1
00:00:00,410 --> 00:00:02,569
Today, the last journey
of Adventure by Accident Two...

2
00:00:02,569 --> 00:00:06,309
that many people
have been looking forward to will start.

3
00:00:07,209 --> 00:00:09,179
Thank you for joining us
for the last episode.

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:11,349
- Thank you always.
- Thank you always.

5
00:00:11,349 --> 00:00:12,580
Thank you.

6
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,449
Finally, we can watch the actual episode.

7
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:15,990
Yes. We only watched the teaser...

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,519
- Yes. Finally.
- for nine weeks.

9
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:19,289
I heard Pani Bottle...

10
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,160
is having a great time...

11
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:23,429
traveling somewhere in Africa.

12
00:00:23,429 --> 00:00:25,059
He's busy.

13
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:26,929
The last journey of Kian84...

14
00:00:26,929 --> 00:00:28,929
who went to India by accident.

15
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:29,929
Let's watch it together.

16
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:30,969
(It begins now.)

17
00:00:30,969 --> 00:00:32,700
(Day 10, at 8 p.m.)

18
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:34,469
Let's go eat.

19
00:00:34,770 --> 00:00:36,539
Go.

20
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,210
(It's time to try temple food in India
which he was curious about.)

21
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:41,850
(Seven boy monks are walking in a line.)

22
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:43,049
They're walking in order.

23
00:00:43,619 --> 00:00:45,179
What is he wrapped with?

24
00:00:45,450 --> 00:00:47,590
- It's a Buddhist monk's robe.
- He became one of them.

25
00:00:49,490 --> 00:00:50,960
Is the food in an Indian temple different?

26
00:00:53,289 --> 00:00:54,960
- What was it? He got some porridge.
- He's cute.

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:57,759
It's quite simple. Is that it?

28
00:00:58,299 --> 00:01:00,100
- Yes. It was pretty much porridge.
- Porridge?

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:01,670
The porridge was quite thin.

30
00:01:01,869 --> 00:01:03,570
They don't eat something heavy.

31
00:01:04,769 --> 00:01:07,540
(Lastly, it's Boy Monk84's turn.)

32
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:09,739
Okay.

33
00:01:09,739 --> 00:01:10,879
(Bowing)

34
00:01:12,379 --> 00:01:15,709
(A light meal in the Korzok Temple)

35
00:01:18,049 --> 00:01:20,549
(They pray together before eating.)

36
00:01:23,219 --> 00:01:24,920
Oh, it's...

37
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:28,359
(He quickly glances around to copy them.)

38
00:01:28,359 --> 00:01:30,829
(Gibberish)

39
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:34,099
It was Buddhist scriptures in Ladakhi.

40
00:01:34,769 --> 00:01:36,129
(Random words)

41
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,040
Save us, merciful Buddha.

42
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:40,239
I said it in the Korean version.

43
00:01:40,769 --> 00:01:41,909
Thank you for the food.

44
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:43,310
(He chanted Buddhist scriptures in Korean
before eating.)

45
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:47,480
(Savoring)

46
00:01:48,209 --> 00:01:49,409
- Delicious.
- Delicious?

47
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:51,019
- Delicious.
- What did it taste like?

48
00:01:51,650 --> 00:01:52,849
It was salty porridge.

49
00:01:52,849 --> 00:01:54,250
- Salty porridge?
- Salty porridge.

50
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:56,390
(The monk hands him something.)

51
00:01:56,390 --> 00:01:58,019
- Spicy.
- Spicy?

52
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,530
- Pickles.
- Pickles?

53
00:02:00,730 --> 00:02:02,459
It's like a side dish.

54
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,500
Fortunately, we have a side dish.

55
00:02:04,730 --> 00:02:05,959
Spicy pickles.

56
00:02:05,959 --> 00:02:07,469
(He has a bite with spicy pickles.)

57
00:02:08,469 --> 00:02:09,800
(Exclaiming)

58
00:02:10,669 --> 00:02:11,669
Gosh, it's spicy.

59
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,069
- Is it?
- Is it spicy?

60
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,270
It's Monk Saliva.

61
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,340
(Meanwhile, 6-year-old Monk Saliva
who was drooling earlier)

62
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:18,539
A child like him is eating spicy food.

63
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,780
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

64
00:02:21,250 --> 00:02:22,250
Gosh.

65
00:02:22,849 --> 00:02:24,050
He's enjoying it.

66
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,289
He's cute.

67
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:32,090
(They're enjoying the meal
without complaining about the food.)

68
00:02:34,729 --> 00:02:36,759
(The Crying Monk who is the youngest
is drinking out of the bowl.)

69
00:02:36,759 --> 00:02:37,759
He's enjoying it so much.

70
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:38,830
- He's cute.
- He's cute.

71
00:02:38,830 --> 00:02:39,860
Oh, my.

72
00:02:40,699 --> 00:02:41,729
Bottoms up.

73
00:02:42,669 --> 00:02:44,900
Kids won't get full with this.

74
00:02:46,469 --> 00:02:51,110
Can these people get a refill?

75
00:02:51,939 --> 00:02:53,610
Can they get a refill?

76
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:55,310
- Can they get a refill?
- "Can they?"

77
00:02:55,580 --> 00:02:57,449
- This...
- Because it makes you feel hungry soon.

78
00:02:57,449 --> 00:02:58,750
Can they get a refill?

79
00:02:58,750 --> 00:02:59,819
- Yes.
- That's a relief.

80
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:00,819
(Yes, they can.)

81
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:02,219
One bowl of this isn't enough.

82
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,659
They would be really hungry.

83
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,930
(Monk Saliva finished a bowl.)

84
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,090
- Gosh.
- He can get a refill.

85
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:11,259
He's eating so well.

86
00:03:11,259 --> 00:03:12,300
- He'll grow taller.
- Oh, my.

87
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:14,000
- He's cute.
- You should eat well when you're young.

88
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:17,300
(He's back with a bowl full of porridge.)

89
00:03:18,539 --> 00:03:20,240
(Slurping)

90
00:03:20,710 --> 00:03:23,370
He's eating in a rush,
dropping food on his hand.

91
00:03:24,009 --> 00:03:25,710
Monk.

92
00:03:26,009 --> 00:03:27,710
What time do we sleep?

93
00:03:27,979 --> 00:03:29,310
Nine o'clock.

94
00:03:29,310 --> 00:03:30,419
- Nine?
- Nine o'clock.

95
00:03:30,419 --> 00:03:31,550
Nine o'clock?

96
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:34,719
- Do we wake up in the morning at 10?
- In the morning, 6 o'clock.

97
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,360
- In the morning, six o'clock?
- That's when we get up.

98
00:03:37,590 --> 00:03:40,330
So we go to bed at 10 p.m.
and wake up at 6 a.m.

99
00:03:40,330 --> 00:03:41,530
(It's 9, not 10.)

100
00:03:41,689 --> 00:03:45,229
At school, how many teachers are there?

101
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:47,129
- Two teachers.
- Two teachers?

102
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:49,500
The kids go to school in the daytime.

103
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,240
- Tomorrow...
- There must be a school they go to.

104
00:03:52,139 --> 00:03:53,569
When they go to school,

105
00:03:53,909 --> 00:03:55,539
I want to see them taking classes.

106
00:03:55,539 --> 00:03:57,840
With the teacher's permission,

107
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,909
I'd like to teach them how to paint.

108
00:04:00,849 --> 00:04:05,280
I think I go to school.

109
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:07,449
To teach them how to paint.

110
00:04:08,449 --> 00:04:10,520
Because I'm a Korean...

111
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,919
cartoonist and painter.

112
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,259
Okay. Yes.

113
00:04:14,430 --> 00:04:15,759
Is that okay?

114
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:17,329
- Tomorrow?
- Tomorrow. Yes.

115
00:04:17,329 --> 00:04:18,899
- Okay.
- Okay.

116
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,129
(He's going to teach us
how to paint tomorrow.)

117
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:24,500
I taught students in
after-school art classes for a long time.

118
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,810
- Four years.
- I didn't know you had that experience.

119
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,110
I was a part-time teacher for a long time
when I was in my 20s.

120
00:04:31,439 --> 00:04:32,709
So I'm familiar with it.

121
00:04:32,709 --> 00:04:34,810
(Teacher84 is coming soon.)

122
00:04:35,509 --> 00:04:36,509
(It seems the monk has something to say.)

123
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,079
- At 1 p.m.,
- Yes.

124
00:04:38,079 --> 00:04:41,750
I have some work in the city. I will go.

125
00:04:42,519 --> 00:04:45,519
Can you take care of our students?

126
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,589
Yes.

127
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:47,990
And...

128
00:04:48,629 --> 00:04:51,430
- He had other things to do.
- Yes, he did.

129
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,029
Is there anything he can do
with the children?

130
00:04:54,329 --> 00:04:56,800
What would they like the most?

131
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,269
They don't go to Internet cafes.

132
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:02,310
They don't go to cram schools.

133
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:06,009
There's no fish to catch either.

134
00:05:07,449 --> 00:05:09,009
Shall we play with marbles?

135
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,850
- Do they sell marbles?
- They...

136
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,050
They like playing cricket.

137
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:17,720
Tomorrow, you will go to play cricket.

138
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:19,759
Yes. Okay.

139
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,029
- Try that.
- Okay.

140
00:05:21,829 --> 00:05:23,360
I should be the referee
because I'll get tired.

141
00:05:23,829 --> 00:05:27,470
- Together, we play.
- Play cricket.

142
00:05:28,029 --> 00:05:29,199
- Happy?
- Happy?

143
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:30,199
- Happy.
- Happy.
Happy.

144
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,939
And the winner of the game...

145
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:37,610
will get my present.
I'll give you a present.

146
00:05:39,379 --> 00:05:42,649
- You made them competitive.
- Yes.

147
00:05:42,649 --> 00:05:44,649
- Children will do their best for a gift.
- Right.

148
00:05:44,649 --> 00:05:46,220
And he doesn't have to run.

149
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,220
- Because he's a referee.
- Right.

150
00:05:47,220 --> 00:05:48,720
I'll die if I run there.

151
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:51,519
Okay.

152
00:05:51,519 --> 00:05:53,220
- Look at them walking in a row.
- They're in a row.

153
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,259
In a row.

154
00:05:54,259 --> 00:05:56,930
Left foot.

155
00:05:58,100 --> 00:06:00,629
The line isn't straight, gentlemen.

156
00:06:02,269 --> 00:06:03,699
Wash the dishes thoroughly.

157
00:06:04,769 --> 00:06:05,870
(They're washing their own dishes
with their small hands.)

158
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,000
- They do the dishes too?
- They do the dishes?

159
00:06:07,709 --> 00:06:09,540
- Oh, my.
- They wash their own dishes.

160
00:06:10,139 --> 00:06:11,810
- We do that in the boot camp too.
- Yes.

161
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,079
- You wash your own dishes.
- You can think of these kids...

162
00:06:13,079 --> 00:06:14,079
as having lived in a boot camp...

163
00:06:14,079 --> 00:06:15,910
since they were five years old.

164
00:06:16,949 --> 00:06:20,920
(It's cold
and the temperature is minus 10℃.)

165
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:26,819
(But they're washing the dishes
with bare hands to practice asceticism.)

166
00:06:28,660 --> 00:06:30,360
Okay. Finished.

167
00:06:31,529 --> 00:06:34,529
(They're back to the room.)

168
00:06:35,230 --> 00:06:36,430
Oh, gosh.

169
00:06:38,569 --> 00:06:40,069
Get ready to go to bed. That's right.

170
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:43,709
(They suddenly pick up bags?)

171
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:47,079
- Take it.
- What are they taking out?

172
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:50,579
Put the books in your bag.

173
00:06:50,579 --> 00:06:51,649
(Hold on.)

174
00:06:51,649 --> 00:06:52,850
Is it time for homework?

175
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,389
It's time for homework.

176
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:56,420
I think it's time for homework.

177
00:06:56,949 --> 00:07:00,290
I thought they were mischievous,
but they do what they have to do.

178
00:07:00,829 --> 00:07:03,089
(Bored)

179
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,430
What kind of homework is this?

180
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:08,269
Are you finding a landmine?

181
00:07:09,899 --> 00:07:11,199
What is this homework for?

182
00:07:11,839 --> 00:07:13,269
Oh, they were learning addition.

183
00:07:14,110 --> 00:07:17,240
(He's looking at his homework
right next to the boy monk.)

184
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:19,779
Why is he not doing his homework?

185
00:07:20,949 --> 00:07:23,009
- It's...
- He's cute.

186
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:25,879
Do you want me to help you?

187
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:27,620
Do you want me to help you?

188
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,519
(After peeking for a while, he volunteers
to help them with the homework.)

189
00:07:30,959 --> 00:07:33,120
- "Week."
- "Weak."

190
00:07:33,589 --> 00:07:35,329
Is it "week" as in "the last week?"

191
00:07:35,529 --> 00:07:36,959
It's "weak."

192
00:07:36,959 --> 00:07:38,329
- "Steam."
- Stem.

193
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,829
- Stem.
- Hot water. Stamp.

194
00:07:40,829 --> 00:07:42,430
Oh, it's "stamp."

195
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:45,569
I don't think he needs your help.

196
00:07:45,569 --> 00:07:48,970
(He's a distraction.)

197
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,709
So inside...

198
00:07:52,610 --> 00:07:54,850
"Climbers such as..."

199
00:07:55,949 --> 00:07:57,420
"grapevine?"

200
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,079
What is it?

201
00:07:59,079 --> 00:08:00,379
(Grapevine)

202
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:02,149
Okay.

203
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,990
I have no idea what it means.

204
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:10,129
(He returns the homework to the owner.)

205
00:08:11,029 --> 00:08:12,529
(Yawning)

206
00:08:12,529 --> 00:08:14,430
- Oh, my.
- I'm tired now.

207
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:18,639
(In front of children who are studying,)

208
00:08:19,870 --> 00:08:20,910
Oh, my.

209
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:22,769
(the 38-year-old closed the school gates.)

210
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:27,879
(It's the children who are studying,)

211
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,680
Gosh.

212
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:31,819
(but he's the one who feels tired.)

213
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:35,789
Kids, that's enough. Let's go to bed.

214
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,320
(The homework time ended
as it's time to go to bed.)

215
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,289
Yes. Let's get your blankets and sleep.

216
00:08:42,289 --> 00:08:43,330
(Please)

217
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:47,129
(They get ready to go to bed
on their own.)

218
00:08:47,129 --> 00:08:48,929
- Was there a heater?
- No, there wasn't.

219
00:08:49,129 --> 00:08:50,200
- It must've been cold.
- It was literally...

220
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:52,169
like the boot camp in Nonsan in February.

221
00:08:52,169 --> 00:08:54,070
I heard the village doesn't have...

222
00:08:54,070 --> 00:08:55,470
enough electricity and water.

223
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:58,610
So other people in the village
have a similar lifestyle.

224
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:02,379
(Kian84 is ready to sleep as well.)

225
00:09:02,379 --> 00:09:03,919
Gosh, this is nice.

226
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,019
(Meanwhile, the eldest monk
spreads the blanket.)

227
00:09:07,389 --> 00:09:09,450
- Oh, my.
- He's kind.

228
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,159
- Oh, my. Thank you.
- My gosh.

229
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,360
(Touched)

230
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
Thank you.

231
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:18,330
- Oh, my.
- How kind.

232
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:19,659
- He's meticulous.
- The eldest is taking good care...

233
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:20,730
of the younger ones.

234
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:22,070
Sweet dreams.

235
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,299
The eldest is doing well.

236
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,470
The eldest monk. He's 18.

237
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,740
I personally called him Monk Buakaw.

238
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,980
Buakaw.

239
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:34,909
- Monk Buakaw.
- He has sharp and smart eyes.

240
00:09:34,909 --> 00:09:36,149
And who else was there?

241
00:09:36,149 --> 00:09:37,480
(Kian84 introduces the 7 boy monks.)

242
00:09:37,879 --> 00:09:39,350
There was a handsome one.

243
00:09:39,649 --> 00:09:40,950
Monk Handsome.

244
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,490
- Monk Handsome.
- Handsome.

245
00:09:42,490 --> 00:09:43,919
He was wearing a bad boy cap.

246
00:09:43,919 --> 00:09:46,460
Bad Boy is the one
whose head is shaved badly.

247
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:47,490
"Bad Boy."

248
00:09:47,690 --> 00:09:50,899
I remember him as a very quiet one.

249
00:09:51,399 --> 00:09:53,659
- Monk Observer.
- "Monk Observer."

250
00:09:53,659 --> 00:09:54,769
The observer.

251
00:09:55,299 --> 00:09:58,000
The one who was wearing
"The Nightmare" scarf in black and red.

252
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,299
Monk Nightmare.

253
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:00,399
(Monk Nightmare, 9 years old)

254
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,169
There was the one who drooled a lot.

255
00:10:03,169 --> 00:10:04,909
- He's Monk Saliva.
- "Monk Saliva."

256
00:10:04,909 --> 00:10:07,480
- And there was Crying Monk.
- Oh, my.

257
00:10:07,679 --> 00:10:09,509
He's the youngest.

258
00:10:09,509 --> 00:10:11,179
- Was he nodding off while eating?
- He's five years old.

259
00:10:11,179 --> 00:10:12,919
He's studying to become a monk
at that age.

260
00:10:13,419 --> 00:10:15,490
(They're so cute.)

261
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,289
- Good night.
- Good night.

262
00:10:20,289 --> 00:10:22,129
- Good night.
- Bye.

263
00:10:23,159 --> 00:10:25,559
(Coming closer)

264
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,600
(Monk Bad Boy wants to film Kian TV.)

265
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,830
Are you filming me?

266
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:31,899
(Bad Boy TV)

267
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:34,340
It was a very long day.

268
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,009
It's getting more tiring every day.

269
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,210
I'm so tired.

270
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,649
(Today was especially a long day.)

271
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:47,080
(He woke up in the morning at the campsite
at 4,400m above sea level.)

272
00:10:48,149 --> 00:10:50,120
(He started his day refreshingly
with dry-heaves.)

273
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:53,759
(After spending a short morning
with the other guys, he said goodbye.)

274
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:55,590
- It's weird to see myself in the video.
- Good luck.

275
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:56,929
- Bye.
- Good luck.

276
00:10:57,860 --> 00:11:01,269
(The journey by himself began again.)

277
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,799
(Half excited and half scared,
he had mixed feelings.)

278
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:07,539
(Dry-heaving)

279
00:11:07,539 --> 00:11:09,210
(Dry-heaving again)

280
00:11:09,909 --> 00:11:11,710
He made new friends soon.

281
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:12,710
- Yes.
- This is great.

282
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,940
(After traveling a long distance,
he met new people, which wasn't easy.)

283
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:17,049
It all happened in one day.

284
00:11:17,649 --> 00:11:19,049
Why is the day not ending?

285
00:11:19,049 --> 00:11:21,350
(Why is the day not ending?)

286
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:22,750
(He was extremely busy
in a place isolated from civilization.)

287
00:11:22,750 --> 00:11:24,889
Why is the day not ending?

288
00:11:24,889 --> 00:11:26,320
It feels like it's not the same 24 hours.

289
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,360
- I know.
- It's like a dream.

290
00:11:28,059 --> 00:11:29,490
Let's turn off the light.

291
00:11:29,759 --> 00:11:31,429
The light. How there?

292
00:11:31,429 --> 00:11:33,230
"How dare?"
"How dare we keep the light on?"

293
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:34,529
- "How dare you turn on the light?"
- We can't turn it off?

294
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:37,370
- No. It goes off at 11 p.m.
- No.

295
00:11:37,539 --> 00:11:39,840
- I see. At 11 p.m.
- Yes. It goes off at 11 p.m.

296
00:11:39,899 --> 00:11:43,370
Hey, it will go off at 10 p.m.

297
00:11:44,179 --> 00:11:45,580
Okay. Let's go to sleep.

298
00:11:46,009 --> 00:11:47,139
Sleep!

299
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,279
Sleep!

300
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:49,409
(He goes to sleep...)

301
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:50,509
How cute.

302
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:51,879
Let's go to sleep.

303
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:53,080
(with the 7 boy monks
like a happy family.)

304
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:03,090
- It was cold there.
- Was it cold?

305
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,200
(How's his morning in Korzok Village
with the 7 boy monks?)

306
00:12:07,330 --> 00:12:08,700
(The 7 boy monks are all awake.)

307
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:10,299
It got lively when it was time to wake up.

308
00:12:10,769 --> 00:12:12,470
(Where's Kian84?)

309
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,039
(Coughing)

310
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:15,070
Oh, no.

311
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,470
Because it was cold?

312
00:12:17,509 --> 00:12:19,279
(Peeking)

313
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:21,450
(Half asleep)

314
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:24,350
Wake up, everyone.

315
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,879
It's the morning roll call.

316
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:30,789
The boys were well-disciplined.

317
00:12:31,590 --> 00:12:34,289
(Kian84 who just woke up
gets up with the boys.)

318
00:12:34,490 --> 00:12:35,659
I'll do it with you.

319
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:38,759
(Kian84 helps the boys
with disheveled hair.)

320
00:12:38,759 --> 00:12:40,159
Gosh. I should have washed my hair.

321
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,269
(He helps out the eldest boy monk.)

322
00:12:44,399 --> 00:12:47,169
That's right. You have to fold it neatly.
You have to keep the angles sharp.

323
00:12:47,299 --> 00:12:50,039
I think those boys will fit in better
at the military camp than Dex.

324
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:53,679
(He's trying to rest up in a corner.)

325
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,679
Everyone, sit down.

326
00:12:56,850 --> 00:12:57,879
(The 7 boy monks sit nicely in a row.)

327
00:12:57,879 --> 00:12:58,980
Gosh. What's going on?

328
00:12:59,980 --> 00:13:02,519
(They start reciting Buddhist scriptures
in the morning.)

329
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,159
I see. They do that
as soon as they wake up.

330
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:06,960
They were reviewing the scriptures...

331
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:10,090
they had learned thus far in the morning.
They chanted in the morning.

332
00:13:11,059 --> 00:13:13,029
(Glancing)

333
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,200
(Approaching)

334
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,909
(He steps back and naturally joins them.)

335
00:13:21,769 --> 00:13:24,139
(What's this?)

336
00:13:28,250 --> 00:13:30,279
You can't even read it, though.

337
00:13:30,549 --> 00:13:31,879
- I can't read it at all.
- Right.

338
00:13:32,049 --> 00:13:34,350
Do the boy monks study every single day?

339
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:36,419
- They do that every morning?
- Yes.

340
00:13:36,419 --> 00:13:38,990
- Gosh. That's amazing.
- They do it to be enlightened.

341
00:13:39,789 --> 00:13:42,860
(Unlike the 7 boy monks who are chanting
at the top of their lungs,)

342
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,870
(he's the only one staying quiet.)

343
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,769
(He feels left out for some reason.)

344
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:58,039
In the morning, they chanted...

345
00:13:58,039 --> 00:14:00,409
the Buddhist scriptures.
I mean they are monks, after all.

346
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:03,509
But I didn't know what they were saying.
I can't read...

347
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:05,250
the letters at all.

348
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:09,049
(He unexpectedly comes face-to-face
with the language barrier.)

349
00:14:10,019 --> 00:14:12,690
Where are you, Pani Bottle?

350
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,259
Where are you, Dex?

351
00:14:15,259 --> 00:14:16,559
His eyes are out of focus.

352
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:20,299
I miss you guys

353
00:14:21,029 --> 00:14:24,169
Where have you gone, leaving me here?

354
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:29,539
India

355
00:14:29,909 --> 00:14:33,610
India is not easy here

356
00:14:34,139 --> 00:14:35,179
(Zoning out)

357
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:40,649
(For some reason, he feels empty inside.)

358
00:14:41,389 --> 00:14:45,389
I want to eat kimchi jjigae

359
00:14:45,389 --> 00:14:48,259
- He means it.
- I want to eat jokbal with soju

360
00:14:48,259 --> 00:14:49,990
He's following
his stream of consciousness.

361
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:51,929
I kept spitting out words
after hearing them chant.

362
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,159
(The 7 boy monks are reciting
the Buddhist scriptures.)

363
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:57,269
Sashimi with soju

364
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:59,600
Roe soup with soju

365
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,570
If I could go to sleep after a drink

366
00:15:02,570 --> 00:15:06,009
I would have nothing to wish for

367
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:07,710
(Chuckling)

368
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,950
He's getting close to enlightenment.

369
00:15:11,379 --> 00:15:13,350
(Pulling his sleeves)

370
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,220
(Blowing out his nose)

371
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,490
What? On your clothes?

372
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:20,559
Gosh. Why is my nose so itchy?

373
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:24,159
The chanting session is quite long.

374
00:15:24,330 --> 00:15:26,899
Gosh. They can stay focused
for a long time.

375
00:15:26,899 --> 00:15:28,200
- They are studying hard.
- Yes.

376
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,169
(Glancing)

377
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:32,740
(Fidgeting)

378
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:35,769
(As he observes the 7 boy monks,
chanting the scriptures...)

379
00:15:37,539 --> 00:15:40,139
(You love me, but I'm sorry,
I'm a bad boy)

380
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,809
Is he okay?

381
00:15:44,080 --> 00:15:45,149
He's in trouble now.

382
00:15:46,419 --> 00:15:47,620
That's an unholy song to sing.

383
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:48,990
He said, "bad boy."

384
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:52,419
Gosh. The boy monk is very surprised.

385
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:53,460
(Flustered)

386
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,889
(He starts singing the next song
without any delay.)

387
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:01,169
(Without knowing why, he starts singing.)

388
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:04,029
He's like, "What's wrong with that uncle?"

389
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:05,639
(What's going on with him?)

390
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,240
Those boys must be thinking,

391
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:09,840
- "I see. He's praying too."
- Right.

392
00:16:10,269 --> 00:16:12,009
(Their eyes are fixed on him.)

393
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:14,139
But I think that's very natural.

394
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:15,950
He can't check his cell phone there.

395
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,080
- Right.
- Yes.

396
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:20,220
I was talking to myself
and then started singing.

397
00:16:20,549 --> 00:16:23,490
During this process,
I might be enlightened.

398
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:25,360
I was just following
my stream of consciousness.

399
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,590
- Right. That's all you could do.
- Yes. It's okay as long as he was happy.

400
00:16:27,590 --> 00:16:28,759
(He happily chants his own scriptures.)

401
00:16:29,230 --> 00:16:31,360
(They are puzzled by Kian84's chanting.)

402
00:16:33,159 --> 00:16:35,200
(Fascinated)

403
00:16:35,899 --> 00:16:38,370
(I'm going to recite
my own Buddhist scriptures.)

404
00:16:39,570 --> 00:16:41,470
(Scriptures84)

405
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:42,870
- "How disrespectful."
- He looked.

406
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,409
(Hey.)

407
00:16:48,409 --> 00:16:50,149
(Look at him.)

408
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:51,950
(Tapping)

409
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:54,389
(Sharing the news to the eldest boy monk)

410
00:16:54,750 --> 00:16:56,490
What should I sing next?

411
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,220
What are some scriptures that I know of?

412
00:16:59,220 --> 00:17:00,990
There was a rhythm to this.

413
00:17:01,129 --> 00:17:02,659
You were reciting your own scriptures.

414
00:17:02,659 --> 00:17:05,200
What are some scriptures that I know of?
Let's see.

415
00:17:06,130 --> 00:17:08,970
(He keeps chanting his scriptures.)

416
00:17:10,369 --> 00:17:12,539
(The song she liked)

417
00:17:12,539 --> 00:17:13,539
(Coughing)

418
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,509
(Retching)

419
00:17:16,210 --> 00:17:18,740
(The more he looks at Kian84,
the more intrigued he becomes.)

420
00:17:19,779 --> 00:17:21,349
(Doing the lip trill)

421
00:17:23,849 --> 00:17:25,880
(Scriptures84 starts warming up
his throat in earnest.)

422
00:17:26,049 --> 00:17:28,420
(Humming)

423
00:17:29,349 --> 00:17:30,420
Hello?

424
00:17:31,319 --> 00:17:32,359
Hello?

425
00:17:32,359 --> 00:17:33,920
- What's going on? What was that?
- What is gotten into him?

426
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,730
("Lies" by BigBang)

427
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,900
(Oh, my goodness)

428
00:17:37,900 --> 00:17:39,299
He sings that all the time.

429
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:40,930
I wasn't myself.

430
00:17:41,369 --> 00:17:44,329
(I'm so sorry, but I love you,
that was all a lie)

431
00:17:45,740 --> 00:17:47,940
(When the boy monks are chanting
the sacred scriptures,)

432
00:17:48,539 --> 00:17:50,710
(Kian84's scriptures sound unholy
for some reason.)

433
00:17:50,710 --> 00:17:52,279
He's really following
his stream of consciousness.

434
00:17:56,009 --> 00:17:58,180
(As they chant their own scriptures,)

435
00:17:58,450 --> 00:18:00,019
(Kian84's scriptures...)

436
00:18:00,019 --> 00:18:01,720
(are accompanied by
the eldest boy monk's scriptures.)

437
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,460
(You still don't know)

438
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,990
(As Kian84 sings passionately
with all of his heart,)

439
00:18:07,390 --> 00:18:09,630
(the 7 boy monks harmonize with him.)

440
00:18:10,029 --> 00:18:12,930
(The man who has you)

441
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,269
(They are reaching the climax.)

442
00:18:17,029 --> 00:18:19,200
(Please)

443
00:18:19,940 --> 00:18:25,380
(Don't leave me)

444
00:18:25,609 --> 00:18:28,710
(The scripture orchestra
by Scriptures84 and the 7 boy monks)

445
00:18:29,250 --> 00:18:30,410
Did it last about 30 minutes?

446
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,980
- It lasted an hour.
- I see.

447
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:33,480
- It's finally over.
- Gosh.

448
00:18:33,750 --> 00:18:35,119
Gosh, they gave it their all.

449
00:18:35,819 --> 00:18:38,119
But it did clear up my head.

450
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,589
- Have breakfast.
- Breakfast.

451
00:18:40,589 --> 00:18:41,630
Come here.

452
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,460
They're carefully wrapping the books
with the cloth.

453
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,029
Let's wrap it up.

454
00:18:46,029 --> 00:18:47,059
(Right here.)

455
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,500
(He gets Kian84's help
to put away the book.)

456
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:52,569
(Feeling proud)

457
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:55,109
(He quickly puts on his bag.)

458
00:18:55,109 --> 00:18:57,309
Let's go and eat.

459
00:18:58,410 --> 00:19:00,480
- Do you still have the bag?
- Of course.

460
00:19:02,579 --> 00:19:03,950
I see. Breakfast.

461
00:19:04,250 --> 00:19:06,519
(Lining up)

462
00:19:07,049 --> 00:19:08,450
We're getting bread for breakfast.

463
00:19:09,490 --> 00:19:10,549
(Bread with strawberry jam and butter)

464
00:19:10,549 --> 00:19:11,859
- It smells nice.
- Gosh, that looks good.

465
00:19:11,859 --> 00:19:14,089
- It looks like a real breakfast.
- It's an English breakfast.

466
00:19:14,089 --> 00:19:15,730
- Nice.
- That was really good.

467
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,789
That does look good.

468
00:19:16,789 --> 00:19:18,500
- Of course, it's bound to taste good.
- Yes.

469
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
(Spreading the strawberry jam generously)

470
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,269
- Gosh. The butter too.
- The bread looks tasty.

471
00:19:22,369 --> 00:19:24,170
At the bootcamp in Nonsan,
you can't get refills.

472
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:25,539
- But there...
- Can you get refills?

473
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:28,339
- You can get the jam 2 or 3 more times.
- That must have been good.

474
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:30,109
That small boy is having two.

475
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,940
(Two pieces of bread)

476
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,849
(They don't forget to pray
before the meal.)

477
00:19:35,309 --> 00:19:37,049
(Mumbling something
to the best of his ability)

478
00:19:37,109 --> 00:19:39,019
You can sort of copy them now.

479
00:19:39,819 --> 00:19:42,220
(Everyone is praying
while holding the bread with one hand.)

480
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:45,190
(He glances around and does the same.)

481
00:19:48,259 --> 00:19:49,490
Thank you for the food.

482
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:51,529
Gosh, that looks good.

483
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,829
- Gosh. It must be good.
- Goodness.

484
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:57,940
That looks like a pastry.

485
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,299
- It must be crunchy.
- It looks tasty.

486
00:20:01,710 --> 00:20:03,309
(Munching)

487
00:20:04,140 --> 00:20:06,339
(Monk Saliva is eating the food
with gusto.)

488
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:08,849
(But this guy is enjoying the food
more than Monk Saliva.)

489
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:10,109
You look starved.

490
00:20:12,150 --> 00:20:13,319
He wiped his nose on that sleeve.

491
00:20:13,319 --> 00:20:14,420
Right. It's sweet and salty.

492
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:17,789
Ki, is the bread very delicious?

493
00:20:18,059 --> 00:20:19,789
- Delicious.
- Do you like it?

494
00:20:19,789 --> 00:20:21,829
- Yes.
- Okay.

495
00:20:22,329 --> 00:20:24,430
When are they going to school?

496
00:20:24,430 --> 00:20:26,230
- Nine o'clock.
- Nine o'clock.

497
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:28,269
Does a monk teach them?

498
00:20:29,630 --> 00:20:31,740
- Science.
- Science.

499
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
What's math in English?

500
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:36,210
- What's math in English?
- Math.

501
00:20:36,269 --> 00:20:39,009
- Mathematics.
- He can understand Korean.

502
00:20:39,009 --> 00:20:41,450
- Hindi. English.
- Hindi. Yes.

503
00:20:41,450 --> 00:20:43,150
- Bhoti.
- Bhoti.

504
00:20:43,410 --> 00:20:45,549
- You teach them?
- Five subjects.

505
00:20:45,549 --> 00:20:46,650
- I teach.
- Gosh.

506
00:20:46,650 --> 00:20:48,220
It turns out he also teaches them.

507
00:20:48,220 --> 00:20:50,119
- He's a teacher too.
- I see.

508
00:20:50,119 --> 00:20:52,359
In elementary school,
our homeroom teacher taught...

509
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,990
- every subject.
- They taught us everything.

510
00:20:53,990 --> 00:20:56,490
Then do you also teach them art?

511
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:59,799
I teach them everything I know.

512
00:21:02,029 --> 00:21:03,769
(He shoves
in the last piece of his bread.)

513
00:21:04,069 --> 00:21:05,539
He's cleaning up too.

514
00:21:08,009 --> 00:21:09,440
(Staring)

515
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,309
Do you want a present?

516
00:21:11,309 --> 00:21:12,509
- What?
- All of a sudden?

517
00:21:12,509 --> 00:21:14,180
- Show me your hands.
- What present?

518
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,849
(Show me your hands.)

519
00:21:18,220 --> 00:21:20,220
Come on.

520
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:21,549
(Feeling bad)

521
00:21:23,089 --> 00:21:24,089
Look at his face.

522
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:28,390
(Smirking)

523
00:21:28,789 --> 00:21:31,359
(The useless present makes them laugh.)

524
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,930
Throw it out on the ground.

525
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,730
(Uncle Kian is playful.)

526
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,099
He is playful indeed.

527
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,740
He's cute.

528
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,200
We have to start the class now.

529
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:42,240
Yes.

530
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:44,039
- He told me it was time for school.
- Okay.

531
00:21:44,039 --> 00:21:45,039
- Ready?
- Okay.

532
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:47,309
(They quickly get ready to go to school.)

533
00:21:51,079 --> 00:21:52,720
Let's go together.

534
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,990
Together to school.

535
00:21:55,950 --> 00:21:58,359
(The 7 boy monks are going
to school in a single line.)

536
00:21:58,359 --> 00:22:00,019
- When baby ducks follow their mom,
- So cute.

537
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:02,359
- that's how they walk in a single file.
- Yes. That's right. In a single file.

538
00:22:02,359 --> 00:22:03,690
There's a big duck too.

539
00:22:03,690 --> 00:22:05,029
(There's a big duck too.)

540
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:08,269
(He goes to school
in the monk's robe too.)

541
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:13,369
Well,

542
00:22:13,569 --> 00:22:18,240
it's been 20 years since I went to school
in the morning like this.

543
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,440
Hey!

544
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,950
(A heart-fluttering walk to school
after 20 years)

545
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,609
- They go in a single file.
- They are so cute.

546
00:22:24,609 --> 00:22:26,779
(They got in line based on their height.)

547
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:28,450
It's nice and warm.

548
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:31,519
The school was underneath the temple.

549
00:22:31,859 --> 00:22:33,059
- That's the school?
- Yes.

550
00:22:33,059 --> 00:22:34,089
(This is their school.)

551
00:22:34,829 --> 00:22:35,890
This is the place.

552
00:22:35,890 --> 00:22:37,089
Good morning!

553
00:22:37,089 --> 00:22:40,400
- Good morning!
- Good morning!

554
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,670
It's like a small school
in the countryside.

555
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:43,500
They don't split into different grades.

556
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:44,630
Right. They stay in one class.

557
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,470
Kids, sit down
and take out your notebook and pencils.

558
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,509
Sit down.

559
00:22:51,069 --> 00:22:52,880
(The old student sits down too.)

560
00:22:53,910 --> 00:22:56,380
(The 7 boy monks get their textbooks.)

561
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,619
He must've had the backpack
for a long time. This zipper is broken.

562
00:23:03,519 --> 00:23:05,589
What a beautiful view from the school.

563
00:23:05,589 --> 00:23:06,819
Gosh, look at the view.

564
00:23:09,329 --> 00:23:10,329
(Their 1st class, English)

565
00:23:10,329 --> 00:23:12,329
- English.
- Their first class is English.

566
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,200
Let's go around 1 by 1. You stand up...

567
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,130
and give us your introduction.

568
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:18,299
Okay?

569
00:23:18,569 --> 00:23:20,869
- Kian84 needs to take this class.
- Yes.

570
00:23:20,869 --> 00:23:22,769
(Old-Student84 has come
to the right lecture hall.)

571
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,240
First. You.

572
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:25,640
(Monk Nightmare will go first.)

573
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,339
Hello. Good morning, everyone.

574
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:28,849
My name is Jigmed Skarzan.

575
00:23:28,849 --> 00:23:30,450
His pronunciation is great.

576
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:34,180
My favorite dish is bread with an omelet.

577
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,549
Thank you.

578
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:36,890
- "Thank you."
- "Thank you."

579
00:23:37,119 --> 00:23:39,119
- The last part could've been better.
- Hello. Good morning.

580
00:23:39,589 --> 00:23:41,730
Hello. Good morning, everyone.

581
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:43,390
I am 13 years old.

582
00:23:43,390 --> 00:23:45,559
- He's 13.
- I am 13 years old.

583
00:23:45,559 --> 00:23:47,859
I am ambitious.

584
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:48,900
MBC?

585
00:23:49,400 --> 00:23:50,769
- MBC?
- I am...

586
00:23:50,769 --> 00:23:52,440
I am...

587
00:23:53,299 --> 00:23:55,039
- I am...
- The kids got nervous during class.

588
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,410
(Nervous)

589
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:59,180
- Be confident.
- I am...

590
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:01,339
(Thanks to the old student's cheer,
he regains his confidence.)

591
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,579
- Thank you.
- Yes.

592
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,150
(Crying Monk is up next.)

593
00:24:05,450 --> 00:24:07,180
Hello. Good morning, everyone.

594
00:24:07,180 --> 00:24:09,849
My name is Jigmed Lachok.

595
00:24:11,089 --> 00:24:12,920
(Introducing himself in English
is tough for a 5-year-old.)

596
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:13,990
He's cute.

597
00:24:15,359 --> 00:24:17,630
And you're five years old.

598
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:19,730
- I'm five years old.
- Thank you.

599
00:24:20,559 --> 00:24:22,700
Yes. Stand up.

600
00:24:22,869 --> 00:24:24,900
Hello. My name is Tiring Sandup.

601
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:27,500
- I am...
- This guy was confident.

602
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,609
(The old student is just amused.)

603
00:24:29,609 --> 00:24:31,339
I am...

604
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:33,410
six years old.

605
00:24:34,039 --> 00:24:35,279
Gosh, he's adorable.

606
00:24:36,180 --> 00:24:37,779
I am from Korzok.

607
00:24:37,779 --> 00:24:39,079
Thank you.

608
00:24:39,079 --> 00:24:40,579
Kian84 should introduce himself too
as the last one.

609
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:43,019
Hello. Kim.

610
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:44,720
Yes.

611
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,359
- Your turn.
- Me. Okay.

612
00:24:47,390 --> 00:24:48,630
(Okay.)

613
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:50,089
Your English improved a lot.

614
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:51,490
- Right.
- It did improve.

615
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:52,759
Show them.

616
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:56,400
(See you. I want you to be happy
and want to wish you good luck.)

617
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,769
(He can articulate an advanced sentence.)

618
00:24:59,269 --> 00:25:01,809
(How dare... The right side-view mirror?)

619
00:25:01,809 --> 00:25:04,140
(How dare you drive
without the side-view mirror?)

620
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,809
(He's the founder
of the Thug English in India.)

621
00:25:07,809 --> 00:25:09,180
If you don't know what to say,
say "how dare."

622
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:10,549
English is all about your confidence.

623
00:25:10,549 --> 00:25:12,849
(Old-Student84's introduction
will be the grand finale.)

624
00:25:16,619 --> 00:25:17,950
My name is Kim.

625
00:25:18,819 --> 00:25:19,920
Hee Min.

626
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:23,259
- What?
- Kim Hee Min!

627
00:25:23,259 --> 00:25:25,829
My nickname is Kian84.

628
00:25:25,829 --> 00:25:26,859
"Eighty-four."

629
00:25:26,859 --> 00:25:29,369
And my father's name is Kim.

630
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,769
My mother's name is Yoon.

631
00:25:32,099 --> 00:25:33,140
My...

632
00:25:34,099 --> 00:25:35,109
job.

633
00:25:35,509 --> 00:25:37,410
(Trailing off)

634
00:25:37,410 --> 00:25:38,440
Painter.

635
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:41,309
And...

636
00:25:42,109 --> 00:25:43,150
YouTuber.

637
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:44,680
I have many jobs.

638
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,750
(I have a side job.)

639
00:25:45,750 --> 00:25:46,819
And...

640
00:25:46,819 --> 00:25:49,920
I met you, and I'm very happy.

641
00:25:50,619 --> 00:25:52,619
- I love you.
- Nice to meet you.

642
00:25:57,630 --> 00:25:58,759
(Did I get dumped?)

643
00:25:59,059 --> 00:26:00,259
"Love you too."

644
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:02,369
- I love you too.
- Okay.

645
00:26:03,029 --> 00:26:04,369
There was no reaction from them.

646
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:08,910
(After getting a forced "I-love-you,"
the class begins.)

647
00:26:09,410 --> 00:26:11,539
(The teacher writes something down.)

648
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:13,880
(The old student focuses on it.)

649
00:26:14,839 --> 00:26:16,450
"Boss."

650
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:18,210
"Bosh."

651
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:20,680
"Bosh?"

652
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,950
"Brush."

653
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:25,859
- "Brush."
- "Brush."

654
00:26:25,859 --> 00:26:27,190
- "Them."
- "Them."

655
00:26:27,190 --> 00:26:28,329
- "Every."
- "Every."

656
00:26:28,329 --> 00:26:29,430
- "Day."
- "Day."

657
00:26:29,430 --> 00:26:31,029
- "Father"
- "Father."

658
00:26:31,029 --> 00:26:32,299
- "Mother."
- "Mother."

659
00:26:32,299 --> 00:26:33,660
- "Brother."
- "Brother."

660
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,900
- "Sister."
- "Sister."

661
00:26:34,900 --> 00:26:36,000
- "Brush."
- "Brush."

662
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:39,470
(A class with an easy approach
for the 7 boy monks)

663
00:26:39,670 --> 00:26:42,309
Now, our turn is over.

664
00:26:42,809 --> 00:26:44,240
You come here.

665
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:45,680
(Come here, Monk Bad Boy.)

666
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:46,809
- Brush.
- Brush.

667
00:26:47,009 --> 00:26:48,980
(They come out one at a time
and read the words aloud.)

668
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:51,049
- I see. One at a time.
- One at a time.

669
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,119
Every day.

670
00:26:52,119 --> 00:26:54,250
Brush our teeth every day.

671
00:26:54,549 --> 00:26:55,589
Sandup.

672
00:26:55,589 --> 00:26:57,990
(It's Monk Saliva's turn.)

673
00:26:58,589 --> 00:26:59,920
- Brush.
- Put your hands on your waist. Yes.

674
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:00,990
So cute.

675
00:27:00,990 --> 00:27:02,890
Brush them every day.

676
00:27:02,890 --> 00:27:04,730
- Brush them every day.
- Brush them every day.

677
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,630
Father, mother, brother, sister.

678
00:27:07,630 --> 00:27:09,029
- Father, mother,
- Father, mother,

679
00:27:09,029 --> 00:27:10,630
- brother, sister.
- Why is he so cute?

680
00:27:10,630 --> 00:27:11,869
- Brother, sister.
- Sister.

681
00:27:11,869 --> 00:27:13,039
Every day.

682
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,009
- Brush them every day.
- Brush them every day.

683
00:27:15,009 --> 00:27:16,109
- Every day.
- Every day.

684
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,710
Next, Kim.

685
00:27:18,269 --> 00:27:20,109
- Next, Kim. Come here.
- Okay.

686
00:27:20,109 --> 00:27:21,640
That hurt my pride.

687
00:27:23,609 --> 00:27:26,319
- Brush.
- Brush.

688
00:27:26,519 --> 00:27:28,619
- Your teeth.
- Your teeth.

689
00:27:28,819 --> 00:27:31,289
You must brush your teeth.

690
00:27:31,289 --> 00:27:32,519
You're teaching them Korean too?

691
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:34,920
- "Father." Father.
- Father.

692
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,059
- "Mother." Mother.
- Mother.

693
00:27:37,059 --> 00:27:38,529
- Brother.
- Brother.

694
00:27:38,529 --> 00:27:39,730
- Sister.
- Sister.

695
00:27:40,029 --> 00:27:41,259
- Brush.
- Brush.

696
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:44,470
(He freely speaks to them
both in English and Korean.)

697
00:27:44,799 --> 00:27:46,599
Plus. Floss.

698
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:48,369
You must floss too.

699
00:27:48,369 --> 00:27:49,569
Do you know what that is?

700
00:27:49,569 --> 00:27:51,210
They must floss.

701
00:27:51,210 --> 00:27:52,609
Flossing is important. Yes.

702
00:27:52,609 --> 00:27:54,079
They must learn to floss too.

703
00:27:54,079 --> 00:27:55,849
- They must. People overlook flossing.
- That was sad.

704
00:27:55,849 --> 00:27:57,279
Flossing is important.

705
00:27:57,549 --> 00:27:59,319
- Okay.
- Did you brush your teeth yesterday?

706
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,680
I didn't see you brush your teeth.

707
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:02,990
Did you brush your teeth?

708
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:05,160
Me? I couldn't brush my teeth
for three days.

709
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:09,029
Let's start our next poem.

710
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:10,460
Okay.

711
00:28:10,630 --> 00:28:11,799
- "Away..."
- "Away..."

712
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:12,930
- "from..."
- "from..."

713
00:28:12,930 --> 00:28:15,170
- "the city."
- "the city."

714
00:28:15,170 --> 00:28:17,299
- "Away from the city."
- "Away from the city."

715
00:28:17,299 --> 00:28:19,740
- "Away from the city."
- "Into the sun."

716
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:21,700
Sandup.

717
00:28:23,410 --> 00:28:24,640
Put your hands on your waist.

718
00:28:24,710 --> 00:28:26,740
(He reads it with a powerful pose again.)

719
00:28:26,740 --> 00:28:27,980
- "City."
- "City."

720
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:29,150
- "And..."
- "And..."

721
00:28:29,609 --> 00:28:30,950
- "into..."
- "into..."

722
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:32,819
- "the sun."
- "the sun."

723
00:28:35,089 --> 00:28:37,819
Personally,
I think he's the best one here.

724
00:28:38,289 --> 00:28:40,359
Look how much confidence is exuding
from his back.

725
00:28:41,160 --> 00:28:42,829
Look how confident he looks.

726
00:28:42,829 --> 00:28:43,930
Walking powerfully.

727
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:47,130
Now, our next class is mathematics.

728
00:28:47,130 --> 00:28:48,130
Okay?

729
00:28:48,259 --> 00:28:50,200
- Don't they get a break?
- They don't.

730
00:28:50,200 --> 00:28:52,299
- It's like going to college.
- Back-to-back classes.

731
00:28:53,039 --> 00:28:55,539
I think we're moving on to our math class.

732
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,269
(Approaching)

733
00:28:58,609 --> 00:29:00,380
- You guys got close. He leaned on you.
- What?

734
00:29:01,309 --> 00:29:02,779
Gosh, I'm sleepy.

735
00:29:02,779 --> 00:29:04,079
(Peeking)

736
00:29:05,480 --> 00:29:07,980
(The teacher moves on
to math after English.)

737
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:09,150
Gosh, the monk...

738
00:29:10,190 --> 00:29:12,960
He was very well-received in everything.

739
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,089
(He meant that the monk was
very well-versed in everything.)

740
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:17,859
(He starts with an addition problem.)

741
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,460
Good.

742
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,369
I just spotted something crazy.

743
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:28,000
In India, they write the number, seven,
like "K" in Korean.

744
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,809
"K" like the sound of laughter.

745
00:29:30,970 --> 00:29:32,940
(He continues with the second question.)

746
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,809
He gave different questions
based on the levels of the students.

747
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:43,150
Gosh, this is easy.

748
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,819
(He's ready to write down
the answer right away.)

749
00:29:49,990 --> 00:29:52,160
Goodness. Oh, no.

750
00:29:52,599 --> 00:29:54,099
(You can do it.)

751
00:29:54,529 --> 00:29:56,369
He seems to be struggling.

752
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,670
I see. He's not strong in math.

753
00:30:00,299 --> 00:30:01,369
That's it.

754
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:02,869
Well done.

755
00:30:03,809 --> 00:30:04,809
Next.

756
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:07,410
He won't make Kian84 solve this, right?

757
00:30:07,509 --> 00:30:08,779
- Kim. Come here.
- Yes.

758
00:30:08,779 --> 00:30:09,809
He got one right away.

759
00:30:09,809 --> 00:30:11,920
- This question.
- Come on, don't be like that.

760
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,980
Goodness.

761
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:16,549
- He hurt my pride a bit.
- That's a bit mean.

762
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,089
Gosh.

763
00:30:19,089 --> 00:30:22,789
(I may not look smart, but I underwent
the Korean 6th educational curriculum.)

764
00:30:23,430 --> 00:30:25,059
(Does 8 times 4 equal 32? No, it's wrong.)

765
00:30:25,700 --> 00:30:29,230
(A multiplication table
might be challenging.)

766
00:30:30,170 --> 00:30:33,140
(But addition with two-digit numbers
seems a bit childish for me.)

767
00:30:33,869 --> 00:30:36,009
(He walks up without hesitation.)

768
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:39,140
(Solving the question)

769
00:30:39,140 --> 00:30:41,910
(He finishes it as a student who went
through the 6th educational curriculum.)

770
00:30:43,650 --> 00:30:44,809
What's going on?

771
00:30:44,809 --> 00:30:46,720
(Then he writes something
on the whiteboard.)

772
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,450
(Focused)

773
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:50,319
The price of looking down on me.

774
00:30:52,220 --> 00:30:53,259
Sir.

775
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:56,130
(He challenges the teacher
to a math battle.)

776
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,559
You provoked the teacher.

777
00:30:58,599 --> 00:30:59,900
(The old student's challenge
garners attention.)

778
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,960
How dare you?

779
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:02,730
- That's...
- How dare you?

780
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,869
- You're being rebellious.
- "How dare you?"

781
00:31:06,670 --> 00:31:08,170
Is it my turn?

782
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:11,809
(Old-Student84
playfully provokes the teacher.)

783
00:31:12,509 --> 00:31:14,279
(But the teacher accepts it with a smile.)

784
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:15,579
He's a generous teacher.

785
00:31:15,579 --> 00:31:17,710
But the teacher started it.

786
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,319
(That's pretty hard.)

787
00:31:21,680 --> 00:31:23,420
But did you know the answer?

788
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:25,319
- No.
- He didn't know.

789
00:31:25,619 --> 00:31:26,690
I finished.

790
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:29,490
(The teacher writes down the answer
after calculating the numbers.)

791
00:31:29,490 --> 00:31:31,259
(A wrong answer)

792
00:31:31,259 --> 00:31:32,730
(The right answer is 5,467.5.)

793
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,359
Gosh. It's a twist after a twist.

794
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:36,069
Gosh. Great.

795
00:31:36,069 --> 00:31:37,230
(That's the right answer.)

796
00:31:37,230 --> 00:31:39,500
(Let's just clap.)

797
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,000
- Thank you.
- Everyone is happy.

798
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,039
(It ends with everyone happy.)

799
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:43,569
I thought he got it right.

800
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:45,609
He and I messed up the calculation...

801
00:31:45,609 --> 00:31:46,740
- in the same way.
- Really?

802
00:31:46,740 --> 00:31:49,880
But even if you knew he was wrong,
you wouldn't have said anything.

803
00:31:49,880 --> 00:31:51,750
- Well, if I did that,
- Right.

804
00:31:51,750 --> 00:31:53,849
- his students might not trust him.
- Right.

805
00:31:53,849 --> 00:31:55,220
I would never do anything like that.

806
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:57,920
Actually, I ended up showing them
how smart their teacher was.

807
00:31:58,589 --> 00:32:01,490
The test maker of the CSAT
from Korea presented a question,

808
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:03,490
- You improved his reputation.
- and he got it right. Yes.

809
00:32:05,059 --> 00:32:07,630
(This time,
they will work on multiplication.)

810
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,539
(The multiplication questions
can be difficult.)

811
00:32:13,539 --> 00:32:15,410
Gosh. They are good, though.

812
00:32:15,410 --> 00:32:16,940
(The 7 boy monks calmly solve them.)

813
00:32:18,740 --> 00:32:20,640
(Zoning out)

814
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,549
- Gosh.
- That's a question for KIm.

815
00:32:24,950 --> 00:32:26,349
Kim, come here.

816
00:32:26,349 --> 00:32:27,650
(Kim, solve this.)

817
00:32:27,650 --> 00:32:29,450
- Your turn.
- And look at this.

818
00:32:29,450 --> 00:32:31,549
He gave me a harder question this time.

819
00:32:31,549 --> 00:32:32,890
Yes. This is revenge.

820
00:32:32,890 --> 00:32:34,460
- "How dare you challenge me?"
- Right.

821
00:32:34,460 --> 00:32:35,589
Show them, Kim!

822
00:32:35,589 --> 00:32:37,390
(Kim, show them the power
of the 6th educational curriculum.)

823
00:32:37,589 --> 00:32:39,630
(The old student got called on
when he was spacing out.)

824
00:32:40,529 --> 00:32:42,430
(The old student is attacked
with a multiplication question.)

825
00:32:43,130 --> 00:32:44,170
That's an eight.

826
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,740
(Using his brain at full capacity)

827
00:32:46,740 --> 00:32:48,539
He's using his brain at full capacity now.

828
00:32:49,470 --> 00:32:52,009
It was hard to do math
as it had been so long since I did math.

829
00:32:53,079 --> 00:32:55,509
What's 4 times 8? Is it 24?

830
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,579
It's 32.

831
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:00,680
(He faces an error
with the multiplication table.)

832
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,920
Kim. Please show them you can do it.

833
00:33:03,619 --> 00:33:04,720
Kim. Please.

834
00:33:05,250 --> 00:33:07,460
Eight times four is thirty-two.
That's correct.

835
00:33:07,460 --> 00:33:08,559
It's not.

836
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,960
(The old student falls into
the swamp of 8 times 4.)

837
00:33:10,089 --> 00:33:12,230
- It was the altitude sickness.
- Right. He couldn't have done anything.

838
00:33:13,059 --> 00:33:14,960
(He somehow comes up with an answer.)

839
00:33:15,599 --> 00:33:17,230
You were so close. Gosh.

840
00:33:17,230 --> 00:33:19,470
I see. I got it wrong
because I thought it was 24.

841
00:33:19,470 --> 00:33:20,670
He made a small error.

842
00:33:20,670 --> 00:33:21,769
(After making an error,
he suddenly gets busy.)

843
00:33:21,769 --> 00:33:23,609
- What? Is he redoing it?
- You didn't challenge him again, right?

844
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:26,210
Sir.

845
00:33:26,210 --> 00:33:27,609
(It's your turn, sir.)

846
00:33:27,609 --> 00:33:29,509
Gosh. It's like a dance battle.

847
00:33:29,509 --> 00:33:31,150
It's a math battle.

848
00:33:31,150 --> 00:33:32,250
Your turn.

849
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:36,049
This time...

850
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:40,220
- What is that?
- What is that?

851
00:33:40,759 --> 00:33:42,359
(Laughing)

852
00:33:42,829 --> 00:33:44,730
- That was a vicious move.
- Yes.

853
00:33:44,890 --> 00:33:46,359
- What is that?
- What?

854
00:33:46,559 --> 00:33:48,059
- I mean...
- What is that?

855
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:50,500
- What is this?
- Isn't that a proper question?

856
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:53,200
But it's funny that
they both got the answers wrong.

857
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,170
- What's the point of this?
- Right.

858
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,910
You had to present a question
after you got it right.

859
00:33:57,170 --> 00:33:59,740
(He gives the teacher a fraction question,
not knowing his place.)

860
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:05,210
(The teacher is flustered
at the fraction question.)

861
00:34:06,180 --> 00:34:07,980
(Laughing)

862
00:34:08,349 --> 00:34:10,389
(That's a fraction.)

863
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,489
- I can't solve that.
- Is this a seven?

864
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:15,659
Seven.

865
00:34:15,789 --> 00:34:17,489
Right. I should do this.

866
00:34:18,090 --> 00:34:20,000
I'll follow the local style
of writing a seven.

867
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,960
- "K."
- "K."

868
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:23,199
"K."

869
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:25,170
That's a seven.

870
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:26,599
(A considerate gesture
from the presenter makes him laugh.)

871
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:28,940
- But how do you solve that?
- Right.

872
00:34:29,809 --> 00:34:31,110
Is it hard?

873
00:34:32,079 --> 00:34:33,710
The truth is I can't solve this.

874
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,650
(Meanwhile, the teacher is done
with the calculation.)

875
00:34:36,849 --> 00:34:37,849
(A wrong answer)

876
00:34:37,849 --> 00:34:39,420
What? Is it even close?

877
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:40,920
- No.
- It's completely off.

878
00:34:41,150 --> 00:34:42,650
(Amazed)

879
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,559
But they enjoyed the process.

880
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:47,460
- That was a nice battle.
- Yes.

881
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:48,690
It was a nice battle.

882
00:34:48,690 --> 00:34:51,130
Guys, come to the front...

883
00:34:51,130 --> 00:34:53,800
- and recite the multiplication table.
- The multiplication table.

884
00:34:54,030 --> 00:34:56,070
Here comes the ace.

885
00:34:56,170 --> 00:34:58,170
- The one with his hands around his waist.
- That's it.

886
00:34:58,329 --> 00:34:59,369
Look how confident he is.

887
00:35:00,099 --> 00:35:01,400
(He's adorable.)

888
00:35:01,969 --> 00:35:04,409
(He's reciting the 2 times table
with a powerful pose.)

889
00:35:05,170 --> 00:35:06,480
Two times five is ten.

890
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:07,739
Two times six is twelve.

891
00:35:07,739 --> 00:35:08,849
Two times seven is fourteen.

892
00:35:08,849 --> 00:35:10,650
He started to lose his confidence
around this time.

893
00:35:11,210 --> 00:35:12,250
What's 2 times 9?

894
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:14,050
- What's 2 times 9?
- Gosh.

895
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:15,650
(He regains his confidence
with a powerful pose.)

896
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:17,949
Good job.

897
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:19,619
It's okay to get it wrong.

898
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,260
- Look how confident...
- Kim, come here.

899
00:35:21,260 --> 00:35:22,559
(Kim, come here.)

900
00:35:22,760 --> 00:35:24,960
- He kept calling on me.
- Put your hands on your waist and do it.

901
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,030
Make it look cool.

902
00:35:26,260 --> 00:35:27,829
- Do the nine times table.
- Yes.

903
00:35:27,829 --> 00:35:28,829
- Nine?
- Nine.
The nine times table.

904
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:31,829
Gosh. I can't get this wrong.

905
00:35:34,239 --> 00:35:36,309
- He has to do it in English.
- He must do it in English.

906
00:35:36,309 --> 00:35:37,969
Nine times one is nine.

907
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:41,239
- Nine times two is sixteen.
- Yes?

908
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:42,610
It's eighteen.

909
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:44,150
It's okay. He had to do it in English.

910
00:35:44,610 --> 00:35:47,320
Seven? Eighteen.

911
00:35:48,619 --> 00:35:51,719
Nine times three is thirty-four.

912
00:35:51,719 --> 00:35:54,760
Nine times four is forty-five.

913
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:56,630
He's having a severe case
of the altitude sickness.

914
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,730
Nine times seven...

915
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,000
Nine times seven is forty.

916
00:36:01,099 --> 00:36:03,630
Nine times seven is sixty-four.

917
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,340
Sixty-four.

918
00:36:07,039 --> 00:36:08,239
Nine times eight...

919
00:36:09,670 --> 00:36:11,570
(Be confident!)

920
00:36:11,909 --> 00:36:14,280
Gosh. Come on.

921
00:36:14,909 --> 00:36:16,449
- This is hurting my pride.
- He got a reality check.

922
00:36:16,449 --> 00:36:17,809
Nine times eight is sixty-four.

923
00:36:18,980 --> 00:36:20,179
Nine times eight is sixty-four.

924
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,550
Nine times eight is seventy-two.

925
00:36:23,619 --> 00:36:28,389
Nine times eight is seventy-two.

926
00:36:28,989 --> 00:36:31,630
Nine times nine is eighty-one.

927
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:34,900
- Okay.
- You did well.

928
00:36:34,900 --> 00:36:36,530
I hadn't done that for a while,
so I got confused.

929
00:36:36,530 --> 00:36:38,699
Of course.
And you had to do it in English.

930
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,539
(Plopping down)

931
00:36:40,539 --> 00:36:41,670
Gosh, I'm sleepy.

932
00:36:42,039 --> 00:36:43,739
(When he's embarrassed, he gets sleepy.)

933
00:36:44,039 --> 00:36:45,210
Here's a saying.

934
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,440
If you know up to the three times table,
you won't have a problem living your life.

935
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:49,280
(Extremely positive)

936
00:36:50,809 --> 00:36:54,320
I will go outside now...

937
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,219
because I have some urgent work.

938
00:36:56,219 --> 00:36:57,420
Okay.

939
00:36:57,590 --> 00:37:00,090
- He said he was going out.
- Yes, he said he was leaving.

940
00:37:00,119 --> 00:37:02,489
- You teach for our students.
- Okay.

941
00:37:02,489 --> 00:37:04,130
Draw anything you want.

942
00:37:04,130 --> 00:37:05,630
Okay. I understand.

943
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:07,599
- Take care of them.
- Okay.

944
00:37:07,699 --> 00:37:10,369
I'll come back in the evening time.

945
00:37:10,369 --> 00:37:12,230
- You'll come back in the evening. Okay.
- Okay.

946
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,440
- Have fun.
- Thank you.

947
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:14,469
(The teacher leaves.)

948
00:37:15,539 --> 00:37:16,610
Let's see.

949
00:37:16,710 --> 00:37:18,170
- I see. This...
- It's his turn now.

950
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:20,480
(The teacher of the day
gets up with excitement.)

951
00:37:21,539 --> 00:37:22,980
Well, everyone.

952
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:24,949
Everyone.

953
00:37:24,949 --> 00:37:26,079
- Everyone.
- Everyone.

954
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,119
(Focused)

955
00:37:27,780 --> 00:37:28,920
(Here's the first thing we'll do.)

956
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,150
For ten minutes...

957
00:37:30,420 --> 00:37:31,550
- "For 10 minutes."
- "For 10 minutes."

958
00:37:32,619 --> 00:37:33,719
you're free.

959
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,289
- "You're free."
- Okay.

960
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:37,190
Break time.

961
00:37:37,230 --> 00:37:38,329
- Right.
- That's right.

962
00:37:38,329 --> 00:37:39,860
- As for classes,
- Yes.

963
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:41,559
they last 50 minutes
and you get a 10-minute break.

964
00:37:41,559 --> 00:37:43,070
They didn't get any breaks in between.

965
00:37:43,070 --> 00:37:44,800
- Right. They didn't get any breaks.
- Yes.

966
00:37:45,099 --> 00:37:46,570
You are free.

967
00:37:46,570 --> 00:37:48,139
- "You are free."
- "You are free."

968
00:37:48,539 --> 00:37:50,239
Okay. It's break time.

969
00:37:50,239 --> 00:37:51,269
(The 7 boy monks
are freely enjoying their break.)

970
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,280
(Spotting something)

971
00:37:55,139 --> 00:37:56,480
They already drew something.

972
00:37:57,449 --> 00:37:58,780
I see. That's the sketchbook.

973
00:37:59,079 --> 00:38:00,150
Students.

974
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:04,050
This is a painting class. Okay?

975
00:38:04,619 --> 00:38:06,059
The teacher is exuding a cool aura.

976
00:38:06,059 --> 00:38:07,789
(The art teacher of the day seems
full of dignity from the start.)

977
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:10,389
(Actually, as for this teacher,)

978
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:12,159
(he's a cartoon artist and a painter
who majored in pure art.)

979
00:38:12,159 --> 00:38:14,360
- He looks sexy when he paints.
- Right.

980
00:38:15,230 --> 00:38:18,500
Take one each.

981
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,000
Is there a key point
about teaching an art class?

982
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:23,809
Art shouldn't be a cliche.

983
00:38:24,510 --> 00:38:27,510
I respect everyone's style.

984
00:38:27,679 --> 00:38:30,250
But if there is a student
who's distracting others,

985
00:38:30,449 --> 00:38:32,679
- then that student must stay out.
- Will you scold him?

986
00:38:32,679 --> 00:38:35,250
It was one of the Buddhist principles
that people shouldn't harm others.

987
00:38:35,250 --> 00:38:37,349
(It's similar to the principle
of living in peace.)

988
00:38:37,349 --> 00:38:38,889
(Comprehending)

989
00:38:39,659 --> 00:38:40,820
Live quietly.

990
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:42,460
- Live quietly.
- Live quietly.

991
00:38:42,730 --> 00:38:43,860
Live peacefully.

992
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,929
(He will hold the art class quietly.)

993
00:38:45,429 --> 00:38:46,800
A pencil.

994
00:38:47,429 --> 00:38:48,599
A pencil, please.

995
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,099
(Tossing)

996
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:52,329
Okay.

997
00:38:52,329 --> 00:38:54,369
(They have a cool
and casual academic tradition.)

998
00:38:54,739 --> 00:38:55,809
Student.

999
00:38:56,769 --> 00:38:58,070
Come here.

1000
00:38:59,139 --> 00:39:00,210
Come here.

1001
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:02,110
Come here.

1002
00:39:02,110 --> 00:39:03,610
It's Monk Bad Boy.

1003
00:39:03,710 --> 00:39:06,519
Today, in our painting class,

1004
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,679
we'll draw faces.

1005
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:10,250
Do you understand? We'll draw faces.

1006
00:39:10,250 --> 00:39:11,690
Will they draw each other's faces?

1007
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,989
All right. Demonstration.

1008
00:39:15,519 --> 00:39:17,059
You sit here.

1009
00:39:17,059 --> 00:39:18,489
He will demonstrate by drawing his face.

1010
00:39:18,489 --> 00:39:20,059
- You wanted to draw him.
- Yes.

1011
00:39:20,329 --> 00:39:23,929
You look here.

1012
00:39:24,630 --> 00:39:26,670
Don't move.

1013
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:27,900
Okay? Understand?

1014
00:39:27,940 --> 00:39:29,840
But there was a problem.

1015
00:39:30,269 --> 00:39:32,210
- When I was drawing to demonstrate,
- Don't move.

1016
00:39:32,210 --> 00:39:33,940
the students couldn't look at him.

1017
00:39:34,340 --> 00:39:35,480
- Right.
- Yes.

1018
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,010
I messed up the class.

1019
00:39:37,010 --> 00:39:39,219
(I messed up the class.)

1020
00:39:39,949 --> 00:39:42,750
I see. Right. They can only see his back.

1021
00:39:43,690 --> 00:39:45,650
Look. Don't move.

1022
00:39:45,650 --> 00:39:46,690
(He demonstrates
without fully grasping the situation.)

1023
00:39:46,690 --> 00:39:47,760
You can't move.

1024
00:39:47,960 --> 00:39:49,019
(Moving)

1025
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:51,130
It's hard for the kids not to move.

1026
00:39:51,429 --> 00:39:53,800
And the students in the back...

1027
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:54,929
- They were bored.
- They lost their focus.

1028
00:39:54,929 --> 00:39:56,230
They couldn't focus well.

1029
00:39:58,769 --> 00:39:59,769
Isn't it tough?

1030
00:40:00,639 --> 00:40:02,539
I'll take a picture and do it.
That might be better for you.

1031
00:40:03,539 --> 00:40:04,869
Look at me.

1032
00:40:05,980 --> 00:40:07,010
Smile.

1033
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,610
(Tightly closed lips)

1034
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:10,449
(Chuckling)

1035
00:40:11,579 --> 00:40:13,420
(Smiling wide)

1036
00:40:13,420 --> 00:40:14,980
- That's nice.
- It feels so nice...

1037
00:40:14,980 --> 00:40:16,619
- to see kids smile.
- Yes.

1038
00:40:16,619 --> 00:40:17,690
Okay.

1039
00:40:17,690 --> 00:40:18,820
(He saves the innocuous smile.)

1040
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,690
Come here. Look.

1041
00:40:21,460 --> 00:40:23,929
(They scuttle across
at the teacher's call.)

1042
00:40:23,929 --> 00:40:25,260
Goodness.

1043
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:26,400
They're gathered around.

1044
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:27,960
- Yes.
- Cute.

1045
00:40:28,329 --> 00:40:30,769
(Quickly)

1046
00:40:30,769 --> 00:40:32,840
Like this with the pencil.

1047
00:40:33,699 --> 00:40:35,869
Don't push. You shouldn't do that.

1048
00:40:36,639 --> 00:40:39,070
Kids like art and physical education.

1049
00:40:39,940 --> 00:40:41,579
(Bumping)

1050
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:44,449
That's it.

1051
00:40:44,449 --> 00:40:45,480
(I want to see too.)

1052
00:40:45,610 --> 00:40:47,449
The youngest can't get a spot.

1053
00:40:47,449 --> 00:40:48,880
- Gosh.
- He's going to cry again.

1054
00:40:49,289 --> 00:40:50,289
Like this.

1055
00:40:50,289 --> 00:40:51,550
(Go over there.)

1056
00:40:53,719 --> 00:40:54,760
(Tap)

1057
00:40:54,760 --> 00:40:56,530
(Give him a spot.)

1058
00:40:56,789 --> 00:40:58,130
Gosh, his charisma.

1059
00:40:58,829 --> 00:41:00,730
The second youngest takes care of
the youngest one.

1060
00:41:00,730 --> 00:41:02,099
Since he might cry.

1061
00:41:03,630 --> 00:41:07,099
(Thanks to him, they all watch together.)

1062
00:41:07,570 --> 00:41:08,570
Here.

1063
00:41:08,570 --> 00:41:09,969
(Let's get to business.)

1064
00:41:11,039 --> 00:41:13,780
You need to check the length and width.

1065
00:41:14,239 --> 00:41:16,250
He seems different.

1066
00:41:16,449 --> 00:41:18,409
He's so different from
when they were doing the times table.

1067
00:41:18,650 --> 00:41:20,280
(So modest)

1068
00:41:20,579 --> 00:41:22,019
Do you get it, monks?

1069
00:41:22,019 --> 00:41:24,289
(Confident)

1070
00:41:24,789 --> 00:41:26,789
- Eraser.
- Eraser.

1071
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:30,659
And then you have to remodel.

1072
00:41:31,559 --> 00:41:32,900
Remodel it.

1073
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,030
(He shows off his artistic talent.)

1074
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:38,199
Watch carefully. You have to do this.

1075
00:41:38,929 --> 00:41:40,400
It's too high quality.

1076
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:41,570
(But, teacher...)

1077
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:43,309
You're going too fast.

1078
00:41:44,239 --> 00:41:45,239
(Close it.)

1079
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:46,280
"Close it."

1080
00:41:46,739 --> 00:41:48,409
A few are breaking away.

1081
00:41:49,380 --> 00:41:52,579
(The youngest gave up long ago.)

1082
00:41:53,050 --> 00:41:55,579
(He doesn't mind his students
turning their backs on him.)

1083
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:58,090
He's in his own world.

1084
00:41:58,090 --> 00:41:59,360
(Art84 is falling into his own world.)

1085
00:41:59,360 --> 00:42:01,590
It became fun for me,
and I realized I was drawing on my own.

1086
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:04,130
Is this too hard for kids?

1087
00:42:04,360 --> 00:42:05,489
He just realized that.

1088
00:42:06,500 --> 00:42:07,760
But if you see here...

1089
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:10,530
- Their ages range from 5 to 18,
- Yes.

1090
00:42:10,829 --> 00:42:13,000
- so I can't target a single age.
- Sure.

1091
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,539
So I just drew what I wanted to draw.

1092
00:42:16,840 --> 00:42:18,110
Since you can't target them all,

1093
00:42:18,110 --> 00:42:19,809
- you didn't target anyone?
- Yes.

1094
00:42:19,809 --> 00:42:22,039
- I will go my own way.
- Yes.

1095
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,050
I will go my own way.

1096
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:25,650
(Art is about going my own way, Kian84)

1097
00:42:26,679 --> 00:42:28,480
(Sticking out his tongue)

1098
00:42:32,320 --> 00:42:33,519
(What?)

1099
00:42:33,519 --> 00:42:34,860
Sure, you can film.

1100
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:37,130
You can be the cameraman.

1101
00:42:37,929 --> 00:42:39,860
- Is Monk Handsome...
- He's filming it.

1102
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,059
Handsome TV.

1103
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:46,300
(The camera is more interesting
than the art.)

1104
00:42:46,300 --> 00:42:47,639
(Just funny)

1105
00:42:48,739 --> 00:42:50,670
(Sticking out his tongue)

1106
00:42:50,670 --> 00:42:52,639
- Kids.
- How cute.

1107
00:42:53,409 --> 00:42:55,340
Here. Like this.

1108
00:42:55,949 --> 00:42:57,280
Observe.

1109
00:42:57,280 --> 00:42:58,710
(The portrait is already finished.)

1110
00:42:58,710 --> 00:42:59,780
Like this.

1111
00:43:00,619 --> 00:43:02,719
- He must love it.
- It's a treasure.

1112
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,320
Here. Now go back to your seats.

1113
00:43:06,719 --> 00:43:08,590
(Look at this.)

1114
00:43:10,059 --> 00:43:12,130
- Gosh.
- It looks the same.

1115
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,699
Kids. Students.

1116
00:43:15,969 --> 00:43:19,639
You should draw me.

1117
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,300
Observe me.

1118
00:43:21,300 --> 00:43:22,739
(Teacher84 decides to be the model.)

1119
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:25,739
I wonder how they will express
Kian84's face.

1120
00:43:25,739 --> 00:43:26,880
- Yes.
- Yes.

1121
00:43:28,210 --> 00:43:31,010
I wonder how they will all be different.

1122
00:43:31,010 --> 00:43:32,050
Yes.

1123
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:35,480
(Sighing)

1124
00:43:35,949 --> 00:43:37,789
(Twitching)

1125
00:43:38,019 --> 00:43:39,789
Draw something funny.

1126
00:43:40,889 --> 00:43:42,789
(Giggling)

1127
00:43:43,289 --> 00:43:46,260
(The teacher's face is funny.)

1128
00:43:47,500 --> 00:43:49,369
Okay. Draw comfortably.

1129
00:43:49,369 --> 00:43:50,829
Just have fun.

1130
00:43:51,530 --> 00:43:54,099
Having fun is
the most important thing, kids.

1131
00:43:54,099 --> 00:43:55,440
- He's right.
- Yes.

1132
00:43:55,769 --> 00:43:57,170
Interesting.

1133
00:43:57,809 --> 00:43:59,010
Important.

1134
00:43:59,210 --> 00:44:00,780
(Gosh, advanced English.)

1135
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:04,650
Something amusing. You can't force it.

1136
00:44:06,550 --> 00:44:08,079
Don't force your life.

1137
00:44:08,420 --> 00:44:09,750
Have fun.

1138
00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:13,320
I've realized that's what life is.

1139
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:16,460
(That's what life is.)

1140
00:44:16,460 --> 00:44:18,090
Don't do something if you don't want to.

1141
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:20,300
He's saying it from the heart.

1142
00:44:20,400 --> 00:44:21,829
It's a good lesson.

1143
00:44:21,829 --> 00:44:23,170
(The true teacher gives them
life lessons as well.)

1144
00:44:25,130 --> 00:44:26,300
(What?)

1145
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,400
What is it?

1146
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:28,840
Gosh, I saw it.

1147
00:44:29,969 --> 00:44:31,710
I told them to draw my face,

1148
00:44:33,239 --> 00:44:35,280
but they aren't locked in
when it comes to art styles.

1149
00:44:35,880 --> 00:44:37,780
- They are free.
- Don't be locked in.

1150
00:44:37,780 --> 00:44:39,820
(It beats Picasso's cubism.)

1151
00:44:40,550 --> 00:44:41,619
I love it.

1152
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:45,949
I don't even need to be the model.

1153
00:44:47,019 --> 00:44:49,119
They're not even looking at him.

1154
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:52,590
They're drawing from memory.

1155
00:44:53,659 --> 00:44:54,800
Life.

1156
00:44:55,559 --> 00:44:56,730
Important.

1157
00:44:56,730 --> 00:44:57,929
(The teacher says what he wants to.)

1158
00:44:58,199 --> 00:44:59,400
Interesting.

1159
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:00,969
(The class is so interesting.)

1160
00:45:02,369 --> 00:45:04,139
No fighting.

1161
00:45:04,139 --> 00:45:05,269
This is classtime, right?

1162
00:45:05,739 --> 00:45:07,409
(He did not give up on the class.)

1163
00:45:07,409 --> 00:45:09,510
- He looks like a pretty beggar.
- Gosh.

1164
00:45:09,510 --> 00:45:10,780
You're going to get some memes.

1165
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:14,579
- Finished.
- Finished.

1166
00:45:14,820 --> 00:45:15,820
Okay.

1167
00:45:15,820 --> 00:45:18,090
(He finished before the teacher
could lie down any more.)

1168
00:45:18,550 --> 00:45:19,889
Look at this free artistic style.

1169
00:45:19,889 --> 00:45:21,320
(Title - Free Teacher,
Artist - Monk Nightmare)

1170
00:45:21,320 --> 00:45:23,630
You drew my thinning hair well.

1171
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,260
He was able to express his hair as well.

1172
00:45:25,260 --> 00:45:26,929
He got his lips right.

1173
00:45:26,929 --> 00:45:28,300
(The frowning lips are exact.)

1174
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:30,000
Excellent!

1175
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:31,869
Okay.

1176
00:45:32,469 --> 00:45:34,000
(Look at mine too.)

1177
00:45:34,400 --> 00:45:36,639
Okay. It's me.

1178
00:45:36,639 --> 00:45:38,539
(Monk Bad Boy also
proudly shows his work.)

1179
00:45:39,710 --> 00:45:42,010
This is so playful.

1180
00:45:42,010 --> 00:45:43,079
Excellent.

1181
00:45:43,579 --> 00:45:45,150
- He did well.
- He got a compliment.

1182
00:45:45,150 --> 00:45:46,179
Next up.

1183
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:48,219
The oldest.

1184
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:51,550
- Big brother.
- He kept laughing.

1185
00:45:51,550 --> 00:45:52,820
He was giggling.

1186
00:45:53,289 --> 00:45:56,489
(Laughing)

1187
00:45:57,429 --> 00:45:59,030
(Shy)

1188
00:45:59,900 --> 00:46:01,429
(His works gives them a laugh.)

1189
00:46:01,429 --> 00:46:02,869
Gosh, is this some master artisan?

1190
00:46:02,869 --> 00:46:04,269
(Title - The Teacher with Good Teeth,
Artist - Monk Oldest)

1191
00:46:04,269 --> 00:46:07,139
He drew my teeth like prison iron bars.

1192
00:46:08,139 --> 00:46:10,570
- He observed you well.
- You can see the depth.

1193
00:46:11,309 --> 00:46:12,510
(The oldest one's work has humor.)

1194
00:46:12,510 --> 00:46:14,079
This is a bit scary.

1195
00:46:14,309 --> 00:46:15,409
Excellent.

1196
00:46:16,949 --> 00:46:19,150
The kids were happy...

1197
00:46:19,619 --> 00:46:21,380
and focused while drawing.

1198
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:24,019
And Monk Saliva...

1199
00:46:24,719 --> 00:46:26,289
drew something else, not me.

1200
00:46:26,860 --> 00:46:28,860
He drew what he wanted to,

1201
00:46:29,389 --> 00:46:30,860
and that is his art style.

1202
00:46:31,559 --> 00:46:33,630
Yes, famous artists have their own style.

1203
00:46:33,630 --> 00:46:35,730
- Yes.
- They don't just draw what's there.

1204
00:46:36,429 --> 00:46:40,099
Since they had fun, I thought it was nice.

1205
00:46:40,099 --> 00:46:41,639
(It was nice that they got to have fun.)

1206
00:46:42,340 --> 00:46:44,510
When I teach kids at cram schools,

1207
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:47,880
I give monotonous rules,

1208
00:46:47,880 --> 00:46:49,650
with set guidelines,

1209
00:46:50,579 --> 00:46:52,710
but I didn't do that here.

1210
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:53,949
(I didn't do that with the 7 monks.)

1211
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:56,219
"Do as you like."

1212
00:46:57,989 --> 00:46:59,119
There's no right answer.

1213
00:47:01,289 --> 00:47:05,230
They said that their dreams
were to become monks.

1214
00:47:05,230 --> 00:47:06,260
Yes.

1215
00:47:06,260 --> 00:47:07,599
But I still want them to be open.

1216
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:10,269
They could become mathematicians, or...

1217
00:47:10,269 --> 00:47:11,429
- Yes.
- Sure.

1218
00:47:11,429 --> 00:47:13,340
They are at the age
when they can take it all in.

1219
00:47:13,340 --> 00:47:16,099
We don't know how they will change
as they grow up,

1220
00:47:16,340 --> 00:47:19,139
so I wanted them to learn
different things.

1221
00:47:19,139 --> 00:47:20,940
- Yes.
- I hope they get more chances.

1222
00:47:20,940 --> 00:47:21,980
Yes.

1223
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:24,480
Your freedom...

1224
00:47:25,309 --> 00:47:27,349
Everyone's freedom.

1225
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:30,489
Today's class is finished.

1226
00:47:30,489 --> 00:47:31,619
(The class ends with his wish that
they grow freely.)

1227
00:47:32,389 --> 00:47:34,260
Let's take a picture, guys.

1228
00:47:34,260 --> 00:47:35,289
Photo?

1229
00:47:35,389 --> 00:47:37,389
- The camera Pani Bottle gave you?
- I'll take your picture.

1230
00:47:37,889 --> 00:47:39,360
Gather around.

1231
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,429
Here.

1232
00:47:41,429 --> 00:47:43,230
They must be amazed.

1233
00:47:43,900 --> 00:47:45,230
(Watching)

1234
00:47:45,599 --> 00:47:46,739
Hey, come here.

1235
00:47:47,369 --> 00:47:48,969
You didn't wash your face, did you? Come.

1236
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:52,639
You need to wash your face before class,

1237
00:47:52,639 --> 00:47:54,039
not after class.

1238
00:47:54,039 --> 00:47:55,579
He's so sweet.

1239
00:47:55,579 --> 00:47:57,409
You didn't even get to wash your own face.

1240
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:00,750
He will wash the kids' faces,
even if he didn't get to wash his own.

1241
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:02,449
(He wipes it carefully
as if he's his son.)

1242
00:48:02,449 --> 00:48:04,489
- He must feel like your son.
- He did.

1243
00:48:04,849 --> 00:48:06,690
You will be a great dad.

1244
00:48:07,320 --> 00:48:08,360
Okay.

1245
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:11,130
Handsome.

1246
00:48:11,559 --> 00:48:12,659
Handsome guy.

1247
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:13,960
Gosh.
(Shining)

1248
00:48:15,230 --> 00:48:16,929
Why is your face so chapped?

1249
00:48:17,630 --> 00:48:19,130
- They are at a high altitude,
- It's too cold.

1250
00:48:19,130 --> 00:48:20,940
so it is very dry and cold.

1251
00:48:21,570 --> 00:48:22,869
Nose, forehead.

1252
00:48:23,710 --> 00:48:25,170
Cheeks.

1253
00:48:25,170 --> 00:48:26,210
Goodness.

1254
00:48:26,710 --> 00:48:28,880
- It's like when he put ointment on Dex.
- Yes.

1255
00:48:28,880 --> 00:48:30,050
That's right.

1256
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:33,050
Chin.

1257
00:48:33,050 --> 00:48:34,380
(Rub it on.)

1258
00:48:35,619 --> 00:48:37,349
- That's it.
- Gosh.

1259
00:48:37,550 --> 00:48:38,750
How cute.

1260
00:48:39,489 --> 00:48:41,219
- He's so cute.
- He's so cute.

1261
00:48:42,260 --> 00:48:43,489
Cleanly.

1262
00:48:43,889 --> 00:48:45,059
Okay.

1263
00:48:45,829 --> 00:48:46,929
Okay.

1264
00:48:47,800 --> 00:48:50,400
On 1, 2, 3.

1265
00:48:51,269 --> 00:48:52,269
Okay.

1266
00:48:52,829 --> 00:48:54,570
Monk Handsome's pose is...

1267
00:48:54,570 --> 00:48:56,769
Yes. He has swag.

1268
00:48:57,739 --> 00:48:58,869
(Watching)

1269
00:48:58,869 --> 00:48:59,909
Okay.

1270
00:49:00,610 --> 00:49:02,210
- Here.
- Gosh.

1271
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:03,510
It must be so cool.

1272
00:49:03,949 --> 00:49:05,909
- It's coming out right away.
- Yes.

1273
00:49:06,679 --> 00:49:08,250
It's finished.

1274
00:49:09,519 --> 00:49:11,250
(A piece of their memory
will be kept in their classroom.)

1275
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:12,489
Hang it up in the room.

1276
00:49:12,489 --> 00:49:15,820
- It feels so warm.
- Good times.

1277
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:19,460
Monks, let's rest now.

1278
00:49:21,460 --> 00:49:22,800
Let's go for a walk.

1279
00:49:24,030 --> 00:49:26,340
(They go somewhere for a walk.)

1280
00:49:27,139 --> 00:49:28,300
Hi.

1281
00:49:28,300 --> 00:49:30,070
Hi, hello. Say hello.

1282
00:49:30,369 --> 00:49:32,610
(They walk nicely in line...)

1283
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:34,010
(to a picturesque scenery.)

1284
00:49:34,010 --> 00:49:35,079
What is that?

1285
00:49:36,139 --> 00:49:38,809
That is the Tso Moriri lake.

1286
00:49:39,349 --> 00:49:42,250
This is a salt lake
located 4,520m above sea level,

1287
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:44,119
close to the sky,

1288
00:49:44,119 --> 00:49:46,789
and the wetland
and plateau formed nearby...

1289
00:49:46,789 --> 00:49:49,690
are home to wild animals and rare birds.

1290
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:53,030
The shadows of the clouds
that reflect on the lake...

1291
00:49:53,030 --> 00:49:55,630
and the different colors made from
the different depths are...

1292
00:49:55,630 --> 00:49:58,699
the biggest characteristics of
Tso Moriri Lake.

1293
00:49:58,699 --> 00:50:01,400
(The beauty of Mother Nature
shown by Tso Moriri Lake)

1294
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:04,010
Water stones?

1295
00:50:04,010 --> 00:50:05,039
"Water stones?"

1296
00:50:05,039 --> 00:50:06,579
- Skipping stones?
- Skipping stones?

1297
00:50:06,579 --> 00:50:07,809
Water stones?

1298
00:50:08,539 --> 00:50:09,539
Watch.

1299
00:50:09,880 --> 00:50:10,880
Water.

1300
00:50:11,110 --> 00:50:13,880
(He confidently shows them.)

1301
00:50:15,219 --> 00:50:16,989
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1302
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:18,289
It worked.

1303
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,559
(Glancing)

1304
00:50:21,059 --> 00:50:22,119
Did you see that?

1305
00:50:23,829 --> 00:50:27,000
(The boy monks try as well.)

1306
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:30,869
Who was that?

1307
00:50:30,869 --> 00:50:32,269
The boy monk did better.

1308
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:36,940
This pin stone.

1309
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:40,880
Pin stone and snap.

1310
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:41,980
(He teaches them,
without noticing the skilled boy.)

1311
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:43,349
My turn.

1312
00:50:44,480 --> 00:50:45,550
My turn.

1313
00:50:48,849 --> 00:50:50,119
(He is also skilled.)

1314
00:50:50,119 --> 00:50:51,250
Gosh, they're good.

1315
00:50:51,250 --> 00:50:52,920
They must do this every day.

1316
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:55,920
Gosh! Good.

1317
00:50:56,489 --> 00:50:58,690
(Actually, while Kian84
was demonstrating...)

1318
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:02,059
He only got a few. I'm better.

1319
00:51:02,059 --> 00:51:03,099
What?

1320
00:51:03,500 --> 00:51:04,670
(They live by the lake.)

1321
00:51:04,670 --> 00:51:06,500
They live by the lake.

1322
00:51:07,170 --> 00:51:08,570
They already know how to do it.

1323
00:51:09,139 --> 00:51:10,610
Tilt up a bit more.

1324
00:51:10,610 --> 00:51:12,440
A bit more. Okay.

1325
00:51:12,469 --> 00:51:14,210
What is that meaningless guidance?

1326
00:51:14,210 --> 00:51:15,340
Last shot.

1327
00:51:15,639 --> 00:51:16,780
(There is no end to skipping stones!)

1328
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:18,980
- He is still the teacher for the day.
- How funny.

1329
00:51:19,409 --> 00:51:20,519
Let's go.

1330
00:51:21,349 --> 00:51:23,320
We will go and play.

1331
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:25,019
- Yes!
- Go.

1332
00:51:25,889 --> 00:51:28,219
They did so well, so I lost interest.

1333
00:51:29,690 --> 00:51:32,230
I wanted to play soccer
if they had a ball,

1334
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:34,000
but I couldn't find one.

1335
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,260
I think they have a cracket ball.

1336
00:51:36,260 --> 00:51:37,329
Cricket.

1337
00:51:37,400 --> 00:51:38,429
I will try that.

1338
00:51:38,829 --> 00:51:40,139
Is it physical education class now?

1339
00:51:40,139 --> 00:51:41,139
(4th period, Outdoor activity)

1340
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,469
Cricket is the top sport in India.

1341
00:51:43,469 --> 00:51:44,670
That was my first time playing.

1342
00:51:45,539 --> 00:51:48,440
Cricket is a ball game where two sides...

1343
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:50,480
with 11 team members each
on offense and defense...

1344
00:51:50,480 --> 00:51:53,480
compete by hitting the ball with a bat.

1345
00:51:53,579 --> 00:51:55,780
It can easily be seen played in India,

1346
00:51:55,780 --> 00:51:58,690
since it is a popular sport nationwide.

1347
00:51:59,489 --> 00:52:02,760
Let's play cricket, students.

1348
00:52:03,329 --> 00:52:05,389
Tell me the rules. Play, the rules.

1349
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:07,360
"Play with the rules."

1350
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:10,070
You have to go to the other team.

1351
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:12,070
- You're on my team?
- Yes.

1352
00:52:12,070 --> 00:52:13,099
Okay.

1353
00:52:13,869 --> 00:52:16,239
(Come here.)

1354
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:19,039
What? Why are you choosing the teams?

1355
00:52:19,840 --> 00:52:21,579
Don't you do "up or down?"

1356
00:52:22,710 --> 00:52:24,010
Don't you do "up or down?"

1357
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,679
He is the younger teacher.

1358
00:52:25,949 --> 00:52:27,719
Okay, the rules.

1359
00:52:28,019 --> 00:52:29,889
You hit and run.

1360
00:52:29,889 --> 00:52:31,920
Okay. Go and play.

1361
00:52:32,389 --> 00:52:34,360
- It's similar to baseball, isn't it?
- Yes, it is.

1362
00:52:35,159 --> 00:52:36,659
I will learn as I play.

1363
00:52:39,329 --> 00:52:42,730
(In the vast expanse of nature,)

1364
00:52:42,730 --> 00:52:45,030
(with just a stick and a ball,)

1365
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:48,500
(the 7 boys run happily.)

1366
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:51,510
It's as big as his own body.

1367
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:53,809
How cute.

1368
00:52:54,940 --> 00:52:56,110
Let's hit a home run.

1369
00:52:58,679 --> 00:53:00,880
(He misses the ball.)

1370
00:53:01,780 --> 00:53:03,050
(Pouting)

1371
00:53:03,050 --> 00:53:04,289
How cute.

1372
00:53:04,849 --> 00:53:07,019
Good job.

1373
00:53:08,019 --> 00:53:09,760
You won in terms of content.

1374
00:53:12,329 --> 00:53:13,760
(Swinging hard)

1375
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:16,130
(Gosh, I missed.)

1376
00:53:16,429 --> 00:53:17,500
(I will go.)

1377
00:53:17,500 --> 00:53:19,170
Gosh, he's flying.

1378
00:53:20,869 --> 00:53:22,840
(I caught it.)

1379
00:53:24,269 --> 00:53:25,539
(Still, they hold hands
like good friends.)

1380
00:53:25,539 --> 00:53:26,739
How cute.

1381
00:53:27,210 --> 00:53:29,880
(You wouldn't believe that they are
4,520m above sea level...)

1382
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,280
(from the 7 boys' stamina.)

1383
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:32,280
Nice!

1384
00:53:33,050 --> 00:53:34,150
Gosh.

1385
00:53:34,380 --> 00:53:36,079
Oh right, they are high up.

1386
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:37,849
- They're flying.
- Don't they get out of breath?

1387
00:53:37,849 --> 00:53:40,519
If they come to Korea,

1388
00:53:40,519 --> 00:53:42,289
they need to be sent to
the Korea National Training Center.

1389
00:53:42,289 --> 00:53:44,230
(They need to be sent to
the Korea National Training Center.)

1390
00:53:45,360 --> 00:53:46,489
You're good.

1391
00:53:47,900 --> 00:53:50,369
(They don't have a proper cricket field,)

1392
00:53:50,369 --> 00:53:51,699
You're hitting them all.

1393
00:53:51,699 --> 00:53:54,000
(but the 7 boys enjoy it well.)

1394
00:53:54,139 --> 00:53:56,809
They're having so much fun.

1395
00:53:57,039 --> 00:53:58,070
With just this?

1396
00:53:58,809 --> 00:54:00,409
They're having so much fun.

1397
00:54:00,409 --> 00:54:02,010
(Giggling)

1398
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:04,349
- You come.
- Okay.

1399
00:54:05,050 --> 00:54:07,880
(It is finally Kim's turn.)

1400
00:54:08,420 --> 00:54:10,320
(Good luck, Kim!)

1401
00:54:11,650 --> 00:54:13,619
(Checking the wind)

1402
00:54:14,090 --> 00:54:16,090
(A fastball towards Kim)

1403
00:54:16,829 --> 00:54:19,090
(Jumping)

1404
00:54:19,690 --> 00:54:21,030
I thought you were dancing.

1405
00:54:21,630 --> 00:54:23,599
(Laughing)

1406
00:54:24,099 --> 00:54:27,599
(The 2nd ball)

1407
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:29,570
(It's also a miss.)

1408
00:54:29,869 --> 00:54:30,909
(You can do it, Kim!)

1409
00:54:30,909 --> 00:54:32,510
- Gosh.
- It's not easy.

1410
00:54:33,340 --> 00:54:35,710
(Changing his mind)

1411
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:38,380
Your posture is...

1412
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:43,820
(Will he be able to hit is this time?)

1413
00:54:44,389 --> 00:54:46,889
(He hit it.)

1414
00:54:46,960 --> 00:54:48,059
He hit it.

1415
00:54:48,059 --> 00:54:49,090
(Looking blank)

1416
00:54:49,519 --> 00:54:52,190
- Run!
- Run!

1417
00:54:52,190 --> 00:54:53,190
- You have to run.
- Run!

1418
00:54:53,260 --> 00:54:54,500
- Run!
- Run!

1419
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:56,730
- Gosh.
- A frilled lizard.

1420
00:54:57,869 --> 00:54:59,900
(He runs quickly.)

1421
00:55:00,269 --> 00:55:01,570
(Swish)

1422
00:55:02,239 --> 00:55:03,840
It's hard to run after the hit.

1423
00:55:04,340 --> 00:55:06,010
This is one point.

1424
00:55:06,010 --> 00:55:07,940
Oh, but at least you got it.

1425
00:55:07,940 --> 00:55:09,880
(He got a point with all his might.)

1426
00:55:09,980 --> 00:55:11,909
(Are you tired?)

1427
00:55:12,050 --> 00:55:13,880
(Panting)

1428
00:55:15,150 --> 00:55:16,179
Kim.

1429
00:55:16,349 --> 00:55:17,849
You need to throw the ball slowly.

1430
00:55:19,320 --> 00:55:22,119
(Monk Saliva advises
to throw the ball slowly.)

1431
00:55:23,730 --> 00:55:27,329
(He keeps going.)

1432
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:29,659
(Gosh)

1433
00:55:30,500 --> 00:55:33,699
You shouldn't throw like that.

1434
00:55:34,170 --> 00:55:35,940
(Hold the ball...)

1435
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,340
(and throw slowly.)

1436
00:55:37,510 --> 00:55:39,570
(Monk Saliva is the top instructor.)

1437
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:41,579
Kim.

1438
00:55:42,010 --> 00:55:43,010
Like this.

1439
00:55:43,280 --> 00:55:44,809
- Okay.
- Like this.

1440
00:55:45,849 --> 00:55:47,849
No!

1441
00:55:47,849 --> 00:55:49,449
Okay.

1442
00:55:49,949 --> 00:55:51,150
Cricket style?

1443
00:55:51,519 --> 00:55:54,760
(He spins it, cricket style.)

1444
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,460
(Rolling)

1445
00:55:57,130 --> 00:55:58,360
Oh, good.

1446
00:55:58,559 --> 00:56:00,030
Good.

1447
00:56:00,500 --> 00:56:01,599
How cute.

1448
00:56:02,360 --> 00:56:03,469
(Under the picturesque scenery...)

1449
00:56:03,469 --> 00:56:04,500
Nice.

1450
00:56:04,500 --> 00:56:06,000
(given by mother nature,)

1451
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:07,800
(the 7 boy monks and Kian84...)

1452
00:56:07,800 --> 00:56:10,070
Gosh, home run.

1453
00:56:10,070 --> 00:56:11,210
(just have fun playing.)

1454
00:56:11,639 --> 00:56:12,840
It must be so hard...

1455
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,110
just to move around there.

1456
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:16,909
I was actually really tired,

1457
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:18,409
and I couldn't breathe,

1458
00:56:18,809 --> 00:56:20,349
but I realized that...

1459
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:23,079
my mind was reset a bit.
I'm thankful for that.

1460
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,590
It's hard to spend an hour...

1461
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:27,360
without our smartphones,

1462
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:29,690
but they had so much fun.

1463
00:56:30,159 --> 00:56:33,500
I was thankful to be able to...

1464
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:35,130
spend time with them like that.

1465
00:56:35,260 --> 00:56:38,000
I was grateful for that.

1466
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:39,030
(He is thankful for
the 7 boy monks' pureness.)

1467
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:41,500
Monk. For the next game,

1468
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:43,369
let's play a Korean game.

1469
00:56:43,369 --> 00:56:44,739
You're going to teach them?

1470
00:56:44,739 --> 00:56:47,679
"Green light, red light."

1471
00:56:48,210 --> 00:56:51,010
That's a good idea,
since you don't need any tools.

1472
00:56:51,010 --> 00:56:53,519
There were no computers or phones,

1473
00:56:53,519 --> 00:56:56,250
so they always played like that.

1474
00:56:56,250 --> 00:56:59,190
And it became really famous
thanks to "Squid Game."

1475
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:01,420
But those kids don't know
"Squid Game" either.

1476
00:57:01,420 --> 00:57:04,190
- Yes, since they don't have Netflix.
- They don't have Netflix.

1477
00:57:04,190 --> 00:57:06,289
- They know now, thanks to you.
- Yes.

1478
00:57:06,659 --> 00:57:10,469
When I say, "Green light, red light,"

1479
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:13,230
you guys...

1480
00:57:13,269 --> 00:57:14,539
- Come towards me.
- Yes.

1481
00:57:14,539 --> 00:57:15,739
(Like this.)

1482
00:57:15,739 --> 00:57:18,170
Follow me.

1483
00:57:18,170 --> 00:57:19,539
They're watching so alertly.

1484
00:57:19,539 --> 00:57:22,210
- They're looking so curiously.
- Yes.

1485
00:57:22,210 --> 00:57:23,710
Touch my back...

1486
00:57:24,010 --> 00:57:26,150
and then return.

1487
00:57:26,710 --> 00:57:28,019
Return and...

1488
00:57:29,519 --> 00:57:31,920
Until here.

1489
00:57:31,989 --> 00:57:34,559
Come here.

1490
00:57:34,659 --> 00:57:36,619
They will catch on soon enough
once they play it.

1491
00:57:36,719 --> 00:57:37,889
You need to try it for yourself.

1492
00:57:38,789 --> 00:57:39,829
Here I go.

1493
00:57:39,829 --> 00:57:41,260
Yes!

1494
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:43,599
Will they understand?

1495
00:57:43,599 --> 00:57:45,329
(As soon as he turns back...)

1496
00:57:45,329 --> 00:57:47,840
Green light...

1497
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:50,039
(Scurrying around)

1498
00:57:50,039 --> 00:57:51,039
red light.

1499
00:57:52,110 --> 00:57:53,139
(Moving)

1500
00:57:53,139 --> 00:57:54,739
- How cute.
- I'll let this slide.

1501
00:57:55,010 --> 00:57:56,079
One more.

1502
00:57:57,179 --> 00:57:59,150
Green light, red light.

1503
00:57:59,449 --> 00:58:01,179
(Staggering)

1504
00:58:01,920 --> 00:58:02,980
Come here.

1505
00:58:03,619 --> 00:58:04,920
Come here, all of you.

1506
00:58:05,590 --> 00:58:06,650
Hold my hand.

1507
00:58:07,489 --> 00:58:09,719
The oldest one. Monk Saliva

1508
00:58:10,059 --> 00:58:11,329
Monk Saliva, come here.

1509
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:12,590
(I don't want to go.)

1510
00:58:12,590 --> 00:58:13,960
I'll let you go, Monk Saliva.

1511
00:58:15,030 --> 00:58:17,570
Green light, red light.

1512
00:58:18,269 --> 00:58:19,500
(Impressed)

1513
00:58:20,269 --> 00:58:21,969
(Freeze)

1514
00:58:22,500 --> 00:58:23,639
- They got it now.
- Yes.

1515
00:58:23,639 --> 00:58:25,440
(Completely frozen)

1516
00:58:25,670 --> 00:58:26,769
You have to cut it.

1517
00:58:32,349 --> 00:58:34,150
That's so new.

1518
00:58:34,150 --> 00:58:35,650
He cut it after making eye contact.

1519
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:39,949
(He just goes with it,
since he was polite.)

1520
00:58:40,150 --> 00:58:41,719
(Hey!)

1521
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,730
I got you.

1522
00:58:44,730 --> 00:58:46,030
(Crying Monk got caught.)

1523
00:58:47,199 --> 00:58:49,260
- Okay.
- But this was bad.

1524
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:50,599
Why?

1525
00:58:51,329 --> 00:58:52,869
Why? Are you crying?

1526
00:58:52,969 --> 00:58:54,440
I'm sorry.

1527
00:58:54,440 --> 00:58:55,500
No. Okay.

1528
00:58:55,639 --> 00:58:57,210
(Are you crying?)

1529
00:58:57,610 --> 00:58:58,869
(I'm sorry.)

1530
00:58:58,869 --> 00:59:01,010
(Okay, I'm sorry.)

1531
00:59:01,239 --> 00:59:03,079
I'm sorry.

1532
00:59:03,079 --> 00:59:04,110
(Why only catch me?)

1533
00:59:04,110 --> 00:59:05,280
I felt really bad.

1534
00:59:05,280 --> 00:59:07,119
I'm sorry. Forgive me.

1535
00:59:07,119 --> 00:59:08,820
(Forgive me.)

1536
00:59:08,820 --> 00:59:09,949
Okay. I'm sorry.

1537
00:59:11,650 --> 00:59:12,920
It's okay.

1538
00:59:13,389 --> 00:59:14,389
It's okay.

1539
00:59:14,389 --> 00:59:15,760
I'll be the tagger.

1540
00:59:16,760 --> 00:59:18,190
He cried really hard.

1541
00:59:18,429 --> 00:59:19,630
How adorable.

1542
00:59:20,260 --> 00:59:21,360
One more game.

1543
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:22,429
(Round 2 with Kian84 as the tagger)

1544
00:59:23,159 --> 00:59:25,329
Green light, red light.

1545
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:26,369
(Ta-da)

1546
00:59:26,369 --> 00:59:28,039
They're used to it now.

1547
00:59:28,039 --> 00:59:29,239
Green light, red light.

1548
00:59:29,239 --> 00:59:30,309
(Speeding up)

1549
00:59:31,010 --> 00:59:33,739
(In just 2 rounds,
the 7 boy monks got the hang of it.)

1550
00:59:33,739 --> 00:59:34,739
They're good.

1551
00:59:35,780 --> 00:59:37,880
- He's cute.
- How cute.

1552
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:39,409
Green light, red light.

1553
00:59:40,050 --> 00:59:41,250
(Flinch)

1554
00:59:41,480 --> 00:59:42,579
Come here.

1555
00:59:42,750 --> 00:59:43,750
(Feigning innocence)

1556
00:59:43,750 --> 00:59:44,989
- He's not looking.
- Come here.

1557
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:47,019
You already had your finger out.

1558
00:59:47,590 --> 00:59:48,590
(Laughing)

1559
00:59:48,590 --> 00:59:49,960
He's in a better mood.

1560
00:59:51,230 --> 00:59:52,489
(Standing face to face)

1561
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:53,559
Green light...

1562
00:59:53,829 --> 00:59:55,829
He has to choose someone else,
or they will cry.

1563
00:59:57,469 --> 00:59:58,570
(Screaming)

1564
00:59:58,570 --> 01:00:00,400
(Laughing)

1565
01:00:01,139 --> 01:00:02,239
Monk Saliva.

1566
01:00:02,369 --> 01:00:04,739
You're the tagger, Monk Saliva.

1567
01:00:06,869 --> 01:00:08,909
(Monk Saliva is refusing
to be the tagger.)

1568
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:10,409
Be the tagger instead.

1569
01:00:11,179 --> 01:00:13,079
Gosh, the big brother is being nice.

1570
01:00:13,380 --> 01:00:15,449
Green light, red light.

1571
01:00:15,650 --> 01:00:17,289
(Clearly)

1572
01:00:17,889 --> 01:00:20,090
(His Korean pronunciation is top-notch.)

1573
01:00:20,090 --> 01:00:21,590
Green light, red light.

1574
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,130
I saw you. Come here.

1575
01:00:24,489 --> 01:00:25,559
Here.

1576
01:00:26,460 --> 01:00:28,000
(Startled)

1577
01:00:28,630 --> 01:00:30,230
Green light, red light.

1578
01:00:32,329 --> 01:00:33,500
Come here.

1579
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,239
- They got the rules down.
- They're fast learners.

1580
01:00:36,239 --> 01:00:37,440
They improved in no time.

1581
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:39,010
(The game difficulty shot up.)

1582
01:00:39,239 --> 01:00:40,840
Green light, red light.

1583
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:42,840
(The link has been cut!)

1584
01:00:43,639 --> 01:00:44,780
Who will he catch?

1585
01:00:45,349 --> 01:00:48,380
(He catches Monk Handsome
without hesitation.)

1586
01:00:48,750 --> 01:00:51,119
(Laughing)

1587
01:00:52,090 --> 01:00:55,889
(Laughing)

1588
01:00:56,690 --> 01:00:58,059
(It's not easy at 4,520m above sea level.)

1589
01:00:58,059 --> 01:00:59,559
It's tiresome.

1590
01:01:00,860 --> 01:01:02,429
Guys, let's go to the lakeside.

1591
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:04,469
Green light, red light.

1592
01:01:04,469 --> 01:01:05,530
It must've been fun.

1593
01:01:07,070 --> 01:01:08,500
One more? Last round? Okay.

1594
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:10,940
Green light, red light.

1595
01:01:11,639 --> 01:01:13,309
Green light, red light.

1596
01:01:13,309 --> 01:01:14,309
(Yes!)

1597
01:01:14,980 --> 01:01:17,449
- They'll continue to play this game.
- Right?

1598
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:20,050
(The one-day teacher is quite worn out.)

1599
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:21,679
Green light, red light.

1600
01:01:21,679 --> 01:01:23,989
(But looking at the kids having fun,)

1601
01:01:23,989 --> 01:01:25,289
(he gives his all.)

1602
01:01:25,820 --> 01:01:28,489
- Green light, red light.
- It's such a pretty scene.

1603
01:01:28,489 --> 01:01:29,489
I agree.

1604
01:01:29,489 --> 01:01:30,730
(A picturesque scene is being painted.)

1605
01:01:31,530 --> 01:01:33,360
Is the last round over?

1606
01:01:33,659 --> 01:01:34,659
(No.)

1607
01:01:34,659 --> 01:01:36,699
- Oh, no.
- Green light, red light.

1608
01:01:36,699 --> 01:01:38,000
This is bad.

1609
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:40,099
The kids liked it.

1610
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,769
It was beyond my imagination.

1611
01:01:42,099 --> 01:01:43,840
They say it even now as they pass by.

1612
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,409
"Green light, red light."

1613
01:01:45,610 --> 01:01:46,739
And they pass by.

1614
01:01:46,969 --> 01:01:48,110
(Even during the interview)

1615
01:01:48,110 --> 01:01:49,909
Green light, red light.

1616
01:01:51,150 --> 01:01:53,949
Green light, red light.

1617
01:01:53,949 --> 01:01:55,380
- My gosh. Even then?
- Great.

1618
01:01:55,650 --> 01:01:56,920
Excellent.

1619
01:01:57,920 --> 01:01:59,420
Excellent.

1620
01:01:59,420 --> 01:02:01,760
Green light, red light.

1621
01:02:02,590 --> 01:02:03,860
Even if I leave,

1622
01:02:03,860 --> 01:02:05,730
I bet they'll continue playing this game.

1623
01:02:05,730 --> 01:02:07,300
I feel proud for some reason.

1624
01:02:08,030 --> 01:02:09,300
- Green light, red light.
- It's strange.

1625
01:02:09,300 --> 01:02:10,570
- I'm getting emotional.
- Right?

1626
01:02:10,929 --> 01:02:13,769
(It's a special experience
all of them will remember.)

1627
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,869
Students, we'll go to the lake.

1628
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:20,039
We'll go to the lake.

1629
01:02:20,710 --> 01:02:22,179
Let's go after washing our hands.

1630
01:02:23,039 --> 01:02:24,710
Play it later by yourselves.
It's fun, right?

1631
01:02:27,280 --> 01:02:30,019
Go. Come back, son. Wash your hands.

1632
01:02:30,650 --> 01:02:32,119
(The 7 boy monks wash their hands
at the picturesque lake.)

1633
01:02:32,119 --> 01:02:34,460
- That's crazy.
- Gosh, it's gorgeous.

1634
01:02:34,460 --> 01:02:35,860
The lake is like a painting.

1635
01:02:38,590 --> 01:02:40,260
(Washing thoroughly)

1636
01:02:41,030 --> 01:02:42,059
Good.

1637
01:02:42,059 --> 01:02:43,900
(All the classes are over.)

1638
01:02:43,900 --> 01:02:44,969
Come back.

1639
01:02:45,769 --> 01:02:46,869
Here.

1640
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:48,639
The blankets.

1641
01:02:49,139 --> 01:02:50,400
Are you going to bed?

1642
01:02:51,409 --> 01:02:53,039
(They take the blankets...)

1643
01:02:53,039 --> 01:02:54,079
Go.

1644
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:55,340
(and go outside?)

1645
01:02:56,239 --> 01:02:58,650
(The one-day teacher takes the lead.)

1646
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:03,079
(The 7 boy monks follow him
with blankets as big as them.)

1647
01:03:06,750 --> 01:03:08,460
(Breathing heavily)

1648
01:03:08,920 --> 01:03:11,889
To be honest,
I was dying to dust off the blankets.

1649
01:03:12,489 --> 01:03:14,159
- And to dry them out in the sun.
- Nice.

1650
01:03:14,159 --> 01:03:17,059
I entered the Nonsan Training Center
in early February.

1651
01:03:17,059 --> 01:03:20,269
Back then, the temperature dropped
to minus 10℃.

1652
01:03:20,269 --> 01:03:22,269
It's much colder here at night.

1653
01:03:22,670 --> 01:03:25,909
But the sleeping bag
and blankets feel damp.

1654
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:28,539
Dex would've died if he had come here.

1655
01:03:28,710 --> 01:03:29,710
Really?

1656
01:03:29,710 --> 01:03:31,550
- You would've died in the blankets.
- Really?

1657
01:03:31,550 --> 01:03:32,679
(He would've dropped out of line
as soon as he saw the blankets.)

1658
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:34,650
This is an excellent spot.

1659
01:03:35,349 --> 01:03:36,420
Come here.

1660
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,150
(Hanging out the blankets
where there's good sunlight)

1661
01:03:39,949 --> 01:03:42,789
Disinfecting them under the sunlight
helps a lot.

1662
01:03:43,420 --> 01:03:45,329
Die, bacteria.

1663
01:03:46,989 --> 01:03:48,760
Come. Bring it here.

1664
01:03:49,659 --> 01:03:51,170
This...

1665
01:03:52,130 --> 01:03:53,800
is Korean style.

1666
01:03:54,139 --> 01:03:55,769
Look. Pull it.

1667
01:03:56,070 --> 01:03:57,769
Here we go. One, two, three.

1668
01:03:58,710 --> 01:03:59,739
Okay.

1669
01:04:00,269 --> 01:04:01,539
One, two, three.

1670
01:04:01,539 --> 01:04:05,210
(Dusting off the blanket Korean style)

1671
01:04:06,280 --> 01:04:07,449
The grits...

1672
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:09,179
My goodness.

1673
01:04:10,349 --> 01:04:11,789
(Spitting out)

1674
01:04:11,789 --> 01:04:13,289
(Screaming)

1675
01:04:13,719 --> 01:04:14,820
(Laughing)

1676
01:04:14,820 --> 01:04:15,960
What's with this?

1677
01:04:16,860 --> 01:04:19,329
- Ladakh is a dry area.
- Yes?

1678
01:04:19,329 --> 01:04:21,260
Because greens and trees are hard to grow,

1679
01:04:21,260 --> 01:04:23,000
there are many rocks and sand.

1680
01:04:23,000 --> 01:04:24,369
The cloud of dust...

1681
01:04:24,369 --> 01:04:26,369
- must've accumulated on the blankets.
- I see.

1682
01:04:28,340 --> 01:04:29,400
Okay.

1683
01:04:29,800 --> 01:04:30,909
Okay, next one.

1684
01:04:33,510 --> 01:04:34,579
One, two, three.

1685
01:04:34,579 --> 01:04:35,909
(They dust off the next blanket.)

1686
01:04:38,380 --> 01:04:40,750
(It's worse.)

1687
01:04:41,050 --> 01:04:44,289
(My goodness)

1688
01:04:44,590 --> 01:04:46,090
Pull this instead of me.

1689
01:04:47,289 --> 01:04:48,989
(No way.)

1690
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,530
Hey.

1691
01:04:51,530 --> 01:04:52,559
(Dumbstruck)

1692
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:54,230
(I'm sorry.)

1693
01:04:54,230 --> 01:04:55,429
One, two, three.

1694
01:04:55,429 --> 01:04:57,869
I asked the eldest.

1695
01:04:58,400 --> 01:05:01,099
It's the warmer weather right now.

1696
01:05:01,269 --> 01:05:04,070
When it's winter, the river freezes up.

1697
01:05:04,070 --> 01:05:05,309
Doing something is impossible.

1698
01:05:05,969 --> 01:05:09,179
Because water is scarce,
I think they can't do laundry often.

1699
01:05:09,179 --> 01:05:12,449
I personally wish they would dust
the blankets off often.

1700
01:05:12,909 --> 01:05:14,019
One, two, three.

1701
01:05:14,019 --> 01:05:16,050
(With hopes they will grow up healthy)

1702
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:18,389
One, two...

1703
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:21,659
Since you taught them this method,

1704
01:05:21,659 --> 01:05:23,519
- They will make use of it.
- they'll likely use it.

1705
01:05:23,519 --> 01:05:24,590
Yes.

1706
01:05:24,590 --> 01:05:26,190
(As much as it's hard,)

1707
01:05:26,190 --> 01:05:28,400
(it's worth it.)

1708
01:05:28,860 --> 01:05:30,230
Do you want to try it?

1709
01:05:30,460 --> 01:05:33,199
Do you want to play the dust-off game?

1710
01:05:33,429 --> 01:05:35,539
You're making it into a game?

1711
01:05:35,940 --> 01:05:37,269
- That's it.
- One, two, three, four.

1712
01:05:37,269 --> 01:05:38,469
You know the drill.

1713
01:05:38,469 --> 01:05:40,369
Thinking of it as a house chore
makes it distasteful.

1714
01:05:42,679 --> 01:05:44,579
(Simply happy)

1715
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:46,480
You did something great, Kian84.

1716
01:05:46,480 --> 01:05:47,480
- Good job.
- Yes.

1717
01:05:47,480 --> 01:05:48,519
You taught them the game...

1718
01:05:48,519 --> 01:05:50,219
and how to dust off blankets.

1719
01:05:50,789 --> 01:05:51,820
(Breathing heavily)

1720
01:05:51,820 --> 01:05:53,190
You guys try it without me.

1721
01:05:53,750 --> 01:05:54,989
Try it, guys.

1722
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:57,489
(Coughing)

1723
01:05:58,159 --> 01:05:59,530
Mr. Teacher.

1724
01:05:59,530 --> 01:06:00,800
My heart is breaking.

1725
01:06:01,860 --> 01:06:03,900
(The high altitude and looking after
the kids since morning...)

1726
01:06:04,530 --> 01:06:07,099
(have completely worn him out.)

1727
01:06:07,099 --> 01:06:08,239
Be careful.

1728
01:06:09,070 --> 01:06:10,670
- One.
- One, two, three.

1729
01:06:11,769 --> 01:06:13,469
That's it. Good.

1730
01:06:14,309 --> 01:06:15,340
Yes.

1731
01:06:16,110 --> 01:06:18,210
Teach you 1 thing,
and you get that 1 thing.

1732
01:06:18,650 --> 01:06:19,980
That's good enough.

1733
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:21,579
There are those who don't even get that.

1734
01:06:21,579 --> 01:06:23,750
Yes. Some don't even get that one thing.

1735
01:06:23,750 --> 01:06:25,449
That's right. They were really smart.

1736
01:06:25,449 --> 01:06:27,119
What you said had a twist in the end.

1737
01:06:28,219 --> 01:06:29,989
(Oh, right.)

1738
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:33,460
(Putting down)

1739
01:06:34,599 --> 01:06:36,860
Those are what we painted back then.

1740
01:06:37,630 --> 01:06:40,369
(The memories of India
the 3 brothers drew)

1741
01:06:40,769 --> 01:06:43,840
(They promised to hang it up
at their last destination.)

1742
01:06:44,510 --> 01:06:45,869
Are you hanging it up there?

1743
01:06:47,480 --> 01:06:48,710
Who is me?

1744
01:06:49,139 --> 01:06:50,980
Take a look. Who?

1745
01:06:51,280 --> 01:06:52,480
This one.

1746
01:06:53,309 --> 01:06:54,650
He got it right.

1747
01:06:55,019 --> 01:06:56,719
- This one.
- This is me?

1748
01:06:56,719 --> 01:06:58,650
(Laughing)

1749
01:06:59,219 --> 01:07:00,550
They are my friends.

1750
01:07:01,219 --> 01:07:03,519
He's a Korean...

1751
01:07:04,389 --> 01:07:05,460
soldier.

1752
01:07:05,989 --> 01:07:08,159
He's a Korean...

1753
01:07:08,659 --> 01:07:10,400
Pani Bottle.

1754
01:07:10,969 --> 01:07:12,500
"Korean Pani Bottle."

1755
01:07:12,699 --> 01:07:14,340
He's a Korean water bottle.

1756
01:07:15,199 --> 01:07:17,000
(Fiddling)

1757
01:07:17,340 --> 01:07:18,869
(He's doing something with the paintings.)

1758
01:07:18,869 --> 01:07:21,079
I'm making it into a one long flag.

1759
01:07:22,940 --> 01:07:24,909
(Gathered around)

1760
01:07:25,750 --> 01:07:28,780
(Their attention
is on the one-day teacher.)

1761
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:31,150
Do you like me?

1762
01:07:31,349 --> 01:07:34,590
- Do you like me?
- Yes.

1763
01:07:34,590 --> 01:07:36,420
I like you.

1764
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:38,659
This...

1765
01:07:38,659 --> 01:07:39,760
Where should I put it up?

1766
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:40,960
I'll take your recommendations.

1767
01:07:41,730 --> 01:07:43,300
You should put it up in our school.

1768
01:07:43,699 --> 01:07:44,730
"School?"

1769
01:07:45,099 --> 01:07:46,469
Okay. Stretch it out.

1770
01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:48,800
Let's see. Stretch it out.

1771
01:07:49,340 --> 01:07:50,699
(Gosh, it's like the flag of all nations.)

1772
01:07:50,699 --> 01:07:51,969
It's the flag of all nations.

1773
01:07:52,610 --> 01:07:53,710
It looks pretty good.

1774
01:07:54,380 --> 01:07:56,809
(Hung up in all places of Ladakh,)

1775
01:07:57,309 --> 01:07:59,550
(it's their traditional flag, tharchog!)

1776
01:08:00,610 --> 01:08:02,380
(Impressed by it, he made a similar one.)

1777
01:08:02,380 --> 01:08:03,719
Let's go to the school.

1778
01:08:05,719 --> 01:08:06,920
(What?)

1779
01:08:06,920 --> 01:08:09,389
(Wait for me.)

1780
01:08:10,019 --> 01:08:12,159
Where do you think I should put it up?

1781
01:08:12,159 --> 01:08:13,190
- Here?
- Here.

1782
01:08:14,329 --> 01:08:17,699
(Hanging up the flag
on the recommended spot)

1783
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:19,029
Okay.

1784
01:08:19,630 --> 01:08:20,670
And...

1785
01:08:20,800 --> 01:08:23,369
Your paintings.

1786
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:27,310
- Put it up here.
- Yes.

1787
01:08:27,310 --> 01:08:28,539
Connect it.

1788
01:08:29,579 --> 01:08:30,579
That's a nice idea.

1789
01:08:30,579 --> 01:08:31,649
(What a great idea!)

1790
01:08:31,649 --> 01:08:34,649
When you look at this, remember me.

1791
01:08:34,649 --> 01:08:35,649
Yes.

1792
01:08:35,649 --> 01:08:37,050
Remember me when you look at it.

1793
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:40,350
(Along with the memories
the 3 brothers want to remember,)

1794
01:08:41,189 --> 01:08:43,460
(a photo of the cute 7 boy monks
has been added.)

1795
01:08:43,859 --> 01:08:46,829
(And so, the flag of memories in India
is complete.)

1796
01:08:46,829 --> 01:08:48,399
- O, P,
- O, P,

1797
01:08:48,630 --> 01:08:50,359
- Q, R,
- R,

1798
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:52,899
- S, T, U...
- S, T, U...

1799
01:08:52,899 --> 01:08:54,539
(He's a one-day teacher
who even plays patty-cake with them.)

1800
01:08:55,770 --> 01:08:57,640
(The teacher returned right on time.)

1801
01:08:57,640 --> 01:08:58,810
- Hello.
- Hello.

1802
01:08:59,970 --> 01:09:01,840
- Hello. Gosh.
- Did he go to the market, or something?

1803
01:09:01,840 --> 01:09:03,010
What is all that?

1804
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:05,279
(As the teacher was leaving,)

1805
01:09:05,710 --> 01:09:08,149
(Kian84 asked him to buy gifts
for the seven boy monks.)

1806
01:09:08,149 --> 01:09:09,520
I asked the teacher...

1807
01:09:09,520 --> 01:09:12,090
what the kids needed.

1808
01:09:12,090 --> 01:09:13,420
He said hats and jackets.

1809
01:09:13,819 --> 01:09:15,220
- Because it's cold.
- Because it's so cold.

1810
01:09:15,220 --> 01:09:16,390
- For protection against the cold?
- Yes.

1811
01:09:16,760 --> 01:09:18,789
(His whole fortune)

1812
01:09:18,890 --> 01:09:22,060
I gave him everything I had.

1813
01:09:22,060 --> 01:09:24,470
Dex and Pani Bottle gave me
leftover money...

1814
01:09:24,470 --> 01:09:27,569
from when the three of us traveled around.

1815
01:09:27,770 --> 01:09:30,270
And then I added my money to that.

1816
01:09:30,270 --> 01:09:31,310
For the gifts?

1817
01:09:31,310 --> 01:09:33,939
- Using money like this isn't a waste.
- Right.

1818
01:09:34,279 --> 01:09:35,909
- Thank you.
- How are you?

1819
01:09:35,909 --> 01:09:39,010
- I'm fine.
- Were they nice?

1820
01:09:39,010 --> 01:09:41,319
And bracket.

1821
01:09:41,720 --> 01:09:42,779
No, bricket.

1822
01:09:42,779 --> 01:09:44,250
(Cricket)

1823
01:09:44,590 --> 01:09:46,220
Brick.

1824
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:48,960
Brick. Sun.

1825
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:50,760
We dried.

1826
01:09:51,189 --> 01:09:53,329
And we played games.

1827
01:09:53,659 --> 01:09:54,859
- Okay.
- Yes.

1828
01:09:54,859 --> 01:09:56,060
(He finished stammering through
the operational report.)

1829
01:09:56,130 --> 01:09:57,460
- Jacket.
- Jacket.

1830
01:09:57,460 --> 01:09:59,899
Size? Do you know their sizes? Baby size?

1831
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:02,399
- They're different sizes.
- They're different sizes.

1832
01:10:02,399 --> 01:10:03,800
That's not a problem?

1833
01:10:04,470 --> 01:10:05,569
Here.

1834
01:10:05,569 --> 01:10:07,140
There's one of each size.

1835
01:10:07,680 --> 01:10:08,680
(What could it be?)

1836
01:10:08,680 --> 01:10:10,210
- They're going to love it.
- Here.

1837
01:10:11,210 --> 01:10:12,350
Karzam.

1838
01:10:12,510 --> 01:10:13,710
Skarzan.

1839
01:10:13,710 --> 01:10:15,180
(He called on Jigmed Skarzan,
Monk Nightmare.)

1840
01:10:15,779 --> 01:10:17,279
I'll do it.

1841
01:10:18,289 --> 01:10:21,689
Deshap?

1842
01:10:21,689 --> 01:10:23,560
(Tiring Sandup, Monk Saliva)

1843
01:10:23,560 --> 01:10:24,930
- Say, "Thank you."
- Thank you.

1844
01:10:24,930 --> 01:10:27,229
(He understood through amazing telepathy
and received his jacket.)

1845
01:10:27,960 --> 01:10:29,729
Yisip. Nawang.

1846
01:10:30,260 --> 01:10:31,430
Jimel Sabel.

1847
01:10:31,430 --> 01:10:32,500
Dorji.

1848
01:10:33,270 --> 01:10:35,439
(Everyone got their jacket.)

1849
01:10:36,140 --> 01:10:37,970
- Who is this for?
- There's no name.

1850
01:10:39,609 --> 01:10:42,140
It seems like
Crying Monk didn't get anything.

1851
01:10:42,140 --> 01:10:43,779
Oh, no.

1852
01:10:43,779 --> 01:10:44,850
He might cry.

1853
01:10:44,850 --> 01:10:46,010
- No name.
- No.

1854
01:10:46,010 --> 01:10:47,109
- Where's Crying Monk's?
- Quickly.

1855
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:49,750
- He's crying again.
- Jigmed Lachok.

1856
01:10:49,949 --> 01:10:51,020
(He's starting to cry.)

1857
01:10:51,020 --> 01:10:53,220
No. Before he starts to cry...

1858
01:10:53,420 --> 01:10:55,289
- He has to get one before he cries.
- We should have given him his first.

1859
01:10:55,289 --> 01:10:56,460
No, quickly.

1860
01:10:56,789 --> 01:10:58,060
(He's starting to cry.)

1861
01:10:58,060 --> 01:10:59,260
Jigmed Lachok.

1862
01:11:00,359 --> 01:11:01,359
(Fortunately, he received his gift
before he turned on the waterworks.)

1863
01:11:01,359 --> 01:11:03,600
- What a relief.
- What a relief.

1864
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:06,729
The corners of his mouth were wobbling.

1865
01:11:06,729 --> 01:11:08,140
That would be a problem.

1866
01:11:08,800 --> 01:11:09,899
(The gifts are endless as if there's
a vase of inexhaustible treasures.)

1867
01:11:09,899 --> 01:11:12,670
Here you go. These are from me.

1868
01:11:13,539 --> 01:11:15,239
(What's this?)

1869
01:11:15,239 --> 01:11:16,840
(Gosh, it's a jacket.)

1870
01:11:17,649 --> 01:11:18,710
Take a hat too.

1871
01:11:19,579 --> 01:11:20,979
- Take a hat.
- You're like Santa Claus.

1872
01:11:20,979 --> 01:11:22,250
- Really.
- Right.

1873
01:11:22,819 --> 01:11:24,250
Yes, try it on.

1874
01:11:24,250 --> 01:11:25,949
(Let's try on our new clothes.)

1875
01:11:26,789 --> 01:11:28,659
Monk Saliva, where's your jacket?

1876
01:11:30,489 --> 01:11:31,930
They're all matching in red.

1877
01:11:32,859 --> 01:11:35,159
The unique color of Tibetan Buddhism...

1878
01:11:35,159 --> 01:11:36,260
is red.

1879
01:11:37,329 --> 01:11:39,869
(Kian84 put Monk Saliva's sweater on him.)

1880
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:41,840
(And he helped him with his pants too.)

1881
01:11:41,840 --> 01:11:42,899
Okay?

1882
01:11:43,869 --> 01:11:46,539
(The pants almost reach his neck.)

1883
01:11:47,039 --> 01:11:48,140
Are they too long?

1884
01:11:48,739 --> 01:11:49,779
You'll grow into it soon.

1885
01:11:51,010 --> 01:11:53,350
Gosh, you look nice.

1886
01:11:53,880 --> 01:11:56,180
You'll charm everyone in Ladakh.

1887
01:11:56,180 --> 01:11:57,520
(Monk Fashion will blow Ladakh away.)

1888
01:11:57,689 --> 01:12:00,220
I dressed Monk Saliva.

1889
01:12:00,220 --> 01:12:02,489
He could have refused to wear them,

1890
01:12:02,489 --> 01:12:04,020
but he happily did,
and I'm thankful for that.

1891
01:12:04,430 --> 01:12:07,029
Actually, the clothes were
all slightly different.

1892
01:12:07,460 --> 01:12:09,100
I thought they would get into an argument
to take each other's clothes,

1893
01:12:09,100 --> 01:12:10,529
but there wasn't anything
like that at all.

1894
01:12:10,600 --> 01:12:12,699
It was nice, things like that.

1895
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:15,869
I was a bit sad
that was all I could do for them.

1896
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:18,409
They might make "Kian84 Day"
for what you did.

1897
01:12:18,510 --> 01:12:19,970
Kian84 Day might really be a thing.

1898
01:12:19,970 --> 01:12:22,079
They might make Kian84 Day.

1899
01:12:22,079 --> 01:12:24,479
They'll think of Kian84 as they recite
Buddhist scriptures in the morning.

1900
01:12:24,479 --> 01:12:26,279
Like how we celebrate May 5.

1901
01:12:26,279 --> 01:12:27,949
You're like Bang Jeong Hwan.

1902
01:12:28,079 --> 01:12:29,220
(The Bang Jeong Hwan of Ladakh)

1903
01:12:29,220 --> 01:12:30,619
- Bang Jeong Hwan?
- Bang Jeong Hwan.

1904
01:12:31,449 --> 01:12:33,149
Okay.

1905
01:12:34,020 --> 01:12:35,359
Gather around.

1906
01:12:36,189 --> 01:12:37,289
Gather around.

1907
01:12:37,289 --> 01:12:38,890
- Move closer together.
- They're adorable.

1908
01:12:38,890 --> 01:12:41,199
- They're so cute.
- Okay.

1909
01:12:41,800 --> 01:12:42,800
Okay.

1910
01:12:43,430 --> 01:12:44,529
Go.

1911
01:12:44,529 --> 01:12:45,529
(This moment will one day fade away.)

1912
01:12:45,529 --> 01:12:48,039
Look. You're hiding him a little.

1913
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,399
Come here, Crying Monk.

1914
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:50,500
(Hopefully, this picture will help them
hold onto it for a long time.)

1915
01:12:50,500 --> 01:12:51,770
All right.

1916
01:12:52,010 --> 01:12:54,409
One, two, three.

1917
01:12:54,409 --> 01:12:55,409
Smile.

1918
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,310
They're wearing matching hats.

1919
01:12:58,510 --> 01:12:59,609
Okay.

1920
01:13:01,119 --> 01:13:02,180
Thank you.

1921
01:13:02,180 --> 01:13:03,520
(Did the picture turn out nice?)

1922
01:13:03,520 --> 01:13:04,520
Wait.

1923
01:13:04,520 --> 01:13:06,050
Why is it so dark?

1924
01:13:08,319 --> 01:13:10,359
Those kids are always smiling.

1925
01:13:10,359 --> 01:13:11,659
They always have smiles on their faces.

1926
01:13:12,060 --> 01:13:14,260
(Precious)

1927
01:13:15,600 --> 01:13:18,000
This time with Kian84.

1928
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:19,000
(This time with Kian84.)

1929
01:13:19,000 --> 01:13:20,729
(No problem.)

1930
01:13:21,239 --> 01:13:23,800
(Having been a 1-day teacher
of the 7 boy monks,)

1931
01:13:24,739 --> 01:13:27,510
(a friend, and Santa Claus...)

1932
01:13:27,510 --> 01:13:29,439
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1933
01:13:29,439 --> 01:13:30,680
(is a precious memory.)

1934
01:13:30,680 --> 01:13:32,680
"We're a family."
It's like a family picture.

1935
01:13:34,050 --> 01:13:35,880
This is so nice to watch,

1936
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:38,390
but as nice as it is, saying goodbye...

1937
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:40,420
will be extremely sad.

1938
01:13:42,619 --> 01:13:43,890
Is it the last night already?

1939
01:13:43,890 --> 01:13:45,829
Yes, it's his last night here.

1940
01:13:46,689 --> 01:13:48,229
Don't you miss your moms?

1941
01:13:49,130 --> 01:13:51,470
When was the last time you saw your mom?

1942
01:13:51,470 --> 01:13:53,670
- One month.
- One month?

1943
01:13:54,130 --> 01:13:58,439
Then tell me how long you have been here.

1944
01:13:59,409 --> 01:14:00,770
Who has been here the longest?

1945
01:14:00,770 --> 01:14:02,140
I've been here for two years.

1946
01:14:02,140 --> 01:14:03,140
How long?

1947
01:14:03,279 --> 01:14:04,310
Two years?

1948
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,920
How long have you been here, Monk Saliva?

1949
01:14:09,180 --> 01:14:10,920
- You've been here a month?
- Goodness.

1950
01:14:10,920 --> 01:14:12,850
- You've been here a month?
- He must miss his mom.

1951
01:14:12,850 --> 01:14:15,159
Goodness, you're strong.

1952
01:14:15,159 --> 01:14:16,189
(He's proud of him.)

1953
01:14:16,189 --> 01:14:19,029
Did you all come here
because you want to become monks?

1954
01:14:19,159 --> 01:14:20,659
- Yes.
- Yes.

1955
01:14:20,659 --> 01:14:21,699
- Really?
- Yes.

1956
01:14:21,699 --> 01:14:22,800
Really!

1957
01:14:22,930 --> 01:14:25,930
Even though monks can't eat meat...

1958
01:14:26,029 --> 01:14:29,239
or get married in the future?

1959
01:14:29,239 --> 01:14:30,800
I still want to be one.

1960
01:14:31,210 --> 01:14:33,539
Do you think I'm married or not married?

1961
01:14:33,539 --> 01:14:35,010
- Not married.
- Not married.

1962
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:38,109
I guess they smelled singlehood on you.

1963
01:14:38,109 --> 01:14:39,710
Maybe I smell like an old bachelor.

1964
01:14:40,010 --> 01:14:41,050
You're right.

1965
01:14:41,449 --> 01:14:43,250
I'm not married.

1966
01:14:43,250 --> 01:14:45,850
How long are you all going to stay here?

1967
01:14:45,850 --> 01:14:47,520
Wouldn't it be nice to go downtown...

1968
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:51,060
and see the city and be outside?

1969
01:14:51,260 --> 01:14:53,029
I'm going to be here for a long time.

1970
01:14:53,029 --> 01:14:54,090
Really?

1971
01:14:54,189 --> 01:14:56,100
They really have no greed.

1972
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:57,329
They're so pure.

1973
01:14:57,329 --> 01:14:59,170
They might not think it's good
to go out the way we do.

1974
01:14:59,170 --> 01:15:00,300
Right.

1975
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,439
What do you think happiness is?

1976
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:03,939
Are you happy?

1977
01:15:04,140 --> 01:15:05,739
Is living here happiness for you?

1978
01:15:05,810 --> 01:15:07,880
Becoming a monk is happiness.

1979
01:15:07,880 --> 01:15:10,739
Monks don't have to herd flocks of sheep,

1980
01:15:10,739 --> 01:15:12,909
and they don't eat meat.

1981
01:15:12,909 --> 01:15:14,550
You're happy about not eating meat?

1982
01:15:14,649 --> 01:15:16,550
Don't you know
how delicious fried chicken is?

1983
01:15:16,619 --> 01:15:17,890
Why did you...

1984
01:15:19,250 --> 01:15:21,119
You enticed them a whole lot.

1985
01:15:21,319 --> 01:15:23,720
Yak steak?

1986
01:15:24,060 --> 01:15:25,090
They're very delicious.

1987
01:15:25,090 --> 01:15:27,430
- How disrespectful.
- How disrespectful.

1988
01:15:27,760 --> 01:15:29,060
No?

1989
01:15:29,060 --> 01:15:30,859
- No.
- No?

1990
01:15:30,859 --> 01:15:32,000
Really?

1991
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:34,739
But you seemed the happiest
when you were playing cricket.

1992
01:15:34,739 --> 01:15:35,770
Look.

1993
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:38,909
Would you rather be
a professional cricket player or a monk?

1994
01:15:38,970 --> 01:15:40,810
- Be a monk.
- Be a monk.

1995
01:15:40,810 --> 01:15:42,609
- They're resolute.
- Gosh, really?

1996
01:15:43,479 --> 01:15:45,510
Then what about the eldest?
What do you think is happiness?

1997
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,949
Living here is nice,

1998
01:15:48,949 --> 01:15:52,149
and I was happy while playing
the Korean games today too.

1999
01:15:52,489 --> 01:15:56,020
If you're 18,
you're going through puberty.

2000
01:15:56,020 --> 01:15:59,329
Since you're going through puberty,
don't you want to make a girlfriend?

2001
01:15:59,430 --> 01:16:02,430
We want to become monks.
We don't think about anything else.

2002
01:16:02,529 --> 01:16:04,300
You're not interested in girls?

2003
01:16:04,300 --> 01:16:05,329
Really?

2004
01:16:06,329 --> 01:16:07,829
(He can't believe it.)

2005
01:16:08,170 --> 01:16:09,840
Maybe you're the one who's too tainted.

2006
01:16:10,239 --> 01:16:12,369
You're having a hard time
accepting these kids' innocence.

2007
01:16:12,369 --> 01:16:14,069
Well, it's because I'm so curious.

2008
01:16:14,069 --> 01:16:15,109
Right.

2009
01:16:15,409 --> 01:16:18,510
It seems like you've already
reached enlightenment at 18.

2010
01:16:18,510 --> 01:16:20,050
(You must've reached enlightenment
at 18 years of age.)

2011
01:16:20,279 --> 01:16:22,380
I feel as if I've opened Pandora's box.

2012
01:16:22,720 --> 01:16:24,920
I already know about the good things...

2013
01:16:24,920 --> 01:16:26,250
and the delicious things in the world.

2014
01:16:26,689 --> 01:16:29,189
So, to be honest,
I can't live like a monk.

2015
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:33,060
They haven't opened Pandora's box yet.

2016
01:16:33,060 --> 01:16:35,060
Maybe that's why those kids are happier.

2017
01:16:35,430 --> 01:16:37,000
That's what I think.

2018
01:16:39,100 --> 01:16:41,029
Study hard to be a monk.

2019
01:16:41,270 --> 01:16:44,569
We all live to be happy.

2020
01:16:44,569 --> 01:16:46,770
I think you and I are the same
in that sense.

2021
01:16:46,770 --> 01:16:48,409
And it feels like
I'm also training myself spiritually.

2022
01:16:48,409 --> 01:16:49,880
Our ways are different,

2023
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:53,079
but I think we all keep studying ways...

2024
01:16:53,079 --> 01:16:56,079
to be happy in life.

2025
01:16:57,380 --> 01:16:59,989
Is there anything you want to ask me
for the last time?

2026
01:17:01,289 --> 01:17:04,520
I want to come with you.

2027
01:17:04,520 --> 01:17:06,289
(Hiding under the blanket)

2028
01:17:08,329 --> 01:17:10,000
- Gosh.
- He must have enjoyed his time with you.

2029
01:17:10,130 --> 01:17:12,199
Right. Think of how memorable...

2030
01:17:12,970 --> 01:17:14,369
those two days must have been.

2031
01:17:15,699 --> 01:17:18,010
He says he's going with you
when you leave.

2032
01:17:20,810 --> 01:17:23,210
Do you want me to be your dad?
Do you want to be my son?

2033
01:17:24,439 --> 01:17:25,609
Do you want to be my son?

2034
01:17:25,949 --> 01:17:27,909
- Yes.
- Yes?

2035
01:17:27,909 --> 01:17:30,180
You must have felt so emotional.

2036
01:17:31,789 --> 01:17:34,220
Say, "Dad."

2037
01:17:34,819 --> 01:17:36,260
- Dad.
- Dad.

2038
01:17:36,260 --> 01:17:37,789
- Dad.
- That's right.

2039
01:17:38,859 --> 01:17:40,229
You are my sons.

2040
01:17:40,229 --> 01:17:42,329
(You are my sons.)

2041
01:17:42,600 --> 01:17:43,829
Say, "Dad."

2042
01:17:45,899 --> 01:17:48,039
I couldn't help but chuckle
when I heard them say that.

2043
01:17:48,039 --> 01:17:49,140
"Say, 'Dad.'"

2044
01:17:49,199 --> 01:17:50,300
"Dad!"

2045
01:17:50,470 --> 01:17:54,670
(Hearing them say "Dad"
makes him laugh with joy.)

2046
01:17:55,239 --> 01:18:00,050
(When they first met each other,
it was very awkward.)

2047
01:18:01,350 --> 01:18:04,020
(Their innocence found each other,)

2048
01:18:04,020 --> 01:18:07,689
(and their walls crumbled down soon.)

2049
01:18:08,760 --> 01:18:13,689
(They made memories together
beyond borders and generations.)

2050
01:18:14,930 --> 01:18:16,199
I always think about...

2051
01:18:16,199 --> 01:18:18,229
what the best way to live is.

2052
01:18:18,670 --> 01:18:20,430
The conclusion I've drawn is...

2053
01:18:20,670 --> 01:18:23,000
that the best way is to live happily.

2054
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:25,069
("Since we were born into this life,
let's live happily.")

2055
01:18:25,470 --> 01:18:29,010
Whatever they do, I hope they're happy.

2056
01:18:29,880 --> 01:18:32,649
The enlightenment
they're training to reach...

2057
01:18:32,649 --> 01:18:36,449
I hope they become good monks
who reach enlightenment.

2058
01:18:36,449 --> 01:18:37,520
(He wholeheartedly wishes for
the 7 boy monks to be happy.)

2059
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,619
I want to cheer for them.

2060
01:18:39,619 --> 01:18:41,659
("I want to cheer for them
with all my heart.")

2061
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:43,720
(I had a good time today.)

2062
01:18:44,689 --> 01:18:46,890
Visit us again. Let's have fun.

2063
01:18:47,630 --> 01:18:49,600
Kim, let's hang out when you visit again.

2064
01:18:50,600 --> 01:18:51,729
- He's cute.
- He's cute.

2065
01:18:52,069 --> 01:18:54,500
- I want to play with Kim more.
- I want to play with Kim more.

2066
01:18:59,510 --> 01:19:01,909
- You should write a video letter to them.
- Yes.

2067
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:03,039
Why would I?

2068
01:19:03,039 --> 01:19:04,210
- They might watch it.
- Give it a try.

2069
01:19:04,210 --> 01:19:06,250
Why? After asking them to call you Dad?

2070
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:07,310
He's touched.

2071
01:19:07,310 --> 01:19:10,020
They must be looking for you
and saying, "Dad."

2072
01:19:10,020 --> 01:19:11,350
They have fathers at home.

2073
01:19:11,350 --> 01:19:12,520
- You told them to call you Dad.
- They have real fathers.

2074
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:13,920
- I'm not their father.
- You're their Korean dad.

2075
01:19:13,920 --> 01:19:15,619
- You're their Korean dad.
- Yes.

2076
01:19:15,619 --> 01:19:17,189
- Their second dad.
- Yes.

2077
01:19:17,689 --> 01:19:18,789
Hi, kids.

2078
01:19:18,789 --> 01:19:21,899
You don't have smartphones there.

2079
01:19:21,899 --> 01:19:23,500
So I'm not sure if you'll watch this,

2080
01:19:24,729 --> 01:19:27,470
but I'm cheering for you, seven monks.

2081
01:19:27,470 --> 01:19:29,270
Please stay healthy,

2082
01:19:31,270 --> 01:19:34,010
and I wish you happiness in life.

2083
01:19:34,010 --> 01:19:35,109
Thank you.

2084
01:19:38,880 --> 01:19:41,380
Okay. Let's go to bed.
I'm sorry. It's late.

2085
01:19:41,550 --> 01:19:43,350
You should go to bed.

2086
01:19:43,350 --> 01:19:44,989
- They must be sad.
- Let's sleep.

2087
01:19:44,989 --> 01:19:46,090
Hey, come.

2088
01:19:46,619 --> 01:19:47,649
Come.

2089
01:19:48,460 --> 01:19:49,659
Come here.

2090
01:19:49,659 --> 01:19:51,119
(Kim who is exhausted
from taking care of the kids all day...)

2091
01:19:52,460 --> 01:19:56,600
(and the mischievous 7 boy monks
get under the blanket.)

2092
01:19:56,600 --> 01:20:00,630
So, I had to leave
before they woke up the next morning.

2093
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:02,739
So it was the last moment.

2094
01:20:02,739 --> 01:20:04,770
- It was the very last moment.
- That's why I talked with them.

2095
01:20:05,770 --> 01:20:06,810
Good night.

2096
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:08,609
Good night.

2097
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:11,140
Good night.

2098
01:20:11,140 --> 01:20:14,449
(They try to sleep,
leaning against one another's warmth.)

2099
01:20:15,250 --> 01:20:16,649
(His last night in India is deepening.)

2100
01:20:16,649 --> 01:20:17,750
It's the last night.

2101
01:20:18,720 --> 01:20:19,819
It's farewell.

2102
01:20:23,090 --> 01:20:25,890
(Rustling)

2103
01:20:26,560 --> 01:20:30,260
(The dawn has come.)

2104
01:20:30,260 --> 01:20:32,829
Even before the sun rose, he came outside.

2105
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:35,399
(Kim leaves before the dawn breaks.)

2106
01:20:38,340 --> 01:20:40,270
It looks like he's running away
under the cover of darkness.

2107
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:42,010
Like he has never seen the sun before.

2108
01:20:42,310 --> 01:20:43,609
How disrespectful.

2109
01:20:43,609 --> 01:20:45,279
You ruined my beautiful picture.

2110
01:20:45,750 --> 01:20:47,380
(He's moving with a tired look,
which shows how exhausting it was...)

2111
01:20:47,380 --> 01:20:48,550
(to take care of the kids.)

2112
01:20:48,649 --> 01:20:50,779
Gosh. I feel like I'm going to die.

2113
01:20:51,020 --> 01:20:53,020
He must've been in a very bad condition.

2114
01:20:55,119 --> 01:20:56,119
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

2115
01:20:56,119 --> 01:20:57,819
(Monk Saliva followed him out
as he heard Kim leaving.)

2116
01:20:57,819 --> 01:20:58,859
Oh, my.

2117
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:00,760
(I heard something.)

2118
01:21:01,430 --> 01:21:03,260
He ran without shoes on.

2119
01:21:03,659 --> 01:21:05,569
(Dad!)

2120
01:21:06,069 --> 01:21:09,770
(Monk Saliva wasn't shy
around Kim at all.)

2121
01:21:10,670 --> 01:21:14,939
(It was a short time,
but the two got very close.)

2122
01:21:14,939 --> 01:21:15,979
Oh, gosh.

2123
01:21:16,210 --> 01:21:17,680
(They are running toward each other.)

2124
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,109
He came out to say goodbye.

2125
01:21:19,449 --> 01:21:20,649
I grew attached to him.

2126
01:21:21,279 --> 01:21:22,319
Bye.

2127
01:21:22,579 --> 01:21:24,850
- Oh, my. Look at his small hands.
- You're sleepy, aren't you?

2128
01:21:25,149 --> 01:21:26,420
Hurry up, and go back to bed.

2129
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:28,020
Take care. Okay?

2130
01:21:30,819 --> 01:21:32,329
- Sleep more.
- He must've been tired.

2131
01:21:32,329 --> 01:21:34,329
He kept waking up.

2132
01:21:34,489 --> 01:21:36,060
Bye. Go back to bed.

2133
01:21:36,060 --> 01:21:40,430
(He said farewell with regrets.)

2134
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:44,300
His feet must've felt so heavy.

2135
01:21:47,670 --> 01:21:52,550
(He stopped by Tso Moriri Lake
before leaving.)

2136
01:21:54,010 --> 01:21:55,050
It's finally...

2137
01:21:55,720 --> 01:21:57,220
the last day in India.

2138
01:21:57,220 --> 01:21:58,390
I'm going back.

2139
01:21:59,090 --> 01:22:01,449
I'm going to see the sunrise
one last time...

2140
01:22:02,560 --> 01:22:03,720
before I go.

2141
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:07,090
I wanted to see the sunrise
one last time...

2142
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:11,800
and organize my thoughts. So I went there.

2143
01:22:14,100 --> 01:22:19,239
(He's slowly looking around the scenery
as he's sad to leave.)

2144
01:22:21,039 --> 01:22:24,810
A ray of sunlight is coming down gently.

2145
01:22:24,810 --> 01:22:26,680
(A ray of sunlight is coming down slowly
at the perfect timing.)

2146
01:22:27,310 --> 01:22:28,680
It's rising.

2147
01:22:29,479 --> 01:22:30,680
(Excited)

2148
01:22:30,680 --> 01:22:31,750
It's rising.

2149
01:22:32,989 --> 01:22:34,189
The sun has risen.

2150
01:22:34,189 --> 01:22:37,289
(The sun has risen.)

2151
01:22:37,289 --> 01:22:38,760
I got goosebumps.

2152
01:22:38,930 --> 01:22:42,300
In season one, the sun set at the end.

2153
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:44,500
But season two ended with the sunrise.

2154
01:22:44,500 --> 01:22:47,600
It feels weird.

2155
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:49,770
It's Kian84's new beginning.

2156
01:22:49,770 --> 01:22:53,810
And it's also another great start
for our show.

2157
01:22:53,810 --> 01:22:55,779
It's the beginning for all of us.

2158
01:22:56,409 --> 01:22:58,909
It's something I always see,
but I'm so happy to see it.

2159
01:22:59,609 --> 01:23:01,050
It looks wonderful.

2160
01:23:02,550 --> 01:23:03,649
Can you see it?

2161
01:23:04,720 --> 01:23:06,250
It's strangely touching.

2162
01:23:10,720 --> 01:23:13,390
(Kian84's dream country to travel to)

2163
01:23:13,390 --> 01:23:14,890
(India)

2164
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:18,600
(He went on a second trip
after a long time.)

2165
01:23:19,229 --> 01:23:22,270
(The unfamiliar sights...)

2166
01:23:22,270 --> 01:23:25,439
(made him flustered for a moment,)

2167
01:23:26,109 --> 01:23:29,340
(but he accepted dynamic India
with his entire body.)

2168
01:23:29,340 --> 01:23:31,279
So many things happened.

2169
01:23:33,350 --> 01:23:35,420
(India84 became one with India like that.)

2170
01:23:35,420 --> 01:23:36,819
I can't believe it,
even though I'm watching it.

2171
01:23:36,819 --> 01:23:38,319
It was on my bucket list.

2172
01:23:38,319 --> 01:23:41,520
(He took out his dreams on his bucket list
1 by 1 in the dream country.)

2173
01:23:42,359 --> 01:23:46,229
(He put down everything
at the crematorium.)

2174
01:23:46,729 --> 01:23:51,399
(He enjoyed a wedding
more than the locals themselves.)

2175
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,869
(He could see different worlds
in every compartment in a train in India.)

2176
01:23:55,699 --> 01:24:01,140
(Wherever he went,
unexpected things happened.)

2177
01:24:01,979 --> 01:24:05,079
("Traveling is a magical moment where
you can have unexpected experiences.")

2178
01:24:05,550 --> 01:24:09,579
(He fully enjoyed the trip.)

2179
01:24:10,649 --> 01:24:13,319
(His special friends...)

2180
01:24:13,319 --> 01:24:16,520
(made all of these possible.)

2181
01:24:16,819 --> 01:24:18,859
It feels like I watched a youth drama.

2182
01:24:18,859 --> 01:24:19,890
(Laughing and cheering together)

2183
01:24:20,359 --> 01:24:23,260
(I'm so lucky to have met you guys.)

2184
01:24:24,159 --> 01:24:28,199
(There were other friends who stayed
with him throughout the journey.)

2185
01:24:28,500 --> 01:24:30,699
It felt like I was traveling with them
for ten weeks.

2186
01:24:30,699 --> 01:24:33,109
I don't think even a movie
can be made like this.

2187
01:24:33,109 --> 01:24:36,340
It was a refreshing trip.

2188
01:24:37,140 --> 01:24:39,909
(And precious people he met in India
that he is thankful for)

2189
01:24:40,210 --> 01:24:43,350
(He could experience the unfamiliar world
more deeply thanks to them.)

2190
01:24:43,880 --> 01:24:46,619
(He made unforgettable memories
by accident.)

2191
01:24:47,350 --> 01:24:48,460
It was fun.

2192
01:24:48,460 --> 01:24:50,020
(After finishing the journey
where he traveled 13,346km in total...)

2193
01:24:51,689 --> 01:24:55,899
Now, I'm going back to Korea
to catch up on things.

2194
01:24:55,899 --> 01:24:57,300
(It's time to go back
to his daily life now.)

2195
01:24:57,529 --> 01:24:59,100
There are so many things to do.

2196
01:25:00,000 --> 01:25:02,600
But I can't wait to work on them.

2197
01:25:03,170 --> 01:25:06,569
I feel grateful for my daily life
after coming to India.

2198
01:25:06,569 --> 01:25:08,710
(He gained energy to return
to his mundane life through this trip.)

2199
01:25:08,710 --> 01:25:10,079
The sun has risen.

2200
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:12,180
Let's...

2201
01:25:13,310 --> 01:25:16,479
do our best in life.

2202
01:25:16,920 --> 01:25:18,149
Why do we have to do our best?

2203
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:21,250
Everyone, do what you want in life...

2204
01:25:22,090 --> 01:25:23,189
and die.

2205
01:25:24,819 --> 01:25:26,390
- People all die.
- Yes.

2206
01:25:26,390 --> 01:25:28,260
- You should have no regrets when you die.
- It's to leave no regrets.

2207
01:25:30,899 --> 01:25:32,500
I'll see you again in Korea.

2208
01:25:37,140 --> 01:25:40,170
(The long yet short trip to India ends!)

2209
01:25:54,489 --> 01:25:55,590
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

2210
01:25:56,260 --> 01:25:58,460
(Adventure by Accident 2)

2211
01:25:58,460 --> 01:25:59,659
It was touching.

2212
01:25:59,760 --> 01:26:02,460
(The second journey is over.)

2213
01:26:02,460 --> 01:26:04,399
(Here's a bonus scene.)

2214
01:26:05,229 --> 01:26:09,100
(Last July,
after finishing the second journey,)

2215
01:26:09,739 --> 01:26:12,710
(Kian84 came to feel the sea.)

2216
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:18,039
I'm not impressed because I'm old.

2217
01:26:19,250 --> 01:26:20,850
The infrastructure here is too good.

2218
01:26:21,350 --> 01:26:23,880
Trains and cars. So many restaurants.

2219
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:26,020
What kind of sea do you want to go to?

2220
01:26:26,319 --> 01:26:29,289
The sea people depend on to make a living.

2221
01:26:30,659 --> 01:26:32,359
Where people fish...

2222
01:26:32,989 --> 01:26:34,260
- with harpoons.
- Harpoons.

2223
01:26:34,529 --> 01:26:35,930
A beautiful sea.

2224
01:26:37,460 --> 01:26:39,029
(It suits a manly man in nature.)

2225
01:26:39,029 --> 01:26:40,729
I'm going into the water.

2226
01:26:41,430 --> 01:26:42,470
(Diving)

2227
01:26:42,470 --> 01:26:44,539
Let's go to the sea in season three.

2228
01:26:44,539 --> 01:26:45,609
Let's go.

2229
01:26:46,939 --> 01:26:49,079
(Into the wild)

2230
01:26:50,840 --> 01:26:52,979
(Adventure by Accident will return...)

2231
01:26:52,979 --> 01:26:55,750
(with the primeval sea!)
