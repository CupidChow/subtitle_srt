1
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:29,040
(Entering a small street
after eating dessert)

2
00:01:29,140 --> 00:01:30,880
(Today's schedule, Crematorium at 4 p.m.)

3
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,480
(Arti puja with Bicky at 6 p.m.)

4
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,450
- What?
- What's that?

5
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:35,679
Everyone.

6
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,650
An Indian cow.

7
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:41,889
Namaste.

8
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,189
(Greeting the Indian cow
he met on the small street)

9
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:45,360
Namaste.

10
00:01:47,459 --> 00:01:50,700
(Carefully petting it)

11
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:53,270
The cow seems very used to that.

12
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:56,070
In India, cows are very sacred.

13
00:01:56,139 --> 00:01:57,369
Is it okay to touch them?

14
00:01:57,369 --> 00:02:00,610
It's not a big problem
to pet or touch them like that.

15
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:04,079
- White cows are more sacred.
- I see.

16
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:06,210
When locals pass by and see a white cow,

17
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,019
- they pet them.
- I see.

18
00:02:09,019 --> 00:02:11,619
From what I felt, they see monkeys...

19
00:02:11,619 --> 00:02:13,519
and all animals as sacred.

20
00:02:14,089 --> 00:02:16,759
In utopias,
animals and humans all live together.

21
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:19,059
- Yes. They all connect.
- Yes. Kind of like that.

22
00:02:19,059 --> 00:02:20,360
(In India, people live in harmony
with various animals.)

23
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:25,059
It's a blessing for cows
to be born in India.

24
00:02:28,269 --> 00:02:30,270
(Flinching)

25
00:02:30,999 --> 00:02:34,009
(He was a bit surprised,
but he still keeps petting the cow.)

26
00:02:36,279 --> 00:02:39,109
(Getting up close and making eye contact)

27
00:02:40,880 --> 00:02:42,350
- Oh, my.
- Oh, it's coming closer.

28
00:02:42,619 --> 00:02:44,419
(Putting it on the ground)

29
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:47,589
(Putting civilization down
and attempting to commune)

30
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:50,290
(Stepping forward)

31
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:55,430
(He bravely puts his face on the cow.)

32
00:02:55,729 --> 00:02:57,029
(Moving away)

33
00:02:57,999 --> 00:02:59,100
Come here.

34
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,699
(Almost about to break the phone)

35
00:03:03,669 --> 00:03:04,740
Oh, no.

36
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:08,369
Back step.

37
00:03:09,710 --> 00:03:11,609
(Kicking it with his foot)

38
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:12,880
Why are you kicking your phone?

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:15,479
I was worried
the cow might kick me with his back legs.

40
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,180
- Cowie.
- Cowie.

41
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:19,719
Have a good life.

42
00:03:21,719 --> 00:03:22,859
Oh, I'm scared.

43
00:03:22,859 --> 00:03:24,359
(Hurriedly retrieving civilization)

44
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,460
(If you're going to use it like that,
give it to me.)

45
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,460
Sorry.

46
00:03:31,859 --> 00:03:35,270
(On the move again
after saying bye to Cowie)

47
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:37,599
Now that I'm slowly...

48
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:39,469
- Excuse me.
- heading toward the city,

49
00:03:40,010 --> 00:03:42,740
I can feel the heat of the World Cup.

50
00:03:42,939 --> 00:03:44,110
Excuse me.

51
00:03:44,939 --> 00:03:46,680
- I'm a big fan of you.
- What?

52
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:48,349
- What? She's a fan.
- Wait. That's a fan.

53
00:03:48,349 --> 00:03:49,719
You know?

54
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:51,650
Yes, Kian84.

55
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:52,719
- Oh, my.
- Oh, my.

56
00:03:52,719 --> 00:03:54,819
(She recognized Kian84.)

57
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,490
- How wild.
- It was very fascinating.

58
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,890
- Seriously.
- Why?

59
00:03:58,619 --> 00:04:01,990
(Actually, she carefully
approached him...)

60
00:04:02,559 --> 00:04:04,529
(from quite far away.)

61
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,599
- I watch Korean TV programs.
- Oh, my.

62
00:04:06,599 --> 00:04:08,400
- How wild.
- Korean movies?

63
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,300
- I'm not Korean...
- Documentary.

64
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,469
Documentary? How? What?

65
00:04:12,469 --> 00:04:14,569
- I like it.
- What program?

66
00:04:15,069 --> 00:04:16,680
I saw you here and there.

67
00:04:16,939 --> 00:04:19,749
I don't think she was a big fan.
I think she just recognized my face.

68
00:04:19,749 --> 00:04:21,279
- But still.
- But still.

69
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,580
- In such a far away place.
- That's so nice.

70
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,150
She knows your name.

71
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:25,990
- Seriously.
- It's nice.

72
00:04:26,719 --> 00:04:27,789
- Hi.
- Hi. Thank you.

73
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:29,360
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

74
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:30,659
- Nice to meet you.
- Thank you.

75
00:04:30,659 --> 00:04:33,159
- Can we take a picture?
- What? Oh, yes.

76
00:04:33,559 --> 00:04:35,460
Gosh. Someone here recognizes me.

77
00:04:36,599 --> 00:04:38,360
- I like Koreans so much.
- We have watched you before.

78
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,469
- BLACKPINK.
- Oh, my.

79
00:04:40,099 --> 00:04:42,670
(He's as popular as BLACKPINK.)

80
00:04:43,670 --> 00:04:46,270
- Thank you.
- Of course. Study hard.

81
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,610
- Thank you.
- Of course.

82
00:04:47,610 --> 00:04:48,640
(Giving kind advice in Korean)

83
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,879
- Bye.
- Taking care of your fans.

84
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,279
Gosh.

85
00:04:53,580 --> 00:04:55,749
(He can't hide his smile.)

86
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:59,789
Gosh. People in India recognize me.

87
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,119
Gosh.

88
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,659
What if I get...

89
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:09,499
so famous
that I can't even travel in India?

90
00:05:10,129 --> 00:05:11,460
You're doing fine traveling in India.

91
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:14,330
Gosh. How tiring.

92
00:05:14,969 --> 00:05:16,240
(Move.)

93
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,469
- Yes, sir.
- Honking right away.

94
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:19,839
Gosh.

95
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:23,409
It's a monkey.

96
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:24,680
(A monkey on top of the streetlight)

97
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,879
Hey, be careful. You might get shocked.

98
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:28,010
(Worried)

99
00:05:30,249 --> 00:05:31,249
(Spotting a puppy this time)

100
00:05:31,249 --> 00:05:33,589
Hey. It's dangerous.

101
00:05:33,589 --> 00:05:35,689
Go in. Over there.

102
00:05:36,390 --> 00:05:37,520
Go over there.

103
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,289
(After walking around
while supervising animals' safety,)

104
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:42,960
(he finds the street filled with people.)

105
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:49,700
(Stopping)

106
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:51,870
Hello.

107
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:53,770
(Sounding folksy)

108
00:05:54,039 --> 00:05:56,479
- Oh, cross...
- Crossbody bag.

109
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,479
- A crossbody bag.
- A crossbody bag.

110
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,450
I only had a big bag.

111
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,849
I needed a small bag to put my wallet in.

112
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:05,890
This one's nice. An elephant.

113
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:08,349
- How much?
- It's 200.

114
00:06:08,349 --> 00:06:09,719
- It's 200?
- Yes.

115
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:11,719
(Showing him how it looks)

116
00:06:11,719 --> 00:06:12,859
It's cute.

117
00:06:14,729 --> 00:06:16,260
It's cool.

118
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:18,700
(He really likes the elephant bag.)

119
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,799
Okay, 200.

120
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,070
I have it. Okay.

121
00:06:23,070 --> 00:06:24,270
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

122
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:26,739
- Why didn't you haggle?
- You didn't negotiate?

123
00:06:26,739 --> 00:06:27,770
- Oh, right.
- You need to haggle.

124
00:06:27,770 --> 00:06:29,979
Because he was wearing a button-up shirt,

125
00:06:29,979 --> 00:06:32,010
- I didn't think he'd rip me off.
- You could trust him?

126
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:33,880
- What kind of logic is that?
- He looked trustworthy.

127
00:06:34,650 --> 00:06:36,679
- He's so pure.
- Seriously.

128
00:06:36,679 --> 00:06:38,620
Kian84's so innocent. He doesn't haggle.

129
00:06:39,190 --> 00:06:40,289
I hope you sell a lot.

130
00:06:41,390 --> 00:06:42,620
They sell pants there.

131
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:44,320
- What?
- Stretchy pants. Aladdin pants.

132
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:46,359
- Aladdin pants?
- Yes. Aladdin pants for 200 rupees.

133
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:48,729
- Stretchy pants are 210 rupees.
- Oh, no.

134
00:06:48,789 --> 00:06:50,299
- How does he know stretchy pants?
- Sorry.

135
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:52,870
- Many Korean tourists must go there.
- It's okay.

136
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:54,700
- That's how he can speak Korean.
- Right.

137
00:06:54,900 --> 00:06:56,700
I don't need to buy any. I need to go.

138
00:06:58,239 --> 00:07:00,669
- Hello.
- Hello.

139
00:07:02,679 --> 00:07:04,239
This is nice. Things like this.

140
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:05,609
Wait.

141
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,479
How much?

142
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:08,609
It's 350.

143
00:07:08,679 --> 00:07:10,179
- Oh, 350.
- Yes.

144
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,820
- It's 350?
- Yes, 350 only.

145
00:07:13,390 --> 00:07:15,020
- Three...
- Three, five, zero. Three hundred fifty.

146
00:07:15,020 --> 00:07:16,089
- Oh, 350?
- Yes.

147
00:07:16,089 --> 00:07:17,560
Gosh. I should've bought that instead.

148
00:07:18,089 --> 00:07:19,589
Okay. This one.

149
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:23,099
- This is 350.
- Did you end up buying ten bags?

150
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,669
The strap was so thin.
I was worried it would snap.

151
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,339
(Glancing over)

152
00:07:29,570 --> 00:07:31,140
(Spotting something)

153
00:07:31,140 --> 00:07:33,969
Hey. This. How much?

154
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,179
- It's the same one.
- You're right. It's the same design.

155
00:07:36,409 --> 00:07:39,039
(A similar design to the 200-rupee bag)

156
00:07:40,150 --> 00:07:43,419
(How much will it be here?)

157
00:07:43,779 --> 00:07:45,719
- It's 100.
- Gosh.

158
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:47,620
(Oh, no)

159
00:07:47,620 --> 00:07:48,890
- You were ripped off.
- Oh, no.

160
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:51,620
I wasn't supposed to think...
in terms of Korean prices.

161
00:07:51,659 --> 00:07:52,989
Because I was thinking
in terms of Korean prices,

162
00:07:52,989 --> 00:07:54,289
- I spent too much.
- Of course.

163
00:07:54,289 --> 00:07:56,130
You can't buy things
at the entrance of a market.

164
00:07:56,130 --> 00:07:58,029
The entrance is always the most expensive.

165
00:07:58,630 --> 00:08:01,599
(Bag with thick straps, 350 rupees.
Around 5 dollars and 50 cents)

166
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,070
- Fifty. You sell.
- What?

167
00:08:04,469 --> 00:08:05,669
Fifty.

168
00:08:06,609 --> 00:08:10,440
(Earlier, he heard three fifty,
which is 350.)

169
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,279
(By fifty, he means 50.)

170
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:14,109
- Fifty?
- Fifty. Do you want to buy it?

171
00:08:14,109 --> 00:08:16,080
- Are you trying to resell it?
- You. fifty.

172
00:08:16,349 --> 00:08:17,750
- You buy.
- Can I have fifty?

173
00:08:18,250 --> 00:08:19,719
(Confused)

174
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,950
- Do you want to buy it?
- No. I'm not buying it.

175
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:23,289
No buy? Okay.

176
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,789
- Bye.
- Bye.

177
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:28,960
That's how it is to sell things.

178
00:08:30,630 --> 00:08:33,169
(After his clean-cut transaction
with no haggling)

179
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,029
(Current time 1 p.m., 38°C)

180
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:36,339
- It was 38°C?
- Yes, 38°C.

181
00:08:37,239 --> 00:08:38,700
I got here alive.

182
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:40,310
(Going back to his lodging for a moment
to avoid the hot weather)

183
00:08:40,310 --> 00:08:41,310
Oh, it's cool in here.

184
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:44,010
During the day, it gets up to about 40°C.

185
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:45,950
People take breaks during the peak.

186
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:48,049
- Right. Because it's too hot.
- Because it's too hot.

187
00:08:50,549 --> 00:08:53,989
(Thanks to that, Kian84 also...)

188
00:08:53,989 --> 00:08:57,960
(gets to enjoy a nice nap
following local traditions.)

189
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,429
(Kian84 leaves his lodging
after a short rest.)

190
00:09:02,429 --> 00:09:03,529
You slept well.

191
00:09:05,859 --> 00:09:08,099
It's 4 p.m. now.

192
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,239
I'll head to the crematorium.

193
00:09:12,239 --> 00:09:13,969
(Oh, my!)

194
00:09:14,469 --> 00:09:15,909
(A monkey was guarding the street.)

195
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,880
(Attempting to give him a fierce greeting)

196
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:19,650
- Oh, my.
- What?

197
00:09:19,979 --> 00:09:21,710
Why are you angry?

198
00:09:22,479 --> 00:09:24,080
Gosh. He suddenly ran at me.

199
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,820
(Leaving cooly after a welcoming touch)

200
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,549
Gosh, this monkey.

201
00:09:27,549 --> 00:09:28,650
(Surprised)

202
00:09:29,359 --> 00:09:30,820
What are you? Are you a friend?

203
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:31,890
(Another welcome monkey)

204
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:35,429
(Shouting)

205
00:09:36,429 --> 00:09:38,229
(Shouting)

206
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:40,969
It seems surprised.

207
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,440
- Oh, my.
- Oh, you won.

208
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:47,039
I almost lost my GoPro to the monkey.

209
00:09:47,570 --> 00:09:49,380
It'd be a disaster for me to lose this.

210
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:51,880
I should format this ahead of time.

211
00:09:53,650 --> 00:09:55,279
- Formatting means...
- Format...

212
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,820
- getting rid of everything.
- Oh, right.

213
00:09:57,179 --> 00:09:58,319
- Right.
- Backup!

214
00:09:58,319 --> 00:09:59,549
- Backup.
- Yes. That's it.

215
00:09:59,549 --> 00:10:00,990
- Backup.
- I'm sorry.

216
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:03,059
- It's okay to get confused.
- Make formatting a routine.

217
00:10:03,059 --> 00:10:04,059
- I will.
- Yes.

218
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:05,360
I'm on my way now.

219
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,890
(Heading to the crematorium
after learning an important lesson)

220
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:08,490
Everyone. I came back...

221
00:10:09,559 --> 00:10:12,500
to the streets of Varanasi.

222
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,270
It feels nice and familiar now.

223
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,500
(The streets of Varanasi
are still full of people.)

224
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,569
It's still lively.

225
00:10:18,069 --> 00:10:20,539
(Even in the middle
of so many people and cars,)

226
00:10:21,409 --> 00:10:24,539
(he can now walk calmly like a local.)

227
00:10:26,010 --> 00:10:28,480
(He's even taking time
to receive a street blessing.)

228
00:10:28,779 --> 00:10:30,020
(He's completely a local now.)

229
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:31,049
Thank you.

230
00:10:33,890 --> 00:10:35,189
Manikarnika.

231
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:39,860
(The largest shine of souls in Varanasi)

232
00:10:41,329 --> 00:10:43,130
Yes. I was told...

233
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:46,770
this was the largest
and most famous crematorium.

234
00:10:47,299 --> 00:10:50,939
The dead are entering.

235
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:53,010
- Just like that?
- Gosh.

236
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:54,709
It's on this small street.

237
00:10:54,709 --> 00:10:58,010
- The bodies kept coming in.
- I see.

238
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,449
That's so unfamiliar to us.

239
00:11:01,750 --> 00:11:04,279
(Carefully entering
behind the line of people)

240
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:06,689
Gosh. They just bring...

241
00:11:07,490 --> 00:11:10,620
the bodies in like that.

242
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:11,659
(Fascinated)

243
00:11:11,659 --> 00:11:14,090
Since the crematorium
is in the middle of the city,

244
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:15,529
just a few steps away...

245
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:18,299
I saw it a while back.

246
00:11:18,299 --> 00:11:21,900
I heard
a lot of people who are sick and old...

247
00:11:22,130 --> 00:11:25,439
live around here,

248
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:27,939
- waiting to die.
- I see.

249
00:11:28,309 --> 00:11:30,279
That's the best thing
children can do for their parents.

250
00:11:30,279 --> 00:11:31,340
I see.

251
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,179
Since it's a crematorium,

252
00:11:39,179 --> 00:11:41,490
- there's a bunch of wood.
- Oh, my.

253
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,959
The scale is very impressive.

254
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:46,360
Oh, I can see it.

255
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:48,659
(He can finally see the crematorium.)

256
00:11:49,630 --> 00:11:50,630
Oh, my eyes.

257
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:51,659
(There's so much smoke
right from the entrance.)

258
00:11:51,659 --> 00:11:52,699
Oh, gosh.

259
00:11:54,169 --> 00:11:55,199
Gosh.

260
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:57,740
They're cremating bodies there.

261
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,740
But...

262
00:12:00,610 --> 00:12:02,740
The smell is very smoky.

263
00:12:04,939 --> 00:12:06,850
(The Ganges)

264
00:12:06,850 --> 00:12:10,150
(A place where life and death meet)

265
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:13,350
(The place he wanted to visit the most)

266
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:17,459
(The starting point of his India trip)

267
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:31,400
(Sacred fires lit up here and there)

268
00:12:32,470 --> 00:12:35,169
(The final destination of a Hindu life)

269
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,850
(Manikarnika Crematorium,
the largest crematorium in Varanasi)

270
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:42,480
(A crematorium that represents Varanasi.
Thought to be built about 3,000 years ago)

271
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,579
- Three thousand years.
- Three thousand years.

272
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:44,919
- I see.
- Three thousand years.

273
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:47,990
Indians believe being cremated...

274
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,520
and having your ashes
scattered in the Ganges...

275
00:12:50,520 --> 00:12:52,620
will wash you of your sins
and free of you...

276
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:54,459
- from karma and reincarnation.
- I see.

277
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:57,459
It symbolizes
returning to your mother's arms.

278
00:12:57,459 --> 00:12:58,459
- I see.
- Interesting.

279
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:04,669
Gosh. Okay.

280
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,309
They're cremating bodies here.

281
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:14,449
(At a loss for words
upon witnessing this scene)

282
00:13:14,449 --> 00:13:17,020
Gosh. Are they almost done
with the cremation over there?

283
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:22,650
(Tourists who came to see
the crematorium up close)

284
00:13:26,390 --> 00:13:27,390
There is... Gosh.

285
00:13:28,890 --> 00:13:29,959
The heat.

286
00:13:30,699 --> 00:13:31,699
(Holding his breath)

287
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,600
I can't open my eyes.

288
00:13:34,699 --> 00:13:36,770
Gosh. The heat is insane.

289
00:13:37,799 --> 00:13:41,610
(The crematorium is full
of heat and smoke.)

290
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:44,140
Over there.

291
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:47,679
They're preparing to cremate
about three people.

292
00:13:48,679 --> 00:13:50,279
They don't show it here,

293
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:53,049
but you can see the faces and bodies...

294
00:13:53,049 --> 00:13:54,490
- of people being burned.
- Really?

295
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:58,189
- Gosh. It made me feel weird.
- That must feel weird.

296
00:14:00,059 --> 00:14:01,159
In the end...

297
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:06,029
There must be people who used to be rich
and people who used to be poor.

298
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,429
In the end, we're all the same.

299
00:14:08,429 --> 00:14:10,100
We just all turn into ash.

300
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:13,539
I wonder how I'd feel.

301
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:23,250
(Standing in front of the bodies
turning into handfuls of ash,)

302
00:14:24,549 --> 00:14:26,650
(his mind starts to feel complicated.)

303
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:27,789
It was very peculiar.

304
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:34,360
(A crematorium staff)

305
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:36,189
- How long does it take?
- Three hours.

306
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:37,230
Three hours.

307
00:14:37,230 --> 00:14:38,929
In three hours,
you turn into a handful of ash.

308
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:41,429
In three hours,
bodies don't burn up completely.

309
00:14:41,429 --> 00:14:43,770
With men, the breastbone is still there,
and with women, the hip bone may remain.

310
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:46,270
When the body first arrives
at the crematorium,

311
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:48,209
the family washes the body in the Ganges.

312
00:14:48,870 --> 00:14:50,880
It's for the last purification.

313
00:14:51,809 --> 00:14:53,209
Next, the family buys wood.

314
00:14:53,809 --> 00:14:56,110
They use the wood to make a bed
for the cremation.

315
00:14:56,110 --> 00:14:57,949
They lay the body down on the bed.

316
00:14:58,179 --> 00:14:59,720
Then the family starts the fire.

317
00:15:02,049 --> 00:15:03,659
We burn bodies for 24 hours a day.

318
00:15:03,659 --> 00:15:06,260
In one day, we cremate
around 200 to 300 bodies.

319
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:08,390
- Around 200 to 300?
- We burn in one day.

320
00:15:09,429 --> 00:15:11,429
So to burn all of those in one day,

321
00:15:11,900 --> 00:15:13,630
they run this place without breaks.

322
00:15:13,630 --> 00:15:15,230
(This place saw so many deaths
for the past thousands of years.)

323
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,909
After such a long life, you become ash...

324
00:15:19,909 --> 00:15:21,409
in three hours.

325
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:27,350
When you go on trips,
you usually see fascinating, fun,

326
00:15:27,350 --> 00:15:28,880
and cool things.

327
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:29,949
But this...

328
00:15:30,179 --> 00:15:35,150
Is it okay for me to come here
with such a light heart?

329
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:37,390
- That's how I felt. It was heavy.
- I see.

330
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,289
My heart felt heavy.

331
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:41,959
Right. This makes you feel reverent.

332
00:15:46,159 --> 00:15:47,929
It feels a bit empty. In three hours...

333
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:51,439
In three hours, you burn up into nothing.

334
00:15:52,939 --> 00:15:53,970
Well,

335
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:57,679
there isn't much to life.

336
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,179
There really isn't much, looking at this.

337
00:16:02,179 --> 00:16:03,449
(Life feels so empty
when faced with the greatness of death.)

338
00:16:03,819 --> 00:16:06,250
It makes me let go of things.

339
00:16:07,850 --> 00:16:09,789
(A while ago,
I heard Mr. Na Hoon A say...)

340
00:16:09,789 --> 00:16:10,789
(that he went to India...)

341
00:16:10,789 --> 00:16:13,590
(and saw people,
whether they were great or bad,)

342
00:16:13,590 --> 00:16:15,959
(be cremated and sent to the Ganges.)

343
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:19,500
(He said he cried his eyes out
while watching that.)

344
00:16:20,270 --> 00:16:22,470
(We just have to keep going forward.
Life is a picnic.)

345
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:24,439
(From "Life is a Picnic" by Na Hoon A)

346
00:16:26,740 --> 00:16:27,740
But I keep...

347
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,809
This is what I felt the most.

348
00:16:36,179 --> 00:16:39,620
While I'm alive,
I should either spend more...

349
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,090
- or earn more,
- Earn more.

350
00:16:41,750 --> 00:16:44,289
- so that I don't regret it when I die.
- Right.

351
00:16:44,289 --> 00:16:46,990
If I live so that my worst day
is the day that I die,

352
00:16:47,390 --> 00:16:48,760
I won't have any regrets.

353
00:16:49,289 --> 00:16:50,760
- So you don't have any regrets?
- Right.

354
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,329
Since I'm alive,

355
00:16:52,429 --> 00:16:54,199
- we have to live without regrets.
- Without regrets.

356
00:16:54,199 --> 00:16:56,230
Everyone regrets when they die.

357
00:16:56,230 --> 00:16:57,240
Right.

358
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:59,100
That was the most difficult.

359
00:16:59,439 --> 00:17:00,539
That's how I felt.

360
00:17:02,039 --> 00:17:03,309
I feel a bit strange.

361
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:05,010
(Promising to have
a life without regrets,)

362
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,179
I feel a bit weird.

363
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:07,650
(he walks around the crematorium.)

364
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:10,380
I was told they scatter the ashes here...

365
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,949
after the cremation.

366
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:14,419
Also,

367
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,819
the wood... Oh, my.

368
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,620
Gosh!

369
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:20,429
The wood... Oh, my.

370
00:17:20,429 --> 00:17:21,890
- What was that?
- Gosh!

371
00:17:21,890 --> 00:17:23,260
(He stepped in poop.)

372
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:24,459
(Cow poop)

373
00:17:24,459 --> 00:17:25,459
- What?
- What was that?

374
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,069
(He stepped in cow poop
during his life picnic.)

375
00:17:29,069 --> 00:17:30,970
I was being careful the whole time,
but I stepped on it there.

376
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:32,799
(Scrunching his face)

377
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,209
But since cows are sacred in India...

378
00:17:38,939 --> 00:17:39,980
Darn it!

379
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:42,279
- It's poop.
- Gosh.

380
00:17:42,279 --> 00:17:43,520
(Rubbing it off)

381
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:46,179
- Rubbing the poop off like that...
- It's sacred.

382
00:17:46,179 --> 00:17:47,350
(Quickly sending it back
into its mother's arms)

383
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:48,689
Sacred poop.

384
00:17:49,350 --> 00:17:50,360
Gosh.

385
00:17:51,289 --> 00:17:52,819
I was being so careful
about not stepping on it.

386
00:17:53,059 --> 00:17:54,360
You stepped on sacred poop.

387
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,929
(He kept feeling the emptiness of life.)

388
00:17:56,929 --> 00:17:58,159
(He recovered in an instant.)

389
00:17:58,159 --> 00:17:59,900
I don't think you've let things go yet.

390
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,600
Those were new shoes.

391
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,569
- Gosh.
- You're working so hard to clean them.

392
00:18:03,569 --> 00:18:05,400
- You're working so hard to clean them.
- He's shaking his legs like crazy.

393
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,069
Gosh. How funny.

394
00:18:07,069 --> 00:18:08,539
(After thoroughly checking
on the sacredness...)

395
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:11,279
- Okay. Back to being sacred.
- Right.

396
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,480
Be careful of poop.

397
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:15,880
I think everyone here
has risen above worldly things.

398
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:17,319
- Holy84.
- Holy84.

399
00:18:17,319 --> 00:18:20,189
I heard the cows eat...

400
00:18:21,419 --> 00:18:22,590
the flower necklaces.

401
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:25,059
(Try it.)

402
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:29,029
Hey.

403
00:18:29,029 --> 00:18:30,600
- Hey.
- Be careful.

404
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,100
- What's it doing?
- What?

405
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:34,100
It's because he didn't wash his pants.

406
00:18:35,570 --> 00:18:38,239
But cows are holy, so I can't do anything.

407
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:39,739
You darned dogs.

408
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:43,040
- "Holy?"
- What's wrong?

409
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,310
(The customers gathered
after hearing rumors of the holy place.)

410
00:18:44,310 --> 00:18:45,340
What is it?

411
00:18:46,009 --> 00:18:47,949
- What do you want? Tell me what you want.
- What does it want?

412
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:50,650
(He stinks of holiness.)

413
00:18:51,179 --> 00:18:53,519
Gosh, it's time to go and meet Ricky.

414
00:18:53,590 --> 00:18:54,689
- Bicky.
- Bicky.

415
00:18:54,689 --> 00:18:56,120
(It's Bicky!)

416
00:18:57,519 --> 00:19:00,590
(Where will he head to?)

417
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:03,800
- His boatman friend, Bicky.
- Yes.

418
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:07,269
Around 6:30 p.m. to 7:00 p.m.,
there's a ceremony. It's Ganga puja.

419
00:19:07,269 --> 00:19:08,969
- Puja.
- Yes.

420
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:10,269
- I will have to come later.
- Yes.

421
00:19:10,540 --> 00:19:11,699
I'm always here.

422
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:13,509
- I'll come here in my boat.
- Okay.

423
00:19:13,509 --> 00:19:15,370
- My boat will be here at 6:30 p.m.
- Okay.

424
00:19:15,370 --> 00:19:16,939
You can go to the ceremony.

425
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,409
Okay. I understand.

426
00:19:18,540 --> 00:19:20,009
- Do you understand? We're friends.
- Yes.

427
00:19:20,009 --> 00:19:21,009
Yes, friend.

428
00:19:21,709 --> 00:19:23,580
(He goes to the place he met Bicky.)

429
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:26,050
- It took about ten minutes to get there.
- Yes.

430
00:19:30,159 --> 00:19:32,659
(Loud)

431
00:19:32,659 --> 00:19:33,830
Gosh.

432
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:36,860
I think it's starting.

433
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,429
It already started.

434
00:19:38,429 --> 00:19:40,499
(It already started with the sunset.)

435
00:19:40,699 --> 00:19:42,229
The people are...

436
00:19:42,229 --> 00:19:43,840
(The locals are gathered together.)

437
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,669
(Kian84 does not have any friends,
but he is full of excitement.)

438
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,340
(Dancing)

439
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:57,380
(He moves forward with the beat.)

440
00:19:58,150 --> 00:20:00,650
(In order to see the arti puja,)

441
00:20:01,419 --> 00:20:05,489
(people have gathered at the ghat.)

442
00:20:07,759 --> 00:20:11,159
- Hi, Kian84.
- Oh, Ricky.

443
00:20:11,229 --> 00:20:12,860
- Hey.
- Oh, they met.

444
00:20:12,860 --> 00:20:13,870
(He meets Bicky within the crowd.)

445
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:16,030
- My boat is standing here.
- Okay.

446
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,939
It's very crowded here,
so we will go there and stand.

447
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:20,370
- Okay, Ricky.
- Come.

448
00:20:21,969 --> 00:20:23,439
- Are you enjoying it?
- What?

449
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,979
- Enjoy?
- Enjoy.

450
00:20:24,979 --> 00:20:26,009
Yes, very...

451
00:20:26,009 --> 00:20:29,580
- I saw a burning body.
- Burning?

452
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,719
- Yes.
- Yes.

453
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:32,080
A dead body on fire.

454
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,050
- My eyes hurt.
- I see.

455
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:35,519
- Because of the smoke.
- Yes.

456
00:20:37,219 --> 00:20:39,219
- What?
- What is it?

457
00:20:40,189 --> 00:20:41,790
(The reason why he was so shocked)

458
00:20:41,790 --> 00:20:43,259
This is the ceremony place.

459
00:20:43,259 --> 00:20:44,600
(Full of people)

460
00:20:44,699 --> 00:20:46,600
- Look at that crowd.
- Is that all people?

461
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:47,800
- Gosh.
- What?

462
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:48,900
Yes, that's right.

463
00:20:49,830 --> 00:20:51,499
- Look at the boats.
- The boats.

464
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,199
- Gosh, that's cool.
- Gosh.

465
00:20:57,479 --> 00:20:59,840
Puja means "service" in Hindi,

466
00:20:59,949 --> 00:21:02,110
and arti means "fire."

467
00:21:02,249 --> 00:21:05,179
It is a Hindu ceremony
where a fire is spun...

468
00:21:05,380 --> 00:21:07,719
and a memorial ceremony as an offering...

469
00:21:07,719 --> 00:21:09,050
to Mother Ganga of the Ganges.

470
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:12,820
(A festival of fire and water
for the deities)

471
00:21:12,959 --> 00:21:14,459
It is held for an hour every day...

472
00:21:14,459 --> 00:21:16,360
- after 6 p.m. with the sunset.
- Gosh.

473
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,330
- All these people gather every day?
- Every day.

474
00:21:19,929 --> 00:21:21,870
(It's the biggest and fanciest
holy ceremony.)

475
00:21:22,199 --> 00:21:24,669
(Arti puja)

476
00:21:24,739 --> 00:21:26,140
- All those people are there for that?
- So many people gather.

477
00:21:26,140 --> 00:21:27,409
- Yes, that's right.
- Yes.

478
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:30,110
- Traffic stops because of that.
- It's crazy.

479
00:21:30,479 --> 00:21:32,310
It's amazing how they get the boats there.

480
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:35,509
The Hindus come from all over...

481
00:21:35,509 --> 00:21:37,550
- just to see that.
- From all over the country.

482
00:21:37,650 --> 00:21:39,419
- They even come from the suburbs.
- A lot of people come.

483
00:21:40,620 --> 00:21:42,989
So this is the puja.

484
00:21:42,989 --> 00:21:45,959
- Gosh.
- Yes, puja means "Ganga puja."

485
00:21:46,259 --> 00:21:48,489
It's a festival.

486
00:21:50,459 --> 00:21:51,699
Gosh.

487
00:21:54,570 --> 00:21:56,969
On one side, people become...

488
00:21:57,600 --> 00:21:58,870
a handful of ashes.

489
00:21:58,870 --> 00:22:00,840
On the other side, festivals are held.

490
00:22:01,340 --> 00:22:04,110
- The Ganges has life and death.
- All the people here...

491
00:22:04,110 --> 00:22:06,540
All the people here are here
for the ceremony.

492
00:22:11,350 --> 00:22:14,919
- Is he the host?
- Host?

493
00:22:15,019 --> 00:22:16,890
- The priest.
- Is this the puja?

494
00:22:16,890 --> 00:22:19,790
- Oh, the priest.
- This is the place of the ceremony.

495
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:22,360
- Puja...
- Ganga puja.

496
00:22:22,459 --> 00:22:24,630
- Puja...
- Puja is "ceremony."

497
00:22:24,630 --> 00:22:27,030
- His name?
- Yes.

498
00:22:27,530 --> 00:22:29,800
Ganga puja. It is the ceremony.

499
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:31,300
(He repeats it like a chant.)

500
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:33,439
He just kept saying that.

501
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,610
Tell me something else
other than "Ganga puja."

502
00:22:38,040 --> 00:22:40,249
Look here. Come.

503
00:22:41,009 --> 00:22:42,709
- Shiva.
- Shiva.

504
00:22:42,979 --> 00:22:46,050
Shiva and his wife. She's Parvati.

505
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,790
Shiva is the deity,
and the mother is Parvati.

506
00:22:49,489 --> 00:22:50,919
The mother is Annapurna.

507
00:22:50,919 --> 00:22:52,790
- Oh, the...
- Annapurna.

508
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,959
- Shiva?
- Shiva.

509
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,459
- Shiva.
- Shiva.

510
00:22:56,590 --> 00:22:58,600
- She is ready.
- The rice deity?

511
00:22:58,959 --> 00:23:01,429
- The demolition deity?
- No, not demolition.

512
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:03,570
Who is he?
Why does he have such loving eyes?

513
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:05,769
- He has deep eyes.
- Okay.

514
00:23:05,769 --> 00:23:07,840
(He is watching with keen eyes.)

515
00:23:09,310 --> 00:23:10,580
I think he is the owner.

516
00:23:10,580 --> 00:23:12,140
- What should we do?
- Look now.

517
00:23:12,409 --> 00:23:14,850
- Ricky, is this your shop?
- No.

518
00:23:14,850 --> 00:23:16,249
- The owner is here.
- It is his.

519
00:23:16,249 --> 00:23:17,380
It was his shop.

520
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:18,519
Buy something then.

521
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:20,150
We need to buy something.

522
00:23:21,449 --> 00:23:22,890
- How much?
- It's 50 rupees.

523
00:23:22,890 --> 00:23:23,890
It's 50 rupees?

524
00:23:24,820 --> 00:23:27,429
- He couldn't just go.
- Right.

525
00:23:28,030 --> 00:23:29,090
Ganga puja.

526
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:32,060
- No thank you.
- Thank you.

527
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:33,729
Someone needs to stop him.

528
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:35,199
- He buys anything.
- He's getting mugged.

529
00:23:35,199 --> 00:23:36,229
Ricky.

530
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,269
(The shopping continues.)

531
00:23:39,469 --> 00:23:41,209
- This one.
- What is that?

532
00:23:41,209 --> 00:23:42,769
It's for the light.

533
00:23:42,769 --> 00:23:43,880
I see.

534
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,310
How much is it for two?

535
00:23:45,310 --> 00:23:46,439
It's 100 rupees.

536
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:48,679
It's 100 rupees for 2 of these?

537
00:23:49,110 --> 00:23:50,949
- It's 100 rupees for each, so 200 rupees?
- Yes, it's 200 rupees.

538
00:23:50,949 --> 00:23:52,519
Okay. Hold this.

539
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:56,290
(He buys everything
without thinking to bargain.)

540
00:23:56,290 --> 00:23:58,120
(Stopping)

541
00:23:59,459 --> 00:24:01,290
- Wait.
- You need to bargain.

542
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,290
(Will he finally bargain?)

543
00:24:02,729 --> 00:24:03,830
I will buy one more.

544
00:24:03,929 --> 00:24:04,999
What?

545
00:24:04,999 --> 00:24:06,560
You're getting one more
without bargaining?

546
00:24:07,699 --> 00:24:09,630
(The rich man opens his wallet.)

547
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:10,640
Three.

548
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,340
It's 1, 2, 3, 4.

549
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,439
- What?
- What?

550
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:16,880
Five...

551
00:24:17,939 --> 00:24:19,409
- Six...
- Six.

552
00:24:19,610 --> 00:24:20,679
- Seven...
- What?

553
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,949
- Eight...
- What?

554
00:24:23,209 --> 00:24:25,280
- Nine?
- Nine.

555
00:24:25,280 --> 00:24:27,650
Make it ten.

556
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,689
- Okay.
- What is she doing?

557
00:24:29,689 --> 00:24:31,290
(He got 10 pieces.)

558
00:24:31,290 --> 00:24:32,360
You bought one.

559
00:24:33,019 --> 00:24:34,229
Why is it ten?

560
00:24:34,229 --> 00:24:35,330
(He wanted 1, but got a basketful.)

561
00:24:35,330 --> 00:24:36,689
She's just adding more.

562
00:24:37,959 --> 00:24:40,370
(As a hearty buyer...)

563
00:24:40,630 --> 00:24:42,630
- Okay.
- It's 1,000 rupees?

564
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:44,600
It's only 16 dollars.

565
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:45,939
- "16 dollars?" Still...
- Thank you.

566
00:24:45,939 --> 00:24:47,239
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

567
00:24:47,239 --> 00:24:49,669
Do you know the actual price of that?

568
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:50,709
I don't.

569
00:24:50,810 --> 00:24:52,439
The actual price of that...

570
00:24:52,439 --> 00:24:53,850
It's 20 rupees.

571
00:24:53,850 --> 00:24:54,909
- What?
- Gosh...

572
00:24:55,749 --> 00:24:58,219
(He paid 5 times more, thinking of Korea.)

573
00:24:58,219 --> 00:24:59,949
- You had good intentions, though.
- Yes.

574
00:24:59,949 --> 00:25:01,050
Gosh.

575
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:02,249
(There, there.)

576
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,419
Listen, Ricky.

577
00:25:04,419 --> 00:25:06,320
- They are newly married.
- Married?

578
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:07,830
(They are getting married on the Ganges.)

579
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:09,330
- Married?
- Yes, newly married.

580
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:11,699
- Oh, congratulations.
- Thank you.

581
00:25:11,699 --> 00:25:13,459
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

582
00:25:13,459 --> 00:25:14,699
You are both good-looking.

583
00:25:15,330 --> 00:25:18,070
- Please be happy.
- Yes.

584
00:25:18,070 --> 00:25:20,140
- Yes, congratulations.
- Thank you.

585
00:25:20,140 --> 00:25:21,769
(He keeps blessing the newlyweds.)

586
00:25:21,969 --> 00:25:24,310
(Thank you)

587
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:25,739
Puja.

588
00:25:26,009 --> 00:25:27,509
Yes, puja.

589
00:25:27,509 --> 00:25:29,310
(He's excited in many ways.)

590
00:25:29,509 --> 00:25:32,519
(They arrive where Bicky's boat is.)

591
00:25:32,519 --> 00:25:34,919
(Staring)

592
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,419
- What?
- Are they customers?

593
00:25:38,519 --> 00:25:40,189
- Come here.
- Yes?

594
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:42,330
(Hesitating)

595
00:25:42,530 --> 00:25:44,800
- No problem. They are my friends.
- "Friends?"

596
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,360
- What?
- He made me ride with them.

597
00:25:46,360 --> 00:25:47,469
- Hello.
- My friends.

598
00:25:47,469 --> 00:25:49,100
He said they were his friends.

599
00:25:49,870 --> 00:25:51,239
Ricky's friends?

600
00:25:51,239 --> 00:25:52,969
- Yes.
- I see.

601
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,769
- Please take a seat.
- Yes.

602
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:59,140
- Are you married?
- Yes.

603
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,650
- Are you married?
- Yes.

604
00:26:00,949 --> 00:26:03,719
- Now? Did you marry yesterday?
- Married.

605
00:26:03,719 --> 00:26:05,979
- Eight years.
- Seven years ago?

606
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:08,120
- Yes.
- Get ready.

607
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,489
(He ends up going with the couple.)

608
00:26:09,489 --> 00:26:12,360
Oh, Marry... I mean Ricky...

609
00:26:12,790 --> 00:26:14,130
He made me join others.

610
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,560
He didn't mention this.

611
00:26:16,560 --> 00:26:17,659
(Joining single riders is the same
all over the world.)

612
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:20,330
This is awkward.

613
00:26:21,469 --> 00:26:24,140
(He does not know where to look.)

614
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:26,800
(Whatever)

615
00:26:27,310 --> 00:26:31,810
(The boat departs.)

616
00:26:34,949 --> 00:26:37,019
(It's open wide,)

617
00:26:37,019 --> 00:26:39,820
(but he can't breathe.)

618
00:26:39,820 --> 00:26:41,219
- What is that?
- What?

619
00:26:41,219 --> 00:26:42,650
They are also taken aback.

620
00:26:42,650 --> 00:26:44,620
(They are also taken aback...)

621
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,590
- He is nervous.
- You look like...

622
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:48,030
you're on a duck boat in Korea.

623
00:26:48,229 --> 00:26:50,229
He's alone with the life vest.

624
00:26:50,229 --> 00:26:51,659
I can't fall in the water.

625
00:26:51,659 --> 00:26:52,699
That's funny.

626
00:26:53,929 --> 00:26:56,969
(Things are getting quiet.)

627
00:26:57,400 --> 00:26:59,969
What's your name?

628
00:27:00,469 --> 00:27:01,769
My name is Kian84.

629
00:27:01,769 --> 00:27:02,870
- "Kian84?"
- "Kian84."

630
00:27:02,870 --> 00:27:04,509
I'm solo.

631
00:27:04,509 --> 00:27:06,810
- "Solo?"
- I'm solo.

632
00:27:06,939 --> 00:27:08,380
I have no girlfriend.

633
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,019
I'm not married.

634
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:12,820
- Not married?
- No.

635
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,290
Congratulations.

636
00:27:15,290 --> 00:27:16,820
(Laughing)

637
00:27:17,019 --> 00:27:18,219
What does that mean?

638
00:27:18,219 --> 00:27:20,759
- Indian humor.
- It's no joke.

639
00:27:20,759 --> 00:27:22,130
He has good taste.

640
00:27:22,130 --> 00:27:25,429
Why would you say that
in front of your wife?

641
00:27:25,499 --> 00:27:27,400
(Nervous)

642
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,630
You'll get in trouble.

643
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:30,640
(Laughing awkwardly)

644
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,769
Goodness.

645
00:27:34,009 --> 00:27:39,310
(It got even more awkward...)

646
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,249
- Your name?
- My name is Lohit.

647
00:27:42,249 --> 00:27:44,320
- Lohit.
- Yes.

648
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:45,820
- Name?
- Smita.

649
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,919
- Smita.
- Smita.

650
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:48,550
Do you like Varanasi?

651
00:27:48,550 --> 00:27:50,120
- What?
- Do you like Varanasi?

652
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,219
Varanasi? Oh, I like it.

653
00:27:52,989 --> 00:27:56,560
My mind closes up.

654
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,800
- My mind closes up.
- Close.

655
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,300
- I feel clean.
- It's "clean" not "close."

656
00:28:01,330 --> 00:28:04,140
It was on the bucket challenge of my life.

657
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:09,310
(It's a bucket challenge,
not bucket list?)

658
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,939
- "Bucket challenge?"
- What?

659
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:13,409
Oh, bucket list.

660
00:28:13,409 --> 00:28:15,249
- It's the ice bucket challenge.
- You're right.

661
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:17,780
- Bucket list.
- "Bucket challenge?"

662
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,120
- That's funny.
- Oh, bucket risk.

663
00:28:20,449 --> 00:28:21,489
Bucket list.

664
00:28:21,890 --> 00:28:23,860
Do you understand "bucket challenge?"

665
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:24,890
No.

666
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:29,759
I... Life... Hope... One...

667
00:28:30,429 --> 00:28:32,159
- I see.
- Oh.

668
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,630
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

669
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:35,570
Seeing this was my lifetime dream.

670
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,699
- It was one of my dreams.
- Okay.

671
00:28:40,610 --> 00:28:42,769
Why did you come here?

672
00:28:42,769 --> 00:28:43,840
Why?

673
00:28:44,009 --> 00:28:46,239
My sister is getting married,
so I'm here to pray.

674
00:28:46,239 --> 00:28:47,449
- Because of the wedding?
- That's it.

675
00:28:47,449 --> 00:28:49,350
- Sister.
- She's getting married tomorrow.

676
00:28:49,350 --> 00:28:50,419
- Tomorrow?
- Yes.

677
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:51,749
So you're here for the wedding?

678
00:28:52,050 --> 00:28:54,550
How old is your sister?

679
00:28:54,949 --> 00:28:56,519
She is 29 years old.

680
00:28:56,519 --> 00:28:57,919
- What?
- Twenty-nine years.

681
00:28:58,189 --> 00:28:59,259
Twenty-six?

682
00:29:00,360 --> 00:29:01,689
It's 5, 6, 7...

683
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:04,060
Oh, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...

684
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,560
And 7, 8, 9...

685
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:06,659
Oh, 29.

686
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:09,630
Will you attend any marriage in India?

687
00:29:10,699 --> 00:29:11,999
Any marry... What?

688
00:29:12,169 --> 00:29:13,340
- Any marriage.
- What?

689
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,239
- Any marriage.
- Gosh.

690
00:29:15,610 --> 00:29:18,009
I was always solo.

691
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:21,509
- What?
- Always.

692
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:23,550
- Oh, no.
- I had many girlfriends.

693
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:26,550
(I had many girlfriends,
but all broke up.)

694
00:29:26,550 --> 00:29:28,689
I'm saying I had girlfriends.

695
00:29:28,689 --> 00:29:30,249
- Past tense.
- Solo.

696
00:29:30,249 --> 00:29:31,489
You're a very nice guy.

697
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,759
He's going to get in trouble at home.

698
00:29:37,030 --> 00:29:39,900
I guess I'm making family troubles.

699
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,370
- Why does he keep saying...
- I don't have any girlfriends.

700
00:29:42,699 --> 00:29:44,999
- You?
- I don't have any girlfriends.

701
00:29:44,999 --> 00:29:46,269
Only her.

702
00:29:47,310 --> 00:29:49,870
(Hugging)

703
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:52,280
It's the same anywhere in the world.

704
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,780
(The festival continues
within the river of life and death.)

705
00:29:56,350 --> 00:30:00,790
(They focus with a devoted mind.)

706
00:30:01,489 --> 00:30:07,530
(The priest wakes the gods with the horn,)

707
00:30:08,959 --> 00:30:13,100
(and the fires are lit
to drive the bad spirits away.)

708
00:30:15,429 --> 00:30:18,469
It was too much like a party...

709
00:30:19,939 --> 00:30:21,739
to call it a religious ceremony.

710
00:30:21,739 --> 00:30:24,780
(It is like a festival.)

711
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,409
- There are many tourists as well.
- Yes.

712
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,650
Gosh.

713
00:30:30,650 --> 00:30:31,719
It's so big.

714
00:30:32,850 --> 00:30:35,150
I could not tell if I was dreaming or not.

715
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:36,419
(It breaks the boundaries...)

716
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:37,620
It's dreamy.

717
00:30:37,620 --> 00:30:39,919
(of dreams and reality.)

718
00:30:40,890 --> 00:30:45,100
(On one side, they gather wishes...)

719
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:48,900
(and set the flower lanterns afloat.)

720
00:30:51,669 --> 00:30:55,209
(Kian84 also lights up his lanterns.)

721
00:30:55,209 --> 00:30:56,239
Gosh, Ricky.

722
00:30:57,340 --> 00:30:59,310
- My hope...
- Yes.

723
00:30:59,310 --> 00:31:00,409
My hope.

724
00:31:01,310 --> 00:31:02,380
This is...

725
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:06,120
I'll set this to wish for this season...

726
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:07,850
- to be a success.
- Okay.

727
00:31:07,850 --> 00:31:09,449
- Thank you.
- Please let my wish come true.

728
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:26,499
And this is for my father up there.

729
00:31:26,499 --> 00:31:31,080
(The second wish is for
the well-being of his late father.)

730
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:34,409
(The third wish...)

731
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:38,019
I hope everything turns out well
for all my friends.

732
00:31:38,019 --> 00:31:39,880
(is for the future of his friends.)

733
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,090
(He puts his heart into the lanterns.)

734
00:31:44,590 --> 00:31:45,659
This...

735
00:31:45,659 --> 00:31:47,489
- Next time.
- Next time?

736
00:31:47,489 --> 00:31:49,560
The wind was too strong.

737
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,630
(The couple's turn.)

738
00:31:54,100 --> 00:31:58,969
(They wish for the happiness
of his engaged sister.)

739
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:04,679
(They flow with the Ganges river.)

740
00:32:04,679 --> 00:32:06,140
The many...

741
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:09,580
- Each one is a wish from the people.
- Yes.

742
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:11,820
(Gosh...)

743
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,880
What a sight.

744
00:32:14,449 --> 00:32:16,820
(Whispering)

745
00:32:17,120 --> 00:32:19,590
(Nodding)

746
00:32:24,259 --> 00:32:25,600
Kian84.

747
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:26,630
Yes?

748
00:32:26,900 --> 00:32:29,570
- This is my sister's wedding card.
- Oh.

749
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:31,140
Thank you.

750
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,469
- Your sister's?
- Gosh.

751
00:32:32,469 --> 00:32:33,800
- Marriage.
- Marry?

752
00:32:33,800 --> 00:32:35,810
- Yes.
- Yes. Can you come?

753
00:32:36,370 --> 00:32:37,739
- What?
- Amazing.

754
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:38,810
- He got invited.
- Gosh.

755
00:32:38,810 --> 00:32:40,179
- I was so shocked.
- Me?

756
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:41,380
- To the wedding?
- Yes.

757
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,179
(When he was headed
to Varanasi yesterday...)

758
00:32:45,249 --> 00:32:49,320
(He saw weddings here and there.)

759
00:32:50,189 --> 00:32:53,560
(It's like a club!)

760
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:56,060
(He was curious about the party.)

761
00:32:56,060 --> 00:32:57,800
You wanted to go.

762
00:32:58,229 --> 00:32:59,659
It was...

763
00:32:59,999 --> 00:33:01,199
- like a dream.
- Come.

764
00:33:01,199 --> 00:33:02,269
- Yes.
- Oh.

765
00:33:02,269 --> 00:33:04,070
- If you come,
- I'll think.

766
00:33:04,070 --> 00:33:06,439
- we will be happy.
- We will be happy.

767
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:07,870
- We will be happy if you come.
- Oh.

768
00:33:07,870 --> 00:33:09,709
How much is the congratulatory money?

769
00:33:10,439 --> 00:33:12,080
- "Congratulatory money?"
- How could you...

770
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,380
- ask that to their faces?
- "How much?"

771
00:33:14,610 --> 00:33:16,280
Congratulation...

772
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:17,280
No.

773
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,719
Okay, I will talk to my crew.

774
00:33:21,189 --> 00:33:22,390
- I will talk to them.
- Okay.

775
00:33:23,120 --> 00:33:24,390
I'm invited to a wedding tomorrow.

776
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:25,890
He's invited.

777
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:29,189
I had to ask the staff.

778
00:33:29,189 --> 00:33:30,830
You had other plans.

779
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:32,659
- What time is it?
- The time?

780
00:33:32,659 --> 00:33:34,630
- What time is she...
- It's 8 p.m.

781
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,900
- It's 8 p.m.
- It's 8 p.m.

782
00:33:35,900 --> 00:33:37,300
- It's 8 p.m.?
- Yes.

783
00:33:37,300 --> 00:33:38,300
Night?

784
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,400
- No, 8 p.m.
- At night.

785
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,570
- It's 8 p.m.?
- Night.

786
00:33:40,570 --> 00:33:41,769
- Night?
- Yes.

787
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:43,040
Night? Or 8 p.m.?

788
00:33:43,040 --> 00:33:44,179
- It's 8 p.m.
- What time?

789
00:33:44,179 --> 00:33:45,409
- It's 8 p.m.
- It's 8 p.m.

790
00:33:45,409 --> 00:33:48,150
- It's 8 p.m.?
- Yes.

791
00:33:48,749 --> 00:33:49,780
At night...

792
00:33:49,780 --> 00:33:51,780
(At night...)

793
00:33:51,780 --> 00:33:52,780
At 8 p.m.

794
00:33:52,979 --> 00:33:53,979
(Thinking)

795
00:33:53,979 --> 00:33:56,350
- It's 8 p.m. at night?
- Yes.

796
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:57,590
- It's 9 p.m.
- Yes.

797
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:59,219
It's 9 p.m.

798
00:33:59,219 --> 00:34:00,790
(Not 9 p.m., it is 8 p.m.)

799
00:34:00,959 --> 00:34:03,259
He's weak with numbers.

800
00:34:03,259 --> 00:34:05,330
- He's confused.
- I haven't used English...

801
00:34:05,330 --> 00:34:06,830
in about 3 or 4 years,

802
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:08,669
- It's been so long.
- I used it for three days...

803
00:34:08,669 --> 00:34:09,929
when I was in England last year,

804
00:34:09,929 --> 00:34:12,269
and I didn't use it again
for 6 or 7 months.

805
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,469
- It was confusing to use it again.
- It's confusing.

806
00:34:14,469 --> 00:34:16,169
- It is confusing.
- Of course, it is.

807
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:18,110
And it's so loud there.

808
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,780
(Laughing)

809
00:34:20,509 --> 00:34:22,850
Where is it?

810
00:34:24,219 --> 00:34:25,449
(He saves the spot on his map.)

811
00:34:25,449 --> 00:34:26,519
- Okay.
- Yes.

812
00:34:26,519 --> 00:34:27,590
- Okay.
- Okay?

813
00:34:27,590 --> 00:34:28,590
Okay.

814
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:31,790
At 8 p.m. I promise.

815
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:34,959
Indians are so...

816
00:34:34,959 --> 00:34:36,959
(Indians are so...)

817
00:34:36,959 --> 00:34:39,100
They are so warm-hearted.

818
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:40,769
They are Indian-hearted.

819
00:34:41,769 --> 00:34:44,939
They get attached quickly.

820
00:34:44,939 --> 00:34:46,140
They are warm-hearted.

821
00:34:47,810 --> 00:34:48,840
This is...

822
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:52,380
- Bye, Kian84.
- Bye.

823
00:34:54,810 --> 00:34:55,909
Here. Thank you.

824
00:34:56,409 --> 00:34:57,449
Thank you.

825
00:34:58,380 --> 00:34:59,719
- Bye.
- Bye.

826
00:35:00,380 --> 00:35:01,390
Gosh.

827
00:35:03,219 --> 00:35:04,590
(Groaning)

828
00:35:04,590 --> 00:35:05,590
Gosh.

829
00:35:06,759 --> 00:35:10,060
(He goes back to his room, groaning.)

830
00:35:10,429 --> 00:35:11,560
I'm so tired.

831
00:35:15,570 --> 00:35:18,400
(After waking up at 6 a.m.,)

832
00:35:18,999 --> 00:35:22,939
(he kept connecting with India.)

833
00:35:24,009 --> 00:35:27,310
(He became one with India,)

834
00:35:28,479 --> 00:35:34,650
(and naturally blended in
with the locals.)

835
00:35:37,919 --> 00:35:43,689
(For him to realize...)

836
00:35:43,689 --> 00:35:49,470
(the true meaning of life,)

837
00:35:50,599 --> 00:35:54,139
(the day was too long,
so he takes a rest.)

838
00:35:57,410 --> 00:35:58,610
(Sighing)

839
00:35:58,610 --> 00:35:59,639
What time is it?

840
00:36:03,749 --> 00:36:04,780
It's...

841
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:08,650
It's 8:17 p.m.

842
00:36:08,650 --> 00:36:09,720
It's been 14 hours.

843
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,990
The...

844
00:36:11,889 --> 00:36:13,459
I got...

845
00:36:13,889 --> 00:36:16,530
on a boat with a couple,

846
00:36:16,990 --> 00:36:19,559
and they gave me a wedding invitation.

847
00:36:20,329 --> 00:36:21,369
Do you see this?

848
00:36:21,930 --> 00:36:23,800
- It's so fancy.
- That's so cool.

849
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:24,869
It's amazing.

850
00:36:24,869 --> 00:36:27,639
How often would you get invited
to an Indian wedding?

851
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,709
Let me see.

852
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:32,479
Do you think India also has...

853
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:35,180
a standard to their wedding cards?

854
00:36:35,380 --> 00:36:36,749
As soon as you open it...

855
00:36:36,749 --> 00:36:39,280
"The two of us got together..."

856
00:36:39,820 --> 00:36:41,450
- You know how they are.
- "We will become one."

857
00:36:41,450 --> 00:36:42,519
It's a cliche.

858
00:36:43,419 --> 00:36:45,919
(What will the card look like?)

859
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:46,919
It's not like that.

860
00:36:47,419 --> 00:36:48,530
It's...

861
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:50,130
I wonder what it says.

862
00:36:50,430 --> 00:36:53,099
(He can't read it at all.)

863
00:36:53,099 --> 00:36:55,400
Gangnam Boutique...

864
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:57,470
Something... Cheongdam.

865
00:36:58,340 --> 00:37:00,169
And a brand name.

866
00:37:00,669 --> 00:37:03,039
It's cool to see an invitation card.

867
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,110
(He translates it to anything.)

868
00:37:04,110 --> 00:37:05,280
Let's go now.

869
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:08,280
And my overall impression is that...

870
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,680
life and death are the same.

871
00:37:10,809 --> 00:37:13,220
(He is left with the feeling
of remorse for life.)

872
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:15,349
That's what I'm thinking.

873
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:17,150
I will die one day as well.

874
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,260
We all die if we're born.

875
00:37:19,619 --> 00:37:21,630
(It is so drastic.)

876
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,660
It occurs to me that
I should enjoy good food,

877
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:27,530
do what I like,
and live without regrets...

878
00:37:27,530 --> 00:37:29,570
until the day I die.

879
00:37:31,169 --> 00:37:33,400
Yes, that's it for today.

880
00:37:38,139 --> 00:37:43,380
(He leaves behind today,
which will become yesterday.)

881
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:50,990
(Still...)

882
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,789
Weddings...

883
00:37:53,789 --> 00:37:55,829
bring new life,

884
00:37:56,630 --> 00:37:58,900
and funerals send away life.

885
00:37:58,900 --> 00:38:01,630
- They all happen in one place.
- Yes.

886
00:38:01,930 --> 00:38:03,369
I guess it makes you think.

887
00:38:03,369 --> 00:38:04,769
- It left many feelings.
- Yes.

888
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:10,110
(He is left in his thoughts...)

889
00:38:11,439 --> 00:38:13,380
(Slowly...)

890
00:38:14,139 --> 00:38:15,150
(What?)

891
00:38:15,610 --> 00:38:17,510
(Dex)

892
00:38:43,710 --> 00:38:45,150
- Gosh. At last.
- You startled me.

893
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,480
- Gosh.
- He's finally here.

894
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,119
- I was so happy to see him.
- You're here.

895
00:38:48,889 --> 00:38:50,319
When did you get here?

896
00:38:50,489 --> 00:38:51,920
I landed here today.

897
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:52,989
(Today!)

898
00:38:54,290 --> 00:38:57,060
(The intense warrior
and the former soldier of UDT)

899
00:38:58,130 --> 00:38:59,460
(This fierce beast
doesn't back down to anyone.)

900
00:38:59,460 --> 00:39:01,369
That gaze was no joke.

901
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,569
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

902
00:39:04,469 --> 00:39:06,600
It feels weird
to watch my clips like this.

903
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:08,770
- Gosh.
- Dex!

904
00:39:09,639 --> 00:39:12,839
(The perfect example of a manly beast)

905
00:39:12,839 --> 00:39:15,580
(But in real life, he's the perfect
example of a clumsy traveler?)

906
00:39:16,810 --> 00:39:18,619
(Why is Dex so clumsy?
A handsome version of Kian84.)

907
00:39:18,619 --> 00:39:20,650
A handsome version of Kian84.
That's where it started.

908
00:39:20,650 --> 00:39:21,850
(I want them to battle it out to see
which one of them is more carefree.)

909
00:39:22,420 --> 00:39:25,889
Personally, I'm a fan of Kian84's.

910
00:39:25,889 --> 00:39:28,159
Well, I saw him run to places.

911
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:30,429
Then he ate, washed up, and went to sleep.

912
00:39:30,429 --> 00:39:32,860
- He ran again the next day.
- Right.

913
00:39:32,860 --> 00:39:34,900
I was born into this world.

914
00:39:34,900 --> 00:39:36,699
So I want to live my life the way I want.

915
00:39:36,699 --> 00:39:39,440
And he wants to follow his heart
to live his life.

916
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:42,339
I totally understand that
and respect him for it.

917
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,839
I can support him from behind.

918
00:39:46,279 --> 00:39:48,350
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

919
00:39:48,509 --> 00:39:50,819
- It's an honor. I'm a fan of yours.
- I see.

920
00:39:50,819 --> 00:39:52,080
- Really?
- Yes.

921
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:53,650
- "Let's go on a trip abroad."
- Yes.

922
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:55,250
"We'll figure it out."

923
00:39:55,250 --> 00:39:56,520
- That's nice.
- So...

924
00:39:56,520 --> 00:39:58,790
- I work out at the gym.
- Let's work out together.

925
00:39:58,790 --> 00:40:00,560
- You share a lot in common.
- Right.

926
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:01,960
He and I are similar in many ways.

927
00:40:02,190 --> 00:40:04,500
- He's such a cool guy.
- Gosh, no.

928
00:40:05,299 --> 00:40:08,170
Let's go to India together.

929
00:40:08,500 --> 00:40:09,730
We're all going?

930
00:40:09,869 --> 00:40:12,000
The first week of May.

931
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:15,069
I can't go on a trip that week.
I can go in the second week.

932
00:40:15,069 --> 00:40:16,369
- I see. Really?
- Yes.

933
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:18,739
(After Kian84's departure)

934
00:40:19,810 --> 00:40:21,009
What? Gosh.

935
00:40:21,250 --> 00:40:23,549
- Hello. I'm Dex.
- This became a different show.

936
00:40:23,679 --> 00:40:24,819
What? He and I look about the same.

937
00:40:24,819 --> 00:40:25,880
(Pouting)

938
00:40:25,980 --> 00:40:28,619
I'm at Incheon International Airport now.

939
00:40:28,619 --> 00:40:31,860
Kian84 has no idea that
I will be joining him.

940
00:40:32,290 --> 00:40:34,529
- Did Dex join you...
- Yes.

941
00:40:34,529 --> 00:40:37,029
earlier than scheduled?

942
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:41,170
Right. I was supposed
to join him rather late.

943
00:40:41,170 --> 00:40:44,170
We talked briefly about the trip
when we first met.

944
00:40:44,170 --> 00:40:47,639
I thought that he easily got lonely.

945
00:40:47,639 --> 00:40:49,540
I was worried about him.

946
00:40:49,540 --> 00:40:50,940
Gosh, why did you worry about me?

947
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:52,040
(But deep down, he's happy about it.)

948
00:40:52,679 --> 00:40:54,509
I can't wait to see his reaction...

949
00:40:54,509 --> 00:40:57,420
when I show up in front of him
in India out of the blue.

950
00:40:59,319 --> 00:41:00,719
(Incheon)

951
00:41:00,719 --> 00:41:02,690
(New Delhi)

952
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:04,889
(Varanasi)

953
00:41:05,719 --> 00:41:07,529
- Thank you. Bye.
- Bye.

954
00:41:07,529 --> 00:41:08,690
(He walked all day...)

955
00:41:08,690 --> 00:41:10,589
(and walked some more.)

956
00:41:11,199 --> 00:41:13,560
(He finally spotted Kian84's back.)

957
00:41:14,369 --> 00:41:16,230
Gosh. I'm nervous.

958
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:19,600
(Stop pounding, my heart.)

959
00:41:19,869 --> 00:41:21,310
Hey, your muscles have gotten harder.

960
00:41:21,310 --> 00:41:23,239
- Gosh, Kian84.
- What?

961
00:41:23,469 --> 00:41:24,679
Didn't you miss me?

962
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:26,980
- Actually,
- I didn't get to look around yet.

963
00:41:26,980 --> 00:41:28,610
- I was bored.
- Were you very bored?

964
00:41:28,610 --> 00:41:29,679
Yes.

965
00:41:29,750 --> 00:41:31,819
It's nice to see you.

966
00:41:32,250 --> 00:41:34,520
- Why did you get more muscles?
- No.

967
00:41:34,650 --> 00:41:37,989
(The muscular beast acts cute.)

968
00:41:37,989 --> 00:41:39,360
(Chuckling embarrassingly)

969
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:40,690
Here's the thing.

970
00:41:40,690 --> 00:41:43,290
Well, I also felt...

971
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:45,730
I was surrounded by crowds of people
on my way here.

972
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,969
Everyone was looking at me.

973
00:41:48,069 --> 00:41:50,739
Everything was unfamiliar.
The environment and the smell.

974
00:41:50,739 --> 00:41:52,369
After being in an unfamiliar environment,

975
00:41:52,369 --> 00:41:54,239
I felt a sense of anxiety.

976
00:41:54,440 --> 00:41:56,770
When I saw a familiar face here,

977
00:41:56,969 --> 00:41:58,580
I was so happy to see him.

978
00:41:58,580 --> 00:42:02,279
I naturally acted friendly
and whined a bit to him.

979
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,409
You were happy to see him.

980
00:42:03,409 --> 00:42:05,279
- How was it when you saw Dex?
- I was thrilled to see him.

981
00:42:05,279 --> 00:42:07,650
Gosh. Yes. Here's how I felt.

982
00:42:08,089 --> 00:42:11,719
I didn't meet any Koreans
after arriving in India.

983
00:42:12,060 --> 00:42:15,159
Part of me felt empty inside.

984
00:42:15,230 --> 00:42:17,159
- That's when he showed up.
- You were happy to see him.

985
00:42:17,159 --> 00:42:18,159
(Dex was a good friend
who made him feel less lonely.)

986
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:21,429
Hold on. Let's book a room.

987
00:42:21,429 --> 00:42:22,630
- Wait.
- Let me unload this somewhere.

988
00:42:22,630 --> 00:42:24,739
- Do you know how heavy this is?
- Did you come here from the airport?

989
00:42:24,739 --> 00:42:26,270
- Yes, I did.
- What's that?

990
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:27,810
Is that from the military?

991
00:42:27,869 --> 00:42:31,239
Yes. A senior soldier of mine
gave this to me as a present.

992
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:32,380
- Is that so?
- Gosh.

993
00:42:33,310 --> 00:42:36,009
Hey, are you on your way to some training?

994
00:42:36,009 --> 00:42:37,150
Why did you bring so much?

995
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:40,020
(The size of the backpack
awakens his challenging spirit.)

996
00:42:40,020 --> 00:42:42,089
Did you bring this to work out?

997
00:42:42,219 --> 00:42:44,190
No. Not at all. I'm serious.

998
00:42:44,360 --> 00:42:45,960
Hey, this must weigh over 20kg.

999
00:42:46,259 --> 00:42:47,830
Hey, this must weigh over 20kg.

1000
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,529
It does weigh over 20kg.

1001
00:42:49,529 --> 00:42:51,000
(His bird-like legs wobble
at the weight of the backpack.)

1002
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,630
- Hey, are you moving here?
- Where are we going?

1003
00:42:53,630 --> 00:42:55,270
- Be my guide.
- Are you moving here?

1004
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:57,130
- No.
- Why did you pack so much?

1005
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,500
I'm curious about
what he packed in the backpack.

1006
00:42:59,500 --> 00:43:01,739
- Right.
- I thought Pani Bottle was in that.

1007
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,909
He didn't pack as much as
Si Eon did in the first season.

1008
00:43:04,909 --> 00:43:06,179
No. It was heavier.

1009
00:43:06,509 --> 00:43:08,650
- It was heavier?
- His bag weighed less than 20kg.

1010
00:43:09,250 --> 00:43:11,420
Dex's backpack
must have weighed about 38kg.

1011
00:43:11,520 --> 00:43:12,719
Really?

1012
00:43:13,179 --> 00:43:14,989
I had never been to India before.

1013
00:43:14,989 --> 00:43:16,750
I didn't know what to expect there.

1014
00:43:16,750 --> 00:43:18,889
So I prepared a lot of things
before going there.

1015
00:43:18,889 --> 00:43:21,659
I see. You packed that much to survive.

1016
00:43:22,029 --> 00:43:23,190
We have to go that way.

1017
00:43:23,259 --> 00:43:24,360
- Then...
- You should carry that instead.

1018
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,529
- What's this?
- That's my stuff.

1019
00:43:26,529 --> 00:43:28,299
What's this? Did you buy this basket?

1020
00:43:28,299 --> 00:43:30,100
- Of course. A wedding invitation.
- What's this?

1021
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:31,400
- What's this?
- A wedding invitation.

1022
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,440
- That's important.
- The wedding invitation.

1023
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:34,540
A wedding invitation. Hey,
we're going to a wedding tomorrow.

1024
00:43:34,540 --> 00:43:36,040
"We're going to a wedding tomorrow."

1025
00:43:36,040 --> 00:43:38,810
- Really? A wedding invitation?
- Yes.

1026
00:43:40,139 --> 00:43:41,409
- All of a sudden?
- Yes.

1027
00:43:41,909 --> 00:43:44,179
Who on earth gave you this invitation?

1028
00:43:44,179 --> 00:43:46,020
- What? I met them today.
- Seriously.

1029
00:43:46,020 --> 00:43:47,350
- Really?
- Yes.

1030
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:49,750
- Hey, this is...
- How is it?

1031
00:43:49,850 --> 00:43:51,190
Dex. This...

1032
00:43:51,619 --> 00:43:52,920
Why did you bring so much stuff?

1033
00:43:53,259 --> 00:43:55,130
Did you pack metal tools?
You brought dumbbells, right?

1034
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:57,429
- No. I couldn't even pack...
- You...

1035
00:43:57,429 --> 00:43:59,130
- everything I wanted.
- To work out?

1036
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,259
This is crazy.

1037
00:44:00,259 --> 00:44:02,100
- Doesn't it feel like it weighs 30kg?
- Yes.

1038
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:03,100
(They go back to the lodging
as they work out.)

1039
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:05,369
- How much longer do we have to walk?
- What?

1040
00:44:05,369 --> 00:44:07,710
- We're almost there.
- I don't have a problem walking around.

1041
00:44:08,069 --> 00:44:09,710
Hey, how did you walk here
with this backpack?

1042
00:44:10,339 --> 00:44:12,279
- This is the place.
- By the way, I felt reassured...

1043
00:44:12,279 --> 00:44:13,380
- when Dex came.
- Okay.

1044
00:44:14,779 --> 00:44:16,049
This place looks nice.

1045
00:44:16,279 --> 00:44:18,279
- Hello.
- Hey, it smells great in here.

1046
00:44:18,279 --> 00:44:19,750
Yes. Hello.

1047
00:44:19,850 --> 00:44:21,949
- Hello.
- I'm...

1048
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:25,460
Room. One room.

1049
00:44:25,460 --> 00:44:26,460
- One room?
- Yes.

1050
00:44:26,460 --> 00:44:28,489
Sorry. Today, we're all booked.

1051
00:44:28,489 --> 00:44:29,759
- What?
- What?

1052
00:44:29,759 --> 00:44:31,400
But you have a room, right?

1053
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,259
My room has two beds,
but they are placed side by side.

1054
00:44:33,259 --> 00:44:35,299
- Really?
- And I snore too.

1055
00:44:35,299 --> 00:44:37,270
It's okay. I expected that.
So I packed earplugs.

1056
00:44:37,270 --> 00:44:39,100
- Really?
- I packed everything.

1057
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:40,400
I was surprised by that.

1058
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,670
- You can't snore that loudly.
- Okay.

1059
00:44:42,670 --> 00:44:44,179
- Then...
- Together.

1060
00:44:44,179 --> 00:44:46,639
- Okay. One person...
- One... Okay.

1061
00:44:46,639 --> 00:44:48,310
- Yes, you can.
- Okay.

1062
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,049
- How do you say that? Room service?
- We're brothers.

1063
00:44:51,250 --> 00:44:53,020
- Room service.
- Menu.

1064
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:54,319
- Menu?
- Menu, please.

1065
00:44:54,589 --> 00:44:55,889
Hey, you should eat something.

1066
00:44:55,889 --> 00:44:57,520
- Hey, I should eat something too.
- Chicken?

1067
00:44:57,520 --> 00:44:58,719
- Yes, we have it.
- I'm hungry.

1068
00:44:58,719 --> 00:44:59,960
- Chicken?
- Yes.

1069
00:45:00,119 --> 00:45:01,790
You should order some food you want here.

1070
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:05,199
I hate the strong smell.

1071
00:45:06,659 --> 00:45:08,369
(Munching and groaning)

1072
00:45:08,369 --> 00:45:09,869
He can act too.

1073
00:45:09,869 --> 00:45:12,440
This guy was a picky eater.

1074
00:45:12,540 --> 00:45:15,170
- Normal. Can you recommend a dish?
- How? Which dish?

1075
00:45:15,170 --> 00:45:16,569
- Like...
- A dish without spices.

1076
00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:18,639
- Chicken butter masala.
- Not a lot of spices?

1077
00:45:18,639 --> 00:45:20,580
- Okay. This one.
- This one.

1078
00:45:20,580 --> 00:45:23,580
And two bowls of rice.

1079
00:45:23,580 --> 00:45:24,750
- Two. Okay.
- Yes.

1080
00:45:26,520 --> 00:45:27,619
(Groaning)

1081
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:30,850
- I'll carry it from here.
- Can you get that?

1082
00:45:31,460 --> 00:45:32,989
It's heavy even for me.

1083
00:45:32,989 --> 00:45:34,330
(They switch bags.)

1084
00:45:34,960 --> 00:45:37,429
- Menu... Yes.
- Okay.

1085
00:45:37,429 --> 00:45:39,029
- Okay.
- Please hurry.

1086
00:45:39,929 --> 00:45:41,230
No elevator?

1087
00:45:41,500 --> 00:45:42,969
- No elevator.
- No elevator.

1088
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:44,639
Okay.

1089
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:47,540
- Come here.
- Okay.

1090
00:45:47,770 --> 00:45:49,239
- The air conditioner.
- It's cool in here.

1091
00:45:49,710 --> 00:45:50,710
It's nice.

1092
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,580
- This is nice.
- Yes.

1093
00:45:53,179 --> 00:45:54,310
By the way,

1094
00:45:54,710 --> 00:45:55,710
I feel bad to say it.

1095
00:45:55,710 --> 00:45:56,980
- But it's humid inside.
- Right?

1096
00:45:57,350 --> 00:45:58,949
(Changing his stance in 1 second)

1097
00:45:58,949 --> 00:46:01,690
I'll try not to cross the line here.

1098
00:46:01,690 --> 00:46:05,190
What? No. That's not what I meant.

1099
00:46:05,719 --> 00:46:08,089
(Chuckling)

1100
00:46:08,429 --> 00:46:10,130
Can we keep watching this?

1101
00:46:11,199 --> 00:46:13,500
- What's this on your pants?
- What?

1102
00:46:13,500 --> 00:46:15,869
Are these pants the forest edition?
What's this?

1103
00:46:15,869 --> 00:46:18,369
- Did some stuff get on my pants?
- Your bed...

1104
00:46:18,369 --> 00:46:20,600
- The bed? Let me see.
- Your bed...

1105
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:21,770
What's this?

1106
00:46:21,909 --> 00:46:23,940
- Gosh. What is this?
- What is that?

1107
00:46:24,210 --> 00:46:25,610
(Dusting)

1108
00:46:25,610 --> 00:46:27,279
What is all this?

1109
00:46:27,540 --> 00:46:30,080
- My goodness. Wait. Did I get that too?
- Wait.

1110
00:46:30,179 --> 00:46:31,250
- Not me.
- Tomorrow...

1111
00:46:32,119 --> 00:46:33,520
Wait. Tomorrow...

1112
00:46:33,949 --> 00:46:35,750
(Thinking)

1113
00:46:36,889 --> 00:46:38,759
Hey, is there anything
you want to do in India?

1114
00:46:39,389 --> 00:46:40,790
To be honest,

1115
00:46:41,429 --> 00:46:43,460
I don't have a grand goal or anything.

1116
00:46:43,929 --> 00:46:45,900
The Himalayas are in India.

1117
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:49,270
- The Himalayas.
- But the Himalayas...

1118
00:46:49,270 --> 00:46:50,270
(Chuckling)

1119
00:46:50,799 --> 00:46:53,299
- No, the Himalayas...
- I didn't serve in the special forces.

1120
00:46:53,299 --> 00:46:55,110
- I might die.
- No.

1121
00:46:55,110 --> 00:46:57,009
- I can't climb the Himalayas either.
- Okay.

1122
00:46:57,139 --> 00:46:59,679
- I just want to look at the Himalayas.
- Okay.

1123
00:46:59,679 --> 00:47:01,250
- I want to see the range with my eyes.
- Okay.

1124
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:03,610
I want to realize once again...

1125
00:47:03,610 --> 00:47:05,350
by looking at Mother Nature that...

1126
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:07,279
- humans are nothing compared to nature.
- Okay.

1127
00:47:08,350 --> 00:47:11,219
(Dex wants to experience the wild
with every part of his body...)

1128
00:47:12,159 --> 00:47:15,589
(in the off-the-beaten track,
free of any visitors.)

1129
00:47:16,389 --> 00:47:18,199
Let me tell you want what I want to do.

1130
00:47:18,199 --> 00:47:20,259
I wouldn't mind going to the wedding.

1131
00:47:20,259 --> 00:47:21,699
Here's a thing. It's a party.

1132
00:47:21,699 --> 00:47:22,770
At night?

1133
00:47:22,770 --> 00:47:26,270
They dance at the wedding.
It's a big festival.

1134
00:47:26,869 --> 00:47:29,270
(Dancing)

1135
00:47:29,969 --> 00:47:32,610
(Kian84 wants to dive
into the local scene...)

1136
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:37,279
(and experience life alongside them.)

1137
00:47:39,080 --> 00:47:42,489
Then you don't have any plans
for tomorrow. Right?

1138
00:47:42,589 --> 00:47:43,750
- Other than the wedding, right?
- Tomorrow...

1139
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:45,259
In the morning,

1140
00:47:45,460 --> 00:47:48,730
I befriended a guy,
and he told me there was a gym here.

1141
00:47:48,730 --> 00:47:50,389
A gym. Yes.

1142
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:52,199
Do you want to work out
with muscular guys in India?

1143
00:47:52,560 --> 00:47:54,630
Then let's work out tomorrow.

1144
00:47:54,630 --> 00:47:56,830
Let's work out intensely for 2 to 3 hours.

1145
00:47:56,830 --> 00:47:58,600
(Laughing)

1146
00:47:58,799 --> 00:48:00,270
- Then we can rest.
- Okay.

1147
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:01,469
- Take a rest.
- Okay.

1148
00:48:01,469 --> 00:48:03,469
- We can eat as we rest up.
- Okay.

1149
00:48:03,639 --> 00:48:06,679
Then we can dress up nicely at night.

1150
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:07,909
We can go to the wedding.

1151
00:48:07,909 --> 00:48:08,980
Okay.

1152
00:48:09,310 --> 00:48:12,250
I didn't have any plans the next day,
but my day was fully booked.

1153
00:48:12,850 --> 00:48:15,150
(Their day became packed
as they shared their hobbies.)

1154
00:48:15,650 --> 00:48:17,350
When will Pani Bottle get here?

1155
00:48:17,350 --> 00:48:19,259
I couldn't talk to Pani Bottle at all.

1156
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:21,659
- He's coming, right?
- I think so.

1157
00:48:21,659 --> 00:48:22,690
But I'm not sure.

1158
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:24,860
I watched his YouTube video.
He was in Japan now.

1159
00:48:24,860 --> 00:48:26,259
- He's in Japan now?
- Yes.

1160
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:27,699
Should we call him?

1161
00:48:28,299 --> 00:48:30,429
Pani Bottle has been distant lately.

1162
00:48:30,429 --> 00:48:32,900
- He's acting like a celebrity now.
- He's a celebrity now.

1163
00:48:33,369 --> 00:48:34,940
Pani Bottle is so busy.

1164
00:48:34,940 --> 00:48:36,639
(There's Pani Bottle behind Jae Seok.)

1165
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,679
- You're video calling him?
- I should shave.

1166
00:48:42,580 --> 00:48:43,980
(Trying to video call a celebrity)

1167
00:48:43,980 --> 00:48:45,049
- Gosh.
- He answered it.

1168
00:48:45,049 --> 00:48:46,980
- Hello.
- How's the hotel?

1169
00:48:47,719 --> 00:48:50,020
(Pani Bottle, the familiar face,
shows up.)

1170
00:48:50,020 --> 00:48:51,560
You're the last one now.

1171
00:48:52,190 --> 00:48:53,659
I'll be there soon.

1172
00:48:53,659 --> 00:48:56,860
I will land there
in the afternoon on May 5.

1173
00:48:56,860 --> 00:48:58,630
- You'll be here in 2 days?
- I'll be there in 2 days.

1174
00:48:58,630 --> 00:48:59,929
Okay.

1175
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:01,029
We just have to wait two days.

1176
00:49:01,029 --> 00:49:03,069
- I mean, you're busy these days.
- Okay.

1177
00:49:03,069 --> 00:49:04,469
It's not easy to see you these days.

1178
00:49:04,469 --> 00:49:07,639
- I'm not busy at all.
- Okay.

1179
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:09,610
I'm rarely in Korea. That's it.

1180
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:11,610
- It's the same thing. What's he saying?
- Doesn't that mean he's busy?

1181
00:49:12,139 --> 00:49:13,980
And he's not here even today.

1182
00:49:13,980 --> 00:49:15,049
Hold on.

1183
00:49:15,049 --> 00:49:17,150
- And we're filming in his house too.
- Right.

1184
00:49:17,150 --> 00:49:18,880
- Where is he?
- Only he's not here.

1185
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:20,679
He's in Indonesia right now.

1186
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:21,989
Gosh. Now?

1187
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:23,920
No, listen.

1188
00:49:24,250 --> 00:49:25,589
- I'll be going to Delhi.
- Yes.

1189
00:49:25,589 --> 00:49:26,589
You must meet me there.

1190
00:49:26,589 --> 00:49:28,659
I'll be arriving in Delhi.
We need to meet up there.

1191
00:49:29,029 --> 00:49:31,060
- In front of Delhi Station,
- Yes.

1192
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,360
there's a model train.

1193
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:33,659
Around the time you get off,

1194
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:35,869
I'll pick you up there.
Just let me know when you'd get off.

1195
00:49:35,869 --> 00:49:37,600
- Really?
- In Delhi. Yes.

1196
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:38,869
Okay.

1197
00:49:38,869 --> 00:49:41,339
By the way, Pani Bottle is amazing.

1198
00:49:41,339 --> 00:49:43,569
- He goes abroad all the time.
- Okay.

1199
00:49:43,770 --> 00:49:45,880
Let's say we're in India.
Or South America.

1200
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:47,739
- He knows everything?
- You know how it feels?

1201
00:49:47,739 --> 00:49:49,449
Let's say I live in Suwon.

1202
00:49:49,449 --> 00:49:51,420
"I'll pick you up at Suwon Station."
That's how it felt.

1203
00:49:51,420 --> 00:49:53,119
- "I'll see you at Delhi Station."
- I see.

1204
00:49:53,119 --> 00:49:54,380
- That must have felt reassuring.
- Right.

1205
00:49:54,380 --> 00:49:57,449
If you get lost abroad,

1206
00:49:57,449 --> 00:49:59,360
- Call Pani Bottle?
- call him.

1207
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:01,489
- He'll pick you up like it's no big deal.
- Ask him to meet you somewhere.

1208
00:50:02,489 --> 00:50:03,759
- In two days.
- See you in a few days.

1209
00:50:03,759 --> 00:50:04,929
- In 2 days.
- In 2 days.

1210
00:50:04,929 --> 00:50:06,100
- Bye.
- Goodnight.

1211
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:08,170
- Okay.
- Bye.

1212
00:50:08,170 --> 00:50:09,600
(They look forward
to gathering the entire group together.)

1213
00:50:11,069 --> 00:50:12,400
(Glancing)

1214
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:15,869
- Wait. Don't tell me this is yours.
- But...

1215
00:50:15,869 --> 00:50:18,440
That's it. I can't carry a lot of stuff.

1216
00:50:18,440 --> 00:50:20,440
- This is all you brought?
- This is it.

1217
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:22,409
- What?
- I was shocked at that moment.

1218
00:50:23,310 --> 00:50:24,380
This is all I have.

1219
00:50:24,779 --> 00:50:26,980
How could this be it? What did you bring?

1220
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:29,350
Clothes, medicine, and a few other things.

1221
00:50:29,350 --> 00:50:30,389
You must be lying.

1222
00:50:30,819 --> 00:50:31,819
Let me see yours.

1223
00:50:31,819 --> 00:50:33,889
- Do you want to see what I packed?
- Let's see.

1224
00:50:34,259 --> 00:50:37,259
I'm sure you'll find a present
you will like from my backpack.

1225
00:50:37,259 --> 00:50:39,029
- I have no doubt.
- Okay.

1226
00:50:39,029 --> 00:50:41,369
- I'm curious. "What's in my bag?"
- Yes, I'm very curious.

1227
00:50:41,529 --> 00:50:43,799
Let's see. The first item is...

1228
00:50:45,569 --> 00:50:48,569
the pair of slippers from Korean Air.

1229
00:50:48,869 --> 00:50:50,509
You brought the most useless stuff.

1230
00:50:51,940 --> 00:50:53,610
The slippers and the eyepatch.

1231
00:50:53,839 --> 00:50:55,179
Take out something we would need.

1232
00:50:55,179 --> 00:50:56,750
I need this.

1233
00:50:56,750 --> 00:50:59,179
- You can have it then.
- I need this.

1234
00:50:59,179 --> 00:51:00,219
You can use it then.

1235
00:51:00,219 --> 00:51:01,250
(Indifferent)

1236
00:51:01,549 --> 00:51:03,690
And this is the most popular...

1237
00:51:03,690 --> 00:51:04,690
Okay.

1238
00:51:04,690 --> 00:51:06,089
(What's the present
Dex is taking out with pride?)

1239
00:51:06,089 --> 00:51:07,159
What could it be?

1240
00:51:07,560 --> 00:51:09,259
I brought soju.

1241
00:51:10,159 --> 00:51:11,630
I brought soju.

1242
00:51:11,630 --> 00:51:14,029
(Chuckling)

1243
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:16,529
- I look really happy.
- He was happier than when he saw me.

1244
00:51:16,529 --> 00:51:17,699
He seems over the moon.

1245
00:51:17,699 --> 00:51:18,739
- Seriously.
- Gosh.

1246
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:20,469
- No wonder why it was so heavy.
- He's so happy.

1247
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:23,009
I brought soju.

1248
00:51:23,009 --> 00:51:24,270
(At the sight of soju,
the liquor he's been looking for,)

1249
00:51:24,569 --> 00:51:25,909
(he flashes all of his gum.)

1250
00:51:25,909 --> 00:51:26,909
Hey!

1251
00:51:27,810 --> 00:51:31,380
(He had been looking for liquor
since the first day he got to India.)

1252
00:51:32,679 --> 00:51:34,819
(He couldn't find his favorite drink
even at the restaurant.)

1253
00:51:35,619 --> 00:51:37,489
(Pouting)

1254
00:51:38,089 --> 00:51:40,759
(He looked for alcohol
every chance he got.)

1255
00:51:40,759 --> 00:51:43,489
(But he couldn't find it anywhere.)

1256
00:51:43,989 --> 00:51:45,900
(The liquor has come at last!)

1257
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,799
(Chuckling)

1258
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:49,929
Hey! You punk.

1259
00:51:49,929 --> 00:51:52,069
- Gosh, Kian84.
- He's genuinely thrilled.

1260
00:51:52,069 --> 00:51:53,770
He was the happiest I had seen.

1261
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:55,810
- I brought this for you.
- Yes.

1262
00:51:55,810 --> 00:51:57,239
- Great job.
- You see how much I brought?

1263
00:51:57,239 --> 00:51:59,380
- Great job, Dex.
- I brought all of them.

1264
00:51:59,380 --> 00:52:01,040
- Great.
- You know? Right.

1265
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,009
- You're indeed an A-list celebrity.
- I mean...

1266
00:52:03,009 --> 00:52:04,650
Do you need to see more stuff?

1267
00:52:04,650 --> 00:52:07,119
- This is all I needed to see.
- Right.

1268
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,819
- I'll pack it up again.
- Okay.

1269
00:52:09,690 --> 00:52:11,860
When you took out the eyepatch,
I was taken aback.

1270
00:52:12,190 --> 00:52:13,889
I thought, "What's he doing?"

1271
00:52:14,619 --> 00:52:16,460
I had no idea you'd be this happy.

1272
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:20,060
I'm sorry.
I looked happier to see soju than you.

1273
00:52:20,060 --> 00:52:21,600
- When you saw me...
- No.

1274
00:52:21,600 --> 00:52:23,400
- When you saw me, you looked calm.
- No.

1275
00:52:23,400 --> 00:52:26,100
- "You're here, Dex."
- No. Dex.

1276
00:52:26,100 --> 00:52:28,270
(The biggest reaction)

1277
00:52:28,270 --> 00:52:30,869
He's indeed an A-list soldier
from the special forces.

1278
00:52:31,009 --> 00:52:34,009
I was happier to see soju than to see Dex.

1279
00:52:34,009 --> 00:52:35,279
I feel bad about that.

1280
00:52:35,980 --> 00:52:37,909
He was happier to see soju than to see me.

1281
00:52:37,909 --> 00:52:39,549
- Right.
- I thought, "Is he serious?"

1282
00:52:39,549 --> 00:52:41,690
- But I was happy for him too.
- No.

1283
00:52:41,690 --> 00:52:44,119
- A lot of thoughts crossed my mind.
- I was happy to drink it with you.

1284
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:46,719
- Yes.
- Come in.

1285
00:52:46,719 --> 00:52:47,719
Okay.

1286
00:52:47,920 --> 00:52:49,690
- Okay.
- Hey. Thank you.

1287
00:52:50,089 --> 00:52:51,799
Right. The table...

1288
00:52:52,900 --> 00:52:54,929
Right here. This is our table.

1289
00:52:54,929 --> 00:52:56,330
- Right.
- Thank you.

1290
00:52:56,330 --> 00:52:57,569
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1291
00:52:57,569 --> 00:52:59,040
He gave us a lot of food.

1292
00:52:59,799 --> 00:53:01,369
(Thanking him in Spanish)

1293
00:53:02,009 --> 00:53:03,239
All right.

1294
00:53:03,239 --> 00:53:05,779
- Let's get started.
- Dig in.

1295
00:53:06,009 --> 00:53:07,779
- Thank you for the food.
- That's an outdated mindset.

1296
00:53:07,779 --> 00:53:08,880
Eat a lot.

1297
00:53:12,279 --> 00:53:14,020
(Humming)

1298
00:53:14,750 --> 00:53:16,750
- This Indian dish is tasty.
- Yes.

1299
00:53:17,619 --> 00:53:20,319
Hey, I was worried too.
But food here is great.

1300
00:53:20,319 --> 00:53:21,560
- How is this tasty?
- Right.

1301
00:53:22,790 --> 00:53:24,900
You have a weak stomach
which is surprising.

1302
00:53:25,029 --> 00:53:26,630
I can't even eat cilantro.

1303
00:53:29,170 --> 00:53:31,699
(But luckily,
they're enjoying their food today.)

1304
00:53:31,699 --> 00:53:32,699
(Humming in approval)

1305
00:53:32,699 --> 00:53:34,869
- This is good.
- I'm so happy right now.

1306
00:53:35,639 --> 00:53:36,869
I don't know.

1307
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:41,080
I spent all day today doing
what was on my bucket list.

1308
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:44,080
I went to the cremation ghat.
And I tried out different things.

1309
00:53:44,449 --> 00:53:45,520
But I'm the happiest right now.

1310
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:46,980
- You are, right?
- Yes.

1311
00:53:46,980 --> 00:53:48,119
I'm the happiest right now.

1312
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:50,290
- I can relate to that.
- Okay.

1313
00:53:50,690 --> 00:53:53,089
On my way here, I was moving around alone.

1314
00:53:53,589 --> 00:53:54,589
I was lonely.

1315
00:53:54,589 --> 00:53:56,659
- We're in a foreign country.
- Right.

1316
00:53:56,659 --> 00:53:58,299
- It's a different country.
- There's this sense of loneliness...

1317
00:53:58,299 --> 00:54:00,330
you feel in a country, far away from home.

1318
00:54:00,429 --> 00:54:03,799
But when I met you,
it felt like I had the whole world.

1319
00:54:04,630 --> 00:54:06,000
- It feels reassuring.
- Right.

1320
00:54:06,400 --> 00:54:08,310
- Thank you.
- Let's enjoy our time here.

1321
00:54:08,310 --> 00:54:09,810
Let's have fun here.

1322
00:54:10,509 --> 00:54:11,710
This is nice.

1323
00:54:12,139 --> 00:54:14,110
Thank you for the food.

1324
00:54:14,409 --> 00:54:16,110
Can I borrow the pair of slippers
from the airline?

1325
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:17,810
- Gosh.
- Sorry.

1326
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:20,219
This is the perfect time to use them.

1327
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:23,520
He can't complain
about how Dex's backpack is heavy now.

1328
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,619
It's got everything.

1329
00:54:25,190 --> 00:54:27,119
Gosh, this room is so humid.

1330
00:54:28,929 --> 00:54:30,529
Let me set this up.

1331
00:54:30,529 --> 00:54:31,630
Sure.

1332
00:54:33,730 --> 00:54:35,299
What's this? He brought a sleeping bag?

1333
00:54:35,299 --> 00:54:36,330
(What's that?)

1334
00:54:36,529 --> 00:54:39,000
Hey, are you crazy?

1335
00:54:42,239 --> 00:54:43,969
That's a camping mattress.

1336
00:54:43,969 --> 00:54:45,279
(This well-prepared guy
brought a camping mattress too.)

1337
00:54:45,909 --> 00:54:48,449
(He's serious when it comes to his bed.)

1338
00:54:49,279 --> 00:54:50,350
- Gosh.
- This is it.

1339
00:54:50,350 --> 00:54:51,480
(A camping mattress)

1340
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,880
I had the camping pillow
and the sleeping bag.

1341
00:54:54,819 --> 00:54:56,589
(Laughing)

1342
00:54:56,589 --> 00:54:58,920
- There's no point in booking a room then.
- Right.

1343
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:00,889
- He's in a different world.
- Right.

1344
00:55:01,159 --> 00:55:03,029
I packed the entire bed in my backpack.

1345
00:55:03,029 --> 00:55:04,330
- That's it.
- That's crazy.

1346
00:55:06,159 --> 00:55:08,130
Wash up. You should take a shower.

1347
00:55:08,130 --> 00:55:10,299
- Do you want to take a shower first?
- Should I?

1348
00:55:10,299 --> 00:55:11,540
- You should take a shower first.
- Okay.

1349
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,770
- I think I'll take long.
- Okay.

1350
00:55:14,670 --> 00:55:15,969
(Tossing)

1351
00:55:17,210 --> 00:55:19,509
(He's making the bed
while Kian84 takes a shower.)

1352
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:22,449
The rice grains are all over the bed.

1353
00:55:23,509 --> 00:55:26,350
He made the bed for Kian84.

1354
00:55:27,619 --> 00:55:29,089
(Chuckling)

1355
00:55:29,549 --> 00:55:31,150
Gosh. You're so neat.

1356
00:55:31,389 --> 00:55:34,259
It doesn't feel right to sleep
on top of the rice grains.

1357
00:55:34,259 --> 00:55:35,290
Right.

1358
00:55:35,290 --> 00:55:36,860
We're not here to train.

1359
00:55:38,060 --> 00:55:39,900
- I'll go to sleep now.
- Okay. Goodnight.

1360
00:55:39,900 --> 00:55:40,929
Goodnight.

1361
00:55:41,670 --> 00:55:42,929
(Staring)

1362
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:46,040
Look at this guy.

1363
00:55:48,170 --> 00:55:50,710
Is it because he's a zoomer? He's neat.

1364
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:52,480
A zoomer?

1365
00:55:52,909 --> 00:55:56,049
(Pounding)

1366
00:55:56,049 --> 00:55:57,110
- What?
- What are you doing?

1367
00:55:57,110 --> 00:55:58,549
- I'm massaging my muscles.
- What's wrong with him?

1368
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,250
- What's he doing?
- What's wrong with him?

1369
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,389
Why are you hitting yourself?

1370
00:56:03,389 --> 00:56:05,020
I sometimes hit my buttocks.

1371
00:56:05,790 --> 00:56:08,690
(He passes out after flogging himself.)

1372
00:56:12,929 --> 00:56:14,029
- Kian84.
- Yes.

1373
00:56:14,029 --> 00:56:16,230
- Sleep comfortably.
- Yes.

1374
00:56:17,199 --> 00:56:18,540
Sweet dreams.

1375
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:20,100
- Okay. Sweet dreams.
- Okay.

1376
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,239
(He sleeps comfortably thanks to Dex.)

1377
00:56:30,509 --> 00:56:31,549
(The morning breaks again in Varanasi.)

1378
00:56:31,549 --> 00:56:33,779
- Mornings in India look great.
- Yes.

1379
00:56:33,779 --> 00:56:35,889
- It's full of energy in the morning.
- Right.

1380
00:56:36,850 --> 00:56:41,589
(Kian84 and Dex are getting ready
early in the morning.)

1381
00:56:42,259 --> 00:56:43,460
Well,

1382
00:56:43,889 --> 00:56:45,860
- we're going to work out.
- Right.

1383
00:56:46,199 --> 00:56:49,170
I don't have to wash up.
I'll just wash my face.

1384
00:56:50,130 --> 00:56:52,940
Gosh. I'll wear the same pants
from yesterday.

1385
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:53,940
Of course.

1386
00:56:55,210 --> 00:56:58,580
(He goes into the bathroom
to wash his face.)

1387
00:57:00,139 --> 00:57:01,139
(Clicking)

1388
00:57:01,139 --> 00:57:02,549
- What's going on?
- What is it?

1389
00:57:03,750 --> 00:57:06,420
- What's going on?
- The power often goes out.

1390
00:57:06,420 --> 00:57:07,480
It goes out?

1391
00:57:07,679 --> 00:57:08,790
- My gosh.
- Really?

1392
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:11,219
It's okay. The power will come back soon.

1393
00:57:11,219 --> 00:57:12,420
For real?

1394
00:57:14,520 --> 00:57:16,989
I heard that Varanasi
had frequent blackouts...

1395
00:57:16,989 --> 00:57:18,900
- due to problems with power supplies.
- Yes.

1396
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,860
- Kian84 is cool about it.
- Right?

1397
00:57:20,860 --> 00:57:21,869
(No reaction)

1398
00:57:22,770 --> 00:57:25,100
Should I exchange some money for you?

1399
00:57:25,569 --> 00:57:26,969
Don't you need money?

1400
00:57:26,969 --> 00:57:27,969
Yes, I do.

1401
00:57:28,069 --> 00:57:32,940
(Dex also received 800 dollars
as a travel expense.)

1402
00:57:33,509 --> 00:57:35,250
Come here. I'll exchange some for you.

1403
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,750
How much would you like to exchange?

1404
00:57:36,750 --> 00:57:37,980
One hundred dollars.

1405
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,319
- One hundred dollars?
- Yes.

1406
00:57:39,319 --> 00:57:41,449
- It's the Kian84 exchange counter.
- Go for a larger amount.

1407
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:44,150
Thirty dollars.

1408
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:45,520
No, forty dollars.

1409
00:57:45,960 --> 00:57:47,589
I said a larger amount. Why ask for less?

1410
00:57:47,589 --> 00:57:48,730
Then 400 dollars.

1411
00:57:48,730 --> 00:57:49,889
Four hundred dollars? Okay.

1412
00:57:50,960 --> 00:57:52,860
- I was distracted.
- You both are not good with numbers.

1413
00:57:52,860 --> 00:57:54,060
Yes, I'm not.

1414
00:57:54,060 --> 00:57:55,799
- You two are the same.
- That's right.

1415
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,130
That will be 33,000 rupees.

1416
00:57:58,130 --> 00:57:59,500
I gave you more.

1417
00:57:59,500 --> 00:58:01,839
- Really?
- Yes. I didn't take a commission.

1418
00:58:02,009 --> 00:58:03,239
Thank you.

1419
00:58:03,940 --> 00:58:04,940
Let's go.

1420
00:58:09,049 --> 00:58:11,610
(The two guys are hitting the road again.)

1421
00:58:12,279 --> 00:58:13,580
(Patting)

1422
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,049
- Are you okay?
- I've lost my sense of reality.

1423
00:58:16,350 --> 00:58:17,420
Is this...

1424
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:20,619
- You're in India.
- So this is India.

1425
00:58:22,360 --> 00:58:23,429
Gym.

1426
00:58:25,429 --> 00:58:27,330
(Searching up something)

1427
00:58:27,330 --> 00:58:28,500
Give me a second.

1428
00:58:28,799 --> 00:58:30,569
(During the boat tour)

1429
00:58:30,869 --> 00:58:33,400
(Kian84 looked for gyms.)

1430
00:58:34,040 --> 00:58:35,839
(The gym Bicky told him...)

1431
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,969
(was Akhara.)

1432
00:58:38,980 --> 00:58:42,080
Bicky told me there was a gym...

1433
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,909
behind the place...

1434
00:58:44,909 --> 00:58:46,779
I swam yesterday.

1435
00:58:48,589 --> 00:58:50,619
How far is the gym from here?

1436
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:51,960
It's about 2km away.

1437
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:53,190
- 2km?
- Yes.

1438
00:58:53,790 --> 00:58:54,920
Can you run?

1439
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,230
Of course.

1440
00:58:56,989 --> 00:58:59,159
- Let's start.
- Let's go.

1441
00:58:59,159 --> 00:59:01,159
- Kian84 always ran alone.
- Yes.

1442
00:59:01,159 --> 00:59:02,600
- Running together...
- You got a running mate.

1443
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:04,929
- Yes. I was so happy.
- It pumped me up too.

1444
00:59:06,040 --> 00:59:08,770
I can't believe
I'm running right next to the Ganges.

1445
00:59:08,770 --> 00:59:10,339
(Jumping)

1446
00:59:10,770 --> 00:59:12,480
The Ganges is on my left.

1447
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,480
(A morning run along Mother's protection)

1448
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:17,150
(Running early in the morning,)

1449
00:59:17,679 --> 00:59:21,150
(they witness the morning view.)

1450
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,949
Hello. Good morning.

1451
00:59:24,750 --> 00:59:25,819
Good morning.

1452
00:59:27,319 --> 00:59:29,560
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

1453
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:33,560
- Hi.
- Hi.

1454
00:59:33,560 --> 00:59:35,170
- Hello.
- Hello.

1455
00:59:35,170 --> 00:59:36,330
- Hello.
- Hello.

1456
00:59:38,170 --> 00:59:39,900
- This is nice.
- Yes.

1457
00:59:40,699 --> 00:59:42,139
I was on cloud nine back then.

1458
00:59:42,569 --> 00:59:44,909
Because I went to bed
without working out last night,

1459
00:59:44,909 --> 00:59:46,210
I felt uneasy.

1460
00:59:46,210 --> 00:59:48,850
It was as if I was making atonement
for yesterday.

1461
00:59:48,850 --> 00:59:51,179
And jogging first thing in the morning...

1462
00:59:51,350 --> 00:59:54,920
gave me a good start to my day.

1463
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:56,350
That was how I felt.

1464
00:59:58,350 --> 01:00:00,690
Is that place something like an army base?

1465
01:00:01,119 --> 01:00:02,889
That place? I don't know.

1466
01:00:03,730 --> 01:00:07,799
(Bicky explained to him in Korean.)

1467
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:09,929
(Barking)

1468
01:00:09,929 --> 01:00:11,069
You're noisy, punk!

1469
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:14,139
(Flapping)

1470
01:00:14,969 --> 01:00:16,409
I wonder what this place is for.

1471
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:19,980
- These are all boats, right?
- Yes.

1472
01:00:20,380 --> 01:00:22,549
I arrived at night,
so I couldn't see anything.

1473
01:00:22,549 --> 01:00:23,710
- Right.
- I saw them for the first time...

1474
01:00:23,710 --> 01:00:24,850
with Kian84.

1475
01:00:27,449 --> 01:00:30,489
(Looking around)

1476
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,420
There is a lot of wall art.

1477
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:34,159
- There are no empty walls.
- Yes.

1478
01:00:34,159 --> 01:00:35,230
They are all painted.

1479
01:00:35,230 --> 01:00:37,130
(Dex has a lot to see and ask.)

1480
01:00:37,929 --> 01:00:40,000
What are these people trying to get here?

1481
01:00:42,330 --> 01:00:43,500
Oh, they're praying.

1482
01:00:44,469 --> 01:00:45,639
(Looking down)

1483
01:00:45,639 --> 01:00:48,339
I just said he was praying.
But do you know what he was doing?

1484
01:00:48,339 --> 01:00:50,009
- What was he doing?
- Looking at his phone.

1485
01:00:50,810 --> 01:00:53,679
You're fascinated by even those?
What a cutie.

1486
01:00:54,380 --> 01:00:55,409
"Cutie."

1487
01:00:56,610 --> 01:00:58,350
I'm getting pumped up today.

1488
01:00:58,350 --> 01:01:00,449
- "Pumped up?"
- I will set the gym on fire.

1489
01:01:05,259 --> 01:01:06,290
(Barking)

1490
01:01:10,630 --> 01:01:13,029
(Very energetic)

1491
01:01:13,900 --> 01:01:16,199
Working out every day...

1492
01:01:16,369 --> 01:01:18,000
gives me good energy.

1493
01:01:18,100 --> 01:01:20,400
Going to work out makes me all happy.

1494
01:01:20,500 --> 01:01:22,409
(Breathing heavily)

1495
01:01:23,110 --> 01:01:24,270
This is the place.

1496
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:25,440
- We're here?
- This is the place.

1497
01:01:26,210 --> 01:01:27,710
You have much better stamina.

1498
01:01:28,139 --> 01:01:29,549
You're still lively.

1499
01:01:31,080 --> 01:01:32,819
Excuse me.

1500
01:01:33,779 --> 01:01:35,250
Where is Akhara?

1501
01:01:35,250 --> 01:01:36,250
- "Akhara?"
- Gym Akhara.

1502
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:37,949
- You have to go up the stairs,
- Up the stairs?

1503
01:01:37,949 --> 01:01:39,560
then turn left and then right.

1504
01:01:39,560 --> 01:01:41,319
Okay. Thank you.

1505
01:01:42,290 --> 01:01:43,429
You're good at English.

1506
01:01:43,759 --> 01:01:46,159
- I'm just winging it.
- But still.

1507
01:01:47,630 --> 01:01:48,670
Gosh.

1508
01:01:49,469 --> 01:01:51,000
- Turn right.
- "Turn right."

1509
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:52,000
Turn left.

1510
01:01:52,000 --> 01:01:53,000
(It's another narrow alley.)

1511
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,440
- Is this the place?
- Hold on.

1512
01:01:56,639 --> 01:01:57,909
(They head into the gym.)

1513
01:01:57,909 --> 01:01:58,980
I can see the barbell.

1514
01:01:58,980 --> 01:02:01,509
(But there's no roof?)

1515
01:02:01,679 --> 01:02:03,049
What? This is a martial arts gym.

1516
01:02:03,049 --> 01:02:04,650
For real? It's a martial arts gym.

1517
01:02:04,650 --> 01:02:05,819
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

1518
01:02:05,819 --> 01:02:06,819
(An outdoor training area?)

1519
01:02:08,279 --> 01:02:10,150
That's the kind of gym we're thinking of.

1520
01:02:10,520 --> 01:02:11,850
That was what I thought too.

1521
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:14,920
(The two were excited
to go to an indoor gym.)

1522
01:02:15,989 --> 01:02:17,330
(There must be AC in there.)

1523
01:02:18,230 --> 01:02:21,230
(But there is no roof for an AC.)

1524
01:02:21,630 --> 01:02:23,429
We came to work out, so why?

1525
01:02:23,429 --> 01:02:24,569
Martial arts?

1526
01:02:25,299 --> 01:02:26,770
- This...
- That's the gym.

1527
01:02:26,839 --> 01:02:28,540
Akhara is a place to train...

1528
01:02:28,540 --> 01:02:30,610
the body and soul
through ancient exercises...

1529
01:02:30,610 --> 01:02:32,380
and religious discipline.

1530
01:02:32,380 --> 01:02:34,810
Youngsters in Varanasi...

1531
01:02:34,810 --> 01:02:37,350
still prefer training in Akhara.

1532
01:02:37,949 --> 01:02:40,020
- Kasahi?
- "Kasahi."

1533
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:41,619
- Sakahi?
- "Sakahi."

1534
01:02:41,619 --> 01:02:44,150
- Sakahi or Kasahi, whatever that gym was.
- Akhara.

1535
01:02:44,489 --> 01:02:46,259
Gym Akhara.

1536
01:02:46,560 --> 01:02:49,489
I thought it was a gym called Akhara.

1537
01:02:49,489 --> 01:02:50,730
But it was a wrestling place.

1538
01:02:51,230 --> 01:02:53,730
So Akhara was not the name of the place.

1539
01:02:53,730 --> 01:02:55,130
- No.
- It wasn't a fitness center.

1540
01:02:55,130 --> 01:02:56,429
We had a different idea about it.

1541
01:02:56,429 --> 01:02:57,869
- It was like a mountain fitness park.
- Yes.

1542
01:02:57,869 --> 01:02:59,500
What's more, it had no membership system.

1543
01:02:59,500 --> 01:03:01,900
- Anyone could come and work out.
- Yes.

1544
01:03:01,900 --> 01:03:03,839
- Was it for free?
- Yes, it was for free.

1545
01:03:03,839 --> 01:03:06,210
- Really?
- It really gave me a shock.

1546
01:03:06,339 --> 01:03:08,540
The residents collect...

1547
01:03:08,710 --> 01:03:11,850
small amounts of money to run that place.

1548
01:03:13,549 --> 01:03:15,589
Namaste.

1549
01:03:16,290 --> 01:03:18,659
- That man must be the director.
- He's the director.

1550
01:03:18,819 --> 01:03:22,830
- He told me he was 70 years old.
- Gosh.

1551
01:03:23,830 --> 01:03:25,960
- Are you here to exercise?
- Yes.

1552
01:03:26,400 --> 01:03:27,960
(Come in.)

1553
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:30,799
(It's still new to the two newbies.)

1554
01:03:31,569 --> 01:03:34,000
- You, do this.
- Okay.

1555
01:03:34,469 --> 01:03:36,310
He told us to watch and did that.

1556
01:03:36,909 --> 01:03:38,469
He gave us a demonstration.

1557
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:41,580
It must be made of wood.

1558
01:03:41,779 --> 01:03:43,810
- Okay.
- I think we came to the wrong place.

1559
01:03:46,619 --> 01:03:48,150
You're good at it.

1560
01:03:49,790 --> 01:03:51,150
Wait, sir.

1561
01:03:51,520 --> 01:03:54,089
I wanted to go on the treadmill.

1562
01:03:54,619 --> 01:03:56,989
My plan was to do
a simple cardio exercise.

1563
01:03:57,989 --> 01:03:59,560
(A newbie needing guidance has appeared.)

1564
01:04:00,330 --> 01:04:01,929
(Laughing)

1565
01:04:01,929 --> 01:04:03,270
Oh, like this?

1566
01:04:03,500 --> 01:04:05,699
- He...
- When new members join gyms in Korea,

1567
01:04:05,699 --> 01:04:08,040
the directors love it.

1568
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,540
- That's right.
- "Hey, try this."

1569
01:04:09,540 --> 01:04:11,940
"Lift this up. You can do it!"

1570
01:04:12,040 --> 01:04:15,179
There are many like him,
even in neighborhood gyms.

1571
01:04:15,179 --> 01:04:17,009
And they boast about new machines.

1572
01:04:17,009 --> 01:04:18,819
- Totally.
- Something like that.

1573
01:04:18,819 --> 01:04:21,650
- We were told to try it out.
- They're no different. India is the same.

1574
01:04:22,350 --> 01:04:25,119
(Showing off the new equipment)

1575
01:04:25,119 --> 01:04:26,119
(Laughing)

1576
01:04:26,119 --> 01:04:27,920
Okay.

1577
01:04:28,520 --> 01:04:29,889
Keep your mouth closed.

1578
01:04:30,730 --> 01:04:32,529
(Closing his mouth)

1579
01:04:33,230 --> 01:04:34,529
(Laughing)

1580
01:04:35,770 --> 01:04:37,130
- You.
- Okay.

1581
01:04:39,799 --> 01:04:41,500
- You.
- Take it off?

1582
01:04:41,569 --> 01:04:44,270
The director suddenly suggested
taking off your top.

1583
01:04:44,540 --> 01:04:46,380
He said to undress.
That was out of the blue.

1584
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:48,509
(Taking off)

1585
01:04:49,710 --> 01:04:51,250
- Gosh.
- He's prepared.

1586
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:54,179
- He's prepared.
- Look at Kian84.

1587
01:04:54,779 --> 01:04:56,389
Why are you so pale?

1588
01:04:56,389 --> 01:04:57,690
You're like boiled chicken.

1589
01:04:59,159 --> 01:05:00,759
(Pale as snow)

1590
01:05:01,960 --> 01:05:04,330
(A mud massage
like seasoning boiled chicken)

1591
01:05:06,029 --> 01:05:07,929
(A generous amount)

1592
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,869
The director loves you.

1593
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,540
(Loosening him up)

1594
01:05:13,540 --> 01:05:15,710
- Okay.
- That must've felt great, Kian84.

1595
01:05:16,139 --> 01:05:18,810
- What is this?
- What are we doing right now?

1596
01:05:18,810 --> 01:05:20,409
(A full course training
led by the director)

1597
01:05:22,710 --> 01:05:25,480
(Dragging him)

1598
01:05:26,980 --> 01:05:30,719
Our master was very enthusiastic.

1599
01:05:30,819 --> 01:05:34,560
We couldn't do anything.

1600
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:35,889
He dragged us around.

1601
01:05:35,889 --> 01:05:39,029
And we couldn't possibly say no
because he was very passionate.

1602
01:05:40,259 --> 01:05:41,799
- Master is very enthusiastic.
- Totally.

1603
01:05:44,100 --> 01:05:45,330
(Looking around)

1604
01:05:46,170 --> 01:05:47,799
Put it down.

1605
01:05:48,239 --> 01:05:50,310
- Master is gone.
- Let's put them down.

1606
01:05:50,670 --> 01:05:52,679
- Let's put them down.
- Are you trying to escape?

1607
01:05:53,980 --> 01:05:55,949
(They're taking a break
behind Master's back.)

1608
01:05:59,179 --> 01:06:01,049
- Gosh, what's Master doing now?
- Master.

1609
01:06:01,279 --> 01:06:02,949
(They spotted something.)

1610
01:06:02,949 --> 01:06:04,190
- Master.
- Master.

1611
01:06:04,190 --> 01:06:06,119
- Master is...
- Master.

1612
01:06:06,119 --> 01:06:08,190
- Master. Is he okay?
- Master keeps...

1613
01:06:08,460 --> 01:06:09,589
- His body will ache all over.
- He's on Instagram.

1614
01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:11,860
I think he has over 100,000 followers
on Instagram.

1615
01:06:12,630 --> 01:06:14,900
There are old men like that
on Acha Mountain too.

1616
01:06:15,330 --> 01:06:17,369
I've seen it in "What On Earth!"

1617
01:06:17,730 --> 01:06:18,730
(It's like they're watching
a live episode of "What On Earth!")

1618
01:06:18,730 --> 01:06:19,940
I've used up all my strength.

1619
01:06:20,500 --> 01:06:21,670
What's going on over here?

1620
01:06:24,540 --> 01:06:26,480
I think he's a master too.

1621
01:06:26,980 --> 01:06:28,880
A master of the iron bars.

1622
01:06:28,880 --> 01:06:31,580
- Even the ordinary neighborhood men...
- What's going on?

1623
01:06:32,179 --> 01:06:33,679
are masters of martial arts.

1624
01:06:34,049 --> 01:06:36,190
(His moves are fancy.)

1625
01:06:36,420 --> 01:06:38,190
Gosh, what is that?

1626
01:06:39,020 --> 01:06:41,520
That man seems like
he could be an accountant.

1627
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:43,060
- Right.
- This was so unexpected.

1628
01:06:43,060 --> 01:06:44,989
(The man is physically skilled.)

1629
01:06:45,360 --> 01:06:47,600
There are a lot of
masters of martial arts here.

1630
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:49,799
(The master of horizontal bars
gives them a demonstration.)

1631
01:06:49,799 --> 01:06:51,429
- Try.
- Try.

1632
01:06:51,429 --> 01:06:52,739
- Gosh.
- He's flexible.

1633
01:06:53,799 --> 01:06:54,799
- This is so amazing.
- Gosh.

1634
01:06:54,799 --> 01:06:55,810
(He flipped over very quickly.)

1635
01:06:56,839 --> 01:06:57,839
(What?)

1636
01:06:57,839 --> 01:06:58,909
He's an eccentric man.

1637
01:06:59,610 --> 01:07:00,639
- Gosh.
- But...

1638
01:07:00,639 --> 01:07:03,150
(He's happy to see the eccentric man's
fierce performance.)

1639
01:07:04,150 --> 01:07:05,580
- He's amazing. Gosh.
- Goodness.

1640
01:07:05,580 --> 01:07:06,819
(He finished off
the performance with a split.)

1641
01:07:06,819 --> 01:07:08,020
Like this?

1642
01:07:09,690 --> 01:07:12,089
(Now it's time for them
to try out the horizontal bars.)

1643
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:15,589
(He's scooching forward.)

1644
01:07:17,029 --> 01:07:18,089
What is that?

1645
01:07:21,759 --> 01:07:23,130
(What?)

1646
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,330
- I did it. I did it.
- What's that face?

1647
01:07:25,500 --> 01:07:29,040
(What is that?)

1648
01:07:29,310 --> 01:07:31,239
It's close to what he did. Like this.

1649
01:07:32,480 --> 01:07:33,980
(His split seems awkward somehow.)

1650
01:07:33,980 --> 01:07:35,239
That was pretty good.

1651
01:07:35,339 --> 01:07:37,409
(He's marveling at Kian84.)

1652
01:07:37,779 --> 01:07:39,719
(This time, he's changing positions.)

1653
01:07:39,949 --> 01:07:41,679
- I'm doing quite okay, aren't I?
- You're good at this.

1654
01:07:43,089 --> 01:07:44,190
(He's using his abs all of a sudden.)

1655
01:07:44,190 --> 01:07:45,489
- Gosh.
- This is nothing.

1656
01:07:45,860 --> 01:07:47,159
My body's nice.

1657
01:07:47,159 --> 01:07:49,429
- It's nice.
- Kian84 is awesome.

1658
01:07:49,429 --> 01:07:51,230
- I'm sexy.
- I thought you'd fall behind Dex,

1659
01:07:51,230 --> 01:07:52,500
- but you don't.
- I don't.

1660
01:07:54,900 --> 01:07:56,000
He's doing dips.

1661
01:07:56,799 --> 01:07:58,940
(He's dancing?)

1662
01:07:58,940 --> 01:07:59,969
What's wrong with him?

1663
01:08:00,440 --> 01:08:03,810
(They've begun individual workouts
after learning from the masters.)

1664
01:08:07,509 --> 01:08:08,949
Isn't Kian84 in good shape?

1665
01:08:08,949 --> 01:08:10,549
- Yes.
- He is.

1666
01:08:10,549 --> 01:08:12,210
Check out his muscles. Gosh.

1667
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:14,520
Gosh. I'll probably be hearing
from "Physical: 100" soon.

1668
01:08:14,520 --> 01:08:16,049
Gosh. I'm busy.

1669
01:08:16,049 --> 01:08:17,549
You should give it a try.

1670
01:08:18,920 --> 01:08:20,819
(They fulfilled the amount of exercise
they've been lacking by 100 percent.)

1671
01:08:22,690 --> 01:08:23,830
(He's crying from satisfaction.)

1672
01:08:23,830 --> 01:08:24,929
- Are you crying?
- Oh, my goodness.

1673
01:08:24,929 --> 01:08:26,299
That could really be tears.

1674
01:08:28,299 --> 01:08:29,869
I think my muscles are pumped up.

1675
01:08:31,330 --> 01:08:33,540
Can you do those poses?

1676
01:08:33,540 --> 01:08:35,810
The poses bodybuilders do in competitions.

1677
01:08:36,069 --> 01:08:37,339
No, I can't.

1678
01:08:37,339 --> 01:08:38,869
I imitate those guys on YouTube.

1679
01:08:45,780 --> 01:08:47,410
He wanted to show off.

1680
01:08:47,809 --> 01:08:49,410
They always seem to brush
their hands against their lips.

1681
01:08:51,079 --> 01:08:52,119
Like that?

1682
01:08:55,220 --> 01:08:56,320
It looks all right.

1683
01:08:57,590 --> 01:09:00,119
(He's posing full-scale.)

1684
01:09:01,260 --> 01:09:03,229
And you have to smile at the end.

1685
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:04,530
Gosh.

1686
01:09:04,530 --> 01:09:05,530
(Smile)

1687
01:09:05,959 --> 01:09:06,999
Gosh.

1688
01:09:07,729 --> 01:09:09,200
They all pose while smiling.

1689
01:09:09,200 --> 01:09:10,869
- Are you imitating them?
- Hey, that's a meme right there.

1690
01:09:10,869 --> 01:09:12,300
I couldn't see my face.

1691
01:09:12,300 --> 01:09:13,999
"Smile." Like this.

1692
01:09:14,269 --> 01:09:15,610
It's not bad.

1693
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:16,970
(He puts a smile on his face.)

1694
01:09:16,970 --> 01:09:18,110
He looks like a real bodybuilder.

1695
01:09:19,039 --> 01:09:21,139
He looks like Mr. Tong.

1696
01:09:21,380 --> 01:09:23,749
Aren't you Mr. Tong?

1697
01:09:24,209 --> 01:09:25,780
You look like Mr. Tong.

1698
01:09:25,780 --> 01:09:26,849
(Trembling)

1699
01:09:28,919 --> 01:09:30,990
I can do the pose Kim Dong Hyun
used to make when he entered the ring.

1700
01:09:31,849 --> 01:09:33,720
(Former UFC fighter, Kim Dong Hyun's
pose when he entered the ring)

1701
01:09:33,720 --> 01:09:34,959
He said he could do that pose.

1702
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:38,130
Blue corner, Kim Dong Hyun.

1703
01:09:45,099 --> 01:09:47,139
I have no idea what you're doing.

1704
01:09:48,200 --> 01:09:50,269
- Don't you know his UFC pose?
- That was from the UFC?

1705
01:09:50,269 --> 01:09:51,410
He is Korea's pride.

1706
01:09:52,439 --> 01:09:54,240
Their bodies look similar.

1707
01:09:54,240 --> 01:09:56,309
I think Kim Dong Hyun is amazing.

1708
01:09:56,309 --> 01:09:57,479
- I wondered what you were doing.
- I see.

1709
01:09:58,380 --> 01:09:59,919
(After finishing up
the intense workout...)

1710
01:09:59,919 --> 01:10:01,220
You want to try wrestling?

1711
01:10:01,220 --> 01:10:02,490
- Wrestling?
- Wrestling?

1712
01:10:02,689 --> 01:10:05,519
"Akhara" means "wrestling arena" in Hindi,

1713
01:10:05,519 --> 01:10:06,889
so you should learn wrestling.

1714
01:10:08,059 --> 01:10:09,590
Okay. Try.

1715
01:10:10,030 --> 01:10:11,389
Right. You have to keep your pride.

1716
01:10:11,389 --> 01:10:13,459
"Let's show them."

1717
01:10:14,629 --> 01:10:16,299
(Kian84 is stepping forward first
since he's older.)

1718
01:10:17,429 --> 01:10:18,629
(He stepped forward as soon as
he took a look at Kian84.)

1719
01:10:18,629 --> 01:10:19,799
He looks strong.

1720
01:10:20,839 --> 01:10:22,210
You got this, Kian84.

1721
01:10:23,339 --> 01:10:25,979
(He's determined to win
as he's pulling up his pants.)

1722
01:10:27,080 --> 01:10:28,339
(He has learned a lot of sports, including
Muay Thai, jiu-jitsu, and boxing.)

1723
01:10:28,339 --> 01:10:29,780
Right, he learned Muay Thai.

1724
01:10:29,780 --> 01:10:31,179
Right, he did learn Muay Thai.

1725
01:10:31,509 --> 01:10:33,479
(He's the black sheep of sports.)

1726
01:10:34,879 --> 01:10:36,519
I think Kian84 will do great.

1727
01:10:36,519 --> 01:10:37,620
- Me?
- Yes.

1728
01:10:38,450 --> 01:10:40,920
(The match begins without delay.)

1729
01:10:42,019 --> 01:10:44,929
(They're feeling each other out
amid tension.)

1730
01:10:46,330 --> 01:10:47,400
(Grabbing)

1731
01:10:47,400 --> 01:10:48,769
Look at that.

1732
01:10:48,769 --> 01:10:51,299
(He continues pushing.)

1733
01:10:52,439 --> 01:10:53,639
They're neck and neck.

1734
01:10:54,939 --> 01:10:56,070
(He made a surprise attack.)

1735
01:10:57,740 --> 01:10:59,280
- Gosh.
- He's not falling behind.

1736
01:10:59,280 --> 01:11:01,610
He can't let him get to
his lower body in that situation.

1737
01:11:02,610 --> 01:11:04,710
(Kian84 doesn't fall behind
on his opponent's strength.)

1738
01:11:05,679 --> 01:11:07,580
(He continues charging.)

1739
01:11:07,950 --> 01:11:09,089
Be bold.

1740
01:11:10,490 --> 01:11:11,950
He's clearly... Gosh.

1741
01:11:11,950 --> 01:11:12,990
Nice.

1742
01:11:13,420 --> 01:11:15,389
(Growling)

1743
01:11:15,389 --> 01:11:17,160
He's on fire.

1744
01:11:17,660 --> 01:11:18,660
I wasn't giving in.

1745
01:11:18,660 --> 01:11:20,099
I was sure I was going to win.

1746
01:11:20,530 --> 01:11:21,759
He's so meticulous.

1747
01:11:22,929 --> 01:11:24,830
(Kian84 is out of breath.)

1748
01:11:26,599 --> 01:11:28,439
(They're in a tight confrontation.)

1749
01:11:29,509 --> 01:11:32,240
(He has run out of energy
from the ongoing struggle.)

1750
01:11:33,410 --> 01:11:36,410
(His opponent attempts to
throw Kian84 over his shoulder.)

1751
01:11:39,750 --> 01:11:41,549
(He is thrown on his back without
being able to put up a fight.)

1752
01:11:42,490 --> 01:11:45,019
(Disappointed)

1753
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,160
He still fought well.

1754
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:48,320
(He was full of passion
but lacking in strength by 2 percent.)

1755
01:11:49,689 --> 01:11:51,229
- Do you want to fight again?
- No.

1756
01:11:51,229 --> 01:11:52,229
No.

1757
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:54,059
No?

1758
01:11:54,429 --> 01:11:55,769
I'll get some rest.

1759
01:11:57,030 --> 01:11:58,839
If only I were ten years younger.

1760
01:11:59,599 --> 01:12:02,509
(He's an old boy of 40 years
who is sad about his age.)

1761
01:12:03,110 --> 01:12:05,580
(Dex steps forward right away
for the old boy.)

1762
01:12:05,580 --> 01:12:07,210
- This is the main game.
- Right.

1763
01:12:07,710 --> 01:12:09,009
Gosh, I'm curious.

1764
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:13,049
(Dex's opponent has a healthy build.)

1765
01:12:13,780 --> 01:12:14,950
How to win?

1766
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:17,620
- You have to...
- Down?

1767
01:12:17,620 --> 01:12:18,620
Yes, knock him over.

1768
01:12:18,620 --> 01:12:20,519
- Knock him over. Okay.
- Yes.

1769
01:12:21,519 --> 01:12:23,629
(Speaking of Dex,)

1770
01:12:25,030 --> 01:12:26,559
(he crushes his opponents to death,
no matter who they are.)

1771
01:12:26,559 --> 01:12:29,269
We can't talk about competing
without mentioning Dex.

1772
01:12:29,269 --> 01:12:31,400
(He's a beast covered with muscles.)

1773
01:12:32,269 --> 01:12:34,469
I always aim to give my 200 percent.

1774
01:12:35,099 --> 01:12:36,110
Dex. Gosh.

1775
01:12:36,110 --> 01:12:37,240
(His eyes changed abruptly.)

1776
01:12:38,370 --> 01:12:39,479
Are you ready?

1777
01:12:39,479 --> 01:12:40,740
(He's nervous.)

1778
01:12:42,009 --> 01:12:43,309
Ready? Fight.

1779
01:12:43,309 --> 01:12:44,309
(Come here.)

1780
01:12:44,309 --> 01:12:47,479
Fight. Start fighting.

1781
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,089
(There's tension in the air.)

1782
01:12:51,620 --> 01:12:53,490
(The serious game automatically
makes him become polite.)

1783
01:12:53,860 --> 01:12:55,420
(He attacked him out of nowhere.)

1784
01:12:55,420 --> 01:12:57,460
Right. Don't let him
get to your lower body.

1785
01:12:57,460 --> 01:12:58,660
Dex is fast.

1786
01:12:58,660 --> 01:13:00,129
(He makes a counterattack right away.)

1787
01:13:00,129 --> 01:13:01,129
Gosh, he's good.

1788
01:13:01,530 --> 01:13:03,370
(Seeing the beast's performance
on the sand...)

1789
01:13:03,370 --> 01:13:05,469
I think even the locals are shocked.

1790
01:13:05,969 --> 01:13:07,900
He's insane.

1791
01:13:08,500 --> 01:13:09,509
(He's putting his weight on him.)

1792
01:13:09,509 --> 01:13:11,139
I didn't want to lose,

1793
01:13:11,139 --> 01:13:12,879
so I fought with clenched teeth.

1794
01:13:13,610 --> 01:13:14,809
(His opponent is trying not to get caught.
He's at a disadvantage in this position.)

1795
01:13:14,809 --> 01:13:16,080
- What is he doing?
- Oh, my.

1796
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:17,410
- Okay.
- He's moving frantically.

1797
01:13:17,410 --> 01:13:19,120
Be agile.

1798
01:13:19,620 --> 01:13:21,780
(They're having fun watching it live.)

1799
01:13:22,719 --> 01:13:24,589
(They're spinning around.)

1800
01:13:27,089 --> 01:13:28,160
(He caught him in the par terre position.)

1801
01:13:28,160 --> 01:13:29,189
Yes.

1802
01:13:29,860 --> 01:13:31,259
He got him off the ground.

1803
01:13:31,259 --> 01:13:32,929
(Will Dex be able to flip him over?)

1804
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:38,870
He flipped him over.

1805
01:13:40,969 --> 01:13:42,769
- Gosh. Amazing.
- He did great.

1806
01:13:43,040 --> 01:13:44,070
(A refreshing victory)

1807
01:13:44,070 --> 01:13:45,509
- He won.
- He won right away.

1808
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:46,740
- Dex won.
- He flipped him completely over.

1809
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:48,280
Gosh, Dex.

1810
01:13:48,979 --> 01:13:50,250
The director might want him.

1811
01:13:50,250 --> 01:13:51,450
(The director is impressed
by the emergence of a rookie.)

1812
01:13:52,349 --> 01:13:54,750
(Dex's body is red
from the intense match.)

1813
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:55,820
You're great.

1814
01:13:55,820 --> 01:13:56,849
(His pride was hurt.)

1815
01:13:56,849 --> 01:13:58,820
Nice one.

1816
01:13:59,089 --> 01:14:00,460
Let's go for another round.

1817
01:14:00,820 --> 01:14:02,990
The first match.
Okay, I won the first match.

1818
01:14:02,990 --> 01:14:04,960
I took over this place.

1819
01:14:05,599 --> 01:14:06,860
Let's go for another round.

1820
01:14:06,860 --> 01:14:08,759
(Let's go one more time!)

1821
01:14:09,929 --> 01:14:11,799
You might have used too much
of your strength in the first match.

1822
01:14:13,769 --> 01:14:14,939
Use your power.

1823
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:16,769
(Okay!)

1824
01:14:17,910 --> 01:14:20,780
(His opponent has become bold
after having a taste of defeat.)

1825
01:14:22,139 --> 01:14:23,509
He's on fire.

1826
01:14:27,080 --> 01:14:29,320
(His opponent went for his lower body.)

1827
01:14:29,820 --> 01:14:31,750
(But Dex won't get caught easily.)

1828
01:14:31,750 --> 01:14:32,960
They're so fast.

1829
01:14:34,120 --> 01:14:35,320
(Spinning)

1830
01:14:35,320 --> 01:14:36,530
(This is so exciting.)

1831
01:14:37,089 --> 01:14:38,490
(They keep switching
between offense and defense...)

1832
01:14:38,490 --> 01:14:39,530
He's so agile.

1833
01:14:40,099 --> 01:14:42,370
(in this intense match.)

1834
01:14:43,500 --> 01:14:44,500
(Is he going for Dex's lower body again?)

1835
01:14:44,500 --> 01:14:46,299
(It was a fake move.)

1836
01:14:48,639 --> 01:14:50,540
(After faking it,
he actually went for his lower body.)

1837
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:53,110
- He has to withstand it.
- Withstand it.

1838
01:14:53,110 --> 01:14:54,210
(He has to withstand it.)

1839
01:14:54,210 --> 01:14:55,280
Will he be able to?

1840
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:57,910
(Will he be able to?)

1841
01:14:58,580 --> 01:15:00,879
(He went for the arm
that was withstanding him.)

1842
01:15:02,019 --> 01:15:03,519
(Dex lost as he lost his balance.)

1843
01:15:03,519 --> 01:15:06,290
- His technique was...
- His technique is amazing.

1844
01:15:06,589 --> 01:15:07,689
It's a tie.

1845
01:15:07,689 --> 01:15:10,660
Okay. Gosh.

1846
01:15:11,189 --> 01:15:13,599
This isn't what we're used to
seeing from you.

1847
01:15:15,429 --> 01:15:17,830
(The beast is breathing heavily
from exhaustion.)

1848
01:15:18,570 --> 01:15:20,469
(His opponent is exhausted too.)

1849
01:15:22,139 --> 01:15:23,139
You...

1850
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:24,839
You want?

1851
01:15:24,969 --> 01:15:27,710
He's always ready to fight if you want to.

1852
01:15:27,710 --> 01:15:28,780
What?

1853
01:15:29,450 --> 01:15:32,210
(Nodding)

1854
01:15:32,210 --> 01:15:34,320
You're fine?

1855
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:35,379
Ready?

1856
01:15:35,379 --> 01:15:37,420
(The word "tie" is not in my dictionary.)

1857
01:15:37,420 --> 01:15:39,120
- Okay.
- He's strong-willed.

1858
01:15:39,820 --> 01:15:42,960
As I was fighting,

1859
01:15:43,229 --> 01:15:45,629
I felt a rush of adrenaline.

1860
01:15:45,629 --> 01:15:47,400
I wanted to win no matter what.

1861
01:15:48,059 --> 01:15:50,670
- I was heating up inside.
- Gosh.

1862
01:15:51,030 --> 01:15:52,400
He's extremely competitive.

1863
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:54,500
He's extremely competitive.

1864
01:15:55,370 --> 01:15:57,670
(Their pride is on the line
in this last round.)

1865
01:15:58,110 --> 01:15:59,540
(This round decides who wins.)

1866
01:15:59,540 --> 01:16:00,580
Good.

1867
01:16:00,580 --> 01:16:01,839
(His opponent makes a preemptive attack.)

1868
01:16:01,839 --> 01:16:04,349
- He has zero hesitation.
- My opponent is enthusiastic too.

1869
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,219
(His opponent keeps charging at him.)

1870
01:16:08,719 --> 01:16:11,420
Dex is defending himself really well.

1871
01:16:11,920 --> 01:16:13,219
(He went for his opponent's
lower body by surprise.)

1872
01:16:13,219 --> 01:16:14,889
- He caught him.
- Nice.

1873
01:16:14,889 --> 01:16:16,059
Let's flip him.

1874
01:16:16,059 --> 01:16:17,229
Aim for the final blow.

1875
01:16:17,229 --> 01:16:19,660
(Will he be able to make that final blow?)

1876
01:16:20,629 --> 01:16:21,660
Yes.

1877
01:16:21,660 --> 01:16:22,929
(But his opponent held out.)

1878
01:16:22,929 --> 01:16:24,870
Gosh, it wasn't easy.

1879
01:16:25,070 --> 01:16:27,400
His balance is great.

1880
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:28,469
(Right then,)

1881
01:16:29,040 --> 01:16:30,969
(he went for Dex's
lower body by surprise.)

1882
01:16:31,240 --> 01:16:32,809
(Dex is trying to hold out
with all his might.)

1883
01:16:33,280 --> 01:16:34,979
(He lifts Dex.)

1884
01:16:35,439 --> 01:16:36,509
What?

1885
01:16:37,080 --> 01:16:38,210
He lifted him?

1886
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:41,719
- What? He's lifting him?
- Gosh.

1887
01:16:41,849 --> 01:16:43,450
- Gosh.
- That's where... Goodness.

1888
01:16:43,450 --> 01:16:44,889
(Dex is thrown on his back,
just like that.)

1889
01:16:45,150 --> 01:16:46,719
It was a good fight. Gosh.

1890
01:16:46,820 --> 01:16:48,219
- That was amazing.
- Dex.

1891
01:16:48,219 --> 01:16:49,360
(Such a disappointing defeat)

1892
01:16:50,629 --> 01:16:52,799
(He's still commendable.)

1893
01:16:52,799 --> 01:16:55,030
He was very good.

1894
01:16:55,030 --> 01:16:56,830
- You win.
- Yes.

1895
01:16:57,500 --> 01:16:59,099
Nice fight.

1896
01:16:59,099 --> 01:17:00,339
Watching this now,
I'm still disappointed by it.

1897
01:17:02,240 --> 01:17:04,540
- This is a bit of a spoiler, but...
- Yes.

1898
01:17:05,139 --> 01:17:07,939
he fights again
where it's not a wrestling arena.

1899
01:17:08,080 --> 01:17:09,280
- Dex?
- Yes.

1900
01:17:09,509 --> 01:17:10,549
Really?

1901
01:17:10,549 --> 01:17:12,150
(A surprise spoiler:
The story of how he got a taste of blood)

1902
01:17:12,519 --> 01:17:14,950
But doesn't fighting where
it's not a wrestling arena...

1903
01:17:14,950 --> 01:17:16,189
make someone a gangster?

1904
01:17:16,849 --> 01:17:18,420
No, I'm sorry.

1905
01:17:18,420 --> 01:17:20,059
It was like a sneeze. I didn't mean to.

1906
01:17:20,059 --> 01:17:21,290
So it's not in a ring.

1907
01:17:21,290 --> 01:17:23,729
That's when I realized
how passionate he is.

1908
01:17:24,559 --> 01:17:25,759
- "Dex is passionate."
- I...

1909
01:17:25,759 --> 01:17:29,370
always think about how there are
so many strong people in the world.

1910
01:17:29,370 --> 01:17:33,099
So I wanted to experience
how strong Indians are.

1911
01:17:33,099 --> 01:17:34,769
A bit like Mas Oyama.

1912
01:17:35,599 --> 01:17:37,439
- So you were there to beat the masters.
- It's sports mentality.

1913
01:17:37,439 --> 01:17:38,570
- To beat the Masters.
- It's sports mentality.

1914
01:17:38,570 --> 01:17:39,939
It's not about winning for me.

1915
01:17:39,939 --> 01:17:42,750
Rather, I think I learn a lot of things
when I lose.

1916
01:17:43,280 --> 01:17:47,150
(But he looks a bit bitter from the back.)

1917
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:50,349
It's not like lifting weights.

1918
01:17:50,349 --> 01:17:51,519
(He sits down feebly.)

1919
01:17:51,519 --> 01:17:53,920
This is cute.

1920
01:17:55,120 --> 01:17:56,360
(Chuckling)

1921
01:17:56,360 --> 01:17:57,389
This is just...

1922
01:17:57,389 --> 01:17:58,429
(He's checking the weights for no reason.)

1923
01:17:59,330 --> 01:18:01,629
(He's taking out his anger
on the wrong thing.)

1924
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:04,599
(It's been a while since he's
last had the bitter taste of defeat.)

1925
01:18:04,599 --> 01:18:05,729
This is too...

1926
01:18:05,729 --> 01:18:08,339
Using only one hand is dangerous.

1927
01:18:09,469 --> 01:18:12,040
When someone says something is dangerous,
it makes me want to do it even more.

1928
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,280
Be careful.

1929
01:18:13,280 --> 01:18:14,639
There's no stopping you.

1930
01:18:14,639 --> 01:18:16,049
(He stubbornly uses one hand
despite Kian84's dissuasion.)

1931
01:18:16,049 --> 01:18:17,110
Gosh.

1932
01:18:17,110 --> 01:18:18,879
(He's in a fit of anger.)

1933
01:18:19,479 --> 01:18:23,450
He's taking his anger out.
His competitiveness made his blood boil.

1934
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:25,860
What good does this do?

1935
01:18:26,420 --> 01:18:28,189
- I lost all the wrestling matches.
- Right.

1936
01:18:28,889 --> 01:18:30,660
- My pride was hurt.
- My pride is hurt.

1937
01:18:30,660 --> 01:18:31,729
Really?

1938
01:18:31,729 --> 01:18:34,030
Didn't you say
it's about learning for you, earlier?

1939
01:18:34,500 --> 01:18:37,700
(His words don't match his actions.)

1940
01:18:38,500 --> 01:18:40,339
Hey, those people
are professional players.

1941
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:42,509
Gosh, my pride is hurt.

1942
01:18:43,339 --> 01:18:45,240
Since I have a competitive nature,

1943
01:18:45,240 --> 01:18:47,280
it was a little upsetting.

1944
01:18:48,009 --> 01:18:49,910
I wanted to crush them.

1945
01:18:50,049 --> 01:18:51,479
He didn't even use force.

1946
01:18:51,479 --> 01:18:52,549
Really?

1947
01:18:52,549 --> 01:18:54,080
He didn't even use force
in the first round.

1948
01:18:54,450 --> 01:18:55,580
It does hurt your pride.

1949
01:18:56,049 --> 01:18:57,189
You did your best.

1950
01:18:57,189 --> 01:18:59,219
- I did my very best.
- You did your best, but...

1951
01:18:59,219 --> 01:19:00,389
he didn't even use force?

1952
01:19:00,389 --> 01:19:02,290
(Kian84 is getting on Dex's nerves,
when he's upset.)

1953
01:19:02,629 --> 01:19:03,860
Hey, ask him to do another round later.

1954
01:19:03,860 --> 01:19:05,900
- Should I?
- Ask him to do another round later.

1955
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,259
Gosh, my pride is hurt.

1956
01:19:08,259 --> 01:19:09,769
His anger won't go away.

1957
01:19:09,769 --> 01:19:11,629
He looks really angry.

1958
01:19:11,629 --> 01:19:12,769
Gosh.

1959
01:19:13,269 --> 01:19:14,370
He's coming this way.

1960
01:19:14,870 --> 01:19:15,910
That punk.

1961
01:19:16,910 --> 01:19:18,610
I held quite a grudge.

1962
01:19:19,509 --> 01:19:20,979
(He's taking a good look at the man.)

1963
01:19:20,979 --> 01:19:23,049
Your body fat percentage is much lower.

1964
01:19:24,650 --> 01:19:26,879
Hey, you still won in terms
of body fat percentage.

1965
01:19:26,879 --> 01:19:29,120
- He's trying to make you feel better.
- He's saying anything to comfort you.

1966
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:31,019
- Yes.
- Yes. How warm-hearted.

1967
01:19:32,420 --> 01:19:33,759
Your body is prettier.

1968
01:19:33,759 --> 01:19:34,759
(He lost when he just came by
to wash his feet.)

1969
01:19:35,790 --> 01:19:37,389
Where's my protein shake?

1970
01:19:38,689 --> 01:19:40,200
(He's making himself a protein shake.)

1971
01:19:40,200 --> 01:19:41,960
Gosh. You have protein shakes?

1972
01:19:41,960 --> 01:19:43,900
- I brought it from home.
- You brought it from home?

1973
01:19:43,900 --> 01:19:45,330
- In a zipper bag?
- Isn't that soil?

1974
01:19:45,330 --> 01:19:47,269
Isn't that the soil here?

1975
01:19:47,570 --> 01:19:48,639
It looks the same.

1976
01:19:48,639 --> 01:19:49,769
(He's going to drink a protein shake
to stabilize his mind and body.)

1977
01:19:50,170 --> 01:19:51,870
- Looking at it...
- Do you know how old he is?

1978
01:19:52,910 --> 01:19:55,009
- It's fine as long as he's not a minor.
- He is a minor.

1979
01:19:55,339 --> 01:19:56,379
(He's taken aback.)

1980
01:19:56,379 --> 01:19:59,110
- They're kids?
- The one you fought with is 17.

1981
01:19:59,110 --> 01:20:00,580
The one I fought with is 15.

1982
01:20:00,580 --> 01:20:01,920
(Middle schooler, 15 years old,
high schooler, 17 years old)

1983
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:03,219
I asked them.

1984
01:20:03,719 --> 01:20:05,049
- You're lying.
- It's true.

1985
01:20:05,049 --> 01:20:06,990
He has a mustache. How can he be 17?

1986
01:20:06,990 --> 01:20:09,530
He's 17. Secondary sex characteristics
appear earlier for boys.

1987
01:20:10,030 --> 01:20:11,030
(He's miserable because
of this unbelievable reality.)

1988
01:20:11,030 --> 01:20:12,189
Gosh, my pride is hurt.

1989
01:20:13,160 --> 01:20:14,530
I lost to a kid in high school,

1990
01:20:14,530 --> 01:20:17,170
- and you lost to a kid in middle school?
- A kid in middle school.

1991
01:20:17,929 --> 01:20:18,969
Age is their weapon.

1992
01:20:18,969 --> 01:20:20,339
There are so many strong people
in the world.

1993
01:20:20,339 --> 01:20:21,670
This is why we have to work out.

1994
01:20:21,670 --> 01:20:23,839
You should feel the fact that
strong people are all over the place...

1995
01:20:24,240 --> 01:20:25,509
through your body.

1996
01:20:25,670 --> 01:20:27,879
The one you fought with
is in middle school?

1997
01:20:27,879 --> 01:20:29,679
- No way.
- Yes.

1998
01:20:29,679 --> 01:20:31,110
I'm telling the truth.

1999
01:20:31,309 --> 01:20:32,450
I should go and ask.

2000
01:20:34,219 --> 01:20:35,250
This makes you strong.

2001
01:20:35,719 --> 01:20:37,620
(He's sharing his protein shake first.)

2002
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:38,689
Gosh.

2003
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:40,820
Drink up.

2004
01:20:42,259 --> 01:20:43,559
You're in middle school?

2005
01:20:43,790 --> 01:20:44,990
(Nodding)

2006
01:20:44,990 --> 01:20:46,500
Middle school? You're in middle school?

2007
01:20:46,799 --> 01:20:48,229
- I fought with a kid in middle school.
- In middle school.

2008
01:20:48,229 --> 01:20:49,259
Really?

2009
01:20:49,259 --> 01:20:51,370
He's in the below-76kg division,

2010
01:20:51,370 --> 01:20:53,700
and he's a 17-time state champion.

2011
01:20:53,700 --> 01:20:56,070
- Gosh, he's a champion?
- Champion?

2012
01:20:56,070 --> 01:20:58,610
I fought against a champion
and won the first round.

2013
01:20:58,670 --> 01:20:59,939
(Hugging)

2014
01:20:59,939 --> 01:21:02,509
- You're unbelievable.
- What's with the mental victory?

2015
01:21:02,509 --> 01:21:04,950
- Mental victory.
- He's also a champion.

2016
01:21:04,950 --> 01:21:06,580
He's a champion
in another weight division.

2017
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:07,620
Champion.

2018
01:21:07,620 --> 01:21:09,589
- He's a champion?
- Gosh, no wonder he was good.

2019
01:21:09,719 --> 01:21:11,389
I'm glad my death was honorable.

2020
01:21:11,689 --> 01:21:13,719
Are you the number one
of the 80kg division?

2021
01:21:14,089 --> 01:21:16,089
When these kids are fighting in a match,

2022
01:21:16,089 --> 01:21:18,030
they're very professional.

2023
01:21:18,030 --> 01:21:20,860
But when you see them after the match
is over, they just seem their age.

2024
01:21:20,860 --> 01:21:22,729
- Kids in middle school and high school.
- Yes. Innocent.

2025
01:21:22,729 --> 01:21:24,000
And they seem very pure.

2026
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:25,700
No. He did not look like
he was in high school.

2027
01:21:26,700 --> 01:21:28,439
(Middle schooler, 15 years old,
high schooler, 17 years old)

2028
01:21:28,439 --> 01:21:29,670
Seriously.

2029
01:21:30,139 --> 01:21:33,179
(Dex hugs him
after having a mental victory.)

2030
01:21:33,780 --> 01:21:35,879
Can we all take a picture together?

2031
01:21:35,879 --> 01:21:37,150
I think Dex likes it here.

2032
01:21:37,150 --> 01:21:39,080
- All together.
- All together?

2033
01:21:39,150 --> 01:21:40,549
Meeting athletes...

2034
01:21:41,019 --> 01:21:42,679
(All the athletes came over together.)

2035
01:21:42,679 --> 01:21:44,820
I sweat so much.

2036
01:21:45,450 --> 01:21:46,889
(Lifting)

2037
01:21:46,889 --> 01:21:48,120
Take off your shirts. That's right.

2038
01:21:48,120 --> 01:21:49,120
(Everyone together)

2039
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:50,490
Come on!

2040
01:21:50,490 --> 01:21:52,259
You're very social.

2041
01:21:52,259 --> 01:21:54,500
I think that's the advantage of sports.

2042
01:21:54,500 --> 01:21:55,960
- Right.
- In a short period of time.

2043
01:21:55,960 --> 01:21:57,070
- Sweating together.
- Yes.

2044
01:21:57,070 --> 01:21:58,629
- This is what happens.
- Right.

2045
01:21:58,629 --> 01:21:59,700
Okay.

2046
01:22:00,939 --> 01:22:02,540
- Fight.
- In Kim Dong Hyun's pose.

2047
01:22:02,540 --> 01:22:03,670
(Little Kim Dong Hyun
is spreading the pose.)

2048
01:22:08,610 --> 01:22:12,009
(Who is that?)

2049
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:14,479
Gosh, you're unrivaled.

2050
01:22:14,479 --> 01:22:16,189
You stand out so much.

2051
01:22:16,189 --> 01:22:18,049
The theme was fitness.

2052
01:22:19,150 --> 01:22:20,620
(With an unidentified fitness pose)

2053
01:22:20,620 --> 01:22:22,589
Shouting, okay?

2054
01:22:23,129 --> 01:22:25,460
(Shouting)

2055
01:22:25,790 --> 01:22:27,900
(Everyone is squeezing their bodies.)

2056
01:22:32,530 --> 01:22:33,969
So who is Mr. Korea?

2057
01:22:33,969 --> 01:22:35,170
I'm in a different genre.

2058
01:22:35,170 --> 01:22:36,509
- Oh, my goodness.
- My head...

2059
01:22:37,910 --> 01:22:40,110
(Once they're done taking pictures where
everyone was squeezing their bodies,)

2060
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:42,710
(it's time to politely say goodbye.)

2061
01:22:42,710 --> 01:22:44,080
He's doing it politely.

2062
01:22:44,679 --> 01:22:46,420
(Goodbye!)

2063
01:22:46,519 --> 01:22:49,379
- Have fun.
- Have fun.

2064
01:22:53,160 --> 01:22:54,490
Gosh. So...

2065
01:22:54,660 --> 01:22:56,629
how does it feel to lose
to a middle school student?

2066
01:22:56,629 --> 01:22:59,229
- You lost too. Why do you keep...
- There are many strong people...

2067
01:22:59,229 --> 01:23:00,830
- Yes.
- in the world, and we should be humble.

2068
01:23:00,830 --> 01:23:03,599
- I keep talking about strong people.
- Your theory of strong people.

2069
01:23:03,599 --> 01:23:06,639
He's a man who wants to fight strong
people but doesn't like masters.

2070
01:23:06,639 --> 01:23:08,070
He said he's number two at his school.

2071
01:23:08,139 --> 01:23:09,939
- Number two?
- Yes. Someone else is number one.

2072
01:23:09,939 --> 01:23:12,610
- Really?
- Yes. There's someone stronger than him.

2073
01:23:12,610 --> 01:23:13,910
So not only did I lose,
I lost to a number two.

2074
01:23:13,910 --> 01:23:15,610
It would have been nice
if I lost to a number one.

2075
01:23:18,009 --> 01:23:21,580
Here, let's...
Mother Ganga is waiting for us.

2076
01:23:21,580 --> 01:23:22,620
Yes.

2077
01:23:23,019 --> 01:23:24,019
Can you see it?

2078
01:23:24,019 --> 01:23:25,189
(Mother, I brought Dex.)

2079
01:23:26,019 --> 01:23:27,719
(Come in!)

2080
01:23:27,820 --> 01:23:29,460
Are there professional swimmers there now?

2081
01:23:29,460 --> 01:23:31,360
- Why don't we take a swim?
- Let's go.

2082
01:23:31,689 --> 01:23:36,059
(Will Dex go into
Mother Ganga's arms too?)

2083
01:23:36,799 --> 01:23:38,700
(Along with the very excited Kian84,)

2084
01:23:38,700 --> 01:23:40,370
(he jumps into Mother Ganga's arms.)

2085
01:23:41,139 --> 01:23:43,910
(Her first son and second son
are excited to meet their mom.)

2086
01:23:44,469 --> 01:23:45,870
(Before they knew it,
the two have become one with India.)

2087
01:23:46,379 --> 01:23:48,139
(Their brotherly love
has been heated by tanning.)

2088
01:23:48,479 --> 01:23:51,610
(But who are these people
that block their way?)

2089
01:23:51,950 --> 01:23:53,049
(They won't tell me how much it is.)

2090
01:23:53,519 --> 01:23:55,120
(Resembling an ant hill,)

2091
01:23:55,250 --> 01:23:57,349
(it's an attack by
a luxurious group of masseurs.)

2092
01:23:57,620 --> 01:23:59,519
(Even a manly man would shed tears...)

2093
01:23:59,759 --> 01:24:01,219
(in this ordeal of massages.)

2094
01:24:03,059 --> 01:24:04,860
(Meanwhile, he's experiencing
healing, ultimate bliss, and peace.)

2095
01:24:05,259 --> 01:24:06,259
(This is great!)

2096
01:24:06,700 --> 01:24:09,870
(Kian84 is benevolent to monkeys.)

2097
01:24:10,330 --> 01:24:11,330
(Hi!)

2098
01:24:11,830 --> 01:24:13,269
Oh, no.

2099
01:24:13,700 --> 01:24:15,400
(The monkey pooped.)

2100
01:24:15,400 --> 01:24:16,410
(Dex is still keeping
his distance from them.)

2101
01:24:16,410 --> 01:24:17,769
(I want to go home.)

2102
01:24:17,969 --> 01:24:20,110
(Not today. We have to go to a wedding.)

2103
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:23,549
(They are new to Indian wedding culture.)

2104
01:24:23,710 --> 01:24:25,009
(When we came to the wedding...)

2105
01:24:25,009 --> 01:24:26,719
(Loud dance music is playing.)

2106
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:29,820
(Why are they playing
club music at a wedding?)

2107
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,019
(Why did I come here?)

2108
01:24:31,389 --> 01:24:34,559
(You came here to dance!)

2109
01:24:34,689 --> 01:24:36,089
(I'm so popular!)

2110
01:24:36,530 --> 01:24:38,960
(Bollywood84 is drunk on joy.)

2111
01:24:39,599 --> 01:24:41,030
(Dex can't get used to this.)

2112
01:24:41,330 --> 01:24:43,900
(Did Kian84 become
a superstar all of a sudden?)

2113
01:24:44,400 --> 01:24:45,830
(India is obsessed with Kian84
who fits right in.)

2114
01:24:46,170 --> 01:24:48,000
(Dex is an outsider
who can't adjust to India.)

2115
01:24:48,540 --> 01:24:51,009
(What will the chemistry between the two
be like as they travel to India?)

2116
01:24:52,240 --> 01:24:55,240
(Adventure by Accident 2)
