1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,540
We're greeting you in a new space.

2
00:00:02,540 --> 00:00:05,009
Look at these military decorations...

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:07,750
- and cool exercise equipment.
- Oh, my.

4
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,749
You can all guess whose house this is,

5
00:00:10,749 --> 00:00:12,450
even without me telling you, right?

6
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:13,690
- Yes.
- Yes.

7
00:00:14,249 --> 00:00:15,990
- It's so intense over there.
- Right.

8
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:17,720
- If you just look over here...
- Oh, my.

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:19,659
It's the house of a special forces agent.

10
00:00:19,659 --> 00:00:21,129
Please tell us about it. It's so cool.

11
00:00:21,129 --> 00:00:22,960
When I was discharged,

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:24,900
I received this plaque from the UDT.

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,830
- My team members made this for me.
- I see.

14
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:30,069
- This was from my unit.
- I see.

15
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:31,800
- Oh, my.
- How cool.

16
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,140
(Babyface)

17
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,209
(Welcome to Dex's house.)

18
00:00:39,479 --> 00:00:40,849
- This is my house.
- Yes.

19
00:00:40,849 --> 00:00:43,050
I hope you can feel comfortable here.

20
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:44,379
- Sounds good.
- Sounds good.

21
00:00:44,379 --> 00:00:46,180
I don't see Pani Bottle today.

22
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,489
- Right. Pani Bottle isn't here.
- Again?

23
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:49,290
Pani Bottle had such good reactions.

24
00:00:49,290 --> 00:00:50,720
- When I watched the show,
- Yes.

25
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,989
I saw he had such hearty laughs.
I like that kind of reaction.

26
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:57,099
(Laughing)

27
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,930
- I'm a bit sad.
- Seriously.

28
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,629
Do you know where Pani Bottle went?

29
00:01:00,629 --> 00:01:02,500
- He's in Phuket right now.
- Oh, my.

30
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,739
- Phuket?
- Phuket sounds nice.

31
00:01:03,739 --> 00:01:04,739
(Glancing over)

32
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,470
- Pani Bottle is over here.
- There's Pani Bottle.

33
00:01:07,470 --> 00:01:10,179
Oh, it changed. The color changed.
It used to be red.

34
00:01:10,179 --> 00:01:11,539
(Old Pani Bottle,
Pani Bottle in new clothes)

35
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,179
- You're right.
- Is he a ghost?

36
00:01:13,179 --> 00:01:14,649
Why does he always transform
into that kind of thing?

37
00:01:14,709 --> 00:01:16,509
Pani Bottle isn't here right now,

38
00:01:16,509 --> 00:01:19,379
but we can finally see Pani Bottle
in the videos now.

39
00:01:19,379 --> 00:01:21,090
- Finally.
- That's for sure, right?

40
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:22,149
Yes.

41
00:01:22,149 --> 00:01:23,489
(Pani Bottle is coming soon.)

42
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,659
(Varanasi Station, Departed at 4 p.m.,
Estimated arrival at 4 a.m.)

43
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:57,490
(Total traveled distance 792km,
4 hours since departure)

44
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,659
- Gosh. How grueling.
- That's such a long trip.

45
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,930
(Day 4 of the India trip)

46
00:03:06,969 --> 00:03:08,400
(The salesmen walk around and sell food.)

47
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,309
I guess they sell meals and such?

48
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:11,809
We hadn't eaten dinner.

49
00:03:12,639 --> 00:03:14,880
- Excuse me. So...
- Right.

50
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,510
- Thank you. Dinner.
- Dinner?

51
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,980
- It's 260.
- Oh, 260?

52
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:22,480
- Oh, okay. Thank you.
- It's around 2 dollars for one.

53
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:25,620
(What? But...)

54
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,859
I can't eat
because I don't have much space.

55
00:03:29,189 --> 00:03:31,829
You're sitting at the edge
in an unstable way.

56
00:03:31,829 --> 00:03:34,499
- Right. I couldn't eat there.
- Right.

57
00:03:34,499 --> 00:03:35,700
I don't know what to do.

58
00:03:38,299 --> 00:03:40,070
(Get up.)

59
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:42,970
(Oh, it's already getting late.)

60
00:03:43,609 --> 00:03:44,869
(Oh, nice.)

61
00:03:44,869 --> 00:03:46,980
You can fold out this middle one.

62
00:03:47,179 --> 00:03:49,010
- What? The middle one? Okay.
- This middle one.

63
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:51,350
This was originally your seat.

64
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:54,280
There's no set time, right?
It's not like you have to open at 8 p.m.

65
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:57,220
It didn't seem like it,
but people naturally did so.

66
00:03:57,220 --> 00:03:58,649
- Yes.
- That's interesting.

67
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,560
Okay, mother. Sorry.

68
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,859
- Sorry.
- We need to sleep.

69
00:04:02,389 --> 00:04:04,429
- Sorry.
- Oh, the backrest?

70
00:04:04,429 --> 00:04:07,130
- Yes. That becomes the middle seat.
- I see.

71
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:08,899
(Fastening it with a chain)

72
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:12,000
Since we didn't know how to do it,
the people next to us did it for us.

73
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,769
They told us
we had to fold it out to sleep.

74
00:04:14,769 --> 00:04:15,839
(The local passengers got up and helped.)

75
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:17,940
Oh, thank you.

76
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,910
(Feeling antsy)

77
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,549
Oh, this is so...

78
00:04:24,049 --> 00:04:26,350
I paid money to ride this,
but I feel bad for some reason.

79
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,380
- Seriously.
- Seriously.

80
00:04:28,380 --> 00:04:31,019
- I felt bad waking someone up.
- Right.

81
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,649
(Coughing)

82
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,989
I feel bad.

83
00:04:33,989 --> 00:04:35,089
(Choking up from feeling bad)

84
00:04:35,089 --> 00:04:38,060
I paid money, but...
It's like I paid to feel bad.

85
00:04:38,130 --> 00:04:40,829
- You paid to feel bad.
- You paid to feel bad.

86
00:04:40,829 --> 00:04:44,530
- There was a guy next to us.
- Right.

87
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,839
He slept on the floor in the middle there.

88
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:48,239
- Oh, my.
- Really?

89
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:51,109
Okay. We got it.

90
00:04:51,109 --> 00:04:52,910
- You got it?
- I think this should work.

91
00:04:52,910 --> 00:04:54,609
- You got it? Okay.
- I'm okay.

92
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:55,980
I got it.

93
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,480
(Opening his meal)

94
00:05:01,820 --> 00:05:03,519
It was totally local food.

95
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,019
Seriously.

96
00:05:05,019 --> 00:05:07,519
- Three types of curry.
- It was totally local.

97
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,519
- I see.
- That looks good.

98
00:05:08,989 --> 00:05:10,760
(What is this?)

99
00:05:11,329 --> 00:05:13,329
(An unidentifiable sauce)

100
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,859
(Pouring it on the rice
without hesitation...)

101
00:05:15,859 --> 00:05:17,100
(Licking it)

102
00:05:17,630 --> 00:05:20,470
(Mixing)

103
00:05:21,700 --> 00:05:24,209
- Using your fingers, Indian style.
- There wasn't much space.

104
00:05:25,010 --> 00:05:27,639
(Ambitiously taking a bite)

105
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,709
You just spilled half of it.

106
00:05:29,709 --> 00:05:30,780
(Falling off)

107
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:32,209
Because the train was shaking.

108
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:33,950
(Eating while lying on one's stomach
is quite difficult.)

109
00:05:33,950 --> 00:05:36,049
Oh, gosh. How can you eat like that?

110
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:39,220
(He ate on the floor...)

111
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:41,589
(and even on the street,)

112
00:05:42,290 --> 00:05:44,889
(but he has never eaten
while lying on his stomach before.)

113
00:05:44,889 --> 00:05:47,360
It looks like a pupa eating.

114
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:49,130
- Right.
- This is next-level.

115
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,200
Seriously.

116
00:05:50,670 --> 00:05:53,000
(Shoving food into his mouth
with difficulty)

117
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,440
(Gosh)

118
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,909
The sauce tastes a bit...

119
00:06:00,139 --> 00:06:02,039
- It tastes like medicine.
- Is it good, Kian84?

120
00:06:02,039 --> 00:06:03,579
- Don't eat the sauce.
- What?

121
00:06:03,579 --> 00:06:05,209
- Don't eat this.
- That?

122
00:06:05,610 --> 00:06:06,950
It tastes like medicine.

123
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,979
Medicine.

124
00:06:09,719 --> 00:06:11,950
(A bite of medicine rice)

125
00:06:11,950 --> 00:06:15,719
(A bite of curry)

126
00:06:16,659 --> 00:06:19,089
(Grimacing)

127
00:06:19,089 --> 00:06:21,159
Was it very different from the curry
you ate in the restaurant?

128
00:06:21,159 --> 00:06:22,430
It was different. It was curry,

129
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,930
- but it felt a bit sour and bitter.
- I see.

130
00:06:26,130 --> 00:06:27,969
Would it be like a foreigner...

131
00:06:27,969 --> 00:06:29,539
eating fermented soybean paste stew
in Korea?

132
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:30,810
- That could be.
- It could be.

133
00:06:30,810 --> 00:06:32,440
The smell was so strong.

134
00:06:33,110 --> 00:06:34,310
(Broken)

135
00:06:34,310 --> 00:06:35,409
What's wrong with this?

136
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,250
Is it difficult?

137
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:38,779
Just eat the rice.

138
00:06:38,979 --> 00:06:41,180
How strong does it taste
if it's difficult for you?

139
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,750
I'm eating to live.

140
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:46,420
I really ate because I was hungry.

141
00:06:46,889 --> 00:06:49,190
- Just trying to eat somehow.
- That's so hard.

142
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,760
(Glancing over)

143
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:55,459
(Looking around,)

144
00:06:55,459 --> 00:06:56,630
(then eating with his hands)

145
00:06:56,630 --> 00:06:57,630
Gosh.

146
00:06:57,630 --> 00:06:59,370
Why are you looking around as you eat?

147
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,399
Is someone coming after you?

148
00:07:00,399 --> 00:07:02,139
It's like when the character
in "Parasite" eats quickly...

149
00:07:02,139 --> 00:07:04,740
- before the owners come home.
- The person living in the basement.

150
00:07:05,740 --> 00:07:08,409
(Eating with his hands)

151
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,709
(Eating quickly like a person in hiding)

152
00:07:12,050 --> 00:07:13,209
(Sucking the food from his finger)

153
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:16,349
(Oh, Kian84...)

154
00:07:16,349 --> 00:07:17,589
I'm eating to live.

155
00:07:17,589 --> 00:07:19,320
(You must've meant
you were going to live on this train.)

156
00:07:21,060 --> 00:07:22,959
Still, he's eating quite well.

157
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:24,589
(Eating on the train
since he happened to be born)

158
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:26,029
(Train Life84)

159
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:28,130
- Train Life84.
- What is Train Life84?

160
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:30,170
(Train Life84)

161
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,529
Respect!

162
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:33,099
(You still love India, right?)

163
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,300
(Satisfied)

164
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,039
(Humming)

165
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:42,180
(Following Kian84,
Dex takes a bite while humming)

166
00:07:45,250 --> 00:07:46,380
Oh, cilantro. Oh, my.

167
00:07:47,219 --> 00:07:48,779
(Cilantro hater)

168
00:07:48,779 --> 00:07:50,079
- The cilantro was so...
- I see.

169
00:07:50,079 --> 00:07:51,550
- Cilantro.
- It had cilantro?

170
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,649
I can't do this.

171
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:55,320
Okay. I lost.

172
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,389
I admit my defeat.

173
00:07:57,389 --> 00:07:59,430
I really couldn't eat it.

174
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,659
You didn't eat at all.

175
00:08:01,659 --> 00:08:02,700
(Oh, no.)

176
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,430
Gosh. I can't eat either.

177
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,539
You ate all of the rice.

178
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:09,269
- Yes.
- I'm glad you ate.

179
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:12,070
(Kian84 leaves his seat
to throw away his empty bowl.)

180
00:08:12,870 --> 00:08:15,279
(Dex gets his big bag out.)

181
00:08:15,709 --> 00:08:16,709
(What is that?)

182
00:08:16,709 --> 00:08:18,649
- Oh, he was in the seat above you.
- Yes.

183
00:08:18,649 --> 00:08:20,110
He wants to get close to you.

184
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,750
(Ambitiously taking out...)

185
00:08:24,750 --> 00:08:26,990
(the secret weapon he brought from Korea)

186
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:27,990
What is that?

187
00:08:27,990 --> 00:08:29,889
(Combat rations)

188
00:08:29,889 --> 00:08:31,229
I thought this might happen,

189
00:08:31,229 --> 00:08:33,899
- so I brought combat rations from Korea.
- I see.

190
00:08:33,899 --> 00:08:35,229
You did a good job.

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,529
(Tasty food)

192
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,229
(I'm going to eat it)

193
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:41,000
(No matter what)

194
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,570
(I'm going to eat it)

195
00:08:43,769 --> 00:08:44,909
Oh, it's hot.

196
00:08:45,409 --> 00:08:47,779
Oh, it's hot.

197
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,180
Oh, it's hot.

198
00:08:49,979 --> 00:08:51,110
(Preparing the combat rations
in the noisiest way)

199
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,709
Oh, it's hot.

200
00:08:52,709 --> 00:08:53,880
(Little Dex)

201
00:08:54,180 --> 00:08:55,579
Okay.

202
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,620
Hey, Dex.

203
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,389
You can't eat it at all, right?

204
00:09:01,719 --> 00:09:03,789
I shouldn't leave food,

205
00:09:03,789 --> 00:09:05,459
but it's difficult.

206
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,789
If you force yourself to eat,
you'll get sick.

207
00:09:07,599 --> 00:09:09,930
(It's as easy as drinking water for me.)

208
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:11,469
I'm going to sleep.

209
00:09:11,469 --> 00:09:12,670
- Okay. Sleep well, Kian84.
- Okay.

210
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,269
The time right now...

211
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,570
is 8:30 p.m.

212
00:09:20,010 --> 00:09:22,579
I think they'll turn off the lights
at 9 p.m. so people can sleep.

213
00:09:23,180 --> 00:09:24,310
Other than the top bunk being low,

214
00:09:24,310 --> 00:09:26,149
it's not as bad to sleep in as I expected.

215
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:27,649
But this person has their feet too...

216
00:09:27,649 --> 00:09:28,649
Oh, that scared me.

217
00:09:28,649 --> 00:09:30,079
(Someone else's feet
are right in front of Kian84's face.)

218
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:31,389
He's playing peekaboo.

219
00:09:31,389 --> 00:09:32,620
He's taking his feet away.

220
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,120
Oh, no. Okay.

221
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,729
His legs were too extended.

222
00:09:39,389 --> 00:09:41,360
Indian people are all kind.

223
00:09:42,029 --> 00:09:43,570
It's interesting. There are no rules,

224
00:09:43,570 --> 00:09:46,130
- but people are following rules here.
- You're right.

225
00:09:46,729 --> 00:09:49,070
That's all for today.

226
00:09:50,409 --> 00:09:53,070
(Coughing)

227
00:09:53,070 --> 00:09:54,310
Gosh. My condition isn't great.

228
00:09:56,039 --> 00:10:00,149
I'm going to eat a nice dinner here.

229
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:01,479
(Dex is about to enjoy a nice meal alone.)

230
00:10:01,479 --> 00:10:03,079
Then I'll fall asleep in a good mood.

231
00:10:03,550 --> 00:10:06,219
Okay. My dinner is ready.

232
00:10:06,219 --> 00:10:07,619
But it's not ready.

233
00:10:07,619 --> 00:10:08,820
It's basically...

234
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:11,530
- Because it was dark, I couldn't see.
- Oh, you couldn't see.

235
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,800
I think I forgot to do something
that I was supposed to do.

236
00:10:13,999 --> 00:10:15,800
I made rice,

237
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:17,599
but it didn't cook well.

238
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,369
(He still takes a bite with confidence.)

239
00:10:21,170 --> 00:10:23,300
- Oh, my. The sound.
- It didn't cook.

240
00:10:24,009 --> 00:10:26,109
(Laughing)

241
00:10:26,109 --> 00:10:28,009
It's like a snack, but it tastes good.

242
00:10:29,239 --> 00:10:31,310
Because I was so hungry,

243
00:10:31,509 --> 00:10:33,719
I thought of it as eating nurungji.

244
00:10:33,719 --> 00:10:34,879
Yes. Here...

245
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:37,920
The rice isn't cooked at all,
but it's still very good.

246
00:10:38,450 --> 00:10:40,359
(Salivating)

247
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:42,160
Oh, your dinner?

248
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,359
- He has to eat too.
- Is it your dinnertime?

249
00:10:44,629 --> 00:10:46,560
- Dinner?
- Do you want to try it?

250
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,930
What is it?

251
00:10:48,329 --> 00:10:49,599
- Potato?
- Potato.

252
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,430
- Do you want to try one?
- Trade?

253
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,930
Oh, okay. I'll try one.

254
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,099
Thank you.

255
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:55,969
Oh, potato.

256
00:10:55,969 --> 00:10:57,109
(Wrapping potato in chapati, Indian bread)

257
00:10:58,070 --> 00:11:00,839
(Eating it all in one bite)

258
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:02,579
(Satisfied)

259
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:05,379
- Oh, good.
- Good enough?

260
00:11:05,379 --> 00:11:07,579
- Thank you. It was like potato wedges.
- I see.

261
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:08,650
It was like potato wedges,

262
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,749
- but with a lot of spices.
- I see.

263
00:11:11,119 --> 00:11:12,950
Thank you. You're a very kind man.

264
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:15,420
What's your job?

265
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:18,160
- I'm a software developer.
- Oh, software?

266
00:11:19,160 --> 00:11:22,629
- Oh, software?
- That means he's an elite in India.

267
00:11:22,629 --> 00:11:24,570
- It really is an IT powerhouse.
- Right.

268
00:11:24,969 --> 00:11:27,739
Many Indian engineers
work for Korean companies,

269
00:11:27,739 --> 00:11:28,999
like Samsung or LG.

270
00:11:28,999 --> 00:11:31,270
Oh, really? Samsung or LG?

271
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:34,239
India and South Korea
have a good friendship.

272
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:37,150
We are good.

273
00:11:37,479 --> 00:11:38,780
You really are a civilian diplomat.

274
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,680
- Really?
- Do you know Kelly?

275
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:41,849
- Kelly?
- Yes.

276
00:11:41,849 --> 00:11:43,050
What is Kelly?

277
00:11:43,050 --> 00:11:45,089
- You don't know Kelly?
- I don't know.

278
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:49,219
Dex is a lot chattier...

279
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:51,930
than I thought.

280
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:55,560
They were talking so much
that I couldn't fall asleep.

281
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:57,400
- I couldn't fall asleep.
- Sorry.

282
00:11:57,900 --> 00:12:00,129
I didn't want to lose,
so I turned mine on too.

283
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:02,270
Where are you going?

284
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,910
(Dex Admirer)

285
00:12:07,479 --> 00:12:09,410
(Well...)

286
00:12:09,410 --> 00:12:10,579
I don't have anything to say.

287
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:13,479
If I have something to say...

288
00:12:13,479 --> 00:12:14,820
What's your name?

289
00:12:14,820 --> 00:12:16,379
(Goodnight)

290
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,690
This exception exists everywhere.

291
00:12:19,690 --> 00:12:20,790
Oh, really?

292
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:22,959
- You believe in a higher power?
- Yes.

293
00:12:23,259 --> 00:12:24,790
I believe...

294
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:27,660
(The night train is both
similar and different for Kian84 and Dex.)

295
00:12:28,499 --> 00:12:30,599
- Oh, they turn off the lights.
- Oh, really?

296
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,739
(The lights suddenly turn on?)

297
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:41,479
The lights in the cabin
suddenly turned on.

298
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:44,979
People looking like
secret royal inspectors came bursting in.

299
00:12:44,979 --> 00:12:48,619
They're checking everyone's tickets.

300
00:12:48,619 --> 00:12:50,820
- Oh, they're checking.
- Checking tickets?

301
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:52,619
They should check before we sleep.

302
00:12:52,619 --> 00:12:53,790
- Seriously.
- Why did they wake us up?

303
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:54,989
- They wake you up?
- Yes.

304
00:12:55,259 --> 00:12:57,430
They suddenly come in late at night.

305
00:12:57,430 --> 00:12:59,089
- That's strange.
- They were checking.

306
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:02,930
Okay. Let's go.

307
00:13:03,829 --> 00:13:07,800
(On their way to meet the last brother!)

308
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
(Departed at 4 p.m.,
Estimated arrival at 7 a.m.)

309
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:09,800
(Traveling for 12 hours)

310
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,170
(Traveling for 15 hours)

311
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,469
It was delayed by quite a lot.

312
00:13:13,469 --> 00:13:14,640
It wasn't just one or two hours.

313
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,780
- It was late by three hours.
- Oh, my.

314
00:13:16,780 --> 00:13:17,849
(Arriving approximately 3 hours late)

315
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:21,050
Because it kept getting delayed,

316
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:22,719
- it was already morning.
- Right.

317
00:13:22,719 --> 00:13:24,320
(The train is still running
even after sunrise.)

318
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:29,719
(Unaware, the two brothers
are still sleeping.)

319
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:31,530
Gosh. I feel like I'm going to die.

320
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,499
I think my body is going to break.

321
00:13:36,629 --> 00:13:39,170
I was cold, so I put this on my feet.

322
00:13:39,170 --> 00:13:40,229
It was so cold,

323
00:13:40,229 --> 00:13:42,270
- so I put that on my feet.
- I see.

324
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:44,209
I changed into pants as well.

325
00:13:44,209 --> 00:13:45,509
- I see.
- Because I was cold.

326
00:13:45,940 --> 00:13:47,739
- Even in India...
- The air was so cold before dawn.

327
00:13:47,739 --> 00:13:49,509
- That's why...
- Oh, right. The window is open.

328
00:13:49,509 --> 00:13:51,009
Yes. The window was open.

329
00:13:51,009 --> 00:13:53,849
We were shaking in the cold
until the morning.

330
00:13:53,849 --> 00:13:54,950
- Gosh.
- Oh, my.

331
00:13:55,219 --> 00:13:59,119
If anyone wants to ride the train
from Varanasi,

332
00:13:59,550 --> 00:14:00,890
please ride...

333
00:14:01,489 --> 00:14:02,859
in S-class.

334
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,329
(His past choices now feel careless.)

335
00:14:05,329 --> 00:14:07,229
Kian84 finally said so himself.

336
00:14:07,229 --> 00:14:09,129
- Right.
- Indian trains are popular,

337
00:14:09,129 --> 00:14:10,499
so you need to make reservations
ahead of time.

338
00:14:10,499 --> 00:14:12,099
- Reserve a couple of months ahead.
- Yes.

339
00:14:13,129 --> 00:14:15,499
(Unlike Kian84,
who is tossing and turning,)

340
00:14:16,469 --> 00:14:19,369
(Dex isn't getting up.)

341
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:21,780
(Oh, my...)

342
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:22,979
I feel like I'm going to vomit.

343
00:14:23,609 --> 00:14:24,680
- Gosh.
- Oh, no.

344
00:14:25,509 --> 00:14:27,320
(Please hold this for me.)

345
00:14:27,379 --> 00:14:28,379
You don't seem well.

346
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:31,119
- We were both so tired then.
- Right.

347
00:14:32,619 --> 00:14:35,890
(Dex heads to the restroom
without a word.)

348
00:14:37,359 --> 00:14:38,390
(Meanwhile, they arrive
at New Delhi Station!)

349
00:14:38,390 --> 00:14:40,030
- Oh, you're here.
- That must've been tough.

350
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:41,999
- We finally arrived.
- You need to meet Pani Bottle.

351
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:44,969
(They all get ready to get off.)

352
00:14:45,329 --> 00:14:46,430
(Bye.)

353
00:14:46,430 --> 00:14:47,499
Bye.

354
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:49,900
- I said bye to the little kid.
- Right.

355
00:14:51,209 --> 00:14:52,640
(And...)

356
00:14:52,640 --> 00:14:54,680
- Oh, no.
- I'm worried.

357
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,839
(is he a statue?)

358
00:14:57,180 --> 00:15:00,180
(He's so tired
that he can't move from his seat.)

359
00:15:00,780 --> 00:15:04,020
(No. We need to go meet Pani Bottle.)

360
00:15:04,749 --> 00:15:07,619
- His legs have no strength.
- Right. No strength at all.

361
00:15:11,589 --> 00:15:12,690
(Both of their faces
became gaunt overnight.)

362
00:15:12,690 --> 00:15:13,759
Where do we have to go?

363
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:16,329
Oh, right.

364
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:18,430
Did he wait three more hours?

365
00:15:19,300 --> 00:15:20,300
This is crazy.

366
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,040
Because it was delayed,
he had to wait for a long time.

367
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,099
You're right.

368
00:15:23,170 --> 00:15:25,509
Gosh, I feel bad.
He must've waited for three hours.

369
00:15:25,509 --> 00:15:26,540
Right.

370
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:29,140
Oh, no.

371
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:31,150
- Did you not sleep?
- What?

372
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:32,609
- Did you not sleep?
- I didn't.

373
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:34,780
- Maybe one hour.
- One hour?

374
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,719
I don't think it was more than an hour.

375
00:15:37,550 --> 00:15:40,890
(They really need their Pani Bottle.)

376
00:15:41,420 --> 00:15:42,790
Wait. I think it's here...

377
00:15:43,719 --> 00:15:45,060
He said to meet in front of a statue.

378
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,060
(They were to meet
in front of a train statue.)

379
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:50,700
(Pani Bottle gave them instructions
during their last call.)

380
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,129
(In front of the train statue
at New Delhi Station)

381
00:15:54,070 --> 00:15:56,170
(Maybe since they didn't have Pani Bottle,
who's visiting India for the 3rd time,)

382
00:15:56,670 --> 00:16:00,339
(their brains did not work well
during the past few days.)

383
00:16:01,609 --> 00:16:06,310
(They gave out money here and there...)

384
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:11,890
(and even became the ATM of peace.)

385
00:16:12,619 --> 00:16:14,489
- They need Pani Bottle right now.
- Yes.

386
00:16:14,489 --> 00:16:15,560
He was the savior.

387
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:16,589
(They were desperate to have Pani Bottle.)

388
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,790
(Pani bottle)

389
00:16:17,930 --> 00:16:21,160
(The name was called out on the train.)

390
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:25,599
(They are on the way
to meet their savior.)

391
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,140
Oh, the clock tower outside.

392
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:30,369
They must be so happy to see him.

393
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:32,170
- There it is.
- Where?

394
00:16:32,170 --> 00:16:33,570
- Over there.
- Do you see it?

395
00:16:34,709 --> 00:16:38,249
(The train statue)

396
00:16:38,249 --> 00:16:40,609
(And underneath it...)

397
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:43,550
(Savior Pani Bottle is here.)

398
00:16:43,550 --> 00:16:45,020
- Pani Bottle.
- We finally met.

399
00:16:45,020 --> 00:16:46,489
He's the savior.

400
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,989
- There.
- Hey!

401
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:50,560
They must be so happy to see him.

402
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:52,629
Kian84.

403
00:16:52,629 --> 00:16:54,499
(Actually, this man with a kind smile...)

404
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:56,530
(Due to the train running late...)

405
00:16:56,530 --> 00:16:57,700
When is it coming?

406
00:16:58,229 --> 00:16:59,499
How late will it arrive?

407
00:16:59,869 --> 00:17:01,739
He waited for three hours.

408
00:17:01,869 --> 00:17:03,800
He waited for three hours?

409
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,869
He didn't even show it,
and he greeted us with a big smile.

410
00:17:05,869 --> 00:17:06,869
(The Indian water bottle doesn't show
that he had been waiting.)

411
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:09,209
(Kind)

412
00:17:10,339 --> 00:17:11,579
Pani Bottle.

413
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:14,180
I love you.

414
00:17:14,180 --> 00:17:16,020
- It's nice when you meet others abroad.
- Yes.

415
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,619
- It's like reuniting with family.
- That's right.

416
00:17:17,849 --> 00:17:19,150
Goodness.

417
00:17:19,150 --> 00:17:20,249
Are you okay?

418
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,089
- It's so tough.
- Are you okay?

419
00:17:24,089 --> 00:17:25,660
(Dazed)

420
00:17:26,390 --> 00:17:27,660
Are you okay?

421
00:17:27,660 --> 00:17:28,660
(The youngest one drops his head.)

422
00:17:28,660 --> 00:17:29,959
What is this bag?

423
00:17:30,229 --> 00:17:31,369
What did you bring?

424
00:17:31,430 --> 00:17:33,629
I prepared a lot, but...

425
00:17:33,629 --> 00:17:35,700
- And what is this headset?
- I...

426
00:17:35,999 --> 00:17:38,540
- This is seriously killing me.
- Did you get any sleep?

427
00:17:38,540 --> 00:17:40,609
Dex only got an hour of sleep.

428
00:17:40,609 --> 00:17:42,280
(Tired)

429
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,550
Pani Bottle must have been tired
from waiting for us,

430
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,280
but we looked so bad.
I feel sorry about that.

431
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:48,780
Now that I'm seeing this...

432
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,420
We were happy to see him on the inside.

433
00:17:51,349 --> 00:17:53,650
- The train was three hours late, right?
- Yes.

434
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:54,660
(The three brothers finally met.)

435
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:55,660
(Glancing)

436
00:17:55,790 --> 00:17:57,320
We should go, then.

437
00:17:58,060 --> 00:18:00,060
- I got us a room.
- Okay.

438
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:02,129
- Let's go.
- Okay.

439
00:18:03,329 --> 00:18:06,099
It's a ten-minute walk,
but you have a lot of luggage.

440
00:18:07,229 --> 00:18:08,670
- Hello.
- Yes?

441
00:18:08,670 --> 00:18:11,509
- All Is Well.
- All Is Well?

442
00:18:11,509 --> 00:18:14,310
All Is Well in Paharganj.

443
00:18:14,310 --> 00:18:16,310
- It's 200 rupees.
- It's 200?

444
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:19,150
(It's a bit expensive.)

445
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:22,849
(Tired to the max)

446
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,489
(Thinking)

447
00:18:26,349 --> 00:18:28,920
This is actually expensive,
but let's just go since we're tired.

448
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,089
- Yes.
- Two hundred?

449
00:18:30,089 --> 00:18:31,930
- Okay.
- How reassuring.

450
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:34,459
- He is Charismatic Pani.
- Charismatic Pani.

451
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:35,759
He's great.

452
00:18:36,059 --> 00:18:37,059
(He leads the way with charisma.)

453
00:18:37,059 --> 00:18:38,469
- Behind.
- Can three people get on?

454
00:18:38,469 --> 00:18:39,969
- Get on.
- Will we fit?

455
00:18:39,969 --> 00:18:41,170
It's enough.

456
00:18:41,170 --> 00:18:42,299
Let's get on first.

457
00:18:42,299 --> 00:18:43,799
(He lets the tired brothers get on first.)

458
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,670
- Is it okay here?
- Okay, no problem.

459
00:18:46,410 --> 00:18:47,910
We will be there in no time.

460
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:50,979
(They successfully get on the rickshaw.)

461
00:18:54,819 --> 00:18:56,650
- Goodness.
- Why is one side out?

462
00:18:57,989 --> 00:18:59,719
- Are you okay?
- Bottom Bottle.

463
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:00,860
(Setting off
with Charismatic Bottom Bottle)

464
00:19:02,959 --> 00:19:04,360
What time did you get here?

465
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:07,600
About 4 p.m. or 5 p.m. yesterday.

466
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,059
- I got to sleep.
- In the afternoon?

467
00:19:09,059 --> 00:19:11,229
- At the hotel?
- Yes. I was here early.

468
00:19:11,799 --> 00:19:12,830
(Beep)

469
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:14,799
(Beep)

470
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:17,539
This honking...

471
00:19:17,969 --> 00:19:19,569
It's making me neurotic.

472
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,340
- This is just daily life.
- Yes.

473
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:24,279
(The loud honking from all directions
is also common in New Delhi.)

474
00:19:24,279 --> 00:19:25,410
It's okay.

475
00:19:25,650 --> 00:19:28,450
Didn't you want to have a hard time?

476
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,080
(Coughing)

477
00:19:30,080 --> 00:19:32,989
- The experience is important,
- Yes.

478
00:19:33,590 --> 00:19:35,390
and I think I've had enough.

479
00:19:35,390 --> 00:19:37,590
- It's enough since you experienced it?
- Yes.

480
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:38,890
- Once is enough?
- Yes.

481
00:19:39,459 --> 00:19:41,900
The place where people get
on top of the train...

482
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:44,569
is Bangladesh, not India.

483
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:46,269
- It's Bangladesh?
- Yes, people don't do that here.

484
00:19:46,269 --> 00:19:48,469
- Maybe somewhere, but...
- Okay.

485
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,170
Personally, I don't think
I need to get up there anymore.

486
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:54,180
(Embarrassed)

487
00:19:54,709 --> 00:19:55,840
Challenges are...

488
00:19:55,840 --> 00:19:57,009
(Shaking)

489
00:19:57,749 --> 00:19:59,610
The important thing is to give up.

490
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:01,680
- Yes, you need to give up.
- He gave up.

491
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,950
We don't have any plans anymore.

492
00:20:04,950 --> 00:20:07,450
- What should we...
- Should we talk about it at the hotel?

493
00:20:07,450 --> 00:20:08,519
Sure.

494
00:20:08,789 --> 00:20:10,190
Okay, let's go.

495
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,860
What happened? It's empty now.

496
00:20:14,630 --> 00:20:16,959
- Gosh, look at that.
- The capital city of India.

497
00:20:16,959 --> 00:20:18,430
- The capital city.
- Finally.

498
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:19,700
(The capital city, New Delhi,
with 1.4 billion people)

499
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:21,799
- That looks great.
- That's good.

500
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:23,600
- Isn't that Paris?
- That looks like the Arc de Triomphe.

501
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:24,969
(A planned city with a long history)

502
00:20:24,969 --> 00:20:26,739
It feels totally different.

503
00:20:26,739 --> 00:20:29,610
It's the complete opposite of Varanasi.

504
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:32,580
(The place where India's modernity...)

505
00:20:32,580 --> 00:20:34,580
(and future coexist)

506
00:20:39,350 --> 00:20:41,890
(Arrived at the hotel)

507
00:20:41,890 --> 00:20:44,489
We had no plans after this.

508
00:20:44,559 --> 00:20:48,100
But we had Pani Bottle,
so we expected things to go well.

509
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,400
Hello.

510
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,100
They are my friends.

511
00:20:53,430 --> 00:20:55,739
Please put two more people in my room.

512
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:57,239
Because my room is a triple room.

513
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,670
- Yes.
- Yes.

514
00:20:58,670 --> 00:20:59,940
- Your passport.
- My passport?

515
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:01,580
- Yes, your passport.
- Okay.

516
00:21:01,739 --> 00:21:04,039
He's like a local guide.

517
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,279
He's so trustworthy.

518
00:21:06,479 --> 00:21:08,080
(Groaning)

519
00:21:09,249 --> 00:21:11,489
- Are you okay? You look so tired.
- It's okay.

520
00:21:14,219 --> 00:21:15,390
I feel bad.

521
00:21:15,719 --> 00:21:18,729
It's because of the food, right?

522
00:21:18,729 --> 00:21:20,390
I don't feel good, either.

523
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,759
- What did we eat yesterday?
- Where is the toilet?

524
00:21:23,259 --> 00:21:25,569
The toilet is in the room.

525
00:21:26,430 --> 00:21:28,769
- We need to sign in first.
- Sign?

526
00:21:28,969 --> 00:21:30,940
(They check in manually.)

527
00:21:31,539 --> 00:21:33,039
It's 2014, yes.

528
00:21:33,239 --> 00:21:36,209
We should have been more happy to see you,

529
00:21:36,209 --> 00:21:38,110
- but we were too tired.
- It's okay.

530
00:21:39,180 --> 00:21:40,580
I understand.

531
00:21:41,650 --> 00:21:43,719
(He also checks in manually.)

532
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,219
(Glancing)

533
00:21:47,719 --> 00:21:49,789
(Slowly walking away)

534
00:21:49,789 --> 00:21:51,690
- Your passport, please.
- Passport?

535
00:21:51,690 --> 00:21:52,729
(Grab)

536
00:21:52,729 --> 00:21:55,200
- Gosh, what is this?
- Again?

537
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,860
(What is this?)

538
00:21:57,299 --> 00:21:58,769
How did you...

539
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:01,069
- What's inside?
- He says it's 35kg.

540
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:03,039
- It's 35kg?
- It's 25kg.

541
00:22:03,539 --> 00:22:05,069
This is practically military gear.

542
00:22:05,069 --> 00:22:06,440
How did you... Let me try.

543
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,380
I think he did that to work out his legs.

544
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,539
(Heaving)

545
00:22:09,539 --> 00:22:11,450
He did that to get exercise.

546
00:22:11,450 --> 00:22:14,180
No wonder you're tired
from carrying this bag around.

547
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,890
Since we didn't look so good,

548
00:22:17,890 --> 00:22:19,319
he kept making jokes.

549
00:22:19,319 --> 00:22:20,819
- Is he carrying it for you?
- Yes.

550
00:22:20,819 --> 00:22:22,890
Gosh, he's so sweet.

551
00:22:22,959 --> 00:22:24,019
Good stories about Pani Bottle.

552
00:22:24,219 --> 00:22:26,330
Hey, I carried it too when you came.

553
00:22:27,330 --> 00:22:29,959
(We have good stories about Kian84 too.)

554
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:32,170
(Thank you, Kian84.)

555
00:22:33,130 --> 00:22:34,569
- Okay, finished.
- Okay.

556
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:35,640
Thank you.

557
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:39,340
Hotel.

558
00:22:40,739 --> 00:22:41,779
This way.

559
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,680
- I left the air conditioning on.
- Okay.

560
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:48,380
(Going in)

561
00:22:49,219 --> 00:22:51,989
(The place where
they will recover their strength)

562
00:22:52,150 --> 00:22:53,920
- I just pulled the covers off...
- Put it down.

563
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:56,860
to check if there were any bedbugs.

564
00:22:56,860 --> 00:22:57,959
I didn't sleep on this.

565
00:22:58,059 --> 00:23:00,229
(He puts down the bag.)

566
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,299
(Tired)

567
00:23:02,299 --> 00:23:03,459
Gosh, my neck.

568
00:23:03,830 --> 00:23:06,100
I'm already tired after carrying the bag
for that short time.

569
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,299
Oh, right.

570
00:23:10,370 --> 00:23:11,840
- I brought something.
- What?

571
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:13,069
- What?
- What?

572
00:23:13,569 --> 00:23:15,610
- Have you tried lassi?
- Lassi?

573
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:18,080
Lassi? You need to try that in India.

574
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:21,150
He prepared drinks for us,
since it's hot on the train.

575
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:23,979
- Aren't you thirsty?
- I'll have water.

576
00:23:23,979 --> 00:23:25,620
- I don't think I can have anything else.
- Water is over there.

577
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:27,090
(Dex has water instead of lassi.)

578
00:23:27,090 --> 00:23:28,390
Lassi.

579
00:23:29,590 --> 00:23:30,719
Sanitizer.

580
00:23:30,719 --> 00:23:32,590
(He takes care of their hygiene as well.)

581
00:23:33,789 --> 00:23:34,799
Sanitizer.

582
00:23:35,499 --> 00:23:37,559
- This?
- No.

583
00:23:37,930 --> 00:23:39,299
- I thought it was for the water.
- He's lost.

584
00:23:39,299 --> 00:23:41,539
- Were you that tired?
- I was completely...

585
00:23:41,539 --> 00:23:43,170
out of my mind.

586
00:23:43,170 --> 00:23:45,069
He's out of his mind.

587
00:23:45,069 --> 00:23:46,640
Here.

588
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:48,209
Why would you put that in the water?

589
00:23:48,539 --> 00:23:49,580
He wanted to drink that.

590
00:23:49,580 --> 00:23:50,840
(He almost sanitized his stomach.)

591
00:23:51,249 --> 00:23:52,580
What do we have to do today?

592
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,650
- Today?
- Yes.

593
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:57,450
I already did a lot of things
I wanted to do in Varanasi,

594
00:23:57,549 --> 00:23:58,850
so you two can do what you want.

595
00:23:58,989 --> 00:24:00,319
(Laughing)

596
00:24:00,519 --> 00:24:02,690
Didn't you have a lot on your list?

597
00:24:03,660 --> 00:24:05,289
- No, I really did a lot.
- You said...

598
00:24:05,289 --> 00:24:08,700
you wanted to meet a rich person.

599
00:24:09,759 --> 00:24:11,569
(Something else on Kian84's bucket list)

600
00:24:11,569 --> 00:24:13,100
I heard the rich there
are on another level.

601
00:24:13,870 --> 00:24:16,269
So I was just curious.

602
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,170
(He was curious about the life...)

603
00:24:19,170 --> 00:24:22,140
(he had never seen before.)

604
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,279
You want to experience it?

605
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:26,180
In Varanasi,

606
00:24:26,249 --> 00:24:27,779
I saw a lot of different people,

607
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:29,380
but in New Delhi,

608
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:32,519
I wanted to meet people who were
the leaders of India's future.

609
00:24:32,519 --> 00:24:33,690
That's a nice course.

610
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:36,390
You saw the past and present in Varanasi,

611
00:24:36,390 --> 00:24:39,029
- and in New Delhi...
- Yes, Varanasi is India's past,

612
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:41,200
- so I wanted to see India's future here.
- Yes.

613
00:24:41,499 --> 00:24:44,499
I hear that there are
a lot of Indian CEOs...

614
00:24:44,499 --> 00:24:46,029
among the many top companies
around the world.

615
00:24:46,029 --> 00:24:47,100
That's right.

616
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,870
- There are many Indian leaders...
- Yes.

617
00:24:49,870 --> 00:24:51,910
- in top IT companies.
- Yes.

618
00:24:52,309 --> 00:24:54,209
- Are you going to meet those people?
- Yes.

619
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:56,979
I looked it up,

620
00:24:56,979 --> 00:24:58,080
and it wasn't easy.

621
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,549
- In conclusion, I couldn't find any,
- Okay.

622
00:25:00,749 --> 00:25:02,080
but the staff did.

623
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,620
There is a really big company here.

624
00:25:04,749 --> 00:25:06,319
- Modi Group.
- "Modi?"

625
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,620
- I've heard of it.
- Yes.

626
00:25:08,019 --> 00:25:09,190
(Have you really?)

627
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:10,890
(He doesn't know.)

628
00:25:11,059 --> 00:25:13,890
They got in contact with the chairman.

629
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:15,700
Why would the chairman
of a big company meet us?

630
00:25:15,900 --> 00:25:18,729
- He is interested in Korean content.
- Gosh.

631
00:25:18,729 --> 00:25:21,469
- Really?
- So they were...

632
00:25:21,469 --> 00:25:22,940
very positive about it.

633
00:25:22,940 --> 00:25:24,140
Really?

634
00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,569
- So we can...
- Amazing.

635
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:26,840
Are they inviting us?

636
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:28,080
- Yes.
- Amazing.

637
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,340
If we're going to a rich man's house,

638
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:31,950
I'm happy.

639
00:25:32,209 --> 00:25:33,979
Gosh, an Indian rich man.

640
00:25:33,979 --> 00:25:34,979
(He is excited about meeting a rich man.)

641
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,749
- So...
- Does the rich man want us to come today?

642
00:25:38,249 --> 00:25:39,819
- It's supposed to be today, but...
- Are we...

643
00:25:39,819 --> 00:25:40,890
- Really?
- Yes.

644
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:42,090
(Looking over)

645
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:43,590
- Are you feeling sick anywhere?
- Me?

646
00:25:43,860 --> 00:25:46,759
I'm not sure. I do feel queasy.

647
00:25:46,759 --> 00:25:47,900
No matter what you eat?

648
00:25:47,900 --> 00:25:49,600
I feel sick inside.

649
00:25:49,799 --> 00:25:51,430
- Should we take a rest?
- Yes, you look tired.

650
00:25:51,430 --> 00:25:53,370
- Yes, let's take a rest first.
- We were supposed to...

651
00:25:53,370 --> 00:25:55,700
have lunch with him.

652
00:25:55,700 --> 00:25:57,269
This was about 8 a.m.

653
00:25:57,269 --> 00:25:59,209
- So we had some time.
- Let's rest.

654
00:25:59,209 --> 00:26:00,670
Yes, you need to recharge.

655
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:02,380
Okay.

656
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:03,910
Let's rest first.

657
00:26:04,180 --> 00:26:05,249
Let's smile.

658
00:26:05,850 --> 00:26:08,650
We looked too grim when we met you.

659
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:10,779
I didn't see this face last time
in South America.

660
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,350
We look too grim.

661
00:26:13,190 --> 00:26:15,090
You need to take a rest.

662
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,719
This isn't even the last day.

663
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:25,200
(The older ones adjust themselves
for their next plans.)

664
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,870
(Meanwhile)

665
00:26:27,870 --> 00:26:29,499
Something is wrong.

666
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:32,739
(The younger one doesn't look too good.)

667
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,979
My stomach felt like
it was being ripped apart.

668
00:26:35,979 --> 00:26:39,049
It felt like my insides
were being ripped apart,

669
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:41,620
and I had pain in my stomach.

670
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:42,719
Oh, no.

671
00:26:42,719 --> 00:26:45,420
After getting off the train
and arriving at the hotel,

672
00:26:45,420 --> 00:26:46,819
I started to feel the pain...

673
00:26:46,819 --> 00:26:49,660
once I felt less tense.

674
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,700
(After eating a lot of things
on the train...)

675
00:26:56,459 --> 00:26:59,130
It was so cold inside the train at night,

676
00:26:59,130 --> 00:27:00,799
since the wind kept coming in
through the window.

677
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,539
I wasn't able to sleep at all.

678
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:04,809
Oh, no.

679
00:27:05,309 --> 00:27:06,670
(I think I'm going to vomit.)

680
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,809
(Moaning)

681
00:27:08,809 --> 00:27:10,509
- Did you have an upset stomach?
- Yes.

682
00:27:10,509 --> 00:27:11,850
I think something was wrong with the food.

683
00:27:11,850 --> 00:27:13,309
It wasn't only because of the food.

684
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:15,080
It wasn't just one thing that caused it.

685
00:27:15,080 --> 00:27:16,950
- Everything piled up to this point.
- Yes.

686
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:19,850
I have my pride,

687
00:27:19,850 --> 00:27:21,150
so I didn't want to say it.

688
00:27:21,150 --> 00:27:24,390
That was why I didn't tell them in detail,

689
00:27:24,390 --> 00:27:25,860
so they wouldn't have known back then.

690
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:28,799
I didn't know he was that sick.

691
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:31,100
I just thought he had a slight cold.

692
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:36,239
(Staggering)

693
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:39,640
(Throwing up)

694
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,940
Gosh, he's throwing up again.

695
00:27:41,269 --> 00:27:42,610
Did you throw up again
after drinking cola?

696
00:27:43,410 --> 00:27:44,809
You look even worse.

697
00:27:44,809 --> 00:27:46,209
I'm so worried.

698
00:27:46,209 --> 00:27:47,779
- It's okay.
- You don't look good.

699
00:27:47,779 --> 00:27:50,319
We should take you to a hospital.

700
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,549
You need to feel better first.

701
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:54,789
We think that's the right thing to do.

702
00:27:56,890 --> 00:27:59,259
We were there on a trip together.

703
00:27:59,489 --> 00:28:00,729
We were supposed to be enjoying ourselves,

704
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,229
but we couldn't.

705
00:28:03,529 --> 00:28:04,870
So I felt so sorry for Pani Bottle.

706
00:28:04,870 --> 00:28:07,799
The train was late,
so he had to wait for us for hours,

707
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,499
but he still took care of me so much.

708
00:28:10,769 --> 00:28:12,569
Starting with the bed too.

709
00:28:12,569 --> 00:28:15,239
He let me use the single bed alone...

710
00:28:15,239 --> 00:28:17,009
and told me to take it easy and rest.

711
00:28:17,009 --> 00:28:18,009
(He was considerate of the younger one.)

712
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:20,380
Kian84 wasn't feeling well either.

713
00:28:20,380 --> 00:28:22,920
He had a cold as well,

714
00:28:22,920 --> 00:28:24,450
but he was worried about me...

715
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:26,890
and showed concern.

716
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:28,459
I'm very thankful for that.

717
00:28:28,459 --> 00:28:30,519
(He felt thankful and sorry
towards the other two guys.)

718
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:33,660
(He leaves the concern behind...)

719
00:28:33,660 --> 00:28:36,700
(and heads to the hospital.)

720
00:28:38,529 --> 00:28:40,499
It's so hard when you're sick
while traveling abroad.

721
00:28:40,499 --> 00:28:41,870
- I know.
- It's that way.

722
00:28:42,569 --> 00:28:46,469
(He gets an emergency checkup
and a prescription.)

723
00:28:46,469 --> 00:28:47,670
Oh, no.

724
00:28:49,539 --> 00:28:51,610
(Dex is left alone.)

725
00:28:51,610 --> 00:28:52,650
Oh, no.

726
00:28:52,650 --> 00:28:54,779
(Will the trip end like this?)

727
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,519
I'm worried about Dex since he's sick.

728
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,920
- It will be better for him...
- Yes.

729
00:29:00,920 --> 00:29:01,959
to get some rest and take it easy.

730
00:29:01,959 --> 00:29:04,690
- But we had an appointment.
- Yes.

731
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:05,930
So if I didn't go as well,

732
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,590
- Yes.
- it wouldn't seem polite.

733
00:29:07,590 --> 00:29:08,759
- It was already planned.
- Yes.

734
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,830
We told him to rest...

735
00:29:09,830 --> 00:29:11,670
and that we will go to the appointment.

736
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:13,069
- Yes.
- That's what we did.

737
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:14,700
Did your stomach feel all right?

738
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:16,170
I was fine.

739
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:18,039
- Right? Your stomach...
- In fact,

740
00:29:18,239 --> 00:29:20,140
I often get sick
after eating in my own home.

741
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,779
- Really?
- Please just eat normal food.

742
00:29:23,779 --> 00:29:25,509
You eat food that's even worse.

743
00:29:25,509 --> 00:29:27,049
Right, it's because you eat like this.

744
00:29:27,049 --> 00:29:28,719
I prepared my stomach for this trip.

745
00:29:29,249 --> 00:29:30,749
Indian food is sanitary.

746
00:29:30,749 --> 00:29:32,049
(Indian food is more sanitary
than the food at my house.)

747
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:34,690
It turns out that...

748
00:29:34,959 --> 00:29:37,989
he has a weak stomach, and he's squeamish.

749
00:29:38,190 --> 00:29:39,190
(Beep)

750
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,330
Gosh.

751
00:29:40,330 --> 00:29:41,860
- It was amazing.
- That must be stressful.

752
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:43,259
- Gosh.
- That sound is...

753
00:29:44,499 --> 00:29:47,170
I'm used to it now.

754
00:29:47,170 --> 00:29:49,069
- I've been here often, right?
- Yes.

755
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:52,370
I thought I'd get used to it,
but it's not easy.

756
00:29:52,809 --> 00:29:54,340
Let's grab a taxi.

757
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:56,279
- Okay, let's go.
- Let's call a taxi.

758
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:58,749
They gave us the address,

759
00:29:58,749 --> 00:30:00,410
since we were invited.

760
00:30:00,410 --> 00:30:02,319
- Did you put sunscreen on?
- I did.

761
00:30:02,420 --> 00:30:03,420
(Peeking)

762
00:30:03,420 --> 00:30:04,719
Sorry, no.

763
00:30:04,989 --> 00:30:06,789
- Is he asking for money?
- Yes.

764
00:30:06,789 --> 00:30:07,920
I don't have money.

765
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:10,019
There were some kids like that.

766
00:30:11,059 --> 00:30:12,430
- You know...
- Yes?

767
00:30:12,430 --> 00:30:14,289
If you give them money once,

768
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:16,700
- they will all come over.
- Yes.

769
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:17,930
- There's no end to it.
- Yes.

770
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,999
- So it's better not to give them any.
- Yes.

771
00:30:21,430 --> 00:30:22,469
Goodness.

772
00:30:23,999 --> 00:30:25,569
(Difficult)

773
00:30:26,410 --> 00:30:27,809
- This?
- Yes, this is it.

774
00:30:27,809 --> 00:30:28,840
Hello?

775
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:29,940
(They get into a taxi on the street.)

776
00:30:29,940 --> 00:30:31,009
Hello.

777
00:30:31,910 --> 00:30:34,350
- This...
- What?

778
00:30:34,350 --> 00:30:36,019
- Even in the taxi?
- He came all the way?

779
00:30:36,019 --> 00:30:38,219
- Yes.
- Even in Varanasi...

780
00:30:39,350 --> 00:30:40,390
Sorry.

781
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,920
But I can't help them much.

782
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,959
You're right.

783
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,259
It's sad, but...

784
00:30:46,259 --> 00:30:47,259
Yes.

785
00:30:48,499 --> 00:30:50,459
I searched online,

786
00:30:50,459 --> 00:30:54,499
and this man is the head of Modi Group.

787
00:30:54,499 --> 00:30:57,840
- It's like Samsung or Daewoo of Korea.
- Gosh.

788
00:30:57,840 --> 00:30:59,309
- The chairman of Modi.
- Really?

789
00:30:59,309 --> 00:31:00,410
It's a conglomerate.

790
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:02,209
We can't meet the chairman of Samsung...

791
00:31:02,209 --> 00:31:04,080
- even if we want to.
- I know.

792
00:31:04,410 --> 00:31:06,279
I've never been to the house...

793
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:08,080
of a rich Indian person.

794
00:31:08,620 --> 00:31:10,180
I'm curious to see what it's like.

795
00:31:10,180 --> 00:31:11,479
I'm curious.

796
00:31:12,489 --> 00:31:13,850
- Wait, Do Yeon.
- Yes?

797
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:16,090
We need to know about this person first.

798
00:31:16,090 --> 00:31:17,890
- Yes, of course.
- That's right.

799
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:19,860
The person we will be meeting...

800
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:22,930
is the founder of
the Indian smart global group,

801
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,600
- Chairman Bhupendra Kumar Modi.
- What?

802
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,100
- Gosh.
- That's no joke.

803
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:31,039
In light of the changing times,
by providing plentiful resources...

804
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:33,539
and investments in order to develop
India's potential capabilities...

805
00:31:33,539 --> 00:31:34,569
- It's "support."
- Support.

806
00:31:34,569 --> 00:31:36,610
I'm reading the explanation...

807
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,650
- like I'm part of the company.
- I know.

808
00:31:39,979 --> 00:31:41,950
- The honorary employee.
- I noticed that...

809
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:44,350
he's very interested in Korean culture.

810
00:31:44,350 --> 00:31:46,989
- Yes.
- I think that's why he wanted to see us.

811
00:31:47,120 --> 00:31:48,890
And our show is on MBC.

812
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,989
- It's Korea's best TV station.
- Yes, that's right.

813
00:31:51,759 --> 00:31:53,559
How amazing are we?

814
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,660
(How amazing are we?)

815
00:31:56,660 --> 00:31:58,469
Are we almost there? How much longer?

816
00:31:59,529 --> 00:32:01,940
The city looks much tidier here.

817
00:32:02,739 --> 00:32:04,539
- It looks well-maintained.
- Yes.

818
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:07,640
- Once we got out of the city center,
- It seems different.

819
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:10,009
it looked like a developed country.

820
00:32:10,009 --> 00:32:11,539
- Yes.
- There's no more beeping.

821
00:32:11,539 --> 00:32:12,950
- Yes, that too.
- You're right.

822
00:32:12,950 --> 00:32:14,410
And it's quiet.

823
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:18,180
It's so different here.
It's like California.

824
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,019
It's so different.

825
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:23,660
- It's like a neat city here.
- Yes.

826
00:32:24,059 --> 00:32:25,559
It's like the US.

827
00:32:26,229 --> 00:32:28,630
Even all the buildings are meaningful.

828
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,729
They are all famous buildings.

829
00:32:31,769 --> 00:32:34,029
And there are houses.
These must be the rich people's houses.

830
00:32:35,940 --> 00:32:37,670
They must live together
so that other people can't enter.

831
00:32:37,670 --> 00:32:38,809
Are those residential buildings?

832
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:40,569
They have wired fences.

833
00:32:40,569 --> 00:32:42,509
Not everyone can enter.
They even have soldiers.

834
00:32:42,509 --> 00:32:43,940
(High security)

835
00:32:44,779 --> 00:32:47,479
Did you see anything like this
in Varanasi?

836
00:32:47,479 --> 00:32:48,920
Not at all.

837
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:50,249
It's so busy there.

838
00:32:50,249 --> 00:32:51,350
I was really shocked.

839
00:32:51,350 --> 00:32:52,549
(The streets in Varanasi
that shocked him...)

840
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:54,249
(Dogs,)

841
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:55,519
(cows,)

842
00:32:55,519 --> 00:32:56,860
(and even monkeys)

843
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,229
(Full of things you can ride)

844
00:32:59,759 --> 00:33:01,259
(There are no traffic lights!)

845
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,130
(The place had everything
except traffic lights.)

846
00:33:05,130 --> 00:33:06,799
It's completely different.

847
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,900
(The traffic lights in New Delhi
are in plain sight.)

848
00:33:08,229 --> 00:33:09,370
(What?)

849
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,539
- What is it?
- This must be it.

850
00:33:11,200 --> 00:33:13,370
(The front gate looks grand.)

851
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:15,140
- Why is the gate so big?
- They have guards.

852
00:33:15,140 --> 00:33:16,209
(There's even a guard!)

853
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:18,080
Do we get out?

854
00:33:18,479 --> 00:33:20,049
- Do we just stay in the car?
- Yes.

855
00:33:20,049 --> 00:33:23,450
They checked for identification
and let us in.

856
00:33:24,450 --> 00:33:26,049
We can enter in the taxi?

857
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:29,289
Gosh, look at this, Pani Bottle.

858
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:32,289
(The closed gate opens.)

859
00:33:32,289 --> 00:33:33,430
- Gosh.
- It's different.

860
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:34,759
It's even automatic.

861
00:33:35,259 --> 00:33:36,759
(Shocked)

862
00:33:36,759 --> 00:33:37,759
What is going on?

863
00:33:37,759 --> 00:33:38,769
(Wide eyes)

864
00:33:39,069 --> 00:33:40,269
(Stuttering)

865
00:33:41,499 --> 00:33:42,840
- It's so different.
- What is this?

866
00:33:44,340 --> 00:33:45,870
(The driveway with white tiles)

867
00:33:45,870 --> 00:33:47,569
- Gosh.
- That's amazing.

868
00:33:47,569 --> 00:33:48,779
It's that big?

869
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,610
It's a different world behind that wall.

870
00:33:51,610 --> 00:33:53,309
- With just that gate.
- It's amazing.

871
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,580
What is that?

872
00:33:54,580 --> 00:33:56,219
Is there a private badminton court?

873
00:33:56,620 --> 00:33:57,680
There's a pool.

874
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,489
- There's a pool too?
- Gosh.

875
00:34:00,819 --> 00:34:02,420
- That's amazing.
- In the middle of the city.

876
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,959
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

877
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,160
(Amazed)

878
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:10,729
(They get out of the taxi
feeling thrilled.)

879
00:34:10,729 --> 00:34:12,069
This is amazing.

880
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,029
Where do we go? Where are they?

881
00:34:14,029 --> 00:34:15,370
(The front yard looks
like a playing field.)

882
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:17,400
There's a Rolls-Royce.

883
00:34:17,670 --> 00:34:18,769
Is this a Rolls-Royce?

884
00:34:18,769 --> 00:34:21,239
Rolls-Royce.
It's my first time seeing this in India.

885
00:34:21,709 --> 00:34:24,509
This is a Rolls-Royce.

886
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,009
Try touching this.

887
00:34:26,009 --> 00:34:27,309
No, you shouldn't.

888
00:34:27,580 --> 00:34:29,380
This goes in if you touch it.

889
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:30,479
- Really?
- Hi.

890
00:34:30,719 --> 00:34:32,120
- Hello. Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

891
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,289
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

892
00:34:33,350 --> 00:34:35,360
(Someone approaches the two of them.)

893
00:34:36,090 --> 00:34:38,120
- She looked like a secretary...
- Yes.

894
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:40,330
- from a Marvel movie.
- A secretary.

895
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,390
Angel.

896
00:34:41,390 --> 00:34:42,660
- Sorry?
- Angel.

897
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,130
- Angel.
- Angel.

898
00:34:44,130 --> 00:34:46,299
- Like the messenger of the deities.
- Angel.

899
00:34:46,299 --> 00:34:47,430
- Angel?
- Hi. Angel.

900
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:48,940
- Yes. Nice to meet you.
- Yes, In Jun.

901
00:34:48,940 --> 00:34:50,299
Nice to meet you. My name is...

902
00:34:50,299 --> 00:34:51,440
- Who's In Jun?
- In Jun?

903
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,440
(Changing her name into
a shocking Korean name)

904
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,309
- In Jun? Who's In Jun?
- In Jun.

905
00:34:54,309 --> 00:34:55,539
- To me, Angel sounded like that.
- In Jun?

906
00:34:55,539 --> 00:34:57,110
She did pronounce it like In Jun.

907
00:34:57,110 --> 00:34:59,779
She was wearing a dress
that reminded me of fried eggs.

908
00:34:59,779 --> 00:35:01,819
- Fried eggs?
- Fried eggs.

909
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:02,950
I see. Her dress?

910
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:05,549
Nice to meet you. Lovely.
Welcome to the luxurious house.

911
00:35:05,549 --> 00:35:06,549
(In Jun seems familiar for some reason.)

912
00:35:06,549 --> 00:35:08,559
So Modi is your company, right?

913
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:10,519
It's my boss' company.

914
00:35:10,519 --> 00:35:12,259
I am the CEO.

915
00:35:12,289 --> 00:35:13,660
- Gosh. CEO.
- You're the CEO?

916
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:15,930
- He didn't bring his secretary.
- She wasn't his secretary.

917
00:35:15,930 --> 00:35:18,900
I am the CEO of one of his companies.

918
00:35:19,069 --> 00:35:20,400
He has many companies.

919
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:22,269
Like in Korea, conglomerates are
in different industries...

920
00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:23,340
- like semiconductors, department stores,
- Right.

921
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:25,569
- and distribution. There are a lot.
- Right. They are in many industries.

922
00:35:25,569 --> 00:35:28,340
- She's the CEO of one of his affiliates.
- She's the CEO.

923
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,779
- Gosh.
- She's impressive too.

924
00:35:29,779 --> 00:35:31,380
- Right.
- Right.

925
00:35:31,380 --> 00:35:33,380
- And the big boss is Modi, right?
- Yes.

926
00:35:33,380 --> 00:35:34,979
- Okay.
- Of course.

927
00:35:34,979 --> 00:35:36,450
Is Modi your father?

928
00:35:36,719 --> 00:35:38,450
- No.
- She just works for him.

929
00:35:38,450 --> 00:35:39,719
Really? She just works for him?

930
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:41,520
- She's the CEO. Yes.
- CEO?

931
00:35:41,819 --> 00:35:43,189
- We were both confused.
- Yes.

932
00:35:43,390 --> 00:35:45,129
So I'm from Mumbai.

933
00:35:45,790 --> 00:35:47,629
We came here. So I was with him for a day.

934
00:35:47,629 --> 00:35:49,830
- Okay.
- She stays in Mumbai.

935
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:51,259
But she came here just for us today.

936
00:35:51,259 --> 00:35:53,129
Goodness. Because of us?

937
00:35:53,129 --> 00:35:54,730
(Sounding like a countryman)

938
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:56,770
- Yes. Today, for you guys.
- For us.

939
00:35:56,770 --> 00:35:58,370
We can't disappoint him.

940
00:35:58,370 --> 00:35:59,770
- Thank you.
- Of course.

941
00:35:59,770 --> 00:36:01,370
- Anytime.
- Thank you.

942
00:36:01,509 --> 00:36:03,239
They made a long trip to be here.

943
00:36:03,239 --> 00:36:05,850
If we're no fun,
he might be disappointed in us.

944
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,620
- But we're not here to entertain him.
- Right. But...

945
00:36:08,750 --> 00:36:09,879
He felt the pressure.

946
00:36:09,980 --> 00:36:11,319
- Right.
- I got it.

947
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,919
"I came all the way from Mumbai.
But these guys are boring."

948
00:36:13,919 --> 00:36:15,560
I'm afraid that he might be disappointed.

949
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:18,460
So this is where he is.

950
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:20,189
His doors are confusing.

951
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:21,259
(Angel leads them and opens the door.)

952
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:22,299
Hello.

953
00:36:23,830 --> 00:36:25,129
(A spacious living room
in the shade of gold)

954
00:36:25,129 --> 00:36:27,029
Gosh, look at the interior design.
It's really cool.

955
00:36:28,069 --> 00:36:29,700
Is that all gold? What is it?

956
00:36:30,669 --> 00:36:32,239
Please have a seat.

957
00:36:32,640 --> 00:36:34,040
Which chair should I choose?

958
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,609
Right. Where should we sit?

959
00:36:35,609 --> 00:36:36,640
(There are dozens of chairs
like they're in a showroom.)

960
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,750
It feels like
we're going to have a summit meeting.

961
00:36:38,750 --> 00:36:40,310
- Right. Totally.
- Right.

962
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,520
So here is okay?

963
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:44,520
- Okay? Yes.
- Of course.

964
00:36:45,919 --> 00:36:48,120
(Angel goes to get the chairman.)

965
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:51,160
(Feeling intimidated)

966
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,560
By the way, I can't believe this.

967
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,430
- A few minutes ago,
- Yes.

968
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,100
- the kids were begging for money. But...
- Right.

969
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,270
It feels completely different.

970
00:36:59,270 --> 00:37:00,469
(They can't believe the gap.)

971
00:37:00,469 --> 00:37:01,529
Gosh.

972
00:37:02,669 --> 00:37:05,969
- Movie characters like James Bond...
- Yes.

973
00:37:06,169 --> 00:37:08,009
would come here
to assassinate their target.

974
00:37:08,640 --> 00:37:10,939
- You're right.
- It looked like a studio set...

975
00:37:10,939 --> 00:37:12,379
- we would see in movies.
- In the mirror...

976
00:37:12,850 --> 00:37:13,910
That's what this house looks like.

977
00:37:14,410 --> 00:37:16,879
I bet the sofa costs
at least hundreds of thousands of dollars.

978
00:37:18,419 --> 00:37:19,989
- This sofa...
- Is that real gold?

979
00:37:20,189 --> 00:37:21,549
(Tapping)

980
00:37:21,890 --> 00:37:24,319
(Checking the gold purity
with his fingertips)

981
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,660
- Even this looks very expensive.
- Right? It does look expensive.

982
00:37:28,489 --> 00:37:30,799
- Gosh. Look.
- They're fascinated by everything there.

983
00:37:30,799 --> 00:37:31,859
Everything looks expensive.

984
00:37:32,100 --> 00:37:34,700
Being here makes me humble.

985
00:37:34,700 --> 00:37:37,339
- I often spread my legs. But not here.
- Okay.

986
00:37:37,339 --> 00:37:39,210
I see. Keep them closed.

987
00:37:39,210 --> 00:37:40,469
- Keep them together.
- I did it unknowingly.

988
00:37:40,509 --> 00:37:42,180
That's a magnificent place.

989
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:44,710
- I'm not that fluent in English either.
- Yes.

990
00:37:44,879 --> 00:37:47,310
If there's anything you want to ask,
let me ask him for you.

991
00:37:47,310 --> 00:37:49,020
- I can speak a bit of English too.
- Well...

992
00:37:49,549 --> 00:37:51,379
I'll make sure not to offend him.

993
00:37:51,549 --> 00:37:54,120
(He can't trust Kian84.)

994
00:37:54,649 --> 00:37:55,819
(At that moment...)

995
00:37:55,819 --> 00:37:58,219
- Gosh. Namaste.
- Namaste.

996
00:37:58,890 --> 00:38:00,230
It's the chairman.

997
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,629
(He shows up, looking like the chairman.)

998
00:38:01,629 --> 00:38:03,259
- He looks cool.
- He's fashionable.

999
00:38:03,259 --> 00:38:05,160
(Polite)

1000
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,700
Is that the chairman of Modi?

1001
00:38:06,969 --> 00:38:08,430
He has a presence.

1002
00:38:08,430 --> 00:38:10,100
- It's obvious that he's the chairman.
- His vibe is crazy.

1003
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,739
- Right?
- This is amazing.

1004
00:38:11,799 --> 00:38:14,069
- I feel we're underdressed.
- Go ahead.

1005
00:38:14,069 --> 00:38:15,609
- Back there.
- We are underdressed, right?

1006
00:38:15,609 --> 00:38:16,939
- This isn't polite.
- This is...

1007
00:38:16,939 --> 00:38:18,509
Coming here...

1008
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:20,950
(He tried to be polite
by wearing his fancy floral shirt.)

1009
00:38:20,950 --> 00:38:22,649
Right. He took the shirt to dress up.

1010
00:38:22,649 --> 00:38:24,620
- Isn't this the same shirt?
- He's wearing that today.

1011
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:26,649
- You dressed up today, then.
- Yes.

1012
00:38:26,989 --> 00:38:30,560
We just talked about our clothes.

1013
00:38:30,560 --> 00:38:32,629
Our outfit looks rude.

1014
00:38:32,629 --> 00:38:34,529
But we're travelers. So that's why...

1015
00:38:34,529 --> 00:38:36,100
- No.
- we look like this.

1016
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,799
When I travel, I also dress like that.

1017
00:38:37,799 --> 00:38:39,100
- Okay.
- It's okay?

1018
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:40,370
- Gosh.
- Gosh. He has a kind face.

1019
00:38:40,370 --> 00:38:42,270
He also dresses like us when he travels.

1020
00:38:42,270 --> 00:38:44,200
- Really?
- Thank you for understanding.

1021
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,509
- Thank you.
- No. I understand.

1022
00:38:46,969 --> 00:38:48,509
What should we say?

1023
00:38:49,980 --> 00:38:52,779
I'm a Korean painter.

1024
00:38:54,149 --> 00:38:57,279
- Do you know webtoons? Comics?
- Comics.

1025
00:38:57,279 --> 00:38:58,419
- I see. You draw comics.
- Yes.

1026
00:38:58,419 --> 00:39:01,950
And I'm a Korean...

1027
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:03,989
- actor.
- Okay.

1028
00:39:03,989 --> 00:39:06,689
- He shyly shared that.
- Korean...

1029
00:39:06,689 --> 00:39:08,960
(He shyly shares about his acting career.)

1030
00:39:09,029 --> 00:39:10,930
Hey, I told you to educate them properly.

1031
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:13,000
- I can't respect rude people.
- What is this?

1032
00:39:13,129 --> 00:39:14,169
No!

1033
00:39:15,129 --> 00:39:17,569
- What is this?
- Gosh.

1034
00:39:17,569 --> 00:39:18,839
- What is this?
- What?

1035
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:20,569
- He is an actor.
- He is.

1036
00:39:20,569 --> 00:39:22,680
- He's an actor.
- Really? My goodness. No way.

1037
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,640
(Actor Kim Hee Min,
the frowning actor from the old days)

1038
00:39:24,779 --> 00:39:26,379
- Hey, make sure to clean up.
- Look how young he looks.

1039
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,680
He looks handsome.

1040
00:39:28,549 --> 00:39:31,250
- On TV shows.
- Yes. Korean...

1041
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,419
TV show at MBC.

1042
00:39:35,359 --> 00:39:36,890
- That's not wrong, per se.
- An actor from MBC.

1043
00:39:36,890 --> 00:39:38,560
He's the son of MBC.

1044
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,859
But really, my favorite is Netflix...

1045
00:39:40,859 --> 00:39:44,100
because nowadays,
they have a lot of Korean content.

1046
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:45,370
Gosh. He watched Korean dramas.

1047
00:39:45,370 --> 00:39:47,500
They're very popular.
And Korean shows have...

1048
00:39:47,500 --> 00:39:50,140
very good visual effects
and very good quality.

1049
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:54,339
That's why you were interested
in Korean TV shows. Right?

1050
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:56,480
- Yes. I like all cultures.
- Gosh.

1051
00:39:56,580 --> 00:39:57,710
So...

1052
00:39:58,239 --> 00:40:00,450
we don't have...

1053
00:40:00,549 --> 00:40:03,279
a lot of information
about your company, Modi.

1054
00:40:03,279 --> 00:40:06,719
Could you please introduce
about your company?

1055
00:40:06,719 --> 00:40:09,560
Gosh, Pani Bottle is so reliable.
He asked a nice question.

1056
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:12,689
So Modi Group was started by my father.

1057
00:40:13,160 --> 00:40:17,230
We are involved in many industries
like textiles, sugar, tea,

1058
00:40:17,730 --> 00:40:18,870
cement...

1059
00:40:18,870 --> 00:40:20,730
- Let's see.
- That's a big range.

1060
00:40:21,069 --> 00:40:23,939
The last one was
for the mobile telephones.

1061
00:40:24,169 --> 00:40:25,669
- Every time, we were...
- Mobile?

1062
00:40:25,669 --> 00:40:27,509
the first people to bring the technology.

1063
00:40:27,509 --> 00:40:29,640
Sugar, cement, and mobile industries.

1064
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,680
So, I think that created a lot of value.

1065
00:40:35,379 --> 00:40:37,879
The value of the company
became much higher...

1066
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:41,489
He must have wanted to share
about his company.

1067
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:43,790
The house is old. Everything is old.

1068
00:40:44,020 --> 00:40:47,460
So here in India, everything is new.
There was nothing there.

1069
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:48,560
More chances.

1070
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,759
Modern and new technology.

1071
00:40:52,060 --> 00:40:54,870
Now, again, we're changing the matter.

1072
00:40:54,870 --> 00:40:57,870
of building materials,
glass, and everything.

1073
00:40:57,870 --> 00:41:00,710
- So...
- I don't get what he's saying at all.

1074
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,210
Not at all.

1075
00:41:03,810 --> 00:41:05,450
(Glancing)

1076
00:41:05,450 --> 00:41:07,379
I think he seems
to be understanding the chairman.

1077
00:41:07,379 --> 00:41:11,020
Like America. America also built...

1078
00:41:12,189 --> 00:41:15,660
He runs cement, sugar,
and mobile businesses.

1079
00:41:16,589 --> 00:41:18,259
Wait. He changed the subject.

1080
00:41:18,259 --> 00:41:20,790
Why do you keep repeating those three?

1081
00:41:22,089 --> 00:41:24,259
(Can you interpret for me?)

1082
00:41:24,500 --> 00:41:27,169
I think, in the next 30 years,
there will be...

1083
00:41:27,330 --> 00:41:29,569
I think his eyes seem distracted too.

1084
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,910
I think Kian84...

1085
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,580
- wanted me to interpret.
- What's wrong with him?

1086
00:41:36,379 --> 00:41:38,879
- What's wrong with him?
- He looks like a granny.

1087
00:41:38,879 --> 00:41:40,549
- Like my grandma in my hometown.
- I mean...

1088
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:42,219
He looks like he's sitting
in a rocking chair.

1089
00:41:42,219 --> 00:41:44,219
- Wait. What on earth happened?
- Right.

1090
00:41:44,219 --> 00:41:46,219
- The interview is funnier. Seriously.
- What?

1091
00:41:46,250 --> 00:41:47,419
- I mean...
- He wasn't feeling well either.

1092
00:41:47,419 --> 00:41:48,689
- He wasn't?
- Really?

1093
00:41:48,689 --> 00:41:50,120
- His condition kept getting worse.
- Some people might think...

1094
00:41:50,120 --> 00:41:52,629
he rolled down the staircase
and hurt his legs.

1095
00:41:52,629 --> 00:41:54,529
- That's...
- Why did he do that?

1096
00:41:54,529 --> 00:41:55,629
(But he has a healthy smile.)

1097
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,529
I think Kian84...

1098
00:41:58,529 --> 00:42:01,399
wanted me to interpret.

1099
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:04,000
But I really didn't get it.

1100
00:42:04,169 --> 00:42:05,939
And we were far from him too.

1101
00:42:06,509 --> 00:42:08,009
I couldn't hear him well.

1102
00:42:08,009 --> 00:42:10,379
Right. He had to nod
when the chairman was talking.

1103
00:42:10,379 --> 00:42:11,980
(Listening intently)

1104
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:15,520
That is why
India could be the land of peace.

1105
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:18,379
- Peace.
- And harmony. And equality.

1106
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:20,290
Quality.

1107
00:42:20,290 --> 00:42:21,319
"Quality."

1108
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:22,890
(The guy next to him understands it
however he wants to.)

1109
00:42:23,020 --> 00:42:26,859
So India can build
a new type of big country.

1110
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:28,730
- Big country.
- Yes.

1111
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:30,299
Big countryside.

1112
00:42:30,299 --> 00:42:31,560
- "Big countryside."
- "Big countryside."

1113
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,969
He's trying to hold back his laughter.

1114
00:42:32,969 --> 00:42:35,029
I can somewhat understand him.

1115
00:42:35,029 --> 00:42:38,239
So there are a lot of people in India.
That's why everything will be new.

1116
00:42:38,239 --> 00:42:40,310
That's what he said.
He's talking about India.

1117
00:42:40,310 --> 00:42:41,339
- Really?
- Yes.

1118
00:42:41,339 --> 00:42:43,180
He understood
at least half of what the chairman said.

1119
00:42:43,180 --> 00:42:45,279
- He gave them nice information.
- Yes.

1120
00:42:45,549 --> 00:42:48,549
Modi, you are... I think...

1121
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:49,850
A question?

1122
00:42:49,850 --> 00:42:51,149
- He's confident.
- Great.

1123
00:42:51,149 --> 00:42:52,290
- Be confident.
- He has a question for you.

1124
00:42:52,290 --> 00:42:54,450
Do you know the Korean CEO,

1125
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,560
Lee Jae Yong?

1126
00:42:56,419 --> 00:42:59,230
Friendly? Koo Kwang Mo?

1127
00:42:59,460 --> 00:43:01,390
- Korean companies.
- That was random.

1128
00:43:01,660 --> 00:43:04,060
I was wondering if he was friends
with Korean chairmen too.

1129
00:43:04,560 --> 00:43:05,830
I know Samsung.

1130
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:07,799
- Samsung.
- Samsung.

1131
00:43:08,169 --> 00:43:09,770
I used to know before...

1132
00:43:09,770 --> 00:43:12,640
because I knew Korea Xerox at that time.

1133
00:43:12,870 --> 00:43:14,169
That's cool.

1134
00:43:14,410 --> 00:43:17,480
There are a lot of Korean companies
I'm aware of.

1135
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,480
But recently,
I've been working with the US more.

1136
00:43:21,009 --> 00:43:23,649
- He works with the US more.
- I see. With the US.

1137
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:26,689
I built this house to come back...

1138
00:43:26,689 --> 00:43:28,120
- Here?
- Yes.

1139
00:43:28,549 --> 00:43:30,859
I guess he has another house.

1140
00:43:30,859 --> 00:43:32,759
- Really?
- He said he built this one.

1141
00:43:32,759 --> 00:43:34,660
- Your second house?
- Yes.

1142
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:37,129
- Yes, it's my getaway. Only I live here.
- "Second house?"

1143
00:43:37,129 --> 00:43:40,830
- Because I have to meet a lot of people.
- I see. He meets them there.

1144
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,299
So I have a social life.

1145
00:43:42,299 --> 00:43:44,399
- He has meetings here,
- Yes.

1146
00:43:44,399 --> 00:43:46,509
- parties, and so on.
- Parties.

1147
00:43:47,270 --> 00:43:49,279
Then is it possible for us...

1148
00:43:49,279 --> 00:43:51,939
- to look around the house?
- I see.

1149
00:43:51,939 --> 00:43:54,009
- He wants to look around this house.
- Yes.

1150
00:43:54,009 --> 00:43:55,850
- Yes.
- Okay?

1151
00:43:55,850 --> 00:43:56,879
(Chuckling)

1152
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,180
Thank you.

1153
00:43:59,020 --> 00:44:00,620
- Come.
- Gosh, he'll give them the tour.

1154
00:44:00,620 --> 00:44:02,259
- Gosh.
- The chairman gave us the tour.

1155
00:44:04,219 --> 00:44:05,259
What's that?

1156
00:44:05,259 --> 00:44:06,759
(How will the inside of his house look?)

1157
00:44:07,989 --> 00:44:09,830
This is our dining area.

1158
00:44:10,259 --> 00:44:13,230
Gosh. This is really nice.

1159
00:44:13,299 --> 00:44:14,330
This way.

1160
00:44:14,330 --> 00:44:15,640
(A clean kitchen
where the chef prepares food for guests)

1161
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:17,569
- He's cooking now.
- There's a chef too.

1162
00:44:17,569 --> 00:44:18,939
I'm curious about the food too.

1163
00:44:18,939 --> 00:44:20,339
Gosh. He seems trustworthy.

1164
00:44:21,169 --> 00:44:23,509
(The next room after the kitchen is...)

1165
00:44:23,540 --> 00:44:24,640
My bedroom.

1166
00:44:24,680 --> 00:44:26,210
He doesn't mind showing this to us?

1167
00:44:27,149 --> 00:44:29,549
(Amazed)

1168
00:44:31,049 --> 00:44:32,850
He even showed us his bedroom.

1169
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,319
I guess
he really spends time in the house.

1170
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:39,060
Is this also the midcentury modern style?

1171
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,629
(Laughing)

1172
00:44:40,859 --> 00:44:42,529
- Gosh. Prime Minister Modi.
- Modi.

1173
00:44:43,200 --> 00:44:44,399
- What?
- That's Modi?

1174
00:44:44,399 --> 00:44:46,230
- Prime Minister Modi.
- Gosh.

1175
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:47,870
Yes.

1176
00:44:49,439 --> 00:44:52,270
I see. Chairman Modi loves clothes too.

1177
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:54,569
- He's fashionable.
- Yes.

1178
00:44:54,569 --> 00:44:55,810
(The most luxurious dressing room)

1179
00:44:55,810 --> 00:44:57,810
- It's like a clothing store.
- Yes.

1180
00:44:57,810 --> 00:44:58,910
This has winter clothes.

1181
00:44:59,350 --> 00:45:00,609
- Summer clothes.
- Summer.

1182
00:45:01,279 --> 00:45:03,049
- Gosh.
- It was like...

1183
00:45:03,719 --> 00:45:05,379
- He has a lot of hats too.
- Yes.

1184
00:45:05,379 --> 00:45:07,149
What do you think?
I don't know much about fashion.

1185
00:45:07,149 --> 00:45:08,189
- Really?
- Yes.

1186
00:45:08,290 --> 00:45:09,390
(Glancing)

1187
00:45:09,390 --> 00:45:11,160
The hat he's wearing now...

1188
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:14,989
- Your hat is very beautiful.
- Yes.

1189
00:45:15,560 --> 00:45:17,660
- A real diamond?
- Diamond.

1190
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:19,000
- Real?
- Yes.

1191
00:45:19,270 --> 00:45:20,330
(He has only heard about real diamonds.)

1192
00:45:20,330 --> 00:45:21,430
- That's a real diamond?
- That must cost...

1193
00:45:21,430 --> 00:45:22,540
- tens of millions of dollars.
- What?

1194
00:45:22,540 --> 00:45:24,569
- Isn't that too big to be a real diamond?
- Right.

1195
00:45:24,569 --> 00:45:25,739
That's a hip-hop vibe.

1196
00:45:26,609 --> 00:45:27,839
Real?

1197
00:45:27,839 --> 00:45:28,839
Of course.

1198
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:30,279
(Chuckling)

1199
00:45:30,839 --> 00:45:32,750
That rock... That's huge.

1200
00:45:33,379 --> 00:45:34,779
(Looking humble)

1201
00:45:34,779 --> 00:45:35,779
"Rock."

1202
00:45:35,779 --> 00:45:37,120
(The huge rock
is placing him in his place.)

1203
00:45:37,120 --> 00:45:38,219
Real?

1204
00:45:38,219 --> 00:45:40,450
- Yes. India is a kind of diamond, right?
- Yes.

1205
00:45:40,750 --> 00:45:42,759
- He couldn't believe it.
- Unbelievable.

1206
00:45:43,089 --> 00:45:44,819
It's a real diamond. I had no idea.

1207
00:45:45,390 --> 00:45:47,390
(He exits the room quietly,
leaving them in shock.)

1208
00:45:48,029 --> 00:45:49,830
(The cool guy introduces the next place.)

1209
00:45:49,830 --> 00:45:51,060
Gosh. This place is amazing.

1210
00:45:52,330 --> 00:45:53,569
It's a swimming pool.

1211
00:45:54,230 --> 00:45:55,939
(Passing by the refreshing green trees...)

1212
00:45:55,939 --> 00:45:57,040
A swimming pool.

1213
00:45:57,939 --> 00:45:59,410
- Okay.
- Nice.

1214
00:45:59,410 --> 00:46:00,770
(A cool swimming pool comes into view)

1215
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:02,310
- I feel like I'm watching a movie.
- Gosh.

1216
00:46:02,310 --> 00:46:03,480
- This is so nice.
- Right?

1217
00:46:03,839 --> 00:46:05,379
- That's the Jacuzzi.
- Jacuzzi.

1218
00:46:05,379 --> 00:46:06,379
Jacuzzi?

1219
00:46:06,379 --> 00:46:07,850
I wanted to be loyal to him.

1220
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,350
- To the chairman?
- Yes.

1221
00:46:10,350 --> 00:46:11,950
- You should have asked for his number.
- Yes.

1222
00:46:12,250 --> 00:46:14,049
- Do you want to go down and look?
- Yes.

1223
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:18,660
The swimming pool is really nice.

1224
00:46:19,629 --> 00:46:21,060
You can swim together.

1225
00:46:21,489 --> 00:46:22,629
- Together?
- Sure.

1226
00:46:23,330 --> 00:46:25,259
- Yes, maybe. You can swim.
- Yes.

1227
00:46:25,560 --> 00:46:27,830
- Gosh. Thank you. Okay.
- Do you want to try it?

1228
00:46:27,830 --> 00:46:29,029
I like it.

1229
00:46:29,029 --> 00:46:30,270
This is nice. When do you want to swim?

1230
00:46:30,270 --> 00:46:33,239
What? I mean, I can even swim now.

1231
00:46:34,069 --> 00:46:35,210
If he tells me to go in,

1232
00:46:35,210 --> 00:46:36,739
- I'll dive right in.
- Of course.

1233
00:46:36,739 --> 00:46:38,339
Exactly. I would too.

1234
00:46:39,009 --> 00:46:40,480
- He wants to go in now.
- Now?

1235
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:41,509
(Splashing)

1236
00:46:42,410 --> 00:46:43,819
- You see?
- It's really nice.

1237
00:46:43,819 --> 00:46:45,450
Why did he smell the water?

1238
00:46:45,450 --> 00:46:48,020
(After drinking the water
from Mother Ganga in Varanasi,)

1239
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:50,719
(whenever he sees water,
he touches it first.)

1240
00:46:50,719 --> 00:46:52,319
- How did the water smell?
- It smelled great.

1241
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:53,629
- It was great?
- Yes.

1242
00:46:54,259 --> 00:46:55,960
- I'm kind of hungry, though.
- Right?

1243
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,160
Let's go and eat.

1244
00:46:57,160 --> 00:46:59,169
- I can't wait to see the meal.
- Yes.

1245
00:47:00,730 --> 00:47:01,770
Thank you.

1246
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,640
(Chairman Modi invited them to lunch.)

1247
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,009
(Amazed)

1248
00:47:06,009 --> 00:47:07,370
Look how big the table is.

1249
00:47:07,469 --> 00:47:08,640
- Look at the size.
- That's the table?

1250
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,140
- Isn't that a pool table?
- That's the table.

1251
00:47:10,140 --> 00:47:11,739
(It's big enough to play pool on it.)

1252
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:14,580
Gosh.

1253
00:47:14,580 --> 00:47:16,549
- Naan.
- It smells amazing.

1254
00:47:16,549 --> 00:47:18,279
What's that? It looks so tasty.

1255
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,850
Gosh. They served us just enough rice.

1256
00:47:20,850 --> 00:47:22,350
It looks really fancy.

1257
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:26,689
- He's smelling the food?
- Gosh.

1258
00:47:26,689 --> 00:47:28,359
He's smelling it like a puppy.

1259
00:47:28,589 --> 00:47:30,730
(The older guy starts smelling it first.)

1260
00:47:32,160 --> 00:47:33,230
Gosh, that looks good.

1261
00:47:33,529 --> 00:47:37,239
(The younger guy salivates at the food.)

1262
00:47:37,969 --> 00:47:39,540
- Is this water?
- The water.

1263
00:47:40,339 --> 00:47:41,410
From Norway. Gosh.

1264
00:47:41,410 --> 00:47:42,910
- Isn't that expensive water?
- That's...

1265
00:47:42,910 --> 00:47:44,040
- The soft one.
- Yes. That.

1266
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:45,210
(Even a glass of water is different
at Modi's table.)

1267
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:47,279
This is the Indian platter.

1268
00:47:47,779 --> 00:47:49,480
It's vegetarian food called thali.

1269
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:50,520
Thali.

1270
00:47:51,149 --> 00:47:52,549
(Thali?)

1271
00:47:52,549 --> 00:47:55,089
There are three types of curry.

1272
00:47:55,589 --> 00:47:57,790
There are so many types of curry.

1273
00:47:57,790 --> 00:47:58,819
In India?

1274
00:47:59,330 --> 00:48:02,230
(The curry paradise, India)

1275
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:06,430
(Thali - A meal with a lot of curry, rice,
bread, and vegetables served on a tray)

1276
00:48:06,899 --> 00:48:09,100
Curry is equivalent to stew in Korea.

1277
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,600
We have doenjang jjigae and kimchi jjigae.

1278
00:48:10,600 --> 00:48:12,239
- Right.
- We have all kinds of stew.

1279
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:15,239
(Many kinds of Indian bread
are always included in thali.)

1280
00:48:15,410 --> 00:48:19,140
(The bread varies based on the dough
and the methods of baking.)

1281
00:48:19,779 --> 00:48:21,710
(Naan, chapati, and puri)

1282
00:48:21,879 --> 00:48:22,980
Please.

1283
00:48:23,250 --> 00:48:25,080
(Focused)

1284
00:48:25,719 --> 00:48:26,719
(Grabbing)

1285
00:48:26,719 --> 00:48:27,919
Right. With his hands.

1286
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,489
Yes.

1287
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,589
- It's made of special ingredients.
- You should do what he does. Right.

1288
00:48:31,589 --> 00:48:33,230
(Putting it away)

1289
00:48:33,489 --> 00:48:34,560
They usually eat with their hands.

1290
00:48:34,560 --> 00:48:36,799
- Right. That's their food culture.
- That's being respectful.

1291
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,000
- This is good.
- Gosh, it looks good.

1292
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:41,370
This is cheese.

1293
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:43,169
(He dips it in the curry
just like Pani Bottle.)

1294
00:48:43,540 --> 00:48:45,000
(Biting off and humming)

1295
00:48:46,509 --> 00:48:47,609
(Munching)

1296
00:48:47,609 --> 00:48:48,710
Lentils.

1297
00:48:50,339 --> 00:48:51,680
This is so good.

1298
00:48:51,680 --> 00:48:53,549
I wonder how it tasted. I'm so curious.

1299
00:48:56,480 --> 00:48:57,719
I love this.

1300
00:48:58,049 --> 00:48:59,890
(They're enjoying the food.)

1301
00:49:00,689 --> 00:49:02,149
- Can I lift and eat it? It's so good.
- Yes.

1302
00:49:02,149 --> 00:49:03,390
- Gosh.
- Eat up.

1303
00:49:04,589 --> 00:49:06,859
(Unleashing his appetite)

1304
00:49:06,859 --> 00:49:08,230
Pani Bottle ate a lot.

1305
00:49:08,230 --> 00:49:09,600
It's different. It tastes fancy.

1306
00:49:09,600 --> 00:49:10,660
(Pani Bottle can't stop eating
after trying the thali.)

1307
00:49:10,660 --> 00:49:11,759
His appetite is activated.

1308
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:14,469
He started waiting for us at dawn.

1309
00:49:14,469 --> 00:49:16,040
So he didn't have any food.

1310
00:49:16,040 --> 00:49:17,140
Gosh.

1311
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:19,100
It tastes like red bean porridge.
It's tasty.

1312
00:49:19,810 --> 00:49:20,839
(Taking a big bite)

1313
00:49:21,569 --> 00:49:23,379
Gosh. Kian84 is enjoying it too.

1314
00:49:23,379 --> 00:49:25,980
It was even better
after having the meal on the train.

1315
00:49:26,379 --> 00:49:28,009
(The nightmare of the awful curry)

1316
00:49:28,950 --> 00:49:31,419
(He's eating with gusto now.)

1317
00:49:31,419 --> 00:49:33,719
In my school, they teach...

1318
00:49:34,549 --> 00:49:37,259
in English. And we have four thousand...

1319
00:49:37,259 --> 00:49:39,259
It's been such a long time
since I saw him eat in a chair.

1320
00:49:39,589 --> 00:49:40,629
Right.

1321
00:49:40,629 --> 00:49:42,529
People should eat with class.

1322
00:49:42,930 --> 00:49:44,259
This is vegetable.

1323
00:49:44,259 --> 00:49:46,029
(Eating with class)

1324
00:49:46,270 --> 00:49:48,129
(He also tries to eat with class.)

1325
00:49:48,129 --> 00:49:49,339
It's like chips.

1326
00:49:49,339 --> 00:49:50,870
He's enjoying the food a lot.

1327
00:49:50,870 --> 00:49:52,540
- It's like eating pastries.
- Yes. It's crispy.

1328
00:49:53,140 --> 00:49:54,710
It sounded crispy too.

1329
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:55,870
Gosh. Great.

1330
00:49:55,870 --> 00:49:57,739
For the first time, I want to try that.

1331
00:49:57,739 --> 00:49:58,779
Right.

1332
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:01,210
I really didn't like Indian food.

1333
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:04,919
(After having food in India...)

1334
00:50:04,919 --> 00:50:06,350
Just like me,

1335
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,390
when Pani Bottle came to India,
he got sick from the food.

1336
00:50:08,390 --> 00:50:10,160
The food didn't agree with him.

1337
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:13,029
The moment I ate it,
all the curry was tasty.

1338
00:50:13,029 --> 00:50:14,460
Everything was perfect.

1339
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,100
(Happy)

1340
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,430
- He seems really happy.
- He seems better now.

1341
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:20,969
(He's happy to see them enjoy the food.)

1342
00:50:21,770 --> 00:50:23,469
Already been to Varanasi?

1343
00:50:24,100 --> 00:50:25,439
He came from Varanasi.

1344
00:50:25,770 --> 00:50:27,540
My college was in Varanasi.

1345
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:28,609
(I see.)

1346
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:30,239
- Hindu University.
- Yes.

1347
00:50:30,239 --> 00:50:31,379
I know.

1348
00:50:31,379 --> 00:50:33,009
How do you say "graduate" in English?

1349
00:50:33,310 --> 00:50:34,710
"Graduate."

1350
00:50:34,710 --> 00:50:36,149
- "Graduate."
- "Graduate."

1351
00:50:36,549 --> 00:50:38,080
- You...
- Graduate.

1352
00:50:38,080 --> 00:50:40,890
- Did you "great" from the university?
- He graduated.

1353
00:50:40,890 --> 00:50:41,919
Yes.

1354
00:50:42,290 --> 00:50:43,520
"Sure."

1355
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,060
Did you study for four years?

1356
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:47,460
- Study...
- How many years did you study...

1357
00:50:47,460 --> 00:50:49,399
- in the university?
- The university.

1358
00:50:49,399 --> 00:50:50,460
- Five years.
- Five years.

1359
00:50:50,460 --> 00:50:51,859
- They study for five years.
- I see.

1360
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:53,770
If it took him five years,

1361
00:50:53,770 --> 00:50:55,500
he must have gotten the AP.

1362
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:57,069
- What's that?
- The academic probation.

1363
00:50:57,739 --> 00:51:00,310
Is that why it took him five years?

1364
00:51:00,540 --> 00:51:02,810
I can't believe I said such a rude thing.

1365
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:06,680
Don't people graduate from universities
in four years in the US as well?

1366
00:51:06,680 --> 00:51:07,950
Sometimes, this crosses my mind.

1367
00:51:07,950 --> 00:51:10,480
It's a relief that
you can't speak English.

1368
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:12,250
(Coughing)

1369
00:51:12,250 --> 00:51:13,250
If you could speak English,

1370
00:51:13,250 --> 00:51:14,620
- But... No.
- you could have offended people.

1371
00:51:14,620 --> 00:51:15,620
Right. I wouldn't have asked.

1372
00:51:15,620 --> 00:51:17,160
- He could have gotten kicked out.
- Right.

1373
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:19,189
(He's acting rude as if
that's the most natural thing to do.)

1374
00:51:19,890 --> 00:51:21,029
I'm full now.

1375
00:51:21,029 --> 00:51:22,089
- Right?
- Yes.

1376
00:51:22,089 --> 00:51:25,029
I feel like I had a proper meal
for the first time in India.

1377
00:51:25,029 --> 00:51:26,069
Seriously.

1378
00:51:26,069 --> 00:51:27,200
(Very satisfied)

1379
00:51:28,129 --> 00:51:29,640
Gosh. I'm sleepy now.

1380
00:51:29,899 --> 00:51:31,640
- He must have enjoyed the food a lot.
- Should we ask him?

1381
00:51:31,939 --> 00:51:33,140
If we can sleep here?

1382
00:51:33,540 --> 00:51:34,839
- The best scenario is...
- Ask him like this.

1383
00:51:34,839 --> 00:51:36,279
"Chairman Modi,"

1384
00:51:36,279 --> 00:51:37,609
"aren't you sleepy?"

1385
00:51:37,609 --> 00:51:38,879
You're the rude one.

1386
00:51:38,879 --> 00:51:40,310
- Why are you asking me to say that?
- Right.

1387
00:51:40,310 --> 00:51:42,350
He's like,
"Why should I have to say that?"

1388
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:43,719
(He's unstoppable.)

1389
00:51:43,719 --> 00:51:46,020
We should have had Dex with us.

1390
00:51:46,350 --> 00:51:47,850
So I could smooth things over?

1391
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,390
- You would've been so friendly.
- Right.

1392
00:51:49,390 --> 00:51:51,259
- "Brother Modi."
- "Brother Modi."

1393
00:51:51,259 --> 00:51:53,160
- "Brother Modi."
- I would've gotten jealous again.

1394
00:51:53,160 --> 00:51:55,259
- "How dare he say that to the chairman?"
- You would be jealous.

1395
00:51:55,259 --> 00:51:57,060
- He would turn on his camera.
- "When did he get so close?"

1396
00:51:57,060 --> 00:51:58,529
- He would say, "I'm jealous."
- I would take pictures with him.

1397
00:51:58,529 --> 00:52:00,430
- I'd take pictures with him.
- "I want to be friends with him too."

1398
00:52:01,930 --> 00:52:04,040
(Luckily, they finish lunch,
free of jealousy.)

1399
00:52:04,399 --> 00:52:06,370
If he doesn't mind, how about a selfie?

1400
00:52:06,370 --> 00:52:08,140
- Of course.
- Okay.

1401
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,680
Thank you.

1402
00:52:10,140 --> 00:52:11,910
- Modi.
- Yes.

1403
00:52:12,850 --> 00:52:14,250
(Showing off his diamond)

1404
00:52:14,609 --> 00:52:16,419
(Smiling side by side)

1405
00:52:16,549 --> 00:52:17,980
(We're friends from now on.)

1406
00:52:17,980 --> 00:52:20,689
As for Kian84, wherever he goes,
the age doesn't matter.

1407
00:52:20,689 --> 00:52:22,960
- He made a local friend again.
- Right.

1408
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,089
- Gosh.
- Friend Modi.

1409
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:27,189
- Enjoy your time.
- Yes. Boss Modi.

1410
00:52:27,189 --> 00:52:28,529
- Yes.
- Thank you so much.

1411
00:52:28,529 --> 00:52:29,629
- Thank you so much.
- He's busy.

1412
00:52:29,629 --> 00:52:31,600
I have to meet some ministers.
So I have to go.

1413
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:33,430
- The prime minister?
- The prime minister?

1414
00:52:33,430 --> 00:52:34,870
Gosh. He made time to meet us too.

1415
00:52:34,870 --> 00:52:36,739
- That's so cool.
- Let's swim tomorrow.

1416
00:52:36,739 --> 00:52:37,969
(Sounds good.)

1417
00:52:37,969 --> 00:52:39,299
- Okay.
- The rest of the house is yours.

1418
00:52:39,299 --> 00:52:40,469
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1419
00:52:40,469 --> 00:52:42,210
- It's your house.
- Thank you.

1420
00:52:42,210 --> 00:52:44,109
- Thank you.
- You got rich all of a sudden.

1421
00:52:45,009 --> 00:52:46,680
- Enjoy.
- I thought he meant it.

1422
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:47,680
- Enjoy.
- Thank you.

1423
00:52:47,680 --> 00:52:49,649
I wish I could have met the chairman too.

1424
00:52:49,649 --> 00:52:51,850
- Right.
- It's my first time seeing him too.

1425
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:53,319
- What a bummer.
- It's my first time seeing him too.

1426
00:52:53,319 --> 00:52:54,319
- Thank you.
- Enjoy.

1427
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:56,390
Given how things are going,
if we ask nicely,

1428
00:52:56,589 --> 00:52:58,120
we might be able to use his bedroom.

1429
00:52:58,120 --> 00:52:59,219
(Chuckling)

1430
00:53:00,060 --> 00:53:01,489
Should we ask him to give us a few?

1431
00:53:01,489 --> 00:53:02,830
- He's not using them.
- What? Gosh.

1432
00:53:05,259 --> 00:53:06,700
I wonder if Dex went to the hospital.

1433
00:53:06,700 --> 00:53:08,029
Right. Dex...

1434
00:53:08,469 --> 00:53:09,770
(Meanwhile, Dex is resting.)

1435
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:11,140
Oh, no.

1436
00:53:12,500 --> 00:53:15,370
(Getting up)

1437
00:53:16,009 --> 00:53:17,239
I went to the hospital, took my medicine,

1438
00:53:17,239 --> 00:53:19,439
and took a nap. That's what happened.

1439
00:53:19,439 --> 00:53:20,980
(Mirror)

1440
00:53:20,980 --> 00:53:24,419
(He goes to the mirror
as if he's under a spell.)

1441
00:53:24,419 --> 00:53:26,819
I didn't have to slouch my back
after some rest.

1442
00:53:26,819 --> 00:53:29,250
(He fixes his hair
as soon as he wakes up.)

1443
00:53:30,759 --> 00:53:33,430
All right. I'm back now.

1444
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:36,529
I'll hurry up and meet the guys.

1445
00:53:36,930 --> 00:53:39,569
Wait for me, Kian84.
Wait for me, Pani Bottle.

1446
00:53:39,569 --> 00:53:41,430
I stayed behind,
so I had to hurry up and catch up.

1447
00:53:41,430 --> 00:53:43,299
(He's on his way to meet the guys
after feeling refreshed.)

1448
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:46,609
- We can stay here and rest up.
- Yes.

1449
00:53:47,210 --> 00:53:48,669
Then should we go and have dinner?

1450
00:53:48,910 --> 00:53:50,410
Gosh. I want to go to the amusement park.

1451
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:51,910
- The amusement park?
- Yes.

1452
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:53,410
Should I look it up?

1453
00:53:54,279 --> 00:53:55,750
Two guys will go on a date.

1454
00:53:55,750 --> 00:53:57,350
But it ends at 6 p.m.

1455
00:53:57,620 --> 00:53:59,149
- It's iffy. We can't go.
- Gosh.

1456
00:53:59,589 --> 00:54:01,120
Then where should we go tonight?

1457
00:54:01,620 --> 00:54:03,390
Should we go to a club in New Delhi?

1458
00:54:03,390 --> 00:54:04,859
(Should we check out a club in New Delhi?)

1459
00:54:05,060 --> 00:54:06,960
But we should take it easy today.
Don't you think?

1460
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:09,259
- We should rest up today.
- Should we rest up after dinner?

1461
00:54:09,259 --> 00:54:10,560
I'm really fine.

1462
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:11,830
Sure. But...

1463
00:54:11,830 --> 00:54:13,399
(Let's have a relaxing day today.)

1464
00:54:13,870 --> 00:54:15,629
- Dex is almost here.
- Really?

1465
00:54:16,899 --> 00:54:18,000
Let's go.

1466
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:19,810
(The guys hurry out to greet him.)

1467
00:54:22,509 --> 00:54:23,939
If we leave,
we might not be able to come back.

1468
00:54:23,939 --> 00:54:25,040
- Let's just stand here.
- Yes.

1469
00:54:26,210 --> 00:54:27,850
(Peeking)

1470
00:54:27,850 --> 00:54:29,279
- We were worried that...
- Dex.

1471
00:54:29,279 --> 00:54:30,680
if we stepped out,
they wouldn't let us back in.

1472
00:54:30,680 --> 00:54:31,879
- We only stuck out our heads.
- Where is he?

1473
00:54:31,879 --> 00:54:32,879
(Heads sticking out)

1474
00:54:33,219 --> 00:54:35,589
- Dex!
- Over here.

1475
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,319
Pani Bottle!

1476
00:54:37,319 --> 00:54:39,660
(Guys.)

1477
00:54:39,660 --> 00:54:41,129
(I'm here!)

1478
00:54:41,129 --> 00:54:42,330
He looks lively.

1479
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:43,899
Dex has become bright.

1480
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:45,830
(Welcome. We can't go far.)

1481
00:54:45,830 --> 00:54:47,399
Look at them at the door.

1482
00:54:48,230 --> 00:54:50,000
(Like statues)

1483
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,169
Was that why you didn't come out?

1484
00:54:51,169 --> 00:54:52,939
- What?
- Their legs aren't moving at all.

1485
00:54:52,939 --> 00:54:54,210
I didn't want to step outside.

1486
00:54:55,839 --> 00:54:57,339
I came back to life now.

1487
00:54:58,879 --> 00:55:01,450
(Is this the regeneration ability
of a former UDT soldier?)

1488
00:55:01,450 --> 00:55:02,810
How did you come back to life?

1489
00:55:02,810 --> 00:55:04,319
- I didn't want to step outside.
- How funny.

1490
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:05,620
(Amazing)

1491
00:55:05,980 --> 00:55:07,919
- Can I go inside?
- Yes, come inside.

1492
00:55:08,589 --> 00:55:10,219
- My friend.
- We...

1493
00:55:10,219 --> 00:55:11,259
- "My friend?"
- Thank you very much.

1494
00:55:11,259 --> 00:55:12,759
"I'm not a peddler."

1495
00:55:12,919 --> 00:55:14,430
What did you get? A shot?

1496
00:55:14,430 --> 00:55:16,560
- No, the shot...
- Yes?

1497
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:18,759
Honestly, it's quite embarrassing.

1498
00:55:18,859 --> 00:55:21,270
- Had I gotten a shot,
- Yes?

1499
00:55:21,270 --> 00:55:23,839
the pain from earlier
would've been understandable.

1500
00:55:23,839 --> 00:55:26,339
But the doctor said, "It's not that bad."

1501
00:55:26,339 --> 00:55:27,410
- Really?
- Is that so?

1502
00:55:27,739 --> 00:55:29,980
Please ask if he can get an IV drip.

1503
00:55:31,509 --> 00:55:32,810
(He doesn't need one.)

1504
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:34,279
The doctor flat-out said no.

1505
00:55:34,279 --> 00:55:36,549
In the end, the doctor was right
since you got better.

1506
00:55:36,549 --> 00:55:38,719
- Yes.
- She's right. I just took the medicine.

1507
00:55:38,719 --> 00:55:42,319
(Taking the medicine
he was prescribed diligently)

1508
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:43,989
Did you get better
after taking that medicine?

1509
00:55:43,989 --> 00:55:45,989
The medicine worked wonders.

1510
00:55:46,689 --> 00:55:47,989
- Come in.
- Gosh.

1511
00:55:47,989 --> 00:55:51,029
This is our Chairman Modi's house.

1512
00:55:51,330 --> 00:55:52,629
He added "our" to his name.

1513
00:55:52,629 --> 00:55:54,029
They're practically best buddies.

1514
00:55:54,969 --> 00:55:57,069
- But he went to work.
- He had to go to work.

1515
00:55:57,069 --> 00:55:58,939
- Right. He's a busy man.
- Yes.

1516
00:55:59,399 --> 00:56:02,640
Is this really his personal house?

1517
00:56:02,810 --> 00:56:05,109
- He has a few houses.
- This is one out of the few.

1518
00:56:05,109 --> 00:56:06,109
Really?

1519
00:56:06,109 --> 00:56:07,350
- The chairman...
- Yes.

1520
00:56:07,350 --> 00:56:09,180
- For real?
- went to work...

1521
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:10,450
but told us to make ourselves at home.

1522
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:12,719
He said we could use it
like our house before leaving.

1523
00:56:12,719 --> 00:56:13,719
Gosh.

1524
00:56:13,719 --> 00:56:15,790
Didn't Kian84 suddenly get arrogant?

1525
00:56:16,859 --> 00:56:19,259
- Should we go get our stuff first?
- Right?

1526
00:56:19,259 --> 00:56:20,890
- I'm not sure if we can sleep here.
- I see.

1527
00:56:20,890 --> 00:56:22,430
- We can stay here until tomorrow.
- Oh, not that much?

1528
00:56:22,689 --> 00:56:24,359
I saw a badminton court over there.

1529
00:56:24,359 --> 00:56:25,629
Yes, that's the badminton court.

1530
00:56:25,629 --> 00:56:26,700
- How about a match?
- There's a swimming pool.

1531
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:28,270
I'm not that bad at it.

1532
00:56:28,330 --> 00:56:30,000
I bet he has a racket made of gold.

1533
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,569
- He came back to life.
- He's lively now.

1534
00:56:31,569 --> 00:56:33,169
What's in his fridge?

1535
00:56:33,569 --> 00:56:36,140
Either way, we met Pani Bottle...

1536
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:37,839
and became a group of three.

1537
00:56:38,210 --> 00:56:40,049
The two were aware that...

1538
00:56:40,049 --> 00:56:42,109
one person was missing.

1539
00:56:42,109 --> 00:56:45,350
I felt uncomfortable about it.

1540
00:56:45,779 --> 00:56:49,049
So I wanted to show them I was all better.

1541
00:56:49,250 --> 00:56:50,390
(Laughing)

1542
00:56:51,219 --> 00:56:53,129
- By the way, I have a question.
- Okay.

1543
00:56:53,489 --> 00:56:56,060
The interview concept for each of you...

1544
00:56:56,060 --> 00:56:57,859
We had different concepts.

1545
00:56:57,859 --> 00:56:59,000
Why is he at a railway?

1546
00:56:59,000 --> 00:57:00,969
- Isn't that a real railway?
- No.

1547
00:57:00,969 --> 00:57:03,100
- Can you even do that?
- Yes. It looks wrong,

1548
00:57:03,100 --> 00:57:04,739
- but that's a closed railway.
- Oh, it's closed?

1549
00:57:04,739 --> 00:57:06,439
Yes. So no trains were in operation.

1550
00:57:06,439 --> 00:57:08,040
I wanted to listen to the interview...

1551
00:57:08,040 --> 00:57:09,910
- but was anxious a train might pass by.
- Right.

1552
00:57:10,279 --> 00:57:11,779
Don't worry. It's a safe railway.

1553
00:57:11,779 --> 00:57:13,080
- That's a relief.
- Yes,

1554
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:16,210
Fortunately, Dex felt better...

1555
00:57:16,210 --> 00:57:19,149
and joined us.
It felt as if we had become whole.

1556
00:57:19,719 --> 00:57:20,790
I was happy to see him.

1557
00:57:20,790 --> 00:57:22,390
It was fun. Touring a house...

1558
00:57:22,390 --> 00:57:25,819
like Chairman Modi's in India...

1559
00:57:25,819 --> 00:57:27,830
was a special experience,

1560
00:57:27,830 --> 00:57:29,330
so I wanted him to be with us.

1561
00:57:30,000 --> 00:57:31,129
I wanted to swim.

1562
00:57:31,129 --> 00:57:32,129
- Okay.
- I'm in.

1563
00:57:32,129 --> 00:57:33,169
(The three brothers are finally reunited.)

1564
00:57:33,169 --> 00:57:34,569
You're enjoying everything.

1565
00:57:34,569 --> 00:57:36,770
After we rest,
we should go to a Korean place...

1566
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:38,439
if we want meat.

1567
00:57:38,439 --> 00:57:40,339
Okay. Then shall we eat Korean food?

1568
00:57:40,339 --> 00:57:41,910
Korean restaurants will have everything.

1569
00:57:41,910 --> 00:57:43,379
- Let's have Korean food for dinner.
- Okay.

1570
00:57:43,379 --> 00:57:44,839
I started craving Korean food too.

1571
00:57:45,239 --> 00:57:46,509
Then... Gosh.

1572
00:57:46,879 --> 00:57:48,250
(Sitting down)

1573
00:57:48,450 --> 00:57:49,549
I'll look into it.

1574
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:50,980
(Looking up nearby Korean restaurants)

1575
00:57:50,980 --> 00:57:53,719
This is like a five-star hotel.

1576
00:57:55,819 --> 00:57:57,089
- This is...
- Goodness.

1577
00:57:57,089 --> 00:57:58,290
It was nice.

1578
00:57:58,790 --> 00:58:00,089
I can't get used to this.

1579
00:58:00,089 --> 00:58:01,859
- Gosh.
- We were on the "Snowpiercer" yesterday.

1580
00:58:01,859 --> 00:58:03,560
- Right.
- What suddenly happened to us?

1581
00:58:03,700 --> 00:58:05,830
This is the mother river to me.

1582
00:58:06,259 --> 00:58:08,870
- Did you lose your original resolution?
- His mom changed.

1583
00:58:08,870 --> 00:58:11,069
He was very tainted by capitalism.

1584
00:58:11,299 --> 00:58:13,540
People are so fickle.

1585
00:58:13,810 --> 00:58:17,140
My body feels better
now that we're at a nice place.

1586
00:58:18,509 --> 00:58:20,180
There's a place 13 minutes away from here.

1587
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:21,180
- Should we go here?
- A Korean restaurant?

1588
00:58:21,180 --> 00:58:22,210
- Thirteen minutes?
- Yes.

1589
00:58:22,310 --> 00:58:23,549
- Pork belly?
- Yes.

1590
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:25,080
- Nice.
- I think they do have it.

1591
00:58:25,419 --> 00:58:26,419
They even have soju.

1592
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:27,689
(Cheering)

1593
00:58:28,089 --> 00:58:29,890
This place opens at 5:30 p.m.

1594
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:31,219
Let's go when they open.

1595
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:32,359
- Let's go there.
- I'm in.

1596
00:58:32,689 --> 00:58:33,790
(I'm up for it.)

1597
00:58:33,790 --> 00:58:34,930
I'm happy with it.

1598
00:58:35,230 --> 00:58:36,390
Is no one going to swim?

1599
00:58:37,500 --> 00:58:39,100
- Swim?
- Then I'm jumping in.

1600
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,230
Pani Bottle, I'll go get changed.

1601
00:58:42,200 --> 00:58:44,140
- Swim...
- I won't take my top off in front of you.

1602
00:58:44,140 --> 00:58:45,200
- Take it off.
- No.

1603
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,439
- Why not?
- No.

1604
00:58:46,439 --> 00:58:47,839
Gosh, what a nice shot.

1605
00:58:48,169 --> 00:58:50,680
- I won't take it off in front of you.
- Only then can I stand out more.

1606
00:58:52,379 --> 00:58:53,649
I'll go get changed.

1607
00:58:53,649 --> 00:58:54,710
(Smiling)

1608
00:58:55,509 --> 00:58:57,819
- What nice weather.
- It's perfect.

1609
00:58:57,819 --> 00:58:59,580
Should we go in together?
A diving contest?

1610
00:59:00,149 --> 00:59:01,219
Diving?

1611
00:59:01,649 --> 00:59:02,890
- A diving contest?
- Are you keeping your top on?

1612
00:59:02,890 --> 00:59:03,890
Yes.

1613
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:05,859
Am I the only topless person?

1614
00:59:06,730 --> 00:59:09,660
(Dex.)

1615
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:11,730
It's cold.

1616
00:59:11,799 --> 00:59:13,160
- Hold on.
- He's so pale.

1617
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:14,270
Pani Bottle is like soft tofu.

1618
00:59:15,029 --> 00:59:16,939
Why is he so pale?

1619
00:59:16,939 --> 00:59:18,040
(Warming up half-naked)

1620
00:59:18,169 --> 00:59:20,669
I used to be a swimming instructor.

1621
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,169
(In his early 20s,
Dex was a swimming instructor.)

1622
00:59:23,169 --> 00:59:25,140
(Young)

1623
00:59:25,480 --> 00:59:27,450
I'll dive in smoothly, not flashily.

1624
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:28,950
- Really?
- First place?

1625
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:30,379
- You'll go first?
- UDT diving.

1626
00:59:30,379 --> 00:59:31,620
Say "enter" for me.

1627
00:59:31,620 --> 00:59:33,390
- Okay.
- Enter.

1628
00:59:33,390 --> 00:59:34,790
- Enter.
- Enter!

1629
00:59:34,790 --> 00:59:38,390
(Entering)

1630
00:59:40,189 --> 00:59:41,259
(Splashing)

1631
00:59:41,430 --> 00:59:43,500
(This is beauty.)

1632
00:59:43,930 --> 00:59:45,160
This is just "Single's Inferno."

1633
00:59:45,899 --> 00:59:47,000
(Releasing his foxy charms)

1634
00:59:47,000 --> 00:59:48,870
Jump into the water,
and he gets in slow motion.

1635
00:59:48,870 --> 00:59:51,140
But you're not supposed to splash
a lot of water, no?

1636
00:59:51,140 --> 00:59:52,839
- Did I splash a lot?
- Yes, quite.

1637
00:59:52,839 --> 00:59:53,839
I was disappointed.

1638
00:59:54,109 --> 00:59:55,109
Here I go.

1639
00:59:55,109 --> 00:59:56,169
(Dumbfounded)

1640
00:59:56,739 --> 00:59:58,910
I can totally tell
you're going to belly-flop.

1641
00:59:58,910 --> 01:00:00,180
(He'll obviously...)

1642
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:01,210
(do a belly-flop.)

1643
01:00:02,180 --> 01:00:03,819
(Belly-flopping in a weird pose)

1644
01:00:03,819 --> 01:00:05,719
- What's up with my legs?
- Are you a frog?

1645
01:00:05,719 --> 01:00:07,589
It was okay midway.

1646
01:00:07,689 --> 01:00:09,120
(Kian84 is amazing.)

1647
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,160
- He jumped in.
- He got a slow motion too.

1648
01:00:11,160 --> 01:00:12,520
(A powerful jump like a frog)

1649
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:13,629
It's slow motion.

1650
01:00:13,629 --> 01:00:15,589
But it gives off a totally different vibe.

1651
01:00:16,359 --> 01:00:18,029
I should've straightened my legs.

1652
01:00:18,029 --> 01:00:19,029
(Breathing out)

1653
01:00:19,700 --> 01:00:21,529
- You were a frog.
- Right?

1654
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:24,299
(Is it my turn now?)

1655
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:25,939
- I'm getting excited.
- Pani Bottle!

1656
01:00:25,939 --> 01:00:27,969
Pani Bottle is good at swimming.

1657
01:00:27,969 --> 01:00:29,009
- Right?
- The best YouTuber.

1658
01:00:29,009 --> 01:00:31,339
(The legendary diver, Diving Bottle)

1659
01:00:31,609 --> 01:00:33,580
(The hot spring
during the trip to South America)

1660
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:35,279
(Everyone hesitated.)

1661
01:00:35,350 --> 01:00:37,620
(Jumping in)

1662
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,149
He's got strong performance skills.

1663
01:00:40,149 --> 01:00:42,390
(A tough man enters from the face.)

1664
01:00:44,259 --> 01:00:47,060
(Even the local was captivated
by the charming man.)

1665
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:51,460
(Here I go.)

1666
01:00:51,859 --> 01:00:52,859
Enter!

1667
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,069
(Diving in)

1668
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,140
(More impressive than last time)

1669
01:00:57,140 --> 01:00:58,770
Gosh, that was really cool.

1670
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:00,710
- As expected from Pani Bottle.
- Gosh.

1671
01:01:02,410 --> 01:01:04,640
You're really sexy. That's it.

1672
01:01:04,779 --> 01:01:05,939
It must've felt nice.

1673
01:01:05,939 --> 01:01:07,950
Each dive had a different charm.

1674
01:01:08,410 --> 01:01:13,489
(Everyone swims like Pani Bottle.)

1675
01:01:14,120 --> 01:01:15,489
Goodness, look at him.

1676
01:01:16,120 --> 01:01:17,660
How passionate.

1677
01:01:17,660 --> 01:01:19,290
(Doing the butterfly stroke with his face)

1678
01:01:19,759 --> 01:01:20,759
(Excited)

1679
01:01:20,759 --> 01:01:22,960
- That was exciting for some reason.
- Yes.

1680
01:01:22,960 --> 01:01:25,359
You know, swimming in clean water.

1681
01:01:25,430 --> 01:01:27,100
- He's not even breathing.
- Right?

1682
01:01:27,100 --> 01:01:29,500
(Frog84 is swimming with his face.)

1683
01:01:30,239 --> 01:01:31,239
(Is this India or paradise?)

1684
01:01:31,239 --> 01:01:34,140
Since I felt better, my spirits went up.

1685
01:01:34,140 --> 01:01:35,239
It was really great.

1686
01:01:35,469 --> 01:01:38,279
I'm glad to see Dex feeling better.

1687
01:01:38,609 --> 01:01:40,609
(Refreshed)

1688
01:01:41,009 --> 01:01:43,210
(Happy)

1689
01:01:43,819 --> 01:01:44,950
A swimming competition?

1690
01:01:45,419 --> 01:01:46,989
- A swimming competition?
- A swimming competition.

1691
01:01:46,989 --> 01:01:48,189
(The youngest wants
a swimming competition.)

1692
01:01:48,189 --> 01:01:49,549
I'm excited to see this.

1693
01:01:50,359 --> 01:01:52,219
How about a round trip
with that as the halfway point?

1694
01:01:52,319 --> 01:01:53,890
- Let's do a round trip.
- Okay.

1695
01:01:54,460 --> 01:01:56,730
I'll wait until you guys get
to the halfway point.

1696
01:01:56,730 --> 01:01:57,730
You'll wait?

1697
01:01:57,730 --> 01:01:59,560
I'll start when the first person
reaches the halfway point.

1698
01:01:59,560 --> 01:02:01,469
- That's kind of annoying.
- Right?

1699
01:02:01,469 --> 01:02:02,569
Look at him all confident.

1700
01:02:02,669 --> 01:02:04,270
- Let's do it.
- Okay.

1701
01:02:04,600 --> 01:02:05,739
Go.

1702
01:02:05,739 --> 01:02:07,609
(Go.)

1703
01:02:07,739 --> 01:02:08,739
Go.

1704
01:02:09,739 --> 01:02:12,609
(They quickly swim forth from the start.)

1705
01:02:15,850 --> 01:02:17,180
(The halfway point)

1706
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:19,419
(Dex starts right away.)

1707
01:02:20,489 --> 01:02:23,290
(They cross each other from the start.)

1708
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:25,890
He's fast.

1709
01:02:25,890 --> 01:02:27,489
(He made it to the halfway point
in no time.)

1710
01:02:28,790 --> 01:02:29,790
(Dex, Pani Bottle)

1711
01:02:29,790 --> 01:02:31,930
(Dex easily passes Pani Bottle.)

1712
01:02:32,759 --> 01:02:35,399
(His next target is Kian84.)

1713
01:02:36,340 --> 01:02:38,909
(Dex chases after Kian84 fiercely.)

1714
01:02:39,750 --> 01:02:42,409
(An unpredictable tight match)

1715
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,650
(Kian84 arrives first.)

1716
01:02:47,820 --> 01:02:50,489
(It was a close call,
but Dex came in 2nd.)

1717
01:02:50,619 --> 01:02:51,989
(Pani Bottle was out a long time ago.)

1718
01:02:51,989 --> 01:02:53,329
You're fast.

1719
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:55,159
- You're really fast.
- I agree.

1720
01:02:55,530 --> 01:02:57,329
He was so good at swimming.

1721
01:02:57,329 --> 01:02:58,429
(But I still won.)

1722
01:02:59,260 --> 01:03:02,800
(It's the definition of romantic
and relaxing.)

1723
01:03:02,800 --> 01:03:06,440
(They swim to their hearts' content.)

1724
01:03:07,769 --> 01:03:10,679
(Sleeping soundly)

1725
01:03:10,840 --> 01:03:13,409
They're enjoying India in various ways.

1726
01:03:14,679 --> 01:03:17,050
Pani Bottle, do you know
how to make donuts inside the water?

1727
01:03:17,820 --> 01:03:18,880
I don't.

1728
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:20,190
(What's that?)

1729
01:03:20,449 --> 01:03:21,989
Are you going to do something
inside the water?

1730
01:03:21,989 --> 01:03:23,059
Yes, we're doing something.

1731
01:03:23,059 --> 01:03:24,059
Donuts?

1732
01:03:24,059 --> 01:03:25,789
(Kian84, who was lying down,
is suddenly interested.)

1733
01:03:26,389 --> 01:03:28,190
It's not difficult. Here I go.

1734
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:31,030
(Going underwater)

1735
01:03:34,769 --> 01:03:37,599
(He went into the water
with overflowing confidence.)

1736
01:03:41,840 --> 01:03:43,980
He's good. He can make good ones.

1737
01:03:45,210 --> 01:03:47,250
- It's driving me crazy.
- It's like a commercial.

1738
01:03:47,250 --> 01:03:49,210
(He spurts freshness from his mouth.)

1739
01:03:50,780 --> 01:03:51,780
(Even the ending is perfect.)

1740
01:03:51,780 --> 01:03:52,780
Did you get it?

1741
01:03:54,789 --> 01:03:56,050
(Getting up)

1742
01:03:56,690 --> 01:03:57,760
Let me see.

1743
01:03:59,489 --> 01:04:01,760
(Curious)

1744
01:04:02,829 --> 01:04:04,099
Why are you so good?

1745
01:04:04,630 --> 01:04:06,130
(Staring)

1746
01:04:06,130 --> 01:04:07,869
Let me try swimming underwater.

1747
01:04:07,869 --> 01:04:09,070
Swimming underwater?

1748
01:04:09,070 --> 01:04:10,369
- Swimming underwater.
- Kian84 is competitive.

1749
01:04:10,369 --> 01:04:11,369
I'll come from that side.

1750
01:04:11,400 --> 01:04:13,070
It feels like
I became a professional cameraman.

1751
01:04:13,070 --> 01:04:15,340
- Can you lower the angle?
- Sure.

1752
01:04:15,840 --> 01:04:17,340
Can you move a little farther away?

1753
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,409
(The actor has many requests.)

1754
01:04:18,679 --> 01:04:19,809
Okay. Here I go.

1755
01:04:19,809 --> 01:04:21,349
I think he will show something cool.

1756
01:04:22,949 --> 01:04:24,619
I'm not bad underwater.

1757
01:04:27,449 --> 01:04:30,860
(He shows off his swimming skills.)

1758
01:04:30,860 --> 01:04:32,460
Doesn't he look like a poisonous toad?

1759
01:04:32,789 --> 01:04:33,960
I look so ugly.

1760
01:04:33,960 --> 01:04:35,860
- A poisonous toad.
- He looks so deadly.

1761
01:04:35,860 --> 01:04:36,960
Doesn't he look like a poisonous toad?

1762
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,400
Even the colors of his shirt.
Poisonous animals are usually colorful.

1763
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:41,829
He's extremely poisonous.

1764
01:04:41,829 --> 01:04:42,929
(Frog84 is highly poisonous.)

1765
01:04:44,340 --> 01:04:47,469
(Frog84 memes)

1766
01:04:50,909 --> 01:04:53,780
(The ending is quite similar.)

1767
01:04:54,880 --> 01:04:57,820
(As soon as he comes out,
he checks the camera.)

1768
01:04:57,820 --> 01:04:58,880
Look at your face.

1769
01:04:59,150 --> 01:05:00,489
What is this? It's horrible.

1770
01:05:00,489 --> 01:05:02,019
- At the end.
- You looked like a goblin.

1771
01:05:02,019 --> 01:05:03,219
(The oldest one
makes them laugh unintentionally.)

1772
01:05:03,219 --> 01:05:04,389
It's horrible.

1773
01:05:04,389 --> 01:05:06,190
- I was in pain at the end.
- You looked like a goblin.

1774
01:05:07,090 --> 01:05:08,130
It's cold.

1775
01:05:08,730 --> 01:05:10,329
It was getting chilly...

1776
01:05:10,329 --> 01:05:11,900
as I stayed in the water for a long time.

1777
01:05:13,429 --> 01:05:15,030
(Moving)

1778
01:05:16,030 --> 01:05:17,739
- It's warm water. It's a hot tub.
- What is it?

1779
01:05:18,539 --> 01:05:20,309
(Temperature)

1780
01:05:20,309 --> 01:05:21,670
We should warm up in here.

1781
01:05:22,139 --> 01:05:23,809
There's even a hot tub.

1782
01:05:23,809 --> 01:05:25,179
(As soon as he found warm water,
he went into it.)

1783
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:27,710
It's so nice. It's therapeutic.

1784
01:05:27,710 --> 01:05:29,050
Just watching it feels therapeutic.

1785
01:05:30,349 --> 01:05:32,550
It's the warmest water I've felt in India.

1786
01:05:34,090 --> 01:05:36,289
(I want warm water too.)

1787
01:05:38,059 --> 01:05:39,360
I feel drowsy.

1788
01:05:39,760 --> 01:05:40,860
I think I'll pass out.

1789
01:05:42,260 --> 01:05:43,530
(The India Brothers enjoy
a truly therapeutic experience.)

1790
01:05:43,530 --> 01:05:44,559
It was nice.

1791
01:05:45,829 --> 01:05:47,469
Don't you feel like you're recovering?

1792
01:05:47,699 --> 01:05:50,670
The moment I entered this house,
I didn't feel sick at all.

1793
01:05:50,969 --> 01:05:52,699
He's fully recovered.

1794
01:05:53,210 --> 01:05:54,769
- I feel alive.
- That's true.

1795
01:05:54,769 --> 01:05:57,110
You have the same look
as the Buddha behind you.

1796
01:05:57,409 --> 01:05:59,510
- Do I?
- You're right.

1797
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:00,579
You look exactly the same.

1798
01:06:00,710 --> 01:06:02,409
I'm more merciful...

1799
01:06:02,679 --> 01:06:04,380
than when I went into the Ganges.

1800
01:06:05,150 --> 01:06:06,889
(I'm Buddha.)

1801
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:09,519
Our circumstances improved.

1802
01:06:09,519 --> 01:06:12,219
I don't know if it was just me,
but it felt different.

1803
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:15,190
I think it's true
that your mind controls your body.

1804
01:06:15,190 --> 01:06:17,159
As the circumstances improved,

1805
01:06:17,159 --> 01:06:21,170
I actually felt
that I had recovered all of a sudden.

1806
01:06:21,170 --> 01:06:23,269
People think
you need to have a hard time...

1807
01:06:23,269 --> 01:06:25,340
sweating buckets when traveling in India.

1808
01:06:25,500 --> 01:06:29,039
But as soon as we came to Delhi,
we could relax and swim.

1809
01:06:29,610 --> 01:06:31,039
Everything was perfect.

1810
01:06:31,679 --> 01:06:33,610
It's my third time in India.

1811
01:06:33,610 --> 01:06:35,079
It's completely different from my first.

1812
01:06:35,079 --> 01:06:36,150
Seriously.

1813
01:06:36,380 --> 01:06:38,150
I never even imagined...

1814
01:06:38,150 --> 01:06:40,550
that I'd experience something like this
in India before going there.

1815
01:06:40,550 --> 01:06:41,650
- Right.
- Yes.

1816
01:06:41,650 --> 01:06:42,719
(They were more thankful
for the new experience.)

1817
01:06:43,489 --> 01:06:45,190
We should start getting ready.

1818
01:06:45,659 --> 01:06:48,960
We can leave in 10 to 15 minutes.

1819
01:06:49,389 --> 01:06:50,900
I should dry my clothes before I go.

1820
01:06:51,800 --> 01:06:53,099
We wanted to arrive...

1821
01:06:53,099 --> 01:06:55,170
at the Korean restaurant when it opened.

1822
01:06:56,840 --> 01:06:59,440
(A common way to dry your clothes)

1823
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:01,139
What is he...

1824
01:07:01,139 --> 01:07:02,210
(An uncommon way to dry your clothes)

1825
01:07:02,210 --> 01:07:03,679
I've never seen a person...

1826
01:07:03,679 --> 01:07:05,039
who dries his clothes like this
in my life.

1827
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:06,650
I guess that's how you should live.

1828
01:07:07,780 --> 01:07:09,880
(Respect)

1829
01:07:10,150 --> 01:07:11,619
Are you drying your clothes?

1830
01:07:13,050 --> 01:07:14,449
There's a bee.

1831
01:07:15,690 --> 01:07:17,190
He didn't even care.

1832
01:07:18,789 --> 01:07:20,090
What an amazing guy.

1833
01:07:20,090 --> 01:07:21,789
(Shaking his head)

1834
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:24,730
(When he's dry enough,)

1835
01:07:24,730 --> 01:07:28,269
(he turns over
and dries his clothes again.)

1836
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:34,639
(His clothes are baked
under the hot sunlight.)

1837
01:07:35,269 --> 01:07:37,610
(They're back after drying their clothes.)

1838
01:07:37,610 --> 01:07:38,679
Kian84.

1839
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:40,710
Kian84.

1840
01:07:40,710 --> 01:07:42,150
You should wake up now.

1841
01:07:43,150 --> 01:07:45,320
- Your clothes look quite dry now.
- Yes. They're quite dry.

1842
01:07:46,380 --> 01:07:48,190
- Let's go eat.
- Let's go.

1843
01:07:48,190 --> 01:07:50,420
- Before we eat,
- Yes.

1844
01:07:50,420 --> 01:07:52,260
I need to buy some clothes.

1845
01:07:52,260 --> 01:07:55,159
- I saw a small market near here.
- Okay.

1846
01:07:55,159 --> 01:07:56,260
Don't you need to buy clothes?

1847
01:07:56,260 --> 01:07:58,059
I need to get conditioner.

1848
01:07:58,059 --> 01:07:59,599
- Do you need to buy anything?
- A razor.

1849
01:07:59,599 --> 01:08:01,099
It takes seven minutes on foot.

1850
01:08:01,099 --> 01:08:02,829
- Let's go there on foot.
- Okay.

1851
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:04,800
Pani Bottle usually gets what he needs...

1852
01:08:04,800 --> 01:08:06,840
- from local stores.
- Right.

1853
01:08:06,840 --> 01:08:08,369
That's also fun to do.

1854
01:08:08,369 --> 01:08:09,409
True.

1855
01:08:09,409 --> 01:08:11,440
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1856
01:08:11,809 --> 01:08:13,010
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1857
01:08:13,010 --> 01:08:14,050
(They thank them before leaving.)

1858
01:08:14,349 --> 01:08:15,849
We had a great time.

1859
01:08:16,920 --> 01:08:18,780
We fully recharged ourselves.

1860
01:08:18,780 --> 01:08:20,190
- It's a good experience.
- Yes.

1861
01:08:20,190 --> 01:08:21,889
- We regained energy after the trip.
- Yes.

1862
01:08:24,860 --> 01:08:26,989
The three of us
are traveling together now.

1863
01:08:26,989 --> 01:08:28,059
I know.

1864
01:08:28,059 --> 01:08:29,960
- It's our first time walking like this.
- It's our first time...

1865
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,599
- to walk together like this.
- You're right.

1866
01:08:31,860 --> 01:08:34,099
Right. Kian84 started by himself.

1867
01:08:36,300 --> 01:08:38,469
One became two.

1868
01:08:38,469 --> 01:08:39,840
It's like a drama.

1869
01:08:40,809 --> 01:08:42,940
(The India Brothers
finally become complete.)

1870
01:08:42,940 --> 01:08:46,039
I think three is the best number
of people to travel together.

1871
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,280
Is 3 better than 2?

1872
01:08:47,610 --> 01:08:50,150
They're selling something.
I see stores on the first floor.

1873
01:08:50,150 --> 01:08:51,320
Is it this way?

1874
01:08:51,320 --> 01:08:53,619
I think it's a market from here.

1875
01:08:54,219 --> 01:08:56,590
- There are stores here as well.
- Yes. I see stores.

1876
01:08:56,590 --> 01:08:57,860
Shall we go here?

1877
01:08:58,590 --> 01:09:01,329
We found a busy street
after walking for a while.

1878
01:09:01,329 --> 01:09:03,329
It looks clean. It's like Myeong-dong.

1879
01:09:03,329 --> 01:09:04,630
- True.
- It looks nice.

1880
01:09:05,059 --> 01:09:08,170
This is Khan Market,

1881
01:09:08,170 --> 01:09:10,139
- that's like a small Garosu-gil in India.
- Khan Market.

1882
01:09:10,139 --> 01:09:12,400
From fancy stores where you can see...

1883
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:13,940
the latest fashion trends in India...

1884
01:09:13,940 --> 01:09:15,510
to a variety of restaurants...

1885
01:09:15,510 --> 01:09:17,179
where you can enjoy
different cuisines from around the world,

1886
01:09:17,179 --> 01:09:18,539
this small market has everything.

1887
01:09:18,539 --> 01:09:21,880
As it's where rich people in India shop,

1888
01:09:21,880 --> 01:09:24,719
it has everything you need.

1889
01:09:26,380 --> 01:09:27,519
It looks like they have conditioner here.

1890
01:09:28,050 --> 01:09:29,090
Conditioner.

1891
01:09:29,090 --> 01:09:30,420
Excuse me.

1892
01:09:31,190 --> 01:09:33,659
I want some rinse.

1893
01:09:36,559 --> 01:09:39,130
(He took out something.)

1894
01:09:39,829 --> 01:09:41,829
No. Rinse.

1895
01:09:41,829 --> 01:09:43,229
- Shampoo...
- After shampoo...

1896
01:09:43,229 --> 01:09:44,399
- Shampoo?
- Treatment.

1897
01:09:44,399 --> 01:09:45,800
Treatment.

1898
01:09:45,800 --> 01:09:47,869
- No treatment?
- I think they have it here.

1899
01:09:47,869 --> 01:09:49,710
But we can't communicate.

1900
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:50,979
After shampoo.

1901
01:09:50,979 --> 01:09:52,979
Isn't it also called "rinse" in English?

1902
01:09:53,810 --> 01:09:55,409
- Is it different from conditioner?
- Conditioner?

1903
01:09:55,409 --> 01:09:57,350
- Conditioner?
- Is it rinse or...

1904
01:09:57,350 --> 01:09:58,779
- Conditioner.
- Yes.

1905
01:09:59,149 --> 01:10:00,949
- I guess it's conditioner.
- Conditioner.

1906
01:10:02,619 --> 01:10:05,289
Yes. I used to use it.

1907
01:10:05,689 --> 01:10:08,159
- I think it's right.
- "Conditioner." Okay.

1908
01:10:08,159 --> 01:10:09,689
Shave?

1909
01:10:09,689 --> 01:10:11,760
- A razor?
- Yes. A razor.

1910
01:10:11,760 --> 01:10:12,899
- A razor.
- Yes.

1911
01:10:12,899 --> 01:10:14,229
- Three, please.
- Three?

1912
01:10:14,869 --> 01:10:16,869
- It's 3 plus 1.
- It's 3 plus 1.

1913
01:10:16,869 --> 01:10:18,069
Okay.

1914
01:10:18,069 --> 01:10:19,539
You feel good when that happens.

1915
01:10:19,539 --> 01:10:20,670
It's buy 3 get 1.

1916
01:10:20,670 --> 01:10:22,810
I didn't know they do that here as well.

1917
01:10:23,109 --> 01:10:24,810
- Okay. How much is it?
- For the three items...

1918
01:10:24,810 --> 01:10:26,010
These 2 are 180 rupees.

1919
01:10:26,010 --> 01:10:27,609
Plus 60 rupees is 240 rupees in total.

1920
01:10:27,909 --> 01:10:29,180
- Okay. Thank you.
- Thank you.

1921
01:10:29,180 --> 01:10:30,420
Okay. Thank you.

1922
01:10:31,380 --> 01:10:33,020
(Looking around)

1923
01:10:33,180 --> 01:10:36,220
It's the capital,
so the stores are clean and nice.

1924
01:10:36,220 --> 01:10:37,859
We couldn't see stores like this
in Varanasi.

1925
01:10:37,859 --> 01:10:39,960
- We couldn't see anything like this.
- Stores like this...

1926
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:41,060
There's a convenience store as well.

1927
01:10:41,329 --> 01:10:42,359
- Oh, my.
- My gosh.

1928
01:10:42,359 --> 01:10:44,130
It was the first convenience store
we saw in India.

1929
01:10:45,229 --> 01:10:46,729
Shall we have some ice cream?

1930
01:10:46,729 --> 01:10:47,930
- Ice cream?
- It sounds nice.

1931
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:49,970
- They don't have popsicles.
- They have popsicles too.

1932
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:52,500
There are many kinds.

1933
01:10:52,800 --> 01:10:53,810
Okay. Hello.

1934
01:10:53,810 --> 01:10:54,939
(While the youngest one
is getting ice cream...)

1935
01:10:54,939 --> 01:10:56,170
How much is this?

1936
01:10:56,170 --> 01:10:57,579
- It's 140 rupees.
- Is there something else?

1937
01:10:57,579 --> 01:10:58,939
What was he looking for?

1938
01:10:59,880 --> 01:11:02,979
(The second eldest
checks out a store next door.)

1939
01:11:02,979 --> 01:11:04,020
What is this?

1940
01:11:04,479 --> 01:11:06,020
(He found ramyeon.)

1941
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,420
- Is it ramyeon?
- Kian84.

1942
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,720
It's Korean ramyeon.

1943
01:11:08,720 --> 01:11:10,090
(No words are needed.)

1944
01:11:10,789 --> 01:11:12,060
(Proud)

1945
01:11:12,920 --> 01:11:15,229
(He found another ramyeon immediately.)

1946
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:18,130
Kian84, they have seafood ramyeon.

1947
01:11:18,329 --> 01:11:19,329
(Let's spend money.)

1948
01:11:19,329 --> 01:11:20,399
- Shall we get it?
- Why are there so many?

1949
01:11:20,399 --> 01:11:21,930
Dex isn't familiar with Indian food.

1950
01:11:21,930 --> 01:11:23,399
- So let's get it just in case.
- Yes. We should get some.

1951
01:11:23,399 --> 01:11:25,439
- Should I ask him?
- No. Dex will eat it for sure.

1952
01:11:25,439 --> 01:11:26,539
Okay.

1953
01:11:26,539 --> 01:11:28,140
It's 1,175 rupees.

1954
01:11:28,140 --> 01:11:29,140
(1,175 rupees, about 18 dollars)

1955
01:11:29,140 --> 01:11:30,680
I think I should put this in my bag.

1956
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:32,079
Dex's bag is heavy already.

1957
01:11:32,079 --> 01:11:33,380
- Dex...
- Thank you.

1958
01:11:33,380 --> 01:11:35,550
The heavier his bag is,
the happier he gets.

1959
01:11:36,710 --> 01:11:38,579
- It's body wash, right?
- Yes.

1960
01:11:38,579 --> 01:11:39,680
Okay.

1961
01:11:40,189 --> 01:11:41,920
- Should I get mouthwash too?
- For real?

1962
01:11:42,649 --> 01:11:43,720
- "Cool mint."
- There you go.

1963
01:11:44,189 --> 01:11:45,260
Okay.

1964
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:46,930
Oh, toothpaste.

1965
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:48,359
I need to get toothpaste too. Sorry.

1966
01:11:48,359 --> 01:11:50,199
I started letting myself go.

1967
01:11:50,199 --> 01:11:51,199
You started spending money.

1968
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:54,399
I wanted to get more and more stuff.

1969
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,529
"Max fresh."

1970
01:11:56,529 --> 01:11:57,699
It has cooling flavor crystals.

1971
01:11:57,699 --> 01:11:59,500
Yes. This, please.

1972
01:12:01,510 --> 01:12:03,579
- It's an extra 450 rupees.
- Okay.

1973
01:12:03,579 --> 01:12:05,279
I can spend money on toothpaste.

1974
01:12:05,279 --> 01:12:06,310
Thank you.

1975
01:12:06,310 --> 01:12:07,310
(Three ice creams, body lotion, mouthwash,
and toothpaste, 28 dollars)

1976
01:12:07,680 --> 01:12:08,779
- Thank you.
- Thank you, sir.

1977
01:12:08,779 --> 01:12:10,680
(He's about to leave
after paying for his happiness.)

1978
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:11,720
Thank you.

1979
01:12:12,380 --> 01:12:14,319
- Can we take a photo?
- Okay.

1980
01:12:14,319 --> 01:12:16,189
Let's go. One.

1981
01:12:16,189 --> 01:12:19,359
There are always people approaching Dex.

1982
01:12:19,489 --> 01:12:20,659
(Looking)

1983
01:12:20,659 --> 01:12:21,989
- What? Is he taking a selfie?
- Yes.

1984
01:12:23,529 --> 01:12:24,600
- Did you take a selfie?
- Yes.

1985
01:12:24,600 --> 01:12:26,329
I bought things on impulse.

1986
01:12:26,329 --> 01:12:27,329
- Why did you get so many things?
- What did you buy?

1987
01:12:27,329 --> 01:12:28,800
I was just going to get some ice cream.

1988
01:12:28,800 --> 01:12:30,699
- What's this? Whiskey?
- It's mouthwash.

1989
01:12:30,699 --> 01:12:33,539
I got toothpaste and body wash.
I got a lot.

1990
01:12:34,170 --> 01:12:35,369
But when you came...

1991
01:12:35,369 --> 01:12:36,810
Can you even put these in your bag?

1992
01:12:36,810 --> 01:12:37,939
He likes it when his bag is heavy.

1993
01:12:37,939 --> 01:12:39,840
I got this ramyeon for you...

1994
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,109
as you're struggling with food.

1995
01:12:41,649 --> 01:12:42,680
This is so nice.

1996
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,350
- Well done.
- You need it.

1997
01:12:45,250 --> 01:12:47,149
- Make your choice.
- It would be delicious.

1998
01:12:47,149 --> 01:12:48,420
You pick first as you got them.

1999
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:50,289
Then you pick. I'll get the remaining one.

2000
01:12:50,590 --> 01:12:51,920
- I don't mind.
- No, you pick first.

2001
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,590
- They're all considerate.
- They're very considerate.

2002
01:12:54,789 --> 01:12:56,390
(In the end,
the eldest one chooses first.)

2003
01:12:56,390 --> 01:12:58,029
I'll have this.

2004
01:12:58,460 --> 01:12:59,699
I'll have this.

2005
01:12:59,699 --> 01:13:00,699
Oh, no.

2006
01:13:00,699 --> 01:13:01,930
He wanted to eat it.

2007
01:13:01,930 --> 01:13:03,199
He shouldn't have told me
to choose first, then.

2008
01:13:03,199 --> 01:13:04,800
He just said it.

2009
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:05,939
That happens quite a lot.

2010
01:13:05,939 --> 01:13:08,369
- He sounded very generous.
- But his look is...

2011
01:13:08,369 --> 01:13:11,010
He can't hide his emotions.

2012
01:13:11,239 --> 01:13:13,239
(To find Pani Bottle's true feelings)

2013
01:13:13,239 --> 01:13:15,350
(After scanning the ice creams,)

2014
01:13:15,850 --> 01:13:17,850
(he spoke some generous words.)

2015
01:13:18,619 --> 01:13:20,520
(But his body language was honest.)

2016
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,189
(Gulping)

2017
01:13:22,449 --> 01:13:24,689
(He stared at it fondly for a long time.)

2018
01:13:24,689 --> 01:13:26,760
- You pick first.
- I'll have this.

2019
01:13:26,760 --> 01:13:27,829
(But he lost it to Kian84.)

2020
01:13:27,829 --> 01:13:29,460
- What? Did you want this?
- Yes.

2021
01:13:29,460 --> 01:13:31,229
- Go on and take it.
- Take it.

2022
01:13:31,260 --> 01:13:33,100
Well, then, I won't refuse...

2023
01:13:33,100 --> 01:13:34,630
- since you all want me to have it.
- Okay.

2024
01:13:36,170 --> 01:13:37,439
(He takes a bite.)

2025
01:13:37,869 --> 01:13:39,569
(Delicious)

2026
01:13:39,770 --> 01:13:41,069
Gosh, this is delicious.

2027
01:13:41,069 --> 01:13:42,470
It must be so delicious
after being in the water.

2028
01:13:42,470 --> 01:13:43,470
I know.

2029
01:13:43,470 --> 01:13:45,140
(Walking around while eating ice cream...)

2030
01:13:45,939 --> 01:13:48,550
All the stores on this street
are clothing stores.

2031
01:13:48,649 --> 01:13:50,720
This place is like Myeong-dong.

2032
01:13:50,720 --> 01:13:51,750
It's hip.

2033
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:53,789
(He's looking around.)

2034
01:13:56,590 --> 01:13:58,619
- Do you have clothes for men?
- Men's style.

2035
01:13:58,619 --> 01:14:00,229
- Shirts?
- Men's shirts.

2036
01:14:01,090 --> 01:14:02,890
(Starting with a yellow shirt,)

2037
01:14:02,890 --> 01:14:04,560
- He's pulling them out right away.
- That's nice.

2038
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:05,899
(he keeps the shirts coming.)

2039
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:07,170
- Gosh.
- How many...

2040
01:14:07,170 --> 01:14:08,329
- He kept pulling them out.
- Yes.

2041
01:14:08,630 --> 01:14:10,130
This is too much linen.

2042
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:11,869
So you like linen clothes.

2043
01:14:12,670 --> 01:14:14,369
Do you have another size?

2044
01:14:14,470 --> 01:14:16,069
This is the only size. This is small.

2045
01:14:16,069 --> 01:14:17,510
I gained weight,
so I'm not sure it will fit.

2046
01:14:17,510 --> 01:14:19,239
- I think it will fit.
- This will fit.

2047
01:14:19,239 --> 01:14:20,850
Do you like this one?

2048
01:14:20,850 --> 01:14:23,619
No, it can be anything. I don't care.

2049
01:14:23,619 --> 01:14:25,279
- Then we'll pick one out for you.
- You pick for me.

2050
01:14:25,279 --> 01:14:27,090
- I think...
- Right?

2051
01:14:27,090 --> 01:14:28,449
I think this will suit him too.

2052
01:14:28,449 --> 01:14:33,289
Hey, this fits your post color.

2053
01:14:33,359 --> 01:14:34,930
- What color?
- Personal color.

2054
01:14:34,930 --> 01:14:37,430
- Personal color.
- Personal.

2055
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:39,100
Let's hold this behind your head.

2056
01:14:39,100 --> 01:14:40,600
Post color.

2057
01:14:40,600 --> 01:14:42,000
- It really...
- It suits him.

2058
01:14:42,000 --> 01:14:43,899
brightens up his face.

2059
01:14:44,369 --> 01:14:45,369
Can we try some more?

2060
01:14:45,369 --> 01:14:46,640
- Aren't you being too rough?
- This is exactly your color.

2061
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:48,609
Some more?
Okay, then, let's go one by one.

2062
01:14:48,609 --> 01:14:50,579
- We'll analyze your personal color.
- A personal color analysis in India.

2063
01:14:50,579 --> 01:14:52,310
It's not an opportunity you get every day.

2064
01:14:52,310 --> 01:14:53,979
(Gosh)

2065
01:14:54,510 --> 01:14:56,350
- Gosh.
- This washes you out.

2066
01:14:56,350 --> 01:14:57,750
The yellow one earlier was nice.

2067
01:14:57,750 --> 01:14:59,079
It completely washes your complexion out.

2068
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,750
- What about this?
- Bright ones.

2069
01:15:01,789 --> 01:15:02,789
(How do I look?)

2070
01:15:02,789 --> 01:15:04,689
- That's not bad.
- Right. Not bad.

2071
01:15:04,689 --> 01:15:05,789
(He's taking it in.)

2072
01:15:05,789 --> 01:15:07,989
No.

2073
01:15:08,090 --> 01:15:09,260
This isn't bad, either.

2074
01:15:09,260 --> 01:15:10,659
Let me see. Stand in front of it.

2075
01:15:10,659 --> 01:15:12,399
(The shirt has flamboyant patterns.)

2076
01:15:12,699 --> 01:15:14,029
(On second thought, it's not all right.)

2077
01:15:14,369 --> 01:15:16,300
Nothing's better than
the mustard-colored one so far.

2078
01:15:16,300 --> 01:15:17,439
- The mustard-colored one?
- Yes.

2079
01:15:17,439 --> 01:15:19,899
- Then I'll try it on to check the size.
- Okay.

2080
01:15:20,409 --> 01:15:21,810
He looked good in yellow.

2081
01:15:21,810 --> 01:15:22,970
(He's trying on the yellow shirt
that is receiving overwhelming approval.)

2082
01:15:23,739 --> 01:15:25,479
- Isn't it too small?
- Gosh, this is...

2083
01:15:25,479 --> 01:15:26,640
It's perfect.

2084
01:15:26,640 --> 01:15:28,079
It's not like you're going to
have it buttoned up.

2085
01:15:28,079 --> 01:15:29,180
You look really nice right now.

2086
01:15:29,180 --> 01:15:31,079
I am going to button it up.

2087
01:15:31,250 --> 01:15:32,579
(I see.)

2088
01:15:32,779 --> 01:15:33,789
Don't button it up.

2089
01:15:33,920 --> 01:15:34,949
It'll look tacky if you button it up.

2090
01:15:34,949 --> 01:15:36,149
I'm buying a shirt
because I don't have T-shirts.

2091
01:15:36,149 --> 01:15:37,460
- I see.
- I see.

2092
01:15:37,460 --> 01:15:39,359
Are these the only clothes you have?

2093
01:15:39,560 --> 01:15:41,760
- I like buying clothes when I travel.
- Right.

2094
01:15:42,229 --> 01:15:44,100
(He tries on another shirt right away.)

2095
01:15:45,560 --> 01:15:46,930
How's the size?

2096
01:15:46,930 --> 01:15:48,199
The size is okay.

2097
01:15:48,699 --> 01:15:50,069
(He's taking it in.)

2098
01:15:50,500 --> 01:15:52,069
- The size is okay.
- It's fine.

2099
01:15:52,069 --> 01:15:54,170
But why does it fit you like this?

2100
01:15:54,369 --> 01:15:57,380
- Your shoulders...
- I don't think that's his size.

2101
01:15:57,939 --> 01:15:59,710
I think the problem is his body.

2102
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,550
It keeps getting wrinkled like this.

2103
01:16:02,550 --> 01:16:03,649
That's the problem.

2104
01:16:03,979 --> 01:16:04,979
(He tried on another shirt
instead of being discouraged.)

2105
01:16:04,979 --> 01:16:06,579
He didn't look good.

2106
01:16:07,350 --> 01:16:08,720
(Kian84 is staring at Pani Bottle.)

2107
01:16:08,890 --> 01:16:11,220
- Why do they keep getting wrinkled...
- Wrinkled.

2108
01:16:11,890 --> 01:16:13,689
Hey, let's hit the gym.

2109
01:16:13,689 --> 01:16:14,930
Let's widen your shoulders.

2110
01:16:15,630 --> 01:16:16,989
If my body is the problem,
I'll just buy the shirt.

2111
01:16:16,989 --> 01:16:19,500
- There's nothing I can do about it.
- Why is this so long?

2112
01:16:19,500 --> 01:16:20,770
But it doesn't fit...

2113
01:16:20,770 --> 01:16:22,529
Indian clothes are usually long.

2114
01:16:22,529 --> 01:16:24,270
Or you can tuck it in.

2115
01:16:24,270 --> 01:16:25,869
- Like this?
- Yes.

2116
01:16:25,869 --> 01:16:28,770
- This is okay.
- This is okay.

2117
01:16:28,770 --> 01:16:30,609
- So, should I go with this one?
- This one in small. This is better.

2118
01:16:30,609 --> 01:16:32,510
To be honest, none of these are perfect.

2119
01:16:33,039 --> 01:16:34,149
But you need one.

2120
01:16:34,409 --> 01:16:35,880
Excuse me. Picture?

2121
01:16:35,880 --> 01:16:36,909
Picture? Okay.

2122
01:16:36,909 --> 01:16:38,750
- Picture. Discount.
- Discount.

2123
01:16:38,750 --> 01:16:41,289
- Gosh.
- A discount.

2124
01:16:41,720 --> 01:16:43,989
Gosh. Pani is good at this.

2125
01:16:43,989 --> 01:16:45,220
The master of bargaining.

2126
01:16:46,359 --> 01:16:48,489
- Okay. Thank you.
- Why is your shirt wet?

2127
01:16:49,029 --> 01:16:50,460
This is the beginning of the main part.

2128
01:16:51,130 --> 01:16:53,329
- I'm selling here with other people.
- Gosh.

2129
01:16:53,560 --> 01:16:54,600
It's 2,000 rupees?

2130
01:16:54,600 --> 01:16:56,800
He's giving you
a discount of 1,800 rupees.

2131
01:16:57,399 --> 01:17:00,199
- That's probably 28 dollars.
- Right, 20...

2132
01:17:00,199 --> 01:17:01,439
- It's about 28 dollars.
- Is that expensive?

2133
01:17:01,710 --> 01:17:03,670
I can't. It's too expensive.

2134
01:17:03,670 --> 01:17:05,609
- It is?
- Master.

2135
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:06,909
We'll pay 1,000 rupees.

2136
01:17:07,079 --> 01:17:08,310
Oh, my friend.

2137
01:17:08,680 --> 01:17:10,109
Let's just give him 1,500 rupees.

2138
01:17:11,079 --> 01:17:13,449
Okay.

2139
01:17:13,449 --> 01:17:17,020
Don't say okay!

2140
01:17:17,119 --> 01:17:18,359
It's fine.

2141
01:17:18,359 --> 01:17:20,529
- No.
- We didn't have time to stop him.

2142
01:17:20,529 --> 01:17:21,890
- He has to make a living too.
- But...

2143
01:17:21,890 --> 01:17:23,029
Kian84. What's...

2144
01:17:23,029 --> 01:17:24,159
(He closed his eyes tightly.)

2145
01:17:24,229 --> 01:17:25,859
Why would you say "okay?"
Did you give him the money?

2146
01:17:25,859 --> 01:17:26,899
Let's just buy it.

2147
01:17:27,029 --> 01:17:29,899
No, that's not...
This is driving me insane.

2148
01:17:29,899 --> 01:17:31,539
Why is he stuck like that?

2149
01:17:32,170 --> 01:17:34,840
Kian84. Give me the money.

2150
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:36,210
I already gave it to him.

2151
01:17:36,210 --> 01:17:37,840
Don't keep any money on you.

2152
01:17:38,010 --> 01:17:39,510
- My money?
- Give it to me.

2153
01:17:39,510 --> 01:17:40,510
I'll be using it from now on.

2154
01:17:40,510 --> 01:17:42,350
He spends money too recklessly.

2155
01:17:42,649 --> 01:17:44,180
- Here.
- What was the deal?

2156
01:17:44,180 --> 01:17:46,050
So we bought it for 21 dollars.

2157
01:17:46,050 --> 01:17:47,520
You and I should take care of this.

2158
01:17:47,520 --> 01:17:49,189
- What's wrong?
- He can't do it.

2159
01:17:49,189 --> 01:17:51,460
- He says "okay" too easily.
- I see.

2160
01:17:51,689 --> 01:17:52,819
It's automatic.

2161
01:17:53,020 --> 01:17:54,090
Okay.

2162
01:17:54,659 --> 01:17:55,890
Bye.

2163
01:17:55,890 --> 01:17:56,930
(They bought the shirt
after some twists and turns.)

2164
01:17:56,930 --> 01:17:57,930
Take care.

2165
01:17:58,800 --> 01:18:01,529
This place is a royal place, right?

2166
01:18:01,529 --> 01:18:03,430
- Yes.
- Yes, it's one of the fancy places.

2167
01:18:03,430 --> 01:18:04,640
- This is a luxury.
- A luxury.

2168
01:18:04,770 --> 01:18:06,470
- These clothes...
- It’s a white shirt.

2169
01:18:06,470 --> 01:18:09,369
- The shirt?
- This was 1,500 rupees. Is that right?

2170
01:18:09,369 --> 01:18:11,380
In the meantime, he asked the locals.

2171
01:18:11,810 --> 01:18:13,579
I think for this place, it's fine.

2172
01:18:13,579 --> 01:18:14,779
- It's good.
- It's good because...

2173
01:18:14,779 --> 01:18:16,380
- For this place...
- Not bad.

2174
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:17,949
- Okay.
- You did a good job.

2175
01:18:17,949 --> 01:18:19,319
- That's a relief.
- Right.

2176
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:21,390
(He's relieved.)

2177
01:18:21,489 --> 01:18:24,060
So Kian84 did pay the right price.

2178
01:18:24,060 --> 01:18:26,489
- Right.
- Right. I'm not clueless.

2179
01:18:26,489 --> 01:18:28,159
The price depends on the area.

2180
01:18:28,630 --> 01:18:30,560
- Okay. Let's go eat.
- Let's eat.

2181
01:18:30,560 --> 01:18:32,260
- Okay.
- You're going to eat now.

2182
01:18:32,260 --> 01:18:34,100
- I was so excited.
- I'm hungry.

2183
01:18:37,029 --> 01:18:39,000
- Where is it?
- I'm hungry.

2184
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:41,869
Gosh. Korean...

2185
01:18:41,869 --> 01:18:43,239
- BBQ.
- What's the name of the place?

2186
01:18:43,439 --> 01:18:45,010
- Is it this one? Korean BBQ.
- Yes.

2187
01:18:45,680 --> 01:18:47,510
This place was the best.

2188
01:18:47,510 --> 01:18:48,579
- Korean food is the best.
- Yes.

2189
01:18:48,810 --> 01:18:50,050
Korean BBQ.

2190
01:18:50,550 --> 01:18:52,449
- Korean food in India.
- I'm so excited.

2191
01:18:52,449 --> 01:18:53,819
I'm so curious.

2192
01:18:54,390 --> 01:18:56,189
- Hello.
- Hello.

2193
01:18:56,890 --> 01:18:58,489
It smells amazing.

2194
01:18:58,960 --> 01:19:01,689
- Gosh, it's nice.
- It's really nice.

2195
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,859
I didn't think I'd get to smell
Korean food in India.

2196
01:19:04,060 --> 01:19:05,960
Dex, they have kimchi jjigae here.
Your favorite.

2197
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,569
- Gosh.
- They have everything here.

2198
01:19:07,670 --> 01:19:10,270
I can't believe they have Kimchi jjigae.

2199
01:19:10,569 --> 01:19:11,770
Ma'am.

2200
01:19:12,569 --> 01:19:14,609
I automatically said "ma'am" in Korean.

2201
01:19:14,939 --> 01:19:16,369
(Laughing)

2202
01:19:16,840 --> 01:19:18,640
Excuse me.

2203
01:19:18,640 --> 01:19:21,579
- One hot pot bulgogi.
- One hot pot bulgogi.

2204
01:19:21,579 --> 01:19:24,720
- And three pork belly.
- Kimchi jjigae.

2205
01:19:24,720 --> 01:19:26,949
And one kimchi jjigae.

2206
01:19:26,949 --> 01:19:28,220
- That sounds awesome.
- Thank you.

2207
01:19:28,220 --> 01:19:29,390
Thank you.

2208
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:31,520
- She looks like she's Korean.
- Right.

2209
01:19:31,659 --> 01:19:33,590
- I thought she was Korean.
- Right?

2210
01:19:33,590 --> 01:19:34,829
But...

2211
01:19:34,829 --> 01:19:37,130
people from Nepal and Tibet...

2212
01:19:37,130 --> 01:19:38,800
Do they look similar to us?

2213
01:19:38,800 --> 01:19:39,800
They're almost identical to us.

2214
01:19:39,800 --> 01:19:41,770
The Himalayas extend over India too.

2215
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:44,369
People who live there are
either from Tibet...

2216
01:19:44,439 --> 01:19:45,800
or Bhutan.

2217
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:47,939
I wonder how cold it is in the Himalayas.

2218
01:19:48,210 --> 01:19:49,270
Do you want to go to the Himalayas?

2219
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:51,180
You said you wanted to go.

2220
01:19:51,180 --> 01:19:53,310
What I wanted to do the most in India...

2221
01:19:53,310 --> 01:19:54,750
was visiting the Himalayas.

2222
01:19:54,750 --> 01:19:56,810
I want to see the Himalayas
with my own eyes.

2223
01:19:57,180 --> 01:19:59,050
(Before they left for India)

2224
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,649
I want to go to the most amazing place...

2225
01:20:02,890 --> 01:20:05,689
and soak in the feeling
while looking at it.

2226
01:20:06,359 --> 01:20:09,729
I dreamed of feeling the arms
of Mother Nature.

2227
01:20:09,729 --> 01:20:10,829
- Gosh.
- It's amazing.

2228
01:20:11,859 --> 01:20:13,760
I wanted to see the Himalayas.

2229
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,699
I wanted to capture it with my eyes.

2230
01:20:16,569 --> 01:20:18,539
If it's possible,
we could borrow equipment...

2231
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:20,539
and hike until the sun sets.

2232
01:20:20,539 --> 01:20:22,310
We would stop there and put up a tent.

2233
01:20:22,310 --> 01:20:24,039
The three of us putting up
a tent would be fun.

2234
01:20:24,039 --> 01:20:25,939
We'd put up a tent, stay for a night,

2235
01:20:25,939 --> 01:20:27,579
and we'd come back down the next morning.

2236
01:20:27,579 --> 01:20:29,109
Sounds good.

2237
01:20:29,109 --> 01:20:31,720
While we crossed borders in South America,

2238
01:20:31,720 --> 01:20:33,779
traveling in India felt like
we were going abroad...

2239
01:20:33,779 --> 01:20:35,649
within one country.

2240
01:20:35,649 --> 01:20:36,689
(Traveling in India felt like they were
going abroad within one country.)

2241
01:20:36,689 --> 01:20:38,619
(It's really Mother Nature from here.)

2242
01:20:39,619 --> 01:20:41,430
(The beautiful view seems like
it's CGI scenery.)

2243
01:20:41,430 --> 01:20:42,930
This place is so beautiful.

2244
01:20:43,159 --> 01:20:46,100
My dream will come true soon.

2245
01:20:46,100 --> 01:20:47,199
(He'll soon face the moment
when his dream comes true.)

2246
01:20:47,770 --> 01:20:49,329
(But dreams only last for a moment.
Gosh, I'm dizzy.)

2247
01:20:49,670 --> 01:20:51,770
(Dex, I thought this was supposed to be
a therapeutic trip in the Himalayas.)

2248
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,170
(Doesn't this feel therapeutic right now?)

2249
01:20:53,369 --> 01:20:55,069
(Meanwhile, the older two seem like
they lost their senses.)

2250
01:20:55,069 --> 01:20:56,109
(He's in a daze.)

2251
01:20:56,210 --> 01:20:59,239
(Somewhere between dream and reality,)

2252
01:20:59,609 --> 01:21:00,880
(all sentimentality is lost,
and only survival remains.)

2253
01:21:00,880 --> 01:21:03,210
(Camping in the Himalayas, coming soon)

2254
01:21:03,409 --> 01:21:06,319
Pani Bottle said he had never been
to the Himalayas in India.

2255
01:21:06,319 --> 01:21:09,789
So I thought it would be nice for us to go
where none of us had been before.

2256
01:21:10,119 --> 01:21:13,060
What's next on the agenda for us?
After New Delhi.

2257
01:21:13,659 --> 01:21:15,289
- After New Delhi?
- Yes. Do you have any plans?

2258
01:21:16,329 --> 01:21:18,800
To be honest, we don't even know
what we'll be doing this evening.

2259
01:21:18,899 --> 01:21:21,800
We already have a last destination,

2260
01:21:21,800 --> 01:21:23,729
but we don't have anything before that.

2261
01:21:23,829 --> 01:21:26,600
There's this place I've been to before
that was very fun.

2262
01:21:26,600 --> 01:21:28,470
- Where is it?
- It's called Amritsar.

2263
01:21:28,470 --> 01:21:30,470
It's in a state called Punjab,

2264
01:21:30,470 --> 01:21:32,180
which is northwest of here.

2265
01:21:32,180 --> 01:21:34,850
You know how there are some Indians
who wear turbans?

2266
01:21:34,850 --> 01:21:37,180
The people who wear turbans are Sikhs.

2267
01:21:37,180 --> 01:21:39,779
- They're Sikhs?
- Yes. Their religion is called Sikhism.

2268
01:21:40,050 --> 01:21:41,649
If you go to their temple,

2269
01:21:41,649 --> 01:21:43,689
- they give you free food.
- That's nice.

2270
01:21:43,689 --> 01:21:44,819
(Free food)

2271
01:21:44,819 --> 01:21:46,920
They let you stay for free.
They provide you with everything.

2272
01:21:46,920 --> 01:21:47,960
- It's like a temple stay program.
- Right.

2273
01:21:47,960 --> 01:21:50,130
It sounds like a temple stay experience.

2274
01:21:50,130 --> 01:21:51,300
Let's go there.

2275
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:52,699
It's really nice there. You'll like it.

2276
01:21:52,699 --> 01:21:53,699
It sounds fun.

2277
01:21:55,170 --> 01:21:57,770
(The golden temple
of equality and tolerance)

2278
01:21:57,970 --> 01:22:01,340
It's amazing
how the temple is open for free.

2279
01:22:01,670 --> 01:22:02,909
(Work for it.)

2280
01:22:02,909 --> 01:22:05,510
- What's going on?
- What?

2281
01:22:05,680 --> 01:22:07,649
(They'll be getting
the full experience of the temple.)

2282
01:22:08,380 --> 01:22:11,449
(New Delhi to Amritsar)

2283
01:22:11,579 --> 01:22:13,550
(Amritsar to the Himalayas)

2284
01:22:13,550 --> 01:22:16,449
(Thanks to Pani Bottle, their next plans
have been settled smoothly.)

2285
01:22:16,720 --> 01:22:19,920
I feel like today is the last luxury
we'll get to enjoy.

2286
01:22:19,920 --> 01:22:20,989
- Right.
- Yes.

2287
01:22:21,890 --> 01:22:23,229
(He cleared up the space
where the pork will be grilled.)

2288
01:22:23,229 --> 01:22:24,329
Thank you.

2289
01:22:25,100 --> 01:22:26,100
(Dex's eyes are fixed.)

2290
01:22:26,760 --> 01:22:28,000
The pork belly is finally here.

2291
01:22:28,399 --> 01:22:29,430
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

2292
01:22:29,430 --> 01:22:31,569
You probably didn't even get to
look at meat so far.

2293
01:22:31,569 --> 01:22:33,600
I was so happy to see that pork belly.

2294
01:22:34,239 --> 01:22:35,539
The pork belly looks great.

2295
01:22:35,810 --> 01:22:37,439
(The pork belly has arrived.)

2296
01:22:37,739 --> 01:22:39,710
- Gosh, the garlic.
- The ssamjang.

2297
01:22:40,680 --> 01:22:43,079
(He hurriedly grills pork belly
on the heated pan.)

2298
01:22:46,520 --> 01:22:47,520
(Hurry up and cook.)

2299
01:22:47,520 --> 01:22:48,590
Gosh, this is going to be good.

2300
01:22:48,750 --> 01:22:50,689
Dex will be enjoying himself.

2301
01:22:50,989 --> 01:22:52,819
- Oh, my gosh.
- That's right.

2302
01:22:53,220 --> 01:22:54,359
A handful of garlic.

2303
01:22:55,789 --> 01:22:58,529
- Thank you for the food.
- Eat up.

2304
01:22:58,600 --> 01:22:59,659
(He has a bite.)

2305
01:23:00,029 --> 01:23:01,069
(Gosh)

2306
01:23:01,069 --> 01:23:02,829
(He puts a piece of pork belly
into his mouth without hesitation.)

2307
01:23:04,300 --> 01:23:05,840
(He takes a huge bite.)

2308
01:23:06,600 --> 01:23:07,739
(Mouthwatering)

2309
01:23:07,739 --> 01:23:09,210
(Lots of pork, garlic, and a big scoop
of ssamjang wrapped in lettuce)

2310
01:23:09,210 --> 01:23:10,340
That's great.

2311
01:23:10,340 --> 01:23:13,039
That's the most delicious way
to eat pork belly in India.

2312
01:23:14,109 --> 01:23:17,109
I thought
Indians didn't eat a lot of meat,

2313
01:23:17,109 --> 01:23:19,319
but there were a lot of locals
at that Korean restaurant.

2314
01:23:21,289 --> 01:23:22,890
(Golden brown)

2315
01:23:23,920 --> 01:23:25,989
Thank you. Gosh. It looks good.

2316
01:23:27,359 --> 01:23:28,359
(Slurping)

2317
01:23:28,729 --> 01:23:30,560
(You can't miss out on
the bulgogi and kimchi jjigae.)

2318
01:23:30,560 --> 01:23:31,600
Look at the color.

2319
01:23:33,100 --> 01:23:34,100
(Slurping)

2320
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:35,430
(Exclaiming)

2321
01:23:35,770 --> 01:23:37,939
(The younger one
tries a sip of the jjigae like Kian84.)

2322
01:23:39,199 --> 01:23:40,699
(The taste of home makes him
furrow his brows in delight.)

2323
01:23:41,810 --> 01:23:42,840
(Eating)

2324
01:23:45,010 --> 01:23:46,810
(He sticks out his tongue
and wraps the bulgogi up.)

2325
01:23:47,140 --> 01:23:49,109
(He dips it in the sauce...)

2326
01:23:50,050 --> 01:23:51,649
(and puts it in his mouth.)

2327
01:23:52,850 --> 01:23:53,850
(Satisfied)

2328
01:23:54,550 --> 01:23:56,890
(The pork belly disappears in no time.)

2329
01:23:57,189 --> 01:23:59,359
Everyone was quiet while eating.

2330
01:23:59,359 --> 01:24:00,390
We just ate.

2331
01:24:01,460 --> 01:24:03,359
(They were recharged
by the tastes of homestyle cooking.)

2332
01:24:03,359 --> 01:24:06,460
I was half knocked out on the train.

2333
01:24:06,460 --> 01:24:08,229
Then I recovered in Delhi.

2334
01:24:08,229 --> 01:24:10,630
Watching us enjoying ourselves
in the luxurious house...

2335
01:24:10,630 --> 01:24:12,539
- and recovering,
- Yes.

2336
01:24:12,739 --> 01:24:14,770
I feel like we showed you two extremes.

2337
01:24:14,770 --> 01:24:15,770
I see.

2338
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:20,739
Those images look beautiful to me.

2339
01:24:21,050 --> 01:24:22,779
Those images look beautiful to me.

2340
01:24:22,779 --> 01:24:23,979
(Out of the blue?)

2341
01:24:23,979 --> 01:24:25,949
I'm sad that such beautiful moments
in my life...

2342
01:24:27,649 --> 01:24:30,289
have passed by again.

2343
01:24:30,289 --> 01:24:31,619
("I'm sad that those moments
have passed by again.")

2344
01:24:33,659 --> 01:24:35,560
(From Varanasi...)

2345
01:24:35,560 --> 01:24:37,760
(to Delhi,)

2346
01:24:37,760 --> 01:24:40,600
(good memories flooded back.)

2347
01:24:41,699 --> 01:24:43,899
(Sensitivity84 suddenly got emotional.)

2348
01:24:44,539 --> 01:24:46,770
- You got a little emotional.
- Do you feel like crying?

2349
01:24:46,770 --> 01:24:48,010
No, I don't.

2350
01:24:48,010 --> 01:24:49,239
I had a tooth extracted yesterday.

2351
01:24:49,239 --> 01:24:50,979
My condition isn't all that great.

2352
01:24:51,539 --> 01:24:52,579
(Brother)

2353
01:24:52,579 --> 01:24:54,949
It was the last luxury we had.

2354
01:24:54,949 --> 01:24:55,949
Really?

2355
01:24:55,949 --> 01:24:57,750
- You faced hardships again after that.
- You faced hardships again...

2356
01:24:57,750 --> 01:24:58,750
- after that.
- We struggled again.

2357
01:24:58,750 --> 01:25:00,319
What's funny...

2358
01:25:00,319 --> 01:25:03,390
is that you need a nice balance
of good and bad.

2359
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:05,420
- But it kept getting harder.
- It did?

2360
01:25:05,420 --> 01:25:06,819
- At the end...
- For real?

2361
01:25:06,819 --> 01:25:07,989
For real.

2362
01:25:07,989 --> 01:25:10,060
- I thought...
- Did it keep getting harder after this?

2363
01:25:10,060 --> 01:25:11,529
I felt like dying.

2364
01:25:11,729 --> 01:25:13,229
The guys ran away in the middle.

2365
01:25:13,229 --> 01:25:14,270
I was left alone.

2366
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,529
- You ran away?
- Seriously?

2367
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:17,939
Both of them ran away.

2368
01:25:17,939 --> 01:25:19,439
Even the former UDT soldier ran away.

2369
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:21,010
Worse things than what you've seen so far
happened later.

2370
01:25:23,569 --> 01:25:24,579
I'm full.

2371
01:25:24,579 --> 01:25:25,710
(They're completely recharged
after a taste of home.)

2372
01:25:25,710 --> 01:25:27,079
Let's finish the last glass and go.

2373
01:25:27,539 --> 01:25:29,550
(They had the best
and the worst times today.)

2374
01:25:31,750 --> 01:25:34,619
(It's clear that the Indian Brothers
will suffer hardships from now on.)

2375
01:25:35,449 --> 01:25:37,619
(They're excited
about the next destination.)

2376
01:25:39,060 --> 01:25:41,729
(The third city
that greets them with new vibes)

2377
01:25:42,090 --> 01:25:43,789
(The sacred place of Sikhism)

2378
01:25:43,789 --> 01:25:46,399
(Amritsar)

2379
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,500
(What is this place?)

2380
01:25:48,729 --> 01:25:50,869
(Why is everyone sleeping?)

2381
01:25:51,470 --> 01:25:52,939
(It's like a Korean sauna.)

2382
01:25:53,369 --> 01:25:54,609
(Let's get some boxes.)

2383
01:25:55,039 --> 01:25:56,909
(Are they going to join them
and sleep outside in Korean style?)

2384
01:25:57,810 --> 01:26:01,250
(Amritsar looks different
from other places they've visited so far.)

2385
01:26:01,409 --> 01:26:02,850
(He looks good even with a turban.)

2386
01:26:03,310 --> 01:26:04,949
(Meanwhile, there's Dumpling Pani...)

2387
01:26:04,949 --> 01:26:07,079
(and Farmer84.)

2388
01:26:07,619 --> 01:26:09,520
(The Indian Brothers
fully embraced Sikhism.)

2389
01:26:10,420 --> 01:26:13,119
(They enter a golden temple
after fully dressing up.)

2390
01:26:13,760 --> 01:26:15,689
(A cafeteria in the golden temple...)

2391
01:26:15,689 --> 01:26:18,060
(that gets up to 100,000 visitors)

2392
01:26:18,699 --> 01:26:20,970
(The food is coming!)

2393
01:26:21,800 --> 01:26:23,529
(This is delicious.)

2394
01:26:23,829 --> 01:26:26,140
(Happy)

2395
01:26:26,500 --> 01:26:29,210
(The record of their travels in Amritsar
where they were satisfied 100 percent)
