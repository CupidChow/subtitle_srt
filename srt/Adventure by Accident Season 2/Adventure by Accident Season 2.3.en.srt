1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:02,610
Until last week,
we greeted you in Pani Bottle's house...

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:04,380
without him here.

3
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:06,140
Finally, the owner of the house is back.

4
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:07,350
- Pani Bottle!
- Hello.

5
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,050
(The owner of the house,
Pani Bottle, is finally back.)

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,349
(In Pani Bottle's house
without Pani Bottle)

7
00:00:11,980 --> 00:00:13,919
(They basically filmed "Parasite"
for the past 2 weeks.)

8
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:16,660
(The owner of the house was locked up.)

9
00:00:17,389 --> 00:00:18,889
You guys did well without me.

10
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,029
- Pani Bottle has gotten more handsome...
- Yes?

11
00:00:22,029 --> 00:00:23,829
since Season One.

12
00:00:23,829 --> 00:00:25,799
- He has gotten more handsome.
- He's becoming a celebrity.

13
00:00:25,799 --> 00:00:27,270
He did become a celebrity.

14
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:28,770
He was even in a commercial.

15
00:00:28,770 --> 00:00:31,000
The commercial and everything
were all thanks to Adventure by Accident.

16
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,040
When I go to the airport,
they don't know my name,

17
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:35,369
but they say, "That is Kian84's friend."

18
00:00:35,369 --> 00:00:36,680
- Really?
- Oh, my.

19
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,280
- "Kian84's friend."
- Gosh.

20
00:00:38,839 --> 00:00:40,009
(Pani Bottle, the popular new celebrity,
in the airport)

21
00:00:40,009 --> 00:00:41,379
We should get a picture.

22
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:43,619
- Kian84! I really enjoyed that.
- This is crazy.

23
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:46,449
- Oh, yes.
- I don't know his name. Kian84's friend.

24
00:00:46,449 --> 00:00:47,490
(I don't know his name. Kian84's friend)

25
00:00:47,549 --> 00:00:49,990
- Oh, my.
- Yes. They really all recognize me.

26
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:52,019
You even talk like a celebrity now.

27
00:00:53,019 --> 00:00:55,759
- He's famous now.
- He's a total entertainer now.

28
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,129
(Kian84's friend, 37 years old,
professional entertainer)

29
00:00:57,129 --> 00:00:59,829
Your YouTube channel became famous...

30
00:00:59,829 --> 00:01:02,530
- with your India trip, right?
- Right.

31
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:03,540
- Yes.
- Right.

32
00:01:03,540 --> 00:01:06,070
How did you feel when you heard
about the India trip for Season Two?

33
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:08,270
This is my third time going there now.

34
00:01:08,270 --> 00:01:10,210
I thought I'd have to lead...

35
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:13,479
- because I was a bit more familiar.
- You are a bit more familiar.

36
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:14,710
I don't know whether I did well.

37
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:17,449
- I don't know much.
- Gosh. What are you talking about?

38
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:19,380
- You also said so last time.
- But I really don't know much.

39
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,820
- That's not true.
- He didn't know India very well.

40
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:25,960
But people told me...

41
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,690
that travel YouTubers should be nervous.

42
00:01:28,130 --> 00:01:31,330
You need to do as much as Kian84
to say you went to India.

43
00:01:31,330 --> 00:01:32,930
- A lot of people said that.
- Really?

44
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:35,130
Kian84 is really a gem
in the broadcasting industry.

45
00:01:35,669 --> 00:01:37,999
(Feeling shy)

46
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,009
Mother Ganga is waiting for us.

47
00:03:15,009 --> 00:03:16,039
Yes.

48
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,479
Can you see it?

49
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:19,449
(Mother, I brought Dex.)

50
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:21,850
(Welcome!)

51
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:23,949
Let's go. Why don't we take a swim?

52
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,319
Let's go.

53
00:03:26,089 --> 00:03:27,890
So naturally like that.

54
00:03:28,419 --> 00:03:30,860
- I wanted to go in at least once.
- Right.

55
00:03:32,059 --> 00:03:34,390
Gosh!

56
00:03:35,100 --> 00:03:37,729
(The first son takes tiny steps
to go meet Mother Ganga.)

57
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,300
(Stepping)

58
00:03:45,569 --> 00:03:46,810
A frilled-neck lizard!

59
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,280
(Frilled-neck lizard)

60
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,509
(Diving into Mother Ganga)

61
00:03:51,509 --> 00:03:53,680
He seems more Indian
than the actual Indians.

62
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:58,280
(This is Dex's first time
diving into the Ganges.)

63
00:03:59,389 --> 00:04:01,750
(Stepping forward carefully)

64
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:05,759
(The start and end of India...)

65
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:10,060
(lies with the majestic Mother Ganga.)

66
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:14,829
(Mother.)

67
00:04:14,829 --> 00:04:17,269
- Why do you look so cool walking in?
- Hey!

68
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,539
(What is this?)

69
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:21,310
- You're acting too cool.
- Yes.

70
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,310
- What were you doing just there?
- Hey.

71
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:26,280
- A ritual.
- What ritual?

72
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,910
- What is that?
- Are you religious?

73
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:29,419
Hey. You don't have a religion.

74
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:30,850
(Exploding with jealousy)

75
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:33,250
Someone went in
looking like a frilled-neck lizard.

76
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:34,289
- Hey.
- Hey. What are you doing?

77
00:04:34,289 --> 00:04:36,259
He did this.

78
00:04:36,389 --> 00:04:39,259
- I did that to show a lot of respect.
- I see.

79
00:04:39,259 --> 00:04:40,729
You look like a statue.

80
00:04:40,729 --> 00:04:41,829
Seriously.

81
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,699
You look like a statue.

82
00:04:45,329 --> 00:04:51,139
(Walking into Mother Ganges' arms
with respect)

83
00:04:54,269 --> 00:04:55,410
(Going all the way in the water)

84
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:57,579
- You're going in like that?
- Oh, my.

85
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,150
(Shaking his hair)

86
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:07,419
(Diving fully in one more time)

87
00:05:07,419 --> 00:05:09,759
You basically shot a commercial there.

88
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,220
How was the water?

89
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,530
The temperature was just right.

90
00:05:14,130 --> 00:05:15,829
The temperature was perfect.

91
00:05:20,130 --> 00:05:21,229
I feel...

92
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,900
Does it feel
like your sins are being washed away?

93
00:05:25,239 --> 00:05:26,910
My mind is relaxed.

94
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,609
I felt a bit weird while walking in.

95
00:05:32,609 --> 00:05:34,810
As I was walking in,
I thought about a lot of things.

96
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,819
I thought of the people
I loved and valued.

97
00:05:37,819 --> 00:05:40,319
I thought of the sins
they may have committed.

98
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:43,819
I also thought about my own sins.

99
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:47,460
I thought
about washing all of that away here.

100
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:50,260
That's why I wanted
to dive all the way in.

101
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:52,499
(He naturally dove all the way in
to wash everything away.)

102
00:05:53,799 --> 00:05:58,669
(While Dex takes time for repentance...)

103
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:00,970
(An extraordinary sight)

104
00:06:00,970 --> 00:06:02,080
Gosh. Stop it.

105
00:06:04,109 --> 00:06:05,309
(They're both enjoying the Ganges
in their own way.)

106
00:06:05,309 --> 00:06:06,679
Can you swim at all, Kian84?

107
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,080
I can swim a little.

108
00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,419
(Splashing)

109
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,749
(What?)

110
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:16,919
(Indian boys are splashing the water
to get their attention.)

111
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,359
Swimming together?

112
00:06:19,359 --> 00:06:21,559
- Sure.
- Swimming.

113
00:06:21,559 --> 00:06:23,129
- It's a battle.
- A race.

114
00:06:23,129 --> 00:06:25,129
- What's best?
- No.

115
00:06:25,129 --> 00:06:27,530
- He's the best.
- Who? He's the best?

116
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,169
- He's the best.
- The best.

117
00:06:29,169 --> 00:06:30,270
He's good.

118
00:06:30,439 --> 00:06:31,700
Give it a go.

119
00:06:32,439 --> 00:06:34,340
- If you lose again this time.
- Hello.

120
00:06:34,869 --> 00:06:36,710
- Dex was in UDT.
- Gosh.

121
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:38,539
- His swimming must be...
- He must be an expert at swimming.

122
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:39,650
He's the best.

123
00:06:41,150 --> 00:06:42,619
- Look at him.
- He has such intense eyes.

124
00:06:42,619 --> 00:06:45,020
He looks
like he lived his whole life in a pool.

125
00:06:46,189 --> 00:06:48,350
- I'll be the finishing line.
- Okay.

126
00:06:48,619 --> 00:06:51,559
(Whoever gets to Kian84 first wins.)

127
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:52,989
Start. Finish.

128
00:06:52,989 --> 00:06:54,890
(Starting line, finishing line)

129
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:56,600
- Are you the best swimmer?
- Yes.

130
00:06:57,359 --> 00:06:59,299
(That's correct.)

131
00:06:59,299 --> 00:07:00,900
(This won't be easy.)

132
00:07:01,470 --> 00:07:02,640
Hey. Please do well this time.

133
00:07:02,939 --> 00:07:04,539
(You know what I'm saying, right?)

134
00:07:05,239 --> 00:07:06,869
(Representing the Republic of Korea
Navy Special Warfare Flotilla)

135
00:07:07,270 --> 00:07:09,410
- Okay.
- He's not just a kid. He's very...

136
00:07:10,580 --> 00:07:12,580
(Korea and India's honor
rests in our hands!)

137
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:15,479
Okay!

138
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:17,049
(The race begins.)

139
00:07:18,450 --> 00:07:21,090
(Dex)

140
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,720
- Dex was faster.
- Oh, look. He's fast.

141
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:24,890
(Dex takes the lead
as soon as they start.)

142
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,289
His eyes are open. What is that?

143
00:07:28,760 --> 00:07:30,600
(Oh, my goodness)

144
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:32,570
- I'm scared!
- I'm so scared.

145
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:34,200
- That's scary.
- You look like you'll kill Kian84.

146
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:38,600
I get so serious whenever I start to race.

147
00:07:39,869 --> 00:07:43,140
(The distance between them grows quickly.)

148
00:07:44,109 --> 00:07:45,109
Oh, my.

149
00:07:45,109 --> 00:07:47,979
- Oh, my. You're so good.
- He could swim so quickly.

150
00:07:47,979 --> 00:07:48,979
Gosh.

151
00:07:49,650 --> 00:07:52,189
(The Indian boy doesn't give up
until the end.)

152
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:53,450
We won.

153
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,249
- Good.
- Good.

154
00:07:55,689 --> 00:07:57,960
(A nice and respectful race)

155
00:07:58,590 --> 00:08:00,460
(The atmosphere was nice.)

156
00:08:00,460 --> 00:08:02,260
Let's race until that point.

157
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,629
They're going to race.

158
00:08:04,629 --> 00:08:05,900
Are you going to race each other?

159
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,200
I didn't want to lose.

160
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,739
I also didn't plan on losing at all.

161
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:13,309
(An unyielding race)

162
00:08:13,309 --> 00:08:14,570
Ready. Go!

163
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:16,739
(Start)

164
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:18,280
(Dex, Kian84)

165
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,679
- Oh, my.
- He's good. He's fast. Neck and neck.

166
00:08:21,410 --> 00:08:26,289
(They didn't expect such a close race.)

167
00:08:27,189 --> 00:08:29,820
(Who will be the winner?)

168
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:33,559
(Racing as if they're
in the Olympic finals)

169
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,700
(Neck and neck)

170
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:39,470
(Dex shoots forward.)

171
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,700
Dex got past Kian84.

172
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:43,900
(Dex gets ahead of Kian84 and wins.)

173
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:44,999
You're good.

174
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:48,369
I was thinking of taking it easy at first.

175
00:08:48,369 --> 00:08:49,609
I was surprised
and started going full-speed.

176
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:50,910
- He was so good.
- Kian84 had a faster start.

177
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:53,580
I was trying to recover
from my pride getting hurt earlier.

178
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:56,280
Why are you recovering by beating me?

179
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,450
I need a place to take out my anger.

180
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:05,460
(He didn't even get to take out his anger,
and he's exhausted.)

181
00:09:07,189 --> 00:09:08,799
- I prayed a bit.
- You prayed?

182
00:09:08,929 --> 00:09:09,929
Yes.

183
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:12,200
- I feel so much better.
- Look at their eyes.

184
00:09:12,999 --> 00:09:14,030
Hello.

185
00:09:15,369 --> 00:09:17,340
(He looks cool even when he's standing.)

186
00:09:17,669 --> 00:09:19,239
- Hello.
- Oh, my.

187
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:20,439
(Following Dex
and putting his hand on his waist)

188
00:09:20,439 --> 00:09:21,439
Cute!

189
00:09:21,439 --> 00:09:22,739
- He's copying you.
- Are you showing off your charms?

190
00:09:22,739 --> 00:09:24,140
Cute!

191
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,580
A picture? Okay.

192
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:27,580
(A picture?)

193
00:09:27,780 --> 00:09:29,780
(Once Dex goes with them
to take a picture...)

194
00:09:30,080 --> 00:09:31,720
(Left alone)

195
00:09:31,720 --> 00:09:33,419
Why aren't they asking me for a picture?

196
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,489
He's sad again.

197
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,929
Dex really is popular.

198
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,530
(Running out in the middle of a swim)

199
00:09:44,030 --> 00:09:46,929
(Everyone crowding around him)

200
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,429
We swam together,

201
00:09:49,369 --> 00:09:50,900
but they're not asking me for a picture.

202
00:09:53,239 --> 00:09:54,239
Punks.

203
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,140
(I want a picture too.)

204
00:09:58,109 --> 00:09:59,749
(Oh, my. It's Dex.)

205
00:09:59,749 --> 00:10:01,749
- "Oh, my. It's Dex." What is that?
- He went right past you.

206
00:10:02,450 --> 00:10:04,249
They must've been fans
of "Single's Inferno."

207
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:08,550
(Heartbreaking loneliness)

208
00:10:10,119 --> 00:10:11,820
- He's so popular.
- He has a lot of fans.

209
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:13,930
(Wherever he goes,
it turns into a fan-meet.)

210
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:15,729
You took so many pictures.

211
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:18,659
(The son of MBC is being threatened...)

212
00:10:18,659 --> 00:10:20,670
(by the youngest son of MBC.)

213
00:10:21,369 --> 00:10:24,040
- Kian84's looking so small.
- His facial expression.

214
00:10:25,300 --> 00:10:27,269
(Lonely)

215
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,840
Yes.

216
00:10:30,710 --> 00:10:32,249
Now that Dex is here,

217
00:10:33,550 --> 00:10:34,950
I'm not lonely anymore. It's fun.

218
00:10:34,950 --> 00:10:36,680
Traveling in a group is more fun...

219
00:10:36,979 --> 00:10:39,119
than traveling alone.

220
00:10:39,119 --> 00:10:40,389
- You don't look like it.
- You don't look like you mean it.

221
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:42,759
- Did you actually mean it?
- By your facial expression, you look sad.

222
00:10:42,759 --> 00:10:44,090
(Where is your sincerity?)

223
00:10:45,489 --> 00:10:46,560
(Taking care of his fans)

224
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,690
Look at that.

225
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,159
You're kind.

226
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:51,060
Okay. Bless you.

227
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:52,869
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

228
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:55,070
(The fan-meet ends successfully.)

229
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:56,769
Gosh. Look at his body.

230
00:10:56,769 --> 00:10:59,139
(Gosh. Look at his body.)

231
00:10:59,340 --> 00:11:00,540
How sexy.

232
00:11:01,210 --> 00:11:02,409
- Sexy.
- Seriously.

233
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,540
I feel so much better
after getting in the water.

234
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,180
- Are you happy?
- I felt so down over there.

235
00:11:09,350 --> 00:11:10,379
Oh, he's good.

236
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:12,889
I don't know which body is which.

237
00:11:12,889 --> 00:11:14,749
- Seriously.
- You're like this, right?

238
00:11:15,249 --> 00:11:17,090
Which shorts are yours, Dex?

239
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:18,460
A ghost.

240
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:20,060
It's like a ghost picture.

241
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,029
- He's the one on the bottom.
- Right. There he is.

242
00:11:22,029 --> 00:11:23,899
- His face is there.
- Oh, there he is.

243
00:11:23,899 --> 00:11:25,499
(Dex is the one in the black shorts.)

244
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:27,269
Why are you so sexy?

245
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:28,940
I'm naturally kind of sexy.

246
00:11:28,940 --> 00:11:31,300
(I'm naturally kind of sexy.)

247
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:34,170
When he was walking toward me
after swimming,

248
00:11:34,340 --> 00:11:35,580
he was sexy.

249
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,340
He has a lot of hair.

250
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:38,950
His muscles are big.

251
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,879
His face too.

252
00:11:41,479 --> 00:11:45,119
He has a nice jawline,
and his nose sticks out like that.

253
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,590
He looked cool.

254
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,820
I was jealous of those things.

255
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:54,859
- You're cute.
- You have different charms.

256
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:56,330
- You're cute.
- Yes. Exactly.

257
00:11:56,330 --> 00:11:58,029
I was pretty good-looking
when I was in my 20s.

258
00:11:58,029 --> 00:11:59,869
- You're still good-looking.
- You're handsome.

259
00:11:59,869 --> 00:12:01,029
- Don't be like that.
- Okay. Thanks.

260
00:12:01,029 --> 00:12:03,040
(Thanks.)

261
00:12:04,940 --> 00:12:06,369
- Shall we go?
- Shall we?

262
00:12:06,509 --> 00:12:07,639
- Should we go?
- Okay.

263
00:12:07,869 --> 00:12:09,940
How about we walk back like this?

264
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:11,139
- Sure. Let's walk like this.
- Let's tan on the way.

265
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:12,139
Okay.

266
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:14,409
The weather is nice.

267
00:12:14,409 --> 00:12:17,119
(The weather is nice!)

268
00:12:17,979 --> 00:12:21,619
It felt nice walking after swimming.

269
00:12:21,619 --> 00:12:22,759
- That must feel nice.
- Yes.

270
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:25,560
(These two men,
overflowing with wild beauty,)

271
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:28,290
(happily walk along the river.)

272
00:12:29,229 --> 00:12:31,129
That looks like a pictorial.

273
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:32,600
- Yes.
- How cool.

274
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,600
(Looking like models
in a magazine pictorial)

275
00:12:34,999 --> 00:12:37,340
(When they walk by)

276
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:40,909
Look at the dogs lying there.

277
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,440
- Hi.
- Hi.

278
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,180
- Hey!
- Hey!

279
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:46,909
- Hey!
- You guys are so popular.

280
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:48,279
That was very nice.

281
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:51,249
- Everyone says hi so naturally.
- Hello.

282
00:12:51,619 --> 00:12:54,420
People are so cheerful
and aren't afraid to start a conversation.

283
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,489
They like foreigners.

284
00:12:55,489 --> 00:12:57,420
- Right.
- Are you normally a friendly person?

285
00:12:57,420 --> 00:12:59,629
I feel like coming here made me generous.

286
00:12:59,629 --> 00:13:00,859
- Right.
- It just does that.

287
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,659
The Ganges is the river of Mother Ganga.

288
00:13:03,659 --> 00:13:04,659
Right.

289
00:13:04,659 --> 00:13:06,100
(Dex and India are growing closer,
thanks to the river of Mother Ganga.)

290
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,800
If we have to buy new ones...

291
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:08,800
Oh, here?

292
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,970
We wash our clothes here?

293
00:13:12,170 --> 00:13:13,909
(Laundry placed by the river)

294
00:13:13,909 --> 00:13:15,609
- These are our blankets.
- What?

295
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:19,509
They came out nice and clean
from the river of Mother Ganga.

296
00:13:19,509 --> 00:13:21,749
(These white cloths look very familiar.)

297
00:13:21,749 --> 00:13:23,220
Are these hotel sheets?

298
00:13:23,979 --> 00:13:25,149
They're hotel sheets.

299
00:13:25,379 --> 00:13:27,920
- Hotel sheets are just on the street.
- I see.

300
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:29,119
- You're right.
- Towels too.

301
00:13:29,119 --> 00:13:30,259
The pillowcases are here too.

302
00:13:30,259 --> 00:13:31,720
- Drying in the sun.
- Oh, my. There are so many.

303
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:35,090
We were always in Mother Ganga's arms.

304
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:37,229
(Mother Ganga's arms)

305
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:39,430
It's getting crowded.

306
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:40,470
(The streets are slowly getting crowded.)

307
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:43,139
- Hello!
- Hello!

308
00:13:43,139 --> 00:13:44,670
- Oh, my.
- Massage?

309
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:45,769
Oh, they do...

310
00:13:45,769 --> 00:13:47,609
massages on the street.

311
00:13:47,609 --> 00:13:49,710
There are many people
who give massages like that.

312
00:13:49,710 --> 00:13:51,440
- On the street like that?
- Yes.

313
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:54,909
- Massage.
- Massage?

314
00:13:54,909 --> 00:13:56,119
Massage. Body massage.

315
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,479
How much?

316
00:13:57,680 --> 00:13:59,249
How much is the massage?

317
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:02,920
(Suddenly shaking his hand)

318
00:14:03,489 --> 00:14:07,190
Okay. I understand.

319
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:08,830
- Massage?
- Massage?

320
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:09,899
- How much?
- How much?

321
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,330
(While Kian84 is being held,
they surround Dex.)

322
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,100
- They suddenly crowded around me.
- Oh, no.

323
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:15,369
(Confused)

324
00:14:15,629 --> 00:14:16,769
- How much?
- Oh, okay.

325
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:19,440
Money. How much is it?

326
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:20,710
(Continuing to massage his hand
without answering)

327
00:14:21,109 --> 00:14:23,009
(Starting to massage Dex's hand too)

328
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:25,479
Okay. I understand.

329
00:14:25,609 --> 00:14:27,979
Okay. Let's try.

330
00:14:27,979 --> 00:14:30,350
- Sitting. Come.
- Hey.

331
00:14:30,820 --> 00:14:32,119
How much?

332
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:36,019
He won't tell me how much it is.

333
00:14:36,019 --> 00:14:38,190
(He is only quietly holding his hand...)

334
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,889
I hope they haggle well first.

335
00:14:39,889 --> 00:14:40,960
- I know.
- Really?

336
00:14:40,960 --> 00:14:42,830
You're quite good at haggling, aren't you?

337
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:45,629
- It wasn't easy in India, even for me.
- I see.

338
00:14:45,830 --> 00:14:47,830
How are you supposed to haggle?

339
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,739
Are you supposed to go really low,

340
00:14:49,739 --> 00:14:51,239
- and then...
- You have to be bold.

341
00:14:51,239 --> 00:14:52,670
The most important thing...

342
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:55,509
is to look uninterested.

343
00:14:55,509 --> 00:14:56,810
- Like you don't care if you don't get it?
- Yes.

344
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,779
"I don't need this. I'm going."

345
00:14:58,779 --> 00:15:01,249
You need to look like that.
Even if that's not the truth.

346
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,920
- But it's not easy to act.
- No.

347
00:15:04,249 --> 00:15:05,820
I'm worried. How did they do?

348
00:15:07,019 --> 00:15:10,159
(They move with no time to haggle.)

349
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:15,489
(What is that sack?)

350
00:15:17,029 --> 00:15:18,460
The one with the hole for the face.

351
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:22,639
(Don't you have a massage bed
with the hole for the face?)

352
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,940
No seat?

353
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,570
(No seat? Go over there.)

354
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:28,970
- There must be another place.
- Another...

355
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,109
They are moving.

356
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,109
- They are moving the whole store.
- Yes.

357
00:15:34,249 --> 00:15:35,950
Anywhere he wants.

358
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,320
That's great.

359
00:15:37,649 --> 00:15:41,649
(VIP seat with a great view)

360
00:15:42,249 --> 00:15:44,420
(Dex follows Kian84...)

361
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,859
(and gets a seat upgrade.)

362
00:15:48,029 --> 00:15:51,029
(He is bewildered,
with his shoulders seized.)

363
00:15:51,629 --> 00:15:54,330
(It's okay. We just have to trust them.)

364
00:15:54,769 --> 00:15:57,940
(He is twice as cautious.)

365
00:15:58,840 --> 00:16:01,409
(Comfortable)

366
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,909
(But...)

367
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,509
What are they doing?

368
00:16:08,149 --> 00:16:10,119
(Suddenly)

369
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:12,479
How many people are working on us?

370
00:16:14,649 --> 00:16:16,560
How many people are working on us?

371
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,989
It's okay.

372
00:16:17,989 --> 00:16:20,489
(Many...)

373
00:16:20,830 --> 00:16:22,600
Look at him.

374
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:25,499
- Are they all a team?
- I have no idea.

375
00:16:25,659 --> 00:16:27,600
- Are they all masseurs?
- What is that?

376
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:29,940
Gosh, how many are working on him?

377
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:31,999
What's going on?

378
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:35,009
How many people are there?

379
00:16:35,239 --> 00:16:36,779
- There are five.
- What is that?

380
00:16:36,779 --> 00:16:38,080
That's so funny.

381
00:16:38,210 --> 00:16:41,680
I thought I was being kidnapped.

382
00:16:41,909 --> 00:16:43,720
Before I realized it,

383
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,850
there were so many hands.

384
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:48,749
It felt like I was being dragged
by a monster with many hands.

385
00:16:49,859 --> 00:16:51,989
Just one person.

386
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,930
I want one person.

387
00:16:53,930 --> 00:16:55,930
(No way.)

388
00:16:56,930 --> 00:16:58,460
How many people are working on us?

389
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,399
(Dex is also getting a good treatment.)

390
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:05,670
(Others have 2 at the most...)

391
00:17:06,639 --> 00:17:08,139
(Dex: 4 people)

392
00:17:08,710 --> 00:17:10,310
(Kian84: 5 people)

393
00:17:10,879 --> 00:17:13,379
(They have a luxurious total of 9 people.)

394
00:17:13,379 --> 00:17:15,009
"Luxurious?"

395
00:17:15,479 --> 00:17:18,580
There were nine people,
before they knew it.

396
00:17:18,580 --> 00:17:20,119
"Luxurious?"

397
00:17:20,119 --> 00:17:22,090
- It is luxurious.
- We can't see them.

398
00:17:22,090 --> 00:17:23,259
- Look at them.
- That's so funny.

399
00:17:23,259 --> 00:17:25,859
When we go to a massage shop in Korea,

400
00:17:25,859 --> 00:17:27,529
- we can ask for four hands...
- Yes.

401
00:17:27,529 --> 00:17:29,859
- and pay a higher price.
- Yes.

402
00:17:29,859 --> 00:17:32,300
- This is 10 hands.
- It's 10 hands.

403
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:33,499
- It's 10 hands.
- It's a royal version.

404
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:36,200
(They are getting 10 hands,
without knowing the price.)

405
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:38,499
What if they ask for 100 dollars?

406
00:17:39,470 --> 00:17:41,269
This massage is too much.

407
00:17:42,210 --> 00:17:44,810
(And the gaze from this person
is too much.)

408
00:17:44,979 --> 00:17:47,310
(Interesting)

409
00:17:47,710 --> 00:17:49,649
- That's so funny.
- I haven't seen anything like this.

410
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:51,080
How did this happen?

411
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:53,149
Are you a professional?

412
00:17:53,149 --> 00:17:54,249
Yes.

413
00:17:54,249 --> 00:17:55,960
- Are you a professional?
- I am.

414
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:57,659
For how long?

415
00:17:57,659 --> 00:17:59,729
- For 10 years.
- For 10 years?

416
00:17:59,729 --> 00:18:00,790
- Yes, everyone here.
- No way.

417
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,729
- Everyone here?
- Yes.

418
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,960
- Hey, Dex.
- Yes?

419
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:05,999
Does it feel good?

420
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,869
Well, they said they are professionals.

421
00:18:07,869 --> 00:18:09,369
They're not professionals.

422
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:12,639
A few of them are just touching me.

423
00:18:13,239 --> 00:18:16,040
(Pinching)

424
00:18:16,409 --> 00:18:17,940
- What is that?
- Look at that.

425
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,710
- Are they making dumplings?
- What is that?

426
00:18:20,249 --> 00:18:22,109
(Pinching them like dumplings)

427
00:18:22,109 --> 00:18:24,779
- They got busted.
- Look at them.

428
00:18:25,420 --> 00:18:27,590
One person is just touching me.

429
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:28,820
- I know.
- He's just touching me.

430
00:18:28,820 --> 00:18:29,960
One person keeps touching the same spot.

431
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:32,220
- He is.
- They're just bored.

432
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:34,389
I think that...

433
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:37,859
The two on my legs are just freeloading.

434
00:18:38,030 --> 00:18:39,800
It's like they are lipsyncing
in a group song.

435
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,399
Some are just touching him.

436
00:18:42,330 --> 00:18:45,669
- One hour?
- His phone keeps ringing.

437
00:18:46,639 --> 00:18:47,840
(He got a call mid-massage.)

438
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,909
He must be getting a reservation.

439
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:51,139
He must have two jobs.

440
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,350
The floor is so hard.

441
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:55,449
Yes.

442
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:58,520
(He is really a pro.)

443
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:01,290
(This masseur has nice hair.)

444
00:19:01,649 --> 00:19:03,020
(He only focuses...)

445
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,520
(on scratching his head.)

446
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:06,459
Isn't he just scratching your head?

447
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:08,590
(Pulling)

448
00:19:09,929 --> 00:19:12,500
There are six people,
but it doesn't feel good at all.

449
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:16,040
I heard that...

450
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,969
when you watch ants at work...

451
00:19:17,969 --> 00:19:19,740
only 40 percent of the ants...

452
00:19:19,740 --> 00:19:21,840
are actually at work,

453
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,740
- That's right.
- and 30 percent does nothing.

454
00:19:25,179 --> 00:19:27,409
(Freeloading ants)

455
00:19:27,649 --> 00:19:29,879
It was like that.

456
00:19:30,919 --> 00:19:33,649
(The two can not get out of it.)

457
00:19:33,649 --> 00:19:35,419
Gosh, okay.

458
00:19:35,550 --> 00:19:37,260
I love India.

459
00:19:37,359 --> 00:19:39,530
(He wants them to go easy.)

460
00:19:39,790 --> 00:19:42,290
- Relax.
- What?

461
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:46,000
(Calm down and relax.)

462
00:19:46,030 --> 00:19:48,699
(Getting him a pillow)

463
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:52,240
- That's his shoe.
- Look at that.

464
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,409
That's yours.

465
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:55,209
- Yes, it's mine.
- That's your shoe.

466
00:19:55,869 --> 00:19:57,179
Who's shoe is that?

467
00:19:57,179 --> 00:19:59,040
Why are they using that as a pillow?

468
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,810
Strong.

469
00:20:00,810 --> 00:20:01,850
(Pressing)

470
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:04,949
(That shoe...)

471
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,090
He stepped on poo with that.

472
00:20:07,090 --> 00:20:08,090
Really?

473
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,290
Shoot.

474
00:20:09,719 --> 00:20:10,919
It's holy.

475
00:20:14,159 --> 00:20:15,889
Why is your shoe here?

476
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,730
(Holy)

477
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:20,270
They're burying my face in your shoe.

478
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:25,300
(His face is full of holiness.)

479
00:20:28,109 --> 00:20:30,379
(He fights for an alternative.)

480
00:20:30,379 --> 00:20:32,080
(Yes, my shoe!)

481
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:33,709
(Jammed)

482
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:37,449
(He barely gets it and smells it.)

483
00:20:37,449 --> 00:20:39,219
(I can't use this either.)

484
00:20:43,590 --> 00:20:46,760
This is an Indian local massage shop.

485
00:20:47,629 --> 00:20:51,500
They say they have
ten years of experience,

486
00:20:52,030 --> 00:20:54,429
but I think they're only touching
the same place.

487
00:20:54,429 --> 00:20:56,770
(Hush)

488
00:20:57,369 --> 00:20:59,469
How are you feeling?

489
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,510
Two people are freeloading.

490
00:21:01,510 --> 00:21:02,669
(He tells on them.)

491
00:21:02,669 --> 00:21:03,939
Two people are freeloading.

492
00:21:03,939 --> 00:21:05,909
I can tell exactly.

493
00:21:06,379 --> 00:21:08,050
Two of them.

494
00:21:08,780 --> 00:21:10,520
The one working on my leg...

495
00:21:11,419 --> 00:21:13,389
- is also...
- Right?

496
00:21:13,389 --> 00:21:15,250
- This isn't a massage.
- They're freeloading.

497
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,659
Say something. Powerful.

498
00:21:17,859 --> 00:21:19,459
- Ouch.
- Hey.

499
00:21:19,689 --> 00:21:21,790
- What?
- Did you see that?

500
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:24,459
- What?
- Did you see that?

501
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:26,030
- I saw that.
- What?

502
00:21:26,030 --> 00:21:27,629
- Wait a minute.
- Seriously?

503
00:21:27,730 --> 00:21:30,199
He was seriously just a passerby.

504
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:31,600
(Embarrassed,
he was seriously just a passerby!)

505
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:34,439
- They don't usually do that at massages.
- What is happening?

506
00:21:34,669 --> 00:21:36,510
Why is he doing that?

507
00:21:38,639 --> 00:21:40,149
(Just then...)

508
00:21:40,510 --> 00:21:41,750
(Warning)

509
00:21:41,750 --> 00:21:44,020
Tell them to do better.
We will be paying them.

510
00:21:44,619 --> 00:21:46,219
I don't even know how much they will ask.

511
00:21:46,449 --> 00:21:47,850
We're going to be ripped off.

512
00:21:48,649 --> 00:21:51,359
Gosh, but I don't think he...

513
00:21:51,859 --> 00:21:53,159
washed his hands...

514
00:21:54,090 --> 00:21:55,629
His hands are a bit...

515
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,699
They're damp.

516
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,500
My face...

517
00:22:01,129 --> 00:22:03,139
Sir, no.

518
00:22:03,139 --> 00:22:05,469
Face, okay.

519
00:22:05,469 --> 00:22:07,840
Okay.

520
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:09,270
(He protects with his body
since he cannot communicate.)

521
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:10,980
I want my scalp.

522
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:13,850
(He gets up to get a scalp massage.)

523
00:22:13,850 --> 00:22:15,510
Yes, okay.

524
00:22:17,219 --> 00:22:19,250
(What?)

525
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:21,990
- What? Are you getting praised?
- I don't know.

526
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:24,159
- They're all different.
- You're getting praised.

527
00:22:24,659 --> 00:22:26,730
Is he brushing off my dandruff?
Why is he doing that?

528
00:22:27,429 --> 00:22:28,859
It doesn't feel good at all.

529
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,030
Why is he doing that to my head?

530
00:22:32,699 --> 00:22:35,129
- Do you want a therapy massage?
- A therapy massage?

531
00:22:35,230 --> 00:22:37,139
- Yes.
- Thank you.

532
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:38,399
- There is something.
- Okay.

533
00:22:38,399 --> 00:22:40,040
There is a method.

534
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,240
They have a technique.

535
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:43,679
- Wait a minute.
- Why did he put that in my hair?

536
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,010
- What is that?
- Is he styling it?

537
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:50,020
I still question it.

538
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,719
Why did they dust my hair like that?

539
00:22:51,719 --> 00:22:54,750
It didn't even feel good.

540
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:56,320
What is this?

541
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,389
(Somewhere between a hair shop
and a massage shop)

542
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,760
I respect it since it is the culture here.

543
00:23:00,859 --> 00:23:03,399
Their hands were weak,

544
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:05,800
but they did massage me.

545
00:23:06,159 --> 00:23:07,530
It was a new experience.

546
00:23:07,770 --> 00:23:09,500
- Nice?
- Nice.

547
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,840
He accepts it since he respects them.

548
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:14,340
(The pure traveler accepts
the cultural difference.)

549
00:23:16,980 --> 00:23:18,280
Goodness.

550
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:21,149
This sure is a massage.

551
00:23:22,209 --> 00:23:24,980
We're in front of the holy Ganges River,

552
00:23:24,980 --> 00:23:27,350
and I almost called out
the Buddhist scripture.

553
00:23:29,859 --> 00:23:31,159
What is going on with him?

554
00:23:31,719 --> 00:23:34,030
They were doing wrestling moves on him.

555
00:23:34,030 --> 00:23:36,629
- From behind.
- Why are you doing another match?

556
00:23:36,629 --> 00:23:38,800
- They were choking me.
- It's another match.

557
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,500
- They were choking me like this.
- Like this?

558
00:23:40,500 --> 00:23:42,830
Why are you doing
another wrestling match over there?

559
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:45,270
- What is that?
- It wasn't a massage.

560
00:23:45,270 --> 00:23:47,169
Your face seems to be enjoying it.

561
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:50,540
(Soaring adrenalin)

562
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,010
(Groaning)

563
00:23:53,010 --> 00:23:54,280
(Screaming)

564
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,980
I'm dizzy.

565
00:23:55,980 --> 00:23:58,119
(Ear massage next)

566
00:23:59,990 --> 00:24:02,449
(Hey friend...)

567
00:24:02,449 --> 00:24:05,020
(You have two ears.)

568
00:24:05,719 --> 00:24:06,929
What's wrong?

569
00:24:07,659 --> 00:24:09,189
(Laughing)

570
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:10,929
I like it.

571
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:14,230
- Have you had a spiritual awakening?
- It's not refreshing at all.

572
00:24:16,070 --> 00:24:17,840
You look like a really loved newborn.

573
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:21,609
(Looking like a really loved newborn)

574
00:24:21,909 --> 00:24:24,379
(He became younger
thanks to the Indian massage.)

575
00:24:25,040 --> 00:24:26,080
(He is falling into it, just like Kian84.)

576
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:28,109
Good.

577
00:24:28,750 --> 00:24:32,419
- Feeling good.
- "Feeling good?"

578
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,189
(Whispering)

579
00:24:35,189 --> 00:24:37,159
- What?
- What time is it?

580
00:24:37,219 --> 00:24:38,790
- It's 5,000.
- What?

581
00:24:39,389 --> 00:24:40,959
- It's 5,000?
- Yes.

582
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:43,500
- Ten minutes?
- What?

583
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,899
- It's 5,000?
- Finished?

584
00:24:45,199 --> 00:24:46,330
- Ten more.
- Quiet.

585
00:24:46,330 --> 00:24:47,629
Are you kidding me?

586
00:24:49,669 --> 00:24:52,139
(Yesterday, when he was blessed,)

587
00:24:52,139 --> 00:24:53,169
(it was 5,000 rupees.)

588
00:24:53,169 --> 00:24:54,770
The prayer was also 5,000.

589
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:57,209
- I guess they start with 5,000.
- Yes.

590
00:24:57,209 --> 00:24:59,750
They just give a high price first.

591
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,310
- They're not really asking for it.
- They do?

592
00:25:02,310 --> 00:25:04,550
They just say it first,
and then work down.

593
00:25:04,820 --> 00:25:06,850
He said everyone will be happy
if we pay 5,000.

594
00:25:07,520 --> 00:25:08,590
But 5,000 rupees...

595
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:09,689
- How much is that?
- How much?

596
00:25:09,689 --> 00:25:10,889
It's 80 dollars.

597
00:25:11,790 --> 00:25:13,760
It's similar to the price in Korea.

598
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,129
(Super positive)

599
00:25:15,429 --> 00:25:18,560
But in Korea, one masseur...

600
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:20,629
- costs 80 or 90 dollars.
- Yes.

601
00:25:20,730 --> 00:25:22,899
- There were five people.
- I could accept the price.

602
00:25:22,899 --> 00:25:24,899
- Since there were five people?
- Yes.

603
00:25:24,899 --> 00:25:26,510
So was that about an hour?

604
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,570
- How long was it?
- It seemed shorter.

605
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:29,139
- It was about 15 minutes.
- Yes.

606
00:25:29,139 --> 00:25:30,709
- No way.
- That was too short.

607
00:25:30,709 --> 00:25:32,939
You shouldn't fall for it.
It's an absurd price.

608
00:25:32,939 --> 00:25:33,949
That's too much.

609
00:25:33,949 --> 00:25:35,580
You have to haggle.

610
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:36,719
Thank you.

611
00:25:36,719 --> 00:25:37,750
Yes.

612
00:25:38,179 --> 00:25:39,250
Okay.

613
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:40,490
When did you...

614
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:44,520
(He gives them 500 rupees each.)

615
00:25:44,619 --> 00:25:46,119
- One more.
- Okay.

616
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:47,490
- No.
- One more.

617
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:48,530
Enough.

618
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:50,100
Enough.

619
00:25:50,730 --> 00:25:52,429
- His eyes are firm.
- That's it.

620
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:53,869
(Hesitating)

621
00:25:54,429 --> 00:25:56,399
(Anxious)

622
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,570
- No.
- Okay.

623
00:25:58,570 --> 00:25:59,669
(Firm)

624
00:25:59,669 --> 00:26:01,240
- Oh, good.
- That's it.

625
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,540
- It's about the tension.
- Yes.

626
00:26:02,540 --> 00:26:04,439
- Dex was firm about this.
- That was 42 dollars.

627
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:05,939
- Give them 500 each.
- Okay.

628
00:26:05,939 --> 00:26:07,050
Don't give them more.

629
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,080
They will ask for more.

630
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:12,050
(He makes sure,
after succeeding in haggling.)

631
00:26:13,790 --> 00:26:16,919
(Kian84 got a massage from 5 people.)

632
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:18,520
It's 500 each.

633
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,659
Here.

634
00:26:19,659 --> 00:26:21,330
(He gives 500 to 2 people...)

635
00:26:21,330 --> 00:26:23,659
(To 3 people, 4 people...)

636
00:26:23,659 --> 00:26:25,000
(To 5 people...)

637
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:26,159
(To 6 people?)

638
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:27,429
Six people?

639
00:26:27,730 --> 00:26:28,869
Six? What?

640
00:26:28,869 --> 00:26:30,270
- Who is that guy?
- There's another one.

641
00:26:30,270 --> 00:26:31,300
Who is that?

642
00:26:31,300 --> 00:26:32,740
Why did he get the money?

643
00:26:33,969 --> 00:26:36,270
(He was about to leave...)

644
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:37,679
They're saying something.

645
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:41,050
(It suddenly turns serious.)

646
00:26:41,050 --> 00:26:42,179
Why are you fighting?

647
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:43,949
Don't fight.

648
00:26:44,350 --> 00:26:45,520
I'll give you more. Don't fight.

649
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:46,550
(I'll give you more. Don't fight.)

650
00:26:46,550 --> 00:26:48,090
(Goodness!)

651
00:26:48,290 --> 00:26:50,820
What are you doing?

652
00:26:51,389 --> 00:26:52,859
- My goodness.
- Peace.

653
00:26:53,859 --> 00:26:55,090
Don't fight.

654
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:56,359
Thank you.

655
00:26:56,830 --> 00:26:58,500
Okay. Don't fight.

656
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:00,600
What are you doing?

657
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,540
(Massage fee, a total of 3,500 rupees,
which is about 56 dollars)

658
00:27:07,869 --> 00:27:11,409
I think there were about
seven people at the most.

659
00:27:11,409 --> 00:27:14,010
But there was no space, so some left.

660
00:27:15,609 --> 00:27:17,520
I'm not sure.

661
00:27:17,619 --> 00:27:20,050
But I just go with the flow,
now that I'm getting older.

662
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:21,550
"Just take it."

663
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,889
It's not a big deal anyway.

664
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:28,159
- He didn't want them to fight.
- Yes.

665
00:27:28,530 --> 00:27:31,260
You need to act like Dex, as a traveler.

666
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:32,699
- Yes.
- You have to be firm.

667
00:27:32,699 --> 00:27:35,469
- You need to be firm about your limits.
- Yes.

668
00:27:35,469 --> 00:27:36,869
- That's right.
- Yes.

669
00:27:36,869 --> 00:27:39,100
- But looking at this,
- Yes.

670
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,740
- I'm sort of a pacifist, like Kian84.
- Yes.

671
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:43,840
- I don't want people to fight.
- Yes.

672
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:45,909
I think I would have
given it to them as well.

673
00:27:46,179 --> 00:27:47,350
- Just like Kian84.
- Me too.

674
00:27:47,350 --> 00:27:48,949
I'm like that as well.

675
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:50,580
- Right.
- I would say something...

676
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,820
- if I spoke the language,
- Yes.

677
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,790
but since that's not the case...

678
00:27:53,889 --> 00:27:55,889
- And they're older, so...
- Yes.

679
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:57,290
And it was hectic.

680
00:27:57,290 --> 00:27:59,290
- Yes.
- It got confusing.

681
00:27:59,290 --> 00:28:00,830
It could happen
since he was not used to it.

682
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:02,490
This can happen to anyone...

683
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,129
- while traveling.
- Sure.

684
00:28:05,129 --> 00:28:07,199
There is no right way.

685
00:28:07,199 --> 00:28:09,199
- You're right.
- It's because there is no answer.

686
00:28:09,199 --> 00:28:10,570
- Yes.
- There's no right answer.

687
00:28:11,570 --> 00:28:13,570
I remembered something we must do.

688
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:15,240
We need to change more money.

689
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,240
- Money?
- Yes.

690
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:18,240
We only have 500 rupee bills.

691
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,909
- Yes.
- We need 100 rupee bills.

692
00:28:20,909 --> 00:28:21,909
By 100?

693
00:28:21,909 --> 00:28:25,250
We only had 500 rupee bills.

694
00:28:25,250 --> 00:28:27,889
- Yes.
- You need smaller notes.

695
00:28:29,149 --> 00:28:31,959
We burned as many calories
as we did while working out.

696
00:28:32,189 --> 00:28:34,159
- Right?
- Getting a massage is hard.

697
00:28:34,859 --> 00:28:36,490
- I'm hungry. Let's go.
- Yes.

698
00:28:36,830 --> 00:28:38,000
Let's go and eat.

699
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,929
You got hungry after getting a massage.

700
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,969
(Laughing)

701
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,969
(It all turns into memories.)

702
00:28:45,439 --> 00:28:47,669
It wasn't a massage,
but it was some technique.

703
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:49,540
I lost all my energy.

704
00:28:50,709 --> 00:28:51,740
It's here.

705
00:28:52,609 --> 00:28:53,679
- This one.
- Here.

706
00:28:54,149 --> 00:28:55,649
- The hotel.
- Our guesthouse.

707
00:28:57,379 --> 00:28:58,949
This is the restaurant. I found it.

708
00:29:00,750 --> 00:29:01,850
Gosh, it's hot.

709
00:29:04,119 --> 00:29:06,159
- Hello?
- Hello.

710
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:07,359
(Hello)

711
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:09,389
- Hello?
- Hello.

712
00:29:10,129 --> 00:29:12,399
(They enter politely.)

713
00:29:12,859 --> 00:29:14,969
Gosh, the view is...

714
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:17,800
(Amazed)

715
00:29:18,369 --> 00:29:20,209
- It's amazing.
- The river view.

716
00:29:22,270 --> 00:29:23,840
Gosh, it's good.

717
00:29:24,109 --> 00:29:25,439
Menu, please.

718
00:29:26,209 --> 00:29:27,510
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

719
00:29:28,649 --> 00:29:31,619
I don't like strong smells.

720
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:33,850
No vegetables.

721
00:29:34,189 --> 00:29:35,419
We only have vegetables.

722
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:36,919
All vegetables?

723
00:29:37,590 --> 00:29:38,719
- Only vegetables.
- Only vegetables?

724
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:39,760
Really?

725
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,990
(They can only order vegetarian meals.)

726
00:29:42,590 --> 00:29:43,629
Chicken?

727
00:29:43,899 --> 00:29:44,929
No chicken.

728
00:29:44,929 --> 00:29:46,530
- No chicken? Okay.
- Okay.

729
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:48,270
They have eggs.

730
00:29:48,330 --> 00:29:50,439
- Boiled egg?
- Boiled egg? One.

731
00:29:50,439 --> 00:29:51,639
One boiled egg.

732
00:29:51,639 --> 00:29:54,310
And where is the rice?

733
00:29:55,169 --> 00:29:56,209
The rice.

734
00:29:56,209 --> 00:29:59,340
I will have the egg biryani. One.

735
00:29:59,709 --> 00:30:00,709
Okay.

736
00:30:00,709 --> 00:30:02,750
I want one cheese omelet...

737
00:30:03,149 --> 00:30:05,219
and one tomato sauce spaghetti.

738
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,619
You can't go wrong with that.

739
00:30:07,619 --> 00:30:08,649
Sure.

740
00:30:10,459 --> 00:30:11,560
It's hot.

741
00:30:12,719 --> 00:30:14,959
(It is 10 a.m.,
and the temperature is 32°C.)

742
00:30:14,959 --> 00:30:16,659
- We could burn to death.
- Right?

743
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,100
It's here.

744
00:30:20,899 --> 00:30:21,929
(The food is finally here.)

745
00:30:21,929 --> 00:30:24,070
- Thank you.
- Okay, thank you.

746
00:30:24,699 --> 00:30:26,300
- Here.
- All right.

747
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,310
Thank you.

748
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:29,540
Let's have a drink.

749
00:30:29,770 --> 00:30:31,840
- It was so hot.
- Here.

750
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:37,580
(Gulping)

751
00:30:37,580 --> 00:30:39,619
- That looks so refreshing.
- Gosh.

752
00:30:39,619 --> 00:30:41,219
That must be so good.

753
00:30:45,290 --> 00:30:46,490
What's wrong? Was it too cold?

754
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,990
- Was it because it was so good?
- It was so good.

755
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:51,530
This is what I ordered.

756
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,800
- It's...
- This is my egg.

757
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Biryani is Indian fried rice.

758
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:58,040
- Biryani?
- Spaghetti?

759
00:30:58,040 --> 00:30:59,740
- It's hard to go wrong with that.
- That's good.

760
00:31:01,439 --> 00:31:03,310
- What is that?
- This is just...

761
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,679
It's fried egg.

762
00:31:06,340 --> 00:31:07,649
- It's fried?
- Yes.

763
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:10,480
- Have some rice.
- Okay.

764
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,780
(He takes a big bite of the local food.)

765
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:15,020
(Enjoying)

766
00:31:15,990 --> 00:31:17,520
- How is it?
- It's so hot.

767
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:20,359
Here.

768
00:31:20,359 --> 00:31:22,490
(He takes a careful bite.)

769
00:31:24,129 --> 00:31:25,230
How is it?

770
00:31:26,359 --> 00:31:27,429
(Enjoying)

771
00:31:27,429 --> 00:31:28,469
- Is it good?
- It's okay.

772
00:31:28,469 --> 00:31:30,169
Yes, it's good.

773
00:31:30,340 --> 00:31:31,699
Okay. Pass.

774
00:31:33,909 --> 00:31:35,609
How is it? Is there any cilantro?

775
00:31:35,609 --> 00:31:36,609
Cilantro?

776
00:31:36,609 --> 00:31:38,379
- I can't...
- Why do you hate cilantro?

777
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:40,350
- I can't...
- Is cilantro your enemy?

778
00:31:40,350 --> 00:31:41,850
I don't eat cucumbers either.

779
00:31:42,350 --> 00:31:44,080
I heard you say...

780
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:46,350
you hate those about ten times here.

781
00:31:46,619 --> 00:31:48,619
I kept reminding him.

782
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,359
(Do you eat cilantro?)

783
00:31:51,359 --> 00:31:52,389
(I can't eat that.)

784
00:31:52,889 --> 00:31:53,929
(I can't eat cilantro.)

785
00:31:53,929 --> 00:31:55,530
That darned cilantro.

786
00:31:56,590 --> 00:31:58,699
(The baby hates strong smells.)

787
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:02,070
He is a hippie in terms of his physique,

788
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,899
but he has a weak stomach.

789
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:08,209
I will eat all your cucumbers
and cilantro for you.

790
00:32:08,469 --> 00:32:10,639
- Do you eat those?
- I do.

791
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,379
You can eat it.

792
00:32:12,379 --> 00:32:14,949
There are no cucumbers
or cilantro in this.

793
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:17,080
- Really? Let me try.
- Yes.

794
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,649
Try it.

795
00:32:18,649 --> 00:32:19,919
(Baby Dex tries the local food.)

796
00:32:19,919 --> 00:32:21,290
(Eating)

797
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,820
(Will it suit the baby's tastes?)

798
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:24,889
How is it?

799
00:32:25,389 --> 00:32:26,590
It's okay, isn't it?

800
00:32:26,590 --> 00:32:27,590
(Let me see...)

801
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,530
- It's okay, isn't it?
- What is that?

802
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,899
It's okay,
but it tastes too much of vegetables.

803
00:32:33,399 --> 00:32:35,169
- Oh.
- Bell peppers,

804
00:32:35,169 --> 00:32:37,100
onions, peppers...

805
00:32:37,100 --> 00:32:38,199
What?

806
00:32:38,199 --> 00:32:40,169
You just don't like vegetables, do you?

807
00:32:40,169 --> 00:32:41,770
He has a baby's taste buds.

808
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:42,810
It's true.

809
00:32:43,939 --> 00:32:45,810
(However, the older brother...)

810
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:47,810
(Eating)

811
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,149
- It's good.
- What is this?

812
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,590
(He is enjoying the local food.)

813
00:32:55,119 --> 00:32:56,959
Kian84 can eat anything.

814
00:32:56,959 --> 00:32:58,619
Kian84 has a good stomach.

815
00:32:58,619 --> 00:32:59,689
(Amazed)

816
00:32:59,919 --> 00:33:02,359
I think my stomach...

817
00:33:02,459 --> 00:33:04,899
Do you know the Komodo Dragon?

818
00:33:05,159 --> 00:33:06,929
Its gastric juice is so strong...

819
00:33:06,929 --> 00:33:09,000
that it even melts bacteria.

820
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,939
I think my gastric juice is strong...

821
00:33:10,939 --> 00:33:12,399
like the Komodo Dragon.

822
00:33:12,399 --> 00:33:14,139
I was worried about food,

823
00:33:14,409 --> 00:33:15,740
but I think I'm okay.

824
00:33:15,969 --> 00:33:17,879
I don't get sick often.

825
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:20,350
Kian84's stomach...

826
00:33:20,580 --> 00:33:24,149
already went through so much.

827
00:33:24,149 --> 00:33:25,980
I think it surpassed humankind.

828
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:28,290
It already went through an evolution.

829
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:29,350
That's what I think.

830
00:33:29,350 --> 00:33:30,590
(He is a Neoanthropinae
that already went through an evolution.)

831
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:31,959
It's not just strong,

832
00:33:31,959 --> 00:33:34,830
he won't even get sick,
no matter what he eats.

833
00:33:35,290 --> 00:33:36,429
Good.

834
00:33:37,500 --> 00:33:38,929
He can eat anything.

835
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,929
Even things that were on the floor.

836
00:33:40,929 --> 00:33:42,070
(He is the Human Komodo.)

837
00:33:42,869 --> 00:33:45,399
(The Human Komodo hunts the local food.)

838
00:33:46,100 --> 00:33:47,369
(Looking)

839
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:49,840
- There are camels here.
- Where?

840
00:33:50,310 --> 00:33:52,810
Across the river over there. Camels.

841
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,780
I'm very curious about that place.

842
00:33:56,409 --> 00:33:58,949
(There is a vast land of sand.)

843
00:33:58,949 --> 00:34:00,919
Watching the sunset there...

844
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,790
is a very wonderful experience.

845
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:04,119
A lot of people go there at sundown.

846
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,419
- Goodness.
- It's a camel.

847
00:34:08,560 --> 00:34:10,830
There are lots of hotels
and restaurants now.

848
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:12,459
It's a vacation spot?

849
00:34:12,859 --> 00:34:15,300
(Across the river...)

850
00:34:15,300 --> 00:34:16,730
(is a place of life and death.)

851
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,600
It's so...

852
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:21,310
That's odd. It's peculiar.

853
00:34:21,310 --> 00:34:23,810
It's a different place,
divided by the river.

854
00:34:24,409 --> 00:34:25,540
Two types of cities.

855
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,649
(The two different tastes
came together to eat.)

856
00:34:30,379 --> 00:34:31,449
(Enjoying)

857
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:33,379
That's it.

858
00:34:34,050 --> 00:34:35,590
- This is a nice eating show.
- I liked it.

859
00:34:36,189 --> 00:34:37,859
(Their palates might be different.)

860
00:34:39,619 --> 00:34:41,689
(But the meal satisfied...)

861
00:34:41,689 --> 00:34:44,530
(both the picky eater
and the human Komodo dragon.)

862
00:34:46,859 --> 00:34:49,199
Our room... It's lunchtime.

863
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,899
So we have to check out soon.

864
00:34:50,899 --> 00:34:52,240
- Really?
- Yes.

865
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,010
But we need to take a shower.

866
00:34:54,010 --> 00:34:55,409
We also have to do laundry.

867
00:34:55,409 --> 00:34:58,310
I think we should go and extend
our stay for one more day.

868
00:34:59,179 --> 00:35:00,980
We made a spontaneous decision...

869
00:35:00,980 --> 00:35:03,250
to prolong our stay for one more day.

870
00:35:03,649 --> 00:35:05,879
It was too hot for us
to go somewhere else.

871
00:35:06,050 --> 00:35:07,590
- It wasn't bad.
- Right.

872
00:35:07,590 --> 00:35:08,889
- You're okay with that, right?
- How much is this?

873
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:10,250
I'll pay for this.

874
00:35:10,619 --> 00:35:13,459
- Gosh, Kian84.
- It's my treat. It's not a lot.

875
00:35:13,859 --> 00:35:15,859
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

876
00:35:15,859 --> 00:35:17,000
Thank you for the meal.

877
00:35:18,100 --> 00:35:20,800
<i>- Let's go</i>
- Yes.

878
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:22,429
I want to take a shower.

879
00:35:22,429 --> 00:35:24,369
(He buys a meal for Dex
as if it's nothing.)

880
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,740
Around this time of the day, in India...

881
00:35:27,740 --> 00:35:29,770
- The receptionist.
- The receptionist.

882
00:35:29,770 --> 00:35:30,939
Right. One day.

883
00:35:30,939 --> 00:35:32,179
(Namaste)

884
00:35:32,609 --> 00:35:33,780
Master.

885
00:35:33,780 --> 00:35:37,679
We will stay here for one more day.

886
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:40,119
- Yes.
- One more day. An extension.

887
00:35:41,420 --> 00:35:42,549
How much?

888
00:35:43,389 --> 00:35:45,520
- It's about 4,000.
- It's 4,000, sir.

889
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:46,989
- And...
- Okay.

890
00:35:46,989 --> 00:35:50,759
- And our beds...
- Yes.

891
00:35:51,029 --> 00:35:52,659
- Clean?
- Sure.

892
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:54,869
- Reform?
- "Reform?"

893
00:35:54,969 --> 00:35:56,569
- If you give me the key,
- Okay.

894
00:35:56,569 --> 00:35:58,170
the maid will go and clean everything.

895
00:35:58,170 --> 00:36:01,009
Okay. But sir, can we...

896
00:36:01,009 --> 00:36:02,239
(Flapping)

897
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,239
- Wash the clothes? Yes.
- Yes. Wash the clothes.

898
00:36:04,239 --> 00:36:05,310
- Of course.
- Really? How much?

899
00:36:05,310 --> 00:36:07,049
Gosh. He understood you perfectly.

900
00:36:07,049 --> 00:36:08,150
Five pieces.

901
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,310
- That's our list. Okay?
- I see. This is the price list.

902
00:36:10,420 --> 00:36:11,850
- Right. We should get them cleaned.
- Here.

903
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,549
Socks. I see.

904
00:36:13,549 --> 00:36:15,690
- It's nice that there's a price table.
- Pants.

905
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:17,520
- Pants.
- I see.

906
00:36:18,089 --> 00:36:20,089
- Do you wash them...
- We wash them.

907
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:22,460
in the river?

908
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,600
- No.
- You saw how people washed laundry.

909
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:26,460
We have a separate place.

910
00:36:27,130 --> 00:36:29,069
- Clean water?
- Okay.

911
00:36:29,069 --> 00:36:30,230
- Really?
- Thank you.

912
00:36:30,500 --> 00:36:32,270
- If you give me your clothes now,
- Now.

913
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:34,040
I'll give them back this evening.

914
00:36:34,040 --> 00:36:35,509
- This evening?
- This evening?

915
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:37,239
- Yes. Today.
- This evening?

916
00:36:38,179 --> 00:36:40,750
- I see.
- Hey, tomorrow afternoon is too late.

917
00:36:40,880 --> 00:36:42,409
No. He said we'd have them by tonight.

918
00:36:43,150 --> 00:36:44,619
(Realizing his mistake)

919
00:36:44,619 --> 00:36:47,020
- Maybe, around 7 p.m. or 8 p.m.
- His English is good.

920
00:36:47,020 --> 00:36:48,889
- Okay. No problem.
- Okay.

921
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,319
- Let's go.
- Okay.

922
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:52,319
- Thank you.
- He's cool about it.

923
00:36:52,319 --> 00:36:53,319
(He quickly leaves as he's embarrassed.)

924
00:36:55,989 --> 00:36:58,330
- Oh, no!
- What is it?

925
00:36:58,730 --> 00:36:59,960
Gosh, it's humid.

926
00:37:00,569 --> 00:37:01,900
Gosh, it's so humid.

927
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,670
What do we do?
This just doesn't make sense.

928
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:07,170
- This...
- I want to take a nap in a dry place.

929
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:08,810
What's wrong with this air conditioner?

930
00:37:09,670 --> 00:37:11,909
(I have to take action.)

931
00:37:12,580 --> 00:37:15,210
(While Kian84 takes a shower...)

932
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:18,480
The hotel we stayed in
didn't have the best conditions.

933
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,190
Everything was humid
like the blankets, pillows, and towels.

934
00:37:21,190 --> 00:37:24,319
So I talked to the owner
and asked him to change everything.

935
00:37:25,159 --> 00:37:27,659
We needed the room to be dry
for us to rest.

936
00:37:27,659 --> 00:37:29,690
- Nice.
- And the air conditioner...

937
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:31,330
was like a fan.

938
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:33,730
I asked him to change the mode,
so we got cool air.

939
00:37:33,730 --> 00:37:35,429
We got cool air from the air conditioner.

940
00:37:36,969 --> 00:37:38,199
Very cool.

941
00:37:38,469 --> 00:37:40,469
Very cold. Thank you so much.

942
00:37:40,469 --> 00:37:42,139
Okay. Thank you. I'll tip you.

943
00:37:42,139 --> 00:37:44,480
- Two hundred each. Thank you.
- Thank you.

944
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,610
Thank you. Namaste.

945
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,279
Okay. Thank you.

946
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,580
- Gosh. This is nice.
- Is it nice?

947
00:37:50,650 --> 00:37:52,619
Goodness.

948
00:37:52,619 --> 00:37:55,049
- How is it? Do you feel fresh now?
- This is nice.

949
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:56,190
This is great.

950
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:57,259
(He took a shower and is lying down
in a clean bed, so he's in paradise.)

951
00:37:57,460 --> 00:37:58,920
(Chuckling proudly)

952
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:01,230
Actually,

953
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:04,630
I briefly talked to the owner downstairs.

954
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:06,060
I asked him...

955
00:38:06,830 --> 00:38:09,230
how much tip I should give in India.
I asked him for an average amount.

956
00:38:09,730 --> 00:38:12,900
According to him,
200 rupees was the minimum.

957
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,710
But we could tip people as much as
we wanted if we had the money.

958
00:38:15,710 --> 00:38:18,339
- Is that so?
- But here's what I know for sure.

959
00:38:18,540 --> 00:38:20,509
I won't give tips to everyone.

960
00:38:20,509 --> 00:38:22,210
If I do that, people will swarm around me.

961
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:25,219
- So it has to go over the line for you.
- Yes.

962
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:28,290
It's not that, per se.
I just have a starting point.

963
00:38:28,290 --> 00:38:29,750
(He has a clear starting point.)

964
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:30,860
- I got it.
- Okay.

965
00:38:30,860 --> 00:38:32,719
- I'll take a nap.
- Okay.

966
00:38:32,719 --> 00:38:34,630
- He'll take a nap.
- A naptime.

967
00:38:34,630 --> 00:38:35,659
Goodnight.

968
00:38:37,860 --> 00:38:39,900
- Lights out for the nap.
- Time for a nap.

969
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,799
It's too hot in the afternoon.
We have to take a nap.

970
00:38:42,799 --> 00:38:44,170
It's like having a siesta.

971
00:38:44,299 --> 00:38:45,670
I bet he slept deep.

972
00:38:45,670 --> 00:38:46,670
(Sleeping soundly)

973
00:38:47,969 --> 00:38:51,409
(Dex takes a shower
while Kian84 is taking a nap.)

974
00:38:53,210 --> 00:38:55,080
(Changing into new clothes)

975
00:38:56,380 --> 00:38:59,420
(He gets the bag of laundry
and heads out.)

976
00:39:00,549 --> 00:39:01,790
He's diligent.

977
00:39:02,219 --> 00:39:03,389
Let's see.

978
00:39:03,750 --> 00:39:06,719
Master. Check, please.

979
00:39:07,089 --> 00:39:08,730
Our clothes.

980
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:09,960
- Okay.
- Okay.

981
00:39:10,929 --> 00:39:13,799
Okay. Our underwear and T-shirts.

982
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,130
(Fancy clothes)

983
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:17,000
You got my fancy clothes washed too.

984
00:39:17,699 --> 00:39:20,170
(He took out the flower shirt
for an occasion to dress up.)

985
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:22,869
(Sniffing)

986
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:25,580
(He brought this dirty laundry
all the way from Seoul.)

987
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,110
At what time
should I come and pick them up?

988
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:29,710
From 8 to 9 o'clock.

989
00:39:29,710 --> 00:39:31,619
- From 8 to 9 o'clock.
- Yes.

990
00:39:32,119 --> 00:39:35,190
- Okay. Thank you.
- He's a reliable partner.

991
00:39:36,619 --> 00:39:37,889
Gosh, it's 38°C.

992
00:39:45,860 --> 00:39:47,469
(In the meantime, monkeys
are playing in front of the lodging.)

993
00:39:47,469 --> 00:39:49,469
Right. There are a lot of monkeys.

994
00:39:49,469 --> 00:39:52,469
(In the meantime, monkeys
are playing in front of the lodging.)

995
00:39:54,339 --> 00:39:55,969
- They look cute in videos.
- How cute.

996
00:39:57,139 --> 00:39:59,239
(Creaking)

997
00:39:59,540 --> 00:40:00,779
(Startled)

998
00:40:02,279 --> 00:40:03,380
Come here.

999
00:40:03,380 --> 00:40:05,279
(Come here!)

1000
00:40:05,279 --> 00:40:06,520
Why are you picking a fight with them?

1001
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:07,549
Do you want food?

1002
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:11,520
Do we have any food?

1003
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,960
- Are you hungry?
- Do we have food?

1004
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,330
There's a monkey outside.

1005
00:40:17,330 --> 00:40:18,360
(He takes some snacks for the monkeys
and goes out.)

1006
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:20,100
Monkey.

1007
00:40:22,529 --> 00:40:23,699
Hello.

1008
00:40:25,299 --> 00:40:26,369
Come here.

1009
00:40:26,369 --> 00:40:27,670
(Luring the monkey with the snack)

1010
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,610
(Grabbing)

1011
00:40:30,369 --> 00:40:32,310
- Oh, no.
- Just take one.

1012
00:40:34,850 --> 00:40:35,949
(Approaching another monkey)

1013
00:40:35,949 --> 00:40:37,279
Come here. You have one too.

1014
00:40:38,549 --> 00:40:39,619
Here.

1015
00:40:42,089 --> 00:40:44,119
I guess this one has the highest rank.

1016
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:45,219
(Give us some too.)

1017
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:47,630
No.

1018
00:40:47,889 --> 00:40:49,630
(The monkey tries to snatch it.)

1019
00:40:49,630 --> 00:40:52,199
Gosh. Just have one.

1020
00:40:52,500 --> 00:40:53,799
I need to give it to other monkeys.

1021
00:40:56,029 --> 00:40:58,239
- Hey.
- So many of them swarmed around him.

1022
00:40:58,770 --> 00:41:00,909
Look at that.
It looks just like getting a massage.

1023
00:41:01,610 --> 00:41:03,069
(This irresistible man...)

1024
00:41:03,909 --> 00:41:05,139
This one looks strong.

1025
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:06,440
(draws people and animals too.)

1026
00:41:06,679 --> 00:41:08,009
Gosh, there's a baby monkey.

1027
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,580
It's a baby monkey.

1028
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:12,449
- Gosh.
- Gosh. So cute.

1029
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:15,549
Gosh. You must've been baptized too.

1030
00:41:15,549 --> 00:41:16,619
Hey. Darn it.

1031
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,520
The monkey took it.

1032
00:41:19,690 --> 00:41:21,389
(Ripping)

1033
00:41:21,589 --> 00:41:23,860
(Laughing)

1034
00:41:24,529 --> 00:41:25,929
Look at this punk.

1035
00:41:26,500 --> 00:41:28,429
(Munching)

1036
00:41:29,830 --> 00:41:31,770
(Creaking)

1037
00:41:34,040 --> 00:41:36,239
- Hey. Not there.
- No. Oh, no.

1038
00:41:36,239 --> 00:41:38,480
- Dex. Oh, no. What about Dex?
- Why did they go in there?

1039
00:41:45,279 --> 00:41:46,880
No!

1040
00:41:49,389 --> 00:41:51,319
(Dashing away)

1041
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,889
(He was about to go out.)

1042
00:41:53,889 --> 00:41:55,259
(Stopping)

1043
00:41:55,259 --> 00:41:57,600
- There were so many of them?
- There were more than I expected.

1044
00:41:57,600 --> 00:41:59,299
- Come here.
- It was a zoo.

1045
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,199
(He stays close to the wall
as he walks out.)

1046
00:42:03,199 --> 00:42:04,569
(On alert)

1047
00:42:04,839 --> 00:42:06,000
Let's go.

1048
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:09,610
- I found out later.
- They are so cute.

1049
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:11,339
- I fed them because they were cute.
- Yes.

1050
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:13,110
But don't do that. It's dangerous.

1051
00:42:13,339 --> 00:42:15,179
- A lot of people get bitten.
- The monkeys...

1052
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:16,449
- In India?
- Yes.

1053
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:18,219
- Be careful.
- Okay.

1054
00:42:19,049 --> 00:42:21,619
- Where are they going next?
<i>- Let's go</i>

1055
00:42:21,619 --> 00:42:23,989
We have to book train tickets.

1056
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:26,389
As a matter of fact, I did look into that.

1057
00:42:26,389 --> 00:42:27,690
Where we could reserve train tickets.

1058
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:30,630
We had to buy train tickets
from Varanasi to Delhi.

1059
00:42:30,630 --> 00:42:32,560
- To meet up with Pani Bottle.
- Yes, that's right.

1060
00:42:32,659 --> 00:42:34,500
(Last night,
they video called Pani Bottle.)

1061
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,429
You must meet me there.
I'll be arriving in Delhi.

1062
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:37,540
- Okay.
- Yes.

1063
00:42:37,969 --> 00:42:40,270
There will be a lot of travel agencies
around your lodging...

1064
00:42:40,270 --> 00:42:41,639
- in Varanasi.
- Okay.

1065
00:42:41,639 --> 00:42:44,940
Go and ask if there are any tickets left.

1066
00:42:44,940 --> 00:42:47,779
Just get on the train you want.
The train departing to Delhi.

1067
00:42:47,779 --> 00:42:48,980
- Okay. In two days.
- See you then.

1068
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,080
(They will meet up
with Pani Bottle in Delhi.)

1069
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:51,750
(They will meet up
with Pani Bottle in Delhi.)

1070
00:42:51,750 --> 00:42:55,150
You can buy the train tickets online too.

1071
00:42:55,150 --> 00:42:57,089
But it's complicated for foreigners
to buy them online.

1072
00:42:57,089 --> 00:42:59,219
- The travel agencies help you.
- It's better that way.

1073
00:42:59,219 --> 00:43:01,429
You just have to tell them
which class you want.

1074
00:43:01,429 --> 00:43:03,659
- In person.
- They do everything for you. It's easier.

1075
00:43:04,130 --> 00:43:05,529
Just follow me.

1076
00:43:05,759 --> 00:43:08,100
- Do you know what's crazy?
- Be careful.

1077
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:09,230
Watch out for the mines.

1078
00:43:09,569 --> 00:43:11,670
We're taking the path
that doesn't exist on Google.

1079
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:12,969
- Really?
- Yes.

1080
00:43:12,969 --> 00:43:14,610
The path to the restaurant
didn't show up either.

1081
00:43:14,610 --> 00:43:16,639
- Gosh.
- Be careful. What is it?

1082
00:43:16,639 --> 00:43:18,380
- Something fell on me.
- What is it?

1083
00:43:18,980 --> 00:43:20,380
- Hey, the monkey pooped!
- Come on!

1084
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:21,650
- The monkey pooped.
- Gosh.

1085
00:43:21,810 --> 00:43:23,310
(Screaming)

1086
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:24,880
- Hey, the monkey pooped!
- Come on!

1087
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,350
(The scream of a former soldier in UDT...)

1088
00:43:26,719 --> 00:43:29,250
(disrupts Varanasi.)

1089
00:43:30,089 --> 00:43:31,219
Come on.

1090
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,159
(Embarrassed)

1091
00:43:33,159 --> 00:43:34,730
What happened to the manly guy, Dex?

1092
00:43:34,730 --> 00:43:36,290
Come on. I had just taken a shower then.

1093
00:43:36,290 --> 00:43:38,929
- I'm not sure if they filmed the monkey.
- Gosh.

1094
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:40,460
I'm serious. It was so precise.

1095
00:43:40,830 --> 00:43:42,270
- The monkey's anus was...
- It... Okay.

1096
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:45,170
aiming at people
while watching them like this.

1097
00:43:45,170 --> 00:43:47,000
- Did the monkey do that on purpose?
- I was so shocked.

1098
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:48,569
- I'm sure the monkey aimed at Dex.
- Gosh. That's crazy.

1099
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:50,409
- Gosh. But...
- That pose helps your bowel movements.

1100
00:43:50,409 --> 00:43:51,739
- What is this?
- Gosh. Look.

1101
00:43:51,739 --> 00:43:53,810
The monkey is pooping up there.

1102
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:56,049
- This one.
- Look over there.

1103
00:43:56,049 --> 00:43:58,119
Look. It's over there. Didn't I tell you?

1104
00:43:58,119 --> 00:43:59,679
(Everyone, look at the monkey.)

1105
00:43:59,679 --> 00:44:02,790
Over there. The monkey
was sitting on that metal thing.

1106
00:44:02,790 --> 00:44:04,560
Gosh.
How could he poop right at that moment?

1107
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:05,889
- I want to go home.
- Let me see.

1108
00:44:05,889 --> 00:44:07,259
- Oh, no.
- Where...

1109
00:44:07,560 --> 00:44:09,230
- This is so annoying.
- I had a mental breakdown.

1110
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,489
- You must've gotten a reality check.
- Gosh.

1111
00:44:10,489 --> 00:44:11,699
(Dex, the former solider in UDT)

1112
00:44:11,699 --> 00:44:13,500
- This is it.
- He's getting the flag again.

1113
00:44:13,500 --> 00:44:15,670
- Stop using this clip.
- This is the famous clip.

1114
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,839
- Stop with the flag! Gosh.
- Stop that.

1115
00:44:17,839 --> 00:44:19,299
(A beast-like guy, full of masculinity)

1116
00:44:19,299 --> 00:44:20,909
That's useless.

1117
00:44:20,909 --> 00:44:22,369
(He showcased the beast-like class.)

1118
00:44:22,369 --> 00:44:23,610
Dex is so manly.

1119
00:44:23,610 --> 00:44:24,909
- I want to go home.
- Let me see.

1120
00:44:24,909 --> 00:44:25,980
Where...

1121
00:44:26,409 --> 00:44:27,880
- This is so annoying.
- Let me see.

1122
00:44:28,350 --> 00:44:30,110
- No.
- I just took a shower.

1123
00:44:30,480 --> 00:44:31,480
Wait.

1124
00:44:31,480 --> 00:44:33,549
- Where did it splatter?
- It just came down like this.

1125
00:44:33,980 --> 00:44:35,389
- It came down in one go.
- It fell on you?

1126
00:44:35,449 --> 00:44:37,119
(Contrary to the fuss he made,
only a drop hit his cap.)

1127
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:38,589
Right. It was only a drop.

1128
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:39,759
Come on.

1129
00:44:39,759 --> 00:44:42,429
Luckily, it must have been dry poop.

1130
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:45,360
- Is that supposed to make me feel better?
- So...

1131
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,630
Kian84 kept making it worse
when he talked to me.

1132
00:44:47,630 --> 00:44:49,000
- You're bad at comforting people.
- He's not good at that.

1133
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:53,000
If it was soft, it would have smeared.

1134
00:44:53,969 --> 00:44:55,839
- The powder?
- Yes, the powder.

1135
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:57,440
- I see.
- What is this?

1136
00:44:57,710 --> 00:44:59,810
Right. It's okay since it wasn't liquid.

1137
00:44:59,810 --> 00:45:01,909
I don't think it was poop.

1138
00:45:01,909 --> 00:45:04,080
- I think it was the dirt on the bottom.
- Is that so?

1139
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:06,679
The monkey was rubbing the bottom
on the rebar like this.

1140
00:45:06,679 --> 00:45:08,619
- The poop powder fell on you.
- The poop powder.

1141
00:45:08,819 --> 00:45:10,449
- What's on it?
- It's starting to attract flies.

1142
00:45:10,449 --> 00:45:11,719
- There are flies?
- Flies are sitting on it.

1143
00:45:11,719 --> 00:45:13,190
- Right. There were flies.
- I guess it was poop.

1144
00:45:13,489 --> 00:45:14,989
Gosh. I went to the Ganges today.

1145
00:45:14,989 --> 00:45:16,159
What's going on with me?

1146
00:45:16,159 --> 00:45:17,330
- It could've been worse.
- Right.

1147
00:45:17,330 --> 00:45:18,659
- It could've been worse.
- Okay.

1148
00:45:21,230 --> 00:45:22,630
- Gosh, the alley.
- We're almost there.

1149
00:45:22,630 --> 00:45:23,770
- It brings back such fond memories.
- Right.

1150
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:24,839
Hey, my friend.

1151
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:27,469
- You didn't rip me off.
- Thank you.

1152
00:45:27,469 --> 00:45:29,210
The bag is very useful.

1153
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,869
He's like a local.

1154
00:45:30,869 --> 00:45:32,239
- You bought it from him?
- Yes.

1155
00:45:32,880 --> 00:45:35,250
He didn't rip me off.

1156
00:45:36,679 --> 00:45:37,750
Where is it? Is it here?

1157
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,580
After this, we can make a left turn.

1158
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:41,350
I think this is the place.

1159
00:45:41,650 --> 00:45:43,819
It was one of the activities
on my bucket list.

1160
00:45:43,819 --> 00:45:47,560
I want to stand on the moving train.
I want to experience that.

1161
00:45:47,929 --> 00:45:49,290
But I'm not sure if I can do it...

1162
00:45:49,290 --> 00:45:51,259
because I don't know how the train looks.

1163
00:45:51,259 --> 00:45:54,369
I had this fantasy of taking the train...

1164
00:45:54,929 --> 00:45:58,639
- with the locals in India.
- Okay.

1165
00:45:58,900 --> 00:46:01,139
- I was looking at the map. Hello.
- Namaste.

1166
00:46:01,139 --> 00:46:02,569
(They enter the travel agency
to reserve the train tickets.)

1167
00:46:02,770 --> 00:46:04,779
We're going to Delhi tomorrow.

1168
00:46:04,940 --> 00:46:07,279
So we want tickets.

1169
00:46:07,679 --> 00:46:09,610
How long does it take to arrive in Delhi?

1170
00:46:09,610 --> 00:46:11,520
- Twelve hours.
- Twelve?

1171
00:46:11,520 --> 00:46:13,520
- It was that far?
- Twelve hours?

1172
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,319
- Yes.
- Okay.

1173
00:46:15,319 --> 00:46:17,719
I will check which train is available.

1174
00:46:17,719 --> 00:46:19,719
- Eleven.
- Eleven.

1175
00:46:20,659 --> 00:46:22,589
Only one train.

1176
00:46:22,589 --> 00:46:24,929
The name is Shramjeevi Express.

1177
00:46:25,400 --> 00:46:26,730
Ramjeevi Express.

1178
00:46:26,730 --> 00:46:28,029
- Shramjeevi.
- Ramjeevi.

1179
00:46:28,029 --> 00:46:29,469
- Shramjeevi.
- Shramjeevi.

1180
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:30,630
And the departure time...

1181
00:46:30,630 --> 00:46:32,400
- They need to know the name.
- is three...

1182
00:46:33,469 --> 00:46:34,540
twelve.

1183
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:36,909
Departing from Varanasi.

1184
00:46:36,909 --> 00:46:39,639
He wrote everything down,
so it was easier for us to understand him.

1185
00:46:39,639 --> 00:46:41,949
Even if we didn't speak English,
he still helped us like this.

1186
00:46:41,949 --> 00:46:43,110
He's kind.

1187
00:46:43,549 --> 00:46:45,179
- I see. We arrive at 4:40 a.m.
- In Delhi.

1188
00:46:45,449 --> 00:46:47,250
- Finished in Delhi.
- Yes.

1189
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:49,250
- Okay.
- Delhi is the last stop.

1190
00:46:49,250 --> 00:46:51,759
We want to change...

1191
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:53,259
(Stuttering)

1192
00:46:53,259 --> 00:46:54,889
- Change the class.
- The class.

1193
00:46:54,889 --> 00:46:55,929
Which class?

1194
00:46:55,929 --> 00:46:58,159
Okay. Can I use the pen?

1195
00:46:58,159 --> 00:46:59,860
We want...

1196
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,699
the rooftop,

1197
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,369
economy,

1198
00:47:04,670 --> 00:47:05,770
and...

1199
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:07,770
- first class.
- I understand.

1200
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:10,170
- But this is important.
- First class.

1201
00:47:10,170 --> 00:47:12,610
A very short time for the rooftop.

1202
00:47:13,009 --> 00:47:17,210
A very short time
for the rooftop and economy.

1203
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:19,080
- Long time for first class.
- Gosh, seriously.

1204
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:21,350
- You were accommodating to me.
- I understand.

1205
00:47:21,350 --> 00:47:22,750
This train...

1206
00:47:22,750 --> 00:47:24,759
- You're at least trying.
- For this train,

1207
00:47:24,759 --> 00:47:28,429
only silver and SL classes are available.

1208
00:47:28,730 --> 00:47:31,060
The rest of the classes are not available.

1209
00:47:31,060 --> 00:47:34,000
- Back then, we had to buy tickets...
- Is SL class lower?

1210
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:36,230
- for the train that left the next day.
- Right.

1211
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:38,040
All the good seats were sold out.

1212
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:39,799
Personally,
when I first got on the train in India,

1213
00:47:39,799 --> 00:47:41,670
it felt like taking the CSAT.

1214
00:47:41,670 --> 00:47:42,909
- Why?
- Here's why.

1215
00:47:42,909 --> 00:47:45,080
A lot of people made reservations.

1216
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,509
- So I wasn't sure if I could get a seat.
- Right.

1217
00:47:47,509 --> 00:47:48,909
- It's tough.
- Later,

1218
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,750
they give out numbers for the waitlist.

1219
00:47:51,009 --> 00:47:52,949
You have to go and check your number
at the station.

1220
00:47:52,949 --> 00:47:54,350
Back then, they put up papers.

1221
00:47:54,589 --> 00:47:55,819
- So...
- Getting on the train was no joke.

1222
00:47:55,819 --> 00:47:57,589
it was like taking the CSAT
back in the days.

1223
00:47:57,589 --> 00:47:59,759
I had to check if I could get on the train
or not at the station.

1224
00:47:59,759 --> 00:48:02,389
I couldn't get on the train
if my reservation number wasn't on it.

1225
00:48:03,330 --> 00:48:05,929
Can we stay in the SL class...

1226
00:48:05,929 --> 00:48:08,699
- and then change to the rooftop?
- SL class.

1227
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,900
So it's an upper bed.

1228
00:48:11,569 --> 00:48:12,839
- Okay.
- An upper bed.

1229
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:14,369
No rooftop. An upper bed.

1230
00:48:14,369 --> 00:48:16,110
- An upper bed? What's that?
- Yes.

1231
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:18,779
No chairs?

1232
00:48:19,080 --> 00:48:20,210
No chairs.

1233
00:48:20,779 --> 00:48:22,250
- I see.
- Beds.

1234
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:23,810
- One bed, two beds,
- Okay.

1235
00:48:23,810 --> 00:48:26,219
- and 3 beds. And 1 and 2.
- That's why there are no chairs.

1236
00:48:26,219 --> 00:48:28,190
- I understand.
- Eight beds.

1237
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:32,219
I thought we were going to sleep
on a red carpet like ferries in Korea.

1238
00:48:32,219 --> 00:48:33,290
I thought so too.

1239
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:35,730
- It's like taking vessels.
- Yes.

1240
00:48:35,730 --> 00:48:37,960
- Okay.
- The compartments must be divided.

1241
00:48:37,960 --> 00:48:40,659
We can get some fresh air on the rooftop.

1242
00:48:40,659 --> 00:48:42,100
And we can come down and sleep
when we're done.

1243
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:43,199
- Yes.
- Okay.

1244
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:44,799
Okay. That's the best.

1245
00:48:45,400 --> 00:48:46,739
We buy tickets.

1246
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:49,310
(If we buy tickets...)

1247
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:51,179
Our area is...

1248
00:48:52,210 --> 00:48:53,310
clear?

1249
00:48:53,310 --> 00:48:55,049
Your bed...

1250
00:48:55,049 --> 00:48:57,009
- Other people can't use it.
- How did he understand Dex?

1251
00:48:57,009 --> 00:48:58,380
- They can't use it?
- No.

1252
00:48:58,380 --> 00:48:59,679
- Really?
- He's amazing.

1253
00:48:59,679 --> 00:49:02,290
- Only you can sit and sleep.
- Okay.

1254
00:49:02,290 --> 00:49:03,549
Your bed only.

1255
00:49:03,819 --> 00:49:06,520
I'll give you the ticket.

1256
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:09,389
- So it has your bed number.
- The bed number?

1257
00:49:09,389 --> 00:49:10,529
- I see. The number.
- Yes.

1258
00:49:10,529 --> 00:49:11,659
- There's a number?
- Yes.

1259
00:49:11,929 --> 00:49:14,569
- Then it's good.
- We were relieved after hearing that.

1260
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:18,199
"Only you can sit and sleep on your bed."

1261
00:49:18,199 --> 00:49:21,069
I thought the 12-hour train ride
wouldn't be that bad.

1262
00:49:21,069 --> 00:49:23,569
Kim Jin Young.

1263
00:49:24,139 --> 00:49:26,409
- Your name is Jin Young?
- Yes.

1264
00:49:26,409 --> 00:49:28,210
- You were a Kim?
- I was a Kim.

1265
00:49:28,210 --> 00:49:29,380
I'm a Kim too.

1266
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:31,150
Then you're Kim Kian?

1267
00:49:31,150 --> 00:49:33,619
No. That's my nickname.

1268
00:49:33,619 --> 00:49:35,020
Then are you Kim Dex?

1269
00:49:35,719 --> 00:49:37,619
(Kim Dex and Kim Kian)

1270
00:49:37,619 --> 00:49:39,960
- Kian suits you really well.
- Which Kim clan are you?

1271
00:49:40,219 --> 00:49:41,489
- The Gimhae Kim.
- The Gimhae Kim?

1272
00:49:41,489 --> 00:49:42,860
- What about you?
- The Gyeongju Kim.

1273
00:49:42,860 --> 00:49:44,190
(Dex's intellectual level is dropping.)

1274
00:49:44,190 --> 00:49:45,230
All right.

1275
00:49:45,799 --> 00:49:50,699
It's 440 rupees
and 70 rupees on top of that.

1276
00:49:50,699 --> 00:49:52,469
- It's not that expensive.
- Okay.

1277
00:49:52,469 --> 00:49:53,500
Here.

1278
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:56,170
It's going better than I thought.

1279
00:49:56,170 --> 00:49:57,670
- This is your ticket.
- Okay.

1280
00:49:57,670 --> 00:49:58,880
- Yes.
- Namaste.

1281
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,139
- Namaste.
- Namaste.

1282
00:50:00,139 --> 00:50:01,210
Thank you.

1283
00:50:04,310 --> 00:50:05,319
Hey. By the way,

1284
00:50:05,880 --> 00:50:08,290
- This isn't easy.
- given the price of the train ticket,

1285
00:50:08,420 --> 00:50:09,790
we should be frugal.

1286
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:11,389
- Why?
- We've been too generous.

1287
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:13,489
- Right? You felt that now. Right?
- I mean...

1288
00:50:13,489 --> 00:50:15,060
- The ten-something-hour train ride...
- That was a pricey lesson.

1289
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:16,659
- costs about 500 rupees.
- Seriously.

1290
00:50:16,659 --> 00:50:19,600
We gave 500 rupees per person
for a mediocre massage.

1291
00:50:19,600 --> 00:50:20,699
It's okay as long as you realized that.

1292
00:50:20,699 --> 00:50:23,029
- The massage taught him a lot.
- That's good then.

1293
00:50:23,469 --> 00:50:26,869
I was really grateful that
he told me that himself.

1294
00:50:27,100 --> 00:50:28,369
As I was younger,

1295
00:50:28,369 --> 00:50:31,210
I couldn't tell him how to spend money.

1296
00:50:31,210 --> 00:50:33,380
- No. But you know,
- He told me that himself.

1297
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,980
I was angry at that moment.

1298
00:50:36,350 --> 00:50:39,020
- Because you spent money recklessly?
- Yes.

1299
00:50:39,020 --> 00:50:41,219
(A belated realization)

1300
00:50:41,650 --> 00:50:44,020
- Then...
- We have some time before the wedding.

1301
00:50:44,020 --> 00:50:46,389
We're going to a wedding.

1302
00:50:46,619 --> 00:50:48,130
- Let's buy some clothes.
- I see.

1303
00:50:48,330 --> 00:50:49,489
- Clothes?
- To be polite.

1304
00:50:49,489 --> 00:50:50,489
Right.

1305
00:50:50,489 --> 00:50:52,199
(He met a couple yesterday on a boat.)

1306
00:50:53,799 --> 00:50:57,940
(And Kian84 got
a wedding invitation from them.)

1307
00:50:57,940 --> 00:50:59,900
- That's an interesting way to meet.
- Gosh, that's so fascinating.

1308
00:50:59,900 --> 00:51:01,739
(We'll be happy if you come.)

1309
00:51:02,210 --> 00:51:06,139
(He somehow ended up
accepting the invitation.)

1310
00:51:07,279 --> 00:51:08,750
Hey, they invited me to a wedding.

1311
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:12,420
(He told Dex that
they had to go to the wedding.)

1312
00:51:12,420 --> 00:51:13,420
(That was random.)

1313
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:17,219
(Dex wants to be respectful
at the wedding.)

1314
00:51:17,449 --> 00:51:18,520
- Clothes?
- Yes.

1315
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:19,920
To be polite.

1316
00:51:20,389 --> 00:51:23,190
You may think I don't care about fashion,
but I care a lot about it.

1317
00:51:23,489 --> 00:51:25,199
- You must be lying.
- I'm serious.

1318
00:51:25,429 --> 00:51:26,730
Should we just look around?

1319
00:51:26,730 --> 00:51:28,500
- Look.
- We have time anyway. Let's browse.

1320
00:51:28,500 --> 00:51:29,929
- Fine. Go.
- Okay. Let's go.

1321
00:51:30,130 --> 00:51:31,799
(Let's see.)

1322
00:51:32,069 --> 00:51:33,500
You know what you like.

1323
00:51:33,500 --> 00:51:35,369
I'm the Fashion King.

1324
00:51:35,369 --> 00:51:37,239
You have a strong sense
of your own fashion.

1325
00:51:37,239 --> 00:51:38,310
Of course. I do.

1326
00:51:38,310 --> 00:51:39,980
I see. You'll buy clothes
to be a proper wedding guest?

1327
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:41,009
Yes.

1328
00:51:41,009 --> 00:51:43,409
This is the main stage of Varanasi.

1329
00:51:43,409 --> 00:51:45,150
Right. I took that path.

1330
00:51:45,150 --> 00:51:46,179
- You know, right?
- Yes.

1331
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:49,920
When you go there, you can experience
how it feels to be a celebrity.

1332
00:51:50,119 --> 00:51:51,460
- They all want to take a photo with you.
- It's...

1333
00:51:51,460 --> 00:51:52,659
- Really?
- Yes.

1334
00:51:52,659 --> 00:51:53,960
- They didn't ask me for photos.
- Is that so?

1335
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:55,360
- No.
- But you know,

1336
00:51:55,360 --> 00:51:56,889
it might have been just yesterday.

1337
00:51:57,330 --> 00:51:59,159
(Scanning)

1338
00:51:59,159 --> 00:52:00,730
- Over there.
- There it is.

1339
00:52:01,199 --> 00:52:02,569
- Right?
- It's over there.

1340
00:52:02,969 --> 00:52:04,270
Should we go and check out men's clothes?

1341
00:52:04,529 --> 00:52:07,239
When you attend weddings
as guests in India,

1342
00:52:07,239 --> 00:52:08,810
you can't wear short-sleeved shirts.

1343
00:52:08,810 --> 00:52:10,069
- Long pants and long-sleeved shirts...
- Right.

1344
00:52:10,069 --> 00:52:11,339
are the basic outfit for guests.

1345
00:52:11,339 --> 00:52:13,310
- They look expensive, right?
- They do. Let's ask.

1346
00:52:13,540 --> 00:52:14,779
- Namaste.
- Hello.

1347
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:16,909
This?

1348
00:52:17,650 --> 00:52:19,819
- This one is neat.
- I think this one looks the best.

1349
00:52:20,449 --> 00:52:22,089
- This. Five.
- This?

1350
00:52:22,089 --> 00:52:24,150
(The outfits for the Indian wedding)

1351
00:52:25,460 --> 00:52:27,560
- You guys look nice.
- We spent a lot of money again.

1352
00:52:28,589 --> 00:52:29,690
This one.

1353
00:52:29,690 --> 00:52:32,929
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1354
00:52:32,929 --> 00:52:34,299
(Bye.)

1355
00:52:35,500 --> 00:52:37,130
It's night already.

1356
00:52:37,130 --> 00:52:39,299
It said the wedding started at 8 p.m.

1357
00:52:39,299 --> 00:52:40,670
That was around 6 p.m.

1358
00:52:40,670 --> 00:52:42,469
- You had two hours left.
- What's he doing?

1359
00:52:42,469 --> 00:52:45,210
It was really hot.
I wanted to eat ice cream.

1360
00:52:45,880 --> 00:52:47,839
- Kian84, what are you doing?
- Hey, eat this.

1361
00:52:47,839 --> 00:52:49,380
- Have ice cream. I bought it.
- Ice cream?

1362
00:52:51,250 --> 00:52:52,380
(It cools down the heat of the night.)

1363
00:52:52,380 --> 00:52:54,679
The ice cream was really good.

1364
00:52:54,679 --> 00:52:55,750
How did it taste?

1365
00:52:55,750 --> 00:52:58,219
It tasted like yogurt with a sour note.

1366
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:01,690
It washes away the heat.

1367
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,630
Do you think 30 dollars would be enough?

1368
00:53:05,299 --> 00:53:06,500
(He's wondering how much
he should give the couple.)

1369
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,630
- Wouldn't that be more than enough?
- Right?

1370
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:10,000
Coming up with an amount
for the cash gift is hard.

1371
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:11,270
I don't think they will come...

1372
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,199
- to our weddings and give us cash gifts.
- Right.

1373
00:53:13,540 --> 00:53:15,469
- We're givers here.
- Right.

1374
00:53:15,469 --> 00:53:17,509
Let's think of it
as paying for our meals there.

1375
00:53:18,310 --> 00:53:19,380
Wait.

1376
00:53:20,009 --> 00:53:22,009
So 500 rupees is 8 dollars.

1377
00:53:22,250 --> 00:53:23,279
Eight times four...

1378
00:53:23,549 --> 00:53:24,819
(How much congratulatory money
is reasonable?)

1379
00:53:24,819 --> 00:53:26,150
- So...
- About...

1380
00:53:26,150 --> 00:53:28,589
- how about 2,000 rupees each?
- We can pay 2,000 rupees each.

1381
00:53:29,150 --> 00:53:30,389
Two thousand rupees
is less than 30 dollars.

1382
00:53:30,389 --> 00:53:31,420
Eight...

1383
00:53:31,420 --> 00:53:33,190
<i>Eight times 1 is 8, 8 times 2 is 16</i>

1384
00:53:33,190 --> 00:53:35,429
<i>Eight times 3 is 24, 8 times 4 is 32</i>

1385
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:37,889
Eight times 4 is 32? No.

1386
00:53:38,900 --> 00:53:40,900
- Eight times 3 is...
- Eight times 4 is 32.

1387
00:53:41,060 --> 00:53:42,830
No, it's not. 8 times 3 is...

1388
00:53:43,529 --> 00:53:45,699
But 8 times 4 is 32. 8 times 3 is 24.

1389
00:53:45,699 --> 00:53:46,699
Eight times 2 is 16.

1390
00:53:47,299 --> 00:53:48,839
Eight times 2 is 16, 8 times...

1391
00:53:50,739 --> 00:53:52,239
Eight times 3 is 24.

1392
00:53:52,310 --> 00:53:54,949
(I said so.)

1393
00:53:55,009 --> 00:53:56,949
What's wrong with you, Kian84?

1394
00:53:57,350 --> 00:54:00,080
- Eight times 4 is...
- I thought it was wrong for a minute.

1395
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:01,619
I hate this kind of me.

1396
00:54:01,790 --> 00:54:04,389
- Eight times 3 is 24, right?
- I'm slowly becoming dumb.

1397
00:54:04,389 --> 00:54:06,319
(Then how much should we pay?)

1398
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,690
- Eight...
- Let's each pay 2,000 rupees.

1399
00:54:08,690 --> 00:54:10,290
- Two thousand rupees?
- Yes. 2,000 rupees.

1400
00:54:10,290 --> 00:54:11,759
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

1401
00:54:11,759 --> 00:54:13,730
(Heading to the wedding)

1402
00:54:14,159 --> 00:54:15,529
Should we take a rickshaw?

1403
00:54:15,529 --> 00:54:16,969
The rickshaw sounds nice.

1404
00:54:17,969 --> 00:54:19,270
- Okay, driver.
- Hey.

1405
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:21,339
We...

1406
00:54:21,710 --> 00:54:23,839
are here, and we will stay here.

1407
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,080
- Can you go there?
- Yes.

1408
00:54:25,080 --> 00:54:26,779
- Do you have GPS?
- Yes.

1409
00:54:26,779 --> 00:54:28,150
- The drivers have gathered.
- Right.

1410
00:54:28,150 --> 00:54:30,509
One, two, three, four, five, six,
seven drivers.

1411
00:54:30,509 --> 00:54:32,449
- They come within seconds.
- Area name.

1412
00:54:32,449 --> 00:54:34,420
- Area name? This.
- Area name? This.

1413
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,889
Ambika Patika.

1414
00:54:36,889 --> 00:54:38,049
Ambika Patika.

1415
00:54:38,049 --> 00:54:41,259
Rather than using GPS,
they use the area name to find the place.

1416
00:54:41,259 --> 00:54:43,730
- Yes.
- Let's go.

1417
00:54:43,989 --> 00:54:45,900
- How much?
- Five hundred.

1418
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:47,259
- "Five hundred?"
- "Five hundred?"

1419
00:54:47,259 --> 00:54:49,569
From here to there,

1420
00:54:49,569 --> 00:54:51,369
- it's 500?
- Yes, 500.

1421
00:54:51,369 --> 00:54:52,369
- Okay.
- Finish?

1422
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:53,440
Finish.

1423
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:55,440
- Two people, 500?
- Okay.

1424
00:54:55,440 --> 00:54:58,279
- Okay.
- Dex is good at bargaining.

1425
00:54:58,279 --> 00:55:01,009
After learning a lesson from the massage,

1426
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:03,449
it was best to make the price clear
at first.

1427
00:55:03,449 --> 00:55:05,080
- Yes.
- Totally.

1428
00:55:05,080 --> 00:55:08,219
Dex uses two words to bargain.

1429
00:55:08,219 --> 00:55:10,190
- What is it?
- Finish and enough.

1430
00:55:10,949 --> 00:55:11,960
(Just 2 words are enough.)

1431
00:55:11,960 --> 00:55:14,089
- He bargains with those two words.
- Yes.

1432
00:55:14,089 --> 00:55:16,560
- I like "finish."
- Finish. Enough.

1433
00:55:16,560 --> 00:55:19,360
Remember those two words when bargaining.

1434
00:55:19,360 --> 00:55:21,429
- Finish. Enough.
- Finish.

1435
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:23,429
(Please repeat after them.)

1436
00:55:23,429 --> 00:55:25,299
- Finish. Enough.
- Finish. Enough.

1437
00:55:26,239 --> 00:55:27,770
Why are we repeating him?

1438
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,810
- To memorize it.
- It's just natural.

1439
00:55:29,810 --> 00:55:32,009
- We could go to India one day.
- Of course.

1440
00:55:32,110 --> 00:55:33,339
Let's move.

1441
00:55:33,339 --> 00:55:34,710
(Going to the wedding)

1442
00:55:34,710 --> 00:55:36,480
Oh, yes.

1443
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:37,880
What kind of songs do you like?

1444
00:55:38,009 --> 00:55:39,920
Me? NewJeans.

1445
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,150
NewJeans.

1446
00:55:41,179 --> 00:55:42,650
(NewJeans?)

1447
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:43,949
- "How do I get to Hongdae?"
<i>- Attention</i>

1448
00:55:43,949 --> 00:55:45,060
You know it, right?

1449
00:55:45,060 --> 00:55:47,060
- "How do I get to Hongdae?"
- I can get there in seconds.

1450
00:55:47,060 --> 00:55:48,989
"Hype Boy by NewJeans," is the answer.

1451
00:55:49,489 --> 00:55:50,489
I like "Attention."

1452
00:55:50,489 --> 00:55:51,759
"Hype Boy by NewJeans" comes after...

1453
00:55:51,759 --> 00:55:53,600
"How do I get to Hongdae?"
Don't you know it?

1454
00:55:53,799 --> 00:55:54,969
There's something like that?

1455
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:57,830
There's something like that?

1456
00:55:57,830 --> 00:55:59,299
(Screaming)

1457
00:55:59,500 --> 00:56:00,969
What? Something like that exists?

1458
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:04,170
- Do you know what it is?
- Yes. It was trending for a while.

1459
00:56:04,170 --> 00:56:05,540
If you ask someone passing by,

1460
00:56:05,540 --> 00:56:06,839
"How do I get to Hongdae?"

1461
00:56:06,839 --> 00:56:08,449
They leave after saying,
"Hype Boy by NewJeans."

1462
00:56:08,449 --> 00:56:10,549
- How do you know that?
<i>- And I</i>

1463
00:56:10,549 --> 00:56:11,549
You're 40 years old.

1464
00:56:11,549 --> 00:56:13,319
I'm Generation MZ.

1465
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:14,719
- I'm AOMZ.
- He's a social butterfly.

1466
00:56:14,719 --> 00:56:16,719
You should age well.
That doesn't suit you.

1467
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:18,989
It was all over social media.

1468
00:56:18,989 --> 00:56:20,790
- Is that so?
- What about you, Do Yeon?

1469
00:56:20,989 --> 00:56:22,429
I found out a few days ago.

1470
00:56:22,429 --> 00:56:24,730
When I was asked the question,
I said to take line two.

1471
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,969
"Line two takes you to Hongdae."

1472
00:56:28,969 --> 00:56:30,529
"Hype Boy by NewJeans."

1473
00:56:30,529 --> 00:56:32,000
"Hi for You?" How come?

1474
00:56:32,000 --> 00:56:33,969
You say, "Hype Boy by NewJeans."

1475
00:56:33,969 --> 00:56:35,639
- Why?
- It's just a meme. Memorize it.

1476
00:56:35,639 --> 00:56:37,940
Only then am I... Is that so?

1477
00:56:37,940 --> 00:56:40,080
- That's the meme.
- Gosh.

1478
00:56:40,139 --> 00:56:41,679
- Let's practice.
- Okay.

1479
00:56:41,679 --> 00:56:42,880
(Checking if he got it)

1480
00:56:42,880 --> 00:56:43,980
Let's do it.

1481
00:56:44,310 --> 00:56:45,580
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

1482
00:56:45,580 --> 00:56:46,779
"How do I get to Hongdae?"

1483
00:56:46,779 --> 00:56:48,319
"Hi for You by NewJeans."

1484
00:56:48,319 --> 00:56:49,520
"Hi for You."

1485
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:51,619
(Laughing)

1486
00:56:51,619 --> 00:56:52,989
Is that how it goes?

1487
00:56:52,989 --> 00:56:54,020
(The dance is necessary.)

1488
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:56,290
This is it, Kian84.

1489
00:56:56,290 --> 00:56:57,290
Gosh, I...

1490
00:56:57,290 --> 00:56:59,900
(Learning the latest fad from Dex95)

1491
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:02,199
(Singing)

1492
00:57:02,199 --> 00:57:03,830
(Twirling)

1493
00:57:05,139 --> 00:57:08,139
Going to the wedding
has made you two excited.

1494
00:57:08,469 --> 00:57:09,710
Let's go!

1495
00:57:09,710 --> 00:57:11,739
(After boosting up their energy,)

1496
00:57:11,739 --> 00:57:13,440
Gosh, this feels nice.

1497
00:57:13,440 --> 00:57:16,049
(they're off with high spirits.)

1498
00:57:17,310 --> 00:57:20,449
- Ever since we got on this rickshaw,
- Yes?

1499
00:57:20,449 --> 00:57:22,889
- we moved about 20m.
- Yes, 20m.

1500
00:57:22,889 --> 00:57:24,719
Gosh, look at the road.

1501
00:57:25,060 --> 00:57:27,960
None of the cars can move right now.

1502
00:57:28,119 --> 00:57:30,190
I can even touch the car.

1503
00:57:30,190 --> 00:57:32,960
- Please wipe the headlight.
- Should I wipe it?

1504
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:35,069
Like this? The headlight.

1505
00:57:35,699 --> 00:57:37,170
- Gosh.
- Gosh.

1506
00:57:38,270 --> 00:57:40,100
Just look at the road.

1507
00:57:40,100 --> 00:57:41,440
(People pass through the gaps.)

1508
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:43,369
Bolivia was nothing
compared to this place.

1509
00:57:43,369 --> 00:57:44,369
How come?

1510
00:57:44,369 --> 00:57:47,139
Cars passed each other with a slight gap
in between.

1511
00:57:47,139 --> 00:57:49,250
But here, cars pass each other
with barely any gap.

1512
00:57:49,850 --> 00:57:53,250
(He has already experienced
Bolivia's traffic congestion.)

1513
00:57:54,449 --> 00:57:55,889
(Enraged)

1514
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,319
(Cutting in)

1515
00:57:57,489 --> 00:58:00,489
(All 3 cars are enraged.)

1516
00:58:00,489 --> 00:58:03,860
The drivers in South America were furious.

1517
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:05,360
But in India,

1518
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:07,659
the drivers didn't get angry.

1519
00:58:07,659 --> 00:58:10,400
They were very chill
about minor collisions.

1520
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,199
- It's their everyday life.
- Yes.

1521
00:58:12,369 --> 00:58:14,569
- That, and the cars bump into each other.
- Yes.

1522
00:58:15,639 --> 00:58:16,639
(Honking)

1523
00:58:16,810 --> 00:58:17,940
Calm down.

1524
00:58:20,139 --> 00:58:23,480
(He finds a gap.)

1525
00:58:24,049 --> 00:58:25,750
(We're passing through.)

1526
00:58:27,719 --> 00:58:29,920
(An order in disorder)

1527
00:58:30,989 --> 00:58:32,520
The school bus on the other side...

1528
00:58:32,520 --> 00:58:34,259
is trying to crush us to death.

1529
00:58:34,420 --> 00:58:35,889
No, don't.

1530
00:58:36,230 --> 00:58:37,860
- On the other side, this car is also...
- What?

1531
00:58:37,860 --> 00:58:39,759
- trying to crush us...
- They just squeeze in.

1532
00:58:39,759 --> 00:58:41,500
- to death.
- That's risky.

1533
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:44,600
- Us... Hurry up!
- Save us!

1534
00:58:44,699 --> 00:58:46,600
They almost sandwiched us.

1535
00:58:47,540 --> 00:58:48,739
We almost died.

1536
00:58:48,909 --> 00:58:51,940
Even if a car hits me,
I think I'll be cool about it now.

1537
00:58:51,940 --> 00:58:52,980
(Honking)

1538
00:58:53,380 --> 00:58:55,449
(Honking everywhere)

1539
00:58:55,449 --> 00:58:56,850
That was tough.

1540
00:58:57,509 --> 00:58:59,449
It's surely wearing us out.

1541
00:58:59,449 --> 00:59:00,549
Yes. Gosh.

1542
00:59:00,549 --> 00:59:01,750
(Exhausted within minutes)

1543
00:59:02,449 --> 00:59:04,020
Invited yesterday,

1544
00:59:04,020 --> 00:59:05,690
- we're heading...
- Yes.

1545
00:59:05,690 --> 00:59:07,020
to the wedding with excitement.

1546
00:59:07,020 --> 00:59:09,389
I wonder
what India's wedding culture is like.

1547
00:59:09,389 --> 00:59:12,199
I heard weddings were held for three days.

1548
00:59:12,360 --> 00:59:13,929
- The wedding?
- Yes.

1549
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,630
They party day and night for three days.

1550
00:59:17,869 --> 00:59:21,170
(On the day he arrived in Varanasi,
he witnessed a wedding party.)

1551
00:59:24,310 --> 00:59:28,110
(The groom is in the wedding carriage.)

1552
00:59:29,250 --> 00:59:31,210
(Amazed)

1553
00:59:31,949 --> 00:59:33,380
- I can't wait.
- Me, too.

1554
00:59:33,949 --> 00:59:35,389
It really looks fun.

1555
00:59:35,389 --> 00:59:38,460
- Isn't it literally Bollywood?
- Totally, like a movie.

1556
00:59:38,460 --> 00:59:40,589
- Like they dance in groups.
- A group dance.

1557
00:59:40,819 --> 00:59:42,029
Is this the place?

1558
00:59:42,489 --> 00:59:44,659
- Gosh.
- We're finally here.

1559
00:59:44,659 --> 00:59:46,659
- Okay. Thank you.
- Okay.

1560
00:59:46,659 --> 00:59:48,000
This is the place.

1561
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:50,429
- Gosh.
- It's about to start.

1562
00:59:51,199 --> 00:59:52,569
- It's good that you went.
- I wonder...

1563
00:59:52,569 --> 00:59:53,799
what India's wedding is like.

1564
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:54,940
- It's more like a club.
- I've been...

1565
00:59:54,940 --> 00:59:57,639
to many weddings here and there in Korea.

1566
00:59:57,639 --> 00:59:59,639
- But an Indian wedding is...
- It must feel special.

1567
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:00,710
Thank you.

1568
01:00:00,980 --> 01:00:02,549
The extravagance really surprised me.

1569
01:00:03,880 --> 01:00:06,020
We finally arrived at the wedding.

1570
01:00:06,219 --> 01:00:09,190
"The small fruits became one,"

1571
01:00:09,549 --> 01:00:10,920
"and we have become a couple."

1572
01:00:11,190 --> 01:00:14,360
There are soldiers here
with spears, Kian84.

1573
01:00:14,790 --> 01:00:16,759
(The soldiers with spears
guard the entrance.)

1574
01:00:16,759 --> 01:00:18,900
In Korea, the groom and his parents...

1575
01:00:18,900 --> 01:00:20,429
greet the guests at the entrance.

1576
01:00:20,429 --> 01:00:21,730
- Yes.
- That's right.

1577
01:00:21,730 --> 01:00:22,900
But there are soldiers here.

1578
01:00:25,100 --> 01:00:26,969
So it started at 8 p.m. sharp.

1579
01:00:27,339 --> 01:00:28,710
Gosh.

1580
01:00:29,770 --> 01:00:32,779
- Ki! How are you?
- How are you?

1581
01:00:32,779 --> 01:00:35,009
- Namaste. Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

1582
01:00:35,210 --> 01:00:36,810
- My friend.
- My gosh.

1583
01:00:36,810 --> 01:00:39,219
- They invited you two.
- Yes.

1584
01:00:39,679 --> 01:00:41,719
This is my brother.

1585
01:00:41,719 --> 01:00:44,089
- Yes.
- This is my brother.

1586
01:00:44,089 --> 01:00:45,119
What's your name?

1587
01:00:45,460 --> 01:00:46,860
My name is Kim.

1588
01:00:46,860 --> 01:00:48,060
- "Kim."
- Kim.

1589
01:00:48,060 --> 01:00:49,230
- Okay.
- "Kim."

1590
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:50,659
- Have a seat.
- "Have a seat."

1591
01:00:50,659 --> 01:00:52,259
- Hello.
- Hello.

1592
01:00:52,259 --> 01:00:53,730
Can the guest bring someone...

1593
01:00:53,730 --> 01:00:56,230
without a heads-up, like Dex,
to a wedding in India?

1594
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:59,869
A wedding in India lasts long
for 3 to 5 days.

1595
01:00:59,869 --> 01:01:02,540
It's better for many guests to come
and congratulate the couple.

1596
01:01:02,540 --> 01:01:04,540
That must be why they invited him.

1597
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:07,239
Having many guests must be better,
like in Korea.

1598
01:01:07,239 --> 01:01:09,549
- It's a happy day.
- The more, the better.

1599
01:01:09,679 --> 01:01:13,250
(They entered an Indian wedding
by accident.)

1600
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,549
We should prepare
the congratulatory money.

1601
01:01:15,549 --> 01:01:17,049
Where do we put it?

1602
01:01:18,350 --> 01:01:20,259
Where is...

1603
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:23,690
- the congratulations money?
- "Congratulations money."

1604
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:25,699
Outside of the party.

1605
01:01:25,699 --> 01:01:27,560
- "Outside?"
- Outside.

1606
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:29,270
- Okay, sorry.
- Please take your seat.

1607
01:01:29,270 --> 01:01:30,670
Okay, I will go.

1608
01:01:30,869 --> 01:01:33,869
- No.
- No, we have money.

1609
01:01:34,040 --> 01:01:35,270
We have money.

1610
01:01:35,270 --> 01:01:37,040
- Congratulations money.
- Outside.

1611
01:01:39,080 --> 01:01:40,239
(They gave congratulatory money.)

1612
01:01:40,239 --> 01:01:42,380
Okay. Sorry.

1613
01:01:43,580 --> 01:01:45,250
It's different from Korea.

1614
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,279
Everything is so interesting.

1615
01:01:48,850 --> 01:01:51,619
- It's like I'm watching a movie.
- They have a DJ with a dance party.

1616
01:01:51,619 --> 01:01:53,259
- That amazed me.
- They're full of excitement.

1617
01:01:53,259 --> 01:01:54,790
- It looks fun.
- That was interesting.

1618
01:01:55,659 --> 01:01:58,529
(The Indian wedding
is full of excitement.)

1619
01:02:00,259 --> 01:02:01,460
- Lohit!
- Yes?

1620
01:02:01,460 --> 01:02:02,699
Where is your sister?

1621
01:02:03,929 --> 01:02:07,199
She's finishing her wedding dress.

1622
01:02:07,199 --> 01:02:10,210
After the show,
I will take you to meet her.

1623
01:02:10,210 --> 01:02:11,940
- Okay.
- You will meet my sister.

1624
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:13,980
- Not yet?
- Not yet.

1625
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:16,480
- Right. Let's greet her later.
- Let's take pictures.

1626
01:02:16,810 --> 01:02:20,080
In Korea, if the wedding is at 1 p.m.,

1627
01:02:20,080 --> 01:02:22,549
the ceremony starts
at 1:30 p.m. at the latest.

1628
01:02:22,549 --> 01:02:25,589
We saw the bride taking photos,
putting on makeup,

1629
01:02:25,589 --> 01:02:28,219
and walking around upstairs.

1630
01:02:28,219 --> 01:02:30,690
But the groom was nowhere to be seen.

1631
01:02:31,330 --> 01:02:32,330
(As the bride starts getting ready)

1632
01:02:32,330 --> 01:02:33,730
Gosh, how colorful.

1633
01:02:34,659 --> 01:02:35,900
Where's the groom?

1634
01:02:36,900 --> 01:02:39,440
(The groom gets to the wedding
by elephant or horse.)

1635
01:02:39,739 --> 01:02:41,600
(Slow)

1636
01:02:42,739 --> 01:02:45,170
Remember the wedding gift culture
from the groom to the bride in Korea?

1637
01:02:45,509 --> 01:02:48,679
It's like doing that on his way
to the wedding venue.

1638
01:02:49,409 --> 01:02:52,219
(The wedding venue is missing the groom.)

1639
01:02:54,779 --> 01:02:56,549
When we came to the wedding venue...

1640
01:02:56,549 --> 01:02:58,389
(Bap, bameudora!)

1641
01:02:58,589 --> 01:03:00,460
(What was that?)

1642
01:03:01,089 --> 01:03:02,589
- What?
- My gosh.

1643
01:03:02,589 --> 01:03:04,330
- It was a remix.
- It's a nice beat, right?

1644
01:03:04,330 --> 01:03:05,730
They're greeting you to have food.

1645
01:03:05,730 --> 01:03:07,560
- Food, have food!
- Have food!

1646
01:03:08,230 --> 01:03:10,069
(Food, have food!)

1647
01:03:10,069 --> 01:03:12,299
It would've been awkward
if you hadn't come with me.

1648
01:03:12,299 --> 01:03:14,440
- My cheeks hurt.
- That was nice.

1649
01:03:14,440 --> 01:03:16,110
- It was hilarious.
- Nice.

1650
01:03:16,110 --> 01:03:18,009
- It gets me excited.
- Gosh, you...

1651
01:03:18,610 --> 01:03:21,380
- They're playing club songs at a wedding.
- Yes.

1652
01:03:21,739 --> 01:03:23,580
Are you enjoying the party?

1653
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:24,650
I'm enjoying it.

1654
01:03:24,650 --> 01:03:26,080
- Yes, I'm enjoying it.
- It's so good.

1655
01:03:26,480 --> 01:03:28,380
How long does this party last?

1656
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:30,089
What time does it close?

1657
01:03:30,089 --> 01:03:31,750
- At 6 a.m.
- At 6 a.m. In the morning.

1658
01:03:31,750 --> 01:03:32,889
At 6 a.m?

1659
01:03:32,889 --> 01:03:34,020
- In the morning?
- Yes.

1660
01:03:34,489 --> 01:03:35,730
(All night until the sun rises?)

1661
01:03:35,730 --> 01:03:37,159
- Until 6 a.m.
- All night.

1662
01:03:37,529 --> 01:03:39,230
Until the morning, what...

1663
01:03:39,500 --> 01:03:42,000
Do you dance all the time?

1664
01:03:42,000 --> 01:03:43,029
Yes.

1665
01:03:43,130 --> 01:03:44,830
Dance and food?

1666
01:03:44,830 --> 01:03:46,639
- Yes.
- Good.

1667
01:03:46,639 --> 01:03:47,670
Singing.

1668
01:03:47,670 --> 01:03:48,940
- Yes.
- You sing.

1669
01:03:48,940 --> 01:03:50,139
(They eat and dance for 10 hours
even though it's the 3rd day.)

1670
01:03:50,940 --> 01:03:53,810
I came to the wedding
of someone I've never met in my life.

1671
01:03:53,810 --> 01:03:55,009
We met twice.

1672
01:03:55,009 --> 01:03:57,009
It's really awkward
as I've never met them.

1673
01:03:57,009 --> 01:03:58,210
Yes, it's a little awkward.

1674
01:03:58,210 --> 01:04:01,020
It's a little awkward.

1675
01:04:01,279 --> 01:04:03,690
(And they maintained silence.)

1676
01:04:03,690 --> 01:04:04,750
Gosh.

1677
01:04:05,319 --> 01:04:06,420
It's awkward.

1678
01:04:06,819 --> 01:04:08,020
Gosh, this is...

1679
01:04:11,190 --> 01:04:12,960
- What is everyone doing?
- Hey.

1680
01:04:12,960 --> 01:04:14,360
- Yes?
- She's my sister.

1681
01:04:14,360 --> 01:04:16,029
- Your sister?
- Sister?

1682
01:04:17,600 --> 01:04:18,699
It's similar to what we do.

1683
01:04:18,699 --> 01:04:20,299
- Playing a video like this.
- They play a video like this.

1684
01:04:21,369 --> 01:04:25,239
The wedding video is like a music video.

1685
01:04:27,279 --> 01:04:28,540
It's like a Bollywood movie.

1686
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:31,179
- Right.
- You're right.

1687
01:04:31,179 --> 01:04:32,219
Yes.

1688
01:04:32,449 --> 01:04:34,250
It looks cool.

1689
01:04:35,449 --> 01:04:36,790
Eat.

1690
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:37,949
Yes. Thank you.

1691
01:04:37,949 --> 01:04:39,089
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1692
01:04:42,429 --> 01:04:43,630
(Savoring)

1693
01:04:46,659 --> 01:04:47,960
Is it nice?

1694
01:04:48,159 --> 01:04:49,830
- Very delicious.
- Delicious.

1695
01:04:50,369 --> 01:04:52,000
A vegetable bowl?

1696
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:53,000
Yes.

1697
01:04:54,199 --> 01:04:56,110
- It's a buffet.
- That's nice.

1698
01:04:56,110 --> 01:04:58,009
- It's like a standing party.
- It looks delicious.

1699
01:04:58,009 --> 01:04:59,110
It's a curry buffet.

1700
01:04:59,480 --> 01:05:00,710
It's amazing.

1701
01:05:01,710 --> 01:05:04,880
(Even the picky eater
who has a taste palate of a child...)

1702
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,420
(is satisfied.)

1703
01:05:07,750 --> 01:05:10,219
(As they eat...)

1704
01:05:11,250 --> 01:05:13,560
They do this until the morning?

1705
01:05:15,589 --> 01:05:16,889
(About 40 minutes have passed
and it's currently 8:40 p.m.)

1706
01:05:16,889 --> 01:05:18,690
They've been there for 40 minutes.

1707
01:05:18,900 --> 01:05:21,259
The groom isn't coming.

1708
01:05:22,369 --> 01:05:24,029
The groom was really late.

1709
01:05:24,270 --> 01:05:25,639
I was like, "Is it okay?"

1710
01:05:26,239 --> 01:05:28,699
I'll go and look around. You stay here.

1711
01:05:28,699 --> 01:05:30,710
- Let's go together.
- What?

1712
01:05:31,440 --> 01:05:32,839
- Let's go.
- Take a rest.

1713
01:05:32,839 --> 01:05:34,409
(They decided to look around the venue.)

1714
01:05:34,409 --> 01:05:35,880
- Okay.
- Hello.

1715
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,250
(Saying "hello" with confidence)

1716
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:40,049
Hello.

1717
01:05:40,049 --> 01:05:42,750
(Two brothers are looking around
as if they're their relatives.)

1718
01:05:44,219 --> 01:05:46,619
I guess this family believes
in the elephant deity.

1719
01:05:46,960 --> 01:05:48,020
Do they?

1720
01:05:48,319 --> 01:05:49,560
Maybe that's why they have
this statue here.

1721
01:05:49,560 --> 01:05:50,690
- It's Ganesha.
- Ganesha.

1722
01:05:50,690 --> 01:05:52,330
- He's a famous deity.
- Ganesha.

1723
01:05:52,500 --> 01:05:54,799
The bride and the groom
will probably enter here...

1724
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:56,270
and go up like this.

1725
01:05:56,469 --> 01:05:58,770
- I guess so.
- They would sit there.

1726
01:05:59,469 --> 01:06:00,670
I guess so.

1727
01:06:00,670 --> 01:06:02,210
I guess it's like a bridal suite...

1728
01:06:02,210 --> 01:06:04,239
where people bless
the bride and the groom...

1729
01:06:04,239 --> 01:06:06,540
and take pictures.

1730
01:06:06,739 --> 01:06:08,509
There's no seat for the officiant.

1731
01:06:08,509 --> 01:06:09,549
I know.

1732
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:12,080
And a friend who sings for them.

1733
01:06:12,719 --> 01:06:14,549
(There is always someone who sings
at a wedding in Korea.)

1734
01:06:14,949 --> 01:06:16,690
- That was eight years ago.
- Oh, my.

1735
01:06:16,690 --> 01:06:18,319
It's been such a long time
since I watched this.

1736
01:06:19,319 --> 01:06:22,020
(To meet you)

1737
01:06:22,020 --> 01:06:24,589
(I'll stop here!)

1738
01:06:25,389 --> 01:06:28,330
- Were you at a karaoke? What was it?
- It was a rehearsal.

1739
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:30,029
- Was it a rehearsal?
- It was a rehearsal.

1740
01:06:30,199 --> 01:06:31,299
Someone must sing.

1741
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:34,670
- They have a proper stage here.
- Yes.

1742
01:06:34,670 --> 01:06:36,839
Did you see the stage prepared?

1743
01:06:36,839 --> 01:06:38,110
- The white one.
- Yes.

1744
01:06:38,110 --> 01:06:40,009
No one went there yet as they were shy.

1745
01:06:40,009 --> 01:06:43,049
The one who starts dancing over there...

1746
01:06:43,049 --> 01:06:45,409
will set the mood
for the wedding that day.

1747
01:06:45,409 --> 01:06:47,279
- They will lead others.
- Yes.

1748
01:06:47,750 --> 01:06:50,449
I guess some people might want...

1749
01:06:50,449 --> 01:06:52,020
- to draw attention.
- Yes.

1750
01:06:54,860 --> 01:06:56,730
I think he was itching to do it.

1751
01:06:59,529 --> 01:07:02,270
(Who is he?)

1752
01:07:02,270 --> 01:07:03,400
- What?
- What is it?

1753
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:05,299
(Kian84 is gone.)

1754
01:07:05,299 --> 01:07:06,600
Where did he go?

1755
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:08,739
Did he go to start dancing?

1756
01:07:08,739 --> 01:07:10,569
(Laughing)

1757
01:07:11,009 --> 01:07:12,040
Thank you.

1758
01:07:12,040 --> 01:07:13,540
(Where did Kian84 go?)

1759
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:16,650
(Kian84 is wandering around.)

1760
01:07:16,650 --> 01:07:17,750
Hello.

1761
01:07:18,779 --> 01:07:19,850
Hello.

1762
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,560
Are you getting married here?

1763
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:27,619
No.

1764
01:07:28,119 --> 01:07:30,029
- What is it?
- What's going on?

1765
01:07:32,330 --> 01:07:34,060
Is your sister getting married?

1766
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,330
- Yes.
- Your sister is getting married.

1767
01:07:36,330 --> 01:07:37,369
Congratulations.

1768
01:07:37,369 --> 01:07:39,170
- That was nice, Hee Min.
- Yes.

1769
01:07:39,639 --> 01:07:41,670
- She's her sister.
- Do you like it here?

1770
01:07:41,900 --> 01:07:43,469
- Sorry?
- Do you like everything?

1771
01:07:44,009 --> 01:07:45,569
- The building?
- Everything.

1772
01:07:45,569 --> 01:07:46,710
- "The building."
- Everything?

1773
01:07:46,710 --> 01:07:47,810
- Yes.
- Yes.

1774
01:07:47,810 --> 01:07:53,179
- I like it.
- Okay.

1775
01:07:53,480 --> 01:07:56,089
Is this a tattoo?

1776
01:07:56,389 --> 01:07:57,489
- What?
- Tattoo?

1777
01:07:57,489 --> 01:07:58,920
No, this is called mehndi.

1778
01:07:58,920 --> 01:07:59,989
- "Mehndi?"
- "Mehndi?"

1779
01:07:59,989 --> 01:08:01,690
- It's henna.
- Henna.

1780
01:08:01,690 --> 01:08:03,290
- I know it.
- Yes.

1781
01:08:03,290 --> 01:08:05,659
I got one at Gyeongpo Pavillion in Korea.

1782
01:08:05,659 --> 01:08:07,029
- Yes.
- It's called henna.

1783
01:08:07,029 --> 01:08:08,500
Henna. I know it.

1784
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,029
In India, we call it mehndi.

1785
01:08:10,029 --> 01:08:11,100
"Mehndi?"

1786
01:08:11,100 --> 01:08:12,400
(They draw mehndi on their hands and feet
to bless the wedding.)

1787
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:13,770
- That's mehndi.
- It's beautiful.

1788
01:08:14,040 --> 01:08:16,310
Yes. Like this.

1789
01:08:17,239 --> 01:08:18,869
- Beautiful. Yes.
- Yes.

1790
01:08:18,869 --> 01:08:21,279
(Beautiful)

1791
01:08:21,509 --> 01:08:23,409
- She's beautiful.
- She's beautiful.

1792
01:08:24,049 --> 01:08:25,110
Thank you.

1793
01:08:25,650 --> 01:08:27,250
(Smiling)

1794
01:08:27,779 --> 01:08:29,020
Come. Let's go.

1795
01:08:31,020 --> 01:08:32,460
- Over there?
- Come.

1796
01:08:32,719 --> 01:08:33,989
- Now, dance?
- Yes.

1797
01:08:33,989 --> 01:08:35,159
- Okay.
- They're going together.

1798
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,560
All right. Let's dance.

1799
01:08:36,560 --> 01:08:37,630
- Oh, my.
- Gosh.

1800
01:08:38,060 --> 01:08:39,500
(Just a moment.)

1801
01:08:40,330 --> 01:08:41,759
She's leading him.

1802
01:08:42,400 --> 01:08:43,400
They're going to dance.

1803
01:08:43,400 --> 01:08:44,699
(Modest)

1804
01:08:44,969 --> 01:08:46,040
(She picked a song.)

1805
01:08:46,040 --> 01:08:47,069
Dance.

1806
01:08:47,369 --> 01:08:48,540
Yes. Just do it.

1807
01:08:49,540 --> 01:08:50,770
Wait.

1808
01:08:51,339 --> 01:08:52,610
(Saxophone sound)

1809
01:08:52,610 --> 01:08:53,880
You dance?

1810
01:08:53,880 --> 01:08:55,639
(What's with the song choice?)

1811
01:08:55,639 --> 01:08:57,310
- What?
- Blues?

1812
01:08:57,310 --> 01:08:58,580
Is it blues time?

1813
01:08:59,250 --> 01:09:00,420
You dance?

1814
01:09:00,420 --> 01:09:01,679
(Laughing)

1815
01:09:06,560 --> 01:09:07,659
Gosh.

1816
01:09:07,659 --> 01:09:08,790
Oh, my.

1817
01:09:08,790 --> 01:09:09,889
- Okay.
- It's an upbeat song.

1818
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,630
(Grooving)

1819
01:09:13,159 --> 01:09:14,860
He's starting the engine.

1820
01:09:16,330 --> 01:09:18,069
- Swag.
- "Swag."

1821
01:09:18,529 --> 01:09:19,600
Okay.

1822
01:09:19,940 --> 01:09:21,369
He yelled out, "Swag."

1823
01:09:22,369 --> 01:09:23,409
(All eyes are on him as they heard him.)

1824
01:09:23,409 --> 01:09:24,670
- Show them.
- Swag.

1825
01:09:24,909 --> 01:09:27,080
(Who is dancing?)

1826
01:09:27,310 --> 01:09:29,610
- They're coming.
- They're gathering.

1827
01:09:32,009 --> 01:09:33,020
(Excited)

1828
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:35,449
He's really excited.

1829
01:09:36,089 --> 01:09:38,049
This is driving me crazy.

1830
01:09:38,290 --> 01:09:40,619
(At that moment,
his friend was waiting for him.)

1831
01:09:40,619 --> 01:09:42,790
He told me.

1832
01:09:42,989 --> 01:09:44,790
"Your friend is over there."

1833
01:09:45,900 --> 01:09:47,159
What are they doing?

1834
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,999
You were wondering what was happening.

1835
01:09:49,929 --> 01:09:51,629
(What?)

1836
01:09:53,700 --> 01:09:55,740
(He saw his friend moving his hips.)

1837
01:09:55,740 --> 01:09:58,009
(Immersed)

1838
01:10:00,209 --> 01:10:02,549
I was shocked. It was shocking.

1839
01:10:03,350 --> 01:10:05,049
This is driving me crazy.

1840
01:10:05,049 --> 01:10:06,280
It's hilarious.

1841
01:10:07,079 --> 01:10:08,879
Dance time.

1842
01:10:08,879 --> 01:10:09,990
(This is what dance is!)

1843
01:10:10,789 --> 01:10:14,919
(The one who starts and sets the mood?)

1844
01:10:15,389 --> 01:10:16,530
(I set the mood.)

1845
01:10:16,530 --> 01:10:18,629
- I didn't know he would be the one.
- I know. Kian84 did it.

1846
01:10:19,259 --> 01:10:20,660
(He took over the stage with fancy steps.)

1847
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,299
Look at his steps. They're intricate.

1848
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:24,829
(I should record this.)

1849
01:10:24,829 --> 01:10:26,870
(Shocked)

1850
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:29,139
- Swag.
- Once you start dancing,

1851
01:10:29,139 --> 01:10:30,839
you get excited.

1852
01:10:30,839 --> 01:10:32,139
What's wrong with him?

1853
01:10:33,410 --> 01:10:35,079
Why did he get excited out of nowhere?

1854
01:10:35,709 --> 01:10:37,079
(I don't know.)

1855
01:10:37,450 --> 01:10:39,879
- "I don't know."
- "I don't know."

1856
01:10:39,980 --> 01:10:41,450
(Swinging)

1857
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:42,719
(Tossing)

1858
01:10:43,020 --> 01:10:44,990
(She dances with him.)

1859
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:48,089
(Flailing)

1860
01:10:48,759 --> 01:10:49,959
- He's going to make it.
- My gosh.

1861
01:10:50,660 --> 01:10:51,860
Oh, my goodness.

1862
01:10:52,860 --> 01:10:54,230
(Before Kian84 danced)

1863
01:10:54,230 --> 01:10:55,799
(After Kian84 danced)

1864
01:10:55,799 --> 01:10:58,299
- Seriously, so many people gathered.
- Swag.

1865
01:10:59,499 --> 01:11:01,740
He was shaking up India.

1866
01:11:02,639 --> 01:11:03,639
(Yes!)

1867
01:11:04,870 --> 01:11:06,379
(Yes!)

1868
01:11:06,610 --> 01:11:08,240
(Yes!)

1869
01:11:08,839 --> 01:11:10,410
She must've been so surprised.

1870
01:11:11,910 --> 01:11:13,450
(Sorry)

1871
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,620
(He wraps it up in a hurry.)

1872
01:11:17,620 --> 01:11:18,690
This is embarrassing.

1873
01:11:19,289 --> 01:11:20,889
(He pretends not to know.)

1874
01:11:21,589 --> 01:11:22,660
(The hiding skill
of a former special forces agent)

1875
01:11:22,660 --> 01:11:23,990
Why were you doing that?

1876
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:25,929
This is embarrassing.

1877
01:11:26,660 --> 01:11:29,060
(He tries to hide belatedly.)

1878
01:11:29,060 --> 01:11:30,100
I'm embarrassed.

1879
01:11:31,129 --> 01:11:32,169
- I'm embarrassed.
- Are you okay?

1880
01:11:32,169 --> 01:11:33,370
- I'm okay.
- What is it?

1881
01:11:33,370 --> 01:11:36,310
I'm fine. I'm very shy.

1882
01:11:36,310 --> 01:11:37,810
- Are you okay?
- After he danced like that?

1883
01:11:37,810 --> 01:11:39,740
- I'm very shy.
- He did everything.

1884
01:11:39,740 --> 01:11:41,280
- The reality hit him.
- He regrets it.

1885
01:11:41,639 --> 01:11:43,450
Are you shy? You were very good.

1886
01:11:43,450 --> 01:11:45,049
- Thank you.
- You're a beautiful dancer.

1887
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:47,879
(They're coming.)

1888
01:11:48,480 --> 01:11:50,289
Why was he doing that?

1889
01:11:50,620 --> 01:11:52,350
What was that?

1890
01:11:52,350 --> 01:11:54,690
- He doesn't know him.
- I thought he might drag me.

1891
01:11:54,690 --> 01:11:56,560
- What was wrong with you?
- He was embarrassed.

1892
01:11:56,560 --> 01:11:58,060
This is my table.

1893
01:11:58,060 --> 01:11:59,259
- Okay.
- Okay.

1894
01:11:59,259 --> 01:12:00,959
Do you want to go to my table?

1895
01:12:00,959 --> 01:12:01,999
- Let's go.
- Yes.

1896
01:12:03,200 --> 01:12:06,499
(Laughing)

1897
01:12:07,070 --> 01:12:08,100
Come here.

1898
01:12:10,910 --> 01:12:12,610
- Yes.
- Thank you.

1899
01:12:12,980 --> 01:12:14,780
It was Dex's seat.

1900
01:12:14,780 --> 01:12:16,280
(While he was hiding,
someone took his seat.)

1901
01:12:16,980 --> 01:12:18,679
Dex wasn't important at that moment.

1902
01:12:18,679 --> 01:12:19,749
(He forgot about his friend for a moment.)

1903
01:12:20,350 --> 01:12:22,150
I look terrible.

1904
01:12:23,289 --> 01:12:24,289
(He's fixing his hair.)

1905
01:12:24,289 --> 01:12:27,020
I should have at least got my hair done.

1906
01:12:27,759 --> 01:12:28,889
What's your name?

1907
01:12:28,889 --> 01:12:30,829
- Naina.
- Naina?

1908
01:12:31,089 --> 01:12:32,929
- Naina.
- Naina?

1909
01:12:32,929 --> 01:12:34,929
- Naina.
- Naina.

1910
01:12:34,929 --> 01:12:36,230
- Naina.
- Naina.

1911
01:12:36,230 --> 01:12:37,870
- Naina.
- Yes.

1912
01:12:37,870 --> 01:12:39,240
Your name? Naina.

1913
01:12:39,539 --> 01:12:40,799
- Naina.
- Yes.

1914
01:12:40,799 --> 01:12:42,440
(Gosh, Kian84)

1915
01:12:43,139 --> 01:12:44,940
You know the meaning of "Naina?"

1916
01:12:45,240 --> 01:12:46,810
- I know.
- What?

1917
01:12:47,110 --> 01:12:48,179
Your name.

1918
01:12:49,450 --> 01:12:52,179
In India, when we tell someone our names,

1919
01:12:52,179 --> 01:12:54,749
we tell them the meanings.

1920
01:12:55,120 --> 01:12:56,419
It means "eye."

1921
01:12:56,589 --> 01:12:58,690
- Eye?
- Yes. It means "eye."

1922
01:12:58,690 --> 01:12:59,889
- Eye.
- Eye.

1923
01:12:59,889 --> 01:13:02,360
- Your name means "eye."
- Yes. Eye.

1924
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:04,060
- Gosh.
- Yes.

1925
01:13:04,259 --> 01:13:06,360
- Your eyes are good.
- Yes.

1926
01:13:06,360 --> 01:13:08,129
- Beautiful.
- Yes.

1927
01:13:08,530 --> 01:13:11,129
He was talking to her
very enthusiastically.

1928
01:13:11,700 --> 01:13:14,240
I'm very happy to dance with you.

1929
01:13:14,240 --> 01:13:16,039
This is the most fluent
I've seen you speak English...

1930
01:13:16,039 --> 01:13:17,240
Yes, I keep getting better.

1931
01:13:17,240 --> 01:13:20,679
All my life... I won't be able to forget.

1932
01:13:21,410 --> 01:13:22,509
"I won't be able to forget."

1933
01:13:22,509 --> 01:13:25,679
Remember... Remember India...

1934
01:13:26,179 --> 01:13:28,450
Remember dancing with you.

1935
01:13:28,549 --> 01:13:30,190
- He told her how he truly feels.
- Yes. Thank you.

1936
01:13:30,490 --> 01:13:33,120
- Very beautiful.
- I also liked dancing with you.

1937
01:13:33,190 --> 01:13:35,320
- Yes. I loved it.
- I loved it.

1938
01:13:36,030 --> 01:13:39,259
Next time, dance. Next time.

1939
01:13:39,259 --> 01:13:41,200
(Gloomy)

1940
01:13:41,360 --> 01:13:42,530
Are you married?

1941
01:13:42,730 --> 01:13:44,999
Yes, I'm married.

1942
01:13:44,999 --> 01:13:46,070
You're married?

1943
01:13:46,070 --> 01:13:48,070
- What?
- Gosh.

1944
01:13:48,070 --> 01:13:50,910
- Wait.
- What?

1945
01:13:50,910 --> 01:13:53,240
It's not that she was interested in him.

1946
01:13:53,240 --> 01:13:55,879
- Right, she was just dancing.
- She just likes to have fun.

1947
01:13:56,549 --> 01:13:58,310
What if I get a scolding?

1948
01:13:58,810 --> 01:14:00,950
Won't your husband be angry at me?

1949
01:14:00,950 --> 01:14:03,089
No.

1950
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:05,289
You're a very kind person.

1951
01:14:05,289 --> 01:14:06,820
- Is he a very cool guy?
- Yes.

1952
01:14:06,820 --> 01:14:08,020
I see. Thank you.

1953
01:14:09,020 --> 01:14:10,259
I'm...

1954
01:14:10,259 --> 01:14:11,690
- single.
- Single.

1955
01:14:11,690 --> 01:14:12,929
- Single.
- I see.

1956
01:14:13,160 --> 01:14:15,629
My brother is...

1957
01:14:15,629 --> 01:14:17,700
- in the fire pit of singlehood.
- "The fire pit of singlehood."

1958
01:14:18,129 --> 01:14:19,299
I'm single.

1959
01:14:19,770 --> 01:14:21,469
(The younger friend,
who is in the fire pit of singlehood,)

1960
01:14:21,469 --> 01:14:23,969
(and the older friend, who is just single)

1961
01:14:27,839 --> 01:14:30,879
(Is this sweat flowing from my eyes?)

1962
01:14:31,009 --> 01:14:35,120
Her husband came to say hi later on.

1963
01:14:35,120 --> 01:14:38,950
He told me to take it easy and have fun,
so I felt at ease.

1964
01:14:39,320 --> 01:14:41,959
- Since it's a party, anyway.
- Right.

1965
01:14:42,759 --> 01:14:45,289
(Naina leaves after having fun.)

1966
01:14:45,389 --> 01:14:46,900
(He turns around.)

1967
01:14:47,600 --> 01:14:49,100
- Dex. Come over here.
- Yes?

1968
01:14:50,400 --> 01:14:51,570
- Now, he's looking for him.
- Right.

1969
01:14:52,570 --> 01:14:54,770
- Is your blind date over?
- What?

1970
01:14:54,770 --> 01:14:56,469
No, she's married.

1971
01:14:57,870 --> 01:14:59,839
Why did you start dancing all of a sudden?

1972
01:15:00,009 --> 01:15:01,639
She asked me to dance with her.

1973
01:15:01,639 --> 01:15:03,610
- "Shall we dance?"
- Yes.

1974
01:15:04,379 --> 01:15:08,179
It felt like "Scent of a Woman."

1975
01:15:08,179 --> 01:15:09,179
("Scent of a Woman" is a movie
that came out 30 years ago.)

1976
01:15:09,549 --> 01:15:11,690
- You had a good time.
- Yes.

1977
01:15:12,049 --> 01:15:14,060
(I was happy.)

1978
01:15:14,520 --> 01:15:16,459
It's past 10:00 p.m. now.

1979
01:15:16,459 --> 01:15:17,530
(Current time: 10:05 p.m.)

1980
01:15:18,560 --> 01:15:20,660
It feels as if
we're waiting for a celebrity.

1981
01:15:21,230 --> 01:15:23,730
We really couldn't tell
when he would get there.

1982
01:15:23,870 --> 01:15:25,370
The ceremony itself...

1983
01:15:25,370 --> 01:15:27,100
- continues until 6:00 a.m.
- That's right.

1984
01:15:27,100 --> 01:15:29,740
There's not much of a difference whether
he arrives at 10:00 p.m. or 11:00 p.m.

1985
01:15:29,740 --> 01:15:31,910
So the bride will keep dancing
until 3:00 a.m.

1986
01:15:31,910 --> 01:15:33,839
As long as he gets here.

1987
01:15:34,780 --> 01:15:37,610
They're all moving around
as if this is the torch relay.

1988
01:15:37,610 --> 01:15:39,280
- As long as he's there before morning.
- Yes.

1989
01:15:40,650 --> 01:15:42,650
Even the elders are dancing.

1990
01:15:44,219 --> 01:15:45,820
(Ever since Kian84's opening performance,
the dance floor was opened.)

1991
01:15:45,820 --> 01:15:48,259
- Gosh.
- You started it off well.

1992
01:15:48,259 --> 01:15:51,190
The stage was opened thanks to Kian84.

1993
01:15:51,190 --> 01:15:52,190
(They're each enjoying the ceremony.)

1994
01:15:53,499 --> 01:15:56,270
The groom isn't here,
but the people are excited.

1995
01:15:56,270 --> 01:15:57,600
(The groom still isn't here.)

1996
01:16:00,370 --> 01:16:01,400
Hello.

1997
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:02,969
Hello.

1998
01:16:04,940 --> 01:16:06,179
(Approaching)

1999
01:16:07,440 --> 01:16:09,810
(The Dancing Man came looking for Kian84.)

2000
01:16:10,179 --> 01:16:12,049
You're the best dancer.

2001
01:16:12,379 --> 01:16:14,280
You dance the best. Yes.

2002
01:16:15,520 --> 01:16:17,120
- Do you want to dance together?
- Dancing?

2003
01:16:17,450 --> 01:16:19,120
They heard about him.

2004
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:21,259
They heard that there's
a Korean dancing machine here.

2005
01:16:21,259 --> 01:16:23,360
Dance? Dance now?

2006
01:16:23,589 --> 01:16:25,889
Go? All right, I'm going to go dance.

2007
01:16:26,400 --> 01:16:27,730
- He's going. He's going again.
- He's going.

2008
01:16:27,730 --> 01:16:29,999
- He won't back down now.
- He's going to show them.

2009
01:16:29,999 --> 01:16:31,200
Let's dance.

2010
01:16:31,200 --> 01:16:32,839
("Let's dance.")

2011
01:16:34,039 --> 01:16:36,509
Kian84 had dreamed about this
before he went there.

2012
01:16:37,910 --> 01:16:41,410
(Dancing with Indians)

2013
01:16:42,780 --> 01:16:45,049
- It's like Bollywood for him right now.
- That's right.

2014
01:16:45,049 --> 01:16:46,450
(He's warming up to fulfill his dream.)

2015
01:16:46,950 --> 01:16:48,679
(Revving)

2016
01:16:48,850 --> 01:16:49,950
(Revving)

2017
01:16:50,150 --> 01:16:51,350
He's dancing like
he's starting the engine.

2018
01:16:51,350 --> 01:16:54,490
(Now, it's time for him
to fulfill his dream.)

2019
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:56,329
Nice.

2020
01:16:57,129 --> 01:16:59,129
(He's just amazed at Kian84.)

2021
01:16:59,660 --> 01:17:01,799
(He's flapping around diligently when...)

2022
01:17:02,129 --> 01:17:04,329
("I want to join.")

2023
01:17:07,600 --> 01:17:08,999
- Isn't that Lohit?
- Yes.

2024
01:17:08,999 --> 01:17:10,410
Lohit's amazing.

2025
01:17:10,509 --> 01:17:12,879
Gosh. They're so enthusiastic.

2026
01:17:13,539 --> 01:17:14,579
Lohit.

2027
01:17:17,579 --> 01:17:20,620
I'm the bomb.

2028
01:17:21,549 --> 01:17:24,549
(The loneliness he felt
at Mother Ganga's river...)

2029
01:17:25,450 --> 01:17:27,759
(has been healed.)

2030
01:17:29,120 --> 01:17:31,490
He's shy during the day
and active during the night.

2031
01:17:31,490 --> 01:17:33,660
- You're insane. What are you...
- He's stronger at night.

2032
01:17:33,660 --> 01:17:35,429
- You're insane.
- What?

2033
01:17:35,429 --> 01:17:37,700
He's healing. This is where he heals.

2034
01:17:37,700 --> 01:17:39,429
(The air is hot.)

2035
01:17:40,070 --> 01:17:42,570
(That foreigner knows how to party.)

2036
01:17:42,940 --> 01:17:44,139
- Go.
- Go.

2037
01:17:44,539 --> 01:17:46,579
Go. Move.

2038
01:17:46,740 --> 01:17:48,179
- Gosh.
- Goodness.

2039
01:17:48,179 --> 01:17:49,440
Move.

2040
01:17:49,980 --> 01:17:51,079
Yes.

2041
01:17:51,610 --> 01:17:53,749
Turn.

2042
01:17:53,919 --> 01:17:55,919
Turn.

2043
01:17:56,020 --> 01:17:58,850
(He's dancing like
he'll be entering Bollywood.)

2044
01:17:59,959 --> 01:18:02,419
(They've taken over the stage.)

2045
01:18:02,820 --> 01:18:04,530
I'm glad you went to India.

2046
01:18:05,759 --> 01:18:07,230
Where's Dex?

2047
01:18:08,759 --> 01:18:10,669
Lohit, come.

2048
01:18:11,429 --> 01:18:13,339
- Hayarubbam.
- Hayarubbam.

2049
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,299
He's taking the lead. Goodness.

2050
01:18:15,499 --> 01:18:17,910
(When Kian84 gets on his knees,)

2051
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:19,009
(they get on their knees with him.)

2052
01:18:19,310 --> 01:18:20,480
This is Bollywood.

2053
01:18:21,410 --> 01:18:23,910
(He has even learned the footstep dance.)

2054
01:18:24,679 --> 01:18:26,749
How many is he dancing with, by himself?

2055
01:18:29,120 --> 01:18:30,320
It looks fun.

2056
01:18:30,320 --> 01:18:33,060
Dancing together like that is elating.

2057
01:18:33,759 --> 01:18:35,789
(Shaking around diligently...)

2058
01:18:35,789 --> 01:18:37,690
There were more and more people.

2059
01:18:38,030 --> 01:18:39,759
(is getting him exhausted.)

2060
01:18:40,160 --> 01:18:41,360
(He spotted an exit.)

2061
01:18:41,829 --> 01:18:44,730
(Well then, goodbye.)

2062
01:18:44,730 --> 01:18:47,100
He's getting out of there.
It looks natural.

2063
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:50,370
I'm exhausted.

2064
01:18:51,870 --> 01:18:53,209
He caught him.

2065
01:18:54,639 --> 01:18:56,450
"Where are you going?"

2066
01:18:56,450 --> 01:18:57,910
"Where do you think you're going?"

2067
01:18:57,950 --> 01:19:00,980
I'm exhausted. I'm tired.

2068
01:19:01,520 --> 01:19:02,780
- Here.
- No.

2069
01:19:02,919 --> 01:19:04,389
(They won't let him talk.)

2070
01:19:04,389 --> 01:19:05,389
- Here.
- No.

2071
01:19:05,589 --> 01:19:07,490
(Welcome to the fire pit of dancing.)

2072
01:19:08,160 --> 01:19:10,190
- Goodness.
- They didn't let me go.

2073
01:19:10,459 --> 01:19:12,259
How long have you been dancing?

2074
01:19:12,259 --> 01:19:13,999
He's been dancing for about 30 minutes.

2075
01:19:16,799 --> 01:19:18,429
Gosh. I'm tired!

2076
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:20,570
Stop!

2077
01:19:21,299 --> 01:19:22,339
Stop!

2078
01:19:23,509 --> 01:19:25,009
Stop!

2079
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:26,810
Stop!

2080
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:29,650
You must have no regrets.

2081
01:19:29,650 --> 01:19:31,179
(Bollywood84 fulfilled
his dancing dreams to the fullest.)

2082
01:19:31,410 --> 01:19:33,950
So did the groom show up or not?

2083
01:19:33,950 --> 01:19:35,120
I don't think he's here right now.

2084
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:36,520
That day...

2085
01:19:39,450 --> 01:19:41,089
(The groom...)

2086
01:19:41,089 --> 01:19:42,990
He's coming.

2087
01:19:43,490 --> 01:19:44,990
- Gosh.
- Finally.

2088
01:19:44,990 --> 01:19:47,200
(Do we finally get to see the groom?)

2089
01:19:48,030 --> 01:19:52,270
(The unending wedding party
is coming soon.)

2090
01:19:53,669 --> 01:19:55,900
(The day after Kian84's wild night
of dancing at the party)

2091
01:19:56,740 --> 01:19:57,969
(Dex)

2092
01:19:58,410 --> 01:19:59,980
(I feel like my body's broken.)

2093
01:20:00,709 --> 01:20:03,549
(With the wedding that Kian84 enjoyed
more than the groom behind them,)

2094
01:20:04,379 --> 01:20:05,709
(the two begin...)

2095
01:20:05,709 --> 01:20:06,749
(their India trip full of energy.)

2096
01:20:06,820 --> 01:20:08,219
(Namaste)

2097
01:20:08,650 --> 01:20:09,820
(They get a sacred start to their day
by being blessed in the morning.)

2098
01:20:09,820 --> 01:20:11,049
(A blessing touch)

2099
01:20:11,219 --> 01:20:13,560
(Give me 1,000 rupees.)

2100
01:20:13,990 --> 01:20:15,759
(To the sadhus who are after
enthusiastic consumers...)

2101
01:20:16,389 --> 01:20:18,560
(No! Enough!)

2102
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:19,629
(Dex is standing firm.)

2103
01:20:19,759 --> 01:20:21,499
(Kian84 is scared.)

2104
01:20:22,060 --> 01:20:23,530
(With the protection
of his reliable friend,)

2105
01:20:23,870 --> 01:20:25,429
(he goes to take the train,
which is on his bucket list.)

2106
01:20:25,730 --> 01:20:26,839
(It's over there.)

2107
01:20:26,839 --> 01:20:27,940
(It's here.)

2108
01:20:28,100 --> 01:20:29,810
(Dex, who is in shrewd traveler mode,)

2109
01:20:30,509 --> 01:20:31,740
(I'm going to sleep.)

2110
01:20:32,070 --> 01:20:34,240
(and India84,
who is in local mode without fail.)

2111
01:20:34,509 --> 01:20:36,879
(Same space, different temperature)

2112
01:20:37,549 --> 01:20:38,950
(They enter the long-awaited train,
which was on Kian84's bucket list.)

2113
01:20:38,950 --> 01:20:40,650
(Why is our seat...)

2114
01:20:40,950 --> 01:20:42,620
(Kian84's seat)

2115
01:20:43,049 --> 01:20:45,249
(It's disconcerting from the start.)

2116
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,959
(Their dynamic train journey
is coming soon.)
