(Chuu)

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,100
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

6
00:00:40,667 --> 00:00:42,033
We're here

7
00:00:45,533 --> 00:00:46,633
You go in

8
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,200
Yun Jae that...

9
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,567
Oh, I have something for you.

10
00:00:52,567 --> 00:00:54,233
Wait a minute

11
00:00:54,233 --> 00:00:55,633
for you

12
00:00:57,433 --> 00:01:00,300
I heard this is a very popular soft candy recently

13
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,067
Don't eat too much or you'll get cavities.

14
00:01:02,067 --> 00:01:04,667
Always brush your teeth after eating

15
00:01:04,667 --> 00:01:06,767
Why did you suddenly give me candy?

16
00:01:08,333 --> 00:01:13,700
Some people say that eating gummy candies will give you courage.

17
00:01:13,700 --> 00:01:19,200
Nothing requires more courage than liking someone.

18
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:21,367
You have me now

19
00:01:21,367 --> 00:01:23,133
I don't need any fudge, right?

20
00:01:24,567 --> 00:01:25,700
gentlemen

21
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,367
You know...

22
00:01:27,367 --> 00:01:30,100
Like someone

23
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,300
Does it also require courage?

24
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:35,100
I ate so many gummies when I was dating you

25
00:01:42,267 --> 00:01:44,067
Just stay by my side like you are now

26
00:01:44,967 --> 00:01:47,033
That's enough for me.

27
00:01:48,233 --> 00:01:51,900
"Open your eyes"

28
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,567
"The dream moment"

29
00:01:55,567 --> 00:01:58,333
"Please remember it's for you"

30
00:01:58,333 --> 00:02:02,967
"I'm always with you"

31
00:02:02,967 --> 00:02:06,633
"I see your eyes"

32
00:02:06,633 --> 00:02:10,400
"Full of tears"

33
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,333
"I will never shed tears again"

34
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:15,733
"So believe me now"

35
00:02:15,733 --> 00:02:17,567
Really delicious

36
00:02:18,433 --> 00:02:20,533
Gained courage

37
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:38,300
"I'm painting you just like yesterday."

38
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,233
Good night, Kim Ji-eun

39
00:02:41,233 --> 00:02:44,533
"You want to know that I still see you"

40
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:48,233
"Cuz you are the only one"

(Episode 4: Excessive Confession)

42
00:02:52,067 --> 00:02:53,833
Are you crazy?

43
00:02:53,833 --> 00:02:54,500
What did you just say?

44
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,633
This is actually better

45
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:59,167
Anyway, you were planning to tell your parents this weekend.

46
00:02:59,167 --> 00:03:03,000
Strike while the iron is hot. Take this opportunity to speak honestly.

47
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,033
Even so, how can I go home like this?

48
00:03:05,033 --> 00:03:07,233
Even pretending to be your boyfriend

49
00:03:07,233 --> 00:03:11,500
So who told you to tell such a lie?

50
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,833
Hello

51
00:03:12,833 --> 00:03:15,000
Ever since you told that lie

52
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,500
Look

53
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:19,167
Mom texts and calls every day

54
00:03:19,167 --> 00:03:21,333
It makes it impossible for me to work.

55
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:24,867
It's not enough for a daughter to become a son

56
00:03:24,867 --> 00:03:25,667
Even become a son-in-law?

57
00:03:25,667 --> 00:03:28,167
Just a simple meal

58
00:03:28,167 --> 00:03:30,333
Just tell me the situation.

59
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:39,367
Do your best and leave the rest to fate

60
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,733
Closed today

61
00:03:54,733 --> 00:03:55,733
I am coming

62
00:03:55,733 --> 00:03:57,800
Yeah, come in quickly.

63
00:03:58,633 --> 00:03:59,967
Welcome

64
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:03,800
What is Dad's flower like?

65
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,567
Mom, what's wrong with your clothes and hairstyle?

66
00:04:05,567 --> 00:04:06,833
What's the matter?

67
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:10,800
I usually wear it like this

68
00:04:11,333 --> 00:04:14,267
Nice to meet you, I'm Zhihui's father.

69
00:04:15,533 --> 00:04:18,367
Hello

70
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,700
I am the wise mother

71
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:27,433
Hello

72
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,700
Damn this

73
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,833
This is what he bought

74
00:04:33,833 --> 00:04:37,000
It would be nice if you just came. Why are you so polite?

75
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,133
Thank you

76
00:04:38,133 --> 00:04:41,900
Not only is he handsome, but he's also so considerate

77
00:04:43,233 --> 00:04:44,000
Come in

78
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,167
You must be hungry. Wait a minute.

79
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:00,500
Are you creating a son-in-law?

80
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,100
Hey, this is basic common sense.

81
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,867
How can you come to someone else's house empty-handed for the first time?

82
00:05:05,867 --> 00:05:07,600
Someone else's house?

83
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,133
Hey, I'll use a code word, you better tell the truth

84
00:05:12,733 --> 00:05:13,667
mom

85
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:15,567
Hey Mom

86
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:25,833
I'm sorry I didn't prepare some dishes.

87
00:05:25,833 --> 00:05:29,800
Because Zhihui asked me to cook it simply.

88
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:34,033
I prepared as usual, but set out an extra set of bowls and chopsticks.

89
00:05:34,533 --> 00:05:36,433
Cheating

90
00:05:36,433 --> 00:05:37,567
What

91
00:05:46,267 --> 00:05:47,600
fine

92
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:50,500
Wow, it's really rich.

93
00:05:51,833 --> 00:05:55,967
My mother never prepared such a big meal for me

94
00:05:55,967 --> 00:05:59,067
I really envy you, Miss Zhihui.

95
00:06:00,500 --> 00:06:04,233
These are all familiar dishes.

96
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,733
Eat quickly

97
00:06:10,467 --> 00:06:11,633
Let's get started

98
00:06:16,733 --> 00:06:18,133
Come and try this

99
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,767
Try this too

100
00:06:32,967 --> 00:06:36,700
Oh, you look so lucky when you eat.

101
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:41,100
Zhihui eats in small bites like her father

102
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,033
Come and try this

103
00:06:43,033 --> 00:06:45,967
Enough of this guy...

104
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,000
Not a guy...

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,367
My boyfriend will be very stressed.

106
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:59,333
Oh, did I do something wrong?

107
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,633
No

108
00:07:01,633 --> 00:07:03,133
Very delicious

109
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,767
My second daughter also eats everything with gusto.

110
00:07:08,767 --> 00:07:11,767
So whenever I see someone who loves to eat

111
00:07:11,767 --> 00:07:14,400
You'll accidentally get too excited

112
00:07:16,067 --> 00:07:18,967
Do you know our second daughter Zhien?

113
00:07:21,333 --> 00:07:24,000
Really, didn't you know it last time you saw it?

114
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,733
He goes to our house so often, he must have seen Zhien a long time ago.

115
00:07:28,733 --> 00:07:31,667
By the way, should I call Zhien?

116
00:07:31,667 --> 00:07:33,000
Do you want to try it?

117
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,500
Why did Dad call her?

118
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,833
You, the elder sister, treat your younger sister like an outsider.

119
00:07:39,833 --> 00:07:42,167
It would be nice if the whole family could greet each other and get closer.

120
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:43,433
Isn't it, husband?

121
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,533
Of course it's good to be close.

122
00:07:45,533 --> 00:07:47,967
Maybe he'll become my future brother-in-law.

123
00:07:50,100 --> 00:07:51,500
Brother-in-law?

124
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:59,233
What's wrong

125
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:36,867
mom

126
00:08:39,567 --> 00:08:41,267
mom

127
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,467
Why do this?

128
00:08:46,367 --> 00:08:47,800
mom

129
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,967
If you do that to me again, I'll be dead.

130
00:08:53,133 --> 00:08:54,667
I'm sorry.

131
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:56,133
sorry

132
00:08:57,233 --> 00:09:00,167
I said stop doing it.

133
00:09:12,433 --> 00:09:14,467
I told you that if you do it again, you'll be dead.

134
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,633
husband

135
00:09:17,633 --> 00:09:21,767
No, how could it be...

136
00:09:21,767 --> 00:09:23,433
sorry…

137
00:09:23,433 --> 00:09:25,067
Wait a minute

138
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:27,200
It's all your fault, Mom.

139
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
come on

140
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,467
Dad too

141
00:09:31,633 --> 00:09:35,000
It's okay... I'm sorry...

142
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,467
This kid is sensible.

143
00:09:36,467 --> 00:09:39,067
Ms Balance: Essential Nutritional Supplements for Menopausal Women

144
00:09:39,067 --> 00:09:41,800
(I’m sorry, try harder, son)
It's so touching that even I want to cry

145
00:09:44,067 --> 00:09:46,667
Wait...I'm sorry.

146
00:09:49,733 --> 00:09:53,867
I'm sorry you didn't have a good meal.

147
00:09:53,867 --> 00:09:55,033
It's okay

148
00:09:55,033 --> 00:09:57,333
It's all because we kept making noise while we were eating.

149
00:09:57,333 --> 00:09:59,133
How is your stomach?

150
00:09:59,133 --> 00:10:00,400
very good

151
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,833
I see you are a few centimeters taller.

152
00:10:06,833 --> 00:10:08,967
165 cm

153
00:10:08,967 --> 00:10:11,067
Is that all?

154
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:12,367
You look very tall.

155
00:10:12,367 --> 00:10:17,100
Because I have a small face, people often say this

156
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,167
Have some muscat grapes

157
00:10:22,467 --> 00:10:25,767
Where is my phone?

158
00:10:25,767 --> 00:10:28,200
Zhihui, have you seen dad's cell phone?

159
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
Cell phone?

160
00:10:37,433 --> 00:10:38,500
Here

161
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,867
Thank you

162
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,800
Come

163
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,667
Please eat fruit.

164
00:10:55,767 --> 00:10:56,867
Eat it

165
00:10:57,167 --> 00:10:59,433
Wife, what are you busy with?

166
00:10:59,433 --> 00:11:01,800
It's getting late, it's time to let the guests go home

167
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,833
I thought about it

168
00:11:04,833 --> 00:11:07,667
The cup Zhien gave me on my birthday

169
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:11,300
I only plan to take it out to entertain distinguished guests.

170
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:13,400
Today is the day, what are you waiting for?

171
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:17,267
Mom, no need, come here quickly.

172
00:11:17,267 --> 00:11:19,667
I have something to say

173
00:11:21,367 --> 00:11:22,467
What to say

174
00:11:24,467 --> 00:11:25,733
Oh my god

175
00:11:25,733 --> 00:11:27,600
Okay, I'll go wait for you.

176
00:11:44,567 --> 00:11:45,900
Are you okay?

177
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,567
Are you injured?

178
00:11:47,567 --> 00:11:51,433
Mom, I told you to move the heavy cups to the lower level.

179
00:11:51,433 --> 00:11:53,900
It's not that expensive, why collect it?

180
00:11:54,467 --> 00:11:56,533
Dad, didn't I say to replace this chair?

181
00:11:56,533 --> 00:11:58,233
They are so old that the legs of the chairs will shake

182
00:11:59,333 --> 00:12:02,233
Wait...what's the situation now?

183
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,233
husband

184
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:44,667
We Zhien like to eat oranges

185
00:12:45,767 --> 00:12:48,467
You go buy the best one.

186
00:12:48,867 --> 00:12:49,933
knew

187
00:12:49,933 --> 00:12:51,467
Dad, I'll go too.

188
00:13:24,367 --> 00:13:27,033
Are you okay? Are you scared?

189
00:13:29,267 --> 00:13:31,767
If I said I wasn't scared, I'd be lying.

190
00:13:45,267 --> 00:13:46,700
Mom, I'm sorry.

191
00:13:49,533 --> 00:13:52,033
Where did all that enthusiasm go when you helped me with my advanced education?

192
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:55,233
I was afraid you'd throw a party for me if you knew.

193
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:04,367
I've also experienced it myself

194
00:14:06,167 --> 00:14:08,067
I realized it's not that easy

195
00:14:11,867 --> 00:14:14,800
Anyway, I will recover like my mother.

196
00:14:15,933 --> 00:14:17,467
Time will solve everything

197
00:14:17,967 --> 00:14:19,167
Right

198
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:27,367
Anyway, I'm super handsome, right?

199
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,600
I often scare myself.

200
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:31,467
If it weren't for the trouble of becoming a man

201
00:14:31,467 --> 00:14:33,400
I should be very grateful to God

202
00:14:49,533 --> 00:14:51,167
Dad, are you okay?

203
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,200
Of course

204
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:59,400
Mom seems to be pretending nothing happened

205
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:02,767
If you keep pretending, everything will be fine.

206
00:15:03,567 --> 00:15:04,833
That's right

207
00:15:04,833 --> 00:15:06,200
Since it's like this

208
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,400
Dad, let me share a secret too.

209
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,800
What

210
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:13,900
Although Dad loves his two daughters the most

211
00:15:13,900 --> 00:15:16,767
But I also want to have another son.

212
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,000
Is this something to keep secret?

213
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,867
Until recently, my mother has tried hard

214
00:15:23,667 --> 00:15:27,700
Dad also had eel, raspberry and raw octopus...

215
00:15:27,700 --> 00:15:29,333
Okay, that's enough.

216
00:15:29,333 --> 00:15:30,767
OK

217
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:34,500
Although it is now an era where daughters are supreme

218
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:36,133
But those who have sons around

219
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,467
I can go to the bathhouse with my son.

220
00:15:38,467 --> 00:15:40,900
We can also play football together

221
00:15:40,900 --> 00:15:43,167
I'm both envious and jealous.

222
00:15:43,167 --> 00:15:44,433
dad

223
00:15:44,967 --> 00:15:47,733
Even if Ji Eun becomes a man

224
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,267
I will never go to the bathhouse with you.

225
00:15:52,433 --> 00:15:55,367
Of course, I am the same.

226
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:56,833
You really are

227
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:00,667
dad

228
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,700
The weather is nice

229
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:06,800
That's right

230
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,700
I heard from my son-in-law Jin

231
00:16:50,733 --> 00:16:51,800
It's fine

232
00:16:52,467 --> 00:16:54,633
It's bound to happen sooner or later anyway.

233
00:16:55,833 --> 00:16:57,933
If it hadn't happened to my daughter

234
00:16:57,933 --> 00:16:59,867
It's simply unimaginable.

235
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:04,267
This is all fate

236
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,733
(Job Hunting)

237
00:17:22,733 --> 00:17:24,833
(Coffee shop recruits full-time students)

238
00:17:28,833 --> 00:17:30,933
(Educational background is not limited, but ID and driver's license are required)

239
00:17:42,933 --> 00:17:45,100
Yun Jae doesn't know how prepared he is

240
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:52,633
It would be better if you could explain this concept more clearly.

241
00:17:52,633 --> 00:17:54,300
I know, I'll change it.

242
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,467
OK

243
00:17:56,333 --> 00:17:58,933
There's not much time left until the press conference, right?

244
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:02,133
What are you going to do tomorrow and why are you here?

245
00:18:02,133 --> 00:18:04,800
I need to explain this feeling in more detail.

246
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,200
knew

247
00:18:11,233 --> 00:18:12,433
Wait a minute

248
00:18:13,433 --> 00:18:14,633
Hey Zhien

249
00:18:15,533 --> 00:18:16,700
hateful

250
00:18:17,267 --> 00:18:19,767
Did meeting your parents go smoothly?

251
00:18:19,767 --> 00:18:22,867
Well, things didn't go according to plan.

252
00:18:22,867 --> 00:18:24,700
But the result is good

253
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,533
Are you preparing well?

254
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:27,700
Um

255
00:18:28,367 --> 00:18:29,800
I'm still in school

256
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,400
I also want to go to school

257
00:18:33,333 --> 00:18:35,367
Why is my fate so bumpy?

258
00:18:48,467 --> 00:18:49,567
Did you know

259
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:51,733
In quantum mechanics

260
00:18:51,733 --> 00:18:53,967
There is no such thing as destiny.

261
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:58,533
Because nothing exists until it is observed.

262
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:00,200
So the future of each of us

263
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,367
It changes based on what we see and choose.

264
00:19:03,367 --> 00:19:05,467
You can still talk about quantum mechanics at this time?

265
00:19:05,467 --> 00:19:08,500
When you feel that your fate is difficult

266
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:10,433
That moment is your choice

267
00:19:11,167 --> 00:19:12,533
When I'm sad

268
00:19:14,333 --> 00:19:16,133
I will think of Kim Ji-eun

269
00:19:16,133 --> 00:19:19,600
I think of you when I'm sad

270
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,267
It's also my own choice

271
00:19:22,833 --> 00:19:24,900
Then I'll feel inexplicably happy

272
00:19:25,767 --> 00:19:27,333
I'll be happy soon

273
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:30,767
Hope is in Jin Zhien's heart

274
00:19:30,767 --> 00:19:34,733
Park Yun-jae can also be that kind of choice

275
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:39,233
Why did Yun Jae come here in the middle of his report?

276
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,400
Time is running out

277
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,600
knew

278
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:45,733
Sorry,

279
00:19:45,733 --> 00:19:47,533
I'll call you back when I get home

280
00:19:47,533 --> 00:19:49,667
It's okay, just prepare carefully.

281
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:58,967
I haven't shared yet. The stars are beautiful tonight.

282
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:13,067
What to watch

283
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:16,000
Have you never seen a woman who was stood up?

284
00:20:22,967 --> 00:20:24,067
sorry

285
00:20:24,067 --> 00:20:25,600
I just took the subway

286
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,033
The train suddenly stopped

287
00:20:28,033 --> 00:20:30,067
Stopped for 32 minutes before driving again

288
00:20:35,633 --> 00:20:37,467
Really

289
00:20:37,467 --> 00:20:39,167
sorry

290
00:20:39,167 --> 00:20:41,033
I'm halfway through the online class.

291
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:42,867
My phone just ran out of battery.

292
00:20:42,867 --> 00:20:44,033
Really

293
00:20:44,033 --> 00:20:46,600
I'm not usually late.

294
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:48,300
I'm really sorry.

295
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:49,900
sorry

296
00:20:56,300 --> 00:20:58,467
I really want to give you a sports car

297
00:20:58,467 --> 00:21:00,600
You don't have to take the subway.

298
00:21:01,833 --> 00:21:03,433
Aren't you angry?

299
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:06,033
I wanted to be angry

300
00:21:06,033 --> 00:21:07,900
But the food is delicious

301
00:21:09,267 --> 00:21:11,733
The moonlight is so beautiful that I can't get angry anymore

302
00:21:21,633 --> 00:21:23,567
(Shengsan Grocery Store)

303
00:21:28,700 --> 00:21:30,300
The moon is so beautiful

304
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:41,800
(Another pack)

305
00:21:50,833 --> 00:21:51,767
(Another pack)

306
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,467
Not so lucky.

307
00:22:01,767 --> 00:22:02,900
(Another pack)

308
00:22:10,933 --> 00:22:12,433
Lady Luck

309
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:16,300
If you were here, could I see Hong Young-seok again?

310
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,233
If you don't want to agree, forget it.

311
00:22:19,233 --> 00:22:21,800
Please, please let me see him once.

312
00:22:40,133 --> 00:22:41,833
You are so happy

313
00:22:41,833 --> 00:22:43,267
Of course

314
00:22:43,267 --> 00:22:45,333
I love home-cooked meals.

315
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,833
You tell me honestly

316
00:22:50,833 --> 00:22:52,467
Do you like home cooking?

317
00:22:52,467 --> 00:22:53,867
Still like Zhixun

318
00:22:53,867 --> 00:22:55,033
I like both

319
00:22:55,033 --> 00:22:58,000
I love both home cooking and Zhixun.

320
00:23:00,667 --> 00:23:02,867
I like it so much, it's too exaggerated.

321
00:23:10,333 --> 00:23:12,767
If your mother doesn't open a beauty salon but a shop selling snacks

322
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:14,267
The money you earn can build a building.

323
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:16,333
Put it in the bowl for you to eat.

324
00:23:16,333 --> 00:23:18,300
Don't be lazy and eat it directly

325
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,433
Okay

326
00:23:20,433 --> 00:23:22,867
Yun Jae and his friends will come to my house later

327
00:23:22,867 --> 00:23:24,467
I can understand Yun Jae going to your house.

328
00:23:24,467 --> 00:23:26,267
But what about his friend?

329
00:23:26,267 --> 00:23:28,233
It's his younger brother who works with him.

330
00:23:28,233 --> 00:23:31,367
I owe him a lot and want to treat him to a meal

331
00:23:31,367 --> 00:23:34,733
Is it the friend who flirts with other women, talks a lot and always gets into trouble?

332
00:23:34,733 --> 00:23:36,500
No, after actually getting along

333
00:23:36,500 --> 00:23:39,500
He's a bit noisy but a nice guy.

334
00:23:39,500 --> 00:23:42,433
But you still invited him to your home?

335
00:23:43,433 --> 00:23:44,500
Are you okay?

336
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:47,600
Well, it just so happens that my sister is going to attend the funeral after work.

337
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,133
No, I don't mean this.

338
00:23:50,133 --> 00:23:52,067
Are you ready?

339
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:56,267
My mom marinated the roast beef for me and I plan to grill that.

340
00:23:56,267 --> 00:23:57,700
No

341
00:24:01,967 --> 00:24:03,967
Have you collected all this stuff?

342
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:12,133
Hello

343
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:13,467
I'm leaving first.

344
00:24:15,567 --> 00:24:16,833
Walk slowly

345
00:25:26,567 --> 00:25:28,067
Perfect

346
00:25:37,000 --> 00:25:38,467
You are here

347
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:39,733
Brother Zhixun

348
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:43,233
Thank you for inviting me

349
00:25:45,233 --> 00:25:47,267
Come on in...

350
00:25:47,267 --> 00:25:49,000
Why are you pushing me in?

351
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,500
Come in

352
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,033
Wait a minute, what's going on?

353
00:26:02,933 --> 00:26:04,667
What smells so strong?

354
00:26:08,767 --> 00:26:11,400
Did you break the perfume bottle?

355
00:26:11,400 --> 00:26:12,300
It smells good, right?

356
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:14,800
This is the number one selling Olive Young male fragrance

357
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,567
Giselle Homme No.5

358
00:26:20,700 --> 00:26:22,767
But your house is really clean.

359
00:26:22,767 --> 00:26:24,233
No dust at all

360
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,900
This is just basic.

361
00:26:26,900 --> 00:26:27,967
Min Hyuk

362
00:26:27,967 --> 00:26:29,867
Could you please sit on the sofa first?

363
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,933
How is this

364
00:26:49,933 --> 00:26:52,467
Why did you leave your underwear here?

365
00:26:52,467 --> 00:26:53,767
Oh, really.

366
00:26:53,767 --> 00:26:55,333
I forgot to receive it.

367
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:58,800
I'm such a confused guy.

368
00:27:00,833 --> 00:27:03,800
Could it be that she is hiding it with her underwear?

369
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,067
Min Hyuk

370
00:27:06,067 --> 00:27:08,700
You can read the magazine before I finish cooking.

371
00:27:09,533 --> 00:27:11,167
I want to watch too.

372
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,667
You'll also watch these

373
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:17,833
Of course

374
00:27:17,833 --> 00:27:20,533
Boys should at least know how to read these.

375
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:24,700
Brother Zhixun

376
00:27:26,033 --> 00:27:27,700
You are so handsome

377
00:27:30,967 --> 00:27:32,900
You sit and wait for a moment

378
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,100
good

379
00:27:54,133 --> 00:27:55,567
Look

380
00:27:55,567 --> 00:27:57,733
It's a flower

381
00:27:57,733 --> 00:27:59,167
Thanks

382
00:28:03,100 --> 00:28:05,167
Your house is so clean

383
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,533
There is also a fragrance

384
00:28:08,533 --> 00:28:09,933
Yeah

385
00:28:09,933 --> 00:28:11,500
This is just basic.

386
00:28:12,333 --> 00:28:13,467
Are you hungry?

387
00:28:13,467 --> 00:28:15,000
Sit on the sofa first.

388
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:16,167
good

389
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,300
Here, drink this for you.

390
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,467
Thanks

391
00:28:37,733 --> 00:28:40,433
(20% off, 12,000 yuan)

392
00:28:52,167 --> 00:28:54,067
Cheers

393
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:02,533
I don't know if it suits your taste.

394
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:04,900
Did you do all this yourself?

395
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,333
I quite like cooking

396
00:29:06,333 --> 00:29:08,800
You are absolutely my ideal lover.

397
00:29:09,700 --> 00:29:11,300
What ideal lover

398
00:29:11,300 --> 00:29:12,867
He's just a brother.

399
00:29:14,933 --> 00:29:18,167
How long have you known each other?

400
00:29:18,167 --> 00:29:19,367
Are you a college classmate?

401
00:29:19,367 --> 00:29:21,233
A little more than a year

402
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:22,567
453 days

403
00:29:22,567 --> 00:29:24,567
Do you still count the days we've known each other?

404
00:29:24,567 --> 00:29:25,800
Hey Min Hyuk

405
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:27,533
This dish is super delicious, try it!

406
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:28,667
Open your mouth

407
00:29:28,667 --> 00:29:29,867
So good

408
00:29:29,867 --> 00:29:31,933
I ate it myself, why?

409
00:29:31,933 --> 00:29:33,833
He just looks gentle.

410
00:29:33,833 --> 00:29:36,333
The words and actions are extremely rude.

411
00:29:37,167 --> 00:29:39,133
He never treats me rudely.

412
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,400
So how did he treat you?

413
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:52,033
It seems someone is coming

414
00:29:52,033 --> 00:29:53,000
Wait me a moment

415
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:54,600
good

416
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:55,800
I am coming

417
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:02,700
You are here

418
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,400
Thank you Yuri

419
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,067
I'm really tired

420
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:15,067
Hello, I'm Lee Min Hyuk

421
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,833
He's a colleague who works with Yun Jae.

422
00:30:17,833 --> 00:30:19,533
Hello, I'm...

423
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:22,300
Wow, your glasses are too big.

424
00:30:23,033 --> 00:30:25,233
But there's no lens.

425
00:30:25,233 --> 00:30:26,433
Damn

426
00:30:29,900 --> 00:30:32,267
Really, yeah

427
00:30:32,267 --> 00:30:33,600
Excuse me

428
00:30:34,833 --> 00:30:36,667
This is my friend Choi Yu-ri

429
00:30:36,667 --> 00:30:38,500
We've known each other since elementary school.

430
00:30:38,500 --> 00:30:40,367
This is my boyfriend Yun Jae

431
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:43,300
Boyfriend?

432
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,533
That's not wrong.

433
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,000
Hello, my boyfriend, Mr. Park Yun-jae

434
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,300
I am his female friend Choi Yuri

435
00:31:00,133 --> 00:31:01,900
I've long heard of you.

436
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:06,167
Yes, I have also long admired your name.

437
00:31:07,167 --> 00:31:12,433
We raise unicorns together.

438
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:18,500
yes

439
00:31:20,467 --> 00:31:22,000
Where are the unicorns?

440
00:31:23,700 --> 00:31:25,067
Hello

441
00:31:25,067 --> 00:31:28,567
I heard you met at a social gathering.

442
00:31:32,233 --> 00:31:34,433
Who are you referring to?

443
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,100
How do three men get together?

444
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:41,400
Yuri seems drunk

445
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:44,000
Hey, stop drinking.

446
00:31:45,233 --> 00:31:46,900
This is alcohol-free.

447
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,267
Feel sorry

448
00:31:54,700 --> 00:31:56,300
So happy

449
00:32:01,033 --> 00:32:03,067
Please invite me often.

450
00:32:05,067 --> 00:32:07,933
Let's see about this later.

451
00:32:13,067 --> 00:32:14,567
Hey, stop pushing.

452
00:32:21,433 --> 00:32:23,233
Sorry, what's going on?

453
00:32:23,233 --> 00:32:25,300
It sprayed on Zhixun's clothes

454
00:32:25,300 --> 00:32:28,567
It's okay. It's too hot anyway. I wanted to change anyway.

455
00:32:29,433 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm going to change my clothes

456
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:38,000
I also need to go to the toilet

457
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,667
what

458
00:32:43,667 --> 00:32:45,267
Hello, it's not me

459
00:32:52,167 --> 00:32:53,267
Hello

460
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,900
What's wrong

461
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:07,333
There's no toilet paper in the toilet

462
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:08,500
Yeah

463
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,400
Wait a moment

464
00:33:13,767 --> 00:33:16,300
Hey, are you really drinking non-alcoholic?

465
00:33:16,300 --> 00:33:17,867
Very red face

466
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:20,800
Even my ears are red

467
00:33:22,567 --> 00:33:23,967
It's so hot

468
00:33:25,367 --> 00:33:27,167
What about friendship?

469
00:33:28,467 --> 00:33:30,133
Be careful

470
00:33:31,367 --> 00:33:32,367
Um

471
00:33:33,433 --> 00:33:35,000
I don't drink anymore

472
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,967
Did you three go down there and have a fight?

473
00:34:23,967 --> 00:34:25,767
What's wrong?

474
00:34:25,767 --> 00:34:27,067
fine

475
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:33,133
I'm probably tired because I haven't drunk in a long time.

476
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,133
It's time to go

477
00:34:36,133 --> 00:34:38,633
Yeah, good idea.

478
00:34:38,633 --> 00:34:40,467
Let's go

479
00:34:40,467 --> 00:34:42,233
What? It's just starting now.

480
00:34:42,733 --> 00:34:44,667
Brother Zhixun, can I stay a little longer?

481
00:34:46,133 --> 00:34:48,133
I'm a little tired too

482
00:34:48,133 --> 00:34:50,000
I haven't even started yet

483
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,600
Let's play again.

484
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:53,800
Okay

485
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,400
(Yuli 3)

486
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:57,300
Who is Yuri 3?

487
00:34:58,867 --> 00:35:01,100
Yuli 1 Yuli 2 Yuli 3

488
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,467
Yuli 4

489
00:35:04,167 --> 00:35:06,000
Um now?

490
00:35:08,267 --> 00:35:10,067
Do you miss your brother?

491
00:35:10,067 --> 00:35:11,467
Yuri

492
00:35:14,267 --> 00:35:15,500
Um

493
00:35:20,167 --> 00:35:23,167
Hey, keep your boyfriend under control.

494
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:26,500
As the saying goes, birds of a feather flock together.

495
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:28,167
What do you want to say?

496
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:33,600
It means that you can't be too careless if your boyfriend has a sea king by his side.

497
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:36,700
Hey, what do you think of our Yunzai?

498
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,433
This line is really good

499
00:35:38,433 --> 00:35:40,300
Can I use it as the subject of my next work?

500
00:35:40,300 --> 00:35:43,333
A love thriller

501
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:52,133
But it's so late, we have to call a taxi.

502
00:35:52,133 --> 00:35:53,633
Where is your home?

503
00:35:53,633 --> 00:35:54,400
Me?

504
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:56,700
Yuri is going to sleep at my house today

505
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,600
So that's it

506
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:03,567
It was originally like this

507
00:36:03,567 --> 00:36:07,433
But it seems better to go home and sleep

508
00:36:07,433 --> 00:36:09,667
If you leave now, you might end up falling asleep in a dangerous place.

509
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,467
Don't make me worry, just sleep here.

510
00:36:13,533 --> 00:36:14,767
That's it

511
00:36:14,767 --> 00:36:18,933
It's so late, it's safer to sleep at a friend's house

512
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,133
Come in quickly

513
00:36:30,133 --> 00:36:31,333
Um

514
00:36:31,967 --> 00:36:33,567
Come in

515
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:41,467
Let's go

516
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:01,167
I'm waiting for this moment when we're alone

517
00:37:01,167 --> 00:37:03,700
Choi Yuri, we are friends

518
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:05,000
This can't be done

519
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,233
Do I still look like your friend?

520
00:37:10,633 --> 00:37:14,633
Look how well we two match.

521
00:37:18,933 --> 00:37:21,233
No, no

522
00:37:21,233 --> 00:37:24,167
What am I thinking about?

523
00:37:24,167 --> 00:37:26,100
They have been friends since elementary school.

524
00:37:28,467 --> 00:37:29,700
We've been friends since elementary school, so what?

525
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:31,333
Why would a single man or a single woman care so much?

526
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,633
It's not like we're alone

527
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:42,233
Park Yun-jae

528
00:37:43,167 --> 00:37:44,533
Sober up

529
00:37:45,533 --> 00:37:47,333
Are you possessed by a demon?

530
00:37:58,367 --> 00:37:59,900
Just sleep in bed together.

531
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,300
What

532
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,733
Why are you so surprised?

533
00:38:02,733 --> 00:38:04,267
Didn't you sleep like this before?

534
00:38:06,533 --> 00:38:09,633
But I'm older, so it's better for me to sleep on the floor

535
00:38:11,467 --> 00:38:12,467
Um

536
00:38:13,633 --> 00:38:15,367
Then I'll sleep first

537
00:38:15,967 --> 00:38:17,033
Going to bed so early?

538
00:38:17,033 --> 00:38:20,300
Maybe I drank too much and I feel a little tired

539
00:38:21,367 --> 00:38:23,333
You didn't drink

540
00:38:25,667 --> 00:38:28,967
Hey, let's chat for a while before going to sleep.

541
00:38:49,667 --> 00:38:52,367
Hey, quit drinking alcohol too.

542
00:39:52,467 --> 00:39:57,400
This damn life is gone just because I'm busy attending funerals

543
00:39:59,167 --> 00:40:04,167
There haven't been any exciting events since the first birthday party.

544
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,967
Excuse me, can you lend me a light?

545
00:40:19,567 --> 00:40:20,967
Thanks

546
00:40:32,567 --> 00:40:33,900
You are not...

547
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:36,733
You are Jin Zhihui who used to sit next to me, right?

548
00:40:41,267 --> 00:40:43,200
Hong…Hong Young-seok

549
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:45,433
You haven't changed.

550
00:40:45,433 --> 00:40:47,100
But do you recognize me?

551
00:40:47,100 --> 00:40:49,633
I've changed a lot, I'm probably hard to recognize.

552
00:40:51,367 --> 00:40:52,567
How is that possible?

553
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:54,500
Is he really a human?

554
00:40:55,367 --> 00:40:56,667
Really handsome

555
00:40:58,133 --> 00:40:59,167
What are you doing?

556
00:40:59,167 --> 00:41:00,333
Is he Hong Young-suk?

557
00:41:01,367 --> 00:41:03,367
Who is the girl behind him?

558
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:04,333
How is she

559
00:41:04,333 --> 00:41:05,633
Why are you glaring at us?

560
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,033
You hold the book upside down.

561
00:41:19,033 --> 00:41:20,233
(Absurd Philosophy)

562
00:41:21,900 --> 00:41:23,867
I like reading books backwards.

563
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:26,633
This stimulates my reverse thinking.

564
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,033
It's true

565
00:41:28,867 --> 00:41:29,700
Did I say anything?

566
00:41:32,967 --> 00:41:35,533
Stop looking at me and go to sleep.

567
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:38,100
I like watching you too

568
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,200
Because it's funny

569
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:46,633
Then I'm going to sleep

570
00:42:06,333 --> 00:42:08,633
You're the same as before, you haven't changed at all

571
00:42:10,167 --> 00:42:10,900
Yeah

572
00:42:14,267 --> 00:42:15,267
No wonder people say

573
00:42:15,267 --> 00:42:16,533
Old friends are best

574
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,400
Are you really the same as before?

575
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,767
But why did you come to the hospital?

576
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:23,367
Attending the farewell ceremony?

577
00:42:24,933 --> 00:42:27,567
Yes, because my colleague's mother passed away.

578
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:29,233
What about you?

579
00:42:29,933 --> 00:42:31,733
I...because of my dad

580
00:42:34,733 --> 00:42:36,000
Anyway, I'm very happy to meet you Zhihui

581
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:49,900
What's so funny?

582
00:42:51,867 --> 00:42:55,600
Summarize your first love in one sentence

583
00:42:55,600 --> 00:42:57,533
Just smoking together at the entrance of the farewell ceremony?

584
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:02,400
But kind of sexy.

585
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:04,400
No longer the innocent and naive days

586
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:07,633
It's about a meeting between a man and a woman in their thirties, tainted by the world and cigarettes.

587
00:43:09,100 --> 00:43:10,167
Quite cute

588
00:43:12,633 --> 00:43:15,333
What do you think is interesting?

589
00:43:15,333 --> 00:43:16,767
So what is he doing?

590
00:43:16,767 --> 00:43:18,233
Are you married?

591
00:43:18,233 --> 00:43:19,500
Did you ask for his phone number?

592
00:43:21,667 --> 00:43:23,367
No way

593
00:43:23,367 --> 00:43:24,567
He's your first love.

594
00:43:24,567 --> 00:43:26,733
It's not like they only smoke face to face...

595
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:29,167
No way

596
00:43:32,800 --> 00:43:34,500
How have you been lately?

597
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:38,400
I'm just an office worker

598
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,400
Go to work

599
00:43:43,167 --> 00:43:44,067
That…

600
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:47,767
I said it out of guilt.

601
00:43:47,767 --> 00:43:49,300
Actually, I haven't passed the civil service exam yet.

602
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:51,933
Failed seven times

603
00:43:51,933 --> 00:43:54,367
This year I will take the exam for the eighth time

604
00:44:03,500 --> 00:44:04,833
This is also possible.

605
00:44:08,433 --> 00:44:09,633
There is an idiom that goes "all over the place".

606
00:44:09,633 --> 00:44:10,800
You will definitely have a good result, Hong Young-seok

607
00:44:10,800 --> 00:44:11,967
come on

608
00:44:16,333 --> 00:44:17,300
Thank you Zhihui

609
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:23,567
Is that all?

610
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,900
I'm hopeless, right?

611
00:44:28,833 --> 00:44:30,433
I simply...

612
00:44:30,433 --> 00:44:32,233
A big idiot, right?

613
00:44:41,133 --> 00:44:42,400
What are you doing suddenly

614
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:43,600
This is yesterday's Zhihui sister

615
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,500
I really can't describe it in words

616
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:46,767
So express it this way

617
00:44:51,833 --> 00:44:53,067
Are you guys done yet?

618
00:44:53,833 --> 00:44:55,567
Throw away the toilet paper immediately.

619
00:44:55,567 --> 00:44:56,933
You clean up the leftovers.

620
00:44:56,933 --> 00:44:57,867
Then go buy ice cream and come back now

621
00:44:57,867 --> 00:44:58,967
Now action

622
00:44:58,967 --> 00:44:59,800
Now action

623
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:01,467
Now action

624
00:45:01,467 --> 00:45:02,700
Buy it now and take action

625
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,967
So funny

626
00:45:05,567 --> 00:45:06,567
That's enough

627
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,967
You girl

628
00:45:17,933 --> 00:45:19,200
My clothes are wet

629
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:27,767
It will happen anyway

630
00:45:27,767 --> 00:45:29,000
Come here quickly

631
00:45:53,833 --> 00:45:55,400
My friend is much prettier now.

632
00:46:01,533 --> 00:46:03,133
I'm going to buy some ice cream. What do you want to eat?

633
00:46:05,133 --> 00:46:06,067
casual

634
00:46:07,233 --> 00:46:09,300
Then I'll just buy a smoothie bar.

635
00:46:10,133 --> 00:46:11,233
good

636
00:46:11,233 --> 00:46:12,733
Sister, you want chocolate flavor, right?

637
00:46:12,733 --> 00:46:13,633
right

638
00:46:29,133 --> 00:46:29,933
Yuli

639
00:46:35,867 --> 00:46:37,267
People think

640
00:46:37,267 --> 00:46:40,300
The green light is the beginning of a good impression

641
00:46:40,933 --> 00:46:42,600
But in my experience

642
00:46:42,600 --> 00:46:45,167
The real danger is the red light

643
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:50,267
What are you suddenly saying?

644
00:46:51,367 --> 00:46:53,100
When do you think the red light will turn on?

645
00:46:54,300 --> 00:46:55,867
When you can't cross the road

646
00:46:55,867 --> 00:46:57,900
Shouldn't step on it

647
00:46:57,900 --> 00:46:59,467
The red light will turn on when there is still danger

648
00:47:06,667 --> 00:47:07,500
Be careful

649
00:47:08,533 --> 00:47:10,267
You've got the warning light on.

650
00:47:19,567 --> 00:47:20,800
No…

651
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:22,233
No...

652
00:47:28,167 --> 00:47:30,933
(Application for Leave of Absence)

653
00:47:42,667 --> 00:47:46,467
(Application for Leave of Absence Name: Kim Ji-eun)

654
00:47:51,367 --> 00:47:52,667
Hello, professor.

655
00:47:55,133 --> 00:47:57,167
Your report is amazing.

656
00:47:57,167 --> 00:47:57,933
Really

657
00:47:57,933 --> 00:47:59,900
Yes, very interesting

658
00:48:00,933 --> 00:48:01,733
Well done

659
00:48:01,733 --> 00:48:02,700
Thank you, Professor

660
00:48:04,633 --> 00:48:05,633
Hello, professor.

661
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:11,833
This is very eye-catching, Mr. Park.

662
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:16,533
This is research I've never seen before.

663
00:48:17,500 --> 00:48:18,933
What kind of data do you use for analysis?

664
00:48:20,700 --> 00:48:24,767
My paper results using the far ultraviolet telescope FIMS

665
00:48:24,767 --> 00:48:26,200
To create this chart

666
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,000
I see. Thank you.

667
00:48:30,567 --> 00:48:32,267
Can I take a picture?

668
00:48:32,267 --> 00:48:33,567
Of course it would be great.

669
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:49,100
2024 Korean Astronomical Society Yeonhee University Symposium

670
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:56,400
(Park Yun-jae)

671
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:02,433
Park Yoon-jae is amazing

672
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:05,900
But where did he go?

673
00:49:14,633 --> 00:49:15,533
It ended successfully

674
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:27,400
let's go

675
00:49:27,400 --> 00:49:28,200
OK

676
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:38,233
How come you came without saying a word?

677
00:49:38,733 --> 00:49:40,933
I just happened to be passing by.

678
00:49:40,933 --> 00:49:42,667
You are Yun Jae's friend, right?

679
00:49:42,667 --> 00:49:44,500
We met last time at a nightclub

680
00:49:46,633 --> 00:49:48,433
Good for you

681
00:49:51,733 --> 00:49:52,600
What's that behind you?

682
00:49:52,600 --> 00:49:53,500
What

683
00:49:55,100 --> 00:49:56,500
nothing

684
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:58,033
You must be very busy, go back quickly

685
00:49:58,033 --> 00:49:59,167
What?

686
00:49:59,167 --> 00:50:00,733
Now that we are here, of course we have to take a look around before leaving.

687
00:50:00,733 --> 00:50:01,433
No need

688
00:50:01,433 --> 00:50:03,767
I really just happened to be passing by and didn't plan to stay long.

689
00:50:05,033 --> 00:50:05,967
Then go get busy.

690
00:50:17,033 --> 00:50:18,300
What's going on?

691
00:50:34,167 --> 00:50:35,867
They're all my favorites.

692
00:50:35,867 --> 00:50:37,267
It must be delicious

693
00:50:38,433 --> 00:50:40,367
Haven't you had lunch?

694
00:50:42,533 --> 00:50:44,800
I didn't eat much because it was too bad.

695
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:47,067
Don't force it.

696
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:49,400
Drink some water

697
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:54,533
This is delicious.

698
00:50:56,133 --> 00:50:57,833
Don't try to snatch it from me.

699
00:50:57,833 --> 00:50:59,633
I will eat it all

700
00:51:03,867 --> 00:51:05,433
I won't compete with you.

701
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:07,967
Eat slowly

702
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,433
Drink some water

703
00:51:14,200 --> 00:51:18,600
"I'm very excited"

704
00:51:20,300 --> 00:51:22,767
"I like it because of you"

705
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:25,733
Hello

706
00:51:25,733 --> 00:51:28,200
What models did you use?

707
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,800
Based on Gaussian function plus multi-fitting

708
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:34,067
very good

709
00:51:34,067 --> 00:51:34,767
Thank you

710
00:51:34,767 --> 00:51:36,167
Thank you too

711
00:51:38,167 --> 00:51:39,600
Hi

712
00:51:39,600 --> 00:51:43,033
How much have you understood?

713
00:51:43,033 --> 00:51:45,367
Three angstroms

714
00:51:45,367 --> 00:51:47,367
I understand. Thank you.

715
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:48,933
very beautiful

716
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:52,733
Can we take a photo with the students?

717
00:51:52,733 --> 00:51:53,767
sure

718
00:51:53,767 --> 00:51:56,167
Let's go this way

719
00:52:00,367 --> 00:52:02,333
Are you ready?

720
00:52:02,333 --> 00:52:05,000
one two three

721
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:06,967
very good

722
00:52:06,967 --> 00:52:07,700
Thanks

723
00:52:07,700 --> 00:52:09,033
Thank you, thank you

724
00:52:09,033 --> 00:52:10,533
Nice to meet you Nice to meet you

725
00:52:10,533 --> 00:52:12,300
Thank you and nice to meet you

726
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:13,333
Thanks

727
00:52:13,333 --> 00:52:14,867
goodbye

728
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:16,167
Thanks

729
00:52:31,467 --> 00:52:33,467
Thanks for your hard work…

730
00:52:43,067 --> 00:52:44,300
How are you

731
00:52:45,033 --> 00:52:46,200
Are you okay?

732
00:53:02,167 --> 00:53:04,100
Is that the conch shop at the door?

733
00:53:04,100 --> 00:53:05,800
You don't eat conch.

734
00:53:05,800 --> 00:53:06,933
yes

735
00:53:08,567 --> 00:53:11,233
But because the professor is here, it's not good to be absent

736
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:13,433
Don't drink too much

737
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:15,667
Um

738
00:53:15,667 --> 00:53:17,900
I'll call you back when I'm done

739
00:53:17,900 --> 00:53:20,167
Your voice sounds weird.

740
00:53:20,167 --> 00:53:21,833
Are you feeling unwell?

741
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:25,033
fine

742
00:53:25,033 --> 00:53:27,300
Maybe I'm too nervous today.

743
00:53:28,867 --> 00:53:30,567
I have to go in.

744
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:32,167
Good to know

745
00:53:38,300 --> 00:53:39,633
Hello

746
00:53:40,467 --> 00:53:41,733
Yunzai

747
00:53:42,800 --> 00:53:44,100
Park Yun-jae

748
00:53:46,967 --> 00:53:48,300
Did you hang up?

749
00:53:52,200 --> 00:53:53,533
Yun Jae

750
00:53:54,067 --> 00:53:56,233
Bro, what's wrong with you?

751
00:53:56,233 --> 00:53:58,667
Wake up, brother

752
00:53:58,667 --> 00:53:59,667
(My Greatest Grace)
Yun Jae

753
00:53:59,667 --> 00:54:00,967
Yun Jae, are you okay?

754
00:54:00,967 --> 00:54:02,767
Yun Jae Brother Park Yun Jae

755
00:54:20,700 --> 00:54:22,567
What happened to him

756
00:54:22,567 --> 00:54:24,200
The doctor said it was indigestion

757
00:54:25,100 --> 00:54:26,867
But how did you know to come to the hospital?

758
00:54:26,867 --> 00:54:28,167
Park Yun-jae

759
00:54:28,167 --> 00:54:30,567
Get up quickly, Park Yun-jae

760
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:34,067
Yun Jae...

761
00:54:34,067 --> 00:54:35,967
Oh my god, husband

762
00:54:35,967 --> 00:54:41,733
Yun Jae...

763
00:54:41,733 --> 00:54:44,667
Wake up, mom is here.

764
00:54:46,567 --> 00:54:50,100
Wait, you're the friend from last time, right?

765
00:54:50,100 --> 00:54:52,867
Take him home after getting him drunk

766
00:54:52,867 --> 00:54:55,467
Obviously looks like a human being

767
00:54:55,467 --> 00:54:57,933
Looks like they're having a lot of fun.

768
00:54:57,933 --> 00:54:59,800
sorry

769
00:54:59,800 --> 00:55:01,167
Hello

770
00:55:03,367 --> 00:55:04,900
Who are you

771
00:55:04,900 --> 00:55:08,133
I'm Yun Jae's junior and I just called you.

772
00:55:08,133 --> 00:55:11,600
He just came here

773
00:55:11,600 --> 00:55:13,400
Yun Jae is at the seminar celebration party

774
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,567
I fainted because of indigestion.

775
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:17,067
Everything else is normal

776
00:55:17,067 --> 00:55:19,300
He can be discharged from the hospital when he wakes up.

777
00:55:20,933 --> 00:55:22,033
Really

778
00:55:22,033 --> 00:55:24,900
What's the point of only giving you organic food?

779
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:27,367
It's not because of indigestion caused by eating random things outside

780
00:55:27,367 --> 00:55:29,233
Really

781
00:55:31,167 --> 00:55:34,767
Yun Jae...

782
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:36,100
Wake up

783
00:55:36,100 --> 00:55:38,800
Mom is here, please lend me some money.

784
00:55:40,033 --> 00:55:41,833
So many people came

785
00:55:42,633 --> 00:55:45,133
My girlfriend might be scared.

786
00:55:53,433 --> 00:55:55,833
Well...

787
00:55:56,533 --> 00:55:57,967
I…

788
00:56:00,133 --> 00:56:04,767
I have a crush on my brother

789
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:10,433
Ouch

790
00:56:10,433 --> 00:56:14,433
You mean Yunzai's schoolmate?

791
00:56:14,433 --> 00:56:16,233
So beautiful

792
00:56:16,233 --> 00:56:18,733
You're also good at studying, right?

793
00:56:19,667 --> 00:56:22,000
Although the occasion is not right

794
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,967
Anyway, nice to meet you

795
00:56:23,967 --> 00:56:27,500
I have to treat you and Yunzai to a meal.

796
00:56:27,500 --> 00:56:30,400
Really? That's great.

797
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:33,600
Oh my god

798
00:56:33,600 --> 00:56:36,033
We allow you to be around

799
00:56:36,033 --> 00:56:39,267
There is such a smart and pretty lady

800
00:56:40,867 --> 00:56:43,700
You don't know either, right?

801
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:46,400
Yeah, I don't know at all.

802
00:56:47,167 --> 00:56:49,900
Yun Jae is very popular, you guys didn't know that

803
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,067
Uncle and aunt, do you want me to buy you some drinks?

804
00:56:54,067 --> 00:56:55,633
You must be pretty scared.

805
00:56:55,633 --> 00:56:57,333
Please wait here for a moment.

806
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:58,500
Excuse me

807
00:57:02,133 --> 00:57:06,333
As far as I know, Yun Jae has a girlfriend.

808
00:57:15,233 --> 00:57:16,733
Oh my god, you haven't left yet.

809
00:57:16,733 --> 00:57:19,067
Yun Jae has a girlfriend

810
00:57:21,567 --> 00:57:23,533
Did I say anything?

811
00:57:23,533 --> 00:57:25,767
No, everyone misunderstood now.

812
00:57:25,767 --> 00:57:29,300
You also told the hospital that you were Yun Jae's girlfriend.

813
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:32,600
Because if we're just friends, it doesn't seem urgent enough.

814
00:57:32,600 --> 00:57:35,167
That's why she claimed to be his girlfriend

815
00:57:36,033 --> 00:57:38,600
Is there anything wrong with this?

816
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:40,567
You're lying.

817
00:57:44,033 --> 00:57:46,367
What does it have to do with you?

818
00:57:46,367 --> 00:57:48,967
I thought you were Yun Jae's girlfriend.

819
00:57:53,367 --> 00:57:56,467
What I mean is…

820
00:57:56,467 --> 00:57:58,633
You made the situation so complicated.

821
00:57:58,633 --> 00:58:01,900
How panicked Yun Jae will be when he wakes up

822
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:03,333
As Yun Jae's friend, I'm just worried about him...

823
00:58:03,333 --> 00:58:06,967
Seriously, not all of them are lies.

824
00:58:08,133 --> 00:58:09,833
What do you mean?

825
00:58:11,700 --> 00:58:14,367
Even though I'm not his girlfriend yet

826
00:58:14,367 --> 00:58:17,100
One day it will be

827
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:22,267
Please wait a little longer.

828
00:58:22,267 --> 00:58:24,333
After I become Yun Jae's girlfriend

829
00:58:24,333 --> 00:58:26,533
I will go to eat with you again instead of as a schoolmate.

830
00:58:26,533 --> 00:58:29,967
Good food can be eaten anytime

831
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:31,600
But you mean...

832
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:35,700
Is our Yunzai's girlfriend someone else?

833
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:37,167
If even the parents don't know

834
00:58:37,167 --> 00:58:39,367
It means they are not seriously dating.

835
00:58:39,367 --> 00:58:42,000
Don't worry, I'll take good care of him.

836
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:46,500
Very serious relationship, love to death

837
00:58:49,633 --> 00:58:51,733
How can I believe your one-sided words?

838
00:58:51,733 --> 00:58:53,200
Can only believe

839
00:58:53,900 --> 00:58:57,667
Because I am Park Yoon-jae's girlfriend

840
00:59:20,533 --> 00:59:23,533
(Thanks to Yoon Joo-sang for his special appearance)

841
00:59:53,533 --> 00:59:57,667
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

842
00:59:57,667 --> 00:59:59,367
I really want to kiss you

843
00:59:59,367 --> 01:00:02,100
What is the relationship between me and Kim Ji-hoon?

844
01:00:02,100 --> 01:00:03,433
Why do you ask that?

845
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,967
Don't I like you?

846
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:07,533
Don't get involved with her. I really don't like her.

847
01:00:07,533 --> 01:00:09,400
If you want to break up with Jin Zhien

848
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:11,867
But I'm sorry to bring this up.

849
01:00:11,867 --> 01:00:14,133
I miss you so much

850
01:00:14,133 --> 01:00:15,600
How am I

851
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:18,767
Since it's like this, can't you be my boyfriend?

852
01:00:19,500 --> 01:00:21,100
There is no boy like me

853
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:23,133
So suitable to be Prince Charming

854
01:00:23,133 --> 01:00:24,767
I'm Yuri's boyfriend
