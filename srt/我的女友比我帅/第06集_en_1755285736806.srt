188
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,500
Hey Kim Ji-eun

189
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,267
Hey, have you seen this?

190
00:12:55,967 --> 00:12:57,900
Yanxi University Xiaolu Man

191
00:12:57,900 --> 00:13:01,600
(Who is the Xiaolu Man at Yanxi University?)
Many people say they have seen him, but his true face

192
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:03,333
There is still no clear whereabouts

193
00:13:03,333 --> 00:13:05,500
According to reliable sources

194
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:09,300
(Who is the Xiaolu Man at Yanxi University?)
This little deer man is from a certain chaebol family

195
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:11,400
Unknown son

196
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,300
According to Xiaolu's male friend A

197
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,033
He is preparing to become an idol

198
00:13:15,033 --> 00:13:18,000
I also heard that he was in charge of the ladies in Jiangnan Cowherd Club.

199
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,067
Popularity can be said to be extremely red

200
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,533
Please help him cut it like this

201
00:13:23,033 --> 00:13:25,100
Um... please wait a moment

202
00:13:26,167 --> 00:13:28,933
Husband, come here for a moment

203
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:30,067
Um

204
00:13:31,933 --> 00:13:34,567
Isn't this our child?

205
00:13:36,433 --> 00:13:38,567
How could my son...

206
00:13:38,567 --> 00:13:40,267
Auntie, do you know him?

207
00:13:41,167 --> 00:13:43,233
Everyone says he is the deer boy from Yanxi University

208
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,667
He's very handsome, right?

209
00:13:46,433 --> 00:13:47,933
Fawn boy? Fawn boy?

210
00:13:50,067 --> 00:13:52,800
I have seen the deer man with my own eyes.

211
00:13:53,933 --> 00:13:55,633
Really handsome

212
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,867
He's not handsome, but why would he come to our party?

213
00:13:57,867 --> 00:14:00,700
It should be someone I know, right?

214
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,533
Wasn't he the one who carried Park Yun-jae out?

215
00:14:02,533 --> 00:14:04,667
Carry him out? What happened to Park Yun-jae?

216
00:14:04,667 --> 00:14:06,800
He must not remember

217
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:10,000
He didn't even know how much he weighed. He was completely drunk that day.

218
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:12,633
The day after drinking is the worst

219
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,667
Yun Jae

220
00:14:21,267 --> 00:14:24,533
Why do you look so serious and frown?

221
00:14:24,533 --> 00:14:25,567
nothing

222
00:14:28,433 --> 00:14:31,400
Everyone is talking about Kim Ji-hoon

223
00:14:32,233 --> 00:14:34,233
It would be difficult for you to go in now.

224
00:14:34,233 --> 00:14:36,033
I heard he is the youngest son of a chaebol family.

225
00:14:36,033 --> 00:14:37,900
No, it's an idol.

226
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,200
I really don't understand what's there to discuss.

227
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:42,867
That's right

228
00:14:42,867 --> 00:14:45,333
I'm not curious about anyone except Yun Jae

229
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:51,233
I'd better go to the library.

230
00:14:51,667 --> 00:14:52,667
Really

231
00:14:53,433 --> 00:14:54,500
Park Yun-jae

232
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:04,367
Oh my god, isn't he the deer boy?

233
00:15:05,267 --> 00:15:06,400
Shoot quickly

234
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,233
Really handsome

235
00:15:24,033 --> 00:15:25,033
Hello

236
00:15:25,033 --> 00:15:26,567
Is this Mr. Kim Ji-hoon?

237
00:15:27,633 --> 00:15:28,333
Please tell me which

238
00:15:28,333 --> 00:15:30,833
Hello, I am the YouTuber Popularity President

239
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:34,067
Someone told me that you are the deer boy from Yanxi University...

240
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:35,767
I'm not a deer man

241
00:15:36,333 --> 00:15:38,367
But who told you that?

242
00:15:38,367 --> 00:15:40,433
Do you know the online novel writer Mina?

243
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:44,333
Although I'm not very willing

244
00:15:44,333 --> 00:15:46,400
But there's no safer place than here

245
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:48,067
That's why I asked you to come here.

246
00:15:48,067 --> 00:15:50,367
Because it was so sudden, I only bought toilet paper

247
00:15:50,367 --> 00:15:52,033
Thank you. Please sit down first.

248
00:15:57,633 --> 00:16:00,267
Hey, what's up with that Mina sister?

249
00:16:00,267 --> 00:16:01,867
Who the hell does she think she is to leak my phone number?

250
00:16:01,867 --> 00:16:04,000
She is born to be a badass who wants to be famous

251
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:06,033
We embarrassed her that day

252
00:16:06,767 --> 00:16:09,367
So now I should be furious and ready for revenge.

253
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,367
When were these photos taken of you?

254

255
00:16:16,300 --> 00:16:17,767
This was even taken today.

256
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:20,133
What should I do?

257
00:16:27,533 --> 00:16:28,733
You two...

258
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:31,833
Are you serious about each other?

259
00:16:31,833 --> 00:16:34,433
Of course... Yeah

260
00:16:34,433 --> 00:16:35,867
Park Yun-jae, where are you?

261
00:16:35,867 --> 00:16:37,900
What... um

262
00:16:37,900 --> 00:16:41,467
Do you love each other enough to ignore the world's opinions?

263
00:16:41,467 --> 00:16:43,300
Answer this question one, two, three at the same time

264
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:43,933
Right

265
00:16:43,933 --> 00:16:45,600
Okay, that's no problem.

266
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,367
I will take care of the trouble I caused.

You are such a famous writer.

295
00:18:31,733 --> 00:18:33,800
Thank you for finally finding out

296
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:36,700

This is the biggest advantage of our cafe

312

Come here occasionally to read.

313

But why are you here, Mr. Yingshuo?

Because when I think about it carefully, it seems like it's you who comes to me every time.

317
00:19:53,533 --> 00:19:55,867
That's because I don't have to work.

318

370
00:22:28,433 --> 00:22:29,933
Really

371
00:22:29,933 --> 00:22:32,033
I knew it was like this

372
00:22:32,033 --> 00:22:33,900
Listen carefully

373
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:37,267
We don't need insurance

374
00:22:37,267 --> 00:22:38,367
What

375
00:22:38,367 --> 00:22:40,333
Dad, you're so rude.

376
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:43,100
This world is really hopeless.

377
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:48,833
Are you trying to make money from this dying old man?

378
00:22:48,833 --> 00:22:51,500
Even if life is hard, it shouldn't be like this

379
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,933
Stinky girl

380
00:22:52,933 --> 00:22:54,767
What a stinky girl

381
00:22:54,767 --> 00:22:56,533
She's my baby.

382
00:23:09,767 --> 00:23:11,467
You just marry in.

383
00:23:11,467 --> 00:23:13,800
No dowry is needed

384
00:23:14,767 --> 00:23:17,467
My son has been preparing for the exam for a long time

385
00:23:17,467 --> 00:23:20,100
I look a bit sloppy so people often misunderstand me.

386
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:23,233
But we only eat Korean beef and not regular beef.

387
00:23:23,233 --> 00:23:24,100
That's right

388
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,567
Oh my god, I love beef.

389
00:23:33,133 --> 00:23:36,833
Let's set a date first.

390
00:23:37,733 --> 00:23:42,067
Dad, how could we get engaged the first time we met?

391
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:53,667
This guy is totally in love.

392
00:23:54,967 --> 00:23:59,900
He actually thought we were getting married on the day we had beef.

393
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,500
My son is fine

394
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,133
Performed well

395
00:24:06,133 --> 00:24:08,067
I am very satisfied

396
00:24:12,867 --> 00:24:14,600
Since it's like this

397
00:24:16,167 --> 00:24:18,333
Why don't we set a wedding date first?

398
00:24:18,333 --> 00:24:19,767
dad

399
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:23,833
I have no problem booking it first

400
00:24:24,933 --> 00:24:26,900
Yeah

401
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:30,067
Very good

402
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,867
OK

403
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:34,100
uncle

404
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,433
Now I have no regrets in death

405
00:24:36,433 --> 00:24:39,833
Very good

406
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:42,333
Dad, did you see it?

407
00:24:42,333 --> 00:24:46,167
Your grandson is getting married.

408
00:24:46,167 --> 00:24:47,700
Very good

409
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:49,667
Dad, why are you like this suddenly?

410
00:24:51,667 --> 00:24:53,733
Why buy such expensive things?

411
00:24:53,733 --> 00:24:56,100
How do you, a student, get the money?

412
00:24:57,067 --> 00:24:58,700
This is not expensive.

413
00:24:58,700 --> 00:25:01,833
I bought it at a famous bakery in Yanxi University and it was delicious.

414
00:25:01,833 --> 00:25:03,100
Obviously, he is also a son

415
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,933
Why is there such a big difference?

416
00:25:06,333 --> 00:25:08,467
Mom, aren't you going out?

417
00:25:10,767 --> 00:25:14,300
I wish you were my son-in-law

418
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:17,700
My dream is to be a mother-in-law who loves her son-in-law

419
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:20,433
Mom, why don't you go out? I still have to study.

420
00:25:20,433 --> 00:25:22,967
Okay, I'm going out.

421
00:25:23,767 --> 00:25:25,867
That's hard work.

422
00:25:27,633 --> 00:25:28,800
Go out

423
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,100
Oh no

424
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:36,100
Why lock the door?

425
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,533
This one?

426
00:25:45,400 --> 00:25:48,000
Are you also tracking Yuri?

427
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:49,400
That's right

428
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:53,067
Your dream is to become an online novel writer, right?

429
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:55,633
Don't try to get away with it

430
00:25:55,633 --> 00:25:57,133
I helped the teacher...

431
00:25:57,133 --> 00:26:02,433
No, it won't take long for me to cheer up your love.

432
00:26:02,433 --> 00:26:04,467
You actually cheated

433
00:26:06,767 --> 00:26:08,867
Yuna is not like that

434
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:11,033
My favorite writer

435
00:26:11,033 --> 00:26:14,533
Rather than sympathizing with Park Yun-jae

436
00:26:14,533 --> 00:26:17,233
I have been supporting her since her debut.

437
00:26:17,233 --> 00:26:19,867
I am more pitiful because I lost my idol.

438
00:26:19,867 --> 00:26:22,067
It's like I'm being denied

439
00:26:22,067 --> 00:26:23,833
Teacher, do you understand?

440
00:26:27,467 --> 00:26:29,100
Wait a moment

441
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:32,467
So to sum up

442
00:26:32,467 --> 00:26:36,033
The teacher and my brother are really in love

443
00:26:36,033 --> 00:26:38,600
Your Best Friend is a Glass Slipper Writer

444
00:26:38,600 --> 00:26:41,933
Is she covering for you like I am?

445
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,300
is that so

446
00:26:43,967 --> 00:26:45,933
Excuse me

447
00:26:45,933 --> 00:26:47,933
Could you please keep your voice down?

448
00:26:51,833 --> 00:26:54,967
Speak softly

449
00:26:54,967 --> 00:26:56,300
(The never-before-seen Glass Slipper writer makes his first public appearance!)

454
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:13,667
May I have your name

455
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:15,300
My name is Yezhen Yezhen

456
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,600
Can I shake your hand?

457
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:25,000
I am your fan

458
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:30,500
Yuri 4?

459
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:32,467
Are you my fan too?

460
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:35,133
Oh my god, are you the glass slipper?

461
00:27:38,133 --> 00:27:39,267
I thought you were this person

462
00:27:39,267 --> 00:27:43,867
It has nothing to do with the worldview of my pure love comics

463
00:27:43,867 --> 00:27:45,733
I love pure love comics

464
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:48,500
I've seen all your works.

465
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,267
Too exaggerated

466
00:27:50,267 --> 00:27:52,900
You are the glass slipper

467
00:27:53,833 --> 00:27:55,933
There are people waiting behind

468
00:27:55,933 --> 00:27:57,333
Can you please move aside first?

469
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:07,000
Hello

470
00:28:08,333 --> 00:28:09,200
May I have your name

471
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,933
My code name is Sea Sausage

472
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:17,567
You are not Jin Zhi...

473
00:28:17,567 --> 00:28:18,933
That's right

474
00:28:18,933 --> 00:28:21,933
I am Mr. Zhixun's tutoring student

475
00:28:23,367 --> 00:28:26,667
I heard that you and the teacher are close friends.

476
00:28:26,667 --> 00:28:28,733
right

477
00:28:28,733 --> 00:28:31,133
I thought he was a different person and scared me

478
00:28:32,867 --> 00:28:34,467
Anyway, nice to meet you

479
00:28:34,467 --> 00:28:35,333
Your name

480
00:28:35,333 --> 00:28:36,833
My name is Park Yun-a

481
00:28:36,833 --> 00:28:38,900
Yun'e, please draw a heart for me

482
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:39,933
good

(To. Park Yun-a)

484
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,933
This venue is so big

485
00:28:43,933 --> 00:28:45,933
Is Choi Yu-ri so popular?

486
00:28:46,733 --> 00:28:48,400
That's right

487
00:28:50,167 --> 00:28:51,467
Yuri is there

488
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:54,233
Really?

489
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,200
It's amazing. Is the queue here?

490
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,767
It seems

491
00:29:04,200 --> 00:29:06,700
Actually, you don't have to come with me.

492
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:10,133
This is the finale of Yanxi University Xiaolu Man

493
00:29:10,133 --> 00:29:12,367
I am the protector of the deer man.

494
00:29:20,333 --> 00:29:21,533
etc.

495
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,733
That's my sister, right?

496
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:31,133
Really? She should be in school now.

497
00:29:31,133 --> 00:29:32,467
Yun'e

498
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:35,300
It will be troublesome if you mess with her.

499
00:29:35,300 --> 00:29:37,300
Let's just quietly get the autograph and leave.

500
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,700
Isn't that Min Hyuk?

501
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,733
Hey Park Yun-a

502
00:29:50,767 --> 00:29:52,400
Hello

503
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,233
Brother Yunzai

504
00:29:55,233 --> 00:29:56,900
What are you doing here?

505
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,667
What else can I do? Taking pictures, of course.

506
00:29:58,667 --> 00:30:00,767
Why is he taking the photo for you?

507
00:30:00,767 --> 00:30:03,500
Because she asked me to help take the photo

508
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:06,733
Do you know each other?

509
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:10,767
She is my sister

510
00:30:10,767 --> 00:30:13,067
Really

511
00:30:13,067 --> 00:30:15,900
It seems that they really look exactly the same

512
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,600
What did you say?

513
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,533
Damn it, so annoying.

514
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:21,500
What's so annoying? Of course it's annoying.

515
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:22,633
Hello

516
00:30:22,633 --> 00:30:24,233
Teacher Zhixun

517
00:30:24,233 --> 00:30:26,433
It's school time now, right?

518
00:30:26,433 --> 00:30:28,067
I'm just taking a lunch break.

519
00:30:28,067 --> 00:30:30,367
Get back to school while I'm in a good mood

520
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:32,133
Otherwise I'm going to video call my mom.

521
00:30:32,133 --> 00:30:33,800
The old-fashioned is so annoying

522
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:37,733
See you next time, teacher

523
00:30:37,733 --> 00:30:39,100
Goodbye

524
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:40,733
I'm so annoyed. Why did we meet here?

525
00:30:40,733 --> 00:30:42,467
Why don't you go back to school soon?

526
00:30:42,467 --> 00:30:45,067
hateful

527
00:30:45,067 --> 00:30:47,100
Look at her rude look.

528
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,167
Hello, teacher

529
00:30:48,167 --> 00:30:52,100
Hello writers,

530
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,567
Oh my god

531
00:30:53,567 --> 00:30:55,467
Thank you, your work is beautiful.

532
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:58,800
So beautiful. Thank you.

533
00:30:58,800 --> 00:31:00,633
I like your work very much

534
00:31:03,367 --> 00:31:04,633
Oh my god

535
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:07,567
Who is this?

536
00:31:07,567 --> 00:31:10,533
Isn't this the boyfriend of the writer of Glass Slipper?

537
00:31:12,633 --> 00:31:15,200
It's that little deer guy on IG, right?

538
00:31:16,367 --> 00:31:17,967
Hello

539
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:20,300
I've always thought you were very handsome.

540
00:31:20,300 --> 00:31:22,533
So you are the deer man

541
00:31:22,533 --> 00:31:24,600
Oh my god, there is such a thing

542
00:31:25,433 --> 00:31:26,600
who is she

543
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,700
That...Mina sister

544
00:31:29,667 --> 00:31:31,267
Sister Mina

545
00:31:33,467 --> 00:31:34,833
Why are you standing here?

546
00:31:34,833 --> 00:31:37,367
I plan to queue up

547
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:39,100
Why should my boyfriend queue?

548
00:31:39,100 --> 00:31:40,500
Of course I have to take the fast lane.

549
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,933
come over

550
00:31:41,933 --> 00:31:43,000
It's okay with me

551
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:45,167
Come on, I'm really fine.

552
00:31:45,167 --> 00:31:47,000
You all know who he is, right?

553
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,233
The boyfriend of the author of Glass Slippers

554
00:31:49,833 --> 00:31:51,833
Boyfriend Xiaolu Man

555
00:31:51,833 --> 00:31:53,633
Lend me a moment, little deer boy

556
00:31:54,033 --> 00:31:55,333
This won't do.

557
00:31:57,433 --> 00:31:58,767
The boyfriend of the author of Glass Slippers

558
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:00,500
My boyfriend, please lend it to me.

559
00:32:00,500 --> 00:32:01,933
Lend me a moment

560
00:32:01,933 --> 00:32:03,300
Yulilai

561
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:06,600
I don't want to, oh, your boyfriend is here.

562
00:32:08,733 --> 00:32:10,167
Really

563
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:13,200
Lend me a moment...

564
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:16,500
Really

565
00:32:17,767 --> 00:32:19,133
I am your fan

566
00:32:20,467 --> 00:32:23,033
That's too unfamiliar.

567
00:32:23,033 --> 00:32:25,800
Didn't you talk so much last time?

568
00:32:26,767 --> 00:32:29,600
He is Yuri's boyfriend.

569
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:32,933
People who know Xiaolu Man

570
00:32:32,933 --> 00:32:34,533
I

571
00:32:34,967 --> 00:32:36,267
Right

572
00:32:37,667 --> 00:32:39,533
Hey, think of a solution.

573
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:44,867
My dear, you are here

574
00:32:51,667 --> 00:32:53,033
Um

575
00:32:53,033 --> 00:32:54,433
Honey

576
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:56,300
So sweet

577
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,200
How does the private life of each goddess end?

578
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:06,033
Kiss...

579
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,800
Yeah, give me a kiss.

580
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:13,133
The writer's fans have been asking so much

581
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:19,033
Kiss...

582
00:33:19,033 --> 00:33:21,867
Come on... give me a kiss...

583
00:33:21,867 --> 00:33:23,933
A kiss is right

584
00:33:23,933 --> 00:33:25,433
Kiss...

585
00:33:25,433 --> 00:33:27,567
What is happening?

586
00:33:28,767 --> 00:33:29,967
Kiss...

587
00:33:29,967 --> 00:33:33,367
Give me a quick kiss...

588
00:33:33,367 --> 00:33:35,100
hurry upâ€¦

589
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:37,200
Kiss...

590
00:33:37,200 --> 00:33:38,633
Kiss

591
00:33:39,967 --> 00:33:43,200
Are you crazy? The novel can only end when it ends.

592
00:33:43,200 --> 00:33:44,767
What are you talking about?

593
00:33:44,767 --> 00:33:46,167
I'm at a disadvantage, okay?

594
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:47,600
You know I'm single, right?

595
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:48,767
This is my first kiss

596
00:33:48,767 --> 00:33:51,033
So why kiss?

597
00:33:51,033 --> 00:33:52,633
Don't you see what's happening now?

598
00:33:52,633 --> 00:33:56,133
Power lies in actions, not words

599
00:33:56,133 --> 00:33:57,400
Just three seconds

600
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,733
Hello

601
00:34:01,233 --> 00:34:06,867
Kiss...

602
00:34:33,033 --> 00:34:35,467
Hey, smile

603
00:34:35,467 --> 00:34:37,000
We love each other very much

604
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,133
They kissed yeah

605
00:34:50,133 --> 00:34:51,833
This looks like a deer boy.

606
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:52,933
Yes

607
00:34:52,933 --> 00:34:54,500
They are dating

608
00:34:58,767 --> 00:35:00,100
What are you doing?

609
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,567
Is that so?

610
00:35:06,267 --> 00:35:11,667
(Exam Udon)

611
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:20,600
Welcome

612
00:35:20,600 --> 00:35:22,000
Please sit over there.

613
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:32,567
Auntie please give me a night exam udon

614
00:35:33,867 --> 00:35:36,100
You don't look like a candidate

615
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,867
Is this your first time visiting our store?

616
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:39,333
yes

617
00:35:39,333 --> 00:35:41,867
My friends who are studying in Noryangjin

618
00:35:41,867 --> 00:35:44,033
They say the udon here is the best in Noryangjin.

619
00:35:44,033 --> 00:35:45,600
Yeah

620
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:48,333
I don't know who your friend is, but he will definitely be a big shot in the future.

621
00:35:49,567 --> 00:35:52,633
But our restaurant is not so much delicious as it is high value for money.

622
00:35:52,633 --> 00:35:53,967
A lot

623
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:57,500
I don't know your friend's name.

624
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,267
His name is Hong Young-seok

625
00:35:59,267 --> 00:36:00,367
Hong Young-suk

626
00:36:00,367 --> 00:36:01,433
Yingshuo?

627
00:36:01,433 --> 00:36:02,767
Hong Young-suk?

628
00:36:02,767 --> 00:36:04,667
Of course I know him.

629
00:36:04,667 --> 00:36:06,967
It turns out to be Yingshuo's friend

630
00:36:06,967 --> 00:36:11,233
He comes here to eat udon these days.

631
00:36:11,233 --> 00:36:13,733
He is always like a udon noodle eater.

632
00:36:20,667 --> 00:36:24,167
Auntie, are you free to have a soda with me?

633
00:36:30,700 --> 00:36:33,500
Let's set a date first.

634
00:36:33,500 --> 00:36:36,400
I have no problem booking it first

635
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,867
Damn, no cigarettes.

636
00:37:34,967 --> 00:37:36,033
Hello

637
00:37:37,567 --> 00:37:38,933
Hello...

638
00:37:38,933 --> 00:37:41,867
It's a surprise to meet you here.

639
00:37:41,867 --> 00:37:42,967
Um

640
00:37:42,967 --> 00:37:44,200
How come you are here?

641
00:37:50,700 --> 00:37:52,900
The aunt who worked at the exam udon told me this.

642
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:54,900
Say you might be here

643
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:56,567
Auntie

644
00:37:56,567 --> 00:37:57,733
yes

645
00:37:57,733 --> 00:37:59,467
I occasionally come to this second-hand bookstore

646
00:37:59,467 --> 00:38:00,800
Because it's quiet

647
00:38:01,967 --> 00:38:04,900
But how do you know my aunt?

648
00:38:04,900 --> 00:38:07,300
That store is very famous on the exam students' forum.

649
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,167
It is said that the president of Noryangjin

650
00:38:10,033 --> 00:38:11,233
That's right

651
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:13,933
Are you also preparing for the civil service exam?

652
00:38:13,933 --> 00:38:16,133
I didn't join just to find you.

653
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,000
Me?

654
00:38:19,533 --> 00:38:22,667
We didn't exchange contact information when we met last time.

655
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,533
I'm curious about your recent situation.

656
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:29,733
So that's it

657
00:38:36,167 --> 00:38:37,367
Help me press

658
00:38:39,267 --> 00:38:41,267
You won't get married, will you?

659
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:43,933
Or preparing to get married

660
00:38:43,933 --> 00:38:45,367
It doesn't matter if you have children

661
00:38:50,467 --> 00:38:52,867
You're still as clever as ever, Jin Zhihui

662
00:38:58,167 --> 00:38:59,900
This is my phone

663
00:39:04,767 --> 00:39:06,033
With my

664
00:39:12,933 --> 00:39:16,100
When I was in high school, I always laughed with you.

665
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,733
It seemed like they were laughing all the time.

666
00:39:22,533 --> 00:39:24,467
I'm funny now too.

667
00:39:25,733 --> 00:39:26,800
What

668
00:39:27,333 --> 00:39:30,833
I go to a company dinner and everyone gets sick the next day.

669
00:39:30,833 --> 00:39:32,200
Because my stomach hurts from laughing

670
00:39:33,867 --> 00:39:35,500
Is it that exaggerated?

671
00:39:35,500 --> 00:39:37,233
I'll laugh until my stomach hurts

672
00:39:39,067 --> 00:39:40,233
It hurts.

673
00:39:40,233 --> 00:39:41,467
Really

674
00:39:44,267 --> 00:39:46,033
Your hand strength is still very strong

675
00:39:57,400 --> 00:39:58,933
Can I contact you occasionally?

676
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:01,700
Um

677
00:40:02,467 --> 00:40:04,833
But I often can't answer the phone

678
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,200
I'll call you back

679
00:40:12,467 --> 00:40:13,833
That's right

680
00:40:17,733 --> 00:40:20,067
I think you're out of cigarettes.

681
00:40:23,400 --> 00:40:24,700
youâ€¦

682
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,733
What's this

683
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:53,867
Smoking is bad for your health. Just smoke a little.

684
00:40:53,867 --> 00:40:55,167
Supreme Wisdom

685
00:40:58,733 --> 00:41:00,467
This ghost is really...

686
00:41:27,967 --> 00:41:29,133
What are you doing?

687
00:41:34,900 --> 00:41:38,133
Why don't you just do it now with your eyes closed?

688
00:41:39,300 --> 00:41:40,633
No, Choi Yu-ri

689
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:42,333
You're such a bad woman.

690
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,233
How painful is Zhien now?

691
00:41:46,667 --> 00:41:47,700
but

692
00:41:50,900 --> 00:41:52,733
I am in pain too

693
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:27,800
So noisy

694
00:42:28,567 --> 00:42:29,667
Can you let me sit at the same table?

695
00:42:34,233 --> 00:42:35,000
boss

696
00:42:35,867 --> 00:42:36,867
Please give me a Coke

697
00:42:36,867 --> 00:42:37,833
And egg rolls

698
00:42:39,567 --> 00:42:41,600
Oh, and a bowl of rice.

699
00:42:42,767 --> 00:42:44,100
How are you

700
00:42:47,367 --> 00:42:48,967
Don't just drink

701
00:42:48,967 --> 00:42:50,400
Let's eat something first

702
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:52,000
You probably haven't eaten all day.

703
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:58,200
cheers

704
00:43:28,133 --> 00:43:29,133
What's going on?

705
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,200
Hello, what's the situation?

706
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,500
What happened

707
00:43:38,833 --> 00:43:40,767
World War 29 begins

708
00:43:40,767 --> 00:43:43,067
Dad secretly played stocks without letting Mom know

709
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:44,367
There's nothing wrong with playing stocks

710
00:43:44,367 --> 00:43:46,933
Hey, how can you kick Dad out like this?

711
00:43:46,933 --> 00:43:48,767
Lost 30 million yuan

712
00:43:49,733 --> 00:43:51,667
Hey, isn't this Dad's?

713
00:43:52,367 --> 00:43:53,567
It was thrown outside

714
00:43:56,167 --> 00:43:57,100
Really

715
00:44:06,167 --> 00:44:08,033

good

722
00:45:15,633 --> 00:45:16,600
dad

723
00:45:18,467 --> 00:45:19,567
Cheer up

724
00:45:20,433 --> 00:45:24,933
It is common for men to lose money in the stock market.

725
00:45:24,933 --> 00:45:26,700
It's not a loss of 300 million, it's just 30 million

726
00:45:27,867 --> 00:45:28,967
It's 50 million

727
00:45:29,633 --> 00:45:30,733
Fifty million?

728
00:45:32,967 --> 00:45:35,300
You've been receiving a state salary your whole life.

729
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,167
Why play the stock market?

730
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:41,367
Didn't you tell me not to covet money that wasn't earned through hard work?

731
00:45:41,367 --> 00:45:42,933
But you...

732
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,267
what do I do

733
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:05,833
Go away

734
00:46:10,900 --> 00:46:12,067
dad

735
00:46:12,067 --> 00:46:13,833
We're going home

736
00:46:13,833 --> 00:46:15,333
Noâ€¦

737
00:46:15,333 --> 00:46:17,167
At least I have to escape today

738
00:46:19,167 --> 00:46:20,133
Sorry

739
00:46:21,367 --> 00:46:24,333
Let you see your father's miserable appearance

740
00:46:28,467 --> 00:46:29,400
Go away

741
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,133
Welcome

742
00:47:01,900 --> 00:47:04,933
Do you know what life and soju have in common?

743
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:07,400
sister

744
00:47:07,400 --> 00:47:09,333
You only drank less than a bottle of soju, okay?

745
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:13,100
The commonality is...

746
00:47:18,267 --> 00:47:19,633
Both are two words

747
00:47:21,333 --> 00:47:22,633
Should I just drop the package on her?

748
00:47:26,100 --> 00:47:27,600
Me today

749
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,367
Experienced my first kiss

750
00:47:31,500 --> 00:47:33,500
But that kiss wasn't the beginning

751
00:47:34,900 --> 00:47:37,033
But the end

752
00:47:37,033 --> 00:47:39,900
Since we want to help, it is best to help to the end.

753
00:47:39,900 --> 00:47:43,400
And I probably saw it too.

754
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:45,800
The relationship between Yun Jae and Ji Hoon is unusual

755
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:48,700
That was my first kiss

756
00:47:51,867 --> 00:47:53,267
The question is, is it the first time?

757
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:55,800
How important is the first time?

758
00:47:56,233 --> 00:47:58,900
If I had kissed you two or three times, I wouldn't be so troubled.

759
00:48:06,600 --> 00:48:08,433
This is not like

760
00:48:08,433 --> 00:48:09,600
It's the admiration of fans

761
00:48:33,267 --> 00:48:34,167
That madman

762
00:48:35,100 --> 00:48:36,167
Follow me

763
00:48:36,167 --> 00:48:38,300
What? Sister... where are you going?

764
00:48:39,700 --> 00:48:41,500
I'm not mentally prepared yet

765
00:48:42,100 --> 00:48:44,067
He's Park Yoon-jae, right?

766
00:48:47,667 --> 00:48:48,733
Yun Jae

767
00:48:49,833 --> 00:48:52,067
How did he get in there?

768
00:48:52,933 --> 00:48:53,633
Are you going with Zhixun?

769
00:48:53,633 --> 00:48:55,633
He just went to see his mother.

770
00:48:55,633 --> 00:48:56,700
Otherwise

771
00:48:58,133 --> 00:49:01,033
It's all because of you that I stayed up all night last night

772
00:49:01,033 --> 00:49:02,333
What are you doing?

773
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:05,600
You said I was beautiful yesterday

774
00:49:08,067 --> 00:49:09,333
It seems to be with Jiang Minzhou

775
00:49:09,333 --> 00:49:10,300
who

776
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:11,467
Kang Min-joo

777
00:49:11,467 --> 00:49:13,800
She likes Yun Jae

778
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:16,733
Did he go into the motel with her?

779
00:49:16,733 --> 00:49:18,767
No wonder I felt something was wrong.

780
00:49:18,767 --> 00:49:20,533
Something is wrong

781
00:49:20,533 --> 00:49:21,633
Is he cheating?

782
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:23,533
I heard them asking each other if they slept well.

783
00:49:24,500 --> 00:49:26,633
You said I was beautiful last night

784
00:49:26,633 --> 00:49:27,867
Also said this

785
00:49:42,567 --> 00:49:44,267
What the fuck

786
00:49:44,267 --> 00:49:46,367
Can you teach me hairdressing techniques?

787
00:49:48,300 --> 00:49:49,500
What are you going to do after learning this?

788
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:50,900
No

789
00:49:50,900 --> 00:49:53,667
It's hard for me to find a job as a man now.

790
00:49:53,667 --> 00:49:56,567
So I want to learn from you in the store

791
00:49:56,567 --> 00:49:57,533
Yes, wife.

792
00:49:57,533 --> 00:49:59,000
I think it's good.

793
00:49:59,867 --> 00:50:02,867
Do you think anyone can be a hairdresser?

794
00:50:02,867 --> 00:50:04,533
Your hands are not good

795
00:50:05,367 --> 00:50:07,400
That's why I want you to teach me.

796
00:50:20,733 --> 00:50:21,967
Hey, what's wrong, Yuri?

797
00:50:23,533 --> 00:50:25,433
Me? I'm in my mom's shop.

798
00:50:27,300 --> 00:50:29,133
Yun Jae? I just spoke to him on the phone.

799
00:50:29,133 --> 00:50:30,267
What's wrong

800
00:50:31,100 --> 00:50:32,900
Did you say motel?

801
00:50:34,267 --> 00:50:35,467
Who did you say he went to the motel with?

802
00:50:50,933 --> 00:50:51,933
Where is he

803
00:50:51,933 --> 00:50:53,467
Where is Park Yoon-jae?

804
00:50:54,833 --> 00:50:56,267
Did he really go in with Kang Min Joo?

805
00:50:56,267 --> 00:50:57,400
real

806
00:50:58,700 --> 00:51:00,333
Hi, brother

807
00:51:00,333 --> 00:51:02,100
I'm sorry to see you in this situation.

808
00:51:03,067 --> 00:51:05,367
How could Park Yun-jae do this to me?

809
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:07,533
You call him now

810
00:51:09,600 --> 00:51:10,633
Yun Jae is out

811
00:51:18,567 --> 00:51:20,433
He was wearing a coat today.

812
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,367
Not anymore

813
00:51:25,000 --> 00:51:27,500
Terrible

814
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:28,733
I can't stand this.

815
00:51:29,567 --> 00:51:30,967
Hello Park Yun-jae

816
00:51:32,867 --> 00:51:33,833
Hi

817
00:51:34,467 --> 00:51:35,200
Why are you here?

818
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,967
What "Hi"?

819
00:51:36,967 --> 00:51:39,367
You were caught red-handed and you're still so calm

820
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:43,300
Hey, Jin Zhien, come out.

821
00:51:48,467 --> 00:51:49,767
Hello

822
00:51:49,767 --> 00:51:51,467
What's going on with you guys?

823
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,133
Zhixun, why are you here?

824
00:51:54,133 --> 00:51:55,800
We saw it all

825
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:57,733
Saw you in and out of the motel

826
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:01,667
I calculated the time and you were in there for 1 hour, 7 minutes and 34 seconds.

827
00:52:04,067 --> 00:52:05,733
You calculated the time.

828
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:08,633
Did you go with Min-joo?

829
00:52:10,133 --> 00:52:12,233
Did you go there with Kang Min-joo?

830
00:52:12,933 --> 00:52:14,467
What nonsense are you talking about?

831
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:17,733
I went with my dad

832
00:52:18,867 --> 00:52:19,867
Your dad?

833
00:52:19,867 --> 00:52:23,667
It would sound better if you said you were with your mother.

834
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:30,500
Although this situation can easily lead you to misunderstand

835
00:52:30,500 --> 00:52:33,467
But I really went with my dad.

836
00:52:34,133 --> 00:52:35,533
You take the lead

837
00:52:35,533 --> 00:52:37,300
For what

838
00:52:37,300 --> 00:52:38,500
If you're so confident

839
00:52:38,500 --> 00:52:39,600
Just take us in to have a look.

840
00:52:39,600 --> 00:52:41,067
Well said

841
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:43,700
Is it really okay?

842
00:52:43,700 --> 00:52:46,233
There's nothing to lose anyway.

843
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:49,000
Aren't you going to come to my house as a tutor?

844
00:52:51,467 --> 00:52:54,200
Is tutoring still important now?

845
00:52:54,200 --> 00:52:55,967
You are very funny today

846
00:52:56,767 --> 00:52:57,767
Let's go

847
00:52:57,767 --> 00:52:59,500
Hey, keep up.

848
00:53:09,933 --> 00:53:10,833
sister

849
00:53:10,833 --> 00:53:12,967
Would it be too much to ask us to go with you?

850
00:53:12,967 --> 00:53:14,667
Park Yun-jae is the one who went too far

851
00:53:14,667 --> 00:53:16,133
Hurry up and catch up

852
00:53:22,367 --> 00:53:24,067
Watch it

853
00:53:26,933 --> 00:53:28,300
dad

854
00:53:32,167 --> 00:53:33,533
dad

855
00:53:40,500 --> 00:53:42,100
Who is this?

856
00:53:42,100 --> 00:53:43,300
So you are Jiang Minzhou

857
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,433
No

858
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:47,300
what the hell

859
00:53:48,633 --> 00:53:49,733
sorry

860
00:53:49,733 --> 00:53:52,567
I misread the room number.

861
00:53:52,567 --> 00:53:54,200
Really

862
00:53:54,200 --> 00:53:55,467
sorry

863
00:54:00,367 --> 00:54:02,567
No, it's next door.

864
00:54:02,567 --> 00:54:05,133
I really like this. Open the door quickly.

865
00:54:07,467 --> 00:54:09,000
It's really next door.

866
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:11,467
I misread the room number.

867
00:54:11,467 --> 00:54:12,900
Follow me

868
00:54:17,967 --> 00:54:19,333
This time I really look forward to it

869
00:54:22,567 --> 00:54:23,733
dad

870
00:54:26,567 --> 00:54:28,367
dad

871
00:54:28,367 --> 00:54:31,567
I said you left this behind.

872
00:54:35,933 --> 00:54:37,900
Look, this is my dad.

873
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:40,133
My dad

874
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:42,767
It's my dad.

875
00:54:42,767 --> 00:54:43,700
My dad

876
00:54:43,700 --> 00:54:45,967
Look, it's my dad.

877
00:54:45,967 --> 00:54:47,900
Hello, my dad.

878
00:54:47,900 --> 00:54:49,700
It's my dad.

879
00:54:51,667 --> 00:54:54,600
Look, it's not Jiang Minzhou.

880
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:57,400
My dad

881
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:59,000
sorry

882
00:54:59,733 --> 00:55:00,933
sister

883
00:55:00,933 --> 00:55:02,633
Sister, where are you going?

884
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:05,233
Really

885
00:55:08,500 --> 00:55:10,133
Okay, it's okay.

886
00:55:31,833 --> 00:55:33,767
I'm a little sad

887
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,400
Forget about others

888
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:39,533
I didn't expect you to doubt me

889
00:55:40,333 --> 00:55:41,633
sorry

890
00:55:42,300 --> 00:55:45,467
I've always said it's impossible.

891
00:55:45,467 --> 00:55:47,533
But they are so sure

892
00:55:48,867 --> 00:55:51,367
I didn't expect you to distrust me so much

893
00:55:51,367 --> 00:55:54,200
If I hadn't seen you and Kang Min Joo like that...

894
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,100
What did you see me and Jiang Minzhou doing?

895
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:07,600
Actually, I saw

896
00:56:08,633 --> 00:56:11,333
You and Jiang Minzhou looked at each other affectionately in the coffee shop

897
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:12,600
Me?

898
00:56:16,733 --> 00:56:17,833
We really have no relationship.

899
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:19,733
I knew you would say that.

900
00:56:20,600 --> 00:56:23,167
So I'm not going to tell you

901
00:56:26,833 --> 00:56:28,667
sorry

902
00:56:28,667 --> 00:56:31,067
We are really nothing.

903
00:56:31,067 --> 00:56:33,400
Just a simple senior student

904
00:56:34,367 --> 00:56:35,967
I'll keep an eye on you

905
00:56:39,733 --> 00:56:40,967
goodbye

906
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:49,400
But I also have something to say

907
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,300
I saw you kissing Yuri.

908
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:57,033
I feel really bad.

909
00:56:57,033 --> 00:56:59,900
That wasn't a kiss, it was just a touch for a second

910
00:57:00,767 --> 00:57:03,800
Not three seconds?

911
00:57:08,867 --> 00:57:10,633
sorry

912
00:57:10,633 --> 00:57:13,633
I'll draw the line later.

913
00:57:14,367 --> 00:57:16,067
I'll keep an eye on you

914
00:57:17,467 --> 00:57:18,700
You go in

915
00:57:18,700 --> 00:57:22,500
"I see your eyes"

916
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:26,100
"Full of tears"

917
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:29,833
"I will never shed tears again"

918
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:33,433
"believe me now"

919
00:57:33,433 --> 00:57:35,933
"Open your eyes"

920
00:57:46,300 --> 00:57:47,500
What are you doing?

921
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:48,967
Why is Dad here?

922
00:57:48,967 --> 00:57:51,567
Why would she dress like this?

923
00:57:52,367 --> 00:57:56,167
Your mother told me to go home immediately

924
00:57:56,167 --> 00:57:57,300
Did they ask you to dress like this?

925
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,933
She said she would forgive me as long as I was cute

926
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,900
Wrong, not cute at all.

927
00:58:05,633 --> 00:58:08,733
I feel like my mom will file for divorce right away.

928
00:58:46,233 --> 00:58:47,867
Yizuo

929
00:58:52,200 --> 00:58:53,867
Seriouslyâ€¦

930
00:59:20,733 --> 00:59:22,033
Park Yun-jae

931
00:59:22,667 --> 00:59:25,000
Why are you looking for me so early in the morning?

932
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,500
What's with the bow on her head?

933
00:59:43,367 --> 00:59:45,200
How is this?

934
00:59:48,233 --> 00:59:50,033
Do you want to dance together?

935
00:59:50,033 --> 00:59:53,867
Lift your feet like this...

936
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,267
Hand hook and circle

937
01:00:01,233 --> 01:00:02,633
How is this

938
01:00:02,633 --> 01:00:06,133
"What if I mix heart mix heart so my heart"

939
01:00:06,133 --> 01:00:09,100
"I haven't woken up from my dream yet."

940
01:00:09,100 --> 01:00:15,467
"Why am I hanging around you again?"

941
01:00:15,467 --> 01:00:17,233
Come again

942
01:00:17,233 --> 01:00:19,100
One or Two

943
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:24,800
"Can't stop"

944
01:00:24,800 --> 01:00:27,267
"can't stop thinking about you"

945
01:00:31,400 --> 01:00:33,700
What are you two doing here so early in the morning?

946
01:00:34,267 --> 01:00:38,333
Minjoo, why are you here so early in the morning?

947
01:00:38,333 --> 01:00:40,733
Me? I'm moving here.

948
01:00:40,733 --> 01:00:44,000
Moving? Where?

949
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:45,200
here

950
01:00:47,700 --> 01:00:49,900
Is this here?

951
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:51,200
This house?

952
01:00:51,200 --> 01:00:54,233
Opposite Room 202, 2nd Floor

953
01:01:09,633 --> 01:01:12,967
(Thanks to Kang Shin-il, Park Myung-shin, and Ye-won for their special appearances)

954
01:01:41,933 --> 01:01:45,933
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

955
01:01:45,933 --> 01:01:48,633
Yun Jae, help me.

956
01:01:48,633 --> 01:01:51,167
I'm so jealous I'm going crazy

957
01:01:51,167 --> 01:01:53,300
I feel a little hot too.

958
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:55,367
I'd better go home directly.

959
01:01:55,367 --> 01:01:57,267
The cheating guy next door...

960
01:01:59,000 --> 01:02:01,900
Maybe I twisted my ankle because I walked too fast.

961
01:02:01,900 --> 01:02:03,633
I will be worried if you go home alone

962
01:02:03,633 --> 01:02:04,933
Can't read books

963
01:02:04,933 --> 01:02:05,667
Brother Zhixun

964
01:02:05,667 --> 01:02:07,000
She has been pretending to be familiar

965
01:02:07,000 --> 01:02:08,800
But how did she know my number?

966
01:02:08,800 --> 01:02:10,967
Why would you think of looking up?

967
01:02:10,967 --> 01:02:13,867
Do you want to win Park Yoon-jae's heart?
