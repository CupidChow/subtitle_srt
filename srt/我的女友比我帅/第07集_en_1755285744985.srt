00:00:11,233 --> 00:00:13,200
(Yin Chan-ha)

2
00:00:16,867 --> 00:00:18,833
(Arin)

3
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:27,333
(Yoo Jung-ho)

4
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,533
(Chuu)

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,100
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

6
00:00:51,767 --> 00:00:53,267
Park Yun-jae

7
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:55,533
Why are you looking for me so early in the morning?

8
00:00:56,300 --> 00:00:58,167
What's with the bow on her head?

9
00:01:06,933 --> 00:01:08,700
How is this?

10
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,167
Do you want to dance together?

11
00:01:10,167 --> 00:01:15,367
Lift your feet like this...

12
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:19,733
Hand hook and circle

13
00:01:21,867 --> 00:01:23,633
How is this

14
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:26,700
Come again

15
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:30,667
One or Two

16
00:01:38,367 --> 00:01:40,333
What are you two doing here so early in the morning?

17
00:01:41,133 --> 00:01:45,200
Minjoo, why are you here so early in the morning?

18
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:47,500
Me? I'm moving here.

19
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,667
Moving? Where?

20
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,033
here

21
00:01:54,133 --> 00:01:55,400
Is this here?

22
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,400
This house?

23
00:01:57,400 --> 00:02:00,300
Opposite Room 202, 2nd Floor

24
00:02:06,533 --> 00:02:08,067
How do you react like this?

25
00:02:08,067 --> 00:02:10,000
Can't I move here?

26
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,033
Um

27
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,333
But what are you two doing here?

28
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,033
Well...

29
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,267
This is because…

30
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:29,067
I live here too...

31
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:30,533
Like I said when I was loading the cargo

32
00:02:30,533 --> 00:02:32,100
You have more than I thought.

33
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:34,933
I'll help you move your things up there and then I have to leave.

34
00:02:34,933 --> 00:02:36,433
Okay, I understand.

35
00:02:36,433 --> 00:02:37,567
good

36
00:02:45,033 --> 00:02:45,967
Brothers

37
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:48,067
Do you want to come to my house and eat some noodles with soybean paste?

38
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,767
(Episode 7: Sharing the Sleeping with the Enemy)

39
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:25,800
It's okay if you go home directly

40
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,967
I'll just stay and help out.

41
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,800
I hate it even more.

42
00:03:30,433 --> 00:03:31,567
don’t worry

43
00:03:31,567 --> 00:03:34,833
I don't want to waste my energy on her and this house.

44
00:03:36,267 --> 00:03:39,433
Yun Jae and I brought this into the room together.

45
00:03:41,367 --> 00:03:42,467
Um

46
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:46,667
one two three

47
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,467
Thanks

48
00:03:51,367 --> 00:03:52,500
This must be heavy.

49
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,933
No, where should I put it?

50
00:03:55,933 --> 00:03:57,433
Put it over there

51
00:04:10,867 --> 00:04:11,833
Yun Jae

52
00:04:28,533 --> 00:04:29,300
Minjoo what

53
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,567
Where should I put this?

54
00:04:31,567 --> 00:04:33,033
Yun Jae, please help me wipe this.

55
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:34,200
Too high

56
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,500
Yun Jae, help me.

57
00:04:51,133 --> 00:04:53,867
I didn't expect Zhixun to be so serious about his work.

58
00:05:06,867 --> 00:05:08,500
What am I doing?

59
00:05:09,267 --> 00:05:11,900
Blinded by jealousy, I'm asking for trouble

60
00:05:12,967 --> 00:05:14,300
I'd better go home directly.

61
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,667
Yun Jae, help me.

62
00:05:16,667 --> 00:05:20,200
Yoon Jae hyung...

63
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,767
Is it necessary to read the manual for this trivial matter?

64
00:05:27,767 --> 00:05:29,000
Leave it to me

65
00:05:42,733 --> 00:05:43,800
alright

66
00:05:47,267 --> 00:05:48,867
This thing...

67
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,433
What was it originally?

68
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:52,667
Chair

69
00:05:54,367 --> 00:05:55,600
Is it a chair?

70
00:05:59,733 --> 00:06:01,167
Almost there

71
00:06:01,167 --> 00:06:02,733
This is over, right?

72
00:06:03,533 --> 00:06:05,067
Perfect

73
00:06:05,067 --> 00:06:06,033
alright

74
00:06:06,033 --> 00:06:07,533
OK

75
00:06:07,533 --> 00:06:08,967
Finish

76
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:12,233
Very sturdy

77
00:06:12,233 --> 00:06:13,700
marvelous

78
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:16,967
I'll kill you

79
00:06:21,167 --> 00:06:23,400
Yun Jae, why are you sweating so much?

80
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,600
What

81
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:27,900
I'm a little hot

82
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,633
What should I do? It's too hard to help me.

83
00:06:31,767 --> 00:06:33,333
It doesn't matter

84
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,633
Wait a minute

85
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,133
Drink some water

86
00:06:42,133 --> 00:06:43,600
Thanks

87
00:06:55,267 --> 00:06:58,200
But I also feel a little hot

88
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,733
Zhixun, aren't you hot?

89
00:07:52,533 --> 00:07:53,633
The noodles are here

90
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:54,900
I'll get it

91
00:08:06,567 --> 00:08:09,333
I asked for cutlery but they didn't give it to me

92
00:08:09,333 --> 00:08:10,833
Don't you have chopsticks at home?

93
00:08:10,833 --> 00:08:12,867
Well, I use disposable chopsticks.

94
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,333
How dare you say this?

95
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,333
What

96
00:08:16,333 --> 00:08:18,033
fine

97
00:08:18,033 --> 00:08:19,733
I'll go home and get it

98
00:08:19,733 --> 00:08:22,433
Where is your home? How do you say you want to go home to get it?

99
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,900
Didn't I just say that?

100
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,467
I live in this community

101
00:08:27,467 --> 00:08:30,700
Really? Where do you live?

102
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,800
But the noodles will clump together, so it’s faster to buy them at a nearby convenience store.

103
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,933
It's faster to go to Zhixun's house

104
00:08:35,933 --> 00:08:38,833
He lives so close, where is he?

105
00:08:38,833 --> 00:08:39,867
No. 201

106
00:08:39,867 --> 00:08:41,300
No. 201?

107
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:43,167
Where is No. 201?

108
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:47,667
My house next door?

109
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,000
Oh my god

110
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:01,367
That was my first kiss

111
00:09:01,367 --> 00:09:03,367
The question is, is it the first time?

112
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,267
What's going on?

113
00:09:05,267 --> 00:09:08,167
How important is the first time?

114
00:09:08,167 --> 00:09:09,900
This is not like

115
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,567
It's the admiration of fans

116
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,600
What the hell is this?

117
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,000
What memory is this

118
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,500
That's ridiculous.

119
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:27,567
Me...Me and Lee Min Hyuk?

120
00:09:34,533 --> 00:09:38,633
"Her kisses were like raindrops falling on rocks"

121
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,467
Do you know what life and soju have in common?

122
00:09:45,467 --> 00:09:47,000
What?

123
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,467
The commonality is...

124
00:09:52,467 --> 00:09:54,233
Both are two words

125
00:09:56,567 --> 00:09:58,533
Is her novel written by AI?

126
00:09:59,933 --> 00:10:02,033
I've been fooled once, how could I be fooled a second time?

127
00:10:02,033 --> 00:10:05,567
You're telling lies all the time.

128
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:08,400
Don't worry about how I live from now on.

129
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,267
We end here

130
00:10:12,667 --> 00:10:14,533
Did you have another fight with your gym trainer?

131
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,433
Why this time?

132
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:19,633
He said the stepper was easy, but I almost died of exhaustion.

133
00:10:19,633 --> 00:10:20,267
What is this?

134
00:10:20,267 --> 00:10:22,600
I just received your express delivery.

135
00:10:26,733 --> 00:10:28,867
The old woman is here again

136
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:35,000
His eyes are so big

137
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:36,933
So cute

138
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,633
I'm so tired. If there are guests coming

139
00:10:47,633 --> 00:10:49,867
Don't say I'm the boss, say I'm a tough customer.

140
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,100
Although no one will come

141
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,367
But even if you really come, you won’t feel like the boss

142
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,133
Excuse me

143
00:11:05,367 --> 00:11:06,500
Hello

144
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,833
Can I meet the boss lady, please?

145
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,567
this…

146
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,467
Our boss lady is not in the store

147
00:11:15,467 --> 00:11:18,033
You can tell me and I'll pass it on.

148
00:11:18,033 --> 00:11:19,200
So that's it

149
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,433
Please help me get this to her.

150
00:11:23,767 --> 00:11:24,967
May I ask your name?

151
00:11:24,967 --> 00:11:27,600
If you tell her she's Hong Young-suk's mother, she'll know.

152
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:29,767
Sorry for the trouble

153
00:11:29,767 --> 00:11:31,067
aunt

154
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:35,800
I thought I wouldn't see you anymore

155
00:11:36,533 --> 00:11:38,200
I just went to exercise

156
00:11:39,233 --> 00:11:41,400
Please sit here first.

157
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,600
Thanks

158
00:11:44,333 --> 00:11:45,700
What a great shop!

159
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:48,133
This is my son.

160
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:55,433
Recently, the side shots of dating have all taken this natural route.

161
00:11:59,567 --> 00:12:01,200
Please help me order food

162
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:03,400
Auntie, what kind of tea would you like?

163
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:05,333
The menu is over there

164
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:10,200
I like to drink ice water

165
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,667
Did you hear that? I want the best ice water.

166
00:12:13,667 --> 00:12:15,633
Bring a little of each dessert.

167
00:12:16,667 --> 00:12:19,333
Why didn't I take you to a better place?

168
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:22,233
My son is just stupid, please understand.

169
00:12:23,233 --> 00:12:25,233
That restaurant is very delicious.

170
00:12:26,267 --> 00:12:29,200
By the way, why are you here?

171
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,867
I forgot all about it

172
00:12:30,867 --> 00:12:33,800
I brought some wujiapi wine.

173
00:12:35,167 --> 00:12:37,833
I brewed this myself.

174
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh my god, this is so precious.

175
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,733
There's nothing I can do as an old country boy.

176
00:12:46,367 --> 00:12:49,067
Last time I asked my son what he likes to eat

177
00:12:49,067 --> 00:12:50,900
He said you like drinking.

178
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:54,267
Oh my god, he really doesn't hide it.

179
00:12:54,267 --> 00:12:57,133
Being fair and honest is suitable for being a civil servant.

180
00:12:57,133 --> 00:13:00,033
The alcohol sold in supermarkets is all chemical alcohol

181
00:13:00,033 --> 00:13:02,000
This is real medicinal wine.

182
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,600
Tell me after you finish drinking

183
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:09,067
Mulberry wine, plum wine, ginseng wine, wild ginseng wine

184
00:13:09,067 --> 00:13:11,100
Just ask me and I can brew it for you

185
00:13:15,433 --> 00:13:18,333
Thank you, auntie

186
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,167
I'm more grateful to you

187
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,000
Thanks for your hard work

188
00:13:37,300 --> 00:13:39,433
I'm so tired, Yunzai brother, help me with this

189
00:13:39,433 --> 00:13:41,100
Take a break

190
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,300
Hang here

191
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,267
hurry up

192
00:13:51,233 --> 00:13:52,967
(When You're Young)
Thank you

193
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:59,300
Very good

194
00:13:59,733 --> 00:14:01,467
How come this is here?

195
00:14:02,833 --> 00:14:05,000
By the way, this book

196
00:14:05,933 --> 00:14:07,167
How come this is here?

197
00:14:07,167 --> 00:14:09,533
I dropped it in the store when I was eating spicy hot pot.

198
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:11,233
Yun Jae, this is yours, right?

199
00:14:11,233 --> 00:14:12,433
What

200
00:14:19,867 --> 00:14:20,967
right

201
00:14:23,933 --> 00:14:26,867
Your girlfriend's photo is much better than her in person

202
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,133
How can it be the same?

203
00:14:31,067 --> 00:14:32,933
I'm not like that.

204
00:14:33,833 --> 00:14:35,567
How am I?

205
00:14:35,567 --> 00:14:37,500
Super ordinary

206
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,300
But the photo looks like a beauty

207
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:40,667
It's just a scam

208
00:14:40,667 --> 00:14:42,433
I've also seen her in person

209
00:14:42,433 --> 00:14:44,167
I am much more beautiful

210
00:14:44,767 --> 00:14:46,633
Are you prettier than her?

211
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,733
You men have really bad eyesight.

212
00:14:50,733 --> 00:14:52,200
Can't stand it

213
00:14:52,200 --> 00:14:53,533
Do you have poor eyesight?

214
00:14:53,533 --> 00:14:54,833
What

215
00:14:54,833 --> 00:14:57,433
I have such good eyesight.

216
00:14:59,867 --> 00:15:01,467
What? It's so childish.

217
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,800
Pack up the rest quickly.

218
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:36,100
Come in

219
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:48,767
I never thought you'd live here.

220
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:52,267
Thank you very much today

221
00:15:52,267 --> 00:15:54,133
We will be good in the future...

222
00:15:58,200 --> 00:15:59,500
Get along

223
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:07,400
Awesome

224
00:16:15,967 --> 00:16:17,200
(When Youth)

225
00:16:37,367 --> 00:16:38,633
What's going on?

226
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,667
Is she imitating me?

227
00:16:45,933 --> 00:16:47,233
No way

228
00:16:57,833 --> 00:16:59,033
How is it possible?

229
00:17:02,267 --> 00:17:05,300
Why do you learn from me?

230
00:17:14,333 --> 00:17:19,233
Do you want to win Park Yoon-jae's heart?

231
00:17:29,533 --> 00:17:30,900
I'm back

232
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:36,100
Dad, what are you doing?

233
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,400
Can't you see? I'm doing housework.

234
00:17:39,067 --> 00:17:40,500
It's so late

235
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,767
I'll sort it out after it's past ten o'clock.

236
00:17:42,767 --> 00:17:44,767
It's more obvious when you do it in a quiet time.

237
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:46,667
Ouch

238
00:17:47,400 --> 00:17:48,900
Really

239
00:17:50,833 --> 00:17:53,033
Although my waist hurts a little

240
00:17:53,033 --> 00:17:56,133
But I finally got the cupboards organized.

241
00:17:56,967 --> 00:17:58,500
I feel so good

242
00:18:01,533 --> 00:18:03,200
Get some sleep first

243
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,967
Let's clean the balcony tomorrow.

244
00:18:07,733 --> 00:18:11,433
Ouch…

245
00:18:19,967 --> 00:18:21,267
Do you want to sleep in the living room?

246
00:18:21,267 --> 00:18:22,967
Please turn off the lights before entering the room.

247
00:18:25,467 --> 00:18:27,100
Are you afraid of Mom?

248
00:18:27,100 --> 00:18:28,133
Go to my room and sleep.

249
00:18:28,133 --> 00:18:30,767
It's not obvious enough if I sleep in your room.

250
00:18:31,433 --> 00:18:34,367
What are you trying to make clear?

251
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:38,233
I got into such a big trouble

252
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:41,733
I need to use my whole body to show that I'm reflecting on myself.

253
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:47,433
How does your mother do these housework every day?

254
00:18:47,433 --> 00:18:50,100
Here I am again. Every time I talk about it, I still stand on my mother's side.

255
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,233
Yeah

256
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:59,900
If you think about it carefully, I am also quite pitiful.

257
00:19:01,833 --> 00:19:02,933
Go to sleep

258
00:19:14,967 --> 00:19:17,367
Do you get along well with your girlfriend?

259
00:19:18,333 --> 00:19:19,700
Girlfriend?

260
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,700
It's not easy

261
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,600
Women are difficult

262
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:39,133
Especially the woman I love deeply is more difficult

263
00:19:39,633 --> 00:19:43,033
But the more this happens, the more you can't escape

264
00:19:43,033 --> 00:19:44,633
You have to face it well

265
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:48,433
Have dinner and watch a movie together

266
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:50,967
Chat about everything

267
00:19:51,867 --> 00:19:53,633
Holding Hands

268
00:19:55,067 --> 00:19:56,567
Kiss

269
00:19:57,767 --> 00:19:59,667
I only teach you some useless things.

270
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,000
No kissing

271
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,367
I'm going to sleep

272
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:11,367
Good night

273
00:20:33,233 --> 00:20:35,867
Can't escape, have to face it

274
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:41,100
I want to too.

275
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:44,133
Face to face with Kim Ji-eun

276
00:20:55,933 --> 00:21:01,000
"The breeze shakes the window"

277
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:05,467
"I Like You" Luo Taizhu

278
00:21:05,467 --> 00:21:08,833
You don't need to know how much I like you

279
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:13,933
My liking for you is purely my personal thing

280
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:18,867
Just thinking of you alone makes my thoughts overflow

281
00:21:18,867 --> 00:21:22,100
Even if you don't exist I still like you

282
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:28,567
Do you still like each other even though they are no longer together?

283
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,367
Park Yun-jae

284
00:21:32,367 --> 00:21:34,633
If I disappeared would you still like me?

285
00:21:39,167 --> 00:21:41,833
I should still like you

286
00:21:43,333 --> 00:21:47,300
"Hold me tight"

287
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,400
"Comfort Me"

288
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,167
"Sleep well."

289
00:21:52,167 --> 00:21:58,267
"Such a comfort"

290
00:21:58,267 --> 00:22:06,067
"Even if it hurts so much that I can't walk"

291
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:10,900
"Even if tears blur my vision"

292
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,800
What gesture can be better than loving?

293
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,767
one two three

294
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,400
Come again

295
00:22:21,167 --> 00:22:22,867
What to do

296
00:22:22,867 --> 00:22:24,500
Is this okay?

297
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:29,100
The last one The last one

298
00:22:32,267 --> 00:22:33,667
Kiss, kiss?

299
00:22:33,667 --> 00:22:38,133
"Like stars full of eyes"

300
00:22:42,967 --> 00:22:48,333
"I won't cry today"

301
00:22:48,333 --> 00:22:53,000
"Even with tears in my eyes"

302
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,267
Great Grace

303
00:22:54,267 --> 00:23:02,433
"I want to smile like the stars in the distance"

304
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:10,167
Those happy memories

305
00:23:10,167 --> 00:23:15,867
"I will treasure them in my heart"

306
00:23:16,700 --> 00:23:26,133
"Shine forever like the star with eyes"

307
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:29,333
If I disappeared would you still like me?

308
00:23:29,333 --> 00:23:31,733
I should still like you

309
00:23:47,800 --> 00:23:48,967
Brother Zhixun

310
00:23:51,367 --> 00:23:53,533
Zhixun gave me a fright

311
00:23:53,533 --> 00:23:54,900
Hi

312
00:23:56,367 --> 00:23:57,767
The hairpin is very beautiful

313
00:23:57,767 --> 00:24:00,300
I'm tired of hearing compliments.

314
00:24:01,167 --> 00:24:04,067
Oh my god, is that a pain patch?

315
00:24:04,067 --> 00:24:06,167
Is it because you helped me move things yesterday?

316
00:24:06,167 --> 00:24:08,400
It's not you, don't worry about it

317
00:24:10,333 --> 00:24:11,933
I felt before

318
00:24:11,933 --> 00:24:14,167
You are the tsundere type.

319
00:24:14,167 --> 00:24:15,733
Right

320
00:24:18,500 --> 00:24:22,433
I never had friends from the same community.

321
00:24:22,433 --> 00:24:24,167
Not to mention living next door

322
00:24:24,167 --> 00:24:25,800
Super cool

323
00:24:26,733 --> 00:24:28,733
Why are you following me?

324
00:24:29,633 --> 00:24:31,267
Birds of a feather flock together?

325
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:32,967
You look a bit like Yun Jae hyung too

326
00:24:32,967 --> 00:24:35,333
You're not listening at all.

327
00:24:41,433 --> 00:24:43,433
but

328
00:24:43,433 --> 00:24:45,133
How similar am I to him?

329
00:24:46,233 --> 00:24:49,033
Simple and cute

330
00:24:49,033 --> 00:24:52,100
But you're still no match for the puppy Park Yun-jae

331
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,600
Woof woof

332
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,200
I miss Park Yoon-jae so much

333
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,900
Park Yun-jae

334
00:25:04,367 --> 00:25:06,100
Throw it here together

335
00:25:09,533 --> 00:25:12,033
(Recruiting part-time students is open to anyone regardless of gender)
What's this

336
00:25:14,733 --> 00:25:16,233
What's going on?

337
00:25:20,633 --> 00:25:22,000
Hello

338
00:25:23,267 --> 00:25:24,467
good

339
00:25:31,367 --> 00:25:32,600
Why is no one coming?

340
00:25:33,833 --> 00:25:35,533
They will come

341
00:25:35,533 --> 00:25:37,667
How to hold a group meeting in a place like this?

342
00:25:37,667 --> 00:25:39,533
Minjoo

343
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,700
How do I look today?

344
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,667
Are you going somewhere nice?

345
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,400
Here

346
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,067
Where is a good place to hold a group meeting?

347
00:25:53,167 --> 00:25:55,133
What happened?

348
00:25:55,133 --> 00:25:56,967
Will anyone really come?

349
00:26:00,633 --> 00:26:01,500
I'm leaving

350
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:02,833
Minjoo, wait a minute.

351
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:04,933
Today is my birthday

352
00:26:07,333 --> 00:26:10,367
Can you have dinner with me?

353
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,167
Welcome

354
00:26:17,933 --> 00:26:20,033
How about this hat?

355
00:26:20,033 --> 00:26:21,900
What do you like?

356
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,033
Yeah, I like it very much

357
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,100
I want to buy this

358
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:28,733
Good total of 10,000 yuan

359
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,633
Thanks

360
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:35,400
for you

361
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:36,833
Is this a birthday present?

362
00:26:36,833 --> 00:26:38,100
Just take it as it is

363
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:40,233
Thank you so much, Minjoo

364
00:26:40,233 --> 00:26:43,433
If it's a boy I like or have a crush on

365
00:26:43,433 --> 00:26:46,133
Even if there is 1% of boys who like me

366
00:26:46,133 --> 00:26:48,267
I won't give gifts like this.

367
00:26:48,267 --> 00:26:51,800
I will choose carefully and think carefully

368
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:55,000
Let that gift represent me

369
00:26:56,033 --> 00:26:58,300
You know what I mean?

370
00:27:00,867 --> 00:27:04,500
Don't create such embarrassing situations in the future.

371
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,500
Happy birthday

372
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:27,800
If you want to wear the crown, you must bear its weight

373
00:27:40,833 --> 00:27:42,267
Sit down

374
00:28:27,533 --> 00:28:30,467
Yes, a little further forward

375
00:28:30,467 --> 00:28:33,167
It hurts... Take it slow.

376
00:28:33,167 --> 00:28:34,400
Just say it hurts

377
00:28:34,400 --> 00:28:37,200
Stop now, it hurts so much

378
00:28:38,767 --> 00:28:40,200
Come to finish the exercise

379
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,933
Relax

380
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:54,367
Why did you ask me to do this so early in the morning?

381
00:28:54,367 --> 00:28:56,600
Mom, when did you start learning yoga?

382
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:58,967
When I become a boy like you

383
00:28:58,967 --> 00:29:01,800
Do you think I don't work hard?

384
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,300
That was my first time to learn meditation and yoga.

385
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:07,500
It will also help you

386
00:29:08,433 --> 00:29:11,133
I haven't done yoga for a long time and my body feels light.

387
00:29:11,133 --> 00:29:13,000
Do you feel light-hearted?

388
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,400
Look at my figure

389
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,367
Can you feel light after doing yoga?

390
00:29:16,367 --> 00:29:18,733
I weigh more than 70 kilograms

391
00:29:18,733 --> 00:29:21,300
Arms are hard as rocks

392
00:29:22,467 --> 00:29:26,167
I weighed over 100 kilograms at that time.

393
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,467
Oh my god

394
00:29:41,167 --> 00:29:45,067
Yoga is most effective when you are upset

395
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:46,867
You should also try to make it a habit

396
00:29:46,867 --> 00:29:48,100
good

397
00:29:48,100 --> 00:29:51,800
Just blame it on me and resent me.

398
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:54,067
Mom feels sorry for you.

399
00:29:54,067 --> 00:29:57,000
But you can't just feel guilty.

400
00:29:58,267 --> 00:30:00,733
Like today, I will try my best to teach and help you

401
00:30:00,733 --> 00:30:03,733
I don't hate you nor do I blame you

402
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:07,500
It is difficult to love someone, but it is easy to hate someone

403
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:09,967
Our lives are extraordinary enough.

404
00:30:09,967 --> 00:30:12,300
Take it easy on yourself. It's okay, mom.

405
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:14,067
Just say I don't hate you anymore

406
00:30:14,067 --> 00:30:16,600
Why do you keep talking like this? It's so annoying.

407
00:30:19,500 --> 00:30:21,867
My dear daughter Zhien

408
00:30:23,167 --> 00:30:24,700
Mom, let's go first.

409
00:30:24,700 --> 00:30:26,833

There is a reason why the works are popular

00:31:34,733 --> 00:31:38,133

Do you know Book Basket Publishing?

421
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:43,367
Of course I know

422
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:46,700
Books published by our publishing house

423
00:31:46,700 --> 00:31:51,233
The one that touched you the most was "The Birth and Death of the Universe".

424
00:31:51,233 --> 00:31:55,067
Recommended by my boyfriend who is studying astronomy

425
00:31:55,067 --> 00:31:58,500
I read the novel The Birth and Death of the Universe

426
00:32:03,500 --> 00:32:05,300
But why do I feel that you look familiar?

427
00:32:07,533 --> 00:32:09,300
Wait, that's you.

428
00:32:10,633 --> 00:32:11,833
Can you recognize me?

429
00:32:11,833 --> 00:32:13,533
Of course I recognize it.

430
00:32:13,533 --> 00:32:15,400
Who are you…

431
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,833
The boyfriend of the author of Glass Slippers

432
00:32:16,833 --> 00:32:18,633
Little deer boy, right?

433
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,700
I am a fan of the author of Glass Slippers

434
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:27,633
I've watched you kissing videos many times.

435
00:32:28,367 --> 00:32:29,367
So that's it

436
00:32:30,167 --> 00:32:32,600
Are you a writer too?

437
00:32:34,033 --> 00:32:35,133
no

438
00:32:36,667 --> 00:32:39,067
It's so obvious that you're lying.

439
00:32:39,067 --> 00:32:44,333
By the way, our company will hold a novel competition next month

440
00:32:44,333 --> 00:32:46,267
(Shulan Publishing House Online Novel Competition)
You also sign up for a try

441
00:32:47,900 --> 00:32:49,533
I'm just interested

442
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:52,567
Usually, interests become expertise and expertise becomes career.

443
00:32:52,567 --> 00:32:56,567
The author of Glass Slippers also won the prize by participating in the competition with a friend.

444
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:58,367
You know, I just started on this road.

445
00:32:59,367 --> 00:33:01,167
That friend is me

446
00:33:02,367 --> 00:33:04,767
Sorry I talked too much on our first meeting.

447
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,133
Then I'll go first

448
00:33:12,033 --> 00:33:13,333
Don't give up

449
00:33:14,400 --> 00:33:16,633
Didn’t a famous director once say

450
00:33:16,633 --> 00:33:20,100
The most personal work is the most creative

451
00:33:20,633 --> 00:33:23,033
Start with your own story

452
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:27,867
good

453
00:33:27,867 --> 00:33:29,433
Thank you, Team Leader

454
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:37,000
etc.

455
00:33:37,000 --> 00:33:39,700
Did I say I'm the team leader?

456
00:33:46,433 --> 00:33:47,733
Hello

457
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:54,767
28,800 yuan is good

458
00:33:54,767 --> 00:33:57,133
Do you need a 100 yuan bag? No

459
00:33:57,133 --> 00:33:58,500
Is there parking?

460
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,867
Who?

461
00:34:04,767 --> 00:34:05,800
Hello

462
00:35:04,000 --> 00:35:05,667
I'm sure there will be a salary.

463
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:19,167
Young Master and Young Lady, Please Hug Me

464
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,833
well done

465
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:45,400
So tsundere

466
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,700
Minjoo

467
00:35:46,700 --> 00:35:48,367
The two really have a couple feeling

468
00:35:48,367 --> 00:35:49,700
Keep it like this

469
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:52,900
The second phase will begin in 30 minutes. Please prepare.

470
00:35:52,900 --> 00:35:57,267
By the way, please be more real with your intimacy.

471
00:35:57,267 --> 00:35:58,433
Many couples will come

472
00:35:58,433 --> 00:35:59,667
well

473
00:36:02,833 --> 00:36:04,600
For a first time, you did pretty well.

474
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,233
Of course it's all thanks to her looks.

475
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,967
But how do you know my phone number?

476
00:36:09,967 --> 00:36:11,067
Lee Min Hyuk

477
00:36:11,067 --> 00:36:12,600
Min Hyuk

478
00:36:14,167 --> 00:36:17,133
But why is he looking for me instead of Yunzai?

479
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:19,133
Capitalism is cruel

480
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,667
The person who was absent from work was a very handsome model

481
00:36:26,067 --> 00:36:27,400
What?

482
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,233
Are you saying Yun Jae isn't handsome?

483
00:36:30,567 --> 00:36:34,333
No matter how much you support your own people, you can't say he is handsome.

484
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:40,633
It is better to say that he is simple and cute than to say that he is handsome

485
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:43,067
Do you think so too?

486
00:36:43,067 --> 00:36:44,833
It seems I'm not the only one who thinks

487
00:36:44,833 --> 00:36:48,100
That's right, Yun Jae is very simple

488
00:36:48,100 --> 00:36:49,367
Super tender

489
00:36:49,367 --> 00:36:50,500
Like tofu

490
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:52,133
Super tender

491
00:36:52,133 --> 00:36:54,767
Is the left cheek tender or the right cheek tender?

492
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:58,000
I really want to take a bite

493
00:36:58,000 --> 00:36:59,033
It feels really tender

494
00:36:59,033 --> 00:37:01,333
If you want to bite tofu, go to jail.

495
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:06,067
But how did you start this job?

496
00:37:06,067 --> 00:37:08,667
It seems this isn't your first time.

497
00:37:08,667 --> 00:37:10,933
Although I don't seem to be short of money

498
00:37:10,933 --> 00:37:12,833
But I've done all kinds of jobs.

499
00:37:13,767 --> 00:37:14,933
Trust me

500
00:37:15,967 --> 00:37:17,400
and

501
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,533
I also want cash

502
00:37:20,600 --> 00:37:21,900
200,000

503
00:37:23,667 --> 00:37:24,667
200,000?

504
00:37:24,667 --> 00:37:26,000
Um

505
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,400
Oh my god

506
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:30,067
Hello, thank you.

507
00:37:30,067 --> 00:37:31,233
Remember to look for me often

508
00:37:31,233 --> 00:37:32,800
I will do my best

509
00:37:35,367 --> 00:37:37,100
Brother Zhixun

510
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,267
Are you...

511
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:42,767
Wait

512
00:37:42,767 --> 00:37:45,367
(Yun Jae-hyung)
I'll just go in when I get there.

513
00:37:45,367 --> 00:37:46,967
Yun Jae is here!

514
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:49,500
I couldn't tell you.

515
00:37:50,433 --> 00:37:52,300
As expected, being with you is very useful.

516
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:55,167
Is it allowed?

517
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:56,867
Is Yun-jae coming?

518
00:37:56,867 --> 00:37:57,867
Um

519
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,533
Why did you call him here?

520
00:38:00,533 --> 00:38:03,200
Yes, we can play together after get off work. What's wrong?

521
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:06,633
If it weren't for my current state, how could I ask him to come?

522
00:38:06,633 --> 00:38:10,200
Very handsome, like a real Sungkyunkwan scholar

523
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:12,333
Yeah, I'm totally a scholar now.

524
00:38:13,833 --> 00:38:16,300
Sorry, I have to leave first.

525
00:38:17,067 --> 00:38:19,133
Where are we going? We're about to enter the second phase.

526
00:38:19,133 --> 00:38:21,900
It's not time for me to go on stage.

527
00:38:22,633 --> 00:38:25,000
I need to collect 200,000 yuan

528
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,867
Still no use

529
00:38:29,867 --> 00:38:31,200
Brother Zhixun

530
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,267
Brother Zhixun

531
00:38:44,567 --> 00:38:45,700
hateful

532
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,033
Brother Zhixun

533
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:53,567
Are you crazy?

534
00:38:53,567 --> 00:38:54,933
What to do?

535
00:38:57,233 --> 00:38:58,567
Minjoo

536
00:38:58,567 --> 00:38:59,633
Where is Zhixun?

537
00:38:59,633 --> 00:39:01,767
Did you lend him money?

538
00:39:01,767 --> 00:39:03,167
What nonsense are you talking about?

539
00:39:03,167 --> 00:39:05,967
I don't know if he ran away when he heard you coming.

540
00:39:05,967 --> 00:39:07,833
It's not Cinderella

541
00:39:07,833 --> 00:39:08,967
What are you doing?

542
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:13,667
I really don't understand him.

543
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:15,100
There is money to be made and still run away

544
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:17,333
It was fine before you came.

545
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:24,033
Let's change clothes next time.

546
00:39:24,033 --> 00:39:25,900
My life bucket list

547
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:29,367
Why next time?

548
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:30,200
Let's go

549
00:39:30,200 --> 00:39:33,833
No, I didn't wear makeup today.

550
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,233
She is beautiful even without makeup

551
00:39:37,233 --> 00:39:39,433
don't want

552
00:39:39,433 --> 00:39:41,733
Wait until I'm ready

553
00:39:41,733 --> 00:39:45,500
I want to date you and take lots of commemorative photos

554
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:47,967
Also choose beautiful Korean clothes

555
00:39:49,833 --> 00:39:51,333
good

556
00:39:51,333 --> 00:39:52,700
It's agreed

557
00:39:54,367 --> 00:39:55,733
but

558
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:58,333
Don't you think I look good in Hanbok?

559
00:39:58,333 --> 00:40:00,000
You'll be shocked

560
00:40:01,033 --> 00:40:04,667
I am the best for you

561
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:16,067
You guys had a fight, didn't you?

562
00:40:16,067 --> 00:40:18,633
Minjoo will start getting ready in ten minutes.

563
00:40:21,067 --> 00:40:21,967
what to do

564
00:40:23,733 --> 00:40:25,233
There's no other way. Come on.

565
00:40:25,767 --> 00:40:26,800
what

566
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:28,267
No time left

567
00:40:37,233 --> 00:40:39,900
(Following the brilliant autumn sky, I pursue the you that haunts my dreams)

568
00:41:07,267 --> 00:41:09,633
Young Master and Young Lady, Please Hug Me

569
00:41:28,267 --> 00:41:29,133
Really

570
00:41:30,900 --> 00:41:32,400
Since it's the last moment of the day

571
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:34,767
Please kiss the girl's lips

572
00:41:37,300 --> 00:41:38,533
We'll pay more.

573
00:41:38,533 --> 00:41:39,933
It'll start in ten seconds.

574
00:41:55,133 --> 00:41:59,533
"This moment is incredible."

575
00:42:02,267 --> 00:42:06,467
"The same temperature, the same throbbing"

576
00:42:09,567 --> 00:42:13,967
"In the blurry sunset light"

577
00:42:15,900 --> 00:42:21,300
"The light called you gradually seeps in"

578
00:42:24,267 --> 00:42:28,533
"The way you look at me"

579
00:42:31,833 --> 00:42:36,133
1987

580
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:41,000
Six five four three

581
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,133
two

582
00:42:42,133 --> 00:42:43,100
one

583
00:42:47,733 --> 00:42:48,767
Stop

584
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:50,400
What

585
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:04,967
Young Master

586
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:10,500
You're still alive

587
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:26,133
You guy

588
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,900
You're a heinous bastard.

589
00:43:31,367 --> 00:43:34,500
He actually tried to snatch the girl away when I was away

590
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:50,467
I knew you would come to save me.

591
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:54,600
I'm really sorry, girl.

592
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:56,733
I'm late

593
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,067
Seeing you come back alive is enough

594
00:44:01,833 --> 00:44:03,167
Since I came back alive

595
00:44:04,033 --> 00:44:05,567
So now...

596
00:44:07,967 --> 00:44:09,133
what to do

597
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:14,967
Kill him

598
00:44:17,733 --> 00:44:18,967
This will end

599
00:44:28,167 --> 00:44:29,267
You guy

600
00:44:30,200 --> 00:44:31,600
Die

601
00:44:44,600 --> 00:44:45,967
OMG

602
00:44:49,667 --> 00:44:50,667
You are dead

603
00:44:51,667 --> 00:44:52,900
Pretend to be dead

604
00:44:55,267 --> 00:44:56,800
Why are you standing there?

605
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:57,667
Pretend to be dead

606
00:44:58,533 --> 00:44:59,633
Hurry up and pretend to be dead

607
00:45:43,333 --> 00:45:45,767
The udon you ordered is here.

608
00:45:45,767 --> 00:45:47,433
Please take your time

609
00:45:47,433 --> 00:45:49,533
Please help me check out. Okay, please wait.

610
00:45:51,067 --> 00:45:52,333
Please take your time

611
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,067
Do you need an invoice?

612
00:46:02,067 --> 00:46:03,167
No need

613
00:46:03,167 --> 00:46:04,067
That's it.

614
00:46:04,067 --> 00:46:06,000
Thank you for visiting us again.

615
00:46:15,567 --> 00:46:18,233
I only treated you to a bowl of udon, but it made you work so hard. What should I do?

616
00:46:19,667 --> 00:46:22,533
It's okay, I'll eat another bowl later.

617
00:46:22,533 --> 00:46:23,867
Do you want another bowl?

618
00:46:39,767 --> 00:46:41,933
(Keep doing your best today!)

619
00:46:43,333 --> 00:46:45,367
Why hasn't he returned yet?

620
00:46:47,467 --> 00:46:49,200
This guy is so rude.

621
00:46:50,167 --> 00:46:51,900
Let me see what you uploaded

622
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:52,900
Sit down first

623
00:47:00,633 --> 00:47:02,100
OMG

624
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:04,067
No wonder he didn't reply

625
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:06,967
Listen carefully

626
00:47:06,967 --> 00:47:10,233
If Hong Young-suk, who wanted Noryangjin to retake the exam eight times, takes action

627
00:47:10,233 --> 00:47:11,500
You shouldn't be cheering him on.

628
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:13,133
To make him worry

629
00:47:13,933 --> 00:47:15,500
Are you worried?

630
00:47:15,500 --> 00:47:17,433
OK Worry

631
00:47:18,600 --> 00:47:23,233
When Yingshuo first started preparing for the civil service exam, he failed two or three times.

632
00:47:23,233 --> 00:47:25,433
I also seriously cheered him on.

633
00:47:25,433 --> 00:47:28,567
How many bowls of ginseng chicken soup did I cook for him?

634
00:47:28,567 --> 00:47:31,900
But this guy stopped coming from a certain point

635
00:47:31,900 --> 00:47:32,667
Why

636
00:47:32,667 --> 00:47:35,933
Maybe he felt that I was burdened by doing that.

637
00:47:35,933 --> 00:47:38,767
I never passed the exam and I don't have the face to come

638
00:47:38,767 --> 00:47:40,900
No one comes despite repeated calls

639
00:47:40,900 --> 00:47:42,867
Do you know why he came to our store later?

640
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:44,700
I don't know why

641
00:47:44,700 --> 00:47:46,533
I had back surgery.

642
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:50,267
I don't know how this guy heard the news and came to the store to find me

643
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,567
Help me clean and carry things

644
00:47:52,567 --> 00:47:54,367
And pickled kimchi with me

645
00:47:55,833 --> 00:47:58,100
I knew it then

646
00:47:58,100 --> 00:48:00,433
Figured out the trick

647
00:48:00,433 --> 00:48:03,267
If you want him to have a warm meal

648
00:48:03,267 --> 00:48:05,633
Make him worry

649
00:48:05,633 --> 00:48:07,100
Do you understand now?

650
00:48:08,067 --> 00:48:09,267
Do you understand?

651
00:48:09,267 --> 00:48:10,267
Understand

652
00:48:24,533 --> 00:48:26,500
Is it too obvious?

653
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:30,900
My voice didn't sound good when I was on the phone just now.

654
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:33,167
Should I send him a message to tell him I'm fine?

655
00:48:33,167 --> 00:48:35,900
Or I admit that it was my aunt who taught me

656
00:48:38,067 --> 00:48:40,200
How weird is this?

657
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,400
Feed Jin Zhihui

658
00:48:43,833 --> 00:48:44,933
What's the situation?

659
00:48:44,933 --> 00:48:45,733
Are you okay?

660
00:48:51,533 --> 00:48:55,067
Maybe I twisted my ankle because I walked too fast.

661
00:48:55,067 --> 00:48:56,567
Sit down first.

662
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,633
Where is the person who just followed you?

663
00:48:59,633 --> 00:49:03,533
He's gone. I must have seen it wrong.

664
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:06,200
sorry

665
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:08,400
You are busy reading

666
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:11,100
But you are the only one I know in Noryangjin

667
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:13,400
Of course you should contact me. What's there to be sorry about?

668
00:49:15,433 --> 00:49:16,767
Can you walk?

669
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,633
It's not so serious that I can't walk.

670
00:49:23,533 --> 00:49:25,133
Wait me a moment

671
00:49:25,133 --> 00:49:28,000
It's too late now. The hospital is closed.

672
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,433
It doesn't matter

673
00:49:29,433 --> 00:49:33,033
Could you just walk with me to the bus stop in front?

674
00:49:34,867 --> 00:49:36,000
Is it really okay?

675
00:49:37,967 --> 00:49:40,000
Good luck with your bag

676
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,667
Come hold my hand

677
00:49:42,367 --> 00:49:44,400
one two three

678
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:45,200
Hey

679
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:46,067
careful…

680
00:49:46,067 --> 00:49:47,567
Oh, what should I do?

681
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:50,300
This way is good

682
00:49:50,300 --> 00:49:51,067
Be careful of the threshold

683
00:49:51,933 --> 00:49:53,100
Hey

684
00:49:58,533 --> 00:50:00,233
You must see a doctor tomorrow.

685
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:01,933
You used to fall a lot when you were in school.

686
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:06,333
So you remember

687
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:09,200
My memories of my school days

688
00:50:09,200 --> 00:50:10,833
I was the only one who was handsome

689
00:50:10,833 --> 00:50:12,267
And you're funny

690
00:50:12,267 --> 00:50:13,467
Only these two things

691
00:50:14,367 --> 00:50:16,467
You are handsome now too.

692
00:50:16,467 --> 00:50:19,300
I still remember that you had poor eyesight but never wore glasses

693
00:50:22,600 --> 00:50:24,267
After laser surgery

694
00:50:24,267 --> 00:50:26,900
I found the world was more beautiful before

695
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:27,967
Because it's not clear

696
00:50:27,967 --> 00:50:30,100
Is that why you like me?

697
00:50:30,100 --> 00:50:32,500
Hey, you used to sit next to me

698
00:50:32,500 --> 00:50:34,133
When I look at you, I am always very close to you

699
00:50:35,500 --> 00:50:37,467
You used to be very nice to me

700
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:40,600
careful

701
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,167
good

702
00:50:41,167 --> 00:50:42,900
Ouch... What should I do?

703
00:50:43,567 --> 00:50:44,700
Does it hurt?

704
00:50:44,700 --> 00:50:46,200
A little bit

705
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,467
careful…

706
00:50:47,467 --> 00:50:48,767
Walk slower...

707
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,233
Which bus number do you take?

708
00:50:55,233 --> 00:50:56,500
No. 129

709
00:50:56,500 --> 00:50:58,400
Number 129 is coming soon

710
00:50:59,500 --> 00:51:00,867
It came so fast

711
00:51:02,067 --> 00:51:03,367
You must see a doctor tomorrow.

712
00:51:04,367 --> 00:51:05,867
good

713
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:07,167
Come

714
00:51:08,900 --> 00:51:10,533
Go back

715
00:51:10,533 --> 00:51:11,667
goodbye

716
00:51:25,433 --> 00:51:26,500
Let's take a taxi

717
00:51:26,500 --> 00:51:27,433
I'll take you back

718
00:51:28,167 --> 00:51:29,833
No, it's okay.

719
00:51:34,400 --> 00:51:36,433
I will be worried if you go home alone

720
00:51:36,433 --> 00:51:38,033
Can't read books

721
00:51:45,167 --> 00:51:47,467
It's serious that I can't read.

722
00:52:01,867 --> 00:52:03,333
Is it funny?

723
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:04,600
Isn't it funny?

724
00:52:04,600 --> 00:52:06,900
You killed Park Yun-jae with your own hands.

725
00:52:06,900 --> 00:52:08,800
I didn't kill him.

726
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:11,967
That Jiang Min Zhou or the woman with the stinky Min Zhou name is really a headache

727
00:52:11,967 --> 00:52:14,433
How could she find you?

728
00:52:14,433 --> 00:52:18,333
She must have never thought that I was Park Yun-jae's girlfriend

729
00:52:18,333 --> 00:52:20,167
She has been pretending to be familiar

730
00:52:20,167 --> 00:52:22,233
It's nice to have a friend who lives nearby.

731
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:26,400
She won't ask you to match her up with Park Yun-jae later, right?

732
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,667
No way, she knew Yun Jae had a girlfriend.

733
00:52:28,667 --> 00:52:30,000
Is it beautiful?

734
00:52:31,767 --> 00:52:32,733
Not ugly

735
00:52:32,733 --> 00:52:34,800
It looks very beautiful.

736
00:52:39,733 --> 00:52:40,933
Hello

737
00:52:40,933 --> 00:52:43,000
You are my only friend

738
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:45,600
There shouldn't be any secrets, right?

739
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,967
I have something to confess to you.

740
00:52:55,100 --> 00:52:56,167
Hello

741
00:52:56,167 --> 00:52:58,967
No, haven't we sorted it out?

742
00:52:58,967 --> 00:53:01,767
What nonsense are you talking about? It's not you this time.

743
00:53:04,967 --> 00:53:07,400
Do you have another man?

744
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:09,633
How are you jealous?

745
00:53:11,233 --> 00:53:13,100
Who is

746
00:53:13,100 --> 00:53:14,867
that is…

747
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:17,833
People you also know

748
00:53:18,967 --> 00:53:20,867
Someone I know too?

749
00:53:23,367 --> 00:53:27,333
Hey, you don't like Yun Jae, do you?

750
00:53:29,967 --> 00:53:31,633
Do you have any buttons on your body?

751
00:53:31,633 --> 00:53:34,300
No matter what you say, it will always lead back to Yun Jae

752
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,700
Could it be that I like Park Yoon Jae?

753
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:39,367
He's my only friend's boyfriend.

754
00:53:40,167 --> 00:53:43,600
Who else do we all know?

755
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:48,300
Could it be Min Hyuk?

756
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:50,300
dumbfounded

757
00:53:50,300 --> 00:53:53,300
You just said birds of a feather flock together.

758
00:53:53,300 --> 00:53:55,800
So you two are dating?

759
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,400
No

760
00:53:57,400 --> 00:53:59,467
But I kissed

761
00:53:59,467 --> 00:54:01,233
What

762
00:54:01,233 --> 00:54:06,133
I keep thinking of that scene

763
00:54:16,367 --> 00:54:20,033
In short, you should actively assist others without making any noise.

764
00:54:20,033 --> 00:54:21,400
Is it ok?

765
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,467
When I was dating Yun Jae

766
00:54:25,467 --> 00:54:27,633
How did you treat me...

767
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:30,600
It must be a blessing to you.

768
00:54:33,267 --> 00:54:35,733
It was a mistake from the moment you met

769
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:37,467
Didn't you expect the ending?

770
00:54:37,467 --> 00:54:39,033
It can only end in tragedy

771
00:54:39,033 --> 00:54:40,200
Break up soon

772
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:42,700
You're exaggerating. What a tragic ending.

773
00:54:42,700 --> 00:54:46,000
It's not that you both have your own dating partners.

774
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:48,133
Then you guys cheated

775
00:54:48,133 --> 00:54:49,600
No cheating

776
00:54:50,467 --> 00:54:52,633
It's just an acquaintance, that's all.

777
00:54:52,633 --> 00:54:53,533
How can cheating be so serious?

778
00:54:53,533 --> 00:54:56,533
No, break up quickly.

779
00:54:56,533 --> 00:55:00,767
I made an appointment with Yunzai to watch "The Moon Over You 3" tonight.

780
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:02,233
What did you say

781
00:55:02,233 --> 00:55:04,200
You watched episode one or two with me.

782
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:06,967
Who should I watch the third episode with?

783
00:55:06,967 --> 00:55:10,700
You can't be like this, can you?

784
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:14,367
Break up with me immediately

785
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,200
Do I have this?

786
00:55:18,300 --> 00:55:19,867
I don't remember

787
00:55:19,867 --> 00:55:21,000
Anyway, I understand

788
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:22,533
Congratulations, I will pray for you.

789
00:55:22,533 --> 00:55:24,267
I'm leaving

790
00:55:26,500 --> 00:55:28,467
goodbye

791
00:55:28,467 --> 00:55:30,867
Remember to always be careful of the woman next door

792
00:55:34,767 --> 00:55:35,600
(Glass Slippers)
What's this

793
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,733
Gifts for buying books

794
00:55:41,467 --> 00:55:43,567
Readers are very insightful lately.

795
00:55:43,567 --> 00:55:45,600
Isn't it childish to give these as gifts?

796
00:55:48,267 --> 00:55:49,533
What are you doing?

797
00:55:50,300 --> 00:55:53,100
Why are you playing at my house?

798
00:55:53,967 --> 00:55:54,733
Get out of here!

799
00:55:54,733 --> 00:55:57,067
Okay, I'm leaving.

800
00:55:57,067 --> 00:55:58,533
goodbye

801
00:56:08,467 --> 00:56:10,833
"Huff, huff, huff twice"

802
00:56:10,833 --> 00:56:13,400
"The hole will get bigger."

803
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:17,667
"Giant Marshmallow"

804
00:56:20,933 --> 00:56:22,400
Minjoo

805
00:56:24,900 --> 00:56:26,167
Dongqige

806
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:28,500
Why do you...

807
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:30,133
How did you get here?

808
00:56:30,133 --> 00:56:32,333
Because you haven't answered my calls.

809
00:56:32,333 --> 00:56:34,667
I want to wait for you here

810
00:56:35,500 --> 00:56:36,833
How am I

811
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:39,933
I bought this based on the clothes you gave me.

812
00:56:39,933 --> 00:56:43,033
I don't think I told you I live here

813
00:56:43,033 --> 00:56:44,333
Are you following me?

814
00:56:44,333 --> 00:56:47,067
No, I'm not following you.

815
00:56:47,533 --> 00:56:49,733
Last time you came home alone late at night

816
00:56:49,733 --> 00:56:51,433
I was worried, so I followed you here.

817
00:56:51,433 --> 00:56:53,633
This is tracking

818
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,033
I'm upset and angry now

819
00:56:57,633 --> 00:56:58,900
walk fast

820
00:56:59,967 --> 00:57:00,933
Come to the movies with me this weekend

821
00:57:00,933 --> 00:57:02,400
I have a date this weekend.

822
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:04,433
Even if you don't have an appointment, I won't go with you.

823
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:07,933
Why

824
00:57:09,533 --> 00:57:11,167
Think about it carefully.

825
00:57:11,167 --> 00:57:13,000
Why don't I want to

826
00:57:13,667 --> 00:57:16,233
I know but I like you

827
00:57:16,233 --> 00:57:19,333
I fell in love with you at first sight, you are the only one in my eyes

828
00:57:19,333 --> 00:57:20,933
That's your own business

829
00:57:20,933 --> 00:57:22,733
I will treat you well

830
00:57:22,733 --> 00:57:24,800
I will do better than that Park Yoon Jae

831
00:57:24,800 --> 00:57:26,567
Why did you mention Yun Jae?

832
00:57:26,567 --> 00:57:29,167
My credits are higher than his and my future is brighter.

833
00:57:29,167 --> 00:57:31,533
Just say my parents run a golf course

834
00:57:33,733 --> 00:57:35,300
elder brother

835
00:57:36,800 --> 00:57:38,600
If you say a few more words

836
00:57:38,600 --> 00:57:42,000
I really don't want to see you again

837
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,800
Do you want to continue?

838
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:49,567
If you still want to keep in touch with me in the future

839
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,767
Then leave quickly

840
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:55,067
And I never thought of you as a man

841
00:57:55,067 --> 00:57:57,933
I will never do that again.

842
00:57:58,933 --> 00:58:03,400
What should I do so that you will treat me as a man?

843
00:58:05,067 --> 00:58:07,033
Rebirth

844
00:58:07,033 --> 00:58:09,367
Then I'll consider it.

845
00:58:12,167 --> 00:58:13,967
Get out of the way

846
00:58:13,967 --> 00:58:16,000
Minjoo, can you please look at me?

847
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:17,100
Won't you let go?

848
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:18,767
I'm gonna scream

849
00:58:18,767 --> 00:58:20,333
Who can help me?

850
00:58:55,967 --> 00:58:58,667
(Postscript)

851
00:59:05,767 --> 00:59:07,700
(The Birth and Death of the Universe)

852
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,867
Our company coffee is delicious, right?

853
00:59:21,867 --> 00:59:23,267
right

854
00:59:25,367 --> 00:59:27,000
Where have you been?

855
00:59:27,000 --> 00:59:28,333
What

856
00:59:28,333 --> 00:59:31,400
You must have a company you prefer.

857
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,267
You didn't come to work in our company, right?

858
00:59:34,133 --> 00:59:36,000
Not so

859
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:39,567
It's okay, I'm not the boss of the company.

860
00:59:39,567 --> 00:59:41,500
I just...

861
00:59:41,500 --> 00:59:45,000
I want to work with you

862
00:59:45,867 --> 00:59:47,700
Me too

863
00:59:47,700 --> 00:59:51,033
I really want to work here

864
00:59:51,033 --> 00:59:53,467
What happened?

865
00:59:54,067 --> 00:59:55,367
because…

866
00:59:56,267 --> 00:59:59,433
My body doesn't listen to me.

867
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:02,733
Sorry, I don't know why.

868
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:05,300
Is it better now?

869
01:00:05,300 --> 01:00:07,600
Yes, I'm cured now.

870
01:00:07,600 --> 01:00:09,267
I will definitely come here again

871
01:00:09,267 --> 01:00:11,867
Even if it's just for this cup of coffee, I'll come

872
01:00:11,867 --> 01:00:13,600
good

873
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:15,333
Drink it up

874
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:28,533
(Thanks to Park Myung-shin for his special appearance)

875
01:00:57,967 --> 01:01:02,033
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

876
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:03,300
My parents went on a trip

877
01:01:03,300 --> 01:01:04,500
Because I want to play with you

878
01:01:04,500 --> 01:01:06,100
But what are you doing at home alone?

879
01:01:06,100 --> 01:01:07,700
What type of man do you like?

880
01:01:07,700 --> 01:01:10,400
I will actively look for the right person

881
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:12,433
Actually, I have someone I like.

882
01:01:12,433 --> 01:01:14,567
But I also have someone I like

883
01:01:14,567 --> 01:01:15,800
My first love

884
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:17,767
What should I do?

885
01:01:17,767 --> 01:01:20,633
I'm getting more and more used to being a boy recently.

886
01:01:20,633 --> 01:01:22,467
And this is for you.

887
01:01:22,467 --> 01:01:24,467
What should I do with her?

888
01:01:24,467 --> 01:01:27,200
You don't have other thoughts about me, do you?

889
01:01:27,200 --> 01:01:29,900
What's going on with you guys?
