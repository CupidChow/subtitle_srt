00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,100
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

6
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:43,100
Please wait a little longer.

7
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,500
After I become Yun Jae's girlfriend

8
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:48,433
I will go to eat with you again instead of as a schoolmate.

9
00:00:48,433 --> 00:00:49,433
good

10
00:00:49,433 --> 00:00:50,467
But you mean...

11
00:00:50,467 --> 00:00:54,500
Is our Yunzai's girlfriend someone else?

12
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:56,067
If even the parents don't know

13
00:00:56,067 --> 00:00:58,133
It means they are not seriously dating.

14
00:00:58,133 --> 00:01:00,333
Don't worry, I'll take good care of him.

15
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:01,867
Very serious relationship

16
00:01:02,933 --> 00:01:05,033
Love to death

17
00:01:08,367 --> 00:01:10,033
How can I believe your one-sided words?

18
00:01:10,033 --> 00:01:11,500
Can only believe

19
00:01:12,233 --> 00:01:16,200
Because I am Park Yoon-jae's girlfriend

20
00:01:27,333 --> 00:01:28,800
What nonsense are you talking about?

21
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Don't you understand what's going on now?

22
00:01:41,933 --> 00:01:43,900
Of course I know

23
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:46,133
I want to say that my uncle and aunt were quite frightened.

24
00:01:46,133 --> 00:01:49,367
Just wanted to tell you a little joke

25
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:57,933
Really

Are you awake?

30

Yunzai

31
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:08,033
What's going on?

32
00:02:08,033 --> 00:02:09,233
Yun Jae, don't you remember?

33
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:11,200
You fainted in the restaurant.

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:12,600
The doctor said it was indigestion

35
00:02:13,333 --> 00:02:14,767
Please make way, please make way

36
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:16,233
Excuse me

37
00:02:20,067 --> 00:02:21,567
Are you okay?

38
00:02:21,567 --> 00:02:22,767
I'm fine

39
00:02:24,767 --> 00:02:26,267
Really

40
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,067
Fortunately, I'm fine. Sorry.

41
00:02:29,067 --> 00:02:31,000
Who told you to eat everything?

42
00:02:34,767 --> 00:02:36,133
Thanks a lot

43
00:02:36,133 --> 00:02:37,400
No

44
00:02:38,333 --> 00:02:39,100
Thank you

45
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:44,533
Fortunately, nothing happened

46
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:45,633
It's really worrying

(Emergency Medical Center)

48
00:03:19,567 --> 00:03:21,167
Hello Park Yun-jae

49
00:03:21,167 --> 00:03:22,867
How did you run out?

50
00:03:22,867 --> 00:03:24,367
So what are you doing here?

51
00:03:24,367 --> 00:03:26,633
How could the patient escape?

52
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:29,167
I just have indigestion.

53
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:32,000
Then you can't run around.

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,333
It's okay

55
00:03:33,333 --> 00:03:34,867
It's better to be fine

56
00:03:36,067 --> 00:03:37,633
Look, you're sweating.

57
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:39,333
Come back with me quickly

58
00:03:43,367 --> 00:03:45,167
I feel dizzy, please stand by for three minutes.

59
00:03:48,733 --> 00:03:51,500
It will only take a minute.

60
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:57,167
"I'll hear you"

61
00:03:57,167 --> 00:03:58,900
"Eyes don't lie"

62

"Oh it's you"

63
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:05,633
"Please remember my promise to you"

64
00:04:05,633 --> 00:04:08,067
"At any moment"

65
00:04:08,067 --> 00:04:11,800
"I'll see you"

Yun Jae

67
00:04:27,467 --> 00:04:29,233
What are you two doing here?

68
00:04:30,567 --> 00:04:32,467
Yoon Jae said he felt dizzy

69
00:04:32,467 --> 00:04:34,700
Of course, he's not well yet.

70
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,367
We should send him back immediately. What are you doing?

71
00:04:37,367 --> 00:04:38,667
I'm going back

72
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:41,900
Not a child

73
00:04:43,167 --> 00:04:44,933
Then you walk carefully

74
00:04:44,933 --> 00:04:46,700
Go back, your uncle and aunt are waiting for you.

75

78
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:41,400
Yun Jae, are you free now?

79
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
Um

81
00:05:47,167 --> 00:05:48,200
What's going on?

82
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,500
Thank you

83
00:05:59,433 --> 00:06:01,800
Thank you for last time

84
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,433
I didn't expect to faint due to indigestion.

85
00:06:03,433 --> 00:06:06,500
Yeah, do you know how scared I was?

86
00:06:07,833 --> 00:06:10,767
But you don't want to get rid of me with a cup of coffee, do you?

87
00:06:10,767 --> 00:06:12,067
Do you have something you want?

88
00:06:12,067 --> 00:06:13,067
Um

89
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:14,667
Park Yun-jae

90
00:06:14,667 --> 00:06:16,167
What

91
00:06:17,233 --> 00:06:19,267
A new spicy hot pot restaurant opened at the back door

92
00:06:19,267 --> 00:06:20,767
Please treat me to a meal tomorrow

93
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,467
I have an experiment to do today.

94
00:06:22,467 --> 00:06:23,667
Tomorrow?

95
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Okay, let's go eat.

96
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,067
Really

97
00:06:29,067 --> 00:06:30,433
Good

98
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:34,000
Do you like spicy hot pot so much?

99
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,767
I like it because I eat with you.

100
00:06:36,767 --> 00:06:39,833
Cheese rice cake, wide noodles, sausage and quail eggs

101
00:06:39,833 --> 00:06:43,467
And fish balls, add them all

102
00:06:43,467 --> 00:06:45,633
I want to eat with you for a long, long time

103
00:06:45,633 --> 00:06:48,633
Okay, add them all.

104
00:06:52,133 --> 00:06:54,967
Yeah, I have something curious.

105
00:06:54,967 --> 00:06:58,267
What is your relationship with Kim Ji-hoon?

106
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:02,367
What does this mean?

107
00:07:02,367 --> 00:07:03,467
Why do you ask that?

108
00:07:03,467 --> 00:07:06,067
No, this time in the emergency room

109
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,967
And last time at the nightclub

110
00:07:07,967 --> 00:07:10,367
I see how he treats you.

111
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,500
How should I put it…

112
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:14,433
Doesn't feel like an ordinary friend

113
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:19,233
Zhixun is kind

114
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:23,867
No matter how kind you are, you wouldn't go to the emergency room.

115
00:07:23,867 --> 00:07:25,400
Really loyal

116
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:29,100
Didn't you send me to the emergency room too?

117
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,167
Probably about the same as you.

118
00:07:30,167 --> 00:07:32,000
It's almost bad.

119
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:34,700
Because I like you

120
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,867
But that brother Zhixun

121
00:07:38,867 --> 00:07:41,300
Said strange things in the emergency room

122
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,567
He said he was your girlfriend

123
00:07:50,267 --> 00:07:51,367
Feel sorry

124
00:07:52,267 --> 00:07:53,767
Sorry, are you okay?

125
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,533
It's okay

126
00:07:57,567 --> 00:07:58,900
here

127
00:08:01,267 --> 00:08:02,467
Here are also

128
00:08:03,067 --> 00:08:05,067
It also sprayed here and here

129
00:08:07,767 --> 00:08:09,267
It sprayed here too.

130
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,233
Here too

131
00:08:14,167 --> 00:08:15,833
It sprayed here too.

132
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:21,500
I know, but it's better if you wipe it yourself.

133
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,467
What? I like this dress very much.

134
00:08:26,167 --> 00:08:28,433
Sorry, I'll pay for your laundry.

135
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:31,367
No need, I'm just kidding.

136
00:08:31,367 --> 00:08:33,067
This is nothing.

137
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,067
Why are you so panicked?

138
00:08:42,167 --> 00:08:43,567
Park Yun-jae

139
00:08:48,733 --> 00:08:49,567
You're coming to school.

140
00:08:49,567 --> 00:08:51,867
I sent a message saying I'd come to tidy up the locker.

141
00:08:51,867 --> 00:08:52,900
Is there?

142
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,533
message…

143
00:08:58,233 --> 00:08:59,367
Why didn't I see the message?

144
00:08:59,367 --> 00:09:00,933
Because I didn't pass

145
00:09:01,667 --> 00:09:03,767
Even if it was uploaded, you probably wouldn't have time to read it.

146
00:09:07,633 --> 00:09:10,233
You're here to pack up.

147
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:12,333
Why don't you say something first?

148
00:09:12,333 --> 00:09:13,633
We meet again

149
00:09:13,633 --> 00:09:16,000
But do you also study in our school?

150
00:09:18,933 --> 00:09:20,300
No comment

151
00:09:22,833 --> 00:09:25,200
This question is not difficult to answer. Is it necessary to do so?

152
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,033
I've been thinking about this before

153
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:30,467
Do you like to take the mysterious route?

154
00:09:30,467 --> 00:09:31,500
What

155
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:36,000
Because every time we meet, I feel like you're hiding something.

156
00:09:37,833 --> 00:09:41,467
Did you hear that? She said I was hiding everything.

157
00:09:41,467 --> 00:09:43,700
I never thought I would hear such nonsense in my life.

158
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:45,133
You haven't eaten yet?

159
00:09:45,133 --> 00:09:48,400
I heard there's a spicy hot pot restaurant behind the door. Do you want to go?

160
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,300
Isn't that what I told you?

161
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:51,533
What

162
00:09:51,533 --> 00:09:54,167
Do you want to take me to the store this woman recommended?

163
00:09:54,167 --> 00:09:56,867
This woman, did you just call me this woman?

164
00:09:56,867 --> 00:09:58,500
So what?

165
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:00,867
This man, this woman, that man, that woman

166
00:10:00,867 --> 00:10:02,933
I call everyone that.

167
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:06,067
No wonder they say you can't judge a person by his appearance

168
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,900
Are you talking about yourself?

169
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,667
It seems you think I'm good-looking too.

170
00:10:11,667 --> 00:10:13,567
I'm prettier than you.

171
00:10:13,567 --> 00:10:15,933
Why are you two so good looking?

172
00:10:15,933 --> 00:10:17,800
So... what

173
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:20,000
Are both good looking?

174
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,600
What I mean is…

175
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:25,000
We are two good-looking people arguing, please get out of the way.

176
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,700
I'm so dumbfounded.

177
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm more dumbfounded, okay?

178
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,333
Stop arguing, let's go eat spicy hot pot.

179
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:34,800
Good luck on your experiment

180
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:36,933
etc…

181
00:10:37,867 --> 00:10:39,933
If you go with me, the boss will treat you to wide noodles.

182
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,800
Don't you still want to do experiments?

183
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:44,000
Just eat spicy hot pot and then stay up late to make it

184
00:10:46,067 --> 00:10:47,500
Hey, can you let me go?

185
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:49,533
Let's go...

186
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:50,867
Don't let go yet

187
00:10:50,867 --> 00:10:52,233
Let go

188
00:11:02,933 --> 00:11:04,867
We're going in, let go.

189
00:11:04,867 --> 00:11:06,533
You should let go.

190
00:11:07,067 --> 00:11:08,833
You two let go

191
00:11:08,833 --> 00:11:10,267
I don't want

192
00:11:11,567 --> 00:11:12,900
I don't want it either

193
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,733
Wait a moment

194
00:11:25,300 --> 00:11:26,767
Come in

195
00:11:26,767 --> 00:11:28,333
What the hell?

196
00:11:33,333 --> 00:11:34,567
What are you doing?

197
00:11:34,567 --> 00:11:35,933
Let go

198
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,267
What are you doing? This is my seat. Please let me go.

199
00:11:41,267 --> 00:11:42,800
I don't like sitting by the window.

200
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,033
I also get tanned.

201
00:11:45,033 --> 00:11:46,667
If you put on so much makeup, you'll probably get tanned.

202
00:11:46,667 --> 00:11:49,167
What nonsense! I'm almost without makeup!

203
00:11:49,867 --> 00:11:52,333
Hurry over there, everyone is watching

204
00:11:57,900 --> 00:11:58,967
What are you doing?

205
00:12:08,233 --> 00:12:09,433
Sit down

206
00:12:23,033 --> 00:12:24,867
Do you seem too strong to me?

207
00:12:24,867 --> 00:12:25,933
No

208
00:12:42,033 --> 00:12:44,933
This finally has a spicy aroma.

209
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,300
Is there anything wrong? I still feel a little indifferent.

210
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,767
Yunzai, go get some more fish balls.

211
00:12:57,767 --> 00:12:59,767
(Note: The Korean word "fish balls" sounds like a swear word)
The fish eggs here are delicious

212
00:13:00,733 --> 00:13:03,200
If you want fish balls, go get them yourself.

213
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,633
Why are you ordering Yun Jae around?

214
00:13:07,633 --> 00:13:09,833
Do you want me to get it?

215
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,900
I'll go get it.

216
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:31,267
Very spicy

217
00:13:34,267 --> 00:13:35,433
Really

218
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:38,467
I know you're being stubborn.

219
00:13:40,667 --> 00:13:43,000
Don't play with her. I don't like her.

220
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,667
How could I play with her?

221
00:13:44,667 --> 00:13:46,300
You two are playing, right?

222
00:13:47,333 --> 00:13:49,767
Why did you ask me to eat spicy hot pot?

223
00:13:49,767 --> 00:13:51,900
And if she says she wants to follow you, will you let her follow you?

224
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,467
I really can't stand you

225
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:55,400
Very spicy

226
00:14:13,833 --> 00:14:15,000
Very spicy

227
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,333
Did you see that I won?

228
00:14:19,333 --> 00:14:21,500
I drank the last sip of soup

229
00:14:24,867 --> 00:14:27,133
It's really spicy Park Yun-jae

230
00:14:27,133 --> 00:14:29,833
My lips are swollen and look like they're broken.

231
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,600
It's been a while since I last saw this.

232
00:14:33,433 --> 00:14:35,433
You are so nonchalant

233
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:38,100
And I, who acted as if nothing had happened

234
00:14:39,167 --> 00:14:41,633
As an ordinary couple

235
00:14:41,633 --> 00:14:43,133
We are teasing

236
00:14:47,067 --> 00:14:48,900
I really want to kiss you

237
00:14:50,933 --> 00:14:52,033
What

238
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:57,233
What

239
00:14:57,800 --> 00:14:59,833
What did you just say?

240
00:14:59,833 --> 00:15:01,100
Me?

241
00:15:02,667 --> 00:15:04,967
Did I speak?

242
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,600
Hello

243
00:15:31,367 --> 00:15:33,467
What are you doing?

244
00:15:33,467 --> 00:15:35,833
It doesn't matter. There aren't many people here.

245
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:37,433
Just tell me.

246
00:15:47,900 --> 00:15:50,567
(Open for business)

247
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,067
Thanks

248
00:15:52,533 --> 00:15:54,833
But this book is not mine.

249
00:15:54,833 --> 00:15:57,167
Really? It fell on the seat.

250
00:16:06,633 --> 00:16:08,833
If you insist on not being hospitalized

251
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:12,667
It wouldn't be strange if your father died suddenly tomorrow

252
00:16:12,667 --> 00:16:14,733
What should Yingshuo do now?

253
00:16:16,467 --> 00:16:17,567
I'll take Dad with me.

254
00:16:17,567 --> 00:16:20,200
If you don't have a partner to marry, don't come back.

255
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,000
Your dad left.

256
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,367
I can't bear to see my son beaten to death.

257
00:16:24,367 --> 00:16:25,433
that's all

258
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:39,267
(Pray for passing. I can do it)

259
00:16:45,633 --> 00:16:47,100
Hello, Miss Zhengci

260
00:16:57,233 --> 00:16:59,700
Sorry, have you been waiting for a long time?

261
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:01,633
Why are you here at this time?

262
00:17:01,633 --> 00:17:04,267
Why do you think that is?

263
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:07,333
Of course I came to see you.

264
00:17:08,067 --> 00:17:09,233
Get on the bus

265
00:17:12,800 --> 00:17:13,967
Take it

266
00:17:18,467 --> 00:17:20,067
What's this

267
00:17:20,067 --> 00:17:22,567
If you're curious, just open it and you'll know.

268
00:17:33,167 --> 00:17:34,967
Are you giving this to me?

269
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,867
Why... Oh my god

270
00:17:36,867 --> 00:17:40,367
This is worse than asking me to give you a watch.

271
00:17:40,367 --> 00:17:42,000
Why?

272
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,300
I'm sorry, I mean

273
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:47,167
Am I worthy of this watch? Of course I am.

274
00:17:47,933 --> 00:17:49,600
Don't you remember?

275
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,600
Thirteen minutes after our first meeting

276
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,400
I waited for 45 minutes for the stewed anglerfish.

277
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,533
A total of 58 minutes

278
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:57,567
sorry

279
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:59,867
If I'm late, that's fine.

280
00:17:59,867 --> 00:18:01,833
It's been a long time since anyone has been like you.

281
00:18:01,833 --> 00:18:04,133
Made me wait so long

282
00:18:04,133 --> 00:18:06,500
This is a gift meant to make you feel guilty.

283
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:08,033
Just take it.

284
00:18:08,533 --> 00:18:12,400
Sorry, I'm not the type to be late.

285
00:18:13,867 --> 00:18:15,933
No, these are all excuses.

286
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:17,133
sorry

287
00:18:17,133 --> 00:18:19,433
Can you please stop saying sorry?

288
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:22,600
Because I'm used to it

289
00:18:23,333 --> 00:18:24,767
sorry

290
00:18:24,767 --> 00:18:27,000
No, I won't be sorry.

291
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,933
That's not what I meant... It's getting too much.

292
00:18:29,933 --> 00:18:33,000
Do you have nothing to say to me except sorry?

293
00:18:33,867 --> 00:18:36,500
Why do you look exactly like my dad today?

294
00:18:38,233 --> 00:18:40,667
If you dare to say sorry again

295
00:18:40,667 --> 00:18:42,533
My sister will really teach you a lesson

296
00:18:42,533 --> 00:18:44,000
I warned you.

297
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:51,200
I am easily frightened by loud voices

298
00:18:53,100 --> 00:18:54,333
sorry

299
00:19:03,467 --> 00:19:06,000
I told you I'd teach you a lesson if you apologize again.

300
00:19:07,300 --> 00:19:09,100
I won't let you off so easily next time.

301
00:19:23,333 --> 00:19:25,633
(Mission of Love)

302
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,433
Hello

303
00:19:34,433 --> 00:19:37,767
I am the first in the industry to have successfully matched 700,000 couples.

304
00:19:37,767 --> 00:19:40,633
Love Mission Marriage Agency, Team Leader Jin Zhihui

305
00:19:43,367 --> 00:19:44,800
Shin Dong-hoon

306
00:19:46,567 --> 00:19:50,933
Ideal type: a professional who graduated from a top university

307
00:19:50,933 --> 00:19:54,233
Women who have strict self-discipline

308
00:19:54,233 --> 00:19:57,000
Considering eugenics, the height should be over 170 cm.

309
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:01,267
I don't like type B because my mother is type B.

310
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:04,833
Type Bs often quarrel with each other and want to avoid mother-in-law and daughter-in-law problems.

311
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:07,233
Do you have a cigarette

312
00:20:07,233 --> 00:20:08,600
Let's go

313
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,833
Thank you

314
00:20:24,667 --> 00:20:26,900
(Team Leader, smoking is harmful to your health, quit now!!)

315
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:34,133
You are really happy in your working life.

316
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,967
Quit one of smoking and drinking

317
00:20:37,500 --> 00:20:41,000
There's no need to ruin your health for this kind of company.

318
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,100
Thank you

319
00:20:46,233 --> 00:20:48,467
This company only cares about me.

320
00:20:48,467 --> 00:20:49,867
It's just you

321
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,667
Oh, by the way, Team Leader

322
00:20:55,033 --> 00:20:56,567
I'm planning to quit my job.

323
00:20:58,167 --> 00:21:00,700
Have you really made up your mind this time?

324
00:21:01,867 --> 00:21:03,533
Before it's too late

325
00:21:03,533 --> 00:21:07,533
I'm going to find my true dream and love

326
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:12,700
Dreams and love

327
00:21:14,867 --> 00:21:16,167
So handsome

328
00:21:16,167 --> 00:21:17,500
come on

329
00:21:26,567 --> 00:21:27,900
Hello

330
00:21:31,233 --> 00:21:32,867
Hi Yun Jae

331
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,767
Hello, Sister Zhihui

332
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:40,067
Did I scare you by coming to the company to find you?

333
00:21:40,067 --> 00:21:42,000
Yes, a little

334
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,700
Why did you suddenly come here? Is it because of Zhien?

335
00:21:44,700 --> 00:21:47,100
Of course it's about her.

336
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,800
If you want to break up with Jin Zhien

337
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,733
But I'm sorry to bring this up.

338
00:21:53,733 --> 00:21:54,900
I can’t…

339
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:56,500
It's not like that

340
00:21:56,500 --> 00:22:01,067
If that situation really happens

341
00:22:01,067 --> 00:22:02,867
I won't be so cowardly.

342
00:22:02,867 --> 00:22:04,433
Please help me break up

343
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:06,900
Right

344
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:08,300
yes

345
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:12,833
What is that?

346
00:22:12,833 --> 00:22:15,333
You want to meet me without telling Zhien

347
00:22:19,833 --> 00:22:21,867
(Public toilet)

348
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:27,167
Dead pervert

349
00:22:27,167 --> 00:22:30,167
sorry…

350
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:32,700
The hardest part?

351
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,833
After all, I changed from a girl to a boy

352
00:22:35,833 --> 00:22:39,367
Everything is awkward and uncomfortable.

353
00:22:40,733 --> 00:22:44,167
Look, the bra and panties don't match again.

354
00:22:44,167 --> 00:22:45,133
Give me

355
00:22:45,133 --> 00:22:46,967
You look like that

356
00:22:46,967 --> 00:22:48,567
What about bras?

357
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:50,433
If not a bra, what should I call it?

358
00:22:50,433 --> 00:22:51,967
Okay, shut up.

359
00:22:55,633 --> 00:22:57,400
Why is she angry?

360
00:23:01,833 --> 00:23:05,167
Family, friends and people around you

361
00:23:05,167 --> 00:23:07,533
Getting along with each other is different from before

362
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:12,933
(Recruiting Baristas)

363
00:23:12,933 --> 00:23:14,833
I'm also confused about the future

364
00:23:14,833 --> 00:23:17,667
(ID card ID card ID card!!!)
Don't talk about employment.

365
00:23:17,667 --> 00:23:19,733
It's hard to even find a job

366
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:24,267
(Recruiting part-time students is open to anyone regardless of gender)
I can't establish credit with my current identity.

367
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,800
"I'll see you"

368
00:23:29,267 --> 00:23:33,800
"Always I know more than I see"

369
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:35,733
"It's not a dream"

370
00:23:35,733 --> 00:23:39,100
"You become more vivid"

371
00:23:40,433 --> 00:23:42,700
"I'll hear you"

372
00:23:43,967 --> 00:23:45,800
"Eyes don't lie"

373
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:48,367
"Oh it's you"

374
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:52,467
"Please remember my promise to you"

375
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:54,900
"At any moment"

376
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,533
"I'll see you"

377
00:23:56,533 --> 00:23:58,533
Yun'e, let's go.

378
00:23:58,533 --> 00:24:00,600
Where is he going? Who is he?

379
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,167
have no idea

380
00:24:02,167 --> 00:24:04,100
Scare me

381
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:06,900
Yun'e

382
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:08,700
Yun'e, I have something to tell you.

383
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:10,167
What are you doing?

384
00:24:16,633 --> 00:24:19,067
The cosmetics you said you wanted

385
00:24:20,233 --> 00:24:22,533
Do you know you're scary now?

386
00:24:22,533 --> 00:24:23,900
What's scary?

387
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,600
I'm so kind to give you a gift

388
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,100
How about this warm smile of my brother?

389
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:30,433
Looks like a little monk who is possessed by evil spirits

390
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:32,767
What's wrong with you suddenly?

391
00:24:34,133 --> 00:24:36,567
Brother, I am

392
00:24:36,567 --> 00:24:40,100
I want to help you find your place as a senior high school student.

393
00:24:41,100 --> 00:24:42,900
Isn't it said that you shouldn't hit someone who smiles at you?

394
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,767
I really want to hit someone now

395
00:24:57,567 --> 00:24:59,033
It's really difficult

396
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,133
Who did you learn this from?

397
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:07,233
Kim Ji-hoon is currently on leave from Yeonhee University

398
00:25:07,233 --> 00:25:09,500
The reason is personal factors. My interest is reading.

399
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:11,667
The army is the army retired

400
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:13,033
The place of service is

401
00:25:15,700 --> 00:25:17,633
The place of service is...

402
00:25:20,833 --> 00:25:21,833
Yang Ping

403
00:25:21,833 --> 00:25:23,067
This is where I served in the army

404
00:25:23,067 --> 00:25:26,433
Tank driver

405
00:25:26,433 --> 00:25:28,167
What is a chariot?

406
00:25:29,567 --> 00:25:31,700
It's a tank

407
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:33,867
Forget it, just carry it to Yangping.

408
00:25:33,867 --> 00:25:35,767
I'll cover the rest for you.

409
00:25:37,433 --> 00:25:38,967
But Yunzai

410
00:25:38,967 --> 00:25:42,367
Will the tutor interview ask about military service?

411
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:46,500
Compared to whether you study at Yanxi University

412
00:25:46,500 --> 00:25:49,067
My dad cares more about whether you have served in the army.

413
00:25:49,067 --> 00:25:52,567
He is a sergeant with 30 years of service.

414
00:25:52,567 --> 00:25:55,467
Please understand

415
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:57,033
Remember this

416
00:25:57,033 --> 00:25:58,267
Yang Ping

417
00:25:59,033 --> 00:26:00,300
Yang Ping

418
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,933
good

419
00:26:01,933 --> 00:26:04,733
Yang Ping

420
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:10,967
Say hello

421
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:14,300
My name is Jin Zhixun and I study at Yanxi University

422
00:26:14,300 --> 00:26:15,667
Currently on leave

423
00:26:15,667 --> 00:26:18,067
The reason is personal factors. My interest is reading.

424
00:26:20,133 --> 00:26:21,167
Oh my god

425
00:26:21,167 --> 00:26:25,167
How many times have I been a tutor and spoken like a robot?

426
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:26,600
Don't be nervous

427
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:28,633
This isn't the first time we've met.

428
00:26:28,633 --> 00:26:30,867
How can I not be nervous?

429
00:26:30,867 --> 00:26:32,567
He's also an accomplice.

430
00:26:38,833 --> 00:26:41,433
Sit down and eat some fruit.

431
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,900
Please take a seat

432
00:26:51,867 --> 00:26:55,367
We don't have high expectations

433
00:26:55,367 --> 00:27:00,433
It doesn't make much difference if 25th becomes 22nd.

434
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:03,533
I've hired a tutor for you, why are your expectations so low?

435
00:27:03,533 --> 00:27:06,400
A daughter who never reads

436
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:08,433
I don't know what's wrong

437
00:27:08,433 --> 00:27:11,400
Suddenly said I want to find a tutor

438
00:27:11,400 --> 00:27:16,533
But when I heard that the handsome boy Zhixun was the tutor

439
00:27:16,533 --> 00:27:19,567
I immediately understood why.

440
00:27:21,433 --> 00:27:22,933
My daughter

441
00:27:22,933 --> 00:27:24,767
Just like me

442
00:27:25,767 --> 00:27:28,533
Very concerned about appearance

443
00:27:28,533 --> 00:27:30,333
What the fuck

444
00:27:30,333 --> 00:27:33,767
This kind of words can only fool people who have never seen my father.

445
00:27:37,567 --> 00:27:40,433
This kid is really funny.

446
00:27:42,033 --> 00:27:43,267
husband

447
00:27:43,267 --> 00:27:47,267
Our son brought his friends home last time

448
00:27:47,267 --> 00:27:49,167
When is it?

449
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:52,467
I think there is no more after junior high school.

450
00:27:52,467 --> 00:27:54,067
It's been many years.

451
00:27:54,067 --> 00:27:56,067
Boys are all like this

452
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:02,100
You don't have any friends yourself, yet you drag all the boys in the country into this?

453
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,267
teacher

454
00:28:03,267 --> 00:28:06,267
This is a wrong generalization, right?

455
00:28:06,267 --> 00:28:08,067
Yun-a is so smart

456
00:28:09,667 --> 00:28:12,167
Zhixun eats some fruit

457
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:19,567
By the way, did Zhixun serve in the military?

458
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,267
Yes, I am a retired soldier in the army.

459
00:28:24,267 --> 00:28:26,333
Yeah

460
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:30,000
I don't know if you've heard

461
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:31,800
I used to be... Dad

462
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:33,233
I've already said

463
00:28:33,233 --> 00:28:35,633
You have served our country for over thirty years.

464
00:28:35,633 --> 00:28:36,933
I've said that.

465
00:28:36,933 --> 00:28:40,033
So where did you serve in the military and what was your job?

466
00:28:40,033 --> 00:28:44,067
I served in Pyongyang.

467
00:28:44,067 --> 00:28:47,500
In the north... Driving a tank and fighting bravely

468
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:00,067
Zhixun is so humorous

469
00:29:05,367 --> 00:29:08,200
Actually said Pyongyang

470
00:29:08,200 --> 00:29:09,867
Stop laughing

471
00:29:11,567 --> 00:29:13,400
I didn't laugh

472
00:29:16,233 --> 00:29:17,200
Wait and see

473
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:21,467
I won't let you go even if you make a small mistake in the future.

474
00:29:21,467 --> 00:29:23,067
Is this a minor mistake?

475
00:29:23,067 --> 00:29:26,000
You made a statement that would shake up the national security.

476
00:29:26,000 --> 00:29:27,400
Hello

477
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,767
Okay

478
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,400
knew

479
00:29:31,100 --> 00:29:32,667
Pyongyang…

480
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:36,267
Hello

481
00:29:36,267 --> 00:29:38,067
Choi Yuri, what's wrong with you?

482
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:42,033
Stop crying and talk nicely

483
00:29:42,033 --> 00:29:45,000
Have you been drinking? Where are you now?

484
00:29:47,467 --> 00:29:49,133
Hello Choi Yuri

485
00:29:49,133 --> 00:29:51,033
My best friend

486
00:29:51,033 --> 00:29:53,567
Oh, the puppy is here too.

487
00:29:55,433 --> 00:29:56,333
Puppy?

488
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:59,000
"Wherever Kim Ji-eun goes, I go"

489
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:02,033
"Jingle, Jingle"

490
00:30:02,033 --> 00:30:05,367
"Jingle Bells for Puppies"

491
00:30:08,700 --> 00:30:10,133
Hey, are you crazy?

492
00:30:10,133 --> 00:30:13,433
You can't even drink one glass.

493
00:30:13,433 --> 00:30:15,167
How much did she drink?

494
00:30:15,167 --> 00:30:17,500
She can't even drink a glass of soju.

495
00:30:18,300 --> 00:30:21,167
No refunds if the bottle is opened.

496
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,533
What?

497
00:30:25,533 --> 00:30:27,000
Looks delicious

498
00:30:30,233 --> 00:30:32,567
Really delicious

499
00:30:32,567 --> 00:30:34,733
Mr. Puppy, come have a drink.

500
00:30:34,733 --> 00:30:36,567
Enough

501
00:30:36,567 --> 00:30:38,267
What happened

502
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,600
Online novel writer who writes romantic stories

503
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:45,833
I've never been in love.

504
00:30:46,567 --> 00:30:47,800
Feeling a bit desolate

505
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:49,500
This is the real you.

506
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,400
Why should I be sad about this?

507
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,867
You're talking so loudly

508
00:30:53,867 --> 00:30:56,100
Mr. Puppy, why are you dating him?

509
00:30:56,100 --> 00:30:57,700
No, why don't you break up?

510
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:58,933
He's a boy now.

511
00:30:58,933 --> 00:31:01,233
Hey, keep your voice down.

512
00:31:02,233 --> 00:31:06,133
Someone's girlfriend turned into a boy and they are still dating

513
00:31:06,133 --> 00:31:09,100
Life is so unfair

514
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:12,233
How about someone telling you something?

515
00:31:12,233 --> 00:31:15,000
Being single since birth has become a modern trend

516
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:18,167
You are not forced into this life, you choose it yourself

517
00:31:18,167 --> 00:31:19,400
Be more rational and confident

518
00:31:20,367 --> 00:31:21,700
Right, Yun Jae

519
00:31:22,633 --> 00:31:23,533
oh

520
00:31:23,533 --> 00:31:25,267
Yeah

521
00:31:26,833 --> 00:31:28,300
Being single is not a sin

522
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:31,800
There's no need to be sad about this and drink to drown your sorrows

523
00:31:32,867 --> 00:31:33,900
Right, Yun Jae

524
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,467
Yeah

525
00:31:38,667 --> 00:31:40,633
Why are you asking him?

526
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,500
And I had a blind date today

527
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:47,067
Oh my god, is this true?

528
00:31:47,067 --> 00:31:48,567
Why are you saying this now?

529
00:31:49,167 --> 00:31:50,633
Who introduced whom?

530
00:31:50,633 --> 00:31:53,967
Sister Mina is my sister who writes online novels with me

531
00:31:54,533 --> 00:31:55,467
so what

532
00:31:55,467 --> 00:31:56,500
How?

533
00:32:06,733 --> 00:32:07,733
elder brother

534
00:32:16,700 --> 00:32:17,867
Ms. Choi Yu-ri?

535
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:19,700
Who are you

536
00:32:19,700 --> 00:32:23,533
Mina introduced me. My name is Yang Songyuan.

537
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:57,967
Please

538
00:33:04,833 --> 00:33:09,167
He looks very old but he says he is only 41

539
00:33:09,767 --> 00:33:10,867
That's ridiculous.

540
00:33:10,867 --> 00:33:14,033
He also said that after marriage he would live with his parents or even grandparents.

541
00:33:15,333 --> 00:33:17,000
What a harmonious

542
00:33:18,967 --> 00:33:20,967
You know what's funnier?

543
00:33:20,967 --> 00:33:23,100
This isn't the first time

544
00:33:23,100 --> 00:33:25,267
A 44-year-old single man who has been married three times

545
00:33:25,267 --> 00:33:26,933
23-year-old handsome man with credit bankruptcy

546
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:29,233
A pastor who lives on his six sisters

547
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,500
I am a Buddhist

548
00:33:34,033 --> 00:33:35,233
Hello

549
00:33:35,233 --> 00:33:37,067
Am I that bad?

550
00:33:37,067 --> 00:33:38,333
puppy

551
00:33:38,333 --> 00:33:39,900
Am I really that bad?

552
00:33:41,367 --> 00:33:44,900
No, I think you are very professional and handsome.

553
00:33:47,433 --> 00:33:48,700
Not pretty, right?

554
00:33:49,367 --> 00:33:51,333
Oh yeah…

555
00:33:51,333 --> 00:33:52,467
What

556
00:34:21,067 --> 00:34:23,133
(Sister Mina)
Yuri, how was your blind date today?

557
00:34:23,133 --> 00:34:25,067
(Sister Mina)
I heard you left early because of an emergency.

558
00:34:25,067 --> 00:34:27,667
(Sister Mina)
My efforts were in vain.

559
00:34:27,667 --> 00:34:30,433
(Sister Mina)
Oh, remember, my birthday is this weekend.

560
00:34:30,433 --> 00:34:33,067
(Sister Mina)
I will invite my brother to come and dress nicely.

561
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:38,500
toilet paper…

562
00:34:43,667 --> 00:34:45,033
I'll do it myself

563
00:34:46,667 --> 00:34:48,033
good

564
00:34:48,033 --> 00:34:49,300
Do you want to go to the restroom?

565
00:34:49,967 --> 00:34:51,300
It sprayed here too.

566
00:34:51,833 --> 00:34:54,700
I know, but it's better if you wipe it yourself.

567
00:35:19,233 --> 00:35:20,633
I really can't stand it

568
00:36:30,200 --> 00:36:35,167
Zhien, since you've become a man, why don't you just be my boyfriend?

569
00:36:35,933 --> 00:36:38,500
Hey, you don't look drunk. Do you want to get off and walk by yourself?

570
00:36:40,567 --> 00:36:43,533
Don't let me get drunk

571
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:45,600
Then stop talking nonsense and do your best

572
00:36:45,600 --> 00:36:46,833
Very tired

573
00:36:46,833 --> 00:36:48,233
I'm not talking nonsense

574
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:53,033
I'll treat you better than a puppy.

575
00:36:53,033 --> 00:36:54,533
I will love you more

576
00:36:54,533 --> 00:36:56,600
Keep your hands dry

577
00:36:57,533 --> 00:36:59,733
I can love you like this

578
00:37:00,933 --> 00:37:04,867
No matter what you look like

579
00:37:04,867 --> 00:37:07,567
I can love you

580
00:37:07,567 --> 00:37:10,067
Thank you for saying that, my dear sister.

581
00:37:10,067 --> 00:37:12,733
Wait until I become a girl again

582
00:37:12,733 --> 00:37:14,633
And I have to be Yun Jae's girlfriend

583
00:37:20,333 --> 00:37:22,000
Right, Yun Jae

584
00:37:25,700 --> 00:37:27,000
Um

585
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,767
So heavy

586
00:37:36,767 --> 00:37:38,633
What did you eat?

587
00:37:58,267 --> 00:37:59,200
(The Night of the Universe)

588
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,267
(The Night of the Universe)
Saturn's largest moon, Titan

589
00:38:02,267 --> 00:38:07,067
is moving away from Saturn faster than Earth's moon

590
00:38:07,067 --> 00:38:12,733
According to the observations of the Saturn probe Cassini,

591
00:38:12,733 --> 00:38:18,233
Titan is moving away from Saturn at a rate of 11 centimeters per year.

592
00:38:18,233 --> 00:38:20,500
The Earth's Moon is...

593
00:38:47,933 --> 00:38:52,433
Zhien, since you've become a man, why don't you just be my boyfriend?

594
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:55,967
I'll treat you better than a puppy.

595
00:38:55,967 --> 00:38:57,467
I will love you more

596
00:38:57,467 --> 00:38:59,300
Keep your hands dry

597
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:01,167
I can love you like this

598
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:08,533
Are you up?

599
00:39:08,533 --> 00:39:09,800
What

600
00:39:11,167 --> 00:39:13,700
Well, go get ready. I made Xinqi fried rice.

601
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,967
Um

602
00:39:21,633 --> 00:39:24,267
Jin Zhien's strength has not diminished

603
00:39:24,267 --> 00:39:25,533
Delicious, huh?

604
00:39:29,567 --> 00:39:31,733
(Sister: Where are you spending the night?)
It's Sister Zhihui

605
00:39:31,733 --> 00:39:33,167
She asked where you were spending the night.

606
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:35,733
Can you see it?

607
00:39:36,633 --> 00:39:38,567
My eyesight is 1.5 1.2

608
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,533
So why wear glasses?

609
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:43,033
Don't you always wear glasses?

610
00:39:43,033 --> 00:39:47,100
It's just an image accessory

611
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:48,500
Image accessories?

612
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:53,867
You crazy person

613
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,900
But why don't you write?

614
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,033
Didn’t you say that writing is the happiest thing?

615
00:40:18,533 --> 00:40:20,033
What to write now

616
00:40:20,933 --> 00:40:22,433
Not everyone can write

617
00:40:29,367 --> 00:40:30,833
Why don't you watch the end?

618
00:40:30,833 --> 00:40:35,133
Let's go. No consolation prize.

619
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:37,100
Aren't there also awards for excellence and championship?

620
00:40:37,967 --> 00:40:39,533
Let's eat spicy rice cakes

621
00:40:40,133 --> 00:40:45,633
But there is such a legitimate way to skip class

622
00:40:45,633 --> 00:40:47,300
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

623
00:40:48,033 --> 00:40:49,567
marvelous

624
00:40:49,567 --> 00:40:51,700
You can also see the handsome college brother

625
00:40:52,167 --> 00:40:53,933
Take me with you from now on.

626
00:40:54,700 --> 00:40:58,833
I will also follow the path of a literary girl in the future

627
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:03,367
People who sleep in literature class

628
00:41:03,367 --> 00:41:04,867
What kind of literary girl should I be?

629
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:14,500
Hello

630
00:41:14,500 --> 00:41:16,167
I am Choi Yu-ri

631
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,133
What

632
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,233
who

633
00:41:24,867 --> 00:41:26,867
Say you won the championship

634
00:41:27,767 --> 00:41:28,800
What

635
00:41:29,067 --> 00:41:31,033
(34th Fuming University College Paper Competition)

636
00:41:33,033 --> 00:41:35,800
Hey, you have to thank me

637
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:37,567
If you hadn't come with me to participate in the writing competition

638
00:41:37,567 --> 00:41:39,467
There would be no fame and money now.

639
00:41:39,467 --> 00:41:40,633
There will be no deadline.

640
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:43,200
That is true

641
00:41:45,833 --> 00:41:46,800
Kim Ji-eun

642
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,333
Ask you

643
00:41:50,333 --> 00:41:54,200
The most popular comments on my online novels always come from the same person

644
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:56,100
I occasionally...

645
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:58,267
No, I often read his messages.

646
00:41:58,267 --> 00:41:59,633
Correct the direction of my story

647
00:42:01,233 --> 00:42:03,767
Sometimes he would help me figure out where the episode would end.

648
00:42:05,333 --> 00:42:06,233
Yeah

649
00:42:07,467 --> 00:42:08,467
I see

650
00:42:09,433 --> 00:42:11,000
You are very talented, Kim Ji-eun

651
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:52,933
(TO Zhien)

652
00:42:56,967 --> 00:42:58,233
(A person who loves to eat meat)

653
00:42:58,233 --> 00:43:00,767
(Sea Sausage Angel)

654
00:43:08,800 --> 00:43:10,933
(Sea Sausage Angel)

655
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:17,000
Thank you, Zhien

656
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,267
What the hell is Choi Yu-ri?

657
00:43:19,767 --> 00:43:21,933
No wonder you always miss your deadlines.

658
00:43:27,167 --> 00:43:28,767
You are very talented, Kim Ji-eun

659
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:00,433
Honey

660
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:04,167
I've kept you waiting for a long time.

661
00:44:12,933 --> 00:44:13,800
Yunzai

662
00:44:25,633 --> 00:44:26,633
Zhixun is here

663
00:44:34,367 --> 00:44:36,833
Bro, I really miss you.

664
00:44:36,833 --> 00:44:37,767
Let's go

665
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,000
Come with me

666
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:47,800
But in order to cheer up Yuri

667
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:48,800
Will you need him?

668
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:51,867
Yuri likes cute types

669
00:44:51,867 --> 00:44:55,333
So I wonder if Min Hyuk can be her boyfriend for a day today

670
00:44:55,967 --> 00:44:57,600
I look a little cute

671
00:44:58,400 --> 00:44:59,900
But that sister is not my type

672
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,033
Why is Yuri not okay?

673
00:45:03,033 --> 00:45:06,433
Otherwise, Brother Zhixun, you can just be the one

674
00:45:06,433 --> 00:45:08,067
There is no boy like me

675
00:45:08,067 --> 00:45:09,767
So suitable to be Prince Charming

676
00:45:09,767 --> 00:45:11,200
Prince Charming?

677
00:45:12,033 --> 00:45:14,100
People think Prince Charming

678
00:45:14,100 --> 00:45:17,600
He appeared to save the unfortunate princess.

679
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:19,667
But it’s not

680
00:45:19,667 --> 00:45:23,800
He appeared to piss off the witch who had brought the princess into misfortune.

681
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:34,133
Look

682
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:37,267
Who in the world would not envy

683
00:45:37,267 --> 00:45:38,867
A princess with a man like you

684
00:45:40,333 --> 00:45:42,333
The witch will be so angry that she will tremble

685
00:45:47,833 --> 00:45:49,000
Can I be

686
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,600
Why bother asking Yun Jae about this?

687
00:45:53,767 --> 00:45:55,967
If you're not happy, I won't do it.

688
00:45:59,033 --> 00:46:00,667
She is your friend

689
00:46:00,667 --> 00:46:02,000
Of course I have to help her get revenge.

690
00:46:24,933 --> 00:46:25,800
Really good

691
00:46:26,900 --> 00:46:28,500
What's so good

692
00:46:29,267 --> 00:46:31,667
Like fresh sea bream in season

693
00:46:32,367 --> 00:46:34,767
Shiny and attractive

694
00:46:35,900 --> 00:46:37,233
Look in the mirror

695
00:46:39,467 --> 00:46:40,967
hateful

696
00:46:47,767 --> 00:46:49,233
Give me

697
00:46:49,233 --> 00:46:50,500
What are you doing?

698
00:46:50,500 --> 00:46:51,733
Don't move

699
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,733
Sorry I called you a snapper

700
00:47:01,867 --> 00:47:02,933
Jin Zhihui

701
00:47:03,700 --> 00:47:05,667
Open your eyes and look at me

702
00:47:05,667 --> 00:47:07,233
Don't call my name

703
00:47:08,233 --> 00:47:10,367
What's wrong? What are you going to do?

704
00:47:12,100 --> 00:47:13,733
Am I really that handsome?

705
00:47:19,067 --> 00:47:22,433
"To my dear Mina"

706
00:47:22,433 --> 00:47:25,333
"Happy birthday to you"

707
00:47:30,133 --> 00:47:33,467
Thank you all happy birthday

708
00:47:34,933 --> 00:47:35,800
cheers

709
00:47:36,533 --> 00:47:38,833
Cheers

710
00:47:40,700 --> 00:47:41,967
Thank you for coming

711
00:47:41,967 --> 00:47:43,500
Happy birthday Happy birthday

712
00:47:45,767 --> 00:47:48,267
Happy birthday to you, Sister Mina

713
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:51,000
Who is Mina?

714
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:54,333
Everyone knows

715
00:47:54,333 --> 00:47:56,167
She is my beloved sister.

716
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:58,367
She won the popularity award this time.

717
00:47:58,367 --> 00:48:00,700
The Private Life of the Goddess by Glass Slipper Writer

718
00:48:00,700 --> 00:48:02,200
Glass Slipper Writer?

719
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,900
Is that her?

720
00:48:03,900 --> 00:48:05,300
She is a faceless writer

721
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:06,633
Did I say something wrong?

722
00:48:08,067 --> 00:48:10,500
I'd say she's a goddess.

723
00:48:11,167 --> 00:48:12,333
Right

724
00:48:15,833 --> 00:48:16,867
Mina

725
00:48:16,867 --> 00:48:17,767
elder brother

726
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:19,400
Thank you for coming

727
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:20,933
Happy birthday to you, Mina

728
00:48:20,933 --> 00:48:22,300
Thanks

729
00:48:23,233 --> 00:48:24,800
Hello, Ms. Yuri

730
00:48:25,500 --> 00:48:27,100
Hello

731
00:48:27,100 --> 00:48:29,033
I was stuck in traffic on the way here.

732
00:48:29,033 --> 00:48:30,733
So a little late

733
00:48:31,800 --> 00:48:33,833
But why are you here?

734
00:48:35,867 --> 00:48:37,400
Didn't you read the message?

735
00:48:37,400 --> 00:48:39,333
I told you he would come.

736
00:48:41,633 --> 00:48:43,800
He said he's interested in you

737
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:45,633
You should take this opportunity to get married.

738
00:48:45,633 --> 00:48:47,733
Children should be born young so that they will be smart

739
00:48:50,067 --> 00:48:51,433
You guys go and have a chat

740
00:48:53,967 --> 00:48:55,433
Let's avoid it.

741
00:48:57,033 --> 00:48:58,233
Miss Yuli

742
00:48:58,233 --> 00:49:02,867
There is a delicious mutton hotpot restaurant nearby.

743
00:49:02,867 --> 00:49:05,633
I'll treat you to a big meal today.

744
00:49:05,633 --> 00:49:07,300
No, it's okay.

745
00:49:07,300 --> 00:49:08,400
No

746
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:10,300
After eating mutton hotpot

747
00:49:10,300 --> 00:49:12,900
There are also good wine bars nearby

748
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:14,733
Don't feel burdened

749
00:49:14,733 --> 00:49:17,100
I... it's mutton hotpot

750
00:49:17,100 --> 00:49:18,967
It's really okay to have mutton hotpot

751
00:49:26,433 --> 00:49:27,333
Yuli

752
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:30,533
Hello...

753
00:49:32,033 --> 00:49:34,100
You told me you had a date

754
00:49:34,100 --> 00:49:36,167
Who are you meeting dressed so beautifully?

755
00:49:39,067 --> 00:49:40,233
So handsome

756
00:49:41,567 --> 00:49:42,967
What's going on?

757
00:49:45,967 --> 00:49:47,767
Hello God

758
00:49:50,567 --> 00:49:51,600
she is…

759
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:55,000
She is Sister Mina

760
00:49:55,000 --> 00:49:57,367
The one I mentioned last time

761
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,200
The author of "Obstetrics and Gynecology for Dummies"?

762
00:50:00,200 --> 00:50:01,933
right

763
00:50:01,933 --> 00:50:03,100
I am your fan

764
00:50:04,233 --> 00:50:05,633
What?

765
00:50:06,500 --> 00:50:08,533
Oh my god, that's it.

766
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:13,200
who is he

767
00:50:13,200 --> 00:50:14,733
He is my friend

768
00:50:14,733 --> 00:50:16,367
My name is Jin Zhixun

769
00:50:16,367 --> 00:50:18,133
Kim Ji-hoon

770
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,767
I'm Yuri's boyfriend

771
00:50:30,733 --> 00:50:32,433
Boyfriend?

772
00:50:32,433 --> 00:50:33,933
Didn't Yuri say that?

773
00:50:36,100 --> 00:50:38,067
This is the first time I've heard of it

774
00:50:38,067 --> 00:50:38,933
It’s not like that…

775
00:50:38,933 --> 00:50:39,967
Choi Yu-ri

776
00:50:41,133 --> 00:50:42,833
I'm sad that you're like this

777
00:50:44,067 --> 00:50:48,033
Do you still socialize with people even though you have a boyfriend?

778
00:50:48,033 --> 00:50:50,500
No, it's not like that...

779
00:50:53,800 --> 00:50:58,200
I didn't know she was that kind of person.

780
00:50:58,200 --> 00:50:59,533
hateful

781
00:51:01,200 --> 00:51:02,300
elder brother

782
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:05,867
Hello

783
00:51:05,867 --> 00:51:08,367
You seem to have misunderstood something.

784
00:51:08,367 --> 00:51:09,867
He is not my boyfriend

785
00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:10,600
that…

786
00:51:10,600 --> 00:51:12,400
I'm not her boyfriend yet.

787
00:51:13,967 --> 00:51:15,833
I have a crush on her

788
00:51:19,700 --> 00:51:21,100
Secret love? Secret love

789
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,867
Do you have a crush on Yuri?

790
00:51:23,867 --> 00:51:25,333
right

791
00:51:25,333 --> 00:51:26,667
I've had a crush on her for ten years.

792
00:51:30,033 --> 00:51:32,867
Hey, you can't drink much, why drink red wine?

793
00:51:34,200 --> 00:51:36,067
There's something stuck in my hair

794
00:51:39,467 --> 00:51:41,233
And the skirt is a bit short today

795
00:51:41,233 --> 00:51:42,467
Where is it short?

796
00:51:42,467 --> 00:51:44,433
Mina's skirt is shorter

797
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:08,900
I miss you so much

798
00:52:11,167 --> 00:52:12,833
I miss you so much

799
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:21,000
Is he doing well?

800
00:53:03,133 --> 00:53:04,933
You ask me why I like her?

801
00:53:06,733 --> 00:53:09,433
There's no reason to like them all.

802
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,867
Big eyes hidden behind glasses

803
00:53:14,867 --> 00:53:18,000
And the strength hidden behind humility

804
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:22,400
There is also a cute but unconcealable femininity

805
00:53:25,767 --> 00:53:28,533
You look like you're reciting lines.

806
00:53:28,533 --> 00:53:32,867
Could it be that Yuri asked you to act in the play?

807
00:53:32,867 --> 00:53:35,267
It wasn't you who ordered it, was it?

808
00:53:35,267 --> 00:53:37,900
Well-known online novel writer is indeed worthy of his reputation

809
00:53:37,900 --> 00:53:39,800
Imagination is really rich

810
00:53:40,667 --> 00:53:44,467
But I finally understand why Yuri is more popular than you.

811
00:53:44,467 --> 00:53:45,300
What

812
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:47,933
Romance novels are naturally based on the emotional line

813
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:50,533
But you only seem to love conspiracy theories

814
00:53:50,533 --> 00:53:53,133
I don't quite understand feelings.

815
00:53:57,800 --> 00:53:59,367
otherwise

816
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,967
See the way she looks at me

817
00:54:04,967 --> 00:54:08,733
Just say something like "I won't act in a play, I'll give orders"

818
00:54:12,433 --> 00:54:15,433
I really love Choi Yu-ri

819
00:54:26,733 --> 00:54:29,767
If possible, can I take Yuri with me?

820
00:54:33,733 --> 00:54:34,767
good

821
00:54:34,767 --> 00:54:37,233
Whatever you want

822
00:54:37,233 --> 00:54:38,500
Thanks

823
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:39,867
Let's go

824
00:54:47,433 --> 00:54:48,833
So handsome

825
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:53,533
I'm betting ten years of my life as a writer

826
00:54:54,767 --> 00:54:56,867
He is definitely not Choi Yu-ri's boyfriend

827
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:01,233
He said he was Kim Ji-hoon from Yanxi University

828
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,833
Hello

829
00:55:09,833 --> 00:55:12,600
You can't thank me enough, why are you still so rude?

830
00:55:12,600 --> 00:55:14,667
Who asked you to do this?

831
00:55:14,667 --> 00:55:16,067
What is this kind of thing?

832
00:55:16,067 --> 00:55:18,500
I'm just taking revenge on her in the name of justice for you.

833
00:55:18,500 --> 00:55:20,567
Didn't you see that Sister Mina was so angry that she started cursing?

834
00:55:20,567 --> 00:55:24,533
So why are you taking revenge for me?

835
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,733
Do you even look down on me like this?

836
00:55:28,733 --> 00:55:30,400
Hello Choi Yuri

837
00:55:31,633 --> 00:55:32,567
You're exaggerating.

838
00:55:32,567 --> 00:55:34,733
I've never been in love in my life

839
00:55:34,733 --> 00:55:35,900
If I fall in love with you

840
00:55:35,900 --> 00:55:38,400
What would you do if I confessed to you?

841
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,100
Look at it

842
00:55:45,100 --> 00:55:47,200
You hesitated too

843
00:55:47,967 --> 00:55:50,600
I didn't think that much.

844
00:55:52,500 --> 00:55:53,500
I was too careless.

845
00:55:53,500 --> 00:55:55,433
You should consider this.

846
00:55:55,433 --> 00:56:00,300
You don't know how cautious I am.

847
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:02,233
I'm afraid I'll fall in love with you.

848
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:06,233
As long as I'm with you

849
00:56:06,233 --> 00:56:09,300
I will forget what I look like now

850
00:56:10,333 --> 00:56:11,433
sorry

851
00:56:11,433 --> 00:56:13,067
No, don't apologize.

852
00:56:13,067 --> 00:56:15,533
Why are you apologizing? How have you wronged me?

853
00:56:18,300 --> 00:56:20,733
You're doing this for my own good.

854
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:26,567
I don't know why I'm so angry.

855
00:56:26,567 --> 00:56:28,133
But I'm just angry

856
00:56:33,900 --> 00:56:36,167
Let's separate today

857
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:39,100
I'll call you tomorrow

858
00:56:59,867 --> 00:57:01,167
How am I

859
00:57:01,167 --> 00:57:02,633
Very beautiful

860
00:57:03,833 --> 00:57:04,733
What

861
00:57:04,733 --> 00:57:06,467
I said you are beautiful

862
00:57:11,233 --> 00:57:14,967
If I had known you would say that, I would have come earlier.

863
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,400
that…

864
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,500
I mistook you for someone else when you walked in just now

865
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:28,433
Is it the same now?

866
00:57:29,833 --> 00:57:31,600
What

867
00:57:31,600 --> 00:57:34,967
Are you mistaking me for someone else now?

868
00:57:36,267 --> 00:57:39,033
No, that's not the case.

869
00:57:39,033 --> 00:57:41,067
That's enough

870
00:57:41,067 --> 00:57:42,933
What is enough?

871
00:57:42,933 --> 00:57:44,833
You recognized me

872
00:57:44,833 --> 00:57:48,600
The look in his eyes was the same as when I first walked in.

873
00:58:08,667 --> 00:58:13,600
"Unbelievably familiar"

874
00:58:15,900 --> 00:58:20,900
"The same memory still throbs."

875
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:28,100
"Through the Sunset"

876
00:58:29,633 --> 00:58:35,700
"The light called Yours illuminates my heart"

877
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:40,700
"I'll see you"

878
00:58:40,700 --> 00:58:45,233
"Always I know more than I see"

879
00:58:45,233 --> 00:58:47,133
"It's not a dream"

880
00:58:47,133 --> 00:58:51,733
"You become more vivid"

881
00:58:51,733 --> 00:58:55,400
"I'll hear you"

882
00:58:55,400 --> 00:58:59,700
"Eyes don't lie Oh it's you"

883
00:58:59,700 --> 00:59:04,000
"Please remember my promise to you"

884
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:06,567
"At any moment"

885
00:59:06,567 --> 00:59:09,400
(Postscript)

886
00:59:09,400 --> 00:59:10,500
(When I was young)

887
00:59:33,633 --> 00:59:36,933
We are like a quarreling couple

888
00:59:38,467 --> 00:59:39,733
Why

889
00:59:39,733 --> 00:59:41,667
How can you feel that way?

890
00:59:41,667 --> 00:59:43,867
Is it because I have a bad expression?

891
00:59:43,867 --> 00:59:45,000
Do you want to reshoot?

892
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,767
no

893
00:59:46,767 --> 00:59:50,433
Because other couples

894
00:59:50,433 --> 00:59:54,833
They will get very close and hold hands to take pictures

895
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:00,600
sorry

896
01:00:00,600 --> 01:00:04,033
Because it's my first time doing this

897
01:00:05,100 --> 01:00:07,800
What's there to stutter about?

898
01:00:17,533 --> 01:00:20,333
I'll just grab you like this

899
01:00:38,300 --> 01:00:40,967
(Thanks to Park Myung-shin and Ye-won for their special appearance)

900
01:01:10,533 --> 01:01:14,833
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

901
01:01:14,833 --> 01:01:17,667
It's all because of you that I stayed up all night last night

902
01:01:17,667 --> 01:01:19,433
Bro, have you broken up with your girlfriend?

903
01:01:19,433 --> 01:01:21,433
Everyone says he is the deer boy from Yanxi University

904
01:01:21,433 --> 01:01:23,033
He's very handsome, right?

905
01:01:23,033 --> 01:01:25,067
The boyfriend of the author of Glass Slippers

906
01:01:25,067 --> 01:01:27,333
My dear, you are here

907
01:01:27,333 --> 01:01:30,233
Kiss...

908
01:01:30,233 --> 01:01:32,200
Everyone is talking about Kim Ji-hoon

909
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:34,767
You two are serious about each other, right?

910
01:01:34,767 --> 01:01:35,400
Um

911
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:36,567
Park Yun-jae, where are you?

912
01:01:36,567 --> 01:01:37,167
What

913
01:01:37,167 --> 01:01:38,933
Did you say motel?

914
01:01:38,933 --> 01:01:40,233
Is he cheating?

915
01:01:40,233 --> 01:01:42,633
Zhixun, why are you here?
