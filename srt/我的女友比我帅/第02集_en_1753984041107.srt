(Chuu)

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,100
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

6
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:42,367
Because the princess is so beautiful

7
00:00:42,367 --> 00:00:46,567
A witch blinded by jealousy

8
00:00:46,567 --> 00:00:51,900
Use magic to turn the princess into a prince

9
00:00:53,233 --> 00:00:55,067
If the Supreme Wisdom and the Supreme Grace

10
00:00:55,067 --> 00:00:57,833
One day you suddenly bang

11
00:00:57,833 --> 00:01:00,567
What would it be like to become a boy?

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,733
I think it's great

13
00:01:02,733 --> 00:01:06,267
You will become stronger and taller

14
00:01:06,267 --> 00:01:10,533
I don't want a boy and I can't wear a dress

15
00:01:10,533 --> 00:01:14,400
You mean the man next to dad?

16
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,700
Is it mom?

17
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:16,867
Um

18
00:01:16,867 --> 00:01:21,800
My parents seem to have become weird after watching too much TV.

19
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,467
This is maternal inheritance

20
00:01:23,467 --> 00:01:26,533
Maybe she'll become a man, maybe she won't.

21
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:29,100
Just letting you know first

22
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:30,167
How to say it

23
00:01:30,167 --> 00:01:32,700
Yeah, it's like a family trait.

24
00:01:32,700 --> 00:01:36,133
I'm so glad it's not cancer or diabetes.

25
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:42,500
Is this something to be thankful for?

26
00:01:45,033 --> 00:01:46,767
So cute

27
00:01:47,267 --> 00:01:48,633
Right

28
00:01:51,433 --> 00:01:53,900
Can you still laugh?

29
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:56,233
Look at this beer belly

30
00:02:01,633 --> 00:02:02,767
Why is she doing that?

31
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:06,900
What's going on?

32
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:08,133
What's the matter with you coming to see me so late?

33
00:02:08,133 --> 00:02:10,100
Let's try it

Cheat Bar

35
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:42,933
Didn't she see it?

36
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,467
Probably didn't see it

37
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:03,533
Very good. I pretended not to see it and acted very naturally.

38
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,833
but…

39
00:04:07,833 --> 00:04:12,433
They still want to kiss me in this situation...

40
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:14,967
fine

41
00:04:14,967 --> 00:04:17,900
I'm coming to have a drink today too.

42
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,267
No matter how you look at it, he's a man.

(Episode 2 Eye Games)

44
00:05:36,533 --> 00:05:38,267
Why am I so nervous?

45
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,433
Okay, but I don't have to say it today.

46
00:05:41,433 --> 00:05:42,600
next time…

47
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:43,867
Let's talk about it next time

48
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,300
Wait, classmates

49
00:05:48,267 --> 00:05:50,067
It's mom

50
00:05:51,933 --> 00:05:54,300
Are you here to get a haircut?

51
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,733
Come in

52
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:58,767
We also have many young customers in our store

53
00:05:58,767 --> 00:06:01,800
I also cut my daughter's hair.

54
00:06:04,933 --> 00:06:06,367
good

55
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,700
Because I see a lot of guests

56
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,400
Honey, I've finished blow-drying my hair, you can finish it.

57
00:06:14,467 --> 00:06:16,367
It's Dad

58
00:06:16,367 --> 00:06:18,500
Are you here to get a haircut? Come in.

59
00:06:19,067 --> 00:06:21,267
Can I get you a glass of plum juice?

60
00:06:25,533 --> 00:06:27,567
I'll come again next time

61
00:06:47,667 --> 00:06:49,133
Wait where are you going?

62
00:06:49,133 --> 00:06:51,900
I don't know, it's too hot.

Go wipe your table.

Oh, by the way, Yun Jae

104
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:27,167
How about we ask the boss to install that in the store?

105
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:29,067
Which

106
00:09:29,067 --> 00:09:30,967
Is that called Kissok?

107
00:09:30,967 --> 00:09:32,333
Or Kiosk

108
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,767
What's that called?

109
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:35,700
Is it Kissok or Kiosk?

110
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:39,800
It's the machine for ordering food.

111
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:42,200
Kiss, stop talking.

112
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,900
Kiss…

113
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,033
Kiss…

114

115
00:09:49,533 --> 00:09:51,767
Kissok

116
00:09:52,567 --> 00:09:56,167
Kissok…

117
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:58,300
It should be Kiosk

118
00:09:58,300 --> 00:10:00,267
Kissok… Hello

119
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:03,200
It's not Kissok, it's Kiosk.

120
00:10:06,367 --> 00:10:08,433
Yes, it is Kissok

121
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:12,633
No, I mean Kiosk

122
00:10:12,633 --> 00:10:14,267
It's okay if I said something wrong, why get angry?

123
00:10:14,267 --> 00:10:16,600
I didn't get angry, you little brat.

124
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:20,400
Is it because there are no customers in the store and you still want to install a food ordering machine?

125
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:22,533
I'm so dumbfounded

126
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,467
Why did it suddenly become so hot?

127
00:10:27,133 --> 00:10:28,567
I'll go out for some fresh air and come back

128
00:10:44,567 --> 00:10:45,800
This is new.

129
00:10:51,133 --> 00:10:52,333

130
00:10:54,900 --> 00:10:56,200

The birthday party is over

135
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:26,133
I'm too late

136
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:28,233
Happy birthday

137
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,800
I can explain it. You open the door first.

138
00:11:44,767 --> 00:11:46,667
What's going on? Am I drunk?

139
00:11:47,167 --> 00:11:49,267
That's impossible! I haven't even opened the wine yet.

140
00:11:50,967 --> 00:11:54,700
That perfect man outside the door

141
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,100
what is going on

142
00:11:57,467 --> 00:11:59,100
Calm down Choi Yuri

143
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,267
Yuli

144
00:12:00,967 --> 00:12:02,733
He even knows my name.

145
00:12:05,800 --> 00:12:07,933
Wait, wouldn't it be...

146
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,167
President

147
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,667
Are you just going to take a look today?

148
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,433
I won't approach her rashly.

149
00:12:24,367 --> 00:12:27,900
She shows up here at the same time every day

150
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:29,967
And I will order a snack set for four people

151
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,233
The rich second generation always observes me silently from a distance

152
00:12:35,233 --> 00:12:37,100
Are you finally going to confess?

153
00:12:41,167 --> 00:12:42,267
Or...

154
00:12:43,633 --> 00:12:45,233
Really handsome

155
00:12:45,233 --> 00:12:49,367
"Cigarettes can burn but meat cannot be burnt" your naughty confession

156
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,300
Today, I was shaken again

157
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,867
Are you an old fan who was deeply moved by my novel?

159
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,600
Wake up, please.

160
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:10,433
Is there anything I can help you with?

161
00:13:11,433 --> 00:13:13,233
Why did you suddenly change your clothes?

162
00:13:14,767 --> 00:13:16,167
Are you still wearing makeup?

163
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,100
I'm not wearing any makeup and this is my daily outfit

164
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,800
Your eyelashes fell off

165
00:13:33,967 --> 00:13:36,867
The pain of creation is so terrible

166
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:41,933
I know what you're expecting

167
00:13:41,933 --> 00:13:43,367
But it's not what you think

168
00:13:44,633 --> 00:13:47,200
Look, the sea sausage is coming!

169
00:13:47,733 --> 00:13:48,733
What

170
00:13:49,333 --> 00:13:51,900
Sea...sea sausage?

171
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:56,800
The code that proves our fifteen-year friendship

172
00:13:57,733 --> 00:14:00,367
Sea sausage

173
00:14:08,433 --> 00:14:09,567
So disgusting

174
00:14:09,567 --> 00:14:10,933
So magical

175
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,000
Is it magical?

176
00:14:14,067 --> 00:14:15,233
Is this sea sausage?

177
00:14:15,233 --> 00:14:18,100
My dad said it was cute.

178
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:22,433
So disgusting

179
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:25,467
I am a bald sea cucumber

180
00:14:25,867 --> 00:14:27,333
Twist and turn

181
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:28,533
Don't use me

182
00:14:28,533 --> 00:14:30,300

184
00:14:31,633 --> 00:14:36,100
Sea sausage... Sea sausage...

185
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:39,733
Our approach to taking center stage

186
00:14:39,733 --> 00:14:41,133
There seems to be only one

187
00:14:44,567 --> 00:14:45,667
Sea sausage

188
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:04,433
Sea sausage…

189
00:15:07,867 --> 00:15:10,700
Please stop jumping like this.

190
00:15:11,867 --> 00:15:13,733
Don't jump the sea cucumber

191
00:15:15,333 --> 00:15:18,000
(Our memory questions)

192
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:29,633
The name of the sauna that Kim Ji-eun and Choi Yu-ri went to together

193
00:15:29,633 --> 00:15:30,800
The Fairy and the Woodcutter

194
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,233
The Fairy and the Woodcutter?

195
00:15:35,967 --> 00:15:38,100
Choi Yu-ri's First Love

196
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:39,867
My first-year junior high school tutor, Gu Jae-hee

197
00:15:39,867 --> 00:15:42,000
Now married with three children

198
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,333
Goo Jae Hee…

199
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:51,233
Passed, thank you

200
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,067
Yeah, just watch it.

201
00:16:10,067 --> 00:16:11,567
Take a good look

202
00:16:11,567 --> 00:16:13,867
My sister did the same thing as you.

203
00:16:14,433 --> 00:16:16,933
I feel like I'm watching a pumpkin carriage

204
00:16:16,933 --> 00:16:18,367
It's really amazing

205
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:20,500
Can I touch it?

206
00:16:20,500 --> 00:16:21,967
What are you touching?

207
00:16:22,867 --> 00:16:24,467
Go get a glass of water.

208
00:16:24,467 --> 00:16:25,867
Is water good?

209
00:16:27,167 --> 00:16:28,567
I remember it was in the fourth grade.

210
00:16:28,567 --> 00:16:32,200
One day you suddenly said that you might become a man at any time

211
00:16:32,767 --> 00:16:35,600
I thought you were crazy.

212
00:16:38,567 --> 00:16:40,667
If you hadn't laid the groundwork first

213
00:16:40,667 --> 00:16:42,800
I might have a hard time accepting this now.

214
00:16:46,867 --> 00:16:48,533
How should I survive?

215
00:16:48,533 --> 00:16:51,167
You must think it's ridiculous.

216
00:16:51,167 --> 00:16:53,500
But this is definitely not a loss

217
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:57,633
After all, this appearance can be exchanged for social kindness and can also enjoy all kinds of preferential treatment

218
00:16:57,633 --> 00:16:58,900
Just look at me and you'll know.

219
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:02,333
I'm becoming more friendly now.

220
00:17:08,967 --> 00:17:10,567
Can't go to school

221
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:14,167
There's no way to find a job

222
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:17,733
Most importantly…

223
00:17:18,867 --> 00:17:20,000
Yunzai

224
00:17:23,567 --> 00:17:27,500
I'm afraid Yun Jae will break up with me.

225
00:17:30,767 --> 00:17:32,733
If he breaks up with you

226
00:17:33,900 --> 00:17:35,700
Just date me, I'll take responsibility.

227
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,900
Are you okay?

228
00:17:41,800 --> 00:17:43,633
I'm Ji Eun, okay? Kim Ji Eun

229
00:17:43,633 --> 00:17:46,200
No, absolutely not.

230
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,200
You can't tell me, can't you?

231
00:17:48,867 --> 00:17:50,000
You are crazy

232
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,033
No...

233
00:17:55,933 --> 00:17:57,633
Although I am a friend

234
00:17:58,133 --> 00:17:59,867
But it's so handsome

235
00:18:02,067 --> 00:18:05,267
So handsome, so miserable

236
00:18:11,033 --> 00:18:13,533
It's really amazing. Aren't you tired?

237
00:18:17,367 --> 00:18:20,267
Yun Jae, didn't we turn off the lights in the cafe?

238
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,333
What nonsense is it that all the stores will be closed after they are packed up?

239
00:18:22,333 --> 00:18:24,267
But the lights are on now.

240
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:33,600
Are you okay, Madam Boss?

241
00:18:35,633 --> 00:18:37,267
Did the blind date go wrong?

242
00:18:39,100 --> 00:18:40,367
That's right

243
00:18:41,167 --> 00:18:42,433
Not going well?

244
00:18:54,067 --> 00:18:55,800
Excuse me, is this Miss Sadako?

245
00:18:56,300 --> 00:18:58,333
Sorry, it's my first time here.

246
00:18:58,333 --> 00:18:59,700
Slightly wrong way

247
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:02,467
It's okay, it's inevitable.

248
00:19:06,667 --> 00:19:08,233
Scare me

249
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,567
Nice to meet you

250
00:19:11,233 --> 00:19:15,000
You are indeed a beauty as Yunzai said.

251
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,200
So that's it

252
00:19:19,233 --> 00:19:22,567
You're tall, just like he said.

253
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,700
It may also be a potential stock.

254
00:19:31,700 --> 00:19:34,000
Yes, I will transform him.

255
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,400
For a man who has to go back to school at 9 o'clock

256
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,733
I even removed my hair.

257
00:19:39,733 --> 00:19:41,000
It's a good thing to work hard

258
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,533
And he's really tall.

259
00:19:42,533 --> 00:19:45,367
Working hard... only made me taller.

260
00:19:46,967 --> 00:19:48,833
Should I fire that part-time student?

261
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,300
Can I leave the boss lady in the store by herself?

262
00:19:59,300 --> 00:20:01,600
Even if we go in, we may not be able to comfort her.

263
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:02,633
Let's go

264
00:20:04,900 --> 00:20:06,467
Let's continue the stall.

265
00:20:06,467 --> 00:20:08,133
Didn't you say you would treat me to fruit sweet tea?

266
00:20:09,633 --> 00:20:11,167
It's too late

267
00:20:11,167 --> 00:20:12,367
Let's go next time

268
00:20:13,267 --> 00:20:17,200
Fruit sweet tea...

269
00:20:22,033 --> 00:20:24,833
If I treat you, can you kiss me once?

270
00:20:27,667 --> 00:20:29,433
Buy me a house, I'll consider it.

271
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:32,667
If I kissed you first

272
00:20:33,733 --> 00:20:35,667
It feels easier to break through yourself

273
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:37,033
calm…

274
00:20:39,667 --> 00:20:41,200
Just close your eyes

275
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,567
The plug-in you mentioned

276
00:20:42,567 --> 00:20:44,767
I also want to use one to help me

277
00:20:45,667 --> 00:20:47,100
Are you going to help me buy a house?

278
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:49,000
I want a 33-ping house facing north and south

279
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,700
It's a two-minute walk from Gangnam Station.

280
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,733
No, 45 pings to 60 pings

281
00:20:52,733 --> 00:20:54,100
Let Me Go, Yun Jae

282
00:20:54,100 --> 00:20:55,867
I really want to curse

283
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,667
I still can't kiss a man

284
00:21:01,667 --> 00:21:04,800
This is what I should say, right?

285
00:21:22,633 --> 00:21:25,333
(My Great Grace)

286
00:21:27,833 --> 00:21:30,200
I can't answer the phone

287
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,467
Hear his voice

288
00:21:32,467 --> 00:21:34,433
I might break up

289
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,833
(Can you come out for a moment?)

290
00:22:00,033 --> 00:22:02,033
I can't call him.

291
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:04,733
When I see that face, I feel like breaking up

292
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,800
He is clearly my greatest benefactor.

293
00:22:09,967 --> 00:22:11,767
But it's not my grace

294
00:22:12,767 --> 00:22:15,300
It's obviously not my greatest favor

295
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:18,933
But it seems like it's really her

296
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,500
(My Great Grace)

297
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,200
Good Night Yun Jae

298
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:33,000
Whether it's the universe or love

299
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:36,433
I really don't understand

300
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:51,067
(Did my Yun Jae eat? What did he eat?)

301
00:22:54,633 --> 00:22:56,467
Can we meet tomorrow?

302
00:22:56,467 --> 00:22:58,000
I'll go to your house

303
00:23:12,767 --> 00:23:13,967
Hello

304
00:23:13,967 --> 00:23:16,833
I think I ate too much sashimi in Busan.

305
00:23:16,833 --> 00:23:18,367
Stomach discomfort

306
00:23:18,367 --> 00:23:20,867
Do you want to order some spicy rice cakes?

307
00:23:25,633 --> 00:23:27,467
What are you doing?

308
00:23:27,467 --> 00:23:28,967
Have you slept yet?

309
00:23:32,367 --> 00:23:33,800
Are you crying?

310
00:23:34,933 --> 00:23:37,467
No, just a runny nose

311
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:38,833
Go out

312
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:43,567
Why is it just the gender that changed?

313
00:23:43,567 --> 00:23:45,833
The working style is still the same as Jin Zhien

314
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,900
If it's too serious, take medicine and don't push yourself

315
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:27,633
I'm sorry for last night

316
00:24:27,633 --> 00:24:30,200
I shouldn't have been so reckless.

317
00:24:31,267 --> 00:24:32,967
You don't have to apologize

318
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:36,200
You may not see me the same way

319
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,200
But I haven't changed for you

320
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,833
It's normal for this to happen between couples.

321
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:50,700
I've thought about it

322
00:24:54,833 --> 00:24:57,900
Also try to understand with your mind

323
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:03,400
But your appearance as a boy

324
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,733
Makes me a little confused

325
00:25:05,733 --> 00:25:07,367
To be honest

326
00:25:09,233 --> 00:25:11,867
It's difficult to maintain previous relationships

327
00:25:11,867 --> 00:25:13,200
Yunzai

328
00:25:15,500 --> 00:25:17,133
I've thought about it too.

329
00:25:18,533 --> 00:25:21,067
How about we just be friends for a while?

330
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:24,167
Friend?

331
00:25:24,167 --> 00:25:25,967
To friends

332
00:25:27,333 --> 00:25:30,300
Before I became a girl again

333
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,200
Let's be friends first

334
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,333
What's going on?

335
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:40,567
This development is too sudden.

336
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:45,767
Don't boys usually come to places like this to play video games together?

337
00:25:47,367 --> 00:25:49,367
You adapt too quickly.

338
00:25:49,367 --> 00:25:51,033
I'm a quick adaptor.

339
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:56,100
But have you played this game?

340
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,433
This is super difficult.

341
00:25:57,433 --> 00:26:00,233
Yeah, I used to play with my sister.

342
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:01,533
My account is...

343
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:06,867
Found it

344
00:26:22,133 --> 00:26:24,233
I'm here, get in the car.

345
00:26:24,233 --> 00:26:25,433
Wait a moment

346
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:27,967
Someone shot me with a gun

347
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:34,133
I'm hanging up

348
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:35,400
Died again?

349
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,033
Park Yun-jae, how many times do you have to die in one round?

350
00:26:38,033 --> 00:26:39,900
Wait for me, I'll save you

351
00:26:42,933 --> 00:26:44,233
I died again

352
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:46,233
What

353
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:47,567
Wait and see

354
00:26:47,567 --> 00:26:49,500
Look, I'll kill them all.

355
00:26:57,433 --> 00:26:58,300
"Can't stop"

356
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:00,400
"Can't stop thinking about you"

357
00:27:06,167 --> 00:27:07,433
"Can't stop"

358
00:27:07,433 --> 00:27:09,867
"Can't stop thinking about you"

359
00:27:11,633 --> 00:27:13,400
You don't have to send me back.

360
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:16,933
I also want to take you home.

361
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:24,500
A few things left

362
00:27:24,500 --> 00:27:26,600
What are you talking about

363
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:29,100
After you become my friend

364
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,433
There seems to be a lot of things I want to do

365
00:27:32,367 --> 00:27:34,700
Of course a lot.

366
00:27:34,700 --> 00:27:38,800
My favorite thing is playing with you

367
00:27:50,833 --> 00:27:56,200
I love playing with you the most

368
00:28:05,733 --> 00:28:07,367
Then you go in.

369
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:10,600
Um

370
00:28:12,200 --> 00:28:13,833
good

371
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:18,000
Call me if you have any questions.

372
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:19,433
good

373
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,500
That's right

374
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:32,033

00:41:06,033 --> 00:41:07,033
The third move

561
00:41:08,467 --> 00:41:10,733
Any physical contact

562
00:41:10,733 --> 00:41:13,267
And send gentle eyes

563
00:41:16,033 --> 00:41:16,867
Then like this

564
00:41:17,767 --> 00:41:19,433
"Would you like to tell me?"

565
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,167
"Will you express your throbbing feelings?"

566
00:41:25,533 --> 00:41:29,767
"I always laugh for no reason."

567
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:30,867
Looks so delicious

568
00:41:32,433 --> 00:41:33,400
I will enjoy it

569
00:41:35,300 --> 00:41:38,033
"Can you hear my heartbeat?"

570
00:41:38,033 --> 00:41:40,233
"Leaping towards you"

571
00:41:43,833 --> 00:41:44,700
Do your eyes hurt?

572
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:47,100
What

573
00:41:47,933 --> 00:41:48,467
No

574
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:49,967
I see you blinking.

575
00:41:50,867 --> 00:41:51,767
Eat quickly

576
00:41:52,867 --> 00:41:53,767
good

577
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,700
"Cause I love you I'm curious about you"

578
00:41:59,667 --> 00:42:02,667
"Just looking at you"

579
00:42:03,733 --> 00:42:04,500
The last resort

580
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:08,600
The ultimate trick with nonsensical lines

581
00:42:09,267 --> 00:42:12,200
"My heart is losing control"

582
00:42:13,667 --> 00:42:16,433
"This feeling and throbbing"

583
00:42:16,433 --> 00:42:18,933
"Everything is beautiful"

584
00:42:21,133 --> 00:42:22,233
It's already 10 o'clock

585
00:42:22,233 --> 00:42:23,400
I have to go now

586
00:42:24,233 --> 00:42:25,967
What so fast?

587
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:31,300
Since it has become like this

588
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,333
It's late

589
00:42:35,367 --> 00:42:36,500
Do you want to stay here for one night?

590
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:38,833
My sister isn't here anyway.

591
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:46,067
If I want to live outside, I have to ask for permission first.

592
00:42:46,067 --> 00:42:47,833
The whole family is without exception

593
00:42:47,833 --> 00:42:49,500
If you tell me that day, you're dead.

594
00:42:50,967 --> 00:42:51,633
Too

595
00:42:53,100 --> 00:42:55,400
Preserving one's life is more important than living outside

596
00:43:10,733 --> 00:43:12,333
I'm almost driven crazy by Jin Zhien

597
00:43:12,933 --> 00:43:15,267
What route did she take today?

598
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,333
Can't

599
00:43:25,233 --> 00:43:27,200
What happened to scare me?

600
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:28,267
What happened

601
00:43:28,267 --> 00:43:29,600
Seung-hoon has a girlfriend

602
00:43:31,033 --> 00:43:32,967
He said he couldn't go to the social tonight.

603
00:43:32,967 --> 00:43:34,033
I need to find someone else.

604
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:38,000
Then just find someone to go.

605
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,233
Don't you have any boys you know?

606
00:43:40,567 --> 00:43:41,633
are you going

607
00:43:41,633 --> 00:43:43,333
You look quite cute

608
00:43:43,333 --> 00:43:45,400
As long as I help you dress up, you should be able to hold on.

609
00:43:46,767 --> 00:43:48,200
Although I look cute

610
00:43:48,800 --> 00:43:49,933
But I won't go

611
00:43:49,933 --> 00:43:51,200
And I have a girlfriend.

612
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,200
Are there any good people around you?

613
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,800
Please

614
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,033
Friends or relatives of the cat owner next door are also fine

615
00:43:57,033 --> 00:43:59,600
I already said I would bring a handsome guy with me.

616
00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:01,867
Yun Jae, please

617
00:44:01,867 --> 00:44:03,733
What's wrong with you? Help me

618
00:44:03,733 --> 00:44:04,900
What saved you

619
00:44:06,467 --> 00:44:08,233
Clean your windows so you can go home quickly

620
00:44:22,700 --> 00:44:23,600
Welcome

621
00:44:25,967 --> 00:44:26,767
Yunzai

622
00:44:28,400 --> 00:44:29,700
How come you come

623
00:44:30,867 --> 00:44:31,467
that…

624
00:44:31,467 --> 00:44:33,467
Yun Jae, do you know him?

625
00:44:33,467 --> 00:44:34,733
To him is my...

626
00:44:37,333 --> 00:44:38,167
friend

627
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:40,433
friend…

628
00:44:40,433 --> 00:44:44,133
Hello, I'm Yunjae's best friend.

629
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:46,233
My name is Lee Min Hyuk

630
00:44:46,233 --> 00:44:47,867
I've mentioned him before, right?

631
00:44:47,867 --> 00:44:49,300
My younger brother who works with me

632
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:52,700
Hi, I'm a friend of Yun Jae's from the same school...

633
00:44:53,233 --> 00:44:54,800
Saved

634
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,967
Bro, do you have a girlfriend?

635
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,333
No that...

636
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:03,767
Could you help me just once?

637
00:45:06,633 --> 00:45:07,700
What to help

638
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:08,667
Reject him

639
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:16,500
I shouldn't be sorry.

640
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,167
There's nothing we can do.

641
00:45:20,133 --> 00:45:23,467
Yun Jae, just spare an hour today.

642
00:45:23,467 --> 00:45:24,333
Me?

643
00:45:26,267 --> 00:45:27,267
Just say I won't go

644
00:45:27,267 --> 00:45:29,167
Isn't Han Ji-min your ideal type?

645
00:45:29,167 --> 00:45:31,433
One of them looks exactly like Han Ji-min

646
00:45:35,467 --> 00:45:37,233
It turns out your ideal type is not Zhien

647
00:45:37,867 --> 00:45:39,200
It's Ji-min

648
00:45:40,567 --> 00:45:42,667
no…

649
00:45:42,667 --> 00:45:43,833
He is talking nonsense

650
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:45,267
He said he saw her TV series when he was six years old

651
00:45:45,267 --> 00:45:47,767
I remember Han Ji-min was beautiful from that time.

652
00:45:50,333 --> 00:45:52,333
Did you know she was beautiful at the age of six?

653
00:45:54,633 --> 00:45:55,967
I also thought the unicorn was beautiful at that time

654
00:45:55,967 --> 00:45:56,900
Stag beetles are also

655
00:45:56,900 --> 00:45:58,733
And mantis

656
00:45:58,733 --> 00:46:00,167
Even cockroaches

657
00:46:04,200 --> 00:46:05,533
that

658
00:46:05,533 --> 00:46:06,900
I'll go to the social with you.

659
00:46:07,833 --> 00:46:09,067
I'll go in Yun-jae's place.

660
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:12,600
Really

661
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:14,300
Bro, is this true?

662
00:46:14,300 --> 00:46:15,533
Just go for an hour.

663
00:46:15,533 --> 00:46:16,000
right

664
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,500
Thank you so much, brother.

665
00:46:17,500 --> 00:46:18,967
I'll give you my number now

666
00:46:18,967 --> 00:46:20,233
Upload the location to you right away

667
00:46:28,267 --> 00:46:29,200
Cockroaches?

668
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,233
I promised him I would stay for an hour and then leave.

669
00:46:37,233 --> 00:46:39,400
Actually, it doesn't have to be like that.

670
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,800
If I don't go, you will go. What else can I do?

671
00:46:41,800 --> 00:46:42,967
I don't want that.

672
00:46:45,067 --> 00:46:46,300
You should...

673
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:48,033
Not in a bad mood, right?

674
00:46:48,867 --> 00:46:49,733
Me?

675
00:46:51,200 --> 00:46:52,867
Not at all

676
00:46:52,867 --> 00:46:54,200
Go to the appointment happily

677
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,067
Be sure to ask Min Hyuk to treat you to something delicious

678
00:46:56,933 --> 00:46:58,433
You are so refreshing

679
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:02,767
After all, it's a girls-to-girls social.

680
00:47:03,367 --> 00:47:03,967
Big Brother

681
00:47:04,833 --> 00:47:06,800
I'll call you when Yun Jae Min Hyuk arrives.

682
00:47:11,800 --> 00:47:12,667
Let's go

683
00:47:33,933 --> 00:47:36,400
I really sit for an hour and then leave

684
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,700
Brother, don't be so harsh.

685
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,367
This time I'm not kidding.

686
00:47:40,367 --> 00:47:41,967
It's ten past six

687
00:47:42,867 --> 00:47:44,467
I leave at 7:10

688
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:50,267
Feeding rate

689
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:52,900
We've arrived a long time ago

690
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:56,267
Brother, I found a super handsome big brother

691
00:48:00,367 --> 00:48:01,367
What

692
00:48:02,567 --> 00:48:04,167
(Owl Villa)

693
00:48:04,167 --> 00:48:07,033
Min Hyuk seemed upset after being stood up today.

694
00:48:07,633 --> 00:48:09,367
He asked me to have a drink with him.

695
00:48:10,267 --> 00:48:11,167
Okay?

696
00:48:12,267 --> 00:48:14,300
Of course you can.

697
00:48:15,100 --> 00:48:16,033
good

698
00:48:17,300 --> 00:48:18,867
Call me when you're done

699
00:48:18,867 --> 00:48:20,500
You can also choose not to fight. Fight if you want.

700
00:48:21,733 --> 00:48:22,667
goodbye

701
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:35,067
It's so hot

702
00:48:39,067 --> 00:48:42,000
My cheeks get hot whenever I drink alcohol

703
00:48:42,733 --> 00:48:44,600
I become cold when I drink

704
00:48:50,567 --> 00:48:51,533
Come here for a moment

705
00:49:30,167 --> 00:49:31,733
Serve you two spicy chicken soup with beef intestines

706
00:49:33,500 --> 00:49:34,433
It must be delicious

707
00:49:36,433 --> 00:49:37,467
Eat more, brother.

708
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,167
for you

709
00:49:50,867 --> 00:49:52,067
It's really delicious

710
00:49:54,600 --> 00:49:58,200
I said there are so many delicious chicken and soups here

711
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:00,300
So you like non-mainstream things?

712
00:50:01,767 --> 00:50:03,300
How do you know?

713
00:50:03,300 --> 00:50:04,967
I'm like this

714
00:50:04,967 --> 00:50:08,700
I prefer sea cucumber to sashimi when I go to a sashimi restaurant.

715
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:10,467
I like the fish cake in spicy rice cake to be bigger than rice cake

716
00:50:10,467 --> 00:50:12,400
Even TV dramas prefer male and female second

717
00:50:15,700 --> 00:50:17,700
Brother, the more you watch, the more interesting it becomes.

718
00:50:19,167 --> 00:50:19,967
Cheers

719
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:35,500
Big Brother

720
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,400
Don't you think this is really inappropriate?

721
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:41,000
Even if there are any difficulties

722
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:43,933
Cancelling the date on the same day is too much.

723
00:50:43,933 --> 00:50:46,200
I bought this dress specially

724
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:48,367
I went to the hair salon this morning.

725
00:50:51,333 --> 00:50:55,667
Don't waste your feelings on someone who doesn't cherish the promise you made to him

726
00:50:55,667 --> 00:50:58,133
If you are not so familiar

727
00:50:58,133 --> 00:50:59,567
That's even more unnecessary.

728
00:51:01,133 --> 00:51:02,333
Around you...

729
00:51:02,333 --> 00:51:05,933
There will definitely be more people who cherish you

730
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:11,467
It's the first time

731
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:13,467
What

732
00:51:13,467 --> 00:51:17,933
This is the first time someone comforted me seriously like an adult.

733
00:51:17,933 --> 00:51:20,533
Can I speak more casually?

734
00:51:22,833 --> 00:51:25,133
Yeah, okay

735
00:51:25,133 --> 00:51:28,133
But brother is so handsome

736
00:51:28,133 --> 00:51:29,367
Such a good figure

737
00:51:29,367 --> 00:51:31,033
How come you don't have a girlfriend?

738
00:51:33,733 --> 00:51:36,100
I'm dating someone.

739
00:51:36,100 --> 00:51:37,933
I knew it was like this

740
00:51:37,933 --> 00:51:39,400
Do you have any photos?

741
00:51:39,400 --> 00:51:40,833
Wait a minute.

742
00:51:44,333 --> 00:51:46,133
Can't show him.

743
00:51:48,633 --> 00:51:51,533
I'm going to the dressing room.

744
00:52:01,133 --> 00:52:03,300
This is the girls' dressing room.

745
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,900
sorry

746
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:11,900
(The boys' dressing room is on the 3rd floor)

747
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:31,133
Bro, why are you so slow?

748
00:52:34,767 --> 00:52:36,600
Why do you look so bad?

749
00:52:37,367 --> 00:52:38,933
What happened?

750
00:52:58,500 --> 00:52:59,800
What

751
00:52:59,800 --> 00:53:01,133
You said where is he?

752
00:53:01,867 --> 00:53:04,167
You wait for me

753
00:53:04,167 --> 00:53:05,467
Brother, I beg you for the last time

754
00:53:05,467 --> 00:53:07,500
Please help me take this to Zhixun.

755
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,367
Ignoring me again

756
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:14,033
So annoying

757
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:20,200
Got it

758
00:53:21,967 --> 00:53:23,367
Cool

759
00:53:32,833 --> 00:53:34,667
Wait a minute

760
00:53:45,300 --> 00:53:46,567
Hello

761
00:53:46,567 --> 00:53:47,367
You kid

762
00:53:47,367 --> 00:53:49,200
What are you doing

763
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,533
Where is Zhien?

764
00:53:56,133 --> 00:53:58,767
What on earth did you imagine?

765
00:53:58,767 --> 00:54:01,267
I'm really hurt

766
00:54:01,267 --> 00:54:04,267
So why did you force him to drink?

767
00:54:04,267 --> 00:54:06,100
He went to the dressing room.

768
00:54:06,100 --> 00:54:08,667
Just drink until you're drunk

769
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:19,233
Anyway, I will take Zhien back

770
00:54:19,233 --> 00:54:21,500
Just take a good rest

771
00:54:21,500 --> 00:54:23,067
Let him sleep here today.

772
00:54:23,067 --> 00:54:25,233
They're all men, so what?

773
00:54:25,233 --> 00:54:27,067
Whether boys or girls

774
00:54:27,067 --> 00:54:28,833
Of course I have to go home to sleep

775
00:54:32,267 --> 00:54:35,733
Brother, you can't carry him alone.

776
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:37,367
Taxi driver and security guard

777
00:54:37,367 --> 00:54:39,400
The three of us finally moved up here

778
00:54:40,133 --> 00:54:43,500
Can I compare with you?

779
00:54:43,500 --> 00:54:47,067
Don't you know I've been working out recently?

780
00:54:55,167 --> 00:54:56,567
Bro, are you asleep?

781
00:54:56,567 --> 00:54:57,900
Yeah, I'm asleep.

782
00:55:01,433 --> 00:55:04,267
Zhixun seems to value you very much

783
00:55:08,367 --> 00:55:10,767
Why do you suddenly say that?

784
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:13,933
After he got drunk

785
00:55:13,933 --> 00:55:17,067
Call your name almost once a minute

786
00:55:17,967 --> 00:55:21,967
"Yun Jae..."

787
00:55:21,967 --> 00:55:23,400
Calling like this

788
00:55:24,133 --> 00:55:26,133
Say sorry to you

789
00:55:26,133 --> 00:55:28,033
Say thank you

790
00:55:29,567 --> 00:55:31,200
Say I love you again

791
00:55:32,200 --> 00:55:33,533
Yeah

792
00:55:34,600 --> 00:55:38,633
Usually guys find this disgusting.

793
00:55:38,633 --> 00:55:41,400
It's strange that Zhixun doesn't

794
00:55:42,700 --> 00:55:45,167
Although today is the first day I met Zhixun

795
00:55:45,167 --> 00:55:47,667
But I feel like he's a very gentle and kind person.

796
00:55:49,167 --> 00:55:50,600
Right

797
00:55:54,633 --> 00:55:55,867
Go to sleep

798
00:55:55,867 --> 00:55:57,267
I'm going to sleep

799
00:56:48,233 --> 00:56:50,500
What should my brother do?

800
00:57:57,633 --> 00:58:00,567
(Postscript)

801
00:58:03,733 --> 00:58:05,467
You know...

802
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:08,833
Why have I never been dumped by a guy?

803
00:58:13,333 --> 00:58:15,467
You know the game of "Reading the Mood"?

804
00:58:15,467 --> 00:58:19,300
A game where you win by speaking out before others

805
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:22,233
Do you think Yun Jae will dump me?

806
00:58:23,133 --> 00:58:25,300
So you want me to break up first?

807
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,967
Can you survive without Yunzai?

808
00:58:30,400 --> 00:58:31,867
That's why you have to strike first.

809
00:58:31,867 --> 00:58:33,467
Just suggest being friends

810
00:58:34,033 --> 00:58:38,833
Although if Yun Jae breaks up with me, we will become strangers forever

811
00:58:38,833 --> 00:58:41,433
But if you suggest going back to being friends

812
00:58:41,433 --> 00:58:43,833
We can still be friends

813
00:58:48,367 --> 00:58:49,667
Yunzai

814
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:53,500
I've considered it.

815
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:56,467
What if we just go back to being friends for a while?

816
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:58,500
Friend?

817
00:58:58,500 --> 00:59:00,200
Yeah, friend

818
00:59:04,800 --> 00:59:07,267
Before I turned back into a girl

819
00:59:08,300 --> 00:59:10,267
Let's be friends first

820
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:03,900
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

821
01:00:03,900 --> 01:00:05,900
Becoming a girl again

822
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:08,067
Why don't you tell your parents the truth?

823
01:00:08,067 --> 01:00:11,200
Anyway, I won't say anything since it's back.

824
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:14,333
Have you ever dated a 30-something guy who's out of touch with the world?

825
01:00:14,333 --> 01:00:15,067
It's you, right?

826
01:00:15,067 --> 01:00:16,333
My partner Jin Zhihui

827
01:00:16,333 --> 01:00:17,500
Do you miss me?

828
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,400
There's a vixen next to me

829
01:00:19,400 --> 01:00:21,833
There's absolutely no way I can trust your boyfriend.

830
01:00:21,833 --> 01:00:24,567
No way, it's my first love.

831
01:00:24,567 --> 01:00:25,833
is that so

832
01:00:25,833 --> 01:00:28,400
My heart is very fragile, please be gentle

833
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:29,567
Nightclub?

834
01:00:29,567 --> 01:00:31,367
It's really crossed the line.
