2
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,270
Make me coffee, Oppa.

3
00:01:01,270 --> 00:01:04,610
A hot Americano with two extra shots.

4
00:01:05,410 --> 00:01:07,970
I don't want to go to sleep tonight.

5
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:13,500
I'm Park Yunjae's girlfriend.

6
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,000
I'm temporarily like this, but I will return to being a girl soon.

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,170
So, could you please stop acting out?

8
00:01:19,170 --> 00:01:21,820
Yunjae said he told you many times that he has a girlfriend.

9
00:01:21,820 --> 00:01:23,870
That's me.

10
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,810
Don't you get it at this point?

11
00:01:25,810 --> 00:01:29,330
It's me! I'm Park Yunjae's girlfriend!

12
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:04,220
It's all a mess.

13
00:02:04,220 --> 00:02:06,280
Everything is a mess.

14
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,690
Everything's a mess.

15
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,710
You're the biggest mess!

16
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:12,730
Are you getting rashes on your face?

17
00:02:12,730 --> 00:02:15,600
I'm just worried.

18
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,020
Must be nice to live a life without worries.

19
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:20,520
Your face is just beaming.

20
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:25,410
Oppa, hi.

21
00:02:28,540 --> 00:02:30,340
Hey.

22
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,870
I stayed up all night, thanks to you.

23
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:37,800
But I'm not tired at all.

24
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,250
Huh?

25
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:42,030
Whoa.

26
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,540
You nailed the coffee.

27
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:52,180
- Sure.
- Whoa.

28
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:55,210
You really shouldn't say "Whoa" to a customer.

29
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:57,100
Give me a latte.

30
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:00,500
Did you sleep well, Oppa?

31
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,400
What's going on here?

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,060
Did you two...

33
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,000
Don't even go there.

34
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,300
You said you didn't sleep. You still want more?

35
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,680
What's with you?

36
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:20,160
Yesterday, you told me I was pretty.

37
00:03:22,030 --> 00:03:25,140
- That's...
- You came here yesterday, too?

38
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:26,850
Something is definitely going on.

39
00:03:26,850 --> 00:03:28,430
Hyeong, did you break up with your girlfriend?

40
00:03:28,430 --> 00:03:31,160
I'm exactly the same as I was yesterday.

41
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:34,370
But I must not be pretty today.

42
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:45,600
- Minju.
- Yes?

43
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:48,920
I haven't been able to share something with you

44
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,700
due to some circumstances...

45
00:03:51,700 --> 00:03:53,400
About what?

46
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:57,110
I have a girlfriend.

47
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:04,150
Oppa, are you kidding?

48
00:04:04,150 --> 00:04:06,330
You've always been clear about that.

49
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:08,950
That you have a girlfriend.

50
00:04:08,950 --> 00:04:11,270
I did tell you that,

51
00:04:11,270 --> 00:04:15,090
but I don't think I told you in all seriousness.

52
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,190
Seems like you're in the danger zone now.

53
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:20,240
What?

54
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:23,040
You're not drawing a line with me,

55
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,530
but for yourself.

56
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,340
Look at this.

57
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:46,770
Huh? This is Jihun and I.

58
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,210
What is this situation?

59
00:04:49,210 --> 00:04:52,610
Someone posted this on the Yeonhui University online forum last night.

60
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:55,600
People have been reposting it everywhere.

61
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,840
I am totally flabbergasted.

62
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:02,210
I understand that Jihun stands out.

63
00:05:02,210 --> 00:05:05,070
- But this much?
- Yes.

64
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:09,890
You and I are blurred out.

65
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:14,850
How could they post a random person's photo like this?

66
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:17,800
Let's help.

67
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:20,630
- How?
- It's simple.

68
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:24,720
Just point out the identity and coordinates.

69
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:30,140
You can do that, no problem.

70
00:05:59,710 --> 00:06:02,360
Did you answer all the questions?

71
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:05,980
I did, but I probably got them wrong.

72
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:08,020
Let's see.

73
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:21,200
Yuna, look at the textbook, not my face.

74
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:24,860
Your face is prettier than the book.

75
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:26,920
Thanks, Yuna.

76
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:30,980
But at this rate, we won't make enough progress before the midterms.

77
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:34,470
How much progress have you made with my brother?

78
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:38,240
- What?
- I know everything.

79
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:42,000
About your relationship with my brother.

80
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,580
Really?

81
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:46,220
Yunjae told you everything?

82
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:48,680
I could just tell.

83
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:52,670
Well, it's quite hard to explain.

84
00:06:52,670 --> 00:06:57,250
Don't worry. I'll keep your secret.

85
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:02,100
Although you have a tough road ahead of you.

86
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:04,970
I'll cheer you two on.

87
00:07:04,970 --> 00:07:07,040
Good luck.

88
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,420
Okay.

89
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,870
Good luck.

90
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:25,500
You should have thought about it.

91
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:31,540
You... You don't realize how hard I'm trying not to have feelings for you, do you?

92
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Why is everything such a mess?

93
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,960
I brought some tteokbokki.

94
00:07:49,060 --> 00:07:52,650
That was such a satisfying meal, wasn't it?

95
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:55,530
Can you hand me a tissue?

96
00:07:59,250 --> 00:08:02,670
Hey, how long will you act like this?

97
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:05,560
You know you haven't said a single word today?

98
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:10,910
Gosh, you cutie.

99
00:08:10,910 --> 00:08:14,820
Stop! You're banned from doing this from now on.

100
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:25,140
"While Kim Jieun is living as a man,

101
00:08:25,140 --> 00:08:29,650
the two parties agree to observe the following rules."

102
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:32,780
Keep reading.

103
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:36,070
"First, Kim Jieun will not appear

104
00:08:36,070 --> 00:08:38,620
in front of Choi Yuri, like they're in a scene of a graphic novel."

105
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:41,670
I'm late, aren't I? Happy birthday.

106
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:43,770
Yuri!

107
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:46,350
"Secondly, whenever and wherever Choi Yuri wants,

108
00:08:46,350 --> 00:08:48,750
Kim Jieun will do the penis fish dance."

109
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:50,260
Penis fish!

110
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,470
Stop it!

111
00:08:53,470 --> 00:08:54,580
Stop!

112
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:56,250
- "Thirdly,
- Hey.

113
00:08:56,250 --> 00:09:00,060
Kim Jieun will not physically touch Choi Yuri while she is a man."

114
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:02,020
You're warm.

115
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:04,360
"Fourth,

116
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:08,000
Choi Yuri will not fall for Kim Jieun."

117
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:13,100
You don't realize how hard I'm trying not to have feelings for you, do you?

118
00:09:18,390 --> 00:09:21,000
I guess it was really tough for you.

119
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:27,990
I crossed the line yesterday.

120
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:31,240
I'm the one who crossed the line. Sorry.

121
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:34,460
No, I'm more sorry.

122
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,500
Why is she not picking up?

123
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,430
Wow, Jihun is now the 7th most popular post on Night Fan.

124
00:09:59,430 --> 00:10:00,940
What?

125
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,780
I can't believe it.

126
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:08,560
He's a regular person. Why?

127
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:10,760
Kang Dongwon was a regular person,

128
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:13,570
and so was Chalamet.

129
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,930
The world is so obsessed with looks.

130
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,370
I brought tteokbokki.

131
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:31,280
Come in.

132
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:42,990
Should I have brought something else?

133
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:46,120
No, I've been craving tteokbokki.

134
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:48,380
- And?
- It's just a lot.

135
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:51,280
Oh, I thought your sister would be here.

136
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,210
She must be busy these days.

137
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,310
She's often late.

138
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:01,330
Did you open the link I sent you?

139
00:11:01,330 --> 00:11:03,880
The Yeonhui University's "Doe-eyed Hottie" post?

140
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,940
It was hilarious.

141
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:08,740
- Are you okay?
- It's not like I'm a celebrity.

142
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,530
I'm sure it'll die down soon.

143
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,270
It's okay.

144
00:11:13,270 --> 00:11:14,980
Right?

145
00:11:14,980 --> 00:11:18,320
Of course, it will be.

146
00:11:20,520 --> 00:11:22,420
Yunjae.

147
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,880
Yeah?

148
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:26,800
Yesterday...

149
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,600
- Nothing happened, right?
- Yesterday?

150
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:34,480
No. Not really.

151
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:36,750
Not really?

152
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:41,050
I worked a shift... and went home to sleep.

153
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:44,010
I sent you a text. Didn't you see it?

154
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,580
Of course, I saw it.

155
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:48,930
How you and that vixen were looking at each other so affectionately.

156
00:11:51,860 --> 00:11:54,990
Do I have something on my face?

157
00:11:54,990 --> 00:11:57,010
No.

158
00:11:57,010 --> 00:12:00,800
I just realized the tteokbokki is too much.

159
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:02,530
I'm getting heartburn.

160
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:04,630
You are?

161
00:12:04,630 --> 00:12:07,550
- Want me to buy medicine?
- It's not that bad.

162
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:12,010
I need to rest.

163
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:16,250
Oh, okay.

164
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:17,960
Sure.

165
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:23,600
Tteokbokki is her favorite.

166
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,900
What is she mad about?

167
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,800
Hey! Kim Jieun! Hey! Have you seen this?

168
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,870
Yeonhui University's doe-eyed hottie.

169
00:12:53,870 --> 00:12:55,210
Many people have seen him,

170
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:59,240
but his identity has not been revealed.

171
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:01,580
According to a trustworthy source,

172
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:07,400
the doe-eyed hottie is the illegitimate son of a conglomerate.

173
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:10,930
According to Close Friend A, he is an idol trainee.

174
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:13,970
An entertainer, serving the top 10% of Gangnam rich ladies,

175
00:13:13,970 --> 00:13:15,920
known to be very popular.

176
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,990
Please do it like this.

177
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:21,920
Oh, just a moment.

178
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,280
- Honey.
- Yeah?

179
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,840
Come here for a moment.

180
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,360
Okay.

181
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:31,340
Isn't this our child?

182
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,420
Wait, why is our child...

183
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:37,120
Do you know him?

184
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,110
People say he's Yeonhui University's doe-eyed hottie.

185
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:41,540
Isn't he so handsome?

186
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:44,320
- Doe-eyed hottie?
- Doe-eyed hottie?

187
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:48,960
I saw the doe-eyed hottie in real life.

188
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,170
Wow, he's super manly.

189
00:13:51,170 --> 00:13:53,700
- Manly?
- Why did he come to our afterparty?

190
00:13:53,700 --> 00:13:55,230
He must know someone.

191
00:13:55,230 --> 00:13:56,550
Right.

192
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,410
Didn't he carry Yunjae out that time?

193
00:13:58,410 --> 00:14:00,510
Carried him out? What's with Park Yunjae?

194
00:14:00,510 --> 00:14:02,930
He doesn't remember.

195
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:04,520
Do you know how heavy he was?

196
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,590
He was a total zombie.

197
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:09,610
He was really heavy to carry.

198
00:14:14,670 --> 00:14:15,760
Oppa.

199
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:17,200
Huh?

200
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:20,400
What are you looking at so seriously with a frown on your face?

201
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:22,300
It's nothing.

202
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,140
Everyone is talking about Kim Jihun in there.

203
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:30,190
It'll be awkward if you go in there right now.

204
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:32,030
I hear he's a conglomerate family's youngest son.

205
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:33,750
No, he's an idol.

206
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,940
I don't get it.

207
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:37,490
Why the fuss?

208
00:14:37,490 --> 00:14:38,740
Right?

209
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:42,330
You're the only one I'm curious about.

210
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:47,580
I should go to the library.

211
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:49,320
Really?

212
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,380
There's Park Yunjae.

213
00:14:58,000 --> 00:15:01,240
Woah. Isn't he the doe-eyed hottie?

214
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:06,000
- So handsome.
- So cute!

215
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:23,470
- Hello?
- This is Kim Jihun, right?

216
00:15:23,470 --> 00:15:26,700
- Who is this?
- Hello, I'm President Hot from YouTube.

217
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:30,210
I heard you're the Yeonhui doe-eyed hottie.

218
00:15:30,210 --> 00:15:32,210
I'm not the doe-eyed hottie.

219
00:15:32,210 --> 00:15:34,230
How did you get my number anyway?

220
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:37,210
You know the web novelist Mina, right?

221
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,200
I didn't love the idea,

222
00:15:40,200 --> 00:15:44,000
but there is no safer place, so I suggested meeting here.

223
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,240
It's been crazy, so I just brought toilet paper.

224
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,750
Thank you. Sit down.

225
00:15:53,480 --> 00:15:56,050
What is up with that Mina?

226
00:15:56,050 --> 00:15:57,830
How dare she give out my number?

227
00:15:57,830 --> 00:15:59,830
She's a born villain.

228
00:15:59,830 --> 00:16:02,560
She feels victimized by us.

229
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,400
I bet she's dancing like a happy witch right now.

230
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:11,060
When did they snap these photos, anyway?

231
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:13,470
What? This one is dated today!

232
00:16:13,470 --> 00:16:16,870
Gosh, what do I do?

233
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:27,770
You two... are serious about each other, right?

234
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:29,900
Well, of course.

235
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:31,760
- Yeah.
- Park Yunjae, what about you?

236
00:16:31,760 --> 00:16:33,840
Huh? Yeah.

237
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:37,180
You two love each other enough not to care about what the world thinks, right?

238
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:39,140
At the same time. One, two, three.

239
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:41,500
- Yes.
- That's all I needed to hear.

240
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:44,380
I'll clean up the mess I made.

241
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:45,740
What will you do?

242
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:50,510
The finale for Yeonhui University's doe-eyed hottie.

243
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:54,660
Chief Editor, this is Glass Shoes.

244
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:58,340
The fan signing event you mentioned the other day.

245
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:02,410
I changed my mind.

246
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,860
I'll do it.

247
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:09,340
And, of course, I'll reveal my face.

248
00:17:23,930 --> 00:17:27,550
♫  Can't stop, can't stop thinking about the  ♫

249
00:17:27,550 --> 00:17:31,260
♫  Through the cracks in the window where the wind of memory blows  ♫

250
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,990
Looks good.

251
00:17:38,830 --> 00:17:42,340
♫  Wake up and make up  ♫

252
00:17:42,340 --> 00:17:44,000
Nice.

253
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,140
Don't open your mouth too wide.

254
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:49,380
Like that.

255
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,290
So sexy.

256
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:55,200
♫  Can't stop, can't stop thinking about  ♫

257
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,440
There you go.

258
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,900
Exactly.

259
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:03,130
♫  From the space that is you  ♫

260
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:09,170
♫  Unable to leave, again like this,  ♫

261
00:18:09,170 --> 00:18:16,200
♫  I wander around you  ♫

262
00:18:16,200 --> 00:18:18,670
Will this actually be effective?

263
00:18:18,670 --> 00:18:22,300
She has more than 150,000 followers.

264
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,230
150,000?

265
00:18:24,230 --> 00:18:27,610
I didn't realize that you were such a famous author.

266
00:18:27,610 --> 00:18:29,710
Thanks for acknowledging it now.

267
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:33,730
It won't be totally useless once people start reposting it.

268
00:18:59,800 --> 00:19:02,700
- A cafe for civil servant exam students?
- That scared me.

269
00:19:03,430 --> 00:19:06,800
Are you thinking of playing hooky and preparing for the civil servant exam?

270
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:08,600
No.

271
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:11,290
Black cards are only available to holders with 10 billion in their account,

272
00:19:11,290 --> 00:19:13,530
and he has three of them.

273
00:19:13,530 --> 00:19:15,020
He's a VVIP.

274
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:18,080
- You should better make this happen.
- Okay.

275
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:22,170
Yes.

276
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,640
What a quiet and nice café.

277
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,250
That's our café's greatest strength.

278
00:19:35,250 --> 00:19:37,070
Come by and study here sometime.

279
00:19:37,070 --> 00:19:40,180
It might be quieter than the student dorm.

280
00:19:40,180 --> 00:19:41,740
Sure.

281
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,240
So, Yeongseok, what brought you here?

282
00:19:46,240 --> 00:19:49,410
I thought about it and noticed you were always the one who came to me.

283
00:19:49,410 --> 00:19:51,670
Well, I have nothing to do

284
00:19:51,670 --> 00:19:53,870
and you're a student, Yeongseok.

285
00:19:53,870 --> 00:19:56,460
But still, I'm a man.

286
00:19:56,460 --> 00:20:00,630
Sticking to gender roles is my pet peeve.

287
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,010
You haven't had lunch yet, have you?

288
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,170
I found a hot spot.

289
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:11,300
Oh, but I bet you know this area better.

290
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,220
I only know bars.

291
00:20:14,220 --> 00:20:16,240
Then, should we head out?

292
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:18,840
Give me five minutes.

293
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,360
Okay, I'll wait outside.

294
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,670
Yeongseok! You...

295
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:37,780
Baekje Hospital, Room 804.

296
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:41,200
I left my phone behind.

297
00:20:42,030 --> 00:20:43,750
Here it is.

298
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:45,870
Thank you.

299
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,750
Your dad is back at the hospital.

300
00:20:47,750 --> 00:20:50,590
He says he'd die with his eyes open if he doesn't meet your future wife.

301
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:54,190
What should we do about his stubbornness?

302
00:20:54,190 --> 00:20:56,310
It totally slipped my mind.

303
00:20:56,310 --> 00:21:00,900
I forgot that I have a group reservation this evening.

304
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,850
Let's grab food later.

305
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,580
Sorry.

306
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,050
O-Okay.

307
00:21:11,610 --> 00:21:13,410
- Let go of me!
- Come on!

308
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:16,620
Father, please don't do this!

309
00:21:18,090 --> 00:21:21,590
Did I ever pressure you to make money?

310
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:23,620
Or get a job?

311
00:21:23,620 --> 00:21:27,400
I just want you to get married like everyone else.

312
00:21:27,400 --> 00:21:31,020
Your father is about to die, and you can't do that for me?

313
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:34,380
Who would want to marry me when I have a father like you?

314
00:21:34,380 --> 00:21:35,420
What did you say?

315
00:21:35,420 --> 00:21:37,260
- How dare you?
- Honey!

316
00:21:37,260 --> 00:21:39,600
Is that all you have to say? Come over here.

317
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,030
- You bastard.
- W-Wait.

318
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,670
Who are you?

319
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:46,310
Mother. Father.

320
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:48,220
Good to meet you for the first time.

321
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:52,140
I'm Ham Jeongja.

322
00:21:52,140 --> 00:21:55,300
Jeongja, how did you get here?

323
00:21:58,060 --> 00:22:01,090
Do you know Yeongseok?

324
00:22:01,090 --> 00:22:04,020
I'm not a bad person.

325
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:08,170
I happened to learn about you and came to say hello.

326
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,910
My goodness.

327
00:22:09,910 --> 00:22:12,020
Could you be...

328
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,880
So, please don't worry.

329
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,980
If you just trust me and get your treatment,

330
00:22:20,980 --> 00:22:24,230
then wouldn't only happy days await us?

331
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,800
My goodness!

332
00:22:25,800 --> 00:22:28,010
I knew it.

333
00:22:28,010 --> 00:22:30,010
Look here.

334
00:22:30,010 --> 00:22:33,700
We don't need insurance.

335
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,120
- Pardon?
- Father, please behave.

336
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:39,100
The world has really come to this.

337
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:44,730
You want to do business with a dying old man?

338
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:47,460
How desperate do you have to be to do such a thing?

339
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,880
Shame on you!

340
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:50,750
Shame?

341
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,670
How could you say that to my baby?

342
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,350
You don't need to bring anything with you.

343
00:23:07,350 --> 00:23:10,630
Not even a single spoon.

344
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:13,390
People misunderstand because he studied for the civil servant exam for a long time,

345
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:16,080
and because of his looks.

346
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,840
But we only eat Korean beef in our family.

347
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:19,850
- And only the top grade at that.
- That's right.

348
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,330
Oh my, I love beef.

349
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:33,350
Why don't we... set the date?

350
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:37,940
F-Father, you just met her. How can you set the wedding date?

351
00:23:46,510 --> 00:23:50,870
He must really be in love.

352
00:23:50,870 --> 00:23:53,760
I was talking about a date to butcher a cow

353
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,560
and he took it the other way.

354
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,430
All right, all right. Very good.

355
00:24:01,430 --> 00:24:04,580
Yes, yes. Very good indeed.

356
00:24:08,800 --> 00:24:13,970
While we're at it, let's set the date for the wedding.

357
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:16,460
F-Father.

358
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:20,830
Well, I wouldn't mind that.

359
00:24:20,830 --> 00:24:22,800
Really?

360
00:24:22,800 --> 00:24:24,500
All right!

361
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,720
Amazing!

362
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:29,380
- We did it!
- Father!

363
00:24:29,380 --> 00:24:31,310
I can die in peace now!

364
00:24:31,310 --> 00:24:35,660
Woah, I'm so happy! I'm so happy!

365
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:38,520
Father, are you seeing this?

366
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,810
Father, your grandson is getting married!

367
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:43,060
So cute!

368
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:46,620
- Father, you'll get hurt! Come down.
- You'll fall!

369
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:49,650
You didn't have to bring such an expensive gift.

370
00:24:49,650 --> 00:24:53,030
You're a student, so you probably don't have much.

371
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:54,680
It's not expensive.

372
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:57,640
It's a popular bakery near Yeonhui University. It's good.

373
00:24:57,640 --> 00:25:02,300
How come you're so different from my son?

374
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,160
Mom, won't you leave?

375
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:10,300
Gosh, I wish you could be my son-in-law.

376
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:13,400
My dream is to dote on my son-in-law.

377
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:16,240
Mom, are you not going to leave? I need to study!

378
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,710
I'm leaving. I will.

379
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,130
Have a good study session.

380
00:25:23,200 --> 00:25:26,200
- Leave!
- My gosh!

381
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,540
Why did you lock the door?

382
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,230
Oh, this?

383
00:25:41,230 --> 00:25:43,640
I see you also follow Yuri.

384
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,330
Oh, right.

385
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:48,820
You said your dream is to be a web novelist.

386
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:51,540
Don't think you can brush this off.

387
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:53,450
I wished you—

388
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:58,180
I wished you good luck just the other day.

389
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:00,840
How dare you cheat already?

390
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,810
Yuna, it's not what you think.

391
00:26:04,810 --> 00:26:06,800
And with my favorite writer?

392
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,500
More than I feel bad for Park Yunjae,

393
00:26:10,500 --> 00:26:13,130
I feel sorry for myself for having been her fan ever since she debuted,

394
00:26:13,130 --> 00:26:15,700
only to lose her to my own overwhelming devotion.

395
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,840
I feel like I've been invalidated.

396
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,940
Do you know what that feels like?

397
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,010
Wait a second.

398
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:28,370
To summarize,

399
00:26:28,370 --> 00:26:31,840
you and my brother are indeed in love.

400
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:34,540
Your best friend is the novelist Glass Shoes,

401
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:37,760
and she's covering for you, like I have been?

402
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:39,290
Is that it?

403
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:42,350
Yes. I'm sorry,

404
00:26:42,350 --> 00:26:44,500
but could you speak quietly?

405
00:26:47,680 --> 00:26:49,040
Q-Quiet...

406
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,960
Be quiet. Quiet...

407
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,230
- What's your name?
- Yejin.

408
00:27:10,230 --> 00:27:11,810
Yejin.

409
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,950
Could you shake my hand?

410
00:27:19,570 --> 00:27:21,390
I'm a fan.

411
00:27:22,120 --> 00:27:23,280
Huh?

412
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:24,600
Huh?

413
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,380
Yuri 4?

414
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:28,280
You're my fan, too?

415
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:31,800
Whoa. You were Glass Shoes?

416
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,770
I thought you were far from

417
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:39,770
my romantic fantasy perspective of the world.

418
00:27:39,770 --> 00:27:41,680
I love romantic fantasy.

419
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,380
I've read everything by Glass Shoes.

420
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,130
I can't believe it.

421
00:27:46,130 --> 00:27:49,860
Yuri 4 is Glass Shoes...

422
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,870
The next person is waiting.

423
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,530
Will you go, please?

424
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,410
Hello.

425
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:08,600
- Your name?
- My codename is Penis Fish.

426
00:28:10,890 --> 00:28:13,300
Are you... Kim Ji...

427
00:28:13,300 --> 00:28:14,850
Yes, that's right!

428
00:28:14,850 --> 00:28:18,410
I'm a student currently being tutored by Jihun.

429
00:28:19,310 --> 00:28:22,420
I heard you're his best friend.

430
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:24,730
Oh, yes.

431
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:27,550
Wow, I thought he changed there for a second.

432
00:28:28,650 --> 00:28:30,300
Nice to meet you.

433
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:32,170
- What's your name?
- Park Yuna.

434
00:28:32,170 --> 00:28:33,250
- Park Yuna.
- Park Yuna...

435
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:34,580
Could you draw a heart, too?

436
00:28:34,580 --> 00:28:36,980
Oh, a heart?

437
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,820
This place is huge.

438
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,690
Choi Yuri was this big?

439
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:44,500
I know right?

440
00:28:46,100 --> 00:28:47,800
There's Yuri.

441
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:50,150
There she is.

442
00:28:50,150 --> 00:28:52,220
Wow.

443
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:56,180
Incredible. Is this the line?

444
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,110
Looks like it.

445
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:02,620
You didn't need to come with me.

446
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:06,090
You said this is the finale of Yeonhui University's doe-eyed hottie.

447
00:29:06,090 --> 00:29:09,000
I'm the protector of that doe-eyed hottie.

448
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,090
Wait a second.

449
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:21,360
That's my little sister, right?

450
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,210
It is.

451
00:29:25,210 --> 00:29:27,090
Shouldn't she be at school right now?

452
00:29:27,090 --> 00:29:28,870
Yuna.

453
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,180
It could get bad if we get involved.

454
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:33,670
Let's just quietly get an autograph and leave.

455
00:29:35,310 --> 00:29:36,780
What?

456
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:39,370
Isn't that Minhyeok?

457
00:29:42,210 --> 00:29:44,380
Hey, Park Yuna!

458
00:29:46,730 --> 00:29:48,300
Hey.

459
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:51,120
- Brother?
- Hyeong?

460
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,790
What are you two doing here right now?

461
00:29:52,790 --> 00:29:54,610
What do you think? Taking photos.

462
00:29:54,610 --> 00:29:56,750
Exactly. Why is he taking photos of you?

463
00:29:56,750 --> 00:30:00,110
She asked me, so I complied.

464
00:30:00,110 --> 00:30:03,360
Do you two know each other?

465
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:05,960
She's my little sister.

466
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:07,930
Oh, really?

467
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:11,840
Oh, looking at you two... you look identical.

468
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,250
- What?
- What?

469
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,430
So annoying.

470
00:30:15,430 --> 00:30:17,490
- What do you mean?
- Of course, I'm annoyed.

471
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,500
Hi, guys.

472
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:20,190
- Hyeong.
- Teacher!

473
00:30:20,190 --> 00:30:22,220
Aren't you supposed to be in school right now?

474
00:30:22,220 --> 00:30:23,890
I just stepped out during lunch.

475
00:30:23,890 --> 00:30:26,250
Hurry back while I'm still nice.

476
00:30:26,250 --> 00:30:27,800
Before I video call Mom.

477
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:29,990
You're such a pain.

478
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:33,630
See you later, Teacher.

479
00:30:33,630 --> 00:30:34,840
Okay. Bye.

480
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,490
So annoying. Of all places...

481
00:30:36,490 --> 00:30:38,320
Won't you hurry?

482
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,540
Gosh, seriously.

483
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:42,720
So annoying.

484
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,350
Writer, hello.

485
00:30:44,350 --> 00:30:46,380
Hello.

486
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:48,700
Hello.

487
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:51,550
- Gosh, thank you.
- I'm enjoying your book!

488
00:30:51,550 --> 00:30:54,380
Yes, thank you.

489
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:57,170
- Oh, yes.
- I loved your book.

490
00:30:59,230 --> 00:31:00,990
Oh my.

491
00:31:01,710 --> 00:31:03,330
Look who's here.

492
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:06,710
This is Glass Shoes' boyfriend!

493
00:31:12,290 --> 00:31:13,840
Hello.

494
00:31:13,840 --> 00:31:16,330
I could tell your looks were quite something.

495
00:31:16,330 --> 00:31:18,370
You were the doe-eyed hottie!

496
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:21,340
Gosh, I can't believe it.

497
00:31:21,340 --> 00:31:22,430
Who is this?

498
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:25,550
You know, Mina eonn—

499
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,920
Mina nuna.

500
00:31:29,390 --> 00:31:30,680
Why are you standing here?

501
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:33,210
Oh, I was about to line up.

502
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,090
Why would the boyfriend line up?

503
00:31:35,090 --> 00:31:37,720
You get a free pass. Come here.

504
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:38,880
I'm okay.

505
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:41,100
- Come here.
- I'm really okay.

506
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,900
Everyone, you know who he is. Right?

507
00:31:42,900 --> 00:31:45,610
This is Writer Glass Shoes' boyfriend.

508
00:31:45,610 --> 00:31:47,640
Her boyfriend. The doe-eyed hottie.

509
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,800
The doe-eyed hottie!

510
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,880
This can't be happening.

511
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:55,550
Writer Glass Shoes' boyfriend.

512
00:31:55,550 --> 00:31:57,840
Step aside.

513
00:31:57,840 --> 00:31:59,690
Yuri. Here.

514
00:31:59,690 --> 00:32:03,440
Woah, your boyfriend is here.

515
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,360
Really?

516
00:32:13,610 --> 00:32:15,430
I'm a fan.

517
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:18,890
"I'm a fan"? You sound so rigid.

518
00:32:18,890 --> 00:32:22,590
Give us sweet talk like you did the other day.

519
00:32:22,590 --> 00:32:26,340
Everyone, this is Glass Shoes' boyfriend.

520
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:28,850
Who knows about the doe-eyed hottie?

521
00:32:28,850 --> 00:32:30,740
Me!

522
00:32:30,740 --> 00:32:32,830
There we go!

523
00:32:33,610 --> 00:32:36,450
Hey, do something about this.

524
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:41,610
Babe, you made it.

525
00:32:47,460 --> 00:32:51,170
Hi, Babe.

526
00:32:51,170 --> 00:32:54,100
"Babe." He said "Babe."

527
00:32:55,950 --> 00:33:00,150
How does "The Private Life of a Goddess" end?

528
00:33:00,150 --> 00:33:02,420
With a kiss!

529
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:04,760
Yes, with a kiss!

530
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,880
Writer.

531
00:33:05,880 --> 00:33:09,850
The fans desperately want it.

532
00:33:09,850 --> 00:33:13,100
- Kiss!
- Kiss!

533
00:33:13,100 --> 00:33:16,330
Kiss! Hurry up!

534
00:33:16,330 --> 00:33:17,770
Hurry up!

535
00:33:17,770 --> 00:33:19,170
Kiss!

536
00:33:19,170 --> 00:33:21,220
- There we go!
- Kiss!

537
00:33:21,220 --> 00:33:24,690
Hey, what the heck is this?

538
00:33:24,690 --> 00:33:27,760
- Kiss!
- Hurry up!

539
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:30,920
- Kiss!
- Come on!

540
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:33,040
Kiss! Kiss!

541
00:33:33,040 --> 00:33:34,800
Let's do it.

542
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,030
- Are you crazy?
- You have to put a period to end the book.

543
00:33:39,030 --> 00:33:40,700
What are you talking about?

544
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,000
It's a bigger loss for me.

545
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:44,660
You know I've been single since birth. This would be my first kiss.

546
00:33:44,660 --> 00:33:46,980
So why would you do it?

547
00:33:46,980 --> 00:33:48,480
Can't you see them?

548
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:51,900
Actions speak louder than words.

549
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,800
- Just three seconds.
- Hey!

550
00:33:56,870 --> 00:34:00,460
Kiss! Kiss!

551
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:31,310
Hey, smile.

552
00:34:31,310 --> 00:34:33,530
I said smile.

553
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,920
They're kissing.

554
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,670
That looks like the doe-eyed hottie.

555
00:34:47,670 --> 00:34:48,670
It is him.

556
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,390
So, they were kissing?

557
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,500
What is this?

558
00:34:58,780 --> 00:35:01,210
Is that what it was?

559
00:35:14,980 --> 00:35:16,460
Welcome.

560
00:35:16,460 --> 00:35:18,870
Take a seat over there.

561
00:35:26,020 --> 00:35:29,790
Could I get one portion civil servant udon noodles?

562
00:35:29,790 --> 00:35:32,020
You don't look like a civil servant exam student.

563
00:35:32,020 --> 00:35:33,800
It's your first time here, right?

564
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:37,710
Yes, a friend studying in Noryangjin said

565
00:35:37,710 --> 00:35:39,930
you have the best noodles in the area.

566
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:40,940
Is that right?

567
00:35:40,940 --> 00:35:45,560
Goodness. Whoever they are, they'll make it big.

568
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:48,490
Our udon noodles are known for being cheap rather than for the taste.

569
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:50,950
It's a big portion.

570
00:35:50,950 --> 00:35:53,360
What's your friend's name?

571
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,280
It's Hong Yeongseok. Hong Yeongseok.

572
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,620
Yeongseok? Hong Yeongseok?

573
00:35:58,620 --> 00:36:00,380
Of course, I know him.

574
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:02,810
So you're Yeongseok's friend.

575
00:36:02,810 --> 00:36:04,750
Yeongseok came yesterday,

576
00:36:04,750 --> 00:36:07,150
the day before yesterday, and the day before that.

577
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:08,390
He's so consistent.

578
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,550
He only eats udon noodles.

579
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:21,030
Ma'am, if you're not too busy, would you like to share a Sprite with me?

580
00:36:26,650 --> 00:36:29,390
While we're at it, let's set the date for the wedding.

581
00:36:29,390 --> 00:36:33,420
Well, I wouldn't mind that.

582
00:37:14,880 --> 00:37:17,620
Gosh, I'm out of cigarettes.

583
00:37:30,810 --> 00:37:32,650
Hi.

584
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:34,800
Hey... you...

585
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:37,720
You didn't expect to see me here, huh?

586
00:37:37,720 --> 00:37:41,410
Yeah. What are you doing here?

587
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,760
The udon place lady told me.

588
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:50,590
She said you would be here.

589
00:37:50,590 --> 00:37:52,390
Oh, that lady.

590
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:55,480
Yeah, I come here often,

591
00:37:55,480 --> 00:37:57,850
because it's quiet here.

592
00:37:57,850 --> 00:38:00,660
How did you find the udon place lady, though?

593
00:38:00,660 --> 00:38:03,140
She seemed really popular on the online café for civil servant examinees.

594
00:38:03,140 --> 00:38:05,900
She has been touted as the president of Noryangjin.

595
00:38:05,900 --> 00:38:07,880
That's right.

596
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:09,740
Are you preparing for the exam, too?

597
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:12,860
No, I signed up to find you.

598
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,440
Me?

599
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:19,290
We didn't exchange numbers when we met last time.

600
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:23,550
I've been really curious about how you were doing.

601
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,760
Type in your number.

602
00:38:35,410 --> 00:38:37,560
You're not married, are you?

603
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,740
- No.
- Or about to get married?

604
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:42,170
Having kids is okay.

605
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:49,910
You're still your wild self, Kim Jihye.

606
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,800
Here it is.

607
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:02,710
It's ringing.

608
00:39:08,810 --> 00:39:12,990
We laughed a lot together when we were in school.

609
00:39:13,910 --> 00:39:16,150
I think I laughed my fill back then.

610
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:21,460
I'm still super funny.

611
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:23,220
Huh?

612
00:39:23,220 --> 00:39:24,900
The day after a company dinner,

613
00:39:24,900 --> 00:39:29,670
people take a sick day because their stomachs hurt from laughing.

614
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:31,370
They take a sick day?

615
00:39:31,370 --> 00:39:33,610
Because their stomachs hurt?

616
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,080
It hurts!

617
00:39:36,080 --> 00:39:38,400
Gosh, seriously.

618
00:39:40,240 --> 00:39:42,520
You hit as hard as usual.

619
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:55,590
Can I call you every once in a while?

620
00:39:56,470 --> 00:39:58,240
Sure.

621
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,570
But there will be a lot of times when I won't be able to pick up.

622
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,630
I'll call you back, though.

623
00:40:13,520 --> 00:40:17,010
It looked like you ran out of cigarettes.

624
00:40:40,270 --> 00:40:42,110
What's this?

625
00:40:46,990 --> 00:40:49,690
Smoking isn't good for your health, so don't do it too much~!

626
00:40:49,690 --> 00:40:51,630
From Jihye.

627
00:40:54,510 --> 00:40:57,190
Gosh, that wild girl.

628
00:41:23,470 --> 00:41:25,790
What is she doing?

629
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:35,050
Should I just forget about everything and make him mine?

630
00:41:35,050 --> 00:41:36,470
No, Choi Yuri.

631
00:41:36,470 --> 00:41:38,240
That would make you a bad bitch.

632
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,270
Jieun is struggling a lot right now.

633
00:41:42,620 --> 00:41:44,630
But...

634
00:41:46,770 --> 00:41:49,580
I'm struggling, too.

635
00:42:22,340 --> 00:42:24,350
So noisy.

636
00:42:24,350 --> 00:42:26,580
Let me sit with you.

637
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,690
- Ma'am.
- Yes?

638
00:42:31,690 --> 00:42:34,610
A Coke and rolled eggs.

639
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,960
- Also, some rice.
- Yes.

640
00:42:38,960 --> 00:42:40,930
What's up with you?

641
00:42:43,150 --> 00:42:46,200
Stop filling up with liquid. Eat some real food.

642
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,810
You probably starved all day.

643
00:42:53,150 --> 00:42:54,780
Cheers.

644
00:43:23,840 --> 00:43:25,770
What's all this?

645
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:33,800
Hey, what is this? What's going on?

646
00:43:34,790 --> 00:43:36,260
World War 29.

647
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,920
Dad bought stocks behind Mom's back.

648
00:43:38,920 --> 00:43:40,220
What's so bad about that?

649
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:42,760
She went as far as to kick Dad out?

650
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:45,620
He apparently lost 30 million won (~$30,000).

651
00:43:45,620 --> 00:43:47,680
What's this? This is Dad's.

652
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:50,410
It was sitting outside.

653
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,800
Seriously.

654
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:03,880
First shelf of the living room bookcase.

655
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:07,290
"The Know-Hows of an Expert on Getting Loved by His Wife"

656
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:12,400
Page 78, page 88, page 98.

657
00:44:14,180 --> 00:44:16,590
78...

658
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:07,860
Ma'am, could I have another glass?

659
00:45:07,860 --> 00:45:09,550
Yes.

660
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,330
Gosh, Dad.

661
00:45:14,260 --> 00:45:16,230
Straighten your shoulders.

662
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,210
A man can get into stocks at some point.

663
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:20,820
It happens.

664
00:45:20,820 --> 00:45:23,630
You only lost 30 million, not 300 million.

665
00:45:23,630 --> 00:45:25,410
It was 50 million.

666
00:45:25,410 --> 00:45:27,230
50 million?

667
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,130
You worked for the government all your life.

668
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:32,980
Why play stocks now?

669
00:45:32,980 --> 00:45:37,210
You told me not to touch money if I don't work for it.

670
00:45:37,210 --> 00:45:39,740
You told me that so many times.

671
00:45:50,010 --> 00:45:52,150
What do I do?

672
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:02,260
Go home.

673
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,040
Dad.

674
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:09,650
Let's just go home.

675
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:11,180
No, no.

676
00:46:11,180 --> 00:46:13,980
I need to stay away tonight.

677
00:46:14,960 --> 00:46:17,290
I'm sorry...

678
00:46:17,290 --> 00:46:21,260
that you had to see your dad in this state.

679
00:46:24,270 --> 00:46:26,040
Go.

680
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:40,920
Welcome.

681
00:46:57,730 --> 00:47:02,370
Do you know what life and soju have in common?

682
00:47:02,370 --> 00:47:06,340
Nuna, you haven't even had a single shot of soju.

683
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:11,600
The common point is that...

684
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:16,330
they both have two syllables!

685
00:47:17,250 --> 00:47:19,540
Should I just leave you and go?

686
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:27,330
I had my first-ever kiss today.

687
00:47:27,330 --> 00:47:30,660
But that kiss was not the beginning.

688
00:47:30,660 --> 00:47:33,010
It was the end. The end.

689
00:47:33,010 --> 00:47:35,960
If you were going to cover for him, doing it that decisively was the best way.

690
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,250
I also sensed

691
00:47:39,250 --> 00:47:41,740
that Yunjae and Jihun had that kind of relationship.

692
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:45,010
But that was my first kiss.

693
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:50,160
- Is it a problem that it was your first?
- Of course!

694
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:52,020
The first one is so important.

695
00:47:52,020 --> 00:47:55,570
I wouldn't be acting like this if it were my second or third.

696
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:04,390
This is not love.

697
00:48:04,390 --> 00:48:06,450
This is fandom.

698
00:48:29,140 --> 00:48:30,950
That crazy...

699
00:48:30,950 --> 00:48:32,050
Follow me.

700
00:48:32,050 --> 00:48:35,680
What? Nuna, why are you being like this?

701
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:37,850
I'm not ready for that yet.

702
00:48:37,850 --> 00:48:40,910
That's Park Yunjae, right?

703
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,720
Yunjae?

704
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:48,780
Why is he going in there?

705
00:48:48,780 --> 00:48:51,470
- Is he with Jihun?
- He went to his mom's shop earlier.

706
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:52,990
Then?

707
00:48:54,030 --> 00:48:56,820
I stayed up all night, thanks to you.

708
00:48:56,820 --> 00:48:58,180
What's with you?

709
00:48:58,180 --> 00:49:02,410
Yesterday, you told me I was pretty.

710
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:05,220
It has to be Kang Minju.

711
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:07,260
- Who?
- Kang Minju.

712
00:49:07,260 --> 00:49:09,610
She has a crush on Yunjae.

713
00:49:09,610 --> 00:49:12,650
He went to a motel with her?

714
00:49:12,650 --> 00:49:14,770
I knew something was off.

715
00:49:14,770 --> 00:49:16,380
Why? What is?

716
00:49:16,380 --> 00:49:17,510
Is he cheating?

717
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,230
I mean they asked each other how they slept.

718
00:49:20,230 --> 00:49:22,490
"Yesterday, you told me I was pretty."

719
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:24,530
Saying stuff like this.

720
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:40,150
- Mom.
- Yeah?

721
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,130
Could you teach me how to cut hair?

722
00:49:44,130 --> 00:49:45,320
What do you need that for?

723
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:49,530
I mean... It's not like I can get a job while I'm a guy.

724
00:49:49,530 --> 00:49:52,460
I thought I could learn at your shop.

725
00:49:52,460 --> 00:49:55,710
Yes, Honey. That sounds like a good idea.

726
00:49:55,710 --> 00:49:58,640
You think anyone can be a hairdresser?

727
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:01,360
You're not even good with your hands.

728
00:50:01,360 --> 00:50:04,420
That's why I'm asking you to teach me.

729
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,630
What's up, Yuri?

730
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,980
Me? I'm at my mom's shop.

731
00:50:23,250 --> 00:50:26,370
Yunjae? I talked to him earlier. Why?

732
00:50:26,980 --> 00:50:30,220
What? Motel?

733
00:50:30,220 --> 00:50:32,130
Who did you say he went with?

734
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,770
Where is he? Where is Park Yunjae?

735
00:50:50,770 --> 00:50:52,180
Did he really go in with Kang Minju?

736
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:53,970
That's what I'm telling you.

737
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:58,990
Hyeong, hi. I'm sorry we're seeing each other like this.

738
00:50:58,990 --> 00:51:02,290
How could Park Yunjae do this to me?

739
00:51:02,290 --> 00:51:04,430
Call him right now.

740
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:07,250
It's Yunjae!

741
00:51:14,440 --> 00:51:19,040
He was wearing a jacket earlier, but now it's gone.

742
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:23,540
What a bastard.

743
00:51:23,540 --> 00:51:25,580
I can't hold back.

744
00:51:25,580 --> 00:51:27,840
Hey, Park Yunjae!

745
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:31,080
Hey, hi. What are you doing here?

746
00:51:31,080 --> 00:51:32,880
What? Hi?

747
00:51:32,880 --> 00:51:36,370
You just got caught red-handed, yet you're acting so brazen.

748
00:51:37,230 --> 00:51:40,090
Hey, Kim Jieun! Come out!

749
00:51:44,360 --> 00:51:47,850
Hey, what's going on with you guys?

750
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:50,050
Jihun, why are you here?

751
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:54,390
We saw everything. We saw you enter and exit the motel.

752
00:51:54,390 --> 00:51:58,360
It's been an hour, seven minutes and thirty-four seconds.

753
00:52:00,000 --> 00:52:02,750
You were evem timing it?

754
00:52:02,750 --> 00:52:05,150
Did you go with Minju?

755
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:08,890
Did you go with Kang Minju?

756
00:52:08,890 --> 00:52:10,810
What are you...?

757
00:52:12,210 --> 00:52:14,680
I went with my dad.

758
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:20,010
Dad? Hey, why not just say you went with your mom?

759
00:52:23,600 --> 00:52:26,470
I get how this situation could lead to a misunderstanding,

760
00:52:26,470 --> 00:52:30,140
but I really came with my dad.

761
00:52:30,140 --> 00:52:31,470
Lead the way.

762
00:52:31,470 --> 00:52:33,300
- That's right.
- What?

763
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:35,610
If you're so confident, lead the way.

764
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,490
There you go!

765
00:52:38,210 --> 00:52:39,640
Do you really want to do this?

766
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,230
I have nothing more to lose.

767
00:52:42,230 --> 00:52:45,320
You'll have to come to my house to tutor.

768
00:52:47,490 --> 00:52:49,990
That's not what's important right now.

769
00:52:49,990 --> 00:52:52,580
You're hilarious today.

770
00:52:52,580 --> 00:52:53,900
Let's go.

771
00:52:53,900 --> 00:52:56,620
- Hey, follow me.
- Huh?

772
00:53:05,610 --> 00:53:08,760
Nuna, I think it's overkill for us to go, too.

773
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:10,660
Park Yunjae is the one who went overboard.

774
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,550
Hurry up and follow me.

775
00:53:16,840 --> 00:53:19,340
Hey. Look carefully.

776
00:53:19,340 --> 00:53:20,980
Will do.

777
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:24,790
Dad.

778
00:53:28,070 --> 00:53:30,030
Dad!

779
00:53:36,420 --> 00:53:37,570
Who are you?

780
00:53:37,570 --> 00:53:39,890
I see. You must be Kang Minju.

781
00:53:39,890 --> 00:53:41,410
No, no.

782
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:43,600
What's going on?

783
00:53:44,550 --> 00:53:48,340
I'm sorry. I had the wrong room number.

784
00:53:48,340 --> 00:53:50,010
Gosh.

785
00:53:50,010 --> 00:53:51,810
Sorry.

786
00:53:56,370 --> 00:53:58,330
No, it's the room next door.

787
00:53:58,330 --> 00:54:01,370
Room next door, my foot. Open the door now!

788
00:54:03,370 --> 00:54:04,970
It's really the room next door!

789
00:54:04,970 --> 00:54:07,450
I had the wrong room number.

790
00:54:07,450 --> 00:54:09,110
Follow me.

791
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,730
Look now.

792
00:54:18,470 --> 00:54:20,330
Dad?

793
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:24,230
Dad.

794
00:54:24,230 --> 00:54:27,970
You're so absent-minded. You left your jacket here.

795
00:54:31,860 --> 00:54:33,860
Look, it's my dad.

796
00:54:33,860 --> 00:54:36,130
My dad!

797
00:54:36,130 --> 00:54:38,700
It's my dad!

798
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:41,900
My dad! Guys, look. It's my dad.

799
00:54:41,900 --> 00:54:43,890
- Guys, my dad.
- Hello.

800
00:54:43,890 --> 00:54:45,910
My dad.

801
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:51,050
See? It's not Kang Minju.

802
00:54:51,050 --> 00:54:53,380
Dad.

803
00:54:53,380 --> 00:54:55,690
I'm sorry.

804
00:54:55,690 --> 00:54:59,020
Nuna. Nuna, where are you going?

805
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:06,530
Let's go. It's okay.

806
00:55:27,770 --> 00:55:29,930
I'm a bit upset.

807
00:55:30,750 --> 00:55:33,410
Never mind the others.

808
00:55:33,410 --> 00:55:36,180
I didn't expect you would doubt me.

809
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:38,210
I'm sorry.

810
00:55:38,210 --> 00:55:41,360
I kept telling myself there's no way,

811
00:55:41,360 --> 00:55:43,740
but Yuri was so sure about it.

812
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:47,290
I had no idea you had so little trust in me.

813
00:55:47,290 --> 00:55:50,540
If only I didn't see you with Kang Minju like that—

814
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:57,220
What did you see me doing with Kang Minju?

815
00:55:59,830 --> 00:56:03,670
To be honest, I saw it.

816
00:56:04,660 --> 00:56:07,260
You and Kang Minju were looking at each other tenderly at the café.

817
00:56:07,260 --> 00:56:08,900
I was?

818
00:56:11,090 --> 00:56:13,700
Oh, that was nothing.

819
00:56:13,700 --> 00:56:16,520
I knew you would say that.

820
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:19,310
That's why I didn't want to bring it up.

821
00:56:22,850 --> 00:56:24,590
I'm sorry.

822
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:27,060
But it's really nothing.

823
00:56:27,060 --> 00:56:30,270
She's nothing more than a junior.

824
00:56:30,270 --> 00:56:32,580
I'll keep my eyes on you.

825
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:37,450
Bye.

826
00:56:41,590 --> 00:56:43,500
But...

827
00:56:43,500 --> 00:56:45,810
I also have something to tell you.

828
00:56:47,030 --> 00:56:52,280
It wasn't fun watching you and Yuri kiss.

829
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:54,220
That wasn't a kiss.

830
00:56:54,220 --> 00:56:56,390
That was just one second—

831
00:56:58,260 --> 00:57:00,140
Three seconds?

832
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,740
I'm sorry.

833
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,540
From now on, I'll draw a clearer line.

834
00:57:10,310 --> 00:57:12,400
I'll keep my eyes on you.

835
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:14,680

Why do you look like this?

843
00:57:48,190 --> 00:57:52,170
Your mom said to come home right away.

844
00:57:52,170 --> 00:57:53,290
Looking like this?

845
00:57:53,290 --> 00:57:55,960
All can be forgiven if you're cute.

846
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:01,590
Not true. You're not cute at all.

847
00:58:01,590 --> 00:58:05,070
