(Chuu)

5
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,100
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

00:00:47,900 --> 00:00:49,033
Minjoo

7
00:00:49,467 --> 00:00:50,767
Dongqige

8
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,833
Why do you...

9
00:00:51,833 --> 00:00:53,000
Come to the movies with me this weekend

10
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:54,400
I have a date this weekend.

11
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:56,367
Even if you don't have an appointment, I won't go with you.

12
00:00:56,367 --> 00:00:58,933
I know but I like you

13
00:00:58,933 --> 00:01:00,467
What the hell? I fell in love with you at first sight.

14
00:01:00,467 --> 00:01:02,567
You are the only one in my eyes

15
00:01:02,567 --> 00:01:04,433
She knows so many brothers.

16
00:01:04,433 --> 00:01:06,133
That's your own business

17
00:01:06,133 --> 00:01:07,400
I will treat you well

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:08,933
But why should I hide?

19
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,500
I will do better than that Park Yoon Jae

20
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,367
Why did you mention Yun Jae?

21
00:01:15,367 --> 00:01:18,467
Yun-jae? My credits are higher than his and my future is bright.

22
00:01:18,467 --> 00:01:20,467
Just say my parents run a golf course

23
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:23,633
elder brother

24
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,267
If you say a few more words

25
00:01:27,267 --> 00:01:30,700
I really don't want to see you again

26
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,000
Do you want to continue?

27
00:01:34,433 --> 00:01:37,500
If you still want to keep in touch with me in the future

28
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:38,867
Then leave quickly

29
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,133
And I never thought of you as a man

30
00:01:43,133 --> 00:01:45,767
I will never do that again.

31
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,933
What should I do so that you will treat me as a man?

32
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:54,067
Rebirth

33
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:56,700
Then I'll consider it.

34
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,100
Get out of the way

35
00:02:01,533 --> 00:02:04,233
Minjoo, can you please look at me?

36
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:05,533
I'm gonna scream

37
00:02:06,067 --> 00:02:07,400
Who can help me?

38
00:02:10,700 --> 00:02:11,700
Who can help me?

39
00:02:49,867 --> 00:02:50,800
Brother Zhixun

40
00:02:51,267 --> 00:02:52,467
Brother?

41
00:02:52,467 --> 00:02:53,667
Hey, who are you?

42
00:02:53,667 --> 00:02:54,933
How are you

43
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:56,467
Who is this guy?

44
00:02:56,467 --> 00:02:58,200
Leave him alone, let's go.

45
00:02:59,967 --> 00:03:01,333
Really

46
00:03:01,333 --> 00:03:03,067
Let's go, don't touch Minjoo's shoulders.

47
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:10,700
There are people who ask for a beating.

48
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:18,867
Are you okay?

49
00:03:18,867 --> 00:03:20,333
certainly

50
00:03:20,333 --> 00:03:23,067
Although I look weak, I am actually very strong

51
00:03:23,067 --> 00:03:24,267
You don't look weak at all.

52
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,833
But who is that guy?

53
00:03:27,833 --> 00:03:29,700
His name is Min Dongqi and he is a senior in the department

54
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,633
It seems like he's following me.

55
00:03:30,633 --> 00:03:31,833
Min Dongqi?

56
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,600
You really have encountered everything.

57
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,333
But have you ever learned martial arts?

58
00:03:37,333 --> 00:03:39,300
I discovered this the last time I worked at the palace.

59
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,300
You're very stylish.

60
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:44,000
Kendo in primary schools in my country

61
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,433
I thought I had forgotten everything, but I remembered it when I picked this up.

62
00:03:47,233 --> 00:03:49,433
Is this a bubble machine?

63
00:03:49,433 --> 00:03:50,900
Is it yours?

64
00:03:53,367 --> 00:03:54,933
I picked it up on the road

65
00:03:57,133 --> 00:03:58,867
I want to blow it too.

66
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:08,400
So cool

67
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,700
I haven't played for a long time. It's fun.

68
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:14,900
But this place is awesome. I really moved to the right place.

69
00:04:15,967 --> 00:04:18,400
You just moved in and you're being followed. Is that the right place to move?

70
00:04:19,233 --> 00:04:22,300
The air at night is so nice

71
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,067
You're really hard to communicate with.

72
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:26,900
I want a beer

73
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:29,067
Ji-hoon, do you want to drink beer with me?

74
00:04:29,067 --> 00:04:31,367
I'll treat you to fried chicken, so help yourself.

75

My Sister

76
00:04:33,633 --> 00:04:36,267
No, it's Brother.

77
00:04:36,267 --> 00:04:37,733
Would you like a beer?

78
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,433
I'll treat you to fried chicken.

79
00:04:39,967 --> 00:04:41,900
A guest is coming.

80
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:45,467
It's the vixen who moved next door...

81
00:04:48,133 --> 00:04:50,933
Half sauce fried chicken and half original fried chicken

82
00:04:50,933 --> 00:04:52,133
OK

83
00:04:55,233 --> 00:04:57,100
Really

84
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,333
So beautiful

85
00:05:03,533 --> 00:05:06,567
(Episode 8: Sharing the Pillow with the Enemy 2)

86
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:30,300
Dad and Mom went to see the maple leaves for two days and one night

87
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:31,900
Unless it's a matter of life and death

88
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,367
Otherwise, calling and texting are prohibited.

89
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:38,633
Have dinner and watch a movie together

90
00:05:38,633 --> 00:05:40,800
Chat about everything

91
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:41,800
Kiss

92
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
I only teach you some useless things.

93
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,400
No kissing

94
00:05:46,667 --> 00:05:50,633
Have dinner and watch a movie together

95
00:05:50,633 --> 00:05:52,633
Chat about everything

96
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:56,033
No kissing

97
00:05:59,667 --> 00:06:00,667
What to feed

98
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:02,500
My parents are going to see the maple leaves and will stay overnight outside.

99
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,333
I know. I told my dad.

100
00:06:04,333 --> 00:06:05,600
Really?

101
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:09,400
Hey, don't you have tutoring today?

102
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,633
Yes, but I want to ask the teacher for a postponement.

103
00:06:11,633 --> 00:06:12,167
Why

104
00:06:12,167 --> 00:06:13,867
Why do I need tutoring when my parents are not around?

105
00:06:13,867 --> 00:06:16,033
I'm going to the movies and singing with my friends

106
00:06:17,267 --> 00:06:19,767
Aren't your friends also in their third year of high school?

107
00:06:20,767 --> 00:06:22,500
What a stupid question.

108
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,000
I really don't know how you got into Yanxi University.

109
00:06:28,867 --> 00:06:31,733
In this case, your tutoring class should not be postponed

110
00:06:31,733 --> 00:06:33,733
How about attending class as usual?

111
00:06:34,733 --> 00:06:37,400
What I mean is

112
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:39,367
Even though you're not at home

113
00:06:39,367 --> 00:06:41,200
But Zhixun will still come to the tutoring class

114
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,867
Do you want to invite the teacher to your home to play?

115
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,233
OK

116
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:54,633
Thank you

117
00:06:54,633 --> 00:06:56,700
But what are you doing at home alone?

118
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,900
Watch a movie together

119
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,100
Just watching movies?

120
00:07:02,333 --> 00:07:03,733
Don't open your eyes yet

121
00:07:32,133 --> 00:07:35,533
Hello, I'm Team Leader Jin Zhihui

122
00:07:35,533 --> 00:07:36,933
(Jin Zhihui VIP Team Leader)

123
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:38,300
Nice to meet you

Judge, doctor, lawyer

126
00:07:51,533 --> 00:07:52,900
Annoying teacher

127
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:55,967
Can't we be a little more creative?

128
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,067
What

129
00:07:59,167 --> 00:08:00,833
What does it mean to be creative?

130
00:08:00,833 --> 00:08:04,267
Tai Chi Grandmaster Dark Mage Church Pastor

131
00:08:04,267 --> 00:08:07,167
Aren't these also teachers?

132
00:08:14,933 --> 00:08:18,467
You are so funny

133
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:22,533
In addition to their outstanding professional

134
00:08:22,533 --> 00:08:24,033
In family relationships and personality

135
00:08:24,033 --> 00:08:27,033
The highest level in all aspects

136
00:08:27,033 --> 00:08:29,433
I only have my mother

137
00:08:29,433 --> 00:08:31,233
Our family is a single-parent family

138
00:08:31,233 --> 00:08:34,800
When my father was alive, the relationship between my parents was not good.

139
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:38,567
This will certainly affect my character.

140
00:08:38,567 --> 00:08:41,733
That's why I doubt marriage.

141
00:08:41,733 --> 00:08:43,833
My mom dragged me here.

142
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:47,233
Aren't people like me also VVIPs?

143
00:08:51,433 --> 00:08:52,533
yes

144
00:08:55,933 --> 00:08:59,900
Then please make the conditions yourself.

145
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:03,233
I will actively look for the right person

146
00:09:05,233 --> 00:09:06,600
Really

147
00:09:56,933 --> 00:09:58,633
You are at home

148
00:09:58,633 --> 00:09:59,700
Welcome

149
00:10:01,833 --> 00:10:03,200
What are these?

150
00:10:04,067 --> 00:10:05,567
My parents went on a trip

151
00:10:05,567 --> 00:10:07,533
Because I want to play with you

152
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:09,100
I'll leave it to Park Yun-ah

153
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:12,733
Is this really okay?

154
00:10:12,733 --> 00:10:14,400
We didn't do anything bad.

155
00:10:15,233 --> 00:10:16,633
Let’s eat first

156
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:18,533
Sit here

157
00:10:23,767 --> 00:10:25,200
Wait a minute

158
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:30,467
Okay, let's get started.

159
00:10:33,033 --> 00:10:34,500
I always feel a little subtle

160
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:37,200
I never came to your house when I was your girlfriend

161
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,267
You are my girlfriend now, okay?

162
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:41,600
Although that’s true...

163
00:10:42,533 --> 00:10:44,300
But did you do all this?

164
00:10:52,133 --> 00:10:53,300
Oh my god

165
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,500
I'm afraid that after you finish eating it you will mistakenly think that I bought it ready-made.

166
00:10:56,167 --> 00:10:58,033
Just preserve the crime scene.

167
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:01,900
cheers

168
00:11:12,567 --> 00:11:14,500
Then let's try Park Yun-jae's strength

169
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:25,567
What?

170
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:27,700
It's so delicious

171
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,633
I'll just say it.

172
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:31,133
If the scene is not preserved

173
00:11:31,133 --> 00:11:32,100
Are you misunderstood

174
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,133
Will definitely

175
00:12:01,133 --> 00:12:02,233
for you

176
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,333
Thanks

177
00:12:04,867 --> 00:12:06,067
What are you looking at?

178
00:12:07,667 --> 00:12:11,100
I didn't notice this when I came here last time.

179
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:14,800
Found "Romantic Dinner"

180
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:17,133
You said you wanted to watch this before, right?

181
00:12:17,133 --> 00:12:18,200
Um

182
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:21,967
But... where is this

183
00:12:26,367 --> 00:12:29,367
Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii

184
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,067
It used to be my dream

185
00:12:36,067 --> 00:12:40,000
From there you can see the Milky Way, which is 12.8 billion light-years away from Earth.

186
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:42,800
12.8 billion years is far enough

187
00:12:43,500 --> 00:12:45,300
Is it 12.8 billion light years?

188
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,667
If I lived in a place like this and watched the stars

189
00:12:50,667 --> 00:12:52,400
He should be able to write The Little Prince, right?

190
00:12:53,933 --> 00:12:54,933
Yeah

191
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,133
If you want to go, I will try my best.

192
00:12:59,033 --> 00:13:01,033
We can go together.

193
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:06,400
You said this is Hawaii, right?

194
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,567
Um

195
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:12,567
I have to quickly turn back into Jin Zhien

196
00:13:13,233 --> 00:13:15,600
This way you can get on the plane smoothly with your passport

197
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:21,167
Yes

198
00:13:24,167 --> 00:13:26,300
Let's go to the living room and watch a movie

199
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,633
OK

200
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:38,133
To connect this to the TV

201
00:13:40,633 --> 00:13:43,167
I won't travel with you anymore.

202
00:13:44,900 --> 00:13:46,767
Me too, okay?

203
00:13:46,767 --> 00:13:50,600
Suddenly, I should have seen through the idea of viewing the maple leaves.

204
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,100
Because you love to nag me when I'm driving

205
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,500
That's why I took the wrong road.

206
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,833
Is it my fault again?

207
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:56,933
hateful

208
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,700
Oh my god, this is...

209
00:14:00,067 --> 00:14:01,600
What are these

210
00:14:03,533 --> 00:14:06,767
Mom, this is what happened...

211
00:14:08,967 --> 00:14:10,667
Wait a moment

212
00:14:10,667 --> 00:14:12,267
this…

213
00:14:12,267 --> 00:14:14,367
This is my treasured red wine.

214
00:14:15,733 --> 00:14:17,000
Is anyone coming home?

215
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,700
Did you eat these yourself?

216
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:28,967
No, it’s just…

217
00:14:28,967 --> 00:14:30,367
Here's what happened

218
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:33,600
It's Yuna. Yuna and I ate it together.

219
00:14:35,767 --> 00:14:38,833
She's a senior in high school, so the pressure must be huge.

220
00:14:38,833 --> 00:14:40,733
As a brother, I feel sad when I see this.

221
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,200
Where is Yun'e now?

222
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:44,133
Yun-e?

223
00:14:46,267 --> 00:14:48,467
Her friend came to see her and she went out

224
00:14:58,533 --> 00:15:00,100
OMG

225
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:03,667
Why is the house so messy?

226
00:15:05,033 --> 00:15:08,400
What are the ghosts busy with? Why don't they come and take away these Parks?

227
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,433
Why bring up last name?

228
00:15:11,633 --> 00:15:12,633
So angry

229
00:15:12,633 --> 00:15:14,000
mom…

230
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,467
You go into your room and calm down for thirty minutes.

231
00:15:16,467 --> 00:15:18,233
I will recover

232
00:15:18,233 --> 00:15:20,433
Dad too... Hello

233
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:22,800
Would I want to share a room with your dad right now?

234
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:24,600
I don't want to either, okay?

235
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:34,367
Son, your mother has a really bad personality.

236
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:37,233
Wasn't it a journey of reconciliation? Why are we back again after quarreling?

237
00:15:37,233 --> 00:15:38,533
Hello

238
00:15:38,533 --> 00:15:42,233
She complained about the dirtiness of the car from the start

239
00:15:42,233 --> 00:15:44,267
Then I complained that the food at the rest stop was unpalatable.

240
00:15:44,267 --> 00:15:46,800
Why spend a lot of money to sleep outside?

241
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,300
Complaining about everything

242
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,667
What can I do?

243
00:15:49,667 --> 00:15:51,733
Can I stay calm?

244
00:15:51,733 --> 00:15:52,900
It's so infuriating.

245
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:54,067
dad

246
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:57,800
You look so tired

247
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,367
Come to my room and rest first.

248
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,800
Go to sleep quickly

249
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:04,233
Have a good rest

250
00:16:12,533 --> 00:16:13,567
Great Grace

251
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,333
teacher

252
00:16:30,133 --> 00:16:32,400
Hello, auntie

253
00:16:32,400 --> 00:16:33,433
Hello

254
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,067
Yes, I have a tutoring class today.

255
00:16:37,067 --> 00:16:39,033
I forget when I'm busy

256
00:16:39,833 --> 00:16:42,833
But did you come in from that side?

257
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,033
What

258
00:16:45,333 --> 00:16:47,867
Because the window is open...

259
00:16:50,067 --> 00:16:51,133
What nonsense are you talking about?

260
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:54,067
This is a high-rise building. How could it be possible to get in through the window?

261
00:16:54,067 --> 00:16:55,533
The teacher just arrived

262
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:02,167
I'm really busy.

263
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:06,767
Where did this girl go after messing up the house?

264
00:17:06,767 --> 00:17:08,433
If this girl comes back...

265
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:11,633
sorry

266
00:17:12,233 --> 00:17:14,167
Auntie, don't say that.

267
00:17:14,167 --> 00:17:16,800
I'll come back next week then.

268
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,767
OK

269
00:17:20,333 --> 00:17:21,600
Hi, teacher

270
00:17:23,433 --> 00:17:25,500
Yun'e, did you have fun with my brother?

271
00:17:26,367 --> 00:17:28,400
Mom, when did you come back?

272
00:17:28,400 --> 00:17:31,167
Stand still, you little bitch.

273
00:17:31,167 --> 00:17:34,133
What's going on?

274
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:35,200
aunt

275
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,833
Do you skip your tutoring classes right away when your parents aren't home?

276
00:17:37,833 --> 00:17:40,100
What? It was Park Yun-jae who asked me to leave.

277
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,933
How dare you make excuses?

278
00:17:44,633 --> 00:17:48,000
And since I cooked the meal

279
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,867
Just clean it up well.

280
00:17:49,867 --> 00:17:51,067
no…

281
00:17:51,067 --> 00:17:52,833
My wife is so mad

282
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:55,233
If you have something to say, talk it over nicely

283
00:17:55,233 --> 00:17:58,000
How can you use violence when you are a churchgoer?

284
00:17:58,000 --> 00:18:00,200
Yes, you are still giving advice.

285
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,533
Dare to talk back

286
00:18:16,733 --> 00:18:17,800
husband

287
00:18:18,533 --> 00:18:19,633
I'm fine

288
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,667
Why don't you get out of the way?

289
00:18:37,267 --> 00:18:38,333
Sister Yuli

290
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,300
Hello

291
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:44,833
Hello

292
00:18:47,967 --> 00:18:50,800
It's so delicious and warm

293
00:18:56,233 --> 00:18:58,133
The weather has gotten much cooler

294
00:18:58,133 --> 00:18:59,833
What do you do after closing?

295
00:18:59,833 --> 00:19:02,900
I have to go home soon. That's the time I look forward to the most.

296
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,067
Yeah

297
00:19:04,667 --> 00:19:07,833
I'm so envious of being able to look forward to the "end"

298
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:13,033
If I had to choose between a deadline and the end of the world

299
00:19:13,033 --> 00:19:14,633
I would definitely choose the end of the world

300
00:19:15,467 --> 00:19:17,067
I can understand you

301
00:19:17,567 --> 00:19:19,600
But don't put too much pressure on yourself

302
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:20,867
You only live once

303
00:19:20,867 --> 00:19:22,667
Have a happy and interesting life

304
00:19:22,667 --> 00:19:24,500
That's right

305
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,867
But I didn't go to school

306
00:19:26,867 --> 00:19:28,633
Only one friend

307
00:19:28,633 --> 00:19:30,667
I live far away from my parents.

308
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:36,167
I don't know how to have fun.

309
00:19:36,167 --> 00:19:38,600
There are many interesting things in this world.

310
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:41,600
Nightclub KTV Escape Room Bowling

311
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:45,033
I've been to all of these, but none of them suit my interests.

312
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:54,733
fortunately

313
00:19:55,967 --> 00:19:57,333
You are wearing sneakers

314
00:20:00,167 --> 00:20:03,000
I'm almost off work. Please wait for me for ten minutes.

315
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:15,467
Is there anything fun here?

316
00:20:15,467 --> 00:20:16,867
It seems not

317
00:20:17,733 --> 00:20:18,867
Believe me

318
00:20:18,867 --> 00:20:21,167
You will forget what boredom is.

319
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:25,067
Listen carefully

320
00:20:25,933 --> 00:20:27,933
We're going to start running.

321
00:20:27,933 --> 00:20:29,467
No need to run fast

322
00:20:29,467 --> 00:20:32,067
Maintain a good pace and run for 30 minutes

323
00:20:32,067 --> 00:20:33,600
Thirty-minute run?

324
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,567
Hey, I'm too lazy to even go to the convenience store near my home

325
00:20:37,567 --> 00:20:39,233
They all ordered delivery.

326
00:20:39,233 --> 00:20:41,467
That's why your life is so boring.

327
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,367
I can't do it

328
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,900
Believe me, you can do it.

329
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:53,367
Come on what

330
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,733
I'm dying of exhaustion.

331
00:20:59,733 --> 00:21:02,467
It's okay to be tired. This direction is correct.

332
00:21:02,467 --> 00:21:03,933
Hey, run by yourself first.

333
00:21:03,933 --> 00:21:05,767
I really can't do it anymore

334
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,933
I feel like I can't do it, but I can still do it

335
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,533
Come on

336
00:21:13,467 --> 00:21:14,667
So tired

337
00:21:16,133 --> 00:21:18,500
Hey, run away by yourself

338
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,233
Run

339
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,233
Come on, hurry up

340
00:21:22,233 --> 00:21:24,100
Come on, hurry up

341
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,200
Run

342
00:21:26,200 --> 00:21:27,433
Set off

343
00:21:27,433 --> 00:21:29,100
Run!

344
00:21:30,200 --> 00:21:32,233
Please...

345
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,667
Please

346
00:21:33,667 --> 00:21:35,367
You ran away by yourself

347
00:21:38,667 --> 00:21:42,167
"Would you tell me why I love you?"

348
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:46,967
"Will you express your throbbing feelings?"

349
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:53,267
"I miss you all the time"

350
00:21:54,233 --> 00:21:58,233
"The whole world is filled with you"

351
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:02,733
"Sometimes I wonder if I put pressure on you."

352
00:22:02,733 --> 00:22:07,333
"I will approach you carefully."

353
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:12,633
"So Lovey oh Dovey"

354
00:22:12,633 --> 00:22:15,000
"Lovely and charming"

355
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,233
Almost finished running

356
00:22:16,233 --> 00:22:18,600
"My heart feels like it's going to explode"

357
00:22:19,633 --> 00:22:22,267
"This feeling, this throbbing"

358
00:22:22,267 --> 00:22:25,433
"I love it all"

359
00:22:25,433 --> 00:22:27,900
"I like you because of you"

360
00:22:30,167 --> 00:22:31,867
I'm dying

361
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:34,833
Feeling like dying

362
00:22:34,833 --> 00:22:36,333
But I can't die

363
00:22:38,233 --> 00:22:39,800
You still finished running

364
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,633
I'm really dying

365
00:22:50,267 --> 00:22:51,833
Come

366
00:22:59,567 --> 00:23:01,567
Run like this

367
00:23:01,567 --> 00:23:03,367
You won't feel bored anymore.

368
00:23:04,367 --> 00:23:07,767
Although this is not what I want

369
00:23:07,767 --> 00:23:09,567
But I don't feel bored

370
00:23:09,567 --> 00:23:12,733
You see, I was right.

371
00:23:12,733 --> 00:23:15,600
But let me run again

372
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:17,200
I probably can't do it

373
00:23:18,267 --> 00:23:20,300
I will be like today

374
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,500
Run with you

375
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:24,367
Until you feel that it is worse than the end of the world

376
00:23:24,367 --> 00:23:26,867
Until the deadline is better

(Glass Slipper Writing Notes)

378
00:23:50,267 --> 00:23:52,733
The focus of online novels is details

379
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:58,267
Record the subtle moments in life as scenes

380
00:23:58,267 --> 00:24:02,000
Whether it is text or drawing, any method can be

381
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:23,833
(My name is Jin Zhien)

382
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,900
What's going on so late?

383
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:44,867
Is Sister Zhihui here?

384
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:45,800
Sister Zhihui

385
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,800
She's not here

386
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:53,133
Why are you looking for her?

387
00:24:53,133 --> 00:24:55,333
Please pass it to her for me

388
00:24:55,333 --> 00:24:56,300
What's this

389
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,133
Last time we had a beer on the rooftop

390
00:24:58,133 --> 00:24:59,933
Sister Zhihui said my blush looks good

391
00:24:59,933 --> 00:25:02,733
I bought one for her while I was shopping for cosmetics

392
00:25:02,733 --> 00:25:04,600
And this is for you.

393
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,100
Is it for me?

394
00:25:10,567 --> 00:25:11,867
Good night

395
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:30,900
How is this

396
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:42,533
Thank you, neighbor next door

397
00:25:42,533 --> 00:25:44,567
What should I do with her?

398
00:25:45,733 --> 00:25:48,600
How did she know I like rabbits?

399
00:25:55,967 --> 00:25:57,333
Are you moving?

400
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,400
alright

401
00:26:37,733 --> 00:26:39,267
Go to class

402
00:26:39,267 --> 00:26:41,467
(Yanxi University & Corning University recruit exchange students)
Let's go

403
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:44,467
Where is this

404
00:26:48,167 --> 00:26:51,467
Mauna Kea Observatory in Hawaii

405
00:26:51,467 --> 00:26:53,333
It used to be my dream

406
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,233
If I lived in a place like this and watched the stars

407
00:26:55,233 --> 00:26:57,400
He should be able to write The Little Prince, right?

408
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,600
If you want to go, I will try my best.

409
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:03,133
We can go together.

410
00:27:04,933 --> 00:27:07,733
I have to quickly turn back into Jin Zhien

411
00:27:07,733 --> 00:27:10,600
This way you can get on the plane smoothly with your passport

412
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,133
I really don't want to go to class

413
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,133
Don't be late

414
00:27:18,533 --> 00:27:20,100
Very handsome, right?

415
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,433
See it in person to see the spectacular

416
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,267
When did you come?

417
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:26,267
just

418
00:27:26,267 --> 00:27:29,500
How nice it would be if we could study together here

419
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:31,100
You go apply.

420
00:27:31,100 --> 00:27:33,533
There's a high chance you'll be selected.

421
00:27:34,667 --> 00:27:36,767
I've only been abroad as an exchange student for a year.

422
00:27:36,767 --> 00:27:38,633
You were snatched away by another girl.

423
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:40,767
Do I dare to leave you here and go abroad by yourself?

424
00:27:40,767 --> 00:27:42,067
The barrier between us

425
00:27:42,067 --> 00:27:45,033
It took a lot of effort to lower the high wall into a speed bump

426
00:27:45,033 --> 00:27:47,533
Who said it got lower?

427
00:27:47,533 --> 00:27:50,233
I think so

428
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:52,067
The relationship between you and me is not based on feelings

429
00:27:52,067 --> 00:27:54,533
Speak based on facts

430
00:27:54,533 --> 00:27:57,933
Our relationship hasn't really changed.

431
00:27:57,933 --> 00:28:00,300
Class starts in three minutes

432
00:28:00,300 --> 00:28:01,600
I'm leaving first

433
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:03,433
Let's go together

434
00:28:17,700 --> 00:28:18,733
I'm back

435
00:28:18,733 --> 00:28:20,200
I'm back

436
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,533
Really

437
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:28,700
Someone who will be hospitalized tomorrow

438
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:30,900
Lie down and rest more.

439
00:28:32,633 --> 00:28:35,267
One of the reasons I didn't want to be hospitalized

440
00:28:36,633 --> 00:28:39,467
You can't take this potted plant with you.

441
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:43,833
Come over whenever you have time.

442
00:28:43,833 --> 00:28:45,533
Take good care of it

443
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:48,200
The Jin family next door will help take care of it.

444
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:49,600
You are such a real person

445
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:51,467
Even if the neighbors care

446
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,133
Can you take care of it as well as I can?

447
00:28:56,133 --> 00:28:57,533
knew

448
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:59,700
You lie down and rest first

449
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,200
mom

450
00:29:02,167 --> 00:29:06,033
This orchid is better than human life

451
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:07,100
Go wash your hands

452
00:29:07,100 --> 00:29:09,400
Where are you going

453
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,700
Please help my son get some food.

454
00:29:12,700 --> 00:29:14,067
Use food sparingly

455
00:29:14,067 --> 00:29:15,867
You

456
00:29:16,667 --> 00:29:20,000
Don't skimp on ingredients.

457
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,767
Really

458
00:29:27,933 --> 00:29:31,400
Do you plan to keep your hair long?

459
00:29:33,767 --> 00:29:35,733
right

460
00:29:35,733 --> 00:29:38,067
Until I pass the exam

461
00:29:38,067 --> 00:29:39,633
Really

462
00:29:41,067 --> 00:29:43,967
There are so many tricks for the exam.

463
00:29:45,067 --> 00:29:46,967
I will definitely pass the exam this year

464
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,000
Don't be too stressed

465
00:29:52,367 --> 00:29:55,100
I don't expect you to pass the exam.

466
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,733
Thank you

467
00:30:03,333 --> 00:30:05,367
Let me die before

468
00:30:05,367 --> 00:30:08,100
Seeing my daughter-in-law with my own eyes

469
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,933
What daughter-in-law

470
00:30:09,933 --> 00:30:11,900
She's not yet

471
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,033
And what did you say?

472
00:30:14,033 --> 00:30:16,033
I was hospitalized just to survive.

473
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:23,900
I mean, I have no regrets in death.

474
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:27,033
There is someone who can accompany you

475
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:29,133
People eating together

476
00:30:30,633 --> 00:30:32,700
It's my lifelong wish

477
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,067
Marrying to have dinner together?

478
00:30:37,067 --> 00:30:39,333
That's important, okay?

479
00:30:43,067 --> 00:30:44,700
It's all my fault

480
00:30:45,767 --> 00:30:48,133
I only realized this so late.

481
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:52,967
Stop talking

482
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:56,267
I earn enough money for you to spend.

483
00:30:57,933 --> 00:31:00,067
You can use it to accumulate memories

484
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:04,100
Make your family happy

485
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,900
Your money is not my money

486
00:31:07,233 --> 00:31:09,900
Stop talking nonsense and go in and rest.

487
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,433
I have to leave for the hospital early tomorrow morning.

488
00:31:41,067 --> 00:31:43,000
Really beautiful

489
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,567
Welcome

490
00:32:22,167 --> 00:32:26,633
How can this guy have the nerve to make people wait?

491
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:30,000
(Mission of Love)

492
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,333
you

493
00:32:31,333 --> 00:32:32,700
Eliminated

494
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,533
disuse…

495
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:39,667
Eliminated

496
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:42,267
Miss Gao Yingmei?

497
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:45,167
Is there something wrong?

498
00:32:45,167 --> 00:32:46,300
Hello

499
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:48,433
I am Wang Chunpei, whom I had an appointment to meet today.

500
00:32:53,400 --> 00:32:54,700
hateful

501
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,933
That girl is really...

502
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,800
Those who want to get married should go on their own blind dates

503
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:02,267
Come on, mom!

504
00:33:02,267 --> 00:33:03,900
Help me find a stepfather.

505
00:33:04,733 --> 00:33:06,467
Can I sit down?

506
00:33:08,167 --> 00:33:11,200
I just had my knee drained today.

507
00:33:12,733 --> 00:33:14,200
That girl is really...

508
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:18,133
Are you crazy?

509
00:33:19,733 --> 00:33:21,300
Stinky girl

510
00:33:21,300 --> 00:33:22,800
hateful

511
00:33:26,767 --> 00:33:28,300
Thank you so much

512
00:33:28,967 --> 00:33:31,467
You should have seen my mom's expression.

513
00:33:32,467 --> 00:33:33,933
The company is in turmoil, right?

514
00:33:34,767 --> 00:33:37,300
She said she would sue us.

515
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:40,833
Don't worry, she's really

516
00:33:40,833 --> 00:33:43,133
My friend will help me solve it.

517
00:33:44,700 --> 00:33:46,467
but…

518
00:33:47,867 --> 00:33:51,700
Why is your relationship with your mother so bad?

519
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:55,367
I don't know, I seem to have hated my mother since I was born.

520
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,600
My mom probably hates me too.

521
00:33:59,267 --> 00:34:02,733
No, auntie really cares about you.

522
00:34:05,767 --> 00:34:08,067
You know what my mom hates the most?

523
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:12,033
My dad

524
00:34:12,033 --> 00:34:14,300
But I'm exactly like my dad.

525
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,133
Whether it's appearance or personality

526
00:34:16,967 --> 00:34:19,067
But it really makes me angry

527
00:34:19,067 --> 00:34:22,500
My dad still loved my mom when he left.

528
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:24,133
This is really infuriating.

529
00:34:30,967 --> 00:34:32,467
What type of man do you like?

530
00:34:32,467 --> 00:34:35,500
Tell me the details and I'll help you find it.

531
00:34:37,200 --> 00:34:39,200
I'm telling you about my unfortunate family history.

532
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,433
Are you still thinking about achieving results at this time?

533
00:34:43,267 --> 00:34:45,067
It's really not that good

534
00:34:45,067 --> 00:34:46,567
etc.

535
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:54,400
I came to work at the marriage agency with a realization

536
00:34:55,033 --> 00:34:57,000
If the reason for the customer complaint

537
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:59,400
Not because of conditions but because of love

538
00:34:59,400 --> 00:35:02,200
No matter what the situation, you must be responsible to the end

539
00:35:04,567 --> 00:35:06,400
I will do my best to help you

540
00:35:08,867 --> 00:35:10,233
I am very satisfied

541
00:35:11,233 --> 00:35:13,100
I'll be off work soon.

542
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,600
Do you have a date?

543
00:35:40,700 --> 00:35:42,800
Is there anyone accompanying you, old man?

544
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:44,767
No, I came here by myself.

545
00:35:46,133 --> 00:35:48,100
Let me explain how to shoot

546
00:35:48,100 --> 00:35:49,400
plz follow me

547
00:35:54,033 --> 00:35:55,333
Please come over

548
00:35:57,233 --> 00:35:58,767
Sit here

549
00:35:58,767 --> 00:36:00,833
Camera in front

550
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:04,567
Just press this button to shoot

551
00:36:04,900 --> 00:36:06,333
good

552
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,200
Come again next time

553
00:37:06,333 --> 00:37:07,967
father-in-law and son-in-law

554
00:37:07,967 --> 00:37:08,867
Are you doing well?

555
00:37:08,867 --> 00:37:11,367
Didn't you say you would come?

556
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,233
Come in

557
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,200
Wife

558
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,600
Father-in-law is here

559
00:37:17,867 --> 00:37:19,033
dad

560
00:37:19,867 --> 00:37:20,933
my daughter

561
00:37:22,267 --> 00:37:24,133
But what is this

562
00:37:24,133 --> 00:37:26,133
I went to take the remains.

563
00:37:26,133 --> 00:37:28,067
Dad, father-in-law

564
00:37:28,067 --> 00:37:32,000
It is popular to take photos when you are healthy.

565
00:37:33,667 --> 00:37:34,967
Come and see

566
00:37:43,233 --> 00:37:46,000
Look, this dress fits me well.

567
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,700
I just want to say it out loud

568
00:37:49,533 --> 00:37:50,767
This

569
00:37:53,867 --> 00:37:55,467
Didn't the photographer say anything?

570
00:37:55,467 --> 00:37:58,867
I went to a selfie studio because I was afraid the photographer would talk.

571
00:37:58,867 --> 00:38:00,067
Is watermelon sweet?

572
00:38:00,067 --> 00:38:02,333
Why don't you contact me first so I can pick you up?

573
00:38:02,333 --> 00:38:04,433
You treat me like an old man again.

574
00:38:04,433 --> 00:38:06,167
Why bother answering?

575
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:09,167
Bring me something to drink.

576
00:38:09,167 --> 00:38:10,333
yes

577
00:38:10,333 --> 00:38:11,733
Oh, my father-in-law

578
00:38:11,733 --> 00:38:13,667
Are you going to stay here tonight?

579
00:38:13,667 --> 00:38:14,800
Take another look

580
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:18,067
It's been so long since I last came here, let's have a fight

581
00:38:18,067 --> 00:38:19,433
We agreed to stay here overnight.

582
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:21,000
This kid

583
00:38:46,433 --> 00:38:47,667
mom

584
00:39:00,300 --> 00:39:01,933
What happened to my daughter?

585
00:39:05,233 --> 00:39:07,133
Why take this kind of photo?

586
00:39:07,133 --> 00:39:09,600
Do you have to leave such an unpleasant photo?

587
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:11,767
How can it be unbearable? It's romantic

588
00:39:13,033 --> 00:39:14,333
Is Zhien okay?

589
00:39:16,367 --> 00:39:17,900
have no idea

590
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,800
Probably just pretending to be nice.

591
00:39:23,500 --> 00:39:26,000
I'll go meet her.

592
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:27,067
I'm different from you

593
00:39:27,067 --> 00:39:29,833
The way of handling the problem is very cool

594
00:39:29,833 --> 00:39:34,967
Why did you say you were actually my grandmother after we met?

595
00:39:34,967 --> 00:39:36,200
no

596
00:39:36,200 --> 00:39:37,667
Am I crazy?

597
00:39:38,833 --> 00:39:41,533
You know Zhihui looks a lot like you, right?

598
00:39:41,533 --> 00:39:43,600
Her nickname in this life is crazy

599
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:48,300
She's a little crazy

600
00:39:52,167 --> 00:39:54,333
I only realized it when I became a mother myself

601
00:39:55,300 --> 00:39:57,167
Mom, you worked really hard.

602
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:02,067
Just being a mother is hard work.

603
00:40:09,867 --> 00:40:13,233
Our Zhien doesn't know how kind he is.

604
00:40:13,233 --> 00:40:14,967
What should my husband do?

605
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:21,233
My husband ran away and was blamed by my daughter

606
00:40:26,467 --> 00:40:28,067
How did Mom survive?

607
00:40:29,567 --> 00:40:31,333
I'm old now and I've forgotten everything.

608
00:40:32,167 --> 00:40:33,367
Hello…

609
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:38,200
Wow, this color is really beautiful

610
00:40:39,933 --> 00:40:41,033
Mom, you too...

611
00:40:42,133 --> 00:40:43,833
Have you ever had such thoughts?

612
00:40:44,767 --> 00:40:46,133
I hope before I die

613
00:40:49,433 --> 00:40:51,900
It's good to turn back into a woman once

614
00:40:56,833 --> 00:40:58,133
If it weren't for Zhi En

615
00:40:59,667 --> 00:41:01,933
I probably won't tell it until I die.

616
00:41:05,667 --> 00:41:07,000
Of course I think about it every day

617
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:14,033
Then Zhien must be lying too.

618
00:41:18,933 --> 00:41:19,900
Great Grace

619
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:34,333
Great Grace

620
00:41:59,333 --> 00:42:00,467
Greatest Grace

621
00:42:17,133 --> 00:42:18,433
Mom, I'm sorry.

622
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,000
Let's talk about it later

623
00:42:26,767 --> 00:42:28,167
Great Grace

624
00:42:28,167 --> 00:42:29,600
Talk to Dad

625
00:42:34,300 --> 00:42:35,833
Does Dad know about this too?

626
00:42:37,067 --> 00:42:39,467
Did you already know that grandpa was a girl and not a boy?

627
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,800
Great Grace

628
00:42:48,800 --> 00:42:51,067
Your parents did nothing wrong.

629
00:42:58,833 --> 00:43:00,300
Me and my sister

630
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,967
The person I called grandpa all my life turned out to be grandma

631
00:43:07,467 --> 00:43:09,533
Are parents really not at fault at all?

632
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:12,800
sorry

633
00:43:13,833 --> 00:43:15,933
This is what Grandpa asked them to do...

634
00:43:15,933 --> 00:43:17,900
You're not grandpa.

635
00:43:20,600 --> 00:43:21,833
sorry

636
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:23,100
no…

637
00:43:26,433 --> 00:43:28,800
How long are you going to keep this secret from us?

638
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:32,700
At least you should have told me when I became a boy

639
00:43:33,633 --> 00:43:35,467
Tell me maybe...

640
00:43:38,767 --> 00:43:40,900
I have to be a boy all my life

641
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:44,400
Even if my parents can't say it

642
00:43:45,267 --> 00:43:46,333
Grandpa...

643
00:43:49,967 --> 00:43:51,800
Grandma should have told me too.

644
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,533
This is all my fault

645
00:43:57,533 --> 00:43:58,800
Sorry, daughter

646
00:43:59,900 --> 00:44:02,400
No, Dad, I'm sorry.

647
00:44:04,267 --> 00:44:05,233
Great Grace

648
00:44:05,233 --> 00:44:06,733
I want to go on my own today

649
00:44:08,167 --> 00:44:09,400
Give me some time

650
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:11,233
(My Yunzai)

651
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,233
(My Yunzai)

652
00:45:57,367 --> 00:45:59,300
This is a high-end wine that someone gave me.

653
00:45:59,300 --> 00:46:01,067
I don't have a glass suitable for drinking it.

654
00:46:01,967 --> 00:46:04,467
It doesn't matter if it looks ordinary on the surface, the content is what matters

655
00:46:04,467 --> 00:46:07,633
Oh my god, you seem to be a good match for me.

656
00:46:07,633 --> 00:46:08,667
cheers

657
00:46:17,933 --> 00:46:19,733
This is delicious.

658
00:46:19,733 --> 00:46:20,967
Really

659
00:46:20,967 --> 00:46:23,433
I may not be used to drinking this kind of drink. It feels a bit bitter.

660
00:46:24,100 --> 00:46:27,900
But alcohol is something you get used to after drinking it for a long time.

661
00:46:30,300 --> 00:46:32,800
So, what type of person do you like?

662
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:36,100
I decided to provide you with after-sales service

663
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:37,300
Just say it

664
00:46:38,333 --> 00:46:39,967
Although I first glance

665
00:46:39,967 --> 00:46:44,133
Maybe she's a vulgar woman who only looks at conditions

666
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:45,867
But when faced with love

667
00:46:45,867 --> 00:46:48,967
But it will become very humble

668
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:52,700
I will become humble in the face of love

669
00:46:53,167 --> 00:46:54,800
I like this sentence

670
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:57,133
but

671
00:46:57,133 --> 00:46:59,700
Actually, I have someone I like.

672
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:01,667
I have also introduced it to my parents

673
00:47:02,733 --> 00:47:05,567
Oh my god it's so good

674
00:47:05,567 --> 00:47:07,567
So are you single?

675
00:47:08,833 --> 00:47:11,000
Now it is indeed

676
00:47:11,667 --> 00:47:14,067
But I also have someone I like

677
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:16,767
No, I finally found it.

678
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,467
Did you find it?

679
00:47:20,033 --> 00:47:21,600
My first love

680
00:47:23,500 --> 00:47:25,300
I've kept him in my heart for the past ten years.

681
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:27,033
We finally met recently

682
00:47:27,333 --> 00:47:28,733
So cute

683
00:47:30,900 --> 00:47:33,600
If your love blossoms and bears fruit

684
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,300
Sister, I will help you with your wedding.

685
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:37,667
I'll record it, sis.

686
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:40,367
I'll even send you on a honeymoon.

687
00:47:41,833 --> 00:47:43,000
Look at this sister

688
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:46,400
It turns out to be a big deal.

689
00:47:47,067 --> 00:47:47,967
If you develop well

690
00:47:47,967 --> 00:47:50,700
I will sing your wedding song for you

691
00:47:50,700 --> 00:47:52,767
I originally wanted to invite a symphony orchestra

692
00:47:52,767 --> 00:47:54,867
I didn't expect that I could save money and someone would come to help me sing.

693
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:01,100
I'm sorry because it might be a company matter.

694
00:48:01,100 --> 00:48:02,433
You are free

695
00:48:03,433 --> 00:48:06,800
(Hong Yingshuo
Obituary of the deceased: Hong Zhong (preface)

696
00:48:09,933 --> 00:48:11,467
What should I do?

697
00:48:11,467 --> 00:48:13,733
I suddenly have something urgent to deal with.

698
00:48:13,733 --> 00:48:16,167
Maybe I have to go first.

699
00:48:16,167 --> 00:48:18,100
Is this the company's contact?

700
00:48:18,100 --> 00:48:19,667
Is it because of my mom?

701
00:48:19,667 --> 00:48:21,000
no

702
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:25,033
Dad passed away

703
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:27,433
Yeah

704
00:48:27,433 --> 00:48:28,500
That…

705
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:30,500
I'll go with you and wait for me.

706
00:48:30,500 --> 00:48:32,400
Not my dad

707
00:48:32,400 --> 00:48:34,400
My friend's father

708
00:48:34,400 --> 00:48:36,633
That first love

709
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,900
Oh my god

710
00:48:38,900 --> 00:48:40,433
You should go over there quickly

711
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,967
I'll contact you later, Sister Zhengci.

712
00:48:46,267 --> 00:48:47,533
Excuse me

713
00:49:06,433 --> 00:49:07,667
Scare me

714
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:10,733
what are you doing here

715
00:49:12,567 --> 00:49:13,833
What's wrong with you, Ji-hoon?

716
00:49:15,800 --> 00:49:18,167
Oh my god, are you okay?

717
00:49:18,167 --> 00:49:19,367
I'm fine

718
00:49:19,367 --> 00:49:21,133
It looks bad.

719
00:49:21,133 --> 00:49:23,133
What are you still doing here?

720
00:49:23,133 --> 00:49:24,533
Can you stand up?

721
00:49:26,067 --> 00:49:27,633
one two three

722
00:49:30,100 --> 00:49:31,233
careful

723
00:49:31,900 --> 00:49:33,267
how so

724
00:49:35,733 --> 00:49:37,400
This won't work.

725
00:49:37,400 --> 00:49:38,867
I called an ambulance.

726
00:49:38,867 --> 00:49:40,433
no

727
00:49:40,433 --> 00:49:42,200
I'm fine

728
00:49:42,200 --> 00:49:43,233
I am fine

729
00:49:43,233 --> 00:49:45,667
You need to go to the emergency room.

730
00:49:45,667 --> 00:49:47,300
I can't go to the hospital

731
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:48,667
I'm fine

732
00:49:48,667 --> 00:49:50,633
Why can't I go? I can't stand it.

733
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:52,233
Is this here?

734
00:49:52,233 --> 00:49:54,133
Oh, Brother Zhixun

735
00:49:55,967 --> 00:49:56,900
Brother Zhixun

736
00:49:57,667 --> 00:49:58,733
Brother Zhixun

737
00:49:59,633 --> 00:50:00,967
Zhixun, wake up!

738
00:50:01,733 --> 00:50:03,333
Zhixun, wake up!

739
00:50:04,300 --> 00:50:05,400
what to do

740
00:50:23,167 --> 00:50:24,933
He couldn't have surgery in the first place.

741
00:50:24,933 --> 00:50:26,567
Just being alive is a miracle

742
00:50:28,200 --> 00:50:29,967
But how could it be so easy in just one day...

743
00:50:30,867 --> 00:50:32,867
Living in the world

744
00:50:32,867 --> 00:50:34,700
You will know that compared to natural death

745
00:50:34,700 --> 00:50:37,467
Sudden death is more common

746
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,733
But your dad...

747
00:50:39,733 --> 00:50:41,433
Than leaving suddenly

748
00:50:41,433 --> 00:50:44,400
That's given us a lot of time.

749
00:50:49,167 --> 00:50:50,400
Uncle is here

750
00:50:50,400 --> 00:50:52,933
You are here

751
00:50:52,933 --> 00:50:54,433
You guys are here...

752
00:50:54,433 --> 00:50:57,100
What's going on?

753
00:50:58,733 --> 00:51:00,100
I'm so sorry.

754
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:02,167
how so

755
00:51:41,467 --> 00:51:43,400
He was already sick.

756
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:46,800
I didn't know I'd leave so soon.

757
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:51,433
Zhihui, thank you for coming.

758
00:51:53,500 --> 00:51:55,333
This is what I should do

759
00:51:56,800 --> 00:51:57,667
mom

760
00:51:57,667 --> 00:52:01,033
She is my high school deskmate Zhihui

761
00:52:01,033 --> 00:52:03,133
Thank you for coming all the way here

762
00:52:03,133 --> 00:52:04,567
Won't

763
00:52:07,633 --> 00:52:08,667
Zhengci is here

764
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:10,867
Aunt Zhengci

765
00:52:11,933 --> 00:52:18,200
Thank you…

766
00:52:18,200 --> 00:52:20,767
Why are you here?

767
00:52:20,767 --> 00:52:23,267
It's all thanks to you

768
00:52:24,733 --> 00:52:27,133
I really want to come in.

769
00:52:28,833 --> 00:52:31,067
Oh my God, wisdom

770
00:52:34,967 --> 00:52:38,333
But I actually have someone I like.

771
00:52:38,333 --> 00:52:40,967
I have also introduced it to my parents

772
00:52:45,367 --> 00:52:48,500
Dad passed away

773
00:52:48,500 --> 00:52:50,633
Not my dad

774
00:52:50,633 --> 00:52:53,233
My friend's father

775
00:52:53,233 --> 00:52:55,233
That first love

776
00:53:13,867 --> 00:53:15,367
fortunately

777
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:17,467
The fever has subsided

778
00:53:21,767 --> 00:53:25,200
I don't think he's a bad guy.

779
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,567
Why can't you go to the hospital?

780
00:53:55,467 --> 00:53:57,033
don't want

781
00:54:00,267 --> 00:54:02,767
I don't want to live like this

782
00:54:04,133 --> 00:54:05,600
mom

783
00:54:09,467 --> 00:54:10,900
mom…

784
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,733
So cold

785
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,900
So to sum up

786
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:29,167
Do we like the same person?

787
00:55:30,633 --> 00:55:34,633
Yingshuo doesn't know I like him

788
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:37,933
I hope you don't misunderstand

789
00:55:40,567 --> 00:55:41,400
What is the misunderstanding?

790
00:55:41,400 --> 00:55:43,933
You've met his parents.

791
00:55:43,933 --> 00:55:45,767
I hope it's not because of what I said

792
00:55:45,767 --> 00:55:49,233
Cause a rift between you

793
00:55:49,233 --> 00:55:51,133
We just met by chance

794
00:55:51,133 --> 00:55:52,633
Nothing

795
00:55:52,633 --> 00:55:54,833
We were connected by the work-study students.

796
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:57,167
We are just in the stage of getting to know each other.

797
00:55:57,167 --> 00:56:00,967
Although I have met my parents, that is for another reason.

798
00:56:01,800 --> 00:56:07,100
I didn't mean to get in your way at all.

799
00:56:07,100 --> 00:56:08,967
It is said that people will be very humble when facing love

800
00:56:08,967 --> 00:56:10,533
Is that really the case?

801
00:56:10,533 --> 00:56:12,433
You haven't committed any crime

802
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:18,600
Yingshuo is really a good person

803
00:56:18,600 --> 00:56:22,067
Simple and honest

804
00:56:22,067 --> 00:56:24,000
Still handsome

805
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:25,633
I know too

806
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:29,233
But the person who decides the relationship

807
00:56:29,233 --> 00:56:32,100
No, we are Yingshuo

808
00:56:33,067 --> 00:56:35,400
Let's not decide for ourselves

809
00:56:35,400 --> 00:56:37,133
Let's do our best.

810
00:56:37,133 --> 00:56:38,633
Whether he falls in love with one of them

811
00:56:38,633 --> 00:56:40,633
Or neither of them loves

812
00:56:40,633 --> 00:56:42,900
Yingshuo will decide for himself

813
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,567
Because I hate competition

814
00:56:45,567 --> 00:56:48,933
So I don't study or exercise.

815
00:56:48,933 --> 00:56:51,633
But I will attend this time

816
00:56:52,533 --> 00:56:55,500
Because you are a worthy competitor.

817
00:56:57,433 --> 00:56:59,600
My advantage is that I have a lot of money

818
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:02,700
And you

819
00:57:07,967 --> 00:57:09,400
remember

820
00:57:10,200 --> 00:57:12,733
The battle between money and time

821
00:57:15,133 --> 00:57:17,533
This is a bit disadvantageous to me.

822
00:57:17,533 --> 00:57:18,900
My sister is very beautiful.

823
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,600
You are young

824
00:57:28,300 --> 00:57:30,367
The door is open

825
00:57:30,367 --> 00:57:33,200
I'll call you after I confirm.

826
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:34,400
good

827
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:57,400
Yun Jae

828
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:00,433
you…

829
00:58:00,433 --> 00:58:02,200
What's going on?

830
00:58:02,200 --> 00:58:03,733
What

831
00:58:10,167 --> 00:58:12,133
that is…

832
00:58:12,133 --> 00:58:13,567
Yunzai

833
00:58:14,800 --> 00:58:16,233
How did you get here?

834
00:58:21,267 --> 00:58:25,233
So why are you sleeping next to me?

835
00:58:25,233 --> 00:58:27,233
Why are you asking me?

836
00:58:28,000 --> 00:58:30,167
Are you pulling my hair now?

837
00:58:30,167 --> 00:58:31,800
Aren't you letting go yet?

838
00:58:31,800 --> 00:58:33,133
Let go, you let go first

839
00:58:33,133 --> 00:58:34,667
You let go first.

840
00:58:34,667 --> 00:58:39,233
Wait a minute, you two...won't you let go?

841
00:58:39,700 --> 00:58:41,233
Jiang Minzhou, you vixen

842
00:58:41,233 --> 00:58:43,133
Do you want to be killed by a vixen?

843
00:58:43,133 --> 00:58:44,567
Wait a moment

844
00:58:44,567 --> 00:58:46,600
Let go

845
00:58:46,600 --> 00:58:47,333
Communicate with your mouth

846
00:58:47,333 --> 00:58:48,167
This is my home

847
00:58:48,167 --> 00:58:49,467
How could I sleep here?

848
00:58:49,467 --> 00:58:50,867
Fuck me

849
00:58:50,867 --> 00:58:52,967
Let me go, why would I be so rude to you?

850
00:58:52,967 --> 00:58:54,967
Come over here and fight to the death

851
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:57,433
Wait a minute, you two...

852
00:58:57,433 --> 00:58:58,700
Get lost

853
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,033
Are you crazy?

854
00:59:02,033 --> 00:59:05,300
Wait a minute, you two...

855
00:59:05,300 --> 00:59:09,300
Wait a moment…

856
00:59:13,433 --> 00:59:17,267
(Thanks for the special appearance
Yoon Joo-sang, Kang Shin-il, Park Myung-shin, Jung Kyung-soon)

857
00:59:22,133 --> 00:59:24,067
"Cause I love you"

858
00:59:24,067 --> 00:59:27,367
"Would you like to tell me?"

859
00:59:27,367 --> 00:59:31,167
"Will you express your throbbing feelings?"

860
00:59:31,900 --> 00:59:37,100
"I always laugh for no reason."

861
00:59:37,100 --> 00:59:40,633
"It's all because of you"

862
00:59:41,533 --> 00:59:44,333
"Can you hear my heartbeat?"

863
00:59:44,333 --> 00:59:46,133
"Leaping towards you"

864
00:59:46,133 --> 00:59:50,400
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

865
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:52,667
I work on the boat on weekends.

866
00:59:52,667 --> 00:59:55,667
I told my grandfather to work hard.

867
00:59:55,667 --> 00:59:56,433
Are you okay?

868
00:59:56,433 --> 00:59:57,967
Brother, go with me

869
00:59:57,967 --> 01:00:00,667
Have you really never thought of me as a woman?

870
01:00:00,667 --> 01:00:03,300
Have you two kissed?

871
01:00:03,300 --> 01:00:04,967
It's better to be angry

872
01:00:04,967 --> 01:00:06,400
Like the original Kim Ji-eun

873
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:08,533
Anyone who sees this will know that I am not Kim Ji-eun

874
01:00:08,533 --> 01:00:10,600
How can I do what Jin Zhien would do in this state?

875
01:00:10,600 --> 01:00:13,867
I should break up with Yun Jae.

876
01:00:13,867 --> 01:00:16,000
At least at this moment

877
01:00:16,000 --> 01:00:18,333
No one cares about you more than I do.
