What touched you most was
The Birth and Death of the Universe

35
00:03:55.233 --> 00:04:00.100
My boyfriend, who is studying astronomy, recommended me

36
00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:04.167
I read the novel The Birth and Death of the Universe

37
00:04:06.133 --> 00:04:09.133
Connect the character of the universe with the real universe

I read it several times

40
00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.900
(Ji-eun and Yun-jae's hiking schedule)
I finally understood the meaning of this book.

41
00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:20.100
What is it

42
00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.000
Love is Love

43
00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.200
It's the beginning of all events

44
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.400
Judging from the contents of the book

45
00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:33.033
All events are caused by the protagonist falling in love with someone

46
00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:37.833
If he doesn't love, nothing will happen.

47
00:04:37.833 --> 00:04:41.133
So let’s be brave and love today

48
00:04:41.133 --> 00:04:42.900
Keep loving

53
00:05:18.067 --> 00:05:19.267
How did you get here?

54
00:05:19.267 --> 00:05:20.600
Take the bus

55
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.167
This place is huge

56
00:05:22.167 --> 00:05:24.867
Thanks to Jin Zhien, I have the opportunity to come to this place

57
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.100
I knew you were going to say your feet would hurt if you wore these.

58
00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.200

59
00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.367

64

Hey, what if someone hears this?

87
00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:30.100
- It hurts.
- That's a really old-fashioned way of saying it.

88
00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.533
- Why do that?
- I'm just looking at the stars, what's wrong?

89
00:07:32.533 --> 00:07:34.233
Stop talking.

90
00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.033
I still have food in my mouth...

91
00:07:39.033 --> 00:07:40.467

95

The weather is so hot, come in and kiss me

96
00:08:35.467 --> 00:08:37.833
Can't you just pretend you didn't see it and go in?

97
00:08:37.833 --> 00:08:39.867
No, isn't it better to do it in a cool place?

98
00:08:39.867 --> 00:08:42.133
More comfortable

99
00:08:43.433 --> 00:08:47.333

100

Come in quickly. I'm leaving first.

101
00:08:54.733 --> 00:08:56.967
My sister is driving me crazy

102
00:08:56.967 --> 00:08:59.433
I'm leaving. I'll call you later.

103
00:08:59.433 --> 00:09:01.133
Why do you come in and continue?

104
00:09:01.133 --> 00:09:02.233
I will stay in the room

105
00:09:02.233 --> 00:09:04.367
What nonsense!

106
00:09:04.367 --> 00:09:06.367
- I asked you to come in and continue.
-goodbye

107
00:09:06.367 --> 00:09:07.833
Why are you doing this?

108
00:09:07.833 --> 00:09:09.400
Ask him to come in and kiss him

109
00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.267
When was this given to me?

110
00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.033
You'll die if you drink all of it.

111
00:09:28.033 --> 00:09:31.767
Isn't that great?
You won't get old and you don't need to make money

112
00:09:31.767 --> 00:09:35.433
My parents will be pissed off when they hear this.

113
00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:40.200
You are here again

114
00:09:41.133 --> 00:09:42.900
What's wrong? Is there anything wrong?

115
00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:45.667
What kind of question is this? When did your sister get well?

116
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.433
If you want to do this, just turn it all over.

117
00:09:52.433 --> 00:09:56.600
It's faster to look at the pattern.

118
00:09:58.233 --> 00:09:59.367
Oh my god

119
00:09:59.367 --> 00:10:02.600
This is the first time I picked this card

120
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:07.367

Hey, what are you doing?

128
00:10:46.533 --> 00:10:48.167
Can you knock on the door?

129
00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.533
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

130
00:10:53.533 --> 00:10:55.167
There are so many tricks

131
00:10:57.867 --> 00:10:58.900

132
00:10:58.900 --> 00:10:59.933
Take a look

133
00:10:59.933 --> 00:11:01.733
Have my shoulders become broader?

134
00:11:04.733 --> 00:11:06.200
The shit is about to come out

135
00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:07.600
Take a look

136
00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:11.800
How about it

137
00:11:13.733 --> 00:11:16.267
It seems to have widened.

138
00:11:17.067 --> 00:11:18.433
but…

139
00:11:18.433 --> 00:11:19.467
But what

140
00:11:19.467 --> 00:11:21.867
The face seems to have become wider as well.

141
00:11:21.867 --> 00:11:23.267
Don't waste your energy.

142
00:11:29.767 --> 00:11:31.333

148
00:12:19.233 --> 00:12:22.367
Is this situation in the store okay?

149
00:12:27.700 --> 00:12:32.733
Work-study student, do you know the name of this building?

150
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.033
I seem to know

00:12:35.033 --> 00:12:36.800
(Sadako Building)

152
00:12:38.100 --> 00:12:39.567
Sadako Building

153
00:12:39.567 --> 00:12:41.900
A very memorable name so I remember it.

154
00:12:43.333 --> 00:12:44.833
etc.

155
00:12:44.833 --> 00:12:46.733
The boss lady has the same name as you.

156
00:12:46.733 --> 00:12:48.833
My mother took it.

157
00:12:48.833 --> 00:12:51.833
My name and the building's name are

158
00:12:53.833 --> 00:12:55.533
So the boss lady

159
00:12:55.533 --> 00:12:58.800
Are you the legendary landlord's daughter?

160
00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:15.267
Damn deadlines

161
00:13:18.033 --> 00:13:22.067
Yuli Writer, Where Are You?

162
00:13:24.933 --> 00:13:26.233
Not here

163
00:13:34.233 --> 00:13:35.133
I was scared to death

164
00:13:35.967 --> 00:13:37.067
What are you doing?

165
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:39.633
The deadline is approaching

166
00:13:40.333 --> 00:13:43.767
But I'm totally uninspired so I'm punishing myself

167
00:13:45.500 --> 00:13:46.733
Great Grace

168
00:13:48.867 --> 00:13:52.000
I really don't seem to have the qualifications to be a writer

169
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.400
Really…

170
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:55.133
Come out quickly.

171
00:13:55.133 --> 00:13:57.800
What is a two-day and one-night trip?

172
00:13:58.733 --> 00:14:01.233
My friend was in a life-or-death situation due to deadlines

173
00:14:01.233 --> 00:14:02.900
Are you going on a trip with your boyfriend?

174
00:14:04.433 --> 00:14:06.967
No wonder some people say making friends is useless

175
00:14:06.967 --> 00:14:09.867
But speaking of traveling…

176
00:14:09.867 --> 00:14:13.433
It seems like Yoon Jae has done a lot of preparation

177
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.533
I feel a little sorry that I was only responsible for being there

178
00:14:16.533 --> 00:14:18.667
What's wrong with just being there?

179
00:14:18.667 --> 00:14:20.467
That's the most important thing.

180
00:14:20.467 --> 00:14:21.733
What's the meaning

181
00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:23.667
Wait me a moment

182
00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:31.533
this…

183
00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:34.533
What is this?

184
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:38.300
You have to protect your own body

185
00:14:40.133 --> 00:14:42.867
Hey, what are you thinking about?

186
00:14:42.867 --> 00:14:44.433
We didn't do that.

Adult men and women who love each other to death

188
00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.767
We're going on a trip together.

189
00:14:48.767 --> 00:14:50.933
Is it possible not to do that?

190
00:14:50.933 --> 00:14:52.900
Of course it is...

191
00:14:52.900 --> 00:14:54.333
The purpose of this journey

192
00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:56.633
The Long Night

193
00:14:56.633 --> 00:14:58.533
I want to pick stars with you

194
00:15:05.500 --> 00:15:07.033
Compared to temporary can not find

195
00:15:07.033 --> 00:15:08.967
It's safer to carry it with you.

196
00:15:10.367 --> 00:15:11.633
Put it in your bag quickly

197
00:15:17.300 --> 00:15:18.700
but…

198
00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:21.800
How can you, a single woman, have such a thing?

199
00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:23.500
I am a person who writes a suicide note every day

200
00:15:23.933 --> 00:15:26.133
I might die tomorrow.

201
00:15:26.133 --> 00:15:27.533
What's the point of preparing a condom?

202
00:15:27.967 --> 00:15:30.867
I wish I was that proactive in submitting my manuscript.

203
00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:34.433

205
00:15:37.167 --> 00:15:39.033
It's written so well yet you still sigh.

This Choi Yu-ri has the talent of a devil

(Nyver College Student Online Novel Competition)

208
00:15:56.967 --> 00:15:58.133
Hey Yun Jae

209
00:16:01.933 --> 00:16:03.800
How come there is this car?

210
00:16:05.167 --> 00:16:08.067
It's actually our boss lady's.

211
00:16:08.067 --> 00:16:10.067
I said I wanted to travel with you, so she lent it to me.

212
00:16:10.067 --> 00:16:10.967
Great, right?

213
00:16:10.967 --> 00:16:12.767
The cafe owner?

214
00:16:13.700 --> 00:16:15.300
but…

215
00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.167
How could such an expensive car be sold for nothing?
Lend it to working students

216
00:16:19.833 --> 00:16:23.533
Is it because I am usually hardworking and honest?

217
00:16:24.833 --> 00:16:28.300
But what if it gets scratched?

218
00:16:28.300 --> 00:16:29.600
Very uneasy

219
00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:31.067
Leave it to me

220
00:16:32.867 --> 00:16:35.067
And even if you’re uneasy…

221
00:16:35.767 --> 00:16:38.633
The transaction is complete and there is no going back.

222
00:16:39.300 --> 00:16:41.500
What about the landlord's daughter?

223
00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:42.933
I don't have a boyfriend.

224
00:16:45.867 --> 00:16:49.533
The boss's wife's real estate is much better than my boyfriend's.

225
00:16:49.533 --> 00:16:52.500
Really? Then do you want to date me?

226
00:16:52.500 --> 00:16:55.700
Once I own it, I own the building.

227
00:17:00.733 --> 00:17:03.400
I suddenly thought of a brother I knew

228
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.867
Is he handsome?

229
00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.500
Although this is a photo from five years ago

230
00:17:09.500 --> 00:17:12.033
But he's really handsome.

231
00:17:12.033 --> 00:17:14.967
Not only is she tall, but her voice is also very attractive.

232
00:17:14.967 --> 00:17:16.833
The hardware is pretty good.

233
00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.667
But the boss lady

234
00:17:20.667 --> 00:17:22.667
This brother is still unemployed

235
00:17:22.667 --> 00:17:24.067
Give me the number

236
00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:29.700
Wow, it turns out your boss lady is also a member of the Appearance Association

237
00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.267
Exactly like my sister

238
00:17:31.933 --> 00:17:33.833
Yes, your sister too.

239
00:17:33.833 --> 00:17:36.033
She should have been more anxious.

240
00:17:37.100 --> 00:17:38.167
That's right

241
00:17:42.267 --> 00:17:44.700
I don't think we'll be interrupted today.

242
00:17:48.567 --> 00:17:52.567
My sister drank a lot yesterday and is now lying down

243
00:18:07.667 --> 00:18:09.533
Come in and kiss me

244
00:18:16.833 --> 00:18:18.900
How are you, sister Zhien?

245
00:18:19.533 --> 00:18:21.167
Are you a pervert?

246
00:18:21.167 --> 00:18:22.467
Why do you keep peeping?

247
00:18:22.467 --> 00:18:25.533
Who told you to be so conspicuous? Otherwise, just be more restrained.

248
00:18:26.367 --> 00:18:29.067
What's in your hand?

249
00:18:29.067 --> 00:18:30.967
Is that a cigarette?

250
00:18:30.967 --> 00:18:32.633
Are you smoking again?

251
00:18:32.633 --> 00:18:34.400
Be careful or I'll tell dad about it

252
00:18:35.633 --> 00:18:38.167
This is a cotton swab.

253
00:18:39.800 --> 00:18:41.000
Really comfortable

254
00:18:41.467 --> 00:18:43.767
Okay, enjoy it slowly.

255
00:18:47.667 --> 00:18:49.100
Really…

256
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:11.533
It must be delicious

257
00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.533
Sit down

258
00:20:14.533 --> 00:20:16.867
What? Aren't you going camping?

259
00:20:16.867 --> 00:20:18.100
How is hair

260
00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:20.533
What do you mean? What happened?

261
00:20:22.233 --> 00:20:23.667
Did you wear perfume?

262
00:20:24.367 --> 00:20:25.767
Very suspicious

263
00:20:26.333 --> 00:20:28.700
I'm not suspicious at all, okay?

264
00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:30.933
- It's too suspicious.
- Stop bickering.

265
00:20:30.933 --> 00:20:32.233
Let’s eat first

266
00:20:32.967 --> 00:20:34.867
Husband, let's start

267
00:20:36.133 --> 00:20:37.500
Let’s pray together

268
00:20:39.867 --> 00:20:44.400
Today, our eldest son, Park Yun-jae
Going on a trip with my girlfriend

269
00:20:44.933 --> 00:20:48.633
I hope they have a safe and happy journey.

Amen

272
00:20:56.100 --> 00:20:58.833
Dad, wait, what are you talking about?

273
00:20:58.833 --> 00:21:00.600
Let’s get started

274
00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.300
-etc…
-Yoona...

275
00:21:02.300 --> 00:21:05.100
Have you inquired about the online novel writing academy?

276
00:21:05.100 --> 00:21:06.600
Yes, I'll go ask around later.

277
00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.367
Mom, wait a minute.

278
00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:09.767
Let me tell you first…

279
00:21:09.767 --> 00:21:11.267
Wife

280
00:21:11.267 --> 00:21:14.333
Today's soup is so refreshing. It's cooked so well.

281
00:21:16.167 --> 00:21:17.700
Yunzai, you eat more

282
00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.067
Eat enough to have strength

283
00:21:19.067 --> 00:21:20.433
Yes, eat more

284
00:21:20.433 --> 00:21:22.167
Eat some meat too

285
00:21:22.167 --> 00:21:24.067
- Eat more
-etc

286
00:21:24.067 --> 00:21:26.000
Why should I have strength?

287
00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.867
- Eat some meat
- Listen to me

288
00:21:29.867 --> 00:21:31.233
Parents

289
00:21:31.233 --> 00:21:33.400
I didn't do that.

290
00:21:34.267 --> 00:21:37.933
I really went camping.

291
00:22:56.667 --> 00:22:58.300
This is outrageous…

292
00:23:10.067 --> 00:23:11.600
what to do

293
00:23:15.633 --> 00:23:17.633
right

294
00:23:17.633 --> 00:23:19.133
I must be dreaming

295
00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:29.367
Why don't you knock on the door...

296
00:23:30.933 --> 00:23:33.000
Sorry, I'll be fine soon.

297
00:23:46.733 --> 00:23:49.733
Hey, your clothes are getting too small.

298
00:23:49.733 --> 00:23:51.500
My butt is about to get stuck

299
00:23:52.400 --> 00:23:53.833
LOL

300
00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:58.333
That's why I told you to use the dryer less.

301
00:23:59.667 --> 00:24:01.600
I think you've gained weight.

302
00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:40.867
Then I'll go out first.

303
00:24:48.300 --> 00:24:50.833
Who are you you pervert

304
00:24:50.833 --> 00:24:52.700
Where did you run from?

305
00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:55.100
Look at me, you little bastard

306
00:24:55.100 --> 00:24:58.433
-It's hot
- You pervert

307
00:24:59.167 --> 00:25:00.433
It's me

308
00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:02.333
It's me

309
00:25:02.333 --> 00:25:05.267
Help

310
00:25:05.267 --> 00:25:06.600
It's me

311
00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:10.200
Help!

312
00:25:32.667 --> 00:25:35.333
I am Zhien

313
00:25:35.333 --> 00:25:37.467
Jin Zhien, your sister

314
00:25:39.833 --> 00:25:42.200
I'm just a sister.

315
00:25:42.200 --> 00:25:44.700
I am that sister.

316
00:25:45.933 --> 00:25:47.333
I understand

317
00:25:47.333 --> 00:25:49.000
This is a dream, right?

318
00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:52.567
Since it's a dream, do you want to kiss me?

319
00:25:56.633 --> 00:25:58.867
Can you wake up a little?

320
00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.633
Sister, now I am in your eyes

321
00:26:05.633 --> 00:26:07.533
Looks like a boy, right?

322
00:26:07.533 --> 00:26:08.733
Sister?

323
00:26:10.233 --> 00:26:11.567
Look carefully

324
00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:14.633
I am Zhien

325
00:26:14.633 --> 00:26:16.500
Kim Chi-eun

326
00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.333
Your sister

327
00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:25.733
Great Grace…

328
00:26:27.967 --> 00:26:30.067
to…

329
00:26:35.333 --> 00:26:37.000
Great Grace

330
00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.367
Sister is here to save you

331
00:26:39.367 --> 00:26:41.733
Where are you?

332
00:26:41.733 --> 00:26:44.867
Zhien, where are you?

333
00:26:44.867 --> 00:26:46.533
Great Grace

334
00:26:50.067 --> 00:26:57.233
Because I was trained by my parents when I was a child

335
00:26:57.233 --> 00:27:00.633
I can tolerate this ridiculous situation now.

336
00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:03.633
But I'm actually thinking

337
00:27:03.633 --> 00:27:06.633
Should we call the police?

338
00:27:06.633 --> 00:27:08.367
If you want to call the police, go ahead.

339
00:27:08.367 --> 00:27:10.633
I also want to know what will happen

340
00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:16.300
Can you bring your legs together?

341
00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:25.633
To be honest

342
00:27:25.633 --> 00:27:28.200
Is this situation reasonable now?

343
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:30.567
My ordinary sister

344
00:27:30.567 --> 00:27:32.967
He became a flower boy overnight

345
00:27:32.967 --> 00:27:37.033
Where is your focus?

346
00:27:37.033 --> 00:27:40.833
The question is, can an ordinary little sister become a flower boy?

347
00:27:40.833 --> 00:27:43.433
No

348
00:27:43.433 --> 00:27:45.167
What I mean is

349
00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:51.000
Why are you so rude when you first meet me?

350
00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:55.800
That's right

351
00:27:57.700 --> 00:27:59.167
What on earth do you want to do?

352
00:27:59.167 --> 00:28:01.033
I really want to call the police

353
00:28:01.033 --> 00:28:03.533
Don't come near me I warned you

354
00:28:03.533 --> 00:28:05.333
- I'll really call the police
- Look at this

355
00:28:05.333 --> 00:28:06.667
Don't come over

356
00:28:06.667 --> 00:28:08.367
I really want to call the police

357
00:28:08.367 --> 00:28:10.433
Jin Zhihui, please look carefully

358
00:28:25.933 --> 00:28:27.700
Although it is unbelievable

359
00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:29.933
But if it's as my parents said

360
00:28:29.933 --> 00:28:32.633
We really had that happen.

361
00:28:32.633 --> 00:28:34.533
Let's confirm this first.

362
00:28:34.533 --> 00:28:35.967
After confirmation

363
00:28:35.967 --> 00:28:39.433
Support and believe in each other no matter what

364
00:28:39.433 --> 00:28:40.767
Until it is restored

365
00:28:40.767 --> 00:28:42.533
but

366
00:28:42.533 --> 00:28:44.733
What if this disappears too?

367
00:28:47.700 --> 00:28:49.967
I didn't consider this.

368
00:28:49.967 --> 00:28:52.067
We'll see what happens then.

369
00:28:52.067 --> 00:28:53.433
Do you know

370
00:28:53.433 --> 00:28:54.900
good

371
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.433
So cute

372
00:29:02.267 --> 00:29:03.900
Luckily this is still there

373
00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:08.100
Why do you have this tattoo on your shoulder?

374
00:29:08.100 --> 00:29:10.067
what do I do

375
00:29:10.067 --> 00:29:12.133
What should I do?

376
00:29:12.133 --> 00:29:13.200
That's ridiculous.

377
00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:16.100
I keep saying this is too outrageous

378
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.833
Are you really Kim Ji-eun?

379
00:29:17.833 --> 00:29:19.667
yes

380
00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.433
etc.

381
00:29:30.433 --> 00:29:32.800
What's wrong? It's scary.

382
00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:34.933
I really can't help it

383
00:29:36.133 --> 00:29:40.200
In fact, I have been enduring

384
00:29:42.767 --> 00:29:43.700
Oh my god

385
00:29:43.700 --> 00:29:45.067
Hey, no, really not.

386
00:29:45.067 --> 00:29:46.700
I can't

387
00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.500
what to do

388
00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:50.700
I want to go to the toilet

389
00:29:52.367 --> 00:29:53.833
what to do

390
00:29:53.833 --> 00:29:56.100
The one below is probably the boy's.

391
00:29:56.100 --> 00:29:58.100
I don't dare to see what to do

392
00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:00.367
Can you help me?

393
00:30:00.367 --> 00:30:01.767
Are you crazy?

394
00:30:01.767 --> 00:30:03.600
I have to pee

395
00:30:03.600 --> 00:30:05.333
Letting go

396
00:30:05.333 --> 00:30:07.033
OMG

397
00:30:07.033 --> 00:30:09.467
How can I help you go to the toilet?

398
00:30:17.833 --> 00:30:19.100
For you

399
00:30:20.133 --> 00:30:22.367
Why do you insist on coming here?

400
00:30:22.367 --> 00:30:24.367
Haven't you been sending messages?

401
00:30:24.367 --> 00:30:26.800
Is Zhien seriously ill?

402
00:30:26.800 --> 00:30:28.033
Super serious

403
00:30:28.033 --> 00:30:30.467
I felt dizzy after taking the medicine.

404
00:30:30.467 --> 00:30:31.867
Sister Zhihui

405
00:30:31.867 --> 00:30:34.767
This is the first time she does this and I'm really worried

406
00:30:34.767 --> 00:30:36.767
Can I go in and see her?

407
00:30:36.767 --> 00:30:37.700
No, absolutely not.

408
00:30:37.700 --> 00:30:40.367
Really not. You can't kill me.

409
00:30:44.967 --> 00:30:48.333
I hate it when someone comes into my house.

410
00:30:50.433 --> 00:30:52.333
The weather is so hot, come in and kiss me

411
00:30:52.333 --> 00:30:54.267
Come in and kiss me

412
00:30:55.967 --> 00:30:57.800
I am a person who depends on my mood.

413
00:30:58.967 --> 00:31:01.500
Anyway, today is really not possible

414
00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:12.033
Drive carefully

415
00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:18.267
- Just a moment
- Really not.

416
00:31:18.267 --> 00:31:20.300
Watch your feet

417
00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.567
Fasten your seat belts

418
00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:32.067
What should I do?

419
00:31:34.433 --> 00:31:35.967
what to do

420
00:31:39.467 --> 00:31:40.900
Excuse me

421
00:31:40.900 --> 00:31:42.067
this

422
00:31:43.133 --> 00:31:45.733
I think you need it, so I bought it back.

423
00:31:49.467 --> 00:31:50.833
have a good rest

424
00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.600
(My Yun Jae: I don’t think he has a cold.
If it's serious, do you want to go to the hospital with me?)

(Meteor Shower Video

428
00:32:24.533 --> 00:32:27.233
I wanted to go see it with you today.

429
00:32:27.233 --> 00:32:29.167
It's also good to watch it through the video

430
00:32:30.033 --> 00:32:32.333
I'm so worried about you and miss you so much

431
00:32:33.467 --> 00:32:34.767
I love you

433
00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:55.567
Hello

434
00:33:55.567 --> 00:33:58.867
This is no longer admiration, but remembrance.

435
00:33:58.867 --> 00:34:01.267
Using illness as an excuse only works for a day or two

436
00:34:03.167 --> 00:34:04.933
You think of a solution.

437
00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:07.900
Either break up

438
00:34:08.667 --> 00:34:10.167
Either confess

guest

442
00:35:43.567 --> 00:35:45.233
Where did you pick it up?

443
00:35:46.867 --> 00:35:48.833
I asked you where you found it.

444
00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:55.400
Allow

445
00:35:55.400 --> 00:35:58.767
Do you...know me?

446
00:36:01.333 --> 00:36:04.367
Excuse me, who are you?

447
00:36:06.667 --> 00:36:10.133
It's me. I'm Zhien.

448
00:36:10.133 --> 00:36:11.400
What

449
00:36:15.233 --> 00:36:19.100
I don't quite understand what you mean...

450
00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:20.100
I…

451
00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.867
I am your girlfriend

452
00:36:27.367 --> 00:36:29.033

(Jin Zhien's passport and Jin Zhien's bankbook)

454
00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.167
Nothing has changed except becoming a man

455
00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.767
Besides becoming a man?

456
00:37:13.767 --> 00:37:15.133
Is this reasonable?

457
00:37:15.133 --> 00:37:18.333
In other words, only the appearance has changed temporarily.

458
00:37:18.333 --> 00:37:20.333
My heart is 100% Kim Ji-eun

459
00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:25.267
This isn't a prank show, is it?

460
00:37:25.267 --> 00:37:26.600
Did Zhien apply to participate?

461
00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.200
It's not like that

462
00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:31.767
I should have told you before it happened.

463
00:37:31.767 --> 00:37:34.133
I didn't tell you because I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

464
00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.167
Isn't this nonsense?

465
00:37:36.167 --> 00:37:38.367
Who would believe this?

466
00:37:38.967 --> 00:37:42.800
It's normal for you to be confused now.
It's okay after you've experienced it.

467
00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:44.733
Think positively

468
00:37:45.200 --> 00:37:46.533
Think positively?

469
00:37:46.533 --> 00:37:48.300
Didn't you tell me
I don't want to have a weird sister.

470
00:37:48.300 --> 00:37:50.800
Do you want a normal brother?

471
00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:52.533
Just treat me as your brother for now.

472
00:37:52.533 --> 00:37:55.467
When did I ever say I wanted a normal brother?

473
00:37:56.533 --> 00:37:57.667
I did say

474
00:37:57.667 --> 00:38:00.800
Look, if I weren't your girlfriend
How do you know this?

475
00:38:01.133 --> 00:38:02.767
If you have any doubts, just ask

476
00:38:02.767 --> 00:38:04.233
I can answer anything

477
00:38:05.067 --> 00:38:06.833
Our date is June 7th

478
00:38:06.833 --> 00:38:08.967
The first flowers you bought me were tulips

479
00:38:08.967 --> 00:38:11.000
The coffee shop where we first met was Dal Segno

480
00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.333
The place you most want to go is the Atacama Desert

481
00:38:13.333 --> 00:38:15.033
My favorite is...

482
00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.333
Mole on your collarbone

483
00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:25.867
If you want to ask me, I can answer all the questions.

484
00:38:30.233 --> 00:38:31.967
See it still doesn't work

485
00:38:31.967 --> 00:38:34.033
You should say something decent.

486
00:38:35.967 --> 00:38:38.633
No matter how I look at you, I think you are a pervert.

487
00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:41.900
Hey, where is Zhien?

488
00:38:42.667 --> 00:38:44.133
I ask you where is your grace?

489
00:38:44.133 --> 00:38:46.067
Yun Jae, calm down and listen to me.

490
00:38:46.067 --> 00:38:47.933
-Don't let go
-Yunzai

491
00:38:47.933 --> 00:38:49.567
I told you to let go, you little brat.

492
00:38:53.833 --> 00:38:54.933
Hello

493
00:38:54.933 --> 00:38:56.267
Enough

494
00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:58.633
Where did you get the Zhien stuff?

495
00:38:59.467 --> 00:39:01.467
Are you a stalker?

496
00:39:01.467 --> 00:39:03.433
Get up and follow me to the police station

497
00:39:03.433 --> 00:39:06.233
Take what you just said
Tell the police exactly what happened

498
00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.400
knew

499
00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:13.267
I'll go to the police station myself.

500
00:39:13.267 --> 00:39:15.233
Before that, please follow me to a place

501
00:39:21.567 --> 00:39:29.233
So does the tattoo on Ji Eun's shoulder have that meaning?

502
00:39:29.967 --> 00:39:31.400
Proof of identity

503
00:39:32.533 --> 00:39:34.700
This is our grandmother's inheritance.

504
00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:37.167
Similar to high blood pressure and diabetes

505
00:39:39.967 --> 00:39:41.367
Is it hereditary?

506
00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:47.567
Um

507
00:39:47.567 --> 00:39:50.400
It’s a long story, but to put it simply

508
00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.700
My mom is the same

509
00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:54.733
Grandma's family passed down from generation to generation

510
00:39:54.733 --> 00:39:56.567
Some will happen and some won't.

511
00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.800
Whether it will happen or not depends on luck. He did happen.

512
00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.300
Do you want me to believe this?

513
00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:09.033
Yeah, I think it's hard to believe.

514
00:40:09.033 --> 00:40:12.567
Actually, I am too

515
00:40:12.567 --> 00:40:14.567
Important

516
00:40:14.567 --> 00:40:16.900
The ending is certain

517
00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:20.200
I will eventually turn back into someone like my mom.

518
00:40:38.433 --> 00:40:41.067
I need some time

519
00:40:41.067 --> 00:40:42.967
How long can be

520
00:40:42.967 --> 00:40:45.567
I can wait as long as you want.

521
00:40:51.067 --> 00:40:52.533
but

522
00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.300
We're not going to end like this, are we?

523
00:41:16.867 --> 00:41:18.033
Allow

524
00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:23.367
Park Yoon-jae

525
00:41:25.500 --> 00:41:27.933
Can't you just trust me for once?

526
00:42:22.967 --> 00:42:25.833
"The window crack in my memory where the breeze blows"

527
00:42:25.833 --> 00:42:28.800
"Lights blooming one by one"

528
00:42:30.300 --> 00:42:31.333
Is it Zhien?

529
00:42:34.233 --> 00:42:35.000
Hello

530
00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.900
"Pick up the broken pieces again"

531
00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.800
"Put together into a complete shape"

532
00:42:41.333 --> 00:42:45.300
"Will it be me at that moment?"

533
00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:52.067
"Wake up and make up"

534
00:42:52.067 --> 00:42:54.200
"I left it alone after it had already started"

535
00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.533
"I again"

536
00:42:57.500 --> 00:43:01.400
"What if I mix heart
mix heart so my heart"

537
00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:04.500
"I haven't woken up from my dream yet"

538
00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:10.033
"Why am I hanging around you again?"

539
00:43:10.867 --> 00:43:11.767
Excuse me…

540
00:43:12.700 --> 00:43:15.367
Are you Park Yoon Jae?

541
00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.533
Yes I am

542
00:43:17.533 --> 00:43:18.800
Who are you?

543
00:43:20.833 --> 00:43:23.567
I am Song Zhien who has an appointment to come to the social gathering today.

544
00:43:29.133 --> 00:43:31.033
Excuse me…

545
00:43:31.033 --> 00:43:35.367
Aren't you Han Yunzai, who studies finance at Yanxi University?

546
00:43:35.367 --> 00:43:38.267
No, I am Park Yun-jae from the Department of Astronomy

547
00:43:39.033 --> 00:43:41.233
Aren't you Song Zhien from the Foreign Languages Department?

548
00:43:41.233 --> 00:43:43.267
I am Kim Ji-eun from the Korean Department.

549
00:43:44.900 --> 00:43:47.500
Excuse me…

550
00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.300
I'm really sorry...

551
00:44:24.867 --> 00:44:25.867
Looking back

552
00:44:26.733 --> 00:44:29.733
From the first time I saw Zhien
Every moment with her

553
00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:31.967
It's a miracle for me

554
00:44:33.667 --> 00:44:36.100
This is different from what you see with your naked eyes.

555
00:44:36.967 --> 00:44:38.600
If you look closely

556
00:44:38.600 --> 00:44:41.467
Looks and feels very different

557
00:45:02.133 --> 00:45:03.067
Really

558
00:45:05.633 --> 00:45:06.967
Look closely like this

559
00:45:08.067 --> 00:45:09.233
It's really different.

560
00:45:11.867 --> 00:45:12.867
Feeling like...

561
00:45:14.467 --> 00:45:15.567
Looks like

562
00:45:33.467 --> 00:45:34.433
I'm really crazy

563
00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:37.900
I…

564
00:45:37.900 --> 00:45:39.867
I don't know why I say this.

565
00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:42.500
But except for my dad

566
00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:44.733
This is my first time kissing a boy

567
00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.133
What I mean is

568
00:45:49.133 --> 00:45:50.400
I wasn't so reckless...

569
00:45:59.933 --> 00:46:00.667
I also…

570
00:46:01.533 --> 00:46:04.167
I don't know why I say this.

571
00:46:04.167 --> 00:46:05.233
It's my first time too

572
00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:08.167
Besides the stars

573
00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:11.867
This is the first time I see other beings

574
00:46:11.867 --> 00:46:13.600
My heart is beating so fast

575
00:47:08.767 --> 00:47:10.200
This is ridiculous.

576
00:47:11.800 --> 00:47:14.800
Is this also one of the miracles I experienced with Zhien?

577
00:47:32.767 --> 00:47:33.700
Hello

578
00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:35.000
Did you get home safely?

579
00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:37.533
Please ask which

580
00:47:37.533 --> 00:47:39.000
My Great Grace

581
00:47:40.833 --> 00:47:42.800
Are you kidding me?

582
00:47:56.767 --> 00:47:58.200
No matter what

583
00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:00.000
Should I teach my girlfriend how to shave?

584
00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:02.567
This isn't quite right.

585
00:48:03.767 --> 00:48:05.533
If she's not careful, she might get a scar on her face.

586
00:48:08.233 --> 00:48:09.667
No matter…

587
00:48:09.667 --> 00:48:11.233
Just give her the things, she should be able to figure it out on her own.

588
00:48:35.267 --> 00:48:37.300
There shouldn't be a need to do that.

589
00:48:40.567 --> 00:48:42.900
I feel a little bit excited.

590
00:48:46.667 --> 00:48:47.900
Do you have any ointment?

591
00:48:47.900 --> 00:48:48.833
What

592
00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:53.267
This one?

593
00:48:53.267 --> 00:48:55.000
It just looks serious and doesn't hurt at all

594
00:48:55.733 --> 00:48:57.667
But you still need to apply medicine.

595
00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:00.333
Isn't it?

596
00:49:01.033 --> 00:49:02.967
What if there is a scar?

597
00:49:02.967 --> 00:49:04.833
Even if it leaves scars

598
00:49:04.833 --> 00:49:07.733
This is the medal you gave me for punching me in the face.

599
00:49:07.733 --> 00:49:09.000
Hello

600
00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:10.833
How can you say that?

601
00:49:12.133 --> 00:49:12.967
Isn't it?

602
00:49:12.967 --> 00:49:15.000
Why are you so mean to me?

603
00:49:17.133 --> 00:49:19.400
Hey so what should I do

604
00:49:29.300 --> 00:49:30.900
Apply on hands

605
00:49:30.900 --> 00:49:33.000
Then apply evenly on face

606
00:49:36.167 --> 00:49:38.167
A little further up, from top to bottom

607
00:49:40.067 --> 00:49:41.167
Very good

608
00:49:41.167 --> 00:49:42.500
This is so fun

609
00:49:43.767 --> 00:49:45.033
Don't you think I look like Santa Claus?

610
00:49:46.300 --> 00:49:47.667
Look in the mirror

611
00:49:50.633 --> 00:49:51.900
There's a razor next to it.

612
00:49:52.767 --> 00:49:53.767
have

613
00:49:56.633 --> 00:49:57.467
Dry

614
00:49:59.333 --> 00:50:00.200
for you

615
00:50:02.767 --> 00:50:03.967
Put the part with shaving foam

616
00:50:03.967 --> 00:50:06.067
Gently scrape from top to bottom

617
00:50:06.067 --> 00:50:07.300
From top to bottom?

618
00:50:07.300 --> 00:50:08.167
Lighten up

619
00:50:10.233 --> 00:50:11.733
A little lighter

620
00:50:11.733 --> 00:50:13.000
Scrape down

621
00:50:13.800 --> 00:50:14.667
Scrape gently

622
00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:19.067
I told you to be gentler.

623
00:50:19.067 --> 00:50:20.167
Let me see

624
00:50:21.333 --> 00:50:22.467
Bleeding

625
00:50:26.067 --> 00:50:29.267
The most important thing when shaving is the angle

626
00:50:29.933 --> 00:50:31.233
I'll show you once.

627
00:50:32.100 --> 00:50:34.100
Don't talk, don't move.

628
00:50:35.100 --> 00:50:36.300
Good to know

629
00:50:36.300 --> 00:50:37.733
I told you not to talk.

630
00:50:44.200 --> 00:50:45.600
From the diagonal

631
00:50:45.600 --> 00:50:47.767
Scrape slowly from top to bottom

632
00:50:49.567 --> 00:50:50.833
Angles are important

633
00:50:51.367 --> 00:50:52.767
From top to bottom

634
00:50:53.733 --> 00:50:54.933
The same is true next to it

635
00:51:24.100 --> 00:51:25.033
You put your head

636
00:51:25.733 --> 00:51:27.100
Can you turn over there?

637
00:51:29.967 --> 00:51:30.800
Is that so?

638
00:51:31.667 --> 00:51:32.433
right

639
00:52:05.133 --> 00:52:06.067
I'll do it

640
00:52:10.867 --> 00:52:12.233
Good for you

641
00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.267
Is this the case?

642
00:52:20.267 --> 00:52:22.500
No, the angle is a bit wrong.

643
00:52:23.833 --> 00:52:25.067
Is this the case?

644
00:52:25.633 --> 00:52:26.733
good

645
00:52:28.367 --> 00:52:29.967
This kid looks like this...

646
00:52:31.567 --> 00:52:33.767
How come you are so handsome?

647
00:52:58.400 --> 00:52:59.900
that

648
00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.667
I've done what I need to do, so I'll leave now.

649
00:53:05.033 --> 00:53:06.833
Are you leaving so soon?

650
00:53:06.833 --> 00:53:09.100
You've only been here for thirty minutes.

651
00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.667
Dinner time is almost here. I have to go.

652
00:53:12.667 --> 00:53:13.567
Still have to go to work

653
00:53:13.567 --> 00:53:15.733
Don't you start working at 5 o'clock at night?

654
00:53:15.733 --> 00:53:17.267
It's only 3 o'clock now

655
00:53:19.133 --> 00:53:21.100
Your sister will be off work soon.

656
00:53:21.100 --> 00:53:23.767
My sister went to Busan on a business trip.

657
00:53:26.133 --> 00:53:27.667
Right

658
00:53:27.667 --> 00:53:30.900
People who usually don't move like furniture
I happened to be on a business trip at this time.

659
00:53:33.400 --> 00:53:35.633
Can't you just have a bowl of instant noodles before leaving?

660
00:53:42.433 --> 00:53:44.233
Eat before leaving

661
00:53:47.467 --> 00:53:49.200
Eat before leaving

662
00:53:51.167 --> 00:53:53.367
Don't you want to stay with me?

663
00:53:54.867 --> 00:53:55.967
Please

664
00:53:56.733 --> 00:53:58.267
Please

665
00:53:58.933 --> 00:54:00.600
-no…
- Please

666
00:54:00.600 --> 00:54:02.467
-I…
- Please

667
00:54:09.233 --> 00:54:12.500
I have to go today.

668
00:55:07.100 --> 00:55:08.500
Oh my god

669
00:55:08.500 --> 00:55:11.467
Your dark circles have become more severe

670
00:55:11.467 --> 00:55:12.733
What happened

671
00:55:13.633 --> 00:55:15.233
Hello Lee Min Hyuk

672
00:55:15.233 --> 00:55:17.367
If your girlfriend

673
00:55:17.367 --> 00:55:19.933
What would you do if you suddenly became a boy?

674
00:55:19.933 --> 00:55:21.833
Why didn't you even give a notice?

675
00:55:21.833 --> 00:55:23.067
Such a terrible assumption

676
00:55:23.067 --> 00:55:25.100
Even more handsome than you

677
00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:26.967
He is tall and strong.

678
00:55:28.167 --> 00:55:29.867
This is a two-choice game

679
00:55:29.867 --> 00:55:33.267
Is he like his girlfriend's boyfriend or like his boyfriend's girlfriend?

680
00:55:33.267 --> 00:55:34.733
Yes, it's a two-choice game

681
00:55:34.733 --> 00:55:35.833
Which one would you choose?

682
00:55:36.567 --> 00:55:38.700
Of course the second one

683
00:55:38.700 --> 00:55:40.500
Is this even a question?

684
00:55:48.567 --> 00:55:50.600
Then I'll go first

685
00:55:50.600 --> 00:55:51.900
good

686
00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.833
That's right, brother

687
00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.800
I thought about it carefully.

688
00:55:58.800 --> 00:56:01.133
If my girlfriend suddenly becomes a boy one day

689
00:56:01.133 --> 00:56:03.600
I will definitely ask him this question

690
00:56:03.600 --> 00:56:04.933
What is the problem?

691
00:56:04.933 --> 00:56:07.400
Is there any opportunity?

692
00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:08.767
An opportunity?

693
00:56:08.767 --> 00:56:10.100
Isn't that how fairy tales are written?

694
00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.333
Breaking promises, being jealous of others, or being overly curious

695
00:56:13.333 --> 00:56:15.867
There must be some kind of opportunity for this kind of magic.

696
00:56:15.867 --> 00:56:17.067
As long as you know what the opportunity is

697
00:56:17.067 --> 00:56:19.400
It's just a matter of time before the magic is lifted.

698
00:56:21.967 --> 00:56:24.067
An opportunity to become a boy?

699
00:56:24.900 --> 00:56:27.900
I don't know. It seems nothing special.

700
00:56:30.167 --> 00:56:31.800
That's right

701
00:56:31.800 --> 00:56:32.833
Double yolk

702
00:56:32.833 --> 00:56:34.133
Double yolk?

703
00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:37.433
Oh my god

704
00:56:37.433 --> 00:56:41.333
This is the first time I have seen double yolks in my life.

705
00:56:44.767 --> 00:56:46.533
Double yolk?

706
00:56:46.533 --> 00:56:49.967
If all else fails, there is only one way left.

707
00:56:49.967 --> 00:56:52.200
Just do it first and then talk about it

708
00:56:52.200 --> 00:56:53.833
What to do directly

709
00:56:55.600 --> 00:56:58.600
Kiss

710
00:57:00.600 --> 00:57:02.200
Regardless of ancient and modern times, China and foreign

711
00:57:02.200 --> 00:57:05.267
Isn't the cheat for forbidden love just kissing?

712
00:57:06.333 --> 00:57:08.300
That sounds like the answer you would say.

713
00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:11.533
- Kiss your ass
- Really

714
00:57:11.533 --> 00:57:13.000
If you encounter such an inexplicable situation

715
00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:14.600
Isn't it better to break up?

716
00:57:14.600 --> 00:57:16.900
Aren't you worried about this because you can't break up?

717
00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:18.867
Well, at least give it a try.

718
00:57:25.867 --> 00:57:27.400
Soft candy?

719
00:57:28.567 --> 00:57:31.533
I was very cautious when I was a kid.

720
00:57:31.533 --> 00:57:34.167
My mom gave me candy.

721
00:57:34.167 --> 00:57:38.500
When I feel uneasy, I eat some candy and it makes me feel better.

722
00:57:39.100 --> 00:57:41.567
I don't know if I feel comforted.

723
00:57:41.567 --> 00:57:43.733
It really makes you feel much better.

724
00:57:44.667 --> 00:57:46.033
You have me now

725
00:57:46.033 --> 00:57:48.100
I don't think I need fudge anymore.

726
00:57:50.167 --> 00:57:52.233
gentlemen

727
00:57:52.233 --> 00:57:53.933
Did you know…

728
00:57:53.933 --> 00:57:56.667
Like someone

729
00:57:56.667 --> 00:57:59.400
Does it also require courage?

730
00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:02.367
I ate so many gummies when I was dating you

731
00:58:06.133 --> 00:58:09.367
If you don't want to wear dentures in the future
If I want to tie you down with a ring

732
00:58:09.367 --> 00:58:11.533
Then I have to treat you better.

733
00:58:15.300 --> 00:58:17.367
That's enough for now.

734
00:58:17.367 --> 00:58:20.367
Just stay by my side like you are now

735
00:58:20.367 --> 00:58:22.133
That's enough for me.

736
00:58:40.333 --> 00:58:41.500
Who is it?

737
00:58:42.267 --> 00:58:43.400
It's me

738
00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.567
Allow

739
00:58:45.567 --> 00:58:46.933
Is it allowed?

740
00:58:56.833 --> 00:58:57.867
What's going on?

741
00:58:57.867 --> 00:58:59.867
What's the matter with you coming to see me so late?

742
00:59:01.633 --> 00:59:04.267
I have something I must do now.

743
00:59:05.833 --> 00:59:09.433
What happened?

744
00:59:13.267 --> 00:59:15.500
Let's try it

745
00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.000
Hack Bar

746
00:59:49.033 --> 00:59:51.600
(postscript)

747
00:59:58.833 --> 01:00:01.733
I need some time

748
01:00:01.733 --> 01:00:03.533
It takes as long as you want.

749
01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:05.800
It doesn't matter how long it takes you.

750
01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:09.667
But we should...

751
01:00:10.533 --> 01:00:12.867
It won't end like this.

752
01:00:25.300 --> 01:00:26.533
Allow

753
01:00:30.167 --> 01:00:31.700
Park Yoon-jae

754
01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:36.433
Can't you trust me for once?

755
01:00:38.300 --> 01:00:40.200
Unbelievable

756
01:00:40.200 --> 01:00:43.600
No, I don't want to believe it.

757
01:00:44.133 --> 01:00:46.000
It's true

758
01:00:47.767 --> 01:00:50.633
I can't live without you

759
01:00:50.633 --> 01:00:53.133
But at this moment I understood

760
01:00:55.100 --> 01:00:57.533
The boy in front of me

761
01:00:57.533 --> 01:01:01.900
It's really my girlfriend Kim Ji-eun

762
01:01:47.133 --> 01:01:51.267
(My girlfriend is more handsome than me)

763
01:01:51.267 --> 01:01:54.367
I'm afraid Yun Jae will break up with me

764
01:01:54.367 --> 01:01:58.333
Honestly, it's hard to maintain the previous relationship.

765
01:01:58.333 --> 01:02:00.433
Big eyes and white skin

766
01:02:00.433 --> 01:02:01.900
Introduce me to

767
01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:02.700
Yuli

768
01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.267
What happened to that perfect man?

769
01:02:05.267 --> 01:02:07.700
I am Ji Eun, okay? Kim Ji Eun

770
01:02:07.700 --> 01:02:08.500
Watch it

771
01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.167
Let me teach you a trick

772
01:02:11.167 --> 01:02:13.767
Hello, my name is Lee Min Hyuk

773
01:02:13.767 --> 01:02:15.833
What, where is he?

774
01:02:15.833 --> 01:02:18.100
Where is your kindness, kid?
