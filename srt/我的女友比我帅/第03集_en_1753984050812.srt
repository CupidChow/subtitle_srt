00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:39,100
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

6
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:59,033
That's ridiculous.

7
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,100
It is really a great grace

8
00:01:21,933 --> 00:01:22,967
Great Grace

9
00:01:24,267 --> 00:01:25,767
Great Grace

10
00:01:34,833 --> 00:01:36,200
Burning badly

11
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,233
What's going on?

12
00:02:02,133 --> 00:02:03,767
Minhyuk, I'll explain it to you later.

13
00:02:03,767 --> 00:02:04,767
Feel sorry

14
00:02:09,033 --> 00:02:11,167
Family of Ms. Kim Ji-eun

15
00:02:11,167 --> 00:02:12,000
It's me here

16
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,533
Ms. Jin Zhien's blood and CT scans are all normal.

17
00:02:16,533 --> 00:02:19,367
Nothing special

18
00:02:19,367 --> 00:02:21,133
I've been on IV drip and the fever has subsided.

19
00:02:21,133 --> 00:02:23,533
The patient can be discharged from the hospital once he wakes up.

20
00:02:24,267 --> 00:02:27,067
Wait, doctor, is there really nothing wrong with her body?

21
00:02:27,067 --> 00:02:28,633
No abnormality

22
00:02:30,867 --> 00:02:32,333
Great Grace

23
00:02:32,767 --> 00:02:34,133
Are you awake?

24
00:02:34,133 --> 00:02:35,533
Yunzai

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,900
Why am I in the hospital?

26
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:51,933
Zhien is fine.

27
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,000
You're a girl again.

28
00:03:07,533 --> 00:03:08,700
It's alright...

29
00:03:08,700 --> 00:03:10,033
Arrange for her to see a psychiatric outpatient clinic

30
00:03:10,033 --> 00:03:10,833
good

31
00:03:10,833 --> 00:03:12,067
Am I really a girl?

32
00:03:12,067 --> 00:03:13,600
Really

33
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:16,267
Thank you, doctor.

34
00:03:16,267 --> 00:03:18,500
Thank you, you're alright, congratulations.

35
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,367

How to be happy

38
00:03:28,567 --> 00:03:31,467
I haven't told my sister yet, she'll probably be shocked.

39
00:03:31,467 --> 00:03:33,833
Even I can't believe it

40
00:03:33,833 --> 00:03:35,667
You too, Yunjae

41
00:03:38,033 --> 00:03:41,367
But why don't you speak?

42
00:03:41,933 --> 00:03:44,233
What's going on? Wait

43
00:03:44,233 --> 00:03:46,067
The picture seems to be frozen

44
00:03:46,067 --> 00:03:47,433
I'll call you later

45
00:03:47,433 --> 00:03:49,733
No, no pause

46
00:03:51,133 --> 00:03:53,867
What? Why are you doing that? It's weird.

47
00:03:53,867 --> 00:03:56,100
Because I feel happy just looking at you

48
00:03:57,233 --> 00:04:00,100
We've been together forever and just separated

49
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:01,367
fine

50
00:04:01,367 --> 00:04:03,767
I understand you. I understand your feelings very well.

51
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:08,867
Can I come in for a moment?

52
00:04:08,867 --> 00:04:11,233
Wait a minute, I'll call you back later

53
00:04:11,233 --> 00:04:12,467
good

54
00:04:14,833 --> 00:04:16,533
Well, come in.

55
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,700
Do you finally understand the importance of knocking?

56
00:04:22,700 --> 00:04:24,000
Why is it so abnormal?

57
00:04:25,233 --> 00:04:28,100
Who are you talking to on the phone? Why are you smiling so happily?

58
00:04:28,100 --> 00:04:30,367
Why are you curious about this?

59
00:04:30,367 --> 00:04:34,867
Of course it's because you are my only brother

60
00:04:37,433 --> 00:04:39,167
elder brother

61
00:04:40,567 --> 00:04:44,667
No matter what kind of relationship you have, I can understand it.

62
00:04:44,667 --> 00:04:47,033
What is the love in this world that has no right or wrong?

63
00:04:48,167 --> 00:04:49,700
Just different from others

64
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:52,000
Did you take the wrong medicine?

65
00:04:54,733 --> 00:04:57,367
Sorry I was so ignorant before.

66
00:04:57,367 --> 00:04:58,600
Hey, let me go.

67
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,833
open

68
00:04:59,833 --> 00:05:01,333
Come on, bro

69
00:05:01,333 --> 00:05:02,567
come on

70
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,633
Hello

71
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:04,867
Hey, let me go.

72
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:07,133
Hey, let me go

74
00:05:12,367 --> 00:05:13,800

Min-gyu Do-hee

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,867
I thought you couldn't get married.

77
00:05:17,867 --> 00:05:19,333
How is that possible?

78
00:05:19,333 --> 00:05:20,333
The wedding is held here

79
00:05:20,333 --> 00:05:22,900
The parking lot is very good. Of course, parking is important.

80
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,167
Having said that

81
00:05:27,167 --> 00:05:29,600
Zhihui, don't you have a boyfriend?

82
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,333
I mean, you haven't been in a relationship for a long time.

83
00:05:32,333 --> 00:05:33,033
I'm not young anymore

84
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:36,667
I'm sorry you don't have a boyfriend and I still let you catch the bouquet

85
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:42,667
I have a boyfriend.

86
00:05:42,667 --> 00:05:43,600
Really

87
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,367
Yes, of course

88
00:05:45,367 --> 00:05:48,833
I don't believe it, let me see the photo.

89
00:05:48,833 --> 00:05:51,500
Are you being cheated all day long?

90
00:05:57,267 --> 00:05:58,800
Photos?

91
00:06:00,667 --> 00:06:01,833
OK

92
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,800
Found it

93
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,067
Here

94
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:11,367
What

95
00:06:30,033 --> 00:06:31,633
Wow, he's an idol, right? How old is he?

96
00:06:31,633 --> 00:06:32,800
When did you start dating?

97
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:37,133
We've known each other for a long time.

98
00:06:37,133 --> 00:06:38,700
Too strong

99
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,633
It turns out that Jin Zhihui is a master of love

100
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,367
No

101
00:06:41,367 --> 00:06:44,133
But why isn't there a single photo?

102
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:45,233
You are so sharp

103
00:06:46,567 --> 00:06:49,333
I don't like taking pictures.

104
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:52,700
It's very suspicious. Call him and see.

105
00:06:53,467 --> 00:06:54,767
Yes, call him.

106
00:06:54,767 --> 00:06:56,967
If you want to make a call, just make a video call

107
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:58,467
Good video

108
00:07:00,633 --> 00:07:02,300
Video

109
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,933
Just once

110
00:07:04,567 --> 00:07:06,067
I'll ask

111
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,300
good

112
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:08,933
You guys eat first

113
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,933
Where are you going on your honeymoon?

114
00:07:11,933 --> 00:07:15,533
(My sister)
Africa Africa?

115
00:07:15,533 --> 00:07:16,767
(Honey)
It suits you very well

116
00:07:16,767 --> 00:07:18,733
Why go to Africa

117
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:21,867
You don't understand. Many people are going to Africa recently.

118
00:07:21,867 --> 00:07:25,033
(Honey)
Do you want a video call? Really?

119
00:07:25,033 --> 00:07:26,767
We haven't been there

120
00:07:26,767 --> 00:07:28,200
(Honey)
He called

121
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,533
Look

122
00:07:33,433 --> 00:07:36,433
Honey, I'm meeting my college classmates today.

123
00:07:36,433 --> 00:07:37,867
Say hello to them

124
00:07:37,867 --> 00:07:39,667
Hello Qiangqiang

125
00:07:39,667 --> 00:07:42,433
I finally recovered and I became a girl again

126
00:07:43,633 --> 00:07:44,867
etc…

127
00:07:44,867 --> 00:07:47,833
It doesn't feel real yet, but it's awesome.

128
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:49,500
I just went to the ladies' room to pee.

129
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,667
I was so moved that I almost cried.

130
00:07:51,667 --> 00:07:55,400
You must have felt uncomfortable living with me before.

131
00:07:55,400 --> 00:07:57,300
I will really treat you well in the future

132
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,400
I love you

133
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,900
Bye

134
00:08:03,967 --> 00:08:05,167
this…

135
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,000
This seems to be the latest phone scam.

136
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,700
Right, sisters?

137
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,333
Sorry I got scared.

138
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,700
My lovely sister Zhien is back

139
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:36,100
Get lost

140
00:09:15,733 --> 00:09:17,467
(My Yunzai)

141
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:24,733
Didn't we just talk all night yesterday?

142
00:09:35,533 --> 00:09:40,133
(My Greatest Grace)
I'm video chatting in the shower and it's really annoying.

143
00:10:04,567 --> 00:10:05,600
Thank God

144
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,600
Thank God

145
00:10:21,767 --> 00:10:22,967
Thank God

146
00:10:22,967 --> 00:10:24,467
Thank God

147
00:10:30,500 --> 00:10:31,233
good

148
00:10:32,067 --> 00:10:33,467
bring it on

149
00:10:33,467 --> 00:10:34,667
Come despite

150
00:10:50,233 --> 00:10:52,200
Why do you have to endure for three seconds?

151
00:10:57,433 --> 00:11:00,533
If you've touched me enough, please get out of the way.

152
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,100
God really does exist

153
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:07,833
From today on, I will believe all the nonsense in the world

154
00:11:07,833 --> 00:11:10,500
God, Buddha, alien conspiracy theories, none left out

155
00:11:11,067 --> 00:11:12,100
OK

156
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,833
It's better than believing nothing.

157
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,833
Do you remember when you were a man?

158
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,767
How can I remember you looking at me up and down like a pervert every day?

159
00:11:19,767 --> 00:11:20,767
I don't have

160
00:11:20,767 --> 00:11:24,567
I just didn't do it, I don't know how many times he took off my clothes with his eyes.

161
00:11:26,233 --> 00:11:27,433
Really

162
00:11:28,167 --> 00:11:31,500
You really are not like me.

163
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:33,633
Nonsense

164
00:11:34,067 --> 00:11:35,933
This is so exaggerated that I can't stand it

165
00:11:35,933 --> 00:11:37,833
(Let's work together to maintain clean streets in Noryangjin)

166
00:11:39,300 --> 00:11:40,767
It's Yingshuo, thank you.

167
00:11:41,167 --> 00:11:43,333
Are you full? I'm about to eat.

168
00:11:43,333 --> 00:11:44,633
Thank you for your concern

169
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:47,900
Hello

170
00:11:48,967 --> 00:11:50,333
Long time no see

171
00:11:50,333 --> 00:11:51,700
Goodbye

172
00:11:52,667 --> 00:11:53,900
Hello, Madam Boss

173
00:11:53,900 --> 00:11:55,767
Hello, Yingshuo, hello everyone.

174
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,133
Yingshuo, this is for you.

175
00:11:58,133 --> 00:11:59,700
Thank you, you're so kind.

176
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,467
Thank you. I'll be leaving first.

177
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,100
(Exam Udon)

178
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,233
No need... I'll do it.

179
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,833
Just say no

180
00:12:13,267 --> 00:12:14,867
Just put the heavy things away

181
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:16,467
I'll help when I pass by.

182
00:12:16,467 --> 00:12:18,767
You need to get out of here quickly, kid.

183
00:12:18,767 --> 00:12:20,700
How long will it take

184
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:21,867
Do you like me so much?

185
00:12:23,167 --> 00:12:24,433
Just wait and see

186
00:12:24,433 --> 00:12:26,900
I can see my chance in Noryangjin

187
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:28,433
Only until this year

188
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:30,500
You said the same thing last year.

189
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:34,200
The year before last, the year before last, the year before last, the year before last, also said

190
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:36,867
How can you be so consistent?

191
00:12:36,867 --> 00:12:38,133
Sit down quickly

192
00:12:38,133 --> 00:12:39,533
I'll fry your pork chops.

193
00:12:50,833 --> 00:12:52,233
Hello, Miss Sadako

194
00:12:52,233 --> 00:12:53,967
No, I was about to eat...

195
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,033
Are you in Noryangjin?

196
00:12:57,033 --> 00:12:59,067
(Fool's Salt Roast Pork)

197
00:12:59,067 --> 00:13:00,233
Coming

198
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:07,800
that…

199
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,933
I'll just drink this.

200
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:18,533
You can't drink alcohol?

201
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,433
Because it affects reading

202
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:23,333
So I don't drink it.

203
00:13:23,333 --> 00:13:24,600
I see

204
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,067
This is your tenth year as a civil servant, right?

205
00:13:29,067 --> 00:13:31,567
Seven years and eight months to be exact

206
00:13:31,567 --> 00:13:33,667
I will definitely pass the exam this year

207
00:13:36,333 --> 00:13:40,867
You have goals and confidence

208
00:13:40,867 --> 00:13:42,767
I work very hard.

209
00:13:43,233 --> 00:13:44,567
So enviable

210
00:13:46,833 --> 00:13:49,833
Are you trying to say I'm being unreasonable?

211
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,167
I wouldn't do that.

212
00:13:57,100 --> 00:14:00,000
I envy people who take life seriously.

213
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,900
Because that is also a talent.

214
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,167
I've never been serious in my life.

215
00:14:09,167 --> 00:14:11,000
In addition to drinking

216
00:14:16,867 --> 00:14:18,600
Let's eat meat and drink

217
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,833
Otherwise it will hurt your stomach

218
00:14:21,167 --> 00:14:24,867
Are you kind to others?

219
00:14:26,167 --> 00:14:28,167
After all, we have been on a blind date.

220
00:14:28,167 --> 00:14:29,233
You are not someone else

221
00:14:29,233 --> 00:14:31,033
What is a blind date?

222
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:35,200
This isn't the first blind date, is it?

223
00:14:36,267 --> 00:14:37,867
You seem a bit old.

224
00:14:39,133 --> 00:14:40,700
Sorry, I won't answer this question.

225
00:14:42,667 --> 00:14:45,167
Do not answer in this situation

226
00:14:45,167 --> 00:14:47,100
I'd be a little scared.

227
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,267
Let me do it

228
00:15:02,533 --> 00:15:05,100
From now on, I'll pour your wine.

229
00:15:14,067 --> 00:15:15,533
Whatever you want

230
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:22,000
Do you like anglerfish stew?

231
00:15:28,700 --> 00:15:30,167
OMG

232
00:15:30,833 --> 00:15:32,133
What's going on?

233
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,100
Very smelly

234
00:15:35,867 --> 00:15:38,233
Is it appropriate for two girls to have a refrigerator like this in a house?

235
00:15:38,233 --> 00:15:39,433
Mom, do you know?

236
00:15:39,433 --> 00:15:42,333
It's very rude to open someone else's refrigerator.

237
00:15:42,333 --> 00:15:43,367
That's right

238
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:44,933
"Others"

239
00:15:45,833 --> 00:15:46,900
other people

240
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:49,467
Your 22 hours

241
00:15:49,467 --> 00:15:52,033
You were born after 15 hours of labor.

242
00:15:52,033 --> 00:15:55,267
"Others"? Why do you talk like that?

243
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,400
How am I?

244
00:15:58,367 --> 00:16:00,800
Husband, let's start from here.

245
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,733
I'll take this to the toilet.

246
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:08,833
Really

247
00:16:08,833 --> 00:16:09,967
Can't stand it

248
00:16:16,767 --> 00:16:18,867
dad

249
00:16:21,833 --> 00:16:24,533
The princesses have grown up, why don't they take good care of themselves?

250
00:16:24,533 --> 00:16:26,433
Why didn't you tell me you were coming?

251
00:16:26,433 --> 00:16:27,767
Then we'll sort it out.

252
00:16:27,767 --> 00:16:30,100
That's why I deliberately didn't tell you. Dad wanted to help you sort it out.

253
00:16:30,667 --> 00:16:32,700
I really miss Dad.

254
00:16:33,833 --> 00:16:35,000
Will you stay overnight?

255
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:36,767
Isn't the store closed today?

256
00:16:36,767 --> 00:16:38,900
Dad wants to too.

257
00:16:38,900 --> 00:16:40,767
But there are guests who have reservations in the afternoon

258
00:16:40,767 --> 00:16:41,900
I still have to go back to open the shop

259
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:43,300
Tell mom to go back by herself

260
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:44,633
Of course?

261
00:16:44,633 --> 00:16:46,667
Dad can't do anything.

262
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,900
Stop Action

263
00:17:06,167 --> 00:17:07,233
What's the matter?

264
00:17:07,767 --> 00:17:10,667
We've all grown up.

265
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,167
It's not surprising that there is such a thing.

266
00:17:13,167 --> 00:17:16,100
Yeah, it's not strange.

267
00:17:17,467 --> 00:17:19,933
But shaving at my daughter's house

268
00:17:21,767 --> 00:17:25,667
Who is this daring guy who even left his underwear behind?

269
00:17:26,433 --> 00:17:28,033
Is that the guy in the room photo?

270
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:31,200
No

271
00:17:31,567 --> 00:17:33,800
Our Yunzai is very simple

272
00:17:35,267 --> 00:17:36,467
That's you

273
00:17:37,033 --> 00:17:38,100
Who is

274
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:41,733
Now that it's like this, just say it directly

275
00:17:41,733 --> 00:17:43,267
It's so scary. No way.

276
00:17:43,267 --> 00:17:46,167
Why don't you tell me what happened?

277
00:17:46,167 --> 00:17:47,300
mom

278
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:50,000
Actually, this is what happened

279
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,700
Not long ago she became...

280
00:17:55,267 --> 00:17:57,833
That's my sister's boyfriend's.

281
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:02,100
Really

282
00:18:02,100 --> 00:18:04,167
Is this really your boyfriend's?

283
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:06,367
Boyfriend?

284
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:10,767
Now that it's like this, let's show the photos to my parents.

285
00:18:10,767 --> 00:18:12,233
Don't you have a lot of photos on your phone?

286
00:18:12,233 --> 00:18:15,767
Yeah, let's take a look at the eldest daughter's boyfriend.

287
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,467
My dad has never seen it. I'm so curious.

288
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:27,233
Next time, let me see that kind of thing

289
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:30,767
I'm going to ask him to come and ask me for marriage.

290
00:18:30,767 --> 00:18:32,700
Yeah, remember to eat on time.

291
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,767
If you have anything, be sure to call me.

292
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:37,000
Go back quickly. I prepared some side dishes for Yuri.

293
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,433
Don't forget to give it to her.

294
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,133
Supreme Wisdom

295
00:18:53,633 --> 00:18:55,633
Open the door while I'm in a good mood

296
00:18:55,633 --> 00:18:57,400
I can't let my parents worry about me.

297
00:18:57,400 --> 00:18:59,500
Just say you're my boyfriend. Why are you messing with me?

298
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,167
I can't ruin Yun Jae's image.

299
00:19:01,633 --> 00:19:02,967
So it's okay for me?

300
00:19:02,967 --> 00:19:04,300
Open it now

301
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,767
Who told you to take a secret photo of me? This is karma.

302
00:19:06,767 --> 00:19:09,033
What the hell did you say?

303
00:19:09,033 --> 00:19:10,000
Hello

304
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,567
Once you become a man, you will become much stronger

305
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,233
Please stop pushing it.

306
00:19:16,233 --> 00:19:18,033
OK, look at mine.

307
00:19:18,967 --> 00:19:23,033
That's enough. Damn, she's really strong.

308
00:19:32,233 --> 00:19:35,667
But why didn't you tell your parents?

309
00:19:35,667 --> 00:19:37,967
What about you becoming a man?

310
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:40,767
Anyway, it's all back, so it doesn't matter.

311
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:52,000
I've experienced it myself.

312
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:55,600
But my daughters can't do that, husband.

313
00:20:08,433 --> 00:20:10,867
Anyway, I won't say anything since it's back.

314
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:13,700
Why make them worry about the past?

315
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,367
It won't happen again anyway.

316
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:24,333
What's going on?

317
00:20:26,533 --> 00:20:27,567
clang

318
00:20:30,333 --> 00:20:31,167
Watch it

319
00:20:32,233 --> 00:20:33,767
This is really the last time.

320
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,900
Sea sausage…

321
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:43,800
Sea sausage

322
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,033
Crazy Woman

323
00:20:54,333 --> 00:20:55,533
fit

324
00:21:05,067 --> 00:21:08,133
Could the boss lady be a rich second generation?

325
00:21:08,933 --> 00:21:11,433
Or a divorced woman who received a large amount of alimony

326
00:21:12,433 --> 00:21:13,267
What

327
00:21:13,267 --> 00:21:15,767
No, because it's too unreasonable.

328
00:21:15,767 --> 00:21:18,833
When you have nothing to do in your own store, go to other people's stores to spend money

329
00:21:18,833 --> 00:21:22,667
He doesn't care about business, he wears all branded clothes and drives a sports car.

330
00:21:22,667 --> 00:21:24,600
Hey, we're just working.

331
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:26,033
Just get your salary on time

332
00:21:26,033 --> 00:21:28,233
Why are you curious about that?

333
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,633
Could it be that...

334
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:32,467
Is she the landlord?

335
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:34,900
Or the landlord's daughter

336
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,967
Hey, stop guessing.

337
00:21:37,967 --> 00:21:39,433
Work quickly

338
00:21:39,433 --> 00:21:41,300
There's nothing to do anyway.

339
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:52,867
(My Greatest Grace)
Could it be another double yolk?

340
00:21:52,867 --> 00:21:54,633
It's a bit hairy, isn't it?

341
00:21:55,633 --> 00:21:58,333
The so-called prophecy

342
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,733
Maybe she really is the landlord?

343
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,400
Did it come true?

344
00:22:06,233 --> 00:22:07,967
just in case…

345
00:22:08,967 --> 00:22:11,100
It's because of the double yolk that I became a boy.

346
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:14,133
I cracked an egg while cooking instant noodles

347
00:22:14,133 --> 00:22:15,900
Double yolk again

348
00:22:16,900 --> 00:22:18,467
Then...

349
00:22:20,833 --> 00:22:23,067
Became a man again

350
00:22:25,733 --> 00:22:27,833
Yun Jae, are you okay?

351
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:32,467
Are you coming over now?

352
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:33,867
Aren't you working?

353
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:41,533
I'll be there soon, you must wait for me

354
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:44,500
I will buy a lot of food and can't eat anything else.

355
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:47,233
Takeaway: one portion each of spicy rice cake and blood sausage dumplings

356
00:23:26,133 --> 00:23:28,700
Didn't you say flour is unhealthy?

357
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:31,300
Aren’t dumplings and rice cakes also made of flour?

358
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:37,267
This is rice cake made from rice.

359
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:40,033
Just eat the filling of the dumplings

360
00:23:45,967 --> 00:23:47,800
You look sweaty.

361
00:23:48,833 --> 00:23:50,500
fool

362
00:23:50,500 --> 00:23:54,167
How could I become a boy because of a double yolk?

363
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:57,100
Did you find out?

364
00:23:58,133 --> 00:24:00,300
When I was a boy

365
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,600
Is it that scary?

366
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:06,800
I think it's fun to be friends with you.

367
00:24:06,800 --> 00:24:08,633
It's not scary.

368
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:13,467
No

369
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:14,867
sorry

370
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:20,467
It's not me who should say sorry

371
00:24:21,733 --> 00:24:23,567
Thank you

372
00:24:23,567 --> 00:24:25,133
I love you

373
00:24:59,500 --> 00:25:01,367
"Cause I love you"

374
00:25:01,367 --> 00:25:03,000
"Would you tell me?"

375
00:25:04,667 --> 00:25:08,067
"Will you express your throbbing feelings?"

376
00:25:09,767 --> 00:25:11,667
That day, the two of us

377
00:25:11,667 --> 00:25:15,100
I don't know how to fill the gap in the past.

378
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,500
The gap between us now

379
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:20,733
Can only hug and kiss tightly

380
00:25:23,167 --> 00:25:26,900
A brief but profound memory

381
00:25:26,900 --> 00:25:29,433
Suddenly came to my mind

382
00:25:29,433 --> 00:25:31,500
(Kim Ji-hoon's 100 Questions and Answers)
Fortunately, that period was not long

383
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:34,233
Didn't become a period between us

384
00:25:34,233 --> 00:25:36,500
Just a comma

385
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:38,867
We comfort each other like this

386
00:25:38,867 --> 00:25:41,200
We have no idea

387
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,700
Good night

388
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,967
How much is left in the future? How much is left in the future?

389
00:25:44,967 --> 00:25:47,200
Waiting for us waiting for us

390
00:25:52,667 --> 00:25:54,433
Um

391
00:25:54,433 --> 00:25:56,267
Mood?

392
00:25:56,267 --> 00:25:57,800
It's okay

393
00:25:58,733 --> 00:26:00,933
I'm almost there

394
00:26:00,933 --> 00:26:02,167
good

395
00:26:04,767 --> 00:26:05,967
Yun Jae

396
00:26:07,067 --> 00:26:08,533
I miss you so much

397
00:26:09,467 --> 00:26:10,567
When did you return to Korea?

398
00:26:10,567 --> 00:26:11,900
A week ago

399
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,000
how is your day

400
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,633
Well, I miss you.

401
00:26:14,633 --> 00:26:16,467
I wanted to contact you.

402
00:26:18,233 --> 00:26:20,333
Are you free today? Today...

403
00:26:21,267 --> 00:26:23,033
You are here

404
00:26:23,033 --> 00:26:24,433
Um

405
00:26:28,967 --> 00:26:30,633
who is she

406
00:26:30,633 --> 00:26:32,167
Say hello

407
00:26:32,167 --> 00:26:33,833
This is my girlfriend, Kim Ji-eun.

408
00:26:33,833 --> 00:26:35,867
She is my junior from the same department, Jiang Minzhou

409
00:26:37,467 --> 00:26:39,633
Hello, I'm Kim Ji-eun... Yoon-jae

410
00:26:39,633 --> 00:26:42,433
Did you get a girlfriend while I was away?

411
00:26:42,433 --> 00:26:45,200
You can't wait any longer as an exchange student for only one year.

412
00:26:47,133 --> 00:26:48,400
is that so

413
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:51,000
No, I told everyone

414
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,333
I've already drooled over you and marked you as mine.

415
00:26:53,333 --> 00:26:55,600
How could you do this?

416
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:57,200
Hello

417
00:26:58,067 --> 00:27:00,433
What mark?

418
00:27:00,433 --> 00:27:02,367
Why are you talking nonsense?

419
00:27:02,367 --> 00:27:05,767
By the way, you know our department has a party on Friday, right?

420
00:27:05,767 --> 00:27:08,967
I will also help organize a welcome party, so you must come.

421
00:27:08,967 --> 00:27:11,033
Star Nightclub at the entrance of Yanxi Palace

422
00:27:11,033 --> 00:27:13,800
If you don't come, I'll call you until you come.

423
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,667
Nightclub?

424
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:19,600
What

425
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,867
That was the astronomy department's party.

426
00:27:21,867 --> 00:27:23,700
You didn't do anything wrong.

427
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:25,300
Why are you so guilty?

428
00:27:26,600 --> 00:27:29,833
If you have time, your girlfriend can come too.

429
00:27:29,833 --> 00:27:33,100
But you don't look like someone who likes this kind of place.

430
00:27:36,933 --> 00:27:38,033
That's right

431
00:27:42,767 --> 00:27:45,367
This is our department's secret.

432
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:47,667
See you on Friday

433
00:27:57,233 --> 00:27:58,667
hateful

434
00:27:59,467 --> 00:28:02,033
Great Grace

435
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:07,767
Great Grace

436
00:28:07,767 --> 00:28:09,967
Are you okay? I'm sorry.

437
00:28:09,967 --> 00:28:11,167
Let go

438
00:28:11,167 --> 00:28:12,267
Are you okay?

439
00:28:12,267 --> 00:28:13,667
I don't know what she's talking about either.

440
00:28:13,667 --> 00:28:15,767
Minjoo

441
00:28:15,767 --> 00:28:18,667
Is she really Yoon Jae's girlfriend?

442
00:28:18,667 --> 00:28:20,667
They've been dating for a while.

443
00:28:20,667 --> 00:28:22,733
He's only been hanging out with his girlfriend lately.

444
00:28:22,733 --> 00:28:25,367
Are you really dating, Zhien?

445
00:28:27,167 --> 00:28:29,100
Great Grace

446
00:28:29,100 --> 00:28:32,100
By the way, didn't you say you didn't want to go to the nightclub on Friday?

447
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:33,800
I also felt that the welcome party was very stressful.

448
00:28:33,800 --> 00:28:36,133
How about we go see a musical?

449
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:37,767
Who said I don't want to go?

450
00:28:37,767 --> 00:28:39,700
I have to go

451
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,833
You just said...

452
00:28:40,833 --> 00:28:42,300
I changed my mind

453
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,633
Suddenly I really want to go

454
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,233
I will dress up beautifully and you must come too.

455
00:28:54,300 --> 00:28:55,567
good

456
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:03,433
Great Grace

457
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:05,700
You might as well drink beer.

458
00:29:05,700 --> 00:29:09,167
Dad said you can't drink when you're in a bad mood

459
00:29:10,333 --> 00:29:13,100
What is your department's secret?

460
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,967
I was a little panicked for a moment and didn't hear clearly

461
00:29:16,967 --> 00:29:18,300
Don't worry

462
00:29:21,833 --> 00:29:23,333
I want 500 ml of beer

463
00:29:23,333 --> 00:29:26,767
Don't give me a thousand milliliters of wow fried too perfect

464
00:29:26,767 --> 00:29:29,633
Here's the chicken leg for you, enjoy it!

465
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:35,133
You are covered in other women's saliva, so eat it yourself

466
00:29:35,133 --> 00:29:36,467
Hello

467
00:29:36,467 --> 00:29:39,600
You who study Korean don't know what an idiomatic metaphor is?

468
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:41,233
It's not really saliva.

469
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:43,533
What do you really have?

470
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:44,833
No

471
00:29:44,833 --> 00:29:46,500
She usually likes to joke around.

472
00:29:46,500 --> 00:29:48,600
Get along well with everyone

473
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,700
His personality is a bit aggressive but he's not a bad person...

474
00:29:53,100 --> 00:29:55,367
Are you speaking for her in front of me?

475
00:29:55,367 --> 00:29:56,500
Great Grace

476
00:29:56,500 --> 00:30:00,200
My heart is fragile, please be gentle

477
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:03,000
So you're going clubbing on Friday?

478
00:30:03,000 --> 00:30:04,267
No

479
00:30:04,267 --> 00:30:05,500
I'm not going

480
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,833
As long as you oppose me, I won't even go to heaven.

481
00:30:07,833 --> 00:30:09,433
No, you must go

482
00:30:09,433 --> 00:30:12,567
You have to go to the club on Friday, understand?

483
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,300
Do you want to wear this?

484
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:42,200
What are you doing

485
00:30:46,033 --> 00:30:47,367
clang clang

486
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,800
What's wrong? It doesn't look good.

487
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,167
This set

488
00:30:59,933 --> 00:31:01,667
This one doesn't work either?

489
00:31:03,867 --> 00:31:05,600
So what about this?

490
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:11,700
This reminds me of taking a bath.

491
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:13,400
Do you have to go to the nightclub?

492
00:31:14,267 --> 00:31:16,067
Taking a bath?

493
00:31:17,267 --> 00:31:19,133
This set, sister

494
00:31:20,033 --> 00:31:22,467
Why are you doing this?

495
00:31:22,467 --> 00:31:24,533
This set, sister

496
00:31:24,533 --> 00:31:26,933
sister

497
00:31:26,933 --> 00:31:28,267
disuse

498
00:31:28,267 --> 00:31:29,700
That's enough.

499
00:31:29,700 --> 00:31:31,100
Feed Jin Zhihui

500
00:31:31,100 --> 00:31:32,433
Look at me

501
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,400
You really have enough hell

502
00:31:39,767 --> 00:31:40,867
sister

503
00:31:40,867 --> 00:31:42,767
Don't change it anymore.

504
00:31:46,667 --> 00:31:48,133
how

505
00:31:48,133 --> 00:31:49,367
Hello

506
00:31:50,667 --> 00:31:54,600
Simple is best. This one is the best for you.

507
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:55,533
May I

508
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:56,867
come over

509
00:31:58,900 --> 00:31:59,900
lips

510
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:03,100
OK

511
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,800
Not bad

512
00:32:08,567 --> 00:32:09,800
Thanks

513
00:32:09,800 --> 00:32:11,000
Go ahead

514
00:32:12,867 --> 00:32:14,500
They're all dead.

515
00:32:19,633 --> 00:32:21,133
Yun Jae

516
00:32:24,867 --> 00:32:26,433
Yun Jae

517
00:32:27,233 --> 00:32:28,433
You are here

518
00:32:28,433 --> 00:32:29,767
I knew you would come

519
00:32:29,767 --> 00:32:31,067
Um... let's go in

520
00:32:31,067 --> 00:32:32,667
Everyone is waiting

521
00:32:32,667 --> 00:32:34,833
Actually, I made a bet with them.

522
00:32:34,833 --> 00:32:36,867
Bet you'll come

523
00:32:37,467 --> 00:32:39,300
I bet you'll come.

524
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,567
Hey, we can drink free alcohol until dawn today

525
00:32:41,567 --> 00:32:42,800
Let's go

526
00:32:42,800 --> 00:32:46,900
No, I'm waiting for my girlfriend to come in together.

527
00:32:47,567 --> 00:32:48,800
So that's it

528
00:32:49,433 --> 00:32:51,500
Your girlfriend will come.

529
00:32:51,500 --> 00:32:53,167
Well, we have an appointment.

530
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,667
She'll come in by herself.

531
00:32:56,667 --> 00:32:58,067
Otherwise, call

532
00:32:58,067 --> 00:32:59,633
Let's go in first

533
00:32:59,633 --> 00:33:00,933
Hello

534
00:33:02,733 --> 00:33:04,167
no

535
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,267
Yunzai Yunzai

536
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:31,300
Hey, what's up, Minjoo?

537
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:32,300
I didn't expect you to come.

538
00:33:32,767 --> 00:33:33,800
Park Yun-jae

539
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,733
I looked for you before, but you never came

540
00:33:35,733 --> 00:33:37,533
Did you come when Zhou asked for you?

541
00:33:38,033 --> 00:33:39,633
Yeah, that's not the case.

542
00:33:40,700 --> 00:33:42,167
I'm going to the bathroom.

543
00:33:42,167 --> 00:33:43,767
The restroom is over there

544
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:46,500
The result is still here

545
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:48,533
How are you two?

546
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:50,233
You really are

547
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:54,433
(My Great Grace)

548
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:58,233
(Answering)

549
00:33:58,233 --> 00:33:59,700
But I didn't expect

550
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,300
As soon as I asked for Yun Jae, he came right away.

551
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:04,367
It turns out Park Yun-jae is also a man

552
00:34:04,367 --> 00:34:06,533
I also know that Minjoo is pretty

553
00:34:06,533 --> 00:34:09,367
But doesn’t Park Yun-jae have a girlfriend?

554
00:34:09,367 --> 00:34:10,133
(My Yun Jae)
Hello

555
00:34:10,133 --> 00:34:12,600
(My Yun Jae)
Didn't you see Minjoo holding his hand when he came in?

556
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,667
(My Yun Jae)
It should be a foregone conclusion.

557
00:34:14,667 --> 00:34:16,267
(End call)

558
00:34:18,267 --> 00:34:19,400
What's wrong…

559
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,500
What happened? What happened?

560
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,633
I was scared to death

561
00:34:22,033 --> 00:34:24,333
Why haven't you changed your clothes yet?

562
00:34:26,533 --> 00:34:29,000
What should I do?

563
00:34:32,733 --> 00:34:36,433
Yes, I just took Qingxin Pills.

564
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:41,533
Park Yoon-jae went to a nightclub with that vixen

565
00:34:41,533 --> 00:34:43,033
Does that matter now?

566
00:34:43,033 --> 00:34:44,633
Of course it's important.

567
00:34:46,233 --> 00:34:47,433
Now is not the time to be depressed

568
00:34:52,067 --> 00:34:53,433
Yeah, Min Hyuk is me.

569
00:34:53,433 --> 00:34:55,567
This time I have something to ask of you.

570
00:34:56,233 --> 00:34:57,767
Are you free now?

571
00:34:57,767 --> 00:35:00,800
cheers…

572
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:02,633
Drink it in one gulp

573
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,367
cheers

574
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,867
Zhien, nothing happened to you, right?

575
00:35:31,567 --> 00:35:33,633
(My Greatest Grace)
Zhien, nothing happened to you, right?

576
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,567
I miss you so much, but you don't seem to miss me at all

577
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,433
I'm glad to see you again too.

578
00:35:39,433 --> 00:35:41,400
Are you really happy?

579
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:43,000
I'm so disappointed

580
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:44,467
Excuse me

581
00:35:44,467 --> 00:35:46,533
I can't contact my girlfriend.

582
00:35:46,533 --> 00:35:47,533
Feel sorry

583
00:35:48,167 --> 00:35:50,433
If you feel sorry, drink it.

584
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:01,800
cheers

585
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,833
Brother Zhixun

586
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,333
Let's go

587
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:16,400
Kill

588
00:36:20,900 --> 00:36:22,033
Have a drink

589
00:36:22,033 --> 00:36:22,767
no

590
00:36:22,767 --> 00:36:24,167
Drink it

591
00:36:24,167 --> 00:36:26,033
cheers

592
00:36:37,367 --> 00:36:40,067
I can let you go but...

593
00:36:40,067 --> 00:36:41,667
You want to dance with me

594
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,833
What

595
00:36:46,467 --> 00:36:47,867
So cute

596
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:49,333
Let's go

597
00:37:25,500 --> 00:37:26,767
So cute

598
00:37:27,633 --> 00:37:28,967
So cute

599
00:37:37,233 --> 00:37:38,600
what

600
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,233
you…

601
00:37:44,233 --> 00:37:45,700
Are you Jiang Minzhou?

602
00:37:47,033 --> 00:37:48,567
Lee Min Hyuk

603
00:37:50,500 --> 00:37:52,000
Do you know her too?

604
00:37:53,633 --> 00:37:55,167
Brother?

605
00:37:55,167 --> 00:37:58,800
Since he's someone you know, can you please let him go?

606
00:38:12,167 --> 00:38:14,267
What is Park Yun-jae doing?

607
00:38:23,433 --> 00:38:24,333
Yun Jae

608
00:38:24,333 --> 00:38:25,767
Park Yun-jae

609
00:38:26,867 --> 00:38:27,967
What?

610
00:38:29,600 --> 00:38:31,433
sorry…

611
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,467
sorry…

612
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:43,200
I am coming

613
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:46,800
No, why are you here?

614
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:49,200
No, why is it here again?

615
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:54,467
Sorry it turned out like this.

616
00:38:54,467 --> 00:38:55,700
Hello

617
00:38:57,000 --> 00:38:58,367
haven't seen you for a long time

618
00:39:00,033 --> 00:39:02,333
So happy to see you like this

619
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:03,100
Hello

620
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:08,067
Wanna dance?

621
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:14,100
Lee Min Hyuk

622
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,600
You are here too

623
00:39:16,267 --> 00:39:19,600
Hey, let's dance, three of us.

624
00:39:22,167 --> 00:39:23,600
It doesn't jump like that.

625
00:39:25,033 --> 00:39:26,733
Feeding Hands

626
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:33,167
Good boy

627
00:39:33,167 --> 00:39:35,300
You're too drunk, get out.

628
00:39:38,033 --> 00:39:40,967
forward

629
00:39:40,967 --> 00:39:42,367
What are you doing?

630
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:43,867
husband

631
00:39:44,500 --> 00:39:46,100
What's going on?

632
00:39:47,133 --> 00:39:48,433
Eun-sook

633
00:39:48,967 --> 00:39:51,033
Yizuo is here too.

634
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:53,633
What are you doing here?

635
00:39:54,167 --> 00:39:57,200
Sorry, Yun Jae was too drunk.

636
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,233
In today's society, you can't survive if you are too clear-headed

637
00:39:59,233 --> 00:40:00,833
It's okay, Ji-hoon.

638
00:40:00,833 --> 00:40:02,067
Let him down.

639
00:40:02,067 --> 00:40:04,433
Come over here...be careful...

640
00:40:04,433 --> 00:40:06,267
Oh my god be careful...

641
00:40:09,333 --> 00:40:10,633
Thank you

642
00:40:20,967 --> 00:40:22,300
Is this outer space?

643
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:28,933
It's a state of zero gravity.

644
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:31,500
Outer space

645
00:40:32,767 --> 00:40:34,033
outer space

646
00:40:38,133 --> 00:40:40,900
I'm Armstrong

647
00:40:42,533 --> 00:40:45,667
That's one small step for a man

648
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:50,200
one giant leap for mankind

649
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,167
What nonsense are you talking about?

650
00:40:54,233 --> 00:40:55,300
Dad runs

651
00:40:55,300 --> 00:40:56,467
Run...

652
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:59,433
Mom runs

653
00:40:59,433 --> 00:41:01,600
Run... jump for what?

654
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:02,733
Everyone together

655
00:41:02,733 --> 00:41:03,767
What are you crazy about?

656
00:41:03,767 --> 00:41:06,967
How much alcohol did you drink?

657
00:41:08,067 --> 00:41:09,800
Not awake yet

658
00:41:10,133 --> 00:41:12,567
It hurts, mom.

659
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:14,600
I'm in so much pain

660
00:41:16,467 --> 00:41:18,067
Seriously

661
00:41:18,067 --> 00:41:21,567
My mom is always the same

662
00:41:22,567 --> 00:41:25,033
I always ask her to knock on the door before entering my room.

663
00:41:25,033 --> 00:41:27,100
She never remembers

664
00:41:29,133 --> 00:41:31,133
My mom's helmet hairstyle

665
00:41:31,133 --> 00:41:33,367
From the time I was born till now

666
00:41:33,367 --> 00:41:34,900
Nothing has changed

667
00:41:36,867 --> 00:41:39,000
Never changed

668
00:41:39,000 --> 00:41:40,967
I thought it was a tattoo

669
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:43,600
Don't shut up for me.

670
00:41:47,233 --> 00:41:48,933
What are you standing there for?

671
00:41:49,900 --> 00:41:52,067
You little bastard, why don't you just be quiet?

672
00:41:52,067 --> 00:41:53,100
Go away

673
00:41:55,067 --> 00:41:56,600
husband…

674
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,667
Ouch…

675
00:41:57,667 --> 00:41:59,100
Don't do this

676
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:01,500
Husband, hurry up.

677
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,400
Go back to your room

678
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,900
Mom is in pain

679
00:42:05,900 --> 00:42:08,100
It hurts.

680
00:42:14,133 --> 00:42:15,000
mom

681
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:21,267
Right

682
00:42:22,900 --> 00:42:24,000
People

683
00:42:25,967 --> 00:42:30,133
You can't become someone else overnight.

684
00:42:31,700 --> 00:42:32,533
But

685
00:42:34,533 --> 00:42:37,333
Mom, but

686
00:42:43,367 --> 00:42:45,000
Sleep well

687
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,167
Yunzai

688
00:42:50,467 --> 00:42:52,233
Park Yun-jae

689
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:18,567
Scare me

690
00:43:20,133 --> 00:43:21,367
Come out in five minutes

691
00:43:25,100 --> 00:43:25,800
good

692
00:43:29,167 --> 00:43:31,467
To cure a hangover, you need instant noodles

693
00:43:31,467 --> 00:43:33,600
This is cooked just right and eaten quickly

694
00:43:38,567 --> 00:43:40,267
Do you remember what happened yesterday?

695
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,033
I probably remember

696
00:43:45,133 --> 00:43:46,633
Your mother didn't sleep all night.

697
00:43:46,633 --> 00:43:48,067
I went to pray early in the morning

698
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,833
I'll go apologize to her.

699
00:43:53,833 --> 00:43:54,800
Good to know

700
00:43:56,567 --> 00:43:57,500
Eat quickly

701
00:43:59,533 --> 00:44:00,600
Has anything happened to you recently?

702
00:44:03,333 --> 00:44:04,933
Nothing happened

703
00:44:07,100 --> 00:44:08,433
How is your girlfriend?

704
00:44:10,967 --> 00:44:11,700
not good

705
00:44:12,433 --> 00:44:13,367
She's gone

706
00:44:17,800 --> 00:44:19,033
I mean, I don't have a girlfriend.

707
00:44:22,067 --> 00:44:24,367
The noodles are about to get mushy, so eat them quickly.

708
00:44:26,667 --> 00:44:28,067
And remember

709
00:44:28,067 --> 00:44:30,900
Be sure to apologize to the friend you brought back yesterday

710
00:44:30,900 --> 00:44:31,900
he…

711
00:44:31,900 --> 00:44:34,367
Even help you take off your clothes and take a bath

712
00:44:35,933 --> 00:44:36,833
good

713
00:44:41,533 --> 00:44:42,767
Take off your clothes and take a shower?

714
00:44:44,133 --> 00:44:45,300
He helped me wash where

715
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:48,367
Here and here...

716
00:44:49,033 --> 00:44:50,500
And... is this important?

717
00:44:50,500 --> 00:44:51,700
Of course it's important

718
00:44:53,800 --> 00:44:55,133
My figure is terrible now.

719
00:45:01,733 --> 00:45:02,500
Park Yun-jae

720
00:45:03,667 --> 00:45:05,067
Why be so depressed about this?

721
00:45:06,067 --> 00:45:07,533
It's okay.

722
00:45:07,533 --> 00:45:09,267
Hold your head high and chest out

723
00:45:09,267 --> 00:45:11,467
Boys are likely to be like this when they are drunk, Dad

724
00:45:11,467 --> 00:45:13,400
It's okay, cheer up.

725
00:45:18,833 --> 00:45:19,733
How are you

726
00:45:20,933 --> 00:45:23,233
All the students know

727
00:45:23,233 --> 00:45:25,000
Are you dating a phone scammer?

728
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:26,167
casual

729
00:45:26,167 --> 00:45:28,467
Let them say whatever they want.

730
00:45:28,467 --> 00:45:30,867
"About to arrive at Noryangjin Station"

731
00:45:31,367 --> 00:45:34,600
"Next stop is Noryangjin Station Exit 3"

732
00:46:01,333 --> 00:46:02,200
Excuse me

733
00:46:06,967 --> 00:46:09,167
(Level 9 Civil Servant Reference Book in English) by Hong Yingshuo

734
00:46:09,167 --> 00:46:10,733
Oh, thank you.

735
00:46:17,700 --> 00:46:19,333
Why do you dream of becoming a civil servant?

736
00:46:23,033 --> 00:46:24,100
Because I like a stable life

737
00:46:24,967 --> 00:46:26,100
Will not collapse

738
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:28,367
Will not change

739
00:46:29,067 --> 00:46:29,933
Why

740
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:33,533
If I had your face

741
00:46:33,533 --> 00:46:35,233
You will definitely feel that it is a pity to be just a civil servant.

742
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:38,367
There is no way to make good use of your selfish genes

743
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:40,600
So stupid

744
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:43,533
My selfish gene

745
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:45,733
Just pass it on to the next generation

746
00:46:46,900 --> 00:46:47,833
Me

747
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,700
Want to have three children

748
00:46:50,533 --> 00:46:51,567
Three?

749
00:46:53,600 --> 00:46:54,433
Three?

750
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,033
Three...

751
00:47:00,033 --> 00:47:02,567
If you want to raise three children

752
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:03,967
I have to go out to work and earn money.

753
00:47:04,733 --> 00:47:05,333
What

754
00:47:05,333 --> 00:47:07,500
It will be very difficult for you to make money on your own

755
00:47:14,700 --> 00:47:17,167
What I mean is…

756
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,433
You just be a housewife.

757
00:47:18,433 --> 00:47:20,400
I will become a civil servant who earns a lot of money

758
00:47:25,967 --> 00:47:26,633
Let's go

759
00:47:51,233 --> 00:47:52,200
yes…

760
00:47:53,500 --> 00:47:54,567
Hong Young-suk

761
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:11,167
My Zhien: I didn’t answer the phone… Call me when you’re done.

762
00:48:25,233 --> 00:48:26,167
Mom asked me to give it to you

763
00:48:26,833 --> 00:48:28,600
It's a detoxifying juice made from spinach.

764
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:31,767
You made such a fuss yesterday

765
00:48:31,767 --> 00:48:33,867
Mom still loves her son very much

766
00:48:34,467 --> 00:48:35,300
Drink it

767
00:48:41,867 --> 00:48:43,000
Ji-hoon is angry, right?

768
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:47,533
How do you know?

769
00:48:50,733 --> 00:48:53,233
My singing is terrible, right?

770
00:48:53,233 --> 00:48:54,700
And what kind of dance?

771
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,567
Why don't you stop me?

772
00:48:57,567 --> 00:48:59,767
What are you talking about? It's not because of that incident.

773
00:49:00,433 --> 00:49:02,033
Isn't it

774
00:49:02,033 --> 00:49:02,967
That…

775
00:49:05,100 --> 00:49:07,500
Is it because he bathed me?

776
00:49:08,933 --> 00:49:09,900
Don't you remember?

777
00:49:13,433 --> 00:49:16,633
I originally recorded the video to record your dark history.

778
00:49:17,967 --> 00:49:19,033
But I shot this

779
00:49:20,467 --> 00:49:21,633
See for yourself

780
00:49:21,633 --> 00:49:22,967
"Dad jumps up"

781
00:49:22,967 --> 00:49:24,033
"Mom jumps up"

782
00:49:26,033 --> 00:49:26,967
Hello…

783
00:49:26,967 --> 00:49:28,367
Hello, what is this?

784
00:49:28,367 --> 00:49:29,067
Is it me?

785
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:31,233
Are you really totally unimpressed?

786
00:49:32,133 --> 00:49:33,033
right

787
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:35,300
How is this?

788
00:49:38,100 --> 00:49:39,667
Just start from here

789
00:49:39,667 --> 00:49:40,600
here

790
00:50:05,567 --> 00:50:07,233
Drink some honey water, Park Yun-jae

791
00:50:09,400 --> 00:50:11,000
Wake up!

792
00:50:12,333 --> 00:50:14,933
How can people change?

793
00:50:17,667 --> 00:50:19,733
But it changed again

794
00:50:21,767 --> 00:50:22,633
I said

795
00:50:23,700 --> 00:50:29,000
I can't suddenly become another person like my mom.

796
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,733
But why did you suddenly become Zhixun?

797
00:50:38,333 --> 00:50:40,233
Suddenly become Zhien

798
00:50:43,833 --> 00:50:45,400
Why did you suddenly become a boy?

799
00:50:47,767 --> 00:50:49,233
Suddenly become a girl

800
00:50:51,500 --> 00:50:52,633
how so

801
00:50:55,067 --> 00:50:55,900
Why

802
00:50:57,567 --> 00:50:58,733
Why is this happening?

803
00:51:00,200 --> 00:51:02,767
Why…

804
00:51:04,900 --> 00:51:06,967
Keep playing with my heart

805
00:51:11,133 --> 00:51:12,567
No, this is just me dreaming.

806
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:15,900
It turned out to be a dream

807
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:20,767
But it will hurt

808
00:51:21,933 --> 00:51:25,533
It hurts when I pinch it. This is not a dream.

809
00:51:35,700 --> 00:51:36,900
Sorry, Yun Jae

810
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:40,500
I seem too selfish.

811
00:51:43,633 --> 00:51:44,400
sorry

812
00:51:48,333 --> 00:51:50,033
"It's not a dream"

813
00:51:50,033 --> 00:51:54,700
"You become more vivid"

814
00:51:54,700 --> 00:51:58,100
"I heard you"

815
00:52:01,833 --> 00:52:02,800
Really

816
00:52:02,800 --> 00:52:06,867
"Remember, I promise you."

817
00:52:06,867 --> 00:52:09,033
"Anytime"

818
00:52:09,667 --> 00:52:11,367
Even we think this is outrageous.

819
00:52:11,367 --> 00:52:13,033
How panicked she must be

820
00:52:14,000 --> 00:52:17,100
She'll come back when she calms down.

821
00:52:17,100 --> 00:52:19,133
Maybe it's because of me

822
00:52:19,133 --> 00:52:23,167
Because I was drunk yesterday and said something I shouldn't have said

823
00:52:26,200 --> 00:52:28,300
I understand

824
00:52:29,500 --> 00:52:34,067
You should take this opportunity to reconsider it.

825
00:52:34,067 --> 00:52:35,267
What

826
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:39,567
It's not that...

827
00:52:39,567 --> 00:52:41,533
If you have something to consider

828
00:52:41,533 --> 00:52:46,633
Zhien shouldn't have any strange ideas, right?

829
00:52:46,633 --> 00:52:49,267
Don't worry too much. Give her some time.

830
00:52:49,267 --> 00:52:52,733
Jin Zhien will definitely come back soon after shaking off the haze

831
00:53:38,667 --> 00:53:40,333
There is a typo here

832
00:53:42,700 --> 00:53:44,333
Be more focused

833
00:53:47,133 --> 00:53:49,300
Sorry for what you said

834
00:53:49,300 --> 00:53:50,933
There is a typo here

835
00:53:51,867 --> 00:53:54,767
You see, the coordinates here are different.

836
00:53:54,767 --> 00:53:55,600
Yes

837
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:57,500
Redo it

838
00:53:57,500 --> 00:53:58,867
good

839
00:55:11,267 --> 00:55:13,700
Did you forget that you found it here successfully?

840
00:55:13,700 --> 00:55:15,467
Of course

841
00:55:15,467 --> 00:55:17,800
It's not some other place, how could I forget this place?

842
00:55:17,800 --> 00:55:20,867
This is where we first met

843
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:25,167
Are you doing well?

844
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,733
Well, I am...

845
00:55:29,733 --> 00:55:32,133
Seriously reflect on yourself

846
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:37,867
that…

847
00:55:37,867 --> 00:55:40,100
I'm sorry that things weren't so pleasant.

848
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,467
I won't drink so much anymore.

849
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:46,133
There's a famous spicy rice cake shop nearby.

850
00:55:46,133 --> 00:55:47,600
Do you want to eat?

851
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:51,367
Yunzai

852
00:55:53,533 --> 00:55:56,733
I think it's a good idea to end where I started

853
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:02,600
It seems that as long as this is done, the good memories at the beginning

854
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:06,300
The painful memories at the end can be offset

855
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,133
Park Yun-jae

856
00:56:11,800 --> 00:56:13,933
Let's break up

857
00:56:18,800 --> 00:56:20,833
During this time, I didn't want to break up with you.

858
00:56:20,833 --> 00:56:23,833
I only think about myself. I'm sorry.

859
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,900
but…

860
00:56:26,900 --> 00:56:30,567
I don't want to use a strange face that will hurt others anymore

861
00:56:32,300 --> 00:56:34,900
Keep hurting the ones I love

862
00:56:35,933 --> 00:56:37,300
If it was because of that day

863
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:38,900
I just drank too much.

864
00:56:38,900 --> 00:56:40,633
It's not because of you

865
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:45,167
Now it's different from when I first became a boy

866
00:56:46,267 --> 00:56:48,933
I thought it would only happen once.

867
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:54,933
But now even I don’t know what I will become in the future

868
00:56:57,467 --> 00:56:58,700
but…

869
00:57:00,467 --> 00:57:03,567
I still want to continue dating you in this situation.

870
00:57:06,533 --> 00:57:08,867
I'm too selfish.

871
00:57:15,000 --> 00:57:18,767
Have you thought about it seriously?

872
00:57:23,833 --> 00:57:25,200
Um

873
00:57:36,067 --> 00:57:37,467
us…

874
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:40,700
Do you want to play a game?

875
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,433
Don't you think I've become stronger?

876
00:57:58,333 --> 00:58:00,900
I play games every day when you are not around

877
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:04,500
It's really nice

878
00:58:05,467 --> 00:58:07,167
The last time I played this game

879
00:58:07,167 --> 00:58:10,533
Even if it was just a game, I couldn't protect you.

880
00:58:11,667 --> 00:58:14,367
I don't like seeing you die.

881
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:18,267
It's just a game, aren't you getting too caught up in it?

882
00:58:18,267 --> 00:58:21,033
Yeah, I'm funny.

883
00:58:24,033 --> 00:58:25,767
Then I'll be honest.

884
00:58:26,767 --> 00:58:30,100
I feel sorry and embarrassed that you have become a boy

885
00:58:30,100 --> 00:58:31,233
I know

886
00:58:31,233 --> 00:58:34,433
Become stronger and taller than me

887
00:58:34,433 --> 00:58:36,467
Actually, it’s a bit unpleasant

888
00:58:36,467 --> 00:58:38,800
That's why we broke up.

889
00:58:38,800 --> 00:58:41,400
No, not yet.

890
00:58:43,033 --> 00:58:45,567
Wait, someone's shooting at us.

891
00:58:46,433 --> 00:58:48,000
You get in the car first

892
00:58:52,800 --> 00:58:54,967
Why not?

893
00:58:54,967 --> 00:58:57,700
You turned into a boy overnight

894
00:58:57,700 --> 00:59:00,600
Do I have to give up overnight?

895
00:59:00,600 --> 00:59:02,200
That's not what I meant.

896
00:59:02,200 --> 00:59:03,533
Park Yun-jae, you really are...

897
00:59:03,533 --> 00:59:07,933
Although I never even dreamed that you would become a boy

898
00:59:07,933 --> 00:59:10,700
But I don't want to lose you

899
00:59:10,700 --> 00:59:14,100
So let's keep it like this for now.

900
00:59:18,500 --> 00:59:21,300
I don't want your life to become complicated because of me.

901
00:59:24,700 --> 00:59:28,467
In the end, my dad still supported my mom.

902
00:59:28,467 --> 00:59:30,133
He once said that if it weren't for my mother

903
00:59:30,133 --> 00:59:32,867
His life will be more tiring.

904
00:59:33,733 --> 00:59:35,200
He said this is the reason to support my mother

905
00:59:35,200 --> 00:59:36,800
But I thought so too

906
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,033
If I miss you

907
00:59:40,033 --> 00:59:42,900
My life will become tiring and empty

908
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:47,900
Someone shot at us.

909
00:59:49,233 --> 00:59:50,667
Where

910
00:59:51,233 --> 00:59:53,800
If we don't get out of the car, we'll both die.

911
00:59:53,800 --> 00:59:57,633
If we don't split up now, we'll all die.

912
00:59:57,633 --> 01:00:00,567
Damn it, stop driving recklessly and get out of the car.

913
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:03,633
The kid who doesn't even have a driver's license loves to pretend to be an expert in the game

914
01:00:03,633 --> 01:00:05,200
I'm here for a date.

915
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,667
"I see your eyes"

916
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:12,167
"Full of tears"

917
01:00:12,167 --> 01:00:15,100
"It won't shed anymore."

918
01:00:15,100 --> 01:00:18,600
"So believe me"

919
01:00:19,800 --> 01:00:21,300
Although I don't know what will happen in the future

920
01:00:21,300 --> 01:00:23,033
But for us...

921
01:00:23,033 --> 01:00:26,567
Not for me

922
01:00:26,567 --> 01:00:28,800
Decided to maintain the status quo

923
01:00:33,233 --> 01:00:34,367
Knocked down

924
01:00:36,633 --> 01:00:38,167
I'll become stronger.

925
01:00:41,500 --> 01:00:44,333
(Postscript)

926
01:00:47,067 --> 01:00:48,867
(Kim Ji-hye and Hong Young-seok)

927
01:00:48,867 --> 01:00:51,000
It hasn't changed at all.

928
01:01:08,767 --> 01:01:10,767
Lovers

929
01:01:24,033 --> 01:01:25,900
"Cause I love you"

930
01:01:25,900 --> 01:01:29,200
"Would you like to tell me?"

931
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:33,733
"Will you express your throbbing feelings?"

932
01:01:33,733 --> 01:01:38,867
"I always laugh for no reason."

933
01:01:38,867 --> 01:01:42,367
"It's because of you"

934
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:46,133
"Can you hear my heartbeat?"

935
01:01:46,133 --> 01:01:47,600
"Leaping towards you"

936
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:51,500
My girlfriend is more handsome than me.

937
01:01:51,933 --> 01:01:53,500
I also want to go to school

938
01:01:53,500 --> 01:01:55,200
If it hadn't happened to my daughter

939
01:01:55,200 --> 01:01:57,267
It's simply unimaginable.

940
01:01:57,267 --> 01:01:59,400
Yun Jae and his friends will come to my house

941
01:01:59,400 --> 01:02:00,300
Perfect

942
01:02:00,300 --> 01:02:01,700
You are absolutely my ideal lover.

943
01:02:01,700 --> 01:02:03,733
How long have you known each other?

944
01:02:03,733 --> 01:02:04,867
453 days

945
01:02:04,867 --> 01:02:06,467
Do you still count the days we've known each other?

946
01:02:06,467 --> 01:02:07,700
You are here

947
01:02:07,700 --> 01:02:09,367
I'm really tired

948
01:02:10,133 --> 01:02:12,833
Park Yun-jae, are you possessed by a demon?

949
01:02:12,833 --> 01:02:15,000
Yuri is going to sleep at my house today

950
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:19,633
Don't you know how careful I am not to fall for you?
