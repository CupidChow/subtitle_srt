The one that touched you the most was "The Birth and Death of the Universe".

31
00:03:21,522 --> 00:03:26,389
My boyfriend, who is studying astronomy, recommended me

32
00:03:26,389 --> 00:03:30,456
I read the novel The Birth and Death of the Universe

36
00:03:40,456 --> 00:03:43,189
(Ji-eun and Yun-jae's hiking schedule)
I finally understood the meaning of this book.

37
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:46,389
What is it

38
00:03:46,389 --> 00:03:49,289
Love is Love

39
00:03:49,289 --> 00:03:51,489
It's the beginning of all events

40
00:03:52,189 --> 00:03:53,689
Judging from the contents of the book

41
00:03:53,689 --> 00:03:59,322
All events are caused by the protagonist falling in love with someone

42
00:03:59,322 --> 00:04:04,122
If he doesn't love, nothing will happen.

43
00:04:04,122 --> 00:04:07,422
So let’s be brave and love today

44
00:04:07,422 --> 00:04:09,189

51
00:04:46,889 --> 00:04:48,456

52
00:04:48,456 --> 00:04:51,156
Thanks to Jin Zhien, I have the opportunity to come to this place

It hurts. That's a really old-fashioned way of saying it.

Stop talking.

Can't you just pretend you didn't see it and go in?

93
00:08:04,122 --> 00:08:06,156
No, isn't it better to do it in a cool place?

94
00:08:06,156 --> 00:08:08,422

I'm leaving. I'll call you later.

99

100
00:08:27,422 --> 00:08:28,522

Why are you doing this?

104
00:08:34,122 --> 00:08:35,689
Ask him to come in and kiss him

105
00:08:41,989 --> 00:08:44,556
When was this given to me?

106
00:08:52,489 --> 00:08:54,322
You'll die if you drink all of it.

107
00:08:54,322 --> 00:08:58,056
Wouldn't that be great? You don't have to get old and you don't have to make money.

108

What's wrong? Is there anything wrong?

111
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:11,956
Why are you asking this question? When did your sister get well?

112
00:09:15,989 --> 00:09:18,722
If you want to do this, just turn it all over.

113

It's faster to look at the pattern.

114

00:09:25,656 --> 00:09:28,889
This is the first time I picked this card

Can you knock on the door?

125
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:17,822
What are you doing in the middle of the night?

126
00:10:19,822 --> 00:10:21,456

Have my shoulders become broader?

130
00:10:31,022 --> 00:10:32,489
The shit is about to come out

131
00:10:32,489 --> 00:10:33,889
Take a look

132
00:10:36,689 --> 00:10:38,089
How about it

133
00:10:40,022 --> 00:10:42,556
It seems to have widened.

134
00:10:43,356 --> 00:10:44,722
but…

135
00:10:44,722 --> 00:10:45,756
But what

136
00:10:45,756 --> 00:10:48,156
The face seems to have become wider as well.

137
00:10:48,156 --> 00:10:49,556
Don't waste your energy.

138
00:10:56,056 --> 00:10:57,622

Is this situation in the store okay?

145
00:11:53,989 --> 00:11:59,022
Work-study student, do you know the name of this building?

146
00:11:59,889 --> 00:12:01,322
I seem to know

148
00:12:04,389 --> 00:12:05,856
Sadako Building

149
00:12:05,856 --> 00:12:08,189
A very memorable name so I remember it.

150
00:12:09,622 --> 00:12:11,122
etc.

151
00:12:11,122 --> 00:12:13,022
The boss lady has the same name as you.

152
00:12:13,022 --> 00:12:15,122
My mother took it.

153
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:18,122
My name and the building's name are

154
00:12:20,122 --> 00:12:21,822
So the boss lady

155
00:12:21,822 --> 00:12:25,089
Are you the legendary landlord's daughter?

156
00:12:40,089 --> 00:12:41,556
Damn deadlines

157
00:12:44,322 --> 00:12:48,356
Yuri writer, where are you?

158
00:12:51,222 --> 00:12:52,522
Not here

159
00:13:00,522 --> 00:13:01,422
I was scared to death

160
00:13:02,256 --> 00:13:03,356
What are you doing?

161
00:13:04,289 --> 00:13:05,922
The deadline is approaching

162
00:13:06,622 --> 00:13:10,056
But I'm totally uninspired so I'm punishing myself

163
00:13:11,789 --> 00:13:13,022
Great Grace

164
00:13:15,156 --> 00:13:18,289
I really don't seem to have the qualifications to be a writer

165
00:13:18,289 --> 00:13:19,689
Really…

166
00:13:19,689 --> 00:13:21,422
Come out quickly.

167
00:13:21,422 --> 00:13:24,089
What is a two-day and one-night trip?

168
00:13:25,022 --> 00:13:27,522
My friend was in a life-or-death situation due to deadlines

169
00:13:27,522 --> 00:13:29,189
Are you going on a trip with your boyfriend?

170
00:13:30,722 --> 00:13:33,256
No wonder some people say making friends is useless

171
00:13:33,256 --> 00:13:36,156
But speaking of traveling…

172
00:13:36,156 --> 00:13:39,722
It seems like Yoon Jae has done a lot of preparation

173
00:13:40,389 --> 00:13:42,822
I feel a little sorry that I was only responsible for being there

174
00:13:42,822 --> 00:13:44,956
What's wrong with just being there?

175
00:13:44,956 --> 00:13:46,756
That's the most important thing.

176
00:13:46,756 --> 00:13:48,022
What's the meaning

177
00:13:48,789 --> 00:13:49,956
Wait me a moment

178
00:13:56,589 --> 00:13:57,822
this…

179
00:13:58,489 --> 00:14:00,822
What is this?

180
00:14:01,389 --> 00:14:04,589
You have to protect your own body

181
00:14:06,422 --> 00:14:09,156
Hey, what are you thinking about?

182
00:14:09,156 --> 00:14:10,722
We didn't do that.

183
00:14:11,389 --> 00:14:13,889
Adult men and women who love each other to death

184
00:14:13,889 --> 00:14:15,056
We're going on a trip together.

185
00:14:15,056 --> 00:14:17,222
Is it possible not to do that?

186
00:14:17,222 --> 00:14:19,189
Of course it is...

187
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:20,622
The purpose of this journey

188
00:14:21,289 --> 00:14:22,922
The Long Night

189
00:14:22,922 --> 00:14:24,822
I want to pick stars with you

190
00:14:31,789 --> 00:14:33,322
Compared to temporary can not find

191
00:14:33,322 --> 00:14:35,256
It's safer to carry it with you.

192
00:14:36,656 --> 00:14:37,922
Put it in your bag quickly

193
00:14:43,589 --> 00:14:44,989
but…

194
00:14:44,989 --> 00:14:48,089
How can you, a single woman, have such a thing?

195
00:14:48,089 --> 00:14:49,789
I am a person who writes a suicide note every day

196
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,422
I might die tomorrow.

197
00:14:52,422 --> 00:14:53,822
What's the point of preparing a condom?

198
00:14:54,256 --> 00:14:57,156
I wish I was that proactive in submitting my manuscript.

199
00:14:59,089 --> 00:15:00,722
Bad Woman

200
00:15:00,722 --> 00:15:02,556
(The Goddess's Private Life)

201
00:15:03,456 --> 00:15:05,322
It's written so well yet you still sigh.

202
00:15:07,189 --> 00:15:10,722
This Choi Yu-ri has the talent of a devil

203
00:15:13,522 --> 00:15:15,422
(Nyver College Student Online Novel Competition)

204
00:15:23,256 --> 00:15:24,422
Hey Yun Jae

205
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:30,089
How come there is this car?

206
00:15:31,456 --> 00:15:34,356
It's actually our boss lady's.

207
00:15:34,356 --> 00:15:36,356
I said I wanted to travel with you, so she lent it to me.

208
00:15:36,356 --> 00:15:37,256
Great, right?

209
00:15:37,256 --> 00:15:39,056
The cafe owner?

210
00:15:39,989 --> 00:15:41,589
but…

211
00:15:42,089 --> 00:15:45,456
Why would you lend such an expensive car to a part-time student for no reason?

212
00:15:46,122 --> 00:15:49,822
Is it because I am usually hardworking and honest?

213
00:15:51,122 --> 00:15:54,589
But what if it gets scratched?

214
00:15:54,589 --> 00:15:55,889
Very uneasy

215
00:15:55,889 --> 00:15:57,356
Leave it to me

216
00:15:59,156 --> 00:16:01,356
And even if you’re uneasy…

217
00:16:02,056 --> 00:16:04,922
The transaction is complete and there is no going back.

218
00:16:05,589 --> 00:16:07,789
What about the landlord's daughter?

219
00:16:07,789 --> 00:16:09,222
I don't have a boyfriend.

220
00:16:12,156 --> 00:16:15,822
The boss's wife's real estate is much better than my boyfriend's.

221
00:16:15,822 --> 00:16:18,789
Really? Then do you want to date me?

222
00:16:18,789 --> 00:16:21,989
Once I own it, I own the building.

223
00:16:27,022 --> 00:16:29,689
I suddenly thought of a brother I knew

224
00:16:29,689 --> 00:16:31,156
Is he handsome?

225
00:16:33,989 --> 00:16:35,789
Although this is a photo from five years ago

226
00:16:35,789 --> 00:16:38,322
But he's really handsome.

227
00:16:38,322 --> 00:16:41,256
Not only is she tall, but her voice is also very attractive.

228
00:16:41,256 --> 00:16:43,122
The hardware is pretty good.

229
00:16:45,789 --> 00:16:46,956
But the boss lady

230
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:48,956
This brother is still unemployed

231
00:16:48,956 --> 00:16:50,356
Give me the number

232
00:16:52,089 --> 00:16:55,989
Wow, it turns out your boss lady is also a member of the Appearance Association

233
00:16:55,989 --> 00:16:57,556
Exactly like my sister.

234
00:16:58,222 --> 00:17:00,122
Yes, your sister too.

235
00:17:00,122 --> 00:17:02,322
She should have been more anxious.

236
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:04,456
That's right

237
00:17:08,556 --> 00:17:10,989
I don't think we'll be interrupted today.

238
00:17:14,856 --> 00:17:18,856
My sister drank a lot yesterday and is now lying flat

239
00:17:33,956 --> 00:17:35,822
Come in and kiss me

240
00:17:43,122 --> 00:17:45,189
How are you, Ji-eun's sister?

241
00:17:45,822 --> 00:17:47,456
Sister, are you a pervert?

242
00:17:47,456 --> 00:17:48,756
Why do you keep peeping?

243
00:17:48,756 --> 00:17:51,822
Who told you to be so conspicuous? Otherwise, just be more restrained.

244
00:17:52,656 --> 00:17:55,356
What's in your hand?

245
00:17:55,356 --> 00:17:57,256
Is that a cigarette?

246
00:17:57,256 --> 00:17:58,922
Are you smoking again?

247
00:17:58,922 --> 00:18:00,689
Be careful or I'll tell dad about it

248
00:18:01,922 --> 00:18:04,456
This is a cotton swab.

249
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:07,289
Really comfortable

250
00:18:07,756 --> 00:18:10,056
Okay, enjoy it slowly.

251
00:18:13,956 --> 00:18:15,389
Really…

252
00:19:36,689 --> 00:19:37,822
It must be delicious

253
00:19:39,989 --> 00:19:40,822
Sit down

254
00:19:40,822 --> 00:19:43,156
What? Aren't you going camping?

255
00:19:43,156 --> 00:19:44,389
How is hair

256
00:19:44,989 --> 00:19:46,822
What do you mean? What happened?

257
00:19:48,522 --> 00:19:49,956
Did you wear perfume?

258
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:52,056
Very suspicious

259
00:19:52,622 --> 00:19:54,989
I'm not suspicious at all, okay?

260
00:19:54,989 --> 00:19:57,222
This is too suspicious. Stop bickering.

261
00:19:57,222 --> 00:19:58,522
Let’s eat first

262
00:19:59,256 --> 00:20:01,156
Husband, let's start

263
00:20:02,422 --> 00:20:03,789
Let’s pray together

264
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:10,689
Today our eldest son Park Yun-jae is going on a trip with his girlfriend

265
00:20:11,222 --> 00:20:14,922
I hope they have a safe and happy journey.

266
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:18,456
May the Father be with them, Lord.

267
00:20:19,156 --> 00:20:21,189
Amen

268
00:20:22,389 --> 00:20:25,122
Dad, wait, what are you talking about?

269
00:20:25,122 --> 00:20:26,889
Let’s get started

270
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:28,589
Wait...Yun-Ah...

271
00:20:28,589 --> 00:20:31,389
Have you inquired about the online fiction writing academy?

272
00:20:31,389 --> 00:20:32,889
Yes, I'll go ask around later.

273
00:20:32,889 --> 00:20:34,656
Mom, wait a minute.

274
00:20:34,656 --> 00:20:36,056
Let me tell you first…

275
00:20:36,056 --> 00:20:37,556
Wife

276
00:20:37,556 --> 00:20:40,622
Today's soup is so refreshing. It's cooked so well.

277
00:20:42,456 --> 00:20:43,989
Yunzai, you eat more

278
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:45,356
Eat enough to have strength

279
00:20:45,356 --> 00:20:46,722
Yes, eat more

280
00:20:46,722 --> 00:20:48,456
Eat some meat too

281
00:20:48,456 --> 00:20:50,356
Eat more, etc.

282
00:20:50,356 --> 00:20:52,289
Why should I have strength?

283
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:56,156
Eat some meat, listen to me.

284
00:20:56,156 --> 00:20:57,522
Parents

285
00:20:57,522 --> 00:20:59,689
I didn't do that.

286
00:21:00,556 --> 00:21:04,222
I really went camping.

287
00:22:22,956 --> 00:22:24,589
This is outrageous…

288
00:22:36,356 --> 00:22:37,889
what to do

289
00:22:41,922 --> 00:22:43,922
right

290
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:45,422
I must be dreaming

291
00:22:54,289 --> 00:22:55,656
Why don't you knock on the door...

292
00:22:57,222 --> 00:22:59,289
Sorry, I'll be fine soon.

293
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:16,022
Hey, your clothes are getting too small.

294
00:23:16,022 --> 00:23:17,789
My butt is about to get stuck

295
00:23:18,689 --> 00:23:20,122
LOL

296
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:24,622
That's why I told you to use the dryer less.

297
00:23:25,578 --> 00:23:27,511
I think you've gained weight.

298
00:24:05,232 --> 00:24:06,999
Then I'll go out first.

299
00:24:14,545 --> 00:24:17,078
Who are you you pervert

300
00:24:17,078 --> 00:24:18,945
Where did you run from?

301
00:24:18,945 --> 00:24:21,345
Look at me, you little bastard

302
00:24:21,345 --> 00:24:24,678
It's so hot, you pervert

303
00:24:25,412 --> 00:24:26,678
It's me

304
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:28,578
It's me

305
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:31,512
Help

306
00:24:31,512 --> 00:24:32,845
It's me

307
00:24:32,845 --> 00:24:36,445
Help!

308
00:24:58,912 --> 00:25:01,578
I am Zhien

309
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:03,712
Kim Ji-eun, your sister

310
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:08,445
I'm just a sister.

311
00:25:08,445 --> 00:25:10,945
I am that sister.

312
00:25:12,178 --> 00:25:13,578
I understand

313
00:25:13,578 --> 00:25:15,245
This is a dream, right?

314
00:25:16,145 --> 00:25:18,812
Since it's a dream, do you want to kiss me?

315
00:25:22,744 --> 00:25:24,978
Can you wake up a little?

316
00:25:28,245 --> 00:25:31,878
Sister, now I am in your eyes

317
00:25:31,878 --> 00:25:33,778
Looks like a boy, right?

318
00:25:33,778 --> 00:25:34,978
Sister?

319
00:25:36,478 --> 00:25:37,812
You see clearly

320
00:25:38,645 --> 00:25:40,878
I am Zhien

321
00:25:40,878 --> 00:25:42,745
Kim Chi-eun

322
00:25:42,745 --> 00:25:44,578
Your sister

323
00:25:48,845 --> 00:25:51,978
Great Grace…

324
00:25:54,212 --> 00:25:56,312
to…

325
00:26:01,578 --> 00:26:03,245
Great Grace

326
00:26:03,245 --> 00:26:05,612
My sister is here to save you.

327
00:26:05,612 --> 00:26:07,978
Where are you Zhien

328
00:26:07,978 --> 00:26:11,112
Zhien, where are you?

329
00:26:11,112 --> 00:26:12,778
Great Grace

330
00:26:15,489 --> 00:26:22,655
Because I was trained by my parents when I was a child

331
00:26:22,655 --> 00:26:26,055
I can tolerate this ridiculous situation now.

332
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:29,055
But I'm actually thinking

333
00:26:29,055 --> 00:26:32,055
Should we call the police?

334
00:26:32,055 --> 00:26:33,789
If you want to call the police, just do it.

335
00:26:33,789 --> 00:26:36,055
I also want to know what will happen

336
00:26:38,988 --> 00:26:41,588
Can you bring your legs together?

337
00:26:49,034 --> 00:26:50,667
To be honest

338
00:26:50,667 --> 00:26:53,234
Is this situation reasonable now?

339
00:26:53,656 --> 00:26:56,023
My ordinary sister

340
00:26:56,023 --> 00:26:58,423
He became a flower boy overnight

341
00:26:58,423 --> 00:27:02,489
Where is your focus?

342
00:27:02,489 --> 00:27:06,289
The question is, can an ordinary little sister become a flower boy?

343
00:27:06,289 --> 00:27:08,889
No

344
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:10,623
What I mean is

345
00:27:12,456 --> 00:27:16,456
Why are you so rude when you first meet me?

346
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:21,256
That's right

347
00:27:23,156 --> 00:27:24,623
What on earth do you want to do?

348
00:27:24,623 --> 00:27:26,489
I really want to call the police

349
00:27:26,489 --> 00:27:28,989
Don't come near me I warned you

350
00:27:28,989 --> 00:27:30,789
I'm really going to call the police. Look at this.

351
00:27:30,789 --> 00:27:32,123
Don't come over

352
00:27:32,123 --> 00:27:33,823
I really want to call the police

353
00:27:33,823 --> 00:27:35,889
Jin Zhihui, look carefully

354
00:27:51,389 --> 00:27:53,156
Although it is unbelievable

355
00:27:53,156 --> 00:27:55,389
But if it's as my parents said

356
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:58,089
We really had that happen.

357
00:27:58,089 --> 00:27:59,989
Let's confirm this first.

358
00:27:59,989 --> 00:28:01,423
After confirmation

359
00:28:01,423 --> 00:28:04,889
Support and believe in each other no matter what

360
00:28:04,889 --> 00:28:06,223
Until it is restored

361
00:28:06,223 --> 00:28:07,989
but

362
00:28:07,989 --> 00:28:10,189
What if this disappears too?

363
00:28:13,156 --> 00:28:15,423
I didn't consider this.

364
00:28:15,423 --> 00:28:17,523
We'll see what happens then.

365
00:28:17,523 --> 00:28:18,889
Do you know

366
00:28:18,889 --> 00:28:20,356
good

367
00:28:20,356 --> 00:28:21,889
So cute

368
00:28:27,723 --> 00:28:29,356
Luckily this is still there

369
00:28:29,356 --> 00:28:33,556
Why do you have this tattoo on your shoulder?

370
00:28:33,556 --> 00:28:35,221
what do I do

371
00:28:35,322 --> 00:28:37,388
What should I do?

372
00:28:37,388 --> 00:28:38,455
That's ridiculous.

373
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:41,355
I keep saying this is too outrageous

374
00:28:41,355 --> 00:28:43,088
Are you really Kim Ji-eun?

375
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:44,922
yes

376
00:28:54,155 --> 00:28:55,688
etc.

377
00:28:55,688 --> 00:28:58,055
What's wrong? It's scary.

378
00:28:58,055 --> 00:29:00,188
I really can't help it

379
00:29:01,388 --> 00:29:05,455
In fact, I have been enduring

380
00:29:08,022 --> 00:29:08,955
Oh my god

381
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,322
Hey, no, really not.

382
00:29:10,322 --> 00:29:11,955
I can't

383
00:29:11,955 --> 00:29:13,755
what to do

384
00:29:13,755 --> 00:29:15,955
I want to go to the toilet

385
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,088
what to do

386
00:29:19,088 --> 00:29:21,355
The one below is probably the boy's.

387
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:23,355
I don't dare to see what to do

388
00:29:23,355 --> 00:29:25,622
Can you help me please

389
00:29:25,622 --> 00:29:27,022
Are you crazy?

390
00:29:27,022 --> 00:29:28,855
I have to pee

391
00:29:28,855 --> 00:29:30,588
Letting go

392
00:29:30,588 --> 00:29:32,288
OMG

393
00:29:32,288 --> 00:29:34,722
How can I help you go to the toilet?

394
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,467
for you

395
00:29:45,500 --> 00:29:47,734
Why do you insist on coming here?

396
00:29:47,734 --> 00:29:49,734
Haven't you been sending messages?

397
00:29:49,734 --> 00:29:52,167
Is Zhien seriously ill?

398
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,400
Super serious

399
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,834
I felt dizzy after taking the medicine.

400
00:29:55,834 --> 00:29:57,234
Sister Zhihui

401
00:29:57,234 --> 00:30:00,134
This is the first time she does this and I'm really worried

402
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:02,134
Can I go in and see her?

403
00:30:02,134 --> 00:30:03,067
No, absolutely not.

404
00:30:03,067 --> 00:30:05,734
Really not. You can't kill me.

405
00:30:10,334 --> 00:30:13,700
I hate it when someone comes into my house.

406
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,700
The weather is so hot, come in and kiss me

407
00:30:17,700 --> 00:30:19,634
Come in and kiss me

408
00:30:21,334 --> 00:30:23,167
I am a person who depends on my mood.

409
00:30:24,334 --> 00:30:26,867
Anyway, today is really not possible

410
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:37,400
Drive carefully

411
00:30:40,467 --> 00:30:43,634
It will be fine in a moment. It really won't work.

412
00:30:43,634 --> 00:30:45,667
Watch your feet

413
00:30:48,267 --> 00:30:49,934
Fasten your seat belts

414
00:30:55,567 --> 00:30:57,434
What should I do?

415
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:01,334
what to do

416
00:31:04,834 --> 00:31:06,267
Excuse me

417
00:31:06,267 --> 00:31:07,434
this

418
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:11,100
I think you need it, so I bought it back.

419
00:31:14,834 --> 00:31:16,200
have a good rest

420
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:25,100
(My Yun Jae: I don’t think you have a cold. If it’s serious, do you want to go to the hospital with me?)

423
00:31:47,767 --> 00:31:50,033
(Meteor shower video raining down the vivid Chuncheon sky)

424
00:31:50,033 --> 00:31:52,733
I wanted to go see it with you today.

425
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:54,667
It's also good to watch it through the video

426
00:31:55,533 --> 00:31:57,833
I'm so worried and miss you.

427
00:31:58,967 --> 00:32:00,267
I love you

428
00:33:18,167 --> 00:33:20,300
Kim Chi-eun

429
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:21,067
Hello

430
00:33:21,067 --> 00:33:24,367
This is no longer admiration, but remembrance.

431
00:33:24,367 --> 00:33:26,767
Using illness as an excuse only works for a day or two

432
00:33:28,667 --> 00:33:30,433
You think of a solution.

433
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,400
Either break up

434
00:33:34,167 --> 00:33:35,667
Either confess

437
00:35:06,767 --> 00:35:07,933
guest

438
00:35:09,067 --> 00:35:10,733
Where did you pick it up?

439
00:35:12,367 --> 00:35:14,333
I asked you where you found it.

440
00:35:19,300 --> 00:35:20,900
Allow

441
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:24,267
Do you...know me?

442
00:35:26,833 --> 00:35:29,867
Excuse me, who are you?

443
00:35:32,167 --> 00:35:35,633
It's me. I'm Zhien.

444
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:36,900
What

445
00:35:40,733 --> 00:35:44,600
I don't quite understand what you mean...

446
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:45,600
I…

447
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,367
I am your girlfriend

448
00:35:52,867 --> 00:35:54,533
Kim Chi-eun

449
00:36:19,200 --> 00:36:20,667
(Jin Zhien's passport and Jin Zhien's passbook)

450
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:35,667
Nothing has changed except becoming a man

451
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:39,267
Besides becoming a man?

452
00:36:39,267 --> 00:36:40,633
Is this reasonable?

453
00:36:40,633 --> 00:36:43,833
In other words, only the appearance has changed temporarily.

454
00:36:43,833 --> 00:36:45,833
My heart is 100% Kim Ji-eun

455
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,767
This isn't a prank show, is it?

456
00:36:50,767 --> 00:36:52,100
Did Zhien apply to participate?

457
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,700
It's not like that

458
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,267
I should have told you before it happened.

459
00:36:57,267 --> 00:36:59,633
I didn't tell you because I was afraid you wouldn't believe me.

460
00:37:00,200 --> 00:37:01,667
Isn't this nonsense?

461
00:37:01,667 --> 00:37:03,867
Who would believe this?

462
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:08,300
It's normal for you to be confused now. You will be fine after you go through it.

463
00:37:08,300 --> 00:37:10,233
Think positively

464
00:37:10,700 --> 00:37:12,033
Think positively?

465
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,800
Didn't you tell me you didn't want a weird sister?

466
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:16,300
Do you want a normal brother?

467
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,033
Just treat me as your brother for now.

468
00:37:18,033 --> 00:37:20,967
When did I ever say I wanted a normal brother?

469
00:37:22,033 --> 00:37:23,167
I did say

470
00:37:23,167 --> 00:37:26,300
See, if I wasn't your girlfriend, how would I know this?

471
00:37:26,633 --> 00:37:28,267
If you have any doubts, just ask

472
00:37:28,267 --> 00:37:29,733
I can answer anything

473
00:37:30,567 --> 00:37:32,333
Our date is June 7th

474
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,467
The first flowers you bought me were tulips

475
00:37:34,467 --> 00:37:36,500
The coffee shop where we first met was Dal Segno

476
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:38,833
The place you most want to go is the Atacama Desert

477
00:37:38,833 --> 00:37:40,533
My favorite is...

478
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:43,833
Mole on your collarbone

479
00:37:48,267 --> 00:37:51,367
If you want to ask me, I can answer all the questions.

480
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:57,467
See it still doesn't work

481
00:37:57,467 --> 00:37:59,533
You should say something decent.

482
00:38:01,467 --> 00:38:04,133
No matter how I look at you, I think you are a pervert.

483
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,400
Hey, where is Zhien?

484
00:38:08,167 --> 00:38:09,633
I ask you where is your grace?

485
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:11,567
Yun Jae, calm down and listen to me.

486
00:38:11,567 --> 00:38:13,433
Don't let go of Yun Jae

487
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:15,067
I told you to let go, you little brat.

488
00:38:19,333 --> 00:38:20,433
Hello

489
00:38:20,433 --> 00:38:21,767
Enough

490
00:38:21,767 --> 00:38:24,133
Where did you get the Zhien stuff?

491
00:38:24,967 --> 00:38:26,967
Are you a stalker?

492
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:28,933
Get up and follow me to the police station

493
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:31,733
Tell the police exactly what you just said.

494
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,900
knew

495
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:38,767
I'll go to the police station myself.

496
00:38:38,767 --> 00:38:40,733
Before that, please follow me to a place

497
00:38:47,067 --> 00:38:54,733
So does the tattoo on Ji Eun's shoulder have that meaning?

498
00:38:55,467 --> 00:38:56,900
Proof of identity

499
00:38:58,033 --> 00:39:00,200
This is our grandmother's inheritance.

500
00:39:00,222 --> 00:39:02,689
Similar to high blood pressure and diabetes

501
00:39:05,467 --> 00:39:06,867
Is it hereditary?

502
00:39:11,500 --> 00:39:13,067
Um

503
00:39:13,067 --> 00:39:15,900
It’s a long story, but to put it simply

504
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:18,200
My mom is the same

505
00:39:18,200 --> 00:39:20,233
Grandma's family passed down from generation to generation

506
00:39:20,233 --> 00:39:22,067
Some will happen and some won't.

507
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:26,300
Whether it will happen or not depends on luck. He did happen.

508
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:31,800
Do you want me to believe this?

509
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:34,533
Yeah, I think it's hard to believe.

510
00:39:34,533 --> 00:39:38,067
Actually, I am too

511
00:39:38,067 --> 00:39:40,067
Important

512
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:42,400
The ending is certain

513
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:45,700
I will eventually turn back into someone like my mom.

514
00:40:03,933 --> 00:40:06,567
I need some time

515
00:40:06,567 --> 00:40:08,467
How long can be

516
00:40:08,467 --> 00:40:11,067
I can wait as long as you want.

517
00:40:16,211 --> 00:40:17,677
but

518
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:26,800
We're not going to end like this, are we?

519
00:40:42,367 --> 00:40:43,533
Allow

520
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,867
Park Yoon-jae

521
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:53,433
Can't you just trust me for once?

522
00:41:48,467 --> 00:41:51,333
"The window crack in my memory where the breeze blows"

523
00:41:51,333 --> 00:41:54,300
"Lights blooming one by one"

524
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:56,833
Is it Zhien?

525
00:41:59,733 --> 00:42:00,500
Hello

526
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:03,400
"Pick up the broken pieces again"

527
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:06,300
"Put together into a complete shape"

528
00:42:06,833 --> 00:42:10,800
"Will it be me at that moment?"

529
00:42:11,800 --> 00:42:17,567
"Wake up and make up"

530
00:42:17,567 --> 00:42:19,700
"I left it alone after it had already started"

531
00:42:19,700 --> 00:42:22,033
"I again"

532
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:26,900
"What if I mix heart mix heart so my heart"

533
00:42:26,900 --> 00:42:30,000
"I haven't woken up from my dream yet"

534
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:35,533
"Why am I hanging around you again?"

535
00:42:36,367 --> 00:42:37,267
Excuse me…

536
00:42:38,200 --> 00:42:40,867
Are you Park Yoon Jae?

537
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:43,033
Yes I am

538
00:42:43,033 --> 00:42:44,300
Who are you?

539
00:42:46,333 --> 00:42:49,067
I am Song Zhien who has an appointment to come to the social gathering today.

540
00:42:54,633 --> 00:42:56,533
Excuse me…

541
00:42:56,533 --> 00:43:00,867
Aren't you Han Yunzai, who studies finance at Yanxi University?

542
00:43:00,867 --> 00:43:03,767
No, I am Park Yun-jae from the Department of Astronomy

543
00:43:04,533 --> 00:43:06,733
Aren't you Song Zhien from the Foreign Languages Department?

544
00:43:06,733 --> 00:43:08,767
I am Kim Ji-eun from the Korean Department.

545
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,000
Excuse me…

546
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:19,800
I'm really sorry...

547
00:43:50,367 --> 00:43:51,367
Looking back

548
00:43:52,233 --> 00:43:55,233
Every moment I spent with Ji-eun since I first saw her

549
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:57,467
It's a miracle for me

550
00:43:59,167 --> 00:44:01,600
This is different from what you see with your naked eyes.

551
00:44:02,467 --> 00:44:04,100
If you look closely

552
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,967
Looks and feels very different

553
00:44:27,633 --> 00:44:28,567
Really

554
00:44:31,133 --> 00:44:32,467
Look closely like this

555
00:44:33,567 --> 00:44:34,733
It's really different.

556
00:44:37,367 --> 00:44:38,367
Feeling like...

557
00:44:39,967 --> 00:44:41,067
Looks like

558
00:44:58,967 --> 00:44:59,933
I'm really crazy

559
00:45:02,133 --> 00:45:03,400
I…

560
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,367
I don't know why I say this.

561
00:45:06,600 --> 00:45:08,000
But except for my dad

562
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,233
This is my first time kissing a boy

563
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,633
What I mean is

564
00:45:14,633 --> 00:45:15,900
I wasn't so reckless...

565
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:26,167
I also…

566
00:45:27,033 --> 00:45:29,667
I don't know why I say this.

567
00:45:29,667 --> 00:45:30,733
It's my first time too

568
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,667
Besides the stars

569
00:45:34,933 --> 00:45:37,367
This is the first time I see other beings

570
00:45:37,367 --> 00:45:39,100
My heart is beating so fast

571
00:46:34,267 --> 00:46:35,700
This is ridiculous.

572
00:46:37,300 --> 00:46:40,300
Is this also one of the miracles I experienced with Zhien?

573
00:46:57,433 --> 00:46:58,366
Hello

574
00:46:58,366 --> 00:46:59,666
Did you get home safely?

575
00:47:00,866 --> 00:47:02,199
Please ask which

576
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:03,666
My Great Grace

577
00:47:05,499 --> 00:47:07,466
Are you kidding me?

578
00:47:21,433 --> 00:47:22,866
No matter what

579
00:47:22,866 --> 00:47:24,666
Should I teach my girlfriend how to shave?

580
00:47:26,266 --> 00:47:27,233
This isn't quite right.

581
00:47:28,433 --> 00:47:30,199
If she's not careful, she might get a scar on her face.

582
00:47:32,899 --> 00:47:34,333
No matter…

583
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:35,899
Just give her the things, she should be able to figure it out on her own.

584
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:01,966
There shouldn't be a need to do that.

585
00:48:05,233 --> 00:48:07,566
I feel a little bit excited.

586
00:48:11,333 --> 00:48:12,566
Do you have any ointment?

587
00:48:12,566 --> 00:48:13,499
What

588
00:48:16,566 --> 00:48:17,933
This one?

589
00:48:17,933 --> 00:48:19,666
It just looks serious and doesn't hurt at all

590
00:48:20,399 --> 00:48:22,333
But you still need to apply medicine.

591
00:48:23,966 --> 00:48:24,999
Isn't it?

592
00:48:25,699 --> 00:48:27,633
What if there is a scar?

593
00:48:27,633 --> 00:48:29,499
Even if it leaves scars

594
00:48:29,499 --> 00:48:32,399
This is the medal you gave me for punching me in the face.

595
00:48:32,399 --> 00:48:33,666
Hello

596
00:48:33,666 --> 00:48:35,499
How can you say that?

597
00:48:36,799 --> 00:48:37,455
Isn't it?

598
00:48:37,457 --> 00:48:39,490
Why are you so mean to me?

599
00:48:41,799 --> 00:48:44,066
Hey so what should I do

600
00:48:53,966 --> 00:48:55,566
Apply on hands

601
00:48:55,566 --> 00:48:57,666
Then apply evenly on face

602
00:49:00,833 --> 00:49:02,833
A little further up, from top to bottom

603
00:49:04,733 --> 00:49:05,833
Very good

604
00:49:05,833 --> 00:49:07,166
This is so fun

605
00:49:08,433 --> 00:49:09,699
Don't you think I look like Santa Claus?

606
00:49:10,966 --> 00:49:12,333
Look in the mirror

607
00:49:15,299 --> 00:49:16,566
There's a razor next to it.

608
00:49:17,433 --> 00:49:18,433
have

609
00:49:21,299 --> 00:49:22,133
Dry

610
00:49:23,999 --> 00:49:24,866
for you

611
00:49:27,433 --> 00:49:28,633
Put the part with shaving foam

612
00:49:28,633 --> 00:49:30,733
Gently scrape from top to bottom

613
00:49:30,733 --> 00:49:31,966
From top to bottom?

614
00:49:31,966 --> 00:49:32,833
Lighten up

615
00:49:34,899 --> 00:49:36,399
A little lighter

616
00:49:36,399 --> 00:49:37,666
Scrape down

617
00:49:38,466 --> 00:49:39,333
Scrape gently

618
00:49:41,366 --> 00:49:43,733
I told you to be gentler.

619
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:44,833
Let me see

620
00:49:45,999 --> 00:49:47,133
Bleeding

621
00:49:50,733 --> 00:49:53,933
The most important thing when shaving is the angle

622
00:49:54,599 --> 00:49:55,899
I'll show you once.

623
00:49:56,766 --> 00:49:58,766
Don't talk, don't move.

624
00:49:59,766 --> 00:50:00,966
Good to know

625
00:50:00,966 --> 00:50:02,399
I told you not to talk.

626
00:50:08,866 --> 00:50:10,266
From the diagonal

627
00:50:10,266 --> 00:50:12,433
Scrape slowly from top to bottom

628
00:50:14,233 --> 00:50:15,499
Angles are important

629
00:50:16,033 --> 00:50:17,433
From top to bottom

630
00:50:18,399 --> 00:50:19,599
The same is true next to it

631
00:50:48,766 --> 00:50:49,699
You put your head

632
00:50:50,399 --> 00:50:51,766
Can you turn over there?

633
00:50:54,633 --> 00:50:55,466
Is that so?

634
00:50:56,333 --> 00:50:57,099
right

635
00:51:29,799 --> 00:51:30,733
I'll do it

636
00:51:35,533 --> 00:51:36,899
Good for you

637
00:51:43,666 --> 00:51:44,933
Is this the case?

638
00:51:44,933 --> 00:51:47,166
No, the angle is a bit wrong.

639
00:51:48,499 --> 00:51:49,733
Is this the case?

640
00:51:50,299 --> 00:51:51,399
good

641
00:51:53,033 --> 00:51:54,633
This kid looks like this...

642
00:51:56,233 --> 00:51:58,433
How come you are so handsome?

643
00:52:23,066 --> 00:52:24,566
that

644
00:52:24,566 --> 00:52:27,333
I've done what I need to do, so I'll leave now.

645
00:52:29,699 --> 00:52:31,499
Are you leaving so soon?

646
00:52:31,499 --> 00:52:33,766
You've only been here for thirty minutes.

647
00:52:35,466 --> 00:52:37,333
Dinner time is almost here. I have to go.

648
00:52:37,333 --> 00:52:38,233
Still have to go to work

649
00:52:38,233 --> 00:52:40,399
Don't you start working at 5 o'clock at night?

650
00:52:40,399 --> 00:52:41,933
It's only 3 o'clock now

651
00:52:43,799 --> 00:52:45,766
Your sister will be off work soon.

652
00:52:45,766 --> 00:52:48,433
My sister went to Busan on a business trip.

653
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:52,333
Right

654
00:52:52,333 --> 00:52:55,566
People who usually move like furniture are going on a business trip at this time.

655
00:52:58,066 --> 00:53:00,299
Can't you just have a bowl of instant noodles before leaving?

656
00:53:07,099 --> 00:53:08,899
Eat before leaving

657
00:53:12,133 --> 00:53:13,866
Eat before leaving

658
00:53:15,833 --> 00:53:18,033
Don't you want to stay with me?

659
00:53:19,533 --> 00:53:20,633
Please

660
00:53:21,399 --> 00:53:22,933
Please

661
00:53:23,599 --> 00:53:25,266
No... please

662
00:53:25,266 --> 00:53:27,133
I... please

663
00:53:33,899 --> 00:53:37,166
I have to go today.

664
00:54:31,766 --> 00:54:33,166
Oh my god

665
00:54:33,166 --> 00:54:36,133
Your dark circles have become more severe

666
00:54:36,133 --> 00:54:37,399
What happened

667
00:54:38,299 --> 00:54:39,899
Hello Lee Min Hyuk

668
00:54:39,899 --> 00:54:42,033
If your girlfriend

669
00:54:42,033 --> 00:54:44,599
What would you do if you suddenly became a boy?

670
00:54:44,599 --> 00:54:46,499
Why didn't you even give a notice?

671
00:54:46,499 --> 00:54:47,733
Such a terrible assumption

672
00:54:47,733 --> 00:54:49,766
Even more handsome than you

673
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:51,633
He is tall and strong.

674
00:54:52,833 --> 00:54:54,533
This is a two-choice game

675
00:54:54,533 --> 00:54:57,933
Is he like his girlfriend's boyfriend or like his boyfriend's girlfriend?

676
00:54:57,933 --> 00:54:59,399
Yes, it's a two-choice game

677
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:00,499
Which one would you choose?

678
00:55:01,233 --> 00:55:03,366
Of course the second one

679
00:55:03,366 --> 00:55:05,166
Is this even a question?

680
00:55:13,233 --> 00:55:15,266
Then I'll go first

681
00:55:15,266 --> 00:55:16,566
good

682
00:55:17,266 --> 00:55:19,499
That's right, brother

683
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:23,466
I thought about it carefully.

684
00:55:23,466 --> 00:55:25,799
If my girlfriend suddenly becomes a boy one day

685
00:55:25,799 --> 00:55:28,266
I will definitely ask him this question

686
00:55:28,266 --> 00:55:29,599
What is the problem?

687
00:55:29,599 --> 00:55:32,066
Is there any opportunity?

688
00:55:32,666 --> 00:55:33,433
An opportunity?

689
00:55:33,433 --> 00:55:34,766
Isn't that how fairy tales are written?

690
00:55:34,766 --> 00:55:37,999
Breaking promises, being jealous of others, or being overly curious

691
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:40,533
There must be some kind of opportunity for this kind of magic.

692
00:55:40,533 --> 00:55:41,733
As long as you know what the opportunity is

693
00:55:41,733 --> 00:55:44,066
It's just a matter of time before the magic is lifted.

694
00:55:46,633 --> 00:55:48,733
An opportunity to become a boy?

695
00:55:49,566 --> 00:55:52,566
I don't know. It seems nothing special.

696
00:55:54,833 --> 00:55:56,466
That's right

697
00:55:56,466 --> 00:55:57,499
Double yolk

698
00:55:57,499 --> 00:55:58,799
Double yolk?

699
00:56:01,066 --> 00:56:02,099
Oh my god

700
00:56:02,099 --> 00:56:05,999
This is the first time I have seen double yolks in my life.

701
00:56:09,433 --> 00:56:11,199
Double yolk?

702
00:56:11,199 --> 00:56:14,633
If all else fails, there is only one way left.

703
00:56:14,633 --> 00:56:16,866
Just do it first and then talk about it

704
00:56:16,866 --> 00:56:18,499
What to do directly

705
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:23,266
Kiss

706
00:56:25,266 --> 00:56:26,866
Regardless of ancient and modern times, China and foreign

707
00:56:26,866 --> 00:56:29,933
Isn't the cheat for forbidden love just kissing?

708
00:56:30,999 --> 00:56:32,966
That sounds like the answer you would say.

709
00:56:33,766 --> 00:56:36,199
Fuck you.

710
00:56:36,199 --> 00:56:37,666
If you encounter such an inexplicable situation

711
00:56:37,666 --> 00:56:39,266
Isn't it better to break up?

712
00:56:39,266 --> 00:56:41,566
Aren't you worried about this because you can't break up?

713
00:56:41,566 --> 00:56:43,533
Well, at least give it a try.

714
00:56:50,533 --> 00:56:52,066
Soft candy?

715
00:56:53,233 --> 00:56:56,199
I was very cautious when I was a kid.

716
00:56:56,199 --> 00:56:58,833
My mom gave me candy.

717
00:56:58,833 --> 00:57:03,166
When I feel uneasy, I eat some candy and it makes me feel better.

718
00:57:03,766 --> 00:57:06,233
I don't know if I feel comforted.

719
00:57:06,233 --> 00:57:08,399
It really makes you feel much better.

720
00:57:09,333 --> 00:57:10,699
You have me now

721
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:12,766
I don't think I need fudge anymore.

722
00:57:14,833 --> 00:57:16,899
gentlemen

723
00:57:16,899 --> 00:57:18,599
Did you know…

724
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:21,333
Like someone

725
00:57:21,333 --> 00:57:24,066
Does it also require courage?

726
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:27,033
I ate so many gummies when I was dating you

727
00:57:30,799 --> 00:57:34,033
If I don't want you to wear dentures in the future and want to tie you down with a ring

728
00:57:34,033 --> 00:57:36,199
Then I have to be better to you.

729
00:57:39,966 --> 00:57:42,033
That's enough for now.

730
00:57:42,033 --> 00:57:45,033
Just stay by my side like you are now

731
00:57:45,033 --> 00:57:46,799
That's enough for me.

732
00:58:04,999 --> 00:58:06,166
Who is it?

733
00:58:06,933 --> 00:58:08,066
It's me

734
00:58:08,666 --> 00:58:10,233
Allow

735
00:58:10,233 --> 00:58:11,599
Is it allowed?

736
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:22,533
What's going on?

737
00:58:22,533 --> 00:58:24,533
What's the matter with you coming to see me so late?

738
00:58:26,299 --> 00:58:28,933
I have something I must do now.

739
00:58:30,499 --> 00:58:34,099
What happened?

740
00:58:37,933 --> 00:58:40,166
Let's try it

741
00:58:40,166 --> 00:58:41,666
Hack Bar

742
00:59:13,567 --> 00:59:16,134
(Postscript)

743
00:59:23,367 --> 00:59:26,267
I need some time

744
00:59:26,267 --> 00:59:28,067
It takes as long as you want.

745
00:59:28,067 --> 00:59:30,334
It doesn't matter how long it takes you.

746
00:59:31,134 --> 00:59:34,201
But we should...

747
00:59:35,067 --> 00:59:37,401
It won't end like this.

748
00:59:49,834 --> 00:59:51,067
Allow

749
00:59:54,701 --> 00:59:56,234
Park Yoon-jae

750
00:59:58,134 --> 01:00:00,967
Can't you trust me for once?

751
01:00:02,834 --> 01:00:04,734
Unbelievable

752
01:00:04,734 --> 01:00:08,134
No, I don't want to believe it.

753
01:00:08,667 --> 01:00:10,534
It's true

754
01:00:12,301 --> 01:00:15,167
I can't live without you

755
01:00:15,167 --> 01:00:17,667
But at this moment I understood

756
01:00:19,634 --> 01:00:22,067
The boy in front of me

757
01:00:22,067 --> 01:00:26,434
It's really my girlfriend Kim Ji-eun

758
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:15,801
(My girlfriend is more handsome than me)

759
01:01:15,801 --> 01:01:18,901
I'm afraid Yun Jae will break up with me

760
01:01:18,901 --> 01:01:22,867
Honestly, it's hard to maintain the previous relationship.

761
01:01:22,867 --> 01:01:24,967
Big eyes and white skin

762
01:01:24,967 --> 01:01:26,434
Introduce me to

763
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:27,234
Yuli

764
01:01:27,234 --> 01:01:29,801
What happened to that perfect man?

765
01:01:29,801 --> 01:01:32,234
I am Ji Eun, okay? Kim Ji Eun

766
01:01:32,234 --> 01:01:33,034
Watch it

767
01:01:33,034 --> 01:01:35,701
Let me teach you a trick

768
01:01:35,701 --> 01:01:38,301
Hello, my name is Lee Min Hyuk

769
01:01:38,301 --> 01:01:40,367
What, where is he?

770
01:01:40,367 --> 01:01:42,634
Where is your kindness, kid?
