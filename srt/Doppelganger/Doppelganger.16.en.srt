1
00:01:00,040 --> 00:01:01,040
Where are they

2
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:07,519
Are you afraid that the guilty women will live

3
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:09,479
Cloud surge reappears

4
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,720
Involved in the case of the former prince

5
00:01:12,519 --> 00:01:13,760
Gibberish

6
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,480
Xiangfu

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,519
The same queen and the three princes are all glorious

8
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:22,079
Lose everything

9
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,959
You should be afraid too

10
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:48,079
don't say

11
00:01:48,879 --> 00:01:51,879
Just waiting for the blood to dry and die drop by drop

12
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,519
His Majesty Shen Que summoned

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,400
A great general

14
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,480
For some guilty girls

15
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,879
Is it worth losing your life

16
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,560
Because they're weak

17
00:02:13,079 --> 00:02:14,079
I'm a knife-wielder

18
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,879
Is my life worth more

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,720
They have to die

20
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,680
The surge of clouds does not completely disappear

21
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,560
Rivers and mountains are unstable

22
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:27,159
Sacrifice is inevitable for the overall situation

23
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,439
Your Majesty

24
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,319
Is he afraid that the grievances of the first prince will be washed away

25
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,759
The courtiers will support the imperial grandson

26
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,240
The Third Prince can't successfully inherit the rule

27
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,240
Presumptuous

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,879
You're a smart man

29
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,840
But you're too young

30
00:02:46,359 --> 00:02:48,960
I don't understand people's life

31
00:02:49,919 --> 00:02:52,439
Whether it's an ordinary man or a prince

32
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,520
Only two words at the end

33
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,080
however

34
00:02:58,599 --> 00:02:59,720
How are others

35
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,120
Nothing to do with me

36
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:02,319
All I know is

37
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,359
There are too many ghosts in this world

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:08,039
In a glossy skin

39
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:08,960
Do dirty things

40
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:09,879
But you won't

41
00:03:10,520 --> 00:03:12,879
You used to be a magnanimous boy under my bright universe

42
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:15,319
If even you are beyond recognition

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,080
What else can I believe

44
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:18,759
I don't want to

45
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:22,120
You can't be that kind of person

46
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,120
I've seen a lot

47
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:27,359
A man who thinks he can change the world

48
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,960
In the end, it's not a bow

49
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,080
It is a drop of blood that becomes the tip of my knife

50
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,199
In the turbid currents of their abhorrence

51
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,879
What's their name again

52
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:43,720
I have long forgotten

53
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:46,960
Your Majesty

54
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,840
Their names

55
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,960
Call your people

56
00:04:00,199 --> 00:04:01,879
Your Majesty, Your

57
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,280
Why can someone drag Shen Que down

58
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,439
Your Majesty

59
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,759
Zimin

60
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,159
Zimin

61
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,359
Zimin

62
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:32,440
Zimin

63
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,359
Your Majesty

64
00:04:40,919 --> 00:04:41,760
Bachelor Cui

65
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:44,080
My master wants to see you

66
00:04:45,359 --> 00:04:46,400
Who is your master

67
00:04:46,840 --> 00:04:47,840
Princess Changning

68
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,039
Busy business

69
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:52,200
Have no time to get out

70
00:04:52,679 --> 00:04:54,119
The princess has five fish

71
00:04:54,599 --> 00:04:56,159
Five fish that can eat nightmares

72
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,320
Maybe it's what the bachelor is looking for

73
00:04:58,520 --> 00:04:59,679
Five fish

74
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,400
Where is your princess

75
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,999
Right in your room

76
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:08,799
My room

77
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,679
The princess is the goddess of fire

78
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:12,359
I'm interested in your stay here

79
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,960
You should be happy

80
00:05:14,239 --> 00:05:15,440
Your Majesty has approved

81
00:05:27,559 --> 00:05:28,479
Princess Changning

82
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:30,039
Bachelor Cui please stay

83
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,440
Please hear me tell a story first

84
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,080
All ears

85
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:37,679
A fish farmer acquired a fish by chance

86
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:39,440
That fish is ordinary

87
00:05:39,999 --> 00:05:41,919
But because he swallowed a night pearl

88
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,320
It can glow in the night

89
00:05:43,799 --> 00:05:44,479
The man began

90
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:46,679
Just have the same nightmare every night

91
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,919
That dream was terrible

92
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:51,039
As time passes

93
00:05:51,799 --> 00:05:54,359
He hated dreams more than fish

94
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:56,559
And then what

95
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:59,679
Then he found a way not to have nightmares

96
00:06:00,559 --> 00:06:01,760
Gained relief

97
00:06:02,359 --> 00:06:03,280
What's the way

98
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,320
What is it

99
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,359
Please listen to the next breakdown

100
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,200
Interesting

101
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,119
Is this fish farmer me or His Majesty

102
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:17,599
Maybe both

103
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:19,799
It's just Bachelor Cui

104
00:06:20,599 --> 00:06:24,720
How do you know there is a night pearl in this fish's belly

105
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:27,440
Doesn't matter if you have it or not

106
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:31,119
What matters is that nightmares start from it

107
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,280
It can only be destroyed, isn't it

108
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,320
Yeah

109
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:40,640
I was lucky enough to acquire five fish

110
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,119
It is said that there is a fish with a night pearl in its belly

111
00:06:45,159 --> 00:06:47,400
I don't want to repeat the mistakes of fish farmers

112
00:06:47,999 --> 00:06:49,679
I wanted to give it to Bachelor Cui

113
00:06:51,559 --> 00:06:52,599
Princess Wise

114
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:55,159
Just don't want the fish

115
00:06:55,799 --> 00:06:57,320
I don't want the night pearl either

116
00:06:58,799 --> 00:06:59,720
So what do you want

117
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,320
stop

118
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,679
What do you want

119
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,119
I'll tell you later

120
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,760
Take a look at these five fish

121
00:07:07,520 --> 00:07:08,960
Is there anything you're looking for

122
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,119
Where

123
00:07:10,520 --> 00:07:11,679
Fish in front of you

124
00:07:12,159 --> 00:07:13,080
You open it and see

125
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,359
You dare to play with me

126
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:41,919
Where is the guilty woman

127
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,080
You're not giving me what I want

128
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,479
Why should I give you what you want

129
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:49,440
What do you want

130
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:51,640
Lotus Pond Fish Cake

131
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:53,479
what

132
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:55,640
You put these fish in front of you

133
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,280
Make me lotus pond fish cakes

134
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,159
Then please me

135
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,840
Please me and kneel to me

136
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,960
I will tell you the whereabouts of the guilty girl

137
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:07,880
Who the hell are you

138
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:11,400
Jiang Jiaojiao is obviously dead

139
00:08:12,559 --> 00:08:15,720
I'm a storyteller

140
00:08:16,239 --> 00:08:17,479
The cold room is simple

141
00:08:17,999 --> 00:08:19,760
If the princess likes it, she will live

142
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:22,999
It's just that this joke can't be played casually

143
00:08:28,679 --> 00:08:30,760
Even if I can't kill your body

144
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,760
I can destroy your spirit, too

145
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,559
Jiang Song is the best knife

146
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:37,799
How can I let you find it easily

147
00:08:50,239 --> 00:08:52,840
The Zhenren said to make you the princess

148
00:08:52,840 --> 00:08:54,080
You can bless me Corning

149
00:08:55,119 --> 00:08:55,999
These days

150
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,840
I really calmed my nerves a lot

151
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:01,920
What I want to tell Your Majesty today is

152
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,680
The story of Mulian saving his mother

153
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,639
The mother of Buddha's disciple Mulian

154
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:08,599
Fall into the realm of hungry ghosts and suffer

155
00:09:09,479 --> 00:09:11,680
So he was at the obon party

156
00:09:12,119 --> 00:09:15,359
With the strength of monks from ten directions, his mother can have enough food

157
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,040
But not all children

158
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,239
As filial and righteous as Mulian

159
00:09:23,359 --> 00:09:24,519
Help me

160
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,639
What are you trying to say

161
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,279
First Prince Xiaobi Mulian

162
00:10:00,239 --> 00:10:01,720
And the third prince

163
00:10:02,639 --> 00:10:03,759
An unfilial person

164
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,920
How do you govern the world, Your Majesty

165
00:10:15,239 --> 00:10:15,840
cousin

166
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,560
What is it

167
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,800
That Shen did confess the whereabouts of the guilty girl

168
00:10:20,479 --> 00:10:22,759
Father gave him permission to capture them back and perform meritorious deeds

169
00:10:23,599 --> 00:10:24,999
Shen Qe spoke

170
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,519
The blood was released for three days and three nights

171
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,119
I guess I can't stand it

172
00:10:28,479 --> 00:10:29,160
I'm afraid of death

173
00:10:30,119 --> 00:10:31,320
Just wait and see

174
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:32,560
But now the question is

175
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:35,119
Father asked him to catch him alive this time

176
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:36,560
Could it be that

177
00:10:37,119 --> 00:10:38,359
He wants to retrieve the Cloud Chung Order

178
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,040
Help the first prince reverse the case

179
00:10:41,560 --> 00:10:42,479
In this way

180
00:10:43,080 --> 00:10:45,440
Wouldn't that boy Zhao Chengze be the crown prince

181
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:47,920
Shen did say where the guilty woman was

182
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:02,560
Lord

183
00:11:04,759 --> 00:11:05,560
Not found

184
00:11:08,440 --> 00:11:09,840
There's movement there. Go over there

185
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:10,759
Chase quickly

186
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:14,720
Bachelor Cui

187
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:16,560
Found your letter

188
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:24,759
Choi You'an, long time no see

189
00:11:24,759 --> 00:11:26,960
Sure enough it's you Jiang Jiaojiao

190
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:30,239
The story goes on one day

191
00:11:30,639 --> 00:11:32,279
Fish farmers no longer have nightmares

192
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:33,960
Gained relief

193
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,080
Because she put the fish

194
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,720
Killed

195
00:11:37,720 --> 00:11:38,320
She

196
00:11:41,119 --> 00:11:42,639
The fish farmer is a woman

197
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:47,359
The fish farmer is not Your Majesty

198
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:48,720
It's not me

199
00:11:51,759 --> 00:11:53,040
It's Jiang Jiaojiao

200
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,560
Such a simple story

201
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:57,800
You just figured it out

202
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:00,119
By the way, the fish you're looking for is in the room

203
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,320
If you come alone, you may not have time to save her

204
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:06,080
Jiang Jiaojiao

205
00:12:52,879 --> 00:12:53,840
Cicada Niang

206
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,440
Madam, spare your life

207
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,999
I won't tell you

208
00:13:36,479 --> 00:13:38,399
You-an, he won't know

209
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,960
Madam, please spare your life

210
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,279
Madam Madam

211
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:44,639
Cicada Niang, you must die

212
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:48,279
You can't let others know that you'an him

213
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:50,720
Choi You-an

214
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:02,399
Jiang Jiaojiao

215
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,239
What you said

216
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:07,440
Nightmares arise only because of fish

217
00:14:08,359 --> 00:14:10,200
It can only be destroyed by fish

218
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:13,720
Jiang Niangzi

219
00:14:15,239 --> 00:14:16,479
Only by killing her

220
00:14:17,479 --> 00:14:18,879
So that I can completely get out

221
00:14:18,879 --> 00:14:20,080
The nightmare you brought me

222
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:21,560
don't

223
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:22,599
don't

224
00:14:24,359 --> 00:14:25,440
You begged me

225
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,519
I beg you what do you want

226
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,639
I can give it to you

227
00:14:29,599 --> 00:14:30,599
Late

228
00:14:31,960 --> 00:14:33,759
It's your turn to have nightmares

229
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:40,479
don't

230
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,800
Jiang Niangzi

231
00:15:05,759 --> 00:15:06,479
Jiang Niangzi

232
00:15:07,119 --> 00:15:07,879
Jiang Niangzi

233
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,519
Jiang Niangzi

234
00:15:12,759 --> 00:15:13,720
Cui Yongzi

235
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,399
I would never let anything happen to you

236
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,920
I'll take you to the doctor now

237
00:15:22,119 --> 00:15:24,879
Why don't you just let me go

238
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:27,200
Because you are the only one who can save me

239
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:29,399
You are high above you

240
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,279
How can I save you

241
00:15:34,119 --> 00:15:34,680
NO

242
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:35,759
Not

243
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:37,639
I'm not on high

244
00:15:38,239 --> 00:15:38,800
I am

245
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,759
You can't let others know about you

246
00:15:44,999 --> 00:15:46,320
You'an is

247
00:15:47,399 --> 00:15:48,239
I'm not

248
00:15:48,920 --> 00:15:49,840
What are you

249
00:15:51,399 --> 00:15:55,519
You'an is a bastard you born

250
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,920
I was born to a cicada mother

251
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:02,720
I'm a bastard

252
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:04,680
My foster mother

253
00:16:05,399 --> 00:16:07,479
Killed my real mother

254
00:16:15,359 --> 00:16:16,639
It's not your fault

255
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,279
Really

256
00:16:20,399 --> 00:16:21,519
False

257
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:27,359
So this is the secret of your heart

258
00:16:29,119 --> 00:16:31,320
You divide people into three, six and nine

259
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:33,279
Actually, I am the least classy

260
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:35,639
ridiculous

261
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,720
Choi You-an, listen to me

262
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:43,399
You wouldn't be the leading man if it weren't for me

263
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:45,239
Because I chose you

264
00:16:45,239 --> 00:16:46,399
You're the leading man

265
00:16:47,359 --> 00:16:50,279
Actually, you're nothing

266
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:08,879
Doing this can really force Choi You-an to die

267
00:17:11,239 --> 00:17:12,160
We can only gamble

268
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:14,200
Even if I don't die this time

269
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:17,640
I also have a way to make him fall from a high position

270
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,440
How to do it

271
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:22,120
The Third Prince is as stupid as a pig

272
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,999
He's just a stepping stone

273
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:26,600
The ending of the story

274
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:29,559
Cui You'an will become emperor

275
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,440
But

276
00:17:31,999 --> 00:17:33,759
If there is no third prince

277
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:34,960
What will happen

278
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,079
Can you move the third prince

279
00:17:38,519 --> 00:17:39,920
I have my own way

280
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,960
But why don't even you know

281
00:17:44,239 --> 00:17:46,400
Cicada Niang is Choi You-an's biological mother

282
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:48,239
I'm really not impressed by this

283
00:17:48,239 --> 00:17:50,400
I didn't care about Cicada Niang at first

284
00:17:50,680 --> 00:17:51,999
But I was in the prime minister's house

285
00:17:54,079 --> 00:17:56,120
See that he has been drawing pictures of Mulian saving his mother

286
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:58,640
The servant has also been concerned about the cause of Cicada Niang's death

287
00:17:58,640 --> 00:17:59,479
Cover up

288
00:18:00,120 --> 00:18:01,360
I suspect there's something else

289
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:04,759
So I tied up Sister Kim

290
00:18:05,759 --> 00:18:09,079
He said that Cui You'an was born to the Prime Minister and the cicada mother

291
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:11,279
But he was adopted by his mistress since childhood

292
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,559
Seeing the feelings between Cui You'an and Chan Niang

293
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:15,479
Getting better and better

294
00:18:15,759 --> 00:18:18,160
Plus rumors about his life experience

295
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,920
The mistress killed the cicada mother

296
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,479
It happened that this scene was caught by Choi You-an
