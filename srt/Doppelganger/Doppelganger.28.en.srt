1
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,119
Is it finally over

2
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,320
prepare

3
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,279
Good

4
00:01:41,199 --> 00:01:42,240
Jiang Song

5
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:44,440
Hold on to me

6
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:58,520
To live

7
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:02,320
Live for yourself

8
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:08,960
Hold on to me

9
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:12,760
Jiang Jiaojiao

10
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:14,719
Jiang Jiaojiao

11
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:19,479
Don't give up

12
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,079
Wake up

13
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:50,600
Quick

14
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:51,199
great

15
00:02:51,199 --> 00:02:52,919
Immediately inform the people of all departments to come for consultation

16
00:02:52,919 --> 00:02:53,560
Good

17
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,799
Let me tell you something

18
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,760
My story

19
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,120
Mom always said she had no preference

20
00:03:11,679 --> 00:03:12,679
But she doesn't know

21
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,720
Sometimes children see better than adults

22
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:18,440
She cooked for her younger brother in different ways

23
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:21,639
But decide that I'm a picky eater for not eating carrots

24
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:25,359
But mom, I'm not a picky eater

25
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:28,079
I just don't eat carrots

26
00:03:29,199 --> 00:03:32,560
As for Dad, he just wants me to obey

27
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:36,799
All I need is to adhere to him unconditionally

28
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,000
I think it's pretty good too

29
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,399
I'm chasing it every day

30
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,040
I also feel very handsome

31
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,040
Same as

32
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,280
Let's talk over there

33
00:03:47,479 --> 00:03:48,760
No one can see me

34
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,720
Suffocating, no need for physical violence

35
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,040
Just a look

36
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:59,720
A few gossip is enough

37
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,639
I am like a non-player character

38
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:05,199
The meaning of being

39
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:07,760
They are all passers-by as the protagonist

40
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,160
Speaking of my life

41
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,840
Haven't experienced great suffering

42
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:18,560
But my pain isn't worth mentioning

43
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,480
Because I am ordinary, withdrawn and sensitive

44
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:28,320
Is my voice not worth listening to

45
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,639
Is it because I'm not good enough

46
00:04:32,599 --> 00:04:36,279
But this is what I am. This is who I am

47
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,519
I really want to live another life

48
00:04:42,719 --> 00:04:44,839
I really want to be a heroine once

49
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:48,680
I really want to be seen

50
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:52,560
So I put my feelings

51
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,240
Catharsis into a novel I write

52
00:04:55,320 --> 00:04:57,760
I hope my hero can bring me happiness

53
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,719
After jumping off a cliff

54
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,320
I thought I had crossed into the world I yearned for

55
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,519
Unexpectedly

56
00:05:06,079 --> 00:05:08,560
It's just a huge cage that someone else built for me

57
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:12,959
In the world of fiction

58
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:15,639
I can strut

59
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,240
But in the real world

60
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:22,000
I dare not

61
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,399
Why can you be so brave

62
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,480
Because I love myself

63
00:05:34,199 --> 00:05:35,399
I know myself

64
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,279
I know what I want

65
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,079
Like what

66
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:40,880
I am fearless

67
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,519
So I'm brave

68
00:05:45,719 --> 00:05:46,480
That's nice

69
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:49,279
from childhood

70
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:53,680
All I care about is getting approval

71
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,839
Follow and Like

72
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:59,639
I never thought about what I wanted

73
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:02,440
Why would you look through someone else's eyes

74
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:03,639
To see yourself

75
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,560
Can those people's gazes make up the real you

76
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,719
You're your own audience

77
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,560
Even more his own protagonist

78
00:06:20,399 --> 00:06:21,240
Yeah

79
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:24,079
They should have finished it in my script

80
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,800
Thank you Jiang Song

81
00:06:46,159 --> 00:06:47,519
Come with me to the real world

82
00:06:51,279 --> 00:06:53,039
What about the real world

83
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:54,839
There is no perfect world

84
00:06:55,639 --> 00:06:56,760
As long as I believe

85
00:06:57,719 --> 00:06:58,959
Everywhere is real

86
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,079
You're right

87
00:07:04,279 --> 00:07:05,800
Believing is true

88
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,000
go

89
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,480
The road ahead is still stormy

90
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,480
But this time the person I'm gonna be will catch me

91
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:47,360
goodbye

92
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:49,920
treasure

93
00:08:06,159 --> 00:08:06,959
Excuse me

94
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,719
Qianqian

95
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:16,719
a form of address for one's wife

96
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,800
You know me

97
00:08:24,719 --> 00:08:28,079
Excuse me, what is the year number now

98
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,279
Now it is the fifth year of Chengping

99
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:33,079
It's been five years

100
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,399
The world doesn't end

101
00:08:38,199 --> 00:08:39,120
Adie

102
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,279
That's nice

103
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:48,840
I also want to travel alone

104
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,720
But now I just finished the Jinshi exam

105
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,279
I can't leave Beijing for the time being

106
00:08:54,039 --> 00:08:55,960
It's good to stay in the capital

107
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:58,720
a form of address for one's wife

108
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:00,559
Excuse me

109
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,159
Do you know General Shen Que

110
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:07,559
General Shen, who doesn't know

111
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:12,679
Excuse me

112
00:09:14,159 --> 00:09:17,159
Is he all right?

113
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,840
well

114
00:09:19,439 --> 00:09:21,200
Is the wife an old friend of General Shen

115
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:54,639
One day you'll get out of your own world

116
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,960
Heavy rain and frost outside

117
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:58,880
Narrow road is difficult

118
00:10:00,039 --> 00:10:01,120
Bad eyes

119
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,840
But remember

120
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,799
Nothing worth bowing down

121
00:10:07,799 --> 00:10:08,559
no

122
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:12,399
Don't be afraid, don't be anxious

123
00:10:13,159 --> 00:10:15,600
Go if you want to leave, stop if you want

124
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:19,720
Because the best view is actually

125
00:10:21,159 --> 00:10:22,319
Your eyes

126
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,679
Shen Que

127
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,960
Jiang Song

128
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,000
Jiang Song

129
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:17,559
Jiang Song

130
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,760
She disappears

131
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:56,439
I couldn't find her this time

132
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:59,279
Only when you hold this book

133
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,240
I just felt the slightest connection with her

134
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:08,399
I keep it on my chest day and night

135
00:12:09,679 --> 00:12:11,120
As long as I'm alive

136
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,240
I hope she's somewhere in the world

137
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,720
Can hear my heart beat

138
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:19,919
Find the way back
