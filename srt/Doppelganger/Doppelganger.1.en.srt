1
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:29,799
The woman does not give and receive a close

2
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:31,560
This is incompatible with courtesy

3
00:00:32,479 --> 00:00:34,119
It is indeed incompatible with courtesy

4
00:00:40,439 --> 00:00:41,400
Drugging for pleasure

5
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:42,439
Self-recommended pillow mat

6
00:00:42,519 --> 00:00:43,919
Sister, do you still have any shame

7
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:45,839
Enough, Yaozu

8
00:00:46,519 --> 00:00:47,640
Didn't your sister also want to

9
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:49,159
Is our Jiang family planning

10
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:50,720
She is vain and snob

11
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,600
Look down on Zhang San, who was promised before

12
00:00:52,839 --> 00:00:54,439
I went to climb the branch of the prime minister's mansion by myself

13
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:56,119
Although our Jiang family has fallen

14
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,439
But we can't follow the trend

15
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,600
Sell yourself for glory

16
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:03,799
Dare to ask my wife's boudoir name

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:06,519
My husband has always been noble

18
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,559
Willing to be responsible for my wife's reputation

19
00:01:08,919 --> 00:01:11,119
Come to the door to propose marriage in a few days

20
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:12,520
My name is Jiang Song

21
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:20,440
Jiang Song

22
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,960
This one is our place

23
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,559
Embroidered overnight by the best embroiders

24
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,880
This brocade is gorgeous in color

25
00:01:29,999 --> 00:01:31,719
Like the clouds in the sky

26
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,320
Look at this moire pattern, this line

27
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,919
Bachelor Cui specifically explained it

28
00:01:37,279 --> 00:01:40,999
Whoever is his bride must be the best of everything

29
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,240
Is it the most expensive

30
00:01:43,639 --> 00:01:44,919
That's natural

31
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:47,520
That's enough

32
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,279
Yaozu, don't be angry

33
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,520
The three pictures are infatuated with her

34
00:01:56,639 --> 00:01:57,800
But she climbed to Bachelor Cui

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,999
Does she deserve it

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,839
You men can be choosy in marrying wives

37
00:02:03,559 --> 00:02:05,639
Why can't I pick a good husband

38
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:07,320
Earn a good family

39
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,240
If Father Izumi knows

40
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:11,279
The Jiang family fell after his father's death

41
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,880
If it wasn't for me in charge of the property

42
00:02:14,199 --> 00:02:15,600
Can you concentrate on your studies

43
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:17,320
I am not willing to be humble

44
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,199
Climb up

45
00:02:19,359 --> 00:02:20,320
Is there a mistake

46
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:22,120
It is my responsibility to shine on the lintel

47
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,600
I will be upright

48
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:24,720
Not like you

49
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,919
If I can be admitted to the official

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,679
Why climb the door with your body

51
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,760
Don't you men rely on others to climb up

52
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,399
Depend on dad

53
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,799
There are many people who rely on women

54
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,359
Stop accusing me and take care of yourself

55
00:02:43,359 --> 00:02:44,040
You

56
00:02:47,079 --> 00:02:48,639
Yaozu, where are you going

57
00:02:48,639 --> 00:02:49,440
Mrs. Yiu Cho

58
00:02:49,959 --> 00:02:50,880
Yaozu

59
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:52,959
a form of address for one's wife

60
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,320
Don't listen to Alang

61
00:02:54,679 --> 00:02:56,239
Your good days are still ahead

62
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,519
I'm gonna call my lady back

63
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:25,919
The water is running out

64
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,600
Come on, leave the water

65
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,040
The water is running out, come on, come on

66
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,359
Jiaojiao is still in there

67
00:03:30,359 --> 00:03:32,199
Ma'am, my daughter's in there

68
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:33,519
Niang Jiaojiao

69
00:03:33,919 --> 00:03:34,919
Jiaojiao

70
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,959
Please go and save my Jiaojiao

71
00:03:38,359 --> 00:03:40,000
Please save my daughter

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,239
This is the retribution for drugging the young master of the Prime Minister

73
00:03:42,399 --> 00:03:45,079
The heart is higher than the sky and the fate is thinner than paper

74
00:03:45,399 --> 00:03:46,000
Yaozu

75
00:03:46,399 --> 00:03:47,639
Granny, please

76
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,760
To save your sister

77
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:49,720
Mother

78
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,919
No one can save the fire so big

79
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,280
Jiaojiao

80
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,199
Jiaojiao

81
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,480
Jiaojiao

82
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:26,920
Jiaojiao

83
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:28,839
Jiaojiao

84
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,719
Jiaojiao

85
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,680
Jiaojiao

86
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:36,159
Jiaojiao

87
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,279
Jiaojiao

88
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:46,680
Jiaojiao

89
00:04:47,519 --> 00:04:48,800
Dad's here to pick you up

90
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:50,599
dad

91
00:04:52,159 --> 00:04:54,000
It turns out that when people are dying

92
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,120
I can really see my deceased loved ones

93
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,440
Come with me

94
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,120
No one will pick you up again

95
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,560
Jiaojiaoguai

96
00:05:05,399 --> 00:05:07,120
Dad will take you to buy candied haws

97
00:05:07,719 --> 00:05:09,279
Just like when I was a kid

98
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:22,880
Jiang Niangzi

99
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:25,760
Bachelor Cui

100
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:26,839
My sister is blessed

101
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:29,240
Dangerous

102
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,120
Young Master Prime Minister is going to have an accident

103
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:32,800
Let's go quick

104
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:34,240
Don't get burned

105
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:35,760
Don't go, you guys. What are you talking about

106
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:36,800
Jiang Niangzi

107
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:40,399
Jiang Niangzi

108
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,880
Jiaojiaoguai

109
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,240
Jiaojiao

110
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:50,920
Call me Jiaojiao

111
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,480
Teach me to be pity

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,760
But bullied me for being delicate

113
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:58,440
In this world, it's a curse to be Jiaojiao

114
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:01,680
I hate this nickname

115
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:03,159
Dad, don't you remember

116
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,199
Come with me

117
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:09,920
You're not my father

118
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,599
You're an illusion

119
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,920
despair

120
00:06:13,279 --> 00:06:14,480
And death

121
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,560
Jiang Niangzi

122
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,800
Jiaojiao

123
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:28,240
Jiaojiao

124
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:30,920
Cui Yongzi

125
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,760
Niang Niang Niang

126
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,639
Jiaojiao

127
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:40,039
Jiaojiao

128
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:40,880
Mother

129
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:42,159
Are you okay

130
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,039
Mom, I'm fine

131
00:06:43,719 --> 00:06:45,159
You're so anxious

132
00:06:47,639 --> 00:06:49,880
Mom, let's go home

133
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:52,680
Jiaojiao

134
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,440
Bachelor Cui went to save you

135
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,680
He's not out yet

136
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:57,560
Cui Yongzi

137
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:08,680
Choi You-an

138
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:10,920
Jiaojiao finally waited for you

139
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:12,360
Jiaojiao

140
00:07:13,159 --> 00:07:13,680
How

141
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,599
Why are there two sisters

142
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,279
Who are you

143
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:43,279
They both fainted as soon as they came back

144
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:45,639
What exactly is the other one

145
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:52,120
I dare not go in there

146
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:56,680
Two ginger ladies are terrible

147
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,680
Could it be a monster

148
00:07:58,680 --> 00:07:59,399
Shut up

149
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,039
Find out the cause of the fire

150
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:03,760
What happened tonight must not be known to more people

151
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,519
Especially the people from the Prime Minister's House

152
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:06,719
Yes

153
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:10,320
Lord

154
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,959
The third prince is still waiting for you

155
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:19,039
So what should we do now

156
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,440
Alas

157
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:22,320
Bachelor Cui, walk slow

158
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,279
Aniang

159
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,480
Still have to find out as soon as possible

160
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:29,839
Who is the real sister

161
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,639
The marriage will be in seven days

162
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:33,839
If there are rumors about the demon

163
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,360
Don't talk about the marriage at that time

164
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:37,279
Even my imperial examination to be an official will be affected

165
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:39,000
Don't you always blame your sister

166
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,039
Did the marriage come in a disgrace

167
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:43,279
Now I want to clear my name

168
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:44,799
And think of the benefits

169
00:08:44,919 --> 00:08:46,960
You have to learn to be smart

170
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:48,639
Be kind to your sister

171
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:50,840
Our Jiang family is also pointing to your sister's marriage

172
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,880
Aniang

173
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,679
Jiaojiao

174
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:55,799
Aniang

175
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:57,600
Jiaojiao pain

176
00:09:00,519 --> 00:09:02,799
Aniang Jiaojiao hurts

177
00:09:02,799 --> 00:09:03,880
OK OK

178
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:18,799
How is Aniang?

179
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:19,799
Have you made the difference

180
00:09:20,159 --> 00:09:21,159
Aniang asked a few

181
00:09:21,159 --> 00:09:23,399
Things that only your sister knows

182
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:26,519
They can both answer

183
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:29,760
Mother

184
00:09:30,840 --> 00:09:33,039
Jiaojiao wants to drink your sweet soup

185
00:09:34,039 --> 00:09:35,760
Granny will cook sweet soup for you

186
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,200
Go quick, go quick, go quick

187
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:54,360
Hello Jiang Song

188
00:09:54,919 --> 00:09:56,039
It's nice to meet you

189
00:09:56,559 --> 00:09:57,679
This is a meeting ceremony

190
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,080
Isn't this my mother's hairpin

191
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:02,600
It's my mother's hairpin

192
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:04,159
Just now my mother tried to coax me

193
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,200
Gave it to me

194
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:06,039
give

195
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,120
Didn't you always love this

196
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,319
Who the hell are you

197
00:10:15,039 --> 00:10:16,720
Who am I

198
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,720
I won't tell you

199
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:19,840
I'm afraid of scaring you

200
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,559
But you can call me Jiaojiao

201
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:23,880
You don't like the name anyway

202
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,319
Henceforth

203
00:10:25,559 --> 00:10:26,679
Your name is Jiang Song

204
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,360
My name is Jiang Jiaojiao

205
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:33,039
Didn't expect you to survive the fire

206
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,399
Don't worry

207
00:10:34,439 --> 00:10:36,519
I'll help you restart your life

208
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:38,679
You started the fire

209
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:41,159
Not me Not me

210
00:10:41,639 --> 00:10:43,720
I'm not as unscrupulous as you

211
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,639
Not who you are

212
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:48,639
Is it God's scourge?

213
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,880
What do I have to be punished

214
00:10:51,039 --> 00:10:52,279
You're vain and snob

215
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:53,360
Deeply scheming

216
00:10:53,439 --> 00:10:54,720
Take advantage of Choi Woo-an's kindness

217
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,279
Isn't it angry enough

218
00:10:57,399 --> 00:10:58,200
Rest assured

219
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:00,639
I'll help you find a good home

220
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,720
You go back

221
00:11:03,439 --> 00:11:04,639
Be a good person

222
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:20,639
Jiaojiao

223
00:11:21,039 --> 00:11:21,840
Zhang San

224
00:11:22,519 --> 00:11:23,480
Why are you here

225
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:26,240
You just let me in through the back door at this hour

226
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,439
Then I took you away

227
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:30,880
It's her. She wants to kick me out of the Jiang house

228
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:33,600
Jiaojiao, let's elope

229
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:37,360
I'll leave the young lady of the prime minister to do it

230
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,600
Eloping with you

231
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,159
What am I drawing

232
00:11:40,960 --> 00:11:42,439
Will you open a porridge shop?

233
00:11:44,159 --> 00:11:44,880
Jiaojiao

234
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,200
It was my father who paid your family's debt

235
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,480
You and I are married

236
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,919
The engagement was made by my uncle

237
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,039
What has it to do with me

238
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:52,880
let alone

239
00:11:54,519 --> 00:11:56,399
Do you have to pay the debt with meat

240
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,760
You're not coming with me

241
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,559
I'm gonna die here today

242
00:12:02,639 --> 00:12:03,240
Don't

243
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,679
Don't let your blood

244
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:10,799
Dirty my new skirt

245
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:19,679
Bachelor Cui personally came to deliver the new wedding clothes

246
00:12:20,039 --> 00:12:21,840
It's too much trouble

247
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,399
Today, Xiu Mu brought it over on the way

248
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,200
Jiaojiao will be coming soon

249
00:12:26,679 --> 00:12:29,000
Go and put away your wedding clothes

250
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:30,720
Please wait a moment

251
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:32,159
Mrs. You Lao

252
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:46,519
Cui

253
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,000
Choi You-an

254
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,439
You're not Lady Ginger

255
00:13:32,960 --> 00:13:34,480
I'm Lady Jiang

256
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,039
But I'm not scheming against you, Jiang Song

257
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:41,799
It's Jiang Jiaojiao sent by the immortals to give you happiness

258
00:13:42,799 --> 00:13:43,840
immortal

259
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:48,519
You don't understand even if you say it

260
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,360
Anyway, you just know

261
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:53,880
I'm destined to marry you

262
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,200
What about you

263
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:56,799
Will love me

264
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,919
But I'm married to Lady Jiang

265
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:02,240
What does that matter

266
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,840
You see, we look alike anyway

267
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,439
It would be nice if you chose me

268
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,799
Are you really responsible for the so-called

269
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,200
Marry someone who plots against you

270
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,760
Your grandmother asked you to put this jade pendant

271
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,600
Give it to a good woman in love

272
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,399
Is Jiang Song worthy?

273
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:26,559
You know that too

274
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:29,399
Because I'm sent by the gods

275
00:14:36,919 --> 00:14:38,399
You daughter of a down-and-out businessman

276
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,120
Why do you look down on me

277
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,319
Why

278
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:43,960
What are you laughing about

279
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:46,639
I don't laugh Do you want me to cry

280
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:47,720
Let me beg for mercy

281
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:49,720
Stop dreaming

282
00:14:51,399 --> 00:14:53,600
Don't shake your hands when you violently attack the weak

283
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:55,799
rubbish

284
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:56,720
Shut up

285
00:14:57,120 --> 00:14:58,039
You shut up

286
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:09,039
Jiaojiao Niang will put it on for you

287
00:15:09,039 --> 00:15:10,720
Come on, this is my wedding dress

288
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,519
Yes, it's so beautiful

289
00:15:12,799 --> 00:15:14,080
This is positive red

290
00:15:14,080 --> 00:15:15,039
Really fit

291
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:16,600
Good looking, Jiujiu

292
00:15:16,799 --> 00:15:17,840
Good-looking good-

293
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,360
This embroidery is too advanced

294
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,519
Mom, I'm getting married

295
00:15:23,399 --> 00:15:24,799
Mother

296
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,919
This Bachelor Cui is also careful

297
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:28,360
Lady, you

298
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:29,519
Why are you hurt

299
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:30,639
Then marry

300
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:31,679
My mother is relieved

301
00:15:31,679 --> 00:15:32,519
Seven seven

302
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,120
You go tell her

303
00:15:35,039 --> 00:15:36,159
It's beautiful

304
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,000
Why did you ask Qi Qi to invite me here

305
00:16:02,760 --> 00:16:04,120
I've been kneeling here all day

306
00:16:04,559 --> 00:16:05,960
Seek gods and Buddhas all over the sky

307
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:08,279
I just drew a draw

308
00:16:09,439 --> 00:16:10,760
How do you guess good or bad

309
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,319
What are you asking for

310
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,720
I beg you to disappear

311
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:18,240
Second seeking

312
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:19,880
I'm married

313
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,240
If Cui You'an is not a gentleman

314
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,679
How can you succeed

315
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,840
You shouldn't force

316
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:26,039
You should repent

317
00:16:26,439 --> 00:16:27,240
Yeah

318
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:29,960
So I drawn

319
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:34,480
Sign down

320
00:16:34,919 --> 00:16:36,120
Your mind is not right

321
00:16:36,799 --> 00:16:38,720
The gods and Buddhas will not be on your side

322
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:40,720
You were supposed to die in the fire

323
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,960
I'll live for you and turn your life around

324
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:47,000
But why should I let you live my life for me

325
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:48,919
Because you live

326
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:50,360
It will only become a deep house

327
00:16:50,360 --> 00:16:51,559
A yellow faced woman

328
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,760
No thoughts

329
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,799
Without Soul

330
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:54,600
Will only

331
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,200
Female competition with male

332
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:57,559
And I'm different

333
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,519
In my old life

334
00:16:59,799 --> 00:17:00,840
What I learned in a day

335
00:17:00,840 --> 00:17:02,840
Beyond your reach in your life

336
00:17:03,559 --> 00:17:04,240
My mind

337
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,840
Comparable to the most outstanding men of this era

338
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:09,559
Am on an equal footing with them

339
00:17:10,760 --> 00:17:12,079
The difference between us

340
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,640
Is the gap between the old and the new world

341
00:17:13,640 --> 00:17:14,599
It's not your fault

342
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:18,000
It's this age that makes a woman like you

343
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,960
You have too many flaws

344
00:17:20,359 --> 00:17:22,559
No matter how beautiful porcelain is, it is worthless if it has cracks

345
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:23,920
And I'm different

346
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:25,879
I am perfect

347
00:17:31,119 --> 00:17:31,839
What are you laughing about

348
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:34,680
Fortunately

349
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:36,079
Fortunately for what

350
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,319
Fortunately, I survived

351
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,640
Otherwise my story

352
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:43,720
Wouldn't I let you tell it completely

353
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:46,400
Reduced to the stain you used to be in the human population

354
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:47,920
But who am I

355
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,720
I have the final say

356
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:52,279
If I want to speak out

357
00:17:52,599 --> 00:17:53,680
No one to cover his mouth

358
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:55,440
Natural disasters do not work

359
00:17:56,119 --> 00:17:57,000
Man-made disaster

360
00:17:58,039 --> 00:17:58,960
No way either

361
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,720
You

362
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,359
You, you killed him

363
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,279
What a pity

364
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:11,359
Still dirty my new dress

365
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,279
This lady

366
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:16,000
Do you really think I live in this world

367
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,279
What goodness will it be

368
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:19,359
Stupid man

369
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,839
I got the next draw

370
00:18:22,319 --> 00:18:24,000
It's the gods telling me

371
00:18:24,879 --> 00:18:26,839
Don't expect to be signed

372
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:31,720
But I've never been signed in my life

373
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:33,319
confession

374
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,319
Why should I repent

375
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,920
Why am I wrong

376
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:40,440
I'm fighting out of this bog

377
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,359
Be the one who climbs the branch

378
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,879
Lingxiao flower

379
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:51,879
Jiang Niangzi

380
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:58,760
look

381
00:18:58,879 --> 00:18:59,879
This day of his month

382
00:18:59,879 --> 00:19:01,760
Everyone comes here to pray for all beings

383
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:03,799
Such a nice person

384
00:19:04,519 --> 00:19:06,000
Why should I give you it

385
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,400
What I ask for

386
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,200
God won't give me

387
00:19:12,879 --> 00:19:14,279
I'll take it myself
