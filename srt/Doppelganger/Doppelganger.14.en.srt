1
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,519
All right

2
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,640
This is dust to dust to dust

3
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,200
We can go back and resume our lives

4
00:01:41,799 --> 00:01:42,599
General Shen

5
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:46,840
Come back to the palace with our family to receive the Holy Reward

6
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,799
Where is this

7
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,000
Let us out

8
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:06,120
Help, Jiang Song

9
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,360
Let us out, Jiang Song

10
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:08,640
Let us out. What is this place?

11
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,159
Let us out

12
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,239
General Shen said

13
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:13,799
All we're drinking is suspended animation

14
00:02:14,159 --> 00:02:16,240
After deceiving the old eunuch, he will take us away safely

15
00:02:16,359 --> 00:02:17,599
But why are we here

16
00:02:17,919 --> 00:02:19,080
You believe Shen Que's words

17
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,479
He's trying to kill us

18
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:22,919
No, I believe Shen Che

19
00:02:23,159 --> 00:02:24,000
He will definitely come and save us

20
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,800
Let's find a way to get out

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:25,680
So what do we do now

22
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:26,280
Kick together

23
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:45,120
be careful

24
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,439
Escort the father-in-law first

25
00:02:59,639 --> 00:03:00,800
General Shen, save me

26
00:03:01,479 --> 00:03:01,800
go

27
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:34,039
General

28
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:34,560
go

29
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,120
I'm out of breath

30
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,400
Jiang Song

31
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:42,119
General Shen Que Shen

32
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:42,919
Quick

33
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:43,799
Save them first

34
00:04:43,799 --> 00:04:44,239
Good

35
00:04:48,159 --> 00:04:48,880
Come on

36
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:51,280
come

37
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:02,359
Slow down

38
00:05:03,239 --> 00:05:03,720
go

39
00:05:03,999 --> 00:05:04,479
go

40
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:17,679
And so on

41
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:24,760
Put out the torch quickly

42
00:05:31,559 --> 00:05:32,039
go

43
00:05:37,559 --> 00:05:39,440
Kill

44
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:39,960
Run fast

45
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,320
Shen Que

46
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:55,479
Choi You-an

47
00:05:55,999 --> 00:05:56,760
Don't come over

48
00:05:59,239 --> 00:05:59,919
Don't come over

49
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:02,119
Jiang Song

50
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,679
Shen Que really won't let you die

51
00:06:15,239 --> 00:06:15,999
Come back with me

52
00:06:17,119 --> 00:06:17,720
I don't want it

53
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:18,679
OK

54
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:22,359
Then all of them will die

55
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:24,840
General Shen be careful

56
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:26,159
Watch out for General Shen

57
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:36,159
Why don't you just let me go

58
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:38,119
Because you're mine

59
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:40,440
Do you love me

60
00:06:41,479 --> 00:06:41,999
NO

61
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:45,039
You're just a heartless monster

62
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:45,720
That's enough

63
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:46,999
It's not important

64
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,520
Do you know what love is

65
00:06:52,679 --> 00:06:54,440
The living can die

66
00:06:55,239 --> 00:06:56,359
The dead can give birth

67
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,159
This is love

68
00:06:58,679 --> 00:07:00,599
Do you understand

69
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,999
Why should I know the love of a coward

70
00:07:03,799 --> 00:07:04,760
Shen really loves you

71
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:06,520
But he's gonna die for you

72
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:23,760
Come back with me

73
00:07:24,359 --> 00:07:25,159
I let them go

74
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,640
I am not yours

75
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:33,919
I am my own

76
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:36,159
Fame and fortune

77
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:37,559
Wealth

78
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:39,479
Power

79
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,919
Nothing can control me Jiang Song

80
00:07:42,359 --> 00:07:44,039
Including you, Choi Woo-an

81
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:48,400
You come back

82
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:50,359
I'll just jump

83
00:07:52,559 --> 00:07:53,599
Don't play tricks with me

84
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:55,440
I won't fall for it

85
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:16,640
So this is the pain

86
00:08:33,239 --> 00:08:33,760
Jiang Song

87
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,200
Jiang Song

88
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:39,720
Are you okay

89
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:40,720
I'm fine

90
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:43,720
I killed him

91
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,720
I killed him

92
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:51,560
done

93
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:52,960
It's okay

94
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,239
I killed him

95
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,840
don't

96
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,320
don't

97
00:09:10,879 --> 00:09:11,279
Jiang Song

98
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,960
I'm here

99
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,560
Shen Que

100
00:09:19,639 --> 00:09:20,239
I'm in

101
00:09:23,999 --> 00:09:24,639
Shen Que

102
00:09:25,639 --> 00:09:26,840
Is it all over

103
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,440
It's all over

104
00:09:37,999 --> 00:09:38,920
Blame me for not protecting you

105
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:42,080
You don't say that

106
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:43,999
You saved us all

107
00:09:45,399 --> 00:09:46,399
You did a great job

108
00:09:50,479 --> 00:09:51,040
Shen Que

109
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,160
You're not killing innocent people

110
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Didn't let me down

111
00:09:59,320 --> 00:09:59,879
Thank you

112
00:10:04,239 --> 00:10:07,599
What if I'm not as good as you think

113
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:15,800
How is she

114
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:19,119
Jiang Niangzi's eyes were only blurred at first

115
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:20,440
But after this experience

116
00:10:21,399 --> 00:10:22,279
Body weakness

117
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,080
Deepening of toxicity

118
00:10:23,759 --> 00:10:24,519
If you still can't solve it

119
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:26,639
I'm afraid I'll be blind forever

120
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:28,080
General

121
00:10:28,519 --> 00:10:29,680
If Lady Jiang can't see

122
00:10:29,999 --> 00:10:31,119
So you can keep her

123
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:31,960
Amo

124
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,279
The general likes Lady Jiang so much

125
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,800
Don't you want the general to be happy

126
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,040
What about Lady Jiang

127
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,279
Would she be willing

128
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:38,440
Will she be happy

129
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:38,759
You

130
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:39,440
Stop talking

131
00:10:57,599 --> 00:11:02,599
I thought I finally had someone to love

132
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:05,960
I was finally needed

133
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,119
I can finally be seen

134
00:11:12,359 --> 00:11:18,320
Once again, I was ignored

135
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:20,920
Be fooled

136
00:11:22,759 --> 00:11:24,160
Abandoned

137
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,359
Ghost

138
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,599
Jiang Jiaojiao, you're awake

139
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,119
You saved me again

140
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,160
I told you you were the heroine

141
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:01,040
Of course you can't die

142
00:12:02,359 --> 00:12:03,399
What else do you want

143
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,920
A more beautiful look

144
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,279
Or a more noble status

145
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:12,399
I want to have

146
00:12:15,479 --> 00:12:17,040
Choi You-an's life

147
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,560
He is the leading man

148
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:25,239
No one can kill him

149
00:12:26,119 --> 00:12:26,999
Unless

150
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,560
His own desire to die

151
00:13:09,479 --> 00:13:11,119
I thought she could save me

152
00:13:12,239 --> 00:13:12,960
Unexpectedly

153
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,680
She's here to kill me

154
00:14:49,999 --> 00:14:50,840
You're not dead

155
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:53,879
Yeah

156
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,200
I'm not gonna die

157
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,200
Antidote

158
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,160
The antidote is here

159
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:04,040
But take it away

160
00:15:06,119 --> 00:15:06,920
What are the conditions

161
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:11,599
Take a hundred sticks

162
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:12,960
Don't fight back

163
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,279
Is there any point in you doing this

164
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,399
I want to see what Jiang Song said

165
00:15:21,479 --> 00:15:22,800
That amazing love

166
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:26,960
If you're afraid, you can turn back

167
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:30,359
As for the antidote

168
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,960
Good

169
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,119
It's so affectionate

170
00:16:09,999 --> 00:16:10,639
Shen Que

171
00:16:11,639 --> 00:16:12,279
Jiang Niangzi

172
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,840
You're awake

173
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:16,119
Miaohua

174
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:17,200
Where's Shen Que

175
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:18,119
He

176
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,840
Don't tell her I went to get the antidote

177
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,239
He went to catch the thief

178
00:16:23,879 --> 00:16:24,399
Miaohua

179
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:25,639
You tell the truth

180
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:26,720
Where did he go

181
00:16:27,160 --> 00:16:27,599
I

182
00:16:27,999 --> 00:16:28,599
You say

183
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,080
The general went to get you the antidote

184
00:16:30,479 --> 00:16:31,119
Amo

185
00:16:32,519 --> 00:16:33,160
Jiang Niangzi

186
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:34,800
Could you stay for the general

187
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:36,200
All these years

188
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:39,599
He's too lonely by himself

189
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,720
Shen Que

190
00:17:17,440 --> 00:17:19,039
Even if you have the life to get the cure

191
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,200
She'll still go

192
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:21,759
Why bother

193
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,039
Antidote

194
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:26,720
Good

195
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:28,920
I'll fulfill you

196
00:17:40,559 --> 00:17:41,479
One hundred sticks

197
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,559
Here we go
