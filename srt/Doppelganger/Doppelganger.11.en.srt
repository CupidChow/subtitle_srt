1
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:56,961
Is You-an here

2
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,840
You're his nurse

3
00:00:59,041 --> 00:01:00,281
He will definitely come

4
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:02,120
Chan Niang, don't wait for him

5
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:04,240
He just thinks you're a servant

6
00:01:05,480 --> 00:01:07,961
He loves to eat my lotus pond fish cakes best

7
00:01:08,721 --> 00:01:11,401
When I die, you remember

8
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:12,681
Cicada Niang Cicada Niang

9
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:14,080
Cicada Niang

10
00:01:14,521 --> 00:01:15,241
Cicada Niang

11
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,401
Cicada Niang's father

12
00:01:17,401 --> 00:01:18,521
Are you upset

13
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,360
Cicada Niang

14
00:01:20,521 --> 00:01:21,360
I don't know

15
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:22,161
Cicada Niang

16
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,241
But

17
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,000
Cicada Niang took care of me when I grew up

18
00:01:26,521 --> 00:01:28,801
I should've cried when she died

19
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,761
But I have no tears

20
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:34,360
They call me a cold-blooded monster behind my back

21
00:01:34,761 --> 00:01:36,321
Is that really the case, father

22
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,000
Only the incompetent can be sentimental

23
00:01:39,521 --> 00:01:40,801
Just a servant who died

24
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:43,161
Just find a replacement

25
00:01:45,161 --> 00:01:46,321
Don't be a piece of crap

26
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:48,961
I understand, father

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,041
I didn't expect it to be so powerful

28
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:05,280
Someone who can almost control everything

29
00:02:06,241 --> 00:02:07,720
How could it be so fragile

30
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,281
Cicada Niang

31
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:17,321
Cicada Niang

32
00:02:17,881 --> 00:02:18,561
By the way

33
00:02:18,721 --> 00:02:20,001
It's his nurse

34
00:02:20,561 --> 00:02:22,480
The hero's childhood trauma

35
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,080
I didn't see Cicada Niang for the last time

36
00:02:26,041 --> 00:02:27,761
Why did Cicada Niang die?

37
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,960
No more impression

38
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:31,721
but

39
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,480
In the end, I created your pain

40
00:02:44,561 --> 00:02:45,321
Who are you

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,400
I

42
00:02:48,121 --> 00:02:49,200
I'm Jiang Jiaojiao

43
00:02:50,441 --> 00:02:51,080
Wrong

44
00:02:51,881 --> 00:02:52,721
Who are you

45
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:54,640
I

46
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,041
I

47
00:03:00,281 --> 00:03:01,321
He's like this

48
00:03:01,721 --> 00:03:02,721
So pitiful

49
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:05,601
Whether what Jiang Song said is true or not

50
00:03:05,721 --> 00:03:06,640
The heroine is me

51
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,161
I'll definitely be able to fight him

52
00:03:09,121 --> 00:03:10,001
I'm Jiang Song

53
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:11,520
Cui Yongzi

54
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:16,281
I thought you were gone

55
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,441
I'm back again

56
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:22,240
Are you not mad at me

57
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:26,441
You just don't know how to love someone

58
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,441
You're not wrong

59
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:29,920
Let me warm you

60
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:30,960
Make up to you

61
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:32,920
Teach you how to love others

62
00:03:40,761 --> 00:03:41,400
Young Lady

63
00:03:44,761 --> 00:03:45,680
Young lady, are you hungry

64
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:46,520
Please have some first

65
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:47,640
I'll take care of Lang Jun

66
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:48,960
You have a taste

67
00:03:51,441 --> 00:03:52,601
But it's also to your taste

68
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,520
Nice

69
00:03:53,721 --> 00:03:55,601
But it's still incomparable to what you did

70
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:56,721
What I made

71
00:03:57,001 --> 00:03:58,561
Yeah, Lang Jun mentioned it

72
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,200
Your lotus pond fish cakes

73
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,680
Very similar to the craftsmanship of Cicada Niang

74
00:04:05,841 --> 00:04:08,680
Cui You'an won't put his feelings for Chan Niang

75
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,321
Is it transferred to Jiang Song?

76
00:04:11,441 --> 00:04:14,161
What if I could make this fish cake too

77
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,640
Will he treat me differently

78
00:06:30,921 --> 00:06:33,640
All the criminal women who committed crimes today are here

79
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,080
Of course, there will be a guilty woman in jail tomorrow

80
00:06:39,481 --> 00:06:40,400
Father-in-law Deming

81
00:06:40,921 --> 00:06:42,561
Can you give me some more time

82
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:44,040
We must find out which woman it is

83
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:46,280
Would rather kill three thousand by mistake

84
00:06:46,681 --> 00:06:48,121
Don't let one go

85
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,600
Your foster father always acted like this

86
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:54,160
Why is the general so soft-hearted

87
00:06:54,801 --> 00:06:56,121
The woman will never die

88
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:59,561
Your Majesty is uneasy for a moment

89
00:07:00,121 --> 00:07:01,121
But these women

90
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,840
Most of them didn't commit the most evil crimes

91
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,640
There are still few ghosts under the general's sword

92
00:07:05,881 --> 00:07:08,160
Still afraid of more of these

93
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,121
Fish cake fish cake

94
00:07:15,121 --> 00:07:16,761
Fresh fish cakes

95
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:18,361
Selling fish cakes

96
00:07:18,881 --> 00:07:20,280
Would you like fish cakes, girl

97
00:07:20,761 --> 00:07:21,840
Bacon

98
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:24,720
Have a taste

99
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,921
Home-dried bacon

100
00:07:31,681 --> 00:07:34,840
What is the taste of cicada mother like

101
00:07:35,681 --> 00:07:36,361
Ginger

102
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,280
Why are you back

103
00:07:38,681 --> 00:07:40,001
I went to the city gate

104
00:07:40,321 --> 00:07:42,520
Only to find that I can't escape at all

105
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,600
You know why, right

106
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:46,761
I know

107
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,881
Why

108
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,761
I can tell you

109
00:07:50,121 --> 00:07:51,640
But you have to do me a favor first

110
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,280
what

111
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,121
Teach me how to make lotus pond fish cakes

112
00:07:56,681 --> 00:07:57,801
I heard you did it

113
00:07:57,921 --> 00:07:59,801
It's very similar to Choi Woo-an's craftsmanship

114
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,520
I learned this fish cake

115
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,600
Maybe Choi Woo-an will put his feelings for you

116
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,921
Transfer to me

117
00:08:06,801 --> 00:08:08,520
You hope so too, don't you

118
00:08:14,001 --> 00:08:14,960
Give way

119
00:08:16,321 --> 00:08:17,400
It's time to tell me

120
00:08:17,561 --> 00:08:19,280
Then I have to wait for Choi You-an to taste it

121
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,600
I'll tell you if the taste is right

122
00:08:20,881 --> 00:08:22,200
I knew you were gonna cheat

123
00:08:22,441 --> 00:08:24,280
So there's a step I haven't taught yet

124
00:08:24,681 --> 00:08:25,080
You

125
00:08:25,241 --> 00:08:26,160
When you tell me

126
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:28,280
I'll give you all the secret recipes

127
00:08:28,681 --> 00:08:29,441
OK

128
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:31,080
Then you have to wait until I come back first

129
00:08:32,481 --> 00:08:33,200
By the way

130
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:36,561
When I first came to this world

131
00:08:36,561 --> 00:08:37,520
You lend me silver

132
00:08:37,801 --> 00:08:38,961
Double repayment

133
00:08:40,081 --> 00:08:41,121
You're stealing

134
00:08:41,721 --> 00:08:44,001
Actually, I do owe you an excuse me

135
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:47,001
Let the money be regarded as compensation for you

136
00:08:48,361 --> 00:08:49,640
You have a little conscience

137
00:08:53,881 --> 00:08:54,680
Don't look back

138
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:55,841
Choi You-an is behind you

139
00:09:02,361 --> 00:09:03,320
Jiang Song

140
00:09:03,841 --> 00:09:04,920
You go over there and wait for me

141
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:05,680
I'll block him

142
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,001
husband

143
00:09:20,361 --> 00:09:21,121
Why are you here

144
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,761
I know that you will go to Tianqing Temple on this day every month

145
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,520
So I'm here to wait for you

146
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:29,640
Zhiqiu said that you love lotus pond fish cakes best

147
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,040
So I did a little bit

148
00:09:32,081 --> 00:09:33,241
Young Master Cui said

149
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:34,920
I made the lotus pond fish cakes

150
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,520
Much like the craft of an old friend of yours

151
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:38,121
So I did some

152
00:09:39,761 --> 00:09:40,560
How did you learn that

153
00:09:41,081 --> 00:09:43,001
I tried hundreds of recipes

154
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,361
Studying for a long time

155
00:09:44,961 --> 00:09:46,320
Might not be good enough

156
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:48,001
Sorry

157
00:09:48,241 --> 00:09:49,160
I'm so stupid

158
00:09:58,361 --> 00:09:58,961
Does it hurt

159
00:10:04,361 --> 00:10:05,680
You don't have to imitate her in the future

160
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,520
The world is gone without her

161
00:10:08,961 --> 00:10:10,121
So do you still like her

162
00:10:11,121 --> 00:10:12,400
Would you like me then

163
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,520
How do I have to get you to like me

164
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:17,680
You tell me

165
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:18,881
I can learn anything

166
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:33,081
As long as you obey

167
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:35,841
You will always be the young lady of the prime minister

168
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:47,640
Sister, I want to be good too

169
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,721
I have them all

170
00:10:48,721 --> 00:10:49,601
I want it too I want it too

171
00:10:49,601 --> 00:10:50,841
Don't grab, don't grab, I want it too

172
00:10:50,841 --> 00:10:51,481
All have

173
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,280
I want it too

174
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,640
Come and thank you sister

175
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,400
Here thank you sister

176
00:11:06,121 --> 00:11:06,761
What's wrong with you

177
00:11:12,721 --> 00:11:14,440
You want to know the truth about the world

178
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:15,800
of course

179
00:11:16,601 --> 00:11:18,361
Okay, I'll tell you

180
00:11:30,520 --> 00:11:31,201
Why

181
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:32,640
Mrs. Cui

182
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,361
She stole your purse, didn't she

183
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,241
Right

184
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,160
The purse was on her

185
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,680
The seal of the Prime Minister's Mansion is also inside

186
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,400
Why

187
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,560
Sure enough, it is the property of the Prime Minister's

188
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:47,241
All witnesses and physical evidence

189
00:11:47,241 --> 00:11:48,081
What else do you have to say

190
00:11:49,001 --> 00:11:50,400
I didn't want to do this

191
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,721
But you can't get out of this city

192
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:54,400
Then it can only disappear

193
00:11:55,241 --> 00:11:55,721
This way

194
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:58,320
Only Choi You-an can see me

195
00:11:58,881 --> 00:12:00,800
Why can't I escape this city

196
00:12:01,280 --> 00:12:02,680
What exactly is out of town

197
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,001
Even if you burn my book

198
00:12:04,001 --> 00:12:05,320
You can't beat me

199
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:06,961
Because

200
00:12:07,081 --> 00:12:07,680
go

201
00:12:08,201 --> 00:12:08,920
Finish it for me

202
00:12:09,280 --> 00:12:09,881
Why

203
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,320
Let me go

204
00:12:11,881 --> 00:12:12,680
Finish it for me

205
00:12:12,961 --> 00:12:14,601
Come on, finish talking to me Jiang Jiaojiao

206
00:12:14,961 --> 00:12:15,721
Jiang Jiaojiao

207
00:12:15,721 --> 00:12:16,680
Because

208
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:19,680
I am the author of this novel

209
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:21,841
The plot is all in my head

210
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,280
After the Third Prince ascended the throne, he was fatuous

211
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,320
Choi You'an was pushed to the throne of God

212
00:12:27,601 --> 00:12:28,761
And I

213
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,920
Will become a queen

214
00:12:34,361 --> 00:12:35,920
The guilty women of these two days

215
00:12:36,481 --> 00:12:37,361
It's all here

216
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:40,881
A great achievement, General Shen

217
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:46,961
How could it be Lady Jiang

218
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,560
How

219
00:12:50,241 --> 00:12:51,721
The general knows this woman

220
00:12:53,761 --> 00:12:55,160
If the general wants to protect her

221
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,400
Our family can report to Your Majesty

222
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:57,881
need not

223
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,361
I don't know her

224
00:13:05,081 --> 00:13:06,081
Is it

225
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:12,680
If that's the case, then our family will dispose of it at will

226
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,481
It looks lovely

227
00:13:34,761 --> 00:13:36,280
Haven't served anyone

228
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:37,881
What a pity

229
00:13:39,481 --> 00:13:40,201
Father-in-law

230
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:44,320
I'm afraid this is wrong

231
00:13:44,361 --> 00:13:45,160
How

232
00:13:45,721 --> 00:13:47,160
A guilty woman

233
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,320
Our family can't be touched

234
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,680
Or does the general mean

235
00:13:52,520 --> 00:13:54,961
Eunuch doesn't deserve to touch women

236
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,961
What are you doing

237
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:03,761
Let me go

238
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:07,040
Let go, you

239
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,601
You let me go

240
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,280
Let go

241
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,280
You let go

242
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,640
General, he's trying to provoke you

243
00:14:22,761 --> 00:14:23,520
Let me go

244
00:14:26,841 --> 00:14:27,881
Release

245
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:45,481
General Shen

246
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,520
You want to protect this woman

247
00:14:48,081 --> 00:14:49,640
It is against Your Majesty

248
00:14:49,881 --> 00:14:52,280
Have you thought it out

249
00:14:54,121 --> 00:14:55,160
Father-in-law misunderstood

250
00:14:56,361 --> 00:14:57,680
It's just this woman

251
00:14:58,201 --> 00:14:59,481
It happens to be what I like

252
00:15:00,601 --> 00:15:03,040
I wonder if my father-in-law can give up love

253
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:07,640
The general also wants to taste beauty

254
00:15:08,721 --> 00:15:09,440
Exactly

255
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,520
The general is full of energy

256
00:15:11,721 --> 00:15:13,400
Our family naturally can't take away love

257
00:15:14,121 --> 00:15:15,001
Someone's coming

258
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,160
No arrangements for the general yet

259
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,241
Yes

260
00:15:29,320 --> 00:15:30,721
Jiang Jiaojiao is over

261
00:15:32,001 --> 00:15:33,601
Jiang Song won't appear again

262
00:15:34,520 --> 00:15:36,001
I have a lifetime with him

263
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,400
You can take your time

264
00:15:53,881 --> 00:15:54,881
husband

265
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,241
I understand you can't let her go so quickly

266
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,520
But now I'm your wife

267
00:16:34,001 --> 00:16:35,560
Can you give me a chance

268
00:16:35,721 --> 00:16:37,320
Give yourself a chance too

269
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,121
Maybe you can have me in your heart

270
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:00,121
adopted father

271
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:03,440
Why did it become a good thing for Shen Que?

272
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,601
What do you know

273
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,241
Shen Quefei is a thing in the pool

274
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,001
Your Majesty wants him to arrest the guilty woman

275
00:17:11,001 --> 00:17:13,360
Obviously to test his loyalty

276
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:14,641
He wants the woman

277
00:17:14,961 --> 00:17:17,401
Our family pinched him up

278
00:17:17,961 --> 00:17:20,961
He'll have to honor our family in the future

279
00:17:22,201 --> 00:17:23,761
You have to be the michel platini

280
00:17:25,201 --> 00:17:26,280
Didn't you say you were leaving

281
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:27,481
Why are you back again

282
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:29,961
I found I couldn't go

283
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,001
Why

284
00:17:33,921 --> 00:17:34,761
I don't know

285
00:17:35,241 --> 00:17:37,921
So I'm gonna come back and ask someone for answers

286
00:17:43,441 --> 00:17:46,280
So I got myself here

287
00:17:48,921 --> 00:17:49,600
That's all

288
00:17:50,681 --> 00:17:51,681
Nothing to do with me

289
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:56,880
Do you know what crimes those women have committed

290
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:04,161
Is it okay to kill innocent people indiscriminately for the sake of Tiger Charm

291
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:10,681
Why

292
00:18:11,241 --> 00:18:12,681
You're not such a person

293
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,880
Who do you think I am

294
00:18:23,921 --> 00:18:26,921
The knife in my hand cut off countless heads

295
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,761
In exchange for today

296
00:18:29,161 --> 00:18:31,520
I'm not like some pampered boy

297
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,241
What do you care about benevolence, justice, morality, etiquette, integrity and shame

298
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:37,800
How

299
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:39,280
See me for who I am

300
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,641
Disappointed

301
00:18:44,961 --> 00:18:46,161
In order to get the tiger charm

302
00:18:46,961 --> 00:18:48,961
I don't even care about those lives

303
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,840
Including you

304
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,320
No exception

305
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:00,520
But aren't you saving me now

306
00:19:01,481 --> 00:19:02,481
You think too much

307
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,520
What are you doing

308
00:19:11,961 --> 00:19:12,800
You're serious

309
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:15,401
Otherwise
