1
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,641
Come soon

2
00:00:55,681 --> 00:00:56,760
Eat more

3
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,120
You see, you have lost weight

4
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,001
Is it sad

5
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,321
Look at your virtue now

6
00:01:07,561 --> 00:01:08,520
Having nothing

7
00:01:09,721 --> 00:01:10,681
So what

8
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:12,121
Can I help you

9
00:01:15,281 --> 00:01:16,361
How can you help me

10
00:01:16,481 --> 00:01:17,561
Jiang Jiaojiao thought

11
00:01:17,561 --> 00:01:19,481
She is the creator of this world

12
00:01:19,481 --> 00:01:20,240
She's wrong

13
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,121
She once made a wish to God

14
00:01:22,401 --> 00:01:23,761
So God according to her novel

15
00:01:23,761 --> 00:01:25,361
Created a perfect life for her

16
00:01:25,481 --> 00:01:26,641
But she doesn't know how to cherish it

17
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,561
So she's trapped in her own nightmare

18
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:30,841
Fall

19
00:01:31,201 --> 00:01:32,121
Fall

20
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:33,880
Snap

21
00:01:34,401 --> 00:01:37,080
Her internal organs were completely broken

22
00:01:38,361 --> 00:01:40,520
Time after time

23
00:01:41,001 --> 00:01:41,680
That's enough

24
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,561
What are you panicking about

25
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,721
This is a great thing for you

26
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,800
You alone in the novel

27
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:49,761
Little people who haven't lived a chapter

28
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:51,800
Now is your chance

29
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:53,921
What opportunity

30
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,040
Didn't you always want to leave

31
00:01:56,841 --> 00:01:59,361
The heroine is the key to connecting the two worlds

32
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,520
You just have to be Jiang Jiaojiao and become the heroine

33
00:02:02,641 --> 00:02:03,841
End this story

34
00:02:04,361 --> 00:02:06,281
You can open the city gates and be free

35
00:02:06,561 --> 00:02:09,841
From a few lines of text to a real person

36
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,080
What if I don't

37
00:02:12,481 --> 00:02:13,281
NO

38
00:02:14,961 --> 00:02:15,681
Come with me

39
00:02:22,721 --> 00:02:24,440
Is it good-looking

40
00:02:25,081 --> 00:02:25,880
You wear it

41
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,320
Soo Soo

42
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:31,281
Show up

43
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:33,320
She escaped too

44
00:02:33,681 --> 00:02:34,640
Resisted

45
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,360
Finally cornered

46
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,281
Be forced home

47
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,841
And then go crazy

48
00:02:40,081 --> 00:02:40,961
It's not just her

49
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:42,640
Do you think

50
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:45,600
How did Adie go crazy

51
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,920
In this world

52
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:52,401
Disobedience

53
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:54,640
You can only become a crazy woman

54
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,320
Now you have three options

55
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,081
One is to become them

56
00:02:59,721 --> 00:03:02,001
Second, listen to me

57
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:03,801
Become Jiang Jiaojiao

58
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,040
Third,

59
00:03:09,521 --> 00:03:10,841
To ask Shen Que

60
00:03:11,561 --> 00:03:12,401
just

61
00:03:13,081 --> 00:03:14,640
But seeing newcomers laugh

62
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,561
I don't see the old man crying

63
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:20,841
Will he still help you

64
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:28,360
Who am I to make the choice you give me

65
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,081
I don't even choose

66
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:34,001
You think you can escape

67
00:03:34,001 --> 00:03:35,001
I'm not running away

68
00:03:36,801 --> 00:03:38,440
Thanks for showing me to see them

69
00:03:39,241 --> 00:03:40,281
To make me understand

70
00:03:41,121 --> 00:03:43,681
Escape shouldn't be a woman's destiny

71
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,200
Weakness only transfers power

72
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,241
What I want to do

73
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,001
It should be rooted in this soil

74
00:03:52,281 --> 00:03:54,241
No matter how barren or bad

75
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:55,760
I

76
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,880
I also want to break out of my own world

77
00:04:00,081 --> 00:04:00,961
What a pity

78
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:02,760
This world

79
00:04:04,001 --> 00:04:05,561
It's coming to an end

80
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:07,640
What do you mean

81
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:10,480
It's a fantasy world

82
00:04:10,841 --> 00:04:13,121
Is a giant ship about to sink

83
00:04:13,521 --> 00:04:15,241
Even if you don't be Jiang Jiaojiao

84
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:17,320
When it comes to the end, it will end

85
00:04:17,841 --> 00:04:18,880
Why not seize the chance

86
00:04:19,081 --> 00:04:20,600
Win a new ticket

87
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,800
Start a real life

88
00:04:25,281 --> 00:04:26,081
How much longer

89
00:04:26,321 --> 00:04:27,360
Ten days

90
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,881
This young one belongs to me

91
00:04:34,401 --> 00:04:35,721
This older man

92
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:36,920
Let's go together

93
00:04:37,201 --> 00:04:38,240
Then thank Young Master Qin

94
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,721
Come and have a sip

95
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,881
Fill whatever you want

96
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:41,240
come

97
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:42,360
I won't pursue it if I die

98
00:04:42,961 --> 00:04:44,480
Drink, let you drink

99
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,600
I'll do it

100
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,560
I thought you ran away

101
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,920
So I went to buy wine to honor you, Master Qin

102
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:56,480
Yeah

103
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,761
Let me honor

104
00:05:03,761 --> 00:05:04,881
Your uncle

105
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,761
Are you seeking death

106
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,441
What are you doing

107
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,281
Yeah

108
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,360
Let my friend go

109
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:27,480
Or I'll burn this place down

110
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:28,800
Qin Yongzi

111
00:05:29,281 --> 00:05:30,281
Let him go now

112
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:31,201
Yeah

113
00:05:31,201 --> 00:05:31,800
Let me go

114
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:32,480
Shut up

115
00:05:35,641 --> 00:05:36,961
I don't believe you dare

116
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:39,000
I'll count three

117
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:41,721
three

118
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:45,600
two

119
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,881
Stop

120
00:05:51,321 --> 00:05:51,920
Release

121
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,081
Go quickly

122
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,961
As soon as you get out

123
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,600
I'll send someone to bring you back right away

124
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,721
Next time you can't run

125
00:06:03,721 --> 00:06:05,160
Someone wants to hear it

126
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,641
Qin Yongzi at the Princess's Birthday Banquet

127
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:09,401
A handmaid is frivolous

128
00:06:09,401 --> 00:06:11,841
The story of being punished by the princess with fifty staff

129
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,081
Nonsense

130
00:06:13,721 --> 00:06:14,800
False remarks

131
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,721
It seems that

132
00:06:15,721 --> 00:06:18,040
Young Master Qin was ill in bed some time ago

133
00:06:18,201 --> 00:06:18,841
Is it true

134
00:06:18,961 --> 00:06:20,800
Actually, I have heard of it vaguely

135
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,560
Also

136
00:06:21,841 --> 00:06:25,081
Young Master Qin bought a geisha a few days ago

137
00:06:25,401 --> 00:06:27,881
When I wanted to do something rainy, I found

138
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:28,560
Shut up

139
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:30,800
Yourself

140
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:33,441
No way

141
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,360
How the hell do you know

142
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,680
If I and my friends are damaged at all

143
00:06:40,401 --> 00:06:42,120
The whole capital will know

144
00:06:42,641 --> 00:06:45,600
All the scandals of your Young Master Qin's life

145
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:47,360
Understand

146
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,201
One more thing

147
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,920
I want you to release Dongmei

148
00:06:53,281 --> 00:06:55,961
Your losses will be paid back slowly

149
00:06:56,441 --> 00:06:58,000
I really can't help this

150
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,321
How can there be no way

151
00:07:00,641 --> 00:07:04,401
According to the law, the mountain master can only be released if he doesn't pursue it

152
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,401
I put that mountain yesterday

153
00:07:06,521 --> 00:07:08,000
Gave it to my brother-in-law Shen Que

154
00:07:08,841 --> 00:07:09,881
You have to save her

155
00:07:10,401 --> 00:07:11,600
Gotta go find him

156
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:19,560
It's okay

157
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:21,000
It seems that Soo Soo's family

158
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,680
Still no repentance at all

159
00:07:23,401 --> 00:07:24,961
It looks good, Xiu Xiu, don't move

160
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:25,920
Miscombed

161
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:26,680
Soo Soo

162
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:28,560
No matter what

163
00:07:28,841 --> 00:07:29,961
As long as everyone is together

164
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:31,521
Days will always get better

165
00:07:32,521 --> 00:07:33,721
It's just bitter for Dongmei

166
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,401
I put that mountain yesterday

167
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,081
Gave it to my brother-in-law Shen Que

168
00:07:38,641 --> 00:07:39,680
You have to save her

169
00:07:40,201 --> 00:07:41,521
Gotta go find him

170
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,521
From the Yao Mansion six months ago

171
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:58,881
There are as many as seven houses that harbor night walkers

172
00:07:59,081 --> 00:08:00,441
It's hard to catch someone alive this time

173
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,240
Give up two little bosses of the Night Walkers

174
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:03,680
Two brothers Shen Tu Long Shen Tu Hu

175
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:07,321
Yao Xiaozhi said that night walkers were loyal to the Queen Mother

176
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:10,281
Does the general think there's something wrong

177
00:08:13,281 --> 00:08:15,081
By the power of the Queen Mother alone

178
00:08:15,641 --> 00:08:17,401
Can cultivate so many night walkers

179
00:08:18,281 --> 00:08:20,680
The general is suspicious of the prime minister

180
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:22,641
Your Majesty has just ascended the throne and the situation is unstable

181
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:25,120
There is no ironclad evidence and complete certainty

182
00:08:25,321 --> 00:08:26,240
Do not act rashly

183
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,281
The subordinates understand

184
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:28,881
General, there's something else

185
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:30,240
Qin Sizhe gave it to you two days ago

186
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,881
All right

187
00:08:31,321 --> 00:08:32,920
You don't have to tell me about him

188
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:50,921
Shen

189
00:08:51,921 --> 00:08:52,681
General Shen

190
00:08:54,081 --> 00:08:54,880
What did you call me

191
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:58,801
General Shen

192
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:01,880
What do you want from me

193
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,681
I would like to ask you to release the winter plum

194
00:09:05,961 --> 00:09:06,880
She broke the law

195
00:09:07,721 --> 00:09:08,600
Why should I let her go

196
00:09:10,721 --> 00:09:11,921
I know that by law

197
00:09:11,921 --> 00:09:13,561
I have to pay back the mountain master a thousand taels of silver

198
00:09:13,961 --> 00:09:15,280
But Dongmei is weak

199
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,441
I'm afraid she won't stand it

200
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:18,441
Can you just let her out first

201
00:09:18,441 --> 00:09:19,480
I'll pay back the money slowly

202
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,760
What do you have to do with me

203
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,041
I hope the general will remember the past affection

204
00:09:29,161 --> 00:09:30,801
What kind of relationship was there between you and me

205
00:09:31,841 --> 00:09:34,760
Then you and Dongmei are old acquaintances

206
00:09:36,721 --> 00:09:38,000
The law does not tolerate mercy

207
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,201
Jiang Song

208
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:41,600
Don't think you came over to pretend to be pitiful

209
00:09:42,321 --> 00:09:43,801
I'm gonna break the rules for you

210
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:49,240
But I can only find you

211
00:09:50,441 --> 00:09:51,480
You can ask the government

212
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:52,760
Find the mountain master

213
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,120
Why did you come to me

214
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,280
But aren't you the mountain

215
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:56,921
Aren't you

216
00:09:56,921 --> 00:09:58,520
Because I used to like you

217
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,161
You chose to leave

218
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,480
You and I are strangers

219
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:03,961
You should have heard that too

220
00:10:04,161 --> 00:10:05,480
I'm getting married soon

221
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:12,760
Or do you want to come and be my concubine

222
00:10:19,081 --> 00:10:19,961
Forget it

223
00:10:20,441 --> 00:10:21,360
I'm not like you

224
00:10:21,561 --> 00:10:22,880
Can't learn to go all day and night

225
00:10:24,801 --> 00:10:25,600
Shen Que

226
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,600
You know this guy

227
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,760
Not important

228
00:10:36,201 --> 00:10:37,760
Is she that Jiang Song

229
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:43,000
I've seen a lot of women like you

230
00:10:43,321 --> 00:10:44,961
Red eyes with tears

231
00:10:45,161 --> 00:10:46,561
Inspire a man's affection

232
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:48,360
Talk about yourself

233
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:51,760
In fact, everything depends on men

234
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
Qin Niangzi

235
00:10:54,081 --> 00:10:56,161
Please watch your words

236
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:57,441
Don't call me lady

237
00:10:58,041 --> 00:10:59,161
I'm a soldier

238
00:11:00,921 --> 00:11:02,961
I'm not like women like you

239
00:11:03,441 --> 00:11:04,520
I immediately cut my knife

240
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:05,400
Pleasant battlefield

241
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,561
Unlike you guys

242
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:09,841
I starved myself out of human shape for my small waist

243
00:11:09,961 --> 00:11:11,000
Affectionate

244
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,921
Squirm

245
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:12,841
Qin Niangzi

246
00:11:13,081 --> 00:11:14,120
Women in this world

247
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,921
Not everyone is as lucky as you

248
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,721
What kind of life do they lead

249
00:11:17,721 --> 00:11:19,480
They didn't choose it

250
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,961
Why be so harsh

251
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:22,880
Whether it's free and easy

252
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:24,120
Wen Jing Nei Xiu

253
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,561
Sentimental or even aggressive and jealous

254
00:11:26,961 --> 00:11:28,841
Who rules what a woman should be like

255
00:11:29,321 --> 00:11:31,000
I don't think there's any difference

256
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,480
Say so much

257
00:11:33,041 --> 00:11:33,961
Have you never leaned on a man

258
00:11:33,961 --> 00:11:34,760
I leaned over

259
00:11:35,201 --> 00:11:36,520
Not only did I lean over

260
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,561
If necessary in the future

261
00:11:37,561 --> 00:11:38,760
I will still rely on

262
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:39,681
Well, that's all right

263
00:11:39,681 --> 00:11:40,921
Haven't you leaned

264
00:11:41,561 --> 00:11:44,360
Don't you rely on the help of your comrades when you kill the enemy on the battlefield

265
00:11:44,561 --> 00:11:45,681
I'm not like you

266
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:47,041
I don't see any difference

267
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,561
People should help each other

268
00:11:49,561 --> 00:11:50,760
It doesn't matter whether he's a man or a woman

269
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:53,600
There are not many roads left for us in this world

270
00:11:53,841 --> 00:11:56,760
It's a fool if you don't go there

271
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,760
Tooth sharp mouth

272
00:12:07,520 --> 00:12:08,240
Let's go

273
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:18,161
Be quick for a moment

274
00:12:19,561 --> 00:12:21,081
Where can I find a thousand taels

275
00:12:25,681 --> 00:12:26,480
Come over

276
00:12:40,681 --> 00:12:41,400
Say things

277
00:12:42,321 --> 00:12:43,681
The end of the world is coming

278
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:46,520
You're still in the mood to save a little character

279
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:47,760
So what

280
00:12:48,721 --> 00:12:50,321
As long as life goes on

281
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:52,640
I wouldn't give up every moment

282
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,961
I have a way to rescue Dongmei effortlessly

283
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:00,681
Do you want to try

284
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:02,921
What's the way

285
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:04,880
Your hands

286
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,681
Isn't there a novel that Jiang Jiaojiao left you

287
00:13:19,801 --> 00:13:20,961
Apply for tomorrow

288
00:13:21,681 --> 00:13:24,561
Qin Sizhe will tie Jiang Jiaojiao at Guanyin Bridge

289
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:27,000
Shen Tu Long given to the black market

290
00:13:32,561 --> 00:13:33,441
Listen to me

291
00:13:34,921 --> 00:13:36,081
Old rules

292
00:13:37,441 --> 00:13:38,880
Someone who wants to fight me

293
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:40,321
Lost

294
00:13:40,961 --> 00:13:42,760
Compensate me for such a big piece of gold

295
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,681
Won

296
00:13:45,841 --> 00:13:46,880
The gold is yours

297
00:13:47,721 --> 00:13:48,801
This meat ticket

298
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:50,480
It's yours too

299
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,600
The Shentu brothers used the tied meat tickets as bait

300
00:13:56,841 --> 00:13:58,000
Let others challenge

301
00:13:58,441 --> 00:13:59,360
Victory in many battles

302
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,520
I don't know how much money I won

303
00:14:01,721 --> 00:14:04,201
Master Chu, are you interested

304
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:08,120
Chu is not a troubled person

305
00:14:08,681 --> 00:14:12,201
Today's meat ticket is a good treasure

306
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,280
Look at it

307
00:14:23,161 --> 00:14:24,681
Such a pretty little beauty

308
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:29,280
Why is there no one to save me

309
00:14:32,441 --> 00:14:33,240
I'll do it

310
00:14:34,280 --> 00:14:39,240
OK OK

311
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,721
Who is this Chu Muzhi?

312
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:45,201
The other suitor of the heroine

313
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:47,721
Heir to the world's number one money house

314
00:14:48,561 --> 00:14:49,240
look

315
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:51,400
How nice it is to be Jiang Jiaojiao

316
00:14:53,921 --> 00:14:54,921
How do I do this

317
00:14:55,721 --> 00:14:56,880
Go to Guanyin Bridge and wait

318
00:14:57,520 --> 00:15:00,681
Everything will naturally go as the story is written

319
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,921
Do you have any other options

320
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:08,360
One thousand taels

321
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,441
You've never seen so much money in your life, have you

322
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:15,400
Since Shen Que and Cui You'an can't rely on it

323
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,161
It's hard to have a new backer

324
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:19,721
Don't catch it quickly

325
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:26,841
Didn't you just say it's not shameful to rely on men

326
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,400
What are you still hesitating

327
00:15:37,681 --> 00:15:40,721
Will that Qin Sizhe really show up

328
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,600
Isn't this the bitch
