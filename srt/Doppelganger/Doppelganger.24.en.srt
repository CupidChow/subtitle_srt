1
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:51,760
Qiqi was exposed

2
00:00:53,839 --> 00:00:55,080
The night walkers are in place

3
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,360
She's useless

4
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:58,199
But she knows everything

5
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,400
Don't worry

6
00:01:00,080 --> 00:01:01,239
You are destiny

7
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:03,080
No one can stop you

8
00:01:03,839 --> 00:01:05,479
What kind of destiny do you think I believe

9
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:07,239
Of course you have to believe

10
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,040
Looks like Shen Que's men are here

11
00:01:11,639 --> 00:01:12,559
It's quite fast

12
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:21,680
Where are people

13
00:01:21,919 --> 00:01:22,400
no

14
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:29,040
We tried seven seven for a long time

15
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,199
She won't say a word

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,839
Today she suddenly offered to see you

17
00:01:35,839 --> 00:01:36,479
Be careful

18
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,479
Now that the wife has arrived

19
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:05,839
Something I can say

20
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,639
General Shen, let's listen to it too

21
00:02:17,399 --> 00:02:18,359
Actually, Sadato

22
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:22,479
Seven seven

23
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:25,519
Seven seven

24
00:02:25,880 --> 00:02:26,399
Seven seven

25
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,359
Seven seven

26
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,639
Seven seven

27
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:31,840
Seven seven

28
00:02:32,399 --> 00:02:33,040
a form of address for one's wife

29
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:36,280
I'm sorry

30
00:02:36,519 --> 00:02:38,280
Find a doctor, find a doctor quickly

31
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:40,720
It's not necessary

32
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,199
When I killed Dongmei

33
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:46,919
I don't plan to live

34
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:47,760
a form of address for one's wife

35
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,440
Don't talk

36
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,320
Niang Niang Niang

37
00:02:50,919 --> 00:02:56,799
Fortunately I saw my wife for the last time

38
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,479
Seven seven

39
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:03,040
Qiqi is wrong

40
00:03:04,799 --> 00:03:08,959
If the lady has an afterlife

41
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,399
We

42
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:15,479
Let's

43
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:30,720
Seven seven

44
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:33,199
Seven seven

45
00:03:35,799 --> 00:03:36,679
Qiqi, wake up

46
00:03:38,079 --> 00:03:39,199
You wake me up

47
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,840
Are you lying to me again

48
00:03:43,239 --> 00:03:44,600
Didn't you have something to tell me

49
00:03:45,359 --> 00:03:46,199
You say it

50
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,000
Seven seven

51
00:03:51,479 --> 00:03:52,079
Seven seven

52
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:54,959
Qiqi, wake up

53
00:03:57,359 --> 00:03:58,120
You wake up

54
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,600
You wake up

55
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:03,959
Seven seven

56
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,040
I forgive you

57
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,040
I forgive you

58
00:04:09,399 --> 00:04:10,440
I forgive you

59
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,760
Wake up, don't leave me

60
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:13,880
Seven seven

61
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,320
Seven seven

62
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Seven seven

63
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:31,519
I forgive you

64
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,839
a form of address for one's wife

65
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:35,920
Qiqi is ashamed of you

66
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:39,320
I knew that time was running out, so I left this letter

67
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,760
The Night Walker was formed by the Prime Minister's Mansion

68
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,399
The first prince was framed for investigating night walkers

69
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,760
The whereabouts of the Cloud Chung Order caused by the Prince's case are unknown

70
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,760
Now the Prime Minister is preparing to rise in the Yuan Dynasty

71
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:54,599
Be sure to find the Yunyong Order before they do

72
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:07,680
Thanks to Prime Minister Cui for providing shelter

73
00:05:08,039 --> 00:05:09,959
The Lantern Festival will be in three days

74
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:11,399
Didn't Sadato say

75
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:13,519
Can you help me find the cloud surge order

76
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:17,680
Don't worry, the cloud order will appear soon

77
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:19,199
Quod God

78
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:21,079
Is on your side

79
00:05:34,279 --> 00:05:36,240
Sister, stop crying

80
00:05:44,279 --> 00:05:44,959
Thank you

81
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,399
You're welcome

82
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:49,240
That brother gave it to me

83
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,039
This is for Cicada Mother

84
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:08,959
You said

85
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,440
The river lanterns will float to the dead

86
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:21,680
You put one too

87
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,159
Do you remember

88
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,519
What you said

89
00:06:27,839 --> 00:06:28,639
I remember it all

90
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,399
There's something I have to make clear to you

91
00:06:39,079 --> 00:06:39,639
what

92
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,760
Sadato wants to manipulate me

93
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,599
Let me be Jiang Jiaojiao

94
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:47,360
I can't help but be close to you

95
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,959
Because Jiang Jiaojiao once loved you

96
00:06:50,719 --> 00:06:51,440
Not me

97
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,079
If I go out of line again

98
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:57,000
Please don't confuse

99
00:06:57,920 --> 00:06:59,120
That's not my heart

100
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:03,360
I'll try my best to avoid you

101
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:10,959
Why

102
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,440
what

103
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,680
Why is your affection for me false

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,120
Because it was a mistake

105
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:23,519
I'm Jiang Song

106
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,000
The person I love is

107
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,320
My life is ridiculous

108
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:26,920
You love Shen Che

109
00:07:26,920 --> 00:07:27,399
Love all beings

110
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:28,240
Love the world

111
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,199
Why can't you love one more me

112
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:36,959
Do you know

113
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:39,399
Only you are by my side

114
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:41,880
I don't feel like an empty shell

115
00:07:50,399 --> 00:07:51,360
I can't save you

116
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:06,880
Come on, madam

117
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,320
You just pulp out of this piggy bank

118
00:08:10,719 --> 00:08:11,560
So this money

119
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:13,000
It won't appear out of thin air

120
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,199
3 days later

121
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,039
Will this world really disappear

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,839
Pixiu

123
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,000
I'm small

124
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:35,880
Can't be with that god

125
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,719
Counterbalance

126
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:41,519
I'll take everyone back to Jiang's house

127
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,880
I thought I was in a safe haven

128
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,559
But the world is about to fall

129
00:08:47,559 --> 00:08:48,720
There's nowhere to run

130
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:54,159
Do I really have to escape this world alone

131
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:56,159
But I escaped

132
00:08:58,480 --> 00:08:59,319
Not me anymore

133
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,200
It's about to dawn

134
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,120
There's no time to hesitate

135
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,639
Then leave no regrets

136
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,399
How's it going from the Prime Minister's Mansion

137
00:09:24,559 --> 00:09:25,200
Spy came to report

138
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,840
The Prime Minister stayed in a side room all day

139
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:29,559
Keep an eye on

140
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,360
Not a bird can fly into the Prime Minister's Mansion

141
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,039
understand

142
00:09:32,159 --> 00:09:33,120
The people captured by the Zhenren Mansion

143
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,360
Still refuse to tell the whereabouts of Sadara

144
00:09:35,319 --> 00:09:37,039
Tell me where did the virgin go

145
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,559
Go down

146
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:40,639
Yes

147
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:44,279
Where's Sadato

148
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,600
Stop talking nonsense

149
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,519
three

150
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:58,159
two

151
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,439
one

152
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:02,600
The general can't kill him

153
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:04,039
Shen Que

154
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:06,360
Shen Que

155
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,000
These are the flowers I wrapped specially for you

156
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,080
Send you

157
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,439
It was Miaohua who let you in

158
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,760
This is not where you should be

159
00:11:16,319 --> 00:11:17,240
What are you trying to do

160
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,000
Can't you see

161
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:20,960
What do you see

162
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,080
I am proposing to you

163
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:30,080
Shen Que

164
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,240
Is it fun to tease me

165
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,279
I'm not playing tricks on you

166
00:11:42,919 --> 00:11:43,480
That's enough

167
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:44,679
Jiang Song

168
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:46,600
That's enough

169
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:05,720
I can't save you

170
00:13:10,439 --> 00:13:12,319
She'll come to you tonight

171
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,080
Let her be yours

172
00:13:18,039 --> 00:13:19,840
Then let's start all over again

173
00:13:39,399 --> 00:13:40,360
Why did I come here

174
00:13:45,319 --> 00:13:46,000
I want to go home

175
00:13:58,399 --> 00:14:00,399
Why can't I remember my way home

176
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:07,399
Jiang Niangzi

177
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,760
Jiang Niangzi

178
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,000
I'll take you out

179
00:14:32,919 --> 00:14:34,319
This is Jiang Jiaojiao's memory

180
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:35,840
Not mine

181
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:00,639
Choi You-an

182
00:15:13,039 --> 00:15:13,760
What do you do

183
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,000
Shen Que

184
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:19,279
Come with me

185
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,319
What did you bring me here for

186
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:57,799
I want to calm myself down for a while

187
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:07,880
Shen Que

188
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,760
I want to talk to you

189
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:22,439
Okay, what about

190
00:16:26,679 --> 00:16:28,120
If someone wants to manipulate me

191
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:30,360
What should I do

192
00:16:31,559 --> 00:16:32,600
Who dares to manipulate you

193
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,439
If the world ends in three days

194
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:48,120
Would you like to meet the end with me

195
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:49,840
What are you talking about

196
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:52,480
Shen Que

197
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,439
I am sorry

198
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,880
I should have told you earlier

199
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,200
I like you

200
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:10,480
Jiang Song, don't fool around

201
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:11,359
I'm not fooling around

202
00:17:13,519 --> 00:17:14,519
I like you

203
00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,519
I only liked you

204
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:31,599
What are you afraid of

205
00:17:33,839 --> 00:17:36,000
If you knew what I had done

206
00:17:37,519 --> 00:17:38,440
I won't say I like it

207
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,160
I know

208
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:41,599
Do you really know

209
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:42,400
I know

210
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,760
Shen Que

211
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,839
You've worked hard all the way

212
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,119
After Shangyuan

213
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,519
I don't know what to expect

214
00:17:58,319 --> 00:17:58,720
In case I

215
00:17:58,720 --> 00:17:59,960
No matter what happens

216
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:03,559
Now that I have chosen

217
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,400
You won't regret it

218
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,039
I don't deserve it

219
00:19:09,879 --> 00:19:11,279
What did she do

220
00:19:11,680 --> 00:19:13,200
The crack is getting bigger and bigger

221
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:16,839
Jiang Song, don't blame me for being ruthless
