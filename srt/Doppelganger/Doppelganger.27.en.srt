1
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,479
Jiang Song

2
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,199
I said I wanted to call people by their nicknames

3
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:14,279
Called Jiaojiao

4
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:46,320
Aniang

5
00:01:47,839 --> 00:01:48,919
This is my new poem

6
00:01:48,919 --> 00:01:49,800
Let me see

7
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Well written

8
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:54,919
Our Dabao can write poetry at the age of three

9
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:55,880
Then you say

10
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:57,719
Should my mother give it to my father

11
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:59,279
Have two treasures and three treasures

12
00:02:01,279 --> 00:02:03,199
To reward you with ice cream

13
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:05,520
Well written

14
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:06,999
Jiaojiao

15
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,559
dad

16
00:02:16,199 --> 00:02:16,840
go

17
00:02:24,359 --> 00:02:25,519
I'm Jiang Jiaojiao

18
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,359
My husband dotes on me

19
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:28,799
Three years of hugging

20
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:39,519
Sister, you eat

21
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,040
Thank you brother

22
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,079
My mother also dotes on me

23
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,160
Everywhere you go, you are the focus of attention

24
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,239
The only drawback is that

25
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,799
I've heard from time to time over the years

26
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:19,320
The sound of a heart beating from nowhere

27
00:03:19,679 --> 00:03:25,399
Familiar and strange, near and far away

28
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:29,919
What's wrong Jiaojiao

29
00:03:31,479 --> 00:03:32,359
It's okay

30
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,760
It doesn't matter if I don't listen to it

31
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,880
I can spend my life with you

32
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:58,079
I am very happy

33
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,240
It's noisy

34
00:04:28,199 --> 00:04:32,079
I want to see where the heartbeat came from today

35
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:45,800
Where is this a little familiar

36
00:05:56,719 --> 00:05:57,760
This is delicious too

37
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:06,120
You're here. We've been waiting for you

38
00:06:06,959 --> 00:06:08,279
Who are you

39
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,240
It doesn't matter who we are

40
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,800
Importantly

41
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,599
Who are you

42
00:07:01,279 --> 00:07:02,920
You'll catch your moon

43
00:07:04,199 --> 00:07:06,079
Who's talking

44
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:37,920
Good

45
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,000
This is too amazing

46
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:42,120
OK OK

47
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,760
Awesome, awesome, really awesome

48
00:07:44,039 --> 00:07:45,399
A heroine

49
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,760
Good, too strong

50
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:47,560
Good

51
00:07:48,599 --> 00:07:50,320
So awesome

52
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,560
Awesome good

53
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:53,519
Amazing

54
00:07:53,959 --> 00:07:55,639
It's amazing, it's good

55
00:07:55,959 --> 00:07:58,079
So wonderful and awesome

56
00:07:58,079 --> 00:08:00,480
OK OK

57
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,519
Do you remember

58
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,399
Who are you

59
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:06,560
Who am I

60
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:13,240
I'm Jiang Jiaojiao

61
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,519
No, who are you

62
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,120
I am

63
00:08:22,599 --> 00:08:23,560
I am

64
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,480
Who am I

65
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:27,719
I am

66
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,039
I am

67
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:38,599
Jiang Song

68
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:39,600
Jiang Song

69
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,240
My name is Jiang Song

70
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,559
Jiang Song

71
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:46,799
I'm Jiang Song

72
00:08:47,039 --> 00:08:49,679
Well, well, awesome

73
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:51,279
So amazing

74
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:52,799
fierce

75
00:08:52,799 --> 00:08:54,639
A little butterfly

76
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:55,319
I'm back

77
00:08:55,319 --> 00:08:56,080
Today we made

78
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,480
Fly over Guanyin Bridge

79
00:08:57,480 --> 00:08:58,439
Ten dollars

80
00:08:59,159 --> 00:09:00,039
Ma'am, look

81
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,319
I'm going back to my world

82
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:02,039
Will you join me

83
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,399
Your butterfly embroidery is crooked

84
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,679
Fairy Sister

85
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,880
a form of address for one's wife

86
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,919
Jiang Song

87
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,159
What's going on

88
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,279
Could it be that everything just now

89
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,439
It's just a dream

90
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,960
You did it

91
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:41,000
Jiaojiao

92
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,240
dad

93
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,600
You're not my father

94
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:51,799
I am not Jiang Jiaojiao either

95
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,639
Your father died ten years ago

96
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:56,679
Then who are you

97
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:59,279
I am the God who created this world

98
00:10:05,399 --> 00:10:07,120
He is also an ordinary father

99
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:10,200
Let me tell you a story

100
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,679
I had a happy family

101
00:10:14,439 --> 00:10:15,840
Both children

102
00:10:16,439 --> 00:10:20,519
My daughter Jiaojiao was originally very obedient and obedient

103
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:24,919
But then she met bad friends

104
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,200
Little Things in Life

105
00:10:27,439 --> 00:10:29,360
Can make her lose control and collapse

106
00:10:32,120 --> 00:10:33,720
But she didn't say anything

107
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,000
And started complaining about me and her mother

108
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
Love your brother but not her

109
00:10:37,799 --> 00:10:38,519
Jiaojiao

110
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,240
Sister, where are you going

111
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:46,799
in the end

112
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,880
The child is too bad to bear it

113
00:10:54,960 --> 00:10:57,559
I love her and I want to protect her

114
00:10:58,039 --> 00:11:01,120
So I followed Jiaojiao's preferences

115
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,559
Created this virtual world

116
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,919
Uploaded her consciousness

117
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,760
Let Jiaojiao become the heroine of her own book

118
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:12,319
Enjoy happiness

119
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:14,840
In order to make all the plot

120
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:16,639
Must follow the development of the novel

121
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:20,240
I made the runaway bride a virgin

122
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:23,159
Let her supervise the world for me

123
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:26,360
I just didn't expect you

124
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:29,720
She actually forced Jiaojiao to escape from the city

125
00:11:32,319 --> 00:11:35,360
At first I wanted to tempt you by going to the real world

126
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:38,559
Let you become a container of Jiaojiao consciousness

127
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,919
But you're too self-conscious

128
00:11:41,679 --> 00:11:43,600
Why on earth do you insist

129
00:11:44,039 --> 00:11:44,760
You

130
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:46,439
Zhen Ren

131
00:11:47,159 --> 00:11:48,159
Jiang Jiaojiao

132
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,399
All told me I was a fake

133
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:53,200
The world is fake

134
00:11:54,039 --> 00:11:55,480
You treat me like a paper man

135
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:56,880
Look at me struggling

136
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:57,960
But

137
00:11:59,039 --> 00:11:59,760
How do you know

138
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,679
You and Jiang Jiaojiao are not paper people written by anyone

139
00:12:03,319 --> 00:12:06,600
Who can tell that my world is fake

140
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,360
Your world is real

141
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:10,919
Do you

142
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:18,159
But does your perspective represent truth

143
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,480
There is no absolute reality

144
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,319
I am real when I live in the present

145
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,679
One thought is born

146
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:27,519
That is, I save

147
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,679
Gibberish

148
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:31,240
This is the safe haven I built for Jiaojiao

149
00:12:31,399 --> 00:12:33,159
It's you who occupy the magpie's nest

150
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:35,519
You're just moving yourself

151
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,439
Have you ever asked Jiang Jiaojiao

152
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,120
What exactly does she want

153
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,559
What do you know

154
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,919
Being a parent

155
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:44,240
Plan for the long term

156
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:46,039
Jiaojiao, she's still young

157
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,360
She doesn't know what she wants

158
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,960
I'm protecting her

159
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,679
What you call protection is control

160
00:12:52,919 --> 00:12:54,679
Oppressive tame

161
00:12:58,919 --> 00:13:02,039
I finally know why Jiang Jiaojiao is like this

162
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:05,039
She's so pitiful

163
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:07,080
Shut up, who are you

164
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,279
How dare you question me

165
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,679
My patience is exhausted

166
00:13:10,960 --> 00:13:13,159
I'd rather destroy this virtual world

167
00:13:13,279 --> 00:13:15,240
I want to kill you dummy too

168
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:18,519
Call the doctor

169
00:13:18,919 --> 00:13:20,039
The patient seems dying

170
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:41,200
It's time to exercise

171
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,319
uncle
