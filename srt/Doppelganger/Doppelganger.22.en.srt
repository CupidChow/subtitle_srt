1
00:00:48,560 --> 00:00:49,081
Jiang Song

2
00:00:51,240 --> 00:00:52,321
What are you doing here again

3
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,520
Here you go

4
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:54,641
What is this

5
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:56,840
Open it and see

6
00:01:07,321 --> 00:01:08,120
What do you mean

7
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:10,281
As a reward for saving me

8
00:01:12,401 --> 00:01:15,200
It doesn't look like you're thanking me

9
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,521
You leave it alone

10
00:01:17,881 --> 00:01:19,840
How did you get the injury on your face

11
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:21,241
I said you leave it alone

12
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,560
The rain has stopped

13
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,041
I'll hit

14
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,521
I already gave her the money

15
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:52,761
frost

16
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:55,840
After all, I am the legitimate son of Duke Zhen

17
00:01:56,360 --> 00:01:57,560
And your brother

18
00:01:57,881 --> 00:01:59,200
Why do you always

19
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,360
Slap me in the face

20
00:02:05,761 --> 00:02:06,761
Next time

21
00:02:07,881 --> 00:02:09,080
Change places

22
00:02:13,761 --> 00:02:15,001
So many people

23
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,800
I'm incompetent

24
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,001
Not taking care of the world

25
00:02:42,041 --> 00:02:43,920
I'll get the heroine back to her place as soon as possible

26
00:02:44,601 --> 00:02:46,041
Please send down your strength

27
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:47,960
Tame the unobedient

28
00:03:39,960 --> 00:03:41,200
Seven days left

29
00:03:43,881 --> 00:03:45,321
How could I not be afraid

30
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,360
But if under the fear of extinction

31
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,841
In a panic like an ant

32
00:03:52,601 --> 00:03:54,640
Is it not just as God wished

33
00:04:03,640 --> 00:04:04,601
Don't hide

34
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,920
That is

35
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:08,480
What are you playing

36
00:04:08,841 --> 00:04:10,441
Lady, come along

37
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,680
Careful!

38
00:04:35,361 --> 00:04:37,001
My patience is exhausted

39
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:39,280
You can kill me

40
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:00,600
Shen Que

41
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,881
I won't tell my brother's whereabouts

42
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,321
Father, go

43
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:08,960
dad

44
00:05:09,241 --> 00:05:10,241
Dad, hurry up

45
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,280
dad

46
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,001
Shen Quefather

47
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:14,881
Why don't you even spare a child

48
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:16,001
dad

49
00:05:16,001 --> 00:05:19,040
Dad, help me

50
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:20,321
dad

51
00:05:27,441 --> 00:05:28,840
It's you

52
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,321
Daddy Daddy

53
00:05:33,321 --> 00:05:35,241
If you have any tricks, come at me

54
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:39,441
Dad, help me, Dad

55
00:05:40,441 --> 00:05:41,080
use

56
00:05:41,881 --> 00:05:42,720
Punishment

57
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:45,520
No, no father

58
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,361
I said I said

59
00:05:47,361 --> 00:05:48,080
dad

60
00:05:53,881 --> 00:05:56,040
I really don't know who's behind the Night Walker

61
00:05:57,921 --> 00:05:58,960
But I know

62
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,400
My brother might be hiding somewhere

63
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,801
Take it down, yeah

64
00:06:16,321 --> 00:06:18,200
Don't let dad leave

65
00:06:18,241 --> 00:06:19,960
dad

66
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,361
don't

67
00:06:37,121 --> 00:06:38,481
General, what's wrong with you

68
00:06:41,001 --> 00:06:41,761
Amo

69
00:06:43,441 --> 00:06:44,761
I seem a little tired

70
00:06:45,121 --> 00:06:46,121
I don't blame you just now

71
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:47,921
Are you trying to find out the night walker as soon as possible

72
00:06:47,921 --> 00:06:48,801
Save more people

73
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,481
I don't know

74
00:06:51,681 --> 00:06:52,280
I

75
00:06:54,001 --> 00:06:55,400
General, you've never been like this

76
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,840
How can you feel better

77
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:04,441
Look, look, look

78
00:07:04,441 --> 00:07:06,080
This is the dress we sewed by ourselves

79
00:07:06,361 --> 00:07:07,321
You take it back and wear it

80
00:07:07,321 --> 00:07:08,321
Thank you Thank you

81
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:09,321
Here

82
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:15,280
Here's your thank you

83
00:07:16,921 --> 00:07:18,720
Your crush is really busy

84
00:07:18,921 --> 00:07:19,720
Stop talking nonsense

85
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,481
You think you can hide it well

86
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,321
Actually the way you look at her

87
00:07:24,481 --> 00:07:25,921
Everyone can see it

88
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,481
Go find Shen Tu Long

89
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,681
Curious about your kind of wood

90
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,200
What kind of lady would you like

91
00:07:32,761 --> 00:07:34,600
Tell me what she likes

92
00:07:34,881 --> 00:07:36,321
Thank you

93
00:07:37,001 --> 00:07:37,801
Take it for you

94
00:07:39,441 --> 00:07:40,241
It's my turn

95
00:07:40,441 --> 00:07:41,241
She likes money

96
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,720
Are you perfunctory with me

97
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:44,600
Thank you

98
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:58,921
My lady is really a kind person

99
00:08:00,761 --> 00:08:01,200
give

100
00:08:01,321 --> 00:08:02,561
She likes green drinks

101
00:08:03,441 --> 00:08:04,561
Don't like cheese drinks

102
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:06,881
Like citrus

103
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,040
Don't like pears

104
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,921
Why is it a green drink not a cheese drink? Qiqi

105
00:08:15,481 --> 00:08:16,321
a form of address for one's wife

106
00:08:16,481 --> 00:08:18,280
Don't you never drink cheese

107
00:08:18,361 --> 00:08:19,280
Who said that

108
00:08:19,681 --> 00:08:21,960
Cheese drink, tea and some pearls

109
00:08:22,321 --> 00:08:24,280
Isn't it just fruity bubble tea

110
00:08:24,801 --> 00:08:25,640
a form of address for one's wife

111
00:08:25,881 --> 00:08:27,361
What is bubble tea

112
00:08:28,361 --> 00:08:29,280
Pearl

113
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,600
Can you eat it

114
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,080
Yeah, what is bubble tea

115
00:08:35,881 --> 00:08:37,241
I think I heard it somewhere

116
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,601
It seems that Jiang Jiaojiao said

117
00:08:42,160 --> 00:08:42,841
Seven seven

118
00:08:42,920 --> 00:08:44,400
Help me out

119
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,001
Jiang Niangzi

120
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:54,800
Jiang Niangzi

121
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:59,320
Jiang Niangzi

122
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:03,761
Jiang Niangzi

123
00:09:07,640 --> 00:09:09,841
Jiang Niangzi

124
00:09:12,081 --> 00:09:15,920
Jiang Niangzi

125
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,081
Little lady

126
00:09:30,881 --> 00:09:31,800
Little lady

127
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,560
What's your name

128
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:35,961
Do you want my brother to take you home

129
00:09:35,961 --> 00:09:36,601
My name is

130
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:37,920
My name is

131
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,320
I will protect you

132
00:09:41,001 --> 00:09:41,680
Jiang Song

133
00:09:43,081 --> 00:09:43,881
Shen Que

134
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,121
Jiang Song, what's wrong with you

135
00:10:07,841 --> 00:10:08,920
Cui Yongzi

136
00:10:10,001 --> 00:10:10,761
Jiang Niangzi

137
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,081
Long time no see

138
00:10:12,841 --> 00:10:15,481
Strange shouldn't I get rid of him

139
00:10:16,841 --> 00:10:18,520
Yeah, long time no see

140
00:10:19,361 --> 00:10:20,800
When did you return to Beijing

141
00:10:22,721 --> 00:10:23,481
A few days ago

142
00:10:29,081 --> 00:10:31,361
Lady Jiang has an appointment with General Shen

143
00:10:32,361 --> 00:10:33,201
No

144
00:10:34,961 --> 00:10:35,961
In that case

145
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,160
It's getting late

146
00:10:37,601 --> 00:10:38,881
Why don't I take Lady Jiang home

147
00:10:38,961 --> 00:10:41,440
No, no, no

148
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,320
OK

149
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:48,081
What's wrong with me

150
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,761
Distinguished guests come to the door and are greeted far away

151
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:20,320
Please

152
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,761
General, be careful of cheating

153
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:43,520
The guests arrived

154
00:11:57,721 --> 00:11:58,721
Who is Shen Tu Long

155
00:12:00,241 --> 00:12:01,241
I am

156
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:02,881
Then take them all down

157
00:12:08,121 --> 00:12:08,761
It's illusion

158
00:12:13,361 --> 00:12:14,001
Chase

159
00:12:16,841 --> 00:12:17,481
Venerable

160
00:12:17,841 --> 00:12:19,160
Thanks to the magic incense you gave

161
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,920
The subordinates were able to escape

162
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,081
Seven days later is the Shangyuan Festival

163
00:12:25,001 --> 00:12:27,121
You are being targeted by Shen Que at this time

164
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:29,440
If you destroy the great deal of the Lord

165
00:12:30,241 --> 00:12:31,201
Can you afford it

166
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:32,841
The subordinates die

167
00:12:34,001 --> 00:12:34,881
But my subordinate guarantees

168
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,601
Hu doesn't know anything

169
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:37,881
That's all

170
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,601
You've worked hard too

171
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,920
Take the money to shelter from the limelight

172
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:43,640
Yes

173
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:48,481
be careful

174
00:12:52,680 --> 00:12:53,440
Are you okay

175
00:12:54,841 --> 00:12:57,121
I have become an abandoned son of the Lord

176
00:12:57,721 --> 00:13:00,361
But please spare Ah Hu

177
00:13:01,121 --> 00:13:02,160
Keep Ah Hu

178
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,440
Who is your Lord

179
00:13:03,841 --> 00:13:04,881
Where are the other night walkers

180
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,920
I've never seen the Lord

181
00:13:08,001 --> 00:13:10,841
Night walkers all over the capital

182
00:13:11,881 --> 00:13:13,241
Prepare for the Yuan Ye

183
00:13:14,601 --> 00:13:17,920
Rebellion

184
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:43,081
a form of address for one's wife

185
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:44,001
a form of address for one's wife

186
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,361
What's wrong with you

187
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,280
Seven seven

188
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:50,361
Seven seven

189
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:53,160
I

190
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,961
Something seems wrong with me lately

191
00:13:58,241 --> 00:13:58,920
What's wrong

192
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,961
I feel like I have these days

193
00:14:03,081 --> 00:14:05,160
It seems that I can't control myself

194
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,481
I am becoming less and less like myself

195
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,601
As if there was another soul

196
00:14:10,481 --> 00:14:11,680
Is invading my body

197
00:14:13,560 --> 00:14:14,560
Don't be afraid, lady

198
00:14:15,361 --> 00:14:18,761
Maybe you've been too busy with things lately

199
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,040
This way

200
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,520
Qiqi will accompany you to the yard to relax

201
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,520
Look at the moon

202
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,081
Madam, don't you like watching the moon the most

203
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:28,721
Moon

204
00:14:30,241 --> 00:14:31,081
Look at the moon

205
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:34,040
I'll watch the moon with you from now on

206
00:14:38,841 --> 00:14:39,721
I'm going out

207
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:42,761
Lady, where are you going

208
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,680
I'll watch the moon with you from now on

209
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,160
Who made an appointment with me to see the moon

210
00:15:20,761 --> 00:15:22,601
Why can't I remember his face

211
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:36,961
It's you

212
00:15:39,081 --> 00:15:39,961
Why did you come

213
00:15:41,361 --> 00:15:42,201
Come and enjoy the moon with you

214
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,160
Someone I have an appointment with

215
00:15:48,361 --> 00:15:49,121
It's you

216
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:16,241
Shen Que

217
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,280
You protect him

218
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:21,601
I haven't

219
00:16:26,881 --> 00:16:27,601
I don't have

220
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,721
Shen Que

221
00:16:44,961 --> 00:16:45,761
Don't come over

222
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:51,961
Something's wrong with me lately

223
00:16:53,481 --> 00:16:54,440
But I'm sure

224
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,680
Someone I have an appointment with

225
00:16:57,721 --> 00:16:58,560
Not you

226
00:17:15,080 --> 00:17:15,961
Zhen Ren said

227
00:17:16,360 --> 00:17:18,360
If I come, she's mine

228
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,560
It seems that she is nothing more than that

229
00:17:20,961 --> 00:17:21,800
Rest assured

230
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:25,800
I will make her and Shen Que have a hard time with each other

231
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:27,560
Additionally

232
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:29,520
Brother Shentu, don't worry

233
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:31,921
I won't let Shen Que find out about the prime minister's house

234
00:17:32,761 --> 00:17:34,161
Sadato sent you to help me in secret

235
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,761
Gather night walkers scattered everywhere

236
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,201
What to picture

237
00:17:39,201 --> 00:17:40,840
The virgin is ordered by God Bi

238
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:43,241
Help you achieve great things

239
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,481
What divine destiny

240
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,761
You just coax the deceased emperor

241
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:51,761
Might as well be frank

242
00:17:52,641 --> 00:17:55,441
After all, the Prime Minister's Mansion is now constrained by Shen Que everywhere

243
00:17:56,961 --> 00:17:58,441
You can take the opportunity to increase the price

244
00:17:59,721 --> 00:18:00,560
What do you want

245
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:02,360
Co-governance of mountains and rivers

246
00:18:06,721 --> 00:18:07,641
After it's done

247
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:09,600
The virgin will retire

248
00:18:10,481 --> 00:18:11,481
No cloud surge order

249
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,600
No one can mobilize night walkers

250
00:18:14,481 --> 00:18:15,241
Rest assured

251
00:18:15,721 --> 00:18:18,761
Zhenren can find Yunyong Ling
