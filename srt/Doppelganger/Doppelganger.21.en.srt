1
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:55,721
What kind of man is he really

2
00:01:01,001 --> 00:01:01,760
I don't know

3
00:01:03,880 --> 00:01:04,840
What should I believe

4
00:01:12,121 --> 00:01:13,800
This is Shen Que's true face

5
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:17,960
Do you think your words are believable

6
00:01:18,761 --> 00:01:20,361
Why don't you open your book

7
00:01:20,841 --> 00:01:22,921
To see Shen Que's future and past

8
00:01:23,561 --> 00:01:24,201
Not required

9
00:01:35,401 --> 00:01:36,160
What's going on

10
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,201
This is the world of books

11
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:40,281
Now there is no heroine

12
00:01:40,721 --> 00:01:41,680
You burned the book again

13
00:01:42,281 --> 00:01:43,721
Just burn the world

14
00:01:50,761 --> 00:01:51,481
Where is this

15
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:54,001
You're in the last chapter of the story

16
00:01:54,841 --> 00:01:55,800
The near future

17
00:02:09,201 --> 00:02:09,921
Your Majesty

18
00:02:16,841 --> 00:02:18,001
I gouged out his eyes

19
00:02:20,001 --> 00:02:20,961
Shen Que

20
00:02:22,001 --> 00:02:22,600
Why

21
00:02:24,081 --> 00:02:26,521
Didn't you say you'd never see me

22
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,600
What are you doing here

23
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,480
Shen Que

24
00:02:31,561 --> 00:02:32,600
Why would you do this

25
00:02:34,281 --> 00:02:35,920
Just killed a few people

26
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,121
How many did you kill

27
00:02:40,281 --> 00:02:41,241
I don't remember either

28
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,241
Anyway they say

29
00:02:46,081 --> 00:02:48,001
Water in the moat

30
00:02:48,721 --> 00:02:49,880
It's all dyed red

31
00:02:52,561 --> 00:02:53,241
don't

32
00:03:01,841 --> 00:03:03,241
Even if you kill me

33
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,001
I'm still the Queen Mother

34
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:08,281
This country is still the country of the Zhao family

35
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:09,721
General

36
00:03:10,081 --> 00:03:11,961
How many people do you have to kill to be a general

37
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,160
General

38
00:03:13,721 --> 00:03:15,521
Amo can't accompany you on this road

39
00:03:15,961 --> 00:03:18,320
General Shen please spare my family

40
00:03:18,401 --> 00:03:20,001
They're innocent

41
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,480
Kill him

42
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:25,040
End this evil barrier

43
00:03:33,801 --> 00:03:34,801
In your heart

44
00:03:36,001 --> 00:03:38,600
Haven't I always been a bloodthirsty monster

45
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,561
No, no

46
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:43,801
Shen Que

47
00:03:50,241 --> 00:03:52,200
Welcome to my world

48
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,360
Ginger

49
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,440
ode

50
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:01,561
The hypocrisy set

51
00:04:01,561 --> 00:04:02,760
Doesn't work for me anymore

52
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
But why

53
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,801
Why couldn't you come for me once

54
00:04:10,961 --> 00:04:12,121
I am a wicked man

55
00:04:12,961 --> 00:04:14,200
I have a bad past

56
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:16,961
So I don't deserve it

57
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,880
You see

58
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:23,800
If Shen is indeed immortal

59
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:25,961
He will kill innocent people like this

60
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,201
Kill him

61
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:28,721
Kill him

62
00:04:28,721 --> 00:04:29,521
I don't

63
00:04:30,841 --> 00:04:32,240
Just a future that doesn't know whether it is true or false

64
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,321
Go to trial

65
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:37,521
Is it fair to execute a man

66
00:04:38,441 --> 00:04:39,761
This is not justice

67
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:41,401
This is hypocrisy

68
00:04:43,881 --> 00:04:44,600
Good

69
00:04:45,841 --> 00:04:47,160
Then I'll show you again

70
00:04:48,081 --> 00:04:49,920
The evil he has committed

71
00:05:23,321 --> 00:05:26,441
Abba told me to wait here

72
00:05:26,641 --> 00:05:30,521
Said a hero would come and take me away

73
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,961
Are there any Hu people in Shen Que

74
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,201
no

75
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:55,480
It's you

76
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,721
Hide well

77
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:29,040
What a good time to kill today

78
00:06:30,201 --> 00:06:31,081
General Zhang has an order

79
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:32,560
Celebration dinner tonight

80
00:06:33,081 --> 00:06:33,841
Enough drinks

81
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,680
Good

82
00:06:37,521 --> 00:06:38,081
Shen Que

83
00:06:38,401 --> 00:06:39,401
Let's go and drink

84
00:06:39,401 --> 00:06:40,600
Walk walk walk

85
00:06:50,721 --> 00:06:51,321
Come on

86
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:53,120
Walk walk walk

87
00:06:54,641 --> 00:06:56,160
We guard the frontier

88
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:58,401
So many Hu people died at your hands

89
00:06:59,040 --> 00:07:00,841
I don't know how many children have no way to live

90
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:04,360
Do you think they died because they deserved to die

91
00:07:04,761 --> 00:07:06,401
That's because we're gonna live

92
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,920
Shen Que, please wake up

93
00:07:09,641 --> 00:07:10,721
Entered this Asura field

94
00:07:11,521 --> 00:07:12,841
Still thinking about being a good person

95
00:07:15,081 --> 00:07:16,281
Brothers, go

96
00:07:16,641 --> 00:07:17,321
Go to drink

97
00:07:17,641 --> 00:07:18,800
OK OK

98
00:07:18,961 --> 00:07:19,401
Good

99
00:07:19,721 --> 00:07:20,160
Good

100
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,360
It's me

101
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:35,521
I killed him

102
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,240
they

103
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,081
See it

104
00:07:50,600 --> 00:07:51,641
He killed so many people

105
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:52,600
Even children

106
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:54,281
Don't you deserve to die

107
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:55,881
Run

108
00:07:57,201 --> 00:07:57,841
Run

109
00:07:57,961 --> 00:07:58,881
Where to go

110
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,120
Run to the beginning of the story

111
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,641
To confirm the most vulnerable moment in the past

112
00:08:06,201 --> 00:08:07,281
Kill him

113
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
Run

114
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,560
After Lady Jiang left

115
00:08:33,081 --> 00:08:34,360
The general looked for her like a madman

116
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:37,721
Even those who have lost their soul are not like him anymore

117
00:08:38,441 --> 00:08:40,240
Jiang Niangzi is angry that General killed the Yao family

118
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,640
If the general has some difficulties

119
00:08:43,041 --> 00:08:44,280
Why don't you explain it to her

120
00:08:44,841 --> 00:08:46,240
The secret orders of the court are of great importance

121
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,880
How can the general just reveal it

122
00:08:48,441 --> 00:08:50,081
What's more, Lady Jiang knows

123
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,360
Instead, it ignites the upper body

124
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:23,041
You're back

125
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,321
This time

126
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,801
Will it be another five years

127
00:09:31,681 --> 00:09:33,000
You're willing to see me

128
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:35,760
Quick

129
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:37,480
Do it quickly

130
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,161
Before he's awake

131
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:41,480
Kill him now

132
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:15,120
Let's see if there is anyone alive

133
00:10:16,321 --> 00:10:16,961
Keep an eye on

134
00:10:33,201 --> 00:10:33,921
Shen Que

135
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:55,520
Shen Que

136
00:10:57,041 --> 00:10:58,041
Hang in there

137
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,681
You came to kill him, not to save him

138
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:07,961
He's waking up

139
00:11:08,081 --> 00:11:09,961
Kill him quickly

140
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,961
You're dying

141
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:44,280
This is your last chance

142
00:11:45,681 --> 00:11:47,400
You nearly blinded that kid

143
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:48,921
How can we get a good price

144
00:11:49,801 --> 00:11:51,081
Don't worry, I know

145
00:11:51,441 --> 00:11:52,280
It will be fine in two days

146
00:12:01,321 --> 00:12:02,000
Shen Que

147
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:03,360
Don't you hit me

148
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,760
Don't hit me, I'm afraid

149
00:12:07,041 --> 00:12:09,240
Don't be afraid Don't be afraid

150
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:12,801
Shen Que, I won't hurt you

151
00:12:13,561 --> 00:12:14,880
Who are you

152
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,640
I'm here for you

153
00:12:18,441 --> 00:12:19,360
Guardian fairy

154
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,600
Fairy

155
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,360
Then can you help me fulfill a wish

156
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,801
What wish do you want

157
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,921
I can't see anything

158
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,801
It's so dark I'm so scared

159
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,120
Can you make me less scared

160
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,120
Shen Que

161
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:49,480
Here is the butterfly bell I made

162
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:51,240
If you're afraid later

163
00:12:52,201 --> 00:12:54,961
Listen to its sound and it's not so scary

164
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:04,841
What's wrong

165
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:06,880
This is the first time I have received a gift

166
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:08,561
Like a dream

167
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:12,801
Shen Que ah

168
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:17,760
You will receive many, many presents in the future

169
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,201
Your Future

170
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:22,201
Lots and lots of good things will happen

171
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,760
My future

172
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,201
What's my future like

173
00:13:26,961 --> 00:13:31,400
Your future will be because of kindness and integrity

174
00:13:32,321 --> 00:13:34,000
Win the respect of many people

175
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:37,321
You'll have a great family

176
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:38,760
No more separation

177
00:13:40,801 --> 00:13:41,480
despair

178
00:13:43,841 --> 00:13:44,520
loneliness

179
00:13:51,561 --> 00:13:52,880
Fairy Sister

180
00:13:53,201 --> 00:13:54,681
You seem to be hurt

181
00:13:55,841 --> 00:13:56,681
How could it be

182
00:13:59,081 --> 00:14:00,841
Fairies can't get hurt

183
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,520
But

184
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,760
You sound in pain

185
00:14:06,561 --> 00:14:09,400
Your hour is coming and you don't do it

186
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,600
Shen ensures heavy

187
00:14:18,081 --> 00:14:20,120
I'll keep this bell forever

188
00:14:27,520 --> 00:14:28,321
What are you saying

189
00:14:30,081 --> 00:14:31,480
Whenever and wherever

190
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:33,681
I'll always carry this bell

191
00:14:45,721 --> 00:14:46,321
Give me back

192
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,961
Shen Que, remember

193
00:14:57,640 --> 00:14:59,360
No matter what happens in the future

194
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,240
Even if everyone

195
00:15:08,561 --> 00:15:10,801
Even if everyone

196
00:15:12,640 --> 00:15:13,681
All leave you

197
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:15,880
They turned their backs on you

198
00:15:17,441 --> 00:15:18,760
Don't forget who you are

199
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:20,240
Is it okay

200
00:15:25,841 --> 00:15:26,801
The moon is beautiful

201
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,321
If you're lonely in the future

202
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,721
Just look at the moon

203
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:34,721
Good

204
00:15:35,801 --> 00:15:36,520
Who's talking

205
00:15:37,321 --> 00:15:38,280
Where did the damn girl come from

206
00:15:38,681 --> 00:15:39,400
Looking for death

207
00:15:42,801 --> 00:15:44,000
My eyes

208
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:44,640
In-charge

209
00:15:45,081 --> 00:15:45,721
In-charge

210
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,000
My eyes

211
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:47,880
Fairy Sister

212
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,721
In-charge

213
00:15:49,201 --> 00:15:50,161
Fairy Sister

214
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,721
Fairy Sister

215
00:15:53,801 --> 00:15:56,000
Fairy Sister Fairy Sister

216
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:00,041
Fairy Sister Fairy Sister

217
00:16:00,801 --> 00:16:02,201
Fairy Sister

218
00:16:16,721 --> 00:16:18,321
Dongmei was not killed by Shen Que

219
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:20,400
what

220
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:24,201
Thanks to you for letting me go back to his past

221
00:16:24,201 --> 00:16:25,041
Let me know

222
00:16:25,961 --> 00:16:27,841
The bell Shen Que is wearing close to his body

223
00:16:29,201 --> 00:16:30,441
It's from me

224
00:16:34,721 --> 00:16:37,561
The murderer who killed Dongmei wants to frame Shen Que

225
00:16:37,681 --> 00:16:39,041
Imitated a bell

226
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:44,801
I hadn't paid much attention to his bells before

227
00:16:45,081 --> 00:16:48,841
At first glance, I thought the bell was his

228
00:16:50,161 --> 00:16:52,400
But if this bell is my stitch

229
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,760
Hand-sewn

230
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:56,441
Am I not clear yet

231
00:16:58,561 --> 00:16:59,441
Who is the murderer

232
00:17:03,161 --> 00:17:04,000
I'll check it myself

233
00:17:04,841 --> 00:17:05,841
You saw

234
00:17:06,441 --> 00:17:08,161
He is a wicked man with a deep murder

235
00:17:08,921 --> 00:17:09,921
Why don't you kill him

236
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,401
All I saw was a poor man

237
00:17:12,721 --> 00:17:14,040
You don't have to care about him

238
00:17:14,441 --> 00:17:15,441
He's not real

239
00:17:15,441 --> 00:17:16,601
Why is it not real

240
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,601
What I just saw

241
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:20,401
Everything is fake

242
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,080
His experience, everything he has

243
00:17:23,320 --> 00:17:25,401
His pain was all real

244
00:17:26,280 --> 00:17:28,760
He is not a shadow used to set off the protagonist's glory

245
00:17:29,681 --> 00:17:32,601
He is a living man of flesh and blood

246
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:07,881
Shen Que

247
00:18:08,881 --> 00:18:10,480
Shen Tu Hu, how's your trial going

248
00:18:11,601 --> 00:18:13,080
The mouth is very hard and I didn't pry it open

249
00:18:13,361 --> 00:18:14,601
No way you

250
00:18:18,641 --> 00:18:19,320
Shen Que

251
00:18:20,681 --> 00:18:22,040
My father is already looking for someone

252
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,921
It's a good day for us to get married

253
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:25,401
I'm trying to drag it off

254
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
I'm sorry for asking you to play with me to prevaricate him

255
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:31,320
How can you not help a comrade in arms in trouble

256
00:18:31,881 --> 00:18:32,721
Interesting enough
