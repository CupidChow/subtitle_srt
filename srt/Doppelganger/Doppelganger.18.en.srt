1
00:00:59,560 --> 00:01:00,879
My Qianqian

2
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,360
My Qianqian

3
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:04,680
Mrs. Yao

4
00:01:05,879 --> 00:01:07,000
Mrs. Yao, please condolence

5
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,400
Lord and the others are coming

6
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:13,959
That's all

7
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:16,480
Madam

8
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:18,159
We're going

9
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:19,679
Excuse me

10
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,239
go

11
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:43,840
Mrs. Yao Mrs. Yao Mrs. Yao

12
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,120
Mrs. Yao

13
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:48,920
My

14
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:52,799
madam

15
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,480
My Qianqian

16
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,679
Mother came to see you

17
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,400
Shen Que

18
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:20,639
Why

19
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,280
Why do you do this

20
00:02:26,039 --> 00:02:27,479
What to do with the general's body

21
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,520
Lady Jiang, why are you here

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,560
General Shen

23
00:02:32,199 --> 00:02:34,120
Why did you kill Qianqian's whole family

24
00:02:34,639 --> 00:02:36,919
They are all honest and good people

25
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,560
Why kill them

26
00:02:40,759 --> 00:02:41,919
You shouldn't be here

27
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,000
I asked you why you killed them

28
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,919
They should be punished for making mistakes

29
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:58,879
There are so many people up and down in Yao Mansion

30
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,919
Is it all wrong

31
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:03,599
Right

32
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:05,759
Good

33
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:07,960
Even so

34
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:11,319
Why not hand it over to the government for trial and conviction

35
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:13,879
But you want to slaughter the whole family in the middle of the night

36
00:03:14,520 --> 00:03:15,639
This is a secret military order

37
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:16,759
We must cut the gordian knot quickly

38
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:18,240
They're not a mess

39
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,840
They are strips

40
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,639
They are living lives

41
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,359
Shen Que

42
00:03:28,759 --> 00:03:30,560
Amo, take them back first

43
00:03:32,960 --> 00:03:33,639
Jiang Niangzi

44
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,400
Let's go

45
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,680
Shen Que received Zhang Chao's order

46
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:12,840
Massacre Yao Xiaozhi's family

47
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:16,000
Yao Qianqian fell in front of her father

48
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,280
Being pierced by Shen Que's sword

49
00:04:18,879 --> 00:04:20,639
The smell of blood in the air

50
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,999
Let Shen Que miss his military career

51
00:04:23,799 --> 00:04:24,640
Soon after

52
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,599
Shen Que once again received instructions from his adoptive father

53
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,479
The general is not alive

54
00:04:32,119 --> 00:04:32,919
The next one

55
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,479
Shen Que only recognizes his adoptive father

56
00:04:37,239 --> 00:04:38,679
Zhang Chao said they were guilty

57
00:04:39,400 --> 00:04:41,479
They deserve to die

58
00:04:43,679 --> 00:04:44,720
Future Shen Que

59
00:04:45,039 --> 00:04:47,039
To eradicate dissidents for his foster father

60
00:04:47,359 --> 00:04:48,840
Killed more people

61
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:54,520
Jiang Song

62
00:04:56,359 --> 00:04:58,039
Didn't I ask Amo to take you back

63
00:04:59,280 --> 00:04:59,960
Shen Que

64
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,599
If Qianqian is still alive

65
00:05:03,159 --> 00:05:06,359
Are you gonna kill her too

66
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:08,320
This is a secret military order

67
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,880
I can't tell you

68
00:05:10,159 --> 00:05:10,999
Military secret orders

69
00:05:12,119 --> 00:05:13,599
Is it your foster father's instruction

70
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,200
Shen Que

71
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:26,080
Will you come with me

72
00:05:27,359 --> 00:05:28,159
Where to go

73
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,840
Stay away from the capital

74
00:05:29,999 --> 00:05:30,999
Stay away from your foster father

75
00:05:31,359 --> 00:05:32,359
Stay away from it all

76
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:33,799
I'm with you

77
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:40,640
I also want to

78
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:43,119
But I can't

79
00:05:44,559 --> 00:05:45,280
Why

80
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,239
I have unfinished business

81
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:53,799
The unfinished business

82
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,479
Something must be done

83
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,679
To kill people

84
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:03,760
Killing innocent people indiscriminately

85
00:06:06,679 --> 00:06:08,200
I don't like that

86
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,640
Don't do it, okay

87
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,200
Killing

88
00:06:17,159 --> 00:06:18,400
Do you think I want to do it

89
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,799
Do you think I have a choice

90
00:06:21,679 --> 00:06:22,799
Indiscriminate killing of innocent people

91
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,280
Then I'll just tell you

92
00:06:27,679 --> 00:06:28,599
Make a contribution

93
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,679
Of course, you have to step on countless corpses to get to the top

94
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:32,520
How do you think I am

95
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,840
To where we are today

96
00:06:35,559 --> 00:06:37,400
You want to know how many people I killed, don't you

97
00:06:37,679 --> 00:06:38,479
Don't say it

98
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:39,840
Don't say it

99
00:06:40,159 --> 00:06:40,960
I don't want to hear it

100
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,999
Whether you want to hear it or not

101
00:06:42,359 --> 00:06:43,080
This is what I am

102
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,400
This is what I've done

103
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:55,280
You wait for me

104
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,159
adoptive mother

105
00:07:15,999 --> 00:07:17,599
The Yao family's affairs have been dealt with

106
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:19,440
Yes

107
00:07:19,880 --> 00:07:21,840
Yao Xiaozhi committed perjury that year

108
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,159
Say that the prince keeps night walkers privately

109
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:29,159
The East Palace was completely killed by the Queen Mother

110
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,359
He deserves it too

111
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,200
adoptive mother

112
00:07:34,679 --> 00:07:36,039
Yao Xiaozhi confessed before his death

113
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,359
Over the years, he has put several night walkers

114
00:07:38,359 --> 00:07:39,880
Raised in the mansion in the name of the servant

115
00:07:40,239 --> 00:07:41,880
It's a pity that no one was caught alive

116
00:07:42,239 --> 00:07:43,599
After the Prince's accident

117
00:07:44,320 --> 00:07:46,559
The trail of the night walker disappeared overnight

118
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:47,880
Now it seems

119
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Should have been hidden by the queen mother

120
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,359
I'll keep searching

121
00:07:56,799 --> 00:07:57,520
By the way

122
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:01,280
That woman named Jiang Song is not suitable for you

123
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,400
She

124
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,159
She's the person I cherish most

125
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:06,840
I said she wasn't right for you

126
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,239
You understand that, don't you

127
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,159
Saved a few sinners

128
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,159
Just think of yourself as a good person

129
00:08:15,999 --> 00:08:17,559
People like you and me

130
00:08:18,799 --> 00:08:20,119
Deep killing

131
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:22,479
Can't hide

132
00:08:24,359 --> 00:08:25,359
If you let her know

133
00:08:25,359 --> 00:08:27,119
What did you ever do

134
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:29,960
She's gonna leave you

135
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,200
Think about it

136
00:08:47,599 --> 00:08:49,160
Looks like she won't be coming

137
00:08:52,359 --> 00:08:53,160
Jiang Jiaojiao

138
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,479
How are you here

139
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:56,800
Do you want to come with me

140
00:08:57,479 --> 00:08:58,639
I came here to ask you

141
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,320
When you wrote the character Shen Que

142
00:09:01,759 --> 00:09:03,359
What kind of man is he really

143
00:09:04,479 --> 00:09:05,519
You flipped the book

144
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,119
He's the biggest villain in the book

145
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:12,519
Once upon a time he slaughtered the city with his foster father

146
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,960
He will definitely look more and more like his foster father in the future

147
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,040
Brutal and murderous

148
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,639
But you wrote that Choi You-an was a gentleman

149
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:20,920
It doesn't fit either

150
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,320
But his experience is similar to the past of the novel

151
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:24,639
You want to

152
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:25,920
Death of Cicada Mother

153
00:09:26,639 --> 00:09:29,239
So Shen Que will definitely massacre the village in the future

154
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,359
be careful

155
00:09:37,599 --> 00:09:38,440
Jiang Jiaojiao

156
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,080
I'll get you out

157
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:41,960
You want to get out of town

158
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:43,879
Actually you don't have to go

159
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,560
Just kill Jiang Song

160
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:47,519
You're the absolute heroine

161
00:09:48,239 --> 00:09:49,160
You crazy man

162
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,080
Can I not be the heroine anymore

163
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,560
It's not up to you then

164
00:09:53,599 --> 00:09:54,200
Go quick

165
00:10:27,759 --> 00:10:28,759
Really come back

166
00:10:33,479 --> 00:10:34,160
You

167
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:41,040
I changed back

168
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:43,359
Jiang Jiaojiao

169
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,759
That's where I jumped

170
00:10:53,879 --> 00:10:56,320
Then I woke up and saw a door

171
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,399
This door is still glowing

172
00:10:58,840 --> 00:11:00,519
Jump from that height

173
00:11:01,479 --> 00:11:04,160
But didn't you say you were dead

174
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:06,160
I feel strange, too

175
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,359
Maybe the book-piercing system protected me

176
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:11,639
Come on, I'll take you home

177
00:11:11,879 --> 00:11:13,560
I miss flavored crayfish

178
00:11:14,479 --> 00:11:15,599
Look at that thing in the sky

179
00:11:15,599 --> 00:11:16,800
Does it look like an eye

180
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,239
Jiang Song

181
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:46,040
Jiang Song, where are you

182
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,479
Jiaojiaojiaojiao

183
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,879
Jiaojiao, you're back

184
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:56,239
Then let's continue playing the game

185
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,800
Look at all the pockmarks on her face

186
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,479
I'm afraid there's not some infectious disease

187
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:05,359
Shut up, I guess

188
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:06,599
Look, she doesn't like to be clean

189
00:12:06,599 --> 00:12:07,399
Shut up

190
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,720
I don't know how many viruses there are

191
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,279
Everyone should stay away from her

192
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,200
Let's not get infected

193
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,720
Just go, go

194
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:25,160
Jiang Jiaojiao

195
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,320
Jiang Jiaojiao

196
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,279
What's going on

197
00:12:31,239 --> 00:12:34,119
This is not the real world

198
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:36,920
Go quick

199
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:52,080
Go quick

200
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,479
Gone, all gone

201
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,840
Ma'am, are you okay

202
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,279
What day is it, please

203
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:50,639
Little New Year

204
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:55,639
Half a year has passed in the city

205
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,999
It's getting dark

206
00:13:59,239 --> 00:14:00,560
The Night Guard is going to kill

207
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:01,879
Coming home soon

208
00:14:01,879 --> 00:14:02,840
Let's go, hurry, hurry

209
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,639
come

210
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,320
The city is not peaceful right now

211
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,080
Lady, please go home quickly

212
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:35,960
a form of address for one's wife

213
00:14:42,759 --> 00:14:43,840
Since you left

214
00:14:44,119 --> 00:14:45,359
Days are getting harder and harder

215
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,119
Dongmei goes up the mountain to collect herbs and sell them for money

216
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,800
Mistakenly picked Ganoderma lucidum from the hill of Zhen Guogong's son

217
00:14:50,359 --> 00:14:51,479
Was caught in jail

218
00:14:52,519 --> 00:14:54,040
Son of Duke Zhen Guo

219
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:55,800
Called Qin Sizhe

220
00:14:56,239 --> 00:14:57,440
A dandy

221
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:58,920
He insisted that we pay three thousand taels

222
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,040
Only then did he release Dongmei blossoms

223
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:01,840
How can we have that much money

224
00:15:03,359 --> 00:15:05,239
Life is really unable to go on

225
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,560
Soo Soo went home

226
00:15:09,359 --> 00:15:10,599
Soo Soo went home

227
00:15:11,999 --> 00:15:13,119
Ke Xiuxiu began

228
00:15:13,359 --> 00:15:15,200
Didn't you just get hurt by your family

229
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,440
Yeah, but at least she'll have something to eat when she goes back

230
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:20,359
People live

231
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:23,920
Sometimes it's even worse than a dog

232
00:15:25,519 --> 00:15:27,040
I'll ask the doctor not

233
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:28,599
I'm fine

234
00:15:28,879 --> 00:15:30,920
There is no money to treat Ruixue

235
00:15:31,479 --> 00:15:33,680
If Miaohua hadn't brought food from time to time

236
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:36,080
We're starving to death

237
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:37,639
Miaohua

238
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:47,160
Shen Que

239
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:49,399
How is he

240
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,239
General Shen Shen

241
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:56,960
Let's eat

242
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:02,960
Lady, please eat quickly

243
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,800
You wouldn't say

244
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,399
Did something happen to him

245
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:14,960
The new emperor attaches great importance to General Shen

246
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,359
The general impose many draconian laws and regulations

247
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,999
Also established the Dark Night Guard

248
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:20,279
Dark Night Guard

249
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,560
The night guard broke into someone's house in the middle of the night

250
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,119
then

251
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:26,040
Then what

252
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:27,800
Go on a murder

253
00:16:30,879 --> 00:16:31,759
Why kill

254
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:34,960
Rumor has it that people who offended General Zhang Chao

255
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,160
Future Shen Que

256
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:41,239
To eradicate dissidents for his foster father

257
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,119
Killed more, more people

258
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:44,840
He's the biggest villain in the book

259
00:16:45,320 --> 00:16:48,160
Once upon a time he slaughtered the city with his foster father

260
00:16:48,599 --> 00:16:50,519
He's gonna look more and more like his foster father

261
00:16:50,519 --> 00:16:51,680
Brutal and murderous

262
00:16:54,479 --> 00:16:55,279
By the way

263
00:16:55,639 --> 00:16:59,800
There is another woman named Qin Shuang in the Dark Night Guard

264
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,759
He's the sister of that bad guy Qin Sizhe

265
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,040
But she's a very powerful female general

266
00:17:06,519 --> 00:17:07,440
Rumor

267
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,040
She and General Shen were comrades-in-arms for many years

268
00:17:10,440 --> 00:17:11,999
Last month and General

269
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:13,759
And general

270
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:17,079
Get engaged

271
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,079
a form of address for one's wife

272
00:17:22,479 --> 00:17:23,799
General Shen must have thought

273
00:17:23,799 --> 00:17:25,160
You will never come back

274
00:17:25,720 --> 00:17:26,680
You go to him

275
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,720
He will definitely change his mind

276
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,600
Shen Que

277
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,360
Since I decided to engage her

278
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:41,079
It must have been thought out

279
00:17:50,079 --> 00:17:51,600
People in there get out of here

280
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,039
Pay off debts

281
00:17:53,519 --> 00:17:55,120
Or I'll burn down this shitty house

282
00:17:55,519 --> 00:17:56,400
What do you want

283
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,200
There's a new face

284
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,120
Let go

285
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,720
It's natural to pay off debts

286
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,239
Since you don't have any money

287
00:18:09,479 --> 00:18:12,400
I have to take you into a brothel to pay off your debts

288
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:13,920
Do you still have a king law

289
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:16,799
Shen Que, who now covers the sky with one hand in the capital

290
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,720
But my future brother-in-law

291
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,440
Lao Tzu is Wang Fa

292
00:18:25,319 --> 00:18:25,999
Let go let go

293
00:18:25,999 --> 00:18:26,759
Lady, run!

294
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,479
Go away

295
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:28,880
Go away

296
00:18:29,479 --> 00:18:30,479
Lady, run!

297
00:18:31,279 --> 00:18:32,279
Go away, go away

298
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:33,640
Get away from me

299
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:36,239
Chase

300
00:18:36,759 --> 00:18:37,559
Go away and still

301
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:56,600
Come soon

302
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,920
Eat more

303
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:06,479
You see, you have lost weight
