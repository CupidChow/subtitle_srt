1
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:05,760
General

2
00:01:05,839 --> 00:01:07,400
If it's not good, spies will report

3
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,439
Cui You'an will get married again

4
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,839
Yes Yes and Jiang Niangzi

5
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:16,359
Can't it be that Lady Jiang really wants to marry into the Prime Minister's Mansion

6
00:01:30,559 --> 00:01:31,800
Why do you do this to me

7
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:32,880
Let me go

8
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:38,520
The Lord said

9
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:40,199
Just playing for Jiang Song

10
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:41,960
Tied with a slipknot

11
00:01:42,559 --> 00:01:44,320
Drop the white cloth when you can't help it

12
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,680
I let go and you play dead

13
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:53,479
Nineteen

14
00:01:53,919 --> 00:01:55,160
Pain 19

15
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,559
Don't stop without my instructions

16
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:05,320
pain

17
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:06,919
Nineteen pain

18
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,160
Just ask me

19
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:15,760
You can get revenge

20
00:02:16,639 --> 00:02:17,720
How does it feel

21
00:02:19,639 --> 00:02:20,359
Not bad

22
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:22,760
But not enough to relieve hatred

23
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,639
I'll kill her myself

24
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:28,519
pain

25
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:30,079
Good

26
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,320
NO

27
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:59,000
Don't don't

28
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,919
Jiang Song, I beg you

29
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,320
Don't kill me

30
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,320
I'll do it myself

31
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:05,079
Good

32
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,239
Jiang Song

33
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,440
I beg you, don't kill me

34
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:14,720
don't

35
00:03:15,479 --> 00:03:16,199
don't

36
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:17,720
Jiang Song

37
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:19,479
I beg you, don't kill me

38
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,880
Jiang Song, I beg you

39
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:24,079
Leave me alone, don't kill me

40
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,679
don't

41
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:28,320
don't

42
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:45,639
Jiang Song

43
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,280
You're seeking death

44
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:49,880
Let her go

45
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,799
Cry and hate me

46
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,239
Who called me your creator

47
00:04:02,679 --> 00:04:03,760
What are you laughing about

48
00:04:06,639 --> 00:04:07,799
My Creator

49
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,440
You must have a way to get me out of town, right

50
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,199
I've made you so badly

51
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:16,720
You don't cry or make trouble

52
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:18,760
You asked me to find a way to get you out of town

53
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:21,440
Tears are useless and hurt the body

54
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,719
Hate blinds the mind

55
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,079
No eternal enemies

56
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:27,959
Only companions at the right time and place

57
00:04:28,760 --> 00:04:30,279
You and I are on the same page

58
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:31,880
Don't fight between the snipe and the clam

59
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:34,079
It's better to put aside the past feud

60
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:36,959
Make a deal with me

61
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,120
You don't have anything

62
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,560
What can it bring me

63
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,240
Have you ever thought

64
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,039
You don't need Choi Woo-an's shelter

65
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,360
But a weapon of self-defense

66
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:51,039
I just have Choi Woo-an

67
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:53,000
He has everything, but it's his

68
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:57,800
He gave it to you

69
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,719
Why don't you try to put everything

70
00:05:00,719 --> 00:05:01,959
All in your own hands

71
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:03,959
That's enough. Don't try to bewitch me

72
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,959
You're trying to trick me to leave

73
00:05:06,039 --> 00:05:07,680
Then take my place

74
00:05:12,599 --> 00:05:14,159
The supporting character in the story is awakened

75
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:15,240
Will definitely try my best

76
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,440
Change the ending and become the main character

77
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,959
Where do you get the confidence

78
00:05:19,959 --> 00:05:21,000
The story you designed

79
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,279
It will be more exciting than the life I walked out of

80
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:24,959
You

81
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,440
An ant's opinion

82
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,440
People

83
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,920
It hurts if you don't fall

84
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:41,079
You can't learn to avoid pitfalls

85
00:05:42,480 --> 00:05:43,480
Put the arrow down

86
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,000
Come over

87
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:47,039
I let you take revenge

88
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:48,480
Isn't it bad to get your sight back

89
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:50,639
By humiliating other women

90
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,800
Alms to my preference

91
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,839
I don't want dogs

92
00:05:57,599 --> 00:05:59,279
She and I are not your pets

93
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,519
Not inferior to you

94
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,399
Don't need your rewards and punishments

95
00:06:03,079 --> 00:06:04,880
She's afraid of your power

96
00:06:05,599 --> 00:06:06,599
Is a fool

97
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,680
But you who take advantage of this

98
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,760
Is the most hateful thing

99
00:06:12,079 --> 00:06:13,000
What are you saying

100
00:06:17,599 --> 00:06:18,399
Lord

101
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:28,399
Get up and I'll take you away

102
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:37,920
Are you okay

103
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:53,719
Over there

104
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:01,599
Don't

105
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:03,159
Jiang Jiaojiao

106
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,800
Aren't you awake

107
00:07:06,079 --> 00:07:06,680
NO

108
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,360
He didn't really want to kill me

109
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,159
Or he wouldn't have let Nineteen tell me

110
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:12,399
It's just a show

111
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:13,880
You asked what I could give you

112
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:15,159
First piece

113
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:17,880
Just to point you out one

114
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:19,599
A way out of the cage

115
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:21,000
The road is in sight

116
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,800
Will you leave or not

117
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,440
You think you're gonna get out

118
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,240
Isn't it a cage if you escape outside

119
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,199
Let me tell you

120
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:30,880
What is the woman's cage outside

121
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,880
It's appearance

122
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,839
Unbeautiful and guilty

123
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,159
Beauty is also guilty

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,480
An ugly monster and a vixen

125
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,880
What a coincidence they're all in our class

126
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:52,839
Is the ability

127
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,480
Ordinary guilty

128
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:56,519
Extraordinary and Guilty

129
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,519
What happened to my bedroom surveillance

130
00:07:58,519 --> 00:07:59,880
I'm your guardian

131
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:00,719
How old are you

132
00:08:00,719 --> 00:08:01,760
I have to care about you

133
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,880
You're disobedient at such an old age

134
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,519
You have your own opinion, right

135
00:08:05,519 --> 00:08:07,240
Look what you're drawing

136
00:08:07,240 --> 00:08:08,279
Is age

137
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,800
Young and guilty

138
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,039
Older is also guilty

139
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:12,519
Every time I say I'm partial

140
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:13,959
It's just an egg

141
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,079
How old are you

142
00:08:15,079 --> 00:08:16,719
What's wrong with letting my brother eat first

143
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,159
What did you learn at school

144
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,360
The bigger you are, the more you will become. The bigger you are, the more ignorant you are

145
00:08:21,480 --> 00:08:22,560
Our cage

146
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,959
It's a pair of eyes that judge us

147
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,360
We seem to have a lot of choices

148
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,199
actually

149
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,959
We have no choice at all

150
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:35,519
Then don't wait for others to give you a choice

151
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,719
Go out of your own way

152
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:45,600
How to get there

153
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:50,319
Press the signal flare

154
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,279
Shen will certainly come to our rescue

155
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,159
Jiang Jiaojiao

156
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,319
Jiang Jiaojiao

157
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:09,760
Jiang Jiaojiao

158
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:12,960
Jiaojiao

159
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:14,760
It hurts

160
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:16,760
Jiang Jiaojiao

161
00:09:17,319 --> 00:09:19,200
The antidote is in his hand

162
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,880
Run fast

163
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,319
Since you're not good

164
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:15,760
I can only send you to hell

165
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:17,600
It's just a pity

166
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:19,159
I haven't had enough

167
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,679
be careful

168
00:10:32,679 --> 00:10:33,559
Jiang Song

169
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:34,639
Shen Que

170
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,519
Jiang Song

171
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:46,319
Is Shen sure all right

172
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:49,120
Jiang Song Jiang Song

173
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:07,240
Lord

174
00:11:09,319 --> 00:11:10,720
Bachelor Cui, wait

175
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:16,039
She's a fugitive criminal woman

176
00:11:16,159 --> 00:11:17,600
They're going to be executed tomorrow

177
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:21,159
General Shen and our family were imprisoned by order

178
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,039
De father-in-law and dog son

179
00:11:23,120 --> 00:11:23,840
Prime Minister

180
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,159
My family understands

181
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:27,319
Guilty girl escaped from prison and absconded

182
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:29,880
Bachelor Cui saw her pitiful and kindly took her in

183
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,080
Who thought

184
00:11:31,519 --> 00:11:33,159
She's on death row

185
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:33,880
Yes, yes, yes

186
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:34,679
Right

187
00:11:35,799 --> 00:11:37,439
Thank you for your work General Shen

188
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:20,880
Cui Yongzi

189
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:25,480
Jiang Niangzi

190
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,080
I didn't see you in my house today

191
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,559
I didn't expect to meet you here

192
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:31,279
What happened

193
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,639
The farce in the restaurant a few days ago

194
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,039
I'm so sorry

195
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,039
I can't remember quite

196
00:12:39,039 --> 00:12:41,439
But I must have been obsessed

197
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,519
Yesterday, the prime minister's office came to propose marriage

198
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:46,279
I'm really ashamed

199
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:48,799
Isn't that what Lady Jiang wants

200
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:51,679
Under means

201
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,000
This marriage will help my wife out of trouble, won't it

202
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,039
Yes

203
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:58,639
But it is

204
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,240
I'm sorry for you

205
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:02,880
Male marriage female marriage

206
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
People's ethics

207
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:08,679
Actually, it makes no difference to me

208
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,799
Young Master Cui today

209
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:15,000
Are you in a bad mood

210
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:17,519
It's probably because of the Qingming Festival

211
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:19,279
Yeah

212
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:21,279
There is a lot of rain during Qingming Festival

213
00:13:21,919 --> 00:13:24,039
Pedestrians on the road want to die

214
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,080
Every river lamp

215
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,319
It's a letter sent to the deceased

216
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,880
We're lighting Daddy's river lights

217
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
Young Master Cui, do you want to order one too

218
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:34,760
You can encourage to send your sorrow

219
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,039
No need

220
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:41,919
The girl leaves first

221
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,399
Jiang Niangzi

222
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
If someone close to you dies

223
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,080
There is no grief in the heart

224
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:52,080
In Jiang Lady's view

225
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,279
Is this kind of person unheartless

226
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:56,799
Not necessarily

227
00:13:59,919 --> 00:14:00,960
Man's grief

228
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,439
Or heartbroken like a storm

229
00:14:03,559 --> 00:14:05,960
Or it lasts for a long time and wet as a plum rain

230
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,840
But there is another

231
00:14:08,519 --> 00:14:09,840
Years of ignorance

232
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,720
But at one moment it broke through the ground

233
00:14:12,159 --> 00:14:15,559
Only then did I realize that it had been growing wildly in the dark

234
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,159
Does this kind of person deserve to be forgiven

235
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:22,760
Is it worth it

236
00:14:23,919 --> 00:14:25,000
Just ask yourself

237
00:14:31,799 --> 00:14:32,600
Thank you

238
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,639
This is the lotus pond fish cake I made

239
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,480
If the young master does not dislike it

240
00:14:38,159 --> 00:14:39,080
Please have a taste

241
00:14:42,039 --> 00:14:42,840
farewell

242
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,319
Lady Jiang, you also come to put on the river lantern, yes

243
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,279
This flavor

244
00:15:18,159 --> 00:15:20,439
Endless lights are like a lamp

245
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:26,000
Those who burn hundreds of thousands of lamps are obvious and never ending

246
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,720
Obviously, life is like grass

247
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,120
But how can it look like a Bodhisattva's eyebrows low

248
00:15:38,679 --> 00:15:40,600
Why can't I do it

249
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:43,480
Why

250
00:15:57,639 --> 00:15:58,720
General Shen

251
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,600
The guilty girl was taken away by Bachelor Cui

252
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:05,399
Our family knows that you are forced by the Cui family's power

253
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:06,960
Really helpless

254
00:16:08,080 --> 00:16:10,360
Our family won't give it to the saint

255
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,240
Thank you for your understanding

256
00:16:13,159 --> 00:16:14,200
Officialdom

257
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:16,840
You have me and I have you

258
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,559
I just hope the general can take care of our family in the future

259
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,439
Father-in-law Deming, it's time

260
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,039
execute

261
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:06,120
I was molested by a waiver

262
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,039
My husband's family polluted me for adultery

263
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:09,760
Wronged

264
00:17:11,279 --> 00:17:14,200
I served my in-laws for fifteen years after being widowed

265
00:17:15,279 --> 00:17:17,119
The county lieutenant said to give me a virgin plaque

266
00:17:17,559 --> 00:17:18,760
I asked him to switch to food

267
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,599
He blames me for being disrespectful

268
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:20,960
Am I guilty please

269
00:17:24,879 --> 00:17:26,400
I killed my man

270
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,279
He hit me

271
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:30,039
I'll beat him

272
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:32,200
I am guilty

273
00:17:32,879 --> 00:17:33,839
But I don't recognize it

274
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,720
I disguised myself as a man for the imperial examination

275
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,160
Be seen through

276
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,879
It's not a pity to die for ambition

277
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,039
Deming's father-in-law General Shen

278
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,799
The autopsy has been completed

279
00:18:48,519 --> 00:18:49,240
Father-in-law

280
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,680
The execution is completed

281
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,240
You can go back and resume your life

282
00:18:52,519 --> 00:18:54,480
Leave the rest to me

283
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,400
Amo

284
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:57,839
And so on

285
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:01,279
Our family has always had a bodhisattva heart

286
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:05,200
Let these guilty women be buried

287
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,039
Or is my father-in-law considerate?

288
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,720
Seal the coffin and bury the body
