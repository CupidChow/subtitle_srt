1
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:17,801
Let go

2
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:21,441
Mother

3
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,480
Mother

4
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,360
Come back here

5
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:26,640
Let go

6
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,560
I still want to run

7
00:01:30,681 --> 00:01:32,080
I let you run

8
00:01:32,241 --> 00:01:32,881
Run

9
00:01:56,801 --> 00:01:57,480
Let her go

10
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:58,681
Let her go

11
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:00,321
Bad guy bad guy

12
00:02:00,681 --> 00:02:01,280
Let her go

13
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,120
Get the hell out of me

14
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,000
Smelly beggar

15
00:02:06,401 --> 00:02:07,480
One after another

16
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:09,161
One after another

17
00:03:04,001 --> 00:03:04,800
Wake up

18
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,561
Don't sleep, I'll take you to the doctor

19
00:03:10,001 --> 00:03:10,640
Don't sleep

20
00:03:10,881 --> 00:03:11,400
Don't sleep

21
00:03:11,721 --> 00:03:12,161
go

22
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:13,601
No need

23
00:03:16,121 --> 00:03:17,121
I'm so tired

24
00:03:19,041 --> 00:03:20,321
All my life

25
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:23,441
Been sold too many times

26
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,321
Been a daughter

27
00:03:26,561 --> 00:03:27,841
Concubine

28
00:03:28,561 --> 00:03:29,601
Mother

29
00:03:30,281 --> 00:03:31,121
This time

30
00:03:31,721 --> 00:03:33,360
Finally being myself

31
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:35,680
My name is

32
00:03:36,761 --> 00:03:38,001
Adie

33
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:42,721
A little butterfly

34
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:46,041
Fly over Guanyin Bridge

35
00:03:47,561 --> 00:03:48,721
Cross again

36
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:52,441
Samsara Gate

37
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:55,321
Adie

38
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,200
Wake up

39
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:00,881
Adie

40
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:02,561
Adie

41
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:03,680
Wake up

42
00:04:58,600 --> 00:04:59,200
stop

43
00:05:00,681 --> 00:05:02,321
Isn't this the madwoman

44
00:05:02,921 --> 00:05:04,080
Finally dead

45
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:07,280
Ask the official, master, to be kind

46
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,921
I want her to be buried

47
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:13,761
A joke of a nameless paria

48
00:05:13,761 --> 00:05:14,881
Can't even enter the ancestral temple

49
00:05:15,001 --> 00:05:15,960
Also buried in the earth

50
00:05:16,241 --> 00:05:17,600
The corpses of these refugees

51
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,720
Throw them into mass graves and feed them to dogs

52
00:05:20,001 --> 00:05:21,040
Sir, please take it away

53
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,600
Ask the official, master, to be kind

54
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,681
Don't go

55
00:05:23,681 --> 00:05:25,080
Don't be an official, sir

56
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,361
Lord, please

57
00:05:26,481 --> 00:05:27,280
Please let go

58
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,280
Let me bury her

59
00:05:28,321 --> 00:05:30,121
If you don't let go, I'll cut off your hand

60
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,720
General Shen

61
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,520
You guys

62
00:05:42,801 --> 00:05:43,801
Don't get rid of violence and peace

63
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,121
Instead of causing trouble here

64
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,160
The penalty

65
00:05:46,441 --> 00:05:47,720
The general was wronged

66
00:05:47,881 --> 00:05:48,881
According to the law of our court

67
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:51,520
The bodies of nameless people are to be thrown into mass graves

68
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,040
The woman insisted on burying her

69
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,600
It's a great disrespect to Wang Fa

70
00:05:55,801 --> 00:05:56,481
Yeah

71
00:05:58,001 --> 00:05:59,400
Ask the general for mercy beyond the law

72
00:06:00,561 --> 00:06:02,840
Allow me to bury my benefactor

73
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,481
Why should I be merciful

74
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:13,160
The general chased murderers for several years

75
00:06:13,361 --> 00:06:14,361
Kill Li Wuchang

76
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,761
He must be a man who will get his revenge

77
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:18,481
If

78
00:06:20,441 --> 00:06:21,241
If

79
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:24,241
Can I avenge the general

80
00:06:29,321 --> 00:06:30,160
Shut up

81
00:06:33,561 --> 00:06:34,361
What revenge

82
00:06:34,441 --> 00:06:35,681
The general said last time

83
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,761
I resemble an old friend of yours

84
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:41,720
If I could help you find her

85
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:45,720
Would you permit me to bury her

86
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,080
OK

87
00:07:00,441 --> 00:07:01,241
Shen Que

88
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,121
Long time no see

89
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:18,241
She's not my daughter who mutilated her brothers

90
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:20,361
My Jiaojiao is very good

91
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,681
She's not Jiaojiao

92
00:07:22,681 --> 00:07:23,801
Aniang

93
00:07:26,761 --> 00:07:27,720
You

94
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:29,840
Aniangguess

95
00:07:30,801 --> 00:07:31,921
I'm human

96
00:07:32,121 --> 00:07:32,921
Or a ghost

97
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:38,001
Granny brought me into this world

98
00:07:39,561 --> 00:07:41,160
But I don't like it here

99
00:07:43,321 --> 00:07:44,441
Before leaving

100
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,200
Want to come and see you

101
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,200
Good boy

102
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,400
Don't scare my mother

103
00:07:54,361 --> 00:07:56,200
Granny is confessing

104
00:07:57,321 --> 00:07:58,801
Still crossing me

105
00:08:03,361 --> 00:08:04,520
Why do you do this to me

106
00:08:05,681 --> 00:08:06,681
You forgot

107
00:08:07,321 --> 00:08:09,681
You caused Yaozu to lose one hand

108
00:08:09,681 --> 00:08:11,321
He's completely crippled

109
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:14,200
When he almost killed me

110
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,080
You asked me to tolerate him

111
00:08:16,801 --> 00:08:19,241
When I was forced to marry by the Jiang family

112
00:08:19,241 --> 00:08:20,720
You asked me to accept my fate

113
00:08:22,361 --> 00:08:24,481
When another Jiang Jiaojiao appeared

114
00:08:24,881 --> 00:08:26,040
You keep her

115
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:27,400
Because there are two daughters

116
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:30,801
You can help Jiang Yaozu win double the capital

117
00:08:32,160 --> 00:08:32,640
Aniang

118
00:08:33,921 --> 00:08:37,280
Do you really not recognize who your daughter is

119
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,121
Pile by pile

120
00:08:40,841 --> 00:08:42,400
Do you really think

121
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:45,201
Can't I see through

122
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,841
You are suffering

123
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:50,201
But if it wasn't you

124
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:50,881
But if it wasn't you

125
00:08:52,400 --> 00:08:55,440
Can I suffer so much in this Jiang house

126
00:08:56,961 --> 00:08:59,920
Fortunately, there is Yaozu who makes me proud

127
00:09:00,761 --> 00:09:02,961
He could have a bright future

128
00:09:02,961 --> 00:09:04,761
He could have earned me a mandate

129
00:09:04,761 --> 00:09:07,440
You ruined it all

130
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,601
To be your daughter

131
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,761
Is it my fault

132
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,961
It's not your fault

133
00:09:17,601 --> 00:09:19,481
But you're my daughter

134
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:22,040
I'm sore here

135
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:24,761
You have to accompany me in pain

136
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:29,280
The fate of mother and daughter is destined to be the same

137
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:33,881
One day you'll be me

138
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:36,481
You will understand that I

139
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:40,841
You're wrong

140
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,440
I won't continue your fate

141
00:09:44,121 --> 00:09:48,601
You're gonna rot and rot in this cage at the Jiang family

142
00:09:50,761 --> 00:09:51,881
But grandmother

143
00:09:56,121 --> 00:09:57,201
You see

144
00:09:57,881 --> 00:09:58,881
I'm human

145
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,361
Not a ghost

146
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,920
I'm different from you

147
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,721
I will run away

148
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:20,361
Don't be delusional

149
00:10:21,761 --> 00:10:22,961
I can't walk

150
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:25,560
You can't go anywhere

151
00:10:26,121 --> 00:10:27,920
I'm still here

152
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:30,520
Why are you leaving

153
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,361
You are the flesh that falls from me

154
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:36,961
You want to cut our blood ties

155
00:10:37,361 --> 00:10:39,520
It's not that easy

156
00:10:42,280 --> 00:10:43,320
Our blood

157
00:10:44,841 --> 00:10:46,761
Has been cut by your own hands

158
00:10:49,081 --> 00:10:50,160
Jiaojiao

159
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:51,680
Please

160
00:10:52,961 --> 00:10:54,640
Please don't go

161
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:57,481
You pitiful Aniang

162
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:01,121
Granny, it's the only one, Granny

163
00:11:01,121 --> 00:11:02,040
I used to fantasize

164
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:04,280
Use my death to make you regret

165
00:11:04,841 --> 00:11:05,920
I know it's not worth it

166
00:11:06,601 --> 00:11:07,920
But life is what I have

167
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,361
The most precious thing

168
00:11:09,841 --> 00:11:11,280
But not in the future

169
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:14,400
Because I know you won't regret it

170
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:24,601
You're crazy

171
00:11:37,361 --> 00:11:38,121
You

172
00:11:38,881 --> 00:11:41,121
How could this happen

173
00:11:46,121 --> 00:11:47,201
You can't kill me

174
00:11:47,201 --> 00:11:48,560
You won't survive if you kill me

175
00:11:58,800 --> 00:11:59,800
You're crazy

176
00:12:01,361 --> 00:12:02,680
My face

177
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,560
You said

178
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,721
No matter how beautiful porcelain is, it has cracks

179
00:12:11,721 --> 00:12:13,001
It's worthless anymore

180
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,761
You're broken

181
00:12:16,481 --> 00:12:17,881
You're worthless

182
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:21,081
What's in it for you to be crazy

183
00:12:21,241 --> 00:12:22,520
Your face is ruined too

184
00:12:27,761 --> 00:12:28,481
Jiaojiao

185
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,920
We're different

186
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:34,721
I'm human

187
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,400
Not porcelain

188
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,241
I don't need to be perfect

189
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:00,640
Why did you get hurt like this when you went home

190
00:13:04,881 --> 00:13:06,241
I made it myself

191
00:13:22,601 --> 00:13:23,841
Kill him

192
00:13:23,841 --> 00:13:24,961
Wolf's fang

193
00:13:26,841 --> 00:13:28,400
Wolf fangs Wolf fangs

194
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,361
Wolf's fang

195
00:13:29,361 --> 00:13:30,361
Wolf's fang

196
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:04,280
Just him

197
00:14:05,121 --> 00:14:06,241
This guy

198
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,841
Wanting death

199
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,241
Beat but don't hide

200
00:14:09,721 --> 00:14:11,800
There's no point in changing it

201
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:20,601
I know you don't want to survive

202
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,680
I don't want to be a pitbull for these people

203
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:23,721
But I'm on you

204
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:25,640
Made a big, big bet

205
00:14:27,920 --> 00:14:29,201
He's ignoring you

206
00:14:29,201 --> 00:14:30,481
Find another one now

207
00:14:35,961 --> 00:14:36,961
My father's dead

208
00:14:37,361 --> 00:14:39,160
My uncle sold me to Master Zhuang as a slave

209
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,560
I won't be a slave

210
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,560
He ignored you

211
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,761
So you lose

212
00:14:45,201 --> 00:14:45,881
ten

213
00:14:46,361 --> 00:14:47,601
Master Zhuang and I made a bet

214
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:50,280
He said I could go home if I won

215
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:51,040
eight

216
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,481
I'm not risking your life

217
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:54,081
Nor do you think you're a pitbull

218
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:56,800
The bet I bet is my life

219
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,361
Please, please, help me

220
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:01,961
I can't live if you die

221
00:15:02,081 --> 00:15:02,761
five

222
00:15:04,001 --> 00:15:04,920
But you see

223
00:15:05,761 --> 00:15:07,121
The weather is fine today

224
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:09,320
Let's not die yet

225
00:15:09,961 --> 00:15:10,400
three

226
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:11,520
We'll live together

227
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,320
Is it okay

228
00:15:12,881 --> 00:15:13,481
two

229
00:15:15,640 --> 00:15:16,280
one

230
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,560
The hour has come

231
00:15:17,721 --> 00:15:18,520
You lost

232
00:15:19,081 --> 00:15:19,800
Wolf's fang

233
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,160
Have a feast

234
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:24,160
Tear her up

235
00:15:24,201 --> 00:15:25,961
I beg you to help me

236
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:38,440
Tear her, tear her, tear her

237
00:16:01,400 --> 00:16:02,440
Saved

238
00:16:24,121 --> 00:16:24,881
Give me back

239
00:16:30,761 --> 00:16:32,920
I'll pay you back if you beat him

240
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,400
Tear him up

241
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:05,800
Get up

242
00:17:06,721 --> 00:17:08,001
What are you fighting

243
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:27,761
General

244
00:18:27,761 --> 00:18:28,761
She, she fell

245
00:18:30,401 --> 00:18:31,600
She'll climb up by herself

246
00:18:36,481 --> 00:18:37,401
No movement

247
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:39,161
She's not gonna die

248
00:18:50,161 --> 00:18:50,961
Dead

249
00:18:54,921 --> 00:18:56,441
Climb up by yourself if you don't die

250
00:18:58,560 --> 00:18:59,560
So tired

251
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,840
Why don't you be here

252
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,280
Just bury me
