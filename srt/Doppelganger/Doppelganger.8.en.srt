1
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,240
On the Luming Trail in the south of the city

2
00:00:50,761 --> 00:00:52,800
The thatched cottage with a small bridge at the door is

3
00:00:54,081 --> 00:00:56,281
I told the imperial grandson that you would protect him

4
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:02,520
Jiaojiao said

5
00:01:02,681 --> 00:01:04,761
General Shen can enter the house when he comes

6
00:01:16,761 --> 00:01:17,200
Who

7
00:01:17,601 --> 00:01:19,401
I pay my respects to Your Highness in Xiashen

8
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:26,480
Do you eat lychees

9
00:01:27,761 --> 00:01:28,280
Eat

10
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,681
Do you eat coriander then

11
00:01:32,521 --> 00:01:32,920
Eat

12
00:01:33,601 --> 00:01:34,161
Come on in

13
00:01:38,681 --> 00:01:40,441
So that fucking old man is really looking for me

14
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,041
Finished

15
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,560
Uncle Third Emperor must not kill me

16
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:48,521
Seeing that my shop is going to become a century-old shop

17
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:49,640
Century-old shop

18
00:01:50,441 --> 00:01:51,601
If I remember correctly

19
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:52,920
You just turned eighteen

20
00:01:53,161 --> 00:01:53,961
So what's wrong

21
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,801
I invented coriander and lychee sesame cake

22
00:01:56,961 --> 00:01:58,280
It will surely be passed down for generations

23
00:01:59,801 --> 00:02:00,761
You're not going to stop eating

24
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:03,000
You just said you eat coriander and lychee

25
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,080
Someone

26
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,480
Lady Jiang

27
00:02:08,881 --> 00:02:09,801
She's the only one here who knows

28
00:02:11,401 --> 00:02:11,961
be careful

29
00:02:12,801 --> 00:02:14,401
Amo, escort Your Highness away first

30
00:02:14,521 --> 00:02:15,041
Yes

31
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,161
Your Highness

32
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:23,041
If you select me

33
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,640
Tomorrow's time

34
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,001
See you in Yingyuewan

35
00:02:28,161 --> 00:02:30,281
I'll wait for you until tomorrow

36
00:02:31,001 --> 00:02:34,161
I won't take a bite of the medicine until you come

37
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,520
Have you thought about it

38
00:02:37,601 --> 00:02:38,520
Where to go

39
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,640
Who sent you

40
00:03:20,041 --> 00:03:20,601
say

41
00:03:20,761 --> 00:03:21,400
Shen Que

42
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:22,640
You must die today

43
00:03:23,041 --> 00:03:23,881
You've fallen for it

44
00:03:24,001 --> 00:03:24,721
What do you mean

45
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:26,601
Take a look

46
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,640
You said I fell for it

47
00:03:32,881 --> 00:03:33,800
Who did I fall for

48
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,680
Didn't you guess

49
00:03:36,041 --> 00:03:37,721
Who led you to find your grandson

50
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:40,920
I'll tell you the whereabouts of the imperial grandson

51
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:41,841
Lady Jiang

52
00:03:42,121 --> 00:03:43,041
She's the only one here who knows

53
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:46,800
Impossible

54
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,920
As long as the price is right

55
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,721
What can't you sell

56
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,800
All kinds of things yesterday, such as dying yesterday

57
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,041
This life

58
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,480
Let's leave it like that

59
00:04:15,161 --> 00:04:15,960
Don't look back

60
00:04:16,761 --> 00:04:17,520
Don't see each other

61
00:05:05,761 --> 00:05:06,520
Jiang Niangzi

62
00:05:12,921 --> 00:05:14,481
This is the jade pendant my grandmother gave me

63
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:16,080
Let me give a

64
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:17,720
A woman who wants to be with her all her life

65
00:05:18,881 --> 00:05:19,881
Actually, it should have been given to you

66
00:05:20,801 --> 00:05:21,361
Sorry

67
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,280
The time has not passed

68
00:05:29,321 --> 00:05:29,960
Not too late

69
00:05:44,801 --> 00:05:45,960
Lady Jiang said last time

70
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:49,040
Like someone is like the sun, moon and stars

71
00:05:49,361 --> 00:05:50,321
Out of reach

72
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,361
But I think

73
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:56,561
The stars at this moment

74
00:05:57,640 --> 00:05:58,600
Close at hand

75
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:08,561
Stars fall into the earth

76
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:10,640
I am willing to take it with myself

77
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:24,761
Cui Yongzi

78
00:07:25,321 --> 00:07:26,640
Didn't I ask you to go back

79
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,160
I want to stay a little longer

80
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:30,561
Shen Que

81
00:07:33,361 --> 00:07:34,441
What happened

82
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,881
Failed to help your fiance get rid of me

83
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,481
Very disappointed

84
00:07:41,921 --> 00:07:42,881
What are you talking about

85
00:07:43,640 --> 00:07:44,720
So you yesterday

86
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,040
Heart-punishing words

87
00:07:46,361 --> 00:07:47,481
Every sentence is sincere

88
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,720
What the hell happened

89
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:51,481
Why be hypocritical

90
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:53,520
It's better to be frank

91
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:56,200
How do you do whatever it takes?

92
00:07:57,001 --> 00:07:58,481
I I didn't

93
00:08:00,121 --> 00:08:01,561
But I won't let you get what you want

94
00:08:02,361 --> 00:08:03,520
You can't get rid of me

95
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:06,080
I'm gonna make you panic day and night

96
00:08:06,321 --> 00:08:07,481
Born to die

97
00:08:07,881 --> 00:08:09,600
There will be no peace forever

98
00:08:09,881 --> 00:08:11,400
You can't marry Choi You-an tomorrow

99
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:15,280
I will stay with you until I die

100
00:08:29,441 --> 00:08:30,160
a form of address for one's wife

101
00:08:30,801 --> 00:08:32,400
This time has long passed

102
00:08:32,881 --> 00:08:34,681
I'm afraid Bachelor Cui won't come

103
00:08:35,801 --> 00:08:36,921
Impossible

104
00:08:37,681 --> 00:08:38,681
It doesn't make sense

105
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:41,241
My character has not collapsed

106
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:43,361
How could Choi Woo-an not choose me

107
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:45,721
Prime Minister's Banquet

108
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:47,481
Block the arrow for him and fall

109
00:08:48,761 --> 00:08:50,121
The development of the plot is right

110
00:08:50,761 --> 00:08:52,440
Starting to talk nonsense again

111
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,961
The beginning of the novel

112
00:08:54,761 --> 00:08:58,001
Choi You-an hated Jiang Song

113
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,800
Why is it not

114
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:04,640
Is it because I'm disfigured

115
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:05,961
disfigure

116
00:09:07,881 --> 00:09:08,400
Cui

117
00:09:10,241 --> 00:09:11,160
What are you doing

118
00:09:11,481 --> 00:09:12,361
Who are you

119
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,160
Where are you taking me

120
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,241
Mammy Kim

121
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,241
The happy sedan chair will pass through the cliff mountains in the city

122
00:09:25,241 --> 00:09:26,241
Good life is ready

123
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:48,640
Congratulations to Mrs. Jiang for getting what she wanted

124
00:09:49,601 --> 00:09:50,721
Thank you, Sister Kim

125
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,201
Lady Jiang, please drink this bowl of bitter tea for improving eyesight

126
00:09:59,361 --> 00:10:02,601
Once you enter the prime minister's palace, you must observe your words and feelings

127
00:10:03,001 --> 00:10:04,560
Hold your mouth and tongue

128
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,640
Send Lady Jiang on the sedan chair

129
00:10:33,841 --> 00:10:36,121
Quickly inform the lord that someone is robbing her marriage

130
00:10:36,280 --> 00:10:36,761
Yes

131
00:10:58,841 --> 00:11:00,121
Jiang Niangzi General He

132
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:05,520
Go tell the general

133
00:11:05,520 --> 00:11:06,680
There are two brides in the wedding chair

134
00:11:06,841 --> 00:11:07,280
Yes

135
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:20,520
Mammy Kim

136
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:22,680
Who is this guy

137
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,920
Why are you wearing the exact same wedding dress as me

138
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,241
Getting on my wedding sedan

139
00:11:32,121 --> 00:11:33,160
Thanks to you

140
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,320
I've got a better face

141
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,361
It's a pity

142
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,361
Still three points similar to you

143
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,201
Jiang Jiaojiao

144
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:50,160
Jiang Song

145
00:11:50,721 --> 00:11:52,440
Who can get on the sedan chair of the Prime Minister's mansion

146
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:54,001
It's the Prime Minister who has the final say

147
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:02,961
What do you mean, Prime Minister

148
00:12:03,121 --> 00:12:04,040
Jiang Jiaojiao

149
00:12:04,241 --> 00:12:06,121
Zhao Chengze has been confirmed by Shen

150
00:12:06,601 --> 00:12:07,961
Brought it back to the palace

151
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,920
I was framed

152
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:12,680
And even if the imperial grandson returns to the palace

153
00:12:12,841 --> 00:12:15,081
The Third Prince is also destined to ascend to the throne

154
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:15,961
You believe me

155
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,241
I can predict the future

156
00:12:17,361 --> 00:12:18,160
Knowing the past

157
00:12:22,680 --> 00:12:24,761
Do you think I'll still believe you

158
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,081
You and Your Majesty thirty years ago

159
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,440
Agreement at the top of Mount Tai

160
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:32,761
Following Emperor Taizong Wei Gong as a wise monarch and a good prime minister

161
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,160
Don't you remember

162
00:12:36,040 --> 00:12:37,800
No wonder he wants to protect you

163
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,160
Who

164
00:12:40,481 --> 00:12:41,241
Jiang Jiaojiao

165
00:12:41,721 --> 00:12:43,241
On the sedan chair tomorrow

166
00:12:44,081 --> 00:12:45,001
It will be you

167
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,280
Really

168
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,361
But why me

169
00:12:52,961 --> 00:12:54,320
You've met a noble man

170
00:12:55,721 --> 00:12:56,520
Noble person

171
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:01,520
Thank you, Prime Minister Cui

172
00:13:04,841 --> 00:13:05,680
Who are you

173
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:09,440
What a mess

174
00:13:10,361 --> 00:13:13,560
The heroine of this world has fallen to this point

175
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:17,520
How do you know

176
00:13:19,201 --> 00:13:20,280
What the hell are you

177
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:21,841
It's not important

178
00:13:22,761 --> 00:13:24,920
What matters is what you want

179
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:26,361
I can help you

180
00:13:26,361 --> 00:13:27,361
Can you help me

181
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:28,520
Right

182
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,320
What do you want

183
00:13:32,841 --> 00:13:33,640
I want to

184
00:13:36,201 --> 00:13:37,280
I want to be more beautiful

185
00:13:37,881 --> 00:13:40,001
I will lose because of this scar

186
00:13:40,481 --> 00:13:41,721
It's because I'm not beautiful enough

187
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:43,040
Every time you look in the mirror

188
00:13:44,081 --> 00:13:45,481
I seem to be looking at her

189
00:13:46,081 --> 00:13:47,201
I hate this face

190
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:49,560
I want to be more beautiful

191
00:13:50,241 --> 00:13:51,481
I want to be more beautiful than she is

192
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,640
Can you please help me

193
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,320
Of course you can

194
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,841
I even

195
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:03,320
Can give you a different look

196
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:10,481
Do you make up your mind

197
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:17,680
The heroine must be the most beautiful

198
00:14:18,841 --> 00:14:19,481
Right?

199
00:14:26,121 --> 00:14:27,400
What a madman

200
00:14:27,761 --> 00:14:29,201
That's all because of you

201
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:31,920
If you had listened to my words and followed Zhang San

202
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:35,040
You wouldn't die here

203
00:14:35,721 --> 00:14:36,440
Death

204
00:14:50,001 --> 00:14:51,121
It's you

205
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:19,040
Ginger

206
00:15:33,881 --> 00:15:34,520
Shen Que

207
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,440
What do you do

208
00:15:35,601 --> 00:15:36,481
What do I do

209
00:15:36,841 --> 00:15:38,361
You didn't even know the bride was switched

210
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,961
Who are you

211
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:47,440
Choi You-an

212
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:50,920
You see my face is much more beautiful, right

213
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:52,721
Jiang Jiaojiao

214
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:57,961
Where's Jiang Song

215
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:02,680
Don't you even ask me what happened to my face

216
00:16:04,481 --> 00:16:05,961
It hurts to change your face

217
00:16:07,761 --> 00:16:08,680
What did you do to her

218
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:10,800
You make me look like a perpetrator

219
00:16:10,881 --> 00:16:12,640
I didn't touch a single hair on her

220
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,040
She's the evil one, okay

221
00:16:14,761 --> 00:16:15,560
Where is she

222
00:16:19,081 --> 00:16:20,361
Sister Kim says she'll take care of it

223
00:16:20,721 --> 00:16:21,440
I don't know

224
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:26,201
There seems to be movement in the box over there

225
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:23,161
Just because of our friendship

226
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,161
How dare I drink what you give me

227
00:17:45,921 --> 00:17:46,600
Run
