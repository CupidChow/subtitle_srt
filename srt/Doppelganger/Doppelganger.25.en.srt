1
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:51,040
Dr. Li

2
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:52,400
General, how's it going

3
00:00:53,439 --> 00:00:55,400
I'll give the general a few needles first

4
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:56,280
Okay

5
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:59,199
Look at my memory

6
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,479
I forgot my needle

7
00:01:00,839 --> 00:01:03,320
Would you please go to the clinic and get the needle for me

8
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:04,159
Good

9
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,400
As a rescue doctor

10
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,199
How can you kill someone

11
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,880
I killed the man who deserved to be killed

12
00:01:22,919 --> 00:01:23,880
How dare you be presumptuous

13
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:25,839
Zhang Chao, do you remember

14
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,320
At the beginning, someone in Tuoling Village harbored Hu people's spies

15
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:31,719
You killed the whole village

16
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,800
To make an example

17
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:33,680
My daughter is among them

18
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:34,479
My daughter is among them

19
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:36,199
And her eight-year-old son

20
00:01:36,559 --> 00:01:38,760
And so many innocent people

21
00:01:39,160 --> 00:01:40,520
What's the harm in remembering

22
00:01:40,839 --> 00:01:42,559
This general killed so many people

23
00:01:43,279 --> 00:01:44,719
Don't care a few more of them

24
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,680
Good and evil are rewarded

25
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,880
Even if I can't kill my enemy today

26
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:51,800
Your body won't survive a few days

27
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,520
At least you'll die before General Ben

28
00:01:57,199 --> 00:01:57,839
Shen Que

29
00:01:58,359 --> 00:01:59,119
Kill him

30
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,600
Do it

31
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:04,880
adoptive mother

32
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:06,320
He is skilled in medicine

33
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:07,960
It's better to join the army

34
00:02:08,919 --> 00:02:10,639
Do you think I deserve to die

35
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:12,240
Not

36
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:15,000
The child's life was given by his adoptive father

37
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,399
It's not just your life

38
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:18,560
Would you be where you are today if it weren't for me

39
00:02:18,679 --> 00:02:20,120
Now this man is trying to kill me

40
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:21,639
How should you do it

41
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:33,320
Zhang Chao, you must die a good death

42
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:34,160
You have to die well

43
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,560
If the aliens are not eliminated, our dynasty will be in danger

44
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,079
Zhang Chao must not be relentless

45
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:46,079
Don't kill me

46
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,160
Slow

47
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,840
Let it go

48
00:02:58,359 --> 00:02:58,880
adoptive mother

49
00:03:03,679 --> 00:03:05,199
What's going on with the Prime Minister

50
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:08,320
His Majesty placed him under house arrest in the name of recuperation

51
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:09,479
Send someone to keep an eye on it

52
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,079
I'm in Beijing

53
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,840
Li Dacheng training troops at Dongda Camp

54
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:19,720
They can't afford to make any storms

55
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:21,959
To be foolproof

56
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:23,760
The Yunyong Order must be found as soon as possible

57
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:24,720
Convict them

58
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:27,000
Tomorrow is the Lantern Festival

59
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Watch them

60
00:03:29,679 --> 00:03:30,399
Yes

61
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,679
adoptive mother

62
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:36,919
After Shangyuan

63
00:03:38,600 --> 00:03:39,600
I want to get married

64
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,720
That's all

65
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:47,519
I was afraid she would drag you down

66
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,359
Now that you have made up your mind

67
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:52,000
I have nothing to hide

68
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:53,479
in those days

69
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,880
Actually, she asked me to save you

70
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:57,479
what

71
00:03:58,359 --> 00:03:59,679
She just stabbed you

72
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:03,040
My reinforcements beat away the rebels

73
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,440
She carried you behind her back

74
00:04:04,440 --> 00:04:06,679
Running with my team all day and night

75
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,880
Want me to save you

76
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,280
And said you know some kung fu

77
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,320
Get down on your knees and beg me to keep you

78
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,519
She knows that she's harmed you

79
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:17,199
Let me not mention her in your presence

80
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,360
Why are you here

81
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,719
What's wrong

82
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,719
Nothing

83
00:04:58,719 --> 00:04:59,920
Just wanted to come and see you

84
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:13,760
later

85
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,199
I won't let you go again

86
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,159
Don't think about the future

87
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:36,240
It's fine now

88
00:05:43,159 --> 00:05:44,639
Tomorrow is the Shangyuan Festival

89
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,399
I hope nothing happens

90
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,719
You'll stay at home these days

91
00:05:50,120 --> 00:05:51,159
There are seedlings and flowers they take care of you

92
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,320
I feel more at ease

93
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,320
But I'm still worried

94
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:56,760
Rest assured

95
00:05:57,039 --> 00:05:58,440
They haven't found Cloud Chung Ling yet

96
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,519
Can't move the night walker

97
00:05:59,920 --> 00:06:00,599
I can hold up

98
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,360
What's wrong

99
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:14,360
Nothing

100
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,839
Have it with me

101
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,639
Just like you were by my side

102
00:06:24,159 --> 00:06:24,839
go

103
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,079
Shen Que

104
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:29,399
I'll wait for you

105
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,360
Wait for me

106
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:00,079
They have been playing chess for the past two days

107
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,399
It doesn't seem strange

108
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:02,920
No one enters or leaves

109
00:07:06,399 --> 00:07:07,399
They didn't say anything

110
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:08,480
no

111
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:12,320
What does this taste like

112
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,120
This smell seems to have been smelled somewhere

113
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,240
Magic fragrance again

114
00:07:39,719 --> 00:07:40,519
What is this

115
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,519
Jiang Niangzi

116
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:12,360
Miaohua

117
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:14,039
What's happening out there

118
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:16,039
Many people came out of nowhere

119
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:17,399
Heading towards the palace

120
00:08:18,159 --> 00:08:19,120
But the night walker

121
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:20,599
General Jiang Niangzi said

122
00:08:20,599 --> 00:08:21,599
To protect you

123
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:33,839
I'll have a look

124
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:41,679
Miaohua

125
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:47,439
Finally waited until the finale of the story

126
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:49,159
Jiang Jiaojiao

127
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:51,480
I'm not Jiang Jiaojiao

128
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,000
You'll be soon

129
00:08:54,639 --> 00:08:56,519
In fact, even Qiqi doesn't know

130
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:59,399
Night Walker Split in Two

131
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:03,399
Half listen to the clouds' orders

132
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,480
The other half listens to the wind

133
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,039
The wind commanded

134
00:09:11,679 --> 00:09:13,360
It's in the hands of the Prime Minister

135
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:15,720
You mean

136
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,240
Only half of the night walkers are making trouble now

137
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:20,080
right

138
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:21,760
Wait until you find the Yunyong Order

139
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:23,480
Choi You'an is stable

140
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,519
It's up to you

141
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,399
Is it my business

142
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:30,080
Jiang Song couldn't find Yunyong Ling

143
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:32,480
But Jiang Jiaojiao knew its whereabouts

144
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,039
Don't you remember anything yet

145
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:51,000
I can't think of anything

146
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,919
You're too stubborn

147
00:09:57,439 --> 00:09:58,720
Actually you know me

148
00:09:58,919 --> 00:10:00,519
How could I know you

149
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:03,120
You've known me a long, long time

150
00:10:06,559 --> 00:10:08,279
A little butterfly

151
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:11,200
Fly over Guanyin Bridge

152
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,240
Are you that escape bride

153
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,159
When I got out of town

154
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:38,760
Still nowhere to go

155
00:10:39,919 --> 00:10:41,240
It was God who saved me

156
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:43,439
Put on this mask

157
00:10:46,679 --> 00:10:48,080
I have a new life

158
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,880
You killed yourself in exchange for survival

159
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:57,200
No wonder you insisted on letting me be Jiang Jiaojiao

160
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,600
Isn't it good to be Jiang Jiaojiao

161
00:11:00,799 --> 00:11:01,559
look

162
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,919
So many people died

163
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,279
A city is in chaos

164
00:11:06,799 --> 00:11:08,399
A dynasty died

165
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,279
Just to fight for you

166
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:12,919
Just for your love story

167
00:11:12,919 --> 00:11:14,480
Thrilling enough

168
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:34,840
So many people died

169
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:37,200
Is it all because of me

170
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:39,760
NO

171
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,240
It's not true

172
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:42,720
It's a nightmare

173
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,360
NO

174
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,880
It's all a nightmare

175
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:06,720
look

176
00:12:08,319 --> 00:12:10,039
This is the heroine's world

177
00:12:11,679 --> 00:12:12,760
No killing

178
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:13,760
Suffering

179
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:14,880
ugly

180
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,760
Only flowers

181
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:20,279
The man who loves you shelters you from the wind and rain

182
00:12:20,559 --> 00:12:21,720
Holding you in the palm of my hand

183
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:26,039
You just have to be Jiaojiao

184
00:12:45,399 --> 00:12:47,840
You can choose to be crushed by that cruel truth

185
00:12:48,439 --> 00:12:49,120
You can also choose

186
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:51,000
Don't look at what's hidden under the petals

187
00:12:52,519 --> 00:12:54,039
Why do you bother with yourself

188
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,399
Jiang Song

189
00:13:10,039 --> 00:13:11,000
Jiang Jiaojiao

190
00:13:15,159 --> 00:13:16,039
very good

191
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:18,240
You are Jiang Jiaojiao

192
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:20,159
Think about it

193
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,519
Where is the cloud order

194
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:33,360
Don't worry, Your Highness

195
00:13:33,799 --> 00:13:35,240
The villain must set up the young emperor's grandson

196
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:36,679
Chengze

197
00:13:37,159 --> 00:13:38,559
You were born in the imperial house

198
00:13:39,960 --> 00:13:42,760
I hope you can live safely in the future

199
00:13:47,919 --> 00:13:48,960
This bamboo flute

200
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,880
Remember not to fall into someone else's hands

201
00:13:53,519 --> 00:13:55,439
Maybe wait until the clouds clear and the fog clears

202
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:57,760
Can it help you

203
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,840
I seem to remember

204
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:07,480
Where

205
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,880
Cloud Chung Order

206
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:14,760
On Zhao Chengze

207
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:17,720
So nice
