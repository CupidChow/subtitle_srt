1
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:50,960
Agate bracelet with seven strings

2
00:00:51,159 --> 00:00:52,360
Ten gold ingots

3
00:00:54,159 --> 00:00:55,360
Three enamel bracelets

4
00:00:55,519 --> 00:00:56,680
Eight strings of crystal agate

5
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,919
Twenty pairs of gemstones and gold hairpins

6
00:01:03,919 --> 00:01:05,080
What are you doing here

7
00:01:05,559 --> 00:01:06,879
I'm afraid I'm not coveting the prime minister's mansion

8
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,360
A dowry for my wife

9
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,080
Your wife's dowry

10
00:01:10,760 --> 00:01:12,040
Too much grab things

11
00:01:12,639 --> 00:01:15,600
I forgot who the shameless fake is

12
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:16,160
You

13
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,680
May I ask Miss Jiang

14
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,479
Bachelor Cui Bachelor Cui

15
00:01:19,919 --> 00:01:21,919
You must have come to see my wife

16
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:28,400
Could you please have Mrs. Jiang

17
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:33,880
Jiang Niangzi

18
00:01:34,639 --> 00:01:35,760
The ointment is very good at healing wounds

19
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,040
You might as well try

20
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:40,440
Thank you, Master Cui

21
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:47,440
Young Master Cui said

22
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:49,600
I made the lotus pond fish cakes

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:51,320
Much like the craft of an old friend of yours

24
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,240
So I did some

25
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,479
Don't you like it

26
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:02,600
no

27
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:03,839
I like it very much

28
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,760
Clean your hands

29
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,400
no

30
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,320
By the way

31
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:45,760
On the way here

32
00:02:46,479 --> 00:02:47,679
I bought a hairpin by the way

33
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:48,959
It suits you

34
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:53,079
How about that young master put it on for me

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:57,600
Good

36
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,639
I once asked you before the temple

37
00:03:11,479 --> 00:03:12,560
I want to ask again

38
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,359
Marry me

39
00:03:17,679 --> 00:03:18,880
You really don't mind

40
00:03:20,399 --> 00:03:21,199
Jiang Niangzi

41
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:23,280
I

42
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:24,840
Young Master's little kindness

43
00:03:25,199 --> 00:03:26,519
Became my ladder

44
00:03:28,600 --> 00:03:30,919
I'm supposed to be smug

45
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:33,720
But a gentleman's meaning should not be used

46
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,760
You really don't mind our start

47
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:43,959
a form of address for one's wife

48
00:03:44,639 --> 00:03:45,320
Young Master

49
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:47,639
Young master, can you lend me to hide for a while

50
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,479
Zhang San which Zhang San

51
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,040
The effect of the medicine hasn't come up yet

52
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:52,120
What are you in a hurry

53
00:03:52,359 --> 00:03:53,440
Doesn't that let her run away

54
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,760
I'm not afraid that Jiaojiao will not be willing

55
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:55,840
Want to hurry up

56
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,440
You chase it quickly

57
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:09,000
Ma'am, are you okay

58
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,560
It's okay

59
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:20,239
Thank you young master

60
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:22,000
Who is chasing the wife

61
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:23,959
Yes

62
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,480
It's my uncle

63
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:30,320
He drugged me and forced me

64
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,240
To sell me to someone else

65
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:34,519
It's unreasonable

66
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,680
The emperor forced the people's daughters under his feet

67
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,199
Is there no king law in their eyes

68
00:04:41,519 --> 00:04:44,360
Young master must be out of the height family

69
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:45,760
No wonder I know

70
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,839
The so-called king law

71
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:50,599
Bless the powerful

72
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:53,399
Don't protect the common people

73
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,560
You're uncomfortable

74
00:05:02,519 --> 00:05:03,399
I'll get you a towel

75
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:05,399
Thank you so much

76
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:12,920
Zhang San will never give up

77
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,199
This person must have a lot of background

78
00:05:15,599 --> 00:05:16,880
Zhang San dare not offend him

79
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,360
Instead of being spoiled by Zhang San

80
00:05:20,159 --> 00:05:20,880
As good as

81
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:50,760
a form of address for one's wife

82
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,399
Female and female are not close

83
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,039
This is unreasonable

84
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,639
It is really unreasonable

85
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,360
I am sorry

86
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,639
If I offend you again

87
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,079
Lady doesn't need to show mercy

88
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,440
Lord

89
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,079
get out

90
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,440
Go quick

91
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,039
Even if the young master doesn't care about the starting point

92
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,399
So am I the one you want to get to the end

93
00:06:58,599 --> 00:06:59,199
I

94
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,639
I don't like Jiang Jiaojiao

95
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:03,839
But hatred is hatred

96
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:04,880
Yeah yes

97
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:07,839
I hope you find someone you really love

98
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:10,800
Do you like her

99
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,760
Ashamed to say

100
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:16,839
I have been dull and ignorant since childhood

101
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:20,480
I don't know how it feels to like someone

102
00:07:22,519 --> 00:07:23,599
Like someone

103
00:07:24,079 --> 00:07:25,680
He's the one who once shone light on you

104
00:07:26,599 --> 00:07:27,639
For the rest of my life

105
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,399
The stars are him

106
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,000
The moon is him

107
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:33,959
The sun is him too

108
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,760
But the sun, moon and stars are out of reach

109
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,039
Yeah

110
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:44,920
So they should hang high in the sky

111
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,279
The one who pulled me back to the world

112
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:49,639
Why can't I trust her again

113
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:52,599
Tell me the answer

114
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:54,920
Instead of

115
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,599
Caught by vines in the mud

116
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:04,480
Cui Yongzi

117
00:08:04,959 --> 00:08:05,839
Two days to go

118
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,360
I hope you can think through it

119
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,279
Who is the person who wants to join hands for life

120
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:11,279
Is it okay

121
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:12,639
Jiang Niangzi

122
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:13,560
If you select me

123
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:15,240
Tomorrow's time

124
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:17,599
See you in Yingyuewan

125
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,440
Choi You-an

126
00:08:31,839 --> 00:08:32,480
Choi You-an

127
00:08:36,079 --> 00:08:37,639
You've come to my house

128
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:39,480
Why don't you come and see me

129
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,279
Why doesn't the lady recover well

130
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,399
You still care about me, don't you

131
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,319
I

132
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:49,200
Choi You-an, look at me

133
00:08:50,439 --> 00:08:51,480
You look at me

134
00:08:54,559 --> 00:08:55,399
Jiang Niangzi

135
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,360
Although you are strict in doing things

136
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,519
But you'll put up with me if I mess around

137
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,519
You'll worry about me when I get hurt

138
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,559
I'm definitely gonna mess you up

139
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,439
You clearly like me

140
00:09:07,880 --> 00:09:09,159
So you don't like her, right

141
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:13,080
Can a loveless marriage be happy

142
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,600
Excuse me for something important to do

143
00:09:17,159 --> 00:09:18,360
I'll see my wife another day

144
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,559
No, you can't go

145
00:09:20,519 --> 00:09:21,600
Love is free

146
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,679
Marriage is autonomous

147
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,399
Can you be bold

148
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:25,679
Be brave for love

149
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,000
Ma'am, what's wrong with you

150
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:39,439
I'll wait for you until tomorrow

151
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,639
I won't take a bite of the medicine until you come

152
00:09:47,319 --> 00:09:48,159
a form of address for one's wife

153
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:50,319
Ma'am, why are you coughing up blood Ma'am

154
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,200
a form of address for one's wife

155
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,159
a form of address for one's wife

156
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,679
If the capital had not fallen back then

157
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:06,000
Perhaps

158
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,159
You are going to marry General Shen now

159
00:10:08,319 --> 00:10:09,319
It doesn't have to be like today

160
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:10,200
No if

161
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,919
Seven seven

162
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,919
Life seems to have thousands of choices

163
00:10:16,559 --> 00:10:18,200
But when you go to the back, you will find

164
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,880
There's always one way to go

165
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:21,960
So don't look back

166
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:24,000
Shen Que and I

167
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,319
Already embarked on two opposite paths

168
00:10:29,439 --> 00:10:30,319
Went the wrong way

169
00:10:30,639 --> 00:10:31,760
Why can't you go back

170
00:10:33,120 --> 00:10:34,279
Who gave you permission

171
00:10:35,919 --> 00:10:36,600
get out

172
00:10:44,919 --> 00:10:45,960
This is my boudoir

173
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:47,360
I'm getting married

174
00:10:47,679 --> 00:10:49,519
You break in and you're shameless

175
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:53,760
don't

176
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:56,960
Seven seven

177
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,840
Help me get rid of him

178
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:00,960
I

179
00:11:04,639 --> 00:11:05,240
Good

180
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,840
If you don't go, I'll go

181
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,639
Let go

182
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:14,039
Let go Shen Que

183
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,319
What are you trying to do

184
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,840
Why do you have to marry him

185
00:11:23,319 --> 00:11:24,080
Still need to ask

186
00:11:26,240 --> 00:11:28,919
Glory and wealth

187
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:36,720
You're not such a person

188
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,120
You won't sell yourself out

189
00:11:46,519 --> 00:11:47,319
General Shen

190
00:11:48,559 --> 00:11:50,360
What kind of person am I

191
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,919
Do you know how much I can sell it

192
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,679
Let me tell you

193
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:01,439
You go out and go west to the vegetable market

194
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,439
Come on

195
00:12:03,559 --> 00:12:04,720
Your father died

196
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,120
Your brother is still young

197
00:12:06,439 --> 00:12:07,960
I'm your uncle

198
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:11,240
Who can say no if I sell you

199
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:13,279
look

200
00:12:14,639 --> 00:12:16,000
A woman

201
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,519
It can only be sold for five or six taels of silver

202
00:12:20,319 --> 00:12:24,319
A woman can only sell five or six taels of silver

203
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,600
Jiang Niangzi

204
00:12:25,840 --> 00:12:27,120
You followed Zhang San

205
00:12:27,559 --> 00:12:30,120
Get a hundred taels of silver

206
00:12:30,439 --> 00:12:32,399
As long as the price is right

207
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:34,519
What can't you sell

208
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,279
Women's marriage

209
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:38,159
The head of the family has the final say

210
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,439
You sold a lot of money to be satisfied

211
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,760
You know, as a woman

212
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:48,679
Can choose who to sell to

213
00:12:48,679 --> 00:12:50,600
Is it a great luck already

214
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,200
All my life

215
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:55,120
Been sold too many times

216
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:56,720
Been a daughter

217
00:12:58,039 --> 00:12:58,960
Concubine

218
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:00,919
Mother

219
00:13:01,720 --> 00:13:02,519
This time

220
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:04,880
Finally being myself

221
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,880
In the final analysis

222
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:15,319
Don't you also work for your foster father

223
00:13:16,039 --> 00:13:17,120
Pour a cavity of blood

224
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,760
Strive for some fame and fortune

225
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,720
I worked for peace in the world

226
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,000
Four seasons are stable

227
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,279
So that wherever you are

228
00:13:28,919 --> 00:13:30,120
Don't be afraid

229
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,200
Believe it or not

230
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,439
All these years, I climbed out of the mountain of corpses and the sea of blood

231
00:13:35,919 --> 00:13:37,240
Not for the reward of the emperor

232
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:39,360
Instead want to

233
00:13:42,039 --> 00:13:42,960
Want to hear you say

234
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:45,919
Want to hear you say

235
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:46,679
General Shen

236
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:50,319
You think highly of me

237
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:53,039
You underestimated yourself

238
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:54,840
It was because of you that I

239
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,639
It was because I was so stupid

240
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:58,960
I can't even take care of myself

241
00:13:58,960 --> 00:14:00,000
And to take care of others

242
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,159
General Shen

243
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,319
You go to that high place

244
00:14:10,559 --> 00:14:11,919
Like the sun and moon shining brightly

245
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:13,519
Admired by all the people

246
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,480
And the women of the people

247
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:18,279
Greedy in this mud

248
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,120
No, all kinds of things like yesterday, such as dying yesterday

249
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,279
Let's do this for this life

250
00:14:28,439 --> 00:14:30,319
Don't look back, don't see each other

251
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,840
Don't dirty your Qingyun Road

252
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:34,319
Please also

253
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,080
Don't disturb my dream of wealth

254
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,720
If you insist on marrying him

255
00:14:54,279 --> 00:14:55,000
Whatever it is

256
00:14:56,159 --> 00:14:57,159
When I find the imperial grandson

257
00:14:57,919 --> 00:14:58,880
Get the tiger talisman

258
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:01,399
I will go back to the frontier

259
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:03,799
A narrow escape

260
00:15:04,799 --> 00:15:07,639
At least he can stay with you for a long time

261
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:10,799
Jiang Song

262
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,319
Happy wedding

263
00:15:22,439 --> 00:15:25,279
This is what I have saved over the years

264
00:15:27,279 --> 00:15:28,080
I was thinking

265
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:32,279
Forget it, it's not important

266
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:34,559
I hope you will

267
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,319
You can protect yourself

268
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:40,080
And someone you care about

269
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:49,080
If I don't die

270
00:15:49,919 --> 00:15:50,720
I'll see you again

271
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:14,600
Shen Que

272
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:21,720
Don't tell me about the funeral

273
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,519
To live

274
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,439
I know you want military power

275
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,799
Protect mountains and rivers

276
00:16:32,799 --> 00:16:34,039
If I can help you

277
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:36,960
I'll tell you the whereabouts of the imperial grandson

278
00:16:37,840 --> 00:16:38,600
How do you know

279
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:39,720
You don't have to worry about that

280
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,000
I just hope

281
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:44,120
The tragedy of the fall of the capital will not happen again

282
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,240
I believe you can do it

283
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,640
The dog swallowed a copper coin she dropped

284
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,480
She kept the dog all day for this

285
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:20,079
Just a copper coin is so shabby

286
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:23,640
She is famous for her love of money in this world

287
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,240
Walk walk walk

288
00:17:29,359 --> 00:17:30,279
It's a little hot

289
00:17:30,279 --> 00:17:31,920
Why don't you go home and wait

290
00:17:47,480 --> 00:17:48,720
You go to a shady place to rest

291
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:49,879
I stared at it

292
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:04,720
What's wrong

293
00:18:05,839 --> 00:18:06,680
So happy

294
00:18:07,599 --> 00:18:08,240
of course

295
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,839
I won't go hungry with money

296
00:18:12,319 --> 00:18:14,039
You can also be less bullied

297
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,359
Money

298
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:18,359
Can protect myself and

299
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:24,680
People I care about

300
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:51,879
Where's my hairpin

301
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,680
It's ugly
