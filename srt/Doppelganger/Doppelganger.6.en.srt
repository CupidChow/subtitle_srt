1
00:01:49,639 --> 00:01:50,359
Amo

2
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:52,479
Since when did there begonia

3
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,320
You always have begonia in your yard

4
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,040
It blooms at this time of year

5
00:02:00,279 --> 00:02:01,919
That cyclamen and purple cloud vine over there

6
00:02:02,839 --> 00:02:03,680
And goldfish

7
00:02:04,440 --> 00:02:05,279
Has it always been

8
00:02:06,839 --> 00:02:07,479
Yeah

9
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,279
Always have

10
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:13,680
Why didn't I find it

11
00:02:14,279 --> 00:02:16,479
All these years, General, you have lived so unpopular

12
00:02:16,679 --> 00:02:18,359
Everyone else enjoys wine, money and beauty

13
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,639
But you are determined to kill the enemy

14
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:20,880
Nothing is on the eye

15
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,040
Even if it's your own house

16
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:23,199
Not even looking at it

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,280
but

18
00:02:25,679 --> 00:02:27,040
Why did you pay attention tonight

19
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:27,959
I

20
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:28,519
stupid

21
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,519
Because there are more people in the family

22
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:34,199
What do you mean

23
00:02:36,399 --> 00:02:37,040
By the way General

24
00:02:37,479 --> 00:02:38,679
What to do with that woman

25
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,160
disposition

26
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,239
You taught me

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,000
Don't have mercy on traitors

28
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,840
We must return the other bodies in the other way

29
00:02:45,359 --> 00:02:46,160
Why don't we take her

30
00:02:47,679 --> 00:02:48,560
I taught you, too

31
00:02:49,679 --> 00:02:50,639
Take care of your knife

32
00:02:50,799 --> 00:02:52,120
Make a decision after figuring everything out

33
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,519
Shen Que

34
00:03:32,399 --> 00:03:33,079
You're awake

35
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,160
You

36
00:03:37,720 --> 00:03:38,919
Take care of me all night

37
00:03:41,679 --> 00:03:42,760
No, I just arrived

38
00:03:50,079 --> 00:03:52,840
Then it's time to settle our accounts

39
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:55,720
Where to start

40
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,000
Since I killed you

41
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,440
I stabbed you

42
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,160
It's time to pay the debt with blood

43
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,359
I just want an answer

44
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,720
what

45
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:11,120
You were

46
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:12,799
Do you really want me dead

47
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:16,000
When the rebels rebelled

48
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:16,919
Fall of the capital

49
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,840
Your brother fell to the rebels

50
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:23,440
Cricket

51
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,079
Where's the cricket

52
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:28,920
be careful

53
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:31,639
Run Girl

54
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,839
stop

55
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:39,440
Shen Que

56
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,039
Jiang Song

57
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:41,880
Let her go

58
00:04:42,079 --> 00:04:42,959
Little lady

59
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,519
Is this your little beau

60
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,440
Are you trying to make your little beau lose his head

61
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,279
Let's have fun together again

62
00:04:51,599 --> 00:04:54,440
Do you want him to watch us have fun together

63
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:57,519
Let's send you all on the road again

64
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,519
If you touch her, I'll kill you

65
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,920
Pretty tough

66
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:05,639
To live

67
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:07,560
To live

68
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,560
What are you saying

69
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:10,120
I can't hear you

70
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:11,959
I said

71
00:05:14,079 --> 00:05:15,320
What kind of beau is he

72
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,079
Just slaves

73
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,639
The little girl has admired heroes since childhood

74
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:22,279
I hope the general will let me live

75
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:26,000
If the general doesn't believe

76
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,639
As good as

77
00:05:28,599 --> 00:05:30,279
Let the little girl kill him herself

78
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:32,440
As a gift of surrender

79
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:33,560
OK

80
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,240
I'll fulfill you

81
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,199
Someone bring her a knife

82
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,120
Jiang Song

83
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:10,959
Why

84
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,440
Nothing survives me

85
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:15,599
More important

86
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:22,519
When I wake up

87
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:24,639
Already in my foster father's barracks

88
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:26,760
I ask you

89
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,039
Did you really want me dead

90
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,399
Otherwise

91
00:06:36,199 --> 00:06:36,800
NO

92
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,199
When the rebels tried to kill me, I would die

93
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:42,719
But if you move to avoid the vital point

94
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,320
I could still survive, right

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:48,360
You think too much

96
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,480
I just want to live by myself

97
00:06:56,079 --> 00:06:57,320
Once upon a time I was a slave

98
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,760
Long born with no love

99
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,519
But when you said you found me

100
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:06,440
I admit that your hide-and-seek skills have improved

101
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:07,959
But

102
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,360
I'll always find you

103
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,639
You pulled me back into the world

104
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,039
Years after parting

105
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:15,480
I was filled with resentment

106
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:17,320
Every day is like a walking dead

107
00:07:18,039 --> 00:07:18,880
Until last night

108
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:25,560
I saw a tree full of crabapple flowers

109
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,519
I was surprised to realize that my world was back

110
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:30,079
Because

111
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,039
I found you

112
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:36,240
At that moment I asked myself

113
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:38,159
The one who pulled me back to the world

114
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:40,480
Why can't I trust her again

115
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,440
Tell me the answer

116
00:07:49,399 --> 00:07:50,199
Jiang Niangzi

117
00:07:50,279 --> 00:07:51,599
Your grandmother came to take you home

118
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:54,760
I'll ask you

119
00:07:55,560 --> 00:07:57,719
How did you become like this

120
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,519
Frame the younger brother

121
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:00,599
Night stay up

122
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:01,760
Killing by disfigurement

123
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:03,920
What else are you afraid to do

124
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:06,680
Where did my good girl go

125
00:08:07,159 --> 00:08:08,320
Your darling girl

126
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,880
Isn't it at your house

127
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:13,320
And you blame me for keeping her

128
00:08:13,959 --> 00:08:15,480
If I hadn't planned more

129
00:08:16,839 --> 00:08:18,440
How the Jiang family turned over

130
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:21,039
Seeing Yao Zu understand Yuan

131
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,680
You're going to marry into the prime minister's house

132
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,320
But you ruined it all

133
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:27,360
You're the one who ruined it all

134
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,279
And you came to contradict me

135
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,959
Mrs Jiang, please respect yourself

136
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,039
Mrs. Jiang, how can you beat your wife

137
00:08:34,079 --> 00:08:35,599
Do you know how badly she was hurt

138
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:41,319
That's it, that's it

139
00:08:42,439 --> 00:08:44,279
I can't control you anymore

140
00:08:45,679 --> 00:08:47,600
The wedding is in five days

141
00:08:48,159 --> 00:08:50,279
You don't have to show up again

142
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:55,319
You want her to marry me

143
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,559
You don't know clearly with a man now

144
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,360
Abandoned the Jiang family again

145
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,559
This marriage has nothing to do with you

146
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:05,519
Day-dream your dreams

147
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:09,039
The man who married Choi You-an five days later

148
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:10,480
It can only be me

149
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:13,880
I am the one with whom I share three books and six rites

150
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,720
Why let others take it away

151
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,679
The more she wants

152
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,399
The less I will let her

153
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:22,360
I must marry Choi Woo-an

154
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,000
certainly

155
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:36,880
Where is the imperial grandson

156
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,519
Can you say it now

157
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:39,639
No need

158
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,200
Choi You-an

159
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:50,200
This lady

160
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,799
My bride is not you

161
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:57,080
Father

162
00:09:57,639 --> 00:09:58,799
Even if we can't find our imperial grandson

163
00:09:59,439 --> 00:10:00,720
And I wouldn't sacrifice anyone

164
00:10:01,399 --> 00:10:03,559
Make my marriage a deal

165
00:10:11,159 --> 00:10:11,919
Choi You-an

166
00:10:12,799 --> 00:10:13,679
I'm not marrying

167
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,639
I'll tell you the whereabouts of the imperial grandson now

168
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,679
Think of it as my wedding gift

169
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,639
I figured it out

170
00:10:21,319 --> 00:10:22,439
Twisted melons are not sweet

171
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,080
As long as you're happy

172
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:27,200
I'll be content

173
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,600
After the emperor's grandson lived among the people

174
00:10:39,799 --> 00:10:40,760
Alias Zhao Si

175
00:10:41,159 --> 00:10:42,559
Opened a sesame cake shop here

176
00:10:44,799 --> 00:10:45,639
Shopkeeper Zhao

177
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:47,360
There's a visitor

178
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:48,519
Shopkeeper Zhao

179
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:50,679
Shopkeeper Zhao

180
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,600
Shopkeeper Zhao is a visitor

181
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:54,880
Shopkeeper Zhao

182
00:10:55,840 --> 00:10:56,439
And so on

183
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:57,799
Something's wrong

184
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:02,399
I'm rude

185
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,880
Lord, I'll go and see

186
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,159
No one's stuff was emptied

187
00:11:22,319 --> 00:11:24,120
Choi Woo-an, you have to believe me

188
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:25,840
I saw him two days ago

189
00:11:26,039 --> 00:11:27,240
They sell sesame cakes here

190
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:28,319
I'm not lying to you

191
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,200
You believe me

192
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:30,720
I'm really not lying to you

193
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:34,000
Young Master Prime Minister is here

194
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,480
Let me see who of you dares

195
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,360
be careful

196
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,080
Jiang Jiaojiao

197
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,760
Jiang Jiaojiao

198
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:46,960
Choi You-an

199
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:48,399
You believe me

200
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:49,840
I'm really not lying to you

201
00:11:49,840 --> 00:11:51,200
Stop talking, I'll take you to the doctor

202
00:11:51,679 --> 00:11:52,880
You believe me

203
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:54,720
I believe in you I believe in you

204
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,399
Choi Woo-an, I want to tell you a secret

205
00:12:02,679 --> 00:12:04,200
Okay, you talk, I'll listen

206
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:05,319
Don't fall asleep

207
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,639
From the first sight I saw you

208
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,039
I fell in love with you

209
00:12:11,039 --> 00:12:13,319
I really like you so much

210
00:12:14,319 --> 00:12:16,639
Can you try to like me

211
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,559
Try to like me, okay

212
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,200
Bachelor Cui has no need to worry

213
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,240
The arrow missed the point

214
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:43,399
Lang Jun

215
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:45,799
I think she's just playing with us

216
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,679
She didn't know the whereabouts of her grandson

217
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,600
Why don't you skin her off

218
00:12:50,159 --> 00:12:51,240
Throw it out and feed it to the dog

219
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:54,799
Lord

220
00:12:55,319 --> 00:12:56,439
I took someone to inquire

221
00:12:57,319 --> 00:12:58,559
What Jiang Jiaojiao said is true

222
00:12:59,639 --> 00:13:00,399
just

223
00:13:00,919 --> 00:13:02,880
It seems that someone took the imperial grandson two days ago

224
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,760
Almost blamed her wrong

225
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:08,600
actually

226
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,919
Actually, Nineteen wants to say

227
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,679
The lord married Jiang Song for faith

228
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:15,600
But she plotted against you after all

229
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:18,679
And Jiang Jiaojiao risked her life to save you

230
00:13:19,039 --> 00:13:19,799
Lord why

231
00:13:22,039 --> 00:13:23,200
Don't pity those around you

232
00:13:46,799 --> 00:13:47,480
hello

233
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:49,679
May I ask where is the shopkeeper here

234
00:13:49,960 --> 00:13:50,840
He moved away

235
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,960
Moved away

236
00:13:56,039 --> 00:13:57,600
Why did he move away

237
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:11,439
That's wrong

238
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,480
It says on this

239
00:14:14,039 --> 00:14:15,600
Choi Woo-an is the day after

240
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,960
The imperial grandson found here

241
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:18,760
This time hasn't come

242
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,439
Why did he move away

243
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,639
Is Jiang Song not dead

244
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:27,159
Had a butterfly effect on the plot

245
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,159
Now I don't know where the imperial grandson is

246
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,000
How to explain to the Prime Minister

247
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,080
Take a gamble

248
00:14:39,439 --> 00:14:40,319
Wait for the time

249
00:14:40,319 --> 00:14:42,120
I brought Cui You-an into the baked-seed cake shop

250
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,080
Just do it

251
00:14:44,799 --> 00:14:46,439
Then the bitter plan you mentioned

252
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:47,840
How do we cooperate

253
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:48,919
You attacked him

254
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,319
I blocked his knife

255
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,480
But watch out

256
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:52,760
Get gently

257
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,080
Don't be light or heavy

258
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,559
Don't worry, I killed a pig

259
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:57,720
Have a sense of measure

260
00:14:57,760 --> 00:14:58,840
Knife skills are trivial

261
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,919
You better be

262
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,919
Sure enough, all the male protagonists in novels do this

263
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,760
Idiot

264
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,720
We agreed to use a knife

265
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,120
Who told him to use the arrow

266
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:20,919
It hurts me so much

267
00:15:28,919 --> 00:15:29,559
Who

268
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,519
What is it

269
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:12,319
How do you know

270
00:16:15,799 --> 00:16:16,880
You don't know

271
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,760
The man who shoots the arrow

272
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:22,200
I actually arranged it

273
00:16:23,240 --> 00:16:24,600
You still want to kill me

274
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,240
of course

275
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:26,679
You forgot

276
00:16:27,080 --> 00:16:28,080
You can't kill me

277
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,919
Yeah

278
00:16:30,039 --> 00:16:31,799
I can't kill you with my own hands

279
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,360
But can I borrow someone else's hand

280
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:37,679
I want to try

281
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,240
It seems to be ok

282
00:16:43,319 --> 00:16:44,679
It's a pity that it's a little worse

283
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:46,039
By the way

284
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:50,720
Do you know why the imperial grandson suddenly moved

285
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,159
It's you

286
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:03,840
"Pampered"

287
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,519
I always feel that something is wrong with her

288
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,559
It turns out that she has a strange book about predicting the future

289
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,119
Imperial grandson

290
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:20,119
So what you mean

291
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:22,519
The Prime Minister will know I'm here at any time

292
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:23,200
Right

293
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,599
A woman will definitely inform the prime minister

294
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:26,359
Where are you?

295
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,279
Think about it

296
00:17:27,720 --> 00:17:28,760
Except for the third prince

297
00:17:29,240 --> 00:17:31,160
You're the only one who can be the crown prince

298
00:17:31,599 --> 00:17:33,079
They won't let you go

299
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,519
It turns out that all along

300
00:17:36,519 --> 00:17:38,519
You're fighting me with this book

301
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,480
Predict the Future

302
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:45,599
Now that you've seen it

303
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:46,519
You should know

304
00:17:46,519 --> 00:17:48,440
It's all about me

305
00:17:48,879 --> 00:17:49,799
Nothing to do with you

306
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:51,640
It's useless if you take it

307
00:17:52,079 --> 00:17:52,879
Take away

308
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,319
Why do you think so about me

309
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:58,879
Jiaojiao

310
00:17:59,559 --> 00:18:01,200
I already told you

311
00:18:01,599 --> 00:18:05,200
I've never been signed in my life

312
00:18:06,119 --> 00:18:07,319
People can rely on

313
00:18:09,599 --> 00:18:10,799
Only here

314
00:18:13,640 --> 00:18:14,720
The book

315
00:18:15,839 --> 00:18:18,319
It should be your sign

316
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:22,319
don't

317
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:35,119
Predict the Future

318
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,000
Now

319
00:18:47,359 --> 00:18:48,160
It's fair
