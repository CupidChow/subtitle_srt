1
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:50,041
Try hard, madam

2
00:02:43,561 --> 00:02:44,080
go

3
00:02:53,321 --> 00:02:54,321
I don't believe what my mother said

4
00:02:55,841 --> 00:02:57,001
I must escape

5
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,841
So you can even lose your life

6
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,561
Five years ago I might have come with you

7
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,561
But now

8
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,441
I'm going to find myself

9
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:23,721
I've been looking for you all these years

10
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:28,240
In the beginning I wanted to get back at you

11
00:03:29,881 --> 00:03:30,841
Then I panicked

12
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,441
I'm afraid I'm afraid I'll never find you again

13
00:03:36,561 --> 00:03:37,920
But now I found you

14
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,200
I didn't expect you to wait for me anymore

15
00:03:45,841 --> 00:03:46,601
I am sorry

16
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,200
So where are you going

17
00:03:56,121 --> 00:03:57,761
The little butterfly nursery rhyme sings about

18
00:03:58,041 --> 00:03:59,881
Once a bride escaped from town

19
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,161
Some say she became a fairy

20
00:04:02,721 --> 00:04:04,041
Some say she's a ghost

21
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,881
I want to see the answer for myself

22
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,640
What about after escaping the city

23
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,800
Are you sure about the future

24
00:04:12,281 --> 00:04:12,881
of course

25
00:04:16,281 --> 00:04:18,001
As long as you can control your life

26
00:04:19,001 --> 00:04:20,121
I'm sure

27
00:04:24,761 --> 00:04:25,921
This is my daydream

28
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:29,520
I can only believe that there is boundless freedom outside the city

29
00:04:30,441 --> 00:04:32,361
Otherwise, there will be no hope

30
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,321
Shen Que

31
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:37,840
I'm different from you

32
00:04:40,121 --> 00:04:42,040
The moon I've been chasing all my life

33
00:04:42,241 --> 00:04:44,321
Just a moment of sharpness under your blade

34
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,200
You traverse north and south

35
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,600
Have seen the setting sun on the long river

36
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:48,600
Lonely smoke in the desert

37
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:50,280
But my moon

38
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,921
But always framed in a small square patio

39
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,280
Men can study and become officials

40
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,080
Retreat can close the frontier on the battlefield

41
00:04:59,801 --> 00:05:01,520
But I don't want to be a man either

42
00:05:02,681 --> 00:05:03,600
Because women

43
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,960
There should be a woman's way

44
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:09,561
The world has sealed our way

45
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,681
I'll try another one

46
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:21,881
What a pity

47
00:05:24,001 --> 00:05:25,200
Or got caught by you

48
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:30,121
I always seem to be a little out of luck

49
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,121
Jiang Song

50
00:05:46,121 --> 00:05:46,840
You go

51
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,761
Long road ahead

52
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,520
Since you decided to walk alone

53
00:05:53,481 --> 00:05:54,280
I won't send it then

54
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,960
It won't be any worse this time

55
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,681
Go and catch your moon

56
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,600
Thank you

57
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:15,681
Actually, I never figured it out

58
00:06:16,761 --> 00:06:17,840
I was trying to find you

59
00:06:18,441 --> 00:06:19,681
Or give yourself an explanation

60
00:06:21,481 --> 00:06:22,160
You're right

61
00:06:23,361 --> 00:06:24,520
I have everything in the future

62
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:26,441
Why cling to you

63
00:06:27,881 --> 00:06:28,720
People change

64
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,400
But Shen Que five years ago

65
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:34,040
You don't want me to keep you

66
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:41,720
treasure

67
00:06:48,361 --> 00:06:48,960
treasure

68
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Lord's side

69
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,080
Lord

70
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,600
Only this wedding dress was salvaged

71
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:49,881
Where are people

72
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:52,520
Where are people

73
00:07:53,321 --> 00:07:54,121
River turbulence

74
00:07:54,321 --> 00:07:55,681
I'm afraid I have to go downstream to salvage the body

75
00:07:57,481 --> 00:07:58,400
What do you mean

76
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,681
She's dead

77
00:08:01,761 --> 00:08:02,561
Lord, spare your life

78
00:08:06,001 --> 00:08:06,921
Want to die

79
00:08:07,681 --> 00:08:08,681
It's not that easy

80
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,400
There is a letter in the wedding dress

81
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,600
Cui You'an personally opened up

82
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,361
I've been forced to marry

83
00:08:21,881 --> 00:08:23,200
Captive and married in a ghost

84
00:08:24,121 --> 00:08:27,160
Do you know where you are better than them

85
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,400
You're more hypocritical

86
00:08:30,561 --> 00:08:32,921
You dropped an invitation to the high door

87
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:35,160
I should give it up as a lifesaver

88
00:08:35,441 --> 00:08:37,640
Honored to have been chosen by you, huh

89
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,800
Even if you are like a dark cloud

90
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,761
Everyone becomes an accomplice

91
00:08:43,121 --> 00:08:43,881
But you see

92
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:46,001
There's always something you can't win

93
00:08:46,481 --> 00:08:49,201
The barrier of death is something you can't cross

94
00:08:50,841 --> 00:08:52,361
I die today

95
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,001
And reborn today

96
00:08:54,961 --> 00:08:56,320
If you read this letter

97
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,121
The outcome of this hunt has been decided

98
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,081
You didn't control me

99
00:09:03,121 --> 00:09:04,481
But I control you

100
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,320
Choi You-an

101
00:09:07,761 --> 00:09:08,721
You lost

102
00:09:13,001 --> 00:09:16,961
I don't even want my life to win

103
00:09:20,440 --> 00:09:21,361
Did I lose

104
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,040
ridiculous

105
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,520
Lord, don't worry

106
00:09:29,601 --> 00:09:30,640
We will try our best to salvage

107
00:09:31,481 --> 00:09:31,961
That's all

108
00:09:36,841 --> 00:09:38,121
I'm out of proportion

109
00:09:40,241 --> 00:09:41,640
Just a corpse

110
00:09:58,481 --> 00:10:00,081
The groom has not arrived

111
00:10:00,881 --> 00:10:02,241
Can it still be done

112
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,640
Yeah

113
00:10:03,841 --> 00:10:05,400
The guests are half gone

114
00:10:05,961 --> 00:10:07,481
The bride stood there for so long

115
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,160
What's going on

116
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,640
What's wrong

117
00:12:29,761 --> 00:12:30,400
Help away quickly

118
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:31,601
Lang Jun

119
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:33,881
Lang Jun

120
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:34,881
What's this call

121
00:12:34,881 --> 00:12:35,560
Lang Jun, you

122
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,121
The big day turned out like this

123
00:12:38,201 --> 00:12:39,081
rubbish

124
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:40,761
He's a piece of crap

125
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:42,761
rubbish

126
00:12:43,160 --> 00:12:43,920
Absurd

127
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:45,241
ridiculous

128
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,800
rubbish

129
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,160
A little butterfly

130
00:13:03,081 --> 00:13:05,761
Fly over Guanyin Bridge

131
00:13:07,201 --> 00:13:08,400
Cross again

132
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,920
Samsara Gate

133
00:13:13,721 --> 00:13:14,680
Run

134
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,520
Run

135
00:13:21,761 --> 00:13:22,881
But grandmother

136
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:25,761
I'm different from you

137
00:13:26,400 --> 00:13:29,601
I will run away

138
00:14:04,241 --> 00:14:04,800
Adie

139
00:14:06,121 --> 00:14:06,920
Is that you

140
00:14:09,800 --> 00:14:10,841
I'll take you with me

141
00:14:12,841 --> 00:14:14,160
Get out of this cage

142
00:14:48,841 --> 00:14:50,800
What is this

143
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,520
Adie

144
00:15:05,601 --> 00:15:06,241
Adie

145
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:18,121
What the hell is this
