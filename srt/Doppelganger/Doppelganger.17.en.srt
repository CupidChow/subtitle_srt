1
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:57,199
What's going on

2
00:00:58,159 --> 00:00:58,920
Father

3
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,159
Do you know how the cicada mother died

4
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:07,839
Isn't it the thief in the house who hurt her

5
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:10,040
Old things

6
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:11,159
Why bring her up again

7
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:12,760
NO

8
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:14,200
Not

9
00:01:17,319 --> 00:01:18,599
I say yes

10
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:22,480
She deserves to die if she doesn't die

11
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:26,679
The world will know that you are a pariah

12
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:34,319
roll

13
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,319
She deserves to die if she doesn't die

14
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,480
The world will know that you are a pariah

15
00:02:06,519 --> 00:02:07,519
I am sorry

16
00:02:07,519 --> 00:02:08,560
Give me a break

17
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:09,640
What to do with my money

18
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,879
Sorry, sorry

19
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:13,840
I'm sorry, is it useful

20
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,479
I don't dare again

21
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:17,720
I am sorry

22
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:18,840
A bitch of a bitch

23
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:19,560
Beat you to death

24
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:22,680
What to do

25
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:26,479
Do you deserve to die from a low birth?

26
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,439
Of course damn it

27
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:32,400
Why don't you accept it

28
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,280
Dare to hit me dare to hit me you

29
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,680
stop

30
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,240
go

31
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:01,359
Zhen Ren

32
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,439
You have a heart to die

33
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,319
Almost died just now

34
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:12,199
You are the protagonist of the world

35
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:14,159
How can you give up on yourself

36
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:17,000
The favored son of heaven

37
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,240
of course

38
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:22,280
The Third Prince is just a stepping stone on your path to emperor

39
00:03:24,039 --> 00:03:25,439
This is your prophecy again

40
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,560
It's your destiny

41
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,560
Why bother to be slumped

42
00:03:30,479 --> 00:03:31,560
The secret has been dug up

43
00:03:32,359 --> 00:03:33,680
Just hide it deeper

44
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:36,120
Ascend to the throne

45
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,879
What is your background

46
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:39,479
You have the final say

47
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
You're nothing

48
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,400
You're nothing

49
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:51,000
I have the final say

50
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:55,919
Hurry up

51
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:01,919
This is the yamen

52
00:04:02,359 --> 00:04:03,560
Let me see where you go

53
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,840
Who says we're running away

54
00:04:11,359 --> 00:04:14,520
Yao Qianqian, a civilian daughter, sued the present Holy Majesty

55
00:04:15,159 --> 00:04:18,599
Yao Qianqian, a civilian daughter, sued the present Holy Majesty

56
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:20,840
Folk daughter Yao Qianqian Ruixue Dongmei Xiuxiu

57
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:22,479
Sue the present Holy Majesty

58
00:04:22,599 --> 00:04:23,960
Folk daughter Yao Qianqian Ruixue Dongmei Xiuxiu

59
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,559
Sue the present Holy Majesty

60
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:27,400
Folk daughter Yao Qianqian Ruixue Dongmei Xiuxiu

61
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,960
Sue the present Holy Majesty

62
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,679
Folk daughter Yao Qianqian Ruixue Dongmei Xiuxiu

63
00:04:30,679 --> 00:04:32,359
Sue the present Holy Majesty

64
00:04:43,239 --> 00:04:44,559
Bold and tricky woman

65
00:04:44,999 --> 00:04:47,559
Beating the hearing drum is a complaint to the saint

66
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:50,760
How dare you use it to slander the son of heaven

67
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:52,799
Just because of a prophecy of a surging cloud

68
00:04:53,119 --> 00:04:54,520
Your Majesty will put us to death

69
00:04:55,159 --> 00:04:55,840
right

70
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:58,760
We are going to beat the drum of the emperor today

71
00:04:59,039 --> 00:05:00,159
Sue the son of heaven

72
00:05:00,679 --> 00:05:02,999
The son of heaven breaks the law and commits the common people

73
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,440
If right and white are turned upside down under Qingtian Yamen

74
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:08,119
What justice is there in this world

75
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:08,880
right

76
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:11,080
Death without repentance

77
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,999
Where is the punishment?

78
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:14,039
It's not necessary

79
00:05:22,119 --> 00:05:22,960
No need to be punished

80
00:05:24,239 --> 00:05:25,320
His Highness the Third Prince

81
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,799
Immediate execution

82
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,599
Qianqian

83
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:41,599
Qianqian Qianqian

84
00:05:42,679 --> 00:05:49,559
Qianqian Qianqian

85
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,359
Close the door quickly Close

86
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,720
I'll see who dares

87
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,119
Qianqian

88
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:00,599
Shen Que, what do you want

89
00:06:01,119 --> 00:06:01,840
Third Prince

90
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:03,039
Your Majesty specifically told me

91
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,799
To bring the sinners back alive

92
00:06:06,559 --> 00:06:07,400
When was the imperial edict

93
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,679
My order was to shoot and kill

94
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:15,960
You

95
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,559
Your Majesty has passed away

96
00:06:30,799 --> 00:06:32,919
The imperial edict arrives

97
00:06:36,119 --> 00:06:38,119
Zhao Yong received the edict

98
00:06:42,679 --> 00:06:44,440
Fengtian Carrier

99
00:06:44,440 --> 00:06:45,960
The emperor's edict said

100
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:48,359
Third Prince Zhao Yong

101
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:49,799
Establish as an heir

102
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Succeeding Datong to the throne

103
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,119
Tell the world

104
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,280
Salty envoy smells it

105
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,320
I admire this

106
00:06:58,799 --> 00:07:01,119
My son received the decree

107
00:07:26,119 --> 00:07:27,239
poisonous

108
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:51,720
Sorry

109
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:54,599
Let you live in such a bad world

110
00:08:05,999 --> 00:08:06,999
Choi You-an

111
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,039
No more Zhao Yong

112
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:12,400
Let me see how you get to that position

113
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,520
Hurry up, hurry up, arrest her

114
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:35,520
Thank you

115
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,720
Trusted me again

116
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,239
You want me to give you up

117
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,119
Right

118
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:52,320
Only then will His Majesty spare you

119
00:08:52,639 --> 00:08:53,320
But

120
00:08:54,479 --> 00:08:55,239
Shen Que

121
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:59,320
Being alive is the most important thing

122
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:16,119
Give you a hidden weapon that suits you

123
00:09:19,999 --> 00:09:20,759
hidden weapon

124
00:09:22,119 --> 00:09:22,840
Click here

125
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:23,999
The hidden weapon will explode

126
00:09:24,479 --> 00:09:26,479
But it needs to be used when people are caught off guard

127
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:31,639
I have something for you too

128
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:33,320
what

129
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,680
Next time

130
00:09:39,359 --> 00:09:39,960
Good

131
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:50,239
The moon is so beautiful tonight

132
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,160
Yeah

133
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:03,999
What are you thinking

134
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:07,720
Once upon a time sitting on a pile of corpses

135
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:09,720
The moon hangs high

136
00:10:10,519 --> 00:10:11,599
Like a copper mirror

137
00:10:13,560 --> 00:10:16,200
I suddenly thought I was a ghost of the underworld

138
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:19,879
Looking hopelessly at the moon on earth

139
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,200
Hazy and unreal

140
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:25,320
Thousands of miles away

141
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:31,080
Shen Que

142
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:35,879
I'll watch the moon with you from now on

143
00:10:54,519 --> 00:10:56,399
Tomorrow at noon, I will ask you to eat and start on the road

144
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:26,119
You're here

145
00:11:27,999 --> 00:11:29,239
You killed the third prince

146
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,639
Only the imperial grandson can inherit the throne

147
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,560
He pardoned the sinful girl

148
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,800
Caught the magistrate again

149
00:11:35,239 --> 00:11:36,479
You should be satisfied

150
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:40,239
Come with me

151
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:41,359
go

152
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:43,560
I killed someone

153
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:45,999
You are the heroine of this world

154
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,800
What is it to kill a prince

155
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,080
It doesn't hurt to kill all the people in the world

156
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:57,119
But I just can't kill Choi You-an

157
00:12:07,599 --> 00:12:08,279
a form of address for one's wife

158
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:09,759
What are you embroidering

159
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,160
That must be for General Shen

160
00:12:16,519 --> 00:12:18,800
I remember he seems to have a similar bell

161
00:12:19,599 --> 00:12:20,720
Yes Yes Yes

162
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,320
I can't hide anything from you

163
00:12:27,239 --> 00:12:27,920
done

164
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:30,160
You can give it to him tonight

165
00:12:34,519 --> 00:12:35,239
Does it look good

166
00:12:46,759 --> 00:12:48,759
I want to send Qianqian's ashes back to her house

167
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,320
Can teach a good child like Qianqian

168
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:55,920
Her parents must be very good

169
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:57,399
Yeah

170
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
Her father is the censor

171
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:03,639
Her family is a well-known house of righteousness

172
00:13:06,359 --> 00:13:07,080
pity

173
00:13:19,399 --> 00:13:20,960
I didn't think you actually got away

174
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,359
I told you I had my way

175
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:25,960
Jiang Jiaojiao

176
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:27,840
Thank you

177
00:13:28,999 --> 00:13:30,759
I created such a bad world

178
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,440
You have to clean up this mess yourself

179
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,879
You really have changed a lot

180
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:42,999
Near death

181
00:13:44,999 --> 00:13:46,080
I saw a man

182
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:02,119
You are

183
00:14:02,239 --> 00:14:03,200
It's me

184
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:05,999
Jiang Jiaojiao, I am ten years old you

185
00:14:06,999 --> 00:14:08,399
Why is it you

186
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:10,680
Sorry

187
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:13,759
See yourself when you grow up

188
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:16,639
Very disappointed

189
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,519
I think you're cool

190
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:20,479
How dare you fight against a bad guy

191
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,399
I wouldn't even dare to go out of the school wall

192
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,720
But no one cares about me

193
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:33,440
No one loves me

194
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:35,080
I like you

195
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,080
You like me

196
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:42,479
I always like you 100% forever

197
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,879
I like you the most in the universe

198
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,320
More than Doraemon

199
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,720
More than Doraemon

200
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,239
I suddenly remembered

201
00:14:56,920 --> 00:14:58,200
Ten years old me

202
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:01,080
What was the biggest dream at that time

203
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,200
Is it to be a princess waiting for the prince to kiss up

204
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,160
It doesn't seem

205
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,160
What is that

206
00:15:09,279 --> 00:15:11,440
Become a biologist

207
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:12,800
Right

208
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,119
I remember

209
00:15:16,479 --> 00:15:18,720
Live, get up from here

210
00:15:19,279 --> 00:15:21,720
Go to the Himalayas to see antelope rock climbing

211
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,999
Go to the rainforest to find tree-eyed beasts

212
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,920
Go to the Arctic Ocean to capture the whale splash

213
00:15:28,599 --> 00:15:30,759
Go wherever you want

214
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,999
Don't be afraid to have no companion

215
00:15:33,160 --> 00:15:34,279
I've always been there

216
00:15:34,599 --> 00:15:35,879
I've always been there

217
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,440
We are the best in the world

218
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,440
I'm going back to my world

219
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:53,359
Will you join me

220
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:56,759
No way

221
00:15:57,680 --> 00:16:00,119
I promised Shen to stay

222
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:04,599
What's wrong

223
00:16:06,200 --> 00:16:06,960
Nothing

224
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:10,320
I rely on my memory

225
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,359
Probably finished writing the plot behind the novel

226
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,879
Incomplete

227
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:15,759
But it might work for you

228
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:19,080
Don't look now

229
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:20,359
Why

230
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,680
Knowing the future is not necessarily a blessing

231
00:16:23,239 --> 00:16:26,040
This is a book that predicts the future with half truths

232
00:16:26,759 --> 00:16:28,519
You must not believe what is written in the book

233
00:16:28,999 --> 00:16:30,040
You can't blindly believe it

234
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,119
It's actually a good thing not to be sure how things end

235
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:33,999
Confirmed

236
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:35,720
My heart is dead

237
00:16:36,879 --> 00:16:38,639
If you have hope for that future

238
00:16:39,479 --> 00:16:41,040
You will be even more unwilling to see it

239
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:42,680
More desperate

240
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,639
After so many things

241
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,759
What else can make me despair

242
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:52,920
Please put the book away

243
00:16:54,999 --> 00:16:56,800
If nothing happens in the future

244
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:57,759
You just forget it

245
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,920
But if one day you can't go on

246
00:17:00,479 --> 00:17:01,599
You open it again

247
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,840
It's good to know what you know

248
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:06,200
thanks a lot

249
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,119
I'm gone

250
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:12,720
treasure

251
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,079
Let's go

252
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,519
I know you're staying for Shen Che

253
00:17:23,079 --> 00:17:24,319
But I want to remind you

254
00:17:24,999 --> 00:17:27,559
Human nature is the most elusive

255
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:29,960
I don't mean to shake you

256
00:17:30,479 --> 00:17:31,559
But I'll wait for you

257
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,160
I am at the reincarnation door

258
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:35,360
Two hours after you arrive
