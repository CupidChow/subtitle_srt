1
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:50,439
Run

2
00:00:53,519 --> 00:00:54,519
Why did Lady Jiang run away

3
00:00:55,879 --> 00:00:56,519
I

4
00:00:59,119 --> 00:00:59,760
It's okay

5
00:01:00,479 --> 00:01:01,479
Just come back with me

6
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:08,119
She's coming with me

7
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,519
You're seeking death

8
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,400
I am indeed not afraid of death

9
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:14,079
Let go

10
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:15,279
Let go

11
00:01:20,359 --> 00:01:21,079
Let go

12
00:01:21,999 --> 00:01:23,279
Let go

13
00:01:30,639 --> 00:01:31,600
I lost my mind

14
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:33,960
I'm sorry, Miss Jiang

15
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:47,119
Cui Yongzi

16
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:49,800
I want to talk to you first

17
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:54,760
Good

18
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,359
Has Young Master Cui ever seen a bird called Wugui

19
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,359
Every family keeps ghosts

20
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,000
Eat yellow croaker every meal

21
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:20,959
When I was a child, my father pointed to a black ghost and told me

22
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:22,639
It fishes every day

23
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:24,239
But never have enough to eat

24
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:27,040
Because the fisherman always takes the fish he catches

25
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,479
In that fire

26
00:02:28,479 --> 00:02:29,440
When I was dying

27
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,479
I understood

28
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,000
I'm the black ghost

29
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,880
I know your past suffering

30
00:02:35,359 --> 00:02:37,519
I won't let your mother and brother bully you again

31
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,679
NO

32
00:02:39,199 --> 00:02:39,959
You don't understand

33
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:42,160
I'm a ghost

34
00:02:42,199 --> 00:02:43,959
But don't feel sorry for yourself

35
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,160
If you let it go

36
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:47,760
It can also soar in the world

37
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,079
Wugui is right

38
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:50,840
What's so sorry about

39
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:53,600
The young master read all the sages' books

40
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,760
You tell me

41
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:56,560
It is the noble fisherman who grabs the fish

42
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,959
Or is the fishing ghost more valuable

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,079
Naturally, it's a black ghost

44
00:03:01,679 --> 00:03:02,519
Be so

45
00:03:03,399 --> 00:03:05,079
I managed to break free of the rope

46
00:03:05,079 --> 00:03:06,000
Get back your wings

47
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,639
Young master, why bother to lure me into the cage again

48
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,399
I'm different from them

49
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,160
I will protect you

50
00:03:13,399 --> 00:03:17,280
Your protection is the most terrible rope

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:20,280
I'm afraid Lady Jiang has misunderstood

52
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,479
I'm the only two here

53
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:25,600
Why not be honest

54
00:03:26,639 --> 00:03:27,919
What does Lady Jiang mean?

55
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,359
That Day Restaurant

56
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:32,799
I didn't drug Young Master Cui

57
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:34,880
Aphrodisiac

58
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:36,560
It's your work

59
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,519
But he's innocent

60
00:03:53,919 --> 00:03:55,079
Shouldn't be involved

61
00:04:35,599 --> 00:04:36,760
You found out

62
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:39,959
As a plaything

63
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,000
You're funny

64
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,360
But a little too smart

65
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:45,159
You have already discovered

66
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:46,599
Why do you say it

67
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:49,480
I didn't remember it very well at first

68
00:04:49,839 --> 00:04:51,440
I thought I was really drugged

69
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,159
Until later

70
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,639
The memory gradually becomes clear

71
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,599
But you are so scheming

72
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,399
Also high weight

73
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:01,480
I can only pretend I don't remember

74
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,000
Deal with you

75
00:05:05,519 --> 00:05:06,839
Waiting for an opportunity to

76
00:05:09,920 --> 00:05:10,719
escape

77
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,360
Escape to Shen Que's place

78
00:05:14,199 --> 00:05:16,079
I'm afraid he hates you by now

79
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:18,560
Thought you betrayed him to cling to me

80
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,599
Failed to help your fiance get rid of me

81
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,760
Very disappointed

82
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:25,279
You did it

83
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:27,719
I wanted to catch him and Zhao Chengze all at once

84
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,199
And underestimated him

85
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,959
But I advise you to stop thinking about him

86
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:34,599
Nothing to do with him

87
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,599
I warned you in front of the temple

88
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,719
Buddha, you can't lie

89
00:05:38,719 --> 00:05:40,839
On the eve of the wedding, I'll let you make another choice

90
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,760
Why are you stubborn

91
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,880
I can only stop this game

92
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,399
What are your qualifications

93
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:50,320
But why did you choose me

94
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,839
You really don't remember

95
00:05:55,159 --> 00:05:57,320
Lady, it's so cold

96
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,519
Yeah, hurry home

97
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,560
Help me

98
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,560
Lady, he

99
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,039
He seems pretty badly injured

100
00:06:13,159 --> 00:06:13,959
Did you find

101
00:06:14,279 --> 00:06:15,079
no

102
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,519
Help me lure them away and this is yours

103
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,320
Go look for another walk

104
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,079
a form of address for one's wife

105
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:24,440
Help

106
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,719
Forget about kittens and puppies

107
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:29,920
Can unknown people help casually

108
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:32,440
Be careful to get angry and walk

109
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,039
Kittens and puppies

110
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,480
Do you know who I am

111
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,440
This is enough to buy a lot of you

112
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,440
I don't know who you are

113
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:42,120
I don't want to know who you are

114
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:45,279
I don't think your life is worth more than mine

115
00:06:46,079 --> 00:06:47,399
My life is priceless

116
00:06:54,079 --> 00:06:54,800
Hello

117
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,880
Madam, that golden sore medicine is not cheap

118
00:07:09,719 --> 00:07:13,199
So you married me to get back at me

119
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:14,839
Revenge

120
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,199
You think too highly of yourself

121
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,560
I was just taming one

122
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,959
Just a disobedient pet

123
00:07:20,279 --> 00:07:21,760
See how much money you're gonna pay for

124
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:22,639
Sell yourself

125
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,360
You surprised me

126
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:28,680
I can't even buy you as the young lady of the Prime Minister's Mansion

127
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,039
I can give you whatever you want

128
00:07:33,519 --> 00:07:35,519
Are you not satisfied with Jiang Yaozu's fate

129
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,920
Jiang Yaozu, you too

130
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,039
Cui Yongzi

131
00:07:43,079 --> 00:07:44,519
Who allowed you to touch her

132
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:46,839
I didn't let me go, okay

133
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:54,120
It was this hand that signed the deed of sale

134
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,839
No I don't have

135
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:15,599
Lang Jun

136
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,039
Lang Jun

137
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:21,760
Bride's Arrangement

138
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:23,120
The prime minister has made up his mind

139
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,159
No room for manoeuvre

140
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:29,039
You know the temper of the Prime Minister

141
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:30,599
If you continue to be so stubborn

142
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:31,760
Afraid

143
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:50,720
Good

144
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:52,559
Auspicious times are approaching

145
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:53,760
Lang Jun, please go home

146
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,319
The prime minister is still waiting

147
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,039
Look, I won

148
00:09:07,840 --> 00:09:09,080
What are you laughing about

149
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:11,519
Yeah, you won

150
00:09:12,319 --> 00:09:13,399
Good thing you came

151
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,799
I was afraid you wouldn't come

152
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:16,000
Thank you

153
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
Thank me

154
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,760
I took everything away from you

155
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:23,360
You thank me

156
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:24,960
Is it

157
00:09:25,480 --> 00:09:26,399
Jiaojiao

158
00:09:27,319 --> 00:09:29,039
Did you really take it

159
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:30,799
What do you mean

160
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:35,840
Have you ever thought that your brother's widowed mother is partial

161
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,720
Fiance with a human face and an animal heart

162
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,120
Why should I rob with you

163
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,880
I just want you to feel

164
00:09:46,639 --> 00:09:48,480
They just deserve to be robbed

165
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:52,279
The Jiang family is my first cage

166
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:55,559
Choi You'an is the second level

167
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,760
You don't know how many times I prayed

168
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:01,639
Can someone replace me

169
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:06,679
So the moment you emerge from the fire

170
00:10:06,679 --> 00:10:08,559
What I feel is not panic

171
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,639
Instead

172
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,200
wild with joy

173
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:23,919
Later I was in front of the Buddha

174
00:10:23,919 --> 00:10:25,000
I beg you to disappear

175
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:26,799
Second, ask me to marry me

176
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:29,080
I got the next draw

177
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:33,000
Which means you won't disappear

178
00:10:33,639 --> 00:10:34,439
And I

179
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:37,840
Won't marry Choi You-an either

180
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:44,319
What to sign

181
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,519
You are clearly in my life

182
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:50,480
The first to sign

183
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:55,200
You didn't let me down

184
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,480
You shine at the banquet

185
00:10:58,799 --> 00:11:00,200
Favored by the queen

186
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,559
Now the Prime Minister has chosen you

187
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,039
Then Choi Woo-an has to choose you

188
00:11:07,439 --> 00:11:08,200
It's impossible

189
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,000
Impossible

190
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:12,240
Choi You-an's character is kind and upright

191
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:13,840
But you say he's a human face and an animal heart

192
00:11:14,559 --> 00:11:16,840
You're definitely jealous of me. You're lying

193
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:24,919
You're jealous of me

194
00:11:31,559 --> 00:11:33,159
Langjun, you, you, what

195
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,240
Her father valued her so much

196
00:11:35,960 --> 00:11:37,639
You can actually change your face overnight

197
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,480
I want to see

198
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,880
Is she really powerful

199
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:43,760
It seems that unless I die

200
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:45,559
He won't let me go

201
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:48,679
What are you gonna do

202
00:11:49,039 --> 00:11:51,760
Now I have only one last way to go

203
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,919
Jiaojiao

204
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,120
Let me give you another hand

205
00:11:58,360 --> 00:12:01,760
You will be me after today

206
00:12:07,799 --> 00:12:08,600
Thank you

207
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,200
Become me

208
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:12,960
Jiang Song

209
00:12:16,159 --> 00:12:17,120
Jiang Niangzi

210
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:28,480
Jiang Niangzi

211
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,159
Jiang Song

212
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:35,960
Jiang Song

213
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:39,639
Go down and look

214
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:40,519
Yes

215
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:45,399
Lord

216
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:47,679
Do you need subordinates to go down to the bottom of the cliff to look for Lady Jiang

217
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,039
Lord

218
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,840
Fall down

219
00:12:56,279 --> 00:12:57,480
Can you still survive

220
00:12:59,439 --> 00:13:00,360
I'm afraid

221
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:02,799
There is more luck than luck

222
00:13:03,799 --> 00:13:04,799
What are you looking for

223
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:23,159
Jiang Song

224
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,000
Jiang Song

225
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,200
Jiang Song

226
00:13:29,240 --> 00:13:30,319
Jiang Song

227
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:32,319
Jiang Song

228
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:33,639
Jiang Song

229
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:35,080
General, I'll go over there

230
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:25,399
Birds chirp cicadas chirp wind and moon

231
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:32,000
You're free Jiang Song

232
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:01,480
OK

233
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:03,200
It's just skin trauma

234
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,480
Lord

235
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,039
The housekeeper took Lady Jiang with him

236
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,279
Go back and prepare for the wedding first

237
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,439
I only got one steamed bun today

238
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:50,880
I'm so hungry

239
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,000
Half eaten

240
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,399
I'm sorry, Ama

241
00:15:56,399 --> 00:15:57,319
What are you crying about

242
00:15:59,439 --> 00:16:00,960
Officials and people spare their lives

243
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:03,720
The villain didn't mean to disturb the officials

244
00:16:04,679 --> 00:16:05,559
I ask you

245
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:07,279
What are you crying about

246
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:11,399
My grandmother is dead

247
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,360
I'll never see her again

248
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,120
Dead is dead

249
00:16:17,679 --> 00:16:18,600
So what

250
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:24,720
say

251
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:27,319
Dead

252
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:30,720
I couldn't see her smiling at me

253
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,559
Jiang Niangzi

254
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,080
Cui Yongzi

255
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,840
Can't hear her call my name

256
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,159
I can't see her every day

257
00:16:57,159 --> 00:16:58,799
Be good to her

258
00:17:08,080 --> 00:17:09,159
Cui Yongzi

259
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:15,319
Cui Yongzi

260
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:21,319
Lord

261
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:41,160
Jiang Song

262
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,240
Jiang Song

263
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:48,000
Jiang Song

264
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:51,640
Jiang Song

265
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:55,839
Jiang Song

266
00:18:05,119 --> 00:18:05,920
Jiang Song

267
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:07,920
I found you

268
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,319
Jiang Song

269
00:18:10,319 --> 00:18:11,000
Let go

270
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:11,640
I don't

271
00:18:11,640 --> 00:18:12,839
I let you let go

272
00:18:12,839 --> 00:18:13,359
I don't

273
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:17,760
Jiang Song

274
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,200
General Shen

275
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:24,039
The ginger song you're looking for

276
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,079
He died just now

277
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,559
I'm wrong about you

278
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:36,039
I thought you were going to marry Choi Woo-an

279
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:37,839
I'm so angry

280
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,680
Will you come home with me

281
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:41,599
I have no home anymore

282
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:44,319
If you want to

283
00:18:44,319 --> 00:18:45,359
I don't want to

284
00:18:47,119 --> 00:18:47,839
What about me

285
00:18:49,879 --> 00:18:51,480
Your future is unlimited

286
00:18:52,079 --> 00:18:53,480
Why cling to me

287
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,039
Jiang Song

288
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,119
I won't look back

289
00:18:56,319 --> 00:18:57,400
It won't stop

290
00:18:58,079 --> 00:18:59,680
You don't know how long I've been waiting for it

291
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:02,240
My escape

292
00:19:03,920 --> 00:19:07,000
It started a long time ago
