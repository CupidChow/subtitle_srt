1
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:54,961
You're here

2
00:00:56,721 --> 00:00:58,840
I've become more and more like Jiang Jiaojiao recently

3
00:00:59,961 --> 00:01:01,840
It's you, isn't it

4
00:01:02,361 --> 00:01:03,200
Yes

5
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,401
Your preferences, emotions, thoughts

6
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,120
Will be infinitely close to her

7
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:11,241
And finally become her

8
00:01:14,601 --> 00:01:16,041
I refuse to be Jiang Jiaojiao

9
00:01:16,041 --> 00:01:17,241
You arrogantly put her

10
00:01:17,241 --> 00:01:18,801
Inside my body

11
00:01:20,401 --> 00:01:21,161
Six days

12
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,241
There are six days left to end this story

13
00:01:25,241 --> 00:01:26,401
Everyone disappears

14
00:01:27,401 --> 00:01:29,200
Only you can be Jiang Jiaojiao

15
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:30,640
Go to another world

16
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,681
Keep on living

17
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,000
Is it bad

18
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,161
Even if only for six days

19
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,801
I also want to be my Jiang Song alive

20
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,801
Jiang Song is just a fictional character

21
00:01:43,161 --> 00:01:45,041
Never lived at all

22
00:01:45,321 --> 00:01:46,920
Knowing that everything is false

23
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,521
Knowing there is no road ahead

24
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,080
What are you holding on to

25
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:52,041
Or say

26
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:54,881
You want to do it by yourself

27
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:56,401
Change the ending

28
00:01:56,401 --> 00:01:57,601
Living for this world

29
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:00,360
Jiang Jiaojiao said

30
00:02:01,161 --> 00:02:02,200
I'm a paper man

31
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:03,881
My ending

32
00:02:04,241 --> 00:02:05,521
It's a burial fire

33
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,441
You said the world was about to collapse

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,840
Everything will be empty

35
00:02:09,241 --> 00:02:09,840
But

36
00:02:11,161 --> 00:02:12,480
Is the end everything

37
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,961
Paper man

38
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,121
Do you want to live with the end as the guide

39
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,881
I don't

40
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,240
This moment is what I exist for

41
00:02:24,841 --> 00:02:26,080
Here here

42
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,920
Is my destination

43
00:02:32,601 --> 00:02:34,001
Something's wrong with me lately

44
00:02:35,161 --> 00:02:36,281
But I'm sure

45
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,920
It's not you who I have a date with

46
00:02:40,561 --> 00:02:41,761
Do you know what love is

47
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,920
You're just a heartless monster

48
00:02:46,561 --> 00:02:47,360
Aunt Qiu

49
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:49,080
What happened to Lang Jun

50
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:50,561
I hurt you

51
00:02:52,121 --> 00:02:53,281
How to love someone

52
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,680
Love someone is actually very simple

53
00:02:56,561 --> 00:02:58,281
You just have to make her happy

54
00:02:59,881 --> 00:03:00,640
Happy

55
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,680
Why is it so simple

56
00:03:06,841 --> 00:03:08,001
I just can't learn

57
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,920
Why am I different from others

58
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:16,161
Why am I a heartless monster

59
00:03:17,281 --> 00:03:18,080
Lang Jun

60
00:03:21,601 --> 00:03:23,001
I'm empty here

61
00:03:24,761 --> 00:03:25,920
Getting empty

62
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:28,920
No matter what, it can't be filled

63
00:03:29,721 --> 00:03:30,800
What am I doing wrong

64
00:03:32,441 --> 00:03:34,161
Heaven wants to treat me like this

65
00:03:34,321 --> 00:03:35,800
Lang Jun did nothing wrong

66
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:37,920
Everything is a trick of nature

67
00:03:39,001 --> 00:03:39,920
NO

68
00:03:41,161 --> 00:03:42,360
There must be a reason

69
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,480
There must be a reason

70
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Lang Jun

71
00:03:58,360 --> 00:03:59,520
Lady, you

72
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,601
What are you doing

73
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,281
I'm remembering my own name

74
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,640
Seven seven

75
00:04:11,841 --> 00:04:14,041
If one day I forget my name

76
00:04:15,121 --> 00:04:17,240
Do you have to remind me

77
00:04:21,761 --> 00:04:23,160
You're gonna remind me

78
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:27,001
I will

79
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:22,640
This general is dead here

80
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:23,921
General, look, look, look

81
00:05:23,921 --> 00:05:24,241
not good

82
00:05:24,241 --> 00:05:25,280
The dead man, the general

83
00:05:26,241 --> 00:05:27,321
What's going on

84
00:05:36,801 --> 00:05:37,520
Smoke again

85
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,600
Chase

86
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:47,241
Flowered cloth

87
00:05:55,241 --> 00:05:55,840
Over there

88
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,080
Amo

89
00:05:59,080 --> 00:05:59,681
Seven seven

90
00:06:00,481 --> 00:06:01,441
General Shen

91
00:06:06,361 --> 00:06:07,640
This sachet is yours

92
00:06:08,321 --> 00:06:09,640
No, no, not mine

93
00:06:09,881 --> 00:06:11,520
I just picked it up at my feet

94
00:06:11,761 --> 00:06:13,121
I thought no one wanted it

95
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:14,080
I put it on

96
00:06:14,481 --> 00:06:15,280
Take away

97
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:20,200
Not

98
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,001
General Jiang Lady is here

99
00:06:34,361 --> 00:06:35,040
Disappear

100
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:36,881
I've let her in

101
00:06:45,080 --> 00:06:46,160
There is no need to plead

102
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,040
I didn't have to plead for her

103
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:52,960
I just wanted to take a look at her

104
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:55,720
You believe her

105
00:06:57,001 --> 00:06:58,640
Qiqi and I are like sisters

106
00:06:58,640 --> 00:06:59,561
Deep love and heavy righteousness

107
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:00,960
I believe her

108
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,921
You really have a deep affection for everyone

109
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:07,960
What is that

110
00:07:18,001 --> 00:07:19,681
I made your favorite fish cakes

111
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,001
The one who likes this is Choi Woo-an

112
00:07:30,361 --> 00:07:31,361
Damn Chasta

113
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:32,761
Tampered with my memory

114
00:07:37,361 --> 00:07:38,040
Jiang Song

115
00:07:38,241 --> 00:07:39,441
Why do you play with me like this

116
00:07:39,640 --> 00:07:39,960
I am sorry

117
00:07:39,960 --> 00:07:41,160
Do you think a murderer like me

118
00:07:41,361 --> 00:07:42,121
Is there no heart

119
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,921
It's not you, listen to me, it's Jung

120
00:07:43,921 --> 00:07:44,960
If you want to save someone

121
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:46,640
Just show some sincerity

122
00:07:47,441 --> 00:07:48,600
Shen Que Shen Que

123
00:07:49,361 --> 00:07:50,121
What are you doing

124
00:07:50,481 --> 00:07:51,720
Shen Que, calm down

125
00:07:52,321 --> 00:07:53,160
Shen Que

126
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,121
Shen Que, calm down Shen Que

127
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,481
If it makes you feel better

128
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,280
Shen Que

129
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:29,520
Jiang Song

130
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:32,321
Do you know that

131
00:08:34,121 --> 00:08:35,840
The only thing in the world that scares me

132
00:08:37,001 --> 00:08:37,840
Only you

133
00:08:39,881 --> 00:08:42,160
I'm afraid to see me so despicable in your eyes

134
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,841
But now I'm not afraid

135
00:08:53,001 --> 00:08:54,121
Blame me for being greedy

136
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,721
Stolen the moonlight

137
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:04,961
I still want to pick the moon

138
00:09:07,400 --> 00:09:08,201
Shen Que

139
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,160
Shen Shen Que

140
00:09:20,601 --> 00:09:21,320
Not

141
00:09:47,881 --> 00:09:48,440
Eat

142
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:58,761
Thank you

143
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,081
You

144
00:10:02,961 --> 00:10:04,001
Don't be upset

145
00:10:06,721 --> 00:10:07,680
actually

146
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:12,241
Actually, my engagement with Shen Que is fake

147
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,280
I didn't want to tell you

148
00:10:18,520 --> 00:10:20,520
But I hate seeing

149
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,680
A girl crying

150
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,201
I'm not doing this for

151
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:28,640
Then you're trying to

152
00:10:29,601 --> 00:10:30,400
Seven seven

153
00:10:35,481 --> 00:10:36,761
I can let her go home first

154
00:10:37,761 --> 00:10:38,881
But send someone to watch

155
00:10:42,241 --> 00:10:42,841
Thank you

156
00:10:43,481 --> 00:10:45,040
I'm not all trying to help you

157
00:10:46,001 --> 00:10:47,241
I guess she was framed

158
00:10:49,241 --> 00:10:50,560
They're still not human

159
00:10:51,201 --> 00:10:52,560
Why are you so ruthless

160
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,081
I'm fine, Sister Ruixue

161
00:10:56,361 --> 00:10:57,160
Don't cry

162
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:01,361
It's all my fault for being too greedy for petty gain

163
00:11:01,881 --> 00:11:03,481
Will be misunderstood by General Shen

164
00:11:04,520 --> 00:11:06,841
Madam, don't blame General Shen

165
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,361
He's just a routine business

166
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,280
Then you explained it so clearly to them

167
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:13,361
And they beat you

168
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:14,841
It's really good

169
00:11:15,721 --> 00:11:16,481
but

170
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,520
General Shen has become a little scary recently

171
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,001
It doesn't look like the guy I used to know

172
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:27,040
I think he's just like his adoptive father

173
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,081
Cold-blooded and ruthless

174
00:11:28,241 --> 00:11:29,680
Neither light nor heavy

175
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,040
Does it hurt

176
00:11:38,001 --> 00:11:39,160
My lady doesn't cry

177
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,201
Qiqi doesn't hurt

178
00:11:54,121 --> 00:11:56,081
You are the most faithful believer of God

179
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:58,640
Seeing that Cui You'an's great cause will be accomplished

180
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,601
Jiang Song Shen Que centrifuged

181
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,040
How can you easily waver

182
00:12:06,761 --> 00:12:07,881
The believers have not wavered

183
00:12:09,241 --> 00:12:09,800
just

184
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:11,081
Just what

185
00:12:15,121 --> 00:12:16,160
Is the incompetence of the believers

186
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,160
Nothing

187
00:12:19,001 --> 00:12:20,320
Can you do anymore for Bi Shen

188
00:12:25,201 --> 00:12:26,640
You're just too tired

189
00:12:27,361 --> 00:12:28,721
How is your injury

190
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:31,560
It's important to do it myself

191
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,001
Zhen Ren

192
00:12:33,601 --> 00:12:34,320
Don't worry

193
00:12:35,481 --> 00:12:37,680
God blesses you

194
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:44,001
Where have you been

195
00:12:46,361 --> 00:12:47,001
a form of address for one's wife

196
00:12:47,721 --> 00:12:48,601
I can't sleep

197
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:50,081
I went outside for a while

198
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,440
Your injury heals so quickly

199
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,761
Of course

200
00:12:56,721 --> 00:12:58,160
Is there a lady to apply medicine to me

201
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,601
Seven seven

202
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,640
Is there something you're hiding from me

203
00:13:05,721 --> 00:13:06,440
No

204
00:13:07,881 --> 00:13:08,920
Lady, you

205
00:13:10,201 --> 00:13:11,520
Are you suspecting me

206
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,560
I'm Qiqi

207
00:13:16,201 --> 00:13:17,440
Just because you are Qiqi

208
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,241
So I wanted to ask you personally

209
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:22,601
Is this the peony you embroidered

210
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:25,400
The tail thread is tied with two knots

211
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:30,040
The butterfly in Dongmei's hand

212
00:13:31,241 --> 00:13:32,761
It also ends with two knots

213
00:13:35,601 --> 00:13:36,160
of course

214
00:13:37,001 --> 00:13:40,320
There are two people in this world who tie the thread

215
00:13:41,961 --> 00:13:43,040
You won't be alone

216
00:13:43,761 --> 00:13:45,320
So I just followed you

217
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
Can I trust you

218
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:49,640
Of course you can

219
00:13:50,601 --> 00:13:52,680
There's something I want to ask you for

220
00:13:54,081 --> 00:13:55,400
Actually I'm a little skeptical

221
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:57,601
When I see this

222
00:13:57,961 --> 00:13:59,201
I told myself I was overthinking

223
00:13:59,841 --> 00:14:00,961
Dare not think about it

224
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,481
But I smell you

225
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:07,040
It's exactly the same as the one in the Saden House

226
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:09,040
Seven seven

227
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,520
You were forced, right

228
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
Ten years

229
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:21,121
Or did you find out

230
00:14:25,121 --> 00:14:25,680
Why

231
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,040
The day Zhenren sent me into Jiang's house

232
00:14:31,481 --> 00:14:32,601
It was before dawn

233
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:35,201
She pointed to the horizon

234
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:37,640
Tell me

235
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,201
Light will be born on earth

236
00:14:41,241 --> 00:14:42,680
But the darkness needs to be dispelled

237
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:44,920
Wait until the light comes

238
00:14:45,481 --> 00:14:47,001
There is only joy in the world

239
00:14:47,241 --> 00:14:48,121
No mourning

240
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:49,920
Only reunion

241
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,241
There is no separation

242
00:14:51,841 --> 00:14:53,721
Then my father and mother

243
00:14:53,961 --> 00:14:56,560
Will my sister come back

244
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,160
Won't

245
00:14:59,241 --> 00:15:00,121
But by then

246
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,121
There will be no other children

247
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,800
Suffer from the world like you

248
00:15:05,241 --> 00:15:07,920
Well, what should I do

249
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,761
You just need to

250
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,841
Become your maid

251
00:15:15,121 --> 00:15:16,961
Qiqi, watch it here

252
00:15:17,201 --> 00:15:18,361
The carriage will arrive in a moment

253
00:15:18,881 --> 00:15:19,400
Good

254
00:15:26,721 --> 00:15:27,361
A Lang

255
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:29,440
There are crickets there

256
00:15:30,001 --> 00:15:30,520
Is it

257
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:32,081
I'll go see

258
00:15:34,081 --> 00:15:35,961
Jiang Song and Shen must be separated

259
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,680
It is God's will

260
00:15:38,841 --> 00:15:40,481
Wasn't he just here

261
00:15:41,201 --> 00:15:43,280
Qiqi, where did Yaozu go

262
00:15:43,721 --> 00:15:44,841
What do you think

263
00:15:44,841 --> 00:15:45,320
What's wrong

264
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,761
Yaozu

265
00:15:45,761 --> 00:15:47,520
Shen Que, my brother is missing

266
00:15:47,961 --> 00:15:49,001
You guys stay here and I'll go find

267
00:15:49,481 --> 00:15:49,961
Good

268
00:16:00,361 --> 00:16:02,520
Drive out darkness and welcome light

269
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,320
For the happiness of all beings

270
00:16:05,201 --> 00:16:05,920
Seven seven

271
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:08,361
Jiang Song must die

272
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:14,121
Decade

273
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,761
You and I have known each other for ten years

274
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:19,881
Good

275
00:16:20,961 --> 00:16:22,040
Even if you don't care about me

276
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:23,280
What about Dongmei

277
00:16:23,601 --> 00:16:25,160
How can you do it

278
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,721
If you are obedient to Sadato

279
00:16:27,481 --> 00:16:28,440
Be a heroine

280
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,761
She might not have had to die

281
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:33,201
Not only did she not have to die

282
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,001
Wait for this story

283
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:36,640
Happy ending

284
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:38,241
All the people

285
00:16:40,601 --> 00:16:42,280
You can do it without life or death

286
00:16:42,481 --> 00:16:43,761
That's what Sadato told you

287
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:44,761
Do you believe this nonsense

288
00:16:44,761 --> 00:16:45,320
of course

289
00:16:45,841 --> 00:16:47,160
I wouldn't exist without God

290
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:48,361
This world doesn't exist

291
00:16:48,961 --> 00:16:50,121
How could she lie to me

292
00:16:50,121 --> 00:16:51,680
Then you might as well ask your god

293
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,440
If he can save you

294
00:16:53,881 --> 00:16:54,680
Save sentient beings

295
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,481
Why Insatiable People Get What They Want

296
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:02,560
Those who despise human life are in charge of life and death

297
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,241
The poor are bullied

298
00:17:05,241 --> 00:17:06,680
The good are trampled on

299
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,481
Rigid person

300
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:10,961
Forced to kneel down and beg for mercy

301
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:23,280
Couldn't he hear those or the top of his lungs

302
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,080
Or a silent cry for help

303
00:17:26,360 --> 00:17:27,681
When you lost your family

304
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,481
Where is your god

305
00:17:29,481 --> 00:17:30,681
That's enough, don't say anything more

306
00:17:35,681 --> 00:17:36,201
Damn it

307
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:45,880
Seven seven

308
00:17:50,001 --> 00:17:52,040
The god who can save all beings in this world

309
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:57,961
Only yourself

310
00:18:06,241 --> 00:18:07,080
Maybe

311
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:10,080
nowadays

312
00:18:11,921 --> 00:18:13,800
It's time for me to make atonement
