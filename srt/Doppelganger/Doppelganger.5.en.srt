1
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:50,040
So tired

2
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:52,400
Why don't you be here

3
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:54,919
Just bury me

4
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:58,680
To bury you here

5
00:00:59,119 --> 00:01:00,159
Where is your friend lying

6
00:01:35,719 --> 00:01:36,400
Adie

7
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:38,680
You have a family

8
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:50,199
I'll give you one day to get justice

9
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,639
Midnight tonight

10
00:01:53,199 --> 00:01:54,119
You and I are done

11
00:02:09,279 --> 00:02:10,199
I owe you my life

12
00:02:11,320 --> 00:02:12,240
Midnight tonight

13
00:02:13,919 --> 00:02:14,559
I'll pay you back

14
00:02:31,799 --> 00:02:34,320
I originally wanted to follow her to have a better future

15
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:35,600
But she ruined her face

16
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,160
What a waste of effort

17
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:39,880
And so on

18
00:02:41,479 --> 00:02:42,280
What's wrong

19
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,639
You

20
00:02:48,399 --> 00:02:49,799
You you hit me

21
00:02:50,639 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm the master

22
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,919
You're a servant

23
00:02:53,079 --> 00:02:53,840
It's you who hit

24
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:54,799
Get on your knees

25
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,919
Didn't my wife say that

26
00:02:59,320 --> 00:03:00,639
Is equal for all

27
00:03:01,359 --> 00:03:02,919
I can sell you

28
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,600
Why should I be equal to you

29
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,399
a form of address for one's wife

30
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:07,959
Don't sell me I'm wrong

31
00:03:08,079 --> 00:03:09,959
I really know the wrong lady

32
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,600
Treat you ancient people

33
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,919
It should be done in the way you ancient people

34
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,880
It's long overdue

35
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,320
Prime Minister

36
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:33,079
What are you doing

37
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,840
Go go go go

38
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:36,560
I know the whereabouts of my grandson

39
00:03:37,199 --> 00:03:38,760
Want to make a deal with the Prime Minister

40
00:03:39,359 --> 00:03:40,239
absurd

41
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,519
How could you possibly know

42
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,560
Chance is a long story

43
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:44,840
This matter is of great importance

44
00:03:44,919 --> 00:03:46,359
I absolutely dare not deceive the Prime Minister

45
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:51,880
What do you want

46
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,720
I want to ask the Prime Minister to help me get rid of someone

47
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,479
Someone who means nothing to you

48
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,440
Who

49
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,600
A fake that wants to replace me

50
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,919
With a suspect

51
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:16,399
But he attacked you

52
00:04:16,679 --> 00:04:18,280
And killed the refugee Adie

53
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,519
Back to Zhizhou

54
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:20,919
It was him

55
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:23,959
Empress Huzi is afraid

56
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,399
Report to Zhizhou

57
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:28,680
This Ma Ruhu has a brain problem since he was a child

58
00:04:28,719 --> 00:04:30,079
Getting mad from time to time

59
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:30,959
Get sick

60
00:04:30,959 --> 00:04:32,360
It's hard to control myself

61
00:04:32,719 --> 00:04:34,920
He attacked the woman yesterday

62
00:04:35,159 --> 00:04:36,480
Not intentionally

63
00:04:36,719 --> 00:04:38,320
But insane

64
00:04:38,719 --> 00:04:40,560
I have Dr. Chengnan Wang here

65
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,079
Diagnosis of madness given to Ma Ruhu

66
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,880
Present it up and see

67
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,279
Nice

68
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,480
According to the laws and regulations of our court

69
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:57,920
Perpetrator of madness

70
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:59,760
No imprisonment or execution

71
00:05:00,159 --> 00:05:02,079
Order Ma Ruhu's family

72
00:05:02,399 --> 00:05:04,120
Take him home and imprison him

73
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:05,719
Do not release

74
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,959
People's women refuse to accept it

75
00:05:07,839 --> 00:05:08,680
He's playing crazy

76
00:05:09,079 --> 00:05:10,680
He was clearly awake last night

77
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:12,760
You woman

78
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,399
You're skin-to-skin

79
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:15,880
It's disgraceful

80
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:18,000
Do you have to make it known all over the city

81
00:05:18,599 --> 00:05:19,320
let alone

82
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:21,320
It was just a madwoman who died

83
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,079
Withdrawal

84
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:54,159
It is said that Ma Ruhu was acquitted

85
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,120
Acquittal

86
00:06:00,159 --> 00:06:02,959
It seems that the people behind Ma Ruhu have a lot of background

87
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:04,959
Where is Jiang Song now

88
00:06:05,839 --> 00:06:06,760
I'm being too careless

89
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,880
Let her escape

90
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:09,680
She's not gonna run

91
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:11,399
So she

92
00:06:17,519 --> 00:06:18,760
Why is he here

93
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:19,639
It's him

94
00:06:22,159 --> 00:06:23,279
Eat whatever you want, eat whatever you want

95
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:25,199
Come and have a look, guest

96
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,719
Come on, come on, come and see

97
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:30,719
Just look, just look

98
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:11,599
Animal

99
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,560
I was so excited that I stayed up all night last night

100
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,279
Killing people can be so interesting

101
00:07:19,719 --> 00:07:22,240
That madman deserves his death

102
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,800
Well played

103
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:31,199
Come on, come and hit me

104
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,920
Fight quickly

105
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,800
Deserve it

106
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:39,959
I'll make you feel good before you die

107
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:41,480
Let me go

108
00:07:42,959 --> 00:07:45,079
Let me go, let me go

109
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:46,800
Let me go

110
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,079
Let go

111
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:01,519
Become

112
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,800
Go collect the body

113
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:03,839
Yes

114
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,240
Nothing but that

115
00:08:59,679 --> 00:09:00,279
How

116
00:09:00,919 --> 00:09:01,679
How could it be

117
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,679
Excuse me

118
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,360
Forgot to tell you

119
00:09:11,559 --> 00:09:13,720
I smeared myself with poison

120
00:09:14,919 --> 00:09:15,919
To be precise

121
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:19,080
It's a medicine specially used to kill animals in the countryside

122
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:20,960
It's just right for you, isn't it

123
00:09:22,159 --> 00:09:22,840
By the way

124
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,880
Are you feeling good

125
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:28,559
You can't kill me

126
00:09:28,760 --> 00:09:29,960
The god is watching you

127
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,720
Yeah

128
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:37,000
God crosses everyone

129
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:42,319
How can you kill someone right under his nose

130
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,720
Give me a chance

131
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,439
I won't do it again

132
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:49,760
I

133
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:53,880
This way

134
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:55,480
I can't see it

135
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:58,960
Where to go

136
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,559
Go find your mother to change your diaper

137
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:12,439
Rescue

138
00:10:13,039 --> 00:10:13,679
Hush

139
00:11:20,279 --> 00:11:22,799
Don't you want to live before your childhood comes

140
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:27,720
Jiang Song

141
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:30,840
Why don't you want to live

142
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:33,639
How nice it is to be alive

143
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:40,600
You don't know how hard I've worked for all these years

144
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,159
How hard you want to live

145
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,639
This world

146
00:11:47,679 --> 00:11:48,840
Life is worthless

147
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:54,159
But I still cherish my life

148
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:02,240
They always say wait for the next life

149
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,439
Talk about selling flowers in this life

150
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,360
Beautiful in the afterlife

151
00:12:09,039 --> 00:12:09,960
Afterlife

152
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:12,799
Afterlife

153
00:12:14,919 --> 00:12:16,080
Will there really be

154
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:37,559
The time has arrived

155
00:12:39,639 --> 00:12:40,559
It's time to break

156
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,000
Life

157
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:48,559
Give it back to you

158
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:01,000
Don't take action again

159
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,559
I'm gonna regret it

160
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,200
We're gonna break it

161
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,439
Is there only hatred

162
00:13:37,919 --> 00:13:40,080
This kid was an orphan since childhood

163
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:41,519
Eat a hundred meals and grow up

164
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,760
He has brute force but he is a nerd

165
00:13:44,439 --> 00:13:45,720
Kick from this house to that

166
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:47,360
And finally came to me

167
00:13:48,319 --> 00:13:48,960
rubbish

168
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,720
Go with your new master

169
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,120
Be a good dog

170
00:13:52,439 --> 00:13:54,919
Please ask her to sell you in a good place next time

171
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,720
You boy

172
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:00,080
I already gave you the money

173
00:14:03,399 --> 00:14:04,039
go

174
00:14:10,519 --> 00:14:11,120
Thank you

175
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,480
And you're free

176
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,279
What are you running for

177
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:28,360
The doctor said everything

178
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,159
You will die if you don't recover well

179
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,960
The doctor said he had never seen anyone as miserable as you

180
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,679
There is no good flesh all over my body

181
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,559
You haven't eaten or drunk in a long time

182
00:14:38,840 --> 00:14:40,919
I'll cook whatever you want

183
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,519
I'll catch whatever medicine you want

184
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:44,399
You can't leave

185
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:50,360
And then what

186
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,559
What and then

187
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,799
When your pity is exhausted

188
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,319
When your superiority is satisfied

189
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:57,319
What are you talking about

190
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,639
What do you mean

191
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,319
And sell me to the next owner, right

192
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,399
I won't sell you

193
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:06,080
I'm not your master

194
00:15:06,080 --> 00:15:07,240
And you're not my slave

195
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:08,120
We're friends

196
00:15:10,679 --> 00:15:11,399
Don't leave

197
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,519
Get out of the way

198
00:15:12,600 --> 00:15:14,159
I can't

199
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:16,519
You run once and I chase you once

200
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:19,439
If you run a hundred times, I will chase you a hundred times, a thousand times

201
00:15:28,799 --> 00:15:30,039
I won't give up on you

202
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,240
Rest assured

203
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,080
Shen Que

204
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:53,000
Shen Que

205
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,919
Candied haws

206
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,080
I found you

207
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,760
Candied haws

208
00:16:19,919 --> 00:16:22,480
Don't miss it when you pass by

209
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,480
Come again

210
00:16:27,159 --> 00:16:30,760
Fruit Fresh fruit

211
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:33,159
Come and have a look

212
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,319
Looking for what

213
00:16:35,919 --> 00:16:37,720
When I find you, you'll have to come back with me

214
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:38,720
You are not allowed to cheat

215
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:39,480
You promised me

216
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,200
When did I promise you

217
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,120
Then I don't care

218
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,159
Let go where are you going

219
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:44,880
No, you have to come back with me

220
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
I'm not going back

221
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:47,120
Where are you going

222
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,599
I admit that your hide-and-seek skills have improved

223
00:17:53,319 --> 00:17:53,760
But

224
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,000
I'll always find you

225
00:17:58,760 --> 00:17:59,440
Invite you to eat

226
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,160
So sweet

227
00:18:34,839 --> 00:18:35,480
Is it delicious

228
00:18:41,879 --> 00:18:44,000
I found you, Jiang Song

229
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:47,359
Five years of hide-and-seek is over
