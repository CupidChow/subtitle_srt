1
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:55,041
You dare kidnap me

2
00:00:55,321 --> 00:00:56,041
Your Majesty

3
00:00:56,401 --> 00:00:58,240
There are many people in the uterus with miscellaneous eyes

4
00:00:59,081 --> 00:01:01,120
I can only help you come here

5
00:01:09,641 --> 00:01:12,560
Your Majesty, please make an edict of abdication

6
00:01:13,161 --> 00:01:16,720
Located in the seventh prince of the youngest son of the queen mother

7
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:20,480
Seventh Prince

8
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,920
But nine years old

9
00:01:24,401 --> 00:01:26,521
It's also an easy puppet to control

10
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:33,801
Your Majesty, your Majesty, help me

11
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:35,560
Your Majesty I don't want to die, Your Majesty

12
00:01:35,761 --> 00:01:36,560
Your Majesty

13
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:39,640
Every stick of incense will kill a civilian

14
00:01:39,881 --> 00:01:40,920
You dare

15
00:01:41,521 --> 00:01:42,601
Hold it fast

16
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,321
Your Majesty

17
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:48,881
Please, your Majesty

18
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:51,200
I'm still in the capital

19
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:52,720
How dare they rebel

20
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,521
Follow me to East Camp

21
00:01:55,041 --> 00:01:56,801
Bring Li Dacheng's soldiers into the palace to escort him

22
00:01:57,441 --> 00:01:58,041
Zhang Chao

23
00:01:58,041 --> 00:01:58,801
Where is he

24
00:01:58,801 --> 00:01:59,840
Zhang Chao, don't let him run

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,881
You are going to rebel today

26
00:02:00,961 --> 00:02:03,480
We, our defenceless civilians, also fought with you

27
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:05,840
Who said I was going to rebel

28
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,000
I saw it with my own eyes

29
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
The rebels are flying your Zhang Chao banner

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,521
Shen is indeed under your orders

31
00:02:10,521 --> 00:02:11,761
And killed so many people

32
00:02:11,761 --> 00:02:12,961
Isn't it for today

33
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:14,000
Yes, yes

34
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,800
We all saw it

35
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,240
We saw killings

36
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,841
Still quibbling? It's too much

37
00:02:18,841 --> 00:02:19,640
Fuck off

38
00:02:20,161 --> 00:02:21,601
I don't want to talk crap to you

39
00:02:21,601 --> 00:02:23,321
Dear neighbors, we as

40
00:02:23,321 --> 00:02:24,360
Zhao's descendants

41
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:25,960
I want to sacrifice my life for righteousness today

42
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,520
Get out of the way

43
00:02:27,721 --> 00:02:29,841
You kill, you kill

44
00:02:29,841 --> 00:02:32,480
So many people have lost their lives

45
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,800
It's not a few of us

46
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:34,640
Yeah, it is

47
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,960
No, I'll kill us all

48
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:37,721
They all killed

49
00:02:38,001 --> 00:02:38,680
Kill

50
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,680
You kill

51
00:02:39,881 --> 00:02:41,520
If you kill us all, you do

52
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:43,841
Come on, come, kill, kill them all

53
00:02:44,041 --> 00:02:45,001
Kill us

54
00:02:45,001 --> 00:02:47,841
Do it right, kill, kill

55
00:02:47,841 --> 00:02:48,841
Get out of the way

56
00:02:58,920 --> 00:02:59,520
This

57
00:03:02,601 --> 00:03:03,121
General

58
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,041
Zhang Chao

59
00:03:08,441 --> 00:03:09,281
What's going on

60
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,881
It seems that it is really not General Zhang who rebelled

61
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,321
But he is tyrannical

62
00:03:13,601 --> 00:03:14,680
Killed so many people

63
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,041
Good and evil are rewarded

64
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,400
He should pay for his life

65
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,841
Just did so many bad things

66
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:22,080
Can it be offset by doing a good deed

67
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:23,561
That's right, but you said he

68
00:03:23,561 --> 00:03:24,321
adoptive mother

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,281
adoptive mother

70
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,721
Unexpectedly

71
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:33,161
I, Zhang Chao, didn't die on the battlefield

72
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:37,321
But to die in the land I guard

73
00:03:37,480 --> 00:03:38,240
adoptive mother

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,001
Que'er

75
00:03:42,761 --> 00:03:43,800
So many years

76
00:03:45,001 --> 00:03:46,080
If it weren't you

77
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:50,721
The foster father will kill more people in vain

78
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:54,281
Father, thank you

79
00:03:54,761 --> 00:03:55,800
I'm wrong

80
00:03:56,841 --> 00:03:58,561
I shouldn't be soft-hearted

81
00:03:59,441 --> 00:04:00,200
Que'er

82
00:04:01,281 --> 00:04:02,161
You remember

83
00:04:03,721 --> 00:04:06,161
Let the world judge right and wrong

84
00:04:07,321 --> 00:04:10,601
Only you stick to your heart

85
00:04:12,561 --> 00:04:14,281
I am not a good person

86
00:04:15,601 --> 00:04:17,001
Deserves to go to hell

87
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:18,721
But you

88
00:04:19,441 --> 00:04:20,321
You're different

89
00:04:21,920 --> 00:04:23,001
You're different

90
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,200
adoptive mother

91
00:04:26,921 --> 00:04:27,720
Zhang Chao

92
00:04:27,921 --> 00:04:28,720
adoptive mother

93
00:04:30,321 --> 00:04:31,121
adoptive mother

94
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:34,481
adoptive mother

95
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,801
Your Majesty, help us

96
00:05:13,561 --> 00:05:15,001
Your Majesty

97
00:05:15,681 --> 00:05:17,561
Don't kill me

98
00:05:18,001 --> 00:05:20,200
Help the grass people

99
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:22,681
General can't

100
00:05:22,881 --> 00:05:23,520
roll

101
00:05:23,761 --> 00:05:25,561
General, you never kill civilians

102
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:26,561
You'll regret it

103
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:39,520
Shen Que, remember

104
00:05:39,881 --> 00:05:41,681
No matter what happens in the future

105
00:05:42,561 --> 00:05:43,801
Even if everyone

106
00:05:44,361 --> 00:05:45,441
All leave you

107
00:05:46,561 --> 00:05:47,720
They turned their backs on you

108
00:05:48,561 --> 00:05:49,881
Don't forget who you are

109
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:51,280
Is it okay

110
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,801
Fairy Sister

111
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,881
It's her

112
00:06:19,121 --> 00:06:20,080
And you're free

113
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:30,080
It turns out that it's Jiang Song from beginning to end

114
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,321
Dr. Li

115
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,001
If you want to serve your country

116
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:47,441
Go to Dongdaying and find Li Dacheng

117
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:48,921
Enter the palace to rescue the driver

118
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:50,481
Good

119
00:07:08,881 --> 00:07:09,840
Your Majesty, save me

120
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:11,241
Your Majesty, save me

121
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,080
Don't kill

122
00:07:13,441 --> 00:07:14,040
I write

123
00:07:15,681 --> 00:07:16,400
I write

124
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:32,840
What is this

125
00:08:33,481 --> 00:08:36,801
This was when the former prince investigated the night walkers

126
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:39,201
The Yun Yong Order taken from the Queen Mother

127
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:42,121
This is the cloud surge order

128
00:08:42,841 --> 00:08:43,800
great

129
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,601
Clouds surge to make a fire

130
00:08:45,841 --> 00:08:47,961
Another midnight traveler will be here soon

131
00:08:48,121 --> 00:08:49,601
You'an, get it here quickly

132
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:51,601
Jiang Jiaojiao

133
00:08:53,201 --> 00:08:54,320
I'm not Jiang Jiaojiao

134
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:58,761
I am

135
00:09:01,361 --> 00:09:02,081
Jiang Song

136
00:09:15,961 --> 00:09:16,520
You

137
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:17,160
You

138
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:18,841
Your Majesty

139
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,721
Your Majesty, you must not compromise

140
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,361
Shen will surely come to save us

141
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:27,961
And so on

142
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:29,320
Your Majesty

143
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:32,081
A stick of incense is almost finished

144
00:09:33,961 --> 00:09:34,560
I write

145
00:09:34,841 --> 00:09:36,121
Your Majesty doesn't want it

146
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:01,241
Finished writing

147
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,201
Leave them alone

148
00:10:06,121 --> 00:10:06,680
Prime Minister

149
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,361
Shen was seriously injured

150
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:10,201
We can finish

151
00:10:10,841 --> 00:10:11,440
Good

152
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:17,280
Even if there is no Yunyong Order

153
00:10:17,841 --> 00:10:20,800
The world is still mine

154
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:29,841
You An

155
00:10:30,761 --> 00:10:31,361
go

156
00:10:33,640 --> 00:10:34,121
go

157
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:38,040
Congratulations

158
00:10:38,761 --> 00:10:40,440
The story is finally coming to an end

159
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:44,761
What do you mean

160
00:10:45,201 --> 00:10:47,680
The world is actually a story

161
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:48,961
You're the leading man

162
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:49,961
The favored son of heaven

163
00:10:51,121 --> 00:10:51,961
Male leading actor

164
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:53,361
right

165
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,841
And Jiang Jiaojiao is the heroine

166
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
Your loot

167
00:11:00,040 --> 00:11:00,920
Except yourself

168
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:02,241
No one can hurt your life

169
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,121
So she tried to kill you repeatedly

170
00:11:04,361 --> 00:11:05,481
You survived

171
00:11:05,881 --> 00:11:06,680
Amazing, isn't it

172
00:11:17,241 --> 00:11:18,121
Shen Que

173
00:11:18,761 --> 00:11:20,400
The edict of abdication has been issued

174
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:22,800
Why do you have to resist

175
00:11:27,081 --> 00:11:28,361
Everything you need

176
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:30,520
When you were created by God

177
00:11:30,841 --> 00:11:32,001
Just being favored

178
00:11:32,201 --> 00:11:33,280
Just have everything

179
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,001
What are the shortcomings

180
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:37,481
To put it so

181
00:11:38,121 --> 00:11:41,361
My life has been a farce from beginning to end

182
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,520
You should understand it as your legend

183
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:51,440
But why is it me

184
00:11:53,721 --> 00:11:54,601
Does this matter

185
00:11:56,201 --> 00:11:56,961
Why

186
00:11:58,361 --> 00:12:00,601
Actually, there is no reason

187
00:12:04,961 --> 00:12:06,241
I'm empty here

188
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:08,680
Getting empty

189
00:12:10,121 --> 00:12:11,881
No matter what, it can't be filled

190
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,841
What am I doing wrong

191
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,280
Heaven wants to treat me like this

192
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,001
Lang Jun did nothing wrong

193
00:12:19,481 --> 00:12:21,201
Everything is a trick of nature

194
00:12:21,601 --> 00:12:22,160
NO

195
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:24,841
There must be a reason

196
00:12:26,081 --> 00:12:27,400
There must be a reason

197
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,520
It turns out there's really no reason

198
00:12:31,961 --> 00:12:32,640
What about the cicada girl

199
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:34,961
Why must she die

200
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:36,481
Cicada Niang

201
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,121
Which cicada girl

202
00:12:38,761 --> 00:12:40,040
My real mother

203
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,040
The woman

204
00:12:43,560 --> 00:12:44,320
It's nothing

205
00:12:44,841 --> 00:12:47,160
Probably for your childhood memories

206
00:12:47,160 --> 00:12:48,121
Add some color

207
00:12:48,881 --> 00:12:52,001
So she died for me

208
00:12:54,280 --> 00:12:55,280
Do you care

209
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:57,601
Yeah

210
00:12:58,560 --> 00:12:59,400
I don't care

211
00:13:00,201 --> 00:13:01,201
I have everything I need

212
00:13:03,121 --> 00:13:03,920
amusing

213
00:13:05,121 --> 00:13:06,201
It's interesting

214
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:09,721
Let me see

215
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,160
What else am I short of

216
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,280
You've got what you want

217
00:13:17,001 --> 00:13:17,721
Leave them alone

218
00:13:18,201 --> 00:13:20,040
If you want to kill me, kill me

219
00:13:21,361 --> 00:13:22,081
Do you hear that

220
00:13:22,481 --> 00:13:24,040
Your masters are bowing their heads

221
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:26,081
Aren't you throwing up

222
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,761
Lao Tzu is partial

223
00:13:33,001 --> 00:13:33,680
Shen Que

224
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:40,841
Jiang Song

225
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,081
How can you miss it

226
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,841
What about the wonderful picture of his death

227
00:13:46,601 --> 00:13:47,761
Look how pitiful he is

228
00:13:50,121 --> 00:13:51,560
Why don't you give him a ride

229
00:14:37,081 --> 00:14:37,841
Don't cry

230
00:14:58,640 --> 00:14:59,920
Your butterfly embroidery is crooked

231
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:02,481
Fairy Sister

232
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,481
Don't look back

233
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,121
Forget me

234
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:21,400
You An

235
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:21,961
Don't rush

236
00:15:38,761 --> 00:15:40,121
Sure enough it can't kill me

237
00:15:41,121 --> 00:15:42,320
It's amazing

238
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:44,560
You

239
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,800
I've given two people my heart

240
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:49,800
Cicada Mother died for me

241
00:15:50,881 --> 00:15:51,481
And you

242
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:53,841
But you want me dead

243
00:15:54,280 --> 00:15:55,800
Push me to a desperate situation

244
00:15:58,001 --> 00:15:59,481
This is what you mean

245
00:16:00,121 --> 00:16:00,761
NO

246
00:16:02,241 --> 00:16:03,601
This is my sincerity

247
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,400
You see

248
00:16:25,361 --> 00:16:26,440
I'm not empty

249
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,680
I learned to love people

250
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:32,280
I'm no longer a monster

251
00:16:34,841 --> 00:16:35,961
I am not a monster

252
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,280
Kill

253
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,800
The final general Li Dacheng was late to rescue him

254
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,481
After I die

255
00:16:54,761 --> 00:16:56,320
Put a river lamp for me

256
00:16:56,881 --> 00:16:57,481
Is it okay

257
00:16:57,961 --> 00:16:58,481
Do not move

258
00:16:59,201 --> 00:16:59,841
Be honest

259
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,161
It's okay

260
00:17:35,401 --> 00:17:37,040
No matter No matter

261
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,120
It can still be repaired, it can be repaired

262
00:17:41,641 --> 00:17:42,320
God

263
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:45,241
I am your most true disciple

264
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,681
I would sacrifice my life

265
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,080
Punish the untamed for you

266
00:18:22,921 --> 00:18:23,560
Jiang Song

267
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,721
Who are you

268
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:26,241
Who are you

269
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:30,761
Who are you

270
00:18:30,961 --> 00:18:32,040
I am

271
00:18:33,161 --> 00:18:34,161
Ginger

272
00:18:36,721 --> 00:18:37,401
Jiang Song

273
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:39,080
Jiang Song

274
00:18:47,761 --> 00:18:48,681
I am

275
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,120
Jiang Jiaojiao
