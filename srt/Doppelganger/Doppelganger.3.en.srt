1
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,320
Stop faking it

2
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:02,320
You want to take my place and marry Choi Woo-an

3
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:04,199
Dreaming

4
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,199
You're lucky

5
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:13,440
I didn't expect you to survive this time

6
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:17,960
You're crazy

7
00:01:18,639 --> 00:01:19,880
Your fault again

8
00:01:21,160 --> 00:01:23,279
It's not me, it's your brother

9
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:26,119
Want to ask me why I know

10
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:27,919
Because I can predict

11
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:29,279
How is this possible

12
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,440
How can it be impossible

13
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:32,240
Both of your sisters showed up

14
00:01:32,279 --> 00:01:33,440
What else is impossible

15
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,520
I also know the test questions for next spring exam

16
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:40,760
You go gamble

17
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:42,960
Isn't it just to collect money to buy the spring examination questions

18
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:43,999
You know that too

19
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,559
I told him that was just to protect myself

20
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,240
I didn't know he let me go

21
00:01:53,359 --> 00:01:54,680
But I sold you to a ghost marriage

22
00:01:55,199 --> 00:01:56,199
None of my business

23
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:57,800
I'm not like you

24
00:01:59,359 --> 00:02:00,320
I have a bottom line

25
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,120
What are you doing

26
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:23,479
Yaozu

27
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,440
Yaozu

28
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:27,040
He's gonna sell me for a ghost marriage

29
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,320
That's Yaozu's fault

30
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:30,079
But you're a sister

31
00:02:30,199 --> 00:02:31,679
He respected you and loved you since childhood

32
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:34,160
He will change if you discipline him more

33
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,880
Jiang Song

34
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:37,799
Good

35
00:02:39,399 --> 00:02:40,199
I'll discipline

36
00:02:42,359 --> 00:02:42,959
Jiang Yaozu

37
00:02:43,479 --> 00:02:44,359
What are you gonna do

38
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:46,440
He was reported as intending to bribe the examiner

39
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:47,799
We were ordered to capture

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,479
I don't have

41
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,239
Wronged, my son is a scholar

42
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:53,440
How could he do that sort of thing

43
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,799
Stop talking nonsense and get it for me

44
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:55,639
Yes Yes

45
00:02:55,639 --> 00:02:56,959
What are you doing?

46
00:02:57,519 --> 00:02:57,840
go

47
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,760
Don't want my son

48
00:02:58,760 --> 00:02:59,760
Mother, don't move

49
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,639
Niang Yaozu

50
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,679
Save me

51
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,040
Mrs. Yiu Cho

52
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:06,880
You reported the official

53
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,679
Jiaojiao, go and tell them

54
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:13,280
Yaozu was wronged, go quickly

55
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:15,679
Mother

56
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:19,160
I'm wronged too

57
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,519
Yaozu, don't be afraid of Madam

58
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:27,479
My mother will rescue you if she lost everything

59
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,040
Yaozu, my son

60
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:33,519
Wrong, madam

61
00:03:33,679 --> 00:03:35,479
Madam was wronged

62
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,199
My son

63
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:36,679
Mother

64
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:37,880
Don't touch me

65
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,560
Yaozu

66
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,600
Yaozu

67
00:04:08,679 --> 00:04:11,399
Everyone in the world knows that gods are good

68
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:14,840
Only children and grandchildren can't forget it

69
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,799
Your Majesty's children and grandchildren are all dragons and phoenixes among people

70
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:19,040
The pillar of the country

71
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:20,600
You know nothing

72
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,240
He said he was victimized by an adulterer

73
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:51,880
Take a hunger strike to be full of integrity

74
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:03,639
Hungry

75
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:05,440
Immune to the food that comes

76
00:06:06,719 --> 00:06:07,279
very good

77
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:09,039
three

78
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,120
two

79
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:11,399
One wait

80
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:15,000
I am hungry

81
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:36,599
Dare to play with me

82
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,680
Believe it or not I'll kill you

83
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,440
I used to go hungry

84
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,599
No matter how hard life is, it will never be short, you

85
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,320
You should taste that, too

86
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,079
Is it my fault that the family is tight

87
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:53,760
You think I don't have a heavy burden on me

88
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:55,279
You hide at home every day

89
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,880
I don't know all the ups and downs out there

90
00:06:57,159 --> 00:06:58,560
Which sister doesn't help his younger brother

91
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,320
You're so selfish

92
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:03,760
General Shen General Shen

93
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:28,120
stop

94
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,680
What are you running for

95
00:07:35,959 --> 00:07:36,800
Hello again

96
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:41,599
I still like your wedding dress last night

97
00:07:43,880 --> 00:07:45,199
The civilian girl has seen the general

98
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:49,800
That's your brother

99
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,000
Someone drag him down

100
00:07:55,320 --> 00:07:55,719
Yes

101
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,199
Sister, go

102
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,519
You have to save me, sister

103
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:03,440
Sister, hurry up

104
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:05,240
Sister

105
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:06,719
Save me, sister

106
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:08,199
General, what do you mean?

107
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,199
I'm curious

108
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:12,680
Jiang Niangzi

109
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:15,440
In your heart

110
00:08:16,760 --> 00:08:18,039
What is most important

111
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,680
Your family

112
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:21,639
Yourself

113
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,719
Or Choi You-an

114
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,279
The civilian girl doesn't know what the general means

115
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:34,680
Scholar Cui blocked your arrow last night

116
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:38,639
A man would die for a woman

117
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:40,799
I'm touched

118
00:08:42,799 --> 00:08:44,439
If this woman is indifferent

119
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,960
How hard-hearted it is

120
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,360
Are you right

121
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,679
Right

122
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,360
Young Master Cui's affection for me

123
00:08:54,919 --> 00:08:56,080
I want to cherish it

124
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,080
Good

125
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:07,720
very good

126
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,279
Amo

127
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:11,000
General

128
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,480
Give him a taste of all the torture instruments

129
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,080
You imprisoned yourself

130
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,559
Don't let him die too fast

131
00:09:17,679 --> 00:09:18,120
Yes

132
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:24,799
Let me ask you one last time

133
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:26,600
Who do you choose

134
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:33,480
The civilian girl does not understand what the general means

135
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,600
Ask the general to make it clear

136
00:09:50,639 --> 00:09:51,279
Good

137
00:09:52,159 --> 00:09:53,000
I'll be straight

138
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,279
Your Majesty ordered me and Cui You'an

139
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:56,399
Looking for the lost imperial grandson

140
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,159
Let me know if he's moving

141
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,120
I'll spare your brother's life

142
00:10:03,439 --> 00:10:04,120
Talk

143
00:10:10,159 --> 00:10:10,880
People's women don't want to

144
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:12,399
Please help yourself

145
00:10:41,279 --> 00:10:43,799
I traveled into the novel "Pampered"

146
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,319
The beginning of the story

147
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,480
Jiang Song, a scheming girl at the bottom of the heart

148
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,120
Climbing the flower of the high mountain Cui You-an

149
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:52,960
But he accidentally burned to death before his wedding

150
00:10:54,200 --> 00:10:55,919
Modern girl Jiang Jiaojiao

151
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:57,200
Which is me

152
00:10:57,639 --> 00:10:58,919
Crossing into the fire

153
00:10:59,279 --> 00:11:01,200
Being rescued as an ancient woman

154
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,000
Marry first and then love her destined male protagonist

155
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:09,039
Counter-attack life

156
00:11:09,799 --> 00:11:10,600
Perfect

157
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,319
Except

158
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:15,240
The ancient woman is not dead now

159
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,799
Will this change the plot

160
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,720
The next plot should be

161
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,159
Cui You'an sent an invitation to Jiang Jiaojiao

162
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,080
Prime Minister's Banquet

163
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:34,399
Where's my invitation

164
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:47,360
Cui Yongzi

165
00:11:48,840 --> 00:11:49,639
Why are you here

166
00:11:50,439 --> 00:11:51,840
I heard about your brother going to prison

167
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,399
Need some help

168
00:11:55,519 --> 00:11:56,039
No need

169
00:11:56,679 --> 00:11:57,840
He should suffer a little too

170
00:11:58,880 --> 00:11:59,360
By the way

171
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,880
Father's birthday party tomorrow

172
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:01,720
Aunt will come

173
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,399
She said she wanted to see you

174
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:06,880
I

175
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:08,080
a form of address for one's wife

176
00:12:08,559 --> 00:12:10,039
That's the queen

177
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:12,760
Here's the invitation

178
00:12:14,439 --> 00:12:15,240
Thank you, Master Cui

179
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:16,559
My wife will come

180
00:12:24,039 --> 00:12:24,679
a form of address for one's wife

181
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,919
We have to dress up when we go to the Prime Minister's Mansion

182
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:35,600
A little butterfly flew across Guanyin Bridge

183
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:37,639
Little butterfly

184
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,039
Fly

185
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:44,399
give

186
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,760
Crazy for so many years

187
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,399
It's pitiful

188
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:58,679
Fortunately, I have a wife and you have been helping me

189
00:13:01,880 --> 00:13:03,679
Eat slowly, what else

190
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:25,639
Dead child

191
00:13:31,799 --> 00:13:32,319
give

192
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:33,799
Go for it

193
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,880
So easy to deal with

194
00:13:39,319 --> 00:13:40,559
This Jiang Song

195
00:13:41,319 --> 00:13:43,519
As expected of the original cannon fodder that I replaced

196
00:13:45,039 --> 00:13:47,000
I was supposed to be the heroine

197
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,080
control

198
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,360
Yaozu

199
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,960
Yaozu is the only seedling of my Jiang family

200
00:13:58,960 --> 00:13:59,559
Mother

201
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,639
How can I live up to my ancestors

202
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,760
It's all over it's all over

203
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,360
She made you like this

204
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,880
She wants to dig out her mother's heart

205
00:14:20,039 --> 00:14:21,319
This is not a game

206
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:22,880
Lost

207
00:14:23,840 --> 00:14:24,559
Will die

208
00:14:25,720 --> 00:14:28,880
She's so cruel to her own brother

209
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:30,240
Can't stay at all

210
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,960
If you keep breaking, you will suffer from chaos

211
00:14:34,519 --> 00:14:36,120
I can't be soft-hearted anymore

212
00:14:46,760 --> 00:14:47,439
Yeah

213
00:14:50,559 --> 00:14:52,240
This dress really matches you

214
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,840
Yeah, I like this mercury best

215
00:14:58,039 --> 00:14:58,679
Prime Minister

216
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,639
Assistant Minister Li, Prince and the others have all arrived

217
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:01,840
Congratulations

218
00:15:01,919 --> 00:15:02,439
Please inside

219
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:05,799
Congratulations

220
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:15,360
Come and congratulate

221
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:18,399
Congratulations, Master Li, congratulations

222
00:15:18,799 --> 00:15:19,519
This way please

223
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:20,919
Please

224
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:21,760
Please, please

225
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,559
Your Majesty's body is getting worse and worse

226
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,799
At this juncture

227
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,559
He wants to find the descendants of the deposed prince

228
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,319
Don't you want another crown prince?

229
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:33,760
Empress, don't worry

230
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,960
The Third Prince's inheritance is destiny of heaven

231
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:39,960
Choi You-an

232
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:56,200
Merchant's daughter, bed-crawling bitch

233
00:15:56,519 --> 00:15:57,600
Also dress up as a noble lady

234
00:15:58,720 --> 00:15:59,799
That's vulgar

235
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:01,799
I can only show off some beauty and serve others

236
00:16:02,039 --> 00:16:03,319
According to the plot of the novel

237
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:04,480
Seize the night

238
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,840
Can make Choi You-an be tempted by me

239
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,039
Why is it you Lady Jiang

240
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,360
She couldn't come because of something

241
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:11,399
I'll take her place

242
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:13,399
No one can replace her

243
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,240
And no one can replace me

244
00:16:15,559 --> 00:16:16,120
You An

245
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:18,720
Is that the woman you mentioned

246
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:20,960
Let your aunt have a good look

247
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:24,720
Aunt She

248
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:25,480
Choi You-an

249
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,319
Do you want the Empress

250
00:16:28,319 --> 00:16:30,840
Do you know the strange thing about two Jiang Jiaojiao

251
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,159
You'an has loved running to Buddhist temples since childhood

252
00:16:40,159 --> 00:16:41,480
I'm afraid of him becoming a monk

253
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,200
I'm relieved to see you

254
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:44,200
By the way

255
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:46,399
What kind of birthday gift did Lady Jiang bring

256
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:48,200
Open our eyes

257
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,880
Could it be that you didn't bring anything

258
00:16:53,439 --> 00:16:55,120
Don't make it difficult for Miss Jiang

259
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:57,240
Prime Minister, what rare treasures have you never seen before

260
00:16:57,679 --> 00:16:58,639
That's what the words say

261
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:00,880
But you have to know some etiquette

262
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:03,000
Courtesy is light and affection is heavy

263
00:17:04,159 --> 00:17:05,039
Empress

264
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:06,439
Little girl has a gift

265
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,960
I'm afraid my gift will dazzle you

266
00:17:15,039 --> 00:17:15,519
Okay

267
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:17,799
And present it

268
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:20,680
Let me go

269
00:17:20,879 --> 00:17:21,640
Jiang Niangzi

270
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,440
You can't go to the banquet today

271
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:28,879
Go away, go away

272
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:30,879
Don't scream

273
00:17:32,920 --> 00:17:33,599
Be honest with me

274
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,279
Go away

275
00:17:35,839 --> 00:17:36,440
Let go

276
00:17:39,119 --> 00:17:39,920
Be honest with me

277
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:41,680
Let me go

278
00:17:45,519 --> 00:17:46,200
Mother

279
00:17:46,319 --> 00:17:47,920
I told you not to ask my mother to save me

280
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:50,119
Don't meddle in your own business, old man

281
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,200
Or I'll kill you

282
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,160
Get out of here

283
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,200
Mother

284
00:17:55,079 --> 00:17:55,799
Aniang

285
00:17:56,599 --> 00:17:57,599
If I die

286
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,599
Will you cry

287
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,519
Will you regret having abandoned me in fear

288
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,160
Will understand

289
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:08,559
Am I also a child who needs my mother's protection
