1
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:51,559
Jiang Niangzi

2
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:56,239
Your mind is not right

3
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:58,320
The gods and Buddhas will not be on your side

4
00:01:03,439 --> 00:01:04,199
Cui Yongzi

5
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,799
Lady Jiang, why are you here

6
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,520
I'll burn incense

7
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:13,160
Cui Yongzi

8
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:15,119
I have something I want to tell you

9
00:01:15,919 --> 00:01:16,839
Lady Jiang, please say

10
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:20,359
They all said

11
00:01:21,359 --> 00:01:22,839
I take advantage of your gentleman's heart

12
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,839
To cross my dream of wealth

13
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,999
Call me cheap

14
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,919
The heart is higher than the sky

15
00:01:29,279 --> 00:01:30,199
They talk nonsense

16
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,400
Who doesn't walk alone naked

17
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:37,359
The so-called Zhong Ding House

18
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,320
Seemingly scenery

19
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,680
But it's common to lose in the morning and in the evening

20
00:01:41,919 --> 00:01:43,559
If I hadn't taken advantage of my family

21
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,960
What kind of gentleman is he

22
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,520
But I made a mistake

23
00:01:48,999 --> 00:01:49,839
You really don't mind

24
00:01:49,839 --> 00:01:50,760
Why are you wrong

25
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,999
When your uncle forced you to marry someone you didn't want to

26
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,719
In desperation, you

27
00:01:57,999 --> 00:01:58,960
It's them who are wrong

28
00:01:59,719 --> 00:02:01,600
You have too many difficulties in this world

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:03,520
Buddha feeds eagles

30
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,359
Although I am an ordinary person

31
00:02:05,919 --> 00:02:07,240
I am willing to do my best

32
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,479
Crossing the lady once

33
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,359
All sentient beings suffer

34
00:02:11,479 --> 00:02:12,760
Why do you want to cross me

35
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:15,320
Because

36
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,720
You are all beings

37
00:02:22,199 --> 00:02:23,239
Buddha is above

38
00:02:24,399 --> 00:02:25,320
Be sincere

39
00:02:26,399 --> 00:02:27,440
Don't lie

40
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:30,000
of course

41
00:02:32,359 --> 00:02:33,199
I'll take you back

42
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:35,000
Good

43
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:44,840
Not yours

44
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,600
You can't hold it steadily if you want to

45
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:52,600
I've never seen a woman like you

46
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,679
Bright and flamboyant

47
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:55,959
As if fearless

48
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:57,479
Don't look forward and backward

49
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,560
In your old life

50
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,880
Don't you live very free

51
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,320
Of course

52
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:05,959
That's nice

53
00:03:06,639 --> 00:03:07,519
I've been a child

54
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:10,799
Never even left the city

55
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:12,440
Here it is

56
00:03:12,919 --> 00:03:14,079
To live like a human being

57
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,160
Is very difficult

58
00:03:17,359 --> 00:03:18,880
Don't always blame the bad environment

59
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:21,959
Sometimes you have to think about yourself

60
00:03:22,479 --> 00:03:23,440
Is it kind enough

61
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,880
Do you always help others

62
00:03:25,880 --> 00:03:27,199
Because I'm not kind enough

63
00:03:27,199 --> 00:03:28,359
Will be bullied

64
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:30,919
Interesting

65
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,280
I'd like to see

66
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,000
How do you influence others with kindness

67
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,560
Is alive

68
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:57,760
Scared me to death

69
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,840
This is too ruthless

70
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,799
Kindly remind you

71
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:05,919
This is not a game

72
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:07,399
Lost

73
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,880
Will die

74
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:14,399
Allow her to do so again

75
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:16,799
She'll hurt more people

76
00:04:25,760 --> 00:04:27,120
Sister eats

77
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,440
What's wrong

78
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,519
Nothing

79
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,440
Xie Yuanlang

80
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,240
You dare not pay my Li Wu's gambling debt

81
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:12,440
You wait until my sister enters the door of the Prime Minister's Mansion

82
00:05:12,760 --> 00:05:13,680
Of course I have money for you

83
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,719
Come on

84
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,839
The Prime Minister's House can make you a poor brother-in-law

85
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:18,079
How many autumn winds hit

86
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:19,399
listen

87
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:20,760
I did the math

88
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,480
Your sister matches my son's horoscope

89
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,519
Let her marry my son

90
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,079
Write off gambling debts

91
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:29,800
otherwise

92
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:30,880
Your scandal

93
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:33,760
Everyone will know it

94
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:35,240
Your son

95
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,880
Didn't your son already

96
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:39,639
Is he dead

97
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,680
What are you thinking, brother

98
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,760
Nothing

99
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,959
Look at her being frivolous and bold these days

100
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:12,480
Doesn't look like a real sister

101
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:13,880
Why don't you hand her over

102
00:06:16,719 --> 00:06:17,199
Sister

103
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:20,000
I see there are some juggling people out there

104
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,240
Sister, do you want to go see it

105
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:24,760
Yes, of course I do

106
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,159
It's smothering me here

107
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:27,599
Let's go

108
00:06:43,079 --> 00:06:44,480
I'm going out of this door

109
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,360
Will be kidnapped into a ghost marriage

110
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,480
My dear brother

111
00:06:48,719 --> 00:06:49,039
You

112
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:51,120
What do you call you sister

113
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:54,440
Sister

114
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,240
Sister, you have to save me, sister

115
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:57,519
Sister, open the door

116
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,199
Sister

117
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,000
You know what

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
That woman seems to be able to read minds

119
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,719
She's most likely a witch

120
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,760
And she said she wanted Yuanwai Li to hack me to death

121
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,120
You have to save me

122
00:07:06,719 --> 00:07:07,199
roll

123
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:08,440
And so on

124
00:07:08,839 --> 00:07:10,279
She also took the money from your bank

125
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:11,519
To please the people in the Prime Minister's House

126
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:12,760
Don't you care about that

127
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:15,880
Where is she

128
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,560
What a beautiful bride

129
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:27,599
Who are you

130
00:07:27,959 --> 00:07:29,839
Please invite the groom

131
00:07:34,399 --> 00:07:35,120
Ghost marriage

132
00:07:36,519 --> 00:07:37,560
Jiang Yaozu sold me

133
00:07:37,839 --> 00:07:39,000
Women's marriage

134
00:07:39,159 --> 00:07:40,880
The head of the family has the final say

135
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:43,639
Your brother has agreed

136
00:07:44,079 --> 00:07:44,959
I'm human

137
00:07:45,320 --> 00:07:46,199
Not animal

138
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,279
You sold a lot of money to be satisfied

139
00:07:49,839 --> 00:07:51,639
It's so beautiful

140
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,120
Unfortunately, my son

141
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:54,159
madam

142
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,480
You and I are both women

143
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:56,639
Let me go, okay

144
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,279
shut up

145
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,240
Who are you

146
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,680
It is your creation to serve my son

147
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:02,639
madam

148
00:08:02,719 --> 00:08:03,440
The auspicious time has come

149
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,000
Let me go

150
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:20,360
Worship heaven and earth

151
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:22,880
Let me go

152
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:25,920
Can you escape the fire

153
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,800
Presumably to keep you

154
00:08:27,800 --> 00:08:29,680
Take this female tortured scene for me

155
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,480
Second worship to the high hall

156
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,839
And what you deserve

157
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:37,639
Don't blame me

158
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,480
Husband and wife worship

159
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:43,720
Jiujiu

160
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,880
What's wrong with my lady

161
00:08:47,439 --> 00:08:49,039
Go prepare the carriage. I'm going out

162
00:08:51,319 --> 00:08:52,639
This late night

163
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,600
Go

164
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:57,120
Yes

165
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:08,039
What are you laughing about

166
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:10,720
My big day

167
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,679
Shouldn't I laugh

168
00:09:15,319 --> 00:09:17,559
Should I call my parents-in-law

169
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,159
Just figure it out

170
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:22,240
To be a family with you two

171
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:23,880
It's also a blessing

172
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,919
Okay, go ahead

173
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:26,960
Don't miss the hour

174
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:28,880
Enter the bridal chamber

175
00:09:29,639 --> 00:09:30,200
Let go

176
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,919
I'll do it myself

177
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:17,279
Lord

178
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:18,960
Shen Que came to Beijing this time to ask for tiger charms

179
00:10:19,319 --> 00:10:20,279
It is called guarding the border and defending the enemy

180
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,559
In fact, he is greedy for military power

181
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,120
The Third Prince and Prime Minister were very worried

182
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:27,120
It's a ghost marriage

183
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,639
Lord, don't care

184
00:10:30,919 --> 00:10:31,439
Lord

185
00:10:32,439 --> 00:10:33,679
Choi You-an

186
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:34,760
Presumptuous

187
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,200
Why do you call Choi You-an directly

188
00:10:36,799 --> 00:10:37,760
What a great smell of alcohol

189
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:38,639
You walk away

190
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:41,200
My lady's behavior is not in accordance with the rules

191
00:10:41,319 --> 00:10:41,840
Shut up

192
00:10:42,679 --> 00:10:43,679
Rules and rules

193
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,720
Just know the rules

194
00:10:45,319 --> 00:10:46,919
It's a girl

195
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,360
You can't coax me

196
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:51,600
Life is too short

197
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:54,760
Why don't you do something fun

198
00:10:55,439 --> 00:10:56,080
You're drunk

199
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,720
Choi You-an

200
00:10:58,439 --> 00:10:59,880
You look good

201
00:11:00,439 --> 00:11:02,000
You are like the moon in the sky

202
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,880
But it's good looking

203
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,799
It's just a little cold

204
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:12,880
Please respect yourself

205
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,319
Choi Woo-an, I want to tell you a secret

206
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:17,880
what

207
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,679
This is my first kiss

208
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,880
Nineteen sends her back

209
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:29,319
I'm not coming with me

210
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:30,639
I don't, no, no, go quickly

211
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:31,600
I'm not going back

212
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,159
Choi You-an

213
00:11:33,439 --> 00:11:34,639
Come on, let go of me

214
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:35,880
Choi You-an

215
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,360
Where did you get

216
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,919
Anxious to see your fucking husband

217
00:11:43,559 --> 00:11:44,519
Have you reached North Street

218
00:12:04,679 --> 00:12:06,919
Upper Bridge

219
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:13,319
Get out of the way

220
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:15,159
Who dares to stop our Li Yuanwai family's wedding sedan chair

221
00:12:30,039 --> 00:12:30,799
Are they officers and men

222
00:12:31,439 --> 00:12:32,279
Want to ask for help

223
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,039
Just shout

224
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:37,519
Who cares about a woman's life or death these days

225
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:39,319
Naturally regardless

226
00:12:40,319 --> 00:12:41,000
but

227
00:12:41,319 --> 00:12:43,919
Watch out for fire candles

228
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,559
Officers and soldiers of North Street

229
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:49,159
Right now

230
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:51,080
Someone's coming

231
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,480
Rebellion

232
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:54,240
Heaven is dead

233
00:12:54,679 --> 00:12:55,840
Li Tian Dangli

234
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:57,880
Aged in Jiazi

235
00:12:58,279 --> 00:12:59,799
The world is good luck

236
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:01,399
You're gonna die

237
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,600
What anti-poem to read

238
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,880
Want to kill us

239
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:04,799
You just shut up

240
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,159
Mother and father

241
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:08,319
Don't you miss your son so much

242
00:13:09,319 --> 00:13:11,039
I'll send you to see him

243
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:15,799
Would princes, generals and Xiangning have seeds

244
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:19,600
Open the door

245
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:20,519
Tell her to shut up

246
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:21,840
Come on, come on

247
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:26,120
Come on

248
00:13:26,799 --> 00:13:28,760
To die together

249
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,600
No one wants to live

250
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:32,639
Shut up, you bitch

251
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:35,000
Someone's coming to rebel

252
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:50,279
The anti-poem you read

253
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:51,559
Yes

254
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,360
You should know what crime is

255
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,000
According to the law of our court

256
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,240
Those with the intention of rebellion

257
00:13:57,559 --> 00:13:59,200
The whole family is killed

258
00:14:05,840 --> 00:14:06,760
You're not afraid of death

259
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:07,600
Afraid

260
00:14:10,439 --> 00:14:12,080
But even more afraid that the enemy will live

261
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:14,159
General

262
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:15,919
This woman talks crazily

263
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,519
It has nothing to do with the villain

264
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,439
The villain is willing to kill it with his hand

265
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,720
To prove innocence

266
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,840
Li Wuchang

267
00:14:25,159 --> 00:14:26,200
You don't remember Shen

268
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:28,399
Shen has been looking for you for many years

269
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,480
Three years ago, the battle of Xinma River

270
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,080
You defected and led the Hu people to sneak attack our rear

271
00:14:35,679 --> 00:14:37,319
Yumenguan was almost lost

272
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:38,319
You

273
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:39,439
You have the wrong person

274
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:41,200
The face of an enemy

275
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,639
I remember how many years ago

276
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:50,639
The officers and men killed people

277
00:14:51,319 --> 00:14:52,000
Master

278
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:52,480
Go quick

279
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:54,120
Master

280
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,360
Master

281
00:14:57,159 --> 00:14:57,799
Master

282
00:14:58,799 --> 00:14:59,840
Shen Que

283
00:15:30,760 --> 00:15:31,519
Your eyes

284
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:34,159
Much like an old friend of mine

285
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:36,000
General Wang

286
00:15:36,799 --> 00:15:39,360
Think of your old acquaintance

287
00:15:39,799 --> 00:15:41,319
Give the little girl a way to live

288
00:15:42,319 --> 00:15:43,279
You really want to live

289
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:45,159
I want to live very much

290
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,799
To live

291
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:49,399
Can you sacrifice everything

292
00:15:52,279 --> 00:15:52,960
Why

293
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:56,000
Nothing survives me

294
00:15:56,279 --> 00:15:56,919
More important

295
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:00,200
Yes

296
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:01,840
This point

297
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:04,279
It's very similar to her

298
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:05,880
The life and death of a little girl

299
00:16:06,159 --> 00:16:07,559
It's all in the general's thought

300
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:10,080
I hope the general will show mercy

301
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:15,240
You're out of luck

302
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,480
The old friend who looks like you

303
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,919
Have a grudge against me

304
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:41,120
Cui Yongzi

305
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:47,000
No arrows

306
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:48,880
General Shen

307
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:51,159
This is my passing wife

308
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:56,639
Just kidding

309
00:16:57,559 --> 00:16:58,039
Sorry

310
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,319
General Shen returned to Beijing soon

311
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:01,639
Those who don't know are not blamed

312
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,720
Advise the general to be careful in everything

313
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,319
Yes

314
00:17:09,399 --> 00:17:10,799
Shen Que Yijie Cao Mang

315
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,440
Rootless and pediceless

316
00:17:13,359 --> 00:17:14,160
Bachelor Cui

317
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,440
You are a noble man of Tianhuang

318
00:17:17,519 --> 00:17:18,240
Thank you for your suggestion

319
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:25,640
farewell

320
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,279
I'm fine. It's not my blood

321
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:39,440
I'll take you home

322
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:41,519
Good

323
00:17:45,279 --> 00:17:48,440
Young Master Cui seems to be at odds with the general

324
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,039
Have you ever heard of Zhang Chao

325
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,279
Border General Zhang Chao

326
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,920
I heard that the military exploits were great

327
00:17:57,920 --> 00:17:59,160
But murderous and tyrannical

328
00:17:59,319 --> 00:18:00,319
Slaughter the city and kill prisoners

329
00:18:01,559 --> 00:18:02,519
That's his adoptive father

330
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:04,119
Shen Qi compared to him

331
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,920
It's worse than that

332
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:10,200
What happened to Lady Jiang

333
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,400
Nothing

334
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:12,839
Choi You-an

335
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,240
Nineteen, let me go

336
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:16,559
I said I'm not going back

337
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,119
Choi Woo-an, I just kiss you

338
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,319
What are you hiding from

339
00:18:22,079 --> 00:18:22,960
That was careless

340
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,240
What accidentally

341
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:26,760
I took the initiative. What happened

342
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:28,879
You

343
00:18:29,720 --> 00:18:32,599
This is the first time I've seen Young Master Cui angry

344
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:33,960
I don't have

345
00:18:34,599 --> 00:18:36,519
I just met her at Guanyin Bridge

346
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:37,640
Found her drunk

347
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,400
I'll order Nineteen to send her back

348
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:41,879
Don't know

349
00:18:42,559 --> 00:18:43,160
Is it

350
00:18:45,839 --> 00:18:47,200
That's a coincidence
