1
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:53,601
What are you doing

2
00:00:57,041 --> 00:00:57,920
You're serious

3
00:00:59,681 --> 00:01:00,480
Otherwise

4
00:01:20,881 --> 00:01:21,640
Jiang Songyou

5
00:01:23,321 --> 00:01:24,080
I don't believe it

6
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:25,360
Get down here

7
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:26,360
I don't

8
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,321
Unless you tell the truth

9
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,280
Let me go

10
00:01:32,681 --> 00:01:33,360
I don't

11
00:01:33,801 --> 00:01:34,360
You

12
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:23,200
Sister Jiang Sister Jiang

13
00:02:24,161 --> 00:02:26,281
Thank you, sister. The fish cakes are delicious

14
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:27,800
What fish cakes

15
00:02:28,001 --> 00:02:28,881
Excuse me

16
00:02:28,881 --> 00:02:30,281
I've mistaken the person

17
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:31,360
Wait a minute

18
00:02:32,721 --> 00:02:33,721
Who gave you the fish cakes

19
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,721
Is a first glance

20
00:02:35,721 --> 00:02:37,881
An elder sister who looks a bit like Madam

21
00:02:46,001 --> 00:02:46,920
Where is she

22
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,680
I'm sorry I'm late

23
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:02,960
What are you doing

24
00:03:04,041 --> 00:03:05,161
She's my wife

25
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,881
I'm gonna take her home

26
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:09,080
When did she become your lady

27
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,161
Shen Que, you can't protect her

28
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:14,881
Let go

29
00:03:47,601 --> 00:03:48,360
All right

30
00:03:49,041 --> 00:03:50,161
I'm not gonna do anything to you

31
00:03:50,441 --> 00:03:51,960
Just to fool the old eunuch

32
00:03:53,041 --> 00:03:55,360
Can we fool

33
00:03:56,721 --> 00:03:58,721
Otherwise, I want to be clean

34
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,601
Do you really want those women to be executed

35
00:04:11,881 --> 00:04:13,001
I want to get the Tiger Charm

36
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:16,321
But you won't kill innocent people

37
00:04:19,121 --> 00:04:20,200
You just believe me

38
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,001
Right

39
00:04:23,001 --> 00:04:24,640
There are too many ghosts in this world

40
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:26,921
Doing dirty things in a glamorous skin

41
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:28,121
But you won't

42
00:04:29,361 --> 00:04:31,801
You used to be a magnanimous boy under my bright universe

43
00:04:32,361 --> 00:04:34,040
If even you are beyond recognition

44
00:04:34,441 --> 00:04:35,600
What else can I believe

45
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,801
Good

46
00:04:45,441 --> 00:04:47,001
I will never leave you untrustworthy

47
00:04:47,361 --> 00:04:48,121
I want the tiger charm

48
00:04:48,481 --> 00:04:50,080
And I'll save their lives

49
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:55,921
Shen Que

50
00:04:56,960 --> 00:04:58,160
I'm going to the Prime Minister's Mansion

51
00:04:59,040 --> 00:04:59,761
It's not easy for you

52
00:04:59,761 --> 00:05:00,921
Did you just break away from Choi Woo-an

53
00:05:01,121 --> 00:05:03,200
Didn't you ask me why I couldn't go

54
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:04,761
I also want to know

55
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,681
So I'm going to the Prime Minister's house and asking for answers

56
00:05:09,561 --> 00:05:10,481
I can do it for you

57
00:05:11,001 --> 00:05:12,040
You have your duties

58
00:05:12,481 --> 00:05:14,121
There are thousands of people who need you

59
00:05:14,801 --> 00:05:19,241
What's more, people can only rely on themselves

60
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,160
But when you go to the prime minister's house, it's a sheep into the tiger's mouth

61
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,200
Do you believe me

62
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,001
All right

63
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,361
Wait until you find an answer or need help

64
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,361
Just press here

65
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,200
He didn't hurt you

66
00:05:40,681 --> 00:05:41,441
What to pretend

67
00:05:42,241 --> 00:05:42,881
You hungry

68
00:05:43,881 --> 00:05:44,761
I had someone prepare

69
00:05:45,241 --> 00:05:45,921
Taste

70
00:05:53,001 --> 00:05:53,801
Choi You-an

71
00:05:54,921 --> 00:05:56,241
Let's make a deal

72
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:01,720
say

73
00:06:02,001 --> 00:06:03,400
I can just follow you

74
00:06:04,121 --> 00:06:04,840
But you

75
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:06,921
You want to give me Jiang Jiaojiao

76
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,720
Why do you want her

77
00:06:09,921 --> 00:06:10,720
I hate her

78
00:06:11,441 --> 00:06:12,400
I want to get back at her

79
00:06:15,001 --> 00:06:16,040
I already killed her

80
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,681
It won't

81
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,761
Jiang Jiaojiao won't die easily

82
00:06:24,561 --> 00:06:26,280
That's nice, it saves trouble

83
00:06:35,761 --> 00:06:37,001
Hate someone's eyes

84
00:06:37,441 --> 00:06:38,481
That's not the case

85
00:06:39,241 --> 00:06:40,441
No matter what you want her to do

86
00:06:40,681 --> 00:06:41,761
I will promise

87
00:06:42,761 --> 00:06:44,441
But don't play tricks with me

88
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,881
Jiang Niangzi

89
00:06:55,561 --> 00:06:56,840
You finally came back

90
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:01,561
roll

91
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,080
Have a good rest

92
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,280
We have a long way to go

93
00:07:25,121 --> 00:07:27,040
Lang Jun, are you okay

94
00:07:28,361 --> 00:07:29,241
Notice

95
00:07:29,801 --> 00:07:32,840
The day after tomorrow, I will marry Lady Jiang as my wife

96
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:34,960
Mr., you can't

97
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,640
You just married the young lady a few days ago

98
00:07:39,241 --> 00:07:42,160
There is no reason to marry another wife again

99
00:07:44,600 --> 00:07:45,960
There is no such rule

100
00:07:49,241 --> 00:07:50,640
Then I'll break it

101
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:02,801
Choi You-an

102
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,561
This is the fish cake I made for you myself. Look

103
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,761
You think you learned to do this

104
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,640
I'll look at you differently

105
00:08:18,761 --> 00:08:19,561
NO

106
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:22,200
I just think you had a hard time

107
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,361
I want to be nice to you

108
00:08:23,761 --> 00:08:25,040
Do you think I'm doing this

109
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,280
Don't know

110
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:28,840
But I'm good to you

111
00:08:29,121 --> 00:08:30,761
It's because you're a nice person

112
00:08:31,001 --> 00:08:31,921
Because you deserve it

113
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:33,361
I'm a good person

114
00:08:33,361 --> 00:08:34,600
Yes, you must be

115
00:08:36,361 --> 00:08:37,481
I figured it out

116
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,961
The cicada mother is gone

117
00:08:39,520 --> 00:08:41,001
You broke into many pieces

118
00:08:41,881 --> 00:08:44,040
I'm gonna piece you together piece by piece

119
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:45,361
Put you back together

120
00:08:45,361 --> 00:08:47,040
The Best Choi You-an in the World

121
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,241
So what can you do for me

122
00:08:49,241 --> 00:08:50,201
Anything is fine

123
00:08:51,361 --> 00:08:52,800
As long as it can make up for you

124
00:08:53,961 --> 00:08:54,721
OK

125
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,280
I'll wait to see

126
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,361
But replace it with

127
00:09:03,361 --> 00:09:05,160
Just the plot of chasing my wife's crematorium

128
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:06,961
The more I give now

129
00:09:07,601 --> 00:09:09,680
He will regret more and more later

130
00:09:13,841 --> 00:09:14,920
Jiang Jiaojiao

131
00:09:16,081 --> 00:09:18,040
How can I see you

132
00:09:22,280 --> 00:09:23,201
What are you doing? Go

133
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:24,920
What do you do? Let me go

134
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,121
Let go

135
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:28,160
Let me go, let me go, don't move

136
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:29,520
A girl who can't get on the table

137
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,920
Since you want to enter the door of the Prime Minister's Mansion

138
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:31,920
You have to learn the rules first

139
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,361
Go and strip her clothes for me

140
00:09:33,361 --> 00:09:33,680
Yes

141
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:35,241
Let go, let me go

142
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:38,680
Don't come over

143
00:09:38,841 --> 00:09:40,121
I'll kill whoever comes over

144
00:09:40,481 --> 00:09:41,920
To bluff

145
00:09:45,841 --> 00:09:47,881
I'll fuck you, you stinking girl

146
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,560
It hurts me so much

147
00:09:50,601 --> 00:09:51,680
How dare you look at me

148
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:52,440
I

149
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:53,201
stop

150
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,201
Lang Jun

151
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:04,481
Let go

152
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:05,481
Don't touch me

153
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:07,081
Nausea

154
00:10:09,201 --> 00:10:09,800
Lang Jun

155
00:10:10,201 --> 00:10:11,920
I wanted her to learn the rules

156
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,881
To wait on you

157
00:10:18,361 --> 00:10:19,160
Lang Jun

158
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:37,721
Hand

159
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,640
You're the same thing as him

160
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:50,520
Don't you be afraid

161
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:52,400
Animal

162
00:11:03,320 --> 00:11:03,961
Let's go

163
00:11:05,721 --> 00:11:06,721
Take you to someone

164
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,280
Congratulations

165
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,481
Finally found me

166
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,481
I just want an answer

167
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,961
Why can't I get out of town

168
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:33,400
Want to know

169
00:11:33,881 --> 00:11:34,680
Please

170
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:40,121
Healing the scar, forget the pain, right

171
00:11:40,121 --> 00:11:41,001
What are you doing

172
00:11:41,201 --> 00:11:43,160
The truth is not something you can bear

173
00:11:43,721 --> 00:11:44,520
say

174
00:11:45,841 --> 00:11:47,361
This is what you have to ask yourself

175
00:11:57,601 --> 00:11:58,320
Jiang Song

176
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,400
Everyone in this world

177
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,241
The future has a variety of endings

178
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:03,800
Except

179
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,361
Beyond you

180
00:12:08,361 --> 00:12:09,160
Why

181
00:12:09,601 --> 00:12:11,601
Because you never should have a future

182
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:14,721
What do you mean

183
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:21,520
Your eyes, nose, mouth

184
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:23,841
It's all my work

185
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,440
I made you

186
00:12:30,081 --> 00:12:32,040
The first snow fell on the day you were born

187
00:12:32,280 --> 00:12:34,761
Thirteen-year-old father died in exile

188
00:12:34,961 --> 00:12:37,560
I met Shen Que on the black market at the age of eighteen

189
00:12:38,001 --> 00:12:40,841
Every moment of great change in your life

190
00:12:41,001 --> 00:12:42,761
Just a few lines from my novel

191
00:12:43,081 --> 00:12:43,680
And you

192
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:46,560
Just an ancient woman who hasn't lived a chapter

193
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,560
You mean

194
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,320
This world

195
00:12:57,961 --> 00:12:59,560
Just a novel you wrote

196
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,160
I died in an accident

197
00:13:02,601 --> 00:13:04,601
Then I went through to the novel I wrote

198
00:13:05,001 --> 00:13:06,001
You're dead

199
00:13:07,121 --> 00:13:08,520
To accidents

200
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:11,320
I warned you

201
00:13:11,601 --> 00:13:13,920
You should have died in that fire

202
00:13:14,440 --> 00:13:16,201
I survived for you

203
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:17,961
Turned your life around

204
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,481
So you're dead in your world

205
00:13:20,481 --> 00:13:21,841
Come and take my life

206
00:13:22,001 --> 00:13:23,601
How can you talk like this

207
00:13:23,961 --> 00:13:26,320
Where would you have lived without me

208
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:30,640
You can't get out of town

209
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:32,201
Is because I never wrote

210
00:13:32,201 --> 00:13:33,481
Your story out of town

211
00:13:35,081 --> 00:13:36,001
To you

212
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:38,081
The outside world never existed

213
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:40,761
You mean

214
00:13:43,121 --> 00:13:44,601
My past is false

215
00:13:45,961 --> 00:13:47,241
The future I yearn for

216
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:49,800
Doesn't exist at all

217
00:13:50,081 --> 00:13:50,721
Yes

218
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,560
You are a man without a past

219
00:13:53,721 --> 00:13:56,001
Present and future people

220
00:13:57,841 --> 00:13:58,601
But I clearly

221
00:14:00,201 --> 00:14:02,121
I was so close to succeeding

222
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,440
Just a little bit

223
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,320
You lied to me

224
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,761
I'm not lying to you

225
00:14:10,841 --> 00:14:12,440
Anyone can get out of town

226
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:13,520
Only you can't

227
00:14:13,841 --> 00:14:16,081
Because I was before you were born

228
00:14:16,081 --> 00:14:18,241
I've already written your plot

229
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,241
Even if you kill me

230
00:14:20,680 --> 00:14:22,160
You can't escape, either

231
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,440
But I'm a real person

232
00:14:25,001 --> 00:14:26,201
The blood I've shed

233
00:14:26,201 --> 00:14:27,280
The tears shed

234
00:14:28,361 --> 00:14:29,721
How could it be fake

235
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:36,961
There must be a way

236
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:40,081
There's gonna be a way

237
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,640
There's got to be a way, right

238
00:14:44,481 --> 00:14:46,081
No matter what it costs me

239
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:46,920
I'm willing

240
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:49,440
Even if there is only a glimmer of hope

241
00:14:54,961 --> 00:14:56,841
There is no hope Jiang Song

242
00:14:57,841 --> 00:14:59,040
There won't be

243
00:15:11,800 --> 00:15:13,241
I don't believe it

244
00:15:46,881 --> 00:15:50,160
You poisoned me

245
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:55,841
You accept your fate, Jiang Song

246
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,841
I poisoned her as you told me

247
00:16:06,601 --> 00:16:07,961
As long as you like

248
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:09,721
I can help you keep her

249
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,601
Well done

250
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:23,841
Lady Jiang has been like this for several hours

251
00:16:24,241 --> 00:16:25,640
Didn't even blink

252
00:16:26,121 --> 00:16:27,121
The meal was never used

253
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:29,640
Forget it, let's go

254
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,680
Every moment of great change in your life

255
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:48,601
Just a few lines from my novel

256
00:16:49,081 --> 00:16:51,040
You are a man without a past

257
00:16:51,241 --> 00:16:53,721
Present and future people

258
00:17:04,560 --> 00:17:07,440
My wife is now the young lady of the prime minister

259
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:08,881
As per the rules

260
00:17:08,881 --> 00:17:11,961
Should give you a wedding dress for the back door

261
00:17:16,441 --> 00:17:18,280
Look how beautiful this wedding dress is

262
00:17:19,481 --> 00:17:20,120
I forgot

263
00:17:20,921 --> 00:17:22,001
You're going blind

264
00:17:26,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Lady Come

265
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:27,520
Let me go

266
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:28,280
Let me show you

267
00:17:28,441 --> 00:17:29,161
Let me go

268
00:17:33,681 --> 00:17:36,161
All this is just a game for me

269
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,441
I want to take back what I gave you little by little

270
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,161
That's the fun of this game

271
00:17:50,961 --> 00:17:51,520
Lord

272
00:17:51,641 --> 00:17:52,641
Jiang Song is outside the door

273
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:53,761
Said I needed your help

274
00:17:55,961 --> 00:17:57,201
It's finally here

275
00:17:57,441 --> 00:17:58,921
That subordinate let her come in now

276
00:17:59,161 --> 00:17:59,880
What's the rush

277
00:18:01,001 --> 00:18:02,080
Let her wait

278
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,161
Cui Yongzi

279
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:41,481
Is Young Master Cui still counting what he says

280
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,641
As long as I obey, as long as I beg you

281
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:45,880
You promise me anything

282
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:48,921
It depends on whether you are really obedient

283
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:50,721
I ask only one thing

284
00:18:51,320 --> 00:18:52,120
say

285
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,161
Kill Jiang Jiaojiao

286
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:08,721
very good

287
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,040
This is the look of hating someone
