1
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:52,480
Come and have a look

2
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,281
That is the adopted son of Shen Que and Zhang Chao

3
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,440
Not long ago they slaughtered a city

4
00:01:01,641 --> 00:01:02,961
Do evil, keep your voice down

5
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,041
Stay away from people like this

6
00:01:04,601 --> 00:01:05,440
He's coming over

7
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:06,400
Walk walk walk

8
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,481
Jiang Song

9
00:01:26,921 --> 00:01:27,440
Shen Que

10
00:01:28,721 --> 00:01:29,641
Why did you run out

11
00:01:34,841 --> 00:01:36,121
I asked Miaohua to take care of you

12
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:38,040
Where have you been

13
00:01:39,201 --> 00:01:40,080
I went to catch the thief

14
00:01:40,481 --> 00:01:41,281
Didn't she tell you

15
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:43,960
She told me

16
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,641
So are you waiting for me here

17
00:01:49,761 --> 00:01:50,721
So concerned about me

18
00:01:51,841 --> 00:01:52,520
No way

19
00:01:53,401 --> 00:01:55,201
Wait, don't wait outside

20
00:01:55,361 --> 00:01:56,201
How cold it is outside

21
00:01:58,001 --> 00:01:59,001
I said I

22
00:01:59,841 --> 00:02:00,721
I didn't wait for you

23
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:03,880
Okay, you didn't wait for me

24
00:02:07,761 --> 00:02:08,401
Just come back

25
00:02:18,281 --> 00:02:19,721
I found the cure. Take it now

26
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:21,561
Where did you come from

27
00:02:24,401 --> 00:02:25,440
A miracle doctor gave it to me

28
00:02:26,521 --> 00:02:27,241
Miracle doctor

29
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,440
What's wrong with you

30
00:02:35,841 --> 00:02:36,521
Shen Que

31
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:38,160
Do you know that

32
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,401
After I took the antidote

33
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,440
I'm gonna go a long, long way

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,440
A place without you

35
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,040
Even so

36
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:49,040
You still want me to take the antidote

37
00:02:53,241 --> 00:02:53,721
Right

38
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,160
Why

39
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,681
Because

40
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,961
I want you to go where you want

41
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,681
I want you to live for yourself

42
00:03:05,521 --> 00:03:06,401
You saved me

43
00:03:07,281 --> 00:03:09,600
Not because I'm a different person

44
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,081
But you're just fine

45
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:14,801
Although it is difficult for me to walk all the way

46
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:17,001
But there are more choices than you do

47
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:19,320
Now you have found your way

48
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:22,040
I can't trap you anymore

49
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,600
Jiang Song

50
00:03:25,081 --> 00:03:27,001
Don't waver for anyone

51
00:03:28,160 --> 00:03:29,200
Not even me

52
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:33,521
Good

53
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,880
I'm not as good as you say

54
00:03:50,081 --> 00:03:50,920
I'm selfish

55
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,681
Many times

56
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:55,040
I'm all about myself

57
00:03:56,401 --> 00:03:57,521
Fish eat bugs and grow up

58
00:03:58,081 --> 00:03:59,681
The tree draws water and grows taller

59
00:04:00,320 --> 00:04:01,241
But no one said

60
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,401
Trees and fish are selfish

61
00:04:04,521 --> 00:04:06,121
They just follow the physical instinct

62
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,561
You too, Jiang Song

63
00:04:11,440 --> 00:04:13,920
You actually call me a fish

64
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,160
I'm a tree

65
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,640
Because you are also one of the spirits in the world

66
00:04:21,001 --> 00:04:22,360
I have seen a lot of fish

67
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:23,321
A lot of trees

68
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,081
But I only met one Jiang Song

69
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:31,480
My eyes don't seem to hurt anymore

70
00:04:49,841 --> 00:04:50,920
Can't you still see

71
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,160
This liar

72
00:04:55,761 --> 00:04:56,401
Shen Que

73
00:05:02,881 --> 00:05:03,441
Does it hurt

74
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:06,920
No pain

75
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,281
I I fell

76
00:05:09,881 --> 00:05:10,881
I often fall

77
00:05:17,521 --> 00:05:18,160
Don't cry

78
00:05:21,081 --> 00:05:21,680
You see

79
00:05:22,721 --> 00:05:23,360
What is this

80
00:05:35,521 --> 00:05:36,201
Jiang Song

81
00:05:38,761 --> 00:05:40,040
You'll catch your moon

82
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:04,081
Come back

83
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:07,321
I didn't think we all survived

84
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,920
Thanks to General Shen's rescue

85
00:06:10,600 --> 00:06:12,000
I used to think General Shen

86
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:12,961
Is a great villain

87
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,240
And thanks to Lady Jiang for taking us in

88
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:17,680
You may as well

89
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,641
My mother took my brother back to the country

90
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:23,120
This house is empty as well

91
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,160
a form of address for one's wife

92
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,680
Why don't you just come to

93
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,000
General Shen's place to stay

94
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,560
It's tattered here

95
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,081
There is no reason to keep bothering others

96
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,480
Ma'am, look

97
00:06:44,761 --> 00:06:46,000
I found your piggy bank

98
00:06:56,521 --> 00:06:57,240
What's wrong

99
00:06:59,321 --> 00:07:00,961
What are you listening to?

100
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:06,321
Isn't there any sound

101
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,281
No, no

102
00:07:10,641 --> 00:07:12,360
There are so many people at home now

103
00:07:13,040 --> 00:07:15,240
Filling your stomach is a big problem

104
00:07:18,721 --> 00:07:20,680
Touch left and touch right

105
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,721
Touch up, touch down

106
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,641
Money is rolling in

107
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,881
Come on, madam

108
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:30,321
You just pulp out of this piggy bank

109
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:31,560
So this money

110
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,000
It won't appear out of thin air

111
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,120
Also

112
00:07:36,401 --> 00:07:38,961
Still filling your stomach is the most important thing

113
00:07:40,081 --> 00:07:40,521
Right?

114
00:07:41,321 --> 00:07:41,761
Let's go

115
00:07:42,201 --> 00:07:42,560
Good

116
00:08:24,441 --> 00:08:25,040
Who

117
00:08:25,721 --> 00:08:26,920
Three and a half catties of cucumber and cabbage

118
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:29,920
Sesame opens the door and smiles

119
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,560
Come back

120
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,560
Qianqian

121
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:40,841
Your family keeps letting you read

122
00:08:41,041 --> 00:08:42,161
They must love you very much

123
00:08:42,561 --> 00:08:43,561
Why don't you go home

124
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,000
Since childhood, I have been determined

125
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,681
To govern the world and serve the country like a man

126
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:48,801
I want to wait until

127
00:08:48,801 --> 00:08:50,681
The day when a woman can also enter the court as an official

128
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:54,360
But now I can't get my family into trouble

129
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:56,760
Will there come a day

130
00:08:57,441 --> 00:08:58,441
I'm gonna work for it

131
00:08:59,041 --> 00:09:00,120
Third Prince Zhao Yong

132
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:01,760
Is the person most likely to become the new emperor

133
00:09:02,161 --> 00:09:03,081
If I see him

134
00:09:03,081 --> 00:09:04,600
I will surely express my heart to him

135
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,600
No matter what the result is then

136
00:09:07,041 --> 00:09:08,041
At least I tried

137
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,400
I'm back

138
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,640
We made ten dollars today

139
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,480
So many

140
00:09:15,480 --> 00:09:16,721
Isn't this too amazing

141
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:18,120
I'm exhausted

142
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:18,681
a form of address for one's wife

143
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,841
I heard a strange thing on my way today

144
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:22,480
What is it?

145
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:25,400
Zhenren asked Your Majesty to appoint a new Princess of Changning

146
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,480
Princess Changning

147
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:27,921
What's strange is that princess

148
00:09:27,921 --> 00:09:31,400
Say what can bless your majesty's health

149
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,801
The goddess came into the world

150
00:09:32,801 --> 00:09:33,480
Vulcan comes into the world

151
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,441
One step at a time, one fire lotus

152
00:09:34,681 --> 00:09:35,561
Nezha?

153
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,400
Madam, do you have an idea

154
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,081
Embroidery and painting are really valuable

155
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:45,240
But that's not enough

156
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:46,880
What about the expenses of so many of us

157
00:09:50,961 --> 00:09:51,760
a form of address for one's wife

158
00:09:52,600 --> 00:09:54,841
Why does General Shen come

159
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,321
You're avoiding him

160
00:09:59,561 --> 00:10:01,801
Lady Jiang, will you stay for the general

161
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,321
He's been alone all these years

162
00:10:04,841 --> 00:10:05,801
It's so lonely

163
00:10:13,520 --> 00:10:14,721
Don't you say hello

164
00:10:18,801 --> 00:10:19,441
Don't go

165
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,280
Why avoid me

166
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,760
Am I doing something wrong

167
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,600
I'm sorry, Brother Pi

168
00:10:30,161 --> 00:10:32,600
These days only get out but not get in

169
00:10:33,961 --> 00:10:35,120
Makes you hungry

170
00:10:49,441 --> 00:10:50,081
a form of address for one's wife

171
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,561
Money really appears out of thin air

172
00:10:53,081 --> 00:10:54,120
A miracle happened

173
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:57,400
fool

174
00:10:58,760 --> 00:10:59,801
Where's the miracle?

175
00:11:14,081 --> 00:11:15,280
I had a dream

176
00:11:16,441 --> 00:11:18,640
Dream of a night when I was eighteen years old

177
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,120
My uncle forced me to marry again

178
00:11:41,801 --> 00:11:42,801
I don't want to marry

179
00:11:44,441 --> 00:11:45,400
But my mother said

180
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,081
I'm too selfish and willful

181
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:51,880
Is it really my fault

182
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,480
I just want to marry someone I like

183
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,640
If only someone could get me out of here

184
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:07,480
I

185
00:12:08,681 --> 00:12:09,360
You what

186
00:12:15,561 --> 00:12:16,961
I have nothing

187
00:12:23,280 --> 00:12:23,841
Yeah

188
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:25,921
You don't have anything

189
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:28,360
The man who married me

190
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:30,681
It must be a majestic general

191
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:32,400
Gotta be a hero

192
00:12:32,841 --> 00:12:33,801
To be worthy of me

193
00:12:45,801 --> 00:12:47,321
This is the moment

194
00:12:47,961 --> 00:12:50,561
Moments that made me regret for many years

195
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,400
If I had stopped him and told him

196
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,120
It doesn't matter if you have nothing

197
00:12:58,120 --> 00:12:59,880
If I were not so willful

198
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:01,880
Let go of childish pride

199
00:13:02,721 --> 00:13:04,321
If I say that

200
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,000
Everything

201
00:13:07,280 --> 00:13:08,801
Will it be different

202
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,240
Shen Que

203
00:13:24,161 --> 00:13:26,240
This time in a dream

204
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,961
I finally said that

205
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,480
I'm willing to go with you

206
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:35,480
I dreamed we watched it together

207
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:37,081
One thousand and one sunrises

208
00:13:37,841 --> 00:13:39,600
Counted a hundred thousand stars

209
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:41,640
Raised two children

210
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:44,520
One like you and the other like me

211
00:13:44,961 --> 00:13:47,041
Like any ordinary couple

212
00:13:47,921 --> 00:13:49,520
The days are sweet and bitter

213
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:52,600
Get old as you walk

214
00:13:53,801 --> 00:13:54,681
Shen Que

215
00:13:55,081 --> 00:13:57,880
I dreamed of our long life

216
00:14:07,921 --> 00:14:08,721
Shen Que

217
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,201
I miss you so much

218
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,360
Lady, where are you going

219
00:14:22,681 --> 00:14:23,921
I'm going to see Shen Che

220
00:14:24,081 --> 00:14:24,841
Now

221
00:14:25,201 --> 00:14:26,400
Right now

222
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:31,520
Shen Que

223
00:14:32,321 --> 00:14:34,640
My first thought when I woke up was

224
00:14:35,161 --> 00:14:38,120
Fortunately, fortunately, we still had time

225
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:42,000
It's my turn to see you this time

226
00:15:02,921 --> 00:15:03,721
Shen Que

227
00:15:07,161 --> 00:15:07,880
Jiang Song

228
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:12,201
Shen Que

229
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,161
Shen Que

230
00:15:15,081 --> 00:15:15,760
Jiang Niangzi

231
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:17,161
You calm down

232
00:15:17,161 --> 00:15:17,760
Shen Que

233
00:15:18,681 --> 00:15:19,801
Shen sure I am willing

234
00:15:21,161 --> 00:15:22,760
Shen Que, I'm here to tell you

235
00:15:23,161 --> 00:15:24,681
I'd like to stay for you

236
00:15:24,961 --> 00:15:26,721
Lady Jiang, please calm down

237
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:29,921
Shen Que

238
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:33,681
Shen Que

239
00:15:33,961 --> 00:15:34,841
You calm down

240
00:15:34,841 --> 00:15:36,360
You let go, you calm down

241
00:15:36,561 --> 00:15:37,520
Shen Que

242
00:15:38,561 --> 00:15:40,400
What happened, Amo

243
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:04,961
Third Highness, Lord

244
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,280
There's no one inside

245
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,961
Shen must have hidden them

246
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:14,640
Cousin

247
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:16,561
Mother can tell me

248
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,360
Sinful women must die

249
00:16:18,841 --> 00:16:19,640
Sadhana's prophecy

250
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,400
There is a guilty woman who will bring back the Cloud Chung Order

251
00:16:23,081 --> 00:16:25,120
That thing can help the first prince reverse the verdict

252
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,360
If that's the case

253
00:16:26,721 --> 00:16:28,880
Not to mention that the remaining party of the prince will support Zhao Chengze

254
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,801
When the prince was convicted

255
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,520
That's what my mother and I did

256
00:16:37,201 --> 00:16:37,961
The general confessed

257
00:16:38,561 --> 00:16:39,201
If something happens to him

258
00:16:39,201 --> 00:16:40,280
To take you out of Jiang's house

259
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:40,921
be careful

260
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,161
Wait for the limelight to pass before going back to Jiang's house

261
00:16:42,400 --> 00:16:43,520
It's the most dangerous and safest place

262
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,120
Good

263
00:16:45,681 --> 00:16:46,201
Who

264
00:17:06,841 --> 00:17:07,681
Jiang Jiaojiao

265
00:17:07,841 --> 00:17:10,360
No, I'm a storyteller

266
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:12,721
How could you

267
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:14,641
Don't you want to hear the story first

268
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,240
What story

269
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,121
I saved

270
00:17:23,401 --> 00:17:24,921
The Story of Five Fish

271
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,161
Don't delay

272
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,401
Choi You-an will be here in a moment

273
00:17:30,721 --> 00:17:31,560
Come with me

274
00:17:36,881 --> 00:17:38,520
You just believe Shen Que

275
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:40,121
If he tells you where you are

276
00:17:40,121 --> 00:17:40,760
He won't

277
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:42,000
Won't

278
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,280
It's just love

279
00:17:45,601 --> 00:17:47,280
Even you have risen to her

280
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:50,601
Why don't we make a bet

281
00:17:51,441 --> 00:17:54,520
Let's bet that Shen will betray you
