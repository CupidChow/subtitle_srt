Food is like a time machine

39
00:01:24,459 --> 00:01:27,212
that allows you to step back into your past feelings.

40
00:01:28,213 --> 00:01:31,089
It’s incredible how the scent of the dish
can transport you back

41
00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:32,967
to your childhood in an instant.

42
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:35,929
What I never told you

43
00:01:36,012 --> 00:01:38,430
is that your dishes brought me back
to the time in my childhood

44
00:01:38,431 --> 00:01:39,474
that I tried to bury.

45
00:01:40,809 --> 00:01:43,353
But I didn’t want to look back at it
because it’s too painful.

46
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,648
That’s why I could never tell you about it.

47
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:49,108
But being with you,

49
00:01:51,027 --> 00:01:53,029
showed me that I had to face the past.

50
00:01:53,905 --> 00:01:56,866
The past is an ingredient
that makes me the person I am today.

And then...

373
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:42,155
Look.

374
00:29:42,197 --> 00:29:43,281
Like this.

375
00:29:45,909 --> 00:29:46,659
See?

376
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,328
Can you do that?

377
00:29:48,536 --> 00:29:49,954
Okay. You do it.

378
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,089
There you go! Very good.

Where’s his mom?

380
00:30:06,596 --> 00:30:08,931
She’s upstairs, resting.

381
00:30:08,932 --> 00:30:10,725
She’s not well.

382
00:30:12,894 --> 00:30:14,854
But I have a bad feeling about this.

383
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:20,568
I’ve seen cuts on her wrists.

384
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:26,824
What if it was just an accident?

385
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,035
Huh, on her wrists?

386
00:31:20,003 --> 00:31:20,712
Mom?

387
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:27,927
Mom.

388
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:29,554
Mom?

389
00:31:31,139 --> 00:31:32,515
[In Tagalog]
Move! Give way!

390
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:34,892
[In Korean]
Mom?

391
00:31:40,315 --> 00:31:41,316
Ha-Joon...

392
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,650
Ha-Joon.

393
00:31:42,650 --> 00:31:43,610
[In Korean]
Mom!

394
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,819
Ha-Joon...

395
00:31:46,821 --> 00:31:48,196
Mom!

396
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:49,532
Ha-Joon.

397
00:31:50,992 --> 00:31:53,411
Mom!

398
00:32:00,293 --> 00:32:01,711
Mom!

399
00:32:03,046 --> 00:32:04,380
Mom!

400
00:32:17,185 --> 00:32:20,271
I'm supposed to meet Maya today
for a cooking class.

401
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:23,066
I need to tell her I’m going back to Korea.

402
00:32:25,318 --> 00:32:30,365
Sir, can you please bring him
to his friend’s house first?

403
00:32:31,699 --> 00:32:32,700
No, I cannot.

404
00:32:32,825 --> 00:32:33,785
We will miss our flight.

405
00:32:33,786 --> 00:32:35,328
For 5 minutes only, Sir.

406
00:32:36,204 --> 00:32:39,582
The chairman gave specific instructions
to take him straight to the airport.

407
00:32:39,666 --> 00:32:41,042
It won’t take long.

408
00:32:41,250 --> 00:32:42,251
I said no.

409
00:33:05,608 --> 00:33:06,943
You promise...

410
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,569
be a good boy.

411
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:10,488
Okay.

412
00:33:10,988 --> 00:33:11,739
Let’s go.

413
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,468
Malaya!

414
00:33:33,219 --> 00:33:34,429
Malaya!

415
00:33:35,388 --> 00:33:36,848
Ha-Joon!

416
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,559
Mr. Ramon!

417
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:42,645
Nanny Mels!

418
00:33:42,729 --> 00:33:44,272
Ha-Joon!

419
00:33:45,940 --> 00:33:47,358
Mr. Ramon!

420
00:33:48,609 --> 00:33:50,403
Nanny Mels!

421
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:53,281
They’re gone, Maya.

422
00:34:01,122 --> 00:34:04,083
But he said we’re going
to the cooking class today.

423
00:34:04,292 --> 00:34:07,128
He knows that it's my dream.

424
00:34:09,213 --> 00:34:10,798
Liar!

425
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:32,195
Flight KR 456 is now boarding.
Passengers for Flight 456 is now boarding.

426
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,326
Hello?

427
00:35:21,911 --> 00:35:22,620
Maya...

428
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,832
you need to take this.

429
00:36:02,785 --> 00:36:04,995
Today’s agenda is about

430
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,080
voting the new chairman of LB Group.

431
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:10,918
How can we entrust our future to a person
who acts so recklessly

432
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,754
and without any sense of responsibility?

433
00:36:15,006 --> 00:36:16,631
I made my mistakes.

434
00:36:16,632 --> 00:36:19,092
I would rather that you remember me
for the rules I broke

435
00:36:19,093 --> 00:36:20,720
and not for your heart that I broke.

436
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,388
Hi, Maya.

437
00:36:22,389 --> 00:36:23,514
It’s me again.

438
00:36:24,223 --> 00:36:25,349
Please call me back.
