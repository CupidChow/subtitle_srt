1
00:00:04,921 --> 00:00:06,672
I’ve decided to create a challenge

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:09,133
for whoever wants to move up
and take the spot.

3
00:00:09,134 --> 00:00:11,969
It’s the last chance I have to pay off my debt.

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:12,846
Whose dish is it?

5
00:00:12,846 --> 00:00:13,471
Mine, Chef.

6
00:00:13,472 --> 00:00:14,472
It’s a little under seasoned.

7
00:00:14,473 --> 00:00:16,182
Our dish was a hundred times better.

8
00:00:16,599 --> 00:00:17,225
What's going on?

9
00:00:17,226 --> 00:00:18,392
It’s a bit off.

10
00:00:18,393 --> 00:00:19,144
A bit off?

11
00:00:19,144 --> 00:00:19,728
Maya!

12
00:00:19,729 --> 00:00:20,978
Can you prepare your shrimp quiche?

13
00:00:20,979 --> 00:00:22,105
Yes, Chef, I can do it!

14
00:00:28,778 --> 00:00:29,529
Honey?

15
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:36,453
Oh, f♪ck.

16
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:45,879
What can I possibly say to earn your forgiveness?

17
00:00:46,796 --> 00:00:48,798
I wish there was a recipe to follow,

18
00:00:49,549 --> 00:00:51,468
a guaranteed list of things to do,

19
00:00:51,968 --> 00:00:53,428
like heat the oil,

20
00:00:53,845 --> 00:00:55,180
mince the garlic.

21
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:00,185
If only it were that easy.

22
00:01:03,855 --> 00:01:05,856
If only I could whisk away my mistakes

23
00:01:05,857 --> 00:01:08,359
and smoothen everthing between us.

24
00:01:11,863 --> 00:01:13,865
But people are more complex than that.

25
00:01:14,365 --> 00:01:16,493
Once there’s a crack in a relationship,

26
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:19,037
something invisible is broken,

27
00:01:19,662 --> 00:01:20,830
there’s no undoing it.

28
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,626
I made my mistakes.

29
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:26,795
No matter how good my reasons were,

30
00:01:27,921 --> 00:01:28,963
I messed up.

31
00:01:29,839 --> 00:01:31,132
Like in service,

32
00:01:31,966 --> 00:01:33,301
there’s no going back.

33
00:01:34,219 --> 00:01:36,262
There’s only going forward.

34
00:01:37,096 --> 00:01:39,307
And I will work for your forgiveness

35
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,434
from this day forward.

36
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,268
I trusted you!

37
00:02:23,935 --> 00:02:25,311
And this is how you repay me?

38
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,605
I'm sorry, Chef.

39
00:02:29,399 --> 00:02:31,609
How the hell can we come back from this?

40
00:02:34,279 --> 00:02:36,030
Who is responsible for peeling the shrimp?

41
00:02:36,865 --> 00:02:38,032
Of course.

42
00:02:38,533 --> 00:02:40,743
I never liked you from the day you showed up
in my kitchen.

43
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,954
Why on earth are you even here?

44
00:02:43,621 --> 00:02:44,622
You know what you are?

45
00:02:45,248 --> 00:02:47,375
You are like a rotten vegetable in my kitchen.

46
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,669
Completely worthless!

47
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:52,839
[speaking in Korean]
Why on earth are you even here?

48
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:55,925
Living here doesn't make you our family.

49
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,594
You're just the mistress' child.

50
00:03:08,062 --> 00:03:09,397
Can’t you do anything right?

51
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,900
Won’t you take a hint and leave?

52
00:03:12,191 --> 00:03:12,859
Fine.

53
00:03:13,443 --> 00:03:14,861
- I...
- It's my fault.

54
00:03:15,695 --> 00:03:17,655
I take full responsibility.

55
00:03:19,782 --> 00:03:20,992
- Maya...
- Shut up!

56
00:03:22,785 --> 00:03:26,080
You always remind us
that the chef takes full responsibility of the team.

57
00:03:26,247 --> 00:03:27,957
I am responsible for him.

58
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,418
If I don’t take responsibility for this now,

59
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:32,754
then I'm not qualified to be a chef.

60
00:03:38,384 --> 00:03:39,844
You both can leave now.

61
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,139
I’ll discuss the next step with management.

62
00:03:43,598 --> 00:03:44,140
Go!

63
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,582
Maya...

64
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,084
I don’t want to talk about it.

65
00:04:19,801 --> 00:04:22,720
- Maya, I'm really sorry.
- I said I don't want to talk about it.

66
00:04:47,495 --> 00:04:50,872
It’s past your work hours,
why are you just getting in?

67
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:51,833
You’re here.

68
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:52,792
Are you working two jobs?

69
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:57,463
I had the worst day. I'm exhausted.

70
00:04:57,672 --> 00:04:58,214
Hey.

71
00:04:59,465 --> 00:05:00,967
You’re the one who told me.

72
00:05:01,676 --> 00:05:04,429
You wanted a place where no one can find you

73
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:09,726
where you’d be just doing physical job.

74
00:05:11,269 --> 00:05:13,187
Yeah, fine.

75
00:05:13,730 --> 00:05:14,981
But what brings you here?

76
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:22,322
Want some too?

77
00:05:25,116 --> 00:05:27,744
Seeing that you showed up without calling...

78
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:31,330
There’s an emergency there too?

79
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:34,459
Well, there’s always an emergency.

80
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,545
Everyone seems to be going nuts looking for you.

81
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:41,882
I can't tell you how many calls and texts I’ve had.

82
00:05:41,883 --> 00:05:43,509
They’re asking if I really don’t know where you are.

83
00:05:45,428 --> 00:05:50,474
They are looking for you, they want you to sign a document
excluding yourself from the will.

84
00:05:50,475 --> 00:05:52,143
Those assholes.

85
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:56,773
But the chairman wants you to be his successor.

86
00:05:56,981 --> 00:06:00,902
Do you think your half siblings
will just stand there and watch?

87
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:04,071
You know who they are better than anyone else.

88
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:06,991
Tell dad to change the will.

89
00:06:09,577 --> 00:06:10,703
If you come with me.

90
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:13,081
What?

91
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:14,791
If you come with me!

92
00:06:15,083 --> 00:06:16,708
If you meet him in person,

93
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,877
then he’ll change the will.

94
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,881
Of course...

95
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:26,344
Why does he always have to make it so difficult for me?

96
00:06:27,011 --> 00:06:28,553
Just listen to him.

97
00:06:28,554 --> 00:06:29,847
I don’t want!

98
00:06:34,143 --> 00:06:35,353
Where are you going?

99
00:06:36,145 --> 00:06:38,481
Well now that I know you’re alive,
I should get going.,

100
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,441
I booked a room at your hotel.

101
00:06:41,192 --> 00:06:44,737
You’re not expecting me to spend the night
at this dump, right?

102
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,449
No, this is a business trip.

103
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:50,076
Business?

104
00:06:50,451 --> 00:06:51,619
What business?

105
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:56,165
There’s a huge cooking competition
in Jakarta this month.

106
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,043
The main sponsor is our company.

107
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:00,962
Aren’t you informed?

108
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:05,216
Anyway, I’m meeting with your boss to discuss something.

109
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:07,927
Arif? My boss?

110
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,473
Well, good luck.

111
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:25,862
I do think it’s yours, not theirs.

112
00:07:30,324 --> 00:07:32,493
Why would you give it up so easily?

113
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,624
Why wouldn’t you fight for what’s rightfully yours?

114
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:12,283
Please Chef, just...

115
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:14,160
give me one more chance.

116
00:08:14,952 --> 00:08:16,412
After last night’s debacle,

117
00:08:17,872 --> 00:08:19,248
I don’t think so.

118
00:08:19,540 --> 00:08:21,292
I’m very disappointed, Maya.

119
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:23,752
I’m really sorry, Chef.

120
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:26,422
But let me make it up to you.
Just hear me out.

121
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,007
I want to make a dish for the Davis’

122
00:08:29,008 --> 00:08:30,968
using a kepel fruit.

123
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:33,386
Kepel fruit?

124
00:08:33,387 --> 00:08:34,096
Yes, Chef.

125
00:08:34,096 --> 00:08:34,889
You’ve got to be kidding me.

126
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,432
That’s an impossible fruit to find.

127
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:37,934
You know why?

128
00:08:38,809 --> 00:08:39,769
No, Chef.

129
00:08:40,603 --> 00:08:42,271
Because it’s not available on the market.

130
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,065
Try to look around the markets in Jakarta.

131
00:08:45,066 --> 00:08:46,776
See if you can find even an inkling of it.

132
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:54,450
Please, Chef. Just...

133
00:08:54,659 --> 00:08:55,785
one more day.

134
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,370
Just one day.

135
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:01,082
One day.

136
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,209
You have only one day.

137
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:05,628
Okay. Thank you, Chef.

138
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:06,629
Thank you!

139
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:19,433
Maya!

140
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,144
[speaking in Tagalog]
We need to talk to you.

141
00:09:23,813 --> 00:09:26,231
What are you doing here?
I thought you had class today.

142
00:09:26,232 --> 00:09:28,316
We’re here for Rodolfo.

143
00:09:28,317 --> 00:09:30,278
He’s been trying to get in touch with you.

144
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:32,904
I’ve been meaning to pay,

145
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:35,408
but my aunt needed some help.

146
00:09:35,491 --> 00:09:36,742
You’ve been late on your payments.

147
00:09:36,951 --> 00:09:39,161
He says he’s going to raise the interest.

148
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:40,496
By how much?

149
00:09:40,496 --> 00:09:41,330
Double.

150
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:42,456
Double?

151
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:44,833
16,000 pesos a month?

152
00:09:44,834 --> 00:09:46,751
Where am I going to get such an amount?

153
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:48,545
You need to take care of that, Maya.

154
00:09:48,546 --> 00:09:50,256
Who knows what he’s capable of.

155
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,383
You have to pay it soon

156
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,219
or your aunt in Manila could be in real trouble.

157
00:10:05,146 --> 00:10:06,355
Maya, are you all right?

158
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,650
I’m fine. What are you doing here?

159
00:10:09,859 --> 00:10:11,152
I heard you talking to Arif.

160
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:13,653
I just want to help you search for the kepel fruit.

161
00:10:13,654 --> 00:10:14,697
I’m planning to go alone.

162
00:10:15,031 --> 00:10:16,865
- Maya, please let me help you.
- Jack...

163
00:10:16,866 --> 00:10:18,868
What part of “No” don’t you understand?

164
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:21,328
I just want to help.

165
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:22,997
It was my mistake to begin with.

166
00:10:25,958 --> 00:10:27,084
Please.

167
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,047
I want to go alone.

168
00:10:32,673 --> 00:10:33,799
Okay?

169
00:10:36,844 --> 00:10:37,803
Oppa!

170
00:10:38,971 --> 00:10:40,139
What a coincidence?

171
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,639
When did you arrive?

172
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:42,767
What brings you here?

173
00:10:43,517 --> 00:10:44,560
Are you here for business?

174
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,981
But... who is this?

175
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,442
Uhm...

176
00:10:51,817 --> 00:10:53,277
This is Maya.

177
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:55,154
Hi.

178
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,281
Oh, she works for you!

179
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:00,326
I see...

180
00:11:04,872 --> 00:11:07,374
Don’t let me interrupt you.
You guys seem busy...

181
00:11:07,375 --> 00:11:09,335
I’ve got things to do.

182
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,212
Nice to meet you.

183
00:11:14,882 --> 00:11:17,551
Everyone in Seoul is looking for you.

184
00:11:18,094 --> 00:11:20,804
Uhm... I just got here, for work.

185
00:11:20,805 --> 00:11:22,056
I’ll be flying out soon.

186
00:11:22,306 --> 00:11:23,057
- Really?
- Yes.

187
00:11:23,057 --> 00:11:23,724
To where?

188
00:11:23,933 --> 00:11:25,267
When is your flight?

189
00:11:25,684 --> 00:11:28,479
You have time to eat with me
before going, right?

190
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:32,232
We’ll see, okay?

191
00:11:32,233 --> 00:11:33,192
I really have to go now.

192
00:11:33,859 --> 00:11:34,777
- Bye!
- Oppa!

193
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:43,744
Hey, it’s me.

194
00:11:44,203 --> 00:11:45,663
I just met Chaerin.

195
00:11:46,914 --> 00:11:49,125
She won’t stay quiet. She might tell the family.

196
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:51,001
Can you help me out?

197
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:09,395
Excuse me.

198
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:12,148
Kepel fruit?

199
00:12:13,691 --> 00:12:14,316
Kepel.

200
00:12:15,568 --> 00:12:16,610
Okay, thank you.

201
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:24,952
Excuse me...

202
00:12:25,161 --> 00:12:27,455
Uhm, kepel fruit?

203
00:12:27,705 --> 00:12:28,497
Kepel?

204
00:12:28,789 --> 00:12:30,081
[speaks in Bahasa]
We don't have that.

205
00:12:30,082 --> 00:12:32,542
But get some rambutan and mangosteen,

206
00:12:32,543 --> 00:12:34,753
they're much tastier!

207
00:12:37,381 --> 00:12:41,510
Planting a kepel tree brings a curse.

208
00:12:44,013 --> 00:12:44,930
What?

209
00:12:45,306 --> 00:12:46,973
It's a devil's tree.

210
00:12:46,974 --> 00:12:49,018
That's why it's so rare.

211
00:12:49,393 --> 00:12:51,979
You won't find it here.

212
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:55,483
That doesn’t sound good.

213
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:00,111
I said I didn’t need any help.

214
00:13:00,112 --> 00:13:01,822
I’m just here enjoying satay (barbecued meat).

215
00:13:03,407 --> 00:13:04,450
So have you found it?

216
00:13:05,993 --> 00:13:07,411
Not yet.

217
00:13:09,121 --> 00:13:09,955
Here, have this.

218
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,916
You need your energy.

219
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,473
No?

220
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,225
Thank you.

221
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,861
I really think we should go to the next town.

222
00:13:41,862 --> 00:13:43,280
I don’t think we’ll find it here.

223
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,574
All right.

224
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:55,251
Thank you.

225
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:56,460
[speaks in Bahasa] Thank you.

226
00:13:57,628 --> 00:13:58,254
Thank you.

227
00:14:03,717 --> 00:14:04,426
Thank you.

228
00:14:21,235 --> 00:14:22,695
- You like it?
- Yes.

229
00:14:23,821 --> 00:14:25,573
It’s similar to something that...

230
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:27,408
we have back home.

231
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,284
It’s called “turon” [fried banana rolls].

232
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:30,327
- Turon.
- Turon.

233
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,916
It's as if I’m with my mom again.

234
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,932
- Good?
- Yes, it’s good.

235
00:14:53,642 --> 00:14:54,768
It’s called “turon”

236
00:14:59,189 --> 00:14:59,982
Oh...

237
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:02,276
Thank you.

238
00:15:05,029 --> 00:15:07,322
- I think we should get going.
- Yeah. Uhm, okay.

239
00:15:07,323 --> 00:15:08,741
We only have a few hours left.

240
00:15:09,074 --> 00:15:09,783
Let’s go.

241
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,994
Give that to us! [speaking in Bahasa]

242
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:13,787
No!

243
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,291
Hey!

244
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:22,463
Are you all right?

245
00:15:23,922 --> 00:15:25,715
Hey, are you all right?

You good?

247
00:15:35,476 --> 00:15:36,310
Do you want some ice cream?

248
00:15:39,938 --> 00:15:41,649
Taste good? Yeah?

249
00:15:45,444 --> 00:15:46,362
No luck?

250
00:15:48,364 --> 00:15:50,324
The vendors say we can’t find it here.

251
00:15:51,325 --> 00:15:53,994
All right, so what should we do?

252
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,165
I don't know.

253
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:00,958
I don't even know what I was thinking,

254
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:03,087
even Arif himself couldn’t find it.

255
00:16:04,421 --> 00:16:06,340
[speaks in Bahasa]
What are you looking for?

256
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,217
Uhm...

257
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:13,681
We’re... looking for...

258
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,184
the kepel fruit.

259
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:20,354
Kepel... Kepel fruit?

260
00:16:22,815 --> 00:16:24,066
Kepel fruit?

261
00:16:25,275 --> 00:16:26,193
No?

262
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:31,532
Kepel... Kepel fruit.

263
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:34,618
- Kepel, kepel...
- Oh... this.

264
00:16:34,702 --> 00:16:36,787
I saw it at my neighbor’s house.

265
00:16:36,912 --> 00:16:38,747
There’s lots of it!

266
00:16:49,466 --> 00:16:50,926
Where are you taking us, kiddo?

267
00:16:59,059 --> 00:17:00,227
There it is!

268
00:17:02,479 --> 00:17:03,814
Monster!

269
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,693
How can we get to it if the dog is guarding it?

270

How can we get to it if the dog is guarding it?

271
00:17:08,944 --> 00:17:10,195
I’ll take care of this.

00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:11,947
What are you going to do?

273
00:17:16,994 --> 00:17:18,494
You know... I’ve got this.

274
00:17:18,495 --> 00:17:19,329
I was in the army.

275
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,497
Yeah.

276
00:17:24,001 --> 00:17:25,586
Okay, well... be careful!

00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:31,800
I can do this.

I can do this.

But seriously! What are you doing here?

00:18:41,328 --> 00:18:45,249
Working as a trainee chef in Jakarta, of all places.

298
00:18:45,707 --> 00:18:47,501
Okay. I know, it seems strange,

00:18:47,835 --> 00:18:49,753
I heard the stories, they talk about me.

00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,047
Like what a Korean man like me is doing
in the kitchen.

- Peeling shrimp, terribly!
- Yeah.

302
00:18:54,716 --> 00:18:55,592
It’s just...

303
00:18:58,345 --> 00:19:00,137
I have some issues back in Korea

304
00:19:00,138 --> 00:19:04,518
and I thought leaving there
would help me clear my thoughts.

305
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:05,727
Alright, then.

306
00:19:06,436 --> 00:19:07,520
What’s your story?

307
00:19:07,521 --> 00:19:10,732
How did you end up moving
from the Philippines to Indonesia?

308
00:19:12,568 --> 00:19:13,902
I...

309
00:19:14,403 --> 00:19:16,113
I had heard about Arif

310
00:19:16,363 --> 00:19:18,365
and his reputation as a chef.

311
00:19:18,782 --> 00:19:21,826
So when I heard that he was having an opening
in his kitchen,

312
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:23,787
of course, I jumped at the chance.

313
00:19:24,705 --> 00:19:25,914
And...

314
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:29,084
Yeah, I guess I could be doing other jobs...

315
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:32,170
working in another countries,
earning more money.

316
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:38,302
But this job, it pays slightly
more than what I was earning in Manila.

317
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,219
Okay.

318
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:41,763
And I was excited to learn from a famous chef and...

319
00:19:42,890 --> 00:19:44,766
A few years later, I...

320
00:19:45,183 --> 00:19:46,351
I don’t regret it.

321
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:48,270
At least for the most part.

322
00:19:50,814 --> 00:19:52,232
For the most part?

she was sick for a while,
and I was all that she had.

326
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:05,495
So...

327
00:20:06,413 --> 00:20:07,914
I just have to work extra hard,

328
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:09,291
so that I can pay it all back.

329
00:20:14,546 --> 00:20:16,965
We should get going, it’s getting dark.

330
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:18,926
Yeah.

331
00:20:49,081 --> 00:20:50,207
[speaking in Korean]
Hello, Chaerin.

332
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:51,500
Oh my God!

333
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:53,669
How did you know I was here?

334
00:20:54,294 --> 00:20:57,422
I saw Ha-Joon today too.

335
00:20:57,714 --> 00:20:59,257
Yes, I heard.

336
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,969
Did you also hear we're having dinner later?

337
00:21:02,552 --> 00:21:07,516
Unfortunately, but he told me to tell you

338
00:21:07,641 --> 00:21:09,059
that he can't make it.

339
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,604
But, by any chance...

340
00:21:13,146 --> 00:21:15,399
Did you mention

341
00:21:15,774 --> 00:21:19,486
to the press or anyone
that you saw President Gu here?

342
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,028
Don’t worry!

343
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:22,823
I’m very discreet.

344
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:25,826
I only told his family.

345
00:21:26,535 --> 00:21:28,870

00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:30,706
Okay!

349
00:21:44,845 --> 00:21:47,973
It’s almost finished, I’ll let you taste it later.

350
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,684
What's this?

351
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,894
A cooking competition?

352
00:21:53,437 --> 00:21:55,604
Don’t mind that.
Jack gave it to me earlier.

353
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:57,149
He said it would be good for me to join.

354
00:21:57,274 --> 00:21:58,984
The prize is huge,

355
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:01,695
think of what you could do with the money, May.

356
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:03,030
That’s what I’m thinking too.

357
00:22:03,447 --> 00:22:06,116
But the entry fee, it’s pricey for me.

358
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,952
What if you talk to Arif about it?

359
00:22:09,161 --> 00:22:12,706
I probably should, since I’d need his permission
if I’m going to join that competition.

360
00:22:12,873 --> 00:22:13,956
No, what I mean is...

361
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,709
If you represent the restaurant, maybe...

362
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:19,463
maybe they can sponsor your entry fee.

363
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,592
I hope so.

364
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:25,010
I’ll try.

365
00:22:26,303 --> 00:22:28,221
This could open doors for you.

366
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:31,058
$35,000.

367
00:22:39,691 --> 00:22:40,733
This is kepel?

368
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,736
Yes, Chef. I made a chutney out of it.

369
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,077
Interesting.

370
00:22:50,994 --> 00:22:52,079
Not bad.

371
00:22:52,788 --> 00:22:54,748
Execution could have been better,
but this is not bad.

372
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:56,249
Okay, Chef.

373
00:22:56,708 --> 00:22:57,834
So what’s the pairing?

374
00:22:58,960 --> 00:23:01,880
I was thinking nasi goreng [Indonesian fried rice], Chef.

375
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:03,465
Nasi goreng, that’s a bit...

376
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:04,883
ordinary.

377
00:23:07,761 --> 00:23:11,263
Well Chef, I wanted to prioritize organically

378
00:23:11,264 --> 00:23:13,265
and locally produced ingredients.

379
00:23:13,266 --> 00:23:17,020
I think it’s good for the kitchen,
and the flavors are even better.

380
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:18,771
I guarantee you, Chef,

381
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,525
this is the perfect dish for our guests.

382
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:25,570
I’ll bet my job on it.

383
00:23:27,280 --> 00:23:28,532
Are you sure?

384
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,247
I’d hate to lose you.

385
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,556
Chef, this is amazing!

386
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:54,849
How on earth did you know
I’ve been craving for this?

387
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:57,351
This dish was prepared as a gesture of goodwill,

388
00:23:57,352 --> 00:23:59,812
so I'm glad that it suits your taste.

389
00:23:59,813 --> 00:24:02,524
Uhm, how did you think of pairing this with kepel?

390
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:04,191
I hope you don't find it rude,

391
00:24:04,192 --> 00:24:06,694
but I learned that Madam has a weak stomach.

392
00:24:06,695 --> 00:24:09,488
And kepel fruit is rich in vitamin C,

393
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:11,491
which can help reduce inflammation.

394
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:12,617
Oh.

395
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:15,871
Chef Hadi, how wonderful!

396
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,040
I'm at a loss for words.

397
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:23,211
Always at your pleasure.

398
00:24:23,920 --> 00:24:25,422
Thank you, thank you.

399
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,516
And uhm, our trainee cook Jack,

400
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,852
will clear up the plates when you’re done.

401
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,770
- Please enjoy the food.
- Thank you.

402
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:42,272
Thank you.

403
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:59,539
It went supremely well.

404
00:25:00,207 --> 00:25:01,791
I did good, wouldn’t you say?

405
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:03,251
Yes, Chef.

406
00:25:08,048 --> 00:25:10,466
Chef, while I have you,

407
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:14,220
I wanted to talk to you
about the culinary competition coming up.

408
00:25:14,221 --> 00:25:15,639
What about it?

409
00:25:15,764 --> 00:25:17,307
I’d wanted to join.

410
00:25:17,807 --> 00:25:20,477
Do you think the hotel
will sponsor my entrance fee?

411
00:25:21,269 --> 00:25:24,606
Well, I have to warn you
that the standards are very high.

412
00:25:26,149 --> 00:25:28,860
And I don’t want you to be disappointed.

413
00:25:30,278 --> 00:25:32,280
I don't understand.

414
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:38,370
Maya, you are not ready to compete at that level.

415
00:25:39,079 --> 00:25:41,039
There’s still a lot to learn.

416
00:25:56,137 --> 00:25:58,889
Who the hell is he to tell you
that you can’t compete?!

417
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:00,308
Especially after today.

418
00:26:00,934 --> 00:26:02,977
You did all the research on Mrs. Davis.

419
00:26:02,978 --> 00:26:04,436
You thought of the dish.

420
00:26:04,437 --> 00:26:05,604
That was all you, Maya!

421
00:26:05,605 --> 00:26:07,232
None of that matters, Jack.

422
00:26:07,399 --> 00:26:08,857
We made up for our mistake.

423
00:26:08,858 --> 00:26:10,234
And besides, he’s right,

424
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:11,903
I have so much to learn.

425
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,031
Arif stole everything from you.

426
00:26:15,657 --> 00:26:19,034
- He's a selfish bastard. That’s what he is.
- Yeah, he’s got a point, Maya.

427
00:26:19,035 --> 00:26:20,245
Guys, can you stop?

428
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:22,872
I willingly gave him that information.

429
00:26:22,998 --> 00:26:26,000
Arif never acknowledged your hard work.

430
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:27,919
He took all the glory and ran away with it!

431
00:26:28,211 --> 00:26:29,629
Why are you being so naive?

432
00:26:30,588 --> 00:26:32,424
Because I’m a team player, Jack.

433
00:26:32,716 --> 00:26:35,635
They accepted our apology
and we impressed them again.

434
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,178
Everybody wins!

435
00:26:38,179 --> 00:26:39,014
We need to talk to him.

436
00:26:39,015 --> 00:26:40,890
What do you mean “talk to him”?

437
00:26:42,642 --> 00:26:43,393
Just listen.

438
00:26:43,394 --> 00:26:45,019
- I might lose my job, Stella!
- Maya...

439
00:26:45,020 --> 00:26:46,021
- I have to go!
- Maya...

440
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:47,563
Jack!

441
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:49,107
Jack, please wait!

442
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:54,696
Sir, the Korean regional office
wants us to find this person.

443
00:26:55,697 --> 00:26:56,739
I know him.

444
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,283
He’s part of the kitchen staff.

445
00:26:58,575 --> 00:27:00,076
Call security immediately.

446
00:27:04,414 --> 00:27:04,998
It’s good.

447
00:27:05,498 --> 00:27:06,875
- Thank you, Chef.
- Arif,

448
00:27:07,083 --> 00:27:08,710
I’d like to discuss a few things with you.

449
00:27:09,753 --> 00:27:11,504
Why is a trainee talking to me directly?

450
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:12,921
Jack, if you have an issue,

451
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,131
you need to take it up
with your immediate supervi...

452
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:14,716
Chef,

453
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,885
there a few issues...

454
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,928
I’d like to directly talk to you about.

455
00:27:19,054 --> 00:27:21,181
I’m the Executive Chef.

456
00:27:21,639 --> 00:27:23,183
You are at the bottom of this kitchen.

457
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:24,893
How dare you talk to me like that?

458
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:26,101
I don’t have time for this.

459
00:27:26,102 --> 00:27:27,062
Why is this still working here?

460
00:27:27,063 --> 00:27:28,063
I’ll talk to him, Chef.

461
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,230
- Jack, come on.
- Jack?

462
00:27:29,356 --> 00:27:30,648
- You know better than this.
- Jack!

463
00:27:31,191 --> 00:27:31,649
Jack...

464
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,777
Chef, I’m sorry. This is a misunderstanding.

465
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:36,029
- Those are Maya’s ideas you stole.
- Jack, it’s okay.

466
00:27:38,531 --> 00:27:40,909
It was her dish that impressed the Davis’ today

467
00:27:41,242 --> 00:27:42,910
and if it weren’t for my mistake,

468
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,829
everyone would have been raving about the shrimp.

469
00:27:45,288 --> 00:27:46,456
I stole?

470
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:49,292
You don’t know how things work here.

471
00:27:50,627 --> 00:27:51,753
Who do you think you are?

472
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:55,006
Huh?

473
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,218
Who do you think you are?!

474
00:28:02,138 --> 00:28:03,973
[speaking in Korean]
Where on earth is he?

475
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,493
Sir, we’ve been instructed to find him.

476
00:28:27,497 --> 00:28:28,665
It’s you?

477
00:28:29,207 --> 00:28:30,667
Why are they looking for you?

478
00:28:35,088 --> 00:28:36,339
Oh, sh♪t.

479
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,333
I do need to take some action,

480
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:16,254
just so I could get myself out of this financial hole.

481
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,713
[Speaking in Tagalog]
Take a look at this.

482
00:29:17,714 --> 00:29:20,757
The prize money is $35,000.

483
00:29:20,758 --> 00:29:22,886
But I can’t afford the entry fee.

484
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:25,596
We could sell food to the hotel employees.

485
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:26,389
With this amount,

486
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,599
we should be able to cover her entry fee.

487
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:30,101
I think you’ve got a real shot at this.

488
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,562
You’re one of the most talented chefs that I ever know.

489
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:35,022
I have been hearing rumors

490
00:29:35,023 --> 00:29:38,192
that some of your kitchen staff
are going against company policies.

491
00:29:38,193 --> 00:29:42,197
This kind of thing could tarnish your reputation.

492
00:29:42,363 --> 00:29:44,781
They say someone is selling food

493
00:29:44,782 --> 00:29:46,284
to hotel employees.

494
00:29:48,786 --> 00:29:50,163
Help me find out who it is.

495
00:29:50,788 --> 00:29:51,664
Please let me know.

496
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:52,373
Immediately.
