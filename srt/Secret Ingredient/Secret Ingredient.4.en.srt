00:00:04,754 --> 00:00:07,047
[In Tagalog]
Rodolfo came to my aunt’s house.

2
00:00:07,048 --> 00:00:08,757
It’ll solve your problems.

3
00:00:08,758 --> 00:00:10,676
But I can’t afford the entry fee.

4
00:00:10,677 --> 00:00:13,054
We think we can raise enough money
to pay for the entry fee.

5
00:00:13,304 --> 00:00:15,097
Have you heard about the rumors going around?

6
00:00:15,098 --> 00:00:17,976
Someone is selling food to hotel employees.

7
00:00:18,852 --> 00:00:20,228
If you hear anything,

8
00:00:20,437 --> 00:00:21,437
please let me know.

9
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:22,313
Do you find it amusing

10
00:00:22,314 --> 00:00:24,314
haggling over someone's life
with that sort of money?

11
00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:25,899
[In Tagalog]
What’s the problem with that wh♪re?

12
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,610
You are the wh♪re.

13
00:00:28,403 --> 00:00:30,946
If, by any chance, I find you near Maya,

14
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:33,073
her aunt or anyone that she cares about,

15
00:00:33,074 --> 00:00:34,533
I will come back to this place.

16
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,493
Do you understand?

17
00:00:35,494 --> 00:00:37,161
- I’m sorry, I’m late.
- Oh my God! Where were you?

18
00:00:37,162 --> 00:00:38,620
We’ve been waiting for you the whole day.

19
00:00:38,621 --> 00:00:39,788
I had to deal with something.

20
00:00:39,789 --> 00:00:40,832
I see myself in you.

21
00:00:40,999 --> 00:00:41,791
Thank you, Chef.

22
00:00:41,792 --> 00:00:44,794
You follow every instruction brilliantly,

23
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:47,213
that’s why I’ve decided
to give you the promotion.

24
00:00:48,047 --> 00:00:48,840
Thank you.

25
00:00:53,303 --> 00:00:54,511
We found them, Arif.

26
00:00:54,512 --> 00:00:55,722
We found our crooks!

27
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,773
My mom used to tell me that in life

28
00:01:05,774 --> 00:01:06,941
and in the kitchen,

29
00:01:07,275 --> 00:01:09,194
everything is a matter of timing.

30
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:12,781
That if she met my father at a different time,

31
00:01:13,072 --> 00:01:14,699
everything would be different.

32
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,826
Is it all in timing?

33
00:01:17,744 --> 00:01:19,829
Is that the secret ingredient?

34
00:01:21,456 --> 00:01:22,874
I keep asking myself,

35
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:24,542
what’s the secret sauce,

36
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:27,337
the hidden element that makes something click?

37
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,507
What makes certain couples fail

38
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:31,925
and others last?

39
00:01:33,092 --> 00:01:37,555
What makes one person decide another
is worthy of forgiveness?

40
00:01:39,891 --> 00:01:42,352
I keep wondering if I missed my chance with you.

41
00:01:43,311 --> 00:01:44,562
Is it too late?

42
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:47,899
I pray,

43
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:50,902
there’s still hope for us to be something more.

44
00:02:34,863 --> 00:02:36,573
How dare you do this to us?!

45
00:02:37,574 --> 00:02:38,408
You again?

46
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:39,993
You’re a disgrace to the kitchen!

47
00:02:41,411 --> 00:02:44,037
- Chef, we never...
- Who's the real culprit here?

48
00:02:44,038 --> 00:02:45,039
- It's me!
- It's me!

49
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,294
I convinced Maya.

50
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,920
She said she would never do it until the end, but...

51
00:02:51,921 --> 00:02:53,089
No, I made the food.

52
00:02:53,882 --> 00:02:55,508
I am responsible for this.

53
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,302
Of all people,

54
00:02:58,261 --> 00:03:00,013
how dare you do this to us?

55
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:04,058
I'm sorry, Chef.

56
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,686
Maya,

57
00:03:06,811 --> 00:03:09,022
you have the higher position,

58
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:12,650
this is ultimately on you.

59
00:03:14,402 --> 00:03:15,737
[In Korean]
This is unbelievable!

60
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:18,740
Maya is not to blame for this.

61
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:20,116
As you said,

62
00:03:20,408 --> 00:03:22,201
I'm a disgrace to this kitchen.

63
00:03:22,952 --> 00:03:24,746
Let me make this easy for you.

64
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:26,664
I quit.

65
00:03:38,843 --> 00:03:39,969
Maya,

66
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,390
liars don’t belong in the kitchen.

67
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,927
This is for you.

68
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:26,391
I believe in you, Maya.

69
00:05:01,426 --> 00:05:02,593
Now,

70
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:06,472
you go and win that competition.

71
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:09,058
We will all be here watching you.

72
00:05:20,778 --> 00:05:22,238
Thank you.

73
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:25,491
Thanks.

74
00:05:37,462 --> 00:05:38,713
I'm sorry...

75
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,130
It’s just...

76
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:26,886
It’s been overwhelming.

77
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,597
I just got...

78
00:06:30,098 --> 00:06:31,766
promoted and then

79
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,101
fired within the same day.

80
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,186
And...

81
00:06:36,604 --> 00:06:40,108
And I don’t know why but I feel so relieved.

82
00:06:43,945 --> 00:06:45,780
You've been through a lot.

83
00:06:46,364 --> 00:06:47,656
Why don’t you go and get some rest?

84
00:06:47,657 --> 00:06:48,366
No.

85
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:50,243
I want to start over.

86
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,871
I’m going to join the competition.

87
00:06:54,872 --> 00:06:57,166
I want to see how far I can go.

88
00:08:27,632 --> 00:08:28,924
- Oh, hi!
- Hey!

89
00:08:28,925 --> 00:08:29,634
Maya!

90
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:34,347
Hi.

91
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:35,097
Hey.

92
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:37,725
What are you guys cooking?

93
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,353
Just making soup.

94
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:42,021
But...

95
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:43,689
What happened there?

96
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:44,774
What happened to your hand?

97
00:08:45,441 --> 00:08:46,859
He’s had that since yesterday.

98
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:49,361
It was so crazy, I didn’t notice.

99
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,487
Oh this?

100
00:08:50,488 --> 00:08:51,822
It was just an accident.

101
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:53,114
Don’t worry about this, it’s nothing.

102
00:08:53,115 --> 00:08:53,866
It looks so bad!

103
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,243
- Do we have the kit here?
- Yeah.

104
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,410
Let me see.

105
00:08:56,411 --> 00:08:58,412
- Did you do this to yourself?
- Ouch! Uhm...

106
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,831
- Is it okay if I...
- Yeah, go. Sure.

107
00:09:01,123 --> 00:09:02,833
- I’ll do it again. Okay?
- Okay. Ouch.

108
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:06,921
We have to clean this one.

109
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,802
By the way, where were you yesterday?

110
00:09:13,803 --> 00:09:14,929
You weren’t at the kitchen.

111
00:09:16,347 --> 00:09:17,473
Like at all.

112
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:20,101
I was helping a friend with an errand.

113
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,143
What friend?

114
00:09:21,352 --> 00:09:22,186
Have we met him?

115
00:09:22,187 --> 00:09:23,854
I feel like there’s so much we don’t know about you.

116
00:09:25,648 --> 00:09:27,857
He was just an old childhood friend.

117
00:09:27,858 --> 00:09:28,985
What’s his name?

118
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,028
- His name?
- Yes.

119
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:35,616
His name is...

120
00:09:38,869 --> 00:09:40,162
Roy.

121
00:09:40,663 --> 00:09:42,205
- Roy?
- His name is Roy. Yeah.

122
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,332
- Roy.
- Uhm, yeah.

123
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:46,376
I was helping out with his furniture,

124
00:09:46,377 --> 00:09:48,045
like I had moved his furniture.

125
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:50,339
Okay.

126
00:09:52,383 --> 00:09:53,259
Is that my phone?

127
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,135
Can you get it?

128
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:55,219
Oh, May.

129
00:09:58,431 --> 00:09:59,265

00:10:03,728 --> 00:10:06,147
for qualifying for in the International Cooking Competition!”

133
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,981
- I got in?
- Yes!

134
00:10:07,982 --> 00:10:08,858
Look.

135

Maya, congratulations! Oh my gosh!

- Maya!
- Oh my God...

137
00:10:14,405 --> 00:10:15,656
You did it!

138
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,495
[In Korean]
They won’t waste any time.

139
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,538
Even before your dad passes away,

140
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:25,207
they’ll do whatever it takes
to have control of the company.

141
00:10:25,416 --> 00:10:27,960
Aren’t the board of directors all on dad’s side?

142
00:10:28,002 --> 00:10:30,086
Yes but with the Chairman’s fragile state,

143
00:10:30,087 --> 00:10:31,005
they’re feeling anxious.

144
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,506
They still believe that you are the best person

145
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:34,717
to take over the company.

146
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:36,135
But we’re running out of time.

147
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:37,636
The sooner you return, the better.

148
00:10:37,845 --> 00:10:39,055
I will.

149
00:10:39,388 --> 00:10:40,847
But I need to stay for the cooking competition.

150
00:10:40,848 --> 00:10:42,892
It might be too late by then.

151
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:44,977
What’s holding you back?

152
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:48,606
I haven’t told her yet.

don’t they mean anything to you?

00:11:03,162 --> 00:11:04,622
Okay, I’ll leave as soon as I can.

00:11:04,955 --> 00:11:06,499
Okay. Oh! And...

159
00:11:06,749 --> 00:11:08,376
make sure to avoid any cameras.

is where you are.

Thank you.

- Maya.
- Chef.

171
00:11:56,799 --> 00:12:00,136
I see you still chose to compete against my advice.

172
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:04,682
I hope you abide by the rules this time.

173
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,142
Well, Chef, she didn’t really have a choice.

174
00:12:07,143 --> 00:12:08,435
Her aunt could have died.

175
00:12:08,436 --> 00:12:09,395
It’s that right?

176
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,985
Oh Maya, I’m so sorry to hear that.

177
00:12:16,694 --> 00:12:18,362
I could have helped if I had known.

178
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:23,993
Regardless of what happened,

179
00:12:24,326 --> 00:12:26,286
I still think you have a lot of potential

180
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,913
and I hope you do well here.

181
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:29,457
Thank you.

182
00:12:41,135 --> 00:12:42,635
- What's going on?
- We have a problem.

Maya's knives are missing.

00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:45,472
What?! What do you mean they’re missing?

185

I don't know what happened.

186

They said they delivered it to this station,

187
00:12:48,058 --> 00:12:50,561
but now they’re asking her
to use spare knives instead.

188
00:12:51,729 --> 00:12:53,021
Knives are a chef’s weapon.

189
00:12:53,022 --> 00:12:55,107
We don’t even know what prop knives they are giving her.

190
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,319
Oh, right!

191
00:12:58,611 --> 00:13:00,278
I have an extra set of knives.

192
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,947
- From the chefs. Remember?
- Yeah.

193
00:13:02,281 --> 00:13:03,532
It’s in our apartment.

194
00:13:04,116 --> 00:13:05,034
I’ll go get it!

195
00:13:05,201 --> 00:13:06,035
- You can?
- Yeah.

196
00:13:06,202 --> 00:13:06,994
Give me your keys.

197
00:13:06,994 --> 00:13:07,953
In your bag.

198
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:10,581
Here.

199
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:11,749
Okay. Please, take care.

200
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:12,500
Go.

201
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:13,626
Take care.

202
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,923
Hey, hey. Can I get a ride?

203
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:20,965
No, no, no. I’m off duty.

204
00:13:20,966 --> 00:13:22,426
- No, no, no.
- Okay, uhm...

205
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:24,010
Let me borrow the cab,

206
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,179
it’s only a few blocks.

207
00:13:25,262 --> 00:13:27,723
This should cover the gas and a little extra.

208
00:13:28,349 --> 00:13:29,475
You can stay on your call.

209
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:30,601
- Okay.
- Yeah?

210
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:33,896
Get in there. Alright.

211
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:40,527
Welcome to the international cooking competition,

212
00:13:40,528 --> 00:13:42,570
where the best of the best will compete!

213
00:13:42,571 --> 00:13:44,822
Only four teams from each region

214
00:13:44,823 --> 00:13:46,783
will be moving on to the second round.

215
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:50,078
From there, they will compete for a spot for the finale,

216
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:55,208
and they will have the chance
to get the grand prize of $35,000

217
00:13:55,209 --> 00:13:57,795
and become this year’s grand champion!

218
00:14:13,727 --> 00:14:15,019
In this round,

219
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:18,898
each team will cut and prep the ingredients
within the limited amount of time.

220
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,483
The team to finish first...

221
00:14:20,484 --> 00:14:21,235
wins!

222
00:14:21,485 --> 00:14:22,778
And your time starts...

223
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:23,612
now!

224
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:26,115
Maya.

225
00:14:26,865 --> 00:14:27,491
Maya?

226
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:30,703
Maya!

227
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:32,413
Maya, go! Go!

228
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:33,830
As you can see,

229
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:37,626
this first round will test the knife skills
and abilities of our chefs.

230
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:41,671
Who will be able to butcher their meats
and fillet their fish the fastest?

231
00:14:41,672 --> 00:14:43,090
Only time will tell!

232
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:51,348
What’s wrong, Maya?

233
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:56,436
This knife is so dull!

234
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:57,563
It’s okay.

235
00:15:01,275 --> 00:15:02,985
You can do it. Almost done.

236
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,197
Done!

237
00:15:10,367 --> 00:15:13,871
Despite some knife issues, Chef Maya is done!

238
00:15:14,413 --> 00:15:15,122
Chef.

239
00:15:22,504 --> 00:15:24,840
And that’s an official “Go” from Chef Arif!

240
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,053
He’s given the go signal for the red team
to proceed with the next prep.

241
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,139
Chef Maya’s sous chef is now prepping the chicken.

242
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:33,766
[In Tagalog]
Come on, Stella! We're almost caught up.

243
00:15:34,516 --> 00:15:36,143
Just a little faster... we're almost caught up.

244
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,729
Time seems to be speeding up,

245
00:15:39,730 --> 00:15:41,731
and the other chefs seem to be catching up

246
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:43,817
as they start to prep on the chicken.

247
00:15:47,655 --> 00:15:48,322
Done!

248
00:15:48,447 --> 00:15:50,073
And in record time,

249
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,867
the red team is done!

250
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,495
- Oh!
- Stella!

251
00:15:55,329 --> 00:15:56,121
Stella.

252
00:15:57,581 --> 00:15:58,374
Stella.

253
00:16:07,883 --> 00:16:09,051
No.

254
00:16:10,469 --> 00:16:13,346
- Chef Arif just gave a thumbs down to the red team.
- Don’t worry about me. Go to the ingredients.

255
00:16:13,347 --> 00:16:15,556
- Chef Maya’s sous chef has cut herself.
- How about you?

256
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:17,558
They need to start all over again,

257
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:19,769
as the chicken has been contaminated with blood.

258
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:20,479
Maya...

259
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:24,692
Handicapped without a partner
and limited time on the clock,

260
00:16:25,567 --> 00:16:28,611
Chef Maya needs to continue prepping
on the other ingredients

261
00:16:28,612 --> 00:16:31,365
plus start all over again with the chicken.

262
00:16:52,428 --> 00:16:54,054
Those knives are useless.

263
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,180
With her partner gone,

264
00:16:56,181 --> 00:16:57,808
she’ll never make it on time.

265
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:23,792
Maya!

266
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:25,127
Maya!

267
00:17:26,253 --> 00:17:27,337
Thank you!

268
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,179
What’s happening here?

269
00:17:35,721 --> 00:17:38,766
Like a superhero with a renewed set of powers,

270
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,393
we see Chef Maya in super speed!

271
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:02,206
All the chefs are now on overdrive.

272
00:18:03,624 --> 00:18:06,167
Chef Maya is already on her last prep!

273
00:18:06,168 --> 00:18:07,503
Unbelievable!

274
00:18:08,712 --> 00:18:10,547
With mere minutes remaining,

275
00:18:10,631 --> 00:18:12,966
can the chefs finish on time?

276
00:18:15,010 --> 00:18:16,845
Last two minutes!

277
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:25,353
Chef Maya seems to be speeding by.

278
00:18:25,354 --> 00:18:27,481
And she’s already plating!

279
00:18:34,863 --> 00:18:35,781
Done!

280
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,118
Time is up!

281
00:18:40,369 --> 00:18:42,411
Now is the moment of truth.

282
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:45,290
Chef Arif walks over for inspection.

283
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:54,800
We see the look of approval
from famed Chef Arif Hadi.

284
00:19:01,348 --> 00:19:04,852
We have determined the team advancing
in the second round.

285
00:19:05,310 --> 00:19:06,728
In first place,

286
00:19:06,854 --> 00:19:11,274
with an overwhelming score of 98 points for speed,

287
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:13,401
97 points for precision,

288
00:19:13,402 --> 00:19:15,945
and 98 points for presentation,

289
00:19:15,946 --> 00:19:17,739
is contestant number...

290
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:26,123
410, Chef Maya Laurel!

291
00:19:43,098 --> 00:19:44,016
Stella.

292
00:19:44,017 --> 00:19:46,267
Maya, congratulations!

293
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:47,394
Congratulations to both of us.

294
00:19:48,103 --> 00:19:49,228
Anyway, how are you?

295
00:19:49,229 --> 00:19:50,564
Don’t worry, it’s just a few stitches.

296
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,816
How long does it take to recover?

297
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,694
Maybe a few days.

298
00:19:58,989 --> 00:20:00,032
Then...

299
00:20:00,073 --> 00:20:01,909
what about the second round tomorrow?

300
00:20:04,119 --> 00:20:05,954
They require you a sous chef

301
00:20:09,791 --> 00:20:11,627
or else you can’t compete.

302
00:20:15,172 --> 00:20:16,465
I’m sorry.

303
00:20:35,442 --> 00:20:37,361
Maya, I hope you don’t drop out.

304
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,197
You ranked first today.

305
00:20:40,322 --> 00:20:41,865
What am I supposed to do?

306
00:20:42,532 --> 00:20:45,034
I mean, do you think anybody
in the kitchen would be available

307
00:20:45,035 --> 00:20:46,495
at such short notice?

308
00:20:46,703 --> 00:20:48,330
Probably, none.

309
00:20:49,289 --> 00:20:52,250
But you’ve worked so hard and come this far.

310
00:20:53,877 --> 00:20:55,253
I don’t know.

311
00:20:56,463 --> 00:20:58,840
It feels like the odds are against me.

312
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:03,512
They won’t even let me compete without a sous chef.

313
00:21:09,226 --> 00:21:10,185
What about you?

314
00:21:10,602 --> 00:21:13,480
Do you ever wish
you could have done things differently?

315
00:21:14,815 --> 00:21:16,607
[In Korean]
Mom, I’ll always protect you.

316
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,110
You know I will.

317
00:21:19,069 --> 00:21:20,445
I know,

318
00:21:21,071 --> 00:21:22,739
my son.

319
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,457
I won’t let you fight this alone.

320
00:21:34,543 --> 00:21:36,753
I will be your sous chef.

321
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:58,442
[In Korean]
You need to comeback right now.

322
00:21:59,192 --> 00:22:01,695
The chairman is in the hospital as you know.

323
00:22:02,738 --> 00:22:03,988
It’s only a matter of time.

324
00:22:03,989 --> 00:22:06,324
And you’ve been gone for months!

325
00:22:06,533 --> 00:22:09,327
How can you take charge when you’re not here?

326
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:12,956
I promised Maya I’d help her in the next round.

327
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:14,708
I’ll leave immediately after.

328
00:22:14,916 --> 00:22:16,460
If you don’t show up,

329
00:22:17,002 --> 00:22:19,378
the entire board will most likely vote for your brother.

330
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:21,298
That would render your father’s shares powerless.

331
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,467
If that happens,

332
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:26,178
you’ll be left with nothing.

333
00:22:43,528 --> 00:22:44,404
Maya?

334
00:22:44,821 --> 00:22:46,114
Maya Laurel!

335
00:22:46,656 --> 00:22:48,491
Enzo, what a surprise!

336
00:22:48,492 --> 00:22:50,284
- You’re a chef now?
- Hm-hmm.

337
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:53,621
Last time I saw you,
you were studying to be an engineer.

338
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:55,332
Yeah, but I gave that up.

339
00:22:55,582 --> 00:22:57,124
Switched to culinary instead.

340
00:22:57,125 --> 00:23:00,211
Let’s be honest, I’m good at engineering and cooking,

341
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:02,005
but this is more fun.

342
00:23:02,672 --> 00:23:03,465
Okay.

343
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:04,883
Looks like we’re competing against each other today.

344
00:23:05,175 --> 00:23:06,175
Isn’t that funny?

345
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:09,261
We dated back then and now we’re competing.

346
00:23:09,262 --> 00:23:13,974
You were my friend’s older bro.
We never dated.

347
00:23:13,975 --> 00:23:15,351
It’s all good!

348
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:17,020
You never returned my calls.

349
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:21,649
But I hear you traded up for a rich Korean guy.

350
00:23:21,650 --> 00:23:22,526
Huh?

351
00:23:22,734 --> 00:23:24,652
My sister says you have a boyfriend now.

352
00:23:24,653 --> 00:23:25,820
I have no idea what you're talking about.

353
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:27,988
Heard you met him here in Jakarta and...

354
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:29,866
he paid all of your mom’s debts.

355
00:23:30,283 --> 00:23:30,992
What?

356
00:23:31,159 --> 00:23:33,203
She says he’s a big shot.

357
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,915
He owns that global company LB.

358
00:23:37,541 --> 00:23:38,250
Ah!

359
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,793
I’m sure that’s how you got in.

360
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:42,254
He paid for you, right?

361
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,715
Oh, is that Chef Arif?

362
00:23:46,716 --> 00:23:48,092
Let me ask for a selfie.

363
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:49,302
I’ll go ahead.

364
00:24:06,069 --> 00:24:07,279
[In Tagalog] Auntie.

365
00:24:08,155 --> 00:24:09,238
I’m fine.

366
00:24:09,239 --> 00:24:12,074
Yes, the competition will start in a few minutes.

367
00:24:12,075 --> 00:24:14,619
I just wanted to ask you,

368
00:24:15,871 --> 00:24:19,124
about my mom’s debts.

369
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:38,727
Hey.

370
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:40,270
Are you alright?

371
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:42,898
Want to get ready?

372
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:01,415
Welcome, ladies and gentlemen!

373
00:25:01,416 --> 00:25:05,879
Round 2 of the competition
is all about the "Jewels of Southeast Asia.”

374
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:13,177
Our chefs here are tasked with creating dishes

375
00:25:13,178 --> 00:25:16,556
that will best represent Southeast Asian culture!

376
00:25:18,934 --> 00:25:20,643
Time starts...

377
00:25:20,644 --> 00:25:21,144
now!

378
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,357
And the contestants are off!

379
00:25:25,690 --> 00:25:29,861
Each of them grabbing their ingredient
and bringing it back to the chef’s table.

380
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,696
Chef Maya Laurel, who made a stunning comeback

381
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:35,032
from yesterday’s knife skill challenge,

382
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,827
seems to be making a dessert from the Philippines.

383
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:42,373
The banana leaves burn quickly.

384
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:43,333
Keep your eyes on them.

385
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:44,584
Yes, Chef.

386
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,511
Am I doing alright?

387
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:55,720
Yeah, keep going.

388
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:08,900
Each of the contestants are creating dishes
originating from Southeast Asia.

389
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,610
Now, Chef Enzo from the white team

390
00:26:11,611 --> 00:26:14,072
is predicted to be the frontrunner in this race.

391
00:26:17,075 --> 00:26:17,993
Are you sure you’re doing alright?

392
00:26:18,326 --> 00:26:20,912
I’m doing good.
Just check the pan, please.

393
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,080
Yes, Chef.

394
00:26:32,549 --> 00:26:33,550
[In Korean] Mom!

395
00:26:37,095 --> 00:26:38,305
Mom!

396
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,269
Mom! Mom!

397
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:53,194
What’s happening here?

398
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:54,821
Where is he going?

399
00:26:54,904 --> 00:26:58,658
Chef Maya is alone once again to compete on her own.

400
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:28,104
Congratulations, Chef Enzo and Chef Mae
for winning today’s challenge!

401
00:27:28,772 --> 00:27:29,731
Maya!

402
00:27:37,030 --> 00:27:37,781
Maya!

403
00:27:37,906 --> 00:27:40,825
Maya, please stop for one second! Please!

404
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:43,870
Where did you go?

405
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:46,289
Why did you leave me out there on my own?

406
00:27:46,748 --> 00:27:47,374
I’m sorry...

407
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:49,667
”I’m sorry”... Of course you’re sorry!

408
00:27:50,835 --> 00:27:53,588
Stop apologizing and just tell me the truth.

409
00:27:55,256 --> 00:27:56,549
How about this...

410
00:27:58,301 --> 00:28:00,136
Did you go to the Philippines recently?

411
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:03,681
Is that why you were missing the other day?

412
00:28:09,813 --> 00:28:12,065
- I just wanted to help.
- You wanted to help?

413
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:13,775
You lied to me!

414
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,985
Is this whole thing a lie?

415
00:28:16,903 --> 00:28:18,196
- No!
- No?!

416
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,866
And you own the LB Group?

417
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,870
What’s all of this, a publicity stunt?

418
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:28,289
Who are you?

419
00:28:31,292 --> 00:28:32,961
Maya, please...

420
00:28:33,169 --> 00:28:34,587
just please listen to me.

421
00:28:36,756 --> 00:28:40,134
I didn't have the courage to tell you the truth before.

422
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,219
Courage?

423
00:28:44,097 --> 00:28:45,598
Why do you need courage?

424
00:28:48,309 --> 00:28:50,603
The truth is just the truth.

425
00:28:53,565 --> 00:28:55,066
You’re a liar, Jack.

426
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,194
I don’t want to see you ever again.

427
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,404
Maya...

428
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:01,823
Maya, my name is not Jack!

429
00:29:04,993 --> 00:29:06,286
It’s Ha-Joon.

430
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,124
That’s the god honest truth.

431
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:05,512
Maya,

432
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:09,891
your dishes brought me back to the time
in my childhood that I tried to bury,

433
00:30:10,141 --> 00:30:12,560
but I didn’t want to look back at it
because it’s so painful.

434
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,063
That’s Maya.

435
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:18,942
[In Tagalog]
I will cook in a big restaurant.

436
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:22,070
Rich people will eat my food.

437
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,865
How about you?
What’s your dream?

438
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,993
My dream is for my mom to be happy.

439
00:30:29,619 --> 00:30:31,204
You cook for your mom.

440
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,789
Food makes people happy.

441
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:34,666
But being with you

442
00:30:34,749 --> 00:30:36,543
show me that I can face the past.

443
00:30:36,793 --> 00:30:39,712
The past is an ingredient
that makes me the person I am today.

444
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,090
This is my story.
