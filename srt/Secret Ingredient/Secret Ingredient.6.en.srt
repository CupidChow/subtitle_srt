Are we running away?

00:00:09,759 --> 00:00:10,926
No!

3
00:00:10,927 --> 00:00:13,929
We’re going to the Philippines
and you’ll learn English,

00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:15,931
make lots of new friends.

00:00:15,932 --> 00:00:18,559

One day I will be so rich.

6
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,312
I will cook in a big restaurant.

7
00:00:21,563 --> 00:00:24,523
Rich people will eat my food.

8
00:00:24,524 --> 00:00:25,899
How about you?

9
00:00:25,900 --> 00:00:27,359
What’s your dream?

10
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:30,237
I wish my mom can be happy every day.

11
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:31,447
You cook for your mom.

12
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:33,324
Food makes people happy.

13
00:00:33,491 --> 00:00:35,033
[In Tagalog]
I have a bad feeling about this

14
00:00:35,034 --> 00:00:37,662
because I’ve seen cuts on her wrists.

Mom!

Mom!

18
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,374
We will miss our flight.

19
00:00:41,499 --> 00:00:44,710
The chairman gave specific instructions
to take him straight to the airport.

20
00:00:44,711 --> 00:00:46,254

In a good way.

A lot has happened since I left.

00:02:00,036 --> 00:02:01,246
Indeed.

You’re confident about pulling this off?

00:02:06,292 --> 00:02:07,293
Are you?

This is your chance, Maya.

I’m here.

68
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,722
Is this why you called me so desperately?

00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:09,225
To get rid of your guilt before you die?

That’s my secret to my tasty adobo.

82
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:10,661
What does that mean?

83
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:18,336
It means food can be a way
to express one’s emotions.

84
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:19,837
Emotions?

85
00:06:19,838 --> 00:06:22,130
Through food,

86
00:06:22,131 --> 00:06:27,678
you can make someone feel what you can't say in words.

87
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:32,057
When you pour love into your food,

88
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:37,313
you can fill not only the stomach but also the heart.

89
00:06:37,688 --> 00:06:42,360
Food can cheer up anyone who is unhappy.

we can talk about giving you
what you’ve always wanted.

But you have to win.

00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:22,460
You have to secure first place.

114
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:24,795
Yes, Chef.

115
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,632
If you win,

116
00:08:27,757 --> 00:08:30,009
it will be an extraordinary achievement for us.

117
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:37,683

This must be him.

128
00:10:31,881 --> 00:10:33,299
Just show him his room.

129
00:11:28,354 --> 00:11:29,438
Please clear his plate.

130
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,650
Seems like he’s not hungry.

131
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,069
Dad says he is enrolling Ha-Joon into Ludgrove.

132
00:11:36,070 --> 00:11:38,029
Why does he get to go? And not us?

133
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,448
That’s ridiculous.

00:11:39,698 --> 00:11:42,535
Stop talking nonsense
and just finish your food!

135
00:11:42,785 --> 00:11:44,536
I will talk to your father myself.

136
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:45,871
You should go to a school that...

137
00:11:46,122 --> 00:11:48,416
matches your level.

138
00:11:55,297 --> 00:11:58,801
You bought my future with money,

139
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:02,930
but that wasn’t what I wanted.

140
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:06,267
I needed a home. I needed my mom!

141
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,603
Why did you abandon my mom like that?

142
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:13,649
I really did my best.

143
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,319
But I was just a kid.

144
00:12:22,616 --> 00:12:24,493
My poor mom...

145
00:12:40,926 --> 00:12:42,761
Ha-Joon... my son...

146
00:12:53,147 --> 00:12:57,485
You shouldn’t live like me.

147
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:07,411
The only woman I ever...
truly loved was...

148
00:13:08,787 --> 00:13:12,374
your mother... Ha-Joon.

149
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,210

died alone without you.

151
00:13:20,466 --> 00:13:22,635
I know...

152
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:30,434
I’ll never forgive myself too.

153
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:36,023
I’m sorry, Ha-Joon.

154
00:13:38,067 --> 00:13:39,902
Live your life.

00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,234
Welcome back!

156
00:14:20,859 --> 00:14:25,197
Here are the dishes our chefs
are preparing in this final round.

157
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:30,536
Most of the chefs have selected
prime premium ingredients.

158
00:14:33,581 --> 00:14:38,752
Except for Chef Maya, who seems to have chosen
as somewhat unfamiliar ingredient.

159
00:14:53,267 --> 00:14:56,227
Chef Maya is cooking a banana heart.

160
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,732
The first time we’re seeing this ingredient in this competition.

161
00:15:11,660 --> 00:15:18,709
[In Korean] Thank you all for being here
despite the busy schedule.

162
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:21,252
Today’s agenda is about

163
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:24,423
replacing Chairman Gu Won Il
who is in critical condition right now.

164
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,635
We need to vote for a new chairman for LB Group,

165
00:15:30,763 --> 00:15:32,555
Yes, LB Department Store Director Koo Seo-Young,

166
00:15:32,556 --> 00:15:33,515
do you have anything to say?

167
00:15:33,516 --> 00:15:36,435
Yes. Before the voting begins,
I would like to request to speak.

168
00:15:38,729 --> 00:15:40,564
Okay, so please keep it short.

169
00:15:42,566 --> 00:15:43,442
Yes.

170
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:47,195
It has been a little over six months
since our father, Chairman Gu felt ill,

171
00:15:47,196 --> 00:15:51,867
unable to preside over the LB Corporation as a whole.

172
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,119
So what we need most

173
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:57,456
is for a new leader to be decided.

174
00:15:57,623 --> 00:16:01,084
A leader who will lead the organization

175
00:16:01,085 --> 00:16:03,711
as it copes with the crisis facing us now!

176
00:16:03,712 --> 00:16:05,839
Therefore, I strongly recommend that my older brother,

177
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:09,510
Gu Ha-Seong be the next Chairman of this corporation.

178
00:16:15,015 --> 00:16:17,100
With the last 10 minutes remaining,

179
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:20,104
the chefs have started to fire up their dishes.

180
00:16:20,562 --> 00:16:24,233
Here we see Chef Maya dipping the banana heart
in to a batter.

181
00:16:24,483 --> 00:16:27,528
The judges seem curious about her ingredient.

182
00:16:32,324 --> 00:16:35,994
She isn’t using any of the premium ingredients
like the other chefs.

183
00:16:39,415 --> 00:16:44,670
I don’t think we’ve ever seen a banana heart
used as a main ingredient before.

184
00:17:02,396 --> 00:17:04,732
Contestants have started to plate.

185
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:10,194
Five seconds left!

186
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:12,531
Four... three...

187
00:17:12,656 --> 00:17:15,032
two... and one!

188
00:17:15,033 --> 00:17:16,618
That is the time! Hands up!

189
00:17:28,172 --> 00:17:30,590
[In Korean]
We will now proceed with the vote.

190
00:17:30,591 --> 00:17:34,178
The recommended candidates are Mr. Gu Ha-Seong
and Mr. Gu Ha-Joon.

191
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:41,017
If there are no additional nominations,
we will conduct the vote.

192
00:17:41,018 --> 00:17:41,810
First of all,

193
00:17:41,811 --> 00:17:47,691
please refer to the data provided for the management performance of the two candidates over the past three years.

194
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,448
I request to speak before the vote!

195
00:17:55,115 --> 00:17:56,282
Director Koo Seo-Jin,

196
00:17:56,283 --> 00:17:58,660
if you are not recommending a new candidate,

197
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:02,498
I think it would be better to refrain for now
due time constraints.

198
00:18:02,748 --> 00:18:05,416
There is something you need to know before voting.

199
00:18:05,417 --> 00:18:08,462
It is important information that will help determine
the future of the company.

200
00:18:23,143 --> 00:18:26,521
The judges will now evaluate the dishes.

201
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:29,399
My dish is a sophisticated take on surf and turf,

202
00:18:29,817 --> 00:18:32,778
Wagyu Steak with Black Truffles
and Lobster Mousse.

203
00:18:33,111 --> 00:18:36,614
I've prepared Sabayon with Beau Soleil Oysters,

204
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:38,325
and White Sturgeon Caviar.

205
00:18:41,036 --> 00:18:43,664
I prepared this banana heart dish, two ways,

206
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:47,751
pickled in calamansi brine and deep-fried tempura style

207
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:51,088
then I blanketed it in a rich, cream sauce.

208
00:18:51,255 --> 00:18:54,091
And there is no meat in this whatsoever, correct?

209
00:18:54,758 --> 00:18:59,054
Yes. Actually, all of these ingredients can be bought
in what we call a “palengke”

210
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,930
or a local farmer’s market.

211
00:19:00,931 --> 00:19:03,267
So all of these cost under $3.

212
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,563
But don’t you think this is too simplistic
for a final round?

213
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:11,358
Well...

214
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:14,862
I wanted to prove that a dish is more than its ingredients.

215
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:18,282
It’s the execution,

216
00:19:18,448 --> 00:19:20,993
the emotions that it evokes,

217
00:19:21,493 --> 00:19:24,037
I believe this is what elevates a dish.

218
00:19:26,957 --> 00:19:30,752
Chef Maya, is this a statement towards Food Sustainability?

219
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:34,130
I wanted to promote local and organic ingredients

220
00:19:34,131 --> 00:19:36,132
and make the most out of it.

221
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,926
Even the banana heart,
discarded in so many countries,

222
00:19:38,927 --> 00:19:42,598
but can shine just as brightly
as premium ingredients.

223
00:19:52,024 --> 00:19:55,360
It tastes different yet familiar at the same time.

224
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:10,626
The pickles mixed with the cream,

225
00:20:11,168 --> 00:20:12,920
a good balance of flavors.

226
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:16,632
The flavor profile you created is very impressive,

227
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,634
especially for a simple,

228
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,637
and dare I say, disposable ingredient.

229
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,388
Thank you.

230
00:20:41,615 --> 00:20:44,117
That’s what Gu Ha-Joon looked like yesterday afternoon.

231
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,121
As you can see, he is in Jakarta, Indonesia.

232
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:49,873
Everyone, look carefully.

233
00:20:49,957 --> 00:20:53,168
That is the person who represents our LB Corporation.

234
00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:57,422
While we all work hard day and night for the company,

235
00:20:57,965 --> 00:21:01,510
Gu Ha-Joon vacationed for months

236
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,595
and was living a life of leisure over there.

237
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:08,850
That person must be excluded as a candidate immediately.

238
00:21:09,476 --> 00:21:16,315
How can we entrust our future to a person
who acts so recklessly without any sense of responsibility?

239
00:21:16,316 --> 00:21:18,735
Gu Ha-Seong should be the only nominated candidate.

240
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:24,074
You can vote for or against based on your show of hands.

241
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:32,249
Okay. That’s enough. Thank you.

242
00:21:34,001 --> 00:21:36,294
- Oh my God!
- Oh my God!

243
00:21:37,087 --> 00:21:38,838
You did it! You won!

244
00:21:38,839 --> 00:21:40,716
Stella, thank you.

245
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:43,635
- I couldn’t have done it without you.
- Don’t say that.

246
00:21:44,052 --> 00:21:44,845
Thank you.

247
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,596
Congratulations, Maya.

248
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,265
I knew you could do it.

249
00:21:48,557 --> 00:21:49,558
Thank you, Chef.

250
00:21:49,725 --> 00:21:50,851
Well, enjoy the win.

251
00:21:51,268 --> 00:21:54,354
Have a break for a week,
and I’ll see you first thing on Monday in my kitchen.

252
00:21:55,605 --> 00:21:56,398
Chef?

253
00:21:58,233 --> 00:21:59,693
I’m a man of my word, Maya.

254
00:22:00,277 --> 00:22:01,903
So I promised to give you what you want

255
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,488
if you won first place.

256
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:05,490
So, starting next week,

257
00:22:05,949 --> 00:22:08,535
you will be the Palm Garden's newest sous chef.

258
00:22:10,912 --> 00:22:12,539
But what about Tommy?

259
00:22:14,332 --> 00:22:15,792
Don’t worry, I'll take care of it.

260
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:19,171
Think of the publicity, Maya.

261
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,422
A culinary collaboration

262
00:22:21,423 --> 00:22:25,135
between renowned chef Arif Hadi
and this year’s culinary champion.

263
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:26,595
What about that?

264
00:22:32,309 --> 00:22:33,393
Thank you...

265
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:35,312
Chef, but...

266
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:38,940
no.

267
00:22:44,780 --> 00:22:45,655
What?

268
00:22:46,615 --> 00:22:49,534
I will not work with you anymore, Chef.

269
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:53,789
I thought this is the job that you’ve always wanted.

270
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,334
No. My dream is to be an Executive Chef.

271
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:03,423
Well let’s not get ahead of ourselves, Maya.

272
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,259
Just because you won,
it doesn’t mean you’re ready for that.

273
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,888
After everything that I’ve been through,

274
00:23:11,515 --> 00:23:12,933
I know that I am.

275
00:23:36,123 --> 00:23:38,875
[In Korean]
We will now proceed with the vote.

276
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:43,672
He’s here!

277
00:24:05,402 --> 00:24:06,319
I’m sorry

278
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,863
for being late.

279
00:24:08,071 --> 00:24:11,907
I apologize for being away for months
due to personal reasons,

280
00:24:11,908 --> 00:24:14,953
and I will take full responsibility for it.

281
00:24:15,829 --> 00:24:17,955
Let’s proceed with the vote to elect the president.

282
00:24:17,956 --> 00:24:20,083
Before that, I have something to tell.

283
00:24:20,417 --> 00:24:23,294
Over the past 40 years since founding the company,

284
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:28,091
my father said he was greatly indebted with loyalty

285
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,510
to the directors of the company.

286
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,513
Director Hyun,

287
00:24:33,722 --> 00:24:37,475
do you remember the accident that happened 27 years ago

288
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:43,190
when your car flipped over on the way back to the airport
after going on a field trip to Germany with my father?

289
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:45,065
Of course, I remember.

290
00:24:45,066 --> 00:24:47,861
I am here because of him.

291
00:24:49,029 --> 00:24:51,865
Department Head of LB Electronics, Kim Jong Min,

292
00:24:53,617 --> 00:24:57,995
you were injured during the construction
of the Coast Expressway tunnel 18 years ago,

293
00:24:57,996 --> 00:25:00,331
the Chairman took care of you when your leg was injured.

294
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,292
Slightly limping, but still going strong!

295
00:25:03,293 --> 00:25:12,801
Thanks to the Chairman for comprehensive health insurance.
Life would be difficult if this had happened elsewhere.

296
00:25:12,802 --> 00:25:16,640
With all his employees, Chairman Gu has always treated

297
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:20,560
each and every one of you like his own.

298
00:25:20,852 --> 00:25:26,024
While all of this brings great memories to everyone,

299
00:25:26,274 --> 00:25:30,570
that doesn’t mean you can change
the board’s agenda today.

300
00:25:30,987 --> 00:25:32,447
Gu Ha-Joon.

301
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:35,075
Gu Ha-Joon is not qualified.

302
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,826
You all saw the video earlier.

303
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:43,291
How much embarrassment did he bring to the company.

304
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:45,627
I totally agree.

305
00:25:46,628 --> 00:25:48,546
I don’t have the qualifications to lead this company.

306
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:56,846
I withdraw from the nomination.

307
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:02,394
However, I would like to recommend a new candidate.

308
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:11,027
The candidate who exemplifies all of Chairman Gu’s vision
and values for this company, is none other than...

309
00:26:12,153 --> 00:26:14,572
Director Lee Jin.

310
00:26:15,907 --> 00:26:17,409
What?

311
00:26:18,159 --> 00:26:19,618
As you all know, Manager Lee

312
00:26:19,619 --> 00:26:23,414
is a product of the LB scholarship program.

313
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:29,379
Graduating from high school and university
with top grades and honors.

314
00:26:31,881 --> 00:26:32,965
Since then,

315
00:26:32,966 --> 00:26:36,303
he has held key positions within the company
solely based on his skills and performance.

316
00:26:37,053 --> 00:26:41,640
He has demonstrated outstanding abilities
in solving problems for the company.

317
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:48,523
As a result, he has established himself
as an irreplaceable core resource to the company.

318
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:50,066
Therefore,

319
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,445
I believe there is no one more
qualified than Director Lee Jin.

320
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:58,116
I believe that now is the time for our LB Group to break away from the old shackles of family inheritance

321
00:26:58,950 --> 00:27:04,164
and establish itself as a global company.

322
00:27:08,001 --> 00:27:09,419
Director Lee Jin,

323
00:27:12,297 --> 00:27:16,593
the Chairman himself nominated you as a candidate.

324
00:27:19,137 --> 00:27:20,597
Do you accept the recommendation?

325
00:27:26,394 --> 00:27:27,854
This is...

326
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,815
it’s too sudden.

327
00:27:31,399 --> 00:27:34,819
I will ask again.

328
00:27:37,238 --> 00:27:41,576
Do you accept the candidate recommendation?

329
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:49,501
Oppa, please say something! This is insane!

330
00:27:49,918 --> 00:27:53,088
Nonsense! This is outrageous!

331
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:57,883
Those who are voting for Director Lee Jin,

332
00:27:57,884 --> 00:27:59,552
please raise your hands.

333
00:28:32,502 --> 00:28:34,462
And the grand winner is...

334
00:28:34,671 --> 00:28:37,173
Chef Maya Laurel!

335
00:28:55,692 --> 00:28:58,027
Look at you, using your cellphone,
even though your boss is here.

336
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,867
Maya won first place.

337
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,535
I’m so proud of her.

338
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,289
Your wish came true.

339
00:29:11,499 --> 00:29:12,834
I’m proud of you too.

340
00:29:14,627 --> 00:29:15,962
I believe you will be fine.

341
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:20,049
I don’t want to say this...

342
00:29:20,967 --> 00:29:23,178
but you are a talented person that would be a shame to lose.

343
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:24,470
I’ll be back.

344
00:29:24,471 --> 00:29:27,223
I just need to take care of something.

345
00:29:28,808 --> 00:29:31,060
Say “hi” to Maya for me.

346
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:57,545
Hi, Maya. It’s me again.

347
00:29:58,796 --> 00:30:02,550
I don’t know if you’re listening to my messages
or just ignoring them, but...

348
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:06,054
please call me back.

349
00:30:07,347 --> 00:30:09,390
I know I’ve got a lot to explain to do.

350
00:30:26,824 --> 00:30:27,867
Hi, Stella.

351
00:30:28,743 --> 00:30:29,744
Hi, Jack.

352
00:30:30,036 --> 00:30:31,538
Or should I say Ha-Joon?

353
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:33,248
Sorry, I get confused.

354
00:30:33,957 --> 00:30:37,167
Okay, I’m sorry. I know...
I was meant to...

355
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,711
- I was just...
- So you are a Chaebol!

356
00:30:38,836 --> 00:30:39,796
I knew it!

357
00:30:41,381 --> 00:30:44,092
Anyway, if you’re looking for Maya,
you just missed her.

358
00:30:47,470 --> 00:30:48,471
Where’d she go?

359
00:30:55,562 --> 00:30:58,481
Congratulations again, Chef Maya Laurel.

360
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:03,610
We are happy to present to you a three-year contract

361
00:31:03,611 --> 00:31:07,615
as Executive Chef for our newest restaurant.

362
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:14,414
And I know you’re all dying to speak
with our country’s newest hero, so...

363
00:31:14,747 --> 00:31:16,249
without further ado,

364
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:19,085
Ms. Maya Laurel, everyone!

365
00:31:22,964 --> 00:31:24,132
[In Tagalog]
Chef Maya, how do you feel?

366
00:31:24,882 --> 00:31:28,344
It’s great. I am very grateful
and honored for this opportunity.

367
00:31:28,761 --> 00:31:31,764
Chef, what kind of food will you be serving?

368
00:31:48,031 --> 00:31:50,408
- What’s that?
- There are flowers.

369
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:54,621
- Look, guys.
- That’s so sweet.

370
00:32:15,725 --> 00:32:21,314
”I’m sorry. Please meet me tomorrow at this address...”

371
00:32:35,536 --> 00:32:36,913
“Maya,

372
00:32:40,792 --> 00:32:42,210
I’ve made mistakes.

373
00:32:42,877 --> 00:32:44,796
Sometimes the right way to be

374
00:32:45,046 --> 00:32:46,255
is the wrong way to go.

375
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,175
No matter how you slice it,

376
00:32:49,884 --> 00:32:51,552
rules are meant to be broken.

377
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,430
And no matter how much we try to master the rules,

378
00:32:55,181 --> 00:32:56,974
we're destined to break them.

379
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:01,104
And I made so many with you because...

380
00:33:01,521 --> 00:33:03,898
I’ve become accustomed to breaking the rules.

381
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,192
But at the end of the day,

382
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:09,195
I would rather that you remember me
for the rules I broke

383
00:33:10,822 --> 00:33:13,700
and not for your heart that I broke.

384
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:18,537
It’s incredible how the scent of the dish
can transport you back

385
00:33:18,538 --> 00:33:20,289
to your childhood in an instant.

386
00:33:22,500 --> 00:33:23,835
What I never told you

387
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:26,378
is that your dishes brought me back
to the time in my childhood

388
00:33:26,379 --> 00:33:27,630
that I tried to bury.

389
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,634
But I didn’t want to look back at it
because it’s too painful.

390
00:33:33,636 --> 00:33:35,304
That’s why I could never tell you about it.

391
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:37,849
But being with you,

392
00:33:38,057 --> 00:33:39,308
and cooking with you,

393
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:41,602
showed me that I had to face the past.

394
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:45,648
The past is an ingredient
that makes me the person I am today.

395
00:33:47,066 --> 00:33:48,735
You set me free, Maya.

396
00:33:49,986 --> 00:33:51,738
I hope that if you know my truth,

397
00:33:53,030 --> 00:33:55,324
you understand why I did,

398
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:56,909
what I did,

399
00:33:57,201 --> 00:33:58,661
and be able to forgive me.

400
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,249
This is my story,

401
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,002
which keeps leading back to you.”

402
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,076
Thank you for coming.

403
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,995
I know I’ve got a lot of explaining to do,

404
00:34:41,287 --> 00:34:43,581
and apologies to make.

405
00:34:45,541 --> 00:34:47,085
Starting with this.

406
00:34:48,252 --> 00:34:51,756
I promised you that I’d take you to cooking school
20 years ago.

407
00:34:53,132 --> 00:34:54,300
So here we are.

408
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,469
- Hi!
- Hi!

409
00:35:01,849 --> 00:35:02,850
Hi!

410
00:35:15,112 --> 00:35:16,447
Why did you lie to me?

411
00:35:17,365 --> 00:35:18,365
I’m sorry.

412
00:35:18,366 --> 00:35:21,076
I may have lied about the name
but everytime I was with you,

413
00:35:21,077 --> 00:35:23,162
that was me and that’s the truth.

414
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:27,667
I felt so lost.

415
00:35:29,418 --> 00:35:30,962
I felt like I never belonged.

416
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:34,173
But everytime I found you, that was home.

417
00:35:40,680 --> 00:35:42,139
I love you, Maya.

418
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:47,728
Ha-Joon, you...

419
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:51,440
you gave me the courage to believe in myself

420
00:35:54,026 --> 00:35:56,320
and inspired me to take chances.

421
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,616
Just like the one I’m about to take now.
