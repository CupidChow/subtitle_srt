1
00:00:04,796 --> 00:00:05,963
Maya, I'm really sorry.

2
00:00:05,964 --> 00:00:07,382
I said I don't want to talk about it.

3
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:10,718
I want to make a dish for the Davis’

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:12,428
using a kepel fruit.

5
00:00:12,429 --> 00:00:13,304
You’ve got to be kidding me.

6
00:00:13,305 --> 00:00:14,723
That’s an impossible fruit to find.

7
00:00:16,057 --> 00:00:17,224
There it is!

8
00:00:17,225 --> 00:00:18,892
This is amazing!

9
00:00:18,893 --> 00:00:21,145
How did you think of pairing this with kepel?

10
00:00:21,146 --> 00:00:23,063
I learned that Madam has a weak stomach.

11
00:00:23,064 --> 00:00:25,107
Arif stole everything from you.

12
00:00:25,108 --> 00:00:25,942
We need to talk to him.

13
00:00:25,943 --> 00:00:27,526
What do you mean “talk to him”?

14
00:00:27,527 --> 00:00:30,363
Korean regional office
wants us to find this person.

15
00:00:31,239 --> 00:00:33,615
- Those are Maya’s ideas you stole.
- Jack, it’s okay.

16
00:00:33,616 --> 00:00:35,201
You don’t know how things work here.

17
00:00:35,952 --> 00:00:38,079
Sir, we’ve been instructed to find him.

18
00:00:38,663 --> 00:00:39,914
Oh, sh♪t!

19
00:00:40,832 --> 00:00:42,292
Why are they looking for you?

20
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:48,715
I’ve made mistakes.

21
00:00:50,341 --> 00:00:52,343
Sometimes the right way to be

22
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,095
is the wrong way to go.

23
00:00:55,764 --> 00:00:57,348
No matter how you slice it,

24
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:59,476
rules are meant to be broken.

25
00:01:01,102 --> 00:01:03,855
And no matter how much we try to master the rules,

26
00:01:04,481 --> 00:01:06,274
we're destined to break them.

27
00:01:08,026 --> 00:01:10,278
And I made so many with you because...

28
00:01:10,695 --> 00:01:13,072
I’ve become accustomed to breaking the rules.

29
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:15,825
But at the end of the day,

30
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:19,788
I would rather that you remember me
for the rules I broke

31
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:23,374
and not for your heart that I broke.

32
00:02:04,249 --> 00:02:05,583
Why are they looking for you?

33
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,842
[In Korean]
Oh, sh♪t!

34
00:02:34,654 --> 00:02:36,613
- Everybody, out! Let’s go!
- What’s going on?

35
00:02:36,614 --> 00:02:37,448
What’s going on?

36
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,283
Move, move, move!

37
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,618
Let’s go! Let’s go!

38
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:42,871
Move! Move!

39
00:02:43,913 --> 00:02:45,832
Move! Move!

40
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:48,042
Move! Move!

41
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,294
Let’s go, let’s go!

42
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,004
Maya.

43
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:52,171
Go, go, go!

44
00:02:53,256 --> 00:02:56,301
[In Tagalog] What really happened?
I didn't smell anything burning.

45
00:02:58,636 --> 00:03:01,305
Maybe it's just a false alarm.
Maybe someone played a prank.

46
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:02,682
What's this? There is a lot of clutter around.

47
00:03:08,313 --> 00:03:11,691
[Maya, I already talked to your aunt,
this is your last warning.]

48
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:19,991
Are you okay?

49
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:24,287
Rodolfo came to my aunt’s house.

50
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,372
They are billing the debt to my aunt.

51
00:03:26,706 --> 00:03:27,873
Again?

52
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:29,876
Of course, who else is he going to go after?

53
00:03:30,001 --> 00:03:33,546
I feel so guilty because she doesn’t need
the stress right now.

54
00:03:36,549 --> 00:03:37,383
Maya,

55
00:03:37,926 --> 00:03:39,093
take a look at this.

56
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,222
The prize money is $35,000.

57
00:03:43,556 --> 00:03:45,599
It’ll solve your problems.

58
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,768
But I can’t afford the entry fee.

59
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:49,227
I’m sure we can come up with a solution.

60
00:03:49,228 --> 00:03:50,312
We can ask Jack for help.

61
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,065
No, I can handle this on my own.

62
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,025
Don’t tell anyone.

63
00:03:54,108 --> 00:03:56,027
But we can help you, Maya.

64
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:58,029
Stella, this is my problem to solve.

65
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,365
Don’t tell, Jack. Okay?

66
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:02,742
- Promise me.
- Okay.

67
00:04:03,034 --> 00:04:04,034
Make a promise!

68
00:04:04,035 --> 00:04:05,995
Okay, promise!

69
00:04:08,164 --> 00:04:10,165
Fire inspection is complete!

70
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:12,418
Please return to your work stations!

71
00:04:13,127 --> 00:04:14,420
Come on.

72
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:16,714
Let’s go.

73
00:04:20,635 --> 00:04:24,555
Thank you for meeting with us
despite recent hotel emergencies.

74
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:27,225
- May I?
- Please.

75
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:29,060
How do you know each other?

76
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:32,188
Actually, this troublemaker is my cousin.

77
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:34,274
He is the only child of my aunt.

78
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:37,610
So practically, he's my little brother.

79
00:04:39,821 --> 00:04:40,405
[In Korean]
Hey!

80
00:04:41,239 --> 00:04:43,074
Apologize to him, quickly!

81
00:04:44,492 --> 00:04:46,744
Go on. Just play along.

82
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,545
I'm sorry, Chef.

83
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:57,422
I complained way too much.

84
00:04:58,047 --> 00:04:59,257
Please forgive me.

85
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,599
I was the one who put this guy into your kitchen.

86
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,436
I thought that he should see the world

87
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:14,564
rather than waste his way as a failure in Seoul.

88
00:05:15,648 --> 00:05:16,816
I see.

89
00:05:17,942 --> 00:05:19,152
Chef Hadi,

90
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,196
could you make something out of him?

91
00:05:25,241 --> 00:05:26,533
I’ll see to it.

92
00:05:26,534 --> 00:05:30,455
After all, It's a request
from none other than yourself.

93
00:05:31,164 --> 00:05:32,789
So don’t worry,

94
00:05:32,790 --> 00:05:34,542
I’ll be sure to make a man out of him.

95
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:40,381
Thank you, Chef.

96
00:05:40,923 --> 00:05:42,175
Now, go back to the kitchen.

97
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:43,926
Thank you, Chef.

98
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,138
I’ll personally relay all this
to the head office in Korea

99
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,224
and make sure your patience
and kindness will be rewarded.

100
00:05:51,225 --> 00:05:52,685
Wow, really?

101
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,395
Thank you so much.

102
00:05:55,396 --> 00:05:57,732
Oh Jack, who’s that Korean guy a while ago?

103
00:05:58,274 --> 00:05:59,567
Did you know him?

104
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,445
We’re...

105
00:06:03,905 --> 00:06:05,406
sort of related.

106
00:06:08,284 --> 00:06:09,577
Are you a chaebol?

107
00:06:11,871 --> 00:06:13,706
How do you even know what that means?

108
00:06:13,873 --> 00:06:16,000
I watch K-Dramas, duh!

109
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:21,756
If I were a chaebol,

110
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:24,258
would it make a difference?

111
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,183
What's this about?

112
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:36,979
So...

113
00:06:37,313 --> 00:06:38,481
Maya.

114
00:06:39,148 --> 00:06:41,275
She has some debt.

115
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:46,405
She mentioned.

116
00:06:46,489 --> 00:06:47,490
Oh, so you know?

117
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:50,575
And you know that the interest
is always going up,

118
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:52,745
and at this rate, she’ll never be able to pay it off.

119
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,375
How serious is this?

120
00:06:57,959 --> 00:07:00,086
I mean, they won’t stop with her aunt.

121
00:07:00,503 --> 00:07:03,255
Oh my God! If anything ever happen to her aunt,

122
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:05,007
Maya would not be able to live with herself.

123
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:09,344
If I were a chaebol,

124
00:07:09,345 --> 00:07:11,973
would Maya accept money from me?

125
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,685
Probably not, but...

126
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:19,564
Why? Are you a chaebol?

127
00:07:23,568 --> 00:07:24,569
I guess not.

128
00:07:33,661 --> 00:07:38,082
[In Korean] You were very convincing
in front of Arif today with all your lies!

129
00:07:39,375 --> 00:07:40,960
You’re welcome.

130
00:07:41,502 --> 00:07:42,086
Hey.

131
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:47,633
You think that bullsh♪t was good?
You should have heard what I told the head office.

132
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:58,728
You’re somewhere in Paris right now,
sipping Bordeaux with girls.

133
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,154
Let's go back to Seoul.

134
00:08:08,237 --> 00:08:12,950
Why are you still here? Is it Maya?

135
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,955
If that's the only reason,
then just bring her to Seoul.

136
00:08:18,539 --> 00:08:19,665
Ha-Joon,

137
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:21,792
all you need to do is to make a few calls

138
00:08:21,959 --> 00:08:23,251
and she can have her own kitchen in Cheongdam-dong.

139
00:08:23,252 --> 00:08:25,379
It's not that simple.

140
00:08:30,051 --> 00:08:32,303
I haven't told her who I am yet.

141
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:35,014
You haven’t?

142
00:08:35,473 --> 00:08:37,183
What’s taking you so long?

143
00:08:37,767 --> 00:08:39,560
Just be honest with her.

144
00:08:40,686 --> 00:08:42,313
I just need to find the right time.

145
00:08:44,398 --> 00:08:45,149
Hey!

146
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:48,110
There is no such thing as perfect timing.

147
00:08:48,986 --> 00:08:50,655
You just do it.

148
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:13,844
[In Korean]
Why would you give it up so easily?

149
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,601
Why wouldn’t you fight what’s rightfully yours?

150
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,396
Mom! Mom!

151
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:55,386
[In Tagalog]
I have a weak heart, Maya!

152
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:58,430
I can’t handle this. What do I do?

153
00:09:58,431 --> 00:10:00,641
I’ll take care of this, Auntie. Don’t worry.

154
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:03,059
I’m sorry, Maya. Take care there.

155
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:04,061
Alright, I will.

156
00:10:08,316 --> 00:10:09,984
My God...

157
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:19,243
What’s going on?

158
00:10:19,952 --> 00:10:20,995
We’re here to help.

159
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,538
We agreed that we could sell food

160
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,873
to the hotel employees.

161
00:10:24,874 --> 00:10:26,374
And then with your cooking

162
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,169
and his skill in numbers,

163
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:31,005
we think we can raise enough money
to pay for the entry fee

164
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:32,214
for the competition.

165
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:36,092
Where do you get off
telling everyone my problems?

166
00:10:36,093 --> 00:10:37,636
You promised, remember?

167
00:10:39,263 --> 00:10:41,431
Maya, we’re just here to help.

168
00:10:41,432 --> 00:10:43,351
Stella, I specifically told you I can handle it.

169
00:10:43,726 --> 00:10:46,895
You said you wouldn’t tell anyone

170
00:10:46,896 --> 00:10:48,356
but you told Jack?

171
00:10:50,024 --> 00:10:51,734
You lied to me!

172
00:11:00,284 --> 00:11:01,452
Maya...

173
00:11:03,287 --> 00:11:05,206
I think you have a real shot at this.

174
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:11,253
We just want to support you
because we believe in you.

175
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:15,007
You’re one of the most talented chefs that I've ever known.

176
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,720
You’re not alone in this. We’re here for you.

177
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:51,460
Maya, can I ask a favor?

178
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:54,338
You know, since I’m a terrible cook,

179
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:58,384
I was wondering
if we could order some of your dishes?

180
00:11:59,301 --> 00:12:02,720
Your dish tastes exactly like how my mom
used to make it.

181
00:12:02,721 --> 00:12:05,974
It would be nice to somehow feel like my mom
is with us too,

182
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,269
even if we are far apart.

183
00:12:19,363 --> 00:12:22,825
I heard you’re cooking for Angela.
I wanted to order as well.

184
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:25,910
I plan to propose to my girlfriend.

185
00:12:25,911 --> 00:12:29,457
Your food is so good.
I’m sure it will add to the moment.

186
00:13:36,273 --> 00:13:37,525
Hey, guys.

187
00:13:44,907 --> 00:13:48,077
I know I was very upset last time.

188
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:49,954
But...

189
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:53,207
I realize you guys were just trying to help me.

190
00:13:57,711 --> 00:14:00,381
And I know I can be very stubborn sometimes.

191
00:14:00,965 --> 00:14:02,550
Ain’t that the truth...

192
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:08,055
You also...

193
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:10,765
lied to me, Stella, which I don’t like.

194
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:11,684
You know that.

195
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,813
That’s true.

196
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:18,816
This is the first time she’s talking to me again.

197
00:14:19,024 --> 00:14:21,902
Don’t underestimate how mad she can be...
Never lie to her.

198
00:14:22,278 --> 00:14:24,822
Even if you’re just trying to be a good friend!

199
00:14:26,949 --> 00:14:29,117
Okay! I’m sorry, Stella!

200
00:14:29,118 --> 00:14:29,785
Okay?

201
00:14:30,703 --> 00:14:31,870
I’m sorry!

202
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:33,914
I made ayam goreng [Malaysian fried chicken].

203
00:14:35,332 --> 00:14:36,166
Okay!

204
00:14:36,542 --> 00:14:37,750
- Okay?
- Okay!

205
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,835
- Forgiven.
- Forgiven?

206
00:14:38,836 --> 00:14:40,421
- Okay.
- Okay, here!

207
00:14:41,463 --> 00:14:43,424
Guys, you want instant noodles?

208
00:14:48,804 --> 00:14:50,389
You guys were right.

209
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:52,307
I do need to take some action,

210
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:55,436
just so I could get myself out of this financial hole.

211
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,856
Jack, if the offer still stands,

212
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:02,568
I would love your help in selling lunchboxes.

213
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,992
Of course.

214
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,458
Why are you being so kind to me?

215
00:15:19,752 --> 00:15:21,420
You were kind to me first.

216
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,524
Hi!

217
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:44,693
- Hey.
- Hey. Wait.

218
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,574
What’s all of this?

219
00:15:51,450 --> 00:15:52,993
- What’s this?
- I got it from work.

220
00:15:53,202 --> 00:15:55,829
I convinced Sam, our pantry manager,
to let me have these.

221
00:15:56,330 --> 00:15:57,872
I mean, there’s always overstock

222
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,750
and instead of throwing all it away,

223
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,335
I figure we can use these.

224
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,463
We help lower the hotel’s overall food waste

225
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,383
and this lowers our cost of ingredients.

226
00:16:07,841 --> 00:16:08,925
I mean, look at these,

227
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:10,302
these all good for consumption.

228
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,681
It’s a shame it’s categorized as overstock.

229
00:16:15,557 --> 00:16:16,558
Wow!

230
00:16:17,101 --> 00:16:19,186
All of this for the box lunches?

231
00:16:19,353 --> 00:16:21,437
Yeah, and with this amount,

232
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:23,732
we should be able to cover her entry fee.

233
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,860
Best part is...

234
00:16:27,236 --> 00:16:28,112
this!

235
00:16:32,991 --> 00:16:33,867
You’ll get it.

236
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:37,788
Anyways, I took a look at our orders and...

237
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:40,998
if we sell this many...

238
00:16:40,999 --> 00:16:43,627
plus the percentage of labor cost

239
00:16:43,961 --> 00:16:46,629
and save this much,

240
00:16:46,630 --> 00:16:50,843
then we should be able to have this much...

241
00:16:54,138 --> 00:16:55,848
Are you sure that’s enough?

242
00:16:56,598 --> 00:17:00,519
Ah... Yes, if we exclude my share.

243
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,397
Yeah, you can take my share too.

244
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:08,401
No, if you are both working on this,

245
00:17:08,402 --> 00:17:10,653
then you guys have to be compensated as well.

246
00:17:10,654 --> 00:17:12,114
This is not a charity.

247
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:16,284
Yeah. Uhm, okay.

248
00:17:16,285 --> 00:17:18,454
Uhm, we can charge about...

249
00:17:19,121 --> 00:17:20,330
this much.

250
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:24,752
I don’t know you guys.
I don’t know if that’s enough.

251
00:17:25,294 --> 00:17:27,211
I don’t even think we’ll get enough orders.

252
00:17:27,212 --> 00:17:30,673
I probably talked to 15 or 16 people.

253
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:31,884
Yeah, about that...

254
00:17:32,634 --> 00:17:33,886
we have more orders.

255
00:17:43,187 --> 00:17:44,188
Wow!

256
00:17:46,440 --> 00:17:48,525
All these people placed orders?

257
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,068
Yes.

258
00:17:51,653 --> 00:17:54,865
Maya, you'll have a chance to
join the competition now.

259
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:12,734
- I have to try it.
- Okay.

260
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,486
Try it.

261
00:19:16,530 --> 00:19:18,615
- What happened?
- It’s... hot.

262
00:19:19,616 --> 00:19:20,492
Is it bad?

263
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,786
No, it’s good. It’s good. This is really hot.

264
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:23,954
Okay.

265
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:35,983
Smells good.

266
00:20:35,984 --> 00:20:37,027
What’s cooking?

267
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:39,111
This is Kare-kare.

268
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:41,323
My mom used to cook this for me.

269
00:20:47,829 --> 00:20:50,332
So, how do you know when it’s right?

270
00:20:53,669 --> 00:20:55,087
If you know, you know.

271
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:01,134
Have you ever wished...

272
00:21:01,843 --> 00:21:04,012
you could have lived your life differently?

273
00:21:04,304 --> 00:21:05,263
I don’t know like...

274
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:07,140
started out your career earlier?

275
00:21:10,769 --> 00:21:11,812
Nope.

276
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:14,481
I’d do it all over again.

277
00:21:16,024 --> 00:21:17,274
There were times, yeah,

278
00:21:17,275 --> 00:21:18,360
when it was hard.

279
00:21:18,568 --> 00:21:21,238
Especially her last few years but...

280
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,700
when she passed away I...

281
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:28,704
I missed her so much.

282
00:21:29,913 --> 00:21:32,749
And I’d give absolutely anything

283
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,543
just to be with her again.

284
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,590
Even if it means having to re-live her hardest days.

285
00:21:49,599 --> 00:21:50,559
What about you?

286
00:21:52,477 --> 00:21:55,313
Do you ever wish
you could have done things differently?

287
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:02,779
I’d... never let anyone hurt my mom.

288
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,912
I just can’t forgive myself.

289
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,250
I can understand.

290
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,172
With my mom’s condition,

291
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,174
I remember,

292
00:22:22,841 --> 00:22:25,427
I just wanted to blame everyone else
for what happened,

293
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:27,095
the hospital,

294
00:22:27,721 --> 00:22:29,139
the doctors,

295
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:32,601
our family and friends that weren’t there for us.

296
00:22:33,101 --> 00:22:34,811
I was so angry.

297
00:22:36,021 --> 00:22:37,939
So angry at everyone.

298
00:22:39,608 --> 00:22:41,818
But then I realized

299
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:45,238
if I wanted to move on,

300
00:22:49,868 --> 00:22:51,536
I...

301
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,332
I needed to forgive.

302
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,835
And...

303
00:23:01,171 --> 00:23:03,673
Forgiving gave me the peace that I needed.

304
00:23:17,437 --> 00:23:19,730
I have been hearing rumors

305
00:23:19,731 --> 00:23:23,984
that some of your kitchen staff
are going against company policies

306
00:23:23,985 --> 00:23:28,155
by selling packed meals to hotel employees.

307
00:23:28,156 --> 00:23:29,032
That's impossible.

308
00:23:30,575 --> 00:23:31,326
Are you sure?

309
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:35,455
Who else could be supplying food
to our hotel workers?

310
00:23:35,539 --> 00:23:37,123
Well, not someone from my kitchen.

311
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,166
They wouldn’t dare.

312
00:23:39,417 --> 00:23:41,086
I certainly hope not.

313
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:45,297
This kind of thing could tarnish your reputation

314
00:23:45,298 --> 00:23:47,676
and the reputation of the hotel.

315
00:23:58,895 --> 00:24:01,231
Okay... So, how much did we make?

316
00:24:01,731 --> 00:24:05,485
Uhm, we sold a total of 105 meals over the week.

317
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:08,404
After deducting the cost of packaging,

318
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:10,699
and if we take out Stella's and my share...

319
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,577
it still doesn’t cover the entry fee.

320
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:19,582
Even if we work another week,

321
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:20,959
it's still not enough.

322
00:24:21,293 --> 00:24:23,837
Our initial expenses were much higher than expected.

323
00:24:25,505 --> 00:24:27,423
Yeah, but good ingredients are important.

324
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:29,634
I couldn’t serve them anything subpar.

325
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:32,303
Okay, then let me fill in the gap with my share.

326
00:24:32,304 --> 00:24:34,138
As I already told you, money is not the problem.

327
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,056
It’s not a question.

328
00:24:35,057 --> 00:24:36,182
Okay, then take mine.

329
00:24:36,183 --> 00:24:37,975
You have to stop being so stubborn, Maya.

330
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,394
I'm not being stubborn.

331
00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:40,979
I just...

332
00:24:42,355 --> 00:24:44,191
I just want to do things fairly.

333
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,442
Okay, but you also have to be realistic.

334
00:24:46,443 --> 00:24:47,902
Because this is the second time this week

335
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:49,529
that Rodolfo has harassed your auntie.

336
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,199
And winning this competition is your only hope!

337
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:54,074
I don’t even know if I stand a chance.

338
00:24:54,075 --> 00:24:56,285
Wait. Rodolfo is still bothering you?

339
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:58,955
Yeah, he won’t stop harassing her aunt and...

340
00:24:59,539 --> 00:25:01,500
we’re worried that he’ll go to extremes.

341
00:25:07,422 --> 00:25:09,382
All right. Uhm, so...

342
00:25:09,591 --> 00:25:10,716
We have two options.

343
00:25:10,717 --> 00:25:11,927
Option number one...

344
00:25:13,303 --> 00:25:14,888
we raise the food prices.

345
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,265
I don’t know if our customers can afford that.

346
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:19,892
Okay, then option number two,

347
00:25:19,893 --> 00:25:22,229
in addition to the current orders,

348
00:25:22,812 --> 00:25:24,648
we make ten more lunch boxes.

349
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,857
Can we do that?

350
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,734
Yeah, you’re so close,

351
00:25:27,817 --> 00:25:28,985
what’s another 10 boxes?

352
00:25:35,325 --> 00:25:36,785
Okay, fine!

353
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:40,538
Just another ten more boxes,
and then we're done, okay?

354
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,123
Before we get caught.

355
00:25:57,764 --> 00:25:59,015
It’s really bad,

356
00:25:59,307 --> 00:26:00,809
the situation with her aunt.

357
00:26:02,269 --> 00:26:04,396
He’s been hounding her for weeks.

358
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,313
We don’t know what he’s going to do next,

359
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,856
but her aunt has a weak heart,

360
00:26:07,857 --> 00:26:10,610
and Maya’s feeling helpless.

361
00:26:46,521 --> 00:26:48,523
Have you heard about the rumors going around?

362
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:52,736
What kind of rumors, Chef?

363
00:26:53,987 --> 00:26:57,741
They say someone is selling food
to hotel employees.

364
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:06,791
You know I trust you, Maya.

365
00:27:09,461 --> 00:27:10,837
If you hear anything,

366
00:27:11,129 --> 00:27:12,005
please let me know.

367
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:12,964
Immediately.

368
00:27:14,507 --> 00:27:15,342
Yes, Chef.

369
00:27:17,886 --> 00:27:19,262
Help me find out who it is

370
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:21,473
and we will talk about that promotion for you.

371
00:28:13,608 --> 00:28:15,276
- [In Korean] Is that it?
- Should we go in?

372
00:28:29,749 --> 00:28:31,626
We are looking for Rodolfo.

373
00:28:34,379 --> 00:28:35,672
Rodolfo!

374
00:28:35,964 --> 00:28:37,798
[In Tagalog]
There are people looking for you!

375
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,676
- Rodolfo, hurry up!
- Yeah, I’m coming!

376
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:43,847
Who are you?

377
00:28:44,013 --> 00:28:46,850
We are on behalf of Ms. Maya Laurel.

378
00:28:46,933 --> 00:28:48,184
Maya...

379
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:49,477
The daughter of Maria?

380
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:51,603
Who borrowed money from me,

381
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,730
and then disappeared.

382
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:54,607
Who are you?

383
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,734
Her boyfriends?

384
00:28:57,944 --> 00:29:00,238
We just want to help Maya settle her debts.

385
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,406
She owes you a million pesos, right?

386
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:04,742
If you’re going to settle it as a whole...

387
00:29:05,201 --> 00:29:07,119
it will be around two million pesos

388
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,163
plus the interest.

389
00:29:08,371 --> 00:29:09,581
Do you find it amusing

390
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:12,250
haggling over someone's life
with that sort of money?

391
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,711
[In Tagalog]
What’s the problem with that wh♪re?

392
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:16,838
You are the wh♪re.

393
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:34,313
Would you please sign right here.

394
00:29:34,314 --> 00:29:37,441
You will be signing this confirmation
that Maya has paid off all of her debts to you,

395
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:39,360
equivalent to $50,000.

396
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:40,403
Understood?

397
00:29:41,738 --> 00:29:44,406
If, by any chance, I find you near Maya,

398
00:29:44,407 --> 00:29:46,867
her aunt or anyone that she cares about,

399
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,453
I will come back to this place.

400
00:29:48,703 --> 00:29:49,829
Do you understand?

401
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:52,957
Yes... yes.

402
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:57,170
[In Korean]
Good enough for you?

403
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:01,341
Kind of...

404
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,968
I need to go back.

405
00:30:04,427 --> 00:30:06,304
Those adobos aren't going to deliver themselves.

406
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:22,694
- I’m sorry, I’m late.
- Oh my God! Where were you?

407
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:24,280
We’ve been waiting for you the whole day.

408
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,615
I had to deal with something.

409
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:28,993
What’s wrong with your hand?

410
00:30:29,452 --> 00:30:31,037
This? Oh, it’s nothing.

411
00:30:32,539 --> 00:30:33,498
I cut myself.

412
00:30:33,831 --> 00:30:35,166
I was handling knives.

413
00:30:35,667 --> 00:30:36,334
Okay.

414
00:30:36,335 --> 00:30:39,379
Well, these are the lunch boxes
that need to be delivered asap.

415
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:40,380
Got it.

416
00:30:41,965 --> 00:30:43,173
These aren’t labeled.

417
00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:45,218
Yeah, Maya will know which ones which.

418
00:30:45,885 --> 00:30:47,095
Right, where is she?

419
00:30:47,595 --> 00:30:48,388
With Arif.

420
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:49,806
Let’s go.

421
00:31:00,275 --> 00:31:02,694
Maya, something is missing.

422
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,829
Chef...

423
00:31:13,621 --> 00:31:14,747
Try this.

424
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:22,338
You always read my mind.

425
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:46,988
You continue to impress me, Maya.

426
00:31:49,407 --> 00:31:50,533
I see myself in you.

427
00:31:52,285 --> 00:31:53,453
Thank you, Chef.

428
00:31:58,499 --> 00:32:01,794
You follow every instruction brilliantly,

429
00:32:02,962 --> 00:32:04,922
that’s why I’ve decided to give you the...

430
00:32:05,506 --> 00:32:06,424
promotion.

431
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:09,135
Really, Chef?

432
00:32:11,804 --> 00:32:12,680
Really...

433
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,413
We found them, Arif.

434
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:42,752
We found our crooks!

435
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:28,339
I’m sorry.

436
00:33:28,423 --> 00:33:29,173
No.

437
00:33:29,174 --> 00:33:30,508
I want to start over.

438
00:33:30,550 --> 00:33:32,342
I’m going to join the competition.

439
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,262
I want to see how far I can go.

440
00:33:34,887 --> 00:33:36,556
I won’t let you fight this alone.

441
00:33:36,764 --> 00:33:38,932
[In Korean] I know she matters to you.

442
00:33:38,933 --> 00:33:40,183
But the people here in Korea,

443
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:42,269
the people that trust and rely on you,

444
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:43,812
don’t they mean anything to you?

445
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:45,398
You need to come back right now!

446
00:33:45,690 --> 00:33:46,898
[In Tagalog]
Maya, I heard you’ve got a boyfriend now.

447
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:47,899
A rich Korean guy?

448
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,318
I’m sure that’s how you got in.

449
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,403
He paid for you, right?

450
00:33:51,404 --> 00:33:52,321
One second! Please!

451
00:33:52,322 --> 00:33:54,239
What’s all of this, a publicity stunt?

452
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,032
Who are you?
