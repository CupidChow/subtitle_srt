[Speaks in Korean]
It’s time to go to the airport.

2
00:00:46,337 --> 00:00:48,214
You sure you won’t change your mind?

3
00:00:49,674 --> 00:00:50,842
Yes, I’m sure.

4
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:53,845
Your flight to Jakarta is scheduled for 10:00 pm.

5
00:00:56,931 --> 00:00:58,391
Okay, thanks.

6
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:01,060
Take care.

7
00:03:36,466 --> 00:03:38,467
Jack! Are you going to do this all day?

8
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:39,552
No, Chef.

9
00:03:40,136 --> 00:03:43,097
Damn Novice chef! What’s he even doing here?

10
00:03:48,061 --> 00:03:48,561
Hey.

11
00:03:48,853 --> 00:03:49,896
It’s not that hard.

12
00:03:50,104 --> 00:03:51,189
I’ll show you. Okay?

13
00:03:51,814 --> 00:03:52,440
So...

14
00:03:52,732 --> 00:03:54,609
The first thing you’ll do is twist the head,

15
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,569
- pull it out.
- Hm-hmm.

16
00:03:58,446 --> 00:03:59,822
Then you just twist that.

17
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:01,783
And then it will come off.

18
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:11,875
- Yup, exactly.
- Ah, okay.

19
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:12,876
Don’t worry about it.

20
00:04:12,877 --> 00:04:14,379
- You’ll get the hang of it.
- All right.

21
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,634
Maya. Uhm...

22
00:04:22,136 --> 00:04:23,388
Thanks.

23
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:33,022
All right, listen up.

24
00:04:34,649 --> 00:04:36,484
Now that we’re almost through
with the lunch service,

25
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:38,361
I have two announcements to make.

26
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:41,364
First, on Wednesday night
there will be a big event.

27
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:44,408
Mr. Mark Davis, part of our board of directors,

28
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,951
he will be staying here at the hotel

29
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,787
and celebrating his birthday here
at the Palm Garden.

30
00:04:48,788 --> 00:04:51,164
I’ve been told that he flew all the way from America

31
00:04:51,165 --> 00:04:53,084
just to personally sample my food.

32
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:56,587
We are going to prepare the best meal
that he’s ever had in his life.

33
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:59,423
I’m thinking a 12 course meal,
with some new dishes to add.

34
00:04:59,424 --> 00:05:01,843
And everything has to be absolutely perfect!

35
00:05:02,051 --> 00:05:05,721
I will not accept even the slightest mistake
on such an occasion.

36
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:06,472
Do you understand?

37
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,598
[all]
Yes, Chef!

38
00:05:07,599 --> 00:05:08,849
I know we don’t have a lot of time,

39
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,100
but I know we can pull this off.

40
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:10,935
You know how I know?

41
00:05:11,060 --> 00:05:12,937
Because this is my kitchen.

42
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:16,733
And my kitchen stands only for excellence.

43
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:18,025
Do you get it?

44
00:05:18,026 --> 00:05:19,277
[all]
Yes, Chef!

45
00:05:19,318 --> 00:05:20,111
Second announcement.

46
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:23,114
You may all know that we have an opening
in the rotisseur (meat chef) position, right?

47
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,074
I’ve decided to create a challenge

48
00:05:25,283 --> 00:05:28,202
for whoever wants to move up
and take the spot.

49
00:05:28,619 --> 00:05:31,413
All right. You will need to prepare
a meal worthy enough

50
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,166
to be added to our 12 course menu

51
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:36,878
for Mr. Davis’ birthday celebration.

52
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,381
Whoever’s dish Chef Arif deems worthy enough,

53
00:05:41,007 --> 00:05:42,759
will be added to the menu.

54
00:05:42,884 --> 00:05:45,845
And you will be promoted
to the brand new "Chef de Partie”.

55
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,806
All right! Let’s get back to your stations

56
00:05:48,973 --> 00:05:50,015
and keep working!

57
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,350
[all]
Yes, Chef!

58
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,316
So, who do you think is going to win?

59
00:05:58,775 --> 00:06:00,068
Hard to say, Chef.

60
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:03,446
I mean, Charles has been the most consistent.

61
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:04,405
But Maya...

62
00:06:05,364 --> 00:06:07,574
she’s the best at technical execution,

63
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:08,950
I’m just not sure if she’s good enough

64
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:10,745
to produce a good enough dish on her own.

65
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,164
It’s the only thing I know.

66
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,417
Interesting.

00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:22,006
So I hear that Mr. Davis is bringing a chef
all the way from London with him.

68
00:06:22,381 --> 00:06:23,800
Are you worried about it, Chef?

69
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:26,052
No, I’m not worried.

70
00:06:26,219 --> 00:06:27,428
Don’t worry Chef,

we’re going to make them drool for your food.

72
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,058

[speaks in Bahasa]
There’s that Korean guy, Jack.

74
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:48,699
We still have no clue as to what he’s doing here.

75
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:50,700
How long has it been?

76
00:06:50,701 --> 00:06:52,036
Two months.

77
00:06:56,290 --> 00:07:01,378
I heard from the Hall Manager that his family...

78
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:02,296
is rich.

79
00:07:02,297 --> 00:07:05,424
Why would a rich Korean come here?

80
00:07:06,008 --> 00:07:07,677
And work in a kitchen?

81
00:07:08,886 --> 00:07:12,098
Maybe he killed someone...

82
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:14,475
and he’s on the run.

83
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,105
Hey.

84
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:20,940
Do not mess with him.

85
00:07:21,149 --> 00:07:22,316
He’s dangerous.

86
00:07:22,567 --> 00:07:23,693
Why’s that?

87
00:07:25,570 --> 00:07:26,779
You see that guy?

88
00:07:27,363 --> 00:07:29,157
They say the Korean did that to him.

89
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,079
That’s not true.

90
00:07:35,454 --> 00:07:36,789
Leave him alone.

91
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,418
But he slows us down in the kitchen.

92
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:44,964
Give him some time,
he’s trying to adjust to a new country.

93

I sure could use meals like this
after a long day at work.

That’s a great idea. We can earn a lot.

Is it the debt collectors?

Why are they texting you?
Your payment isn’t even due yet.

183
00:15:33,307 --> 00:15:34,683
the flavors are lacking.

184
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:38,312
It’s a little under seasoned.

185
00:15:39,855 --> 00:15:41,065
Okay, Chef.

186
00:15:41,982 --> 00:15:44,443
Good effort, Maya, but moving on.

187
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,988
I am determined to win.

188
00:15:48,072 --> 00:15:51,200
It’s the last chance I have to pay off my debt.

189
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:16,016
Hey...

190
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:18,101
I’m really sorry, I thought we had a...

191
00:16:18,102 --> 00:16:20,854
It’s okay. I didn’t think I had a chance anyway.

192
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:22,606
I did.

193
00:16:24,191 --> 00:16:25,943
We had the best dish out there.

194
00:16:27,111 --> 00:16:28,362
Well...

195
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:30,531
Arif didn’t think so.

196
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:32,825
Well I disagree with Arif.

197
00:16:34,910 --> 00:16:37,079
Our dish was a hundred times better.

198
00:16:43,627 --> 00:16:44,586
You know what...

199
00:16:45,546 --> 00:16:46,839
You want to get some coffee?

200
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,424
At this hour?

201
00:16:49,383 --> 00:16:50,551
I know a place.

202
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,095
You like dogs, right?

203
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,768
Hello, my boy!

204
00:16:59,935 --> 00:17:01,686
Nice to see you!

205
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:03,147
It's always good to see you.

206
00:17:03,313 --> 00:17:06,150
So it’s okay for us to stay at this hour, right?

207
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:07,734
Just have fun.

208
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:09,445
Thank you, thank you so much.

209
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:17,703
- Hello, little one. Come here.
- Oh, hi!

210
00:17:18,954 --> 00:17:20,581
Hi!

211
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:24,543
- Hi!
- So May is an old friend.

212
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:28,297
I come here to see her from time to time.

213
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:31,550
Especially since I got to see these little fellas!

214
00:17:34,511 --> 00:17:35,471
I thought...

215
00:17:36,054 --> 00:17:38,766
we might need this after a day like today.

216
00:17:39,933 --> 00:17:41,602
How did you know I like dogs?

217
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:43,395
I had a hunch.

218
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,408
What happened?

219
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:02,289
Hi.

220
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:05,751
Hi.

221
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:07,669
Can I get you?

222
00:18:08,086 --> 00:18:09,213
Hey.

223
00:18:15,385 --> 00:18:16,970
He seems comfortable with you.

224
00:18:19,264 --> 00:18:21,183
You seem to know your way around with dogs,

225
00:18:21,266 --> 00:18:22,267
even people.

226
00:18:22,976 --> 00:18:25,062
I got a lot of practice where I come from.

227
00:18:27,189 --> 00:18:28,398
Do you miss home?

228
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,068
I miss the home I once knew.

229
00:18:32,152 --> 00:18:34,404
The one that had my mom with it.

230
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:43,872
Where is she now?

231
00:18:45,749 --> 00:18:48,585
She passed away a few years ago.

232
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:53,131
- Uhm, sorry. I shouldn't have asked.
- Oh no, it’s okay.

233
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:55,300
She was sick for a long time.

234
00:18:57,177 --> 00:18:58,804
Must have been hard for you.

235
00:19:03,559 --> 00:19:05,144
Yeah, but...

236
00:19:07,479 --> 00:19:09,231
I didn’t mind.

237
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,442
It was just me and my mom
for as long as I can remember.

238
00:19:13,443 --> 00:19:15,487
So when she passed away,

239
00:19:17,030 --> 00:19:18,907
I...

240
00:19:21,243 --> 00:19:23,370
I didn’t quite know what to do with myself.

241
00:19:26,582 --> 00:19:28,333
This is why you love cooking so much.

242
00:19:29,418 --> 00:19:31,044
Definitely.

243
00:19:31,628 --> 00:19:33,881
She taught me everything I know.

244
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:38,510
And I cook somehow to feel...

245
00:19:39,636 --> 00:19:41,388
closer to her.

246
00:19:44,474 --> 00:19:47,811
[speaks in Korean]
She must be in a better place now.

247
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:52,941
That’s nice.

248
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:57,154
You know, I had a Korean friend
in the Philippines growing up.

249
00:19:58,030 --> 00:19:59,781
- In the Philippines?
- Yeah.

250
00:20:01,199 --> 00:20:03,118
Were you guys close?

251
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,124
I don’t know.

252
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:13,462
We were so young then...
I don’t remember much now.

253
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,621
It’s getting late, we should probably go but...

254
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:50,040
Thank you for this. This was really nice.

255
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:53,085
I’m glad. Uhm...

256
00:20:53,168 --> 00:20:56,754
I’m just going to tell May
that we’re going to head out.

257
00:20:56,755 --> 00:20:57,339
Okay.

258
00:20:58,006 --> 00:21:00,467
Okay. You go back there and get better.

259
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:02,052
Thank you.

260
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:09,935
[speaking in Korean]
Wow... You’re really a fraud.

261
00:21:10,227 --> 00:21:13,063
Hey, I did you a favor.

262
00:21:13,730 --> 00:21:17,192
How dare you put me in the kitchen?

263
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,569
I'm peeling shrimp all day!

264
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,490
It’s the perfect hiding place for you,

265
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,576
and I can’t believe you’ve lasted this long.

266
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,914
And my fingers always smell like shrimp.

267
00:21:31,123 --> 00:21:36,211
I’d stay all night peeling shrimps
if there was that pretty chef next to me.

268
00:21:36,753 --> 00:21:37,629
Have you confessed yet?

269
00:21:40,424 --> 00:21:42,050
Confessed what?

270
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:44,344
She doesn’t know who I am.

271
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:45,595
What?

272
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:47,222
Oh, right,

273
00:21:47,472 --> 00:21:49,140
you're supposed to be Jack Lee over there

274
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:50,976
not Seoul's Prince Gu Ha-Joon.

275
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:52,978
But why are you still hiding this from her?

276
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:56,565
It's not that simple.

277
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,526
I just want her to treat me as who I really am

278
00:21:59,735 --> 00:22:05,574
not LB Group’s Gu Ha-joon.

279
00:22:06,491 --> 00:22:09,828
You’re going to win her with your personality?

280
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:13,498
Good luck man, your personality isn’t that great.

281
00:22:14,416 --> 00:22:17,002
Should you be talking to me like this?

282
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,381
Don't forget, I'm still your boss.

283
00:22:25,677 --> 00:22:26,677
Good to see you.

284
00:22:26,678 --> 00:22:28,013
Haven’t seen you in two months.

285
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:29,723
Yeah, good to see you too.

286
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,683
How long are you going to keep this up?

287
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:35,854
I seriously don't know.

288
00:22:36,605 --> 00:22:38,857
He’s getting worse.

289
00:22:39,107 --> 00:22:41,943
You need to come back before it's too late.

290
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:50,345
Chef...

291
00:23:51,429 --> 00:23:52,806
Can you taste this, please?

292
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:02,858
What's going on?

293
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,028
What is this?

294
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:09,406
Ah, Chef, we received the first delivery

295
00:24:09,865 --> 00:24:12,576
but it got delayed because of the traffic.

296
00:24:13,660 --> 00:24:15,703
It’s a bit off.

297
00:24:15,704 --> 00:24:16,705
A bit off?

298
00:24:17,539 --> 00:24:19,248
Are you suggesting that I should serve

299
00:24:19,249 --> 00:24:20,876
this garbage to my guests?

300
00:24:22,878 --> 00:24:24,171
Change the menu right now.

301
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,673
Chef, we don't have enough time.

302
00:24:31,553 --> 00:24:32,304
Maya!

303
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:34,389
Yes, Chef?

304
00:24:34,681 --> 00:24:36,224
Can you prepare your shrimp quiche?

305
00:24:38,476 --> 00:24:39,603
Yes, Chef, I can do it!

306
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:41,104
- Then do it, quickly.
- Yes, Chef.

307
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,202
Yeah, sure.

308
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:04,252
Okay. This is hot.

309
00:25:06,254 --> 00:25:07,714
It smells good.

310
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:10,508
Chef...

311
00:25:14,095 --> 00:25:15,263
Hmm, as I thought.

312
00:25:15,472 --> 00:25:16,640
Not spicy enough.

313
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,140
Double the paprika.

314
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,227
- And add ginger to give it a kick.
- Yes, Chef.

315
00:25:21,728 --> 00:25:24,022
I have a lot riding on this dinner, Maya, but...

316
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:25,148
I trust you.

317
00:25:25,815 --> 00:25:28,568
I trust you that you can execute this brilliantly.

318
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:30,070
Yes, Chef.

319
00:25:31,738 --> 00:25:32,614
Chef!

320
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,124
Hi, Mr. Davis.

321
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:45,168
It's a pleasure to have you here, Sir.

322
00:25:45,335 --> 00:25:46,378
Thank you for having us.

323
00:25:48,046 --> 00:25:49,214
What are you doing, Jack?

324
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:50,799
Aah! Just...

325
00:25:51,424 --> 00:25:52,509
I got a leg cramp.

326
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:54,885
Okay. I have to get ginger and paprika.

327
00:25:54,886 --> 00:25:55,929
Are you going to be okay there?

328
00:25:56,304 --> 00:25:57,555
Ah, yes. I’ll be alright.

329
00:25:57,973 --> 00:25:58,807
Okay.

330
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:07,983
Have you met Chef Luke?

331
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,694
He’s from London
and is the latest James Beard awardee.

332
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,070
Nice to meet you.

333
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,030
It’s a pleasure. I’m a big fan.

334
00:26:14,614 --> 00:26:16,908
We’ve come a long way
to taste your food, Chef Arif.

335
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,119
Thankfully, everything has been great...

336
00:26:20,870 --> 00:26:21,621
so far.

337
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:25,166
But here, this lady

338
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,961
is also a renowned gourmet.

339
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:30,547
She's quite a well-known influencer and knows...

340
00:26:31,047 --> 00:26:32,799
everybody worth knowing in Korea.

341
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:37,679
Hi, I’m Chaerin Song.

342
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,180
Thank you for coming tonight.

343
00:26:43,059 --> 00:26:46,771
In fact, Chaerin is the daughter
of my most important business partner.

344
00:26:47,814 --> 00:26:51,066
She came to Bali for a vacation
and stopped by on my father’s behalf

345
00:26:51,067 --> 00:26:52,360
to celebrate my birthday.

346
00:26:52,610 --> 00:26:55,030
Wow, thank you for sharing
your precious time with us.

347
00:26:55,864 --> 00:26:58,742
I wish there were more chefs like you in Korea.

348
00:26:59,117 --> 00:27:01,077
All of your dishes have been very good...

349
00:27:01,244 --> 00:27:03,538
very traditional,

350
00:27:03,788 --> 00:27:05,831
wouldn’t you say, Chef Luke?

351
00:27:05,832 --> 00:27:07,667
Yes. I agree.

352
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:08,960
Very classical.

353
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:14,341
I think the meal would be more perfect
if there was more of an oomph...

354
00:27:14,674 --> 00:27:15,759
to your food?

355
00:27:16,676 --> 00:27:18,010
- Oomph?
- Yes.

356
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:21,389
Something that’s so unforgettable,
that when you go back home

357
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:23,141
you still think about it.

358
00:27:26,019 --> 00:27:27,604
She’s definitely a foodie, right?

359
00:27:28,188 --> 00:27:29,688
Look, Arif.

360
00:27:29,689 --> 00:27:32,817
You know, I guess, I'm looking forward
to that last oomph as well.

361
00:27:33,193 --> 00:27:35,278
I mean, you got to keep up
with those trends, am I right?

362
00:27:53,296 --> 00:27:54,339
Maya, we’re in trouble...

363
00:27:54,464 --> 00:27:55,215
Uhm...

364
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,132
What?

365
00:27:56,299 --> 00:27:58,385
- All right. Ready for plating?
- Yes, Chef.

366
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:08,228
All right, ladies and gentlemen...

367
00:28:09,521 --> 00:28:14,483
We have a shrimp quiche brined in black tea
with truffle manchego cheese.

368
00:28:14,484 --> 00:28:17,487
- Please, enjoy.
- Thank you.

369
00:28:38,425 --> 00:28:39,926
Hmm.

370
00:28:40,718 --> 00:28:41,970
This is exceptional.

371
00:28:42,679 --> 00:28:44,097
Delicious!

372
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:47,559
Was this the oomph you’re looking for, Ms. Chaerin?

373
00:28:47,892 --> 00:28:51,312
Yes! This is it.

374
00:28:56,443 --> 00:28:58,486
Oh, no. Thank you so much.

375
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,238
Thank you, thank you.

376
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:01,906
Thank you so much. Thank you...

377
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,784
Excellent.

378
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:06,286
I’m glad you liked it, Sir.

379
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:08,163
It was great.

380
00:29:08,413 --> 00:29:09,581
It’s a pleasure.

381
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,879
Thank you so much. Thank you, Sir.

382
00:29:19,174 --> 00:29:20,758
It seems like...

383
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:22,343
it’s okay.

384
00:29:39,736 --> 00:29:41,320
Honey... What’s wrong?

385
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,113
What is it?

386
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:43,156
You’re choking?

387
00:29:44,699 --> 00:29:45,408
Honey...

388
00:29:49,245 --> 00:29:49,954
Honey...

389
00:30:24,697 --> 00:30:25,740
Oh, f♪ck.

390
00:31:00,567 --> 00:31:01,359
Please, Chef,

391
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,694
give me one more chance.

392
00:31:03,236 --> 00:31:06,196
I want to make a dish using a kepel fruit.

393
00:31:06,197 --> 00:31:07,573
I’ll bet my job on it.

394
00:31:07,574 --> 00:31:08,992
I’d hate to lose you.

395
00:31:15,873 --> 00:31:17,791
- Those are Maya’s ideas you stole.
- Jack, it’s okay.

396
00:31:17,792 --> 00:31:19,042
You don’t know how things work here.

397
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:20,169
Who do you think you are?
