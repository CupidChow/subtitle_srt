1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:05,340


2
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:40,920
 Touch Your Heart 

3
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:02,540
Are you okay, Oh Jin Sim?

4
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,480
Don't get out, Mr. Lawyer.

5
00:01:39,350 --> 00:01:41,570
What is it?

6
00:01:53,290 --> 00:01:56,070
I asked you what is it.

7
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,060
I mistook her for someone else.

8
00:02:01,060 --> 00:02:05,000
I thought she was someone I knew, but she's not.

9
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,500
Mr. Lawyer!

10
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,960
Are you alright?

11
00:02:48,830 --> 00:02:53,620
What did he say? Why did he chase us?

12
00:02:55,430 --> 00:02:59,050
He said he mistook you for someone else.

13
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:05,180
He didn't mistake me for someone else.

14
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,050
He was indeed chasing me.

15
00:03:09,110 --> 00:03:11,960
- That person— 
 - I know.

16
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:18,570
I know that person made your life difficult.

17
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:25,990
That is why I didn't want to let him go like that.

18
00:03:34,430 --> 00:03:38,500
 Seeing you happy by yourself, I'm feeling betrayed. 

19
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:42,840
 Then, let's meet again, Oh Yoon Seo. 

20
00:03:53,390 --> 00:03:56,520
Don't do this, Mr. Lawyer.

21
00:03:57,310 --> 00:04:01,400
I don't want to provoke that person.

22
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:07,240
I don't want to be involved with him anymore.

23
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:41,200
 Episode 11 

24
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:50,230
Thank you for taking me home.

25
00:04:50,230 --> 00:04:52,090
Yes.

26
00:05:19,610 --> 00:05:25,420
It makes me anxious to leave you by yourself. Can I stay with you tonight?

27
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,680
At first...

28
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,630
He approached me saying he was my fan.

29
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,830
 Thank you very much, CEO Lee Kang Joon. 

30
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:02,320
 I heard that Director Han Sang Cheol is considering Yoon Seo for his new blockbuster movie. 

31
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:04,250
 Yes. 

32
00:06:04,250 --> 00:06:09,020
 Although I am her fan, setting aside my bias, 

33
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:12,110
 I felt that she would match this movie well. 

34
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:16,220
 On this happy day, I can't just stay still. Let me pour you a drink. 

35
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:23,350
-  Please accept this.  
-  I'm honored. 

36
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,790
 Yoon Seo. 

37
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:45,460
-  Drink a glass.  
-  l don't drink much. 

38
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:51,790
 Hurry up. 

39
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:14,220
 Yoon Seo, are you okay? 

40
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:21,910
 Drink a glass. 

41
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:46,660
 Where are we? 

42
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:51,360
 Are you awake? 

43
00:07:55,290 --> 00:07:58,950
 Why do you look displeased? 

44
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:03,970
 I'm really happy. 

45
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,660
 All night long... 

46
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:11,750
 I can look at my woman. 

47
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:18,330
 I will take my leave. 

48
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:25,450
-  Cheers! 
 -  You all worked hard. 

49
00:08:25,450 --> 00:08:30,700
 I have never seen teamwork this great before! I'm speechless! 

50
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,690
 Ms. Yoon Seo, the director is looking for you. 

51
00:08:33,690 --> 00:08:36,650
-  Right now? 
 -  Yes. 
 -  I'll be back. 

52
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,970
 Sure. 

53
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:46,710
 Back then, I shouldn't have followed him. 

54
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,360
 Director? 

55
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:06,300
 What are you doing? 

56
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,240
 Yoon Seo. 

57
00:09:09,340 --> 00:09:11,530
 I love you. 

58
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:13,990
 What are you saying? 

59
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:17,350
 What should I do... 

60
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:22,180
 For you to know how I feel? 

61
00:09:24,580 --> 00:09:27,380
 What's wrong with your expression? 

62
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:32,250
 I said I love you! I LOVE YOU! 

63
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,230
 We are from the Department of Drugs at Gangnam Police Station.  

64
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,920
 We are arresting without warrant Mr. Lee Kang Joon for illegal use and distribution of drugs. 

65
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:44,510
 What are you saying? Yoon Seo! 

66
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:48,400
-  Let go! 
 -  Stay still! 

67
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:50,390
 Yoon Seo! 

68
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:56,320
 That's how my drug scandal exploded. 

69
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:02,720
In the end, I was cleared of the charges by the court.

70
00:10:03,590 --> 00:10:09,170
However, because of the fact that I was in that position, I was caught up in all kinds of rumors.

71
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,860
"I was falsely accused."

72
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:18,940
"I'm being stalked."

73
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:25,300
No matter how many times I said it, nobody listened to me.

74
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,600
Negative and hateful articles kept on being published.

75
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,930
Those times...

76
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:41,230
were really difficult to endure.

77
00:10:42,910 --> 00:10:47,600
I felt like I was falling apart. So,

78
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,240
I stopped there.

79
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:57,420
Back then, I was really scared of the person who made me like this,

80
00:11:00,650 --> 00:11:03,550
the people who were surrounding me,

81
00:11:04,290 --> 00:11:10,400
and the people who started rumors about me. It was scary and terrible.

82
00:11:14,830 --> 00:11:19,100
You don't have to tell me any more.

83
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:22,730
No. I wanted to tell you

84
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,360
one of these days

85
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,910
so that you don't misunderstand me.

86
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:50,330
Yes.

87
00:11:51,910 --> 00:11:54,570
I'm not misunderstanding anything.

88
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:57,350
Don't worry about anything.

89
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,020
You should hurry and get some sleep too, Mr. Lawyer.

90
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:23,040
Okay. I'll sleep after I see you fall asleep.

91
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,570
That's something that I wasn't able to tell anyone all that time.

92
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:36,830
Because I've told you everything,

93
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,710
my heart feels more at ease.

94
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:44,260
Do you remember what I said before?

95
00:12:44,260 --> 00:12:49,820
I said that the person who committed the wrong should suffer, not the victim,

96
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:52,080
that you should quickly forget the bad memories

97
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:54,740
and be happier than anyone else.

98
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:58,980
That's right. I remember.

99
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,950
I'm going to make it so you can do that.

100
00:13:02,690 --> 00:13:04,850
So that you can be happier than anyone else.

101
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:12,250
So don't be afraid. Let's conquer this together.

102
00:14:22,390 --> 00:14:24,570
Oh. You're up, Mr. Lawyer?

103
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:26,030
Yes.

104
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:29,880
What are you doing?

105
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:33,140
What does it look like? I'm making breakfast.

106
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:37,110
Mr. Lawyer, you should have breakfast before you go to work.

107
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,320
Ah, this is soybean paste stew. You like it, right?

108
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:49,540
- Yes.
 - Do you want to taste it?

109
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:06,330
- Wow.
 - It's good, isn't it?

110
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,670
I'm soybean paste stew genius now, aren't I?

111
00:15:08,670 --> 00:15:12,290
Yes. You're as good as a soybean stew paste restaurant now.

112
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:14,280
But I won't tell anyone else about it.

113
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:16,930
Okay. Let's hurry up and eat

114
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:20,850
and then go to your house and let you change. Then let's go to work together.

115
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:22,110
Okay.

116
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,430
Alright, if I just put the tofu in...

117
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:44,700
I will overcome this with you, Mr. Lawyer.

118
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,300
As you can see, Jeong Ji Ho has definitely embezzled.

119
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:59,100
When there no lack of evidence proving that billions have gone into his pocket—

120
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,480
What about the bribery case of the CEO of the steel company in a slump which I told you to handle?

121
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:05,190
Department Head, I can't just let Jeong Ji Ho go like this.

122
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:07,570
Didn't you predict this would happen when you put me in charge of the case?

123
00:16:07,570 --> 00:16:08,840
That I wouldn't give up?

124
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:11,200
Do you not know who Choi Yoon Soo is?

125
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:12,880
He was the Ace of the special department.

126
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:15,170
That kind of person is Jeong Ji Ho's lawyer.

127
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:18,740
He has probably already bought all the witnesses and evidence!

128
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:21,180
Do you think you can stand against him?

129
00:16:21,950 --> 00:16:26,610
Department Head, are you scared of Choi Yoon Soo or the person behind Choi Yoo Soo?

130
00:16:26,610 --> 00:16:28,300
What, you punk?

131
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:32,910
 Records of Evidence 

132
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:43,300
Mr. Prosecutor, are you really going to end things like this?

133
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,270
I don't know when it will be,

134
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,910
but a day will come when I open this box again.

135
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:50,280
Let's work together then.

136
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,870
This is a truly regretful situation.

137
00:16:55,730 --> 00:16:59,660
You said that you still love your husband, but you're thinking of divorcing him.

138
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,620
What is your reason?

139
00:17:02,710 --> 00:17:05,520
Because my husband has completely changed.

140
00:17:06,290 --> 00:17:11,020
He used to tell me he loved me twelve times a day.

141
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:13,970
But these days he uses the excuse that he's busy

142
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:16,450
and only says it twice.

143
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:19,630
That's ten less times than he used to, right?

144
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:22,820
- What?
 - That's not all.

145
00:17:22,820 --> 00:17:26,920
My husband used to be someone who knew me better than anyone else.

146
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:30,830
But a few days ago, he said we should eat while we were watching a drama

147
00:17:30,830 --> 00:17:33,420
and bought a chicken.

148
00:17:33,420 --> 00:17:34,980
What is the problem with that?

149
00:17:34,980 --> 00:17:37,720
One chicken is only eaten by one person.

150
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:42,000
As I watched my husband tearing the chicken and eating it,

151
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:45,370
I felt like my heart was being picked apart.

152
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:50,070
So how can I live with him? I have to separate from him.

153
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:55,540
I'm sorry to tell you this,

154
00:17:55,540 --> 00:17:59,330
but this reason isn't as significant as I thought.

155
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:02,340
There's no definite proof that your husband changed, either.

156
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:06,230
I'm telling you, my husband changed!

157
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,470
He's a mean person who hurt my heart!

158
00:18:14,770 --> 00:18:18,800
Of course, making a woman cry isn't something that a good man would do.

159
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:23,120
Here. Wipe your tears and calm down.

160
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:37,800
- Thank you.
 - You can keep it.

161
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:44,540
Yes, then please head on.

162
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,940
Oh! Yeah, Mom. Huh?

163
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:57,380
You said tomorrow's my birthday?

164
00:18:57,380 --> 00:19:00,790
A present that I want? I'm fine.

165
00:19:00,790 --> 00:19:06,080
You birthed such a perfect person like me, so I should be the one getting you a gift.

166
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,660
I'll see you later, Mom. Yes.

167
00:19:13,120 --> 00:19:15,870
Tomorrow is his birthday?

168
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:31,060
Lawyer Dan, are you worried about something?

169
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:36,290
That's... Actually, there's a person that I like these days.

170
00:19:36,290 --> 00:19:37,860
Again?

171
00:19:39,710 --> 00:19:41,220
And so?

172
00:19:41,220 --> 00:19:45,730
That is... Tomorrow is a happy day for him, so I want to celebrate it.

173
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:48,830
What kind of present should I get?

174
00:19:48,830 --> 00:19:52,270
If it's a one-sided crush, then it's best to get a simple gift that isn't too burdensome.

175
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:56,200
If it's mutual love, then it would be best to use this opportunity to move your relationship one step forward.

176
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,840
Maybe while buying him a meal?

177
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,890
That is... It seems like a one-sided crush,

178
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:05,280
but it also seems mutual. Do you want to hear about it once?

179
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:11,130
 First, he appeared like a white knight and helped me once. 

180
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:15,080
 Second, he gifted me with something because I said I needed it. 

181
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:19,100
 Don't worry about it. Just buy me a drink some time. 

182
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:23,970
If it was a present, then it seems like it isn't fake this time. It seems like he really does have feelings for you.

183
00:20:23,970 --> 00:20:25,950
Really?

184
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:30,500
It seems like he definitely is interested in you, so use this opportunity to strike. Invite him out to eat tomorrow.

185
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:34,220
What about alcohol?

186
00:20:34,220 --> 00:20:37,650
That man told me to buy him alcohol sometime first.

187
00:20:37,650 --> 00:20:43,450
That's good. Dress prettier than normal and make his heart race.

188
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:47,960
But... how should I dress if I'm going to dress prettily?

189
00:20:47,960 --> 00:20:49,610
I've never dressed up properly before.

190
00:20:49,610 --> 00:20:51,720
Do you possibly know his ideal type of woman?

191
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,280
I think it would be good if you dressed as closely to his ideal type as possible.

192
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:58,240
His ideal type?

193
00:20:59,650 --> 00:21:02,190
His ideal type, she said.

194
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:15,250
- Lawyer Dan!
 - Yes?

195
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:17,170
What? Do you have something to say to me?

196
00:21:17,170 --> 00:21:19,170
No. Who?

197
00:21:19,170 --> 00:21:21,690
Just now, you...

198
00:21:33,540 --> 00:21:35,140
- Ah, I'm tired.
 - Goodness.

199
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:39,200
Alright, the meal was delicious, so I'll buy the coffee! I'll take your orders.

200
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:41,210
Um, then I'd like an espresso.

201
00:21:41,210 --> 00:21:43,330
- A cafe mocha for me, then.
 - A latte for me.

202
00:21:43,330 --> 00:21:47,170
- I'd like a latte, too.
 - This may be a bit presumptuous, but I'd like a latte shot.

203
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:50,270
I'd like a strawberry cream frappe with a lot of whipping cream.

204
00:21:50,270 --> 00:21:53,410
But Yoon Seo, can you memorize all of this? You don't need to write it down?

205
00:21:53,410 --> 00:21:58,030
Um, an espresso for Mr. CEO, a cafe mocha for Secretary Yang,

206
00:21:58,030 --> 00:22:00,190
a latte for Hae Young and Joo Hwan,

207
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:02,690
and a latte shot for Pil Si.

208
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:06,540
Office Manager wants a strawberry cream latte with lots of whipped cream.

209
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:11,030
And since Mr. Lawyer likes instant coffee, I'll make him some back at the office.

210
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,840
How did you memorize all that?

211
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,290
I'm killer at memorization.

212
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,610
Then, I'll quickly go and buy coffee. I'll be back.

213
00:22:18,610 --> 00:22:19,970
I'll help you. Let's go together.

214
00:22:19,970 --> 00:22:21,810
- Let's go together!
 - I'll help, too.

215
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:27,100
Wow, it's an honor to drink the coffee that the universe's goddess Yoon Seo buys.

216
00:22:27,100 --> 00:22:31,460
But doesn't Yoon Seo seem especially motivated and bright today?

217
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:33,270
It's really nice.

218
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:41,150
 The former CEO of Empire Entertainment Lee Gang Joon 

219
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:48,880
 Returns As Vice-President of Empire Holdings 

220
00:22:50,430 --> 00:22:53,390
So he's back for good.

221
00:22:59,110 --> 00:23:02,260
Oh Jin Sim, it's time to go home.

222
00:23:04,690 --> 00:23:07,030
Oh Jin Sim?

223
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:09,400
Y-Yes, Mr. Lawyer?

224
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,970
I was saying that it's time to go home.

225
00:23:10,970 --> 00:23:16,050
Oh. I'll just make some copies of this first.

226
00:23:28,370 --> 00:23:30,750
 The Former CEO of Empire Entertainment Lee Gang Joon Returns As Vice-President of Empire Holdings 

227
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,930
Oh Jin Sim.  There is a case this time in which the Supreme Court sitting en banc changed its opinion.

228
00:23:55,930 --> 00:23:59,600
I'll write down the precedent number, please track it down for me.

229
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:15,770
  Tonight, let's have a date.  

230
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,340
Okay, I will find it quickly for you.

231
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:41,530
Why an amusement park, all of a sudden?

232
00:24:41,530 --> 00:24:44,900
From time to time, I looked up the dramas that you starred in,

233
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:49,000
and the places that the male lead took the sad heroine to make her feel better

234
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:52,350
were the beach and the amusement park.

235
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,960
So I was debating as to which place to bring you,

236
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:59,180
and thought that you might have twice the enjoyment if I brought you to this amusement park which is near the beach.

237
00:24:59,180 --> 00:25:03,760
Additionally, one of the perks is that although the amusement park is small, not many people frequent it,

238
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,290
thus, I thought it was the rational choice.

239
00:25:08,120 --> 00:25:12,100
Thank you for thinking of me this much.

240
00:25:15,610 --> 00:25:18,770
You don't have to put in so much effort.

241
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:24,150
- Excuse me? 
 - It will be difficult to overcome everything all at once,

242
00:25:24,150 --> 00:25:27,310
so let's take things step-by-step.

243
00:25:27,310 --> 00:25:32,370
I will always be by your side and be of strength to you, Oh Jin Sim.

244
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:36,630
I feel very reassured.

245
00:25:37,580 --> 00:25:39,640
- Oh Jin Sim!! 
 - Are you okay?

246
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:43,360
Oh Jin Sim, Oh Jin Sim!!

247
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,220
Hold on tight!

248
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:51,110
Oh Jin Sim! Don't worry!

249
00:25:51,110 --> 00:25:52,410
Mr. Lawyer, are you okay?

250
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:56,340
I will prote... don't worry. I will protect you.

251
00:25:58,990 --> 00:26:01,250
Put your hands up! Woohoo!

252
00:26:01,250 --> 00:26:05,920
Oh Jin Sim! Ahhhhh!! Please stop this! STOP IT!

253
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:10,130
Put your hands up! Mr. Lawyer, Mr. Lawyer! Snap out of it!

254
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:15,220
- Are you okay? 
 - Oh yes, I will protect you!

255
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:21,120
Please stop this, I beg of you! Please stop this!

256
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:33,180
I am okay, Oh Jin Sim.

257
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:38,290
Mr. Lawyer, I didn't know you were afraid of the rides.

258
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:41,900
I'm not afraid.  This is just the first time I've ridden them since elementary school.

259
00:26:41,900 --> 00:26:45,220
I think it is more accurate to say that I was a little nervous about the unfamiliar environment.

260
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,510
Also, I am also adapting to it quickly.

261
00:26:47,510 --> 00:26:53,370
Oh, then shall we ride it one more time? In order to increase your adaptability?

262
00:26:53,370 --> 00:26:58,780
No, it's okay! I will be satisfied with this level of adaptability for today.

263
00:26:58,780 --> 00:27:02,960
Just be truthful, you were scared, right?

264
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,430
- No. 
 - What do you mean no? You were definitely afraid.

265
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:08,440
I told you I wasn't afraid.

266
00:27:10,260 --> 00:27:13,060
Are you mad? Your tone sounds annoyed.

267
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:16,900
Mr. Lawyer, your proprietary patented prickly tone came out.

268
00:27:16,900 --> 00:27:20,740
What do you mean proprietary patent? This is the first time that I've heard I'm prickly.

269
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:25,540
They must all say it behind your back. You're so prickly, Mr. Lawyer.

270
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:29,030
When I first met you, I was so surprised.

271
00:27:29,030 --> 00:27:32,230
Out of all the people I had seen, you were the most prickly.

272
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:39,000
Of course, now, you're the gentlest.

273
00:27:41,190 --> 00:27:46,010
Now that I look at it, I think there is some resemblance.

274
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,270
What do you mean, resemblance?

275
00:27:48,270 --> 00:27:52,450
Ah, I hear from time to time, that I resemble an actor.

276
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:54,730
A hedgehog! Mr. Lawyer, you resemble a hedgehog.

277
00:27:54,730 --> 00:27:55,650
A hedgehog??

278
00:27:55,650 --> 00:27:58,480
Yeah, a hedgehog is like that.

279
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,270
On the outside, it seems picky and spiky but when you get to know it, it's cute!

280
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:09,200
Mr. Lawyer, you're like that. Mr. Lawyer, you're a hedgehog.

281
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:12,570
Ah, yes. A hedgehog.

282
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:20,320
Oh my, the cotton candy is so cute! Did you see it?

283
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:21,860
Ah yes.

284
00:28:24,430 --> 00:28:26,610
I will go quickly to buy some.

285
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,950
Sir, can I have a teddy bear cotton candy?

286
00:28:31,950 --> 00:28:35,270
- I'm sorry, operating hours have ended. 
 - Excuse me?

287
00:28:37,510 --> 00:28:40,670
Boss, I'm so sorry but could you please just make one more?

288
00:28:40,670 --> 00:28:44,630
This cotton candy can be of comfort and strength to someone.

289
00:28:44,630 --> 00:28:48,370
It could also be a driving force to overcome one's fears.

290
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,060
This cotton candy could?

291
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:53,890
Yes. So, please.

292
00:28:53,890 --> 00:28:56,300
Okay, I got it.

293
00:29:05,450 --> 00:29:09,140
  ♫ It's then that the wind blew ♫  

294
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:11,520
- Fighting! 
 -Thank you! 
   ♫ Now I look through another memory. ♫  

295
00:29:11,520 --> 00:29:13,310
Oh Jin Sim!

296
00:29:13,310 --> 00:29:16,090
Oh! 
   ♫ I mean even the star at night ♫  

297
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:17,800
  I'm sorry!  

298
00:29:17,800 --> 00:29:21,520
- Oh no! What should I do? 
   ♫ made me think of you ♫   

299
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:25,870
  ♫ I just want to be a star for you. ♫  

300
00:29:27,550 --> 00:29:32,000
Oh whew. It was a white bear before... 
 ♫   It's contained in my hidden feelings ♫  

301
00:29:33,430 --> 00:29:35,570
It became a black bear!

302
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:38,710
  ♫ I will hug you. ♫  

303
00:29:38,710 --> 00:29:43,560
It's my fault. I should have been careful when I took each step. 
   ♫I just want to be your star with my heart ♫  

304
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:47,730
Or when we collided, if only I had held the bear above my head and protected it... 
    ♫ full of shining starlight ♫  

305
00:29:47,730 --> 00:29:53,370
It's okay! When I look it, the back of its head doesn't have any dirt on it.

306
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:56,910
Let's eat the back of its head! 
   ♫ I'll fill up your dark night ♫  

307
00:29:56,910 --> 00:30:00,460
Yum! 
  ♫ With my whole heart ♫  

308
00:30:00,460 --> 00:30:02,730
Mr. Lawyer, you try it too! Ah...ahhh

309
00:30:10,170 --> 00:30:11,960
Oh Jin Sim!

310
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:14,500
Oh! What is this?

311
00:30:14,500 --> 00:30:16,360
- Fireworks? 
 - Yes!

312
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:19,640
I also got the idea for this from one of your dramas.

313
00:30:19,640 --> 00:30:25,010
When coming to the beach, they all had fireworks. Just wait for a moment.

314
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:32,250
Here. Feel free to look forward to it!

315
00:30:32,250 --> 00:30:33,840
Woohoo!

316
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:48,900
I heard that there are some cases where there are faulty ones, occasionally.

317
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:01,090
Why...is it like this...

318
00:31:06,290 --> 00:31:09,530
It should work now right?

319
00:31:28,300 --> 00:31:32,730
Selling these defective products... I must immediately file a complaint with the Consumer Protection Agency.

320
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:34,730
And also file for compensation for the damages!

321
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:41,060
Oh my! It's so pretty!

322
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:45,130
Mr. Lawyer, why don't you push back the filing for the compensation of damages, and instead, why don't we enjoy the fireworks?

323
00:31:45,130 --> 00:31:47,680
But those aren't our fireworks.

324
00:31:47,680 --> 00:31:52,090
If we enjoy and watch them, then they are our fireworks. Come on, hurry!

325
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:57,540
Ah, they're so pretty!

326
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:03,430
I'm sorry, Oh Jin Sim.

327
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:06,190
What? Why?

328
00:32:06,870 --> 00:32:10,740
I brought you here because I wanted you to have a good time, Oh Jin Sim.

329
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,910
But I was more afraid of the amusement park rides than you were.

330
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:19,230
I made of mess of the cotton candy that you really wanted to eat, and even the fireworks...

331
00:32:21,720 --> 00:32:24,130
I think I messed it all up.

332
00:32:24,890 --> 00:32:29,990
All the male characters in the dramas seem to be able to make you happy, Oh Jin Sim.

333
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,820
I had the best time, better than any of the scenes from the dramas.

334
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:41,270
Because...

335
00:32:42,820 --> 00:32:47,320
This time, I came with someone who I truly love.

336
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:53,390
He's really my boyfriend and truly treasures me.

337
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:58,810
So, I had the most enjoyable time. Truly.

338
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:08,620
I feel confident that if I am with you, Mr. Lawyer, I can overcome anything

339
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,690
Will you be able to sleep alone tonight?

340
00:33:41,690 --> 00:33:43,340
Of course.

341
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:47,910
If anything happens, please call me.

342
00:33:48,450 --> 00:33:52,630
Even if nothing happens, I'll still call you. I need to hear your voice before I sleep.

343
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,920
- Then, head in safely. 
 - Yes.

344
00:34:19,210 --> 00:34:25,080
You didn't have to come pick me up. Weren't you inconvenienced this morning because of me?

345
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,890
It's okay.

346
00:34:27,490 --> 00:34:31,240
Nothing will really happen from now on, so there is no need to be concerned.

347
00:34:31,240 --> 00:34:32,750
Okay.

348
00:34:43,330 --> 00:34:47,090
Mr. Lawyer, why are you speeding all of a sudden?

349
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,470
Just because.

350
00:35:10,690 --> 00:35:14,600
Oh Jin Sim, why don't you head up first? I'll make a call then head up.

351
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,420
- Ah okay. Then I will head up first.
 - Okay.

352
00:35:32,350 --> 00:35:34,220
Who are you?

353
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,550
When you film someone without their consent,

354
00:35:37,550 --> 00:35:39,740
you are not only liable for damages for violation of portraiture rights, but if

355
00:35:39,740 --> 00:35:41,620
it caused sexual humiliation, you can be punished also for

356
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,190
violation of The Special Act on Punishment for Crimes Involving Sexual Violence.

357
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:47,060
Did I take a picture of you?

358
00:35:47,060 --> 00:35:49,440
You were probably taking pictures of me.

359
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:54,750
I hope you won't do this again.

360
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:59,760
It would be better for me to tell him this myself.

361
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,420
  Seeing you happy while I'm not makes me feel betrayed. Then, I'll see you again, Oh Yoon Seo.  

362
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,840
This is Oh Yoon Seo.

363
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:11,080
I wasn't able to greet you properly because the situation didn't allow for it yesterday.

364
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:14,250
I thought that there would be no reason for me to see you ever again.

365
00:36:14,250 --> 00:36:16,530
If you keep having people trail me like this,

366
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:19,530
a reason for us to meet may come up.

367
00:36:19,530 --> 00:36:21,470
In the courtroom.

368
00:36:22,170 --> 00:36:26,320
During the time we haven't seen each other, you've become fearless.

369
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:30,000
Yes. I'm not that scared of you anymore.

370
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,500
I'll take this. Because if we go to court later,

371
00:36:40,500 --> 00:36:44,400
I have to use it as a piece of evidence.

372
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:02,270
How did you know to come?

373
00:37:02,270 --> 00:37:05,380
Because you were subtly worrying the whole time you were driving.

374
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:08,150
Once I took a look, I found that there was a car following us.

375
00:37:08,150 --> 00:37:12,040
But since you told me to go up first,

376
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,360
I thought that you were going to that car that was tailing us.

377
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:18,610
So I was watching so that I could call the police if anything happened.

378
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,370
I did well, right?

379
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:28,090
Are you really okay?

380
00:37:28,090 --> 00:37:32,400
I'm okay. I told you that we would overcome this together.

381
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:38,290
Yes. But are you also thinking of suing him?

382
00:37:39,700 --> 00:37:42,260
I'm not sure.

383
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,120
Since I've warned him, I'll just have to wait and see for now.

384
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:49,470
Truthfully, getting involved with him again and becoming an issue

385
00:37:49,470 --> 00:37:52,720
is a little burdensome, too.

386
00:37:59,420 --> 00:38:02,090
By the way, did Lawyer Kwon and Yoon Seo say that they weren't drinking coffee?

387
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:03,920
Yes, I guess they were busy.

388
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,660
But I haven't seen Lawyer Dan since earlier.

389
00:38:06,660 --> 00:38:09,620
She said that she would be a little late because she was going to stop by court.

390
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:12,960
Everyone, good morning.

391
00:38:21,790 --> 00:38:24,480
Everyone is here.

392
00:38:32,660 --> 00:38:34,460
But, what's with you?

393
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,350
Are you challenging me with your fashion just because I gave you some pressure about raising your performance?

394
00:38:38,350 --> 00:38:42,550
If you thought that this would scare me, then you hit the jackpot. I'm seriously scared right now.

395
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:46,740
Mr. CEO, why are you picking on me?

396
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:49,560
Anyway, I'm sorry that my performance was low.

397
00:38:49,560 --> 00:38:52,800
So that I can meet your expectations in the future, I will become

398
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,180
a Dan Moon Hui who works much harder.

399
00:38:57,250 --> 00:38:59,670
I'll work hard.

400
00:38:59,670 --> 00:39:02,530
She said that she'll work hard. Am I the only one who's scared?

401
00:39:02,530 --> 00:39:04,350
I'm asking if I'm the only one who can't take this.

402
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,210
Mr. CEO, why are you being like that?

403
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:10,200
I don't think that Lawyer Dan's transformation today is bad.

404
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,750
There's this saying: "It isn't a sin for a woman to transform herself."

405
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,890
Then, I'll

406
00:39:21,890 --> 00:39:24,200
head in first.

407
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,600
I'm really scared, though.

408
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:35,240
What 's going on? You're even taking Lawyer Dan's side.

409
00:39:37,550 --> 00:39:39,370
It's because I thought of the past.

410
00:39:39,370 --> 00:39:43,010
When I went on a trip to Spain,

411
00:39:43,010 --> 00:39:46,710
I got tired of always looking clean-cut and neat,

412
00:39:46,710 --> 00:39:50,670
so I went around like a gypsy just like that during the whole trip.

413
00:39:50,670 --> 00:39:52,960
You're saying that Lawyer Dan's looks are on the level of a gypsy right now.

414
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,090
Well, more than saying that she's on the level of a gypsy,

415
00:39:56,090 --> 00:39:59,290
I'm saying that when you're in a state of mind where you want to just let yourself go,

416
00:39:59,290 --> 00:40:04,220
if people around you stop you, you go astray even more.

417
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:20,970
What are you doing in my office?

418
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:28,350
That's because there's something that I want to ask you, Lawyer Choi.

419
00:40:28,350 --> 00:40:32,660
What are you doing this evening?

420
00:40:32,660 --> 00:40:36,750
I'm not sure. I don't have any real plans.

421
00:40:36,750 --> 00:40:40,660
Then will you spend the evening with me today?

422
00:40:40,660 --> 00:40:42,470
What?

423
00:40:42,470 --> 00:40:46,390
Back then, you told me to buy you a glass of alcohol as you were giving me the ukelele.

424
00:40:46,390 --> 00:40:49,250
I'm planning to buy that today. Accidentally,

425
00:40:49,250 --> 00:40:52,270
I happened to find out that today is your birthday,

426
00:40:52,270 --> 00:40:55,780
so I think that it would be good to buy you a meal and give you a present all in one.

427
00:40:57,660 --> 00:41:00,210
It's a gift, right?

428
00:41:00,210 --> 00:41:01,610
What?

429
00:41:03,170 --> 00:41:06,870
Why would I drink alcohol with you on my birthday?

430
00:41:06,870 --> 00:41:09,760
I have dinner plans with my mother today.

431
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:14,150
I don't have a girlfriend or a woman that I like on my birthday this year,

432
00:41:14,150 --> 00:41:17,760
so I made a reservation at a French restaurant to go out to eat with my mother.

433
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:22,930
So, please buy me the alcohol another time, Lawyer Dan.

434
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,910
Hurry up and get out.

435
00:41:28,140 --> 00:41:30,030
Okay.

436
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:40,880
Hey, you punk. That's all you can do? Huh?!

437
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,500
Vice-President!

438
00:42:00,910 --> 00:42:02,640
Ah, what is it?

439
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:06,010
What in the world is it that you're in this kind of mood?

440
00:42:06,010 --> 00:42:08,500
That is... CEO Yeon,

441
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,100
I think that, for this drama,

442
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:14,010
we won't be able to work with Yoon Seo.

443
00:42:14,600 --> 00:42:17,830
What in the world are you saying?

444
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:20,070
I'm sorry, Mr. CEO.

445
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:22,610
There's a company that said they would invest in us,

446
00:42:22,610 --> 00:42:27,220
but it seems like they heard that Yoon Seo would be the main character.

447
00:42:27,220 --> 00:42:33,770
But the CEO there said that he won't invest in Yoon Seo.

448
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,130
Why? Because of her scandal?

449
00:42:37,130 --> 00:42:40,160
That's something that we also don't...

450
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,680
You're really too harsh.

451
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:43,450
You know fully well that Yoon Seo

452
00:42:43,450 --> 00:42:46,110
is working at a law firm as a secretary to appear in this drama, so how could you...?

453
00:42:46,110 --> 00:42:48,250
That's why, if it were possible,

454
00:42:48,250 --> 00:42:51,150
we would like to work with Yoon Seo. But what can we do?

455
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:54,890
We have to get investments in any way that we can and make this drama.

456
00:42:54,890 --> 00:42:56,780
It's taken several months for this investor to appear,

457
00:42:56,780 --> 00:43:00,700
so we also have no choice.

458
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,300
Excuse me, Mr. CEO. I'm really sorry, but

459
00:43:05,300 --> 00:43:08,710
could I have that investor's contact information?

460
00:43:08,710 --> 00:43:12,770
I'll meet with him personally and try to persuade him.

461
00:43:18,110 --> 00:43:21,720
What? The CEO of the investment company?

462
00:43:21,720 --> 00:43:24,580
So when did you decide on meeting him?

463
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:30,220
I'll go too, Mr. CEO. I'll go with you and try to persuade him.

464
00:43:30,220 --> 00:43:33,420
Yes. I'll see you after I get off work later.

465
00:43:35,750 --> 00:43:38,080
Is something wrong?

466
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:41,910
It's nothing.

467
00:43:51,480 --> 00:43:52,610
It was my misunderstanding again.

468
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,320
  Tell me the truth properly!!  

469
00:43:54,320 --> 00:43:55,920
It's a misunderstanding!

470
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,280
A misunderstanding? My wife told me

471
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:00,630
that you said that men who make women cry are horrible,

472
00:44:00,630 --> 00:44:04,450
so she was talking about separation and said you told her to get a divorce!

473
00:44:04,450 --> 00:44:07,160
No, that's... That's not what I meant!

474
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:11,100
On top of that, she said that you gave her this handkerchief

475
00:44:11,100 --> 00:44:12,910
as a gift!

476
00:44:12,910 --> 00:44:15,770
- If this isn't seduction, then what is it?
 - No, that's because

477
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:19,620
your wife blew her nose all into my handkerchief!

478
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:24,690
Forget it. You better be glad that we made up. What do you think would have happened if we didn't?

479
00:44:24,690 --> 00:44:28,500
Were you really trying to date my wife?

480
00:44:28,500 --> 00:44:31,160
Wow, I heard that you were a divorce lawyer.

481
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:33,470
But you're really a seduction lawyer!

482
00:44:33,470 --> 00:44:35,760
Hey, what are you saying?

483
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,220
If you keep acting like that, I can't hold back either!

484
00:44:38,220 --> 00:44:43,230
If you can't hold back, then what are you going to do? What are you going to do if you can't hold back?!

485
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,440
- Who are you?
 - I'm Lawyer Dan Moon Hui.

486
00:44:56,440 --> 00:44:59,960
It seems like you're misunderstanding something, but Lawyer Choi isn't that kind of person.

487
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:04,680
He's always been a warm and friendly person. He's not the kind of person to do something improper toward a client.

488
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,490
What do you know that you're butting in?

489
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:08,330
I know enough.

490
00:45:08,330 --> 00:45:10,280
So just leave now.

491
00:45:10,280 --> 00:45:13,940
Before I sue you for obstruction of work, vandalism,

492
00:45:13,940 --> 00:45:17,210
and committing an act of violence. You haven't forgotten that this is a law firm,

493
00:45:17,210 --> 00:45:19,450
have you?

494
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,310
Honey, let's just go.

495
00:45:21,310 --> 00:45:24,730
- Honey, don't let yourself be seduced.
 - Okay.

496
00:45:24,730 --> 00:45:27,150
- I'm scared.
 - Don't be scared.

497
00:45:27,150 --> 00:45:29,160
- I'm scared.
 - Don't be.

498
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:33,310
- Are you alright, Lawyer Dan?
 - Yes, I'm alright.

499
00:45:33,310 --> 00:45:35,170
I'm sorry.

500
00:45:35,800 --> 00:45:39,410
- So why did you step in and— 
- Today's your birthday.

501
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:43,220
I couldn't let you have a bad memory of your birthday.

502
00:45:43,220 --> 00:45:46,510
Think of it as a birthday present.

503
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:59,040
What is this? The only person who has defended me because they were worried I would get hurt

504
00:46:00,030 --> 00:46:02,270
is my mom.

505
00:46:11,650 --> 00:46:14,370
Let's go home. I'll take you.

506
00:46:14,370 --> 00:46:18,430
No, I have a dinner appointment today.

507
00:46:18,430 --> 00:46:20,570
With whom?

508
00:46:20,570 --> 00:46:25,320
I'm not sure. Do I have to tell you every little thing?

509
00:46:28,590 --> 00:46:32,460
Actually, I agreed to have dinner with my company CEO.

510
00:46:32,460 --> 00:46:37,000
He said that we should talk. I'll call you when the dinner is over.

511
00:46:53,670 --> 00:46:56,160
- Mr. CEO.
 - Hm?

512
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,260
Don't worry too much.

513
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:03,070
As we talk to him, his misconceptions about us will all clear up.

514
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:06,200
That's right, Yoon Seo. You're right.

515
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:12,650
Since our Yoon Seo has lived out in society for a little while, she even knows how to comfort me. You're all grown up.

516
00:47:14,630 --> 00:47:18,060
By the way, so much time has already gone by. Why is he taking so long to come?

517
00:47:20,950 --> 00:47:22,570
He's here.

518
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:48,760
Wait. How are you...?

519
00:47:48,760 --> 00:47:51,210
It's been a long time, CEO Yeon.

520
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:54,560
And Yoon Seo.

521
00:47:58,710 --> 00:48:01,420
You didn't wait long, did you?

522
00:48:01,420 --> 00:48:05,490
Let's see. What is it that Yoon Seo liked?

523
00:48:05,490 --> 00:48:09,560
What are you doing right now?

524
00:48:13,170 --> 00:48:15,590
Get up, Yoon Seo. Let's go.

525
00:48:15,590 --> 00:48:17,860
Are you saying

526
00:48:17,860 --> 00:48:20,870
- that you're going to give up the drama like this? 
- Yes.

527
00:48:20,870 --> 00:48:23,280
We will not be doing this drama.

528
00:48:23,280 --> 00:48:25,580
What are you doing? I said let's go.

529
00:48:29,030 --> 00:48:31,050
It seems that Oh Yoon Seo has a different thought on the matter.

530
00:48:31,050 --> 00:48:34,200
Sit down, Mr. CEO. I have something to say.

531
00:48:34,200 --> 00:48:36,090
Yoon Seo!

532
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:40,710
I definitely told you earlier

533
00:48:40,710 --> 00:48:42,500
that I hoped there would be no reason for me to see you again.

534
00:48:42,500 --> 00:48:44,570
I also told you earlier

535
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,060
that you became fearless during the time I didn't see you.

536
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:53,020
I had a lot to lose back then,

537
00:48:53,020 --> 00:48:55,700
but I don't have anything to lose now.

538
00:48:56,700 --> 00:48:58,100
You have nothing to lose? Oh Yoon Seo, who wanted to have a comeback drama so badly

539
00:48:58,100 --> 00:49:01,200
that she even went to work at a law firm?

540
00:49:01,210 --> 00:49:05,060
It seems that you're greatly misunderstanding something,

541
00:49:05,060 --> 00:49:08,070
but I don't need to do that drama.

542
00:49:08,070 --> 00:49:11,960
As you said, I'm more than happy enough right now.

543
00:49:23,580 --> 00:49:25,150
Yoon Seo!

544
00:49:44,730 --> 00:49:46,720
Don't get out.

545
00:49:50,430 --> 00:49:54,070
- Be safe on your way back.
 - Oh, okay. Head on in.

546
00:50:04,450 --> 00:50:07,430
What's with this atmosphere?

547
00:50:07,430 --> 00:50:11,120
Then are we really not doing the drama?

548
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:16,320
But Yoon Seo seems to be doing better than I thought.

549
00:50:16,320 --> 00:50:18,570
I know, right?

550
00:50:23,330 --> 00:50:26,610
We're not leaving? Why are you leaning your seat back too?

551
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:28,450
I'm sorry.

552
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:52,500
 Love Is a Painful Law 

553
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:28,360
 Your call cannot be connected. You will be connected to voicemail— 

554
00:51:37,300 --> 00:51:39,970
 I made it home safely. 

555
00:51:39,970 --> 00:51:42,560
 I'll see you tomorrow. 

556
00:51:42,560 --> 00:51:45,360
 Did something happen? 

557
00:51:52,730 --> 00:51:55,990
 Sleep well. I'll see you tomorrow. 

558
00:52:46,810 --> 00:52:51,720
 CEO Jeong Ji Ho, who was arrested and imprisoned for gambling illegally overseas, 

559
00:52:51,720 --> 00:52:55,260
 received a sentence of two years of imprisonment and three years of probation. 

560
00:52:55,260 --> 00:52:58,100
 While the criticism regarding the extremely light punishment continues, 

561
00:52:58,100 --> 00:53:00,430
 CEO Jeong admitted his crimes in front of the jury 

562
00:53:00,430 --> 00:53:02,440
 and seems to be reflecting deeply. 

563
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:04,700
Are you okay?

564
00:53:04,700 --> 00:53:08,270
Do you think I would be? Do you want to have a glass of soju?

565
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:16,570
That guy Jeong Ji Ho didn't only gamble illegally overseas.

566
00:53:16,570 --> 00:53:18,970
The money that he embezzled amounts to over 20 billion.

567
00:53:18,970 --> 00:53:22,580
Just thinking about the fact that a guy like that can return to society and sleep comfortably...

568
00:53:26,990 --> 00:53:28,800
Can you let things go like this?

569
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:31,180
I have to let it go.

570
00:53:31,180 --> 00:53:32,970
For now.

571
00:53:33,430 --> 00:53:35,230
For now?

572
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:42,580
By the way, why have you been looking like that since earlier?

573
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,860
Can you tell me everything you know about Lee Kang Joon?

574
00:53:55,860 --> 00:53:59,780
Don't tell me. Did he come looking for Yoon Seo?

575
00:54:02,050 --> 00:54:06,060
And he also even had someone tailing her.

576
00:54:06,060 --> 00:54:07,580
What?

577
00:54:08,450 --> 00:54:12,220
I have a memory card of pictures taken without her knowledge as a piece of evidence, but...

578
00:54:12,220 --> 00:54:13,700
But?

579
00:54:13,700 --> 00:54:16,790
- It seems like she doesn't want to make a big deal of the issue yet.
 - Goodness.

580
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:19,120
Of course she wouldn't

581
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:23,320
since the incident that the whole nation was talking about has just now quieted down.

582
00:54:24,660 --> 00:54:27,880
There's nothing that I can do,

583
00:54:27,880 --> 00:54:30,120
so I'm really frustrated.

584
00:54:30,120 --> 00:54:34,320
Anyway, I'll look into some details about him.

585
00:54:46,620 --> 00:54:49,840
  Mr. Lawyer, you're a hedeghog.  

586
00:54:51,340 --> 00:54:53,230
Why aren't you coming?

587
00:54:55,730 --> 00:54:59,130
Go home yourself. I have somewhere to go.

588
00:55:18,620 --> 00:55:21,930
- Who are you? 
 - I am the hedgehog.

589
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:23,450
What?

590
00:55:34,620 --> 00:55:36,880
Do you like it?

591
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:39,420
I can't always be by your side,

592
00:55:39,420 --> 00:55:43,150
so I brought him because I thought it would be nice if at least he was by your side.

593
00:55:47,280 --> 00:55:51,000
Yes, I  really  like it.

594
00:55:52,430 --> 00:55:56,820
But, you don't look very happy.

595
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:58,980
Mr. Lawyer,

596
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,620
I may not be able

597
00:56:02,620 --> 00:56:05,750
to go to the law firm for a while.

598
00:56:07,720 --> 00:56:11,470
So that I can fill in the entire three months that I promised,

599
00:56:11,470 --> 00:56:14,380
and so that I can

600
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:17,220
finish the work that I was assigned properly,

601
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,750
I will work my hardest.

602
00:56:19,750 --> 00:56:21,970
But,

603
00:56:21,970 --> 00:56:26,040
for right now,

604
00:56:26,040 --> 00:56:28,710
I think it will be a little difficult

605
00:56:29,840 --> 00:56:32,230
for my heart.

606
00:56:32,230 --> 00:56:34,300
Is something wrong?

607
00:56:34,300 --> 00:56:36,410
Why, all of a sudden?

608
00:56:37,910 --> 00:56:40,110
I'm sorry.

609
00:56:40,860 --> 00:56:45,480
Right now, I can't tell you anything.

610
00:56:55,840 --> 00:56:58,380
You said that Yoon Seo's drama has been canceled?

611
00:56:58,380 --> 00:57:02,160
Ah, Hyung! Use your inside voice! Your inside voice.

612
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,710
I'm sorry. It's so shocking that I did it without realizing it.

613
00:57:06,710 --> 00:57:10,340
She must be so heartbroken. What can we do?

614
00:57:11,550 --> 00:57:14,290
That's what I'm saying. Our Yoon Seo...

615
00:57:14,290 --> 00:57:18,610
The members of Yoon Seo's fan cafe will be so heartbroken.

616
00:57:18,610 --> 00:57:22,260
They were waiting so eagerly for Yoon Seo to make a comeback through Writer Lee Sae Jin's drama.

617
00:57:22,260 --> 00:57:24,260
With Yoon Seos' existing videos,

618
00:57:24,300 --> 00:57:27,900
GIF of her smiling and GIFs of her winking,

619
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,800
they've been holding out. How heartbroken do you think they'll be when they hear this news?

620
00:57:30,820 --> 00:57:35,110
Hyung! They still make GIFs like that in the fan cafes?

621
00:57:35,900 --> 00:57:38,540
You told me to use my inside voice.

622
00:57:38,540 --> 00:57:40,810
I'm one of the founding members of Oh Yoon Seo's fan cafe.

623
00:57:40,810 --> 00:57:44,820
The fact that I'm acting as the faceless vice president is a secret that only you know.

624
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,160
You wouldn't know

625
00:57:46,160 --> 00:57:49,950
how happy it makes you feel to stand behind someone and support them like Daddy Long Legs.

626
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:52,070
Hyung. Hyung!

627
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:55,070
Hyung, you have a skill at making people feel displeased!

628
00:57:55,070 --> 00:57:58,290
- Is that the problem right now?
- So what I'm saying

629
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:02,980
is that there are a lot of people who are waiting for Yoon Seo to make a comeback to that extent.

630
00:58:02,980 --> 00:58:05,730
What should our Yoon Seo do?

631
00:58:05,730 --> 00:58:08,590
It's obvious that she's gradually gotten used to the lifestyle of the law firm.

632
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,400
Doesn't this all become a useless effort since this happened?

633
00:58:11,400 --> 00:58:14,430
That's why I came to tell you

634
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:18,030
- that Yoon Seo can't come starting today.
 - Alright, then.

635
00:58:18,030 --> 00:58:21,520
But because people don't know the inside story, they will  be full of curiosity.

636
00:58:21,520 --> 00:58:24,210
- So what should I tell them?
 - Well, just, well...

637
00:58:24,210 --> 00:58:26,400
Just tell them that she's sick.

638
00:58:26,400 --> 00:58:30,060
I'll think about the rest over time.

639
00:58:32,210 --> 00:58:34,700
- Did you eat garlic?
 - Yeah.

640
00:58:34,700 --> 00:58:37,040
Wow, it's really... Man.

641
00:58:44,100 --> 00:58:46,320
What is it that you have to tell us?

642
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:48,540
Is it some important announcement?

643
00:58:48,540 --> 00:58:51,350
Well, it's not a crucial announcement. It's just a notice.

644
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:53,070
Yoon Seo

645
00:58:53,070 --> 00:58:56,810
is a little sick. So I think she'll be resting for a few days.

646
00:58:58,420 --> 00:59:00,100
Where and how much is she hurting?

647
00:59:00,100 --> 00:59:02,540
Then, how long will she be out?

648
00:59:02,540 --> 00:59:05,040
I'm not sure. Thats... Hm...

649
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:08,430
We'll have to watch the situation over time. Anyway, just keep that in mind.

650
00:59:08,430 --> 00:59:11,820
Yoon Seo's absence will be noticed, so Secretary Yang and the interns

651
00:59:11,820 --> 00:59:14,830
- should help Lawyer Kwon whenever you can.
 - Yes, sir.

652
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:16,260
- Yes, sir.
 - Yes sir.
 - Okay.

653
00:59:16,260 --> 00:59:18,230
Let's get back to work.

654
00:59:32,530 --> 00:59:36,220
Lawyer Kwon, this is the client I told you about earlier.

655
00:59:36,250 --> 00:59:39,520
Well, he was originally assigned to Lawyer Dan,

656
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:42,680
but he said that he can't work with her because they're not compatible.

657
00:59:42,690 --> 00:59:45,360
- It's an overseas gambling case.
 - Okay.

658
00:59:45,360 --> 00:59:47,810
He's here now. I'll bring him here.

659
00:59:47,810 --> 00:59:49,710
Okay, I understand.

660
00:59:57,650 --> 01:00:02,680
First, you need to write a letter of reflection to submit to the jury.

661
01:00:02,680 --> 01:00:07,570
You have to include that you're reflecting on it and that you will never gamble again.

662
01:00:07,610 --> 01:00:11,250
And visit a psychiatrist or a psychological counseling center and have a consultation.

663
01:00:11,290 --> 01:00:14,840
You should submit his consultation record or his report.

664
01:00:14,880 --> 01:00:17,800
If I do that, then will I be able to avoid getting imprisoned?

665
01:00:18,620 --> 01:00:22,990
I can't guarantee that, but since you don't have a prior conviction, have a good consulting session and

666
01:00:23,030 --> 01:00:27,190
as long as it's clear that it's not habitual, I think that you can avoid imprisonment.

667
01:00:29,610 --> 01:00:32,790
You need to know that it's ending at this level because the amount that you gambled was small.

668
01:00:32,790 --> 01:00:36,390
You'd know this from the news, but if you gamble hundreds of millions of dollars like Jeong Ji Ho,

669
01:00:36,390 --> 01:00:38,200
then you will definitely have to be imprisoned.

670
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:42,800
Jeong Ji Ho? But I found his case a little weird.

671
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,780
What do you mean, weird?

672
01:00:44,780 --> 01:00:49,010
This is just a rumor amongst the gambling pros, but

673
01:00:49,010 --> 01:00:53,770
they say that CEO Jeong Ji Ho has never gambled to begin with.

674
01:00:54,400 --> 01:00:56,310
What? What do you mean?

675
01:00:56,310 --> 01:01:01,870
The NCT Hotel in Macau that he supposedly gambled at

676
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:04,990
is my go-to casino.

677
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:10,920
A hyungnim that a friend of mine knows is on the security team for the VIP room.

678
01:01:10,920 --> 01:01:15,650
But he said he only saw Jeong Ji Ho exactly once at the casino, on the day that he was arrested for gambling.

679
01:01:15,690 --> 01:01:21,720
But interestingly on the news, it was reported that Jeong Ji Ho had habitually gambled at that casino.

680
01:01:21,720 --> 01:01:26,640
It's like saying, "I didn't drink but I drove drunk."

681
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:29,760
Isn't it?

682
01:01:53,950 --> 01:01:56,280
Did you ask for me?

683
01:01:56,280 --> 01:01:59,830
That's... Section Chief.

684
01:01:59,850 --> 01:02:02,810
Can you please look up Lawyer Choi Yoon Soo's bank account history?

685
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:05,540
Excuse me? Lawyer Choi Yoon Soo is...

686
01:02:05,540 --> 01:02:09,840
Yes. He's Jeong Ji Ho's defense lawyer but there's something that feels weird.

687
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:12,720
Ah, but, Mr. Prosecutor...

688
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,880
Section Chief, I don't think I can leave things this way.

689
01:02:16,710 --> 01:02:19,200
I'll take full responsibility for everything.

690
01:02:21,080 --> 01:02:23,580
Okay, for now.

691
01:02:26,980 --> 01:02:29,160
Kwon Jeong Rok.

692
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,360
Lee Kang Joon had a lot of problems when he was in a branch abroad, too.

693
01:02:37,360 --> 01:02:39,430
Of course, even then, he tried to resolve everything with money.

694
01:02:39,430 --> 01:02:41,740
Oh right. Regarding Jeong Ji Ho.

695
01:02:43,540 --> 01:02:48,060
It's not confirmed but there is a rumor that he actually did not gamble.

696
01:02:48,060 --> 01:02:50,270
What do you mean?

697
01:02:50,310 --> 01:02:53,380
I may not know much about anything else but I'm sure there was enough evidence.

698
01:02:53,380 --> 01:02:57,720
We confirmed his entries and departures into Macao and we have a photo of him at the hotel casino.

699
01:02:59,560 --> 01:03:02,090
Ah. It's right here.

700
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,930
 Who are you? 

701
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:17,400
Why are you like that?

702
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:22,750
That person is the person that Lee Kang Joon ordered to follow Oh Jin Sim.

703
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:25,940
Where is the branch abroad that you said Lee Kang Joon was?

704
01:03:25,940 --> 01:03:27,930
Macau.

705
01:03:30,750 --> 01:03:35,220
Looking at it now, they have the same lawyer, Choi Yeon Soo.

706
01:03:35,220 --> 01:03:40,870
Two years ago, he was Lee Kang Joon's lawyer during the drug scandal and now he's Jeong Ji Ho's lawyer.

707
01:03:58,600 --> 01:04:02,470
  Yoon Seo, I heard you were sick. How are you feeling?  

708
01:04:41,880 --> 01:04:43,920
Yoon Seo.

709
01:04:43,980 --> 01:04:47,020
I heard you were feeling sick. How did you come in today?

710
01:04:47,020 --> 01:04:51,740
I didn't come to work today.

711
01:04:52,990 --> 01:04:57,820
Today, I came as a client.

712
01:04:57,820 --> 01:05:01,100
Lawyer Kwon is inside, right?

713
01:05:18,440 --> 01:05:22,250
Lee Kang Joon...

714
01:05:23,970 --> 01:05:27,390
I want to sue him.

715
01:05:38,920 --> 01:05:42,140
These are the various threatening texts and photos that he sent.

716
01:05:42,140 --> 01:05:46,020
I didn't throw them away and kept them instead.

717
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:49,620
Will these be enough evidence?

718
01:05:49,620 --> 01:05:52,310
Of course.

719
01:05:52,310 --> 01:05:57,370
This time, please make him receive his punishment.

720
01:05:57,410 --> 01:06:01,600
Of course. I will definitely make that happen.

721
01:06:15,280 --> 01:06:18,400
Thanks for dropping me off.

722
01:06:20,030 --> 01:06:24,040
Are you really okay?

723
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:27,540
Yes. I'm okay.

724
01:06:27,540 --> 01:06:35,250
Actually, it was so scary and disturbing that I didn't have the courage to reflect back on the incident.

725
01:06:35,250 --> 01:06:39,890
But, to leave it buried as though I'm okay and have forgotten about the incident

726
01:06:39,890 --> 01:06:43,520
didn't help ease the pain.

727
01:06:45,760 --> 01:06:49,340
So, I'll try to be courageous

728
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:51,990
while trusting my lawyer.

729
01:06:53,670 --> 01:06:57,670
Yes. Just trust me from now on.

730
01:07:10,640 --> 01:07:13,210
You came?

731
01:07:18,770 --> 01:07:21,670
I came because I wanted to see you.

732
01:07:54,440 --> 01:07:57,230
I love you, Yoon Seo.

733
01:07:58,230 --> 01:08:01,120
You still love me too.

734
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:07,200
In order to gain my attention, you're acting like you're mad.

735
01:08:07,200 --> 01:08:10,410
That's also why you're acting like you like that man.

736
01:08:11,250 --> 01:08:12,770
To provoke me.

737
01:08:12,770 --> 01:08:14,520
Don't come here.

738
01:08:15,320 --> 01:08:18,440
If you come any closer,

739
01:08:18,440 --> 01:08:20,740
I will call the police.

740
01:08:20,740 --> 01:08:22,880
Call the police?

741
01:08:29,270 --> 01:08:35,640
You clearly still don't know me that well.

742
01:08:47,790 --> 01:08:51,010
Tell me truthfully that you love me!

743
01:08:51,010 --> 01:08:54,730
Tell me that I'm the only one for you, right now!

744
01:09:16,410 --> 01:09:19,830
Don't lay a finger on my woman.

01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:05,400
 I would like for you, Oh Yoon Seo, to play the main female character of this project. 

755
01:10:05,400 --> 01:10:07,200
 Is Yoon Seo going to return to the entertainment industry? 

756
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:09,680
 Since she got a job as a law firm secretary because she was interested in this area, 

757
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:11,300
 wouldn't she continue to work in the law industry? 

758
01:10:11,300 --> 01:10:13,900
 The people at your law firm will be extremely surprised. 

759
01:10:13,900 --> 01:10:16,670
 - It's said that you'll be playing as a lawyer. Is this true?
  - How is it that even Lawyer Kwon...  

760
01:10:16,670 --> 01:10:19,950
 I don't need anything else except for the place by your side. 

761
01:10:19,950 --> 01:10:22,760
 What should I do with you, a woman who can 

762
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:25,190
 embrace my rose-like self like this vase? 

763
01:10:25,190 --> 01:10:27,600
 There is no way the two of them are dating. Ever! 

764
01:10:27,600 --> 01:10:28,630
- What should I do? 
 - You know something!

765
01:10:28,630 --> 01:10:30,850
 - You know something right?! 
 - I probably don't know anything. 

766
01:10:30,890 --> 01:10:35,590
 I know it might sound trite, but I wish that you would break up with Yoon Seo for her sake. 

767
01:10:35,590 --> 01:10:40,120
 Is my love for Oh Jin Sim putting her in a difficult situation?
