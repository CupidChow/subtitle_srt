1
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:09,630


2
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,460
 Touch Your Heart 

3
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:44,510
What is it that you wanted to tell me?
  Episode 8 

4
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:48,140
- Yoon Seo, you're having a really tough time, aren't you?
 - What?

5
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:50,050
It's alright for you to cry.

6
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:53,510
Cry as much as you want and wipe your tears with this.

7
00:00:54,460 --> 00:00:56,950
Yoon Seo, you foolish person.

8
00:00:56,950 --> 00:01:00,370
If you were having such a difficult time, you really should have told me.

9
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:05,060
What do you mean, tears?

10
00:01:05,060 --> 00:01:08,010
And I'm foolish? What are you saying?

11
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,820
I heard from Joon Seok that Lawyer Kwon has been really hard on you all this time.

12
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:16,740
He spoke harshly to you, spoke rashly, and even made you work overtime. Even when you took a day off work a few days ago,

13
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:20,380
I heard that it was because you kept trying to endure Lawyer Kwon's tyranny, but ultimately were unable to.

14
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,720
What do you mean?

15
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,250
With how I'm feeling, I wish I could fire Lawyer Kwon right now.

16
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:30,370
But, even though his personality is like it is, he's pretty skilled.

17
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,010
And there are a lot of trials going on right now.

18
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,160
So, that's why I'm saying this,

19
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:38,860
but what do you think about moving to Lawyer Choi's office for the rest of your time here?

20
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:41,870
- I don't want to!
 - What?

21
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:44,050
Lawyer Kwon has never bullied me.

22
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:47,760
And taking the day off work was because of personal reasons.

23
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:50,080
It's not Lawyer Kwon's fault.

24
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:52,290
That's all a misunderstanding. It's a misunderstanding.

25
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,620
But why did you say you were going to destroy Lawyer Kwon

26
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:57,500
- and send him to hell?
- Oh, my.

27
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:01,420
- The CEO even told you that?
 - Yeah.

28
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:04,240
Oh, that was just in the beginning.

29
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,030
I don't have any problems whatsoever now.

30
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,770
He teaches me a lot and is considerate of me. I'm so thankful to him.

31
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:14,060
Then from now on, you'll continue being Lawyer Kwon's secretary?

32
00:02:14,060 --> 00:02:16,180
- Of course!
 - Aigo.

33
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,170
That's a relief. Such a relief. That's such a relief. You don't know how worried I was

34
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:22,110
that you would take him on the road to hell yourself.

35
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,230
Yes, well.

36
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:27,470
That's a relief.

37
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:32,990
Why did the CEO say something so unnecessary?

38
00:02:38,410 --> 00:02:42,750
My life without Lawyer Kwon is hell now, you know.

39
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:47,950
Wait. He doesn't have anything scheduled in the evening today.

40
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,280
Shall I ask him out on a date?

41
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,860
Restaurant.

42
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:01,690
This is making things difficut.

43
00:03:01,690 --> 00:03:03,890
 Restaurants that are good for dates 

44
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:08,020
One without people

45
00:03:08,020 --> 00:03:11,200
and private. Mm-hm.

46
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:14,890
Let's see.

47
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,480
Wow, it's pretty.

48
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,160
Then, I'll get in touch with you again.

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,640
- Alright, please head back.
 - Alright.

50
00:03:37,460 --> 00:03:40,430
- How are you feeling? Are you okay?
 - Yeah.

51
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:43,600
Thanks to you.

52
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,390
Thanks for taking me to the ER that day.

53
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:50,300
Don't mention it.

54
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:56,320
Then take care of yourself.

55
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,710
Kwon Jeong Rok!

56
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:07,930
Isn't it wrong for us to keep being like this?

57
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:10,320
Let's have a glass of beer this evening.

58
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,820
 One Star That I Love 

59
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:21,910
I'm back.

60
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,430
- You're here?
 - Mr. Lawyer.

61
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:30,770
Mr. Lawyer, do you have a star that you love kept in your heart, as well?

62
00:04:30,770 --> 00:04:32,630
Yes, well.

63
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:43,210
A star...

64
00:04:43,210 --> 00:04:44,890
Hello.

65
00:04:44,890 --> 00:04:47,580
You're here? How did the trial go?

66
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,920
I won the case.

67
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,660
That's good.

68
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:55,480
- This evening—
- Ah!

69
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:59,520
I was planning on telling you anyway. I think I'll have  to have a glass of alcohol this evening.

70
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:01,430
Even alcohol? Sounds good!

71
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:03,790
- What?
 - What?

72
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,090
- What?
 - What?

73
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:09,960
I was telling you that I would be having a glass of alcohol with Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum.

74
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,610
With Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum?

75
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:16,880
Yes. We clashed with each other pretty badly because of the Im Yoon Hui case, did we not?

76
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:19,980
And in the end, it's true that I made things difficult for Yeo Reum.

77
00:05:19,980 --> 00:05:24,590
We thought that it wasn't right for us to continue not seeing each other, and there are a lot of things that we need to resolve at this time.

78
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:29,300
Do you possibly... dislike that?

79
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,230
What do you mean, dislike it? What's the big deal about friends having a drink together?

80
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,190
I knew that you would say that.

81
00:05:38,190 --> 00:05:40,940
What about the judicial precedent that you were going to find?

82
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,180
- It's right here. Right here.
 - Alright.

83
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,010
  Lovely: One Table Restaurant 
 Your reservation is complete!  

84
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:50,390
Do you have plans today?

85
00:05:50,390 --> 00:05:52,480
Well...

86
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:54,130
Who are you going with?

87
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:56,060
That's...

88
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:00,840
With Lawyer Dan.

89
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,690
I made reservations to go with Lawyer Dan.

90
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:05,120
Are you two close?

91
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:10,300
Of course. We're really, really close. We even talk to each other about our problems.

92
00:06:12,220 --> 00:06:14,650
It's nice to see that you're close with someone at the law firm.

93
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:17,100
I will also support your friendship with her.

94
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,610
Then.

95
00:06:35,350 --> 00:06:38,790
This is my first time coming to a place like this. It's so nice!

96
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:43,580
It's my first time coming, too.

97
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,530
It  is  nice.

98
00:06:45,530 --> 00:06:51,580
But did you really make a reservation to eat here with me?

99
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:53,390
Just looking at it, it's a place for a date.

100
00:06:53,390 --> 00:06:55,900
What do you mean, a place for a date?

101
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:00,120
I really did make a reservation to eat here with you.

102
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,150
This is the romantic couple course. Have a good time.

103
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:14,660
Not only did you come to a place like this with me,

104
00:07:14,660 --> 00:07:17,360
you even reserved a romantic couple dinner course.

105
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:19,980
Yoon Seo...

106
00:07:21,050 --> 00:07:23,070
You must want to date!

107
00:07:23,070 --> 00:07:25,980
You need to hurry up and get a boyfriend!

108
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:27,960
Yes, well...

109
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,000
I'm sorry for being so small-minded all that time.

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,590
Actually, I wanted to do well on this case and get moved to a special department.

111
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,750
I think that I ended up thinking of this case as a ticket to that special department at some point.

112
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,160
Because my heart was in the wrong place, I ended up missing what was important.

113
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:51,190
I reflected on myself.

114
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:52,960
I was also mean to you.

115
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:58,360
Forget it. I was also sorry for suddenly putting an additional witness on the stand at the trial.

116
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:01,940
Right? You felt bad, didn't you?

117
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,650
You're really too much. How could you stab me in the back like that?

118
00:08:05,650 --> 00:08:09,990
How could you reveal the true criminal there, you spiteful guy?

119
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:14,170
Yoon Seo, you took a day off a little while ago.

120
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:17,080
Did something happen?

121
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:19,490
I just wasn't feeling too well.

122
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:25,640
Ah, I see. I thought that you'd gotten into a fight with Lawyer Kwon again.

123
00:08:25,640 --> 00:08:28,390
Well, what is there for me and Lawyer Kwon to fight about?

124
00:08:28,390 --> 00:08:32,690
It seemed that there was a lot for you to fight about. Mr. Lawyer has an extremely prickly personality.

125
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:36,210
Honestly, when I saw him conducting the trial for Im Yoon Hui,

126
00:08:36,210 --> 00:08:39,020
I was kind of surprised.

127
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:41,940
I've always known that Lawyer Kwon is cold-hearted,

128
00:08:41,940 --> 00:08:45,990
but I didn't knoq that he'd be like that even toward Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum.

129
00:08:45,990 --> 00:08:49,100
- How could he screw his first love over?
 - Hm?

130
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:53,750
His first love, you said?

131
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:57,500
You wouldn't know, Yoon Seo.

132
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:01,860
It's a secret, but actually, but one of my classmates from law school

133
00:09:01,860 --> 00:09:05,310
heard it from one of Lawyer Kwon's juniors at his school.

134
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:08,040
She said that he liked Yoo Yeo Reum.

135
00:09:12,070 --> 00:09:15,540
Did those two date?

136
00:09:16,810 --> 00:09:21,670
That's not it. Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum went out with Prosecutor Kim Se Won.

137
00:09:21,670 --> 00:09:24,980
- Who is Prosecutor Kim Se Won?
 - That...

138
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:30,500
Alright. This is Kwon Jeong Rok, this is Yoo Yeo Reum, and this is Kim Se Won.

139
00:09:30,500 --> 00:09:32,580
These three were really close friends,

140
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:36,070
and Kwon Jeong Rok liked Yoo Yeo Reum, while Yoo Yeo Reum liked Kim Se Won.

141
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,020
And then, these two dated.

142
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:42,350
So they say that Lawyer Kwon's love just ended as a painful one-sided love.

143
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,710
 - Don't be like that. Let's have a meal together sometime.
 - Whenever is fine with me. 

144
00:09:46,710 --> 00:09:49,080
 My heart was almost touched. 

145
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:53,340
 If you have time, shall we eat together? What about pasta? 

146
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:58,900
 I'm sorry, but will you head back first? 

147
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:01,600
 So he liked her? 

148
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,330
 So that's why, like that... 

149
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:06,680
But, this is just my personal thought.

150
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,770
I think that Lawyer Kwon

151
00:10:09,630 --> 00:10:12,950
has lingering feelings for Yoo Yeo Reum.

152
00:10:12,950 --> 00:10:16,140
His gaze when he looks at Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum

153
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:18,710
is unusual.

154
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:27,920
Yoo-Yoon Seo, why are you doing that?

155
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,230
Well, because the macaroon is too small.

156
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:38,430
Shouldn't it at least be as big as the palm of my hand?

157
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,640
Ah, I'm pissed off, seriously!

158
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,280
Here. Eat all of them, Yoon Seo.

159
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,120
I won't eat this one.

160
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,210
Yes, Oh Jin Sim.

161
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,600
I was already planning on calling you when I got home.

162
00:10:56,600 --> 00:10:59,840
 Mr. Lawyer, could you come see me right now? 

163
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,910
What? Right now?

164
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:06,140
 Yes. I have something I have to tell you, right now at this moment. 

165
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,000
 I'll go to you. Where are you? 

166
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,560
I'm near my house.

167
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:15,820
Then, I'll send you my address.

168
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,510
Is something wrong? You came all the way here.

169
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:27,150
I could have gone to you.

170
00:11:27,150 --> 00:11:29,280
Mr. Lawyer,

171
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:33,920
I heard that you liked Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum.

172
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:39,050
I heard that you were in a love triangle with her and your close friend. Is that true?

173
00:11:39,050 --> 00:11:42,050
Yes, it's true.

174
00:11:42,050 --> 00:11:45,230
What are you so confident about?

175
00:11:45,230 --> 00:11:49,240
Then, should I be embarrassed about it? It's already in the past.

176
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:51,880
But still, even if it is something in the past,

177
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:55,430
you drank with a woman that you liked so much a long time ago, just the two of you.

178
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:58,320
Doing that's a little strange!

179
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,540
What kind of girlfriend would like or be understanding of that?

180
00:12:01,540 --> 00:12:03,340
But, we're just friends now.

181
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:06,340
That's what you think!

182
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:08,770
If you're still being good to her

183
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:11,790
and keep meeting up with her alone,

184
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,830
then other people who see you

185
00:12:14,830 --> 00:12:18,080
could think that you still have feelings for her.

186
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,560
 Kwon Jeong Rok! 

187
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:25,000
What are you doing here?

188
00:12:27,890 --> 00:12:29,820
Who is this?

189
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:35,060
Are you perhaps Jeong Rok's girlfriend?

190
00:12:35,740 --> 00:12:38,080
Yes.  How are you?

191
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:43,200
Oh, hello. I am his roommate, Kim Se Won.

192
00:12:44,150 --> 00:12:46,690
- Kim Se Won? 
 -  This is a real pleasure.

193
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,340
I really wanted to meet Jeong Rok's girlfriend.

194
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:54,600
Don't go home like that.  Let's go in together and order some chicken and beer together.

195
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:55,860
That's ...

196
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,460
Next time, next time.  I'll set up a dinner for you next time.

197
00:12:58,460 --> 00:13:02,470
Why would you set up a dinner for next time?  This is something you can do right now.

198
00:13:02,470 --> 00:13:06,810
Don't make it complicated.  Relax and let's have some beer.

199
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:09,440
Come on,  quickly.

200
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:11,830
- She's busy and ... 
  - Come on, come on.

201
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:16,040
Come with me.  Come on.

202
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:18,840
Hurry and come.

203
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,650
Here,  the chicken came.  This way.

204
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:37,210
-  This way.  
 - Hurry and grab a seat.

205
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,550
Ah...

206
00:13:40,550 --> 00:13:44,250
Although I didn't set the table, please  help yourself.

207
00:13:44,250 --> 00:13:45,320
Yes.

208
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:50,320
Anyway, I'm so glad to meet you.  Every time he talked about you, I was really curious as to what kind of person you were.

209
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,440
He told you about me?  Mr. Lawyer?

210
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:57,800
Of course. You and he went to a company dinner together a while back, right?

211
00:13:57,800 --> 00:14:01,990
You also went to the movies. After seeing the movie, he  had the ticket like this.

212
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:05,260
He was looking at the ticket like this and that's when I sensed it.

213
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:07,900
Oh, this is love.

214
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:11,720
- Love has come. 
 -  Just eat the chicken and be quiet.

215
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:17,300
Why?  Are you feeling bashful? Shy?  Embarrassed?

216
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:22,320
But, don't you feel stuffy?

217
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,500
Why do you have to wear sunglasses indoors?

218
00:14:25,210 --> 00:14:26,970
Oh, that is ...

219
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:33,280
Well, since I'll be seeing you often in the future, then ...

220
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,180
Wow.

221
00:14:39,850 --> 00:14:43,420
You look a lot like Oh Yoon Seo.

222
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:50,290
I am Oh Yoon Seo.

223
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,920
Really? You're really that Oh Yoon Seo?

224
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:57,920
My goddess, your goddess, the universe's goddess?

225
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,140
You know the slogan, too?

226
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:02,160
Of course, Yoon Seo was so famous.

227
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:04,660
If you just turned on the television, a commercial she made came on.

228
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:09,960
Yeah.  Yeah.  Didn't you do the advertising for this chicken before?

229
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:13,260
"Morakana chicken  is here."

230
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:16,640
"The really sweet chicken is here."

231
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:19,960
"Mora, mora, morakana."

232
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:24,370
"Morakana chicken is here."

233
00:15:25,290 --> 00:15:26,920
Wow, daebak!

234
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,520
Wow! Daebak!

235
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:34,680
Wait, but I thought that Jeong Rok was dating his secretary.

236
00:15:35,450 --> 00:15:39,460
If that's so, don't tell me you are the person who is his secretary?

237
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:43,370
Ah.  That is ...  so ...

238
00:15:43,370 --> 00:15:47,200
Because of a situation, I'm working for only three months.

239
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:50,150
Oh, I see.

240
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:53,620
Hey, Man.  If you were dating the universe's goddess Yoon Seo,

241
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,820
you should have lived showing her how undeserving you are!

242
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:59,460
Why the heck did you get her upset, huh?

243
00:15:59,460 --> 00:16:02,320
How do you know ...

244
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:06,490
Actually, you two seemed so unusual before.

245
00:16:06,490 --> 00:16:11,330
Considering both of you, I wanted to get involved.  He's such an idiot at romance.

246
00:16:11,330 --> 00:16:15,230
Yoon Seo, what exactly did our boy do wrong?

247
00:16:15,230 --> 00:16:18,860
- But...
 - No, no, please speak freely.

248
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:23,130
It sounded like earlier that you said that there was some lingering attachment or regret.. something along those lines.

249
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:29,150
She said that she found out that I liked Yeo Reum before, and that the three of us used to be in a love triangle.

250
00:16:29,150 --> 00:16:32,350
Oh, I thought it was something serious.

251
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:35,990
If that's the issue, you have no need to worry!

252
00:16:35,990 --> 00:16:39,530
It was just a light interest when they were in college. That's not even something you can call love.

253
00:16:39,530 --> 00:16:42,820
It was a very very small amount of interest.

254
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,470
If that was super serious, the two of us would have become enemies.

255
00:16:45,470 --> 00:16:48,720
How would we be able to maintain such a good relationship together and even be roommates? Agree?

256
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,300
- Well, I guess that's true, but... 
 - And from what I can see,

257
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:56,660
only you have been able to enter Jeong Rok's heart, Oh Yoon Seo.

258
00:16:56,660 --> 00:17:01,010
I've never seen him open his heart this much to anyone before.

259
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:05,150
- Oh really?? 
 - That's what I'm saying.

260
00:17:09,350 --> 00:17:11,570
So, please don't misunderstand him uselessly.

261
00:17:11,570 --> 00:17:17,260
And please, take good care of him, although he is lacking and prickly.

262
00:17:17,260 --> 00:17:19,050
What do you mean I'm prickly?

263
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:23,430
Do you really not know? I'll spill all the beans to Oh Yoon Seo.

264
00:17:23,430 --> 00:17:28,580
During college, I forgot to do some homework for my class so I asked him to show me his,

265
00:17:28,580 --> 00:17:31,020
and this guy said "There is NO way I can lend you mine, so do your own work

266
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:36,000
but if you really need to copy mine, pay me 500 won per page."

267
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:40,400
But, that's still better than what I had to go through.

268
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,790
The first day I started working as his secretary, I cleaned Lawyer Kwon's desk and whoa.

269
00:17:44,790 --> 00:17:46,950
He got so angry and cold, saying things like

270
00:17:46,950 --> 00:17:51,020
"Why do you touch other people's belongings without permission".

271
00:17:51,020 --> 00:17:53,760
He made me feel really bad.

272
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:56,190
Ah, I can imagine without even seeing it.

273
00:17:58,350 --> 00:18:02,370
"Why do you touch other people's stuff without permission?" Was he like that?

274
00:18:02,370 --> 00:18:04,320
No no.

275
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,920
He frowned even more and said,

276
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:11,360
"WHY DO YOU TOUCH OTHER PEOPLE'S STUFF WITHOUT PERMISSION?" like that.

277
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:13,950
- Oh even more? Frowning more like this?
 - Yes!

278
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:18,390
"Why do you touch other people's stuff without permission?"

279
00:18:18,390 --> 00:18:21,600
- Yeah like that! 
 - When was I ever that severe?

280
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:24,830
I just said "Why do you touch other people's stuff without permission?"

281
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:27,530
- nicely. 
 - Huh?

282
00:18:27,530 --> 00:18:29,230
I think you're still misunderstanding me.

283
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:31,400
When did I say, "Why do you touch other people's stuff without permission?" angrily?

284
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:33,590
- Yeah, he did it like that! 
 - See, I'm right!

285
00:18:33,590 --> 00:18:36,290
You remember now, right?

286
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:45,140
Prosecutor Kim Se Won seems like a really fun person.

287
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:49,920
Yeah, he's a pretty cheerful, fun person. So he always was popular with the girls.

288
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:56,030
Oh, so that's why you lost Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum to him!

289
00:18:57,460 --> 00:19:01,480
Oh, I'm just kidding, it's a joke.

290
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,030
Are you feeling better now?

291
00:19:07,030 --> 00:19:09,700
Ah well,

292
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,670
when I first heard that you liked her, I was really jealous.

293
00:19:14,670 --> 00:19:20,080
But now, like you said, it's all in the past.

294
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,750
And also,

295
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:27,230
as Prosecutor Kim Se Won said,

296
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:30,630
I'm the only one in your heart.

297
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:36,430
Thank you for thinking like that.

298
00:19:36,430 --> 00:19:40,500
I honestly think that jealousy is the most useless emotion.

299
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:45,240
As long as we are true to our hearts, the past is insignificant.

300
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:50,360
Let's not waste our energy dwelling on the past, and instead, let's focus on the present.

301
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:59,000
Oh you're back, you thief?

302
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,460
Huh? Thief?

303
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:03,690
You're our country's third biggest thief.

304
00:20:03,690 --> 00:20:09,540
1) Rice thief, the marinated crab, 2) Rain, who married Kim Tae Hee, and 3) You, who are dating Oh Yoon Seo.

305
00:20:09,540 --> 00:20:11,840
You better behave properly in the future.

306
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:15,250
If it's Oh Yoon Seo, you're going to have a lot of competition.

307
00:20:15,250 --> 00:20:17,950
If you don't want to lose her, treat her well!

308
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:24,750
- How is one supposed to do that? 
 - Huh? What?

309
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:27,330
Treating her well. How do I do that?

310
00:20:27,330 --> 00:20:31,010
Why do you ask something like that? It's just like, if there is something she wants, do it for her.

311
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:35,660
If there is something that she's lacking, then be understanding and try to compliment her, just things like that.

312
00:20:35,660 --> 00:20:40,940
It's not as easy as it sounds. Even earlier, if it weren't for you, I would have been in trouble.

313
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,000
Thanks.

314
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:51,930
Oh my, I can't believe I'm hearing those things come out of his mouth.

315
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,520
It definitely must be love, it's love.

316
00:21:28,910 --> 00:21:31,520
It's moist.

317
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:38,170
Hm, why are you taking care of your lips?

318
00:21:38,170 --> 00:21:42,070
Hm... what could it be...what are you trying to do?

319
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:46,040
If you have the time to tease me about it, why don't you start looking at houses?

320
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:50,400
- When are you going to move out? 
 - Jerk, always holding your house over my head.

321
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:54,390
How is it going with Yeo Reum?

322
00:21:54,390 --> 00:21:58,560
What do you mean, how is it going? I'm just having lingering attachments, by myself.

323
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:03,400
Anyway, keep doing what you were doing. Put it on well, so they are moist.

324
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,990
Right... moist.

325
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:14,320
 Dieu Castle 

326
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:26,830
Oh Jim Sim, why are you here?

327
00:22:26,830 --> 00:22:29,730
What do you mean why am I here? I wanted to head to work with you so I'm here.

328
00:22:29,730 --> 00:22:34,300
This is the perk of dating someone in the same company, don't you agree?

329
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,180
Oh no, where did it go?

330
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:44,870
- You seem to have left something important. 
- Oh, yes...

331
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:48,440
my jealousy!

332
00:22:49,210 --> 00:22:52,530
I left my jealousy at home

333
00:22:52,530 --> 00:22:57,470
since such unnecessary emotions make our relationship feel more distant.

334
00:22:57,470 --> 00:23:02,080
From now on, I'm not going to carry any jealousy.

335
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,240
Anyway, shall we go?

336
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,470
Ah, wait.

337
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:10,740
- Please give me your car key. 
 - Huh? Why?

338
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:14,940
Since, Oh Jin Sim, you're pretty bad at driving and you find it difficult.

339
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,260
I can no longer let you suffer.

340
00:23:24,550 --> 00:23:27,500
Wait, he's worrying about me again. Here he goes again.

341
00:23:27,500 --> 00:23:30,300
I really can't take it!

342
00:23:38,790 --> 00:23:41,290
The mirror is really small.

343
00:23:41,290 --> 00:23:43,180
It's cute, isn't it?

344
00:23:43,960 --> 00:23:45,800
It's my lucky mascot.

345
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,980
I was cast on the street the day that I bought this.

346
00:23:47,980 --> 00:23:52,650
So I believe that this brought me good luck.

347
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:59,410
But you wouldn't need something like this, Mr. Lawyer.

348
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:05,430
Why? Because the Goddess of Luck who possesses this lucky mascot is your girlfriend!

349
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:12,120
Anyway, you make people feel so embarrassed.

350
00:24:13,010 --> 00:24:15,480
Can I hold your hand?

351
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:22,640
What? Why are you asking something like that so suddenly?

352
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:39,740
As you have already deduced, today at our Always law firm,

353
00:24:39,740 --> 00:24:44,150
these are the law school students who will be interning here. Introduce yourselves.

354
00:24:44,150 --> 00:24:46,350
- Hello!
 - Hello.

355
00:24:46,350 --> 00:24:49,150
Each of you should give a personal self-introduction.

356
00:24:49,150 --> 00:24:50,470
Hyung, you go first.

357
00:24:50,470 --> 00:24:53,520
- No, no. You go first.
- Okay.

358
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:57,310
Hello! I'm Lee Jeong Hwan.

359
00:24:57,310 --> 00:25:01,280
Hello, Sunbaes!  The man who will endlessly write

360
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:06,020
so that I don't miss a single pearl of wisdom to be learned from you, Kim Pil Gi greets you.

361
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:07,570
Okay.

362
00:25:09,010 --> 00:25:13,430
But, Jeong Hwan, your name sounds kind of like a female name.

363
00:25:13,430 --> 00:25:17,890
But you look really manly and handsome.

364
00:25:17,890 --> 00:25:20,720
You're right. You're a bit below my class,

365
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,440
but... you're pretty good looking.

366
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,580
Then, please take care of us!

367
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:29,580
Lawyer Yeon Joon Gyoo, Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok, Lawyer Choi Yoon Hyeok,

368
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:32,520
and Lawyer Dan Moon Hui.

369
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:36,170
H-How did you memorize all our names?

370
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:40,000
Was I caught? I looked on your homepage and memorized them.

371
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,750
Memorizing my senior's names in advance.

372
00:25:43,750 --> 00:25:47,860
- Isn't that the advantage of the internet? Right? 
 - Yes.

373
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:51,040
I would have to carve out of my right and left brain

374
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,300
the brilliant and noble honor of the shining star-like sunbaes.

375
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:59,060
- It's truly, once more, an honor.

376
00:26:00,390 --> 00:26:05,870
Ah, right, we're going on a workshop this weekend. Jeong Hwan and... Pil Se?

377
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:08,330
Pil Gi. Kim.

378
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:13,000
Pil Gi and Jeong Hwan, attend if you can.

379
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,340
- Thank you!
 - Thank you.

380
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:22,520
I'm sorry. I'm late because I was answering a client's phone call.

381
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:34,530
♫  Oh I come alive. Oh I come alive. I come alive.  ♫

382
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:42,680
Did they come here knowing that Oh Jin Sim is here?

383
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:47,320
Of course, I told them beforehand. I got them to sign a non-disclosure agreement.

384
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,230
They've lost their souls. They've lost them completely.

385
00:26:52,230 --> 00:26:55,160
Yoon Seo, please take care of these guys well.

386
00:26:55,160 --> 00:26:57,150
They're going to be learning in Lawyer Kwon's office.

387
00:26:57,150 --> 00:26:58,810
What? In my office?

388
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:03,750
Yeah. They're going to go through a rotation, and they're going to start with you.

389
00:27:09,230 --> 00:27:12,390
- Lawyer Kwon, have a talk with me.
 - Yes, sir.

390
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,000
It's so disappointing.

391
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:20,560
You must want to take Intern Lee Jeong Hwan right now and teach him how to work.

392
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:22,900
You're a maniac over good-looking people.

393
00:27:22,900 --> 00:27:28,080
I'm good. I have a boyfriend now— Ah, my goodness. It's a secret.

394
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:34,750
Oh, really? Is he possibly working as a volunteer?

395
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:40,190
My boyfriend is the boss of the cafe out front. Look.

396
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:43,530
He's seriously handsome, isn't he?

397
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:45,950
I always went here and ordered an Americano in the morning, and he—

398
00:27:45,950 --> 00:27:48,310
I'm sorry.  I'm bored.

399
00:27:48,310 --> 00:27:52,110
He bought it for me! He bought it for me, I said!

400
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:07,230
Alright. Then, from now on, we shall begin the orientation.

401
00:28:07,230 --> 00:28:13,320
There are several rules that you must keep in order to work with our Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok.

402
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,090
Alright, the first one is that you must be strictly punctual getting to work.

403
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:19,910
Mr. Lawyer detests people who are late.

404
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:23,320
And the second on is, you must get off work right on time.

405
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,190
Mr. Lawyer also detests people who can not complete their work within working hours.

406
00:28:28,190 --> 00:28:30,110
The third one, and this one is important,

407
00:28:30,110 --> 00:28:36,380
is that Mr. Lawyer detests people who recklessly touch everything that they see.

408
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:40,620
Well, there are a lot of things that he hates besides this,

409
00:28:40,620 --> 00:28:42,350
but you'll learn that slowly over time.

410
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:47,840
First, you must definitely strictly follow these three rules.

411
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,010
- Yes, ma'am!
 - Yes, ma'am.

412
00:28:49,010 --> 00:28:50,740
Then.

413
00:28:51,830 --> 00:28:55,250
Umm, Ms. Oh Yoon Seo.

414
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:58,970
You can just call me Secretary Oh here.

415
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,390
Ah, yes. Secretary Oh, um, I...

416
00:29:02,390 --> 00:29:06,650
I'm sorry, but can you give me your autograph?

417
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:07,780
My autograph?

418
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:10,270
Yes. I'm a huge fan, you see.

419
00:29:10,270 --> 00:29:14,400
I... then could I take one picture with you?

420
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,430
Th-then can I shake your hand one time?

421
00:29:16,430 --> 00:29:19,000
Then, can you say, "Jeong Hwan, good luck!"

422
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,120
- Then, can you say— 
 - Let's get to work.
 - "Let's get to work" one time...

423
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,020
Wh-what should we do, Secretary Oh? Lawyer Kwon seems to be really angry.

424
00:29:33,020 --> 00:29:37,020
I think that he detests me.

425
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:40,460
This won't do. I'll go beg him on my knees.

426
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,970
One moment! Don't misunderstand.

427
00:29:42,970 --> 00:29:45,900
He normally looks like that.

428
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,580
Here. These are the documents that you asked for.

429
00:29:52,580 --> 00:29:54,260
Yes, thank you.

430
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:58,630
By the way, you must be happy since your fans are here.

431
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:04,900
Honestly, I'd almost forgotten that I was a celebrity while I was working here.

432
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:08,690
But because they treat me like that, it's kind of nice.

433
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:15,690
But, are you possibly jealous?

434
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:18,030
Why would I do that? Did I not tell you?

435
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:20,030
There is no emotion more useless than jealousy.

436
00:30:20,030 --> 00:30:22,960
I also left my jealousy at home.

437
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:26,020
I would be fine with you being jealous, though.

438
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:27,510
What?

439
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:29,960
Never mind. It's nothing.

440
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:37,820
Then, I will take my leave now.

441
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:53,900
After the examination of witnesses, I think the court is leaning towards a not-guilty verdict,

442
00:30:53,900 --> 00:30:57,810
If so, don't you think the section head should be told that the charges might be dismissed?

443
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,470
No one knows until the verdict is announced.

444
00:31:00,470 --> 00:31:04,030
Don't get afraid in advance.   Look through the documents closely again.

445
00:31:04,030 --> 00:31:07,560
For anything missing, we can request again to submit more evidence.

446
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,520
So don't worry too much.

447
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:12,610
Thank you, Sunbaenim. Then I'll see you again.

448
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,350
Alright.

449
00:31:23,580 --> 00:31:24,830
Why are you looking at me like that?

450
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:27,080
Because it seems like you've returned to your real self.

451
00:31:27,080 --> 00:31:30,970
It wasn't like you to be faint-hearted.

452
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:35,020
Forget it. Set some time aside for me sometime. Let's eat.

453
00:31:35,020 --> 00:31:36,520
I should pay my debt back.

454
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:39,160
You didn't even like meeting eyes with me.

455
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,350
Have we gotten back to the level where we eat together?

456
00:31:43,350 --> 00:31:47,460
I told you that I was paying back a debt. If you don't want to, then don't.

457
00:31:47,460 --> 00:31:50,420
No, I like it. Pay your debt back.

458
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,640
Pay it back properly. Ah, what about this evening?

459
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:58,650
There are a lot of documents I have to look at today. Then.

460
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:02,620
Then let's choose a date soon.  As soon as possible.

461
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:16,670
Ah, yes. Please give me a cup of espresso.

462
00:32:17,190 --> 00:32:20,320
Yes, I'll submit the statement of my position by Wednesday.

463
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,580
Please read my submission and form your judgment.

464
00:32:23,580 --> 00:32:25,660
Yes, I understand.

465
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:29,390
Then I'll call you again. Yes.

466
00:32:36,680 --> 00:32:39,060
 My boyfriend is the owner of the cafe out front! 

467
00:32:39,060 --> 00:32:41,590
 He's extremely handsome, isn't he? 

468
00:32:49,130 --> 00:32:51,830
Here is the espresso you ordered.

469
00:32:51,830 --> 00:32:54,130
Yes, thank you.

470
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,960
- You waited a long time, didn't you?
 - Yeah.

471
00:32:55,960 --> 00:32:57,850
I'll enjoy the drink.

472
00:32:59,710 --> 00:33:01,230
I heard that you got a girlfriend.

473
00:33:01,230 --> 00:33:04,520
What girlfriend? Because I'm nice, I'm letting it slide.

474
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:08,450
Why? I heard that she's really good to you and even has a good job. Isn't she a lawyer?

475
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:10,660
What's so great about being a lawyer? I'm not attracted to her.

476
00:33:10,660 --> 00:33:12,290
Then you should just not date her.

477
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:14,380
I'm in a lawsuit with the landlord.

478
00:33:14,380 --> 00:33:16,680
If I'm going to resolve it, then how expensive do you think lawyer costs would be?

479
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:19,310
On top of that, she buys me food and buys me gifts.

480
00:33:19,310 --> 00:33:21,840
It's not without it's benefits.

481
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,790
Lawyer Dan.

482
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:33,650
Lawyer Dan!

483
00:33:35,690 --> 00:33:37,390
Lawyer Dan!

484
00:33:39,060 --> 00:33:42,580
Lawyer Dan. Lawyer Dan!

485
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:46,870
Are you alright?

486
00:33:48,150 --> 00:33:50,370
I'm not alright.

487
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:53,740
I'm not alright!

488
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:05,290
I knew that he didn't like me.

489
00:34:05,290 --> 00:34:07,320
Every time I wanted to meet, he would say that he was busy.

490
00:34:07,320 --> 00:34:09,460
When I go to see him, he looks annoyed.

491
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:13,920
If he liked me, he couldn't do that.

492
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:20,150
But I still I thought that it would work if I just worked hard.

493
00:34:21,360 --> 00:34:26,980
I didn't know he thought of me that way. I feel so foolish!

494
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,630
I can't end things like this.

495
00:34:37,630 --> 00:34:40,690
I'm going to cuss him out thoroughly.

496
00:34:42,210 --> 00:34:43,820
Lawyer Dan!

497
00:34:50,980 --> 00:34:53,690
There's a limit to playing with another person's heart!

498
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:56,360
How could you do that?  How could you?

499
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,280
Jeez.

500
00:34:59,120 --> 00:35:02,830
Did I ask you to date? Did I say I like you?

501
00:35:02,830 --> 00:35:06,270
No way. Did you actually think I was dating you because I liked you?

502
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:08,380
What are you doing?

503
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:20,320
Because you wouldn't accept my feelings, I wondered how great the guy was that you were dating.

504
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:24,800
Did you ignore my feelings so you could meet someone who is barely trash?

505
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:27,210
What?  Trash?  Are you done talking?

506
00:35:27,210 --> 00:35:29,030
I ...

507
00:35:29,030 --> 00:35:34,310
can't give a woman to someone like you because she's too precious for that.

508
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,930
Let's go.

509
00:36:05,810 --> 00:36:10,480
Lawyer Dan.  I don't want to give you advice at this time, but

510
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:16,630
from now on when you are looking at a man, instead of looking at his face, please look at his heart.

511
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:17,730
What?

512
00:36:17,730 --> 00:36:22,850
There are so many good men in this world.  Why are you crying because of a guy like that?

513
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:29,370
Get home safely.

514
00:36:31,740 --> 00:36:36,000
I thank ... you.

515
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,230
Yoon Seo,  do you have to go to the workshop?

516
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:50,460
You really aren't employed so why are you attending some workshop?

517
00:36:50,460 --> 00:36:54,320
Why? You never know.  There might be a workshop scene in this drama.

518
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,750
I have to experience reality like this.

519
00:36:56,750 --> 00:36:59,950
If such a scene does come up,  I could act it out realistically.

520
00:36:59,950 --> 00:37:03,880
Don't you think you're packing too unrealistically for doing a real-life experience?

521
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,780
Are you going somewhere in Europe?

522
00:37:05,780 --> 00:37:08,990
Won't it last just  one night and two days?  What is all this?

523
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:10,880
Hey, why are you bringing stuff to take a bath?

524
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:14,690
It's good for insomnia.  I'm going to have a bubble bath.

525
00:37:14,690 --> 00:37:16,880
Yoon Seo, if you go to a workshop and take a bubble bath,

526
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,890
people are really going to be annoyed by you.

527
00:37:18,890 --> 00:37:24,280
You'll be sharing a bathroom and will have to rush to wash your face and brush your teeth within three minutes.

528
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,830
Three minutes?

529
00:37:26,510 --> 00:37:28,250
That many minutes?

530
00:37:28,250 --> 00:37:34,140
I can't believe they are sending a newbie to a workshop who doesn't know anything. I feel so uneasy!

531
00:37:34,140 --> 00:37:36,770
I will pack just one bag for you.

532
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:39,070
- There's too much clothing.  
 - You can't do that.

533
00:37:39,070 --> 00:37:42,670
- There's too much.  Too much! Oh, make sure you take this.
 - Oppa!

534
00:37:42,670 --> 00:37:47,000
By the way. Don't forget to take one of the most important things.

535
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:49,610
- What's that? 
 - Your dignity as an actress.

536
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:54,900
Please don't make any mistakes after drinking.  Please maintain your dignity.

537
00:37:54,900 --> 00:37:57,360
All right.

538
00:37:57,360 --> 00:38:00,230
Now, although the workshop is important,  take care of your health first.

539
00:38:00,230 --> 00:38:01,520
 I'm almost there. 

540
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:04,100
- One for Lawyer Kwon. 
 - What?

541
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:08,030
Lawyer Kwon, what do you think?  Perfect workshop fashion.

542
00:38:08,030 --> 00:38:10,640
Doesn't it feel both trendy and elegant?

543
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:13,230
Elegant and trendy.  I think those two words escaped me.

544
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:16,440
I think you are a fashion ignoramus.

545
00:38:16,440 --> 00:38:18,590
- Look.  This is exactly how ... 
 - A fashionista!

546
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,550
It's called a fashionista.  A young person knows one when she sees one.

547
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:25,590
I wasn't saying that to you, CEO. Over there. I was talking about Yoon Seo.

548
00:38:42,990 --> 00:38:46,320
Seeing you outside, you shine even brighter, our Yoon Seo.

549
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:51,040
Seeing you every day, I'm in outer space. As expected, the goddess is a goddess.

550
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,800
I'll say. I'm so out of it, I want to pinch myself.

551
00:39:02,660 --> 00:39:05,130
I'm sorry.  I was the last to arrive.

552
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,660
What's wrong with being late? I'm just glad you arrived safely.

553
00:39:08,660 --> 00:39:13,020
You also take care of your health.  Two for you.  Thank you for coming.

554
00:39:13,020 --> 00:39:17,660
What thanks.  I'm the one who is thankful. It's my first time on a group outing like this.

555
00:39:17,660 --> 00:39:20,780
Really?  When you were a student, didn't you go on school trips?

556
00:39:20,780 --> 00:39:25,560
When I was in middle school, I couldn't go because I had my appendix removed the day before the trip.

557
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:29,320
When I was in high school, I debuted before the trip so I couldn't go.

558
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,980
So I never went on a group trip or an MT.  (  Motiviation Trip )

559
00:39:32,980 --> 00:39:37,830
So, I've been really looking forward to this workshop.

560
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:41,450
Well, if everyone is ready, let's go.

561
00:39:43,150 --> 00:39:45,220
Let's go!

562
00:39:59,030 --> 00:40:01,070
Aren't you going?

563
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:06,030
That is ... There are too many people at the rest stop.

564
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:10,360
That's true.  So many people  might be troublesome for you, Yoon Seo.

565
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:16,150
If you're really thirsty, you'll have to bear it.  I'll stay with you.

566
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:20,450
I will do the same. I will stay in the car with her.

567
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:25,050
No. Go and eat some tasty food and enjoy the air.

568
00:40:25,050 --> 00:40:27,260
Well, I'll go to the restroom and come right back.

569
00:40:27,260 --> 00:40:30,370
I'll be back even sooner.

570
00:40:30,370 --> 00:40:32,870
Come back safely!

571
00:40:32,870 --> 00:40:35,480
The hot bar looks yummy.

572
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:41,300
 Danudog
 Hot Dog Hot Bar; Sausages 

573
00:40:42,410 --> 00:40:45,190
One hot bar order please.

574
00:40:56,570 --> 00:40:59,810
 Hot Snacks 

575
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:06,860
Hot bar. Hot bar. Hot bar.

576
00:41:23,510 --> 00:41:25,750
I'm guessing you like hot bars?

577
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:41,210
Yoon Seo, please accept a hot bar from me.

578
00:41:41,210 --> 00:41:45,480
Please try some of the few I prepared.  A flower bouquet, no, I mean a hot bar bouquet.

579
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,060
He didn't even spread ketchup on.  I spread the ketchup.

580
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:51,870
Please put it on to your liking.  I had it prepared with difficulty without the ketchup.

581
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,860
I also spread mustard.

582
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,700
I heard you were allergic to mustard so I had it made without any.

583
00:41:56,700 --> 00:42:00,760
Ah? Well, I'll wipe the mustard off for you.

584
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:03,950
Yoon Seo doesn't like dirty things.

585
00:42:23,430 --> 00:42:26,730
You heard that I've taken on the Im Yoon Hui case, right?

586
00:42:26,730 --> 00:42:30,340
If I had been handling the case from the start, I would have resolved it neatly.

587
00:42:32,870 --> 00:42:38,480
Because of someone who is hopelessly ambitious, I am exhausted from coming back a long way.

588
00:42:40,840 --> 00:42:42,300
Kim Se Won!

589
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,050
Lee Joo Yeong!

590
00:42:46,950 --> 00:42:48,640
Come over here.

591
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:57,430
Sunbae, have some more meat.

592
00:42:57,430 --> 00:43:00,770
What's with you?  You eat it.

593
00:43:00,770 --> 00:43:06,090
You're savvy about the hierarchy.  If someone were to see you, they would know you are employed.

594
00:43:06,090 --> 00:43:09,610
Is it not allowed between a young man and young woman?

595
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:15,080
Yeah. All right, whatever.  You two look good together.  Be a couple.

596
00:43:15,080 --> 00:43:17,780
I'll try my best.

597
00:43:17,780 --> 00:43:20,940
Is that okay, Sunbae Yoo?

598
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:23,500
- Hey Lee Joo Yeong! 
 - Do you need my permission?

599
00:43:23,500 --> 00:43:29,850
No. But as a courtesy, I am asking you whether I can do my best for Sunbae Se Won.

600
00:43:30,790 --> 00:43:34,020
Don't make any effort.

601
00:43:34,020 --> 00:43:38,780
- Why not? 
 - No matter how hard you try, it won't turn out the way you want.

602
00:43:38,780 --> 00:43:41,080
I'm worried you'll be severely disappointed.

603
00:43:50,630 --> 00:43:56,020
 Sewoonsan Natural Forest Lodge 

604
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,490
This is so nice.

605
00:44:00,490 --> 00:44:04,910
When I was on a shoot,  I was alone in a huge hotel room.

606
00:44:04,910 --> 00:44:08,860
Because I thought of being with others like this, I feel like I am on a school trip and I'm so happy.

607
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:11,150
It's great right.  But even though it's nice here,

608
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,960
if you go back of here,  the landscape is even more amazing than here.

609
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:18,070
That's right.  The walkway there is really nice. How about we take a walk.

610
00:44:18,070 --> 00:44:19,490
- It would be nice to do that.  
 - Great.

611
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:22,100
Let's go on a walk. Let's unpack first and then go on a walk. Let's go.

612
00:44:22,100 --> 00:44:26,600
This way.   You can use the two here.  Right, Left.

613
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:30,240
- Do you like her that much? 
 - What?

614
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:32,830
You like Secretary Yang.

615
00:44:32,830 --> 00:44:34,700
Do I?

616
00:44:41,150 --> 00:44:44,370
Isn't it hard?  You should exercise.

617
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:49,910
- Isn't it hard, Yoon Seo? 
  - It's not.  It's a lot of fun, isn't it?

618
00:44:49,910 --> 00:44:53,910
This is the first time I've walked like this with so many people.  It's very exciting.

619
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:57,050
Yoon Seo.  It's like Princess Anne in Roman Holiday.

620
00:44:57,050 --> 00:45:02,230
Tired of the royal family household, she ran away.  She was happy with trivial ordinary routines.

621
00:45:02,300 --> 00:45:08,000
I'm so honored.  I really love Audrey Hepburn.

622
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,060
It seems you have caught a cold.

623
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:19,060
Does it?  It's chillier than I thought it would be.

624
00:45:19,060 --> 00:45:21,040
Secretary Oh, use this.

625
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,610
This is an electric hand warmer. It's an individual electronic felt hot pack.

626
00:45:24,610 --> 00:45:28,340
There's nothing to compare with it for keeping your hands warm.

627
00:45:28,340 --> 00:45:31,600
- Oh, it's warm. 
 - Please keep it.

628
00:45:34,210 --> 00:45:37,300
Excuse me, you need to wear this too.  It's very cold.

629
00:45:37,300 --> 00:45:40,050
No, not at all, CEO. You must be cold.

630
00:45:40,050 --> 00:45:44,140
I have light weight padding so it's enough.

631
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,930
It seems Secretary Oh's throat is dry.

632
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,610
Yoon Seo, have some vin chaud. ( mulled wine )

633
00:45:53,610 --> 00:45:57,020
When it's cold, it's perfect for drinking.

634
00:45:57,020 --> 00:46:00,200
This morning, all of a sudden the memory of drinking vin chaud,

635
00:46:00,200 --> 00:46:04,320
while standing on the bank of the Seine River in Paris was evoked, so I prepared a few things.

636
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:06,820
It's so rewarding.

637
00:46:06,820 --> 00:46:11,310
It's delicious.  I think my body is feeling warmer.

638
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,700
Everyone is concerned that she is cold, but why aren't you?

639
00:46:15,700 --> 00:46:21,260
Anyway, you haven't done anything but just put your hands in your pockets and squished them.

640
00:46:21,260 --> 00:46:24,440
How come you don't feel anything for Yoon Seo?

641
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:29,620
Yeah.  Earlier, everyone went to the hot bar for you but he came back by himself empty-handed.

642
00:46:29,620 --> 00:46:32,750
If it were me, I would take better care of my secretary.

643
00:46:32,750 --> 00:46:36,100
Lawyer Kwon is so heartless!

644
00:46:36,100 --> 00:46:39,120
Yoon Seo is too cold.  Let's stop the walk and go down.

645
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:42,440
Let's go down and get ready for the barbecue party.   Let's go, go!

646
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:45,760
Stop climbing up! Come down!

647
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:47,930
- Are we going down? 
 - We're going down.

648
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:49,600
- Keep going? 
 - Yes.

649
00:46:49,600 --> 00:46:53,320
- Yoon Seo seems very cold. 
  - It's okay. Let's go down first.

650
00:46:56,430 --> 00:46:59,500
Oh my, you guys bought so much alcohol.

651
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:02,720
I don't see Yoon Seo, I wonder where she went.

652
00:47:02,720 --> 00:47:07,300
It seemed like she was heading to her room before in order to prepare for the barbecue party.

653
00:47:15,650 --> 00:47:19,400
Oh my... look

654
00:47:23,220 --> 00:47:24,940
Why are you wearing a dress?

655
00:47:24,940 --> 00:47:28,850
Because you said there was going to be a barbecue party tonight.

656
00:47:28,850 --> 00:47:30,880
Is it not now?

657
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:36,230
Why are you all standing there like that? Aren't you going to get changed into dresses and tuxedos?

658
00:47:36,230 --> 00:47:41,160
Ah well that's because the barbecue parties that we have during team workshops are only called 'parties'.

659
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,750
In reality, they are just for eating pork, soju, and beer.

660
00:47:44,750 --> 00:47:48,140
- Feel free to wear anything comfortable that you want. 
 - Ah...

661
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:51,360
So it's that kind of atmosphere. I didn't know.

662
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:56,490
I'll quickly get changed into something else and come back.

663
00:47:58,570 --> 00:48:01,490
Our Yoon Seo is kind of quirky. Don't you think it's endearing?

664
00:48:01,490 --> 00:48:03,850
Yeah, she seems to be pretty innocent and pure.

665
00:48:03,850 --> 00:48:09,080
Yeah exactly. At first, I thought she would be sly and stuck up, but she's surprisingly cute.

666
00:48:10,060 --> 00:48:12,410
Ah, who would have thought she would have worn a dress?

667
00:48:12,410 --> 00:48:15,210
What it is? Why are you smiling Lawyer Kwon? It's kind of scary.

668
00:48:15,210 --> 00:48:18,950
What is scary about it? And also who bought this many snacks?

669
00:48:18,950 --> 00:48:20,880
Did we come to eat snacks?

670
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:23,250
Why is he getting angry at me?

671
00:48:31,570 --> 00:48:36,450
Whoa, whoa, be careful! Be careful! I will do this.

672
00:48:36,450 --> 00:48:39,980
This might not seem like much, but it requires expertise.

673
00:48:39,980 --> 00:48:43,990
First, the wind is blowing in... ah, this direction.

674
00:48:43,990 --> 00:48:48,440
You have to put your back to the wind. Then you have to pick the wood... I see you have picked the wood well.

675
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,710
Then, you have to place the flame for exactly three seconds.

676
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,770
One.

677
00:48:55,530 --> 00:48:57,750
Two.

678
00:48:59,170 --> 00:49:01,080
Three!

679
00:49:02,650 --> 00:49:05,220
Huh. Why isn't it working?

680
00:49:05,220 --> 00:49:06,870
I'll try it one more time.

681
00:49:06,870 --> 00:49:10,090
Can I try it once? It looks so fun!

682
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:15,940
You, Yoon Seo? Sure, have a go at it for fun. You may find it difficult.

683
00:49:16,580 --> 00:49:18,280
Here we go.

684
00:49:19,570 --> 00:49:22,100
One.

685
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:23,960
Two.

686
00:49:24,650 --> 00:49:26,530
Three! Wow!

687
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:33,990
- How did she get it already? 
 - Yay! It's like a campfire!

688
00:49:33,990 --> 00:49:39,350
Wow! It's my first time grilling meat outside.

689
00:49:42,490 --> 00:49:46,680
Here, everyone please fill your glasses so we can have a toast!

690
00:49:46,680 --> 00:49:48,640
Wow.

691
00:49:48,640 --> 00:49:50,950
Eat a lot.  It's the 10000 won.  I prepared it with the 10,000 won.

692
00:49:50,950 --> 00:49:53,060
The earthquake of the bar association.

693
00:49:53,060 --> 00:49:58,990
The law firm society's coming giant, 'Always' (firm name).

694
00:49:58,990 --> 00:50:03,160
Cheers. You worked hard.

695
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:08,110
Since it seems like the atmosphere is lively as well,

696
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:12,680
we'll start the 'Always Awards'.

697
00:50:12,680 --> 00:50:14,730
'Always Awards'? What is that?

698
00:50:14,730 --> 00:50:18,120
Oh, at every workshop, we have an awards ceremony.

699
00:50:18,120 --> 00:50:20,170
Oh really? That's awesome!

700
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:24,400
It's nothing big. It's just since everyone is working so hard for Always,

701
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:28,230
people might appreciate receiving a few awards during the workshops.

702
00:50:28,230 --> 00:50:30,870
It's just this CEO's small gift of appreciation.

703
00:50:30,870 --> 00:50:36,990
So, we'll get started with the awards ceremony now. The first recipient.

704
00:50:36,990 --> 00:50:40,730
Kwon Jeong Rok! Applause!

705
00:50:41,930 --> 00:50:48,270
Here, the award's name is: "First in Sales Revenue Again."

706
00:50:48,270 --> 00:50:50,650
Am I an insurance king or something? What do you mean revenue?

707
00:50:50,650 --> 00:50:52,350
Why? It's witty and fun.

708
00:50:52,350 --> 00:50:57,860
As a prize, I've prepared two volumes of  Humor Heaven.

709
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,300
Applause!!

710
00:51:01,950 --> 00:51:07,370
Next winner is, Lawyer Choi Yoon Hyeok.

711
00:51:08,700 --> 00:51:11,720
The name of the award is: "First Place Tomorrow."

712
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:17,560
We hope that you will work hard and surpass Lawyer Kwon and will be in first place. Applause!

713
00:51:19,760 --> 00:51:25,940
Yes, it may be difficult but I will focus less on justice and sense of duty,

714
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:30,200
and will instead become a lawyer that focuses more on driving revenue.

715
00:51:32,300 --> 00:51:35,820
Next is Lawyer Dan.

716
00:51:35,820 --> 00:51:40,140
The award name is 'Please Be Less Timid' award.

717
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:49,300
- Secretary Yang. 'Always the same'. 
 - Award name:

718
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:55,400
Only your face is scary. Your face may be scary but your work ethic is very polished and soft.

719
00:51:55,400 --> 00:52:01,070
And lastly, the idol of the reception desk! Applause!

720
00:52:01,070 --> 00:52:06,090
I've also prepared two concert tickets. Applause.

721
00:52:06,090 --> 00:52:11,300
And with this, we'll now be wrapping up the award ceremony here...

722
00:52:11,300 --> 00:52:18,360
but today, we have prepared a special award. Today's special award

723
00:52:18,360 --> 00:52:20,410
goes to...

724
00:52:21,380 --> 00:52:24,140
Oh Yoon Seo!

725
00:52:25,500 --> 00:52:27,520
Really? You're giving me an award too?

726
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:29,630
Please come forward!

727
00:52:30,650 --> 00:52:34,900
As a prize, we'll be giving you a pair of slippers to wear comfortably at the office,

728
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:39,480
'Always Vitamin Award'! Applause!

729
00:52:40,260 --> 00:52:45,020
Since the reception is so good, I'll specially read out the award contents.

730
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:48,850
'Always Vitamin Award', Oh Yoon Seo.

731
00:52:48,850 --> 00:52:52,890
'This person, coming from a universe's goddess status, could have found it difficult to adjust.

732
00:52:52,890 --> 00:52:55,900
However, with her diligent work ethic and bright smile,

733
00:52:55,900 --> 00:53:02,770
as she has become an important, vitamin-like person in the 'Always Law Firm' we present this award.

734
00:53:05,030 --> 00:53:07,560
Thank you!

735
00:53:07,560 --> 00:53:12,510
Actually, I wonder if I should be allowed to accept this award.

736
00:53:12,510 --> 00:53:16,770
But, I will consider it to be a catalyst to work harder in the future

737
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:21,110
and will accept it with a happy heart. Thank you!

738
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:28,570
Hearing Yoon Seo's acceptance speech, doesn't it sound like the end of the year awards ceremony?

739
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:32,100
She could have just worn that dress from earlier!

740
00:53:32,100 --> 00:53:35,800
Here here. Let's clean up.

741
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:44,780
Ah yes. I will discuss the schedule with the prosecution side and will give you a call back.

742
00:53:46,560 --> 00:53:49,230
We ran out of beer so I'm on the way to get some more.

743
00:53:49,230 --> 00:53:51,870
You look very happy today.

744
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:56,410
Yes, extremely. These are all new experiences for me, so it's all very exciting.

745
00:53:56,410 --> 00:54:01,000
And also, everyone seems like really good people. They're also very kind to me.

746
00:54:02,500 --> 00:54:05,720
- I am also treating you we— 
 - What are you doing there?

747
00:54:05,720 --> 00:54:07,310
- Oh? Why are you all coming out?

748
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:10,220
Because it's getting colder out here and everyone seems to be a bit tired.

749
00:54:10,220 --> 00:54:12,230
Oh, it's already the end.

750
00:54:12,230 --> 00:54:14,530
Let's go inside, Yoon Seo. Ah, something must have gotten into my eye.

751
00:54:14,530 --> 00:54:16,080
- Does anyone have a mirror? 
 - I don't.

752
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:19,270
- I do! 
 - Oh really?

753
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:23,740
Oh.

754
00:54:26,090 --> 00:54:29,640
The hand-mirror must take after its owner.  It's so beautiful.

755
00:54:29,640 --> 00:54:34,240
I'll use it preciously and will return it to you. Let's head in.

756
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:38,190
Let's go.

757
00:54:44,700 --> 00:54:49,070
But, are we just going to sleep like this? I feel like it would be a shame.

758
00:54:49,070 --> 00:54:51,370
Hm, then why don't we can talk for some time and then go to sleep.

759
00:54:51,370 --> 00:54:54,910
But, aren't you craving something spicy?

760
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:57,310
Since we only ate meat, which was a bit greasy.

761
00:54:57,310 --> 00:55:00,160
Should we eat bibim noodles (noodles mixed with vegetables) then?

762
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,690
I bought extra ingredients for it earlier, since I thought we might end up eating it as a midnight snack.

763
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:09,830
As expected Secretary Yang. Someone who is so diligent at work is also great at preparing for the workshop too.

764
00:55:09,830 --> 00:55:12,840
Wait for a bit.

765
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:24,280
Lawyer Dan, why do you have no appetite?

766
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:27,660
Your expression also isn't that good. Is there something going on?

767
00:55:27,660 --> 00:55:30,370
It seems like she broke up with her boyfriend.

768
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:33,670
How do you know that, Hae Yeong?

769
00:55:33,670 --> 00:55:38,370
What do you mean how do I know? You're the one that was staring at your phone the whole day, waiting for your boyfriend's response.

770
00:55:38,370 --> 00:55:42,070
Now you're just looking off into space, just sighing loudly.

771
00:55:42,070 --> 00:55:44,840
That means that there is no longer a boyfriend to hear from.

772
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:50,000
But, you liked him so much. How did that happen?

773
00:55:51,030 --> 00:55:55,670
It turns out that he didn't have any feelings for me.

774
00:55:55,670 --> 00:55:59,260
He just wanted to use me because he was in a lawsuit with his landlord.

775
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:02,670
What? He's such a crazy a**hole.

776
00:56:02,670 --> 00:56:06,250
You're a celebrity. You shouldn't be saying such things.

777
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:09,200
But it makes me so angry.

778
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,990
Lawyer Dan really liked him, right?

779
00:56:11,990 --> 00:56:16,740
How can someone use another person's innocent feelings?

780
00:56:16,740 --> 00:56:20,020
I am not going to love again.

781
00:56:20,020 --> 00:56:25,270
From now on, my heart is on temporary suspension.

782
00:56:31,830 --> 00:56:34,400
There aren't any towels in the bathroom.

783
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:35,860
This is the last one.

784
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:38,850
Oh my Jong Hwa, Jong Hwa!

785
00:56:38,850 --> 00:56:42,780
Then you shouldn't have used the towel and should have just dried off with your clothes or something.

786
00:56:42,780 --> 00:56:45,660
What are our sunbaes going to dry off with?

787
00:56:45,660 --> 00:56:47,420
You're overreacting too much.

788
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:51,160
They said there were a lot of towels at the women's rooms. Just ask them to bring us a few.

789
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:55,430
Okay. Then I will contact them right away.

790
00:56:55,430 --> 00:56:59,610
But, you've been laughing for a while now. What are you looking at?

791
00:56:59,610 --> 00:57:03,110
Oh this? This is the group photo that we took earlier.

792
00:57:03,110 --> 00:57:05,840
Isn't Yoon Seo so beautiful?

793
00:57:06,590 --> 00:57:10,740
Wow, she is really beautiful. And on top of that, she's so polite.

794
00:57:10,740 --> 00:57:14,280
And also innocent! I used to like her before but I like her even more now.

795
00:57:14,280 --> 00:57:18,200
Right? But for someone like Yoon Seo,

796
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,370
I wonder what kind of guy she would date.

797
00:57:20,370 --> 00:57:26,840
So, I searched for Secretary Oh's ideal type.

798
00:57:27,500 --> 00:57:31,910
'A guy who can make her heart feel touched'

799
00:57:31,910 --> 00:57:35,130
is what she said.

800
00:57:35,130 --> 00:57:37,970
This, this, this. She's talking about me.

801
00:57:37,970 --> 00:57:43,720
Earlier, I bought her a hot bar and provided her with vin chaud. Imagine how touched she would have felt.

802
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:48,760
Stop it. Just a single hot bar and tsing tao, I mean vin chaud.

803
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:53,820
You brought the vin chaud to drink it yourself and you just shared a little bit.

804
00:57:53,820 --> 00:57:56,760
She was probably touched by me, Yeon Joon Gyoo.

805
00:57:56,760 --> 00:57:59,730
I bought her how many hot bars? A bouquet full.

806
00:57:59,730 --> 00:58:02,650
And I gave her my coat so that she wouldn't catch a cold,

807
00:58:02,650 --> 00:58:07,800
and with the 'Always Vitamin Award,' it's a three level combo. Bam! Bam! Bam!

808
00:58:07,800 --> 00:58:09,650
You are truly impressive, sir.

809
00:58:09,650 --> 00:58:12,510
I didn't give her anything other than a hot bar and an electric warmer.

810
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:16,280
I also did catch that she had a dry throat, but that's probably insufficient (weak) right?

811
00:58:16,280 --> 00:58:20,270
- Too weak 
 - Definitely too weak. You should have done more.

812
00:58:20,270 --> 00:58:24,010
The way I see it, I have the most potential, but

813
00:58:24,010 --> 00:58:28,280
- the only thing that is for sure, is that it isn't Lawyer Kwon. 
 - Excuse me?

814
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:32,900
It's true. Out of all of us, who do you think the person who touched her heart the least?

815
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:34,800
It's Lawyer Kwon.

816
00:58:34,800 --> 00:58:38,750
Don't even mention usually treating her poorly. Just think carefully about today.

817
00:58:38,750 --> 00:58:41,770
Did you treat her well or not? Of course not!

818
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:45,140
- Lawyer Kwon, eliminated! 
 - Lawyer Kwon, eliminated!

819
00:58:45,140 --> 00:58:47,610
From her ideal type, you're eliminated!

820
00:58:47,610 --> 00:58:52,270
Those eliminated, please bring out the blankets. Let's go to sleep. Let's clean this up.

821
00:58:52,270 --> 00:58:56,240
Here, those who were eliminated, please spread out the blankets.

822
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:58,990
- At first glance, he seems good looking. However, he's too arrogant and cold. 
 - That's true.

823
00:58:58,990 --> 00:59:02,220
Take a look at this.   I didn't use any photo app,  but I  don't show a single pore.

824
00:59:02,220 --> 00:59:07,210
- You need to sleep, is this your pajamas? 
 - No, I'm going to wash up later—

825
00:59:08,230 --> 00:59:09,950
Why, what's up?

826
00:59:09,950 --> 00:59:10,800
What's the meaning of this?

827
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:13,680
Since you asked for blankets, I wanted to get them to you quickly.

828
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:14,870
I must have been too fast.

829
00:59:14,870 --> 00:59:17,580
I think you were too fast. My hair is all ruined.

830
00:59:17,580 --> 00:59:19,060
Why didn't he say something?

831
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:21,490
Can you give me the mirror?

832
00:59:21,530 --> 00:59:25,860
I put the mirror that Oh Yoon Seo gave me in here...

833
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:28,820
I definitely put it in here.

834
00:59:28,820 --> 00:59:32,090
I got it from Yoon Seo and put it in here.

835
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:36,040
Oh, I must have dropped it. I'm going crazy!

836
00:59:36,040 --> 00:59:38,600
Oh my, where did it go?

837
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,120
But Secretary Yang, do you have any thoughts on dating?

838
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:44,270
What do you mean, me dating?

839
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:48,360
I'm so busy with company work and house chores that the day goes by so fast.

840
00:59:48,420 --> 00:59:51,730
And, if I have such time, I should spend more time with Jin.

841
00:59:51,730 --> 00:59:57,120
But, if there were  someone who knew your situation well and

842
00:59:57,160 --> 01:00:02,270
could understand, wouldn't it be okay for you to open your heart to them?

843
01:00:02,270 --> 01:00:07,490
I can't say.  I don't have the confidence to date anyone anymore.

844
01:00:12,550 --> 01:00:17,220
Instead of doing this, should we drink some?

845
01:00:21,080 --> 01:00:24,420
- What is this? 
 - Tada!

846
01:00:24,460 --> 01:00:27,430
Whoa, is this wine? It looks like it's pretty nice!

847
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:32,260
Oh actually, I heard that there was a party

848
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:35,810
so I brought it, but I think this is the perfect time to drink it.

849
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:45,000
Even if it's not right now, I wish Secretary Yang would meet someone nice.

850
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:48,040
And also, Lawyer Dan, you should have some energy and feel better.

851
01:00:48,040 --> 01:00:51,740
You can have some revenge on that jerk when you get back to Seoul.

852
01:00:51,780 --> 01:00:52,920
Revenge?

853
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,860
Yeah, you've got to do something!

854
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:59,530
You should write, "A**hole*, and stick it on the cafe that he's running.

855
01:01:01,180 --> 01:01:02,720
Thanks, Yoon Seo.

856
01:01:02,770 --> 01:01:05,560
A celebrity, who is willing to cuss out and exact revenge on my behalf...

857
01:01:05,560 --> 01:01:08,430
With everyone willing to take my side and cuss him out, I feel

858
01:01:08,430 --> 01:01:10,840
a little better.

859
01:01:10,840 --> 01:01:15,400
Anyway, it feels good to talk about my feelings and thoughts.

860
01:01:15,400 --> 01:01:18,730
I also really really like this sort of setting.

861
01:01:18,730 --> 01:01:22,040
To be honest, I've been a celebrity for a while but

862
01:01:22,040 --> 01:01:25,780
I didn't really have any friends to talk to about my feelings and so I was a bit lonely.

863
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:28,590
But when you see TV broadcasts,

864
01:01:28,590 --> 01:01:34,320
you seem really close to Kim Min Ji and Yang Soo Jin, is that not the case?

865
01:01:34,320 --> 01:01:38,710
That's just for show. I don't even know their phone numbers.

866
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,980
Can you give me your phone, Yoon Seo?

867
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:46,870
Huh?

868
01:01:50,420 --> 01:01:52,790
This is my number.

869
01:01:52,790 --> 01:01:57,590
I'm not a fun conversationalist and there isn't much I can do for you.

870
01:01:57,590 --> 01:02:02,410
If you want to eat bibim noodles, I can make it for you.

871
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,860
Here, let's have a toast!

872
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:09,580
- Cheers! 
 - Yes.

873
01:02:09,580 --> 01:02:11,200
Cheers!

874
01:02:12,780 --> 01:02:14,930
Drink it in one shot!

875
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:24,140
Yeah, the best revenge is

876
01:02:24,140 --> 01:02:26,100
for me to get over it fast and to live happily.

877
01:02:26,150 --> 01:02:30,900
I can just meet someone who is better than that jerk!

878
01:02:43,450 --> 01:02:45,420
Olé!

879
01:02:51,060 --> 01:02:54,520
Oh sorry! I thought no one was in here.

880
01:02:54,560 --> 01:02:58,470
This is good. I was about to use a used towel and was feeling gross about it.

881
01:02:58,470 --> 01:03:00,670
Nice timing.

882
01:03:15,910 --> 01:03:18,180
Please be careful.

883
01:03:18,180 --> 01:03:20,280
Olé!

884
01:03:29,990 --> 01:03:32,610
Mr. Lawyer, what are you up to?

885
01:03:32,610 --> 01:03:34,660
Are you sleeping?

886
01:03:34,660 --> 01:03:36,200
Yoon Seo.

887
01:03:36,200 --> 01:03:39,460
Oh hi, sir. You didn't go to sleep yet?

888
01:03:39,460 --> 01:03:42,660
I don't know what to do, I'm so sorry.

889
01:03:42,660 --> 01:03:43,430
Why?

890
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:46,850
I think I lost the hand mirror of yours.

891
01:03:46,850 --> 01:03:50,360
I changed clothes and I definitely put it in here but

892
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:55,520
I don't see it inside. I think I might have lost it somewhere outside.

893
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:59,350
Oh it's okay. It's not that important. No need to worry!

894
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:04,080
- It's okay. It's just a mirror. I can buy another one. 
 - Is that so?

895
01:04:04,080 --> 01:04:07,330
Oh, I was worrying for nothing. Anyway, I'm sorry.

896
01:04:07,370 --> 01:04:08,990
Oh no, it's fine. Have a good night!

897
01:04:08,990 --> 01:04:10,470
Okay, I'm heading in. Have a good night!

898
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:12,460
Okay.

899
01:04:31,030 --> 01:04:34,310
It's okay, it's just a mirror.

900
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:37,720
You had a fun time today, that should be enough.

901
01:05:14,280 --> 01:05:16,150
Oh Jin Sim.

902
01:05:16,150 --> 01:05:18,840
Oh? Mr. Lawyer.

903
01:05:21,210 --> 01:05:24,690
Why are you out here at this time, Oh Jin Sim? I thought you would be asleep for sure.

904
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:29,380
Ah, I have insomnia so I wasn't able to fall asleep.

905
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:32,620
So I just came out to get some fresh air.

906
01:05:32,660 --> 01:05:34,420
And there is also something I need to find.

907
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:37,480
Why are you out here, Mr. Lawyer?

908
01:05:37,480 --> 01:05:40,800
Ah, actually...

909
01:05:45,910 --> 01:05:49,360
Oh my! How is this possible?

910
01:05:49,360 --> 01:05:52,470
I heard the CEO mention that he lost it earlier.

911
01:05:52,470 --> 01:05:57,290
I remembered that you said it was your good luck mascot (charm), so I wanted to find it for you.

912
01:05:57,290 --> 01:06:02,000
So then, you were out here this late at night, in order to find it for me?

913
01:06:03,730 --> 01:06:06,940
Thank you, Mr. Lawyer.

914
01:06:09,270 --> 01:06:13,320
I finally was able to do something for you.

915
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,240
Huh?

916
01:06:15,240 --> 01:06:20,070
Honestly, I wanted to treat you well, Oh Jin Sim.

917
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:25,120
If there were any request that you had, to do it for you. If there were anything lacking, to fill it for you.

918
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:28,350
That was what I wanted to do.

919
01:06:28,350 --> 01:06:32,300
But I missed all those opportunities.

920
01:06:32,340 --> 01:06:35,740
I would like to be the one to make you smile and laugh, Oh Jin Sim,

921
01:06:35,740 --> 01:06:38,930
but other people keep seizing the opportunities first.

922
01:06:38,970 --> 01:06:41,920
So I felt a little down today.

923
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:52,440
Mr. Lawyer, is that by any chance, jealousy?

924
01:06:52,440 --> 01:06:55,900
Yes, that's correct. It's jealousy.

925
01:06:55,900 --> 01:07:00,080
Jealousy. I thought it was an unnecessary emotion,

926
01:07:01,680 --> 01:07:07,010
but it seems like if you like someone, it is difficult to control one's emotions.

927
01:07:13,620 --> 01:07:18,440
Why are you looking at me like that? Am I being too childish?

928
01:07:18,440 --> 01:07:22,660
Nope, because I like it.

929
01:07:22,660 --> 01:07:28,070
Because it sounds like you like me so much it is difficult for you to control your emotions,

930
01:07:28,070 --> 01:07:31,380
I'm so happy.

931
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,240
Mr. Lawyer.

932
01:07:43,390 --> 01:07:46,950
May I please

933
01:07:46,950 --> 01:07:51,330
give you a kiss, Mr. Lawyer?

934
01:07:52,550 --> 01:07:54,920
Excuse me?

935
01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:59,020
Ah, now?

936
01:07:59,020 --> 01:08:02,490
But why would you ask that?

937
01:08:06,130 --> 01:08:10,260
Just because you're so lovable right now, Mr. Lawyer.

938
01:08:10,260 --> 01:08:16,380
Mr. Lawyer, next time, you should just do it without asking me.

939
01:08:16,380 --> 01:08:19,560
If you're going to do it later.

940
01:08:19,610 --> 01:08:23,060
Let's go inside since it's cold.

941
01:08:39,600 --> 01:08:42,380
Since you told me not to ask you first.

942
01:08:42,380 --> 01:08:46,740


943
01:08:46,770 --> 01:08:50,290
♫    Full of something I don't know  ♫

944
01:08:50,290 --> 01:08:56,140
♫   Honestly, for me it's difficult umm   ♫

945
01:08:56,140 --> 01:08:59,410
♫   Timing is what it is     ♫

946
01:08:59,460 --> 01:09:04,050
♫   Why did it get twisted on its own?  ♫

947
01:09:04,100 --> 01:09:09,250
♫  My slow moving heart  ♫

948
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:14,500
♫  Searched for you with all my might  ♫

949
01:09:14,500 --> 01:09:17,410
♫  Within a footstep's reach   ♫

950
01:09:17,410 --> 01:09:22,960
♫  I'm here, are you waiting for something?   ♫

951
01:09:23,000 --> 01:09:32,200
♫  Ooh love love is What is it? What is love?  ♫

952
01:09:32,300 --> 01:09:39,800
♫  Ooh love How should I say it?  What if love?  ♫

953
01:09:39,800 --> 01:09:41,330
♫  Probably for me it's you  ♫

954
01:09:41,330 --> 01:09:43,230
 Touch Your Heart 
 ♫ one one one ♫  

955
01:09:43,300 --> 01:09:47,400
  Ms. Jin Sim, Jin Sim, Jin Sim.  You're so beautiful. 

956
01:09:47,430 --> 01:09:50,640
 Who are you? Our lawyer is someone who isn't able to say such sweet things. 

957
01:09:50,640 --> 01:09:53,110
 Don't you think the people at our law firm will be suspicious of us? 

958
01:09:53,110 --> 01:09:54,710
 I think we should be careful. 

959
01:09:54,710 --> 01:09:57,380
 What is the reason for you to escort her home today? 

960
01:09:57,380 --> 01:09:58,540
 Seriously, why are you being like this? 

961
01:09:58,540 --> 01:10:01,020
 Why exactly are you unable to eat alone? 

962
01:10:01,020 --> 01:10:04,030
 I will help you so why don't you practice a little bit at a time? 

963
01:10:04,030 --> 01:10:07,130
 There is only one month left until you quit working at the law firm. 

964
01:10:07,130 --> 01:10:10,740
 I wonder if Lawyer Kwon will be sad when Yoon Seo quits. 

965
01:10:10,740 --> 01:10:15,220
 I felt that it wasn't right for there to be secrets between those who should be the closest. 

966
01:10:15,280 --> 01:10:17,110
 Where did you say Lee Gyeong Joon is? 

967
01:10:17,110 --> 01:10:20,070
 How did he know to follow us? 

968
01:10:21,180 --> 01:10:24,860
 From now on, Oh Jin Sim's problems are my problems.
