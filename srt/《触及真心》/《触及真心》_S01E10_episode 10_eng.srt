1
00:00:00,050 --> 00:00:05,100


2
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:41,020
  Touch Your Heart 

3
00:00:41,890 --> 00:00:43,680
 Episode 10 

4
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,110
Hey, Lawyer Kwon!

5
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:57,070
Since you were quiet for a while .... in front of the elevator once again ...

6
00:00:57,070 --> 00:00:59,100
Do you think that I was waiting for you?

7
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:02,290
I was waiting for you. I waited for about three and a half hours.

8
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:04,730
Goodness. You're saying something ridiculous.

9
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:08,520
Why would I wait for you? Though I might do it for Yoon Seo.

10
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,200
Awesome! Yoon Seo!

11
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:16,410
Miss Yoon Seo.

12
00:01:36,450 --> 00:01:38,450
They say that they're an office couple.

13
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:42,700
Someone saw them on the rooftop holding hands secretly.

14
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:45,950
Oh, I see. No wonder.

15
00:01:45,950 --> 00:01:49,060
Goodness, those are the good days.

16
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:52,190
You express your affection for each other without other people knowing

17
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:54,750
and go up on the rooftop secretly to have a date.

18
00:01:54,750 --> 00:01:57,540
If you're that jealous, you should have an in-office relationship too.

19
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:02,280
Oh! Mr. CEO, you aren't married?

20
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:09,660
- I'm seeing you smile for the first time in a long while, Lawyer Kwon.
 - Yes.

21
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:17,220
I look like I should be married, but unfortunately, I'm still single.

22
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,020
In my thirties, I was busy standing on the side of the weak and defending them for the sake of justice.

23
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,900
And in my forties, in the frontline of administering the law firm, I worked day and night.

24
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:29,430
Yes, I'm still single.

25
00:02:29,430 --> 00:02:34,760
I see. Why? You're cool and nice. You should hurry and date.

26
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,960
You really could have an in-office relationship.

27
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:41,650
As you said, it's thrilling and so romantic.

28
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:44,750
An in-office relationship? With whom?

29
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,560
Good morning!

30
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,730
- You're here?
 - Good morning!

31
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:53,210
Come and have some of this waffle. Lawyer Choi bought it for us.

32
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,140
Wow, it's a good thing I didn't eat breakfast.

33
00:02:56,140 --> 00:02:58,690
That looks delicious. I love waffles.

34
00:02:58,690 --> 00:03:01,730
Have a seat. Sit down.

35
00:03:02,750 --> 00:03:05,120
- Wow.
 - Wow.

36
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:09,930
But why did you suddenly buy waffles?

37
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,340
Because I suddenly had a memory of when she left in winter while I was in Canada.

38
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:18,160
The only thing that warmed my body and heart

39
00:03:18,160 --> 00:03:21,020
in the frozen cold Canadian snow

40
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:25,340
was this waffle liberally covered in maple syrup.

41
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,060
- How is it?
 - It's good.

42
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:32,950
It is good, isn't it?

43
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:35,810
The syrup?

44
00:03:35,810 --> 00:03:38,310
It's good.

45
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,100
Yoon Seo.

46
00:03:48,100 --> 00:03:51,360
Why are you doing this?

47
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,060
Ah, ow.

48
00:03:54,290 --> 00:03:55,930
- Did you get something in your eye?
 - Yes.

49
00:03:55,930 --> 00:03:57,400
Something went in her eye. Oh no, what should we  do?

50
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,690
Don't worry.

51
00:03:58,690 --> 00:04:01,070
Something big went in.

52
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,370
It's in my room. I'll get it from my room.

53
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,320
- Should I blow in it for you?
 - No, I'm okay.

54
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:21,310
What's with that? What am I supposed to do if you suddenly wink in a place with everyone like that?

55
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:25,290
Earlier in the elevator, you said that an in-office relationship where you express your affection for each other secretly

56
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,330
was thrilling and romantic, didn't you? That's why.

57
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,390
What's with that? But still, if you suddenly wink at me like that,

58
00:04:33,390 --> 00:04:36,610
I get surprised!

59
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:39,450
- I see.
 - Seriously!

60
00:04:40,760 --> 00:04:44,270
This won't do. We'll have to spend the rest of my time here fruitfully.

61
00:04:44,270 --> 00:04:48,590
- So that this time won't go to waste.
 - I'll assist you to the best of my ability.

62
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,830
Okay!

63
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,450
This is good.

64
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,800
Now that I think about it, this is our first time eating lunch with Yoon Seo.

65
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,500
Yes. Because restaurants are filled to the brim with people at lunchtime,

66
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:07,230
it's a little burdensome to go.

67
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:10,830
That's right. You feel uncomfortable at places with a lot of people, don't you?

68
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,250
Then should I have not asked you out to lunch with us today?

69
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:17,940
No, no. A room-like place like this is okay.

70
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:22,050
Wow, the side dishes are pretty good today.

71
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:25,620
- Let's enjoy them.
 - Everyone enjoy your food.
 - Eat up.

72
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,800
 Oh Jin Sim, I moved some soy sauce braised beef in front of you since you like meat. 

73
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,930
Shall I pour you some water?

74
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:45,460
Yeah. Thank you, thank you. Ah, thank you.

75
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:56,350
 I moved the fried ham in front of you. Since you like foods that children like. 

76
00:05:56,350 --> 00:05:59,670
 Okay. I ate some right away. Then enjoy your meal. 

77
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:01,490
- Lawyer Kwon.
 - Yes?

78
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:04,570
To whom are you sending messages while you're eating?

79
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:07,090
I keep getting text messages from a client.

80
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:13,360
Seeing my sunbae being so full of passion about his work that he can't even stop working while he's eating

81
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:15,890
has become a great example for me.

82
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:19,650
I respect and admire you so much. Right?

83
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,310
I also admire you.

84
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:23,040
You're great at going overboard.

85
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:26,000
You should work in moderation. What's with working while eating?

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,100
Lawyer Kwon, now that I look at you closely, I think you're addicted to work.

87
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:31,960
He's right. You work so much that I worry about you sometimes, Mr. Lawyer.

88
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:34,390
Why? It's fine as long as he's enjoying himself.

89
00:06:34,390 --> 00:06:38,440
Lawyer Kwon sincerely likes to work.

90
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,240
Yes. I sincerely like it.  (A play on Jin Sim's name that sounds like he's saying he likes Jin Sim) 

91
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,140
- You said that you have something to tell me. What is it?
 - About that.

92
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:02,350
- I wanted to tell you that the soy sauce braised beef from earlier was really good.

93
00:07:02,350 --> 00:07:07,060
What? But why are you telling me that here?

94
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:08,740
Well, that's...

95
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:12,990
When you look at dramas about in-office romances, they always meet in staircases like this.

96
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,430
So I also wanted to try it once.

97
00:07:17,580 --> 00:07:20,520
If you have time later this evening, would you like to have dinner together?

98
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:23,140
A date? Of course, I'd love to!

99
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:26,600
- Then I'll make a reservation at a nice place. 
- Okay.

100
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:46,560
Please print out the instructions for submission of the  taxpayer's protest of the assessment as soon as possible.

101
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,650
Yes, Mr. Lawyer. I will send you a report.

102
00:07:48,650 --> 00:07:51,950
- Hurry up and go! What are you doing?
 - Yes, sir.

103
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:55,130
You must have felt uneasy.

104
00:07:55,130 --> 00:08:00,360
Since you knew very well that it is illegal to gamble, yet even went overseas and did so. (For Koreans, gambling is illegal even outside of South Korea.)

105
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,180
But what should we do? This could sound hopeless,

106
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:06,020
but since this isn't your first time being caught gambling,

107
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:10,050
I think that it'll be difficult for you to get a light punishment.

108
00:08:11,530 --> 00:08:18,530
I also resent myself for being like this.

109
00:08:18,530 --> 00:08:22,540
I know better than anyone that I shouldn't be like this,

110
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,890
but why do I keep falling into it?

111
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:26,960
That's true.

112
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:31,190
Why do I keep falling?

113
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:32,950
I think that I'm crazy.

114
00:08:32,950 --> 00:08:35,380
What did you say? You said that you think I'm crazy.

115
00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:38,760
Wait, that's a little harsh!

116
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:43,050
Th-that's... I wasn't saying that to you, but to...

117
00:08:43,930 --> 00:08:45,730
I'm sorry.

118
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:47,540
Man...

119
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:06,210
- Hae Yeong.
 - Hm?
 - What are you looking at that's making you smile so much?

120
00:09:06,210 --> 00:09:10,660
I've been going scuba diving with a friend that I met on an app.

121
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,400
I'm looking at the pictures from then.

122
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:15,720
- You met a friend on an app?
 - Yes.

123
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:23,960
You can meet friends who have the same hobbies or interests as you on this app.

124
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:27,090
Why? Are you interested, too?

125
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:32,750
Recently I keep on being distracted. I think it would be nice to concentrate on something else.

126
00:09:32,750 --> 00:09:35,880
Is there anyone who likes the ukelele on there? It would be nice to learn it together.

127
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:41,090
You're searching for a ukelele? I have one that I'm not using.

128
00:09:41,090 --> 00:09:43,810
Do you want to buy it from me?

129
00:09:44,820 --> 00:09:48,690
- What?
 - I'll sell it to you for a bargain price.

130
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,200
I'll bring it here soon.

131
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:54,920
No, it's okay.

132
00:09:55,630 --> 00:09:58,650
I can't keep getting involved with him.

133
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:14,190
By the way, is today a special day or something?

134
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:17,290
Why did you suddenly bring me to a place like this?

135
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:20,060
Because it seemed like we've only been to places with food that wasn't that good

136
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:23,680
or inside the car for our dates, since we've only been searching for places with no people.

137
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,130
I wanted to try to have a proper date like this once.

138
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,230
I see.

139
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:33,090
I was really surprised earlier.

140
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:38,010
Well, honestly, you have a dry side to your personality.

141
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:42,800
So I thought that you wouldn't like showing off secretly in places with a lot of people like that.

142
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,340
You're much better at it than I thought you would be!

143
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:49,290
I also didn't realize that I was someone who is capable of something like that.

144
00:10:49,290 --> 00:10:53,140
But, since you like it.

145
00:10:57,280 --> 00:11:03,080
And, as you said, I wanted to spend the rest of our time well so that it won't go to waste

146
00:11:03,080 --> 00:11:08,630
since there's only a month left where we can enjoy being an in-office couple.

147
00:11:16,670 --> 00:11:18,890
Your plate is empty.

148
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,390
When did I finish eating that?

149
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:29,660
I think that this steak has a problem.

150
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:32,540
The plate is this big, but the meat is only that size.

151
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:37,290
Shouldn't they have at least made the steak fill half the plate?

152
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:40,190
Can't that be passed as a law?

153
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:45,610
I think that it would be hard to pass that as a law, so...

154
00:11:47,030 --> 00:11:48,750
Take this, at least.

155
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,880
I didn't say it to receive this.

156
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,780
No thank you, I'm fine.

157
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:56,960
I'm fine also.

158
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:59,410
Well, then—

159
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:01,370
That's enough, that's enough.

160
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,990
Please eat.

161
00:12:05,580 --> 00:12:08,930
Lately, I'm really happy every day.

162
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:13,650
Of course, the biggest reason is that you're next to me.

163
00:12:13,650 --> 00:12:17,160
Truthfully, on my first day of work at the law firm,

164
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,290
I thought, "Let's endure for just three months."

165
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:22,610
That's what I was thinking.

166
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:27,830
But now, working is fun and having work dinners is fun.

167
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,860
Workshops are so fun also.  Everything is so fun and exciting.

168
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,820
Like the CEO said, you really are like Princess Ann in Roman Holiday.

169
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:40,700
Like how she ran away because she got tired of life in the palace and found happiness in life's little things.

170
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:44,330
You saw Roman Holiday, Mr. Lawyer?

171
00:12:44,330 --> 00:12:47,750
I think I saw it on Masterpiece Theater, but I don't remember it that well.

172
00:12:47,750 --> 00:12:52,030
That's not right.  You should have watched Roman Holiday properly.

173
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:55,350
It's my favorite movie.

174
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:59,530
I have the Roman Holiday Blu-Ray at my house.  Do you want to watch it together?

175
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,300
Tomorrow is Saturday. Come to my house.

176
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,650
Let's do that.

177
00:13:04,650 --> 00:13:07,410
 Wait a minute.  What did I just say? 

178
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:12,180
 Wait a minute.  So, I'm going to Oh Jin Sim's house tomorrow, right? 

179
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:16,490
 What should I do?  I just innocently asked to see a movie together. 

180
00:13:16,490 --> 00:13:19,190
 I just said that I would because she asked me to come over and watch the movie. 

181
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:20,800
 What if she thinks that I have ulterior motives? 

182
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,790
 I'm sure he doesn't, right? 

183
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:30,510
 At times like this, I have to act like nothing's wrong. 

184
00:13:30,510 --> 00:13:33,920
 If not, things could get more awkward. 

185
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,720
Then I'll see you tomorrow.  The movie... will be fun.

186
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,500
-  Yes, I think so. 
 - Right.

187
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:44,810
I get to see Roman Holiday.

188
00:13:57,500 --> 00:14:01,000
You're back?  Did you eat ...

189
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:06,140
What's wrong with him?  Does he have urgent business to take care of?

190
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:16,560
I can't go empty handed.

191
00:14:17,450 --> 00:14:19,440
What should I take?

192
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:31,000
 Going to a girlfriend's house 

193
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,300
 (Rated R: A man's fantasy when he goes to his girlfriend's house) 
 - Ohh, Yeah! 

194
00:14:43,790 --> 00:14:46,130
What the heck.

195
00:14:46,130 --> 00:14:49,420
I'm just going over to watch a movie.

196
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:54,430
It's just that the location is Oh Jin Sim's house and not a movie theater.

197
00:15:03,310 --> 00:15:07,730
♫  I think you who made me feel so distant  ♫

198
00:15:07,730 --> 00:15:12,250
♫  in a warm smile at me who walked together with you  ♫

199
00:15:12,250 --> 00:15:14,460
♫  made me become different  ♫

200
00:15:14,460 --> 00:15:16,650
♫  I think it made me curious  ♫

201
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,150
♫  I'm confused  ♫

202
00:15:21,300 --> 00:15:24,780
♫  It's then when the wind blew  ♫

203
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:27,200
♫  Now I look through another memory  ♫

204
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:32,220
At least he should hear that I live keeping clean.

205
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:36,410
This is the first time that a boyfriend has been in my living space.

206
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:41,470
I'm so nervous!
 ♫  I just wanna be your star for you  ♫

207
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:46,480
♫  It's contained in my hidden feelings  ♫

208
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:51,440
♫  I will show you.  When you have a gloomy and tiring day  ♫

209
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:55,060
♫  I will hug you  ♫

210
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:59,190
♫  I just wanna be your star.  With my heart  ♫

211
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:03,590
♫  Full of shining starlight  ♫

212
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,580
Oh my, what should I do?  He must be here.

213
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:08,900
♫  the dark night of your feeling alone  ♫

214
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,070
Who is it?

215
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:12,110
It's Kwon Jeong Rok. 
♫  I will fill it up  ♫

216
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:14,310
Oh, that's right. 
♫  With my whole heart  ♫

217
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:41,200
- Please come in.
 - Okay.

218
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,970
And this.

219
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:09,470
What is this?

220
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,300
It's a present, since you have insomnia, Oh Jin Sim.

221
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,460
I heard that a glass of wine could help you sleep.

222
00:17:17,460 --> 00:17:21,260
Thank you.  I'm looking forward to tonight.

223
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:23,540
 What did you just say? 

224
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:27,640
 What do you mean, you're looking forward to tonight?  I'm just looking forward to being able to sleep. 

225
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,720
 He didn't take it a different way, did he? 

226
00:17:32,660 --> 00:17:35,680
Yes, you should sleep deeply tonight.

227
00:17:36,290 --> 00:17:39,750
Is it okay if I take it off? 
 Why did I leave out the object? 

228
00:17:39,750 --> 00:17:42,800
 I should have asked if I could take off my outerwear. 

229
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,180
Why would a guy who is a so-called lawyer leave out the object of what I was taking off?

230
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,310
 She didn't possibly think I meant it in a weird way, right? 

231
00:17:50,310 --> 00:17:52,170
I'm talking about my outerwear.  My outerwear.

232
00:17:52,170 --> 00:17:54,400
Yes, of course.

233
00:17:59,390 --> 00:18:01,220
Should I put it here?

234
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,790
Yes.

235
00:18:09,550 --> 00:18:11,630
Your house is very pretty.

236
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:15,230
Then, would you like a house tour?

237
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:23,750
This is the study.

238
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:28,750
This is the space I use most often in the house.

239
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,300
You have a lot of books.

240
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:35,480
Of course.  I like to read.

241
00:18:40,020 --> 00:18:41,710
If someone saw that,

242
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:45,310
they'd think that dust is on it because I never read the book, but that's not true.

243
00:18:45,310 --> 00:18:48,490
I read often, but I just don't clean.

244
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:51,820
I clean often, but don't—

245
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:54,240
No.

246
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:58,050
Let's go to the next room.

247
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,910
This is my bedroom.

248
00:19:08,910 --> 00:19:11,540
Isn't the vanity so pretty?

249
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:13,770
This bed is also totally my style.

250
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:16,590
This design seems common, but it's not.

251
00:19:16,590 --> 00:19:21,420
The headboard height is just right, and the mattress is totally plush.

252
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,540
 What am I doing?  Why am I talking now about the bed in such detail? 

253
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,960
 The mattress is plush, so what?  What about it? 

254
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,880
 It's not like I'm saying that we should lie down together, so what is it? 

255
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,310
 I'm sure he didn't take it that way, right? 

256
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:41,490
 What is this?  Why turn off the lights?  I turned off the bedroom lights. 

257
00:19:41,490 --> 00:19:43,690
 Why did I make a mistake that is so unlike me? 

258
00:19:44,770 --> 00:19:46,610
It was a mistake.

259
00:19:47,680 --> 00:19:50,330
Of course.  I know.

260
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,170
Then should we go to the kitchen?

261
00:20:02,990 --> 00:20:05,450
I'll fill it out and send it to you via email.

262
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,930
If you have any opinions about it, give me an answer back.

263
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,730
Yes.

264
00:20:11,730 --> 00:20:15,680
- Lawyer Dan.
 - What are you doing here on the weekend, Lawyer Choi?

265
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,900
I had to finish preparing for a case.

266
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:19,770
And what about you, Lawyer Dan?

267
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:22,700
I also have work left to do.

268
00:20:23,790 --> 00:20:27,940
This works out well.    I brought the ukulele to give to you.

269
00:20:27,940 --> 00:20:31,420
I'll bring it to your office later.

270
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,810
What the heck was that?  We met at the law firm on the weekend, just the two of us.

271
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,520
This is...

272
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:46,390
Fate.

273
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,550
What do you mean, fate?  Get your head on straight, Dan Moon Hui.

274
00:20:50,550 --> 00:20:52,870
You resolved not to do this.

275
00:21:04,610 --> 00:21:08,160
Lawyer Dan, I brought the ukulele.

276
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,990
How much do I owe you?

277
00:21:10,990 --> 00:21:14,330
It's fine.  Just buy drinks.

278
00:21:14,330 --> 00:21:16,990
- Drinks?
 - Yes.

279
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:20,450
Here you go.

280
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:27,510
I was thankful for you all that time. As if you were me

281
00:21:28,560 --> 00:21:33,200
and I were you, we became united as one

282
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,790
and made those emotional melodies.

283
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:39,300
I won't be able to forget them.

284
00:21:41,280 --> 00:21:46,250
Instead of saying goodbye for the last time, I'll do it through this song.

285
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:31,780
Our time to say goodbye ends here.

286
00:22:32,830 --> 00:22:34,480
Here it is.

287
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,390
Thank you.

288
00:22:36,390 --> 00:22:38,590
Handle it with care.

289
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,850
Do you know how to play the ukulele, Lawyer Dan?

290
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:47,160
Ah, the thing is, I learned briefly in the past.

291
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,390
I know the chord positions.

292
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:56,240
C chord.

293
00:22:56,240 --> 00:22:59,570
F-F-F chord.

294
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:02,360
To start with, your positioning is wrong.

295
00:23:03,890 --> 00:23:05,610
Here.

296
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,990
Here.

297
00:23:07,990 --> 00:23:10,760
Relax your shoulders.

298
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:17,900
And hold the ukelele with care, as if it were a child.

299
00:23:19,330 --> 00:23:21,080
Like this.

300
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:30,470
Dear God!

301
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:33,430
Please allow it!

302
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:36,250
I

303
00:23:36,250 --> 00:23:38,500
want to love him!

304
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:41,480
Lawyer Choi!

305
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:48,620
It seems you watch movies often through your home theater.

306
00:23:48,620 --> 00:23:53,130
- Yes. Because I really like watching movies. 
- Yes.

307
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,370
- One moment. 
- Okay.

308
00:23:59,370 --> 00:24:01,700
Yes, Prosecutor.

309
00:24:01,700 --> 00:24:03,770
Yes.

310
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,960
I have a small problem next Wednesday.

311
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,260
Yes. No, that's not it.

312
00:24:18,290 --> 00:24:20,930
Where did it go? It was definitely here.

313
00:24:22,550 --> 00:24:24,210
Hm?

314
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:35,480
Hey, Oppa. The DVD player is gone. Where did it...?

315
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:37,560
What? You took it to be repaired?

316
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:40,700
You should have told me before you took it!

317
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:45,060
 What? I've always taken care of things that broke in your house myself! 

318
00:24:45,060 --> 00:24:46,680
 Why are you acting like that all of a sudden? 

319
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:49,740
Ah, I... I...

320
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,880
Alright, bye.

321
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:56,500
Are you starting it now?

322
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,250
About that...

323
00:25:01,010 --> 00:25:04,340
- It's not here.
 - What do you mean?

324
00:25:05,480 --> 00:25:07,980
Are you saying that I might find it boring? It's okay.

325
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:10,580
I don't usually enjoy watching movies,

326
00:25:10,580 --> 00:25:14,570
but I'll watch it with an open mind since it's a movie that you like.

327
00:25:14,570 --> 00:25:17,060
That's not it.

328
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:22,020
I'm saying that the DVD player that we could watch it on isn't here.

329
00:25:26,260 --> 00:25:29,580
It's out for repair. I must have forgotten.

330
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,280
Forgot...

331
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:41,470
It's unfortunate, but let's...

332
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:49,930
It's unfortunate, but let's watch it on the laptop.

333
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:52,470
- I'll hurry and download it.
 - I'm okay.

334
00:25:52,470 --> 00:25:54,680
Take your time.

335
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,070
Go ahead.

336
00:26:02,910 --> 00:26:05,530
I've been curious about the trophies since earlier.

337
00:26:05,530 --> 00:26:07,500
Can I take a closer look at them?

338
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:09,410
Of course.

339
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,780
KBC Popularity Award?

340
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:20,520
MBU Hot Issue Star Award, TCM Teen Star Award,

341
00:26:20,520 --> 00:26:22,900
SBS Netizen's Award.

342
00:26:22,900 --> 00:26:26,230
Wow, you got a lot of awards.

343
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:28,270
Yes, I did.

344
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:31,490
Though it's a problem that they're all popularity awards.

345
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,060
Why is that a problem?

346
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,070
Because it's a bit embarrassing that I didn't get even one for my acting and only got them for my popularity.

347
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:45,660
Why is that embarrassing?

348
00:26:45,660 --> 00:26:49,030
Being popular means that people like you a lot.

349
00:26:49,030 --> 00:26:53,520
I think that it's really hard to move someone's heart.

350
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:55,890
I think it's amazing.

351
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:58,050
Is that so?

352
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,250
But if I acted right now,

353
00:27:01,250 --> 00:27:03,930
I think I could do  really  well.

354
00:27:03,930 --> 00:27:05,500
Back then,

355
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:09,100
I didn't know what it felt like to like someone or for my heart to flutter,

356
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:12,380
so I was clueless as to how to express it.

357
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:14,520
But now...

358
00:27:15,510 --> 00:27:19,960
Now, I think I know.

359
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,340
Which drama were you in when that picture was taken?

360
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,460
It's really pretty.

361
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:39,020
This isn't from a drama!

362
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:42,120
I debuted through this chocolate commercial!

363
00:27:42,120 --> 00:27:45,130
Because of this commercial, the chocolates sold out

364
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:49,010
and I was even coined as the chocolate fairy.

365
00:27:49,010 --> 00:27:52,010
You're saying you didn't see this one?

366
00:27:52,010 --> 00:27:56,060
This won't do. This isn't the time to watch Roman Holiday.

367
00:27:56,060 --> 00:28:00,200
- Come here. Right here. Hurry. Hurry!
 - Okay.

368
00:28:10,260 --> 00:28:14,180
Look at that. I'm so pretty and cute, right?

369
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,770
This one, too. I look pretty and pure, right?

370
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:26,920
I'm so pretty. Don't I look so elegant?

371
00:28:27,980 --> 00:28:30,860
Do you want to look at my photobook, too?

372
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:33,940
- Oh, that?
 - Yeah. You want to see it?

373
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,850
I didn't know it back then,

374
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:46,680
but I was pretty.

375
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:48,480
Right?

376
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:54,090
Now that I think about it, you're not giving a reaction. Why?

377
00:28:54,750 --> 00:28:57,920
- What's is it? Am I not pretty?
 - No, you're pretty.

378
00:28:57,920 --> 00:29:00,770
But you're prettier right now.

379
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,510
How you look in front of me right now.

380
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:13,000
Please give me this one.

381
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,810
- This one?
 - Yes.

382
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:18,140
Actually, I want to take them all but I don't think I can.

383
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:21,990
But I have to have this picture.

384
00:29:21,990 --> 00:29:24,840
Well, alright. Take it with you, take it.

385
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,520
- Hey, I'm feeling generous. Pick one more.
 - Okay.

386
00:29:27,520 --> 00:29:32,410
There are many valuable pictures.  Choose carefully. Carefully.

387
00:29:32,410 --> 00:29:35,110
Oh, this one. The chocolate one.

388
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:48,570
It smells good.

389
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:51,110
I'm glad that you like it.

390
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:58,220
But, what should we do? I told you to come over to watch a movie,

391
00:29:58,220 --> 00:30:02,080
but we ended up not being able to watch it. I'm sorry.

392
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,060
I'm actually glad that we weren't able to watch the movie.

393
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,710
- What?
 - Um...

394
00:30:09,610 --> 00:30:12,290
Actually, last night,

395
00:30:12,290 --> 00:30:15,120
I didn't get a wink of sleep

396
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:17,140
because I was so nervous.

397
00:30:17,140 --> 00:30:19,560
When I thought about coming over to your house,

398
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:23,480
it felt unfamiliar and awkward,

399
00:30:23,480 --> 00:30:25,830
and my heart was fluttering, as well.

400
00:30:26,850 --> 00:30:29,120
I was the same.

401
00:30:29,850 --> 00:30:32,950
Since I thought about you coming over,

402
00:30:32,950 --> 00:30:35,260
my heart was pounding and I was so nervous.

403
00:30:35,260 --> 00:30:38,230
I already have insomnia on top of that,

404
00:30:38,230 --> 00:30:41,860
so I really stayed up the entire night last night.

405
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:45,900
I thought that I was the only one who did that.

406
00:30:45,900 --> 00:30:47,730
Yes, I did it as well.

407
00:30:47,730 --> 00:30:50,070
Anyway, I was really nervous,

408
00:30:50,070 --> 00:30:51,960
but looking at those pictures earlier

409
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:54,680
and talking a lot with you made my nervousness go away.

410
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:57,260
You're the same with me in that, too!

411
00:30:57,260 --> 00:31:01,950
I also finally stopped being nervous as we were looking at the pictures.

412
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:04,990
Before that, I was so aware that you were at my house

413
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:07,040
and that we were the only two here,

414
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:10,420
so I was imagining all kinds of things.

415
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:16,910
But that doesn't mean

416
00:31:16,910 --> 00:31:20,740
that I was imagining bad things.

417
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:25,830
When you say imagining bad things, do you possibly mean...?

418
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:28,340
That is... So, that's...

419
00:31:34,470 --> 00:31:36,980
Are you talking about something like this?

420
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:41,280
If not that,

421
00:31:42,210 --> 00:31:44,100
something like this?

422
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,570
Yeah, Oppa?

423
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:17,010
What? You're going to be late? How late?

424
00:32:17,010 --> 00:32:20,050
Oh, okay. Call me when you get here.

425
00:32:20,050 --> 00:32:22,180
Okay.

426
00:32:29,150 --> 00:32:32,370
I had fun with Mr. Lawyer yesterday.

427
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:38,270
Is this why people get married?

428
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:41,410
Because if you're together, you're happy no matter what you do

429
00:32:41,410 --> 00:32:43,910
and you have fun no matter what you do?

430
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:47,480
 Lee Kang Joon, former CEO of Imperial Entertainment, 

431
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:50,100
 who provoked a lot of criticism two years ago for illegal drug use, 

432
00:32:50,100 --> 00:32:55,200
has returned to the forefront as vice president of Imperial Holdings Group.

433
00:32:55,200 --> 00:33:00,920
He said that Imperial Entertainment is not the only company in the group

434
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:05,770
and the group will be restructured so that it manages the affiliates.

435
00:33:05,770 --> 00:33:10,360
 I'm talking about the Vice President of Jegook Group, Lee Gang Joon. He was famous for being involved in a drug scandal with an actress a few years ago. 

436
00:33:10,360 --> 00:33:12,750
 - Was it Oh Yoon Seo?
 - Oh Yoon Seo? 

437
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:16,400
 Lee Gang Joon stalked Oh Yoon Seo, and then because she wouldn't accept his feelings, 

438
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,970
 they say that he called her to a drug party to frame her for drug use. 

439
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:24,360
 In some quarters, there is criticism that Lee Kang Joon is returning so soon. 

440
00:33:24,360 --> 00:33:26,930
 Vice President Lee Gang Joon— 

441
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,810
You're heading to work?

442
00:33:29,580 --> 00:33:33,270
Of course I'm heading to work this early in the morning. I'm off.

443
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:35,410
Hey, wait.

444
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:39,070
Nothing's going on with Yoon Seo, right?

445
00:33:40,980 --> 00:33:43,010
I just asked because I'm curious.

446
00:33:43,010 --> 00:33:45,840
I was wondering if the universe's goddess was doing okay.

447
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:49,860
Yeah, she's doing fine. You head on out too.

448
00:33:49,860 --> 00:33:51,380
Okay.

449
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,880
Hey, CEO. I saw the news, too.

450
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:03,570
They said that Lee Gang Joon is back.

451
00:34:03,570 --> 00:34:05,930
I'm not sure. I don't think anything has happened yet,

452
00:34:05,930 --> 00:34:10,140
and isn't it possible that Yoon Seo doesn't know yet? She's not the type to watch the news.

453
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:14,790
CEO, Yoon Seo is coming now. I'll call you right back. Alright.

454
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:23,250
What is it?

455
00:34:23,250 --> 00:34:26,150
Who were you on the phone with that you rushed to hang up?

456
00:34:26,150 --> 00:34:29,850
No one. I didn't rush to hang it up.

457
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:34,850
- Yoon Seo.
 - Yeah?

458
00:34:36,470 --> 00:34:39,640
- What?
 - Nothing's going on these days, right?

459
00:34:39,640 --> 00:34:42,200
You don't feel like anyone's been loitering around you

460
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,810
or following you around?

461
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:49,910
What's going on? Why are you asking me that so suddenly?

462
00:34:49,910 --> 00:34:51,450
Why would I ask?

463
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:55,190
You're Oh Yoon Seo! You're so pretty that

464
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:57,660
I always feel uneasy. That's why.

465
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:02,570
- Do I look pretty today, too?
 - You're always pretty.

466
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,850
- I'll head on.
 - Okay!

467
00:35:08,860 --> 00:35:12,070
- Bye, Oppa.
 - Okay. Work hard. 
- Okay.

468
00:35:23,460 --> 00:35:26,720
Yes, Mr. Lawyer. Good morning.

469
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:29,680
Ah, the written judgments? Hold on a moment.

470
00:35:33,420 --> 00:35:36,170
Yes, where should I send them?

471
00:35:36,170 --> 00:35:38,440
Yeah. Yes.

472
00:35:38,440 --> 00:35:42,100
I'm in the underground parking lot right now, so I'll send them as soon as I get up there. Don't worry.

473
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:44,060
I'll see you later.

474
00:36:02,540 --> 00:36:04,220
 There's nothing going on these days, right? 

475
00:36:04,220 --> 00:36:09,300
 You don't feel like anyone is loitering around you or following you? 

476
00:36:13,330 --> 00:36:14,950
Excuse me!

477
00:36:17,700 --> 00:36:20,370
Who are you? Why do you keep following me?

478
00:36:20,370 --> 00:36:23,890
Oh, th-that is. I ... that pen ...

479
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,310
You said that you're a fan?

480
00:36:26,310 --> 00:36:28,830
You've got the wrong person. I'm not a celebrity.

481
00:36:28,830 --> 00:36:32,560
I just look somewhat like a celebrity.

482
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,030
One... One moment.

483
00:36:41,730 --> 00:36:45,620
Why do you keep following me? I told you, I'm not a celebrity!

484
00:36:45,620 --> 00:36:48,560
Wait, th-that isn't it!

485
00:36:53,430 --> 00:36:55,260
Goodness.

486
00:36:58,300 --> 00:37:02,490
Hey, Honey? I'm at Jeong Rok's law firm.

487
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,170
Jeong Rok?

488
00:37:04,780 --> 00:37:07,280
He won't pick up the phone.

489
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:10,530
I'm here, so I'll just talk to him in person.

490
00:37:10,530 --> 00:37:12,470
Alright.

491
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:17,650
What brings you here?

492
00:37:17,650 --> 00:37:20,500
I came to meet Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok.

493
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:22,510
If you tell him it's Kwon Jae Book, he'll know who I am.

494
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:25,300
Are you Lawyer Kwon's father?

495
00:37:25,300 --> 00:37:28,100
Yes, how did you guess that so quickly?

496
00:37:28,100 --> 00:37:30,620
I just had a feeling.

497
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:34,580
If you walk straight down that way, you'll get to his office. I'll take you there.

498
00:37:34,580 --> 00:37:37,000
No, it's okay.

499
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:39,760
I'll find it on my own.

500
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:44,540
Sending the judgment statements, complete.

501
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:52,190
How can you follow me all the way here?

502
00:37:52,190 --> 00:37:54,610
I told you, I'm not Oh Yoon Seo!

503
00:37:59,340 --> 00:38:01,880
That's right, I am Oh Yoon Seo.

504
00:38:01,880 --> 00:38:05,060
- Do you feel refreshed now?
 - What?

505
00:38:05,060 --> 00:38:10,340
You said that you're my fan.  I'm asking if you feel refreshed now that you've attacked and cornered me like this.

506
00:38:10,340 --> 00:38:14,390
How in the world did you know that I work here?

507
00:38:14,390 --> 00:38:18,440
How much do you know about me?

508
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:30,590
Look here, young lady. It seems like you've been misunderstanding something since earlier,

509
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,590
but I'm not your fan.

510
00:38:32,590 --> 00:38:35,790
I just picked this pen up and was trying to give it back to you.
  ("Pen" and "fan" sound very similar in Korean) 

511
00:38:35,790 --> 00:38:36,580
What?

512
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:42,110
And I wasn't following you. I came because I had something to say to my son.

513
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:45,440
What do you mean, you had something to say to your son?

514
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:48,970
Isn't this Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok's office?

515
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:52,090
- That's right.
 - That's what I'm saying.

516
00:38:52,090 --> 00:38:55,790
I'm telling you that I came to meet Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok, my son.

517
00:38:55,790 --> 00:38:59,880
So you're Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok's...

518
00:39:03,190 --> 00:39:04,980
Father?!

519
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:09,360
Hello, Father! Oh, my.

520
00:39:15,420 --> 00:39:17,350
Father.

521
00:39:29,930 --> 00:39:32,750
This is killing me, seriously.

522
00:39:32,750 --> 00:39:36,380
How could I make such a mistake toward Mr. Lawyer's father?

523
00:39:49,970 --> 00:39:51,930
What brings you here?

524
00:39:54,030 --> 00:39:56,810
Make sure you dress warmly.

525
00:39:56,810 --> 00:40:00,960
Why is your throat all out in the open? You'll catch a cold like that.

526
00:40:02,260 --> 00:40:06,990
I'm managing my condition very well so that I won't catch a cold.

527
00:40:06,990 --> 00:40:09,540
And call your mom often.

528
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,400
That's something that I'm worrying about in my own way.

529
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,020
You know it. You could just do as I say once.

530
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:17,560
You won't let me have the last word just once.

531
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:25,540
By the way, the more I think about it, the more dumbfounded I feel.

532
00:40:25,540 --> 00:40:29,050
She misunderstood that I was following her around.

533
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:32,840
Your secretary is an impetuous person.

534
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:35,530
It's truly worrisome.

535
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:39,660
Everyone misunderstands and makes mistakes.

536
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:48,690
Did that secretary also do this?

537
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,360
She's not coloring some coloring book.

538
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,800
With the time that she took to color this,

539
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,790
she could have taken care of another work task.

540
00:40:57,790 --> 00:40:59,720
She completes the work that I assign her very well.

541
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:03,540
How have I been thinking wrong?

542
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:06,470
Look at her outfit. Is that something that a worker wears?

543
00:41:06,470 --> 00:41:09,970
Isn't it prejudiced to judge someone based on their outward appearance?

544
00:41:09,970 --> 00:41:11,830
Even so, once you've seen one, you've seen them all.

545
00:41:11,830 --> 00:41:16,180
Father. Tell me why you came here.

546
00:41:16,180 --> 00:41:19,980
Your father has come to see his son. Does there really have to be a reason?

547
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:22,330
This is my place of work.

548
00:41:22,330 --> 00:41:24,990
Because you came looking for me during my work hours,

549
00:41:24,990 --> 00:41:27,160
I thought that you had an urgent reason.

550
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,890
Fine, I get it!

551
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:32,570
I'm sorry I came and disturbed your precious work time.

552
00:41:32,570 --> 00:41:35,470
I should go and take care of my work, too.

553
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:43,840
Excuse me, Father. A cup of coffee... Goodbye.

554
00:41:51,860 --> 00:41:55,130
Why did Father just leave?

555
00:41:55,130 --> 00:41:57,510
He didn't even have any coffee.

556
00:41:58,630 --> 00:42:02,000
Did you two fight?

557
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:04,470
No way... Was it because of me?

558
00:42:05,070 --> 00:42:08,900
No, that's not it. Don't worry about it.

559
00:42:08,900 --> 00:42:11,970
I don't think that's not what happened.

560
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:16,720
He was in a bad mood because of me, wasn't he?

561
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:21,650
My father's personality doesn't mix well with mine, so there's trouble every time we meet.

562
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,870
Though it's not something to be proud of.

563
00:42:23,870 --> 00:42:27,750
So you don't have to worry about him anymore.

564
00:42:35,940 --> 00:42:38,820
Let's put together all the documents we've prepared and indict him.

565
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:40,680
So you've decided to arrest him!

566
00:42:40,680 --> 00:42:42,890
Then shall we go eat lunch?

567
00:42:42,890 --> 00:42:44,850
That sounds good! Let's go eat something good.

568
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:48,740
You worked hard, so go and eat something delicious today.

569
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,670
- Beef ribs? 
- Korean beef!

570
00:42:51,270 --> 00:42:54,340
- Let's do that.
- Yes, this is Prosecutor Kim Se Won's office.

571
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:56,790
Yes, Section Chief.

572
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,320
Sir?

573
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:12,050
Why are you preparing for something unpleasant?

574
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,780
How drastic is the news you're about to tell me?

575
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:21,510
All right.  I'll get right to the point.

576
00:43:21,510 --> 00:43:25,560
About the case with Jeong Ji Ho. Hurry up and finish it.

577
00:43:29,230 --> 00:43:31,490
I want to do that more than anyone else, of course.

578
00:43:31,490 --> 00:43:34,880
So I'm raising my speed little by little.

579
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,120
Now that I've listened closely,

580
00:43:37,120 --> 00:43:39,640
Jeong Ji Ho is a gambler.

581
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:43,860
The evidence is insufficient to prove he was involved in embezzlement or a slush fund.

582
00:43:43,860 --> 00:43:48,300
I think its correct that it is circumstantial evidence of the vice-president's personal corruption.

583
00:43:50,070 --> 00:43:52,120
Is that what's right,

584
00:43:52,120 --> 00:43:55,120
or do I have to make that what's right?

585
00:43:56,200 --> 00:44:01,160
Is this an order to you?

586
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:01,990
What?

587
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:05,990
Choi Yeon Soo, the lawyer leading the defense for Jeong Ji Ho is your brother-in-law.

588
00:44:05,990 --> 00:44:08,070
What's the big deal about that?

589
00:44:08,070 --> 00:44:11,300
The embezzlement is just the individual corruption of the vice-president.

590
00:44:11,300 --> 00:44:13,150
Section Chief!

591
00:44:14,600 --> 00:44:18,560
Section Chief, you remember what you said when I returned, don't you?

592
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,660
You said that if it wasn't a lunatic like me,

593
00:44:21,660 --> 00:44:23,670
then it wouldn't be easy to take care of Jeong Ji Ho's case.

594
00:44:23,670 --> 00:44:25,830
I get what you're saying.

595
00:44:25,830 --> 00:44:27,420
I'm really ashamed of this.

596
00:44:27,420 --> 00:44:30,980
But the obstacle is higher than I thought.

597
00:44:32,130 --> 00:44:34,120
It was difficult for you to come back.

598
00:44:34,120 --> 00:44:38,590
I'm doing this because I feel like you'll also be in danger if you continue.

599
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,980
Mr. Lawyer, did you call your father and see if he made it back okay?

600
00:45:09,980 --> 00:45:13,170
I'm worried that he may not have been able

601
00:45:13,170 --> 00:45:16,020
to tell you what he came here to say because of me.

602
00:45:16,020 --> 00:45:19,290
That's not true. He came for no reason.

603
00:45:19,290 --> 00:45:21,690
That's not true. He definitely told me

604
00:45:21,690 --> 00:45:25,790
that he came because he had something to tell his son earlier.

605
00:45:25,790 --> 00:45:27,560
What?

606
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:34,640
- I'll answer the phone.
 - Okay, then I'll...

607
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,710
Yes, Mother. Just a little while ago, I—

608
00:45:44,510 --> 00:45:47,150
What? Father did?

609
00:45:47,150 --> 00:45:52,790
 Your father, because he revealed that the Deputy Mayor embezzled 2.7 billion won in construction funds, 

610
00:45:52,790 --> 00:45:57,080
 was suspended for three months for violating the Civil Service Act. 

611
00:45:57,080 --> 00:46:00,390
 Your father didn't say anything? 

612
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,480
 He said that he was going to talk to you about it. 

613
00:46:02,500 --> 00:46:05,100
 Deputy Mayor Kim Joon Cheol must retract the unfair punishment 

614
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,080
 Yuyang Municipal Building 

615
00:46:22,070 --> 00:46:24,130
I'm here.

616
00:46:25,260 --> 00:46:28,240
Why did you come here? How did you know?

617
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:29,660
I heard from Mother.

618
00:46:29,660 --> 00:46:32,930
Your mom did something useless again.

619
00:46:32,930 --> 00:46:34,460
You must be busy. Go ahead and leave.

620
00:46:34,460 --> 00:46:37,680
Let's go somewhere and have a cup of coffee.

621
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:40,550
Does it look like it's time for me to drink coffee?

622
00:46:41,380 --> 00:46:45,640
Even if you're  going to protest, do it while taking care of your body.

623
00:46:46,980 --> 00:46:50,770
 Yuyang Municipal Office 

624
00:46:53,630 --> 00:46:56,060
Wait, that rascal!

625
00:47:01,190 --> 00:47:03,630
There's nothing for you to sigh about.

626
00:47:03,630 --> 00:47:07,550
Rather than suffering because I was suspended, I'm thinking it was a fortunate thing.

627
00:47:07,550 --> 00:47:08,550
What do you mean by that?

628
00:47:08,550 --> 00:47:11,840
Despite my revelation of the wrongdoing, nothing has changed.

629
00:47:11,840 --> 00:47:14,950
Everyone's attitude is to take it easy on the job.

630
00:47:14,950 --> 00:47:18,130
But they suspended me from work for three months

631
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:22,060
so I gained a reason to protest.

632
00:47:22,060 --> 00:47:27,560
Isn't this perhaps a better way to let the world know about it?

633
00:47:30,600 --> 00:47:33,600
You submitted an appeal petition, right?

634
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:35,200
When is your court hearing?

635
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,300
Tomorrow.

636
00:47:37,360 --> 00:47:40,570
And if they decide to discipline you?

637
00:47:40,570 --> 00:47:43,290
Then I'll have to file a lawsuit to cancel the disciplinary action.

638
00:47:43,290 --> 00:47:46,020
Is that why you came to the law firm earlier?

639
00:47:47,630 --> 00:47:51,830
So you could ask me to be your lawyer if you ended up getting into a lawsuit?

640
00:47:55,320 --> 00:47:59,210
Then you should have just said that from the start.

641
00:47:59,210 --> 00:48:03,540
Are you offering to take my side so I could say that you did?

642
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:08,450
Still, did you have to just leave? You just make me into the bad son.

643
00:48:19,260 --> 00:48:22,520
So that's what happened.

644
00:48:23,560 --> 00:48:25,790
He must have already been having a difficult time,

645
00:48:25,830 --> 00:48:29,050
and, of all things, I just had to make a mistake like this.

646
00:48:31,550 --> 00:48:34,160
Don't worry too much about it. It's not that big a deal.

647
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:37,840
Even if he does get disciplinary action, it'll end when he files the lawsuit to cancel it.

648
00:48:37,840 --> 00:48:40,340
I'll turn things back to how they're supposed to be no matter what it takes,

649
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,280
so you don't have to worry about it anymore.

650
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:47,570
I'm telling you, it's okay.

651
00:48:47,570 --> 00:48:51,460
No, that's it's own matter.

652
00:48:51,460 --> 00:48:56,410
But I'm worried that I may have gotten on his bad side.

653
00:48:56,410 --> 00:49:02,150
Anyway, I'm sure he's concerned that he is meeting a celebrity who unfortunately has experienced a lot of criticism.

654
00:49:02,830 --> 00:49:05,970
I ruined his first impression of me like that.

655
00:49:10,800 --> 00:49:13,230
There's nothing for you to be upset about.

656
00:49:14,200 --> 00:49:18,530
No one could dislike you after they find out what kind of person you are.

657
00:49:18,530 --> 00:49:22,350
Do you think you won various TV popularity awards for nothing?

658
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:33,470
Ah, then is your father going to his court hearing alone tomorrow?

659
00:49:33,470 --> 00:49:37,140
Yes. Father will  talk about his principles

660
00:49:37,140 --> 00:49:39,590
and he will go there and hear the disposition of his discipline.

661
00:49:39,590 --> 00:49:42,350
So I don't think there's a need for me to attend.

662
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:45,290
I see.

663
00:49:45,290 --> 00:49:50,640
Wait. Your father will probably be nervous if he goes in all alone.

664
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:56,700
What? You're telling me to go to my father's hearing?

665
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:00,390
No matter how I think about it, I think that your father will be really nervous if he goes by himself,

666
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:05,410
so I think that it would be good for you as his son and a lawyer to attend.

667
00:50:05,450 --> 00:50:10,120
I cleared your morning schedule, so hurry and go.

668
00:50:10,120 --> 00:50:14,440
I'm thankful for the thought, but you're saying that because you don't know my father very well.

669
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:17,210
My father is not someone to get nervous over something like this.

670
00:50:17,210 --> 00:50:19,540
He's much more mentally strong than me.

671
00:50:19,540 --> 00:50:22,050
That's what you think, Mr. Lawyer.

672
00:50:22,050 --> 00:50:26,040
No matter how strong he may be, he's in an unfamiliar situation right now.

673
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:28,430
He could be unusually nervous

674
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:32,330
and you never know if he needs someone to lean on.

675
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:40,720
Just go one time! Ah, seriously.

676
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:46,890
It's because I feel so uneasy thinking that you two may have fought because of me.

677
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:51,010
So please think of me and just go once. Okay?

678
00:50:51,010 --> 00:50:53,920
Yes, well.

679
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,750
Then, head on!

680
00:50:57,890 --> 00:51:00,680
Ah. Here.

681
00:51:00,680 --> 00:51:03,830
Take this with you. It's a calming medicine.

682
00:51:03,830 --> 00:51:07,040
It's an old item that doesn't really suit my image,

683
00:51:07,080 --> 00:51:10,110
but it gets rid of nervousness when you drink it.

684
00:51:10,110 --> 00:51:12,940
Then, be careful on your way.

685
00:51:12,940 --> 00:51:16,790
Take off! Alright, let's go!

686
00:51:47,250 --> 00:51:50,420
I'm here.

687
00:51:50,420 --> 00:51:52,390
Why did you come?

688
00:51:54,370 --> 00:51:58,230
Because my appointment was canceled, so I just came.

689
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:01,590
You must have more free time than I thought.

690
00:52:03,860 --> 00:52:09,720
I've prepared a position statement so there shouldn't be any serious problems.

691
00:52:17,420 --> 00:52:20,130
Even if you possibly get disciplinary action and go with a lawsuit,

692
00:52:20,170 --> 00:52:22,590
I'm sure we will obtain a favorable decision,

693
00:52:22,630 --> 00:52:25,150
so don't worry too much.

694
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,740
I'm not worried.

695
00:52:28,740 --> 00:52:31,280
Of course you should do that.

696
00:52:38,380 --> 00:52:42,810
I have some calming medicine. Shall I give it to you?

697
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,750
Sure, if you've got it.

00:53:50,060 --> 00:53:52,490
Yes, Mr. Lawyer. What happened?

708
00:53:52,490 --> 00:53:55,490
It was decided that he would be suspended from work for three months.

709
00:53:55,530 --> 00:53:56,770
Man.

710
00:53:57,710 --> 00:54:00,890
I think we'll have to start preparing for a lawsuit right away.

711
00:54:00,900 --> 00:54:06,840
And, as you said, I think that it was good for me to be here with Father today.

712
00:54:06,840 --> 00:54:10,190
I think the calming medicine that you prepared helped him, too.

713
00:54:10,190 --> 00:54:12,140
Thank you for worrying about him.

714
00:54:12,140 --> 00:54:14,780
No, don't mention it.

715
00:54:14,820 --> 00:54:19,590
Comfort your father well. Don't pick at him for no reason.

716
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:22,510
Buy him some delicious lunch so that he can regain his energy.

717
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:24,770
And...

718
00:54:24,770 --> 00:54:32,300
And if you can slip it in there that I'm the one who gave him the calming medicine, do that too.

719
00:54:32,300 --> 00:54:35,220
Okay, I will.

720

 Evidence
  Newspaper Survey of Prisoners 

721
00:54:57,460 --> 00:54:59,560
I'm on my way back from meeting the section chief.

722
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:02,340
Why? Did he tell you to try and stop me?

723
00:55:03,180 --> 00:55:07,510
I'm telling you this in advance because I think you'll waste time pointlessly, but I'll refuse any persuasion.

724
00:55:08,440 --> 00:55:10,590
What are you going to do if you really get targeted because of this?

725
00:55:10,660 --> 00:55:14,540
It hasn't even been that long since you came back, but if you continue like this, Sunbae, you'll really—

726
00:55:14,540 --> 00:55:17,400
I'm sure I told you that I refuse to be persuaded.

727
00:55:54,780 --> 00:55:58,270
Don't think of calling it even with this. Pay your debt back properly.

728
00:55:58,270 --> 00:56:02,210
Don't worry. I'm not that conscienceless.

729
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:10,560
But what's going on?

730
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:13,500
Is something wrong?

731
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:22,630
Yoo Yeo Reum, give me a hug once.

732
00:56:23,720 --> 00:56:26,250
What are you saying?

733
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:36,290
It's just... right now,

734
00:56:37,990 --> 00:56:41,780
I wish you would comfort me.

735
00:57:23,670 --> 00:57:27,070
Here. This is the mixed coffee that you like.

736
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:28,840
Thank you.

737
00:57:28,910 --> 00:57:31,520
Are preparations for the lawsuit going well?

738
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,210
Yes.

739
00:57:33,210 --> 00:57:36,690
At first, I honestly thought that my father was peculiar,

740
00:57:36,690 --> 00:57:41,280
but the more that I look into the documents, the more I understand why he did what he did.

741
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:44,690
Even if it's troublesome and he gets called peculiar,

742
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:47,250
it's right to set something that's wrong straight.

743
00:57:47,250 --> 00:57:51,150
That's right. I also think that Father is amazing.

744
00:57:51,190 --> 00:57:55,800
Even if he knew something like that, it wouldn't have been easy for him to reveal the truth.

745
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:59,450
I really admire his sense of justice.

746
00:57:59,450 --> 00:58:04,440
So you should be good to that admirable father of yours in the future.

747
00:58:05,520 --> 00:58:08,500
And if you get the chance, you can kind of slip it in

748
00:58:08,500 --> 00:58:13,870
that I advised you to be good to your father.

749
00:58:13,870 --> 00:58:17,920
Are you that worried about that? That you may have gotten on my father's bad side?

750
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:22,480
Of course. I'm worried about it, of course.

751
00:58:23,650 --> 00:58:27,270
Alright. I'll make sure I tell him.

752
00:58:37,050 --> 00:58:42,160
 This person here is my father, my client, and a government employee. 

753
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:47,110
 In his experience of over thirty years, he has never received disciplinary action even once. 

754
00:58:47,110 --> 00:58:49,780
 Such a civil servant on the verge of retirement, 

755
00:58:49,780 --> 00:58:55,340
 for raising suspicion of his immediate supervisor's acceptance of  2.7 billion won in bribes 

756
00:58:55,370 --> 00:58:58,100
 unjustly received a three-month suspension from work. 

757
00:58:58,100 --> 00:59:03,970
Your Honor, public officials are responsible for the Civil Service Code which places the public as first priority.

758
00:59:03,980 --> 00:59:08,350
It is a given that the responsibility is fulfilled through transparency and impartiality.

759
00:59:08,370 --> 00:59:13,080
Article 15 of the Whistleblowers Protection Act stipulates  that no unreasonable action shall be taken

760
00:59:13,080 --> 00:59:17,870
against an employee for making a report in the public interest.

761
00:59:17,870 --> 00:59:22,310
Isn't that a legal definition of the justice which is spoken of in so many laws?

762
00:59:22,310 --> 00:59:27,110
Your Honor, I ask for your wise decision.

763
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:30,050
That is all.

764
00:59:51,150 --> 00:59:52,760
You worked hard.

765
00:59:52,760 --> 00:59:54,450
It's nothing.

766
00:59:55,520 --> 00:59:57,040
One moment.

767
00:59:59,600 --> 01:00:03,330
 Mr. Lawyer, you were really cool today. 

768
01:00:03,330 --> 01:00:07,270
 Your father was probably very proud of you, too. 

769
01:00:07,270 --> 01:00:13,130
 I'll head back first, so have a good lunch with your father before you come back. 

770
01:00:13,130 --> 01:00:16,740
- Let's go get something to eat.
 - Yeah, sure.

771
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:20,390
With my secretary, Oh Jin Sim, too.

772
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:24,050
That's okay, right?

773
01:00:30,720 --> 01:00:32,080
What's this?

774
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:35,400
Why is he suddenly asking me to eat lunch with him and his father?

775
01:00:35,400 --> 01:00:39,760
It's my last chance to redeem my disgrace in front of his father, right?

776
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:46,050
I already carefully chose a dignified black outfit before coming.

777
01:00:46,090 --> 01:00:49,190
Are my lips too bright pink?

778
01:00:54,970 --> 01:00:59,100
Let's act in a really dignified and cautious manner today!

779
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:02,210
Dignified and cautious!

780
01:01:03,850 --> 01:01:06,640
This isn't the feeling.

781
01:01:21,580 --> 01:01:26,550
I realized then that the root of the problem is the corruption of public officials.

782
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:30,560
You can't solve anything by punishing the workers below you.

783
01:01:31,670 --> 01:01:37,120
The current form of disciplinary action is a very empty system.

784
01:01:37,120 --> 01:01:38,720
That's right.

785
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:46,480
I think it's the result of a Pollyanna-ish administration which is like a needlessly elegant ornament.

786
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:50,180
So it's a vicious cycle revolving around and around.

787
01:01:50,180 --> 01:01:53,390
It's crazy for me to get so angry, isn't it?

788
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:59,840
Ah, I'm sorry for talking about something so boring just between us two.

789
01:01:59,840 --> 01:02:02,910
No, it's interesting.

790
01:02:02,910 --> 01:02:05,550
Tell him truthfully that it's boring.

791
01:02:05,550 --> 01:02:08,700
It's not, I told you. It really is interesting.

792
01:02:11,230 --> 01:02:17,710
Ah, right. I have something to tell you that Oh Jin Sim asked me to lightly mention to you.

793
01:02:20,630 --> 01:02:23,560
During your hearing, she canceled all of my morning appointments

794
01:02:23,560 --> 01:02:27,900
so that I could be with you and pushed me to go.

795
01:02:27,900 --> 01:02:31,860
She also bought the calming medicine and gave it to me.

796
01:02:31,860 --> 01:02:34,210
She said that your sense of justice is admirable

797
01:02:34,210 --> 01:02:39,400
and even advised me to be good to you.

798
01:02:40,210 --> 01:02:41,640
Mr. Lawyer.

799
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:45,850
She's a very thoughtful and good person.

800
01:02:45,850 --> 01:02:50,120
So I really like her.

801
01:02:50,200 --> 01:02:52,710
Please take care of

802
01:02:52,710 --> 01:02:54,800
my girlfriend.

803
01:03:04,420 --> 01:03:08,220
Is this something to be that surprised over?

804
01:03:08,220 --> 01:03:10,300
Of course!

805
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:13,700
Someone who never did this before in his life suddenly confessed his love in front of his father.

806
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,430
Would I be in my right mind or not?

807
01:03:16,430 --> 01:03:19,100
You're right. I'm so taken aback right now.

808
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:21,910
Right? I'm not the only one taken aback right now, right?

809
01:03:21,910 --> 01:03:26,920
Yes, sir. You know your son's personality better than anyone. Is he the type to do something like that?

810
01:03:26,920 --> 01:03:29,630
That's what I'm saying.

811
01:03:31,170 --> 01:03:34,050
Your name is Oh Jin Sim, right?

812
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:36,750
Yes.

813
01:03:38,200 --> 01:03:40,980
Since he's doing things that he's never done in his life before,

814
01:03:40,980 --> 01:03:45,240
it seems that this guy sincerely likes you, Miss Jin Sim.

815
01:03:46,430 --> 01:03:51,130
My son is probably lacking in many ways, but please take care of him.

816
01:03:51,130 --> 01:03:56,560
Oh, no. He's perfect and doesn't lack anything.

817
01:03:56,560 --> 01:04:03,170
I will definitely make your precious son happy, so please don't worry.

818
01:04:13,780 --> 01:04:16,520
- Eat, Father.
 - Let's eat.

819
01:04:19,590 --> 01:04:22,320
I was really surprised.

820
01:04:22,320 --> 01:04:25,890
Who would have thought that you would say that so directly to your father?

821
01:04:25,890 --> 01:04:28,980
- Were you really embarrassed?
 - Embarrassed?

822
01:04:28,980 --> 01:04:31,070
I was more touched than embarrassed.

823
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:35,470
I was the one who was touched because you worried about what was going on with my father and me.

824
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:40,150
My father and I both are really prideful,

825
01:04:40,150 --> 01:04:43,840
so if we argue once, we don't contact each other for several months.

826
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,660
My mother was always in the middle and suffered because of it.

827
01:04:46,690 --> 01:04:51,230
But this time, we made up quickly thanks to you.

828
01:04:51,230 --> 01:04:55,030
- My father was probably also really thankful.
 - Really?

829
01:04:56,130 --> 01:05:00,340
Mr. Lawyer, I really love that we're an office couple.

830
01:05:00,340 --> 01:05:02,860
I felt it even more greatly this time.

831
01:05:02,900 --> 01:05:06,490
Since we're at the same company, I was able to meet your father coincidentally

832
01:05:06,490 --> 01:05:09,760
and I was able to make you two make up like this.

833
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:13,590
And I also was able to be acknowledged by your father in the end.

834
01:05:13,590 --> 01:05:16,790
Anyway, I like everything. Everything.

835
01:05:22,260 --> 01:05:25,320
Oh Jin Sim.

836
01:05:27,880 --> 01:05:33,090
♫  When your eyes and lips  ♫

837
01:05:33,100 --> 01:05:37,200
What is this? 
♫  are saying something different to me   ♫

838
01:05:37,200 --> 01:05:40,000
It's so pretty!

839
01:05:42,360 --> 01:05:44,740
- Why did you...? 
- It's a gift.

840
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:50,510
A gift? Did you get it because I helped you two make up?

841
01:05:50,510 --> 01:05:55,410
It's not that. I just wanted to do this for you. 
♫  You who were always waiting for me  ♫

842
01:05:55,410 --> 01:06:00,820
♫  don't have to wait now  ♫

843
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:08,230
♫  To the extent you and I struggled  ♫

844
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:14,090
♫  you and I fought hard  ♫

845
01:06:14,100 --> 01:06:16,100
It's pretty.

846
01:06:16,100 --> 01:06:17,700
The necklace?

847
01:06:17,700 --> 01:06:19,700
No. Both.

848
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,600
The necklace and you, Oh Jin Sim.

849
01:06:21,600 --> 01:06:25,000
♫  We don't have to care anymore about the early morning ♫    

850
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:30,000
♫  Now it's a comfortable Good Night   ♫

851
01:06:51,490 --> 01:06:54,320
It seems you really like it.

852
01:06:54,320 --> 01:06:56,690
Yes. It's pretty no matter how much I look at it.

853
01:06:56,690 --> 01:06:58,450
Thank you so much, Mr. Lawyer.

854
01:06:58,450 --> 01:07:02,890
I'm the one who's thankful since you like it that much, Oh Jin Sim.

855
01:07:04,140 --> 01:07:08,220
By the way, there's something I'm curious about.

856
01:07:08,220 --> 01:07:11,550
Mr. Lawyer, why do you keep calling me Oh Jin Sim?

857
01:07:11,550 --> 01:07:13,880
Even though I've corrected you so much and said that I go by Oh Yoon Seo.

858
01:07:13,880 --> 01:07:19,320
At first, I thought that the name Oh Yoon Seo was an alias you used as a celebrity,

859
01:07:19,320 --> 01:07:23,780
so you should use your real name if you came to work. That's why I called you that then.

860
01:07:23,820 --> 01:07:27,870
But now that I think about that, I think it's good that I called you that.

861
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:28,590
What?

862
01:07:28,590 --> 01:07:32,800
Because I'm the only person who calls you Oh Jin Sim.

863
01:07:34,510 --> 01:07:36,100
That's right. Well.

864
01:07:36,100 --> 01:07:38,020
If that's the case, I like it too.

865
01:07:38,060 --> 01:07:41,580
Because you're the only person who calls me that.

866
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:45,030
No matter where I am, if I hear the words Oh Jin Sim,

867
01:07:45,040 --> 01:07:48,040
I'll know that it's you right away.

868
01:08:01,320 --> 01:08:07,280
But I think that black car behind us has been following us since earlier.

869
01:08:09,930 --> 01:08:12,700
They probably haven't, right?

870
01:08:35,560 --> 01:08:40,150
What is that? Is he really following us?

871
01:09:13,200 --> 01:09:16,020
Are you okay, Oh Jin Sim?

872
01:09:36,870 --> 01:09:39,400
Don't get out, Mr. Lawyer.

873
01:09:54,780 --> 01:09:57,250
What is this?

874
01:10:15,430 --> 01:10:21,250


875
01:10:23,910 --> 01:10:31,280
♫  To the extent you and I struggled  ♫

876
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:35,630
♫  we  fought hard   ♫

877
01:10:35,630 --> 01:10:38,980
♫  Even being angry, we did a lot  ♫

878
01:10:38,980 --> 01:10:44,640
♫  We don't have to care anymore  ♫

879
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:48,160
♫  about the early morning  ♫

880
01:10:48,160 --> 01:10:53,260
♫  Now it's a comfortable Good Night  ♫

881
01:10:56,140 --> 01:10:59,370
♫  I'm probably going to get very tired  ♫
