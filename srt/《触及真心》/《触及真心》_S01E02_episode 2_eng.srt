1
00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:04,530


2
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:41,260
 Touch Your Heart 

3
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:52,010
Excuse me.

4
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:55,830
Mr. Lawyer,

5
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:01,540
do you perhaps, not like women?

6
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:06,200
- What? 
 - I mean,

7
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:08,060
Men...

8
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:12,690
Do you dislike women?

9
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,350
This might be disappointing to your wayward imagination.

10
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,890
What are you doing?

11
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:22,800
I,

12
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:28,070
like women. A lot.

13
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,240
I  totally like women.

14
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:34,990
Except,

15
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,190
I have zero interest in you, Oh Jin Sim.

16
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:45,680
Then will you please leave now.

17
00:01:49,670 --> 00:01:51,910
Excuse me!

18
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:58,490
If you like women that much, let me give you a piece of advice.

19
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:04,130
Please fix your personality. What woman would like such a cranky character?

20
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:09,390
I won't ask you to like me, so don't worry.

21
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:11,880
Ha, who's worrying?

22
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,730
I hope you'll stick to those words!

23
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:19,830
- Why? You don't have confidence? 
 - Not confidence, I don't have time.

24
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,480
Since I now have to find the documents you lost, Oh Jin Sim.

25
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,620
I said it's Oh Yoon Seo. Oh Yoon Seo!

26
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:43,160
Oh Yoon Seo, we're having your welcome party this evening—

27
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:48,510
- Did I do something wrong? 
 - I think she's like that because she fought with Lawyer Kwon.

28
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:51,780
Why? Do they not get along?

29
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:56,090
- How would I know that? 
 - So why would you think they fought?

30
00:02:56,090 --> 00:02:58,290
Just because.

31
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:02,130
What?

32
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,740
 Episode 2 

33
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:12,940
Kwon Jeong Rok, you jerk!

34
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:19,060
You mannerless *ssh*le!

35
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:22,290
You are so freakin' mean!

36
00:03:25,420 --> 00:03:28,220
Oh, it's so cold.

37
00:03:29,690 --> 00:03:35,290
Ms. Vivien said in Gone With the Wind.

38
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:40,320
"After all, tomorrow is another day."

39
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:47,970
It's so freezing. I really want to disappear with the wind.

40
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:52,010
Lawyer Kwon, what are you doing? Looking for something?

41
00:03:52,010 --> 00:03:54,260
It's nothing.

42
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:59,880
Did you perhaps fight with Yoon Seo?

43
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:01,850
- There was nothing like that. 
 - Figures.

44
00:04:01,850 --> 00:04:05,520
What could there be to fight about with a great secretary like Yoon Seo?

45
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:08,860
Lawyer Kwon, you know I don't acknowledge many people, right?

46
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,260
But I acknowledge Yoon Seo.

47
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:14,130
Looks, personality, they're all totally perfect.

48
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:18,630
A person like that suits my perfection better than you, Lawyer Kwon.

49
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:21,640
Doesn't it seem like the president mismatched you two?

50
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:23,310
Did you come to say that?

51
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:27,550
Look at me. I wanted to return this. It was very helpful.

52
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:30,640
Why do you have this?!

53
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:35,450
I told you I'd borrow it to look at it briefly ...

54
00:04:35,450 --> 00:04:40,570
Right! I thought I'd tell you when you were back, but it slipped my mind!

55
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:44,910
Why are you taking someone's else things without even a word?

56
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,540
Oh, sorry, sorry. I needed to request  a preliminary injunction to preserve asset titles.

57
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:55,080
I looked at it as a reference briefly.  I didn't ask you first because I was so busy.

58
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:59,850
Because of my busy-ness, please overlook the minor slip in etiquette between us modern men.

59
00:05:04,770 --> 00:05:07,050
 Application for Temporary Injunction to Prohibit Transfer of Real Property 

60
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,430
 (TN. Attorney Choi, a divorce lawyer, wants  to prevent the spouses from moving assets to other people's names.) 

61
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:23,860
 3. Tidy up the desk! 

62
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:35,350
I have a meeting with a client after court, so I'll leave  work right after.

63
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,400
Do that then.

64
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,860
And,

65
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,260
I'm sorry.

66
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,050
For what?

67
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:50,500
The document  you lost, Oh Jin Sim— No, the document  I thought   you lost,

68
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:52,740
Lawyer Choi took and had it.

69
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,390
What?

70
00:05:54,390 --> 00:05:56,910
Sorry for not searching properly before blaming you.

71
00:05:56,910 --> 00:06:02,860
Wait a minute. It wasn't my fault, but yours.

72
00:06:02,860 --> 00:06:05,020
- Is that it? 
 - Yes.

73
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,800
- Apologies- 
 - Is a sorry enough?

74
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:12,820
The pain's already been inflicted, is an apology the end?

75
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:16,950
Right.  If the document was that important, you should've looked after it.

76
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:20,560
Why would you lose it and find another to blame it on?

77
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:26,730
I hope you won't be so hasty in the future.

78
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:31,100
Be thankful, not cranky, if I clean the desk.

79
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:37,730
That's not it. I apologize for my carelessness, but my desk is organized in a specific way,

80
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:41,520
so please don't touch it in the future. Well then.

81
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,720
Well then?

82
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:48,730
What is this? Is he apologizing or starting an argument?

83
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:53,550
Lawyer Kwon, you're coming to Yoon Seo's welcome party today, right?

84
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:55,880
I told you I have an appointment with my client.

85
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:59,380
Does it make sense for you not to come? It's welcoming your personal secretary.

86
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:03,110
Who's the one that decided without even asking about my schedule?

87
00:07:03,110 --> 00:07:07,700
That's me. But then, even if you didn't have an appointment, I wouldn't have asked because you won't be coming anyway.

88
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:13,220
If you don't come, Yoon Seo's going to be really disappointed! You have to come.

89
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:20,510
Wait! Sir, please listen.

90
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,170
Enough! Are you the only lawyer?

91
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:26,650
Who are you making a criminal here?

92
00:07:26,650 --> 00:07:29,590
Sir!

93
00:07:31,820 --> 00:07:34,920
I'm sorry, President Yeon. That person

94
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,710
didn't want to pay taxes despite having a lot of money, so my sense of justice was ignited.

95
00:07:39,710 --> 00:07:42,720
You did well, a sense of justice is important.

96
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:47,800
What if we don't earn much money? I will be just behind on my rent, that's all. I couldn't take care of the law firm's building but we upheld justice.

97
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:50,690
You did well. You know what I'm saying?

98
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:52,760
You did well.

99
00:07:57,410 --> 00:08:01,620
At the least, I'm sure the evidence is enough and I think 15 years would be a reasonable request.

100
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,040
Good, make sure to clear it up.

101
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,640
Yes.

102
00:08:06,640 --> 00:08:10,090
Department Head, about the woman who killed her husband,

103
00:08:10,090 --> 00:08:14,030
please give the case to me. I will make sure to get her the verdict of imprisonment.

104
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,260
What is it?

105
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:20,890
She stabbed him to death, and her previous husband was caught in a fire. Something's fishy.

106
00:08:20,890 --> 00:08:23,780
Maybe, her ex-husband was murdered, too.

107
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:27,140
What's your basis for thinking that?

108
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:34,090
I read the investigation journal. It seems like she could be a femme fatale.

109
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,620
I hear Kim Se Won is returning?

110
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:39,070
He's starting tomorrow. You didn't hear?

111
00:08:39,070 --> 00:08:41,140
Don't you talk after breaking up?

112
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:43,460
Don't cause a problem.

113
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:49,300
I don't care what you do anymore, but I won't tolerate embarrassment in front of the prosecution a second time.

114
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:52,390
Yes, I'm sorry.

115
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,920
 First floor. 

116
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,770
- It's been a while. 
 - Yeah.

117
00:09:42,050 --> 00:09:46,700
I heard the news. You're back to working here.

118
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,840
Yeah, it happened that way.

119
00:09:51,190 --> 00:09:54,320
- Have you been well? 
 - Thanks to you.

120
00:09:58,310 --> 00:10:01,770
- Are you on your way back from seeing the department head?
 - Yeah.

121
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:06,190
- Lunch? 
 - I ate.

122
00:10:06,190 --> 00:10:10,050
You'll have to eat a lot, you're skinny.

123
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:22,900
Welcome party? Do you have to go there?

124
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,070
If you make a mistake after getting drunk there—

125
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:32,250
Don't worry. I'll drink in moderation. I can't not drink at my own welcome party.

126
00:10:32,250 --> 00:10:34,140
Anyway, I'll call you when it's done.

127
00:10:34,140 --> 00:10:38,100
Okay. I'll be on standby around there so call me.

128
00:10:38,100 --> 00:10:41,570
- And be careful with alcohol. 
 - I said I got it.

129
00:10:41,570 --> 00:10:45,030
Oppa, I'm Oh Yoon Seo.

130
00:10:45,030 --> 00:10:49,140
Are you worried I might fall for someone while drunk?

131
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:55,110
I'm going to be elegant and stay aloof, so don't worry.

132
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:06,300
So that's why I'm saying, I'm just going to try to do well.

133
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:10,710
I cleaned up his desk because I really wanted to help him.

134
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:12,220
You know that, right, Secretary Yang?

135
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:16,310
Huh? Ah, of course, I know that you tried hard.

136
00:11:16,310 --> 00:11:19,630
Yoon Seo, I think you drank too much.

137
00:11:19,630 --> 00:11:26,060
But Lawyer Kwon got all mad and looked down on me.

138
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,700
Does he perhaps have intermittent explosive disorder?

139
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,780
Mm-hmm. He does have that kind of side.

140
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:36,830
Earlier, I made a really small and human-like mistake.

141
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,440
But he was way too serious about it.

142
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,060
- Right? That's what I'm saying!
 - Right?

143
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:45,540
That's right.

144
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:52,430
But why isn't Lawyer Kwon coming?

145
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:57,070
I really need to... talk to him.

146
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,030
She's crashed.

147
00:12:01,030 --> 00:12:04,160
What should we do? I think she drank too much.

148
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,870
We should just wait until she wakes up. What else can we do?

149
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,790
By the way, what should we do for our Yoon Seo?

150
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:11,820
I think that she's clashing with Lawyer Kwon a lot.

151
00:12:11,820 --> 00:12:13,850
CEO, this is what I was saying.

152
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:17,140
If you would have sent her to me from the start, this wouldn't have happened.

153
00:12:17,140 --> 00:12:20,520
I could teach Yoon Seo how to work and help her to adjust.

154
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:23,480
- And become a couple.
 - And we could become a couple.

155
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,680
What is with you, Lawyer Dan?

156
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,220
I'm sorry! It just seemed like you were interested in her.

157
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:32,320
Well, it's not like I'm not interested in her.

158
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,720
Why are you interested in her? Why are you interested in our Yoon Seo? How dare you.

159
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,230
What do you mean, how dare I? What's wrong with me?

160
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,120
I'm handsome, personable, physically fit, and competent.

161
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:42,710
And what's more,  I'm a filial son and ...

162
00:12:42,710 --> 00:12:44,460
- A mama's boy.
 - I'm a mama's boy!

163
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:46,260
Ah, are you trying to pick a fight with me right now, Lawyer Dan?!

164
00:12:46,260 --> 00:12:49,980
No, I'm not good at fighting. I'm sorry.

165
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:52,130
Ah, seriously...

166
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:58,190
But will things be okay like this between Lawyer Kwon and Yoon Seo?

167
00:12:58,190 --> 00:13:02,930
But when I looked at the gossip, Yoon Seo is also the type to get angry really quickly.

168
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:05,490
So won't things get totally messed up later?

169
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,900
Don't worry. Before something troubling like that happens,

170
00:13:07,900 --> 00:13:11,850
it is my job as the CEO to spot those kinds of things in advance. So don't worry about it.

171
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:14,700
Ah, but why isn't Lawyer Kwon coming?

172
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,810
Lawyer Kwon is here?

173
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:18,830
You're here?

174
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:25,110
Lawyer Kwon?

175
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,530
Why do you look like that? It must because you get angry too much,

176
00:13:30,530 --> 00:13:33,700
but your face is getting scarier and scarier.

177
00:13:43,650 --> 00:13:47,840
So I think that it would be better to settle instead of filing a lawsuit.

178
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:50,580
Ah, that's probably true.

179
00:13:50,580 --> 00:13:54,520
As you know, I'm a big fish.

180
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,840
It's also burdensome for me to file a lawsuit over such a small problem.

181
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:01,710
But what should I do? Because of that bull crap,

182
00:14:01,710 --> 00:14:06,630
my kid can't concentrate on his studies and is failing college.

183
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:08,350
Really?

184
00:14:09,390 --> 00:14:11,860
This is his 4th time. If he fails again—

185
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:13,910
I'm sorry. But if that's all for today...

186
00:14:13,910 --> 00:14:15,650
Why? Ah!

187
00:14:16,390 --> 00:14:18,880
Have a drink before you go, My Lawyer.

188
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:23,280
It is my principle to not drink with my clients.  And also...

189
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:25,240
 CEO  Yeon Joon Gyoo 

190
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:28,960
I will find a point of compromise soon with the opposing lawyer.

191
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:31,490
Alright. So just have one glass.

192
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:35,840
I'm sorry. I will leave first today. Then.

193
00:14:36,920 --> 00:14:38,860
Alright, I got it.

194
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:42,740
But, Your Highness Mom, what do you think about having a celebrity as a daughter-in-law?

195
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:45,630
What? You said not over your dead body?

196
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:49,150
Ah, Mom. Mom, why are you so extreme?

197
00:14:49,150 --> 00:14:51,390
Give me your permission, please!

198
00:14:53,990 --> 00:14:56,560
Then I'll see you at home, Mother.

199
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:01,840
Are you going for the second round now? Then what about the wine bar across the street?

200
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:05,540
Let's go home. Everyone is tired and Yoon Seo is really drunk.

201
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:08,330
It's disappointing for us to part like this.

202
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,750
But where is Yoon Seo?

203
00:15:09,750 --> 00:15:13,670
Ah, right now, with her manager... No, what is he? Her relative oppa.

204
00:15:13,670 --> 00:15:16,730
She's on the phone with her relative oppa. He's going to come pick her up right now. It's her relative oppa.

205
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:20,330
Um, I'm sorry, but may I leave first?

206
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:22,380
It's time for Jin Hee to get out of her study academy.

207
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:24,340
Ah, go ahead and leave first.

208
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,180
Office Manager, please leave with her too. Your house is in the same direction, right?

209
00:15:27,180 --> 00:15:33,450
Then please have light and bubbly hearts tonight just like the foam on the beer we drank today.

210
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:34,920
We'll be heading on.

211
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,440
Yes, please head on.

212
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,450
Wait a second. Beer foam?

213
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:40,920
What is he talking about, CEO?

214
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,830
I'm not sure what he meant by beer foam.

215
00:15:42,830 --> 00:15:45,760
- Oh! Lawyer Kwon is here. 
- Oh, you're here?

216
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:48,960
Ah, Lawyer Kwon, why did you just get here? We waited so long for you.

217
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,310
Our discussion went on longer than planned.

218
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:54,590
Oh! It's Kwon Jeong Rok. Kwon Jeong Rok!

219
00:15:54,590 --> 00:15:58,550
Lawyer Kwon, why are you just getting here?

220
00:15:58,550 --> 00:16:03,970
I have  sooooooo  much to say to you!

221
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,100
Are you drunk?

222
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:11,370
Who said anything about being drunk? I'm not drunk, you know.

223
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:16,760
Lawyer Kwon. Jeong. Rok!

224
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:23,220
Let's have a serious discussion with clear minds.

225
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,930
Did you just push me?

226
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,440
Kwon Jeong Rok!

227
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,980
- What's up with you?
 - I start working tomorrow.

228
00:17:37,980 --> 00:17:42,050
- So?
 - I came here in a hurry, so I haven't found a house yet.

229
00:17:42,790 --> 00:17:45,640
- And so?
 - Let me use a favor.

230
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:48,270
Did you have a team dinner? It's late. Let's go inside.

231
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:49,420
Kim Se Won.

232
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,990
Huh?

233
00:17:50,990 --> 00:17:54,900
I'm saying this because it's cold. I've been waiting here for two hours.

234
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:56,890
Take me with you. Okay?

235
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,000
Let's go.

236
00:18:03,050 --> 00:18:05,850
Ah, it's so warm. How nice.

237
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,230
I heard you got a new secretary. Did you have a welcome party?

238
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:18,010
- How did you know? 
- Joon Gyoo told me.

239
00:18:18,010 --> 00:18:21,980
- He said that someone amazing came.
 - Did he say who it was, too?

240
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,650
No.

241
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,770
Why? Is she someone I know?

242
00:18:26,770 --> 00:18:28,610
You don't need to know.

243
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:31,470
Why? Who is it that you're acting like that?

244
00:18:31,470 --> 00:18:34,150
What about Yeo Reum? Did you meet with her?

245
00:18:36,610 --> 00:18:38,730
For a moment.

246
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,830
She wouldn't even let me really see her.

247
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:43,160
What were you expecting?

248
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:46,100
I know, right?

249
00:18:47,220 --> 00:18:48,970
She's gotten skinny.

250
00:18:48,970 --> 00:18:50,140
Is that so?

251
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:52,260
And she's still pretty.

252
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:59,390
I think this house is big enough for two residents. Shall we just live here together?

253
00:19:00,690 --> 00:19:04,310
If you're okay with sleeping on the sofa without a blanket, then go ahead.

254
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:06,560
I can't sleep beside you?

255
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:10,140
- Will you leave, even if it's just right now?
 - No, I'm going to stay.

256
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:14,160
You have beer in the fridge, don't you? Of course you do.

257
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,890
I'm so embarrassed. How embarrassing!

258
00:19:24,890 --> 00:19:28,160
- How embarrassing!
 - Yoon Seo. I understand, so calm down.

259
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,630
And what's with "embarrassing" ( slang )? An actress cannot use such a word!

260
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:35,410
Why? In a situation like this, that word fits perfectly!

261
00:19:35,410 --> 00:19:39,090
I almost died of embarrassment earlier, Oppa!

262
00:19:39,090 --> 00:19:40,210
That's right. You're right.

263
00:19:40,210 --> 00:19:42,760
Kwon Jeong Rok, that horrible jerk.

264
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,260
How can he push me like that?

265
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:49,200
From what I heard, he didn't push you.

266
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:55,260
Of course, if that jerk would have just caught you then,

267
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:57,870
- you wouldn't have fallen like that on the floor.
 - Right.

268
00:19:57,870 --> 00:20:02,600
That jerk. Does it cost a million one, or ten million won to catch you? This cheap lawyer jerk.

269
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:04,390
Exactly!

270
00:20:04,390 --> 00:20:08,410
I cannot let this go. I'm going to get revenge on that man.

271
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:11,230
What do you mean revenge?

272
00:20:13,010 --> 00:20:17,340
I will do the revenge! What do you want me to do? Should I break him into pieces?

273
00:20:17,340 --> 00:20:19,550
No! I will do it myself.

274
00:20:19,550 --> 00:20:21,150
You are going to break him into pieces yourself?

275
00:20:21,150 --> 00:20:22,960
No!

276
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:26,260
I'm going to become a perfect secretary.

277
00:20:26,260 --> 00:20:29,480
I will make him a man who cannot do anything without me.

278
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,060
When I suddenly quit in three months,

279
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:35,640
I will make him feel my absence and I will make him cry a river!

280
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:38,480
That sounds like revenge on your ex.

281
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,410
I will crush Kwon Jeong Rok.

282
00:20:41,410 --> 00:20:47,420
I will go to hell after getting back at Kwon Jeong Rok!

283
00:20:59,780 --> 00:21:01,460
There must be no one if I go now.

284
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:05,150
Of course. Work hour begins at 9. It's only 8 now.

285
00:21:05,150 --> 00:21:07,170
If you bump into your co-workers, it will be a bit embarrassing.

286
00:21:07,170 --> 00:21:09,030
So hurry up and go. Stay in your office.

287
00:21:09,030 --> 00:21:13,480
Right. I was going to go crazy over my work from today anyway.

288
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:16,830
I will stay in my office all day and totally focus on my work.

289
00:21:16,830 --> 00:21:20,270
Focus! That sounds good. Right!

290
00:21:20,270 --> 00:21:24,430
My Yoon Seo, let's go wild today!

291
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,180
Ready?

292
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:31,960
She shouldn't go too wild.

293
00:21:42,570 --> 00:21:44,530
Why are you...

294
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:46,940
This fell down.

295
00:21:47,510 --> 00:21:49,670
You're okay, right?

296
00:21:49,670 --> 00:21:51,910
Of course I am.,

297
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,180
Yoon Seo.

298
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:02,180
- Good morning.
 - Good morning.

299
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:09,860
Good morning, everyone.

300
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:12,060
Oh, right. Are you okay?

301
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,920
You should have gotten some bruises, right?

302
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:17,980
Oh, no. I'm fine.

303
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,930
What are you talking about?

304
00:22:19,930 --> 00:22:23,650
Yoon Seo fell really hard on the ground yesterday.

305
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:25,840
Fell hard?

306
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:29,220
Okay, listen. Lawyer Kwon came to the team dinner a bit late yesterday.

307
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:33,840
I guess Yoon Seo wanted to talk to him. She was dashing towards him and her heel slipped!

308
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:36,430
So, she lost her balance, but

309
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:39,710
Lawyer Kwon didn't catch her. He dodged her so she fell.

310
00:22:39,710 --> 00:22:40,880
Oh my goodness.

311
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:42,930
- Lawyer Kwon dodged it?
 - Yes.

312
00:22:42,930 --> 00:22:44,250
He was completely wrong, wasn't he?

313
00:22:44,250 --> 00:22:49,390
So Yoon Seo tried not to fall. She held onto a trash can and kept running to the end.

314
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:53,380
- In the end, she fell. 
- Wait, I'm a bit confused.

315
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,780
What do you mean she ran pushing a trash can?

316
00:22:55,780 --> 00:22:58,550
Well, that is...

317
00:23:01,000 --> 00:23:02,840
So, like this.

318
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,230
Stop.

319
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,950
Oh, I'm sorry.

320
00:23:17,950 --> 00:23:21,880
I just wanted to help her with understanding the situation.

321
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,280
Never mind.

322
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,140
I'm good.

323
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,770
Well, then.

324
00:23:35,890 --> 00:23:38,470
Oh, gosh. It's so embarrassing.

325
00:23:38,470 --> 00:23:41,860
I mean, why did everyone come so early today?

326
00:23:41,860 --> 00:23:45,510
Ah, sheesh.

327
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,930
Lawyer Kwon!

328
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,830
Hi.

329
00:23:49,830 --> 00:23:52,010
You were seriously too much.

330
00:23:52,660 --> 00:23:55,120
You were too wrong.

331
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:57,490
Why did you do that yesterday?

332
00:23:57,490 --> 00:24:00,400
- I did something? 
- You really don't know?

333
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:03,220
You should've caught Yoon Seo a bit.

334
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:05,190
How could you dodge it like this?

335
00:24:05,190 --> 00:24:08,850
I didn't move my leg that much. Just a little like this.

336
00:24:08,850 --> 00:24:10,470
I saw you moving your leg like this.

337
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:12,830
It's in human nature to catch when a person falls. Look.

338
00:24:12,830 --> 00:24:17,700
It should be your instinct to hold the bag.. when it falls. You should've caught it. Why don't you?

339
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,220
You are really something.

340
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:26,300
Anyway, I'm relieved that it was just us that witnessed it. What would've happened if there were others?

341
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:30,720
People could've uploaded pictures of her all over the internet saying "Oh Yoon Seo's Embarrassing Moments" and all.

342
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:35,350
Anyway, I wonder if she's doing okay, mentally.

343
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:39,780
She got seriously embarrassed and humiliated in front of all those people.

344
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:42,880
What if she says that she isn't going to work starting tomorrow?

345
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:44,980
Is that an option?

346
00:24:46,540 --> 00:24:49,490
What is that expression? Are you looking forward to it?

347
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:55,350
If Yoon Seo quits, don't ever come to work, Lawyer Kwon.

348
00:24:55,350 --> 00:24:57,880
- Are you serious? 
- Of course, I'm joking.

349
00:24:57,880 --> 00:24:59,950
Please treat her nicely.

350
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,010
Treat her nicely, nicely, nicely.

351
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:05,600
Treat her well, please. Okay?

352
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:11,140
Anyway, think of my cousin. Please treat her well.

353
00:25:11,140 --> 00:25:12,760
I've never seen what he looks like.

354
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:14,760
He's cute.

355
00:25:18,090 --> 00:25:20,190
- Good morning. 
 - Good morning.

356
00:25:20,190 --> 00:25:21,320
Hello.

357
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:26,400
I didn't know Lawyer was such a merciless person. I'm really disappointed.

358
00:25:30,470 --> 00:25:35,850
I heard it too. I think you went a little too far yesterday.

359
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:41,160
Not a little. It was much worse.

360
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:46,230
Yoon Seo seemed she wasn't in a good mood. What are you going to do?

361
00:25:46,230 --> 00:25:51,180
Right. She got a full load of embarrassment on her welcome party, not a welcoming bouquet. How could she be in a good mood?

362
00:25:51,180 --> 00:25:53,340
Why did you do that?

363
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,480
I'm sorry.

364
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:01,930
If I made you feel bad, I want to formally apologize.

365
00:26:12,910 --> 00:26:15,780
Good morning, Lawyer Kwon.

366
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:17,790
Well, good morning.

367
00:26:17,790 --> 00:26:21,120
Would you like a cup of morning coffee?

368
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:22,650
No, thanks.

369
00:26:22,650 --> 00:26:25,650
If you need anything, please tell me.

370
00:26:25,650 --> 00:26:28,910
I've made up my mind

371
00:26:28,910 --> 00:26:31,970
to be a perfect secretary from today.

372
00:26:33,780 --> 00:26:35,030
Rather than that, about yesterday...

373
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:39,080
 What is it? Is he going to apologize? I will gladly accept it then. 

374
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:41,260
You drank too much, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

375
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,990
It was hard to see.

376
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:47,870
- Excuse me? 
 - I think you should control how much you drink from now on.

377
00:26:47,870 --> 00:26:49,890
What was that—

378
00:26:53,300 --> 00:26:55,560
Instead of advice,

379
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:58,200
you should give me your apology.

380
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:01,120
My apology?

381
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,680
Yesterday... Because of you, Mr. Lawyer,

382
00:27:04,680 --> 00:27:07,460
I fell, you know.

383
00:27:07,460 --> 00:27:11,270
Frankly speaking, you fell yourself. Not because of me.

384
00:27:11,270 --> 00:27:15,620
So... Are you saying you are not responsible?

385
00:27:15,620 --> 00:27:18,140
I feel morally responsible.

386
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:20,030
Morally?

387
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,700
Involuntary criminal battery!

388
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,870
You stepped aside knowing that

389
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:30,590
I might get hurt if you didn't catch me.

390
00:27:30,590 --> 00:27:35,660
You neglected a drunk person who couldn't even stand still.

391
00:27:35,660 --> 00:27:37,150
You know some law, I see.

392
00:27:37,150 --> 00:27:40,140
As you know, I went to law school.

393
00:27:40,140 --> 00:27:41,950
That's not what's important here.

394
00:27:41,950 --> 00:27:45,320
If you want to rebut, give it your best shot, Mr. Lawyer.

395
00:27:45,320 --> 00:27:48,900
What do you think about your act of overdrinking to the point that you couldn't control your own body?

396
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:53,580
- Excuse me? 
- You must be aware of your alcohol tolerance. You must have known that you drank too much.

397
00:27:53,580 --> 00:27:56,310
Isn't this also willful negligence?

398
00:27:56,310 --> 00:27:57,790
Well, then.

399
00:27:59,060 --> 00:28:03,400
Well, then? Well, then, then? Then?

400
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:05,370
Gosh, so annoying!

401
00:28:08,290 --> 00:28:11,240
How does it feel like to be back after such a long time?

402
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:17,060
Well, I'm just thankful to you for having me. This is why people say having good personal connections is important.

403
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:22,010
You must have gone through the documents, right? I'm sorry for bombarding you with so much work already.

404
00:28:22,010 --> 00:28:24,990
That's what you brought me here for, no?

405
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:30,140
CEO Jeong Ji Won ... He's the one who was recently accused of gambling abroad, right?

406
00:28:30,140 --> 00:28:35,040
Right. Prosecutor Park is in charge of that one. You dig into embezzlement.

407
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,220
You have evidence?

408
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,500
There was an informant. We had some suspicions for a while but couldn't accuse him.

409
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:42,880
- How come? 
- What do you think?

410
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,400
Are you saying I solely take responsibility for this case?

411
00:28:45,400 --> 00:28:51,020
No, I needed someone reckless like you to investigate this case.

412
00:28:51,020 --> 00:28:55,130
Oh, goodness. Since you're speaking so highly of my capabilities,

413
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:57,250
I will do my best.

414
00:28:57,250 --> 00:29:01,420
It won't be easy doing it alone. I will send someone. Good luck.

415
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:03,220
Thank you.

416
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:24,030
Wait. Well, are you Prosecutor Kim Se Won?

417
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,330
Yes, I am Kim Se Won.

418
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,950
Oh, yes. Hello.

419
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,600
I'm the Investigative Director, Kim Hyeong Sik.

420
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:32,070
I'm Yoo Hyeon Ji. I'm looking forward to working with you.

421
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:35,300
- I'm looking forward to working with you too.
- I'm Prosecutor Lee Joo Yeong.

422
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:41,390
I've been working on the case of gambling abroad with Prosecutor Park. I know about Jeong Ji Won well.

423
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:46,170
Then, we will be rolling quickly. Finish up organizing your stuff first and let's start with a briefing of the case.

424
00:29:46,170 --> 00:29:48,420
Let's meet in three minutes.

425
00:29:50,090 --> 00:29:52,360
In three minutes? We are not instant noodles or something.

426
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,930
I've heard of him through rumors, but still.

427
00:29:53,930 --> 00:29:55,020
Is a meeting an instant curry?

428
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,800
Exactly.

429
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,680
Yes? This is Always Law Firm, the office of Mr. Kwon Jeong Rok.

430
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:07,050
Why bother picking up?

431
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:10,570
Yes, please wait a moment.

432
00:30:14,790 --> 00:30:19,070
What are you doing? I transferred the call to your extension.

433
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:22,890
It's a client named Kim Myeong Hwan.

434
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:25,240
Alright.

435
00:30:31,740 --> 00:30:33,990
Yes, this is Kwon Jeong Rok speaking.

436
00:30:33,990 --> 00:30:36,890
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

437
00:30:36,890 --> 00:30:39,180
Let's meet in an hour then.

438
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,620
Okay.

439
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:03,130
I'm going to meet my client.

440
00:31:03,130 --> 00:31:05,320
Yes, I understand.

441
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,160
Right. I don't think I can have lunch with you today.

442
00:31:08,160 --> 00:31:11,700
Alright, don't worry. About my lunch,

443
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:14,050
I will take care of it myself.

444
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:16,590
Okay, then. Sounds good.

445
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:21,900
Ah, what should I do about lunch?

446
00:31:21,900 --> 00:31:22,940
Pho?

447
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:25,810
Okay, I will bring it to you.

448
00:31:25,810 --> 00:31:27,150
Why pho?

449
00:31:27,150 --> 00:31:29,640
Yoon Seo says she doesn't have anyone to have lunch with. She wants me to deliver it for her.

450
00:31:29,640 --> 00:31:33,360
Is that right? Go ahead. It's not like she's asking you to buy a pho restaurant.

451
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,000
Go ahead.

452
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,750
Hey, by the way. Doesn't Yoon Seo look so pretty when she eats?

453
00:31:38,750 --> 00:31:40,820
Of course, she eats well.

454
00:31:40,820 --> 00:31:45,160
Right, right. She looks so pretty, right? I fell for that. I cast her from off the street, right there, right then.

455
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:47,260
Is that so?

456
00:31:47,970 --> 00:31:51,130
She was  really  pretty.

457
00:31:51,130 --> 00:31:55,200
 14 years ago
 I don't think I'm suited for this managing job. 

458
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,830
 Should I just get a loan and open a bar or something? 

459
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:00,200
 Four boongeobbang, please.   ( Fish shaped bread )

460
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:03,050
 - Okay.
 - Alright, I know. 

461
00:32:04,070 --> 00:32:09,030
 Let's grab soju someday. It's on you. 

462
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,120
 Okay. 

463
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:16,300
 Oh, hey, hey! You are hiding boongeobbang, aren't you? 

464
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:19,280
 - No, I'm not.
 - What do you mean you're not? Let's share! 

465
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,920
 Let me see! 

466
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:25,770
 Here they are! Four of them! 

467
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:02,130
♬ Ghada ♬

468
00:33:02,130 --> 00:33:05,550
-  Here they are!  
- Here they are.

469
00:33:06,650 --> 00:33:10,110
That one commercial gave her a big name.

470
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:15,060
Thanks to her, I have come to this. Time flies, you know.

471
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:24,790
I... I will see my Yoon Seo rising again.

472
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,170
- I suddenly got teary-eyed for no reason. 
- Could it be male menopause?

473
00:33:32,170 --> 00:33:36,700
- I heard that controlling your emotions becomes difficult with male menopause.
 - Oh, really? Shut up.

474
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:44,910
Oh, Manager Yoo. What's up?

475
00:33:44,910 --> 00:33:48,540
Is that so? Got it, don't worry.

476
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:50,460
Alright.

477
00:33:50,460 --> 00:33:54,720
Min Ji is going on a business trip out of town. You should go with her. Manager Yoo is sick.

478
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,140
- Mr. CEO, what about our Yoon Seo's transportation?
 - Tell her to take a taxi.

479
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:03,300
We are buying her pho. That's good, right? Min Ji is on the rise. We need to support her.

480
00:34:03,300 --> 00:34:06,620
You are a manager, so how could you not know that?

481
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:09,630
What? Are you irritated?

482
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:23,030
It's still hot, isn't it? The noodles are not soggy, right?

483
00:34:23,030 --> 00:34:27,610
This Oppa did everything to make sure I deliver the most delicious noodles in a perfect state.

484
00:34:27,610 --> 00:34:31,860
You are everything to me, Oppa. Now, I can breathe a bit.

485
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:34,610
My hard work pays off. It was worth it.

486
00:34:34,610 --> 00:34:37,900
By the way, why don't you eat with your co-workers?

487
00:34:37,900 --> 00:34:41,090
After what happened last night, how could I eat with them? I'm too embarrassed.

488
00:34:41,090 --> 00:34:45,740
Right. Did that rude lawyer apologize?

489
00:34:46,590 --> 00:34:49,800
Apologize, my butt. He said he did nothing wrong worth apologizing for.

490
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:55,260
Wow, unbelievable, that rude jerk. I won't let this go.

491
00:34:55,260 --> 00:34:58,410
That car! That's him, that's him.

492
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:01,840
- What? What do you mean? 
 - That rude lawyer.

493
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,180
What? That jerk—

494
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,470
Hold on.

495
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:10,490
He's really good-looking.

496
00:35:11,630 --> 00:35:16,070
What do you mean he's good-looking? Take a good look!

497
00:35:16,070 --> 00:35:19,790
I'm taking a good look, but he's still handsome.

498
00:35:20,630 --> 00:35:25,580
Oh, now I'm looking at him carefully. He kind of looks mean.

499
00:35:25,580 --> 00:35:28,760
Why did you hide by the way?

500
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:32,730
Why do you think? I've set the concept of being a law firm employee so I can work hard.

501
00:35:32,730 --> 00:35:35,570
What am I supposed to do if I get caught being with my manager?

502
00:35:35,570 --> 00:35:40,600
It's not so elegant to eat pho in a car after all.

503
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:48,460
I should hurry and get back. A perfect secretary never leaves her place.

504
00:35:58,320 --> 00:36:01,520
That guy. He was really good-looking though.

505
00:36:02,120 --> 00:36:05,330
This lunch box is good. We should get deliveries from here often.

506
00:36:05,330 --> 00:36:07,530
It's good.

507
00:36:08,990 --> 00:36:12,430
Right, why isn't Yoon Seo having lunch with us?

508
00:36:12,430 --> 00:36:16,190
It's not that she's not having lunch with us, but it seems like she's not eating at all.

509
00:36:16,190 --> 00:36:19,920
I think she feels too embarrassed to have fallen in front of all of us.

510
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:24,600
I mean she was drunk but I think she said she can't eat by herself or something.

511
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:28,360
- Who would she be eating with today? 
 - Would she have Job's tears tea again?

512
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:33,260
I saw her drinking Job's tears tea by herself whenever Lawyer Kwon was not present.

513
00:36:49,090 --> 00:36:51,300
You are back.

514
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,270
Yes.

515
00:36:53,270 --> 00:36:55,810
Then, why are you standing here?

516
00:36:55,810 --> 00:36:58,830
Do you need anything?

517
00:36:58,830 --> 00:37:01,130
- Let's go have lunch.
 - Pardon?

518
00:37:01,130 --> 00:37:04,960
Since you drank a lot yesterday, how about pho?

519
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:07,970
Pho?

520
00:37:09,330 --> 00:37:12,360
I think I'm good.

521
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:14,770
Sorry? How come?

522
00:37:14,770 --> 00:37:16,320
Well.

523
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,720
- I... I'm on a diet.
 - Diet?

524
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:23,760
Yes, well. I thought I should go on a diet.

525
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,990
Okay. Well, then.

526
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,180
What lunch, out of nowhere? He should've told me earlier.

527
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:52,210
♬ I've chosen to be faithful. I've chosen to obey you. ♬

528
00:38:03,260 --> 00:38:06,680
What was that? Why did she do that?

529
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:15,080
Hi, you are here again.

530
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,800
Hello.

531
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:24,230
You want your sandwich on a honey oat roll with honey mustard, right?

532
00:38:24,230 --> 00:38:26,690
- Yes, Honey. 
 - Sorry?

533
00:38:27,210 --> 00:38:30,350
Yes, yes. You're right.

534
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:32,830
How do you remember that?

535
00:38:32,830 --> 00:38:36,800
How do I not? You are a special customer.

536
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:39,430
A special... customer.

537
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,160
Excuse me, Ma'am.

538
00:38:42,130 --> 00:38:44,570
You look like my maternal grandmother.

539
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,420
Your grandmother?

540
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:52,400
I'm asking this because you feel like family. Can I call you "auntie" from now on?

541
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,280
Yes.

542
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:19,890
Lawyer Dan. You saw me but why didn't you say hi?

543
00:39:19,890 --> 00:39:22,640
Why are you just leaving?

544
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,390
Please pretend  that you didn't see what happened back there.

545
00:39:26,390 --> 00:39:31,950
Saw what? I was too busy eating. I didn't see anything.

546
00:39:31,950 --> 00:39:34,950
- Really? 
 - No, not at all.

547
00:39:34,950 --> 00:39:39,720
It was just that part-timer that you liked said you resemble his maternal grandmother.

548
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:42,590
He asked to call you "auntie." That's all I saw.

549
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:46,360
You must be happy to have a nephew now.

550
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:49,330
You should stop there.

551
00:39:50,290 --> 00:39:53,530
Don't get too hurt. You will be able to

552
00:39:53,530 --> 00:39:57,190
fall for someone else soon, anyway.

553
00:39:57,190 --> 00:40:00,200
You are a hopeless romantic, Lawyer Dan.

554
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:16,890
Mr. Lawyer. How about a cup of coffee?

555
00:40:16,890 --> 00:40:19,510
No, thanks.

556
00:40:19,510 --> 00:40:23,110
It's 3 pm. People feel most tired at this hour.

557
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:27,740
I will bring you a cup quickly so you can focus on your work even better.

558
00:40:30,070 --> 00:40:32,810
There's no need...

559
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:44,990
Ah, it's so embarrassing. Out of all people, why Lawyer Choi?

560
00:40:44,990 --> 00:40:48,160
Why feel bothered? It's not something new anyway.

561
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:49,860
What did you say?

562
00:40:50,490 --> 00:40:56,830
If I were a bit prettier... If I were skinny, pure, and beautiful like Ms. Oh Yoon Seo, I wouldn't have experienced this.

563
00:40:56,830 --> 00:41:00,390
I guess she's never had such humiliating moments, right?

564
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:03,500
Of course not. Our lawyers said the same.

565
00:41:03,500 --> 00:41:09,400
There are many male celebrities that said Oh Yoon Seo is their ideal type of woman. She was really popular, you know.

566
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:13,230
That's why she had that scandal with that large conglomerate's grandson, right?

567
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:16,170
- What do you think really happened? 
 - That drug scandal?

568
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:19,270
- There were negative results and she was acquitted.
 - No, not that.

569
00:41:19,270 --> 00:41:22,140
I'm curious what kind of relationship she had with that third generation chaebol.   (Chaebol - family thatowns a conglomerate.) 

570
00:41:22,140 --> 00:41:25,570
It must be a fact that she was there.

571
00:41:25,570 --> 00:41:30,540
- Right. If she had nothing to do with him, she wouldn't have been there in the first place. 
 - I read some gossip—

572
00:41:30,540 --> 00:41:33,980
Oh, you were all here.

573
00:41:33,980 --> 00:41:36,540
You were having a tea time.

574
00:41:36,540 --> 00:41:41,010
I'm going to bring Lawyer Kwon a cup of coffee.

575
00:41:41,010 --> 00:41:43,220
- Sure. 
 - Oh!

576
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:46,420
- You are wearing makeup today, right?
 - I always do.

577
00:41:47,060 --> 00:41:48,870
Really?

578
00:41:49,940 --> 00:41:52,430
It's extra nice today.

579
00:42:01,600 --> 00:42:03,130
Yes.

580
00:42:09,170 --> 00:42:10,770
Here.

581
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:13,990
Please have some. It smells nice.

582
00:42:14,850 --> 00:42:16,810
Thank you.

583
00:42:43,220 --> 00:42:46,200
What's wrong? Did something happen?

584
00:42:48,660 --> 00:42:50,600
Nothing happened.

585
00:42:52,010 --> 00:42:56,290
Why? Did the lawyer bully you again?

586
00:42:56,290 --> 00:42:59,480
I'll tell the president to change lawyers.

587
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:03,780
Forget it. I told you I'm going to become a perfect secretary

588
00:43:03,780 --> 00:43:06,520
to take my revenge on that person.

589
00:43:06,520 --> 00:43:10,810
I had a lot of revenge today. I did extension connections, made copies,

590
00:43:10,810 --> 00:43:13,760
and even gave him his coffee perfectly.

591
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:16,180
I'm proud of you, Yoon Seo.

592
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:21,970
Yoon Seo, you are going to need to go to and leave work tomorrow by yourself.

593
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:23,780
I can't pick you up.

594
00:43:23,780 --> 00:43:25,570
Why?

595
00:43:25,570 --> 00:43:28,020
I have military reserves training.

596
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:32,990
Then, what should I do?

597
00:43:32,990 --> 00:43:35,760
Take the taxi, just for tomorrow.

598
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:39,360
I don't like taxis. It's also bothersome to find them.

599
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,590
I was going to stick a road manager with you,

600
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:47,710
but of all times, there's no one with an empty schedule tomorrow.

601
00:43:47,710 --> 00:43:51,440
I get it. I'll figure it out tomorrow, so Oppa,

602
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:53,450
you do well on your training.

603
00:43:53,450 --> 00:43:55,080
Yes.

604
00:43:56,620 --> 00:43:58,370
- But, Oppa.
 - Hm?

605
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:01,900
- Did you serve in the military?
 - Of course, I did.

606
00:44:04,650 --> 00:44:08,320
What do you take me for?

607
00:44:08,320 --> 00:44:13,020
I went to a really tough place!

608
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:16,060
I've been too gentle on you, haven't I?

609
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,490
I'll speed up a little now.

610
00:44:26,170 --> 00:44:29,460
- You came earlier than I thought. Did you eat dinner? 
 - Not yet.

611
00:44:29,460 --> 00:44:31,910
I thought so. That's why I prepared these.

612
00:44:33,250 --> 00:44:37,720
I'm a perfect roommate, aren't I? Doesn't it make you want to keep living with me?

613
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,320
If possible, find a house quickly.

614
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,070
You're so inflexible, you rascal.

615
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:46,800
Yeo Reum might call soon since she drank alcohol.

616
00:44:48,230 --> 00:44:50,460
She received some stress because of me.

617
00:44:50,460 --> 00:44:52,870
- So, can you— 
 - It's a problem between you two, so you two figure it out.

618
00:44:52,870 --> 00:44:55,220
Why? Yeo Reum likes you.

619
00:44:55,220 --> 00:44:57,910
She really trusts you and depends on you.

620
00:44:57,910 --> 00:45:01,160
Then, she would've chosen me from the beginning.

621
00:45:02,510 --> 00:45:05,100
- She would have, right? 
 - Don't show off, I don't want to see it.

622
00:45:05,100 --> 00:45:09,160
You're so inflexible. Change your personality.

623
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:13,960
I can live with you because I am me. But, others won't be able to handle you.

624
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:18,380
That new secretary might also have a really hard time adjusting to you.

625
00:45:18,380 --> 00:45:20,650
Forget it.

626
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:22,440
Forget it.

627
00:45:39,800 --> 00:45:41,830
 Application for Temporary Injunction to Prohibit Transfer of Real Property 

628
00:45:43,720 --> 00:45:46,320
 I don't see the important documents that I need to review right now. 

629
00:45:46,320 --> 00:45:49,320
 I told you to just sit around if you have nothing else to do. Don't you remember? 

630
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,930
 I am also trying to work hard in my own way. Do you have to get so angry? 

631
00:45:52,930 --> 00:45:55,290
 I don't know how to do much. 

632
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:58,170
 However, if you teach me, I'll work hard to do well. 

633
00:45:58,170 --> 00:46:01,260
 - I've read some gossip.
 - Gossip? 

634
00:46:02,210 --> 00:46:04,470
 Were you all here? 

635
00:46:04,470 --> 00:46:06,940
 Drink it. The scent is nice. 

636
00:46:06,940 --> 00:46:08,920
 Thank you. 

637
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,510
Well.

638
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,370
This kind of feel should be okay.

639
00:46:48,780 --> 00:46:51,750
If I don't get nervous,

640
00:46:51,750 --> 00:46:55,780
I can arrive safely. Ready...

641
00:46:57,740 --> 00:46:59,830
Action!

642
00:47:11,530 --> 00:47:16,710
Ah, I get it.

643
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:18,750
Will you not drive properly!

644
00:47:18,750 --> 00:47:21,210
I also want to do it properly.

645
00:47:21,210 --> 00:47:23,600
Lower your window. Lower your window!

646
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:27,190
The law firm is right in front of me, why can't I go?

647
00:47:27,190 --> 00:47:30,940
Will you not lower it? You won't lower it? Alright, you're dead!

648
00:47:30,940 --> 00:47:32,860
Whoa, oh my gosh!

649
00:47:34,460 --> 00:47:37,690
What the heck? Why doesn't he move?

650
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:43,150
Let's go, let's go.

651
00:47:50,250 --> 00:47:54,090
What should I do? Did I cause an accident?

652
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:58,280
 Actress Oh Yoon Seo got into trouble again. 

653
00:47:58,280 --> 00:48:03,050
 Two years ago, due to her drugs scandal, actress Oh Yoon Seo who announced a temporary retirement, 

654
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:06,160
 this time, she is put under the spotlight again for her reckless driving. 

655
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,040
 Under the spotlight. 

656
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:09,840
What should I do?

657
00:48:11,020 --> 00:48:13,760
Get out. Hey, get out.

658
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,510
Get out, Ahjumma! First thing in the morning, this is so annoying.

659
00:48:18,510 --> 00:48:23,410
She ran into it. If you ran into someone else's car, you should get out!

660
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,780
Madam Kim! Let me see your face!

661
00:48:25,780 --> 00:48:29,050
Take off your sunglasses! Lower your window and get out! Come out here!

662
00:48:29,050 --> 00:48:31,980
Why isn't he picking up?

663
00:48:31,980 --> 00:48:35,560
If you ran into my car, you should get out and check. Should I break your car?

664
00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:39,990
Look! Look at here! Here! Here! I'm breaking it!

665
00:48:42,730 --> 00:48:44,710
Please stop it.

666
00:48:45,700 --> 00:48:48,630
- Who are you? 
 - You can talk with me from now on.

667
00:48:48,630 --> 00:48:51,140
I'm her lawyer.

668
00:48:51,140 --> 00:48:53,080
Law-Lawyer?

669
00:48:53,080 --> 00:48:57,370
If you are a lawyer, can you  run into someone's car like that?

670
00:48:57,370 --> 00:48:59,260
We can't pretend nothing happened.

671
00:48:59,260 --> 00:49:03,090
However, we can't pretend that the thing you did also never happened.

672
00:49:03,090 --> 00:49:07,150
- What did I do? 
- What you did can be considered as reckless driving and  road rage.

673
00:49:07,150 --> 00:49:10,650
According to  Article 151 Clause 2 of the Road Traffic Act, you could end up with

674
00:49:10,650 --> 00:49:12,960
up to  a year imprisonment or receive up to a 5 million won fine.

675
00:49:12,960 --> 00:49:15,370
No, but right now, this woman,

676
00:49:15,370 --> 00:49:19,660
she ran into the back of my car!

677
00:49:20,210 --> 00:49:21,710
Yes.

678
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:25,410
For further confirmation, we can check the black box.

679
00:49:25,410 --> 00:49:28,880
The fact that you changed the lane without signaling

680
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:31,010
has also been recorded.

681
00:49:35,610 --> 00:49:37,800
Now that I look at it, it didn't leave a scratch.

682
00:49:37,800 --> 00:49:41,420
Well, while you are driving, these things and those things happen.

683
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:46,260
We shouldn't raise our voices and go overboard with something like this.

684
00:49:46,260 --> 00:49:49,930
I will let it go for a settlement. Let's do a settlement.

685
00:49:49,930 --> 00:49:53,220
No, let's do it by the law.

686
00:49:53,220 --> 00:49:55,580
Because I like the law.

687
00:49:59,460 --> 00:50:01,810
Why are you looking at me like that?

688
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,900
When was I looking at you?

689
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:11,820
Then, why are you looking at me like that?

690
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,780
Because I'm wondering if you really don't need to go to the hospital.

691
00:50:14,780 --> 00:50:17,330
I don't need to go.

692
00:50:17,330 --> 00:50:19,560
I'm all right.

693
00:50:22,100 --> 00:50:25,120
By the way, how did you know it was me?

694
00:50:25,670 --> 00:50:27,900
I saw you.

695
00:50:34,890 --> 00:50:37,620
 Get out. Hey! Get out. 

696
00:50:37,620 --> 00:50:41,310
 Get out, Ahjumma! First thing in the morning, this is so annoying. 

697
00:50:41,310 --> 00:50:45,210
 If you ran into someone else's car, you should get out. 

698
00:50:46,260 --> 00:50:50,600
Anyway, for coming out and defending me earlier,

699
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:52,270
I'm really thankful.

700
00:50:52,270 --> 00:50:56,860
To pay you back, I will work really hard today as well!

701
00:50:57,390 --> 00:51:00,270
Yes. Well, do as you like.

702
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:07,720
- Good morning, Ms. Oh Yoon Seo. 
 - Yes. Hello.

703
00:51:07,720 --> 00:51:10,360
Well.

704
00:51:16,310 --> 00:51:20,760
Lawyer Kwon's expression is always so stern.

705
00:51:20,760 --> 00:51:23,420
You are definitely inflexible.

706
00:51:23,420 --> 00:51:27,390
When you see Ms. Yoon Seo in the morning, you should be smiling ear to ear.

707
00:51:27,390 --> 00:51:31,860
You are working so close to her after all. How can he be so cold-hearted?

708
00:51:31,860 --> 00:51:35,640
You would be strangers outside of here, aren't I right?

709
00:51:35,640 --> 00:51:37,720
Yes. Well.

710
00:51:38,570 --> 00:51:40,340
Smile.

711
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:42,270
A big smile.

712
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,320
It might feel like you are in the middle of Siberia when you work with Lawyer Kwon,

713
00:51:53,320 --> 00:51:56,340
but I will help you a lot, so cheer up, Yoon Seo.

714
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:57,800
Yes. Well.

715
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:02,560
And Lawyer Kwon listens to my words well, so

716
00:52:02,560 --> 00:52:06,310
If Lawyer makes it hard for you or bullies you, you can tell me any time.

717
00:52:06,310 --> 00:52:09,650
Do not ever think of quitting.

718
00:52:10,550 --> 00:52:14,230
I don't know. He may be a better person than I thought.

719
00:52:14,230 --> 00:52:16,000
What did you say?

720
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,650
What? It's nothing.

721
00:52:21,210 --> 00:52:23,670
Did I hear her wrong?

722
00:52:46,370 --> 00:52:49,050
- Ms. Oh Jin Sim. 
 - Yes.

723
00:52:49,050 --> 00:52:50,560
You went to law school, right?

724
00:52:50,560 --> 00:52:53,100
Yes. Only for one semester. I wasn't kicked out.

725
00:52:53,100 --> 00:52:56,170
I left on my own because I had too much on my schedule.

726
00:52:56,170 --> 00:52:58,840
Have you ever looked up judicial precedents?

727
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:00,160
No.

728
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,580
If you search on the Supreme Court website,

729
00:53:03,580 --> 00:53:05,790
you will be able to find some relevant Supreme Court precedent cases.

730
00:53:05,790 --> 00:53:08,610
You just need to find anything relevant.

731
00:53:08,610 --> 00:53:10,430
What should I look for?

732
00:53:10,430 --> 00:53:13,730
Precedents related to pet dog noises.

733
00:53:16,100 --> 00:53:18,600
Even if it's not about noisy dogs, anything between neighbors.

734
00:53:18,600 --> 00:53:21,600
It could be cases about floor noises. It doesn't matter.

735
00:53:21,600 --> 00:53:25,900
Yes. Since it's my first task, I will do my best.

736
00:53:27,350 --> 00:53:29,900
Okay. Well, then.

737
00:53:38,680 --> 00:53:42,220
There aren't as many judicial precedents as I thought there might be.

738
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:46,260
Especially, there were even fewer precedents of lawsuits over pet dog noise.

739
00:53:47,100 --> 00:53:51,270
But, I did some research because I remembered hearing something before.

740
00:53:51,270 --> 00:53:53,890
Not in our country, but in the U.S.,

741
00:53:53,890 --> 00:53:59,540
there was an article about a man winning a lawsuit he filed over a noisy puppy next door.

742
00:53:59,540 --> 00:54:02,860
But, do you know the damage award was?

743
00:54:03,310 --> 00:54:06,810
It was five hundred million won.  Amazing, right?

744
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:09,870
When did you hear about such a case?

745
00:54:09,870 --> 00:54:14,120
We did a mock trial in our first semester in law school.

746
00:54:14,120 --> 00:54:18,120
I remembered some group did a presentation about the case.

747
00:54:18,120 --> 00:54:22,690
It must have been long ago. You still remember that?

748
00:54:22,690 --> 00:54:25,020
I have a good memory.

749
00:54:25,020 --> 00:54:28,300
So, I didn't get compliments on my acting from my directors, but

750
00:54:28,300 --> 00:54:32,420
I got a lot of compliments for memorizing my lines perfectly.

751
00:54:32,420 --> 00:54:35,520
Oh, well. It's nothing to brag about though.

752
00:54:35,520 --> 00:54:37,970
It is.

753
00:54:37,970 --> 00:54:39,440
Excuse me?

754
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:42,860
Anyway, it was helpful. You can leave now.

755
00:54:49,800 --> 00:54:54,200
Well, then.

756
00:54:54,300 --> 00:54:58,700
♬  One day, that warm smile.  ♬

757
00:54:58,700 --> 00:55:03,200
♬  I think I've changed. I've gotten curious about you.  ♬

758
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:06,260
♬  I'm so confused.  ♬

759
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:11,600
Is it because he's an ace in this law firm? He has so  much work.

760
00:55:11,700 --> 00:55:15,000
♬  It feels like a whole new memory now.  ♬

761
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:17,700
He said he detests people who don't get off work on time.

762
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:20,000
Should I really go home?

763
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:23,800
♬  I thought of you.  ♬

764
00:55:23,860 --> 00:55:28,020
♬  I just wanna be a star for you.  ♬

765
00:55:28,020 --> 00:55:32,760
♬  With my heart that I've been hiding  ♬

766
00:55:32,760 --> 00:55:37,980
♬  I will shine on you. I will hold your day  ♬

767
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,660
♬  That's sometimes dark and tiring  ♬

768
00:55:41,660 --> 00:55:45,870
Didn't realize it's this late. 
♬  I just wanna be your star with my heart  ♬

769
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:50,550
♬  With twinkling star light ♬

770
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:55,830
♬  I will lighten it up for you  ♬

771
00:55:55,830 --> 00:56:02,710
♬  I will fill your dark nights that you thought you were alone  ♬

772
00:56:14,080 --> 00:56:16,050
I didn't fall asleep.

773
00:56:16,050 --> 00:56:20,370
I just went over your schedule for tomorrow in my head.

774
00:56:20,370 --> 00:56:23,580
Why didn't you get off work?

775
00:56:23,580 --> 00:56:28,980
Just in case there was anything else you needed me to do.

776
00:56:28,980 --> 00:56:32,110
- Let's go eat.
 - What?

777
00:56:32,110 --> 00:56:34,090
I said, let's go eat.

778
00:56:34,950 --> 00:56:38,130
Why are you like this today?

779
00:56:38,640 --> 00:56:41,110
Why are you treating me so nicely?

780
00:56:41,110 --> 00:56:43,940
When I got in an accident, you readily helped me.

781
00:56:43,940 --> 00:56:48,420
You gave me a hard time, saying that doing nothing is helpful, but you gave me tasks today.

782
00:56:48,420 --> 00:56:51,590
You even gave me compliments. And now, you are asking me to eat together.

783
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:54,290
You are acting so strange, don't you think?

784
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:00,520
No way! I'm getting fired, aren't I?

785
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:03,780
You are nice to me because it's my last day. It's a goodbye meal, isn't it?

786
00:57:03,780 --> 00:57:07,850
It's nothing like that. I'm really asking you to have a meal with me, that's all.

787
00:57:10,540 --> 00:57:12,360
Let's go.

788
00:57:33,230 --> 00:57:36,310
Are you a regular here?

789
00:57:36,310 --> 00:57:39,930
There are no people here. Is it a secret hole-in-the-wall place?

790
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:44,690
No. Its food isn't that great. It's a bit too chewy.

791
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:46,010
Then why did we come here?

792
00:57:46,010 --> 00:57:49,580
Didn't you say you are not comfortable going to a busy restaurant?

793
00:57:49,580 --> 00:57:52,070
Then, it's for my sake.

794
00:57:52,070 --> 00:57:56,090
By the way, when are you going to take off those sunglasses?

795
00:57:56,090 --> 00:58:02,670
Right. It's not just that there are no people who would recognize me. There is no one here at all, so I can take them off.

796
00:58:05,740 --> 00:58:11,040
Oh! I did that soju commercial, do you remember?

797
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:14,450
I'm always the same?

798
00:58:14,450 --> 00:58:16,860
It's because I always keep my original intentions.

799
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:20,620
So, I like drinks like me.

800
00:58:20,620 --> 00:58:24,090
The same taste, from the beginning to the end.

801
00:58:24,090 --> 00:58:27,260
Like the First Intention!

802
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:34,620
What the heck? I feel so awkward.

803
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:38,690
I can drink a lot today, right?

804
00:58:38,690 --> 00:58:40,080
You drink a lot, often.

805
00:58:40,080 --> 00:58:43,380
I drank a lot at my welcome party because I wasn't in a good mood.

806
00:58:43,380 --> 00:58:49,150
Today, I'm going to drink a lot because I'm not in a bad mood.

807
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:00,890
Hi. It's freezing.

808
00:59:00,890 --> 00:59:03,710
You should replace these posters.

809
00:59:03,710 --> 00:59:05,570
Our company got a new model a while ago.

810
00:59:05,570 --> 00:59:08,280
We don't get many people anyway. Who's going to see them?

811
00:59:08,280 --> 00:59:10,850
That's why I brought new ones. I will put them up for you.

812
00:59:10,850 --> 00:59:12,940
Okay.

813
00:59:24,520 --> 00:59:30,150
I think we took the right seats, right? It would have been awkward if he recognized me.

814
00:59:38,270 --> 00:59:40,280
Good bye!

815
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:49,530
I think you are much tougher person than I thought, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

816
00:59:50,630 --> 00:59:54,830
Well, I got stronger while working in this industry.

817
00:59:54,830 --> 00:59:58,510
People always talk about me. They write hateful comments.

818
00:59:58,510 --> 01:00:00,990
There is gossip about things that I didn't do.

819
01:00:00,990 --> 01:00:04,940
I've experienced things like that for over ten years, so I'm used to it now.

820
01:00:06,250 --> 01:00:09,560
It would be a lie if I say I'm totally okay with it, though.

821
01:00:12,430 --> 01:00:15,300
How do you like working at the law firm?

822
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:22,190
It's been tough but it was okay today.

823
01:00:22,190 --> 01:00:24,330
I had some work to do today.

824
01:00:24,330 --> 01:00:29,050
I got compliments. I got this gobchang ( intenstine ) as a bonus!

825
01:00:41,360 --> 01:00:44,540
Mr. Lawyer. I will see you tomorrow.

826
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:47,100
Please take care.

827
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:55,290
Ms. Oh Jin Sim!

828
01:00:56,270 --> 01:00:59,590
I'm Oh Yoon Seo.

829
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,410
Yes?

830
01:01:03,100 --> 01:01:08,500
I have never thought of you as my secretary up to now.

831
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:16,200
It is true that I considered you an annoying presence since you were leaving soon.

832
01:01:17,510 --> 01:01:21,230
But I've decided to change that thinking from now on.

833
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:23,370
Pardon?

834
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:27,690
I want to give you a proper chance to work as my secretary.

835
01:01:28,330 --> 01:01:31,730
Let's start again from the beginning.

836
01:01:32,330 --> 01:01:34,330
For real?

837
01:01:44,380 --> 01:01:46,090
Thank you, Mr. Lawyer!

838
01:01:46,090 --> 01:01:50,410
I will seriously do my best!

839
01:02:05,050 --> 01:02:12,060


840
01:02:20,430 --> 01:02:21,980
I ...

841
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:26,320
I didn't dodge you this time.

842
01:02:27,870 --> 01:02:33,580
♬   Here. You and me. Right this moment.  ♬

843
01:02:33,580 --> 01:02:38,700
♬  I'm going to keep this somewhere deep in my heart.   ♬

844
01:02:38,700 --> 01:02:41,400
♬  The touch of one hand comfortably over another  ♬

845
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:44,930
♬  Even today's air. Everything.  ♬

846
01:02:44,930 --> 01:02:49,610
♬  Remember everything. They are so precious.  ♬

847
01:02:49,610 --> 01:02:52,570
♫  So make it count  ♫

848
01:02:52,570 --> 01:02:55,600
♬  Please remember today.  ♬

849
01:02:55,600 --> 01:02:58,840
♬ A light wind and blooming flowers  ♬

850
01:02:58,840 --> 01:03:03,770
♬  one minute one second make it count  ♬

851
01:03:03,770 --> 01:03:07,030
♬  Then  make me everlasting.  ♬

852
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:09,760
  Touch Your Heart  

853
01:03:09,760 --> 01:03:14,090
 - Something's suspicious.
 - I'm just saying she's okay as a secretary. 

854
01:03:14,090 --> 01:03:17,870
 This is a list of tasks that you will be doing in the future, Ms. Oh Jin Sim. 

855
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:21,600
 He said he was going to give me a chance to work properly, but he's sweating me. 

856
01:03:21,600 --> 01:03:24,320
 What do you think? No one will recognize you, right? 

857
01:03:24,320 --> 01:03:27,460
 - Oh, you can tell it's me?
 - Of course, I can. 

858
01:03:27,460 --> 01:03:29,890
 The witness is lying right now! 

859
01:03:29,890 --> 01:03:30,890
 What are you doing right now? 

860
01:03:30,890 --> 01:03:32,430
 Right! What are you doing? 

861
01:03:32,430 --> 01:03:34,560
 Hey! 

862
01:03:34,560 --> 01:03:35,660
 You should watch your words. 

863
01:03:35,660 --> 01:03:38,170
 What? Yoon Seo is arrested again? 

864
01:03:38,170 --> 01:03:41,350
 This is my first time seeing you smile that big. 

865
01:03:41,350 --> 01:03:42,490
 It's not a date. 

866
01:03:42,490 --> 01:03:45,810
 - Not, my butt.
 - We went to study. 

867
01:03:45,810 --> 01:03:48,910
♫  So make it count  ♫
