1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:05,720


2
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:40,920
 Touch Your Heart 

3
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,450
 Episode 14 

4
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:48,620
O-One moment!

5
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,240
Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok? He's not here right now.

6
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,690
I'm not in a position to disclose anything else.  I'm sorry.

7
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,750
It's starting up this morning again.

8
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:26,320
I wonder if we'll spend the whole day answering phones again.

9
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:28,460
The law firm's homepage is down, too.

10
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:31,590
At this rate, won't we be on the national bulletin board?

11
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:35,690
What should we do, seriously?! What's even worse, the number of our appointments has decreased.

12
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:40,060
Since this happened, not a single client has come in.

13
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:01,950
- Here is the schedule for this week. 
- Thank you.

14
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,880
Excuse me, CEO.

15
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:09,680
I was wondering how you'd feel about not being angry at Lawyer Kwon anymore.

16
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,470
What?

17
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:13,880
Anyway, it's his case.  Now, after this, he can't even retract

18
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:16,540
and Lawyer Kwon must not have anywhere his heart can be at ease.

19
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:20,270
So how much do you think he'd suffer when even you are being like this?

20
00:02:20,270 --> 00:02:22,730
Does it not look like I'm having a hard time?

21
00:02:22,730 --> 00:02:26,140
I'm looking at all this happening, so how do you think my heart feels?

22
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:29,500
He needs to know when he's as stubborn as that.

23
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:32,270
Five years ago, too, he...

24
00:02:32,270 --> 00:02:34,970
Never mind. Anyway,

25
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,360
the employee who committed the wrong should be the one to come and clear up the situation. Why should I?

26
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,790
What's so good about Lawyer Kwon that I'd do that?

27
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:42,860
Head out.

28
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:08,600
 Kwon Jeong Rok, lawyer for Im Yoon Hui case or Park Soo Myeong case? 

29
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,400
What is it?

30
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,000
I have something to tell you.

31
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,910
You were acting like you were never going to talk to me again.

32
00:03:25,910 --> 00:03:28,470
What is it? What do you have to tell me?

33
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:37,470
What is it? Is it a letter of apology?

34
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,730
It's my letter of resignation.

35
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:45,360
What did you say, Lawyer Kwon? Your letter of resignation?

36
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,410
Since I've taken on Park Soo Myeong's case,

37
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:52,740
it feels like I'm causing the company a huge loss.

38
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:56,800
So me quitting is the best way to not cause losses to the company andâ€”

39
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,510
So you're going to quit?

40
00:03:59,510 --> 00:04:03,850
You stir things up like this, then say it's over if you just run away?

41
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:08,620
Do you really believe that? Do you think that stopping right here is the best choice?

42
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:12,400
I'll wrap up the cases I'm in charge of well.

43
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:14,360
Hey!

44
00:04:15,850 --> 00:04:18,690
You really shouldn't do this.

45
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,270
You can't do this to me.

46
00:04:21,270 --> 00:04:22,600
I

47
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:27,040
have never thought of you as my employee.

48
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,720
You were just a junior that I  treasured, a younger brother that I trusted, and someone more important to me than family.

49
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:35,120
But you're saying that it's not enough for you to take on a case like this of your own volition,

50
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,990
so you're going to turn in a resignation letter?

51
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,120
Because of me, the law firm is receiving criticism that it has no reason to receive.

52
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,550
Work is paralyzed from receiving complaint calls and there aren't any new clients anymore.

53
00:04:45,550 --> 00:04:48,070
But I have to take on this case.

54
00:04:48,070 --> 00:04:53,120
I could have ruined someone's life, so I have to turn things back in any way possible.

55
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:00,450
I don't have any other option but this.

56
00:05:00,450 --> 00:05:02,790
Do what you want. Do what you want!

57
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:06,600
I don't need an irresponsible person like you anymore, so do as you please.

58
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,630
Whether you defend someone or turn in your resignation, you do as you please!

59
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:26,490
Defendant, Hong Jeong-soo, is a self-made businessman with assets of 5 billion won,

60
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:29,040
who is bitterly refusing a divorce

61
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:34,070
because he doesn't want to split assets with his wife.

62
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:39,750
So, his having rejected, I - I

63
00:05:41,170 --> 00:05:43,520
am making a demand.

64
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,960
 My wish is for you to be steadfast. 

65
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,540
 You'll do a great job, just as you have until now. 

66
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:02,960
 I believe that. 

67
00:06:17,970 --> 00:06:22,360
Ah, CEO Park? So you called because I asked you to recommend a lawyer to me.

68
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,120
Yeah, what happened?

69
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,300
Hey, things like skills aren't important to me.

70
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,900
They just have to be responsible.

71
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:33,750
Anyone's fine as long as they don't suddenly hand in a resignation letter and stab me in the back someday.

72
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:36,870
Yeah.

73
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:44,350
CEO, that's my phone.

74
00:06:44,350 --> 00:06:46,820
I know, I know, I know, I said.

75
00:06:52,350 --> 00:06:55,660
What should we do about this atmosphere?

76
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:08,940
 D-2 of Park Soo Myeong Appeal.  Has there been any action by Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok? 

77
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,590
I wonder if he's alright.

78
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:31,840
There's no one I can ask.

79
00:07:41,330 --> 00:07:45,180
I think that I got his phone number last time.

80
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:02,530
 Kim Se Won 

81
00:08:04,230 --> 00:08:06,360
- Yeah?
 -  Hey. Where are you? 

82
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,760
 Let's have a glass of alcohol. 

83
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,180
Forget it. I'm tired.

84
00:08:10,180 --> 00:08:12,580
 Actually, someone said that they wanted to meet with you. 

85
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:15,720
 They said they can't part with you like this. 

86
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,060
What do you mean?

87
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:31,430
Hey, over here.

88
00:08:35,720 --> 00:08:38,510
What are you doing instead of coming?

89
00:08:46,250 --> 00:08:48,370
Hey, sit down.

90
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,420
I was wondering what was up since Hyung got in touch with me suddenly.

91
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:00,620
You're not middle school students. Why are two grown men fighting?

92
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:04,550
Hey, Kwon Jeong Rok. I heard that you even turned in a letter of resignation.

93
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:10,570
It's not that I don't understand that you're quitting because you're inconveniencing the company.

94
00:09:10,570 --> 00:09:13,910
But you should resolve things with Hyung and how he feels first.

95
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:16,250
How could you erase everything and give him a resignation letter?

96
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:20,540
Now that I've heard it, nothing that Hyung said is wrong.

97
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:23,410
What's the big deal about him telling you not to take a risk on something that isn't even certain?

98
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:27,670
A CEO can't even say that much? Goodness, this stiff person.

99
00:09:27,670 --> 00:09:30,650
But I did speak a little too harshly.

100
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:34,770
I said that he'd get a stigma of being a lawyer who put on a show at trial.

101
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,980
A show? That's harsh.

102
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,990
This hyung is cruel.

103
00:09:40,990 --> 00:09:42,460
Forget it.

104
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:45,400
It's my fault for taking on a case as I wished without getting permission.

105
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:49,530
You took on the case without even getting the CEO's permission?

106
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:52,800
Hey, you're pretty gutsy.

107
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:57,450
He wouldn't have done that if I hadn't been so adamantly against it. Lawyer Kwon isn't someone who doesn't think things through. Forget it.

108
00:09:57,450 --> 00:10:00,910
Someone who knew that  insisted that he couldn't do it?

109
00:10:00,910 --> 00:10:03,950
This hyung is so frustrating, seriously.

110
00:10:05,060 --> 00:10:09,620
Are you helping us or provoking our anger? Pick a clear stance, you punk.

111
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:13,220
Was I doing that?

112
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:18,830
Anyway, now that I've listened to you, both of you were equally in the wrong.

113
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:22,520
That's what you call same-same, right?

114
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,660
Alright, here.

115
00:10:26,850 --> 00:10:29,660
So, hey.

116
00:10:29,660 --> 00:10:32,740
Make up, now. Do it.

117
00:10:33,530 --> 00:10:35,290
Ah, goodness.

118
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,060
What?

119
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:42,020
Aigo, this won't do. I'll get out of the way, so you two talk.

120
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,490
- Hey, forget it! It's not a blind date or something. 
- That's right. Leave later.

121
00:10:45,490 --> 00:10:50,130
Let go of me. No matter what happens in the end, you two talk it out and make up.

122
00:10:50,130 --> 00:10:52,320
I'm leaving.

123
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,200
Leave later. Hey, don't leave yet.

124
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,680
The jerk calls someone here and then...

125
00:11:02,630 --> 00:11:04,960
He's too much, seriously.

126
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,860
Aigo, seriously. That guy.

127
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,640
 Prosecutor Kim Se Won, 

128
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,620
 thank you for wrapping up the last incident well. 

129
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:26,060
 I still haven't been able to give you my greetings. 

130
00:11:26,060 --> 00:11:32,010
 That's one thing. Is Lawyer Kwon doing okay? 

131
00:11:38,330 --> 00:11:41,100
No. That's way too obvious.

132
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:46,120
No matter who looks at it, this is a message that's just wanting to know about Mr. Lawyer.

133
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:57,190
Because I've been asking so many people in law firms,  they will notice if I ask any further.

134
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:14,920
Lawyer Kwon.

135
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:21,760
Jeong Rok. Do you really not know me?

136
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:27,850
Do you think of me as someone who won't understand you til the end

137
00:12:27,850 --> 00:12:30,390
and will kick you out of the law firm?

138
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:32,820
Was the time that we've been together

139
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:36,390
so superficial that it only amounts to that much?

140
00:12:40,110 --> 00:12:42,290
I'm sorry.

141
00:12:42,290 --> 00:12:46,470
You said this, CEO. You asked me

142
00:12:46,470 --> 00:12:50,070
if I had the slightest sense of belonging or feeling of duty toward Always.

143
00:12:51,830 --> 00:12:54,440
You're completely right.

144
00:12:54,440 --> 00:13:00,290
I was selfish and arbitrary from the beginning to the end.

145
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:08,830
I started this so that my heart could feel comfortable and so that I could have a clear conscience.

146
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:14,880
I thought that it was right for me to take on any criticism alone.

147
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:19,080
So that I wouldn't inconvenience you or Always any further,

148
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,780
the best choice that I could make

149
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,890
was the resignation letter.

150
00:13:25,890 --> 00:13:27,710
I know.

151
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,460
I understand.

152
00:13:32,140 --> 00:13:35,760
I understand your motivation behind that.

153
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:41,410
But, I can't see you getting hurt any longer.

154
00:13:41,410 --> 00:13:45,690
I clearly know that you'll get hurt again just like you did five years ago.

155
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:51,410
Are you telling me to just take my hands off and watch you so you can go down that road?

156
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,330
Jeong Rok,

157
00:13:58,490 --> 00:14:02,270
do you know what my biggest regret in life is?

158
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:09,250
 Five Years Ago 

159
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:13,990
 I think that I'll have to stand on the victim's side. 

160
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,990
 I saw the victim's arguments. 

161
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:20,800
 The harmfulness of the disinfectant was confirmed. 

162
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,710
 Knowing that the research said that the chemical cleansers were harmless 

163
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,300
 the researchers changed all the experimental and environmental factors 

164
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,530
 to favor chemical cleansing. 

165
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:35,680
 Wait, this is... But  you are the attorney for Sejeong Chemical. 

166
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,840
 Does your CEO know about this? 

167
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:44,890
 I think the CEO also was involved in the manipulation of the experiment. 

168
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,290
 Hey. 

169
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:52,920
 You're not planning to inform the public, right? 

170
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:56,410
 That can't be. You're not. 

171
00:14:56,410 --> 00:14:58,820
 There are as many as 250 victims. 

172
00:14:58,820 --> 00:15:01,780
 Even if I am a corporate lawyer who's defending the corporation, 

173
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:05,090
 can't I have just a little bit of a conscience? 

174
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:07,540
 Hey, Kwon Jeong Rok. Are you insane? 

175
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:09,420
 Don't even have those ridiculous thoughts. 

176
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:11,990
 You know better than anyone what kind of company Daehan Law Firm is. 

177
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:15,510
 But you're... You're saying you're going to inform the public? 

178
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:19,840
 If you do that, it's over for you as a lawyer. 

179
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:24,230
 I'm scared, too. 

180
00:15:25,430 --> 00:15:29,620
 But I'm worried that if I act like I didn't see or hear anything like this 

181
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:32,330
 and just turn my head once or twice, 

182
00:15:33,550 --> 00:15:38,400
 I'll turn into a monster that feels no sense of guilt, just like those people. 

183
00:15:40,910 --> 00:15:43,090
 I'm more scared of that. 

184
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:53,060
 I would like to submit an application for the cancellation of your registration with the Korean Bar Association. 

185
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,860
 I think the breach of client confidentiality is a sufficient reason. 

186
00:15:56,860 --> 00:16:00,650
 Article 2 Paragraph 3 of the Attorney's Code of Ethics provides 

187
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:03,390
 that an attorney whether or not it's a breach of duty in the course of performance of his profession, 

188
00:16:03,390 --> 00:16:07,050
  shall not act against the public welfare. 

189
00:16:07,050 --> 00:16:12,260
 I will live as a lawyer keeping a sense of conscience. 

190
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:22,200
 Kwon Jeong Rok, that crazy punk. In the end, he... 

191
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:24,070
 Crazy bastard. 

192
00:16:31,360 --> 00:16:34,310
 Law Firm Audit Office 

193
00:16:34,310 --> 00:16:39,610
 Hello Sunbae.  I am Yeon  Joon Gyoo  from the 32nd class of the Judicial Research and Training Institute. 

194
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:43,740
 He's really competent and such a great lawyer. 

195
00:16:43,740 --> 00:16:47,270
 I can't just leave him to suffer at the hands of Daehan like this. 

196
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:50,080
 You're the one asking me, so of course I should help you, Lawyer Yeon. 

197
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,940
 Thank you. 

198
00:16:53,130 --> 00:16:55,970
 I will definitely pay back this favor. 

199
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,770
 Thank you. 

200
00:16:59,410 --> 00:17:01,950
The thing that I regret most in my life

201
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,990
is not being able to stop you five years ago.

202
00:17:07,620 --> 00:17:12,870
Because I saw how badly you fell apart clearly with my own two eyes.

203
00:17:15,620 --> 00:17:20,650
So, what's the best thing I ever did in my life?

204
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:24,830
It's watching you five years ago.

205
00:17:29,290 --> 00:17:31,630
You came to our law firm like that

206
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:34,030
and we made it through those difficulties together.

207
00:17:34,030 --> 00:17:36,070
We developed a relationship where we rely on each other

208
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:39,540
deep in our hearts, even if we don't say a lot.

209
00:17:40,170 --> 00:17:42,790
You held that kind of meaning to me.

210
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,620
But if you write your resignation letter and leave,

211
00:17:50,900 --> 00:17:53,500
what's left of my life?

212
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,300
So let's walk together.

213
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:05,480
I can't watch you go down like this.

214
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:09,360
So, no matter how hard it is,

215
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,590
let's go through it together.

216
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,170
Now ...

217
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,480
I will be steadfast.

218
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:29,650
Will the atmosphere be frigid today again?

219
00:19:29,650 --> 00:19:32,660
I know, right? It's so hostile.

220
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:35,100
Good morning!

221
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:37,280
Lawyer Dan and Office Manager,

222
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,900
we'll be having an emergency meeting in five minutes, so please get ready.

223
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:41,940
- Pil Gi, let attorney Choi know. 
 - Yes.

224
00:19:41,940 --> 00:19:44,490
But what do you mean by emergency meeting?

225
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,080
It involves saving someone's life.

226
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,100
When you say saving someone's life, who do you mean?

227
00:19:48,100 --> 00:19:51,390
Who do you mean? Our Lawyer Kwon, who has become hated by the whole country.

228
00:19:51,390 --> 00:19:53,740
- What do you mean, hated by the whole country? 
- Well it's true.

229
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:57,550
If you get this many hate calls and bad comments, then you're seriously hated by the whole country.

230
00:19:57,550 --> 00:20:00,040
- Get ready!
 - Yes, sir.

231
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,920
Work hard.

232
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:05,710
What's this?

233
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:08,290
It seemed like those two weren't going to see each other ever again just yesterday.

234
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,930
I know, right?

235
00:20:09,930 --> 00:20:11,750
Wait, what happened all of sudden

236
00:20:11,750 --> 00:20:14,500
that their two solidly frozen hearts melted?

237
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:17,010
They probably made up while having a glass of alcohol.

238
00:20:17,010 --> 00:20:19,490
- Let's get ready!
 - Cut!

239
00:20:23,990 --> 00:20:26,660
Cut! Okay! You worked hard!

240
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:30,640
- You worked hard!
 - Good work.

241
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,660
Yoon Seo, good work.

242
00:20:32,660 --> 00:20:35,830
Everyone worked hard! Let's go.

243
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:38,220
You worked hard!

244
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:54,210
 You did well. 

245
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:01,620
 You did well, Oh Jin Sim. 

246
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:06,800
Yoon Seo, what's wrong?

247
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:11,450
I just thought of Mr. Lawyer.

248
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:15,380
This is a place that I walked with Mr. Lawyer.

249
00:21:28,310 --> 00:21:30,360
Wait a second, Oppa.

250
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:35,130
Excuse me! Prosecutor Kim Se Won!

251
00:21:36,200 --> 00:21:39,680
Oh, Yoon Seo! What are you doing here?

252
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,770
I'm here for filming.

253
00:21:41,770 --> 00:21:44,510
But how did we end up meeting each other here?

254
00:21:44,510 --> 00:21:49,000
I actually wanted to get in touch with you once.

255
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,570
With me? What for?

256
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:55,770
Ah, that's... Last time,

257
00:21:55,770 --> 00:22:00,070
I wanted to thank you for taking care of the case with the stalker.

258
00:22:00,070 --> 00:22:02,680
Ah, because of that?

259
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:04,720
And also...

260
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:07,660
Just speak truthfully.

261
00:22:07,660 --> 00:22:10,130
You want to ask about Jeong Rok, don't you?

262
00:22:10,130 --> 00:22:13,010
As expected, you catch on quickly.

263
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:21,200
Um... How is Mr. Lawyer doing?

264
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:25,450
The public opinion is really bad. Is he okay?

265
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:27,290
Would he be?

266
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:31,370
After Jeong Rok took on that case, he hasn't been eating.

267
00:22:31,370 --> 00:22:34,390
I've been worried that he'd faint if he keeps this up.

268
00:22:36,420 --> 00:22:39,310
Yoon Seo, we have to go now!

269
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:42,910
We'll be late for your next appointment.

270
00:22:45,620 --> 00:22:48,630
- I'll go now.
 - Okay.

271
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:54,770
Um, please take care of Mr. Lawyer.

272
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:08,300
Did I say something unnecessary? She seems really worried.

273
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:13,090
Well,  I said it to make her worry.

274
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,380
On January 12, 2019, as she was being assaulted by her husband Kim Hyeong Tae,

275
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:22,210
she stabbed her husband and was indicted for this crime. This is Im Yoon Hui.

276
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,960
The prosecution found it suspicious that her father was declared dead in absentia

277
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:32,270
and that her ex-husband passed away in a fire.

278
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:34,740
This is because, right after they died, Im Yoon Hui

279
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:40,090
ended up receiving the money from the insurance policies that she was a beneficiary for.

280
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:44,110
The jury sentenced Park Soo Myeong to 20 years in prison

281
00:23:44,110 --> 00:23:46,400
and Im Yoon Hui was released on bail.

282
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,950
And currently, Im Yoon Hui has received 2.73 billion in insurance

283
00:23:49,950 --> 00:23:53,050
out of 4.94 billion and disappeared.

284
00:23:53,050 --> 00:23:55,070
You said that she disappeared.

285
00:23:55,070 --> 00:23:57,660
What was so urgent that she left without even receiving the full amount of insurance money?

286
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,700
It's definitely suspicious.

287
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:02,500
But isn't Park Soo Myeong making a new statement

288
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:04,300
that he only stabbed him once at this time?

289
00:24:04,310 --> 00:24:07,650
If it's true that Park Soo Myeong only stabbed him once as he said,

290
00:24:07,650 --> 00:24:11,000
then that means there is either another true culprit or an accomplice.

291
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:13,960
Do you have any leads?

292
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:16,010
As I was tracing Im Yoon Hui's whereabouts,

293
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,230
I've received proof that she came with an unknown man

294
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,390
on the day she came to get her insurance money.

295
00:24:21,390 --> 00:24:24,100
And Im Yoon Hui does not currently have any living family members.

296
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:25,940
Then ...?

297
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,010
It hasn't been that long since her husband died, but she's already...

298
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,310
It's not "already." This relationship could have been going on before he died.

299
00:24:34,310 --> 00:24:37,420
As you know, I'm the best lawyer in Korea

300
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:40,200
when it comes to cases involving love affairs and divorce.

301
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:43,190
My feeling is that it's an adulterous relationship.

302
00:24:43,190 --> 00:24:45,110
Wait a moment.

303
00:24:45,110 --> 00:24:48,750
You said that Im Yoon Hui's ex-husband passed away in a fire five years ago, didn't you?

304
00:24:48,750 --> 00:24:52,250
Then there is a possibility for suspicion that his death may have also been

305
00:24:52,250 --> 00:24:55,830
a crime linked to the man that she ran away with.

306
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:57,930
It's still just suspicion for now.

307
00:24:57,930 --> 00:25:01,770
I think that finding out the identity and personal information of the man in the CCTV is of first importance.

308
00:25:01,770 --> 00:25:06,620
Okay! Then, Office Manager, you uncover Im Yoon Hui's trail so we can trace her,

309
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:10,830
and thoroughly go through all of the CCTV footage that captured her movements.

310
00:25:10,830 --> 00:25:14,700
Those two will definitely have been filmed somewhere together.

311
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,960
I understand.

312
00:25:15,960 --> 00:25:21,410
But, CEO. It's been a long time since you've been in lawyer mode. You look heroic!

313
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:28,350
That's true. I forgot for a while there that you used to be a lawyer, CEO. Lawyer Yeon.

314
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:33,590
Calling me Lawyer Yeon. Lawyer Yeon.
  (Lawyer Yeon sounds like a curse word for "damn" in Korean) 

315
00:25:33,590 --> 00:25:36,510
Do you know why I opened this law firm?

316
00:25:36,510 --> 00:25:39,570
Prosecutor Yeon or Judge Yeon sounds really natural, doesn't it?

317
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:41,880
But when you put the word "lawyer" in front of Yeon, how does it sound?

318
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:46,980
It sounds like "damn it." It sounds like a curse word! I really hate curse words.

319
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:49,160
So instead of becoming Lawyer Yeon, I became CEO Yeon.

320
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:51,410
Ah, yes. Damn it.

321
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:53,350
Hey, hey!

322
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:58,600
Alright. Anway, if you think of anything else, let's meet again and talk about it.

323
00:25:58,600 --> 00:25:59,840
- Yes, sir.
 - Okay.

324
00:25:59,840 --> 00:26:04,770
- Good work. 
- Excuse me, Lawyer Kwon. If there's anything that I can help with, just tell me.

325
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:07,500
Yes. Thank you.

326
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:10,470
At times like this, it would be nice if he had a personal secretary like Yoon Seo.

327
00:26:10,470 --> 00:26:12,300
Do we need to get him a secretary?

328
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:15,110
But Secretary Hwang's only on maternity leave for three months,

329
00:26:15,110 --> 00:26:17,610
so I don't know about hiring another secretary.

330
00:26:17,610 --> 00:26:22,380
That's true. Then, what should we...? Ah, let's pick one of the interns.

331
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:28,200
Pil Se! Wait, me, Pil Gi! I can do better than Jeong Hwan. Please give me this opportunity.

332
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:32,630
I definitely can not miss this precious chance that will never come again.

333
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:34,050
Okay, do it. Do it.

334
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:36,640
I'm picking one person, and only one person applied just now.

335
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:40,610
It was difficult for you to pass. Seriously, congratulations. Let's get ready.

336
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,150
Yes, sir.

337
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:10,180
 Because I wanted to be helpful, I was researching  case precedent on  self-defense. 

338
00:27:10,180 --> 00:27:15,300
 You never know. I might see something that you can't see. 

339
00:27:16,170 --> 00:27:18,800
 I want to support you in any way I can. 

340
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:24,710
Yes.

341
00:27:27,100 --> 00:27:32,770
From today onward, Pil Gi will be supporting you as your personal helper.

342
00:27:32,770 --> 00:27:35,290
I'm Kim Pil Gi!

343
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:38,950
I wil become an Ace intern that is worthy of working with an Ace lawyer such as yourself.

344
00:27:38,950 --> 00:27:41,180
Please take care of me!

345
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:43,530
He's like this because he tends to go a little overboard. He works well.

346
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:46,870
- I'll leave you to him.
 - Yes, sir! Please head on!

347
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,000
Mr. Lawyer, what shall I do from now on?

348
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:55,490
If you tell me to find precedents, I'll look for them so hard that I'll stretch out my wrist ligaments.

349
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:02,690
As you said, please find some precedents.

350
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,970
Yes, sir. I will!

351
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:08,880
Mr. Lawyer, shall I help you with anything?

352
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,200
Ah, no.

353
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:12,240
Yes, sir! I understand!

354
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:29,260
Where are you going, Mr. Lawyer?

355
00:28:29,260 --> 00:28:32,410
I'll go to make some copies of records. There are some documents I need to look at.

356
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,440
Yes, sir. Please head on. I'll escort you out.

357
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,290
No, no.

358
00:28:36,290 --> 00:28:39,360
I'm fine. If a phone call comes in, leave me a memo.

359
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:43,370
And if you look in the drawer, there is a diary. You just have to look at that to acquaint yourself with your duties.

360
00:28:43,370 --> 00:28:48,960
Yes, sir. But, Mr. Lawyer.  It's almost lunch time. What about lunch?

361
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,730
Shall I go get you something and leave it here?

362
00:28:50,730 --> 00:28:53,560
I'm fine. I'll take care of it myself. Then.

363
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:56,020
Yes, sir! Have a safe trip.

364
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:08,340
Even if he is cornered, a tiger is a tiger.

365
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:12,020
To see how Lawyer Kwon will overcome this adversity,

366
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:15,070
I am going to observe directly with my own eyes

367
00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:18,130
and learn by sucking everything dry like a thrip.

368
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,470
Ah, right. The diary.

369
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,950
This is Secretary Oh's.

370
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:41,170
 After Jeong Rok took on that case, he hasn't been eating. 

371
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,160
 I've been worried that he might faint if he continues like this. 

372
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:52,380
Why are you sighing? Are you having trouble memorizing your lines?

373
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:55,930
Ah. I'm just a bit tired.

374
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:57,730
You're having a really tough time, aren't you, Yoon Seo?

375
00:29:57,730 --> 00:30:03,180
But we're done once we film this scene today, so let's go home and get some good sleep.

376
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,790
Okay.

377
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:12,960
Oh? This is the law firm.

378
00:30:13,960 --> 00:30:16,610
Yes, this is Oh Yoon Seo.

379
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:19,540
Ah, yes. Pil Gi.

380
00:30:19,540 --> 00:30:21,530
Why did you call?

381
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:23,430
Yes, that is...

382
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:27,560
I ended up personally assisting Lawyer Kwon today.

383
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:35,700
I was sitting in the desk that you were using, and I ended up finding

384
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:38,300
the ballpen that you left here. So if it's alright with you,

385
00:30:38,300 --> 00:30:42,600
can I keep this ballpen as a souvenir?

386
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:44,470
Do that.

387
00:30:47,290 --> 00:30:49,030
Wait a moment.

388
00:30:57,370 --> 00:30:58,600
Yes, Office Manager.

389
00:30:58,600 --> 00:31:05,390
 Well, I've been surveying by reviewing the CCTV photos, but there's nothing. 

390
00:31:06,540 --> 00:31:10,690
Yes, I understand. Yes.

391
00:31:18,700 --> 00:31:20,420
You're back, Mr. Lawyer?

392
00:31:20,420 --> 00:31:22,110
Yes, well.

393
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,550
Were there any special calls?

394
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:30,820
No, there were no special calls. But there's a special guest here instead.

395
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:35,570
That is... There was a ballpen that Secretary Oh used in the drawer.

396
00:31:35,570 --> 00:31:39,800
So I called her and she came to get her ballpen.

397
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:45,020
I told her over and over that I'd send it by courier,

398
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:50,160
but she said that she would come to get it in person since it was a really important ballpen to her.

399
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:52,810
So she ran in here.

400
00:31:54,520 --> 00:32:00,310
Ah, the CEO called me for something, so I'll go there now.

401
00:32:25,670 --> 00:32:30,540
That is... I came to get my ballpen.

402
00:32:31,820 --> 00:32:34,090
And say hello to you.

403
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:46,620
I left those papers for you.

404
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,310
Yes. I know.

405
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:54,940
Omo, then you didn't call to thank me even though you knew?

406
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:59,750
If you received it, you should have given your thanks.

407
00:33:02,830 --> 00:33:07,020
Compensate me. If you got such high-quality documents,

408
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:09,950
you should definitely compensate me for them.

409
00:33:09,950 --> 00:33:12,010
Civil Code Article 743.

410
00:33:12,010 --> 00:33:15,640
He who performs an act which benefits another without any obligation to do so,

411
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:18,990
is entitled to compensation.

412
00:33:20,710 --> 00:33:22,590
You're not unaware of that, right?

413
00:33:22,590 --> 00:33:26,920
So, in order to compensate me,

414
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,870
buy me a meal.

415
00:33:31,010 --> 00:33:36,340
If not, then shall I buy it?

416
00:33:37,150 --> 00:33:40,760
Of course, since I did something that you didn't even ask me to do,

417
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,640
you probably felt burdened.

418
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:48,480
So, I'll buy you a meal to apologize.

419
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,640
What should we eat?  Something nourishing for you.

420
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,290
Oh Jin Sim.

421
00:33:56,670 --> 00:34:02,090
Did you forget that we broke up?

422
00:34:08,490 --> 00:34:11,020
How could I forget that?

423
00:34:12,640 --> 00:34:16,400
I know. But...

424
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:23,000
I'm worried about you, Mr. Lawyer.

425
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,820
You're having a really hard time these days.

426
00:34:26,820 --> 00:34:31,180
My heart really hurt when I saw the articles.

427
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:38,530
When I was having a hard time, you were always by my side.

428
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:45,700
I can't do that,

429
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:51,640
since we're not in that kind of relationship anymore.

430
00:34:57,020 --> 00:35:01,080
But I still came. Even though I was worrying about what I would do if you didn't like it

431
00:35:01,080 --> 00:35:05,990
or if I put you in a troublesome position, I still came

432
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,850
because I wanted to eat with you.

433
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,720
I was worried that you would faint because you were only working and not eating.

434
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:19,800
You don't have to worry about that.

435
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:27,500
- What?
 - As you said, we're not in that kind of relationship.

436
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:31,940
Mr. Lawyer.

437
00:35:31,940 --> 00:35:35,010
So I hope that you won't worry about me

438
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:39,050
and just accomplish the work that you are supposed to do,

439
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:43,640
and forget about what happened here as quickly as possible.

440
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:46,680
â™«  Don't leave yet.  â™«

441
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:49,900
â™«  Don't let my hand go.  â™«

442
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:57,780
â™«  Don't stop the song which is  â™«

443
00:35:57,780 --> 00:36:04,850
â™«  ringing in my ears. There's still something  â™«

444
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:11,470
â™«  I haven't told you yet  â™«

445
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:18,070
â™«  I, who am not ready to let go of the left fingertip  â™«

446
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:25,770
â™«  which touched your small hand, still  â™«

447
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:33,070
â™«  cannot forget the eyes which looked   â™«

448
00:36:33,070 --> 00:36:39,870
â™«  and held each other  â™«

449
00:36:49,680 --> 00:37:00,080
â™«  Hold my hand.  â™«

450
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:09,460
What's with you? You didn't open the door for me even though you were home.

451
00:37:09,460 --> 00:37:11,380
Yoon Seo, I brought you

452
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:15,990
a restorative that's good for your body and abalone porridge which is even better.

453
00:37:17,130 --> 00:37:20,980
Why? Did something happen?

454
00:37:20,980 --> 00:37:24,550
- The memos were gone.
 - Huh?

455
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,280
I heard that Mr. Lawyer was having a really hard time these days,

456
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:33,620
and I was really worried about him,

457
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:40,300
so I went to see him today.  He didn't gaze at me warmly like he did before.

458
00:37:41,460 --> 00:37:45,050
And he even got rid of

459
00:37:46,530 --> 00:37:49,010
all the memos he wrote with me.

460
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:58,100
I guess he's really gotten over me now.

461
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:06,210
What do I do now?

462
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,900
But, why did Yoon Seo come here earlier?

463
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:23,450
Ah, I heard that she came to get her ballpen because she left it here.

464
00:38:23,450 --> 00:38:26,000
Such a busy person came all the way here because of that.

465
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:29,860
It must be a really important ballpen.

466
00:38:29,860 --> 00:38:32,740
I think I understand how she feels.

467
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:37,580
There are things that are important to you, even if it seems trivial to others.

468
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:42,200
Ah! When I was in elementary school, I went to my grandmother's house.

469
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:47,280
On my way I picked up this leaf bookmark.

470
00:38:47,280 --> 00:38:52,730
If I lose this, I think it would be really hard for me to handle my sorrow.

471
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:24,490
Mr. Lawyer.

472
00:39:26,710 --> 00:39:29,720
I did secure the CCTV footage,

473
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,420
but there's nothing significant in it yet.

474
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:35,880
Don't worry too much because I've asked all the people I knew when I was a detective.

475
00:39:38,870 --> 00:39:41,030
What's wrong?

476
00:39:41,030 --> 00:39:43,890
Because the picture that was used as proof is a little strange.

477
00:39:43,890 --> 00:39:45,560
What about it?

478
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:50,320
Blood splashed everywhere, enough to leave this much blood spatter.

479
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:55,780
But why are you Park Soo Myeong's clothes in such good condition?

480
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,500
If you look at the screen, the coat

481
00:40:05,500 --> 00:40:07,900
was worn by the defendant at the time of the crime.

482
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,350
As a result of the examination a small amount of the blood of the victim

483
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:12,180
Kim Hyeong Tae was found on the sleeve of the defendant.

484
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:14,640
This is the evidence that

485
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:17,910
Defendant Park Soo Myeong stabbed the victim with a knife.

486
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:23,580
It could be the evidence that he stabbed only once.

487
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:29,410
The fatal wound that led to the victim's death

488
00:40:29,410 --> 00:40:31,930
is the second stab wound to his chest.

489
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:35,260
The second knife stab tore the artery leading to the heart

490
00:40:35,260 --> 00:40:38,360
and he died due to excessive bleeding.

491
00:40:39,700 --> 00:40:44,390
As you can see from the murder scene photos, the floor and walls were covered with blood.

492
00:40:44,390 --> 00:40:46,870
It's because the moment the culprit stabbed him,

493
00:40:46,870 --> 00:40:48,780
the blood spurted like a water spout.

494
00:40:48,780 --> 00:40:50,820
But it's hard to understand  why there is so little blood

495
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:53,560
on the clothing worn by the alleged culprit

496
00:40:53,560 --> 00:40:56,220
who caused the fatal wound.

497
00:40:57,570 --> 00:41:01,170
Also, Im Yoon Hui who was released on bail from court

498
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:03,360
received a partial insurance payment of 2.73 billion won

499
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:07,430
out of a total of 4.94 billion and has currently disappeared.

500
00:41:08,060 --> 00:41:11,030
What is the reason that she gave up payment of  more than two billion remaining after the 2.73 billion

501
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,400
and suddenly disappeared?

502
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,140
Even so, the prosecution still investigated Park Soo Myeong.

503
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,990
Can you say they have proved beyond a reasonable doubt

504
00:41:21,990 --> 00:41:24,370
that he committed the crime as charged?

505
00:41:27,780 --> 00:41:30,680
Prosecutor, do you have an opinion?

506
00:41:35,220 --> 00:41:38,200
Respected Judge, I request a witness.

507
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,970
It is the sole witness of the crime scene,

508
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:53,600
- Im Yoon Hui.
- Noona!

509
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:07,350
 Witness Stand 

510
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:17,030
Witness, what is the reason that you weren't accepting any contact during this time?

511
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,710
Because I felt so confused,

512
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:24,420
so I took a short trip.

513
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:27,380
Is that so?

514
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:30,500
Then I will ask the witness, who was once a suspect in this case

515
00:42:30,500 --> 00:42:33,600
and is now the sole witness of the crime.

516
00:42:33,620 --> 00:42:38,990
Who is the criminal that stabbed the victim Kim Hyeong Tae twice by hand and killed him?

517
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:48,980
Soo Myeong.

518
00:42:51,090 --> 00:42:53,210
I'm sorry, Soo Myeong.

519
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,720
Noona, don't cry.

520
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:03,700
Witness, I'll ask you again. Is the one who stabbed the victim

521
00:43:03,700 --> 00:43:10,900
a total of two times, once in the chest and once in the stomach,

522
00:43:10,900 --> 00:43:15,100
the defendant sitting there, Park Soo Myeong?

523
00:43:17,570 --> 00:43:21,140
Yes, that's right.

524
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,700
That is all.

525
00:43:51,970 --> 00:43:52,910
Im Yoon Hui!

526
00:43:52,910 --> 00:43:55,780
Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok you claimed that Im Yoon Hui had gone into hiding.

527
00:43:55,780 --> 00:43:58,090
What do you think about the situation today when she appeared as a witness?

528
00:43:58,090 --> 00:44:00,550
Do you think that there is another true criminal or accomplice?

529
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:04,210
There is a lot of criticism about you representing Park Soo Myeong.

530
00:44:05,390 --> 00:44:07,400
What happened?

531
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:11,870
What do you mean, what happened? I took care of it cleanly.

532
00:44:12,830 --> 00:44:15,710
It's a relief that Im Yoon Hui contacted me right before the trial.

533
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:18,230
If she hadn't, something bad would have happened.

534
00:44:18,230 --> 00:44:19,830
Oh.

535
00:44:21,030 --> 00:44:23,900
But how were you suddenly able to get in touch with Im Yoon Hui?

536
00:44:23,900 --> 00:44:28,300
That is... She called personally saying that she wanted to stand as a witness.

537
00:44:32,600 --> 00:44:33,600
 Park Soo Myeong, who is the real culprit? 
Im Yoon Hui as a witness in the controversy. 

538
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:35,300
What happened with this?

539
00:44:35,360 --> 00:44:38,090
We were feeling at ease because we had definite evidence.

540
00:44:38,090 --> 00:44:42,350
I know, right? We never could have predicted that Im Yoon Hui would appear in court.

541
00:44:42,350 --> 00:44:46,250
But, what happened? Is Im Yoon Hui really innocent?

542
00:44:46,250 --> 00:44:48,620
Didn't she come to court because she had nothing to hide?

543
00:44:48,620 --> 00:44:54,690
I don't know.  The bottom line is that public opinion is even worse than before.

544
00:44:57,050 --> 00:44:59,470
 Park Soo Myeong's case, Im Yoon Hui's witness takes the stand. 

545
00:44:59,470 --> 00:45:01,860
 Kwon Jeong Rok cornered lawyer. 

546
00:45:05,750 --> 00:45:11,170
Yoon Seo, stop looking. If you keep looking, you're just making it harder for yourself.

547
00:45:28,850 --> 00:45:31,580
This just won't do.

548
00:45:31,580 --> 00:45:33,580
Yoon Seoâ€” No.

549
00:45:33,580 --> 00:45:37,400
First, slap me really hard right here!

550
00:45:37,400 --> 00:45:41,270
- What the heck? What are you saying all of a sudden? 
 - No, I need to be hit.

551
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:45,360
I did something to you worth getting hit for.

552
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:51,430
Actually, Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok didn't break up with you because he doesn't like you.

553
00:46:11,440 --> 00:46:15,290
- Yes, Office Manager. 
 - I got the CCTV footage. 

554
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,240
It's near the bank where she went to get the insurance money.

555
00:46:22,240 --> 00:46:25,550
If it was on February 27th at five o'clock, then it's the right day.

556
00:46:25,550 --> 00:46:32,100
This one has the clearest video quality, but it will still be hard to identify his face.

557
00:46:37,740 --> 00:46:39,720
Why are you like that?

558
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:49,190
I couldn't find anything that his face showed up clearly in. But look at this.

559
00:46:50,260 --> 00:46:52,520
Is it possible to get his fingerprints from this?

560
00:46:52,520 --> 00:46:55,200
I think it would be possible to discern it based on the location.

561
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:57,250
I think it'll be enough.

562
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:07,750
 That person didn't leave you because he doesn't like you. 

563
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:11,680
 He did it because he likes you and treasures you so much. 

564
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:15,850
 Let's... 

565
00:47:19,540 --> 00:47:21,690
 break up. 

566
00:47:21,690 --> 00:47:23,700
 Is it because you feel betrayed now that you think about it? 

567
00:47:23,700 --> 00:47:29,170
 If not that, is it because it's burdensome to have people staring at you? 

568
00:47:29,170 --> 00:47:35,620
 Because of those reasons that you stated, I thought that it would be too much to date you anymore. 

569
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:41,280
 So, I think it would best for us to stop here. 

570
00:47:44,330 --> 00:47:46,640
That wasn't it.

571
00:48:01,800 --> 00:48:04,970
â™«   Full of something I don't know  â™«

572
00:48:04,970 --> 00:48:10,870
â™«   Honestly for me it's difficult umm  â™«

573
00:48:10,870 --> 00:48:14,250
â™«  Timing is what it is  â™«

574
00:48:14,250 --> 00:48:18,720
â™«  Why did it get twisted on it's own?  â™«

575
00:48:19,800 --> 00:48:22,000
Are you leaving for work now, Mr. Lawyer?
â™«  My slow moving heart  â™«

576
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:25,800
- Why are you here?
 - I packed you a lunch.

577
00:48:25,800 --> 00:48:28,300
Here.

578
00:48:28,300 --> 00:48:31,300
Enjoy it. 
â™«  Within a footstep's reach  â™«

579
00:48:32,000 --> 00:48:36,400
Don't skip meals.

580
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,100
Oh Jin Sim.

581
00:48:38,100 --> 00:48:40,400
It's time for me to go filming! I need to leave quickly.

582
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:46,000
Eat well and gain some strength so you can do the trial properly. 
â™«  love is What is it? What is love?  â™«

583
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,000
You have to make sure you eat it all.

584
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:54,800
â™«  How should I say it?  What if love?  â™«

585
00:48:54,800 --> 00:48:56,800
â™«  Probably for me it's you  â™«

586
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:00,600
â™«  one one one my one  â™«

587
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:05,300
â™«  the only one one one you are  â™«

588
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,310
Mr. Lawyer, do you want to have lunch with me? 
â™«  If this is love love love if love  â™«

589
00:49:09,310 --> 00:49:14,100
I found a restaurant over there that doesn't have many people. Let's go together.

590
00:49:21,450 --> 00:49:23,050
Really, why are you doing this?

591
00:49:23,050 --> 00:49:27,040
If you keep suddenly showing up like this, what are you going to do if your picture gets taken

592
00:49:27,040 --> 00:49:30,690
or a scandal breaks out? As I told you,

593
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:34,300
- forget what happened here as quickly as possible andâ€”
 - I don't want to forget it.

594
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:38,900
I'm the one who decides whether I forget it or not.

595
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:42,710
I'm going to do what I want and  not  forget you, Mr. Lawyer.

596
00:49:42,710 --> 00:49:45,000
And I'm going to miss you

597
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:51,600
and come to see you if I'm worried about you. If I want to see you, I'm going to come see you.

598
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:10,230
Soo Myeong.

599
00:50:11,820 --> 00:50:14,220
You're having a really hard time, aren't you?

600
00:50:15,750 --> 00:50:17,410
I'm sorry, Soo Myeong.

601
00:50:17,410 --> 00:50:21,180
Noona, don't cry. Noona, don't cry. Don't cry, Noona.

602
00:50:21,180 --> 00:50:25,960
My Soo Myeong became like this while trying to save me.

603
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,520
Soo Myeong.

604
00:50:34,780 --> 00:50:38,720
Do you remember the day that you came to Noona's house that time?

605
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:43,840
I stabbed him. So I saved you, Noona, because I stabbed him.

606
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,900
That's right.

607
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:48,140
You saved me.

608
00:50:48,140 --> 00:50:54,840
But, Soo Myeong, do you really not remember that you stabbed him twice that time?

609
00:50:54,840 --> 00:50:58,900
No, Noona! Noona, I stabbed him once.

610
00:50:58,900 --> 00:51:02,270
Noona, I stabbed him once.

611
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:08,950
No.

612
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:12,680
You stabbed him twice.

613
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,570
You killed him.

614
00:51:24,100 --> 00:51:26,700
 Yeo Reum. 

615
00:51:30,470 --> 00:51:34,820
- Hey, Yeo Reum.
  - I got the results from the fingerprint analysis. 

616
00:51:34,820 --> 00:51:38,900
 But it's a bit strange. It was a dead person's fingerprint. 

617
00:51:38,900 --> 00:51:43,340
What? A dead person's fingerprint?

618
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,070
Choi Sang Ho. He has three convictions for assault and one for fraud.

619
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:52,230
Choi Sang Ho?

620
00:51:53,170 --> 00:51:55,370
- That person...
 - That's right.

621
00:51:55,370 --> 00:51:58,150
He's Im Yoon Hui's ex-husband.

622
00:51:58,880 --> 00:52:01,870
Fingerprint Identification Result

623
00:52:03,980 --> 00:52:05,880
Im Yoon Hui's ex-husband was alive?

624
00:52:05,880 --> 00:52:08,090
Yeah. They switched corpses.

625
00:52:08,090 --> 00:52:12,290
The person who died in the fire wasn't Choi Sang Ho.

626
00:52:12,290 --> 00:52:16,740
Im Yoon Hui and Choi Sang Ho.  There is a wanted fugitive lookout posted.

627
00:52:20,020 --> 00:52:22,030
Look at the video with me.

628
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:27,520
The man in the video is the person who went to get the insurance money with Im Yoon Hui.

629
00:52:28,360 --> 00:52:32,190
From this glass wall we were able to get fingerprints for the man.

630
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:35,700
The results of the fingerprint analysis revealed the man's identity.

631
00:52:35,700 --> 00:52:41,880
It was revealed that this man is none other than Im Yoon Hui's late husband, Choi Sang Ho.

632
00:52:41,880 --> 00:52:45,660
How is something like this possible? How

633
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:48,610
is a dead person living and walking around?

634
00:52:48,610 --> 00:52:53,710
Im Yoon Hui's ex-husband Choi Sang Ho, who was known to have died in a fire, was alive

635
00:52:53,710 --> 00:52:57,020
and he was an active participant in Im Yoon Hui's criminal act.

636
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:02,680
In addition, I've tried to identify the burned body.

637
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:09,320
From comparing the dental records of the people around Im,

638
00:53:09,320 --> 00:53:12,930
we were able to confirm the real identity of the corpse.

639
00:53:16,210 --> 00:53:21,920
It was none other than Im Yoon Hui's father who was known to be missing, Im Ho Joong.

640
00:53:48,170 --> 00:53:50,150
Choi Sang Ho.

641
00:53:51,830 --> 00:53:54,030
That is you, correct?

642
00:53:55,530 --> 00:54:00,410
You know that you're the top suspect in Kim Hyeong Tae's murder, don't you?

643
00:54:02,300 --> 00:54:06,500
You do have the right to remain silent, but if you stay still like this,

644
00:54:06,500 --> 00:54:11,300
all of the punishments for the crime will be placed on you.

645
00:54:11,300 --> 00:54:17,290
Im Yoon Hui is saying that all of these crimes were committed by you.

646
00:54:17,290 --> 00:54:20,510
No! That woman...

647
00:54:20,510 --> 00:54:23,460
That woman made me do it! I'm a victim too!

648
00:54:23,460 --> 00:54:28,510
Then shall we start with Kim Hyung Tae's murder case?

649
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,750
What in the world happened?

650
00:54:32,750 --> 00:54:35,120
 Noona! 

651
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:40,130
 A week before the crime, Yoon Hui used a delivery as an excuse to call Park Soo Myeong to the house. 

652
00:54:40,130 --> 00:54:43,710
 Thank you again, today. She showed herself being abused 

653
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:45,640
 she kept repeating this over and over. 

654
00:54:45,640 --> 00:54:51,900
 I wish someone would kill him in my place. 

655
00:54:51,900 --> 00:54:54,090
 That bastard! That jerk! 

656
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:57,540
 She kept saying that she wished someone would kill him in her place. 

657
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,170
 Soo Myeong. 

658
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,350
 Soo Myeong, come to your senses. 

659
00:55:11,510 --> 00:55:17,020
-  Noona. 
 -  From now on, listen to me well. You were never here today. 

660
00:55:17,020 --> 00:55:21,090
 You didn't see anything, nor did you do anything. Do you understand? 

661
00:55:21,090 --> 00:55:23,340
 You can't tell anyone about this. 

662
00:55:23,340 --> 00:55:25,590
 You can promise me, right? 

663
00:55:26,620 --> 00:55:27,970
 Noona. 

664
00:55:27,970 --> 00:55:31,370
 Go. Hurry up and go. 

665
00:55:46,460 --> 00:55:48,930
 It's over. Come out. 

666
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,200
 Why did you let him go? If you used his hands to kill, then you should call the police immediately. 

667
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:04,030
 Are you crazy? 

668
00:56:04,030 --> 00:56:06,380
 Then, the police will suspect me, too.  

669
00:56:06,380 --> 00:56:08,920
 Don't you know that it's even more suspicious when you are at the crime scene? 

670
00:56:08,920 --> 00:56:11,070
 I'll confess first. 

671
00:56:11,070 --> 00:56:14,820
 Then, I'll get sympathy when he gets revealed as the real culprit., 

672
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,590
 and I won't be suspected of insurance fraud. 

673
00:56:19,360 --> 00:56:24,390
 It's done, so get lost. I called you just in case, but I didn't need you. 

674
00:56:24,390 --> 00:56:25,940
 I understand. 

675
00:56:43,100 --> 00:56:44,850
 Give it to me. 

676
00:56:48,590 --> 00:56:52,180
 I'll take care of this, so don't even come near here in the future. 

677
00:56:52,180 --> 00:56:54,290
 Don't contact me either. 

678
00:57:01,260 --> 00:57:04,270
 Ms. Im Yoon Hui who underwent trial as a suspect for her husband's murder, 

679
00:57:04,270 --> 00:57:08,780
 this time, she is being arrested and indicted of instigating murder and of parricide by the prosecutor. 

680
00:57:08,780 --> 00:57:13,770
 Ms. Im and her ex-husband instigated the murder of her current husband Kim Hyeong Tae. 

681
00:57:13,770 --> 00:57:16,810
 She killed her father and disguised it as a fire incident, 

682
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:22,710
 where she lied that by saying it was her ex-husband's corpse, getting both her father and her ex-husband's life insurance. 

683
00:57:22,710 --> 00:57:26,490
So, her father didn't disappear, but rather she murdered him.

684
00:57:26,490 --> 00:57:28,150
And her ex-husband didn't die in a fire,

685
00:57:28,150 --> 00:57:32,150
she set her father's body on fire and lied saying that it was her ex-husband.

686
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,940
And she got both of their life insurance.

687
00:57:34,940 --> 00:57:37,440
And then she gambled that money away

688
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:42,440
with her ex-husband and didn't have enough left, so she approached a new man and committed another murder.

689
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:45,630
How can there be such an atrocious person?

690
00:57:45,630 --> 00:57:50,130
Anyway, I'm glad that Im Yoon Hui was revealed as the villain in all of this.

691
00:57:50,130 --> 00:57:53,230
And our Lawyer Kwon who revealed the truth became a star.

692
00:57:53,230 --> 00:57:57,120
That's right. In the end, Lawyer Kwon did it.

693
00:57:58,020 --> 00:58:00,190
Where did CEO go?

694
00:58:00,190 --> 00:58:04,690
Ah... He said he had a phone interview, so he's busy.

695
00:58:04,690 --> 00:58:06,580
An interview?

696
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:11,560
Hello, I am Lawyer Kwon's sole mentor

697
00:58:11,560 --> 00:58:16,090
and his role model, CEO Yeon Joon Gyoo.

698
00:58:16,090 --> 00:58:18,560
Alright! Now.

699
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:22,480
Yes. Oh, about Lawyer Kwon?

700
00:58:22,480 --> 00:58:26,500
He's an extremely skilled junior of mine

701
00:58:26,500 --> 00:58:31,190
who has followed in my righteous and honest footsteps.

702
00:58:31,190 --> 00:58:36,720
In this case, Lawyer Kwon understood our company motto well.

703
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:40,350
So, I am personally very very proud of him.

704
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:43,480
Our company Always' motto is

705
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:47,220
to seek the truth and to implement justice.

706
00:58:47,220 --> 00:58:51,300
Of course, that was made by me, Yeon Joon Gyoo.

707
00:58:53,100 --> 00:58:57,440
You said that this is enough? I still have a little bit left to say, though.

708
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:02,960
Are you not curious about about the growth and background of this admirable CEO?

709
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,380
Don't you want to know about my ideal type or any plans for a broadcast appearanceâ€” Hello?

710
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,150
Hello?

711
00:59:09,860 --> 00:59:14,120
Why did they hang up? I don't understand.

712
00:59:14,120 --> 00:59:16,160
I'll call them again.

713
00:59:19,380 --> 00:59:22,280
 Witness record 

714
00:59:24,650 --> 00:59:27,300
Lawyer Kwon, on a day like this, we should go drink a glass.

715
00:59:27,300 --> 00:59:29,790
Is there something you want to eat? I'll buy you anything.

716
00:59:29,790 --> 00:59:34,450
Rib-eye steak? Lobster? Sawedged perch? Bouquet of hot bars? Just tell me, I'll buy it for you.

717
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:37,800
Later. I'm quite tired today.

718
00:59:37,800 --> 00:59:42,160
Of course, on a day like today, you should rest since you couldn't sleep for a few days.

719
00:59:42,160 --> 00:59:46,650
Then, I'll let you off, but next time we need to drink a lot.

720
00:59:46,650 --> 00:59:48,380
I'll go now.

721
00:59:50,270 --> 00:59:58,340


722
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:10,700
 But, can I ask you something? 

723
01:00:10,700 --> 01:00:15,760
 You said that you weren't going to the team dinner because you're tired. 

724
01:00:15,800 --> 01:00:20,700
 Why did you ask me to drink soju with you? 

725
01:00:20,700 --> 01:00:23,300
 Today, for some reason, 

726
01:00:24,720 --> 01:00:28,510
 I just wanted to have a glass with just the two of us. 

727
01:00:30,680 --> 01:00:35,960
â™«  I want everything everywhere to come to a halt  â™«

728
01:00:35,960 --> 01:00:40,200
 Mr. Lawyer, we should have a glass of soju today, shouldn't we? 

729
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:44,560
 What about the potato soup restaurant that we ate at last time after you won a case? 

730
01:00:44,560 --> 01:00:49,220
â™«  which won't leave my head all day.  â™«

731
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,200
One potato soup.

732
01:00:53,200 --> 01:00:54,920
Yes.

733
01:00:57,560 --> 01:01:02,150
â™«  don't know anything  and I'm just smiling  â™«

734
01:01:04,290 --> 01:01:07,810
Welcome! 
   â™«  Because of my foolish pride  â™«

735
01:01:07,810 --> 01:01:11,020
â™«  Only a deeper would was left.  â™«

736
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:14,840
â™«  I'm sorry.  Why was it then   â™«

737
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:17,480
Mr. Lawyer. 
 â™«  Why did I only know myself?  â™«

738
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:19,910
â™«  Photographs which are in my hand  â™«

739
01:01:19,910 --> 01:01:22,030
Come see me for a moment.

740
01:01:22,030 --> 01:01:23,710
â™«  You are only smiling in them  â™«

741
01:01:23,710 --> 01:01:28,210
â™«  You won't come back again  â™«

742
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:35,100
â™«  You won't come back again  â™«

743
01:01:43,090 --> 01:01:47,410
Oh Jin Sim, why are you doing this?

744
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:49,690
What am I doing?

745
01:01:49,690 --> 01:01:53,980
Don't you know that we can't do this anymore?

746
01:01:53,980 --> 01:01:58,290
No, I  don't know why we have to do that.

747
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,550
I heard everything.

748
01:02:02,550 --> 01:02:08,160
I heard why you ended up abandoning me.

749
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:15,610
There were several difficult things that happened.

750
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:20,760
But I was able to get through all of them because  I was with you.

751
01:02:23,120 --> 01:02:26,200
And I became stronger as I did that.

752
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,830
Rather than losing another chance because of a scandal,

753
01:02:31,830 --> 01:02:37,320
I'm more scared of you disappearing from my side, Mr. Lawyer.

754
01:02:37,320 --> 01:02:39,350
So...

755
01:02:42,550 --> 01:02:45,310
if you're really doing it for my sake,

756
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:51,290
then please stay by my side.

757
01:02:56,330 --> 01:02:59,020
Let's start over.

758
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:14,860
Are you really not going to hold on to me, even if I do this?

759
01:03:18,220 --> 01:03:20,610
Even if you won't ever be able to see me again

760
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:25,560
if you let me go like this?

761
01:03:54,360 --> 01:03:56,420
Oh Jin Sim.

762
01:04:05,430 --> 01:04:07,470
I love you.

763
01:04:19,110 --> 01:04:22,000
â™«  Time, time   â™«

764
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,480
â™«   is mystical  â™«

765
01:04:24,480 --> 01:04:27,170
â™«  You regret after it has passed.  â™«

766
01:04:27,170 --> 01:04:29,650
â™«   Oh, it's sad 

767
01:04:29,650 --> 01:04:32,970

â™«  even if it's clear  â™«

769
01:04:35,300 --> 01:04:38,390
â™«  In a short instant  â™«

770
01:04:38,390 --> 01:04:40,880
â™«  it soon fades and disappears again  â™«

771
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:44,020
â™«  La La  â™«

772
01:04:44,020 --> 01:04:46,990
â™«  Here you and me  â™«

773
01:04:46,990 --> 01:04:49,630
â™«  Now to this moment  â™«

774
01:04:49,630 --> 01:04:52,490
â™«  I'm trying to put and hold   â™«

775
01:04:52,490 --> 01:04:54,870
â™«  In a place deep in my heart  â™«

776
01:04:54,870 --> 01:04:57,600
â™«  In a place deep in my heart  â™«

777
01:04:57,600 --> 01:05:00,330
â™«  today's air also   â™«

01:05:05,820 --> 01:05:08,760
â™«  so make it count  â™«

781
01:05:08,760 --> 01:05:11,830
â™«  Please remember today  â™«

782
01:05:11,830 --> 01:05:15,040
â™«  A light wind and blooming flowers  â™«

 Touch Your Heart
 ~ Preview ~ 

784
01:05:19,030 --> 01:05:20,800
 I don't want to go home 

785
01:05:20,800 --> 01:05:22,770
 because I want to keep seeing you. 

786
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:23,930
 An advising lawyer? 

787
01:05:23,930 --> 01:05:24,840
 No one wants to do it, right? 

788
01:05:24,840 --> 01:05:25,770
 I'll do it. 

789
01:05:25,770 --> 01:05:27,420
 Seriously, why are you like this? So annoying. 

790
01:05:27,420 --> 01:05:29,630
 Even if it's just for your sake, 

791
01:05:29,630 --> 01:05:33,290
 I think we have to date secretly even more carefully from now on. 

792
01:05:33,290 --> 01:05:37,030
 Date secretly even more carefully? 

793
01:05:37,030 --> 01:05:38,960
 Even if he is your manager, your private life is... 

794
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:42,000
 Hey Yoon Seo, I'll use the bathroom one time. 

795
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:43,230
 Oppa! 

796
01:05:43,230 --> 01:05:46,570
 How is the atmosphere between Yoon Seo and the male lead? 

797
01:05:46,570 --> 01:05:47,920
 Kiss master? 

798
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,120
 There was a kiss scene in this, wasn't there? 

799
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:54,100
 For some reason, I think there's a possibility of those two dating through this drama. 

800
01:05:54,100 --> 01:05:58,150
 I will help you to the best of my ability to practice. Is this how you do it? 

801
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:02,280
â™«  I want to whisper to your heart  â™«
