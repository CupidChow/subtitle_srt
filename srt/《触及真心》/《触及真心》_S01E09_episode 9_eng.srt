1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:04,990


2
00:00:07,430 --> 00:00:08,960
 MISSING
 SHE'S GONE Yoon Seo. Oh! 

3
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,230
 Call 

4
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,160
 Touch Your Heart 

5
00:00:35,970 --> 00:00:40,930
 Touch Your Heart 

6
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,430
 Episode 9  
 I'm really upset.

7
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:49,190
I would accept it if the criticism were justified, but

8
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:53,920
they said that they wouldn't eat our macaron even if we paid them to eat it, that they got a stomach ache.

9
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,590
If someone writes something false like that, what can we do about it?

10
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:01,910
This power blog or whatever, I can sue everyone who commented too, right?

11
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:03,180
Definitely.

12
00:01:03,180 --> 00:01:06,670
You can sue them for libel for publishing false information.

13
00:01:06,670 --> 00:01:10,270
First, file a criminal complaint and as the injured party,

14
00:01:10,270 --> 00:01:13,410
ask for compensation for damages along with it through a civil case.

15
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,000
I only have nightmares nowadays.

16
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,560
It's enough to make me respect the celebrities we see on TV.

17
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,560
I don't know how they can keep from lashing out at vicious comments.

18
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:32,210
But, I guess that secretary must love macarons.

19
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:38,430
Please screenshoot and send all the problematic comments.

20
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:43,140
We will draw up the complaint and send it to you. And if there aren't any special opinions, we will go ahead and file it.

21
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,670
Alright.

22
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,920
Thank you for buying me so many.

23
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,710
I became a total macaron chaebol thanks to you.

24
00:01:57,710 --> 00:02:02,420
Try them and let me know objectively what you think.

25
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,370
If they're really as terrible as the comments say.

26
00:02:06,370 --> 00:02:07,890
Ohhh.

27
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:11,610
That's why you took me along, for macaron evaluation.

28
00:02:11,610 --> 00:02:15,070
Fine with me, I'm confident. I really like macarons.

29
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:19,570
But no matter how much you like them, are you going to be able to eat that many alone?

30
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:22,020
Why would I eat this alone?

31
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,180
I'll taste exactly one, and share the rest with our law firm colleagues.

32
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:28,080
I'm a loyal woman.

33
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:33,110
Only loyal? You're also charming and affectionate.

34
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:37,090
Who are you?

35
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:40,560
Our lawyer isn't the type of person to say such sweet things.

36
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:43,070
Who are you, I asked?

37
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:46,630
Kidding, just kidding.

38
00:02:46,630 --> 00:02:51,090
Your words didn't sound like something you would say, I just couldn't believe it.

39
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,710
Please make such compliments often in the future.

40
00:02:54,710 --> 00:02:56,330
Yes, well.

41
00:02:56,330 --> 00:02:59,510
Aren't you going to eat a macaron?

42
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:02,940
What shall I eat? The names are so unusual.

43
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:06,270
"Why do I feel like eating this again? Mocha macaron"

44
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:09,810
"It tastes good, looks good, choco macaron."

45
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:13,660
"A mint macaron that calls for a kiss."

46
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:18,230
A taste that calls for a kiss, I wonder what that tastes like.

47
00:03:34,070 --> 00:03:36,150
- We are back. 
 - Welcome back.

48
00:03:36,150 --> 00:03:37,930
You're back?

49
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:43,980
Tada. Lawyer Kwon bought us some macarons.

50
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:46,240
- Oh, wow, it looks tasty. 
 - Take whatever you like.

51
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,290
Then I'll take the strawberry.

52
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:50,180
I'll take choco.

53
00:03:50,180 --> 00:03:54,080
Then I'll take Earl Grey, that makes you want to shout out, "Earl Grey."

54
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,580
Yoon Seo should have this one.

55
00:03:56,580 --> 00:03:59,690
"A mint macaron that calls for a kiss."

56
00:04:00,590 --> 00:04:04,450
Seriously. I don't have any wish to call for a kiss.

57
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:07,180
What are you saying?

58
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:20,140
Ah, Mr. Lawyer.  Is there something you need?

59
00:04:20,140 --> 00:04:22,600
From now on, I'm not asking.

60
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,280
Pardon?

61
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,680
What ...

62
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:29,460
 Since you told me not to ask. 

63
00:04:33,180 --> 00:04:36,040
You're not going to ask ... here?

64
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,210
Here at the office?

65
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,160
- Yes. 
 - Oh.

66
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:45,230
I've always checked to see if you served the judgment.

67
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:48,950
I know you do it well.  So I won't ask anymore.

68
00:04:48,950 --> 00:04:54,910
Oh. I'm getting sleepy.  I need a cup of coffee.

69
00:04:58,300 --> 00:05:01,270
I'm crazy. Crazy.  No matter how nice it was, this isn't right!

70
00:05:01,270 --> 00:05:05,290
My goodness, what am I saying? What am I calling nice?

71
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:08,680
Well, it  was  nice.

72
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:13,570
In any case,  this is the sacred workplace, huh?

73
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,270
Oh Yoon Seo.  Let's focus on  our work. Focus, huh?  Focus!

74
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,300
Here's the data you asked for.

75
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,890
Yes.

76
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:33,060
Just like the president said, there are a lot of bad comments.

77
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:35,570
Even though the macarons are high quality,

78
00:05:35,570 --> 00:05:38,820
they are  writing  both nasty emotionally charged ratings about the taste

79
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:43,370
and speculation that the president is lying about coming out of a German confectionary.

80
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,050
I think the president is truly upset.

81
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:50,420
Because I also have had many encounters with malicious comments before,

82
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:53,420
I totally understand how he feels.

83
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:58,440
It doesn't matter if I tell myself that I shouldn't worry about it and stay cool

84
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,950
one hundred times or one thousand times.

85
00:06:01,950 --> 00:06:06,620
Some of the words are embedded so deeply into my heart

86
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:12,020
that I haven't forgotten them to this day and I'll suddenly feel twinges.

87
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:14,150
Why didn't you sue?

88
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:18,030
As a matter of fact, I did sue.

89
00:06:18,030 --> 00:06:23,960
But when I met them in reality, one was a student and another was the family breadwinner.

90
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:27,210
I felt somewhat bad.

91
00:06:27,210 --> 00:06:32,150
So I gave them the benefit of the doubt and accepted promises that they would never do it again.

92
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,480
Oh, there's a call.

93
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,850
Exactly how many malicious comments did you get?

94
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,510
 Oh Yoon Seo 

95
00:06:53,930 --> 00:06:56,420
Sue immediately!

96
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,990
Pardon? What?

97
00:06:57,990 --> 00:07:00,400
I searched comments on Oh Jin Sim.

98
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,040
Those malicious comments are insulting exceeding the standard and criminal.

99
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:07,300
Such people need to understand what terrible things happened at their own fingertips.

100
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:11,190
I think they need to pay large damages so immediately sue and ...

101
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,080
Why are you laughing?  I'm being serious right now.

102
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:20,080
Oh, because I like it.

103
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:23,900
What? What do you like?

104
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:26,540
Well, you know how it is.

105
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:29,900
Doing an emotionless analysis every time...

106
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:37,500
The lawyer who does this is now angry because of me. Like it's happening to you.

107
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:41,570
From now on, Oh Jin Sim's problems are my problems.

108
00:07:49,350 --> 00:07:54,530
I am truly okay.   Thank you for worrying about me.

109
00:07:58,260 --> 00:08:00,090
Yoon Seo,  dinner with ...

110
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,660
What!

111
00:08:03,660 --> 00:08:06,120
All right!  I said all right!

112
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,550
The judicial precedents? All I have to do is find them!

113
00:08:09,550 --> 00:08:14,510
What's so important about them that you push a person to the limit like this? What?

114
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:17,380
I got the timing wrong.

115
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:20,810
I hope that you two can resolve the conflict as much as possible.

116
00:08:23,430 --> 00:08:25,410
Mr. Lawyer, are you all right?

117
00:08:25,410 --> 00:08:27,510
Yes, I'm fine.

118
00:08:27,510 --> 00:08:30,000
I'm sorry. I was afraid we would get caught

119
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,250
so using my wits, I did some acting here.

120
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:38,690
Yes.  I  compliment you on your fast response.

121
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,000
You're also very strong.

122
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:59,690
Even if an actor's job looks very glamorous on the surface,

123
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,890
I think it's a very difficult job.

124
00:09:01,890 --> 00:09:05,580
You have to accept even cruel comments as your fate.

125
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:13,400
Even so, I've had more joy in the work.

126
00:09:13,400 --> 00:09:17,240
When I receive an interesting script, it makes my heart flutter

127
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,610
and if I see a filming site humming with activity, I feel so alive.

128
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:25,910
If there is a good response to a show that I've worked hard on, I feel a sense of accomplishment.

129
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:29,610
I have many more of those happy memories.

130
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:36,280
Especially the piece which was called Signal. That one stands out the most in my memory.

131
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:40,600
I think it was because it played a challenging character  which drew out of me

132
00:09:40,600 --> 00:09:44,830
a new image which was latent within me and never seen before.

133
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:49,460
But I liked everything I worked on.

134
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:54,320
However, you wouldn't understand because you haven't watched any of my dramas.

135
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:56,120
Yes.

136
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:00,160
I'll answer the call.

137
00:10:01,080 --> 00:10:03,140
Yes, it's Kwon Jeong Rok.

138
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:05,430
Yes, I am out for a while now but

139
00:10:05,430 --> 00:10:08,950
I will send you my advisory opinion as soon as I get back to the law firm.

140
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:12,410
Yes.  Of course. Yes.

141
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:17,580
Do you have to return to the law firm?

142
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:18,710
Yes.

143
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:22,440
Then, why are you leaving work?

144
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:25,670
So that I can take you home.

145
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:32,050
Really? You don't have to.

146
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:36,610
This must be why people date.

147
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:40,100
I love that there is someone who is concerned about me

148
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:42,590
and takes care of me like this.

149
00:11:04,250 --> 00:11:07,890
 Especially there is the piece called Signal. 

150
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:10,010
 That one stands out the most in my memory. 

151
00:11:10,010 --> 00:11:13,630
 However, you wouldn't understand because you haven't watched any of my dramas. 

152
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,200
 Signal 

153
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,990
A woman takes a job as an insurance salesperson at Signal Life Insurance company.

154
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:30,730
After many twists and turns, she becomes the queen of insurance sales.

155
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:34,110
A life-changing office drama.

156
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,530
"Signal" 
 Detective Lee? 

157
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:43,790
 What in the world happened in 1997? 

158
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:46,430
 I know it. 

159
00:11:46,430 --> 00:11:49,750
 You had an appendectomy, right? 

160
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:54,500
 But you didn't have the insurance to cover your medical problems. 

161
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:57,340
 Your life doesn't end at the age of 60. 

162
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:01,590
 The future can be changed. 

163
00:12:01,590 --> 00:12:04,570
 Don't ever give up! 

164
00:12:12,110 --> 00:12:15,170
 How could you meet someone else? 

165
00:12:15,170 --> 00:12:17,770
 With one heart, 

166
00:12:17,770 --> 00:12:20,630
 how could you love two people? 

167
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:28,020
♫  You don't have to smile anymore  ♫

168
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:35,460
♫  Wher your eyes and lips  ♫

169
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,680
♫  Are saying something different to me  ♫

170
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,000
  One sip that fills me softly and deeply  
♫  How can I be holding on to you?  ♫

171
00:12:49,710 --> 00:12:53,670
♫  Your pillow  ♫

172
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:57,030
♫  That was always soaked  ♫

173
00:12:57,030 --> 00:13:02,580
♫  Will dry out now  ♫

174
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:06,230
♫  To the extent you and I struggled  ♫

175
00:13:06,230 --> 00:13:08,230
I miss her.

176
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:14,740
♫  we fought hard  ♫

177
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:19,880
♫  Even being angry, we did a lot  ♫

178
00:13:19,900 --> 00:13:26,700
♫  We don't have to care anymore about the early morning  ♫

179
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:32,410
♫  Now it's a comfortable Good Night  ♫

180
00:13:32,410 --> 00:13:35,350
You look more surprised than I expected.

181
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:39,430
I came here without notice to surprise you.

182
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:42,220
How come you're here at this time?

183
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:45,080
Tada. I came by for a friendly visit

184
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:47,500
so you can have some late night snacks while you work.

185
00:13:47,500 --> 00:13:50,740
This is the time when people start to feel hungry

186
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:55,030
and I was wondering if you're working well without me.

187
00:13:55,030 --> 00:13:59,150
And... I missed you.

188
00:14:24,410 --> 00:14:28,980
Anyway, what were you concentrating so much on?

189
00:14:28,980 --> 00:14:31,530
I saw the drama you were in.

190
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:32,880
You looked great acting the scene.

191
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:36,440
Right? Don't I have my own unique style?

192
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:39,340
It's not at the level of  "goddess of acting" or "crazy-good acting,"

193
00:14:39,340 --> 00:14:42,050
but it's not bad enough to be criticized so strongly, right?

194
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:47,630
Yes, you don't need to be depressed by bad comments from now on. It's not true.

195
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,520
That's what I'm saying. From now on, if you see those bad comments,

196
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,310
press "not recommend."

197
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:56,020
Yes, I will.

198
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:02,690
Why are you looking at me like that?

199
00:15:04,210 --> 00:15:06,430
To become this confident,

200
00:15:06,430 --> 00:15:09,430
I wonder how many times you got hurt.

201
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:14,440
I'm sure you had a hard time  all of that time.

202
00:15:15,590 --> 00:15:18,580
You did a great job overcoming them.

203
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:45,510
- Ms. Yoon Seo, Mr. Kwon is not here yet, right? 
 - Yes.

204
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:48,040
Come eat lunch with us.

205
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,840
That is ...

206
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:53,890
I'll just wait and eat with him.

207
00:15:53,890 --> 00:15:56,160
I'm sure he will come soon.

208
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:00,430
He may think I'm petty if I eat alone now.

209
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,470
No problem. Have a great lunch, then.

210
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:05,470
Okay. You too, Ms. Yang.

211
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:14,540
I wonder when Mr. Lawyer will be back.

212
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:20,720
It's so nice to have dumplings for the first time in a long while.

213
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:27,210
CEO! Why would you splash the broth like that?

214
00:16:27,210 --> 00:16:32,470
From now on, let's try to avoid having this kind of hot pots.

215
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,560
Just for the sake of having some dumpling soup,

216
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,900
if I get a burn on this handsome face,

217
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:40,630
that would be penny wise and pound foolish, would it not?

218
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:43,350
Penny wise and pound foolish, my butt.

219
00:16:43,350 --> 00:16:47,570
- Lawyer Dan, are you going to stand by and watch? Say something.
 - What?

220
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,730
Me?

221
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:51,110
Yeah. You loathe Lawyer Choi.

222
00:16:51,110 --> 00:16:54,910
So don't hold back and give him all the criticism you want.

223
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:01,390
When did I... loathe him?

224
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:10,150
You should stop eating dumplings.

225
00:17:10,150 --> 00:17:13,400
There's total of eight dumplings, so it's two per person,

226
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:16,000
but you've already had your share.

227
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:19,440
Why are you being so cheap with some dumplings? We can order another.

228
00:17:19,440 --> 00:17:24,910
Should I order some more? But it'll take some time to cook them.

229
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:27,540
We can't really wait, right?

230
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:29,890
Then you can give up your share. Yours.

231
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:33,180
I can't. I love this restaurant's dumplings.

232
00:17:33,180 --> 00:17:38,110
I... will never give up my dumplings to you.

233
00:17:38,110 --> 00:17:41,260
It's too precious for that.

234
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:43,520
  I could never give up this woman to the likes of you. 

235
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:46,340
 She's too precious for that. 

236
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,330
Ah, this is expensive.

237
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,400
♫  Olé!  ♫

238
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,520
You startled me.

239
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:09,750
What's the matter, Lawyer Dan?

240
00:18:09,750 --> 00:18:15,700
I know. Why are you caressing one side of your face like this and...

241
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:25,060
It's a toothache, isn't it?

242
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:28,200
Your molar has a cavity, right? Let's see. Say ah.

243
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:30,950
If it hurts, don't just put up with it and go see a dentist.

244
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,390
It's nothing like that.

245
00:18:32,390 --> 00:18:35,710
What do you mean? The way you're holding it, it's a toothache.

246
00:18:35,710 --> 00:18:40,180
You already don't give off a happy impression. If you look miserable, the clients will be uncomfortable.

247
00:18:40,180 --> 00:18:42,700
If it hurts, go to a dentist.

248
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:47,100
It's not a toothache, I said.

249
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:02,850
I guess you like salad.

250
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:09,230
Bulgogi in a stone bowl. Black bean noodles.

251
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,420
Stir-fried kimchi and rice.

252
00:19:15,740 --> 00:19:17,510
Pizza.

253
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,650
They're all yummy..

254
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:25,910
What's wrong with him? Lunchtime is almost over.

255
00:19:25,910 --> 00:19:28,410
When is he coming back?

256
00:19:28,870 --> 00:19:31,690
 Lawyer-nim Kwon Jeong Rok 

257
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:35,540
Yes, Mr. Lawyer? When are you coming...? What?

258
00:19:37,030 --> 00:19:38,570
You're going to be late, you said?

259
00:19:38,570 --> 00:19:41,410
That's because the discussion went on longer than planned.

260
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:43,370
I'll just eat something here,

261
00:19:43,370 --> 00:19:46,830
so make sure you have a good lunch.

262
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:52,600
Okay. Then, I'll see you later. Yes.

263
00:20:00,930 --> 00:20:05,530
I should have gone with Secretary Yang and had lunch, then.

264
00:20:05,530 --> 00:20:06,620
Ah, that was good.

265
00:20:06,620 --> 00:20:09,620
- Man.
 - Don't you think the stew was kind of salty today?

266
00:20:09,620 --> 00:20:13,950
Really? I mixed two bowls of rice in it. I thought it was delicious.

267
00:20:13,950 --> 00:20:16,060
You ate two bowls  because  the soup was salty.

268
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:18,350
Because you were cutting the saltiness with rice.

269
00:20:18,350 --> 00:20:21,490
Then I should've had some water. How could I mix rice in it?

270
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:30,140
 They say that dandelion tea is good for the stomach. Drink this instead of coffee. 

271
00:20:30,140 --> 00:20:32,620
 By the way, when are you going to pay back your debt? 

272
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,600
Among the items seized there was no smoking gun which directly substantiates the charge.

273
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:05,000
In this case, I'm afraid the request for an extension of detention for Jang Ji Ho will be rejected.

274
00:21:06,130 --> 00:21:08,910
When Jang Ji Ho was caught gambling abroad and brought in,

275
00:21:08,910 --> 00:21:12,210
the company would have already made their move on this side.

276
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:15,140
It's not like I didn't predict this would happen.

277
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,970
Lawyer Choi Yoon Soo has always been very familiar with that place.

278
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:20,870
Do you know Lawyer Choi Yoon Soo well?

279
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:24,020
I did know him.

280
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,210
He was my senior in the special department.

281
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:30,370
At the time he was the best prosecutor for economic crimes.

282
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:35,400
and now he is the lead lawyer for the chaebols on the opposite side of the street.

283
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,990
Anyway, good work. I'll take care of the rest.

284
00:21:38,990 --> 00:21:40,480
Alright.

285
00:21:43,620 --> 00:21:46,730
 What about one evening next week? I'll pay my debt back. 

286
00:21:46,730 --> 00:21:49,150
What is it that you're smiling like that? Who is it?

287
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:51,090
- Yeo Reum.
 - What?

288
00:21:52,090 --> 00:21:53,750
Now that we're talking about it, let's get this sorted.

289
00:21:53,750 --> 00:21:56,430
I still have feelings for Yoo Yeo Reum,

290
00:21:56,430 --> 00:22:00,330
so I don't view anyone as a woman but her.

291
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:04,170
So don't cross the line anymore.

292
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:08,620
I don't want to lose a competent and skilled junior. Okay?

293
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:19,350
Mr. Lawyer, here are the documents you requested.

294
00:22:19,350 --> 00:22:21,050
Alright.

295
00:22:21,670 --> 00:22:24,740
- It's time to get off work. Let's go home now.
 - Okay.

296
00:22:26,860 --> 00:22:32,120
Well, that is... I didn't eat lunch.

297
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:34,830
Why didn't you eat lunch?

298
00:22:34,830 --> 00:22:38,310
Why do you think? I was waiting so that I could go with you

299
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:41,530
but you suddenly called me and said that you were eating out.

300
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:44,840
So I just skipped it.

301
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:46,760
Then you should just eat alone.

302
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:50,840
You know that I can't eat alone.

303
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:54,590
Why in the world can't you eat lunch alone?

304
00:22:54,590 --> 00:23:00,760
Mr. Lawyer, you must have forgotten this because I'm beside you and you see me every day,

305
00:23:00,760 --> 00:23:03,470
but I was a celebrity.

306
00:23:03,470 --> 00:23:06,660
If I go around alone, something bad could happen.

307
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:11,670
And I was a top star who didn't have the freedom to eat alone.

308
00:23:11,670 --> 00:23:14,450
But it's not like that now, right?

309
00:23:14,450 --> 00:23:19,920
Seriously. Of course that's true, but...

310
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:24,490
Since I'd be trying something that I've never done before, I don't have the confidence to do it.

311
00:23:25,210 --> 00:23:31,080
If I'm alone, I look miserable and pitiful. Anyway, it's hard for me.

312
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:35,020
Then, you must be very hungry. Let's go eat first.

313
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:40,840
That's a good idea. I'll get ready to clock out.

314
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:59,950
Is this the place you are recommending? Is this a famous restaurant?

315
00:23:59,950 --> 00:24:03,320
It's not a famous restaurant. It's a one-person restaurant.

316
00:24:03,320 --> 00:24:04,700
A one-person restaurant?

317
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,860
Yes, it's like a study room, so it's separated with dividers.

318
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:11,260
You can't tell who is sitting next to you or what that person is eating.

319
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,930
It is the perfect place to introduce you to eating alone.

320
00:24:12,930 --> 00:24:16,130
Wait... Wait a minute.

321
00:24:16,130 --> 00:24:18,130
What do you mean by eating alone?

322
00:24:18,130 --> 00:24:21,810
Wait. We came together, so why do we need to eat alone?

323
00:24:21,810 --> 00:24:26,230
You have to practice beforehand so that you can eat alone well even when I'm not with you.

324
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:30,790
Ah... But, I hate eating alone.

325
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:34,890
If you can't eat alone, there's nothing you can do alone.

326
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:38,280
I will help you, so let's practice little by little.

327
00:24:54,950 --> 00:24:58,090
Why are you sitting so far?

328
00:24:58,790 --> 00:25:02,350
As if it were real, pretend that you came here to eat alone.

329
00:25:26,970 --> 00:25:31,350
 Mr. Lawyer, do you want a fried dumpling? 

330
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:39,140
 Pretend that you are really eating alone and concentrate on eating. 

331
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:50,270
 To be honest, it's so awkward that I don't even know where to put my eyes. 

332
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:53,320
 If we message each other while eating, it might make me feel better. 

333
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,460
 This will only lengthen your mealtime. 

334
00:25:56,460 --> 00:26:00,840
 So, let's talk later and concentrate for now on eating. 

335
00:26:16,930 --> 00:26:19,990
♫  Yes, for me everything is new  ♫

336
00:26:19,990 --> 00:26:22,750
♫  What will it be feeling like? You know, right?  ♫

337
00:26:22,750 --> 00:26:25,870
♫  Anything hip and elegant  ♫

338
00:26:25,870 --> 00:26:28,440
♫  Well... That's complicated  ♫

339
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:31,230
♫  Even if I'm acting as though I don't know, I'm pretending  ♫

340
00:26:31,230 --> 00:26:33,670
♫  Be careful not to be intimidated  ♫

341
00:26:33,670 --> 00:26:36,840
♫  Yes, I am Thunder giving off flashes  ♫

342
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,600
♫  Expect me to be loud  ♫

343
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,730
♫  (Say) Hi lovely  ♫

344
00:26:41,730 --> 00:26:44,050
But, Mr. Lawyer... 
 ♫  We're beautiful  ♫

345
00:26:45,250 --> 00:26:48,490
I definitely told you to concentrate on eating. 
 ♫  It's hard  ♫

346
00:26:48,490 --> 00:26:50,490
It's not that. 
 ♫  Try saying it more simply  ♫

347
00:26:50,490 --> 00:26:54,040
I want you to take a proof picture of me eating alone.

348
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:58,220
It's a meaningful event to me, so I want to remember it.

349
00:26:58,220 --> 00:26:59,690
♫  Perhaps a very heart pounding new day  ♫

350
00:26:59,690 --> 00:27:02,790
Since you're going to do it, make it a paparazzi style of picture.

351
00:27:02,790 --> 00:27:04,740
♫  Don't act like you don't know  ♫

352
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:07,740
♫  You're going to fall for me  ♫

353
00:27:07,740 --> 00:27:10,720
♫  Hurry now and show yourself to me  ♫

354
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,180
♫  Ya, what you gonna do?  ♫

355
00:27:12,180 --> 00:27:14,870
♫  What you gonna do? Woo hoo  ♫

356
00:27:17,390 --> 00:27:19,820
♫  What you gonna do? Woo hoo  ♫ 
 ♫  Say hey  ♫

357
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,610
♫  Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on now  ♫

358
00:27:22,610 --> 00:27:25,320
♫  What you gonna do?  ♫ 
 ♫  What you gonna do?  ♫

359
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:30,950
Office Manager, you are getting off work late.

360
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:35,260
I had some work piled up. Secretary Yang, why are you here?

361
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:37,770
I went to drink tea with an acquaintance.

362
00:27:37,770 --> 00:27:40,210
Ah, yes.

363
00:27:54,820 --> 00:28:00,850
 She seems very tired. The first time I saw her, she was snoozing like this, too. 

364
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,690
 I'm sorry. I'm sorry. 

365
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:16,220
 He is our Office Manager, Lee Doo Seob, who will be working with us from today onwards. 

366
00:28:16,220 --> 00:28:19,620
 He was a detective, so he will be a great help to us. 

367
00:28:20,250 --> 00:28:22,770
 Secretary Yang, you should clock out. 

368
00:28:22,770 --> 00:28:26,230
 I'll go after I organize this. 

369
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,320
 Yes, Teacher? 

370
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,120
 Secretary Yang looks really tired. 

371
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:34,270
 Once she gets home, she'll have to look after her child all by herself. It'll be hard on her. 

372
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,850
 She has a child? 

373
00:28:36,850 --> 00:28:38,500
 Isn't she cute? 

374
00:28:39,830 --> 00:28:43,930
 Her instructor sent me this picture. She's so cute. 

375
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,260
 Yes, she's cute. 

376
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:48,960
 I thought her smile was so pretty. 

377
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:52,540
 That's why I hoped she continued to smile. 

378
00:28:52,540 --> 00:28:55,100
 To her who is living a tiring life, 

379
00:28:55,100 --> 00:28:59,510
 I wished that only things that would make her smile would continue to occur. 

380
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:04,100
 It was probably then that I started to like— 

381
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:05,520
 Oh? 

382
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:12,020
Secretary Yang.

383
00:29:13,290 --> 00:29:16,070
Secretary Yang. We have arrived.

384
00:29:16,070 --> 00:29:19,970
My gosh! Already? I'm always thankful. See you tomorrow, Office Manager.

385
00:29:19,970 --> 00:29:22,240
- Yes, get home safely. 
 - Yes.

386
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,810
It's dark. What are you doing here with the lights turned off?

387
00:29:42,810 --> 00:29:46,240
Oh? Nothing.

388
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:48,520
Give me food. I'm hungry.

389
00:29:56,330 --> 00:29:58,700
Thank you for taking me home.

390
00:29:58,700 --> 00:30:02,760
You get worried about the hate comments I receive.

391
00:30:02,760 --> 00:30:06,880
You even taught me how to eat by myself. You get...

392
00:30:07,890 --> 00:30:10,900
99 points as a boyfriend.

393
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:18,470
But why was I docked one point?

394
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,610
Because of your way of expressing yourself.

395
00:30:22,610 --> 00:30:27,270
If you could fix your businesslike way of talking, then you would've gotten 100.

396
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:32,130
Can you talk to me more comfortably with affection?

397
00:30:32,130 --> 00:30:37,880
When you call me, don't say "Oh Jim Sim."

398
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:44,300
Call me "Jim Sim-sshi". No, "Jim Sim-ah"! 
  (T/N: -sshi is formal, and -ah is casual") 

399
00:30:44,300 --> 00:30:46,090
Ah, what's with that?

400
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:47,320
Why?

401
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:51,760
It would be good if you could talk comfortably like you do with Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum and Prosecutor Kim Se Won.

402
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:55,120
It naturally became like that because we've known each other for a long time.

403
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:59,000
If I suddenly change my way of talking, wouldn't it be awkward for me?

404
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,520
"Wouldn't it be awkward for me?"

405
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:05,300
Are you mocking me right now?

406
00:31:05,300 --> 00:31:08,300
"Are you mocking me right now?"

407
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:12,820
See? Now that I say it like that, it sounds really stiff, doesn't it?

408
00:31:12,820 --> 00:31:14,190
Isn't it scary?

409
00:31:14,190 --> 00:31:16,830
No. It's cute.

410
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:22,360
It will be difficult for me to change my way of talking suddenly.

411
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:24,460
And, if I suddenly change my way of talking,

412
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:28,400
people in the office will start to suspect our relationship.

413
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:32,520
For your sake, it's better to be careful.

414
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:35,700
Yes, that's true.

415
00:31:36,820 --> 00:31:40,360
By the way, I'm curious about something.

416
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:45,620
There's only a month before you leave the law firm. What do you plan to do afterward?

417
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,560
Pardon?

418
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:51,630
Seeing how you studied law, that means that you were interested in this field.

419
00:31:51,630 --> 00:31:54,020
Are you planning to continue in this field in the future?

420
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:57,600
Oh, I...

421
00:32:00,130 --> 00:32:03,470
OPPA! What—

422
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,680
Leave, leave! Hey!

423
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,630
Oppa! What are you doing here?

424
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,910
I told you that I would go home by myself. Why did you come?

425
00:32:13,910 --> 00:32:16,480
I came to give you side dishes.

426
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:19,230
But— Mr. Lawyer.

427
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:25,590
Why are you bringing her home today?

428
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:27,160
What is wrong with this Oppa this time?

429
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:31,500
No, you know that I mean. What if paparazzi takes pictures of you two alone?

430
00:32:31,500 --> 00:32:34,930
What are you saying? You know that paparazzi stopped following me a long time ago!

431
00:32:34,930 --> 00:32:37,930
Hurry and go in! Hurry!

432
00:32:37,930 --> 00:32:40,450
Mr. Lawyer, get home safely.

433
00:32:41,240 --> 00:32:42,780
Go!

434
00:32:47,970 --> 00:32:51,740
My gosh, where did he go? What is wrong with you, seriously?

435
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:57,950
Come here.

436
00:32:57,950 --> 00:33:01,360
Her cousin is taking care of her excessively.

437
00:33:08,150 --> 00:33:12,550
I seriously can't tell what your relationship is like with that lawyer.

438
00:33:12,550 --> 00:33:17,280
Some days, you seem to like him. Some other days, you seem to hate him.

439
00:33:17,280 --> 00:33:20,430
Today, you looked like best friends. You looked extremely close.

440
00:33:20,430 --> 00:33:23,930
We are close. We have a lot of affection for each other.

441
00:33:26,500 --> 00:33:30,890
- Oppa, about this project...
  - This project?

442
00:33:30,930 --> 00:33:35,390
The fact that I went to the law firm to get real life experience for Writer Lee Sae Jin's drama.

443
00:33:35,390 --> 00:33:38,860
- Yes, yes. 
 - About this...

444
00:33:38,860 --> 00:33:41,790
Can I tell a little to Mr. Lawyer?

445
00:33:41,790 --> 00:33:44,030
Why? Why would you do that?

446
00:33:44,030 --> 00:33:48,930
Nothing. It's just been bothering me that I continue to lie to Mr. Lawyer.

447
00:33:48,930 --> 00:33:52,450
I see him every day. It's pricking my conscience.

448
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:56,730
Of course, I promised to the writer and to the CEO to keep this a secret.

449
00:33:56,730 --> 00:34:00,670
But, Mr. Lawyer is someone that can keep a secret.

450
00:34:00,670 --> 00:34:05,500
So, I would like to tell him a little about it.

451
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,800
Oppa, Mr. Lawyer is a really trustworthy person.

452
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:13,150
If I told him about it, then he'll understand my situation.

453
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:17,190
Yoon Seo, I know that it's bothering you.

454
00:34:17,190 --> 00:34:19,590
But the main point of this project is that it's secret.

455
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:22,360
You said you wanted to receive attention from Writer Lee Sae Jin's drama.

456
00:34:22,360 --> 00:34:26,030
Until an official article is released, your casting must remain a secret.

457
00:34:26,030 --> 00:34:29,830
That was the first condition. We must keep that promise.

458
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:33,470
I'm afraid if Mr. Lawyer finds out later, he'll be disappointed.

459
00:34:33,470 --> 00:34:37,370
You'll leave the law firm and never see him again anyway, so what's the big deal?

460
00:34:37,370 --> 00:34:41,030
Yoon Seo, instead of worrying about that lawyer getting disappointed,

461
00:34:41,030 --> 00:34:46,550
can't you worry about this Oppa and our CEO who will be disappointed if this project falls apart?

462
00:34:53,710 --> 00:34:56,840
If I tell him, then I'll be in trouble.

463
00:34:57,580 --> 00:35:00,850
If I don't tell him, then it bothers me.

464
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:04,550
Will he feel betrayed when he finds out later

465
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:07,450
because I wasn't honest with him?

466
00:35:18,610 --> 00:35:21,130
Ah, a squid.

467
00:35:21,130 --> 00:35:24,100
You're late.

468
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:27,840
Did you come home from a date with the universe's goddess?

469
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:30,600
Stop it before I send you flying out of the universe.

470
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:34,030
- Do you want to drink beer? With some dried squid? 
 - Forget it.

471
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:58,620
Since she wants it so much, just once.

472
00:36:00,570 --> 00:36:04,600
Jin Sim-sshi. Jin Sim-ah.

473
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,830
Jin Sim-ah, did you get home safely?

474
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:10,200
Jin Sim-ah. Jin Sim-ah. Jin Sim-ah.

475
00:36:10,200 --> 00:36:13,170
Jin Sim-ah, you are really pretty.

476
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:15,430
That is so dry.

477
00:36:17,240 --> 00:36:19,150
It looks delicious.

478
00:36:22,090 --> 00:36:26,180
J-Jin Sim-ah. Jin Sim-ah. Jin Sim-ah.

479
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:31,340
- Jin Sim-ah. 
 - This is honestly baffling. 
  (T/N: Jin Sim means honest) 

480
00:36:32,650 --> 00:36:37,340
You were together all day long and you're lovingly calling her name at home.

481
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:39,520
It's love. It's love.

482
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:42,370
Why didn't you knock? Come over here for a moment.

483
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:46,780
Why? Are you going to show me a picture of your beloved girlfriend, the universe's goddess?

484
00:36:46,780 --> 00:36:50,030
No, I'm showing you another house for you to live in.

485
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:52,400
 An Apartment in an Instant 

486
00:36:53,390 --> 00:36:56,290
This apartment is quite nice and you can also move in immediately.

487
00:36:56,290 --> 00:36:58,470
Immediately?

488
00:36:58,470 --> 00:37:00,910
Immediately is a bit extreme, my friend.

489
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:02,720
Look at the interior, too.

490
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:05,540
This is the left side.

491
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:08,220
I can see it well, but I'll slowly

492
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,130
I'll slowly look into it. Finish up your practice.

493
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:21,830
Jin Sim-ah, do you want to eat lunch?

494
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:29,970
- My gosh, this is too much. 
 - I know.

495
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:32,630
What are you looking at?

496
00:37:32,630 --> 00:37:35,540
This is a video that was uploaded on a community page I check often.

497
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:39,680
Someone anonymously filmed and uploaded a video of middle school students bullying another.

498
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:42,570
- Do you want to watch it? 
 - Yes.

499
00:37:43,450 --> 00:37:46,820
 Keep your promise. You better keep your promise next time. 

500
00:37:46,820 --> 00:37:50,390
- Kids these days are extreme, aren't they? 
 - They are.

501
00:37:50,390 --> 00:37:55,290
What do you mean?  My Jin Yi is at the police station?

502
00:37:58,090 --> 00:37:59,290
 Sangdo Police Station 

503
00:37:59,290 --> 00:38:02,310
 Keep your promise. You better keep your promise next time. 

504
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:03,800
Wait a minute.

505
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:07,070
Are you saying that this is  my Jin Yi?

506
00:38:07,070 --> 00:38:11,280
Mom, it's not me. It's really not me.

507
00:38:12,330 --> 00:38:15,460
Seo Jin Yi keeps claiming that.

508
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:17,940
However, the students who bullied with her in the video,

509
00:38:17,940 --> 00:38:22,860
nicknamed the " School Bullies"  and the victim Park Min Joo,

510
00:38:22,860 --> 00:38:25,230
all claim that Seo Jin Yi is the perpetrator.

511
00:38:25,230 --> 00:38:28,330
It's not a claim! It's the truth!

512
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:34,500
All this time, she mischievously took my daughter's money and her will to live.

513
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:38,410
My whole world has fallen apart.

514
00:38:38,410 --> 00:38:41,330
She didn't take her money once or twice.

515
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,890
Where did you spend all that money?

516
00:38:43,890 --> 00:38:46,130
It's really not me. It's the truth!

517
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:49,240
What do you mean it's not you?! How dare you try to fool people?

518
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:52,240
- This kid is not ordinary. 
 - Excuse me, Min Joo's mother.

519
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,910
I understand that you're upset. However, we haven't clearly verified the situation yet.

520
00:38:55,910 --> 00:38:57,500
Please refrain from using harsh words.

521
00:38:57,500 --> 00:39:01,000
What do you mean it's not verified? There's the kids' testimony..

522
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:03,350
And there's even concrete evidence!

523
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:07,250
The evidence you are talking about in this video doesn't even properly capture the face of the child,

524
00:39:07,250 --> 00:39:09,500
so you cannot say that it is my daughter.

525
00:39:09,500 --> 00:39:12,100
Furthermore, Jin Yi doesn't have this padded coat.

526
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:15,840
- Still! 
 - And the concrete evidence that I believe it is not my daughter is that

527
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:18,050
Jin Yi is not that kind of child.

528
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:23,360
She is not a child who would cruelly bully her friends.

529
00:39:24,260 --> 00:39:26,980
Listen to me Seo Jin Yi's mother.

530
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,010
All parents of problematic children say that.

531
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:33,810
"Our child is not like that."

532
00:39:33,810 --> 00:39:37,940
But your daughter is like that! She is cruel and rude!

533
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,350
I have clearly explained to you.

534
00:39:41,350 --> 00:39:44,120
I told you to refrain from using harsh words.

535
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:48,630
Investigator, if you find any problems, please follow through with the official procedure.

536
00:39:48,630 --> 00:39:50,200
Let's go.

537
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:53,440
You! I'm going to sue you!

538
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:56,430
I said I'm going to sue you!

539
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:05,370
Don't worry. I will take care of it.

540
00:40:05,370 --> 00:40:08,330
Thank you, Mom, for believing me.

541
00:40:08,330 --> 00:40:13,170
What are you thankful for? It's given that a mom should trust her daughter.

542
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,700
You'll be late for cram school. Hurry up and go.

543
00:40:19,700 --> 00:40:23,430
If you're hungry, buy something to eat.

544
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:27,880
Alright. I'll be back, Mom.

545
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,960
Be careful.

546
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:44,500
I see.

547
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:46,650
Don't worry, Secretary Yang.

548
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:50,280
We are full of lawyers here. There's nothing to worry about.

549
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:54,940
Tell me more in detail tomorrow. Don't worry.

550
00:40:57,860 --> 00:41:00,760
Did something happen to Secretary Yang?

551
00:41:01,800 --> 00:41:07,160
Secretary Yang's daughter Jin  Yi was identified as the perpetrator of school violence.

552
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:11,150
It seems that she was falsely accused. Can you help her?

553
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:12,810
Of course, I should.

554
00:41:12,810 --> 00:41:16,400
Really? That's surprising.

555
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:18,880
What do you mean surprising? How do you see me?

556
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:22,370
A prickly person. With skills.

557
00:41:23,210 --> 00:41:29,790
Then, take care of this case. Jin Yi is Secretary Yang's only family.

558
00:41:36,900 --> 00:41:41,040
I'm speechless. What do you see my daughter as?

559
00:41:54,600 --> 00:41:57,670
If she wore it, she should hang it.

560
00:41:57,670 --> 00:42:02,040
Aigoo, what is this?

561
00:42:18,260 --> 00:42:21,130
Why isn't she answering the phone?

562
00:42:21,910 --> 00:42:23,300
It's not that.

563
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,760
Are you really going to be like this?

564
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:32,690
Jin Yi, I didn't do it on purpose.

565
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:49,810
Secretary Yang, stop frowning.

566
00:42:49,810 --> 00:42:53,970
Our Ace, Lawyer Kwon said that he was going to take care of your case. There's nothing to worry about.

567
00:42:53,970 --> 00:42:56,900
That's right, don't worry too much.

568
00:42:56,900 --> 00:42:58,830
It will be solved properly.

569
00:42:58,830 --> 00:43:03,330
From what I heard, Jin Yi has been falsely accused.

570
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:08,720
I don't think it was false.

571
00:43:13,180 --> 00:43:18,560
I think I raised my child wrong.

572
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,430
She was bullying her friends.

573
00:43:45,380 --> 00:43:50,020
I asked her where her padded coat came from.

574
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:54,700
But she didn't say a word. I think that

575
00:43:55,220 --> 00:43:58,720
she bought it from the money she took from her friends.

576
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:05,760
I was always sorry

577
00:44:05,760 --> 00:44:09,200
that I couldn't give her a complete family.

578
00:44:09,200 --> 00:44:12,900
However, I raised her loving her more than anything.

579
00:44:14,970 --> 00:44:20,960
I don't know about anything else, but I thought I raised her as a nice child.

580
00:44:23,300 --> 00:44:27,930
What should I do?

581
00:44:31,210 --> 00:44:33,640
Secretary Yang.

582
00:44:56,050 --> 00:44:59,010
What should we do?

583
00:44:59,010 --> 00:45:02,410
Secretary Yang raised her so lovingly and preciously.

584
00:45:03,990 --> 00:45:07,990
Is it certain that the child wearing the white padded coat is Jin Yi?

585
00:45:07,990 --> 00:45:11,870
Circumstantial evidence and Secretary Yang say so.

586
00:45:11,870 --> 00:45:15,270
Jin Yi is standing by the fact she did not do it.

587
00:45:15,270 --> 00:45:19,950
In these types of situations, parents usually lose their sense of objectivity

588
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:22,820
since they have no choice, but to be emotionally involved.

589
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:25,730
At those times, we should concentrate even more on the facts.

590
00:45:25,730 --> 00:45:29,500
That is correct. We cannot verify the face of the perpetrator.

591
00:45:29,500 --> 00:45:33,080
And Jin Yi claimed that she is truly not the perpetrator.

592
00:45:33,080 --> 00:45:35,790
Since we are given this case,

593
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:39,510
it is better to not think of our client as guilty or anything of the sort.

594
00:45:39,510 --> 00:45:45,370
Then, as you said, we will stand in Jin Yi's perspective and listen to her side of the story.

595
00:45:50,930 --> 00:45:54,030
Can I go with Oh Yoon Seo?

596
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,540
Yes, go ahead.

597
00:46:00,860 --> 00:46:04,250
I heard a lot about you from Secretary Yang.

598
00:46:04,250 --> 00:46:08,310
I wanted to meet you at least once. It's nice to meet you.

599
00:46:09,400 --> 00:46:11,250
It's not me.

600
00:46:11,250 --> 00:46:13,910
I really didn't do it.

601
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:18,850
I know. We believe you.

602
00:46:21,090 --> 00:46:25,810
So, could you tell us the truth?

603
00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:32,050
The victim said that you were the one who bullied her.

604
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,760
Why did she do that?

605
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,350
Do you think that she ordinarily has bad feelings toward you?

606
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:38,910
I didn't even know her.

607
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:44,120
Then, what about the perpetrator? Were they also students who you didn't know who tried to shift the blame to you?

608
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:53,780
Then can you tell us what happened with the padded coat?

609
00:46:53,780 --> 00:46:56,580
I think your mother doesn't recognize that clothing.

610
00:46:58,110 --> 00:47:01,000
I'm sorry, but I'll leave now.

611
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:04,950
My own mother doesn't even believe me, so what else should I say?

612
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:10,240
Jin Yi!

613
00:47:11,560 --> 00:47:13,570
She's the one in the video, isn't she?

614
00:47:13,610 --> 00:47:17,640
- She didn't seem like the type.
 - Look at her. What's wrong with her, seriously?

615
00:47:22,630 --> 00:47:24,410
Excuse me.

616
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:29,180
Why are you following me? I told you, I don't have anything else to say.

617
00:47:29,180 --> 00:47:34,780
Ah. Excuse me but, does student Jin Yi,

618
00:47:34,780 --> 00:47:37,640
perhaps  like stir-fried rice cakes?

619
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:38,750
What?

620
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:46,560
What happened?

621
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:50,980
Jin Yi wouldn't open up till the end.

622
00:47:50,980 --> 00:47:55,880
But no matter how I look at it, Jin Yi doesn't seem like the type of kid to do something bad like that.

623
00:47:55,940 --> 00:47:59,130
It's possible that she may be being threatened.

624
00:47:59,170 --> 00:48:02,880
Threatened? By whom?

625
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,860
No way... By the real perpetrator?

626
00:48:07,500 --> 00:48:12,940
So, even if she feels wronged, she's not doing anything because she's scared, right?

627
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:17,130
Usually, there are two cases where the person doesn't identify the perpetrator, even if they know who it is.

628
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:23,330
Either they were threatened by the perpetrator, or they want to protect the perpetrator.

629
00:48:23,330 --> 00:48:26,530
In Jin Yi's case, I think it's the latter.

630
00:48:29,400 --> 00:48:31,920
When I reviewed the victim's parents' statements,

631
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:35,080
they said she continually was involved in incidents of school bullying.

632
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:37,450
- So it really happened repeatedly.
 - Wait a moment.

633
00:48:37,450 --> 00:48:41,100
The CCTV confirmed each time Jin Yi and the student victim crossed paths.

634
00:48:41,100 --> 00:48:45,870
Yes. That's the girl that fought with my Jin Yi in front of the school before.

635
00:48:45,870 --> 00:48:48,590
I thought that Jin Yi was bullying that girl.

636
00:48:53,190 --> 00:48:55,170
Excuse me.

637
00:48:55,170 --> 00:48:56,630
What is it, Ahjumma?

638
00:48:56,630 --> 00:48:58,760
I'm Seo Jin Yi's mom.

639
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:02,840
Can we talk for a moment?

640
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:08,160
I found out that the perpetrator, Park Seong Yeong, has been close friends with Jin Yi since they were young children.

641
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:13,240
But from some point on, hanging out with the school bullies, she went on the wrong path.

642
00:49:13,240 --> 00:49:16,940
She borrowed Jin Yi's coat and wore it as she assaulted the victim.

643
00:49:16,940 --> 00:49:19,460
And then that video ended up spreading on the internet,

644
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:24,390
so the perpetrator got scared of being punished and framed Jin Yi since she was the owner of the coat.

645
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:27,980
Then the reason why Jin Yi isn't telling the truth is...

646
00:49:27,980 --> 00:49:31,950
Because she was her friend from when they were young and she still treasures her,

647
00:49:31,950 --> 00:49:34,570
I think that she was waiting until she confesses herself.

648
00:49:36,010 --> 00:49:39,380
Since the true perpetrator confessed, the police will wrap it up through private arbitration.

649
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:42,550
They will officially charge the real perpetrator and resolve the case.

650
00:49:42,550 --> 00:49:44,730
That's a relief.

651
00:49:59,330 --> 00:50:02,360
Do you have something to say to me?

652
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:10,060
I promised Jin Yi that I would keep this a secret,

653
00:50:10,060 --> 00:50:12,430
but I feel like you need to know.

654
00:50:12,470 --> 00:50:17,970
Jin Yi said that she's actually met up with her father a few times.

655
00:50:19,770 --> 00:50:22,480
 I want to meet Dad now. 

656
00:50:25,120 --> 00:50:30,010
I don't want to lie to Mom and meet up with you. I don't think that's right.

657
00:50:30,010 --> 00:50:33,600
Her father is also the one who gave her the coat.

658
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:37,560
Really? Wait, but why didn't she tell me?

659
00:50:37,560 --> 00:50:41,110
Ah, that. She said that she was worried that you'd be hurt,

660
00:50:41,110 --> 00:50:43,400
so she couldn't tell you the truth.

661
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,760
Because she couldn't tell you that she was meeting with her father

662
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:51,850
or that her close friend had framed her,

663
00:50:51,850 --> 00:50:54,870
I think that Jin Yi was going through a really hard time.

664
00:51:04,250 --> 00:51:06,190
Did you meet with your dad?

665
00:51:06,190 --> 00:51:07,580
Hm?

666
00:51:07,580 --> 00:51:11,750
I saw you with your dad while I was passing by.

667
00:51:11,790 --> 00:51:13,610
That...

668
00:51:16,990 --> 00:51:20,030
I'm sorry, Mom.

669
00:51:20,070 --> 00:51:23,120
What are you sorry for?

670
00:51:25,640 --> 00:51:30,010
Dad hurt you.

671
00:51:30,010 --> 00:51:32,770
You probably hate him.

672
00:51:33,970 --> 00:51:36,970
I'm sorry for meeting with him secretly.

673
00:51:38,790 --> 00:51:43,460
No. I feel sorrier.

674
00:51:43,460 --> 00:51:47,150
You must have needed your dad,

675
00:51:47,150 --> 00:51:51,240
but I didn't even realize how you felt

676
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:55,440
and made your heart suffer. I'm sorry.

677
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:59,490
♫  Starry light, light dii light  ♫

678
00:51:59,490 --> 00:52:01,860
And...

679
00:52:01,860 --> 00:52:05,930
Because I didn't believe in you until the end,

680
00:52:05,930 --> 00:52:08,080
I'm sorry.

681
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:11,030
I'm sorry, my daughter.

682
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:17,490
♫  Oh starry light liedi light  ♫

683
00:52:17,490 --> 00:52:23,020
♫  Starry light light dii light  ♫

684
00:52:23,020 --> 00:52:27,300
♫  Starry light light di light  ♫

685
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:32,130
♫  Starry light liedi light  ♫

686
00:52:32,130 --> 00:52:34,980
Thank you.

687
00:52:34,990 --> 00:52:36,790
Thank you.

688
00:52:36,790 --> 00:52:39,640
Goodness, this is cute. Why did you bring something like this?

689
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:42,300
You worked really hard because of me.

690
00:52:42,300 --> 00:52:44,180
It's because I'm thankful and feel sorry.

691
00:52:44,180 --> 00:52:46,120
What do you mean, you're sorry?

692
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:49,660
We always get a lot of help from your mom here at the law firm.

693
00:52:49,700 --> 00:52:51,850
Compared to what your mom has done for us,

694
00:52:51,850 --> 00:52:55,530
this doesn't amount to even the smallest fraction. So don't even think about feeling sorry.

695
00:52:55,530 --> 00:52:56,200
Yes, sir.

696
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,190
And make sure that you don't do anything to upset your mother from now on.

697
00:53:00,190 --> 00:53:03,200
You know that your mother treasures you very greatly, right?

698
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:06,510
I know that very well, too.

699
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,470
She's so cute.

700
00:53:12,470 --> 00:53:14,490
There's nothing going on at the company with Yoon Seo, right?

701
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:16,660
There's no trouble with that Kwon Jeong Rok or whatever his name is, right?

702
00:53:16,660 --> 00:53:20,160
Yes, recently she's doing very well and nothing bad is happening.

703
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:22,960
How did our Yoon Seo end up meeting such a horrible boss?

704
00:53:22,960 --> 00:53:25,700
Hey, do you know what the most stressful thing is in a person's work life?

705
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:28,540
It's stress from bosses. Stress from bosses.

706
00:53:28,580 --> 00:53:31,010
They should just let things be. They just take things that aren't that big of a deal

707
00:53:31,010 --> 00:53:33,920
and go on and on nagging at the workers under them.

708
00:53:33,920 --> 00:53:36,120
Goodness, I hate it. That's so annoying.

709
00:53:36,120 --> 00:53:39,730
It really is annoying. I agree with the above, Mr. CEO.

710
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,970
Hey, but is that the only shirt you have?

711
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:47,570
You wore that the day before yesterday, didn't you?

712
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:51,040
Did I? As expected, your eye for things is amazing, CEO.

713
00:53:51,040 --> 00:53:54,940
You're the one who is amazing.  You will take a shirt worth 30,000 won  and wear it for 30,000 years.

714
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:59,280
Is the shirt your skin or something? You should think of the company's image, too. Go and buy something different to wear.

715
00:53:59,280 --> 00:54:00,900
Yes, sir.

716
00:54:05,410 --> 00:54:07,180
Oh, this is hot.

717
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:11,210
What's with you gargling the coffee?

718
00:54:11,210 --> 00:54:16,660
Gargle, gargle, gargle. I hate it when people make noises while they eat.

719
00:54:16,660 --> 00:54:18,820
- Don't do that.
 - Yes, sir.

720
00:54:20,330 --> 00:54:22,310
Why? Are you displeased?

721
00:54:22,310 --> 00:54:24,030
No.

722
00:54:28,380 --> 00:54:31,310
Ah, ow. That's hot.

723
00:54:33,350 --> 00:54:36,070
Excuse me, Mr. CEO. A present came for Oh Yoon Seo.

724
00:54:36,070 --> 00:54:39,150
Ah, really? Leave it there, please.

725
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:42,990
Thanks.

726
00:54:42,990 --> 00:54:45,960
Wow, it's been a really long time since our Yoon Seo got a present.

727
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:48,780
So she still had such a loyal fan.

728
00:54:56,650 --> 00:55:01,290
Hey. Hey, isn't this the plant that guy would send sometimes?

729
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,040
Yes.

730
00:55:03,070 --> 00:55:08,180
That... Where did they say Lee Gang Joon is right now?

731
00:55:08,180 --> 00:55:12,120
I understand he is staying in the US.

732
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,600
In contrast to the depressed Steel side, Imperial Bio is impressive.

733
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:37,270
We're targeting a 30% increase in sales in the second half of the year.

734
00:55:42,500 --> 00:55:45,040
She's living well.

735
00:56:00,190 --> 00:56:03,060
Why are you looking at me like that?

736
00:56:03,060 --> 00:56:05,090
Because you're cool.

737
00:56:05,950 --> 00:56:08,820
What? What are you saying all of a sudden?

738
00:56:08,860 --> 00:56:13,010
Mr. Lawyer, every time I see you solving a case like this,

739
00:56:13,010 --> 00:56:16,450
I really admire you.

740
00:56:16,450 --> 00:56:21,340
I think that working as a lawyer is a really cool job.

741
00:56:22,300 --> 00:56:27,250
I didn't go to law school because I was actually interested in this field of work.

742
00:56:28,220 --> 00:56:30,980
I actually debuted when I was in high school,

743
00:56:30,980 --> 00:56:33,950
and at that time my dad really opposed it.

744
00:56:33,950 --> 00:56:39,580
He was worried that his precious daughter would get hurt in that rough field of work.

745
00:56:39,620 --> 00:56:42,760
But because I stubbornly insisted that I would do it,

746
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,830
he told me I had to go to law school. He said that he would give me permission if I went to law school.

747
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:52,650
You know when they say things like, "Not over my dead body!" Things like that.

748
00:56:53,570 --> 00:56:56,050
It was something impossible like that.

749
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:59,070
It's not like I crazily studied well in school or anything,

750
00:56:59,070 --> 00:57:05,180
but I studied like crazy then and made it into law school.

751
00:57:05,250 --> 00:57:09,090
I told you this before, but I'm really good at memorization.

752
00:57:09,090 --> 00:57:13,450
Goodness. But after I made it into law school,

753
00:57:13,490 --> 00:57:18,180
I found that it didn't match my aptitude. So I quit after one semester.

754
00:57:19,810 --> 00:57:23,980
If I had known it was such a cool line of work back then, I would have studied hard back then.

755
00:57:23,980 --> 00:57:26,140
I'm regretting it.

756
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:29,890
It's not too late, even now.

757
00:57:29,890 --> 00:57:33,990
If you say that you want to study for this job, I'll help you.

758
00:57:33,990 --> 00:57:37,600
Didn't you come to the law firm because you wanted to experience this type of work, anyway?

759
00:57:39,800 --> 00:57:41,590
What?

760
00:57:43,180 --> 00:57:44,620
Lawyer Kwon.

761
00:57:44,620 --> 00:57:45,920
Yes?

762
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:50,490
After you finish working, do you want to go out and have a drink with Yoon Seo and me?

763
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:52,940
What?

764
00:57:52,940 --> 00:57:57,890
It's because I'm really grateful to you for solving the incident with Secretary Yang without being paid for it.

765
00:57:57,890 --> 00:58:00,240
I even made a reservation to drop some major cash.

766
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:02,880
But the office manager said that he can't make it today.

767
00:58:02,920 --> 00:58:06,400
I'm saying that the three of us should go out to have a drink, even though it's disappointing.

768
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:07,580
Deal?

769
00:58:09,130 --> 00:58:11,540
Yoon Seo, deal?

770
00:58:11,540 --> 00:58:12,750
Ah, deal!

771
00:58:12,750 --> 00:58:15,830
Deal! I'll see you later!

772
00:58:15,830 --> 00:58:19,430
Wait, should I not have said I was going?

773
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,760
Actually, I'm not feeling that great today.

774
00:58:22,760 --> 00:58:25,750
Then I'll drink for you.

775
00:58:25,750 --> 00:58:27,960
You will?

776
00:58:27,960 --> 00:58:30,040
Are you good at drinking alcohol?

777
00:58:30,040 --> 00:58:32,660
Hm. Rather than saying I have a high tolerance for alcohol,

778
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:35,830
I hate looking too relaxed and disheveled in front of other people.

779
00:58:35,830 --> 00:58:40,930
So I keep my guard up at all times and pay close attention so that I won't drink over my limit.

780
00:58:40,930 --> 00:58:45,020
One can say that my self-control is complete to the point of death.

781
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:52,630
I have never been drunk even once up until now.

782
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:58,550
Mr. CEO.

783
00:59:06,250 --> 00:59:07,780
Do you know Hobbes?

784
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:09,970
- Corpse?
 - Yes, Hobbes.

785
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:12,050
I'm talking about the philosopher Hobbes.

786
00:59:12,050 --> 00:59:16,220
He stated, "The condition of man is a condition of war of everyone against everyone."

787
00:59:16,220 --> 00:59:20,810
That's what he said. I can't agree with that statement.

788
00:59:20,810 --> 00:59:25,320
Especially the assertion that self-interest can be limited for the sake of public interest.

789
00:59:25,320 --> 00:59:30,740
Lawyer Kwon. I'm confused as to whether this is a pub or a debate hall right now.

790
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,890
Shall we stop talking about the law?

791
00:59:32,890 --> 00:59:35,190
Yes, yes. Sorry.

792
00:59:35,190 --> 00:59:40,000
- Then, then let's talk about Weon Ja Haeng.
 - Weon Ja...?

793
00:59:40,070 --> 00:59:42,180
Yes, Weon Ja Haeng sounds good. Weon Ja Haeng.

794
00:59:42,180 --> 00:59:44,550
Who is Weon Ja Haeng? Your ex-girlfriend?

795
00:59:44,550 --> 00:59:47,800
Her name seems rather unique. Right?

796
00:59:47,830 --> 00:59:51,100
 Actio Libera in Causa. ( The criminal law doctrine involving defendants who “create the conditions of their own defense.”)  

797
00:59:51,100 --> 00:59:54,470
Doing as one pleases.  Article 10 Clause 3 of the Criminal Law.

798
00:59:54,470 --> 01:00:00,850
If one puts himself accidentally or intentionally  n a psychological or physical condition

799
01:00:00,850 --> 01:00:04,060
which predisposes him to cause an accident or commit a crime,

800
01:00:04,060 --> 01:00:08,540
then is it right for this act to be punished or not?

801
01:00:08,580 --> 01:00:12,010
CEO, what do you think?

802
01:00:12,010 --> 01:00:17,220
How is it that even when you're drunk you're still boring and serious, Lawyer Kwon?

803
01:00:18,550 --> 01:00:22,740
Is Mr. Lawyer always like this when he gets drunk?

804
01:00:22,740 --> 01:00:25,190
I think this is the first time I've seen him get drunk.

805
01:00:25,190 --> 01:00:27,990
Lawyer Kwon, why did you drink so much today?

806
01:00:27,990 --> 01:00:35,360
Ah, yes. Because I was drinking in Oh Jin Sim's stead, I drank a lot.

807
01:00:35,430 --> 01:00:39,770
Because Oh Jin Sim said that she wasn't feeling well today.

808
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:42,580
Why is Lawyer Kwon drinking in your stead because you're not feeling well?

809
01:00:42,580 --> 01:00:47,120
The heartless Lawyer Kwon who doesn't even acknowledge blood or tears is drinking in your stead.

810
01:00:49,970 --> 01:00:54,750
That's... It must be because he's worried that if I'm not in good condition,

811
01:00:54,750 --> 01:00:59,720
I won't be able to work tomorrow.

812
01:00:59,720 --> 01:01:02,180
That's why I'm saying this.

813
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,050
I...

814
01:01:07,960 --> 01:01:11,910
will go to the bathroom. The bathroom.

815
01:01:18,010 --> 01:01:20,160
- Hobbes.
 - Hobbes?

816
01:01:20,160 --> 01:01:22,930
- Actio Libera in Causa.
 - Actio Libera in Causa!

817
01:01:29,400 --> 01:01:34,030
I thought that he was only rough toward you, but he actually takes care of you quite well.

818
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:36,230
Ah. Yes.

819
01:01:36,230 --> 01:01:40,480
When you said that Lawyer Kwon teaches you a lot and is very considerate of you before,

820
01:01:40,480 --> 01:01:44,070
I actually didn't believe you. I thought there was no way.

821
01:01:44,070 --> 01:01:48,700
But with that personality, he's drinking alcohol in your stead anyhow.

822
01:01:48,740 --> 01:01:51,980
When I look at him closely, he seems to be taking care of you in little ways.

823
01:01:51,980 --> 01:01:55,790
It seems like you two have built up a good relationship.

824
01:01:55,790 --> 01:01:56,910
Yes, well.

825
01:01:56,910 --> 01:02:02,120
When you quit, Lawyer Kwon may actually be upset.

826
01:02:03,250 --> 01:02:07,380
Right. Are your preparations for the drama going well?

827
01:02:08,640 --> 01:02:14,760
- Yes.
 - When I first heard that you thought you would be taking on a lawyer's role in a drama

828
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:19,070
and so wanted to work at our company for three months,

829
01:02:19,110 --> 01:02:23,640
I thought my heart was going to burst out of my chest because it was fluttering so much.

830
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:28,480
But we're parting from each other as soon as we meet. You've only got one month left.

831
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,780
I don't know why time is flying by so fast.

832
01:02:30,780 --> 01:02:34,450
Because I've remained like an iron barrel, I've kept this secret closely guarded,

833
01:02:34,450 --> 01:02:39,960
but when you return to the entertainment field and show up in a drama as a lawyer later,

834
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:43,290
don't you think the people at the our law firm will be so surprised?

835
01:02:43,330 --> 01:02:48,720
I think even Lawyer Kwon, who doesn't even blink an eye at anything else that happens, will be really surprised. Right?

836
01:03:01,800 --> 01:03:04,040
 Yoon Seo, thank you. 

837
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:06,890
 I think everything was resolved well thanks to you. 

838
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:09,040
 I didn't even do anything. 

839
01:03:09,040 --> 01:03:12,830
 Anyway, I'm really glad that the misunderstanding was resolved. 

840
01:03:21,030 --> 01:03:26,900
 Yes. We've used this incident as an opportunity to promise that we wouldn't have secrets in our relationship. 

841
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,750
 We felt that it was really bad to have secrets 

842
01:03:29,750 --> 01:03:33,150
 in what is supposed to be your closest relationship. 

843
01:03:47,180 --> 01:03:49,130
Are you alright, Mr. Lawyer?

844
01:03:49,130 --> 01:03:50,310
Yes.

845
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:51,670
Drink some water.

846
01:03:51,670 --> 01:03:54,500
Ah, thank you.

847
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:00,130
Thank you.

848
01:04:00,130 --> 01:04:03,920
Wait, but how are you so serious even after getting that drunk?

849
01:04:03,920 --> 01:04:07,130
The way you talk didn't change either.

850
01:04:07,170 --> 01:04:08,870
Am I like that?

851
01:04:08,870 --> 01:04:11,200
"Am I like that?"

852
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,560
But still, I've gotten to see you drunk.

853
01:04:16,560 --> 01:04:20,070
Since I saw a new side of you, I'm happy.

854
01:04:20,070 --> 01:04:22,500
I'm also happy

855
01:04:22,500 --> 01:04:27,770
because it feels like I'm gradually learning new sides of you these days.

856
01:04:28,710 --> 01:04:32,680
I'm finding out about the difficult times you've been through

857
01:04:32,680 --> 01:04:36,810
and your cute and pretty sides of you as you were acting.

858
01:04:37,810 --> 01:04:43,900
I like that I'm learning things about you one by one like that.

859
01:04:43,940 --> 01:04:46,220
But

860
01:04:47,850 --> 01:04:54,520
I haven't told you everything.

861
01:04:54,520 --> 01:04:58,940
There's something I still haven't been able to tell you yet.

862
01:04:58,940 --> 01:05:01,340
That's...

863
01:05:02,580 --> 01:05:06,480
I didn't hide it purposely, but...

864
01:05:08,270 --> 01:05:11,220
So, what I'm saying is...

865
01:05:15,200 --> 01:05:18,080
Never mind.

866
01:05:18,090 --> 01:05:21,650
It's cold. Shall we head inside?

867
01:05:27,850 --> 01:05:29,850
Let's go.

868
01:05:35,030 --> 01:05:39,090
It's okay even if you don't tell me.

869
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:47,870
I'm perfectly fine with you having something to hide.

870
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:52,380
If that's what's best for you,

871
01:05:52,380 --> 01:05:57,370
then you can do it a hundred and a thousand times over.

 ~ Preview ~ 

893
01:07:56,470 --> 01:07:59,450
 It's thrilling and so romantic. 

894
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:03,680
 Aigo, those are the good old days. You get to express your affection without other people knowing. 

895
01:08:03,680 --> 01:08:05,590
- Did you get something in your eye? 
- Yes.

896
01:08:05,590 --> 01:08:10,150
 I must be crazy. Why do I keep falling for him? Oh my god! 

897
01:08:10,170 --> 01:08:11,860
 What do I mean, oh my god? 

898
01:08:11,860 --> 01:08:13,800
 Is this why people get married? 

899
01:08:13,850 --> 01:08:14,920
 Come hang out at my house. 

900
01:08:14,920 --> 01:08:16,930
 That means I'm going to Oh Jin Sim's house. 

901
01:08:16,930 --> 01:08:18,380
 She might be thinking I have other intentions. 

902
01:08:18,380 --> 01:08:21,480
 This is the first time that a boyfriend is coming into my place. 

903
01:08:21,480 --> 01:08:24,260
 I wanted to spend our remaining time well so that we don't waste it. 

904
01:08:24,300 --> 01:08:26,650
 Since we only have one month left. 

905
01:08:26,650 --> 01:08:29,140
  I don't want to provoke him. 

906
01:08:29,140 --> 01:08:30,550
 I know. 

907
01:08:30,550 --> 01:08:33,240
 I know. I know that he's someone who made you suffer. 

908
01:08:33,280 --> 01:08:34,980
 I heard that Lee Gang Joon is back. 

909
01:08:34,980 --> 01:08:37,000
 There's nothing wrong with Yoon Seo, right?
