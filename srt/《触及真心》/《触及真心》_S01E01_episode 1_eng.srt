1
00:00:03,700 --> 00:00:06,500


2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,300
 She's gone, Yoon Seo Oh! 

3
00:00:08,300 --> 00:00:10,490
 Actress Oh Yoon Seo, her current status? 

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:35,500
 Touch Your Heart 

5
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:40,900
 Touch Your Heart 

6
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:49,410
♫   Oh, the dark clouds are filling the sky overhead  ♫

7
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,880
♫   And we know that we'll live and we'll die without dread  ♫

00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,000
♫  And our children will live by their light  ♫

00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:39,030
♫  Fight like tomorrow's  never gone  ♫

18
00:01:56,510 --> 00:01:58,680
Yeon Seo, how do you feel?

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,430
Do you admit to being a drug user?

20
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:02,590
What's your relationship with the son of the Jeguk ( Imperial ) Group?

21
00:02:02,590 --> 00:02:04,250
Do you still claim you are innocent?

22
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:07,480
- Please make a comment. 
 - How do you feel right now?

23
00:02:13,250 --> 00:02:15,350
  On Air  
  2 Years Later 

24
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:18,370
In this corner, it's that time for an update on a has-been star.

25
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:20,150
  Episode 1  
Oh my.  Who is  the star?

26
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:22,960
Today's main star, who was immensely popular in South Korea, of course,

27
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,500
as well as throughout Asia for her innocent image, is Oh Yoon Seo.

28
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,440
Oh my god, I was totally curious about Oh Yoon Seo! How is she, do you know?

29
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:34,100
What I've heard from rumors is that

30
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:37,390
she's staying home and currently awaiting her next movie.

31
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:38,260
I see.

32
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,690
But could an actress who was involved in a drug scandal return to the screen? No.

33
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:46,250
First of all,  didn't the drug test result show negative

34
00:02:46,250 --> 00:02:48,540
and didn't the court rule that she was innocent?

35
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,820
So there is a possibility for her return, but her image is completely tarnished.

36
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:55,490
The most important thing is, she's already forgotten.

37
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:05,380
Yoon Seo, don't! Don't!

38
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,550
Don't do that! What are you doing now?!

39
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,850
Why are you like this?

40
00:03:09,850 --> 00:03:12,960
This isn't the answer, no matter how hard it is!

41
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,660
Of course, I wouldn't know how much you are hurting.

42
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,670
You got swept up in that rubbish scandal and your image plummeted.

43
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:22,010
You insisted on paying the contract termination fee and became broke, and dozens of anti-cafes popped up.

44
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:25,290
So what if the misunderstanding is cleared up? Your life is still in shambles!

45
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:27,300
Do you have friends to chat with or a boyfriend to rely on?

46
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,150
Every day you hang out, eat, live, sleep alone. How is a boyfriend going to come find you?

47
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:33,830
But, Yoon Seo, this isn't the way.

48
00:03:33,830 --> 00:03:37,620
This is too extreme a method.  It's not, Yoon Seo.

49
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,290
My vitamins!

50
00:03:41,290 --> 00:03:43,210
Vitamins?

51
00:03:43,210 --> 00:03:45,150
Seriously, why?!

52
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:46,710
What vitamins are these?

53
00:03:46,710 --> 00:03:48,430
 Multi Vita 

54
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,630
They're vitamins?

55
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:52,200
Yep.

56
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:55,980
Why were you taking so many?

57
00:03:55,980 --> 00:04:00,030
It says here to take 30 pills.

58
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:05,480
Yoon Seo, you bright little thing, it says that there are 30 pills total in the bottle.

59
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,350
Here, it says to eat one a day.

60
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,580
Ah, I thought so, I almost threw up.

61
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,470
Is that so.

62
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,630
But, why are you here?

63
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:31,550
Oh right. The profile picture that we took last week.

64
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:33,200
Why are you so pretty in it?

65
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:36,860
I picked out a few because you're so pretty.

66
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,210
What's the point of having a profile?

67
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:44,850
No work is coming in.

68
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:50,470
Oppa, can I really come back?

69
00:04:50,470 --> 00:04:53,600
Of course, just wait a little longer.

70
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,990
You'll definitely appear in a blockbuster drama as—

71
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,440
The main female lead's maternal aunt.

72
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,870
Do you know what my age is?

73
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:04,100
Is the number important? What's important is how your old your face looks.

74
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:08,190
Honestly, if you were a little shorter, I'd even pick you for a child role.

75
00:05:08,190 --> 00:05:10,450
You look younger than you are.

76
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:14,790
A child role is a bit much.

77
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:16,900
Oh?

78
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,460
I definitely put it in between these in case it got creased.

79
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:21,790
 Love is a Painful Law 

80
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,080
What's with this drama script?

81
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,920
This is the surprise!

82
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,930
The profile pictures selection was an excuse.

83
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:37,360
You came to give me a script!

84
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,040
No, I mean, that's not it.

85
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:42,220
Who's the writer? What's the story?

86
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:44,670
You don't need to know.

87
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,490
Don't need to know?

88
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:53,310
Then I guess it's not mine.

89
00:05:54,550 --> 00:05:56,180
Yoon Seo,

90
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:00,240
If not, then it's not. Why hide it?

91
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:05,310
What hide? I'm not hiding it!

92
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,120
Whatever. I'm not interested in things like that.

93
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:11,270
Hey, Yoon Seo! Wait!

94
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:15,560
Why are you so petty? Hey, Yoon Seo!

95
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,980
Wow!
  Script: Lee Sae Jin 
Direction: Kim Nam Jun 

96
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:23,770
Wow! It's Writer Lee Sae Jin's script.

97
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:26,760
Love is a Painful Law

98
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:34,320
 A company lawyer specializing in mergers and acquisitions goes to the Middle East on vacation 

99
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:38,640
 and falls in a love with a judge advocate (  military lawyer )." 

100
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,740
It's already fun.

101
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:14,120
You dropped this.

102
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:18,940
Thank you, I really hate making mistakes—

103
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:22,780
 I also can't stand people who make mistakes but the person who made this mistake looks adorable. 

104
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:24,740
"This is a first. Ho ho ho."

105
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:27,720
I can't stand it!

106
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:32,920
While I'm being terrified as the heroine who is held captive by a terrorist group,

107
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:36,150
the hero then appears.

108
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,260
 Jeong Do 

109
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:40,140
 I'm sorry. 

110
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:42,880
 because  of me you were forced to suffer this dangerous experience. 

111
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:45,690
"Why did you come, why? What am I supposed to do?"

112
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:50,120
"They say you could lose your life doing that."

113
00:09:54,490 --> 00:10:01,160
 That you would lose your life rather than me losing mine terrified me more. 

114
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:34,100
Soo Ah!

115
00:10:34,930 --> 00:10:41,310
Sorry I have to say these words now.

116
00:10:41,310 --> 00:10:44,380
I love you.

117
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:48,670
Soo Ah!

118
00:10:59,420 --> 00:11:01,350
This is it.

119
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:04,860
Oppa, I have goosebumps.

120
00:11:04,860 --> 00:11:06,320
Goosebumps?

121
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,260
This script's heroine is totally me.

122
00:11:11,260 --> 00:11:14,740
Aren't I totally in sync with this role?

123
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,010
Why? Which part?

124
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,850
See. The heroine is known to have innocent-looking features.

125
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:23,140
I'm so innocent.

126
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:27,300
Moreover, she's a lawyer.

127
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:29,270
I graduated from law school.

128
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:32,300
Anyway, not this one. This is Min Ji's.

129
00:11:33,380 --> 00:11:34,950
It's Kim Min Ji's?

130
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:37,430
It's not. No, it's not.

131
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:39,120
Anyway, Min Ji isn't going to do this either. This.

132
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:42,550
Why? A drama written by Lee Se Jin is something.

133
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:47,670
That's not what I'm talking about.  This is set 80% of the time in foreign locales.

134
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:50,350
Both Min Ji and whoever have been out of the country for months.

135
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,970
So the cast is falling over one right after the other and the production costs are have gone through the roof.

136
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:56,290
There isn't a single investor.

137
00:11:56,290 --> 00:12:00,960
The way I see it, as things go, this is an absolute flop.

138
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:06,720
So then it has to be me, right?

139
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,850
Why do you think like that?

140
00:12:10,850 --> 00:12:14,490
I have tons of free time. I can be on-site at a foreign location full time.

141
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:20,750
On top of that, the production costs have gone through the roof, but if I give a big discount, wouldn't that be good?

142
00:12:20,750 --> 00:12:24,450
Leave it to me. I'll ask Writer Lee Se Jin personally.

143
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:28,260
In the past, I worked with her so we are pretty close.

144
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:31,510
Yoon Seo!

145
00:12:31,510 --> 00:12:34,190
Wait. Hold on!

146
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:40,750
Hello? Writer?

147
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:43,400
It's me, Yoon Seo.

148
00:12:46,010 --> 00:12:51,420
Yoon Seo, I understand what you're trying to say. I really do.

149
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:55,580
But honestly, working with you is a bit burdensome.

150
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:59,400
You should have had a normal scandal.

151
00:12:59,400 --> 00:13:03,480
Oh, Ms. Writer, you have to know that's not true!

152
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,920
Whether it's true or not isn't important.

153
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:09,570
The viewers are saying that they don't want to see your face anymore.

154
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:14,830
And to put it bluntly, it's not like you're an amazing actress either.

155
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:21,990
Ms. Writer, I may not be so good at acting so that I cause goosebumps,

156
00:13:21,990 --> 00:13:25,150
but you know that my viewership ratings were amazing, right?

157
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:29,850
I don't know about anything else, but I'm confident that I can make headlines.

158
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:34,030
You did make headlines. Because of your bad acting.

159
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,290
Ms. Writer, please, believe me just this once.

160
00:13:40,290 --> 00:13:44,980
Ah, I really want to do this one.

161
00:13:47,110 --> 00:13:48,760
Oppa.

162
00:13:48,820 --> 00:13:52,700
Ms. Writer, please give us just one opportunity.

163
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:56,730
Yes.  We'll make her thoroughly rehearse her acting.

164
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:09,770
I have one condition.

165
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:12,250
A condition?

166
00:14:12,250 --> 00:14:14,790
I can't do that! Not ever!

167
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,470
She's telling me to go to a law office and get some real-life experience.

168
00:14:18,470 --> 00:14:20,660
Does this make sense?

169
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,300
It's believable.

170
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:26,150
Yoon Seo, I had an interview with an English actor, right?

171
00:14:26,150 --> 00:14:28,110
But then as soon as he got the role of a student studying for a big exam,

172
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:30,170
he went to live in the student study dorm district.

173
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:34,470
He said that he would study those students' way of speaking, clothing styles, and even their habits to enact them.

174
00:14:34,470 --> 00:14:37,790
So Yoon Seo, you should also just think of it as studying acting and...

175
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:39,720
Studying acting?

176
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:43,200
Oppa, I'm Oh Yoon Seo.

177
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:47,420
Oh Yoon Seo, the actress who's had fifteen years since her debut.

178
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:50,900
- Isn't that right, CEO? 
 - Yes, that's right. You're Oh Yoon Seo.

179
00:14:50,900 --> 00:14:52,920
Spending two years in self-reflection when I was innocent is not fair.

180
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:58,590
I'm not going to compromise and get in this way rather than making a splendid comeback.

181
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,730
- Isn't that right, CEO? 
- Yes, that's right.

182
00:15:02,630 --> 00:15:06,180
To be honest, did I make it this far because I was a good actress?

183
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,160
I made it this far all because I'm pretty.

184
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:12,000
Why is she suddenly wanting me to act out of nowhere?! Isn't that right, CEO?

185
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,930
Ah, you're famous for your bad acting...

186
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,310
What did you say?

187
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:24,840
Ah, no... That's not it. What I meant was,

188
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:30,380
we can't work with that Writer Lee Se Jin! How dare she tell our Yoon Seo to get some real-life practice.

189
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:32,830
Call her right away and tell her that we can't do it!

190
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:38,660
Really? Mr. CEO. This might be Yoon Seo's last chance in the world.

191
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:44,590
- My last chance?
 - So what if it's her last chance? She's saying that she's not going to study.

192
00:15:44,590 --> 00:15:47,140
But still, it took two years for her to get this job.

193
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:50,620
If she misses out on this drama, she may have to sit out for two more years!

194
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:53,670
- Two more years? 
  - Yes.  Good going. Just think of it like the Olympics.

195
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:55,340
You do it once every four years.

196
00:15:55,340 --> 00:15:58,400
She's saying she can't do it even if she were struck down dead, so what are we supposed to do then?

197
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,170
I—

198
00:16:00,990 --> 00:16:05,010
- When did I ever say I can't do it even if I were struck down dead? 
 - Never mind.

199
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,720
Call that Writer Lee Se Jin and curse her out and threaten her untli her ears bleed.

200
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,760
Say that we can't do that drama and then hang up on her!

201
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:14,690
Ah, yes.

202
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,580
Wait!

203
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:24,940
What? What is it?

204
00:16:24,940 --> 00:16:29,420
Well, one time... Iwanttotrytodoit.

205
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:32,420
What are you saying? Aren't you slurring your words?

206
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:37,350
I'm saying that I want to try that real-time practice once!

207
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:42,560
Hey, Yoon Seo. You're the Hallyu Goddess Oh Yoon Seo.

208
00:16:42,560 --> 00:16:45,280
You're Oh Yoon Seo, my goddess, your goddess, and the universe's goddess.

209
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,960
But you're going to be in a law office for three months?

210
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:51,880
Three months? How can you work for three months?

211
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,700
I can just do it. Why can't I?

212
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:56,780
Hey, this isn't something to think of as easy.

213
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:59,630
I'm not thinking of it as easy.

214
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:06,090
I know that it'll be hard for me to renew my contract if I lose this opportunity.

215
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:09,760
And I can't act badly forever.

216
00:17:11,320 --> 00:17:15,860
Fine.  If that's what you mean, I'll try to sell it. Okay. Fine.

217
00:17:16,690 --> 00:17:18,700
Wait, wait, wait!

218
00:17:18,700 --> 00:17:21,640
Hey, if you're going to ask and beg to back out of it, then you never should start.

219
00:17:21,640 --> 00:17:25,610
- Of course! I would never!
 - Okay!

220
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,060
 Law Firm CEO Yeon Joon Gyoo 

221
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:36,350
Work experience? Do you think that a law firm is some kind of act?

222
00:17:36,350 --> 00:17:39,660
This is a place which deals with sacred law.

223
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:43,040
If you're going to make such a lame request, then hang up right now. 
   Oh Yoon Seo will be going. 

224
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:46,960
I don't care if it's Oh Yoon Seo, Kim Yoon Seo, or Choi Yoon Seo. Tell her to start coming to work tomorrow, right now.

225
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,100
I'll stick her with the best lawyer there is, so do you understand what I'm saying?

226
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:55,090
I'm doing it because it's you. Don't thank me.

227
00:17:59,370 --> 00:18:05,230
I'm more thankful. It's my goddess, your goddess, and the universe's goddess Oh Yoon Seo.

228
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:08,660
Wow! Oh Yoon Seo is coming.

229
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:12,190
Did you hear? Oh Yoon Seo, at our...

230
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:15,890
Did you hear? Oh Yoon Seo is coming to work at our office starting tomorrow.

231
00:18:15,890 --> 00:18:20,670
Wow, awesome! Oh Yoon Seo! It's my Oh Yoon Seo. Oh.

232
00:18:24,830 --> 00:18:29,560
Hello. I am Always' CEO Yeon Joon Gyoo.

233
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,810
It's nice to meet you.

234
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:38,210
It's nice to meet you, Miss Yoon Seo.

235
00:18:38,210 --> 00:18:42,650
It's nice to meet you. It's nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, Miss Oh Yoon Seo.

236
00:18:42,650 --> 00:18:46,470
Why am I so awkward? It's awkward extending the same hand.

237
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:49,260
This isn't the time for me to be doing this.

238
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:51,680
Let's look for a lawyer.

239
00:18:53,930 --> 00:18:57,320
Hmm... Who should I match with our Yoon Seo?

240
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,130
A civil litigation specialist?

241
00:19:00,970 --> 00:19:05,320
- Then Dan Moon Hee?
 - I just borrowed it for a short while.

242
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:08,880
I'm telling you, I couldn't pay the money back because I don't have any money.

243
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:15,200
Yes, but you own a building in Gangnam, right?

244
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,340
It costs so much to raise children. Why wouldn't I have one?

245
00:19:21,250 --> 00:19:23,990
Anyway, please take care of me.

246
00:19:23,990 --> 00:19:30,690
Yes, sir! I'll do my best to package your lack of conscience very prettily.

247
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:34,720
What? Are you telling me that I don't have a conscience right now?

248
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:36,560
- No! 
- She's timid.

249
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:39,340
- What are you doing? You just said something. 
  - She's too timid.

250
00:19:39,340 --> 00:19:42,630
- That lawyer won't be any help to our Yoon Seo.
 - Say it again.

251
00:19:42,630 --> 00:19:45,930
- It was nothing.
 - I told you to say it again!

252
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:54,690
Or how about the divorce specialist lawyer, Choi Yoon Hyeok?

253
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:58,460
Even if you're the one at fault for the divorce,

254
00:19:58,460 --> 00:20:03,220
you can still get enough of your husband's assets/property.

255
00:20:03,220 --> 00:20:05,760
Don't worry.

256
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:12,990
Here, take this.

257
00:20:15,500 --> 00:20:18,430
I will only believe in you, Mr. Lawyer.

258
00:20:18,430 --> 00:20:24,830
You marry in order to be happy, but you also divorce to be happy.

259
00:20:26,480 --> 00:20:30,100
Have you ever been married, Mr. Lawyer?

260
00:20:31,620 --> 00:20:34,060
There's no way.

261
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,970
Please, give me a moment.

262
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,420
Yes, Mother. What's the matter?

263
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:04,190
What do you mean, I'm acting unfamiliar? It's because I'm working, right?

264
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,990
The tonic? Of course I took it, Mom.

265
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:09,310
No way. No way. No.

266
00:21:09,310 --> 00:21:13,970
Ah, no way. I can't make our Oh Yoon Seo work under a mama's boy.

267
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:17,060
That's what I'm saying. Mama's boys are so tiring.

268
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:20,220
That's what I'm saying. Oh, you surprised me!

269
00:21:21,030 --> 00:21:23,610
- When did you get here?
 - Just now.

270
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:26,600
But, who is Yoon Seo?

271
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:28,520
What?

272
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:32,280
No, no one.

273
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:33,930
 Partner
 Kwon Jeong Rok 

274
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,600
Or maybe Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok.

275
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:44,460
While conceding the point made by the lawyer that the ETRI line is the nation's most authoritative,

276
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:47,200
regarding the prosecutor's claim that the information in question is a trade secret,

277
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:52,990
I would like to submit as evidence the analysis results indicating  the information is neither significant nor economically useful.

278
00:21:53,060 --> 00:21:54,860
 ETRI = Electronic Telecommunication Research Institute 

279
00:21:54,860 --> 00:22:01,740
As such, the information cannot be considered a trade secret. Thus, we request that you find the defendant 'not guilty'.

280
00:22:03,750 --> 00:22:08,930
In regards to the violation of the Unfair Competition Prevention Act and Trade Secret Protection Act,

281
00:22:08,930 --> 00:22:12,360
I announce the verdict of not guilty for the defendant.

282
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:18,420
Even though he's kind of particular, he is our office's ace. He's the top lawyer in this field.

283
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:21,180
You're going to go with Lawyer Kwon?

284
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:24,450
Shall I? Ah, you scared me!

285
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,540
So you decided on Lawyer Kwon in the end.

286
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:32,140
- What is it that you know?
 - I don't know anything.

287
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,440
- Do you have something to say to me?
 - You've been chosen. Congratulations!

288
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,970
What are you talking about?

289
00:23:04,970 --> 00:23:08,970
- So, why don't you want to? Why?
 - Do I really have to explain that to you?

290
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:12,380
Of course, you have to explain it for me to know. If you don't, how am I supposed to know?

291
00:23:12,380 --> 00:23:17,240
I'm saying that I'm going to provide you with a secretary. On top of that, the secretary is a Hallyu goddess. Why would you dislike this?

292
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:21,470
Is working at a law firm a joke? How can I trust and work with someone who's never worked in this field before?

293
00:23:21,470 --> 00:23:25,050
Miss Yoon Seo is actually from law school. You didn't know that, did you?

294
00:23:25,050 --> 00:23:29,280
Well, she only made it to the first semester of the first  year, but she's still from law school.

295
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:31,610
First semester of the first year, you said.

296
00:23:32,660 --> 00:23:35,470
Then she's just from a law school in words. She's not even at the level of taking baby steps.

297
00:23:35,470 --> 00:23:39,020
That's right. That's why I'm asking you to become her pacemaker car.

298
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:41,080
Then why should I—

299
00:23:43,180 --> 00:23:45,820
I don't think any further conversation is necessary, so I'm going to leave now.

300
00:23:45,820 --> 00:23:47,740
Jeong Rok!

301
00:23:48,490 --> 00:23:52,820
Lawyer Kwon, let's try to reconsider.

302
00:23:52,820 --> 00:23:57,720
Hey, I told you this, didn't I? My younger cousin is the CEO of Oh Yoon Seo's entertainment agency.

303
00:23:57,720 --> 00:23:59,720
He was begging me desperately.

304
00:23:59,720 --> 00:24:04,460
He asked me to use her as the secretary for no less, no more, just exactly three months.

305
00:24:10,970 --> 00:24:15,830
He groomed her as if she were his own child, but her life became a mess. How disappointed he must be!

306
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:18,920
He worked so hard and tried every method possible to salvage her career

307
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:22,340
before he ended up asking me in the end.

308
00:24:28,510 --> 00:24:30,860
Anyway, take Yoon Seo under your wing for just three months

309
00:24:30,860 --> 00:24:32,780
and teach her this profession.

310
00:24:32,780 --> 00:24:37,060
I know you're busy, but I'm asking because there's no one I can trust to do it except you.

311
00:24:37,060 --> 00:24:39,020
I don't want to.

312
00:24:41,960 --> 00:24:44,520
Well, it can't be helped if you insist.

313
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,570
Five years ago.

314
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:52,570
Ah, I don't know why I did that? I was being so nosy.

315
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:55,850
- CEO!
 - Huh?

316
00:24:55,850 --> 00:24:57,260
What?

317
00:24:57,260 --> 00:25:00,010
How long are you going to use that against me?

318
00:25:00,010 --> 00:25:01,880
Forever.

319
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:05,670
Until our Yoon Seo comes to work.

320
00:25:05,670 --> 00:25:08,860
Let's sit down and talk it out. I'm not asking you to do it for nothing.

321
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:11,280
I will double your incentives.

322
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,630
And finally, I'll help you.

323
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,640
Your first impression is important. You can't seem too celebrity-like

324
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,980
or look too much like an ordinary person.

325
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:32,140
You can't give off the feeling of a has-been celebrity.

326
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:34,500
A has-been celebrity?

327
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,110
A celebrity at her peak!

328
00:25:36,110 --> 00:25:39,680
I'm worried that you'll give off the feeling of a celebrity at the peak of her career.

329
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:41,390
That's pretty!

330
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:47,490
Yoon Seo, can you really do well on your own?

331
00:25:47,490 --> 00:25:50,120
Don't worry? Am I a little kid?

332
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:53,740
That's right. But I'm always worried.

333
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:57,540
And you heard what the CEO said earlier, right?

334
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:00,320
He said that he can't support me at all.

335
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:01,830
That's okay. I can do it on my own.

336
00:26:01,830 --> 00:26:04,430
What will you do on your own? You can't even withdraw your own money from the bank.

337
00:26:04,430 --> 00:26:07,970
Who goes to the bank these days? You do it through an app.

338
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:09,760
- You can't even drive. 
 - I have a driver's license though.

339
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,190
You can't even eat alone!

340
00:26:11,190 --> 00:26:13,020
How can I eat alone?!

341
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:16,310
And you worry too much, Oppa.

342
00:26:16,310 --> 00:26:20,470
Anyway, everyone will be standing in line to eat with me, so what are you worried about?

343
00:26:20,470 --> 00:26:22,260
- They will, right?
 - Yeah.

344
00:26:24,340 --> 00:26:26,390
I don't want to wear this.

345
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:51,320
- Morning!
 - You're here?

346
00:26:56,360 --> 00:26:58,730
What's with that overly flashy fashion?

347
00:26:58,730 --> 00:27:02,550
- Did you possibly go shopping because a celebrity is coming?
 - I had this at home.

348
00:27:02,550 --> 00:27:05,270
And what's with that flower bouquet?

349
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:07,100
It was at home.

350
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:16,120
A new family member is entering the company, so shouldn't I welcome her?

351
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:18,590
I didn't get any flowers when I first joined the company.

352
00:27:18,590 --> 00:27:19,970
Really?

353
00:27:19,970 --> 00:27:23,720
Anyway, I'm warning you again. It's a top secret that Oh Yoon Seo is working here.

354
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:26,510
And don't ever do anything that will make Oh Yoon Seo feel uncomfortable.

355
00:27:26,510 --> 00:27:29,990
For example, asking to take her picture or asking for her signature.

356
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:32,220
Don't get excited for nothing and overdo anything. Just act like normal.

357
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:36,030
Just act comfortably and normally, as usual. You get what I'm saying, right?

358
00:27:36,030 --> 00:27:38,980
I think you're the one who is the most excited and doing the most, CEO.

359
00:27:38,980 --> 00:27:40,290
- Really?
 - Oh?

360
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,370
They're here.

361
00:27:42,370 --> 00:27:44,080
- You're here?
 - Hi.

362
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:48,660
Hi, Lawyer Kwon! When Yoon Seo comes later, just like normal...

363
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:51,640
Please treat her kindly as you normally do!

364
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,000
He's so prickly.

365
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,330
It's about time for Yoon Seo to get here.

366
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,490
Just like normal.

367
00:28:00,490 --> 00:28:03,840
 Oh Yoon Seo 

368
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:07,990
 Oh Yoon Seo (Oh Jin Sim)
 Family: Single child 
 Debut: 2004 Ghada Chocolate CF 

369
00:28:10,670 --> 00:28:12,700
 You just have to think of her comfortably. Think comfortably. 

370
00:28:12,700 --> 00:28:15,540
 It's the same as getting an intern here at our firm. 

371
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:19,710
 Just give her an idea of how the company runs. 

372
00:28:19,710 --> 00:28:21,580
 In exchange, I also have a condition. 

373
00:28:21,580 --> 00:28:24,400
 Deal! Just say the word, whatever it is. 

374
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,290
 If she says that she's going to leave first, then don't try to stop her at all. 

375
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,790
 Deal! 

376
00:28:42,370 --> 00:28:44,830
She's already late on her first day.

377
00:28:44,830 --> 00:28:48,850
Should I have gone to escort her in since it's her first day? She's a little late.

378
00:29:08,450 --> 00:29:11,450
Oh Yoon Seo is here.

379
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,230
She's here, she's here! She's here! She's here.

393
00:30:21,290 --> 00:30:24,450
I see that everyone is out here.

394
00:30:27,270 --> 00:30:31,710
Hello. I'm Oh Yoon Seo.

395
00:30:31,710 --> 00:30:34,360
- Hello.
 - Hello.

396
00:30:34,360 --> 00:30:37,210
Please take care of me from now on.

397
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:40,350
I'll be lacking a lot, but please watch over me prettily.

398
00:30:40,350 --> 00:30:45,420
Of course. Since you're pretty, we have to look over you prettily.

399
00:30:45,420 --> 00:30:47,820
Thank you. Ah.

400
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,110
You must be the CEO.

401
00:30:50,110 --> 00:30:54,520
I am Yoon Joon Gyoo, this law firm's CEO.

402
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:58,730
Ah, so you are. It's nice to meet you, Mr. CEO.

403
00:30:58,730 --> 00:31:02,740
Nice to meet you. This is nothing special.

404
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:06,170
- I bought this with my own money to welcome you. 
- Oh my goodness!

405
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,090
Thank you so much!

406
00:31:09,090 --> 00:31:13,220
I didn't know that everyone would welcome me like this.

407
00:31:13,220 --> 00:31:18,130
I will become a law firm employee who works very diligently from now on.

408
00:31:18,130 --> 00:31:21,030
I will make sure to repay this huge welcome with work.

409
00:31:21,870 --> 00:31:26,450
Amazing! I thought I was listening to your award acceptance speech.

410
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:30,060
Excuse me, what cosmetic products do you use?

411
00:31:30,770 --> 00:31:34,480
- Your clothes look expensive too. 
- Thank you.

412
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:36,990
Then shall we get to work?

413
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:41,510
Yes. What should I do?

414
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,220
Hello, I'm Oh Yoon Seo.

415
00:31:53,630 --> 00:31:58,380
Do you not know me? I'm Oh Yoon Seo.

416
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:06,170
I came out in a lot of commercials.

417
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:09,110
I did an advertisement for that notebook, too.

418
00:32:11,230 --> 00:32:13,100
 ALWAYS Law Firm 

419
00:32:15,650 --> 00:32:17,690
My notebook, your notebook.

420
00:32:17,690 --> 00:32:20,220
Ssamsong Notebook.

421
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:28,570
Do you really not know who I am?

422
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:41,160
I did a commercial for this sofa, too.

423
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:47,680
A sofa is not meant to be sat on.

424
00:32:49,210 --> 00:32:50,960
It's meant to hold you.

425
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:55,590
Acemiss sofa.

426
00:33:13,190 --> 00:33:15,450
Don't you look at me as water!

427
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:27,620
I'm not just water.

428
00:33:27,620 --> 00:33:29,690
I'm something special.

429
00:33:29,690 --> 00:33:32,590
So, you drink too!

430
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:40,520
Exactly how long are you going to do that?

431
00:33:48,710 --> 00:33:56,280
No, it's just... I find it fascinating that a person from Korea doesn't know me.

432
00:33:56,280 --> 00:33:59,200
- Miss Oh Jin Sim.
 - I am Oh Yoon Seo.

433
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:02,620
There are several rules that you have to follow while working with me, Oh Jin Sim.

434
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,640
- The first is that you must be on time. I detest people who are late.
 - Ah.

435
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:07,690
Yes.

436
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:09,410
The second is to get off work on time.

437
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:13,730
I also detest people who can't complete their assigned work within working hours.

438
00:34:13,730 --> 00:34:17,720
And third, there is a rule that you as my secretary must follow.

439
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:21,840
One moment. Se-secretary?

440
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:26,250
It has gotten tough for you to make living after the scandal. Saying that you'd use your old background in law,

441
00:34:26,250 --> 00:34:28,840
you got hired by this competitive law firm where it's so hard for people with higher qualifications to get in

442
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:31,650
through your network. Aren't I correct?

443
00:34:34,850 --> 00:34:37,930
So that's the concept that's been set.

444
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:40,590
Okay, I understand.

445
00:34:40,590 --> 00:34:45,080
Then what action should I do from now on?

446
00:34:45,790 --> 00:34:49,500
I'm asking just in case, but do you have any experience working as a secretary?

447
00:34:49,500 --> 00:34:51,080
Of course not.

448
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:53,800
Is there anything that you know when it comes to working in a law firm?

449
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:56,250
No, there isn't.

450
00:34:57,440 --> 00:34:58,850
Can you answer the phone?

451
00:34:58,850 --> 00:35:00,780
Of course, I answer extremely well.

452
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:03,280
I hold onto my phone all day long.

453
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:05,990
There was this one time, I called an international number—

454
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:08,230
Then, you will start by doing that today.

455
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:11,140
If a call comes in, you can put  those calls through to my office.

456
00:35:12,890 --> 00:35:16,520
Leave it to me, that's my expertise.

457
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:27,040
He's a little picky.

458
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:33,370
Well, there are picky lawyers among them.

459
00:35:33,370 --> 00:35:37,130
Oh, it might help me research my character.

460
00:35:48,610 --> 00:35:52,580
My predecessor must've have done a really good job.

461
00:35:57,340 --> 00:36:02,340
"Please take care of our Lawyer Kwon!"

462
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,670
Yes!

463
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,040
 Transformation to Secretary Yoon Seo complete! 

464
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,180
 I will work hard~ 

465
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,520
She's pretty.

466
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:32,150
Mr. President, she must be doing better than we thought.

467
00:36:32,150 --> 00:36:33,600
That's right.

468
00:36:34,580 --> 00:36:37,950
Anyway, pay special attention to Yoon Seo until she adjusts well.

469
00:36:37,950 --> 00:36:40,540
Don't send a separate road manager. You take charge of transporting her between work and home.

470
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:42,970
Yes. I am already doing that.

471
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:46,350
Good job. Be careful that it doesn't reach the ears of others.

472
00:36:46,350 --> 00:36:49,390
This has to do with Yoon Seo's future, so raise your awareness level.

473
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,970
Yes. I understand, Mr. President.

474
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,440
Why? Are you displeased?

475
00:36:58,440 --> 00:37:00,930
No, I...

476
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:03,560
I just wanted to say that you are impressive.

477
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:05,400
That's so unexpected.

478
00:37:06,450 --> 00:37:08,870
How am I impressive? Tell me in more detail.

479
00:37:08,870 --> 00:37:11,410
You treat your actors like your own family members.

480
00:37:11,410 --> 00:37:14,560
To be honest, if one couldn't bring in income for the past two years,

481
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:18,900
other agencies would have already terminated the contract, but...

482
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,240
You are impressive.

483
00:37:21,240 --> 00:37:25,220
I am quite humane. I shouldn't do this in this field.

484
00:37:25,220 --> 00:37:28,330
Wait a minute. Why does she look like this?

485
00:37:29,060 --> 00:37:32,130
Why are her clothes so tight?

486
00:37:32,130 --> 00:37:33,960
Because she's been eating a bit more lately.

487
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,080
Oh, really? Tell her to diet.

488
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,170
- Tell her to lose 10 kg. 
 - Excuse me?

489
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:41,010
Why? Are you displeased?

490
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:42,750
You want to diet with her?

491
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:46,020
You are impressive.

492
00:37:57,270 --> 00:38:00,830
 Secretary Oh Yoon Seo looks amazing, no~?
Très bien~~ 

493
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:04,340
 Full of secretary vibes. I'm proud of you, Yoon Seo. 

494
00:38:04,340 --> 00:38:07,090
If I said I would do it, then I will.

495
00:38:20,700 --> 00:38:23,820
Yes. It is the office of

496
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:27,940
Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok of Always Law Firm.

497
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:29,780
Yes.

498
00:38:29,780 --> 00:38:33,240
You want to... talk to him?

499
00:38:34,360 --> 00:38:36,120
Yes.

500
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:49,040
What is she doing?

501
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:54,630
Mr. Lawyer.

502
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:56,840
What are you doing right now?

503
00:38:56,840 --> 00:39:00,980
The line is too short to connect to you.

504
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,010
Yes, I am Kwon Jeong Rok.

505
00:39:11,930 --> 00:39:14,510
Ah yes, I am aware.

506
00:39:14,510 --> 00:39:17,550
I will send the documents by today.

507
00:39:17,550 --> 00:39:19,540
If you want further discussion, give me a call.

508
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,500
Yes. Yes.

509
00:39:22,970 --> 00:39:25,100
This, the phone line

510
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:28,150
should be longer.

511
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:30,270
Don't you know how to connect to another extension?

512
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:32,890
Extension?

513
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:40,290
Forget it. I will personally answer the phone.

514
00:39:48,600 --> 00:39:51,190
Oh Jin Sim, please copy this.

515
00:39:51,190 --> 00:39:52,720
Yes.

516
00:39:56,030 --> 00:39:57,500
How many copies would you like?

517
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:59,340
- Two copies. 
 - Yes.

518
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,580
If you can quickly turn away, I will give it to you shortly.

519
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:15,190
I will also do the copies.

520
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:24,950
Then, what should I do?

521
00:40:24,950 --> 00:40:27,110
Just stay comfortably there.

522
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:42,770
- What should we eat for lunch? 
 - What is there that's tasty?

523
00:40:44,910 --> 00:40:46,700
How about ox blood stew?

524
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:53,600
I want to drink water.

525
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:55,420
Where should I...

526
00:40:56,870 --> 00:40:59,580
If you need anything, tell me anytime.

527
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:02,690
You need to eat, right?

528
00:41:02,690 --> 00:41:06,100
In front of here, there is a luxurious Japanese restaurant. Let's eat sushi.

529
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,860
- How about sushi? 
 - Yes, Mr. President. We would like that.

530
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:11,820
The tuna sashimi is amazing there.

531
00:41:11,820 --> 00:41:15,610
Tuna sashimi? It sounds delicious.

532
00:41:21,020 --> 00:41:23,120
It would've been nice if Oh Yoon Seo also came with us.

533
00:41:23,120 --> 00:41:24,800
That's right.

534
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:26,920
But then, it is her first day of work.

535
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:29,680
Yet, she wants to wait until Lawyer Kwon is done with his work to eat with him.

536
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,890
Even her heart is pretty!

537
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:35,400
It's cold. Let's go, quickly.

538
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,850
The luxurious Japanese restaurant is at that intersection, right?

539
00:41:38,850 --> 00:41:41,570
Oh, yeah! Tuna sashimi sushi!

540
00:41:41,570 --> 00:41:45,620
It reminds me of the tuna sashimi I ate last winter in Hokkaido.

541
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:51,000
- We shall go quickly. 
 - Let's go eat kimchi stew. Tuna kimchi stew.

542
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:57,780
- I'm suddenly craving it. 
 - Then, if we are going to eat canned tuna, how about tuna sandwich?

543
00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:00,520
At the corner of the intersection, the sandwich shop is nice.

544
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:04,700
Lawyer Dan, you are flirting with the part-timer over there, right?

545
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:10,770
You just had a crush on the second son of that beef stew place, so you were always trying to eat there every day.

546
00:42:10,770 --> 00:42:13,550
Lawyer Dan is a hopeless romantic, you know.

547
00:42:13,550 --> 00:42:16,910
Love is always on the move.

548
00:42:16,910 --> 00:42:19,320
Then, let us go.

549
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:22,420
Let's go to eat tuna kimchi stew!

550
00:42:27,080 --> 00:42:29,500
Let's go together!

551
00:42:33,540 --> 00:42:37,600
Can I really sit here comfortably while doing nothing?

552
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,100
Oh, I'm hungry.

553
00:42:47,830 --> 00:42:49,580
- Mr. Lawyer. 
 - Yes.

554
00:42:49,580 --> 00:42:54,020
Excuse me.  Lunchtime was 20 minutes ago.

555
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,650
Oh, it's already time.

556
00:42:57,650 --> 00:43:01,110
For reference, I cannot go to a restaurant filled with people.

557
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,680
And?

558
00:43:05,030 --> 00:43:07,830
I have plans today. Today, you will eat alone.

559
00:43:07,830 --> 00:43:10,400
- No! 
 - Why can't I?

560
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:13,660
I can't go to a restaurant alone.

561
00:43:13,660 --> 00:43:16,050
- Why can't you? 
 - What do you mean by why? How can I eat alone?

562
00:43:16,050 --> 00:43:18,750
People already whisper about me because of my scandal.

563
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:22,760
What will people say when they see me miserably eating alone?

564
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:26,960
How is it miserable to eat alone? I eat alone almost every day.

565
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:30,910
I am not you, Mr. Lawyer. I am Oh Yoon Seo.

566
00:43:30,910 --> 00:43:34,630
I am Oh Yoon Seo, the Hallyu goddess that took over the continent.

567
00:43:34,630 --> 00:43:37,250
So, how can I eat alone at a restaurant?

568
00:43:37,250 --> 00:43:39,560
Then, order take-out and eat that.

569
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:45,890
Did he really go? Leaving me alone?

570
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:57,130
If we ate with Oh Yoon Seo, we could've eaten tuna sashimi sushi.

571
00:43:57,130 --> 00:44:00,600
Isn't Oh Yoon Seo seriously amazing in real life?

572
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:04,270
Seeing that face on TV so close in front of me,

573
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:06,570
it feels like watching a drama.

574
00:44:06,570 --> 00:44:09,560
- Lawyer Choi, do you know this? 
 - Know what?

575
00:44:09,560 --> 00:44:12,340
You can see that drama again soon enough.

576
00:44:13,070 --> 00:44:17,320
- Let's do a marathon of that show together. 
 - CEO!

577
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:19,750
Please eat this piece of tuna.

578
00:44:19,750 --> 00:44:22,030
However, isn't it weird?

579
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:24,900
Even if a celebrity doesn't go on a broadcast anymore,

580
00:44:24,900 --> 00:44:28,200
they still do online broadcasting, or operate online shopping malls.

581
00:44:28,200 --> 00:44:30,350
Isn't it surprising that she is a law firm secretary?

582
00:44:30,350 --> 00:44:34,260
That's right. Why does she suddenly want to live an ordinary life? Why?

583
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:39,080
I heard she studied law before.

584
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:42,160
Perhaps, isn't it because she wanted to work in this field in the beginning?

585
00:44:42,160 --> 00:44:46,700
That's right. That must be it. You're right. That is the reason. Would there be other reasons?

586
00:44:46,700 --> 00:44:49,120
Hurry up and eat. The stew will get cold.

587
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,030
It's overcooked.

588
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:58,290
I'm hungry. There should be something to eat here.

589
00:45:03,910 --> 00:45:05,970
Is there nothing?

590
00:45:05,970 --> 00:45:09,990
What is wrong with the employee lounge? There's not even a chocolate snack.

591
00:45:14,870 --> 00:45:16,690
Should I eat this?

592
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,540
Oh, I'm hungry. There's hot water.

593
00:46:05,660 --> 00:46:08,040
What are you doing over there?

594
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:10,810
I am watering the plants.

595
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,780
Who are you?

596
00:46:15,780 --> 00:46:17,330
I am Lee Doo Seob.

597
00:46:17,330 --> 00:46:21,160
Moo Seob— Mr. Doo Seob. 
  (TN: Moo seob is scary in Korean) 

598
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:25,910
Hello, are you here for a consultation?

599
00:46:25,910 --> 00:46:28,590
No, not for a consultation.

600
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:31,380
I am the office—

601
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:35,510
Oh, you are here to resolve a bitter grudge ( sounds like "the office" ) in your heart. To make a complaint. I see.

602
00:46:35,510 --> 00:46:37,160
It's not that.

603
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:40,730
Mr. Office Manager.

604
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:42,320
Hello.

605
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,380
- You're here?
 - Yes.

606
00:46:43,380 --> 00:46:45,610
- Did you eat something? 
 - Yes, I ate.

607
00:46:45,610 --> 00:46:49,290
Yoon Seo, this is our office manager.

608
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:52,560
Hello. I am Office Manager Lee Doo Seob.

609
00:46:53,310 --> 00:46:57,080
Hello. I am Oh Yoon Seo.

610
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:01,000
Oh, Job's tears tea?

611
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:06,270
I know this is not your style, Yoon Seo. 
 You should eat something sweet after eating.

612
00:47:06,270 --> 00:47:08,650
Sweet caramel macchiato.

613
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:11,750
Thank you so much.

614
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:16,230
 Sushi Sashimi 

615
00:47:19,700 --> 00:47:22,490
  Sushi for the Soul 

616
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:28,320
 How can I eat by myself? Everyone is already whispering about me because of my scandal. 

617
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:32,620
 What would they say if I eat alone looking miserable? 

618
00:47:39,870 --> 00:47:43,660
Mr. Kwon, have you still not eaten?

619
00:47:44,780 --> 00:47:46,660
It's not mine...

620
00:47:49,220 --> 00:47:52,160
Everyone is chatting with Oh Yoon Seo.

621
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:57,060
I wish someone more professional had come who could help you with your career.

622
00:48:03,470 --> 00:48:05,160
Ms. Yang.

623
00:48:05,160 --> 00:48:09,740
- What's this? 
- It's caramel arigatto... Wait...

624
00:48:09,740 --> 00:48:12,870
You mean caramel macchiato? But why...?

625
00:48:12,870 --> 00:48:17,850
I bought it for myself but don't feel like drinking anymore.

626
00:48:17,850 --> 00:48:20,010
- If you don't like it, I'll... 
- No, I'll drink it.

627
00:48:20,010 --> 00:48:22,050
It would be a waste to throw it away.

628
00:48:27,310 --> 00:48:31,610
That's what happened. Because of you, I almost gave up on my bar exam.

629
00:48:31,610 --> 00:48:33,060
Wow, really?

630
00:48:33,060 --> 00:48:35,620
But I'm not such a weak guy.

631
00:48:35,620 --> 00:48:38,360
I passed the exam and now I'm here

632
00:48:38,360 --> 00:48:41,250
and became a real man.

633
00:48:41,790 --> 00:48:44,120
I see. You are cool!

634
00:48:44,120 --> 00:48:46,810
My mom always told me

635
00:48:46,810 --> 00:48:50,780
that, "Manners maketh man,"

636
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:52,770
and that's how I can meet a nice lady.

637
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,190
And finally, I think that moment came.

638
00:49:05,550 --> 00:49:07,780
Hello.

639
00:49:07,780 --> 00:49:10,750
Yoon Seo, here's your coffee! Oh, everyone was here.

640
00:49:10,750 --> 00:49:14,400
Even Mr. Kwon. Oh yeah, this was in your office.

641
00:49:15,410 --> 00:49:18,810
It was in my house. Want some coffee?

642
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:22,070
No thanks. Everyone please go and start working now.

643
00:49:22,070 --> 00:49:26,430
Already? I just came back, though.

644
00:49:29,290 --> 00:49:32,950
I think we should go out and work.  Yeah, let's go out now.

645
00:49:32,950 --> 00:49:34,780
Manners maketh man. Yeah.

646
00:49:34,780 --> 00:49:37,400
Here's your cup of coffee.

647
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,140
Excuse me.

648
00:49:47,750 --> 00:49:51,500
What should I do in the afternoon?

649
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,950
- Whatever you can do. 
- Pardon me?

650
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:58,210
Just spend your time and go. Seems like there are lots of others who like you.

651
00:49:58,210 --> 00:50:00,210
Drink coffee with them and chat, but

652
00:50:00,300 --> 00:50:04,300
don't do it in my personal space.

653
00:50:11,950 --> 00:50:13,850
Excuse me!

654
00:50:14,520 --> 00:50:17,320
Did I do something wrong?

655
00:50:17,320 --> 00:50:20,750
I was waiting for you without eating anything until now,

656
00:50:20,750 --> 00:50:24,010
but all you do is get angry at me without saying sorry.

657
00:50:24,010 --> 00:50:26,910
Just why are you acting like this to me?

658
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:31,860
- Ms. Oh Jin Sim. 
- I told you, I'm Oh Yoon Seo!

659
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:34,020
This is a workplace.

660
00:50:34,570 --> 00:50:37,320
- What? 
- I don't know what you heard from your boss,

661
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:40,250
but this is not a place where you can rest and play all day long.

662
00:50:40,250 --> 00:50:42,510
Since you've volunteered to be a secretary and come here,

663
00:50:42,510 --> 00:50:47,460
shouldn't you at least not bother those who are working seriously?

664
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:50,760
I'm not intending to bother them.

665
00:50:50,760 --> 00:50:55,500
Since we're on the subject,  I'm honestly not that happy to have a person that views work lightly like you.

666
00:50:55,500 --> 00:50:58,880
You are famous enough to appear on TV, but that doesn't apply in this place,

667
00:50:58,880 --> 00:51:02,620
so I hope you will be mindful as well.

668
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,420
Be mindful?

669
00:51:05,420 --> 00:51:06,950
Yes.

670
00:51:09,360 --> 00:51:11,570
I...

671
00:51:13,420 --> 00:51:15,630
I'm not here to play either!

672
00:51:15,630 --> 00:51:19,140
You say that, yet you come to work dressed like this?

673
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,700
I didn't even start the actual work yet.

674
00:51:23,700 --> 00:51:28,650
Aren't you being stereotypically judging of me just by looking at my clothing?

675
00:51:30,090 --> 00:51:31,920
Yeah, I think you're right. Stereotype.

676
00:51:31,920 --> 00:51:35,960
Just as you said, I know that there hasn't been enough time to pass judgment on someone.

677
00:51:35,960 --> 00:51:38,000
But Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

678
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:40,150
You should have at least come on time

679
00:51:40,150 --> 00:51:43,330
so I don't form such a judgment.

680
00:51:43,930 --> 00:51:47,280
- But that's... 
-  If you really want to work as my secretary, even for just a little while,

681
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,400
you should first wear proper clothes,

682
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:53,250
or just hang around for three months.

683
00:52:06,580 --> 00:52:09,670
Oh my gosh, I hate him!

684
00:52:11,270 --> 00:52:13,310
I didn't know I would be a secretary!

685
00:52:13,310 --> 00:52:15,670
If I'd known, I wouldn't have worn this!

686
00:52:15,670 --> 00:52:17,580
And was I late because I wanted to be?

687
00:52:17,580 --> 00:52:21,060
Joon told me to be here by 10 am!

688
00:52:22,320 --> 00:52:26,920
How could he say that without knowing anything about me? I'm not going to leave it like this.

689
00:52:29,410 --> 00:52:31,110
Yes.

690
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,870
I don't think that person will even make a week.

691
00:52:34,850 --> 00:52:37,860
I'm sure the person will give up even by tomorrow.

692
00:52:37,860 --> 00:52:41,210
To put it simply, that person is just hopeless.

693
00:52:42,640 --> 00:52:44,120
Hopeless?

694
00:52:44,120 --> 00:52:47,270
Yes, hopeless.

695
00:52:48,340 --> 00:52:51,160
She kept denying things even though the proof was right in front of me.

696
00:52:51,160 --> 00:52:53,660
It drove me crazy.

697
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:56,270
Oh well, she won't last long anyway.

698
00:52:56,270 --> 00:53:00,400
Anyway, thanks for helping me. I was able to get the evidence thanks to you.

699
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,750
 It's no problem. 

700
00:53:03,250 --> 00:53:06,860
Oh wait. When were you coming to Seoul again? The day after tomorrow?

701
00:53:06,860 --> 00:53:10,240
- Does Yeo Reum also know that?
 -   No, she doesn't know yet. 

702
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:12,020
Really?

703
00:53:12,020 --> 00:53:15,060
You guys should solve your problem yourselves.

704
00:53:15,930 --> 00:53:17,370
I need to go to the trial now.

705
00:53:17,370 --> 00:53:21,370
-  Okay, bye. Let's do a come-back party soon. 
- Sure. 

706
00:53:40,470 --> 00:53:42,210
Excuse me.

707
00:53:43,050 --> 00:53:44,840
We need to talk.

708
00:53:44,840 --> 00:53:47,000
I have a trial now.

709
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:49,980
- But I have to say—
 -  You can go home at 6 pm.

710
00:53:55,670 --> 00:53:59,470
I've never seen such a prickly man before! What, I was late?

711
00:53:59,470 --> 00:54:02,310
My clothes? Yeah, it's possible not to like it.

712
00:54:02,310 --> 00:54:06,150
But he could've just taught me! I'm there to learn!

713
00:54:06,150 --> 00:54:09,370
This is like, he's dissatisfied even if I'm working

714
00:54:09,370 --> 00:54:13,490
and dissatisfied even when I'm resting! What does he want me to do?!

715
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:16,450
You're right. What's he wanting from you?

716
00:54:16,450 --> 00:54:19,700
He's weird. What's wrong with him?

717
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:24,010
I don't know. I guess he doesn't like my very existence!

718
00:54:24,010 --> 00:54:27,640
Wait, you... He doesn't like Oh Yoon-Seo?

719
00:54:27,640 --> 00:54:30,090
I really can't understand that!

720
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,870
Unless he doesn't like women, how could he not like you?

721
00:54:32,870 --> 00:54:36,120
That's what I mean! I'm so annoyed, seriously!

722
00:54:36,120 --> 00:54:38,870
I don't care about the drama. I'm just going to quit it all!

723
00:54:38,870 --> 00:54:41,250
Yoon Seo, why are you saying that?

724
00:54:41,250 --> 00:54:43,920
I know you're a good person.  Let's just endure a bit more.

725
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:46,630
No, I can't!  My patience is out of control now.

726
00:54:46,630 --> 00:54:51,090
I can't do this anymore. This is it. It's over! Cut! Cut!

727
00:54:51,710 --> 00:54:55,640
Why do you keep saying "cut" even though it's not your thing to say?

728
00:54:56,770 --> 00:54:59,060
Umm, yes, it's cut. Cut! It's over!

729
00:54:59,060 --> 00:55:01,650
I'll say something to him!

730
00:55:01,650 --> 00:55:04,230
He's not something great just because he's a lawyer.

731
00:55:10,570 --> 00:55:14,600
Sorry, there's a shot going on so please wait for few minutes.

732
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,310
Sure.

733
00:55:18,850 --> 00:55:21,540
Because you said that naturally, it was nice when you were in a romantic relationship.

734
00:55:21,540 --> 00:55:23,460
I said I want to sleep with you.

735
00:55:23,460 --> 00:55:24,970
Did I ever say I wanted to date you?

736
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:29,060
What the heck? Did they pay for the road or what?

737
00:55:30,610 --> 00:55:33,360
I feel sorry for them.

738
00:55:33,360 --> 00:55:34,810
It's really tough to do an outdoor shoot in the winter.

739
00:55:34,810 --> 00:55:37,810
Cut! Good job!

00:57:03,950 --> 00:57:08,170
You look pretty, Oh Yoon Seo.

764
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:22,600
 Listen to me for just a second. 

765
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,670
 Let me go. Let me go! 

766
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:27,740
 Let me go right now! 

767
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:32,190
 Let me go! Let me go! 

768
00:57:33,610 --> 00:57:37,750
 Just punch me. That will hurt less. 

769
00:57:37,750 --> 00:57:41,250
 How could you meet someone else? 

770
00:57:41,250 --> 00:57:43,960
 How could you love two people 

771
00:57:43,960 --> 00:57:46,310
 with one heart? 

772
00:57:46,310 --> 00:57:50,440
 It was my mistake. Please forgive me. 

773
00:57:52,770 --> 00:57:54,510
 Forgive you? 

774
00:57:55,160 --> 00:57:59,680
 Are you kidding? I'll never forgive you! 

775
00:58:40,590 --> 00:58:43,520
So cold.

776
00:58:45,780 --> 00:58:48,350
Is she not up yet?

777
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:54,760
Yoon Seo.

778
00:58:57,380 --> 00:58:59,860
Oh Yoon Seo, are you sleeping?

779
00:59:01,780 --> 00:59:04,250
Yoon Seo.

780
00:59:07,680 --> 00:59:10,990
Oh Yoon Seo!

781
00:59:10,990 --> 00:59:13,500
Yoon Seo, wake up!

782
00:59:15,390 --> 00:59:17,290
Hey.

783
00:59:17,290 --> 00:59:19,800
- Did you sleep here? 
 - Yeah

784
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:25,700
Why? You've never been in the study since you moved in and organized your luggage!

785
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:30,010
There was something I had to look for. What time is it now?

786
00:59:30,010 --> 00:59:33,490
- 7:30 AM.
 - Hm?

787
00:59:34,820 --> 00:59:36,880
Why?

788
00:59:38,340 --> 00:59:42,110
Why did you wake me up now! You should've come earlier! Oh no, what should I do?!

789
00:59:42,110 --> 00:59:44,400
- What's wrong?
 - I'm late!

790
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:47,470
What is this? Just yesterday, she said she was going to quit.

791
00:59:47,470 --> 00:59:50,050
♫  Yes, for me everything is new. What will it feel like? 
 You know, right?  ♫

792
00:59:50,050 --> 00:59:53,300

♫   What you  gonna do?   ♫

810
01:00:50,060 --> 01:00:52,500

 ♫   What you gonna do? What you gonna do?  ♫

811
01:00:52,550 --> 01:00:55,550
- It's not bad. 
 - Really? Do you think there's a chance of winning?

812
01:00:55,550 --> 01:00:58,060
It's worth taking a shot.

813
01:00:58,060 --> 01:01:02,240
What a relief. Thank for helping even though you must be busy.

814
01:01:02,240 --> 01:01:04,610
Especially not anyone else but you, Kwon Jeong Rok.

815
01:01:04,610 --> 01:01:07,940
Especially because it's not anyone else but you.

816
01:01:07,940 --> 01:01:09,840
What? That just made my heart pound.

817
01:01:09,840 --> 01:01:11,940
Yeah, right.

818
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:15,640
Then again, I saw that a heart throbbing incident actually happened to you.

819
01:01:15,640 --> 01:01:20,220
- What? 
 - I heard everything, that a beauty came as secretary?

820
01:01:21,930 --> 01:01:24,270
Who did you hear it from? Joon Gyoo?

821
01:01:24,270 --> 01:01:27,410
No, I met Lawyer Choi Yoon Hyeok yesterday at court.

822
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:30,860
What a consistently frivolous person. He said he'd keep it as a secret.

823
01:01:30,860 --> 01:01:35,710
Don't worry, I'll keep the secret. But how is it working with a Hallyu beauty?

824
01:01:35,710 --> 01:01:39,340
Does it feel like walking on top of a cloud?

825
01:01:40,760 --> 01:01:44,740
Rather than a cloud, shall I call it thin ice?

826
01:01:44,740 --> 01:01:47,670
- What? 
 - There's something like that.

827
01:01:49,240 --> 01:01:51,140
Hello, Secretary Yang.

828
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:52,990
Ah, yes.

829
01:01:52,990 --> 01:01:56,780
- If you want coffee, shall I give you a glass? 
 - No, I'm good.

830
01:01:58,540 --> 01:02:02,080
But I was so surprised when I saw you came as a secretary.

831
01:02:02,080 --> 01:02:06,180
I heard although you went into a law school, you got kicked out.

832
01:02:06,180 --> 01:02:10,550
Who says that? I left the school myself.

833
01:02:10,550 --> 01:02:12,380
Is that true?

834
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:18,090
But Yoon Seo. Since I'm a few years older, is it okay if I just call you Yoon Seo?

835
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:23,380
- Of course. 
 - It seems like you don't know much because it's your first time being a secretary.

836
01:02:23,380 --> 01:02:27,140
But a law firm secretary is not just someone who runs simple errands.

837
01:02:27,140 --> 01:02:30,430
It's right to see them as a legal partner of a lawyer.

838
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:35,420
I hope you will try harder to become a help to our lawyer.

839
01:02:38,420 --> 01:02:40,380
- I got it. 
- If you understood—

840
01:02:40,380 --> 01:02:44,670
- Secretary Yang, do you know the American drama "Madman" by chance? 
 - Pardon?

841
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:49,690
The directors said it was so fun so I watched it, but I thought it was boring.

842
01:02:49,690 --> 01:02:54,760
Anyway, there is a character just like you in that drama.

843
01:02:54,760 --> 01:02:59,930
An old secretary that tells young secretaries to do this and that.

844
01:02:59,930 --> 01:03:02,520
You're that kind of character huh?

845
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:06,440
- A character? What are you—
 - Okay, I understand.

846
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:12,060
Thank you for the advice. I'm going to really try my best!

847
01:03:20,310 --> 01:03:22,370
♫  The wind was blowing then  ♫

848
01:03:22,370 --> 01:03:26,370
If the phone rings, I pick it up and—

849
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:32,650
"Yes? I'll transfer you to Jeong Rok," and then press the star.

850
01:03:32,750 --> 01:03:36,450
If I press number 2.

851
01:03:36,470 --> 01:03:39,130
♫   I just wanna be a star for you  ♫

852
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:43,320
Yes! 
 ♫  It's contained in my hidden feelings.  ♫

853
01:03:43,320 --> 01:03:45,420
 Things To Do In The Morning! 
 ♫  It's contained in my hidden feelings.  ♫

854
01:03:45,420 --> 01:03:47,580
 1. Master how to work the call extensions  
♫  I will show you  ♫

855
01:03:47,580 --> 01:03:50,370
Okay. Now try doing as I told you to.
♫  When you have a dark and tiring day  ♫

856
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:51,820
Okay. 
 ♫  day I will hug you.  ♫

857
01:03:51,820 --> 01:03:53,380
Then...
 ♫  day I will hug you.  ♫

858
01:03:53,380 --> 01:04:00,220
Select the paper type, 2 copies, and then start!

859
01:04:01,710 --> 01:04:07,430
It worked! Thank you so much!

860
01:04:07,430 --> 01:04:09,660
If you're really thankful,

861
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:13,640
can you tell me what skincare you use at night? Then I'll be thankful.

862
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:16,090
Oh, I—

863
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:18,740
She leaves without even listening.

864
01:04:23,410 --> 01:04:27,150
Now, I cleared copying.

865
01:04:27,150 --> 01:04:30,320
What do I do next?

866
01:04:33,040 --> 01:04:36,340
Lawyer Kwon! Are you coming from the court?

867
01:04:36,340 --> 01:04:38,310
Yes.

868
01:04:38,310 --> 01:04:43,240
Oh yeah, I forgot to tell you yesterday but we're having a welcoming for Oh Yoon Seo today.

869
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:46,110
Everyone's coming so don't be late.

870
01:04:46,110 --> 01:04:48,850
Why do a welcoming for someone leaving after three months?

871
01:04:48,850 --> 01:04:52,470
All the employees want it. Since she's only staying three months,

872
01:04:52,470 --> 01:04:56,670
they feel that every single moment is more precious and lovely. Well, they're right about that.

873
01:04:56,670 --> 01:05:00,640
In this situation, we should welcome her even more passionately. You're coming later, right?

874
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,470
- I have a meeting with a client. 
 - I know.

875
01:05:03,470 --> 01:05:07,710
I also know that you'll be ending early. You won't be drinking anyway.

876
01:05:07,710 --> 01:05:11,300
- I am going to drink. I might even get drunk. 
- Oh, really?

877
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:17,400
That's good! It's more comfortable for us if you're drunk and messy rather than sober.

878
01:05:17,400 --> 01:05:20,510
- What did you just say? 
 - The elevator came. Let's go.

879
01:05:23,890 --> 01:05:26,400
Welcome Lawyer Kwon.

880
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,120
Yes.

881
01:05:28,120 --> 01:05:30,910
You're late today?

882
01:05:30,910 --> 01:05:35,190
- I'm coming back after working outside. 
- Ah, you were working outside.

883
01:05:39,890 --> 01:05:43,510
- You look more appropriate today. 
- Oh really?

884
01:05:52,890 --> 01:05:54,970
- What is it? 
- Yes?

885
01:05:54,970 --> 01:05:57,680
Didn't you follow me because you have something to say?

886
01:05:57,680 --> 01:05:59,760
You know,

887
01:05:59,760 --> 01:06:04,810
I tried organizing a little bit while you were away.

888
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:13,610
The files on your desk were thrown around so messily.

889
01:06:14,450 --> 01:06:20,170
They say that good work comes when your surroundings are neat and clean so I tried to make it as neat as possible.

890
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:25,090
- Oh Jin Sim. 
 - Not Oh Jin Sim but Oh Yoon Seo.

891
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:27,630
Why did you do something I didn't even ask for?

892
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:28,910
What?

893
01:06:28,910 --> 01:06:31,650
The trial documents are mixed up without order.

894
01:06:31,650 --> 01:06:34,990
I can't even find the important document that I need to look at right now.

895
01:06:34,990 --> 01:06:38,800
Oh no. If you let me know what it is, I'll quickly find it and—

896
01:06:38,800 --> 01:06:42,760
Why would you touch someone else's stuff in the first place?

897
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:45,440
It was just so messy so I—

898
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:48,750
Although it may have looked messy to you, it was all according to its own rules.

899
01:06:48,750 --> 01:06:53,250
Have you forgotten that I told you that if there's really nothing to do, just waste your time and leave?

900
01:06:53,250 --> 01:06:56,380
Aren't you being a bit too much?

901
01:06:56,380 --> 01:07:00,740
I was trying to work hard in my own way. Do you really have to get that mad?

902
01:07:00,740 --> 01:07:04,180
Although there's not much that I know to do,

903
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:08,000
I put in my effort to do well if you teach me.

904
01:07:08,000 --> 01:07:10,900
Never mind. Please leave.

905
01:07:14,190 --> 01:07:19,300


906
01:07:21,490 --> 01:07:23,560
Hey.

907
01:07:24,820 --> 01:07:27,590
You, lawyer.

908
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:33,120
Do you not like women by any chance?

909
01:07:34,280 --> 01:07:37,900
- What did you say? 
 - What I'm saying is,

910
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:39,980
men...

911
01:07:40,850 --> 01:07:44,240
Do you not like women?

912
01:07:47,110 --> 01:07:50,060
It must be a pity that your expectation was wrong, but—

913
01:07:50,930 --> 01:07:54,070
What are you doing?

914
01:07:55,740 --> 01:07:59,440
I like women. Very much.

915
01:08:01,290 --> 01:08:03,680
I like them enormously.

916
01:08:04,600 --> 01:08:06,560
Just simply,

917
01:08:07,870 --> 01:08:11,750
I have absolutely no interest in you, Oh Jin Sim.

918
01:08:14,190 --> 01:08:17,100
♫  So make it count  ♫

919
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:20,230
♫  Please remember today  ♫

920
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:23,460
♫  The light wind and the blooming flowers  ♫

921
01:08:23,460 --> 01:08:28,300
♫  I shall hope. Make it count.  ♫

922
01:08:28,300 --> 01:08:31,590
♫  Then make me everlasting.  ♫

923
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:35,120
♫  I will gather every moment  ♫

924
01:08:35,120 --> 01:08:40,850
♫  and I will give them to you. La La  ♫

925
01:08:40,850 --> 01:08:46,210
♫  Time passes again.  ♫

926
01:08:46,210 --> 01:08:48,660
♫  I shall hope.  Make it count  ♫

927
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,520
♫  Lazing on a bench in the afternoon   ♫

928
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:53,260
 Touch Your Heart  
 ♫  Lie down comfortably, pillowed on my lap  ♫

929
01:08:53,260 --> 01:08:55,620
 You bastard! 

930
01:08:55,620 --> 01:08:58,760
  Please don't touch my desk in the future as well. Then. 

931
01:08:58,760 --> 01:09:00,320
  Then? Then! 

932
01:09:00,320 --> 01:09:03,000
  Her looks, as well as her personality, are just perfect. 

933
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:05,550
 I'm not drunk. 

934
01:09:05,550 --> 01:09:08,660
  It's him! 

935
01:09:08,660 --> 01:09:12,740
 -  Please solve your problems yourselves. 
 - Come on. Yeo Reum likes you though. 

936
01:09:12,740 --> 01:09:19,440
 I'm curious about the relationship between that rich guy and her. It must be a fact that she was there, right? 

937
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:24,410
  I would like to give you a chance to work as my secretary properly. 

938
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:28,130
  Let's start again from the beginning.
