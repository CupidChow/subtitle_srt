1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:04,720


2
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,890
 Touch Your Heart 

3
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:43,820
 Episode 6 

4
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,360
I have something to tell you, Mr. Lawyer.

5
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:55,810
But...

6
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,720
I don't want to tell you now. However,

7
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:05,760
one day I will definitely tell you

8
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:11,930
about this emotion that I'm feeling right now.

9
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:23,460
What is there for her to tell me later?

10
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:25,290
 Samgyeopsal (lettuce wrapped  around grilled pork belly) 

11
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:29,830
I wonder if she likes samgyeopsal. Oh Jin Sim!

12
00:01:33,820 --> 00:01:36,940
Do you possibly... like it?
 (Spoken without a subject, it could sound like he is asking if she likes him) 

13
00:01:36,940 --> 00:01:40,830
Th-that is... So...

14
00:01:40,830 --> 00:01:42,940
Wait, I think so, but...

15
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,940
But since you're asking me all of a sudden,

16
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:48,920
I feel so flustered.

17
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,730
But how did you know that I like you? ( Spoken without the direct object. )

18
00:01:53,730 --> 00:01:55,820
Because pretty much everyone seems to like it.

19
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,120
Pretty much everyone?

20
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:02,360
I guess you're more popular than I thought.

21
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:06,250
- Isn't it non-burdensome and relatively cheap?
 - What?

22
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:09,280
Cheap, you said?

23
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,390
Isn't it cheaper than beef?

24
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:16,570
 Samgyeopsal (Pork Belly) 

25
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:22,630
Oh, wait a minute. So, right now, are you asking me

26
00:02:22,630 --> 00:02:25,800
- if I like samgyeopsal?
 - Yes.

27
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,490
So that we could choose what item we wanted since we came out to eat dinner.

28
00:02:29,490 --> 00:02:32,530
Then what did you think I was talking about when you answered me?

29
00:02:32,530 --> 00:02:35,710
Uh, that's... Um...

30
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:40,110
Gamjatang! About gamjatang...( Potato soup )

31
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:42,850
I thought you were asking me if I liked it and—

32
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:46,570
From what I know, there is no gamjatang restaurant within a one-kilometer distance from here.

33
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:51,320
Then let's eat samgyeopsal. I like samgyeopsal, too. Wow, samgyeopsal!

34
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:56,930
Alright then, let's go eat there. There are no people there, so I think it will be comfortable for you.

35
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:58,630
- Alright.
 - Okay. Let's go.

36
00:02:58,630 --> 00:03:01,310
Wow, samgyeopsal!

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,390
It seems like you really like samgyeopsal.

38
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,190
Yes. I really love it.

39
00:03:22,190 --> 00:03:24,740
You catch onto things so quickly.

40
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:29,710
That's true. Maybe it's because I've met so many different types of people as I've been working as a lawyer,

41
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,560
but I think that I've gotten quicker at catching on to things.

42
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:40,230
Mr. Lawyer. You've never dated, have you?

43
00:03:43,980 --> 00:03:49,470
- Why are you asking so suddenly?
 - Just because. You just seem to be so bad at it.

44
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,020
Then, what about you? Are you good at dating?

45
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,630
Of course. Oh?

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,040
If you don't believe me, then look up some articles.

47
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,650
I was the MC of the center room of a couple matching program.

48
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:05,490
I coached them so well back then.

49
00:04:05,490 --> 00:04:08,890
- Back then, my nickname was—
 - You've been a solo since birth.

50
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,410
What?

51
00:04:11,090 --> 00:04:14,060
The articles say that.

52
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:16,740
Why did you find something like that?

53
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:21,020
"As it turns out, Strong Coffeeshop Love Counselor Oh Yeon Seo has never been in a romantic relationship."

54
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:26,080
'Top Star Oh Yeon Soo,  a regular on tvN's new entertainment show Strong Coffeeshop as a genuine love counselor,

55
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,560
is currently making headlines for being a solo since birth and not having dated once in her life.

56
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,680
You should stop now.

57
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,470
'The producer said she couldn't have learned from experience. Because everything is unfamiliar and she is clueless,

58
00:04:35,470 --> 00:04:39,280
"I want to thank her for her efforts because she reads guidebooks all  night

59
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:41,730
and after studying, she gives tips to the cast."

60
00:04:41,730 --> 00:04:43,900
I told you to stop already, seriously!

61
00:04:45,270 --> 00:04:47,230
I found it.

62
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:53,590
Eat some more, Solo Since Bir— Ah, I'm sorry.

63
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:08,820
We'll probably be busier from tomorrow onward.

64
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:11,820
Because we have to prepare a counterattack?

65
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:19,250
Don't worry too much. I told you this earlier,

66
00:05:19,250 --> 00:05:24,450
but I think that you will win the case. Totally!

67
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:29,360
You're the most skilled lawyer out of all the lawyers I know.

68
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,360
Do you know a lot of lawyers?

69
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:37,460
Lawyer Choi, Lawyer Dan...

70
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:39,700
But anyway.

71
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:46,710
Starting tomorrow, I'm going to prepare myself and come to work with my fists clenched,

72
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:50,030
so let's cheer ourselves on together.

73
00:05:50,730 --> 00:05:52,460
Yes.

74
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:57,950
So did you find a breakthrough somehow?

75
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:02,680
At last week's People's Trial, the story of Im Yoon Hui's receipt of 4.94 billion won in insurance money

76
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:05,020
turned the mood against you.

77
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,370
I'm searching for a way right now.

78
00:06:07,370 --> 00:06:13,840
If we can't get Im Moon Hui's case declared as self-defense,  our firm is going to be disparaged by the whole nation.

79
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:19,700
Well, you know the netizens and social welfare groups are all on Im Yoon Hui's side?

80
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,890
I'm not trying to burden you. Don't feel burdened.

81
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:32,600
But if we get screwed with a case that the whole nation is interested in,

82
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:34,900
I don't think our law firm, having failed, will get any big cases anymore.

83
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,200
What should we do?

84
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,120
I'm not burdening you. Don't feel burdened, Lawyer Kwon.

85
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:45,260
If you've said all you have to say, I'll head out now.

86
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,980
What shall we do, seriously?

87
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:52,290
Even though we only have four lawyers at our law firm, I took out a huge loan and opened this place.

88
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,700
It was all because of a big dream that someday we would be able to out-do Jang &amp; Park.

89
00:06:56,700 --> 00:07:02,880
If we lose this case, won't we only have left a huge loan instead of a big dream?

90
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:08,400
So feel burdened. Be burden— No, don't feel burdened.

91
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,640
Don't worry too much.

92
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,840
Someone said that I'll definitely win the case.

93
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:16,030
Who did?

94
00:07:16,030 --> 00:07:18,830
Anyway, I also agree with those words.

95
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:22,330
So please believe in me until the end and wait.

96
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:28,670
What's with that? Who said that?

97
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,020
Did he see a fortune-teller? He did.

98
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:39,740
A baby?  Girl or boy?

99
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:45,270
Anyway, I would like just being a lucky person so that we can win the case.

100
00:07:53,190 --> 00:07:57,100
No matter how much I search, there are no precedents worth referencing, Mr. Lawyer.

101
00:07:57,100 --> 00:08:01,290
That's because there have been no precedents of cases being acknowledged as self-defense.

102
00:08:06,930 --> 00:08:09,720
You should head home first today.

103
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:13,230
I'm okay. How could I leave you alone and go home?

104
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:17,140
I'm not that disloyal.

105
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:19,670
I don't want to be considered heartless.

106
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:24,400
Haven't you been working overtime the past few days because of me? Go home first today.

107
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,880
When are you going to go home?

108
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:30,530
- I still have work left to do.
 - Hmm.

109
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:39,790
Yeah, Oppa? I told you that I'd get home on my own today. Why did you come?

110
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:42,000
What do you mean, worried?

111
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,920
Fine, I'll come down. Yeah. Yeah, Oppa.

112
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,170
- Then, I'll head home first.
 - Alright.

113
00:09:10,210 --> 00:09:12,340
Mr. Lawyer!

114
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:15,360
Let's go together.

115
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:23,400
You said that you had some work to do.

116
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,570
I decided to do it tomorrow.

117
00:09:25,570 --> 00:09:28,070
In this profession, 52 weeks of work is in effect,

118
00:09:28,070 --> 00:09:32,090
but as lawyers we should take the lead in being law-abiding.

119
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:36,930
Then why have you been working overtime all this time?

120
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:39,170
- That's— 
- Oh, my goodness!

121
00:09:39,170 --> 00:09:43,490
What's wrong with this? It's broken, isn't it? What should I do, Mother?!

122
00:09:45,180 --> 00:09:48,730
- Yes, it's the control room. 
  - Yes.  The elevator stalled.

123
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:50,370
- What floor are you on?
 - The third floor.

124
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:52,640
- Ah, I understand.
 - Please be quick.

125
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,100
Sir, hurry!

126
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,530
Why is she taking so long to come down?

127
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,860
- Hey, Yoon Seo. When are you coming?
 - Hey, Oppa.

128
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:10,020
Right now, the elevator is broken, so I'm stuck in the elevator with Mr. Lawyer.

129
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,910
Are you okay? Are you hurt anywhere?

130
00:10:11,910 --> 00:10:14,000
No, I'm not hurt anywhere.

131
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:17,230
Someone will come quickly, so don't worry too much.

132
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:19,650
I'll call you if something happens.

133
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:21,900
Yeah, Oppa.

134
00:10:28,430 --> 00:10:32,060
Nothing will happen to us, right?

135
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,540
I'm not sure.

136
00:10:33,540 --> 00:10:39,270
In the last ten years, there have been 254 cases of major injury or fatalities in elevator accidents.

137
00:10:39,270 --> 00:10:43,380
Why are you saying something scary like that at a time like this?!

138
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,970
I was just telling you the facts since you asked me.

139
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:54,860
Mr. Lawyer, where are you? Where are you?

140
00:10:56,590 --> 00:11:00,200
Oh Jin Sim, are you alright?

141
00:11:25,130 --> 00:11:27,060
Are you alright?

142
00:11:30,930 --> 00:11:33,880
Yes, we're okay.

143
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:38,100
Yoon Seo, are you okay?

144
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:41,300
- Oppa.
 - You're really not hurt anywhere, right? You were really scared, weren't you?

145
00:11:41,330 --> 00:11:43,000
No, I'm okay.

146
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:46,480
What do you mean, okay? And you should get off work at the proper time. Why are you working overtime and—

147
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:48,200
Quiet.

148
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:51,300
Yoon Seo, wait a moment.

149
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:56,090
- Excuse me, Mr. Lawyer.
 - Yes?

150
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:58,510
I was trying not to say this if at all possible,

151
00:11:58,510 --> 00:12:00,800
but aren't you overworking my Yoon Seo too much?

152
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:01,900
 My  Yoon Seo?

153
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:05,850
Yes, My Yoon Seo! From now on, My Yoon Seo is forbidden to work overtime or work outside the office.

154
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,190
Oppa, why are you acting like that? Are you insane?

155
00:12:07,190 --> 00:12:12,230
I'm right! Why are you working overtime? You're not even an official employee here.

156
00:12:13,330 --> 00:12:16,850
This Oppa seriously... Hurry up and go. Hurry up!

157
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:19,500
Mr. Lawyer, I'm sorry. Don't worry about him.

158
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:20,690
Hurry up and go. Hurry!

159
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:25,060
- No, wait!
 - Hush!
 - Did I say something I wasn't supposed to?
 - Hush up!

160
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,680
You should've just stayed put! What's wrong with you?

161
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,790
Yoon Seo, why are you—?

162
00:12:30,790 --> 00:12:34,360
Oppa, what's with you? How flustered do you think my Mr. Lawyer was because you did that?

163
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:36,250
I'm the one who's taken aback.

164
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,480
I did it because I was thinking of you. You were stuck in an elevator.  Do you know how worried I was?

165
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:45,380
What is there to worry about? I wasn't even alone, I was with Mr. Lawyer!

166
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:49,350
That's why I was even more worried, in case he would try to do something sly to you.

167
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:51,500
What do you mean, sly? Are you crazy?

168
00:12:51,500 --> 00:12:53,170
Why would he do something like that?

169
00:12:53,170 --> 00:12:55,100
Is the lawyer not a man? Huh?

170
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:57,920
Every single Korean man secretly wants you!

171
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,370
- That's right!
 - Right?

172
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:00,850
Yeah. Huh?

173
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:03,910
Anyway, that's not true. Nothing like that happened.

174
00:13:03,910 --> 00:13:05,210
Really?

175
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:09,680
But, Yoon Seo, are you planning to become a secretary for real or something? You've already worked overtime for the past few days.

176
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,160
When was it that you were telling me to work hard?

177
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,600
You shouldn't work too hard! Just get a feel of the vibe

178
00:13:12,700 --> 00:13:16,700
and see how things run.

179
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:20,760
If I just pretend to work, then how would I be able to act naturally?

180
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:23,900
Stop saying such frustrating things!

181
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,120
- Yoon Seo, you really—
 - No, that was—

182
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:29,500
You have really made up your mind.

183
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:32,240
Seeing your passion towards realistic acting,

184
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:34,120
your Oppa is really touched!

185
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:37,730
I'll work harder and even harder to help you with your realistic acting!

186
00:13:37,730 --> 00:13:39,790
Bad acting is for the dogs now.

187
00:13:39,790 --> 00:13:41,330
Fighting!

188
00:13:43,270 --> 00:13:45,140
Fighting!

189
00:13:45,140 --> 00:13:47,550
Alright, hurry up and get in. It's cold.

190
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:57,810
"Oppa"?

191
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:05,360
Aigo, Oppa did something so unnecessary.

192
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:09,520
Mr. Lawyer must already have been startled because the elevator stopped so suddenly.

193
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:25,690
But, the elevator stalling

194
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,580
was so romantic.

195
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:33,100
I thought that my heart was going to stop, too!

196
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:37,230
Why did the elevator stall?

197
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:51,100
 Report of Results of Investigation of Unnatural Death 

198
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,000
 Report of Results of Investigation of Unnatural Death 

199
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,000
 Newspaper articles on Defendant 

200
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:00,100
 Interview of Defendant Im Yoon Hui 

201
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,720
The modern working woman, Oh Yoon Seo.

202
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:12,030
You look so sexy being addicted to your work.

203
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,010
- You're here?
 - Yes.

204
00:15:17,010 --> 00:15:20,600
Shall I make you a cup of coffee? Do you want some sweet instant coffee?

205
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,770
I'm okay. Didn't he warn me not to overwork you yesterday?

206
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:28,630
Your boyfriend.

207
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:31,640
What do you mean, boyfriend? Why would you say...?

208
00:15:33,570 --> 00:15:35,220
Then, is he not?

209
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:39,190
Of course he's not! That oppa is my manag—

210
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:43,670
- He's my older cousin! The one who picks me up when we have company dinners.
 - Ah.

211
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,030
That guy was him?

212
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:50,940
Yes. So please don't ever have such a scary misunderstanding ever again.

213
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:52,630
Yes.

214
00:15:52,630 --> 00:15:56,810
So, are you really not going to drink any coffee?

215
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:00,200
Well then, can I ask you for just one cup?

216
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,730
Yes.

217
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:07,400
The fragrance is amazing.

218
00:16:08,190 --> 00:16:12,280
Hey, did you know that other law firms don't offer such high-quality coffee?

219
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:16,200
They might just have oolong tea, adlay (Job's tear) tea, or coffee mixes, but I'm different.

220
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:19,300
For our Always family members, we—

221
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:22,900
I brought these coffee beans. I got them as a gift over the holidays.

222
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:27,750
We usually only have oolong tea, adlay tea, and coffee mixes. Just like the other law firms.

223
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:31,070
Ah, is that so?

224
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:34,110
You're better than me, Secretary Yang. You're better than me.

225
00:16:34,110 --> 00:16:38,520
While drinking this coffee, let's rebuild a great dream.

226
00:16:39,850 --> 00:16:42,680
- Ah, good morning, Yoon Seo. 
- Good morning! 
- You're here?

227
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,800
Ah, right. You worked overtime with Lawyer Kwon last night, didn't you?

228
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:47,590
Did something happen?

229
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:48,690
Something?

230
00:16:48,690 --> 00:16:52,520
- I heard that the elevator broke down last night. 
- Ah.

231
00:16:53,250 --> 00:16:54,860
- Actually—
 - I heard this from the security guard last night.

232
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:59,090
Yesterday, some people were stuck in the elevator and called the emergency line, so he ran down there in a hurry.

233
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:04,360
He said that a man and woman were embracing each other, about to kiss.

234
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,400
What? No, that's—

235
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:12,180
Isn't it possible that they weren't about to kiss?

236
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:14,290
Who in the world did he say it was? Who did something so daring?

237
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,990
I was really curious about that, so I asked him to describe their faces.

238
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:19,460
He said that he remembers them precisely.

239
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:24,230
He said that the man was tall with round eyes

240
00:17:24,230 --> 00:17:27,830
and that the woman was as pretty as a celebrity.

241
00:17:27,830 --> 00:17:31,800
A tall man with round eyes and a woman as pretty as a celebrity.

242
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,370
And they're among  the people who were working overtime yesterday.

243
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:36,150
Yoon Seo!

244
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:43,470
It's not me and Mr. Lawyer!

245
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,690
It seriously isn't us!

246
00:17:45,690 --> 00:17:46,710
What?

247
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:48,400
What? Ah,

248
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:53,080
I was saying that we aren't the people who kissed in the elevator.

249
00:17:53,680 --> 00:17:56,760
You're great at jokes. Of course it wasn't you!

250
00:17:56,760 --> 00:17:59,850
Yoon Seo and Jeong Rok are like cats and dogs.  It's an obvious fact that it wasn't you two.

251
00:17:59,850 --> 00:18:02,620
I was just telling you to take some coffee with you.

252
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:05,910
- Coffee.
 - Ah, yes. Coffee.

253
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,520
Anyway, it must be an office couple that is dating secretly.

254
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:15,400
They could also not be dating.

255
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,150
If a young man and young woman are trapped together in such an enclosed space,

256
00:18:18,150 --> 00:18:21,980
wouldn't romance appear even if they don't have feelings for each other?

257
00:18:24,460 --> 00:18:29,110
Ex-excuse me! People are trapped in here! Please save us!

258
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,970
What the hell? What the hell?

259
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:33,620
Just what kind of situation is...?

260
00:18:33,620 --> 00:18:36,370
This is squandering my valuable time.

261
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:40,220
Don't you think that there's not enough oxygen in here?

262
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:42,660
My breathing keeps...

263
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:44,820
Do you only breathe through your mouth?

264
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,760
You're right.

265
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,790
I must have misunderstood.

266
00:18:50,790 --> 00:18:53,360
Anyhow, why did it have to be with Lawyer Choi?

267
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,160
What are you saying? I'm the one who feels so wronged that I'm stuck in here

268
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:00,600
with you who falls in love so quickly instead of Yoon Seo, Lawyer Dan.

269
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:03,910
Just in case, just because we're in an enclosed area like this,

270
00:19:03,910 --> 00:19:07,440
it doesn't mean you can fall in love with me or anything like that.

271
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,950
Do you really have to purposely make such an ugly face?

272
00:19:14,130 --> 00:19:16,130
Even if you were to stay still, nothing like that would ever happen!

273
00:19:16,130 --> 00:19:17,620
Nothing like that would ever happen for me, either!

274
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:19,720
- Even more so for me!
 - Even more and more so for me!!!

275
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:22,620
It's even more and more and more so for me!!!

276
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,580
Get off me!

277
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:33,040
Are you okay?

278
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:41,170
- You checked it, right?
 - Yes, I did.

279
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:47,800
- And, put Jeong Ji Won's three natural food restaurants.. 
  - Yes

280
00:19:47,800 --> 00:19:50,420
and the two franchise stores as subjects of the search and seizure warrant.

281
00:19:50,420 --> 00:19:53,320
- Yes, sir.
 - Let's take a ten minute break.

282
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:57,060
I'll buy some coffee. What do you want to drink?

283
00:19:57,060 --> 00:19:58,310
I'll go with you.

284
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,170
Forget it. I'll go by myself. I've got some things to think about, too.

285
00:20:01,170 --> 00:20:05,330
Okay. Then I want an Americano.

286
00:20:06,980 --> 00:20:10,300
Oh, did you hear about the trial last time?

287
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:14,080
Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum creamed Attorney Kwon Jong Rok.

288
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:16,750
Even if she's like that, they're friends. Isn't it too much for her to be going that far?

289
00:20:16,750 --> 00:20:19,790
She must really have no heart.

290
00:20:21,330 --> 00:20:24,200
Oh, and this is another rumor, but

291
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:28,270
they said that Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum made a deal that she would be sent to whatever position she wanted

292
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:31,240
if she handled this case well.

293
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:34,730
I know that she's always been ambitious, but don't you think she's really amazing?

294
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:36,440
You should stop there.

295
00:20:36,440 --> 00:20:38,840
I don't want to hear anything else.

296
00:20:38,840 --> 00:20:41,270
Why? Things are already over between you two.

297
00:20:41,270 --> 00:20:43,920
Why are you deciding whether everything is over or not?

298
00:20:53,090 --> 00:20:55,980
- Please give me one latte and one Americano.
 - Okay.

299
00:20:59,190 --> 00:21:04,830
♫  Just because I don't need you  ♫

300
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:09,320
♫  You'll be wondering  ♫

301
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,540
Please give me this, as well.

302
00:21:19,230 --> 00:21:21,960
- What's with this?
 - I thought that you might need something sweet.

303
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,790
I'm busy.

304
00:21:23,790 --> 00:21:26,500
You look busy, even if you don't say it.

305
00:21:30,370 --> 00:21:33,770
Is that the autopsy report? Goodness, look at you.

306
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,720
You want to look at something that horrifying at a place like this?

307
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:41,040
Do you have something to say to me?

308
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:45,420
I'm telling you to eat while you're working, even if you are busy.

309
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:46,690
Does that have anything to do with you?

310
00:21:46,690 --> 00:21:49,650
It does. If you get sick,

311
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:52,310
my heart will feel uneasy.

312
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:59,250
I'll head out. You get going too. It seems like someone is waiting for her coffee.

313
00:22:12,580 --> 00:22:15,370
Ms. Prosecutor, this is the document you asked for earlier.

314
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:17,060
Thank you.

315
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:22,330
The autopsy report and the appraisal statement both work in our favor, don't they?

316
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:27,090
The defense attorney's side hasn't been making any particular moves, so I don't think they have any bright ideas.

317
00:22:27,090 --> 00:22:31,170
I guess it will be hard for them to get a ruling of self-defense, don't you think?

318
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:33,850
But still, it's too soon to jump to a conclusion.

319
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:51,460
I'll be back. Please leave a memo if there is an important call.

320
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:54,950
Yes, I will. But where are you going?

321
00:22:54,950 --> 00:22:57,350
Are you going to meet with a client?

322
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,370
I'm going to Im Yoon Hui's house.

323
00:22:59,370 --> 00:23:04,090
Im Yoon Hui's house? You mean the murder crime scene?

324
00:23:04,090 --> 00:23:07,960
Yes. There are some things that are difficult to comprehend  by looking only at the records.

325
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:12,290
I should go see them personally and see if the report is valid.

326
00:23:12,820 --> 00:23:15,680
I guess lawyers go around and work hands-on too.

327
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:18,050
It's an attorney's job to look for a chance  to impeach the evidence submitted by the prosecutor

328
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:21,620
through another piece of evidence.

329
00:23:21,620 --> 00:23:26,170
There's a saying, "If the records cannot answer you, the site can."

330
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,260
Then, I also will come with you—

331
00:23:27,260 --> 00:23:30,380
No, you can't. You don't need to look at such a horrible site.

332
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,150
But still. Who knows?

333
00:23:33,150 --> 00:23:36,900
I may be able to see something that you can't.

334
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:42,020
I've been studying a lot, too.

335
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:49,420
I want to help you in some way.

336
00:23:50,170 --> 00:23:52,560
Can't I come along?

337
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,060
Please?

338
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:21,030
So, this is...

339
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:24,130
Yes. It's Im Yoon Hui's house.

340
00:24:25,510 --> 00:24:28,000
Are you sure you'll be okay?

341
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:33,850
Of course. I once had a detective role.

342
00:24:33,850 --> 00:24:35,450
This kind of scene is familiar.

343
00:24:35,450 --> 00:24:38,500
Dramas and reality are very different.

344
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:41,300
Follow carefully right behind me.

345
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,620
Please watch your step.

346
00:25:21,170 --> 00:25:25,010
That's the bloodstains from the day of the murder, right?

347
00:25:25,010 --> 00:25:26,350
Yes.

348
00:25:27,740 --> 00:25:29,390
They say there is splattering.

349
00:25:29,390 --> 00:25:31,860
Spattering?

350
00:25:32,490 --> 00:25:35,420
When you stab someone and take the knife out,

351
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:38,370
the blood splatters in the air.

352
00:25:38,370 --> 00:25:43,520
We can analyze the stains and roughly estimate the locations of the perpetrator and the victim.

353
00:25:47,730 --> 00:25:49,560
Kim Hyeong Tae was

354
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,490
standing when he got stabbed.

355
00:25:51,490 --> 00:25:57,130
What do you mean by that?

356
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:59,660
If she said she was being assaulted and stabbed him by accident,

357
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,760
she would've been ordinarily positioned lower than the other person.

358
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:05,860
But Kim Hyeong Tae got attacked from the front while he was standing up

359
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:11,210
and based on this, the prosecutor might argue that she intended to murder him.

360
00:26:11,210 --> 00:26:12,720
Ah...

361
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,720
Let's look around a little more.

362
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,260
Okay.

363
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:29,080
Mr. Lawyer! Are you okay?

364
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,410
Yes, I'm fine.

365
00:26:31,410 --> 00:26:33,640
Call the police for me.

366
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:04,120
Who are you?!

367
00:27:12,520 --> 00:27:14,390
Are you okay, with your injury?

368
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:15,790
Should I give you a ride to the emergency room?

369
00:27:15,790 --> 00:27:19,560
I'm okay. I'll write the victim's statement first.

370
00:27:29,390 --> 00:27:30,840
Ms. Oh Jin Sim, are you okay?

371
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:33,250
What about you? Your wound...

372
00:27:33,250 --> 00:27:37,800
Oh, goodness. It's still bleeding. What should we do?

373
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,520
Hold on.

374
00:27:47,490 --> 00:27:50,460
Look at me, Ms. Oh Jin Sim. I'm okay.

375
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:54,970
But still... Your blood. Hurry and go to hospital.

376
00:27:54,970 --> 00:27:57,560
I can't go now. I have to write a report.

377
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,580
Is that important now? When you are hurt?

378
00:28:00,580 --> 00:28:03,800
Hold on. My handkerchief.

379
00:28:15,890 --> 00:28:19,910
I think you are startled. I think you should go home and take some rest.

380
00:28:19,910 --> 00:28:20,980
I will drive you home so—

381
00:28:20,980 --> 00:28:25,890
No, I will go home on my own. So, you...

382
00:28:25,890 --> 00:28:29,780
Hurry and go write a report and go to the hospital.

383
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:37,820
 Daeseung Supermarket 

384
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:39,960
I will call you later.

385
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:41,630
Alright.

386
00:28:41,630 --> 00:28:44,120
Please take care of her, Mr. Driver.

387
00:28:59,030 --> 00:29:01,500
Pardon? An intruder?

388
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:03,800
Who's the victim?

389
00:29:03,800 --> 00:29:05,470
Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok?

390
00:29:05,470 --> 00:29:08,260
Okay, I'm coming.

391
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:09,970
 Dongboo Police Station 

392
00:29:12,050 --> 00:29:13,830
Oh, you are here.

393
00:29:13,830 --> 00:29:16,500
Oh, my. You were seriously injured.

394
00:29:16,500 --> 00:29:17,890
Are you okay?

395
00:29:17,890 --> 00:29:19,460
Yes, I'm okay.

396
00:29:19,460 --> 00:29:22,260
More than that... What did he say?

397
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:25,660
Well, he's a resident here, named Park Soo Myeong.

398
00:29:25,660 --> 00:29:28,470
He was passing by and heard something from inside the empty house.

399
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:32,820
He said that he went inside because he thought it was a thief. He's "crime prevention staff" in this neighborhood.

400
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:34,070
Do you know him?

401
00:29:34,070 --> 00:29:37,210
His mother owns a meat market. He delivers meats.

402
00:29:37,210 --> 00:29:38,820
Can I talk to him, just the two of us?

403
00:29:38,820 --> 00:29:41,850
Of course, go ahead.

404
00:29:51,710 --> 00:29:54,010
Mr. Park Soo Myeong?

405
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:56,320
Very sick.

406
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:57,760
Excuse me?

407
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,320
Your head is bleeding.

408
00:30:04,330 --> 00:30:06,060
I'm okay.

409
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:09,090
Well, I have a few things to ask you.

410
00:30:09,090 --> 00:30:11,400
Go ahead, ask me.

411
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:13,820
You thought I was a thief.

412
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:18,090
Do you know Im Yoon Hui?

413
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:25,650
Besides today, have you ever been to that house before?

414
00:30:25,650 --> 00:30:27,320
Noona...

415
00:30:29,190 --> 00:30:31,800
Noona told me not to say it.

416
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:36,860
She told you not to say what?

417
00:30:38,050 --> 00:30:42,060
By chance, did you go to that house on the day of the incident?

418
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:44,430
Did you see something or someone—

419
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,490
Oh, are you Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum?

420
00:30:45,490 --> 00:30:46,890
Yes.

421
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:49,590
I called her since she's the prosecutor in charge.

422
00:30:54,880 --> 00:30:57,230
Are you okay?

423
00:30:57,230 --> 00:30:59,590
I'm okay. It's nothing.

424
00:31:01,950 --> 00:31:03,200
This is him?

425
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,720
The one who came to the crime site.

426
00:31:10,400 --> 00:31:14,170
 POLICE 

427
00:31:16,270 --> 00:31:19,190
Are you sure it's okay to let him go like this?

428
00:31:19,190 --> 00:31:22,000
Since he did it due to a misunderstanding.

429
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,790
Thank you for letting him go.

430
00:31:23,790 --> 00:31:25,830
Soo Myeong, say thank you.

431
00:31:25,830 --> 00:31:27,800
Thank you.

432
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,400
I'm sorry.

433
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,390
Bye, then.

434
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:57,580
Manager, this is Yoo Yeo Reum.

435
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:00,950
I'd like you to look up a person for me.

436
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:04,360
A man named Park Soo Myeong. He works at a meat market in Im Yoon Hui's neighborhorhood.

437
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,000
You know, Park Soo Myeong...

438
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:08,900
I'd like you to investigate where he was on the day of the incident.

439
00:32:08,900 --> 00:32:10,760
Yes.

440
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,930
Yes, yes. Thank you, Mr. Manager.

441
00:32:16,600 --> 00:32:19,520
What are you doing here, Ms. Oh Jin Sim? You took a taxi and left before —

442
00:32:19,520 --> 00:32:23,890
I was too worried to leave. That's why I came back.

443
00:32:23,890 --> 00:32:25,990
Is everything over?

444
00:32:25,990 --> 00:32:29,760
Who was that guy? Why in the world did he do that?

445
00:32:30,590 --> 00:32:32,080
No.

446
00:32:32,080 --> 00:32:34,520
Let's go to the hospital first.

447
00:32:35,860 --> 00:32:38,660
No, there is no need. It stopped bleeding. I'm fine.

448
00:32:38,660 --> 00:32:42,010
That's something for a doctor to decide.

449
00:32:42,010 --> 00:32:43,970
Hurry up. Come on.

450
00:32:43,970 --> 00:32:46,090
Get in.

451
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:56,830
There is no need to worry.

452
00:32:56,830 --> 00:32:59,470
The test result came out. It's a minor concussion.

453
00:32:59,470 --> 00:33:02,200
But still, it will be better if you can take it easy for a while.

454
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:05,670
Okay. Thank you.

455
00:33:08,970 --> 00:33:11,270
That's a relief, seriously.

456
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:15,260
I was so worried there might be a problem.

457
00:33:16,170 --> 00:33:18,970
I can now breathe properly.

458
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:36,440
You really didn't have to drive me home.

459
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:40,680
You are not in good condition.

460
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:42,500
It's okay.

461
00:33:42,500 --> 00:33:46,000
You came to the hospital with me.

462
00:33:47,740 --> 00:33:50,930
I honestly went, not because of you, but

463
00:33:50,930 --> 00:33:53,850
because of me.

464
00:33:56,970 --> 00:34:02,120
Earlier, I kept feeling bad for leaving you alone back there.

465
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,820
I, too,

466
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:10,130
felt uneasy sending you by yourself.

467
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:13,070
That's why I drove you home.

468
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,940
So you don't need to feel sorry.

469
00:34:19,650 --> 00:34:23,020
You must have been very startled today. Hurry inside and get some good rest.

470
00:34:23,020 --> 00:34:26,780
Don't worry about me.  You  take a good rest, please.

471
00:34:26,780 --> 00:34:30,240
Don't think about work for today.

472
00:34:31,190 --> 00:34:33,180
Alright?

473
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:36,650
Alright, I got it.

474
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:39,120
Promise me. 
 ♫   Full of something I don't know  ♫

475
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:45,500
Come on. Promise me. 
♫   Honestly it's difficult for me umm  ♫

476
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:48,950
♫  Whether timing is what it is or  ♫

477
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:53,380
♫  Why did it get twisted as it pleased?  ♫

478
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:58,610
♫  My slow moving heart  ♫

479
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:03,780
♫  Searched for you with all my might  ♫

480
00:35:03,780 --> 00:35:06,810
♫  Within a footstep's reach  ♫

481
00:35:06,810 --> 00:35:11,910
Since you've made a promise, you have to keep it. 
 ♫  I'm here.  Are you waiting for something?  ♫

482
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:12,920
Okay.

483
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:21,560
♫  Ooh love love is. What is it? What is love?  ♫

484
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:29,520
♫  Ooh love. What should I do?  What if love?  ♫

485
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:31,630
♫  Probably for me it's you  ♫

486
00:35:31,630 --> 00:35:35,280
♫  one one one my one  ♫

487
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,950
♫  the only one one one you are  ♫

488
00:35:39,950 --> 00:35:44,700
♫  If this is love love love if love  ♫

489
00:35:44,700 --> 00:35:51,300
♫  What should I do? What should I do? What if this is the love?  ♫

490
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,310
You are late. You must be busy preparing for the second hearing.

491
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:06,310
Yeah.

492
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:10,800
By the way, you two... Please don't take the same case again.

493
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:13,030
It feels like I'm walking on thin ice every day.

494
00:36:13,030 --> 00:36:16,360
Okay.  I will go against you next time then.

495
00:36:16,360 --> 00:36:18,250
This punk.

496
00:36:20,780 --> 00:36:23,320
What is it? You got hurt?

497
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,300
What happened? Who did it?

498
00:36:27,300 --> 00:36:29,590
It's nothing.

499
00:36:45,990 --> 00:36:49,170
 Did you know Im Yoon Hui? 

500
00:36:51,370 --> 00:36:55,170
 Besides today, have you ever been to that house before? 

501
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,220
 Noona... 

502
00:36:58,850 --> 00:37:02,120
 Noona told me not to say it. 

503
00:37:07,370 --> 00:37:08,920
He must be a witness.

504
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:15,100
If he said Noona told him not to say it, that must mean that he knows something or saw something.

505
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:18,480
Then, he will likely be a witness, right?

506
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:22,190
I've asked the office manager to look up his acquaintances.

507
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:25,370
We're stepping into uncharted territory.

508
00:37:25,370 --> 00:37:28,750
By the way, Lawyer Kwon, you should be careful.

509
00:37:28,750 --> 00:37:31,830
I appreciate you working hard but you can't get hurt.

510
00:37:31,830 --> 00:37:36,400
Exactly. I really thought he was going to die yesterday.

511
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:38,410
Why would I die?

512
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,160
I'm good with fights. Don't worry.

513
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:45,700
How can I not be worried? You got knocked over with a single blow yesterday!

514
00:37:45,700 --> 00:37:49,890
Because you're wrong, you were put to shame.  If he hit you properly, you would be totally ...

515
00:37:49,890 --> 00:37:53,630
I got hit on the right spot yesterday, though.

516
00:37:53,630 --> 00:37:58,530
Ms. Yoon Seo, he's weaker than he seems.

517
00:37:58,530 --> 00:38:00,400
As for me, back in the day,

518
00:38:00,400 --> 00:38:05,230
while working on an illegal drug smuggling case, I got attacked by a gang.

519
00:38:05,230 --> 00:38:07,300
- A gang?
 - Yes.

520
00:38:07,300 --> 00:38:09,470
Two gangs

521
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,490
I filed one of the lawsuits when two gangs sued each otherl, each blaming the other.

522
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:17,800
At the time, by virtue of my thoroughness and impartiality, we won the case.

523
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:22,720
The other gang that lost held a grudge.. A total of 14...  Fourteen?  Fifteen, 16...

524
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:28,240
Seventeen men attacked me at once but I was able to fight them all with my bare hands.

525
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:31,220
- Do you know what my secret was?
 - What was it?

526
00:38:31,220 --> 00:38:33,880
- Guts!
 - Guts?
 - Yeah.

527
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:37,920
It was because of my guts! I never get scared no matter what kind of situation I'm in.

528
00:38:37,970 --> 00:38:39,270
But...

529
00:38:39,270 --> 00:38:45,260
Our Lawyer Kwon might be smart but he doesn't have any guts whatsoever.

530
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:50,830
Let's use words. Words, words.

531
00:38:50,830 --> 00:38:53,140
- Gosh.
 - There was a hair on your clothes.

532
00:38:53,140 --> 00:38:55,260
A strand of hair.

533
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:02,500
Lawyer Kwon doesn't have

534
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,810
guts but he has a really good eye, right?

535
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:08,290
How did he see that?

536
00:39:08,360 --> 00:39:10,050
Impressive.

537
00:39:11,610 --> 00:39:14,540
You are not scared. I guess he doesn't respond to anything.

538
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:17,800
Oh, gosh.

539
00:39:17,800 --> 00:39:20,620
That guy... How did he see that (hair)?

540
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,030
Go on out.

541
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:30,800
 Daesang Butcher Shop 

542
00:39:30,810 --> 00:39:34,010
- You know the beauty shop I go to, right? 
 - Yes.

543
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:36,630
Yes.  Then I'll be back.

544
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:39,540
- Hello, Grandpa.
 - Hey.

545
00:39:39,540 --> 00:39:42,190
- Soo Myeong, you must be going out for a delivery. 
 - Yes!

546
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:45,270
- I will be back!
 -  Alright, alright.

547
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:52,990
Excuse me.

548
00:39:52,990 --> 00:39:54,610
You are working hard on such a freezing day.

549
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,340
By the way,

550
00:39:56,340 --> 00:40:00,610
I think you know the son of the meat market well.

551
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:04,340
I know him well, but what is it?

552
00:40:10,130 --> 00:40:13,630
Soo Myeong had a crush on that woman.

553
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:16,620
So he'd follow her around all the time.

554
00:40:16,620 --> 00:40:19,660
So you must have seen them together often, right?

555
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:21,430
Of course.

556
00:40:21,430 --> 00:40:25,480
I go around every single alley in this neighborhood.

557
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:27,490
Huh? Three to four times a day!

558
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:32,740
Did you perhaps see them together on the day of the incident, as well?

559
00:40:32,740 --> 00:40:34,370
Sorry?

560
00:40:34,370 --> 00:40:37,750
You said that Mr. Park Soo Myeong went to Im Yoon Hui's house that night?

561
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:40,320
He said that he saw it clearly.

562
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:51,760
 Where are you going this late? 

563
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:54,220
 I'm out for a delivery. 

564
00:40:54,220 --> 00:40:58,990
 I should get going. Noona Yoon Hui must be waiting for me. 

565
00:40:58,990 --> 00:41:01,180
 Noona is pretty. 

566
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:05,340
 He does like her so much! 

567
00:41:08,190 --> 00:41:12,280
Mr. Park Soo Myeong likes Ms. Im Yoon Hui.

568
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:17,330
Then isn't it possible that he's pretending like he didn't see the scene of the incident even though he did?

569
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:20,550
I think he's a witness for sure.

570
00:41:20,550 --> 00:41:23,180
He might not be a witness.

571
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:28,190
If he's not a witness, then...

572
00:41:35,290 --> 00:41:38,110
Were you close to Ms. Im Yoon Hui?

573
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:41,100
Noona is a good person.

574
00:41:41,100 --> 00:41:46,180
You know that Ms. Im Yoon Hui  killed her husband, right?

575
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,250
I have to go out for a delivery!

576
00:41:48,250 --> 00:41:51,210
Mom said there are many orders today.

577
00:41:51,210 --> 00:41:53,740
Did you perhaps go to Ms. Im Yoon Hui's house on the day of the incident?

578
00:41:53,740 --> 00:41:55,120
Did you witness the crime scene or—

579
00:41:55,120 --> 00:41:59,150
Two kilos of ox tail to Mr. Jin Soo, 3kg of shoulder to Myeong Jin.

580
00:41:59,150 --> 00:42:03,860
One kilo of stew meat to Gyeok Soo, and... and...

581
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,790
Where else? My mom told me.

582
00:42:06,790 --> 00:42:08,750
Where else?

583
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:15,890
It's so frustrating that he's not answering your questions.

584
00:42:15,890 --> 00:42:19,620
- I thought he might be a witness at first. 
 - Even if he is a witness,

585
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:23,300
he may not be of any help to us.

586
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:27,910
If Park Soo Myeong talks about the circumstances or the severity of Im Yoon Hui getting beat

587
00:42:27,910 --> 00:42:32,940
on her side at the trial, that would be disadvantageous to us.

588
00:42:32,940 --> 00:42:36,310
I guess so. I did some research and

589
00:42:36,310 --> 00:42:39,210
it seemed like Im Yoon Hui and Park Soo Myeong have been quite close.

590
00:42:39,210 --> 00:42:41,790
Let's stop here and let Park Soo Myeong go.

591
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:46,470
Oh? Are you going somewhere?

592
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:49,510
Yes. I have some things to ask Ms. Im Yoon Hui.

593
00:42:49,510 --> 00:42:51,770
Oh! Then...

594
00:42:55,660 --> 00:42:59,330
This. Please have this before you go.

595
00:42:59,330 --> 00:43:02,270
- What's this?
 - What do you mean what? It's red ginseng.

596
00:43:02,270 --> 00:43:04,370
Please drink up. Go on.

597
00:43:04,370 --> 00:43:06,740
- In front of me.
 - Okay.

598
00:43:13,430 --> 00:43:19,210
How is it? Do you feel better? I brought it just for you.

599
00:43:19,210 --> 00:43:22,230
Since you are weaker than you seem to be.

600
00:43:22,230 --> 00:43:27,230
What do you mean weak? I guess you didn't see it well because you were in shock yesterday.

601
00:43:27,230 --> 00:43:30,740
I took a really good hit, right at the spot.

602
00:43:30,740 --> 00:43:33,080
An average person would have been out for a couple of hours there and then,

603
00:43:33,080 --> 00:43:36,220
but I was able to get up immediately and go after the suspect because I am me.

604
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:40,480
If you keep spreading rumors that I'm weak and I almost died, you might be punished for defamation.

605
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:43,990
You are going to punish me? Me?

606
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:48,000
I called 112 (the police) yesterday, took you to the hospital,

607
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,450
and even gave you the red ginseng extract.

608
00:43:50,450 --> 00:43:53,220
Wow... You're seriously too much.

609
00:43:53,220 --> 00:43:56,250
No, well... I wasn't going to actually punish you.

610
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:01,260
I'm just saying it could get you into trouble so please watch your words.

611
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:04,620
I got it. Anyway, be careful.

612
00:44:04,620 --> 00:44:07,090
Yes. Then.

613
00:44:13,290 --> 00:44:15,780
Nothing's going to happen today, right?

614
00:44:15,780 --> 00:44:18,970
I'm so anxious.

615
00:44:27,570 --> 00:44:30,610
Can I ask you one thing?

616
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:36,540
On the day of the incident, you had been seriously injured which would require nine weeks to heal.

617
00:44:37,540 --> 00:44:41,020
But how could you stab your husband twice and kill him

618
00:44:41,020 --> 00:44:44,290
when he's twice your size?

619
00:44:44,950 --> 00:44:48,310
I was full of thoughts that I had to survive somehow.

620
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:52,480
I thought that was the only way to end it.

621
00:44:54,140 --> 00:44:56,640
It takes more than just thoughts.

622
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:58,300
Unlike the movies or dramas we watch, organs and bones get in the way,

623
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:01,900
making it even harder for a knife to go through.

624
00:45:01,930 --> 00:45:07,300
So it's typical for the people that stab for the first time to get their hands hurt.

625
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:16,190
By chance, do you know a man named Park Soo Myeong?

626
00:45:17,260 --> 00:45:19,080
Yes.

627
00:45:19,880 --> 00:45:22,080
He works at the meat market.

628
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,300
I heard that you were quite intimate.

629
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,010
- Who said that?
 - Most of your neighbors said that.

630
00:45:28,010 --> 00:45:30,970
What nonsense, with someone like that?

631
00:45:38,390 --> 00:45:41,700
Today is the second day of Im Yoon Hui's trial, right?

632
00:45:41,700 --> 00:45:44,630
Yes. I'm so nervous.

633
00:45:44,630 --> 00:45:47,700
I'm very nervous too.

634
00:45:47,700 --> 00:45:51,560
We should be able to get the atmosphere favorable to us.

635
00:45:51,560 --> 00:45:56,410
Somehow I'm even more nervous than the time I was about to hold my first love's hand.

636
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:59,980
- Oh, Lawyer Kwon is here.
 - Oh, you are here!

637
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:05,110
You can do it well, right? You have a hidden card to flip the table?

638
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:08,120
Let's have a talk, Mr. Manager.

639
00:46:12,770 --> 00:46:16,050
His expression seems like he has something at least.

640
00:46:16,050 --> 00:46:20,030
I guess he doesn't have manners but he does have an ace up his sleeve.

641
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,360
Well, were you able to persuade Mr. Park Soo Myeong to attend the trial?

642
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:28,310
He'd adamantly refused every single time I went to talk to him.

643
00:46:28,310 --> 00:46:33,800
It would be hard but you need to bring him to the trial today, by any means necessary. Please, I ask of you.

644
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:39,770
I will give it a try.

645
00:46:40,370 --> 00:46:45,550
I will go meet him with Mr. Manager and try to persuade him.

646
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:56,120
- I will wait for you in the lobby.
 - Okay.

647
00:47:05,410 --> 00:47:07,000
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

648
00:47:07,780 --> 00:47:11,210
I think you should not come to the trial today.

649
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:14,130
Sorry? Why not?

650
00:47:14,130 --> 00:47:19,120
There will be more journalists than the last time. It would be too risky.

651
00:47:20,030 --> 00:47:23,380
I got it. Then I will be back.

652
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,840
Everything will go well today, Mr. Lawyer.

653
00:47:36,820 --> 00:47:41,810
The trial of Ms. Im who was charged with murdering her husband who was a domestic abuser proceeds again today.

654
00:47:41,810 --> 00:47:46,360
It seems an issue will be whether it was justifiable self defense or premeditated to collect insurance.

655
00:47:46,360 --> 00:47:49,490
When Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum of Department 3 of the Seoul Central District  Criminal Department 3

656
00:47:49,490 --> 00:47:52,610
revealed further evidence in light of the cirumstances ...

657
00:47:52,610 --> 00:47:57,300
she stated she is confident she can  prove that Ms Im committed premeditated murder.

658
00:47:57,300 --> 00:47:59,870
Noona!

659
00:48:02,560 --> 00:48:04,820
Noona.

660
00:48:08,560 --> 00:48:12,650
Soo Myeong, where are you going? You have to go on a delivery!

661
00:48:13,560 --> 00:48:16,360
Park Soo Myeong, shall we talk for a moment?

662
00:48:16,360 --> 00:48:20,940
I'm not going! I'm not going. I'm not! I told you I wasn't going!

663
00:48:22,230 --> 00:48:24,400
I will go.

664
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:30,670
Noona told me not to say anything. She told me not to say it.

665
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:34,170
Noona said that I shouldn't say it.

666
00:48:41,710 --> 00:48:44,290
Mr. Park Soo Myeong.

667
00:48:45,010 --> 00:48:47,560
Do you remember me?

668
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:54,060
You would have seen me at Im Yoon Hui's house that time.

669
00:48:54,650 --> 00:48:58,790
I was beside the lawyer

670
00:48:58,790 --> 00:49:01,300
that you attacked.

671
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,400
Actually, I was really angry at that time.

672
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,430
The person that you hit

673
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:12,990
is the person that I like, you see.

674
00:49:12,990 --> 00:49:18,320
Because the person I like got hurt, I was really upset.

675
00:49:19,450 --> 00:49:23,220
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So sorry.

676
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:29,000
Soo Myeong, you know how I feel.

677
00:49:29,860 --> 00:49:33,930
You hate it when the person that you like is hurting or suffering.

678
00:49:33,930 --> 00:49:37,180
I hate it. I hate it!

679
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:43,320
I hate it. I don't like Noona Yoon Hui hurting or suffering!

680
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,270
But if you stay like this and don't say anything,

681
00:49:49,270 --> 00:49:53,490
Im Yoon Hui might be in more pain or suffer more.

682
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:58,790
You have to tell the truth, no matter what that is.

683
00:49:58,790 --> 00:50:03,980
If you don't do it today, you may not be able to see your noona for a long time.

684
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:13,720
Acknowledge that it was self-defense!

685
00:50:13,720 --> 00:50:15,780
Acknowledge it! Acknowledge it!

686
00:50:15,780 --> 00:50:17,600
As a senior researcher for the National Institute of Science,

687
00:50:17,600 --> 00:50:20,520
did you personally see and analyze the blood splatter at the scene of the crime?

688
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,390
Yes, that's correct.

689
00:50:21,390 --> 00:50:27,540
Defendant Im Yoon Hui said she accidentally stabbed him when she was struggling with him.

690
00:50:27,540 --> 00:50:30,560
Is the analysis of the blood splatter consistent with her assertion?

691
00:50:30,560 --> 00:50:33,600
It is not consistent. The blood splatter of this case

692
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:39,400
when she stabbed him with all her might, on  the front of the victim was a bloodstain that would have appeared.

693
00:50:45,100 --> 00:50:47,330
That is all.

694
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:52,920
- Defendant, do you have a cross examination?
 - Yes.

695
00:50:59,020 --> 00:51:02,600
Mr. Witness, how much can you discover from a blood spatter analysis?

696
00:51:02,600 --> 00:51:06,910
You can figure out what happened at the site of the incident.

697
00:51:06,910 --> 00:51:09,950
Did you find and blood splatter on the defendant Im Yoon Hui's clothing

698
00:51:09,950 --> 00:51:13,310
which would have occurred when she stabbed the front of the victim?

699
00:51:14,170 --> 00:51:16,130
Well, that's not the case, but—

700
00:51:16,130 --> 00:51:20,430
Isn't it correct that no blood splatter was found on the defendant's clothing?

701
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,860
- Yes.
 - Those words mean that there is a possibility that Im Yoon Hui is not the culprit, correct?

702
00:51:26,860 --> 00:51:30,270
I have an objection! That is a leading question.

703
00:51:31,190 --> 00:51:33,160
Objection overruled.

704
00:51:33,160 --> 00:51:35,980
Witness, please answer him.

705
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:41,960
When you look at the blood spatter analysis, you can not rule that possibility out.

706
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,890
Noona.  Noona.

707
00:51:56,700 --> 00:52:00,190
Your Honor, I'd like to call a rebuttal witness.

708
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:06,170
A rebuttal witness?  This is a request which was not discussed during pre-trial.   What is your proffer of proof?

709
00:52:06,170 --> 00:52:08,860
Park Soo Myeong, whom I requested as an additional witness,

710
00:52:08,860 --> 00:52:12,180
has had a long-standing close relationship with the defendant, Im Yoon Hui.

711
00:52:12,180 --> 00:52:16,530
He also visited the crime scene the day the incident occurred.

712
00:52:16,530 --> 00:52:20,510
He was excluded from the police investigation, but he could be the sole witness

713
00:52:20,510 --> 00:52:24,320
or even another suspect.

714
00:52:24,320 --> 00:52:26,720
Please allow him to take the stand.

715
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:32,680
 Witness Stand 

716
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:36,150
Mr. Witness, please do one thing before the questioning.

717
00:52:36,150 --> 00:52:39,560
Will you write your name?

718
00:52:46,240 --> 00:52:52,230
Do you use your right hand for normal activities such as writing or eating?

719
00:52:52,230 --> 00:52:53,980
Yes.

720
00:52:53,980 --> 00:52:59,610
- You currently live alone with your mother, who runs a butcher shop. Correct?
 - Yes.

721
00:52:59,610 --> 00:53:05,440
You're the person who delivers the meat.  Your mother  does all the cutting and trimming of the meat.

722
00:53:05,440 --> 00:53:07,580
- Is that correct?
 - Yes.

723
00:53:07,580 --> 00:53:13,300
To state it again, there is nothing that you use a knife for, right?

724
00:53:15,950 --> 00:53:18,470
- Yes.
- However...

725
00:53:19,110 --> 00:53:24,310
When exactly did you get that scar on your thumb?

726
00:53:28,340 --> 00:53:31,450
On the day and time of the crime,

727
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:35,840
- you went to Im Yoon Hui's house for a delivery. Is that correct? 
 - Yes.

728
00:53:35,840 --> 00:53:39,630
According to your medical records which I obtained,

729
00:53:39,630 --> 00:53:43,820
on the day that the incident occurred, you went to the emergency room and received stitches

730
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,990
for a three-centimeter wound on your right thumb.

731
00:53:45,990 --> 00:53:49,420
We request the admission of the witness' medical records as evidence.

732
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:54,680
Usually, when a normal person stabs someone with a knife, the knife doesn't go in well.

733
00:53:54,680 --> 00:53:58,030
There are many cases where their thumbs get cut.

734
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:02,840
Is this a simple coincidence?

735
00:54:02,840 --> 00:54:07,250
Your Honor, the police only believed Im Yoon Hui's confession

736
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:10,430
and did not investigate anything about Park Soo Myeong at all.

737
00:54:10,430 --> 00:54:15,920
Perhaps the police just wanted to quickly wrap up the case that was becoming a social issue from the beginning.

738
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:19,470
They neglected to find out the truth behind the incident.

739
00:54:24,650 --> 00:54:26,630
I'm going to ask you.

740
00:54:27,530 --> 00:54:32,000
Who killed Kim Hyeong Tae that day?

741
00:54:33,490 --> 00:54:35,030
Objection, Judge.

742
00:54:35,030 --> 00:54:40,120
At the crime scene, there was no evidence, not a single trace of fingerprints or blood of the witness.

743
00:54:40,120 --> 00:54:42,480
Right now, without any evidence,

744
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,420
the attorney is misleading you and the jury.

745
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,130
That's out of his mere imagination.

746
00:54:47,130 --> 00:54:49,090
No, that's not it.

747
00:54:49,090 --> 00:54:53,790
Your Honor,  to prove Defendant Im Yoon Hui guilty, the only evidence provided by the prosecutors

748
00:54:53,790 --> 00:54:56,430
were the defendant's confession and the autopsy report.

749
00:54:56,430 --> 00:55:00,460
But even the autopsy report doesn't match the defendant's confession.

750
00:55:00,460 --> 00:55:05,000
Like the prosecutor argued, she's been in a serious condition that would take about 9 weeks to heal.

751
00:55:05,000 --> 00:55:08,670
It doesn't make sense she was able to stab her husband right in vital spots twice. It's impossible.

752
00:55:09,630 --> 00:55:12,760
Park Soo Myeong went to the crime scene that day and

753
00:55:12,760 --> 00:55:14,860
got a cut on his thumb.

754
00:55:14,860 --> 00:55:20,050
Im Yoon Hui said she murdered him but she wasn't physically capable of doing so.

755
00:55:25,210 --> 00:55:27,230
I'm going to ask you one more time.

756
00:55:28,090 --> 00:55:30,640
The one who murdered Kim Hyeong Tae that day.

757
00:55:31,310 --> 00:55:33,020
Who is it?

758
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:39,610
The one who stabbed that person...

759
00:55:42,690 --> 00:55:44,130
The one who stabbed that person—

760
00:55:44,130 --> 00:55:45,830
Soo Myeong, don't! Don't say anything!

761
00:55:45,830 --> 00:55:47,200
Ms. Defendant, please stay calm.

762
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:51,950
Don't hit Noona! Don't hit Noona! Don't do that to her! Don't!

763
00:55:51,950 --> 00:55:54,650
I stabbed him. I stabbed him with a knife.

764
00:55:54,650 --> 00:55:58,910
I stabbed him. I stabbed him with a knife.

765
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:01,240
Soo Myeong...

766
00:56:01,240 --> 00:56:05,010
That bastard... That bastard hit her every day.

767
00:56:05,010 --> 00:56:08,380
My Noona got hit again that day, every day.

768
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:10,950
So I stabbed him.

769
00:56:10,950 --> 00:56:16,850
My Noona got hit again that day. Why? She got hit.

770
00:56:16,850 --> 00:56:20,180
She got hit again that day, too.

771
00:56:21,620 --> 00:56:24,340
 Stop... .

772
00:56:24,340 --> 00:56:25,890
 Noona... Noona. 

773
00:56:32,100 --> 00:56:36,520
 - Noona! Noona! Don't hit Noona! Don't hit her!
 - Noona?! 

774
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:39,330
 Soo Myeong, run away, please! 

775
00:56:39,330 --> 00:56:41,670
 Please! 

776
00:56:55,460 --> 00:56:59,580
I stabbed him, I did it. I stabbed him.

777
00:56:59,580 --> 00:57:01,640
My Noona got beat.

778
00:57:01,640 --> 00:57:06,170
My Noona got hit every day, every day.

779
00:57:18,430 --> 00:57:20,160
She's coming!

780
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:22,470
Did you have an affair with the suspect?

781
00:57:22,470 --> 00:57:24,930
There were only your fingerprints at the scene.

782
00:57:24,930 --> 00:57:27,050
Why did you try to conceal the crime scene?

783
00:57:27,050 --> 00:57:29,950
Why didn't you reveal that someone else killed your husband?

784
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,920
Please say a few words!

785
00:57:33,670 --> 00:57:35,880
It's no different from me killing him.

786
00:57:35,880 --> 00:57:40,020
Since I've killed him in my mind

787
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:42,360
dozens of times. No, hundreds of times already.

788
00:57:42,360 --> 00:57:45,950
 It has been revealed  that there is a real murderer who is responsible for Mr. Kim Hyeong Tae's death. 

789
00:57:45,950 --> 00:57:48,260
 Mr. Park confessed himself that he is responsible for the murder. 

790
00:57:48,260 --> 00:57:50,520
 He stated that he ended up killing him by accident. 

791
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:55,650
 The police have reported that they've found a pair of blood-stained gloves 

792
00:57:55,650 --> 00:57:59,750
 in Mr. Park's bedroom and they believe the blood stains belong to  

793
00:57:59,750 --> 00:58:02,150
 the late Kim Yeong Tae and Mr. Park. They will request a DNA analysis. 

794
00:58:03,860 --> 00:58:06,120
He's indeed our firm ace! I knew Lawyer Kwon could do it!

795
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:10,210
I know, right? I didn't even imagine that there could be a true perpetrator other than her.

796
00:58:10,210 --> 00:58:14,100
Really? You really didn't know? I already knew that.

797
00:58:14,100 --> 00:58:16,000
If you already knew, you wouldn't have just stayed put.

798
00:58:16,000 --> 00:58:19,300
With your personality, you would've bragged about it all along.

799
00:58:19,300 --> 00:58:23,420
What do you mean I'd brag? Are you done talking now?Huh?

800
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,050
We're back.

801
00:58:27,050 --> 00:58:29,140
Lawyer Kwon!

802
00:58:29,140 --> 00:58:32,850
Come here. You've worked so hard. Come.

803
00:58:32,850 --> 00:58:35,700
No, I'm going to give you a hug today.

804
00:58:35,700 --> 00:58:38,430
I love you, Kwon Jeong Rok.

805
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:41,460
We can't just let this joyous day go by without a celebration.

806
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,920
Let's have a firm dinner tonight. The first round will be Korean beef.

807
00:58:43,920 --> 00:58:46,460
The second round will be karaoke.

808
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:49,080
Okay? Okay.

809
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:52,240
- I'm sorry but let's go on another day. 
- What is it this time?

810
00:58:52,240 --> 00:58:55,830
I'm a bit tired today. I'm sorry.

811
00:58:59,290 --> 00:59:03,050
Then, we should celebrate without Lawyer Kwon.

812
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:08,180
What are you talking about? The main character won't be there.

813
00:59:08,180 --> 00:59:10,230
Have you ever seen a fan meetup without a celebrity?

814
00:59:10,230 --> 00:59:12,140
Have you ever seen a baby's first birthday party without a baby?

815
00:59:12,140 --> 00:59:14,560
Let's  get our heads on straight, alright?

816
00:59:29,320 --> 00:59:33,440
- You are getting off work on time today. It's been a while.
 - Yes, well...

817
00:59:33,440 --> 00:59:39,210
You must be so tired. Go home and get some good, good rest.

818
00:59:42,720 --> 00:59:48,310
Ms. Oh Jin Sim. Would you go have soju with me?

819
00:59:48,310 --> 00:59:49,660
Excuse me?

820
00:59:49,660 --> 00:59:52,180
 Oh Nam Gamjatang (pork stew) 

821
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:05,560
It seems like you are not really in a good mood.

822
01:00:06,990 --> 01:00:13,050
It's strange. My Mr. Lawyer usually feels really happy when he wins a case.

823
01:00:13,850 --> 01:00:16,290
Ah, perhaps...

824
01:00:16,290 --> 01:00:19,560
Is it because of Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum?

825
01:00:19,560 --> 01:00:21,640
Do you feel uneasy because she's your friend?

826
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:24,800
Yes. That too...

827
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:31,060
Ms. Im Yoon Hui confessing in place of Mr. Park Soo Myeong,

828
01:00:31,770 --> 01:00:35,240
and Mr. Park Soo Myeong committing a murder for her,

829
01:00:35,240 --> 01:00:38,050
I could understand them both so...

830
01:00:39,150 --> 01:00:42,250
It's a bit hard for me to just be happy and enjoy the day.

831
01:00:52,710 --> 01:00:54,150
Here.

832
01:01:04,910 --> 01:01:06,400
Goodness!

833
01:01:17,370 --> 01:01:21,070
- Thank you.
 - For what?

834
01:01:21,070 --> 01:01:25,590
For telling me that I'd definitely win the case, and when I got hurt,

835
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:28,340
for worrying about me the most.

836
01:01:29,130 --> 01:01:31,140
Don't mention it.

837
01:01:34,490 --> 01:01:36,690
By the way ...

838
01:01:36,690 --> 01:01:39,770
may I ask you one thing?

839
01:01:39,770 --> 01:01:42,110
You said you were tired, so

840
01:01:42,110 --> 01:01:44,830
you won't go to the firm dinner.

841
01:01:44,830 --> 01:01:48,870
But why did you ask me to drink soju with you?

842
01:01:49,910 --> 01:01:52,620
Today, I just wanted to...

843
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:57,710
I wanted to have a drink with you, just the two of us.

844
01:02:16,160 --> 01:02:18,820
It's colder than I expected.

845
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:27,350
Why are you laughing like that?

846
01:02:27,350 --> 01:02:29,280
I just remembered

847
01:02:29,280 --> 01:02:33,280
the time we went to the arboretum together.

848
01:02:33,280 --> 01:02:35,970
Then, you told me to put my hands

849
01:02:35,970 --> 01:02:38,200
in (my) pocket if my hands were cold,

850
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:42,300
but I misunderstood and put my hands in your pocket, remember?

851
01:02:42,300 --> 01:02:46,180
I was really embarrassed back then!

852
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:50,490
Because I was in a lot of dramas,

853
01:02:50,490 --> 01:02:53,320
there are times when I lose my sense of reality.

854
01:02:53,320 --> 01:02:55,860
To be honest, there was no need for you to offer your pocket

855
01:02:55,860 --> 01:02:59,460
just because my hands were cold, you know?

856
01:03:18,230 --> 01:03:20,230
I've become concerned.

857
01:03:21,740 --> 01:03:27,200
As much as you worry about me and comfort me,

858
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,030
I also want to do the same now.

859
01:03:34,910 --> 01:03:40,310
♫  Time, time is mystical  ♫

860
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:45,410
♫  You regret after it has passed. Oh, it's sad  ♫

861
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:52,630
♫  When a sweet dream wakes you up, even when it's clear  ♫

862
01:03:52,630 --> 01:03:56,630
♫  it soon fades and disappears again  ♫

863
01:03:56,630 --> 01:03:59,780
♫  La la  ♫

864
01:03:59,780 --> 01:04:05,440
♫  Here you and me now to this moment  ♫

865
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:10,630
♫  I'm trying to put and hold in a place deep in my heart  ♫

866
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:13,380
♫  The touch of one hand comfortably over another
  ♫

867
01:04:13,380 --> 01:04:19,150
 Touch Your Heart
 ~ Preview ~ 

868
01:04:19,150 --> 01:04:24,120
 I wish it was someone that could move my heart. 

869
01:04:24,120 --> 01:04:27,530
 Can't believe we are having a workshop with the universe's goddess Oh Yoon Seo. 

870
01:04:28,440 --> 01:04:31,190
 Everyone is so worried that Yoon Seo might be cold but 

871
01:04:31,190 --> 01:04:33,590
 how come you are so inconsiderate of Yoon Seo? 

872
01:04:33,590 --> 01:04:38,050
 We went to get fish cake bars for you. He was empty-handed, you know. 

873
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:41,720
 She was expecting him to make a move but he won't. 

874
01:04:41,720 --> 01:04:44,520
 - You are so mean, Mr. Lawyer!
 - She's really mad. 

875
01:04:44,520 --> 01:04:49,540
 There is no logic in love. You can't prepare everything ahead in love, you know. 

876
01:04:49,540 --> 01:04:52,160
 Does he even like me? 

877
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:55,570
 I'm a slow person, so at my own pace, 

878
01:04:55,570 --> 01:04:58,760
 I will walk towards you step by step.
