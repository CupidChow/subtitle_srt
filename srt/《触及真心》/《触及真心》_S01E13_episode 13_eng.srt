1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:07,120


2
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:34,900
 Touch Your Heart 

3
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,070
 Touch Your Heart 

4
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:46,900
I really enjoyed today.

5
00:00:46,900 --> 00:00:49,930
That was a movie that I wanted to watch with you,

6
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:53,040
so I was really happy to watch it with you like this.

7
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:57,000
If that's the case, I'm glad.

8
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,020
It was totally perfect.

9
00:00:59,020 --> 00:01:02,870
Your special farewell party that you prepared.

10
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:06,240
The feeling of the word "farewell party" is a little sad.

11
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,400
That makes it feel like we're separating,

12
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,600
but we're only unable to meet at the law firm, that's all.

13
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,610
Of course, that's also really saddening.

14
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,380
Oh Yoon Seo.

15
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:28,720
Why are you calling me Oh Yoon Seo all of a sudden?

16
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:34,700
Thanks to you, I was happy.

17
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:40,050
Why are you saying that?

18
00:01:43,450 --> 00:01:45,490
Like what happened in the movie earlier,

19
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:50,170
Oh Jin Sim, I want you to return to your place as Oh Yoon Seo,

20
00:01:51,930 --> 00:01:57,480
and I will return to my original place.

21
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:01,860
♫ Your warmth which is left on   ♫

22
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:05,080
What are you saying, Mr. Lawyer?

23
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:13,170
♫  my left fingertip  ♫

24
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:19,290
♫  is covering the left side of my breast ♫

25
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,110
Let's...

26
00:02:22,090 --> 00:02:24,580
♫ As it was then  ♫

27
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:26,800
break up.

28
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:32,450
♫  I'm saying I can't let go ♫

29
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:35,260
What's the matter with you all of a sudden?

30
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:38,080
Did I do something wrong?

31
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,100
Is it because I deceived you?

32
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:47,080
As you think about it, do you feel betrayed? Or ...

33
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:53,090
are you uncomfortable because we were both photographed?

34
00:02:53,090 --> 00:02:57,310
Do you feel burdened because people stare?

35
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:04,760
Please tell me. Is that why we must break up?

36
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:09,410
Yes.

37
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:13,840
Because of the reasons you've stated,

38
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,200
I think it's unreasonable to meet any more.

39
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,810
So

40
00:03:19,890 --> 00:03:23,540
I think we should stop here.

41
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:25,540
Mr. Lawyer.

42
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,420
I am grateful

43
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:34,300
for everything.

44
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:37,800
♫ which touched your small hand, still ♫

45
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:44,890
♫ cannot forget the eyes which looked   ♫

46
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:50,100
♫ and held each other  ♫

47
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:58,290
♫ Don't leave yet.  Don't let my hand go.  ♫

48
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:06,250

 Episode 13 

56
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:05,110
Yoon Seo.

57
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:08,040
Oh Yoon Seo?

58
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,110
Is she still asleep?

59
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:15,000
Yoon Seo.

60
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,660
Yoon Seo. Why are you doing that?

61
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,850
Yoon Seo, are you crying?

62
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:26,450
Oppa.

63
00:05:26,450 --> 00:05:29,280
Yes, yes.  I'm here. Because I'm here,

64
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,240
tell me everything.  What's the matter, Yoon Seo?

65
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:36,330
Mr. Lawyer broke up with me.

66
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:39,100
What?

67
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:43,110
He told me we better stop here.

68
00:05:47,310 --> 00:05:50,380
After he said he liked me a lot.

69
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,180
And he promised to be at my side forever.

70
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:03,400
How could he change so suddenly?

71
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,800
How can it end like that with a few words?

72
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:12,100
This is my first break-up.

73
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:15,980
I don't know what to do or anything.

74
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:28,930
Yoon Seo.  First of all, I'm going to the law firm today to pick up your stuff.

75
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:32,250
I'll go by myself.  You should rest.

76
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,460
No, I'll go.

77
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:37,580
No, Yoon Seo. I don't think you're in your right mind now to do that.

78
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:40,760
Even so, I still need to see him.

79
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:44,130
Yoon Seo. Yoon Seo.

80
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:57,210
CEO, why are you sighing like that?

81
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:02,780
Something is dark at the law firm.  Is a fluorescent light out?

82
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:05,420
No, sir, I don't think so.

83
00:07:05,420 --> 00:07:11,080
The six fluorescent lights are in position and are all fulfilling their roles.

84
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:15,370
Is that so?  But why does it seem somber and dark?

85
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:19,020
Is it because of Oh Yoon Seo?

86
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:23,970
That's right. Because the brilliant goddess has left, the law firm is drained of vitality.

87
00:07:23,970 --> 00:07:27,900
That's right.  It somehow feels a little empty.

88
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:31,710
When we are feeling like this, how empty Lawyer Kwon must feel.

89
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,140
All of this time Yoon Seo was doing a great job as a secretary.

90
00:07:35,140 --> 00:07:37,610
How large will the vacancy be?

91
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:44,420
He must feel like a little deer with nowhere to go in the vast emptiness.

92
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,830
I don't know about any little deer, but anyway Secretary Yang please help Lawyer Kwon.

93
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:52,510
Yes. I'll pay more attention to him.

94
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:55,460
Oh, Yoon Seo.

95
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:57,480
Yoon Seo!

96
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,040
What brings you here?

97
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:02,040
Weren't you going to stop coming to work starting today?

98
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,200
I've come to pick up my stuff.

99
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,450
We could've sent it by courier.

100
00:08:07,450 --> 00:08:09,990
Why go through the bother of coming?

101
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:11,730
Just because.

102
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:26,150
But she looks a little down today.

103
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,840
Mr. Lawyer.

104
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:47,230
I'll be going.

105
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:55,370
I said I'm going.

106
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:03,540
If we continue like this, we are truly finished.

107
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,700
Even so, aren't you going to look?

108
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:42,110
You worked hard all of this time.

109
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:48,510
I wish you all the best in the future.

110
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,580
♫  With the door locked tight  ♫

111
00:11:13,820 --> 00:11:17,730
♫  I've been curled up under a blanket all day  ♫

112
00:11:20,750 --> 00:11:24,700
♫  It will be better when I fall asleep  ♫

113
00:11:26,660 --> 00:11:31,000
♫  I want everything every where to come to a halt.  ♫

114
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:38,220
♫  I wish you the best. That's the one thing  ♫

115
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:44,140
♫  which won't leave my head all day.  ♫

116
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,680
♫   I who am in the pictures with you  ♫

117
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:57,840
♫  don't know anything  and I'm just smiling  ♫

118
00:11:59,460 --> 00:12:02,670
♫  Because of my foolish pride  ♫

119
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:06,140
♫  Only a deeper wound was left.  ♫

120
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:10,280
♫  I'm sorry. Why was it then  ♫

121
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:12,290
♫  Why did I only know my self?.  ♫

122
00:12:12,290 --> 00:12:15,760
♫  Phtogrpahs which are in my hand  ♫

123

125
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,730
♫  You won't come back again  ♫

126
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:36,200
 Whatever.  Whenever. Just tell me. 

127
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:46,780
- Yeah?
  - You want to have a glass of soju this evening? 

128
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,160
Sure, let's do that.

129
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,840
I was thinking of having some soju, anyway.

130
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,250
Kwon Jeong Rok!

131
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:08,530
What's this? Why are you two...?

132
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:13,100
We decided to date again.

133
00:13:16,390 --> 00:13:20,090
Yoo Yeo Reum was really clinging on to me, so I decided to accept her.

134
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:25,250
She was so determined to win back my love, I've surrendered unconditionally.

135
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:29,400
Are you really going to joke in front of Jeong Rok? Don't you know that he can't get jokes because he's so serious?

136
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,800
Hey, no. It's because you don't know this.

137
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:36,780
He's not the same serious and stiff Kwon Jeong Rok of the past.

138
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:39,290
He's changed a lot.

139
00:13:39,290 --> 00:13:42,060
He became so soft while he's been dating.

140
00:13:42,060 --> 00:13:45,090
- Really?
 - Of course!

141
00:13:46,510 --> 00:13:51,130
If the old Kwon Jeong Rok was this stiff and hard dried squid,

142
00:13:51,130 --> 00:13:56,700
then as he's been dating, he's become soft and tender like this rolled omelet.

143
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:02,590
Why do you look like that? Do you not like my comparison?

144
00:14:02,590 --> 00:14:06,000
I think Yoon Seo would acknowledge what I'm saying.

145
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,810
Ah, let's not do this. While I'm talking about it,

146
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,860
let's tell Yoon Seo to come here. Okay?

147
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,200
Yeah, tell her to come if she's okay with it.

148
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:15,600
You need to brace yourself. You'll probably be really surprised when you personally see

149
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,100
how much he's fallen for her.

150
00:14:21,250 --> 00:14:24,450
Why aren't you hurrying up and calling her?

151
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:32,090
Wait. Is this place too simple to call Yoon Seo here?

152
00:14:32,090 --> 00:14:33,790
Shall we move to the wine bar near here?

153
00:14:33,790 --> 00:14:38,290
- Let's do that. This place is too open, so it will be too burdensome for Yoon Seo.
 - Right?

154
00:14:38,290 --> 00:14:40,570
There's no need to do that.

155
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:44,050
Why? Are you saying that because you think we'll bother Yoon Seo?

156
00:14:44,050 --> 00:14:48,150
Look at him. This is how much he treasures Yoon Seo.

157
00:14:49,530 --> 00:14:51,550
We broke up.

158
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:54,370
What do you...?

159
00:14:58,320 --> 00:15:00,960
Wait, how?

160
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:05,050
I think you two will be uncomfortable with me here today.

161
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:08,120
Let's get together some other time.

162
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,970
I'll go first.  Enjoy yourselves.

163
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:28,850
Kwon Jeong Rok!

164
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:36,140
Hey. How could you leave like that? Let's go have a glass of soju. I sent Yeo Reum home.

165
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:39,760
- For what?
 - What do you mean, for what?

166
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,440
I should have realized that something was off when you spoke like that.

167
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:48,150
Let's hurry up and go.

168
00:15:54,460 --> 00:15:58,140
 - Ma'am, please give me another glass of soju! 
- Okay! 

169
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:03,690
So you let Yoon Seo go for the sake of her own happiness?

170
00:16:10,190 --> 00:16:12,720
Why did you do that if you were going to be suffering like this?

171
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,030
No matter how it turned out, you should have gone to the end.

172
00:16:17,070 --> 00:16:22,490
Because I know very well how badly she wanted to go down that path.

173
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:29,030
I could become a stumbling block on that path,

174
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:32,740
so how could I do that?

175
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:38,960
I found that there was no other way but to let her go.

176
00:16:38,960 --> 00:16:41,050
But, still...

177
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:46,270
Yoon Seo won't know about this reason

178
00:16:46,270 --> 00:16:51,140
and will remember you as a horrible guy who suddenly changed. That's a little...

179
00:16:56,390 --> 00:17:01,760
So, how did you get through it?

180
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,370
I'm talking about when you broke up with Yeo Reum.

181
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,450
I'm asking how you got through it.

182
00:17:19,270 --> 00:17:23,680
 The Copyright Infringement Act introduced actions for compensation. 

183
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:25,200
  If it is determined that the defendant infringed, 

184
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,200
 when viewed in the light that it's being marketed, 

185
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:32,400
  the computation of individual and independent damages for the development of the original software 

186
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,800
 would be a considerable amount based on the extent of the infringement. 

187
00:17:34,810 --> 00:17:38,240
 As a result of the difference in the method of evaluating overseas investment funds and domestic appraisal, 

188
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,040
 in the investigation of pro forma slush funds related to overseas real estate investment, 

189
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:46,040
 we estimate the company lost five billion.

193
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:09,830
 You don't know much about the imposition of legal sanctions for anti-competitive acts by in house laborers. 

194
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:13,410
 The defendant while in office developed a program 

195
00:18:13,410 --> 00:18:17,120
  which took into consideration the  huge operating profit generated by the accused company. 

196
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,720
 Please grant the defendant the maximum leniency the law allows. 

197

206
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,470
Alright, let's toast to our Lawyer Kwon, who made first in sales. Cheers!

207
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:08,820
Cheers!

208
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:16,280
Lawyer Kwon, it's nice to see you acting like a person who's crazy about their work these days.

209
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:22,740
It would be nice if you would answer when I say something, Lawyer Kwon.

210
00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:27,230
But what's the big deal about getting first in sales that we're having a team dinner like this?

211
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,030
Well, what does first in sales mean? It's the driving force that allows Always to exist tomorrow.

212
00:19:31,030 --> 00:19:35,750
Lawyer Choi, when will you become the star sitting in this spot?

213
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,760
You said that you'd let go of your sense of duty and your sense of justice to focus on getting sales.

214
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:41,670
I just want to let you go, Lawyer Choi.

215
00:19:41,670 --> 00:19:46,450
Hey, wait! You're taking it too far with those words, seriously!

216
00:19:46,450 --> 00:19:48,890
I think you're the one taking it too far, Lawyer Dan.

217
00:19:48,890 --> 00:19:51,410
Lawyer Dan, have I done something to hurt you recently?

218
00:19:51,410 --> 00:19:55,860
Is that why you've come here all casually to protest against me while grumbling and doing like this?

219
00:19:55,860 --> 00:20:00,030
CEO, she's pretty. Why are you saying that?

220
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:03,000
That's what I'm saying. You should just worry about yourself,

221
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:06,320
and stop getting stuff on your lips while you eat.

222
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,690
Really?

223
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:15,240
It's not a big deal.  It's just embarrassing to say that in front of people.

224
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:18,770
Wait, what's with this atmosphere?

225
00:20:19,540 --> 00:20:22,880
Earlier, Lawyer Dan took care of Lawyer Choi, and now Lawyer Choi is taking care of Lawyer Dan.

226
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:26,900
You can't fool me. Are you too, perhaps ...

227
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,270
forming an alliance? It seems like you're taking care of each other

228
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:34,480
as the lawyers who need to raise their performance.

229
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,650
There's no way.

230
00:20:35,650 --> 00:20:37,740
But I like seeing it.

231
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,900
You two used to argue like cats and dogs,

232
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:45,000
but now your relationship has become warm like cherry blossoms blooming along a railroad track on a spring day, has it not?

233
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:49,700
Office Manager, I think you're speaking very poetically. I don't think you realize it, do you?

234
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,480
You'll become a poet if you go on like this.

235
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:55,890
That is .. hold on to the thought.  That is a dream I have.

236
00:20:55,890 --> 00:21:00,970
Really? Then write a poem with me as the subject. Title it "Charisma" or something like that.

237
00:21:02,890 --> 00:21:04,920
That's intense.

238
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:13,680
Yes. Lawyer Kwon, why aren't you smiling?

239
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:17,430
You're just frowning and ruining the mood.

240
00:21:17,430 --> 00:21:19,410
What's wrong with him not smiling?

241
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,780
He's got skills. It's fine if you don't smile, Lawyer Choi, so please gain some skills.

242
00:21:22,780 --> 00:21:27,170
Lawyer Kwon, let's have a glass. Let's have a glass with no expression on our faces.

243
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:32,250
Let's toast with no expression on our faces.

244
00:21:36,490 --> 00:21:38,400
Drink up.

245
00:22:32,190 --> 00:22:34,790
 Oh Yoon Seo.  Autograph Meeting for Fans 

246
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:39,410
Oh Yoon Seo.

247
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,900
 Lee Se Jin 
 Oh Yoon Seo 
 Love is the Painful Law. 

248
00:22:56,960 --> 00:22:59,510
You dropped this.

249
00:22:59,510 --> 00:23:05,190
Oh, thank you. I really hate making mistakes.

250
00:23:05,190 --> 00:23:09,280
I dislike people who make mistakes, but you're the first one to look cute when you make a mistake.

251
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:12,080
Even if I wrote it, I feel shy.

252
00:23:12,830 --> 00:23:15,470
However, it's fine when you say it to Yoon Seo, right?

253
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,910
Our Yoon Seo did the script reading.
  Stills of Oh Yoon Seo at her comeback drama's script reading "Love Is A Painful Law." 

254
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:24,810
Ah, she's doing alright.

255
00:23:24,810 --> 00:23:27,150
She looks pretty here. Look!

256
00:23:27,150 --> 00:23:30,190
Our Yoon Seo is still as pretty.

257
00:23:30,190 --> 00:23:33,590
She looks happier than when she was at the law firm.

258
00:23:33,590 --> 00:23:35,730
Is it because she's doing something she really likes?

259
00:23:35,730 --> 00:23:38,640
Ah, I miss our Yoon Seo.

260
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,500
Me, too. We built some affection, so I also think of her from time to time.

261
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:47,380
Our times together in the employee lounge were fun.

262
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:49,610
I miss her, too.

263
00:23:49,610 --> 00:23:52,230
I'm not the only missing her, right?

264
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,890
But, Lawyer Kwon, why are you not saying anything?

265
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:59,350
Don't you miss Yoon Seo?

266
00:24:00,910 --> 00:24:03,140
Do you hear me?

267
00:24:03,140 --> 00:24:07,380
Anyway, he isn't humane, but he's a human.

268
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:10,320
Wait a minute. I don't see Lawyer Dan or Lawyer Choi.

269
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:13,880
Both of them seemed to have appointments.

270
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:21,680
Honey. How do I look today?

271
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:30,430
Honey, you said you liked women who wore dresses, so I went online shopping.

272
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:33,610
Well, it looks good.

273
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,760
Oh, honey!

274
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,760
Eat this. Dipped in sweet peanut butter sauce, as sweet as you, honey.

275
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,460
Ah!

276
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:48,210
Lawyer Dan, I'm good.

277
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:51,640
And, Lawyer Dan, I meant to tell you this earlier.

278
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:57,820
Even if we are in a dating contract, the nickname of "Honey" sounds excessive.

279
00:24:57,820 --> 00:25:00,850
And it wasn't a statement in the conditions

280
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:04,020
Yes, I understand.

281
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:28,330
Lawyer Dan, I hope you didn't forget the conditions in the contract.

282
00:25:28,330 --> 00:25:31,880
I'll remind you of them again.

283
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,150
1. The dating period is one month.

284
00:25:36,150 --> 00:25:38,970
We still have five days left. I didn't forget that.

285
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:45,510
2. During the dating period, third parties, overlapping relationship, and any other kinds of flirting is prohibited.

286
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:49,830
Of course. I only have Lawyer Choi right now, no one else.

287
00:25:50,610 --> 00:25:54,860
3. During the dating period, both parties must eat together at least twice per week.

288
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:58,440
That's why we are eating Chinese food together.

289
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:02,450
Then, what's the problem?

290
00:26:02,450 --> 00:26:06,840
There are also conditions to void the contract. 
 1. Physical touch is prohibited.

291
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,500
Then, is the contract being nullified because we touched hands while both reaching for the sauce?

292
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:16,700
Well, we can deliberate over that.

293
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,000
I'll end up this with a first warning. Please be careful next time.

294
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:21,090
Yes, I'll really be careful.

295
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,510
Just a moment, please.

296
00:26:26,660 --> 00:26:29,820
Yes, I am Lawyer Choi Yoon Hyeok.

297
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:38,800
Wow, I almost got in trouble. A contract void almost happened.

298
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:41,750
This is so thrilling.

299
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:46,950
Left hand, let's be cautious. I'm giving you a warning!

300
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,650
Does she like me that much? Of course, I understand her.

301
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:57,930
However, that overflowing love is excessive.

302
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:02,120
What should I do?

303
00:27:02,120 --> 00:27:05,990
I know she's a nice and cute person,

304
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:10,410
but my heart is not being moved.

305
00:27:10,410 --> 00:27:12,870
My heart.

306
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,620
Kwon Jeong Rok!

307
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:32,340
I found it weird that you didn't drive your car these days. You were taking the bus?

308
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,790
Yes, well.

309
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,460
It's still a coincidence we met like that, so you want to get a glass of soju?

310
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:42,200
Forget it. Just go.

311
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:47,950
Let's go together!

312
00:27:56,090 --> 00:28:00,070
Aigoo, you're tired. You're really tired. It's hard, right?

313
00:28:00,070 --> 00:28:02,260
You didn't sleep a wink yesterday?

314
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:06,330
How do I have time to sleep? There are so many lines to memorize.

315
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:12,830
That's right, there are so many legal terms making it difficult to memorize the script.

316
00:28:13,940 --> 00:28:17,910
But, working at the law firm was helpful.

317
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:20,830
Since I've already heard a lot of these terms before,

318
00:28:20,830 --> 00:28:24,130
it makes it easier to memorize and to understand.

319
00:28:24,130 --> 00:28:26,890
- We have arrived. 
 - Already?

320
00:28:26,890 --> 00:28:31,580
What to do? I think it'll end at dawn again.

321
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,860
It's okay! Oh, my back

322
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:39,530
I need to stretch once I get off.

323
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,070
 Oh, hello! 

324
00:28:41,070 --> 00:28:43,330
Thank god,

325
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:46,440
she was able to return to her position this quickly.

326
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:55,030
 Supreme Court Information 

327
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:03,290
 Stills of Oh Yoon Seo at her comeback drama's script reading "Love Is A Painful Law." 

328
00:29:08,950 --> 00:29:12,450
She looks alright now.

329
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:22,130
Cheers!

330
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:29,030
But, what's in that large bag?

331
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:32,360
Ah, this is a gift I prepared for you.

332
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:36,600
This is a mask to protect your health from the fine dust.

333
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:42,330
This is not for my health, but rather protecting me from other women.

334
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,840
Yes!

335
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:49,720
And these are skincare products to make your honey-like skin even sweeter.

336
00:29:49,720 --> 00:29:53,220
And, these are vitamins to up your loveliness factor.

337
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:56,770
- And, this is to make you cooler— 
 - Wait a minute.

338
00:29:58,440 --> 00:30:02,090
Lawyer Dan, do you like me this much?

339
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:07,320
Of course, I have a fatal charm that cannot help but be liked.

340
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,910
However, is it really that much?

341
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:13,190
It is this much. It is so fatal that the more I see you

342
00:30:13,190 --> 00:30:17,020
and the more I get to know you, the more I like you.

343
00:30:19,190 --> 00:30:21,840
That is why I'm sad.

344
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:28,000
I'm this happy, but I only have five days remaining.

345
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,710
Tell me honestly.

346
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:42,670
How was it to date me for almost a month?

347
00:30:42,670 --> 00:30:49,550
Are you going to end things with me in five days without looking back?

348
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:58,520
Lawyer Dan, you are a really good person.

349
00:30:59,430 --> 00:31:03,820
You take good care of me. You are cute.

350
00:31:05,030 --> 00:31:07,600
However, how should I say this?

351
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:17,030
You are not moving my heart.

352
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,890
Pardon?

353
00:31:27,790 --> 00:31:32,670
Are you okay, Lawyer Dan? Why did you drink so much?

354
00:31:32,670 --> 00:31:35,730
Why do you think? I really like you.

355
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:41,700
I'm pained that after the contract is over, we are going to return to the same way we were before.

356
00:31:41,700 --> 00:31:44,700
However, what can I do?

357
00:31:44,700 --> 00:31:49,010
I'm guilty of not being able to move your heart.

358
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:40,350
Are you okay?

359
00:32:40,350 --> 00:32:43,030
Yes. I'm okay.

360
00:32:46,300 --> 00:32:50,000
I'm relieved. Then, I apologize.

361
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,960
W-Wait...

362
00:32:57,960 --> 00:33:02,200
What is this expression? Don't tell me you fell for that person?

363
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:06,380
Yes. Isn't that person fine?

364
00:33:06,380 --> 00:33:10,690
You were just saying that you liked me, that you were pained.

365
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:15,320
You told me that I don't move your heart.

366
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:18,580
I'm quite quick on giving up.

367
00:33:21,020 --> 00:33:24,350
E-Excuse me! My legs...

368
00:33:24,350 --> 00:33:28,020
I think I hurt my legs. So, can you tell me your contact information?

369
00:33:28,020 --> 00:33:32,270
No, give me a ride! Excuse me!

370
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:36,590
My heart...

371
00:33:36,590 --> 00:33:38,530
Why does my heart hurt?

372
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,760
-  I'm quite quick on giving up.  
 - What?

373
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:48,420
Yes, Mother. A blind date?

374
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:53,370
Mother, I told you that I have no intention of having a blind date. Yes, I'll hang up.

375
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:57,970
- Office Manager, it seems your Mother wants you to go on a blind date? 
 - Yes.

376
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:01,630
But, I have no intention of having a blind date.

377
00:34:01,630 --> 00:34:07,430
I am one of the people who believe humans are linked by a thread of fate.

378
00:34:07,430 --> 00:34:13,160
What kind of nonsense is that? The defendant's agent requested to change the court date multiple times already.

379
00:34:13,160 --> 00:34:15,430
He really has no manners.

380
00:34:15,430 --> 00:34:17,710
I'll start by changing the court date.

381
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:20,780
Then, I'll submit the other documents related to the case to the court separately.

382
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:23,430
- Where is Kwon Jeong Rok? Where is he? 
 - Ma'am.

383
00:34:23,430 --> 00:34:27,910
- Calm down first. 
 - Where is Kwon Jeong Rok? I said where is he.

384
00:34:27,910 --> 00:34:30,190
Kwon Jeong Rok...

385
00:34:30,190 --> 00:34:35,270
He was here. You remember my son, right?

386
00:34:35,270 --> 00:34:39,260
You made my son into a murderer in the courtroom in  a moment!

387
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:41,440
Park Soo Myeong.

388
00:34:42,830 --> 00:34:45,570
 Who killed Kim Hyeok Tae? 

389
00:34:45,570 --> 00:34:49,850
 Th-the one who stabbed him is... The one who stabbed him is— 

390
00:34:49,850 --> 00:34:51,700
 Soo Myeong, don't! Don't say anything! 

391
00:34:51,700 --> 00:34:53,060
 Defendant, please have a seat. 

392
00:34:53,060 --> 00:34:56,510
 Don't hit Noona! Don't hit her! Don't hit Noona! 

393
00:34:56,510 --> 00:35:01,170
I came to find you because I felt it was so unjust for him.

394
00:35:01,170 --> 00:35:03,790
- Mother, please calm down first and—
 - Let me go!

395
00:35:03,790 --> 00:35:08,970
Does it seem like I'd be calm? This person made my son into a murderer!

396
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:14,880
I'm telling you, my child isn't the type of person

397
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,930
to stab someone with a knife twice!

398
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:28,300
Mother, I understand how you feel,

399
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:32,230
but this isn't something that Lawyer Kwon decided on his own.

400
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:36,560
This case has already been judged by the court. So—

401
00:35:36,560 --> 00:35:40,410
Tomorrow is his last trial. What should my Soo Myeong do?

402
00:35:40,410 --> 00:35:44,030
What happens if my Soo Myeong can't come out into the world ever again?

403
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:47,920
I will never, ever forgive you.

404
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:50,740
Never!

405
00:35:52,850 --> 00:35:54,730
Mother...

406
00:35:58,060 --> 00:36:02,730
Lawyer Kwon, don't worry about it too much. All parents feel the same.

407
00:36:02,730 --> 00:36:06,760
When a situation becomes like this, they say that their child didn't do it

408
00:36:06,760 --> 00:36:11,460
and deny the judgment because they want to believe that their child isn't the culprit.

409
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:14,070
Isn't that right, Secretary Yang?

410
00:36:14,070 --> 00:36:16,510
Well, that's actually true.

411
00:36:16,510 --> 00:36:20,230
My Jin Yi was charged as the perpetrator of the school violence case before.

412
00:36:20,230 --> 00:36:22,540
I felt this as I went through that experience.

413
00:36:22,540 --> 00:36:24,750
First of all, when your child is driven into a corner,

414
00:36:24,750 --> 00:36:27,970
it's difficult for a parent to make normal judgments.

415
00:36:27,970 --> 00:36:30,470
Your head goes blank and you can't think of anything.

416
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:34,190
Mr. Park Soo Myeong's mother probably also needs someone to resent.

417
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:36,240
The situation turned out like this,

418
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,820
so couldn't it be that she had to hate and resent you

419
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,800
in order to make it through this?

420
00:36:42,620 --> 00:36:45,580
So, please be understanding of her.

421
00:36:53,510 --> 00:36:56,210
 Prosecutor, conduct your examination. 

422
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:03,210
 The defendant Park Soo Myeong was identified by Im Yoon Hui, the wife of the victim Kim Hyeong Tae. 

423
00:37:03,210 --> 00:37:06,010
 On the night of the crime, January 12, 2019, 

424
00:37:06,010 --> 00:37:08,320
 in order to save Im Yoo Hui, who was being violently assaulted, 

425
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,620
 the defendant stabbed the victim with a knife. 

426
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:14,610
 If it was done in order to save Im Yoon Hui from violent assault, 

427
00:37:14,610 --> 00:37:17,680
 then he had adequate chance to search for other methods, 

428
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:20,440
 such as calling the police or taking Im Yoon Hui and running. 

429
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:23,270
 However, the defendant chose the most extreme method 

430
00:37:23,270 --> 00:37:27,390
 and stabbed the victim in both the stomach and the chest, 

431
00:37:27,390 --> 00:37:29,480
 murdering him. 

432
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:31,220
 In cases like this, 

433
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,710
 after the defendant's first act in an accidental situation 

434
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:37,670
 it wasn't an act of self-defense taken to save Im Yoon Hui. 

435
00:37:37,670 --> 00:37:39,820
 It was behavior inherent in the defendant. 

436
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:43,230
 Even if violence is expressed, it was not in a  reasonable amount. 

437
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,000
 As seen from the examination, 

438
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:50,000
 the defendant needs to spend considerable  time in isolation separated from our society. 

439
00:37:53,110 --> 00:37:57,960
 We ask that he be sentenced to twenty years in prison. 

440
00:38:03,250 --> 00:38:05,680
 Defense, please give your final argument. 

441
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:09,280
 The defendant acknowledges all charges regarding this case, 

442
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,190
 There are many points that he must reflect on and 

443
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:14,320
 we ask the court consider his circumstance and show him mercy. 

444
00:38:16,500 --> 00:38:19,900
 The verdict in Case no. 2019, No. 173,  Defendant Park Soo Myeong 

445
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:26,800
   who was charged with murder, is as follows. 

446
00:38:27,940 --> 00:38:32,530
 It is ordered that the Defendant will serve twenty years in prison. 

447
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:37,280
 You can't! No! My Soo Myeong didn't kill him! 

448
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,520
My child isn't a bad person!

449
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:42,240
 - No!
 - Mom! Don't bully my mom! 

450
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,050
 - Don't bully my mom! Don't bully her!
 - Soo Myeong. Soo Myeong. 

451
00:38:45,050 --> 00:38:49,740
 - No. No. 
  - Don't bully my mom! 

452
00:38:49,740 --> 00:38:53,040
 Mom. Mom. 

453
00:38:53,040 --> 00:39:00,620
 - Mom! Mom!
 - My son! No! He didn't kill him! 

454
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,850
Mr. Lawyer, please save my Soo Myeong.

455
00:39:36,850 --> 00:39:40,550
My Soo Myeong didn't kill anyone.

456
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:43,410
It's all my fault.

457
00:39:43,410 --> 00:39:46,540
You're doing this because you don't know that.

458
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:50,790
So, Lawyer, please come.

459
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:56,930
I understand how you feel very well, Mother.

460
00:39:56,930 --> 00:40:01,330
However, because Park Soo Myeong already confessed all his crimes in court—

461
00:40:01,330 --> 00:40:05,550
Then you should listen to that confession or whatever it is until the end!

462
00:40:05,550 --> 00:40:08,480
Why didn't you listen to him properly? Why?

463
00:40:08,480 --> 00:40:13,110
My son said he only stabbed him once.

464
00:40:13,110 --> 00:40:18,690
So Im Yoon Hui may have stabbed him the other time.

465
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:25,240
Even if I don't know anything else, I know my son isn't a liar.

466
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:28,970
I was suspicious of that girl Im Yoon Hui.

467
00:40:30,780 --> 00:40:34,180
She said that she treasured my Soo Myeong enough to frame herself as the murderer.

468
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:37,590
But she's never visited him once since he was indicted.

469
00:40:37,590 --> 00:40:42,370
She's disappeared from our neighborhood.

470
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:07,260
 Im Yoon Hui's Statement. 

471
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:22,900
 The number you are calling does not exist. 

472
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:34,910
Unni, you've always been pretty, but you're  really  pretty today.

473
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,880
With makeup, you're even more so.

474
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,690
That's right. You really look like a goddess today, Unni.

475
00:41:39,690 --> 00:41:41,300
I'll have to take a picture of you later.

476
00:41:41,300 --> 00:41:43,650
Why would you take a picture? Why?

477
00:41:43,650 --> 00:41:45,010
Did you two come to play?

478
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:48,370
Be quiet, this is an emotional scene for our Yoon Seo!

479
00:41:48,370 --> 00:41:51,730
We should help the actress tap into her emotions and get immersed in them  as much as we can!

480
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,970
Is that right or not?

481
00:41:53,970 --> 00:41:56,310
Why? Are you displeased?

482
00:41:56,310 --> 00:41:57,950
We're beginning filming!

483
00:41:57,950 --> 00:42:01,130
- Okay!
 - We're ready!

484
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:06,430
And action!

485
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:13,830
What is it? What are you going to say that you're stuttering like that?

486
00:42:17,330 --> 00:42:19,380
What are you going to say?

487
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:24,640
Let's... stop dating.

488
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:26,720
I'm saying we should break up.

489
00:42:27,430 --> 00:42:29,170
 Let's... 

490
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:35,260
 break up. 

491
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:54,120
Okay! Yoon Seo, that's really good!

492
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:59,140
Wow!

493
00:42:59,140 --> 00:43:02,100
I'm sorry. One moment, please.

494
00:43:06,980 --> 00:43:11,460
Wow, to think that Oh Yoon Seo could act out such deep emotions.

495
00:43:11,460 --> 00:43:15,060
I know, right? It seems that she got so into character that she can't control her emotions.

496
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:21,130
Wow, her acting has improved so much. You won't have to worry about her being called a bad actress now.

497
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:26,010
What's bad acting? You can let go of those kinds of worries now.

498
00:43:27,360 --> 00:43:29,990
One moment, Mr. Director.

499
00:43:39,260 --> 00:43:41,670
Yoon Seo, are you okay?

500
00:43:47,690 --> 00:43:50,240
Why are you crying so much?

501
00:43:51,390 --> 00:43:54,950
Are you like this because you're thinking of him?

502
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:57,060
I was trying...

503
00:43:58,640 --> 00:44:01,520
I was trying to forget him however I could.

504
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,460
But when I think of Mr. Lawyer suddenly out of nowhere like this,

505
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,990
I get unavoidably sad.

506
00:44:09,830 --> 00:44:13,630
I thought that you were okay now.

507
00:44:13,630 --> 00:44:17,790
How could I be okay? I liked him so much.

508
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:24,150
But, I can't do anything about it. I have to think about

509
00:44:24,150 --> 00:44:29,750
the people who are working for me and who are waiting for me to come back.

510
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,700
And if I keep having a hard time like this,

511
00:44:38,340 --> 00:44:41,410
Mr. Lawyer won't like it, either.

512
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:46,390
Oppa, I'm sorry.

513
00:44:47,150 --> 00:44:54,290
I'll try to pull myself together, one way or another.

514
00:44:55,330 --> 00:45:00,980
Alright. I'm sorry, too. Rest for a little while, Yoon Seo.

515
00:45:10,180 --> 00:45:12,850
He's probably doing well, right?

516
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:16,580
I looked into Im Yoon Hui during the first trial.

517
00:45:16,580 --> 00:45:19,250
With the emergence of Park Soo Myeong as the real culprit,

518
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,160
she was released on bail.

519
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:24,110
After that her trail became strange.

520
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:29,050
Even when I asked the people in the neighborhood, not one of them has seen Im Yoon Hui.

521
00:45:30,540 --> 00:45:32,450
I asked, just in case.

522
00:45:32,450 --> 00:45:35,730
There were eleven insurance policies insuring Kim Hyeong Tae.

523
00:45:35,730 --> 00:45:38,890
They said part of it was paid out to Im Yoon Hui.

524
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:43,930
Out of a total of 4.94 billion, she received 2.73 billion in insurance.

525
00:45:44,850 --> 00:45:46,640
Is that insurance money possibly...?

526
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,140
It seems she withdrew it all in cash

527
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:50,280
and disappeared.

528
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:55,070
So she wasn't paid the full amount of money, yet she disappeared?

529
00:45:55,070 --> 00:45:56,420
Something is suspicious, isn't it?

530
00:45:56,420 --> 00:46:00,440
Let's meet with the insurance company in charge of her first.

531
00:46:01,370 --> 00:46:03,570
When exactly did you meet Im Yoon Hui?

532
00:46:03,570 --> 00:46:05,940
February 27.

533
00:46:05,940 --> 00:46:11,310
We met briefly because she had to sign some documents about receiving insurance payments.

534
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:13,480
Ah. We met at this cafe.

535
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,150
Do you remember anything in particular from the conversation?

536
00:46:16,150 --> 00:46:21,440
For example, where she was going or whom she was seeing?

537
00:46:21,440 --> 00:46:24,880
No, there isn't anything special.

538
00:46:25,960 --> 00:46:33,050
Ah.  But then, she kept on looking outside while we were talking.

539
00:46:33,050 --> 00:46:36,070
So I looked because I was wondering what it was.

540
00:46:36,070 --> 00:46:38,610
Are you saying a man was waiting for her?

541
00:46:41,340 --> 00:46:45,040
After she left me, I saw her get into a car.

542
00:46:47,500 --> 00:46:50,070
So I thought she was going with him.

543
00:46:50,070 --> 00:46:54,710
I was really curious about what kind of person she was since the case was so widely talked about.

544
00:46:54,710 --> 00:46:58,650
But I thought that it was very strange that she came with a man.

545
00:47:11,690 --> 00:47:13,170
With whom did she leave?

546
00:47:13,170 --> 00:47:17,460
Perhaps it's a man she lives with?

547
00:47:17,460 --> 00:47:20,070
I know she doesn't have any family.

548
00:47:20,980 --> 00:47:25,670
In any case, if Oh Yoon Seo learns about it, she's going to be very surprised.

549
00:47:25,670 --> 00:47:29,640
Yoon Seo worked really hard on this case.

550
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:32,890
She even went with you to Im Yoon Hui's house.

551
00:47:32,890 --> 00:47:37,080
- She really worried about you when Park Soo Myeong hit you like that.
  - Are you okay? 

552
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,770
 Oh Jin Sim, are you alright? 

553
00:47:38,770 --> 00:47:40,910
 What about you, Mr. Lawyer? Where you got hurt... 

554
00:47:40,910 --> 00:47:45,120
  What should I do?  You're still bleeding. Oh dear. 

555
00:47:53,620 --> 00:47:55,410
Let's go.

556
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:01,510
What? You're going to take the Park Soo Myeong appeal?

557
00:48:01,510 --> 00:48:03,760
Appearing as a  witness in court,

558
00:48:03,760 --> 00:48:07,580
you're the one who pointed Park Soo Myeong out as the real culprit.

559
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,030
But now you're saying there's another real culprit?

560
00:48:10,030 --> 00:48:13,200
Park Soo Myeong's lawyer, what kind of ...

561
00:48:13,200 --> 00:48:17,380
I don't know.  I'm going to pretend I didn't hear that, so leave. No, I'll leave.

562
00:48:17,380 --> 00:48:21,460
- Mr. CEO.
 - Why are you trying to gamble on something that isn't certain?

563
00:48:21,460 --> 00:48:25,820
Lawyer Kwon. You know it's a breach of the attorney code of ethics.

564
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,140
Forget it. Anyway, you can't do this.

565
00:48:31,140 --> 00:48:34,780
I definitely told you that you can't do it. So keep that in mind.

566
00:48:54,440 --> 00:48:56,360
Seriously.

567
00:49:00,310 --> 00:49:04,500
I can't live being all jumpy because of Lawyer Kwon.

568
00:49:04,500 --> 00:49:06,940
I'm all jumpy.

569
00:49:06,940 --> 00:49:11,220
Won't he insist on taking Park Soo Myeong's case at this rate?

570
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:13,310
Eyy.  No way.

571
00:49:13,310 --> 00:49:16,050
Oh, I'm so confused.

572
00:49:16,050 --> 00:49:18,250
- I'm back!
- You're here?

573
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:21,640
Lawyer Dan, did the trial go well?

574
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:25,150
Yes. Well...

575
00:49:25,150 --> 00:49:29,380
But it seemed Oh Yoon Seo was going to be shooting a drama in front of the courthouse.

576
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:35,080
It said in front it was the set for "Love is a Painful Law."

577
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:39,570
Yes, hello? This is Lawyer Dan Moon Hui.

578
00:49:39,570 --> 00:49:43,410
It would be really fun if we all went to the filming site together. Shall we try going once?

579
00:49:43,410 --> 00:49:47,540
Hae Yeong.  With the CEO all worried and upset,

580
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:51,580
do you feel we should be going together to the set where they are filming?  That's not so.

581
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:56,520
That's right.  You're so nervous, you're not in a situation to be doing that.

582
00:49:56,520 --> 00:50:00,440
That's right. This isn't the situation for me to be doing that.

583
00:50:00,440 --> 00:50:02,430
Whatever.

584
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:06,870
 Courthouse 

585
00:50:06,870 --> 00:50:10,740
Wait, you said that we should go eat lunch, so why are we at the courthouse?

586
00:50:10,740 --> 00:50:17,240
Why do you think? I'm thinking we should eat lunch at the courthouse cafeteria today.

587
00:50:17,240 --> 00:50:21,250
This cafeteria is very famous.

588
00:50:21,250 --> 00:50:23,120
What? This is my first time hearing that.

589
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:26,090
Well, it's fine since you've at least heard it right now.

590
00:50:26,090 --> 00:50:29,000
All of the cases that I've won up until now

591
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:35,210
were after I ate the delicious food at the cafeteria here and received good energy from it.

592
00:50:36,510 --> 00:50:40,370
Mr. CEO, did you come because you wanted to see the filming site?

593
00:50:40,370 --> 00:50:42,440
Yeah. What?

594
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:44,280
Don't you mean, "Yeah. That's right"?

595
00:50:44,280 --> 00:50:46,750
Yeah, no. No.

596
00:50:46,750 --> 00:50:49,510
No, well, rather than saying that I came to see the filming site,

597
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:53,940
I thought that it wasn't a bad idea to take a little look at it since we're here anyway. It doesn't mean anything else.

598
00:50:53,940 --> 00:50:59,030
I was an employee here before.  I thought it would be rude to just pass by.

599
00:50:59,930 --> 00:51:04,030
And the other day you two said you want to see Yoon Seo, didn't you?

600
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:09,910
So I'll  humbly sacrifice myself a  bit for the staff.

601
00:51:09,910 --> 00:51:12,590
But where is our Yoon Seo?

602
00:51:12,590 --> 00:51:15,860
- Ah, I'm sorry, but you can't come too close.
 - Ah, yes.

603
00:51:15,860 --> 00:51:18,180
- You could get caught in the camera angle.
 - Ah, yes, yes.

604
00:51:18,180 --> 00:51:20,920
The camera, the camera. Ah, I understand.

605
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,210
But we're not just pedestrians passing by.

606
00:51:25,890 --> 00:51:29,410
We know Oh Yoon Seo very well.

607
00:51:30,070 --> 00:51:36,120
Ah, yes. Well, everyone who is a citizen of Korea knows about Yoon Seo very well.

608
00:51:36,120 --> 00:51:39,440
We'll start filming soon, so please cooperate well with us.

609
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:41,190
Let's just go, CEO.

610
00:51:41,190 --> 00:51:43,570
- Secretary Yang. 
 - It's under control.

611
00:51:43,570 --> 00:51:49,780
Do I have to tell you here I am the Cataclysm, the CEO of Always Law Firm?

612
00:51:50,570 --> 00:51:53,900
This person may not know me very well, so how flustered must he feel?

613
00:51:53,900 --> 00:51:55,520
No, that's not it—

614
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:58,800
Ah, forget it, stop it. Stop it.

615
00:51:58,800 --> 00:52:02,410
I don't see it like that. Our secretary Yang is not that reticent.

616
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:07,050
On top of that, I'm going to be on the terrestrial debate program and I have a great deal of broadcasting experience.

617
00:52:07,050 --> 00:52:11,280
I think she would say that I'm a very prominent attorney.

618
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:19,170
I'll come out and say that the law firm that Yoon Seo went to is our law firm.

619
00:52:21,810 --> 00:52:23,770
Mr. CEO!

620
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:32,230
 Yoon Seo is... Yoon Seo is running toward me. 

621
00:52:32,230 --> 00:52:34,520
 She called out to me. 

622
00:52:37,090 --> 00:52:40,700
Secretary Yang! Hae Young!

623
00:52:40,700 --> 00:52:45,780
How did you come here? I missed you so much! It's so good to see you, really!

624
00:52:45,780 --> 00:52:47,780
Me, too.

625
00:52:47,780 --> 00:52:51,370
What are the three of you doing here?

626
00:52:51,370 --> 00:52:54,620
From time to time I walk in front of the courthouse like this.

627
00:52:54,620 --> 00:52:59,710
When you are a lawyer fighting on the side of the weak, you come to affirm your first resolution.

628
00:52:59,710 --> 00:53:01,930
Today was a day like that.

629
00:53:01,930 --> 00:53:04,130
Today was that kind of day?

630
00:53:04,130 --> 00:53:05,670
Today is that kind of day.

631
00:53:05,670 --> 00:53:09,670
Anyway, this turned out well. The filming has been delayed, so I have a little bit of time.

632
00:53:09,670 --> 00:53:13,610
You haven't eaten lunch yet, have you? Shall we eat lunch together?

633
00:53:19,410 --> 00:53:22,540
Why are you staring at me like that instead of eating?

634
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:27,190
- Because it's fascinating. Shall I say it suddenly feels like I'm eating with a celebrity?
 - Huh?

635
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:32,650
When I saw you at the filming site earlier, I also had the sudden thought that you're a celebrity.

636
00:53:32,650 --> 00:53:37,400
I also thought that it hadn't been that long since you'd been chatting with us so familiarly.

637
00:53:37,400 --> 00:53:41,370
But please don't treat me so unfamiliarly. It makes me feel distant from you.

638
00:53:41,370 --> 00:53:45,720
- I missed my law firm family so much. 
- Really?

639
00:53:46,620 --> 00:53:49,610
- You even missed us?
 - Yes.

640
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,600
I predicted that my empty spot would be extremely noticeable, but it's a little embarrassing to hear it said like this.

641
00:53:56,600 --> 00:54:00,230
- Mr. CEO, you haven't changed a bit. 
- Yes.

642
00:54:01,210 --> 00:54:04,360
Everyone else is doing well, right?

643
00:54:04,360 --> 00:54:09,900
Lawyer Choi and Lawyer Dan seem to both be busy dating others,

644
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:13,990
and the office manager is still full of sensitivity.

645
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:19,100
Lawyer Kwon is doing well too, right?

646
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:25,560
How is he doing well? I'm so uneasy feeling like he's going to cause an accident.

647
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:31,180
He came to me saying that he would take on Park Soo Myeong's case.

648
00:54:31,180 --> 00:54:35,740
What? Park Soo Myeong...

649
00:54:48,470 --> 00:54:53,470
  Mr. Lawyer, are you doing well? 

650
00:54:53,470 --> 00:54:58,020
 I just got in touch with you because I thought of you... 

651
00:55:09,990 --> 00:55:12,670
 Prison 

652
00:55:15,810 --> 00:55:19,140
Do you remember me?

653
00:55:20,920 --> 00:55:22,710
Yes, I remember you.

654
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:26,650
Your mother came to find me.

655
00:55:26,650 --> 00:55:29,660
She asked me to help you, Park Soo Myeong.

656
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:36,140
So, I hope that you'll answer my questions as you think of the answer.

657
00:55:36,140 --> 00:55:38,530
Yes, I will answer.

658
00:55:38,530 --> 00:55:43,740
She said that you only stabbed Im Yoon Hui's husband once.

659
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:45,850
Is that true?

660
00:55:45,850 --> 00:55:49,860
That's right. I stabbed him one time.

661
00:55:49,860 --> 00:55:55,590
That man hit Noona every day, so I got really mad and stabbed him.

662
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:01,920
Noona told me to run away. I listened to what Noona said, so I ran away.

663
00:56:04,700 --> 00:56:07,240
But what about my mom?

664
00:56:08,150 --> 00:56:12,180
Mom is suffering a lot. I have to help Mom.

665
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:15,780
I have to help my mom. I have to make deliveries.

666
00:56:15,780 --> 00:56:21,030
My Mom... I hope my mom isn't suffering.

667
00:56:21,030 --> 00:56:26,140
I really stabbed him once. I stabbed him once.

668
00:56:26,140 --> 00:56:30,230
I only stabbed him once. I stabbed him once.

669
00:56:56,500 --> 00:56:59,170
Lawyer Kwon, are you really crazy?

670
00:56:59,170 --> 00:57:03,450
So you're saying that you're going to have to take on Park Soo Myeong's case no matter what?

671
00:57:05,530 --> 00:57:07,010
Yes.

672
00:57:09,450 --> 00:57:13,530
Alright, let's say that I give in one hundred times

673
00:57:13,530 --> 00:57:16,080
and there's a true culprit besides Park Soo Myeong as you said.

674
00:57:16,080 --> 00:57:19,370
Then you'll be the one to get hurt because you caught someone needlessly.

675
00:57:19,370 --> 00:57:23,250
Inversely, let's say that Park Soo Myeong is the true criminal.

676
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:27,750
Then you'll still be hurt, because you picked out a culprit without being certain.

677
00:57:27,750 --> 00:57:31,200
So people will wonder why you're coming forward saying you'll defend him now after all this time.

678
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:36,770
I'm saying that people are that easy, just like the flip of a hand.

679
00:57:36,770 --> 00:57:39,350
I'm saying that this is a problem that could break people's trust in you as a lawyer.

680
00:57:39,350 --> 00:57:41,640
I've already decided to take it on.

681
00:57:42,460 --> 00:57:45,020
I filed a notice of my appearance as attorney at court.

682
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:46,660
What?

683
00:57:48,690 --> 00:57:51,500
- I'm sorry.
 - You're sorry?

684
00:57:53,620 --> 00:57:55,620
You did this knowing it's something to be sorry for?

685
00:57:55,620 --> 00:57:59,250
I'm asking why you made such an important decision yourself.

686
00:57:59,250 --> 00:58:03,480
Because I knew that you would oppose me to the end like this, I had no other choice.

687
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,030
Since I've been so good to you and complimented you so much, you find what I say laughable, don't you?

688
00:58:07,030 --> 00:58:09,560
- CEO.
 - CEO?

689
00:58:10,150 --> 00:58:12,540
Do you even view me as a CEO?

690
00:58:12,540 --> 00:58:18,590
Lawyer Kwon. Jeong Rok, everyone in the world will point their fingers at you now.

691
00:58:18,590 --> 00:58:20,380
Do you think anyone will stand on your side?

692
00:58:20,380 --> 00:58:23,100
You made a person into a criminal uselessly, and now after all this time,

693
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,180
you're going to end up acknowledging that it was your mistake and your error?

694
00:58:26,180 --> 00:58:29,570
I have to acknowledge it because it  was  my mistake!

695
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:34,480
It's late, but I want to set it right even if it's now.

696
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,170
Alright. You're the only great one here.

697
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:40,410
Right now, there's no one in the world who will recognize

698
00:58:40,410 --> 00:58:42,360
your sense of fairness and your good intentions!

699
00:58:42,360 --> 00:58:44,460
You're just branding yourself with the stigma

700
00:58:44,460 --> 00:58:47,050
of being a lawyer who put on a show at a trial.

701
00:58:48,790 --> 00:58:51,350
As I said, that's something I'll have to endure for—

702
00:58:51,350 --> 00:58:54,380
Then the law firm? What about your Always members?

703
00:58:54,380 --> 00:58:56,940
Does it not matter to you if Always Law Firm gets badmouthed just because of you?

704
00:58:56,940 --> 00:59:01,720
If you have at least a basic sense of belonging or a feeling of duty to Always,

705
00:59:01,720 --> 00:59:04,030
you shouldn't do this to me.

706
00:59:04,650 --> 00:59:07,020
I'm saying you shouldn't do this to me.

707
00:59:28,040 --> 00:59:32,140
I heard you submitted a notice of appearance as the attorney in the Park Soo Myeong case.

708
00:59:32,140 --> 00:59:34,860
- What happened? 
 - It happened that way.

709
00:59:34,860 --> 00:59:39,310
Jeez, you too?   The risk is greater than you think.

710
00:59:39,310 --> 00:59:41,780
Did you really have to go that far?

711
01:00:01,120 --> 01:00:03,570
Actually, I'm also afraid.

712
01:00:05,260 --> 01:00:08,250
Although I still don't know the truth,

713
01:00:08,250 --> 01:00:14,240
I am afraid my hasty judgment has put someone into a bind.

714
01:00:16,830 --> 01:00:18,460
I...

715
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:26,950
I am afraid I created a permanent grudge in someone's heart.

716
01:00:33,360 --> 01:00:35,770
I'm also afraid.

717
01:00:35,770 --> 01:00:40,610
But ... if I turn away from the truth

718
01:00:42,300 --> 01:00:45,670
and miss the chance to resolve it,

719
01:00:49,840 --> 01:00:53,680
I won't be qualified to be anyone's lawyer in the future.

720
01:00:55,230 --> 01:00:59,120
I don't think I would have the confidence to  be able to do it.

721
01:01:38,320 --> 01:01:39,660
 The picture turned out well, didn't it? 

722
01:01:39,660 --> 01:01:43,110
 Come to the law firm next time, Yoon Seo. 

723
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:52,750
 By the way, in the end Lawyer Kwon decided to take the Park Soo Myeong case. 

724
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:55,450
 That's why the CEO and Lawyer Kwon had a big fight. 

725
01:01:55,450 --> 01:01:57,440
 The atmosphere is so hostile. 

726
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:59,590
 And he doesn't have secretarial support now. 

727
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,940
 Lawyer Kwon is in a tight spot. 

728
01:02:12,970 --> 01:02:16,330
What?  Attorney Kwon took on the Park Soo Myeong appeal?

729
01:02:16,330 --> 01:02:19,280
Yes, that's what I heard.

730
01:02:19,330 --> 01:02:21,010
Jeez.

731
01:02:21,550 --> 01:02:25,290
After suddenly pointing him out as the culprit, you let your guard down,

732
01:02:25,290 --> 01:02:28,130
and he says he's going to defend him?

733
01:02:32,020 --> 01:02:34,850
He's a funny guy.

734
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:44,680
Prosecutor Im, I'm a reporter from the Korea Daily.

735
01:02:44,680 --> 01:02:49,830
Is it true that Park Soo Myeong  is preparing to appeal?

736
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:55,220
I can't say. Well.  I don't think an appeal will make any difference.

737
01:02:59,850 --> 01:03:03,000
I heard an interesting story.

738
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:08,100
Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok!

739
01:03:08,100 --> 01:03:09,790
After arguing that Park Soo Myeong was the real culprit,

740
01:03:09,790 --> 01:03:11,350
why have you changed your mind?

741
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:15,340
If that is so, then an innocent person is unfairly in prison. Don't you feel guilty?

742
01:03:15,340 --> 01:03:18,430
There is a claim you violated the Attorneys' Ethics Code. What do you think?

743
01:03:18,430 --> 01:03:20,670
Is it true you were in charge of the money?

744
01:03:20,670 --> 01:03:22,810
 Replacing the client he was defending 

745
01:03:22,810 --> 01:03:26,360
 the lawyer who was again representing the victim of the crime, 

746
01:03:26,360 --> 01:03:29,880
 entered a plea of not guilty. What do you think? 

747
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,340
 Under Article 22 of the Attorneys' Code of Ethics, 

748
01:03:32,340 --> 01:03:36,260
 when the interest of two or more clients in the same case conflict, 

749
01:03:36,260 --> 01:03:38,100
 the lawyer must decline representation. 

750
01:03:38,100 --> 01:03:40,310
In short, it's very wrong to accept representation.

751
01:03:40,310 --> 01:03:42,860
 If you look within in the profession, it would be very difficult to find. 

752
01:03:42,860 --> 01:03:44,370
 I think the lawyer ... 

753
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:46,410
What's going to happen, Oppa?

754
01:03:46,410 --> 01:03:49,230
Yes. Public opinion is very low.

755
01:03:49,230 --> 01:03:53,130
 We're convening the standing board meeting. It's something we will have to discuss. 

756
01:03:53,130 --> 01:03:56,420
I'm sure you're upset.  Let's stop watching, Yoon Seo.

757
01:03:58,340 --> 01:04:04,450
When I've been in trouble, he's always been there for me.

758
01:04:22,960 --> 01:04:25,430
 Mr. Lawyer. 

759
01:04:28,470 --> 01:04:32,500
 Don't pay too much attention to what other people say. 

760
01:04:32,500 --> 01:04:36,590
 I believe you will win the case. 

761

♫  With the door locked tight  ♫

762

01:05:24,640 --> 01:05:29,570
 How are you? 

769
01:05:29,570 --> 01:05:33,090
 I thought of the wish that I wanted to say. 

770
01:05:33,090 --> 01:05:37,870
 My wish is that you will remain steadfast. 

771
01:05:37,870 --> 01:05:43,550
 As you alway have done until now,  I believe you will do a great job. 

772
01:05:44,550 --> 01:05:47,720
♫  Because of my foolish pride  ♫

773
01:05:47,720 --> 01:05:51,120
♫  Only a deeper would was left.  ♫

774
01:05:51,120 --> 01:05:55,170
♫   I'm sorry.  Why was it then  ♫

775
01:05:55,220 --> 01:05:57,330
♫  Why did I only know myself?  ♫

776
01:05:57,330 --> 01:06:01,010
♫  Photographs in my hand  ♫

777
01:06:01,010 --> 01:06:03,820
♫  You who are in my hand  ♫

778

785
01:06:46,440 --> 01:06:49,410
♫  Just like you're still around  ♫

01:07:48,870 --> 01:07:50,830
♫  Why did I only know myself?  ♫

794
01:07:50,830 --> 01:07:53,990
♫  Photographs which are in my hand  ♫

795
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:57,010
♫  You who are only smiling in them  ♫

796
01:07:57,010 --> 01:08:01,060
♫  You will never return again  ♫

802
01:08:25,670 --> 01:08:27,880
 I could have ruined someone's life. 

803
01:08:27,880 --> 01:08:30,740
 We have to somehow get it back. 
 I'm resigning. 

804
01:08:30,740 --> 01:08:33,000
 Do as you please! I don't need an irresponsible person like you 

805
01:08:33,000 --> 01:08:35,080
  anymore. So do as you please. 

806
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,740
 No, you're not middle school students.  You're grown men. Why are you fighting each other? 

807
01:08:38,740 --> 01:08:40,740
 Are you going to work now, Mr. Lawyer? 

808
01:08:40,740 --> 01:08:43,150
 If I want to see you, I'll come to see you. 

809
01:08:43,150 --> 01:08:45,650
 Mr. Lawyer, would you like to have dinner with me? 

810
01:08:45,650 --> 01:08:47,390
 Seriously, what's wrong with you? 

811
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:48,780
 It's just saving one person. 

812
01:08:48,780 --> 01:08:52,770
 Who is that? It's our Lawyer Kwon's right to hate people. 

813
01:08:52,770 --> 01:08:56,510
 My wish is for you to remain steadfast. 

814
01:08:56,510 --> 01:09:00,310
 I believe you're going to do a great job.
