1
00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:04,010


2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:08,570
 She's Gone!
 Yoon Seo Oh! 

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,480
 What has actress Oh Yoon Seo been up to lately? 

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:16,210
 CALL 

5
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,350
 TOUCH YOUR HEART 

6
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:40,930
 Touch Your Heart 

7
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:46,310
Rather than losing another chance because of a scandal,

8
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:49,760
I'm more scared of you disappearing from my side, Mr. Lawyer.

9
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:52,010
So,

10
00:00:53,230 --> 00:00:56,260
let's start over.

11
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:04,420
Are you really not going to hold onto me, even if I'm doing this?

12
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:10,530
If we leave it like this

13
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:14,960
even if we can't see each other permanently?

14
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,780
Oh Jin Sim.

15
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:50,260
I love you.

16
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:24,640
 Episode 15 

17
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:30,270
We're already here.

18
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,120
Why is it so close?

19
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:40,600
I don't want to go home today.

20
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,960
I want to continue to see you.

21
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:49,660
Actually, I feel the same.

22
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,270
Can I watch you fall asleep before I leave?

23
00:03:09,370 --> 00:03:11,970
I don't fall asleep easily.

24
00:03:11,970 --> 00:03:16,310
That's even better because I can look at you for a long, long time.

25
00:03:16,310 --> 00:03:20,740
All this time, I haven't really been bothered by insomnia.

26
00:03:20,740 --> 00:03:25,230
But after I broke up with you,

27
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:28,340
it was a little difficult.

28
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:33,640
Because I was thinking of you on those long, long sleepless nights.

29
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:40,540
Mr. Lawyer, when was the hardest time for you?

30
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:45,120
Ah, never mind. You weren't affected at all since you were so busy, right?

31
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:48,740
Who said that I wasn't affected?

32
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:52,410
I also had a really hard time every morning and every night.

33
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:55,630
Even when I was working and standing in court,

34
00:03:55,630 --> 00:03:58,710
every single moment was difficult.

35
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,640
Really? Was it really that difficult for you?

36
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:05,480
Wait, is me going through a hard time something to be so happy about?

37
00:04:05,530 --> 00:04:10,470
Of course, it is since that means you like me that much.

38
00:04:10,520 --> 00:04:14,620
Strangely, it puts me at ease.

39
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:27,480
Let's never break up again.

40
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:33,310
Promise me that you won't let go of this hand that you're holding right now.

41
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:38,300
Yes, I promise.

42
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:42,370
I will never let you go.

43
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,860
And, I will protect you, Oh Jin Sim.

44
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:53,520
The reason that I ended up leaving you

45
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:59,200
was because right now is such an important time for you, so  I didn't want to interfere with that.

46
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,730
My thoughts on that haven't changed even now.

47
00:05:01,730 --> 00:05:04,840
So, even if it's just to protect you,

48
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:08,510
I think we need to secretly date more carefully from now on.

49
00:05:08,510 --> 00:05:11,610
Secretly date more carefully?

50
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:15,170
Yes. We can't have our picture taken like we did last time,

51
00:05:15,220 --> 00:05:17,900
so from now we need to refrain from meeting outside

52
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:24,300
and meet only in enclosed places like here,  your house, or mine.

53
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:31,380
Secluded places?

54
00:05:31,430 --> 00:05:33,510
Yes.

55
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:38,600
Secret and quiet places with only us two.

56
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:50,670
Can I sleep over today?

57
00:06:05,110 --> 00:06:07,520
I'll make sure not to cross this line.

58
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,250
Didn't I tell you that I would make sure to protect you?

59
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,130
Yes, well...

60
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,200
Thank you  so  much for protecting me.

61
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:04,750
 HEIGHTS MANSION 

62
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:15,040
- Good morning, Mr. Lawyer.
 - Yes, good morning.

63
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,390
But you must have been uncomfortable wearing that all night.

64
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:22,520
I'm fine. How is your schedule for today?

65
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,370
Today is pretty empty.

66
00:07:24,370 --> 00:07:28,840
I'll start filming around one o'clock and be done around seven.

67
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,440
Ah. Then we'll be able to eat dinner together.

68
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:35,450
- I'll call you as soon as I'm done.
 - Okay.

69
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,290
Who's here so early in the morning?

70
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:44,140
It's my manager! What should we do?

71
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,090
- Yoon Seo!
 - If he sees us together so early in the morning,

72
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:48,340
he'll have weird thoughts!

73
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,540
If you keep quiet as though nobody is here, won't it be okay?

74
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:56,950
No. He knows my passcode. If I don't answer, he'll probably put it in and come in. What should we do?

75
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:01,700
Why does he have your passcode? Even if he is your manager, it's your personal life.

76
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,370
Just hide here for right now.

77
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:12,550
Oh Jin Sim!

78
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,840
What's going on? You were up!

79
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,470
You didn't open the door, so I thought you were sleeping.

80
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:26,660
Ah, that's... I was using the mixer,

81
00:08:26,660 --> 00:08:29,450
so I didn't hear the doorbell.

82
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,950
But why are you here so early in the morning? Doesn't my appointment start at one o'clock?

83
00:08:34,950 --> 00:08:36,940
Ah, they just got in touch with me saying that your schedule suddenly changed.

84
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:39,790
The filming starts at eleven, so we've got to hurry up and leave.

85
00:08:39,790 --> 00:08:41,760
Ah, I see.

86
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,420
Then I'll get ready really quickly and come out.

87
00:08:44,420 --> 00:08:46,960
Oppa, go to the car and wait. I'll be right out.

88
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:49,420
- Alright, hurry and come out.
 - Okay.

89
00:08:52,530 --> 00:08:55,990
Ah, that's right. Yoon Seo, I'll use the bathroom really quick.

90
00:08:57,900 --> 00:09:00,350
Oppa!

91
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:01,540
What?

92
00:09:01,540 --> 00:09:04,770
I'm sorry, but can you not go to the bathroom?

93
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:06,540
- Wait, why?
 - Huh?

94
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,530
Well, that is, just ... so ...

95
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:14,470
Hey, Yoon Seo. I'm sorry, but I feel right now like my bladders going to burst, so I'm going to pee.

96
00:09:14,470 --> 00:09:15,820
- No, Oppa. That is 
 - No.

97
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:18,950
Oppa. Oppa. I have to pee!

98
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,900
Yoon Seo, how long are you going to stand there?

99
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,980
Huh? Oh, sorry, Oppa.

100
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:36,940
Are you?  Are you sorry to my bladder?  Hurry and leave!

101
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,930
- Yeah.
 - Hurry.

102
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:19,670
Who is it?!

103
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:22,260
Huh? Mr. Lawyer!

104
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:27,100
Ah, yes? A prosecutor's investigation?

105
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,820
Excuse me.

106
00:10:35,290 --> 00:10:37,680
I'm not like that!

107
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:43,480
Mr. Lawyer!

108
00:10:46,730 --> 00:10:50,620
I'm okay. I was planning to take a shower anyway.

109
00:10:52,270 --> 00:10:55,050
Oh, no.

110
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:01,300
Still, it's a relief that Oppa had these clothes in his car.

111
00:11:03,370 --> 00:11:05,610
I will make sure I wash the clothes and give them back to you.

112
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:07,810
But what happened?

113
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,590
Why are you here so early in the morning?

114
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:16,400
Did you possibly  sleep here?

115
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,440
- Yes.
 - No!

116
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,730
Yes and no? Yes and no!

117
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:24,680
Hey, I can tell the answer right away. Wait, Mr. Lawyer. It's true that I've decided to acknowledge your relationship,

118
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,900
but honestly isn't this not right?

119
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,250
Oppa!

120
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:31,130
Mr. Lawyer, you can leave now.

121
00:11:31,130 --> 00:11:33,370
You'll be tight on time since you need to go home and then go to work.

122
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,570
Hurry up and go.

123
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:42,100
Mr. Lawyer! I'm not done talking—

124
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:45,730
What am I going to do with her?

125
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,040
Goodbye.

126
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,010
I'll leave now.

127
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:16,130
Oppa! How can you talk like that

128
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:18,630
when Mr. Lawyer got struck by water because of you?

129
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,290
Yoon Seo.

130
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:24,380
Lawyer Kwon got struck by water, but I got struck by lightning!

131
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:28,460
How can you invite Lawyer Kwon to your place when you haven't been dating for that long?

132
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:32,870
Well— T-Then, you want us to be out on the streets, where we can get our pictures taken?

133
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:37,720
Even if your pictures are taken outside, then I'll find a way to explain it.

134
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:41,450
But, if a picture of you two leaving the house gets taken, then it's a dead end!

135
00:12:41,450 --> 00:12:45,240
We'll figure it out! We are doing our best to not get caught!

136
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,240
Oppa, you said you were going to close your eyes on us dating, so just close your eyes!

137
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,310
Pretend you didn't see it!

138
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,560
I also want to do that,

139
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:01,360
but I'm worried you'll get caught.

140
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,940
I can accept you dating, but we can't admit it.

141
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,180
This is driving me crazy.

142
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,060
What are you looking at, you hedgehog?!

143
00:13:18,790 --> 00:13:20,400
What?

144
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:25,280
What's with you? I didn't see you this morning, where did you go?

145
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:28,210
Did you go play soccer?

146
00:13:28,210 --> 00:13:32,100
Singilsam-dong Neighborhood Early Soccer Society?

147
00:13:32,790 --> 00:13:36,010
Why did you play so far away?

148
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:39,420
They are good there, right? Next time, I'll go with you.

149
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,820
It's a place you can't ever go to.

150
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:47,020
Why? What?  Is it difficult to get in?

151
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:49,140
I'm good.

152
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:53,130
Just... Just know that you won't be able to go there.

153
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:59,730
What's wrong with him? How good is he at soccer that he's showing off?

154
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,470
 Singilsam-dong Neighborhood Early Soccer Society 

155
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:18,210
I'm doing all sort of things while living.

156
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:33,310
 I finish at around 7 p.m. I am requesting to see you since I miss you. 

157
00:14:33,310 --> 00:14:35,400
 Are you done filming? 

158
00:14:36,420 --> 00:14:40,730
 It looks like I'm almost done. Should we eat dinner together? 

159
00:14:40,730 --> 00:14:42,280
 Sounds good. 

160
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:46,070
 Then, I'll meet you at my place. 

161
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,670
 I won't get struck by water again, will I? 

162
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:54,090
 Of course not. The moment I get home, I'll change the passcode. 

163
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:59,750
 Then, I'll go buy the sushi that you like. 

164
00:15:12,750 --> 00:15:14,020
Yes, Oh Jin Sim.

165
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,400
- I'm— 
 -  What to do? 

166
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:18,570
 They just added an additional scene, so it'll be late when I finish. 

167
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:22,170
 I don't think we'll be able to meet today. 

168
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:25,030
Yes, well there's nothing we can do about that.

169
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:27,950
 You didn't buy the sushi yet, right? 

170
00:15:27,950 --> 00:15:31,720
No, I haven't bought it yet.

171
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:35,000
Don't worry about me and do well on your filming.

172
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,650
Yes, then.

173
00:15:56,610 --> 00:15:58,990
I'm here!

174
00:16:02,640 --> 00:16:05,620
What the heck? Why are you eating two by yourself?

175
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,590
One of them is for me, right?

176
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,010
I didn't buy it for you.

177
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,150
Then, who did you buy it for?

178
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,550
I bought the two of them for me. Why?

179
00:16:14,550 --> 00:16:16,830
You are really selfish.

180
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:19,740
You also went to play with that good soccer team by yourself.

181
00:16:19,740 --> 00:16:22,860
You bought two of the same sushi to eat by yourself—

182
00:16:22,910 --> 00:16:25,760
- Why did you change so much? 
 - That's not it.

183
00:16:27,030 --> 00:16:32,360
From now on, I'll teach you how to share food.

184
00:16:34,030 --> 00:16:38,510
Look at me and learn. That's how you live with someone.

185
00:16:42,730 --> 00:16:44,610
That's right.

186
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:46,620
Eat a lot.

187
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:50,690
You suddenly told me you had something for me to do. What are you going to say?

188
00:16:50,690 --> 00:16:54,490
It's nothing much, but our company's actors

189
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,560
have gotten many more global contracts with their international promotions.

190
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:02,800
So, I thought we should also find a company law firm.

191
00:17:05,930 --> 00:17:08,440
So, you want to join hands with us?

192
00:17:08,440 --> 00:17:13,010
I don't know. I get what you mean, but I don't know if it'll go your way.

193
00:17:13,010 --> 00:17:13,840
What?

194
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:20,050
You know about this too, right? The biggest issue these days is Im Yoon Hui's case. Who solved it?

195
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:23,110
Our Always law firm.

196
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:27,210
This Hyung likes to say things as he pleases. You should say it properly.

197
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:31,140
Always didn't figure it out, Kwon Jeong Rok did. He's rude but at least he is talented.

198
00:17:31,140 --> 00:17:36,860
Anyway, these days, our law firm is really hot.

199
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:41,000
So, I, who am leading the company am even hotter!

200
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,500
Broadcasting stations, magazines companies, now are all saying they want to interview me. It's very hectic.

201
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,470
We get phone calls non-stop.

202
00:17:48,470 --> 00:17:50,800
So, you're saying you won't do it?

203
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:52,830
I never said so.

204
00:17:52,830 --> 00:17:57,360
I'm just telling you that it might not be possible.

205
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:01,020
Ah, it's a shame that the conditions are not right. It's a shame.

206
00:18:01,020 --> 00:18:05,210
If you become a family with us, you'll be at year-end parties with

207
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:08,060
our actors and artists. Cheers!

208
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:13,040
And in the summer, at Waikiki Beach, at our summer camp, playing beach volleyball.

209
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:18,420
Ah, toss! My ball! We could've all met there.

210
00:18:18,420 --> 00:18:21,220
It's a shame. You can leave now.

211
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:27,230
Joon Seok, Joon Seok, Joon Seok! My little cousin Joon Seok!

212
00:18:27,230 --> 00:18:30,270
Why can't you get a joke?

213
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:33,060
Did you think that I wouldn't grant a request my little cousin asked for?

214
00:18:33,060 --> 00:18:36,510
You're so gullible. How are you going to survive in society?

215
00:18:36,510 --> 00:18:38,310
Bring it over now, I'll stamp it for you immediately.

216
00:18:38,310 --> 00:18:42,010
Aigoo, our Hyung! Hyung! Aigoo.

217
00:18:42,060 --> 00:18:47,910
And, Yoon Seo's drama team is asking for a lawyer consultant.

218
00:18:47,910 --> 00:18:48,960
A lawyer consultant.

219
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:51,300
Well, you know the lawyer who is on set,

220
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,710
and advises on whether the legal terms are rightfully used or not.

221
00:18:54,710 --> 00:18:58,360
They told me to find a lawyer that Yoon Seo is comfortable with.

222
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,130
I'll help her. You have me.

223
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:04,950
- Ah, Hyung, you were also a lawyer! 
 - I  am  a lawyer.

224
00:19:04,950 --> 00:19:07,590
It's a shame.

225
00:19:07,590 --> 00:19:11,550
Hyung, the conditions are not right, it's a shame. I should look for someone else.

226
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:14,400
Ah, this little cutie. I'll do it.

227
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,200
No, Hyung, you're making me anxious.

228
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:19,140
If you go on set, you'll get excited seeing celebrities.

229
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:23,970
And you'll make gifs out of them. Get someone else to do it.

230
00:19:23,970 --> 00:19:26,010
Nobody will want to do it.

231
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:29,330
A lawyer consultant?

232
00:19:29,330 --> 00:19:34,090
Nobody wants to do it, right? It's tiring, troublesome, and time wasting. It's so-so, right?

233
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:35,670
Yes, well.

234
00:19:35,670 --> 00:19:38,150
Well, I have many cases these days.

235
00:19:38,150 --> 00:19:42,970
If I go on set for nothing I'm afraid I'll get streetcast by the management  agency.

236
00:19:42,970 --> 00:19:46,070
It's too much a burden so count me out.

237
00:19:46,070 --> 00:19:49,500
Okay, then I'll go.

238
00:19:49,500 --> 00:19:53,880
CEO, are you happy? If you go on set, you'll see Yoon Seo more often.

239
00:19:53,890 --> 00:19:56,740
Well, I will see her a lot.

240
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:01,340
They want someone today, so I'll conclude this by going.

241
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:03,200
No.

242
00:20:04,360 --> 00:20:06,600
I'll do it!

243
00:20:11,030 --> 00:20:16,690
I think I heard things. Lawyer Kwon, can you tell me once more?

244
00:20:16,690 --> 00:20:19,630
I said I will be the lawyer consultant.

245
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,250
Lawyer Kwon, you dislike this usually.

246
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:32,320
Well, I thought it wouldn't be that bad as an experience.

247
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:39,310
Lawyer Kwon, when someone does something they usually don't, they die.

248
00:20:39,310 --> 00:20:44,320
So, as usual, mind your own business and fight for justice.

249
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,580
No, I want to be the lawyer consultant.

250
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:48,740
What's wrong with you? You're being annoying.

251
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:53,210
Lawyer Kwon, did you catch the celebrity disease by doing the interview for Park Soo Myeong's case a few days ago?

252
00:20:53,210 --> 00:20:55,370
Why are you throwing a fit?

253
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:58,550
A fit? If you were going to be like this, why did you ask for volunteers?

254
00:20:58,550 --> 00:21:00,250
Forget it, let's vote then.

255
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:01,730
Vote?

256
00:21:01,730 --> 00:21:06,220
Yes. If that person goes and makes a mistake, then it'll cost Always' name.

257
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:10,060
So, let's decide who will go as Always' representative.

258
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:13,070
Who will defend Always' name?

259
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,760
Let's be democratic and vote to decide.

260
00:21:21,670 --> 00:21:24,660
 Yeon Joon Gyoo: 1 
Kwon Jeong Rok: 4 

261
00:21:28,660 --> 00:21:31,230
Then, I'll be back.

262
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,580
 Oh Jin Sim! Listen to this. 

263
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,870
 We can finally meet! 

264
00:21:52,870 --> 00:21:58,850
 I will be the lawyer consultant on set for your drama to advise— 

265
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,390
No, I should surprise her.

266
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:15,950
Is it because I couldn't see Mr. Lawyer yesterday?

267
00:22:15,950 --> 00:22:20,860
I don't have strength, nor an appetite.

268
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:26,960
I see that you lost your appetite, so you left two pieces of seasoned dried radish.

269
00:22:26,990 --> 00:22:30,170
If someone saw this, they would think you were doing the dishes!

270
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,970
I said I didn't have an appetite, did I say I didn't want to eat a meal?

271
00:22:34,090 --> 00:22:37,670
Yoon Seo, I'm really happy to see you eat well.

272
00:22:37,710 --> 00:22:40,760
I'm really happy, but you should manage yourself.

273
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,790
What are you going to do if your face is swollen on a broadcast?

274
00:22:43,790 --> 00:22:46,320
And, you know you have a pictorial next week, right?

275
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:51,210
Ah, I know. Don't worry, I have a conscience, too!

276
00:22:53,240 --> 00:22:55,700
This is helpful, so I'm drinking this regularly.

277
00:22:55,700 --> 00:23:00,220
Sure, sure. Since you are drinking it, it seems like you are shooting a commercial.

278
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:02,550
Drink more.

279
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:04,240
Chief, can we see you for a moment?

280
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,920
Yes.

281
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:15,550
I miss Mr. Lawyer.

282
00:23:16,280 --> 00:23:19,220
It's really unexpected that Lawyer Kwon would do this.

283
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,570
That's right.

284
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:25,060
It's like a mirage in a desert. Even if you see it, it's hard to believe.

285
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:30,380
Everyone is gathered here. Is it tea time?

286
00:23:30,380 --> 00:23:33,100
It looks delicious.

287
00:23:33,670 --> 00:23:38,840
From now on, I want someone to record our meetings.

288
00:23:38,840 --> 00:23:44,030
Typing on a laptop would be loud, so I want someone to simply write them by hand.

289
00:23:44,030 --> 00:23:45,980
Ah, yes. I'll do it.

290
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:48,940
- Hae Yeong, do you have nice handwriting? 
 - Yes.

291
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:52,840
I hope it's someone who has nice handwriting.

292
00:23:52,840 --> 00:23:56,850
- I... 
 - Just in case, should everyone write something?

293
00:23:56,850 --> 00:24:01,540
Write on the clipboard,  "Meeting Log" here.  "Meeting Log".

294
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,470
Since one of us is going to do it, it's better to do it right.

295
00:24:13,340 --> 00:24:14,980
 Meeting Log 

296
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:22,420
This one, this one! This one!

297
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:25,730
This "Log."

298
00:24:27,820 --> 00:24:30,260
Lawyer Choi, Lawyer Dan, Hae Young, and Secretary Yang,

299
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:33,060
I'm very disappointed in you. I didn't know you were like this.

300
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:37,580
I'm usually so good to you, but you betrayed me and chose Lawyer Kwon?

301
00:24:37,580 --> 00:24:39,480
Wh-What are you saying?

302
00:24:39,480 --> 00:24:44,300
I picked you, CEO. You got one vote and that was from me.

303
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,840
Stop lying.

304
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:50,040
Look, look. This is how you wrote "Kwon Jeong Rok".

305
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,600
If you compare it to "Log," 
 (T/N: Log in Korean is written as Rok) 

306
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:54,930
there's not a "Log" like this here.

307
00:24:54,930 --> 00:24:56,990
That "Log" is not here.

308
00:24:56,990 --> 00:24:59,620
Secretary Yang contemplated a lot.

309
00:24:59,620 --> 00:25:03,250
Oh, you said it was a secret vote. How can you do this?

310
00:25:03,250 --> 00:25:05,370
Who said anything? I was curious, so I wanted to know.

311
00:25:05,370 --> 00:25:08,050
I  didn't say I was going to punish anyone.

312
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:11,190
Why is there suddenly so much dust in the law firm?

313
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:15,540
Let's gather this weekend and do a big clean up.

314
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:20,720
Except for Office Manager. I'll give you a movie ticket, so go watch a movie.

315
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:30,290
- Hello. 
 - Hello.

316
00:25:30,290 --> 00:25:32,360
- You're here? 
 - Hello.

317
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:35,460
Our drama's lawyer consultant is here.

318
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:51,900
Mr. Lawyer, please come here and look at the script.

319
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,750
 Actress' standby room 
(Oh Yoon Seo) 

320
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:59,310
How did you ... How did you come ...

321
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:02,180
You are our drama's lawyer consultant?

322
00:26:02,180 --> 00:26:05,390
It wasn't easy to be elected as the consultant lawyer.

323
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,300
Elected?

324
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:09,160
Yes. Our CEO, who loves to leak information to the media,

325
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:13,860
wanted to become your drama's lawyer consultant. Wasn't that too ambitious?

326
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:16,520
Because I was determined to see you,

327
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,790
I endured all sorts of criticism from the CEO and tried to appease him.

328
00:26:18,790 --> 00:26:23,310
In the end, through a democratic vote of 4 against 1,

329
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:29,200
I,  precisely me, was elected to be your drama's lawyer consultant.

330
00:26:30,940 --> 00:26:34,970
Even now when I think about it, it was a thrilling and breathtaking moment.

331
00:26:35,710 --> 00:26:38,660
Just by listening it is thrilling and breathtaking.

332
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:42,130
Yes. Now that I get to see your face,

333
00:26:42,130 --> 00:26:45,690
I feel like I did a very, very good job.

334
00:26:45,690 --> 00:26:50,090
Since I came suddenly, are you uncomfortable or burdened by it?

335
00:26:50,090 --> 00:26:54,130
Of course not. I'm really happy right now!

336
00:26:54,130 --> 00:26:58,130
I really missed you!

337
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,050
Yoon Seo, you were here!

338
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:06,510
I'm sorry.

339
00:27:06,510 --> 00:27:09,520
How are you? No, Yoon Seo! Oh Yoon Seo!

340
00:27:09,520 --> 00:27:10,620
Yes?

341
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:12,670
We need to film, come out now.

342
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:15,470
Yes, I'll go.

343
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:18,390
- Mr. Lawyer, hurry up and come. 
 - Yes.

344
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:21,730
What's wrong with you?

345
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:27,200
Mr. Lawyer, I understand how you feel,

346
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,970
but you coming here as a lawyer consultant is a little—

347
00:27:29,970 --> 00:27:31,500
Well, it's up to my willingness and my freedom.

348
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,760
I don't know if you are interfering in our relationship by that.

349
00:27:33,760 --> 00:27:39,640
It is a violation of our right to pursue happiness as guaranteed by our Constitution.  Then  ...

350
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,900
Yes.

351
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:46,070
Yoon Seo! Don't go! Don't go with him, let's go together!

352
00:27:46,890 --> 00:27:53,440
Witness, you claimed that you were at home during the day of the incident. Is that correct?

353
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:57,540
Your Honor.

354
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:02,710
Ah, wait a minute. I...

355
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:07,760
Mr. Lawyer, when I say "Your Honor,"

356
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:10,270
what should I do with my hands?

357
00:28:10,270 --> 00:28:14,910
Ah... Yes.

358
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,290
Rather than pointing at the judge,

359
00:28:21,290 --> 00:28:27,690
it's better to put your hands on your side or put your hands together.

360
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,210
Not like this, right?

361
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:33,160
Both hands is very strange. Put your hands to the side...

362
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:39,400
♫  The righteous and honest person there keeps provoking me, right?  ♫

363
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:43,200
Your Honor.
♫  Okay gradually I gain my composure  ♫

364
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,600
Mr. Lawyer, please eat this while resting.
♫  Well... even if it frustrates me  ♫

365
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:51,300
Thank you.
♫  Anytime and anywhere I am with composure  ♫

366
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:56,100
Excuse me, Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok?
♫  Yes, I am stronger, I was surprising  ♫

367
00:28:56,110 --> 00:29:01,790
This part in the script bothers me. Is this how you say it in legal terms? 
♫  (Say) "Hi lovely! We're beautiful"  ♫

368
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:04,700
 Kwon Jeong Rok ♡ 
♫  No matter how we doodley  ♫

369
00:29:04,700 --> 00:29:08,440
♫  It's hard, try saying it more simply  ♫

370
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:11,640
Yes. It is the right term without any error.

371
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:15,410
♫  My sincerity is visible, my feelings are displayed there  ♫

372
00:29:15,410 --> 00:29:19,630
None, none.   Even as I look here, this script is absolutely perfect.

373
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:23,440
So, let's move on to the next scene. Come here, follow me. 
♫  Don't act you like you don't know  ♫

374
00:29:23,440 --> 00:29:25,750
♫  You're going to fall for me  ♫

375
00:29:25,750 --> 00:29:28,640
♫  Hurry now and show yourself to me  ♫

376
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:31,800
♫  Ya, what you gonna do, what you gonna do, woo hoo!  ♫

377
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,810
Lawyer Dan.

378
00:29:53,110 --> 00:29:56,320
Our contract is over, but we are still comrades.

379
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:58,630
Why are you not saying anything to me, nor are you looking at me?

380
00:29:58,630 --> 00:30:03,190
Me? If I did that, I apologize.

381
00:30:03,190 --> 00:30:04,650
Wait a minute.

382
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:10,000
Did it go well with that delivery man that you fell for last time?

383
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:14,930
No, it was simply out of habit since I was drunk. It wasn't my honest feelings.

384
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:19,660
Anyway, I was not able to not flirt with anyone, as per the condition on the contract,

385
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:24,520
so I feel saddened that I voided the contract.

386
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:26,770
Of course, we have to.

387
00:30:26,770 --> 00:30:31,350
I don't know about that. You didn't do anything good either.

388
00:30:31,350 --> 00:30:34,420
You told me that I didn't move your heart.

389
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:39,190
What's the point of being in a contract with someone who doesn't even move your heart?

390
00:30:39,190 --> 00:30:42,620
As for me, I'm drinking water by myself.

391
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:46,550
Then, I'll take my leave.

392
00:30:52,830 --> 00:30:57,750
What is this? When she used to look at me, honey would drip from her eyes.

393
00:30:57,750 --> 00:30:59,870
Now, why is ice dripping out?

394
00:30:59,870 --> 00:31:03,450
How can a person change like that?

395
00:31:03,450 --> 00:31:08,040
Ah, my heart.

396
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,570
Did I go overboard?

397
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:22,240
No, what's the point of having regrets over someone who said I didn't move his heart?

398
00:31:23,810 --> 00:31:25,870
I should fold my feelings.

399
00:31:29,190 --> 00:31:31,210
I don't know the reason

400
00:31:33,870 --> 00:31:38,030
as to why it is feeling empty here. What is this feeling?

401
00:31:49,670 --> 00:31:53,410
Anyway, the contract has been terminated. 
 Dating Contract 

402
00:31:53,980 --> 00:31:56,370
I will forget you cleanly.

403
00:31:58,470 --> 00:32:00,300
Goodbye.

404
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,300
It was a clumsy,

405
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:08,700
but blooming single page of my life.

406
00:32:58,310 --> 00:33:00,310
What's the matter?

407
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:04,270
Just...

408
00:33:07,300 --> 00:33:09,870
I see that you need caffeine this morning,

409
00:33:09,870 --> 00:33:13,610
so you were tired from advising all day yesterday.

410
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:20,060
Of course, you have that many cases assigned to you, yet you also do advising. How can you not be tired?

411
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:25,430
This looks like a face full of regret. Full of regret.

412
00:33:25,430 --> 00:33:28,840
I get it. For you, I will sacrifice myself.

413
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:33,930
I will embrace the vicious and tiring advising for you.

414
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,460
- It's fine. 
 - It's fine?

415
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,520
You can do it, I see.

416
00:33:39,520 --> 00:33:44,670
But, since you've been to the drama set, is it fun?

417
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:48,790
How is the atmosphere between Yoon Seo and the male lead?

418
00:33:48,790 --> 00:33:52,840
I didn't see the male lead yesterday. What do you mean by atmosphere?

419
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:58,300
There was something I was curious about. I saw the behind the scenes video of Yoon Seo on set

420
00:33:58,300 --> 00:34:01,250
and the chemistry between the two leads is amazing.

421
00:34:01,250 --> 00:34:05,270
If you look at the comments, some say that they might be dating.

422
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,950
- Really?
 - I'm an expert at this kind of stuff.

423
00:34:08,950 --> 00:34:13,230
From what I can see, I think there's something going on with those two.

424
00:34:13,230 --> 00:34:17,060
For some reason, there seems to be a possibility that those two will end up dating through this drama.

425
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:18,930
I'm going crazy.

426
00:34:25,460 --> 00:34:26,450
Aren't you leaving?

427
00:34:26,450 --> 00:34:28,460
Are you feeling really uncomfortable?

428
00:34:45,410 --> 00:34:47,430
 Moon Ji Hoo 

429
00:34:54,450 --> 00:34:56,150
 Kiss Master 

430
00:34:58,410 --> 00:35:00,710
Kiss Master?

431
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,660
Lawyer Dan, this is your schedule for next week.

432
00:35:10,660 --> 00:35:13,610
- Yes. I'll keep it for reference.
 - Okay.

433
00:35:15,300 --> 00:35:18,490
Lawyer Dan, do you know how to play the ukelele?

434
00:35:18,490 --> 00:35:22,280
Ah, I started it as a hobby.

435
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:25,770
I learned from someone briefly, too.

436
00:35:25,770 --> 00:35:27,700
I wanted to learn how to play the ukelele, too.

437
00:35:27,700 --> 00:35:31,030
If it's not rude, can  I take a look at it once?

438
00:35:31,030 --> 00:35:33,000
Yes, well.

439
00:35:35,890 --> 00:35:40,170
I learned the basic principles of playing while watching videos on the internet.

440
00:35:43,150 --> 00:35:45,210
You do it like this, right?

441
00:35:47,430 --> 00:35:49,220
With your fingers,

442
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:53,420
- you use your second one like this.
 - Ah.

443
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:58,680
- Like this?
 - Your posture is...

444
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:04,050
If you look, you hold it as if you're holding a baby

445
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,710
and play the C chord.

446
00:36:15,560 --> 00:36:16,930
Ah, like this?

447
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:19,250
You're doing that well.

448
00:36:27,170 --> 00:36:31,430
No matter how we ended up, how can she take the ukelele that she used to make memories with me

449
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:34,630
and create harmony with another man?

450
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:36,330
I really can't understand that woman!

451
00:36:36,330 --> 00:36:39,120
- Just doing it at the ukulele club ... 
 - Did she just pass by there?

452
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,060
It felt a little awkward going alone.

453
00:36:41,060 --> 00:36:42,270
Why are they together?

454
00:36:42,270 --> 00:36:44,960
I'm happy to be going with you, Lawyer Dan.

455
00:36:44,960 --> 00:36:49,500
Well, it's a chance to see a good performance, so I'm the one who's happy.

456
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,370
Lawyer Dan, have a talk with me.

457
00:36:55,370 --> 00:36:59,590
I have plans with Jeong Hwan right now. We agreed to go see a ukelele performance.

458
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:02,090
No, you can't go! Not ever!

459
00:37:02,090 --> 00:37:06,860
I'm sorry, but can you go to that performance by yourself?

460
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:13,090
I have something important to discuss with Lawyer Dan right now, at this exact moment.

461
00:37:15,230 --> 00:37:18,650
What is it? You said you have something important to tell me?

462
00:37:18,650 --> 00:37:23,510
- Lawyer Dan, give me back the ukelele that I gave you.
 - What?

463
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:27,060
Wait. Wh-Why are you taking it back after you gave it to me?

464
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,500
As you said, why are you taking it back after you gave it to me?

465
00:37:29,500 --> 00:37:31,280
What did I...?

466
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:34,030
Lawyer Dan, didn't you give me your heart and then take it back?

467
00:37:34,030 --> 00:37:37,090
If you were going to take it back like this, you should have just not treated me well.

468
00:37:37,090 --> 00:37:40,710
Why did you get your hair pulled on my birthday?

469
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:43,840
Why did you get exhausted?  Why did you pack up and take the vitamins?

470
00:37:43,840 --> 00:37:45,560
Why did you do that? Why?!

471
00:37:45,560 --> 00:37:47,990
What are you talking about all of a sudden?

472
00:37:47,990 --> 00:37:53,420
You told me not long ago that your heart wasn't moving toward me.

473
00:37:53,420 --> 00:37:54,960
Yes!

474
00:37:56,430 --> 00:38:00,060
I thought it wasn't moving. However...

475
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:19,400
What is this? This beating?

476
00:38:23,490 --> 00:38:25,440
Like a fool,

477
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:31,590
I felt your absence and my heart started moving. Also...

478
00:38:32,630 --> 00:38:36,360
When I saw you laughing with someone else that isn't me,

479
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:39,100
it even hurt to the point of having sharp pains.

480
00:38:39,590 --> 00:38:41,310
My heart

481
00:38:43,590 --> 00:38:46,580
has not been able to rest because of you, Lawyer Dan.

482
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:47,410
So...

483
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,490
So...?

484
00:38:51,910 --> 00:38:56,380
Let's date. Not a contract relationship, but a real one.

485
00:38:59,790 --> 00:39:02,650
I'll give you three seconds to answer.

486
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:04,760
Three.

487
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,170
Two.

488
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:08,690
One.

489
00:39:16,660 --> 00:39:18,170
Half of one.

490
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:23,790
Half of half of one.

491
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:29,650
Half of half of half of one.

492
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:34,920
I'd love to! I'll date you! I'll totally date you!

493
00:39:43,390 --> 00:39:44,950
Those are the good times.

494
00:39:44,950 --> 00:39:48,430
They must be dating.  It's a good time.

495
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:57,300
Is she still filming?

496
00:40:00,070 --> 00:40:01,190
Mr. Lawyer!

497
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,420
Oh Jin Sim! How did you get here?

498
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:08,850
- Get in!
 - Ah, yes.

499
00:40:16,580 --> 00:40:19,980
Didn't you say that you had a filming shoot? And what about your manager?

500
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:22,790
The filming was canceled,

501
00:40:22,790 --> 00:40:26,410
so Oppa Hyeok Joon sent me home.

502
00:40:26,410 --> 00:40:28,700
I was going to call you before I came,

503
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:33,830
but I also wanted to surprise you, so I showed up suddenly!

504
00:40:33,830 --> 00:40:37,810
It's a good thing you did. Since you showed up like this, I'm even happier to see you.

505
00:40:37,810 --> 00:40:40,240
Right? You're really happy, aren't you?

506
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:44,000
We're this happy, so I don't know how we were able to stay apart like that.

507
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,890
That's what I'm saying.

508
00:40:47,050 --> 00:40:50,430
It's a relief that your filming was canceled. You must have been really tired.

509
00:40:50,430 --> 00:40:52,650
It's okay. What do you mean, tired?

510
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:57,890
But still. From what I saw of the filming set yesterday,

511
00:40:57,890 --> 00:41:01,830
working as an actor seems like a very physically demanding job.

512
00:41:01,830 --> 00:41:04,900
So don't eat only a little because you're dieting.

513
00:41:04,900 --> 00:41:08,830
You have to eat a lot and take good care of your health. Alright?

514
00:41:10,420 --> 00:41:13,960
Mr. Lawyer, you're the one who needs to take good care of your health.

515
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:17,370
You're the one who works the most at Always Law Firm.

516
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:21,510
Ah. Let's not eat this. Let's eat a healthy dessert instead.

517
00:41:26,460 --> 00:41:29,400
It's red ginseng.  Hurry and eat it.

518
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,890
Yes.

519
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:42,840
- Mr. Lawyer, there's something for you to do after you gain some strength from eating that.
 - Huh?

520
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:45,730
Help me practice my lines.

521
00:41:45,730 --> 00:41:47,760
- Practice your lines?
 - Yeah.

522
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:52,500
It's much easier to do with someone else than doing it alone.

523
00:41:52,500 --> 00:41:56,990
I want to try the scenes that I'll be filming tomorrow first. You'll help me, right?

524
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,700
Ah, yes.

525
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:02,360
I'm seeing all kinds of things now.

526
00:42:04,750 --> 00:42:07,470
The script is...

527
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:11,690
Here it is.

528
00:42:22,020 --> 00:42:26,930
That's right. There's a kiss scene in this one, isn't there?

529
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:33,340
 - Oh my, Jeong Do. You're supposed to be in Assyria, so why are you here?
 - Um, that's... 

530
00:42:34,390 --> 00:42:36,230
 I came so that I wouldn't have any regrets 

531
00:42:36,230 --> 00:42:40,770
 so that I wouldn't regret losing you for the rest of my life, Ju Ha. 

532
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:49,540
 It says here that Jeong Do grabs Ju Ha's wrist, pulls her to him, and kisses her. 

533
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:54,200
 You can just skip over this part. 

534
00:42:55,690 --> 00:42:57,860
 Why would I just skip over it? 

535
00:42:58,400 --> 00:43:02,360
 Since I agreed to practice, I'll do it thoroughly. 

536
00:43:12,730 --> 00:43:14,830
What should I do?

537
00:43:16,190 --> 00:43:18,390
Should I just not do it?

538
00:43:19,230 --> 00:43:22,770
No. I have to practice.

539
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:24,910
Practice...

540
00:43:29,070 --> 00:43:32,860
Mr. Lawyer, here's the script.

541
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:36,020
Ah, this is fascinating.

542
00:43:42,590 --> 00:43:45,000
So this is how it's written.

543
00:43:47,970 --> 00:43:49,700
What is this?

544
00:43:49,700 --> 00:43:51,430
What?

545
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:54,510
Look here.

546
00:43:54,510 --> 00:43:56,060
It says, "Respected Judge,

547
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:00,130
the defendant is deeply reflecting over his actions." Does it not?

548
00:44:00,130 --> 00:44:01,620
Yes.

549
00:44:02,620 --> 00:44:06,180
- Isn't this situation's concept a criminal case?
 - Yes.

550
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:10,030
In criminal cases, they are called "the accused." In civil cases, they are called "the defendant."

551
00:44:10,030 --> 00:44:14,640
So it's right to say "the accused" instead of "the defendant" right here.

552
00:44:14,640 --> 00:44:19,350
I'm not the one who writes the script, so...

553
00:44:19,350 --> 00:44:22,590
This jargon is the basics of the basics, though.

554
00:44:22,590 --> 00:44:24,490
- Are you angry?
 - Ah, yes.

555
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:30,630
I will make sure I relay this to the writer.

556
00:44:30,630 --> 00:44:33,650
Yes, please make sure you do.

557
00:44:36,080 --> 00:44:38,950
Ah, then. Let's try this scene.

558
00:44:38,950 --> 00:44:40,590
Which one?

559
00:44:40,590 --> 00:44:43,350
It's scene 27, the trial scene.

560
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,680
- The trial scene?
 - Yes.

561
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:50,570
- Go in front and try it. Do it properly, while standing. 
- What?

562
00:44:50,570 --> 00:44:53,340
- While standing?
 - Yes, in the front.

563
00:44:54,570 --> 00:44:57,260
-  I'll take a precise look at it. 
 - Yes.

564
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:04,340
The plaintiff, through shoddy construction work, completed the demolition.

565
00:45:04,340 --> 00:45:06,050
Oh Jin Sim.

566
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:12,100
Oh Jin Sim, the plaintiff is usually sitting to your left.

567
00:45:12,150 --> 00:45:14,000
Left?

568
00:45:17,930 --> 00:45:21,790
The plaintiff, through shoddy construction work, completed the demolition.

569
00:45:21,790 --> 00:45:24,960
Failing in the effort to raise the PF funds ...

570
00:45:27,260 --> 00:45:29,820
"Weren't you unable to pay for the cost of construction?"

571
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:33,180
Weren't you unable to pay for the cost of construction?

572
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,000
- Oh Jin Sim. 
 - Yes?

573
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,410
I don't think the intonation just now was any good.

574
00:45:42,460 --> 00:45:46,290
Because it's actually very rare to raise one's voice in court like that.

575
00:45:46,300 --> 00:45:50,300
I think you should finish with a charismatic understated tone of voice.

576
00:45:51,150 --> 00:45:54,330
The plaintiff, through shoddy construction work, completed the demolition.

577
00:45:54,370 --> 00:45:56,390
Failing in the effort to raise the PF funds,

578
00:45:56,390 --> 00:45:59,140
weren't you unable to pay for the cost of construction?"

579
00:45:59,140 --> 00:46:02,410
- Like that. 
 -  Yes, like that.

580
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:04,400
- I'll try it again. 
 - Yes.

581
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:10,000
The plaintiff, the plaintiff through unlimited construction ...

582
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:13,370
Oh Jin Sim, it  is not "unlimited" ( mujin ) construction but "shoddy" ( bujin ) construction.

583
00:46:13,370 --> 00:46:17,110
Ah, yes.  Shoddy, not unlimited, shoddy construction.

584
00:46:18,170 --> 00:46:19,920
I'll go drink some water and come back.

585
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,710
Yes, do come back.

586
00:46:25,600 --> 00:46:27,830
"The plaintiff through shoddy construction ..."

587
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:35,890
I thought it was going to be a romantic atmosphere.

588
00:46:35,890 --> 00:46:39,350
This is more draining than being on-site.

589
00:46:43,070 --> 00:46:47,510
It's such a relief that I could be of help to you even in this way, Oh Jin Sim!

590
00:46:47,510 --> 00:46:49,460
Yes.

591
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:58,130
A part at the courthouse. After the hearing, on the way out of the courthouse, Ju Ha is surprised to see someone.

592
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:02,480
When she looks,  Jeong Do is standing at a corner of the courthouse, dressed in his uniform.

593
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:05,850
Jeong Do ... Ju Ha's hand ...

594
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,560
... he kisses it.

595
00:47:12,180 --> 00:47:16,350
The image of the two of them kissing is seen against the court as background.

596
00:47:20,810 --> 00:47:23,640
 Kiss Master 

597
00:47:31,770 --> 00:47:34,520
 Kiss Master, they said. 

598
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:41,380
Ah, right! For the team dinner later this evening, I made a reservation at the Korean beef restaurant out front.

599
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:45,260
Ah, good job. That's good. The beef tartare there is a work of art.

600
00:47:45,260 --> 00:47:48,180
The chef is a total beef master. He's a master.

601
00:47:48,190 --> 00:47:52,350
What do you mean, master? Where in the world does a kiss master even exist?

602
00:47:52,350 --> 00:47:54,930
Was the chef a kiss master?

603
00:47:57,250 --> 00:47:59,950
Ah, it's nothing. I'll get up first.

604
00:47:59,950 --> 00:48:01,520
Why? You're not going to finish eating?

605
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:04,150
Yes, I have something to take care of at the courthouse.

606
00:48:05,290 --> 00:48:08,780
Kiss master.  He's not even a master of skiing.

607
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:12,250
I think he said something about a kiss.

608
00:48:12,250 --> 00:48:15,740
Does Lawyer Kwon want to date, too?

609
00:48:15,740 --> 00:48:20,340
Anyway, it's springtime too so he could also be feeling restless.

610
00:48:20,340 --> 00:48:23,240
Why wouldn't Lawyer Kwon be thinking of dating?

611
00:48:24,600 --> 00:48:27,300
Wait a minute. Now that I look at it, we're all single.

612
00:48:27,300 --> 00:48:31,710
There are so many people here, so why is it that not one of us is dating?

613
00:48:31,710 --> 00:48:36,470
If you don't have time to go outside and look for someone, then look for someone inside here. Even if it's someone here.

614
00:48:36,530 --> 00:48:39,470
When you look at other companies, they're full of in-office couples.

615
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:42,740
How could we all have no good news? Goodness.

616
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:46,610
But didn't you originally say that you don't like office couples because they can't concentrate on their work?

617
00:48:46,610 --> 00:48:49,970
Ah, I'm not such a narrow-minded person.

618
00:48:49,970 --> 00:48:58,220
And, if there is a couple in our company, I want you to look pretty dating so I will buy you each a spring outfit.

619
00:48:58,220 --> 00:49:03,670
So as soon as you become a couple, raise your hands and come report to me.

620
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:06,210
What are you two doing?

621
00:49:06,210 --> 00:49:09,640
You told us to report. Lawyer Dan and I are a couple.

622
00:49:09,640 --> 00:49:13,920
Yes. We're a brand new couple who just decided to start dating yesterday.

623
00:49:15,850 --> 00:49:18,060
What are you two doing?

624
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:20,910
No matter how much you want a new outfit, does it make sense to say you are a couple?

625
00:49:20,910 --> 00:49:23,420
Ah, seriously. You're hilarious.

626
00:49:31,650 --> 00:49:35,000
Lawyer Dan and Lawyer Choi, you're really a couple?

627
00:49:36,980 --> 00:49:39,790
I've been properly stabbed in the back.

628
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:51,780
Ah, if the filming team is there, then she's around there somewhere.

629
00:49:57,020 --> 00:49:58,420
- Oh!
 - Yoon Seo.

630
00:49:58,420 --> 00:50:01,070
How are you thinking of doing this?

631
00:50:01,070 --> 00:50:03,040
If you do it comfortably, I'll work along with you.

632
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:04,070
- Ah, really?
 - Yes.

633
00:50:04,070 --> 00:50:06,390
Alright.

634
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:09,520
Oh?

635
00:50:11,810 --> 00:50:14,050
Mr. Lawyer!

636
00:50:14,090 --> 00:50:15,590
Yes.

637
00:50:16,720 --> 00:50:18,590
What are you doing here?

638
00:50:18,590 --> 00:50:20,620
I came because I had something to do in the courthouse, then I heard that you were filming here.

639
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:23,540
So I came just in case there's something that I could help with.

640
00:50:26,180 --> 00:50:30,320
It's really nice to film at the courthouse. We're even able to run into each other coincidentally like this.

641
00:50:30,320 --> 00:50:30,960
Yes.

642
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:33,740
Yoon Seo! They said they're moving on to the kiss!

643
00:50:36,150 --> 00:50:37,140
 What? 

644
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:42,280
I'll head on first, Mr. Laywer.

645
00:50:42,280 --> 00:50:43,950
Yes.

646
00:50:52,980 --> 00:50:55,580
Jeong Do!

647
00:50:56,820 --> 00:51:00,530
How did you get here? You're supposed to be in Assyria, so why are you here?

648
00:51:00,530 --> 00:51:02,280
I came so that I wouldn't have any regrets.

649
00:51:02,280 --> 00:51:05,850
So that I wouldn't regret losing you for the rest of my life, Ju Ha.

650
00:51:22,510 --> 00:51:24,790
Cut!  What's this?

651
00:51:24,790 --> 00:51:27,230
Did you just hear the sound of a car there?

652
00:51:27,230 --> 00:51:29,840
Please control the noise well.

653
00:51:29,840 --> 00:51:31,930
Alright, standby. We'll do it again!

654
00:51:31,930 --> 00:51:35,320
O-o-one moment.

655
00:51:37,370 --> 00:51:40,100
Can I suggest something as the  lawyer consultant?

656
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,700
Yes, of course.

657
00:51:41,700 --> 00:51:44,850
I know that it's a drama, but I think it's really unrealistic for a man and woman

658
00:51:44,850 --> 00:51:48,130
to kiss in front of a courthouse like this.

659
00:51:48,130 --> 00:51:51,050
Plus, this is a lawyer, who has sworn to uphold the law,

660
00:51:51,050 --> 00:51:53,190
and a military judge-advocate kissing in front of the sacred courthouse.

661
00:51:53,190 --> 00:51:56,110
If I look at it as someone who works in this field,

662
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:59,170
I think that this may be a very unreasonable setting.

663
00:51:59,170 --> 00:52:01,820
This is a really conservative place.

664
00:52:03,870 --> 00:52:07,850
But if this is a scene that really needs an emotional moment,

665
00:52:08,930 --> 00:52:11,680
- then a hug! I think a hug would be good.
 - A hug?

666
00:52:11,700 --> 00:52:15,540
No, no. No, a hug won't work either.

667
00:52:16,510 --> 00:52:19,950
A handshake. I think that a handshake would be good enough.

668
00:52:19,950 --> 00:52:22,130
Mr. Lawyer, come have a cup of coffee with me.

669
00:52:22,130 --> 00:52:24,050
What? I'm okay without coffee, though.

670
00:52:24,050 --> 00:52:26,490
Well, the coffee won't be okay.

671
00:52:27,890 --> 00:52:31,170
But what I'm seeing.  Well, because you told me not to interfere

672
00:52:31,170 --> 00:52:34,330
because it was a violation of your right to pursue happiness or something ...

673
00:52:34,330 --> 00:52:37,590
What are you doing right now, Mr. Lawyer?

674
00:52:37,600 --> 00:52:40,430
I just fulfilled my role as the lawyer consultant.

675
00:52:40,430 --> 00:52:43,350
No, if you came as  lawyer consultant, then you should be consulting.

676
00:52:43,350 --> 00:52:45,690
Why are you being jealous? It's jealousy.

677
00:52:45,690 --> 00:52:46,950
It's not jealousy.

678
00:52:46,950 --> 00:52:49,940
It  is  jealousy.

679
00:52:49,940 --> 00:52:52,720
Look over there. Okay? Look over there.

680
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:55,730
Earlier, you said the people at the courthouse are really conservative or whatever.

681
00:52:55,730 --> 00:53:00,120
But they are holding hands so confidently out in the open like that! Where is the conservatism? Where is it?

682
00:53:00,120 --> 00:53:02,340
Th-There's no way that they're doing that.

683
00:53:02,340 --> 00:53:05,990
This courthouse is a really conservative place, so them going around like that...

684
00:53:08,300 --> 00:53:10,940
Kim Se Won?

685
00:53:10,940 --> 00:53:13,260
Yeah? Kwon Jeong Rok!

686
00:53:13,310 --> 00:53:15,340
Jeong Rok?

687
00:53:15,340 --> 00:53:17,680
And they're even people you know?!

688
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:19,960
I don't know them.

689
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,550
Kim Se Won! Jeong Rok!

690
00:53:22,590 --> 00:53:23,890
I will exercise my right to remain silent.

691
00:53:23,890 --> 00:53:26,500
Oh, my. Look at this Lawyer of Jealousy.

692
00:53:29,760 --> 00:53:33,780
Is it alright for you to wear your prosecutor's gowns and walk around holding hands like that?

693
00:53:33,780 --> 00:53:36,960
What about it? It's not like we aren't working just because we're dating,

694
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,240
and we wondered how long we had to live dating secretly.

695
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:44,560
We decided not to worry about the people around us and live our lives expressing ourselves as much as we want.

696
00:53:44,560 --> 00:53:48,390
Me, too. If it were just me, I would have never thought of something like this,

697
00:53:48,390 --> 00:53:50,650
but what Se Won said is right.

698
00:53:50,650 --> 00:53:55,280
At first, it's hard. But it wasn't really a big deal after doing it once or twice.

699
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:01,300
Jeong Rok, what should I do? I must be starting to resemble Kim Se Won.

700
00:54:02,610 --> 00:54:05,110
Alright, alright.

701
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:34,920
Alright, to Always!

702
00:54:41,210 --> 00:54:44,080
But how did you two ended up becoming attracted to each other?

703
00:54:44,080 --> 00:54:47,820
That's right? You two were always like cats and dogs.

704
00:54:47,820 --> 00:54:50,110
Honestly, not even just as my man,

705
00:54:50,110 --> 00:54:53,030
Lawyer Choi was born to be loved.

706
00:54:53,030 --> 00:54:55,920
He's handsome, competent, gentle,

707
00:54:55,920 --> 00:55:00,030
and on top of that, he has the utmost filial piety. Really, he's the best man.

708
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:04,500
It's the same for Lawyer Dan. Sometimes she's cute and sometimes she's aloof.

709
00:55:04,540 --> 00:55:08,040
The woman who has a divine face.

710
00:55:08,090 --> 00:55:11,530
Alright. I don't really empathize with what you two are saying,

711
00:55:11,530 --> 00:55:14,140
but a promise is a promise anyway.

712
00:55:15,190 --> 00:55:18,250
Here, so you can both get one spring suit each.

713
00:55:18,250 --> 00:55:21,750
Thank you, Mr. CEO! Shall we dress in matching couple suits?

714
00:55:21,750 --> 00:55:24,500
In a cool style which fits Lawyer Dan?

715
00:55:24,500 --> 00:55:26,670
Mm, no.

716
00:55:26,670 --> 00:55:32,220
Shall we go with a classy and chic style that matches you perfectly, Honey?

717
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:34,380
- Here, here.
 - Goodness.

718
00:55:34,430 --> 00:55:38,960
I don't know why I have to ruin my eyes by seeing something like that.

719
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:41,890
Anyway, if there are any other couples still hidden, say it now.

720
00:55:41,890 --> 00:55:44,810
That way I can buy you all suits at the same time.

721
00:55:44,810 --> 00:55:50,250
Anyway, I have a lot of loans.  Seven hundred million or seven hundred million seven hundred in debt, right?

722
00:55:50,250 --> 00:55:55,540
Hae Yeong, if you are so inclined, I would like to purchase a new spring suit with you.

723
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,760
I have a lot of suits.

724
00:56:09,260 --> 00:56:13,880
But Lawyer Kwon, is something wrong?

725
00:56:14,730 --> 00:56:19,040
That's right. You haven't looked good since earlier.

726
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:24,030
Is it possible that you had a one-sided crush on Lawyer Dan,

727
00:56:24,030 --> 00:56:27,830
but your heart hurts because you see her with Lawyer Choi so you're gulping down alcohol?

728
00:56:27,830 --> 00:56:29,630
Is that it?

729
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:32,250
A one-sided love is love too. I'll be rooting for you.

730
00:56:32,250 --> 00:56:34,310
Oh, no.

731
00:56:41,610 --> 00:56:44,730
Mr. Lawyer, are you still at your firm dinner?

732
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:49,880
I see. I'm heading home after finishing filming.

733
00:56:51,380 --> 00:56:54,920
Then call me when you're done with the firm dinner.

734
00:56:54,920 --> 00:56:56,560
Yes.

735
00:56:57,720 --> 00:56:59,390
Did Mr. Laywer not say anything special?

736
00:56:59,390 --> 00:57:01,430
Anything special?

737
00:57:01,430 --> 00:57:04,870
- What?
 - No, well...

738
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:11,390
Nothing. It just seemed like he was a little jealous because of your kiss scene earlier.

739
00:57:11,440 --> 00:57:17,100
- I was wondering if he'd said anything like you're doing too much or something about it.
 - What?

740
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:20,910
Goodness. Well, that's the life of a celebrity's boyfriend.

741
00:57:20,960 --> 00:57:23,770
You have to pretend to be okay while looking at love scenes like that

742
00:57:23,770 --> 00:57:26,290
but you get jealous again.

743
00:57:26,290 --> 00:57:28,940
Well, could he go around openly saying that you're dating

744
00:57:28,980 --> 00:57:32,480
or confidently go out in the open and have a date somewhere where there are a lot of people?

745
00:57:33,560 --> 00:57:35,710
Yoon Seo.

746
00:57:35,710 --> 00:57:38,530
That's why I'm worried even more.

747
00:57:38,580 --> 00:57:41,110
I'm wondering if you two will be alright.

748
00:57:41,110 --> 00:57:46,080
Dating secretly is something that you can't help but get tired of someday.

749
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:55,950
My Baby, say ah.

750
00:57:58,690 --> 00:58:00,820
Honey, you say ah.

751
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:06,380
This is really an Always where love is blooming flowers.

752
00:58:06,380 --> 00:58:10,480
I'm not sure about that. Anger is blooming in my heart.

753
00:58:10,510 --> 00:58:16,770
You know, since I'm looking at you two, I see why CEO's don't like in-office relationships.

754
00:58:16,770 --> 00:58:20,540
What sins have CEOs committed that they have to pay you and see something like that?

755
00:58:20,540 --> 00:58:23,820
I think that I'll get sick with anger if this goes on.

756
00:58:23,820 --> 00:58:28,090
It seems like everyone's done eating, so let's get up and go. Let's go!

757
00:58:28,150 --> 00:58:30,200
- Oh, Yoon Seo!
  - Hello.

758
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:31,840
Yoon Seo!

759
00:58:31,840 --> 00:58:33,290
What are you doing here?

760
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:38,170
Ah, I received a high-quality tip that you were here having a  firm  dinner, so I stopped by.

761
00:58:38,170 --> 00:58:42,380
It's good that you came. We were just about to start. Come this way. Come on.

762
00:58:43,260 --> 00:58:46,040
Hello.

763
00:58:48,300 --> 00:58:49,680
Jeong Hwan, where's your spot?

764
00:58:49,680 --> 00:58:52,230
- I think it's over there.
 - Ah, I see.

765
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:58,180
Yoon Seo! Yoon Seo. I have some really big news.

766
00:58:58,180 --> 00:59:02,260
It's that Lawyer Choi and Lawyer Dan are dating!

767
00:59:02,260 --> 00:59:03,920
Oh? Really?

768
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,950
It turned out like that. I was planning on calling you to give you the news tomorrow, anyway.

769
00:59:09,970 --> 00:59:11,630
Congratulations! Congratulations.

770
00:59:11,630 --> 00:59:14,270
Lawyer Kwon, aren't you happy to see Yoon Seo?

771
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:16,300
- Why aren't you saying anything?
 - Huh?

772
00:59:16,300 --> 00:59:21,180
There must really be something going on with Lawyer Kwon. He's frowning so much.

773
00:59:21,180 --> 00:59:25,260
Is it because you're in the spirit of spring? It must be because you're lonely.

774
00:59:25,260 --> 00:59:27,850
- What do you mean?
 - What do you mean, what do I mean?

775
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:31,390
Let's not leave it this way. Let's set up some blind dates for Lawyer Kwon.

776
00:59:32,500 --> 00:59:33,610
I'm fine.

777
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:35,950
What do you mean, you're fine? You don't have a girlfriend,

778
00:59:35,950 --> 00:59:38,780
so it's good to be introduced to others at a time like this.

779
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:42,390
Hae Young, Lawyer Dan. Is there anyone around you that you can think of?

780
00:59:42,390 --> 00:59:45,210
- Do you not have anyone around you?
 - Um...

781
00:59:45,210 --> 00:59:47,260
Excuse me!

782
00:59:47,260 --> 00:59:52,630
Lawyer Kwon does have a girlfriend.

783
00:59:54,900 --> 00:59:57,830
- What do you...?
 - R-Really?

784
00:59:57,830 --> 00:59:59,550
You're saying that Lawyer Kwon has a girlfriend?

785
00:59:59,550 --> 01:00:03,270
Yes. That's...

786
01:00:03,270 --> 01:00:07,500
That's... It's none other than...

787
01:00:08,920 --> 01:00:11,210
It's me.

788
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:20,280
Oh, you're hilarious, for real.

789
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,740
She really is an actress! Without a blink, she tells a joke

790
01:00:23,740 --> 01:00:26,050
and she said that she's his girlfriend!

791
01:00:26,050 --> 01:00:29,000
It's true!

792
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:37,070
I hesitated a little bit,

793
01:00:37,070 --> 01:00:42,640
but since I'm in front of people that I really like and trust, I'm trying to tell the truth.

794
01:00:44,020 --> 01:00:53,410
Lawyer Kwon and I are really in a romantic relationship.

795
01:01:02,700 --> 01:01:08,770
I really like Lawyer Kwon.

796
01:01:10,450 --> 01:01:13,520
So that's how it was.

797
01:01:13,580 --> 01:01:15,040
Yes.

798
01:01:18,510 --> 01:01:21,600
Mr. CEO, isn't that hot?

799
01:01:22,460 --> 01:01:24,520
Ah, it's hot!

800
01:01:30,180 --> 01:01:32,340
It's hot, seriously. It's so hot. Ow.

801
01:01:32,340 --> 01:01:34,760
- Really? You're not crying because your heart hurts? 
- It's really hot.

802
01:01:34,760 --> 01:01:36,950
Ah, no! No, it's because it's hot.

803
01:01:36,950 --> 01:01:41,400
I'm crying because my hand hurts so much. It got burned.

804
01:01:41,400 --> 01:01:45,300
Seriously, congratulations. Seriously.

805
01:01:45,300 --> 01:01:50,700
I'll go to the bathroom. Ah, I'm so happy! The bathroom...

806
01:01:50,700 --> 01:01:53,860
Congratulations, really!

807
01:02:02,530 --> 01:02:07,420
I really never could have imagined that there were so many couples at our law firm.

808
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:12,960
I know, right? Lawyer Kwon and Yoon Seo were really unexpected for me.

809
01:02:12,960 --> 01:02:18,270
Those two seem to be very different in some way, but they also seem to suit each other well.

810
01:02:18,270 --> 01:02:20,710
I think it's good they're dating.

811
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:23,230
Omo! It's forsythias.

812
01:02:23,230 --> 01:02:25,450
Oh! That's right.

813
01:02:25,450 --> 01:02:27,760
Forsythias are my favorite flowers.

814
01:02:27,760 --> 01:02:31,220
Do you perhaps know what forsythias represent?

815
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:34,300
No. What is it?

816
01:02:38,810 --> 01:02:43,500
My love ... is deeper than yours.

817
01:02:44,290 --> 01:02:46,200
Ah, yes.

818
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:55,580
Excuse me, Secretary Yang.

819
01:02:55,620 --> 01:03:00,360
If it's okay with you, do you want to have a meal with me sometime?

820
01:03:02,060 --> 01:03:04,540
Alright, then.

821
01:03:17,430 --> 01:03:19,990
Why are you suddenly bringing out alcohol? 
   

822
01:03:19,990 --> 01:03:23,120
Because I wanted to have a glass as a celebration and commemoration of today.

823
01:03:23,120 --> 01:03:28,060
Today is the day that we let someone know about our relationship for the first time.

824
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:34,100
But is it really okay? Needlessly, because of me...

825
01:03:34,960 --> 01:03:36,640
Mr. Lawyer.

826
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:42,740
Do you know what you say to me the most?

827
01:03:42,740 --> 01:03:47,230
If I'm okay. You ask me if I'm really okay.

828
01:03:47,230 --> 01:03:50,310
You're always saying that.

829
01:03:50,310 --> 01:03:54,250
But I suddenly had this thought today.

830
01:03:54,250 --> 01:03:58,450
"Is this person who is asking me if I'm okay

831
01:03:58,450 --> 01:04:01,870
really alright?"

832
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:08,440
"Is he not taking care of his own heart because he's so worried about me?"

833
01:04:09,550 --> 01:04:15,080
If you're not alright, Mr. Lawyer, then I'm not alright either.

834
01:04:15,080 --> 01:04:20,640
Because your heart is my heart.

835
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:28,140
And another thing. I thought that we had to meet today because I wanted to say this.

836
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,310
What is it?

837
01:04:31,820 --> 01:04:36,100
That kiss scene that I was filming earlier really isn't real!

838
01:04:36,100 --> 01:04:38,750
Yes. Well, you don't have to talk about that anymore.

839
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:40,960
No, don't avoid it and listen to me.

840
01:04:41,000 --> 01:04:46,810
That's just acting. It's acting. I'm saying that we weren't really kissing.

841
01:04:46,810 --> 01:04:52,360
Look. We grab each other like this and do this, and then this.

842
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:56,170
It seems like we're really doing it just because they switch the angle.

843
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:02,460
Anyway, I'm telling you to not misunderstand.

844
01:05:03,600 --> 01:05:06,350
All actors have that skill.

845
01:05:06,350 --> 01:05:09,900
The skill where they can make what's fake seem real.

846
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:14,150
Then what about when it's real instead of pretend?

847
01:05:19,040 --> 01:05:22,260
Do you do it like this?

848
01:05:52,450 --> 01:05:57,540
Is it alright if I don't protect you tonight?

849
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:24,360
♫  So make it count  ♫

850
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:27,500
♫  Please remember today  ♫

860
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,030
Ta-Da!

861
01:07:00,030 --> 01:07:02,460
But why did she choose Lawyer Kwon instead of me?

862
01:07:02,460 --> 01:07:05,750
Because he's cool and his face is so handsome!

863
01:07:05,750 --> 01:07:08,040
How could you be so sneaky?

864
01:07:08,040 --> 01:07:09,170
You seriously...!

865
01:07:09,170 --> 01:07:12,410
No matter how quickly you fall in love, how could you, with your boyfriend right in front of you?

866
01:07:12,410 --> 01:07:15,980
You remember that we agreed to have dinner together tomorrow, right?

867
01:07:15,980 --> 01:07:17,870
Then, I'm really going to your house now.

868
01:07:17,870 --> 01:07:18,840
Alright.

869
01:07:18,840 --> 01:07:21,750
On Day 1, the secretary is  there now in the office and waiting.

870
01:07:21,760 --> 01:07:22,650
Oh Jin Sim!

871
01:07:22,650 --> 01:07:23,980
The flight is tomorrow morning.

872
01:07:23,980 --> 01:07:24,440
What?

873
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:26,330
Since you're dating an actress, you're doing things you've never done before.

874
01:07:26,330 --> 01:07:28,430
- Hello 
 - You've become the male lead in a melodrama.

875
01:07:28,430 --> 01:07:32,140
I want to tell you that I'll always be waiting for you here, in this spot.

876
01:07:32,140 --> 01:07:35,750
♫  Then make me everlasting.  ♫
