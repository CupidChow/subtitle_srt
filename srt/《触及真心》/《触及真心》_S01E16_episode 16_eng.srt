1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:07,000


2
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,540
 Touch Your Heart 

3
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:43,720
 Last Episode 

4
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,840
Mr. Lawyer, what are you doing?

5
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:17,760
You take care of breakfast every time, so I wanted to do it today.

6
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,980
That is why I prepared toast.

7
00:01:20,980 --> 00:01:23,000
It looks delicious.

8
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,620
But, how did you find all the ingredients?

9
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:30,100
I opened the refrigerator on my own accord and chose what to cook according to what's inside.

10
00:01:30,100 --> 00:01:32,590
However, there are no legal problems with it.

11
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:35,980
According to Article 329 of the Criminal Code, taking someone else's belongings

12
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:39,530
can result in a maximum of six years of prison or a maximum fine of ten million won.

13
00:01:39,530 --> 00:01:42,450
However, we are not just anyone to each other.

14
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:48,030
That's right. We are in a romantic relationship, so there is no problem at all.

15
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:49,780
Ah, do you want to taste it?

16
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,140
Yes.

17
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:02,130
Thank God. If you were also good at cooking, you would be so perfect it would be burdensome.

18
00:02:02,130 --> 00:02:03,310
Wow.

19
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:05,570
You don't have to force yourself to eat it.

20
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,320
It's a joke.

21
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:10,460
It's really delicious.

22
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:11,880
Mr. Lawyer, take a bite, too.

23
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:13,980
- Say "ah". 
 - Ah.

24
00:02:15,380 --> 00:02:18,650
What was that?

25
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,260
You just got home?

26
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:32,780
I didn't see you this morning, so I thought you went to play soccer again.

27
00:02:32,780 --> 00:02:34,810
Did you pull an all-nighter?

28
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:36,460
Well...

29
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:39,410
Wait a minute.

30
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,250
Yes. Tomorrow is the date for the hearing on the arrest warrant.

31
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:48,700
You can come before 11 am tomorrow morning.

32
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:52,240
Of course, it's hard on him.

33
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,600
I know it well.

34
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:59,360
It's been a month since he broke up with Yoon Seo.

35
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,470
It seems he's still struggling a lot.

36
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,920
If he doesn't do anything, he'll keep thinking of her.

37
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:07,520
So, instead he's working to death to forget her.

38
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,580
He spent the entire night at the law firm last night.

39
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,200
Really?

40
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,840
On top of that,

41
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:16,720
he started playing soccer which he never did before.

42
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,270
Why did he start playing soccer?

43
00:03:18,270 --> 00:03:22,500
Usually, when a man breaks up, he needs to find any hobby to do.

44
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,710
If Jeong Rok works out and sweats it out,

45
00:03:24,710 --> 00:03:26,960
his body will be tired from working out.

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:29,880
It's so heartbreaking that I can't stand it.

47
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,000
It's probably because his heart feels empty,

48
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,050
His appetite got better though. He bought two boxes of sushi and was going to eat them by himself.

49
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,930
It's that bad?

50
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:42,330
He should forget her soon. It's a huge problem.

51
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:44,440
That's what I said.

52
00:03:44,440 --> 00:03:47,220
It's worrisome.

53
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,240
I'm totally shocked.

54
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:52,190
I never knew that our law firm would have such a visual couple.

55
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,780
Those two people, don't they look good together?

56
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:58,640
Yes, yes. Thank you for looking at us in a good light.

57
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,270
I also think Lawyer Dan and I look good together.

58
00:04:01,270 --> 00:04:04,260
No, Lawyer Kwon and Yoon Seo.

59
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:07,360
I was talking about them.

60
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,820
And they  had  to start dating when we started, too.

61
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:13,610
These are my honest thoughts.

62
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:17,750
We don't lose to them for the title of visual couple.

63
00:04:17,750 --> 00:04:20,180
Solely that we lose  a little  to them in terms of fame.

64
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,670
- You're here? 
 - You're here?

65
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:28,120
Oh my gosh. You got a burn from taking a piece of meat off the grill with your hand yesterday?

66
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:30,510
Well, it's not serious.

67
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:32,880
I went to the hospital last night since it was bothering me.

68
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,840
And they told me it was a minor burn.

69
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:36,790
They told me to apply ointment for a few days and it'll be fine.

70
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:40,200
How shocked were you that you used your hand to grab a piece of meat?

71
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,790
I was very shocked. Who wouldn't be?

72
00:04:45,730 --> 00:04:49,090
Like I said, Yoon Seo was a star to me.

73
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:52,980
She was like a star, up in the sky where I couldn't reach her.

74
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,790
But, I couldn't imagine that

75
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:58,640
Yoon Seo would be dating a commoner.

76
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:02,630
To me, it's nice to see. It's unconventional.

77
00:05:02,630 --> 00:05:04,300
That's right, it's unconventional.

78
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:07,810
If her tastes were unconventional, she should've chosen me.

79
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:11,020
I'm even more unconventional, which is even better.

80
00:05:12,570 --> 00:05:15,300
But why is it not me, but rather Lawyer Kwon?

81
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:19,290
I don't lose to Lawyer Kwon in anything, am I right?

82
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:24,690
That's why I need to have a reason that will convince me, so it'll be less hurtful.

83
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:27,490
Why did she choose Lawyer Kwon and not me?

84
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:31,100
I know that the reason will be very hard to find.

85
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:36,160
However, if you have the slightest idea as to why, please tell me.

86
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,680
It will be really really difficult, butâ€”

87
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:40,100
Your looks, your age, your physical health, your visuals.

88
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:44,090
Oh, and didn't you say that you also had 700 million in debt.

89
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,130
If we consider it like that, you're not even at the level to compete.

90
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:50,920
At least, Lawyer Kwon doesn't have any debt.

91
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:01,980
What time was my consultation at again?

92
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:06,710
Ah, it's a celebrity's lover.

93
00:06:06,710 --> 00:06:09,550
Oh, Lawyer Kwon, come see me for a moment.

94
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:10,930
Yes.

95
00:06:12,290 --> 00:06:14,520
We have been assigned a new matter.

96
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:16,390
Did you submit your opinion as a lawyer yet?

97
00:06:16,390 --> 00:06:19,860
Yes. I wrote it and submitted it.

98
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:21,270
Are you sure?

99
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:24,480
- Do you have evidence that you submitted it? 
 - Excuse me?

100
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:30,690
No, but you're good at fooling people. That's why.

101
00:06:30,690 --> 00:06:33,130
You pretended you weren't in any relationship with Yoon Seo,

102
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:35,100
but you were a couple.

103
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:37,940
How can you be so deceiving?

104
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:41,800
Since Oh Jin Sim decided to reveal it, I didn't have any other choice.

105
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,290
 I have arrived on set. 

106
00:06:47,290 --> 00:06:49,030
 I miss you. 

107
00:06:49,030 --> 00:06:51,370
Lawyer Kwon, you're smiling.

108
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,350
Is it Yoon Seo?

109
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:57,270
- Sure, what did Yoon Seo do to make you smile?  
 - Nothing.

110
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,850
What do you mean by nothing? You keep lying like this, that's why

111
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:02,810
I say you are deceiving, you liar.

112
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:06,430
I understood. She said she missed me.

113
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:14,500
So, what did you reply?

114
00:07:14,500 --> 00:07:16,930
I don't know why I need to tell you this,

115
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:19,230
but I'm planning to reply with, "I miss you more."

116
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,900
Look. "I miss you more."

117
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:27,910
Heart. Heart.

118
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:30,500
Heart? Heart?

119
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:32,760
Lawyer Kwon, are you the Lawyer Kwon I know?

120
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,640
Why do you feel like a stranger?

121
00:07:34,640 --> 00:07:37,260
Well, I know it feels unfamiliar.

122
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,130
However, since we revealed it,

123
00:07:39,130 --> 00:07:41,570
without being deceiving, I am planning to

124
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,140
show her how much I love her.

125
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:48,400
Sure. It's right to express how you feel about other people.

126
00:07:50,380 --> 00:07:53,560
Lawyer Kwon, I don't know if it's because my legs are longer than others,

127
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,280
but the gap between the chair and table is constricting.

128
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,740
Can you move it further that way?

129
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:03,280
I want to do it, but my hand is like this.

130
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,680
Yes.

131
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:07,160
A little more.

132
00:08:09,080 --> 00:08:11,050
The little one, too.

133
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:14,610
Now that you've moved it, it looks empty.

134
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:18,090
Put it back to its original place.

135
00:08:18,090 --> 00:08:20,060
The smaller one, too.

136
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:23,040
You need to move it to this side, so it's back to its original position.

137
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:25,120
The sofa is not that heavy.

138
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,950
I was going to move it, but since you're at it,

139
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:29,580
can you move it over there?

140
00:08:29,580 --> 00:08:31,050
CEO, why are you doing this to me?

141
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:32,650
What do you mean by why?

142
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,970
What's wrong? Are your hands dirty with dust?

143
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:38,000
If you just move this just a little. Okay, I get it.

144
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,380
Wipe your hands and sit down.

145
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:45,250
- CEO! 
  - Ah! Here, too.

146
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,780
I need to take care of you.

147
00:08:46,780 --> 00:08:48,870
I-I need to take care of you.

148
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:52,730
My hand is better now.

149
00:08:52,730 --> 00:08:54,090
Let go.

150
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,300
Let's set Jeong Rok up with a blind date.

151
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,020
What? A blind date?

152
00:08:59,020 --> 00:09:03,020
You can heal a love wound by love.

153
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,610
It's an old method, but it does work.

154
00:09:06,610 --> 00:09:08,530
Still...

155
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,280
Would he be open to meet someone?

156
00:09:13,280 --> 00:09:17,550
That's why we should call him out to the blind date without him knowing.

157
00:09:17,550 --> 00:09:19,160
Without him knowing?

158
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,400
That's a little...

159
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:23,800
You said Jeong Rok is having a hard time.

160
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:28,150
Based on his personality, if nobody helps him, he'll continue to suffer alone.

161
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:32,410
I've looked around, and there's a junior of mine who is alright.

162
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,540
Coffee? Why do you want coffee suddenly?

163
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,590
Sure, I get it.

164
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:49,380
 Princess Oh Jin Sim 

165
00:09:52,540 --> 00:09:54,200
Yes, Oh Jin Sim.

166
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,000
Mr. Lawyer, what are you doing?

167
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,080
I was working.

168
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,080
Me, too.

169
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:02,500
I think filming will be done early today,

170
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:05,240
what should we do?

171
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:08,120
Well, to be honest, I have plans.

172
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:10,490
 Se Won asked me to get coffee with him. 

173
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,840
What? Coffee?

174
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,860
Why are you going to get coffee with someone you see day and night?

175
00:10:15,860 --> 00:10:20,180
It was a little unexpected, so I asked him what was going on, and he said that he was bored.

176
00:10:20,180 --> 00:10:23,330
Oh, because he is bored.

177
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:28,210
- Then, should I go with you? 
 - Pardon?

178
00:10:28,210 --> 00:10:33,940
Well, we only do dates every day at home, so it's a little suffocating.

179
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,890
And I haven't seen Prosecutor Se Won in a long time, so I want to see him.

180
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:39,690
And, if we met all three of us,

181
00:10:39,690 --> 00:10:43,030
even if someone sees us, it'll be no problem.

182
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:45,270
Then, should we do that?

183
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:51,410
Oh, Kim Se Won? I'm here. When are you coming?

184
00:10:51,410 --> 00:10:54,980
I'm not going today. To be honest, this is your blind date spot.

185
00:10:54,980 --> 00:10:57,070
What? A blind date?

186
00:10:57,070 --> 00:10:59,760
I've sent your picture to your blind date partner.

187
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,780
So, she'll recognize you.

188
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:04,300
I wish for your happiness, friend!

189
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,150
- Then, spend a good time. 
 - Hey! You!

190
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:08,680
Hello?

191
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,940
Kwon Jeong Rok?

192
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:13,390
Pardon?

193
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:20,080
You're much more handsome in person than your pictures.

194
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:23,710
Excuse me, I think something about this situation right now is a littleâ€”

195
00:11:23,710 --> 00:11:29,350
I was a little flustered when Unni Yeo Reum suddenly told me to meet with you today,

196
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:32,140
but I didn't know that such a cool person would come.

197
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:34,440
It seems like a good thing that I came to the blind date.

198
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,660
Are you having a blind date?

199
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:41,320
Yes, that, that is ... ah, how did you end up here?

200
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:48,160
I am sorry, but this man is mine.

201
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:51,440
Then, sorry to interrupt.

202
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:03,140
Really? Did a woman who resembles Oh Yoon Seo really come and take him away?

203
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:07,650
Don't tell me, the two of them are seeing each other again?

204
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:10,840
 Anyhow, do you think we made a big mistake? 

205
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:12,830
That could be.

206
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:17,130
Because of us, didn't the two of them have a big argument?

207
00:12:18,110 --> 00:12:22,230
I really didn't know. I never dreamed that situation was a blind date.

208
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:26,120
If I had known, would I have asked you to come there?

209
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,330
Of course, I am sorry I didn't tell Se Won we were seeing each other again,

210
00:12:30,330 --> 00:12:33,390
but I was going to see him and tell him today.

211
00:12:33,390 --> 00:12:36,900
I am very, very angry.

212
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:40,710
You are very, very handsome.

213
00:12:40,710 --> 00:12:43,360
I am sorry. Handsome ... ?

214
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,430
What? What's that mean?

215
00:12:45,430 --> 00:12:47,760
Earlier, were you listening to what that woman said?

216
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,040
She said you were way more handsome than your picture.

217
00:12:50,080 --> 00:12:53,780
I am sure she liked the picture.  You're actually more handsome than the picture.

218
00:12:53,850 --> 00:12:56,550
That makes me so nervous.

219
00:12:56,550 --> 00:13:01,810
I'm afraid that in the future you're going to be stealing women's hearts with your handsome face.

220
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:05,080
What does "stealing" mean?

221
00:13:05,130 --> 00:13:08,160
No, why are your proportions so uselessly perfect like this?

222
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:11,560
And your face is needlessly handsome.

223
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:14,140
Because you're not even a celebrity, your height is a waste.

224
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,130
Your face is a waste.  It's a total waste.

225
00:13:18,100 --> 00:13:21,460
Then, are you angry because of that?

226
00:13:21,460 --> 00:13:23,470
Yes.

227
00:13:23,470 --> 00:13:27,410
Then, what other reason would there be? What?

228
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,550
No, I thought you were upset about the blind date.

229
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:33,130
That's not a big deal.

230
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:37,800
I might not have understood what you said when you said to come out.

231
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:42,290
But if we didn't have at least that much trust in our relationship, what would that do?

232
00:13:43,630 --> 00:13:45,540
I'm so happy.

233
00:13:46,710 --> 00:13:48,750
- What?
 - I'm the one who feels uneasy,

234
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,870
because you're such an amazing person, Oh Jin Sim.

235
00:13:50,930 --> 00:13:54,530
I was severely abused by the CEO today when I told him I was in a romantic relationship with you.

236
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:56,950
Really? You were abused?

237
00:13:56,950 --> 00:14:00,400
Yes. So I was actually worried about the future.

238
00:14:00,450 --> 00:14:03,560
From now on, every man who finds out about our relationship will hate me.

239
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,120
And at that rate won't I indeed become the "nation's hated person"?

240
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:12,630
So when you tell me you are nervous, it's like the frying pan calling the kettle black.

241
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,160
Thank you.

242
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:21,490
For what?

243
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,870
Because from now on, no matter what happens,

244
00:14:23,870 --> 00:14:28,640
I think the two of us can overcome anything.

245
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,700
What? What do you mean the trip overseas will be brought forward?

246
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,600
There are still two weeks left.

247
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:52,050
No, the thing is, we just suddenly moved the date forward for the first broadcast.

248
00:14:52,050 --> 00:14:56,360
- Yes? 
 - So the location schedule must be adjusted a little.

249
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:59,590
Oh, that can't be.

250
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:02,470
But, Yoon Seo, I have good news in the midst of all this.

251
00:15:02,470 --> 00:15:05,170
We were originally supposed to be gone for three months.

252
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:06,920
But now that the date of the first broadcast is set,

253
00:15:06,920 --> 00:15:08,650
I don't think we can be shooting a long time  on location.

254
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:11,850
So they said we'll just film compactly for one month.

255
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:14,530
Ah, one month is long, too.

256
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:18,070
- Right? It's long, right?
 - So when are we leaving?

257
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:21,380
The flight is for tomorrow morning.

258
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,360
What? Tomorrow morning?

259
00:15:25,500 --> 00:15:28,940
What? You said you have a flight tomorrow morning at ten?

260
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:33,620
Then you're saying that there's only twenty hours left.

261
00:15:33,620 --> 00:15:35,370
First, I'll take half a day off.

262
00:15:35,370 --> 00:15:37,850
We have to be apart for a month.

263
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:40,780
Let's spend the remaining twenty hours with gusto.

264
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:51,390
CEO, I'm going to take half the day off today. Please allow it.

265
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,410
What's this? You've already gotten ready to leave, so why are you asking for permission?

266
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,130
Then I'll take that as you giving me permission and go now.

267
00:15:57,180 --> 00:16:00,770
What's so urgent that a person who never takes a day off in his life is suddenly taking the day off?

268
00:16:00,770 --> 00:16:02,720
Wait a second, Lawyer Kwon!

269
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:05,720
Are you perhaps going to meet with Yoon Seo?

270
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:07,880
Yes. That's right.

271
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:11,270
You definitely can't take a half day off. I can't allow it.

272
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:14,820
Wait, why are you suddenly saying you can't allow it?

273
00:16:14,820 --> 00:16:17,240
The image of you two together...

274
00:16:17,280 --> 00:16:21,410
Are you only in charge of one or two trials right now?

275
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,140
It doesn't matter if you're going to meet with Yoon Seo. I'm not doing it because I'm jealous.

276
00:16:25,140 --> 00:16:30,120
I'm someone who finds work important. I can't stand to see work being neglected.

277
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,160
- So don't go, Lawyer Kwon.
 - There will be no reason for you to see my work being neglected.

278
00:16:33,160 --> 00:16:36,340
I've already finished everything that's worth working on, and if there's something that I may have possibly missed,

279
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:40,160
I will take care of all of it by staying here all night starting tomorrow if I have to.

280
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,900
Fine.

281
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:48,930
Go, go.

282
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:53,100
Go. Aigo, since you're dating an actress, you're doing things that you've never done

283
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:55,400
and you've become the lead in a melodrama.

284
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:57,400
Go ahead.

285
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,460
Go ahead. Don't rush and drive safely and be care... Where did he go?

286
00:17:02,830 --> 00:17:04,690
- One moment.
- I'll see you tomorrow!

287
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:07,190
Mr. Lawyer!

288
00:17:07,190 --> 00:17:11,140
About the client of yours, Kwon Min Joo. One of his family members called.

289
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:14,270
They said that he was arrested without a warrant as a wanted suspect.

290
00:17:15,810 --> 00:17:18,040
Then I'll head right there,

291
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,050
so tell him not to make any statements until I get there.

292
00:17:21,050 --> 00:17:23,110
Yes, I will.

293
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:33,060
Really?

294
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:36,730
Well, there's nothing you can do about that. Alright, Mr. Lawyer.

295
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,200
Yes.

296
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:42,180
Why, why? Why? Did he say he can't meet with you because something with came up at work?

297
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,230
Yeah. One of his clients was arrested by the police as a wanted suspect,

298
00:17:45,230 --> 00:17:47,280
so he said he has to go take care of it.

299
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,800
The time that we can spend together is now...

300
00:17:51,850 --> 00:17:54,720
Only 19 hours are left!

301
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:57,040
What should you do?

302
00:17:58,290 --> 00:18:03,500
It's sad that the time we could spend together is just flying by.

303
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:09,520
And I feel bad because Mr. Lawyer has to take care of his cases without a secretary.

304
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:20,540
- Did you have a good trip?
 - Yes.

305
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:23,030
What happened? Did you meet with your client?

306
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,620
Yes. I've done the initial interview.

307
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:28,870
I'd like it if you could help me organize some documents.

308
00:18:28,870 --> 00:18:30,720
Kim Pil Gi, do you have time?

309
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,150
Yes. Ah, about that.

310
00:18:33,150 --> 00:18:37,240
Another secretary came to help you today.

311
00:18:37,240 --> 00:18:37,780
What?

312
00:18:37,780 --> 00:18:41,110
Your one-day secretary is waiting in your office.

313
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,350
One-day secretary?

314
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,670
Yes.

315
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:58,310
You're back, Mr. Lawyer?

316
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,000
Oh Jin Sim!

317
00:19:00,930 --> 00:19:02,280
How did you end up coming here?

318
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:05,370
What do you mean, how? I came to see you.

319
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:10,500
Now there are only eleven hours left that we can spend together.

320
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,860
Each minute and second is so precious, so I couldn't let it just pass by like this.

321
00:19:14,860 --> 00:19:18,140
So that we can be together, even if it's me helping you with your work,

322
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,240
I made a comeback as a secretary just for today like this.

323
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:23,060
Yes.

324
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:27,830
Alright. Then, what should I do from now on? Just say the word.

325
00:19:27,830 --> 00:19:31,230
You must have forgotten since it's been a long time, but that's my seat.

326
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:40,750
If you're going to leave tomorrow, then you should get some rest before you go.

327
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,730
I'm sorry for making you work like this.

328
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:46,140
Don't say things like that. I am okay.

329
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,720
I'll leave and go meet with a client for a moment.

330
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:56,420
Okay! I will finish all this up by the time you get back.

331
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,880
Okay!

332
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,550
My charger...

333
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,050
A charger? One moment!

334
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:09,400
Here.

335
00:20:11,980 --> 00:20:17,180
What do you think? It's just like me, who recharges your energy anytime and any place, isn't it?

336
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,450
Yes. It's amazing!

337
00:20:19,450 --> 00:20:22,470
- I'll share it with you.
 - Thank you.

338
00:20:26,750 --> 00:20:29,880
Did Jeong Rok really not say anything about me calling him out to a blind date?

339
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:33,530
I was also a little scared thinking of how angry such a prickly person like him would get,

340
00:20:33,530 --> 00:20:36,510
but he glossed over it more quietly than I thought.

341
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:39,830
I thought he would tell me to get out of his house or something.

342
00:20:39,830 --> 00:20:44,330
Goodness, that punk sometimes lords it over me that he's the owner of the house.

343
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,000
Then come out from there.

344
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,940
Forget it.

345
00:20:51,940 --> 00:20:54,620
The case that I've gotten this time is a real headache,

346
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:57,050
so I don't have time to go around looking for a house.

347
00:20:57,050 --> 00:20:59,530
But going back home because of that isn't good, either.

348
00:20:59,530 --> 00:21:02,270
Anyway, until all of the urgent matters are taken care of,

349
00:21:02,270 --> 00:21:06,910
I'll impose on him a little more. Isn't that what friends are for?

350
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:11,150
But still, I don't like it.

351
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,760
It's like you're uselessly chewing on a toothbrush.

352
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:16,330
If you've got the chance, you should only eat warm rice.

353
00:21:16,330 --> 00:21:17,920
There's a lot of rice at my house.

354
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:22,220
So there's a lot of rice at your house.

355
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:28,620
Wait, what's this? What you just saidâ€”

356
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:30,420
If you didn't get it, then forget about it.

357
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:32,660
No, I understood.

358
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:36,090
You're telling me to leave Jeong Rok's house and come to yours.

359
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:39,730
No, well... Since you told me to take responsibility

360
00:21:39,730 --> 00:21:42,230
since you can't go back home because of me.

361
00:21:43,430 --> 00:21:48,000
Ah, you're so amazing. I really like responsible women, you know.

362
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,300
Whats with that? Why are you acting like this?

363
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:52,410
That was a great answer.

364
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,610
You look so happy you could die.

365
00:22:03,610 --> 00:22:05,740
Yes. I'm so happy I could die.

366
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,710
But I'm planning on not dying and living a long, long time.

367
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:12,490
That way I can be happy with my Yeo Reum for a long time.

368
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:23,250
He got completely beaten by Jeong Rok in Im Yoon Hui's case,

369
00:22:23,250 --> 00:22:25,450
so he's been really listless these days.

370
00:22:25,450 --> 00:22:28,250
That makes me happy to hear.

371
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,440
Then I'm really going to your house.

372
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:37,230
Alright. Finish up with that headache of a case and then come to my house.

373
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:38,830
Okay.

374
00:22:41,580 --> 00:22:44,510
Yes, Oh Jin Sim. I finished with the consultation.

375
00:22:44,510 --> 00:22:48,920
I thought that you'd be hungry, so I came to buy some sandwiches. What would you like?

376
00:22:48,930 --> 00:22:51,420
Yes. Ah, one moment.

377
00:22:51,420 --> 00:22:54,380
One shrimp sandwich with avocado added on, please.

378
00:22:54,380 --> 00:22:55,840
- Yes.
 - Yes.

379
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,120
Yes.

380
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:00,650
Ah. Yes.

381
00:23:00,650 --> 00:23:03,030
I also miss you.

382
00:23:04,950 --> 00:23:06,970
I'll head back quickly. Yes.

383
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:14,840
I should be the one buying things like this as the secretary. I'm sorry.

384
00:23:16,890 --> 00:23:20,090
Mm, it's really good!

385
00:23:20,090 --> 00:23:22,760
I can tell by just looking at your expression.

386
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:26,660
What's wrong with my expression? Anyway, I'll eat it well.

387
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:30,270
But how long are you going to do this? Play secretary.

388
00:23:30,270 --> 00:23:33,690
What? What do you mean, play? I'm working so hard!

389
00:23:33,690 --> 00:23:36,580
Ah, yes. That's not what I'm saying.

390
00:23:36,580 --> 00:23:38,660
Give that to me! I'm confiscating your sandwich.

391
00:23:38,690 --> 00:23:40,180
I'm the one who bought it, though.

392
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:42,800
What's this? Yours looks better than mine.

393
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:48,450
Fine. Are all greedy people like that?

394
00:23:51,530 --> 00:23:54,150
Alright.

395
00:23:54,150 --> 00:23:58,750
Based on the data you compiled, I've completed the attorney's statement.

396
00:23:58,750 --> 00:24:03,330
With this, I think we will have a genuine review of the request for a warrant. Thank you for working so hard.

397
00:24:03,330 --> 00:24:05,830
Mr. Lawyer, you also worked hard.

398
00:24:05,850 --> 00:24:08,180
We finished sooner than I thought we would.

399
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,850
Yes. Then shall we begin dating in earnest from now on?

400
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:18,550
It's eight in the evening right now, so there's exactly fourteen hours left until 10 am tomorrow.

401
00:24:18,550 --> 00:24:21,540
Alright. Then for fourteen hours,

402
00:24:21,540 --> 00:24:23,650
let's have fun playing!

403
00:24:26,110 --> 00:24:29,310
Oh, one moment. Goodness.

404
00:24:30,810 --> 00:24:32,530
Yeah, Oppa?

405
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:38,600
What? A live internet broadcast?

406
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:42,520
What? Tonight at ten o'clock?

407
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:47,580
Wait, how could you schedule something so suddenly?

408
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:53,810
 It wasn't scheduled suddenly. It was scheduled a long time ago, but I forgot. 

409
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:58,090
 Yoon Seo, I'm sorry, but I think we'll have to leave now. 

410
00:24:58,090 --> 00:24:59,980
Wait.

411
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:04,100
Fine.

412
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:08,760
My goodness. Mr. Lawyer, I just don't know.

413
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:13,340
I think I have to leave because an event came up.

414
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:16,990
Well, I made a promise to do this live broadcast on the internet with my fans.

415
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,830
So I can't not go.

416
00:25:18,830 --> 00:25:22,640
Of course. You should keep your promise. Then get ready to go.

417
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,660
Just once.

418
00:25:35,390 --> 00:25:39,160
There are only twelve hours left. I want to see her.

419
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:50,340
 TvM Live Talk. 

420
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:52,790
Hello. I'm Oh Yoon Seo.

421
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:57,420
The drama that I ended up making a comeback in after a long time, Love Is A Painful Law, will soon air.

422
00:25:57,420 --> 00:26:00,330
Because I wanted to speak comfortably with everyone,

423
00:26:00,330 --> 00:26:02,480
I prepared a place like this.

424
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,640
I'm happy to see you!

425
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:12,230
Then, from now on, please ask any questions that you are curious about regarding me or the drama.

426
00:26:12,260 --> 00:26:14,360
Yes!!!

427
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:17,660
Shining Star Yoon Seo

428
00:26:17,660 --> 00:26:21,520
When do you leave for the overseas location shoot?

429
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:25,610
Actually, my schedule was pushed up a little,

430
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:29,660
so I ended up having to leave tomorrow.

431
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:32,300
Oh, that's right. I'm really sad about it, too.

432
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:34,360
Me, too.

433
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:39,180
Yes, I understand. As user I Gave My Entire Heart To Yoon Seo advised,

434
00:26:39,180 --> 00:26:43,700
I will take the necessary household medicines I need and be healthy on my trip.

435
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:47,000
I Gave My Entire Heart To Yoon Seo?

436
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:50,660
That's not possibly Yeon Joon Gyoo, right?

437
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:55,020
I will give you a quiz. To the person who gives the right answer,

438
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:58,700
I, Oh Yoon Seo, will personally give them a phone call.

439
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:01,600
Alright, then! I'm starting the quiz!

440
00:27:01,610 --> 00:27:03,650
Love is a painful law.

441
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:05,570
What is it about?

442
00:27:05,570 --> 00:27:09,640
 tvM's new drama series, "Love Is A Painful Law" is about the heroine, a female lawyer specializing in M &amp; A,  

443
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:13,230
 who goes to the Middle East on vacation and meets and falls in love with a judge advocate. 

444
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:17,520
 This romantic comedy is directed by Han Sang Cheol and written by Lee Se Jin, starring Oh Yoon Seo and Moon Ji Ho. 

445
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:22,240
 And the most important fact is that it premieres on  May 22 at 9:30 pm via livestream. 

446
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:28,050
Wow, they're coming in so fast!

447
00:27:28,830 --> 00:27:32,340
There's someone who really explained it accurately.

448
00:27:32,340 --> 00:27:34,830
- Mr. Bangbae-dong Hedgehog!
 - Yes!

449
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:38,090
 Mr. Bangbae-dong Hedgehog, by a secret chat  ... 
 - It's me. It's me. 

450
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:42,310
If you give me your phone number, my staff will call you right away.

451
00:27:42,310 --> 00:27:43,860
Yes.

452
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:47,910
Are we ready?

453
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:49,870
Yes. Alright.

454
00:27:49,870 --> 00:27:53,790
I'll answer the call. Hello?

455
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,040
Yes. Hello?

456
00:27:56,040 --> 00:28:00,320
Yes, hello, Mr. Bangbae-dong Hedgehog. Please introduce yourself first.

457
00:28:00,350 --> 00:28:04,340
I can't really expose my true identity.

458
00:28:04,340 --> 00:28:09,940
Like my ID, my nickname is Hedgehog, I live in Bangbae-dong, and I work as a lawyer.

459
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,050
You live in Bangbae-dong and work as a lawyer...

460
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,690
Mr. Hedgehog!

461
00:28:17,690 --> 00:28:21,450
Yes. I am Yoon Seo's big fan.

462
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:24,770
But actually my girlfriend also ended up

463
00:28:24,770 --> 00:28:27,550
leaving somewhere far away for a while.

464
00:28:27,550 --> 00:28:32,620
Since it was something that she really wanted to do and wished for,

465
00:28:32,620 --> 00:28:36,660
I wanted to tell her to be happy and healthy as she went.

466
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:41,540
I wanted to tell her that I would always be waiting here, in this place.

467
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,940
Yes.

468
00:28:43,590 --> 00:28:47,370
Mr. Bangbae-dong Hedgehog, your feelings

469
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:50,900
and sincerity will have gotten through to your girlfriend.

470
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:56,090
Yes. And, Ms. Oh Yoon Seo, please have a good filming trip.

471
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,890
My Goddess, Your Goddess, and the Universe's Goddess, Oh Yoon Seo!

472
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,790
I love you.

473
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:08,430
Yes. I also love you.

474
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:12,840
All of my fans. I love you!

475
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:16,020
 - She said she loves him!
 - Oh Yoon Seo loves me! 

476
00:29:16,020 --> 00:29:18,760
  - No, I'm the only one she loves. 
 - Honeycomb, I'm thrilled. 

477
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,680
 - My heart's evening affliction. 
 - I love Sken hedgehogs. 

478
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:24,320
 - I'm a woman too! 
 - I love you! 

479
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:26,710
 - She's so pretty. 
 - I'm the only one she loves 

480
00:29:26,710 --> 00:29:28,310
Yes, Mr. Lawyer.

481
00:29:28,310 --> 00:29:30,840
I just came home from the filming.

482
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,910
Yeah, I'm planning to wash up then go to sleep.

483
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:35,070
Yes, you worked hard today, too.

484
00:29:35,070 --> 00:29:36,380
I'm getting ready for work right now.

485
00:29:36,380 --> 00:29:39,130
Please think about me a lot today, too.

486
00:29:39,130 --> 00:29:44,380
Ah, then my work might come to a complete halt.

487
00:29:44,380 --> 00:29:46,710
Does the food suit your tastes?

488
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:48,630
You aren't tired from filming?

489
00:29:48,630 --> 00:29:51,620
The food is all really good.

490
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,340
And I'm a little tired,

491
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:59,280
but since you're my vitamin, my fatigue goes compleely away when you call. So I'm okay.

492
00:29:59,280 --> 00:30:01,880
Ah, right! You go to the Middle East tomorrow, right?

493
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:05,890
There's an important phrase that you need to memorize when you go.

494
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:08,400
Oh? What is that?

495
00:30:08,400 --> 00:30:12,210
Now let's try it.  Ladiya saedaikum.

496
00:30:12,210 --> 00:30:15,770
Ladiya saedaikum.

497
00:30:15,770 --> 00:30:16,980
What does that mean?

498
00:30:16,980 --> 00:30:19,790
It means, "I have a boyfriend."

499
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,100
No matter how much petroleum money he earns,

500
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:26,800
I hope you will discretely reject him in basic Arabic.

501
00:30:27,420 --> 00:30:31,660
â™«  I just wanna be your star for you  â™«

502
00:30:31,660 --> 00:30:34,290
â™«  It's contained in my hidden feelings  â™«

503
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,400
Oh Jin Sim! 
â™«  It's contained in my hidden feelings  â™«

504
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:39,900
I'm at the courthouse right now. 
â™«  I will shine on you.  â™«

505
00:30:39,900 --> 00:30:42,700
Look. You can see it, right? 
â™«   When you have a dark and tiring
  â™«

506
00:30:42,740 --> 00:30:44,130
Yes, I see it! 
â™«  day I will hug you.
  â™«

507
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:48,750
By the way, today I completely won the case I took for Heo Sang Kwon.

508
00:30:48,750 --> 00:30:51,780
It's a difficult case that all other law firms refused to take on,

509
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:54,510
but I took it on because the client kept asking me to.

510
00:30:54,530 --> 00:30:57,470
 But not only did I completely win the case, 

511
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:02,700
the judqe quoted what I wrote verbatim without changing a period

512
00:31:02,700 --> 00:31:05,500
 Isn't it really amazing? 

513
00:31:05,550 --> 00:31:08,510
Ah, yes. Thank you.

514
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:11,550
â™«  I am the person who will take care of you  â™«

515
00:31:11,550 --> 00:31:15,350
â™«  With my whole heart.  â™«

516
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:17,660
â™«  You know  â™«

517
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:25,100
â™«  I'm the person waiting for you.  â™«

518
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,130
Is that all your stuff?

519
00:31:48,010 --> 00:31:50,720
Yeah. It was like this when I came, too.

520
00:31:50,750 --> 00:31:55,040
Yeo Reum will go through some hardships from now on since she's living with you.

521
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,070
Anyway, thanks for all that time.

522
00:31:57,070 --> 00:32:01,450
I'll stay at Yeo Reum's house with her for now and then look for my own house once all the urgent things are taken care of.

523
00:32:01,450 --> 00:32:03,580
I'll have a housewarming party then.

524
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:04,620
Whatever.

525
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:09,320
- Just make sure that you don't cry because I'm not here.
 - Bug off.

526
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:10,850
I'm going.

527
00:32:12,380 --> 00:32:14,630
You don't need to walk me out. Yeo Reum will be here.

528
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:16,480
I'm going to say hey to Yeo Reum.

529
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,960
Really?

530
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,810
So you were at home, Jeong Rok.

531
00:32:28,830 --> 00:32:31,060
Yeah. I wanted to rest on the weekend.

532
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:33,940
That's right. You should rest on the weekend.

533
00:32:33,940 --> 00:32:35,480
Is this all your stuff?

534
00:32:35,480 --> 00:32:37,130
Don't you know that minimalism is a trend?

535
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,990
Yes, please put it in the trunk.

536
00:32:43,490 --> 00:32:45,140
Now you should be the one to suffer.

537
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,100
That's right. You went through a lot all that time.

538
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:55,370
Go back in. Ah, I think I'm going to cry for no reason.

539
00:32:55,370 --> 00:32:57,930
Go on. Drive carefully.

540
00:32:57,930 --> 00:32:59,450
We're going. See you later.

541
00:32:59,450 --> 00:33:01,070
I'm going.

542
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:04,500
Be well.

543
00:33:35,110 --> 00:33:38,230
I wish Oh Jin Sim would come back quickly.

544
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:44,160
There are still five days left.

545
00:34:02,670 --> 00:34:05,030
Yes, Oh Jin Sim.

546
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,750
I was writing a summary just now.

547
00:34:07,750 --> 00:34:11,940
It's morning there, isn't it?  Did you sleep well?  Did you have a good dream?

548
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:17,400
But why does your voice sound ...

549
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,110
Did something happen?

550
00:34:19,110 --> 00:34:23,990
 It is, Mr. Lawyer, please don't misunderstand. 

551
00:34:23,990 --> 00:34:25,180
You say misunderstand ...

552
00:34:25,180 --> 00:34:30,310
 No. An article just exploded! I am also so taken aback. 

553
00:34:30,310 --> 00:34:33,750
 But I'm afraid more than anything you will misunderstand. I'm worried most about that. 

554
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:36,590
 But then, no way. 

555
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:41,060
 I'm sorry, but there are so many calls from reporters,  

556
00:34:41,060 --> 00:34:42,980
 I think I have to turn off my phone. 

557
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:47,200
 Since I'll call again and tell you all the details, can you never ever get me wrong?  

558
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:51,100
Yes. You ... Oh Jin Sim ...

559
00:34:53,680 --> 00:34:55,590
Article?

560
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:10,200
 Did Oh Yoon Seo and Moon Ji Hoo have a secret date at the mall? 

561
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:26,500
It was a relief to hear you were eating well and doing well.

562
00:35:27,420 --> 00:35:30,130
Doesn't the food suit your taste?

563
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:33,850
You look a little tired.

564
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:55,020
I'll leave first.

565
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,740
Did you see? Did you see? Did you see he's ready to lose his temper?

566
00:35:59,740 --> 00:36:03,020
Of course, we saw?  What on earth happened?

567
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:06,120
Looking at the picture, the atmosphere is not that bad.

568
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:09,840
Although Secretary Oh is not that kind of person, the picture looks so real.

569
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,050
Right.  Hasn't that become shopping for affection?

570
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:14,100
I'm very disappointed in Oh Yoon Seo.

571
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:16,870
She never went shopping with me.

572
00:36:16,870 --> 00:36:18,920
What do you mean?

573
00:36:18,920 --> 00:36:22,880
So, did anything happen?  I mean, c'mon.

574
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,000
I don't think it's true.

575
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,490
Just a few days ago, Lawyer Kwon had a very affectionate phone call with her.

576
00:36:28,490 --> 00:36:31,810
And Oh Yoon Seo really likes Lawyer Kwon.

577
00:36:31,810 --> 00:36:34,600
You can't change your mind so rapidly.

578
00:36:34,600 --> 00:36:41,000
I can't say.  The decline in someone's affection cannot be measured precisely with a ruler.

579
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:44,500
Did love appear to move without a reason?

580
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:51,000
Could Oh Yoon Seo's love have moved from Lawyer Kwon to the male actor?

581
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,590
Lawyer Choi, are you taking good care of Lawyer Dan?

582
00:36:54,590 --> 00:36:58,710
I've never seen a persons' love move as well as Lawyer Dan's when she falls in love so quickly.

583
00:36:58,710 --> 00:37:03,250
At its most severe, I've seen her fall in love three times in one day.

584
00:37:03,250 --> 00:37:05,310
In one morning.

585
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:10,100
That was in the past.  Now that she met me,

586
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:13,600
that will never ever happen.

587
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:18,080
Anyway, whether it is true or not

588
00:37:18,080 --> 00:37:22,180
how would our Lawyer Kwon feel when his girlfriend had an article like that come out?

589
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:27,000
Anyway, for now, let's pretend we don't know about it. Okay?

590
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,500
Yes.

591
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:35,890
What are you doing, CEO?

592
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:38,170
Come here. Come here. Look there. Look, look!

593
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:42,620
I mean Lawyer Kwon.  He looks totally ready to tear up the documents.

594
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:45,300
It seems like he's doing that because he's angry about the dating rumors, doesn't it?

595
00:37:45,300 --> 00:37:48,930
I'm not sure. It also seems like he's doing it because the document pages aren't flipping easily.

596
00:37:48,930 --> 00:37:53,620
No, if he was doing that, he would be using a rubber finger tip and let go smoothly.

597
00:37:53,620 --> 00:37:56,100
There's no way that brilliant mind wouldn't know how to do that.

598
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:59,960
This is definitely him taking out his angry feelings towards Yoon Seo

599
00:37:59,960 --> 00:38:02,940
on those documents. Right?

600
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,470
You told us to pretend we didn't know anything.

601
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:05,730
Yeah.

602
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,220
That's right.

603
00:38:18,610 --> 00:38:20,870
Wait, wait. Look.

604
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:25,220
You saw that, right? You saw it, right? You saw that?

605
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,090
He wants to beat up the actor that's next to Yoon Seo, but since he can't do that,

606
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,860
he's taking his revenge ( boksu )  out on the copier ( boksa )  machine instead.

607
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,510
Does he still not look angry, even though he's doing that?

608
00:38:33,510 --> 00:38:36,520
Aigo, goodness. You said that we should pretend we don't know anything!

609
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:41,030
I also want to pretend that I don't know. But what can I do when I'm so upset?

610
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:44,860
You know that I wished for their happiness more than anyone else.

611
00:38:44,860 --> 00:38:47,350
Did you? I didn't know at all.

612
00:38:47,350 --> 00:38:49,370
Yes.

613
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,670
Ah, he left.

614
00:38:55,640 --> 00:38:58,940
Is he okay or is he mad? I can't tell

615
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:01,810
how that Bangbae-dong Hedgehog feels.

616
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:04,460
Bangbae-dong Hedgehog?

617
00:39:04,460 --> 00:39:06,650
Yeah. there's something like that.

618
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:15,020
Lawyer Dan, what do you want to eat? Let's eat something that you want to eat.

619
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:16,530
Hello.  May I help you?  Welcome.

620
00:39:16,530 --> 00:39:18,230
I want to eat udon today! Udon.

621
00:39:18,230 --> 00:39:20,560
Udon?

622
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,690
It must be a popular restaurant.

623
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:29,300
 At its most severe, I've seen Lawyer Dan fall in love three times in one day. 

624
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:31,300
 In one morning. 

625
00:39:31,300 --> 00:39:34,490
We can't have udon. Let's eat something else.

626
00:39:34,490 --> 00:39:36,000
Why?

627
00:39:44,830 --> 00:39:47,410
Hello, Grandmother. It's a grandmother.

628
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:49,830
 Grandma's Blood Sausage Soup 

629
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,400
Would you like to order?

630
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,390
 Three times in one day... three times... three times... 

631
00:39:57,390 --> 00:40:01,340
What should we eat?

632
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:05,200
Oh, one moment. I'll come back after I answer the phone, Lawyer Dan.

633
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,120
Here.

634
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,680
That's my contact information.

635
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:19,530
 Like Lawyer Dan, who falls in love so easily... 

636
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:25,330
We were eating and suddenly you said you had something to tell me?

637
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:30,050
Lawyer Dan, how can you do this? Even if you do fall in love easily,

638
00:40:30,050 --> 00:40:34,330
how could you give your number to another man in front of your boyfriend? How could you?

639
00:40:34,330 --> 00:40:37,730
What? What do you...?

640
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:42,890
Are you perhaps talking about me giving my number to the part-time worker at Grandma's Blood Sausage Soup restaurant?

641
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:43,870
Yes!

642
00:40:43,870 --> 00:40:46,790
And here I thought...

643
00:40:46,790 --> 00:40:49,830
They said that they also package and deliver the blood sausage soup,

644
00:40:49,830 --> 00:40:52,510
so I wrote down my address and phone number and gave it to him.

645
00:40:52,510 --> 00:40:57,060
I was going to give it to you as a present because I thought you liked blood sausage soup.

646
00:40:57,060 --> 00:41:01,330
Ah, th-that's... What did you say?

647
00:41:01,330 --> 00:41:06,080
Lawyer Choi, I see you don't really trust me.

648
00:41:06,080 --> 00:41:10,660
It's to be expected, since I did show you that side of me.

649
00:41:11,390 --> 00:41:14,790
Lawyer Dan, that's not it.

650
00:41:14,790 --> 00:41:18,390
But, you know, you don't have to worry about things like that anymore.

651
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,280
I am a person who falls in love easily and really, really quickly,

652
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:26,120
but now I'm only falling in love quickly and continuously

653
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:28,700
with one person, you see.

654
00:41:28,700 --> 00:41:31,280
Wh-What does that mean?

655
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,420
When I see your smile, Lawyer Choi,

656
00:41:36,420 --> 00:41:39,860
I fall in love with you because it's sweet.

657
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:43,340
When I see you heading to work in the morning with your hair wet,

658
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:46,720
I fall in love with you because it's sexy.

659
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:52,880
Like that, I fall in love with you ten times a day

660
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:57,010
so I don't have space to fall in love with anyone else.

661
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:03,850
Lawyer Dan. No, Moon Hui.

662
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:09,160
Lawyer Choi. No, Oppa Yoon Hyeok.

663
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,860
Moon Hui!

664
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:21,730
What are those two doing out here?

665
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:24,780
Wow. Awe-some.

666
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,940
So we were at the park.

667
00:42:44,150 --> 00:42:45,950
Should I change departments?

668
00:42:45,950 --> 00:42:49,000
Why? Did the chief say something?

669
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,980
No. I'm just saying.

670
00:42:51,980 --> 00:42:55,050
Should I go somewhere less intense?

671
00:42:55,050 --> 00:42:58,530
Hm? Why, all of a sudden?

672
00:42:58,530 --> 00:43:00,940
It's just that

673
00:43:00,940 --> 00:43:05,830
you're busy, and I'm busy too. It's hard for us to spend time together.

674
00:43:06,570 --> 00:43:11,310
If you succeed and get to the top, even if that's what you want

675
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:14,730
my happiness is here.

676
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:20,800
And, I feel like I have a successful life at this point.

677
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:24,620
Tomorrow is the weekend. Shall we go watch a movie for the first time in a long time?

678
00:43:24,620 --> 00:43:26,150
Is there something you want to see?

679
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,080
Um... Hm.

680
00:43:29,080 --> 00:43:34,460
Ah, this won't do. I have to go look at houses tomorrow because my lease is expired here.

681
00:43:40,720 --> 00:43:44,770
Wow, it seems like the reporters haven't caught on that you're coming back at all.

682
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,860
This is the first time we've gotten out of the airport so quickly.

683
00:43:48,830 --> 00:43:52,360
What is it? Who are you calling so urgently like that since earlier?

684
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:54,470
What? Is it Mr. Lawyer?

685
00:43:55,400 --> 00:43:58,330
What should I do, Oppa? Mr. Lawyer won't pick up the phone.

686
00:43:58,330 --> 00:44:00,210
He must be really angry because of the dating rumor.

687
00:44:00,210 --> 00:44:01,710
Hey, no way!

688
00:44:01,710 --> 00:44:05,060
But, honestly, if you look at the pictures then it's reasonable to misunderstand it.

689
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,160
We all went together, so why did they only take a picture of us two, seriously?

690
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,960
This won't do, Oppa. I have to go meet Mr. Lawyer right now.

691
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,780
You can't. No! Oh Yoon Seo, you can't.

692
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:18,090
You don't know where paparazzi may be hiding right now.

693
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,870
Instead of acting impulsively, go straight home for today.

694
00:44:23,840 --> 00:44:26,030
You're so mean.

695
00:44:27,030 --> 00:44:30,030
 Thank you to the entire Sincerely Yours Team 

696
00:44:30,030 --> 00:44:32,970
 Thank you to Channel Manager, Dudie 

697
00:44:32,970 --> 00:44:35,960
 Thank you to segmenters: marykarmelina, dudie, bjohnsonwong, dasfl49, s14950, nicefly09 

698
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:39,170
 Thank you to segmenters: marisol_inf, earsds, nmelova, hana860, cgwm808 and miller19970320 

699
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:43,030
 Thank you to English to Korean subtitlers: cherae_lynn, cgwm808,  2foreverdream, juliaky09, lk808,   

700
00:44:43,030 --> 00:44:46,400
 Thank you to English  to Korean subtitlers, cont: minji_kim_2, aeri_y, ananasku, and phillygirl 315 

701
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,500
Ta-da!

702
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:52,320
Oh! Mr. Lawyer! Mr. Lawyer, how did you get here?

703
00:44:52,320 --> 00:44:55,800
This is what you call a surprise.

704
00:44:55,800 --> 00:45:00,530
I heard from your manager that your flight got moved up, and I wanted to surprise you.

705
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,540
He keeps secrets better than I thought.

706
00:45:03,540 --> 00:45:06,870
So that's why Oppa Joon Hyeok kept telling me to go home.

707
00:45:06,870 --> 00:45:12,260
Ah, what's this? I didn't know that and thought that you were angry!

708
00:45:12,260 --> 00:45:15,650
How could I be? How could our relationship not have that amount of trust?

709
00:45:17,130 --> 00:45:21,520
Oh right, I bought a present to give to you.

710
00:45:23,900 --> 00:45:26,670
This. Open it.

711
00:45:26,670 --> 00:45:30,690
I wanted to give you this perfume I like.

712
00:45:31,450 --> 00:45:34,180
Should we try spraying it now?

713
00:45:35,740 --> 00:45:39,690
 Thank you to Editors: cgwm808 (Chief) and Joysprite 

714
00:45:40,880 --> 00:45:43,560
How is it? Smells good, right?

715
00:45:50,400 --> 00:45:54,590
Then, should we try doing what we weren't able to for a month?

716
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:00,470
What do you mean...

717
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:06,290
I mean script practice. What are you thinking of?

718
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:08,490
Eh?

719
00:46:09,670 --> 00:46:10,970
It's a joke.

720
00:46:10,970 --> 00:46:15,040
What are you doing, I was startled.

721
00:46:16,720 --> 00:46:18,920
I really really missed you.

722
00:46:18,920 --> 00:46:22,220
Me too, really missed you.

723
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:24,520
Really.

724
00:46:27,050 --> 00:46:30,020
What? They can't release a correction article?

725
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,300
But why? Why not?

726
00:46:32,300 --> 00:46:34,320
Think about it, Yoon Seo.

727
00:46:34,320 --> 00:46:36,490
There's not even a week left till the first episode of our drama airs.

728
00:46:36,490 --> 00:46:39,760
But if you say there's no relationship between you  two now,

729
00:46:39,760 --> 00:46:41,970
would the viewers be engrossed in watching it?

730
00:46:41,970 --> 00:46:45,180
We have to build up the chemistry between the male and female leads, confuse them about whether it's reality or fiction,

731
00:46:45,180 --> 00:46:48,500
and introduce it with a bang to make it a hit in viewership ratings.

732
00:46:48,500 --> 00:46:51,470
Why are you doing this knowing that?

733
00:46:51,470 --> 00:46:57,040
- But stillâ€”
 - Stop. Talks with Moon Ji Hoo's agency are complete.

734
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:59,700
Since a scandal came out before it even began, they feel a little displeased,

735
00:46:59,700 --> 00:47:02,590
but they said that a crisis is an opportunity.

736
00:47:02,590 --> 00:47:04,980
Since we've got their attention,

737
00:47:04,980 --> 00:47:09,240
let's not confirm or deny until the drama ends.

738
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:14,660
President! I'm not ignorant of the situation, but

739
00:47:14,660 --> 00:47:17,470
if we don't release a correction article about the relationship between Moon Ji Hoo and I,

740
00:47:17,470 --> 00:47:19,870
won't the whole world misunderstand?

741
00:47:19,870 --> 00:47:22,180
Then, my real boyfriend,

742
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:24,300
how hurt would he feel?

743
00:47:24,300 --> 00:47:26,480
Right, your friend, what friend?

744
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,420
- Boyfriend. 
 - Right, boyfriend.

745
00:47:28,420 --> 00:47:31,210
Your boyfriend's perspective is understandâ€” What friend did you say?

746
00:47:31,210 --> 00:47:33,800
- Lover, lover. 
 - Lover, sorry.

747
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:35,520
Your lovâ€”

748
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:37,610
You have a lover?!

749
00:47:38,950 --> 00:47:41,300
- Yes. 
 - Yessss?!

750
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:47,270
Secretary Yang, please verify this. Is your address correct?

751
00:47:47,270 --> 00:47:50,630
Yes, but why my address suddenly?

752
00:47:50,630 --> 00:47:53,020
The acting agency is having their 10th-anniversary party.

753
00:47:53,020 --> 00:47:55,160
They're inviting us all since we're a partner law firm,

754
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,150
and they need to send the invitation cards.

755
00:47:58,150 --> 00:48:00,480
We get to visit a place like thanks to Yoon Seo.

756
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:05,430
Exactly. All the agency actors will also attend. I'm so excited.

757
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:09,420
But Office Manager Lee's house address seems to be wrong.

758
00:48:09,420 --> 00:48:11,560
He lives in Jangchung-dong, not Shingil-dong.

759
00:48:11,560 --> 00:48:14,230
He actually moved to Shingil-dong.

760
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,410
It's been 3-4 months as far as I know.

761
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:19,120
What?

762
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,080
Oh, President Yeon, hello.

763
00:48:21,080 --> 00:48:22,390
Joon Gyoo Hyung is inside, right?

764
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:25,240
Yes, he is inside. The addressâ€”

765
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:28,090
Let's talk next time.

766
00:48:28,090 --> 00:48:29,600
Next.

767
00:48:33,100 --> 00:48:37,000
So you knew that Kwon Jeong Rok was dating our Yoon Seo?!

768
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:42,000
Yep. But Yoon Seo asked me to keep it a secret.

769
00:48:42,030 --> 00:48:44,990
That's why I wasn't able to say anything.

770
00:48:45,000 --> 00:48:48,600
So the romance rumor is happening?

771
00:48:48,600 --> 00:48:51,200
What a relief, I worried a lot.

772
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,200
Is that important right now?

773
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,800
I'm so displeased, seriously.

774
00:48:54,850 --> 00:48:57,860
No, the reason I sent Yoon Seo to your law firm,

775
00:48:57,860 --> 00:49:01,180
wasn't so that you could take care of her instead of me.

776
00:49:01,180 --> 00:49:04,660
I wanted her to get real training in the office, not real dating experience!

777
00:49:04,660 --> 00:49:06,560
Then would I like this situation?

778
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:08,870
You know, I'm a fan of Yoon Seo's.

779
00:49:08,870 --> 00:49:11,930
Am I a regular fan? When I first heard this news,

780
00:49:11,930 --> 00:49:14,670
I couldn't sleep day or night, out of despair.

781
00:49:14,670 --> 00:49:16,680
It was unfair and infuriating.

782
00:49:16,680 --> 00:49:19,490
But what can I do? Yoon Seo is also a person.

783
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:22,530
You can't do anything about someone liking someone else.

784
00:49:22,530 --> 00:49:26,400
Even as a management company president, you can't control emotions.

785
00:49:26,400 --> 00:49:29,680
Then what should we do? Just acknowledge and accept it,

786
00:49:29,680 --> 00:49:31,270
and support them going forward.

787
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:34,610
Fine, let's say I concede 100% and support our Yoon Seo dating.

788
00:49:34,610 --> 00:49:37,460
But I don't like the other party, Kwon Jeong Rok, or whatever.

789
00:49:37,460 --> 00:49:39,760
You said Hyung, he's a giant jerk.

790
00:49:39,800 --> 00:49:41,500
Yeah, he is kind of a jerk.

791
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:45,200
What a wolf-like character. He took our innocent Yoon Seo,

792
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:47,400
twisted and blinded her with love?

793
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,930
Ah, that sneaky man.

794
00:49:48,930 --> 00:49:50,780
You don't know this but,

795
00:49:50,780 --> 00:49:54,800
If there is a second innocent person, it is our naive Lawyer Kwon.

796
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:56,650
He only studied in his school days,

797
00:49:56,650 --> 00:49:59,860
he never even held a girl's hand. He's never dated.

798
00:49:59,860 --> 00:50:03,130
I don't like that even more! He just sat and studied?

799
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:05,480
Just like a flower raised in a greenhouse, yeah, yeah.

800
00:50:05,480 --> 00:50:08,980
Our Yoon Seo survived from being on the brink of a cliff.

801
00:50:08,980 --> 00:50:12,300
She's someone who survived with her mental strength even in the midst of all those numerous criticisms and bad comments!

802
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:15,660
Jeong Rok is the ultimate survivor of blame and viciousness!

803
00:50:15,660 --> 00:50:17,450
Don't you remember the Park Soo Myeong incident?

804
00:50:17,450 --> 00:50:20,260
The whole country labeled him a troublemaker

805
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,260
and targeted him with malicious comment after comment after comment for that incident.

806
00:50:22,260 --> 00:50:26,620
If you just count the numbers of bad comments, then Yoon Seo falls far behind him.

807
00:50:26,620 --> 00:50:30,290
Our Yoon Seo, if you want to nitpick over bad acting, scandal, bad conduct, drama malicious comments,

808
00:50:30,290 --> 00:50:33,030
is an Olympic gold medalist.

809
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,490
Kim Yeon A's triple axel? We're triple the maliciousness!

810
00:50:35,490 --> 00:50:37,610
And our Yoon Seo is a top star among stars.

811
00:50:37,610 --> 00:50:41,180
Our Kwon Jeong Rok is the top lawyer at Always Law Firm.

812
00:50:41,180 --> 00:50:43,740
Our Yoon Seo is a goddess! How pretty is she?

813
00:50:43,740 --> 00:50:45,960
Our Kwon Jeong Rok, maybe not as much as me,

814
00:50:45,960 --> 00:50:47,610
but how handsome is he?

815
00:50:47,610 --> 00:50:50,850
If he's not even up to your level, isn't he screwed?

816
00:50:51,810 --> 00:50:53,890
Do you want a piece of my mind?

817
00:50:53,890 --> 00:50:56,950
I'm not! Our Lawyer Kwon is so good at defending.

818
00:50:56,950 --> 00:50:59,330
It's okay to hit someone.  Our Lawyer Kwon will take care of everything for you.

819
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,220
There should a CCTV here, right?

820
00:51:01,220 --> 00:51:03,080
Here, here.

821
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:05,500
What is that?  Your belly button?

822
00:51:05,500 --> 00:51:07,600
It's a Pooh limited edition.

823
00:51:07,600 --> 00:51:09,730
- What Pooh? 
 - Pooh.

824
00:51:09,730 --> 00:51:12,560
He moved? That's not...

825
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:16,100
We just met yesterday on the bus.

826
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:27,930
Secretary Yang, tomorrow's plan to eat dinner together,

827
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:30,220
you remember, right?

828
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:35,150
Well, there's no way you could forget, I ask so many times a day.

829
00:51:36,600 --> 00:51:40,210
Office Manager, is it alright if I ask you something?

830
00:51:40,210 --> 00:51:42,830
Yes, ask anything.

831
00:51:42,830 --> 00:51:45,550
I heard you moved three months ago.

832
00:51:45,550 --> 00:51:49,840
Then how could we meet on the same bus every day?

833
00:51:52,460 --> 00:51:54,320
That...

834
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:07,450
 Secretary Yang. We're here. 

835
00:52:07,450 --> 00:52:09,250
 Omo! 

836
00:52:09,250 --> 00:52:10,300
 We're here. 

837
00:52:10,300 --> 00:52:13,610
 Oh, already. Thank you. 

838
00:52:13,610 --> 00:52:17,990
If I wasn't there, I didn't think anyone would be there to wake you up.

839
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:21,880
I wanted to let you rest comfortably on the bus at least.

840
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:23,760
That's why I did that.

841
00:52:41,610 --> 00:52:44,080
Is this the house you found out about?

842
00:52:44,080 --> 00:52:46,260
Yeah, how is it?

843
00:52:46,960 --> 00:52:51,120
It's too big.  It's way over our budget.

844
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:55,490
I already reserved it though.

845
00:52:55,490 --> 00:52:56,640
What?

846
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,900
Let's get married and live here.

847
00:53:03,770 --> 00:53:06,560
I chose a place with big windows because you like bright places.

848
00:53:06,560 --> 00:53:10,800
Let's put a sofa here, and a TV there.

849
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:14,670
I should watch movies on weekends leaning against your knees.

850
00:53:16,910 --> 00:53:19,910
And I'm going to put a big dining table there.

851
00:53:19,910 --> 00:53:22,810
We're going to have a big family.

852
00:53:22,810 --> 00:53:28,050
A son who resembles you, and a daughter who resembles you.

853
00:53:28,050 --> 00:53:30,270
Kim Se Won.

854
00:53:47,270 --> 00:53:52,980
The only response you can give is, I'll marry you.

855
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:57,790
I won't listen to anything else you say.

856
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:05,940
I'll marry you.

857
00:54:21,530 --> 00:54:26,340
My happiness is also here. It's you.

858
00:54:44,710 --> 00:54:47,700
Welcome! Is it just you two?

859
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,600
Welcome. Is it just two of you?

860
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:09,970
Welcome!

861
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:25,470
The flowers are really pretty.

862
00:55:30,040 --> 00:55:34,250
I think that love is like flowers.

863
00:55:34,250 --> 00:55:38,470
It's beautiful and pretty, but it wilts away really quickly.

864
00:55:38,470 --> 00:55:42,960
So it's a flower that has much more that it has to endure.

865
00:55:45,730 --> 00:55:47,510
I've always decided

866
00:55:47,510 --> 00:55:50,820
that if love came to me again,

867
00:55:50,820 --> 00:55:55,110
I would pretend that I don't see it and just pass it by.

868
00:55:58,790 --> 00:56:01,250
- Office Manager.
 - Yes?

869
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:04,450
Please don't like me.

870
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:10,150
I came to say that today.

871
00:56:10,150 --> 00:56:15,820
To tell you to meet a better person instead of someone like me.

872
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:17,900
I came to say this.

873
00:56:22,360 --> 00:56:25,450
I'm really thankful to you

874
00:56:25,450 --> 00:56:27,930
for treating me so warmly all this time.

875
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,660
I brought chicken.

876
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:55,480
Since today is your drama's first airing,

877
00:56:55,480 --> 00:56:58,320
I thought it would be nice to watch it together while having chicken and beer.

878
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,600
Ah, yes. Sounds good.

879
00:57:03,310 --> 00:57:04,810
Ah. Come in.

880
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:06,190
Alright.

881
00:57:08,220 --> 00:57:09,680
 Have you ever been to the art museum? 

882
00:57:09,680 --> 00:57:12,800
 If you are doing a good job at work, do you know what is happening? 

883
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:18,300
Alright.

884
00:57:23,130 --> 00:57:24,880
Are you nervous?

885
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:28,340
Oh. No.

886
00:57:28,370 --> 00:57:32,060
I'm an actress who debuted fifteen years ago.

887
00:57:45,450 --> 00:57:49,100
I understand that it's the moment that you've been waiting for so desperately.

888
00:57:49,100 --> 00:57:53,270
Thank you for experiencing such an important moment with me.

889
00:57:53,960 --> 00:57:56,380
Me, too.

890
00:57:56,380 --> 00:57:58,860
Ah, it's playing!

891
00:58:01,080 --> 00:58:05,630
Wow. You look really pretty.

892
00:58:07,250 --> 00:58:11,260
The return of the rom-com queen, Oh Yoon Seo, has a successful comeback!

893
00:58:11,260 --> 00:58:13,650
Wow, the article has a really good title.

894
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:17,720
A lot of people  can leave comments now.

895
00:58:17,720 --> 00:58:21,460
Oh, what should I do, Mr. Lawyer? I'm nervous. Should I just not look at them?

896
00:58:21,460 --> 00:58:25,120
No, should I look at them? Or should I not look at them?

897
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:33,210
No.  It's the leading actor's duty to humbly accept the viewers' responses.

898
00:58:36,570 --> 00:58:38,140
Ah, I can't do it!

899
00:58:38,140 --> 00:58:43,800
Then I'll look first and tell you if you can look or not.

900
00:58:46,680 --> 00:58:48,630
- No, this is...
- Why?

901
00:58:48,630 --> 00:58:50,160
Is it really bad?

902
00:58:50,190 --> 00:58:51,950
Did they say that they want to report me?

903
00:58:51,950 --> 00:58:55,530
The comments are really, really good!

904
00:58:55,530 --> 00:59:00,120
- What?
 - Oh Yoon Seo's acting has really improved. It's so nice to see Yoon Seo on the screen.

905
00:59:00,120 --> 00:59:02,790
My goddess Oh Yeon Seo is spreading beauty throughout the universe.

906
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:06,270
The controversy over her acting is over.

907
00:59:06,290 --> 00:59:08,760
The chemistry between the male and female lead is out of this world. It's as if they're really dating.

908
00:59:13,650 --> 00:59:17,080
You worked hard! I'll just say cheers. Alright, cheers!

909
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:19,120
Cheers!

910
00:59:19,150 --> 00:59:22,030
- Alright, you worked hard!
 - You worked hard!

911
00:59:22,030 --> 00:59:25,500
Ah, you did such a good job, Yoon Seo. Thank you.

912
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:29,850
One, two, three.

913
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:40,030
Alright, everyone. We can't not let our main actress Oh Yoon Seo give a comment, right?

914
00:59:40,030 --> 00:59:41,160
- Yes!
 - Applause!

915
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,040
Oh Yoon Seo! Oh Yoon Seo! Oh Yoon Seo!

916
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:47,210
- Oh Yoon Seo! Oh Yoon...
- Shh!!!

917
00:59:48,670 --> 00:59:55,690
Thank you for welcoming me so happily as I made my comeback like this.

918
00:59:55,690 --> 01:00:00,640
For a long time, as I was preparing for my comeback,

919
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:07,840
I was always hoping that my sincerity would touch many people.

920
01:00:07,840 --> 01:00:11,720
It feels like that hope has been fulfilled a little,

921
01:00:11,720 --> 01:00:15,660
so I'm really honored and happy.

922
01:00:15,660 --> 01:00:17,500
Thank you.

923
01:00:27,290 --> 01:00:29,570
Alright.

924
01:00:29,570 --> 01:00:34,200
Yoon Seo, earlier you expressed your feeling.

925
01:00:34,200 --> 01:00:38,030
Not again.  Don't cry.  Don't cry.

926
01:00:38,030 --> 01:00:41,120
I'm really all choked up.

927
01:00:41,120 --> 01:00:43,530
You worked hard.

928
01:00:50,170 --> 01:00:53,460
- So that's why I'm saying this, CEO.
 - Yeah?

929
01:00:53,460 --> 01:00:55,430
Now,

930
01:00:56,050 --> 01:00:58,360
I want to do what I want to do.

931
01:00:58,360 --> 01:01:00,190
Do what?

932
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,880
I'm saying that I'm going to quit all dramas

933
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:08,270
and I'm going to follow my heart.

934
01:01:08,270 --> 01:01:10,050
Huh?

935
01:01:10,060 --> 01:01:11,290
I'm leaving.

936
01:01:11,290 --> 01:01:15,670
Yoon Seo.  Don't get into trouble. Yoon Seo! Hey!

937
01:01:15,670 --> 01:01:18,260
CEO.  Please have a glass.

938
01:01:18,260 --> 01:01:20,370
Oh, alright. Yeah.

939
01:01:20,390 --> 01:01:23,680
Goodness, that girl. Hey, what are you doing?

940
01:01:23,680 --> 01:01:25,800
- I'm sorry.
 - Ah, you... Hey!

941
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,730
I'm sorry.

942
01:01:27,730 --> 01:01:29,450
I'm sorry.

943
01:01:29,450 --> 01:01:33,160
What are you, the manager who should be taking care of his actor, doing?

944
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:37,090
When I arrived late at the end of the show, I couldn't get in.

945
01:01:37,090 --> 01:01:40,860
You just finish eating a dessert of cold noodles and then wait outside.

946
01:01:40,860 --> 01:01:45,900
You're too much. I worked really hard taking care of Yoon Seo,

947
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,700
but you can't have one glass of alcohol on such a great day like this?!

948
01:01:48,700 --> 01:01:51,480
- I also ate a dessert of cold noodles. 
 - Oh, that is ...

949
01:01:51,480 --> 01:01:55,750
And, Mr. CEO! Honestly, who took care of Oh Yoon Seo?

950
01:01:55,750 --> 01:01:59,230
You? No, no. It's me, Kwon Hyeok Joon.

951
01:01:59,230 --> 01:02:02,820
Whether it rained or snowed, I kept Yoon Seo in front of me.

952
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:07,130
When she smiled, I smiled. When she cried, I'm the one who caught her tears.

953
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:12,200
When she threw something away, I'm the one who took it to the trash for her! Me, Kwon Hyeok Joon!

954
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:15,000
Yes. Good job. Why did you take so much?

955
01:02:15,000 --> 01:02:18,940
Stop taking it. Stop taking it and lower your voice.

956
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:23,100
- Why? Are you displeased? 
 - No, no.

957
01:02:23,100 --> 01:02:25,080
- I asked if you feel displeased.
 - No, no.

958
01:02:25,080 --> 01:02:27,640
- One moment, come closer?
 - Why? Why? What is it this time?

959
01:02:27,640 --> 01:02:32,270
I asked if you FEEL DISPLEASED!

960
01:02:32,270 --> 01:02:35,790
No, I don't feel displeased. Hey, you worked hard, too.

961
01:02:35,790 --> 01:02:37,340
Thank you.

962
01:02:37,340 --> 01:02:41,370
You're dead when you sober up. You worked hard. Good work.

963
01:02:41,370 --> 01:02:43,390
Sleep. Just sleep.

964
01:02:44,650 --> 01:02:46,690
There are enemies all around me.

965
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:53,100
Mr. Lawyer.  You're coming tomorrow for the tenth-anniversary party, right?

966
01:02:53,100 --> 01:02:56,100
Then let's meet up for a little whlie tomorrow.

967
01:02:56,100 --> 01:02:58,640
I have something to tell you.

968
01:02:58,640 --> 01:03:01,010
It's still chilly when the wind blows.

969
01:03:01,010 --> 01:03:02,660
Isn't it nice to come outside because of that?

970
01:03:02,700 --> 01:03:03,700
Yes.

971
01:03:05,080 --> 01:03:07,550
But, didn't you say yesterday that you have something to tell me?

972
01:03:07,550 --> 01:03:10,060
Ah... Let's sit here for a minute and talk.

973
01:03:10,060 --> 01:03:12,030
Here?

974
01:03:14,680 --> 01:03:17,350
- One moment.
 - Okay.

975
01:03:19,750 --> 01:03:23,340
Drink this red ginsaeng first and then let's talk.

976
01:03:23,340 --> 01:03:28,280
Because a very tiring schedule is awaiting us today.

977
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:29,580
A tiring schedule?

978
01:03:29,580 --> 01:03:32,190
First, don't ask any questions or argue and just drink that.

979
01:03:32,190 --> 01:03:34,030
Okay.

980
01:03:37,770 --> 01:03:39,220
Good job.

981
01:03:39,220 --> 01:03:42,180
- How is it? Do you feel strengthened?
 - Yes.

982
01:03:42,180 --> 01:03:44,900
Alright, then. Hold me on your back and take off!

983
01:03:44,900 --> 01:03:46,170
What?

984
01:03:46,170 --> 01:03:49,270
I'm joking. It's a joke. Hold my hand and let's go!

985
01:03:49,270 --> 01:03:51,800
- Let's go.
 - Alright.

986
01:03:57,790 --> 01:03:59,370
Why are we here all of a sudden?

987
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:00,740
I have a lot of suits.

988
01:04:00,740 --> 01:04:03,530
That's for when you go to work.

989
01:04:03,530 --> 01:04:06,550
I'll coordinate a suit for going to a party.

990
01:04:06,550 --> 01:04:08,700
For a party?

991
01:04:08,700 --> 01:04:13,640
But the lawyer consultant is going, so isn't it too flashy?

992
01:04:13,640 --> 01:04:19,490
Ah... Today, you're not going as the lawyer consultant.

993
01:04:21,010 --> 01:04:24,620
You're going as my boyfriend.

994
01:04:25,750 --> 01:04:27,890
What?

995
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:31,700
I don't want to avoid it anymore.

996
01:04:31,700 --> 01:04:34,870
I want to speak about our relationship confidently and openly.

997
01:04:34,870 --> 01:04:36,960
That's alright, right?

998
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,560
Yes.

999
01:04:59,080 --> 01:05:04,450
â™«  Time, time is mystical  â™«

1000
01:05:04,450 --> 01:05:07,230
â™«  You regret after it has passed.  â™«

1001
01:05:07,230 --> 01:05:09,790
â™«  Oh, it's sad.  â™«

1002
01:05:09,790 --> 01:05:12,990
â™«  When a sweet dream wakes you up  â™«

1003
01:05:12,990 --> 01:05:15,410
â™«  even if its clear,  â™«

1004
01:05:15,410 --> 01:05:18,390
â™«  In a short instant  â™«

1005
01:05:18,390 --> 01:05:22,890
â™«  it soon fades and disappears again La La  â™«

1006
01:05:24,220 --> 01:05:27,070
â™«  Here you and me  â™«

1007
01:05:27,070 --> 01:05:29,760
â™«  now to this moment  â™«

1008
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:32,620
â™«  I'm trying to put and hold   â™«

1009
01:05:32,620 --> 01:05:34,760
â™«  In a place deep in my heart
  â™«

1010
01:05:34,760 --> 01:05:37,730
â™«  The touch of one hand comfortably over another  â™«

1011
01:05:37,730 --> 01:05:40,440
â™«  today's air also   â™«

1012
01:05:40,440 --> 01:05:42,860
Long time, no see!

1013
01:05:42,900 --> 01:05:46,000
â™«  Remember everything   â™«
 â™«  They are so precious   â™«

1014
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:48,200
This is our new lawyer.
â™«  So make it count  â™«

1015
01:05:48,230 --> 01:05:50,800
- His name is Kim Han Goo. 
 - Hello.

1016
01:05:50,800 --> 01:05:53,500
- To our love.
 - Cheers!

1017
01:05:53,500 --> 01:05:55,000
â™«  A light wind and blooming flowers  â™«

1018
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:59,900
â™«  one minute one second make it count  â™«

1019
01:05:59,910 --> 01:06:03,230
- She's coming!
 - Oh Yoon Seo!

1020
01:06:03,300 --> 01:06:06,700
â™«  I will gather every moment  â™«

1021
01:06:06,780 --> 01:06:10,190
â™«  and I will give them to you  â™«

1022
01:06:10,190 --> 01:06:12,540
â™«  La la la la  â™«

1023
01:06:12,540 --> 01:06:15,240
â™«  Time passes again  â™«

1024
01:06:15,260 --> 01:06:17,910
â™«  La la la la  â™«

1025
01:06:17,910 --> 01:06:20,300
â™«  I shall hope. Make it count  â™«

1026
01:06:20,300 --> 01:06:23,100
â™«  Lazing on a bench in the afternoon  â™«

1027
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:25,670
â™«  Lie down comfortably, pillowed on my lap  â™«

1028
01:06:25,700 --> 01:06:28,540
â™«  Because the time which is slack is sweet  â™«

1029
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:31,810
â™«  Because the gravity here is exactly twice as much  â™«

1030
01:06:31,810 --> 01:06:33,520
â™«  The day is brief  â™«

1031
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:37,530
â™«  Everyday the longing rises up again  â™«

1032
01:06:37,530 --> 01:06:42,420
 Everyone will recognize my feelings and my sincerity, right? 

1033
01:06:42,420 --> 01:06:46,060
 Those feelings will definitely touch everyone. 

1034
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,270
 Just like your sincerity touched me. 

1035
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:50,960
â™«  A light wind and blooming flowers  â™«

1037
01:06:55,710 --> 01:06:58,990
â™«  Then make me everlasting.  â™«

1038
01:06:58,990 --> 01:07:02,540
â™«  I will gather every moment  â™«

1044
01:07:17,210 --> 01:07:24,040
â™«  I must tell you again   â™«
