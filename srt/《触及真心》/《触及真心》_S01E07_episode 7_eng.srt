1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,900


2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:08,570
 Missing. She's Gone!
 Yoon Seo Oh 

3
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:16,180
 CALL 

4
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,200
 Touch Your Heart 

5
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:40,730
 Touch Your Heart 

6
00:00:57,940 --> 00:01:00,150
I'm becoming concerned.

7
00:01:01,210 --> 00:01:06,630
The same way that you worry about me and comfort me,

8
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,080
I also want to do the same for you now.

9
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,520
Those words...

10
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,760
Do they mean that I've become a bit more special to you than before?

11
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:27,970
Yes.

12
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:42,040
Yes, this is Kwon Jeong Rok.

13
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:44,110
Ah, yes, please speak.

14
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:48,410
I don't think you must announce that the verdict was in our favor. Yes.

15
00:01:59,530 --> 00:02:04,400
 Anyway, you worked hard going through that hard trial with me. 

16
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,700
 Rest well for tomorrow. 

17
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,030
Wait. What does he mean, for tomorrow?

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,870
Is tomorrow some special day or something?

19
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:26,230
Is he planning to confess?

20
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,420
Well, the mood was set up for him to confess earlier if the phone hadn't rung.

21
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,340
Ah, I don't know!

22
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:40,990
Ah, I don't know! He's going to confess tomorrow!

23
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:44,670
 Episode 7 

24
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:50,230
- Good morning!
 - Good morning.

25
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,870
- Good morning!
 - Oh, you're here?

26
00:02:51,870 --> 00:02:54,720
Ah, good morning!

27
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,810
Did something good happen to Yoon Seo?

28
00:02:56,810 --> 00:02:58,710
I'm not sure.

29
00:03:00,950 --> 00:03:04,680
Hm? Did he go somewhere?

30
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,580
Why flowers?

31
00:03:10,430 --> 00:03:13,670
Then did Mr. Lawyer...?

32
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:50,760
 The cold which I didn't think was going to take flight easily has left 

33
00:03:50,800 --> 00:03:53,930
 and  the warm spring is already on its way. 

34
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:57,810
Oh, our lawyer is waxing so lyrical!

35
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:02,280
 It's a small and insignificant gift, 

36
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,220
 but I prepared it with a huge heart, so I would be thankful if you accepted it happily. 

37
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,910
What do you mean, it's insignificant? It's so precious!

38
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:16,780
 It must have been difficult, but because you didn't  give up to the end, 

39
00:04:16,780 --> 00:04:20,950
 you saved one woman from unfairly becoming a sacrificial lamb... 

40
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:22,860
A sacrificial lamb?

41
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,250
 Thank you for taking on Im Yoon Hui's case. 

42
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,420
 Lee Young Ok from the Women's Group 

43
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,950
Ah, you're here?

44
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:39,260
Ah. This...

45
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:43,430
Ah, the flowers? Yes, the Women's Group sent it. But I don't really like flowers,

46
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:46,240
so I brought them out here for you to get rid of them.

47
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:49,800
Ah, I see.

48
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:55,000
The CEO said everyone needs to come to a meeting for a case briefing.

49
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,900
Alright.

50
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:59,410
Let's get ready and go.

51
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:09,990
Alright, before we do the briefing,

52
00:05:09,990 --> 00:05:12,690
to our law firm's hope and treasure

53
00:05:12,690 --> 00:05:16,270
who solved Im Yoon Hui's case cleanly,

54
00:05:16,270 --> 00:05:19,510
let's give our Lawyer Kwon a round of applause.

55
00:05:21,190 --> 00:05:23,520
Please stop. Thank you.

56
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,850
Look at him being embarrassed.

57
00:05:25,850 --> 00:05:28,340
Isn't this another of our Lawyer Kwon's charms?

58
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:31,010
Alright, let's officially get started.

59
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:35,260
You know  our law firm has accepted the Sangji-dong case?

60
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:39,850
As it is very important, let's hear the briefing from Lawyer Kwon and then give our opinions.

61
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,390
Alright.

62
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:48,550
I'll show the picture of the victim before I begin the briefing.

63
00:05:51,260 --> 00:05:55,770
What is this? But why is it a picture of the Universe's Goddess Yeon Seo?

64
00:05:55,770 --> 00:05:58,580
What crime exactly did she commit?

65
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:01,120
What crime did she commit?

66
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:05,890
That is none other than... the crime of larceny by stealing my heart.

67
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,080
Specifically, the crime of assault by her beauty which blinded me.

68
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,050
And the crime of attempted murder because if I don't see her every day, my heart aches and I can' t live.

69
00:06:15,050 --> 00:06:18,390
I'm going to make sure Oh Jin Sim gets a life sentence

70
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:22,270
and make her unable to leave my side for the rest of her life.

71
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:26,630
Oh Jin Sim, accept my heart for you!

72
00:06:26,670 --> 00:06:30,470
Take me. Please arrest me right now! Please!

73
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:32,930
Yoon Seo.

74
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:35,380
What are you doing right now?

75
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,840
What are you doing?

76
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,290
 Sangji-dong Murder Case 

77
00:06:49,230 --> 00:06:54,440
That person. That person will definitely be captured like this. Definitely.

78
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:59,560
Because Lawyer Kwon will definitely make sure it happens.

79
00:07:03,980 --> 00:07:06,450
Yoon Seo, you're really extraordinary.

80
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:10,150
Isn't this our Yoon Seo's charm? Her visuals are perfect,

81
00:07:10,150 --> 00:07:12,970
but her actions are really odd and vivid.

82
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,070
Thank you for viewing me in a good light.

83
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:19,570
Ah, he's a bad guy.

84
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:23,640
I shall begin the briefing.

85
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:33,320
I'm seriously crazy. What's wrong with me, seriously?

86
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,640
Get a hold of yourself, Oh Yoon Seo.

87
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:43,910
I'm telling you to wait elegantly, in a way that befits an actress.

88
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,250
Elegantly.

89
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,470
Oh? It's six o'clock.

90
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,090
Omo? Why is he... Flying toward me is

91
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,780
the small confession in my everyday life?

92
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:31,170
What the heck? He was wiping away dust?

93
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:42,380
I haven't been able to pay attention lately due to being busy, but it's seriously dirty in there.

94
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:45,400
I'll file a claim with the cleaning company.

95
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:49,170
I'll take care of that, so don't worry about it.

96
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,430
Then.

97
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:52,540
Wait a second!

98
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:58,040
Is that all? Well,

99
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,740
do you have nothing to tell me?

100
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:02,990
- What?
 - Forget it.

101
00:09:02,990 --> 00:09:05,670
It's nothing.

102
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:13,690
I'll leave first.

103
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:32,410
Wait... Why...

104
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:43,280
I looked pretty for nothing.

105
00:09:45,290 --> 00:09:49,700
You're doing that again. There you go again! You said you were going to wait elegantly.

106
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:53,670
Alright. Go back to the elegant actress mode.

107
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:06,820
♫  One step at a time  ♫

108
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:10,250
I'm waiting elegantly.

109
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:13,550
♫  Too much for your mind   ♫

110
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,110
♫  I was only being kind  ♫

111
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:22,960
♫  Theres no need to analyze  ♫

112
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,210
Elegantly.

113
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,870
 Secretary Oh Jin Sim 

114
00:10:42,870 --> 00:10:44,240
Yes? Oh Jin Sim—

115
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:46,580
- I can't wait anymore.
 - What?

116
00:10:46,580 --> 00:10:51,570
I said that I can't wait anymore. I don't want to be aloof!

117
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,160
I just want to live my life saying everything that I want to say!

118
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:02,800
I think that I'm going to go crazy wanting a confession from you, Mr. Lawyer!

119
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,070
Wh-What do you—

120
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:07,610
Do you not want to confess to me? Okay, okay.

121
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:11,790
Then I'll do it first. Yeah.

122
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,250
Since I'm about to do it...

123
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,970
Wait a second, hold on.

124
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:29,920
I like you, Mr. Lawyer.

125
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:36,610
You remember that, don't you?

126
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,290
Back then, I had something I wanted to say.

127
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:50,020
That thing that I told you I can't say now, but I wanted to say sometime.

128
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:56,000
Really, the thing is—

129
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,560
 I love you. 

130
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,320
The thing is

131
00:12:02,170 --> 00:12:07,950
Within my heart, ... Lawyer,  so ...

132
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:13,720
there is a clear and immaculate super-pure area in my heart.

133
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:20,420
Shooong ... What I'm saying is that you slid into my heart.

134
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:31,900
So yesterday, when you told me that I was special,

135
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:35,510
I was so happy.

136
00:12:36,130 --> 00:12:41,120
Because of that, all day I waited for the next day to come.

137
00:12:42,910 --> 00:12:46,580
But how could you make me so laughable?

138
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:48,990
Me, Oh Yoon Seo!

139
00:12:49,930 --> 00:12:51,800
Mr. Lawyer, you're really bad!

140
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:53,810
Oh Jin Sim.

141
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,850
O-Oh Jin Sim?

142
00:13:13,230 --> 00:13:14,900
What is it?

143
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,570
What's wrong?  Did something happen?

144
00:13:17,570 --> 00:13:20,920
Is your new case troublesome?

145
00:13:23,020 --> 00:13:24,870
Never mind.

146
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:29,480
Why is he like that?

147
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,390
I'll tell you just the facts.  You listen closely and decide for yourself.

148
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:35,890
A man has started to have feelings for a woman.

149
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:39,870
So he said to the woman, "You have become special to me."

150
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:42,470
That's what he said.

151
00:13:42,470 --> 00:13:45,570
The man thought it was enough to say only that much.

152
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:49,080
He was thinking that since we just started to like each other, we can get to know each other slowly.

153
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,140
But that wasn't the case for the woman.

154
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:57,310
She was waiting for what came next, but the man didn't take any actions, so she's really angry.

155
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:00,460
Is the man very wrong?

156
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:05,850
Are you sure this is about a case, and not about you?

157
00:14:05,850 --> 00:14:08,600
What do you mean, it's about me?  I'm talking about my client!

158
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:10,510
That's funny.

159
00:14:10,510 --> 00:14:14,760
It's not like you started a relationship counseling center.

160
00:14:16,230 --> 00:14:19,120
Never mind.  Let's stop talking about it.

161
00:14:19,900 --> 00:14:24,310
The man is not wrong.  Since what he said is not wrong either.

162
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:32,110
- Right?
 - Still, I want to take that woman's side.

163
00:14:32,730 --> 00:14:36,720
Who does romance so logically and who dates after knowing everything like that?

164
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:38,870
You get to know each other while you date.

165
00:14:38,870 --> 00:14:41,580
The man is already tied up. "You're special to me." Boom.

166
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,230
He already said something so decisive.

167
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:47,420
If he cuts it off right there, who would like that?

168
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:52,610
You still don't understand?

169
00:14:52,610 --> 00:14:54,890
Listen up, you're arguing a case in court.

170
00:14:54,890 --> 00:14:59,320
Your Honor, when you look at all the circumstantial evidence thus far,

171
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,990
the defendant's actions lacked intention.

172
00:15:01,990 --> 00:15:06,060
Also, they have a solid alibi at the time of the crime.  Therefore, I—

173
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,010
- What happens if it stops there?
 - That's unsatisfactory.

174
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:15,460
Right?  All the important points were made but there is no conclusion, so it's not satisfying.

175
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:20,850
That's exactly what you— No, I mean, your client did.

176
00:15:20,850 --> 00:15:25,110
That's what he did to that woman.  Okay?

177
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:42,310
 Oh Jin Sim, I'm sorry. 

178
00:15:42,310 --> 00:15:45,910
 I thought we were just at the stage of getting to know each other. 

179
00:15:52,790 --> 00:15:58,300
 Oh Jin Sim, I did not think things through.  Forgive me and date me— 

180
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:06,820
 Oh Jin Sim, let's meet tomorrow and talk. 

181
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,690
What is it now?

182
00:16:17,690 --> 00:16:22,170
Well, I suddenly thought of something to tell your client.

183
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:27,870
Confess as soon as possible. Whether flowers or something small and sparkly,

184
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:31,220
tell him to prepare whatever she likes.

185
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:35,510
- What?
 - Going to confess your feelings empty handed

186
00:16:35,510 --> 00:16:38,510
Is like going to court without evidence.

187
00:16:38,510 --> 00:16:41,860
I've never met your client before, but for some reason,

188
00:16:41,860 --> 00:16:46,120
I feel like he has no experience at relationships, so I'm offering advice.

189
00:16:47,060 --> 00:16:49,400
- Then work hard.
 - Okay.

190
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:51,950
I'll tell him that.

191
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,830
 Oh Jin Sim, let's talk when we meet tomorrow. 

192
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,460
 Heights Mansion 

193
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:39,820
What's this?

194
00:17:41,340 --> 00:17:44,110
Did I sleep here?

195
00:17:46,990 --> 00:17:49,400
 Oh Jin Sim, let's talk when we meet tomorrow. 

196
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:54,820
What does he mean, let's talk when we meet?

197
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,600
Did I make any mistakes?

198
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,720
 I feel like I'm going to go crazy because I want you to confess your feelings! 

199
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,660
 Look here. There is a clear and  immaculate super-pure area ... 

200
00:18:06,270 --> 00:18:08,080
 I like you, Mr. Lawyer. 

201
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,100
 I was so happy. 

202
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:12,640
 Did you faint because you're so happy? 

203
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:15,800
 Mr. Lawyer, you're really bad! 

204
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,740
 I love you. 

205
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:22,960
What does he want to talk about when we meet?

206
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,100
A woman like you is the worst?

207
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,910
Let's not meet again?

208
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:35,090
Yoon Seo, are you still sleeping?

209
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:39,380
What, you're awake?

210
00:18:41,110 --> 00:18:44,590
Oppa, can you buy me a white envelope?

211
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:48,530
A white envelope?  Why, do you need to give congratulatory money?

212
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:51,930
No, I don't need to give money.

213
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:54,190
- Then what are you going to put in it?
 - A letter of resignation.

214
00:18:54,190 --> 00:18:55,180
A letter of resignation?

215
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:58,230
I'm not working at the law firm anymore.

216
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:02,580
No, I can't go there.

217
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:07,790
Hello.

218
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:09,880
- You're here?
 - You're here?

219
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,280
Hey, Lawyer Kwon, it's a good thing that you're here right now.

220
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:21,370
My cousin just called me and said that Yoon Seo is taking the day off today.

221
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:24,150
- Excuse me?
 - Why?  Is Yoon Seo sick?

222
00:19:24,150 --> 00:19:25,550
I don't think she's sick.

223
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:29,850
I said that I would go visit her with flowers and porridge.

224
00:19:29,850 --> 00:19:32,620
She was being evasive and said

225
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:35,200
that she's not sick, something else came up. There must be some other reason.

226
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,770
Maybe she just wanted to take a day off?

227
00:19:37,770 --> 00:19:41,480
Probably not.  She doesn't seem like such an irresponsible person.

228
00:19:41,480 --> 00:19:45,910
What's up with you, Secretary Yang?  You're even taking Yoon Seo's side.

229
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:49,530
I acknowledge what's true.  Yoon Seo has been working hard all this time.

230
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:54,100
She's right.  At first, I was prejudiced against her because she's a celebrity.

231
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:56,190
With the Yoo Ra case last time,

232
00:19:56,190 --> 00:19:59,950
and this time during Im Yoon Hui's trial, she seemed like a really great person.

233
00:19:59,950 --> 00:20:03,800
Isn't it as if Yeon Seo is standing in a field in autumn,

234
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:08,070
like a scarecrow, a mute and earnest being?

235
00:20:08,860 --> 00:20:11,520
A scarecrow is a bit much.

236
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,510
But just what could it be?

237
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:19,770
Lawyer Kwon, what's wrong with your expression?

238
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,580
Did something happen between you and Yoon Seo?

239
00:20:21,580 --> 00:20:23,770
No, nothing happened.

240
00:20:23,770 --> 00:20:29,070
What do you mean, nothing happened?  Your expression looks like something happened for sure.

241
00:20:29,070 --> 00:20:32,290
By chance, is Yoon Seo doing this because having a hard time because you're giving her too much work?

242
00:20:32,290 --> 00:20:34,400
No, that's not it.

243
00:20:34,400 --> 00:20:38,980
It's not?  If it's not a work issue, then is it a love issue?

244
00:20:38,980 --> 00:20:43,260
Are we going to find out that they had some kind of love connection?

245
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:46,800
What the heck.  I'm just joking but he doesn't even laugh.

246
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:50,840
His skills are exceptional, but his sense of humor is terrible.

247
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,070
It's the worst.

248
00:21:10,850 --> 00:21:14,990
 The customer cannot answer the call right now. 

249
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:35,720
 Resumé 

250
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:45,510
 Whether it's flowers and something small and sparkly, 

251
00:21:45,510 --> 00:21:48,890
 Tell him to prepare whatever that woman likes. 

252
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,110
 Things Oh Jin Sim likes 

253
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,160
 Things Oh Yoon Seo Likes 

254
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:09,490
Ribeye steak?

255
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:13,000
It's not even a holiday.

256
00:22:20,690 --> 00:22:24,730
 Time to have a frank talk with a star at the star's regular tavern. 

257
00:22:24,730 --> 00:22:27,860
  Let's have today's Entertainer Talk with today's guest
 (Entertainer Talk Today's Main Character?) 

258
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:29,600
 Everyone, don't be surprised. It's the universe's goddess, 

259
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,900
 Oh Yoon Seo! Hello!  
 (My Goddess, Your Goddess, the Universe's Goddess Oh Yeon Seo) 

260
00:22:32,970 --> 00:22:35,800
 Hello!  
 (My Goddess, Your Goddess, the Universe's Goddess Oh Yeon Seo) 

261
00:22:35,810 --> 00:22:37,830
 Yes.  It's an honor to see you again. 

262
00:22:37,830 --> 00:22:41,450
 But it's unexpected. When it comes to you, 

263
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:44,590
 it seems like you'd like some high-class restaurant. Yet you like chicken feet restaurants. 

264
00:22:44,590 --> 00:22:48,940
 Ah, I really like the chicken feet at this restaurant. 
(It is the Universe's Goddess' chicken feet restaurant?) 

265
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,080
 It's close to my house, so sometimes I take it to-go. 

266
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:55,030
 It's especially good on days when I'm feeling down.
(Chicken feet on a day you're down.) 

267
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:57,440
- Chicken feet. Chicken feet...
  - Oh Yoon Seo, 

268
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:59,810
 what type of man do you like?
 (Universe's Goddess Oh Yoon Seo's type of man) 

269
00:22:59,810 --> 00:23:04,500
 It seems like you'd like someone extremely skilled and handsome. 

270
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:09,120
 Ah... That's not true. I don't look at looks. 

271
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:12,390
 I, um, 

272
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:15,080
 would like it if he was a person who moved my heart. 

273
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:18,150
 For example, writing me handwritten letters.
 (~ Moving ~ Moving Handwritten Letters) 

274
00:23:18,150 --> 00:23:19,310
Handwritten letters?

275
00:23:19,310 --> 00:23:21,750
 If he confessed to me through a handwritten letter, I think I would love it. 

276
00:23:21,750 --> 00:23:23,740
Wait, how could you...?

277
00:23:23,740 --> 00:23:26,690
 Isn't it so romantic? 

278
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:35,580
You're here?

279
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:41,320
Ah, I'm really going to go crazy. Why is she saying that she won't go to work? What's her reason?

280
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:44,270
I'm not sure. She won't tell me a word.

281
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:47,470
She locked herself in her room and won't come out. What should we do?

282
00:23:47,470 --> 00:23:50,990
Writer Lee Se Jin gave her a chance by having her go to a law firm for three months.

283
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:54,440
But with the atmosphere as it is now, it seems like Yoon Seo won't ever be able to make a comeback.

284
00:23:54,440 --> 00:23:59,120
But it's also really troublesome to search for another law firm that will keep her secret now.

285
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:02,260
Don't worry. I'm here.

286
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:05,060
I'll get Yoon Seo to go back to the law firm no matter what it takes.

287
00:24:05,060 --> 00:24:07,840
I'm not sure. Her stubborness is really—

288
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:11,240
Hey, I'm Yeon Joon Seok. I'm the CEO of the Yeongyu Entertainment, Yeon Joon Seok.

289
00:24:11,240 --> 00:24:13,420
Have you seen anyone able to handle Yoon Seo as well as I can?

290
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,720
No.

291
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,560
Just believe in me.

292
00:24:17,270 --> 00:24:20,350
- It's this way.
 - Ah, this way?

293
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:28,920
Yoon Seo.

294
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,450
Yoon Seo, the CEO is here.

295
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:41,230
I heard. You said that you won't go to the law firm from now on.

296
00:24:41,230 --> 00:24:45,820
Yes. I'm not going now.

297
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:49,660
No... I can't go.

298
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:53,070
Alright. Good thinking.

299
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,990
Don't go.

300
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,320
- What?
 - CEO!

301
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,730
Why are you so surprised! It's right for her not to go if she doesn't want to.

302
00:25:00,730 --> 00:25:05,580
Hey, no matter how much she is doing this for the sake of realistic acting, do you think it's easy

303
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:09,620
for my goddess, your goddess, and the Universe's Goddess to make it through three months of working at a law firm?

304
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:13,630
To be honest, I haven't been able to stretch out and sleep comfortably since I sent you there, not once.

305
00:25:13,630 --> 00:25:16,250
I was thinking of how hard it must be for you, and how troubling it must be.

306
00:25:16,250 --> 00:25:20,340
So, don't go there. Just quit.

307
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:23,890
But if she quits now, she won't be able to take on the lawyer role in Writer Lee Se Jin's drama.

308
00:25:23,890 --> 00:25:25,710
Hey, is that really that important?

309
00:25:25,710 --> 00:25:29,120
She can just make up her mind and take on an unemployed woman's role later.

310
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:32,690
Anyway, if she quits working at the law firm and can't make a comeback through Writer Lee Se Jin's drama,

311
00:25:32,690 --> 00:25:37,180
she'll just get a good long rest inside her house for a few years. Then she would be able to act out

312
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:42,400
a calm and bored unemployed woman's role so realistically. Her boredom would just drip from her face.

313
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:44,440
Isn't that right, Yoon Seo?

314
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:49,320
- CEO.
 - Yeah. Why?

315
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:51,400
Do you want to go back to the law firm?

316
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:56,760
No, it's just, I want to send you out of here right now, CEO.

317
00:25:57,340 --> 00:26:00,830
I'm already annoyed to death anyway,

318
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:05,020
so how dare you threaten me? Do you think I'm that clueless?!

319
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:11,440
Our Yoon Seo has gotten way better at catching onto things now that she's lived out in society for a few days!

320
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:15,080
I got way better! Way better! I got so much better!

321
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:17,480
Ah, seriously!

322
00:26:19,000 --> 00:26:20,050
Yoon Seo, where are you going?

323
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:23,080
I'm going to pull an all nighter. An ALL NIGHTER!

324
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:25,080
Let's go together. Oppa will give you a ride.

325
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:30,080
Hey, don't you know Oh Yoon Seo? When she gets that stubborn, there's no solution.

326
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:32,340
Let's just stay and wait here.

327
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:35,410
Hey, bring me some beer out of the fridge. Ah!

328
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:47,890
A teddy bear.

329
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:03,290
Since she likes pink,

330
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,960
I'll go with pink.

331
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:09,030
 Oh Jin Sim, look here. 

332
00:27:09,030 --> 00:27:11,880
  Kwon Jeong Rok, himself, on February 06, 2019  

333
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:15,310
  at Seoul Seocho District Always Law Firm's secretary office  

334
00:27:15,310 --> 00:27:18,770
  met the other side, Oh Jin Sim, for the first time.  

335
00:27:24,070 --> 00:27:28,480
  After many work interactions and meals, 

336
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:34,270
  I realized that Oh Jin Sim's heart is not deceitful nor fake, but instead is truthful and real.  

337
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:37,440
  Thus, Kwon Jeong Rok would like to formally request to Oh Jin Sim,  

338
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:42,950
  to officially date and would like to ask that she give her consent.  

339
00:27:50,500 --> 00:27:54,060
At this rate, I'll also be writing 'Dear Honorable Judge'.

340
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,130
  Husband Murder Case, Witness and Suspect Switche at the Trial /i&gt; 

341
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,120
 Suspicions of Coercive Interrogation by the Prosecution Surface 

342
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:52,350
Ms. Prosecutor, let's go eat.

343
00:28:52,350 --> 00:28:54,950
I'm not hungry.

344
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:59,820
Alright. Then we'll go eat.

345
00:28:59,820 --> 00:29:01,390
Okay.

346
00:29:28,410 --> 00:29:30,640
- Eat a lot.
 - Okay.

347
00:29:30,700 --> 00:29:33,600
- Are you just now eating? 
 - Yes.

348
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:38,050
But did Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum go somewhere? Did she have an afternoon appointment?

349
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:41,060
No. She's in her office. She said she doesn't have an appetite.

350
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:44,080
Maybe it's because she's stressed out from Im Yoon Hui's case these days,

351
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:46,660
but she continues not to eat much.

352
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,840
Really?

353
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,090
Let's have a change of scenery.

354
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:13,620
Welcome!

355
00:30:15,860 --> 00:30:18,100
One order of chicken feet, please.

356
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,120
It's been a long time since you came by.

357
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,570
Shh!

358
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:28,220
One order of chicken feet.

359
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:32,400
- Make them spicy. Spicy.
 - Make them really spicy! One of our regulars came.

360
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,670
Oh Jin Sim?

361
00:30:34,670 --> 00:30:36,900
It's not Oh Jin Sim.

362
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,520
Hey, wait—

363
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,550
Oh Jin Sim!

364
00:30:49,110 --> 00:30:51,740
Oh Jin Sim, let's talk!

365
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:55,120
Oh Jin Sim!

366
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:07,630
Wait, what in the world are you doing?

367
00:31:07,630 --> 00:31:09,160
That's...

368
00:31:10,690 --> 00:31:13,370
Let's talk.

369
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,840
What?

370
00:31:20,340 --> 00:31:24,160
Why in the world did you run away?

371
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:28,040
And why didn't you come to the law firm?

372
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:31,960
It's because it was embarrassing to see you.

373
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:33,930
What do you mean, embarrassing?

374
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:40,300
Would I not be embarrassed? I got drunk and did a horrible confession to you.

375
00:31:42,510 --> 00:31:46,220
I'm the one who really gave a horrible confession.

376
00:31:46,220 --> 00:31:47,610
What?

377
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:54,150
Because I expressed my feelings so ambiguously, I made you wait for me.

378
00:31:54,150 --> 00:31:59,100
And I even made you feel embarrassed, so my confession was the worst.

379
00:32:00,100 --> 00:32:02,690
Mr. Lawyer...

380
00:32:02,690 --> 00:32:08,230
So, it's late, but I want to give you a proper confession even now.

381
00:32:19,890 --> 00:32:21,950
What is this?

382
00:32:21,950 --> 00:32:25,590
I didn't know what you liked, so I looked it up.

383
00:32:25,590 --> 00:32:28,930
There was a video of an interview at your favorite chicken feet restaurant.

384
00:32:28,930 --> 00:32:34,500
You said that you liked that restaurant's chicken feet and that you wanted to have a handwritten letter.

385
00:32:35,660 --> 00:32:38,090
Then this is...

386
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:42,830
I couldn't buy you the chicken feet, but please at least accept this.

387
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:47,220
Ah! Are you planning to read that in front of me right now?

388
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:49,560
Yes! Of course, I'm about to die from the curiosity!

389
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,350
But, still...

390
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:56,970
Then I'll go to the car first and wait for you there.

391
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:02,080
 Let's date. 

392
00:33:14,300 --> 00:33:16,730
I want to!   I totally want to!

393
00:33:16,730 --> 00:33:19,820
Let's date! 
♫  One one one my one  ♫

394
00:33:19,820 --> 00:33:24,260
♫  The only one one one you are  ♫

395
00:33:24,260 --> 00:33:26,060
♫  If this is love love  ♫

396
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,880
Thank you for accepting my feelings. 
♫  Love love is love  ♫

397
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:31,480
Thank you for telling me, even if it's late.

398
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:36,610
♫  What should I do?  What if this is the love?  ♫

399
00:33:43,950 --> 00:33:45,080
It's going to wear out.

400
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:49,580
I'm going to look at it again and again until it wears out.

401
00:33:53,370 --> 00:33:58,830
Wait just a moment.  I'm going to go change my clothes.

402
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:01,930
Let's go to the law firm together.

403
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:04,920
- You should just rest today.
 - Why?

404
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,560
You're going to be extremely busy today if you're going to take care of all the cases

405
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:10,330
that were put aside because of the Im Yoon Hui case.

406
00:34:10,330 --> 00:34:12,750
If I'm not there, it'll be harder for you.

407
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:17,160
You knew that and yet you didn't come to work today?

408
00:34:19,330 --> 00:34:23,330
I appreciate the thought, but since you already took the day off, you should just rest today.

409
00:34:23,330 --> 00:34:27,090
- Anyway, I won't be at the law firm this afternoon. 
 - Why?

410
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:32,630
I have to go to court, go to the Public Prosecution Office, and then meet with a client.

411
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:36,700
I should be done with everything around seven.

412
00:34:36,700 --> 00:34:39,140
What do you think?

413
00:34:39,140 --> 00:34:40,530
Excuse me?

414
00:34:41,430 --> 00:34:43,650
We should go on a date.

415
00:34:43,650 --> 00:34:46,910
Today is our "day one."

416
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:51,020
Okay.

417
00:34:51,020 --> 00:34:53,040
Why are you laughing?

418
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,070
It's just...

419
00:34:55,070 --> 00:34:59,500
The words "date" and "day one"

420
00:34:59,500 --> 00:35:02,590
are so beautiful!

421
00:35:04,870 --> 00:35:09,470
Then, I'll come to pick you up around seven.

422
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,880
Then.

423
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:14,370
I'll see you later.

424
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:32,550
Im Yoon Hui, who was the suspect in court, became a victim.

425
00:35:32,550 --> 00:35:36,100
There are many requests to reveal whether there was any coercive interrogation during the investigation.

426
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:38,150
What are you going to do?

427
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:40,660
There was no coercive interrogation.

428
00:35:40,660 --> 00:35:44,690
Does it even make sense that you just believed the victim's confession and investigated in the first place?!

429
00:35:45,580 --> 00:35:48,540
- I'm sorry.
 - Get out.

430
00:35:52,150 --> 00:35:55,720
I should have let Prosecutor Im take it on in the first place.

431
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,300
Man.

432
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:24,460
I heard the news. I heard that the victim changed in the first hearing.

433
00:36:24,460 --> 00:36:27,190
That was like an episode from a drama with plot reversals.

434
00:36:27,190 --> 00:36:30,260
- Stop it.
 - In any case,

435
00:36:30,260 --> 00:36:34,720
it's not that the results of the trial had a sudden reversal. It's you that's a lump of reversals.

436
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:40,330
You acted up by looking down on your senior, so I thought you were amazingly skilled or something.

437
00:36:41,140 --> 00:36:44,960
Ah, you're so sloppy.

438
00:36:46,630 --> 00:36:48,130
Hey.

439
00:36:48,130 --> 00:36:51,050
What were you planning to do by only going after the innocent Im Yoon Hui?

440
00:36:51,050 --> 00:36:52,700
Innocent, you said?

441
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:58,080
Even though Im Yoon Hui didn't commit the murder herself, she's still an accomplice and an accessory to the crime,

442
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,810
because she actively erased traces of Park Myeong Soo.

443
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:08,750
Even after making the prosecution look so bad, you're still talking back.

444
00:37:12,720 --> 00:37:16,490
If it concerns the prosecutor's investigation, I think I better personally attend the meeting.

445
00:37:16,490 --> 00:37:21,360
Yes, yes. Regarding the schedule, I will discuss it with the prosecution and will contact you again.

446
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,580
Yes.

447
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:27,390
Yeo Reum.

448
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,520
Oh.

449
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:36,530
Are you okay? You really don't look good.

450
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:43,030
How did you find out that Park Soo Myeong was at the scene of the crime?

451
00:37:47,210 --> 00:37:51,960
Why didn't I realize what you caught on to?

452
00:37:54,990 --> 00:37:59,770
I know that it's not something to blame you for. Let's talk another time.

453
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,340
Yeo Reum!

454
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,930
 Korea Hospital 

455
00:38:09,930 --> 00:38:13,420
It seems that she's had a sudden increase in stress that caused gastritis, and she is also ill due to overwork and fatigue.

456
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:16,740
There won't be any major problems as long as we reduce her fever, so don't worry too greatly.

457
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:35,360
  Kwon Jeong Rok   
 Please give me the materials.

458
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:37,260
Also, when did you say they were going in?

459
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:39,450
The option is for tomorrow.  Here the are.

460
00:38:39,450 --> 00:38:43,100
 Your call can not be connected. You will be connected to voicemail— 

461
00:38:59,680 --> 00:39:01,770
 Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok 

462
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:05,430
Yes, Mr. Lawyer. Are you here?

463
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:09,230
What should I do? I don't think I'll be able to meet with you today.

464
00:39:09,230 --> 00:39:11,490
Ah. Why?

465
00:39:13,470 --> 00:39:17,400
Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum fainted, so I brought her to the ER.

466
00:39:17,400 --> 00:39:19,390
No, why? How?

467
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:22,520
They said that she has stomach cramps and that she's sick due to fatigue.

468
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:26,220
I've tried to get in touch with a friend for now, but even if he comes,

469
00:39:26,220 --> 00:39:30,210
I think that I'll have to go meet with the client that I had an appointment with today.

470
00:39:30,210 --> 00:39:33,710
I think that I won't be able to meet with you today, either way.

471
00:39:33,710 --> 00:39:36,610
Alright. Well, you can't help that.

472
00:39:36,610 --> 00:39:39,920
I understand. Yes.

473
00:39:56,130 --> 00:40:00,300
- What happened?
 - I heard that you met with Jeong Rok and then fainted.

474
00:40:00,300 --> 00:40:02,520
- Do you not remember?
 - Ah.

475
00:40:14,130 --> 00:40:18,290
But why are you here?

476
00:40:18,290 --> 00:40:20,910
You're finished with the IV fluid.

477
00:40:20,910 --> 00:40:22,770
They said that you could go home when you woke up.

478
00:40:22,770 --> 00:40:26,530
- I asked you why you're here.
 - Is that important?

479
00:40:26,530 --> 00:40:29,020
To ask you the same, why are  you  here?

480
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,430
How can you live when you're this sensitive?

481
00:40:43,430 --> 00:40:47,130
You haven't been doing trials for just a day or two. There are times when you'll win and times when you'll lose.

482
00:40:47,130 --> 00:40:50,480
If you keep dwelling on each and every one like that, how will you live?

483
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:54,800
What should I do now that I look like this?

484
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,920
I really hate it.

485
00:41:03,340 --> 00:41:08,890
I really hate how I lost at the trial and was ruined so easily

486
00:41:12,110 --> 00:41:15,460
and showing you myself in this state...

487
00:41:15,460 --> 00:41:17,570
I really hate it.

488
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:20,770
I hate it, too.

489
00:41:22,660 --> 00:41:25,170
I hate that my relationship with you has come to this.

490
00:41:28,840 --> 00:41:30,930
In the past,

491
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:34,430
you were honest only in front of me.

492
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:38,010
You smiled when you wanted to smile

493
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:41,500
and cried when you wanted to cry.

494
00:42:26,510 --> 00:42:29,420
Is he still busy?

495
00:42:29,420 --> 00:42:32,240
How can he not call once?

496
00:42:34,460 --> 00:42:36,650
He called! It's him!

497
00:42:39,560 --> 00:42:40,930
Yes, Mr. Lawyer.

498
00:42:40,930 --> 00:42:43,700
Possibly... Did I wake you from your sleep?

499
00:42:43,700 --> 00:42:47,000
No. Are you just now going home?

500
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,870
Yes. The discussion with my client went on for a long time.

501
00:42:49,870 --> 00:42:54,680
If it's this late, you must have already eaten dinner. Would you have at least a cup of tea with me?

502
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,560
Tea?

503
00:42:59,490 --> 00:43:03,490
No. You must have been tired doing this and that today,

504
00:43:03,490 --> 00:43:08,130
so go home and get some good rest. Let's see each other tomorrow.

505
00:43:09,090 --> 00:43:10,920
 But, Mr. Lawyer. 

506
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,240
Yes? Say it.

507
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:17,230
- I don't want today to be our day one.
 - What?

508
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:22,030
It's kind of off. What kind of day one goes by so futilely?

509
00:43:22,030 --> 00:43:27,020
So let's say that tomorrow is our day one.

510
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:32,660
Alright. Then let's say that tomorrow is our day one.

511
00:43:33,620 --> 00:43:36,470
I'm sorry that I couldn't keep my appointment with you today.

512
00:43:36,470 --> 00:43:42,200
It's nothing. Then get home safely. I'll see you tomorrow.

513
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,080
Yes.

514
00:43:52,410 --> 00:43:56,530
That's right. It's fine if we got to talk on the phone.

515
00:44:02,070 --> 00:44:04,110
 Let's date. 

516
00:44:05,820 --> 00:44:09,530
Alright, we are going to start to date properly tomorrow.

517
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,480
"Let's date."

518
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:18,790
Pardon? You're telling me to move to Lawyer Choi's office?

519
00:44:18,790 --> 00:44:23,830
Well... Would it be possible for a few days?

520
00:44:23,830 --> 00:44:27,250
Actually, right at this time when the holidays end,

521
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:29,480
divorce cases spike sharply.

522
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,200
Shall I call it the peak season for divorce? So if you go to Lawyer Choi,

523
00:44:31,200 --> 00:44:35,700
he's flooded with divorce cases. And it just so happens that Secretary Yang

524
00:44:35,700 --> 00:44:42,500
is going out of her mind assisting Lawyer Dan who is handling the lawsuit against the drug company.

525
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,770
But... I... If I'm not there,

526
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:49,320
it will be difficult for Lawyer Kwon.

527
00:44:49,320 --> 00:44:54,740
Im Yoon Hui's case is over, so aren't there no urgent cases?

528
00:44:54,740 --> 00:44:59,850
Well, I don't have anything urgent. I'm okay with it.

529
00:44:59,850 --> 00:45:02,730
Thank you for understanding. Thank you.

530
00:45:02,730 --> 00:45:06,460
Since you're the ace, you can do well on your own, right?

531
00:45:07,740 --> 00:45:09,400
If you are done talking, I will be leaving.

532
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:11,210
Yes, thank you.

533
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,520
Then, I will, too.

534
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:21,470
Thank you all for understanding.

535
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:26,200
I have a lot of good fortune. Lots of good fortune.

536
00:45:31,510 --> 00:45:36,480
Hey, Joon Seok. I separated Yoon Seo and Lawyer Kwon like you requested.

537
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:39,840
Thank you, Hyung. I think that

538
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:43,960
the reason why Yoon Seo resisted to go to the law firm yesterday has something to do with that lawyer.

539
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:45,670
 I heard from her manager 

540
00:45:45,670 --> 00:45:47,860
that they have a lot of problems together.

541
00:45:47,860 --> 00:45:51,270
She even said that she'll destroy him and that she will go to hell.

542
00:45:51,270 --> 00:45:52,830
They're that bad off?

543
00:45:52,830 --> 00:45:57,900
Anyway, from now on, you should ... separate trash...

544
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:00,620
No, no. Just separate them.

545
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:01,890
Don't worry. Don't worry.

546
00:46:01,890 --> 00:46:06,310
If it's for Yoon Seo's happiness, in the future

547
00:46:06,310 --> 00:46:07,910
I can make it so that those two won't need to talk to each other.

548
00:46:07,910 --> 00:46:10,850
Honey, it's me.

549
00:46:11,710 --> 00:46:15,650
I wanted to know if you wanted me to come for a while during lunch.

550
00:46:17,120 --> 00:46:20,400
You're busy?

551
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,590
Alright, work hard.

552
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,020
- Lawyer Dan, did you get a boyfriend? 
 - Yes.

553
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:34,890
I did get one.

554
00:46:34,890 --> 00:46:37,800
But, why did you sigh?

555
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:39,570
That's because...

556
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,280
Forget it. You told me last time that the quick service crush would come true,

557
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,930
and so I believed you and confessed and got dumped big time. Do you not remember that?

558
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:53,010
I made up my mind then to not receive love consultation

559
00:46:53,010 --> 00:46:55,260
from you anymore.

560
00:46:55,260 --> 00:46:57,400
I'm sorry about that time.

561
00:46:57,400 --> 00:47:01,870
But, there are more couples that are doing well after listening to my advice.

562
00:47:01,870 --> 00:47:06,100
On the show, there is a couple that got married

563
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:09,270
after listening to my counseling.

564
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:11,220
Marriage?

565
00:47:11,220 --> 00:47:13,650
Marriage?

566
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,130
It's a secret, but my boyfriend is actually

567
00:47:16,130 --> 00:47:18,990
the owner of the cafe right in front at the corner.

568
00:47:18,990 --> 00:47:23,460
He looks handsomely chic like an Americano and his voice is soft like a latte.

569
00:47:23,460 --> 00:47:26,810
He said he noticed me since I was a regular at the cafe. When he confessed to me,

570
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:29,830
it was sweet like a caramel macchiato.

571
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:33,560
It's romantic.

572
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:35,940
Then, why did you sigh?

573
00:47:35,940 --> 00:47:39,910
The problem is that it seems like only I like him, so it upsets me.

574
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:43,010
I want to put everything aside and just see my boyfriend.

575
00:47:43,010 --> 00:47:47,360
I want to us to be together all the time, but it seems he doesn't want that.

576
00:47:47,360 --> 00:47:48,560
Is that right?

577
00:47:48,560 --> 00:47:51,810
We originally decided to have a date last night,

578
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:54,080
but suddenly he said the coffee beans arrived

579
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:57,570
and he needed to concentrate on roasting them, so he couldn't meet me.

580
00:47:57,570 --> 00:48:01,180
Just now, too. Just now, I asked if I could come for lunch,

581
00:48:01,180 --> 00:48:06,120
but he said that he was busy because he had to press the oranges.

582
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:08,990
I understand that he's busy.

583
00:48:08,990 --> 00:48:13,000
Maybe it's because it's my first time dating, but it seems like only I want to see him and be with him.

584
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:15,170
It's upsetting.

585
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:18,250
Me too.

586
00:48:19,390 --> 00:48:21,410
- Excuse me? 
 - What?

587
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:29,700
I... If I were in the same situation as you, I would also be upset.

588
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:32,650
Yoon Seo...

589
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:36,520
Maybe it's because you're an actress, but you're incredibly empathetic.

590
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,300
I thought that you also started to date, so a lot of things were upsetting you.

591
00:48:41,300 --> 00:48:44,350
What nonsense are you saying?

592
00:48:49,330 --> 00:48:52,400
Oh Jin Sim, about what I said yesterday—

593
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:03,650
 Sit here. 

594
00:49:11,460 --> 00:49:15,240
Yoon Seo, it is an honor that you volunteered to come here.

595
00:49:15,240 --> 00:49:20,550
Since my winning rate is high, clients accumulate up to the clouds.

596
00:49:22,130 --> 00:49:25,600
That's right, this is my schedule.

597
00:49:25,600 --> 00:49:28,910
Call the clients and arrange a consultation time.

598
00:49:28,910 --> 00:49:30,920
Yes, I understand.

599
00:49:30,920 --> 00:49:33,310
Wait a minute.

600
00:49:33,850 --> 00:49:37,540
Ms. Hwang Yeon Doo who is coming for consultation at 2 PM,

601
00:49:37,540 --> 00:49:39,930
it's not the Hwang Yeon Doo I know, right?

602
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:46,200
It might be the right person. Are you talking about your past rival Hwang Yeon Doo?

603
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:50,740
That's true. It's a secret that you are working here.

604
00:49:50,740 --> 00:49:54,660
Then, how about you leave when she comes?

605
00:49:54,660 --> 00:49:57,980
It can be solved that way.

606
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:03,150
Perhaps, is this Unni getting divorced?

607
00:50:03,150 --> 00:50:06,920
Seeing how she scheduled a consultation with me, it seems like it.

608
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:08,700
Why? Why is she divorcing?

609
00:50:08,700 --> 00:50:12,300
In the lawyer's legal code, Article 26, a lawyer or former lawyer

610
00:50:12,300 --> 00:50:17,600
may not disclose anything confidential learned in the course of representation.

611
00:50:19,700 --> 00:50:24,610
Anyway, that's kind of sad. I thought she was living a good life after getting married.

612
00:50:24,610 --> 00:50:27,930
Were you two close to each other?

613
00:50:27,930 --> 00:50:32,700
Close... Not even.

614
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:37,300
There wasn't any other enemy like her.

615
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,590
 Oh Yoon Seo! 

616
00:50:44,110 --> 00:50:47,700
 What is this? Why did you grow this much? 

617
00:50:47,700 --> 00:50:50,820
 - How tall are your heels? 
 - 7 cm. 

618
00:50:50,820 --> 00:50:53,450
 - Coordi!
- Yes? 

619
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,190
 Get me 10 cm heels. 

620
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:57,900
 No. Get me 20 cm heels! 

621
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,380
 Yes. 

622
00:51:02,320 --> 00:51:05,200
 - I love you. 
 - I love you. 

623
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:22,740
 Director. Please add more reflectors for me than for Yoon Seo. 

624
00:51:22,740 --> 00:51:24,060
 Twice. No. 

625
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:25,850
 Three times more. 

626
00:51:37,270 --> 00:51:39,820
She was like that.

627
00:51:39,820 --> 00:51:43,240
She  had  to do better than me. She  had  to get a better treatment than me.

628
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:46,380
From her debut, her marriage, right to the moment she retired,

629
00:51:46,380 --> 00:51:48,980
she bullied me like hell.

630
00:51:48,980 --> 00:51:52,010
I've suddenly lost all of my will to take on this case.

631
00:51:52,010 --> 00:51:54,760
Should I decline the case?

632
00:51:56,240 --> 00:52:00,330
I didn't mean it like that. This is official work.

633
00:52:00,330 --> 00:52:03,000
You are a professional.

634
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:08,110
Then, as if I didn't have a soul, I shall consult with her like a robot.

635
00:52:09,320 --> 00:52:14,110
You came for a consultation. Are you having a hard time?

636
00:52:17,900 --> 00:52:19,500
Actually, even in court,

637
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,000
I will represent her without soul, as if I'm Alpha Go.

638
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:23,730
Pay attention.

639
00:52:24,500 --> 00:52:32,500
Th-ere is no rea-son to find Hwa-ng Yeon Doo at fa-u-lt.

640
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,720
Oh my gosh, it's already 1:30 PM! I might run into her.

641
00:52:41,720 --> 00:52:45,400
That won't do. Hurry up and leave. I will call you when the consultation is over.

642
00:52:45,400 --> 00:52:48,440
- Yes, I ask of you. 
 - Yes.

643
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,130
-  I came to see a lawyer.  
 -  Do you have an appointment? 

644
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:53,480
Of course.

645
00:52:53,480 --> 00:52:56,220
 Always 

646
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:05,850
Wh-What are you doing right now?

647
00:53:05,850 --> 00:53:08,990
There's my sunbaenim from when I was acting.

648
00:53:08,990 --> 00:53:11,530
You know that I can't be caught working here.

649
00:53:11,530 --> 00:53:13,300
 Thank you. 

650
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:17,830
Then, I will lower the blinds.

651
00:53:17,830 --> 00:53:20,530
Go to my office.

652
00:53:22,570 --> 00:53:24,720
No, that woman has such a strong personality.

653
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:27,390
It's better if I leave outside.

654
00:53:30,730 --> 00:53:34,410
Hello, I am Hwang Yeon Doo.

655
00:53:34,410 --> 00:53:38,930
Yes, I am Lawyer Choi Yoon Hyeok.

656
00:53:38,930 --> 00:53:40,600
Please take a seat.

657
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:44,160
Since my face is my business card, I don't have to give it to you, right?

658
00:53:45,030 --> 00:53:49,430
Oh my gosh, my luxury wallet that was full with my money and cards...

659
00:53:49,430 --> 00:53:52,610
I must've left it in the restroom. Please wait for me.

660
00:53:52,610 --> 00:53:54,440
Ah, yes.

661
00:54:03,260 --> 00:54:05,040
Oh Yoon Seo?

662
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,670
No, I am not Oh Yoon Seo.

663
00:54:07,670 --> 00:54:11,050
- I must've seen wrongly. I'm sorry. 
 - Yes.

664
00:54:17,150 --> 00:54:19,940
What are you doing?

665
00:54:19,940 --> 00:54:21,970
You see, you are Oh Yoon Seo.

666
00:54:21,970 --> 00:54:25,650
Who do you think you are to lie?

667
00:54:25,650 --> 00:54:28,710
But, why are you here at a law firm?

668
00:54:31,560 --> 00:54:34,700
Because I have had some business to take care of here lately.

669
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:36,190
Oh my gosh.

670
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,670
Did you get into a lawsuit again?

671
00:54:39,670 --> 00:54:41,590
My goodness.

672
00:54:41,590 --> 00:54:45,310
How long ago was it that you made a ruckus?

673
00:54:46,910 --> 00:54:49,980
Your life is so unfortunate. So unlucky.

674
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:52,560
Even if it's to this point, it is a good thing.  You should at least put up a fight.

675
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,310
Should I give you some money?

676
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,210
Then, Unni, why did you come here?

677
00:54:57,270 --> 00:55:01,770
- Unni, didn't you come to have a consultation today? 
- Hm?

678
00:55:01,770 --> 00:55:05,060
What reason would I have to have a consultation at a law firm?

679
00:55:05,060 --> 00:55:09,970
As you know, I'm living my life so well being loved by a rich husband.

680
00:55:09,970 --> 00:55:12,710
I'm just...

681
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,440
I'm just taking a look around to buy a building.

682
00:55:15,440 --> 00:55:19,850
Ah, I'm so interested in buildings these days, you see.

683
00:55:21,510 --> 00:55:24,860
Hey, it seems like I'm bragging about myself too much, so I'm sorry!

684
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:29,610
Hey, it's impossible for you to return to the entertainment industry now and you're having such a hard time making a living.

685
00:55:29,610 --> 00:55:32,890
On top of that, it seems like you've gotten caught up in a lawsuit.

686
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:37,380
I did too much in front of you when your life is at rock bottom, didn't I?

687
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,940
Aigoo, here.

688
00:55:40,950 --> 00:55:45,920
Be careful on your way and don't get your picture taken by reporters.

689
00:55:47,130 --> 00:55:49,400
Are reporters uninterested in you now, too?

690
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:50,520
Unni!

691
00:55:50,520 --> 00:55:55,200
Seriously. That unni seems like a person who came into the world just to bully me.

692
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,750
One time, there was a dress that I picked out to wear to an award's ceremony.

693
00:55:58,750 --> 00:56:02,240
But that Unni went to a wedding ceremony and wore it.

694
00:56:02,260 --> 00:56:06,620
Another time, she went to the director of a drama that I was cast in,

695
00:56:06,620 --> 00:56:10,790
and told him that she could do a good job and she pestered him so that he would favor her much more over me.

696
00:56:10,790 --> 00:56:14,330
In the end, the main character was changed to her.

697
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:19,200
Wow. Seriously, I still get mad even when I think about what happened with that drama even now.

698
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:24,160
Mr. Lawyer, I can't take care of this legally even now?

699
00:56:24,160 --> 00:56:26,400
No. You can't.

700
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:27,670
What?

701
00:56:27,670 --> 00:56:29,980
In order for it to become a breach of duty or illegal,

702
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:32,800
it must be a tactic which disseminated  false or deceptive information.

703
00:56:32,800 --> 00:56:37,770
Hwang Yeon Doo offered better terms than you did because she said would accept a smaller guaranteed fee.

704
00:56:37,810 --> 00:56:41,100
It wasn't a tactic disseminating deceptive information.

705
00:56:44,340 --> 00:56:48,960
Wow. You're  extremely  rational.

706
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,220
What?

707
00:56:52,220 --> 00:56:57,330
Jeez. I was just venting to my boyfriend. Goodness.

708
00:56:57,330 --> 00:57:01,740
Did you think I was actually asking you for advice just then?

709
00:57:04,810 --> 00:57:07,990
For me, if someone said that someone was bullying you,

710
00:57:07,990 --> 00:57:10,890
I wouldn't worry about if you were wrong and would be on your side no matter what from the getgo.

711
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:14,120
And I think I would really hate that person.

712
00:57:15,190 --> 00:57:18,590
I guess that's not the case for you, Mr. Lawyer.

713
00:57:21,370 --> 00:57:24,660
Ah. Th-that's not it...

714
00:57:24,670 --> 00:57:27,670
And also, earlier—

715
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:30,400
Never mind.

716
00:57:52,870 --> 00:57:56,820
Then I'll go now.

717
00:57:56,820 --> 00:58:04,160
And, I'm really sorry, but I don't want today to be our day one.

718
00:58:22,790 --> 00:58:26,240
 What should I do? I don't think I'll be able to meet with you today. 

719
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:29,890
 You can't help it. Alright. 

720
00:58:29,890 --> 00:58:34,580
 It seemed like her voice was weak then. 

721
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:37,250
 Are you telling me to move to Lawyer Choi's office? 

722
00:58:37,250 --> 00:58:40,990
 I don't have anything urgent to take care of. It's okay. 

723
00:58:42,860 --> 00:58:46,920
 I think she had an upset expression on her face that time, too. 

724
00:58:46,920 --> 00:58:50,740
 But I did that for Oh Jin Sim, though, 

725
00:58:50,740 --> 00:58:53,460
 because it's good for her to experience various types of work. 

726
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:11,560
Does he even like me?

727
00:59:23,380 --> 00:59:26,000
Mr. Lawyer! Why are you here?

728
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:28,980
- Because your phone was cut off.
 - Huh?

729
00:59:28,980 --> 00:59:31,560
It's off?

730
00:59:33,260 --> 00:59:36,890
Is that why you came? To say that?

731
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:40,580
That's not it. Let's go on a date.

732
00:59:40,580 --> 00:59:43,700
What? A date?

733
00:59:50,390 --> 00:59:53,160
What are you doing so suddenly?

734
00:59:53,160 --> 00:59:57,430
Because no matter how much I thought about it, I thought that I couldn't let today pass by.

735
00:59:57,470 --> 00:59:59,620
I don't want to push it off any longer.

736
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:02,360
Let's make today our day one.

737
01:00:05,480 --> 01:00:08,630
I want to do that. Can we not?

738
01:00:08,630 --> 01:00:10,840
We can. We can.

739
01:00:14,850 --> 01:00:17,520
Then let's go.

740
01:00:17,520 --> 01:00:20,280
But where are we going to go?

741
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:35,520
Wow! This is my first time coming to an observatory.

742
01:00:35,520 --> 01:00:37,560
How did you think of coming to a place like this?

743
01:00:37,560 --> 01:00:42,810
There's not really anywhere to go for a late-night date, but it can't be somewhere that's guarded 24 hours a day.

744
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:45,880
It has to be somewhere special and not crowded,

745
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,940
so I thought of this place and that place

746
01:00:47,940 --> 01:00:51,470
and this place where we can have a date even late at night came to mind.

747
01:00:51,470 --> 01:00:54,240
- Do you like it?
 - Totally.

748
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:56,850
It's the coolest place ever!

749
01:00:57,940 --> 01:01:00,720
We must be able to see the stars well if we go that way.

750
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,530
Let's go that way.

751
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:15,550
Oh!  It's a shooting star!

752
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:21,340
- Did you see it?
 - I didn't see it.

753
01:01:21,350 --> 01:01:23,540
Aigoo, seriously.

754
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:28,930
That's why you should have run over faster. Why are you so slow?

755
01:01:32,520 --> 01:01:34,020
What?

756
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,590
Why are you looking at me like that?

757
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:38,550
Just because I feel sorry.

758
01:01:38,550 --> 01:01:40,280
What?

759
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:45,450
I'm sorry that I'm a slow person, Oh Jin Sim.

760
01:01:45,450 --> 01:01:49,380
W-well, why are you apologizing for something like that?

761
01:01:49,380 --> 01:01:54,410
Earlier, I thought about it carefully,

762
01:01:54,450 --> 01:01:56,640
and I was too indifferent.

763
01:01:56,640 --> 01:02:00,510
Confessing late, messing up our first date,

764
01:02:00,600 --> 01:02:04,150
and continuing to make you feel upset.

765
01:02:05,000 --> 01:02:09,340
It seems like it's because I'm lacking in expressing myself and am clumsy

766
01:02:09,380 --> 01:02:14,280
that those things happened. I felt bad about it.

767
01:02:15,220 --> 01:02:22,920
I'm a slow person, so I could take longer than what you're wanting.

768
01:02:22,930 --> 01:02:29,700
But, I'll approach you at my own pace, one step at a time.

769
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:34,820
Slowly, for a long time.

770
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:55,430
Um, Mr. Lawyer.

771
01:02:56,380 --> 01:03:00,520
Can I ask you something?

772
01:03:09,540 --> 01:03:13,720
Do you like me?

773
01:03:17,310 --> 01:03:19,480
What?

774
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:24,590
Nothing. Please just pretend you didn't hear that.

775
01:03:46,010 --> 01:03:48,580

778

789
01:04:57,190 --> 01:04:58,660
 Touch Your Heart
 ~ Preview ~ 

790
01:04:59,390 --> 01:05:02,090
 There will be a ton of competitors if it's someone at Oh Yoon Seo's level. 

791
01:05:02,090 --> 01:05:03,720
 If you don't want it to be taken away from you, do well, dude! 

792
01:05:03,720 --> 01:05:05,150
 Do your work. 

793
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,700
 But, are you possibly jealous? 
 - That couldn't be true? 

794
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,830
 Yoon Seo was so popular! 

795
01:05:10,830 --> 01:05:12,650
 You would see her as soon as you turned on your TV. 

796
01:05:12,650 --> 01:05:15,880
 As expected, a goddess is a goddess. 

797
01:05:16,790 --> 01:05:18,590
 I'll stay with Yoon Seo. 

798
01:05:18,590 --> 01:05:21,720
 If it's Yoon Seo, what kind of man would she date? 

799
01:05:21,720 --> 01:05:24,750
 Someone who isn't Lawyer Kwon. 

800
01:05:24,750 --> 01:05:28,000
 I wish it were me who was making Oh Jin Sim laugh. 

801
01:05:28,000 --> 01:05:33,690
 Mr. Lawyer, is it okay if I kiss you right now? 

802
01:05:33,690 --> 01:05:36,030
 Wait, right now...
