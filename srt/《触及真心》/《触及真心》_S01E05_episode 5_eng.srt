1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,940


2
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:40,940
 Touch Your Heart 

3
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,620
 Episode 5 

4
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,600
Who's calling so early in the morning?

5
00:01:08,590 --> 00:01:12,450
 I'm meeting with a client. I will be one hour late to work. 

6
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,590
 Alright, I understand. It's cold outside today, so make sure you wear something warm. 

7
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:33,020
Did I do too much?

8
00:01:33,590 --> 00:01:36,570
 You dress warmly too, Oh Jin Sim. 

9
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:51,370
Since he insisted so strongly that I wear something warm,

10
00:01:51,370 --> 00:01:54,100
I'll dress warmly.

11
00:01:54,100 --> 00:01:58,220
As expected, pink is always right. It's so pretty.

12
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:10,750
 The doors are closing. 

13
00:02:10,750 --> 00:02:14,120
One moment! Hold on a moment! Aigo, thank you.

14
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:17,390
Oh! It's Lawyer Kwon.

15
00:02:17,390 --> 00:02:19,530
 The doors are closing. 

16
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:24,360
We ended up meeting again in the elevator without fail. Even though I came to work an hour late because I was meeting with a client.

17
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:30,870
If someone heard that, they would think that I was crazy over you and waited in front of the elevator every day because I wanted to see you.

18
00:02:30,870 --> 00:02:34,950
I'm also an hour late because I was meeting with a client, you know.

19
00:02:37,570 --> 00:02:41,210
- Oh, right. I have some good news—
 - I'm not curious.

20
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:46,090
There has never been  a single time after hearing your "good news" that I have been really happy.

21
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:51,740
I'm for real this time. I have two pieces of seriously awesome, seriously happy news.

22
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:53,320
Which one should I tell you first?

23
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:57,970
One is big news, and the other is small news. Okay.

24
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:01,570
A man should be big-scale, so I'll tell you the big news first.

25
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,920
I think our Always is going to take on a huge case.

26
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:12,290
It's pretty much 99% certain, and if we end up taking it, we'll definitely become a hot issue.

27
00:03:12,290 --> 00:03:14,690
Just what kind of case is it?

28
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:17,810
That's a secret.

29
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:24,110
Alright, we'll move on to the small news. We're having a company dinner today.

30
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:29,100
Lawyer Kwon! Lawyer Kwon, why aren't you responding?

31
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:32,410
- I said that we're having a company dinner today! 
- I'm not going.

32
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:38,000
Why can't you enjoy something happy?

33
00:03:42,130 --> 00:03:45,090
- I'm late.
 - You're here?

34
00:03:51,430 --> 00:03:53,640
What is all this?

35
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,590
It's really pretty, isn't it?

36
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,500
Spring is coming now, so I decorated everything with pink.

37
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:05,820
Even though spring is coming, decorating a lawyer's office all pink is a little...

38
00:04:05,820 --> 00:04:09,430
So? You're saying that I can't?

39
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:15,820
Do you know what you are doing is infringing on my right to pursue happiness and the universal right of freedom of action?

40
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:19,350
- How do you know about...? 
- You said so at the drive-in theater.

41
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:22,400
I have a good memory, so I remember everything.

42
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:26,030
Alright. Well, do as you please.

43
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:40,110
What is all this?

44
00:04:41,480 --> 00:04:44,250
I thought that it was stingy to just decorate my room.

45
00:04:44,250 --> 00:04:47,500
But, still, I like black more than all pink.

46
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,110
No matter how much you like black,

47
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:54,060
if you use pink a little bit sometimes like this, your mood will go up.

48
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:58,750
You should assure my right to pursue happiness and universal freedom of action, as well.

49
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:01,790
Fine. I just have to remove them.

50
00:05:07,860 --> 00:05:09,710
This strawberry.

51
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,220
Ah, and this.

52
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:19,180
- Take this, too.
 - Just use it.

53
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:23,600
If I'm not here and you want to tell me something, I'd like you to write it there and stick it on my desk

54
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,030
so that neither of us will forget it. Then ...

55
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:30,800
Then.

56
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,820
Wait, this...

57
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,650
Yes.

58
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:53,990
I'll send you the certification of contents as soon as I can.

59

  Document request, completed. 

80
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,680
 Please verify and tell me the deadline for Han Sang Cheol's appeal. 

81
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,580
 The deadline for Han Sang Cheol's appeal is the 27th. 

82
00:07:30,600 --> 00:07:33,560
 You worked hard. I'm sorry for making you work too much. 

83
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,830
 No big deal. No matter when or what it is, just say the word!

88
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:55,430
Oh yes, this is Lightning Quick Delivery, right?

89
00:07:55,430 --> 00:07:58,240
I'm Lawyer Dan Moon Hui from Always Law Firm.

90
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,720
Yes.

91
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,130
I have something to send through express delivery.

92
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:06,630
Yes. I'll be waiting.

93
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,420
Ah, I wonder what he thinks of me.

94
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:21,210
Does that person also

95
00:08:21,210 --> 00:08:24,910
like me? Or not like me?

96
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:29,280
He likes me. He doesn't like me. He likes me. He doesn't like me...

97
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,970
- He likes...
 - You!

98
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:40,060
That person must also like you, too, Lawyer Dan.

99
00:08:41,020 --> 00:08:45,750
But, I've seen it done with petals, but this is the first time I've seen it done with tangerines.

100
00:08:45,750 --> 00:08:50,330
This is my first time trying it, too. Because I'm so frustrated trying to figure out how he feels.

101
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,450
What kind of person is he? Is it still just a one-sided crush?

102
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:58,000
I'm not sure.

103
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,930
I think that he likes me, too.

104
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,740
Do you want to hear about it?

105
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,340
Yeah, sure. I'm totally curious.

106
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:09,280
Well, he's the express courier who comes to our law firm frequently.

107
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,820
He talks to me in a different tone of voice than everyone else.

108
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:13,800
To other people, he just says, "You called for an express delivery, correct?"

109
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:16,800
But to me, he speaks in a high voice and says, "Your delivery is here!"

110
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:20,390
As if he's excited to see me!  That's not the only thing.

111
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,690
If you order something through quick service five times, then they give you the sixth delivery for free.

112
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:27,450
But even though I haven't ordered more than four times,

113
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:30,070
he gave me this key chain for free.

114
00:09:30,070 --> 00:09:33,800
When one loves it's why one wants to give generously.

115
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,020
Wow, it's pretty!

116
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:39,960
That person must have fallen head over heels for you, Lawyer Dan.

117
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:42,030
Really?

118
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:46,500
Since you've said that and you have a lot of dating experience, I totally believe it.

119
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:48,690
I don't have any dating experience, though.

120
00:09:48,690 --> 00:09:51,100
Ah, that's right! I saw it in an interview.

121
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:53,300
I heard that you've been single your whole life.

122
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,180
But even though I don't have dating experince, I am a good dating coach.

123
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:02,800
I was the MC of the center room of the couple matching program.

124
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:06,320
So from what I can see,

125
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,540
- this is 100% for certain.
 - I don't know!

126
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,940
Yay!

127
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:15,480
It's a secret.

128
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,050
What in the world?! She must really like him!

129
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,450
Tangerines?

130
00:10:26,450 --> 00:10:30,130
Shall I try it one time, too?

131
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,230
Alright.

132
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,830
He likes me. He doesn't like me.

133
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:50,460
He likes me.

134
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:54,840
He doesn't like me.

135
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,820
 Likes me, doesn't like me, likes me, doesn't like me. 

136
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:02,000
He likes me!

137
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,110
 Oh Jin Sim, it's time to go to trial. 

138
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:12,040
 Alright. 

139
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,880
Because the defendant's alibi was proven, in other words,

140
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,120
the fact of his absence from the scene, as a result of the thorough interrogation of the principal witness,

141
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,930
I ask that the defendant be acquitted.

142
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:39,580
Seems like we will win, right?

143
00:11:39,580 --> 00:11:40,980
Yes, maybe.

144
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,320
Don't pretend to be so humble.

145
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:47,210
Since you're smiling, that means you're already certain of it.

146
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:50,600
You look so happy because you're going to win. I think you're born to be a lawyer.

147
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:57,170
By the way, why did you become a lawyer?

148
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:04,250
I heard most of your colleagues became prosecutors.

149
00:12:04,250 --> 00:12:07,120
Lawyers get paid more.

150
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,980
What? Did he just say he became a lawyer for the money?

151
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,490
He's so honest! He gets more charming the more I get to know him.

152
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:27,570
It's already lunch time. Shall we eat first and go?

153
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:29,300
Sure.

154
00:12:33,990 --> 00:12:35,490
What's that?

155
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,380
Oh, that's right!

156
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,570
What if she asks him out for coffee again?

157
00:12:40,570 --> 00:12:45,790
No, since it's lunch time, she may ask him out to eat together.

158
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:48,420
Aren't we going?

159
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:53,480
I'm coming! Let's go!

160
00:12:55,150 --> 00:12:57,050
Kwon Jeong Rok!

161
00:12:57,050 --> 00:12:58,680
- There's a UFO! 
 - What is it?

162
00:12:58,680 --> 00:13:00,700
Look! It went that way!

163
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:03,300
Hurry up! Let's go!

164
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:05,250
Hey, Jeong Rok!

165
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:06,360
Hey.

166
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:07,760
Had a trial?

167
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,560
Yes.

168
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,850
We're meeting quite often recently.

169
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,190
So, you don't like that?

170
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:14,830
You're here too, Secretary Oh.

171
00:13:14,830 --> 00:13:16,970
Yes, well...

172
00:13:16,970 --> 00:13:20,530
If you have time,  shall we do lunch?   How about pasta?

173
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:22,050
Pasta?

174
00:13:22,050 --> 00:13:25,530
To be honest, I have something to tell you.

175
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:30,260
- Is it something important? 
 - Yes, extremely.

176
00:13:30,260 --> 00:13:33,260
And... it's kind of a secret too.

177
00:13:34,550 --> 00:13:37,810
I'm sorry but will you please go ahead?

178
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:39,490
Pardon?

179
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,380
Go ahead?

180
00:13:45,380 --> 00:13:48,020
He promised to eat with me first! Why is he not keeping the promise?

181
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:50,440
I like it so much...

182
00:13:51,020 --> 00:13:52,910
I mean the pasta!

183
00:13:56,970 --> 00:14:00,750
So, what's that important and secret thing you have to tell me?

184
00:14:02,650 --> 00:14:05,020
You know that case of Im Yoon Hui?

185
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,040
I will be in charge of it.

186
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:11,210
A women who was assaulted by her husband for several years

187
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:14,450
stabbed him to death while being assaulted?

188
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,610
Would this be a murder or self-defense?

189
00:14:16,610 --> 00:14:18,630
What do you think?

190
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,940
But if self-defense is once accepted,

191
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,990
it's a burden for the prosecutor in charge of course,

192
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:28,690
and every other victim in the future will plead self-defense

193
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,100
and every lawyer will cite this as judicial precedent and assert self-defense.

194
00:14:33,650 --> 00:14:36,230
It's quite a sensitive problem for us.

195
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:40,650
In this situation, it's hard to determine what exactly should be said.

196
00:14:40,650 --> 00:14:42,330
Yes, isn't it?

197
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:46,320
It's not that I expected an answer when I asked.

198
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,900
I just took this case as a golden opportunity,

199
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:52,000
but I feel a bit clueless.

200
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:01,380
Shall we go have a cup of coffee?

201
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,960
No thanks, I have to head back now.

202
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:06,380
Why? Isn't it still lunch time?

203
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:09,130
I have something to do. Let's meet again next time.

204
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,410
I wonder what's making him so busy.

205
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:23,060
Why are you there?

206
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,770
This, I'm going to take it back.

207
00:15:24,770 --> 00:15:29,050
You're not someone who deserves to posses these memos.

208
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:31,250
Is a qualification required?  To have a memo?

209
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:35,910
Why? You said you don't want it and now you do?

210
00:15:35,910 --> 00:15:38,300
No, but I'm just wondering why you're taking back what you gave already.

211
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:41,880
That's up to the donor's intent.  If you have a  complaint, just sue me.

212
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:43,780
It's not something to sue over.

213
00:15:43,780 --> 00:15:46,910
There's still 20 minutes left. Why don't we go out for a quick lunch?

214
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,560
I don't feel like eating!

215
00:15:52,770 --> 00:15:55,410
I feel like you have been glaring at me since earlier.

216
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:59,230
No, I'm not. I hear a lot that I have a piercing gaze.

217
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:03,600
Actors are supposed be strong at staring at the cameras.

218
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:13,730
Thank you. Work hard.

219
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,600
- Excuse me, 
 - Yes?

220
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:18,890
Yes? Do you have something to say?

221
00:16:18,890 --> 00:16:22,310
This may be presumptuous, but let's eat something together one day.

222
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:26,480
- Pardon me? 
 - How about tomorrow? Shall we go eat something delicious?

223
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,260
Umm... I don't think I'll be hungry tomorrow.

224
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:32,640
Then, let's go to a movie! Do you like romantic movies?

225
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,650
- How is  "Love of Titicaca"? 

226
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:35,700
I saw it yesterday.

227
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,990
It's being released tomorrow.

228
00:16:37,990 --> 00:16:39,790
Oh... it's tomorrow...

229
00:16:39,790 --> 00:16:44,070
I'll just speak directly.

230
00:16:44,070 --> 00:16:46,100
I like you too.

231
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:47,600
"Too"?

232
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:51,170
So... I want to see a movie together

233
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:55,800
and eat out together to get to know more about you.

234
00:16:57,990 --> 00:17:02,260
Umm, I'm sorry but this situation is too sudden.

235
00:17:02,260 --> 00:17:05,440
Could you give me some time to think about it?

236
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:08,990
Of course!

237
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,120
- For how long? 
 - About 10 years?

238
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:16,060
Take care.

239
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:23,330
I'll head home right after meeting with the client.

240
00:17:23,330 --> 00:17:24,950
Okay.

241
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:29,420
Did I do something to hurt you?

242
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:34,500
Is it because I didn't keep the promise before to have lunch together?

243
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,040
No, it's not.

244
00:17:37,040 --> 00:17:38,160
Then, why?

245
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:40,630
Do I have to tell you everything?

246
00:17:40,630 --> 00:17:44,640
Don't you know about the freedom of privacy in our constitution?

247
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,590
Did I tell you that too?

248
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:50,690
Nope. I studied on my own. It's in Article 17 of the constitution.

249
00:17:53,030 --> 00:17:55,990
Anyway, that is not what's important now!

250
00:17:56,860 --> 00:18:00,890
Okay, freedom of privacy. I'll keep that in mind.

251
00:18:00,890 --> 00:18:03,290
Wait.

252
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,190
I want to ask one thing.

253
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:10,430
Between the movie  "Avatar"  you watched in 2009

254
00:18:10,430 --> 00:18:13,430
and the one we saw last week,  "What's Wrong with the Lawyer," 

255
00:18:13,430 --> 00:18:16,170
which one did you like more?

256
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,480
Pardon?

257
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:22,220
Which one was more fun and memorable to you?

258
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,130
 "Avatar"  was unique so it was fresh

259
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:30,850
and  "What's Wrong with the Lawyer"  was fun because I empathized with it a lot.

260
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:34,160
So, you mean...

261
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,720
you like both? You can't give up either one of them?

262
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,960
You're such a bad person!

263
00:18:52,270 --> 00:18:53,970
Then, I'll see you on the day of the trial.

264
00:18:53,970 --> 00:18:57,460
Yes, let me know if you need anything more.

265
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,470
Take care.

266
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:07,160
 Please verify each person who will be attending as a witness 

267
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:11,060
 on the day of next week's hearing and tell me at court. 

268
00:19:21,530 --> 00:19:23,800
"kk"?

269
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:29,940
Why in the world is she acting like this?

270
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,540
Would it have been better to have gotten a private room?

271
00:19:43,540 --> 00:19:48,010
Yoon Seo, is it okay to have the firm meal  in this open space?

272
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:51,470
Of course. I will sit in the corner.

273
00:19:51,470 --> 00:19:54,790
Is Lawyer Kwon not coming again?

274
00:19:54,790 --> 00:19:59,130
Has he ever obediently attended a company dinner?

275
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:03,010
Over there. He's obediently attending.

276
00:20:11,720 --> 00:20:13,130
Cheers!

277
00:20:13,130 --> 00:20:15,870
It's been a long time since we all got together.

278
00:20:20,650 --> 00:20:23,270
Ms. Dan, why are drinking so fast?

279
00:20:23,270 --> 00:20:24,920
She was dumped again

280
00:20:24,920 --> 00:20:27,250
by that delivery man.

281
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:28,150
Really?

282
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:32,820
Wow, how quick is that?  She fell as fast as lighting and was dumped as fast as lighting.

283
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:38,360
You must be busy to be dumped every once a week. Once a week, consistently, her heart is broken.

284
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:41,640
Pardon me?

285
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:49,400
Anyway, what happened? Even up to this morning, you said you weren't coming.

286
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:51,000
What changed your mind?

287
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:52,620
Well...

288
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,930
Why are you looking at Yoon Seo?

289
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,020
No way. You came to see her?

290
00:21:00,020 --> 00:21:03,860
Yes, I came to see Oh Jin Sim. I did.

291
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,970
Wow. That's straightforward.

292
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,960
Then, are you two in a "some" relationship?

293
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:12,540
What do you mean, "some"?  What kind of nonsense is that? No way.

294
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,660
But then why is he saying something so weird?

295
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:19,650
It's not something weird. I really came to see her.

296
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,340
I have something to ask her.

297
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:23,130
Like what?

298
00:21:23,130 --> 00:21:27,510
She's been diligent working and very enthusiastic, trying to study  the law.

299
00:21:27,510 --> 00:21:30,460
However, for some reason, today her work attitude has been very half-hearted

300
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:33,200
and she complained to me.

301
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:36,930
I know she won't do that without a reason so I came here to ask about it.

302
00:21:36,930 --> 00:21:40,840
Oh Jin Sim, why in the world are you angry at me?

303
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:43,730
Oh, Jeez.

304
00:21:43,730 --> 00:21:47,240
Wait. Why are you asking that when everyone is here?

305
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:50,130
Yes, I want to hear what you say in front of everyone else here

306
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:54,210
and if most people think it's my problem, I will try to fix it.

307
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:57,560
So, please feel free to speak up.

308
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:07,870
You said that it's not because I couldn't keep my promise to have lunch with you.

309
00:22:07,870 --> 00:22:14,130
Then could it be you are angry because I didn't let you decorate the office in pink?

310
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,760
What's all that?

311
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:20,960
Umm... It's just... I love pink.

312
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:23,530
Yes... I do...

313
00:22:23,530 --> 00:22:30,900
But I decorated his room in pink but he didn't like it so I...

314
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:33,330
But that's not the reason.

315
00:22:33,330 --> 00:22:37,100
Then, is it because I gave you too much work today?

316
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:39,470
Because I kept on writing on the memo about what to do?

317
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:43,450
Hey. This guy is so inhumane.

318
00:22:43,500 --> 00:22:46,600
You should've made face-to-face contact when you had a request!

319
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:50,100
How uncomfortable would she feel if you just write the memo and throw it on the desk?

320
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:54,360
- Don't you think so too? 
- No, It's not about that!

321
00:22:55,040 --> 00:23:00,430
Actually, I didn't have a specific reason but...

322
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:03,730
I was so hungry,

323
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:07,550
so I think I was a little overly sensitive without realizing it.

324
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,760
Oh I see.

325
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:23,070
I'm sorry that I behaved in a way that caused a misunderstanding, Mr. Lawyer.

326
00:23:23,070 --> 00:23:26,960
It's nothing. I'm glad that the misunderstanding was cleared.

327
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,670
So it was nothing much, then!

328
00:23:28,670 --> 00:23:31,440
Alright. Let's have a toast in the name of making up!

329
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:34,080
No, what toast?

330
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:43,380
Lawyer Kwon must feel at ease because the misunderstanding was cleared up. Hurry.

331
00:23:45,390 --> 00:23:47,310
Cheers.

332
00:23:49,670 --> 00:23:51,870
Good job!

333
00:23:55,500 --> 00:23:57,280
Eat.

334
00:23:57,280 --> 00:23:59,060
Yes, sir.

335
00:24:15,230 --> 00:24:20,600
Mr. Lawyer, have a talk with me.

336
00:24:21,340 --> 00:24:22,920
Yes.

337
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:26,010
Did we not clear up the misunderstanding?

338
00:24:26,010 --> 00:24:28,760
So what else do you have to say?

339
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,610
Why did you do that?

340
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:35,230
- Why on earth did you do that?
 - Wait, what?

341
00:24:35,230 --> 00:24:40,280
What happened between us two should just stay between us.

342
00:24:40,280 --> 00:24:44,730
Why did you blab about it in front of a bunch of other people? Why?

343
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:47,430
What do you mean, blab? I told you this earlier,

344
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:49,970
but I wanted to hear what you had to say in a place where everyone else was,

345
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:52,490
and if the majority of them said I was wrong, I—

346
00:24:52,490 --> 00:24:54,860
Is this a trial?

347
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:59,820
If you argue and try to find things out in front of a bunch of other people, that's a trial!

348
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,630
I'm sorry if I offended you. But I put in an effort to clear the misunderstanding—

349
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:09,580
Cleared the misunderstanding, my foot.

350
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:12,190
We still haven't cleared it, you know!

351
00:25:12,190 --> 00:25:17,800
Why is that? Because there is another reason

352
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:22,250
why I'm angry at you, Mr. Lawyer.

353
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:24,280
What is that?

354
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:31,060
Why did you eat the pasta all by yourself?

355
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:36,840
Why didn't you eat with me? I wanted to eat it, too!

356
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:44,800
Then you've been acting like that all day because you couldn't eat pasta? Then let's go eat pasta tomorrow and—

357
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:53,060
Why did you do that? Why did you eat with someone else?

358
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,250
Pasta!

359
00:25:58,210 --> 00:26:00,410
Pasta!

360
00:26:03,990 --> 00:26:08,890
I also like pasta.

361
00:26:18,650 --> 00:26:21,180
- You're here?
 - Yeah.

362
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,670
Oh, yeah. Joo Won said he saw you as he was passing by.

363
00:26:23,670 --> 00:26:26,270
He said that you ate pasta with Yeo Reum today.

364
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,430
Is this that pasta talk again?

365
00:26:28,430 --> 00:26:31,330
What do you mean, again? This is my first time talking about it.

366
00:26:31,330 --> 00:26:34,160
So, what? What's wrong with eating pasta? What about it? Why, why?

367
00:26:34,160 --> 00:26:36,830
I'm saying that I'm jealous.

368
00:26:36,830 --> 00:26:38,800
What? Jealous?

369
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:42,150
Of course! I'm like this because I broke up with Yeo Reum for right now,

370
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,870
but I haven't gotten over my feelings for her yet.

371
00:26:43,870 --> 00:26:46,910
But when I think about the person that I have feelings for eating pasta with another man,

372
00:26:46,910 --> 00:26:49,020
do you think I wouldn't get angry?

373
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,710
Getting angry that you ate pasta with someone else...

374
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,500
Does that mean you have feelings for that person?

375
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:00,300
What?

376
00:27:11,150 --> 00:27:14,280
Having feelings, he said...

377
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:29,210
Oppa. Shall we go to look at the sea?

378
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:34,100
Why are you saying something so random so early in the morning? You have to go to work.

379
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:37,590
That's right. I have to go to work.

380
00:27:37,590 --> 00:27:41,840
Did you possibly drink alcohol and make a mistake again yesterday?

381
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:45,390
Who created alcohol?

382
00:27:45,390 --> 00:27:47,840
You did. You so did.

383
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,740
That's what I want to ask. Who on earth created alcohol

384
00:27:50,740 --> 00:27:53,370
so that it drives you to do unnecessary things every time you drink it?

385
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:55,930
What mistake did you make this time?

386
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:56,940
I don't know.

387
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:00,940
Yeah, right. Hurry up and tell me what you did! Then I'll be able to take care of it or make an excuse for you.

388
00:28:00,940 --> 00:28:04,810
I don't know! I said that I don't know! I want to be alone, so let me out!

389
00:28:05,630 --> 00:28:07,840
H-here?

390
00:28:10,400 --> 00:28:12,090
We're almost at the law firm.

391
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:15,140
Already? We're already almost there?

392
00:28:18,700 --> 00:28:23,020
What should I do? How should I act?

393
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,600
What should I do?

394
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:29,430
Hello.

395
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,310
Yes. Good morning.

396
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,180
Oh Jin Sim.

397
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,470
Yes?

398
00:28:49,470 --> 00:28:53,170
In the case in which a judgment was rendered yesterday, please verify  that the certificate of service of the judgment was done.

399
00:28:53,170 --> 00:28:59,120
And please check to see if a notice of appeal has been filed.

400
00:28:59,120 --> 00:29:01,070
Yes, sir.

401
00:29:02,110 --> 00:29:05,680
Um... Mr. Lawyer.

402
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,170
About what I said yesterday.

403
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:14,050
Yes? What did you...?

404
00:29:14,050 --> 00:29:22,370
When I asked why you ate pasta with someone else instead of me.

405
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:27,350
I asked you that as a friend.

406
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:29,300
A friend, you said?

407
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,770
Yeah. Women are naturally like that.

408
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:35,510
When I was in school, my closest and best friend

409
00:29:35,510 --> 00:29:40,500
went to eat rice cakes with someone else. I was so upset about it.

410
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:43,190
I felt like my friend had been stolen.

411
00:29:43,970 --> 00:29:50,790
But, honestly, we're best friends here at Always Law Firm.

412
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:53,410
Best  friends?

413
00:29:53,410 --> 00:29:55,960
Yes. We're totally close friends.

414
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,830
We work in the closest proximity to each other. We eat together.

415
00:29:58,830 --> 00:30:00,750
We take care of cases together.

416
00:30:00,750 --> 00:30:03,320
Where is a closer friend than that?

417
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:08,630
But since my closest friend looked like he was close with someone else,

418
00:30:08,630 --> 00:30:12,500
I was a little upset. A little.

419
00:30:12,500 --> 00:30:14,570
It's childish, isn't it?

420
00:30:14,570 --> 00:30:17,440
My face isn't the only thing that seems younger than it is.

421
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,550
My mind is also younger than it seems.

422
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:31,860
So please forget what happened yesterday. Okay?

423
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,850
Yes, I understand.

424
00:30:35,910 --> 00:30:38,990
Lawyer Kwon. The CEO is calling for you.

425
00:30:38,990 --> 00:30:40,610
Alright.

426
00:30:41,450 --> 00:30:42,880
I'll be back.

427
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,700
Yes.

428
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:55,270
What am I doing right now?

429
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:01,410
You said you have something to tell me.

430
00:31:01,410 --> 00:31:05,340
Ah, have I not told you yet? Oh, I did. I told you.

431
00:31:05,340 --> 00:31:08,350
I told you that I thought something good was going to happen, didn't I?

432
00:31:08,350 --> 00:31:12,950
I told you that  I thought we would take on a case that would make us become a big issue.

433
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,500
Were you disappointed in the end?

434
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,500
Just, well...

435
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:23,020
Here.  Read this once.  You're going to have to do it with this.

436
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:28,590
Isn't this the Im Yoon Hui case?

437
00:31:28,590 --> 00:31:30,880
It's the hottest news out right now.

438
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,820
You defend her and get it declared as self-defense.

439
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:38,230
- I can't do it. 
- Why can't you? Why can't you do this?

440
00:31:38,230 --> 00:31:42,050
If I give you a big case, you should be thankful and take it. Why are you rebelling again?

441
00:31:42,050 --> 00:31:44,200
I'm not rebelling. I'm just not capable of doing it.

442
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:47,480
I am in charge of a total of 32 cases altogether right now.

443
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:51,440
But, still. It's a waste not to take a case that the whole world is focusing their attention on.

444
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,300
If it's that much of a waste, you should do it yourself, CEO.

445
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:58,780
You're not busy with anything these days. And you're not getting cast on any TV shows, anyway.

446
00:31:58,780 --> 00:32:02,440
Let's not talk about TV shows. I'm not going to do them even if they ask me, anyway.

447
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,410
I just had a broadcast trauma.

448
00:32:04,410 --> 00:32:08,710
I just wasn't in good condition that day, but there were so many hateful comments.

449
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:14,250
"Did you really pass the bar exam?"  I was shaking like a trembling aspen.  "Aren't you a puppet boss?"

450
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,380
It was too much. It was so humiliating.

451
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:20,550
So from now on, don't even mention the first syllable of the word "broadcast"  ("bangseong")  from now on.

452
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:22,030
CEO, right here, your cush ...-  ("bangseok") 

453
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:25,290
I told you not to mention broadcasts in front of me!

454
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:27,110
- Your cushion fell—
 - No, don't!

455
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,870
Your cushion.( "bangseok" )

456
00:32:32,430 --> 00:32:34,540
Is this a cushion?

457
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:37,310
This is a blanket.( "banghae" )

458
00:32:39,270 --> 00:32:41,190
Anyway, you're taking this case.

459
00:32:41,190 --> 00:32:43,910
Maybe it's because for a while you have been handling  many public interest cases,

460
00:32:43,910 --> 00:32:47,940
a women's organization requested you be in charge of it.

461
00:32:53,090 --> 00:32:55,380
 Ms. Im Arrested by Police for Murdering her Husband 

462
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,190
 From Victim of Domestic Violence to Murder 

463
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:01,080
Read this carefully and if there are any other articles related to it, please find them.

464
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:02,730
Alright.

465
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,490
I saw this in the news.

466
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:08,280
Are you taking over this case?

467
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,070
It ended up that way somehow.

468
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:11,850
That's good.

469
00:33:11,850 --> 00:33:14,720
If someone skilled like you defends her,

470
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,180
then won't this be acknowledged as a case of self-defense?

471
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:22,250
Oh Jin Sim, do you think this is a case of self-defense?

472
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:26,390
Yes. She said she was being severely beaten by her husband

473
00:33:26,390 --> 00:33:29,030
and did it by accident.

474
00:33:29,740 --> 00:33:31,980
It isn't that simple.

475
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:36,890
And for it to be acknowledged as self-defense, several prerequisites are needed.

476
00:33:36,890 --> 00:33:39,050
Prerequisites?

477
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:41,770
 Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum 

478
00:33:45,650 --> 00:33:48,660
Miss Lawyer, Miss Im Yoon Hui will arrive soon.

479
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:51,510
Alright. We'll keep it simple for today.

480
00:33:51,510 --> 00:33:52,870
- She's coming!
 - She's coming, she's coming!

481
00:33:52,870 --> 00:33:55,020
 In order for it  to be acknowledged as self-defense, 

482
00:33:55,020 --> 00:33:59,050
 an attack against oneself or a third party has to occur. 

483
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:03,540
 And that attack has to be happening right then in front of one's eyes. 

484
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:07,740
 Finally, no matter how much one claims that an action was taken in order to defend oneself, 

485
00:34:07,740 --> 00:34:10,700
 in the end, the level of action cannot be excessive. 

486
00:34:10,700 --> 00:34:14,170
To put it simply, no matter how much someone claims that they did something in order to defend herself,

487
00:34:14,170 --> 00:34:16,990
that level can't be too excessive.

488
00:34:16,990 --> 00:34:20,230
For example, if someone slaps you in the face with their hand,

489
00:34:20,230 --> 00:34:23,210
you can't hit them with a weapon.

490
00:34:23,210 --> 00:34:27,600
This does not get acknowledged as self-defense because it is an excessive defense of oneself.

491
00:34:29,130 --> 00:34:31,520
There were similar cases in the past,

492
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:34,980
but none of them were acknowledged as self-defense by the supreme court in the end.

493
00:34:34,980 --> 00:34:38,070
And the prosecution will use similar precedent as their basis.

494
00:34:38,070 --> 00:34:41,120
Then you just have to use this opportunity to create a new precedent, Mr. Lawyer,

495
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:43,510
and have it declared as self-defense.

496
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:47,590
It's possible that she may have killed her husband on purpose.

497
00:34:48,730 --> 00:34:51,550
Anyway, please find those additional articles that I asked you for.

498
00:34:51,550 --> 00:34:53,250
Yes, sir.

499
00:34:55,600 --> 00:35:01,270
Im Yoon Hui, from now on, I will refer to you as the victim.

500
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:04,090
You have the right to refuse to make a statement.

501
00:35:04,090 --> 00:35:07,400
You also have the right to reject any questions.

502
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,730
Even if you don't testify, you will not be penalized

503
00:35:09,730 --> 00:35:13,240
and you have the right to obtain legal representation during questioning.

504
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:16,960
Im Yoon Hui, have you received notice of your right to refuse to give a statement?

505
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,080
Then would you like to receive a lawyer's assistance

506
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:24,750
or shall we just start the interrogation?

507
00:35:29,310 --> 00:35:32,700
- Why did you call me?
 - Why? Are you busy?

508
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:35,850
I was investigating Im Yoon Hui's case.

509
00:35:35,850 --> 00:35:37,780
What do you think? Do you see a loophole?

510
00:35:37,780 --> 00:35:41,970
I'm not sure. I think I should go to the detention center tomorrow and meet with Im Yoon Hui first for now.

511
00:35:41,970 --> 00:35:45,130
As expected. You work hard at whatever work you take on.

512
00:35:45,130 --> 00:35:50,070
So did you call me to see if I was working hard or not?

513
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:53,840
This person, seriously. Would I really have called you because of that?

514
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:58,050
Pick out a necktie for me. This one is for a fatally sexy guy

515
00:35:58,050 --> 00:36:01,730
and this one is for a fresh guy. Which one is better?

516
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,690
What are you doing right now?

517
00:36:07,690 --> 00:36:09,630
Actually, I got cast on a TV show.

518
00:36:09,630 --> 00:36:12,100
They said they're coming to the law firm to interview me tomorrow.

519
00:36:12,100 --> 00:36:17,430
Didn't you just say a little while ago that you wouldn't appear on a TV show even if they cast you because you have trauma from TV shows?

520
00:36:17,430 --> 00:36:19,270
Confucius said,

521
00:36:19,270 --> 00:36:22,880
"Our greatest glory is not in never falling,

522
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,380
but in rising every time we fall."

523
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:28,140
I failed at my first TV show appearance because I was a bit nervous,

524
00:36:28,140 --> 00:36:31,200
but I'll put that failure behind me and rise once again.

525
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:34,440
If I happen to fail again, I'll get up once more.

526
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:36,930
I'm also going to get up right now.

527
00:36:39,220 --> 00:36:42,140
I think I should drink some coffee because I've gotten so tired.

528
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,810
Okay, make mine nice and black.

529
00:36:43,810 --> 00:36:48,700
Wait a second, Yoon Seo! What should we do about Yoon Seo?

530
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:51,550
The broadcasting station said that they were filming this and that in various locations,

531
00:36:51,550 --> 00:36:54,680
so they didn't know the exact time they would arrive tomorrow.

532
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:59,360
It will be really troublesome if the filming team catches sight of her as they go back and forth.

533
00:36:59,360 --> 00:37:03,320
But we can't make her go to the coffee shop the whole day because of that, either.

534
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:05,220
Well, things will work out somehow.

535
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:09,440
Can't this large law firm find a way to hide Yeon Soo?

536
00:37:09,970 --> 00:37:12,030
Sexy guy

537
00:37:12,660 --> 00:37:15,380
or fresh guy? What do you think? Is this one better?

538
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:17,450
- Go with the sexy guy. 
- Sexy guy.

539
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:21,630
This one is better.

540
00:37:30,870 --> 00:37:34,100
Should I make you a cup of coffee as well, Mr. Lawyer?

541
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:37,580
No. I'll drink my own.

542
00:37:50,010 --> 00:37:54,090
Oh Jin Sim, I'm going to the detention center to meet with Im Yoon Hui tomorrow.

543
00:37:54,090 --> 00:37:56,880
- Would you go with me?
 - Me, too?

544
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,740
Yes. Well, you can't go with me to the lawyer reception area,

545
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:05,070
but if you go with me to the detention center, it will help you with your legal life in the future.

546
00:38:05,070 --> 00:38:09,540
Of course! It would be much more helpful than not going!

547
00:38:09,540 --> 00:38:13,530
Thank you for thinking of me to this extent.

548
00:38:14,790 --> 00:38:17,260
Let's drink our coffee.

549
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:28,900
If it's the detention center, we'll drive the car

550
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:32,600
and go really far away.

551
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:38,740
Aigo. Then... We'll be...

552
00:38:42,850 --> 00:38:46,050
Let's prepare as vigorously as the distance we are traveling,

553
00:38:46,050 --> 00:38:48,330
because we're going to work. Yeah.

554
00:38:52,120 --> 00:38:54,490
What should I wear tomorrow?

555
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:59,370
If my clothes are weird, then my mood will be brought down.

556
00:38:59,370 --> 00:39:02,770
Then I won't be able to focus on work.

557
00:39:02,770 --> 00:39:08,330
If my skin is dry, I won't be able to focus on work because I'll be worried about my skin.

558
00:39:08,330 --> 00:39:12,420
I must be a true workaholic.

559
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:28,350
♫  Yes, for me everything is new  ♫

560
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:31,030
♫  What will it be feeling like? You know, right?  ♫

561
00:39:31,030 --> 00:39:33,780
♫  Anything HIP and elegant  ♫

562
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,650
♫  Well ... that's complicated  ♫

563
00:39:36,650 --> 00:39:39,550
♫  Even if I'm acting as though I don't know, I'm pretending
  ♫

564
00:39:39,550 --> 00:39:42,000
♫  Be careful not to be intimidated
  ♫

565
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,230
Mmm! 
♫  Yes, I am 'Thunder" giving off flashes  ♫

566
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:49,280
♫  Expect me to be loud
  ♫

567
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:54,980
♫  “Hi lovely! We’re beautiful no matter how we doodley”  ♫

568
00:39:54,980 --> 00:39:59,200
♫  It's hard.  Try saying it more simply  ♫

569
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:01,290
♫  My sincerity is visible  ♫

570
00:40:01,290 --> 00:40:04,540
Good morning, sir. 
♫  My feelings are displayed there.  ♫

571
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:09,800
That tie looks good on you. 
♫  Perhaps a very heart pounding new day. So what you gonna do? What you gonna do  ♫

572
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:13,010
Your necklace is pretty.

573
00:40:13,010 --> 00:40:16,790
♫  Don't act like you don't know
  ♫

574
00:40:16,790 --> 00:40:19,000
Please, get in. It's cold. 
♫  You're going to fall for me
  ♫

575
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:23,010
♫  So what you gonna do? What you gonna do? Woo hoo!  ♫

576
00:40:25,330 --> 00:40:28,500
It's been so long since I've been on a drive. This is so nice.

577
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:32,320
This isn't a drive. We're going to the detention center to work.

578
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:36,510
If you're in a car, then it's a drive.

579
00:40:43,410 --> 00:40:46,010
Yes. This is Kwon Jeong Rok.

580
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:50,290
Yes, I understand.

581
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:56,510
The detention center just got in touch with me. They said that their reception time has been delayed by two hours.

582
00:40:56,510 --> 00:40:58,520
Really?

583
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:02,310
It's almost lunchtime. Let's go somewhere and get something to eat.

584
00:41:02,310 --> 00:41:07,730
Actually, I made a lunchbox.

585
00:41:07,730 --> 00:41:09,540
A lunchbox?

586
00:41:09,540 --> 00:41:13,360
Well, it's a waste of time to go around looking for a restaurant.

587
00:41:13,360 --> 00:41:16,430
I did it so we can save time and focus on work.

588
00:41:17,330 --> 00:41:22,300
And eating a lunchbox outside with a pretty view is also my fantasy.

589
00:41:23,390 --> 00:41:27,030
Well, we have a lot of time still. Let's do that.

590
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,200
Yes.

591
00:41:49,030 --> 00:41:52,190
Shall we just go inside and eat?

592
00:41:52,190 --> 00:41:54,810
I'll just eat here.

593
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:57,930
Why? It's cold here.

594
00:41:57,930 --> 00:41:59,890
You said it's your fantasy.

595
00:42:03,380 --> 00:42:06,400
You cook better than I thought you would.

596
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:08,190
Just how were you thinking I would?

597
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,360
I've played as a chef of Korean cuisine on a drama, you know.

598
00:42:11,360 --> 00:42:13,850
Back then, I learned from a professional

599
00:42:13,850 --> 00:42:16,880
and now I can cook Korean food like this easily even with my eyes closed.

600
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:20,730
An actress sure experiences a lot of different lifestyles as a part of the job.

601
00:42:20,730 --> 00:42:23,780
I think it would be very interesting.

602
00:42:23,780 --> 00:42:27,690
Back then, I was really happy.

603
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:36,120
Mr. Lawyer, when do you feel happy?

604
00:42:37,890 --> 00:42:39,830
On payday?

605
00:42:39,830 --> 00:42:43,270
What is that? You said that you became a lawyer because you can make a lot of money.

606
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:46,420
You must really like money.

607
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:52,040
This won't do. Let's go inside.

608
00:42:52,040 --> 00:42:54,860
If you catch a cold, I'd be the only one at a disadvantage.

609
00:42:54,860 --> 00:42:59,260
- What? Why would you be at a disadvantage?
 - Huh?

610
00:43:01,600 --> 00:43:04,930
You're our law firm's ace,

611
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:09,220
so if it's revealed that you caught a cold while having a picnic outside with me,

612
00:43:09,220 --> 00:43:11,810
how self-conscious do you think I'd feel?

613
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:16,220
That's a heavy loss of power.

614
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:19,550
Alright.

615
00:43:35,970 --> 00:43:39,220
If you're cold, you should put your hands in the pockets.

616
00:43:42,510 --> 00:43:44,390
Really?

617
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:50,710
- Thank you.
- Yes, well...

618
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:04,160
I meant for you to put your hands in your own pockets.

619
00:44:07,130 --> 00:44:11,350
It's cold. ... I'm sorry.

620
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,280
My pockets...

621
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:33,110
Sunbaenim, aren't you uncomfortable living at your friend's place?

622
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:36,300
It's uncomfortable because he's such a prickly guy.

623
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:40,200
Then it wouldn't be nice to be stuck at home together on the weekends.

624
00:44:40,200 --> 00:44:42,810
Do you want to go watch a movie with me?

625
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:45,580
I think that would be more uncomfortable.

626
00:44:50,220 --> 00:44:52,390
It's Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum.

627
00:44:58,440 --> 00:45:02,670
Her insides must be roiling these days because of Im Yoon Hui's case.

628
00:45:02,670 --> 00:45:06,060
Why? Did she say something isn't going well?

629
00:45:06,060 --> 00:45:09,010
Prosecutor Im was ambitious and wanted to take on Im Yoon Hu's case,

630
00:45:09,010 --> 00:45:10,900
but Prosecutor Yoo took it on instead.

631
00:45:10,900 --> 00:45:15,240
Prosecutor Im is seething with resentment.  It's worse than just being earnest.

632
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:24,420
Ah, it's the new kid who came from the Special Forces. Kim Se Won's hanger-on.

633
00:45:24,420 --> 00:45:28,300
But why are they sticking so close together? Are the two dating?

634
00:45:30,270 --> 00:45:34,510
Her father is a glorious high-ranking public official.

635
00:45:34,510 --> 00:45:38,830
The son of a hospital director and the daughter of a high ranking government official.

636
00:45:38,830 --> 00:45:42,900
That's nice for them.  Birds of a feather, right?

637
00:45:43,830 --> 00:45:45,800
Yes, it is.

638
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:49,660
 Prosecutor 

639
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:11,980
Doesn't the new girl suit Kim Se Won well? They're both gold spoons  (born into rich families). 

640
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:16,690
Of course, the son of a hospital director and the daughter of a fraud suspect being together

641
00:46:16,690 --> 00:46:18,940
doesn't make any sense.

642
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:24,370
Now that I look at it, you're really something.  The evidence wasn't sufficient to convict your father of fraud,

643
00:46:24,370 --> 00:46:29,640
and in the fallout of your ex boyfriend handling it with a nolle prosequi (not pursue prosecution), he was exiled to Chooncheon.

644
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,170
But how can you walk around so unashamedly? Man.

645
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:36,820
If it were me, I wouldn't be able to stay here.

646
00:46:36,820 --> 00:46:39,520
What is it that you want to say?

647
00:46:41,330 --> 00:46:43,790
That you can't hide your roots.

648
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:47,250
No matter how ambitious you get, you'll only be a mere prosecutor.

649
00:46:47,250 --> 00:46:51,340
Sure, because you know this, you are even more vigorous

650
00:46:51,340 --> 00:46:53,980
because you want to try to succeed, no matter how you do it.

651
00:46:55,290 --> 00:46:55,910
Please stop.

652
00:46:55,910 --> 00:46:59,320
Do you think the Chief Prosecutor gave you Im Yoon Hui's case

653
00:46:59,320 --> 00:47:05,800
because you are skilled? It's because there is a use for you as a woman.

654
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:12,620
If you know, then don't overdo.

655
00:47:29,150 --> 00:47:30,620
Do you want to wait in the car?

656
00:47:30,620 --> 00:47:34,360
No, I want to look around, too.

657
00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,270
As I told you, you can't enter the lawyer reception area with me.

658
00:47:48,270 --> 00:47:51,580
I know at least that much. too.

659
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:56,270
Are all people here waiting for their trial like Ms. Im Yoon Hui?

660
00:47:56,270 --> 00:47:57,860
It's not always like that.

661
00:47:57,860 --> 00:48:03,110
Some have received their verdict, some are currently on trial, and some are waiting for their trial.

662
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:10,220
It's already 2 PM. Hurry up and go.

663
00:48:10,220 --> 00:48:12,130
It's cold out. How about you wait in the car?

664
00:48:12,130 --> 00:48:14,560
Why? Are you worried about me?

665
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,310
Yes. I'm worried.

666
00:48:18,050 --> 00:48:21,320
If you catch a cold, I'm also losing.

667
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,910
Wait, why?

668
00:48:23,910 --> 00:48:26,500
If you catch a cold, less work will be done.

669
00:48:26,500 --> 00:48:29,260
Then, I would be burdened by even more work.

670
00:48:29,260 --> 00:48:31,690
And if I catch your cold—

671
00:48:31,690 --> 00:48:35,400
Wow, you are seriously going overboard.

672
00:48:37,360 --> 00:48:38,890
Are you happy now?

673
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:51,420
It's really cold out. Don't be stubborn.

674
00:48:51,420 --> 00:48:54,250
Look around cursorily and then wait in the car.

675
00:48:59,790 --> 00:49:05,070
What? Is he worrying about me?

676
00:49:05,070 --> 00:49:08,270
What, what, what is it?

677
00:49:13,800 --> 00:49:15,830
Ms. Im Yoon Hui.

678
00:49:15,830 --> 00:49:21,440
Can you explain what happened that day to me in detail?

679
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,950
It might be painful to remember that memory.

680
00:49:24,950 --> 00:49:30,520
However, I need you to tell me truthfully what happened that day, without leaving out a single detail.

681
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:37,900
Are you unable to acknowledge the charge against you for the murder of your husband?

682
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:46,760
Are you reflecting over what you did?

683
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:52,760
I completely understand  the fact that you were abused by your husband

684
00:49:52,760 --> 00:49:54,900
for several years.

685
00:49:54,900 --> 00:49:59,480
However, even as a victim of domestic violence,

686
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:01,200
murder cannot be justified.

687
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,800
Then...

688
00:50:04,850 --> 00:50:07,670
What should I have done?

689
00:50:10,460 --> 00:50:13,010
Should I have died?

690
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:24,000
 Documentary Evidence 

691
00:50:24,000 --> 00:50:27,190
No matter how I look at it, it looks like self-defense.

692
00:50:37,110 --> 00:50:40,330
How is it now that you've met her? It's self-defense, right?

693
00:50:40,330 --> 00:50:43,520
It doesn't seem like a straightforward matter.

694
00:50:47,870 --> 00:50:52,340
Now that you've met her, it seems you are even more confused.

695
00:50:55,660 --> 00:50:59,940
Then, while you drive, I will read this even more intensely.

696
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:03,120
If I read it meticulously, I might find a breakthrough.

697
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,140
Please believe in me!

698
00:51:05,140 --> 00:51:06,940
Yes.

699
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:12,360
♫  Left home, out on my own  ♫

700
00:51:12,360 --> 00:51:16,940
♫  Had to leave cause I had no choice  ♫

701
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:19,630
She said she was going to find a breakthrough. 
 ♫  Kept going  ♫

702
00:51:20,210 --> 00:51:25,560
♫  To find what I've lost through the years  ♫

703
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:29,540
♫  Through all the noise, yeah  ♫

704
00:51:39,490 --> 00:51:42,000
♫  I see clear  ♫

705
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:45,330
♫  Naming lights is the life I live  ♫

706
00:51:45,330 --> 00:51:50,540
♫  Sing my song for a thousand loud  ♫

707
00:51:54,320 --> 00:51:59,530
For a while, I was thinking and I guess I fell asleep.

708
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:02,160
Why didn't you wake me up when we got here?

709
00:52:02,160 --> 00:52:04,400
Because you were sleeping so deeply that I would have felt sorry for waking you up.

710
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,300
- Did you wait a long time? 
 - No.

711
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:14,320
Did I make a mistake while I was sleeping?

712
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,290
I don't know if I can call this a mistake.

713
00:52:18,290 --> 00:52:21,050
But, you snored. A lot.

714
00:52:21,050 --> 00:52:23,040
Me? Oh Yoon Seo?

715
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:26,970
Wow, that's impossible. I don't snore.

716
00:52:27,810 --> 00:52:29,640
It's a joke.

717
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:34,050
What kind of joke is this when it's not even funny?

718
00:52:34,050 --> 00:52:36,600
But, is it that detrimental if you snore?

719
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:41,250
Of course. I only wanted to show you my pretty and good side—

720
00:52:44,980 --> 00:52:47,090
To me?

721
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:51,250
Yes. Because...

722
00:52:52,390 --> 00:52:55,960
Because you are stricter than anyone else.

723
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:59,810
If I don't do that, you might see my flaws.

724
00:53:04,870 --> 00:53:07,190
You've worked hard today.

725
00:53:10,660 --> 00:53:12,800
Go home safely.

726
00:53:22,480 --> 00:53:26,440
I'm crazy, crazy! How could I say that there? Am I crazy?

727
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,710
Yes, Office Manager. Yes.

728
00:53:39,410 --> 00:53:41,750
There is something urgent I need to find out.

729
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:46,350
Im Yoon Hui's mother left home early because of domestic violence by her father.

730
00:53:46,350 --> 00:53:52,100
So, she was living with her father. Since ten years ago, there is no way to verify whether her father is dead or alive.

731
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,470
Her father disappeared ten years ago.

732
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:57,390
Then, he is already considered dead.

733
00:53:57,390 --> 00:53:59,310
That's right.

734
00:53:59,310 --> 00:54:04,000
Her mother left home and her father is considered dead.

735
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:07,190
Her ex-husband died by fire.

736
00:54:07,190 --> 00:54:09,630
And her new husband...

737
00:54:11,330 --> 00:54:13,680
She has such a cursed fate.

738
00:54:13,680 --> 00:54:15,730
That's right.

739
00:54:16,900 --> 00:54:21,680
After she graduated from high school, she worked in markets, in retail stores, etc.

740
00:54:21,680 --> 00:54:24,690
She lived while doing those kind of jobs.

741
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,720
She also worked in the insurance field.

742
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:30,100
Did you say insurance?

743
00:54:34,010 --> 00:54:36,930
Do you think this case can be resolved?

744
00:54:36,930 --> 00:54:40,230
I don't know. Whether it was an unintentional accident,

745
00:54:40,230 --> 00:54:44,050
or an insurance fraud to get money will become the crucial point, I think.

746
00:54:44,050 --> 00:54:47,470
Because Im Yoon Hui worked in the insurance field, they will be even more suspicious.

747
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:50,010
But, about Im Yoon Hui,

748
00:54:50,010 --> 00:54:54,360
I did some research and her ex-husband also has a violent assault record.

749
00:54:54,360 --> 00:54:59,380
Why did she marry  again with such a violent man?

750
00:54:59,380 --> 00:55:01,850
If she underwent it once, she would know how to avoid it.

751
00:55:01,850 --> 00:55:04,930
I was a psychologist for one of my dramas.

752
00:55:04,930 --> 00:55:06,980
Some women, even if they are assaulted by their husband,

753
00:55:06,980 --> 00:55:11,350
will repeatedly forgive the husband if he begs for forgiveness.

754
00:55:11,350 --> 00:55:15,420
They say it's a psychological problem.

755
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:19,060
I have applied for an evaluation of Im Yoon Hui's psychological status.

756
00:55:21,930 --> 00:55:24,060
 Yoo Yeo Reum 

757
00:55:26,250 --> 00:55:28,730
It's quite unexpected.

758
00:55:28,730 --> 00:55:31,790
You know how difficult this case is for me.

759
00:55:31,790 --> 00:55:33,820
Why are you standing across the court room aisle from me?

760
00:55:33,820 --> 00:55:38,160
It's against the ethics of lawyers to reject a case where the client requested you.

761
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:41,630
If we need to consider the content of the case, the weight of the case,  who knows whom at court,

762
00:55:41,630 --> 00:55:43,270
then no case would be accepted.

763
00:55:43,270 --> 00:55:46,680
I know, but you should've known, too.

764
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:51,620
No murder case in the court has ever been acknowledged as self-defense.

765
00:55:52,420 --> 00:55:54,860
That's not important.

766
00:55:54,860 --> 00:55:57,380
At any rate, I will reveal the truth of this case as best as I can.

767
00:55:57,380 --> 00:55:59,950
If she is guilty, then she will receive the punishment she deserves.

768
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:04,300
If she is not guilty, then I will make sure she receives a non-guilty verdict.  Because that's my role.

769
00:56:04,300 --> 00:56:07,660
She will not obtain a non-guilty verdict

770
00:56:07,660 --> 00:56:10,230
because that's my role.

771
00:56:12,520 --> 00:56:15,230
 Today is the first trial hearing for  Im Yoon Hui. 

772
00:56:15,230 --> 00:56:17,570
 The prosecutor is arguing that 

773
00:56:17,570 --> 00:56:20,700
 Ms. Im, who is known to have accidentally killed her husband, actually  premeditated murdering her husband. 

774
00:56:20,700 --> 00:56:23,760
 Thus, she was charged with murder rather than unintentional homicide.  

775
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:28,250
The defendant, Im Yoon Hui, and the victim, Kim Hyung Tae, were a legally married couple.

776
00:56:28,250 --> 00:56:30,780
On January 21st 2019, in their home,

777
00:56:30,780 --> 00:56:33,340
while the victim was being assaulted by Kim Hyeong Tae,

778
00:56:33,340 --> 00:56:36,230
she threatened Kim Hyeong Tae with a knife she took from the kitchen.

779
00:56:36,230 --> 00:56:41,030
She stabbed him once in his abdomen and once in chest thus murdering him.

780
00:56:41,660 --> 00:56:45,110
The deceased, Kim Hyeong Tae, was a repeat domestic abuser.

781
00:56:45,110 --> 00:56:50,090
It might seem like self-defense from the defendant who couldn't withstand her husband's abuse anymore.

782
00:56:50,090 --> 00:56:52,940
However, if you look at the submitted autopsy report,

783
00:56:52,940 --> 00:56:57,440
it is a murder committed with obvious intent.

784
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:05,300
What is the probability that the knife accurately hit those locations by chance?

785
00:57:05,360 --> 00:57:10,170
Thus, I, as the prosecutor, charge the defendant Ms. Im Yoon Hui with murder.

786
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:18,770
Lawyer, please give your statement on the charge.

787
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:23,810
According to the emergency services dispatched at that time,

788
00:57:23,810 --> 00:57:27,360
the defendant, Im Yoon Hui, had two fractured ribs

789
00:57:27,360 --> 00:57:30,240
that were severely broken nine weeks ago.

790
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,340
If we assume that it was premeditated,

791
00:57:32,340 --> 00:57:36,000
from a woman who has fractured ribs from nine weeks earlier,

792
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:42,400
what is the probability that she can accurately stab those locations?

793
00:57:43,830 --> 00:57:48,720
Therefore, as her lawyer, I ask that you give her a not guilty verdict as it was self-defense.

794
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:53,740
At that moment, in order to survive,

795
00:57:53,740 --> 00:57:56,360
aside from her will to live,

796
00:57:56,360 --> 00:58:00,460
there was no intention nor plan to murder.

797
00:58:02,490 --> 00:58:06,680
Defendant, your mother left home when you were ten years old.

798
00:58:06,680 --> 00:58:08,780
What is the reason?

799
00:58:09,480 --> 00:58:12,240
She was being hit by my drunk father.

800
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,550
Her head hit the floor

801
00:58:14,550 --> 00:58:16,830
and bled a lot.

802
00:58:17,420 --> 00:58:21,060
While my father was looking for something to hit my mother with,

803
00:58:21,060 --> 00:58:23,300
she ran away.

804
00:58:24,200 --> 00:58:26,670
Because she wanted to live.

805
00:58:34,580 --> 00:58:39,690
I heard that your father began abusing you after that, as well.

806
00:58:39,740 --> 00:58:41,990
Is that correct?

807
00:58:41,990 --> 00:58:44,570
Yes, it is.

808
00:58:45,620 --> 00:58:50,570
Her ex-husband, as well as the late Kim Hyeong Tae, were both violent people.

809
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:53,970
You must have remembered how hard it was to endure your father's abuse.

810
00:58:53,970 --> 00:58:59,090
Why, of all people, did you meet with people who were violent like your father?

811
00:59:03,220 --> 00:59:09,810
Your Honor, in order to help understand the victim's situation, I am calling a psychologist to the witness stand.

812
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:12,850
If you think about it, at first it will be hard to comprehend.

813
00:59:12,890 --> 00:59:15,480
But if you live in a certain situation for a long time,

814
00:59:15,480 --> 00:59:17,730
you build a tendency to think of it as the way things are supposed to be.

815
00:59:17,730 --> 00:59:20,060
Could you please speak a little more specifically?

816
00:59:20,060 --> 00:59:22,480
In the case of a child who was abused from childhood,

817
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,050
they can't discern that the abuse is wrong.

818
00:59:26,090 --> 00:59:28,550
And at some point, they learn that it is to be expected.

819
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,960
And if that same kind of environment is not maintained,

820
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,770
they feel psychologically uneasy and eventually repeat the vicious cycle.

821
00:59:35,770 --> 00:59:40,560
If we look at the psychological evaluation written by the expert witness,

822
00:59:40,560 --> 00:59:45,750
when the subject has been exposed to years of abuse since childhood,

823
00:59:45,750 --> 00:59:50,510
one cannot see any possibility that she would have an intact ability to discriminate.

824
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:53,020
You wrote that.  Is  that correct?

825
00:59:53,020 --> 00:59:54,800
Yes. That was our conclusion.

826
00:59:54,850 --> 00:59:58,830
In other words, as a result of her  inability to discriminate, at the time of the crime in this case,

827
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:02,820
the mental status of the defendant Im Yoon Hui can be seen to be impaired.

828
01:00:02,820 --> 01:00:05,820
Do you agree with this interpretation?

829
01:00:05,820 --> 01:00:07,280
Yes.

830
01:00:08,430 --> 01:00:10,300
That is all.

831
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:15,240
Prosecutor, will you question again?

832
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,060
Yes.

833
01:00:17,060 --> 01:00:19,010
Im Yoon Hui,

834
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:21,770
There were claims on the life insurance policy of your prior husband who died by fire

835
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:26,960
and on your father who disappeared ten years earlier.

836
01:00:29,950 --> 01:00:33,140
Is it true that you personally made those claims?

837
01:00:33,140 --> 01:00:34,780
Yes, that is correct.

838
01:00:34,780 --> 01:00:39,840
You were aware that the late Kim Hyeong Tae was also insured, correct?

839
01:00:39,840 --> 01:00:40,760
Yes.

840
01:00:40,760 --> 01:00:43,070
Do you know how much it was for, as well?

841
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,370
I don't know.

842
01:00:44,500 --> 01:00:51,400
The total value of all the life insurance insuring Kim Hyeong Tae was 4.94 billion won.

843
01:00:57,870 --> 01:01:01,780
That is a pretty large amount for you to claim you didn't know.

844
01:01:05,780 --> 01:01:07,640
That will be all.

845
01:01:14,210 --> 01:01:16,090
Are you pleading that she may have a mental disorder?

846
01:01:16,090 --> 01:01:18,410
Anyway, well, even if you can't get it acknowledged as self-defense,

847
01:01:18,410 --> 01:01:21,500
if you can pretend she's a victim who has been wronged and have her sentence reduced

848
01:01:21,500 --> 01:01:24,640
by stating that she has a mental disorder, then there's nothing for you to lose from a lawyer's standpoint.

849
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:26,540
Don't speak like that.

850
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:33,380
Self defense and mental disorder are all legal principles in the Criminal Code.

851
01:01:33,380 --> 01:01:36,500
If she gets acknowledged as having a possible mental disorder, I won't just stand still.

852
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:38,270
So don't relax unnecessarily

853
01:01:38,270 --> 01:01:42,950
because this isn't a case that you can win.

854
01:01:58,380 --> 01:02:02,020
Why are you so obsessed with Im Yoon Hui's case?

855
01:02:02,020 --> 01:02:05,080
Because this is the only way.

856
01:02:07,240 --> 01:02:12,030
You've been in a high position ever since you were born. You could never understand how I feel.

857
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,820
You're here?

858
01:02:22,820 --> 01:02:24,880
- You're here?
 - I'm back.

859
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:27,930
Um... What about Lawyer Kwon?

860
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:32,060
Ah. He said that he was going to talk with the prosecutor in charge of the case,

861
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:33,800
so he told me to come back here first.

862
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:37,100
What happened with the trial today? A ton of articles came out.

863
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:42,120
Since your facial expression doesn't look to good, did we come out at a disadvantage?

864
01:02:42,120 --> 01:02:49,010
Yes. The atmosphere was alright even after Mr. Lawyer pleaded that Im Yoon Hui may have a mental disorder,

865
01:02:49,010 --> 01:02:53,500
but when there was talk of how much insurance money she would receive from her husband's death,

866
01:02:53,500 --> 01:02:56,070
the mood leaned toward that side a lot.

867
01:02:56,070 --> 01:02:59,020
Just how much was the insurance money from his death?

868
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:01,690
4.94 billion won.

869
01:03:01,740 --> 01:03:05,540
4.94 billion?  I'm sure that would disturb people.

870
01:03:05,540 --> 01:03:10,040
Right? I also am suddenly suspecting that she did it because of the money, too.

871
01:03:10,090 --> 01:03:12,900
Wow, what will our Lawyer Kwon do?

872
01:03:12,900 --> 01:03:15,790
This case is a big issue in the news right now,

873
01:03:15,790 --> 01:03:18,790
so if he loses the case, he'll become a huge target.

874
01:03:18,790 --> 01:03:22,820
The verdict hasn't even come out yet, so why are you speaking like that?

875
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,050
Mr. Lawyer.

876
01:03:26,130 --> 01:03:28,240
I'm back.

877
01:03:42,380 --> 01:03:46,260
Um... Mr. Lawyer.

878
01:03:49,330 --> 01:03:52,780
Don't worry too much about what people say.

879
01:03:52,780 --> 01:03:54,540
I'm not worried about it,

880
01:03:54,540 --> 01:03:58,970
because when you look at today's results, anyone could think that way.

881
01:03:59,020 --> 01:04:00,990
Yes.

882
01:04:00,990 --> 01:04:05,990
But, I think that you'll win the case.

883
01:04:05,990 --> 01:04:14,220
Honestly, I thought that a lawyer's job only suited stern and logical people,

884
01:04:14,250 --> 01:04:19,000
but I think you can only do it if you're warm-hearted,

885
01:04:19,000 --> 01:04:21,470
like you, Mr. Lawyer.

886
01:04:21,470 --> 01:04:28,070
Mr. Lawyer, you're unexpectedly warm-hearted and very considerate.

887
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:36,200
There was also a time when I felt like I was the only one in the world and felt so lonely in the past,

888
01:04:36,200 --> 01:04:40,590
and there was no one who took my side back then.

889
01:04:40,590 --> 01:04:43,490
I was at such a loss.

890
01:04:43,540 --> 01:04:49,520
But if there had been a person like you by my side back then,

891
01:04:49,600 --> 01:04:53,980
how nice would it have been? I've been thinking that.

892
01:04:53,980 --> 01:04:57,200
Because you're such a great lawyer,

893
01:04:57,220 --> 01:05:01,760
I believe that you will also resolve this case.

894
01:05:24,820 --> 01:05:27,770
It's already this late.

895
01:05:33,650 --> 01:05:36,150
Why haven't you gotten off work yet?

896
01:05:36,210 --> 01:05:41,410
Ah... I was looking at some files related to self-defense

897
01:05:41,410 --> 01:05:44,850
because I was wondering what I could do to be of some help.

898
01:05:44,900 --> 01:05:47,990
Will you eat dinner with me?

899
01:05:50,020 --> 01:05:52,820
Yes. I was actually really hungry.

900
01:05:52,820 --> 01:05:55,070
Then let's go.

901
01:06:01,790 --> 01:06:04,590
To be honest,

902
01:06:04,620 --> 01:06:08,180
the reason that I became a lawyer

903
01:06:08,180 --> 01:06:12,830
was because I wanted to be a person who stood by someone's side rather than a person who punishes them.

904
01:06:14,420 --> 01:06:16,800
Oh.

905
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:21,960
But why did you say that it's because you make a lot of money back then?

906
01:06:23,100 --> 01:06:27,500
Because it was somewhat embarrassing to speak honestly back then.

907
01:06:28,450 --> 01:06:34,620
Then, why are you speaking honestly now?

908
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:46,690
Because now, I heard what you said and wanted to tell you for some reason.

909
01:06:47,430 --> 01:06:52,670
I was thankful when you said that you believe in me earlier.

910
01:06:52,670 --> 01:06:59,760
And also, if the time comes when you feel so lonely that  it's as if you're the only one in the world,

911
01:06:59,810 --> 01:07:04,470
and if you feel at a loss because you don't have anyone to stand by your side,

912
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:10,250
I will stand by your side at that time.

913
01:07:20,450 --> 01:07:22,610
♫   Full of something I don't know  ♫

914
01:07:22,610 --> 01:07:24,060
Mr. Lawyer!

915
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:29,920
♫  Honestly, it's hard for me umm  ♫

916
01:07:29,920 --> 01:07:33,370
♫  Whether timing is what it is or  ♫

917
01:07:33,370 --> 01:07:36,420
♫  Why did it get twisted as it pleased?  ♫

918
01:07:36,460 --> 01:07:39,370
I have something to tell you.

919

♫  My slow moving heart  ♫

920
01:07:42,250 --> 01:07:43,180

♫  Searched for you with all my might  ♫

922

I don't want to tell you right now.

925
01:08:07,840 --> 01:08:10,650

01:09:06,040 --> 01:09:08,780
  A modern working woman. You look like a workaholic. 

940
01:09:08,780 --> 01:09:10,800
 You're totally sexy. 

941
01:09:10,800 --> 01:09:12,470
 Aren't you working my Yoon Seo too much? 

942
01:09:12,470 --> 01:09:14,280

 Shall I make you a cup of coffee?

 Wasn't I warned not to overwork you yesterday? 

947
01:09:20,510 --> 01:09:21,770
 By your boyfriend. 

948
01:09:21,770 --> 01:09:23,510
 You've never dated, have you? 

949
01:09:23,510 --> 01:09:26,660
 Because you seem to be so bad at it. 

950
01:09:26,660 --> 01:09:29,370
 Someone said that I would definitely win the case. 

951
01:09:29,370 --> 01:09:31,510
 So, please believe in me until the end and wait. 

952
01:09:31,510 --> 01:09:33,370
 We're stepping into uncharted territory. 

953
01:09:33,370 --> 01:09:35,850
 She could possibly be the only witness of this case, 

954
01:09:35,850 --> 01:09:37,930
 or there could be another suspect.

♫  What should I do? What if love?  ♫
