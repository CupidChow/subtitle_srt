1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:05,080


2
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:40,760
 Touch Your Heart 

3
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,200
Oh, what's the matter?

4
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:47,800
The thing is, I thought I should tell you first.

5
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,590
The arrest warrant for Jeong Ji Ho and Lee Kang Joon will proceed tomorrow morning.

6
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:55,410
Like you said, Jeong Ji Ho's gambling charge is fake.

7
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:57,470
What do you mean?

8
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:01,250
I traced Lawyer Choi Yeon Soo's contingent fee of ‎₩5 billion.

9
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,380
It came from the headquarters of a paper company in Macao.

10
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:07,310
And the real owner of it is Lee Kang Joon.

11
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:11,090
So, it means that they were washing their slush funds through the account.

12
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:14,710
- Is that why they met in Macao? 
 - Yes.

13
00:01:14,710 --> 00:01:19,480
The prosecutor found out, so they decided to cover it up  wtih a gambling charge

14
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:22,670
since gambling is a much less serious charge in comparison.

15
00:01:22,670 --> 00:01:25,380
I'll tell you the details at home. I'll be home soon.

16
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,050
Sure. I'll see you later.

17
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,370
You're here?

18
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:25,890
 The person you are trying to call cannot answer the phone at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep. 

19
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:55,990
Tell me honestly now! Tell me you love me!

20
00:02:55,990 --> 00:02:59,980
Tell me you only have me and that you won't betray me again!

21
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:24,320
Don't touch my woman.

22
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:30,670
 Episode 12  
What happened?

23
00:03:30,670 --> 00:03:33,970
Aigoo, you can't come to your senses.

24
00:03:33,970 --> 00:03:36,200
-  What kind of case is this?  
 -  Isn't that Lee Kang Joon? 

25
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:40,450
Please hand him over to the Seoul Western District Prosecutors' Office. He is suspected of drug use.

26
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,470
Yes, I understand.

27
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:46,180
Is Yoon Seo alright?

28
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:50,770
Her cousin will come soon. Until then, I will stay with her.

29
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:54,020
I will write the victim's testimony on behalf of her as her lawyer.

30
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:56,390
Sure. I'll head to the prosecutors office first.

31
00:03:56,390 --> 00:03:58,400
Work hard.

32
00:03:59,540 --> 00:04:03,560
-  What happened? 
 -  What's the matter? 

33
00:04:28,370 --> 00:04:32,000
You can truly be at peace now.

34
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:37,210
He will never appear in front of you again.

35
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:51,810
 This is breaking news. This morning, the Seoul Central District Court's judge 

36
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:56,290
 has issued an arrest warrant for Imperial Group's Vice-President Lee Kang Joon. 

37
00:04:56,290 --> 00:05:00,720
 Vice-President Lee Kang Joon set up a slush fund by embezzling from the company. 

38
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,950
 On top of that, he  is also charged with billions of won in tax evasion. 

39
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:09,470
 Natural Diet CEO's Jeong Ji Ho has additional charges of being an accomplice in tax evasion and embezzlement. 

40
00:05:09,470 --> 00:05:11,820
 It is anticipated that he will be investigated soon. 

41
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,740
 Imperial Holdings Vice-President Lee Kang Joon under the influence of drugs 

42
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,050
 trespassed into Oh Yoon Seo's home yesterday evening. 

43
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:21,570
 He is being investigated for endangering Ms. Oh and destroying property.  

44
00:05:21,570 --> 00:05:24,910
 From the reports thus far, Mr. Lee will undergo— 

45
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:27,520
Oh, this is so refreshing! So refreshing!

46
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:31,630
Drugs, stalking, evasion of taxes to embezzlement.

47
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:34,760
He's total human trash, nuclear waste!

48
00:05:34,760 --> 00:05:39,000
When I think about how this trash bastard was bothering Yoon Seo all that time,

49
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,040
CEO, even now, I'm still...

50
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:50,580
People didn't even know the whole story, yet they Yoon Seo in with that disgusting person and cursed her.

51
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,760
They know now since this case has been resolved cleanly.

52
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,290
CEO, you worked hard. CEO!

53
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,770
You didn't wash your hair?

54
00:06:02,770 --> 00:06:06,030
I'm sorry. I wasn't in my right state of mind.

55
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:09,620
Oh, hey! What happened to Yoon Seo? Can she go out alone?

56
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,010
Yoon Seo is taking it better than I thought.

57
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:16,370
It feels like she has gotten a lot stronger recently. She even said she was going back to work.

58
00:06:16,370 --> 00:06:18,470
She's going to work?

59
00:06:18,470 --> 00:06:20,680
The drama is not happening anymore. Why is she going to work?

60
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:25,260
She said that there is only a week left, so she wants to wrap it up nicely.

61
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:34,700
Hello.

62
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:37,580
Yoon Seo, you were having a hard time all that time, right?

63
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:41,500
We saw the news and the articles. They said that you were being stalked this whole time.

64
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,230
Why didn't you tell us in the beginning?

65
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:46,430
Whether it's by the law or by the fist,

66
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:50,230
we would've resolved this for you without hesitation.

67
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,910
Since you were always bright and strong,

68
00:06:52,910 --> 00:06:56,370
we could've never even imagined that you were undergoing that.

69
00:06:57,860 --> 00:07:00,650
Thank you, everyone, for worrying about me.

70
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:05,170
It's natural that we're worried. We're just like family now.

71
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:08,360
But, why are you here today?

72
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:12,250
We heard that you wouldn't be coming for a while.

73
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:15,870
Who said I wouldn't come? There isn't much time left in my contract.

74
00:07:15,870 --> 00:07:18,230
For the remaining time, I should work harder.

75
00:07:18,230 --> 00:07:22,030
Still, you should've rested for today.

76
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,860
No, I'm really fine. Don't worry.

77
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:46,120
Th-This.

78
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,530
What is this?

79
00:07:47,530 --> 00:07:52,620
In the comments on your articles. I picked out the good comments.

80
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:57,710
Among them, I highlighted the most positive ones with a highlighter.

81
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,150
In the past, there were many bad comments that I wanted to sue over, right away.

82
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,440
However, today, there are many comments sincerely encouraging you.

83
00:08:08,440 --> 00:08:11,320
So, read these and brighten your mood up.

84
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:13,830
Ah, this

85
00:08:15,090 --> 00:08:18,590
Have you seen this article as well?

86
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:23,230
It's an article about all the hardships you went through.

87
00:08:23,230 --> 00:08:25,580
All the comments here are also positive.

88
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:27,600
Oh, wait a minute.

89
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,990
 Let's reflect until the day Oh Yoon Seo comes back. 
  Imagine how suffocating and unfair it must've felt for her. Come back Oh Yoon Seo.  

90
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:33,360
Mr. Lawyer, you pressed like on those comments every day?

91
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:35,100
Yes, well.

92
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:46,620
Thank you, Mr. Lawyer.

93
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:52,260
I'm more thankful that you endured through those hard times well.

94
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:38,730
 Hashtags such as #ComeBackOhYoonSeo and #WeAreSorryOhYoonSeo are trending on community boards. 

95
00:09:57,530 --> 00:10:00,030
The weather has gotten a lot warmer.

96
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:02,080
That's right.

97
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,960
Why are you looking at me like that?

98
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:11,720
I know!

99
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:14,340
"Are you really okay?"

100
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,390
That's what you were going to say.

101
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:19,960
I'm really fine.

102
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:22,590
Now, everything is really over.

103
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:27,270
And next to me, there is you who care so much about me.

104
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:30,220
What would I be worried—

105
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:35,810
There's one thing left that I should worry about.

106
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:38,000
Pardon? About what?

107
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:42,420
I'm hungry. What should we go get to eat?

108
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,890
Ah, I'm telling you I'm hungry.

109
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:49,310
- What are you going to eat?
 - Hey, isn't that Oh Yoon Seo?
 - I think it is.

110
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:51,860
Excuse me. Aren't you Oh Yoon Seo?

111
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:54,390
Ah, I'm not.

112
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:55,800
Hey, it is you!

113
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,540
Even your voice totally sounds like Oh Yoon Seo.

114
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:59,470
Noona, I'm a huge fan of yours.

115
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:00,760
Can you give me your autograph?

116
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,290
Excuse me, Yoon Seo. I saw the articles. Good luck!

117
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:05,770
I have believed you from the beginning.  You're so very beautiful.

118
00:11:05,770 --> 00:11:08,790
Unni, I'm a serious fan of yours. Can I take a picture of you?

119
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:11,670
Wait, wait, wait. Everyone, you can't take pictures.

120
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,640
Of course, I understand how you feel, but Oh Jin S—

121
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:17,830
As much as Yoon Seo is recognized,

122
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:21,090
if the pictures taken of her today spread around on social media, it can cause several legal problems.

123
00:11:21,090 --> 00:11:24,080
I understand how you all feel, but please refrain from taking pictures.

124
00:11:24,080 --> 00:11:25,760
If you take pictures without the other party's consent,

125
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:27,700
the legal liability for the violation of the portraiture right naturally...

126
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:30,520
- Who are you?
 - What?

127
00:11:31,710 --> 00:11:35,690
Uh... I'm just her male friend. A male friend.

128
00:11:35,690 --> 00:11:37,930
And here I thought that you were Oh Yoon Seo's boyfriend.

129
00:11:37,930 --> 00:11:40,060
I thought you were her lawyer.

130
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:44,070
- What's your name?
 - It's Kim Min Hoo.

131
00:11:44,070 --> 00:11:47,780
- Please wait your turn.
 - Kim Min Hoo.

132
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:52,030
If she falls over from you pushing her, you will have to take legal responsibility.

133
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:57,250
Please give me one shrimp sandwich, one chicken sandwich, and two cups of Americano.

134
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:03,750
It's been a really long time since I was surrounded by people

135
00:12:03,750 --> 00:12:05,410
wanting my autograph.

136
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:08,280
The comments and the people seem to feel favorable toward me,

137
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:11,530
so it feels like I've gone back to the past. I really love it.

138
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:16,480
Ah, then did I step in unnecessarily earlier?

139
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,540
No, I liked it.

140
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:22,030
Honestly, it's a bit burdensome to have pictures filmed of me.

141
00:12:22,030 --> 00:12:26,770
And since you stepped forward like that,  I also felt reassured.

142
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:30,980
Why are you laughing like that all of a sudden?

143
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:36,220
Nothing. I just thought of when you called yourself my male friend earlier.

144
00:12:36,220 --> 00:12:39,500
Where did you learn an acronym like that?
 (nam-sa-chin, an acronym meaning "male friend" in Korean) 

145
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:44,190
Why are you asking me that? I'm also a trendy person who knows that much.

146
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:47,480
Oh, really?

147
00:12:47,480 --> 00:12:53,530
Then, what does "gab-boon-ssa" mean?

148
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,320
Gap boon ssa?
 (An acronym for suddenly ruining the mood in Korean) 

149
00:12:57,320 --> 00:13:03,740
When a superior (gap) and an inferior have a dispute (boon), a fight (ssa) arises.

150
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,850
- Alright then, what about haek-in-ssa?
 - What?

151
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:09,480
Haek in ssa.
 (Korean acronym for super popular) 

152
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,870
Let's take core (haek) lectures

153
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:16,920
on the internet (in) cheaply (ssa).

154
00:13:42,270 --> 00:13:46,790
I guess Lawyer Dan hasn't gotten off work yet, either.

155
00:13:46,790 --> 00:13:51,590
 What are you going to do if you can't hold back? 

156
00:13:51,590 --> 00:13:55,160
 I'm sorry. So why did you step in and— 

157
00:13:55,160 --> 00:14:01,540
 It's your birthday. I couldn't let you get hit in the head on your birthday. 

158
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,730
  I, Choi Yoon Hyeok, am a man like a rose. 

159
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,780
 I'm a deadly man that looks flashy and beautiful but has thorns. 

160
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:22,540
 I was looking for a woman 

161
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:27,730
 who could embrace my rose-like self like this vase. 

162
00:14:27,730 --> 00:14:31,410
 She even got her hair pulled in order to protect me. 

163
00:14:31,410 --> 00:14:34,620
 What should I do with a woman like you, 

164
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,090
 who is strong like a vase? 

165
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,510
What's with him?

166
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:57,930
What's this? It seems like he was stealing looks at me.

167
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:02,140
What do I mean, stealing looks at me? Let's not misunderstand.

168
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:05,480
I made my mind up not to waste my time.

169
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,990
Lawyer Dan.

170
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:29,960
Excuse me. That is, so...

171
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:34,990
Let's have a glass of alcohol today, or not.

172
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:42,240
What do you...? Are you asking me to have a glass of alcohol with you or not to?

173
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:48,190
Let's have a glass of alcohol. Right away. Right now.

174
00:16:04,700 --> 00:16:07,250
Why is there so much of this?

175
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:29,180
I did it because you don't like boning fish.

176
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:40,850
 I've met a lot of women who put foundation on their face to impress me, 

177
00:16:40,850 --> 00:16:45,060
 but she's the first woman to bone a fish to give to me. 

178
00:16:45,060 --> 00:16:47,810
 What should I do with you? 

179
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:58,240
- Lawyer Dan, is there anyone that you like these days?
 - What?

180
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:01,640
No, your heart is a hard-working workaholic

181
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:04,370
that pounds hard for 365 days a year.

182
00:17:04,370 --> 00:17:08,420
But these days, it seems like that heart has quieted down.

183
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:15,180
Honestly, there was someone that I liked recently,

184
00:17:15,180 --> 00:17:17,360
but I decided to give up on him.

185
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:20,860
That person doesn't have feelings for me, so no matter how much I like him by myself,

186
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:22,860
what good will it do?

187
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:31,090
Can I ask you who that person is?

188
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:38,970
That is... If you ask me who it is...

189
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,930
Yes. Who is—

190
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:45,860
I think you're drunk, so let's get up.

191
00:17:50,390 --> 00:17:54,010
 I've seen women stop overly taking care for their skin to impress me, 

192
00:17:54,010 --> 00:17:57,040
 but she's the first woman to cut me off while I'm speaking. 

193
00:18:03,470 --> 00:18:06,640
 What should I do with a woman like you, 

194
00:18:06,640 --> 00:18:09,590
 who is as potent as this alcohol mix? 

195
00:18:11,070 --> 00:18:13,280
Lawyer Dan, wait for me!

196
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,860
I was going to pay.

197
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:23,560
We're here.

198
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:27,050
But now, there really is only a week left

199
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:29,410
for me to take you home like this.

200
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:32,940
That's right.

201
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,150
Even if my time working at the law firm ends, our relationship won't change.

202
00:18:37,150 --> 00:18:42,250
But still, when I think that we won't be able to be together as much as we are now,

203
00:18:42,250 --> 00:18:44,560
I feel a little sad.

204
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:50,160
Let's have fun for the rest of our time.

205
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:04,100
Oh no!

206
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,180
Uh... No, that's... Oppa...

207
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:18,170
At this hour... Why are you here?

208
00:19:18,170 --> 00:19:23,330
Yoon Seo. Are you dating that lawyer?

209
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:33,390
Yeah. I'm dating him.

210
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:40,580
No. Yoon Seo, talk with me for a second.

211
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:42,740
Mr. Lawyer, be safe on your way

212
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,730
and call me before you go to sleep. Call me.

213
00:19:45,730 --> 00:19:47,580
Alright, I will.

214
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,610
Seriously, come here!

215
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,230
How in the world did this happen?

216
00:20:02,230 --> 00:20:06,630
Wait, you hated Kwon Jeong Rok. But now, why are you...

217
00:20:06,630 --> 00:20:08,400
Why are you going out with Kwon Jeong Rok?

218
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:12,610
That's up to me. I'm this age, so why are you sticking your nose in my dating life?

219
00:20:12,610 --> 00:20:15,840
Hey, Yoon Seo. It's my job to stick my nose into your business. What can I do about it?

220
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:18,000
I have to stick my nose into every single thing that you do

221
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:22,180
and take care of you so that things go well for you. That's my job and my duty.

222
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:25,080
Alright, Yoon Seo. People are much more interested in you right now

223
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,520
than you think they are.

224
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:29,480
Hey, at times like this, we have to maintain your image even—

225
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:32,310
Oppa, I like Mr. Lawyer a lot.

226
00:20:32,310 --> 00:20:35,730
I really like him. I like him a ton.

227
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:38,800
So, don't say anything.

228
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:42,040
- Yoon Seo.
 - Oppa.

229
00:20:43,550 --> 00:20:49,010
D-Don't get caught. Don't get caught and do well, then.

230
00:20:53,630 --> 00:20:55,020
Ah, whatever.

231
00:20:55,020 --> 00:21:00,340
But, why are you here this late at night? It would have been nice if you hadn't come.

232
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:03,620
I was worried if you were alright

233
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:07,660
and came because I had something to tell you, but you look like you're doing really fine.

234
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:10,890
Well, what is it that you have to tell me? What?

235
00:21:10,890 --> 00:21:12,930
Writer Lee Sae Jin said she wanted to meet with you.

236
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:16,240
Writer Lee Sae Jin did? What's with that? Why does she?

237
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:18,920
I'm not sure. I don't know that, either.

238
00:21:22,990 --> 00:21:24,900
It's been a while, Yoon Seo.

239
00:21:24,900 --> 00:21:26,470
Yes.

240
00:21:26,470 --> 00:21:28,620
But what's going on?

241
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,390
Is there anything left to say after you canceled the drama?

242
00:21:31,390 --> 00:21:35,030
We're really sorry for doing that back then.

243
00:21:35,030 --> 00:21:38,710
We were really stressed because we weren't getting any investors,

244
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:41,970
so we let ourselves be momentarily blinded

245
00:21:41,970 --> 00:21:44,900
when we received that kind of proposal. I'm sorry.

246
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:48,260
Of course, you should be sorry! You're not playing games with someone.

247
00:21:48,260 --> 00:21:50,290
You tell someone to go to a law firm and gain some real-life experience

248
00:21:50,290 --> 00:21:53,080
and then treat them like a piece of trash? I was really displeased.

249
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,880
Please let go of your anger, Yoon Seo.

250
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:58,950
Honestly, I was touched by you, Yoon Seo.

251
00:21:58,950 --> 00:22:00,780
That the universe's goddess Oh Yoon Seo

252
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:05,380
would really go to a law firm and stay and work there for three months, on top of that...

253
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,680
I really couldn't even imagine it.

254
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:10,040
Because it seemed like you had that much affection for my drama,

255
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:13,730
I was truthfully suprised.

256
00:22:13,730 --> 00:22:15,910
I did have affection for it.

257
00:22:15,910 --> 00:22:19,360
Right? I knew it.

258
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:24,200
It's a bit awkward for me to say this, but I want you to be

259
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:27,260
my drama's female lead, Oh Yoon Seo.

260
00:22:28,730 --> 00:22:33,170
Actually, since they heard that Yoon Seo was going to be in the drama,

261
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,680
investors are pouring in like crazy.

262
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:38,240
A-A-Are you for real?

263
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,090
Yes. Because their misconceptions about Oh Yoon Seo were cleared,

264
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:45,360
everyone is viewing her favorably again. Because they heard that Yoon Seo will be coming back like that,

265
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,180
I think everyone is rushing in.

266
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:52,210
Goodness, why are they rushing in like that?

267
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:56,090
Anyway, we don't work with someone who was rude to us once.

268
00:22:56,090 --> 00:22:59,280
CEO, don't reject us in one stroke like that.

269
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,260
Whether it's one stroke or one pickled radish, we're not interested in this drama.
 ("In one stroke" and "radish" begin with the same syllable, "dan.") 

270
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:04,180
Right, Yoon Seo? We're not interested in this drama, right?

271
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:06,580
No, I want to do this drama.

272
00:23:06,580 --> 00:23:10,420
You heard that, right? She said that she wants to do this drama. Huh?

273
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:12,580
You said you  don't  want to do it?

274
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:16,160
- I said that I  want  to do it.
 - You want to do it?

275
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:22,000
Wait, why? Hey, do you have no sense of pride? Did I raise you that way?!

276
00:23:23,560 --> 00:23:27,310
Honestly, I was a little upset,

277
00:23:27,310 --> 00:23:30,590
but it seems like they couldn't do anything about it now that I've listened to them.

278
00:23:30,590 --> 00:23:35,400
And my affection for this drama grew as I was working in the law firm, you know!

279
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:39,260
Yoon Seo, don't be like that. Let's sign the contract right away.

280
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:41,080
Yoon Seo, you received the first part of the script, right?

281
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:43,560
I haven't shown anyone the next part yet,

282
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,670
but I'll go to my workshop and write it right away for you.

283
00:23:46,670 --> 00:23:50,120
Wait, aren't you allowing this too easily?

284
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,830
That's right, Yoon Seo. Let's think about it a little more.

285
00:23:52,830 --> 00:23:58,460
No. I'm going to do this drama. I'm confident that I can do well with the lawyer role.

286
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:06,180
Wow, you have no business skills, do you?

287
00:24:06,180 --> 00:24:09,610
Even if you were going to do it, you should have played hard to get a little more at that point.

288
00:24:09,610 --> 00:24:12,900
Well, I'm going to do it anyway, so what's the point of playing hard to get?

289
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:16,370
And what if I actually lost my chance while playing hard to get? What then?

290
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,910
Omo, look at this girl.

291
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:22,310
Yoon Seo, you're not the pitiful Yoon Seo from before anymore.

292
00:24:22,310 --> 00:24:25,330
You're not the Oh Yoon Seo who was crying her eyes out because she had no work, had no money coming in,

293
00:24:25,330 --> 00:24:28,010
and went around to this director and that director

294
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,330
pitifully begging them to give you just one role, any role. You're not that Oh Yoon Seo anymore, I'm telling you.

295
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,740
So forget all about that sucky period of time completely!

296
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:39,090
Even if I want to forget it, I can't because of you, Oppa.

297
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:45,830
Hey, speaking of that, the people at your law firm will be really surprised.

298
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,000
Well, those people think that you worked as a secretary because you couldn't make a living,

299
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:53,790
but when you suddenly appear on TV, they'll be so shocked.

300
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:59,880
But Oppa, if Mr. Lawyer finds out the truth,

301
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:01,830
will he be really disappointed?

302
00:25:01,830 --> 00:25:05,620
He'll probably feel betrayed because I was fooling him all this time, won't he?

303
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,490
Of course he will.

304
00:25:07,490 --> 00:25:10,460
He could even say that he can't date a woman that fools people like that

305
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:12,730
and ask to break up with you.

306
00:25:12,730 --> 00:25:16,730
So, how about you dump him first before you get dumped?

307
00:25:17,610 --> 00:25:21,400
No, I was just saying that. Why are you being so serious?

308
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:26,050
Of course, I'm serious. Wouldn't you be serious if it were you?

309
00:25:34,490 --> 00:25:38,560
 Mr. Lawyer, please make some time for me this evening. 

310
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:42,350
 I have something I must tell you before it gets too late. 

311
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:46,830
What shall we go eat?

312
00:25:46,830 --> 00:25:48,780
Pasta? Or something spicy?

313
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:50,980
 Alright, I understand. 

314
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:53,520
Where is Yoon Seo? I haven't seen her since earlier.

315
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:57,060
Ah, well, she left for a while saying that she had something to do at her entertainment company.

316
00:25:57,060 --> 00:25:59,970
But is Yoon Seo still a part of that company?

317
00:25:59,970 --> 00:26:02,260
Of course, since she still has some time left to her contract.

318
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:06,480
Since Yoon Seo has cleared all the misunderstandings about her, will she return to the entertainment industry?

319
00:26:06,480 --> 00:26:08,840
I'm not sure. It seems like she has no thoughts of doing that.

320
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,630
Since she started working at this law firm as a secretary because she was interested in this field of work,

321
00:26:11,630 --> 00:26:14,670
wouldn't she more than likely continue doing legal work?

322
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:19,370
Ah, there it is. Let's go eat, to eat.

323
00:26:19,370 --> 00:26:23,500
- Let's go! Let's go!
 - I'll just go to that door right there, seriously. Just to the elevator.

324
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,290
It will be troublesome if you go any farther.

325
00:26:25,290 --> 00:26:27,270
You know this is Always.

326
00:26:27,270 --> 00:26:29,560
What is going on? I'm the CEO of Always Law Firm.

327
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:32,760
Is it true that the law firm that Oh Yoon Seo was pretending to work at is here at Always Law Firm?

328
00:26:32,760 --> 00:26:34,940
I heard that she was making a comeback playing a role as a lawyer. Is that true?

329
00:26:34,940 --> 00:26:37,530
They say that she was practicing her acting as she was working. Were you aware of this?

330
00:26:37,530 --> 00:26:39,620
Did you know that Oh Yoon Seo was going to make a comeback?

331
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:42,940
- Please give us a comment.
 - Please say something.

332
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:45,860
Is it true?

333
00:26:45,860 --> 00:26:49,570
Are you the CEO of Always?

334
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:52,410
- Please give us a comment!
 - Please give a response.

335
00:26:52,410 --> 00:26:56,180
CEO please give us a comment.

336
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:05,830
Ah, Mr. Prosecutor. You look like you're in a good mood.

337
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:08,180
Really? I am really happy

338
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:11,170
because I was able to catch all of the guys who were bothering me.

339
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:17,250
Honestly, I'm just now saying this, but when you asked me for Jeong Ji Ho and Lawyer Choi Yoon Soo's

340
00:27:17,250 --> 00:27:21,250
bank account histories, I really thought that I'd have to quit my job

341
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,050
and was so nervous! Anyway, your sense of ambition and justice

342
00:27:25,070 --> 00:27:28,860
looking ahead to a distant place to see the coast are amazing.

343
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,310
Ah, that's not true.

344
00:27:33,180 --> 00:27:36,890
- Ah! I'll head back first.
 - Ah, okay.

345
00:27:39,380 --> 00:27:41,240
I knew that you would do it.

346
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:42,640
It's all thanks to you.

347
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,860
- Thanks to me?
 - That day,

348
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:48,760
your hug gave me a lot of strength. Thanks.

349
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,040
Let's eat. You must be busy, but make some time for me.

350
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:56,260
Those are the most invigorating words I've heard so far. How about lunch?

351
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:59,160
- When?
 - Right now.
 - Hm?

352
00:28:12,770 --> 00:28:17,810
This was the only place that I thought of where you could avoid the reporters.

353
00:28:17,810 --> 00:28:19,930
Yes, well...

354
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,680
Mr. Lawyer, I'm sorry I couldn't tell you before this.

355
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:29,960
I wanted to tell you everything earlier, but...

356
00:28:46,910 --> 00:28:52,600
Congratulations. It's true that I'm a bit surprised,

357
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,690
but I know how much you like working as an actress.

358
00:28:55,690 --> 00:28:59,810
So I'm also really happy. This is such a great thing.

359
00:29:05,730 --> 00:29:08,340
But why do you look like that?

360
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:11,410
Because I feel so relieved.

361
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:18,070
Well, I was worried that you'd be so disappointed in me that you wouldn't want to see me again.

362
00:29:18,070 --> 00:29:21,800
I was worried that you would tell me we should stop dating.

363
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:26,190
Why would you think something so ridiculous? Didn't I tell you?

364
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:29,590
No matter what it is that you're hiding, if it's what's best for you,

365
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:32,910
then you can do it one hundred or a thousand times over.

366
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:36,210
Mr. Lawyer...

367
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:51,690
I keep getting calls from reporters.

368
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:03,230
Yes, Mr. CEO. Right now, I'm...

369
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:09,250
I'm going to take half the day off today. There's no urgent work, so it will be fine.

370
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:11,070
Yes.

371
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:14,800
- Mr. Lawyer, why are you...?
 - Because I don't want to be interrupted.

372
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:18,320
- Let's play hooky today.
 - Play hooky?

373
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:20,650
Lawyer Kwon said that he'd take half the day off today.

374
00:30:20,650 --> 00:30:25,530
Wow. Is he going to use his half day off to spend it with Yoon Seo today?

375
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,600
What in the world is going on with those two?

376
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:31,200
They held hands tightly and left. Are they dating?

377
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:34,410
You're saying something ridiculous. There's no way that's true.

378
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:36,410
What's wrong with Yoon Seo that she'd date Lawyer Kwon?

379
00:30:36,410 --> 00:30:40,100
Why? What's wrong with our Lawyer Kwon?

380
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:44,650
So what do you all think?

381
00:30:44,650 --> 00:30:48,380
Does it seem like they're dating or like they're not dating?

382
00:30:49,470 --> 00:30:52,490
Everyone who thinks they  are  dating, raise your hand.

383
00:31:18,020 --> 00:31:22,370
Then, what shall we do for fun from now on?

384
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:27,290
I'm not sure.

385
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:34,500
Ah, that's right. You're hungry, aren't you? Then I'll quickly make you some food.

386
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:36,360
You'll make it yourself, Mr. Lawyer?

387
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:40,360
Yes. Why are you so surprised?

388
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:44,860
I've lived alone in Seoul since college, so I can make pretty much anything.

389
00:31:46,130 --> 00:31:49,300
I'm thinking of making kimchi stew since there's really no way to mess that up.

390
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:52,810
Do you like tuna or pork?

391
00:31:56,290 --> 00:31:59,730
I like both. I'll go with pork!

392
00:31:59,730 --> 00:32:01,920
Alright.

393
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:07,050
I'm having the kimchi stew that Mr. Lawyer makes.

394
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:09,130
I'm really looking forward to it.

395
00:32:27,380 --> 00:32:30,170
Where did it go?

396
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:41,660
Kim Se Won, have you seen the pork that was in the fridge?

397
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:45,740
Oh, that? Was it the day before yesterday?

398
00:32:45,740 --> 00:32:49,220
I was hungry while I was finishing up a case, so I cooked it and ate it.

399
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:55,640
Why would you... eat that? You should tell me before you eat it.

400
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:03,780
I don't see the cans of tuna, either.

401
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:06,440
I ate those for breakfast yesterday as a side dish.

402
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,750
I see that you've eaten everything, you jerk.

403
00:33:07,750 --> 00:33:10,470
Ah, well that's one thing. I think I'll be a bit late today.

404
00:33:10,470 --> 00:33:15,040
Alright. Since you're going to be late anyway, just don't ever come back.

405
00:33:18,110 --> 00:33:20,070
What should we do?

406
00:33:20,070 --> 00:33:23,730
- Seems like Prosecutor Kim ate it all. 
  - Yes.

407
00:33:23,730 --> 00:33:26,350
Well, it's okay! I can go quickly and do some grocery shopping.

408
00:33:26,350 --> 00:33:28,380
Then let me go too!

409
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:32,280
But, there has been more public interest in you these days, Oh Jin Sim.

410
00:33:32,280 --> 00:33:34,830
So I think a lot of people will recognize you.

411
00:33:34,830 --> 00:33:37,590
Well then we can go to the markets.

412
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:42,180
The age group there is a bit older so I don't think anyone will be able to recognize me.

413
00:33:42,180 --> 00:33:45,020
Regardless of who looks at you, you look like a celebrity.

414
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:49,890
I guess... a little?

415
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:54,850
Mr. Lawyer, can you lend me some clothes?

416
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,970
Woah, you have so many pretty clothes, Mr. Lawyer.

417
00:34:02,650 --> 00:34:06,730
Can you lend me this and a hat?

418
00:34:09,390 --> 00:34:12,370
I think if I wear this and disguise myself a little, we'll be able to go out.

419
00:34:12,370 --> 00:34:14,090
Okay.

420
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:21,860
- Lipstick? 
 - Ah!

421
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,030
It's lip balm.

422
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:27,870
I have dry lips, so I put it on like this.

423
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:30,860
Mine are dry too...

424
00:34:30,860 --> 00:34:32,810
Then here.

425
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:41,340
Yeah, it feels a bit more moist after putting some on.

426
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:48,870
  ♫ I think you who made me feel so distant ♫  

427

428

00:34:54,070 --> 00:34:57,740
- Thank you, we'll eat it well.

It smells like an air freshener! 
    ♫ I just want to be your star for you  ♫

00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,950
Have you bought this?

00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,900
I'm in such a good mood because today's the first time I've come to the market in a while.

446
00:35:44,010 --> 00:35:46,800
- We're going to eat even more?

447
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,220
We need to eat a meal.

Hello.

Please give us a chicken. We're going to make dak-bokkeum-tang (spicy braised chicken).

452
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:02,370
Sure.

453
00:36:06,010 --> 00:36:10,400
But miss, you look familiar. I feel like I've seen you from somewhere.

454
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:14,710
- There is no way.
 - No, I've definitely seen you somewhere.

455
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:18,720
I'm sure it's me that you saw. I hear that I resemble actors a lot.

456
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:20,630
Tom Cruise, Brad Pitt—

457
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:23,690
I don't know about any Tom or Brad, but

458
00:36:23,690 --> 00:36:27,000
I've definitely seen her somewhere.

459
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:30,650
Oh right! Last time, she's the one who took 4 chickens on credit.

460
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,180
And she never got back to me... Is that her?

461
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:35,470
- No, it isn't me. 
 - Mr. Park!

462
00:36:35,470 --> 00:36:37,990
- It isn't me! 
 - Mr. Park, come here quickly.

463
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,270
- Hey. 
 - Yes?

464
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:43,290
This lady, don't you think you've seen her from somewhere?

465
00:36:43,290 --> 00:36:46,100
Yes, she looks very familiar.

466
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,160
  Yoo Ri's mom, come here for a second.  

467
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,870
Here is the money for the chicken. Thank you! We'll come again. 
   For our body, our chicken  

468
00:36:51,870 --> 00:36:54,980
Where did I see her again?

469
00:36:54,980 --> 00:36:57,670
Wow, this place is the same.

470
00:36:57,670 --> 00:37:00,330
They still don't have many customers.

471
00:37:00,330 --> 00:37:04,150
I was wondering how nice of a restaurant you were going to take me to since you said you would pick the restaurant yourself.

472
00:37:04,150 --> 00:37:06,850
- You only brought me here? 
 - What do you mean only?

473
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:09,990
I missed it, this place, and—

474
00:37:09,990 --> 00:37:12,620
Stop it. Don't say it.

475
00:37:12,620 --> 00:37:16,520
What? How do you know what I'm going to say?

476
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:19,840
I was going to say that I missed the spicy stir-fried pork here.

477
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,270
Then eat a lot.

478
00:37:28,730 --> 00:37:30,630
We ate well, thank you!

479
00:37:30,630 --> 00:37:33,830
- How much is it? 
 - It is 23,000 won.

480
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:37,590
Looking at you now, you guys are those kids.

481
00:37:37,590 --> 00:37:40,610
No wonder, I thought you looked familiar.

482
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:43,700
Do you remember us? We just came for the first time in a really long time.

483
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:45,680
Of course, I remember you. Why wouldn't I?

484
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:48,670
You guys went to the law school in front of here.

485
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,560
You guys were both so good looking.

486
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:54,650
Out of my customers at my restaurant here, you two were the best looking guy and girl.

487
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,250
Your ability to discern that is just as good as your cooking!

488
00:37:58,250 --> 00:38:00,520
Then, shall I guess one more thing correctly?

489
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:03,990
You guys now aren't dating anymore, are you?

490
00:38:05,860 --> 00:38:07,390
How did you know?

491
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:09,760
Why wouldn't I know? Before,

492
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:13,740
he would put all the side dishes in front of you, make you a wrap, and feed it to you.

493
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:18,190
Instead of focusing on what was going into his mouth, it seemed like he was looking more at what was going into yours.

494
00:38:18,190 --> 00:38:21,220
- You weren't like that today. 
 - Well that is because...

495
00:38:21,220 --> 00:38:25,880
It's always like that. Men are the same once they get married.

496
00:38:26,430 --> 00:38:29,650
- I understand. 
 - No, we're actually—

497
00:38:29,650 --> 00:38:32,300
Ah, I made a mistake. I will treat her well in the future.

498
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:36,310
Okay! I'm in a good mood. I'll give you the soda on the house.

499
00:38:36,310 --> 00:38:38,670
- Thank you! 
 - Here.

500
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:42,520
What are you doing?

501
00:38:42,520 --> 00:38:44,500
- Goodbye! 
 - We ate well.

502
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,090
Okay, bye.
 Chuncheon Restaurant 

503
00:38:48,970 --> 00:38:50,950
Kim Se Won.

504
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:54,790
What? We got the soda for free.

505
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,890
Isn't it great?

506
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,000
I ate well, Yoo Yeo Reum.

507
00:38:59,000 --> 00:39:02,800
Me too. Thanks to you, I was able to reminisce on our college times and had fun.

508
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,170
- Next time, let's come again with Jeong Rok. 
 - I don't want to.

509
00:39:07,170 --> 00:39:10,880
I'm tired of seeing him at home already. Why should I have to see him again while outside?

510
00:39:11,710 --> 00:39:15,320
But, until when are you going to mooch off of Jeong Rok and live at his house?

511
00:39:15,320 --> 00:39:17,650
It's not like you don't have a house.

512
00:39:17,650 --> 00:39:20,740
- Why are you? 
 - By house, if you're referring to my parent's house,

513
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:23,320
there won't be any chance of me returning home anytime soon.

514
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:25,090
At that time,

515
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:30,000
I felt like I would die after I heard that my father had vented at you.

516
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:32,850
The father whom I so respected,

517
00:39:32,850 --> 00:39:36,500
the fact that he said such terrible things to the person whom his child loves

518
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:38,820
was something that I could not believe.

519
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,670
That's why I can't go back to that house.

520
00:39:41,670 --> 00:39:44,840
- Se Won, that is... 
 - Therefore,

521
00:39:44,850 --> 00:39:47,250
I wish you would feel some sense of responsibility. I don't need anything else.

522
00:39:47,250 --> 00:39:52,950
I just need the spot next to you, Yoo Yeo Reum. That's enough for me.

523
00:39:53,000 --> 00:39:57,560
So, feel some responsibility.

524
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:01,390
And I hope that you will think about our relationship once again seriously.

525
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:07,090
I want to date you again.

526
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:21,740
Since you did the cooking, Oh Jin Sim, I will do the dishes.

527
00:40:21,750 --> 00:40:27,350
No, what do you mean? Mr. Lawyer, you peeled the potatoes and sliced the carrots!

528
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,950
You helped prepare the ingredients. We should decide who does the dishes

529
00:40:28,950 --> 00:40:31,410
with the loser of a game doing them.

530
00:40:31,410 --> 00:40:35,130
- Game? 
 - Remember we bought Jenga at the market earlier.

531
00:40:35,130 --> 00:40:38,160
- Let's do that. 
 - Okay.

532
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:42,170
But, this tastes very very good. You have outstanding culinary skills.

533
00:40:42,170 --> 00:40:44,750
- Please eat a lot. 
 - Yes.

534
00:40:44,750 --> 00:40:49,010
So, the objective is to take out a block and perform the mission that is written on it, right?

535
00:40:49,010 --> 00:40:52,810
-Yes. And the person who knocks over the Jenga tower is the loser. 
 - Yes.

536
00:40:52,810 --> 00:40:56,000
- Mr. Lawyer, you can go first. 
 - Okay.

537
00:41:01,270 --> 00:41:04,790
What is it? Why are you being like that? Give it to me.

538
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,490
Haha. Show me aegyo! (  cuteness )

539
00:41:07,490 --> 00:41:09,800
I will consider that I have lost.

540
00:41:10,410 --> 00:41:12,760
I will pretend like I didn't hear that.

541
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:14,960
- Hurry up! 
 - Oh!

542
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:22,510
- Bbuing Bbuing. It's so old.

543
00:41:22,510 --> 00:41:25,560
Yeah. I'm someone who's not close to the TV.

544
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:28,160
- Oh Jin Sim, it's your turn. 
 - Yes.

545
00:41:31,150 --> 00:41:33,000
Take a couple selfie together.

546
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:36,130
That's great! We don't have any photos that we took together.

547
00:41:36,130 --> 00:41:39,350
Hold on a second. Since we're taking the picture, let's take a cute one.

548
00:41:39,350 --> 00:41:40,860
Okay.

549
00:41:47,500 --> 00:41:49,850
- Come here. 
 - Ah yes.

550
00:41:57,510 --> 00:42:00,290
I'll send it to you. You should look at it about...

551
00:42:00,290 --> 00:42:02,670
20 times a day!

552
00:42:02,670 --> 00:42:04,410
You got it!

553
00:42:04,410 --> 00:42:06,860
Changing one's name to what they want in the other's phone.

554
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,620
What is it currently?

555
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:12,660
- Secretary Oh Jin Sim. 
 - What, that's too much.

556
00:42:12,660 --> 00:42:15,570
- Well, what should I change it to? 
 - Maybe something like princess?

557
00:42:15,570 --> 00:42:17,470
Then, how about Princess Oh?

558
00:42:17,470 --> 00:42:19,570
Will someone mistake that for five people?

559
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,950
Then I'll change it to Princess Oh Jin Sim.

560
00:42:21,950 --> 00:42:25,530
Do you think that friendships between men and women can exist?

561
00:42:25,530 --> 00:42:28,410
- What are you asking? It's not polite to ask that. 
 - Haha yes, you're right.

562
00:42:28,410 --> 00:42:31,720
- What is the food that you forced yourself to eat, although you didn't want to? 
 - Hmmm...

563
00:42:33,150 --> 00:42:34,650
There isn't any such food like that,

564
00:42:34,650 --> 00:42:38,380
because I was taught that men should eat everything well as I was growing up.

565
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:41,520
- Okay. I got it, okay. 
 - Okay.

566
00:42:47,880 --> 00:42:49,800
Saying a wish?

567
00:42:49,800 --> 00:42:53,570
Tell me anything! I'll make it come true.

568
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:57,690
What should I do?

569
00:42:57,690 --> 00:43:01,990
Hm, there isn't anything that comes to mind right now.

570
00:43:01,990 --> 00:43:03,990
I'll keep this one for later.

571
00:43:03,990 --> 00:43:06,020
Later, regardless,

572
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:08,190
- you have to make it come true no matter what! 
 - Okay, I got it.

573
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,390
- Promise? 
 - Promise.

574
00:43:24,920 --> 00:43:26,710
What brings you here today?

575
00:43:26,710 --> 00:43:29,760
To see CEO Yeon Joon Gyoo.

576
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:33,250
Why is it so dark here?

577
00:43:38,010 --> 00:43:41,700
So what you're saying is, after Lawyer Kwon or whatever his-name-is grabbed her by the hand and took her out,

578
00:43:41,700 --> 00:43:43,400
you haven't been able to contact them?

579
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:45,140
That's what I'm saying.

580
00:43:45,140 --> 00:43:48,610
Yoon Seo's cellphone is off too. I don't really know what's going on.

581
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,060
Are the two of them dating or something?

582
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,130
They probably aren't. No, no, no.

583
00:43:55,130 --> 00:43:59,360
Between our employees, we already voted on whether they're dating or not.

584
00:43:59,360 --> 00:44:03,380
And "they are not dating" had one more vote. They definitely are not dating.

585
00:44:03,380 --> 00:44:05,910
Then why did he grab her hand and go out?

586
00:44:05,910 --> 00:44:08,630
I also asked that to my employees, and they said:

587
00:44:08,630 --> 00:44:12,230
While Lawyer Kwon is prickly, he still has an unexpectedly just personality.

588
00:44:12,230 --> 00:44:14,530
So because he thought that Yoon Seo would be put in a difficult situation,

589
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:16,690
he helped her out. That's the common opinion.

590
00:44:16,690 --> 00:44:20,770
And the grabbing the hand part, they think that in the haste of heading out quickly, he just grabbed whatever he could.

591
00:44:20,770 --> 00:44:25,360
Yes. Correct, that is correct. There is no way that the two of them are dating.

592
00:44:30,660 --> 00:44:32,650
Ah, really?

593
00:44:32,650 --> 00:44:35,470
But why do you look so desperate?

594
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:38,790
It seems like you're desperately hoping that they aren't dating.

595
00:44:39,930 --> 00:44:41,750
It's because I feel sorry looking at you.

596
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:44,990
You entrusted Yoon Seo to me and sent her here, but if a scandal arose here,

597
00:44:44,990 --> 00:44:47,670
would I feel sorry towards you as your Hyung or not?

598
00:44:47,670 --> 00:44:50,410
Y-You'd feel sorry, of course.

599
00:44:52,600 --> 00:44:55,980
Anyway, I hope that they aren't dating as you said.

600
00:44:55,980 --> 00:44:58,890
If it gets found out that Yoon Seo is dating,

601
00:44:58,890 --> 00:45:02,380
then the situation will be really displeasing.

602
00:45:02,380 --> 00:45:04,130
Is it that bad?

603
00:45:04,130 --> 00:45:06,810
Hyung, have you not seen the comments under Yoon Seo's articles?

604
00:45:06,810 --> 00:45:10,510
Since they say that Yoon Seo went to work at a law firm to take on a lawyer role,

605
00:45:10,510 --> 00:45:13,680
the comments are saying things like, "Oh my! Her passion for acting is so amazing!"

606
00:45:13,750 --> 00:45:17,450
"How beautiful to present herself in a low profile. She  abandoned the mindset of a top star."

607
00:45:17,450 --> 00:45:19,550
There are lines of good comments like that.

608
00:45:19,550 --> 00:45:23,550
Think about what will happen if they hear that she was dating while working. Who would like that?

609
00:45:24,250 --> 00:45:28,450
It's been such a difficult road

610
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:31,150
for Yoon Seo's image to get better. Having it go back to the pits again,

611
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:33,210
I can't stand to see that.

612
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,440
You sighed just now, didn't you? You know something. You know something, don't you? You'd know something!

613
00:45:38,440 --> 00:45:40,150
I wouldn't know... Sir!

614
00:45:40,150 --> 00:45:44,790
No, Mr. CEO, if I had known I would have told you earlier.

615
00:45:44,790 --> 00:45:49,910
From what I can see, I don't think those two are in any special relationship. Don't concern yourselves about it too much.

616
00:45:51,730 --> 00:45:55,340
By the way, where in the world are those two and what are they doing?

617
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:07,780
Why are you stopping here?

618
00:46:07,780 --> 00:46:12,710
Ah, since our picture may be taken by reporters if I drop you off right in front of your house,

619
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:17,260
I'll let you out right here and watch you go inside from now on.

620
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,120
Okay.

621
00:46:22,120 --> 00:46:28,380
Then be safe on your way back, Mr. Lawyer. I had fun playing hooky today.

622
00:46:28,380 --> 00:46:30,480
Yes, I had fun, too.

623
00:46:30,480 --> 00:46:31,960
Yes.

624
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,480
Yes? This is Kwon Jeong Rok.

625
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,690
Oh, yes.

626
00:47:00,820 --> 00:47:02,550
Right now?

627
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:12,480
So you're saying that you're not her cousin, but her manager.

628
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:17,670
I'm really sorry for unintentionally fooling you.

629
00:47:17,670 --> 00:47:22,320
Yoon Seo said that she quit working in the entertainment industry and went there to work,

630
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:26,010
so we were worried that people would misunderstand if she went around accompanied by her manager.

631
00:47:26,010 --> 00:47:28,070
Yes, I understand.

632
00:47:28,070 --> 00:47:30,760
But why did you ask to see me?

633
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:35,500
Do you really like our Yoon Seo?

634
00:47:39,030 --> 00:47:42,070
Yes. Of course I do.

635
00:47:47,920 --> 00:47:53,810
Are my feelings for Yoon Seo putting her in a difficult situation?

636
00:47:55,230 --> 00:47:56,980
Mr. Lawyer,

637
00:47:58,020 --> 00:48:01,350
I was discharged from the Army

638
00:48:01,350 --> 00:48:04,510
and was in charge of Yoon Seo since I was 24 years old.

639
00:48:04,510 --> 00:48:07,230
I've only taken care of Yoon Seo for the past ten years.

640
00:48:07,230 --> 00:48:12,460
So you could call Yoon Seo my entire youth.

641
00:48:12,460 --> 00:48:15,080
When things went well for Yoon Seo, I was happier than she was.

642
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:20,970
And when things were bad for her, I had a really hard time.

643
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:24,360
When Yoon Seo's scandal broke out back then,

644
00:48:24,360 --> 00:48:28,700
I couldn't talk to anyone about it, so I went to Han River and cried my eyes out as I drank soju.

645
00:48:28,700 --> 00:48:32,610
I prayed every single day that she could make a comeback.

646
00:48:32,610 --> 00:48:35,010
You would know this well since you've been with Yoon Seo.

647
00:48:35,010 --> 00:48:38,840
She started working when she was just a teenager

648
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:41,240
and doesn't know how to do anything but act.

649
00:48:41,240 --> 00:48:44,980
But the fact that someone like that made it through three months like this

650
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,430
was because she wanted to return  to doing dramas

651
00:48:48,430 --> 00:48:52,810
and wanted to go back to the time when she was loved by everyone.

652
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:54,940
That was her sole reason.

653
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:59,810
You've probably seen the articles too, but because of Yoon Seo's drama

654
00:48:59,810 --> 00:49:03,160
it's become known that she was earnestly working at the law firm

655
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:05,370
and her image has improved a great deal.

656
00:49:05,370 --> 00:49:07,090
But if

657
00:49:07,670 --> 00:49:11,650
the fact that she's dating you is discovered

658
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:15,870
then her sincerity may be doubted again.

659
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:19,970
Mr. Lawyer,

660
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,540
this is a very important period of time for Yoon Seo.

661
00:49:27,810 --> 00:49:30,600
What is that you want to say?

662
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,060
It's really cliché for me to say this,

663
00:49:36,300 --> 00:49:39,580
but I want you to break up with Yoon Seo, for her sake.

664
00:49:49,450 --> 00:49:51,920
This is a really cliché answer,

665
00:49:51,920 --> 00:49:56,200
but I really like Oh Jin Sim, a lot.

666
00:49:56,950 --> 00:50:02,350
I will never be the first one to mention breaking up.

667
00:50:02,450 --> 00:50:06,350
I thought that he would be upset because I couldn't tell him first,

668
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:09,150
but he sincerely congratulated me.

669
00:50:11,420 --> 00:50:16,050
I really don't deserve Mr. Lawyer. 
♫  When your eyes and lips  ♫

670
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:20,680
♫  are saying something different to me  ♫

671
00:50:22,770 --> 00:50:26,880
♫  how can I be holding on to you?  ♫

672
00:50:29,320 --> 00:50:36,620
♫  Always wet, your pillow  ♫

673
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:37,780
♫  is now  ♫

674
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:41,350
 Mr. Lawyer, I really enjoyed today. 
♫  going to get dry  ♫ 

675
00:50:41,350 --> 00:50:43,400
 I'm happy about being cast in the drama, 

676
00:50:43,450 --> 00:50:48,950
 but I'm most happy about being cast as your girlfriend.
 ♫  To the extent you and I struggled   ♫ 

677
00:50:48,950 --> 00:50:54,050
♫  We fought hard  ♫

678
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:59,250
♫  Even being angry, we did a lot  ♫

679
00:50:59,250 --> 00:51:06,150
♫  We don't have to care anymore about the early morning  ♫

680
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:11,650
♫  Now it's a comfortable Good Night  ♫

681
00:51:15,380 --> 00:51:17,660
Omo, what's with this?

682
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,330
They must be dating, right? In the comments, about Lawyer Kwon—

683
00:51:20,330 --> 00:51:22,260
Good morning.

684
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:31,680
Why are you looking at me like that?

685
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,560
I don't know. Why would I be?

686
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:35,150
I'm not sure. Why would you be?

687
00:51:35,150 --> 00:51:39,270
Yesterday, after you grabbed Yoon Seo's hand and left, I couldn't get in touch with either of you all day.

688
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:40,770
And...

689
00:51:42,120 --> 00:51:45,290
What's up with this picture?

690
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:49,100
Hae Young said that it was uploaded on a community message board that she frequents.

691
00:51:49,100 --> 00:51:52,960
Someone saw you, and they said that it seemed like an atmosphere between lovers, no matter who looked at you.

692
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:57,230
Explain what's going on. Expl-pl-plain!

693
00:51:59,600 --> 00:52:02,320
I don't want to explain it.

694
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:08,370
Wait, you're saying... You and Yoon Seo are really dating?

695
00:52:11,930 --> 00:52:16,640
Of course not. I just helped her yesterday because it seemed like something troublesome would happen to my secretary.

696
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:20,660
In this picture, we were just eating together and talking.

697
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:23,610
So everyone, don't have any strange misunderstandings.

698
00:52:28,060 --> 00:52:31,530
It's a picture of them eating together. Just eating.

699
00:52:33,030 --> 00:52:34,770
Yes.

700
00:52:35,490 --> 00:52:37,460
I'm sorry for yesterday.

701
00:52:37,460 --> 00:52:41,380
Yes, Mr. CEO. I got it for now.

702
00:52:41,380 --> 00:52:43,030
Yes.

703
00:52:50,230 --> 00:52:53,090
Is it your entertainment company's CEO?

704
00:52:53,850 --> 00:52:55,500
Yes.

705
00:52:56,320 --> 00:53:00,230
Is he possibly acting like that because of the picture on the community message board?

706
00:53:00,230 --> 00:53:03,750
Mr. Lawyer, you saw that our picture was uploaded too?

707
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:04,700
Yes.

708
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:10,100
It must have spread around a lot more than I thought.

709
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:13,650
The CEO said that if the story happens to come out in an article,

710
00:53:13,650 --> 00:53:16,170
then he would release a rebuttal.

711
00:53:16,170 --> 00:53:21,400
He said he would write that you've been the lawyer in charge of me the entire time I've worked at the law firm,

712
00:53:21,400 --> 00:53:26,100
and that we're only in that kind of official relationship.

713
00:53:27,830 --> 00:53:32,220
Will you possibly be upset?

714
00:53:32,220 --> 00:53:33,180
What?

715
00:53:33,180 --> 00:53:39,170
I really hate scandal articles coming out because of ridiculous rumors,

716
00:53:39,170 --> 00:53:42,530
but it's true that I'm dating you,

717
00:53:42,530 --> 00:53:44,620
so I don't care even if articles do come out.

718
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:49,800
So, if there's a chance that you'll feel upset—

719
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:54,420
I'm fine, so I think it would be best to do as your CEO says.

720
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:57,190
But still, Mr. Lawyer...

721
00:53:57,190 --> 00:54:00,970
Now that I'm watching from beside you, I think that people who receive attention from the general public

722
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:04,880
have their private lives exposed to an excessive extent.

723
00:54:04,880 --> 00:54:09,760
Because it seems that you're being hurt by unnecessary words and are receiving excessive reproof,

724
00:54:11,450 --> 00:54:14,190
I think it would best to be careful.

725
00:54:29,390 --> 00:54:31,490
So you were here, Lawyer Kwon.

726
00:54:33,950 --> 00:54:38,750
I have something I'm worried about. Could you help me with it?

727
00:54:39,420 --> 00:54:40,970
Yes.

728
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:47,870
What  is this?

729
00:54:47,870 --> 00:54:50,380
You know that Yoon Seo's last day of work here is this week, right?

730
00:54:50,380 --> 00:54:54,730
So I'm going to pick one of Oh Yoon Seo's legendary videos

731
00:54:54,730 --> 00:54:57,890
and make a GIF out of it as a goodbye gift.

732
00:54:57,890 --> 00:55:00,440
I don't know which one will be better. Which one would be better?

733
00:55:00,440 --> 00:55:03,230
Is this what you're worried about?

734
00:55:03,230 --> 00:55:05,090
Yeah.

735
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:10,260
But you know, our Yoon Seo...

736
00:55:10,260 --> 00:55:12,220
Isn't she so warm hearted?

737
00:55:12,220 --> 00:55:14,800
Her expression is different than it was when she was here.

738
00:55:14,800 --> 00:55:18,860
As I thought, our Yoon Seo shines when she's acting.

739
00:55:18,860 --> 00:55:21,000
Look at her smiling so brightly at me.

740
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:26,300
There really isn't much time left now.

741
00:55:26,300 --> 00:55:31,250
In a few days, we'll have to send off our Yoon Seo,

742
00:55:31,250 --> 00:55:34,500
who was like the female lead of Roman Holiday. Goodness.

743
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:37,500
- I'm curious about something.
- What?

744
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:42,670
What happened to the female lead of Roman Holiday, Princess Anne, in the end?

745
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:48,670
The princess went back to where she originally was.

746
00:55:49,620 --> 00:55:53,080
When you look at it, that's an expected conclusion.

747
00:56:09,410 --> 00:56:14,690
 You experience many different lifestyles while working as an actress. It seems very interesting. 

748
00:56:16,180 --> 00:56:20,200
 Back then, I was really happy. 

749
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:25,340
 There were more joyful things. My heart would race when I received an interesting script, 

750
00:56:25,340 --> 00:56:28,850
 and when I saw a site buzzing with activity, I felt so alive. 

751
00:56:28,850 --> 00:56:33,620
 And if I worked hard at filming and the results of the broadcast were good, I felt a sense of accomplishment. 

752
00:56:33,620 --> 00:56:36,490
 There were more happy memories like that. 

753
00:57:02,260 --> 00:57:06,290
Let's cheer for the new start of the Universe's Goddess Oh Yoon Seo.

754
00:57:09,780 --> 00:57:13,470
Ah, you even prepared a farewell party for me. Thank you so much.

755
00:57:13,470 --> 00:57:17,640
Aigo, what do you mean thank you? Because you safely finished working three months with us here at Always,

756
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,230
I'm more thankful.

757
00:57:19,230 --> 00:57:23,380
It's very saddening to think that we won't be able to see you from now on.

758
00:57:23,380 --> 00:57:27,940
Wait, why wouldn't you be able to see me? I'm going to come by often.

759
00:57:27,940 --> 00:57:30,070
- Really? You promised!
 - Yes!

760
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:37,820
Then, this may be presumptuous, but please be sure and promise.

761
00:57:37,870 --> 00:57:39,580
Yes!

762
00:57:39,630 --> 00:57:42,510
Stamped!

763
00:57:42,510 --> 00:57:44,710
Take a picture. You need to take a commemoration picture!

764
00:57:44,710 --> 00:57:47,870
Okay! One, two, three.

765
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:52,580
Instead of a commemoration photo, should I have gotten a notarization?

766
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:55,090
Alright, let's eat. Yoon Seo, have a seat.

767
00:57:56,120 --> 00:58:00,180
But there isn't anyone here but us.

768
00:58:00,220 --> 00:58:03,140
Did you rent out the whole building?

769
00:58:03,140 --> 00:58:08,340
Of course, I did. Yoon Seo said that she liked meat, so I specially made a reservation at this place.

770
00:58:08,340 --> 00:58:12,650
I guarantee this restaurant's meat taste, so eat a lot.

771
00:58:12,650 --> 00:58:15,780
I'm so touched!

772
00:58:15,780 --> 00:58:18,290
- Eat up.
 - Thank you.

773
00:58:22,190 --> 00:58:25,310
But I don't see Lawyer Kwon.

774
00:58:25,310 --> 00:58:29,280
Ah, that's because he said that he would go meet with a client before he came.

775
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,430
Hey, he should have pushed his appointment until later. This is still Yoon Seo's farewell party, after all.

776
00:58:33,430 --> 00:58:38,110
Ah, I guess he had no choice since it's an important client.

777
00:58:39,540 --> 00:58:44,680
Since Lawyer Kwon didn't come to her farewell party, it seems they really aren't dating. Right?

778
00:58:44,680 --> 00:58:46,830
Seriously, please stop it. Goodness, seriously.

779
00:58:49,290 --> 00:58:51,430
Here. Have a glass of alcohol.

780
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:55,790
Mr. Lawyer, is it still a long time until you're done?

781
00:58:55,790 --> 00:58:56,910
- Ma'am! 
- Yes?

782
00:58:56,910 --> 00:58:59,120
- Please give us some more meat!
 - Please give us five more servings.

783
00:58:59,120 --> 00:59:00,230
Okay!

784
00:59:00,280 --> 00:59:03,840
To Yoon Seo!

785
00:59:11,490 --> 00:59:13,970
Ah, this place is delicious.

786
00:59:13,970 --> 00:59:15,860
Wow, it's really good.

787
00:59:15,860 --> 00:59:20,530
Wow. The article looking forward to Secretary Oh's drama has already made the main headlines!

788
00:59:20,530 --> 00:59:22,270
- Look.
 - Whoa!
 - Look at that.

789
00:59:22,320 --> 00:59:27,140
It seems like people all feel the same. I'm also really looking forward to it.

790
00:59:27,170 --> 00:59:30,970
I also will watch the premiere episode live. Ah, seriously...

791
00:59:30,970 --> 00:59:34,030
Goodness, seriously. Please stop it.

792
00:59:34,030 --> 00:59:37,180
I'm in a good mood, but I keep crying.

793
00:59:37,900 --> 00:59:40,600
Yoon Seo, you can't forget us.

794
00:59:40,600 --> 00:59:42,810
You're really making her want to forget.

795
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:44,490
This is my first time crying, goodness.

796
00:59:44,490 --> 00:59:47,650
But what's the drama about? Did they say it was a courtroom drama?

797
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:51,070
Ah, it's not only that genre.

798
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:54,490
It's a romantic comedy with the courtroom as the background.

799
00:59:54,490 --> 01:00:00,610
It tells the stories of the lawyers, and it also talks about a man and a woman who like each other but aren't sure of each other's feelings.

800
01:00:00,610 --> 01:00:04,110
It tells the story of what happens after they end up in a dating contract.

801
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:06,630
- Wow, that sounds interesting!
 - It sounds fun!

802
01:00:06,630 --> 01:00:09,410
A contract relationship? Oh, it's so childish!

803
01:00:22,430 --> 01:00:26,360
A dating contract, she said?

804
01:00:39,260 --> 01:00:41,070
Please head on.

805
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,590
Alright.

806
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:48,910
Lawyer Choi, do you want to be in a contract relationship with me?

807
01:00:48,910 --> 01:00:50,460
What?

808
01:00:51,730 --> 01:00:55,410
Actually, I have feelings for you, Lawyer Choi.

809
01:00:55,410 --> 01:01:01,570
So will you date me for just one month, no more and no less?

810
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:03,190
What do you think?

811
01:01:03,190 --> 01:01:07,050
 It's not even a salary contract or a housing contract. 

812
01:01:07,080 --> 01:01:12,740
 What should I do with this provocative woman who makes my heart race 

813
01:01:12,740 --> 01:01:15,960
 with just the word "contract"? 

814
01:01:23,360 --> 01:01:25,140
 You're not replying. 

815
01:01:25,140 --> 01:01:29,080
 Are you unable to come today? 

816
01:01:33,220 --> 01:01:34,890
 Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok 

817
01:01:47,040 --> 01:01:48,240
I'm a bit late, aren't I?

818
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:50,290
Mr. Lawyer!

819
01:01:55,370 --> 01:02:00,850
You didn't get in touch with me. I thought you wouldn't be able to come because you were busy!

820
01:02:00,850 --> 01:02:05,250
Because you're my secretary that worked hard for me,

821
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:08,070
I thought that we would need a special farewell party.

822
01:02:08,070 --> 01:02:13,210
So I was a bit late because I was preparing my own farewell party.

823
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:16,100
Your own farewell party?

824
01:02:16,100 --> 01:02:17,570
Yes.

825
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:26,440
Why are we at a movie theater all of a sudden?

826
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:29,460
Since you're uncomfortable in regular movie theaters and can't go to them,

827
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:33,530
I rented the whole thing out so that you can watch the movie comfortably.

828
01:02:33,530 --> 01:02:36,490
What? Really?

829
01:02:36,510 --> 01:02:41,370
I requested a movie that you like. I hope you'll enjoy it.

830
01:02:42,210 --> 01:02:44,880
- Let's go.
 - Okay.

831
01:02:46,940 --> 01:02:48,860
Roman Holiday?

832
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:19,070
I really had fun today.

833
01:03:19,070 --> 01:03:22,060
That was a movie that I really wanted to watch with you,

834
01:03:22,060 --> 01:03:24,960
so I was really happy to watch it like this.

835
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:29,170
If that's the case, I'm glad.

836
01:03:29,170 --> 01:03:31,150
It was totally perfect.

837
01:03:31,150 --> 01:03:34,880
Your special farewell party that you prepared.

838
01:03:34,880 --> 01:03:38,470
Ah, the feeling of the word "farewell party" is a little sad.

839
01:03:38,500 --> 01:03:43,830
That feels like we're separating, but we're only unable to meet at the law firm, that's all.

840
01:03:43,830 --> 01:03:46,810
Of course, that's also really saddening.

841
01:03:55,520 --> 01:03:57,850
Oh Yoon Seo...

842
01:03:59,370 --> 01:04:03,900
Why are you suddenly calling me Oh Yoon Seo?

843
01:04:04,970 --> 01:04:11,550
♫  Your warmth which is left on   ♫

844
01:04:11,550 --> 01:04:19,750
Thanks to you, I was happy.
 ♫  my left fingertip  ♫

845
01:04:19,750 --> 01:04:21,240
Why are you saying that?

846
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:25,640
♫  is covering the left side of my breast  ♫

847
01:04:25,640 --> 01:04:32,160
Like what happened in the movie earlier, Oh Jin Sim, I want you to return
 ♫  As it was then  ♫

848
01:04:34,070 --> 01:04:40,240
to your place as Oh Yoon Seo, and I will return to my original place. 
♫  I'm saying I can't let go  ♫

849
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:44,130
♫  of your right hand  ♫

850
01:04:44,130 --> 01:04:47,700
What do you mean by that, Mr. Lawyer?

851
01:04:47,700 --> 01:04:52,990
♫  which was left on my left fingertip  ♫

852
01:04:52,990 --> 01:05:01,370
♫  because the trembling fingertips must hold on  ♫

853
01:05:01,370 --> 01:05:04,200
Let's...

854
01:05:06,710 --> 01:05:09,760
break up.

 ~ Preview ~ 

862
01:05:49,740 --> 01:05:53,400
 She seems much happier than she was when she was at our law firm. 

863
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,780
 It's really nice to see you acting like a person who's crazy about their work. 

864
01:05:56,780 --> 01:06:00,000
 - We'll begin filming!
 - I'm ready! 

865
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,100
 Honey, how do I look today? 

866
01:06:02,100 --> 01:06:04,870
 Are you two possibly...? You can't fool me. 

867
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:08,050
 Where is Kwon Jeong Rok? I asked you where Kwon Jeong Rok is! 

868
01:06:08,050 --> 01:06:09,770
 Are you going to take the Park Soo Myeong appeal? 

869
01:06:09,770 --> 01:06:11,130
 It's said Park Soo Myeong is the true culprit... 

870
01:06:11,130 --> 01:06:13,010
 I am also scared. 

871
01:06:13,010 --> 01:06:16,680
 Because from this point forward, I don't think that I'll have the right 

872
01:06:17,750 --> 01:06:20,280
 to be anyone's lawyer. 

873
01:06:21,880 --> 01:06:23,190
 Okay! 

874
01:06:23,190 --> 01:06:26,450
 Are you like this because you're thinking of that person? 

875
01:06:26,450 --> 01:06:28,490
 He's doing well, right? 
♫  I, who am not ready  ♫
