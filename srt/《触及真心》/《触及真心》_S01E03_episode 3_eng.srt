1
00:00:00,070 --> 00:00:07,010


2
00:00:07,100 --> 00:00:08,600
 Missing. She's Gone. Yoon Seo Oh! 

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:10,730
 Actress Oh Yoon Seo, Current whereabouts? 

4
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:17,600
 CALL 

5
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:34,930
 Touch Your Heart 

6
00:00:35,860 --> 00:00:41,200
 Touch Your Heart 

7
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:45,700
Oh Jin Sim.

8
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,020
Yes?

9
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:54,370
I have never thought of you as my secretary up to now.

10
00:00:56,720 --> 00:01:02,090
It is true that I considered you an annoying presence since you are to leave shortly.

11
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,470
But I've decided to change that thinking from now on.

12
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,250
Pardon?

13
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:13,490
I want to give you a proper chance to work as my secretary.

14
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:18,290
Let's start again from the beginning.

15
00:01:18,290 --> 00:01:20,350
For real?

16
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,020
Thank you, Mr. Lawyer!

17
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:35,760
I will seriously do my best!

18
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:08,250
I...

19
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:12,530
I didn't dodge you this time.

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,300
Anyway ... please take care of me from now on.

21
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:24,800
Well, please take care of me too.

22
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,660
Then. I'll go ahead.

23
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:27,700
Yes.

24
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:31,200
♬  That warm smile. I think I've changed.  ♬

25
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,000

♬  I've gotten curious about you  ♬

27

♬  I'm so confused  ♬

28
00:02:38,620 --> 00:02:39,370
Yes?

29
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:41,480
You have to go this way.

30
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:45,770
Oh, that's right. This way. 
 ♬ I just wanna be a star for you  ♬

31

♬  With twinkling star light ♬

36
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,300
 Well, it seems he caught me because he thought I might fall. 

37
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:16,300
 He's got some comradeship and he's not as rude as I thought. 

38
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:20,200
 Episode 3 
 ♬  I will fill your heart  ♬

39
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,310
 Thirty-five year old Ms. Im, who has been charged with stabbing her husband to death, 

40
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:26,600
 has been transferred to the prosecution this evening. 

41
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:31,210
 At the time of discovery, the condition of her husband's body 

42
00:03:31,210 --> 00:03:34,460
 was seriously injured, with two stab wounds. 

43
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,000
You're late.

44
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:49,830
Why? You missed me?

45
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,600
There's no way.

46
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:54,210
I was just reviewing some case files.

47
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,620
- Did you drink? 
 - Yeah.

48
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,710
- There are a lot of firm dinners recently. 
 - It wasn't a firm dinner.

49
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:07,010
Then, is it a date?

50
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,360
It's not a date either.

51
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,000
This is suspicious.

52
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,600
There's nothing suspicious.

53
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,380
I drank with my new secretary.

54
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:16,660
Just the two of you?

55
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:19,000
Didn't you dislike that secretary?

56
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,210
I did.

57
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,010
You said you did.

58
00:04:22,010 --> 00:04:24,340
Seeing that is past tense, she must be alright now.

59
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:26,180
Yes.

60
00:04:26,180 --> 00:04:28,070
Is she pretty?

61
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:31,330
- Crazy bastard. 
 - You said she was good!

62
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:33,850
I said she's good as a secretary.

63
00:04:33,850 --> 00:04:37,110
Ah. As a secretary.

64
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:41,690
This rascal.

65
00:04:41,690 --> 00:04:44,190
Hurry up and shower. There's fine dust.

66
00:04:47,350 --> 00:04:51,370
Now that I've been acknowledged as a secretary,

67
00:04:51,420 --> 00:04:53,950
I will properly do it.

68
00:04:56,050 --> 00:05:00,140
Then, I should have some proper secretary outfits.

69
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,960
Should I go shopping on the weekend?

70
00:05:07,470 --> 00:05:10,090
Oppa, you're already here?

71
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:13,220
What? You got hurt? Where?

72
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:17,960
The thing is ... yesterday at the  military reserve drill, I sprained my leg.

73
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:21,340
What should I do? I don't think I can come and pick you up for a few days.

74
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:24,790
That's not the problem right now. You're not badly hurt, right?

75
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:26,630
No, no.

76
00:05:26,630 --> 00:05:30,420
I've assigned a road manager to come and pick you up, so don't worry.

77
00:05:30,450 --> 00:05:32,160
If anything happens, just call me.

78
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,320
By the way, if that rude lawyer bullies you again,

79
00:05:35,320 --> 00:05:37,620
you tell me right away, understand?

80
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:40,700
That won't happen anymore.

81
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:43,260
I guess now he has recognized my true worth.

82
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:47,440
While treating me to sogopchang  (grilled beef tripe),  he told me I should continue to work as his secretary

83
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:51,940
and asked me to take care of him.

84
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:57,450
So instead of worrying about me, take care of yourself. Okay?

85
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,000
- Good morning! 
 - Good morning!

86
00:06:17,030 --> 00:06:20,490
Be strong today, as well.  Fighting!

87
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,580
Oh Yeon Soo looks so happy today.

88
00:06:27,580 --> 00:06:30,410
Maybe it's because she saw me this morning.

89
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,380
Yes?

90
00:06:42,350 --> 00:06:45,720
Hello, Mr. Lawyer.

91
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:51,300
You must be tired because you went home late last night, but I see you're here early.

92
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,100
Yes, well ...

93
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:57,340
Your necktie suits you perfectly.

94
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,710
You have a unique sense of fashion. Is it because you do your shopping yourself?

95
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:06,730
Oh Jin Sim, take this.

96
00:07:08,100 --> 00:07:11,970
I've made a list of the tasks you should be doing in the future.

97
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:14,160
These are the tasks I need to do?

98
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,270
There's a lot more work for a legal secretary to do beyond transferring phone calls and copying.

99
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,990
This is a daily journal from my prior secretary.

100
00:07:20,990 --> 00:07:23,830
You'll find more specifics if you look at it.

101
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,000
Then, please work hard.

102
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,730
Yes.

103
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,830
What the?  Weren't we getting chummy?

104
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:44,260
"After confirming the  written court schedule, notify the client."

105
00:07:44,260 --> 00:07:46,220
"Review for errors and typos, and what?

106
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:48,670
"Access the electronic litigation site and submit the document via pdf.

107
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,130
Why is there so much?

108
00:07:53,130 --> 00:07:55,160
 You must code each event in a case. 

109
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:58,520
 After classifying them, you must orgainize incoming and outgoing documents by code. 

110
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:00,450
 www.lawyers_docu.com 

111
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:10,800
As to court pleadings you must separate the copy for court, for the opposing party, and our file.

112
00:08:13,110 --> 00:08:15,100
 Please give me the Certificate of Service. 

113
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,570
Do you just want to file it, or do you want expedited filing?

114
00:08:17,570 --> 00:08:20,540
Well, I think it better be expedited.

115
00:08:20,540 --> 00:08:21,450
Yes.

116
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:24,550
It's done.

117
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:31,450
Please give me 10 copies of this, 10 copies of this one, and 15 copies of this one.

118
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:34,780
I'm going to meet a client and will go home from there.

119
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:41,870
Since you said that you would give me a proper chance to work, you're properly slaving me.

120
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,760
I shouldn't have eaten the gopchang yesterday.

121
00:08:59,310 --> 00:09:03,460
Oh, I want to be in this drama.

122
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,500
Especially this scene.  The scene where the female attorney explodes with charisma in court.

123
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:12,010
I think it's going to be so awesome.

124
00:09:13,650 --> 00:09:19,200
 Is it true that Bujin ( "Shoddy" ) Construction with whom the witness is affiliated performed the work 

125
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,770
 in compliance with the subcontract for demolition work  from the Defendant? 

126
00:09:21,770 --> 00:09:23,020
 Yes. 

127
00:09:24,110 --> 00:09:29,910
 The Defendant completed the demoliition through Bujin Consruction. 

128
00:09:29,960 --> 00:09:35,870
 Didn't you fail to pay for the construction work due to your failure to obtain financing? 

129
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:46,550
 Your Honor, that witness is lying now! 

130
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:51,490
I love you.

131
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:58,100
I'm sure I'll have a lot of work tomorrow, too.

132
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:02,290
I have to watch lawyers at work for this to be helpful to me.

133
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:06,310
Really?

134
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:08,680
Can I really go with you?

135
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:11,220
To where you are going to meet your sunbae ( senior ) attorney?

136
00:10:11,270 --> 00:10:12,870
Actually, he's not only my sunbae.

137
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:16,610
Sunbae is the lawyer in charge of the claim for damages for victims in my Zen Industry case.

138
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:22,490
Yes... But aren't the real reasons for meeting an opposing lawyer

139
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:28,270
to feel each other's intentions out, to divert each other's attention, and to fight?

140
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,830
Can I  accompany you to such an important place?

141
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:33,870
We're just going to eat and to exchange greetings.

142
00:10:33,870 --> 00:10:36,440
Well, if you don't want to go, you don't have to.

143
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:39,760
I just thought  that as long you are working as a secretary, it might be helpful.

144
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:43,690
It will be helpful.  It's perfect. I'll go no matter what.

145
00:10:43,730 --> 00:10:48,930
But, it's a secret that I am working here.  I think I'm going to have to go out in disguise.

146
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:52,370
What about putting a beauty mark here before I go out?

147
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,930
Would just putting a beauty mark there work?

148
00:10:55,930 --> 00:10:57,370
Huh?

149
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:00,770
I've prepared stuff for that evenutality, so don't worry.

150
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:02,920
Really?

151
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,020
OMG, you are thorough!

152
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:12,800
What do you think? No one will be able to tell it's Oh Jin Sim, right?

153
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:17,530
Of course not. How would they recognize me when I look like this?

154
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,790
Ah, seriously. Do I really have to go this far?

155
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,880
I'm asking if it's a realistic concept for a legal secretary to go around looking like this.

156
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,490
Most people can't even recognize me when I just wear sunglasses.

157
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,120
It's because he isn't "most people."

158
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,490
What?

159
00:11:34,490 --> 00:11:36,860
This sunbae is a major fan of yours.

160
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,870
But even so—

161
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:43,510
What? You said he's my fan?

162
00:11:43,510 --> 00:11:46,890
Yes. He's watched every single drama that you've been in.

163
00:11:46,890 --> 00:11:49,740
What is this? My goodness.

164
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:53,820
Your sunbae has a good eye.

165
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:58,720
Just let it go.  What's the point in defeating a good person like that?

166
00:11:58,720 --> 00:12:00,400
What?

167
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,890
I'm joking.

168
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,260
Anyway, if he finds out that I came there with you,

169
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,810
he's going to be overly interested in you.

170
00:12:08,810 --> 00:12:12,520
Then you'll also be uncomfortable. And I hate situations like that.

171
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:17,070
If that's your reason, then I'll put it on. I'll put it on right away.

172
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:19,940
Ah, and I have one other request.

173
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,370
What is it?

174
00:12:21,370 --> 00:12:24,540
You can't say a single word.

175
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,930
Why?

176
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:29,730
You're worried that he'll recognize my voice.

177
00:12:29,730 --> 00:12:32,920
Okay. Don't worry.

178
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:40,400
Hello, Sunbaenim.

179
00:12:40,400 --> 00:12:43,170
Hey, it's been a while, Lawyer Kwon. You're looking good.

180
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,920
Thank you.

181
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,990
This is my secretary, who is assisting me with my work.

182
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:54,750
Right now she is on probation, so she is learning.  She accompanies me to most of my appointments.

183
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,740
But why is she dressed like...?

184
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:01,800
She stained her clothes on the way to work, so she's wearing the firm's work-out clothing. As for her face...

185
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:04,720
She's riddled with pimples.

186
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:24,670
Miss Secretary, why don't you take off your mask for a moment?

187
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,380
You should still eat with us.

188
00:13:27,380 --> 00:13:29,680
Sunbaenim, do you still play golf?

189
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:33,360
When would I have time for that? I'm flooded with work.

190
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,990
On top of that, the latest case I've been assigned is a real pain in the ass.

191
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,330
Ah, shall we meet at the course next time?

192
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:40,610
Shall we?

193
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:43,870
Yes. We'll play a round of golf and eat a healthy meal.

194
00:13:43,870 --> 00:13:46,280
There's a great eel place near there.

195
00:13:46,280 --> 00:13:47,760
That sounds good.

196
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:51,420
By the way, I feel bad that we're the only ones eating.

197
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,520
She's on a diet, so you don't have to worry about her too much.

198
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:59,690
She said that none of her clothes fit because she's gained three kilos recently.

199
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,160
What? My face is riddled with pimples?

200
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:20,990
My clothes don't fit because I gained three kilos?

201
00:14:20,990 --> 00:14:24,380
He said he was meeting the opposing attorney.  I thought they would have a war of nerves with sparks flying.

202
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:27,130
They are only exchanging useless crap.

203
00:14:27,130 --> 00:14:30,950
I wouldn't have come here if I had known it was a place where I can't help him anyway.

204
00:14:30,950 --> 00:14:33,830
What is this?

205
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:42,260
You said that you go by Secretary Oh, right?

206
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,020
You weren't able to eat any food. Aren't you hungry?

207
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:51,330
But I'm curious about something.

208
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:54,580
Lawyer Kwon is great at his job, but he's not personable at all.

209
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:58,120
Isn't it hard for you to work under a boss like that?

210
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,530
If you feel like you can't do it any longer, come to me any time.

211
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:06,760
My secretary happened to quit not too long ago, so the position is empty.

212
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:10,960
What are you doing? You won't take it?

213
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:19,560
Those fingers are strangely familiar.

214
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,930
The part of your face that I can see looks familiar too. Where in the world have I seen you?

215
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:25,810
Can you take off that mask for a moment?

216
00:15:25,810 --> 00:15:28,590
If not that, at least the sunglasses. I know this is rude,

217
00:15:28,590 --> 00:15:31,240
but even your neckline strangely seems so familiar.

218
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:34,980
I'm not trying to sexually harass you. I just really feel like I've seen you somewhere before.

219
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:38,150
So can you take it off just once?

220
00:15:38,150 --> 00:15:40,060
I'm the type of person who can't stand to be curious about something.

221
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:42,220
What are you doing here?

222
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:46,670
Did you happen to hear our conversation?

223
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:50,600
Yes. Please don't do anything else that is rude

224
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,830
to  my  secretary.

225
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:58,430
Let's go.

226
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,470
Are you alright?

227
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:19,180
Yes? Ah.

228
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:23,250
Of course. He was really rude, but...

229
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:30,790
Why are you looking at me like that?

230
00:16:30,790 --> 00:16:33,270
Because I just suddenly remembered someone else who was rude to me.

231
00:16:33,270 --> 00:16:36,200
I don't have any trouble with acne. I have totally honey-like skin!

232
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:41,500
And I didn't gain three kilos! I've always maintained a weight of 48 kilos!

233
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:46,200
I'm sorry. That was the only excuses I could come up with to convince him in that situation.

234
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,710
I know. I know, but I'm annoyed. What can I do about it?

235
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:54,050
Let's go get something to eat. You must be really hungry since you couldn't eat anything earlier.

236
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:55,500
I'll buy you something delicious.

237
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:58,660
Forget it. I'm not hungry!

238
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,160
Then, we'll go to the closest restaurant.

239
00:17:10,950 --> 00:17:13,210
Our Yoon Seo is doing well, right?

240
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:18,860
Of course! She's adjusted so well that I think she should stay at the company for thirty years instead of three months.

241
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:24,930
She's good at her job, she has a nice personality, she's pretty, and she gets along with her coworkers very well.

242
00:17:24,930 --> 00:17:27,690
But from what I've heard,

243
00:17:27,690 --> 00:17:31,060
she doesn't seem to get along with the lawyer in charge of her that well. It seems like they clash a lot.

244
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,350
What was his name? Ah, Kwon Jeong Rok. I heard that he was really rude.

245
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:38,290
Rude? Rude...

246
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:39,830
Well, he could be seen as rude.

247
00:17:39,830 --> 00:17:42,200
So then why did you put Yoon Seo with a guy like that?

248
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,930
He's really good at his job.

249
00:17:43,930 --> 00:17:49,100
He's the best in the field and the number one pick of the clients. He's our law firm's ace.

250
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,080
So that's why you have no control over him whatsoever.

251
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:53,950
Ah, he's made me so much money.

252
00:17:53,950 --> 00:17:57,540
Ahh, Hyung, you're so frustrating. You're so frustrating, Hyung.

253
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,460
A CEO should have some charisma.

254
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,830
The moment that you feel that your dignity and stature is being violated in the slightest bit,

255
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:07,250
you should fire  him right away, whether he's the ace or not.

256
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:11,570
That way, he'll be afraid of you and respect you.

257
00:18:14,990 --> 00:18:16,370
Why? Are you upset?

258
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,020
A little bit.

259
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:22,320
But now that you've said it, your words kind of make sense. I'm the CEO of a large law firm.

260
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:27,120
I can't lose my dignity and stature because of an employee like that.

261
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,450
I'll have to call Lawyer Kwon and give him a huge scolding.

262
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:33,990
Even if it smells bloody, I'm resolved to make a change.

263
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,170
That's it.

264
00:18:37,970 --> 00:18:41,290
- Omo. Aigoo.
  Min Ji 

265
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:43,090
Hey, Min Ji.

266
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:45,660
Min Ji? Min Ji? That Min Ji? The nation's first love?

267
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,340
What's up?

268
00:18:47,340 --> 00:18:48,570
What happened at the filming site this time?

269
00:18:48,570 --> 00:18:49,800
What?

270
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,790
Why would we get another filming site?

271
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:54,340
Hey, is a film shoot folding origami?

272
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,760
Hey, when did I get annoyed with you?

273
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,880
Y-Your contract renewal? You're not going to—?

274
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,790
Hey, Min Ji. What are you saying here?

275
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:11,160
Minji.  When I re-consider, you deserve to be angry.

276
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,180
Yeah. You must have been really displeased.

277
00:19:13,180 --> 00:19:16,080
I'll call the director and give him an earful.

278
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,600
So let's continue on quietly. Huh?

279
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:21,190
Pig intestines? Alright, let's eat them. Let's eat them.

280
00:19:21,190 --> 00:19:23,630
And I didn't get annoyed with you earlier.

281
00:19:23,630 --> 00:19:27,270
I had some phlegm stuck in my throat, so I was just clearing it.

282
00:19:27,270 --> 00:19:30,030
That's what happened. Don't misunderstand me.

283
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:35,190
All right Min Ji.  Min Ji, good luck! Yeah. Go on home.

284
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:40,310
Ah, the phlegm...

285
00:19:45,740 --> 00:19:48,170
You're totally dignified right now.

286
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:53,740
If you have been dignified only two times, you should get on your knees when you answer the phone.

287
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,360
- Why? Are you displeased?
 - No, well.

288
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:59,220
Work isn't easy.

289
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:03,020
I was just passing by to say hi and let you know how Yoon Seo was doing.

290
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:05,890
If I stay any longer I think I'll see something I don't want to, so I'm heading out first.

291
00:20:05,890 --> 00:20:08,310
Alright, Hyung. Head on out.

292
00:20:10,860 --> 00:20:12,250
What?

293
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:17,680
Why do I dislike it so much when you call me Hyung?

294
00:20:17,680 --> 00:20:21,490
It doesn't matter when it's just the two of us. You can call me Hyung as much as you want when it's just us two.

295
00:20:21,490 --> 00:20:26,040
But how do you think that I'd feel if you called me Hyung like this around a bunch of other people with that face?

296
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:31,270
Hyung, I've been to the dermatologist so many times before but do you know what he said?

297
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:33,010
He told me to go around wearing a school uniform.

298
00:20:33,010 --> 00:20:35,420
Look at me. My skin is like honey.

299
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:37,740
You've really hurt me.

300
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:41,350
Ah, I just imagined you wearing a school uniform and got goosebumps.

301
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:45,080
It's not about your skin.  I think you need to see an Otolaryngologist because you are hearing voices.

302
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:46,360
I'm going.

303
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,770
Yes, Hyung, head on— Wait, Hyung, one second! One second.

304
00:20:48,770 --> 00:20:52,100
This, what is this.  This is a gift of macaroons.

305
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:56,410
You can take them and share them with your company employees or do whatever you want with them.

306
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,650
That's so out of the blue.

307
00:20:58,650 --> 00:21:00,880
Bye, Hyung.

308
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:06,620
Enjoy your meal.

309
00:21:18,070 --> 00:21:22,260
Oh, this looks so good!

310
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,960
Are you really going to eat all this?

311
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:27,100
I should eat all that I can since you're buying.

312
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:31,530
I'm going to get revenge on you for being rude to me, even if it's just through this.

313
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,890
Action!

314
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:46,000
By the way, you did that on purpose, didn't you?

315
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:48,850
- What?
 - Dressing me in this earlier.

316
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,320
You did it on purpose.

317
00:21:52,500 --> 00:21:54,710
I'm not sure what you're saying.

318
00:21:54,710 --> 00:21:59,590
As I told you earlier, Sunbae is a huge fan of yours, Oh Jin Sim. So that you wouldn't get caught, I—

319
00:21:59,590 --> 00:22:03,900
If you were worried about that, you shouldn't have taken me there in the first place.

320
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:06,030
The more that I think about it, it's strange.

321
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:11,370
You could have just not taken me at all in the first place. Why did you have to take me and make up such a dramatic scenario?

322
00:22:11,370 --> 00:22:16,460
You did it to draw his gaze to me, didn't you? What in the world are you trying to do?

323
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,920
To be honest, that Sunbae is a famous person in this industry.

324
00:22:21,920 --> 00:22:25,160
He's famous for using  his cordial personality and pretending to be gentle and friendly

325
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:27,820
to draw information from the other person.

326
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,950
There are a lot of lawyers who have been fooled by him.

327
00:22:29,950 --> 00:22:33,670
As expected. I knew that he was a bad person.

328
00:22:33,670 --> 00:22:36,620
However, he's easily distracted.

329
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:39,330
He's strong with one-on-one meetings, but if there is more than one person,

330
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:43,450
if there's something that draws his attention, he might say something accidentally.

331
00:22:43,450 --> 00:22:47,380
So you brought me with you? To draw his attention elsewhere?

332
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:52,590
I also did it to give you work.

333
00:22:52,590 --> 00:22:56,260
But yes, that's also a reason. I'm sorry for not telling you in advance.

334
00:22:56,260 --> 00:23:00,490
I was wondering whether I should tell you, but I was worried that you would act badly and awkwardly if you knew.

335
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,530
What did you say? Act badly?

336
00:23:04,530 --> 00:23:08,330
People say that. That you're bad at acting.

337
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:10,950
Ah, I can't believe this.

338
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:14,700
This is my first time hearing that.

339
00:23:14,700 --> 00:23:17,720
I can sue for defamation of character, can't I?

340
00:23:18,930 --> 00:23:21,200
You can, but...

341
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:25,830
Then are you saying that you're going to sue the entire nation?

342
00:23:25,830 --> 00:23:27,630
What did you say?

343
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:31,980
Forget it!

344
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:40,090
- This is my schedule for the week. 
  - Did you do it all?

345
00:23:40,090 --> 00:23:42,060
La la la la. Alright,

346
00:23:43,230 --> 00:23:45,150
everyone's (blood) sugar is dropping, right?

347
00:23:45,150 --> 00:23:47,200
I brought macarons as dessert.

348
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,270
Oh, this is my favorite dessert.

349
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:53,560
It has my favorite strawberry flavor.

350
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,110
I don't want any.

351
00:23:56,110 --> 00:23:59,560
Why? I thought that you would like it the most.

352
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:02,160
Now that I'm looking at you, why are you so listless?

353
00:24:02,160 --> 00:24:05,710
She was rejected by the part-timer at the sandwich shop.

354
00:24:05,710 --> 00:24:07,610
And here I thought it was something...

355
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:09,630
You've been rejected by the second son of the soupbone restaurant,

356
00:24:09,630 --> 00:24:13,610
the Italian restaurant chef, and the boss of the meat restaurant.

357
00:24:13,610 --> 00:24:15,980
You've been rejected endlessly.

358
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:19,670
Every single time, you've always forgotten about it right away and started liking someone else. So what?

359
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:25,940
This time was different. I was really in love this time.

360
00:24:25,940 --> 00:24:30,310
I... can't fall in love again.

361
00:24:30,310 --> 00:24:33,220
I'm sorry. I think I made a mistake.

362
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:35,800
Lawyer Dan Moon Hui.

363
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:42,390
♫  From the moment I saw you  ♫

364
00:24:42,390 --> 00:24:45,120
♫  Saw you baby  ♫

365
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:49,340
♫  You were something to behold  ♫

366
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:51,360
That's me.

367
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,340
Ah, yes. Please take this.

368
00:24:54,340 --> 00:24:56,820
Yes.

369
00:24:56,820 --> 00:25:00,720
Please sign here.

370
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,650
- Yes, right here.
 - Ah, yes.

371
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:08,630
Alright. Keep up the good work.

372
00:25:08,630 --> 00:25:10,400
Thank you.

373
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:12,540
One moment!

374
00:25:12,540 --> 00:25:17,110
Your sugar must be low because you're running around like lightning. Eat one of these before you leave!

375
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:21,070
♫  I can't be without your love  ♫

376
00:25:21,070 --> 00:25:24,350
She fell in love like lighting with the delievery man.

377
00:25:24,350 --> 00:25:27,000
Isn't she too fast?

378
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,650
Well, let's eat.

379
00:25:28,650 --> 00:25:30,990
Oh, Lawyer Kwon! Come here.

380
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,420
Ah, yes.

381
00:25:33,500 --> 00:25:37,280
Didn't you go with Yoon Seo earlier? What happened to her?

382
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,050
- She went to the prosecutor's office.
 - What?!

383
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:42,150
Did Yoon Seo get arrested again?

384
00:25:42,150 --> 00:25:44,780
That's not it. She went to copy some case records.

385
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:48,950
Ah, you shocked me. Then you should have said it like that! You made me...

386
00:25:49,930 --> 00:25:53,730
Wait. Yoon Seo is already searching for and copying case records?

387
00:25:53,730 --> 00:25:55,400
- Yes.
 - Wow.

388
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,310
She's already become that professional?

389
00:25:58,310 --> 00:26:01,920
My goodness. Our Oh Yeon Soo is always firing on all cylinders.

390
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:04,650
That's so touching. She's so impressive. So impressive.

391
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:07,930
She'll end up opening her own lawyer's office at this rate.

392
00:26:10,610 --> 00:26:13,160
The bone soup was really good today.

393
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:16,900
Yes, it's perfect for cold weather. Let's go again next time.

394
00:26:16,900 --> 00:26:20,590
- Victims of the political organization! 
 - Victims of the political organization!

395
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:24,290
- What investigation with detention are you talking about? 
 - What investigation with detention are you talking about?

396
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,250
Acknowledge that it was self-defense! 
 A brazen wife beater.  Judicial system wake up!

397
00:26:26,250 --> 00:26:30,680
Chairman, I said this to you earlier, but can you give that case to me?

398
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,310
Why? It's in the daily news.

399
00:26:33,310 --> 00:26:35,930
Do you want it because it's receiving attention from the media?

400
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:37,610
No, that's not it.

401
00:26:37,610 --> 00:26:41,280
It's because I feel that it's suspicious that both her late husband and her ex-husband both died.

402
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:44,380
What do you mean, suspicious? Let's hurry up and go.

403
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:48,430
- Victims of the political organization! 
- Victims of the political organization!

404
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:52,110
- What investigation with detention are you talking about? 
 - What investigation with detention are you talking about?

405
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:56,090
- Acknowledge that it was self-defense! 
- Acknowledge that it was self-defense!

406
00:26:56,090 --> 00:26:58,640
Mr. Lawyer, I found the case records that you wanted

407
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:01,880
and copied them. I sent them to you through email, perfectly.

408
00:27:01,880 --> 00:27:04,880
 Good job. You worked hard in various ways today. 

409
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:07,270
 You can get off work now. 

410
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:10,230
- Get off work?
  - Yes. Then. 

411
00:27:11,380 --> 00:27:13,670
It's only three o'clock.

412
00:27:13,670 --> 00:27:16,190
Is it really okay for me to just go?

413
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,020
It would be nice to watch a trial since I'm already here.

414
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,910
Then you can just watch one.

415
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,050
You surprised me!

416
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,880
Yoon Seo, who do you call when a fire breaks out?

417
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,420
What? Um, a firefighter?

418
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,940
- Then, if something is stolen?
 - The police.

419
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:35,560
Then, when you find something that you want?

420
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,640
Um, I... What?

421
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:41,100
None other than me! You just have to look for me, Choi Yoon Hyeok.

422
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:44,440
I actually have a trial right now. A pro bono trial.

423
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:46,660
It's a case ordinarily assigned to a public defender.

424
00:27:46,660 --> 00:27:48,790
Pono bono?

425
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,220
Pro bono.

426
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:54,340
For the socially weak people in poor situations that have difficulties hiring a lawyer,

427
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,120
I defend them for free. It's like doing volunteer work.

428
00:27:58,780 --> 00:28:03,250
Shall I call it noblesse oblige?

429
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:15,680
- Um, wearing sunglasses is prohibited in court. 
- Ah.

430
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,240
Yes.

431
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:21,570
That's right. It's illegal to cover your face in here.

432
00:28:23,970 --> 00:28:28,780
The regulations are strict, aren't they? That's why everyone gets nervous when they come to the courtroom.

433
00:28:28,780 --> 00:28:32,480
Rather than being nervous, my heart is fluttering a lot!

434
00:28:33,310 --> 00:28:35,640
Your heart is fluttering, you said?

435
00:28:37,820 --> 00:28:40,480
It must be because I'm beside you.

436
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,730
That's not it. Yesterday, I watched a court drama.

437
00:28:46,730 --> 00:28:48,240
It was so cool!

438
00:28:48,240 --> 00:28:53,200
But when I think that I'll be seeing it in person, I feel so excited!

439
00:28:54,210 --> 00:28:56,350
Everyone rise.

440
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:58,050
Stand up. Up.

441
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:04,680
 Prosecutor's Seat 

442
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:08,620
While parking, the defendant got angry and fought with the victim.

443
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:10,350
With his right hand, he inflicted injuries on the victim

444
00:29:10,350 --> 00:29:13,100
in the face and chest several times

445
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:16,840
which required medical treatment for eight weeks.

446
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:19,880
What do you think about this statement, Defendant?

447
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,620
I feel really wronged!

448
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:24,030
That person threw a punch first!

449
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:27,180
Even if he threw the first punch, if he required treatment for 8 weeks,

450
00:29:27,180 --> 00:29:29,580
then you will receive a penalty.

451
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,560
First punch?

452
00:29:32,950 --> 00:29:36,180
The defendant Kim Yoo Na bragged about her close friendship

453
00:29:36,180 --> 00:29:40,300
with Ji Yong, a famous idol from Group XTeen to the victims Park Ho Ran and Son Min Ah,

454
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:42,180
and defrauded them, saying that she would get his autograph.

455
00:29:42,180 --> 00:29:46,600
In return, she obtained by fraud a total of 530,000 won.

456
00:29:46,600 --> 00:29:48,830
Defendant, do you acknowledge this statement?

457
00:29:48,830 --> 00:29:51,170
Yes, I acknowledge it.

458
00:29:51,170 --> 00:29:54,940
If you don't enter into a settlement with the victims, it will be difficult to treat you leniently.

459
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,190
- I already settled with them though.
 - Really?

460
00:29:58,190 --> 00:30:00,580
There's no letter of agreement, though.

461
00:30:00,580 --> 00:30:05,500
Looking at it, the victims said that they couldn't reach a settlement because they didn't get their payment back.

462
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,710
They asked us to give you a penalty.

463
00:30:07,710 --> 00:30:10,400
I paid them back but I didn't do everything.

464
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:15,670
So you're saying you only paid back a part. How much did you pay, and to whom?

465
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:18,620
I'm not sure. I don't really remember.

466
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:23,020
What's with that? Isn't she lying to the judge?

467
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,130
That's right. Ah.

468
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:27,870
The quality of the trials is really...

469
00:30:27,870 --> 00:30:30,120
Look at the next trial closely.

470
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:33,480
There will be a lawyer who asks questions with sharp insight.

471
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:35,670
It's my turn.

472
00:30:42,770 --> 00:30:47,340
Your Honor, the defendant raised two children by herself.

473
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:49,720
One moment.

474
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:52,680
It says right here that she has no children.

475
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,300
What?

476
00:30:55,290 --> 00:30:57,380
- You said that you have children.
 - Ah.

477
00:30:57,380 --> 00:31:02,390
I was talking about my cats.  They are like my own children!

478
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:13,290
Anyway, my respected judge,

479
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:19,890
While the defendant ...  all by herself ... raised two cats,

480
00:31:19,890 --> 00:31:23,440
supporting them with the utmost devotion of a single mother,

481
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:26,020
she was known throughout her neighborhood as an intensely filial person.

482
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:30,150
A defendant as kind as that had a single moment of bad judgment.

483
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,840
No! I told you, I didn't make a wrong decision!

484
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:35,710
It's not my fault.

485
00:31:35,710 --> 00:31:38,220
I told you, I can't admit fault!

486
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:44,700
Please, please just stay still.

487
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:56,870
- Yoon Seo.
 - Yes? 
- I lost my case today,

488
00:31:56,870 --> 00:31:59,810
but I actually didn't lose.

489
00:32:00,660 --> 00:32:03,680
- What?
 - The client that I was defending was in the wrong.

490
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:07,150
Since a person like that was punished, justice was served in the end.

491
00:32:07,150 --> 00:32:09,250
I lost, but because justice prevailed,

492
00:32:09,250 --> 00:32:11,510
I didn't actually lose.

493
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,550
What are you saying?

494
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:20,110
Anyway, I need to speak with my client.

495
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:23,340
- Go ahead, quickly.
 - Yes, I will see you at the law firm.

496
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:34,490
Just because they're called lawyers doesn't mean that they're as skillful

497
00:32:34,490 --> 00:32:38,390
and charismatic as my lawyer... Oh my, oh my, oh my! What am I saying right now?

498
00:32:38,390 --> 00:32:42,350
 My  lawyer? I must be crazy. I must be insane.

499
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:51,590
- Yes.
  - Noona, it's me, your road manager. I'm in front of the courthouse. 

500
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:53,560
  Please come out to the entrance. 

501
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,340
Wait just a moment.

502
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:59,650
 Do you need coffee or anything? I'll buy it for you. 

503
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,570
No, I don't need anything.

504
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:06,970
One moment! There's probably a bookstore out front.

505
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,080
Buy me a book from there.

506
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:11,280
It doesn't matter if it's civil law or criminal law.

507
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:14,390
Buy all of the law books that you can.

508
00:33:16,910 --> 00:33:19,760
 Heights Mansion 

509
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,710
 Prosecution of Crime 
 Inegrated Civil Law 

510
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,410
 I checked the email. You worked hard. 

511
00:33:40,410 --> 00:33:45,870
Wow. He also sends his kakaotalk messages so stiffly.

512
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:59,100
 Mr. Lawyer! I bought books to study about law again. 

513
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:01,010
 Worth 128,000 won. 

514
00:34:01,010 --> 00:34:05,360
 I'll study hard and become a helpful secretary to you! 

515
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,860
We got a case just for you, Lawyer Kwon.

516
00:34:21,860 --> 00:34:24,800
This is the public defender case that you requested last month.

517
00:34:26,500 --> 00:34:29,460
What was his name? Ji Yong of XTeen? Anyway, a female high school student

518
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:34,020
said that she would get his autograph and got money from her friends but didn't deliver.

519
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:36,190
She's still young, so it's a bit much for her to receive a penalty.

520
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,350
Look into it for me, Lawyer Kwon.

521
00:34:38,350 --> 00:34:40,020
Alright.

522
00:34:40,790 --> 00:34:42,800
You're telling me to get a written statement?

523
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:45,530
That way we can ask for leniency.

524
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:48,780
But I went with Lawyer Choi to watch trials yesterday

525
00:34:48,780 --> 00:34:52,820
and happened to see her trial. She's definitely guilty.

526
00:34:52,820 --> 00:34:55,390
It's the judge's job to judge whether she's guilty or innocent.

527
00:34:55,390 --> 00:34:58,120
My job is to defend my client.

528
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,010
But she scammed people and lied to the judge.

529
00:35:02,010 --> 00:35:04,780
She's really bad.

530
00:35:05,990 --> 00:35:09,940
Do you think that it's possible to only defend people who haven't committed a crime?

531
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:11,640
That's not it, but...

532
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:14,220
I already spoke with Secretary Yang, so head there.

533
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:17,010
Yes, sir. I understand.

534
00:35:19,330 --> 00:35:21,620
 Mom, I left school early. I think I have a cold. I have a headache, maybe a fever, too. I will be home. 

535
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,100
Um, Secretary Yang?

536
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,240
Lawyer Kwon wants us to go get a written statement together.

537
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,010
When shall we leave?

538
00:35:35,010 --> 00:35:38,600
What should I do? My daughter just got in touch with me,

539
00:35:38,600 --> 00:35:41,150
and she said that she's down with the flu.

540
00:35:41,150 --> 00:35:43,870
There's no one to take care of her but me,

541
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,990
so I think I have to tell the CEO and go home.

542
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:49,710
Then you should go.

543
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,370
What should I do about the written statement?

544
00:35:52,370 --> 00:35:53,940
Go with me.

545
00:35:53,940 --> 00:35:55,410
With you, Office Manager?

546
00:35:55,410 --> 00:35:59,480
Yes. When I was a detective, I received a lot of written statements.

547
00:36:00,660 --> 00:36:03,340
I'll go with her, so you can hurry and go.

548
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,760
Thank you, Office Manager.

549
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:14,020
This is your case.

550
00:36:14,020 --> 00:36:16,210
It's the case of the wife who murdered her abusive husband. You recognize it, right?

551
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:19,880
Weren't you going to assign this to Sunbae Im?

552
00:36:19,880 --> 00:36:21,830
Is it because of the group of women, perhaps?

553
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:25,730
That's right. They're already calling it a witch hunt.

554
00:36:25,730 --> 00:36:29,520
The superiors have decided that it would look the best if you took on the case, Prosecutor Yoo.

555
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:31,630
I also think the same.

556
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:34,320
- So you mean I'm a shield. 
- So, you don't want it?

557
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:38,490
No. I like it. I was actually interested in this case.

558
00:36:38,490 --> 00:36:40,140
If you solve this case correctly,

559
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:44,530
I will appoint you to the Supreme Prosecutors' Office or the special department. Do well.

560
00:36:44,530 --> 00:36:46,820
I'll do my best.

561
00:36:50,740 --> 00:36:52,160
Hey, Yoo Yeo Reum!

562
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,020
What's going on? Isn't that Prosecutor Im? What's wrong with him?

563
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:56,400
Yes.

564
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:58,990
Hey, you brat with no business ethics.

565
00:36:58,990 --> 00:37:00,540
Do you want to succeed like that?

566
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,040
You want to succeed by taking the case that your sunbae had his heart set on?

567
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,210
As far as I know, this case wasn't assigned to you from the start.

568
00:37:07,210 --> 00:37:08,990
So, you took it first?

569
00:37:08,990 --> 00:37:12,090
As you said, I thought of it as a chance to succeed.

570
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,620
So I just didn't reject the offer.

571
00:37:13,620 --> 00:37:15,440
Hey!

572
00:37:16,340 --> 00:37:18,200
Sunbae, let's stop.

573
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:19,920
Won't you let go?

574
00:37:19,920 --> 00:37:22,100
Did you not hear this woman speaking rudely?

575
00:37:22,100 --> 00:37:25,150
Later. Let's talk later.

576
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:30,830
- What's with him?
 - What's going on?

577
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:36,540
Keep your head on straight.

578
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:39,180
I'm going to be watching you.

579
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,030
Why is Prosecutor Im acting like that?

580
00:37:43,030 --> 00:37:45,090
Ah, seriously, if it was going to be like this...

581
00:37:45,090 --> 00:37:46,880
- Sunbaenim!
 - What's wrong with him?

582
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,990
They say that she took Prosecutor Im's case.

583
00:37:48,990 --> 00:37:52,050
How could she take her Sunbae's case? She really has no conscience.

584
00:37:52,050 --> 00:37:54,930
- Really?
 - Yeah, she's well-known in that sense.

585
00:37:54,930 --> 00:37:58,210
- Wow.
 - I knew that Yoo Yeo Reum would cause trouble.

586
00:37:58,210 --> 00:38:00,980
- She stole his case? 
- Really? Which one?

587
00:38:00,980 --> 00:38:03,010
Ah, that's right. The husband one?

588
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,840
Wow, Yoo Yeo Reum sure is something.

589
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:21,550
Excuse me, Prosecutor.

590
00:38:21,550 --> 00:38:22,850
Yes?

591
00:38:22,850 --> 00:38:25,660
You should eat this if your stomach is feeling upset.

592
00:38:25,660 --> 00:38:27,680
It's a digestive medicine.

593
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:30,140
How did you know?

594
00:38:30,140 --> 00:38:33,890
Prosecutor Kim Se Won gave it to me and left.

595
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:53,410
I don't have much time.

596
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:58,560
This. I heard that you gave it to her for me. I don't need it.

597
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:05,590
Anything else to say?

598
00:39:05,590 --> 00:39:08,550
I'll reject any useless kindness from now on.

599
00:39:08,550 --> 00:39:10,830
We're not in that kind of relationship anymore.

600
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,100
What kind of relationship is that?

601
00:39:16,610 --> 00:39:18,840
You probably don't know this because you're selfish,

602
00:39:18,840 --> 00:39:22,630
but workmates live their lives being that kind to one another.

603
00:39:22,630 --> 00:39:25,640
You make sure that you're not the one misunderstanding our relationship.

604
00:39:25,640 --> 00:39:29,000
I'm not. Don't worry.

605
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:32,810
- Is that all you have to say? 
- Yeah.

606
00:40:05,330 --> 00:40:10,810
Excuse me. You can stay in the car if you feel uncomfortable because someone might recognize you.

607
00:40:10,810 --> 00:40:14,020
I'm okay. I've gone here and there lately,

608
00:40:14,020 --> 00:40:16,860
and I've found that no one recognizes me.

609
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:19,980
Then shall we go to get the written statement?

610
00:40:19,980 --> 00:40:21,680
Yes.

611
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:23,360
What do you mean, a written statement?

612
00:40:23,360 --> 00:40:25,450
I have absolutely no intention of writing something like that!

613
00:40:25,450 --> 00:40:28,280
And do you think that she only lied about the autograph?

614
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:31,460
She said that her grandmother was the most popular shaman in our country.

615
00:40:31,460 --> 00:40:34,950
She said that (shaman) blood runs in her and she will have a ceremony to become one.

616
00:40:34,950 --> 00:40:37,120
But she doesn't have a grandmother.

617
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,060
She said that she was in the last stage of throat cancer.

618
00:40:39,060 --> 00:40:42,260
I was good to her because I pitied her, but I found out that was a lie too.

619
00:40:42,260 --> 00:40:44,840
What she has is a pseudologia fantastica  (pathological lying),  not a throat cancer.

620
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:46,480
A total attention whore!

621
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,680
She said that she was an acting trainee, but that was a lie too.

622
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:56,190
Anyway, I don't like her even if she begs me like this.

623
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,050
But, that...

624
00:41:00,390 --> 00:41:02,630
What is this?

625
00:41:03,250 --> 00:41:06,730
Is it true that you're close to the XTeen member Ji Yong?

626
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,280
You say you're that close, so why didn't you get his autograph?

627
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,030
Well.  Just somehow.

628
00:41:13,030 --> 00:41:15,660
Why did you get money for his autograph and sell it?

629
00:41:15,660 --> 00:41:17,380
I did it because I don't have any money.

630
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:20,260
If you needed money, you could have just told your parents.

631
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,720
I don't have parents, though.

632
00:41:23,220 --> 00:41:26,200
 Family Relation Certificate 

633
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:30,170
Your Family Relationship Certificate states that your parents are still alive.

634
00:41:31,950 --> 00:41:33,440
She's lying again.

635
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:37,390
Returning that money to the victims will help you to gain leniency.

636
00:41:37,390 --> 00:41:39,420
I spent it all, though.

637
00:41:42,170 --> 00:41:45,490
Hey, Student!  Do you think the lawyer is your friend or what?

638
00:41:45,490 --> 00:41:47,860
Why do you keep lying?

639
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:50,100
What are you, Ahjumma?

640
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:54,670
- Oh Yoon Seo?
 - I resemble her a lot, don't I?

641
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:58,360
But I'm not her. I'm not her, I'm not. Don't misunderstand.

642
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:01,070
I saw you at the trial yesterday.

643
00:42:01,070 --> 00:42:05,500
You lied to the judge, didn't you? Furthermore ...

644
00:42:06,220 --> 00:42:08,500
I just came back from meeting your friends,

645
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:11,600
and they all talk about how you fooled them.

646
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:15,140
No matter who hears this or looks at it, you're going to be punished in this situation.

647
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:18,230
This lawyer stepped forward to help you.

648
00:42:18,230 --> 00:42:19,840
Should you act like that toward him?

649
00:42:19,840 --> 00:42:22,470
Just stay out of it, you washed up celebrity.

650
00:42:22,470 --> 00:42:25,370
Washed up... Are you done speaking?!

651
00:42:25,370 --> 00:42:28,940
- What are you doing right now? 
- That's right. What are you doing?!

652
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:30,830
I'm talking about you, Oh Jin Sim!

653
00:42:30,830 --> 00:42:34,110
M-Me? Not her?

654
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:37,500
Your real name was Oh Jin Sim?

655
00:42:37,500 --> 00:42:41,780
It's not Jin Sim. It's not Oh Yoon Seo, either!

656
00:42:50,630 --> 00:42:52,180
Why did you step in back there?

657
00:42:52,180 --> 00:42:54,930
Well, because she kept lying.

658
00:42:54,930 --> 00:42:56,710
The first meeting between a lawyer and a client

659
00:42:56,710 --> 00:43:00,250
is the most crucial part of the process in finding a solution to solve the case.

660
00:43:00,250 --> 00:43:03,420
So why did you butt in and interfere with me finding out the truth?

661
00:43:03,420 --> 00:43:06,490
What do you mean, interfere with you finding out the truth? Couldn't you tell?

662
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:09,590
That girl has no intention of telling the truth.

663
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:13,220
I went to her school, and there's not one of her friends who believes her.

664
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:15,680
Why would they be like that?

665
00:43:15,680 --> 00:43:20,240
I thought that you didn't need to waste your time hearing those kinds of useless lies and—

666
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,020
Accepting a case is none of your business, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

667
00:43:24,020 --> 00:43:25,910
Working hard and overstepping your boundaries are two different things.

668
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:29,580
This is definitely beyond your boundaries, so I wish that you wouldn't step forward anymore.

669
00:43:29,580 --> 00:43:33,230
I did it with you in mind to try and help you.

670
00:43:33,230 --> 00:43:37,090
I'm really upset since you put it that way!

671
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:42,890
Don't behave emotionally.

672
00:43:42,890 --> 00:43:45,910
That kind of attitude isn't helpful at all.

673
00:43:52,550 --> 00:43:55,330
Eat a lot. Don't pick at your food.

674
00:43:55,330 --> 00:43:59,040
They said that eating a lot and resting well are the best for the flu.

675
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:02,350
I ate a lot. I want to go and rest.

676
00:44:02,350 --> 00:44:04,850
Eat a little bit more. Ah.

677
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,880
You have to take your medicine.

678
00:44:11,150 --> 00:44:13,280
Ah, that's right. Water.

679
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,830
Jin Hee, water—

680
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,430
What... are you doing?

681
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:38,950
Here. I copied it as you requested.

682
00:44:40,820 --> 00:44:43,450
There are five copies. I only asked for three.

683
00:44:43,450 --> 00:44:47,550
Oh my, I'm sorry that I acted as I wanted, like you said, and copied more than you asked for.

684
00:44:47,550 --> 00:44:49,300
This is also overstepping my boundaries, right?

685
00:44:49,300 --> 00:44:51,780
I'll be more mindful from now on.

686
00:44:52,840 --> 00:44:54,990
What are you doing right now?

687
00:44:54,990 --> 00:44:58,150
Ah, that's right. You told me not to behave emotionally.

688
00:44:58,150 --> 00:45:01,610
I'm sorry for behaving emotionally on a grudge.

689
00:45:02,090 --> 00:45:05,950
Before you detest me for not getting off work on time, I'll clock out.

690
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,930
Then.

691
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,590
"Then"?

692
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:23,750
Overstepping my boundaries?

693
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,050
He told me not to behave emotionally?

694
00:45:27,510 --> 00:45:30,170
But I did it to help him in whatever way  I could.

695
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,550
 The Criminal Procedure Code 

696
00:45:40,500 --> 00:45:43,540
 Case: 2019GODAN7482 Fraud 
Defendant: Kim Yoon Ha 

697
00:45:43,600 --> 00:45:47,000
  In regard to the case above, I, as an attorney, propose as follows:  

698
00:46:03,960 --> 00:46:06,810
Our new coffee beans are so good!

699
00:46:06,810 --> 00:46:09,270
I don't know. I'm not too sure.

700
00:46:09,270 --> 00:46:13,610
You know, the Viennese Einspänner coffee is the best in the world.

701
00:46:13,610 --> 00:46:17,960
Last Winter, I went to Vienna, feeling blue.

702
00:46:17,960 --> 00:46:22,390
The moment when I took the very first sip of a sweet Einspänner coffee...

703
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:27,060
I still can't forget that feeling.

704
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:35,760
You two seemed to be so calm for the last few days.

705
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:36,840
Did you fight again?

706
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:40,120
No, well, more than us fighting...

707
00:46:40,120 --> 00:46:42,020
Something did happen.

708
00:46:42,770 --> 00:46:45,820
Don't stew over it yourself and spill it, quickly.

709
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,810
No, that is a little...

710
00:46:50,810 --> 00:46:54,260
There's a female high school student that Lawyer Kwon is in charge of.

711
00:46:54,260 --> 00:46:56,940
She was lying to him.

712
00:46:56,940 --> 00:47:00,920
Does it make sense to lie even to the person who's trying to help you?

713
00:47:00,920 --> 00:47:04,510
So as an adult and as Lawyer Kwon's secretary,

714
00:47:04,510 --> 00:47:09,390
I told her that she shouldn't do that. But Lawyer Kwon threw a huge fuss.

715
00:47:09,390 --> 00:47:13,230
My word. I want to tell Lawyer Kwon off.

716
00:47:13,230 --> 00:47:15,080
Lawyer Kwon went too far!

717
00:47:15,080 --> 00:47:18,940
What do you mean? What Lawyer Kwon said is right.

718
00:47:18,940 --> 00:47:23,940
It's not a secretary's place to get in between the conversation between a lawyer and his client.

719
00:47:23,940 --> 00:47:27,290
But why did she say she caused that kind of trouble?

720
00:47:27,290 --> 00:47:29,380
It's probably because she needed money.

721
00:47:29,380 --> 00:47:32,070
She got a public defender, you know. She must be short of  money.

722
00:47:32,070 --> 00:47:34,960
Well, she agreed to come with her parents today,

723
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:37,310
so we'll be able to find something out later.

724
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:47,230
What? She came alone?

725
00:47:49,140 --> 00:47:52,040
I told you to come with your parents.

726
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:54,120
They're very busy with work.

727
00:47:55,970 --> 00:47:58,460
Give me your parents' phone number.

728
00:47:58,460 --> 00:47:59,750
They don't have a phone.

729
00:47:59,750 --> 00:48:02,920
Then at least give me their work numbers. Their company will have a phone.

730
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:04,420
Ah, that's right.

731
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:06,110
They quit yesterday. Goodness.

732
00:48:06,110 --> 00:48:07,460
You—

733
00:48:13,260 --> 00:48:16,520
I don't have anything else to say. I can leave now, right?

734
00:48:18,900 --> 00:48:22,410
If you keep that attitude in the court, you might get a heavier penalty.

735
00:48:22,410 --> 00:48:25,260
Which means, it is possible for you to get convicted and put in a correctional institute.

736
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:29,920
Are you scaring me right now?

737
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:33,260
I'm not scared of something like that at all.

738
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:37,220
You pretending to be strong right now sounds like you're asking me to help you.

739
00:48:37,220 --> 00:48:39,420
- What nonsense—
 - There will be a trial soon.

740
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:42,600
There will be people who have the right to deprive you of freedom.

741
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:46,090
Depending on their decision, you can become a convict.

742
00:48:48,280 --> 00:48:51,250
I'll be the only person who can help you in that trial.

743
00:48:51,250 --> 00:48:55,080
If you want help, you can trust me a little more.

744
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,880
Trust what? Forget it.

745
00:49:09,580 --> 00:49:13,250
Ah, why is she lying so much?

746
00:49:13,250 --> 00:49:15,970
Also, why did she leave the door open?

747
00:49:17,020 --> 00:49:19,100
I can't go on the weekend.

748
00:49:19,100 --> 00:49:22,690
I think I should spend some time with Jin Hee.

749
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,560
I just thought Jin Hee is all grown up and

750
00:49:25,560 --> 00:49:28,580
it was a relief that she is bright and strong, but

751
00:49:29,510 --> 00:49:31,550
I guess she was really lonely this year

752
00:49:31,550 --> 00:49:35,360
because I'm her only family, but I was so busy.

753
00:49:35,360 --> 00:49:38,330
She said she was sick, so  I got off work early to go get her.

754
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:41,260
But I found out that she was lying.

755
00:49:41,260 --> 00:49:44,450
She was pretending to be sick to get my attention.

756
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,260
Attention.

757
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:51,220
Yoo Na? Ah, Kim Yoo Na?

758
00:49:51,220 --> 00:49:54,890
Ah, that's right. She was a trainee at our company until last year.

759
00:49:54,890 --> 00:49:57,880
Really? It's true that she was a trainee?

760
00:49:57,900 --> 00:50:03,700
Yeah. Last year, she didn't make it as the girl group's last member.

761
00:50:03,700 --> 00:50:08,200
So we let her go. She entered the company when she was 14,

762
00:50:08,200 --> 00:50:10,100
so she was here for about five years. You know Ji Yong from XTeen, right?

763
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:13,230
They were classmates, so she was really close to him.

764
00:50:13,230 --> 00:50:18,260
Ji Yong is a case where he moved to JDK Group midway, made his debut, and did well.

765
00:50:18,260 --> 00:50:21,100
Yoo Na is a pretty regretful case.

766
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:24,650
Well, her basics were good,

767
00:50:24,650 --> 00:50:28,920
but her family was bad off. She should have come to practice,

768
00:50:28,920 --> 00:50:31,390
but she was working part-time.  What would she do for five years?

769
00:50:31,390 --> 00:50:34,870
She was getting older. So we had no choice but to let her go.

770
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:37,370
But why are you asking about Yoo Na?

771
00:50:39,060 --> 00:50:40,940
It's nothing.

772
00:50:44,610 --> 00:50:47,620
Did she go astray because she was let go?

773
00:50:48,710 --> 00:50:50,490
You worked hard!

774
00:50:51,870 --> 00:50:55,190
Oppa, you worked hard following me around for the past few days.

775
00:50:55,190 --> 00:50:58,070
You worked hard for the first time in a long time after being in charge of Yoon Seo when she didn't have any work, didn't you?

776
00:50:58,070 --> 00:50:59,990
No. You worked hard.

777
00:50:59,990 --> 00:51:02,300
Oppa, your working style matches with me really well.

778
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:03,810
Can't you just keep following me around?

779
00:51:03,810 --> 00:51:08,200
What are you saying? I've been the one over Yoon Seo for so many years, so why are you saying that?

780
00:51:08,200 --> 00:51:12,700
That's why I'm saying that. Because I think Unni Yoon Seo will keep not having any work in the future.

781
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:15,500
Honestly, I'm saying that actresses meet their end too.

782
00:51:15,500 --> 00:51:17,660
Her image has already dropped as low as it can drop.

783
00:51:17,660 --> 00:51:20,190
It'll be really tough for her to renew her contract.

784
00:51:20,190 --> 00:51:22,420
Hey, Kim Min Ji!

785
00:51:23,510 --> 00:51:25,430
Yoo-Yoo-Yoon Seo!

786
00:51:27,330 --> 00:51:30,170
Omo, Unni. Long time, no see.

787
00:51:30,170 --> 00:51:35,260
Don't be too bothered about what I just said. I said it because it would be such a waste to leave Oppa Hyeok Joon like this.

788
00:51:35,260 --> 00:51:39,280
Honestly, the whole nation knows that you're at rock bottom,

789
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,400
so what if Oppa also hits rock bottom while staying with you?

790
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,130
Isn't that right?

791
00:51:45,600 --> 00:51:49,210
Omo, I have to have a concept meeting for my commercial shoot.

792
00:51:49,210 --> 00:51:54,120
Unni, you were also busy at one time, so you understand, right?

793
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,440
Hey! What are you doing right now?

794
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,920
Why are you doing this? Is this Unni crazy?

795
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:06,060
That's right, I'm crazy.

796
00:52:06,060 --> 00:52:09,420
How can I be in my right mind when you are openly looking down at me?!

797
00:52:09,420 --> 00:52:10,740
Hey, Yoon Seo!

798
00:52:10,740 --> 00:52:13,530
Ah, seriously. You really—

799
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,820
- Hey, why are you doing this?
 - Hey, stop!

800
00:52:15,820 --> 00:52:18,330
- What are you doing? 
- Are you crazy? They must be crazy!

801
00:52:18,330 --> 00:52:20,710
Hey!

802
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,220
Don't take any pictures! Don't take pictures!

803
00:52:23,220 --> 00:52:25,820
No, no!

804
00:52:26,520 --> 00:52:28,130
Hey! Let this go!

805
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:29,490
Hey!

806
00:52:29,490 --> 00:52:31,110
- Won't you let go?!
 - Hey, calm down!

807
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,760
You're dead today!

808
00:52:48,730 --> 00:52:51,070
Wow, the view is great.

809
00:52:51,070 --> 00:52:55,870
Since we're in a place that's all open, it makes your heart feel calm and everything, doesn't it?

810
00:52:55,870 --> 00:52:57,400
It doesn't, right?

811
00:53:00,070 --> 00:53:03,390
Yoon Seo, I'll hurry up and go buy you a cup of sweet coffee.

812
00:53:03,390 --> 00:53:07,510
Your mood gets better when you have something sweet. Wait just for a moment!

813
00:53:56,370 --> 00:54:00,180
Yoon Seo, wouldn't it be better to just go home?

814
00:54:00,180 --> 00:54:02,800
Let's just tell the law firm that you're sick.

815
00:54:02,800 --> 00:54:05,110
If you go in this condition, you'll—

816
00:54:05,110 --> 00:54:08,480
No. I'm okay now.

817
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:16,160
Oppa.

818
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:22,560
I'm going to finish this three-month project well, no matter what.

819
00:54:24,410 --> 00:54:28,240
And I'm going to make a comeback as an actress.

820
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,490
Proudly.

821
00:54:33,190 --> 00:54:35,070
- And, Oppa.
 - Hm?

822
00:54:36,580 --> 00:54:39,420
Don't lie to me from now on.

823
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:43,430
I'll forgive you once, but there is no second time. Got it?

824
00:54:43,430 --> 00:54:45,910
Of course, I got it.

825
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,730
I'll do well.

826
00:55:08,730 --> 00:55:10,240
Yes, Prosecutor?

827
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:11,940
Yes, Yoo Na got in touch with me.

828
00:55:11,990 --> 00:55:14,650
I'm on my way to the police station now.

829
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,100
What do you mean, the police station? Did something happen to Yoo Na?

830
00:55:19,100 --> 00:55:22,170
She was reported to the police by one of the victim's mothers, so she's at the police station.

831
00:55:22,170 --> 00:55:24,040
You can clock out.

832
00:55:24,040 --> 00:55:27,060
I'll go, too. Let's go together.

833
00:55:27,060 --> 00:55:28,970
Okay. Let's go.

834
00:55:39,320 --> 00:55:41,610
 Seoul City Police Station 

835
00:55:42,240 --> 00:55:47,990
But why did she call you instead of her parents?

836
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:50,690
They said that Yoo Na's parents cut off contact with her several years ago.

837
00:55:50,690 --> 00:55:53,080
What? Cut off contact?

838
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:57,510
Her mother ran away when Yoo Na was young, and her father has also been unreachable recently.

839
00:56:02,060 --> 00:56:05,470
There are a lot of people here, so just wait here.

840
00:56:05,470 --> 00:56:09,010
Ah. Okay.

841
00:56:09,050 --> 00:56:10,970
One moment!

842
00:56:11,010 --> 00:56:13,400
It's true that she was an acting trainee,

843
00:56:13,400 --> 00:56:15,860
and it's also true that she knows Ji Yong.

844
00:56:15,860 --> 00:56:20,060
So, she's not that bad a kid.

845
00:56:20,080 --> 00:56:22,990
So please take care of her.

846
00:56:23,910 --> 00:56:27,390
 Traffic accident investigation - General Civil Rights Office 

847
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,670
 Trusted police. Police for the people. 

848
00:56:35,130 --> 00:56:39,670
- So please just calm down for a moment!
 - No, I don't need it!

849
00:56:39,670 --> 00:56:41,730
Hurry up and lock her up.

850
00:56:41,730 --> 00:56:45,440
I'm Kim Yoo Na's Lawyer, Kwon Jeong Rok. What is going on?

851
00:56:45,440 --> 00:56:49,480
Well, this girl came to our house and caused a disturbance.

852
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:52,950
It wasn't a disturbance. I came to apologize to Min Ah.

853
00:56:53,000 --> 00:56:57,620
Omo, girl. If the other party feels like it's a disturbance, then you caused a disturbance.

854
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:01,370
You came as you pleased because you wanted to get a settlement agreement. How laughable.

855
00:57:01,370 --> 00:57:04,430
I heard that you live without any parents.

856
00:57:04,430 --> 00:57:09,400
Is it because you didn't have an example to learn from? You lack even the basics.

857
00:57:09,400 --> 00:57:11,320
Watch your words.

858
00:57:11,320 --> 00:57:14,430
- The words that you just said are considered a crime of contempt. 
- What?

859
00:57:14,430 --> 00:57:19,180
Also, going to someone to apologize and causing a disturbance are two vastly different things.

860
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,850
If she went to apologize and you report  to the police that she caused a disturbance,

861
00:57:21,850 --> 00:57:24,310
you can be charged with making a false accusation.

862
00:57:24,320 --> 00:57:27,120
But, why are you arguing so fiercely?

863
00:57:27,120 --> 00:57:32,170
What words can you not say when you're angry? Would I speak like that if it wasn't bad?

864
00:57:32,170 --> 00:57:34,230
You know that she's a scammer, right?

865
00:57:34,280 --> 00:57:38,880
She lied and said that she was close to some celebrity to try and filched some money off of my child.

866
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:41,500
Her verdict of scammer hasn't even been confirmed yet,

867
00:57:41,500 --> 00:57:46,210
so if you go around calling her a scammer, that is considered defamation of character.

868
00:57:46,210 --> 00:57:49,500
Why is he calling everything I say a crime as soon as I say something?

869
00:57:49,520 --> 00:57:52,130
Mr. Detective, this case is in the middle of trial,

870
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:54,710
so I don't think there's anything else to investigate here at the police station.

871
00:57:54,710 --> 00:57:56,750
And it seems as if this woman reported wrongly.

872
00:57:56,750 --> 00:58:00,980
Anyway, you brought Yoon Ah as a voluntary accompaniment. I will take her with me.

873
00:58:00,980 --> 00:58:03,940
- Do that.
 - Yes, sir.

874
00:58:26,110 --> 00:58:28,820
What happened? Did things get resolved well?

875
00:58:28,820 --> 00:58:31,540
Are you okay?

876
00:58:42,390 --> 00:58:44,690
Eat heartily.

877
00:58:44,690 --> 00:58:47,270
I told you that I don't have an appetite.

878
00:58:47,270 --> 00:58:49,800
This is a call from an important client, so...

879
00:58:49,800 --> 00:58:51,170
Yes?

880
00:58:57,680 --> 00:59:00,340
Why are you looking at me like that?

881
00:59:01,750 --> 00:59:05,590
Yoo Na. You're going through a hard time, aren't you?

882
00:59:07,590 --> 00:59:12,670
Because you're going through a hard time and are lonely, you lied. Right?

883
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,590
Because you wanted to be loved.

884
00:59:14,590 --> 00:59:17,440
What are you saying? So corny.

885
00:59:17,440 --> 00:59:22,800
Why? Is it embarrassing to want to feel loved?

886
00:59:33,460 --> 00:59:36,050
Yeah, that's right.

887
00:59:36,050 --> 00:59:37,880
I'm Oh Yoon Seo.

888
00:59:37,880 --> 00:59:41,870
As you said, I'm a washed-up celebrity.

889
00:59:41,870 --> 00:59:42,970
That...

890
00:59:42,970 --> 00:59:47,100
People look at me and say that I'm a has-been

891
00:59:47,150 --> 00:59:50,030
and that it'll be hard for me to renew my contract.

892
00:59:50,070 --> 00:59:52,690
They say that I'm at rock bottom.

893
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:56,930
But I

894
00:59:58,410 --> 01:00:01,840
want to be loved like I was before.

895
01:00:02,590 --> 01:00:06,660
I want to go back to the place where I shone the brightest.

896
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:09,070
Is it embarrassing for me to feel this way?

897
01:00:09,070 --> 01:00:11,750
No. Well...

898
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:17,890
I think I know how you feel.

899
01:00:17,890 --> 01:00:22,560
You ran ahead just looking forward to your debut, but you got pushed out of that world.

900
01:00:23,500 --> 01:00:27,270
And you feel hopeless as if everything has ended.

901
01:00:28,490 --> 01:00:33,490
And you're lonely because it feels like there's no one in the world on your side.

902
01:00:36,190 --> 01:00:39,270
But Yoo Na,

903
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:42,110
I wish that you wouldn't mistreat yourself.

904
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,800
You doing this right now

905
01:00:44,800 --> 01:00:50,560
is harming you the most, not anyone else.

906
01:01:00,130 --> 01:01:04,020
Did I say something unnecessary?

907
01:01:04,020 --> 01:01:08,500
I was scared, to be honest.

908
01:01:12,810 --> 01:01:16,340
Because if I told the truth about myself,

909
01:01:17,570 --> 01:01:20,670
I thought I wouldn't be loved.

910
01:01:20,670 --> 01:01:23,710
So I ended up lying,

911
01:01:26,250 --> 01:01:33,680
but at some point, those lies gradually grew beyond my control.

912
01:01:34,980 --> 01:01:38,720
No, it's not too late to turn things around.

913
01:01:38,760 --> 01:01:43,070
So never lose yourself.

914
01:01:43,120 --> 01:01:44,930
I'm sorry.

915
01:01:44,980 --> 01:01:47,640
I was wrong.

916
01:01:57,790 --> 01:02:00,220
Don't cry.

917
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:23,270
The Defendant Kim Yoo Na is charged with fraud according to Article 347 of the Criminal Code.

918
01:02:23,270 --> 01:02:26,250
Does the lawyer agree with this statement?

919
01:02:27,080 --> 01:02:30,310
I deny all charges.

920
01:02:31,730 --> 01:02:34,640
The Defendant pleads not guilty.

921
01:02:34,640 --> 01:02:38,520
The defendant admitted to every accusation at the last trial,

922
01:02:38,520 --> 01:02:40,810
so why do you contest that she is innocent?

923
01:02:40,860 --> 01:02:43,990
Fraud is the crime of intentional deception for personal gain, or

924
01:02:43,990 --> 01:02:47,540
obtaining illegal gain from the property belonging to another.

925
01:02:47,540 --> 01:02:51,200
However, the defendant didn't have one of the major elements of fraud,

926
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:54,600
which is an intent to deceive.

927
01:02:54,610 --> 01:02:58,850
The defendant actually was a trainee and was at the same trainee dorm at the same time

928
01:02:58,850 --> 01:03:04,030
as the XTeen member Ji Yong and trained along with him, so she knew him very well.

929
01:03:04,030 --> 01:03:08,000
The defendant also promised the victims that she would get the aforementioned idol's autograph

930
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,030
because she believed that it would be possible to do so

931
01:03:10,030 --> 01:03:13,720
due to her close relationship with him.

932
01:03:13,720 --> 01:03:17,170
Accordingly, the defendant has not committed fraud,

933
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:20,160
so I argue that she is not guilty.

934
01:03:26,490 --> 01:03:29,880
Will she really be declared not guilty?

935
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,700
I think that it's pretty much definite.

936
01:03:34,260 --> 01:03:37,150
I just thought of reducing her sentence in any way possible.

937
01:03:37,200 --> 01:03:42,140
But you found a way to make her not guilty... You're really amazing.

938
01:03:51,100 --> 01:03:52,690
I'm sorry.

939
01:03:52,690 --> 01:03:53,960
What?

940
01:03:54,010 --> 01:03:57,090
Back then,  I told you not to act emotionally

941
01:03:57,090 --> 01:04:02,260
and that that kind of behavior is not helpful. I apologize for saying that.

942
01:04:04,100 --> 01:04:08,470
Thanks to your emotional behavior, Yoo Na's heart was moved.

943
01:04:08,470 --> 01:04:11,740
Ah... What about it?

944
01:04:11,740 --> 01:04:14,930
You did well, Oh Jin Sim.

945
01:04:17,870 --> 01:04:23,260
♫  Time, time is mystical  ♫

946
01:04:23,260 --> 01:04:25,920
♫  You regret after it has passed.  ♫

947
01:04:25,920 --> 01:04:28,050
♫  Oh, it's sad.  ♫

948
01:04:28,050 --> 01:04:30,470
Please say it one more time.

949
01:04:30,470 --> 01:04:34,310
♫  When a sweet dream wakes you up even if its clear,  ♫

950
01:04:34,310 --> 01:04:36,470
What?

951
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:40,120
I'm asking you to compliment me again.

952
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:43,220
What you just said... I'm saying that it made me really happy.

953
01:04:43,220 --> 01:04:45,900
♫  Here you and me  ♫

954
01:04:45,900 --> 01:04:48,420
Say it one more time, please.

955
01:04:48,420 --> 01:04:53,570
♫  I'm trying to put and hold in a place deep in my heart  ♫

956
01:04:53,570 --> 01:04:56,310
♫  The touch of one hand comfortably over another  ♫

957
01:04:56,310 --> 01:05:01,490
♫  today's air also   ♫

958
01:05:01,490 --> 01:05:05,690
♫   Remember everything  ♫

959
01:05:05,690 --> 01:05:08,320
You did well.

960
01:05:11,150 --> 01:05:14,830
You did well, Oh Jin Sim.

961
01:05:14,830 --> 01:05:17,610
♫  So make it count  ♫

962
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,730
♫   Please remember today  ♫

963
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:23,900
♫   A light wind and blooming flowers  ♫

964
01:05:23,900 --> 01:05:28,760
♫   one minute one second make it count  ♫

965
01:05:28,760 --> 01:05:31,980
♫   Then make me everlasting.  ♫

966
01:05:31,980 --> 01:05:35,530
♫   I will gather every moment  ♫

967
01:05:35,530 --> 01:05:39,030
♫   and I will give them to you  ♫

968
01:05:39,030 --> 01:05:41,360
♫  (la la la la)  ♫

969
01:05:41,360 --> 01:05:44,200
♫   Time passes again  ♫

970
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:46,740
♫  (la la la la)  ♫

971
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:49,160
♫  I shall hope. Make it count  ♫

972
01:05:49,160 --> 01:05:51,920
♫   Lazing on a bench in the afternoon  ♫

973
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,470
♫   Lie down comfortably, pillowed on my lap  ♫

974
01:05:54,470 --> 01:05:56,840
♫   Because the time which is slack is sweet  ♫ 
  Touch Your Heart 

975
01:05:56,840 --> 01:05:58,760
♫  Because the gravity here is exactly twice as much  ♫ 
  Touch Your Heart 

976
01:05:58,790 --> 01:06:01,930
 Help me with studying. Tomorrow. As a reward.  

977
01:06:01,970 --> 01:06:04,460
 This feels like a campus date for some reason. 

978
01:06:04,460 --> 01:06:07,320
 Because my secretary said that she wanted to study about the law, 

979
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:08,520
 we went to study. 

980
01:06:08,520 --> 01:06:11,410
 I've lived long enough to see Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok dating. 

981
01:06:11,450 --> 01:06:15,680
 I'm not interested in Lawyer Kwon or anything. 

982
01:06:15,680 --> 01:06:17,600
 - Kwon Jeong Rok! 
- Yeo Reum! 

983
01:06:17,600 --> 01:06:21,130
 He disarmed in front of that prosecutor, Yoo Yeo Reum or whatever her name is.  

984
01:06:21,130 --> 01:06:23,160
 Why are you so easy with your smiles? 

985
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,700
 That's my first time ever hearing that. 

986
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:27,210
 I think that what you're doing right now is jealousy. 

987
01:06:27,210 --> 01:06:29,270
 Jealousy, he said? I can't believe this. 

988
01:06:29,270 --> 01:06:31,980
 - So, what? What about it? Why? 
- I'm saying that you're jealous. 

989
01:06:31,980 --> 01:06:35,180
 I have something to tell you, Lawyer Kwon. 

990
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:38,800
