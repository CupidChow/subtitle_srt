1
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:10,890
 Missing 
 She's gone. Oh Yeon Soo 

2
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:17,910
 CALL 

3
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:41,200
 Touch Your Heart 

4
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:53,260
Thanks to your emotional behavior, Yoo Na's heart was moved.

5
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:56,240
What about it?

6
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,290
You did well, Oh Jin Sim.

7
00:01:07,570 --> 00:01:10,670
Say that again.

8
00:01:13,820 --> 00:01:15,230
What?

9
00:01:16,010 --> 00:01:19,580
I'm asking you to compliment me again.

10
00:01:19,580 --> 00:01:23,950
What you just said made me really happy.

11
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:28,450
Say it one more time, please.

12
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:47,290
You did well.

13
00:01:50,630 --> 00:01:53,680
You did well, Oh Jin Sim.

14
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:10,080
Then, let's go now.

15
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:21,760
- We're back.
 - Oh, you're here?
  Episode 4 

16
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:25,920
Yoon Seo.

17
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,480
How did the trial go today? I heard that he argued that she was not guilty.

18
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,430
- Is that true?
 - Yes, well.

19
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,140
Awesome! I find a lawyer who flips the verdict over like that to be the sexiest.

20
00:02:39,140 --> 00:02:45,350
Now that I look at it, Lawyer Kwon is great at his job and is seriously handsome.

21
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:48,520
Don't you think he's cool? Just a little?

22
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,070
I don't know. I'm not too sure about that. Then...

23
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,260
What's cool about him?

24
00:03:24,850 --> 00:03:27,370
I need to control myself.

25
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:31,450
What are you staring at so intently?

26
00:03:31,450 --> 00:03:35,780
Oh, I told you. I bought some books so I can study law again.

27
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:37,230
Yes.

28
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,090
It's time to go home, though.

29
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:43,100
Oh, has it already gotten that late?

30
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:47,290
Then have a good weekend. I'll see you on Monday.

31
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:50,290
The weekend... One moment!

32
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:57,660
Earlier, you complimented me and said that I did well, right?

33
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,060
Yes.

34
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:02,070
Is that everything?

35
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:03,220
What?

36
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:07,830
I'm asking if it's all over if you just say that. Give me a reward!

37
00:04:09,740 --> 00:04:12,260
What do you mean, a reward?

38
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:14,260
Teach me how to study.

39
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:17,880
I bought books because I was overly motivated, but it's really hard because I'm doing it alone.

40
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,220
I don't really understand it, either.

41
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:25,640
So, teach me how to study it tomorrow as my reward.

42
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,260
- Alright.
 - Oh?

43
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,660
Because the reward for your good work is logical. Then, I'll see you tomorrow.

44
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:46,130
What am I doing right now?

45
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,840
 Heights Mansion 

46
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:56,460
When I was here last time, the lights in your dressing room were about to go out.

47
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,080
I will replace them for you quickly and leave.

48
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,260
Why did I do that?

49
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,770
What? Who did?

50
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,860
No, it's nothing.

51
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:17,890
 I'm planning to visit my professor tomorrow at school. How about you study in an empty lecture hall? 

52
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:21,830
 I think that you'll be more comfortable in a lecture hall instead of a crowded library. 

53
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,700
He's considerate in a subtle way.

54
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,680
No, don't mention it. I'm just replacing the lights, that's all. Why go so far as to call it "considerate"?

55
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,100
Goodness, my Yoon Seo. You are so touched that I'm considerately replacing the lights for you, right?

56
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,260
Ah, that's right. That's right, I'm so touched.

57
00:05:37,260 --> 00:05:42,600
What should you do? You're in big trouble today. There's something else I was considerate about.

58
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,060
I set you up a treatment appointment with Dr. Kwon tomorrow!

59
00:05:46,770 --> 00:05:48,450
Tomorrow?

60
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,000
You can't sleep well these days, right? Let's go and consult with the doctor and get you some medicine to take regularly.

61
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,370
Ah, that...

62
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:59,790
What should I do? I can't do it tomorrow. I agreed to go study tomorrow.

63
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:03,420
What did you agree to do?

64
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:07,570
To study. I mean, if I'm going to work at a law firm,

65
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:11,150
I should know some basic legal terms.

66
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:14,660
So I agreed to go study with Mr. Lawyer tomorrow.

67
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,230
With that lawyer?

68
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:21,140
You have to meet separately on the weekend?

69
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:23,650
Yoon Seo, do you perhaps...?

70
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:27,170
- What?
 - Again?
 - Hm?

71
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,960
You are on terrible terms with that lawyer, right?

72
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,620
So you're calling him out on the weekend to drive him crazy!

73
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,050
You do your revenge real properly.

74
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:40,510
Good job, Yoon Seo. It's really tiring to be with you all day, you know.

75
00:06:40,510 --> 00:06:44,370
If he's with you Monday through Friday and then even the weekend,

76
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:49,190
what will happen to that lawyer? What will he do?

77
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:53,360
I should go replace the lights now.

78
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:02,470
 Alright. I'd love that. 

79
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:20,730
Tada!

80
00:07:20,730 --> 00:07:25,510
Wait a minute. It's too bright and pretty.

81
00:07:25,510 --> 00:07:28,590
He might take it wrong and think that I tried hard to get his attention.

82
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,300
This one is... elegant and pretty.

83
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:34,430
This one is innocent and pretty.

84
00:07:34,430 --> 00:07:39,260
This one is... I am angelic.  It looks like a pure angel.

85
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:44,130
Oh, goodness. I look so pretty in any of them!

86
00:07:45,290 --> 00:07:47,060
I'm late!

87
00:07:47,060 --> 00:07:52,360
I should put on the first outfit. Oh, you angel.

88
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:22,290
You are early.

89
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:25,660
There was less traffic than I expected.

90
00:08:25,660 --> 00:08:30,050
Anyway, thank you for allotting time for me today.

91
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:34,640
No problem. The lecture hall is that way. Let's go.

92
00:08:38,930 --> 00:08:42,530
 What's with this? It feels different seeing him in this kind of clothes. 

93
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:47,110
 By the way, this kind of feels like a campus date for some reason. 

94
00:08:47,110 --> 00:08:50,800
 Does he perhaps have this in his mind? 

95
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,020
 So, in this case, the Special Act is applied before the General Act. 

96
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:17,860
My goodness, men just can't be helped.

97
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:22,660
You may decline to loan  money which is going to be  borrowed for  gambling.

98
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,600
The reason is in Article 103 of the Civil Code.

99
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:30,090
Because any act which is contrary to good morals and the social order is deemed invalid.

100
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:35,130
Therefore there is no legal problem if you refuse to loan me money which money is borrowed to gamble.

101
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:39,660
Then you'll be curious if you can get your money  back if you lent it out.

102
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:44,060
In the Civil Act, Article 746.

103
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,870
"If a person grants property..." It's in the book.

104
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:52,660
"If a person is grants property for an illegal cause,  he may not demand the return of the property."

105
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:56,330
That means that you can't get it back. Do you understand?

106
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:58,800
- Well, roughly?
 - Ah, yes.

107
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:04,200
By the way, Mr. Lawyer, you can take a seat and teach me, you know.

108
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,950
No, it's good that I have a board over here.

109
00:10:05,950 --> 00:10:09,840
Then, we will move on to the next chapter. The Civil Act, Article  747.

110
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,450
Wait a second.

111
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:17,910
Can we go somewhere else to study?

112
00:10:17,910 --> 00:10:20,730
There is no board in other places.

113
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:26,580
 Raon Drive In Theater 

114
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,460
You said you wanted to go somewhere else to study, but why here..?

115
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:37,470
Oh, well... In order to study, you don't need to write on a board,

116
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:41,370
read books, and memorize them. You can still learn in other ways.

117
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:47,360
A new legal movie happens to be out, so why don't we watch that to study?

118
00:10:50,770 --> 00:10:53,970
Have you ever been to a drive-in theater?

119
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:58,550
I'm not comfortable going to regular theaters so I usually come here.

120
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:01,500
It's my first time coming to a drive-in theater.

121
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:04,440
Actually, it's been a while since I went to the movies.

122
00:11:05,170 --> 00:11:06,840
How long has it been?

123
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:10,290
It was Avatar in 2009 so...

124
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:12,430
What? Avatar?

125
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:17,280
Yes. The movie of the blue-skinned tribe on the planet Pandora.

126
00:11:17,280 --> 00:11:20,950
Then... Does that mean that you're watching a movie for the first time in ten years?

127
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:24,300
I was busy studying and I don't like movies that much either.

128
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:28,320
Even Avatar... Yeo Reum wanted to watch it so I couldn't help but go with her.

129
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,160
Yeo Reum...?

130
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,290
She's my friend from college.

131
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,600
It's 22,000 won.

132
00:11:44,660 --> 00:11:47,660
 What's Wrong with the Lawyer?
 Mr. Lawyer, this is the account transfer history of Professor Jang's wife.  

133
00:11:47,660 --> 00:11:51,490
 You were right. There is a history that she deposited 20 million won in cash at the end of last year. 

134
00:11:51,490 --> 00:11:54,700
 - If we don't prove the source of this money... 
- She's so cool.

135
00:11:54,700 --> 00:11:56,500
 I believe we won't be able to use it as evidence... 

136
00:11:56,500 --> 00:12:00,540
I guess that the lawyer who is trying to implement justice is a cool character.

137
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:04,410
No, not that. I'm talking about her outfits.

138
00:12:04,410 --> 00:12:07,950
Her outfits are too fancy for a legal secretary.

139
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:10,680
I have a lot of pretty clothes, too.

140
00:12:11,840 --> 00:12:16,820
Mr. Lawyer, can you give me permission to wear colorful clothes?

141
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,840
Did I ever prohibit you from wearing colorful clothes?

142
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:21,890
You criticized me earlier.

143
00:12:21,890 --> 00:12:25,010
Saying that my outfits were not appropriate or whatnot.

144
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:29,240
I said that because they were not comfortable to work in. Color doesn't matter.

145
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,210
Really? Then can I wear pink clothes?

146
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:36,300
- Yes, you can.
 - Yes!

147
00:12:37,510 --> 00:12:42,460
By the way, you wanted to learn by watching the movie. You could've just watched it on your own, no?

148
00:12:42,460 --> 00:12:45,310
Why do you have to watch it with me?

149
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,190
Well, that is...

150
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:54,670
Ah ... It's because I can ask you questions

151
00:12:54,670 --> 00:12:57,610
on the spot anytime while watching the movie.

152
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:02,500
For example, ... that just now.

153
00:13:02,500 --> 00:13:07,050
If your boss is too overbearing with what you wear,

154
00:13:07,050 --> 00:13:09,050
does that violate the law?

155
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:11,720
According to the employment rules based on the Labor Standards Act,

156
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:15,180
workplace attire can be regulated depending on the work environment.

157
00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,070
But you need a solid rational basis.

158
00:13:17,070 --> 00:13:22,490
because it violates the right to pursue happiness and the right of general liberty guaranteed by the Constitution.

159
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,690
I see.

160
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:29,950
See? If I were watching it alone, I wouldn't have been able to ask you.

161
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:34,350
I guess. Then ask me more questions if there's anything else that you're curious about.

162
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,360
More?

163
00:13:53,200 --> 00:13:55,510
I didn't mean to hold your hand! Don't get me wrong.

164
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:58,920
I'm not the type of woman who tries to take advantage of dark theaters to hold hands.

165
00:13:58,920 --> 00:14:03,160
Sure, I'm not misunderstanding. Don't worry.

166
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:10,630
I was curious about this too. You see if I want to put my arm here,

167
00:14:10,630 --> 00:14:15,460
but you wanted to put your arm here too, and you did put yours here first, right?

168
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:21,140
Then... If that happens in the theater, who gets to use it?

169
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:24,050
Not everything is answered by law.

170
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,010
There are things like good faith and social rules.

171
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:31,580
It means everyone needs to compromise a little bit and resolve problems by common sense.

172
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:33,360
I see.

173
00:14:37,530 --> 00:14:42,360
By the way, you seem to know everything about the law.

174
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:44,570
Well, I'm a lawyer after all.

175
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:48,240
Right, you are a lawyer.

176
00:15:19,210 --> 00:15:20,740
Sorry?

177
00:15:23,550 --> 00:15:25,230
What is this?

178
00:15:32,370 --> 00:15:37,590
I saw some woman was talking to you earlier.

179
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:41,560
What did she say? Did she ask you for directions or something?

180
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:44,960
Not for directions. She wanted my number.

181
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:48,620
So, did you give her your number?

182
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:50,710
No, I didn't.

183
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:55,320
But still, it seemed like you two were talking for some time.

184
00:15:55,320 --> 00:15:57,820
When I told her I couldn't give her my number, she asked me whether I have a girlfriend or not.

185
00:15:57,820 --> 00:16:01,100
When I told her I don't have a girlfriend, she asked me why wouldn't I give her my number then.

186
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:04,060
So I tried to help her understand that there is no correlation

187
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:06,570
between my status and my willingness to share my number.

188
00:16:06,570 --> 00:16:08,640
I gave her quite a long explanation.

189
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,670
Why are you laughing?

190
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:17,860
I mean, it seems like you have a frozen solid  cold shoulder for women.

191
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:31,930
Why are you looking at me like that?

192
00:16:31,930 --> 00:16:35,310
Because it's my first time seeing you smile that big.

193
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:42,550
Why are you looking so serious again? Smile big again, like you did earlier.

194
00:16:42,550 --> 00:16:45,130
It was really nice seeing you smile.

195
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:50,010
I will smile when I want to.

196
00:17:10,580 --> 00:17:12,400
Thank you for giving me a ride.

197
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:15,880
No problem. I will see you on Monday.

198
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,300
 Raon Drive-in Theater 
 Oh!

199
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:37,230
You went to the movies. With whom?

200
00:17:38,260 --> 00:17:39,910
None of your business.

201
00:17:39,910 --> 00:17:43,340
Why? I'm really curious though.

202
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:47,720
I didn't expect to see Kwon Jeong Rok going on a date.

203
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,030
It wasn't a date.

204
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:53,780
Sure, sure. You never go to the movies, but you did. That says it all.

205
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:57,100
I'm telling you it wasn't a date. We went to study.

206
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,630
What? Study?

207
00:17:59,630 --> 00:18:02,680
My secretary wanted to learn about the law.

208
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:06,680
So we went together to watch a law movie to study.

209
00:18:06,680 --> 00:18:09,260
Do you think that makes sense?

210
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:12,860
Do you think it makes sense for you to keep living in my house then?

211
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:15,500
Don't you think it's time for you to move out now?

212
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:19,520
Okay, okay. I will stop here for today. Relax.

213
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:24,760
Mr. Kwon Jeong Rok, who went to the movie theater to study law.

214
00:18:40,550 --> 00:18:45,260
 Mr. Lawyer, thank you so much for teaching me law today.  

215
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:47,580
 Good night. 

216
00:18:58,500 --> 00:19:01,800
 You also have a good dream, Ms. Oh Jin Sim. 

217
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,440
 You are not getting out? I'm going to break this. 

218
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:11,570
 You can talk to me from now on. 

219
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:13,790
 I'm her lawyer. 

220
00:19:13,790 --> 00:19:17,140
So, what was that? Why did he help me there then?

221
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:21,360
Why, why, why, why? Because he was worried about me?

222
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:26,960
 You did well. Good job. 

223
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:28,970
 Ms. Oh Jin Sim. 

224
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:31,980
Well, he could've just handed me the scarf.

225
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:34,680
Why did he put the scarf around my neck?

226
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,390
Why, why, why, why?

227
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,380
Why did he smile big like that?

228
00:19:43,380 --> 00:19:45,980
Did I make him smile like that?

229
00:19:45,980 --> 00:19:49,070
Oh, my goodness.

230
00:19:49,070 --> 00:19:52,350
Why? Why did he smile?

231
00:20:06,860 --> 00:20:09,230
Good morning, Mr. Lawyer.

232
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:21,870
You look so good in your suit today—

233
00:20:21,870 --> 00:20:24,980
Hi there, Yoon Seo. Good morning.

234
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:27,190
Hello.

235
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,350
By the way, Yoon Seo. The elevators usually get really crowded in the morning. Is it okay?

236
00:20:34,350 --> 00:20:38,170
I'm constantly worried that people might recognize you.

237
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:39,710
Can you recognize me?

238
00:20:39,710 --> 00:20:42,120
Of course, of cour—

239
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,100
Is it just me that recognizes you?

240
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:47,600
Well, I guess.. I would recognize you even if you had a niqāb (face veil) on. Why is that?

241
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:51,100
Because I'm your forever...

242
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,500
Just your boss.

243
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,800
I knew you are the best, Mr. CEO.

244
00:20:57,940 --> 00:21:00,590
By the way, do you wait for me by the elevator every morning?

245
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:02,290
It seems like we always see each other at the elevator.

246
00:21:02,290 --> 00:21:04,010
You think so, right?

247
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:06,300
We always bump into each other in the elevator, don't we?

248
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:10,490
I find it fascinating too. You call this destiny.

249
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:15,240
You and me. And even together with our Ms. Yoon Seo.

250
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:18,470
A destiny. Don't you agree, Yoon Seo?

251
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,250
- Well, I guess so.
 - Really?

252
00:21:21,250 --> 00:21:23,610
Excuse me.

253
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,680
Yes, PD Lee Joong Jae.

254
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:28,100
It's a PD  (program director) .

255
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,620
Oh.

256
00:21:30,430 --> 00:21:32,080
One more person?

257
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:34,530
You said this is an urgent meeting? What's going on so suddenly?

258
00:21:34,530 --> 00:21:38,600
It's nothing big. I just got a call from a broadcast station.

259
00:21:38,600 --> 00:21:40,470
He asked me.

260
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:41,950
A personal call.

261
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,320
What kind of show...?

262
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:46,430
Well, it's a discussion about the 4th Industrial Revolution.

263
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:50,850
I guess they want to hear a lawyer's thoughts on it.

264
00:21:50,850 --> 00:21:53,520
I've told him I would do it but I feel kind of overwhelmed.

265
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,910
You all know

266
00:21:54,910 --> 00:21:59,530
I have no interest in getting attention or making my name big. I'm just a type of person

267
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:02,400
that does his best, diligently, with the work that he is assigned.

268
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:04,280
Right?

269
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,350
But that PD is begging me to do it.

270
00:22:07,350 --> 00:22:10,940
"Let's just sacrifice myself to make our 'Always' name."

271
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:13,840
I've decided to do it with this kind of thought.

272
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:17,230
Oh, it's already on your SNS.

273
00:22:17,230 --> 00:22:19,390
Oh, hi.

274
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:23,840
Hello, this is CEO Yeon Joong Gyoo, from Always. I am going to be on a debate show.

275
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,820
It's going to be broadcast on Feb 15, 9 AM. Please catch the original airing.

276
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:39,450
Anyway, it's going to be broadcast live tomorrow morning.

277
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:43,300
I just got a call from the PD. He wishes to have one more lawyer.

278
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:45,350
Just one more.

279
00:22:45,350 --> 00:22:46,650
Who would be the best fit?

280
00:22:46,650 --> 00:22:48,060
I think...

281
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:52,100
With great speech skills that allow him to speak confidently in front of cameras,

282
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:55,280
and with a good visual for broadcast,

283
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,010
Lawyer Kwon should do it. What do you think?

284
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,300
You think so, too, right? Lawyer Kwon would be the best fit. Okay.

285
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:04,560
Then, Lawyer Kwon and I will do it tomorrow morning. Let's wrap up here—

286
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,600
No, I will reject the offer. I have a lot of tasks for tomorrow.

287
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,190
If this was the agenda for this urgent meeting, I will leave now.

288
00:23:10,190 --> 00:23:12,220
Please get ready. We need to go to court.

289
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:14,030
Yes, Sir.

290
00:23:14,030 --> 00:23:15,400
Oh, goodness..

291
00:23:15,400 --> 00:23:17,990
How can he be so cold-hearted?

292
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:21,060
He could've at least rejected my offer with a little smile. That would've been so nice.

293
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:24,090
Lawyer Kwon doesn't smile much. It's nothing new.

294
00:23:24,090 --> 00:23:28,460
Well, I'm not sure. Wouldn't he smile in front of someone he feels like smiling at?

295
00:23:28,460 --> 00:23:34,480
He would smile when he's really happy and feels good. For instance...

296
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:42,250
No, never mind. Then, I'll be leaving as well.

297
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,990
Anyway, if Lawyer Kwon doesn't want to do it, who should?

298
00:23:48,990 --> 00:23:51,610
What about Lawyer Choi or Lawyer Dan?

299
00:23:51,610 --> 00:23:53,410
- Me!
 - Me!

300
00:23:55,210 --> 00:23:56,340
You both want to do it?

301
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,180
Put your hand down.

302
00:23:59,420 --> 00:24:02,250
 Move out of the No Parking Zone! 

303
00:24:03,970 --> 00:24:07,460
Then... The next trial is in two weeks, correct?

304
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:10,180
Yes. You need to confirm the date and location of the trial.

305
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,350
Yes, Sir!

306
00:24:11,350 --> 00:24:13,470
Kwon Jeong Rok!

307
00:24:13,470 --> 00:24:15,060
Yeo Reum.

308
00:24:15,060 --> 00:24:18,580
Yeo Reum? Ah, right.

309
00:24:19,570 --> 00:24:20,600
You had a trial?

310
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:22,500
Yeah. Did you just get out too?

311
00:24:22,500 --> 00:24:27,520
Yeah. What perfect timing. Should we grab a coffee or something now if you have some time?

312
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,610
Should we...? I have about 30 minutes.

313
00:24:31,610 --> 00:24:34,890
Hello, there. You are Secretary Oh, right?

314
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:36,070
How do you know about me?

315
00:24:36,070 --> 00:24:39,160
I just happened to hear about you.

316
00:24:39,160 --> 00:24:41,920
Let's have some tea together. It's okay with you, right?

317
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,930
Secretary Oh can't go to a busy place.

318
00:24:44,930 --> 00:24:48,880
No, it's okay. I will come along.

319
00:24:52,220 --> 00:24:54,200
- Thank you. 
 - No problem.

320
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:56,580
Then, please have a good talk.

321
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:02,190
Americanos for me and Ms. Oh. An instant coffee for you, right?

322
00:25:03,010 --> 00:25:06,350
You and your childish palate haven't changed. You only drink your coffee sweet.

323
00:25:06,350 --> 00:25:09,810
I don't understand people who enjoy bitter taste.

324
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:11,450
A childish palate?

325
00:25:11,450 --> 00:25:16,310
You didn't know? He can't drink other coffee besides these sweet instant ones.

326
00:25:17,070 --> 00:25:18,420
I see.

327
00:25:18,420 --> 00:25:20,470
Not just coffee. Even food—

328
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:22,750
Stop there, won't you?

329
00:25:22,750 --> 00:25:24,710
Should I, then?

330
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,290
Ah, I'm sorry for bringing you here without asking you first.

331
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:32,100
A place where you won't get noticed and have conversations freely.

332
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,630
I could only think of this place.

333
00:25:33,630 --> 00:25:36,860
No, it's fine. Well.

334
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,130
Anywhere is fine with me.

335
00:25:39,130 --> 00:25:43,420
To be honest, I know your identity, Ms. Oh. You are Ms. Oh Yoon Seo, right?

336
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:44,900
Oh, my.

337
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,890
No way!

338
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:53,160
- It wasn't me.
 - I heard from Lawyer Choi Yoon Hyeok. I happened to see him at the court a while ago.

339
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:54,860
I see.

340
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,860
Anyway, how do you like working as a secretary?

341
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:59,660
Jeong Rok's personality is something. He might give you hard times.

342
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:01,040
- What about my personality?
 - Well—

343
00:26:01,040 --> 00:26:02,460
What about it?

344
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:05,360
You don't know how brusque you are.

345
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,560
You make me really dislike you sometimes, you know.

346
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:11,080
I am?

347
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,930
Yeah, you are.

348
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:18,510
You two... It seems like you two are really close.

349
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:22,010
We've stuck together since college.

350
00:26:22,010 --> 00:26:24,220
You two?

351
00:26:24,220 --> 00:26:26,050
Three of us.

352
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,830
Including Kim Se Won.

353
00:26:27,830 --> 00:26:29,960
Kim Se Won?

354
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:34,560
Let's meet up soon, all three of us. You can't not see him forever.

355
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:36,590
We are all busy, so...

356
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:40,670
Anyway, we should go eat together sometime.

357
00:26:40,670 --> 00:26:42,890
Sure. I'm good anytime.

358
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:45,070
I'm almost touched.

359
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:48,760
I didn't mean to leave you out of the conversation.

360
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:52,080
You should join us when we eat out next time.

361
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,620
Well... We will see.

362
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:01,690
Why don't you put your scarf on? Aren't you cold?

363
00:27:01,690 --> 00:27:04,280
No, it feels okay today.

364
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:06,430
I guess you don't really get cold easily.

365
00:27:06,430 --> 00:27:09,670
No. That's why I like winter.

366
00:27:09,670 --> 00:27:12,990
Not summer  (Korean word for summer sounds the same as Yeo Reum)? 

367
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:14,070
Sorry?

368
00:27:14,070 --> 00:27:15,900
Never mind.

369
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:20,150
And this morning I asked you to give me the document which has been checked for typos and errors by 5 o'clock.

370
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:22,870
I don't want to. I will do it by 5:10.

371
00:27:22,870 --> 00:27:25,050
I'm a bit tired.

372
00:27:28,190 --> 00:27:30,710
By the way, Mr. Lawyer.

373
00:27:30,710 --> 00:27:33,650
Why do you smile so easily?

374
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,500
That's my first time ever hearing that.

375
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:40,460
Didn't you say it was good to see me smiling a few days ago?

376
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:43,230
You should do it in moderation.

377
00:27:43,230 --> 00:27:47,330
The more I look at it... I don't think smiling suits you.

378
00:27:48,160 --> 00:27:50,900
Stop smiling!

379
00:27:55,550 --> 00:27:58,490
What... What's wrong with her?

380
00:28:00,250 --> 00:28:05,200
The pasta place you recommended was quite nice. I should bring my coworkers next time.

381
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:08,600
If you share the information with just anyone, its value will go down.

382
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:11,380
Is that so?

383
00:28:11,380 --> 00:28:13,710
Right! How's Prosecutor Kim Se Won?

384
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:17,560
- What do you mean?
 - Prosecutor Kim is the idol of our prosecutor's office, you know.

385
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:22,230
When he left here to go to the office in Chuncheon, so many female employees cried.

386
00:28:22,230 --> 00:28:27,330
Right. Do you think Prosecutor Kim has a girlfriend?

387
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:31,090
No, he doesn't. It ended two years ago.

388
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:32,480
How do you know that?

389
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:36,370
They were a hot couple, him and Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum.

390
00:28:36,370 --> 00:28:38,300
Senior Yoo Yeo Reum?

391
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:43,890
Yes. They were in a relationship for seven years and broke up two years ago.

392
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,970
Why did they break up?

393
00:28:45,970 --> 00:28:49,400
Well, I'm not sure...

394
00:28:49,400 --> 00:28:53,650
Well, is it because of Senior Yoo's personality as I heard?

395
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:01,490
Ms. Prosecutor.

396
00:29:01,490 --> 00:29:03,900
Why are you standing like that?

397
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:07,870
Do you think I will do something to you because I have a poor personality?

398
00:29:07,870 --> 00:29:10,640
I'm sorry, Sunbaenim.

399
00:29:10,640 --> 00:29:12,800
It's true though.

400
00:29:12,800 --> 00:29:14,910
Ah, right, Ms. Jeong Mi.

401
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:19,520
Let's go to that pasta place with me next time. You should share goods with others.

402
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,800
Ah, that scared me.

403
00:29:45,190 --> 00:29:47,380
Are you in a bad mood?

404
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,450
No, I'm not.

405
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:50,200
I heard something.

406
00:29:50,200 --> 00:29:54,080
I heard that you went to college with Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum.

407
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,200
Right.

408
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:58,990
I heard you two were close. Past tense.

409
00:30:00,900 --> 00:30:02,730
Right.

410
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:05,850
But we are planning to be on good terms again. Present tense.

411
00:30:05,850 --> 00:30:07,050
Why?

412
00:30:07,050 --> 00:30:11,340
You know you can't use a broken plate even if you glue the pieces together.

413
00:30:11,340 --> 00:30:15,920
It's my personal taste. When I see something broken with flaws,

414
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:18,210
I can't just stand still and watch.

415
00:30:18,210 --> 00:30:19,980
Then...

416
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:22,890
I should get broken too.

417
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,150
What?

418
00:30:24,150 --> 00:30:26,150
Nothing.

419
00:30:37,820 --> 00:30:40,020
Thank you.

420
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:51,010
Ah... By the way, what should I do?

421
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,970
About the broadcast I mean.

422
00:30:52,970 --> 00:30:55,720
Since you both want to do it, it's hard to decide.

423
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,430
What do you think, my Always members?

424
00:30:58,430 --> 00:31:01,150
I think Lawyer Dan would be a better fit.

425
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:05,630
Since you are a man, Mr. CEO, don't you think it would look nice to have a woman?

426
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:10,410
Well, I'm not sure. It's not Family Game Room or something. Why do we divide men and women?

427
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:13,010
I think Lawyer Choi would be a better fit.

428
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:15,250
Lawyer Choi is witty and

429
00:31:15,250 --> 00:31:19,000
I don't think he will get nervous, unlike Lawyer Dan.

430
00:31:19,000 --> 00:31:21,440
Ah... As for me,

431
00:31:22,180 --> 00:31:25,120
I totally agree with Secretary Yang.

432
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:28,170
I pay my respect to your great eyes, you two.

433
00:31:28,170 --> 00:31:32,410
Wait, let's see. So These two think Lawyer Choi is better,

434
00:31:32,410 --> 00:31:37,560
but I think Lawyer Dan would be better, much more calm.. which makes two votes for her.

435
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,390
Two to two. It's a tie.

436
00:31:39,390 --> 00:31:40,890
Wow.

437
00:31:40,890 --> 00:31:44,980
In my opinion, our Lawyer Dan would be more—

438
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:47,440
Please excuse me.

439
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:48,720
Ah, Prosecutor Park.

440
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:52,290
I was going to give you a call.

441
00:31:53,900 --> 00:31:56,160
Lawyer Dan, you should just give it up.

442
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:59,070
I'm sorry, but I also really want to do this.

443
00:31:59,070 --> 00:32:01,800
Lawyer Dan, you must be ambitious about the broadcast.

444
00:32:01,800 --> 00:32:04,380
Since you are introverted, I thought that you would dislike being on a broadcast.

445
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:08,490
Well, I... My performance hasn't been so good these days,

446
00:32:08,490 --> 00:32:12,290
So, I want to get a breakthrough through this opportunity.

447
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:14,250
- A breakthrough? 
 - Once something goes on air,

448
00:32:14,250 --> 00:32:16,110
whether it's a restaurant or a tourist attraction, they all blow up in fame.

449
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,140
I want to be a famous lawyer and become Always Law Firm's ace.

450
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:23,580
The CEO has been roasting me about my performance so much that it's suffocating me.

451
00:32:26,990 --> 00:32:31,450
In my opinion, it's better for Lawyer Dan to back out.

452
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:34,760
What if you suffocate to death while working with me?

453
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:38,960
I'm disappointed in you, Lawyer Dan. I didn't know you talked behind people's back like that.

454
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:42,390
I... CEO, it's not that.

455
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:47,260
The vote I gave to you, I'll void it. I can void it, right?

456
00:32:47,260 --> 00:32:51,860
Then, how many votes do you have, Lawyer Choi? Three votes. And Lawyer Dan? One vote.

457
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:53,610
Let's do well on the broadcast tomorrow.

458
00:32:53,610 --> 00:32:56,750
I respect your rational judgment.

459
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:05,310
Mom, Mom, Mom! Don't be surprised, I...

460
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,810
I'm going on a broadcast! In a debate program!

461
00:33:08,810 --> 00:33:11,660
I am so happy!

462
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:14,860
Mom, why aren't you saying anything? Are you crying?

463
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:19,130
Don't cry. You're making me cry, too.

464
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:29,740
Yes, Mother. I'll talk to you later at home.

465
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,830
You look excited.

466
00:33:32,830 --> 00:33:34,890
What do you mean by excited?

467
00:33:34,890 --> 00:33:38,610
A comrade's sadness is our sadness.

468
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:58,960
How do you organize PDFs?

469
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:06,000
Everything should be organized here.

470
00:34:11,630 --> 00:34:14,300
Five stars?
  Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum's office 

471
00:34:14,300 --> 00:34:16,800
It's not a stone bed or something...

472
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,210
This person must be a very important person.

473
00:34:25,610 --> 00:34:28,840
Aren't you going to get off work? It's past work hours.

474
00:34:28,840 --> 00:34:32,080
The time to get off work for you seems to be important.

475
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:34,030
There are so many important things.

476
00:34:34,030 --> 00:34:38,670
You have many important matters and many important people.

477
00:34:38,670 --> 00:34:42,510
- What do you mean? 
 - Then, I'll punch out.

478
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:58,740
I just told her to get off work because it was time do so.

479
00:34:58,740 --> 00:35:00,290
Isn't it extremely funny?

480
00:35:00,290 --> 00:35:04,260
What kind of manners is it to sit and talk about something that only they know about  front of someone else?

481
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:08,330
Mr. Lawyer is the same! He's always so cold at the law firm.

482
00:35:08,330 --> 00:35:13,290
In front of that Prosecutor Yoo Yeo Reum or whatever her name is... He was completely ingratiating.

483
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,940
- He keeps giggling which makes him even more despicable. 
 - Excuse me, Yoon Seo.

484
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:20,060
That's right. He's really despicable, isn't he? You think so too, don't you, Oppa?

485
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:21,810
No, it's not that.

486
00:35:21,810 --> 00:35:25,320
I'm just asking you this just in case.

487
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:28,120
Do you like that lawyer?

488
00:35:28,120 --> 00:35:30,940
No way. What are you saying?

489
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:35,620
To be honest, when you said that you were going to meet up with him over the weekend to study,

490
00:35:35,620 --> 00:35:40,430
I didn't think much of it back then. But, now that I think of it again, it's a little strange.

491
00:35:40,430 --> 00:35:45,300
So, I thought that it was not possible. But, since you're acting like this...

492
00:35:45,300 --> 00:35:47,910
Acting how?

493
00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:51,680
- You sound jealous. 
  - What?

494
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,610
Jealous?

495
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,030
He said that I like him? That I'm being jealous?

496
00:36:01,030 --> 00:36:04,420
Why in the world did he think of such impossible things?

497
00:36:05,010 --> 00:36:08,150
This won't do. Before I get misunderstood, I should be careful of my actions.

498
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,160
I'm speechless.

499
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,670
 Morning Debate 

500
00:36:18,670 --> 00:36:20,820
Is it airing now?

501
00:36:20,820 --> 00:36:23,850
- Well, whatever. 
 - Good morning.

502
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:25,800
Hello.

503
00:36:27,510 --> 00:36:30,050
But, why are you all gathered here?

504
00:36:30,050 --> 00:36:33,360
CEO and Lawyer Choi are going to have a live broadcast debate.

505
00:36:33,360 --> 00:36:37,120
We are going to watch it live together, so we are waiting for it to air.

506
00:36:37,120 --> 00:36:40,310
Is it not time for Lawyer Kwon to be at work yet?

507
00:36:40,310 --> 00:36:44,640
How come you are here earlier than him? Did something happen?

508
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,700
Well, I don't know why he isn't here yet.

509
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:52,920
It's not like I am concerned about Lawyer Kwon.

510
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:56,610
You should be concerned. You're his secretary.

511
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:01,470
Ah, that's right.

512
00:37:01,470 --> 00:37:05,710
He said he would be late because he's going to meet a client.

513
00:37:05,710 --> 00:37:07,470
It's starting!

514
00:37:09,580 --> 00:37:11,910
 Hello to our viewers. 

515
00:37:11,910 --> 00:37:14,440
 I am Morning Debate's host, Han Seok Gyu. 

516
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:17,800
But, I don't see Lawyer Choi.

517
00:37:17,800 --> 00:37:20,030
That's right. Where did he go?

518
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,470
I am here.

519
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:26,010
-  Hello.  
 - What happened?

520
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:29,350
- Aren't you going on the broadcast? 
 - I got a call this morning.

521
00:37:29,350 --> 00:37:32,810
They said that there should be only four lawyers on the panel, so the two of us was too much.

522
00:37:32,810 --> 00:37:36,730
So, as initially planned, only the CEO will be appearing.

523
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,610
Then, have fun watching it.

524
00:37:47,610 --> 00:37:50,360
Of course, It won't be fun without me, though.

525
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:55,840
There aren't many opportunities to go on a  broadcast. That's too bad.

526
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:59,010
Anyway, CEO will do well to make up for Lawyer Choi.

527
00:37:59,010 --> 00:38:02,470
 We will listen to Always Law Firm CEO Yeon Joon Gyoo's opinion. 

528
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:04,420
CEO Yeon Joon Gyoo.

529
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:07,800
In the legal field, the only thing you can't do is to stand idly by.

530
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:12,060
In the US' law business, AI (artificial intelligence) lawyers are already well established.

531
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:14,150
Last year, in Korea,

532
00:38:14,150 --> 00:38:17,400
the first AI lawyer was introduced.

533
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:18,810
What do you think about it?

534
00:38:18,810 --> 00:38:22,860
It seems like it would greatly change the field of law.

535
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,460
That's right.

536
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,780
- Oh, I see.  
 - Yes.

537
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:30,620
That's right.

538
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:34,300
Klaus Schwab,  who coined the term, described the 4th industrial revolution as

539
00:38:34,300 --> 00:38:36,680
based on the 3rd industrial revolution,

540
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:39,860
it is a combination of the bio and digital industries, a fusion of the world's spheres of physics, etc,

541
00:38:39,860 --> 00:38:43,980
which created technology capable of rapidly changing the economy and social structure.

542
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:47,270
That's how Klaus Straub defined the 4th Industrial Revolution. Is that right, CEO?

543
00:38:47,270 --> 00:38:49,570
Please tell us your opinion.

544
00:38:49,570 --> 00:38:52,280
Of course. That's right.

545
00:38:54,530 --> 00:38:56,710
You are right.

546
00:38:56,710 --> 00:39:00,290
- Should we listen to someone's else opinion on the subject first? 
 - Yes, that's right.

547
00:39:00,290 --> 00:39:02,820
- This time, shall we listen to Kim Young Taek's—
 - "Of course."

548
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,510
"That's right." "Of course."

549
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,190
He can only say those three lines?

550
00:39:06,190 --> 00:39:09,610
He is putting shame on Always, seriously.

551
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:17,340
This is all your fault, Mom. I definitely told you that I wouldn't eat the seaweed soup, didn't I?

552
00:39:17,340 --> 00:39:20,830
My opportunity to go on a TV show slipped  away  (slimy seaweed)  because of you!

553
00:39:20,830 --> 00:39:22,920
You don't understand, Mom.

554
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,660
Yes, Mother. I will call you back later.

555
00:39:28,210 --> 00:39:29,870
What is it?

556
00:39:29,870 --> 00:39:33,870
I'm here to return this. Thank you.

557
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:39,960
You must be having a good time since I couldn't go on the TV show.

558
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:43,230
What are you saying? My coworker's sorrow is

559
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,420
my sorrow. Well, then.

560
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:48,490
Cheer up.

561
00:40:02,690 --> 00:40:05,100
Hello.

562
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:08,380
Well... Is Lawyer Kwon Jeong Rok here?

563
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,360
Did you make an appointment?

564
00:40:10,360 --> 00:40:12,490
What's your name?

565
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:15,570
No, I just wanted to have a consultation.

566
00:40:16,200 --> 00:40:19,420
I thought he could help me.

567
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:21,150
Here...

568
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:25,390
This article brought me here.

569
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,320
 Infringement on the right to a quiet, personal life. 

570
00:40:27,320 --> 00:40:31,590
Lawyer Kwon wrote this but

571
00:40:31,590 --> 00:40:34,710
you need an appointment— 
 - I'm Kwon Jeong Rok.

572
00:40:37,830 --> 00:40:39,900
What brings you here?

573
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:48,850
Well...

574
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:53,840
The reason I am here is that...

575
00:41:04,290 --> 00:41:06,130
Thank you.

576
00:41:07,780 --> 00:41:10,710
Excuse me.

577
00:41:10,710 --> 00:41:14,660
Can I have Ms. Secretary stay here while we have a conversation?

578
00:41:15,910 --> 00:41:18,410
- Me?
 - Yes.

579
00:41:18,410 --> 00:41:22,020
I'm quite anxious so...

580
00:41:22,020 --> 00:41:25,960
I think I'd feel better if a woman stays with me.

581
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:30,310
- Sure, take a seat.
 - Then...

582
00:41:30,950 --> 00:41:34,230
I'm not sure I'd be much help ...

583
00:41:36,100 --> 00:41:38,120
Thank you.

584
00:41:42,280 --> 00:41:45,290
You can talk comfortably now.

585
00:41:45,290 --> 00:41:48,260
I think I am being stalked by

586
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:52,060
my ex-boyfriend.

587
00:41:56,030 --> 00:41:59,770
It's really painful but I don't know what to do.

588
00:41:59,770 --> 00:42:03,730
Then I came across your writing and

589
00:42:03,730 --> 00:42:07,580
thought you might have a solution. That's why I came.

590
00:42:16,410 --> 00:42:19,950
Could you explain your situation in a bit more detail?

591
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,480
I dated him for about a year.

592
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:32,650
 What should I get? Oh, this one is cute. 

593
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:35,640
 What with this present out of the blue? 

594
00:42:35,640 --> 00:42:38,150
 The first few months were wonderful. 

595
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:42,010
 A humidifier. I really needed one. This is great! 

596
00:42:42,010 --> 00:42:44,170
 - Really?
 - He was sweet. 

597
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:48,770
 - Good to hear.
 - He took care of every little detail.
It looks so good. I want some pasta. 

598
00:42:48,770 --> 00:42:51,680
 Amazing. How could you make a reservation here? 

599
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:54,270
 I've really been craving pasta since yesterday. 

600
00:42:54,270 --> 00:42:58,170
 Really? I knew our telepathy would be no joke, right? 

601
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,770
 I know, right? 

602
00:42:59,770 --> 00:43:02,190
 Go ahead and enjoy. 

603
00:43:02,190 --> 00:43:05,080
 At first, I thought I'd found  

604
00:43:05,080 --> 00:43:07,600
 a true soulmate with so many things in common. 

605
00:43:07,600 --> 00:43:10,330
 But it was actually... 

606
00:43:13,370 --> 00:43:15,740
 Shall we have a glass of wine today, too? 

607
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,270
 So you can pass out after having one glass again? 

608
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:22,780
 You are perfect in everything but your alcohol tolerance is too low. 

609
00:43:22,780 --> 00:43:25,130
 Don't you think yours is too high? 

610
00:43:25,910 --> 00:43:27,680
 - Cheers.
 - Cheers. 

611
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:43,400
 While I was drunk and passed out, 

612
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:46,960
 he dug through my phone without my permission. 

613
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:51,600
 My search history, those websites that I frequently visit, 

614
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:54,820
 the chat history with my friends, and everything. 

615
00:43:56,700 --> 00:44:00,700
 So I told him we were breaking up and I made the arrangements to do so. 

616
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,400
 You're here? 

617
00:44:07,960 --> 00:44:10,210
 I've been preparing dinner for you. 

618
00:44:10,210 --> 00:44:13,150
 Oppa, we broke up though. 

619
00:44:18,250 --> 00:44:20,010
 You're saying that again? 

620
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:27,390
 Hurry up and come in, I will make some good food. 

621
00:44:33,850 --> 00:44:37,220
You should've reset your door lock passcode then.

622
00:44:37,220 --> 00:44:38,890
I did.

623
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:42,830
But still, he still figured it out.

624
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:48,600
So, I'd like to request a restraining order.

625
00:44:48,600 --> 00:44:49,600
Do you think that's possible?

626
00:44:49,600 --> 00:44:53,130
Of course it is! Right, Mr. Lawyer?

627
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:55,620
Well, I'm not sure.

628
00:44:55,620 --> 00:45:00,390
It is possible to get denied with only that much evidence.

629
00:45:00,390 --> 00:45:05,170
On his side, on the basis of  the absence  of violent behavior, verbal abuse and  tangible  force,

630
00:45:05,170 --> 00:45:10,100
how could one consider him as ex-boyfriend you broke up with who is reluctant to break up?

631
00:45:10,100 --> 00:45:11,450
No way!

632
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,860
You don't have to hit someone for it to be violence!

633
00:45:13,860 --> 00:45:17,770
He monitored her 24/7 and trespassed at her home all the time.

634
00:45:17,770 --> 00:45:20,890
Does it make sense that there's no way to stop that through the law?

635
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:25,250
Still, the fact is that we need more circumstantial evidence.

636
00:45:27,310 --> 00:45:31,000
By the way, Ms. Seung Hee, you said you have a high alcohol tolerance.

637
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,000
How come you got drunk first whenever you had drinks with him?

638
00:45:39,020 --> 00:45:44,070
He put drugs in my drink behind my back.

639
00:45:45,420 --> 00:45:46,750
Excuse me?

640
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,810
Drugs?

641
00:45:49,810 --> 00:45:54,100
I found it strange too that I'd always pass out whenever I drink with him.

642
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:58,560
I got tested the day after.

643
00:45:58,560 --> 00:46:02,910
I was told that my body had traces of sleeping pills.

644
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:09,070
 He would always 

645
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:12,580
 put a drug in my drink. 

646
00:46:36,740 --> 00:46:38,570
Ms. Oh Jin Sim?

647
00:46:42,220 --> 00:46:44,020
Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

648
00:46:47,110 --> 00:46:48,590
Yes?

649
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:39,430
What's wrong, Secretary Yang?

650
00:47:39,430 --> 00:47:43,020
What's wrong with  you , Mr. Office Manager? Why were you trying to strangle my neck?

651
00:47:43,020 --> 00:47:46,350
No, I just wanted to come with you.

652
00:47:47,550 --> 00:47:49,880
You scared me!

653
00:47:51,430 --> 00:47:53,170
I'm sorry.

654
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:06,060
Secretary Yang, you should take the main roads.

655
00:48:06,060 --> 00:48:07,660
Don't take places like bridge tunnels.

656
00:48:07,660 --> 00:48:10,930
Ah, that's a shortcut.

657
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,250
It's grass!

658
00:48:15,850 --> 00:48:17,520
My gosh, you're right.

659
00:48:17,520 --> 00:48:21,660
It must be freezing since it's winter. It's holding out so strongly.

660
00:48:22,100 --> 00:48:23,990
Just like how we are waiting for the bus,

661
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:27,220
that might be waiting for its own bus named spring. Don't you think so?

662
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:29,460
Oh, my. The bus is here.

663
00:48:29,460 --> 00:48:31,850
You are taking that one too, right?

664
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:33,300
Of course.

665
00:49:28,690 --> 00:49:31,120
 This stop is... 

666
00:49:31,120 --> 00:49:32,830
Secretary Yang.

667
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:35,200
Secretary Yang.

668
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,040
- We are here.
 - Oh, gosh.

669
00:49:37,670 --> 00:49:42,720
I'm thankful to you every time. I would've missed my stop if it weren't for you.

670
00:49:44,850 --> 00:49:45,820
Take care.

671
00:49:45,820 --> 00:49:48,170
I will see you tomorrow.

672
00:50:11,580 --> 00:50:15,690
It's been revealed that Natural Foods Restaurant CEO Jeong Ji Ho  will  appear

673
00:50:15,690 --> 00:50:19,070
 at the prosecutor's office tomorrow morning on the charge of gambling abroad. 

674
00:50:19,070 --> 00:50:22,350
 Recently, the natural food restaurant of franchise owners, which is on the verge of being publicly listed ... 

675
00:50:22,350 --> 00:50:24,260
You're home early.

676
00:50:24,260 --> 00:50:26,080
Oh, you're here?

677
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,490
What's this?

678
00:50:27,490 --> 00:50:29,300
 He said it has nothing to do with his business... 

679
00:50:29,300 --> 00:50:31,160
Song Ji Ho?

680
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:34,160
 However the growth of the natural food restaurant stock ... 

681
00:50:35,420 --> 00:50:38,500
Do you know how much Choi Yoon Soo is getting for defending Jeong Ji Ho?

682
00:50:39,250 --> 00:50:43,130
With a contingent bonus, if he is successful, 5 billion won.

683
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:46,830
He is smart to be charging a legal fee at that rate.

684
00:50:46,830 --> 00:50:50,450
He is a lawyer known for getting people off in the aftermath of political squabbling.

685
00:50:50,450 --> 00:50:53,370
I heard he made a big sum of money for the Lee Gang Joon case.

686
00:50:53,370 --> 00:50:55,050
Lee Gang Joon?

687
00:50:55,050 --> 00:50:58,780
You don't know him? The vice president of Jae Woo Group.

688
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:02,910
Well, you know he had a drug scandal with an actress a few years ago.

689
00:51:03,580 --> 00:51:05,620
Was it Oh Yoon Seo?

690
00:51:08,220 --> 00:51:09,070
Oh Yoon Seo?

691
00:51:09,070 --> 00:51:12,540
Yeah. But regarding that scandal, my junior told me that

692
00:51:12,540 --> 00:51:17,010
Lee Kang Joon stalked Oh Yoon Seo. When she rejected him,

693
00:51:17,010 --> 00:51:20,840
he invited her to a drug party on purpose to get revenge.

694
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:25,950
But he's wealthy, privileged, and everything. So everyone tried to cover up for him.

695
00:51:27,460 --> 00:51:31,100
Ah, right. You are not interested in such things, right?

696
00:51:34,310 --> 00:51:35,940
Hey, Kwon Jeong Rok!

697
00:51:37,820 --> 00:51:39,250
Yeah?

698
00:51:39,250 --> 00:51:41,590
What are you thinking about so deeply?

699
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:44,290
Nothing.

700
00:51:50,400 --> 00:51:53,300
 Oh Yoon Seo files suit 

701
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:00,570
 Top Star Oh Yoon Seo files suit against Mr. A,  a 3rd generation chaebol for stalking. Will there be a battle over the facts? 

702
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,400
 Top Star Oh Yoon Seo Summoned by the Prosecutor on Suspicion of Drug Use 

703
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:10,800
 A drug scandal? Drug test results came out negative and she got acquitted. 

704
00:52:10,800 --> 00:52:13,760
 I'm just curious what kind of relationship she had with that third generation conglomerate. 

705
00:52:13,760 --> 00:52:17,610
 It must be a fact that she was there, right? 

706
00:52:17,610 --> 00:52:22,380
 He would put drugs in my drink every single time. 

707
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,490
Sorry?

708
00:52:35,970 --> 00:52:39,980
What do you mean, I should take my hands off Seung Hee's case?

709
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:44,150
I think that car accident case I told you about before is more critical than this one.

710
00:52:44,150 --> 00:52:47,710
I think you better find case precedents for traffic accidents within school grounds.

711
00:52:47,710 --> 00:52:50,900
But you told me to do it by next week though.

712
00:52:52,950 --> 00:52:57,000
Perhaps, you don't think I'm capable of doing this, do you?

713
00:52:57,000 --> 00:52:59,020
You're worried that I won't be much help?

714
00:53:00,290 --> 00:53:01,150
It's not that but—

715
00:53:01,150 --> 00:53:04,250
She spilled her story because she trusted me.

716
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:07,330
I want to help her in some way.

717
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:11,310
And I got a call earlier that they'd give us the CCTV data of him trespassing.

718
00:53:11,310 --> 00:53:14,730
So I'm going to her neighborhood to get it.

719
00:53:16,860 --> 00:53:19,000
Please believe in me

720
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,660
and entrust me with it, okay?

721
00:53:24,570 --> 00:53:28,430
Then, I will take it as a yes.

722
00:53:39,220 --> 00:53:42,580
I should've come to the law firm.

723
00:53:43,230 --> 00:53:45,320
No, you're good.

724
00:53:45,320 --> 00:53:49,400
You must have a lot of things on your mind,  but please cheer up.

725
00:53:49,400 --> 00:53:54,180
Our Mr. Lawyer will resolve this case somehow for sure.

726
00:53:55,180 --> 00:53:58,140
I hope so.

727
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:02,260
This is it.

728
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,350
Then, I will be waiting here.

729
00:54:05,350 --> 00:54:08,740
Why don't you come inside? It's freezing out here.

730
00:54:08,740 --> 00:54:11,680
Shall we?

731
00:54:17,860 --> 00:54:20,840
Wait a moment. I will bring my USB.

732
00:54:40,530 --> 00:54:42,810
What's wrong, Secretary Oh?

733
00:54:44,370 --> 00:54:47,440
Seung Hee, let's talk for a second. Come here.

734
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:52,780
- No matter how much I think about it, I don't think I can break up with you. Stay still. 
 - Who are you?

735
00:54:52,780 --> 00:54:56,970
- Let's talk.
 - Let this go. Seung Hee doesn't want to.
 - You stay out of this. Ugh!

736
00:54:56,970 --> 00:55:01,690
Hey, you know I love you, Seung Hee. I love you so much. I don't think I can break up with you.

737
00:55:01,690 --> 00:55:06,540
- I told you, I just need a second. Let's talk for just a minute.
 - Please don't do this, please!

738
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:10,030
I told you to stay put, didn't I?

739
00:55:12,070 --> 00:55:14,250
Who is this? Ow...

740
00:55:42,200 --> 00:55:45,980
How did it go? Are you sure I don't need to go myself?

741
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:50,550
Yes. I was questioned as a witness and as the representative of the complainant.

742
00:55:50,550 --> 00:55:55,280
Right. That guy installed that CCTV in front of Seung Hee's house himself.

743
00:55:55,280 --> 00:55:59,980
That's why he was able to find out the new passcode to her house whenever she reset it.

744
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:06,500
He's been summoned by the police on charges of illegal filming and trespassing.

745
00:56:06,500 --> 00:56:10,170
So I think we will definitely be able to get a restraining order.

746
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:12,410
What a relief.

747
00:56:15,910 --> 00:56:20,120
By the way, what brought you there out of the blue?

748
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:26,200
Well, I wanted to look at the scene and hear about the evidence.

749
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:29,480
Then I suddenly heard you screaming.

750
00:56:32,030 --> 00:56:34,510
- Are you alright? 
- Sorry?

751
00:56:34,510 --> 00:56:37,230
It seemed like you were quite startled earlier.

752
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,960
I'm okay now.

753
00:56:41,970 --> 00:56:45,560
Then, it's all settled, right?

754
00:56:45,560 --> 00:56:50,660
If he gets the restraining order, he won't show up again, right?

755
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:53,840
Correct. You don't need to worry.

756
00:56:59,910 --> 00:57:06,170
Stealing someone else's personal life and forcing his feelings on someone else one-sidedly is definitely wrong.

757
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:13,230
I think people who do those bad deeds should suffer, not the victims.

758
00:57:14,030 --> 00:57:18,320
So, don't suffer anymore. Try to forget bad memories quickly.

759
00:57:18,320 --> 00:57:23,700
You have to live happily. For your own sake. Do you understand?

760
00:57:24,590 --> 00:57:27,620
What made you say such...

761
00:57:30,130 --> 00:57:33,260
Well, it's nothing.

762
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:42,780
Mr. Lawyer! You got an injury on your neck. Oh, my goodness.

763
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:59,100
I'm really okay.

764
00:57:59,100 --> 00:58:01,430
I'm not okay with it.

765
00:58:01,430 --> 00:58:04,170
If you look at it, you got hurt because of me.

766
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:08,590
I would feel uneasy if you leave without getting your wound treated properly.

767
00:58:08,590 --> 00:58:11,060
I will apply it myself then.

768
00:58:11,060 --> 00:58:15,100
You know, I once was a main character in a medical drama.

769
00:58:15,100 --> 00:58:18,680
Perhaps, did you watch it? It's called Romantic Doctor.

770
00:58:18,680 --> 00:58:21,670
- No, I didn't watch it. 
 - I should have known.

771
00:58:21,670 --> 00:58:27,050
Anyway, I was the most competent surgeon in this country.

772
00:58:28,250 --> 00:58:31,660
But does that have anything to do with cleaning and applying ointment on the injury?

773
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:37,540
Of course. Take a good look at how professional I am with cleaning the wound.

774
00:59:01,130 --> 00:59:06,850
If it's making you uncomfortable, would you like to put this ointment on yourself?

775
00:59:08,100 --> 00:59:09,640
No.

776
00:59:10,460 --> 00:59:13,130
You do it personally.

777
00:59:16,090 --> 00:59:19,450
You said you've had a doctor role before.

778
00:59:21,230 --> 00:59:22,780
Yes.

779
01:00:53,140 --> 01:00:59,320


780
01:01:10,220 --> 01:01:13,760

♫  Honestly, it's hard for me  ♫

782
01:01:19,560 --> 01:01:23,410
♫   Whether it's what the timing is or  ♫

783
01:01:23,410 --> 01:01:27,480
 Mr. Lawyer! You've had such a hard day today again. 

784
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:30,690
♫  My slow moving heart  ♫

785
01:01:30,690 --> 01:01:33,700
 Oh Jin Sim, you must have been really shocked today. 

786
01:01:33,700 --> 01:01:37,900
 And thank you 
 for saving me.

♫  I'm here.  Are you waiting for something?  ♫

789
01:01:47,850 --> 01:01:51,850
 Thank you for taking care of my wound. 

790
01:01:51,850 --> 01:01:56,330
 To make sure your injury doesn't get worse, make sure you apply the ointment in the morning, alright? 

791
01:01:56,330 --> 01:01:59,690
 Apply it once in the afternoon and once at night, alright? 

792
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:05,780
 It's not that I'm worried. It's just out of responsibility since you got hurt because of me. 
 - Sure, sure.

793
01:02:05,780 --> 01:02:08,770
 I'm a person with a strong sense of responsibility. 

794
01:02:08,770 --> 01:02:14,290
 I will put ointment on diligently for a quick recovery so I won't worry Ms. Oh Jin Sim with a strong sense of responsibility. 

795

 Have a sweet dream.

 You have a sweet dream, too, Ms. Oh Jin Sim.

01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,120
 Good morning. It's so cute, isn't it? 

809
01:03:34,120 --> 01:03:36,640
 Too much pink in a law firm office is a bit... 

810
01:03:36,640 --> 01:03:39,190
 - I'm coming, I'm coming!
 - Kwon Jeong Rok! 
- Come on, hurry! 

811
01:03:39,190 --> 01:03:42,100
 You are a really bad person, Mr. Lawyer! 

812
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,450
 I'm here to see Ms. Oh Jin Sim. 

813
01:03:44,450 --> 01:03:47,190
 Today, for some reason,  I'm looking upon work in a half-hearted manner. 

814
01:03:47,190 --> 01:03:50,370
 I am mad at you because...! 

815
01:03:50,370 --> 01:03:53,950
 Now that I look at it, you haven't ever dated properly. You've pretty much been single for life and— 

816
01:03:53,950 --> 01:03:54,920
 Stop it already. 

817
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:58,360
 It feels so nice to go for a drive for the first time in a long time. 

818
01:03:58,360 --> 01:04:00,370
 We are on our way to a jail. To work. 

819
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:04,910
 We, Always, got a huge case. 

820
01:04:04,910 --> 01:04:08,390
 Since you've made a promise, you should make sure you keep it.
