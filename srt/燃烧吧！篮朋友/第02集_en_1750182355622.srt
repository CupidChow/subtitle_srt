1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How to sing your dream?

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll draw the sky with my love

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let everything be a dream

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the dark night

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How to forget the memory

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It turns out to be a kind of memory

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't be afraid

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen to the sound of your tiger and your cat

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't be afraid to wake up in the water

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Let the cat become a secret

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Protect me and you

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How to forget the memory

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It turns out to be a kind of memory

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't be afraid

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How to forget the memory

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It turns out to be a kind of memory

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't be afraid

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Listen to the sound of your tiger and your cat

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't be afraid to wake up in the water

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Let the cat become a secret

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Protect me and you

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
The End

26
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
I know

27
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
I'll give it to him

28
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,000
No need

29
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Just take it

30
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Say it, it's okay

31
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
It's okay

32
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You two are really animals

33
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Here you are

34
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Then I'm not客气

35
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
You are so good

36
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,000
A cross-dress

37
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,000
A back-up

38
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,000
A three-point-tower

39
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I'm happy

40
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
You are so good

41
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What's going on?

42
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'll go see

43
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Lao Zhang, I'm back

44
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Hurry up and eat

45
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Where is Yao Yao?

46
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Her parents came back from Singapore

47
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
She went to eat

48
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I said

49
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
As long as this child doesn't come to eat

50
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
It's because the family came back

51
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I haven't seen her friends go out to play

52
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Have you seen her?

53
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Yes

54
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
Really few

55
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
But she's tall

56
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
But she'll have friends soon

57
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Report

58
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Our class has a girl

59
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
She is not big

60
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
But she has more power than many boys

61
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
Congratulations to her

62
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Finally have friends

63
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
By the way

64
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yao Yao said that tomorrow is Friday

65
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Her father wants us to go to Bo Yue hotel to eat

66
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Where is my mom?

67
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:56,000
Another class?

68
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,000
Isn't it?

69
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Let's eat first

70
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
After eating

71
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
I'll go to the company to pack her

72
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
After the afternoon, there is a detailed report of the father

73
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I will definitely be able to work hard

74
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
You are so ugly

75
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Go

76
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Go

77
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Why do you listen to that school?

78
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
You are a baby

79
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
What's wrong with you?

80
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
We are neighbors

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
We live next door

82
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
We met at the door

83
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
How about this?

84
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,000
You should have said it

85
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
You didn't ask me

86
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
I still have some regrets

87
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
What are you regretting?

88
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
I regret that I didn't forgive her yesterday

89
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I'm so lonely

90
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,000
You must be so lonely

91
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I remember the wind

92
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:03,000
In a place where I can't find

93
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I want to learn Yao Yao

94
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I have long liked Shun Liang

95
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Look

96
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
I regret it

97
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I regret it

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I'm lonely

99
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I'm so lonely

100
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I remember the wind

101
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:48,000
In a place where I can't find

102
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
I want to learn Yao Yao

103
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
I remember the wind

104
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,000
In a place where I can't find

105
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:57,000
I want to learn Yao Yao

106
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,000
In a place where I can't find

107
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,000
I want to learn Yao Yao

108
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,000
I remember the wind

109
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
In a place where I can't find

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
There are two words

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:12,000
that are very profound

112
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There are two words

113
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Can I ask you something?

114
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
The chicken in the long air

115
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
and the box in front of the fish

116
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
Can we analyze it?

117
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Where are you the last two words?

118
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,040
Hello Madam落

119
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:28,880
Are you Moderna.

120
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,360
Sure

121
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,560
There is an important는데

122
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:31,400
It will be later

123
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,680
It's launched

124
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:36,000
Hi

125
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,080
All right

126
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,280
The water is clear

127
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,560
What a fool!

128
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,040
From all aspects,

129
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,360
What ainate!

130
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,760
It's worth a shot!

131
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,720
Which classmate knows

132
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,080
why humans have to use this?

133
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,160
Dodoors open?

134
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,240
Docole open?

135
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:23,840
Oh my god

136
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,360
What

137
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:28,800
What can you draw

138
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:32,320
Sounds are all enjoying

139
00:09:32,520 --> 00:09:34,440
Let me tell you why she is like this

140
00:09:35,560 --> 00:09:36,960
Sir, I know

141
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,960
She said she's dumb

142
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,640
But she is确 teilweise

143
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,560
That's why she won't understand

144
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,560
So she will ask

145
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,520
Shut up

146
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,300
Hey, leaving work.

147
00:09:49,360 --> 00:10:14,480
Looking for good کூ

148
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:16,160
It's about luck and friendship.

149
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,120
世然不可能不集體問題似情

150
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:21,600
世人通過學問大棧的勝處榮譜

151
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,640
人間是阻斷

152
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:42,160
The next class is about to fill in.

153
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,320
It's okay to have a match.

154
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,840
I practiced and ran.

155
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,920
It's all like this.

156
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:47,240
So it's nothing.

157
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,480
But I've been back to my position

158
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,000
after taking a class.

159
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,240
What's your future?

160
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:55,880
Your gap with me.

161
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:59,040
My gap with you is

162
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:00,840
you and my classmate are different.

163
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,840
Your classmate is Wen Zhiyang.

164
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:06,920
My classmate is Zhu Dongdong.

165
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,960
What are you talking about?

166
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:11,840
You're stupid after taking a class.

167
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:15,240
Zhu Dongdong is far from Wen Zhiyang.

168
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,040
I'm not.

169
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,280
You're not the one who

170
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,280
reminded me of where I was.

171
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,200
Today,

172
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:26,560
I'll send you to Wen Zhiyang

173
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:27,920
and have a good training.

174
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:31,080
Study hard and keep up the good work.

175
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:33,960
Welcome to the business training.

176
00:11:34,520 --> 00:11:35,200
Training?

177
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:36,280
I'm here for you.

178
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,000
Shaowei, what are you doing?

179
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:39,640
Go, go, go.

180
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,480
Go.

181
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:41,320
Zhu Dongdong.

182
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:44,800
Can you come to the office with me?

183
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,440
There are two police officers

184
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:48,400
to find out about the situation.

185
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:49,720
Mr. Zeng.

186
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,680
Police?

187
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,560
What's wrong with the hairpin?

188
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,520
Shaowei, shut up.

189
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,680
Shaowei,

190
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:15,600
I don't care what Zhu Dongdong

191
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,520
took away from me.

192
00:12:16,520 --> 00:12:18,000
I don't believe he's such a person.

193
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,280
Yes, I don't believe him either.

194
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:20,560
I just asked around.

195
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:21,720
I said there's someone.

196
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:22,520
Someone said

197
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,160
he's not only busy with his own family,

198
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:25,760
but also wants to touch his own little brother.

199
00:12:26,280 --> 00:12:27,280
He's still not going to fight.

200
00:12:27,840 --> 00:12:28,640
Zhang Wei,

201
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:30,520
you believe him?

202
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,920
He's just like Daoyao Cai.

203
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,800
He'll fight.

204
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,720
He's just as proud as usual.

205
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,640
He'll steal things.

206
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,120
Me too.

207
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,840
As his colleague,

208
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,080
I think he's a good person

209
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,680
and he's also a good person for him.

210
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,840
You're still very excited.

211
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:50,080
Of course.

212
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,040
I won't be wrong.

213
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,440
And he's also my friend.

214
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,080
Do you think he's a good person?

215
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,000
After that,

216
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
I think he's not a bad person.

217
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:04,640
I believe him.

218
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,560
Yao Yao.

219
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:13,560
Miss Yan,

220
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,440
her thoughts might change.

221
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,680
Because...

222
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,240
These are all rumors.

223
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:25,440
Miss Yan,

224
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,640
you don't need to know.

225
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,720
Luckily,

226
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:31,240
you also know

227
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:32,920
how bad and bad

228
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,000
some acrylic paints are.

229
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:37,520
I fully care your side.

230
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:39,000
to tell Zhu Dongdong

231
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:42,240
Zhu Dongdong is very, very, very good

232
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,640
Although he is not very good-natured

233
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:45,880
and very kind

234
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,520
But we are making a report

235
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:49,920
He is a very kind child

236
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:53,040
So if the police need any witness

237
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,840
We are willing to stand up and testify for him

238
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:56,000
Give him a kiss

239
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:02,240
Ok, I know

240
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,360
You go to class first, ok?

241
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,640
Let's go back first

242
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:08,240
Ok

243
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:32,040
Sir

244
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:34,120
Go back to your seat

245
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:34,720
Ok

246
00:14:38,520 --> 00:14:39,520
Ok

247
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,520
I will go back first

248
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,920
Let's go, Zhou Yue, take the ball

249
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:00,920
No, Zhou Yue

250
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:02,520
We should send Yao Yao first

251
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,320
Send Yao Yao to the school gate first

252
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:05,520
Anyway, there is a group

253
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
It's ok, go and play

254
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:10,520
He is right

255
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,520
I know there is a little girl in the school gate

256
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,520
There is no one in the group

257
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:14,520
Let's go there

258
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,520
Ok

259
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:16,520
Ok

260
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,520
Dongdong, take the ball back together

261
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:19,520
No

262
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,520
I am a little girl

263
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,520
Like a wind of a road

264
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:13,520
How can we grow together

265
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,520
Sorry, sorry

266
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:19,520
Come to me

267
00:16:21,520 --> 00:16:22,520
Why are you here?

268
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:24,520
Fang Xue is being called by the class

269
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,520
I didn't call you

270
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:27,520
Are you running here?

271
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,520
Have some water

272
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:30,520
Thank you

273
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:31,520
Thank you

274
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:34,520
I don't have water

275
00:16:35,520 --> 00:16:36,520
I am Jiao Xin

276
00:16:36,520 --> 00:16:37,520
You are a group

277
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,520
I don't have water

278
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:40,520
I am just a hand

279
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,520
Look at my head

280
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:43,520
Take the ball back

281
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,520
Here

282
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:49,520
No

283
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:51,520
I can only use this

284
00:16:53,520 --> 00:16:55,520
Wei, this is the C-shaped number

285
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:56,520
Who are you?

286
00:16:56,520 --> 00:16:57,520
I am a professional

287
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,520
Ok

288
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,520
Let's take a break

289
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,520
Let's play later

290
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:02,520
Ok

291
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:04,520
Go

292
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:08,520
Xiaodan

293
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,520
I think the basketball game is good

294
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:11,520
Did you start playing since you were young?

295
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:13,520
Yes, I like basketball

296
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,520
I like this one more

297
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,520
You know how to play basketball

298
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,520
You know how to play basketball

299
00:17:29,520 --> 00:17:30,520
I have a friend

300
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,520
He is a master of basketball

301
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,520
Really?

302
00:17:32,520 --> 00:17:34,520
Then introduce him to me next time

303
00:17:34,520 --> 00:17:36,520
Please call him

304
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:39,520
I didn't meet

305
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,520
a friend who knows basketball

306
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:41,520
I learned these moves

307
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,520
on the Internet

308
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:44,520
That's great

309
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:47,520
But

310
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:49,520
I'm curious

311
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
Why do you like basketball

312
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:52,520
as a girl?

313
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,520
Do you remember the spring of 2008?

314
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,520
I was very young at that time

315
00:17:58,520 --> 00:18:00,520
I played basketball on the spring night

316
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,520
I liked it when I saw it

317
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:04,520
Since then

318
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,520
I will practice basketball when I have time

319
00:18:06,520 --> 00:18:09,520
You are a child

320
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,520
Yue, are you done with your study?

321
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:14,520
Let's play basketball

322
00:18:14,520 --> 00:18:15,520
Go

323
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,520
Zhang Wuren

324
00:18:22,520 --> 00:18:23,520
One for me

325
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,520
Come on, Zuo Yue

326
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:30,520
Good ball

327
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:33,520
Good ball

328
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:36,520
Come on, Zuo Yue

329
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:41,520
Zhang Wuren, come on

330
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,520
Three

331
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,520
Zuo Yue, come on

332
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:45,520
Good ball

333
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,520
Yes, you can

334
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,520
Shennan, one for you

335
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:48,520
One for me

336
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:50,520
Yes, Shennan

337
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,520
Yes

338
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:00,520
Go

339
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:15,520
Is he back?

340
00:19:16,520 --> 00:19:17,520
Mom

341
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:18,520
Why are you back so late?

342
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:21,520
I just played basketball

343
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,520
Are you hungry?

344
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,520
I will leave you some food

345
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:31,520
Your dad is busy today

346
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:32,520
He is working

347
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:33,520
He is not home

348
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:35,520
Mom, I'm hungry

349
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
I will make you some food

350
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:45,520
Here, try some chicken feet

351
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:48,520
It's delicious

352
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,520
It's really delicious

353
00:19:52,520 --> 00:19:53,520
Mom

354
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,520
I'm back so late today

355
00:19:54,520 --> 00:19:56,520
You can go

356
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:01,520
I hope you can grow up healthy

357
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:03,520
and happy

358
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,520
Or my dad is so smart

359
00:20:12,520 --> 00:20:13,520
Mom

360
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,520
We are having a meeting at school

361
00:20:16,520 --> 00:20:17,520
Really?

362
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
What happened to you and mom?

363
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:30,520
Go

364
00:20:53,520 --> 00:20:54,520
Hey

365
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,520
Nope

366
00:20:57,520 --> 00:20:59,520
Do you have anything else you like?

367
00:21:00,800 --> 00:21:01,520
What?

368
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,520
Come here to talk.

369
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:05,920
Please, bro.

370
00:21:05,920 --> 00:21:07,520
You should tell me about it.

371
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,440
I decided to tell you

372
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,800
about the secret of your love.

373
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:15,640
Since you're so modest,

374
00:21:16,040 --> 00:21:17,640
I'll tell you about it.

375
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:19,000
Say it.

376
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:19,840
He

377
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,360
likes to listen to songs.

378
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:23,320
Listen to songs?

379
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:26,320
You're so weak.

380
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,440
I can't do it.

381
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,040
Then I won't let you sing.

382
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:33,480
It's so hard to get close.

383
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,440
I know it's hard to get close.

384
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,080
What?

385
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,840
He's being pointed again today?

386
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,440
What do you mean by that?

387
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:44,800
He's been rejected every day.

388
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:46,000
Bro,

389
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:47,840
good luck.

390
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,560
Good luck.

391
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:51,600
Bye.

392
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:28,440
What's wrong?

393
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:42,520
Dongdong,

394
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:43,680
do you mind if we sit here?

395
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:45,440
No.

396
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,600
Dongdong,

397
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,120
we're worried

398
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,160
about you.

399
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,760
Especially the guy in Shengnan.

400
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:56,720
What's wrong with Shengnan?

401
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,200
He saw you were taken away.

402
00:22:59,320 --> 00:23:00,400
He immediately asked us to meet him.

403
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:02,120
He went to the director

404
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,240
to do some administrative work.

405
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:06,680
How did he say that?

406
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:08,720
As his colleague,

407
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,920
I believe he's a human being.

408
00:23:10,080 --> 00:23:11,760
I'm willing to prove his innocence.

409
00:23:11,920 --> 00:23:12,600
Yes.

410
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:13,920
He really said that?

411
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,280
Many people heard it?

412
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:17,720
It's okay.

413
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,200
It's okay.

414
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:20,000
Dongdong,

415
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:21,760
listen to me.

416
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,840
I'm so proud of my uncle.

417
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:25,160
Everyone knows that I'm a colleague.

418
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,120
I'm a good friend.

419
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:28,560
I won't send you

420
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,680
to Wenjiyao

421
00:23:29,680 --> 00:23:30,720
to accompany you

422
00:23:31,040 --> 00:23:32,080
to work.

423
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:33,800
You're the most convenient

424
00:23:33,800 --> 00:23:34,520

425
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:35,760
Come on.

426
00:23:35,920 --> 00:23:36,600
Tell me

427
00:23:36,600 --> 00:23:37,600
what happened.

428
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,800
I only knew

429
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:46,800
Dongdong found a car

430
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:49,400
and a fake plane.

431
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:51,440
He reported to the police

432
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:52,800
on the first day.

433
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:55,800
The police came here

434
00:23:56,120 --> 00:23:58,120
to show Dongdong's

435
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:59,120
strong will

436
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,480
and publicize the evidence

437
00:24:01,480 --> 00:24:02,480
in front of the school.

438
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:12,840
It's the sun.

439
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,240
The sky is clear.

440
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:15,360
The wind is strong.

441
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:16,560
It means that

442
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,400
the weather is very cold and hot.

443
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:19,440
The wind is strong.

444
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:20,800
It makes people feel good.

445
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:21,840

00:24:22,560 --> 00:24:23,680
