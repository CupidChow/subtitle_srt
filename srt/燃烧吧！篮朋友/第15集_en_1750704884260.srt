1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,600
But the heart, the hug has become a secret

2
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:08,600
Protecting you and me

3
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,800
The question is, if this is your favorite voice

4
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:25,800
How come I can't forget you

5
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,000
So love is a kind of luck, don't give up

6
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Listen, that's your favorite voice

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How come I can't forget you

8
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:43,000
So love is a kind of luck, don't give up

9
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Listen, that's the sound of breathing

10
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
In the silence, it's a surprise

11
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
But the hug has become a secret

12
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,200
Protecting you and me

13
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:58,200
The Legend of Chusen

14
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,200
Episode 15

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,800
This place is noisy.

16
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,800
Yes, this place is very painful.

17
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,800
Everyone has it.

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,000
How about we change to another place and look for it?

19
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,600
How about we stay here first?

20
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:39,800
Let's settle here first. Training is important.

21
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,400
When the time is up, we'll look for another place.

22
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,200
I'll make you guys suffer first.

23
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,800
This place is also very good. When I was young,

24
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:49,800
I was already very satisfied without such a ballpark.

25
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,800
That's right.

26
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:58,000
God can only decide what kind of person he is.

27
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,880
Why did people come over?

28
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,200
No idea.

29
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,400
Hua Hua Xiang

30
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,540
She has MAN対就跟 관련你

31
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:17,840
ispersing what is real

32
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,320
I couldn't kill her

33
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:19,960
No

34
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:21,360
Who're you

35
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:23,400
I'm just a makeover

36
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:23,920
You

37
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,080
surprised her

38
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:26,480
'I just've been seaweeding

39
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:27,880
you for too long

40
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:29,320
look at me

41
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,260
And Iano

42
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,840
Don't separate us

43
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,480
I want to be together

44
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:35,640
You knowаем

45
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,880
she killed a man

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,160
She killed a man

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,280
recall what's important

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,480
Let them find me

49
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:43,560
Give me the phone

50
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:44,360
Give it to me

51
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,400
Stop!

52
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,760
Stop chasing!

53
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,840
Jian, who is he?

54
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,040
Who is he?

55
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:06,040
Who do you think he is?

56
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,960
I always think he's not that important.

57
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,280
Otherwise, Jian wouldn't be like this.

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,000
I think so too.

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,800
I don't know if Jian will be in trouble.

60
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:21,120
I'm quite worried.

61
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,400
You should think of something.

62
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,720
Don't be so stubborn.

63
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,200
You've been talking for the whole afternoon.

64
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,240
You should go and check it out yourself.

65
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,440
As the saying goes,

66
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,120
the top is the top, the bottom is the bottom.

67
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,000
You should be grateful for this.

68
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:37,520
Right.

69
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,920
We can't ask anything.

70
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,120
Instead of guessing,

71
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:41,280
we should go and check it out.

72
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:42,640
Are you going or not?

73
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,120
I'm sure I'll go.

74
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,640
Then we'll go after school.

75
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:47,760
Come on!

76
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:49,120
Practice for a while.

77
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,480
Class is about to start.

78
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,160
Come on!

79
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:51,920
Be careful.

80
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,440
Be careful.

81
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,760
Hang in there.

82
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:58,640
Class is about to start.

83
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:01,640
It's done.

84
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,960
It's done.

85
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:06,400
Go to your parents.

86
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:07,400
Class is over.

87
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:09,600
Go.

88
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:10,320
I'm coming.

89
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,200
Goodbye, Mr. Du.

90
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:12,400
Goodbye.

91
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:13,320
Goodbye.

92
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:13,960
Goodbye.

93
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,800
Goodbye.

94
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,480
Goodbye.

95
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,280
Goodbye.

96
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,240
Goodbye.

97
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,200
Goodbye.

98
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,120
Goodbye.

99
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Goodbye.

100
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,560
You two have been here for a long time.

101
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,000
What's wrong?

102
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,600
We just want to know

103
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:29,320
if you know Wang Zi Jian.

104
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,480
Is there any misunderstanding?

105
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,760
If so,

106
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,880
explain it.

107
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,800
It's none of your business.

108
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,960
Wang Zi Jian is my captain.

109
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,440
Why does it have nothing to do with me?

110
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:43,960
adapter

111
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,220
I beg you

112
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:53,320
don't come to this place again.

113
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:56,040
There's a leave.

114
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,920
What?

115
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:00,840
It's not necessary.

116
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,600
Get back in term limits and have your account友metal check in.

117
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,200
Okay.

118
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,240
What does she want?

119
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:21,640
Don't know what to do next.

120
00:06:23,320 --> 00:06:24,320
What's going on?

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,160
I want to know too.

122
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,360
We can't just go in there.

123
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,040
We need to find a chance to talk to Jian.

124
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:33,680
See if he needs our help.

125
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,320
You're right.

126
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,000
With him like this,

127
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,360
I don't know how to talk to him about this.

128
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:41,440
I'm afraid to talk to him,

129
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,000
and I'm afraid to touch the place he doesn't want to talk about.

130
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:46,760
What should I do?

131
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:48,360
If this doesn't work out,

132
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,720
I'm still worried.

133
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,360
Let's think about it tonight.

134
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:55,760
It's late. Let's go home.

135
00:06:55,760 --> 00:06:57,040
Or Uncle Shi will talk about it.

136
00:06:58,080 --> 00:06:59,240
That's the only way.

137
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,200
Hello, Jian.

138
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,160
Hello, Yue.

139
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,160
I'm looking for you.

140
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,160
What's up?

141
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,040
Jian,

142
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:48,820
is the

143
00:07:53,320 --> 00:07:54,400
injury okay?

144
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,000
I'm fine.

145
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,520
Okay.

146
00:07:58,520 --> 00:07:59,880
Let's start the weekend training.

147
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,160
Jian,

148
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:02,320
what's up?

149
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:04,760
Well...

150
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:07,520
It's none of your business.

151
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,600
Please don't come to this place again.

152
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:13,480
What did you say just now?

153
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,920
There's a good thing.

154
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:17,800
I'll treat you to barbecue tomorrow.

155
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:18,800
Okay.

156
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,800
Thank you, Jian.

157
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:20,600
See you tomorrow.

158
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,320
See you tomorrow.

159
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,000
I'll get you one,

160
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,240
alright?

161
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:42,000
Let's do it together.

162
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,320
This hired me today.

163
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:44,280
I'm delighted.

164
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:45,280
Thank you, Jian.

165
00:08:48,280 --> 00:08:49,360
Jian,

166
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,400
you called us here today

167
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:55,000
Could it be that the lottery is suddenly won?

168
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:58,000
If the lottery is won, I can treat you to barbecue.

169
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,900
Wang Zi Jian I know is not that petty.

170
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:03,400
Brother Jian, tell me. What's going on?

171
00:09:03,400 --> 00:09:05,800
Why are you so mysterious?

172
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,000
Brother Jian.

173
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,500
I got scholarship.

174
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:15,800
You got scholarship?

175
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,400
You got scholarship for your grades in the university?

176
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,300
I really got scholarship.

177
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:23,400
The kind of student in the sport of solar energy.

178
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,400
I don't believe it.

179
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,400
I don't believe it either.

180
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:29,200
I know you don't believe it.

181
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Come on, Bao Bao.

182
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,400
Look. Look at what this is.

183
00:09:43,700 --> 00:09:47,500
This... Is this real?

184
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:49,300
It seems to be real.

185
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:51,100
And it's covered with a stamp.

186
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:54,900
I can't really do it again.

187
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,100
Just because I am excellent...

188
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,600
and reliable.

189
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,100
I led our basketball team to win the championship.

190
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,500
So the school sent me this.

191
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:07,900
Okay. Okay. Okay.

192
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:08,900
Good.

193
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:12,300
When will you also lead us to participate in the competition?

194
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:15,200
Let us make some money too.

195
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:16,800
I was talking about this with Zhou Yue yesterday.

196
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:18,500
Just wait.

197
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,800
That's great.

198
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:23,300
Then I will train with you tomorrow for the next competition.

199
00:10:23,300 --> 00:10:25,000
Shengnan, don't just think about training.

200
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:25,800
Come on, eat more.

201
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:27,500
Okay. Come on, Shengnan.

202
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,200
Thank you, Sister-in-law.

203
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,700
It's delicious.

204
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:35,800
We have to find a chance to talk with Brother Jian.

205
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:37,800
See if he needs our help.

206
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:39,400
You're right.

207
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:43,200
If this thing doesn't work out, I'm still not at ease.

208
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:47,600
Brother Jian.

209
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,100
We actually want to ask you something.

210
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:53,400
I don't know if it's convenient for you to tell me.

211
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:03,200
It's about the last time we were on the empty field.

212
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,400
What's wrong?

213
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,400
That empty field...

214
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:13,000
The conditions are indeed a bit poor.

215
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:15,400
I just got my scholarship.

216
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:18,400
I will definitely find a suitable place next time.

217
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
Come on, Zhou Yue.

218
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,800
Eat more. Don't just look at it.

219
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:21,800
Zhou Yue, come on.

220
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:23,700
You eat too.

221
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:25,100
It's delicious.

222
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,700
Zhou Yue.

223
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,200
Eat some.

224
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:31,100
Zhou Yue.

225
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,600
Come on, everyone, drink some.

226
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:48,100
URL

227
00:11:48,580 --> 00:11:49,580
What if it's fake?

228
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,420
oro

229
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,420
Hello, He Yu

230
00:12:16,420 --> 00:12:17,700
It's hard to find the time.

231
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:19,380
I asked my friend for it.

232
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:20,660
You can use it.

233
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,780
Thank you, Zeyue.

234
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,980
You really have no heart and no lungs.

235
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:30,660
It's okay.

236
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,180
You can continue to read it.

237
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,460
That's it.

238
00:12:34,220 --> 00:12:34,780
Bye.

239
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:45,780
Zeyue.

240
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:47,540
I know what you want to say today.

241
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:49,300
Don't mention this person again.

242
00:12:49,620 --> 00:12:50,220
Remember.

243
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:02,340
Last night,

244
00:13:02,580 --> 00:13:03,500
Jonah told me

245
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:05,740
not to mention this person

246
00:13:05,740 --> 00:13:06,540
in front of Jiange again.

247
00:13:07,980 --> 00:13:09,620
They seem to have some problems.

248
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,140
And it's not a small thing.

249
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,340
Maybe.

250
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,700
Okay, I know.

251
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,980
I won't ask too many questions.

252
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:18,860
Let's train normally.

253
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,860
I don't know if I can meet this person today.

254
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,820
He should come here often.

255
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,580
Let's talk about it later.

256
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:26,260
It's none of his business.

257
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,820
What are you talking about?

258
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:32,500
Brother Jian.

259
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:35,540
This place is not ideal.

260
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:36,700
But I believe

261
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:38,580
I can find a better place.

262
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:39,940
You can train at ease.

263
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,180
Shengnan,

264
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:42,420
our team competition

265
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,220
should be one month earlier than your individual competition.

266
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,780
When I come back after the competition,

267
00:13:45,980 --> 00:13:47,620
you will go to the individual competition soon.

268
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,100
You can't relax

269
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:50,300
when I'm not here.

270
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,180
You should practice more.

271
00:13:51,940 --> 00:13:53,100
I know, Brother Jian.

272
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:54,540
You can go to the competition without worry.

273
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:56,180
We have no problem.

274
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:58,940
Zeyue,

275
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,620
the video you sent me yesterday

276
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,540
is very cool.

277
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,740
And there are many masters.

278
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:04,300
It's good that you like it.

279
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,500
What video?

280
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:08,100
You two have little secrets again.

281
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,980
Just some video games.

282
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,300
I'll send it to you if you want.

283
00:14:11,820 --> 00:14:12,900
You two

284
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,980
have too many secrets.

285
00:14:15,300 --> 00:14:15,860
Wait for it.

286
00:14:16,020 --> 00:14:17,060
I'll tell you one by one.

287
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,020
Today,

288
00:14:19,220 --> 00:14:20,660
in order to punish you two,

289
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:21,700
I must

290
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:23,540
show you a high-intensity move.

291
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,460
Okay.

292
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:26,180
I like high-intensity moves the most.

293
00:14:26,860 --> 00:14:27,340
Shengnan,

294
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,900
are you suffering?

295
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:30,340
I'm not.

296
00:14:31,580 --> 00:14:32,300
I think

297
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:33,660
if you get the result

298
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:34,540
in the national competition,

299
00:14:34,820 --> 00:14:36,260
Zhou Yue will be happier than himself.

300
00:14:36,340 --> 00:14:36,980
Okay.

301
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,060
Let's get started.

302
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,300
Have you seen this person?

303
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:41,940
No.

304
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,340
He's about this tall.

305
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,340
He's wearing a pink jacket

306
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:45,260
and short hair.

307
00:14:45,420 --> 00:14:45,980
No.

308
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:48,100
He seems to be looking for someone.

309
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:49,300
She's my grandma.

310
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,300
She ran away from home.

311
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,620
Thank you.

312
00:14:53,340 --> 00:14:54,020
Jian,

313
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:56,580
I think you care about him.

314
00:14:56,740 --> 00:14:58,180
If you have any misunderstandings,

315
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,420
you'd better solve it

316
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:01,460
in case you leave yourself with regrets.

317
00:15:07,420 --> 00:15:08,020
Hao Xiang,

318
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,500
is grandma having an affair again?

319
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,340
I'll help you find her.

320
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:11,420
Me too.

321
00:15:11,940 --> 00:15:12,580
Me too.

322
00:15:13,740 --> 00:15:14,700
You...

323
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:18,020
Tell me.

324
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:19,100
Which way did you run?

325
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:23,620
Wang Zi Jian, come back.

326
00:15:24,580 --> 00:15:25,460
Wang Zi Jian.

327
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,380
Wang Zi Jian.

328
00:15:27,900 --> 00:15:29,180
Wang Zi Jian, come back.

329
00:15:33,180 --> 00:15:34,060
I'll find her myself.

330
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:38,500
Hao Xiang's grandma has a dementia.

331
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:39,700
She often ran away from home.

332
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:41,700
She has a bad temper

333
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,460
and is anxious.

334
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:43,780
How could she find her?

335
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:47,060
I have her grandma's photo in my phone.

336
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:47,940
I'll send it to you.

337
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,860
You can find her together.

338
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,100
Contact me if you have any news.

339
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,380
Hello.

340
00:15:56,660 --> 00:15:58,900
Have you seen this grandma in the picture?

341
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:00,500
Have you seen this old lady?

342
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:03,260
No.

343
00:16:04,940 --> 00:16:05,820
Excuse me.

344
00:16:06,140 --> 00:16:08,180
Have you seen this grandma in the photo?

345
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,020
Have you seen this old lady?

346
00:16:10,140 --> 00:16:11,540
Excuse me, I haven't.

347
00:16:11,660 --> 00:16:13,140
Have you seen this old lady?

348
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:15,060
Little girl,

349
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:16,420
have you seen this old lady?

350
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,700
No.

351
00:16:19,220 --> 00:16:21,380
Have you seen this old lady in the picture?

352
00:16:24,220 --> 00:16:25,540
Have you seen this old lady?

353
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:26,420
No.

354
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:27,420
Hello.

355
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:29,180
Have you seen this old lady?

356
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,380
I haven't seen her.

357
00:16:39,060 --> 00:16:40,540
Thank you for finding my grandma.

358
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,340
If it weren't for Jian,

359
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,380
we couldn't

360
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:44,940
bring your grandma home.

361
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:47,740
I heard that you played basketball together.

362
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,020
Yes.

363
00:16:49,220 --> 00:16:51,700
What's wrong with you now?

364
00:17:03,340 --> 00:17:04,700
When I was in high school,

365
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:07,060
he and I were the best partners.

366
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:10,700
We played basketball together for three years.

367
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,060
You played well today.

368
00:17:15,820 --> 00:17:16,740
You're not tired?

369
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,820
Listen,

370
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,380
you're just a beginner.

371
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:20,500
Don't try so hard.

372
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:21,980
What's wrong?

373
00:17:22,100 --> 00:17:23,580
Why do you care about me so much today?

374
00:17:26,500 --> 00:17:28,300
I never care about you.

375
00:17:28,740 --> 00:17:29,820
You have to pay attention.

376
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:31,660
Don't just enjoy it.

377
00:17:31,780 --> 00:17:32,900
You have to appreciate it.

378
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:35,140
I'm not bad.

379
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:36,980
When did you see me

380
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:38,220
saying that I couldn't participate in the game

381
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,500
because I was sick?

382
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,740
I mean,

383
00:17:43,900 --> 00:17:45,940
you should get well first if you're injured.

384
00:17:46,140 --> 00:17:47,620
Don't delay the game.

385
00:17:47,940 --> 00:17:49,620
You're right.

386
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:51,980
You can understand.

387
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:54,380
I'm right.

388
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,620
How dare you attack me?

389
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:00,420
You...

390
00:18:06,140 --> 00:18:07,140
You...

391
00:18:18,660 --> 00:18:20,180
Okay, let's gather first.

392
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:25,780
Well,

393
00:18:25,900 --> 00:18:27,020
please introduce yourself.

394
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:28,620
Hello,

395
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,460
I'm Xu Kai from Class One Class Three.

396
00:18:30,740 --> 00:18:32,900
I used to be a good player.

397
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:34,540
I just joined the school team.

398
00:18:34,540 --> 00:18:36,140
I hope you can give me some advice.

399
00:18:39,300 --> 00:18:40,580
Let's train together first.

400
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,460
What position do you want to play?

401
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,660
Let's wait for the coach to decide.

402
00:18:43,660 --> 00:18:44,300
Okay.

403
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,860
The new player looks like he has a few chances.

404
00:18:51,380 --> 00:18:52,740
I don't think so.

405
00:18:52,740 --> 00:18:55,980
I heard from the coach that this person is very strong.

406
00:18:56,820 --> 00:18:58,380
If it weren't for our graduation,

407
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,380
the team would not have found him.

408
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:03,780
And he said he would play the back.

409
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:04,940
Isn't this a strong position?

410
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:07,100
He said that,

411
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:08,220
I just listened.

412
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,820
The foundation looks pretty good.

413
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:14,500
You should care about yourself first.

414
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,420
How's your knee?

415
00:19:20,020 --> 00:19:21,260
No problem.

416
00:19:21,260 --> 00:19:22,420
You like to be worried.

417
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,660
Don't ask me next time.

418
00:19:26,540 --> 00:19:27,180
Ball.

419
00:19:28,540 --> 00:19:29,540
Hold tight.

420
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,660
Hurry up.

421
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:35,660
We can run away as soon as possible.

422
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,620
What's up, what's up?

423
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:44,740
What are you coming so late?

424
00:19:45,260 --> 00:19:47,460
Our Demon Slayer, Liu Tang.

425
00:19:47,460 --> 00:19:49,100
I have no idea.

426
00:19:49,100 --> 00:20:03,880
First, leave 100

427
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,140
Jia—

428
00:20:23,900 --> 00:20:26,360
He's going to be fine. He just had to be here.

429
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:28,380
So annoying.

430
00:20:29,680 --> 00:20:31,800
100 body-till jumps just to show his ambition.

431
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:34,500
He's always late. Guang mantian can't be scripted.

432
00:21:04,500 --> 00:21:05,860
Great.

433
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:36,980
Shaohoodwa is down.

434
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:45,700
He is trying to attack us.

435
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:54,300
They have others!

436
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,940
paísesh!

437
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:58,780
How can you play against us?

438
00:21:58,780 --> 00:21:59,780
How can you play?

439
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,180
It's a friendly match. Don't be so angry.

440
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:06,980
I'm so angry.

441
00:22:06,980 --> 00:22:08,580
Did he figure out what he's doing?

442
00:22:18,980 --> 00:22:20,780
We're six points behind Chao Yang.

443
00:22:20,780 --> 00:22:22,980
We must win the second half.

444
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:24,580
Although it's a friendly match,

445
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,980
Lin Jiang never lost to Chao Yang.

446
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,380
Xu Kai, you play the second half.

447
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:31,180
Zhou Tian, you play.

448
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:35,380
Captain, I'm the substitute again.

449
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:37,980
Captain means you should rest first.

450
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:40,180
You have to cooperate with us for a long time.

451
00:22:40,180 --> 00:22:41,980
It's easier to get points.

452
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:44,380
And it's the most important to win the match.

453
00:22:45,180 --> 00:22:47,580
Xu Kai, you just joined the team.

454
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:49,980
You should be more understanding and cooperate with us.

455
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:52,380
I'll arrange this match first.

456
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,980
Others, hurry up and warm up.

457
00:22:54,980 --> 00:22:57,980
Okay, captain. It's up to you.

458
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:08,180
What attitude?

459
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:09,780
He's the one who said it on the court, right?

460
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:12,380
It's good that he didn't sit on the cold bench this time.

461
00:23:13,180 --> 00:23:15,380
He's a handsome guy when he first came on the court.

462
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,780
How many points did he lose?

463
00:23:16,780 --> 00:23:17,980
What's so good about him?

464
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:19,380
He played well.

465
00:23:19,380 --> 00:23:20,780
He's got a good foundation.

466
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,380
He's just a handsome guy.

467
00:23:22,380 --> 00:23:23,380
He's handsome.

468
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,780
All newbies are like this.

469
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,180
If he had done this earlier,

470
00:23:26,180 --> 00:23:27,580
he could have been kicked out of the team.

471
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:29,780
I'm so bad at this.

472
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:31,180
You're really angry.

473
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:32,380
Not really.

474
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:33,580
When I came,

475
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:35,380
I always had a fight with you.

476
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,980
It's normal for newbies to come.

477
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,980
Basketball is mainly a team sport.

478
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:42,780
It's not important to win or lose by yourself.

479
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,180
Let's treat him well later.

480
00:23:46,980 --> 00:23:48,780
Have you been talking lately?

481
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:51,580
I'm doing this for the sake of the team's harmony and stability.

482
00:23:52,780 --> 00:23:53,780
You...

483
00:23:59,180 --> 00:24:00,380
Look at him.

484
00:24:00,380 --> 00:24:02,580
He's left behind nothingness and energy.

485
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:05,380
I don't want Lingjiang's g squeaking at my hands.

486
00:24:05,580 --> 00:24:07,780
You should help me to go in.

487
00:24:08,380 --> 00:24:09,380
Okay,amp.

488
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:12,380
And you should give more importance to the bruises on your legs.

489
00:24:12,380 --> 00:24:13,180
I think you just did...

490
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:14,380
You can rest assured.

491
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,980
I've occurred Hence

492
00:24:17,180 --> 00:24:18,580
This game will be fine.

493
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,980
It's good that

494
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:23,380
Of course.

495
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:24,940
Take a break, captain.

496
00:24:27,140 --> 00:24:29,380
We won Chaoyang in the last friendly match.

497
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:30,980
Everyone did well.

498
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,460
But...

499
00:24:33,260 --> 00:24:35,820
There's not much time left for the national competition.

500
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:37,700
We can't be careless.

501
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:39,580
Let's train harder

502
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:41,620
and do our best for the final.

503
00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,540
Yes.

504
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,660
Does your injury hurt?

505
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,860
It's a small injury.

506
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:54,340
You just put on the ointment and sprayed yourself.

507
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:55,820
It's not a big deal.

508
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:58,260
You can go to the hospital later.

509
00:24:58,940 --> 00:25:00,540
Don't be so cocky, captain.

510
00:25:00,700 --> 00:25:02,300
It's not a big deal.

511
00:25:10,820 --> 00:25:12,820
You don't have to come to the training tomorrow.

512
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:14,340
Go to the hospital first.

513
00:25:15,660 --> 00:25:16,740
Are you kidding me?

514
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:20,100
This is the last game of my high school.

515
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,060
I have to put on a perfect symbol

516
00:25:22,060 --> 00:25:23,620
for my high school career.

517
00:25:27,620 --> 00:25:29,460
Okay, I'll listen to you.

518
00:25:31,220 --> 00:25:34,980
Go, go, go!

519
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:38,620
Go, go, go!

520
00:25:38,620 --> 00:25:43,620
Go, go, go!

521
00:25:43,620 --> 00:25:48,620
Go, go, go!

522
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:52,620
Go, go, go!

523
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:55,740
Our opponents today are Hu Ling and Zhong Xue.

524
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:57,740
They are good at double-hitting.

525
00:25:57,980 --> 00:25:58,980
Everyone faces them.

526
00:25:58,980 --> 00:26:00,180
Keep calm.

527
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:01,380
Don't be too agitated.

528
00:26:01,620 --> 00:26:03,540
We'll play as we used to.

529
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:06,420
Remember to keep our ability to play as we used to.

530
00:26:06,420 --> 00:26:07,020
Come on.

531
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:07,820
Go for it!

532
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,860
Time is up.

533
00:26:15,580 --> 00:26:16,980
Time is up.

534
00:26:17,380 --> 00:26:18,860
I'm not baby.

535
00:26:19,260 --> 00:26:21,100
They到底 know what they are doing.

536
00:26:21,380 --> 00:26:22,380
Belatedly.

537
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:23,140
Yes.

538
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:37,860
Don't give up,

539
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:40,940
national team without a notice.

540
00:26:40,940 --> 00:26:42,460
It's said to be extraordinary.

541
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

542
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

543
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:48,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

544
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:50,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

545
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

546
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

547
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:56,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

548
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:58,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

549
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

550
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

551
00:27:02,460 --> 00:27:04,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

552
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:06,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

553
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

554
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:10,460
I'm going to the bathroom.

555
00:27:10,460 --> 00:27:12,460
青春小鸟早早明觉

556
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:14,460
青春小鸟早早明觉

557
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:16,460
青春小鸟早早明觉

558
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:18,460
太阳躲在云里睡觉

559
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,460
我走在街上 喊着小鸟

560
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:22,460
我走在街上 喊着小鸟

561
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:24,460
到街边的小店 逃逃

562
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:26,460
到街边的小店 逃逃

563
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,460
秋蝉王王闹是喧闹

564
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:30,460
秋蝉王王闹是喧闹

565
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:32,460
太阳刚刚转个蓝腰

566
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:34,460
太阳刚刚转个蓝腰

567
00:27:34,460 --> 00:27:36,460
