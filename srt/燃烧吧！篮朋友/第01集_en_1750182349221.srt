Usually, the most thing she says to me is

43
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:12,000
A girl should do what a girl should do

44
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
What can you do to a boy?

45
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,000

Why do you have to say such a thing?

00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Wait

00:08:40,540 --> 00:08:41,180
it's okay.

197
00:08:41,180 --> 00:08:42,660
I said I can't?

198
00:08:42,780 --> 00:08:43,780
You can?

199
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,780
I thought you were kidding.

200
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,780
I knew it after I hit you.

201
00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:50,780
Why are you standing there?

202
00:08:50,780 --> 00:08:51,780
Move out first.

203
00:08:51,780 --> 00:08:52,780
Okay.

204
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:53,780
We'll finish the rest.

205
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,780
Wait for us at the playground.

206
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:55,780
See you at the basketball court later.

207
00:09:03,780 --> 00:09:04,780
There are so many people.

208
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:05,780
I'm going to the playground.

209
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,780
They're fighting.

210
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:17,780
Let's go.

211
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,780
Hurry up.

212
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,780
That way.

213
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,780
Hey, classmate.

214
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:37,780
Let me help you.

215
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:38,780
No need.

216
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:39,780
It's okay.

217
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:41,780
Why do girls have so many books on their own?

218
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:42,780
Let me do it.

219
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:43,780
I said it.

220
00:09:43,780 --> 00:09:44,780
No need.

221
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:45,780
You're so good at it.

222
00:09:45,780 --> 00:09:46,780
Let's go.

223
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:47,780
I'll take you to the entrance.

224
00:09:47,780 --> 00:09:48,780
Let's go.

225
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,780
Classmate,

226
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:52,780
you're a high school student, right?

227
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:53,780
What's your name?

228
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:55,780
Which class are you in?

229
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:57,780
What are you in?

230
00:09:57,780 --> 00:09:58,780
Let me tell you.

231
00:09:58,780 --> 00:10:00,780
The best food in our school is

232
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,780
the one with the best food.

233
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:02,780
And that...

234
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,780
The one with the best service.

235
00:10:04,780 --> 00:10:05,780
I'll buy it for you next time.

236
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,780
Are you sure?

237
00:10:07,780 --> 00:10:08,780
Where's your home?

238
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:10,780
There are so many bad people around our school.

239
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,780
I'll send you there.

240
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,780
You're giving me back the book?

241
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,780
Wen Zhiyao?

242
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:15,780
You lost the last one, right?

243
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,780
Yes.

244
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,780
Give it to me.

245
00:10:23,780 --> 00:10:24,780
Wen Zhiyao?

246
00:10:29,780 --> 00:10:30,780
Dongguan,

247
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,780
go and get my key.

248
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:32,780
Go and get my key.

249
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,780
What?

250
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,780
I'll say it again.

251
00:10:34,780 --> 00:10:35,780
The last time,

252
00:10:35,780 --> 00:10:36,780
get my key.

253
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:37,780
I don't believe you.

254
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:39,780
Who?

255
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,780
Me.

256
00:10:41,780 --> 00:10:42,780
Dongguan, you're a good teacher.

257
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,780
You're in the top three.

258
00:10:44,780 --> 00:10:46,780
Aren't you afraid of winning the college entrance exam?

259
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:56,780
You're playing basketball, right?

260
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,780
Play a game.

261
00:10:58,780 --> 00:11:00,780
You want to use basketball

262
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,780
to beat me?

263
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:02,780
What?

264
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,780
You dare not play with me?

265
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:06,780
If you win,

266
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,780
you can count on it.

267
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,780
If you lose,

268
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,780
you must apologize to him today.

269
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,780
Fine.

270
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,780
Whoever loses,

271
00:11:13,780 --> 00:11:14,780
I'll get back to the classroom

272
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,780
from the basketball court.

273
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:16,780
Come on.

274
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,780
But

275
00:11:23,780 --> 00:11:25,780
you two are in the middle of the game.

276
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,780
You two are the ones

277
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:29,780
who will play 3V3 with us.

278
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:32,780
The first person to lose

279
00:11:32,780 --> 00:11:33,780
is me.

280
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,780
I can do it.

281
00:11:44,780 --> 00:11:45,780
Bro,

282
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:46,780
do you know how to play?

283
00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:49,780
I just put the ball on the sky.

284
00:11:49,780 --> 00:11:50,780
If you don't know how to play,

285
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:52,780
you'll be in trouble.

286
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,780
Jiang Xin,

287
00:12:02,780 --> 00:12:03,780
go and have a look.

288
00:12:03,780 --> 00:12:04,780
Let's beat a classmate

289
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:06,780
and a young man.

290
00:12:06,780 --> 00:12:07,780
Don't be anxious.

291
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:08,780
We're so strong.

292
00:12:08,780 --> 00:12:10,780
Tell me what's going on.

293
00:12:10,780 --> 00:12:12,780
Zhu Dongdong and Ren Zheng are fighting.

294
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:14,780
Lin Shengnan is playing there.

295
00:12:14,780 --> 00:12:15,780
Look at me.

296
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,780
I'm so good to you.

297
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:17,780
I'll tell you when I get back.

298
00:12:17,780 --> 00:12:18,780
What are you thinking?

299
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,780
Go.

300
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,780
See what's going on.

301
00:12:20,780 --> 00:12:22,780
I need to be more confident with you.

302
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:24,780
Things are going to be better.

303
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,780
There's no problem in playing basketball.

304
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,780
But I'm not good at playing basketball.

305
00:12:28,780 --> 00:12:29,780
I can't blame you.

306
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,780
I was the one who made the bet.

307
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:32,780
I made the bet.

308
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,780
I'm the one who made the bet.

309
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:34,780
I'm the one who made the bet.

310
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,780
The result is my own.

311
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,780
Your main task today

312
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,780
is to help the police.

313
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,780
The principle of helping the police

314
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:39,780
is to never touch

315
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:40,780
the enemy's main body.

316
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:42,780
Do you understand?

317
00:12:44,780 --> 00:12:45,780
I don't know.

318
00:12:52,780 --> 00:12:53,780
Nice shot.

319
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:54,780
Nice shot.

320
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:55,780
Nice shot.

321
00:12:55,780 --> 00:12:56,780
Nice shot.

322
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:57,780
Nice shot.

323
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:00,780
Good bro.

324
00:13:20,780 --> 00:13:21,780
Bring the serve in.

325
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:26,780
Good line.

326
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,780
Good, good line.

327
00:13:27,780 --> 00:13:28,700
Go for it.

328
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,700
He's going to fight!

329
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,700
Why does Zhou Yue fight alone in this situation?

330
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:47,700
Actually, I think Shennan is quite good.

331
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:50,700
He's actually quite good at Yang Chengbi.

332
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,700
He knows his own style.

333
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:54,700
He can't be forced to fight.

334
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,700
He's fighting with his legs and legs.

335
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:00,700
I think he's also better than him.

336
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:03,700
We'll fight for the best.

337
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,700
Good ball!

338
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:08,700
What are you doing?

339
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:10,700
Come on!

340
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,700
Come on!

341
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,700
Come on!

342
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,700
Come on!

343
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
Come on!

344
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:16,700
Come on!

345
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,700
Come on!

346
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:18,700
Come on!

347
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:19,700
Come on!

348
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,700
Come on!

349
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:21,700
Come on!

350
00:14:21,700 --> 00:14:22,700
Come on!

351
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:23,700
Come on!

352
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:24,700
Come on!

353
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,700
Come on!

354
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:26,700
Come on!

355
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,700
Come on!

356
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,700
Come on!

357
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:29,700
Come on!

358
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:30,700
Come on!

359
00:14:30,700 --> 00:14:31,700
Come on!

360
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,700
Come on!

361
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:33,700
Come on!

362
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,700
Come on!

363
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:36,700
Come on!

364
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,700
Come on!

365
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,700
Come on!

366
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:43,700
Your main task today is to defend the gold medal.

367
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,700
Don't fight.

368
00:14:45,700 --> 00:14:47,700
As long as you don't touch the opponent's main body,

369
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:49,700
try to hurt the opponent.

370
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:50,700
Come on!

371
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,700
Come on!

372
00:14:51,700 --> 00:14:52,700
Come on!

373
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:53,700
Come on!

374
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,700
Come on!

375
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,700
Come on!

376
00:14:55,700 --> 00:14:56,700
Come on!

377
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,700
Come on!

378
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,700
Come on!

379
00:14:58,700 --> 00:14:59,700
Come on!

380
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:00,700
Come on!

381
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,700
Come on!

382
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,700
Come on!

383
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,700
Fan Gui!

384
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,700
Dong Dong, are you okay?

385
00:15:06,700 --> 00:15:07,700
Are you okay, Dong Dong?

386
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:09,700
You're okay.

387
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,700
We're...

388
00:15:11,700 --> 00:15:12,700
I'll pass the pass to you.

389
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,700
You go to Dong Dong's side.

390
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:15,700
Pay attention to the gold medal.

391
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:16,700
Wait for him to get hurt.

392
00:15:16,700 --> 00:15:17,700
You go back to the stadium.

393
00:15:17,700 --> 00:15:18,700
Okay, I'll...

394
00:15:19,700 --> 00:15:20,700
Come on!

395
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:21,700
Come on!

396
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:23,700
Come on!

397
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,700
Come on!

398
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:01,700
Come on!

399
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:02,700
Come on!

400
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:03,700
Come on!

401
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,700
Fan Gui!

402
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,700
Fan Gui!

403
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,700
Are you okay?

404
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,700
The current ball is on our side.

405
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:19,700
The hope of winning is still big.

406
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,700
We have to be more stable.

407
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:21,700
Xiaoyu.

408
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,700
I just got out of the wind.

409
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,700
What?

410
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,700
You should cooperate with me this time.

411
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,700
Come on!

412
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,700
Come on!

413
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,700
Come on!

414
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:31,700
Come on!

415
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:32,700
Come on!

416
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:33,700
Come on!

417
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:34,700
Come on!

418
00:16:34,700 --> 00:16:35,700
Come on!

419
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:36,700
Come on!

420
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,700
Come on!

421
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:38,700
Come on!

422
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,700
Come on!

423
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,700
Come on!

424
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:41,700
Come on!

425
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,700
Come on!

426
00:16:47,700 --> 00:16:48,700
Come on!

427
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:49,700
Come on!

428
00:16:49,700 --> 00:16:50,700
Come on!

429
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,700
Come on!

430
00:17:15,700 --> 00:17:16,700
Come on!

431
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:17,700
Come on!

432
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,700
Come on!

433
00:17:19,700 --> 00:17:20,700
Come on!

434
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,700
Come on!

435
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,700
Come on!

436
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:29,700
Come on!

437
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
You are so good.

438
00:17:31,700 --> 00:17:32,700
What? You don't believe me?

439
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:33,700
No.

440
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:34,700
I'm a bit risky.

441
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,700
You win.

442
00:17:35,700 --> 00:17:36,700
You are right.

443
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,700
Nan,

444
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,700
you are so good.

445
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
You just got injured.

446
00:17:40,700 --> 00:17:41,700
I'm willing to help you.

447
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,700
Tell me.

448
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,700
How do you run?

449
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,700
What else?

450
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:46,700
What else?

451
00:17:50,700 --> 00:17:51,700
What else? Tell me.

452
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,700
We can win this time.

453
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,700
Not because we are in good health.

454
00:17:55,700 --> 00:17:56,700
But

455
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:59,700
our brother Zhou is not bad.

456
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,700
So how should we punish him?

457
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,700
I'll listen to him.

458
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,700
Since it's like this,

459
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:10,700
I'll punish you.

460
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,700
One person is ten.

461
00:18:14,700 --> 00:18:16,700
Then apologize to Dongdong.

462
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,700
We'll meet in the stadium.

463
00:18:18,700 --> 00:18:19,700
We can do it together.

464
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:21,700
It's so easy.

465
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,700
Okay.

466
00:18:24,700 --> 00:18:25,700
Brother,

467
00:18:25,700 --> 00:18:26,700
I was wrong today.

468
00:18:27,700 --> 00:18:28,700
Be serious.

469
00:18:34,700 --> 00:18:35,700
I'll count to one.

470
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,700
Two.

471
00:18:36,700 --> 00:18:37,700
Three.

472
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:38,700
Four.

473
00:18:38,700 --> 00:18:39,700
Five.

474
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:40,700
Six.

475
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,700
Seven.

476
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:42,700
Eight.

477
00:18:42,700 --> 00:18:43,700
Nine.

478
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,700
Nine and five.

479
00:18:45,700 --> 00:18:46,700
Ten.

480
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,700
Okay.

481
00:18:51,700 --> 00:18:53,700
I'm lucky to have you today.

482
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,700
I didn't expect you would play.

483
00:18:55,700 --> 00:18:57,700
I didn't expect you to play so well.

484
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,700
I'll be sure to be your brother.

485
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,700
Keep teaching me.

486
00:19:00,700 --> 00:19:01,700
Okay.

487
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,700
What should we do?

488
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
The newspaper.

489
00:19:37,700 --> 00:19:38,700
Will you win this afternoon?

490
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,700
Why are you not here yet?

491
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,700
Too many people.

492
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,700
I don't want to go.

493
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,700
Yes.

494
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:49,300
I didn't bring you any presents.

495
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:50,620
It's okay.

496
00:20:10,540 --> 00:20:11,100
Grandma.

497
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,060
What are you doing?

498
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,180
Why are you back so late?

499
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:15,940
Mom, I went to play football.

500
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:17,180
I had some time to take care of it.

501
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,140
Stop.

502
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,860
What are you doing?

503
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,820
I went to play football.

504
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:23,860
You played football?

505
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,900
What's wrong with playing football?

506
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,620
I'm also in school.

507
00:20:27,620 --> 00:20:29,660
You dare to mention school to me?

508
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:31,260
School is the first day of school.

509
00:20:31,260 --> 00:20:31,540
You're late.

510
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,460
You're not going home.

511
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:33,940
You're only coming back now.

512
00:20:33,940 --> 00:20:35,620
You're so educated.

513
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,260
How are you going to get into college in the future?

514
00:20:39,460 --> 00:20:40,660
I'm not going to get into college.

515
00:20:40,660 --> 00:20:41,500
What?

516
00:20:41,820 --> 00:20:43,060
You're not going to college.

517
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:44,660
How can you find a good job?

518
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:49,780
Why do you want to get married

519
00:20:49,780 --> 00:20:51,900
after you're in college?

520
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,860
Why do you want to live like you?

521
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,500
Lin, Lin.

522
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:55,900
Xiao Xiaoqi.

523
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,220
The kid just got into high school.

524
00:20:57,220 --> 00:20:58,740
How can you let him have a try?

525
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:01,220
I want to play basketball.

526
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,460
I don't like learning.

527
00:21:03,820 --> 00:21:04,740
Say it again.

528
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:07,100
I want to play basketball.

529
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,020
I don't like learning.

530
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:19,020
Why are you looking at me?

531
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,100
What are you doing?

532
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:30,300
From today on,

533
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:31,260
as long as you're in school,

534
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,860
you'll have to study hard in your room.

535
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,940
You can't go anywhere.

536
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,700
Why?

537
00:21:34,700 --> 00:21:35,700
Why should I listen to you?

538
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:36,700
I'm your father.

539
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:20,260
ress

540
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:22,800
Sir,

541
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:27,220
somebody sick?

542
00:22:32,940 --> 00:22:33,500
Auntie.

543
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:34,620
Get up and bed.

544
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,700
You'll be late.

545
00:22:39,940 --> 00:22:41,260
You're up, granny.

546
00:22:42,620 --> 00:22:44,320
Why don't you get up and pack your stuff?

547
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,900
After you finish storage,

548
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:46,740
Go home.

549
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,080
You are often missed by your wife and son.

550
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,760
K perí.

551
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:49,980
I'll definitely find a dad for myself.

552
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,780
If you go home with your husband...

553
00:22:51,800 --> 00:22:53,640
She'll be away from you.

554
00:22:57,420 --> 00:22:58,920
While your songs are playful...

555
00:22:58,940 --> 00:23:00,820
Maybe someoned she will be...

556
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:02,420
Lose you,

557
00:23:02,440 --> 00:23:06,320
Because I lost love to you

558
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,060
Grandma.

559
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,960
Happy,vision達達.

560
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,560
Mom,

561
00:23:12,580 --> 00:23:13,860
Love is cute.

562
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,960
I'm still missiles

563
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,600
that are frightening me,

564
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,800
I can choose my own speed today.

565
00:23:18,800 --> 00:23:21,300
Do you know that I have a lot of dark circles now?

566
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:23,340
Well, I don't know.

567
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:25,860
Is that so interesting?

568
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:29,240
I wonder if you are good at remotely assigning a human field.

569
00:23:29,240 --> 00:23:30,940
That sounds pretty similar.

570
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,040
Mom, my dad is angry now.

571
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,400
Where does one get a troubleshooting disorder?

572
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:42,860
Your dad is angry but you come here to be happier.

573
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,460
Five

574
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,140
Bye

575
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,020
Tan?

576
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,500
What can I do for you?

577
00:24:05,780 --> 00:24:06,780
Let's go

578
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:13,860
I'm not going.

579
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,860
You bought so much.

580
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,860
Isn't this for the students?

581
00:24:24,860 --> 00:24:25,860
I want to buy more.

582
00:24:28,860 --> 00:24:30,860
He doesn't like snacks.

583
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:33,860
Then he likes snacks.

584
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,860
I'm not that kind of person.

585
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,860
I'm just kidding.

586
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,860
You really like milk?

587
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,860
Who?

588
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:54,860
Who does he like?

589
00:24:59,860 --> 00:25:00,860
He likes milk.

590
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,860
Then I'll go buy it.

591
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:03,860
Sit down.

592
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:05,860
Zhao Mei.

593
00:25:06,860 --> 00:25:07,860
I'm not telling you.

594
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:10,860
You know that there are many people who love to drink.

595
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,860
Why are you so mean?

596
00:25:13,860 --> 00:25:14,860
I'm just pretending to be kind.

597
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:17,860
If you're a high-ranking flower,

598
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:18,860
you can't be far from me.

599
00:25:19,860 --> 00:25:20,860
He's really kind.

600
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:21,860
He's not high.

601
00:25:21,860 --> 00:25:22,860
I'm so good to you.

602
00:25:23,860 --> 00:25:25,860
He's not only a kind person.

603
00:25:25,860 --> 00:25:26,860
He's pure.

604
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,860
He doesn't like to hit you.

605
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:29,860
Wei.

606
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,860
Give it to me.

607
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,860
My friend.

608
00:27:12,860 --> 00:27:13,860
My friend.

609
00:27:42,860 --> 00:27:43,860
My friend.
