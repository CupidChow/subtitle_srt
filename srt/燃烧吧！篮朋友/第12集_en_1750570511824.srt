1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,640
But the heart

2
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:04,800
turns into a secret

3
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,640
to guard you and me

4
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:23,000
The sound of your favorite

5
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:26,000
I can't forget you

6
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,040
Love is an excuse

7
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:31,080
Don't give up

8
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,080
Listen, that's your favorite voice

9
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,080
I can't forget you

10
00:01:38,080 --> 00:01:41,080
Love is an excuse

11
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,080
Don't give up

12
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,080
Listen, that's the voice that calls you

13
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:50,080
The heart doesn't stop beating

14
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:53,080
But the hug turns into a secret

15
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:56,080
to guard you and me

16
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,040
Love is an excuse

17
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Don't give up

18
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,040
Listen, that's your favorite voice

19
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,040
I can't forget you

20
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:45,040
Love is an excuse

21
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,040
Don't give up

22
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,040
Listen, that's your favorite voice

23
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:55,040
I can't forget you

24
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,040
Love is an excuse

25
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,040
Don't give up

26
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,040
Listen, that's your favorite voice

27
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,040
I can't forget you

28
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Love is an excuse

29
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,040
Don't give up

30
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,040
Listen, that's your favorite voice

31
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,040
I can't forget you

32
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:24,040
Love is an excuse

33
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:27,040
Don't give up

34
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,040
I'm not worried about the exam

35
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,040
Because I won't

36
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,040
But now I know the questions

37
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:38,040
I'm more anxious

38
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:41,040
Because I don't know all

39
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:44,040
If you still have to study for so long

40
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,040
I'll be so disappointed

41
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:48,040
Lin Songnan

42
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:54,040
So annoying

43
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,040
I'm older than I am

44
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
I'm a mother

45
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,040
I'm quite aluminum

46
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,040
So annoying

47
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:08,040
Then I said

48
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,040
I did graduate room

49
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:12,040
After graduation

50
00:04:12,040 --> 00:04:12,580
Then I

51
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,040
Now I'm a mother

52
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,040
I still don't think of myself

53
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,040
ry

54
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,040
Lin Songnan

55
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:23,040
she doesn't love you

56
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,040
Sheately

57
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,040
I'm too sorry

58
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,040
I got 163 points this time.

59
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,040
I've made progress this time.

60
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,520
I can play with peace of mind now.

61
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,680
Why don't you get 200 points?

62
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:36,040
Please.

63
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,400
I got 163 points this time.

64
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,600
What's wrong with us?

65
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,840
The score is too low.

66
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:42,520
I'm satisfied anyway.

67
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:43,960
This time,

68
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,200
the score is higher than the one in the kindergarten.

69
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:48,520
I'll go to the next room to remember it later.

70
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,640
Naive.

71
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:51,640
I'll remember it

72
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,480
when I'm with you.

73
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:56,920
Okay.

74
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,960
Stop.

75
00:05:02,760 --> 00:05:04,360
Are you going to play again?

76
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:05,880
It's the weekend.

77
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,160
I want to play for a while.

78
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,440
What are you playing?

79
00:05:08,760 --> 00:05:09,720
You're in the second grade.

80
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,160
Why are you still so unruly?

81
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,280
Did I delay my studies?

82
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:16,120
Why can't I play

83
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,400
when I'm completing my studies?

84
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:18,600
Go to your room.

85
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,400
Give me the ball.

86
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,360
Why are you stealing my ball?

87
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:25,960
I...

88
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,880
If I don't stop you

89
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,400
and let you play every day,

90
00:05:31,560 --> 00:05:33,160
you can't even reach the university gate.

91
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,960
Why are you staring at me?

92
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,200
Did I say something wrong?

93
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,040
I'm asking you.

94
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,560
You...

95
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,400
I'm telling you.

96
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,400
Uncle thinks you didn't do well enough.

97
00:05:58,120 --> 00:05:59,400
If you listen to me,

98
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,520
I'll make one more question.

99
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,360
Li Zong Liang is not in the picture.

100
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,120
I won't lose to him.

101
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,600
Dongdong, do you still mind?

102
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,760
He's too bothered.

103
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,840
He's been forcing me to answer the questions.

104
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:13,320
People

105
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,280
always accept that they're mediocre.

106
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,320
Okay, okay.

107
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,520
I'll answer all of them.

108
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,720
I'll answer all of them.

109
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm not kidding.

110
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,400
Didn't you type the wrong answer?

111
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:28,840
Shengnan,

112
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:30,440
are you still training this time?

113
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:31,320
Of course.

114
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,600
Uncle doesn't talk about you.

115
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:35,080
We're not just playing or studying.

116
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:35,880
We're practicing.

117
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:36,520
Ignore him.

118
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,440
How about

119
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:40,200
you tell Uncle

120
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:41,240
to come out with me?

121
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,360
I haven't seen you play for a long time.

122
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:45,640
I want to go.

123
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:47,800
I'll just be honest.

124
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,200
I'm not obedient.

125
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,480
It's not right to lie.

126
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,600
But Yaoyao,

127
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:53,640
if you really want to go,

128
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:54,600
you're welcome.

129
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:56,840
Dongdong.

130
00:06:57,880 --> 00:06:58,440
Dongdong,

131
00:06:59,160 --> 00:06:59,960
come with me.

132
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:01,880
I don't have time.

133
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,520
Why would Dongdong come?

134
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:06,680
He's in a hurry to type the questions.

135
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:08,200
He's in a hurry to type the questions.

136
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:08,840
It's called

137
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:10,600
love can make up for it.

138
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:13,640
Zhou Mo, right?

139
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:15,640
I'll do it.

140
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,720
Love Can Make Up For It

141
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:46,440
Zhou Yue.

142
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:47,800
What's wrong?

143
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,080
Are you okay?

144
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:49,720
Don't move.

145
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:51,880
Which one?

146
00:07:51,880 --> 00:07:52,760
This one.

147
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,640
Which one?

148
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,520
Don't move.

149
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,680
Don't move.

150
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,320
Go to the hospital for a checkup.

151
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:57,960
Don't worry.

152
00:07:59,080 --> 00:07:59,640
Slowly.

153
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:00,120
Come on.

154
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:02,920
Walk slowly.

155
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:05,880
Come on.

156
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:19,160
Slow down.

157
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:23,800
Are you okay?

158
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:25,160
How are you?

159
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:25,800
Is everything okay?

160
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,440
What did the doctor say?

161
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,560
It's fine.

162
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,840
You're all covered.

163
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,360
Sorry, Zhou Yue.

164
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:33,320
I was distracted

165
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:34,680
and made you fall.

166
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,480
You need to rest for a while.

167
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,240
You can't go to the gym for at least half a month.

168
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,520
It's okay.

169
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,320
I won't blame you.

170
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,440
I'm injured from playing.

171
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:43,240
It's common.

172
00:08:43,240 --> 00:08:44,760
Half a month is

173
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,280
almost the end of the exam.

174
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:47,080
That's good.

175
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,600
You can just take the exam as a practice.

176
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:49,800
You can still improve your skills

177
00:08:49,800 --> 00:08:50,600
after this time.

178
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,560
Yeah.

179
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,520
Yeah.

180
00:08:52,520 --> 00:08:54,280
You can prepare for the exam.

181
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:55,560
Don't come to the training.

182
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:56,840
You've been injured for a hundred days.

183
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:58,040
Don't take it too seriously.

184
00:08:58,040 --> 00:08:58,760
Yeah.

185
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:00,600
It's lucky that we went to the hospital in time.

186
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,640
So there's nothing serious.

187
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:03,320
If something happens to you,

188
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:05,080
how can I tell your uncle and aunt?

189
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,320
Don't worry.

190
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,600
I'll take care of myself.

191
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:13,960
Uncle will be worried

192
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:15,160
if he sees you like this.

193
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:19,400
I've never seen any big waves in the old state.

194
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,840
I'm not

195
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,640
worried about him.

196
00:09:22,200 --> 00:09:23,480
Aunt, are you coming back?

197
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,560
I'll be back tonight.

198
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,040
Okay.

199
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,000
Let's not stand here.

200
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:29,640
Let's go.

201
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:31,880
Be careful.

202
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:38,280
Son.

203
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,240
Why are you so stiff?

204
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,760
Why did you twist your ankle?

205
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,960
It's okay, mom.

206
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,760
It doesn't hurt.

207
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:43,960
I just twisted it a little.

208
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,440
You're a kid.

209
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,280
I've told you many times.

210
00:09:48,280 --> 00:09:49,560
No matter what you do,

211
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,560
you must protect yourself first.

212
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:53,560
Look at yourself now.

213
00:09:53,560 --> 00:09:55,560
You make me and your mom worried.

214
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,440
Do you feel sorry for us?

215
00:09:57,720 --> 00:09:58,600
Zhou.

216
00:09:58,600 --> 00:09:59,560
What you said

217
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,360
seems like I'm deliberately

218
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:01,560
twisting my ankle.

219
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:05,160
Isn't it normal to have an accident when playing?

220
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,520
You're having an accident?

221
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,480
Shengnan's reaction today

222
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,080
is very clear to me.

223
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,800
It's a team.

224
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:16,760
You're having an accident or a hero.

225
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:17,880
You know it very well.

226
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,480
You two,

227
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:22,680
what's the point of playing?

228
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,120
Yue.

229
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,280
You like playing basketball.

230
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,800
I think it's good.

231
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,280
But you can't be so stubborn.

232
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,520
I agree with you playing basketball.

233
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,440
I want you to be well-rested.

234
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:40,200
I don't want you to get hurt.

235
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,280
Now is the time.

236
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,640
If something goes wrong with your body,

237
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,560
how can you take on the task?

238
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:50,760
You still want me to be a soldier?

239
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,440
Yes.

240
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,360
You must have a physical examination

241
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,720
when you want to be a soldier.

242
00:10:57,160 --> 00:10:58,600
You can't get through the pain

243
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,040
if you're injured.

244
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:01,640
But

245
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:03,800
no matter whether you have a physical examination or not,

246
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:05,800
you're the one who's injured

247
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,480
and you're the one who's being punished.

248
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,600
Yes.

249
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:09,880
Your mom is right.

250
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:14,680
But it's too tiring to be a soldier.

251
00:11:15,560 --> 00:11:16,920
When your dad was a soldier,

252
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,200
I was so worried

253
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,240
about you.

254
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,560
I didn't want you to suffer.

255
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:23,240
Son,

256
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,840
if you don't want to be a soldier,

257
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,680
you can study abroad.

258
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,440
I've arranged it for you.

259
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,680
Don't make any decisions.

260
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:35,000
Studying abroad is not good for being a soldier.

261
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:37,240
I don't have any decisions.

262
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:40,440
I have one more choice with Yue.

263
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:42,680
You can't be so stubborn.

264
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,760
What do you mean by being a soldier?

265
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,440
You can't be so stubborn

266
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:47,240
and be tired.

267
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,520
You can't be a good soldier

268
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,120
if you're suffering.

269
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:52,840
Dad, mom, stop arguing.

270
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,840
I can decide

271
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,040
my own life.

272
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:58,040
I'll go back to sleep.

273
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,000
Be careful.

274
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,920
I just came back.

275
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:12,680
I haven't talked to my dad.

276
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:14,600
Okay.

277
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,800
It's my fault.

278
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:17,880
It's my fault

279
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:19,240
to care about my son.

280
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:21,880
Jianguo,

281
00:12:21,880 --> 00:12:24,040
I know you love him.

282
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:25,240
Calm down.

283
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,000
By the way,

284
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:28,760
who is Shengnan

285
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:30,120
you just mentioned?

286
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,960
You didn't tell me last time.

287
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,680
She's Yue's classmate.

288
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,920
Do you know the boy or girl?

289
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,520
Is she related to Yue's injury?

290
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:41,080
I'm sleepy and going to sleep.

291
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,720
Yue's friends are not in the same class as mine.

292
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,400
Tell me now.

293
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,960
Excuse me.

294
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,760
Excuse me.

295
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,160
I'll back to work.

296
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:00,920
Arg!

297
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:11,160
Jianguo,

298
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:14,280
I've invested in a new project.

299
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:17,280
Do you remember the old man who worked with me?

300
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
The one who worked in the housing project?

301
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,240
Yes, Wang Zhenbang.

302
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:25,040
Yes.

303
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,600
He introduced me to a private fund.

304
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:31,240
He said he had a project

305
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,720
that could be listed in a year.

306
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,360
I'll have five times the profit.

307
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:40,320
But they lack funds now.

308
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,640
They want to pull me into the stock.

309
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,200
No.

310
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,400
You always ask for money.

311
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,480
You don't usually touch

312
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:52,920
the matter of pursuing high profits.

313
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,360
What else do they want to talk about?

314
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,800
The private fund, Wang,

315
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,760
has a door in a foreign university.

316
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,160
He said he could get a recommendation letter from a professor.

317
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,560
With this recommendation letter,

318
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,840
A Yue can apply for a school abroad.

319
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:11,560
They also promised

320
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,200
that A Yue would go abroad

321
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,440
and arrange a professional counseling department.

322
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,960
In this way,

323
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,040
we can save a lot of money.

324
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:29,040
You still want A Yue to study abroad.

325
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,880
Is it so good to study abroad?

326
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,560
I think

327
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:34,920
it's not worse than abroad

328
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,440
in China now.

329
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,680
A Yue is better at military school.

330
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,440
Jianguo,

331
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,320
young people now have their own wishes.

332
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,080
I think

333
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,680
in this society now,

334
00:14:49,280 --> 00:14:52,120
it's not a good thing

335
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,920
for young people to go abroad

336
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:57,040
and earn a lot of money.

337
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,080
I've worked hard all these years

338
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:00,520
just to make more foundation for A Yue's future.

339
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,640
I know your efforts.

340
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,600
But

341
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:09,920
I don't think I can

342
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,560
get the right answer.

343
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:13,880
Studying abroad

344
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:16,520
is not a good idea.

345
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,800
You're so generous.

346
00:15:21,080 --> 00:15:22,000
I think

347
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,400
Yao Yao should study abroad with him.

348
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,680
Yao Yao and he

349
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,360
grew up together.

350
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,800
They're in the same boat.

351
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:33,000
Yao Yao should study abroad with him.

352
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,640
I'm relieved.

353
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,680
There are two years left before A Yue's college entrance exam.

354
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,840
We'll talk about it tomorrow.

355
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:41,480
Li,

356
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,160
you're a good investor.

357
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,720
You can make a lot of money.

358
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:46,160
It's not easy for you to make some money.

359
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,120
Don't get confused

360
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:49,320
because A Yue studied abroad.

361
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:50,760
If you're impulsive,

362
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,200
you'll make a mess.

363
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:54,240
Dian Guang,

364
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:56,040
I know

365
00:15:56,400 --> 00:15:57,400
the business market.

366
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,760
Zhou Yi.

367
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,480
Yao Yao, let me get it.

368
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:15,640
Are you okay?

369
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:16,360
Can you walk?

370
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:17,760
Yes, I'm fine.

371
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:19,080
I can walk even if I'm confused.

372
00:16:28,440 --> 00:16:29,320
I'm fine.

373
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:30,320
I'm fine.

374
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,240
I'm fine.

375
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,080
I'm fine.

376
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:33,000
I'm fine.

377
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,080
I'm fine.

378
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,040
I'm fine.

379
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:35,960
I'm fine.

380
00:16:36,040 --> 00:16:36,880
I'm fine.

381
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:37,600
I'm fine.

382
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:38,440
I'm fine.

383
00:16:38,520 --> 00:16:39,440
I'm fine.

384
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:40,800
I'm fine.

385
00:16:41,400 --> 00:16:42,120
You...

386
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:42,880
You're a bad guy.

387
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,320
Can you stop being so arrogant?

388
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,400
That's right.

389
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,800
You'd better be more positive.

390
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:48,520
I'm fine.

391
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,200
Don't turn around for me.

392
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,600
I can walk by myself.

393
00:16:58,840 --> 00:16:59,600
Slow down.

394
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:01,080
Childish.

395
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:23,040
Getting through the

396
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:31,280
Okay, all right,

397
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:39,520
we'll know if

398
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,280
What's with the heavy food?

399
00:17:43,940 --> 00:17:45,400
Slow down.

400
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:53,240
Everyone, you've worked hard this semester.

401
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:58,780
Now, you can enjoy your winter vacation.

402
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,440
Thank you!

403
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,280
However, I want to emphasize again

404
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,660
that the winter vacation of Class 2 is very special.

405
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:13,740
You must complete your homework carefully.

406
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,160
After the semester starts,

407
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,340
all the teachers will check your homework.

408
00:18:19,340 --> 00:18:23,420
Everyone is the key checker.

409
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:24,420
Got it?

410
00:18:25,540 --> 00:18:26,740
No need.

411
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:31,820
Make a reasonable arrangement for your homework and review time.

412
00:18:31,820 --> 00:18:32,820
Okay?

413
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,080
Okay.

414
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:35,080
Okay.

415
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,080
How can I complete so many homework?

416
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:42,040
You should write your own homework.

417
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:45,040
It's not easy to have a vacation.

418
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,040
Can you let me have a rest?

419
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:56,040
Fang Jia, which page are you on?

420
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
I'm writing a movie.

421
00:18:58,040 --> 00:19:00,040
Where's the movie?

422
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:02,040
You finished it first.

423
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,000
Watch a movie.

424
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:09,000
Let me show you.

425
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,000
It's vacation!

426
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
It's been a long time, friends.

427
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,000
Yes, time flies.

428
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
I can't see you again.

429
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,000
I really can't bear to leave.

430
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,000
Let's put fireworks on the New Year's Eve.

431
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Sure.

432
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:29,000
Yang Yang, are you going?

433
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,000
If you want to go, I'll go with you.

434
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,000
Okay.

435
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,000
Okay, I'll go with you.

436
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:36,000
It's New Year's Eve.

437
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,000
I'll call Wenjing.

438
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
Okay.

439
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Dongdong, are you free?

440
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,000
Do you want to have New Year's Eve dinner on New Year's Eve?

441
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
I'm at home with my grandma.

442
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:49,000
I can do it.

443
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,000
I'll listen to the organizers.

444
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Okay, it's settled.

445
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,000
It's vacation!

446
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
It's vacation!

447
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:04,000
Be careful.

448
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
Mom!

449
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:17,000
Mom!

450
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:19,000
Slow down.

451
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:21,000
Your foot is just right.

452
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:23,000
Don't sprain it again.

453
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,000
You must be careful when you play basketball.

454
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,000
That means you can have a good body.

455
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:29,000
That's how you recover faster.

456
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:31,000
You're so shameless.

457
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:33,000
Go and help your dad.

458
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:35,000
By the way, mom,

459
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:37,000
I'll go to watch fireworks tonight.

460
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:39,000
I'll go after dinner.

461
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:41,000
Then be careful tonight.

462
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,000
Yang Yang, are you going with you?

463
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:45,000
We're all going together.

464
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,000
I'm relieved.

465
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Yue, I don't need your help.

466
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:50,000
You can play by yourself.

467
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:51,000
You're so polite to me.

468
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
I'll cut the vegetables for you.

469
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,000
Your foot is just right.

470
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
You just have to wait for it today.

471
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:58,000
I'll do as you say.

472
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,000
Grandma, come out for your dinner.

473
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:18,000
Thank you, dad.

474
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:23,000
Grandma, the New Year is coming.

475
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:25,000
It's getting closer to your senior year.

476
00:21:25,000 --> 00:21:28,000
Don't put your mind on studying in the future.

477
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Do you understand?

478
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
I understand, mom.

479
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
You must study more in the future.

480
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,000
Don't play basketball.

481
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,000
I'll try my best.

482
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:41,000
Mom, I'll go to watch fireworks with my classmates after dinner.

483
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,000
Go ahead.

484
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:47,000
Why do you ask everything?

485
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:49,000
You don't ask me if I agree or not.

486
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:52,000
Family is the master.

487
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:55,000
I want to go out with my classmates during the holiday.

488
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,000
Is that okay?

489
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,000
I'll ask for you on behalf of our Nanen.

490
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:08,000
Be careful when you go out.

491
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:14,000
Thank you, dad.

492
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,000
Eat.

493
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Nanen, be careful when you go out with your dad.

494
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,000
Be careful.

495
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:23,000
Have some soup.

496
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,000
Look.

497
00:23:17,000 --> 00:23:18,000
Look.

498
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Look at that.

499
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:22,560
It's so beautiful.

500
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Yes.

501
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:26,840
Yes, it's so beautiful.

502
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:31,600
I hope we can be as happy as we are now.

503
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:32,960
We will.

504
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,440
I didn't expect that

505
00:23:35,600 --> 00:23:36,680
the first half of the second year of high school

506
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:37,800
would end so soon.

507
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:38,960
Yes.

508
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,560
It feels like we're getting closer to the college entrance examination.

509
00:23:42,280 --> 00:23:44,160
But I'm the only one who can't

510
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:45,560
get out of this mess.

511
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,720
I'm so happy.

512
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,480
But I don't know

513
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:51,080
what kind of college I can get into.

514
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:54,520
Shengnan, you like orchids so much.

515
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,040
Actually, you can consider

516
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,000
getting into a university with a physical education.

517
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,800
A university with a physical education?

518
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:02,160
That's good.

519
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,720
But I don't know if my cultural education is enough.

520
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:07,200
It's okay, Shengnan.

521
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:09,960
I'm here for you.

522
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:11,320
Don't worry.

523
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:12,600
We will help you.

524
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:15,400
We will help you realize your dream of orchid.

525
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:16,560
That's great.

526
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:17,800
Thank you, Yao Yao.

527
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:21,560
We're good friends.

528
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,600
Do you think

529
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,680
we can get into the university we want?

530
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:41,680
Zhou Yue, what are you worried about?

531
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,280
What I mean is

532
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,400
whether we can get into the same university.

533
00:24:46,560 --> 00:24:48,080
After we get into the university,

534
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,520
we have to separate, right?

535
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:54,160
Although you can get into my school,

536
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:57,240
I don't think you'll have any problem with your school.

537
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,920
You're always asking

538
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,480
and giving yourself a hard time.

539
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:05,960
Even if we can't get into the same university,

540
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,480
we can get into the same city.

541
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,600
If we can't get into the same city,

542
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,480
as long as we have each other in our hearts,

543
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:13,800
we will never separate.

544
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:14,600
That's right.

545
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:16,640
As long as we have each other in our hearts,

546
00:25:16,800 --> 00:25:18,320
we will never separate.

547
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:22,400
Get into the same city?

548
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,560
I want to realize my dream of orchid.

549
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:38,080
I want to get into the university I want to be.

550
00:25:39,040 --> 00:25:41,480
We can hold on to our future.

551
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:43,560
Zhao Lin Jiu is right.

552
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:46,880
I'm so happy to meet you.

553
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,600
I want to be myself forever.

554
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,640
I will surpass Wen Zhi Yang.

555
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:03,040
Happy New Year!

556
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:06,400
Happy New Year!

557
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:16,520
Happy New Year!

558
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:28,480
Wow!

559
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:29,440
We won the competition!

560
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:31,320
That's great!

561
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
To the small shop on the street

562
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
Taotao

563
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:20,560
The autumn cicadas are noisy

564
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:23,560
The sun has just turned blue

565
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:27,560
I turned my head and saw your smile

566
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
To the place we agreed on

567
00:27:29,560 --> 00:27:30,560
Quietly

568
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:32,560
The evening breeze is blowing

569
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,560
