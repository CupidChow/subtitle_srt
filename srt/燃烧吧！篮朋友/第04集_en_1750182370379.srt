1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's the point of singing your dream?

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm a flower that blooms in the wind

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let everything be a glory

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the dark night

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How can I forget the cold rain

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It turns out that love is a kind of love

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't be afraid

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen to the sound of your tiger and your shadow

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In the water, I don't want to wake up

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The secret that has become a hat

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Protect me and you

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How can I forget the cold rain

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It turns out that love is a kind of love

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't be afraid

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How can I forget the cold rain

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It turns out that love is a kind of love

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't be afraid

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Listen to the sound of your tiger and your shadow

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
In the water, I don't want to wake up

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The secret that has become a hat

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Protect me and you

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The Secret of Love

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 1

27
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Come on!

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Come on!

29
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
Come on!

30
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's beautiful, right?

31
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Come on!

32
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Come on!

33
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Come on!

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Come on!

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Come on!

36
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Come on!

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Zhou Yue, you still need to eat and eat the rice and the turtle?

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
No, I was doing it to protect me

39
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
You also gave me a talent, you still need to protect others

40
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,000
I'll go to you, it's the same, you win anyway

41
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You just love the old man

42
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Go away

43
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Do you think you are great?

44
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Why can't you see?

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Shengnan, you misunderstood

46
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I didn't misunderstand

47
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
You want to be a support, you can give Zhang Wenjing a chance

48
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Do you think you are good?

49
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Others will think so, others will think it's boring

50
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
If you need to give a chance, what's the point of it?

51
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
What is the spirit of sports?

52
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
It's fair, why do you think you can win?

53
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:45,000
I just want to say that I don't think it's that serious

54
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Zhou Yue doesn't mean that

55
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
It's the same as yesterday

56
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You can win me with your determination

57
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:55,000
You keep on dropping me, I'll give you two points

58
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
I'll give you three points, you'll give me three points

59
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You keep on playing me to the end

60
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
You still won the game

61
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
I don't think it's a real competition

62
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I will think you are insulting me

63
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
I didn't

64
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Shengnan, it's because the next time is too short

65
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I hope everyone can have fun

66
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm just saying

67
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I'm sorry

68
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
I think everyone is right

69
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
You are the same as me, right?

70
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
You are the same as everyone

71
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Yes, there is no one who can see who

72
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Right, who is so mean

73
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I know it, you don't need to go

74
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Step on it

75
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:46,000
Yuyuan, I'll go through the same

76
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay

77
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,160
The other day

78
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,800
I strongly unexplored

79
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,100
that the date has passed

80
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:14,360
I sold it through a nearby shopping iron

81
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,660
to mark it as the date

82
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:19,940
The main clock is about to komma

83
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:20,400
It is?

84
00:05:20,420 --> 00:05:21,300
рублей

85
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:21,880
Battalion!

86
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:25,400
If it's safe,

87
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,740
then okay

88
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:32,960
I can't believe that

89
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:35,960
I've been talking to them for a long time.

90
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,960
I've sent my grandma to them.

91
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:40,960
They're giving me this.

92
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:43,960
Your mom really loves you.

93
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:45,960
Really?

94
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:47,960
Yes.

95
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:50,960
She's been keeping you safe when she's trying to protect you.

96
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:53,960
But she didn't give me anything.

97
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:54,960
Please.

98
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:56,960
How can you care about your children's parents?

99
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,960
Actually, she's been giving me a lot of things.

100
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,960
I'm very upset when she's told me about it.

101
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:02,960
I'm very upset.

102
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,960
I'm very, very cold.

103
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,960
So...

104
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:09,960
So you're really angry.

105
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
I'm just a little bit upset.

106
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:12,960
I forgot.

107
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:15,960
I know you don't care about your children's parents.

108
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,960
You don't even care about them.

109
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,960
But I'm really wrong.

110
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,960
When people are in a relationship,

111
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:25,960
they will not love many people.

112
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:27,960
They will have many good friends.

113
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,960
Because they don't give each other their eyes

114
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:31,960
and have misunderstandings.

115
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:33,960
If this song doesn't solve it,

116
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:35,960
then it will always exist.

117
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,960
Why do you always keep your words so tight?

118
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
That's not true.

119
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:42,960
Let's go to Shennan.

120
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,960
Put on the dirty clothes and get up.

121
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:45,960
No need.

122
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:48,960
Do you think you're great?

123
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,960
Why can't you see people?

124
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,960
Shennan, you misunderstood.

125
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,960
So Shennan, I'm sorry.

126
00:06:57,960 --> 00:06:58,960
I was wrong.

127
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:01,960
It's okay.

128
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,960
I'm not wrong.

129
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:07,960
I have a point.

130
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:10,960
If you think you're wrong,

131
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:13,960
you should go to Lin Shengnan to talk.

132
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,960
Just apologize.

133
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,960
It's not a big deal.

134
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,960
You've seen too much of your feelings.

135
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,960
Just because of this,

136
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:29,960
I didn't expect you to care so much.

137
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,960
Okay, I forgive you.

138
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:36,960
Thank you, Dongdong.

139
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:37,960
Actually,

140
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,960
I'm a little emotional.

141
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:43,960
I care too much about my feelings.

142
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:59,960
Shennan, I'm sorry.

143
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,960
You should have apologized.

144
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,960
You even took a seat with me.

145
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,960
I've thought about it for a long time.

146
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,960
I still decided to apologize to you.

147
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,960
You're right.

148
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,960
I've been too self-conscious all this time.

149
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
You didn't.

150
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:14,960
No, Shennan.

151
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:16,960
I've been thinking about it all this time.

152
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,960
I thought I was thinking about it as a friend.

153
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,960
But I ignored your real thoughts.

154
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:22,960
Like you said,

155
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,960
victory shouldn't be lost.

156
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:27,960
It's because I thought you care about victory.

157
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,960
Shennan, I apologize to you.

158
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,960
I'm too self-conscious.

159
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,960
Are you done talking?

160
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
I'm not pretending.

161
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
Actually, I came to apologize to you.

162
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,960
Originally,

163
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
the person who was good at the basketball court

164
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:43,960
wanted to take me.

165
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:45,960
I should be happy.

166
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,960
But I was too sensitive and heartbroken.

167
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:50,960
I always wanted to prove myself

168
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:51,960
and liked others' praise.

169
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
I was too self-conscious

170
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,960
and took your kindness as a sacrifice.

171
00:08:55,960 --> 00:08:58,960
It's my fault to be against my brother.

172
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:01,960
So I'm sorry for the mistake.

173
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Since we're both wrong,

174
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,960
let's make it a fairytale.

175
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,960
Okay.

176
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
Are you playing the ball?

177
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,960
I won't let you play.

178
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:18,960
You're saying that

179
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,960
because I'm too sad to let you play.

180
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,960
Okay.

181
00:09:56,960 --> 00:09:57,960
Wait.

182
00:09:57,960 --> 00:09:59,960
Have you been living with your grandma?

183
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:00,960
Yes.

184
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:02,960
My parents' work is on the outside.

185
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:05,960
Yao Yao's parents are not around.

186
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
They're not around.

187
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:08,960
They're both so good at grades.

188
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:11,960
My parents are always watching.

189
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:13,960
They're still so bad at grades.

190
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,960
Zhou Yue's parents are also not around.

191
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,960
Zhou Yue's average chance

192
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,960
can also be a good student.

193
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,960
I didn't expect that she's not that good at grades.

194
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:25,960
Zhou Yue, why aren't you talking?

195
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:27,960
Grandma, I'll fry the balls for you.

196
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:30,960
Why don't you eat?

197
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:36,960
Grandma, your dad was wrong last time.

198
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:38,960
He said that if you study hard,

199
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:40,960
you won't interfere with your hobby.

200
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:41,960
So,

201
00:10:41,960 --> 00:10:44,960
can you talk and communicate well in the future?

202
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:47,960
Okay.

203
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:48,960
Eat while it's hot.

204
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:49,960
I have a dish for you.

205
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:18,960
Yesterday,

206
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,960
the big-time competition in the physics exam was held.

207
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:22,960
I couldn't think of it for half a day.

208
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,960
That's right. It's too hard.

209
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,960
Is his house very rich?

210
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:28,960
Isn't it?

211
00:11:28,960 --> 00:11:29,960
Yes.

212
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,960
What are you pretending to be?

213
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:31,960
Let's go and take a look.

214
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:34,960
Wen Zhi Yao,

215
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:36,960
let's go eat together in school.

216
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:47,960
What's the matter?

217
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,960
I said, class president,

218
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,960
let's go eat together in school.

219
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
I don't want to go.

220
00:11:58,960 --> 00:11:59,960
Let's go.

221
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,960
We all like you.

222
00:12:01,960 --> 00:12:02,960
We want to be your best friend.

223
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,960
Yes, let's go together.

224
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:10,960
Okay, then let's go.

225
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,960
See you in school.

226
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:17,960
Yes.

227
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:34,960
Come come come

228
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:35,960
Go!

229
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:36,960
Wait here, Potato.

230
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:51,960
From now on, turn the notebook to the red door page.

231
00:12:51,960 --> 00:13:02,960
The literature and techniques of the red door page are very effective in the overall period.

232
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:07,960
The new year is coming.

233
00:13:07,960 --> 00:13:11,960
The new year is coming.

234
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:15,960
The new year is coming.

235
00:13:15,960 --> 00:13:22,960
Now, I would like to invite a classmate to read this notebook for us.

236
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,960
Sorry, I can't read it.

237
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,960
Lin Song Nan.

238
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:50,960
Please read it.

239
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:55,960
The last time I read it, I didn't know it was the first time I read it.

240
00:13:55,960 --> 00:13:58,960
It's so hard to tell.

241
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:01,960
I can't read it.

242
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:03,960
Let me read it.

243
00:14:03,960 --> 00:14:06,960
The first time I read it, I didn't know it was the first time I read it.

244
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:08,960
I can't read it.

245
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,960
I can't read it.

246
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,960
I can't read it.

247
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,960
This is a new year.

248
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,960
The new year is coming.

249
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:23,640
that's not a non-negotiatory segment what you need to know to understand the explanation

250
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,440
that's not one block

251
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:31,000
Xiao De chemin

252
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:32,080
I got it, Teacher

253
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,440
read again

254
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,320
divide it

255
00:14:42,280 --> 00:14:43,000
divide it

256
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:46,200
and put on the board

257
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:46,880
then

258
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,960
This is pig's color.

259
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:50,960
OK.

260
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:54,960
Then, you put the pig on the shoulder

261
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,960
and pulled out the sword

262
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,960
and made a hole in the tongue.

263
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
The next thing to say is,

264
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:00,960
Mr. Zhang,

265
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:01,960
can you drink some?

266
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:03,960
Say it quickly.

267
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,960
Chen is not afraid of death.

268
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,960
What can you count for this wine?

269
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,960
You're so mean.

270
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
Mr. Zhang,

271
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:21,960
can you please take a look?

272
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,960
Let's put the stool on the ground.

273
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,960
Put the pig's leg on the stool

274
00:15:26,960 --> 00:15:29,960
and take out the sword and cut the juice.

275
00:15:29,960 --> 00:15:30,960
Mr. Zhang,

276
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:32,960
can you drink some?

277
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:33,960
Say it quickly.

278
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,960
I'm not afraid of death.

279
00:15:35,960 --> 00:15:38,960
What can you count for this wine?

280
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:39,960
Very good.

281
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,960
Please sit.

282
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,960
What's wrong?

283
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:45,960
I'm afraid of death.

284
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:47,960
What's wrong?

285
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
You're laughing.

286
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,960
Mr. Zhang.

287
00:15:51,960 --> 00:15:53,960
Say it.

288
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:55,960
Why are you laughing?

289
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,960
None of my business.

290
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:59,960
The students are laughing.

291
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:05,960
A classmate,

292
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,960
if he doesn't have a skill,

293
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,960
he's like a flash.

294
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:12,960
If he doesn't have the sense of balance

295
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,960
and self-control,

296
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:16,960
he'll be like today,

297
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:19,960
and will directly affect my progress in class.

298
00:16:19,960 --> 00:16:23,960
It will affect your grades in the future,

299
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,960
this Friday,

300
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:35,960
we'll have the first month of the high school grade.

301
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,960
Students,

302
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:45,960
no matter how good or bad your grades were,

303
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,960
after the exam,

304
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:50,960
we'll say goodbye to the past.

305
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,960
We'll win a new class.

306
00:16:56,960 --> 00:16:57,960
After the exam,

307
00:16:57,960 --> 00:17:00,960
we'll win the tutor's award.

308
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:02,960
Students,

309
00:17:02,960 --> 00:17:05,960
prepare for the exam.

310
00:17:11,960 --> 00:17:13,960
Why are you laughing?

311
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,960
I'm laughing.

312
00:17:19,960 --> 00:17:21,960
Wenjing,

313
00:17:21,960 --> 00:17:23,960
if I get better at the exam this time,

314
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,960
can you promise me a request?

315
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,960
Why?

316
00:17:26,960 --> 00:17:28,960
Because I'm working very hard these days.

317
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:31,960
I'm the one who's not going to help you with your English.

318
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,960
Or you don't dare to bet?

319
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:36,120
Alright.

320
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:37,520
It's up to you then.

321
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,880
But if you lose now,

322
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:40,120
you have to say yes.

323
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:41,320
Yes.

324
00:17:44,280 --> 00:17:45,280
The someно surrendered,

325
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:46,840
what should I do?

326
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,040
Just my fear.

327
00:17:48,440 --> 00:17:49,280
Don't you have her?

328
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:50,560
Find her at least.

329
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:52,120
That's right.

330
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:53,520
Dongdong,

331
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:54,840
I'll be there.

332
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:57,520
Okay, I got you.

333
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:00,400
Zhang Wei,

334
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:01,720
don't come Wiederich firms out with me.

335
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,560
Right back to the Residence Bureau.

336
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:03,000
Let's go.

337
00:18:03,000 --> 00:18:05,000
Let's go.

338
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
What should we do?

339
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:11,000
Is it because of his parents' anger?

340
00:18:11,000 --> 00:18:14,000
He even went to the service department.

341
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,000
I want a family uniform. What do you want?

342
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
I also want a family uniform.

343
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:29,000
I just want beef balls.

344
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
There are too many family uniforms. I can't afford to waste them.

345
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Class leader, the family uniform is very expensive.

346
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:41,000
And your family's money is not bad.

347
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
You can't afford to waste them.

348
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
I still want beef balls.

349
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:48,000
You can order here.

350
00:18:51,000 --> 00:18:56,000
Class leader, are you and Zhou Yue living in the villa?

351
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:59,000
What does your parents do?

352
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,000
My parents are ordinary people.

353
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,000
Why don't you have money at home?

354
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:10,000
You are so good.

355
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,000
You are beautiful and rich.

356
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,000
The key is that you are so good at managing things.

357
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,000
What do you want to say?

358
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,000
I don't have that much money with Jiajia.

359
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:26,000
This family uniform is indeed expensive.

360
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,000
How about you help us pay for it?

361
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,000
It's cheap Castell awkward hand.

362
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:42,000
So good acting is my best acting today.

363
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:49,000
Thank you, class leader.

I beg you Master,

389
00:21:40,340 --> 00:21:43,980
just get me out of the riddle.

390
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:47,540
You couldn't do that anyway.

391
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:51,280
And you saved me!

392
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:56,700
And you have to pay me with life-sized ruin.

393
00:21:56,700 --> 00:21:58,700
Thank you, master.

394
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:29,060
It's time to graduate.

395
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,940
Who should I call?

396
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:56,940
You're going to be the best at playing the piano and playing the piano.

397
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,940
What's wrong with you?

398
00:23:13,940 --> 00:23:15,940
Yao Yao, I'm going to celebrate my birthday.

399
00:23:15,940 --> 00:23:19,940
You don't even know my birthday.

400
00:23:19,940 --> 00:23:21,940
You're a regular girl like me.

401
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:25,940
I wish you a happy birthday.

402
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:27,940
Thank you.

403
00:23:27,940 --> 00:23:30,940
Do you know that I've got a perfume?

404
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,940
It's a gift from today.

405
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,940
I really want it.

406
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,940
Will you give it to me?

407
00:23:38,940 --> 00:23:40,940
I don't know.

408
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:48,940
Look, I forgot to ask you when is your birthday.

409
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:50,940
Tell me.

410
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:52,940
The summer holiday.

411
00:23:57,940 --> 00:23:59,940
It's just passed by.

412
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,940
It's a pity.

413
00:24:00,940 --> 00:24:03,940
I'll give you a gift for your birthday next year.

414
00:24:03,940 --> 00:24:05,940
Zhi Yao, you're so rich.

415
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,940
You won't agree to this request, right?

416
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,940
Do you have money?

417
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,940
It's none of your business.

418
00:24:09,940 --> 00:24:10,940
Let's go.

419
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:13,940
Yuan, you go back first.

420
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,940
I'll go.

421
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:16,940
I'm going to eat this.

422
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:18,940
I'm going to eat this.

423
00:24:26,940 --> 00:24:27,940
Brother.

424
00:24:28,940 --> 00:24:30,940
Lin Sheng Lan, it's you again.

425
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:31,940
I'm sorry, teacher.

426
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:33,940
Let's listen to the song later.

427
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:34,940
Okay.

428
00:24:36,940 --> 00:24:37,940
What's this?

429
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:38,940
A big song.

430
00:24:40,940 --> 00:24:41,940
What's that?

431
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:44,940
What's that?

432
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:45,940
It's none of your business.

433
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,940
Tell me.

434
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:47,940
Tell me.

435
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:50,940
Come on.

436
00:25:05,940 --> 00:25:08,940
Zhou Yue, I'll take Yao Yao back today.

437
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:11,940
You go first.

438
00:25:11,940 --> 00:25:12,940
I'll take her back.

439
00:25:13,940 --> 00:25:14,940
I'll leave her to you.

440
00:25:14,940 --> 00:25:16,940
Okay, don't worry.

441
00:25:17,940 --> 00:25:18,940
Bye.

442
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:19,940
Bye.

443
00:25:19,940 --> 00:25:20,940
Yao Yao.

444
00:25:21,940 --> 00:25:22,940
Dong Dong,

445
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
have dinner with me tonight.

446
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:25,940
I don't have anyone at home.

447
00:25:29,940 --> 00:25:30,940
I'll treat you.

448
00:25:30,940 --> 00:25:31,940
Let's go.

449
00:25:31,940 --> 00:25:32,940
Okay.

450
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:34,940
I'm so lucky that my boyfriend isn't home today.

451
00:25:34,940 --> 00:25:35,940
I'll go home.

452
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,940
Thank you.

453
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:47,940
I'll wash the clothes and return it to you.

454
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,940
No need to wash them.

455
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,940
As long as you don't mind,

456
00:25:50,940 --> 00:25:52,940
I'll wash the clothes and the clothes.

457
00:25:54,940 --> 00:25:55,940
By the way, Yao Yao,

458
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,940
I want to ask you a question.

459
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,940
For example,

460
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,940
I'm going to give you a pen.

461
00:26:02,940 --> 00:26:06,940
What if you get angry with Zhou Yue?

462
00:26:08,940 --> 00:26:09,940
He said you got angry?

463
00:26:09,940 --> 00:26:11,940
No, I just asked him casually.

464
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:15,940
Zhou Yue is a good person.

465
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:18,940
He rarely puts things in his heart.

466
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,940
So, no matter what happens,

467
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,940
you don't have to care about it.

468
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,940
Zhou Yue is very generous.

469
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,940
But I can't hurt him

470
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:29,940
because of his generosity.

471
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:31,940
I cherish his friendship with Zhou Yue.

472
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:33,940
So...

473
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:36,940
Xiu Nan,

474
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:39,940
actually, from today on,

475
00:26:39,940 --> 00:26:42,940
I don't know what friends are.

476
00:26:42,940 --> 00:26:44,940
What are the rules?

477
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,940
What should friends do

478
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:48,940
between the rules?

479
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:50,940
What should I do?

480
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,940
I'm not sure.

481
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,940
Let's hang out together,

482
00:26:55,940 --> 00:26:56,940
eat together,

483
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,940
or play football together?

484
00:27:02,940 --> 00:27:03,940
I'm not sure.

485
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:33,940
I'm not sure.

486
00:28:32,940 --> 00:28:34,940
My dear friends,

487
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:36,940
let's be friends forever.

let's be the strongest enemies,

00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:50,940
let's be the most beautiful dreams.

495
00:28:51,940 --> 00:28:53,940
My dear friends,

496
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,940
let's be friends forever.

497
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:57,940
Let's face each other,

498
00:28:57,940 --> 00:28:59,940
let's dream together.

499
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,940
My dear friends,

500
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:03,940
let's fight together,

501
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,940
let's be the strongest enemies,

502
00:29:05,940 --> 00:29:08,940
let's be the best friends forever.
