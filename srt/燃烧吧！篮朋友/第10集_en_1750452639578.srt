1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's the point of singing your dream?

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm a flower that blooms in the wind

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let everything be a glory

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
It's not afraid of the dark night

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How to forget the cold rain

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It turns out to be a kind of encounter

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't be afraid

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen to the sound of your tiger and your shadow

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't be afraid of the stars in the water

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:27,980
The

12
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,000
weather is getting cold

13
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

14
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,000
How to forget the cold rain

15
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:41,000
It turns out to be a kind of encounter

16
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
Don't be afraid

17
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Listen to the sound of your tiger and your shadow

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Don't be afraid of the stars in the water

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,000
The brave man becomes a secret

20
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Take care of us

21
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Leading fan to the bana

22
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,000
spoiler

23
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,000
4th episode

24
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,700
It's a relief to memorize the lyrics

25
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,000
The wind constant like a hopes

26
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:16,040
I spent five percent of total Year's fees.

27
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,240
And thank God you two published another possible report.

28
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:22,720
I remember...

29
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:24,520
three times,

30
00:02:24,520 --> 00:02:26,240
ten times,

31
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,440
earlöki.

32
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:29,680
What is没事 now?

33
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:31,320
Em,

34
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,920
temperature!

35
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,560
Even if the amount is less than in the appreciationicus,

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,520
you'll let the results go a little higher.

37
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:38,640
The lack of relegation is not deep.

38
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,240
Instead,

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,600
only one person will respect three,

40
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:43,520
She is crazy.

41
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:45,760
Is it possible?

42
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,800
It is just correct.

43
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,240
In my opinion,

44
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,960
it's not clear

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:03:05,840
what FormalFilings is,

46
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,800
which can't keep on the exam until next time.

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,800
Why is it so hard to say?

48
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,800
Actually, you're not completely beautiful.

49
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,800
Look, this is the last item in the box.

50
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:39,800
I guarantee that the person who made it is not more than 20%.

51
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,800
You actually did it, right?

52
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,800
Actually, the gift is a dream.

53
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,800
I just talked to you.

54
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:54,800
You really didn't save me.

55
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:57,800
No, luck is also part of strength, okay?

56
00:03:57,800 --> 00:04:00,800
Besides, if you have the ability to be my colleague,

57
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,800
you can give me a supplementary lesson.

58
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:04,800
I can come up here in a minute.

59
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,800
I can't teach you.

60
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:10,800
Actually,

61
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:13,800
there are many people who are willing to teach me.

62
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:15,800
Yao Yao is one of them.

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:20,800
But I think Li Zong, you said that no one dares to say second.

64
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:24,800
Why are you so weak?

65
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,800
Since you're not free, I'll go to the second class to find Yao Yao.

66
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,800
She's very willing to teach me.

67
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:30,800
No.

68
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:38,800
How about this?

69
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,800
From now on, you can leave your gift to me.

70
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:44,800
I'll leave it to you for another hour every day.

71
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:45,800
I won't be able to teach you.

72
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:46,800
Just one hour?

73
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:47,800
Is that enough?

74
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,800
Okay.

75
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:50,800
It's all secret.

76
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,800
I know I'm wrong.

77
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,800
Let me change it.

78
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,800
Take a picture.

79
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:19,800
May I ask how you feel about me?

80
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:21,800
I don't like it.

81
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:26,800
shameless

82
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Twisted Fate

83
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,800
Xiao Nan

84
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,600
OK, see you next time.

85
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:38,920
Shall we go home together?

86
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:41,600
No, Yaoyao. You guys go back first.

87
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,400
I have to take the class with Dongdong later.

88
00:05:45,640 --> 00:05:48,320
Dongdong helps you to take the class?

89
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,800
You guys go back first. Don't wait for me.

90
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,800
I'll wait for you.

91
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:05,400
Look at the paper.

92
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:09,920
It turns out that Shengnan has been not taking classes for the past two days.

93
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:12,840
I didn't expect that she would be so popular this time.

94
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:15,200
Can't you give Shengnan a class?

95
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:17,400
You think I don't want to?

96
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,160
Forget it.

97
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:22,200
You and Dongdong are the same.

98
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:25,960
Only I can't do anything except playing football.

99
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:28,560
Actually, besides taking classes at school,

100
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,040
you two have the most time to get along.

101
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,400
You usually have a training session.

102
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:35,920
How about this?

103
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:37,680
I'll help you take the class.

104
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,800
If your grades are higher,

105
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:42,600
you can naturally help Shengnan take the class.

106
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:46,440
This way, you usually play football and get tired of learning to play.

107
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:48,360
Isn't that great, Yi Jian?

108
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:49,800
Yi Jian, when you think about it,

109
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,160
don't you think that it's just a simple task?

110
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:53,560
I've already prepared a lot.

111
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:55,960
It seems that everything is resolved then.

112
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:58,360
Then, give a word of agreement.

113
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,360
Today's homework is not bad.

114
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:22,360
Then can I...

115
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,360
No.

116
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,360
I just want to leave.

117
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,360
If you want to improve your grades,

118
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:30,360
you should have a little bit of experience.

119
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,360
Do this.

120
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,360
Really?

121
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,360
You're at the level of your grades now.

122
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,360
If you want to make your grades,

123
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,360
the fastest way is to draw a question.

124
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,360
Where did you get this?

125
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,360
So many test papers.

126
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:43,360
I have some test papers.

127
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,360
Don't worry.

128
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,360
Don't worry.

129
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,360
Wait.

130
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,360
You're my ghost.

131
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:52,360
You can do it.

132
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:53,360
You can leave now.

133
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:55,360
If you're not afraid of the next test,

134
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,360
don't be afraid of the family.

135
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,360
Xueyan.

136
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,360
I'll do this.

137
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,360
You'll do this three times later.

138
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,360
Let's put this in.

139
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:36,360
And calculate the result.

140
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
Why haven't you left yet?

141
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:40,360
I'll calculate this.

142
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:47,360
You're done with the test papers.

143
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,360
Why are you

144
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,360
more serious than before?

145
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,360
I just passed the entrance.

146
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:53,360
I saw Brother Nan and Dongdong

147
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:54,360
writing on their own.

148
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
They're all done.

149
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,360
What are you doing?

150
00:08:57,360 --> 00:08:58,360
You're in the national competition?

151
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Why are you so strict?

152
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,360
Xiao Zhan, you're separated?

153
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:09,360
Can't you work hard and get the money?

154
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,360
You and Brother Nan need to work hard.

155
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,360
It's not necessary for people to move and work together.

156
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,360
Hao Wen, your mother asked you to go home and eat.

157
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:28,360
Okay, okay.

158
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:29,360
I'll be home later.

159
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,360
You guys go home and say it carefully.

160
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:44,360
I asked Uncle to buy some food for you.

161
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:46,360
What's that bet?

162
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:54,360
You're the class leader.

163
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:59,360
Are you going to share it with Zhou Yue?

164
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,360
You already sure?

165
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:04,360
Why be so anxious?

166
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:08,360
You're also going to ask class leader to let you know

167
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,360
about Zhou Yue?

168
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,680
Lan Jiu is good at playing.

169
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:13,280
If you don't do well in the department,

170
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,960
how can you be so bad?

171
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,640
Let me warn you.

172
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,840
Don't talk nonsense.

173
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,680
A Yu and his team leader are neighbors.

174
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,080
They are just brothers and sisters.

175
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,160
Brothers and sisters?

176
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:28,760
This is my brother.

177
00:10:28,760 --> 00:10:29,960
This is my sister.

178
00:10:29,960 --> 00:10:31,200
Brothers and sisters.

179
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,200
This is your sister.

180
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,200
Let's have a look.

181
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,520
Who is your name?

182
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:37,360
Get out.

183
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:42,080
Young Master.

184
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:43,720
Yes.

185
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,080
Because

186
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:52,240
we are a close between the two of them together,

187
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,080
I wish you to...

188
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,840
I'll throw this at you?

189
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:57,280
Got it?

190
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:58,680
Got it.

191
00:10:59,200 --> 00:10:59,560
OK.

192
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:02,200
idel.

193
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,840
Come back.

194
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,960
All here.

195
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:04,840
Son of a...

196
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:06,840
Don't make this so earlier.

197
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:08,400
As for your present position,

198
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,760
it's easier to decide.

199
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,360
I'm going home.

200
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,360
Be happy.

201
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,360
Take this home.

202
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,360
Isn't that Zhou Yuehe and Yao Yao?

203
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:34,360
She's not bad.

204
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:43,360
So serious?

205
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,360
I feel like they're both very efficient.

206
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:49,360
They're so good at reading the textbook.

207
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,360
Have you ever been beaten by your mother or your brother?

208
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,360
Why don't you say Yao Yao is better than you?

209
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,360
No.

210
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,360
We have to get used to it.

211
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,360
We'll have to get used to it next time.

212
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:05,360
I'll make a decision for you.

213
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,360
I want it.

214
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,360
Yao Yao.

215
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:25,360
What are you doing?

216
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,360
Wake up.

217
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,360
What are you waiting for?

218
00:12:34,360 --> 00:12:35,360
What are you waiting for?

219
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:36,360
What are you waiting for?

220
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:37,360
I didn't.

221
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,360
I didn't either.

222
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,360
You're not enough.

223
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:46,360
You're not enough to go home.

224
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,360
I'm fine.

225
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,360
I like to eat broccoli.

226
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,360
I'll eat spicy food.

227
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,360
I...

228
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,360
What's on my face?

229
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:19,360
Eat more.

230
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:20,360
Eat more.

231
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,360
Why are you...

232
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:22,360
Why are you acting weird today?

233
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,360
I didn't fart.

234
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,360
You didn't fart?

235
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,360
How's your recent student life?

236
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:31,360
You must be tired.

237
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,360
It's very good for your recent student life.

238
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,360
I think she may be in a month's time to catch up.

239
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,360
You two are so close.

240
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:41,360
I'm very confident in you.

241
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,360
How is it?

242
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,360
Do you want to read?

243
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:49,360
Yao Yao.

244
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:52,360
Do you two have anything to announce with us?

245
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,360
Why do you say that?

246
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:58,360
Forget it.

247
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,360
I'll just say it.

248
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,360
Yesterday, I saw you and Chou Yue

249
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:04,360
having a class at my school.

250
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
Yes.

251
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,360
I've been helping her to get a class these days.

252
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:10,360
I just...

253
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,360
I just want to say

254
00:14:12,360 --> 00:14:15,360
that I saw you two...

255
00:14:16,360 --> 00:14:18,360
You two are still the same.

256
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:20,360
What are you talking about?

257
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,360
You two have been together since childhood.

258
00:14:30,360 --> 00:14:31,360
Let's go.

259
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,360
Yao Yao.

260
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,360
Why are they still in a hurry?

261
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,360
Did we do something wrong to them?

262
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,360
After all, they've been in a good relationship.

263
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,360
How about I go ask them?

264
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,360
I'll go find them and tell them.

265
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,360
Yao Yao.

266
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,360
I'm sorry.

267
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:05,360
Chou Yue.

268
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:06,360
I'm sorry.

269
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:08,360
I was too quick to say it.

270
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,360
What are you talking about?

271
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,360
Don't say it if you don't know it.

272
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:17,360
But Dong Dong just told me...

273
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:18,360
Dong Dong said it.

274
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,360
Dong Dong said it.

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:20,360
Dong Dong said everything.

276
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,360
Don't you have any of your own judgment?

277
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,360
Can you not make any mistakes?

278
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:25,360
Chou Yue, I...

279
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,360
Sheng Nan.

280
00:15:28,360 --> 00:15:30,360
We are so close friends.

281
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:31,360
No.

282
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:33,360
Do you know that you're so confused?

283
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:35,360
You're making me feel awkward with Chou Yue.

284
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:38,360
Think about it.

285
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,360
Yao Yao.

286
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,360
Yao Yao, I...

287
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:57,360
väldigt bien.

288
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,360
Jiang Du.

289
00:16:22,360 --> 00:16:23,360
I...

290
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:26,680
They are all angry.

291
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,280
Let's go to class.

292
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,240
Xiaoyang.

293
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,760
How's the tea we went to the class next time?

294
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:54,960
The milk tea is really good.

295
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:55,680
Yes.

296
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:57,000
We have a lot of classmates.

297
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:00,480
Why haven't you come yet?

298
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:01,280
It's so quiet.

299
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:04,440
Xiuyue.

300
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:05,400
Let's go.

301
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,280
Why?

302
00:17:27,320 --> 00:17:28,560
It's been three days.

303
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:30,680
They saw me and don't know me.

304
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:33,280
We have become the most familiar strangers

305
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,320
in the world.

306
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,120
It seems that the problem is very serious this time.

307
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:39,840
But it's okay.

308
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,840
There is a golden mark in the book.

309
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
I think you should

310
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:47,760
find a solution in the book.

311
00:17:48,280 --> 00:17:50,400
Let's see how to

312
00:17:50,400 --> 00:17:51,680
maintain a sense of love

313
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:52,960
for a mature person.

314
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:54,920
You are still here?

315
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:55,840
Yes.

316
00:17:58,040 --> 00:17:59,040
Fiyi.

317
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,560
Fyi.

318
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,080
Keep it on.

319
00:18:15,320 --> 00:18:16,760
You are pretty good.

320
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,560
Don't mushy damle

321
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,480
Hey, when you were learns

322
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,220
Why are you out now?

323
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:38,360
mom

324
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,820
I do something to ask you

325
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:43,560
what's up

326
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,060
ask

327
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,160
you and my dad

328
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:51,660
The three is a old fight

329
00:18:52,560 --> 00:18:52,960
yeah

330
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,560
Are you afraid I will divorce your dad?

331
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,560
Don't worry, dad.

332
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,560
Your dad is just a knife and a knife.

333
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,560
He is not interested in it.

334
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:04,360
If you really divorce him,

335
00:19:04,760 --> 00:19:05,960
he will be so unhappy.

336
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,360
Besides,

337
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:08,760
he is always angry.

338
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:09,760
He can give you a lot of love

339
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:11,160
when he is at a low price.

340
00:19:11,960 --> 00:19:13,160
No, mom.

341
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:14,560
I just want to ask you,

342
00:19:14,560 --> 00:19:16,560
after you quarreled with my dad,

343
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:18,760
you didn't talk to each other

344
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,360
or talk to each other.

345
00:19:20,760 --> 00:19:22,360
How did you get along?

346
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:23,760
How?

347
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:25,360
Just be a good boy.

348
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:26,960
That's good.

349
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:27,960
Then,

350
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,560
it's all my dad's fault.

351
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:31,160
Of course.

352
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,160
Don't think that your dad is a fool.

353
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,560
He is always angry.

354
00:19:34,760 --> 00:19:35,560
Every time,

355
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:37,160
he is the one who is the most upset.

356
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:39,360
I don't want to divorce him.

357
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,360
If he can't divorce me,

358
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:43,560
I will divorce him forever.

359
00:19:45,760 --> 00:19:46,560
Then,

360
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:48,160
how did you get along?

361
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:48,760
Mom,

362
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,360
tell me.

363
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:53,360
How did you get along?

364
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,160
I think about it.

365
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:58,760
You said,

366
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,560
your dad is young.

367
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:03,560
We just had a relationship.

368
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:05,560
Either,

369
00:20:05,560 --> 00:20:06,760
buy me a small gift,

370
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:08,360
or,

371
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,560
write me a small note.

372
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,560
Otherwise,

373
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,560
I will go to the movies.

374
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:19,360
Now,

375
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:20,560
he is old,

376
00:20:20,560 --> 00:20:21,760
his heart is also growing.

377
00:20:21,960 --> 00:20:23,360
He will buy some fruits,

378
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:24,360
buy some vegetables,

379
00:20:24,360 --> 00:20:25,360
and come back to fool me.

380
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:29,960
You are not angry with the medicine?

381
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:31,560
Why should I be angry?

382
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:32,960
Think about it.

383
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,560
We have been in love for a while,

384
00:20:34,760 --> 00:20:35,960
and we don't have a phone.

385
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:37,560
It's not convenient now.

386
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:39,360
If we can't see each other,

387
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,360
we should write a letter.

388
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,560
The most important thing is,

389
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,760
your dad is heartless.

390
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,960
I will go to the movies.

391
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:55,960
I will go to the movies.

392
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:56,960
I will go to the movies.

393
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:57,960
I will go to the movies.

394
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:58,960
I will go to the movies.

395
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,960
I will go to the movies.

396
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,960
I will go to the movies.

397
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:01,960
I will go to the movies.

398
00:21:01,960 --> 00:21:02,960
I will go to the movies.

399
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:03,960
I will go to the movies.

400
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
I will go to the movies.

401
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:05,960
I will go to the movies.

402
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:06,960
I will go to the movies.

403
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:07,960
I will go to the movies.

404
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:08,960
I will go to the movies.

405
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:09,960
I will go to the movies.

406
00:21:09,960 --> 00:21:10,960
I will go to the movies.

407
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:11,960
I will go to the movies.

408
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,960
I will go to the movies.

409
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:13,960
I will go to the movies.

410
00:21:13,960 --> 00:21:14,960
I will go to the movies.

411
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
I will go to the movies.

412
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,960
I will go to the movies.

413
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:17,960
I will go to the movies.

414
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,560
Then there will always be women.

415
00:21:19,560 --> 00:21:20,560
There will always be men.

416
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:21,960
There will always be women.

417
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,760
Men are men

418
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:46,760
people are δق756

419
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,160
Which man gave it to you again?

420
00:21:53,080 --> 00:21:54,920
Squad leader, I'll help you throw it away.

421
00:21:55,680 --> 00:21:56,360
No.

422
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:58,680
Shengnan gave it to me.

423
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,880
Shengnan gave it to you?

424
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,840
It's so hard to give it to you.

425
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:05,360
I almost misunderstood her.

426
00:22:11,680 --> 00:22:12,840
She's kind of thoughtful.

427
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,160
She even did a little thing.

428
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:15,800
I didn't expect

429
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,240
Shengnan's hand is so strong.

430
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:20,440
Or

431
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,600
you can have some sweet food

432
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:23,600
and be happy.

433
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:26,000
You're quite popular.

434
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,720
I'll help you.

435
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:52,640
ut

436
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,760
Which█r

437
00:23:06,420 --> 00:23:06,920
Which█r

438
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:07,540
is the, bucket bag?

439
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:09,120
Why are you waiting?

440
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:09,840
Am I crazy now?

441
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,920
Come on, you spy what boundary.

442
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:12,560
Yeah, yeah.

443
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,340
So I don't understand you.

444
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,780
Strawberry

445
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,260
Mine

446
00:23:19,780 --> 00:23:21,720
Lime

447
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,840
Strawberry

448
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:38,140
Yo, yo

449
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,800
you still can't forgive me

450
00:23:44,340 --> 00:23:45,340
I'll give it to you.

451
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:53,340
It's so popular.

452
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,340
None of your business.

453
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,340
Then your strawberry is quite big.

454
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:00,340
Hold it.

455
00:24:00,340 --> 00:24:01,340
Let go of me.

456
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:04,340
So weird.

457
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,340
You and Zhou Yue are good now.

458
00:24:09,340 --> 00:24:10,340
No.

459
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,340
I forgot it.

460
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:16,340
I'll give it to you.

461
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:45,340
I'll give it to you.

462
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,340
My friend.

463
00:25:44,340 --> 00:25:45,340
My friend.

464
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,340
The End
