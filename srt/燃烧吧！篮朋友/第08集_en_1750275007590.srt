00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How to sing your dream

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I will draw the sky with the wind

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let everything be the glory

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In the dark night, I'm not afraid

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Listen, that's your favorite voice

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How to forget the memories

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It turns out love is a kind of encounter

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't be afraid

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen, that's the voice that calls for you

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
In the water, I'm not afraid of waking up

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
I'm secretly hiding my secret

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Protect me and you

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Listen, that's your favorite voice

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How to forget the memories

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It turns out love is a kind of encounter

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't be afraid

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Listen, that's the voice that calls for you

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How to forget the memories

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It turns out love is a kind of encounter

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't be afraid

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Listen, that's the voice that calls for you

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
In the water, I'm not afraid of waking up

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
I'm secretly hiding my secret

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Protect me and you

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Episode 1

26
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Didn't you tell me that he loves spicy food?

27
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
He only eats spicy food after a meal?

28
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
I think he has a smell of spicy food.

29
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,000
I'm not good at cooking.

30
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Then I'm not bad at cooking.

31
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Big brother.

32
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Then you can't give a whole box of chili sauce.

33
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
You want him to eat with chili sauce.

34
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
He doesn't like it.

35
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
You're so mean.

36
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Did he know that I gave it to him?

37
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,000
I don't know.

38
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
That's good.

39
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:37,000
Forget it, brother.

40
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I know Liao Liao very well.

41
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He is not interested in love at all.

42
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I know.

43
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Then you still give it to me.

44
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
There will be no result if you continue to give it.

45
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
I know what you mean.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Isn't this the first time I like someone?

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
I'm not good at it.

48
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Brother, have you ever thought that

49
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
sometimes you think it's good for him

50
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
and just want to ask for it?

51
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:06,000
Okay, brother.

52
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I understand what you mean.

53
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I know he is a stranger.

54
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
I just give him the snacks.

55
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
It's not a tradition.

56
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,000
You two are both my friends.

57
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
I don't want him to be troubled.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I don't want you to get hurt.

59
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
I'm fine.

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Don't worry about me.

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I'll be back.

62
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Don't be so rude.

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Okay.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Students.

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,000
This spring sports meeting

66
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:40,000
is the most important thing for us to study.

67
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
We have to be patient.

68
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Students who are capable of doing good things,

69
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,000
we have to work hard to improve our grades.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
So that all of our students can feel

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
the spirit of our grades.

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You know?

73
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I know.

74
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Okay.

75
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
This is it.

76
00:03:55,000 --> 00:04:00,780
The

77
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
time for the spring sports meeting is coming.

78
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
We have to work hard.

79
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
We have to work hard.

80
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
We have to work hard.

81
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I know.

82
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
I'll be back.

83
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Okay, Mr. Yan.

84
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
Go for it.

85
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Go for it.

86
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
Go for it.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Class director.

88
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Let me sign it.

89
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,000
I'm going to sign it.

90
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,000
100 meters and 40 meters.

91
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I got it.

92
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Good job, Zhang Wei.

93
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,000
No.

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
Which one?

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
480.

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:36,000
411.

97
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Okay.

98
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'll help you.

99
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Look.

100
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Jump far.

101
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Then, a 400-meter jump.

102
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And a female.

103
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
4x100.

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Okay.

105
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
I got it.

106
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Then, a nose.

107
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,000
Yao Yao.

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
How's the exercise?

109
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Two more.

110
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Two more?

111
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Which two?

112
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:04,000
A female.

113
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
1500 meters away.

114
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,000
And a male.

115
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
4x100.

116
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
That's not a big problem.

117
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I used to run this time.

118
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
But running short and running fast.

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:18,000
And 1500 meters are in the same day.

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
If you all three of you participate,

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I think you can't eat.

122
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
It's okay.

123
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I can run very well.

124
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Don't you remember?

125
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
I run every week for training.

126
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I run nearly 10 kilometers.

127
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,000
I run with Ma La Song 4.

128
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,000
So I'm very patient.

129
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Don't worry.

130
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Actually, I think that

131
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,000
I haven't participated in the exercise.

132
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,000
I came here myself.

133
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,000
Yao Yao.

134
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Are you sure?

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
But I want to try.

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I didn't expect that you are brave

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
when you look at Wen Wen Jing Jing.

138
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Then, who do you think is less than 4x100?

139
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
Zhou Yue.

140
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Zhang Wei.

141
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Or Zhang Wen Jing?

142
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
No.

143
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,000
They have all three different poses.

144
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I really don't know who I'm looking for.

145
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
So,

146
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
you are a father and a son-in-law.

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Can you do it?

148
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I'll practice more.

149
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
It's okay.

150
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You can try now.

151
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Try it.

152
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
How can you participate in the exercise?

153
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I think you can.

154
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,000
Why do you run 400 meters?

155
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
How can you help me?

156
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Because we all participated.

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,000
If you participate,

158
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
we will go to training together.

159
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Don't you always make the decision?

160
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
I don't want you to be the boss.

161
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,000
You know I'm the boss.

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
You think it's good to go to training together.

163
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
You think it's good.

164
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
How can you ask me

165
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
my feelings?

166
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Ask me if you want to.

167
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I thought you want to be with us.

168
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:19,000
No.

169
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I don't want to.

170
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
I don't want to be

171
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
on the other side of the world

172
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,000
except for the time.

173
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,000
So, I can ask you to be a little more comfortable.

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Can I be alone?

175
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,000
You...

176
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
Sorry.

177
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
You ask me to

178
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
help him with money.

179
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
Forget it.

180
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
You're afraid

181
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
you'll be embarrassed

182
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
at the exercise.

183
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I'm not good at sports.

184
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
But I'm famous.

185
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
Look at this.

186
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
The student friend of the four seasons.

187
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
The three Chinese Bridge Middle School

188
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
is the best middle school in the three regions.

189
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,000
The student's survival rate

190
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
reached 90.3%.

191
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Although you and I

192
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
are not only the same,

193
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
Mr. Yan said

194
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
the three good students

195
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
should be educated and educated.

196
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
The sports are the weak points of our common sense.

197
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
If anyone among us

198
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
missed this chance

199
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
because of sports,

200
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
is it a pity?

201
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,000
If you have to choose

202
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,000
the third and the third grade students,

203
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you can't have such a short version.

204
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
That's right.

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So this time's sports

206
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
is a chance

207
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,000
to prove your chance.

208
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If you usually train,

209
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:09,000
you'll be able to

210
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:11,000
help Zhou Yue and Shengnan.

211
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,000
If you can win a prize,

212
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
that's the best.

213
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Although it's a good idea,

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
I'm really the one

215
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
who made the main chapter for you.

216
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Since I violated your will,

217
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
and hurt your friendship with Shengnan,

218
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'll go to Mr. Yan

219
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
to propose to you

220
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
and cancel your chance.

221
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
Wait.

222
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Actually, you're right.

223
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
We have two grades.

224
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
If we get stuck in sports,

225
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,000
it's a pity.

226
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
So,

227
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
are you willing to join

228
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
this sports meeting?

229
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Of course.

230
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't hurry.

231
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
Get up.

232
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Just go straight like this.

233
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,120
Brave guy

234
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:23,360
is wearing exorcism.

235
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:24,560
I asked him to

236
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:26,480
sleep far away and do nothing.

237
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:27,640
Then he will go away.

238
00:10:28,080 --> 00:10:29,520
Exactly,

239
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,040
let him rest assured.

240
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:33,980
Why should I

241
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,580
expose him?

242
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,160
It's because

243
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,360
you care for him?

244
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,160
I don't mind him.

245
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,640
How is that possible?

246
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:44,840
It's my festival.

247
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:46,520
Dongdong,

248
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,480
why are you in a hurry?

249
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,480
You don't understand us.

250
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,480
I just don't want to see you.

251
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:58,480
Hongdong, it's good that you're here.

252
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:00,480
Let's start the training.

253
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:22,480
Sun, just turn around and shake.

254
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:25,480
I have a head, I see your smile.

255
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,480
The better place, the more I look.

256
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,480
The wind is blowing, the wind is falling.

257
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:36,480
Let's feel this love for a moment.

258
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:39,480
Let's hold hands and smile.

259
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:41,480
We are like a dream.

260
00:11:41,480 --> 00:11:44,480
Let's start our training together.

261
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:46,480
You are my friend.

262
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,480
I respect all the students,

263
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,480
teachers and classmates who are from the same school.

264
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,480
Next is the training meeting of our three Chinese school students.

265
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,480
The health and clothes are perfect.

266
00:11:56,480 --> 00:11:59,480
The competition is more important than everyone's work and learning.

267
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:02,480
The top student has already won the second優良 tradition of the competition.

268
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:04,480
It's not like the top student is the top student.

269
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,480
The competition is not like the top student.

270
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,480
Shengnan, why are you here?

271
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:13,480
You should go to the field.

272
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:15,480
Don't worry, I'll come over and take a look.

273
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,480
You are a little shy.

274
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:19,480
Don't worry, Shengnan.

275
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,480
Dongdong is fine.

276
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,480
It's all my fault, I have to report to you.

277
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:26,480
You didn't like running, but now you are fine.

278
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,480
You are hurt.

279
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:30,480
You are so stupid.

280
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,480
Don't worry, I will take the prize and leave it to me.

281
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:36,480
So, take care of Dongdong.

282
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,480
Take care, don't get hurt.

283
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,480
Okay, I got it.

284
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,480
I have a dream.

285
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,480
It's the Ma Ding Lu De Jing

286
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,480
on August 28, 1963.

287
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:06,480
In the famous performance of the French champion,

288
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:09,480
Lin Kenji Ninh-Tang.

289
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
Lin Songnan.

290
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,480
What?

291
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:17,480
Lin Songnan.

292
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,480
Teacher.

293
00:13:21,480 --> 00:13:23,480
The training meeting is going to be held in the city.

294
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:25,480
The training meeting is over.

295
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,480
You love sports,

296
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:30,480
and you are always praised by the audience.

297
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,480
But it's not like you have a face-to-face experience.

298
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,480
Teacher, I know.

299
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:36,480
You are so good at listening to the lesson.

300
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,480
How many times have you said that?

301
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,480
Sit down.

302
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:49,480
Students,

303
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,480
the semester is about to end.

304
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,480
In the next lesson,

305
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,480
I hope you can listen to the lesson

306
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,480
with your heart.

307
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:00,480
Okay?

308
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,480
The exam is only

309
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:07,480
a month away.

310
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,480
Everyone, be ready.

311
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:13,480
Are you ready?

312
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,480
Are you ready?

313
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:16,480
Are you ready?

314
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:19,480
Besides,

315
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:21,480
you will face the high-school class soon.

316
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:24,480
The cultural separation will affect

317
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,480
the high-schooling of your Tianpo University.

318
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,480
Do you know that?

319
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Before the semester ends,

320
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,480
I will send the separation letter to you.

321
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,480
I hope you can think about it carefully.

322
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:49,480
Because it will take care of your future.

323
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:08,480
What do you think about the separation letter?

324
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:09,480
What about the current one?

325
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,480
I can choose the cultural one.

326
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,480
I choose Li Ke.

327
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:16,480
What about you?

328
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
I should choose Li Ke.

329
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,480
I can't choose the one with a dead body.

330
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:23,480
I don't know what to choose.

331
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,480
But I don't want to be separated from everyone.

332
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:27,480
My Li Ke is really bad.

333
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:29,480
If it's about the cultural one,

334
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:31,480
I can still be a Buddhist.

335
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,480
If you choose the cultural one,

336
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,480
we will have to split up.

337
00:15:38,480 --> 00:15:39,480
Isn't that so?

338
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,480
I will report to the cultural one.

339
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,480
What?

340
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,480
Really?

341
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:52,480
Isn't the cultural one your ideal?

342
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
I don't want to be separated from the cultural one.

343
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,480
I want to be in the cultural one.

344
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,480
In terms of the cultural one,

345
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,480
Li Ke is a good choice.

346
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,480
Li Ke.

347
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:15,480
The four of us

348
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,480
will be separated soon.

349
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:32,480
Xiaoyang.

350
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,480
I heard that you have made a high-end separation notice.

351
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:37,480
What are you going to do?

352
00:16:39,480 --> 00:16:40,480
I'm going to study.

353
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:42,480
Okay.

354
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,480
Okay.

355
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,480
Your dad and I

356
00:16:45,480 --> 00:16:46,480
were going to

357
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,480
send you out to study

358
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,480
when you go to college.

359
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,480
With your success,

360
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:51,480
you will have a lot of good schools abroad

361
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,480
to choose from.

362
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,480
Since you chose to study,

363
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,480
you will have more time

364
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:56,480
to study in the public.

365
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,480
It means

366
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:04,480
you don't have to go out

367
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,480
to study.

368
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:06,480
The issue of separation is

369
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:08,480
that you don't have to be stressed.

370
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:10,480
Whether it's the choice or the argument,

371
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
your mom and I support you.

372
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,480
That's right.

373
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,480
It's okay to be in the cultural one.

374
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,480
My daughter

375
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:20,480
is the best.

376
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:21,480
Yes.

377
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:23,480
Here.

378
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,480
Drink one.

379
00:17:25,480 --> 00:17:26,480
Thank you.

380
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,480
Zhou,

381
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,480
I'm going to choose Li Ke.

382
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:39,480
You can still choose Li Ke.

383
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
I can.

384
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:43,480
Since you chose Li Ke,

385
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,480
you should study well.

386
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:45,480
The subject of Gao Er

387
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,480
is still very important.

388
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:49,480
You

389
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,480
don't have to be stressed.

390
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,480
You know it.

391
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
Okay, Zhou.

392
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,480
You have to listen to me.

393
00:17:59,480 --> 00:18:00,480
But I...

394
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,480
No, you have to

395
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:02,480
give me a report

396
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,480
about the separation.

397
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:06,480
What's wrong with you two?

398
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,480
He...

399
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,480
I want to report Li Ke.

400
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:09,480
Report Li Ke?

401
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:10,480
It's hard to report Li Ke.

402
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:11,480
You know it.

403
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,480
Men choose Li Ke.

404
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,480
Because men's brains

405
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,480
are more active than women's.

406
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:16,480
If you choose Li Ke,

407
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:17,480
you will have more power.

408
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:18,480
You choose Wen Ke.

409
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,480
You can be relaxed.

410
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,480
You are here again.

411
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:22,480
You think

412
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:23,480
women are better than men.

413
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,480
You...

414
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:26,480
What's your attitude?

415
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,480
Stop that temper.

416
00:18:27,480 --> 00:18:28,480
Nana,

417
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,480
you are stupid.

418
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,480
What he means is that

419
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:32,480
Wen Ke

420
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,480
is simple and simple.

421
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,480
He will be easy to be a high school student.

422
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:36,480
He doesn't mean that.

423
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,480
He just

424
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:38,480
doesn't like me.

425
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,480
He thinks I am not good at learning.

426
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,480
Isn't that true?

427
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Don't you have any

428
00:18:43,480 --> 00:18:44,480
good points in mind?

429
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:45,480
At the end of the day,

430
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:46,480
if you can't

431
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:47,480
enter the three-way school

432
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,480
because of your physical strength,

433
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:51,480
I can only choose Wen Ke

434
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,480
for this matter.

435
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,480
I can't do anything else.

436
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:55,480
It's my own decision.

437
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,480
You are the opposite.

438
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:57,480
Nana.

439
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,480
You decide.

440
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,480
What's your decision?

441
00:18:59,480 --> 00:19:00,480
Nana, Nana.

442
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,480
Nana.

443
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:02,480
Look at this kid.

444
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,480
He is not good at learning.

445
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:05,480
He is a bad temper.

446
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,480
Shut up.

447
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:07,480
Can you talk to him

448
00:19:07,480 --> 00:19:08,480
nicely?

449
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,480
You always

450
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:10,480
talk to him like this.

451
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:11,480
Do you know how to talk?

452
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:12,480
I teach him every time.

453
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,480
Don't be a nurse.

454
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:14,480
Do you know how to talk?

455
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,480
The situation

456
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
is the way you said it.

457
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,480
I think I know you well.

458
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:23,480
And

459
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:24,480
your dad has no problem with it.

460
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,480
You are still laughing.

461
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,480
So you chose Li Ke in the end.

462
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,480
I have said it.

463
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,480
You can't turn back.

464
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:35,480
Since it's like this,

465
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,480
I will choose Li Ke.

466
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,480
Good.

467
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:39,480
Everyone chose Li Ke.

468
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,480
When the time comes,

469
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,480
we will have a new class.

470
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,480
From the concept,

471
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,480
you may be very low-key.

472
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:51,480
You are so cheap.

473
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,480
I am a little bit shy.

474
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:07,480
I am a little bit shy.

475
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:09,480
I am a little bit shy.

476
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:11,480
I am a little bit shy.

477
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:13,480
I am a little bit shy.

478
00:20:13,480 --> 00:20:15,480
I am a little bit shy.

479
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:17,480
I am a little bit shy.

480
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,480
I am a little bit shy.

481
00:20:19,480 --> 00:20:21,480
I am a little bit shy.

482
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,480
I am a little bit shy.

483
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,480
I am a little bit shy.

484
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:27,480
I am a little bit shy.

485
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,480
I am a little bit shy.

486
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:31,480
I am a little bit shy.

487
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:33,480
I am a little bit shy.

488
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,480
I am a little bit shy.

489
00:20:35,480 --> 00:20:36,480
Actually,

490
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,480
I am a little bit shy.

491
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:40,480
I am a little bit shy.

492
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:43,480
Why are you getting the second one?

493
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:45,480
You are so rich.

494
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:49,480
I expected that you should buy it for me.

495
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,480
This class is all about the money.

496
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:53,480
I am ready.

497
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,480
Start over with your brother and me.

498
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,480
Finally spare your life.

499
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:59,480
I was a little disappointing.

500
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:00,520
It's hard to be a customer.

501
00:21:00,520 --> 00:21:01,200
You...

502
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,920
It must be hard for me.

503
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,160
Enough. Stop it.

504
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:09,840
What are you going to do for the summer vacation?

505
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,240
For the summer vacation,

506
00:21:11,240 --> 00:21:12,840
I'm going to the Hualan team to practice.

507
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:15,560
I haven't seen the real Hualan team perform.

508
00:21:16,120 --> 00:21:17,120
Then we'll train next time.

509
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,840
I'll count on you.

510
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:18,760
Okay.

511
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:20,360
Dongdong,

512
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,760
do you want to go with me?

513
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:23,480
No, I have something to do.

514
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,640
Are you going to

515
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:28,640
take care of the library again?

516
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:29,600
No.

517
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,200
I'm going back to Wan Gongjia.

518
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,920
How can I make money to go back to Wan Gongjia?

519
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,880
It's hard to imagine that

520
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:41,200
after this summer vacation,

521
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:43,360
I became the great teacher in our school.

522
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:45,520
That's right.

523
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:48,440
It's not a good news for learning,

524
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,120
but a news for opening the eyes.

525
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,520
Zhu Dongdong,

526
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:54,880
it's time for you to go to the library.

527
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,160
Okay, I'm coming.

528
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,880
Dongdong has been staying

529
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,040
in the countryside for a long time.

530
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,320
He's doing agriculture,

531
00:22:00,320 --> 00:22:01,480
he's doing exercise,

532
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,560
he's doing hair and hair.

533
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,520
Before he started his studies,

534
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:05,600
he went to do eye surgery.

535
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:07,440
On the first day of his college,

536
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,120
everyone was looking forward to it.

537
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:28,920
Let's go.

538
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:31,640
Jiao Xin.

539
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:33,320
Stand there.

540
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,720
What a coincidence.

541
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:41,200
We're in the same class.

542
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,800
Didn't I ask you to choose a class?

543
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,240
Why did you choose Li Ke?

544
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:45,880
I'm not bad at choosing Li Ke.

545
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:47,120
Why can't I choose Li Ke?

546
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:48,680
You're better at choosing a class.

547
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,320
Why don't you listen to me?

548
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:51,720
Do you want to hide from me?

549
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,520
If you want to hide from me,

550
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,600
I won't bother you anymore.

551
00:22:58,680 --> 00:22:59,600
My god.

552
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,200
I guess I have to hide.

553
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,000
You...

554
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:23,800
What's this?

555
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:24,960
And this.

556
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:26,080
How many?

557
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:27,080
I'll take the number 3200.

558
00:23:29,080 --> 00:23:30,080
What about me?

559
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,080
Shengnan.

560
00:23:37,080 --> 00:23:39,080
I'll be separated from you.

561
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:41,080
No way.

562
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:42,080
Look.

563
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:44,080
Jiao Xin, Wenjing.

564
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:45,080
And Dundong.

565
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:47,080
Can you do it alone?

566
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:48,080
That's good.

567
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:50,080
I still have several jobs.

568
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,080
Anyway, we'll be next door.

569
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,080
We'll take care of it.

570
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:54,080
Okay.

571
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,080
No.

572
00:23:55,080 --> 00:23:56,080
Did you see Dundong?

573
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,080
Why didn't you see him?

574
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,080
Dundong.

575
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,080
No.

576
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,080
No.

577
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:15,080
Jiao Xin, Wenjing.

578
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:17,080
We're in the same class again.

579
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:18,080
What a coincidence.

580
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,080
Really?

581
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,080
Why are you helping Li Ke?

582
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:21,080
What do you mean?

583
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
I'm weird when I help Li Ke.

584
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,080
I'll sit here.

585
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:26,080
You're really...

586
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:31,080
Why didn't you see Dundong?

587
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:32,080
I didn't see him.

588
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,080
Teacher.

589
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:39,080
You're waiting for your turn.

590
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:50,080
It's not a good idea.

591
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:51,080
It's not a good idea.

592
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:54,080
I'm getting stronger.

593
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:57,080
Something happened.

594
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,080
What's wrong with you?

595
00:24:59,080 --> 00:25:00,080
Come out and see.

596
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,080
You're a monster.

597
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:02,080
You're laughing.

598
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,080
You're not running away.

599
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,080
What?

600
00:25:15,080 --> 00:25:17,080
Hello, students.

601
00:25:17,080 --> 00:25:19,080
I'm your class president.

602
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,080
I'm your class president, Yan Li.

603
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:22,080
Yan Su's Yan.

604
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:25,080
I'm Mo Li's Li.

605
00:25:25,080 --> 00:25:27,080
I'm your class president,

606
00:25:27,080 --> 00:25:28,080
and I'm your class president.

607
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:29,080
You're the students.

608
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:30,080
I'm your class president.

609
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:31,080
You're our class president.

610
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:34,080
We're a big family.

611
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:37,080
I hope you can all be together

612
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:39,080
and help each other.

613
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,080
Let's make a common step.

614
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,080
Let's go.

615
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,080
The first classmate

616
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:50,080
went to get the textbook with me.

617
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:51,080
We'll start over

618
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:53,080
after we get back to the class.

619
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,080
Hello, classmate.

620
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,080
I'm Ming Sun.

621
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
I know.

622
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,080
You know my name?

623
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,080
Do you know who I am?

624
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:09,080
You're right.

625
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,080
I'm just a family member.

626
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:11,080
You can't recognize me.

627
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,080
What?

628
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:15,080
It's me.

629
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,080
Zhu Dongdong.

630
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,080
You're Zhu Dongdong?

631
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:41,080
The youth is so lively.

632
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:45,080
The sun is hiding in the clouds.

633
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:47,080
I walk on the street.

634
00:26:47,080 --> 00:26:49,080
I'm so excited.

635
00:26:49,080 --> 00:26:52,080
I'm running to the small store on the street.

636
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:56,080
I'm so busy.

637
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,080
The sun is shining.

638
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,080
I'm so excited.

639
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:03,080
I see your smile.

640
00:27:03,080 --> 00:27:05,080
I'm going to the best place.

641
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:06,080
Qiaoqiao.

642
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,080
The wind is blowing.

643
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:10,080
The wind is blowing.

644
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:14,080
Let's feel the starlight together.

645
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:16,080
We're holding hands.

646
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,080
We smile.

647
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,080
We dream together.

648
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:21,080
Let's start over.

649
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:22,080
My friend.

650
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:24,080
You're my friend.

Let's make a beautiful dream together.

656
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,080
