1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,960
The light shines on countless scars,

2
00:00:01,960 --> 00:00:03,760
as hard as it is to erase.

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,520
The price I paid

4
00:00:06,520 --> 00:00:08,040
has been melted in time.

5
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,800
I've been through it.

6
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:12,920
How to get rid of your madness?

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:15,720
It's easy to turn into a breeze.

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,720
Let everything turn into glory.

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:22,040
I'm not afraid of the night.

10
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:23,400
Listen.

11
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,600
That's your favorite voice.

12
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:29,400
I can't forget your back.

13
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:32,060
Love is a kind of

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:33,840
lucky charm.

15
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:35,320
Listen.

16
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:38,480
That's your favorite voice.

17
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:41,360
I can't wake up from this dream.

18
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,360
Let everything turn into a secret.

19
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,880
You and I will protect each other.

20
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,880
The Love by Hypnotic

21
00:00:58,960 --> 00:00:59,640
Listen.

22
00:00:59,880 --> 00:01:02,720
That's your favorite voice.

23
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:05,720
I can't forget your back.

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,880
Love is a kind of

25
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,560
lucky charm.

26
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:11,640
Listen.

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,720
That's your favorite voice.

28
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:17,560
I can't forget your back.

29
00:01:17,960 --> 00:01:20,880
Love is a kind of

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,440
lucky charm.

31
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,760
Listen.

32
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:26,840
That's your favorite voice.

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,520
I can't wake up from this dream.

34
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:32,880
Let everything turn into a secret.

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,960
You and I will protect each other.

36
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:40,720
Where's Lin Sen?

37
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:42,600
I know.

38
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:44,440
You know my name?

39
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:45,960
Then do you know who I am?

40
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,160
I can't recognize you without seeing me.

41
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:52,800
What?

42
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,320
It's me.

43
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,400
Zhu Dongdong.

44
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,480
Are you Zhu Dongdong?

45
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:02,800
No way.

46
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,400
Impossible.

47
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,840
How can you be Zhu Dongdong?

48
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,120
Zhu... Zhu Dongdong?

49
00:02:08,440 --> 00:02:09,720
Where are your glasses?

50
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:11,640
I'll use them to get my operation done.

51
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,040
Where's your height?

52
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,680
I didn't expect to wear so high.

53
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:17,440
You're wearing such a high-cut.

54
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:18,880
What's wrong with your skin color?

55
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:21,240
You're learning to enjoy the beauty of the dark, right?

56
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,480
I got sunburned by accident.

57
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,960
Sunburned by accident?

58
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:26,880
You got sunburned on the edge of your body.

59
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,680
You're normal.

60
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:29,080
How can you get sunburned like this?

61
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:29,800
Not bad.

62
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:31,240
I know I'm the hottest on the edge of my body.

63
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:32,600
I'm not too uneducated.

64
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:33,600
Go, go, go.

65
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,920
Look at your muscles.

66
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:37,720
You're exaggerating.

67
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:38,920
You're a summer vacation.

68
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,600
Dongdong, you're a real changeable person.

69
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:43,960
I'm fine.

70
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,200
I'm really not used to it when I grow up.

71
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,520
I'm used to it when I see too much.

72
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:51,440
Don't you believe me?

73
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,640
No.

74
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:53,800
I don't know.

75
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:10,400
A'Yue.

76
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,880
A'Yue.

77
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,200
What are you buying?

78
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,760
Why...

79
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:18,640
I'm sorry, bro.

80
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,400
I... I mistook you for someone else.

81
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,760
I thought you were my bro.

82
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:22,840
Hui.

83
00:03:23,320 --> 00:03:24,200
Long time no see.

84
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,480
Brother Nan, long time no see.

85
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,600
I saw you just now.

86
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:31,640
I thought you were with A'Yue.

87
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:32,920
So I mistook you for someone else.

88
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,520
Sorry, bro.

89
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:40,160
Yes.

90
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,600
He's my classmate.

91
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:42,960
Not bad, Brother Nan.

92
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,880
You're quite different from Dongdong.

93
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:47,680
You're quite a good student.

94
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,000
You're like a handsome man.

95
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:51,960
Bro.

96
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,560
I'm Zhang Wen.

97
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,880
Please give me some advice.

98
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,640
Stop it.

99
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,320
He's Zhu Dongdong.

100
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:03,600
Dongdong?

101
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,400
You... You're Dongdong?

102
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,040
You're so tall.

103
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:08,640
You...

104
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:10,480
You're Cheng Rong?

105
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:11,480
Where are your glasses?

106
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:13,080
Sec Hana's

107
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,160
No.

108
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,120
The right가지ins.

109
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:18,960
Hello, um...

110
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,800
Not to Call me Cheng Rong.

111
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,420
Just call me

112
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,960
Musician Xie.

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:36,400
Great.

114
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:39,960
How exhausted I am.

115
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:40,880
It's happened again.

116
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,080
What happened again?

117
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,280
Come out and take a look.

118
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:44,880
You are hiding behind a cover, you know?

119
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,280
You are walking with such filial piety.

120
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:47,800
What?

121
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:48,720
What are you talking about again?

122
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,520
Dongdong.

123
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,000
I mean Zhu Dongdong.

124
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,080
Dongdong?

125
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,280
What's wrong with him?

126
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:54,920
I said something and was can't explain it properly.

127
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:55,760
You come out and have a look immediately!

128
00:04:55,960 --> 00:04:56,560
Wait, wait.

129
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,120
But wait, wait!

130
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,160
Don't go out, stop it.

131
00:05:02,420 --> 00:05:03,680
Make one quick run.

132
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:04,600
Quick, go soon.

133
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,880
Quick, go quickly!

134
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:06,720
Quick, sub!

135
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,160
Unsayı.

136
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,240
Hurry up.

137
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,080
Wait.

138
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,520
Go.

139
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,040
Here you are.

140
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,040
I want to eat it.

141
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:35,360
It's amazing.

142
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,080
I still can't believe it.

143
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Although you're a few years younger than us,

144
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,640
but the change of a holiday

145
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,160
is so amazing.

146
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:47,360
Zhu Dongdong has big eyes.

147
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:49,160
But he can't hide his eyes.

148
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:50,960
He used to be short.

149
00:05:51,200 --> 00:05:53,680
Since I gave him milk and an egg,

150
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:55,040
he's not only tall but also handsome.

151
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,080
Wait.

152
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,320
I've been suffering from diabetes since I was a kid.

153
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,320
I don't drink milk.

154
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:01,280
And does it have anything to do with you?

155
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,280
Of course.

156
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:03,440
I saw you make up for it.

157
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,760
Why do you have a feeling

158
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:07,040
of a child growing up without a home?

159
00:06:07,960 --> 00:06:10,720
This kid is so old.

160
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,800
Don't be so annoying.

161
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,600
I don't believe you.

162
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:19,680
I'm full.

163
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,840
You finished it so quickly.

164
00:06:22,320 --> 00:06:22,960
I'll go first.

165
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,880
Wait.

166
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,760
Zhu Dongdong

167
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,160
Wait.

168
00:06:58,160 --> 00:06:58,920
Zhou Yue.

169
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,080
You're not a docile.

170
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:03,000
Why are you acting as if it's not necessary?

171
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,000
Zhou Yue.

172
00:07:07,040 --> 00:07:08,040
What's wrong with him?

173
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,640
Nothing.

174
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,040
He's just embarrassed.

175
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:13,040
It'll be fine in a while.

176
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,040
It's yours.

177
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:16,640
It's really delicious.

178
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:18,040
Why are you holding my chicken wings?

179
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
Why are you holding my chicken wings?

180
00:07:36,840 --> 00:07:37,640
Xiao Yang.

181
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:38,640
I'm here.

182
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:42,640
What does it mean for a boy and a girl to have a meal together?

183
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,240
Please wait.

184
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,440
This is for you.

185
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,240
I'll have a strawberry.

186
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:52,040
A man and a woman share food is a more intimate behavior.

187
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,640
They are willing to eat the food that the other person has bitten.

188
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,840
It means that this relationship is more ambiguous.

189
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:00,040
Then,

190
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,440
what does it mean for a girl to touch a boy's head?

191
00:08:04,040 --> 00:08:06,440
A girl touches a boy's head because she likes it.

192
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:09,440
She wants to have some simple physical contact with him.

193
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,840
For example, touching the head, touching the face, holding hands.

194
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,440
Especially when the boy doesn't resist,

195
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:16,440
it will make the girl feel satisfied.

196
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:17,640
There's one last question.

197
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,640
What if the boy sees a girl

198
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,840
and his heart beats faster?

199
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,240
I'm checking it for you. Please wait.

200
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:38,840
The boy sees a girl and his heart beats faster.

201
00:08:39,040 --> 00:08:40,840
There may be two situations.

202
00:08:41,040 --> 00:08:44,840
The first one is that the boy is a man of nature and has a fighting heart.

203
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:47,640
The second one is that the boy sees a girl and his heart beats faster.

204
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:49,840
It means that he has a crush on her.

205
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:52,640
It may be that he has feelings for the girl.

206
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,640
It's easy to say that he likes the word,

207
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,440
but it's actually very complicated.

208
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:17,040
I like you.

209
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:42,240
I like you.

210
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:46,640
You're so good at this.

211
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,240
Didn't the teacher teach you this before?

212
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,640
How could you make a mistake?

213
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,040
Did he teach me?

214
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,640
You hit me.

215
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:00,240
I...

216
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:01,840
You're so uneducated.

217
00:10:02,440 --> 00:10:03,640
Aren't you a student?

218
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
What?

219
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,040
Zhou Yue, why are you here?

220
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:10,240
What's wrong?

221
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,640
I can't come to you after work?

222
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:12,840
Of course not.

223
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:15,040
You ran away after dinner last night.

224
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:17,240
I went to your class and didn't see you.

225
00:10:17,440 --> 00:10:18,440
Where did you go?

226
00:10:19,640 --> 00:10:20,640
I didn't do anything.

227
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,240
Are you hiding from me?

228
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,040
Let's go to the 3-on-3.

229
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:30,240
They're waiting in the hall.

230
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,040
Of course.

231
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,040
Why?

232
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,840
You don't study anymore?

233
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:36,640
It's okay to work together.

234
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,040
Dongdong, we're leaving.

235
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:40,040
Wait for me.

236
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,440
You can teach me again.

237
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,040
I'm leaving.

238
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,240
I'm leaving.

239
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,440
I'm leaving.

240
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,640
I'm leaving.

241
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,840
I'm leaving.

242
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:50,040
I'm leaving.

243
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,240
I'm leaving.

244
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,440
I'm leaving.

245
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,640
I'm leaving.

246
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,840
I'm leaving.

247
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,040
I'm leaving.

248
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:57,240
I'm leaving.

249
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,440
I'm leaving.

250
00:10:58,640 --> 00:10:59,640
I'm leaving.

251
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:00,840
I'm leaving.

252
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,040
I'm leaving.

253
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:03,240
I'm leaving.

254
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:04,440
I'm leaving.

255
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,640
I'm leaving.

256
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,040
I'm leaving.

257
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,040
You're here.

258
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:10,240
You're here.

259
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:11,440
Let's play.

260
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:12,240
Okay.

261
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:18,240
Play!

262
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:21,240
Come on.

263
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,840
Come on.

264
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,040
Come on.

265
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:25,240
Come on.

266
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:28,240
Come on.

267
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:29,440
I think it's because

268
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,240
Zhou Yanzu is so good.

269
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:32,440
He's so good.

270
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:33,640
He's so good.

271
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,840
He's so good.

272
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,040
He's so good.

273
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,040
Zhou Yue is so good.

274
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,640
Why don't you go to visit him later?

275
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,840
I asked you to visit him.

276
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,240
Why do you ask Shengnan to visit him?

277
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,840
I'm in the same neighborhood with Zhang Weitong.

278
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:44,240
I know his route better.

279
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,240
I'm familiar with him.

280
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:46,640
He wants to play in the inner circle.

281
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:48,240
If he goes out and plays with Zhou Yue,

282
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,440
he will pass in a step.

283
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,840
Although he is not tall,

284
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:52,440
I heard you are fast.

285
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,240
And you play so well with Zhou Yue.

286
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,440
So you can go with him

287
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:57,840
and keep an eye on him.

288
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,640
I can't stop him.

289
00:11:59,840 --> 00:12:01,040
But I have to say first.

290
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,640
I'm familiar with Zhou Yue.

291
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:04,840
He never resists me when I play.

292
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,040
It's okay, Shengnan.

293
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,240
The game is the game.

294
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,240
I know.

295
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:10,640
Let's make a deal.

296
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,040
The first round of the first round of the first round of the first round

297
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,040
is over.

298
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,240
The losing team will have a drink.

299
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,040
How about it?

300
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:15,840
Come on.

301
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:17,040
Who will play?

302
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,240
Come on. Go.

303
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,040
Let's go.

304
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:21,640
Let go.

305
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:22,240
Let go.

306
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:23,040
Come on.

307
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:25,240
Shoot.

308
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,040
Good shot.

309
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,040
Great.

310
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,040
Good shot.

311
00:12:41,240 --> 00:12:42,040
Good shot.

312
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:45,840
Good shot.

313
00:12:59,040 --> 00:12:59,840
Good shot.

314
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,040
Good shot.

315
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:13,840
It's so hot.

316
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:15,040
Let me take off my clothes.

317
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:16,440
Don't catch a cold.

318
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,840
It's so hot.

319
00:13:18,040 --> 00:13:19,040
How can I catch a cold?

320
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:19,640
Yang Yang.

321
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,040
Help me take it.

322
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:21,840
Thanks.

323
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:27,040
Zhou Yue, let me wipe the towel.

324
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,040
This is my towel.

325
00:13:29,840 --> 00:13:31,240
I don't mind.

326
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:33,440
But I used it before.

327
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:36,640
I got it.

328
00:13:41,640 --> 00:13:43,040
Next time, try to use your towel.

329
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,240
All right. I see.

330
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:46,240
Fine. It's your pay.

331
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:48,640
Come on. Do it.

332
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:49,640
Here it comes.

333
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:50,640
Go on.

334
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:51,840
Come on.

335
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:52,640
Come on.

336
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:54,440
Go on.

337
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,840
Is it hot?

338
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:56,440
All right.

339
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,240
Come on.

340
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:57,840
Yue.

341
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:58,440
Yue.

342
00:13:58,640 --> 00:13:59,040
Chen Yue.

343
00:13:59,240 --> 00:13:59,840
Come on.

344
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:01,840
Come on.

345
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:30,440
I'll do it.

346
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:36,000
What are you doing, Yue?

347
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
You're playing so hard with the men.

348
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,160
No.

349
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,840
Relax.

350
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,720
Don't be so tight.

351
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:42,760
If you keep playing hard,

352
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:43,840
Xiao Yue will be more anxious.

353
00:14:46,520 --> 00:14:47,560
Come on, keep going.

354
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,720
Tie it.

355
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:51,440
Tie it tighter.

356
00:15:04,840 --> 00:15:05,760
Go.

357
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,680
Yes, yes.

358
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,680
Go, go, go.

359
00:15:21,280 --> 00:15:23,320
Go.

360
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,120
Give it to me.

361
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,880
Go, go.

362
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,200
You can't even grab the ball.

363
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:31,080
Enough is enough.

364
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,120
Go.

365
00:15:36,720 --> 00:15:38,680
Go.

366
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,640
Perfect.

367
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:47,360
Shoot it off.

368
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:48,920
Come up.

369
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,440
Great shot.

370
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,120
That's great.

371
00:16:00,200 --> 00:16:01,360
Yue, go for it!

372
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,760
Go for it!

373
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:13,720
Come on, Zhengyue.

374
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:26,680
Come on.

375
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:30,840
Come on, Team C.

376
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:41,880
Come on!

377
00:16:48,200 --> 00:16:48,480
Countdown.

378
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:50,040
valid

379
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
Well here

380
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,240
trusted

381
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,240
Yu Baby

382
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,040
come

383
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,040
What's wrong?

384
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,040
Are you okay, Nan?

385
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:20,520
Shengnan!

386
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,840
I didn't mean to hurt you.

387
00:17:22,840 --> 00:17:24,040
What are you doing?

388
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,040
Zhou Yue, why are you so careless?

389
00:17:28,040 --> 00:17:30,040
Yao Yao, it's not Zhou Yue's fault.

390
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,040
I was too harsh.

391
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Besides, I'm not hurt when I play.

392
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,040
I'm really fine.

393
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,040
Look, I'm really fine.

394
00:17:40,040 --> 00:17:41,040
Slowly, slowly.

395
00:17:42,040 --> 00:17:43,040
Let's continue playing.

396
00:17:43,040 --> 00:17:45,040
Don't go. You just got hit. You're still playing?

397
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,040
I'm really fine. Look at me.

398
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:48,040
I'm really fine.

399
00:17:50,040 --> 00:17:51,040
I'll take it back.

400
00:17:51,040 --> 00:17:52,040
I didn't lie to you, did I?

401
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:55,040
I never let Zhou Yue play.

402
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:57,040
Yes, you two are too good.

403
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:00,040
Zhou Yue, you should go to the bathroom in Shengnan.

404
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,040
Yes.

405
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,040
No.

406
00:18:02,040 --> 00:18:03,040
I'll take you to the bathroom.

407
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,040
You don't have to be so nervous.

408
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:05,040
Don't be so...

409
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,040
Go quickly.

410
00:18:06,040 --> 00:18:07,040
I'm really fine.

411
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,040
Don't be so nervous.

412
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,040
Zhou Yue.

413
00:18:09,040 --> 00:18:10,040
I'm really fine.

414
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,040
Zhou Yue, put me down.

415
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:12,040
Slowly.

416
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,040
Do you want to...

417
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,040
Put me down.

418
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,040
Put me down.

419
00:18:15,040 --> 00:18:16,040
Zhou Yue.

420
00:18:16,040 --> 00:18:17,040
I'm really fine.

421
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,040
Monitor.

422
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,040
Don't go.

423
00:18:21,040 --> 00:18:23,040
Look at how Nan Ge is acting.

424
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,040
It's just a small injury.

425
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:27,040
Are you afraid that your score is lower than mine?

426
00:18:27,040 --> 00:18:29,040
So you can stop the competition.

427
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,040
Zhou Yue.

428
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:31,040
Don't worry.

429
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:32,040
I'm here.

430
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:39,040
You just let Zhou Yue take care of Nan Ge, right?

431
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,040
I'm here.

432
00:18:56,040 --> 00:18:58,040
Teacher, please be gentle.

433
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:00,040
You only just rubbed it once or twice.

434
00:19:00,040 --> 00:19:01,040
And you're still in pain.

435
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:04,040
Should I rub it or not?

436
00:19:04,040 --> 00:19:05,040
Rub it.

437
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:08,040
One said rub and the other said not to rub.

438
00:19:08,040 --> 00:19:09,040
I'll listen to you.

439
00:19:09,040 --> 00:19:11,040
Please rub it for him.

440
00:19:11,040 --> 00:19:12,040
He has a wound here.

441
00:19:12,040 --> 00:19:13,040
He can't afford to be too emotional.

442
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,040
Rub it a few times more.

443
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,040
You can melt the blood.

444
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,040
No, teacher.

445
00:19:16,040 --> 00:19:17,040
Thank you.

446
00:19:17,040 --> 00:19:19,040
This is nothing.

447
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:21,040
Actually, he doesn't hurt anymore.

448
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,040
So please don't rub it.

449
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:29,040
How about this?

450
00:19:29,040 --> 00:19:30,040
I'll give you this bottle of red flower oil.

451
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:32,040
You can take it back and rub it for him.

452
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:33,040
Is it free?

453
00:19:33,040 --> 00:19:34,040
Yes.

454
00:19:47,040 --> 00:19:48,040
What's wrong with him?

455
00:19:48,040 --> 00:19:50,040
He got injured by accident.

456
00:19:50,040 --> 00:19:51,040
You're so crazy tonight.

457
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,040
How could you get injured?

458
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,040
I've said it eight hundred times.

459
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,040
I'm fine.

460
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,040
It's my bad.

461
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,040
Shengnan.

462
00:19:58,040 --> 00:19:59,040
Take this red flower oil.

463
00:19:59,040 --> 00:20:00,040
You must rub it.

464
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,040
And

465
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:03,040
what kind of running leg do you need today?

466
00:20:03,040 --> 00:20:04,040
Just tell me.

467
00:20:04,040 --> 00:20:05,040
I'll buy it for you.

468
00:20:05,040 --> 00:20:06,040
Okay.

469
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,040
Actually, I want

470
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,040
to eat roasted sausages from the service department.

471
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:13,040
You're deliberately taking advantage of others.

472
00:20:15,040 --> 00:20:16,040
Don't buy too much.

473
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:17,040
Just buy one.

474
00:20:17,040 --> 00:20:18,040
Two.

475
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:19,040
Three.

476
00:20:20,040 --> 00:20:21,040
I don't need it.

477
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:23,040
Okay, no problem.

478
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,040
I'll buy it right now.

479
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:25,040
Xiao Yue.

480
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:28,040
What are you doing?

481
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:29,040
I fell down.

482
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,040
I didn't catch a cold.

483
00:20:30,040 --> 00:20:31,040
I'll infect you.

484
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:33,040
I

485
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:35,040
want to give you this.

486
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,040
Your team is indeed the leader.

487
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,040
So I'm willing to give it to you.

488
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,040
Please drink water.

489
00:20:41,040 --> 00:20:42,040
You drank it before.

490
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:43,040
Yes.

491
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,040
What's wrong?

492
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:46,040
I used to drink your water.

493
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:47,040
I've never disliked you.

494
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:49,040
No, Shengnan.

495
00:20:49,040 --> 00:20:50,040
It's different now.

496
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:53,040
Actually, I also feel

497
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:55,040
it's different.

498
00:20:55,040 --> 00:20:57,040
You've been a little abnormal recently.

499
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,040
You're always

500
00:20:58,040 --> 00:20:59,040
wandering around when you play.

501
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,040
You don't care about your heart.

502
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:03,040
We used to be close.

503
00:21:03,040 --> 00:21:05,040
We only had to wear the same pants.

504
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:06,040
Now you can't bear to

505
00:21:06,040 --> 00:21:07,040
lend me a towel.

506
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:09,040
You just got a job

507
00:21:09,040 --> 00:21:11,040
and you're so deep.

508
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
You still treat me as a good brother.

509
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
I'm sorry, Shengnan.

510
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,040
You're not on the same page.

511
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,040
You two are not on the same page.

512
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,040
I'll go buy something first.

513
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:25,040
Guo Ran wants me to send it to you.

514
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,040
You...

515
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,040
I'll go buy it.

516
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,040
Do you smell

517
00:21:37,040 --> 00:21:38,040
Tian Tian's scent?

518
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,040
Tian Tian?

519
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,040
I smell it too.

520
00:21:50,040 --> 00:21:51,040
I should have asked Zhou Yue

521
00:21:51,040 --> 00:21:53,040
to buy me candied chestnuts.

522
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:55,040
I want to eat candied chestnuts too.

523
00:21:57,040 --> 00:21:58,040
I'm sorry.

524
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,040
I'll go buy it.

525
00:22:00,040 --> 00:22:01,040
I'll go buy it.

526
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:04,040
I'll go buy it.

527
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:05,040
I'll go buy it.

528
00:22:05,040 --> 00:22:06,040
I'll go buy it.

529
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,040
Didn't the competition

530
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,040
call off in advance?

531
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,040
You did get the lead.

532
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,040
I'm willing to give up.

533
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,040
Please drink water.

534
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:29,040
You drank it?

535
00:22:29,040 --> 00:22:31,040
Yes. What's wrong?

536
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,040
Yang Yang, you're here.

537
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:45,720
So much food.

538
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,520
You're so in sync. You know I like to eat candied dates.

539
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,800
I happen to want to eat this.

540
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,200
Shengnan, are your feet really okay?

541
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:58,520
I'm fine. Look.

542
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,240
It only hurt a little.

543
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:02,880
It's because Zhou Yue was nervous.

544
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:10,880
Shengnan, do you think Zhou Yue has been acting strange lately?

545
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,880
Since we split up, Zhou Yue has been acting strange.

546
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:16,080
He doesn't do anything.

547
00:23:16,760 --> 00:23:19,880
Do you know why he's like that?

548
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:22,280
If he doesn't say it, how would I know what he's thinking?

549
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:26,120
He's just a friend. Why is he so quiet?

550
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:31,200
Shengnan, do you really think Zhou Yue is...

551
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:34,080
a friend?

552
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,080
Of course.

553
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:39,080
I'm the most loyal person.

554
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:42,080
We used to be friends at the basketball court.

555
00:23:42,080 --> 00:23:47,080
Although he's been a little cold to me lately.

556
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:50,080
Since he bought me so much food,

557
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:52,080
I still think of him as a brother.

558
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:59,080
What about me?

559
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,480
I mean, I've never been your friend before.

560
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:08,480
Now that we're in different classes, am I like Zhou Yue?

561
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,480
I'm a friend you think I am.

562
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:15,880
Of course.

563
00:24:17,080 --> 00:24:19,080
Who can compare to you?

564
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,880
Then who can compare to you?

565
00:24:45,080 --> 00:24:48,080
Young birds in the morning get up early

566
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:51,080
The sun hides in the clouds

567
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:53,480
I walk on the street

568
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:56,480
The wind blows, the waves are noisy

569
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:59,480
The sun is just turning

570
00:24:59,480 --> 00:25:03,480
I look around, I see your smile
