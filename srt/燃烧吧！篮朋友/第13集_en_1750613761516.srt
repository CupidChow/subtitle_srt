1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,000
That's your favorite voice

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,000
I can't forget you

3
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So love is an excuse

4
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
Don't give up

5
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Listen, that's your favorite voice

6
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,000
I can't forget you

7
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
So love is an excuse

8
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
Don't give up

9
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Listen, that's your voice

10
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:30,000
In the process, the surprise will never stop

11
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,000
But the hug becomes a secret

12
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
Guarding you and me

13
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Episode 19

14
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
Where is the discounted snacks?

15
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Over there

16
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Thank you

17
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,000
Cuiyu

18
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Are you Cuiyu?

19
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
It's me

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
I'm Hui Juan

21
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
Baby, let me help you

22
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
This is the daughter of your father

23
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
To be honest

24
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Your Zhao Di and my daughter Shengnan

25
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Not a few years old

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,000
Why is he at this age

27
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Became a mother

28
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
In their country

29
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Which one is not just at the age of marriage

30
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,000
I was persuaded to get married

31
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
If it weren't for you

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
You should be the one who married Wang Daqiang

33
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Not me

34
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:55,000
Which hospital does Zhao Di live in now?

35
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Your son-in-law

36
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
Really won't pay a penny?

37
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,000
My life is bitter

38
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
My Zhao Di's life is even more bitter

39
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
I even gave birth to three daughters

40
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I didn't get well

41
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
The poor family can only work in the field

42
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
My son-in-law who killed the world

43
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
When he heard that the operation cost so much

44
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Send him back to his mother's house

45
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
He ran away because he had no money

46
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Zhao Di

47
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Now he is still lying in the hospital

48
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,000
This operation costs 50,000 yuan

49
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
50,000 yuan

50
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Look at me, a rural woman

51
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Where can I find so much money?

52
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Cuiyu, don't worry

53
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,000
We'll figure out how to get the money

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
I really have no way

55
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
I've been in the hospital for a while

56
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
I can't get the money for the operation

57
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I'm telling you, don't bother me anymore

58
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
This thing doesn't work

59
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Old Lin

60
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
This is a matter of life and death

61
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You can't just die

62
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Die or not

63
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,000
Do we have to

64
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
According to the actual situation of our family

65
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,000
What are the conditions of our family

66
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,000
You don't know

67
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
50,000 yuan

68
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Just borrow

69
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Moreover

70
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:12,000
You and your idol

71
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I haven't seen it for a few years

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,000
How do you know which of his words is true

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Which one is false

74
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
Cuiyu and I have been friends since childhood

75
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
If he hadn't protected me

76
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
I can't leave there at all

77
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Just because I left the country

78
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
He married Wang Daqiang

79
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
He's suffering for me

80
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Please be clear

81
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
How many years ago is this

82
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,000
Without you

83
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
There is no Wang Daqiang

84
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
He can still marry you

85
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
What's the village

86
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Zhang Sanli Temple

87
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Moreover

88
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
You must figure it out

89
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,000
What you are talking about now is

90
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
It's completely different from borrowing money

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
You can't mix it with me

92
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Old Lin

93
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
He's a little bit older than our Shengnan

94
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
You said he was a little boy

95
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I should have gone to school

96
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Now I've grown up too early

97
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Got sick

98
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
He still has three young children

99
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If you lose your mother like this

100
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
How do you let them live

101
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
How do they live

102
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Have you ever thought

103
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,000
50,000 yuan

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
50,000 yuan

105
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
50,000 yuan

106
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Have you ever thought

107
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Once these 50,000 yuan are borrowed

108
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
What if you're cheated

109
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
How do we live

110
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Not right

111
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
What's wrong with you today

112
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
You're wrong

113
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't you usually

114
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Is it reasonable?

115
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why can't I tell you anything today

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Correct

117
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
You are kind

118
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
I have no opinion

119
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
But we have to do it with force

120
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
The family has a difficult gold

121
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,000
We can't do it because of other people's business

122
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Put all the blood in your family

123
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Then our family won't be able to live

124
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Anyway, I've made a decision

125
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
I know

126
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:55,000
It's not easy to make money for this family

127
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I don't move the money you earned early in the morning

128
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,000
When we got married

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,000
I don't have a family

130
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You bought me a bracelet

131
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Uncle asked me to be a price

132
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,000
Does this count?

133
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,000
Count

134
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,000
And when Shengnan was alive

135
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
When Shengnan was alive

136
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I bought those gold chains

137
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:15,000
You said it was my decision

138
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,000
Does this count?

139
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Count

140
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
What's wrong

141
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
I was going to keep these things

142
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,000
When Shengnan was big

143
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Give it to him together

144
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Since I have an emergency now

145
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
I'm going to be his

146
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
It's worth 20,000 yuan anyway

147
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,000
I'll pay the salary in two days

148
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Salary and subsidies

149
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
I'm going to send all these to Cui Yu

150
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Wang Huijuan

151
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,000
I think you're crazy

152
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You still take the gold bracelet out

153
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Why don't you take this family

154
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Don't help me

155
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't take all the men out

156
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I tell you I'm going to call the police

157
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
You must have met a fraud

158
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I tell you

159
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I'll let the police tell you

160
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,000
I

161
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:56,000
What police

162
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What do I do

163
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
I know what I'm doing

164
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,000
Old Lin

165
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
This is a matter of life and death

166
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You said I didn't know before

167
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,000
Forget it

168
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,000
Now I'm in Cui Yu

169
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
I can't be invisible

170
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I must help

171
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
Can't expect

172
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,000
Old Lin

173
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Shut up

174
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,960
Sterling

175
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Is this a good thing

176
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
That place

177
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I didn't find one

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,000
Yummy

179
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Students

180
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,000
The fourth smiling discussion competition is about to take place

181
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,960
If you are interested,

182
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,960
you can sign up for the class.

183
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,960
Wenjing,

184
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,960
I'll leave the registration to you.

185
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:35,960
No,

186
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,960
I'm giving the teacher to the class monitor.

187
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:38,960
Why do you give it to me?

188
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:40,960
The student councilor can also be the head of the committee.

189
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:42,960
No,

190
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:44,960
at least you give me the number of people.

191
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:45,960
You are the class monitor.

192
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:46,960
You have to show your handsome face.

193
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:53,960
I'm not thinking of ways to make friends.

194
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:54,960
How about this?

195
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,960
You sign yourself up first.

196
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:58,960
I'll think of a way to get the rest.

197
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:06,960
Do you want to go to the competition?

198
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:07,960
I'll go.

199
00:09:07,960 --> 00:09:09,960
What if there's no one?

200
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:11,960
Why don't you sign up for me?

201
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,960
There's still time for the competition.

202
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:14,960
Are you sure?

203
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:15,960
I'm sure.

204
00:09:19,960 --> 00:09:21,960
You can go with me.

205
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:32,960
What?

206
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:34,920
What?

207
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:35,920
Look at this.

208
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:36,920
I left it for you.

209
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:37,920
This competition

210
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,920
can be said to be a two-way competition.

211
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,920
What do you want to draw for me again?

212
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,920
I have to give you my advice.

213
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:48,920
Listen to my details.

214
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:49,920
Stop.

215
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:50,920
I don't listen.

216
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,920
Don't think about the money anymore.

217
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:53,920
Wenjing,

218
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,920
I'll sign up for the debate.

219
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:56,920
What?

220
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,920
You sign up?

221
00:09:57,920 --> 00:09:58,920
Is it a boy group?

222
00:09:58,920 --> 00:09:59,920
It's a boy group.

223
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,920
It's a boy group.

224
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:01,920
It's a boy group.

225
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:03,880
It's a boy group.

226
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:07,880
You really signed up for the debate.

227
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,880
It's a debate, not a boy group.

228
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:10,880
Sheng,

229
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:11,880
can't you?

230
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:13,880
It's not that I can't.

231
00:10:13,880 --> 00:10:16,880
Why do you suddenly want to sign up for the debate?

232
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:17,880
Yes.

233
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:20,880
I don't think you're good at talking.

234
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,880
I'm not the one who's good at it.

235
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,880
People should try more

236
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,880
to know where their limits are.

237
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,880
Shengnan,

238
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
do you know

239
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,880
that the debate is very challenging

240
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,880
because of your logical thinking ability,

241
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:33,880
your ability to react on the spot,

242
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,880
and your ability to express yourself accurately.

243
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,880
Is it that hard?

244
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:40,880
You need to write the draft in advance

245
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:42,880
and determine your argument.

246
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,880
You also need to predict the other party's views.

247
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,880
More importantly,

248
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:49,880
you need to have a calm mind

249
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:51,880
and the courage to change the direction.

250
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:53,880
Then you won't be on the spot.

251
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:56,880
Dongdong,

252
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,880
why are you just trying to fool me?

253
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:00,880
Why didn't you say that earlier?

254
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:01,880
It's not hard for you.

255
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:03,880
I believe you can do it.

256
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:05,880
Don't worry, Shengnan.

257
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,880
You look at the topic first.

258
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Your teammates will help you

259
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:10,880
with the draft and thinking.

260
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:12,880
Yes, I have teammates.

261
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:14,880
Then I have nothing to worry about.

262
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:16,880
That's what I said, Shengnan.

263
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,880
But you're already a member of the debate team.

264
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:21,880
You have to be ready to go on the stage at any time.

265
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,880
That's right.

266
00:11:23,880 --> 00:11:26,880
Let's go to the small shop now.

267
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:27,880
Let's go.

268
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:28,880
I'll go with you.

269
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:30,880
Okay, let's go.

270
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:33,880
Bring me a bottle.

271
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:34,880
Okay.

272
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:36,880
Come here.

273
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,880
You really made people lose their minds this time.

274
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,880
Shengnan doesn't look like that kind of person.

275
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,880
What if he plays in the debate?

276
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,880
This is just a stage for him.

277
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,880
We just need to believe him.

278
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:55,880
He doesn't even know what the debate is.

279
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,880
What if something happens?

280
00:11:57,880 --> 00:11:59,880
Don't worry.

281
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,880
We just need to believe him.

282
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,880
Debate?

283
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,880
He took the wrong medicine.

284
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,880
Dongdong sent him there.

285
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:15,880
Can he do such a test of intelligence?

286
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,880
Who do you think is not intelligent?

287
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:20,880
I mean, you haven't practiced your Chinese yet.

288
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,880
Why are you going to debate again?

289
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:25,880
I'm going to debate about the development of the overall beauty of the system.

290
00:12:25,880 --> 00:12:26,880
You can do it.

291
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:27,880
Who's going to debate?

292
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,880
Isn't it just a fight?

293
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:30,880
Isn't it just a debate?

294
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,880
Who can't do it?

295
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:33,880
His class has been in the final.

296
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,880
You can still argue like that?

297
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:40,880
Their class's final strategy is Shengnan's first debate.

298
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,880
When his first debate is over, what will he do?

299
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,880
You just start a game of chess and play as an audience.

300
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,880
I'm going to call it a strategy.

301
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:51,880
You know what?

302
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:54,880
Our team has a division of work to cooperate.

303
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:57,880
You foreign companies don't come to talk.

304
00:12:57,880 --> 00:12:58,880
All right, all right.

305
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:01,880
Then we foreign companies will wish you a victory in advance.

306
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,880
I'm glad to see you.

307
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,880
Big brother.

308
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:07,880
Brother Jian.

309
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,880
I really want to take the opposite side this time.

310
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,880
This is a regular game.

311
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:28,880
I have no idea.

312
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:29,880
How can that work?

313
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,880
Since we've already chosen the right side,

314
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,880
we have to actively prepare for battle according to the right side's thinking.

315
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:36,880
How about this?

316
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
I think we should divide the position first.

317
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,880
After dividing the position, we go home separately.

318
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:43,880
We'll have to prepare for the fight.

319
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:45,880
I think we should prepare for the fight.

320
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,880
I think we should prepare for the fight.

321
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,880
After dividing the position, we go home separately.

322
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:51,880
We'll have to prepare for the fight.

323
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:52,880
Is that okay?

324
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,880
Okay.

325
00:13:53,880 --> 00:13:55,880
To be honest,

326
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:00,880
I'm really afraid that I can't accept the opponent's attack.

327
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:03,880
Jiaxin, you can't do this, you know?

328
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,880
Shengnan doesn't have much experience in debate.

329
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:07,880
He must be in the first round.

330
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,880
So you have to go into the game two or three times.

331
00:14:09,880 --> 00:14:10,880
Then...

332
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,880
How about...

333
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:14,880
Jiaxin, you go first?

334
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,880
Actually, I have a feeling for this debate.

335
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:18,880
Really?

336
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,880
Then, Shengnan, since you've agreed,

337
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:22,880
I'll just go first.

338
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:23,880
Don't worry.

339
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,880
I'll definitely win against you in the opening match.

340
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:27,880
Okay.

341
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:34,880
That's good.

342
00:14:34,880 --> 00:14:36,880
I'll go first.

343
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:37,880
Okay.

344
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:41,880
Since we're at the final,

345
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,880
it's rare for you to have your favorite debate.

346
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:45,880
Then, Jiaxin, you go first.

347
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,880
I'll go second and third with Yunyun.

348
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:50,880
We'll focus on the space.

349
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:51,880
I'll leave the fourth debate to you.

350
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,880
To summarize the words.

351
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:56,880
It's also good to share your dream and heart with everyone.

352
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,880
No problem.

353
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,880
Shengnan, can you really do it?

354
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:01,880
I can. I want to try.

355
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:05,880
You're not coming?

356
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,880
No.

357
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:10,880
I'm going.

358
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,880
We're at the final.

359
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,880
Why are you still so sad?

360
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:22,880
Don't mention it.

361
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,880
This time,

362
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:26,880
I'm not the same as before.

363
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,880
I'm the fourth debate that summarizes the words.

364
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,880
I heard that the good fourth debate

365
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:36,880
can turn the situation around with the help of the first-class.

366
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:41,880
So, how did I feel embarrassed to live?

367
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:44,880
I thought you had some plans.

368
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,880
It turns out that it's just a life that's hard to come by.

369
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:48,880
What else can we do?

370
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,880
We can only compete with our heads.

371
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,880
I heard that the third class is very strong.

372
00:15:52,880 --> 00:15:53,880
Jiaxin asked around.

373
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,880
They wrote the draft of the debate in one night.

374
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,880
They're all rehearsing.

375
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:03,880
I haven't even figured out the logic.

376
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:07,880
I won't drag everyone down this time.

377
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:09,880
Shengnan,

378
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,880
didn't you say that yourself?

379
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,880
You're just against your parents

380
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:16,880
and you're going to stick to your passion for the orchid

381
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,880
step by step.

382
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,880
That's true.

383
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:27,880
But I only quarrel with my dad every day.

384
00:16:27,880 --> 00:16:29,880
There's nothing to summarize.

385
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
This is not difficult.

386
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:31,880
It's not difficult.

387
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:33,880
The seed has already been seeded.

388
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:35,880
You have to pay attention to science.

389
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,880
You can summarize it with experience.

390
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,880
You're talking to me.

391
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:42,880
Your persistence is mainly divided into three points.

392
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:44,880
One, your passion.

393
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,880
Two, your friend's support.

394
00:16:45,880 --> 00:16:46,880
Three, you talk with your grades.

395
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,880
You can deal with it in these three ways.

396
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:51,880
Don't you have a reason to argue and refute with each other?

397
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,880
And Shengnan,

398
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:57,880
we should separate the relationship between the child and the parents.

399
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,880
First, you're an independent individual.

400
00:16:59,880 --> 00:17:01,880
The child is not a parent's property.

401
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:04,880
So the parents should respect your decision.

402
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,880
You're awesome.

403
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,880
Shengnan,

404
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:10,880
what do you want to express?

405
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:11,880
You decide.

406
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:13,880
We'll help you.

407
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:14,880
Okay.

408
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,880
Don't worry.

409
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,880
We'll be with you.

410
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,880
I'm full of confidence now.

411
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:20,880
Thank you.

412
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,880
I'm full of confidence now.

413
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Thank you.

414
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:34,880
I'm full of confidence now.

415
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Thank you.

416
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:37,880
I'm full of confidence now.

417
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:38,880
Thank you.

418
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
I'm full of confidence now.

419
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Thank you.

420
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:43,880
I'm full of confidence now.

421
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:44,880
Thank you.

422
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:46,880
I'm full of confidence now.

423
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:47,880
Thank you.

424
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,880
I'm full of confidence now.

425
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:50,880
Thank you.

426
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,880
I'm full of confidence now.

427
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:53,880
Thank you.

428
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,880
I'm full of confidence now.

429
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:56,880
Thank you.

430
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,880
I'm full of confidence now.

431
00:17:58,880 --> 00:18:00,880
I've thought about it these days.

432
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,680
The most important thing as a

433
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:03,880
four-time team is the ability to summarize.

434
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,880
As the last spokesperson of the team,

435
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:07,880
in addition to remembering the points of mutual competition

436
00:18:07,880 --> 00:18:09,880
between the two teams,

437
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:11,880
we also need to find the gaps of the other team.

438
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,880
Then, we can take good examples

439
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:14,880
to deepen the theme

440
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,880
and use the last chance to counterattack.

441
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:18,880
Good.

442
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,880
You've got it wrong.

443
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:23,880
Are you starting to write your lyrics now?

444
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:27,880
I just started.

445
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,880
It's okay, Shengnan.

446
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:32,880
You still have time.

447
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:34,880
I believe that

448
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:36,880
if you add your personal experience,

449
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:38,880
it will be very touching.

450
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:39,880
Yes.

451
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:40,880
Throw bricks into the water,

452
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,880
set a tone first,

453
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:42,880
and then tell your story.

454
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,880
The last thing is to draw a picture.

455
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,880
I think

456
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:46,880
the other team's lyrics

457
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,880
can't get away from these concepts.

458
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,880
First, the meaning of dreams to reality.

459
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,880
For example, dreams are unrealistic.

460
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:52,880
They can't support themselves.

461
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:53,880
Second,

462
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,880
dreams are not supported by parents.

463
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,880
If dreams can't be achieved for a long time,

464
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:58,880
it will be a great pressure

465
00:18:58,880 --> 00:19:00,880
for yourself and your family.

466
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,880
Third, why do you think

467
00:19:01,880 --> 00:19:03,880
your dream to persist is right?

468
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:04,880
But I think

469
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,880
these points are easy to break.

470
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:07,880
Tell the story first,

471
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:08,880
and then answer them one by one.

472
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,880
Dongdong,

473
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:10,880
I didn't expect you to be serious.

474
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
You're quite reliable.

475
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:13,880
I've always been excellent.

476
00:19:13,880 --> 00:19:14,880
I've never been surpassed.

477
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:18,880
You're so brilliant just by praising me.

478
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:19,880
You should write your lyrics now.

479
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,880
First, we need to figure out

480
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:26,880
what dreams are.

481
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:32,460
Dreams are not a

482
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,880
sky stage.

483
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:34,880
They are the struggle for reality.

484
00:19:58,880 --> 00:20:01,880
The sky stage is a stage

485
00:20:01,880 --> 00:20:03,880
where dreams are not a sky stage.

486
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:05,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

487
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:07,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

488
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:09,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

489
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:11,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

490
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

491
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

492
00:20:15,880 --> 00:20:17,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

493
00:20:17,880 --> 00:20:19,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

494
00:20:19,880 --> 00:20:21,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

495
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:23,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

496
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:25,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

497
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

498
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:29,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

499
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:31,880
It's a stage where dreams are not a sky stage.

500
00:20:45,880 --> 00:20:48,880
I just want to ask you

501
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,880
how is that thing going?

502
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,880
Should we have a wedding?

503
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,280
I'm busy.

504
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:04,480
Cui Yi, don't cry. Don't worry.

505
00:21:04,480 --> 00:21:08,880
When I get a job in a few days, I'll immediately go to the bank to transfer the money to you.

506
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:11,480
The surgery will surely go smoothly.

507
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,480
It's fine. Don't worry.

508
00:21:15,480 --> 00:21:18,880
Let's help Zhao Di'er get through this safe and sound surgery.

509
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,480
Okay.

510
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:24,080
Okay. Just like that.

511
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,280
Nan Nan, you're still awake?

512
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:42,080
I'm thirsty.

513
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:43,680
I'll get you some water.

514
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,880
Drink it up and go to bed early.

515
00:21:45,880 --> 00:21:47,480
Okay.

516
00:21:49,880 --> 00:21:53,480
Mom, who did you call just now?

517
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:57,080
A friend of my mom's.

518
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,480
Is she here to borrow money?

519
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:03,080
Just to make some money.

520
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:07,880
Is it possible that she's a fraud?

521
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:09,080
It won't be.

522
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:11,480
You've been with your mom and Auntie Cui Yi for so many years.

523
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:13,280
She won't lie to me.

524
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:16,080
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

525
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,880
I'm coming.

526
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:20,680
I'm coming.

527
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,480
I think that the opposite of being a friend is a mixture of a dream and the concept of work.

528
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,480
In this world, how many people work just to support their families?

529
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,680
How many people can achieve their own ideal after work?

530
00:22:38,680 --> 00:22:40,480
Come on. Drink some water.

531
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:41,480
Thank you.

532
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:43,480
You haven't been relaxing your eyebrows lately.

533
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:45,880
I've been trying to find a way to eat.

534
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:50,080
I've never been so serious about a debate.

535
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:54,480
That's because you want everyone to know that dreams are precious.

536
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:56,080
You're raising me too high.

537
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,080
I just simply don't want to lose.

538
00:23:00,680 --> 00:23:05,280
Although at first, I also thought that this was a huge challenge for you,

539
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,680
and that you might not be able to do it,

540
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,080
but when I saw you so seriously preparing for the competition,

541
00:23:11,080 --> 00:23:13,680
I suddenly realized the meaning of this debate.

542
00:23:13,680 --> 00:23:15,680
During the process of thinking about the debate,

543
00:23:15,680 --> 00:23:19,280
you can clearly understand why you're insisting on your dream.

544
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,480
And you finally have this opportunity

545
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,480
to tell those people who are against your dream the truth.

546
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:30,480
So Shengnan, I support you.

547
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:33,280
This debate is worth a try.

548
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:38,280
Seeing how much you've said, I'm going to write you into my debate.

549
00:23:38,280 --> 00:23:40,080
What do you mean?

550
00:23:41,080 --> 00:23:44,680
Only by having friends like you on the path of insisting on your dream,

551
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:46,080
can I become more brave.

552
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,080
Okay. You said that.

553
00:23:48,080 --> 00:23:49,680
Don't forget to thank me on stage.

554
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:51,080
I'll be listening to you downstairs.

555
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:54,280
Okay. Thank you, my friend.

556
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:12,480
I'm back.

557
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:15,080
Did you leave any food for me?

558
00:24:18,280 --> 00:24:20,480
There are leftovers in the kitchen.

559
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:22,480
You're so stubborn.

560
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,680
Where's Shengnan?

561
00:24:28,680 --> 00:24:31,080
Shengnan is studying in her room.

562
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:34,280
Shengnan is now studying in her room.

563
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:36,680
Shengnan is studying in her room.

564
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,280
Shengnan is studying in her room.

565
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,680
Shengnan is working hard every day.

566
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:43,880
She's studying late every day.

567
00:24:45,480 --> 00:24:47,880
I heard that some kids are always

568
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:50,680
playing games on their computers and not studying.

569
00:24:50,680 --> 00:24:52,680
Did you go in and take a look?

570
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,880
I went and took a look.

571
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:58,280
The child's computer interface is all words.

572
00:24:58,280 --> 00:25:00,280
There's no video game.

573
00:25:00,280 --> 00:25:03,680
Can't you trust the child a little bit?

574
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:10,880
What are you doing?

575
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,880
I'm changing my clothes.

576
00:25:22,280 --> 00:25:24,880
You didn't play games, right?

577
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:27,880
What games? I'm studying.

578
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,280
Get out. Get out.

579
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,880
Shengnan, study hard.

580
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,680
I'll wash some blueberries for you.

581
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:33,680
Okay, mom.

582
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:35,280
Yes. Listen to your mom.

583
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,880
You must study hard.

584
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,080
I said that the child is studying.

585
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,680
You have to say that the child is playing games.

586
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:42,880
You can't be afraid of the child.

587
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,880
I'm studying.

588
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,680
Who knows if the child is playing games or studying?

589
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:50,480
Let's go. Let's go.

590
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,880
Get out. Get out.

591
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,080
Let's see the child study.

592
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,680
I've been busy all day.

593
00:25:54,680 --> 00:25:56,480
I'm going to go.

594
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,080
Shengnan, study hard.

595
00:25:58,080 --> 00:25:59,480
I'll get blueberries for you later.

596
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:01,480
Okay, mom.

597
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:42,680
The autumn cicadas are noisy.

598
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,680
The sun has just turned a blue sunshade.

599
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:49,480
I look around and see your smile.

600
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:52,680
The place we agreed on is so quiet.

601
00:26:52,680 --> 00:26:56,280
The sunset is falling.

602
00:26:56,280 --> 00:27:00,280
Let's feel the starry sky together.

603
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:03,280
Holding hands, smiling.

604
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:05,480
We're thinking about our dreams.

605
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:08,680
Let's go, my friend.

606
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:10,480
You're my friend.

607
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:14,480
Let's fight together and let go.

608
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:17,480
Let's defeat the strongest monster together.

609
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:21,480
Let's make the most beautiful dream together.

610
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:24,680
My friend, my dear friend.

611
00:27:24,680 --> 00:27:28,480
Let's face the dream together.

612
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:31,680
Let's overcome the difficulties together.

613
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,480
Let's be friends forever.

614
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,080
My best friend.

615
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,680
You're my friend.

616
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:42,680
Let's fight together and let go.

617
00:27:42,680 --> 00:27:45,680
Let's defeat the strongest monster together.

618
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Let's make the most beautiful dream together.

619
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:52,880
My friend, my dear friend.

620
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:56,680
Let's face the dream together.

621
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:59,880
Let's overcome the difficulties together.

622
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:05,880
Let's be friends forever.
