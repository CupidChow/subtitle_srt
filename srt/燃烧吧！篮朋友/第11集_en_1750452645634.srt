1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How to sing your dream?

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll draw the sky with the wind

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let everything be the glory in the dark night

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I can't forget the memory

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
So it's a kind of memory

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't be afraid

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen to the sound of the lake and you

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
I'm not afraid of the stars in the water

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The swimming hat becomes a secret

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Protect me and you

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can't forget the memory

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
So it's a kind of memory

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't be afraid

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I can't forget the memory

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
So it's a kind of memory

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't be afraid

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Listen to the sound of the lake and you

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not afraid of the stars in the water

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The swimming hat becomes a secret

24
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Protect me and you

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The End

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Episode 1

27
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,000
It's been a long time.

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The hand-drawn mirror is the best.

29
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:07,000
The hand-drawn mirror is the best.

30
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,000
Yes.

31
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
It's easy to run.

32
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
The hand-drawn mirror.

33
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,000
You've never been there.

34
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:14,000
You've never been there.

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
You're here first.

36
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
What's wrong with you and Zhou Yue?

37
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Did you quarrel?

38
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
No, I didn't.

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
You didn't quarrel?

40
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,000
Usually, you two

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
One is the front-footed one is the back-footed one

42
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Except for the toilet

43
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
When will you break up?

44
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
But Zhou Yue's personality

45
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
shouldn't be

46
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
How can you hurt her?

47
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
Jian, you're free to gossip

48
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
But you give me a good idea.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
I know I was wrong.

50
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
I don't know how to make up for it.

51
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
It's easy.

52
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
If you're wrong,

53
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
you should run away from her.

54
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
Men should have a face.

55
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
If she can't make up for it,

56
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
you should keep your head down.

57
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,000
But she seems to hide from me now.

58
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
I don't know how to find a chance to run away from her.

59
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Who said there's no chance?

60
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
It's about time.

61
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
You can use this opportunity

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,000
to find a way to get her.

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
I'm going to eat.

64
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,000
Wait a minute.

65
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,000
I'll finish this topic later.

66
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Hurry up.

67
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Wenjing,

68
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
let's go to the movie theater together

69
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,000
after two days.

70
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Is there any new movie now?

71
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Love is eternal.

72
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
This movie should be a long time.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
It's still on the movie.

74
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,000
Yuan Dan.

75
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Yuan Dan is eternal.

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Yuan Dan is eternal.

77
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Don't you know?

78
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
I might have something else to do.

79
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Why don't you ask someone else first?

80
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:58,000
No.

81
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
What are you two doing?

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I was going to go to the movie theater,

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
but our captain had an appointment

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,000
and he let us off.

85
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I haven't decided yet.

86
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
How about I go home and watch the movie?

87
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
No, Shengnan.

88
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
What about you?

89
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I don't like to go over the stage.

90
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
I think you don't like to go over the stage.

91
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,000
You want to play with us

92
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
and learn from us.

93
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
That's definitely the case, Dongdong.

94
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
It's boring at school.

95
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Why don't you have any sense of humor?

96
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I heard that

97
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,000
there is a good time

98
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
when the center square is at Yuan Dan.

99
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Shall we go shopping together?

100
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Sure.

101
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
People are fun.

102
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I'll go.

103
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Then, coach,

104
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:43,000
Zhou Yue and Yao Yao.

105
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Okay.

106
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,000
Dongdong, you must go.

107
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
If you don't have time,

108
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
I'll join you.

109
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
What do you mean?

110
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Didn't you say you wouldn't go?

111
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
She doesn't want to go with you.

112
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,000
Hurry up.

113
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Let's have a meal later.

114
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Yao Yao, I heard that

115
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
Yuan Dan is very interesting this year.

116
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Do you want to go shopping?

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Shengnan,

118
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
do you have anything

119
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
that you want?

120
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
I want to be more successful.

121
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Let my dad stop bothering me.

122
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I wanted to ask

123
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
if you have any

124
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
psychological gifts.

125
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Since you say that,

126
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
I'll just send you a meal.

127
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,000
No, no, no.

128
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Yao Yao, I'll just say it casually.

129
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
By the way,

130
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
what kind of gift does a man like?

131
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Think about it, Zhou Yue.

132
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,000
He hasn't been able to breathe yet.

133
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
I want to borrow Yuan Dan's chance

134
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
to buy him a gift.

135
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
I'll give him a apology.

136
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
basketball?

137
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,000
basketball?

138
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
He seems to have bought it last month.

139
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
Then let's do it by hand.

140
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
If we do it by hand,

141
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
it means that he has collected enough.

142
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,000
If we buy more,

143
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
he might repeat it.

144
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Yao Yao,

145
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I cherish the friendship with Zhou Yue.

146
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Sheng Nan,

147
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Zhou Yue is a little upset

148
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
about this matter.

149
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
He's angry.

150
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
You'll forgive him

151
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
when he's angry.

152
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
I was wrong.

153
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
How can I forgive him?

154
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,000
I still want to buy

155
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
a gift.

156
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Sheng Nan,

157
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Zhou Yue doesn't need anything.

158
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
So what's the gift?

159
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
It doesn't matter.

160
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
It's your heart.

161
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Think about it.

162
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
If it's you,

163
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:50,000
what you care about

164
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
is also Zhou Yue's heart.

165
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Yao Yao, I understand.

166
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
Thank you.

167
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,000
I'm leaving.

168
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I'm leaving.

169
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Xiaoyang.

170
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
Where is she?

171
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:46,000
What kind of hand-made gift does a boy like?

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,000
If you want to give a boy a gift,

173
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
you need to know what he likes.

174
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
This way, you can get what you want.

175
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,000
If you have to choose

176
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,000
to make a hand-made gift,

177
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:01,000
you need to have a sense of positioning.

178
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
For example,

179
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,000
chocolate and so on.

180
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
A hand-made gift?

181
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
Then I'll give him

182
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
a hand-made gift.

183
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,000
Yao Yao,

184
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,000
Zhou Yue will definitely

185
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
obey my goodwill.

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
What is the sense of obedience?

187
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I've already decided

188
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,000
to give him a hand-made gift.

189
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
What gift?

190
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,000
I decided

191
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,000
to give him a hand-made gift.

192
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,000
You can give Zhou Yue

193
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
a hand-made gift.

194
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You've known him since he was a kid.

195
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
So,

196
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:57,000
you should know

197
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,000
what color he likes.

198
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
But I'm afraid

199
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
time won't come.

200
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
So I got off the list yesterday.

201
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
I bought

202
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
red, green, yellow, blue,

203
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
and black.

204
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Five colors.

205
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,000
I want...

206
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
Wait a minute.

207
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Can you do it?

208
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
I can. Why can't I?

209
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
How about

210
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:15,000
I give him a color scarf?

211
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
I bought it.

212
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
I can't waste it.

213
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Shengnan,

214
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
this is your first time

215
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
to wear a scarf.

216
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
For you,

217
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:25,000
this difficulty

218
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:27,000
will be a bit too difficult.

219
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,000
How can it be?

220
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
It's just a hand-made gift.

221
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,000
Can't you understand?

222
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Shengnan, what are you doing?

223
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:36,000
I'm chatting with Yao Yao.

224
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,000
I'm leaving, Zhang Wei.

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,000
Right?

226
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,000
It's just a scarf.

227
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,000
I can do it.

228
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
It's not difficult.

229
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,000
It's not difficult.

230
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
But it's not

231
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
that easy.

232
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:51,000
I know.

233
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
It's not difficult.

234
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
I've seen it.

235
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,000
It's just that.

236
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,000
Is it delicious?

237
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
What is this?

238
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:19,000
I don't believe it.

239
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:26,660
Let's그렇

240
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
a harms next time.

241
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
Zhou Si?

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Stop this.

243
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,000
The外婆 is so bold.

244
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
Stop it.

245
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I went to our classroom

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:48,000
to take a shot.

247
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:49,000
The last one.

248
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
Three female classmates are impersonating.

249
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,840
Your students

250
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:56,840
You're starting to take the risk again?

251
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,560
These kids told me

252
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,480
that this is a gift for Yuan Dan.

253
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,960
They put their minds on it.

254
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,520
How can they learn this?

255
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:05,840
I really don't know what they think.

256
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:07,840
I remember when I was little.

257
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:10,040
Did you take the job?

258
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:12,440
I did.

259
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,920
The gift for Yuan Dan

260
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,520
is more important than the entrance.

261
00:11:15,640 --> 00:11:22,280
The

262
00:11:22,280 --> 00:11:25,640
Long-sleeved and long-sleeved high-end

263
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:27,640
and long-sleeved low-end

264
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,480
and long-sleeved high-end

265
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:35,080
Why are you alone?

266
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,280
I don't know where I went.

267
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:38,280
I disappeared right away.

268
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,600
Where did he go?

269
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,760
I don't know.

270
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,560
Did he hide from me on purpose?

271
00:11:44,680 --> 00:11:46,040
How could he?

272
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:47,400
If he really didn't care about you,

273
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:49,480
how could you be so calm now?

274
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:50,880
He's angry.

275
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:52,600
I haven't lost my memory.

276
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:54,080
You're right.

277
00:11:55,080 --> 00:11:56,320
You're right.

278
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:00,800
Am I really right?

279
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:15,560
Cognitive.

280
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:17,480
Urgent cuz I want to

281
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,600
treat you to drinks.

282
00:12:24,200 --> 00:12:25,400
What's with the temperament?

283
00:12:25,960 --> 00:12:27,760
You him.

284
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,920
Not feeling well?

285
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,800
Not feeling any dream.

286
00:12:36,820 --> 00:12:37,840
He doesn't know how

287
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:39,080
to come here again.

288
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:41,320
Lyu Lv.

289
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,200
Menged.

290
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:46,800
тяж한나 regional

291
00:12:49,720 --> 00:12:50,880
You are better than Shengnan?

292
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,920
Being like that

293
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,160
Actually is my fault.

294
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:10,720
I should apologize for my mistake.

295
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,640
You don't need to argue with me so easily,

296
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,080
you can just eat it.

297
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,080
Fine.

298
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:22,160
Make yourself at home.

299
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:38,480
Okay.

300
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:43,240
And then I take a small lift here,

301
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:58,500
and go

302
00:13:58,500 --> 00:14:01,680
and

303
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,740
We-

304
00:14:06,740 --> 00:14:07,680
DD n'tl

305
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:09,240
Let's have it

306
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,200
Then

307
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
I've never seen this book.

308
00:14:12,760 --> 00:14:13,600
Me neither.

309
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,440
I'm not in a hurry to invest.

310
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:18,480
But

311
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,440
I have to invest in this gift.

312
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:22,920
You have to see what others like.

313
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,600
You're so fancy to pick a gift.

314
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:31,520
I'm going to give it to Yao Yao.

315
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,360
Who said I have to give it to Yao Yao?

316
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,680
Who are you going to give it to?

317
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:39,200
To invest in this gift?

318
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:41,840
It'saco.

319
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:43,680
Thanks.

320
00:14:44,920 --> 00:14:45,720
I know.

321
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,640
Yes, you was.

322
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:48,960
Hello?

323
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:55,360
I know.

324
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,000
What do you know?

325
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:03,040
I have to work hard.

326
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:14,520
I'll buy some Valentines Mmmnd

00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:21,680

00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,240
I found

330
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:36,940
Gonna buy

331
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:37,900
what?

332
00:15:37,900 --> 00:15:38,860
Return back to white

333
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,860
I'll go and buy one for him.

334
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:54,860
My dear Shengnan.

335
00:15:57,860 --> 00:15:58,860
No, no, no.

336
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:00,860
This is too soft.

337
00:16:02,860 --> 00:16:06,860
Or Shengnan's character.

338
00:16:09,860 --> 00:16:11,860
This is not good either.

339
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:17,860
Forget it.

340
00:16:17,860 --> 00:16:18,860
Let's save Shengnan.

341
00:16:30,860 --> 00:16:31,860
This is for you.

342
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:35,860
Wow.

343
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:37,860
How do you know I like this?

344
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,860
That day,

345
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:41,860
I was just passing by.

346
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:52,860
Thank you, Yao Yao.

347
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:57,860
But I didn't prepare a gift for you.

348
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:01,860
You gave me a snack.

349
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,860
I haven't finished it yet.

350
00:17:04,860 --> 00:17:05,860
Thank you, Yao Yao.

351
00:17:05,860 --> 00:17:06,860
Happy birthday.

352
00:17:06,860 --> 00:17:07,860
Happy birthday, Yuan.

353
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:08,860
Happy birthday.

354
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,860
This is the hand-made scarf I prepared for you.

355
00:17:26,860 --> 00:17:28,860
Hand-made scarf?

356
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:29,860
You know it?

357
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:34,860
I'm sorry for what happened before, Zuo Yuan.

358
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:35,860
What?

359
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:36,860
I was angry.

360
00:17:37,860 --> 00:17:39,860
I thought you wouldn't give it to me.

361
00:17:42,860 --> 00:17:43,860
I've prepared it.

362
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,860
Thank you, Shengnan.

363
00:17:47,860 --> 00:17:48,860
I'll bring it tomorrow.

364
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:52,860
I'll bring you the scarf.

365
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:55,860
I'll see you at home.

366
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,860
Happy birthday.

367
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,860
Shengnan,

368
00:18:07,860 --> 00:18:08,860
I know you love flowers.

369
00:18:09,860 --> 00:18:12,860
I also admire the way you play the flower basket.

370
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,860
So,

371
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:15,860
I prepared a flower basket for you.

372
00:18:16,860 --> 00:18:19,860
I hope it can accompany you in the competition.

373
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:23,860
To witness your unique and unique friend.

374
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:25,860
Yuan, happy birthday.

375
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:27,860
Zuo Yuan.

376
00:18:34,860 --> 00:18:35,860
Thank you, Zuo Yuan.

377
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,860
I'll bring it tomorrow.

378
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:39,860
I'll see you at home.

379
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,860
Shengnan,

380
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:42,860
thank you for the scarf.

381
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,860
I love it.

382
00:18:53,860 --> 00:18:54,860
Shengnan,

383
00:18:54,860 --> 00:18:55,860
thank you for the scarf.

384
00:18:55,860 --> 00:18:56,860
I love it.

385
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:02,860
Thank you, Mr. Lan.

386
00:19:02,860 --> 00:19:04,860
Zuo Yuan, I love this wine.

387
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,860
Yue.

388
00:19:25,860 --> 00:19:26,860
Mom.

389
00:19:26,860 --> 00:19:28,860
Did you receive the gift yesterday?

390
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:29,860
Yes.

391
00:19:29,860 --> 00:19:30,860
It's so beautiful.

392
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:31,860
Not bad.

393
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,860
Of course not.

394
00:19:32,860 --> 00:19:33,860
It's a hand-made scarf.

395
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:37,860
The girl's hand is good.

396
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,860
Tell me the truth.

397
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:41,860
Did Yao Yao send it?

398
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:44,860
It's not about Yao Yao.

399
00:19:45,860 --> 00:19:46,860
It's not Yao Yao.

400
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:48,860
Who is it?

401
00:19:50,860 --> 00:19:51,860
Shengnan.

402
00:19:53,860 --> 00:19:54,860
Who is Shengnan?

403
00:19:57,860 --> 00:19:58,860
Don't ask.

404
00:19:59,860 --> 00:20:00,860
I'm going to school.

405
00:20:02,860 --> 00:20:03,860
Who is Shengnan?

406
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:06,860
You know?

407
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:18,860
Yao Yao, you know?

408
00:20:18,860 --> 00:20:20,860
Shengnan sent me this scarf.

409
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:24,860
It's pretty.

410
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,860
Right?

411
00:20:26,860 --> 00:20:27,860
I didn't expect

412
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:28,860
Shengnan's hand is so good.

413
00:20:31,860 --> 00:20:33,860
It's really good.

414
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:34,860
Of course.

415
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,860
It's a hand-made scarf.

416
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:47,860
You also bought this scarf?

417
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,860
Yes.

418
00:20:48,860 --> 00:20:49,860
It's a hand-made scarf.

419
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,860
It's a good job.

420
00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:58,860
What's wrong, Second Sister?

421
00:20:58,860 --> 00:20:59,860
What's wrong, Sect Leader?

422
00:21:02,860 --> 00:21:03,860
You bought it?

423
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:04,860
Yes.

424
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:05,860
The first one is good.

425
00:21:05,860 --> 00:21:06,860
It's 29.9 yuan.

426
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:07,860
It's good.

427
00:21:07,860 --> 00:21:08,860
It's good.

428
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:09,860
Do you like it?

429
00:21:09,860 --> 00:21:11,860
I'll pay you later.

430
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,860
No need.

431
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,860
Is it that funny?

432
00:21:17,860 --> 00:21:18,860
No.

433
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,860
No.

434
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,860
So funny.

435
00:21:21,860 --> 00:21:22,860
What's wrong?

436
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:23,860
What's wrong?

437
00:21:24,860 --> 00:21:25,860
Look at this.

438
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:26,860
Can I not be angry?

439
00:21:26,860 --> 00:21:27,860
You're the same.

440
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:28,860
You're a good brother.

441
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:29,860
Let's play together.

442
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:30,860
You're so naughty.

443
00:21:30,860 --> 00:21:31,860
What's wrong with you?

444
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,860
If you really don't like it,

445
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:35,860
just give it to me.

446
00:21:35,860 --> 00:21:36,860
What do you want?

447
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:38,860
I got this as a proof.

448
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,860
Then,

449
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,860
you can't bear to give it to me.

450
00:21:45,860 --> 00:21:46,860
No.

451
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,860
I got it to fight against him.

452
00:21:50,860 --> 00:21:51,860
Let's go.

453
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,860
Why are you standing here?

454
00:21:53,860 --> 00:21:54,860
Let's go.

455
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,860
Let's go.

456
00:21:55,860 --> 00:21:56,860
What are you doing?

457
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,860
What are you doing?

458
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,860
I'm not your friend.

459
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:00,860
What's wrong with you?

460
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,860
Let me tell you.

461
00:22:03,860 --> 00:22:06,860
The 30 yuan insurance crisis in Shengnan,

462
00:22:06,860 --> 00:22:07,860
the result is...

463
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:08,860
It's not worth it.

464
00:22:08,860 --> 00:22:09,860
It's his own money.

465
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:10,860
It's his own money.

466
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:11,860
The key is...

467
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,860
the same as the whole family.

468
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:15,860
Really?

469
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:24,860
It's a good show.

470
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,860
You're really a good show.

471
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,860
No.

472
00:22:31,860 --> 00:22:32,860
It's really fun.

473
00:22:32,860 --> 00:22:33,860
Don't you think so?

474
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,860
Ya Ya.

475
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:37,860
How can I tell you

476
00:22:37,860 --> 00:22:39,860
that I'm more sincere?

477
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:43,860
Just tell me the truth.

478
00:22:43,860 --> 00:22:46,860
It's really a waste of time.

479
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:50,860
I shouldn't have given it to you.

480
00:22:50,860 --> 00:22:52,860
How could I know that I bought it?

481
00:22:53,860 --> 00:22:55,860
It's okay.

482
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:57,860
Just tell him the truth.

483
00:22:57,860 --> 00:22:58,860
He will understand.

484
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:04,860
Zhou Yue.

485
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:23,860
Shengnan.

486
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,860
I think you should tell Zhou Yue.

487
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,860
Although I didn't buy the scarf,

488
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:30,860
I paid for it.

489
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,860
Please forgive me.

490
00:23:31,860 --> 00:23:32,860
I can't do anything.

491
00:23:32,860 --> 00:23:33,860
Don't talk.

492
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:34,860
I'm tired.

493
00:23:38,860 --> 00:23:40,860
You're so mean.

494
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:56,860
You should use your hand

495
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,860
to push the scarf bigger.

496
00:25:58,860 --> 00:25:59,860
Then you can move the neck.

497
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:00,860
Friends.

498
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:01,860
Try again.

499
00:26:02,860 --> 00:26:03,860
Yes.

500
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,860
Look.

501
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,860
It's longer than just now.

502
00:26:05,860 --> 00:26:06,860
Yes.

503
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:07,860
You can try again.

504
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:08,860
Let's go.

505
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:09,860
Brother Jing.

506
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:10,860
Look at my new ball.

507
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,860
It's good.

508
00:26:13,860 --> 00:26:14,860
It's colorful.

509
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:16,860
It feels...

510
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:17,860
very good.

511
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860
It's very good.

512
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:20,860
It's so beautiful.

513
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:21,860
It's so beautiful.

514
00:26:21,860 --> 00:26:22,860
It's so beautiful.

515
00:26:22,860 --> 00:26:24,860
I think it's nice.

516
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:25,860
Yes.

517
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:27,860
The one who gave it to me has a good taste.

518
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:29,860
It looks like he's a good person.

519
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:30,860
Hey!

520
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,860
Don't dirty him.

521
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:34,860
Wang Zijian, be more gentle.

522
00:26:34,860 --> 00:26:36,860
Be more gentle, Wang Zijian.

523
00:26:36,860 --> 00:26:39,860
The ball was used to hit.

524
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:41,860
You're wearing new clothes today.

525
00:26:41,860 --> 00:26:43,860
It suits you.

526
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:44,860
Of course.

527
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,860
This is my best friend.

528
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:49,860
New ball and new clothes.

529
00:26:49,860 --> 00:26:51,860
Let's have some new tricks.

530
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,860
Come on, I like new things.

531
00:26:53,860 --> 00:26:54,860
Let's go.

532
00:26:54,860 --> 00:26:55,860
Get ready.

533
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,860
The sky is so dark.

534
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:25,860
The train is so small.

535
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,860
The small shops on the street are so noisy.

536
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,860
The sky is so dark.

537
00:27:29,860 --> 00:27:31,860
The brain is so noisy.

538
00:27:31,860 --> 00:27:33,860
The sun is so bright.

539
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,860
I'm so nervous.

540
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,860
I can see your smile.

541
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:39,860
The better place is the better place.

542
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,860
The wind is so strong.

543
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,860
The wind is so strong.

544
00:27:43,860 --> 00:27:45,860
Let's feel the new light together.

545
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,860
The starlight is so bright.

546
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,860
Let's hold hands.

547
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:51,860
Smile.

548
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:53,860
We are like a dream.

549
00:27:53,860 --> 00:27:55,860
Let's start our journey together.

550
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,860
You are my friend.

551
00:27:57,860 --> 00:27:59,860
You are my friend.

552
00:27:59,860 --> 00:28:01,860
Let's fight together.

553
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:03,860
Let's hold hands.

554
00:28:03,860 --> 00:28:05,860
The strongest monster.

555
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:09,860
Let's make the most beautiful dream together.

556
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,860
My friend.

557
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:13,860
My dear friend.

558
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,860
Let's face the dream together.

559
00:28:15,860 --> 00:28:17,860
The farthest is the farthest.

560
00:28:17,860 --> 00:28:19,860
Let's fight together.

561
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,860
Let's make a lifetime together.

562
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,860
You are my friend.

563
00:28:23,860 --> 00:28:25,860
You are my friend.

564
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:27,860
You are my friend.

565
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,860
Let's fight together.

566
00:28:29,860 --> 00:28:31,860
Let's hold hands.

567
00:28:31,860 --> 00:28:33,860
The strongest monster.

568
00:28:33,860 --> 00:28:37,860
Let's make the most beautiful dream together.

569
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:39,860
My friend.

570
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,860
My dear friend.

571
00:28:41,860 --> 00:28:45,860
Let's face the dream together.

572
00:28:45,860 --> 00:28:47,860
Let's fight together.

573
00:28:47,860 --> 00:28:49,860
Let's make a lifetime together.

574
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:53,860
