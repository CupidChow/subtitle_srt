00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How to sing your dream?

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll draw the sky with my own hands

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Let everything be the glory in the dark night

4
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How to forget the memory

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It turns out to be a kind of encounter

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't be afraid

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen to the sound of your tiger and your wolf

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Don't be afraid

11
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Listen to the sound of your tiger and your wolf

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,000
Don't be afraid

It turns out to be a kind of encounter

16
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Don't be afraid

17
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

18
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,000
How to forget the memory

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It turns out to be a kind of encounter

20
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't be afraid

21
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

22
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000

It turns out to be a kind of encounter

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't be afraid

25
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Listen to the sound of your tiger and your wolf

26
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't be afraid

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

28
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
I'm not afraid

29
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:58,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

30
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
I'm not afraid

31
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

32
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,000
How to forget the memory

33
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,000
It turns out to be a kind of encounter

34
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Don't be afraid

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

36
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
How to forget the memory

37
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,000
You failed

38
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
I will follow the agreement

39
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
I won't come again

40
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
It's okay, Shengnan

41
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Even if you can't enter the Hualan team

42
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I will always practice with you

43
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Even if we practice alone, we can practice slowly

44
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It will be better slowly

45
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
Zhou Yue, Lin Shengnan

46
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
You can rest assured

47
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
I won't come again

48
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I said I would do it

49
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Okay, from tomorrow on

50
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Don't let us see you again

51
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Ah Jie, you are too old

52
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Shengnan has been working hard for this period of time

53
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
You use this attitude

54
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Be careful not to sit down

55
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
Shengnan, you are too old

56
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
Shengnan, you are too old

57
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
Shengnan, you are too old

58
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Shengnan, you are too old

59
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
Shengnan, you are too old

60
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Shengnan, don't pretend to be old

61
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Shengnan, you are too old

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
Shengnan's fun

63
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
Shengnan, you are too old

64
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You are too old

65
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
Shengnan, you are too old

66
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Shengnan, you are too old

67
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
Shengnan, you are too old

68
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Shengnan, you are too old

69
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Shengnan, you are too old

70
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Shengnan, you are too old

71
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
Shengnan, your hand is too old

72
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
Shengnan, your hand is too old

73
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:04,000
No, you don't have to pity me.

74
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I didn't do the moves I just did.

75
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
I know.

76
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
I haven't taught you the secret of the truth.

77
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
How could you succeed?

78
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You were fooling me at the beginning.

79
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
No.

80
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you succeed, I will make it.

81
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
I will let you join our team.

82
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
It's a pity that you didn't.

83
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,000
You said we can practice together.

84
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,000
Because I believe you.

85
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
Believe me?

86
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I believe you are different from those who are curious

87
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:40,000
and stupid to learn how to play the ball.

88
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
You didn't pass the exam,

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
but you touched me with your love for the ball.

90
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
You are even more popular than many boys.

91
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,000
So I decided to take you as my disciple

92
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
and train with us.

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Jian, you finally figured it out.

94
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,000
You are the one who should be rewarded.

95
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
I will follow the rules.

96
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:06,000
After all, I am the one who should be rewarded.

97
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
You failed this time.

98
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
You can't join our team.

99
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
But I am sure to train with you.

100
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,000
Why are you so stubborn?

101
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Jian, thank you.

102
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
No matter if you can join the team,

103
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,000
you have already agreed to train with them.

104
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
I am very grateful.

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Don't worry. I will cherish this opportunity.

106
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Jian, you are here.

107
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Yes, I didn't expect it.

108
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
You should play the ball first.

109
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Then let the ball pass the ball.

110
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,000
Then you can turn the ball to the inside.

111
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
Then you can catch the ball to the inside.

112
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
It's so interesting.

113
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Forget it.

114
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Look at the fixed time.

115
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:03,000
It's a skill to be on the top and bottom.

116
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Once you are on the top,

117
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
you don't need to write the textbook.

118
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:10,000
It's not your homework to write your textbook.

119
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
Why are you so afraid?

120
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Come on.

121
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
It's not enough to write the textbook.

122
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
The most important thing is to understand.

123
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Did you know what I just told you?

124
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
If you don't know, I will tell you again.

125
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
I heard it, Yangyang.

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
I will write the textbook.

127
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
My colored water bottle.

128
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
It's so boring.

129
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
It hides my hand and skin.

130
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
It hides my water bottle.

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,000
Just kidding.

132
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
It's so fun.

133
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
You are so good at learning.

134
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
You should try to find the right way.

135
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,000
Don't know it.

136
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:50,000
The next goal I will test is to surpass you.

137
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,000
Fine.

138
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,000
If you can surpass me, I will teach you.

139
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Fine.

140
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You are so smart.

141
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
You are a man of the world.

142
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
You should treat them well.

143
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
Fine.

144
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
If you can't pass me the test,

145
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I will teach you to train the wind and wind leg

146
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
when I practice the flower and basketball next time.

147
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
Deal.

148
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

149
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

150
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

152
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:27,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

153
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

154
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:31,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

155
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

156
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

157
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:37,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

158
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

159
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

160
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:43,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

161
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,000
I will teach you to practice the wind and wind leg.

162
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,000
I will teach you to practice the wind leg.

163
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
I will teach you to practice the wind leg.

164
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
稚草

165
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:53,000
You can protect the ground where the wind blade is looking at

166
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
with the part of the skin on your body.

167
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
I will take cover past you.

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:55,960
Let's believe in this.

169
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,080
Okay.

170
00:07:57,080 --> 00:07:58,240
I have a plan.

171
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Let's do preparations on our trip.

172
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:10,440
organic

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,140
A Wizards diamond

174
00:08:12,660 --> 00:08:13,100
Jubiner

175
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:14,960
generates the 100 walking medium

176
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:15,760
Who?

177
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,720
Okay, come here.

178
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:23,520
What did you choose after the game?

179
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,120
Who?

180
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:26,200
I choose...

181
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:29,440
C.

182
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:30,240
I'm in the wrong team.

183
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,040
You've finished the exam.

184
00:08:32,040 --> 00:08:34,440
Can you let me have a rest?

185
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:37,160
What did you choose?

186
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:37,440
Thank you.

187
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:38,320
Did you choose the wrong team?

188
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,160
I'm so annoyed.

189
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,760
What's the arrangement?

190
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,200
Han Jia Yu is not a summer vacation.

191
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,480
He can use any arrangement.

192
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,360
It's just half a year.

193
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:52,280
Brother Han Yue,

194
00:08:52,280 --> 00:08:53,560
do you have any idea?

195
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:56,000
How about

196
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,320
Xiaonian Ye come to my house to play with friends?

197
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,680
I think it's okay.

198
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:00,720
I'll do it.

199
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:01,480
I'll do it, too.

200
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:03,520
I'll do it, too.

201
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,800
Why can't Wang You Xi come to me?

202
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:05,720
What's wrong?

203
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:06,760
Where are you going?

204
00:09:06,760 --> 00:09:08,200
Wang You Xi, are you going?

205
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,280
I'm going to the play.

206
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,480
We...

207
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,440
Let's go together.

208
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,560
Okay.

209
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,320
Let's go together.

210
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,520
People are all excited.

211
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,560
I'm not going.

212
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:16,520
I don't like playing games.

213
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:22,000
Are you afraid that

214
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,040
you can't compare to Yao Yao after the game?

215
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:24,000
That's why you don't dare to come?

216
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:29,240
Who said I don't dare?

217
00:09:29,240 --> 00:09:29,880
I'm going.

218
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,360
Come on.

219
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:44,120
Zhou Yue,

220
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,440
you're so big.

221
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,600
I heard that you have such a big belly.

222
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,680
You're so big.

223
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,520
Hello.

224
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,360
Uncle Yue.

225
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,520
Hello, Yao Yao.

226
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,760
Hello, uncle.

227
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,000
I'm Ruzong Dong.

228
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,640
I'm done.

229
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,320
Hello, Dong Dong.

230
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:02,920
How are you?

231
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,920
I'm very happy to see you.

232
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:05,440
Hello, uncle.

233
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,280
Hello.

234
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:07,680
You're Shengnan, right?

235
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:09,120
I often invite you to my house.

236
00:10:10,120 --> 00:10:10,560
Hello, uncle.

237
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,320
My name is Zhang Lei.

238
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,120
Hello.

239
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,200
My name is Zhuang Wen Jing.

240
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,720
Hello.

241
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,560
Hello, uncle.

242
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:15,360
My name is Jiaxin.

243
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,320
Hello.

244
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:17,400
Yue,

245
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,480
take care of my friends.

246
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:19,280
You guys play first.

247
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:20,120
We'll have dinner later.

248
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:20,800
Come in.

249
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:22,040
Come on.

250
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,080
Let's take you to the restaurant.

251
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:26,360
Come.

252
00:10:26,760 --> 00:10:28,320
Let's take a look at my study.

253
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,320
So many awards.

254
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,320
These are all from my hometown, Lao Zhou.

255
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,200
Uncle used to get a bag of ginseng.

256
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:39,920
How come?

257
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,160
That's right.

258
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,440
Lao Zhou used to have two pairs of gloves.

259
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,440
Before.

260
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,720
Lao Zhou used to be a soldier.

261
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:48,160
He was a soldier in the army.

262
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:49,600
But he changed his job.

263
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:50,840
Why?

264
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,480
Uncle was injured in the army before.

265
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:55,200
He had to retire.

266
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,840
After he returned to the local army,

267
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:59,440
he did some cultural books in the police station.

268
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,480
What a pity.

269
00:11:02,560 --> 00:11:04,680
But I'm so proud of him.

270
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:06,360
There's a saying.

271
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:08,400
The father and the son are always together.

272
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:09,320
Yes.

273
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:10,680
He's really good.

274
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:11,440
He's so good.

275
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,600
But Zhou Yue,

276
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,200
your family is so good.

277
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,880
If I were in my family,

278
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,040
I'd call my dad like that.

279
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,600
He'd probably give me a head shot.

280
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,760
I've been shouting like this since I was a kid.

281
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,040
Lao Zhou is so sweet.

282
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,040
He's a brother.

283
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:27,760
You've never tried it.

284
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:28,760
How do you know?

285
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,800
Really?

286
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,800
How about trying it?

287
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,000
I'll try it next time.

288
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:42,360
Let's go.

289
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,320
Let's take you to other places.

290
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,280
Okay. Let's go.

291
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:45,120
Let's go.

292
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:45,760
Let's go.

293
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:48,160
Let's go.

294
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:58,040
Zhou Yue,

295
00:11:58,040 --> 00:11:59,960
your dishes are so good.

296
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:00,920
They are.

297
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:02,960
Guys,

298
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:03,720
I suggest

299
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:05,480
you to finish your food.

300
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:06,080
Okay.

301
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,200
Okay.

302
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,480
How's it going?

303
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,200
Have some fruit and fruit.

304
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,640
Okay. Thank you.

305
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:12,520
Uncle,

306
00:12:12,520 --> 00:12:14,480
we'll play a game together later.

307
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,280
You guys play.

308
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:16,160
You should cut something.

309
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,560
We'll play together.

310
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:17,960
Let's play together.

311
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:18,920
Just a moment.

312
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,040
I'll show you.

313
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:20,960
Come on.

314
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:21,480
Okay.

315
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,040
Let's go.

316
00:12:22,040 --> 00:12:22,920
Okay.

317
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,760
Come on.

318
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:24,840
Let's play together.

319
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:25,840
Let's go.

320
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:34,520
You're so fast.

321
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:35,760
Right away.

322
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:37,640
No one is looking at you.

323
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,440
You're so far away.

324
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:39,400
Hurry up.

325
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,280
I'm not good at playing.

326
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,320
I'm good at drawing.

327
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:45,560
I'm good at drawing.

328
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:50,120
There's a sale in the supermarket.

329
00:12:50,120 --> 00:12:52,320
There's a school store.

330
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:57,640
There are many brands.

331
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,200
Uncle,

332
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:02,160
please describe the words on the table.

333
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,000
This thing

334
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,520
is long strip.

335
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,600
Long square.

336
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:09,760
Long square.

337
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:11,640
Okay.

338
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:12,400
The first round is over.

339
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:13,600
Let's start voting.

340
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:14,640
I said three, two, one.

341
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:15,320
You guys are

342
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:16,560
the people in the bottom of the box.

343
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:17,280
Okay?

344
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:22,240
Come on. Three, two, one.

345
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:22,960
Go.

346
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:29,000
The first round.

347
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,120
The third round is out.

348
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:31,360
Go. Go. Go.

349
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,000
Go there.

350
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:32,760
The audience is used to it.

351
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:33,960
Go. Go. Go.

352
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:34,600
Go. Go.

353
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:35,600
You want to play with me?

354
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,880
The people are wrong.

355
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,760
The game continues.

356
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:40,440
No. 1.

357
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,960
The packaging is

358
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:46,280
usually purple and pink.

359
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,040
I've seen blue before.

360
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:57,520
The packaging is white.

361
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:00,480
It

362
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,360
will be purple

363
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,600
before and after it's used.

364
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,040
It's not used.

365
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:10,040
It's now used.

366
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,240
This thing

367
00:14:11,240 --> 00:14:12,400
is long strip.

368
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,320
Long strip.

369
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:16,080
Okay.

370
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,160
The second round is over.

371
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:18,560
Come on. Three, two, one.

372
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:18,960
Go.

373
00:14:21,280 --> 00:14:22,800
The second round is...

374
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:23,520
Come on.

375
00:14:23,520 --> 00:14:24,320
The audience is used to it.

376
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Go. Go. Go.

377
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,880
Go. Go. Go. Go.

378
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:29,560
The game continues.

379
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,800
It should have

380
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,560
different size.

381
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:33,880
It should be

382
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:35,800
a person who is on the table.

383
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:39,360
In a certain specific situation,

384
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,560
people will use black plastic bags

385
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,160
to put it in the box.

386
00:14:44,080 --> 00:14:45,400
Many times,

387
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:48,240
people will put it in the box.

388
00:14:49,320 --> 00:14:51,800
This thing is used to stick it.

389
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:52,960
Okay.

390
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:54,640
Stick it.

391
00:14:55,200 --> 00:14:55,880
Okay.

392
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,960
The third person is worth it.

393
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:01,320
The ticket.

394
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,080
Let me explain.

395
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,560
It's the number one and the second.

396
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:04,680
You two continue to speak.

397
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:06,000
The rest of you

398
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:07,040
can only vote for them.

399
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:07,440
Okay?

400
00:15:07,440 --> 00:15:08,440
The number one is to speak.

401
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,200
I got it.

402
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:15,080
This thing

403
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,280
is too young to use.

404
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:17,800
According to you,

405
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,320
it's too old to use.

406
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,200
You are playing water.

407
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:22,680
How can I see

408
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,320
you two

409
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,440
like a group of people?

410
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,040
Playing water.

411
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,280
He is learning.

412
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:26,840
Okay.

413
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:28,280
Three, two, one.

414
00:15:28,280 --> 00:15:28,720
Go.

415
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,000
Okay.

416
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:31,800
The score.

417
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:32,120
Come on.

418
00:15:32,120 --> 00:15:32,760
The last digit.

419
00:15:32,760 --> 00:15:34,200
The number one is to speak.

420
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,000
Let me explain.

421
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,360
This is the last digit.

422
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:38,360
If the object is still on the field,

423
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:39,760
it is the object's victory.

424
00:15:39,760 --> 00:15:41,640
So please vote for it.

425
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:42,200
Come on.

426
00:15:42,200 --> 00:15:42,960
The last digit.

427
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:43,800
The number one is to speak.

428
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,680
According to my limited knowledge,

429
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:49,440
this thing

430
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:50,600
is used every month.

431
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,840
Only girls can use it.

432
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,120
You have to choose the one who is透气.

433
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:01,040
This thing

434
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,240
is related to blood.

435
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,720
It's used when there is blood.

436
00:16:05,240 --> 00:16:06,320
Zhou, you...

437
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:07,520
Say it.

438
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:09,320
You said it too directly.

439
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:12,040
Come on.

440
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,200
Let's hurry up and vote.

441
00:16:13,200 --> 00:16:13,480
Come on.

442
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,720
Three, two, one.

443
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,120
Vote.

444
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:15,360
Vote.

445
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,040
Okay.

446
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,040
I will announce

447
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,120
the game is over.

448
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,480
The object is on the field.

449
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:26,360
Who is the object?

450
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,360
Who is the object?

451
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:27,600
Who is the object?

452
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:28,000
Who is the object?

453
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:28,920
It must be the same.

454
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:29,720
It's Yao Yao.

455
00:16:29,720 --> 00:16:30,400
Yao Yao is the object.

456
00:16:30,400 --> 00:16:31,320
You voted wrongly.

457
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:32,840
Uncle, it's not me.

458
00:16:33,400 --> 00:16:34,280
It's not me.

459
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,080
Yao Yao, you...

460
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,120
It's not me.

461
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,080
Uncle, you are the object.

462
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:38,920
You are the object.

463
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:39,640
I am the object.

464
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:40,680
I don't suspect

465
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:41,880
it's uncle.

466
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:43,720
Dad, what is it?

467
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:45,680
It's me.

468
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:48,640
No.

469
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:49,560
What are you?

470
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:49,840
Come on.

471
00:16:49,840 --> 00:16:50,320
Let me see.

472
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:55,200
Sorry, uncle.

473
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,960
Sorry.

474
00:16:57,080 --> 00:16:57,440
Sorry.

475
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:58,160
Sorry.

476
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:58,800
Sorry.

477
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:00,800
You kids

478
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,480
are living in a new era.

479
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:03,560
They are living in a new era.

480
00:17:03,560 --> 00:17:04,400
Uncle, you are so old.

481
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,800
You can't catch up with them.

482
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,400
But you can

483
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,720
take this question out

484
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:09,960
and say that you are very happy.

485
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,640
Yes.

486
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:12,440
But this girl

487
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,280
is not easy to deal with.

488
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,640
You boys

489
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:16,760
can't take this

490
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:17,600
to make fun of girls.

491
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:18,440
Do you know?

492
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,360
Yes.

493
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:20,560
It's my fault.

494
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,520
It's my fault.

495
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:23,960
Uncle Zhou, you are so kind.

496
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,920
If my dad is like you,

497
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,160
that would be great.

498
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:28,920
Uncle.

499
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:30,720
I want to have

500
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,280
a dad like you.

501
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:33,000
No.

502
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:34,280
I am the one.

503
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:34,960
You can be mine.

504
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:35,920
It's our fault.

505
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,360
It's our fault.

506
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,320
It's our fault.

507
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:39,200
You guys are so mean.

508
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:40,320
It's my fault.

509
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,080
Yes.

510
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:42,080
You are so mean.

511
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:42,680
No.

512
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,120
Come on, uncle.

513
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:43,920
I will massage you.

514
00:17:54,920 --> 00:17:55,320
Bye.

515
00:17:55,320 --> 00:17:56,280
Bye.

516
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,520
Be careful.

517
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:01,440
Be careful.

518
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,240
Bye.

519
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:05,440
Uncle Zhou,

520
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,600
I am used to it.

521
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:07,560
Have a rest.

522
00:18:07,560 --> 00:18:08,200
Okay.

523
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:08,880
I will leave it to you.

524
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:11,520
Yue.

525
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,600
Shengnan is interesting.

526
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:14,680
Yes.

527
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,880
If I didn't stop him,

528
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,120
he would recognize you as his dad.

529
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,680
He is not good

530
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,480
with his dad.

531
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:21,320
Really?

532
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,000
You have to be with him more.

533
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:23,440
This girl

534
00:18:23,440 --> 00:18:24,920
should be very careful.

535
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:26,080
I will be there soon, uncle Zhou.

536
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,640
Mom and dad, I am back.

537
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:38,920
Nannan is back.

538
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:40,640
Are you hungry?

539
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,920
Do you want to eat something?

540
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:42,840
I am not hungry.

541
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:44,240
I am full today.

542
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,320
What did you eat?

543
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:47,480
Mom, I ate

544
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:48,520
sweet and sour ribs,

545
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,600
green bean curd fish,

546
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:52,240
garlic and vermicelli,

547
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:53,240
red-braised pork,

548
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:54,200
duck soup,

549
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,120
crab meat,

550
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,360
and a big dragon.

551
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:59,360
You have a feast today?

552
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:00,800
They are so rich.

553
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,360
I didn't go to the hotel.

554
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:04,080
I did it alone last month.

555
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:05,240
He is amazing.

556
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:07,240
He is a soldier.

557
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:08,840
He is good at making food.

558
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,120
He can do housework

559
00:19:10,120 --> 00:19:11,640
and play games with us.

560
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,560
Most importantly,

561
00:19:13,560 --> 00:19:15,000
he can understand

562
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,480
what our children think.

563
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:21,640
He is good.

564
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:24,520
That's because

565
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,360
he is good at listening to our children.

566
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:27,680
Yes.

567
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:29,560
Zhou Yue is more sensible

568
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,440
and knows how to do housework.

569
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,840
I should learn from him.

570
00:19:32,640 --> 00:19:33,640
Nannan,

571
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,480
I hope you can grow up

572
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,280
and be happy.

573
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,360
I am very happy.

574
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:40,960
I don't need you to do housework.

575
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,920
Zhou is so dangerous

576
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:46,960
and like a brother.

577
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:48,640
You have never tried it.

578
00:19:48,640 --> 00:19:49,560
How do you know?

579
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,360
Old Lin.

580
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,240
Old Lin.

581
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:57,400
The child is calling you.

582
00:19:58,800 --> 00:19:59,920
What is it called?

583
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:00,920
It's not big or small.

584
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:02,640
The child is so good.

585
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,560
It's not necessary to teach him.

586
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,000
Don't be so stubborn.

587
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:06,600
Mom, forget it.

588
00:20:06,600 --> 00:20:07,960
I am going back to my room.

589
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,520
Okay, take a rest.

590
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:15,840
What did he call me just now?

591
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,840
Didn't I perform for you 150and 70.

592
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:26,840
Zhou is inside.

593
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:27,920
What?

594
00:20:27,920 --> 00:20:29,040
He can find it?

595
00:20:29,040 --> 00:20:30,140
I'm left here 10 minutes late

596
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:32,960
Okay.

597
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:33,560
Answer me,

598
00:20:33,560 --> 00:20:34,800
when I go to the group show podcast,

599
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,220
we should

600
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,720
truly let you see

601
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:36,640
the way the coach is singing the song.

602
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:38,900
OK, Mom,

603
00:20:38,900 --> 00:20:40,000
The Daddy otherwise

604
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,720
there will be great interior music.

605
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,320
If you can't win this game,

606
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:51,520
you can't win the 1st Street Cup.

607
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,520
Their efforts are a great help to us.

608
00:20:54,520 --> 00:20:57,920
And I think they really like Hualan.

609
00:20:57,920 --> 00:20:59,320
They have a talent.

610
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:01,720
So I think...

611
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:03,920
I want to give them a chance to prove their friendship.

612
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,320
We don't have any chance.

613
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,520
Boss, we've already treated them as family.

614
00:21:07,520 --> 00:21:09,720
We're very familiar with our family, right?

615
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:14,120
Then we'll give Zhou Yue and Shengnan a chance to prove their friendship.

616
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:14,720
Prove it!

617
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,120
Okay.

618
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:18,320
Thank you, Jiange.

619
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,720
We'll work hard to train to follow everyone's steps.

620
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:21,720
Thank you, Jiange.

621
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:22,720
I'll cheer for Yao Da.

622
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:23,720
Welcome!

623
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:24,720
Welcome!

624
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,720
Yao Wei!

625
00:21:25,720 --> 00:21:26,720
Welcome!

626
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:28,720
We're the trainees.

627
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,720
The more we train, the more we'll be able to grow!

628
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:32,720
Okay!

629
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:44,320
You're the one who gave this to Yao Yao.

630
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,320
It's a chocolate.

631
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:46,320
And...

632
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:48,320
What's on your mind?

633
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:50,320
I wish you the best.

634
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:54,320
What's on my mind?

635
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:57,320
Besides, I really don't know what she likes to eat.

636
00:21:57,320 --> 00:21:59,320
Then you can ask me before you give it to me.

637
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,720
Mom, I'm so poor.

638
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:04,920
Don't worry.

639
00:22:04,920 --> 00:22:06,120
It's not expensive.

640
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:08,720
It's definitely cheaper than this chocolate.

641
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,720
Double-edged snow crab and ice cream.

642
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,720
How is it?

643
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:17,720
Then I'll give you two chicken wings with a glass of warm water.

644
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:20,720
Really?

645
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:22,720
So she wants to eat it?

646
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:24,720
It's not good.

647
00:22:24,720 --> 00:22:25,720
It's not good.

648
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:26,720
It's not good.

649
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:27,720
It's not good.

650
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,720
It's not good.

651
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:29,720
It's not good.

652
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,720
It's not good.

653
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:35,720
Really?

654
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:37,720
It's not good.

655
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,720
I've been a big-headed person since I was a kid.

656
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:42,720
But, bro,

657
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:44,720
I have to remind you.

658
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,720
No one can dig a hole in the Pacific Ocean.

659
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:51,720
Think about it.

660
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:53,720
Go back to the same world.

661
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:54,720
Who said I was a big-headed person?

662
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,720
I'm still a little bit rich.

663
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,720
I'm rich.

664
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,720
I'm a little bit rich.

665
00:22:58,720 --> 00:22:59,720
I'm going to...

666
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:01,720
I'm going to give it to you.

667
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:02,720
I'm going to give it to you.

668
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:03,720
I'm going to give it to you.

669
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
When you come back today,

670
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:13,720
I'm going to give you an order to drop your bag.

671
00:23:17,720 --> 00:23:18,720
premier

672
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,720
iş

673
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:26,200
The younger brother comes and tries to open a garden for the previous month.

674
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:29,980
He is tired and he is not willing to eat something.

675
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:35,080
Yes

676
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,520
He was here until like four years ago.

677
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:42,600
He just takes up the clothes just to play.

678
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:45,440
He was in all those clothes at twelve years.

679
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:50,380
He loves it

680
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:52,280
It's so粗

681
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:22,720
I'll see.

682
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,720
What kind of trick is this?

683
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:33,720
I'll see.

684
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,720
Who sent these?

685
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:40,720
These days, besides these snacks,

686
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,720
there's nothing else.

687
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:43,720
Wait a minute.

688
00:24:43,720 --> 00:24:46,720
Who can send these things?

689
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,720
I probably know who it is.

690
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,720
I'm sorry.

691
00:24:56,720 --> 00:24:58,720
I'm sorry.

692
00:24:58,720 --> 00:25:01,720
I can't waste it.

693
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:04,720
I'll take it to the chef.

694
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,720
I'll go.

695
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:16,720
Why am I so stupid?

696
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:19,720
Forget it, bro.

697
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,720
I know Yao Yao too well.

698
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,720
She's not interested in dating.

699
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,720
I know.

700
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:26,720
Then you can send it.

701
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,720
If you keep sending it, there won't be any result.

702
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:32,720
I know what you mean.

703
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:35,720
Isn't this the first time I like someone?

704
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,720
I'm not good at it.

705
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:42,720
Bro, have you ever thought about it?

706
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,720
Sometimes you think it's good for her.

707
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:46,720
But it's just a wish.

708
00:25:49,720 --> 00:25:50,720
Okay, bro.

709
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,720
I know what you mean.

710
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,720
I know she's a kind person.

711
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:56,720
I'll send her snacks to her.

712
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,720
I won't send them to you.

713
00:26:00,720 --> 00:26:02,720
You're both my friends.

714
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
I don't want her to be troubled.

715
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:06,720
You don't want to be hurt, do you?

716
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:09,720
I'm fine.

717
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:11,720
You don't care.

718
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,720
I'm a big man.

719
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,720
You don't care about me.

720
00:26:15,720 --> 00:26:17,720
Okay.

721
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,720
I'm a big man.

722
00:26:43,720 --> 00:26:45,720
I don't care about you.

723
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:47,720
I'm a big man.

724
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,720
You don't care about me.

725
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,720
I'm a big man.

726
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:53,720
You don't care about me.

727
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:55,720
I'm a big man.

728
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
You don't care about me.

729
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
I'm a big man.

730
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,720
You don't care about me.

731
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:03,720
I'm a big man.

732
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,720
You don't care about me.

733
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,720
I'm a big man.

734
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:09,720
You don't care about me.

735
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:12,720
Take care.

736
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:43,720
We will be friends for the rest of our lives

737
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:46,720
My friend, my friend

738
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,720
Let's fight and let go together

739
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:53,720
Let's fight together, the strongest monster

740
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,720
Let's make the most beautiful dream together

741
00:27:57,720 --> 00:28:00,720
My friend, my beloved friend

742
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:04,720
Let's face the dream together

743
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:07,720
No matter how far, let's cheer together

744
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:13,720
Always be your friend for the rest of our lives
