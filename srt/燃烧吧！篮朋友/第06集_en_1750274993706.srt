1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
What's the point of singing your dream?

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:39,000
I'll draw a beautiful flower to make everything a glory

3
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the dark night

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

5
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
How to forget the cold rain

6
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It turns out to be a kind of rain

7
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't be afraid

8
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen to the sound of the lake and you

9
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't be afraid of the stars in the water

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Come and use the hat to become a secret

11
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Protect me and you

12
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
How to forget the cold rain

14
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It turns out to be a kind of rain

15
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't be afraid

16
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

17
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
How to forget the cold rain

18
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It turns out to be a kind of rain

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't be afraid

20
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Listen to the sound of the lake and you

21
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Don't be afraid of the stars in the water

22
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Come and use the hat to become a secret

23
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Protect me and you

24
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Episode 1

25
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
Thank you, teacher. Goodbye.

26
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,000
Goodbye, teacher. Goodbye.

27
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Be careful.

28
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,000
Teacher Yan.

29
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
This...

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Song Nan's mother.

31
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
Song Nan's grades

32
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
I can see it.

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,000
Dad is a classmate.

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,000
In fact, this grade

35
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,000
In full grade

36
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,000
It's all very reliable.

37
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
I guess the child

38
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Maybe just in high school

39
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Not quite used to the current learning rhythm.

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,000
Actually Song Nan

41
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:46,000
Is a very smart child.

42
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Just

43
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
My son is too heavy.

44
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
You are right.

45
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
I'll talk to him when I get back.

46
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
He will listen to me.

47
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,000
The most important thing now is time.

48
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
Although it's high school

49
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,000
But the time is a little bit.

50
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,000
If the foundation is not good

51
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
To the top three

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I have to spend more time and energy

53
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:12,000
To make up for the past activities.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Yes, yes.

55
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Our Nan Nan

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Although this learning process

57
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
Is a little bit worse.

58
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
But he is very tired.

59
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Is

60
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
We are now

61
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:28,000
He needs a person to supervise him.

62
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
You see, my dad and I

63
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
No dream.

64
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
In this school

65
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
There is no place for help.

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Song Nan's mother

67
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
Don't be anxious.

68
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:41,000
I will definitely

69
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I will definitely study well.

70
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:50,000
Okay.

71
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,000
This half-dried

72
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
Almost

73
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
Mom, my grades

74
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Did you see it?

75
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You're not angry, are you?

76
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Why are you not angry?

77
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:08,000
I'm almost getting angry at myself.

78
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Mom, don't be angry.

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,000
Don't get angry.

80
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You want to scold me.

81
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Just scold me.

82
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm angry.

83
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
I'm angry like this.

84
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Can you be full?

85
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
This can't be blamed for you.

86
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Mom is also responsible.

87
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
I am still a middle-aged person.

88
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Without that ability

89
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
I teach you personally.

90
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
I don't have this money.

91
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I will ask you to teach me.

92
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
Mom is not willing to scold you.

93
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Mom, don't say that.

94
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I don't have enough efforts.

95
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,000
Nan Nan, since you say that.

96
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
This time is not good.

97
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
Because of not enough effort.

98
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
Then mom is not so worried.

99
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:58,000
Because you are not smart enough.

100
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Not learn.

101
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
As long as you work hard.

102
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
You will definitely progress.

103
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
Mom knows you best.

104
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,000
Until you are serious.

105
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Will do your best.

106
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
Even if you fail next time.

107
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,000
Just a little bit better than this time.

108
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
Mom will be very happy.

109
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I know mom.

110
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
I promise I will study hard.

111
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:24,000
I promise next time.

112
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Try to progress a little bit.

113
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
Good boy.

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Nan Nan, since you are now.

115
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Already entered the three Chinese Bridge Middle School.

116
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Let's do our best.

117
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Work hard.

118
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Mom, I will.

119
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
I will study hard.

120
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
But mom, I still want to play basketball.

121
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,000
I don't want to give up.

122
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
Basketball is your favorite thing.

123
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Of course I support you.

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Your dad's side.

125
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,000
Don't worry.

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
I will help you to get over it.

127
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
But Nan Nan.

128
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,000
Now.

129
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,000
To study hard and play basketball.

130
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:08,000
We can't cut the nail and throw it into the watermelon.

131
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,000
Okay.

132
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:12,000
It's late.

133
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,000
Go to sleep.

134
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
I'm going to sleep.

135
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,000
Good night.

136
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Yao Yao.

137
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
You don't have to ask me to eat.

138
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,000
I didn't ask you to help me before.

139
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,000
I am a little unhappy today.

140
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,000
It's a family meeting.

141
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:59,000
But the Golden Flower Blue Team is not in a good mood.

142
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,000
I heard Zhou Yue talk about the Blue Team.

143
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:08,000
Zhou Yue thought it was simple.

144
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
He thought you would be happy.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,000
But he didn't think it was so complicated.

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
But why didn't you happy at the family meeting?

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I am not talking about the wind and cold.

148
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I just think

149
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,000
what's the problem with the family meeting

150
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
and the children at school?

151
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
Yao Yao.

152
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,000
You don't know the atmosphere in my house.

153
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,000
I think I can't accept this.

154
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
Bring him here.

155
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,520
Grandpa, come on.

156
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,000
Put it there.

157
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,720
Uncle.

158
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,000
The chicken soup tastes really good.

159
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
I don't want to.

160
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,000
This is a good chicken.

161
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
It's the perfect chicken for a beautiful woman.

162
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
Sister, you're so thoughtful.

163
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
But I'm pregnant now.

164
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:23,000
I really can't drink too much oil.

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
How about this?

166
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:25,000
Xiao Mei,

167
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,000
I'll clean the oil.

168
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll only leave the soup for you.

169
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
You have to make a good body.

170
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
So you can have a son.

171
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
Drink it.

172
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
You tell your parents

173
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,000
to find you a wife.

174
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:42,000
This child

175
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
has to be pregnant.

176
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Drink it.

177
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
Do you think that

178
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,000
I can have a son

179
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,000
when I'm pregnant?

180
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
But when my sister-in-law is pregnant,

181
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,000
you can't do that.

182
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
When the baby is born,

183
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
you're faster than the delivery.

184
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Whether you're pregnant or not,

185
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
you're not pregnant.

186
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
It's different.

187
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:05,000
Forget it.

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:07,000
If Xiao Mei doesn't like to drink,

189
00:09:07,000 --> 00:09:08,000
she won't drink.

190
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:09,000
Eat.

191
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
Come on.

192
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
Drink.

193
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Drink it.

194
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
You're pregnant.

195
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,000
But our family's single-marriage man.

196
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:21,000
You don't have to make a wife.

197
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,000
My grandson has to make a wife.

198
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
Listen to me.

199
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
Eat.

200
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,000
Dad.

201
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Today is the day of the reunion.

202
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,000
How about this?

203
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
I'll give grandpa

204
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,000
and uncle a bow to you.

205
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
I wish grandpa

206
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,000
a long-lasting love

207
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
and a good marriage.

208
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,000
A long-lasting love and a good marriage.

209
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
And aunt.

210
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
I wish aunt a happy and healthy life.

211
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:01,000
A happy and beautiful life.

212
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
It's a good thing.

213
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,000
Dad,

214
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,000
do you like it?

215
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
I'll give you a brother.

216
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Do you want to

217
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
tell your little brother

218
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
what you want to say to him?

219
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Wulibaha power.

220
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Wulibaha.

221
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
Take it back.

222
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Take it back.

223
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
You bastard.

224
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,000
You dare to kiss my grandson.

225
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
You're still a kid.

226
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
You're being taught.

227
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Don't be angry.

228
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
Dad.

229
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Don't go.

230
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
You dare to kiss my grandson.

231
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
I'll beat you.

232
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
Don't be angry.

233
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I'll beat you.

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Come back.

235
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:32,000
Since then,

236
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
I've been friends with my family.

237
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,000
Except my dad,

238
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,000
Feng Nian,

239
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
I've never been back.

240
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:41,000
I'm sorry, Chenan.

241
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
You've made me think

242
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
about such a unhappy thing.

243
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,000
No.

244
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,000
He doesn't like me.

245
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
I don't like him, either.

246
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
I'm being too modest.

247
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:50,000
But sometimes

248
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,000
I get angry.

249
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:53,000
Why am I a girl?

250
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
Girls are too limited.

251
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
For example,

252
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,000
my dad always takes her as a promise.

253
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Uncle must do it for your own good.

254
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
I know.

255
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,000
My dad is also very hardworking.

256
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,000
When he was young,

257
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:12,000
he worked at the factory.

258
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
He was fired.

259
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Since he has no culture,

260
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,000
he can only drive a taxi.

261
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He's always too dark.

262
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
He's always running around.

263
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
He only earns a few hundred yuan.

264
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
I know he's not easy.

265
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Although I know he's very hardworking,

266
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
I sometimes get angry.

267
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,000
He never listens to my ideas.

268
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
He's afraid that I'll be bullied

269
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
by the culture.

270
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
So he keeps watching me study.

271
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,000
But I think

272
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:39,000
the future of the play will be bright,

273
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,000
right?

274
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:54,000
Come on, Brother Jian.

275
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Eat this.

276
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Brother Jian.

277
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Shengnan really can't stay in the team.

278
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Zhou Yue.

279
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
You've been asking about it all night.

280
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
Your meal is red-banded banquet.

281
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
No, Brother Jian.

282
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
I really want to recommend you a good idea.

283
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,000
You worked hard for your friend.

284
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:13,000
I'm really touched.

285
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But Shengnan can't stay in the team.

286
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:19,000
You're too little-minded.

287
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:22,000
Let's walk the bridge.

288
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Let's see if he can stay in the team.

289
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:24,000
Okay.

290
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,000
You'll definitely lose.

291
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I'm sorry, Senior.

292
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
We just wanted to learn on the road,

293
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,000
not to disturb your training.

294
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:39,000
You wanted to steal the poetry, right?

295
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Absolutely not.

296
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
We just came to have fun.

297
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,000
Yes, Senior.

298
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't mistake us.

299
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,280
We just want to learn from you.

300
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,680
We won't disturb your training.

301
00:12:49,520 --> 00:12:50,960
You want to steal the poems, right?

302
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,200
Absolutely not.

303
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:54,360
We just want to learn from you.

304
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,360
Yes, senior.

305
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,240
Don't get me wrong.

306
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,640
I was just kidding.

307
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:02,920
I saw your performance that day.

308
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:03,920
It was wonderful.

309
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:04,880
I'm Lu Pongda.

310
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:05,960
I'm glad to meet you.

311
00:13:06,640 --> 00:13:07,320
Hello, brother.

312
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,280
After you left that day, we...

313
00:13:10,640 --> 00:13:11,760
Here is your change.

314
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:13,400
Happy birthday!

315
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:14,320
Great!

316
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:28,120
That brat said you're a good girl.

317
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,680
You figured out girls like him simply like that.

318
00:13:30,080 --> 00:13:30,600
That can't be, can it?

319
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:31,160
value.

320
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:31,560
That can't be, can it?

321
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:32,480
That's true.

322
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,320
What make stress on him still?

323
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,000
Actually, besides being another player,

324
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
I'm not sure.

325
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,280
I don't know where I'm on the short board.

326
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,800
So I want to make progress.

327
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,320
I want to join your team

328
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,840
and accept the training of the system.

329
00:13:54,240 --> 00:13:55,320
We haven't

330
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,600
taken the power of the team.

331
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,920
You'd better go back.

332
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,240
Brother Da.

333
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,320
Come on, let's practice.

334
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,320
It seems that you want to join the team

335
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,840
and not only A Jian.

336
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:11,920
It's OK.

337
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:14,800
I won't give up.

338
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,320
I won't give up.

339
00:14:40,760 --> 00:14:41,880
Please...

340
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:42,820
Yes.

341
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:55,600
leader

342
00:15:10,420 --> 00:15:11,420
Duanwan

343
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,720
Of course.

344
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,200
Whether you're in or out of the team,

345
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:15,800
practicing next to you

346
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:17,280
can also learn a lot.

347
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,400
The city flower basketball game is about to start.

348
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:23,680
From tomorrow on,

349
00:15:23,920 --> 00:15:25,400
we'll strengthen our training strength.

350
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:26,640
Yes, sir.

351
00:15:26,840 --> 00:15:27,240
Okay.

352
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:28,160
Let's go.

353
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,880
From tomorrow on,

354
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,120
you two don't come.

355
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:37,440
Why?

356
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:39,240
We're going to prepare for the city game.

357
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,280
You two are not our team.

358
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,080
And our training schedule

359
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,200
will start from tomorrow.

360
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:45,520
You definitely won't be able to follow.

361
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:47,760
I'll prove it to you.

362
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:48,760
I can follow.

363
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,080
Here.

364
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,360
100 bobtik jumps.

365
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:14,840
One of them can't be missing.

366
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,520
Energy training is the basis.

367
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,280
All of us don't want to highlighting.

368
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,640
You can hear me offer?

369
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:20,800
Of course I can.

370
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,080
Of course I can.

371
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:22,720
Xiaotang.

372
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,000
Don't highlight.

373
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,600
You can't do 100 bobtik jumping.

374
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,440
You may fail.

375
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,920
Because I can't.

376
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:28,000
You'll be disreputed.

377
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,900
Chong Let us have a fight

378
00:16:42,980 --> 00:16:44,860
It will be better if you are generous

379
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,560
Your turn

380
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,960
Thank you

381
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,680
I can understand

382
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,720
but

383
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:56,340
the cleanliness among me

384
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:57,640
enough

385
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,480
豁

386
00:16:58,480 --> 00:16:59,700
My colleague

387
00:17:06,260 --> 00:17:07,860
Shan...

388
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:09,900
You come to pick me up

389
00:17:09,900 --> 00:17:10,740
I can.

390
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:11,860
Stop it.

391
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:13,260
He didn't want you to enter.

392
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,580
Lu Pongdan, follow him.

393
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:21,740
I said I can follow him.

394
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:22,700
Hurry up.

395
00:17:23,540 --> 00:17:24,340
I can do it.

396
00:17:31,540 --> 00:17:32,220
Jiangnan,

397
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,620
do you want to rest?

398
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,140
No.

399
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:36,460
It's okay.

400
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:37,500
Go on.

401
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:38,780
He said

402
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,940
he didn't want you to enter.

403
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:40,980
Go on.

404
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:41,820
You will.

405
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:00,060
How is it?

406
00:18:00,060 --> 00:18:00,980
Do you like it?

407
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:03,220
I can.

408
00:18:04,780 --> 00:18:05,460
Shen Nan,

409
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:07,940
your face is white.

410
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,380
I'm fine.

411
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:11,380
Look at you.

412
00:18:11,380 --> 00:18:13,500
Hua Lan is not as hard as you think.

413
00:18:14,300 --> 00:18:15,500
I don't get it.

414
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:17,340
Since the competition is about to start,

415
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,740
why don't we put our time

416
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:20,420
on the big move

417
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:21,940
and waste our time

418
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,340
on the physical ability?

419
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,580
I don't know.

420
00:18:25,260 --> 00:18:26,340
I want to play Hua Lan.

421
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:29,060
In the competition of the top players,

422
00:18:29,740 --> 00:18:31,220
everyone's ability and level

423
00:18:31,420 --> 00:18:32,340
are almost the same.

424
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:34,020
What level can you win?

425
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:35,340
What's more,

426
00:18:35,900 --> 00:18:36,980
it's basic skill.

427
00:18:37,700 --> 00:18:39,420
Especially after the ending pose,

428
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:41,180
whether your body is stable

429
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:42,500
or not,

430
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,820
it's easy

431
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,060
for the judges to feel

432
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:46,180
or it's tiring.

433
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:47,300
This feeling

434
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:48,700
is completely different.

435
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,820
Do you understand?

436
00:18:50,820 --> 00:18:51,860
It's important.

437
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,500
I can practice hard,

438
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,820
but you have to give me a week.

439
00:18:59,060 --> 00:19:00,940
I promise I can follow everyone.

440
00:19:01,660 --> 00:19:03,100
I'll help you.

441
00:19:04,740 --> 00:19:06,220
I don't know where it is.

442
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,980
I admire your bravery.

443
00:19:22,380 --> 00:19:24,340
Have you seen Li JiaQiu?

444
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,060
I saw his performance in video.

445
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:32,940
Anjia, come here.

446
00:19:32,940 --> 00:19:34,940
I'm not a girl.

447
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,940
Don't you want to know?

448
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:38,940
I'm not a girl.

449
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:40,940
I'm just a girl.

450
00:19:40,940 --> 00:19:42,940
How could you say that?

451
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,940
You're a girl.

452
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:46,940
You're a girl.

453
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:50,940
I'm not a girl.

454
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:52,940
I'm not a girl.

455
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:54,940
I'm just a girl.

456
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,940
I'm not a girl.

457
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,940
I'm just a girl.

458
00:19:58,940 --> 00:20:00,460
I'll give you more time.

459
00:20:00,900 --> 00:20:01,500
Okay.

460
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,940
I'll give you one week.

461
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:05,180
One week?

462
00:20:05,580 --> 00:20:07,180
Wang Zijian, you're too much.

463
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:08,980
Let's go.

464
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:09,820
I'm tired.

465
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:10,500
Let's go.

466
00:20:11,860 --> 00:20:12,940
One week is enough.

467
00:20:16,060 --> 00:20:17,020
You're almost there.

468
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,660
100 bar jumps. Go on.

469
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,820
Yes.

470
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,740
Let me Southern singing ...

471
00:21:01,820 --> 00:21:02,740
OK?

472
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:03,860
You want a rest?

473
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:04,860
No need.

474
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,900
Go on.

475
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,620
The top company is open.

476
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:35,040
Boss.

477
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,080
I was bought by the boss.

478
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:38,120
Boss, I'm serious about the organization.

479
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:39,120
It's absolutely important.

480
00:21:39,800 --> 00:21:42,800
But the title you gave me is too difficult.

481
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:44,240
That's called the real home.

482
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,680
It's a famous person.

483
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,120
We are all old friends.

484
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,960
We don't know how to learn.

485
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:50,960
Just give him a week.

486
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:52,400
How ugly is it?

487
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:53,640
It's a bit hard for him.

488
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,320
Did you let me drive him away?

489
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:58,680
Did you?

490
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:01,080
You said he was free to love.

491
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:02,400
Is it you?

492
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:05,040
I didn't know him back then.

493
00:22:05,320 --> 00:22:07,000
I don't know who they are.

494
00:22:07,400 --> 00:22:09,120
But now, as I've been observing,

495
00:22:09,520 --> 00:22:11,320
I think they are really into each other.

496
00:22:13,720 --> 00:22:17,200
They are so close to each other.

497
00:22:18,520 --> 00:22:20,040
They are close.

498
00:22:22,800 --> 00:22:25,200
Boss, I really think they are not bad.

499
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,520
Think about it.

500
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,240
Yu Qian and the others are free to love here.

501
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:30,080
Here,

502
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:32,520
we had another Cheungmu who couldn't live with him.

503
00:22:32,760 --> 00:22:34,360
Why don't we keep it?

504
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:36,080
What?

505
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:37,320
Well- LIVE?

506
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,000
Doed?

507
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:41,440
Have to wait for you.

508
00:22:43,320 --> 00:22:44,440
What's wrong with Tao?

509
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,080
Boss, I'll go there now.

510
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:03,680
I USED ITS WEALT IN Ok

511
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:06,360
OK

512
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,240
Here, let's go

513
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:13,280
2

514
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,280
25

515
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:16,600
See

516
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,920
He composed everything

517
00:23:18,920 --> 00:23:19,400
Jie

518
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,440
You want to work hard

519
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:20,760
trying

520
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:23,360
Why are you so tired

521
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:25,000
Red bean ye

522
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:27,440
What's wrong with you and red bean Bun?

523
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:28,480
I'm not drunk anymore.

524
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:31,000
We are going to train Hualan every night.

525
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:32,360
We have to work early

526
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,400
while we are free.

527
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,760
Hualan?

528
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,200
Is that your friend Hualan?

529
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,280
Awesome.

530
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,560
It's a big and powerful match.

531
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:42,760
It's not a big deal.

532
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:44,520
You haven't joined the team yet?

533
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:46,080
It doesn't matter.

534
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,360
I'm not in the team.

535
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,560
The main thing is that Shengnan

536
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,800
is in the heart of this game.

537
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,280
He always wants to be a professional Hualan player.

538
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,440
He doesn't want to be a member of the team.

539
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:57,880
He is a big fan of the team.

540
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,160
If it weren't for Hualan,

541
00:24:14,680 --> 00:24:16,800
I wouldn't have worked so hard.

542
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,160
I'm not a professional Hualan player.

543
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:30,120

I'm not a professional Hualan player.

I'm not a professional Hualan player.

I'm not a professional Hualan player.

556

I'm not a professional Hualan player.

I'm not a professional Hualan player.

560

I'm not a professional Hualan player.

561
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,240
I'm not a professional Hualan player.

562
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,840
I'm not a professional Hualan player.

563

I'm not a professional Hualan player.

I'm not a professional Hualan player.

569
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:35,120
I'm a pro player.

570
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,200
I'm not a professional Hualan player.

571
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:41,360
Speaking of,

572
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:45,480
There are two Chinese players in our team.

573
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,280
Three Chinese players,

574
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,440
You two play first,

575
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,080
They will come out on the second era of the term.

576
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,320
Friends love each other more than anyone else.

577
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:55,320
I think so.

578
00:25:57,320 --> 00:25:59,320
I think you should come.

579
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:07,320
Are you ready?

580
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,320
You only have one chance.

581
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:13,320
Good luck.

582
00:26:14,320 --> 00:26:16,320
Shengnan, be patient.

583
00:26:24,320 --> 00:26:25,320
Thank you.

584
00:26:29,320 --> 00:26:30,320
Thank you.

585
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,320
You failed.

586
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:58,520
I'll wait for Minister Yuan to take my hand and issue an appointment.

587
00:27:00,280 --> 00:27:01,520
I will not come again.

588
00:27:53,320 --> 00:27:55,320
Let's go together

589
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:58,320
My friend, you are my friend

590
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,320
Let's fight together and let go

591
00:28:02,320 --> 00:28:05,320
Let's fight together, the strongest monster

592
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:09,320
Let's make the most beautiful dream together

593
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,320
My friend, my dear friend

594
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:16,320
Let's face the dream together

595
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:19,320
I'm willing to be together

596
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:23,320
Let's go together, let's be together forever

597
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:27,320
My friend, my friend

598
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,320
Let's fight together and let go

599
00:28:31,320 --> 00:28:34,320
Let's fight together, the strongest monster

600
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:38,320
Let's make the most beautiful dream together

601
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:41,320
My friend, my dear friend

602
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,320
Let's face the dream together

603
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,320
I'm willing to be together

604
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:51,320
Let's face the dream together

605
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:54,320
I'm willing to be together forever

606
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,320
My friend, my dear friend
