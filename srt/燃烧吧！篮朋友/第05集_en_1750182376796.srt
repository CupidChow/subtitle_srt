I will draw the sky with the wind

00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let everything be the glory

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In the dark night, I'm not afraid

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

Don't be afraid

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen to the sound of your tiger and your wolf

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000

00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:11,000
It's good, Dongdong. You can eat enough.

23
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
I eat too much.

24
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:16,000
No, eating is a good thing.

25
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,000
When I was in middle school, there was a time when I was very capable.

26
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I had to eat 20,000 rice every meal.

27
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I had a family member.

28
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,000
I had a height of 20 cm.

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Really?

30
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,000
Yes.

31
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,000
Boss, eat more lamb skewers.

32
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Okay.

33
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,000
I had a height of 20 cm.

34
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,000
I will eat 20,000 rice every meal.

35
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
I will buy more meat.

36
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I will give you that.

37
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,840

38
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000

00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,000
So many goose�!

40
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Please give me that!

41
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:14,000
The chance to eat this because of your way of thinking.

42
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
Why are you so angry with him?

43
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I don't understand.

44
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
Why are you being mad at me?

45
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
I don't know what else he wants.

46
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:30,000
Here, a cup of milk.

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
Thank you, mom.

48
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Your dad is so good at studying.

49
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
He said he would reward you if you get a good result.

50
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Really?

51
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,000
Of course not.

52
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,000
What do you want?

53
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I want to play basketball every day.

54
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,000
Nan Nan, except basketball,

55
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
do you have anything else you want?

56
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,000
I don't know.

57
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I want to play basketball.

58
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
I want to play basketball.

59
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
I want to play basketball.

60
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
I want to play basketball.

61
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
I want to play basketball.

62
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I want to play basketball.

63
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
I want to play basketball.

64
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
I want to play basketball.

65
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
I want to play basketball.

66
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
I want to play basketball.

67
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
I want to play basketball.

68
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
I want to play basketball.

69
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
I want to play basketball.

70
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I want to play basketball.

71
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,000
Yes.

72
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Yes.

73
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,000
Yes.

74
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Yes.

75
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
Yes.

76
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
Nan Nan,

77
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:48,000
look at mom.

78
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,000
What is so delicious?

79
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,520
Are you too tired to eat?

80
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,360
Buy some crabs and change your taste buds.

81
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,800
Mom, I didn't eat your cooking.

82
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:56,960
Mom and dad

83
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,440
are so tired of learning

84
00:05:58,600 --> 00:05:59,560
from you these days.

85
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,240
They are so fast.

86
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,320
They rely on you.

87
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,080
Mom

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,600
can cook something delicious.

89
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,200
I don't know how to treat you.

90
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:08,320
Do you like it?

91
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,560
I like it.

92
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,000
But mom,

93
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,320
I want to tell you something.

94
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,440
What's wrong?

95
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:18,840
Mom, I'm sorry.

96
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,560
I didn't study well these days.

97
00:06:22,920 --> 00:06:24,440
I'm sorry for your help.

98
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Silly girl.

99
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,360
Mom didn't buy crabs for you

100
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,680
because you studied hard.

101
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:31,800
Mom, do you need a reason?

102
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,160
I'm afraid I can't eat enough.

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,080
Thank you, mom.

104
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:38,280
I'm so old.

105
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:40,320
Okay, I'll go to the room.

106
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:40,600
Okay.

107
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,360
You go to study.

108
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:53,340
каждant wash

109
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:55,360
Ask guys to go to class now.

110
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,240
This is the school designer of the two zone,

111
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,880
next one is this.

112
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,300
And the theme is

113
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,960
surrounded at the corner.

114
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:03,760
Why do you want the less?

115
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,160
Okay, I'll change it.

116
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,540
The second step is

117
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,280
to touch-up the most important part.

118
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,200
Look at me.

119
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:15,000
Why in the hall?

120
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:16,880
Yun Shengnan,

121
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:17,880
Don't look at Xiao Chuan.

122
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:19,040
You're always talking about it.

123
00:07:19,200 --> 00:07:20,200
Okay, okay.

124
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,040
Mr. Dong Dong,

125
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,720
I'm going to the toilet.

126
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,640
I'll be right back.

127
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,040
Go back as soon as possible.

128
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:28,800
Okay.

129
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:32,680
Zuo Yun.

130
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,040
Students,

131
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,120
the first place in this exam

132
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:43,480
is Wen Ziyou.

133
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:46,120
And the second is Zhu Dongdong.

134
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,560
We've been producing a single class.

135
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,800
This is a very good grade.

136
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:53,960
At the same time,

137
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,880
I have to inform you that

138
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,680
this Saturday at 7.30 p.m.,

139
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,840
we'll be opening the class.

140
00:08:01,160 --> 00:08:03,520
Remember to remind your parents

141
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,280
to attend the class.

142
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:06,960
Okay, Zuo Yun.

143
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:09,400
See you, teacher.

144
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,920
On the Re twisted I behind,

145
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,320
I have to blab them.

146
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:20,160
I was...

147
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:21,480
Working here alone.

148
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,360
Feel myself콜.

149
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,360
This is the time,

150
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,400
since I'm the class 912 next.

151
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:35,360
Sorry, I had the class 613 last night.

152
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:36,360
Then don't cheat on me.

153
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,320
What can I do for you?

154
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,320
I'm not a good student.

155
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,320
I didn't expect that you didn't look at me.

156
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,320
How should I apologize?

157
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,320
Shengnan.

158
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
Zhou Yu.

159
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,320
I'm sorry.

160
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,320
What's wrong? You didn't take the exam well.

161
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:56,320
Then why did you apologize to me?

162
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,320
I didn't do it well. I'm sorry.

163
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,320
I'm sorry because I was too much

164
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,320
to say to you last time.

165
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,320
So I apologize to you.

166
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:09,320
It's because of this beautiful thing.

167
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,320
I said you were so heartless.

168
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,320
What?

169
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:16,320
I don't even know which word you said.

170
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,320
It's just that you're not good at grades.

171
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm not good at grades. Why should I be?

172
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,320
Actually, we are good friends.

173
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,320
I didn't do anything for you.

174
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:33,320
I hurt you. I'm sorry, Zhou Yu.

175
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,320
Shengnan, you can't do this.

176
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,320
I see. I see. I'm sorry.

177
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:40,320
Look, you apologized again.

178
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,320
Listen to me.

179
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:43,320
I understand that you two are good friends.

180
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,320
I'm afraid that you don't know each other well.

181
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,320
I hurt you.

182
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,320
You said you don't know each other well.

183
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:51,320
But I'm not good enough to you.

184
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,320
We are friends who have experienced great things.

185
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:55,320
We can't be so careful.

186
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:57,320
We can't be so careful.

187
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,320
Otherwise, we'll be so tired.

188
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,320
We have to be more taciturn.

189
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,320
I understand your feelings.

190
00:10:03,320 --> 00:10:05,320
I hope you can understand my feelings.

191
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,320
Okay. I understand.

192
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:09,320
Thank you. I understand.

193
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,320
Then we can't do this anymore.

194
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,320
Okay.

195
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,320
Let's skip this first.

196
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,320
Let's put this aside first.

197
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:20,320
This exam is so long.

198
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,320
I have to think about how to get back alive.

199
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:32,320
Wen Zhiyao, what are you doing?

200
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,320
You look so pretty and you're good at learning.

201
00:10:35,320 --> 00:10:37,320
You have your eyes on your head.

202
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:39,320
You don't know how to put others in your eyes.

203
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:40,320
That's right.

204
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:42,320
You look so good in that dress.

205
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,320
Who are you looking at?

206
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:45,320
You always treat others with love.

207
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,320
You hate it when you see it.

208
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:49,320
We are so good to you.

209
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,320
You are still pretending to be tall.

210
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:53,320
You don't even buy me a birthday present.

211
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:55,320
Do you treat me as a friend?

212
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,320
Friends are not eating together.

213
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,320
They are shopping, taking pictures and posting on social media.

214
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,320
Friends may have many different types of friends.

215
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:12,320
But friends will always understand each other's thoughts.

216
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:14,320
They will think about each other more.

217
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:18,320
Friends are equal in size and respect each other.

218
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:21,320
They are afraid that they are not enough for each other.

219
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,320
They are afraid that they will hurt each other accidentally.

220
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:27,320
You don't understand these things, do you?

221
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,320
You two

222
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:35,320
are selfish and selfish.

223
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:37,320
You make me feel very bad.

224
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:42,320
You say I'm tall and I'm half tall.

225
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,320
I don't care.

226
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
But you two

227
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,320
will never say these words in front of me.

228
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,320
I'm sorry.

229
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm sorry.

230
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:17,320
Mom.

231
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:20,320
My dad is not home today.

232
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,320
You want to see me?

233
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:23,320
Dad,

234
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:26,320
why are you not coming home?

235
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:29,320
Dad.

236
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,320
Are you doing well today?

237
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,320
I think you are in a good mood today.

238
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,320
Is there anything happy?

239
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:43,320
Of course there is.

240
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,320
As long as you study hard,

241
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,320
your dad will be happy and happy.

242
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,320
No, no, no.

243
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,320
Dad, don't be too happy.

244
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,320
No, no.

245
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,320
Dad, don't be too happy.

246
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:55,320
No, no.

247
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:56,320
No, no.

248
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,320
Dad, I'm going back.

249
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:04,320
Did you get the test result today?

250
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,320
The result?

251
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,320
Mom.

252
00:13:09,320 --> 00:13:10,320
By the way,

253
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,320
I'm going to attend the family meeting

254
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:14,320
of your third week in next week.

255
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,320
Family meeting?

256
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,320
Dad, how do you know?

257
00:13:17,320 --> 00:13:18,320
Your class leader

258
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,320
sent me the message.

259
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,320
It's me.

260
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,320
Mom, you think about it.

261
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:28,320
Your dad really went to the family meeting.

262
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,320
It's the first family meeting

263
00:13:29,320 --> 00:13:31,320
in our men's college.

264
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:33,320
We have to be honest with each other.

265
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,320
Dad,

266
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,320
mom,

267
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:39,320
the third family meeting is the final one.

268
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:40,320
The family meeting this time

269
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,320
is not for other families.

270
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:47,320
If so,

271
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:49,320
I'll go to the real one.

272
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,320
Go.

273
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:54,320
Go.

274
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,320
Did you eat spicy pepper?

275
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:25,320
Are you annoying?

276
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:30,320
I think Sheng Liang cares about you.

277
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,320
Why do you say that?

278
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,320
Based on my recent observation,

279
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,320
he cares about the friendship between you two.

280
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,320
I like him too.

281
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,320
I treat him as a good friend.

282
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:45,320
That's why he feels

283
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:47,320
he's making a mistake recently.

284
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,320
What do you mean?

285
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,640
He feels he's done something wrong recently.

286
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,600
Because it's very anxious.

287
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,160
Do you know what's wrong?

288
00:14:56,680 --> 00:14:57,600
I don't know either.

289
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,240
I think

290
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,400
he's afraid of hurting you.

291
00:15:04,640 --> 00:15:07,160
And he always wants to give you something.

292
00:15:07,840 --> 00:15:10,000
So you should treat him better.

293
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:12,880
What should I do?

294
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:16,920
Shengnan has his own dream.

295
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:19,360
So as good friends,

296
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:21,640
you should help him realize his dream.

297
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:28,680
Shengnan,

298
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,360
come out for a game tomorrow.

299
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:47,640
Shengnan,

300
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:52,480
why are you so s**ting?

301
00:15:55,200 --> 00:15:56,440
Article 18.

302
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:00,560
Shengnan.

303
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,160
Does it look good?

304
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,320
It's enough.

305
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,160
How did they get here?

306
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:11,440
I don't know.

307
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,680
I've had my Sept Rs.

308
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,720
decreased for months.

309
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:18,640
Can I sit over here

310
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:22,020
Don't get blind

311
00:16:45,200 --> 00:16:45,920
Sheng Nan

312
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,440
Dad, we have new embodied way.

313
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,960
We are not good at being old at such thing?

314
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,000
God ask the cause to justify this.

315
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,640
It's not like the time after our family's blue blood is passed,

316
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:58,520
or Bamou is passed way.

317
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:00,440
Well.

318
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:01,560
I think...

319
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:02,080
pump one token.

320
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,280
Destination?

321
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,200
No.

322
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:07,840
Don't regret.

323
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:08,080
Hey,

324
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,400
beating the tambourine.

325
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,800
Fixed the absurdity of dream by bitterMark.

326
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:15,800
Paid for today.

327
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:16,880
I'll go in.

328
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:17,880
Train hard.

329
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:18,880
How about you?

330
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:19,880
Come on.

331
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,000
I'll form a groove

332
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:28,880
so that I can turn it around.

333
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,880
Jian.

334
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,880
Yue, why are you here?

335
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,880
I'm here to see what you've done.

336
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,880
I'm here to see what you've done.

337
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,880
I'm here to see what you've done.

338
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:44,880
I'm here to see what you've done.

339
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:46,840
Jian.

340
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:48,840
This is my classmate Lin Shengnan.

341
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,840
Hello.

342
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:50,840
She's a very passionate and powerful girl

343
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,840
who loves to play with flowers.

344
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:54,840
I've always wanted to introduce her to you.

345
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:55,840
By the way,

346
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,840
let her go to the gym with a master.

347
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,840
Girl?

348
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:04,840
You can play with flowers?

349
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,840
Yes, I like it.

350
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:08,840
Then, come on.

351
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,840
I dare not in front of you.

352
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,840
Shengnan, show me a show.

353
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:15,840
I'll give you a rating.

354
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:24,800
Is that okay?

355
00:18:24,800 --> 00:18:26,800
Guys, give me a ball.

356
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:27,800
Open it.

357
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,800
I'm leaving.

358
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:34,800
What's this?

359
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:35,800
It's a ball.

360
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:36,800
It's basically a ball.

361
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,800
It's a ball.

362
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:46,800
I'm going to throw it.

363
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:48,800
I don't want to.

364
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,800
I'm going to throw it.

365
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:50,800
OK.

366
00:18:54,800 --> 00:18:55,800
Shengnan,

367
00:18:55,800 --> 00:18:57,800
you've got a good play.

368
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,840
You can totally ignore my expectations.

369
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:00,840
How about this?

370
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,840
If you want to come to us for fun,

371
00:19:02,840 --> 00:19:04,800
or have any technical problems,

372
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:05,800
just come and find us.

373
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:06,800
I'll cut your hair.

374
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:07,800
Jian,

375
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:09,800
I've brought her to you today.

376
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:10,800
It's true that there is something.

377
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,800
You tell her.

378
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,800
I'll agree to anything.

379
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:15,600
Shen he can't hear him

380
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,240
I'll listen

381
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:17,400
Thank you

382
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,900
Xin

383
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,940
Can he join your interchange team

384
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,180
Shengnan, don't feel sad

385
00:19:42,180 --> 00:19:43,620
You're really good at playing.

386
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,100
If you want to find us to play

387
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,780
or have any technical problems,

388
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:47,740
you can come at any time.

389
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:48,820
But,

390
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,580
although I'm the captain of the team,

391
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:52,020
I can't

392
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,020
let this go.

393
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:55,220
Right, guys?

394
00:19:55,700 --> 00:19:56,660
Well...

395
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,300
Why do girls call me a coach?

396
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,020
No, no, no.

397
00:19:59,020 --> 00:19:59,940
That's not interesting.

398
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:04,340
I only have one request.

399
00:20:04,980 --> 00:20:06,740
I promise I'll train well.

400
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,220
Jian,

401
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,580
Shengnan can train like this.

402
00:20:10,820 --> 00:20:11,820
After joining the team,

403
00:20:12,220 --> 00:20:13,380
she'll work harder.

404
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,740
I can join too.

405
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,260
A'Yu,

406
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:20,260
if you're willing to come to our team,

407
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,980
I'll be very welcome.

408
00:20:22,420 --> 00:20:23,620
Why can't I?

409
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,420
You can see

410
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,660
that we're all boys.

411
00:20:29,860 --> 00:20:30,980
It's just because of this.

412
00:20:41,580 --> 00:20:43,500
I finally met a god.

413
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:45,780
He didn't even give me a chance.

414
00:20:46,580 --> 00:20:47,860
I had a great time tonight.

415
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:48,580
Thank you.

416
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:50,940
I have to go back

417
00:20:50,940 --> 00:20:52,540
and face my parents.

418
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:56,420
I brought you out today

419
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:58,340
just to make you feel better.

420
00:20:59,100 --> 00:21:00,580
High school and college are important.

421
00:21:00,980 --> 00:21:02,620
We still have a lot of time to face.

422
00:21:03,140 --> 00:21:04,900
We can't be invited by the same wedding.

423
00:21:05,620 --> 00:21:06,900
We still have dreams and time.

424
00:21:07,500 --> 00:21:08,820
We need to be strong

425
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:09,700
and considerate.

426
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,060
Think about it.

427
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,620
If you give up now,

428
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,660
how can you learn from it?

429
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:17,260
If you don't,

430
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,060
how can you get the chance to play?

431
00:21:24,940 --> 00:21:26,140
Do you want to join the team?

432
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,980
Of course I do.

433
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,660
Then listen to me.

434
00:21:30,420 --> 00:21:31,180
Learn well.

435
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,420
You'll know.

436
00:21:41,580 --> 00:21:42,380
Grandma.

437
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,020
Come out and rest.

438
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,060
Have some soup.

439
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:55,580
What are you doing?

440
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,380
Come sit.

441
00:22:01,180 --> 00:22:01,700
Dad.

442
00:22:02,180 --> 00:22:02,780
Mom.

443
00:22:03,420 --> 00:22:06,340
Is this the last bowl of rice?

444
00:22:07,820 --> 00:22:09,300
What time is it?

445
00:22:09,300 --> 00:22:10,380
Where is the bowl?

446
00:22:10,780 --> 00:22:11,900
It's a snack.

447
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:16,300
Actually, I wanted to come back early today.

448
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,820
But...

449
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,340
Grandma.

450
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:17,900
It's okay.

451
00:22:18,700 --> 00:22:20,500
It's because of the study.

452
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,220
It's normal.

453
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,860
Your colleague Dongdong

454
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:26,220
is your class's student committee member.

455
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:27,420
I heard that

456
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,700
you have a few days

457
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:30,500
to talk to him and your class leader

458
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,700
about the game.

459
00:22:33,860 --> 00:22:34,780
Dongdong said so?

460
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,620
Yes.

461
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,340
He is representing

462
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,820
the students of the university today.

463
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,540
As grandma said,

464
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:42,700
his parents are usually very busy

465
00:22:42,820 --> 00:22:44,100
and have no time to take care of him.

466
00:22:44,620 --> 00:22:46,220
He is very confident.

467
00:22:46,540 --> 00:22:48,100
He doesn't have to teach

468
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,380
the books and writing.

469
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,860
I really see

470
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,260
what a good opportunity.

471
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:56,980
The children who came out of the school

472
00:22:56,980 --> 00:22:58,300
really didn't say anything.

473
00:23:01,180 --> 00:23:01,820
Mom.

474
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,300
You are the one who attended the family meeting today.

475
00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,260
Yes.

476
00:23:05,660 --> 00:23:07,500
Your dad was in the car.

477
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,820
He was going to go to work

478
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,900
and attend the family meeting.

479
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,820
He sent a message on the platform.

480
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,940
He asked the airport to pick him up.

481
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:17,260
You know, he was retired.

482
00:23:17,420 --> 00:23:18,260
He was in debt.

483
00:23:18,260 --> 00:23:19,500
He was affected by business.

484
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,020
He went to pick him up.

485
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:22,140
The airport is so far away.

486
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,740
The family meeting will be late.

487
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,260
Dad.

488
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:28,300
You promised to go without him.

489
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,500
It's a pity.

490
00:23:30,940 --> 00:23:32,060
You didn't go today.

491
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,700
It's really a pity.

492
00:23:34,220 --> 00:23:35,180
Our boy

493
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:37,100
is very kind.

494
00:23:37,980 --> 00:23:41,980
He is a very kind and kind boy.

495
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,820
Who told you to take a loan?

496
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,380
You said that you had something to do with him.

497
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,660
You are the one who let me do it.

498
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:54,340
Mom.

499
00:23:54,940 --> 00:23:56,140
He praised me.

500
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,300
How did he praise me?

501
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:00,740
How did he praise you?

502
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Mom.

503
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:05,860
Don't worry.

504
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:08,580
I will definitely take good care of Song Nan.

505
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,740
And Song Nan is a very kind and kind boy.

506
00:24:12,860 --> 00:24:16,660
He is very close to our classmate.

507
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:18,220
He is like you.

508
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:19,820
He is kind.

509
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:23,260
He will definitely improve

510
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,940
when he is in a relationship with his classmates.

511
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:28,460
Our boy is so kind.

512
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,580
Song Nan is in our class.

513
00:24:30,580 --> 00:24:32,100
He is so kind.

514
00:24:32,420 --> 00:24:33,820
Don't worry.

515
00:24:34,820 --> 00:24:35,820
Mr. Yan.

516
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,820
Our boy is very kind.

517
00:24:39,220 --> 00:24:43,380
He is a very kind and kind boy.

518
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,180
Good boy.

519
00:24:45,180 --> 00:24:46,180
Don't worry.

520
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:49,820
Don't make that kind of garbage

521
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:50,820
with other kids.

522
00:24:50,820 --> 00:24:52,220
Who is garbage?

523
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:53,780
Nothing.

524
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,980
When Nan Nan was just in school,

525
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:58,780
Dong Dong was bullied by his classmates.

526
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,780
Nan Nan was the one who helped him.

527
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:04,140
Dong Dong was the one who helped him.

528
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:06,780
And the best classmate

529
00:25:06,780 --> 00:25:08,740
they learned at their age.

530
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:09,940
They were the class leaders.

531
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:12,340
They were very close to Nan Nan.

532
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,940
Really?

533
00:25:15,340 --> 00:25:16,140
Nan Nan.

534
00:25:16,740 --> 00:25:20,140
I believe you will be in a good university in the future.

535
00:25:20,380 --> 00:25:23,140
But you must be humble.

536
00:25:23,140 --> 00:25:24,740
You must be honest with your classmates.

537
00:25:25,140 --> 00:25:25,940
You must be polite.

538
00:25:26,620 --> 00:25:28,180
You must learn more.

539
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:28,940
Understand?

540
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,140
I understand.

541
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:32,540
I understand.

542
00:25:33,980 --> 00:25:37,340
I didn't expect Nan Nan to be so kind.

543
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:39,540
She is so kind.

544
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,340
She is so kind.

545
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,140
I understand.

546
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,940
Nan Nan is a good person.

547
00:25:43,940 --> 00:25:45,340
She is just like me.

548
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,140
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

549
00:25:47,540 --> 00:25:50,140
You are so kind.

550
00:25:50,380 --> 00:25:51,540
You are so friendly.

551
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,540
What's wrong with you?

552
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,540
You can't call me good

553
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,940
when you are a kid.

554
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:57,740
Dad.

555
00:25:57,940 --> 00:26:00,140
I will be close to them.

556
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,340
Okay.

557
00:26:01,740 --> 00:26:03,140
You must learn.

558
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:04,340
Don't let them down.

559
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:05,740
Drink it up.

560
00:26:05,940 --> 00:26:07,340
We should learn after drinking.

561
00:26:07,340 --> 00:26:07,940
Okay.

562
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:09,340
Eat the food.

563
00:26:13,940 --> 00:26:14,740
Have a bowl.

564
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,140
Eat more.

565
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,140
I want to eat more.

566
00:27:02,140 --> 00:27:03,340
I want to eat more.

567
00:27:03,340 --> 00:27:04,340
I want to eat more.

568
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,340
I want to eat more.

569
00:27:05,340 --> 00:27:06,340
