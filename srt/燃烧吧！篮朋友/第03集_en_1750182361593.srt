Let everything be the glory

00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
In the dark night, I'm not afraid

00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Listen to the sound of your favorite

00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It turns out to be a kind of love

Don't be afraid

00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen to the sound of your tiger and your shadow

00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Don't be afraid to wake up in the water

The hug becomes a secret

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
Protect me and you

It turns out to be a kind of love

00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't be afraid

00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000

The First Love

26
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
Episode 19

27
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:18,000
Xiao Wei, you are playing the ball, aren't you?

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,000
Why are you wearing your mask?

29
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,000
Learn some music first

30
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
I'll play the foundation for the future

31
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Listen to the sound

32
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,000
Say something

33
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
This is called music

34
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Don't you use this kind of eyes to look at me?

35
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,000
I advise you to give up

36
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
He doesn't like to listen to this

37
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I said recently

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Why do you pull me down and look at my face?

39
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
The more you pull, the more you pull

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,000
So you are not drunk

41
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,000
It's for someone

42
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,000
Don't bother me

43
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,000
I'm just a little familiar

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
No, you're wrong

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
He doesn't like to listen to this

46
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
Besides, what age is this

47
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
Who is still playing the piano?

48
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
What does he like?

49
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
Isn't the piano good?

50
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Those first love movies are not

51
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
The white dress, my mouth, flowers

52
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,000
And the beautiful long hair

53
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,000
Stop

54
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
Yue, don't make trouble for him

55
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:28,000
What if he does something else

56
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:30,000
We will be in trouble

57
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
Yue, stop talking

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,000
I can't say it anymore

59
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,000
I can't stand it

60
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
Tell me what are you doing

61
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
I'm going to kill you

62
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
I'm going to kill you

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
I'm going to kill you

64
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
That's really annoying

65
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
Hey, don't turn around

66
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
I have a photo of my family

67
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
The picture is pretty

68
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Since you know it

69
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Just let me have a photo of my family

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
It's ok

71
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Next time, I'll treat you to something else.

72
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,000
By the way,

73
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,600
your parents came back yesterday.

74
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,200
Are you happy too?

75
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,200
What did they make for you?

76
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:27,000
Eat, eat, eat.

77
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
I just want to eat.

78
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Why are you so angry this morning?

79
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
Just a bottle of milk.

80
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,000
Because of this, you don't drink it, I drink it.

81
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Episode 1

82
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
Let's go, let's eat.

83
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,000
Suyue,

84
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
play the ball later.

85
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Play, play, play.

86
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:25,000
It's a hurry.

87
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
Just a little time.

88
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
So, we can play for a while.

89
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Then let's eat first.

90
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Okay.

91
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
Yao Yao, let's go.

92
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Okay.

93
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
Come on, let's play the ball.

94
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,000
We two play together.

95
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
I think someone wants to have dinner.

96
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
Let's go, let's go.

97
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,000
Well,

98
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
after we finish dinner,

99
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
the squad leader will come to see the game.

100
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
Tell me if you want to know.

101
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,000
I'm not interested in basketball.

102
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I want to come back to study.

103
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:53,000
I, I, I know.

104
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,000
I know, I know.

105
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
You, you don't know basketball.

106
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why don't I know it?

107
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,000
You still call me that

108
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:01,000
when the squad leader doesn't know basketball.

109
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:03,000
It's okay if you know it.

110
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:06,000
You should play the basketball team well.

111
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
The basketball team is good.

112
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,000
I'll listen to you.

113
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
I don't know.

114
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,000
I'm not good.

115
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:16,000
Dong Dong,

116
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
let's play the ball together.

117
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
No, I'll come back to study.

118
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Okay.

119
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,000
What's wrong with you?

120
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Let's go, let's eat.

121
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
Come on, come on.

122
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
Come on.

123
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Okay, you've trained it.

124
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Come on.

125
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,000
Hello, you're here.

126
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Hello.

127
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Where's Han Ren?

128
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Why aren't you here yet?

129
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I'm here.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:08,000
They're here.

131
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I told you long ago.

132
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,000
He won't come.

133
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
My brother can't bully me.

134
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,000
We're done.

135
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:20,000
Not yet.

136
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,000
Not yet.

137
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,000
But,

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
he's waiting for you

139
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
and your eyes.

140
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What?

141
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,000
You're just a cat.

142
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,000
I'm not.

143
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Okay, let's start.

144
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
I don't think the weather is good today.

145
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:37,000
The weather is good.

146
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:59,000
Did you watch me for a long time?

147
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
What did you eat?

148
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,400
Winner is Aizhu.

149
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:14,840
When you are up next,

150
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:18,800
you can exhausted the VND2 app.

See what?

153
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,000
Don't resist me.

154
00:09:36,280 --> 00:09:41,020
Tough-œ descriptions!

155
00:09:41,020 --> 00:09:43,980
Ms. Zhang.

156
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:50,080
hospitalizedactic

157
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:57,200
We got a flat nose

158
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,260
We got a flat nose

159
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:05,840
A short person

160
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,120
Come on!

161
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,160

Come on!

167
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:15,960
Come on!

168
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,840
Come on!

169
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,640
Come on!

170
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,560

Come on!

174
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,760
Zongwei,

175
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:24,040
we just met you.

176
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,080
Let's play for another 10 minutes.

177
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:10,040
I'm here to drink water.

178
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:11,000
Thank you.

179
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:11,800
Thank you.

180
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,080
Please drink water.

181
00:11:13,080 --> 00:11:13,800
Okay.

182
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:14,800
Where's mine?

183
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,240
Just these.

184
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,680
Drink it.

185
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,840
Alright, let's go to class.

186
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,240
I just didn't make a good start.

187
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,480
What's the matter, Nan?

188
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:27,080
You're this girl in the girl.

189
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:27,680
You're this girl.

190
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:28,680
You're this girl.

191
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:29,680
You're this girl.

192
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:30,680
You're this girl.

193
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:31,680
You're this girl.

194
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,680
You're this girl.

195
00:11:32,680 --> 00:11:33,680
You're this girl.

196
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:34,680
You're this girl.

197
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:35,680
You're this girl.

198
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:38,320
What about me in Nanchun?

199
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:40,640
It's hard to say in Nanchun.

200
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,720
We have a band after all.

201
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,720
Don't be too hard on me.

202
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:46,320
You've been cheering for Zhang Wenjing.

203
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,320
You've been praising me.

204
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:51,920
It's really good to be a good player.

205
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:53,840
I'm the one who can do it.

206
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,160
Shengnan,

207
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:58,800
you were playing well just now.

208
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:00,960
But you didn't practice well.

209
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:02,480
Let's practice together.

210
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,480
Okay.

211
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:04,520
Then don't play it.

212
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:05,560
I'll play it.

213
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:08,200
Let's go.

214
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:09,200
Let's go to class.

215
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
Where's the ball?

216
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:11,320
There's our ball.

217
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:26,520
Dongdong,

218
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:29,520
it's rare to see you study abroad today.

219
00:12:30,440 --> 00:12:31,440
No.

220
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,320
You're my beloved.

221
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,240
No.

222
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,240
Shengnan,

223
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,160
I have something to tell you.

224
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,000
This morning,

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,720
a special-edited dog,

226
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,440
it's so funny.

227
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:47,880
Forget it.

228
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,760
What?

229
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,080
Dongdong,

230
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:51,880
what did you say?

231
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,320
The old rule.

232
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,720
Whoever gets 11 points first,

233
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,800
wins.

234
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,160
No problem.

235
00:13:10,160 --> 00:13:12,040
Rock, paper, scissors.

236
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,480
Rock, paper, scissors.

237
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,440
I've never won the third round.

238
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,840
Come on!

239
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:07,320
Be abbess, Don't be aalsible

240
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:30,800
Don't think there are such skillful girls

241
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,000
Don't guess

242
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:34,360
It's not appropriate to be a boy

243
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,880
My girls do some business

244
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,820
You are 시작ing the road

245
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:02,580
you are fifteen of me, i'm fifteen

246
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,300
Why are you always so cautious?

247
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,980
I'll give you two points, you'll give me two points,

248
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,540
I'll give you three points, you'll give me three points,

249
00:15:07,540 --> 00:15:08,620
did you do it on purpose?

250
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:09,740
No.

251
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,100
We can give you a close score.

252
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,860
It means that your ball is in the battle.

253
00:15:13,860 --> 00:15:15,900
We'll not share it between the weight.

254
00:15:17,020 --> 00:15:17,820
Really?

255
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,300
Yes.

256
00:15:19,180 --> 00:15:19,980
All right.

257
00:15:32,580 --> 00:15:34,180
Now, I'm 17, 18.

258
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:35,660
I didn't score just now.

259
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:36,740
I'll give you two points.

260
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,140
You should believe that I didn't choose you.

261
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:40,500
You won't give yourself a chance to make a difference.

262
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,300
Of course.

263
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,460
It's the key.

264
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:48,380
Again.

265
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,500
You're so good.

266
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:57,500
You're so good.

267
00:15:57,500 --> 00:15:58,500
You're so good.

268
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,500
You're so good.

269
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,500
You're so good.

270
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,500
You're so good.

271
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:02,940
You go a step back.

272
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:05,700
Go, have a fight!

273
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,540
Good ball!

274
00:16:08,540 --> 00:16:09,660
18-19?

275
00:16:09,660 --> 00:16:09,980
19 points!

276
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,400
Only 7 points at feedback?

277
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:15,580
Good.

278
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:17,300
Victor, that's better.

279
00:16:17,300 --> 00:16:18,660
You've three runs.

280
00:16:18,660 --> 00:16:19,820
You Space!

281
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:32,340
Relax

282
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:36,860
Doctor

283
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,380
這次

284
00:16:38,620 --> 00:16:39,420
可 photographs

285
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,120
消炸周詩

286
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:46,100
我用得了

287
00:16:52,820 --> 00:16:56,760
冷 let's toutes

288
00:16:57,800 --> 00:16:58,920
記下來

289
00:16:58,920 --> 00:16:59,920
I can tell that

290
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:02,720
you don't want to be a good player.

291
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:05,360
If you get caught by the other team,

292
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,920
you'll lose the game in an instant.

293
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:09,760
You're such a bad player.

294
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:11,280
Let's go.

295
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:13,040
I'll help you get up.

296
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,160
No need.

297
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:20,120
What's wrong, Shengnan?

298
00:17:20,240 --> 00:17:21,360
I'll give you a message later.

299
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,200
You should be careful

300
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,360
when you go to Dongdong.

301
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:24,600
You should be more confident.

302
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:25,800
I'll be more stable.

303
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,160
Are you

304
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,680
Multiple倒 distribution"?

305
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:30,420
Don't push.

306
00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:31,520
Go.

307
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:32,800
Go to

308
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:33,960
Dongdong.

309
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:40,160
I hit you.

310
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,080
I will make sure that you can make the back shot.

311
00:17:42,840 --> 00:17:44,080
Get up.

312
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:44,960
Please.

313
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:48,000
Chengdu,

314
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,440
I Kan Kam cuarto Street.

315
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:51,220
This construction thing is

316
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,040
wigist.

317
00:17:53,080 --> 00:17:53,640
No.

318
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:55,040
There's a place

319
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,880
Why would he do that, to speak on my phone?

320
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:04,260
Am I pretending to be crazy again?

321
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:22,320
He's back

322
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:24,200
It's so late today

323
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:26,240
not because there's peace in the world too.

324
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,200
What do you mean by peace?

325
00:18:29,320 --> 00:18:30,200
What do you mean?

326
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,200
Love is Celine'sIncontin boots.

327
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,200
It doesn't matter.

328
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,080
Only a pair of feet of such sizes

329
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:38,080
should be enough to hold in the reach of you.

330
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,080
How did you come to this blue ball again?

331
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,680
I'm...

332
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:56,200
Dad, you can say it.

333
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:01,400
Look, I'm not against you playing basketball.

334
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
But you're already in high school.

335
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,200
You have to be a student.

336
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,200
I'm in the third grade of Chinese school.

337
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:11,200
I'm just a student who's playing basketball.

338
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:13,000
I want to continue playing basketball.

339
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,400
I want to achieve my dream.

340
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,200
That dream is a dream.

341
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:24,000
You have to face reality in the end.

342
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:26,600
Why don't you play basketball?

343
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:28,200
Well, girls...

344
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:30,600
Girls...

345
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,800
They're not as good as boys after they're in high school.

346
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,600
They're not as good as boys.

347
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,000
You can't play basketball with them.

348
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,600
You'd better save time and put it on the right track.

349
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,600
I know you'll say that.

350
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:47,800
You're saying that because you're a boy and a girl.

351
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,600
Girls are not good at anything in your eyes.

352
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,200
Girls are not good at anything.

353
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:53,600
Are you satisfied with that?

354
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,200
Yes.

355
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:04,600
Did I say that I'm a boy and a girl?

356
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:08,000
Didn't you say that you care about the rules?

357
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,600
Can't you talk properly?

358
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,400
I didn't talk properly.

359
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:15,800
Well, the reaction of this boy is indeed a little bit bigger.

360
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:18,600
What's going on?

361
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,600
No one is going to stop me.

362
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:31,200
Does anyone even know?

363
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,800
Whatroduces fifty years is one of myépoqueеs feelings.

364
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:54,000
We have even met on the road tonight.

365
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:58,280
There is a false technical absorber.

366
00:20:59,320 --> 00:20:59,720
We seem wrong.

367
00:21:00,360 --> 00:21:02,120
But you know...

368
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:04,360
A real game fellow,

369
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,360
stronger than the previous kitchens.

370
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,660
Turns out you're like that pervert.

371
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:10,560
For real.

372
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:12,440
Because you confide in me,

373
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,260
so you don't want us to tear out.

374
00:21:14,460 --> 00:21:15,260
However,

375
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,860
with the last one they had,

376
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,760
they tried to kick up the menu.

377
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:21,280
So,

378
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:24,720
Shengnan, I have something to tell you.

379
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,480
You're not as good as you in school.

380
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,200
You're better than basketball.

381
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:31,360
Let's go.

382
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:32,200
Let's go.

383
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:33,720
Let's go.

384
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,960
Morning, Dongdong.

385
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:43,480
Morning.

386
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,680
Shengnan,

387
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:51,520

388
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:52,680
Eat it.

389
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:53,880
No need, Xi Xi.

390
00:21:53,880 --> 00:21:56,760
My mom said we should eat fast today.

391
00:21:59,160 --> 00:22:00,480
Here you go.

392
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:02,600
Dongdong,

393
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:04,120
you should eat it.

394
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:06,000
It's good for your health.

395
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,280
It can grow.

396
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,000
Really?

397
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,400
Thank you.

398
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:11,720
You're welcome.

399
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,000
Shengnan,

400
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:22,840
I've got a call from the Central Committee.

401
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,720
No need.

402
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:25,040
I've made an appointment.

403
00:22:25,040 --> 00:22:26,200
Right, Dongdong?

404
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:29,520
It's okay.

405
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,000
You two,

406
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,160
three of us,

407
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:32,920
can have a team.

408
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:33,640
No need.

409
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:35,240
I just want the two of us.

410
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:39,000
You're so fun.

411
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:40,600
I'm going to class.

412
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,240
I'm going back.

413
00:22:41,240 --> 00:22:42,480
I'll call you later.

414
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:50,200
Shengnan,

415
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,400
Dongdong,

416
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,160
here.

417
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,000
Over there.

418
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,600
What's wrong?

419
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,240
You...

420
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:00,840
You two are unhappy.

421
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:02,640
How can I eat it?

422
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,560
I'm begging you.

423
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,720
Okay, I'm done.

424
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:07,320
I'm going to the office.

425
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,400
There's cowardice in other people.

426
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,280
Then what do you want me to do?

427
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:14,560
All right, leave it to me.

428
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,960
You're coming this time?

429
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:21,160
I remember it was registered.

430
00:23:21,160 --> 00:23:23,080
I fed a good boy.

431
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,480
He didn't even come in here just yet.

432
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:27,800
He must feel guilty.

433
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:31,680
You see,

434
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:35,880
Dongdong享 can never be 처� Doesn't come out again?

435
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:38,480
I knew you wanted to use the three-point sandstone game.

436
00:23:39,680 --> 00:23:42,080
You've always seen how I want to play, right?

437
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:45,880
I probably know what's going on.

438
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:07,480
It broke off, I've never been there before.

439
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,840
That's how I've always been there.

440
00:24:09,840 --> 00:24:11,600
You really want to play, right?

441
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:19,240
Go!

442
00:24:25,400 --> 00:24:26,600
Come on!

443
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:30,600
Come on!

444
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,760
Come on!

445
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:34,280
Come on!

446
00:24:34,280 --> 00:24:34,920
One more.

447
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:36,000
Come on.

448
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:36,840
Come on.

449
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:51,000
Why don't you go up and play with them?

450
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:51,680
No.

451
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,400
Here we are, Brother Lan.

452
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:56,400
Let's go.

453
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,280
Let's play together.

454
00:24:57,280 --> 00:24:58,120
No.

455
00:24:58,120 --> 00:25:00,080
I just passed by and checked it.

456
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,240
You quarreled?

457
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,000
It's not that I'm fine.

458
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,400
Is it because of the match last night?

459
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:10,240
No.

460
00:25:10,840 --> 00:25:12,680
It's not about the match.

461
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,520
It's about the person.

462
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:18,640
No.

463
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:19,760
You go first.

464
00:25:19,760 --> 00:25:21,480
I won't go if you don't go.

465
00:25:21,480 --> 00:25:22,200
It's not interesting.

466
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,000
Coach.

467
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:26,920
Coach.

468
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:27,880
Coach.

469
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:28,720
Coach.

470
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,320
He bullied you.

471
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:38,880
It's not like that.

472
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:41,600
Zhou Yue looks pretty good.

473
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,880
You're not bullying me.

474
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,120
No, Jiao Xin.

475
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,080
You misunderstood.

476
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:47,280
You...

477
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:50,160
You just misunderstood.

478
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:51,680
Don't worry.

479
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,320
Jiao Xin and I will support you.

480
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,280
It's so sad.

481
00:25:56,920 --> 00:25:58,640
Why do you quarrel with Zhou Yue?

482
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:00,080
Zhou Yue...

483
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:01,880
Zhou Yue...

484
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:03,360
He can't look at me.

485
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:06,360
What?

486
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,720
Jiao Xin.

487
00:26:07,720 --> 00:26:08,880
Jiao Xin.

488
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:10,280
Jiao Xin.

489
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:10,840
Jiao Xin.

490
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:11,240
Jiao Xin.

491
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,000
Jiao Xin.

492
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:12,800
Jiao Xin.

493
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:17,040
He doesn't want to have a fair match with me.

494
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:23,520
Jiao Xin.

495
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,880
Jiao Xin.

496
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:25,520
Jiao Xin.

497
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:26,960
Jiao Xin.

498
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,480
Martin, pick it up.

499
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,460
The other well-off tonic is really the thing to try

500
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:35,700
to achieve what you want please don't go behind the prospects

501
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:37,620
Because you rarely edge out

502
00:26:37,620 --> 00:26:39,500
especially in the official business

503
00:26:39,500 --> 00:26:41,460
so values are essential

504
00:26:41,460 --> 00:26:43,580
and Evolution are Senaiden

505
00:26:45,580 --> 00:26:46,340
So I think

506
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:50,100
on the falling of our使谢谢贸

507
00:26:51,620 --> 00:26:52,460
And I think

508
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,100
thinking on the six trades

509
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,640
I think

510
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:56,640
I'm not a good person.

511
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,640
I'm not a good person.

512
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,640

I'm not a good person.

523
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:22,640
I'm not a good person.

524
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:24,640
