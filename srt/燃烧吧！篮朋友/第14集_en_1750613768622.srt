1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,000
How to complete your dream?

2
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'll turn you into a breeze

3
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,000
Let everything turn into glory

4
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,000
I'm not afraid of the night

5
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Listen, that's your favorite voice

6
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
I can't forget your back

7
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
It turns out that love is a kind of luck

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
Don't be afraid to give up

9
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
Listen, that's the sound of calling you

10
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:01,000
It's always on my mind in the dream

11
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
The hug becomes a secret

12
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Protect you and me

13
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Listen, that's your favorite voice

14
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can't forget you

15
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,000
It turns out that love is a kind of luck

16
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,000
Don't be afraid to give up

17
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Listen, that's your favorite voice

18
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I can't forget you

19
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:40,000
It turns out that love is a kind of luck

20
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
Don't be afraid to give up

21
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Listen, that's the sound of calling you

22
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,000
It's always on my mind in the dream

23
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,000
The hug becomes a secret

24
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,000
Protect you and me

25
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:58,000
The King of Blaze

26
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:00,000
Episode 1

27
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
If your father only has a low and incomprehensible view of your dream

28
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Even insults you for being a sexist

29
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
Wait

30
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,000
I think this insults you for being a sexist

31
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
I need to change it

32
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:26,000
Why? I think he just has an insult to me

33
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
First, his interests are wrong

34
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:34,000
Your father may have some men and women's thoughts

35
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Many of his words and actions

36
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Are mostly influenced by the old half of the values

37
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,000
His care and care for you has not decreased

38
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:49,000
So his intention is not to insult you for being a sexist

39
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:52,000
Maybe he doesn't think it's wrong

40
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,000
So I think it's not fair to him to define you like this

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
Yes, I agree with Yao Yao's opinion

42
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:02,000
The word sexist is too serious

43
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Instead of saying that

44
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
It's better to improve the public opinion of everyone

45
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Men and women are more sensitive to sexist than sexist

46
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:11,000
I agree too

47
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
Our parents have different environment

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So there are some thoughts

49
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
But we can't deny their love to us

50
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:20,000
Okay, I'll give him a clear judgement

51
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But I don't know how to change it

52
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,000
I think we can change it

53
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:31,000
For example, our parents

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
Have many thoughts about men and women

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,000
My father is one of them

56
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,000
He thinks playing basketball and sports

57
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Is something a boy should do

58
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:45,000
But I'm a girl

59
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So I love basketball

60
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:50,000
In his eyes, it becomes a business

61
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,000
It becomes a thing of doing a promotion

62
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Yes, this change is indeed more sensitive to sex

63
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
You are great

64
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
I also mean it

65
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But it's just that I've changed my mind

66
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
Then you should learn from Yao Yao

67
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
I'm learning

68
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
Don't praise

69
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Time is tight

70
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,000
Try to help him set the draft today

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
So that you can spare time on weekends

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
To recite more for Shengnan

73
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
Okay

74
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
There are only two things in this world

75
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,000
No matter what others do, they can't take it away

76
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,000
One is reading into the brain

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,000
Which is the knowledge we have learned

78
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Two is the dream we hide in our hearts

79
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,000
When will your debate competition

80
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Be held?

81
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
Next Wednesday

82
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
I think Shengnan is interesting

83
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
She's like a robot in everything

84
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Yes

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,000
I didn't expect her to be so energetic

86
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
It would be great if she could do this in school

87
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
You like Shengnan

88
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
What are you talking about?

89
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Why are you reacting so much?

90
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:05,000
Say it

91
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
Okay, I won't say it anymore

92
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
By the way, I have something serious to tell you

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
I have something serious to tell you

94
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:15,000
We may not need this venue until the summer vacation ends

95
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,000
The government has a plan

96
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,000
What should we do?

97
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,000
Let's find it again

98
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Anyway, the venue we're asking about is too expensive

99
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,000
Wait for the vacation

100
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
Shengnan and I will help you find it

101
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,000
That's great

102
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
I'm going to the foreign country to compete

103
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
It's been half a month

104
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,000
Is there a person this time?

105
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Should be

106
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,000
There are

107
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
According to the city

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
It's divided into group and individual competitions

109
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
Then the group competition is first

110
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
The individual competition should be in the summer vacation

111
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,000
You ask this

112
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
Do you and Shengnan want to participate?

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
No, I just ask

114
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,000
You tell me quickly

115
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
Do you want to participate

116
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Or do you want Shengnan to participate?

117
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,000
Stop talking

118
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
You say it quickly, I'll stop

119
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,000
Stop talking

120
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,000
Stop talking

121
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
If we have friends who support each other

122
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
If we have a firm belief

123
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,000
If we have a goal to achieve

124
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Then please don't stick to your dream

125
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
Even if the sky and earth are cold, the road is wide and the horse is yellow

126
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:30,000
Great

127
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
I'm so happy

128
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
I wrote and changed and changed and wrote

129
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,000
I wish I could use all the good words I learned in my life

130
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
If you are so serious about writing and writing

131
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
I can't do well in the exam

132
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,000
Don't be a bad boy

133
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,000
Joke with me

134
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:49,000
Shengnan

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,000
Mom, let me help you

136
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,000
No, I have mom at home

137
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:07,000
You just study hard

138
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Why are you back?

139
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Are you going to work?

140
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:15,000
Say who was the one who talked with you this afternoon?

141
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:17,000
Lao Li

142
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,000
I asked you, talk

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
Who is that man? What is your relationship?

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:22,000
man

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,000
What

146
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,000
Is it the one you talk about every day?

147
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,000
What is it called

148
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Zhou Yu

149
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Yes, that's him

150
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Dad, you see me

151
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,000
I really didn't see it wrong

152
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:40,000
You talk about you

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,000
What does Cheng Tian say

154
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,000
You know your daughter best

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:43,000
Your daughter is already in love

156
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,000
Don't you know you're a mother?

157
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Early love

158
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,000
Nana, what's going on?

159
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:48,000
You tell mom

160
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
Nana

161
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,000
Nana

162
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,000
Don't worry, don't worry

163
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,000
Hurry up

164
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,000
Let's get her out

165
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,000
Nana

166
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,000
Nana

167
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Are you better?

168
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Much better

169
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:07,000
See how good you are

170
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,000
The driver you came up with

171
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:12,000
I almost ate it

172
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:15,000
You came up and gave me a big hat

173
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,000
If I hadn't been hit by an apple

174
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
You wouldn't believe I was wronged

175
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,000
I'm not talking about you

176
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,000
What are you talking about all day

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
These kids have a clear relationship

178
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,000
Why do you have to say such a thing

179
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:32,000
You're the one who's a dad

180
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This, this, I

181
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
I'm not afraid of him

182
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,000
If you're a classmate

183
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
You can't pull the car on the street

184
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,000
Nana

185
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Nana

186
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,000
You said this today

187
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Fortunately, your dad saw it

188
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
If the neighbors saw it

189
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
I don't know what I'm wearing

190
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,000
Mom

191
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:57,000
We were also led to run away

192
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,000
I don't have

193
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:00,000
I don't have

194
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,000
Good good good

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,000
You don't have

196
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Mom and dad believe you

197
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,000
You said you're the one

198
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It's all you

199
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
All day long

200
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,000
I believe that our Nana

201
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:11,000
No such thought

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,000
Nana

203
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,000
Are you feeling better now

204
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
Why don't we go to the hospital

205
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
No, I'm fine

206
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:23,000
It's okay

207
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's okay

208
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,000
I didn't go to the hospital

209
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,000
No need

210
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
You see

211
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:30,000
What do you look at

212
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,000
Change shoes

213
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,000
My daughter

214
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,000
What if I take a look

215
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,000
Nana

216
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,000
Can i come in

217
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:48,000
Mom, come in

218
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Nana

219
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
Don't be so smart with your dad

220
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
He's just anxious

221
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
Mom believes you

222
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,000
Okay, okay

223
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
I'm sorry

224
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
I'm sorry

225
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,000
Okay, okay

226
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:15,000
Mom knows you're wronged

227
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
Mom hopes you can grow healthy

228
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:21,000
As long as you don't delay your studies

229
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Don't hurt others

230
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Mom will support you fully

231
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Really

232
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,000
Whatever I do

233
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Mom, you support me

234
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Mom is so good

235
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,000
How old is it

236
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Still lying

237
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Mom, do you have a dream

238
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
What is your dream

239
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Dream

240
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,000
When mom was young

241
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,000
What dream should I have

242
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,000
If you have to say it

243
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:57,000
Marry the person you like

244
00:10:58,000 --> 00:10:59,000
Even if it's my dream

245
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
Now it's a dream come true

246
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,000
There is also

247
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,000
Such a good baby daughter

248
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,000
Satisfied

249
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:11,000
Mom, you mean

250
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,000
Your dream is my dad

251
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
He's not a white horse prince

252
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,000
In my eyes

253
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
A white horse prince

254
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,000
Not as good as your dad

255
00:11:23,000 --> 00:11:25,000
Just like my dad

256
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Mom, you're so good

257
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
What do you want from my dad

258
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,000
Your dad is pretty good

259
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Quite lonely

260
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,000
He made money

261
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,000
Take it all home

262
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,000
He himself

263
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:39,000
Don't want to spend

264
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,000
Buy you something

265
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Never feel bad

266
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,000
By the way, mom

267
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
I want to ask you something

268
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
It's the last time I borrowed money

269
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,000
You and my dad

270
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,000
So many fights

271
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:55,000
Why do you still insist

272
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:57,000
Lend the money to that aunt

273
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
Nana

274
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:02,000
This money

275
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
For our family

276
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,000
Although hard to earn

277
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,000
But not yet

278
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
Break down the house

279
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,000
But you urge aunt

280
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
If there is no

281
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:14,000
These tens of thousands of dollars to save lives

282
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:16,000
But it's going to break down the house

283
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,000
Mom, aren't you afraid of this money

284
00:12:21,000 --> 00:12:23,000
Can't you get it back?

285
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,000
Nana

286
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:29,000
In this world

287
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,000
There are many things

288
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,000
More important than money

289
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,000
For example, family and friendship

290
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,000
Family

291
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,000
Your most important dream

292
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,000
And conscience

293
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:49,000
Mom came out of the village

294
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:51,000
To be precise

295
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,000
Is forced out

296
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,000
My hometown

297
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Thought behind

298
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
I was back then

299
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,000
Just don't want to be confused

300
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,000
Marry someone you don't like

301
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,000
This is the first time Li Xiang entered the city

302
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:09,000
Your Cuiyu aunt

303
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,000
Can't leave the country

304
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:13,000
Married to the current man

305
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,000
His daughter Zhao Ding

306
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,000
A few years older than you

307
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,000
Small age

308
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,000
Married to such a hidden

309
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,000
A poor family

310
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,000
In his family

311
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,000
Unless Zhao Ding can be in the mother's house

312
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Take care of your body

313
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
Otherwise, I don't want to care

314
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,000
I know

315
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,000
Even now

316
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,000
He's lying in the hospital

317
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,000
I don't ask

318
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:39,000
I really didn't expect

319
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:40,000
How could it be like this

320
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,000
Nana

321
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:46,000
Cuiyu aunt

322
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,000
Love Zhao Ding's mood

323
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,000
Just like mom

324
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,000
Love you the same

325
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,000
If back then

326
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,000
Then you are not you

327
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,000
But Zhao Ding

328
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
Everything Zhao Ding has experienced

329
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,000
It's possible that you have experienced

330
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,000
So Nana

331
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Mom can't bear

332
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,000
Mom heard about Zhao Ding

333
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Will think of you

334
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
I help Cuiyu aunt

335
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,000
Actually

336
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Just helping that

337
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:25,000
Unleashed yourself

338
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Can you understand

339
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:29,000
Mom

340
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,000
I understand

341
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,000
Dad and mom

342
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Love you

343
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Your dad is a man

344
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,000
Talk and do things

345
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,000
It's a little bit anxious

346
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,000
But his heart is good

347
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,000
Sometimes

348
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:47,000
Don't just listen to what he says

349
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,000
Have to see

350
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,000
What did he do for you

351
00:14:51,000 --> 00:14:53,000
Just say these tens of thousands of dollars

352
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:55,000
He is not happy in his heart

353
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Then he doesn't want to

354
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,000
Yes

355
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,000
No matter how reluctant

356
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,000
That's not one, mom

357
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:00,000
I believe you

358
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
Also believe him

359
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,000
We both

360
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,000
I hope you get better and better

361
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
Mom

362
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,000
I know

363
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
I will study hard in the future

364
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,000
Whether it's on study

365
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,000
Or on the orchard

366
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,000
I will do my best

367
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,000
To do

368
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Good boy

369
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,000
Okay, I won't say it

370
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:26,000
I won't bother you to study

371
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Mom, you rest early

372
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,000
Don't be too late

373
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:56,000
I have to say

374
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,000
You are really a man this time

375
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,000
Wrote well

376
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,000
Yes, Brother Nan

377
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,000
Your article is too strong

378
00:16:02,000 --> 00:16:04,000
Who said you won't debate in the future

379
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,000
I am the first

380
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Thank you brother

381
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
You wrote so well

382
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,000
There are reasons and sentences

383
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,000
And it's amazing

384
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,000
I'm moved

385
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:13,000
Why are you suddenly used to it

386
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
Actually

387
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:17,000
I realized it yesterday

388
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:19,000
Not recognized by parents

389
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:20,000
Dream

390
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,000
Everyone is busy

391
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
In this matter

392
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,000
Everyone has experienced this

393
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,000
In every way

394
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,000
For example, my mom

395
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:29,000
Her persistence and courage

396
00:16:29,000 --> 00:16:31,000
Brought me a lot of inspiration

397
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,000
So I got the inspiration

398
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
It seems that aunt

399
00:16:37,000 --> 00:16:38,000
Is your goddess of youth

400
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,000
Of course

401
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:41,000
The competition is in two days

402
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
I have to practice the draft

403
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,000
I'm shocked by what you said

404
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,000
Then let's cheer up

405
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:49,000
Come on, come on, come on

406
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:54,000
Come on

407
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,000
Students

408
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:01,000
The day after tomorrow

409
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:03,000
Is the final of the debate

410
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,000
The efforts of our class

411
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,000
The teacher is watching

412
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,000
I hope the students in the arena

413
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:14,000
Can get the best state

414
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:15,000
Wish everyone

415
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
Get a good result

416
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,000
Our whole class

417
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,000
Will cheer for you

418
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:22,000
At the same time

419
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,000
I want to remind everyone

420
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,000
At present, for you

421
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:29,000
Learning is the first

422
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:32,000
The school leader has issued a notice recently

423
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:35,000
Demand to start in the whole school

424
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,000
Not fixed time

425
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:38,000
Not fixed people's salary

426
00:17:38,000 --> 00:17:40,000
So your learning attitude

427
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,000
Can't be relaxed

428
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:43,000
Write it

429
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,000
Yes

430
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:47,000
Ok, let's start class

431
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,000
Is the teacher too narrow?

432
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,000
This is their job

433
00:17:56,000 --> 00:17:57,000
Don't worry

434
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,000
Generally, it's only three to five

435
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:02,000
Who said I was worried about this

436
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,000
I still have to think about it

437
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:06,000
How to stop the debate

438
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:10,000
If the dream is to make money

439
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:13,000
Then we can do any job

440
00:18:13,000 --> 00:18:14,000
Will be rewarded

441
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,000
I think the opposite is

442
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Is to cancel the concept of dream and work

443
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,000
If a job

444
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:23,000
Only can get salary

445
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:25,000
But can't make people shine

446
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,000
Can't make people

447
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:28,000
Love from the heart

448
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:30,000
Then how can he

449
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Deserve this dream

450
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,000
Many people are poor and alone

451
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,000
Don't know what to do

452
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:39,000
And the person with a dream

453
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:41,000
It's a step faster than others

454
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,000
Actually, when I first got this

455
00:18:43,000 --> 00:18:45,000
When the body was moved

456
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,000
I was touched by Shensheng

457
00:18:47,000 --> 00:18:48,000
Because

458
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,000
This is my story

459
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:52,000
Basketball is my dream

460
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,000
However, on the way to the dream

461
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:57,000
Have friends who support you

462
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,000
Have an unwavering determination

463
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:02,000
We will never be defeated

464
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,000
Brother Jian

465
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:15,000
Brother Jian, I heard from Zhou Yue

466
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,000
This site can't be used

467
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,000
Then we find a new site

468
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,000
Did you find it?

469
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,000
She is also worried about this recently

470
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:21,000
I found a change for her

471
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Not yet solved

472
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,000
So hard to find

473
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Expensive

474
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,000
How about we find it with you

475
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,000
Yes, let's go together

476
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:37,000
More people, more power

477
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:39,000
That's great

478
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:40,000
You are willing to help

479
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:41,000
I can't help

480
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,000
Dad, I'm coming

481
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:52,000
Why are you still in the toilet today?

482
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Your teacher Yan is coming to visit

483
00:19:55,000 --> 00:19:57,000
What? The card is coming?

484
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,000
Teacher Yan is Teacher Yan

485
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,000
What card?

486
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Come and help

487
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,000
coming

488
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Hurry up

489
00:20:15,000 --> 00:20:16,000
Hurry up

490
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:28,000
Teacher Yan

491
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,000
Welcome

492
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,000
Please come in

493
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:33,000
No need, no need

494
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:34,000
Please sit

495
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:45,000
Teacher Yan

496
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:47,000
Please have some tea

497
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,000
Thank you

498
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,000
Teacher Yan, please have some fruit

499
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:50,000
Thank you, Song Nuan

500
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,000
Don't bother, sit down

501
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:56,000
Song Nuan, sit down too

502
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,000
Teacher Yan

503
00:21:00,000 --> 00:21:02,000
It's your first time here

504
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,000
I'm sorry for not having you

505
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,000
No, no

506
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:07,000
I'm here too early

507
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,000
I'm sorry to bother you

508
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,000
No, no

509
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:11,000
No bother, no bother

510
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:13,000
Teacher Yan

511
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:16,000
Did Song Nuan

512
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,000
cause you any trouble at school?

513
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,000
And let you go in person

514
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,000
No, no

515
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,000
Song Nuan's dad, you misunderstood

516
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:24,000
Song Nuan's recent performance

517
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:25,000
is very good

518
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
We do housework

519
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,000
Sometimes

520
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,000
It's for this

521
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
Further strengthening the school

522
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:34,000
And a communication with parents

523
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:36,000
It's not that the child has done something wrong

524
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:39,000
It's good that you didn't make a mistake

525
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,000
It's good that you didn't make a mistake

526
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,000
This time

527
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:44,000
I'm here to congratulate you

528
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,000
Song Nuan's last month's pre-evaluation

529
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:49,000
The results are not bad

530
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,000
In the whole grade

531
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,000
It's ten more

532
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,000
And a few days ago

533
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:57,000
He participated in the school debate

534
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,000
Won the first place in the school

535
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,000
These are濃縮, right?

536
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:10,000
These kids didn't tell me

537
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,000
Look

538
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:15,000
This is the meaning of my visit

539
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:20,000
Song Nuan prepared the competition with great care

540
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,000
In the speech

541
00:22:22,000 --> 00:22:24,000
I also shared with you

542
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,000
Your education method

543
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,000
You mentioned me

544
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,000
Song Nuan's dad

545
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:35,000
Your education method

546
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,000
Actually I can understand

547
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:40,000
Your criticism of Song Nuan

548
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,000
I hope he can do this better

549
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:46,000
This should be love

550
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,000
Be a concubine

551
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:49,000
Yes, yes, yes

552
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:51,000
I think so

553
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,000
I usually don't blame the children

554
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,000
He can have today's achievement

555
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,000
Love my mom

556
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:05,000
Song Nuan's dad

557
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,000
This

558
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,000
This

559
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,000
Strict

560
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,000
Strict is good

561
00:23:11,000 --> 00:23:13,000
Patience is good

562
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:17,000
Now, we are promoting education of love

563
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,000
I think

564
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,000
We can't be too strict

565
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,000
To criticize the child

566
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:26,000
Because of the child in puberty

567
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:28,000
He has his own thoughts

568
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:30,000
Self-esteem is very strong

569
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,000
We as parents

570
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:34,000
Should tolerate them

571
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:35,000
Respect them

572
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,000
Look

573
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:39,000
Song Nuan's recent achievements are so good

574
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,000
You should praise him

575
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Teacher, I

576
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,000
I didn't

577
00:23:45,000 --> 00:23:46,000
I

578
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,000
I must

579
00:23:47,000 --> 00:23:48,000
As the saying goes

580
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:52,000
The one who is in the mood is the one who is in the mood

581
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:56,000
Since Dongdong began to teach Song Nuan to learn

582
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:59,000
Song Nuan's achievements have really improved

583
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
You

584
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:03,000
I think

585
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:06,000
You should communicate with the child

586
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,000
In this case

587
00:24:07,000 --> 00:24:10,000
You will know what he is thinking

588
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,000
I must

589
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:16,000
But in terms of communication

590
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:18,000
I'm really not good at it

591
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:22,000
It doesn't matter

592
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:24,000
Any child's growth

593
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,000
Can't live without the support and tolerance of the parents

594
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:30,000
You should make him feel that you love him

595
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:32,000
It's his strong backing

596
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:34,000
This is the most important

597
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,000
Do you think so?

598
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,000
What you taught

599
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:39,000
I must listen to your teaching

600
00:24:39,000 --> 00:24:40,000
Communicate with him

601
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,000
There are no other problems

602
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,000
It's late

603
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:48,000
Then I'll go

604
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:49,000
No, no, no

605
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:50,000
Don't worry

606
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:51,000
Let's go after dinner

607
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,000
Yes, yes, yes

608
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:53,000
Teacher Yan

609
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Why don't you stay and have dinner together?

610
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,000
My mom will be back in a while

611
00:24:56,000 --> 00:24:57,000
The food she cooked is delicious

612
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,000
Teacher Yan

613
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,000
Teacher Yan

614
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,000
I have the next family to go

615
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,000
You guys go ahead

616
00:25:02,000 --> 00:25:03,000
Don't worry

617
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,000
What are you doing for the teacher?

618
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,000
Teacher

619
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:07,000
Go up

620
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,000
I'm leaving

621
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:11,000
Okay, okay, okay

622
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,000
Teacher, take care

623
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,000
Goodbye, teacher Yan

624
00:25:13,000 --> 00:25:14,000
Goodbye

625
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:20,000
Good performance

626
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:21,000
That's right

627
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:23,000
Why don't you tell me

628
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,000
You are preparing for the debate

629
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,000
Dad, you didn't give me a chance to say

630
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,000
You should have told me earlier

631
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:30,000
It's okay to prepare for the competition

632
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:32,000
Girls should do this

633
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:34,000
Something that is both artistic and beautiful

634
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,000
Not bad

635
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,000
What can you do if you play basketball every day?

636
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:39,000
By the way

637
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,000
Be sure to talk to your teacher Yan

638
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:45,000
The one called Zhu Dongdong today

639
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,000
Communicate more and learn

640
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,000
Don't play basketball with that Zhou Yue

641
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:51,000
Girls should do

642
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:52,000
What girls should do

643
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,000
Understand

644
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:55,000
Forget it, forget it

645
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,000
I won't talk to you

646
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,000
