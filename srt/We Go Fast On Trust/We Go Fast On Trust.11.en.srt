00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:52,679
Miss Bi, what brings you here?

16
00:01:52,679 --> 00:01:54,196
Well…

17
00:01:54,196 --> 00:01:57,860
I need to come clean to Mr. Mobai about something.

18
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:04,064
It's about that…

19
00:02:05,799 --> 00:02:07,148
I…

20
00:02:07,879 --> 00:02:09,728
Before I…

21
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:11,884
You can tell me when you are ready.

22
00:02:12,639 --> 00:02:15,900
I don't think Shen Xi caused that accident.

23
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:17,810
What do you mean?

24
00:02:17,810 --> 00:02:19,219
I…

25
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:22,860
I previously helped to send data for her. I'm not sure if I left it behind.

26
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:24,819
Because of the car accident,

27
00:02:24,819 --> 00:02:28,280
I only found it in my bag yesterday. No clue how it got there.

[Data]
Then, why are you only bringing this up now?

29
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,699
I was scared.

30
00:02:31,699 --> 00:02:33,919
You're not scared now?

31
00:02:34,476 --> 00:02:39,580
I am, but I can't just ignore my conscience.

32
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:42,796
I'm going to tell Miss Mofei in a moment and then resign.

33
00:02:42,796 --> 00:02:44,144
Wait a minute.

34
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:51,919

[Game Record]
On the Test Day,

36
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:04,399
I'm going to use Shen Xi's data.

37
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:10,839
Are you sure? Your accident may be a misunderstanding.

38
00:03:10,839 --> 00:03:14,220
But Shen Chuan did have an accident.

39
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:18,339
I don't want to doubt anyone, but you can't always rely on your gut feeling.

40
00:03:18,339 --> 00:03:20,820
Should I go with the safe data from Mr. Liu and wait for defeat?

41
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:24,240
Then why didn't you tell Miss Mofei about this?

42
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:28,040
Her prejudice against Shen Xi is too deep,
so it's no use talking about it.

43
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:31,219
I'm not just going with my gut feeling here. 
I've tested out Shen Xi's adjustments to the car,

44
00:03:31,219 --> 00:03:33,960
and it's completely different from Mr. Liu's.

Achieve great success in one fell swoop.

46
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:41,120
Why don't I help her break all of her restraints?

47
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:44,000
She always gets stuck in her own traps.

48
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:48,264
This time, I'm going to tell her

49
00:03:49,259 --> 00:03:50,640
that she's worth trusting,

50
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,300
not just for me, but for all of us.

51
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:05,576
I support Mobai and Xi.

52
00:04:07,039 --> 00:04:11,759
I don't think there should be any problems with this data.

53
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:19,700
It seems that I can only use the famous racer Chen Mobai's motto from now on.

54
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:22,480

- Let's do it.
- Let's go.

58
00:04:29,019 --> 00:04:32,959
By the way, the issue of using Shen Xi's data

59
00:04:32,959 --> 00:04:34,848
must be kept secret to the outside.

60
00:04:34,848 --> 00:04:36,172
Ok.

00:04:49,348 --> 00:04:54,052
[Even if the whole world doesn't believe you]

62
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,304
Mobai,

63
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,580
are there any issues?

64
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:20,480
You don't trust me?

65
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,659
It's not that, just in case…

66
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:25,940
What if it rains? What should we do then?

67
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:27,800
Why don't we reschedule it?

68
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:30,420
I've already notified everyone. Reporters are coming today.

69
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:32,459
Even if it rains acid, we have to do it.

70
00:05:32,459 --> 00:05:34,959
Why don't we replace the rain tires in advance?

71
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:37,279
This way, although the speed is slower, it would be a lot safer.

72
00:05:37,279 --> 00:05:39,660
When did you become such a fusspot?

73
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:41,980
The bystander is more concerned than the person concerned

74
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,056
Xu Gong, give me at the scene later.

75
00:05:45,056 --> 00:05:47,559
Mobai, where are you going?

76
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:49,572
It's about to start.

77
00:05:50,100 --> 00:05:52,520
What did I do wrong?

78
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,720
I can't watch Mr. Mobai test the car. I have to work overtime here.

79
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:02,792
I'm sorry.

80
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,508
Mr. Mobai,

81
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,204
are you free today?

82
00:06:16,204 --> 00:06:17,880
Me?

83
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,240
Yes.

84
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:22,939
Would you mind finishing Shen Xi's record today?

85
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,944
Come with me.

86
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:41,900
Even though this is quite important,

87
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:44,040
does Chen Mobai have to call all the reporters?

88
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,679
It looks like Mr. Mobai is pretty confident.

89
00:06:46,679 --> 00:06:50,640
To save his few people, he must have put in a lot of effort.

90
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,339
It sounds like Mr. An doesn't really want Chen Mobai to win.

91
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:58,380
On this point, I'm with Miss Zhao.

92
00:06:58,380 --> 00:07:02,800
Professional matters should be left to professionals.

93
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,639
His rag-tag team should be replaced.

94
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:12,600
Are you worried about rain?

95
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:15,816
Murphy's Law.

96
00:07:16,519 --> 00:07:19,460
This time, he's not just doing it for himself but for everyone.

97
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:23,460
So he will give it his all. Don't worry.

98
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,976
What?

99
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:29,399
Does Miss Mofei lack confidence today?

100
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:33,600
It depends. I believe in Chen Mobai's ability

101
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:36,460
but after all, but he's recently recovered from a big injury,

102
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:39,600
so I hope he takes care of himself

103
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,480
and does his best.

104
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:44,920
On the other hand, I think Miss Zhao

105
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:48,140
has a higher agenda for today's bet.

106
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:55,979
I am uncertain for a moment what Miss Mofei just said 
was a compliment or a tease.

107
00:07:57,079 --> 00:07:59,500
For a professional investor,

108
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:01,860
the value of perspective and business reputation

109
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:04,259
far outweighs that of money.

110
00:08:04,259 --> 00:08:06,600
If Mobai loses this match,

111
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:12,800
you win the right to change people but lose the ability to judge people.

112
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:15,379
This is certainly not what you want.

113
00:08:15,379 --> 00:08:16,884
So…

114
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:21,679
You hope to lose this bet more than I do,

115
00:08:21,679 --> 00:08:23,920
so it can give Ruifeng a build-up.

116
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:28,160
If you put it that way, what I thought was a win-win situation for me

117
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,079
is now actually a win-win for you.

118
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,840
I'm in a lose-lose situation, right?

119
00:08:37,579 --> 00:08:41,760
This is a win-win situation, Miss Zhao. Our goals

120
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:45,580
have always been the same from the beginning.

121
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:16,399
Why did you bring me here?

122
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,560
You just stand here and watch me test-drive.

123
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:22,140
You must watch my test-drive.

124
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:24,319
The data I'm using today is yours.

125
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,200
I will let everyone know who you are.

127
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:39,624
Mobai, hurry up and pack before it rains.

128
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:42,660
I have to go. You won't be discovered here.

129
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,540
Wait for me. Wait for me here.

130
00:09:50,039 --> 00:09:54,200
Don't worry.
I have faith in the car you designed.

131
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:03,819
No. Chen Mobai.

132
00:10:03,819 --> 00:10:05,720
Sorry, you can't get in.
We are clearing the area.

133
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:07,620

134
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:09,440
Please wait outside.

135

gradually approaching the race car,
looking calm.

140

His opponent Mitsui Taku's speed up

158

00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:20,528
♫ Your departure ♫

353
00:30:21,536 --> 00:30:25,256
♫ Only left a transparent wound ♫

354
00:30:29,632 --> 00:30:32,888
♫ I keep falling ♫

355
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:36,892
♫ Towards the direction you left ♫

356
00:30:36,892 --> 00:30:40,820
♫ I'm embracing the fragments of memory ♫

357
00:30:40,820 --> 00:30:44,820
I… It seems like it's

358
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:48,440
the first time I see you dress like this.

359
00:30:50,060 --> 00:30:53,240
I just suddenly feel like wearing a dress.

360
00:30:54,364 --> 00:30:58,764
♫ Come back, my love ♫

361
00:30:58,764 --> 00:31:05,316
♫ In the sea of life, you are the only light ♫

362
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,120
You look very beautiful.

363
00:31:12,036 --> 00:31:15,664
♫ Being scratched by the fragments of memory ♫

364
00:31:15,664 --> 00:31:19,940
♫ Being scratched by the fragments of memory ♫

365
00:31:19,940 --> 00:31:24,676
♫ Come back, my love ♫

366
00:31:24,676 --> 00:31:30,140
♫ In the sea of life, you are the only light ♫

367
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:36,716
♫ Don't leave me in the endless night ♫

368
00:31:38,079 --> 00:31:41,199
I caused you to get injured before.

369
00:31:41,199 --> 00:31:43,839
Why did you still believe in me so much?

370
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:48,359
My trust in you has never once changed.

371
00:31:48,359 --> 00:31:50,376
You know what?

372
00:31:50,376 --> 00:31:54,952
The accident last time was due to an issue with the car parameters.

373
00:31:54,952 --> 00:31:58,440
When you asked your coworker
to send the documents, she lost the data.

374
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,556
It's not your fault.

375
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:03,619
She also admitted her mistake to me,

376
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:08,219
but I feel like it's useless to
make a big fuss about it.

377
00:32:08,219 --> 00:32:11,039
It's better to show everyone the results
directly.

378
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,840
You are the engineer who suits me the best.

379
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:22,959
I'm not a qualified engineer.

380
00:32:24,836 --> 00:32:26,648
At that time, my brother--

381
00:32:26,648 --> 00:32:28,536
You know

382
00:32:28,536 --> 00:32:32,419
racing in itself is a contest between
control and losing control,

383
00:32:32,419 --> 00:32:34,480
so no matter what happens,

384
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,619
any unexpected event, any accident,

385
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,328
it's nobody's fault.

386
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:43,819
Can you not put so much pressure on yourself?

387
00:32:45,279 --> 00:32:47,559
If everything I do

388
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:51,060
can make you believe that you're worth it,

389
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:55,860
even just a little bit, even a bit is enough, Shen Xi.

390
00:32:57,900 --> 00:32:59,872
I think you should

391
00:33:01,580 --> 00:33:05,059
restore your timeline

392
00:33:05,059 --> 00:33:11,239
to a normal life, like that of a sprout,

393
00:33:11,839 --> 00:33:16,760
so that those who care about you won't feel sad.

394
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:23,680
Shen Xi, you can be upset with the world,

395
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:26,840
but I hope that you must believe

396
00:33:26,840 --> 00:33:29,140
you deserve all the best.

397
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,876
Give me your hand.

398
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:33,288
I made it.

399
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:38,200
We made the lithium-ion battery.

400
00:34:51,320 --> 00:34:53,420
There were countless times

401
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:57,680
that I dreamed about this moment.

402
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:05,200
I was crying, laughing,

403
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:08,260
screaming,

404
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,080
smashing your car,

405
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:16,200
but I really didn't think

406
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,340
I would feel like this now.

407
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,464
I'm happy for you.

408
00:35:29,539 --> 00:35:32,600
Actually, I've never known if

409
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:37,679
what I have been insisting on is it right or wrong.

410
00:35:37,679 --> 00:35:39,652
It's right.

411
00:35:39,652 --> 00:35:42,060
Because you have courage.

412
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,679
You have the courage to do
what others dare not do,

413
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,519
so I know you will definitely succeed.

414
00:35:48,519 --> 00:35:50,939
Your whole family is like this.

415
00:35:50,939 --> 00:35:54,664
The chairman, Mobai,

416
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,288
and you.

417
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:17,920
It's hot.

418
00:36:18,679 --> 00:36:19,712
Slow down.

419
00:36:20,719 --> 00:36:22,320
Can't you eat something nutritious?

420
00:36:23,199 --> 00:36:24,399
There are meat and vegetables.

421
00:36:24,399 --> 00:36:26,080
There are all kinds of stuff.

422
00:36:26,080 --> 00:36:27,136
How can it not be nutritious?

423
00:36:35,519 --> 00:36:36,519
How is Chen Mobai?

424
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,880
Hao Yang just called and said he has found him.

425
00:36:44,928 --> 00:36:45,940
You…

426
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:47,239
I know I shouldn't have hit her.

427
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,016
I wanted to ask

428
00:36:51,079 --> 00:36:52,160
are you okay.

429
00:36:56,679 --> 00:36:57,760
I know

430
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:01,599
you are protecting Mobai in your own way.

431
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,719
Maybe we are all protecting the ones

432
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,480
we want to protect in our own way.

433
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:52,416
I'll leave now.

434
00:37:54,719 --> 00:37:57,696
Think more about the engineer thing.

435
00:37:57,696 --> 00:38:00,128
I'll wait for your reply.

436
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,500
Don't forget to dry your hair
when you get home.

437
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:08,512
Don't catch a cold.

438
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:16,599
Okay. See you.

439
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,159
You're back.

440
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:06,368
Why are you here?

441
00:39:08,039 --> 00:39:09,940
My dorm at school is lights-out,

442
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:11,400
but I haven't finished my homework yet,

443
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,480
so I came to cram at the last minute.

444
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,352
Wait a minute.

445
00:39:17,639 --> 00:39:19,320
Where did you get this dress from?

446
00:39:20,159 --> 00:39:21,760
Cute dress.

447
00:39:22,719 --> 00:39:25,680
You finally realized it. Not bad.

448
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:26,719
What are you talking about?

449
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:31,199
I got wet from a sudden heavy rain,

450
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,119
so I just bought one randomly.

451
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,819
It sounds like a long story,

452
00:39:37,819 --> 00:39:39,760
but I have time.

453
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,000
I can spare a bit to listen.

454
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:43,719
Go ahead and tell me.

455
00:39:53,039 --> 00:39:54,360
If there was a person,

456
00:39:56,159 --> 00:39:59,760
he was supposed to do something to you,

457
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:06,400
but he didn't.

458
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:10,560
Why?

459
00:40:11,760 --> 00:40:12,780
Hold on. Wait a minute.

460
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,280
You've confused me.

461
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,960
Who was supposed to do what to you?

462
00:40:20,079 --> 00:40:21,079
It's just

463
00:40:23,039 --> 00:40:26,280
there was a person who was very close to me.

464
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:27,392
I thought

465
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,300
he was going to kiss me, but he didn't.

466
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:31,719
What an idiot.

467
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:34,400
What idiot?

468
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:36,440
Chen Mobai's brain isn't working.

469
00:40:37,159 --> 00:40:40,140
That day, he bought you a lot of breakfast.

470
00:40:40,140 --> 00:40:41,519
I thought he was good at it.

471
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:42,639
He must be a veteran in love.

472
00:40:43,159 --> 00:40:45,239
Who knows he is such an idiot?

473
00:40:47,159 --> 00:40:49,920
It seems like I need to reassess him.

474
00:40:52,360 --> 00:40:54,020
What breakfast?

475
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:55,840
I didn't say it was Chen Mobai.

476
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,280
if it's not Chen Mobai,
then who else can it be?

477
00:41:01,159 --> 00:41:02,840
At this point,

478
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,240
I really don't know what's going on
in Chen Mobai's brain.

479
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:07,480
What could be more important than love?

480
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,440
What love?

481
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,000
Love-love.

482
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:18,159
The romantic type.

483
00:41:20,239 --> 00:41:22,839
He just wanted me to be his engineer.

484
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:24,639
We're not in that kind of relationship

485
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:28,640
Whether you're in that kind of relationship
right now is not important.

486
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,840
What's important is
what kind of relationship you want it to be.

487
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:38,360
We are just friends.

488
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,960
Friends?

489
00:41:42,159 --> 00:41:43,159
Then let me ask you.

490
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:46,040
If you two were alone,

491
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:47,400
would you feel nervous?

492
00:41:50,559 --> 00:41:52,760
Or if you two

493
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:55,480
had physical contact,

494
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:58,599
would you feel butterflies?

495
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:01,880
No, I wouldn't. I wouldn't be nervous.

496
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,200
My heart beats normally.

497
00:42:03,200 --> 00:42:05,060
How come?

498
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:07,239
Don't lie to me. Tell the truth.

499
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:09,720
I'm telling the truth.

500
00:42:09,720 --> 00:42:10,740
You better get back to your homework.

501
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,840
Don't lie to me.

502
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:14,639
If you don't explain things clearly to me,

503
00:42:14,639 --> 00:42:16,039
how am I supposed to help you on this?

504
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:33,376
Does it hurt?

505
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,880
My trust in you has never changed.

506
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:43,239
I think you should restore your timeline

507
00:42:44,880 --> 00:42:46,559
to a normal life,

508
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,920
like that of a sprout,

509
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,599
so that those who care about you
won't feel sad.

510
00:43:04,324 --> 00:43:08,804
♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫

511
00:43:10,724 --> 00:43:15,328
♫ The heart gradually silences ♫

512
00:43:16,708 --> 00:43:23,296
♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫

513
00:43:23,296 --> 00:43:28,384
♫ I can't delete them ♫

514
00:43:29,444 --> 00:43:35,456
♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫

515
00:43:35,456 --> 00:43:42,336
♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫

516
00:43:42,336 --> 00:43:50,784
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

517
00:43:51,620 --> 00:43:55,616
♫ Fading away ♫

518
00:43:56,772 --> 00:44:03,264
♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫

519
00:44:03,264 --> 00:44:09,632
♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫

520
00:44:11,108 --> 00:44:17,984
♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫

521
00:44:17,984 --> 00:44:22,336
♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫

522
00:44:22,336 --> 00:44:28,704
♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫

523
00:44:28,704 --> 00:44:35,456
♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫

524
00:44:35,456 --> 00:44:42,784
♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫

525
00:44:42,784 --> 00:44:52,384
♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫
