I think your relationship with Chen Mobai

It doesn't matter

May I ask what makes you so confident?

106
00:09:14,799 --> 00:09:16,659
This is a cross-section of the brain.

107
00:09:16,659 --> 00:09:19,740
This is the primary motor cortex
of the central anterior gyrus in the brain,

108
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:21,759
which is responsible for controlling movement.

109
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:23,920
Here is the anterior cingulate cortex,

110
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,059

111
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,900
The emotional issues you worry about will not affect Chen Mobai

I don't know whether you have heard of
something called paradox.

118

The paradox of emotion and reason.

119
00:09:57,560 --> 00:10:02,300
Formula racing is originally the fastest sport on earth.

120
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:05,719
Its safety and speed are
inherently contradictory.

121
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,900
Just like the relationship
between racers and engineers

122
00:10:07,919 --> 00:10:10,720
should be purely contractual.

123
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,860
They should learn about each other

124
00:10:12,860 --> 00:10:15,979
and maintain a dangerous contradiction.

125
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,760
But if there is something uncontrollable in between,

126
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,840

As an engineer, I've lost some very important people.

140

What I can do now is at least not to let anyone

is him, isn't it?

144
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:47,040
You see, human emotions are the most complex things in the world.

145
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,920
They can't be controlled, and there's no way to measure them.

Chen Mobai is the same.

147
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:56,200
I've known him for over a decade,

148

and he had never said the word 'tired',

149
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:04,360
but today, for you, he took all the responsibility.

150
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,779
The paradox is mutual.

151
00:12:07,779 --> 00:12:09,996
He cares about you,

152
00:12:09,996 --> 00:12:12,759
so he doesn't want to make you worry.

153
00:12:12,759 --> 00:12:16,056
You also care about him, so you can't let go.

154
00:12:16,056 --> 00:12:18,659
You can't let him run as fast as he can.

155

Even if this paradox is true,

156
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:28,460
I believe that as long as there's a problem, there must be an answer.

00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:44,019
Mitsui Taku and Lu Yunhao also ran the Linhai track this afternoon.

179
00:14:44,019 --> 00:14:48,680
And both of their latest lap times surpassed the record you just broke.

180
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:52,052
And it's considerably exceeded.

181
00:14:52,052 --> 00:14:54,380
Impossible.

182
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:57,259
Are they playing some kind of
psychological tactic?

183
00:14:57,259 --> 00:15:00,468
It's not psychological tactics. It's actual strength.

184
00:15:00,468 --> 00:15:03,940
I heard they always wanted to invite an expert from Europe,

185
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,680
and this expert has agreed to teach them recently.

186
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:09,159
It's only been a few days,

187
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,500
and this kind of result has been achieved.

188
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:18,839
I am just giving you a heads up.

189
00:15:18,839 --> 00:15:20,812
Don't think too much.

190
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,304
Don't worry. Strong enemies make you stronger.

191
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,352
It actually motivates us more.

192
00:15:32,352 --> 00:15:34,336
Go to sleep

193
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,540
I can definitely debug the perfect data.

194
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,788
For the first stop,

195
00:16:10,840 --> 00:16:13,040
that's my tactical plan. 
 [Ningwan Station]

196
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,948
Any objections?

197
00:16:14,948 --> 00:16:17,519
Why is it only us attending
such an important meeting?

198
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,520
Where is Xi?

199
00:16:19,520 --> 00:16:21,544
She went back to adjust the data.

200
00:16:22,799 --> 00:16:25,259
Wait. You guys, what's happening?

201
00:16:25,259 --> 00:16:27,879
Backing off before the competition?

202
00:16:29,159 --> 00:16:31,220
Is it because you heard
they increased their speed?

203
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:33,984
- Did that scare you? 
 - We are not scared.

204
00:16:33,984 --> 00:16:37,160
We just feel that the difficulty of the competition has increased

205
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:39,920
which means it is even more difficult
to win the championship.

206
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,900
As the saying goes, full steam ahead initially,

207
00:16:43,900 --> 00:16:46,440
decreased afterwards, exhausted at the end.

208
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:48,300
If you think I might be overwhelmed,

209
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,799
I can ensure you all that I won't be.

210
00:16:51,799 --> 00:16:56,100
On the battlefield, to become the strongest,

211
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:58,959
one must defeat those stronger.

212
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,240
Okay. Ningwan Station.

213
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:04,940
First battle victory. Come on.

214
00:17:06,279 --> 00:17:07,640
Skyfall!

215
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:17,419
Well done, Mobai. You did great today.

216
00:17:17,419 --> 00:17:19,939
In our first Formula A race,
we got second place.

217
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:22,599
This is called a good start,
winning at the starting line.

218
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:25,472
Come on

219
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:28,768
Where's Shen Xi?

220
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:35,840
Push it in.

221
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:02,944
Is it fun?

222
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:07,776
What?

223
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,376
Wind.

224
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,088
Do you feel it?

225
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:21,632
I feel it.

226
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:25,839
Your hands are chilled by the wind.

227
00:18:27,960 --> 00:18:29,480
Miss Shen, we are from Daily Sports.

228
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:30,528
we want to know that after two years,

229
00:18:30,528 --> 00:18:31,580
how do you feel returning to the track?

230
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:32,880
We're from Weekly Magazine. Do you--

231
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:35,340
Excuse me. The race will start soon.

232
00:18:35,340 --> 00:18:36,720
If you want an interview,

233
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,299
it will be arranged
by the organizing committee after the race.

234
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:39,560
Could you please answer me?

235
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:40,700
Could you please say something?

236
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,839
We have an exclusive interview.

237
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,300
Why are there suddenly so many media?

238
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:47,559
It's okay. There's nothing to fear. We're here.

239
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,480
Chen Mobai.

240
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,720
Are you busy dating?

241
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:57,400
People talk about having it all.
Both love and career.

242
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:00,680
Why do I feel that Mobai's career is
not going smoothly,

243
00:19:00,680 --> 00:19:03,200
so he can only focus on love?

244
00:19:07,319 --> 00:19:09,680
Why do I smell jealousy?

245
00:19:10,279 --> 00:19:11,880
Do you mean I'm jealous of you? About what?

246
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:14,959
Jealous that your test-driving record
was broken by me.

247
00:19:14,959 --> 00:19:16,680
You are jealous of my good mentality, right?

248
00:19:17,519 --> 00:19:19,600
Unlike some people. After losing their ranking,

249
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:21,280
they quickly come to blabber.

250
00:19:21,280 --> 00:19:22,799
Chen Mobai, what are you talking about?

251
00:19:23,559 --> 00:19:24,672
Who is this?

252
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:28,000
Isn't this the manager of the Satellite team?

253
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:31,260
You're relying on
Takano's technology and coaching.

254
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:32,559
You'd better stay low-key.

255
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,880
Chen Mobai, don't be so arrogant.

256
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,359
Isn't she just a Super Grand Prix engineer?

257
00:19:37,960 --> 00:19:38,960
If you lose this time,

258
00:19:39,519 --> 00:19:40,780
you will not only embarrass yourself

259
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:41,840
but also others.

260
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:44,799
Good racers speak through their engines.

261
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:51,599
Xi, ignore them.

262
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:53,984
I'm fine.

263
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,200
The race will start in the afternoon.

264
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,096
Aren't you preparing?

265
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:13,160
It's not psychological tactics.
It's actual strength.

266
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:15,900
I heard they always wanted to invite an expert

267
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:16,960
from Europe,

268
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:20,359
and this expert
has agreed to teach them recently.

269
00:20:23,960 --> 00:20:25,799
So you're that so-called secret weapon.

270
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,096
Chen Mobai.

271
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,640
It's our first time meeting on the field.

272
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:34,559
I'm honored to have an opponent like you.

273
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:39,968
Since you decide to come this time,

274
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:41,880
it shows

275
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,759
how important this is to you.

276
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,960
Don't worry.

277
00:20:45,960 --> 00:20:47,839
I will definitely cherish this honor.

278
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,599
Confidence is the best state.

279
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:00,576
The capital of confidence

280
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,432
is knowing that you will win.

281
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,359
Okay. Wish you luck.

282
00:21:15,332 --> 00:21:18,020
[The first Grand Prix of Formula A]

283
00:21:28,759 --> 00:21:30,080
In the just-concluded first Grand Prix

284
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:33,079
of Formula A at Ningwan,

285
00:21:33,599 --> 00:21:35,190
as the reigning champion of
the Formula B championship,

286
00:21:35,190 --> 00:21:36,780
Chen Mobai of Ruifeng Race Team

287
00:21:36,780 --> 00:21:39,120
spent most of the time in the leading position

288
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,600
and was expected to become a dark horse.

289
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,060
However, a serious mistake occurred
in the last lap,

290
00:21:43,060 --> 00:21:44,340
[Ningwan Station of the first Grand Prix of Formula A]
causing him to lose the race.

291
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:46,919
Ultimately, he lost to the defending champion
Mitsui Taku

292
00:21:46,919 --> 00:21:48,599
and received second place in the full event.

293
00:21:49,319 --> 00:21:50,432
Are you looking for me?

294
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,416
Take a seat.

295
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,279
I also watched the Ningwan station race.

296
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:08,992
It's a pity.

297
00:22:15,319 --> 00:22:17,599
It's normal to lose and win games.

298
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:20,279
It's my first time doing Formula A.

299
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:22,839
I may need some time to get used to it.

300
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:25,720
I heard the coach of Takano

301
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,559
and Junda is Markus's racer,

302
00:22:28,279 --> 00:22:29,480
who is also Shen Xi's friend.

303
00:22:30,680 --> 00:22:32,100
Is that why?

304
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:33,240
No. Not at all.

305
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,359
Don't let your mind run wild.

306
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,200
It has nothing to do with Shen Xi.

307
00:22:40,039 --> 00:22:42,359
Many people in the company
are looking at your scores,

308
00:22:43,359 --> 00:22:45,720
hoping it can bring a turning point
for this price war,

309
00:22:47,839 --> 00:22:48,960
but I don't want to pressure you.

310
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:51,640
I called you over today

311
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:55,319
just to tell you it's not easy to get here.

312
00:22:56,319 --> 00:22:57,920
No matter what,

313
00:23:00,440 --> 00:23:02,079
do not let down those who support you

314
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:04,720
and do not let yourself down.

315
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,599
If you decide to do it, do your best.

316
00:23:19,079 --> 00:23:20,160
I got it.

317
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,519
Did you call me here just for this?

318
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,336
It's just the first stop.

319
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:28,448
In the next one,

320
00:23:29,319 --> 00:23:30,359
I'll bring back the championship for you.

321
00:23:32,599 --> 00:23:33,696
Gotta go.

322
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:51,839
Mobai, what did Miss Mofei say to you?

323
00:23:54,079 --> 00:23:55,168
What could it be?

324
00:23:59,519 --> 00:24:01,120
- Come here.
- What are you doing?

325
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,144
I have something to tell you.

326
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,720
Don't drag me. Just say it.

327
00:24:15,279 --> 00:24:17,400
Did Mofei call you there to blame you?

328
00:24:19,200 --> 00:24:20,799
It's not that serious,
just a couple of reminders.

329
00:24:22,359 --> 00:24:23,392
She's under her own pressure too.

330
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:26,960
What was going on with you on the last lap?

331
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:31,160
You could have done well on the last lap.

332
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:32,519
Why did you let Mitsui Taku overtake you?

333
00:24:35,839 --> 00:24:37,632
I just wanted to win a satisfying victory

334
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,860
in front of Lin Shaoqian.

335
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,160
I didn't expect to make a mistake.

336
00:24:40,160 --> 00:24:41,640
Shut up.

337
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,039
The race god will never make mistakes
on the track

338
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:45,480
because of Lin Shaoqian.

339
00:24:46,640 --> 00:24:48,359
I did hesitate at that moment

340
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:50,279
and missed the best opportunity.

341
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:53,079
I wanted to catch up later, but I couldn't.

342
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,072
What's your name?

343
00:24:58,559 --> 00:24:59,920
Chen Mobai, what's wrong with you?

344
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,279
Listen to yourself.

345
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,200
Did you say you were worried and you hesitated?

346
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,119
Is this the style of you, race god?

347
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,952
We must concentrate completely on track,
no distractions allowed.

348
00:25:09,952 --> 00:25:11,008
Isn't this what you taught me?

349
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,160
Don't blame me for speaking bluntly.

350
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,720
Our burden is heavy.

351
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,599
Miss Mofei has put everything into this time.

352
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:33,640
If you continue to be fearful and hesitant,

353
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:36,119
you're letting everyone down.

354
00:25:38,759 --> 00:25:39,872
No, I won't.

355
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,072
I guarantee it won't happen next time.

356
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:01,299
I think your relationship with Chen Mobai

357
00:26:01,299 --> 00:26:03,200
has already affected the race.

358
00:26:05,799 --> 00:26:07,759
I can't let myself affect his state.

359
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:10,119
I must give him positive emotions.

360
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,416
Blistering

361
00:26:21,119 --> 00:26:22,520
refers to the situation where overheated tires

362
00:26:22,520 --> 00:26:24,039
are driven on roads with lower temperatures,

363
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:26,179
causing the tire rubber to separate
from the tire surface.

364
00:26:26,179 --> 00:26:27,359
It's called blistering.

365
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:29,240
Grainy typically refers to

366
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:31,220
the phenomenon in which a supercooled tire

367
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:32,839
travels on a hot surface

368
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,740
and the tire rubber instantly cools

369
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,939
and is left on the tire,

370
00:26:35,939 --> 00:26:38,380
resulting in

371
00:26:38,380 --> 00:26:40,500
reduced tire life

372
00:26:40,500 --> 00:26:42,260
and decreased grip.

373
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,559
The last stop was in Ningwan.

374
00:26:43,559 --> 00:26:45,119
You all achieved impressive results.

375
00:26:45,759 --> 00:26:46,784
But at the next stop,

376
00:26:47,599 --> 00:26:48,680
Ruifeng will go all out.

377
00:26:49,720 --> 00:26:51,220
We didn't win the championship last time,

378
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,359
but there were also gains.

379
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:55,440
Everyone has adapted to Formula A
and gained experience.

380
00:26:56,799 --> 00:26:59,319
Starting from this stop at Changlu,

381
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:00,920
we need to reach a higher level.

382
00:27:00,920 --> 00:27:02,119
In the upcoming races,

383
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:04,319
if you want to keep winning,

384
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:05,599
you have to use your brain.

385
00:27:06,680 --> 00:27:08,640
Mitsui, this is your advantage.

386
00:27:09,839 --> 00:27:12,119
Lu Yunhao, you need to be careful this time.

387
00:27:12,759 --> 00:27:14,839
Maintain a clear mind. Make accurate judgments

388
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:18,160
Chen Mobai,
the most important thing is your mental state.

389
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,816
I admit that

390
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,440
there were some issues with the previous match,

391
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,900
but I earnestly ask you all to believe in me.

392
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,240
I am ready.

393
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:37,472
This time,

394
00:27:38,119 --> 00:27:39,559
it absolutely won't happen again.

395
00:27:41,119 --> 00:27:42,208
I also believe that

396
00:27:43,160 --> 00:27:44,240
we will definitely

397
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:46,919
take back our championship.

398
00:27:46,919 --> 00:27:48,440
Yes! Yes!

399
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:52,919
As long as everyone takes it to heart.

400
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:55,160
Strategic explanation will start tomorrow

401
00:27:57,480 --> 00:27:58,560
Excuse me.

402
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,680
You guys can discuss it with each other.
The class is finished.

403
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:04,224
Hello, Nick.

404
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:09,440
Is that true?

405
00:28:11,839 --> 00:28:13,680
That's fantastic. I will tell her immediately.

406
00:28:14,208 --> 00:28:15,280
Alright.

407
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:16,599
Based on the experience of the last match,

408
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:20,519
there will definitely be a mad first lap
this time too.

409
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:23,160
The circuit will be very crowded
at the start of the race.

410
00:28:23,799 --> 00:28:24,800
So--

411
00:28:25,359 --> 00:28:26,432
Hello.

412
00:28:30,119 --> 00:28:31,200
Xi.

413
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:33,664
Shaoqian.

414
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:35,360
Why are you here?

415
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:36,384
Excuse me.

416
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,080
I have something important

417
00:28:39,319 --> 00:28:40,480
to discuss with Xi alone.

418
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:44,880
Why can't you discuss the matter here?

419
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,839
It concerns her life choices.

420
00:29:02,212 --> 00:29:07,652
[Countdown 1 day]

421
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:21,824
This is what happened.

422
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,039
Is this true?

423
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:36,720
This is due to the advent of new technology.

424
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,359
I was able to find that loophole.

425
00:29:45,359 --> 00:29:48,080
Regarding what happened

426
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,780
to our driver, Shen Chuan,

427
00:29:51,780 --> 00:29:54,759
two years ago,

428
00:29:56,519 --> 00:29:57,600
the team

429
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,359
recently used the new technology

430
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:03,119
and conducted a re-investigation.

431
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:05,240
It has now been found

432
00:30:05,960 --> 00:30:08,120
the cause of the accident

433
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:11,220
was not the Wings of Wind's

434
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,000
[Markus Releases Latest Investigation on Shen Chuan's Accident]
design problem

435
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:19,160
but a mechanic assembly error,

436
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,559
resulting in the failure
of the adjustable rear wing part

437
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:24,799
when entering a high-speed corner,

438
00:30:25,599 --> 00:30:28,119
which caused the body to lose control. Here,

439
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,920
we solemnly apologize to

440
00:30:30,920 --> 00:30:35,160
Shen Xi, the designer of Wings of Wind

441
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:38,660
for the pressure she had to endure
in these two years

442
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:41,559
and the unjust treatment.

443
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:44,000
So Markus is coming out to clear the air.

444
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:45,959
Little master was really wronged.

445
00:30:45,959 --> 00:30:47,740
I told you so. Xi is the best.

446
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:49,400
Great. Now the media finally can't

447
00:30:49,400 --> 00:30:50,480
bother us.

448
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:55,039
Thank you for everything you've done
for me and my brother.

449
00:30:57,799 --> 00:30:59,559
No need to be so polite between us,

450
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,000
but as for my suggestion just now,

451
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:04,880
you must consider it carefully.

452
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:07,000
It's a really rare opportunity.

453
00:31:11,319 --> 00:31:12,839
This is your once dream.

454
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,480
In order to express our sincerity,

455
00:31:19,160 --> 00:31:22,140
we have decided to cordially invite

456
00:31:22,140 --> 00:31:25,460
Wings of Wind's designer, Shen Xi

457
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:28,440
to return to Markus.

458
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:31,319
We will build a brand new team

459
00:31:31,319 --> 00:31:33,180
around her

460
00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:36,319
to inject new vitality

461
00:31:36,319 --> 00:31:38,319
to the Super Grand Prix racing field.

462
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:44,256
What does this mean?

463
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:45,880
Return to Markus?

464
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,040
Little Master is going to leave, right?

465
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,440
That's the Super Grand Prix.

466
00:31:50,119 --> 00:31:52,460
Markus even said they wanted to
build her a dedicated team.

467
00:31:52,460 --> 00:31:53,659
Who would not be happy to get this?

468
00:31:53,659 --> 00:31:54,816
What are you talking about?

469
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,880
That's all wishful thinking of the Germans.

470
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:58,880
Shen Xi will not go.

471
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:01,820
Lin Shaoqian came here just to take Shen Xi,
didn't he?

472
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:04,200
Do you think he has more charm than Mobai?

473
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,759
Hurry up and prepare for the competition.

474
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,752
Xi,

475
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:13,952
you should know that

476
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,319
it's all in the past now.

477
00:32:18,440 --> 00:32:19,520
It's not your fault.

478
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:27,136
Give yourself some time.

479
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,088
Think about it.

480
00:32:32,599 --> 00:32:33,600
See you.

481
00:32:43,319 --> 00:32:44,659
I have something else to do.

482
00:32:44,659 --> 00:32:47,079
Guys, come on. Help me. Let's go.

483
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:00,880
I saw it on TV earlier.

484
00:33:03,200 --> 00:33:04,288
Congratulations.

485
00:33:07,968 --> 00:33:09,000
Let me drive you home.

486
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,000
Anyways, I've finished
what I've had to explain to Xu Gong.

487
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:13,696
It's okay.

488
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:16,079
Just focus on preparing for the competition.

489
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,519
Have a good rest today.

490
00:33:25,240 --> 00:33:26,839
Don't forget to share this good news
with your mom.

491
00:33:28,359 --> 00:33:29,472
We will meet at the airport tomorrow.

492
00:33:36,279 --> 00:33:37,280
See you tomorrow.

493
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,979
We have decided to cordially invite

494
00:34:07,979 --> 00:34:11,299
Wings of Wind's designer, Shen Xi

495
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,280
to return to Markus.

496
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,360
We will build a brand new team

497
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:19,000
around her

498
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,760
to inject new vitality

499
00:34:22,760 --> 00:34:24,599
to the Super Grand Prix racing field.

500
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:35,280
Feeling like this before the race

501
00:34:35,920 --> 00:34:37,024
is not a good thing.

502
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,519
I feel pretty good.

503
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:42,800
Catching the evening breeze here

504
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:44,864
helps me relax.

505
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,039
Regarding whether Shen Xi will return
to Markus,

506
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,359
you should have a good chat with her.

507
00:34:50,359 --> 00:34:51,440
Wouldn't that be better to make it clear?

508
00:34:56,519 --> 00:34:57,568
What should I say?

509
00:35:00,199 --> 00:35:01,248
Just tell her

510
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,119
Markus is great

511
00:35:03,679 --> 00:35:04,960
and the Super Grand Prix is also great,

512
00:35:05,679 --> 00:35:07,840
but her life here is also excellent.

513
00:35:08,719 --> 00:35:10,560
She has a team, friends,

514
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,639
and life, plus a lot more.

515
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,400
Do you think it's fair to her
if I gaslight her like this?

516
00:35:20,199 --> 00:35:23,320
We've been going all out for the chance
to compete in the Super Grand Prix.

517
00:35:25,159 --> 00:35:28,079
Now she has the opportunity to pursue
her own dream.

518
00:35:30,639 --> 00:35:31,680
Should I stop her?

519
00:35:35,639 --> 00:35:36,704
Besides, you've heard it too.

520
00:35:37,599 --> 00:35:39,480
Markus will reform the technical team

521
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:42,719
centering around her.

522
00:35:43,760 --> 00:35:45,260
Allow her to lead more people.

523
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:46,760
Go after the Super Grand Prix.

524
00:35:49,679 --> 00:35:51,440
This is her and Chuan's dream.

525
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,180
Changlu Station of the first Grand Prix
of Formula A.

526
00:36:02,180 --> 00:36:03,860
Mitsui Taku of the Takano team

527
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:06,120
retrieved the feeling of being a champion
in his homeland.

528
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,679
He led the race from pole position all the way
to the finish line.

529
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:11,400
Whereas Chen Mobai from Ruifeng Race Team

530
00:36:11,400 --> 00:36:12,980
tried his best in pursuit

531
00:36:12,980 --> 00:36:14,880
but found his performance affected
because of the pressure.

532
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,880
Consequently, he was overtaken by Lu Yunhao
from the Junda team.

533
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:23,280
He won points in the top three
for two consecutive seasons.

534
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,120
It was supposed to be a good result,

535
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:26,700
but during the domestic races, Chen Mobai

536
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,719
[Changlu Station of the Grand Prix saw the speed]
is renowned for his exceptional talent.

537
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:31,940
He is now competing
in the Asian large-scale races.

538
00:36:31,940 --> 00:36:33,940
Ruifeng Race Team's chief engineer

539
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,119
is the former key member of
Markus technical team, Shen Xi.

540
00:36:37,639 --> 00:36:38,950
When such strong alliances were formed,

541
00:36:38,950 --> 00:36:41,559
the outside world of course will
have higher expectations for them.

542
00:36:41,559 --> 00:36:44,384
♫ Fading away ♫

543
00:36:46,052 --> 00:36:51,584
♫ I would like to help you race fast ♫

544
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:57,239
♫ And hope that all is well with you ♫

545
00:36:57,239 --> 00:36:59,559
At this moment, I really want to help him.

546
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,760
I'm trying to find the perfect data,

547
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:06,119
but I'm becoming more and more irrational.

548
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:12,480
Maybe, just like what Zhao Yingning said.

549
00:37:13,400 --> 00:37:15,119
The relationship between the engineer

550
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,800
and the racer is originally very pure.

551
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:21,159
It's me who surpassed its boundaries

552
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:23,679
and made it impure.

553
00:37:23,679 --> 00:37:26,464
♫ Is your pride ♫

554
00:37:26,464 --> 00:37:28,704
♫ And also ♫

555
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:32,800
♫ My prayer for your safety ♫

556
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:33,888
Shen Xi,

557
00:37:35,360 --> 00:37:36,384
what's wrong with you?

558
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,159
They say you're not eating.

559
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:41,184
Wait for me.

560
00:37:49,480 --> 00:37:50,528
What's this?

561
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:53,400
You've been working on this all this time.

562
00:37:55,199 --> 00:37:56,288
What's it for?

563
00:37:58,239 --> 00:38:01,159
To find a solution, perhaps.

564
00:38:02,039 --> 00:38:03,104
A solution to what?

565
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,040
How to separate one part of the brain

566
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,679
from another.

567
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:12,384
What do you mean?

568
00:38:30,800 --> 00:38:31,880
Have you heard of a paradox?

569
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,519
Paradox is a concept in logic and mathematics

570
00:38:39,520 --> 00:38:40,640
that usually refers to

571
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:42,760
deriving two opposing conclusions

572
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,519
based on commonly accepted reasoning.

573
00:38:45,119 --> 00:38:46,480
It's like this.

574
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:49,559
If event A occurs, then it leads to non-A,

575
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:53,239
and if non-A occurs, then it leads to A.

576
00:38:56,440 --> 00:38:57,472
So…

577
00:39:02,360 --> 00:39:03,780
Perhaps between you and me,

578
00:39:03,780 --> 00:39:05,159
there exists such a paradox.

579
00:39:07,239 --> 00:39:08,288
As a racer,

580
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:10,559
you should pursue better results.

581
00:39:12,719 --> 00:39:13,760
As an engineer,

582
00:39:15,039 --> 00:39:18,000
I should also fulfill
all your professional requirements,

583
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,300
but now because of our relationship,

584
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:24,760
it's very difficult for us to do so.

585
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:30,679
You were right before.

586
00:39:34,719 --> 00:39:35,776
I am really worried about you.

587
00:39:41,079 --> 00:39:42,840
I don't know when it started,

588
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:47,000
but I feel scared.

589
00:39:51,679 --> 00:39:53,400
I fear any slight possibility
of you being in danger.

590
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:57,408
It seems like,

591
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,920
I have transcended the role of an engineer.

592
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,239
I can no longer

593
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,480
overcome my safety concerns and fully
focus on enhancing your speed.

594
00:40:12,199 --> 00:40:14,719
Every time, I am the one who has to personally
get you on the racetrack.

595
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,159
To have speed or safety,

596
00:40:20,679 --> 00:40:21,800
it is an inherent paradox.

597
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:34,944
Do you think

598
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,240
we can somehow

599
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:43,159
find a perfect balance in this paradox?

600
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:47,200
Yes.

601
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:53,536
I think we can.

602
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:14,199
It's too hot here. Let's go down.

603
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:58,180
♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫

604
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,704
♫ The heart gradually silences ♫

605
00:42:06,084 --> 00:42:12,672
♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫

606
00:42:12,672 --> 00:42:17,760
♫ I can't delete them ♫

607
00:42:18,820 --> 00:42:24,832
♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫

608
00:42:24,832 --> 00:42:31,712
♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫

609
00:42:31,712 --> 00:42:40,160
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

610
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:44,992
♫ Fading away ♫

611
00:42:46,148 --> 00:42:52,640
♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫

612
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:59,008
♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫

613
00:43:00,484 --> 00:43:07,360
♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫

614
00:43:07,360 --> 00:43:11,712
♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫

615
00:43:11,712 --> 00:43:18,080
♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫

616
00:43:18,080 --> 00:43:24,832
♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫

617
00:43:24,832 --> 00:43:32,160
♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫

618
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:41,760
♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫
