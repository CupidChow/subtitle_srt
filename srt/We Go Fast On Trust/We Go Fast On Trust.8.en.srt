Yes, the car is fine.

Yes.

38
00:02:51,479 --> 00:02:53,320
I still hate to see you drive a race car.

I know you didn't buy in the drivers.

50
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,000
I misunderstood you.

51
00:03:37,088 --> 00:03:38,140
Because I got misunderstood by you,

52
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:40,032
so I know how bad it is to be misunderstood.

53
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,880

it must obey the arrangement of the company.

You still don't trust me, do you?

64
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:11,320

00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,319
I told you I wouldn't force you to do anything,

I still want you to be my engineer

The requirements of vehicle technology
for racing cars

153

It embodies the cutting-edge technology
of the car company.

155
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,000
And the speed of the race team also
represents the hard power of the car company.

00:12:05,899 --> 00:12:07,640
<i>[Invincible Takano, Asian Racing King]</i>
Mitsui Taku, who you've been wanting to challenge.

184
00:12:07,640 --> 00:12:10,300
He has set records of lap time on Linglu,

185
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:12,639
Zhongnan and Linhai speedway.

186
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:14,840
How did they do that?

187
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:16,480
When you were mad at Miss Mofei,

188
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,960
they were busy.

189
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,520
I told you before.

190
00:12:19,520 --> 00:12:22,399
Takano arranged special training
for Mitsui in Markus.

191
00:12:22,919 --> 00:12:24,120
This is the result of special training.

192
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,180
They are doing crazy

193
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:28,479
to build an invincible racing team.

194
00:12:28,479 --> 00:12:30,960
If they are, then I don't sit idle anymore.

195
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,339
If they speed up, I speed up too.
We have nothing to worry.

196
00:12:34,339 --> 00:12:35,880
At the Formula A,

197
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,920
it's no use relying on the driver alone.

198
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,120
Teams matter.

199
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:40,840
Get to the point.

200
00:12:41,960 --> 00:12:43,140
You know best about your men.

201
00:12:43,140 --> 00:12:44,480
your men.

202
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:47,960
The former Ruifeng junior technician, Xu Gong.

203
00:12:48,879 --> 00:12:50,560
<i>[SKYFALL Member Profile]</i>
Although the competition is not about degrees,

204
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,360
you can't ignore it at all, right?

205
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:54,360
<i>[SKYFALL Member Profile]</i>
The former Internet cafe administrator, Hou Jian.

206
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:56,260
You don't think that someone who
plays video games and has a driver's license

207
00:12:56,260 --> 00:12:58,380
will help you do the data, right?

208
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,279
The most absurd one, Lu Dayong,

209
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:01,779
<i>[SKYFALL member profile]</i>
the former masseur at a foot massage shop.

210
00:13:01,779 --> 00:13:03,820
Do you really think they can
get you in the Formula A competition?

211
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:05,540
Miss Zhao, we can explain.

212
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:06,919
No need.

213
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,279
And you don't even have

214
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:09,740
a qualified race engineer.

215
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,080
Who says so?

216
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,679
She just hasn't arrived yet.

217
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,919
Give me some time and I can figure it out.

218
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,120
Or I'll help you figure it out.

219
00:13:18,639 --> 00:13:20,240
Thierry Philippe,

220
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,120
has engaged in racing more than two decades,

221
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:24,360
has served in multiple formula racing teams

222
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:25,559
as a senior race engineer.

223
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,000
I've had our partners in France

224
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,120
do the contact.

225
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,600
As long as Ruifeng gets things ready,

226
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,559
he can be here with a team right away.

227
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,799
Miss Zhao, the team is backed by Ruifeng.

228
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:38,900
We have thousands of engineers

229
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,200
and hundreds of experts in fluid mechanics
and engines in our R&D center,

230
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,440
I think we should have no problem

231
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,360
finding a race engineer
who meets your requirements.

232
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:50,120
As for the professional level
of the current members,

233
00:13:50,879 --> 00:13:53,039
we also have a comprehensive
technical training system.

234
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,039
I think the freedom in personnel appointment

235
00:13:56,799 --> 00:13:58,279
should be returned to Ruifeng.

236
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:00,440
After all, you just want a result.

237
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:02,879
We are sure to give you a satisfactory one.

238
00:14:03,584 --> 00:14:04,736
Right.

239
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,260
Don't you always care about results?

240
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,519
Pre-season testing is a month away at Linhai.

241
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:11,440
I promise

242
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,799
I will break Mitsui Taku's record.

243
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,072
If not,

244
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:16,896
I am willing to drop out.

245
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,759
Looks like you are already on the same side.

246
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,159
As long as you remember that Ruifeng,

247
00:14:24,159 --> 00:14:26,040
whether it is the financial report
or the stock price,

248
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:28,080
cannot afford a failed promise.

249
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,540
This is way too big.

250
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:47,339
This is the kind of environment
a big race team should have.

251
00:14:47,339 --> 00:14:48,448
Hello.

252
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:02,200
Xu Gong, their uniforms are really cool.

253
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,360
Am I going to wear this in the future too?

254
00:15:04,679 --> 00:15:07,600
I want to put a massage bed here.
It would be awesome.

255
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:08,800
Wait. With such a big space,

256
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,920
shouldn't you put more things?

257
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:12,940
Everything came too suddenly.

258
00:15:12,940 --> 00:15:15,880
I don't know if we have any luck to enjoy it.

259
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,159
Don't talk like that.

260
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,224
Today,

261
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,879
you suddenly spoke up
for me for the first time.

262
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:27,200
I just don't like it when someone
questions Ruifeng's capabilities.

263
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,480
Anyway, big words have already been said.

264
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,224
If you can't do it,

265
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:34,480
you and I will both have to leave.

266
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:50,080
Mobai.

267
00:15:51,240 --> 00:15:52,240
M-Mobai is here.

268
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:54,976
Mobai.

269
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,559
Don't worry, your salaries
from Ruifeng are secured.

270
00:16:02,679 --> 00:16:03,680
None of you can get away.

271
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:07,584
Don't get too excited.

272
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:10,080
He made a promise.

273
00:16:10,799 --> 00:16:12,660
We either break the record or we leave.

274
00:16:12,660 --> 00:16:14,579
It's normal. We just got here,

275
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,920
- we should achieve something.
- That's true.

276
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:18,240
Mobai, which track?

277
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:19,580
What's the target?

278
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:21,039
A month later, at the Linhai speedway,

279
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:23,159
1:31,653.

280
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,000
What?

281
00:16:25,000 --> 00:16:26,880
Wait, I remember
the highest record of that track

282
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:29,820
is 1:33, right?

283
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:32,219
1:31,653 is a new record broken

284
00:16:32,219 --> 00:16:33,280
by Mitsui Taku.

285
00:16:33,280 --> 00:16:35,620
Mitsui Taku is indeed the Asian Racing King,

286
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,260
faster two seconds.

287
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:40,039
It's so difficult for someone to be
faster even tenth of a second.

288
00:16:40,559 --> 00:16:41,820
It only took him only a month.

289
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,380
Indeed, he is pretty amazing.

290
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,280
Maybe we shouldn't stay here

291
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:46,464
to cause you trouble.

292
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,200
What are you saying?

293
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,799
It's not Skyfall's style to give in and run.

294
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,440
When we had nothing before,

295
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:57,639
have you ever been scared?

296
00:16:57,639 --> 00:16:59,200
Now Ruifeng scares you like this.

297
00:17:00,096 --> 00:17:01,200
Even if Ruifeng

298
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:02,599
will kick us out because of our inability,

299
00:17:02,599 --> 00:17:03,639
that's something in the future.

300
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,359
Before then,

301
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,519
don't you give in.

302
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:09,640
I've told you,

303
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:11,240
challenging the impossible
is the charm of racing.

304
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:13,760
Do you hear me?

305
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:14,840
Yes.

306
00:17:14,840 --> 00:17:15,872
So,

307
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:18,400
none of you could drop out.

308
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,720
- Do you hear me?
- Yes.

309
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:22,300
Do you hear me?

310
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,759
Yes.

Shaoqian, I've been a bit busy lately,

318
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,599
probably don't have time.

319
00:18:10,519 --> 00:18:11,616
Wish you all the best.

320
00:18:17,519 --> 00:18:19,200
Miss Mofei had HR do a preliminary screening,

321
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,120
the company has a total

322
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:22,559
of 115 engineers who meet the requirement.

323
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:24,736
You have plenty to choose from.

324
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:29,640
Mr. Zhang, has attended 985 institutions
for both his bachelor's and PhD degrees.

325
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,560
He's skilled at designing high-performance
engines and transmission systems,

326
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:33,640
with outstanding capabilities.

327
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:35,799
Miss Mofei thinks highly of him.

328
00:18:35,799 --> 00:18:36,864
He's not suitable.

329
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:38,799
My name is Alex.

330
00:18:39,680 --> 00:18:42,480
I'm a fluid dynamics engineer
who graduated from CalTech,

331
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,799
fluent in four languages.

332
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:45,472
He's not suitable.

333
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,599
Gao Yan.

334
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,980
His name reflects his high level of rigor.

335
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,104
There's nothing to criticize, right?

336
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,232
The hairstyle is too ugly.

337
00:18:56,359 --> 00:18:58,240
Ugly hairstyle means bad taste.

338
00:18:58,839 --> 00:19:00,640
He learned automotive design later.

339
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:02,400
Do you see what his undergraduate major was?

340
00:19:03,319 --> 00:19:05,359
Major of agricultural mechanization.

341
00:19:06,440 --> 00:19:08,240
His Chinese name is Ma Hu.
[*Ma Hu means carelessness in Chinese.]

342
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,740
How can a careless person

343
00:19:10,740 --> 00:19:12,680
handle something
as sophisticated as a race car?

344
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,440
He has a few grey hairs on his head.

345
00:19:16,039 --> 00:19:18,279
That means
he has a hot temper and great stress.

346
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,199
Do you think a car designed by someone
with such pressure and bad taste

347
00:19:21,199 --> 00:19:23,000
can look good?

348
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:26,160
Ruifeng's reputation would be ruined by then.

349
00:19:29,279 --> 00:19:30,464
Next.

350
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,899
There's a lot of people in and out.

351
00:19:32,899 --> 00:19:35,620
Mr. Mobai is recruiting
an engineer for his team.

352
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,839
Of course he'd make such a scene.

353
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:39,616
How do you know that?

354
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:42,039
I was the one who printed the profiles.

355
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:44,720
All these engineers

356
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,679
possess a master's or doctoral degree,

357
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:48,680
graduated from top schools.

358
00:19:49,359 --> 00:19:50,759
But what does an engineer do?

359
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,544
Build cars?

360
00:19:52,544 --> 00:19:55,232
I think it's more like a coach.

361
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,380
Team engineers are primarily
responsible for the design

362
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,080
and configuration
of vehicle technical components.

363
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,160
In some cases, they have to
instruct the drivers.

365
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:10,659
Shen Xi, this is the first time

00:20:10,659 --> 00:20:12,200
you join our conversation.

367
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:16,576

You're great.

No matter how great you are, you could
just be an executive like the rest of us

371
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:28,200
not in that conference room.

these days.

I have no choice.

00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:02,440
Are we still waiting for Shen Xi?

378
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:05,536
I still want to try again,

379
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,160
though Chen Mofei has issued an ultimatum.

380
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:10,880
I just really don't understand.

381
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:12,980
She's willing to give you a proposal,

382
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,799
but doesn't she come to join us?

383
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:20,400
I'll go find her. I'm leaving.

384
00:21:54,480 --> 00:21:55,552
Why are you here?

385
00:21:59,599 --> 00:22:00,768
Waiting the bus with you.

386
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:05,839
I heard that sweet things secrete

387

ampadol.

388
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:09,920
Do you want to try?

389
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:13,899
You're wrong. It's not ampadol, but dopamine.

390
00:22:13,899 --> 00:22:15,920
And no studies have shown

391
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:17,960
a direct link between dopamine and happiness.

392
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:21,039
I think you're talking about endorphins.

393
00:22:22,359 --> 00:22:23,480
Endorphins are something

394
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,720
that are released when you eat spicy food.

395
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:34,048
And?

396
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,920
With all that theory,
you might as well give it a try.

397
00:22:56,880 --> 00:22:58,319
Why didn't you come to the ceremony that day?

398
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:05,280

Don't underestimate this small creature,
it's valuable.

You can't delay it any longer.

462

Chen Mofei said she cared about the team,

463
00:27:09,319 --> 00:27:10,559
but we never saw her in selection.

464
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:14,319
She's been having stomachaches again lately.

I begged her to go check in the hospital.

466
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,080
She left with a couple of books

468
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,200
Mobai, I think you already
have someone in mind,

469
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,359
so you're not satisfied with anyone else.

00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,120
The company

471
00:27:29,839 --> 00:27:31,260

472
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,400
the perfect engineer you want in one step.

473
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:35,168
Why don't you tell me

474
00:27:35,680 --> 00:27:38,200
your requirement?

475
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,200
Since that person doesn't come,

476
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,119
then I want an engineer

477
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,640
who's aggressive and forceful.

478
00:27:51,400 --> 00:27:52,448
I have the right one for the job.

479
00:27:58,519 --> 00:28:01,120
I need you to fix this and that.

480
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:02,912
Okay.

481
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:09,680
Are you sure they hired

00:28:11,599 --> 00:28:12,759
a female engineer?

483
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:15,480
When did I, Hao Well-informed,
ever make a mistake?

484
00:28:16,279 --> 00:28:17,312
Surprise, right?

485
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:19,519
Could it be…

486
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,920
It's not Shen Xi, but

487
00:28:22,599 --> 00:28:26,720
I heard she's one of
the most powerful characters at Ruifeng.

488
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:30,440
And she used to be an engineer
at the international Rally.

489
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:34,479
Although it's different from

490
00:28:34,479 --> 00:28:37,500
the formula A.

491
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:39,000
But Miss Mofei said,

492
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,400
she is the perfect fit for our needs.

493
00:28:42,119 --> 00:28:43,640
Does Ruifeng have this kind of capable person?

494
00:28:46,319 --> 00:28:47,392
Let's go and meet her.

495
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:49,480
They say she will come.

496
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,240
Is she the surprise

498
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:08,960
Didn't you want

499
00:29:09,759 --> 00:29:11,079
someone who's aggressive and forceful?

500
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:15,400
I think she's too much.

501
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,248
Who is Chen Mobai?

00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,480
I'm Liu Qianqian from

510
00:29:43,200 --> 00:29:44,219
How much money do you owe?

511
00:29:44,219 --> 00:29:45,260
Why does the debt collector come again?

512
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:47,279
I thought my high school class teacher is here.

513
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,416
Let me introduce,

514
00:29:53,480 --> 00:29:55,000
this is Miss Liu.

515
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,599
She came to interview
for our engineer position.

516
00:29:58,319 --> 00:30:00,880
If you have any question,

517
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:04,160
go ask her now.

That's all?

519
00:30:06,319 --> 00:30:07,480
Is it a data sheet?

520
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,992
Who's the chief technician?

521
00:30:14,519 --> 00:30:15,552
You?

522
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,159
Give me a briefing about

523
00:30:18,159 --> 00:30:21,319
tire performance on different weather

524
00:30:21,839 --> 00:30:23,880
and ground temperature.

525
00:30:24,400 --> 00:30:26,240
What? What performance?

526
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,240
No one remember

527
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:30,640
such things after the race.

528
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,000
No one's ever remembered it before anyway.

529
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,799
So that's what makes you a chief technician?

530
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:37,680
Who would dare to drive the car you fix?

531
00:30:38,368 --> 00:30:39,460
I'd be surprised if the car doesn't turn over.

532
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:41,199
What did you say? Do you know the rules here?

533
00:30:41,199 --> 00:30:42,839
- We don't talk like that here.
- Monkey!

534
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:46,039
What's your problem? You're so incompetent,

535
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:48,559
I'd fire you long ago if you are my staff.

536
00:30:49,119 --> 00:30:50,119
- You!
- She's right.

537
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,200
Indeed, I am incompetent.

538
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,896
Stop there.

539
00:31:00,400 --> 00:31:02,080
What a fragile man!

540
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,240
What's the matter?

541
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,320
Can't I be sad for a while?

542
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,240
Practical operation
is the first way to improve.

543
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:11,140
You can do anything

544
00:31:11,140 --> 00:31:12,160
if you try and make mistakes.

545
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:14,752
Come here.

546
00:31:16,119 --> 00:31:17,184
Who's the data officer?

547
00:31:18,599 --> 00:31:20,000
Why don't you print the parameters
and file them?

548
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:22,599
And maintenance director,

549
00:31:24,288 --> 00:31:25,440
prepare the tools,

550
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,440
you'll disassemble it later.

551
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,599
I want to see how he adjusts.

552
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:34,839
What? Is it that hard? Let's move.

553
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:39,119
And you. Give me a clear answer
if you hire me or not.

554
00:31:39,680 --> 00:31:40,919
Don't hem and haw.

555
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:42,240
If you don't like me, I don't like you either.

556
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,744
I hope we can work well together.

557
00:31:56,640 --> 00:31:57,664
Come with me.

558
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,408
Get to work.

559
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:15,680
Faster.

560
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,759
I'm fast enough.

561
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,100
- Okay?
- Yes.

562
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:35,780
You're quite something.

563
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,928
You're not bad.

564
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:39,520
You're good.

565
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,672
You're better than me.

566
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:42,440
- Okay.
- You're good.

567
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,416
You!

568
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,759
Alright, alright.

569
00:32:57,559 --> 00:33:02,048
Now we have the right time,
right place, and right staff.

570
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:05,160
Tomorrow's test drive,

571
00:33:05,839 --> 00:33:08,560
let's create a miracle again, okay?

572
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:10,000
Okay.

573
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:14,119
Come on, let's cheer up.

574
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,920
- Come on.
- Come on.

575
00:33:18,440 --> 00:33:20,832
Three, two, one, go for it!

576
00:33:30,880 --> 00:33:31,920
It's truly Formula A.

577
00:33:33,319 --> 00:33:34,519
So cool.

578
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:38,160
So cool!

579
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,768
Look at the flow line.

580
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,759
It's a bit fancy.

581
00:33:44,599 --> 00:33:46,000
Well.

582
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:48,799
This Formula A car is pretty.

583
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:52,839
Liu Qianqian really gets it.

584
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:56,279
Xu Gong, doesn't your mom
push you to marry lately?

585
00:33:57,079 --> 00:33:58,599
What? Every day.

586
00:33:58,599 --> 00:34:00,219
I think you're having a good time

587
00:34:00,219 --> 00:34:03,136
with Miss Liu. Consider it.

588
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,839
I use electric screws,

589
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:10,559
while she just screws the screws by hand.

590
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:13,100
We're not even on the same level.

591
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,559
Would she even consider someone like me?

592
00:34:16,519 --> 00:34:17,664
What are you saying about me?

593
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:20,639
Follow this data.

594
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,400
Try your best in the experimental phase
of a new product.

595
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:26,719
Ask Mobai to give it a go.

596
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,159
Let's aim to surpass Mitsui Taku in one go.

597
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:31,280
Exactly.

598
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:32,320
Mobai.

599
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,139
I think we're just in time
for Mr. Mobai's test drive.

600
00:34:36,139 --> 00:34:37,248
Let's check it out.

601
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,639
Look at you.

602
00:35:08,280 --> 00:35:09,740
Mr. Mobai is about to take off.

603
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:11,400
Pretty cool.

604
00:35:13,519 --> 00:35:16,760
He is such a good man.

605
00:35:23,559 --> 00:35:25,659
W-What's going on here?

606
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,239
That's a fast first lap.

607
00:35:27,760 --> 00:35:30,199
I didn't expect me to be top-notch
in making field racing car.

608
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,039
Are you okay, Mobai?

609
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,799
I felt like I just had a fight with this car.

610
00:35:46,799 --> 00:35:48,800
What? Am I good?

611
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:50,480
Miss Liu is amazing.

612
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:51,860
That's quite fast for a first test drive.

613
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,800
Shall we get a fish to celebrate?

614
00:35:53,800 --> 00:35:55,488
I think so, Monkey.

615
00:35:55,488 --> 00:35:57,520
We should get Dill Pickle
around five kilograms.

616
00:35:57,520 --> 00:35:58,560
I'm heading to buy it now.

617
00:35:58,560 --> 00:35:59,620
Do you dare?

618
00:35:59,620 --> 00:36:00,672
Miss Liu.

619
00:36:02,159 --> 00:36:03,320
The car is fast.

620
00:36:03,320 --> 00:36:05,960
But I wanted to tell you how I feel.

621
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,800
What? Just tell me

622
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,900
which data needs to be improved.

623
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:14,559
No, no improvements needed. The car is fast,

624
00:36:14,559 --> 00:36:17,000
especially during accelerating in
straightaways, the ending speed is quite fast.

625
00:36:17,719 --> 00:36:19,079
But for the turns,

626
00:36:19,599 --> 00:36:20,760
it's too aggressive. I…

627
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:22,559
I don't feel like I'm driving the car,
but the car is driving me.

628
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,520
It's not quite what I had in mind.

629
00:36:26,520 --> 00:36:27,719
It's difficult to achieve unity
between driver and car.

630
00:36:29,239 --> 00:36:30,840
Isn't it okay to improve the speed?

631
00:36:31,559 --> 00:36:33,820
You want me to adjust the car to fit you.

632
00:36:33,820 --> 00:36:35,959
Do you also need to adjust yourself to fit me?

633
00:36:35,959 --> 00:36:36,960
Mobai.

634
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,720
Even you would be scared too.

635
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,500
Alright, the biggest task is already completed.

636
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,020
We'll do it differently in the future.

637
00:36:43,020 --> 00:36:44,240
I'm going to the R&D center

638
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:46,360
to fine-tune the equipment's data,
so I won't come over.

639
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:50,399
I'll send someone over with the data files.

640
00:36:50,399 --> 00:36:52,879
You just use my data to adjust the car.

641
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:56,079
I promise it'll only be faster.

642
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:01,119
Did you hear that? Only faster.

643
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:04,480
This is going to level you up.

644
00:37:06,679 --> 00:37:07,712
Are you really okay?

645
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,536
I'm okay. Do you have any water?

646
00:37:09,536 --> 00:37:10,656
Monkey, do you have any water?

647
00:37:10,656 --> 00:37:11,712
Here you are.

648
00:37:11,712 --> 00:37:13,440
- Here, Mr. Mobai.
- Thank you.

649
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,639
You were

650
00:37:17,760 --> 00:37:18,784
awesome!

651
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:20,320
If this continues, I don't know

652
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,376
if my head will still be in place.

653
00:37:23,232 --> 00:37:24,339
You're called Bi Xiaofeng, huh?

654
00:37:24,339 --> 00:37:25,880
Oh my.

655
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:28,519
I can't believe you still remember my name.

656
00:37:30,119 --> 00:37:31,379
Doesn't it say so on your badge?

657
00:37:31,379 --> 00:37:32,480
Bi Xiaofeng.

658
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:35,480
Where's Shen Xi? Why didn't Shen Xi come?

659
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:39,239
She requested to the leaders
not to do field work.

660
00:37:43,239 --> 00:37:47,360
Alright, you can go get busy.

661
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,639
Okay, sorry to disrupt you.

662
00:37:49,639 --> 00:37:50,920
- Thank you for the water.
- Not at all.

663
00:37:54,519 --> 00:37:55,680
Mobai.

664
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,700
If you feel the adjustments aren't appropriate,

665
00:37:59,700 --> 00:38:01,360
let's go talk to Miss Mofei.

666
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:02,368
It's okay.

667
00:38:03,320 --> 00:38:04,639
What Miss Liu said was right.

668
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:05,696
She adjusts the car, and I adjust myself.

669
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:08,039
I'm just not used to it.

670
00:38:09,039 --> 00:38:10,039
I have to conquer the car.

671
00:38:11,039 --> 00:38:12,128
I can do it.

672
00:38:12,128 --> 00:38:13,200
Let me tell you.

673
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,420
Mr. Mobai didn't feel like
driving a car anymore.

674
00:38:15,420 --> 00:38:17,539
It seemed like he's driving an airplane,
so fast

675
00:38:17,539 --> 00:38:18,760
that it's about to fly.

676
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,880
And Miss Liu also said,

677
00:38:21,440 --> 00:38:23,760
it will only be faster.

678
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:28,100
I told you the turns were the most exciting.

679
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:30,300
That car looked like it's going off the track.

680
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,760
I was so scared to hide.

681
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:34,239
Why? You don't know it.

682
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:37,480
This is the legendary drift.

683
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:40,760
I'm telling you, people usually
drift with tail swinging,

684
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:43,719
Mr. Mobai can even drift with headstock.

685
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,960
In the end, Mr. Mobai said to me,

686
00:38:47,199 --> 00:38:48,719
if this continues,

687
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:52,320
he wonders if his head will
be still in place next time.

688
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,559
Was he

689
00:38:54,559 --> 00:38:56,079
just trying to make me laugh?

690
00:38:56,639 --> 00:39:00,520
I think Mr. Mobai was just exaggerating.

691
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,780
I saw a report,

692
00:39:01,780 --> 00:39:03,980
saying that professional racers
are all professional athletes.

693
00:39:03,980 --> 00:39:05,959
who strive for precision.

694
00:39:05,959 --> 00:39:08,719
<i>[New Message, Chen Mobai]</i>
There won't even be a tiny difference when turning.

695
00:39:10,559 --> 00:39:12,840
You still have to steer the car.

696
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,199
I don't know it either.

697
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,119
Where are you going?
It's not time to get off work yet.

698
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:27,079
My mom gets out of the hospital today
and I have to take a leave of absence.

699
00:39:30,559 --> 00:39:31,680
Hello, Mr. Mobai.

700
00:39:32,519 --> 00:39:33,664
Hello, Mr. Mobai.

701
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,128
What's up?

702
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:38,112
Mr. Mobai.

703
00:39:39,239 --> 00:39:40,639
Mr. Mobai.

704
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:42,500
Speak of the devil.

705
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:44,400
We were just talking about you.

706
00:39:46,239 --> 00:39:47,719
Where is Shen Xi?

707
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:49,280
She slipped out again.

708
00:39:49,280 --> 00:39:50,600
No matter what we say, she does not join

709
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,039
or has any interest.

710
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:55,360
Shen Xi took leave today because
her mother gets out of the hospital.

711
00:39:56,119 --> 00:39:57,320
Whatever. Mr. Mobai…

712
00:39:59,076 --> 00:40:02,596
<i>[Inpatient Building]</i>

713
00:40:16,239 --> 00:40:18,660
Driver Mobai at your service, madam.

714
00:40:18,660 --> 00:40:20,599
W-Why are you here?

715
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,880
Isn't it just when you need help?

716
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,360
You!

717
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,240
You never ask me to help,

718
00:40:29,240 --> 00:40:30,639
so I have to show up unannounced.

719
00:40:41,519 --> 00:40:42,624
What's wrong?

720
00:40:45,239 --> 00:40:47,159
How's your car practice today?

721
00:40:47,880 --> 00:40:49,020
Do you know how hot it is today?

722
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:50,619
I ran more than 50 laps.

723
00:40:50,619 --> 00:40:51,900
As soon as I got out of the car,

724
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:54,159
that jumpsuit was wet by sweat all over.

725
00:40:54,159 --> 00:40:56,280
You're a man who always exaggerates.

726
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:58,359
It's true. I'm exhausted.

727
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:00,220
My neck, arms and legs

728
00:41:00,220 --> 00:41:01,680
are so sore.

729
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:02,816
Let me tell you.

730
00:41:03,559 --> 00:41:06,360
That Miss Liu is not
suitable for working on race cars,

731
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:08,320
she should be working on fighter jets.

732
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,340
Maybe later,

733
00:41:09,340 --> 00:41:11,000
I'd be a pilot.

734
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,480
I need to remind you

735
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:14,960
Miss Liu's style is aggressive

736
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:16,719
and you're obsessed with speed.

737
00:41:17,679 --> 00:41:20,239
It's dangerous to put you two together.

738
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:23,392
Do you care about me?

739
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,856
You always talk like this,
what do you expect me to feel?

740
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,020
Give me an answer.

741
00:41:28,020 --> 00:41:29,088
Shen Xi.

742
00:41:29,960 --> 00:41:31,200
- Hello, auntie.
- Mom.

743
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:32,288
Hello.

744
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,080
This is…

745
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:39,800
- Chen.
- Chen, the driver.

746
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:44,239
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

747
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:46,720
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

748
00:41:47,424 --> 00:41:48,519
Let me help you.

749
00:41:48,519 --> 00:41:49,696
No need.

750
00:41:49,696 --> 00:41:50,784
Thank you.

751
00:41:50,784 --> 00:41:51,872
Let me take it. I'll take it.

752
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:53,536
No problem, let me do it.

753
00:41:54,692 --> 00:41:57,120
<i>[Inpatient Building]</i>

754
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:02,760
Thank you.

755
00:42:02,760 --> 00:42:03,776
Mind your head.

756
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:09,500
Auntie, are you comfortable?

757
00:42:09,500 --> 00:42:10,679
I'll move your seat forward a bit.

758
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,928
It's okay.

759
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:15,456
You are quite considerate.

760
00:42:16,679 --> 00:42:18,480
Thank you, auntie. You are also considerate

761
00:42:19,599 --> 00:42:20,599
that noticed my advantages right away.

762
00:42:25,960 --> 00:42:27,119
You've known each other a long time, right?

763
00:42:29,639 --> 00:42:31,599
A friend, he's here to help.

764
00:42:35,360 --> 00:42:36,439
Thank you.

765
00:42:36,439 --> 00:42:37,520
It's okay, auntie.

766
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,359
I love doing favors for my friends.

767
00:42:39,359 --> 00:42:40,879
Helping others makes me healthy.

768
00:42:40,879 --> 00:42:42,048
We are ready to leave.

769
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:44,400
What kind of music do you usually listen to?

770
00:42:45,679 --> 00:42:46,859
Listen to what you want to hear.

771
00:42:46,859 --> 00:42:48,032
Alright.

772
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:57,092
<i>♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫</i>

773
00:42:59,012 --> 00:43:03,616
<i>♫ The heart gradually silences ♫</i>

774
00:43:04,996 --> 00:43:11,584

782
00:43:59,396 --> 00:44:06,272
