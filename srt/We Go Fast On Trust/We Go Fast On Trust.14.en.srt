after breaking the record last time.

is his unstable mentality.

And this training is precisely
to temper his temper

00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:40,879
If I experience any
accidental events in the future,

181
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:44,480
my only hope is to ensure Shen Xi's safety.

182
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,280
Please do not disclose to the public

183
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,000
my sister's identity as an engineer.

184
00:10:49,759 --> 00:10:52,480
Please respect my wish. Thank you.

185
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:22,368
Wear this,

186
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,399
so people can't see your emotions.

187
00:11:30,159 --> 00:11:31,200
It might make you feel better.

188
00:11:46,879 --> 00:11:48,240
Brother, I'm sorry.

189
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,240
I know you wanted to protect me,

190
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:52,000
but it's time to step out

191
00:11:52,679 --> 00:11:54,039
and face the world again.

192
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,180
Excuse me, everyone, the press conference
will pause for a moment.

193
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:08,320
- We will start in half an hour.
- Assistant Jiang.

194
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:13,039
I want to tell everyone.

195
00:12:16,879 --> 00:12:17,984
Sister.

196
00:12:19,039 --> 00:12:20,096
Jiang Wei.

197
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,200
You got this.

198
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:38,592
I believe in you.

199
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:51,960
What does Xi want to say?

200
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,519
I am Shen Xi,

201
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,200
Shen Chuan's sister.

202
00:13:07,799 --> 00:13:10,519
I did work as an engineer at Markus.

203
00:13:11,879 --> 00:13:14,200
Wings of Wind was a joint
development of the team.

204
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:16,720
I was the primary designer.

205
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:20,039
My brother Shen Chuan trusted me deeply.

206
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,799
As his engineer,

207
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:25,440
I should have been more cautious

208
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,000
in eliminating all risks for him.

209
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,039
In the two years after the incident,

210
00:13:34,919 --> 00:13:36,320
I didn't touch racing

211
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,840
because I felt that those
who have done wrong are not eligible,

212
00:13:42,960 --> 00:13:44,000
and I had no extravagant hopes

213
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,960
of doing engineering work again

214
00:13:50,159 --> 00:13:52,279
until I met this group of people at Ruifeng,

215
00:13:53,159 --> 00:13:54,960
who trusted me unconditionally,

216
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,032
making me realize

217
00:13:57,440 --> 00:13:59,819
that I should bear all responsibilities

218
00:13:59,819 --> 00:14:01,000
in the path I chose.

219
00:14:03,039 --> 00:14:04,159
I will accept questions,

220
00:14:06,840 --> 00:14:07,919
but I will not back down.

221
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:13,420
I will follow the path to the end,

222
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:14,480
just like our racing driver,

223
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,240
Chen Mobai.

224
00:14:19,679 --> 00:14:20,704
Because racing…

225
00:14:24,512 --> 00:14:27,000
racing is my only passion.

226
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:35,648
That's all.

227
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,039
Now it's time for your PR skills.

228
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,500
Ruifeng fears no criticism.

229
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:03,880
Results are the best answer.

230
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:05,159
Let's use this for the press release.

231
00:15:24,919 --> 00:15:25,952
Miss Mofei,

232
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,304
my apologies.

233
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,039
I answered those questions just now on stage.

234
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:39,720
I'm the one who should be apologizing.

235
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:46,279
I hit you on the car testing day.

236
00:15:47,799 --> 00:15:48,896
It was wrong of me.

237
00:15:50,159 --> 00:15:51,840
I'm officially apologizing again,

238
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,760
hoping

239
00:15:55,879 --> 00:15:56,960
you'll forgive me.

240
00:16:06,679 --> 00:16:07,680
Before,

241
00:16:08,879 --> 00:16:10,960
I never wanted Chen Mobai to race

242
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,080
because I really couldn't bear

243
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:19,240
the possibility of losing a loved one again.

244
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:23,200
Now, I'm beginning to feel

245
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:28,039
that instead of worrying that his wings
will be melted by the sun,

246
00:16:31,639 --> 00:16:33,320
I might as well believe
that he is the sun himself.

247
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:37,056
Shen Xi,

248
00:16:39,320 --> 00:16:40,639
are you afraid of losing him?

249
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:49,088
I am.

250
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:51,456
Very.

251
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:55,719
Chen Mobai is a very rare

252
00:16:55,719 --> 00:16:57,000
and exceptionally talented driver.

253
00:16:58,639 --> 00:16:59,720
So, all I can do

254
00:17:00,679 --> 00:17:01,879
is to believe in his speed.

255
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,480
This time,

256
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:05,568
next time,

257
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:07,640
and every single time,

258
00:17:07,640 --> 00:17:09,680
I will protect him with a better car.

259
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:15,220
It seems that the matter between women

260
00:17:15,220 --> 00:17:16,288
is not so easy to resolve.

261
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:18,600
You talk as if you understand women,

262
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:19,720
but you've never been in a relationship.

263
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,480
Do you think Shen Xi still

264
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:23,839
has some unresolved feelings?

265
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:26,519
I don't think she's that petty.
She is not angry.

266
00:17:27,104 --> 00:17:28,160
Really?

267
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,759
Okay, enough with the gossip.

268
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:32,119
I didn't hear a word.

269
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:34,799
Do you guys realize how noisy you are?

270
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:36,960
Come over.

271
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:47,079
Is it fun to watch the drama?

272
00:17:47,839 --> 00:17:48,896
Let's go.

273
00:17:51,519 --> 00:17:52,880
Let's have something good tonight, I'm buying.

274
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,400
Come on.

275
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,240
Let's go.

276
00:18:04,119 --> 00:18:05,160
You were really impressive today.

277
00:18:07,839 --> 00:18:11,279
I just didn't want to let your trust down.

278
00:18:18,640 --> 00:18:20,440
Stupid fool!

279
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,936
Only you would fall for the same trap twice,

280
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,960
even a pig wouldn't.

281
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:27,780
You ended up promoting them. Do you know that?

282
00:18:27,780 --> 00:18:29,119
The presale for Maituo is going crazy,

283
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:31,580
and if they score a good result in Formula A,

284
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,152
Junda will be the biggest joke

285
00:18:33,152 --> 00:18:34,468
in the world.

286
00:18:37,079 --> 00:18:39,120
Sorry, Chairman, I have to go now.

287
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,256
There's a call coming in.

288
00:18:40,256 --> 00:18:41,400
Even if it's a call from heaven,

289
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,720
you have to let me finish first.

290
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,759
Yes, Chairman.

291
00:18:45,920 --> 00:18:47,640
It's a call from Lin Shaoqian.

292
00:18:50,519 --> 00:18:51,640
Pick it up quickly.

293
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,440
Inform me immediately if there's any news.

294
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,528
Of course.

295
00:18:59,359 --> 00:19:00,416
Hello.

296
00:19:01,119 --> 00:19:02,208
I thought about it

297
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,400
and I decided to formally join you.

298
00:19:05,559 --> 00:19:07,400
Really? Are you sure?

299
00:19:08,319 --> 00:19:09,472
I am.

300
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:17,559
You Chinese have a wonderful saying

301
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:19,200
Misfortune

302
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:20,920
might be a blessing in disguise.

303
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:25,888
Chen Mobai.

304
00:19:26,920 --> 00:19:27,936
I want to see

305
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,240
whether you are worthy of Shen Xi's choice.

306
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,199
You're here so early.

307
00:19:53,199 --> 00:19:54,519
Aren't you earlier than me?

308
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,119
Look at the time now.

309
00:19:59,232 --> 00:20:00,352
What are you doing here?

310
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:04,320
After what happened yesterday,
Miss Mofei didn't say anything

311
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:06,400
but she's concerned about the team.

312
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:08,279
She called all the tech people over

313
00:20:08,279 --> 00:20:09,359
at four o'clock this morning.

314
00:20:10,319 --> 00:20:11,559
She wanted to check all the equipment

315
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:13,000
before you came for training

316
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,240
and see if there was anything
that could be updated.

317
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:16,240
She also wanted to give you a surprise.

318
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,864
Thank you.

319
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,448
Why are you here?

320
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:38,112
What's wrong with me?

321
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,039
Am I not qualified to be your driver?

322
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,279
You came early, didn't you?

323
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,480
I told Jiang Wei to go home.

324
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:49,824
Today,

325
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,000
I will be your driver.

326
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,336
What are we doing here?

327
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,079
Did you forget?

328
00:21:05,079 --> 00:21:06,720
You used to love coming here in middle school.

329
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,340
Whenever you didn't do well on an exam
and Dad scolded you,

330
00:21:09,340 --> 00:21:10,480
you would sneak over here for the slide.

331
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,359
You even told me when I was little

332
00:21:14,079 --> 00:21:16,039
that life is like a slide.

333
00:21:16,759 --> 00:21:19,039
Sliding down is easy, but climbing up is hard.

334
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:20,992
You had a lot of wise words.

335
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,480
No, wait.

336
00:21:25,079 --> 00:21:26,319
We're here now, slide once.

337
00:21:26,848 --> 00:21:27,920
No, I won't. It's childish.

338
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,380
Well, wait for me here.

339
00:21:29,380 --> 00:21:30,464
You can watch me slide.

340
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:51,000
Sister, I'm stuck. Can you help me?

341
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,160
Chen Mobai, seriously?

342
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:16,448
Thank you.

343
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,328
Childhood was good.

344
00:22:20,119 --> 00:22:21,120
We had no worries.

345
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,640
Growing up can be good too.

346
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,079
Who said growing up
must involve worries, right?

347
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:32,519
I don't have as simple a mind as you.

348
00:22:40,359 --> 00:22:41,440
Thank you

349
00:22:42,759 --> 00:22:43,840
for trusting me

350
00:22:44,839 --> 00:22:45,920
and Shen Xi.

351
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,400
It was too late for me to jump off board.

352
00:22:54,039 --> 00:22:55,136
Is this how you thank me?

353
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,960
I'll get you a championship, okay?

354
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:00,128
Just do your best.

355
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,840
I can become a champion with just 30% effort.

356
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:06,839
If I tried my best, the opposition
would be knocked down.

357
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,240
How was your car practice today?

358
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:25,079
How should I put it?

359
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:28,299
Watching Mobai practice driving
was all about speed and aesthetics,

360
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,559
and now it feels totally different.

361
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:34,119
It's like he's dominating the racetrack.

362
00:23:35,279 --> 00:23:36,779
Especially when passing the fourth turn,

363
00:23:36,779 --> 00:23:39,000
did you see that? Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh,

364
00:23:39,599 --> 00:23:41,359
like a hot knife through butter.

365
00:23:43,799 --> 00:23:44,832
Let me see.

366
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,440
So cool.

367
00:23:48,039 --> 00:23:49,056
Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.

368
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,240
Didn't I say

369
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,319
that after changing the new air sleeve,
we need to collect aerodynamic data,

370
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:58,880
and not be aggressive at the fourth turn,

371
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,560
otherwise, the tires wear out too fast

372
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,720
and affect the overall balance?

373
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:05,720
It's a misunderstanding.

374
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:08,720
It wasn't a hot knife through butter,

375
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:12,000
at most, it was cutting frozen tofu
with a nail clipper.

376
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:13,720
Yes, yes, frozen tofu.

377
00:24:14,640 --> 00:24:15,648
Where is Chen Mobai?

378
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:17,880
He went to buy food.

379
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:20,840
He said he had a moment of narcissism,

380
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,680
and he wanted to give everyone a treat.

381
00:24:33,536 --> 00:24:34,580
Chen Mobai.

382
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:35,599
Do you want any drinks?

383
00:24:36,359 --> 00:24:37,799
Did you mess around while driving today?

384
00:24:39,319 --> 00:24:40,352
I didn't.

385
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,280
I was learning from a certain little master,

386
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,799
and I was eager to practice.

387
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:52,559
Practicing your driving skills or eloquence?

388
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:56,079
Do you know it takes
three hours to correct this data?

389
00:24:57,119 --> 00:24:58,359
Thanks a lot.

390
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,392
Are you teasing me?

391
00:25:00,079 --> 00:25:01,960
Is this your first time teasing me?

392
00:25:03,079 --> 00:25:05,020
Then, today is worth celebrating.

393
00:25:05,020 --> 00:25:06,279
What do you want to eat?
I'll bring it back for you.

394
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:07,840
No need.

395
00:25:09,759 --> 00:25:11,519
I'm not eating. You guys go ahead.

396
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:12,680
I'm going to correct the data.

397
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,288
Shen Xi, are you okay?

398
00:25:16,288 --> 00:25:17,376
I'm fine.

399
00:25:17,376 --> 00:25:18,560
What happened to your knee?

400
00:25:18,560 --> 00:25:21,119
The street light outside my house was broken,
and I didn't see the road.

401
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:22,780
[Chen Mobai]
I accidentally fell and scraped it.

402
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:24,840
Is it serious? Do you need
to go to the hospital?

403
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:25,984
It's just a scrape, I'm fine.

404
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,300
- Really, little master?
- I'm fine.

405
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:32,360
Shen Xi, take it slow. Take a rest early.

406
00:25:32,360 --> 00:25:33,408
Okay.

407
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,488
Hello?

408
00:26:31,488 --> 00:26:32,960
Keep walking.

409
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:35,039
I have a surprise prepared for you.

410
00:26:37,799 --> 00:26:38,880
What surprise?

411
00:26:39,920 --> 00:26:41,000
Keep walking and you'll know.

412
00:26:45,668 --> 00:26:50,756
♫ The rose leaves a fragrance ♫

413
00:26:50,756 --> 00:26:56,544
♫ The setting sun radiates light ♫

414
00:26:56,544 --> 00:27:00,768
♫ Your departure ♫

415
00:27:03,588 --> 00:27:07,232
♫ Only left a transparent wound ♫

416
00:27:11,716 --> 00:27:14,560
♫ I keep falling ♫

417
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:18,336
♫ Towards the direction you left ♫

418
00:27:18,336 --> 00:27:23,648
♫ I'm embracing the fragments of memory ♫

419
00:27:23,648 --> 00:27:27,200
♫ I keep falling ♫

420
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:33,440
♫ Holding our puzzle ♫

421
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:35,200
Is this the surprise you meant?

422
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,424
♫ Being scratched by the fragments of memory ♫

423
00:27:39,424 --> 00:27:42,400
♫ Being scratched by the fragments of memory ♫

424
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,424
Turn around.

425
00:27:45,984 --> 00:27:49,696
♫ Come back, my love ♫

426
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:54,519
This is the surprise I meant.

427
00:27:56,319 --> 00:27:57,920
The reason why I didn't accompany you
to work overtime

428
00:27:58,960 --> 00:28:00,200
is to prepare this for you.

429
00:28:01,536 --> 00:28:02,539
It's so dangerous for a girl

430
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:04,119
to go home without a light.

431
00:28:05,559 --> 00:28:06,560
Now it's okay.

432
00:28:07,319 --> 00:28:08,440
No matter how late you go home in the future,

433
00:28:10,039 --> 00:28:11,079
with every step you take,

434
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:13,536
a light will illuminate.

435
00:28:13,536 --> 00:28:16,256
♫ Sinking into the deep sea of memory ♫

436
00:28:17,408 --> 00:28:20,288
♫ You know I'm still holding ♫

437
00:28:20,288 --> 00:28:22,976
♫ Our pieces ♫

438
00:28:22,976 --> 00:28:29,152
♫ Sinking into the deep sea of memory ♫

439
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,032
Touched, aren't you?

440
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:35,599
To the point of being speechless?

441
00:28:36,896 --> 00:28:39,776
♫ Come back, my love ♫

442
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,839
Did you connect the wires properly?

443
00:28:42,880 --> 00:28:45,240
There is no fuse in the circuit here.

444
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:49,060
If there is a short circuit,
it could easily cause a fire.

445
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:50,559
Shen Xi.

446
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:52,799
I prepared a gift for you with a lot of work,

447
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,464
a surprise,

448
00:28:55,079 --> 00:28:56,200
and this is your response.

449
00:29:00,759 --> 00:29:01,760
I am joking with you.

450
00:29:03,599 --> 00:29:04,759
I didn't know you could joke.

451
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:07,072
I learned it from you.

452
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:11,840
Chen Mobai.

453
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:16,032
Thank you.

454
00:29:20,799 --> 00:29:21,888
For what?

455
00:29:26,279 --> 00:29:27,680
Thank you

456
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,599
for doing so much for me.

457
00:29:33,799 --> 00:29:34,848
Shen Xi.

458
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,000
You…

459
00:29:47,319 --> 00:29:48,400
You…

460
00:29:53,079 --> 00:29:54,176
Take the call first.

461
00:30:00,772 --> 00:30:03,296
[Lin Shaoqian]

462
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:06,480
Shaoqian, what's up?

463
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,039
Xi, are you at home?

464
00:30:11,119 --> 00:30:12,119
I just got home.

465
00:30:13,559 --> 00:30:14,624
I have something to tell you.

466
00:30:15,359 --> 00:30:17,000
I'll be there soon. Wait for me.

467
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:20,064
Okay.

468
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:32,608
Young man.

469
00:30:34,079 --> 00:30:36,400
What are those flowers in your hands?

470
00:30:39,968 --> 00:30:41,060
Cornflowers.

471
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:43,540
Don't people always give roses?

472
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,759
Why are you giving her these?

473
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,359
The place my friend and I used to live

474
00:30:49,000 --> 00:30:50,240
was covered with these flowers.

475
00:30:53,759 --> 00:30:55,920
I don't know if she will be

476
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:57,920
happy to see these.

477
00:30:59,079 --> 00:31:00,160
She definitely will be.

478
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:08,559
Did Lin Shaoqian need anything?

479
00:31:10,759 --> 00:31:13,640
He said he had something important to tell me.

480
00:31:19,519 --> 00:31:20,576
Okay.

481
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:23,960
Then I, I should leave first.

482
00:31:27,559 --> 00:31:28,608
Chen Mobai.

483
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,440
What were you

484
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:37,312
about to say just now?

485
00:31:45,400 --> 00:31:47,920
You said you would stay with me

486
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:52,079
until the Super Grand Prix.

487
00:32:00,359 --> 00:32:01,408
I am very happy.

488
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,960
And it's not

489
00:32:12,079 --> 00:32:14,279
just because you're my engineer.

490
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,352
That's it.

491
00:32:27,079 --> 00:32:28,279
Alright,

492
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,319
I'll leave now.

493
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:09,792
Here you go.

494
00:33:12,839 --> 00:33:13,888
Young man,

495
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:17,920
in life, sometimes when you miss something,

496
00:33:18,519 --> 00:33:21,359
it might never come back to you.

497
00:33:22,119 --> 00:33:25,720
So, if you like someone, hold on tight.

498
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,599
Don't ever let it become a regret for life.

499
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:38,839
Okay, thank you.

500
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:58,048
This is the price adjustment notice

501
00:33:58,048 --> 00:33:59,328
that all Junda distributors received.

502
00:33:59,328 --> 00:34:00,640
Please take a close look.

503
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,039
We just won a battle.

504
00:34:04,839 --> 00:34:06,339
However, the opponents
have become even more frenzied.

505
00:34:06,339 --> 00:34:08,079
This time they've gone all in.

506
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:10,619
Maituo has just released its price,

507
00:34:10,619 --> 00:34:12,379
and the average selling price
of all Junda models

508
00:34:12,379 --> 00:34:15,079
dropped nearly ten points.

509
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,179
Their intention is just to keep a tight grip

510
00:34:17,179 --> 00:34:18,379
on our order volume.

511
00:34:18,379 --> 00:34:20,500
The marketing department
is under a lot of pressure.

512
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,100
Should we also offer some discounts

513
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:24,199
and fight with them?

514
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,920
Price wars will only hurt both parties.

515
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:31,000
Moreover, offering a discount
in Maituo's presale

516
00:34:31,920 --> 00:34:33,660
will only damage the brand image.

517
00:34:33,660 --> 00:34:36,560
It's obvious that they
are targeting our Ruifeng models.

518
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:38,640
Are we just going to watch

519
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:39,744
and do nothing?

520
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:42,800
Does the publicity department
have any good suggestions?

521
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:47,760
They have indeed made a few powerful proposals

522
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,520
but they all have to do
with our Race Team's performance.

523
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,760
A commemorative print
of the first victory in Formula A.

524
00:34:55,519 --> 00:34:56,719
Track experience activities.

525
00:34:58,039 --> 00:34:59,359
This is a good angle.

526
00:34:59,359 --> 00:35:01,740
If Mr. Mobai consistently performs well

527
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,540
in the Formula A competition,

528
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:05,760
we will have the best publicity opportunity.

529
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:08,480
Here, look at this slogan.

530
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:11,460
A price war is not a real fight.

531
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:13,520
The final verdict should be on the track.

532
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:14,919
We have to tell the market

533
00:35:14,919 --> 00:35:16,660
that Junda's lowering its price

534
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:18,800
can only prove that their cars
are not up to standard.

535
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:23,500
How is Mobai doing in his car training?

536
00:35:23,500 --> 00:35:26,040
Is there anything the company can help with?

537
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:27,760
Everything is smooth, and no issues for now.

538
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:30,368
Then tell him,

539
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:33,199
we want to see his training results.

540
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:34,840
Remind him also,

541
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,660
Junda and Takano have an unusual relationship.

542
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:38,159
This time on the racetrack,

543
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:40,860
- do not let his guard down.
- Okay.

544
00:35:40,860 --> 00:35:43,360
Yeah, it takes years to prepare for war,
but only a moment to wage it.

545
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,260
Yongjian, you need to coordinate
with the publicity department right away.

546
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:47,940
We must build up the momentum before the race.

547
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,000
No problem.

548
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,480
Everyone, this time we must thwart Junda

549
00:35:52,039 --> 00:35:54,079
and bury them in the grave they dug.

550
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,859
So fishy.

551
00:35:58,859 --> 00:36:00,239
Who is this guy?

552
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,576
Mr. Lin.

553
00:36:16,576 --> 00:36:18,039
I'm honored to see you here.

554
00:36:18,559 --> 00:36:20,360
I look forward to your instruction.

555
00:36:21,559 --> 00:36:23,000
Thank you. We'll do it together.

556
00:36:23,519 --> 00:36:26,399
James? James Lin?

557
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:29,039
So you are the expert
that Mr. Toyama talks about.

558
00:36:30,039 --> 00:36:31,320
So that's how you broke a record

559
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:33,179
by just one month in Germany.

560
00:36:33,179 --> 00:36:34,760
Now I get it, Mitsui san.

561
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,119
Gotta learn

562
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,159
from the Master.

563
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,239
It's not enough.

564
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:43,840
That's right. That's not enough.

565
00:36:44,672 --> 00:36:45,760
I'm here to make you the most

566
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,159
dangerous competition on the track.

567
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,000
Show Ruifeng what F A is really all about.

568
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:54,320
So, why don't we sit down and talk?

569
00:36:55,960 --> 00:36:57,056
Please.

570
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:03,840
Chen Mobai, you about to go down.

571
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,288
Come on, come here.

572
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,320
I brought treats for you guys.

573
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:20,128
Check out what I've got here.

574
00:37:20,679 --> 00:37:21,696
Are you taking data?

575
00:37:23,239 --> 00:37:25,440
Here, try this cake.

576
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:26,780
This cake is particularly good.

577
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:30,599
Hao Yang spent three years' worth
of delivery points on it.

578
00:37:31,519 --> 00:37:33,199
You shouldn't work today.

579
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,440
Enjoy the race like an audience.

580
00:37:36,920 --> 00:37:38,599
It's okay. I will finish
sorting everything out first.

581
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,320
Have a bite first.

582
00:37:41,519 --> 00:37:42,720
I'll eat when I'm done.

583
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:45,800
- Just take a bite.
- After sorting things out first.

584
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,080
If you don't take the bite,

585
00:37:47,080 --> 00:37:48,639
Chen Mobai is going to feed you.

586
00:37:51,872 --> 00:37:52,980
Okay, I…

587
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,000
You, you keep sorting.

588
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:56,640
I'll f-feed you.

589
00:38:00,280 --> 00:38:01,360
I can do it by myself.

590
00:38:05,119 --> 00:38:06,379
Are they a couple yet?

591
00:38:06,379 --> 00:38:08,559
I can't tell. But,

592
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,940
isn't the atmosphere sweet?

593
00:38:11,940 --> 00:38:13,440
Yep, things are looking good.

594
00:38:14,079 --> 00:38:15,104
Looking good.

595
00:38:18,599 --> 00:38:20,559
Can I try some?

596
00:38:27,744 --> 00:38:28,800
Sweet.

597
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:31,700
If they are sharing a cake now,

598
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:32,719
does it count as an indirect kiss?

599
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:35,080
Come, come over here.

600
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,520
Yang, it hurts!

601
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:39,000
Why do you look like a third wheel?

602
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,032
You were so unnecessary.

603
00:38:41,320 --> 00:38:42,368
That's not what I meant.

604
00:38:45,280 --> 00:38:46,400
Go ahead. I won't eat it anymore.

605
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:50,660
No worries. I'll eat later.

606
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:51,712
I'll eat later.

607
00:38:57,632 --> 00:38:58,848
Just one bite.

608
00:38:58,848 --> 00:38:59,860
So stingy.

609
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:00,960
Can you seriously watch the game?

610
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:05,200
Miss Mofei is coming over tomorrow
to watch our car testing.

611
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:07,239
We must deliver
this kind of performance tomorrow.

612
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,620
Oh dear, it crashed.

613
00:39:18,620 --> 00:39:19,900
The car is all broken.

614
00:39:19,900 --> 00:39:22,200
No way. The whole car is wrecked.

615
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:23,560
How could someone say…

616
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,120
he and Mobai have similar styles?

617
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:26,208
Anyway…

618
00:39:27,719 --> 00:39:28,800
The car testing is tomorrow.

619
00:39:29,679 --> 00:39:32,639
Those who still have things to do, hurry up!
Get things organized.

620
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:34,816
Go!

621
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,488
Are you alright?

622
00:39:45,519 --> 00:39:47,480
I have more documents to sort out.

623
00:39:48,280 --> 00:39:49,344
I will go back first.

624
00:39:50,116 --> 00:39:53,700
[Massive Satisfaction]

625
00:40:47,679 --> 00:40:48,760
[Chen Mobai]
Don't think about what happened today.

626
00:40:50,039 --> 00:40:52,199
Go to bed early. No staying up late.

627
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,119
I'm adjusting the data.

628
00:40:59,119 --> 00:41:01,159
For the car test tomorrow, safety first…

629
00:41:04,639 --> 00:41:06,480
[Shen Xi]
Don't worry. I won't stay up.

630
00:41:49,088 --> 00:41:50,208
Miss Zhao.

631
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:53,480
Miss Zhao, are you here to watch
the car testing today?

632
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,000
I finally got to see
Engineer Shen's first answer sheet.

633
00:41:57,559 --> 00:41:58,656
How could I not miss it?

634
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,840
Rest assured, Miss Zhao.

635
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:04,500
Dr. Shen and Mobai make a perfect fit.

636
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,719
Their tacit understanding is excellent.

637
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,599
No, no.

638
00:42:09,239 --> 00:42:13,920
I mean the cooperation between them.
The work cooperation.

639
00:42:16,480 --> 00:42:17,504
Anyway, drink some water.

640
00:42:31,480 --> 00:42:32,920
Oh dear, it crashed.

641
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:34,519
The car is all broken.

642
00:42:35,679 --> 00:42:36,820
How could someone say

643
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:38,480
he and Mobai have similar styles?

644
00:42:49,316 --> 00:42:53,796
♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫

645
00:42:55,716 --> 00:43:00,320
♫ The heart gradually silences ♫

646
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:08,288
♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫

647
00:43:08,288 --> 00:43:13,376
♫ I can't delete them ♫

648
00:43:14,436 --> 00:43:20,448
♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫

649
00:43:20,448 --> 00:43:27,328
♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫

650
00:43:27,328 --> 00:43:35,776
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

651
00:43:36,612 --> 00:43:40,608
♫ Fading away ♫

652
00:43:41,764 --> 00:43:48,256
♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫

653
00:43:48,256 --> 00:43:54,624
♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫

654
00:43:56,100 --> 00:44:02,976
♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫

655
00:44:02,976 --> 00:44:07,328
♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫

656
00:44:07,328 --> 00:44:13,696
♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫

657
00:44:13,696 --> 00:44:20,448
♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫

658
00:44:20,448 --> 00:44:27,776
♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫

659
00:44:27,776 --> 00:44:37,376
♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫
