Monkey. Get the final adjustments done in time.

16
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,460
Chubby, Xu Gong, how is it going?

17
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,700
- No problem.
- Chen Mobai, let go.

18
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:47,159
- Chen Mobai.
- Since you are already here,

19
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:49,400
enjoy the results of our effort

20
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:50,640
and witness my victory.

21
00:01:51,359 --> 00:01:52,640
Such a good atmosphere, isn't it?

22
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,780
I'm glad you finally made it.

23
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,640
I was afraid Lu Yunhao might get lucky today.

24
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,879
How could that be?

25
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,019
Mobai, your car is almost ready.

26
00:01:58,019 --> 00:01:59,159
I'll do a final check on the engine.

27
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:03,424
Don't even think about leaving.

28
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:05,344
Watch me race.

29
00:02:06,208 --> 00:02:07,264
Guys,

30
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:10,720
let's start.

31
00:02:54,176 --> 00:02:55,264
Shen Xi,

32
00:02:57,039 --> 00:02:58,176
why are you standing there?

33
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,384
Come in and sit down.

34
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,800
He only got 8th place in the qualifying race.

35
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,920
In the real race,
he'll just be an also-ran at best.

36
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,099
How can he win the championship?

37
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,759
This race affects our interests.

38
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:14,439
Why can't you provide him
with some good hardware?

39
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,319
He doesn't want it.

40
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,408
What will we do if we lose?

41
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,000
Do you have any other solutions?

42
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,680
I didn't expect him to be so far back
in the qualifying race.

43
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,260
However, a comeback from adversity

44
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,879
is much more thrilling than a total victory.

45
00:03:32,199 --> 00:03:34,980
But those failed challengers
can only be forgotten

46
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:36,159
and become the industry's clowns.

47
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:38,780
Miss Zhao, have some tea.

48
00:03:38,780 --> 00:03:39,872
Thank you.

49
00:03:40,416 --> 00:03:41,420
Mr. Jiang, please.

50
00:03:41,420 --> 00:03:42,680
With your support this time,

51
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,879
we, Junda, are definitely holding on
to winning tickets.

52
00:03:48,032 --> 00:03:49,152
Mr. An.

53
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:50,319
Miss Mofei.

54
00:03:50,976 --> 00:03:52,064
And Miss Zhao.

55
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,520
Long time no see.

56
00:03:56,039 --> 00:03:57,080
It seems the rumors are true.

57
00:03:57,824 --> 00:03:58,912
Ruifeng

58
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:01,000
is about to return to the track.

59
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,280
Mr. Jiang, you are really well informed.

60
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,112
The return of Ruifeng

61
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:07,840
is big news in the industry.

62
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,400
We, Junda, are the first to cheer you on.

63
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:13,696
However, Miss Mofei,

64
00:04:14,439 --> 00:04:16,759
your little brother
seems to be off to a bad start.

65
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:18,959
Can he make it in time?

66
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:20,672
In a tortoise-and-hare race,

67
00:04:21,184 --> 00:04:22,220
no one knows

68
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:24,360
what the outcome will be until the last moment.

69
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:26,208
Alright.

70
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:28,128
Let me introduce

71
00:04:28,879 --> 00:04:31,399
the number one driver
from the Takano team in Japan,

72
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,879
the record holder
of three raceways in Formula A,

73
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,544
Mitsui Taku.

74
00:04:37,839 --> 00:04:38,839
It's a pleasure to meet you.

75
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:42,160
I didn't expect
that you'd invite the king of racing in Asia.

76
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:44,800
It seems Junda is determined to win.

77
00:04:46,048 --> 00:04:47,168
Mr. Mitsui,

78
00:04:47,839 --> 00:04:49,360
according to your experience,

79
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:51,600
with Chen Mobai entering the track like this,

80
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:52,920
how much worse could his results be

81
00:04:53,439 --> 00:04:54,959
compared to Yunhao?

82
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,519
Some say

83
00:04:57,519 --> 00:04:58,624
that the charm of racing

84
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,360
lies in its unpredictable drama.

85
00:05:02,319 --> 00:05:04,639
But the drivers of Takano

86
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:06,279
do not believe in miracles.

87
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:08,680
They only believe in strength.

88
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,600
I think he might be lapped,

89
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,319
even several times.

90
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:20,319
Alright, Miss Mofei,

91
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,720
let us wait and see then.

92
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:38,299
Adjust the rear wing to 30 degrees.

93
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:39,959
The downforce is already high.

94
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:42,600
We will suffer on the straight road
if we make it any higher.

95
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,000
I excel at the bends.

96
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,639
I can make up for the loss
on the straight road.

97
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:51,008
Test the ignition.

98
00:06:00,439 --> 00:06:02,940
Good. It sounds like a champion.

99
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:04,439
Hit the road in a moment and let them see.

100
00:06:05,536 --> 00:06:06,624
Wait a minute.

101
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,144
What's up?

102
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:14,240
Are you sure you've fully checked the car

103
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:16,032
and there's no problem?

104
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:18,959
Of course. We have debugged it.
There's no problem.

105
00:06:21,824 --> 00:06:22,839
What's the problem?

106
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,179
You have five minutes.
Hurry up and do the final check.

107
00:06:25,179 --> 00:06:26,399
Mobai, we are running out of time.

108
00:06:27,744 --> 00:06:28,864
Go ahead.

109
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:34,319
Check and see if there is any loose gasket.

110
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,800
Gasket?!

111
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,799
Do you know how many gaskets are on this car?

112
00:06:38,799 --> 00:06:40,759
Don't flaunt the word you just learned.

113
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:44,416
Quickly check it over again.

114
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,199
I believe in her intuition.

115
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,480
You are three minutes down. Everyone, hurry up!

116
00:06:58,199 --> 00:06:59,500
Everything is normal with no problems.

117
00:06:59,500 --> 00:07:00,639
- Check.
- Check.

118
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,199
Alright, Mobai, hurry up.

119
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:13,056
This is your first time at the race track.

120
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:14,784
Nervousness is perfectly normal.

121
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,600
Don't worry. I'll come back safe.

122
00:07:20,832 --> 00:07:21,940
Skyfall!

123
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,072
Skyfall!

124
00:07:24,556 --> 00:07:28,192
<i>[The racing car is too fast,
and I want to slow down.]</i>

125
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,260
Dear audience and all the race fans,

126
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,359
we are here
at the Linhai International Circuit.

127
00:07:41,359 --> 00:07:43,600
What's about to start is the closing race
of this year's

128
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,680
- China Formula B Championship.
<i>- I hope I heard wrong.</i>

129
00:07:46,399 --> 00:07:47,820
The weather today is very hot.

130
00:07:47,820 --> 00:07:48,960
And we can feel

131
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,079
that the air in the field is even hotter.

132
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:54,320
14 top drivers from all over the country

133
00:07:54,320 --> 00:07:56,099
are already positioned in the starting area.

134
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:58,540
After one season, seven divisions,

135
00:07:58,540 --> 00:08:00,900
and dozens of high-speed races,

136
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:03,040
they've finally come to this decisive moment.

137
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,079
On the pole position
is Lu Yunhao from the Junda.

138
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:09,959
His performance throughout the season
was flawless.

139
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:13,100
And the biggest threat to him, Chen Mobai,

140
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:16,460
didn't do well due to a car malfunction
in the qualifying race yesterday

141
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:18,160
and only made it to the 8th position.

142
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,100
Starting so far back,

143
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,220
Chen Mobai, who wants to win the championship,

144
00:08:22,220 --> 00:08:23,968
is clearly at a disadvantage
right from the start.

145
00:08:23,968 --> 00:08:24,992
However,

146
00:08:24,992 --> 00:08:27,759
this makes today's race more intriguing.

147
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,500
<i>Before the race begins, let us</i>

148
00:08:30,500 --> 00:08:32,700
<i>have a quick look at the current rankings.</i>

149
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,080
<i>In the ranking list for drivers,</i>

150
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,300
Lu Yunhao and Chen Mobai are equal in points,
ranked neck and neck,

151
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,120
and far ahead of other competitors.

152
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:42,040
Whoever wins today's race

153
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:44,219
will be crowned this year's overall champion

154
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:45,860
and steadily gain qualification

155
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,720
for the Formula A Championship
in the next season.

156
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:49,320
And don't forget

157
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,020
that they both have the potential to compete

158
00:08:51,020 --> 00:08:52,940
for the Super Grand Prix as excellent drivers.

159
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,860
And every annual overall championship

160
00:08:54,860 --> 00:08:57,600
serves as an important chip
for its owner to enter the Super Grand Prize.

161
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:01,120
<i>So, today's fight for the championship
is of self-explanatory importance.</i>

162
00:09:01,799 --> 00:09:03,920
<i>Alright, let's wait together</i>

163
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:05,039
<i>for the suspense to be revealed.</i>

164
00:09:07,232 --> 00:09:08,340
The race begins!

165
00:09:08,340 --> 00:09:10,500
Lu Yunhao has started off very fast,

166
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,940
maintaining his pole position advantage.

167
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:13,180
The other drivers

168
00:09:13,180 --> 00:09:15,180
<i>also adopted very aggressive strategies
right from the start,</i>

169
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:17,320
<i>all looking for opportunities
to gain positions fiercely.</i>

170
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,719
<i>This is indeed the final race.</i>

171
00:09:18,719 --> 00:09:20,760
It's already full of tension at the beginning.

172
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:24,279
Today's race is sure
to present fierce competition.

173
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:27,260
He's dropped to 9th.

174
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:28,320
Hurry up a bit.

175
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:29,919
Mobai, stay stable at all costs.

176
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,820
<i>The race has only just begun,</i>

177
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,880
<i>and the situation on the field
is still quite clear.</i>

178
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,320
Lu Yunhao, who started in pole position,

179
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:37,740
keeps first place.

180
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,288
Luo Jiacheng, who is always known
for his powerful explosiveness,

181
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:41,344
follows closely behind him.

182
00:09:41,344 --> 00:09:43,240
The competition is extremely fierce.

183
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,260
Although Chen Mobai keeps pushing

184
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,940
and has overtaken two cars ahead

185
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:48,100
and moved up to 7th place,

186
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,719
he's still too far behind.

187
00:09:49,719 --> 00:09:52,200
If this situation continues,

188
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,900
it will be hard for him to get a chance
to stage the remarkable comeback

189
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,279
as in previous races.

190
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,500
Mobai, bend four ahead of you is sharp.

191
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,799
Mind your speed.

192
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,420
Sharp turns are a good chance to overtake.

193
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:03,960
They have now approached the first sharp turn,
which is bend four.

194
00:10:03,960 --> 00:10:06,500
But today, not a single driver has slowed down.

195
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:08,240
This is supposed to be a slow turn.

196
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:11,039
The competitive atmosphere of the final
race really makes people hold their breath!

197
00:10:11,879 --> 00:10:13,440
The No. 49 car from the Ocean team

198
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,779
had a serious accident

199
00:10:14,779 --> 00:10:16,000
and flew off the track.

200
00:10:17,919 --> 00:10:19,760
The others pressed too close
to be able to dodge.

201
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:21,080
Multiple cars collided.

202
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:28,200
<i>No. Chen Mobai can't brake in time!</i>

203
00:10:33,856 --> 00:10:34,900
Chen Mobai!

204
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,160
With an astonishing reaction speed,

205
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,840
Chen Mobai passed through this dangerous area!

206
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,859
Now the judge shows a yellow flag,

207
00:10:41,859 --> 00:10:43,039
<i>and the safety car also moves.</i>

208
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:47,919
This guy is something.

209
00:10:48,679 --> 00:10:50,280
People say he is fearless and daredevil,

210
00:10:50,280 --> 00:10:51,960
earning the title of King of Racing.

211
00:10:52,919 --> 00:10:54,720
But I think, besides his persistence,

212
00:10:55,440 --> 00:10:57,460
his judgment and mental quality on the track

213
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:58,759
are indeed superior.

214
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,432
Mobai is great!

215
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,720
I told you! It's a jinx.

216
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,608
The driver has come out of the car. He's safe.

217
00:11:09,639 --> 00:11:10,639
Don't be distracted, you guys.

218
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,792
We must secure the points
for the championship today.

219
00:11:13,792 --> 00:11:14,879
Roger that.

220
00:11:14,879 --> 00:11:16,420
Okay, the safety car's top light is off.

221
00:11:16,420 --> 00:11:17,559
The race restarts.

222
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,779
In an attempt to turn the tide,
Chen Mobai has seized the moment

223
00:11:20,779 --> 00:11:22,480
and managed to climb to the third position.

224
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:23,519
It's really not easy.

225
00:11:24,039 --> 00:11:25,740
So, can Lu Yunhao,
who has been leading all the way,

226
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:27,580
hold his position as number one?

227
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:28,736
We'll have to wait and see.

228
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,500
The outside track! Take the outside track!

229
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:33,060
Chen Mobai has overtaken Luo Jiacheng

230
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,279
and cut into second place.

231
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:36,580
That's really incredible.

232
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,360
He is still reducing the distance
with Lu Yunhao.

233
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,899
Now they arrive at the 14th bend.

234
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:48,719
It is the most dangerous turn
on the whole track.

235
00:11:48,719 --> 00:11:51,300
Lu Yunhao and Chen Mobai are worthy opponents.

236
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,460
They have both completed a beautiful turn.

237
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:55,759
The positions remain unchanged.

238
00:11:56,720 --> 00:11:57,879
Can I be a little more aggressive?

239
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:00,736
Yes.

240
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:05,400
Chen Mobai is continuously closing in
on the front car, Lu Yunhao.

241
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:08,180
It's clear he's looking
for the best time to attack,

242
00:12:08,180 --> 00:12:09,579
preparing to overtake at any moment.

243
00:12:09,579 --> 00:12:10,624
It's too close.

244
00:12:11,552 --> 00:12:12,620
That's the point.

245
00:12:12,620 --> 00:12:13,759
Racing is supposed to be thrilling.

246
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:15,700
No, I mean…

247
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,736
Xu, you better look at this.

248
00:12:19,679 --> 00:12:20,779
<i>On a day of this temperature,</i>

249
00:12:20,779 --> 00:12:21,820
<i>being this close will make his car</i>

250
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:23,380
<i>inhale too much hot air from the car ahead,</i>

251
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,639
<i>which can lead to overheating.</i>

252
00:12:25,919 --> 00:12:27,340
T-The temperature…

253
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:29,580
Just stop chattering and watch, alright?

254
00:12:29,580 --> 00:12:32,039
Alright. It's her first time
watching a car race this close.

255
00:12:32,039 --> 00:12:33,056
It's normal for her to be nervous.

256
00:12:34,944 --> 00:12:36,704
<i>[Last Lap]</i>

257
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:39,380
The race has come to the last lap.

258
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:42,280
With the support of a world-class team today,

259
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:44,420
Lu Yunhao has performed very maturely
without a single flaw

260
00:12:44,420 --> 00:12:45,780
throughout the race.

261
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,140
But he has obviously felt

262
00:12:47,140 --> 00:12:49,340
the immense pressure
brought by Chen Mobai behind him.

263
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,260
If he can't handle the stress later

264
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:52,280
and makes even a slight mistake,

265
00:12:52,280 --> 00:12:53,779
that will be Chen Mobai's opportunity.

266
00:12:53,779 --> 00:12:55,759
Xu Gong, is the car alright?

267
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:59,560
Mobai, the water temperature has been rising.

268
00:12:59,560 --> 00:13:00,759
Don't shift at too high RPMs.

269
00:13:00,759 --> 00:13:02,420
<i>Isn't this slowing me down? What a joke!</i>

270
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:04,500
Do you have any other plans?
Hurry up and think!

271
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:05,940
If this goes on, there will be an accident.

272
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,559
<i>I have also never encountered this situation.</i>

273
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,360
No. I can't see the water temperature.

274
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:13,260
If you can't see it, just ignore it.

275
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,639
Chen Mobai!

276
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:15,879
Avoid the rear of the car in front.

277
00:13:18,272 --> 00:13:19,639
You…

278
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:20,659
Avoid the rear of the car in front.

279
00:13:20,659 --> 00:13:22,860
- What?
- She said to avoid Lu Yunhao's rear.

280
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:24,639
Why are you commanding?
You know nothing about racing.

281
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,080
Stop talking. Let her speak.

282
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:27,940
<i>Shen Xi, what did you just say?</i>

283
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:29,639
Just keep it this way for the straight road.

284
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:30,860
Avoid the exhaust heat

285
00:13:30,860 --> 00:13:32,560
and let fresh air enter the sidepots

286
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,759
<i>to cool the engine.</i>

287
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,759
Can it last by getting some cool air?

288
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:40,860
What happened?

289
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:43,240
Why did Chen Mobai suddenly slow down?

290
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,579
<i>He gave Lu Yunhao the chance to pull ahead.</i>

291
00:13:45,579 --> 00:13:47,000
What if the water temperature doesn't drop?

292
00:13:47,000 --> 00:13:48,719
Mobai, you should stop now.

293
00:13:48,719 --> 00:13:50,020
<i>Your cylinder can burst anytime now.</i>

294
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,579
There are just a few bends left.

295
00:13:51,579 --> 00:13:52,879
I won't quit, even if I have to die.

296
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:55,808
Chen Mobai,

297
00:13:56,879 --> 00:13:58,799
why do you have to
risk your life for a victory?

298
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,440
I don't want to leave any regrets

299
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:04,448
on the racing track.

300
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:10,519
Alright, do as I say.

301
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:15,000
You can't overtake anymore from now on.

302
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,539
First, let your car cool down a bit.

303
00:14:17,539 --> 00:14:19,040
Just maintain this distance

304
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,200
and wait for the right opportunity.

305
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,360
Alright, I'll do as you say.

306
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,019
What did Mobai say?

307
00:14:27,019 --> 00:14:29,039
Mobai said he would do as she said.

308
00:14:29,039 --> 00:14:31,060
What? Did I hear it right?

309
00:14:31,060 --> 00:14:32,120
You…

310
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,559
The last bend is just ahead.

311
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,420
Whether you have confidence or not,

312
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:36,620
you have to brake later than him.

313
00:14:36,620 --> 00:14:37,899
Late braking on such a bend

314
00:14:37,899 --> 00:14:39,000
is a madman's act.

315
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,120
The opponent thinks the same way.

316
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,240
So, he will definitely brake first.

317
00:14:42,919 --> 00:14:44,320
Whoever brakes first loses.

318
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,399
Chen Mobai,

319
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:48,080
do you remember the bet you made before?

320
00:14:48,879 --> 00:14:50,600
Don't stop unless I signal you to.

321
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:53,560
<i>Based on the speed on the straight,</i>

322
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,599
<i>your downforce</i>

323
00:14:54,599 --> 00:14:56,460
<i>is at least 8% higher than Lu Yunhao's.</i>

324
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,120
<i>So your cornering speed
can be 5 km/h faster than his.</i>

325
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,680
<i>This will give you
more late braking time than him.</i>

326
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:05,579
Chen Mobai and Lu Yunhao are in a dead heat.

327
00:15:05,579 --> 00:15:08,000
It's almost time
for the last possible braking point.

328
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,960
But neither of them
is willing to be the first to brake.

329
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:13,260
Junda's advanced braking system

330
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:15,580
may be able to assist Lu Yunhao.

331
00:15:15,580 --> 00:15:17,399
But, at this moment,

332
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,120
<i>the technology is not important.</i>

333
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:21,140
<i>It's a battle over who is mentally stronger.</i>

334
00:15:21,140 --> 00:15:23,120
<i>Is no one willing to step on the brakes?</i>

335
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,699
<i>Both of them are holding on,</i>

336
00:15:24,699 --> 00:15:26,200
<i>waiting for the other to crumble first.</i>

337
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:29,360
This feeling is simply suffocating.

338
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,340
This is a final-level competition.

339
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,639
Although it's thrilling,

340
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,300
if they don't step on the brakes now,

341
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,080
both of them will be in danger.

342
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:37,200
He's simply a madman.

343
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:40,020
Lu Yunhao!
It's actually Lu Yunhao who can't resist.

344
00:15:40,020 --> 00:15:41,839
- Brake!
<i>- He stepped on the brake first!</i>

345
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,120
Chen Mobai has seized

346
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,840
<i>this fleeting opportunity to overtake.</i>

347
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,000
<i>He has moved from 8th place
at the start to first place now.</i>

348
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,799
- Go! Go! Go!
- This is a textbook comeback!

349
00:15:53,799 --> 00:15:55,080
He did it!

350
00:15:55,080 --> 00:15:56,080
You are amazing.

351
00:15:57,879 --> 00:15:59,620
The two cars have come to the final straight.

352
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,580
Who will become the champion

353
00:16:01,580 --> 00:16:04,060
and enter next season's Formula A?

354
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,519
The answer will be revealed shortly.

355
00:16:06,120 --> 00:16:08,280
Now Chen Mobai is leading the race,

356
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,720
and Lu Yunhao has become the chaser.

357
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:12,200
Under normal circumstances, at this stage,

358
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:15,120
the outcome of the race shouldn't surprise us.

359
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:19,279
Xu Gong, the tire blew up.

360
00:16:20,192 --> 00:16:21,260
<i>Did his tire blow out?</i>

361
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:23,960
Chen Mobai was overtaken at the last moment,

362
00:16:25,159 --> 00:16:27,240
and Lu Yunhao crossed the finish line first.

363
00:16:28,279 --> 00:16:31,559
This was indeed an unpredictable race.

364
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:34,120
<i>Just before the finish line,</i>

365
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,060
<i>Chen Mobai, who could have been</i>

366
00:16:36,060 --> 00:16:37,960
<i>the biggest dark horse today,</i>

367
00:16:37,960 --> 00:16:39,900
<i>unfortunately stumbled</i>

368
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:42,639
and handed over the championship to Lu Yunhao.

369
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:45,739
The gap between the two was only 0.6 seconds.

370
00:16:45,739 --> 00:16:47,879
<i>Regrettable. It's too regrettable.</i>

371
00:16:49,159 --> 00:16:50,780
<i>The number of times
Lu Yunhao ran over the curbs</i>

372
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:52,159
<i>was not less than that of Chen Mobai.</i>

373
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:55,440
<i>The tire wear should be similar.</i>

374
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,448
<i>Why was his car</i>

375
00:17:01,504 --> 00:17:02,592
<i>fine?</i>

376
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,240
Chen Mobai came in second.

377
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,539
And the eight annual points he was about to get

378
00:17:07,539 --> 00:17:08,799
now flew away too.

379
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:11,559
But for the audience and racing fans,

380
00:17:11,559 --> 00:17:13,060
today should be a very happy day,

381
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:15,740
as they enjoyed such a classic final.

382
00:17:15,740 --> 00:17:17,760
Let us congratulate Lu Yunhao

383
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:19,359
and Junda.

384
00:17:22,624 --> 00:17:23,744
Wait a minute.

385
00:17:23,744 --> 00:17:24,819
- Mobai
- Mobai.

386
00:17:24,819 --> 00:17:25,824
Mobai.

387
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,400
Thank you so much.

388
00:17:36,256 --> 00:17:37,344
What are you thanking me for?

389
00:17:38,079 --> 00:17:39,519
I didn't help you win the championship.

390
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:42,160
I just wanted to invite you to watch a race.

391
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,840
I didn't expect…

392
00:17:44,448 --> 00:17:45,568
Anyway,

393
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,599
thank you.

394
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:50,140
Although I didn't win the championship,

395
00:17:50,140 --> 00:17:52,720
I don't have any regrets.

396
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,520
I won freely,

397
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,440
and now I lost convincingly.

398
00:18:04,839 --> 00:18:05,888
In fact, you didn't lose.

399
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:09,000
Lu Yunhao's car was against the regulations.

400
00:18:12,359 --> 00:18:13,376
What did you say?

401
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:17,160
He used unregulated tires.

402
00:18:18,079 --> 00:18:19,519
So they didn't blow out on the final straight.

403
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:23,519
In fact, the real champion is you.

404
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,232
How do you know?

405
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,536
I calculated.

406
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,759
Are you serious?

407
00:18:31,759 --> 00:18:32,832
They are currently checking the cars.

408
00:18:33,856 --> 00:18:34,944
I should not be wrong.

409
00:18:35,519 --> 00:18:37,399
Hao Yang, should we appeal?

410
00:18:37,399 --> 00:18:38,920
According to the rules,

411
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,800
if we want to appeal,
it must be within half an hour.

412
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:42,599
Once the time has passed,
the result can't be changed.

413
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:44,640
The time is almost up.

414
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:45,664
Decide quickly.

415
00:18:49,960 --> 00:18:51,279
That's all for today.

416
00:18:51,279 --> 00:18:52,680
Miss Zhao,

417
00:18:52,680 --> 00:18:54,400
as long as we rebuild our team,

418
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,400
we can definitely attract
other excellent racers.

419
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,120
The car program can be implemented.

420
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:00,359
I've made it clear earlier.

421
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,359
The investment depends
on the results of today's race.

422
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,480
But given the current situation,

423
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,260
I can't do anything.

424
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:09,319
- Miss Zhao…
- Miss Mofei, Mr. An.

425
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:11,072
Chen Mobai has appealed.

426
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:13,759
He says that the Junda's tires are illegal.

427
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:15,480
The race results are still pending.

428
00:19:21,039 --> 00:19:22,039
The cars have been inspected.

429
00:19:23,119 --> 00:19:24,400
And now they say our tires have a problem?

430
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,680
Appealing as soon as they fail

431
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:28,759
is an insult to the spirit of the racers.

432
00:19:30,119 --> 00:19:32,799
Young people are too impulsive.

433
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,980
If they've been wronged,

434
00:19:39,980 --> 00:19:42,559
Jiang Yijun won't let it go.

435
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:45,319
If you have nothing to hide,
you have nothing to fear.

436
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:47,799
Whether there's a problem or not,
one look will tell.

437
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:49,856
Right, Mr. Jiang?

438
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:55,920
Of course.

439
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,679
Are you sure you want to appeal?

440
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:58,688
Yes, I'm sure.

441
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:01,900
Chen Mobai, you couldn't beat me on the field,

442
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,599
so you use this underhanded tactic now.

443
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,220
Isn't it pointless?

444
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:07,599
Cut the crap
and bring the tires for inspection quickly.

445
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:09,632
Mr. Mobai.

446
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:13,960
Are you fooling around,

447
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:15,936
or are you serious?

448
00:20:18,912 --> 00:20:19,920
I'm serious.

449
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,319
How are you so sure they violated the rules?

450
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,240
It's okay. You can tell them.

451
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,319
I'll take responsibility for anything.

452
00:20:30,016 --> 00:20:31,136
I calculated it.

453
00:20:33,119 --> 00:20:35,839
The official allocated 12 tires to each team

454
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,239
for practice, qualifying,

455
00:20:38,239 --> 00:20:39,920
and the actual race.

456
00:20:40,599 --> 00:20:41,880
At the final sprint,

457
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,359
Lu Yunhao's left rear tire

458
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,540
had only two millimeters of tread left.

459
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:48,000
The limit of the shock absorber's compression
is ten millimeters.

460
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,800
Combine this with the features of the track,

461
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:50,860
which are four left turns

462
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:52,079
and ten right turns,

463
00:20:52,079 --> 00:20:53,380
plus the temperature,

464
00:20:53,380 --> 00:20:55,519
ground friction, and air resistance,

465
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,360
and we can get the range
of the should-be tire wear

466
00:20:58,360 --> 00:21:00,839
and see Lu Yunhao's tire wear
is below the minimum of that range.

467
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,880
You've calculated tire wear by heart?

468
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:12,928
Who are you?

469
00:21:13,680 --> 00:21:15,200
I am from Ruifeng's administration department.

470
00:21:16,160 --> 00:21:17,559
Ruifeng really has many talents.

471
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:20,640
Even a random clerk
can become a fleet engineer.

472
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:23,360
Victory or defeat is common.

473
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,880
Even if you lose,

474
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:26,659
it's unnecessary to make such a fuss.

475
00:21:26,659 --> 00:21:29,160
Miss Mofei,
is this the tolerance of your family?

476
00:21:31,599 --> 00:21:32,860
I'm the center of the conversation here.

477
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:34,120
Why do you involve my family?

478
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:36,000
Chen Mobai, let me remind you.

479
00:21:36,519 --> 00:21:37,700
The chance of changing the race result

480
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:39,799
through appeals
is always less than one percent.

481
00:21:40,319 --> 00:21:41,760
If the appeal is not substantiated,

482
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:42,919
according to the race rules,

483
00:21:42,919 --> 00:21:44,920
you could be either fined
or banned from racing at worst.

484
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:47,420
Are you sure you want to take such a big risk

485
00:21:47,420 --> 00:21:48,640
and pay such a high price?

486
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:54,200
I am not appealing for the championship.

487
00:21:54,839 --> 00:21:55,840
Then what is it for?

488
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,504
It's for fairness.

489
00:21:59,000 --> 00:22:01,640
Formula racing is about gambling
and adventuring with drivers' lives.

490
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:03,960
It deserves absolute fairness.

491
00:22:04,880 --> 00:22:06,220
Any violations

492
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:08,240
are disrespectful to those

493
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,319
who shed blood and sweat for this sport.

494
00:22:12,359 --> 00:22:13,799
Mr. Mobai,

495
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:15,459
if you want to elevate it to this level,

496
00:22:15,459 --> 00:22:16,720
I have nothing to say.

497
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,480
Anyway, we have nothing to hide.

498
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,440
But let me be clear with you.

499
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,039
Once the investigation results come out,

500
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,759
Junda will never

501
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:28,200
tolerate any defamation,

502
00:22:28,759 --> 00:22:30,680
and we will pursue it to the end.

503
00:22:34,359 --> 00:22:35,559
Let's re-inspect.

504
00:22:35,559 --> 00:22:37,480
But your team participated independently.

505
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,500
To go through the appeal process,

506
00:22:39,500 --> 00:22:41,920
you still need
a third-party company to vouch for you.

507
00:22:44,608 --> 00:22:45,720
Ruifeng will vouch for him.

508
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,640
Miss Mofei,

509
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,680
if this goes wrong,

510
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,320
the impact on our brand

511
00:22:50,320 --> 00:22:51,720
will definitely make our situation worse.

512
00:22:52,759 --> 00:22:54,279
Mr. An, what do you think?

513
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,720
As long as there is a one percent chance,

514
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:04,279
it's better than having no hope, right?

515
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:08,240
I vote for it.

516
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:13,260
This drama is stimulating.

517
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:14,336
I like it.

518
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:18,180
Alright, I'll immediately
arrange for a re-inspection.

519
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,559
Please wait for a moment.

520
00:23:23,359 --> 00:23:25,520
Seriously? Another appeal?

521
00:23:25,520 --> 00:23:27,140
What if Junda actually did violate the rules?

522
00:23:27,140 --> 00:23:28,880
Chen Mobai, I support you.

523
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:31,880
Appealing after losing a match?

524
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:32,960
What a sour loser, huh?

525
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,240
Although Shen Xi really knows the technology,

526
00:23:36,920 --> 00:23:39,240
isn't the success rate too low?

527
00:23:39,960 --> 00:23:41,519
Whether it's 1/1000 or 1/10000,

528
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:43,720
as long as there's unfair behavior,

529
00:23:44,319 --> 00:23:45,440
I will resist to the end.

530
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,240
She believed me
when it was 1/1000 the last time.

531
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:50,519
This time, it's one percent.

532
00:23:51,968 --> 00:23:53,024
I have no reason not to believe her.

533
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,900
Do you think it's an exchange of gifts?

534
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,928
Or return of favors?

535
00:23:59,839 --> 00:24:01,079
At the hearing of the Racing Federation,

536
00:24:01,720 --> 00:24:04,448
she was the one to bring the evidence
at a crucial moment.

537
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,736
Attention, everyone!

538
00:24:09,559 --> 00:24:11,200
I am now announcing an important message.

539
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:14,279
After inspection by the organizing committee,

540
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:17,200
Junda's car was found
with unofficially calibrated tires,

541
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:18,368
and their result was disqualified.

542
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:20,279
Other participants are moved up in rank.

543
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:22,960
In the final race of this season,

544
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:24,576
the champion

545
00:24:26,144 --> 00:24:27,200
is Chen Mobai.

546
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:48,880
Let's invite the champion on stage
to receive the award.

547
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,560
They said my tires were replaced

548
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,200
by the ones
with highly imitated official logos.

549
00:25:00,200 --> 00:25:01,279
Did you do that?

550
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:03,579
I wanted to give your car double insurance.

551
00:25:03,579 --> 00:25:04,719
Just in case, right?

552
00:25:04,719 --> 00:25:06,680
The guaranteed championship is gone.
Don't do this next time.

553
00:25:07,488 --> 00:25:08,512
Chen Mobai.

554
00:25:11,319 --> 00:25:13,119
Thanks for your insistence today. Thank you.

555
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,200
You're welcome. It's what should be done.

556
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,459
I look forward to fighting together again
in Formula A.

557
00:25:19,459 --> 00:25:20,599
Alright, see you in Formula A.

558
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:22,848
Thank you.

559
00:25:42,688 --> 00:25:43,712
Congratulations.

560
00:25:44,359 --> 00:25:45,408
But this trophy

561
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:46,920
is not fully deserved.

562
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:49,860
Winning because of your rival's mistake

563
00:25:49,860 --> 00:25:50,960
is not something to be proud of.

564
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,079
Sorry, I don't understand.

565
00:25:55,480 --> 00:25:57,480
He is saying
he does not acknowledge your victory today.

566
00:25:59,119 --> 00:26:00,680
What is there not to acknowledge?
The result is out.

567
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:04,400
If your opponent is me,

568
00:26:05,599 --> 00:26:07,880
I definitely won't give you such a chance.

569
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:09,504
Alright.

570
00:26:10,784 --> 00:26:11,872
I'll fulfill your wish.

571
00:26:12,799 --> 00:26:14,079
Later in the Formula A Championship,

572
00:26:15,296 --> 00:26:16,384
just wait.

573
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:29,680
Congratulations! You are qualified.

574
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:32,920
About the funding?

575
00:26:33,680 --> 00:26:35,480
Don't worry. My word is my bond.

576
00:26:36,839 --> 00:26:38,640
Weishi's investment in Ruifeng will continue.

577
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:40,799
Your car program can be launched.

578
00:26:41,536 --> 00:26:42,592
Thank you.

579
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:46,279
I think this regained championship

580
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,079
also indicates our cooperation
will see the light after the dark.

581
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,559
I hope I did not make the wrong bet,

582
00:26:53,000 --> 00:26:54,079
whether it is his racing

583
00:26:54,839 --> 00:26:55,936
or your Maituo.

584
00:27:01,248 --> 00:27:02,560
Miss Zhao,

585
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:03,620
at the celebratory party tonight,

586
00:27:03,620 --> 00:27:05,599
Ruifeng Group has an important announcement.

587
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,656
We wish you could be there.

588
00:27:07,296 --> 00:27:08,352
Okay.

589
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:24,680
<i>Will she attend this?</i>

590
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:33,479
Why are you fidgeting all night?

591
00:27:33,479 --> 00:27:35,440
You wouldn't even change your clothes.

592
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,152
Here.

593
00:27:37,152 --> 00:27:38,240
What are you doing?

594
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,296
Put this on.

595
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:40,939
Why should I wear it?

596
00:27:40,939 --> 00:27:42,400
I'm quite comfortable in my T-shirt.

597
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,319
Can't you pay a little attention to your image?

598
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:46,759
This is who I am.

599
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:55,160
Mofei, he is yours now.

600
00:27:57,056 --> 00:27:58,144
Your wine.

601
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,240
Although I don't want to admit it,

602
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:03,720
you did well today.

603
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:05,664
Thanks to you.

604
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:07,920
Otherwise, I would have won
this championship two years ago.

605
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,760
Should I also congratulate you?

606
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:14,119
After all,
the ultimate beneficiary is still you.

607
00:28:15,559 --> 00:28:17,720
Since you've decided to return to Ruifeng,
it's a new beginning.

608
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:24,119
Since you vouched for me today,

609
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,079
I'll begrudgingly accept this beginning.

610
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:36,960
I have something to do and have to leave first.

611
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:46,880
Today at the award ceremony,

612
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:49,024
why did you suddenly leave?

613
00:28:50,880 --> 00:28:52,160
I received a notification

614
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,160
to prepare for the party tonight.

615
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,288
This is what I promised.

616
00:28:57,056 --> 00:28:58,112
Here.

617
00:29:08,039 --> 00:29:09,920
How much is it? I'll transfer the money to you.

618
00:29:10,592 --> 00:29:11,660
Do you think this helmet

619
00:29:11,660 --> 00:29:13,559
can be evaluated in terms of money in my heart?

620
00:29:15,519 --> 00:29:18,640
However, in the future, whenever

621
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,448
there is an important match,

622
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:24,440
just lend it to me for good luck.

623
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:26,208
Why did you keep saying

624
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:29,000
that this helmet

625
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,359
was given to you by Shen Chuan?

626
00:29:38,336 --> 00:29:39,424
<i>Chuan,</i>

627
00:29:40,680 --> 00:29:41,696
<i>do you still remember me?</i>

628
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,840
<i>I am Chen Mobai.</i>

629
00:29:47,079 --> 00:29:48,099
<i>When I was young, it was you</i>

630
00:29:48,099 --> 00:29:49,759
<i>that made me decide
to become a professional racer.</i>

631
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:52,928
<i>At that time, you told me</i>

632
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,880
<i>I would definitely be as great as you were.</i>

633
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,776
<i>I didn't expect to see you again</i>

634
00:30:00,864 --> 00:30:01,984
<i>here.</i>

635
00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:22,799
It feels like a guide in the dark.

636
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,160
At that time, I secretly made up my mind

637
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,039
that I must take good care of this helmet

638
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:34,799
and carry the belief of Chuan

639
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:36,640
to keep going.

640
00:30:37,344 --> 00:30:38,368
Although

641
00:30:39,119 --> 00:30:40,720
it was me who took this arbitrarily,

642
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:43,920
it was raining heavily at that time,

643
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:47,039
and this helmet fell on the ground,

644
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,408
which saddened me.

645
00:31:06,839 --> 00:31:08,279
You can keep this helmet.

646
00:31:10,920 --> 00:31:11,920
Why? Don't you want it?

647
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:14,119
It's not me who broke the promise, right?

648
00:31:14,944 --> 00:31:16,064
You are right.

649
00:31:17,024 --> 00:31:18,048
Probably

650
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:19,920
it really was Shen Chuan

651
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:21,984
who wanted to give it to you.

652
00:31:24,864 --> 00:31:25,888
I must go now.

653
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:27,648
Shen Xi,

654
00:31:33,152 --> 00:31:34,839
do you have a lot of secrets in your heart?

655
00:31:36,768 --> 00:31:37,792
For example,

656
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,488
you are very smart,

657
00:31:40,119 --> 00:31:41,880
but you work
as an administrative staffer in Ruifeng.

658
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,408
Also,

659
00:31:46,079 --> 00:31:47,240
you obviously know car racing well,

660
00:31:49,079 --> 00:31:50,480
but you claim you don't like it.

661
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,200
Racing is too fast.

662
00:31:58,079 --> 00:31:59,920
Now I just want to be a very slow person.

663
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:04,839
What about in the future?

664
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:05,839
What's your plan for the future?

665
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:07,904
I never thought about the future.

666
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,616
It's okay.

667
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:13,248
Take your time to think about it.

668
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:15,680
I have plenty of time to dig deeper.

669
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,240
You said before

670
00:32:21,359 --> 00:32:22,920
that you don't want to leave regrets anymore.

671
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,472
What does that mean?

672
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,260
Mr. Mobai, it's time to announce the signing.

673
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,408
Miss Mofei is looking for you.

674
00:32:38,079 --> 00:32:39,168
Okay.

675
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:45,319
Everyone has the right to keep their secrets.

676
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:49,000
I'll tell you when it's time.

677
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:53,720
I'll take good care of the helmet. Don't worry.

678
00:32:56,832 --> 00:32:57,920
I'm leaving.

679
00:33:09,160 --> 00:33:10,599
<i>[The Tomb of Shen Chuan]
Although the weather is bad today,</i>

680
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,920
<i>we can still celebrate your birthday.</i>

681
00:33:14,079 --> 00:33:15,104
<i>Let's blow out the candle.</i>

682
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:21,920
<i>Wait for me. I'll go get the lighter.</i>

683
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,064
Chuan,

684
00:33:28,064 --> 00:33:30,759
it seems your helmet has found the right owner.

685
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,559
I should go back to my quiet life as well.

686
00:33:37,799 --> 00:33:40,280
In order for her brother
to win the championship,

687
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,839
Chen Mofei is really willing to spend money.

688
00:33:42,759 --> 00:33:44,560
The amount that Manager Guo mentioned

689
00:33:44,560 --> 00:33:45,696
gave me a fright.

690
00:33:46,599 --> 00:33:48,440
You thought it was a sibling relationship?

691
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,839
If the King of Racing had lost,

692
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:53,440
Ruifeng wouldn't have gotten the investment.

693
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:56,559
We didn't take any money and didn't give in,

694
00:33:56,559 --> 00:33:57,759
yet Chen Mobai still won,

695
00:33:58,400 --> 00:34:00,359
proving that he really has strength.

696
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,600
Why did Ruifeng

697
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,760
bother spending so much money
to buy off others?

698
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:09,320
What these business people want is security.

699
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,319
Now that Chen Mobai has returned to Ruifeng,

700
00:34:12,319 --> 00:34:14,880
he'll completely become a racer
who is highly financially supported.

701
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,559
Come one. Cheers.

702
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:22,000
- I've eaten a lot of cake.
- And you didn't even bring me a little.

703
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:24,672
Alright, when we go back to Ruifeng,
we can eat like this every day.

704
00:34:24,672 --> 00:34:25,696
Really?

705
00:34:25,696 --> 00:34:26,752
Where is Chen Mobai?

706
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:28,679
- He went to the toilet.
- Monkey.

707
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:33,719
Where have you been? I've been looking for you.

708
00:34:34,368 --> 00:34:35,424
I went to suffer from cold and hunger.

709
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,679
Once you return to Ruifeng,
you won't need to suffer anymore.

710
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,159
What title should I give myself?

711
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:44,039
How about the executive director of the team?

712
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:47,920
What's with this look?

713
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,879
Ladies and gentlemen,

714
00:34:49,879 --> 00:34:52,340
next, Miss Mofei has a very important matter

715
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:53,660
to announce to everyone.

716
00:34:53,660 --> 00:34:54,840
Please, Miss Mofei.

717
00:34:59,719 --> 00:35:00,960
Good evening, everyone.

718
00:35:02,039 --> 00:35:04,119
Thank you all for attending today's party.

719
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,960
I have good news to announce.

720
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:07,639
Please welcome Chen Mobai

721
00:35:08,199 --> 00:35:10,659
to return to Ruifeng officially.

722
00:35:10,659 --> 00:35:11,744
Great!

723
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:19,519
I think Miss Mofei misunderstood something.

724
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:25,400
When did I say I would return to Ruifeng?

725
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:29,200
What did Mobai say?

726
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,300
He won't return to Ruifeng?

727
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,320
Don't joke around.

728
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:33,984
Chen Mofei,

729
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:37,280
two years ago, you drove me away
for so-called corporate interests.

730
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,440
I thought you had changed.

731
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:42,519
But apparently, you did change.

732
00:35:44,599 --> 00:35:45,980
You became more unscrupulous

733
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,079
for business.

734
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:50,560
Are you crazy? Can't you see where you are now?

735
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,760
What's wrong? You feel embarrassed?

736
00:35:54,639 --> 00:35:56,880
Why didn't you feel embarrassed
when you were buying off drivers?

737
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,619
What? Buying off drivers?

738
00:35:59,619 --> 00:36:00,880
I don't know.

739
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,039
Buying off drivers is not a trivial matter.

740
00:36:03,639 --> 00:36:04,860
Do you know what you're saying?

741
00:36:04,860 --> 00:36:05,920
Let me tell you.

742
00:36:06,559 --> 00:36:08,639
I'm definitely not going back to Ruifeng.

743
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:11,520
I'll prove it to you

744
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,000
that I can still race well on my own
in Formula A.

745
00:36:14,719 --> 00:36:15,960
Racing is about strength,

746
00:36:17,344 --> 00:36:18,400
not scheming.

747
00:36:28,032 --> 00:36:29,056
Don't go.

748
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:30,688
Mobai is angry now.

749
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,400
Must you ride my car?

750
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,400
No.

751
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,220
My car has only four seats.

752
00:37:19,220 --> 00:37:21,480
Chubby takes two seats alone. With the driver,

753
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,760
there's really not enough space.

754
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:25,199
Chen Mobai is really an ingrate.

755
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,240
Without me, there is no him today.

756
00:37:27,240 --> 00:37:28,679
He just leaves without notice.

757
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:38,944
What happened?

758
00:37:40,192 --> 00:37:41,240
A tire blew out.

759
00:37:41,240 --> 00:37:42,920
Aren't you a mechanic? Fix it.

760
00:37:44,352 --> 00:37:45,480
Do you have a spare tire?

761
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,639
A spare tire? I don't need it.

762
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,559
I'm talking about a real spare tire.

763
00:37:54,320 --> 00:37:55,880
And I'm talking about a real spare tire.

764
00:38:06,112 --> 00:38:12,960
<i>[Zhao Yingning: Call for roadside assistance]</i>

765
00:38:17,519 --> 00:38:18,679
You really do have everything,

766
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,440
except a spare tire.

767
00:38:22,679 --> 00:38:24,000
Now we can only call for roadside assistance.

768
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,539
While you were rummaging for a spare tire,

769
00:38:25,539 --> 00:38:26,639
I had already called for it.

770
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,880
Alright, the driver has left.

771
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:38,119
You can call a cab to go home.

772
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,840
As a good team manager,

773
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:47,679
I must tell you
about the importance of a spare tire.

774
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:50,120
Then let me ask you.

775
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:51,440
It's not used regularly,

776
00:38:52,320 --> 00:38:53,339
yet it requires extra care,

777
00:38:53,339 --> 00:38:54,720
taking up more possibilities.

778
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:55,740
Why should I keep it?

779
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,460
Don't underestimate it
for its current uselessness.

780
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,639
It's always there.

781
00:38:59,519 --> 00:39:01,280
From a sociological perspective,

782
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,440
a spare tire always provides

783
00:39:04,280 --> 00:39:05,320
more security than the main one.

784
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,679
With it, you don't have to worry.

785
00:39:08,559 --> 00:39:09,700
When the main tire has an issue,

786
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:11,800
the spare can immediately replace it.

787
00:39:15,400 --> 00:39:17,599
What's the point in that?

788
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,559
It still needs to be replaced in the end.

789
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,440
It's a complete waste of time and space.

790
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,519
Do you know

791
00:39:31,519 --> 00:39:33,079
there's something called a compact spare tire?

792
00:39:34,039 --> 00:39:35,072
It's smaller

793
00:39:35,744 --> 00:39:36,928
and takes up less space.

794
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:47,360
Don't worry.

795
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,719
I will talk to Mobai.

796
00:39:50,592 --> 00:39:51,712
I know him.

797
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:53,920
If he believes we've bought off racers,

798
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,039
he won't come back to sign.

799
00:39:56,559 --> 00:39:57,600
Don't worry.

800
00:39:58,480 --> 00:39:59,599
I will investigate this matter.

801
00:40:01,519 --> 00:40:02,760
When you're stressed,

802
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,544
you're prone to stomachaches.

803
00:40:04,544 --> 00:40:05,696
Remember to drink this.

804
00:40:07,904 --> 00:40:08,960
Thank you.

805
00:40:14,159 --> 00:40:15,296
Come in and have some food.

806
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:19,000
I will tell the nanny
to cook something for you.

807
00:40:22,039 --> 00:40:24,280
No need. You should go home and rest early.

808
00:40:28,672 --> 00:40:29,728
Here's your coat.

809
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:10,760
<i>I've decided not to return to Ruifeng.</i>

810
00:41:16,992 --> 00:41:18,076
<i>Oh.</i>

811
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:25,480
<i>But I will continue to strive for Formula A.</i>

812
00:41:40,736 --> 00:41:41,856
<i>[Qiao Na]</i>

813
00:41:46,048 --> 00:41:47,072
Qiao Na,

814
00:41:47,776 --> 00:41:48,864
can you do me a favor?

815
00:41:49,888 --> 00:41:51,599
<i>[Skyfall Auto Parts]</i>

816
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,639
<i>What's wrong with an independent team?</i>

817
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:55,060
<i>I will form my own team,</i>

818
00:41:55,060 --> 00:41:56,199
<i>find my own sponsors,</i>

819
00:41:56,880 --> 00:41:57,952
<i>and run for Formula A as well.</i>

820
00:42:08,064 --> 00:42:09,184
I've taken the stuff.

821
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:11,040
Thank you, Na.

822
00:42:15,360 --> 00:42:16,416
Mobai,

823
00:42:17,199 --> 00:42:18,360
I didn't get a chance to ask you yesterday.

824
00:42:20,288 --> 00:42:21,400
What happened last night?

825
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:23,520
You suddenly left after dropping a bomb.

826
00:42:23,520 --> 00:42:25,160
And left me with this mess.

827
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:26,640
Do you think Mofei would do that?

828
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:28,060
I heard it with my own ears.

829
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,300
Luckily, they didn't take the money.

830
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,679
Otherwise, we would have
to give back the championship.

831
00:42:31,559 --> 00:42:33,960
Anyway, I don't believe Mofei would do that.

832
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:41,040
If you're not going back to Ruifeng,

833
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,339
how are we going to race in Formula A?

834
00:42:42,339 --> 00:42:43,800
What?

835
00:42:43,800 --> 00:42:45,740
Didn't we live fine without Ruifeng?

836
00:42:45,740 --> 00:42:48,439
No, bro, we have to face reality.

837
00:42:48,439 --> 00:42:51,459
It requires at least ten million a year for us
to participate in Formula A.

838
00:42:51,459 --> 00:42:54,700
Currently, only Ruifeng
has the capability to support you.

839
00:42:54,700 --> 00:42:56,480
No, there's also Junda.

840
00:42:57,199 --> 00:42:59,599
Do you want to be teammates with Lu Yunhao?

841
00:43:05,559 --> 00:43:06,880
I have you.

842
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:09,000
Worse case, you can go find sponsors for us.

843
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:11,296
Ten million?

844
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,520
Where am I going to find that money?

845
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:15,720
Even if the money issue is solved,
what about the other problems?

846
00:43:15,720 --> 00:43:17,500
The level of Formula A

847
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:19,859
is worlds apart from the Formula B
we used to be in.

848
00:43:19,859 --> 00:43:21,160
It's like a battle among gods.

849
00:43:21,160 --> 00:43:22,379
The competition is greater,

850
00:43:22,379 --> 00:43:23,639
and the tech requirements are higher.

851
00:43:23,639 --> 00:43:25,420
Also, the aerodynamic kit
allows for partial modification.

852
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:26,760
Do you really think we can handle all those?

853
00:43:28,128 --> 00:43:29,180
And what's more,

854
00:43:29,180 --> 00:43:30,960
we don't even have a real engineer.

855
00:43:35,400 --> 00:43:36,760
An engineer?

856
00:43:38,016 --> 00:43:39,072
I have someone in mind.
