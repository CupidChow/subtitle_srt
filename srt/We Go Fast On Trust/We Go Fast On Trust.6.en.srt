00:12:08,399 --> 00:12:09,440
you're an expert.

184
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:12,704
No, I am not. I don't know it.

185
00:12:17,248 --> 00:12:18,272
Well,

186
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:21,559

What?

190
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,160
Help me undress.

191
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:44,440
What are you waiting for? Wipe off my sweat.

192
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,879
Wiping sweat is not my job.

193
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:51,712
Just kidding.

194
00:13:52,759 --> 00:13:53,799
Get me a towel from the car.

What are you looking at, Coach Li?

196
00:14:07,840 --> 00:14:09,200
You're that old.

197
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:11,936
You!

198
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,080
I just don't get it.

199
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,799
She seems to know a lot about racing,

200
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,336
but she just denied it.

201
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,600
She instructed them
to adjust the tire pressure.

202
00:14:22,159 --> 00:14:23,200
She's clearly an expert.

203
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:24,759
But she denied it.

204
00:14:26,679 --> 00:14:28,799
She's got something on her mind.

205
00:14:30,799 --> 00:14:31,808
I think so too.

206
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,879
Besides,

207
00:14:33,879 --> 00:14:35,020
she looks familiar to me.

208
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,679
But I can't remember when I have seen her.

209
00:14:37,559 --> 00:14:39,080
Really? You have to think about it.

210
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:43,080

213
00:15:13,399 --> 00:15:14,639
Take a look. Let me find.

214
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:22,240
Mobai, come here.

215
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:24,416
Take a look at this.

216
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,560
It was Shen Chuan's birthday.

217
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,000
I took a picture of him right
after he finished training.

218
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:37,879
Is that what you came up?

219
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:41,159
Then he told me

220
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,480
if he could take another photo.

221
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:56,960
This is…

222
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,559
This is Shen Chuan's sister.

223
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:01,504
Look.

224
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:04,384
That's the girl, right?

225
00:16:15,879 --> 00:16:16,960
D-Do you mean

226
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:18,879
she is Shen Chuan's sister?

227
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:23,159
No wonder she was acting weird.

228
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:26,272
Right.

229
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,600
After Shen Chuan's accident, as his family,

230
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,919
she doesn't want to deal
with these things anymore.

231
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:36,000
Every time she sees it,
she would recall those memories.

It's so late. Why are we still coming here?

That day,

00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:46,800
you asked me why

261
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,440
I would have Markus's stuff.

262
00:18:51,599 --> 00:18:52,640
I'm sorry.

263
00:18:56,200 --> 00:18:57,240
I know

264
00:18:59,079 --> 00:19:00,200
your relationship with Markus,

265
00:19:04,599 --> 00:19:06,440
and why you didn't come to be my engineer.

266
00:19:09,279 --> 00:19:10,720
I didn't mean to hide it,

267
00:19:12,119 --> 00:19:14,200
just don't know how to tell you.

268
00:19:15,552 --> 00:19:16,579

269
00:19:16,579 --> 00:19:18,000
that you are Shen Chuan's sister?

270
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:24,800
I'm sorry.

271
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,640
I always forced you to do this

272
00:19:32,039 --> 00:19:33,599
and asked you to be my engineer.

273
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,779
You must be sad every time

274
00:19:37,779 --> 00:19:38,816
I talk about racing.

275
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:46,480
- I want to say--
- I was wrong about what happened before.

but

284
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,880
it's better to have someone to talk to.

285
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,200
Poor hygiene.

286
00:21:28,079 --> 00:21:30,319
Chen Mobai, are you taking a shower?

287
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:33,640
Why are you throwing your clothes around?

288
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:37,559
Are you done? Come out now.

289
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:51,599
You're addicted to being
Chen Mobai's backup, right?

290
00:21:52,759 --> 00:21:54,319
I don't know it's your plan.

291
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:56,680
And Chen Mobai told me to come.

292
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:58,640
What is he busy at?

293
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,820
Even more important than being here?

294
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:03,200
H-He went to find an engineer.

295
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:05,640
I told him to come to show him

296
00:22:06,359 --> 00:22:08,940
that racing Formula A on his own is a bad idea.

297
00:22:08,940 --> 00:22:11,100
He must have the backing
of the large car companies.

298
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,039
But Chen Mobai has his own persistence.

299
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:15,840
You, the manager!

300
00:22:17,599 --> 00:22:19,480
You get dressed and get out.

301
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,336
Get out.

302
00:22:33,240 --> 00:22:34,660
You told me last time

303
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:37,720
something about high temperatures
and low temperatures, hot and cold,

304
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:42,119
and some rules.

305
00:22:42,680 --> 00:22:44,680
It doesn't apply to relationships at all, okay?

306
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,119
So what applies to relationships?

307
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,599
Ten-second rule.

308
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,088
It means

309
00:22:54,319 --> 00:22:55,680
if two people look each other
in the eye for ten seconds,

310
00:22:57,079 --> 00:23:00,599
they'd know how important
they are in each other's mind.

311
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:03,559
There's no scientific basis at all.

312
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:33,568
See.

313
00:23:37,799 --> 00:23:38,799
Mine didn't ring.

314
00:23:40,599 --> 00:23:41,696
It's yours.

315
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,088
No more rooms.

316
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:08,559
Really. Call the front desk
if you don't believe it.

317
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:12,640
The rooms are all booked up by forum guests.

318

319
00:24:15,460 --> 00:24:17,920

322
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:22,240
No undressing.

323

Don't worry.

324
00:24:24,599 --> 00:24:26,519
You just get some sleep.
I'm not going to do anything.

325
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:29,599

330
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:55,400
Where is your home?

331
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:57,519
My home is over there.

332
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,264
Be careful.

00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:02,000
Over there? Is it over here?

00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:04,740
- I feel dizzy.
- What's wrong? Do you feel dizzy?

335
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,856

<i>My sis lives in building 18, room 402,
at the end of the corridor.</i>

365
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,472
Okay, thank you.

366
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:42,679
Let's go. Go home.

367
00:26:42,679 --> 00:26:44,260
- I can do it.
- Be careful.

368
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,740
I can walk. I can walk on my own.

369
00:26:45,740 --> 00:26:46,920
Okay, go.

370
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:51,319
I can walk on my own.

371
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:57,720
Why would I do so?

372
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,880
I am not drunk.

373
00:27:09,119 --> 00:27:10,200
I can walk on my own.

374
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,680
I can walk on my own.

375
00:27:25,759 --> 00:27:26,784
Chen Mobai.

376
00:27:29,359 --> 00:27:30,400
Sorry.

377
00:27:32,079 --> 00:27:33,440
Why?

378
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:37,839
There's actually something I haven't told you.

379
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:41,664
What?

380
00:27:42,440 --> 00:27:44,480
I am…

381
00:27:47,359 --> 00:27:48,480
What?

382

396

Does it grow?

397
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:23,960
It grows very slowly,

398
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:27,880
could take even thousands of years.

399
00:29:30,359 --> 00:29:32,000
Just like me now,

400
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:35,240
I seem to move forward,

401
00:29:37,359 --> 00:29:39,880

408
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:36,559
What's the matter with you?

409
00:30:37,079 --> 00:30:38,740
I told you to wake me up after two hours.

410
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:39,872
What time is it now?

411
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,400
Don't you know this would hold up my work?

412
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:44,240
I didn't forget.

413
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,240
I knocked,

414
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:48,559
but you were sleeping so soundly,
so I didn't wake you up.

415
00:30:49,079 --> 00:30:51,240
And isn't night the time to sleep?

416
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:53,779
The famous sociologist Max Weber said,

417
00:30:53,779 --> 00:30:56,920
everyone needs sleep to work better.

418
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,820
Every minute of my time is scheduled.

419
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:01,440
You messed up all my plans.

420
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:04,160
Your life is full of plans.

421
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:06,400
Sleep when you're sleepy,
eat when you're hungry.

422
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:08,319
Isn't it more fun to live by your feelings?

423
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,560
Max Weber studied social ethics and economics,

424
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:14,799
not how to rest.

425
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:19,480
Miss Zhao, you really know everything.

426
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:28,224
Sis.

427
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:30,880
You're awake.

428
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:37,319
How's your sleep?

429
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:39,799
Not bad.

430
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:43,720
How did I get home last night?

431
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:45,119
That's what I wanted to ask you.

432
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:48,319
You never drink.

433
00:32:48,319 --> 00:32:50,119
Why did you drink with Chen Mobai yesterday?

434
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:53,839
You two are progressing pretty fast.

435
00:32:56,680 --> 00:32:59,839
Don't worry, I changed
all those clothes for you.

436
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,419
Last night,

437
00:33:02,419 --> 00:33:03,900
Chen Mobai called

438
00:33:03,900 --> 00:33:06,720
and told me to take good care of you.

439
00:33:08,319 --> 00:33:11,280
So before I came,

440
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:13,000
did the two of you

441
00:33:15,440 --> 00:33:16,544
do anything?

442
00:33:24,132 --> 00:33:25,636
<i>[Measuring: 101 bpm]</i>

443
00:33:25,636 --> 00:33:27,972

00:33:29,604 --> 00:33:31,039
<i>[Measuring: 110 bpm]</i>

445
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:32,599
Sis, what's wrong with you?

446
00:33:33,124 --> 00:33:33,860
<i>[Measuring: 113 bpm]</i>

447
00:33:33,860 --> 00:33:35,279
<i>[Measuring: 115 bpm]</i>

448
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:36,559
Are you not feeling well?

449
00:33:37,119 --> 00:33:39,639
<i>[Measuring: 119 bpm]</i>
No, I think my watch is broken.

450
00:33:39,639 --> 00:33:41,339
Is your watch broken

451
00:33:41,339 --> 00:33:43,680
or your heart rate off the chart?

452
00:33:46,960 --> 00:33:48,000
I think

453
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:50,679
Chen Mobai is really considerate.

454
00:33:50,679 --> 00:33:52,060
He said he doesn't know

455
00:33:52,060 --> 00:33:53,319
what you love to eat for breakfast,

456
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:55,400
so he bought you many.

457
00:33:56,079 --> 00:33:57,279
He's quite reliable.

458
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:01,480
So how far have you two progressed?

459
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:05,160
What time is it now? Don't you go to school?

460
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:08,320
Oh my, I'm almost late.

461
00:34:08,832 --> 00:34:09,920
I'm leaving.

462
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:11,840
Keep them in the fridge
if you can't finish them all.

463
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,960
Bring everything.

464
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:15,840
Got it.

465
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,239
You can speed up your life once in a while.

466
00:34:58,432 --> 00:34:59,480
Hello.

467
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:01,399
<i>Shen Xi, your mom is about to have surgery.</i>

468
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:02,496
<i>Come to the hospital now.</i>

469
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,480
I'm really exhausted.

470
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,152
What happened?

471
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,719
I thought you were on a forum.

472
00:35:13,239 --> 00:35:15,159
Zhao Yingning suddenly came to your room,

473
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:17,400
which scared me so much that…

474
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,040
What?

475
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,080
Don't think wildly.

476
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,500
Nothing happened.

477
00:35:21,500 --> 00:35:23,039
I slept on the sofa all night,

478
00:35:23,760 --> 00:35:24,768
and got scolded by her.

479
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:29,039
Thank you for helping me, my friend.

480
00:35:31,119 --> 00:35:32,192
You…

481
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,119
Don't you mind it?

482
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:35,280
What?

483
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:36,559
I don't want to see her at all.

484
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:45,600
What's wrong?

485
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,679
Was it because when driving practice
with Shen Xi yesterday didn't go well?

486
00:35:52,360 --> 00:35:53,440
Well,

487
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,900
if every step I take

488
00:35:56,900 --> 00:35:58,960
is built on the other's pain,

489
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,719
then maybe I should stop.

490
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:03,339
What does that mean?

491
00:36:03,339 --> 00:36:06,240
Didn't things go well according to plan?

492
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,320
Why the pain all of a sudden?

493
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,920
It was me to force her to stay here

494
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:12,180
because I didn't know anything
in the first place.

495
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:13,720
What do you mean?

496
00:36:13,720 --> 00:36:16,840
Shen Xi came on her own because
she owed Mofei's favor, right?

497
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:18,880
She owed her favor?

498
00:36:20,519 --> 00:36:21,660
What is it?

499
00:36:21,660 --> 00:36:23,296
Jiang Wei said,

500
00:36:23,296 --> 00:36:26,139
Mofei paid for Dr. Shen's mother's surgery

501
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:27,180
in the hospital.

502
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:29,679
She couldn't pay it back for a while,
so she took a leave to here.

503
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:33,719
I see.

504
00:36:36,199 --> 00:36:37,399
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

505
00:36:37,399 --> 00:36:38,840
You didn't ask me.

506
00:36:45,719 --> 00:36:47,440
What time is it? Why isn't she here today?

507
00:36:48,576 --> 00:36:49,639
I'll make a call.

508
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:50,752
Don't.

509
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:53,000
What's going on?

510
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,000
If she doesn't want to come, then let her be.

511
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:01,696
She just messaged me.

512
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:06,920
She said she had to take the day off

513
00:37:07,424 --> 00:37:08,460
to go to the hospital.

514
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:10,280
And she said not to tell Chen…

515
00:37:19,552 --> 00:37:20,580
You're finally here.

516
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:21,780
Read the document.

517
00:37:21,780 --> 00:37:23,159
- Okay.
- And sign it.

518
00:37:25,119 --> 00:37:26,980
Why is the surgery suddenly being moved up?

519
00:37:26,980 --> 00:37:28,080
<i>[Linhai People's Hospital, Critical Illness Notification]</i>
She has coronary heart disease,

00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:51,424
I'm fine.

546
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,536
I'm pretty good.

547
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,239
We don't have to be strong all the time,

548
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:06,800
it's okay to cry when you're sad.

549
00:41:47,876 --> 00:41:50,308
<i>[Inpatient Building]</i>

550
00:41:59,079 --> 00:42:00,519
Do we need all these stuff?

551
00:42:02,639 --> 00:42:04,119
It's better to be prepared.

552
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,320
And, after such a major surgery for Auntie,

553
00:42:10,079 --> 00:42:11,480
there are bound to be nursing needs.

554
00:42:12,119 --> 00:42:13,900
It's a lot of trouble

555
00:42:13,900 --> 00:42:15,379
if you can't buy it then.

556
00:42:15,379 --> 00:42:17,559
Alright, don't think too much.

557
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:22,400
Chen Mofei is not someone
who uses favors as leverage.

558
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,488
These days,

559
00:42:24,599 --> 00:42:28,000
you just focus on taking care
of your mom at the hospital.

560
00:42:28,880 --> 00:42:30,079
There's no need to worry about me.

561
00:42:30,719 --> 00:42:32,760
It's me who wants to help Miss Mofei.

562
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:36,280
I met Miss Mofei at the hospital the other day,

563
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:38,280
she was sick at the time,

564
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,340
but still thinking about the difficulties
the company faces.

565
00:42:41,340 --> 00:42:42,496
She…

566
00:42:43,920 --> 00:42:45,159
She is the kind of person

567
00:42:45,159 --> 00:42:46,760
who had to go back to school
and finish the exams

568
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,079
even though she had appendicitis as a kid.

569
00:42:51,840 --> 00:42:54,719
Do you want to think about
going back to Ruifeng?

570
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:58,119
Let me do an upgrade analysis for you.

571
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,440
Don't worry about others.

572
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:02,320
Just take care of yourself.

573
00:43:05,360 --> 00:43:08,199
By the way, why did you

574
00:43:09,360 --> 00:43:11,039
leave me a pot of mung bean sprouts?

575
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,559
You stare at that unchanging crystal every day,

576
00:43:14,519 --> 00:43:16,000
and of course you would
feel like time is standing still.

577
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:20,320
you should spend more time
looking at that mung bean sprout.

578
00:43:21,159 --> 00:43:23,119
Look at how big it grows every day,

579
00:43:23,719 --> 00:43:25,159
that's the rhythm of life.

580
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:31,488
Don't keep yourself trapped.

581
00:43:33,400 --> 00:43:34,880
It hurts the people who care about you.

582
00:43:47,519 --> 00:43:49,159
The doctor would send my mom back soon.

583
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,039
You should probably get back.

584
00:43:57,920 --> 00:43:59,008
You've had a long day too.

585
00:44:00,159 --> 00:44:01,216
Have an early rest.

586
00:44:03,719 --> 00:44:04,768
Chen Mobai,

587
00:44:10,559 --> 00:44:11,584
thank you.

588
00:44:16,280 --> 00:44:17,320
I'm here if you need me.

589
00:44:18,920 --> 00:44:19,936
Have a rest early.

590
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:43,940
<i>♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫</i>

591
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:50,464
<i>♫ The heart gradually silences ♫</i>

592
00:44:51,844 --> 00:44:58,432

593
00:44:58,432 --> 00:45:03,520
<i>♫ I can't delete them ♫</i>

594

595
00:45:10,592 --> 00:45:17,472

00:45:17,472 --> 00:45:25,920
<i>♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫</i>

597
00:45:26,756 --> 00:45:30,752
<i>♫ Fading away ♫</i>

598
00:45:31,908 --> 00:45:38,400
<i>♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫</i>

599
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:44,768
<i>♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫</i>

600
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:53,120
<i>♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫</i>

601
00:45:53,120 --> 00:45:57,472
<i>♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫</i>

602
00:45:57,472 --> 00:46:03,840
<i>♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫</i>

603
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:10,592
<i>♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫</i>

604
00:46:10,592 --> 00:46:17,920
<i>♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫</i>

605
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:27,520
<i>♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫</i>
