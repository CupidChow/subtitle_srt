[Episode 20]

15
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,719
Your shoulder is fine now.

16
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,699
You don't need to come over anymore.

17
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:59,120
I didn't come here for treatment.

18
00:02:08,719 --> 00:02:09,728
This is for you.

19
00:02:12,759 --> 00:02:14,599
This photo should be left at Ruifeng.

20
00:02:15,552 --> 00:02:16,599
It shouldn't be given to me.

21
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,599
No, it shouldn't.

22
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:22,304
But I want to.

23
00:02:34,759 --> 00:02:35,960
Do you have time for a walk?

24
00:02:38,432 --> 00:02:39,456
Just for a while.

25
00:02:41,664 --> 00:02:42,752
Don't worry.

26
00:02:43,919 --> 00:02:46,200
You've talked a lot about the characteristics
of Wings of Wind today.

27
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,319
And I have to go over them when I go back.

28
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:03,439
In return for helping me apply the medicine,

29
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:05,888
I'll tell you a story.

30
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:12,960
Once upon a time,

31
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:16,280
a crocodile

32
00:03:18,039 --> 00:03:20,840
snatched a child from a mother's hands.

33
00:03:23,039 --> 00:03:25,199
The crocodile said to this mother,

34
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,312
answer me a question.

35
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:31,119
If you get it right,

36
00:03:31,119 --> 00:03:32,360
you can have your child back.

37
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:34,080
If you get it wrong,

38
00:03:34,624 --> 00:03:35,639
I'll eat your child.

39
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:38,719
The question the crocodile asked was

40
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,159
"Do you think I'll eat your child?"

41
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,000
The mother's answer was

42
00:03:51,039 --> 00:03:52,160
"Yes".

43
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,560
I know.

44
00:03:59,759 --> 00:04:01,159
This is a classic crocodile paradox.

45
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,039
If the mother was right,

46
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,639
the crocodile would let her child go.

47
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,820
But the outcome of this story

48
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:11,199
proves that the mother was wrong.

49
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,560
The crocodile will eat her child.

50
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:17,439
The mother is caught in a paradox.

51
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,160
So no matter how she answers,

52
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,960
she can't save her child.

53
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:26,208
But at the same time,

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:28,480
the crocodile is also caught in a paradox.

55
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:34,160
Because if it eats her child,

56
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,560
it proves the mother right,

57
00:04:37,519 --> 00:04:39,240
and it has to return the child to her.

58
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,688
So,

59
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:46,720
the crocodile is also caught in the paradox.

60
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,279
When premise and action are cause and effect,

61
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,759
it's easy to create contradiction

62
00:04:57,639 --> 00:04:58,688
or paradox.

63
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:02,879
Just like us now.

64
00:05:14,959 --> 00:05:16,519
If you know this story,

65
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:21,240
you should be able to understand my choice.

66
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,304
This is an impasse.

67
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,079
I tried hard to understand.

68
00:05:34,879 --> 00:05:37,199
However, I later realized that
what the mother did was wrong.

69
00:05:39,648 --> 00:05:40,680
So if it were you,

70
00:05:41,319 --> 00:05:42,464
what would you do?

71
00:05:46,079 --> 00:05:48,279
If it were me and my child was taken away,

72
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:51,220
I would take a stick, drive the crocodile away,

73
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:52,680
and get my child back.

74
00:05:57,519 --> 00:05:59,120
Because when faced with the possibility

75
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:01,120
of losing a loved one, my instinct

76
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:04,320
is to fight.

77
00:06:12,879 --> 00:06:13,879
But I'm not someone

78
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:16,160
who acts on instinct.

79
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,600
No, you are.

80
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,879
Otherwise, why would you
help me modify the data?

81
00:06:20,384 --> 00:06:21,408
I…

82
00:06:23,808 --> 00:06:24,840
I was just…

83
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:27,399
You just wanted to finish
what you were supposed to do.

84
00:06:28,704 --> 00:06:29,792
Right?

85
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:31,800
This reason sounds calm

86
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:34,688
and rational,

87
00:06:37,160 --> 00:06:39,519
but we all know that it's just an excuse.

88
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:44,879
From your fear of danger, I felt love.

89
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:48,544
So,

90
00:06:51,319 --> 00:06:54,279
can we listen to our heart,

91
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,639
and follow our instincts once more?

92
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,319
Don't be bound by the contradictions.

93
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,680
Shen Xi,

94
00:07:10,208 --> 00:07:11,360
give me another chance,

95
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:13,079
and let's drive that crocodile away together.

96
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:27,480
The assessment is tomorrow.

97
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:28,759
You should go to bed early.

98
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:45,760
I just…

99
00:07:49,519 --> 00:07:50,839
I am afraid if I lose tomorrow,

100
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,120
I may not have a chance
to tell you all these things.

101
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:02,112
Good night.

102
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:26,120
Can we listen to our heart,

103
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,399
and follow our instincts once more?

104
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:33,320
Don't be bound by the contradictions.

105
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,320
Passion and obsession

106
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,200
connect us.

107
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,399
But as sweet as a relationship starts,

108
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:53,159
it can end with equal pain.

109
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,480
I thought that the paradox is unbreakable,

110
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,080
so I was stuck and unable to get out.

111
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:03,959
But his instinct

112
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:05,200
was able to break the chains.

113
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,759
Again and again,

114
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,720
we moved on our instincts.

115
00:09:13,152 --> 00:09:14,240
Fear

116
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,100
made me forget the power

117
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,000
brought by those beautiful moments.

118
00:09:20,840 --> 00:09:21,919
But however painful,

119
00:09:22,840 --> 00:09:23,919
no matter much I numb myself,

120
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:25,720
I must admit

121
00:09:27,264 --> 00:09:28,352
that love

122
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,368
didn't disappear.

123
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:52,000
Thank you for introducing us.

124
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:54,240
No problem.

125
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:57,639
These years, parallel imports
have had low sales.

126
00:09:58,159 --> 00:10:00,440
Our company is also transitioning to exports.

127
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,679
If we can really sell Maituo abroad,

128
00:10:03,679 --> 00:10:06,879
Ruifeng and we would have overcome a crisis.

129
00:10:15,456 --> 00:10:16,640
Mr. Anderson.

130
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:18,760
Hi, Mr. Anderson.

131
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:19,840
Hello.

132
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,540
Thank you for taking the time to meet with us.

133
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,568
It's my pleasure.

134
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,740
This is Miss Chen, CEO of Ruifeng.

135
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,200
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

136
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:38,020
I know why you came here. I know your meaning.

137
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:41,320
But I don't want to beat
around the bush anymore.

138
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:42,320
It's a pity.

139
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,679
Because I already have been planning to give

140
00:10:44,679 --> 00:10:47,720
this order to West Asian Company in Italy.

141
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,399
So, you came and waited long for nothing.

142
00:10:56,919 --> 00:10:58,679
Thank you for your precious time, Mr. Anderson.

143
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:01,240
Please, take a look

144
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,960
at our profile before you decide.

145
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,759
I am a pure businessman.

146
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:11,919
And I am straightforward.

147
00:11:12,679 --> 00:11:14,779
I hope Ms. Chen doesn't mind,

148
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:18,159
but I've heard about your conflict
in your Maituo car.

149
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:20,840
Norway

150
00:11:20,840 --> 00:11:23,599
has the highest electric
vehicle penetration rate

151
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,039
in the world.

152
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,240
But the cold weather forces people

153
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,919
into needing to use this kind of machine.

154
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:35,080
Secondly, we need to think

155
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,780
about our reputation.

156
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:38,540
So it doesn't matter

157
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:41,480
what kind of price

158
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,739
you offer to me,

159
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:45,799
we cannot choose your new brand

160
00:11:47,872 --> 00:11:48,919
in the market.

161
00:11:50,039 --> 00:11:51,320
I hope you understand my point.

162
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:55,720
It's true that we don't have
a global reputation yet.

163
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,480
That's why we pay more attention

164
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:01,360
to feedback from market and needs of customers.

165
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,500
You said the Norwegian market

166
00:12:04,500 --> 00:12:06,000
will reject Ruifeng,

167
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,480
but I don't think

168
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:10,280
any customer from any country

169
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:11,799
will reject innovation.

170
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,360
When change happens,

171
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,840
it's also when sortings are disrupted.

172
00:12:21,504 --> 00:12:22,528
Miss Chen.

173
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:27,560
You are an attractive woman.

174
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:30,519
But, business is business.

175
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:34,960
We can only consent to international,
big, high-class brands.

176
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,919
So it does not matter

177
00:12:38,440 --> 00:12:41,240
to lose a damn penny talking about anything.

178
00:12:41,799 --> 00:12:42,880
I'm so sorry.

179
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,660
I still have something to do. I need to go.

180
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,639
And I hope we can have a chance
to cooperate in the future,

181
00:12:51,639 --> 00:12:53,440
but not now, I'm sorry.

182
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:54,519
Thank you.

183
00:12:54,519 --> 00:12:55,820
Thank you.

184
00:12:55,820 --> 00:12:56,919
Nice to meet you.

185
00:12:58,208 --> 00:12:59,328
Bye bye.

186
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,120
This old man is really straightforward.

187
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,159
I'm sorry, Miss Mofei.

188
00:13:06,679 --> 00:13:07,720
I couldn't help you.

189
00:13:08,960 --> 00:13:10,720
Thanks to you, I got to know this news.

190
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:13,840
It's okay. I'll try harder.

191
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:42,496
It's okay.

192
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,600
We can find another way.

193
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:48,879
I won't give up easily.

194
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:54,559
Any news from Mobai?

195
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,600
He was selected and will test-drive
Wings of Wind today

196
00:13:58,399 --> 00:13:59,488
for the final comparison.

197
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,904
But,

198
00:14:04,799 --> 00:14:06,200
the weather forecast in Shanghai

199
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,128
seems to indicate rain.

200
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,919
The forecast says there will be a storm.

201
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,799
Nick asked for your opinion.

202
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,120
Do you want to participate
or request a postponement?

203
00:14:28,320 --> 00:14:30,440
If Mitsui doesn't want to postpone,
why would I want to?

204
00:14:31,679 --> 00:14:32,679
I'm not here to yield.

205
00:14:34,759 --> 00:14:37,000
Your past performances on rainy days were bad.

206
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,032
That was before.

207
00:14:40,768 --> 00:14:41,799
Things are different now.

208
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:46,464
You…

209
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:49,440
Do you have something to say?

210
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:55,200
I do have some personal reasons.

211
00:14:58,840 --> 00:14:59,960
On the track that you'll be driving on,

212
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:03,799
Shen Chuan scored 29 minutes,

213
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:06,000
38 seconds, and 225.

214
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,120
My score was 29 minutes, 40 seconds, and 542.

215
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:12,840
Both are all rainy-day results.

216
00:15:18,240 --> 00:15:19,520
I see.

217
00:15:20,919 --> 00:15:22,919
You want to see how fast
I could drive in the rain,

218
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,344
and then,

219
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,080
make me lose to you fair and square.

220
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:33,152
Quite the contrary,

221
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:36,639
I hope you can achieve the fastest time

222
00:15:37,799 --> 00:15:38,960
under the best conditions.

223
00:15:40,544 --> 00:15:41,632
Chuan and I

224
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,519
have been waiting for a new opponent
who can defeat us.

225
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,520
I noticed that those of you who have made
your way into the Super Grand Prix

226
00:15:47,520 --> 00:15:48,679
are all seeking opponents.

227
00:15:50,759 --> 00:15:52,360
The word retreat has never
been in my dictionary.

228
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,879
Who says that the best conditions
make the fastest time?

229
00:15:56,032 --> 00:15:57,056
Rest assured.

230
00:15:58,279 --> 00:15:59,488
I am Chen Mobai.

231
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,208
And that's the Wings of Wind.

232
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:08,384
You haven't changed.

233
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,320
Well then, good luck.

234
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:21,248
Chen Mobai.

235
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:25,240
Get in the car. I have something to tell you.

236
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:37,639
Don't tell me

237
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:42,600
you're here to persuade me to postpone.

238
00:16:47,104 --> 00:16:48,128
Quite the contrary,

239
00:16:48,759 --> 00:16:51,559
I hope you can make the decision
that goes with your heart.

240
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:53,799
Don't hesitate.

241
00:16:53,799 --> 00:16:55,080
To drive or not, it's your choice.

242
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:58,080
I just want to let you know

243
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,759
you don't need to compete with anyone else.

244
00:17:01,159 --> 00:17:02,480
Your only opponent is yourself.

245
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,320
I've also said

246
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,936
that I want

247
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,920
to truly drive on a rainy day.

248
00:17:22,119 --> 00:17:23,440
I think I've been hiding for long enough.

249
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:28,279
This time, no matter who it's for,

250
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:33,960
I want to challenge myself.

251
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,279
I think my mother would be happy to know.

252
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:50,368
The weather changes instantly.

253
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:53,440
Every driver has different goals.

254
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,279
I think the precondition for listening to fate

255
00:18:01,519 --> 00:18:02,592
is to do your best first.

256
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:05,640
So, is your end goal

257
00:18:06,519 --> 00:18:07,799
still the Super Grand Prix?

258
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,016
Here, take this.

259
00:18:25,960 --> 00:18:27,359
You've said

260
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:29,319
that my brother's helmet can bring you luck,

261
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:30,944
so I brought it for you.

262
00:18:33,839 --> 00:18:34,976
Perhaps,

263
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,319
you can really defeat the crocodile.

264
00:18:40,448 --> 00:18:41,536
Good luck.

265
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,240
Shaoqian.

266
00:18:57,240 --> 00:18:58,400
Are you really sure?

267
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:02,079
Your opinion is to continue the test drive?

268
00:19:06,119 --> 00:19:08,480
Nick, it rains on race days.

269
00:19:09,759 --> 00:19:10,759
We chose them for a reason.

270
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:13,680
They can handle it.

271
00:19:15,839 --> 00:19:16,960
And you, Shen Xi?

272
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,119
What do you think?

273
00:19:23,240 --> 00:19:24,920
Rain changes everything.

274
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,319
Wind, vision, traction.

275
00:19:29,880 --> 00:19:31,359
These are not good conditions

276
00:19:31,359 --> 00:19:32,640
for our first test.

277
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,640
But drivers must deal with changes.

278
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:42,300
And engineers

279
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:43,839
must believe in their designs.

280
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,400
Nick.

281
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,400
We should be brave.

282
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:50,839
You have changed. Shen Xi.

283
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:20,359
Number one driver, please get ready.

284
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,839
Number one driver, get ready.

285
00:20:56,608 --> 00:20:57,632
Thank you.

286
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:04,768
Don't worry.

287
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:06,880
Whether to drive in the rain,

288
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,279
Mobai will make his own judgment.

289
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,599
That incident has been long enough.

290
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:16,352
I don't hope

291
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,240
it still affects him.

292
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:23,776
It's been so many years.

293
00:21:24,759 --> 00:21:26,119
Have you never thought

294
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:28,039
about telling him the truth?

295
00:21:30,799 --> 00:21:32,480
I hope he never finds out.

296
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,200
I'm quite scared of rainy days.

297
00:21:47,599 --> 00:21:49,680
Because the race track
on a rainy day is full of variables.

298
00:21:50,759 --> 00:21:52,000
Just because of the rain,

299
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,799
I lost several championships.

300
00:21:55,319 --> 00:21:56,680
Later,

301
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:57,900
my mother intentionally

302
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,440
took me to practice driving on rainy days.

303
00:22:00,759 --> 00:22:01,888
Let's go.

304
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:06,688
Shen Xi.

305
00:22:08,119 --> 00:22:09,344
Wait for me at the finish line.

306
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:23,640
Mom really loved him.

307
00:22:25,319 --> 00:22:26,720
As long as he wanted to go out for practice,

308
00:22:27,839 --> 00:22:29,640
even if it was raining knives,
Mom would accompany him.

309
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:34,079
That day,

310
00:22:36,119 --> 00:22:37,184
it was raining.

311
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,960
He was afraid of delaying the training process,
so he went anyway.

312
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,400
The road was all flooded.

313
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,319
You could see nothing but the road.

314
00:23:18,519 --> 00:23:20,680
The traffic light at that intersection
just didn't light up.

315
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,720
A large truck rushed from the side,

316
00:23:31,519 --> 00:23:32,880
and they were frozen with shock.

317
00:23:36,279 --> 00:23:38,359
I reached out and grabbed the steering wheel.

318
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:41,559
Perhaps it was because of this action,

319
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:46,140
Mobai has subsequent memories,

320
00:23:46,140 --> 00:23:48,279
thinking I was the one driving that day.

321
00:24:56,759 --> 00:24:58,640
We've missed the best time for rescue.

322
00:24:59,559 --> 00:25:01,000
If she could have been here
three minutes early,

323
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,599
perhaps we could have done something.

324
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,000
I don't know what happened.

325
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:18,960
But his silhouette told me,

326
00:26:20,672 --> 00:26:21,792
that now,

327
00:26:22,720 --> 00:26:24,000
I should leave him alone.

328
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:19,359
So you've been hiding it from him all along,

329
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:22,359
You'd rather let him misunderstand you

330
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,320
and blame you.

331
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,839
It's not really a misunderstanding.

332
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,960
I hope he never remembers.

333
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:47,839
We need to get him back.

334
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,272
Can you find him?

335
00:27:52,352 --> 00:27:53,472
I'll go talk to them.

336
00:27:53,472 --> 00:27:54,592
Okay.

337
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,048
Mr. Stover.

338
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,460
Chen Mobai's final time

339
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,279
is 29: 42, 231.

340
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:12,799
That's 45 milliseconds faster than Mitsui.

341
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:17,599
As for a first-time Formula A
driver of Wings of Wind,

342
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,319
both of them are very talented.

343
00:28:21,079 --> 00:28:23,119
Both of them are promising.

344
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,760
But my point is,

345
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,160
as you always say,

346
00:28:29,359 --> 00:28:33,920
the driver's performance is important,
but it's one thing.

347
00:28:34,599 --> 00:28:38,039
On the other side, we have the mental attitude

348
00:28:39,119 --> 00:28:42,440
and the consistency on the race

349
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,680
that matters and should be considered.

350
00:28:48,704 --> 00:28:49,799
Yes, yes.

351
00:28:50,319 --> 00:28:51,519
On that level,

352
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:54,240
Mitsui is in a stable condition.

353
00:28:55,319 --> 00:28:58,559
But Chen Mobai, obviously,
is not doing very well.

354
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,039
That's what I'm saying.

355
00:29:01,920 --> 00:29:03,040
He's fast,

356
00:29:03,839 --> 00:29:04,896
very fast,

357
00:29:05,759 --> 00:29:08,920
but recently, he's made
many mistakes on the field.

358
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:10,656
And where is he now?

359
00:29:11,319 --> 00:29:12,448
How is it possible

360
00:29:13,079 --> 00:29:15,000
that he just disappears randomly?

361
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:20,440
Mr. Stover,

362
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:22,272
let me explain.

363
00:29:23,880 --> 00:29:26,279
He's unwell for personal reasons.

364
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:29,839
I am very sorry.

365
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:32,992
First,

366
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:34,400
take a rest.

367
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,559
I understand what you're saying.

368
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:40,480
But my opinion is

369
00:29:41,400 --> 00:29:44,440
his inconsistency with the team

370
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:46,680
is more fatal

371
00:29:47,359 --> 00:29:49,359
than 0.45 seconds slower.

372
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:53,559
So I think and I decide to take Mitsui Taku

373
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,519
as the driver of Wings of Wind.

374
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,279
No other opinion, right?

375
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:00,544
Mr.Stover.

376
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:02,799
Before we make our final decision,

377
00:30:03,960 --> 00:30:05,720
I'd like to direct your attention to page two.

378
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,056
Please.

379
00:30:11,079 --> 00:30:12,860
These are Chen Mobai's individual lap times.

380
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:13,920
Okay.

381
00:30:14,440 --> 00:30:15,488
Take a look at the last one.

382
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,799
One minute, 12 seconds, 220.

383
00:30:23,072 --> 00:30:24,192
Shaoqian.

384
00:30:24,839 --> 00:30:27,119
This is way higher than Mitsui.

385
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:31,280
And it is 0.1 seconds faster

386
00:30:31,280 --> 00:30:33,599
than the lap record you have in here.

387
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:36,320
And today, it's raining.

388
00:30:37,240 --> 00:30:39,600
What about Shen Chuan?

389
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:42,039
What was his fastest lap?

390
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:45,599
One minute, 12 seconds, 187,
in the right weather.

391
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:48,480
Given the right weather,

392
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:50,519
he might even beat Shen Chuan.

393
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:54,160
My question is that Chen Mobai,

394
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:56,799
is he a genius

395
00:30:58,680 --> 00:30:59,776
or a madman?

396
00:31:03,079 --> 00:31:04,720
Sir, listen to me, please.

397
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:08,400
A driver should be judged
by the best that he can do.

398
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,920
I believe in Chen Mobai's potential.

399
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:16,599
I will bring him back. I swear.

400
00:31:18,519 --> 00:31:19,616
Trust me.

401
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,712
Okay.

402
00:31:25,599 --> 00:31:28,940
I must retract what I said before.

403
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:30,240
If Dr. Shen

404
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,599
can convince him,

405
00:31:33,200 --> 00:31:34,680
we, at Markus,

406
00:31:35,319 --> 00:31:37,279
are willing to open the doors

407
00:31:37,839 --> 00:31:40,839
for our crazy genius.

408
00:31:45,079 --> 00:31:47,000
Dr. Shen, why did you suddenly call me?

409
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:49,039
How is Mobai doing in training, has he made it?

410
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:52,640
Chen Mobai has left the training camp.

411
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:55,519
I'm going to check if he has
bought a ticket back to Linhai.

412
00:31:56,160 --> 00:31:57,580
No, what happened to him?

413
00:31:57,580 --> 00:31:59,160
Wasn't he in intensive training?
Why did he leave?

414
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,360
There has been an emergency.

415
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,799
Can you help me check first?

416
00:32:03,392 --> 00:32:04,419
Alright, alright.

417
00:32:04,419 --> 00:32:06,720
His usual utilities, water and gas bills

418
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:07,819
are all handled by me.

419
00:32:07,819 --> 00:32:08,896
Let me take a look.

420
00:32:11,328 --> 00:32:12,420
I got it.

421
00:32:12,420 --> 00:32:14,720
He bought an airplane ticket
half an hour ago back to Linhai.

422
00:32:15,559 --> 00:32:17,280
Okay, got it.

423
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,720
I'll go buy a plane ticket to Linhai right now.

424
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:20,480
Okay, I see.

425
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:28,440
You're going back?

426
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:29,984
Sorry, Shaoqian.

427
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:31,936
I have to go.

428
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,000
Okay.

429
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:37,920
Take care.

430
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:04,576
Hello, Hao Yang.

431
00:33:05,519 --> 00:33:06,700
Is Chen Mobai back in the workshop?

432
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:08,880
No, he's not. I stayed up all night.

433
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,300
Xu Gong went to look in the car team
but he couldn't find him.

434
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,559
What's going on with him?
He's not even answering his phone.

435
00:33:14,119 --> 00:33:15,839
Did you check all the places
he usually hangs out?

436
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:18,040
Yes, I checked them all.

437
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,680
Monkey also went to the go-cart site.

438
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,039
Well…

439
00:33:22,039 --> 00:33:23,319
Are there any other places

440
00:33:23,319 --> 00:33:25,079
that are unusual but we may have omitted?

441
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,040
Where else could it be?

442
00:33:29,720 --> 00:33:32,160
I think I know where he might be.

443
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:34,799
I'll contact you later.

444
00:33:37,359 --> 00:33:38,799
Driver, can you turn around?

445
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,360
Have you been here alone for a while?

446
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,699
Let's go home, alright?

447
00:34:23,699 --> 00:34:25,519
I killed my mom. I was driving.

448
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:33,440
My driving killed my mom.

449
00:34:38,039 --> 00:34:40,320
Yet I still naively wanted
to make up for those three minutes.

450
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:49,679
I've been deceiving myself
with speed all along.

451
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:53,568
Chen Mobai,

452
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,440
you won the race.

453
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,119
You've proven yourself.

454
00:35:01,639 --> 00:35:03,159
And you've made up for those three minutes.

455
00:35:05,024 --> 00:35:06,112
What did I win?

456
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:11,199
Was it the eligibility as a racer
in the Super Grand Prix?

457
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,599
Or those three minutes that I
thought I had already recovered?

458
00:35:22,079 --> 00:35:23,168
Shen Xi…

459
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:28,599
I don't deserve anything.

460
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,904
What?

461
00:35:37,519 --> 00:35:38,679
What am I competing against?

462
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:42,599
What exactly am I trying to prove?

463
00:35:46,519 --> 00:35:48,239
I am absolutely not fit
to be a race car driver.

464
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,000
I should have died that day.

465
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,599
- Mobai, you've finally come back.
- Mobai.

466
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,559
What's wrong with him?

467
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,860
Give him some time first.

468
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,180
Let him rest well.

469
00:37:06,180 --> 00:37:08,480
Could it be that Mobai lost

470
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:09,599
and can't accept it right now?

471
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,200
He didn't lose.

472
00:37:11,968 --> 00:37:13,024
He won.

473
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,440
I'll leave Chen Mobai in your hands for now.

474
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,152
I need to go find Miss Mofei now.

475
00:37:18,320 --> 00:37:19,960
Let me know immediately if anything happens.

476
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,719
If he won,

477
00:37:25,719 --> 00:37:27,519
why is he acting like this?

478
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:29,880
Shouldn't he be able to participate

479
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:31,000
in the Super Grand Prix now?

480
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,920
What's going on?

481
00:37:50,679 --> 00:37:51,680
I have an announcement.

482
00:37:53,888 --> 00:37:55,072
I'm not going to the Super Grand Prix.

483
00:37:56,039 --> 00:37:58,700
Mobai, you're not in a good state now.

484
00:37:58,700 --> 00:38:01,300
Why don't you rest a bit, calm down
and then we can talk about it?

485
00:38:01,300 --> 00:38:02,464
I'm very calm.

486
00:38:04,280 --> 00:38:05,376
Let alone the Super Grand Prix.

487
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,288
I'll quit racing.

488
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,519
Okay.

489
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:12,360
Even if we don't race,
we can open a car repair shop.

490
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:13,536
We can still be together.

491
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,000
What's wrong? What's going on?

492
00:38:20,352 --> 00:38:21,440
What happened to you?

493
00:38:22,592 --> 00:38:23,648
This place

494
00:38:24,199 --> 00:38:25,360
from now on, will be a car modification shop.

495
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:29,440
Whoever wants to stay can stay.

496
00:38:30,048 --> 00:38:31,104
If you don't want to stay,

497
00:38:31,679 --> 00:38:32,719
you can switch to another racing team.

498
00:38:33,719 --> 00:38:35,280
As for Ruifeng,

499
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:36,800
I'll let you know

500
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:38,528
after I finish tidying up here.

501
00:38:39,239 --> 00:38:40,280
Why are you giving up on things

502
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,000
after the special training?

503
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,392
Chen Mobai.

504
00:38:50,464 --> 00:38:51,480
Chen Mobai.

505
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,360
I've never seen you like this
since we were young.

506
00:38:56,384 --> 00:38:57,480
I know what kind of person you are.

507
00:38:57,480 --> 00:38:59,119
You didn't mean it, did you?

508
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:02,464
What kind of person am I?

509
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,119
I don't even know who I am.

510
00:39:07,719 --> 00:39:09,480
Of course, I know who you are.

511
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:12,940
You are a race car driver who never backs down.

512
00:39:12,940 --> 00:39:14,599
I was never worthy of being a racer.

513
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:17,984
Chen Mobai.

514
00:39:19,159 --> 00:39:20,719
Ever since you were in school,

515
00:39:20,719 --> 00:39:22,960
your mind was filled with racing, racing.

516
00:39:23,519 --> 00:39:25,239
Why are you not worthy?

517
00:39:28,159 --> 00:39:29,379
What do you want to do if you're not racing?

518
00:39:29,379 --> 00:39:30,400
Will you always be repairing cars?

519
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,320
We'll see about that.

520
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,760
Chen Mobai, stand up.

521
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,840
Stand up.

522
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:40,599
I don't want to see you so dispirited.

523
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:42,179
- What's wrong with you?
- Calm down, calm down.

524
00:39:42,179 --> 00:39:44,440
Miss Zhao, he must have his reasons.

525
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,440
- Come out first.
- Chen…

526
00:39:46,679 --> 00:39:47,720
Stop. Come out with me now.

527
00:39:47,720 --> 00:39:49,559
Just leave him alone for now.

528
00:40:26,800 --> 00:40:27,840
So he

529
00:40:28,864 --> 00:40:29,920
remembered everything.

530
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,960
You have been hiding this
from him for so many years.

531
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:37,440
Were you afraid he couldn't take it?

532
00:40:38,976 --> 00:40:40,000
I'm afraid he'll…

533
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:45,119
The fewer the people who remember,
the less the pain.

534
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,760
I can bear this burden on my own.

535
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,720
Post-traumatic stress disorder

536
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:54,660
can lead to memory confusion.

537
00:40:54,660 --> 00:40:56,000
This is mostly likely because

538
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,079
the self-blame in his heart
is almost overwhelming him

539
00:40:58,599 --> 00:41:00,559
and his brain is choosing to protect itself.

540
00:41:02,159 --> 00:41:03,920
What will this do to his body?

541
00:41:04,679 --> 00:41:06,439
This is a mental issue.

542
00:41:06,439 --> 00:41:08,280
It won't harm his body.

543
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,960
But if forcefully corrected,

544
00:41:09,960 --> 00:41:11,800
it may cause the memory to be more disordered.

545
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,600
There is even a risk of total mental breakdown

546
00:41:15,600 --> 00:41:17,840
due to being unable to face reality.

547
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:23,968
Doctor.

548
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:27,200
So if we

549
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:28,639
go along with his memories

550
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:31,456
and don't let him remember,

551
00:41:32,519 --> 00:41:33,639
will it be better?

552
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,419
Less stimulation now

553
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:39,119
is the best choice for him.

554
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,400
How is he doing now?

555
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:46,000
You should go see him.

556
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:50,496
But I'm afraid

557
00:41:50,496 --> 00:41:51,559
if he sees me…

558
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:53,440
The person he wants to see

559
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,639
and lacks the courage to see the most

560
00:41:58,208 --> 00:41:59,264
is you.

561
00:43:05,267 --> 00:43:09,747
♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫

562
00:43:11,667 --> 00:43:16,271
♫ The heart gradually silences ♫

563
00:43:17,651 --> 00:43:24,239
♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫

564
00:43:24,239 --> 00:43:29,327
♫ I can't delete them ♫

565
00:43:30,387 --> 00:43:36,399
♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫

566
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:43,279
♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫

567
00:43:43,279 --> 00:43:51,727
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

568
00:43:52,563 --> 00:43:56,559
♫ Fading away ♫

569
00:43:57,715 --> 00:44:04,207
♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫

570
00:44:04,207 --> 00:44:10,575
♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫

571
00:44:12,051 --> 00:44:18,927
♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫

572
00:44:18,927 --> 00:44:23,279
♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫

573
00:44:23,279 --> 00:44:29,647
♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫

574
00:44:29,647 --> 00:44:36,399
♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫

575
00:44:36,399 --> 00:44:43,727
♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫

576
00:44:43,727 --> 00:44:53,327
♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫
