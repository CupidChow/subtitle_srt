pain implies obstruction,

22
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,439

24
00:02:24,224 --> 00:02:25,800

You have a bit of swelling
on the left side of your back.

39

You should be applying ice on it, no massaging.

40

It felt a bit like a bruise.

41
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:33,600
It could become more serious
if you don't attend to it.

42

52
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,199
Shen Chuan gave it to me.

00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:30,840
Haven't you already appealed
that it was a vehicle malfunction?

182
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:33,000
In about a week,

183
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,399
we will hold a joint hearing.

184
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,399
At that time,

185
00:14:37,399 --> 00:14:40,519
bring the accident vehicle inspection report.

186
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:41,900
If it can be verified as true,

187
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:44,219
as the Racing Federation,
we can issue a statement

188
00:14:44,219 --> 00:14:45,660
to eliminate the negative impact.

189
00:14:45,660 --> 00:14:46,848
Okay.

190
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,120
See you at the hearing in a week.

191
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,559
Then you will give me the result.

192
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:53,184
No problem.

193
00:15:04,919 --> 00:15:07,200
But it's not an easy thing to do.

194
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Why are you doing that?

195
00:15:11,399 --> 00:15:12,960
What exactly is going on?

196
00:15:12,960 --> 00:15:15,968
The problem is,
it's a bit difficult to check this car.

197
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:18,080
Even if it's from Ruifeng.

198
00:15:18,679 --> 00:15:20,880
If the consumer has safety doubts,
we should check it.

199
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:21,960
You're right.

200
00:15:22,879 --> 00:15:23,904
But...

201
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:26,559
I'm not the owner.

202
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,840
This car is not yours.

203
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:32,700
Say it again, whose car is this?

204
00:15:32,700 --> 00:15:34,639
Do you think that after buying this place,

205
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,859
I would still have money left?

206
00:15:35,859 --> 00:15:38,260
My small wedding house
is only sixty square meters.

207
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,600
At that time, Jiang Wei helped us.

208
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:41,919
The car is free to use.

209
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:44,759
If I don't take the bargain, I'll be crazy.

210
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,480
I understand.

211
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:52,160
Chen Mofei must be behind this.

212
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:53,919
No way. She's your sister.

213
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:57,060
What I mean is, as soon as I got this car,

214
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:58,880
I checked it inside and out.

215
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:00,080
And it's been running for so long now.

216
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:01,480
If there was a problem,
it would have shown up a long time ago.

217
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:10,656
Brother Mobai, Mr. Mobai.

218
00:16:11,200 --> 00:16:13,240
The urgent task now is to get the race license

219
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:15,940
before the Formula B championship race.

220
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:18,920
Why don't you go to Miss Mofei

221
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:20,799
and ask her for an inspection authorization?

222
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,400
I won't.

223
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:25,080
You still care about things from the past?

224
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:26,580
She didn't like me racing.

225
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,300
I won't humiliate myself.

226
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:29,376
Then I'll go.

227
00:16:29,376 --> 00:16:30,400
You can't go either.

228
00:16:30,919 --> 00:16:32,120
Nobody should go.

229
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,200
What about the race license?

230
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:12,640
that Rick you guys transferred
to Hao Yang two years ago

231
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,880
is too risky to race in.

232
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,240
I decided to dismiss the Ruifeng Race Team,

233
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,752
effective immediately.

234
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,920
Wei Shi suddenly transferred Eric,

235
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:47,720
sent in a new person to do the assessment.

236
00:17:48,319 --> 00:17:51,200
I heard Zhao Yingning were back
from the U.S. headquarters.

237
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,319
A Stanford graduate.

238
00:17:54,839 --> 00:17:56,960
Became a senior manager
at Morgan Stanley at twenty-four.

239
00:17:57,664 --> 00:17:58,720
Then she went to Wei Shi,

240
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:00,880
became their youngest director

241
00:18:02,279 --> 00:18:03,759
I know Zhao Yingning.

242
00:18:05,079 --> 00:18:06,119
She is Chen Mobai's schoolmate.

243
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:08,640
Zhao Yingning,

244
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,880
is now known as Wei Shi's No.1 killer.

245
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:13,000
She is notoriously tough.

246
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:15,559
Cheng Wei switched the general
before the battle,

247
00:18:16,319 --> 00:18:18,119
he probably wanted to make a big deal

248
00:18:18,784 --> 00:18:19,900
about the R&D overtime of Maituo.

249
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,079
We need to be prepared.

250
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,759
Ever since two years ago,

251
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:27,559
when I decided to take this untrodden path,

252
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,680
we could only press forward.

253
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,880
If Weishi decides to not invest any more,

254
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,079
we would have a serious cash flow issue.

255
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:39,488
I know that.

256
00:18:40,096 --> 00:18:43,240
Besides, Mobai's driver's license
was suspended.

257
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:46,599
He insisted it was because the accelerator
of Ruifeng's car was out of control.

258
00:18:47,599 --> 00:18:49,279
Hao Yang wants us to issue
a car inspection authorization.

259
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,079
Don't bother. Let him be.

260
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:16,559
Long time no see, Baibai.

261
00:19:17,319 --> 00:19:20,539
Zhao Yingning, why are you here?

262
00:19:20,539 --> 00:19:21,559
What's wrong, Mobai?

263
00:19:24,519 --> 00:19:27,039
What is up with you guys making
such a fuss early in the morning?

264
00:19:31,839 --> 00:19:32,839
Why is there a woman?

265
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,319
Oh boy, really, when it rains, it pours.

266
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,920
If I could be like Mobai,

267
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,880
I would have already found a wife.

268
00:19:44,119 --> 00:19:45,184
Thank you.

269
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:47,759
Why did you come back
from abroad all of a sudden?

270
00:19:48,359 --> 00:19:51,540
I came back to work
and to get married by the way.

271
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:52,672
Get married?

272
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:54,880
Congratulations. Who's the groom?

273
00:19:56,079 --> 00:19:57,184
It is you.

274
00:19:58,359 --> 00:19:59,439
Although we grew up together,

275
00:19:59,439 --> 00:20:01,300
we are not so intimate.

276
00:20:01,300 --> 00:20:03,799
Just came back from abroad and
you're cracking such a big joke with me.

277
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:05,824
Who's joking with you?

278
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:10,960
When we were little,
you cut off one of my braids.

279
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:12,699
You said then
that you would agree to one condition.

280
00:20:12,699 --> 00:20:13,799
Anything will do.

281
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:16,319
Oh, come on.
You've held this grudge for too long.

282
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,559
Anyway, besides work,

283
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,159
I have a very important
key performance indicator this time.

284
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:22,079
That is, I must get married before I'm 28.

285
00:20:22,079 --> 00:20:23,640
Time is really tight now.

286
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,519
So why are you coming for me?

287
00:20:28,519 --> 00:20:29,620
I'm too busy.

288
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:31,900
I don't have time
to get to know someone all over again.

289
00:20:31,900 --> 00:20:33,799
You're the man I've known the longest.

290
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:36,460
And from junior high till now,

291
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,759
you've kind of stayed decent.

292
00:20:40,119 --> 00:20:41,599
Well, thanks.

293
00:20:41,599 --> 00:20:43,319
Don't you consider whether
there is emotional foundation between us?

294
00:20:43,319 --> 00:20:45,260
Emotions are the most complex.

295
00:20:45,260 --> 00:20:47,120
There is no standard to measure.

296
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,860
Marriage is the recombination of life's assets.

297
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:51,120
I've assessed it.

298
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:53,020
We are an optimized combination.

299
00:20:53,020 --> 00:20:54,279
Why would you disagree?

300
00:20:56,359 --> 00:20:58,960
I have to work fourteen hours a day this week.

301
00:20:59,480 --> 00:21:01,680
I can only spend two hours on the weekend to take wedding photos.

302
00:21:04,079 --> 00:21:05,320
I'm almost ready for the meeting.

303
00:21:05,320 --> 00:21:07,040
There's a half-hour on the way.

304
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,159
Why don't you drive me there?

305
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:10,260
On the way, we could work on

306
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:11,299
what you call emotion.

307
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:12,480
I'm sorry,

308
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:16,000
my driver's license was just suspended.
I can't drive.

309
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:17,792
Or…

310
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:21,056
Hao Yang,

311
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,552
what about you?

312
00:21:24,079 --> 00:21:25,120
Me?

313
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:28,720
No need. You can drive me next time.

314
00:21:29,680 --> 00:21:30,720
See you. Baibai.

315
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:34,240
"Baibai".

316
00:21:42,112 --> 00:21:43,264
Hao Yang,

317
00:21:43,839 --> 00:21:44,864
come down and I have something to tell you.

318
00:21:47,559 --> 00:21:48,759
The hearing is next week.

319
00:21:49,279 --> 00:21:51,400
When can we get the car inspection report?

320
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:54,079
If we go through the normal vehicle
inspection process,

321
00:21:54,079 --> 00:21:55,360
it definitely won't be ready
in time for the hearing.

322
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:57,080
Since you're reluctant to go to ask Mofei,

323
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:59,160
then we have to find someone
who can control her.

324
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:01,280
The chairman.

325
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,304
That's all?

326
00:22:03,359 --> 00:22:05,140
You've thought half a day to come up with this.

327
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:07,880
There is a famous sociologist
in Europe who said

328
00:22:07,880 --> 00:22:11,160
every grandfather comes from a grandson.

329
00:22:11,160 --> 00:22:13,240
Which sociologist?

330
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,020
This is not important. What's important is

331
00:22:15,020 --> 00:22:16,340
it tells us

332
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,839
A man knows when to yield and when not
in the critical moment.

333
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:23,400
Didn't the chairman recently stay
in the hospital for treatment?

334
00:22:24,119 --> 00:22:25,559
Why not bring some gifts to him and see?

335
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,279
<i>[A sight for sore eyes]</i>

336
00:22:29,279 --> 00:22:30,640
Do you think he could help me?

337
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,640
<i>This is the resignation gift from the chairman.</i>

338
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:36,292
<i>[A sight for sore eyes]</i>

339
00:22:40,599 --> 00:22:42,600
Wasn't that written
by the old man two years ago?

340
00:22:42,600 --> 00:22:43,960
Perhaps he has forgotten it.

341
00:22:47,748 --> 00:22:50,359
<i>[People's Hospital of Linhai City]</i>

342
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:51,599
There 's still no progress recently.

343
00:22:52,559 --> 00:22:54,079
Duanmu Kuan and his team

344
00:22:54,079 --> 00:22:55,840
are still striving to conquer the

345
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:57,119
multi-layer structure technology
of lithium-ion batteries.

346
00:23:00,359 --> 00:23:01,759
if we really make it,

347
00:23:02,519 --> 00:23:04,440
it would be a epoch-making progress

348
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:07,119
for the electric car industry.

349
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,120
But it's also the hardest task.

350
00:23:11,279 --> 00:23:13,559
What? Have you lost confidence?

351
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,088
I won't, Dad.

352
00:23:18,079 --> 00:23:19,599
Half of the people who have embarked on a one
hundred mile journey may fall by the way side.

353
00:23:20,599 --> 00:23:23,359
if we also buy batteries to manufacture cars,

354
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,519
Maituo would have been failed.

355
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,860
But you've taught me since childhood

356
00:23:27,860 --> 00:23:30,519
compared to commercial success,
what's more worth striving for

357
00:23:31,559 --> 00:23:32,799
is the chance to change the world.

358
00:23:33,440 --> 00:23:34,528

00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:09,559
Why am I telling you all these?

539
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:23,400
Actually, we can't really blame Shen Chuan.

540
00:34:26,559 --> 00:34:27,648
If we have to blame someone,

541
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:32,079
it should be the engineer.

542
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,919
The Racing Federation hearing is coming soon.

543
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:47,936
What should we do now?

544
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:50,660
Should I go to the Racing Federation

545
00:34:50,660 --> 00:34:51,744
and beg them?

546
00:34:55,000 --> 00:34:56,199
No, don't bother.

547
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,700
Since they have called for a hearing,

548
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,060
we are already out of options.

549
00:35:00,060 --> 00:35:01,119
What should we do now?

550
00:35:02,199 --> 00:35:03,460
The old man is not willing to help.

551
00:35:03,460 --> 00:35:04,840
Mofei is insisting on her stance.

552
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,119
And you're not willing to apologize.

553
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:09,376
Your three family members are like triathletes.

554
00:35:12,719 --> 00:35:14,199
<i>[Zhao Yingning]</i>
Why is she calling again?

555
00:35:16,608 --> 00:35:17,679
Hello?

556
00:35:17,679 --> 00:35:19,240
Do you want your racing license back?

557
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:20,320
Come and find me.

558
00:35:23,840 --> 00:35:24,960
Thank you, Miss Zhao.

559
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,119
I thought you were helping me with my license.

560
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:30,900
If you want your license,

561
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,599
you have to make Chen Mofei cooperate with you.

562
00:35:33,239 --> 00:35:36,339
But she's not willing to help me,

563
00:35:36,339 --> 00:35:39,180
let alone the racing matter.

564
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,800
For an efficient cooperation,

565
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,560
you need to understand
the other party's demands.

566
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,820
Only by grasping their needs,
can we effectively communicate.

567
00:35:44,820 --> 00:35:47,120
Enough about the needs, let's cut to the chase.

568
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,160
What's your point?

569
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,400
My point is…

570
00:35:52,079 --> 00:35:53,080
I told you before

571
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,580
that I have a goal to get married this year.

572
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,719
What do you say?

573
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,880
Fine, I won't tease you anymore.

574
00:36:01,892 --> 00:36:03,684
<i>[Weishi Investments]</i>

575
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:09,840
This document I have

576
00:36:10,480 --> 00:36:12,380
might be the core need

577
00:36:12,380 --> 00:36:13,960
that gives you confidence in front of Ruifeng.

578
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,000
My mission in coming back to China this time

579
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,440
is to evaluate Ruifeng's
worthiness of investment.

580
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,119
To evaluate Ruifeng?

581
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:27,960
Are there going to be problems?

582
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:30,660
Well, there might be a deficit in accounting

583
00:36:30,660 --> 00:36:33,000
and the risk of being bought at a low price.

584
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,660
Chen Mofei dismissed you back then,

585
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:38,240
and I'll get your revenge. Isn't it nice?

586
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:39,400
Wait,

587
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:41,960
but Ruifeng was established
by my parents' painstaking effort.

588
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,879
That's what Chen Mofei thinks as well,

589
00:36:43,879 --> 00:36:45,220
which is why she's now on pins and needles.

590
00:36:45,220 --> 00:36:46,480
She cannot afford any mistakes.

591
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:52,639
If my car is really found faulty,

592
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,840
wouldn't that be an assist for you?

593
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,340
Selling a hundred thousand cars

594
00:36:56,340 --> 00:36:58,139
with occasional problems in some of them

595
00:36:58,139 --> 00:36:59,480
is not what I care about.

596
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,099
What I care about is
whether she has the confidence

597
00:37:02,099 --> 00:37:03,320
to solve all the problems.

598
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,480
And you will be my test to her.

599
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:09,480
A wise man hides his talents
and waits for the right time.

600
00:37:10,239 --> 00:37:11,440
Timing is everything.

601
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,320
So,

602
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:19,000
when do you plan to take action?

603
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:26,048
Shen Xi.

604
00:37:27,719 --> 00:37:29,000
Where are you going?

605
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,620
I have some thoughts about Chen Mobai
and want to report to Miss Mofei.

606
00:37:31,620 --> 00:37:34,080
She has already said that she
would not get involved.

607
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,880
You should hurry up and do your job.

608
00:37:36,704 --> 00:37:39,400
A VIP guest is coming, so get the tea ready.

609
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:41,639
What are you waiting for?

610
00:38:14,760 --> 00:38:17,320
You are so meticulous. Are you brewing tea
or making medicine?

611
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:19,264
It's you again.

612
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,360
Like I said last time,

613
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:23,440
if you want to apply, the HR department
is on the sixth floor.

614
00:38:24,039 --> 00:38:25,859
I walked around and got a little thirsty.

615
00:38:25,859 --> 00:38:26,960
Can I get a cup of tea?

616
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:30,200
This tea is for the meeting,

617
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:32,239
If you need some, there is tea
in the lobby on the first floor.

618
00:38:33,320 --> 00:38:34,920
I want to drink your tea.

619
00:38:37,159 --> 00:38:41,079
Lady, actually, our company
isn't open for visitors.

620
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,400
Do you really think I am a visitor?

621
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,400
We are preparing for a meeting.

622
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:48,640
If there's nothing else,

623
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:49,760
I'll ask you to leave now.

624
00:38:52,639 --> 00:38:53,840
What if I don't want to go?

625
00:38:55,159 --> 00:38:56,599
Then I have to call for security.

626
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,944
Miss Zhao.

627
00:39:00,519 --> 00:39:02,760
Hello, I am Chen Mofei.

628
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,576
Miss Mofei.

629
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,800
I admire your company's management.

630
00:39:08,599 --> 00:39:10,140
I wanted to drink a cup of tea,

631
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:12,039
but I was almost kicked out by your employees.

632
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:16,000
She didn't know you were our VIP. Don't mind.

633
00:39:17,039 --> 00:39:19,840
Can I drink your brewed tea now?

634
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:22,752
No, you can't.

635
00:39:25,639 --> 00:39:26,920
It's not ready yet.

636
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:29,664
Miss Zhao.

637
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,960
So pleased to finally meet you in person.

638
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:35,960
I've heard so much about you.

639
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,480
Pretty, young, and promising.

640
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:42,159
I'm An Yunlong. I often meet with Cheng

641
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,639
from Weishi at forums.

642
00:39:45,360 --> 00:39:46,400
Hello, Miss Zhao.

643
00:39:47,559 --> 00:39:49,119
Sorry, I haven't heard of you.

644
00:39:51,639 --> 00:39:53,680
That's not important.

645
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,679
As long as we know who you are, Miss Zhao.

646
00:39:56,239 --> 00:39:57,980
Shall we go in and sit down?

647
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,419
Miss Zhao, please.

648
00:39:59,419 --> 00:40:00,544
Miss Zhao.

649
00:40:01,199 --> 00:40:02,336
this way, please.

650
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,500
Now, on behalf of our company,

651
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,140
we warmly welcome Miss Zhao

652
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,440
from the Weishi Group for our evaluation.

653
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:26,199
I'm sorry, Mr. An, I'm afraid you're mistaken.

654
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,199
I'm not here for any evaluation.

655
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,260
I'm here to announce

656
00:40:30,260 --> 00:40:33,679
that Weishi and RuiFeng have
terminated their collaboration.

657
00:41:02,599 --> 00:41:03,648
Long time no see.

658
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,320
Ruifeng.

659
00:41:07,320 --> 00:41:08,440
Hold on.

660
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:09,472
Let's pause here.

661
00:41:10,559 --> 00:41:11,584
Did he go there like that?

662
00:41:13,079 --> 00:41:14,300
Without his brohters,

663
00:41:14,300 --> 00:41:15,599
what are his chances of winning?

664
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:19,700
Would Mobai get beaten up

665
00:41:19,700 --> 00:41:21,400
since he went alone?

666
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,440
Should we go and support him?

667
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,440
Yes. I'll give them some proper acupuncture.

668
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:32,672
Alright, alright.

669
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:35,040
If he dared to go there alone,

670
00:41:35,040 --> 00:41:36,400
he must have some aces up his sleeve.

671
00:41:37,039 --> 00:41:38,760
If you go there, he might get hit for real.

672
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,864
Sit, sit down.

673
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:46,679
Now we can only hope that his cards

674
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,960
can deal with those wily people.

675
00:41:53,840 --> 00:41:54,912
Mr. Mobai.

676
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:57,344
Qiao Na.

677
00:42:00,719 --> 00:42:02,679
Mr. Mobai, Mr. Mobai.

678
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:04,760
There's an important meeting going on.
You can't go in.

679
00:42:04,760 --> 00:42:05,824
Jiangwei.

680
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:09,088
Mobai, why are you here?

681
00:42:10,239 --> 00:42:11,296
To attend the meeting.

682
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:21,920
Mr. Mobai, why are you here?

683
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:26,680
Because I heard some

684
00:42:26,680 --> 00:42:28,119
insightful words yesterday.

685
00:42:29,039 --> 00:42:30,159
A wise man hides his talents

686
00:42:31,000 --> 00:42:32,639
and waits for the right time.

687
00:42:36,440 --> 00:42:38,519
Haven't Miss Mofei always accused me
of not being dedicated to my work?

688
00:42:39,320 --> 00:42:41,079
Today, I'm specifically here
to learn about the business.

689
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:43,652
<i>[Maituo]</i>

690
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:49,320
This is an unexpected situation, Miss Zhao.
Please don't mind.

691
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:52,679
It seems that RuiFeng's security
also needs improvement.

692
00:42:53,239 --> 00:42:55,119
Any Tom, Dick, or Harry can just waltz in.

693
00:42:55,639 --> 00:42:57,320
But it's okay, I don't mind.

694
00:42:58,239 --> 00:42:59,280
Miss Zhao likes to joke.

695
00:43:00,519 --> 00:43:02,320
This is our evaluation material.
Please take a look.

696
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:04,480
I've been in this industry
for so many years now,

697
00:43:05,159 --> 00:43:06,208
and there's no point

698
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:08,839
to go through the motions and wast

699
00:43:08,839 --> 00:43:10,360
all our time with these reports.

700
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:12,416
Let's just cut to the chase.

701
00:43:13,079 --> 00:43:14,760
Maituo has been unable to be
launched on the market,

702
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:18,960
and R&D costs are snowballing,

703
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:20,320
which leads to financial reports

704
00:43:20,320 --> 00:43:24,096
that are uglier than your faces now.

705
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:29,960
Weishi's wait for Maituo will be worth it.

706
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:32,159
For an investor,

707
00:43:32,159 --> 00:43:33,599
waiting is the biggest gamble.

708
00:43:34,119 --> 00:43:36,800
But the question is,
what leverage do you have left?

709
00:43:37,719 --> 00:43:39,840
Ruifeng is our leverage.

710
00:43:40,639 --> 00:43:42,239
Technology adds weight to our leverage.

711
00:43:42,880 --> 00:43:45,560
Fa-ion battery technology
will replace lithium-ion,

712
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:47,480
and become the future of electric cars.

713
00:43:48,119 --> 00:43:49,480
But who can ensure

714
00:43:49,480 --> 00:43:51,880
that fa-ion batteries can
truly go into production?

715
00:43:52,599 --> 00:43:54,359
Or when can they go into production?

716
00:43:54,359 --> 00:43:56,119
Miss Mofei, can you give me a straight answer?

717
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,528
Besides, the brand.

718
00:43:59,239 --> 00:44:00,359
Maituo's difficult birth

719
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:03,159
has led to a cliff-like decline
in the brand value of Ruifeng.

720
00:44:03,800 --> 00:44:06,159
Does anyone here have a good solution

721
00:44:06,159 --> 00:44:08,280
to prevent this situation from escalating?

722
00:44:09,079 --> 00:44:12,040
Miss Zhao, how about we increase advertising?

723
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:13,340
I have several proposals here.

724
00:44:13,340 --> 00:44:15,180
Mr. An, I don't know if you've ever heard

725
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:16,919
of the negative spiral theory.

726
00:44:16,919 --> 00:44:18,400
When the reputation is bad,

727
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,199
investing more on advertising

728
00:44:20,199 --> 00:44:22,159
will only backfire and make you sink faster.

729
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:26,260
Alright, if none of you have any better ideas,

730
00:44:26,260 --> 00:44:27,900
let's not waste everyone's time.

731
00:44:27,900 --> 00:44:29,119
We could do car racing.

732
00:44:36,679 --> 00:44:38,280
No one invited you to the meeting,

733
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,079
and you don't have the right to speak.

734
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:42,912
Sit down, please.

735
00:44:47,039 --> 00:44:48,820
If the Ruifeng Race Team is to be rebuilt,

736
00:44:48,820 --> 00:44:51,740
there might be a chance
for us to discuss this matter.

737
00:44:51,740 --> 00:44:53,559
Not just the team, him too.

738
00:44:56,719 --> 00:44:58,760
There was a problem with your Ruifeng's car.

739
00:45:00,159 --> 00:45:03,060
I, Chen Mobai, would not speed off the track

740
00:45:03,060 --> 00:45:05,159
even if I surpass thousands of cars on it.

741
00:45:08,079 --> 00:45:09,216
Does anyone believe him?

742
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:11,079
If you do, speak up.

743
00:45:17,559 --> 00:45:19,679
Look, nobody believes you.

744
00:45:20,920 --> 00:45:22,016
I do.

745
00:45:29,956 --> 00:45:34,436
<i>♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫</i>

746
00:45:36,260 --> 00:45:41,024
<i>♫ The heart gradually silences ♫</i>

747
00:45:42,404 --> 00:45:48,992
<i>♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫</i>

748
00:45:48,992 --> 00:45:54,464
<i>♫ I can't delete them ♫</i>

749
00:45:55,140 --> 00:46:01,024
<i>♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫</i>

750
00:46:01,024 --> 00:46:07,968
<i>♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫</i>

751
00:46:07,968 --> 00:46:16,480
<i>♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫</i>

752
00:46:17,284 --> 00:46:21,120
<i>♫ Fading away ♫</i>

753
00:46:22,308 --> 00:46:28,832
<i>♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫</i>

754
00:46:28,832 --> 00:46:35,616
<i>♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫</i>

755
00:46:36,708 --> 00:46:43,680
<i>♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫</i>

756
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:48,160
<i>♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫</i>

757
00:46:48,160 --> 00:46:54,400
<i>♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫</i>

758
00:46:54,400 --> 00:47:01,280
<i>♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫</i>

759
00:47:01,888 --> 00:47:08,416
<i>♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫</i>

760
00:47:08,416 --> 00:47:17,856
<i>♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫</i>
