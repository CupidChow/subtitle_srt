16
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:53,239
Welcome to Markus's special training camp.

17
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:56,040
I am the chief examiner, Shen Xi.

18
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,640
All of you are

19
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,400
outstanding racers in this season's Formula A.

20
00:02:01,239 --> 00:02:02,272
In the following days,

21
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:04,980
we will have more stringent requirements

22
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:06,700
on your physical fitness and driving skills.

23
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:08,000
I hope you can try your best.

24
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,240
Excuse me, no entry is allowed here.

25
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,319
We don't allow entry here.

26

No entry is allowed here.

27
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,319

Please cooperate with us, sir.

If I don't come,

32
00:02:22,496 --> 00:02:23,640
how can you get the best driver?

33
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:24,679
Sir, you--

34
00:02:24,679 --> 00:02:25,900
Please cooperate with us.

35
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:26,944
Yes, sir.

Don't stop me.

00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,599
Sir, you can't go any further.

38
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:30,624
I'm here to check myself in.

39
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,360
I'm sorry.

40
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,260
We have already told him
that this is a closed camp.

No unauthorized personnel are allowed.

They've said it.

43
00:02:43,879 --> 00:02:45,640
It's clearly written in the notice.

44
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:47,440
If you don't come by twelve,
it's considered giving up.

50
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,640
Since everyone is here,

51
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:03,759
let's officially start the camp.

52
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,800
Okay.

53
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,080
Brother, welcome to join.

54
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,360
Everyone, go back to the dormitory to rest.

The official training will start tomorrow.

After the end of the training,

57
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,840
the driver with the highest scores

58
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,400
can enter the Super Grand Prix

59
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:22,496
and test drive Wings of Wind.

[The rule of life is not to regret oneself.]

62
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:39,072
What did you say?

63
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,680
I asked you to persuade Mobai
to take care of his health.

64
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,000
But you persuaded him
to take the earliest flight

65
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,024
to Shanghai.

66
00:03:49,719 --> 00:03:50,752
You're welcome.

67
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:54,520
Except for the 'earliest flight',

68
00:03:54,520 --> 00:03:56,360
isn't sending him to Shanghai your intention?

69
00:03:58,319 --> 00:03:59,759
Yes, you're right.

70
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,599
But how did you manage to do it?

71
00:04:03,479 --> 00:04:04,960
He's been down for so long.

72
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,699
Just with a snap of my fingers,

73
00:04:13,699 --> 00:04:15,360
I got it done easily.

74
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:19,360
Childish.

75
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:25,479
But now that he's gone,

76
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:27,199
we don't know when he'll come back.

77
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:29,259
If he wins first place afterwards,

78
00:04:29,259 --> 00:04:30,639
will he go directly to Germany?

79
00:04:31,639 --> 00:04:32,959
What? You can't bear it?

80
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,680
Well,

81
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,519
you are kind of right about that.

82
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,759
Wait. You really can't bear it?

83
00:04:44,480 --> 00:04:46,519
Are you still not over him?

84
00:04:47,279 --> 00:04:50,300
You should know that a key part
of my performance after returning to China

85
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:52,480
is to marry Chen Mobai.

86
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:56,639
Now that he's gone,
how am I supposed to do that?

87
00:04:58,079 --> 00:04:59,360
What a pity.

88
00:05:00,959 --> 00:05:02,048
Well,

89
00:05:03,519 --> 00:05:05,000
thank you for the matter of Mobai.

90
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:07,959
It's late. I'd better go.

91
00:05:08,672 --> 00:05:09,728
Wait a moment.

92
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:19,940
I want to go eat noodles this afternoon.

93
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:21,839
I heard there's a good noodle shop in Linhai.

94
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:24,759
We can always go for noodles.
Let's do it another time.

95
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:25,959
Then we can watch a movie.

96
00:05:29,312 --> 00:05:30,339
Watch a movie?

97
00:05:30,339 --> 00:05:32,299
Why don't you wait for Mobai
to come back and watch it?

98
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:33,460
Doing something as ambiguous as this

99
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,480
is not suitable for us.

100
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,279
Today is Tuesday.

101
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,519
You can get a discount
if you buy a package for the late-night movie.

102
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:57,360
I am not the kind of person
who sits on the fence.

103
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:00,096
What do you mean?

104
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:02,680
I told Chen Mobai yesterday

105
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:06,319
that I don't want him anymore.

106
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:08,800
And then?

107
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:12,699
Then, of course, whoever goes
to see the late-night movie with me

108
00:06:12,699 --> 00:06:14,199
is my new target.

109
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,280
You mean me?

110
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,199
Here's a small suggestion.

111
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,420
The end of the year is a few months away.

112
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:23,319
I haven't completed my 'performance' either.

113
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:24,959
If you have time,

114
00:06:25,568 --> 00:06:26,624
we could give it a try.

115
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,040
I don't have time for the rest of this year.

116
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:35,319
If it's just giving it a try,
let's forget about it.

117
00:06:47,879 --> 00:06:49,959
Since you are not in a good mood,

118
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,140
I will still come to pick you up
for the late-night movie.

119
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,176
Also,

120
00:06:54,752 --> 00:06:55,959
before I come to pick you up,

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,360
never remove me from your target list.

122
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:42,000
How have you been recently?

123
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,776
How have you been?

124
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,279
It's late at night. What do you need?

125
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,120
I-I came to thank you.

126
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:00,560
Thank you

127
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,680
for helping me modify the data.

128
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,000
It was me who quit halfway.

129
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:12,040
I just finished what I was supposed to do.

130
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:16,680
If there's nothing else, I'll go to bed now.

131
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,080
You helped me just because of that?

132
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,160
You helped me after you returned to Markus,

133
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:35,080
just because you wanted to finish
what you started?

134
00:08:43,159 --> 00:08:44,192
No.

135
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,720
It's because I cared about you.

136
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:51,720
I thought it was because you cared about me.

137
00:09:01,679 --> 00:09:02,720
Chen Mobai,

138
00:09:03,919 --> 00:09:05,960
I hope you came this time
because of your dreams.

139
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,559
I will treat all trainees equally.

140
00:09:10,759 --> 00:09:12,620
Therefore,
you have to make a hundred percent effort.

141
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,856
How about apart from the training?

142
00:09:17,056 --> 00:09:18,159
Do you think we can stand here

143
00:09:18,159 --> 00:09:20,000
and act as if nothing happened?

144
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,759
The training begins tomorrow.

145
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:25,080
Go back and rest early.

146
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,559
If it's uncertain

147
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:05,159
whether we'll move forward
together in the future,

148
00:10:06,336 --> 00:10:07,488
at least

149
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:10,759
I don't hope to impede your advancement.

150
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:02,080
Thanks for today.

151
00:11:10,016 --> 00:11:11,104
You are welcome.

152
00:11:11,679 --> 00:11:12,800
It was all your decision.

153
00:11:14,080 --> 00:11:15,296
Aren't you afraid that I came this time

154
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,440
to take Shen Xi away?

155
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:23,960
Did you come here to take her away?

156
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:30,679
I don't want her to be disappointed.

157
00:11:32,559 --> 00:11:34,279
If you came for this reason,

158
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,519
she would really be disappointed.

159
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:43,020
This is a place
where miracles can happen in racing.

160
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:44,279
I hope you can put aside all your thoughts

161
00:11:45,919 --> 00:11:46,944
and fight for yourself.

162
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:50,559
You are an opponent worthy of respect.

163
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,016
But this time,

164
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:57,879
I will also impress everyone.

165
00:12:03,136 --> 00:12:04,192
I'm looking forward to it.

166
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:24,840
The Super Grand Prix

167
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,960
requires extraordinarily high physical fitness
from the racers.

168
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:29,180
The design of the Wings of Wind

169
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:31,279
emphasizes chasing and attacking in turns,

170
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:34,279
which means the driver's physical burden
will be greater.

171
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:36,399
Next,

172
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,080
led by Lin Shaoqian,

173
00:12:38,080 --> 00:12:40,928
everyone will undergo
a week of high-intensity physical training.

174
00:12:41,919 --> 00:12:43,399
I know that you are all excellent drivers.

175
00:12:44,416 --> 00:12:45,472
But,

176
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,519
according to the standards of the Grand Prix,

177
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,759
none of you are qualified yet.

178
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,679
What we want is not just excellence

179
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:53,840
but

180
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:54,848
world-leading.

181
00:12:54,848 --> 00:12:56,080
Yes!

182
00:12:56,759 --> 00:12:58,640
Everyone should
complete the physical tasks accordingly.

183
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,040
We will grade.

Each task comes with a bonus weight.

185

You'll get bonus points for being outstanding.

186

Let's get started.

187
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:07,840
Chen Mobai,

188
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:10,880
wasn't Shen Xi previously a member of Ruifeng?

189
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:12,599
Are you sure
you won't receive preferential treatment?

190
00:13:12,599 --> 00:13:14,159
Didn't Lin Shaoqian train you too?

191
00:13:15,759 --> 00:13:16,992
I want to emphasize

192
00:13:16,992 --> 00:13:19,620
that here we are only instructors and trainees.

193
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:20,679
Lu Yunhao, step forward.

194
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:23,540
50 push-ups.

195
00:13:23,540 --> 00:13:24,576

196
00:13:27,008 --> 00:13:28,096
Chen Mobai.

197
00:13:28,096 --> 00:13:29,152
Yes.

198
00:13:29,152 --> 00:13:30,208
Step forward.

199
00:13:31,720 --> 00:13:32,864
You also do 50 push-ups.

200
00:13:32,864 --> 00:13:33,952
Yes.

201
00:13:37,639 --> 00:13:38,799
I thank you for dragging me down.

202
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,380
Don't worry, bro.

203
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,099
If there is such luck in the future,

204
00:13:42,099 --> 00:13:43,519
I will definitely share it with you.

205
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,480
Everyone, warm up for ten minutes.

206
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,240

Yes.

208
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:15,120
The Super Grand Prix is one of the sports

209
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,720
with the highest demands

210
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,440
on an athlete's cardiac load in the world.

211
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,940
And it also has extremely high demands
on the neck muscles.

212
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,840
You not only need aerobic exercise

213
00:14:22,840 --> 00:14:24,560
but also have to train your necks,

214
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,480
which will withstand
a centrifugal force of 4 to 6 Gs.

215
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,700
At the same time,

216
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,820
to exert strong braking power,

217
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,600
the driver's left foot must be able to apply

218
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,639
around 159 kilograms of force.

219
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:36,759

are also the focus of training.

you would treat me the same

to protect their bodies during training.

00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,400
we've been working overtime recently

289
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,640
to fulfill orders.

290
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,839
A worker under me was overly exhausted

291
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:24,059
and violated the assembly procedure,

292
00:21:24,059 --> 00:21:26,559
causing a severe overcharge of a battery pack.

293
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,500
Also, he failed to install
the battery management system

294

295
00:21:30,624 --> 00:21:31,904
So it caught fire.

However, it's not a problem
with the quality of the battery.

297

00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,880
the presidency of Chen Mofei

368
00:25:42,799 --> 00:25:45,079
and let An Yunlong take over

369
00:25:45,759 --> 00:25:46,816
as the acting president

370
00:25:47,799 --> 00:25:48,920
until she resolves

371
00:25:49,920 --> 00:25:51,079
the predicament of Maituo.

372
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,200
Chairman, perhaps…

373
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,799
Due to my old age,

374
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:06,720
I should not be more involved
in company decisions.

375
00:26:08,160 --> 00:26:09,319
But this time, Chen Mofei has indeed

376
00:26:09,839 --> 00:26:11,920
caused huge losses to the company.

377
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,664
We can't go easy on her.

378
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,799
She must resolve this matter

379
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:17,780
at maximum speed

380
00:26:17,780 --> 00:26:19,480
and give everyone a satisfactory explanation.

381
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:22,759
Does anyone have any objections?

382
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:26,799
There's a great line of poetry that says,

383
00:26:27,359 --> 00:26:29,599
"Too much sighing can break one's will,

384
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:32,200
and all things should be viewed
with a broadened horizon."

385
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:34,559
New energy vehicles

386
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,200
are still the focal point of competition
in the global automotive industry.

387
00:26:38,816 --> 00:26:39,936
As a national car company,

388
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:41,759
we, Ruifeng,

389
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:43,880
must

390
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,839
do our utmost to do a good job in this matter.

391
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:47,800
This is our mission

392
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:49,200
as well as our duty.

393
00:26:50,119 --> 00:26:52,319
If we shrink back and dare not move forward

394
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,039
because of a small setback,

395
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,359
that's shortsightedness.

396
00:26:59,039 --> 00:27:00,260
That's also against

397
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:02,839
the historical development of Ruifeng.

398
00:27:03,720 --> 00:27:05,400
Okay, both of you sit down.

399
00:27:07,232 --> 00:27:08,352
Thanks, Chairman.

400
00:27:10,816 --> 00:27:12,000
Yunlong,

401
00:27:13,119 --> 00:27:14,759
thank you for your tolerance

402
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,119
as the acting president.

403
00:27:17,839 --> 00:27:20,279
There was never a line dispute in Ruifeng.

404
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:22,400
Fuel vehicles and electric vehicles

405
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:24,160
are all Ruifeng's children.

406
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,184
Yes.

407
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:27,220
They should all grow and thrive.

408
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,480
Yes.

409
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,599
Chairman, you're right.

410
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,960
We all have one heart

411
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:36,040
for the sake
of the better development of Ruifeng.

412
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:37,079
Only the united force

413
00:27:37,599 --> 00:27:39,480
of the company will bring more improvement.

414
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:42,759
I will certainly cooperate with Miss Mofei.

415
00:27:43,759 --> 00:27:44,928
Chairman, rest assured.

416
00:27:46,528 --> 00:27:47,616
That's good.

417
00:27:51,519 --> 00:27:53,632
Okay, you guys stay.

418
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:54,784
Go back.

419
00:27:55,839 --> 00:27:56,928
- Take care, chairman.
- Okay.

420
00:28:00,119 --> 00:28:01,519
Father, thank you.

421
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,720
I'm getting old.

422
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:05,039
There's not much I can do to help you.

423
00:28:06,200 --> 00:28:08,519
This time, I chose to step in to help you out.

424
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:10,119
I hope I made the right choice.

425
00:28:11,359 --> 00:28:13,680
This will not happen again in the future.

426
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,280
I will definitely find the best solution

427
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,400
to get Ruifeng out of trouble.

428
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:23,240
With your words, I feel at ease.

429
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:36,480
You came back from Jiangmen so quickly.

430
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:38,240
How did it go?

431
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:40,599
Don't worry.

432
00:28:40,599 --> 00:28:42,640
Thank you for persuading my father
to come here.

433
00:28:43,599 --> 00:28:45,240
Otherwise,
I really don't know how to survive this.

434
00:28:46,920 --> 00:28:49,088
It was his own decision to come.

435
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:50,688
I'm just a driver.

436
00:28:51,424 --> 00:28:52,576
Thank you.

437
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:54,939
You should take a good rest.

438
00:28:54,939 --> 00:28:56,480
After I drop the chairman off,

439
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:57,568
I'll come back to pick you up.

440
00:29:08,279 --> 00:29:10,079
Now I will take you through the training.

441
00:29:10,960 --> 00:29:12,960
Everyone, choose a car
and drive it to the finish line.

442
00:29:14,464 --> 00:29:15,584
I have a question.

443
00:29:16,544 --> 00:29:17,664
Is that all?

444
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,344
Are there no other rules?

445
00:29:21,344 --> 00:29:22,368
No.

446
00:29:23,079 --> 00:29:24,519
There's a repair station
in the middle of the track.

447
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,659
There are tools in it.

448
00:29:25,659 --> 00:29:27,759
If needed,
you can stop by to get what you need.

449
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:29,759
See you at the finish line.

450
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:31,584
Get ready, everyone.

451
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:37,100
Lu, this training is not that simple.

452
00:29:37,100 --> 00:29:38,359
If you want to win the game,

453
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,032
just listen to my arrangement.

454
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:44,359
Chen Mobai, join our team.

455
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,200
Then we will be the strongest.

456
00:29:47,119 --> 00:29:48,600
Yes, Mr. Mobai.

457
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,140
Why don't you join us?

458
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:51,580
Anyway, we are so familiar.

459
00:29:51,580 --> 00:29:52,832
It's convenient for us to cooperate.

460
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:57,079
I've been a driver for so many years,
and I never 'cooperate'.

461
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,240
The game is about individual strength.

462
00:29:59,960 --> 00:30:01,200
Isn't it cheating to cooperate?

463
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:10,279
Chen Mobai, where is your steering wheel?

464
00:31:20,680 --> 00:31:21,792
What?

465
00:31:32,839 --> 00:31:34,880
Can I just have a steering knuckle?

466
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:35,919
Steering knuckle.

467
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:37,480
I'm sorry, guys.

468
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,780
We only provide the most basic repair tools.

469
00:31:39,780 --> 00:31:41,699
And we're sure
there's nothing wrong with the rule.

470
00:31:41,699 --> 00:31:43,340
The rest is up to you.

471
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,620
Wait. Are you joking? How can I repair it?

472
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,720
If worst comes to worst,
we'll push the car to the finish line.

473
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:49,979
I'm sorry. It's against the rule.

474
00:31:49,979 --> 00:31:51,480
You must drive to the finish line.

475
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:54,496
Lu,

476
00:31:55,079 --> 00:31:56,120
my tyre is flat.

477
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,319
Inflate it for me first.

478
00:31:58,920 --> 00:32:00,340
I need to fix mine.

479
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,400
We are a team.

480
00:32:02,079 --> 00:32:03,100
Inflate mine first.

481
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,560
I'll find time to help you later.

482
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,360
When did I agree to be on your team?

483
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:08,359
What did Mr. Yijun say before we came?

484
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,079
You should cooperate with me unconditionally.

485
00:32:17,568 --> 00:32:18,599
I'll inflate yours first.

486
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:20,260
Later, you can help me look for

487
00:32:20,260 --> 00:32:21,559
something that can patch the tyre.

488
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,300
Do it by yourself.

489
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:24,359
I'm in a rush.

490
00:32:26,160 --> 00:32:27,232
Why did you stop?

491
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:32,680
I originally thought

492
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:35,279
you might just be annoying.

493
00:32:36,519 --> 00:32:39,100
I didn't expect you not to have
even the most basic contract spirit.

494
00:32:39,100 --> 00:32:40,320
Do it yourself.

495
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,120
You!

496
00:32:45,120 --> 00:32:46,180
Didn't you come here

497
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:47,599
to cooperate with me?

498
00:32:48,599 --> 00:32:50,920
Listen. Although I'm not a good person,

499
00:32:50,920 --> 00:32:51,920
I have my bottom line.

500
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,119
I don't care what agreement
you have reached with the company,

501
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,200
but you've ruined the spirit of racing.

502
00:32:57,184 --> 00:32:58,304
Asshole.

503
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:01,559
I'll expose you to Mr. Yijun when I go back.

504
00:33:02,759 --> 00:33:05,319
I don't care.

505
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,264
Get out of my way.

506
00:33:22,048 --> 00:33:23,080
I'm sorry.

507
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,480
We only provide the most basic repair tools.

508
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:27,720
And we're sure
there's nothing wrong with the rule.

509
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,039
The rest is up to you.

510
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:03,616
Don't panic.

511
00:34:03,616 --> 00:34:04,720
Sometimes,

512
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:05,920
the most complicated issues

513
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,400
can be solved in the simplest ways.

514
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:18,464
What's this? A demonstration?

515
00:35:34,400 --> 00:35:35,920
Didn't you say you want to do it on your own,

516
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:36,960
and cooperating is cheating?

517
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,880
I just think it's very dangerous.

518
00:35:42,848 --> 00:35:43,936
Give me a hand.

519
00:35:44,512 --> 00:35:45,632
Stop it. I'll do it myself.

520
00:35:46,559 --> 00:35:47,744
Get out of here quickly.

521
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:50,320
You must win first place.
You can't let Mitsui Taku win.

522
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:56,960
Go, go, go!

523
00:36:02,679 --> 00:36:04,119
One of us has to win, right?

524
00:36:41,632 --> 00:36:42,752
As a driver,

525
00:36:44,079 --> 00:36:45,920
when controlling a car full of new technologies

526
00:36:46,760 --> 00:36:48,159
on an ever-changing track,

527
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,320
there will surely be
a lot of unfavorable conditions.

528
00:36:52,768 --> 00:36:53,856
Whether they give up

529
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:55,800
and whether they find a solution

530
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,159
will determine how far their car can go

531
00:37:00,288 --> 00:37:01,344
and also

532
00:37:01,960 --> 00:37:04,360
how far they can go
in their professional career.

533
00:37:06,480 --> 00:37:07,599
More important is professional ethics.

534
00:37:09,664 --> 00:37:10,720
Forming gangs

535
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,448
and scheming against opponents

536
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,528
both violate professional ethics.

537
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,000
That's all for today's training.

538
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:19,980
I will calculate the final scores

539
00:37:19,980 --> 00:37:21,119
based on your ratings these days.

540
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:27,160
Let Lin Yongjian contact these media.

541
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,419
Tell them that
only a small percent of orders are canceled,

542
00:37:29,419 --> 00:37:31,660
and it has nothing to do
with the fire a couple of days ago.

543
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:32,704
Okay.

544
00:37:38,432 --> 00:37:39,459
Where is Chen Mofei?

545
00:37:39,459 --> 00:37:42,360
Miss Mofei said she has already
been contacting potential clients.

546
00:37:45,024 --> 00:37:46,144
Okay, Mr. Liu.

547
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,119
If there are further needs later, let me know.

548
00:37:51,520 --> 00:37:52,640
Bye.

549
00:37:56,599 --> 00:37:57,840
So that's how you handle canceled orders?

550
00:38:05,376 --> 00:38:06,432
Hello?

551
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:08,096
Mr. Huang.

552
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,239
The discount we mentioned is fine.

553
00:38:11,599 --> 00:38:13,519
Ghis has an order demand?

554
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,239
This is really great assistance during my need.

555
00:38:16,992 --> 00:38:18,080
No problem.

556
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:21,039
Okay, I'll be right there.

557
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:24,992
I'll warm up the car first.

558
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,808
I will certainly

559
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:30,800
find a new sales channel for Maituo.

560
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,880
Thank you all for your efforts
during this period.

561
00:38:40,159 --> 00:38:42,559
I hope you have gained a better understanding
of the meaning of racing.

562
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:44,900
Before announcing the results,

563
00:38:44,900 --> 00:38:46,000
I want to tell you

564
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:48,260
that during this period, you have proven

565
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,039
that you're a very good driver.

566
00:38:51,159 --> 00:38:52,256
Whether you are chosen or not,

567
00:38:52,840 --> 00:38:54,920
you deserve to walk out of here
with your head held high.

568
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,519
Now I'll announce the results.

569
00:38:58,519 --> 00:39:00,639
Mitsui Taku, 82 points.

570
00:39:02,272 --> 00:39:03,392
Lu Yunhao,

571
00:39:04,599 --> 00:39:05,696
77 points.

572
00:39:06,464 --> 00:39:07,660
I only got this much?

573
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:09,159
Luo Jiacheng, 70 points.

574
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,239
Chami, 68 points.

575
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,320
Han Zhiyu, 81 points.

576
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,168
Chen Mobai,

577
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,016
80 points.

578
00:39:18,016 --> 00:39:19,059
That can't be right.

579
00:39:19,059 --> 00:39:21,839
How could Han Zhiyu's score
be higher than Chen Mobai's?

580
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:22,848
Do you have a problem?

581
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,720
The scores are computer-generated
based on your past performances

582
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:29,239
and your performance

583
00:39:29,239 --> 00:39:30,304
in this training session.

584
00:39:30,304 --> 00:39:31,392
But

585
00:39:32,000 --> 00:39:33,280
racing isn't just about speed.

586
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,159
As I mentioned during the training,

587
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:36,960
a true good driver

588
00:39:37,519 --> 00:39:38,560
is reflected in many areas.

589
00:39:39,679 --> 00:39:40,880
Since the beginning of the training,

590
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,800
we have seen all your strengths and weaknesses.

591
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:44,079
Next up, let's announce the bonus points.

592
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:45,760
Mitsui Taku,

593
00:39:46,400 --> 00:39:47,679
two points.

594
00:39:47,679 --> 00:39:50,600
You can always analyze complicated situations
during training

595
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:52,250
and make the most effective plans

596
00:39:52,250 --> 00:39:54,439
in the shortest time.

597
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:55,559
You have great judgment.

598
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,400
Lu Yunhao, four points.

599
00:39:59,039 --> 00:40:00,800
You are a driver with great explosive power.

600
00:40:01,559 --> 00:40:04,039
No matter what the situation,
you always persist to the end,

601
00:40:04,679 --> 00:40:05,960
even if you're behind.

602
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:07,000
You're extremely resilient.

603
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,960
Chen Mobai, five points.

604
00:40:11,880 --> 00:40:13,760
Why does Chen Mobai get so many bonus points?

605
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:14,784
With such a bonus,

606
00:40:14,784 --> 00:40:16,679
doesn't he score higher than all of us?

607
00:40:22,519 --> 00:40:23,584
I don't accept it.

608
00:40:24,119 --> 00:40:25,319
Where is he better than me?

609
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:27,360
Yeah, he doesn't have more tricks than you.

610
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:28,960
Be quiet.

611
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:32,519
In this go-kart training,

612
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,880
Chen Mobai has shown great creativity.

613
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:38,399
And we found
that he actually trained while injured.

614
00:40:38,399 --> 00:40:39,599
The immediate measurements

615
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,580
show the pressure on his legs and neck

616
00:40:41,580 --> 00:40:43,480
is 15% higher than that of the average driver.

617
00:40:44,079 --> 00:40:45,679
His condition is worse,
but his performance is better.

618
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:49,000
This shows that he has very good endurance.

619
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:50,039
That's not fair.

620
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,480
Why can he get bonus points for being injured?

621
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,632
Yeah.

622
00:40:53,632 --> 00:40:54,816
For a racing driver,

623
00:40:54,816 --> 00:40:56,119
being injured

624
00:40:57,039 --> 00:40:58,112
is equivalent to failure.

625
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,960
Failure is precious.

626
00:41:00,639 --> 00:41:02,119
Turning failure into victory

627
00:41:03,424 --> 00:41:04,544
is even more precious.

628
00:41:05,888 --> 00:41:07,040
Isn't he talking about you?

629
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:08,760
You took a break for three stops
due to a neck injury.

630
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:10,944
Shut up.

631
00:41:11,559 --> 00:41:12,719
Racing is a team sport.

632
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:14,920
The track is not a one-man battlefield.

633
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,960
If any of you have objections,
bring them up for discussion.

634
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:22,360
I believe that, not only in this training,

635
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:25,280
Chen Mobai is also the strongest,

636
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,960
most stubborn, and fairest opponent
I have ever seen on the track.

637
00:41:28,559 --> 00:41:29,632
I admire him.

638
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,320
I'm okay with his bonus points.

639
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,079
Since we were young,

640
00:41:34,079 --> 00:41:35,800
I've competed with him,
winning and losing in turns.

641
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,100
I always hope to surpass him.

642
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:39,119
Today, I found out

643
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,679
that I'm actually quite happy that he won.

644
00:41:42,360 --> 00:41:43,520
So I'm okay with his bonus points.

645
00:41:45,120 --> 00:41:46,199
- I'm okay with that too.
- Me too.

646
00:41:46,199 --> 00:41:47,559
Me too.

647
00:41:52,199 --> 00:41:54,239
I'll now announce the final result.

648
00:41:54,760 --> 00:41:56,079
We have selected two drivers:

649
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,800
Chen Mobai and Mitsui Taku.

650
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,800
Both of you will enter the final training

651
00:42:02,360 --> 00:42:03,584
and test drive the Wings of Wind.

652
00:42:04,239 --> 00:42:05,519
The final winner will be chosen then.

653
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:31,840
Your shoulder has recovered.

654
00:42:32,719 --> 00:42:33,740
You don't need to come anymore.

655
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:34,920
I am not here to apply medicine.

656
00:42:44,719 --> 00:42:45,760
This is for you.

657
00:42:48,719 --> 00:42:50,840
This work photo should be in Ruifeng.

658
00:42:51,679 --> 00:42:52,700
You shouldn't give it to me.

659
00:42:52,700 --> 00:42:53,760
I shouldn't.

660
00:42:57,088 --> 00:42:58,176
But I want to give it to you.

661
00:43:07,827 --> 00:43:12,307
♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫

662
00:43:14,227 --> 00:43:18,831
♫ The heart gradually silences ♫

663
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:26,799
♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫

664
00:43:26,799 --> 00:43:31,887
♫ I can't delete them ♫

665
00:43:32,947 --> 00:43:38,959
♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫

666
00:43:38,959 --> 00:43:45,839
♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫

667
00:43:45,839 --> 00:43:54,287
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

668
00:43:55,123 --> 00:43:59,119
♫ Fading away ♫

669
00:44:00,275 --> 00:44:06,767
♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫

670
00:44:06,767 --> 00:44:13,135
♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫

671
00:44:14,611 --> 00:44:21,487
♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫

672
00:44:21,487 --> 00:44:25,839
♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫

673
00:44:25,839 --> 00:44:32,207
♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫

674
00:44:32,207 --> 00:44:38,959
♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫

675
00:44:38,959 --> 00:44:46,287
♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫

676
00:44:46,287 --> 00:44:55,887
♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫
