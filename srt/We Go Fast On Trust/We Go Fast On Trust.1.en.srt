18
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:48,940

Today, we are going
to livestream the penultimate round

23
00:01:57,919 --> 00:02:00,600
of this season's China Formula B Championship.

Formula B is the rally point for heroes,

25

while Formula A is the arena for them.

26
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:08,060

Luo Jiacheng, Lu Yunhao, and Chen Mobai

28
00:02:09,619 --> 00:02:12,120
are all close to the threshold
of moving up to Formula A.

Among these competitors,

33
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:23,739
Lu Yunhao would certainly be the strongest
when it comes to team strength.

34
00:02:23,739 --> 00:02:25,719
After all, he is backed by Junda,

35

a leading automaker.

36
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,140
However, if we take a look
at the current driver point standings,

37
00:02:30,140 --> 00:02:33,520
we'll find that it's not Lu Yunhao
who is in the top spot,

38
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,299
but Chen Mobai.

39
00:02:35,299 --> 00:02:37,400
Although he was forced
to leave Ruifeng two years ago,

40
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,480
and he has been competing
as an independent driver

41

that racing is not just about having funds.

45
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:49,940
The competition is fierce,
with many strong contenders.

46

with Chen Mobai closely following.

At this point,
neither party can afford to slack off.

66
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:18,000
So Lu Yunhao is also giving it his all.

67
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
And the technical advantage
of Junda becomes evident

68
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:22,420
in such fiercely competitive moments.

69
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,600
Although theoretically speaking,

Chen Mobai still has an opportunity
at the bend ahead,

356
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:58,960
Take it easy.

357
00:18:59,680 --> 00:19:01,580
Now we have the registration
fee for the next race.

358
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,860
Chubby, prepare the tea. We're
going to fleece a guest.

359
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:06,160
I mean receive a guest.

360
00:19:08,119 --> 00:19:09,519
Go away, don't cause trouble for yourself.

361
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:35,960
Hao, no, I should call you Mr. Lu now.

362
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:38,519
Your visit honors us.

363
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:40,840
Xu Gong repairs cars, I do the modification,

364
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:42,600
and Mobai is the cashier now.

365
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,340
Did you bring enough money?

366
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:47,199
No, Monkey. I pick my cars to repair.

367
00:19:47,199 --> 00:19:49,120
After all, some of them are too nasty.

368
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,656
Xu Gong.

369
00:19:51,700 --> 00:19:53,799
Customers are always right.

370
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,520
We are all fellow apprentices.

371
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,120
Please don't mind our joke.

372
00:19:58,799 --> 00:20:00,359
We are not the same as Mr. Mobai.

373
00:20:01,079 --> 00:20:03,920
Even if you are fired by Ruifeng,
your surname is still Chen.

374
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,400
You will inherit the family business anyway.

375
00:20:08,119 --> 00:20:09,120
I'm not you.

376
00:20:10,079 --> 00:20:12,440
I can't afford to lose.

377
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:17,760
Mr. Lu, did you come today to talk?

378
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,580
I'm not that childish.

379
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,200
I'm here to modify the car.
Can you do a second-order?

380
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:24,448
Yes, we can.

381
00:20:25,344 --> 00:20:26,432
Eighty thousand.

382
00:20:26,960 --> 00:20:28,199
Why are you charging so much?

383
00:20:28,199 --> 00:20:29,759
Given our deep friendship.

384
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:32,279
You enjoy seeing me work for you.

385
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,640
Who else would dare do this?

386
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:38,519
Deal, but you must do it yourself

387
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,512
Alright.

388
00:20:41,319 --> 00:20:42,480
Since we're here anyway

389
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:43,820
Let's have a race.

390
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:47,000
Take it as a warm-up session for the endgame.

391
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:49,039
I will swipe my card instantly if you win.

392
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:50,848
Would you dare?

393
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:52,544
It's not that I don't dare,

394
00:20:53,799 --> 00:20:55,079
I just don't accept it.

395
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:57,120
Do you know why?

396
00:20:57,120 --> 00:20:58,176
Why?

397
00:20:58,176 --> 00:20:59,680
You have to pay extra for practice.

398
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,180
Twenty thousand.

399
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:07,296
Would twenty thousand be okay?

400
00:21:08,599 --> 00:21:10,799
What happens if you lose?

401
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,519
If I lose

402
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:16,680
I will modify the car for free.

403
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:17,856
Deal!

404
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,032
Hao Yang.

405
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:21,696
Billing.

406
00:21:23,319 --> 00:21:24,360
Here's the rules.

407
00:21:24,360 --> 00:21:25,860
Help the other person choose someone

408
00:21:25,860 --> 00:21:27,279
stand at the designated point over there.

409
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:28,896
We'll reverse towards that place.

410
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,760
Only start drifting when people throw confetti.

411
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,400
Finally, see whose car is closer to the person,

412
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:35,168
that person will be considered victorious.

413
00:21:35,936 --> 00:21:36,939
You pick first.

414
00:21:36,939 --> 00:21:38,200
You talk too much.

415
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,712
It's you then.

416
00:21:44,359 --> 00:21:45,440
It seems that you can't wait.

417
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:48,720
My turn now.

418
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:52,448
Her.

419
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,464
I'm sorry.

420
00:21:54,464 --> 00:21:56,060
If you guys are busy today,

421
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,400
I'll come back another day.

422
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,328
That girl.

423
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,039
No way. She's not one of us.

424
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,440
Miss, as you heard, we really don't have money.

425
00:22:05,119 --> 00:22:06,340
We'll discuss Ruifeng's matter later.

426
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,424
I said her.

427
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,184
Bai.

428
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,752
Mobai.

429
00:22:11,319 --> 00:22:13,360
Mr. Chen Mobai, this is nothing
to do with me, right?

430
00:22:13,360 --> 00:22:14,519
You're here for the money, aren't you?

431
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:16,960
Who can get money easily these days?

432
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:22,940
It's simple, just stand on that platform

433
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,400
and wait for them to finish throwing.

434
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:26,279
Then you throw this down.

435
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,160
You see

436
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:31,720
If I lose today because of you,

437
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:33,119
you will not get a penny.

438
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,319
It's not too difficult, you
just throw it after them.

439
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,119
I promise you that

440
00:22:38,119 --> 00:22:39,260
once it's over, I will give you the money.

441
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,320
No matter what happens

442
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:43,519
don't be afraid.

443
00:22:43,519 --> 00:22:44,704
Trust me.

444
00:22:50,359 --> 00:22:52,319
Can she really do this?

445
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:54,340
Mobai thinks she is capable.

446
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:56,480
We don't really have any choice.

447
00:22:57,079 --> 00:22:58,359
Let's trust him.

448
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,260
Throwing it too early will cause a loss,
and too late will result in a collision.

449
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:07,079
It's all about who can be more accurate.

450
00:23:07,599 --> 00:23:09,880
Lu Yunhao did this on purpose.

451
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,519
Go for it, Yunhao.

452
00:23:12,519 --> 00:23:15,279
Yunhao, come on.

453
00:23:15,279 --> 00:23:16,720
You can do it, Yunhao.

454
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:17,860
Yunhao!

455
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,199

00:23:19,199 --> 00:23:20,559
Come on, Mobai.

457
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:21,839
Come on, Mobai.

458
00:23:21,839 --> 00:23:23,119
Come on, Mobai.

459
00:23:23,119 --> 00:23:24,120

Come on, Yunhao!

462
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,759
You can do this.

463
00:23:47,319 --> 00:23:53,400
Beat him, Yunhao!

464
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:58,400
You got this.

465

Mobai.

466
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:02,440
You can do this.

467
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:35,119
The gear ratio of the car in reverse is 2.905.
