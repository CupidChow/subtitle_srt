<i>[Episode 3]</i>

15
00:01:39,456 --> 00:01:40,560
We can do racing.

16
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,159
A popular saying
in the foreign automobile industry is:

17
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:52,719
Win on the weekend, sell on Monday.

18
00:01:53,519 --> 00:01:55,480
It refers to the significance of racing
for automakers.

19
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:59,879
It's the best way to help automakers
build their brand image.

20
00:02:00,736 --> 00:02:01,760
Mr. Mobai,

21
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,296
in theory, you're not wrong.

22
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,088
But foreign theory

23
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:06,920
may not suit the domestic situation.

24
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,500
Foreign frontline car brands

25
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,439
all rely on racing to maintain

26
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,840
their brand's commercial value.

27
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,280
Whether it's Markus from Germany
or Takano from Japan,

28
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:19,680
performance on the race track
is tied with that year's sales…

29
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:20,800
Chen Mobai,

30
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:23,879
no one asked you to attend the meeting.

31
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,599
You don't have the right to speak.

32
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,416
Sit down, please.

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,360
Can he continue speaking?

34
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:37,920
Miss Mofei,

35
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:40,039
you probably don't know this yet.

36
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:44,000
Miss Zhao is a bona-fide racing enthusiast.

37
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:46,960
I believe Miss Zhao is also very interested

38
00:02:47,488 --> 00:02:48,576
in my suggestion.

39
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:50,176
Exactly.

40
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:52,599
Everyone present

41
00:02:52,599 --> 00:02:54,960
should understand the significance
of racing for a car company.

42
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:57,399
Hasn't your old competitor, Junda,

43
00:02:57,399 --> 00:03:00,320
significantly increased their brand value
in recent years

44
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,480
through their team's outstanding performance?

45
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:04,280
Now the media and consumers

46
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,719
tend to favor them more.

47
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,120
But Ruifeng cut off their team

48
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,719
two years ago.

49
00:03:12,439 --> 00:03:13,739
Miss Zhao,

50
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:15,119
can we interpret it this way?

51
00:03:15,119 --> 00:03:17,100
If we rebuild Ruifeng Race Team,

52
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,719
there is the possibility for us
to continue this discussion.

53
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:22,759
Besides the team, there's him.

54
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:27,860
Sure, it's good Mr. Mobai is there.

55
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,940
He's one of us.

56
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:30,160
But it's unfortunate

57
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:31,740
that Mr. Mobai's racing license was revoked

58
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:33,639
because of street racing.

59
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:35,439
Let me reiterate.

60
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:38,479
The problem was with your Ruifeng car.

61
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:42,479
Even if I, Chen Mobai, overtake a million times
on the race track,

62
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,520
I will never drag race off the track.

63
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:48,704
Does anyone believe him?

64
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,639
If anyone believes him, say it.

65
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,879
Look, no one believes you.

66
00:03:57,952 --> 00:03:58,976
I believe.

67
00:04:06,368 --> 00:04:07,488
Who are you?

68
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:09,840
What good does your belief do?

69
00:04:10,368 --> 00:04:11,392
Where's the evidence?

70
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,160
If we can treat the issue
of Chen Mobai speeding

71
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,280
as a mathematical problem…

72
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:19,296
Excuse me.

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,879
We're still in a meeting.

74
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:23,168
Please go do what you need to do.

75
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,832
Continue.

76
00:04:27,079 --> 00:04:29,040
Alright, let's hear it.

77
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,040
What do you have to say?

78
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:32,672
Go ahead.

79
00:04:33,184 --> 00:04:34,440
Miss Mofei, we…

80
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:35,552
Excuse me.

81
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,199
I need a whiteboard.

82
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,240
Firstly,

83
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,800
analyze the danger points
of the vehicle throughout the route.

84
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,200
Based on the vehicle's speed at the time

85
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,380
and the actual turning radius as constraints,

86
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,680
input the known data from the vehicle dynamics,

87
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:05,300
such as vehicle weight, wheelbase,

88
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:06,560
limit steering angle, etc.,

89
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,439
to infer unknown data,

90
00:05:08,959 --> 00:05:11,000
like tire friction coefficient,

91
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,360
axle load transfer coefficient, etc.,

92
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:14,040
to get the combination solution.

93
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,480
Calculate according to the constraint function
of the combination solution

94
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,840
to find out the probability of occurrence
of the unknown combination solution,

95
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,000
and you can find out

96
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,399
the final probability of the vehicle
passing through the whole process is

97
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:33,879
0.0012.

98
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,040
So according to your theory,

99
00:05:43,639 --> 00:05:44,759
if the car malfunctioned,

100
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:48,079
the probability of Mr. Mobai being okay
is one in a thousand.

101
00:05:49,439 --> 00:05:51,340
I'll put it in a way everyone can understand.

102
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:52,600
That is,

103
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,160
the probability of him
intentionally speeding is

104
00:05:54,759 --> 00:05:56,319
99.99%.

105
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:00,960
That's not what I mean.

106
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,040
What I'm trying to say is

107
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:03,780
as long as this probability is not zero,

108
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,120
it is possible.

109
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,759
So I would like to thank you
on behalf of the company.

110
00:06:07,519 --> 00:06:08,879
Because today, this matter

111
00:06:09,399 --> 00:06:10,780
has come to a definitive conclusion,

112
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:13,740
which is our Ruifeng car has no problems.

113
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,620
Mr. An, what I mean is…

114
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,720
Alright, don't say anymore.

115
00:06:17,728 --> 00:06:18,784
I'll speak for you.

116
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:22,319
I think what this particularly persistent
employee means is

117
00:06:22,839 --> 00:06:25,299
the person who can realize
this one-thousandth probability

118
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:26,439
is equivalent

119
00:06:29,504 --> 00:06:30,560
to a genius.

120
00:06:31,079 --> 00:06:32,359
If what Chen Mobai said is true,

121
00:06:32,359 --> 00:06:35,000
he is this one in a thousand genius.

122
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:36,896
Beautiful.

123
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:41,120
I've never admired you like I did today.

124
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:42,848
Mr. Mobai,

125
00:06:43,480 --> 00:06:44,699
you're basically telling Weishi

126
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:46,079
our Ruifeng's car has a problem.

127
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,720
If there really is a problem
and we don't face it,

128
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,160
we really don't deserve your investment.

129
00:06:54,016 --> 00:06:55,104
That's right.

130
00:06:57,399 --> 00:06:59,600
We hope to continue
to receive investment from Weishi,

131
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,759
but it's not based on avoiding problems.

132
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:05,800
No matter what the chance of a problem is,

133
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,260
Ruifeng has always been a company

134
00:07:07,260 --> 00:07:09,279
brave enough to confront questions
and solve problems.

135
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:12,120
The so-called overdue of Maituo

136
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,856
is also because we are

137
00:07:14,519 --> 00:07:15,920
daring to do what others dare not.

138
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,519
Miss Mofei's attitude

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,800
makes me want to give Ruifeng another chance.

140
00:07:24,399 --> 00:07:25,800
If Chen Mobai really is

141
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,919
that one in a thousand genius racer,

142
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:30,220
I think restarting the car program

143
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:31,260
may be a good way

144
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:33,560
to improve Ruifeng's brand.

145
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:37,319
Even if we really want to race,

146
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,480
it doesn't have to be Chen Mobai.

147
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:42,639
I can invite the best drivers
to achieve the same results.

148
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:44,240
Who drives I don't care.

149
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:47,560
But finding a new driver takes time.

150
00:07:48,399 --> 00:07:51,279
Can Ruifeng afford it
under current circumstances?

151
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,839
Does it mean

152
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,399
as long as I can get Chen Mobai back

153
00:07:59,959 --> 00:08:01,120
to rebuild Ruifeng Race Team,

154
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,000
we will continue to cooperate?

155
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Not really.

156
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,360
I've always only invested in the first place.

157
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,639
This weekend

158
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,700
is the Formula B season finale.

159
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:12,839
If Ruifeng can win the championship,

160
00:08:14,839 --> 00:08:17,079
I'll consider continuing to invest in Ruifeng.

161
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,639
I'll give you only one chance.

162
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,440
As for whether Chen Mobai can be on time

163
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:28,860
and whether he can get his race license back,

164
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:30,600
that's your own business.

165
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,279
To prove that our car has no problem

166
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,279
and Mobai wasn't racing recklessly

167
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:43,039
is not an easy task.

168
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,279
What I'm worried about isn't this.

169
00:08:47,424 --> 00:08:48,512
What are you worried about?

170
00:08:54,879 --> 00:08:57,000
I don't want to rely on him
to save the company,

171
00:08:58,559 --> 00:08:59,919
nor do I want him to continue racing.

172
00:09:00,639 --> 00:09:01,696
I understand.

173
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,799
But given the current situation,

174
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,260
it's an important turning point

175
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:07,600
for both the company and Mobai.

176
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,000
Over the past two years, you should have seen

177
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,840
he won't give up racing.

178
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,960
Instead of trying to stop him in vain,

179
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:16,600
why not find another way to protect him?

180
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,448
How is it?

181
00:09:37,504 --> 00:09:38,560
I knew it.

182
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,399
Chen Mofei's heart is like a rock.

183
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:44,640
Wait.

184
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,420
<i>[Vehicle Inspection Authorization]</i>
Our company will cooperate

185
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,960
with a third-party organization
to inspect the accident vehicle.

186
00:09:56,759 --> 00:09:58,279
If it's Ruifeng's responsibility,

187
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,480
Ruifeng will definitely
take full responsibility.

188
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,039
You guys finally said something human.

189
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,616
I'm leaving.

190
00:10:04,919 --> 00:10:06,080
Chen Mobai,

191
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,960
I didn't expect you to return to Ruifeng.

192
00:10:15,159 --> 00:10:17,360
Well, what else can we do?

193
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,639
The only way is to inspect the car.

194
00:10:20,840 --> 00:10:22,200
It's okay.

195
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,840
It's nothing to lower your head
to her for a dream.

196
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,900
Cut it out, I know you.

197
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:28,480
You've been wanting to go back to Ruifeng.

198
00:10:29,039 --> 00:10:31,600
You just want her
to invite you back ceremoniously.

199
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,440
It'll prove that she was wrong back then.

200
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:37,519
I found out that your IQ

201
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,860
was as high as my dad's blood pressure.

202
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:41,060
Thanks for today.

203
00:10:41,060 --> 00:10:42,060
The assist was good.

204
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,759
No need. It's me who should thank you.

205
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:46,680
You've helped me complete
my "kill three birds with one stone" plan.

206
00:10:46,680 --> 00:10:49,640
Now, the initiative to negotiate with Ruifeng
is in my hands.

207
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:51,000
It's really a good deal.

208
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:55,460
So you set all this up yourself.

209
00:10:55,460 --> 00:10:56,880
Don't act innocent after benefiting.

210
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,639
Think carefully about how to repay me.

211
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:00,639
Alright,

212
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:02,799
dinner, drinks, massage,
pick whatever you like.

213
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,919
Don't play dumb.

214
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:05,919
You know what I want.

215
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:07,340
Want to get married, huh?

216
00:11:07,340 --> 00:11:08,448
Chen Mobai,

217
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,320
if I can't see you at the bridal shop,

218
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:14,039
I can't guarantee
that I won't regret today's events.

219
00:11:15,879 --> 00:11:18,020
You won't, you're a businesswoman.

220
00:11:18,020 --> 00:11:19,140
I trust you.

221
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:20,440
I have something to do, so I'm leaving.

222
00:11:21,632 --> 00:11:22,688
Chen Mobai.

223
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,879
You almost had me killed today.

224
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,799
One in a thousand.

225
00:12:03,320 --> 00:12:04,879
Why didn't you calculate a smaller number?

226
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:09,159
I didn't think that much.

227
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,080
I was just telling the truth.

228
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:15,600
Just kidding.

229
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:18,639
Today, I need to thank you sincerely.

230
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,780
You said before

231
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,340
if I could prove your innocence,

232
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,440
you would give me the helmet.

233
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:25,679
Right.

234
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:27,639
But you didn't do this alone today.

235
00:12:28,159 --> 00:12:30,120
I'm telling you, if not
for the last-minute intervention,

236
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:31,440
I would have been done for.

237
00:12:32,120 --> 00:12:33,720
So, at most, you've done half the job today.

238
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:36,360
How does half work?

239
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,272
Half.

240
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:42,659
I'll split the helmet.

241
00:12:42,659 --> 00:12:44,300
How about one half each
for you and Zhao Yingning?

242
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:45,360
No way.

243
00:12:47,879 --> 00:12:48,896
Just kidding.

244
00:12:49,879 --> 00:12:51,039
Wait till I get my racing license back.

245
00:12:54,559 --> 00:12:55,840
How come you know so much about cars?

246
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,960
I don't know about cars.

247
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:03,840
I was talking about physics and math.

248
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,240
So, you trust math, not me.

249
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:12,400
In the world of math,

250
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,579
zero is zero and one is one.

251
00:13:14,579 --> 00:13:16,480
It's a trustworthy truth.

252
00:13:19,879 --> 00:13:21,879
You, an intelligent robot,
are pretty impressive.

253
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:24,840
But this emotion program

254
00:13:24,840 --> 00:13:26,840
has some bugs.

255
00:13:27,488 --> 00:13:28,608
How come?

256
00:13:29,159 --> 00:13:31,559
Math makes me trust my judgment of you more.

257
00:13:32,279 --> 00:13:34,579
It makes me realize
that you are an upright person

258
00:13:34,579 --> 00:13:36,320
and an excellent racing driver.

259
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,960
You fix these bugs pretty quickly.

260
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:44,759
How about having dinner together tonight?

261
00:13:45,952 --> 00:13:47,072
We can chat about math.

262
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:49,700
No need.

263
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:52,000
I need to go water at this time.

264
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,440
You, the robot, keep flowers?

265
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,919
No flowers. I grow sodium chloride crystals.

266
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,240
Sodium chloride crystals.

267
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:11,480
A strange person indeed.

268
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:18,960
Sir, why not forget about your identity
as the CEO of Weishi today?

269
00:14:18,960 --> 00:14:20,440
The skewers here are really delicious.

270
00:14:21,639 --> 00:14:24,699
Even you, the swift problem-solver,
are hesitating for once.

271
00:14:24,699 --> 00:14:25,919
It's the first time I've seen this.

272
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:30,020
You didn't dismiss the investment in Ruifeng.

273
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:32,140
Doesn't Chen Mofei even treat you

274
00:14:32,140 --> 00:14:33,340
to a decent meal?

275
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,759
I didn't say I won't,
just that it would be a bit later.

276
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:37,559
Sir, you should try some.

277
00:14:39,320 --> 00:14:40,720
Why later?

278
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:41,840
This doesn't seem like your style.

279
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:45,024
This weekend

280
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,440
will be the Formula B season finale.

281
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,159
I want to watch one more game.

282
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:51,240
With Chen Mobai participating,

283
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,700
the race will be much more exciting.

284
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,840
So, if he wins this race,

285
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:57,240
he will be the overall champion
in the points ranking.

286
00:14:58,799 --> 00:15:00,560
If he really wins,

287
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:02,159
how do you plan to wrap it up?

288
00:15:02,879 --> 00:15:04,679
Their biggest competitor this time, Junda,

289
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:07,720
has invited a Formula A team
from Japan to help.

290
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,960
If he can still win under these circumstances,

291
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:12,120
it proves that he is truly a potential asset.

292
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,248
I feel like it's worth gambling.

293
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:16,799
Miss, I remind you,

294
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:18,760
you are the one who proactively applied for

295
00:15:18,760 --> 00:15:20,400
our company's KPI that holds the most weight.

296
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,720
They allowed you to return to the country
because of this.

297
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:24,240
If you fail, you know

298
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:25,759
what you will face.

299
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:26,979
Actually, in these few days,

300
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:28,320
I snuck into Ruifeng to take a look.

301
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,799
I feel like they can overcome this difficulty.

302
00:15:33,152 --> 00:15:34,176
Why do you think so?

303
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:36,700
The success of a company

304
00:15:36,700 --> 00:15:39,320
just needs to be evaluated based on
what's printed on its walls, what it says,

305
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:42,579
what its employees are doing,
and what its customers are feeling.

306
00:15:42,579 --> 00:15:44,599
Regardless of from which aspect,

307
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,039
I believe they are performing admirably.

308
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:49,799
Moreover, I know

309
00:15:49,799 --> 00:15:51,000
the Chen siblings well.

310
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,320
Both in possible public and private scenarios,

311
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,039
they won't let Ruifeng go under.

312
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,440
Miss Mofei, people from Linhai Vehicle
Inspection Center have arrived.

313
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,919
Mr. Mobai's car is being inspected.

314
00:16:01,039 --> 00:16:02,360
Tell me when there are any updates.

315
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:03,456
Sure.

316
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:12,340

Okay, I got it. Continue checking elsewhere.

325
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,064
Okay.

Mom,

330
00:17:31,359 --> 00:17:34,680
I'm going to get something to eat nearby
and will be back soon.

331
00:17:36,416 --> 00:17:37,472
You rest first.

332
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:54,799
You're eating too little.

333
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:57,519
Your family are sick.

334
00:17:58,680 --> 00:17:59,720
You need to take good care of yourself.

335
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:07,740
I'm used to eating simply.

336
00:18:07,740 --> 00:18:09,279
That's a bad habit.

337
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,000
Aren't you going to ask
why I came to see you today?

338
00:18:15,359 --> 00:18:16,720
Why did you come to see me?

339
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,580
The car inspection results
will be out in a moment.

340
00:18:20,580 --> 00:18:22,440
I want to wait for the results with you.

341
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:27,319
To see if I am really that one in a thousand
you calculated.

342
00:18:32,768 --> 00:18:33,920
Do you know?

343
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:36,720
This race is especially important to me.

344
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,040
I must go.

345
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:42,220
There's a race every year.

346
00:18:42,220 --> 00:18:43,920
If not this time, there's always the next one.

347
00:18:45,559 --> 00:18:47,359
Only if I win this year's annual championship

348
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:51,960
will I have enough points
to participate in Formula A.

349
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:54,720

350
00:18:54,720 --> 00:18:56,119
he was already racing in Formula A.

351
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,640
I'm still in Formula B.

352
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,416

Of course.

00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:48,800
There's no problem.

363
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,279
There's no problem?

364
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:53,759
You didn't find any problems? Double check it.

365
00:19:54,599 --> 00:19:56,300
<i>I've watched them checking multiple times.</i>

366
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:58,559
Mofei is here in person.

367
00:19:59,279 --> 00:20:00,759
It won't change the outcome anyway.

368
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,040
<i>What can we do about this?</i>

369
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:13,536
It's a pity.

370
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,279
I'm not the genius you calculated.

371
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,680
Even though something hasn't been proven,

372
00:20:25,319 --> 00:20:26,920
it doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

373
00:20:46,799 --> 00:20:47,936
What to do now?

374
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,640
Ruifeng's car has no problem.

375
00:20:50,640 --> 00:20:51,759
It's within my expectation.

376
00:20:53,559 --> 00:20:55,440
As to whether Chen Mobai had been drag racing,

377
00:20:55,960 --> 00:20:57,024
I have nothing to say.

378
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,279
If all else fails, choose another driver.

379
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:01,839
Do you want to call Mobai?

380
00:21:02,759 --> 00:21:03,960
I have so much going on.

381
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:05,119
I can't care about his feelings.

382
00:21:10,519 --> 00:21:12,000
He has a hearing tomorrow.

383
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:13,952
I'll go see.

384
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,279
The car inspection did not find any problems.

385
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:23,640
So what to do at the hearing tomorrow?

386
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,880
Argue with them.

387
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:31,440
With my articulate tongue,
there may be a chance

388
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,960
to turn the game around.

389
00:21:37,119 --> 00:21:38,208
Hope all goes well.

390
00:21:39,552 --> 00:21:40,576
Okay.

391
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:43,279
I'll drop you off here.

392
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,319
We'll need you to testify tomorrow.

393
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,240
But don't be pressured.

394
00:21:49,079 --> 00:21:51,160
Just like the last time in the ward.

395
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:56,896
I'm leaving.

00:22:14,079 --> 00:22:15,599
<i>Chen Mofei dissolved the team.</i>

399

<i>Just this once.</i>

What's the matter?

405
00:22:39,079 --> 00:22:40,959
I'm from the administrative department.
I came to do some registration.

406
00:22:40,959 --> 00:22:42,272
So late.

407
00:22:42,272 --> 00:22:43,460
Now the circuit breaker is off,
there is no electricity.

408
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:45,039
You should walk this way with a flashlight.

409
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:46,656
Thank you.

00:24:08,759 --> 00:24:09,792
<i>Incorrect.</i>

422

<i>The added quick-release system
was auto-refueling?</i>

423
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:17,600
<i>Also incorrect.</i>

436
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,119
Inspiring.

Now we are inviting the witness.

443
00:25:37,160 --> 00:25:38,380
Shortly after the event,

444
00:25:38,380 --> 00:25:40,180
we initially inspected the vehicle.

445
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:42,519
It didn't reproduce the situation
he mentioned about the throttle losing control.

446
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:45,420
We were interviewing at the time.

447
00:25:45,420 --> 00:25:46,480
We video recorded the entire process.

448
00:25:47,359 --> 00:25:49,079
The car was indeed severely speeding.

On behalf of the Linhai Car Inspection Center

450
00:25:51,500 --> 00:25:53,400
we thoroughly checked the car.

Nothing abnormal was found.

doesn't mean there's no problem.

The witness is absent.

464
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:49,140
Chen Mobai, the evidence presenting process

465
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:50,319
is now completely over.

466
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:53,480
Please state your case.

467
00:27:03,232 --> 00:27:04,320
Regrettably,

468
00:27:06,759 --> 00:27:07,880
currently, all the evidence

469
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:11,319
can't reproduce the fact at the time.

470
00:27:13,519 --> 00:27:15,319
But the absence of evidence
doesn't mean its nonexistence.

471
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:18,920
Perhaps many people present

472
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,599
may think racing is an impulse,

473
00:27:22,519 --> 00:27:23,584
recklessness,

474
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,920
a pursuit of and addiction to speed,

475
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:28,440
but I don't see it that way.

476
00:27:30,784 --> 00:27:31,904
The racer

477
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,359
is a lonely explorer.

478
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:38,119
Whenever I rush to the finish line,

479
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:41,920
my excitement and joy
seem stuffed into a bottle,

480
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:44,119
corked up,

481
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,240
instantly sealed and reset to zero.

482
00:27:50,119 --> 00:27:51,680
My goal is never the finish line,

483
00:27:54,599 --> 00:27:55,759
but a place further afield.

484
00:27:57,536 --> 00:27:58,559
A racer

485
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:01,759
is also a bearer of responsibility.

486
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,839
Because racing is not a sport for one person,

487
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:08,039
but a sport for an entire team.

488
00:28:09,960 --> 00:28:11,720
I have to

489
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,519
strive for every second on the track

490
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:17,839
for every bit of effort my team have poured in

491
00:28:18,839 --> 00:28:20,439
and to strive for better results.

492
00:28:20,439 --> 00:28:21,559
That's my responsibility.

493
00:28:22,839 --> 00:28:23,872
Off the track,

494
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,559
I wouldn't do anything
to tarnish the reputation of racing,

495
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:31,480
nor would I pursue the thrill of speed

496
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:35,519
in any way.

497
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:37,740
As I face each track

498
00:28:37,740 --> 00:28:40,519
carved out by the lives
of my driving predecessors,

499
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:43,880
a sense of awe is my bottom line.

500
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,000
Though all evidence points against me now,

501
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,880
if I didn't do it, I didn't do it.

502
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,024
Alright,

503
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,400

we will announce the verdict.

507
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:11,480
The current situation is unfavorable for Mobai.

00:29:13,559 --> 00:29:14,880
There's nothing wrong with the car.

00:29:25,439 --> 00:29:26,500
My name is Wu Xiaobian.

00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,599
I run a racing public account.

512
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,760
I interviewed your brother in Europe before,

513
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:30,880
and you were there too.

514
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:33,920
Sorry, I have an urgent matter.

515
00:29:36,119 --> 00:29:37,880
Can you share some insider information
from back then?

516
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:40,880
Why did Markus hide the engineer's identity?

517
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,059
Who was that person, can you tell us a bit?

518
00:29:43,059 --> 00:29:44,128
I'm sorry.

519
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,319
Could you leave me a contact number then?

520
00:29:54,839 --> 00:29:57,439
Can you help me pass this file to that person?

521
00:29:57,439 --> 00:29:58,440
Please ask him to open it immediately.

522
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:00,768
Okay.

523
00:30:04,864 --> 00:30:05,920
Hello.

524
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,479
Someone asked me to give this to you.

525
00:30:08,479 --> 00:30:09,728
She asked you to open it immediately.

526
00:30:18,119 --> 00:30:20,359
After discussion by the committee members,

527
00:30:20,359 --> 00:30:21,560
we believe

528
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,200
race car driver Chen Mobai

529
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,279
has a genuine love for racing

530
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:29,880
and understands the bottom line
of a racer's profession.

531
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,939
However, the adjudication results

532
00:30:32,939 --> 00:30:35,440
must be based on evidence.

533
00:30:37,640 --> 00:30:38,920
According to the existing

534
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,200
various evidence materials,

535
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,279
including the investigation
of the traffic law enforcement department

536
00:30:44,279 --> 00:30:46,440
and appraisal reports,

537
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:47,720
we finally determined

00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,960
race car driver Chen Mobai's

Please wait a moment.

541
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,540
This is what we just received.

542
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:08,880
A supplemental technical report.

543
00:31:08,880 --> 00:31:09,960
There are new findings.

544
00:31:21,039 --> 00:31:22,440
What? How is that possible?

545
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:26,119
Please everyone be quiet, we need to confer.

546
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:58,179
The technical part
of the new material is very solid.

547
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:00,480
Yes, the evidence has been verified
by procedure.

548
00:32:01,039 --> 00:32:02,880
According to the latest supplemental evidence,

549
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,559
we have a new conclusion.

550
00:32:06,119 --> 00:32:08,640
The specific condition of the car
was as follows:

551
00:32:09,559 --> 00:32:13,420
A foreign body had gotten
into the back of the air filter.

552
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:14,759
Due to the suction of the intake air,

553
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,800
it blocked the throttle,

554
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,600
causing the accelerator
unable to shut down normally.

555
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,400
When the vehicle crashed,
the intake pipe cracked.

556
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:24,620
The foreign body slipped out through the crack.

557
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:27,160
So it wasn't reproducible

558
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,799
in subsequent inspections.

559
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:30,920
Given that the relevant department
has determined

560
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:33,519
that this is not a quality issue
with the vehicle

561
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,440
and there was no dangerous driving operation
by the driver,

562
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:39,839
we decide

563
00:32:39,839 --> 00:32:40,919
for Chen Mobai

564
00:32:40,919 --> 00:32:43,439
to rescind the decision
to revoke his racing license.

565
00:32:43,439 --> 00:32:44,608
Dismissed.

566
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:48,920
Clarified!

567
00:32:48,920 --> 00:32:51,880
Mobai, Mobai, innocence all over.

568
00:32:51,880 --> 00:32:55,039
Mobai, Mobai, innocence all over.

569
00:32:56,119 --> 00:32:57,519
The best result, congratulations!

570
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,200
Wasn't the problem not located?

571
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:03,480
Someone just provided supplementary evidence.

572
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,480
Who is it?

573
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,660
I'm not sure either at the moment.

574
00:33:06,660 --> 00:33:07,820
Who it is doesn't matter.

575
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,959
After all, it's someone who's helping us.

576
00:33:08,959 --> 00:33:11,200
At crucial times, there are still benefactors.

577
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,400
Then I'll buy a package of band-aid.

578
00:33:38,640 --> 00:33:40,080
<i>Let's meet at the aquarium this evening.</i>

579
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,200
<i>I will give you the helmet.</i>

580
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:06,400
Why would you choose to meet here?

581
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:09,679
Don't you like it here?

582
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,920
I saw your screensaver
the night you were cheated.

583
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,960
How do you know it's this one?

584
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,119
The bus you took only passes by this aquarium.

585
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:33,679
It takes some effort to get to know you.

586
00:34:40,760 --> 00:34:41,760
Where's the helmet?

587
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:44,000
Why didn't you bring the helmet?

588
00:34:45,344 --> 00:34:46,464
Here you go.

589
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,552
What's this supposed to mean?

590
00:34:53,280 --> 00:34:55,359
I thought you were a person who kept his word.

591
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:56,512
Of course I am.

592
00:34:57,039 --> 00:34:58,144
But

593
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,240
the person who made the report
is the real hero.

594
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,280
You only did some math problems that day.

595
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,520
You're just a minor contributor.

596
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:06,119
So, here's a small helmet for you.

597
00:35:08,608 --> 00:35:09,664
I have to go now.

598
00:35:10,559 --> 00:35:11,920
You still won't admit it, will you?

599
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:20,760
You must have been busy all night.

600
00:35:22,559 --> 00:35:24,039
Why would you hide it from me?

601
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,360
I already know, don't deny it anymore.

602
00:35:38,559 --> 00:35:40,760
Tell me, how did you come up with it?

603
00:35:44,064 --> 00:35:45,120
Sorry.

604
00:35:47,559 --> 00:35:49,800
I thought about the screw
that the repairman in the store knocked off

605
00:35:51,079 --> 00:35:53,119
plus the strange noise I heard in the car.

606
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,960
Could the screw have dropped in there?

607
00:35:57,119 --> 00:35:58,199
Finally, I thought about it.

608
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:00,119
It must be the throttle body.

609
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,859
For this kind of old car equipped
with a pull-wire accelerator,

610
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:05,040
if the throttle body hasn't been maintained
for a long time,

611
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:07,519
it's very likely to get blocked
by foreign objects and can't close.

612
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,480
Then it would result
in the throttle getting stuck.

613
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,119
Next, all we need to do is find this screw.

614
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,160
Why did you go looking alone?

615
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:58,176
Why didn't you call me?

616
00:36:58,719 --> 00:36:59,872
I don't need to.

617
00:37:00,599 --> 00:37:01,900
Two people would have to talk,

618
00:37:01,900 --> 00:37:03,039
which would actually slow things down.

619
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,440
That's how things are.

620
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:10,360
Can I have the helmet now?

621
00:37:11,079 --> 00:37:12,704
Sure, of course I can give it to you.

622
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,199
However,

623
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:16,920
as a reward for being recognized as a genius,

624
00:37:17,719 --> 00:37:18,752
can you do me a favor?

625
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:22,000
The day after tomorrow's Formula B finale
is very important to me.

626
00:37:22,559 --> 00:37:23,599
The ranking competition is tomorrow.

627
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:26,639
I want to bring Chuan's helmet to the venue,

628
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:29,159
just as if

629
00:37:30,360 --> 00:37:32,079
he could witness my important moment.

630
00:37:34,039 --> 00:37:35,039
As soon as this match is over,

631
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,440
I will definitely give you the helmet.

632
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,504
Alright,

633
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:54,639
I find you a really strange person.

634
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:56,360
You're so smart

635
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:58,336
and so talented.

636
00:37:58,336 --> 00:37:59,360
You can do

637
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:01,400
what many people can't.

638
00:38:02,559 --> 00:38:05,079
Why do you have to be a gopher in Ruifeng?

639
00:38:06,624 --> 00:38:07,680
Why is that?

640
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:11,280
That's my own business.

641
00:38:11,840 --> 00:38:12,896
I like to be a gopher.

642
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,079
Why is there only one fish
in such a big fish tank?

643
00:38:24,719 --> 00:38:25,824
This is a lionfish.

644
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,280
Some people call it the pest of the flock.

645
00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:30,559
Although it looks beautiful,

646
00:38:30,559 --> 00:38:31,780
it's highly toxic.

647
00:38:31,780 --> 00:38:33,800
All the fish that get close to it
will get hurt.

648
00:38:35,719 --> 00:38:38,039
Such fish can only live alone.

649
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,840
Strange knowledge has increased again.

650
00:38:46,360 --> 00:38:48,079
Don't you feel lonely as a fish in there?

651
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:50,440
You can find some hobbies,

652
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:52,800
like doing math problems,

653
00:38:54,199 --> 00:38:55,639
or keeping strange crystals or something.

654
00:38:56,256 --> 00:38:57,380
Don't always stay by yourself.

655
00:38:57,380 --> 00:38:58,400
Stay as a fish.

656
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:00,672
Right?

657
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:07,936
<i>[Ruifeng Group Employee
Onboarding Registration Form]</i>

658
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:11,552
Come in.

659
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,448
Miss Mofei, you were looking for me?

660
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,456
I heard

661
00:39:23,456 --> 00:39:24,680
that Chen Mobai's vehicle inspection report

662
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,599
was rushed out overnight by a young lady.

663
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:28,128
It was you, right?

664
00:39:29,719 --> 00:39:30,840
Why do you say that?

665
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:33,159
After the meeting with Weishi the other day,

666
00:39:33,159 --> 00:39:34,960
I took out your entry report.

667
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:38,679
Germany Institute of Technology.

668
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:40,960
Germany Institute of Technology.

669
00:39:42,280 --> 00:39:43,859
It's not easy to get into this university.

670
00:39:43,859 --> 00:39:45,039
What's your major?

671
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,840
Mechanical engineering and fluid dynamics.

672
00:39:51,480 --> 00:39:53,480
So why would you want to work
in the administrative department,

673
00:39:54,079 --> 00:39:55,136
working in office duties?

674
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,460
It's okay if you don't want to say.

675
00:39:59,460 --> 00:40:00,608
I won't make things difficult for you.

676
00:40:02,199 --> 00:40:03,719
However, you have identified issues

677
00:40:03,719 --> 00:40:04,840
that professionals have not identified.

678
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:06,920
This demonstrates that you are quite talented.

679
00:40:08,119 --> 00:40:10,039
Talented people should not be ignored.

680
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,400
You should transfer
to the technical department.

681
00:40:15,559 --> 00:40:16,608
Thanks, Miss Mofei,

682
00:40:17,152 --> 00:40:18,208
but I don't need it.

683
00:40:18,880 --> 00:40:21,599
I am currently not capable
of performing technical work.

684
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:23,360
Besides, my mother is ill.

685
00:40:24,159 --> 00:40:26,320
I have to spend time taking good care of her.

686
00:40:27,639 --> 00:40:28,736
Let's leave it at this then.

687
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:32,960
I'll get to work now.

688
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:45,000
Mobai has just started a qualifying race.

689
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,080
How is it?

690
00:40:46,599 --> 00:40:48,832
Unideal, currently ranking beyond 5th.

691
00:40:49,519 --> 00:40:50,720
So far behind?

692
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:53,568
It's okay.

693
00:40:54,144 --> 00:40:55,232
He

694
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,679
grows stronger under pressure.

695
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,920
Let's see his performance later on.

696
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:03,719
The qualifying race is too suffocating.

697
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,200
The car broke down after running
for just two laps.

698
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,539
Just as the car was finally fixed,

699
00:41:07,539 --> 00:41:08,608
there wasn't enough time to run anymore.

700
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:11,519
So in other words,
you were just too slow, right?

701
00:41:11,519 --> 00:41:12,599
Stop making unfounded accusations.

702
00:41:12,599 --> 00:41:13,880
I have never seen anyone faster than Gong.

703
00:41:15,320 --> 00:41:17,280
Isn't the car you built yourself like this?

704
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:18,920
Performance depends entirely on luck.

705
00:41:18,920 --> 00:41:20,840
Fortunately, we have already
resolved the problem.

706
00:41:20,840 --> 00:41:22,519
I am sure we can make it
to the official race tomorrow.

707
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:24,940
Nonsense. Lu Yunhao's car is so good.

708
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,160
Tomorrow he will be at the pole position.

709
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,000
Won't we get beaten senselessly?

710
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,760
Do you know how Shen Chuan

711
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,320
made it to the Super Grand Prix?

712
00:41:33,960 --> 00:41:36,199
At the time, Chuan encountered a problem
with his car in the last Formula B race.

713
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,519
The car was in trouble,
and he started from the very last.

714
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,260
But ultimately he won the championship
by a full second.

715
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:43,424
He became a legend in one fight.

716
00:41:48,608 --> 00:41:49,664
My 8th place is at least much better

717
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,159
than starting from the bottom, right?

718
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,440
But that was Shen Chuan.

719
00:41:58,440 --> 00:41:59,552
No matter who it is,

720
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:03,800
as a racer, you should never
lose heart prematurely.

721
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:06,360
That's the ultimate charm of racing.

722
00:42:07,159 --> 00:42:08,159
Until the final second,

723
00:42:09,280 --> 00:42:10,280
no one knows the outcome.

724
00:42:45,600 --> 00:42:46,688
How did you come?

725
00:42:47,360 --> 00:42:48,416
I came to pick you up.

726
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,680
Pick me up for what? I have to work.

727
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:53,199
You don't need to go to work.

728
00:42:53,199 --> 00:42:54,440
I had Qiao Na assign you a new task.

729
00:42:54,960 --> 00:42:55,968
What task?

730
00:42:56,880 --> 00:42:58,559
Come to the race track with me.

731
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:00,599
What am I going to do at the race track?

732
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,072
Cheer me on.

733
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,800
Hello, Mr. Lu Yunhao.

734
00:43:06,800 --> 00:43:09,000
Any thoughts on starting
from the pole position today?

735
00:43:09,639 --> 00:43:11,579
Firstly, I want to thank the Junda Group

736
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:12,736
for their full support.

737
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:21,560
Monkey, hurry up and do the final adjustments.

738
00:43:21,560 --> 00:43:23,220
Chubby, Xu Gong, how's it going?

739
00:43:23,220 --> 00:43:24,896
Chen Mobai, let go of me.

740
00:43:24,896 --> 00:43:26,000
Since you're here…

741
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,040
Chen Mobai.

742
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:29,040
Just enjoy the results of our struggle

743
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,320
and witness my victory.

744
00:43:30,920 --> 00:43:32,160
What a great atmosphere.

745
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:33,359
You finally came.

746
00:43:33,359 --> 00:43:35,280
I was afraid that Lu Yunhao
might get lucky today.

747
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:36,288
How could it be?

748
00:43:36,288 --> 00:43:37,500
Mobai, the car is almost ready.

749
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:38,760
I'll check the engine again.

750
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,840
Don't even think about leaving.

751
00:43:43,712 --> 00:43:44,800
Watch me race.

752
00:43:45,840 --> 00:43:46,880
Guys,

753
00:43:49,199 --> 00:43:50,272
let's get started.

754
00:44:03,124 --> 00:44:07,604
<i>♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫</i>

755
00:44:09,524 --> 00:44:14,128
<i>♫ The heart gradually silences ♫</i>

756
00:44:15,508 --> 00:44:22,096
<i>♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫</i>

757
00:44:22,096 --> 00:44:27,184
<i>♫ I can't delete them ♫</i>

758
00:44:28,244 --> 00:44:34,256
<i>♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫</i>

759
00:44:34,256 --> 00:44:41,136
<i>♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫</i>

760
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:49,584
<i>♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫</i>

761
00:44:50,420 --> 00:44:54,416
<i>♫ Fading away ♫</i>

762
00:44:55,572 --> 00:45:02,064
<i>♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫</i>

763
00:45:02,064 --> 00:45:08,432
<i>♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫</i>

764
00:45:09,908 --> 00:45:16,784
<i>♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫</i>

765
00:45:16,784 --> 00:45:21,136
<i>♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫</i>

766
00:45:21,136 --> 00:45:27,504
<i>♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫</i>

767
00:45:27,504 --> 00:45:34,256
<i>♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫</i>

768
00:45:34,256 --> 00:45:41,584
<i>♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫</i>

769
00:45:41,584 --> 00:45:51,184
<i>♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫</i>
