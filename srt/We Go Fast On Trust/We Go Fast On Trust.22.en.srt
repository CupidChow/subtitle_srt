15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:40,704
For so many years,

16
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,560
I've been stopping you
under the name of protection and love

17
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,599
from doing what you want to do.

18
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:53,952
I am sorry.

19
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:00,288
So,

20
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,680
I solemnly tell you,

21
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,780
do not change your path

22
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,120
for Ruifeng or for me.

23
00:02:10,039 --> 00:02:11,039
I haven't changed my path.

24
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,800
I've just made our paths one.

25
00:02:18,048 --> 00:02:19,120
I know

26
00:02:21,199 --> 00:02:22,800
you've been fighting alone all along,

27
00:02:26,752 --> 00:02:27,776
surrounded by enemies on all sides.

28
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,039
You may have long forgotten the feeling
of traveling with others.

29
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,639
But you and I share the same blood.

30
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,680
I am more so the teammate who is willing

31
00:02:43,199 --> 00:02:45,319
to believe in you without reservations
when you need it most.

32
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:49,960
So no matter which road,

33
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:52,800
as long as we worked hard

34
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,136
and paid the price,

35
00:02:57,792 --> 00:02:58,816
that's enough.

36
00:03:16,608 --> 00:03:17,728
Chen Mofei,

37
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,319
you are not just a successful businesswoman.

38
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:27,680
You are also the sister who makes her younger
brother the proudest in the entire world.

39
00:03:43,296 --> 00:03:44,416

Is Formula E very hard?

44
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,720
It's really hard.

45
00:04:23,399 --> 00:04:24,720

or competition rules,

48
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:31,759
they are all totally different
from traditional Formula racing.

49
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:34,040
If you really want to compete,

50
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,199
it means the entire team
has to start from scratch.

51
00:04:37,472 --> 00:04:38,560
What else is there?

52
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,199
Well,

53
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:42,220
this year,

54
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:44,480
the competitors are top manufacturers' teams
from various countries.

55
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,140
If we want to win,

56
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,279
the odds are not that great.

57
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:52,120
I've noticed that you're such a person.

58
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:55,360
Can't you just lie a little bit
from time to time

59
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,439
to encourage me?

60
00:04:58,079 --> 00:05:00,780
I thought we didn't need such lies between us.

61
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,800
Of course, we don't need that.

62
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,079
I didn't say you were wrong.

63
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:07,040
I just feel that occasionally
there should be a little bit of

64
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,519
small fun or a little romance.

65

67
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:20,672
Milk tea.

68
00:05:20,672 --> 00:05:21,760

Okay, please wait a moment.

70

I have a very romantic story.

71
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:30,820
Tsiolkovsky and his rocket theory.

72
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,839

sure this is very romantic?

75
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:42,820
At his time,

76
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,720
the Wright Brothers just invented the airplane.

77
00:05:45,439 --> 00:05:47,480
Only Tsiolkovsky believed

78
00:05:48,839 --> 00:05:50,900
that we could not only fly into the sky.

79
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:53,000
One day, we could also fly out of the Earth.

80

calculating and imagining.

81

We finally saw the full view
of this blue planet.

85
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,879
It finally proved that his formula was correct.

86
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:13,408
He said,

87

"The Earth is the cradle of mankind.

88
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:17,280
But perhaps

89
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:20,199
we don't have to stay in this cradle forever."

90
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,128
You're right.

91

Exactly, electric cars also need repair.

117

To advance from Formula A
to the Super Grand Prix,

118
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,000
you need to win the championship
for consecutive seasons.

119

It's pretty good.

214
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,960
I know some designs are bold.

215
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,039

How could it be too aggressive?

221
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:04,416
It isn't aggressive.

222
00:14:04,416 --> 00:14:05,536
I just feel

223
00:14:06,039 --> 00:14:08,919

I think this part

233
00:14:36,260 --> 00:14:38,620
should be completed by all of us together.

234
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,780
Alright.

235
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:41,080
Then I have to show off my skills.

236
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,480
Count me in.

237
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,180
About the overseas parts you asked me to order,

238
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,940
I have completed all the orders.

239
00:14:45,940 --> 00:14:48,740
Xu Gong, install them into the car
as soon as they arrive.

240
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:49,979
Be ready at any time.

241
00:14:49,979 --> 00:14:52,559
Everything is within the plan.

Skyfall!

246
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,216
Toyama Hikoshi.

247
00:15:05,216 --> 00:15:06,219
Yes.

248
00:15:06,219 --> 00:15:07,780
What do you think of Ruifeng Race Team

249
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:09,759
signing up for

250
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:14,720
the Super Formula E Grand Prix?

251
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:18,320
Recent victories have made them arrogant.

252
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,384
I don't think

253
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,799
switching tracks at will

254
00:15:22,799 --> 00:15:23,960
is so easy.

255
00:15:25,720 --> 00:15:30,399
We can't underestimate the opponent.

256
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:34,720
Their goal is very clear.

257
00:15:35,919 --> 00:15:38,680
The race is in Europe,

258
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:42,639
the super market of electric cars.

259
00:15:43,879 --> 00:15:47,200
Use Formula E to pave the way

260
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:49,679
and open up the market
for Ruifeng electric cars

261
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:52,559
in Europe.

262
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,159
If we let them succeed,

263
00:15:56,879 --> 00:15:58,159
it will inevitably have a great impact

264
00:15:58,159 --> 00:15:59,320
on our current market share.

265
00:16:00,679 --> 00:16:01,980
I will immediately submit the process.

266
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:04,759
Give more support to the Takano Formula E team.

267
00:16:05,519 --> 00:16:06,600
I have confidence.

268
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,639
We will never lose to them on the track again.

269
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:12,679
Don't talk to me about confidence.

270
00:16:13,919 --> 00:16:18,799
I want a hundred percent certainty.

271
00:16:19,776 --> 00:16:20,839
Well…

272
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,880
Not allowing the opponent to enter the field

273
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:25,320
is the safest.

274
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:27,519
How to do it?

275
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,639
If you want the opponent to submit,

276
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:33,792
first,

277
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,159
you have to choke his neck.

278
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,799
Understood, I'll do it right away.

279
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,380
Sir, there is a man surnamed Jiang
at the door looking for you.

280
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,480
Is he your guest?

281
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,000
It must be Jiang Yijun again.

282
00:16:48,679 --> 00:16:50,560
Junda has already

283
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,200
sent us their brake technology data.

284
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,879
It's not so easy to escape this deal.

285
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,840
I can afford the price.

286
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:03,080
Wanting to root in Japan as an agent

287
00:17:04,039 --> 00:17:05,680
and to enter the Japanese market

288
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,839
is wishful thinking.

289
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:14,048
Sorry, we don't know him.

290
00:17:14,656 --> 00:17:15,720
Please ask him to leave.

291
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:16,759
Okay, understood.

292
00:17:28,839 --> 00:17:30,959
Sir, Mr. Takano said he didn't know you.

293
00:17:30,959 --> 00:17:32,039
Please leave.

294
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:34,480
What? How is that possible?

295
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:37,400
Sir, this is a VIP restaurant in the hotel.

296
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,432
Please leave.

297
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:40,128
Step aside.

298
00:17:49,088 --> 00:17:50,112
Let's go.

299
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,720
Hello, I'm Hao Yang.

300
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,680
Has a package arrived these past two days?

301
00:17:57,519 --> 00:17:59,559
Yes, large one, parts for the race team.

302
00:18:01,056 --> 00:18:02,176
What?

303
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,776
It was recalled?

304
00:18:04,519 --> 00:18:05,680
Did they say what happened?

305
00:18:06,839 --> 00:18:09,119
Okay, I'll call the express company.

306
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:11,360
What's going on?

307
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:14,200
Originally, a part would arrive today.

308
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:15,808
Said it was recalled.

309
00:18:16,519 --> 00:18:18,519
It's okay, I'll go and see what's happening.

310
00:18:24,192 --> 00:18:25,312
What's going on?

311
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,400
The parts we ordered from abroad
were cancelled.

312
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:31,392
Cancelled?

313
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:34,304
Which part?

314
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:35,400
A lot.

315
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:36,559
A lot?

316
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:37,760
That's strange.

317
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,400
Recalling and cancellation.

318
00:18:41,359 --> 00:18:42,359
As if they've negotiated it in advance.

319
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,480
I know these manufacturers.

320
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,360
I'll give them a call

321
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:48,480
to see what's happening.

322
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,456
Okay, I got it.

323
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,024
How is it?

324
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:12,256
It's Takano.

325
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,820
They somehow managed

326
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,479
to put pressure
on overseas parts manufacturers,

327
00:19:16,479 --> 00:19:18,319
forbidding them to sell
racing-grade parts to us.

328
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:20,960
What kind of move is that?

329
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,880
Technology blockade.

330
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,920
Takano wants to limit us technically.

331
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:26,599
Well, why?

332
00:19:26,599 --> 00:19:27,760
To get back for Mitsui Taku?

333
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,599
This is no longer a matter between the teams.

334
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:32,200
It's a competition between Takano and Ruifeng.

335
00:19:32,759 --> 00:19:34,279
This is clearly unfair competition!

336
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,359
So what do we do now?

337
00:19:36,359 --> 00:19:38,799
Is there no hope at all?

338
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:38,720
They really did it thoroughly.

339
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,960
One can't make bricks without straw.

340
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:43,240
Let's complain about Takano.

341
00:20:43,960 --> 00:20:45,480
They must have negotiated this privately.

342
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:47,240
Even if we complained to the Galaxy Guardians,

343
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,256
it wouldn't work.

344
00:20:50,279 --> 00:20:52,240
Mobai, why don't you say something?

345
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,880
I see.

346
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:01,376
How about we change our thinking?

347
00:21:02,359 --> 00:21:03,860
Participating in Formula E

348
00:21:03,860 --> 00:21:05,700
is to promote the Ruifeng brand.

349
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,559
But to truly grow strong, we can't be held back
by foreign constraints.

350
00:21:09,119 --> 00:21:11,519
Actually, we don't have to rely too much
on foreign technology.

351
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,039
We can use parts from domestic manufacturers.

352
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:17,160
Each domestic car company
has its own technological strength.

353
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,320
As long as they are willing to customize,

354
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:21,440
if we can make up for these parts,
there will be no problem.

355
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,296
That's a good idea.

356
00:21:24,279 --> 00:21:25,359
Using our own strength.

357
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,420
Independent research and development.

358
00:21:27,420 --> 00:21:28,640
Let me see.

359
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,039
Or perhaps

360
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,720
we should consider other options.

361
00:21:37,759 --> 00:21:39,079
What's with that expression?
Come on, let me see.

362
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:46,120
Junda's brake system.

363
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,759
Mobai, Junda.

364
00:21:48,599 --> 00:21:49,760
They're our number one enemy.

365
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,920
How could they possibly help us?

366
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,039
Shen Xi, perhaps we should
turn to another company.

367
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,500
Currently, only Junda's brake system

368
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,039
meets Formula level standards.

369
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,279
Whether we move forward or retreat is up to us.

370
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,799
We can only move forward, no going back.

371
00:22:09,799 --> 00:22:11,359
We're not fighting alone.

372
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:14,559
We have Ruifeng backing us.

373
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:16,359
There will always be more solutions
than problems.

374
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:19,488
Correct.

375
00:22:20,319 --> 00:22:21,408
We have Mofei.

376
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,104
And Miss Zhao.

377
00:22:23,104 --> 00:22:24,192
We will definitely succeed.

378
00:22:24,192 --> 00:22:25,200
And me.

379
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:26,919
I'll call my dad.

380
00:22:26,919 --> 00:22:28,599
These manufacturers might know him.

381
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:31,680
After all, we're a family of mechanics.

382
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:34,799
Look.

383
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,200
The location of Skyfall.

384
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,160
Facing the sea, with spring flowers blossoming.

385
00:22:39,160 --> 00:22:40,480
No difficulty

386
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,119
can block us.

387
00:22:43,079 --> 00:22:44,760
Right, I'll also call my dad.

388
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,180
What are you calling your dad for?

389
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,680
To have my dad contact Xu Gong's dad.

390
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,376
It's bound to be successful.

391
00:22:51,119 --> 00:22:53,319
We will break each and every obstacle.

392
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:55,380
We will smash each stumbling block.

393
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,200
Smash apart!

394
00:23:23,072 --> 00:23:24,160
Okay, Mr. Chen.

395
00:23:25,079 --> 00:23:27,079
Thank you for your strong support
for our Ruifeng Motors.

396
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,880
I'll have the team contact you directly.

397
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:32,288
Okay, bye-bye.

398
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,219
You should give Mobai a call quickly.

399
00:23:35,219 --> 00:23:37,559
Nanshan Heavy Industries can produce
the racing shock absorbers they need.

400
00:23:37,559 --> 00:23:38,624
Okay.

401
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:50,688
Hao.

402
00:23:53,184 --> 00:23:54,272
Mr. Mobai.

403
00:23:58,279 --> 00:23:59,500
Who knew that one day.

404
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,359
the demon king would come for my assistance?

405
00:24:02,279 --> 00:24:04,119
But you want me to take you to Jiang Yijun.

406
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:06,480
To get Junda's brake system for you.

407
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,832
Are you daydreaming?

408
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:12,160
If not for the predicament
Ruifeng is in right now

409
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,960
and we are choked by others
when the competition is approaching,

410
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,640
we wouldn't want to rely on others like this,
eating off others' plate, pleading.

411
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,640
But now that I've made up my mind
to walk down this road,

412
00:24:25,024 --> 00:24:26,208
no matter how difficult it is,

413
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:29,056
I will keep going.

414
00:24:33,920 --> 00:24:35,079
I admire your courage,

415
00:24:36,279 --> 00:24:37,280
but you've found the wrong person.

416
00:24:38,119 --> 00:24:39,240
I'm getting paid by Jiang Yijun.

417
00:24:39,759 --> 00:24:41,000
I can't bite the hand that feeds me.

418
00:24:42,464 --> 00:24:43,540
Sorry, I can't help.

419
00:24:43,540 --> 00:24:44,920
You keep getting suppressed
by Takano and Mitsui.

420
00:24:44,920 --> 00:24:46,160
Don't you want to raise your eyebrows
and vent your spleen for once?

421
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,408
During the training camp,

422
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,720
I saw in you

423
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,400
the dignity that a professional racer
should have.

424
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:58,848
If you want my help,

425
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,544
how is the bill calculated?

426
00:25:04,519 --> 00:25:05,632
How much do you want?

427
00:25:09,480 --> 00:25:10,640
Are you looking down on me?

428
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:13,184
I have another car.

429
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,976
Triple speed, specially tuned.

430
00:25:15,519 --> 00:25:16,559
You do it in person.

431
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,192
Deal.

432
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:24,800
Thanks, Bro.

433
00:25:26,319 --> 00:25:28,880
Okay, okay. Enough sugar-coating. Gotta go now.

434
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,319
Is there something wrong with your head?

435
00:25:35,880 --> 00:25:36,920
If Chen Mobai wins,

436
00:25:36,920 --> 00:25:38,579
Chinese people will show their faces
in the international car racing world.

437
00:25:38,579 --> 00:25:40,240
Honestly, it's also beneficial to you.

438
00:25:40,759 --> 00:25:42,819
Furthermore, the one they are participating in
is Formula E.

439
00:25:42,819 --> 00:25:44,064
We don't have a competitive relationship.

440
00:25:44,064 --> 00:25:45,120
Enough.

441
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:47,600
You clearly know that we're cooperating
with Takano right now.

442
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,679
You want me to give the brake system
to Ruifeng.

443
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,020
Isn't that blatantly breaking up with Takano?

444
00:25:52,020 --> 00:25:54,040
Even cooperation should be fair, right?

445
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,800
You're just being played right now.

446
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:56,864
Enough.

447
00:25:57,408 --> 00:25:58,439
If Ruifeng revives,

448
00:25:58,439 --> 00:25:59,440
what good does it do you?

449
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:01,460
I'm already kind to them

450
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,680
by not stepping on them when they're down.

451
00:26:03,599 --> 00:26:05,160
You're asking me to give a gun
to my competitor?

452
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,792
Cool!

453
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:22,359
We're just waiting for the two of you now.

454
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,400
Well, what are you guys doing?

455
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:29,400
Miss Zhao

456
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,839
has come up with a good plan.

457
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:32,940
Start a short video channel.

458
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,200
Promote online.

459
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,500
In this way, everyone can better understand
the Ruifeng Race Team

460
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:39,399
and know what we are normally doing.

461
00:26:39,399 --> 00:26:42,200
Thus gaining widespread support

462
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:43,872
from the entire auto industry.

463
00:26:43,872 --> 00:26:45,640
So what should we do specifically?

464
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,759
Feel free to voice your thoughts.

465
00:26:47,759 --> 00:26:49,680
For instance, why you guys gather together,

466
00:26:49,680 --> 00:26:50,940
or why you chose this industry.

467
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,020
Say whatever you want to say.

468
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:54,799
In this regard, Mobai is the specialist.

469
00:26:55,359 --> 00:26:57,839
Besides, Mobai's handsome look will definitely
attract fans.

470
00:26:58,464 --> 00:26:59,480
What do you mean?

471
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:01,160
The manager's good looks
will attract more fans.

472
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:06,000
I just want everyone to know,

473
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:08,400
whether you're a racer

474
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:09,839
or someone involved in this industry,

475
00:27:10,680 --> 00:27:13,180
it's not really that distant
from our daily lives.

476
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:14,780
I think we are also a bunch

477
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:17,039
of ordinary people striving for dreams.

478
00:27:18,039 --> 00:27:19,104
That's it.

479
00:27:19,104 --> 00:27:20,160
Well said.

480
00:27:20,839 --> 00:27:21,880
Our dream

481
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,000
is to let them know

482
00:27:24,599 --> 00:27:27,920
how good and powerful our cars are.

483
00:27:28,519 --> 00:27:30,299
We want the whole world to know

484
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:33,960
we can also manufacture the best cars.

485
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:36,760
If we successfully promote this,

486
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:38,680
wouldn't Mobai become an online celebrity?

487
00:27:40,319 --> 00:27:41,520
Okay, just say

488
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:42,540
what you just said later.

489
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,616
Quick, quick, get ready.

490
00:27:43,616 --> 00:27:45,279
Come on, get into positions.

491
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:47,839
Come on, on a count of three, shout "Cool".

492
00:27:48,559 --> 00:27:49,600
Come on.

493
00:27:51,440 --> 00:27:53,160
- Alright, alright.
- Let's begin.

494
00:27:53,720 --> 00:27:57,460
Three, two, one.

495
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,680
- Start.
- Cool.

496
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:02,539
Hello, everyone.

497
00:28:02,539 --> 00:28:05,339
Today is the inaugural live stream
for our Ruifeng Race Team.

498
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:08,279
Let me introduce our racing driver, Chen Mobai.

499
00:28:28,367 --> 00:28:30,336
[Handong Automobile Company]

500
00:28:54,368 --> 00:28:55,456
Excuse me.

501
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,720
- Chairman.
- Mr. Zhang.

502
00:28:58,720 --> 00:28:59,776
Chairman,

503
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:01,780
there's trouble.

504
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,659
Can't even knock on the door now?

505
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,759
No, no, there is big trouble.

506
00:29:05,359 --> 00:29:06,519
Take a look.

507
00:29:06,519 --> 00:29:09,000
Takano surprisingly announced a partnership
with Chengdai.

508
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,000
They'll help them upgrade their technology
to enter the Japanese market.

509
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:12,599
Were we played?

510
00:29:26,560 --> 00:29:27,579
Hello.

511
00:29:27,579 --> 00:29:30,320
Toyama, you finally answered the phone.

512
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,880
What's the situation with today's news?

513
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:33,600
Could you explain it to us?

514
00:29:34,400 --> 00:29:36,540
Mr. Jiang, our Takano doesn't have to

515
00:29:36,540 --> 00:29:38,160
nor do we need to explain to you.

516
00:29:39,559 --> 00:29:40,704
What do you mean?

517
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,300
Your Junda's cars

518
00:29:43,300 --> 00:29:44,920
don't qualify at all to collaborate

519
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,460
with a company like Takano,

520
00:29:46,460 --> 00:29:47,839
let alone

521
00:29:47,839 --> 00:29:49,339
wishfully thinking about us leading you

522
00:29:49,339 --> 00:29:50,759
into the overseas sales market.

523
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,960
With such a low level of technology of yours,

524
00:29:54,359 --> 00:29:55,480
it's really not our fault
for looking down on you.

525
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:56,544
You!

526
00:29:56,544 --> 00:29:58,679
Okay, okay, stop wasting my time.

527
00:29:58,679 --> 00:29:59,744
Goodbye.

528
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,340
Chairman, what do we do next?

529
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,640
How would I know?

530
00:30:09,696 --> 00:30:10,848
Get out.

531
00:30:11,936 --> 00:30:12,992
Okay.

532
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:25,599
Dared to belittle our technology?

533
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:35,319
Hydraulic valve,
customized by Mingbo Technology.

534
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,640
Gearbox, provided by Longchun Group.

535
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,559
Rear suspension,
from Handong Automobile Company.

536
00:30:42,119 --> 00:30:44,319
Now, all the parts we need

537
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:45,600
are according to

538
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:46,960
our demands.

539
00:30:47,519 --> 00:30:49,480
Only the braking system is missing.

540
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,799
Without brakes,

541
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:53,460
our progress will have to brake.

542
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,480
Now everyone is just idling here.

543
00:30:57,599 --> 00:30:58,680
If it really doesn't work,
change to another one.

544
00:31:00,279 --> 00:31:01,480
Only one component is unqualified,

545
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:02,599
it shouldn't greatly impact it.

546
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:05,920
How can we lower our standards?

547
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:11,720
Did you forget what you said yourself?

548
00:31:12,559 --> 00:31:14,480
If you lower your standards
on the equipment today,

549
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,279
tomorrow on the track,

550
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,880
you will only be able
to strive for a lower place.

551
00:31:21,319 --> 00:31:23,200
If you want to use one, use the best.

552
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,480
Don't let others joke about us internationally.

553
00:31:27,136 --> 00:31:28,160
Those who don't know

554
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,439
would think that China

555
00:31:29,439 --> 00:31:30,880
does not have good brake technology.

556
00:31:35,960 --> 00:31:37,200
This is the information
for our independently developed

557
00:31:37,720 --> 00:31:39,359
high performance braking system.

558
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,248
Go ahead and use it.

559
00:31:50,912 --> 00:31:52,480
[Junda Automobile Co., Ltd.
Brake System Manual]

560
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:54,839
However, I have a condition.

561
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:57,824
Once on the racetrack,

562
00:31:58,599 --> 00:31:59,820
never be timid.

563
00:31:59,820 --> 00:32:00,864
Let them see

564
00:32:01,408 --> 00:32:02,500
what the Chinese

565
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:03,720
are truly capable of.

566
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,064
Thank you, Mr. Jiang.

567
00:32:08,064 --> 00:32:09,280
You don't need to thank me.

568
00:32:10,119 --> 00:32:11,640
To be honest, I'm also doing it for myself.

569
00:32:12,240 --> 00:32:14,319
The unfair treatment Ruifeng faced today

570
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:17,559
could become the predicament faced

571
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,079
by all Chinese car companies tomorrow.

572
00:32:20,319 --> 00:32:21,408
So,

573
00:32:21,408 --> 00:32:23,799
this time, I'm not only
providing technology support

574
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:24,960
but also manpower.

575
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,819
Let Yunhao join the Ruifeng Race Team

576
00:32:26,819 --> 00:32:29,039
and assist you in the competition.

577
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,359
What we need to do now
is not to fight among ourselves,

578
00:32:32,039 --> 00:32:33,519
but to band together

579
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:35,319
and work towards improving

580
00:32:36,832 --> 00:32:37,920
the international image of Chinese cars.

581
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,480
Don't worry, Mr. Jiang.

582
00:32:49,799 --> 00:32:50,944
I will definitely not let you down.

Give it to me.

601
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,500
Let me say something.

602
00:34:16,500 --> 00:34:17,639
First, let me congratulate you all.

603
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:20,240
Congratulations on going to Spain tomorrow.

00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:21,720
I hope you all achieve good results.

00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,780
Thank you, Miss Mofei.

606
00:34:22,780 --> 00:34:24,800
Everyone, together.

607
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,599
- Cheers.
- I think I heard

608
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:28,239
the victory horn has already sounded.

609
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,160
Yes, it has already sounded.

610
00:34:31,160 --> 00:34:32,440
Come on, let's drink.

611
00:34:34,280 --> 00:34:35,456
Thank you

612
00:34:36,280 --> 00:34:37,536
for accompanying me to fulfill my dream.

613
00:34:38,559 --> 00:34:39,559
This is also my dream.

614
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,119
You two are really mushy.

615
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,840
I'll take a call.

616
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,400
Eat up, eat up, eat.

617
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:54,060
Well, you guys go ahead. I have a call too.

618
00:34:54,060 --> 00:34:55,320
- Here, Mobai.
- Enjoy your meal.

619
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:57,639
Eat, eat.

620
00:34:58,480 --> 00:35:00,800
Double check the flights and hotels
for tomorrow.

621
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:01,920
Don't let any issue arise.

622
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,664
Okay.

623

Why?

627
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:25,440
Thanks anyway

628
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,040
to have you along the way.

629
00:35:28,416 --> 00:35:29,440
In the future,

630
00:35:30,719 --> 00:35:31,744
you have me too.

631
00:35:33,039 --> 00:35:34,119

This is the first time

I've seen Yang be so manly

645
00:36:44,340 --> 00:36:45,719
since I've known him for so long.

646
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:49,280
When will you give your Engineer Liu

647
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:50,688

Are you really not going
to the competition with Mobai?

657
00:37:35,968 --> 00:37:37,088
No, I'm not going.

658
00:37:38,079 --> 00:37:39,168
I trust them.

659
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:44,159
Besides,

660
00:37:44,159 --> 00:37:45,519
they don't have
my favorite instant noodles there.

661
00:37:48,224 --> 00:37:49,248
People always say

662
00:37:49,960 --> 00:37:51,008
one needs to learn to change

663
00:37:51,519 --> 00:37:52,608
and to accept the new.

664
00:37:53,880 --> 00:37:55,400
But you, you've been the same for ten years.

665
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:00,679
If now is the best,

666
00:38:04,199 --> 00:38:05,280
why change?

667
00:38:09,696 --> 00:38:10,784
I'm hungry.

668
00:38:11,968 --> 00:38:17,715
♫ In the sea of life, you are the only light ♫

669
00:38:18,272 --> 00:38:23,960

671
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:29,639
The race is about to start.

672
00:38:32,039 --> 00:38:33,280
Why do you seem so quiet?

673
00:38:37,719 --> 00:38:39,280
This is not a familiar track.

674
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:41,940
They say Formula E

675
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,800
is just a technological testing ground
for manufacturers.

676
00:38:45,239 --> 00:38:46,320
There is no roaring sound,

677
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:48,860
but only the cold powertrain,

678
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:50,800
system software, inverters…

679
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,840
These parts are being innovated every year.

680
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:55,648
Here,

681
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:59,159
drivers don't seem as important

682
00:38:59,159 --> 00:39:00,352
as in Formula A or the Super Grand Prix.

683
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:03,239
It's hard to have a legend appear.

684
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:08,608
I know.

685
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:15,920
But this is not an unfamiliar field either.

686
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:18,459
For teams like ours,

687
00:39:18,459 --> 00:39:20,800
meeting Takano, meeting Markus.

688
00:39:22,239 --> 00:39:23,540
When all the technological competitions

689
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:25,000
reach their limits,

690
00:39:26,000 --> 00:39:28,039
we need drivers to create miracles even more.

691
00:39:30,944 --> 00:39:32,064
I know.

692
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,320
So I don't think

693
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,559
we should be afraid.

694
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,719
Let's go all out to create a new speed.

695
00:39:44,096 --> 00:39:45,184
Yes,

696
00:39:47,320 --> 00:39:48,352
definitely.

697
00:39:51,040 --> 00:39:57,536
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

698

The Super Formula E Grand Prix
is about to begin.

704
00:40:31,039 --> 00:40:32,800
The most eye-catching team is

705
00:40:33,440 --> 00:40:37,239
the Ruifeng Race Team from China.

706
00:40:43,960 --> 00:40:45,239
Drive well today.

707
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:47,040
Come on.

708
00:40:50,199 --> 00:40:52,220
Don't stress. Just do your normal performance.

709
00:40:52,220 --> 00:40:54,519
Miss Zhao, come have a drink.

710
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:59,159
Just do what you're supposed to do.

711
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:00,280
Deal.

712
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,020
Then I will continue to supervise everyone.

713
00:41:02,020 --> 00:41:03,280
Full speed ahead.

714
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:06,119
Look, a trophy.

715
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,480
Where? Where is it?

716
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:09,480
Where is the trophy?

717
00:41:09,480 --> 00:41:10,579
Look at that cloud.

718
00:41:10,579 --> 00:41:11,920
Doesn't it look like a trophy?

719
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,024
I think it looks like you.

720
00:41:16,079 --> 00:41:17,152
Enough. Enough.

721
00:41:17,152 --> 00:41:18,336
Guys,

722
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:20,416
are you ready?

723
00:41:21,039 --> 00:41:22,159
We're ready.

724
00:41:22,159 --> 00:41:23,840
What's our goal?

725
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,880
Champions.

00:42:39,504 --> 00:42:47,952
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

733
00:42:48,788 --> 00:42:52,784
♫ Fading away ♫

734
00:42:53,940 --> 00:43:00,432
♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫

735
00:43:00,432 --> 00:43:06,800
♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫

736
00:43:08,276 --> 00:43:15,152
♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫

737
00:43:15,152 --> 00:43:19,504
♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫

738
00:43:19,504 --> 00:43:25,872
♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫

739
00:43:25,872 --> 00:43:32,624
♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫

740
00:43:32,624 --> 00:43:39,952
♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫

741
00:43:39,952 --> 00:43:49,552
♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫
