Chen Mobai, you broke the rules. 
Why did you irritate him?

00:16:40,468 --> 00:16:45,220
Anyway, your not liking to speak isn't your fault.

181
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:49,940
Actually, sometimes, people don't necessarily 
have to express themselves with words.

182
00:16:49,940 --> 00:16:54,100
They can also use gestures or gazes.

183
00:16:55,159 --> 00:17:00,619
Okay, let me see why you brought me here today. 
What exactly do you want to say?

What to say?

although this Chen Mobai sometimes does not listen, you are

How about you? What do you want to say?

189
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,959
I want to say I understand now.

190
00:17:35,959 --> 00:17:39,020
I will use all my efforts

00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:42,559
to disperse this tiny bit of unhappiness Shen Xi has.

192
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,640
It will vanish with a bang.

- Your eyes can vocalize, huh? 
- Impressive, right?

194
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:03,559
I feel refreshed at the moment.

195
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:05,276
I'm in urgent need for training.

I hope my little pink pig
can bring you some luck.

for quite some time.

I give it to you today.

is meant to strengthen his endurance.

Drive the simulator blindfolded.

Let him practice the same corner
hundreds and thousands of times.

212
00:19:53,999 --> 00:19:55,400
As for the tortoise car,

213
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,919
he couldn't even last one round
at the beginning.

his handling of driving actions
has also become more precise.

It turns out that you're not
just about attacking.

223

When you're not attacking,
you observe your opponent.

Stuck on me, I can't shake it off.

358
00:29:37,559 --> 00:29:40,820
To be honest, I'm not very familiar
with the roads in China.

359
00:29:40,820 --> 00:29:42,752
You should drive.

360
00:29:51,820 --> 00:29:55,019
No, why is he letting me drive?

361
00:29:55,019 --> 00:29:56,380
What does he want to do?

362
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,840
No, I can't fall into his plan.

363
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:05,540
This is your car, you should drive.

364
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:07,724
There's navigation
if you're not familiar with the road.

365
00:30:09,599 --> 00:30:11,960
I don't mean anything else,
I just want to arrive early.

366
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:13,460
It doesn't matter
whether we arrive early or late.

367
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:16,260
The main thing is that it's my first time sitting in your car. I'm greatly honored, hurry.

368
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:18,508
Here you go.

369
00:30:18,508 --> 00:30:20,752
Don't argue anymore.

370
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,768
I'll drive.

371
00:30:24,680 --> 00:30:27,659
You two sit in the back, don't distract me.

372
00:31:48,599 --> 00:31:50,599
Is it the same as before?

373
00:31:50,599 --> 00:31:53,479
Suddenly remembering a lot of past things.

374
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:03,119
Always whispering​.

375
00:32:03,119 --> 00:32:05,260
There's another person here.

376
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:10,680
When I was in Germany, Shaoqian and my brother often
came to visit me at school.

377
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,340
We would go camping with the professor.

378
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,100
He was very caring for everyone back then.

379
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:16,008
It was really hard.

380
00:32:16,008 --> 00:32:18,640
Not hard, I really enjoyed it.

381
00:32:19,079 --> 00:32:21,019
Well, you enjoyed it.

382
00:32:21,019 --> 00:32:25,860
Speaking of Professor Breve, are you still using the method he taught you?

383
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,519
You mean the mass measurement method?

384
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:31,400
I've changed a lot of my habits now.

385
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:35,420
For instance, I place more emphasis
on experimental data curves.

386
00:32:35,420 --> 00:32:38,959
I'm not so obsessed
with the unity of theory and data anymore.

387
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:51,199
Sorry, once I start talking about specialized topics with Xi, we just can't stop.

388
00:32:51,900 --> 00:32:53,188
Let's not talk about that today.

389
00:32:53,188 --> 00:32:54,612
The grill is ready.

390
00:32:54,612 --> 00:32:56,480
Just need the fish now.

391
00:32:57,659 --> 00:32:59,684
Do you like fishing?

392
00:32:59,684 --> 00:33:01,920
Isn't that something old men do?

393
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:05,860
Shaoqian is actually quite good at fishing.

394
00:33:05,860 --> 00:33:08,819
No, it's just a hobby.

395
00:33:10,519 --> 00:33:13,659
Who doesn't know how to fish?
I know how to fish too.

396
00:33:13,659 --> 00:33:16,459
It's okay, we don't need that much.

397
00:33:16,459 --> 00:33:20,104
If you can't catch any, I'll share some with you.

398
00:33:21,359 --> 00:33:23,068
There's no need.

399
00:33:23,068 --> 00:33:26,259
We both eat based on our abilities. Shen Xi,

400
00:33:26,259 --> 00:33:28,160
I'll definitely catch a big one for you to eat.

401
00:33:28,160 --> 00:33:30,160
Bigger than his.

402
00:33:42,599 --> 00:33:45,299
Your fishing depends on skill and practice.

403
00:33:45,299 --> 00:33:49,559
My fish catching relies purely on talent.

404
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,160
Watch this.

405
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,300
He can catch fish?

406
00:33:53,300 --> 00:33:55,680
I thought he only knew how to drive.

407
00:33:59,860 --> 00:34:03,100
Is he always like this?

408
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,219
I hope he can catch something.

409
00:34:23,139 --> 00:34:25,188
I was just warming up.

410
00:35:15,440 --> 00:35:18,359
So good at fishing? Could he be Poseidon?

411
00:35:22,539 --> 00:35:25,480
Shen Xi, Shen Xi,

412
00:35:26,199 --> 00:35:28,679
can you come over here?
I have something to tell you.

413
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:30,980
I… I'll help Shaoqian first.

414
00:35:30,980 --> 00:35:35,040
Just come over here, it's urgent.

415
00:35:35,040 --> 00:35:38,088
- I will go over there.
- OK.

416
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:40,852
Be careful.

417
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:48,779
Why did you call me over?

418
00:35:50,779 --> 00:35:53,219
Help me catch fish.

419
00:35:53,219 --> 00:35:55,799
You've been helping him
with barbecuing and fishing.

420
00:35:55,799 --> 00:35:58,780
This net is broken, help me.

421
00:35:58,780 --> 00:36:00,440
How can I help you?

422
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:02,299
Help me fish.

423
00:36:02,299 --> 00:36:04,399
- Go into the water?
- Yes.

424
00:36:04,399 --> 00:36:06,340
How can I go in
when I am not prepared for anything?

425
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,599
No need to be prepared.
You just stay in the shallows.

426
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:09,119
I will drive the fish from the deeper part.

427
00:36:09,119 --> 00:36:10,840
You just catch them there.

428
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:02,259
I told Shen Xi to change her clothes.

429
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:09,839
There are so many fish.

430
00:37:10,540 --> 00:37:13,800
Alright, you are quite something today.

431
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:20,860
You are even more impressive.
You made her laugh.

432
00:37:27,748 --> 00:37:31,804
But you can't give her what I have.

433
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:36,460
There is such a thing?

434
00:37:36,460 --> 00:37:37,800
Fish?

435
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:41,140
Indeed, it's you who has secured
tonight's dinner.

436
00:37:43,639 --> 00:37:45,404
Chen Mobai,

437
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,580
you are a good racing driver.

438
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:52,900
You have talent, you have faith.

439
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:55,496
However,

440
00:37:55,496 --> 00:37:57,476
the endpoint of racing

441
00:37:57,960 --> 00:38:00,199
is farther than you think.

442
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,996
What do you mean by that?

443
00:38:06,039 --> 00:38:09,116
Do you really think you can reach

444
00:38:09,116 --> 00:38:11,619
the same endpoint as Xi?

445
00:38:15,539 --> 00:38:17,900
She doesn't belong here.

446
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,800
She is

447
00:38:21,239 --> 00:38:23,599
an angel with broken wings.

448
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:26,360
She is forced to stay on land.

449
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:30,340
In the end, she won't stay here.

450
00:38:30,840 --> 00:38:32,980
As soon as her wings heal,

451
00:38:34,239 --> 00:38:36,239
she will fly away.

452
00:38:37,259 --> 00:38:39,779
Back to where she belongs.

453
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:48,700
Although your Chinese is not bad,

454
00:38:48,700 --> 00:38:51,419
what you said

455
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,992
is quite sentimental.

456
00:38:57,960 --> 00:39:00,759
Thank you for taking the time
to let me understand you.

457
00:39:05,159 --> 00:39:08,059
We will meet again soon.

458
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:11,112
Thank you for the fish.

459
00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:16,139
But you'd better spend more time
thinking about yourself.

460
00:39:45,059 --> 00:39:47,280
She doesn't belong here.

461
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:49,960
She is

462
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,260
an angel with broken wings.

463
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:54,999
She is forced to stay on land.

464
00:39:54,999 --> 00:39:57,860
In the end, she won't stay here.

465
00:39:57,860 --> 00:40:01,360
As soon as her wings heal, she will fly away.

466
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,139
Back to where she belongs.

467
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,796
I will work hard to prove

468
00:40:07,796 --> 00:40:10,339
I am not her last resort.

469
00:40:11,360 --> 00:40:14,939
No matter how long the journey is,
no matter how distant the endpoint is,

470
00:40:14,939 --> 00:40:17,939
as long as our goals are in the same direction,

471
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:20,304
we are destined to travel together.

472
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,420
How about that?

473
00:40:50,420 --> 00:40:52,488
Not bad, right?

474
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:56,259
You came to train extra on your own.

475
00:40:57,079 --> 00:41:00,040
You've changed a lot recently.

476
00:41:06,459 --> 00:41:08,399
You may not understand me yet.

477
00:41:08,399 --> 00:41:13,540
Once I, Chen Mobai, decide to start a competition,

478
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:15,760
I have to win.

479
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,232
Competition?

480
00:41:18,232 --> 00:41:19,900
With whom?

481
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,099
With every opponent I meet on the racetrack,

482
00:41:24,099 --> 00:41:26,348
including Lin Shaoqian.

483
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,199
Everyone starts from different points.

484
00:41:31,199 --> 00:41:34,279
The places they want to go are also different.

485
00:41:37,939 --> 00:41:40,179
What if

486
00:41:41,159 --> 00:41:45,200
the place he wants to go
and the place I want to go are the same?

487
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,200
Are you talking about the Super Grand Prix?

488
00:41:56,019 --> 00:42:02,819
By that time, our team and I will develop
a faster and safer car.

489
00:42:02,819 --> 00:42:06,020
Because there will definitely be
a lot of people who set you as their final destination.

490
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:08,076
They won't let go easily,

491
00:42:08,076 --> 00:42:10,184
including Shaoqian.

492
00:42:11,139 --> 00:42:16,348
What I need to do is to make you
faster and more confident than before.

493
00:42:18,440 --> 00:42:20,488
So,

494
00:42:21,300 --> 00:42:24,080
you will always be with me, won't you?

495
00:42:25,519 --> 00:42:27,260
Of course.

496
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:34,092
♫ The rose leaves a fragrance ♫

497
00:42:34,092 --> 00:42:39,508
♫ The setting sun radiates light ♫

498
00:42:39,508 --> 00:42:45,072
♫ Your departure ♫

499
00:42:45,952 --> 00:42:49,784
♫ Only left a transparent wound ♫

500
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:57,272
♫ I keep falling ♫

501
00:42:57,272 --> 00:43:01,248
♫ Towards the direction you left ♫

502
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:06,708
♫ I'm embracing the fragments of memory ♫

503
00:43:06,708 --> 00:43:09,964
♫ I keep falling ♫

504
00:43:09,964 --> 00:43:17,216
♫ Holding our puzzle ♫

505
00:43:20,640 --> 00:43:26,020
♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫

506
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:33,044
♫ The heart gradually silences ♫

507
00:43:33,044 --> 00:43:39,712
♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫

508
00:43:39,712 --> 00:43:45,800
♫ I can't delete them ♫

509
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:51,772
♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫

510
00:43:51,772 --> 00:43:58,652
♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫

511
00:43:58,652 --> 00:44:07,900
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫

514
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:27,448
♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫

515
00:44:27,448 --> 00:44:34,300
♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫

516
00:44:34,300 --> 00:44:38,752
♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫

517
00:44:38,752 --> 00:44:45,120
♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫

518
00:44:45,120 --> 00:44:52,472
♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫

519
00:44:52,472 --> 00:44:59,100
♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫

520
00:44:59,100 --> 00:45:10,000
♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫
