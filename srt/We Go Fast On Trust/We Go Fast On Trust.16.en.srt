[We Go Fast on Trust]

14
00:01:36,128 --> 00:01:39,168
[Episode 16]

15
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:46,688
Sis,

16
00:01:48,319 --> 00:01:50,359
my class was prolonged again.

17
00:01:50,959 --> 00:01:52,079
No worries.

18
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,380
I heard from Aunt that you've finally
proven your innocence

19
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:56,680
and that you're going back
to Markus. That's good.

20
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:05,359
Does Chen Mobai not want you to leave?

21
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:10,159
No, he didn't say that.

22
00:02:11,439 --> 00:02:14,199
So, do you not want to go back to Markus?

23
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,904
Is it that?

24
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,759
Then why do you still look so worried?

25
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:30,479
Maybe I feel a bit down
for losing the competition.

26
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:37,920
A game loss wouldn't make you feel like this

27
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:40,280
unless you think
that you are the reason he lost.

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:48,680
You can't hide any
emotional issues from my keen eye.

29
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:53,420
When two people start to get along,

30
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:55,800
there will surely be problems.

31
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,840
In our relationship,

32
00:03:05,479 --> 00:03:07,919
indeed, there seems to be a certain paradox.

33
00:03:11,639 --> 00:03:12,800
We both care about each other a lot,

34
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:16,239
which is exactly the reason

35
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:18,439
why we've become hesitant and restricted.

36
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:27,159
What kind of logic is this?

37
00:03:36,759 --> 00:03:39,479
Having feelings for someone
will naturally make you vulnerable.

38
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,620
If you want to resolve this,
you can use your subjective initiative.

39
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,879
Subjective initiative?

40
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:49,248
For example,

41
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,700
last time I wanted to invite Yuan Ye

42
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,960
to watch Chen Mobai's competition.

43
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,520
So I made a bet with myself.

44
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,860
I wagered on whether I would hit a wrong note

45
00:04:00,860 --> 00:04:02,039
in the next piano competition.

46
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,776
If I do,

47
00:04:04,599 --> 00:04:05,664
then forget it.

48
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,479
But if I play it right,

49
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:10,319
no matter whether he rejects me or not,

50
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,000
I will take the initiative to ask him out.

51
00:04:15,759 --> 00:04:16,864
And then?

52
00:04:17,399 --> 00:04:20,060
Then, to play every note right,

53
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:22,020
I played it for like hundreds of times.

54
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:24,040
I almost wore out my fingernails.

55
00:04:27,439 --> 00:04:29,840
So when you care about someone,

56
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:32,040
it's impossible for you
to not be affected by that at all.

57
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,080
But you need to see

58
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,000
if that influence is positive.

59
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,220
If after your efforts,

60
00:04:39,220 --> 00:04:41,820
both of you can develop in a good direction,

61
00:04:41,820 --> 00:04:43,120
then there is no problem.

62
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:50,680
I must find a solution.

63
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,759
Otherwise, we will be stuck in place.

64
00:04:54,879 --> 00:04:56,079
No matter how hard we hit the gas pedal,

65
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:58,279
we may not be able to move forward anymore.

66
00:05:14,519 --> 00:05:15,584
So what are you really thinking?

67
00:05:16,399 --> 00:05:17,800
Do you also accept this paradox

68
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,860
and think it's unsolvable?

69
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:20,920
Of course not.

70
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:25,728
Although theoretically,

71
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,759
I don't understand as much as she does,

72
00:05:31,319 --> 00:05:32,480
I know what to do.

73
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,480
So have you decided what to do?

74
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,680
Starting with Linhai,

75
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:40,256
I have to win

76
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:42,839
the upcoming competitions.

77
00:05:44,439 --> 00:05:45,472
I'm going to prove to her

78
00:05:47,519 --> 00:05:48,600
that the paradox doesn't exist.

79
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:55,040
Actually,

80
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,480
everything you just said

81
00:05:58,040 --> 00:05:59,439
is all judging what's best for her

82
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:02,199
from your perspective.

83
00:06:05,079 --> 00:06:08,160
You two are both the kind of people

84
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:09,839
who prefer to take ten actions for each other

85
00:06:09,839 --> 00:06:11,160
rather than say one word.

86
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,240
All right, it's getting late.

87
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,216
Get some rest.

88
00:07:00,068 --> 00:07:03,904
[For you, I made a bet with myself]

89
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,079
With this new model,

90
00:07:09,079 --> 00:07:10,336
as long as the issue of the airfoil

91
00:07:10,336 --> 00:07:12,279
and aerodynamic characteristics are cleared,

92
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:13,800
I can make a breakthrough.

93
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:37,216
You're up.

94
00:07:39,399 --> 00:07:40,839
I'm taking you somewhere.

95
00:07:40,839 --> 00:07:41,879
Where are we going?

96
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:42,976
You'll know once we're there.

97
00:08:10,176 --> 00:08:11,264
How about it?

98
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,879
Does it feel like a hidden Arcadia?

99
00:08:16,079 --> 00:08:18,160
This is a beautiful place.

100
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,679
In theory, it's hard to simulate
steady wind in the outdoors,

101
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,639
but here I can see the wind.

102
00:08:47,879 --> 00:08:50,279
It's flowing and changing.

103
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:03,744
How's it going?

104
00:09:04,639 --> 00:09:06,399
I don't have a perfect solution yet,

105
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:09,720
but I've got a rough idea.

106
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:13,919
If you have got a rough idea,

107
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,639
can I make a little request?

108
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:17,639
What request?

109
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,480
I brought you here today to relax,

110
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,960
so I'm confiscating this notebook for now.

111
00:09:26,279 --> 00:09:27,500
Wipe out all the programs

112
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,919
that have been taking up your memory recently.

113
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:34,279
Give the brain that's been
running for too long a break,

114
00:09:34,879 --> 00:09:35,968
all right?

115
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:42,784
♫ Fragrance of rose ♫

116
00:09:42,784 --> 00:09:47,744
♫ Sunset light ♫

117
00:09:48,288 --> 00:09:52,512
♫ Your departure ♫

118
00:09:55,396 --> 00:09:58,208
♫But it only left a transparent wound♫

119
00:10:02,884 --> 00:10:06,176
♫ I fall ♫

120
00:10:06,176 --> 00:10:10,048
♫ Towards the direction you left ♫

121
00:10:10,048 --> 00:10:12,768
♫ I embrace the fragments of memory ♫

122
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,900
Just wait and see.

123
00:10:16,900 --> 00:10:19,220
As long as Dr. Shen
and Mobai give it their all,

124
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:21,200
we will turn the tables in this game.

125
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:23,120
Can this solve their paradox?

126
00:10:23,679 --> 00:10:25,000
Why are you still talking about that paradox?

127
00:10:27,879 --> 00:10:29,200
I'm just thinking about what's best for them.

128
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,159
I've said it earlier.

129
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,240
The fundamental problem with them
is that they're not suitable for each other.

130
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:36,320
If they insist on being together,

131
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,639
it would be troublesome for both of them.

132
00:10:39,399 --> 00:10:41,479
Even if you're right about that,

133
00:10:41,479 --> 00:10:44,399
Chen Mobai is truly worried
about Shen Xi's doubts.

134
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,360
Putting aside the fact
that I'm the team manager,

135
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:48,820
and from the position of a friend,

136
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:51,320
doesn't this clearly prove
that they care about each other

137
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:52,919
and like each other?

138
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,800
As long as there's love,
no difficulty is insurmountable.

139
00:10:57,720 --> 00:10:59,760
Since there are so many
difficulties to overcome,

140
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,799
why be together?

141
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:02,656
Isn't it tiring?

142
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:05,360
That's normal people's romantic relationships.

143
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,520
It's mundane. Mundane as can be.

144
00:11:09,520 --> 00:11:12,159
It might be, but that's love.

145
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,719
Let me tell you about the bliss
of us mundane people,

146
00:11:20,719 --> 00:11:22,279
which is,

147
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:24,320
when a couple both like spicy food,

148
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,039
they would order a mouth-numbing,
spicy boiled fish with pickles in a restaurant.

149
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:28,928
And on a Tuesday,

150
00:11:29,799 --> 00:11:32,360
we buy discounted movie tickets.

151
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,080
Also, if you piss me off today,

152
00:11:35,080 --> 00:11:36,860
regardless of the passing crowds around,

153
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,560
I will still argue with you,

154
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,679
without fearing you'd leave me over it.

155
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,559
And when you know I was in a queue

156
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:48,360
for three hours to buy this ice cream,

157
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,440
you would enjoy it more.

158
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:57,632
Zhao Yingning,

159
00:12:01,840 --> 00:12:02,879
I like you.

160
00:12:06,039 --> 00:12:07,080
Will you marry me?

161
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:13,219
Why don't you try to let yourself go
in public once in a while?

162
00:12:13,219 --> 00:12:14,304
It's exhilarating.

163
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,480
If you don't say yes, I won't get up.

164
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,280
Are you crazy?

165
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:27,456
Good job, beauty!

166
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,879
Why are you walking so fast?

167
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,960
I was just joking with you.

168
00:12:34,559 --> 00:12:35,799
How was it?

169
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:38,759
Wasn't it exhilarating to be impulsive

170
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:40,512
once in a while?

171
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,300
Then, how about I take you to try

172
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:49,720
a mouth-numbing, spicy boiled fish

173
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,799
and let you experience
the bliss of ordinary people?

174
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,384
It's so beautiful.

175
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,759
In the city, we can't see the stars.

176
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:05,879
The stars are so far away from us.

177
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,960
Their light was emitted
tens of thousands of years ago.

178
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:13,696
Tens of thousands of years?

179
00:13:15,679 --> 00:13:18,320
Does it take that long for a beam of light
to reach Earth?

180
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:21,639
To emit light and to be seen

181
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:24,080
might be the dream of a star.

182
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:26,679
Now that we've seen it,

183
00:13:27,480 --> 00:13:28,799
its dream has come true.

184
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,360
Dreams feel so distant.

185
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:39,879
What about you, what's your dream?

186
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:44,679
To be a top-tier engineer?

187
00:14:00,799 --> 00:14:03,039
I didn't seem to have any dreams as a child.

188
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,376
Instead, my older brother

189
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,159
had a clear goal.

190
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,848
He wanted to get into Formula B, and Formula A,

191
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,919
up to the Super Grand Prix.

192
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,600
I guess I just followed his path

193
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,159
and ended up here today.

194
00:14:23,159 --> 00:14:25,000
I still remember the first time I saw him race.

195
00:14:25,879 --> 00:14:26,912
I was so curious.

196
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:29,399
Why was the Aerodynamics kit so complicated,

197
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:32,360
and why did the rear diffuser
have to be made so large?

198
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,200
So I studied a bit,

199
00:14:37,159 --> 00:14:38,208
and then,

200
00:14:39,679 --> 00:14:41,519
I got into TU Germany

201
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,200
before I joined Markus.

202
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,639
I feel like I've heard
the story of a genius girl.

203
00:14:54,039 --> 00:14:55,136
Not really.

204
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,200
It sounded easy,

205
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,519
but there had been many years in between.

206
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:06,600
What happened later?

207
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:10,320
Later, I found out

208
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:15,279
that racing seems to be more
than just a sports event,

209
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,840
but an industry chain,

210
00:15:19,679 --> 00:15:21,679
a high-tech industry.

211
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:25,519
The West has been ahead of us
by many, many years,

212
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,440
and it's very difficult to get
into the core of this circle.

213
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,440
For a girl to live
in such a hardcore environment,

214
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,600
to challenge, and to strive,

215
00:15:41,399 --> 00:15:42,464
it must be very hard, right?

216
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:46,784
Not really.

217
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,120
The environment is fair after all.

218
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,039
They've been ahead of us for so many years,

219
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,759
so we just have to adapt and learn first.

220
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,024
I still remember

221
00:16:06,039 --> 00:16:08,600
the day Wings of Wind was developed.

222
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,344
My brother and I,

223
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,264
and Shaoqian…

224
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:29,719
Girl, now I can finally say,

225
00:16:29,719 --> 00:16:31,279
the dream is right ahead of us.

226
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:34,799
I believe that in the near future,

227
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,960
be it engineers

228
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:38,720
or racing drivers,

229
00:16:39,679 --> 00:16:41,320
none of us will remain an anomaly.

230
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:47,519
Actually, the Super Grand Prix

231
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,440
is where you belong.

232
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,360
I will go back,

233
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,159
but not alone.

234
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,960
It will be you and I,

235
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,519
along with our entire team.

236
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,840
This is my current dream.

237
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:08,680
Although I don't know

238
00:17:09,519 --> 00:17:11,839
how far off the day my brother mentioned is,

239
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,620
and we may still have to go through

240
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:18,980
more technical difficulties
and psychological challenges,

241
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,319
I look forward to the day

242
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:24,359
when the Super Grand Prix
changes because of us.

243
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,248
It will.

244
00:17:33,664 --> 00:17:34,759
You will surely become

245
00:17:34,759 --> 00:17:35,920

246
00:17:37,160 --> 00:17:38,319
Your dream will surely come true.

247
00:17:39,839 --> 00:17:41,799
Our dream will also come true.

248
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,152
I've always believed

249
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,240
that as long as we are together,

250
00:17:48,079 --> 00:17:49,519
there are no hurdles we can't overcome.

251
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,680
There is no end we can't reach.

252
00:17:54,279 --> 00:17:55,296
It's been this way,

253
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:57,920
and it always will be.

Xu Gong, where's Shen Xi?

261
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:25,536
Why hasn't she arrived yet?

262
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,464
Not yet? It's strange that she
hasn't shown up at this point.

263
00:19:35,960 --> 00:19:38,656
Be careful. Just put it down here.

264
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:42,880
Easy.

265
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:45,472
Thank you.

266
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:48,680
The technology center has finally
made the new part.

267
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:51,039
You've been hiding this secret for too long.

268
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,439
I've been working on this plan

269
00:19:53,439 --> 00:19:54,559
and only now has it matured.

270
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,320
Take a look.

271
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,400
A new rear wing.

272
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:07,979
You can see it as I am using

273
00:20:07,979 --> 00:20:10,960
the power of wind
to increase the car's lap speed.

274
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:14,120
Each Formula A team has its unique technology.

275
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,280
Junda has brakes.

276
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,240
Takano has high-performance power units.

277
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,680
Our past performances weren't satisfactory

278
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,920
largely because

279
00:20:20,920 --> 00:20:23,240
we didn't have our unique technology.

280
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,680
So I thought I'd do some upgrades
on the Aerodynamics kit.

281
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:30,920
The problem with traditional wings
is that they are fixed

282
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:34,240
so their aerodynamic characteristics
cannot be changed.

283
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:36,580
Either they have a large angle
and are fast in the turns,

284
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:38,419
or they have a small angle
and are fast in the straight track.

285
00:20:38,419 --> 00:20:39,860
We can only choose one of the two.

286
00:20:39,860 --> 00:20:42,740
But if we have suitable materials
and an appropriate design,

287
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:44,119
we can create a rear wing

288
00:20:44,119 --> 00:20:46,260
that becomes deformed by wind direction

289
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,079
at a speed of 250 kilometers per hour,

290
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:50,840
guaranteeing the downforce in turns

291
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,440
while the speed in the straight track
can further increase.

292
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,600
So how much can my tail speed increase?

293
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,240
Theoretically,

294
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:03,540
the maximum speed will be
270 kilometers per hour.

295
00:21:03,540 --> 00:21:05,640
- That's a lot!
- 270?!

296
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,480
This isn't…

297
00:21:08,359 --> 00:21:09,880
four words.

298
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,000
Keep pressing and winning.

299
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,064
It's more like…

300
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:14,860
- Here.
- Turning the corner and winning.

301
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,119
Yes.

302
00:21:16,119 --> 00:21:17,400
Impressive.

303
00:21:20,839 --> 00:21:21,856
However,

304
00:21:22,599 --> 00:21:23,759
if the wind conditions are inappropriate,

305
00:21:24,519 --> 00:21:26,400
airflow separation may occur
on the surface of the Aerodynamics kit,

306
00:21:26,920 --> 00:21:28,599
making the vehicle out of control
due to loss of downforce

307
00:21:29,359 --> 00:21:31,920
or making the driver lose control of the car.

308
00:21:32,720 --> 00:21:36,000
So the driver must cooperate very closely

309
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:37,480
with the engineer.

310
00:21:39,839 --> 00:21:42,319
You decide the best time to use it in the race.

311
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:44,064
That's right.

312
00:21:44,896 --> 00:21:45,984
Chen Mobai.

313
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:49,344
Can you achieve the cooperation I mentioned?

314
00:21:52,736 --> 00:21:53,740
I can.

315
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:54,920
Of course, he can!

316
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,939
Right?

317
00:21:56,939 --> 00:21:58,920
Although I didn't understand much,
I'm very impressed

318
00:22:01,119 --> 00:22:03,200
Ok, Xu Gong, it's up to you now.

319
00:22:03,759 --> 00:22:04,780
Leave it to me.

Let's go to technical training.

323
00:22:29,359 --> 00:22:30,659
Chen Mobai came in second.

324
00:22:30,659 --> 00:22:32,920
He did quite well in this qualifying race,

325
00:22:33,759 --> 00:22:36,680
but that Mitsui is so good at corners.

326
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,400
He still took pole position from him.

327
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:41,239
You even know what pole position means now,

328
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:42,400
getting all professional.

329
00:22:43,559 --> 00:22:45,359
Thanks to your good teaching, Senior.

330
00:22:47,759 --> 00:22:49,359
They ran to the finish line of the race,

331
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:51,640
but you ran into my heart.

332
00:22:55,480 --> 00:22:56,839
Will we be able to see Chen Mobai in a bit?

333
00:22:58,160 --> 00:22:59,640
I guess so.

334
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,440
We can go catch him later.

what a workaholic.

338
00:23:43,599 --> 00:23:44,839
You don't have to do these things.

339
00:23:46,279 --> 00:23:48,400
I want to personally clean
the car you're racing in.

340
00:23:51,839 --> 00:23:52,864
What's the story?

341
00:23:53,880 --> 00:23:56,800
Will an engineer cleaning a car
produce a champion?

342
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:00,199
I'm being nice to it

343
00:24:00,199 --> 00:24:02,079
because I want it to take you home safely.

347
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,559
I also have things to tell you.

348
00:24:39,680 --> 00:24:40,720
But for today's race,

349
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:43,072
don't think about anything else.

350
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:46,119
Just focus on the game,

351
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:47,808
okay?

352
00:24:53,759 --> 00:24:54,848
I promise.

My name is Wang Duobao.

361
00:25:22,319 --> 00:25:23,559
I wanted to sponsor you before

362
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:25,279
but you rejected me.

363
00:25:25,839 --> 00:25:26,839
I'm the boss of a tractor factory.

364
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,008
Remember?

365
00:25:31,552 --> 00:25:32,579
I'm your fan.

366
00:25:32,579 --> 00:25:33,664
I've liked you for a long time.

367
00:25:34,240 --> 00:25:35,400
Can you take a photo with me?

368
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,640
Sure.

369
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:39,080
Thank you. Look, look at this.

370
00:25:39,080 --> 00:25:40,319
I prepared it for you.

371
00:25:40,319 --> 00:25:41,792
[Go Chen Mobai]
Here, can you hold it?

372
00:25:42,359 --> 00:25:45,079
Okay. Three, two, one. Cheese.

373
00:25:46,599 --> 00:25:47,599
Thank you so much.

374
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:49,248
Thank you.

375
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,712
Miss Engineer.

376
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:53,408
Miss.

377
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:55,880
You two should take a photo.

378
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,799
Come on, I'll take one for you.

379
00:25:59,160 --> 00:26:00,640
Let's take one.

380
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:01,728
Come on.

381
00:26:02,319 --> 00:26:03,440
Here we go.

382
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:04,599
Three, two.

383
00:26:05,559 --> 00:26:06,560
What are you doing?

384
00:26:07,319 --> 00:26:08,319
You look awkward.

385
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:10,336
Right?

386
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,279
That's right. Here we go.

387
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:23,279
Come on. Three, two, one.

388
00:26:27,488 --> 00:26:28,559
That's great. It was nice.

389
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:29,559
I'll send it to Manager Hao later.

390
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:31,559
- I'll leave now.
- Okay.

391
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,472
Good luck!

392

[Go Chen Mobai]
Duobao tractors, made in China.

393
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,160
Good luck.

394
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:46,279
Right, Miss, he likes you.

395
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:06,368
Anyway…

396
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,512
There's still some time.

397
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:12,940
You might want to go back
to the lounge and get some rest.

398
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:16,064
Okay, then.

399
00:27:18,119 --> 00:27:19,168
See you in the afternoon.

400
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,728
See you in the afternoon.

401
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:03,776
Do you have some time to talk?

402
00:28:12,839 --> 00:28:14,519
I'm not one to beat around the bush.

403
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:16,416
Just cut to the chase.

404
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:20,000
I want to make things clear

405
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,664
about why I came to Takano and Junda.

406
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:25,984
It's because of you.

407
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:28,512
I want to see how capable you are

408
00:28:29,599 --> 00:28:31,119
and whether you're good enough for her.

409
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,119
You're quite frank,

410
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,416
but thank you anyway.

411
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:46,519
My relationship with Shen Xi
is none of your business.

412
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:48,640
I don't mean to interfere.

413
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,640
I just hope you can understand who Xi is.

414
00:28:58,119 --> 00:28:59,168
You might know

415
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:03,160
Shen Xi is a double Ph.D.
in mechanical engineering and fluidics

416
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,312
but

417
00:29:06,119 --> 00:29:08,240
you don't understand that someone like her

418
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,119
only appears once in decades.

419
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:13,984
When she was in school,

420
00:29:14,519 --> 00:29:15,616
she led the team

421
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:19,160
and won the world championship
of the College Student Formula.

422
00:29:21,319 --> 00:29:22,319
Then she joined Markus

423
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:27,008
and became the only Chinese

424
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,079
female engineer on the super race track.

425
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:31,240
Do you know what that means?

426
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,319
It means she's excellent.

427
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:40,400
Since the excellent her chose me,

428
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:43,520
I'm not so bad either.

429
00:29:49,039 --> 00:29:50,112
I like your confidence

430
00:29:51,519 --> 00:29:52,608
and I appreciate your abilities.

431
00:29:53,599 --> 00:29:55,160
But even for someone like Shen Chuan,

432
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:57,344
it took a long time

433
00:29:58,279 --> 00:29:59,296
to enter the Super Grand Prix.

434
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:01,024
How about you?

435
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,552
How long do you need?

436
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:08,359
Do you want Xi to wait for you on the spot?

437
00:30:12,559 --> 00:30:13,680
She is a fish that belongs in the sea,

438
00:30:14,559 --> 00:30:15,759
and you shouldn't let her

439
00:30:16,359 --> 00:30:19,168
stay in the pond for you.

440
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:26,519
Your dream will surely come true.

441
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:29,720
Our dream will also come true.

442
00:30:31,808 --> 00:30:32,864
I always believe

443
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:34,839
that as long as we are together,

444
00:30:35,640 --> 00:30:37,039
there are no hurdles we can't overcome.

445
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:40,279
There is no end we can't reach.

446
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,264
It's been this way,

447
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,824
and it always will be.

448
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:54,000
How do you know I am not that sea?

449
00:30:57,000 --> 00:30:58,080
Lin Shaoqian.

450
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:00,608
You said

451
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:03,839
that a racer needs to let
his engine do the talking.

452
00:31:05,759 --> 00:31:06,784
And today,

453
00:31:08,319 --> 00:31:09,559
I will let you listen well

454
00:31:11,400 --> 00:31:13,119
to the engine that belongs to me.

455
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:36,860
Cheng, I don't understand why

456
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:38,340
Weishi continues to invest

457
00:31:38,340 --> 00:31:40,780
when the Ruifeng Group's financial statements

458
00:31:40,780 --> 00:31:43,159
are already so bad. Have you forgotten

459
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:45,000
about the agreement between us?

460
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,279
Let me tell you something. If you lose,
you have to bear the money.

461
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,200
Of course, I haven't forgotten.

462
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,640
In this meeting, we just want
to explain to you face to face.

463
00:31:57,200 --> 00:32:00,519
I don't think that any
explanation can satisfy me.

464
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:03,008
Please.

465
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:12,680
Are you sure you want to do this?

466
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,000
I thought we agreed to take a gamble.

467
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,072
Hello, everyone.

468
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:23,240
Today we will not only make an explanation
to Yellow Stone,

469
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:25,400
but we also make an invitation.

470
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:28,059
We hope Yellow Stone can join Weishi

471
00:32:28,059 --> 00:32:29,359
in co-investing Ruifeng.

472
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:36,000
Zhao, I've always liked your sense of humor.

473
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:39,200
But remember, in a hard time,

474
00:32:39,200 --> 00:32:41,559
any jokes cannot make the situation better.

475
00:32:42,599 --> 00:32:44,480
Why don't you watch a race with us first?

476
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,620
The Formula A Championship in Linhai Stop

477
00:32:48,620 --> 00:32:50,039
is about to start.

478
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:52,059
We can see that the audience

479
00:32:52,059 --> 00:32:53,520
is taking their seats one after another.

480
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,700
Various teams have begun
their preparations in full swing.

481
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:59,040
Watch the game? Are you kidding me?

482
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:01,360
We have only one day. It's today.

483
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,880
Tomorrow morning, we need to leave.

484
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,104
So why do we need to waste
our time to watch the game?

485
00:33:07,104 --> 00:33:08,192
Tell me.

486
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:10,160
Mr. Grasso,

487
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:12,440
you have attended so many business meetings.

488
00:33:13,720 --> 00:33:15,780
You know that those beautiful words

489
00:33:15,780 --> 00:33:17,480
and fancy presentations

490
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:19,380
are really a waste of time.

491
00:33:19,380 --> 00:33:20,704
That's right.

492
00:33:20,704 --> 00:33:23,199
Mr. Grasso, don't you want to know

493
00:33:23,199 --> 00:33:25,119
what makes them still trust Ruifeng

494
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,799
and what is the bottom line
that we dare to propose

495
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,888
co-investment?

496
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:31,744
I promise.

497
00:33:32,359 --> 00:33:33,799
We just need half an hour.

498
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:36,680
You will have a satisfactory answer.

499
00:33:38,519 --> 00:33:39,584
Mr. Grasso,

500
00:33:40,160 --> 00:33:41,599
we Chinese say,

501
00:33:42,279 --> 00:33:44,559
as we come, so be it.

502
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:46,519
Let's just take a look.

503
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:53,824
You have a big nerve.

504
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:56,440
Mobai has to win the championship today

505
00:33:58,119 --> 00:33:59,440
to satisfy him.

506
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:01,799
Since we decided to take a gamble,

507
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:03,640
let's go all in.

508
00:34:05,319 --> 00:34:06,940
If he can't win the championship,

509
00:34:06,940 --> 00:34:07,960
Maituo won't live long anyway.

510
00:34:09,159 --> 00:34:11,199
I hope we can have a great victory.

511
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:15,199
Working with you needs a strong heart.

512
00:34:19,639 --> 00:34:22,079
Did you rearrange the car
based on the data given yesterday?

513
00:34:22,599 --> 00:34:23,616
Yes, it's all set.

514
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,740
The track temperature is quite high today.

515
00:34:30,740 --> 00:34:32,920
- Remember to check the tire pressure.
- Okay.

516
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:35,000
Make sure all the sensors are working properly.

517
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:55,424
Keep an eye on the weather radar,
and prepare for a wet race.

518
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,536
Wang, is this all set?

519
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,599
Ready to race, all the numbers match.

520
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:47,392
Hello?

521
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:53,824
Junda.

522
00:35:55,760 --> 00:35:57,179
There are five minutes left for the countdown.

523
00:35:57,179 --> 00:35:58,659
Most of the race cars

524
00:35:58,659 --> 00:36:00,800
have completed their checks and adjustments.

525
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,320
They've reached the starting line.

526
00:36:21,239 --> 00:36:22,760
Why isn't Mobai here yet?
There are only five minutes left.

527
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:26,760
Xu Gong, Monkey, go look for him.

528
00:36:32,096 --> 00:36:33,119
Chen Mobai.

529
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:34,304
Mobai.

530
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,096
What took you so long?

531
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:38,880
Chen Mobai.

532
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:43,440
No matter what happened,

533
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,599
stay calm now.

534
00:36:55,719 --> 00:36:56,800
Don't worry.

535
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:01,120
Wait for me.

536
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,579
Starting from the pole position,

537
00:37:48,579 --> 00:37:51,260
Mitsui Taku is very calm at this moment.

538
00:37:51,260 --> 00:37:54,379
the "King of Asian Racing" seems
to have won on the starting line

539
00:37:54,379 --> 00:37:56,719
and ready to continue dominating the track.

540
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:59,740
We can see trailing behind him

541
00:37:59,740 --> 00:38:00,880
to start the race

542
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,719
is Chen Mobai who stumbled
in the first two rounds.

543
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:08,040
From my observation,
he's looking quite good today.

544
00:38:08,040 --> 00:38:11,520
After Shen Chuan, no Chinese person
has won a Formula A race champion

545
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,320
even for a single stop.

546
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,460
Let's wait and see
if the king of Formula B races

547
00:38:17,460 --> 00:38:20,199
can create a miracle in Formula A.

548
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,816
The third driver is also

549
00:38:22,816 --> 00:38:24,420
a Formula B racer, Lu Yunhao.

550
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,179
The Junda team's investment in racing

551
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:28,960
is obvious to all.

552
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:29,980
Nakamura Kanji.

553
00:38:29,980 --> 00:38:31,119
Yes.

554
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:32,639
I hope you have arranged everything.

555
00:38:33,360 --> 00:38:34,432
Don't worry, Mr. President.

556
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:37,500
The chief referee of this race

557
00:38:37,500 --> 00:38:40,120
is an important figure
in the Asian racing world

558
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:42,320
and also my old friend.

559
00:38:43,519 --> 00:38:45,079
We are from the same place.

560
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:49,320
That's great.

561
00:38:50,519 --> 00:38:53,719
It seems that getting rid of
this new troublemaker

562
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,700
aligns with their interests.

563
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:58,239
Yes, you're right.

564
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:01,960
Look.

565
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:02,976
Yes.

566
00:39:05,119 --> 00:39:06,420
Dear audience and all the racing fans,

567
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:08,219
what you are seeing now

568
00:39:08,219 --> 00:39:10,680
is the live broadcast of this season's

569
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,079
Asian Formula A Championship
in its third stop, Linhai.

570
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,939
All the cars have been positioned
in the starting area.

571
00:39:14,939 --> 00:39:17,540
The pole position belongs
to Mitsui Taku of the Takano Team.

572
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:20,280
Behind him is Chen Mobai from Ruifeng Race Team

573
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:22,580
and Lu Yunhao from the Junda Team.

574
00:39:22,580 --> 00:39:25,300
I believe they will definitely put on

575
00:39:25,300 --> 00:39:26,960
an exciting competition for us today.

576
00:39:29,184 --> 00:39:30,219
The race begins.

577
00:39:30,219 --> 00:39:33,020
Mitsui Taku takes the lead
and maintains his advantage.

578
00:39:33,020 --> 00:39:35,680
Everyone else has also adopted
an aggressive strategy from the start.

579
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:38,100
The competition is getting intense
right out of the gate.

580
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:40,300
The third place, Lu Yunhao,
has an astonishing posture.

581
00:39:40,300 --> 00:39:41,880
He's going head-to-head with his old rival,

582
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:43,199
Chen Mobai, right after the start.

583
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:45,940
Taking advantage of Junda's
excellent braking system,

584
00:39:45,940 --> 00:39:49,400
Lu Yunhao launched an attack
at the third corner with late braking

585
00:39:50,039 --> 00:39:53,152
and Chen Mobai might have been restricted
before his car even warmed up.

586
00:39:53,679 --> 00:39:55,899
It seems from the last race at Changlu,

587
00:39:55,899 --> 00:39:59,280
Snatching the runner-up from Chen Mobai
at the last moment

588
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,239
gave Lu Yunhao a great deal of confidence.

589
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:04,899
Besides, he's too familiar with Chen Mobai.

590
00:40:04,899 --> 00:40:07,079
No need to test the waters.
He attacks immediately.

591
00:40:07,719 --> 00:40:08,860
We can see that Lu Yunhao

592
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:10,440
is being quite aggressive today.

593
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:13,859
It seems he is constantly provoking Chen Mobai.

594
00:40:13,859 --> 00:40:16,679
Let's see how Chen Mobai will respond.

595
00:40:17,719 --> 00:40:18,816
What's happening to Mobai?

596
00:40:20,519 --> 00:40:22,280
Chen Mobai, don't let them distract you.

597
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,360
Stick to our tactics.

598
00:40:24,639 --> 00:40:26,000
They wanted to provoke me before.

599
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,480
Don't worry, I have it under control.

600
00:40:32,448 --> 00:40:33,540
What's going on?

601
00:40:33,540 --> 00:40:35,940
Chen Mobai is being a bit conservative today,

602
00:40:35,940 --> 00:40:38,260
letting Lu Yunhao overtake him so easily.

603
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,860
Now Lu Yunhao is in second place,

604
00:40:39,860 --> 00:40:41,519
and Chen Mobai has fallen to the third.

605
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,000
The driver from the Philippines
in fourth place,

606
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:45,619
Chami also surpassed Chen Mobai.

607
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:47,104
The spirited Chen Mobai

608
00:40:47,104 --> 00:40:48,500
from Formula B track is nowhere to be seen.

609
00:40:48,500 --> 00:40:49,780
He's become overly cautious.

610
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,760
Don't worry, the devil is still the devil.

611
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:55,280
And a brand new one.

612
00:40:57,079 --> 00:40:59,904
This time, we'll win together.

613
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:04,512
Your team's technicians said

614
00:41:05,039 --> 00:41:06,360
you locked Chen Mobai in the dressing room

615
00:41:08,039 --> 00:41:09,239
and almost made him miss the race.

616
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:12,639
Who can't keep their mouth shut?

617
00:41:14,039 --> 00:41:15,379
Chen Mobai had a lousy mouth.

618
00:41:15,379 --> 00:41:16,880
Racing isn't a joke.

619
00:41:19,840 --> 00:41:23,079
Remember, suppressing your opponent
on the track is a skill,

620
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:25,760
and provocation off the track

621
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:27,968
is incompetence.

622
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:30,848
I don't want

623
00:41:31,760 --> 00:41:33,280
people like you in the team I coach.

624
00:41:37,800 --> 00:41:38,848
I'm sorry.

625
00:41:40,119 --> 00:41:41,152
It won't happen again.

626
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:44,119
I'll go back to work.

627
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:54,848
Mr. Lin.

628
00:41:58,559 --> 00:41:59,616
What he did

629
00:42:00,159 --> 00:42:02,368
will never happen again. I promise.

630
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,096
I apologize for him.

631
00:42:07,679 --> 00:42:10,320
Please continue leading us towards the podium.

632
00:42:19,360 --> 00:42:21,100
Mobai, the tire temperature is ideal.

633
00:42:21,100 --> 00:42:22,400
You can show them what you've got now.

634
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:23,480
Understood.

635
00:42:23,480 --> 00:42:25,880
The ranking hasn't changed
halfway through the race.

636
00:42:25,880 --> 00:42:27,040
Things seem to be a bit dull.

637
00:42:27,040 --> 00:42:28,519
The distance between the top three is so close.

638
00:42:28,519 --> 00:42:29,920
The chances of overtaking them
are pretty low, right?

639
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,552
It's the seventh turn ahead.

640
00:42:32,280 --> 00:42:34,159
We need to slow down for the second-gear turn.

641
00:42:36,239 --> 00:42:37,920
Chen Mobai, during the seventh turn,

642
00:42:38,559 --> 00:42:41,039
overtake Chami directly
and don't downshift to second gear.

643
00:42:41,039 --> 00:42:43,540
The turn is quite acute.
Going into it in third gear,

644
00:42:43,540 --> 00:42:44,960
won't it throw him off the track?

645
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:47,199
Chen Mobai.

646
00:42:47,199 --> 00:42:48,400
Go ahead. I'm listening.

647
00:42:55,204 --> 00:42:59,684
♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫

648
00:43:01,604 --> 00:43:06,208
♫ The heart gradually silences ♫

649
00:43:07,588 --> 00:43:14,176
♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫

650
00:43:14,176 --> 00:43:19,264
♫ I can't delete them ♫

651
00:43:20,324 --> 00:43:26,336
♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫

652
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:33,216
♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫

653
00:43:33,216 --> 00:43:41,664
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

654
00:43:42,500 --> 00:43:46,496
♫ Fading away ♫

655
00:43:47,652 --> 00:43:54,144
♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫

656
00:43:54,144 --> 00:44:00,512
♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫

657
00:44:01,988 --> 00:44:08,864
♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫

658
00:44:08,864 --> 00:44:13,216
♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫

659
00:44:13,216 --> 00:44:19,584
♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫

660
00:44:19,584 --> 00:44:26,336
♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫

661
00:44:26,336 --> 00:44:33,664
♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫

662
00:44:33,664 --> 00:44:43,264
♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫
