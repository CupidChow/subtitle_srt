15
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:40,539
I heard that Miss Mofei is furious.

16
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:41,920
That's her own brother.

17
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,540
Do you think we'll be affected as well?

18
00:01:44,540 --> 00:01:46,660
If they find out who screwed it up,

19
00:01:46,660 --> 00:01:48,500
that person is doomed.

20
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:49,519
Where is Shen Xi?

21
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:53,100
It seems like she went to see
Miss Mofei about something.

22
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,144
Search.

23
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:01,879
Li Na, what are you doing?

24
00:02:01,879 --> 00:02:03,379
I don't think it's appropriate
to search someone's drawers.

25
00:02:03,379 --> 00:02:05,040
Li Na, you've gone too far.

26
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,840
This is the board taking evidence.

27
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,056
Any problem?

28
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:14,080
Mr. An, here.

29
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:31,680
So there's really a spy

30
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,319
in the company.

33
00:02:58,639 --> 00:02:59,712
It's my fault.

34
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,920
Shen Xi, it's your responsibility

35
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,000
to get things straight,

36
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,000
and that's what you owe to Mobai.

37
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,719
Do you dare to confess but not review?

38
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,479
I want the truth, not silence. Speak up.

39
00:03:20,479 --> 00:03:21,504
Miss Zhao,

40
00:03:25,159 --> 00:03:26,176
don't you get it?

41
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,439
Her silence is not
because she has nothing to say,

42
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:31,280
but it's hard to say, right?

43
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:35,479
She's got a lot more secrets than you think.

44
00:03:36,639 --> 00:03:37,728
Mr. An, what do you mean?

45
00:03:38,479 --> 00:03:39,900
Let me reintroduce

46
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,240
this assistant Shen.

47
00:03:41,824 --> 00:03:44,320
No, I should call you

48
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:45,960
Engineer Shen, right?

49
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,199
She was once the genius girl of German racing,

50
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,352
a female PhD
from German Institute of Technology.

51
00:03:52,352 --> 00:03:53,360
I knew that.

52
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,520
Here's what you don't know.

53
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:58,080
She's the designer of the Wings of Wind,

54
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,240
and also responsible for Shen Chuan's accident.

55
00:04:02,199 --> 00:04:04,599
And Markus did not disclose her identity

56
00:04:05,159 --> 00:04:06,208
because

57
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,599
she is Shen Chuan's sister.

58
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:19,759
This is her graduation paper.

59
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,659
It contains not only
Wings of Wind's design data,

60
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:24,279
but also a letter thanking her brother.

61
00:04:26,079 --> 00:04:28,560
The evidence is certain.

62
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,480
The Germans do keep their promise.

63
00:04:32,192 --> 00:04:35,000
Shen Chuan protected you well.

64
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,319
You are Shen Chuan's sister?

65
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:45,360
And you are also the engineer
for the Wings of Wind?

66
00:04:46,439 --> 00:04:48,079
She's the reason

67
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:49,980
making Markus lost

68
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:52,832
millions of dollars in stock back then.

69
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:56,940
You ruined your reputation in Germany
and then came back clean your name.

70
00:04:56,940 --> 00:04:59,340
You kept Mr. Mobai

71
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:01,560
and Ruifeng Group in the dark, right?

72
00:05:02,336 --> 00:05:03,419
I never thought so.

73
00:05:03,419 --> 00:05:05,160
I never thought of it that way.

74
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:08,240
Then why did you

75
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,759
hide who you are?

76
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,568
Mofei.

77
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,199
There's something I have to say

78
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,240
that Chen Mobai has known who she is all along.

79
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,519
She is the engineer
Chen Mobai has been waiting for.

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,519
He knew it and still let her tune the data.

81
00:05:37,319 --> 00:05:38,368
Right.

82
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,576
So you knew it too.

83
00:05:41,279 --> 00:05:42,399
Why didn't you stop Chen Mobai?

84
00:05:43,519 --> 00:05:44,608
Because

85
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:47,000
he trusts Shen Xi.

86
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:51,560
Nonsense! You're risking your life

87
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,199
and Ruifeng.

88
00:05:54,439 --> 00:05:55,920
What an absurd trust!

89
00:05:57,160 --> 00:05:58,176
Who's looking out for you?

90
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:01,120
Right now, Mr. Mobai's still in the ICU,

91
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:02,760
reporters are here every day,

92
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:04,359
and Junda's people are almost ecstatic,

93
00:06:04,359 --> 00:06:05,920
waiting to pull us down every day.

94
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,839
Miss Mofei, I have to warn you

95
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,120
that this matter

96
00:06:11,720 --> 00:06:13,160
is not an internal problem anymore,

97
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:15,800
please fire her now

98
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:17,760
and hand over to the police.

99
00:06:18,839 --> 00:06:21,160
This is my opinion, and I believe

100
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,008
so as the board of directors.

101
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:26,140
The press has already known about this.

102
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,839
If I fire her now,

103
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,560
it's just going to cause rumors.

104
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,248
Miss Mofei, I'm sorry. I won't

105
00:06:38,959 --> 00:06:40,000
put the company in a dilemma.

106
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,519
I will resign.

107
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:47,319
Those who make mistakes
have no right to run away.

108
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,100
I'm telling you, you're going to

109
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:51,560
stay here

110
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,920
until the full investigation comes out.

111
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,879

Shen Xi.

116
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:58,240
What's the matter?

117
00:07:58,240 --> 00:07:59,328
Get in the car.

118
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,480
Where are we going?

119
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,552
Get in.

120
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,360
Why are we here?

121
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:33,840
You're such a ruthless person.

122
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,399
To throw you into the sea
to feed the fish, of course.

123
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,279
Tell me why you're running away.

124
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,919
Chen Mobai said he trusts you.

125
00:08:55,936 --> 00:08:58,496
Others make judgments based on logic,

126
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,504
but he's the only one who goes by instinct.

127
00:09:02,759 --> 00:09:04,120
His instincts are wrong.

128
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:06,368
Really?

129
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,460
It seems you don't know Chen Mobai

130
00:09:09,460 --> 00:09:10,679
as well as he knows you.

131
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,860
In fact, Chen Mobai has been

132
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,080
a person who is hard to trust others
since he's a kid.

133
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:21,279
He's been confronting
his sister and his father.

134
00:09:22,679 --> 00:09:23,759
The only one who supported him, his mother,

135
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,799
has gone when he just became an adult.

136
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:30,720
Don't be fooled by his chuckles and laughter.

137
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,519
But it's really hard for him to open up.

138
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,399
But he chose to trust in you

139
00:09:42,799 --> 00:09:44,159
and bet everything.

140
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,440
Actually, I am really torn.

141
00:09:50,799 --> 00:09:52,600
As his friend of so many years,

142
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,240
if I blame you,

143
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,000
does that mean he really
make the wrong judgment?

144
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,039
If I choose to trust him,

145
00:10:06,039 --> 00:10:07,600
should I also trust his judgment?

146
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:13,639
I don't deserve his trust.

147
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,559
But if he chose to trust you,

148
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:20,039
there must be a reason.

149
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:25,248
In this case,

00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:04,959
just finished checking the indicators,

185
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,000
and he's now stable.

186
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,200
Are you his family member?

187
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:10,784
No.

188
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,080
I've already known how to handle this.

189
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:26,048
I'll talk to him later.

190
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,544
It's not up to him this time.

191
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,879
The patient's brain nerve should be fine.

192
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,000
There are minor physical injuries remain,

193
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,160
which will be fine after resting for a while.

194
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,760
- Thank you, Dr. Guo.
- Not at all.

195
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:46,000
- You've worked hard.
- Not at all.

196
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:46,112
Where is Shen Xi?

197
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,272
Where are Hao Yang and the others?

198
00:16:53,720 --> 00:16:55,200
Shouldn't I be surrounded by a bunch of people

199
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:56,224
like on TV?

200
00:16:56,224 --> 00:16:57,280
Why is it just you?

201
00:16:58,159 --> 00:16:59,168
I told them to leave.

202
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:01,344
You need to rest now.

203
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:09,079
Now everyone in the company
knows who Shen Xi is

204
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:11,319
and the fact that she tuned the data for you.

205
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,160
Oh, no. I just woke up
and you're telling me that.

206
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:26,840
I think you should

207
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,240
say something to comfort me.

208
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:29,319
But I let her stay.

209
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:31,720
I will fire her until you're done
with the pre-season test.

210
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:35,240
After all, the loss of the company
is really serious this time.

211
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:37,799
You are a CEO of Ruifeng,

212
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:41,519
don't you feel guilty to torture
your own employees like this?

213
00:17:41,519 --> 00:17:42,880
What did I do?

214
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:45,460
Didn't you just give her a suspended sentence?

215
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,119
Let her stay at the company,

216
00:17:49,319 --> 00:17:50,400
how will others treat her?

217
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:53,856
So what?

218
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,240
This is the punishment
of those who make mistakes.

219
00:18:00,599 --> 00:18:02,200
I just woke up

220
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:04,279
and you're telling me all this.

221
00:18:05,279 --> 00:18:07,279
I might as well stay in a coma.

222
00:18:08,279 --> 00:18:09,759
Don't you like to hear that?

223
00:18:09,759 --> 00:18:11,359
I'll tell you one more thing
that you don't like to hear.

224
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,392
From now on,

225
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,960
don't have anything to do with her,

226
00:18:20,119 --> 00:18:21,319
including her leaving Ruifeng.

227
00:18:23,328 --> 00:18:24,400
If you don't agree,

228
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,079
I will expose who she is to the public.

229
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,960
You know better than I do
what the consequences are.

230
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:36,079
Alright.

231
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:39,240
I thought it's something big.

232
00:18:40,279 --> 00:18:42,400
Don't you think this is
making me feel bad enough?

233
00:18:43,279 --> 00:18:44,559
I want to live longer.

234
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,080
Well, then it's settled.

235
00:18:53,759 --> 00:18:55,160
- But I have warned you…
- Alright.

236
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:56,400
I got it.

237
00:19:10,680 --> 00:19:12,960
This is going to be a disaster
for the administrative department.

238
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,599
No more bonus at the end of year.

239
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:19,960
Don't be that exaggerated.

240
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:21,140
Just wait and see.

241
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:23,319
All thanks to some black sheep.

242
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:25,820
Even tamper with the team's data.

243
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:28,928
You are so capable.
I think you can handle the work alone.

244
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,039
Shen Xi, you know what kind of person Bi is.

245
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:39,616
Just bear with it.

246
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,480
I can't believe you have the cheek to stay.

247
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:46,680
Do you still want to hang out
in front of Mr. Mobai?

248
00:19:48,759 --> 00:19:50,200
Did I hit your concern?

249
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:53,519
I've got the fruit and tea ready.

250
00:19:53,519 --> 00:19:54,660
I'll go busy.

251
00:19:54,660 --> 00:19:55,719
If I were her,

252
00:19:55,719 --> 00:19:57,200
I'd have quit my job and left.

253
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,380
- Okay, right?
- Okay.

254
00:20:11,380 --> 00:20:12,720
- You go busy.
- Fine, okay.

255
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,480
You're just out of the hospital. Put it down.

256
00:20:21,319 --> 00:20:22,368
Take it easy.

257
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:24,119
This is your third life.

258
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:26,079
I have six more lives.

259
00:20:27,279 --> 00:20:28,759
Do you know what I admire most about you?

260
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,039
I have so many to admire. Which one?

261
00:20:34,319 --> 00:20:36,039
You are ruthless.

262
00:20:37,279 --> 00:20:38,360
You're not ruthless to others,

263
00:20:38,360 --> 00:20:39,360
but to yourself.

264
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,359
You care so much about her,

265
00:20:41,359 --> 00:20:43,559
but you still can bear not to see her.

266
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,119
Are you blaming her too?

267
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:49,440
Don't talk nonsense.

268
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:51,759
I have nothing to do with Shen Xi right now.

269
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,919
I didn't even say who.

270
00:20:53,919 --> 00:20:55,119
Why did you just admit it?

271
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:03,440
I'm telling you, impulse spoils great plans.

272
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:05,180
What is your great plan them?

273
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:06,599
My great plan is,

274
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:11,480
no one can defend her

275
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:13,039
in this situation,

276
00:21:14,119 --> 00:21:15,480
even she doesn't trust herself.

277
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:18,079
Until I can figure out a way

278
00:21:18,079 --> 00:21:19,740
to clear her name,

279
00:21:19,740 --> 00:21:20,832
the best I can do

280
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,960
is not to cause her any trouble.

281
00:21:24,599 --> 00:21:27,000
Anyway, I'm sure it's not her fault.

282
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,200
I have to find a way to clear her name.

283
00:21:37,720 --> 00:21:38,720
Did you see Shen Xi?

284
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,960
She's quite pitiful now.

285
00:21:40,599 --> 00:21:43,160
Administration's performance
for the quarter has been canceled.

286
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,160
Can you not blame her?

287
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:45,216
Indeed.

288
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,200
Forget it.

289
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:03,968
Has Miss Mofei completed the meeting?

290
00:22:04,680 --> 00:22:06,119
I'm here to report the recovery training.

291
00:22:06,759 --> 00:22:07,940
Miss Mofei is still in a meeting.

292
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,119
Please wait in the small conference room.

293
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,960
Sorry, the meeting took a little longer today.

294
00:22:37,119 --> 00:22:38,179
The Board finally gave in.

295
00:22:38,179 --> 00:22:39,240
That's the end of it.

296
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,168
Shen Xi! Yang, go check her.

297
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:50,759
- Did you get burned?
- Don't go there.

298
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,640
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

299
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,799
- I accidentally knocked it over myself.
- Chen Mofei is watching us.

300
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:54,880
I will take care of it.

301
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:56,960
I'm okay.

302
00:23:04,920 --> 00:23:06,079
Then let's call it a day.

303
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,359
Are you okay?

304
00:23:16,359 --> 00:23:17,440
Maybe you should go to the infirmary.

305
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:21,020
I'm fine, Miss Zhao.

306
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,119
I don't need to go to the infirmary.

307
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:23,840
I have work to do.

308
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,448
Let's go.

309
00:23:42,400 --> 00:23:43,488
Chen Mobai,

310
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:47,380
you trusted Shen Xi at the beginning

311
00:23:47,380 --> 00:23:48,559
in her data tuning,

312
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:51,080
nobody expected an accident.

313
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,839
Don't you think she's upset too?

314
00:23:55,279 --> 00:23:56,359
So what?

315
00:23:56,359 --> 00:23:57,799
So, you shouldn't treat her like this.

316
00:24:03,319 --> 00:24:05,000
Isn't that what she deserves?

317
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:34,640
<i>According to the assumptions of physics,</i>

318
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:36,680
<i>when you go fast enough,</i>

319
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:39,559
<i>you're not going forward in time,</i>

320
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,839
<i>but going back in time.</i>

321
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,680
<i>Maybe I was just too fast,</i>

322
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,480
<i>so I ended up back to square one,</i>

323
00:24:52,079 --> 00:24:53,799
<i>or even worse.</i>

324
00:24:54,839 --> 00:24:56,480
<i>Now even the only light</i>

325
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,464
<i>is gone.</i>

326
00:25:01,519 --> 00:25:03,160
<i>It makes one thing clear</i>

327
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:06,759
<i>that I don't deserve a fresh start,</i>

328
00:25:07,359 --> 00:25:08,440
<i>or a new life.</i>

329
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:17,696
Xi.

330
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,288
Why are you sitting here?

331
00:25:22,519 --> 00:25:23,648
What happened to your leg?

332
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,680
I'll get you to the hospital.

333
00:25:27,680 --> 00:25:29,759
No need, it's not that serious.

334
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,488
No need for hospital.

335
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,656
Doesn't it hurt?

336
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:44,359
A little pain is better than nothing.

337
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:48,039
You've been getting more stubborn lately.

338
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,240
Is this because of that driver?

339
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:53,856
Shaoqian.

340
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:56,359
Will you leave me alone?

341
00:26:01,640 --> 00:26:02,656
Just three sentences.

342
00:26:04,448 --> 00:26:07,136
Xi, I'll just say three sentences.

343
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,232
One,

344
00:26:16,319 --> 00:26:18,559
all wounds will heal,

345
00:26:19,720 --> 00:26:20,736
including this one

346
00:26:21,680 --> 00:26:22,688
and the past ones.

347
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,288
Two,

348
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:30,720
I'm not going back to Germany for a while.

349
00:26:33,119 --> 00:26:34,208
Why?

350
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,720
Aren't you supposed to race next season?

351
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:40,640
I have more important things to do here.

352
00:26:43,839 --> 00:26:44,928
Three,

353
00:26:47,359 --> 00:26:48,880
if you decide

354
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:49,960
you don't want to be here anymore,

355
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:52,640
come back to Germany with me.

356
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,319
Time will heal everything.

357
00:26:59,599 --> 00:27:00,880
No one will talk about the past anymore.

358
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:04,279
Everything will start over.

359
00:27:11,359 --> 00:27:12,480
I'm done.

360
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,400
Thank you, Shaoqian.

361
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,759
I'll still stay here.

362
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,424
Xi.

363
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,119
You've punished yourself for too long.

364
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,160
Xi.

365
00:27:41,599 --> 00:27:42,759
They don't know anything about you

366
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:45,472
or your potential,

367
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:49,480
otherwise, how could they believe
you would make such a mistake?

368
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,680
You are Shen Xi.

369
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,119
You just finished your rehab,

370
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,160
don't push yourself too hard.

371
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,119
How much, Monkey?

372
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:45,040
Mobai, you should take a rest first.

373
00:28:45,040 --> 00:28:47,140
It's already tough for you.

374
00:28:47,140 --> 00:28:48,160
What's the lap time?

375
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,808
1:35.

376
00:28:52,352 --> 00:28:53,920
That bad?

377
00:28:53,920 --> 00:28:55,008
Miss Liu.

378
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:56,840
What's going on?

379
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,620
Mr. Mobai, safety comes first.

380
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:01,780
I wouldn't dare push you too hard,

381
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,380
or Miss Mofei would kill me.

382
00:29:03,380 --> 00:29:04,720
What?

383
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:06,700
I don't have that much time.

384
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:08,459
I don't want safety first. I want speed.

385
00:29:08,459 --> 00:29:10,060
Monkey, tune the data.

386
00:29:10,060 --> 00:29:11,500
Mobai, I beg you.

387
00:29:11,500 --> 00:29:13,380
Forget about beating Mitsui Taku
in pre-season testing.

388
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:14,920
Miss Zhao and Miss Mofei can understand that.

389
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:17,360
Yes, you're forcing Miss Liu to speed up.

390
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,496
Don't you make things difficult for her?

391
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:21,920
Then replace it with the data
used before the accident.

392
00:29:23,519 --> 00:29:26,680
At least the data will keep the speed.

393
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:28,608
Find it out.

394
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:30,272
Give me the helmet.

395
00:29:35,876 --> 00:29:38,564

00:31:14,359 --> 00:31:15,424
don't bother Shen Xi.

407
00:31:45,280 --> 00:31:46,380
Why is the power off?

408
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,759
- Why is the power off?
- The power is off.

409
00:31:47,759 --> 00:31:48,832
Chao is not down yet.

410
00:31:48,832 --> 00:31:51,584
- The power is off.
- The power supply got some problem.

411
00:31:52,119 --> 00:31:53,860
Don't panic, everyone. Stay safe.

412
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:54,920
Don't panic.

413
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:59,680
W-What are you doing? The power's out up there.

414
00:32:23,480 --> 00:32:25,240
Shen Xi.

415
00:32:28,920 --> 00:32:30,079
Shen Xi, wait for me.

416
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:51,872
Are you okay?

417
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,080
I'm okay.

418
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,759
I heard you are calling me, so I rushed over.

419
00:32:58,079 --> 00:32:59,168
Does it hurt?

420
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:03,000
It's too dark, so I fell.

421
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:05,888
Why…

422
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:07,840
Why did you come back?

423
00:33:15,079 --> 00:33:16,192
I came to pick up my stuff.

424
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:19,840
What?

425
00:33:26,560 --> 00:33:27,616
I got it.

426
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:46,659
W-What are you doing? I…

427
00:33:46,659 --> 00:33:49,728
I-I can walk by myself. I'm fine.

428
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:52,768
Hold on tight.

429
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,056
Are you trying to strangle me?

430
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:36,360
I-I thought

431
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:39,159
shortening the lever
will make it easier for you,

432
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,519
so I hold on to you tighter.

433
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:11,239
Now that you're all right, go home.

434
00:35:50,920 --> 00:35:53,659
<i>[Miss Liu]</i>
Mr. Mobai, just now Miss Qiao came to the team

435
00:35:53,659 --> 00:35:55,199
and took away all the data
that Shen Xi revised.

436
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:00,880
Today the expert group came
to visit the battery laboratory.

437
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:03,639
What are you up to again?

438
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,800
We made a deal

439
00:36:07,320 --> 00:36:09,199
that I would be in charge
of the team when I got back.

440
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:12,440
Why do I have to ask
your permission to use data?

441
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:14,840
Why do you have to intervene in everything?

442
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,199
You promised me not to
care about Shen Xi anymore.

443
00:36:18,760 --> 00:36:20,480
You didn't keep your word either, did you?

444
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:25,320
The experts are a few minutes away.

445
00:36:26,880 --> 00:36:27,960
No more discussion on this.

446
00:36:28,760 --> 00:36:30,340
Let him pick out a few parts
and put it on my account.

447
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:32,960
What? Are you trying to pressure me
with your CEO position?

448
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:35,328
Yeah.

449
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,079
No matter what she does,

450
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:46,920
it's all because she cares about you.

451
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,320
Why can't you just understand her?

452
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,599
I'm just defending myself.

453
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,000
The best thing she can do is to leave me alone.

454
00:36:56,639 --> 00:36:58,848
Alright, you go get busy, Mr. Mobai.

455
00:37:04,599 --> 00:37:05,600
Professor He.

456
00:37:05,600 --> 00:37:06,656
Miss Mofei.

457
00:37:06,656 --> 00:37:07,968
- Hello.
- That's very kind of you.

458
00:37:08,599 --> 00:37:10,820
Welcome to visit our Ruifeng factory

459
00:37:10,820 --> 00:37:13,320
and guide our research and development
of Maituo batteries.

460
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:14,980
Let's go to check chassis dynamometer first.

461
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,119
Alright.

462
00:37:16,119 --> 00:37:17,639
Here are the materials we prepared for you.

463
00:37:20,239 --> 00:37:21,599
Up to now,

464
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:23,099
our Maituo new battery

465
00:37:23,099 --> 00:37:25,560
<i>[Vehicle Chassis Dynamometer Station, Ruifeng Factory]</i>
has obtained qualified data

466
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,119
in various performance indicators

467
00:37:28,119 --> 00:37:30,580
such as voltage, capacity, internal resistance,

468
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:32,119
energy power cycle number
and self-discharge rate.

469
00:37:32,992 --> 00:37:35,699
Some aspects even far exceed the current

470
00:37:35,699 --> 00:37:37,079
lithium-ion batteries for vehicles.

471
00:37:38,199 --> 00:37:41,040
Of course, these are just

472
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:44,800
the results of virtual running in the lab.

473
00:37:45,320 --> 00:37:46,464
That's pretty good.

474
00:37:47,599 --> 00:37:49,740
Ion batteries are the ticket

475
00:37:49,740 --> 00:37:51,519
to the next new era of electric vehicles.

476
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:54,200
You guys are just one step
away from getting it.

477
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:56,000
So you must be steady in this step.

478
00:37:56,639 --> 00:37:57,856
Of course.

479
00:37:57,856 --> 00:38:00,719
Duanmu Kuan is still waiting
to introduce you to

480
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,880
the more details.

481
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:03,639
Let's move to the conference room.

482
00:38:04,639 --> 00:38:06,199
Professor He, this way please.

483
00:38:06,199 --> 00:38:07,264
Okay.

484
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:16,519
Did you get to him last night?

485
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,936
No.

486
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,760
We ran into each other.

487
00:38:22,719 --> 00:38:23,960
You stay away from Chen Mobai,

488
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:25,840
or don't blame me.

489
00:39:16,159 --> 00:39:17,300
Alright, I'll look for it right away.

490
00:39:17,300 --> 00:39:19,519
Didn't you use the key
to the warehouse last time?

491
00:39:20,320 --> 00:39:21,920
Don't worry, I'm looking for it right now.

492
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:34,404
<i>[Data]</i>

493
00:39:38,948 --> 00:39:40,228

494
00:39:43,800 --> 00:39:44,864
Oh no.

495
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,760
Do you know you caused a lot of trouble?

496
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:57,980
I asked you to send the order form

497
00:39:57,980 --> 00:39:59,619
to the new battery parts factory in Jiangmen,

498
00:39:59,619 --> 00:40:01,039
and you sent it to the old factory in Zhuzhou.

499
00:40:02,592 --> 00:40:03,640
Did I send it wrong?

500
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:05,079
What are you doing?

501
00:40:05,079 --> 00:40:06,440
Do you know that

502
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:08,760
the agreement to switch factories
has not been signed yet?

503
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,760
The old factory had no idea about it.

504
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:13,060
This is like revealing our secret.

505
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,280
They're furious now.

506
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,880
So, what now?

507
00:40:19,039 --> 00:40:20,820
Sort out all the old factory agreements.

508
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,679
The top management of the business division

509
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:24,240
will help you clean up the mess at 3 p.m.

510
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,320
But I…

511
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:27,760
I'm telling you, not a minute later.

512
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:30,320
But I took the afternoon off,

513
00:40:30,320 --> 00:40:31,820
my sister is about to give birth.

514
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:34,400
It's not you who's giving birth,
what's the rush?

515
00:40:35,000 --> 00:40:37,200
But my sister is an elderly parturient woman
and she has the premature delivery,

516
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,780
so I have to stay at the hospital.

517
00:40:38,780 --> 00:40:40,119
If the materials can't be done,

518
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,760
and it causes problems
in Maituo's parts supply,

519
00:40:43,719 --> 00:40:44,800
you'll take all the blame.

520
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,360
Oh, my sister.

521
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,168
You'd better go.

522
00:41:01,199 --> 00:41:02,880
I'll sort the files by number.

523
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:05,120
If I act quickly,

524
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,700
two hours for binding and inspection
should be enough.

525
00:41:07,700 --> 00:41:08,832
But I…

526
00:41:09,719 --> 00:41:11,079
Don't you hold any grudges?

527
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:15,039
It's going to be too late
if you don't leave now.

528
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:22,144
There is a thing…

529
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,416
What is it?

530
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,079
Everything…

531
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:30,840
I'm sorry, really sorry.

532
00:41:45,519 --> 00:41:47,000
I'll make it up to you.

533
00:42:15,119 --> 00:42:16,679
Assistant Bi, why are you here?

534
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:18,368
Well…

535
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:21,519
I want to confess something to Mr. Mobai.

536
00:42:26,920 --> 00:42:27,936
Well…

537
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:31,712
I…

538
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:33,536
I…

539
00:42:34,559 --> 00:42:35,599
You can figure it out before you speak.

540
00:42:37,360 --> 00:42:39,440
I don't think Shen Xi caused that accident.

547
00:43:24,288 --> 00:43:32,736
<i>♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫</i>

548
00:43:33,572 --> 00:43:37,568
<i>♫ Fading away ♫</i>

549
00:43:38,724 --> 00:43:45,216
<i>♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫</i>

550
00:43:45,216 --> 00:43:51,584
<i>♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫</i>

551
00:43:53,060 --> 00:43:59,936
<i>♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫</i>

552
00:43:59,936 --> 00:44:04,288
<i>♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫</i>

553
00:44:04,288 --> 00:44:10,656
<i>♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫</i>

554
00:44:10,656 --> 00:44:17,408
<i>♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫</i>

555
00:44:17,408 --> 00:44:24,736
<i>♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫</i>

556
00:44:24,736 --> 00:44:34,336
<i>♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫</i>
