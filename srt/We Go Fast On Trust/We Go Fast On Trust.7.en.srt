19
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,919

the surgery was very successful.

how about we make dumplings together?

You want to eat dumplings?

25
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:45,120
I want the kind you used to make

What do you mean?

43
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:06,800
Why did you suddenly turn
against what we had agreed upon before?

44
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,280
What Chen Mofei pursues is different from me.

45
00:04:11,296 --> 00:04:12,439
I can't go back.

46
00:04:12,439 --> 00:04:14,700
How is it different?
Aren't both pursuits for results?

47
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,920
I consider car racing my life,

48
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:17,888
but she treats car racing as a business.
Why would I go back?

49
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:20,439
You're a car racer.

50
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,200
She's a businesswoman.

51
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,040
Even if the matters of bribery are true,

52
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,759

takes what they need?

53
00:04:27,399 --> 00:04:28,720

54
00:04:30,079 --> 00:04:31,120

Alright,

56
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:42,360
then let me talk to you
from a friend's position.

57
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:45,399
If you don't go back to Ruifeng,
how will you run the Formula A?

58
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,680
We will find our own sponsors,

59
00:04:50,319 --> 00:04:51,480
expand the team, and keep racing.

60
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,299
It's a good idea,

61
00:04:54,299 --> 00:04:56,560
but reality might not let you be so optimistic.

62
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,680
Why?

63
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,640
Takano and Junda
have a joint venture relationship.

64
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,180
Once they get into Formula A,
even if no one explicit it,

65
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:06,000
they are Takano's satellite team.

66
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:07,879
They will receive a lot of technical support.

67
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,660
Many emerging teams have French teams
working for them.

68
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,776
The progress is rapid.

69
00:05:11,776 --> 00:05:13,720
Those veteran teams are
all about German technology.

70
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,179
They consistently rank in the top group.

71
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:18,720
How are you going to stand out in the race
as an independent participant?

72
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,199
I know all the things you are talking about.

73
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:24,419
I understand that physical conditions
of the cars are indeed important.

74
00:05:24,419 --> 00:05:25,472

75
00:05:26,079 --> 00:05:27,120
technology comes first.

Alright, let's talk about technology.

77
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:32,220
You've made a bold statement before.

78

you wanted to defeat,

82

84
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:48,399
treat racing as your life,

85
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:50,320
you should cherish it

86
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:52,079
and make the correct choice
as soon as possible.

87
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,399
You should know
that every second you're wasting now

88

89

00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:11,120
Please book me a ticket home for next week.

181
00:13:05,159 --> 00:13:06,240
Didn't I tell you not to…?

182
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:10,912
Morning.

183
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:14,880
Why are you here?

184
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,919
Didn't I tell you
to take good care of your mom?

185
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:22,752
My mom's much better.

186
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:25,879
So I want to sort out your matters first.

187
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,608
What matters?

188
00:13:34,039 --> 00:13:36,159
I've looked up the new information
on the Formula A.

189
00:13:37,399 --> 00:13:39,519
<i>[Formula B Record Table, Lu Yunhao, Junda Team]</i>
I've formulated a promotion plan for the team.

190
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:41,720
Hope it can help you.

191
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,680
I mainly analyzed several aspects.

192
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:47,776
The first is cost.

193
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,960
It's much more than you budgeted.

194
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,399
Then technical support.

195
00:13:53,639 --> 00:13:55,560
You need an entirely new engineering team

196
00:13:55,560 --> 00:13:57,720
and a wind tunnel lab to build your car.

197
00:13:58,480 --> 00:13:59,519
And sports injuries.

198
00:14:01,039 --> 00:14:02,880
You have to have a professional fitness coach

199
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,519
to make a training plan.

200
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:07,720
You can check the other specific data later.

201
00:14:08,416 --> 00:14:09,504
Overall,

202
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,880
joining a large car company like Ruifeng

203
00:14:11,880 --> 00:14:13,120
is not the best choice,

204
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:15,776
but it's the only choice.

205
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:20,800
I accept your suggestion.

206
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:23,840
If I want to run Formula A,

207
00:14:26,879 --> 00:14:28,519
large carmakers' support is indeed necessary.

208
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,080
So I'm considering joining Junda.

209
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,399
No way, you try to persuade him.

210
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,039
Anyway under no circumstances
should this be acceptable.

211
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,840
I'm not yet familiar with Junda's conditions.

212
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:54,279
But if they can offer
the same conditions as Ruifeng,

213
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,896
it's not ruled out.

214
00:14:57,759 --> 00:14:59,840
Didn't you come for Mofei?

215
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,080
I can't just focus on my own task.

216
00:15:03,960 --> 00:15:05,719
The important thing about choosing a team

217
00:15:05,719 --> 00:15:07,200
is the driver's opinion.

218
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,159
Anyway, I'm strongly against this.

219
00:15:26,919 --> 00:15:28,032
Alright.

220
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:32,360
Thanks for your proposal.

221
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:35,104
This matter

222
00:15:37,919 --> 00:15:39,008
has been thoroughly resolved.

223
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,279
Your mission is over too.

224
00:15:47,559 --> 00:15:48,672
Well,

225
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,168
let it be.

226
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,112
I'm off now.

227
00:16:12,519 --> 00:16:13,568
Goodbye.

228
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:16,096
Goodbye.

229
00:16:36,960 --> 00:16:38,320
Chen Mobai wants to sign to Junda.

230
00:16:44,679 --> 00:16:46,000
Should we try talking to him again?

231
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,080
There might be room for reversal.

232
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,919
He's done everything so ruthlessly.

233
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:53,824
He won't come back.

234
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:56,448
I know him.

235
00:16:56,448 --> 00:16:57,472
He was like this before.

236
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,648
He's still the same now.

237
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,600
Am I a really terrible sister,

238
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:06,039
turning my own brother into an enemy?

239
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:09,920
No, he just has a lot of misunderstandings
about you.

240
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:15,936
Let's not talk about these things for now.

241
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:17,920
You haven't rested well for many days.

242
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,319
I'll take you home to sleep well.

243
00:17:21,279 --> 00:17:22,279
I can't sleep at all.

244
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,519
I need to figure out how to face Zhao Yingning

245
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,200
and how to convince the directors.

246
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,759
Hello.

247
00:17:39,759 --> 00:17:41,119
Miss Mofei, this is Duanmu Kuan.

248
00:17:42,359 --> 00:17:43,800
Mr. Kuan, what's going on?

249
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:45,080
The multi-layered technology of the battery

250
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:46,480
has finally passed the electrochemical test

251
00:17:47,119 --> 00:17:48,288
and achieved a stable structure.

252
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,032
That's great.

253
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,720
I shouldn't disturb you so late.

254
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:56,640
I just wanted to report to you.

255
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:57,839
Please come take a look tomorrow.

256
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:00,200
Okay, thank you for your hard work, Mr. Kuan.

257
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,359
Would you like to go over now and take a look?

258
00:18:08,800 --> 00:18:09,920
I'll go prepare the car.

259
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,119
I know this is a big deal for you.

260
00:18:22,839 --> 00:18:24,440
This one can do.

261
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,119
This one is not bad either. I like it.

262
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:33,720
Where's my necklace?

263
00:18:34,920 --> 00:18:36,119
How many have you bought in the end?

264
00:18:37,839 --> 00:18:38,912
Not many, not many.

265
00:18:42,039 --> 00:18:44,440
Next time, I'll suggest auntie
to cancel your credit card.

266
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,460
I've tried it too.

267
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:49,240
I wanted to turn around and leave the mall.

268
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:51,200
But look at these clothes.

269
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:53,219
They are so beautiful.

270
00:18:53,219 --> 00:18:54,640
They all have souls.

271
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,240
They seem to be softly calling out

272
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,240
"I need you."

273
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,880
"I need you."

274
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:04,832
By the way,

275
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:07,640
this outfit seems to suit you quite well.

276
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:10,280
After all, you now spend

277
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:11,799
your days with Chen Mobai.

278
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:13,799
Here's a small suggestion for you.

279
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,440
Nice clothes

280
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:17,319
can boost your love fortune.

281
00:19:18,079 --> 00:19:19,760
Fortune is the Barnum effect.

282
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,500
It has no scientific basis.

283
00:19:21,500 --> 00:19:23,600
It's merely a psychological hint
one gives oneself.

284
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,339
Besides, I'm not in a relationship.

285
00:19:25,339 --> 00:19:26,799
I've stopped going to his place.

286
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,664
Why?

287
00:19:30,279 --> 00:19:31,880
I was trying to persuade him
to go back to Ruifeng,

288
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,799
but it seems like he wants to go to Junda.

289
00:19:34,799 --> 00:19:35,968
Junda?

290
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,440
Isn't that the mortal enemy of Ruifeng?

291
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:39,520
You didn't stop him?

292
00:19:42,240 --> 00:19:43,620
This isn't like you.

293
00:19:43,620 --> 00:19:44,920
Aren't you the one who never stops running

294
00:19:44,920 --> 00:19:46,599
until the task is complete?

295
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,400
Robot, there's something wrong
with your programming.

296
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:55,760
For a driver,

297
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,200
hardware is indeed essential.

298
00:19:57,799 --> 00:19:59,640
But so is the mental state.

299
00:20:01,319 --> 00:20:03,599
If he finds it hard to go back to Ruifeng,

300
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:05,639
joining another team

301
00:20:05,639 --> 00:20:07,079
might be a better choice.

302
00:20:09,279 --> 00:20:11,079
You've been acting odd lately,

303
00:20:12,119 --> 00:20:13,216
very odd indeed.

304
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:16,960
You've started caring about living things,

305
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:18,656
like this bean sprout,

306
00:20:19,319 --> 00:20:21,200
like Chen Mobai's feelings.

307
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:23,200
And you claim you two aren't dating?

308
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,799
I don't care about his feelings.

309
00:20:26,799 --> 00:20:28,939
As a competent engineer,

310
00:20:28,939 --> 00:20:31,599
I should offer objective advice and analysis.

311
00:20:32,279 --> 00:20:35,119
You just said you were an engineer?

312
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:41,216
I…

313
00:20:44,839 --> 00:20:45,888
Great!

314
00:20:46,519 --> 00:20:48,519
I'm glad to see
you're back to your normal state.

315
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:54,660
But I have to add,

316
00:20:54,660 --> 00:20:56,800
every time Junda makes the trending news,

317
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,260
it's never for good reasons.

318
00:20:58,260 --> 00:21:00,480
If Chen Mobai really intends
to go to that company,

319
00:21:01,519 --> 00:21:03,160
I think you should warn him to be careful.

320
00:21:05,160 --> 00:21:06,519
I see.

321
00:21:06,519 --> 00:21:09,280
However, that's not the main point for tonight.

322
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:11,000
Tonight's main point is

323
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:14,200
I have sorted these clothes out for you.

324
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:16,660
Now I'm going to take them to your bedroom.

325
00:21:16,660 --> 00:21:18,200
Please remember to wear them.

326
00:21:18,839 --> 00:21:21,160
These are what I saved up and bought for you.

327
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:23,119
Don't let my intentions go in vain.

328
00:22:15,716 --> 00:22:18,116
<i>[Junda Automobile Group Limited]</i>

329
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,920
Why are you here?

330
00:22:27,920 --> 00:22:30,599
I still have some work to finish.

331
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,799
Don't you have anything else to do?

332
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,720
Your mission is complete. Please leave.

333
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:39,920
No way, I'm here to ensure your rights
are not violated.

334
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,720
You're not a lawyer. How can you ensure that?

335
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,264
Chen Mobai.

336
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,200
You've been following me to the same team.

337
00:22:48,832 --> 00:22:50,016
You've run out of options?

338
00:22:50,016 --> 00:22:51,400
Are you afraid that if I join your team,

339
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,759
your position isn't safe?

340
00:22:53,319 --> 00:22:54,880
You've never grown up.

341
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:56,000
Still caring about this.

342
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,560
Don't tell me you really think
they see your potential.

343
00:22:57,560 --> 00:22:58,799
You're just a gimmick.

344
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:00,900
Even being a gimmick

345
00:23:00,900 --> 00:23:02,640
is better than not being worthy of even that.

346
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,320
You…

347
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:06,048
Mr. Mobai is here.

348
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,680
Yunhao,

349
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:09,140
you guys were from the same school.

350
00:23:09,140 --> 00:23:10,400
Soon you'll become teammates.

351
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,020
You must be humble and get along well.

352
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,420
I have to be humble to Takano on the field.

353
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:14,960
Why should I be humble to him here?

354
00:23:17,039 --> 00:23:18,119
Alright, come, this way please.

355
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:24,200
You've been dumped so soon.

356
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:37,728
Let's go.

357
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:49,568
Mr. Zhang, hello.

358
00:23:56,559 --> 00:23:57,632
Mr. Mobai.

359
00:23:59,079 --> 00:24:00,240
Didn't expect you to really come.

360
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:02,839
Bringing glory to Junda.

361
00:24:03,480 --> 00:24:04,576
I'm honored.

362
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:07,119
Mr. Jiang, thank you for your invitation.

363
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,540
Don't call me Mr. Jiang. Call me Jun.

364
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,880
We are all buddies in the future.

365
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:13,560
I, Jiang Yijun, will definitely
not let my buddies down.

366
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,680
Okay, please come inside.

367
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:17,659
Excuse me, Miss.

368
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,300
This is our internal meeting at Junda.

369
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:20,540
Could you please step aside?

370
00:24:20,540 --> 00:24:22,380
She is the friend
I brought intentionally today.

371
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:25,359
Isn't this the one
who helped you appeal last time?

372
00:24:26,359 --> 00:24:27,880
She's from Ruifeng.

373
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:30,400
What's wrong with Ruifeng?

374
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,159
We, Junda, and Ruifeng are brother companies.

375
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,960
We are both fighting
for the cause of national cars.

376
00:24:34,559 --> 00:24:35,680
No distinctions.

377
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:37,952
Come here.

378
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,960
<i>[Driver's Contract]</i>
I've read the contract. Everything else is fine.

379
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,300
There's only one thing I want to make clear.

380
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:45,559
Go ahead.

381
00:24:45,559 --> 00:24:47,400
I'm all ears.

382
00:24:47,960 --> 00:24:49,880
I see a clause in the contract,

383
00:24:51,319 --> 00:24:53,279
saying that I must obey all team arrangements.

384
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,160
But I just want to drive.

385
00:24:55,759 --> 00:24:57,240
I don't want to get involved with Ruifeng.

386
00:24:57,759 --> 00:25:00,440
Don't worry, Mobai, what we value in our team

387
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,319
is your ability.

388
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,599
You don't have to worry about anything
unrelated to racing.

389
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:09,960
You just need to show
your strong ability on the track.

390
00:25:11,599 --> 00:25:12,920
<i>I have to be humble to Takano on the field.</i>

391
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,440
<i>Why should I be humble to him here?</i>

392
00:25:16,359 --> 00:25:17,400
I have a question.

393
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,256
Little girl,

394
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,240
what's your question?

395
00:25:24,839 --> 00:25:25,840
It says in the contract

396
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:28,319
Chen Mobai needs to obey all team arrangements.

397
00:25:29,480 --> 00:25:31,359
You have a deep cooperation with Takano.

398
00:25:32,119 --> 00:25:33,799
So, will he need to cooperate tactically
with Takano

399
00:25:33,799 --> 00:25:37,480
in future races?

400
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:43,540
Cooperation, what kind of cooperation?

401
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,599
That is,

402
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:48,000
is Chen Mobai,
as part of Takano's satellite team,

403
00:25:48,759 --> 00:25:51,120
obligated to give way to Mitsui Taku to assist

404
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:54,680
for Junda's benefit during the race?

405
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,340
We are not a satellite team.

406
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,819
Our collaboration with Takano is comprehensive.

407
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:02,176
They make our cars run faster

408
00:26:02,176 --> 00:26:03,232
and provide comprehensive cooperation…

409
00:26:03,232 --> 00:26:04,320
Stop beating around the bush.

410
00:26:04,839 --> 00:26:06,839
Answer her question directly.
Is there or isn't there?

411
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,959
Since it's a collaboration,

412
00:26:12,959 --> 00:26:15,140
we'll analyze specific situations specifically.

413
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:16,416
Analyze what?

414
00:26:18,599 --> 00:26:19,960
How to please Takano?

415
00:26:21,559 --> 00:26:22,980
I, Chen Mobai, won't accept such clauses

416
00:26:22,980 --> 00:26:24,599
which break the fairness of the race.

417
00:26:25,599 --> 00:26:26,740
Racing isn't a tool for you

418
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,279
to do unfair trades.

419
00:26:31,319 --> 00:26:32,384
Mobai, don't be angry.

420
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:35,039
If there is anything in the contract
that you are not satisfied with,

421
00:26:35,799 --> 00:26:36,896
we can negotiate.

422
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:41,480
I really cherish talents.

423
00:26:41,480 --> 00:26:43,559
Sorry, I can't join the Junda team.

424
00:27:03,000 --> 00:27:04,279
Stop following me.

425
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,440
You can go back. Your work is over.

426
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:09,599
According to the plan I made for you before,

427
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:12,160
you are left with only the choice
to return to Ruifeng.

428
00:27:23,640 --> 00:27:25,200
Let go.

429
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:26,200
Give me a moment.

430
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:28,079
Listen to me, okay?

431
00:27:32,119 --> 00:27:33,184
First, let me go.

432
00:27:43,599 --> 00:27:45,680
A girl holding a boy's hand on the street.

433
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,880
Is it something you should do?

434
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,400
I, I didn't mean that.

435
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,880
This is something a boy should do.

436
00:27:54,692 --> 00:27:59,744
<i>♫ The rose left fragrance ♫</i>

437
00:27:59,744 --> 00:28:04,832
<i>♫ The sunset left glow ♫</i>

438
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:10,208
<i>♫ Your departure ♫</i>

439
00:28:12,704 --> 00:28:15,960
<i>♫ Only left invisible wounds ♫</i>

440
00:28:15,960 --> 00:28:17,920
You said Shen Xi went with Mobai today?

441
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:21,200
<i>Yes, it was Shen Xi who prevented Mobai
from going to Junda.</i>

442
00:28:22,039 --> 00:28:23,960
Wei, you relieve Mofei's worries.

443
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:25,696
I'll try to persuade him.

444
00:28:25,696 --> 00:28:27,040
I know.

445
00:28:27,759 --> 00:28:29,279
You really care about Mobai.

446
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:32,059
Jiang Wei, it's about time.

447
00:28:32,059 --> 00:28:33,120
You have to tell me the truth.

448
00:28:34,759 --> 00:28:35,808
On the day of the match,

449
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:37,960
did Mofei bribe the drivers?

450
00:28:38,920 --> 00:28:40,599
<i>Or is there a hidden story?</i>

451
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:43,440
It's Mr. An.

452
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,480
<i>Miss Mofei was afraid of making a fuss</i>

453
00:28:45,119 --> 00:28:46,440
<i>without clarification.</i>

454
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,839
Once it gets out that the seniors
at Ruifeng are fighting,

455
00:28:49,359 --> 00:28:50,432
it will be more troublesome.

456
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:52,400
<i>She didn't think
Mobai would believe her either.</i>

457
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,260
I knew it.

458
00:28:54,260 --> 00:28:56,160
Okay, leave the rest to me.

459
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:05,960
Mobai did not sign a contract with Junda.

460
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:08,599
It has always been a misunderstanding
between you siblings.

461
00:29:09,519 --> 00:29:10,624
It's time

462
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:12,928
to explain to Mobai.

463
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,799
Those who understand
wouldn't need explanations.

464
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,799
Those who don't understand
wouldn't benefit from more explanations.

465
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:23,960
You and Mobai are exactly alike.

466
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:25,856
Stubborn.

467
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,200
It's Qingming Festival again.

468
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:31,160
Do you want to call him
to ask if he's coming back?

469
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:32,960
No need.

470
00:29:34,599 --> 00:29:36,480
Just help me prepare the things.

471
00:29:46,759 --> 00:29:48,440
I'm going back to work at Ruifeng tomorrow.

472
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,136
That's good.

473
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,340
Sorry about just now.

474
00:29:53,340 --> 00:29:55,319
I think I ruined your contract signing.

475
00:29:56,039 --> 00:29:57,559
How could it be?

476
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:58,559
If it weren't for your reminder,

477
00:29:58,559 --> 00:30:00,240
I wouldn't have thought they'd go so low.

478
00:30:03,039 --> 00:30:04,260
I absolutely won't cooperate with people

479
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:05,319
who don't respect fair competition.

480
00:30:06,400 --> 00:30:07,480
Thank you for helping me make this judgment.

481
00:30:09,759 --> 00:30:13,200
Did you decide not to sign with Junda today?

482
00:30:14,039 --> 00:30:15,104
Nope.

483
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,279
I didn't really want to go back to Ruifeng.

484
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:22,000
If Junda is alright in all aspects,

485
00:30:22,519 --> 00:30:23,519
why wouldn't I sign?

486
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:31,400
I don't know what plans you have next,

487
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:33,720
but you should hurry.

488
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,480
By the time you want
to enter the Super Grand Prix,

489
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,079
you may have missed your prime age.

490
00:30:43,079 --> 00:30:44,839
Do you think I can enter the Super Grand Prix?

491
00:30:45,839 --> 00:30:47,559
You won the Formula B championship.

492
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:50,400
As long as you can win the Formula A
championship for two consecutive years,

493
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:54,319
you will have enough points
and a chance to participate in the selection.

494
00:30:55,359 --> 00:30:56,480
That's how my brother did it.

495
00:30:57,279 --> 00:31:00,119
Your brother entered the Formula A
championship at the age of 19.

496
00:31:00,680 --> 00:31:02,960
I'm still running in Formula B at 24.
Can that compare?

497
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:09,120
Age is important, but it's not absolute.

498
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:13,119
I don't think your skills are worse
than my brother's.

499
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:16,880
In some areas, you may be even better.

500
00:31:21,599 --> 00:31:23,079
I didn't expect you to appreciate me so much.

501
00:31:26,720 --> 00:31:28,440
That's why I urged you to return to Ruifeng.

502
00:31:31,119 --> 00:31:33,240
I don't want to see you waste your talent.

503
00:31:35,720 --> 00:31:37,000
But Chen Mofei is different from you.

504
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,072
Why do you say that?

505
00:31:40,319 --> 00:31:41,519
In Chen Mofei's eyes,

506
00:31:42,599 --> 00:31:44,000
everything has a clear price.

507
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:46,079
Keep what is valuable

508
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,799
and discard what is not.

509
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:49,824
She has always been like this.

510
00:31:50,359 --> 00:31:51,559
She doesn't think
there's anything wrong with it.

511
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:54,960
I don't think Miss Mofei is like this.

512
00:31:56,759 --> 00:31:57,792
Perhaps,

513
00:31:58,359 --> 00:31:59,759
because of her position,

514
00:32:01,119 --> 00:32:02,640
she's compelled to do certain things.

515
00:32:03,640 --> 00:32:05,519
Since I joined Ruifeng,

516
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,359
the company has faced many difficulties.

517
00:32:10,559 --> 00:32:11,640
But Miss Mofei is very persistent.

518
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:13,536
No matter how difficult,

519
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:16,440
she always delivers
the highest quality products.

520
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:21,119
People without dreams can't do this.

521
00:32:27,759 --> 00:32:28,800
You're right.

522
00:32:31,319 --> 00:32:32,319
Maybe it's a dream.

523
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,359
But after all, it's her dream.

524
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,920
She never took my dream into consideration.

525
00:32:40,119 --> 00:32:41,920
She doesn't think I can drive well, either.

526
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:43,920
She doesn't think I have talent.

527
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:46,460
Even if she wants me to go back now,

528
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:47,720
it's only because she's forced to
by the circumstances.

529
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:50,559
Does Miss Mofei know

530
00:32:51,559 --> 00:32:52,608
you think this way?

531
00:32:53,200 --> 00:32:54,279
What difference does it make
whether she knows or not?

532
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:56,416
Nothing can change.

533
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,040
I don't care.

534
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:06,319
I don't think family members
should be like this.

535
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,440
If you have something to say,

536
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:11,759
you need to speak up in time.

537
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,119
When you have no opportunity,

538
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:17,599
you will regret it deeply.

539
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:45,400
Chen Mobai, did you hear what I said?

540
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,980
Before in the race,

541
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:50,200
the one who bribed others was not Mofei
but An Yunlong.

542
00:33:56,640 --> 00:33:57,920
Why didn't she explain to me herself?

543
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:03,640
Chen Mobai, with your temper,
would you even listen if she explained?

544
00:34:04,359 --> 00:34:05,620
I don't understand Mofei's issues.

545
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:08,320
I don't want to comment on the grudges
between you two, either.

546
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:10,840
But if you were misunderstood,

547
00:34:11,639 --> 00:34:12,820
how would you feel

548
00:34:12,820 --> 00:34:14,760
if Mofei unjustly scolded you in public?

549
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:20,680
This is the analysis Shen Xi
made for you before.

550
00:34:20,680 --> 00:34:22,139
I don't think it's needed now. I'll discard it.

551
00:34:22,139 --> 00:34:23,232
You dare?

556

<i>I don't want to see you waste your talent.</i>

557
00:35:03,639 --> 00:35:04,736
Come in.

558
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,039
You're back. Come sit.

559
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:18,599
Still don't want to transfer?

560
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:23,559
I heard you were the one
who screwed up his thing with Junda.

561
00:35:25,639 --> 00:35:27,159
He didn't really want to go to Junda.

562
00:35:28,559 --> 00:35:29,880
Actually, if he doesn't join them,

563
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,736
he won't come back either.

564
00:35:37,159 --> 00:35:38,176
What happened?

565
00:35:39,559 --> 00:35:40,672
I wonder

566
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:43,679
what you were thinking

567
00:35:46,840 --> 00:35:47,872
when you disbanded his racing team back then.

568
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:55,904
Have you heard

569
00:35:56,599 --> 00:35:57,760
of the story of Icarus?

570
00:35:59,199 --> 00:36:01,400
Yes, Greek mythology.

571
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:06,199
Icarus flew towards the sun
with wings made of wax.

572
00:36:07,519 --> 00:36:10,039
Because the temperature was too high,
the wings melted.

573
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,512
In the end, he

574
00:36:13,119 --> 00:36:14,208
fell down.

575
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,240
I've always thought

576
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:18,800
that for Chen Mobai, racing is like that sun.

577
00:36:21,079 --> 00:36:22,920
He just has a pair of wax wings.

578
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,400
He's constantly chasing.

579
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:30,440
Maybe the previous races
gave him a lot of confidence.

580
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,780
Others also think he is very talented

581
00:36:32,780 --> 00:36:34,320
and capable of flying high and far.

582
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:41,280
All I think is

583
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:45,519
one day he will lose those wings

584
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,928
and fall from a great height.

585
00:36:51,159 --> 00:36:52,400
Have you ever thought

586
00:36:53,840 --> 00:36:54,944
maybe

587
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,719
Chen Mobai is that sun?

588
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:01,239
There are times when problems are unsolvable.

589
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,679
We can change our approach to solving them.

590
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:05,920
Perhaps you can trust him more

591
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:07,639
and he can trust you more.

592
00:37:08,159 --> 00:37:09,184
Understood.

593
00:37:10,159 --> 00:37:11,719
If there's nothing else, you can leave first.

594
00:37:12,599 --> 00:37:13,600
I'm working.

595
00:37:51,199 --> 00:37:52,224
It was an accident.

596
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,320
Don't blame yourself too much
after all these years.

600
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:10,368
It's evident

601
00:39:11,159 --> 00:39:12,440
Mobai is much stronger than before.

602
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:15,379
It's been so many years.

603
00:39:15,379 --> 00:39:16,559
Do you still plan to go on hiding it from him?

604
00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:42,848
You've come to see my brother?

605
00:39:49,119 --> 00:39:50,208
My mom is here too.

606
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:04,480
When I was nineteen,

607
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:07,920
Chen Mofei was driving

608
00:40:10,199 --> 00:40:11,232
and had a car accident.

609
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,320
<i>Doctor, how's my mom?</i>

610
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:29,119
<i>We've missed the best time for rescue.</i>

613
00:41:09,760 --> 00:41:10,800
It must have been tough.

614
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,216
You asked me last time

615
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:15,119
what it was to leave no regrets.

616
00:41:19,239 --> 00:41:21,039
I don't know how to make up
for the regrets of that day.

617
00:41:22,320 --> 00:41:24,440
They say racing is a sport against time.

618
00:41:25,719 --> 00:41:26,800
So every time

619
00:41:28,079 --> 00:41:30,039
I will step on the accelerator regardless

620
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,624
to see

621
00:41:35,880 --> 00:41:37,519
if I can regain those three minutes

622
00:41:40,280 --> 00:41:41,400
or the results would be different.

623
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,000
Do you want me to drive you home?

624
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,119
I want to stay here a little longer.

625
