[Self-Control Versus Losing Control]

16
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:48,080
The distance between the top three is so close.

17
00:01:48,080 --> 00:01:49,880
The chances of overtaking them
are pretty low, right?

18
00:01:49,880 --> 00:01:50,920
It's the seventh turn ahead.

19
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,840
We need to slow down for the second-gear turn.

20
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:57,719
Chen Mobai, during the seventh turn,

21
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:00,480
overtake Chami directly
and don't downshift to second gear.

22
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:01,739
The turn is quite acute.

23
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:04,799
Going into it in third gear,
won't it throw him off the track?

24
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,120
Chen Mobai.

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,759
Go ahead. I'm listening.

26
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:11,239
You've practiced this turn
many times in the simulator.

27
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,639
You'll be fine. Don't worry.

28
00:02:13,728 --> 00:02:14,800
Understood.

29
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:17,300
We're reaching the first sharp turn
of the race, the seventh turn.

30
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,940
Everyone's slowing down.

31
00:02:18,940 --> 00:02:21,520
But it seems Chen Mobai is not.

32
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,360
Yes, he didn't slow down.

33
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,580
Exiting the turn now.

34
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,960
Chen Mobai has overtaken Chami.

35
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:30,120
This is a completely unconventional move

36
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,040
and it's really risky.

37
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,620
But we've just seen the result.

38
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,560
Chen Mobai is now in third place,

39
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:37,199
hot on the heels of Lu Yunhao and Mitsui Taku.

40
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:40,479
I believe this is the start
of Chen Mobai's counterattack.

41
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:43,460
We can understand the pressure on Chen Mobai.

42
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:46,360
He just entered Formula A league
as a Formula B champion

43
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:48,240
and he has Shen Xi by his side,

44
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:49,699
the former Super Grand Prix engineer.

45
00:02:49,699 --> 00:02:51,199
He shoulders great expectations,

46
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:53,280
but he still hasn't proven himself.

47
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
Chen Mobai crossed turn seven in four-gear.

48
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,200
On his home field Linhai…

49
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,620
How did he do this?

50
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,712
Needless to say…

51
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,840
Not bad.

52
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,479
The rankings haven't changed for now.

53
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:05,919
Mitsui Taku, Lu Yunhao,
and Chen Mobai in that order.

54
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:08,200
Chen Mobai of Ruifeng Race Team

55
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,599
unlawfully impeded Filipino contender Chami
during the overtake,

56
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,280
and has been penalized to relinquish the lead.

57
00:03:14,960 --> 00:03:17,000
- Well, after this penalty…
- What?

58
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:18,519
The top three now are

59
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:21,020
Mitsui Taku, Lu Yunhao, and Chami.

60
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:23,200
Chen Mobai has fallen to fourth place again.

61
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,560
Does Referee Park have any hobbies?

62
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:28,512
He likes to play golf.

63
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:34,860
When the race is over, invite him to Japan.

64
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:38,040
We'll go to my private course

65
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,160
and have a great time.

66
00:03:40,160 --> 00:03:41,439
Sure.

67
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,580
What? What's going on?

68
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:45,380
How come our normal overtaking is a violation?

69
00:03:45,380 --> 00:03:46,920
What? What violation?

70
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,416
Obviously, they used their money power.

71
00:03:48,416 --> 00:03:49,439
I'll go make an appeal.

72
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,496
Listen to me.

73
00:03:51,776 --> 00:03:54,560
Chen Mobai, don't mind it.

74
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,199
You were in a good state. Keep it up.

75
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,352
Rest assured.

76
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,479
The more they do this,

77
00:04:02,479 --> 00:04:04,639
the more I want to win this championship
fair and square.

78
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:09,719
Try to hold the inside line,

79
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,800
and you should have a chance
to take back the position.

80
00:04:12,512 --> 00:04:13,599
Alright.

81
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,140
Inside line. Inside line.

82
00:04:15,140 --> 00:04:17,620
Chen Mobai overtakes Chami
again from the inside line,

83
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:19,079
going back to the third place.

84
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:21,419
Although the penalty in the race
is unfavorable for Chen Mobai,

85
00:04:21,419 --> 00:04:24,220
it seems that he has not been affected at all.

86
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,920
Instead, his fighting spirit has been ignited.

87
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:29,540
The situation in the next part
is the same as the previous two races.

88
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:33,220
[Live]
Mitsui Taku, Lu Yunhao, and Chen Mobai

89
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:36,600
are forming a three-way struggle,
with further distance from the group behind.

90
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,300
He's been like this since he was in school.

91
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,600
The more people suppress him,

92
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:41,120
the more he will fight back.

93
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:44,199
He's a lot more mature now.

94
00:04:45,639 --> 00:04:47,519
He is a racer with the demeanor of a general.

95
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:51,279
It seems that he has fulfilled
his agreement with that engineer.

96
00:04:53,639 --> 00:04:56,120
[Live]
There are only two laps left in the race.

97
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:58,880
While Chen Mobai and Lu Yunhao are entangling,

98
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,399
Mitsui Taku expanded his leading advantage.

99
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,419
Lu Yunhao is using his signature tactics

100
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:11,000
with a clear aim,

101
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,279
not to give Chen Mobai

102
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,439
any opportunity to overtake him.

103
00:05:15,079 --> 00:05:16,859
Of course, the real winner of this tactic

104
00:05:16,859 --> 00:05:18,480
would be Mitsui Taku in front of him.

105
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:19,560
Why is Lu Yunhao doing this again?

106
00:05:24,319 --> 00:05:27,160
Lu Yunhao is making every effort
to defend Chen Mobai.

107
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,019
If Mitsui Taku successfully defends his title,
he needs to thank Lu Yunhao properly.

108
00:05:31,019 --> 00:05:34,000
Lu Yunhao, you've got nothing new.

109
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,959
This game should be over.

110
00:05:37,079 --> 00:05:38,399
Monkey, data.

111
00:05:38,399 --> 00:05:39,488
Here it comes.

112
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:45,440
Chen Mobai, you have to listen to me now.

113
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:46,528
I'm listening.

114
00:05:46,528 --> 00:05:49,600
At the turn fourteen,
brake 100 meters in advance.

115
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,399
What? Brake early?

116
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:53,900
If I brake early, won't I have
even less chance?

117
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,008
Trust me.

118
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,800
We have arrived

119
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,279
at the most challenging turn fourteen
of the entire race track.

120
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,819
This is a sharp turn with a large angle

121
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:04,600
and also the angular turn
leading to the straight track.

122
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:08,000
A rapid turn will bring
a strong lateral acceleration,

123
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,560
so the drivers must master the balance well.

124
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,959
A very subtle mistake

125
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:14,439
can easily throw you off the track.

126
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,439
This kind of curve clearly benefits the leader,

127
00:06:18,079 --> 00:06:19,720
as everyone generally adopts

128
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:21,399
a relatively safe strategy to make the turn.

129
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,579
Overtaking here is indeed

130
00:06:23,579 --> 00:06:24,839
a very dangerous thing to do.

131
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,620
However, for Chen Mobai who is lagging behind,

132
00:06:27,620 --> 00:06:29,560
there is no better opportunity next,

133
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:32,439
so I guess he might try something.

134
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,560
What's going on with Chen Mobai?

135
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:43,839
He's actually decelerating early.

136
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:47,660
Wait! Lu Yunhao's car suddenly lost control

137
00:06:47,660 --> 00:06:48,959
and deviated from the track.

138
00:06:48,959 --> 00:06:50,839
Here comes Chen Mobai's chance again.

139
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:54,680
Indeed, Chen Mobai overtook him.

140
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,960
This is really wonderful.

141
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:59,680
That's just how it is on the race course,
everything is so unpredictable.

142
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,000
You never know what will
happen in the next second.

143
00:07:02,848 --> 00:07:03,872
The wind's changed.

144
00:07:04,439 --> 00:07:05,839
The reaction force is greater now.

145
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:09,759
Whoever speeds up in the last turn will drift.

146
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,560
Lu Yunhao saw Chen Mobai slow down,

147
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:14,624
so he accelerated.

148
00:07:46,839 --> 00:07:48,940
Lu Yunhao, listen to me.

149
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:50,439
You must run Chen Mobai off the road.

150
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:52,360
Keep him away from Mitsui.

151
00:07:53,248 --> 00:07:54,340
Are you serious?

152
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:56,220
If I do that, I could crash too.

153
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:57,312
Never mind that.

154
00:07:57,959 --> 00:08:01,080
Your job now is to attack Chen Mobai

155
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,112
and force him off the track.

156
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,112
What are you doing?

157
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,340
You can't give him that kind of order.

158
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,519
He's not even on your team.

159
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,552
Even if he was,

160
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:15,079
it's illegal. He'll be disqualified.

161
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:19,160
Foul is still a reasonable tactic.

162
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:23,560
Lu Yunhao, our teams are in an alliance.

163
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,859
One team's victory is a victory for both.

164
00:08:25,859 --> 00:08:28,180
So the lagging car must sacrifice itself.

165
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:29,216
Do you understand?

166
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,079
If you were ahead,

167
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:32,960
I would be ordering Mitsui to support you.

168
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:36,448
Understood.

169
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,800
Lu Yunhao is constantly closing
the gap with Chen Mobai.

170
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,000
It's clear he will not give up.

171
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,600
You make me sick.

172
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:50,440
If you don't respect the sport,
you don't deserve to be here.

173
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,664
Sorry, Mr. Lin.

174
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:57,120
But, it's important to win.

175
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:00,960
We're done.

176
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,440
Inside line, Lu Yunhao
is forcing his way inside.

177
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:07,720
But Chen Mobai's positioning is very good,

178
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,120
blocking almost every angle.

179
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:11,519
Lu Yunhao's tactical choice

180
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:13,320
is really a bit too aggressive.

181
00:09:14,879 --> 00:09:16,560
Is Lu Yunhao making a forceful pass?

182
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,399
In that case, he's very likely

183
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:20,120
to collide with Chen Mobai.

184
00:09:24,159 --> 00:09:26,679
As we can see, Lu Yunhao's tactics failed.

185
00:09:26,679 --> 00:09:28,479
His car went out of control and off the track.

186
00:09:28,479 --> 00:09:30,559
His race ended prematurely this time.

187
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:33,840
Tell me what happened.

188
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,840
Sorry, I was nervous.

189
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:37,840
I messed up.

190
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:45,799
Chen Mobai, I'll help you once this time.

191
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:52,500
The race has entered the final stage.

192
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:55,519
The new challenger and the experienced veteran
are equally matched.

193
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,039
[Live]

194
00:09:56,039 --> 00:09:58,040
Chen Mobai's offensive momentum is very strong

195
00:09:58,040 --> 00:10:00,080
but Mitsui's defense is also top-notch.

196
00:10:00,679 --> 00:10:02,219
Chen Mobai's chances to overtake him

197
00:10:02,219 --> 00:10:04,899
are only the last two corners up front.

198
00:10:04,899 --> 00:10:06,159
The opportunity must be seized.

199
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,599
Chen Mobai is closely following Mitsui Taku.

200
00:10:08,599 --> 00:10:11,280
At the penultimate corner
before the finish line

201
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,219
he decisively used close combat.

202
00:10:13,219 --> 00:10:16,500
Mitsui Taku could not turn at high speed
and had to slow down.

203
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:19,040
Now the distance between the two cars
is only a hair's breadth.

204
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,096
It's so intense.

205
00:10:20,799 --> 00:10:23,520
Mitsui, you must hold on.

206
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:24,600
Once we hit the straight track,

207
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:25,664
with our power unit,

208
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:28,200
Chen Mobai won't have any chance.

209
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:30,200
You can't be defeated.

210
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,440
Takano has to be the Formula A champion.

211
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:35,399
Don't worry, I won't let you down.

212
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:38,500
Chen Mobai is still sticking
close to Mitsui Taku,

213
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:40,039
looking for an opportunity to attack.

214
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,720
Now it's time to see Mitsui Taku defend.

215
00:10:47,639 --> 00:10:50,240
Chen Mobai chose the outside line.

216
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,279
He can go faster.

217
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:55,424
But Mitsui Taku predicted

218
00:10:55,424 --> 00:10:56,448
Chen Mobai's tactics

219
00:10:56,448 --> 00:10:57,720
and blocked the route in time.

220
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:01,440
It's a pity that Chen Mobai
couldn't complete the overtaking.

221
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:03,679
There's only the last corner left.

222
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,840
Xi, it seems quite difficult for Mobai
to overtake from either side.

223
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:10,432
I have to catch him off guard.

224
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,440
Mitsui Taku is an experienced racer.

225
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,080
It's easy for him to guess your intention.

226
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,360
I have to take that chance.

227
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,639
It's the last corner. Trust your intuition.

228
00:11:33,080 --> 00:11:34,800
The decisive moment is coming.

229
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:36,440
Chen Mobai is gearing up.

230
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:39,240
He seems to be preparing
for the final overtake.

231
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,559
Which side will he choose?

232
00:11:45,312 --> 00:11:46,320
The outside track.

233
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:48,940
Chen Mobai once again chose the outside line.

234
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:50,016
Here comes his chance.

235
00:11:51,136 --> 00:11:52,224
This is a psychological battle.

236
00:11:52,224 --> 00:11:53,280
As expected.

237
00:11:53,280 --> 00:11:54,799
Chen Mobai made a beautiful feint

238
00:11:54,799 --> 00:11:56,200
and tried to overtake from the inside.

239
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,700
But Mitsui Taku is nonetheless experienced,

240
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:01,679
who defended immediately.

241
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:03,700
This is so exciting.

242
00:12:03,700 --> 00:12:06,360
The competition of top Asian formula.

243
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:08,620
What could be more regretful

244
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:10,112
than a nearly winning hero?

245
00:12:10,112 --> 00:12:12,160
Chen Mobai missed the last corner.

246
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,599
On the last straight track
before the finish line,

247
00:12:14,599 --> 00:12:16,400
the chance for him to surpass Mitsui Taku again

248
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,320
is very slim.

249
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:21,759
Thank you for your help these days.

250
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,960
Please be proud.

251
00:12:25,879 --> 00:12:26,944
We still won.

252
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:31,424
It's not over yet.

253
00:12:33,039 --> 00:12:34,320
Shen Xi.

254
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,039
Can we use the mode you designed now?

255
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:42,159
Shen Xi, can I?

256
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:50,279
The wind is too strong now.

257
00:12:51,399 --> 00:12:52,480
It's too risky.

258
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:55,680
Are we going to accept defeat?

259
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:56,704
We have a good hand.

260
00:12:56,704 --> 00:12:58,240
Not playing all the best cards is a real pity.

261
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:00,064
Shut up. Listen to Shen Xi.

262
00:13:04,759 --> 00:13:05,792
There will be more opportunities later.

263
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,720
Do you want Xi to wait for you on the spot?

264
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:32,200
I want to tell her with enough confidence

265
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,448
that I'll take her to the Super Grand Prix.

266
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,976
I'm sorry, Shen Xi.

267
00:13:44,679 --> 00:13:45,840
I have to win today.

268
00:13:49,159 --> 00:13:50,240
Chen Mobai.

269
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,559
I said no. Do you hear me?

270
00:13:57,960 --> 00:13:59,420
Chen Mobai's car is suddenly speeding up.

271
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:01,399
Is he choosing a desperate fight?

272
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,020
Such fighting spirit is indeed admirable,

273
00:14:04,020 --> 00:14:07,200
but it seems difficult to change
the impending outcome.

274
00:14:09,399 --> 00:14:10,496
Chen Mobai.

275
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:14,360
You promised me.

276
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,399
You promised to listen to me. You promised.

277
00:14:22,559 --> 00:14:23,648
Chen Mobai.

278
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:27,759
Chen Mobai.

279
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:30,624
Xi, I don't think

280
00:14:32,452 --> 00:14:33,988
Mobai will listen.

281
00:15:31,399 --> 00:15:32,519
After I win this race,

282
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,624
I have something to say to you.

283
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,440
Have you heard of the paradox

284
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:39,480
of emotion and rationality?

285
00:15:54,559 --> 00:15:55,584
I know.

286
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:58,879
Engineers are merely the blacksmiths
who forge weapons.

287
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,120
The driver is the soldier who wields the sword.

288
00:16:04,960 --> 00:16:06,159
But at this moment,

289
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,320
I felt the blade.

290
00:16:09,679 --> 00:16:12,000
I felt the insolvable paradox

291
00:16:12,799 --> 00:16:14,080
between the driver and the engineer.

292
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:17,360
The race has come to the last moment.

293
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,399
Could there be any surprises?

294
00:16:27,559 --> 00:16:31,060
Wait a minute! Chen Mobai.
He is actually closing up on Mitsui Taku

295
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,560
on the straight road,

296
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,720
and he's still accelerating.

297
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:42,360
It's like his car suddenly has wings

298
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:44,240
and is riding the wind.

299
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,840
This is absolutely amazing.

300
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:49,779
I take back what I said just now.

301
00:16:49,779 --> 00:16:51,919
This game is full of surprises.

302
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:54,039
Let's wait for the result together.

303
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,020
He won! He won!

304
00:17:00,020 --> 00:17:01,640
Chen Mobai crossed the line first.

305
00:17:01,640 --> 00:17:03,040
Chen Mobai won.

306
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
Chen Mobai is the champion.

307
00:17:06,976 --> 00:17:08,039
What's going on?

308
00:17:08,039 --> 00:17:11,160
Chen Mobai's car hasn't slowed down
even after the finish line.

309
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:17,240
It seems to be some kind of malfunction.

310
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,480
It seems that Chen Mobai is having
a hard time controlling his car.

311
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:35,119
The field needs to handle
this accident urgently.

312
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:38,720
Let's hope that the driver
Chen Mobai will be safe.

Chen Mobai defeated

with a 0.06-second advantage.

Since Shen Chuan,

329
00:19:38,840 --> 00:19:40,040
this is the first Chinese racer

330
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:42,960
to win the championship in Formula A racing.

331
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,759
This honor belongs to Ruifeng

332
00:19:46,359 --> 00:19:47,960

Chen Mobai won the championship. He won.

342
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,000
He adjusted the angle of the rear wing

343
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:49,079
and chose speed

344
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,119
over grip force.

345
00:20:52,119 --> 00:20:53,799
In this wing condition,

346
00:20:54,519 --> 00:20:55,519
he could have been killed.

347
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,848
It's all or nothing.

348
00:21:06,279 --> 00:21:07,360
He's crazy.

349
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,720
So awesome.

350
00:21:11,119 --> 00:21:12,192
He wants to prove

351
00:21:13,279 --> 00:21:14,368
that he can become her sea.

352
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,579
I'm impressed.

353
00:21:23,579 --> 00:21:24,960
And thank you for letting me

354
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,079
watch such a game, such a great win.

355
00:21:27,799 --> 00:21:31,328
I agree that the ability
and spirit of Ruifeng prove

356
00:21:32,240 --> 00:21:36,039
that they are indeed a company
worth investing in.

357
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:39,559
I'm so glad that we could reach an agreement.

358
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,799
Mr. Grasso, Mr. Cheng.

359
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,640
My vision never failed me.

360
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,160
Now, watch Ruifeng turn the tide.

361
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,480
Thank you.

362
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,448
He won.

363
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:04,319
Perhaps I was wrong.

364
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:08,064
You should stay

365
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:10,480
and go to the Super Grand Prix with him.

366
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,480
I can't go with him.

367
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:17,664
Why?

368
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:22,880
Before today, I made a bet with myself

369
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:25,960
to see if I could prove in this match

370
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:28,288
that he and I

371
00:23:28,799 --> 00:23:29,952
could find

372
00:23:29,952 --> 00:23:32,096
that balance between rationality and emotion.

373
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:35,880
And just now, I realized

374
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:39,200
that our problem was never him.

375
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:43,264
It's me.

376
00:23:50,799 --> 00:23:53,880
I've lost the professional judgment
that an engineer should have.

377
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,680
Today, I almost cost him the championship.

378
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,079
If I become a hindrance to him

379
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,200
and make him struggle,

380
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:12,160
he will only be further
and further away from his dream.

381
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:19,104
Rationality and emotion,

382
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:21,920
safety and speed.

383
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:24,896
They are always contradictory.

384
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:29,344
This is normal.

385
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,248
I can't hold him back.

386
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,032
Xi.

387
00:24:37,319 --> 00:24:38,680
This isn't your fault.

388
00:24:42,680 --> 00:24:44,440
He has already made too many sacrifices for me.

389
00:24:48,759 --> 00:24:49,799
He worked so hard.

390
00:24:51,839 --> 00:24:53,079
It wasn't easy for him to get to today.

391
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,220
I cannot let all his efforts go to waste

392
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,359
because of me.

393
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:14,319
I think I should go.

394
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:21,119
I think I should leave.

395
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,759
Ladies and gentlemen.

396
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:51,839
All these are sponsored by Miss Mofei.

397
00:25:53,519 --> 00:25:56,059
She said there will be

398
00:25:56,059 --> 00:25:57,900
a big fireworks display outside in a while

399
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:01,039
that she has spent a fortune on.

400
00:26:01,759 --> 00:26:03,640
Thank you, Miss Mofei.

401
00:26:06,319 --> 00:26:10,100
She said we have worked hard these days

402
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:11,160
and she won't come to make trouble.

403
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:15,799
We can all continue to drink, eat,

404
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,000
and dance.

405
00:26:30,848 --> 00:26:31,900
Drink!

406
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:34,020
According to what you said,

407
00:26:34,020 --> 00:26:35,140
I shouldn't be here either.

408
00:26:35,140 --> 00:26:36,279
You're different.

409
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:39,400
You're not here on behalf of the company.

410
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:41,599
You're here as my…

411
00:26:44,519 --> 00:26:47,232
My, my friend.

412
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:49,440
Let's dance. Come on.

413
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,776
Let's go.

414
00:26:53,359 --> 00:26:54,680
No more. That's it.

415
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,459
- Qianqian, try some of this.
- Thanks.

416
00:26:57,459 --> 00:26:59,220
- And this. Try this too.
- That's enough. Thanks.

417
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,880
That's more than enough.
Is it a bit inappropriate

418
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,819
for me to be here?

419
00:27:03,819 --> 00:27:05,480
What's not appropriate?

420
00:27:05,480 --> 00:27:07,200
You have contributed so much to our team.

421
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,160
Isn't that so?

422
00:27:09,160 --> 00:27:11,584
If not for you, we wouldn't
have been so motivated.

423
00:27:11,584 --> 00:27:12,820
Right, Chubby?

424
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:14,519
Yes, Xu Gong misses you a lot. You know?

425
00:27:16,079 --> 00:27:17,559
What did you say?

426
00:27:17,559 --> 00:27:19,920
What he meant was that we all miss you.

427
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,899
All of us.

428
00:27:21,899 --> 00:27:25,440
Why didn't Mobai and Xi come today?

429
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:27,880
Why are you so ignorant?

430
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:30,280
They are enjoying some quality time.
Don't worry about them.

431
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:32,740
That's right. they are in a
do-not-disturb mode right now.

432
00:27:32,740 --> 00:27:34,319
Let's drink. Come on, cheers!

433
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:36,660
Your mouth looks like Santa Claus.

434
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:38,140
Wipe it, really.

435
00:27:38,140 --> 00:27:39,232
Cheers!

436
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,559
You missed the press conference this afternoon.

437
00:27:51,839 --> 00:27:53,240
Now you're not attending the party, huh?

438
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:55,456
What are you doing here all alone?

439
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:10,816
This is our

440
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,008
first championship together.

441
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:24,119
Not "ours".

442
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:25,184
This championship

443
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:27,616
was brought back by you alone.

444
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:42,160
Are you mad at me for not listening to you

445
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:44,576
on the field?

446
00:28:56,720 --> 00:28:58,240
I had no other choice in today's match.

447
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,608
I had to win.

448
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,128
I'm sorry.

449
00:29:07,640 --> 00:29:08,704
You don't have to apologize.

450
00:29:09,799 --> 00:29:10,799
Luckily, you didn't listen to me.

451
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:13,600
Or we would have lost.

452
00:29:20,759 --> 00:29:22,640
Why do I feel like you're not very happy?

453
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,176
I…

454
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:37,519
I have something to tell you.

455
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:38,759
Let me speak first.

456
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,160
I told you before the match,

457
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,360
that after I win,

458
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,280
I have something to tell you.

459
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:56,992
Shen Xi,

460
00:29:59,759 --> 00:30:01,279
I don't want you to just be my engineer.

461
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:05,880
I also want you to be my girlfriend.

462
00:30:08,799 --> 00:30:10,319
Not just a girlfriend,

463
00:30:12,279 --> 00:30:14,279
but someone I'm willing to spend all my time,

464
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:17,312
all my energy,

465
00:30:19,880 --> 00:30:20,920
and every instinct to love.

466
00:30:47,160 --> 00:30:50,160
What a good moment to express feelings.

467
00:30:50,839 --> 00:30:53,359
Some people shouldn't waste
such a good opportunity.

468
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,819
Qianqian, let me ask you something.

469
00:31:04,819 --> 00:31:05,824
Go ahead.

470
00:31:05,824 --> 00:31:06,912
Do you have a boyfriend?

471
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:14,039
Liu Qianqian, do you have a boyfriend?

472
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:17,920
I … like… you!

473
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:21,079
It's not the right direction.

474
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,496
Well…

475
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,559
How about I sing a song for everyone?

476
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:40,300
Sing first, sing first.

477
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,720
Alright, let's sing.

478
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:42,816
Sing a song.

479
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:46,239
It's so awkward, so awkward.

480
00:31:46,239 --> 00:31:47,319
Sing a song.

481
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:52,039
The speed of a firework ascending

482
00:31:52,839 --> 00:31:54,319
is 44 meters per second.

483
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:56,759
But it disperses even faster.

484
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:00,000
At three hundred million meters per second.

485
00:32:03,319 --> 00:32:04,759
That's the speed of light

486
00:32:06,279 --> 00:32:08,519
and also the speed limit of objects in nature.

487
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,160
The ground limit is the race car
of the Super Grand Prix.

488
00:32:19,759 --> 00:32:22,319
It's the second most precise
machinery next to rockets.

489
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,799
Humans use it to compete with the wind

490
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:30,200
and find the balance
between propulsion and resistance.

491
00:32:41,960 --> 00:32:43,799
What I want to tell you is

492
00:32:47,079 --> 00:32:48,440
it seems that I can't

493
00:32:50,960 --> 00:32:53,039
find the balance between us.

494
00:32:55,839 --> 00:32:56,896
So,

495
00:33:00,519 --> 00:33:02,680
I can't be your girlfriend,

496
00:33:07,480 --> 00:33:08,480
nor can I

497
00:33:10,839 --> 00:33:12,200
be your engineer anymore.

498
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,264
Why?

499
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:22,239
When two people are together,

500
00:33:22,239 --> 00:33:23,960
they should give each other positive feedback.

501
00:33:24,839 --> 00:33:26,160
I don't want to be your hindrance.

502
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:27,960
You have never been a hindrance to me.

503
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,680
You are my entire motivation.

504
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,720
Do you still remember that paradox?

505
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:02,559
Today's game is the case in point.

506
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:07,640
If I continue to stay by your side,

507
00:34:08,559 --> 00:34:10,560
I will only cost you your dream of these years.

508
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:12,440
Tell me the probability
of solving this paradox.

509
00:34:13,536 --> 00:34:16,096
One in a thousand, one in ten thousand?

510
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:19,119
Even if there's the slightest chance,
I'd take it.

511
00:34:20,239 --> 00:34:21,360
I will find a way.

512
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,280
The reason it's called a paradox

513
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,760
is because it's unsolvable.

514
00:34:42,039 --> 00:34:43,072
However,

515
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,519
I already have my answer.

516
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:50,912
To leave me

517
00:34:53,519 --> 00:34:54,560
and go back to Markus with him?

518
00:35:11,679 --> 00:35:13,320
How do you think I should react right now?

519
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,079
Wishing you a safe journey

520
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,104
or begging you to stay?

521
00:35:30,559 --> 00:35:32,920
Wish me a safe journey.

522
00:35:46,119 --> 00:35:47,200
I wish you…

523
00:35:54,559 --> 00:35:55,616

00:37:47,808 --> 00:37:54,304
♫ My ultimate goal ♫

544
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,840
What's going on?

545
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,480
Where's my bag?

546
00:40:23,199 --> 00:40:24,384
I'll get it for you.

547
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:53,920
What are you doing?

548
00:40:55,648 --> 00:40:57,760
Replying to emails, I'm already two hours late.

549
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,959
Are you seriously dealing with emails now?

550
00:41:02,959 --> 00:41:04,079
Do you need anything else?

551
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:09,152
No, not really. I'll leave then.

552
00:41:19,119 --> 00:41:20,299
Actually, yesterday…

553
00:41:20,299 --> 00:41:21,400
What happened yesterday?

554
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:24,599
Nothing happened yesterday.

555
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,360
I'll go now.

556
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:32,544
Goodbye.

557
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,960
Zhao Yingning you're such a drunkard.

558
00:41:56,639 --> 00:41:57,696
It's true.

559
00:41:59,679 --> 00:42:01,400
Nothing happened yesterday.

560
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:04,160
You…

561
00:42:30,308 --> 00:42:34,788
♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫

562
00:42:36,708 --> 00:42:41,312
♫ The heart gradually silences ♫

563
00:42:42,692 --> 00:42:49,280
♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫

564
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,368
♫ I can't delete them ♫

565
00:42:55,428 --> 00:43:01,440
♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫

566
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:08,320
♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫

567
00:43:08,320 --> 00:43:16,768
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

568
00:43:17,604 --> 00:43:21,600
♫ Fading away ♫

569
00:43:22,756 --> 00:43:29,248
♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫

570
00:43:29,248 --> 00:43:35,616
♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫

571
00:43:37,092 --> 00:43:43,968
♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫

572
00:43:43,968 --> 00:43:48,320
♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫

573
00:43:48,320 --> 00:43:54,688
♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫

574
00:43:54,688 --> 00:44:01,440
♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫

575
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:08,768
♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫

576
00:44:08,768 --> 00:44:18,368
♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫
