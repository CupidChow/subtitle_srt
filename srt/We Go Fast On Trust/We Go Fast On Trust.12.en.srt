00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:24,799
a living encyclopedia.

183
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:28,039
Fifteen kilometers is indeed too short for you.

184
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,919
So run the extra miles of the earth first.

185
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:32,736
76 kilometers, okay?

186
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,919
Okay, as long as you can catch up with me,

187
00:13:38,679 --> 00:13:39,776
you can add as much as you want.

188
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:42,620
Is that what you said?

189
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:43,744
That's what I said.

190
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,176
I've caught up with you.

191
00:14:04,096 --> 00:14:05,216
I'll add another five kilometers.

192
00:14:05,759 --> 00:14:06,880
You really say to add and just add, huh?

193
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:09,480
I want to see where your endurance

194
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:11,456
limit lies.

195
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,600
Speed up,

196
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,919
or I'll add two more sandbags.

197
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:25,659
Are we also practicing swimming here?

198
00:14:25,659 --> 00:14:26,679
The pool is too small.

199
00:14:27,559 --> 00:14:29,320
This is not a practice. It's for you to relax.

200
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:32,864
Do you want to undress?

201
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:36,000
No, no, not really.

202
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,399
It's not appropriate during the day, is it?

203
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,519
Whatever, you go ahead and get in.

204
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,512
Okay.

205
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:52,720
It's too cold.

206
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:55,680
Wait a moment, please.

207
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,940
Yeah, yeah, add some hot water.

208
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:02,944
It's too cold.

209
00:15:09,799 --> 00:15:10,880
Pour it in.

210
00:15:18,279 --> 00:15:19,360
Ice? What for?

211
00:15:23,960 --> 00:15:26,520
Bathing in icy water after exercise
can constrict capillaries

212
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,720
and repair damaged muscles.

213
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:30,080
So you won't ache tomorrow

214
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:31,232
and you can continue training.

215
00:15:31,799 --> 00:15:32,920
It's just too cold.

216
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:35,080
How does it feel?

217
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,120
Like basking in spring breeze

218
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,784
or bathing in spring rain.

219
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,080
Doesn't it imply a bit of a romantic feeling?

220
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:45,560
Well, you're adding insult to injury.

221
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:46,840
I will settle this with you sooner or later.

222
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:50,759
How could I? I'm pretty envious of you.

223
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,840
Really?

224
00:15:53,840 --> 00:15:55,000
Why don't you get in too?

225
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,736
We're here.

226
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:27,648
Thank you.

227
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,336
I'll head back now.

228
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:37,376
Get some rest early.

229
00:18:02,519 --> 00:18:03,599
Come pick me up tomorrow.

230
00:18:06,599 --> 00:18:08,839
That way we can get to the team earlier
and improve efficiency.

231
00:18:13,279 --> 00:18:14,624
You're not willing?

232
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:17,319
I, I am willing.

233
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,240
Okay, okay.

234
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:21,000
Okay, see you tomorrow.

235
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:22,920
Okay, see you tomorrow.

236
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:54,440
We were looking forward
to the new official taking office with a bang.

237
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,119
As a result, everyone was carried away
without caution.

238
00:18:58,039 --> 00:18:59,319
I don't understand professional issues.

239
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:01,280
But

240
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:04,580
from the perspective of uniting the team,

241
00:19:04,580 --> 00:19:06,799
Shen Xi's method truly works.

242
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:10,039
I just want to know
if they really kissed or not.

243
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:11,960
They say they didn't.

244
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:13,799
But he was definitely thoughtful about it.

245
00:19:15,519 --> 00:19:18,272
Look, I told you I wouldn't tell you,
but you had to ask.

246
00:19:18,272 --> 00:19:19,279
After asking, you behave like this.

247
00:19:22,039 --> 00:19:23,200
Why can't I ask?

248
00:19:23,839 --> 00:19:25,459
He is my chosen marriage partner.

249
00:19:25,459 --> 00:19:27,279
I can't just let someone else take him away,
can I?

250
00:19:28,519 --> 00:19:29,720
Listen to me.

251
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:32,480
You are purely wasting time on Chen Mobai.

252
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:35,560
What's wrong? Do you think I,
Zhao Yingning, can't make it?

253
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:36,560
How am I worse than her?

254
00:19:36,560 --> 00:19:37,568
Not a bit worse.

255
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:39,328
But

256
00:19:39,839 --> 00:19:40,880
in this world,

257
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,680
all efforts

258
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,260
must be mutual to make sense.

259
00:19:46,260 --> 00:19:48,740
If the two of you are not on the same path,

260
00:19:48,740 --> 00:19:51,480
you will just diverge
and drift further and further apart.

261
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:55,820
How do you know
that they two are on the same path?

262
00:19:55,820 --> 00:19:56,960
I don't think necessarily.

263
00:19:59,488 --> 00:20:01,599
Here, I peeled these for you, you eat these.

264
00:20:10,039 --> 00:20:11,679
I just don't like things

265
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,960
that are easily attained.

266
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,176
Mobai.

267
00:20:27,319 --> 00:20:29,400
Mobai, I've been waiting
for you guys for a while.

268
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,200
What's wrong now?

269
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:33,060
Why does it seem like something major
happened every day?

270
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,160
Something big indeed happened.

271
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,440
Go, go, go. Let's go quickly.

272
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:38,720
Quick, quick.

273
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,272
How come you're here?

274
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:58,620
You broke the single lap record of Formula A.

275
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:01,500
It's fine to be a little proud.

276
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,680
But when doing something bad,

277
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,544
you should at least try to hide it.

278
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:08,928
What did I do?

279
00:21:10,039 --> 00:21:12,680
The two of you seem to be progressing smoothly.

280
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,480
Miss Zhao, did you misunderstand something?

281
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:34,539
Hao Yang, did you speak nonsense?

282
00:21:34,539 --> 00:21:36,779
Let me… I can explain.

283
00:21:36,779 --> 00:21:38,340
What are you explaining? Can you explain now?

284
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:39,640
I suddenly remember

285
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:43,720
everyone gets a pass
if you break the record of Mitsui Taku.

286
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:46,559
Didn't your team include her last time?

287
00:21:50,279 --> 00:21:52,060
The team fleet has parachuted a new engineer.

288
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,340
I, as an investor, want to try
where her abilities lie.

289
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,424
No problem, right?

290
00:21:56,279 --> 00:21:57,560
Aren't you masking your personal grudge?

291
00:21:57,560 --> 00:21:59,040
I suggest you,

292
00:21:59,040 --> 00:22:00,199
if it can't be changed,

293
00:22:00,199 --> 00:22:02,079
you'd better learn to accept it
like when you were a kid.

294
00:22:02,599 --> 00:22:04,160
It's fair like this, isn't it, Miss Shen?

295
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:06,240
Very fair.

296
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,416
I'm ready.

297
00:22:10,200 --> 00:22:11,200
You have some courage.

298
00:22:13,559 --> 00:22:15,680
I have one condition,
Chen Mobai can't participate.

299
00:22:16,839 --> 00:22:17,856
No problem.

300
00:22:18,359 --> 00:22:19,799
I will prove to you that I can do it.

301
00:22:21,319 --> 00:22:22,519
Okay, then let's begin.

302
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:24,448
Well,

303
00:22:29,319 --> 00:22:31,279
won't you ask for my opinion?

304
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:34,779
- You caused this, right?
- What?

305
00:22:34,779 --> 00:22:36,059
You caused all this fuss!

306
00:22:36,059 --> 00:22:37,440
You just watch the excitement.

307
00:22:40,079 --> 00:22:41,679
This is a test I specially brought in.

308
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:43,519
A question to test the team's technical level.

309
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:45,580
The track is not a garage.

310
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:46,920
It needs multiple tasks

311
00:22:46,920 --> 00:22:48,880
to be accurately and correctly completed
in a short time.

312
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,600
Whether or not it can be done

313
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,160
is a basic standard to test
whether a team is excellent or not.

314
00:22:54,519 --> 00:22:55,552
The first task,

315
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,640
assemble the engine parts.

316
00:22:59,559 --> 00:23:00,640
The second task,

317
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,020
assemble these mixed suspension parts

318
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:04,799
into four suspensions.

319
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,939
The third task,

320
00:23:06,939 --> 00:23:09,880
on the software level, complete the inspection
and debugging

321
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,079
of the program of the ECU.

322
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,319
Miss Zhao, we have done these tasks regularly.

323
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:17,952
How much time is there?

324
00:23:18,599 --> 00:23:20,340
The standard is an hour and a half.

325
00:23:20,340 --> 00:23:21,860
But I don't want to be too bullying.

326
00:23:21,860 --> 00:23:23,480
It can be relaxed for thirty minutes.

327
00:23:24,519 --> 00:23:25,699
With this process,

328
00:23:25,699 --> 00:23:28,680
it usually takes at least three or four hours.

329
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:29,799
Miss Zhao, you…

330
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:32,179
If you are testing Xi,

331
00:23:32,179 --> 00:23:35,200
why did you have to
bring us three weights with her?

332
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,240
Isn't this bullying Xi?

333
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,599
An engineer is the brain of a racing team

334
00:23:42,319 --> 00:23:43,759
and the brain should be responsible
for the whole body.

335
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:47,599
If you want to surrender now,
it's not too late.

336
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:53,088
One hour.

337
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:55,680
I've calculated it. We only need one hour.

338
00:23:56,256 --> 00:23:57,380
Two hours is too much.

339
00:23:57,380 --> 00:23:59,159
One hour? Well…

340
00:23:59,159 --> 00:24:02,319
Confidence is a good thing,
but let me be the bad guy here.

341
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,899
If you can't finish, you have to leave.

342
00:24:04,899 --> 00:24:06,279
Not even Chen Mobai can stop it.

343
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:08,128
No problem.

344
00:24:10,039 --> 00:24:11,072
Let's get started.

345
00:24:11,799 --> 00:24:12,839
Just do your best.

346
00:24:25,839 --> 00:24:28,179
Chubby eats so much normally.

347
00:24:28,179 --> 00:24:29,640
He's completely useless
when it comes to real work.

348
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,599
Why has Xu Gong gone to this state?

349
00:24:37,359 --> 00:24:38,368
Probably nervous.

350
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,359
When is it not okay to be nervous?

351
00:24:41,519 --> 00:24:42,920
You see Zhao Yingning and you're not nervous?

352
00:24:45,079 --> 00:24:46,208
That's true.

353
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:52,064
Xu Gong,

354
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,680
first clean, then categorize.

355
00:24:55,319 --> 00:24:56,340
And finally assemble.

356
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,319
He who wants to do good work
must first sharpen his tools.

357
00:24:58,319 --> 00:24:59,519
We'll win by taking our time.

358
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,360
Chubby, although there are a lot of components,

359
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:07,180
the suspension structure itself
is quite simple.

360
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:09,239
If you remember the torque of every screw,

361
00:25:09,239 --> 00:25:10,359
you can save a lot of time.

362
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:13,140
Different intake and exhaust settings

363
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,000
will affect the amount of fuel injection
and ignition angle.

364
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:17,759
You might as well download
the most commonly used settings as a reference.

365
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:22,640
Xu Gong, the screws in the corresponding parts

366
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:24,380
need to use the appropriate force

367
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:25,680
according to the overall torque and rigidity.

368
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:29,728
Chubby,

369
00:25:29,728 --> 00:25:31,104
remember to balance the aerodynamics.

370
00:25:32,079 --> 00:25:35,320
Monkey, don't forget about safety
when optimizing parameters.

371
00:25:35,320 --> 00:25:37,240
Control the air-fuel ratio
through engine calibration maps

372
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:39,720
and the oxygen concentration
sensor closed-loop.

373
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:45,504
Shall we go down?

374
00:25:47,119 --> 00:25:48,140
Let's keep observing for a while.

375
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:50,759
If we go down now,
it would be like adding fuel to the fire.

376
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,319
- Done.
- Done.

377
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,176
Done.

378
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,279
59 minutes and 55 seconds.

379
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:44,352
Amazing!

380
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,456
Looks like it was a false alarm.

381
00:26:50,599 --> 00:26:52,120
Xi is awesome.

382
00:26:52,120 --> 00:26:54,160
I declare, starting from today,

383
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:56,200
Xi is my little master now.

384
00:26:57,680 --> 00:26:58,752
Miss Zhao,

385
00:27:00,119 --> 00:27:01,216
that's not bad, right?

386
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,480
You did perform well today.

387
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:05,599
But whether you can take on the job,

388
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:07,240
I will keep observing.

389
00:27:08,440 --> 00:27:10,300
I grew up with Chen Mobai.

390
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,519
He is not so easy to tame.

391
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:14,880
Wait a minute, I am a driver, not an animal.

392
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,160
Why do you need to tame me?

393
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,839
Drivers don't need to be tamed by engineers.

394
00:27:20,039 --> 00:27:22,559
What's needed is cooperation
and the cultivation of tacit understanding.

395
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:26,464
Wait and see.

396
00:27:38,720 --> 00:27:40,120
But you should know

397
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:42,039
it's not so easy for me to give up what I want.

398
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:43,880
This time is no exception.

399
00:27:48,519 --> 00:27:51,240
This woman is calm on the surface.

400
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:53,640
There is danger lurking beneath.

401
00:27:58,359 --> 00:27:59,480
Everyone did well today.

402
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:02,280
What do you want to eat tonight? My treat.

403
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:05,419
Listen to Xi. Thanks to her to pass today.

404
00:28:05,419 --> 00:28:07,319
This must be decided by my little master.

405
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:10,720
Today is all your credit.

406
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,559
Your technical foundation is fine

407
00:28:13,119 --> 00:28:14,120
and you are very talented.

408
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:15,519
You must believe in yourself more.

409
00:28:17,559 --> 00:28:20,992
Little Master, what do you want to eat tonight?
You decide.

410
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,480
Sour fish soup it is.

411
00:29:02,839 --> 00:29:04,279
What's going on?

412
00:29:07,240 --> 00:29:08,720
The sun is rising in the west.

413
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,400
Chubby is reading a book.

414
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,359
Zhao Yingning's challenge was pretty good.

415
00:29:14,359 --> 00:29:16,079
Isn't this better than team building?

416
00:29:18,759 --> 00:29:21,799
You don't look at who the engineer is?

417
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:23,936
That's right.

418
00:29:30,480 --> 00:29:33,920
Alright, having good taste doesn't mean
you should always stare at her.

419
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:39,640
Chubby, stop reading. Stop reading.

420
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:43,119
Well, I can't be a drag on the team.

421
00:29:43,960 --> 00:29:45,056
Let me tell you,

422
00:29:45,759 --> 00:29:48,040
since we have a way
to break Mitsui Taku's record,

423
00:29:48,040 --> 00:29:50,079
regardless of which track we use in the future,

424
00:29:50,680 --> 00:29:52,560
breaking his record will be easy.

425
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,220
It's not only one lap in the formal race.

426
00:29:55,220 --> 00:29:56,768
You have to win several dozens of laps.

427
00:29:56,768 --> 00:29:57,920
I'm good with that.

428
00:29:57,920 --> 00:29:59,600
Alright, just let them practice.

After all, they also want to be like someone.

Stop it, stop it, be gentle, be gentle.

Ouch, ouch, you've spilled it all over me.

435
00:30:14,200 --> 00:30:15,200
Chen Mobai,

436
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:18,720

00:30:20,240 --> 00:30:21,640

What's wrong? What are you looking at?

00:30:52,759 --> 00:30:54,119
between Xi and Mobai now?

446
00:30:54,816 --> 00:30:55,860

this paper screen between them,

I'm afraid it will take them a week.

449
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:03,039
You are seriously underestimating your Mobai.

Did I miss something just now?

454
00:31:14,839 --> 00:31:17,040
Chubby, well, I bet three packs of ramen.

Well, what's wrong with them?

Come on, call out your most frequently used
racetrack map.

Just use the simulator?

458
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,480
I normally also play this simulator.

459
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,240
Are you afraid
I'm tired and suffering normally?

460
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:39,060
It's okay. Just say
what you want to train me on.

461
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,119
I won't argue.

There is no "and then". Just practice this.

with your eyes closed.

to complete the task.

00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:08,720
Nothing new. Just practice this.

Oh no. Do they need help?

the sour fish soup is delicious,
but you can't always eat it.

I've driven it countless times.

You don't understand. Grow your veggies.

544
00:37:46,260 --> 00:37:47,360
Shut up.

545
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:08,799
I don't like beans, Yang.

546
00:38:08,799 --> 00:38:09,920
Red bean rice.

547
00:38:10,559 --> 00:38:12,199
A cure for lovesickness.

548
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:14,480
Then I will eat it.

549
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:16,000
Nonsense. I'll weed your vegetables.

550
00:38:36,612 --> 00:38:36,964
[Pumpkin]

551
00:38:36,964 --> 00:38:41,568
[Red Bean]

552
00:39:27,844 --> 00:39:29,888
[Massive Gratification]

553
00:40:15,239 --> 00:40:16,288
Good morning.

554
00:40:17,559 --> 00:40:18,592
Morning.

555
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,952
Today,

556
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,599
could it still be practicing on a simulator?

557
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,760
There's no simulator practice today.

558
00:40:28,719 --> 00:40:29,960
Although you have made a lot of progress,

559
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,519
it still does not meet the standard.

560
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:35,168
Practice something else today.

561
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,824
So…

562
00:40:39,039 --> 00:40:40,199
There's a new training task.

563
00:40:41,440 --> 00:40:42,760
What kind of training is it?

564
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:43,800
You will know when you get there.

565
00:40:55,519 --> 00:40:58,239
Miss Xi, are you sure you want to do this?

566
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,920
I'm a bit worried.

567
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:06,464
What are you worried about?

568
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:10,599
I'm afraid his manly pride can't take it.

569
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:15,780
He can only become
a truly qualified Formula A driver

570
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:18,400
if he gets over this.

571
00:41:30,679 --> 00:41:32,280
Chen Mobai, no rule-breaking.

572
00:41:32,280 --> 00:41:34,119
The speed cannot exceed 20 mph.

573
00:41:42,679 --> 00:41:44,159
Uncle, are you a tortoise?

574
00:41:45,239 --> 00:41:47,639
Who are you calling a tortoise? Come back.

575
00:41:47,639 --> 00:41:49,000
What's going on?

576
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:51,599
Uncle, Uncle, can you do it?
If you can't do it, don't block the road.

577
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:52,640
I…

578
00:41:53,152 --> 00:41:54,272
So slow.

579
00:41:54,272 --> 00:41:55,599
You are so slow.

580
00:41:58,039 --> 00:41:59,136
Such a naughty kid.

581
00:41:59,840 --> 00:42:01,599
I think you want
to taste the bitterness of society.

582
00:42:11,880 --> 00:42:12,992
Are you alright?

583
00:42:13,719 --> 00:42:14,760
Don't cry, don't cry.

584
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,880
Don't be angry, okay?

585
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,679
Miss Xi, it's okay. I'll take care of it.

586
00:42:22,840 --> 00:42:24,519
Come on, come on.

587
00:42:25,199 --> 00:42:26,208
Slow down, okay?

588
00:42:27,320 --> 00:42:29,400
Stop crying, stop crying.

589
00:42:30,679 --> 00:42:32,219
Chen Mobai, you broke the rules.

590
00:42:32,219 --> 00:42:33,280
Why did you irritate him?

591
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:36,200
I just wanted to show him

592
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:38,119
what a proper overtaking looked like.

593
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:41,639
But, then I lost a bit of control.

594
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:45,472
Fifteen mph.

595
00:42:53,476 --> 00:42:57,956
♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫

596
00:42:59,876 --> 00:43:04,480
♫ The heart gradually silences ♫

597
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:12,448
♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫

598
00:43:12,448 --> 00:43:17,536
♫ I can't delete them ♫

599
00:43:18,596 --> 00:43:24,608
♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫

600
00:43:24,608 --> 00:43:31,488
♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫

601
00:43:31,488 --> 00:43:39,936
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

602
00:43:40,772 --> 00:43:44,768
♫ Fading away ♫

603
00:43:45,924 --> 00:43:52,416
♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫

604
00:43:52,416 --> 00:43:58,784
♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫

605
00:44:00,260 --> 00:44:07,136
♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫

606
00:44:07,136 --> 00:44:11,488
♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫

607
00:44:11,488 --> 00:44:17,856
♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫

608
00:44:17,856 --> 00:44:24,608
♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫

609
00:44:24,608 --> 00:44:31,936
♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫

610
00:44:31,936 --> 00:44:41,536
♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫
