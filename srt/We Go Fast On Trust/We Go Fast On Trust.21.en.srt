[If we have a same goal,
we are destined to go together]

16
00:02:12,520 --> 00:02:13,639
Just go. I'm too ashamed to see you.

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,976
You can't burn this.

18
00:02:18,976 --> 00:02:20,000
You can't!

19
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,120
This is your first championship.

20
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:22,800
Just leave me alone.

21
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:38,159
Mom will be sad to see you like this.

22
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,439
Mom will be sad to see me like this?

23
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:51,960
She should have known for a long time

24
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:54,199
that how self-righteous her son is.

25
00:02:56,759 --> 00:02:58,000
How arrogant he is.

26
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,639
And how detestable he is.

27
00:03:05,319 --> 00:03:06,319
Mom has always been

28
00:03:08,384 --> 00:03:09,472
proud of you.

29
00:03:12,479 --> 00:03:13,599
What's there to be proud of?

30
00:03:22,639 --> 00:03:23,744
It's been hard on you.

31
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,879
For all these years, you've taken the blame

32
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,960
for causing Mom's death.

33
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:34,240
It was me

34
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:37,159
who killed Mom.

35
00:03:39,919 --> 00:03:40,992
It was me.

36
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,320
And it was me

37
00:03:49,479 --> 00:03:51,240
who put the blame on you.

38
00:03:55,039 --> 00:03:56,840
It was me who had been denying reality.

39
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,784
And always,

40
00:04:03,319 --> 00:04:04,416
always hiding.

41
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:06,816
It was all my fault.

42
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:17,600
It's not your fault.

43
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,720
It's no one's fault.

44
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,096
Sister.

45
00:05:18,848 --> 00:05:19,904
I'm tired.

46
00:06:11,079 --> 00:06:13,199
After Mom's accident, Mobai moved out.

47
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,080
Dad hasn't been in good shape

48
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:16,240
so he's basically in the hospital.

49
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,336
So now,

50
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,879
I live alone here.

51
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,920
He moved out,

52
00:06:27,079 --> 00:06:28,240
probably because

53
00:06:29,279 --> 00:06:30,480
there were too many memories here.

54
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:33,879
And if he continued to live here,

55
00:06:34,959 --> 00:06:37,000
it would remind him of painful memories.

56
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,056
Yeah.

57
00:06:42,976 --> 00:06:44,032
I know.

58
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,448
Look at this.

59
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,800
He really liked racing.

60
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,639
That time,

61
00:07:15,639 --> 00:07:17,720
he did it himself after watching a cartoon.

62
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:22,120
He said he wanted to drive the car so fast

63
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:23,200
that it could fly,

64
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:26,040
so that Mom would know he was the best.

65
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,392
Mobai.

66
00:07:32,736 --> 00:07:33,760
What are you doing?

67
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,160
What are you up to, you little brat?

68
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,319
I'm going to teach you a lesson.

69
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,056
Stop running.

70
00:07:41,056 --> 00:07:42,112
Get over here.

71
00:07:43,072 --> 00:07:44,096
Come here.

72
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,900
I'll make it hurt.

73
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,519
- Wenmao, Wenmao.
- Come over here.

74
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,520
What are you doing?

75
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,160
Why are you so angry at the child?

76
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:52,439
Look at my car. Look what he did.

77
00:07:52,439 --> 00:07:53,472
He drew on it.

78
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,260
You should ask the child why.

79
00:07:56,260 --> 00:07:57,620
Maybe he didn't mean to.

80
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,519
- I meant to do it.
- Listen to him.

81
00:07:59,519 --> 00:08:01,519
It took me a long time to draw this.

82
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,539
Mom, I'm sure I can drive the race car

83
00:08:04,539 --> 00:08:05,620
so fast in the future

84
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:07,360
that it flies,

85
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,700
and you'll see I'm better than anyone else.

86
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,199
- Great.
- Great how?

87
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:14,460
Today, I'll make you fly first. Come here.

88
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:16,720
Put down the broom. Come on.

89
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,360
- Stop running. Come here.
- Here, here.

90
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,320
It might have been
the start of his racing dream.

91
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,240
The kid who could only

92
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,320
draw wings on cars

93
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:51,279
can now actually fly.

94
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:56,879
Mom would be extremely happy to see it.

95
00:09:02,919 --> 00:09:04,080
I've always thought

96
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:07,519
that as long as my family can stay by my side,

97
00:09:09,639 --> 00:09:10,759
I can do anything.

98
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,200
I never thought about other options.

99
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:22,879
Maybe in life, you don't get to choose.

100
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:28,480
I know

101
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,720
I'm not fit as a good sister,

102
00:09:33,679 --> 00:09:34,919
but I really did my best.

103
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,712
Shen Xi.

104
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,799
You are the closest person

105
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,679
to Chen Mobai in this world.

106
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,120
He was lucky

107
00:09:55,879 --> 00:09:56,960
to meet you.

108
00:10:08,559 --> 00:10:09,559
So I want to say,

109
00:10:11,648 --> 00:10:12,672
please,

110
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,544
help him.

111
00:10:24,224 --> 00:10:25,312
I will.

112
00:14:00,768 --> 00:14:01,799
You are early.

113
00:14:02,679 --> 00:14:03,960
We're not ready yet.

114
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:08,416
What's all this?

115
00:14:10,919 --> 00:14:13,400
This picture is the start of your dream.

116
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:15,159
You wanted the race car
to be fast enough to fly.

117
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,440
And I've been studying the Wings of Wind,

118
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,639
hoping to create wings like the wind.

119
00:14:24,799 --> 00:14:27,480
The pursuit of breaking limits

120
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:29,039
is our shared dream.

121
00:14:30,039 --> 00:14:32,080
I hope neither of us will forget

122
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,440
where we came from

123
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,328
and we can travel together

124
00:14:38,112 --> 00:14:39,296
to the farthest goal.

125
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,440
So this is what you've been up to
for the past two days.

126
00:14:54,840 --> 00:14:56,480
Keeping it a secret from you

127
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:57,840
wasn't easy.

128
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:15,360
Why would you do this?

129
00:15:17,639 --> 00:15:20,080
How could these balloons possibly lift a car?

130
00:15:21,039 --> 00:15:22,879
Not everything can be accomplished,

131
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,100
but as long as we persist,

132
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:26,639
we can always hold on to hope, right?

133
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,640
I hope you can remember

134
00:15:37,640 --> 00:15:39,180
that kid inside you who wanted

135
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,399
to drive the race car until it could fly.

136
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,519
I hope you can believe in yourself

137
00:15:46,919 --> 00:15:48,039
and in our future.

138
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,240
The beauty that once resided in our hearts

139
00:15:53,039 --> 00:15:55,240
is the force that keeps us going, isn't it?

140
00:15:56,320 --> 00:16:00,807
♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫

141
00:16:01,856 --> 00:16:06,208
♫ The heart gradually silences ♫

Thank you.

147
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:39,000
Actually, it wasn't just me.

148
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:41,879
Each of us

149
00:16:42,759 --> 00:16:45,120
is working hard to remind you of that beauty,

150
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:47,968
including your family.

151
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:51,540
We all hope

152
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,679
that you can continue to pursue your dream.

♫ The wind is howling at high speed
near my ear ♫

156
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:15,880
You pulled me out of the abyss

157
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,136
telling me

158
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:20,992
that you believed in me

159
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:23,920
and in love.

160
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:26,519
I hope now

161
00:17:26,519 --> 00:17:28,160
you can take the love from all of us

162
00:17:30,079 --> 00:17:31,440
and your initial faith

163
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:34,119
to start over.

164
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,640
We will all be there for you.

165
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:44,119

What are you doing?! Chubby.

174
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:35,640
Chubby. Chubby!

175
00:18:37,856 --> 00:18:42,920
♫ My ultimate goal ♫

176
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:44,039
Everyone pulled several all-nighters

177
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,480
to prepare all this.

178
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,160
Yang, I think

179
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:58,599
we should count these as working hours.

180
00:19:00,519 --> 00:19:01,679
Can you speak properly?

181
00:19:01,679 --> 00:19:02,720
I am speaking properly.

182
00:19:03,839 --> 00:19:06,319
Monkey inhaled a bit of helium

183
00:19:06,319 --> 00:19:07,820
which changed

184
00:19:07,820 --> 00:19:10,140
the sound transmission medium in the air

185
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:11,920
and resulted in a slight change

186
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:13,079
in Monkey's voice.

187
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:15,584
Is my voice changing?

188
00:19:17,400 --> 00:19:18,680
You hear it, don't you?

189
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,440
How is it? Not bad, right?

190
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:29,440
Don't leave.

191
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:33,260
We are filling up these balloons

192
00:19:33,260 --> 00:19:36,064
with not air, but heartfelt sentiment.

193
00:19:36,064 --> 00:19:37,120
Why don't you join us?

194
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:39,160
Welcome, Miss Zhao! Welcome.

195
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:40,319
Welcome, Miss Zhao!

196
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:42,464
Chen Mobai.

197
00:19:44,096 --> 00:19:48,600
♫ Sunset light ♫

198
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,504
♫ Your departure ♫

199
00:19:55,904 --> 00:19:58,912
♫ Only left a transparent wound ♫

200
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:05,152
♫ Come back, my love ♫

201
00:20:06,176 --> 00:20:11,296
♫ In the sea of life, you are the only light ♫

202
00:20:12,864 --> 00:20:18,048
♫ Don't leave me in the endless night ♫

203
00:20:19,552 --> 00:20:22,016
♫ Being scratched by the fragments of memory ♫

204
00:20:22,944 --> 00:20:25,376
♫ Being scratched by the fragments of memory ♫

205
00:20:26,048 --> 00:20:28,960
♫ Sinking into the deep sea of memory ♫

206
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:31,319
I can't believe this happened.

207
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,720
For Chen Mofei,

208
00:20:35,359 --> 00:20:36,512
this is piling frost on the snow.

209
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,880
Really, it's one disaster after another.

210
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:44,416
What are you guys talking about?

211
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,240
Nothing. Just chatting.

212
00:20:48,759 --> 00:20:50,359
Drop the act. I heard you.

213
00:20:51,264 --> 00:20:52,288
What happened?

214
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:56,480
You were so downcast the past few days

215
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:57,519
and they didn't dare to tell you.

216
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:01,140
There was an accident with Maituo's battery,

217
00:21:01,140 --> 00:21:02,319
and because of public opinion,

218
00:21:02,319 --> 00:21:03,920
a large portion of Maituo's
pre-sale orders was canceled.

219
00:21:04,519 --> 00:21:06,920
She tried hard to find a Norwegian company
with cooperation needs

220
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:08,160
but they think that Ruifeng

221
00:21:08,759 --> 00:21:09,799
is not well-known,

222
00:21:09,799 --> 00:21:11,519
so they resolutely said no.

223
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:14,640
So my sister's many years of hard work

224
00:21:16,319 --> 00:21:17,472
are going to waste.

225
00:21:17,472 --> 00:21:18,640
Let's not get ahead of ourselves.

226
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,319
I will go back and talk to Mr. Cheng

227
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:23,960
and see if we can borrow the power of Weishi.

228
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,359
Yes, Mobai.

229
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,720
You were one step away
from your Super Grand Prix dream.

230
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,579
Fortunately, Markus was patient with you.

231
00:21:30,579 --> 00:21:32,279
Just hurry back, on a rocket.

232
00:21:33,279 --> 00:21:36,439
Or should I call and explain to them?

233
00:21:36,439 --> 00:21:37,504
That won't be necessary.

234
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:40,096
I will go back to Shanghai tomorrow

235
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:43,039
and solve the problem I caused.

236
00:21:47,960 --> 00:21:49,200
I will take care of the shop.

237
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:51,939
Miss Mofei and Miss Zhao
will take care of Ruifeng.

238
00:21:51,939 --> 00:21:53,160
You just forge ahead.

239
00:21:56,480 --> 00:21:57,568
Don't worry.

240
00:21:58,304 --> 00:21:59,328
I will be there with you.

241
00:22:07,279 --> 00:22:08,279
I used to think

242
00:22:09,839 --> 00:22:11,440
that the track was my only dream.

243
00:22:14,319 --> 00:22:15,839
But now, after going through so much,

244
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:20,119
I finally understand what kind of dreams
are more meaningful.

245
00:22:20,992 --> 00:22:23,604
[Shanghai Markus Asian Special Training Camp]

246
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,240
I'm really upset.

247
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:32,240
I think we really need to sue him, right?

248
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,920
I mean, it's unacceptable,

249
00:22:33,920 --> 00:22:34,976
what he was doing…

250
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:36,960
Excuse me.

251
00:22:38,599 --> 00:22:39,808
You are back.

252
00:22:41,728 --> 00:22:42,784
Mr. Stover.

253
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:44,672
Mr. Hasler.

254
00:22:45,759 --> 00:22:47,240
I'm sorry for going AWOL.

255
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:56,200
Now, as I told you,

256
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,319
we really need to sue him.

257
00:22:57,319 --> 00:22:59,480
It's unacceptable, what he did.

258
00:23:01,024 --> 00:23:02,144
What were they saying?

259
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:06,336
They said

260
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:08,839
they'd never seen
such a willful driver like you.

261
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:11,640
You breached the regulations
and left the training camp.

262
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:13,480
Markus wants you to compensate.

263
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:15,616
I have to compensate?

264
00:23:16,279 --> 00:23:17,344
How much?

265
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:19,712
Ten thousand?

266
00:23:19,712 --> 00:23:20,759
A million?

267
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:22,079
What?

268
00:23:22,079 --> 00:23:23,200
That's a lot.

269
00:23:24,256 --> 00:23:25,260
All I did was…

270
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,400
Xi is teasing you.

271
00:23:27,759 --> 00:23:30,440
They said they had never seen
a driver as willful as you,

272
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:32,128
but

273
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,000
your excellence makes them
willing to let that go.

274
00:23:40,096 --> 00:23:41,152
Let's get going.

275
00:23:49,519 --> 00:23:51,839
It's good to see you again, Bai.

276
00:23:52,599 --> 00:23:55,240
I think we should thank Dr. Shen

277
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,839
to have you here today,

278
00:23:57,559 --> 00:23:59,640
which proves that she's really

279
00:24:00,160 --> 00:24:05,419
helping you go through your…
inner difficulties, right?

280
00:24:05,419 --> 00:24:06,624
Yeah.

281
00:24:07,599 --> 00:24:08,704
I'm here

282
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:11,279
because of her.

283
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,119
Mr. Chen Mobai.

284
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:16,400
Our decision has not changed.

285
00:24:17,079 --> 00:24:20,079
Next season of the Wings of Wind

286
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,480
will be piloted by you.

287
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:23,599
This is to say

288
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:26,780
that you will represent Markus
racing on the world's stage

289
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,240
alongside with Lin Shaoqian, on the race track.

290
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,736
Chen Mobai.

291
00:24:34,279 --> 00:24:35,599
I have two congratulations to say.

292
00:24:36,599 --> 00:24:37,632
A,

293
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,680
you've made it into the Super Grand Prix.

294
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:41,792
B,

295
00:24:42,359 --> 00:24:43,360
that day,

296
00:24:44,599 --> 00:24:46,000
your score surpassed mine.

297
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,559
Thank you, sir.

298
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,799
Besides apologizing,

299
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:58,816
I must

300
00:24:59,519 --> 00:25:01,000
refuse this invitation.

301
00:25:02,079 --> 00:25:04,400
Why? Can you give me a reason?

302
00:25:05,319 --> 00:25:06,880
This is Formula S.

303
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:10,819
The hall of fame of racing.

304
00:25:10,819 --> 00:25:12,519
The elite club

305
00:25:13,599 --> 00:25:17,400
that only has twenty people in the world.

306
00:25:17,400 --> 00:25:19,240
The dream of any driver.

307
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:21,440
This is my dream.

308
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,319
But like you said,

309
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,519
I should thank Dr. Shen.

310
00:25:29,839 --> 00:25:31,079
She made me realize that my speed

311
00:25:31,079 --> 00:25:32,119
doesn't just belong to me.

312
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,279
I have the responsibility to carry more dreams.

313
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:39,799
So, I am going back to do something.

314
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:41,984
Mr. Stover.

315
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,059
Mr. Hasler.

316
00:25:44,059 --> 00:25:45,152
Lin Shaoqian.

317
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:46,799
Thank you for letting me

318
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,640
stand in the doorway.

319
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,464
From here,

320
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:57,920
the view is beautiful.

321
00:26:03,519 --> 00:26:04,920
I'll never forget it.

322
00:26:07,119 --> 00:26:08,192
Maybe one day,

323
00:26:09,024 --> 00:26:10,048
I will

324
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,608
see it again.

325
00:26:23,559 --> 00:26:25,920
Dr. Shen, I don't understand.

326
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,359
He wants to stay in Formula A?

327
00:26:32,128 --> 00:26:33,184
I think

328
00:26:34,359 --> 00:26:35,680
he's got another plan.

329
00:26:38,319 --> 00:26:40,680
He's not gonna stay in F A next season.

330
00:26:55,759 --> 00:26:58,319
You've made up your mind
to leave with him, right?

331
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,759
But I should apologize to you.

332
00:27:06,200 --> 00:27:08,079
I know that you have been
appealing for two full years

333
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,200
just for me to come back.

334
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:15,488
What I want

335
00:27:16,319 --> 00:27:17,440
is your real happiness.

336
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:24,920
Will you be a little disappointed in me?

337
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:29,000
Nick will probably be disappointed too.

338
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,160
Don't worry.

339
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:34,200
The Super Grand Prix is not going anywhere.

340
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:37,640
Markus has been around for a hundred years.

341
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,559
They will be here

342
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:43,079
until you've finished what you want to do.

343
00:27:44,128 --> 00:27:45,216
So will I.

344
00:27:52,319 --> 00:27:53,400
I will always be waiting for you.

345
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,104
Thank you, Shaoqian.

346
00:28:03,584 --> 00:28:04,704
For you,

347
00:28:06,079 --> 00:28:07,104
and for Chuan,

348
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:10,279
I'm going to stick to this path till the end.

349
00:28:19,616 --> 00:28:20,672
Well then,

350
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:23,520
I am leaving.

351
00:28:25,152 --> 00:28:26,304
Xi.

352
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:34,839
Think of it as a goodbye.

353
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:19,079
When I was 22,

354
00:29:20,359 --> 00:29:21,400
I went to Markus,

355
00:29:22,368 --> 00:29:23,456
and met Chuan,

356
00:29:25,519 --> 00:29:26,559
and the girl next to him,

357
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,000
who loves ice cream.

358
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:32,279
Her name is Shen Xi.

359
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,279
I had something to say to you from the start.

360
00:29:41,599 --> 00:29:43,839
But, I felt

361
00:29:44,400 --> 00:29:45,640
there might be just one chance.

362
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,200
So the timing,

363
00:29:50,688 --> 00:29:51,808
the place,

364
00:29:52,319 --> 00:29:53,440
and even the wording,

365
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:55,720
had to be perfect.

366
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:01,880
So I kept on waiting and thinking.

367
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:07,960
At 24, at 26,

368
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,240
finally, I decided.

369
00:30:12,400 --> 00:30:13,504
But then,

370
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,240
Chuan suddenly left.

371
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:20,599
And then, you left too.

372
00:30:24,960 --> 00:30:26,720
The timing and location were all wrong.

373
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:33,960
But later, I realized that I

374
00:30:34,720 --> 00:30:35,839
had missed my chance.

375
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:41,632
But it doesn't matter.

376
00:30:43,359 --> 00:30:45,400
But at least, I want to tell you,

377
00:30:47,079 --> 00:30:48,759
that everything I did,

378
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,119
I'm sure it was all for you.

379
00:31:06,464 --> 00:31:07,552
Goodbye.

380
00:31:25,984 --> 00:31:27,104
Farewell.

381
00:31:28,839 --> 00:31:30,440
My girl who loves ice cream.

382
00:31:44,039 --> 00:31:46,079
Thank you, Shaoqian.

383
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:00,920
Is this seat taken?

384
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:12,256
What are you doing here?

385
00:32:16,359 --> 00:32:18,079
There are many engineers in Markus.

386
00:32:19,799 --> 00:32:20,896
But I'm all you've got.

387
00:32:22,559 --> 00:32:23,799
You once said,

388
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:26,000
that you can do many things for loved ones.

389
00:32:27,799 --> 00:32:28,880
I've made up my mind.

390
00:32:29,839 --> 00:32:31,319
There is no confusion in my heart.

391
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,839
Be it a paradox or any difficulty,

392
00:32:35,839 --> 00:32:37,319
whichever path you choose,

393
00:32:39,359 --> 00:32:40,640
I will be with you all the way.

394
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,562
♫ I fall ♫

395
00:32:49,562 --> 00:32:53,568
♫ Towards the direction you left ♫

396
00:32:53,568 --> 00:32:57,984
♫ I embrace the fragments of memory ♫

397
00:32:59,168 --> 00:33:02,176
♫ Believing that you are still waiting for me ♫

398
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:05,039
Thank you for everything you have done for me.

399
00:33:11,097 --> 00:33:14,560
♫ Come back, my love ♫

400
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:21,248
♫ In the sea of life, you are the only light ♫

401
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:27,712
♫ Don't leave me in the endless night ♫

402
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,460
Mobai said he was on his way back

403
00:33:49,460 --> 00:33:50,528
and asked me where you were.

404
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,319
Didn't Hao Yang say he went to Shanghai?

405
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,799
Could it be that he knows Ruifeng's situation?

406
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,559
Miss Zhao. Mr. Cheng. How did it go?

407
00:34:04,680 --> 00:34:05,680
There has been some progress.

408
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,880
Anderson agreed to make another call with you.

409
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,680
Hello, everyone

410
00:34:13,680 --> 00:34:14,720
from Ruifeng.

411
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:19,159
This morning, I received a call from Weishi,

412
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,519
and it was quite a surprise to me.

413
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:24,720
Our partner

414
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:26,199
is making a deal like that.

415
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,719
It's not a good way.

416
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:31,260
Mr. Anderson, I'm sorry.

417
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:34,199
We've never, ever wanted
to violate the competition.

418
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:37,159
But we do want to show you

419
00:34:37,159 --> 00:34:38,800
that Ruifeng is promising

420
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:42,520
that even an investment company

421
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:45,320
is willing to endorse it at a critical moment.

422
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,039
Mr. Cheng, Ms. Zhao.

423
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:52,180
can we agree that Ms. Chen is saying

424
00:34:52,180 --> 00:34:55,039
that Weishi is guaranteeing for Ruifeng?

425
00:34:59,968 --> 00:35:01,039
Business-wise,

426
00:35:01,679 --> 00:35:03,459
Ruifeng proved themselves

427
00:35:03,459 --> 00:35:04,920
trustworthy to Weishi.

428
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,456
Okay.

429
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,760
If like that, I agree

430
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,560
to give you 30%

431
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:16,039
of the deal to give Italian for Ruifeng.

432
00:35:19,679 --> 00:35:20,832
Mr. Anderson,

433
00:35:20,832 --> 00:35:22,859
does it refer to the import

434
00:35:22,859 --> 00:35:25,359
of the entire vehicle of Maituo?

435
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:26,740
Of course not.

436
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,239
My vision never changed.

437
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:31,840
The electric car without an
international reputation

438
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,599
will not have any market in Norway.

439
00:35:36,239 --> 00:35:37,800
Your part of the order

440
00:35:37,800 --> 00:35:39,480
will only be responsible

441
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,640
for OEM.

442
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,760
It's not fair.

443
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:48,660
It means that we use our equipment
to build cars for you

444
00:35:48,660 --> 00:35:50,559
and put on your brand logo?

445
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:54,080
It's called reality.

446
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:57,020
But you will get a tangible
benefit to help you through

447
00:35:57,020 --> 00:36:00,559
this difficult time. Isn't that
what you desperately need at the moment?

448
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:03,340
This is my bottom line.

449
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:05,199
Moreover, I can only

450
00:36:05,199 --> 00:36:08,220
give the best condition for the sake of Weishi.

451
00:36:08,220 --> 00:36:10,920
Unless Ruifeng's electric car

452
00:36:10,920 --> 00:36:13,480
is recognized by the world overnight,

453
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:15,800
this matter will no longer be discussed.

454
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,159
There will be no further discussion.

455
00:36:19,679 --> 00:36:24,519
You think about it. If you have
any questions, please reply to me.

456
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,272
Goodbye.

457
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,800
It's indeed humiliating.

458
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:30,641
But 30% of the order,

459
00:36:32,119 --> 00:36:33,119
even for OEM services,

460
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:34,840
should yield a considerable profit, right?

461
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,300
Yes, and if we can do it well,

462
00:36:37,300 --> 00:36:38,719
we can even discuss long-term cooperation.

463
00:36:39,936 --> 00:36:41,056
This is a major issue.

464
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,399
I need to discuss this with the Chairman.

465
00:36:43,399 --> 00:36:44,500
Chairman,

466
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,220
the situation now is that

467
00:36:46,220 --> 00:36:48,660
our domestic and international sales
are severely restricted

468
00:36:48,660 --> 00:36:50,579
and we face the risk of losing cash flow.

469
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:51,840
Whether the electric vehicle
is worth it or not,

470
00:36:51,840 --> 00:36:53,080
I won't discuss it anymore.

471
00:36:53,080 --> 00:36:54,480
The biggest reality

472
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:55,599
in front of us

473
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:57,199
is no funding and no orders.

474
00:36:58,639 --> 00:37:00,980
Sorry, I, I am a bit anxious, Chairman.

475
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:01,984
Now,

476
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:04,768
I think we

477
00:37:05,632 --> 00:37:06,656
should accept it.

478
00:37:07,456 --> 00:37:08,512
We must accept it.

479
00:37:09,039 --> 00:37:10,840
Chairman, I agree with Mr. An.

480
00:37:11,679 --> 00:37:13,960
The most important thing
for us now is to survive.

481
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:17,984
Fei,

482
00:37:19,168 --> 00:37:20,256
what do you think?

483
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:25,059
Miss Mofei, I know we've been treated unfairly.

484
00:37:25,059 --> 00:37:27,700
But before we can make a name out of ourselves,

485
00:37:27,700 --> 00:37:29,639
a temporary compromise is inevitable.

486
00:37:34,304 --> 00:37:35,424
Come in.

487
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:41,680
What are you doing here?

488
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,159
Ruifeng is in trouble.

489
00:37:43,159 --> 00:37:44,239
I'm Ruifeng's spokesperson,

490
00:37:45,559 --> 00:37:46,688
and she is my engineer.

491
00:37:47,424 --> 00:37:48,519
We are both duty-bound.

492
00:37:49,664 --> 00:37:50,752
We have a proposal.

493
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,040
What proposal do you have?

494
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,144
Let's hear it.

495
00:37:55,680 --> 00:37:56,736
Racing.

496
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:00,700
Your race car is a fuel car.

497
00:38:00,700 --> 00:38:02,719
Its promotional value
for electric cars is limited.

498
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:06,519
Miss Mofei, Chen Mobai
is referring to Super Formula E.

499
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:09,800
This race involves various auto manufacturers

500
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,880
who create their own electric race cars.

501
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:15,840
Yes.

502
00:38:18,039 --> 00:38:19,679
If we, Ruifeng, participate in the race

503
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:21,840
with our own technology

504
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:23,936
and achieve good results,

505
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:26,280
even stand on the championship podium,

506
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,179
it would be big news that shocks the world

507
00:38:29,179 --> 00:38:31,239
and the electric car industry.

508
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:33,760
And it's held in Spain this year.

509
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:36,159
All of Europe will be paying attention.

510
00:38:39,584 --> 00:38:40,704
I disagree.

511
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:44,159
Didn't you win the chance
to go to the Super Grand Prix?

512
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,559
Miss Mofei, we

513
00:38:49,320 --> 00:38:51,119
have officially turned down Markus's offer.

514
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,560
If you swap races at this point,

515
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:56,040
all your previous efforts will be wasted.

516
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:57,088
What are you going to do?

517
00:38:57,800 --> 00:38:58,980
I'm putting it on pause

518
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,039
to get through this crisis.

519
00:39:03,039 --> 00:39:04,360
But no matter on which track,

520
00:39:06,239 --> 00:39:07,599
isn't our goal the same,
to strive for the championship?

521
00:39:08,519 --> 00:39:10,760
I wanted to enter the Super Grand Prix
to prove that I can,

522
00:39:12,039 --> 00:39:13,039
to prove that Chinese people can.

523
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,960
You developed Maituo
with the highest standards,

524
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:19,280
also to let the world see Ruifeng's cars,

525
00:39:19,968 --> 00:39:21,039
Ruifeng's electric cars,

526
00:39:21,719 --> 00:39:22,960
and Chinese electric cars

527
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:25,920
are not inferior
to those world-class ones, right?

528
00:39:28,039 --> 00:39:29,679
As long as we stand on that award platform,

529
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:31,920
what you want and what I want

530
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:33,568
can both be achieved.

531
00:39:36,736 --> 00:39:37,856
Besides,

532
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:40,880
protecting the company

533
00:39:40,880 --> 00:39:42,599
is also the duty I should

534
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,544
fulfill anyway.

535
00:39:50,400 --> 00:39:51,480
Well said.

536
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:54,260
We can't just focus

537
00:39:54,260 --> 00:39:56,320
on the little benefits others give us

538
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,496
and provide

539
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,159
OEM services for other brands.

540
00:40:02,719 --> 00:40:04,039
What can we hope for?

541
00:40:04,039 --> 00:40:05,559
Should we just muddle along

542
00:40:06,199 --> 00:40:07,264
on the petty profit?

543
00:40:08,559 --> 00:40:09,632
For so many years,

544
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,400
they have been suppressing us.

545
00:40:12,719 --> 00:40:13,728
What they want

546
00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:16,079
is for us to make the low-end,

547
00:40:16,079 --> 00:40:18,159
and they can produce the high-end products.

548
00:40:19,119 --> 00:40:20,200
The more so,

549
00:40:20,200 --> 00:40:22,120
the more we have to stand up.

550
00:40:22,120 --> 00:40:25,159
As Chinese, we have the strongest backbone.

551
00:40:31,639 --> 00:40:33,079
Despite the difficulties,

552
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,559
the Race Team should get ready

553
00:40:36,119 --> 00:40:37,899
to shine on the racecourse,

554
00:40:37,899 --> 00:40:39,140
to make the country proud,

555
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:41,159
and to bring honor to our company.

556
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,120
As for the issue

557
00:40:43,120 --> 00:40:44,419
the issue of ' flow

558
00:40:44,419 --> 00:40:45,536
I'll think of something.

559
00:40:46,159 --> 00:40:47,800
It's settled, then.

560
00:40:48,679 --> 00:40:50,559
Mr. Chairman, what other options
do we have now?

561
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,119
I can ask the financial institutions
to pledge my shares

562
00:40:55,679 --> 00:40:57,260
and it should be able to hold out

563
00:40:57,260 --> 00:40:58,539
until the day of the game.

564
00:40:58,539 --> 00:40:59,920
- Dad.
- Enough.

565
00:41:00,960 --> 00:41:03,020
Without the determination
to cut off all means of retreat,

566
00:41:03,020 --> 00:41:04,679
we won't achieve anything.

567
00:41:09,679 --> 00:41:10,920
I saw some comments on the internet

568
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:12,768
and someone said

569
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:15,000
your rejecting Markus's offer
and coming back to Ruifeng

570
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,599
means you are a dream-chasing

571
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:19,239
ambitious young man.

572
00:41:23,760 --> 00:41:24,992
What do you think?

573
00:41:26,528 --> 00:41:27,616
Am I ambitious?

574
00:41:28,544 --> 00:41:29,728
What do I think?

575
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:38,280
I'm sorry, Sis,

576
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,392
about Mom.

577
00:41:43,392 --> 00:41:44,719
Stop saying that.

578
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,039
It wasn't anyone's fault.

579
00:41:49,679 --> 00:41:51,000
I've been such a jerk before.

580
00:41:52,896 --> 00:41:53,984
I was wrong.

581
00:41:55,559 --> 00:41:56,840
Despite what you did before,

582
00:41:58,519 --> 00:41:59,679
you're always my brother,

583
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,920
and we are a family.

584
00:42:17,639 --> 00:42:18,688
Actually,

585
00:42:22,679 --> 00:42:24,000
I've always owed you

586
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,392
an apology.

587
00:42:30,880 --> 00:42:32,032
For all these years,

588
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:35,459
I've been stopping you

589
00:42:35,459 --> 00:42:36,760
from doing what you wanted

590
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,039
in the name of protection and love.

591
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:45,504
I'm sorry.

592
00:42:54,836 --> 00:42:59,316
♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫

593
00:43:01,236 --> 00:43:05,840
♫ The heart gradually silences ♫

594
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:13,808
♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫

595
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:18,896
♫ I can't delete them ♫

596
00:43:19,956 --> 00:43:25,968
♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫

597
00:43:25,968 --> 00:43:32,848
♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫

598
00:43:32,848 --> 00:43:41,296
♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫

599
00:43:42,132 --> 00:43:46,128
♫ Fading away ♫

600
00:43:47,284 --> 00:43:53,776
♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫

601
00:43:53,776 --> 00:44:00,144
♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫

602
00:44:01,620 --> 00:44:08,496
♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫

603
00:44:08,496 --> 00:44:12,848
♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫

604
00:44:12,848 --> 00:44:19,216
♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫

605
00:44:19,216 --> 00:44:25,968
♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫

606
00:44:25,968 --> 00:44:33,296
♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫

607
00:44:33,296 --> 00:44:42,896
♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫
