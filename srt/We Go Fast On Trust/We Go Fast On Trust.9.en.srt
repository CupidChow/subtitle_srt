15

Do you deliver documents between
the engineering department and the team?

16
00:01:47,019 --> 00:01:48,468
Yes.

17
00:01:48,468 --> 00:01:52,280
<i>[Trust is Our Common Subject]</i>
Don't they want someone from our department to do it?

18
00:01:53,139 --> 00:01:55,719
I thought you don't do field work.

19
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:59,780
But I need to be clear with you.

20
00:01:59,780 --> 00:02:04,140
It's going to take time off work and there's no overtime pay.

21
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,984
Don't you mind?

22
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:10,110
Somebody has to do this.

23
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:12,084
Alright.

24
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,020
Jie, print this out for Mr. An and deliver it tomorrow.

25
00:02:20,020 --> 00:02:21,624
Okay.

26
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:32,680
Isn't this the document that
engineering department gave the team?

27
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:34,624
Well, I guess I should hurry up
and deliver it to Mr. Mobai.

28
00:02:34,624 --> 00:02:39,419
Wait. Miss Qiao has arranged Shen Xi to handle this.

29
00:02:43,719 --> 00:02:46,519
She is pretty good at it,

30
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,260
always gets the attention.

31
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:57,316
When will you accompany me shopping?

32
00:02:57,316 --> 00:02:58,304
Let's go out for the meal.

33
00:02:58,304 --> 00:03:01,579
I'm telling you, that new store
downstairs is delicious.

34
00:03:01,579 --> 00:03:03,980
I heard that too. The environment is great.

35
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:06,740
Alright, let's check it out.
You've worked hard.

36
00:03:06,740 --> 00:03:08,679
Let's get off duty, Shen Xi.

37
00:03:08,679 --> 00:03:10,856
It'll be quick.

38
00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:44,240
<i>Although the data proposal can make it fast in straightaways,</i>

39
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,500
<i>it does not take into account the driving characteristics
of Chen Mobai as a driver.</i>

40
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:50,844
<i>Too little downforce in the corners.</i>

41
00:03:50,844 --> 00:03:54,179
<i>His characteristic is to ignite early,</i>

42
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:57,900
<i>so it's hard for him to control.</i>

43
00:03:57,900 --> 00:03:59,780
<i>I find it hard to trust others,</i>

44
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,460
<i>because it's hard for me to imagine</i>

45
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:04,560
<i>how it feels to entrust my life
to someone else.</i>

46
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:07,816
<i>But for some reason</i>

47
00:04:07,816 --> 00:04:11,399
<i>I have this inexplicable trust in you.</i>

48
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:03,039
This data from Liu Qianqian this time is a bit different from last time.

49
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,299
It seems not so fierce.

50
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:06,920
That means she's flexible.

51
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:08,868
It's a good thing.

52
00:05:09,632 --> 00:05:12,416
<i>[The chassis is too high when turning, increasing

55
00:05:22,140 --> 00:05:23,940
Who sent this data over?

56
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,460
Dr. Shen.

57
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:27,879
I haven't seen her for a long time.

58
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:33,079
M-Mobai, why are you laughing?

59
00:05:33,079 --> 00:05:35,608
Why are you laughing?

60
00:05:35,608 --> 00:05:38,590
I-I-I think the data tuning is perfect.

61
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:40,608
Hurry up and prepare the car,
we'll try it right away.

62
00:05:40,608 --> 00:05:42,064
Okay.

63
00:05:42,064 --> 00:05:44,539
Okay, I go get busy.

64
00:05:56,928 --> 00:05:58,244
Why are you so happy?

65
00:05:58,244 --> 00:06:01,140
I've never seen you so happy
even when you won the championship.

66
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:05,764
Shen Xi.

67
00:06:05,764 --> 00:06:07,220
Data tuning from Shen Xi.

68
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,888
Let me see.

69
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,584
She said no, but acted honestly.

70
00:06:16,584 --> 00:06:19,399
That's my engineer.

71
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:25,084
Go on.

72
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,982
<i>[You can speed up your life once in a while.]</i>

73

74
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:02,780
Do I look okay to you?

75
00:08:14,020 --> 00:08:16,599
Are you here to see me today?

76
00:08:24,659 --> 00:08:28,192
The new data tuned is so good
and the speed became fast.

77
00:08:28,192 --> 00:08:30,219
Why do you tell me about it?

78
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:34,639
You tuned the data. Who else should I tell?

79
00:08:35,879 --> 00:08:37,279
Just admit it.

80
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,659
No reputation for good deeds
is not a fashion anymore.

81
00:08:40,512 --> 00:08:42,232
So,

82
00:08:42,232 --> 00:08:46,320
are you thinking about joining the team now?

83
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,764
No.

84
00:08:47,764 --> 00:08:51,059
I think the way it is now is the best.

85
00:08:51,059 --> 00:08:52,119
Why?

86
00:08:52,119 --> 00:08:54,040
Miss Liu's data is quite good.

87
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:57,460
I just adjusted it to make it more suitable for you.

88
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,739
That's all I can do.

89
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,379
Since you've admitted it,

90
00:09:07,379 --> 00:09:09,516
I guess I have to thank you.

91
00:09:09,516 --> 00:09:11,060
N-No need.

92
00:09:11,060 --> 00:09:13,659
I'm hungry. Treat me to a meal.

93
00:09:13,659 --> 00:09:15,939
I-I don't have any money.

94
00:09:15,939 --> 00:09:18,700
You invite me, and I'll pay.

95
00:09:28,759 --> 00:09:32,540
1:32,109. That's a lot faster than before.

96
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:35,579
And have you noticed that the car is much steadier than before?

97
00:09:35,579 --> 00:09:38,680
Yes. I got a better ride this time.

98
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,319
But we can't get complacent.

99
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:42,200
There is a long way between us and Mitsui Taku.

100
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,419
Great progress.

101
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:46,972
Why are you here?

102
00:09:46,972 --> 00:09:48,760
As a dedicated director of the team, can't I come and check it out?

103
00:09:48,760 --> 00:09:51,100
can't I come and check it out?

104
00:09:51,159 --> 00:09:53,460
By the way, don't forget the bet.

105
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,120
Where is your engineer? I don't see her.

106
00:09:56,120 --> 00:09:57,279
She gets busy.

107
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,700
She is busy in the wind tunnel at the R&D center.

108
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,179
Well, how do you communicate then?

109
00:10:03,179 --> 00:10:05,599
We have to rely on assistant Shen.

110
00:10:06,779 --> 00:10:08,880
Shen Xi?

111
00:10:09,799 --> 00:10:11,820
Is she involved in the team's work now?

112
00:10:11,820 --> 00:10:13,160
Just running errands.

113
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,260
She delivers documents between
the team and the engineering department.

114
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,960
Right. That's it.

115
00:10:21,639 --> 00:10:24,799
You're going somewhere
with me tomorrow morning, at 10 a.m.

116
00:10:24,799 --> 00:10:25,900
What for?

117
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,000
No questions. Just go.

118
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,879
I've got to practice. Go, go, go.

119
00:10:29,879 --> 00:10:31,720
If you don't show up tomorrow morning,

120
00:10:31,720 --> 00:10:36,559
these people of yours will be fired. I'm leaving.

121
00:10:36,559 --> 00:10:39,100
Wait. X-Xu Gong, see her off.

122
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,619
Hurry! Go.

123
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:46,679
Why is she so arrogant?

124
00:10:47,559 --> 00:10:50,320
I think it's okay.

125
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,764
You think it's okay?

126
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,780
I think you're out of your mind.

127
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:55,659
You should go. You heard it too.

128
00:10:55,659 --> 00:10:58,080
If she doesn't see someone tomorrow, she'll fire all of you.

129
00:10:58,080 --> 00:11:00,400
No way! Why always me?

130
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,140
What? Let me tell you.

131
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,340
We're not in the same level right now.
I'm not as good as her.

132
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:08,079
You're the right person.

133
00:11:08,128 --> 00:11:09,884
What do you mean?

134
00:11:09,884 --> 00:11:11,520
Every time I see her, we argue.

135
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,600
But you are different.

136
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,280
You can impress and conquer her with your kindness.

137
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:21,880
There's a saying, when you walk on the street,

138
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:23,580
you meet someone want to bite the dog.

139
00:11:23,580 --> 00:11:27,272
The dog says, "Come on. I don't scare you."

140
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,416
Who's the dog?

141
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,476
Do you mean I'm the dog? You'd go.

142
00:11:35,476 --> 00:11:36,960
You'd go.

143
00:11:36,960 --> 00:11:40,740
I won't go. I'm not going
no matter what this time.

Sir, what can I do for you?

147
00:11:57,679 --> 00:12:01,400
Hello, I'm looking for Miss Zhao Yingning.

148
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,528
This way, please.

149
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,216
Over here.

150
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:23,040
Chen Mobai. You're so mean.

151
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:26,120
You ask me to clean up your mess every time.

152
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:32,880
It's okay. Wait. Hao Yang, you're the team manager.

153
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:37,340
You've seen everything. Right? It's okay.

154
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:42,500
Chen Mobai, just wait. You win.

155
00:12:46,039 --> 00:12:48,200
Miss Zhao, your taste is really good.

156
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:52,400
The groom will be amazed when he sees you.

157
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:57,839
Miss Zhao, sir is here.

158
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:35,740
This is the groom-to-be, right?

159
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:39,596
No. He is the backup.

160
00:13:39,596 --> 00:13:42,640
Seems like he replaced
the one in the last minute.

161
00:13:43,539 --> 00:13:45,400
I'll leave and prepare the jewelry first.

162
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,000
Okay.

163
00:13:52,872 --> 00:13:55,728
The one asked me to explore the way.

164
00:13:55,728 --> 00:13:59,339
I didn't expect it to be a highway.

165
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:02,799
Well, I'll leave.

166
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:07,780
Chen Mobai won't come, right?

167
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:14,120
He's busy.

168
00:14:17,956 --> 00:14:21,560
I really want to know what he doesn't like about me?

169
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:27,384
Looks? Body shape? Or personality?

170
00:14:31,720 --> 00:14:35,999
Do you know Serendipity?

171
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:38,719
You two are the same type,

172
00:14:39,876 --> 00:14:41,379
only competing against each other.

173
00:14:41,379 --> 00:14:47,219
But love is about growing together, not competing.

174
00:14:47,219 --> 00:14:50,139
So does he like submissive women?

175
00:14:50,139 --> 00:14:51,980
I don't know what he likes.

176
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:56,699
But I know what happens when he likes someone.

177
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:57,939
What happens?

178
00:14:57,939 --> 00:14:59,719

179
00:14:59,719 --> 00:15:03,059
at least… he'll try to get to know her

180
00:15:03,059 --> 00:15:07,319
and step into her world, rather than guessing.

181
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,400
If there is nothing else, I'll leave first.

182
00:15:20,708 --> 00:15:22,728
Wait.

183
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:29,559
This is an important indicator of my KPI this year.

184
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:32,660
I have to finish it on time.

185
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:36,459

186
00:15:38,976 --> 00:15:41,096
Me?

187
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,679

188
00:15:49,679 --> 00:15:54,279
Thank you. That sounds like a real compliment.

189
00:15:54,279 --> 00:15:55,900
Change the position, back to back.

190
00:15:55,900 --> 00:15:56,992
Don't overthink it.

191
00:15:56,992 --> 00:16:00,199
You're just standing here as an accessory.

192
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:04,940
Okay, hold on a second, I'll change the lens.

193
00:16:14,279 --> 00:16:18,320
Why don't you sit for a bit?

194
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,179
How much did Chen Mobai pay you? You came as he wished.

195
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,300
I came because I was afraid you'd wait here alone.

196
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:43,340
Actually, there's a question I've always wondered about.

197
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,760
Go ahead.

198
00:16:44,760 --> 00:16:46,159
Is your choice to marry Chen Mobai

199
00:16:46,159 --> 00:16:49,519
the result of rational analysis and objective choice?

200
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:51,060
What else?

201
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:54,020
Knowing each other's background and family.

202
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,019
We are matched for marriage.

203
00:16:56,019 --> 00:16:59,720
We don't have to spend time getting to
know each other and families,

204
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:02,940
or worry about anyone up to something evil.

205
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:06,619
But isn't love precious

206
00:17:06,619 --> 00:17:11,560
precisely because it takes time to know each other?

207
00:17:16,519 --> 00:17:19,519
Come on. Sorry for the waiting. Let's move on.

208
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,559
Keep smiling and be a little closer.

209
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:28,136
If love is anything like what you said it is, then I don't need love.

211

Mr. Mobai should at least
offer me a meal or something.

was fired the year Chuan died?

359
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:17,540
You mean the one who caused Chuan's death?

360
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:19,080
Of course I remember.

361
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:24,960
At that time, Markus had to fire that engineer to settle the matter.

362
00:29:25,619 --> 00:29:28,079
I think I know who that engineer is.

363
00:29:28,079 --> 00:29:32,479
How do you know when the gossip reporters haven't found out?

364
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:38,428
Is she really Chuan's engineer?

365
00:29:38,428 --> 00:29:40,120
Who?

366
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:48,704
- Hello. 
- Hello

367
00:29:48,704 --> 00:29:52,280
Is there a person named Shen Xi here?

368
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:55,039
Shen Xi again?

369
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:56,892
What's the matter?

370
00:29:56,892 --> 00:29:58,960
I'm her friend. I need to talk to her.

371
00:29:58,960 --> 00:30:00,560
Could you please call her for me?

372
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:03,092
Well. Do you have an appointment?

373
00:30:03,092 --> 00:30:05,840
Appointment? I-I've made an appointment before.

374
00:30:05,840 --> 00:30:07,000
Let me check.

375
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:10,000
Please take a close look. Actually…

376
00:30:12,419 --> 00:30:14,980
Sir, please wait.

377
00:30:14,980 --> 00:30:17,460
Shen Xi, I finally found you.

378
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:20,060
I need to talk to you.

379
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:23,680
What did happen with the Markus matter earlier?

380
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,680
I saw the news in Germany at that time,

381
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:28,359
- I know you must know something.
- I'm sorry, I have nothing to say.

382
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,480
Just give me a little more time.

383
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:32,420
Shen Xi, I really want to know
what was really going on then.

384
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:36,459
If you don't know her, and continue to harass her…

385
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:38,040
Security!

386
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:39,659
Don't…

387
00:30:39,659 --> 00:30:41,336
It's a misunderstanding.

388
00:30:41,899 --> 00:30:43,476
I'm leaving.

389
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,419
Are you alright, Miss Shen?

390
00:30:47,820 --> 00:30:50,340
I'm fine, thank you, Mr. An.

391
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:52,940
Don't mention it. Considering the arbitration matter,

392
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:56,580
and bringing Mr. Mobai back to Ruifeng this time,

393
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:59,379
you're a great contributor to the group.

394
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:06,019
I-I have to deliver the documents.

395
00:31:06,740 --> 00:31:08,312
Okay.

396
00:31:18,260 --> 00:31:21,400
Remember to investigate this Shen Xi for me.

397
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,440
Why is she involved in Markus?

398
00:31:25,440 --> 00:31:26,404
Okay.

399
00:31:26,404 --> 00:31:27,860
Who?

400
00:31:29,780 --> 00:31:31,759
Shen Xi?

401
00:31:33,540 --> 00:31:37,299
I mean, how does a PhD graduate would become an administrator?

402
00:31:37,299 --> 00:31:39,380
She really is that fired engineer?

403
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,940
Well, do we still use the data that she tuned for us?

404
00:31:41,940 --> 00:31:43,460
I think there must be other reasons.

405
00:31:43,460 --> 00:31:45,800
If she's the one who caused the accident…

406
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:50,680
Shen Xi, you are here.

407
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,716
Anything?

408
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:01,500
I have something to tell Chen Mobai alone.

409
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,300
Then you two talk.

410
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,899
I came here today to tell you something.

411
00:32:22,920 --> 00:32:24,864
- Actually…
- You don't need to.

412
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:28,000
I've always felt

413
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,740
that actions speak louder than words.

414
00:32:36,499 --> 00:32:41,079
You can tell me after seeing the test driving results today.

415
00:32:41,699 --> 00:32:43,340
It will give you more confidence.

416
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,719
Mobai, think it over, this is not a joke.

417
00:33:15,719 --> 00:33:18,039
Isn't it just half a second short?

418
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,404
Don't worry.

419
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:24,252
Be safe.

420
00:33:32,996 --> 00:33:34,784
Chen Mobai.

421
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:52,728
<i>♫ Grip the steering wheel
in the roars that soar into the sky ♫</i>

422
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:55,160
<i>♫ And burn out the dreams ♫</i>

423
00:33:55,160 --> 00:33:57,639
Mobai is going all out.

424
00:33:58,359 --> 00:34:00,419
This is the first time I saw him like this,

425
00:34:00,419 --> 00:34:02,900
more decisive and determined than ever before.

426
00:34:02,900 --> 00:34:05,799
It's good. The acceleration is smooth.

427
00:34:08,840 --> 00:34:10,919
<i>No matter what your past was,</i>

428
00:34:10,919 --> 00:34:15,260
<i> now let speed say it for me.</i>

429
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,519
<i>Full speed ahead means</i>

430
00:34:17,519 --> 00:34:20,160
- Great.
<i>- I absolutely trust you.</i>

431
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:23,840
I'm sure this is a record day.

432
00:34:24,768 --> 00:34:28,320
<i>♫ In the dream of racing ♫</i>

433
00:34:28,320 --> 00:34:37,968
<i>♫ In a triumphant stance,
fill up your tank with courage as fuel ♫</i>

434
00:34:37,968 --> 00:34:42,959
<i>At this moment, my heart started beating again.</i>

435
00:34:42,959 --> 00:34:45,980
<i>I like the feeling of blood flowing.</i>

436
00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:51,739
<i>I think, maybe I shouldn't fail his trust in me this time.</i>

437
00:34:51,739 --> 00:34:53,840
<i>I shouldn't regret again.</i>

438
00:34:55,840 --> 00:35:00,224
<i>♫ Fight for a race of a lifetime ♫</i>

439
00:35:00,224 --> 00:35:03,875
<i>♫ Against the wind ♫</i>

440
00:35:03,875 --> 00:35:08,910
<i>♫ And see the silver lining in desperation ♫</i>

441
00:35:10,860 --> 00:35:13,240
Why doesn't he slow down for the turn?

442
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:17,919
Mobai, what's happening? Answer me.

443
00:36:15,396 --> 00:36:20,284
Miss Mofei, should we inform Mr. Chen?

444
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,768
No.

445
00:36:26,699 --> 00:36:28,712
Chen Mobai's family.

446
00:36:30,819 --> 00:36:32,844
How is the situation?

447
00:36:33,659 --> 00:36:35,560
The situation is unclear.

448
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,760
If the patient can wake up as soon as possible,

449
00:36:37,760 --> 00:36:39,740
it means the cerebral hematoma
has been absorbed,

450
00:36:39,740 --> 00:36:42,399
then there shouldn't be a big problem.

451
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:45,279
When will he wake up?

452
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:48,279
This is the accident analysis just released
by the company's investigation team.

453
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:50,520
Mobai didn't make any control errors,

454
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,900
and there's no problem with our tuning.

455
00:36:51,900 --> 00:36:53,380
It should be the data.

456
00:36:53,380 --> 00:36:55,440
Liu Qianqian, I'll go find her.

457
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,208
Xu Gong.

458
00:36:57,208 --> 00:36:58,880
It might not be Miss Liu.

459
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,000
If not her, then who else?

460
00:37:33,619 --> 00:37:35,719
You'll catch a cold.

461
00:37:37,288 --> 00:37:39,240
Get up.

462
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:41,180
I'll send you home.

463
00:37:44,380 --> 00:37:46,280
Shaoqian.

464
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,179
I think I screwed up again.

465
00:37:53,199 --> 00:37:55,639
Don't say so.

466
00:37:55,639 --> 00:37:58,039
Everything will get better.

467
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,920
No.

468
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:07,800
I've tried very hard to forget the past

469
00:38:08,639 --> 00:38:11,820
and make myself to stay sober.

470
00:38:11,820 --> 00:38:14,180
But the fact is,

471
00:38:14,660 --> 00:38:17,480
everything is getting worse.

472
00:38:20,919 --> 00:38:22,820
Nothing will get better.

473
00:38:41,960 --> 00:38:42,900
Mr. An is here, please say something.

474
00:38:42,900 --> 00:38:45,540
Mr. An, how is Chen Mobai's condition now?

475
00:38:45,540 --> 00:38:46,592
Mr. An, may I ask

476
00:38:46,592 --> 00:38:48,660
if your company find out
who's responsible for the accident?

477
00:38:48,660 --> 00:38:51,859
Mr. Mobai is currently receiving
treatment in the hospital.

478
00:38:51,859 --> 00:38:54,339
We have to wait for the hospital
to tell us the exact situation.

479
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:56,660
As for the cause of the accident,

480
00:38:56,660 --> 00:39:00,100
as you all know, racing is a risky sport by nature,

481
00:39:00,100 --> 00:39:02,308
accidents happen. Thank you.

482
00:39:02,308 --> 00:39:03,380
Mr. An.

483
00:39:03,380 --> 00:39:05,588
Will it affect the team's participation in the Formula A championship?

484
00:39:05,588 --> 00:39:06,860
Can you answer this?

485
00:39:06,860 --> 00:39:08,720
If you have no other questions,

486
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:11,560
please contact our PR department. Thank you.

487
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,180
Could you give me some
more information, Mr. An?

488
00:39:13,180 --> 00:39:14,660
Could you tell us more, please?

489
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:16,920
Mr. An, say something.

490
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:21,560
These two unlucky siblings.

491
00:39:21,560 --> 00:39:23,400
The company paid for them
and they made fools of themselves.

492
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:25,539
The company helped them
and they embarrassed themselves.

493
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:28,540
Why can't they do
something good for the company?

494
00:39:29,320 --> 00:39:32,840
Let's see how they explain to the board.

495
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,079
Mr. An, don't worry. I got something here.

496
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,360
Such a basic data problem led to such a serious accident.

497
00:39:57,360 --> 00:40:00,344
Do you know Chen Mobai is
still lying in the hospital?

498
00:40:00,344 --> 00:40:03,819
Miss Mofei, I-I feel very ashamed.

499
00:40:05,819 --> 00:40:08,300
Before you came to Ruifeng,

500
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:10,240
you were an engineer
at the International Rally.

501
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:13,180
Did you repay the trust of the drivers

502
00:40:13,180 --> 00:40:14,960
by leaving them in the middle of nowhere?

503
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:17,939
No, I…

504
00:40:17,939 --> 00:40:19,319
I am really sorry for Mr. Mobai

505
00:40:19,319 --> 00:40:20,619
and you.

506
00:40:20,619 --> 00:40:23,139
I-I don't know what to say.

507
00:40:23,139 --> 00:40:26,139
I, Liu Qianqian, would dare to admit what I have done.

508
00:40:26,139 --> 00:40:29,580
I am willing to take all the blame.

509
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:31,192
Just wait!

510
00:40:39,460 --> 00:40:40,948
Miss Mofei.

511
00:40:40,948 --> 00:40:43,000
It's not Miss Liu's fault.

512
00:40:52,559 --> 00:40:54,919
Who are you to say that?

513
00:40:54,919 --> 00:40:57,040
It's my fault.

514
00:40:58,119 --> 00:40:59,619
I changed the data.

515
00:40:59,619 --> 00:41:01,879
You changed the data?

516
00:41:01,879 --> 00:41:04,479
I overstepped my authority
to modify the documents

517
00:41:04,479 --> 00:41:06,920
that led to Chen Mobai's accident.

518
00:41:07,679 --> 00:41:09,739
Please don't blame Miss Liu.

519
00:41:09,739 --> 00:41:12,199
I should be held accountable.

520
00:41:14,144 --> 00:41:15,632
Search.

521
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:20,719
Li Na, what are you doing?

522
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:22,239
I don't think it's appropriate
to search someone's drawers.

523
00:41:22,239 --> 00:41:23,980
Li Na, you've gone too far.

524
00:41:23,980 --> 00:41:26,699
This is the board taking evidence.

525
00:41:26,699 --> 00:41:28,844
Any problem?

526
00:41:31,580 --> 00:41:34,079
Mr. An, here.

527
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:39,340
Shen Xi, which one did you change?

528
00:41:39,340 --> 00:41:41,056
What is it?

529
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,079
Every single time.

530
00:41:44,980 --> 00:41:46,919
I've modified all parameters.

531
00:41:46,919 --> 00:41:48,540
Why?

532
00:41:48,540 --> 00:41:49,860
I want to help him.

533
00:41:49,860 --> 00:41:52,559
Do you want to help him or harm him?

534
00:41:55,944 --> 00:41:56,860
I'm sorry.

535
00:41:56,860 --> 00:41:59,660
His life is at risk
and you just tell me you're sorry?

536
00:42:00,540 --> 00:42:03,640
I-I'm willing to accept any punishment.

537
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:08,480
What is your relationship with Chen Mobai?

538
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,599
Why would he take you in working and racing?

539
00:42:11,599 --> 00:42:14,400
And why is he working
with you to change the data?

540
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,392
I don't know.

541
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:25,339
At the car inspection, you could calculate
the probability of 1 in 1000 right.

542
00:42:25,339 --> 00:42:27,848
During the race, you could tell if the tires are standard or not.

543
00:42:27,848 --> 00:42:30,800
I don't believe it's a coincidence

544
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,080
that you're making this stupid mistake now.

545
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:37,619
Did you confirm it was your data?

546
00:42:38,540 --> 00:42:39,360
No need.

547
00:42:39,360 --> 00:42:41,519
Why not?

548
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:44,960
You should find it out.

549
00:42:47,628 --> 00:42:48,952
Hello.

550
00:42:48,952 --> 00:42:52,819
Bring all the data on Chen Mobai's accident to the conference room

551
00:42:52,819 --> 00:42:54,350
now.

<i>♫ Fading away ♫</i>

561
00:43:55,259 --> 00:44:01,607
<i>♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫</i>

562
00:44:01,607 --> 00:44:09,575
<i>♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫</i>

563
00:44:09,575 --> 00:44:16,527
<i>♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫</i>

564
00:44:16,527 --> 00:44:20,879
<i>♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫</i>

565
00:44:20,879 --> 00:44:27,247
<i>♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫</i>

566
00:44:27,247 --> 00:44:34,699
<i>♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫</i>

567
00:44:34,699 --> 00:44:41,327
<i>♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫</i>

568
00:44:41,327 --> 00:44:51,210
<i>♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫</i>
