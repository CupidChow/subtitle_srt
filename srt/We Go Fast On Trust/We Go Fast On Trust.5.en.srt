Well… this could just be destiny.

17
00:02:53,739 --> 00:02:55,199
Why is it that we always run into each other?

18

You've been following me
from the hospital for half an hour.

19
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,400
I saw you just now.

20
00:03:03,719 --> 00:03:07,439
From the hospital,
it seemed like the unexpected encounters

You take care of your mother on weekends.

And you have to get up early for work
on weekdays.

25

Do you want me to introduce you to a job?

Although the pay may not be that high,

Awesome.

191
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:36,864
I said it was nominated. Take a look at this.

192
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:39,360

Counterfeit? Monkey business?

It's okay if you don't like it.

What I want to focus on reporting today
is this, this one.

198

Absolutely a knockoff big brand.

199

But they want to be the title sponsor.

You know, your boss is really generous.

217
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:51,279
So much money, just paid it for you.

218
00:13:54,279 --> 00:13:55,279
I will pay her back.

219
00:13:55,919 --> 00:13:58,440
No, no, this is what you don't understand.

220
00:13:59,559 --> 00:14:01,120
In this society now,

221
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:05,080
money is easy to pay back. The difficult thing
to pay back is the favor.

222
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:10,480
How to return the favor?

223
00:14:11,799 --> 00:14:13,680
What you are most lacking now is money.

224
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,039
They have already given it to you.

225
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:17,659
You should give her that thing

226
00:14:17,659 --> 00:14:20,140
Miss Mofei is longing for.

227
00:14:20,140 --> 00:14:22,440
Only then can you repay this favor.

228
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:27,759
What Miss Mofei seems to want the most now

229
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:33,639
is probably to persuade Chen Mobai
to return to Ruifeng.

230
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:38,420
Who? Is it that extremely handsome person?

231
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:40,559
The Chen Mobai that just won the championship?

232
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:43,552
I really like him. Do you like him?

233
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:46,399
Our classmates all like him
after watching the competition.

234
00:14:47,072 --> 00:14:48,159

235
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,528
What, like?

236
00:14:52,960 --> 00:14:54,144
Xi,

237
00:14:54,879 --> 00:14:57,760
your reaction just now was a bit off.

238
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:00,200
There must be some stories I don't know, right?

239
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,679
Gossip a bit, let's hear it.

240
00:15:04,159 --> 00:15:06,120
What stories could there be? There's no gossip.

241
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:09,320
You have no experience in social complexities.

242
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,399
Let me, a master, analyze it for you.

243
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,880
You see, when you start
to pay attention to someone,

244
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,840
you usually don't realize it yourself.

245
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:19,639
But there will be many signs.

246
00:15:21,159 --> 00:15:24,440
The first one is uncontrollable feelings.

247
00:15:25,159 --> 00:15:28,919
You might find yourself constantly
thinking about that person,

248
00:15:29,799 --> 00:15:31,480
always wanting to do something for him.

249
00:15:32,679 --> 00:15:33,919
Say, don't you?

250
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:35,008
No.

251
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,120
It's okay, the characteristic of this stage

252
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,240
is being impulsive without realizing it.

253
00:15:43,399 --> 00:15:44,540
But next,

254
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,480
you are going to move quickly into the stage
of constant petty disputes.

255
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,559
Eat quickly, I need to return
to the hospital later.

256
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:54,440
What's the rush? I'm not finished talking yet.

257
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:55,800
There's also the third stage.

258
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,159
The third stage is

259
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,279
the "standing together
through thick and thin" stage.

260
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:00,459
If you don't start eating now,

261
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,480
you won't make it back to the dorm in time.

262
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:06,679
Fine, fine. I thought
you'd want me to continue.

Chen Mobai to return to Ruifeng?</i>

265

from a large car company.</i>

266

00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:34,240

If you don't join a corporate team,

296
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,000
it's not good for your career.

297
00:18:27,359 --> 00:18:30,920
I recently learned
a winning negotiation strategy.

298
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,920
If you want to achieve your goal,

299
00:18:35,359 --> 00:18:37,519
you have to find the other person's pain point.

300
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:40,860
If you want me to listen to your advice,

301
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,920
you have to be my

Well,

What you're saying doesn't comply
with Clausius' theorem.

310
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:03,296
What theorem?

311
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,720
Simply put, it's about heat.

312
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:08,900
It can't be conducted
from a low-temperature object

313
00:19:08,900 --> 00:19:10,659
to a high-temperature one.

314
00:19:10,659 --> 00:19:12,120
It will only go from a high-temperature object

315
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:13,500

00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,779
why not consider a bit more

00:19:27,779 --> 00:19:29,200
about being my engineer?

325
00:19:29,799 --> 00:19:30,944
No, wait a minute.

534
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:07,759
Business has been good recently.
Another car has come.

535
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,000
Mobai,

536
00:31:14,112 --> 00:31:15,168
whose car is this?

537
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:17,039
Ours.

538
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,759
Ours? Where did you get so much money
to buy this car?

539
00:31:20,759 --> 00:31:21,839
I bought it during a promotion.

540
00:31:22,519 --> 00:31:23,599
I just got it back today.

541
00:31:24,920 --> 00:31:26,059
The most important thing is

542
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:27,104
that I don't want to get involved with Ruifeng.

543
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,799
Well, are you familiar
with the environment now?

544
00:31:31,759 --> 00:31:33,000
Next, it's your job.

545
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:35,904
What should I do?

546
00:31:37,359 --> 00:31:39,240
Come with me to tidy up the warehouse.

547
00:31:40,720 --> 00:31:42,020
The warehouse has not been cleaned
for two years.

548
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,900
It's too messy to let a girl do this hard work.

549
00:31:44,900 --> 00:31:46,620
It's because it's messy
that we need to tidy it up.

550
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,904
If it's not messy, who's going to clean it up?

551
00:31:47,904 --> 00:31:49,024
Let's go.

552
00:31:51,640 --> 00:31:53,839
Bro, what's this new trick of yours?

553
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:59,559
Step two, open the psychological valve.

554
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:08,320
Here,

555
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:11,160
it's where our team has stored all the parts,

556
00:32:11,160 --> 00:32:13,039
accessories, and documents

557
00:32:13,599 --> 00:32:15,720
since its establishment.

558
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,519
There are also some car supplies.

559
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:19,839
Help me tidy them up.

560
00:32:24,839 --> 00:32:26,048
What's wrong?

561
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,960
Are you intending to run away?

562
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:34,016
No, I will do it well.

563
00:32:34,519 --> 00:32:35,759
That's good.

564
00:32:35,759 --> 00:32:39,039
I hope you do everything well.

565
00:32:39,799 --> 00:32:40,880
Wipe every item

566
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,640
thoroughly.

Why aren't you more careful?

574
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:04,960
It's broken.

575
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:09,248
I'm sorry.

576
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:12,639
It's okay, I'll just change the surface.

577
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:15,679
Pay attention next time.

578
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:17,880
What would happen if it hit you?

579
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,159
What would you do if you got hurt?

580
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,119
Luckily, I arrived in time.

581
00:34:22,679 --> 00:34:23,840
You don't even thank me.

582
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:26,740
If you had the habit
of keeping things in order,

583
00:34:26,740 --> 00:34:27,740
this wouldn't have happened.

584
00:34:27,740 --> 00:34:28,960
It's quite easy to break components.

585
00:34:31,320 --> 00:34:32,559
Well, thank you for the reminder.

586
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,552
You're welcome.

587
00:34:36,760 --> 00:34:38,480
Let Chubby handle the rest.

588
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:40,480
No need.

589
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:42,719
I can handle my own affairs.

590
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:45,760
Wait for me a bit,
I need to step out for a while.

591
00:34:50,599 --> 00:34:53,559
I contacted the committee's manager privately
and he told me

592
00:34:53,559 --> 00:34:55,899
Mr. An did propose

593
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:57,240
to target other racers before the race,

594
00:34:57,240 --> 00:34:58,304
but he was rejected.

595
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:00,280
He really would do it.

596
00:35:01,559 --> 00:35:03,639
I'll go clarify with Mobai.

597
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,016
There's no need.

598
00:35:06,559 --> 00:35:08,239
It's no longer a matter between him and me.

599
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:10,679
It's a matter of his trust in Ruifeng.

600
00:35:11,239 --> 00:35:12,320
Let's just leave it as it is for now.

601
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:14,320
Shen Xi took leave.

602
00:35:15,520 --> 00:35:16,619
She went to see Mobai.

603
00:35:16,619 --> 00:35:17,960
She said she wanted to convince him
to return to Ruifeng.

604
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:19,800
Didn't Chen Mobai chase her away?

605
00:35:20,440 --> 00:35:24,039
No, Hao Yang told me
they were getting along quite well.

606
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:26,848
Do you think she can do it?

607
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,820
If Mobai doesn't return,

608
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:33,440
how will the situation
with Zhao Yingning be resolved?

609
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,280
Since she hasn't withdrawn, that means

610
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,199
she doesn't really want to quit.

611
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:40,880
She wants a bigger piece of the cake.

612
00:35:41,792 --> 00:35:42,839
There's room for negotiation.

613
00:35:42,839 --> 00:35:43,880
What about Mobai?

614
00:35:47,199 --> 00:35:49,079
Mobai is the cherry on top of the cake.

615
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,800
He makes Zhao Yingning's cake
seem more valuable.

616
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,920
We must hurry up with the process
at Maituo's side.

617
00:35:54,920 --> 00:35:55,968
We can only walk on two legs.

618
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:57,792
We have no other choice at this point.

Miss Mofei, when can Chen Mobai
return to Ruifeng?

621
00:36:16,679 --> 00:36:18,620
Time also accounts for financial costs.

622
00:36:18,620 --> 00:36:20,260
The matter is in progress.

623
00:36:20,260 --> 00:36:21,440
Please wait a bit longer, Miss Zhao.

624
00:36:22,639 --> 00:36:24,320
Can you give me a specific time?

625
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:25,760
I need to report to the company as well.

626
00:36:26,639 --> 00:36:29,120
<i>We'll try our best to expedite it,
please rest assured.</i>

627

If you don't have a better solution,

628
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:35,480
I have to try it out myself.

629
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:41,519
I told you long ago

630
00:36:42,239 --> 00:36:44,239
Ruifeng was currently in internal chaos.

631
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:48,239
Chen Mofei has no real intentions
to bring her brother back.

632
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:51,160
Chen Mofei knows her brother.

633
00:36:51,160 --> 00:36:52,679
She would never resort to bribing racers.

634
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:55,300
The success of Ruifeng
is their family's life's work.

635
00:36:55,300 --> 00:36:56,352
They would never mess it up.

636
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:59,860
I won't comment on your trust
in the Chen siblings.

637
00:36:59,860 --> 00:37:02,519
I'm baffled by how much faith
you have in Ruifeng.

638
00:37:03,559 --> 00:37:04,820
Do you really think my judgment

639
00:37:04,820 --> 00:37:06,000
is influenced by personal relationships?

640
00:37:07,079 --> 00:37:08,220
You know me.

641
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,559
I always focus on the matters at hand,
not the people involved.

642
00:37:10,519 --> 00:37:12,559
Chen Mofei has a keen eye
for strategic technology.

643
00:37:13,480 --> 00:37:16,039
Though the R&D of vehicular lithium-ion
batteries face numerous challenges,

644
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,199
once we overcome these obstacles,

645
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:20,960
it can potentially change the landscape
of the electric vehicle industry.

646
00:37:21,639 --> 00:37:23,540
I don't want to miss out
on this golden opportunity to bottom-fish.

647
00:37:23,540 --> 00:37:25,740
This might be a great chance to bottom-fish.

648
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,440
But why did you bring up the issue of racing?

649
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:30,464
This increases the investment
a great deal, Miss.

650
00:37:30,464 --> 00:37:31,552
Confidence.

651
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:33,639
What Ruifeng lacks right now is confidence.

652
00:37:34,679 --> 00:37:37,180
Chen Mobai's championship can
significantly boost morale in Ruifeng.

653
00:37:37,180 --> 00:37:39,800
It will also turn Chen Mobai
into a renowned figure.

654
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,760
And it will draw a lot of attention
from the market to Ruifeng.

655
00:37:44,239 --> 00:37:46,599
I will invite Chen Mobai to join me
at the racing forum tomorrow night.

656
00:37:47,199 --> 00:37:48,380
Then I will persuade him to return to Ruifeng.

657
00:37:48,380 --> 00:37:49,599
Don't blame me for not warning you.

658
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:53,020
When it comes to money,

659
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:54,380
you can strategize to minimize the risks.

660
00:37:54,380 --> 00:37:55,440
But avoid mixing feelings into this.

661
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:58,920

with emotions involved.

You must accept it.

671

The main reason I bought this watch for you

672
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:30,840
is to synchronize our schedules.

673
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,960
This way, you can't

674
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:34,920
use being late as an excuse to delay work.

675
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,460

This smells like pickled fish.

It should make some contributions to our home.

686
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,040
I didn't touch your fish.

687
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,099
I bought it myself.

688
00:41:11,099 --> 00:41:12,340
Where is my fish?

00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,960

Yes.

00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:29,216
You need to wash the dishes.

698
00:41:31,519 --> 00:41:33,400
You must

699
00:41:33,400 --> 00:41:36,060
finish this ordinary work meal with us.

700
00:41:36,060 --> 00:41:37,620

What glasses?

704
00:42:01,088 --> 00:42:02,272
Did you see them?

No.

A friend gave them to me.

What kind of friend, your boyfriend?

712
00:42:19,239 --> 00:42:20,320
No,

713
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:22,840
but a very important friend.

714
00:42:23,800 --> 00:42:25,639
Xu Gong, eat your food properly.

715
00:42:42,519 --> 00:42:43,584
Is the pickled fish good?

716
00:42:45,480 --> 00:42:46,599
It's okay.

717
00:42:46,599 --> 00:42:48,080
If you were to become my engineer,

718
00:42:48,080 --> 00:42:49,679
I would let you eat pickled fish every day.

719
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,680
I have to go.

720
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:54,560
No, no, I'll send you.

721
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:05,248
Wait a minute, those…

722
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,008
Those are my glasses.

723
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,048
Wait, wait a minute.

724
00:43:10,840 --> 00:43:12,039
You look better without glasses.

725
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,959
These glasses are important to me.
Give them back to me.

726
00:43:14,959 --> 00:43:17,000
Isn't it just an ordinary pair
of plain glass spectacles?

727
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,920
Who sent them that you're so sensitive?

728
00:43:22,320 --> 00:43:24,000
Markus

729
00:43:26,039 --> 00:43:27,239
Lin.

730
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,880
Isn't this Markus' employee number?

731
00:43:31,039 --> 00:43:32,639
You have a friend in Markus?

732
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:36,079
Is this your secret?

733
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:48,996
<i>♫ The wind breathes quietly ♫</i>

734
00:43:50,916 --> 00:43:55,520
<i>♫ The heart gradually silences ♫</i>

735
00:43:56,900 --> 00:44:03,488
<i>♫ Your traces remain in my mind ♫</i>

736
00:44:03,488 --> 00:44:08,576
<i>♫ I can't delete them ♫</i>

737
00:44:09,636 --> 00:44:15,648
<i>♫ Time drips away bit by bit ♫</i>

738
00:44:15,648 --> 00:44:22,528
<i>♫ Memories are scattered everywhere ♫</i>

739
00:44:22,528 --> 00:44:30,976
<i>♫ The passing trees cast shadows like you ♫</i>

740
00:44:31,812 --> 00:44:35,808
<i>♫ Fading away ♫</i>

741
00:44:36,964 --> 00:44:43,456
<i>♫ Change the details bit by bit ♫</i>

742
00:44:43,456 --> 00:44:49,824
<i>♫ Decide our fate
in every second of every minute ♫</i>

743
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:58,176
<i>♫ Just like the paradox of love ♫</i>

744
00:44:58,176 --> 00:45:02,528
<i>♫ The synchronization of heartbeats ♫</i>

745
00:45:02,528 --> 00:45:08,896
<i>♫ The surge of longing burns within ♫</i>

746
00:45:08,896 --> 00:45:15,648
<i>♫ Waiting to find the answer at the end ♫</i>

747
00:45:15,648 --> 00:45:22,976
<i>♫ Accelerating against the wind is your pride ♫</i>

748
00:45:22,976 --> 00:45:32,576
<i>♫ And also my ultimate goal ♫</i>
