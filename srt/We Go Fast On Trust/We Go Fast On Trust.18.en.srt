15
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:41,719
Yesterday,

16
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,760
did I confess my feelings?

17
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,800
Did she say yes?

18
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:52,640
I don't think so. But she didn't say no.

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,088
Where's Yang?

20
00:01:58,079 --> 00:01:59,959
Wasn't he drinking with us last night?

21
00:02:01,959 --> 00:02:04,680
Do you feel like something was missing

22
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:07,239
when you woke up this morning?

23
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,560
Something does seem to be missing.

24
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,199
Mobai?

25
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,256
And Xi?

26
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,599
I was wondering

27
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:20,039
where they were last night.

28
00:02:21,039 --> 00:02:22,960
Could they have snuck out
to celebrate on their own?

29
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:24,864
Not likely.

30
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,000
When I was half-asleep last night,

31
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,160
I saw Xi leaving by herself.

32
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:30,680
She left by herself?

33
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:32,080
But it might have been my mistake
since I drank too much.

34
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:38,520
Leaving by herself…

35
00:02:44,759 --> 00:02:45,760
Yang.

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:54,240
You're all here.

37
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,464
What's up?

38
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,576
Playing games.

39
00:03:06,919 --> 00:03:11,080
Yang, weren't you supposed
to drop off Miss Zhao last night?

40
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,679
Why are you just getting back?

41
00:03:13,679 --> 00:03:14,960
Well…

42
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,199
It's not your business.

43
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:19,640
Don't you three start slacking off

44
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,180
just because you won the game.

45
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:23,960
Have you completed the task
that Dr. Shen assigned to you?

46
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,159
Speaking of whom,

47
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,719
did you see Mobai and Xi last night?

48
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:31,939
I didn't, why?

49
00:03:31,939 --> 00:03:34,360
They've been missing since last night.

50
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,000
Just give them a call.

51
00:03:39,108 --> 00:03:40,384
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Chen Mobai]</font></font></i>

52
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,639
Try Xi then.

<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Shen Xi]</font></font></i>

54
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,800
Wait, why aren't they picking up the phone?

55
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,680
Hello.

56
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,479
Okay, got it. I see.

57
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:18,199
I know where he is now. Wait for me.

58
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:19,264
Yang…

59
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,800
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Wish You A Safe Journey]</font></font></i>

60

61

62

64
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:49,472
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">I wish you a safe journey.</font></font></i>

65
00:05:07,639 --> 00:05:09,000
I bought you some ice cream.

66
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,360
I remember back in Markus,

67
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,959
every time you had ice cream,
it made you happy.

68
00:05:28,439 --> 00:05:32,544
At that time, Chuan would say it has
no nutrients and wouldn't let you have it.

69
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,480
So the two of us

70
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,199
would sneak out for it.

71
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,399
Do you want me to call Chen Mobai?

72
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:09,696
No, thanks.

73
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,224
I'm fine.

74
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,600
So, what are your plans now?

75
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,839
I know it's not quite the right timing,

76
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:41,199
and you've said no once.

77
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,360
But would you like to reconsider coming back

78
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,680
to Markus with me?

79
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,079
Think of it as a short leave from here.

80
00:06:53,399 --> 00:06:56,480
It'll be good for you and him.

81
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,656
Have some water.

82
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:50,000
Did you say he's been like this since morning?

83
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:53,840
Yep. Luckily, I'm familiar with the staff here.

84
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,980
They noticed he wasn't training properly
and got worried.

85
00:07:55,980 --> 00:07:57,319
So they immediately called me here.

86
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,439
What about Shen Xi?

87
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,100
I've been calling her all day,

88
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,319
and she hardly answered.

89
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:05,380
Then she told me she was going back to Markus,

90
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:06,759
leaving the day after tomorrow.

91
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:07,800
Why so sudden?

92
00:08:08,512 --> 00:08:09,560
I don't know.

93
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:11,800
They are the same. They won't say anything.

94
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,759
Chen Mobai, when will you stop running?

95
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:29,000
Just tell us what happened.

96
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:34,816
Take a rest.

97
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:40,040
If you don't want Shen Xi to leave,
you should stop her.

98
00:08:40,040 --> 00:08:42,200
Why are you torturing yourself here?

99
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,100
Yes, if there's any misunderstanding,

100
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,519
you should explain it to her properly.

101
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,120
What if she leaves and never comes back?

102
00:08:53,799 --> 00:08:54,816
She won't.

103
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:56,799
This is not the time to be stubborn.

104
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,540
Aren't you the demon king that can't stop
once you enter the field?

105
00:08:59,540 --> 00:09:02,120
What happened? Don't you even
dare to stop or chase after her?

106
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:19,168
I won't.

107
00:09:21,399 --> 00:09:22,399
I respect her choice.

108
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:30,260
She's leaving on an early flight
the day after tomorrow.

109
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:31,639
Don't blame me for not telling you.

128
00:11:25,759 --> 00:11:27,759
With the recent sudden halt
of the promotional campaign

129
00:11:27,759 --> 00:11:29,240
in various Junda stores,

130
00:11:29,919 --> 00:11:31,679
this price war unilaterally started

131
00:11:31,679 --> 00:11:33,759
by Junda company has ended.

132
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,879
Next, let's focus on the overseas information.

133
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,639
Our promotion plan was very successful.

134
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,460
According to the Marketing Dept.,

135
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:42,399
sales of all products have increased,

136
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,399
and the pre-sales performance
of Maituo is especially good.

137
00:11:48,159 --> 00:11:49,216
After all these years,

138
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,639
your hard work finally paid off.

139
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,200
Help me keep an eye on the workshop.

140
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,399
We must be extra cautious at this time.

141
00:11:58,399 --> 00:11:59,519
Not a single mistake is allowed.

142
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:03,840
The Race Team made a great contribution.

143
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:05,560
One more thing.

144
00:12:05,560 --> 00:12:07,000
I don't know if you've heard.

145
00:12:07,759 --> 00:12:08,864
What?

146
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:13,919
Shen Xi decided to leave Ruifeng
and return to Markus.

147
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:21,440
Would Chen Mobai agree?

148
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,440
I heard that Mobai did not object.

149
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,000
Do we need to intervene?

150
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:31,279
Everyone has the right to make choices.

151
00:12:32,679 --> 00:12:33,679
If one wants to leave,

152
00:12:34,528 --> 00:12:35,648
and the other does not stop her.

153
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,312
What can we do?

154
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,759
Has she handed over all her work?

155
00:12:41,759 --> 00:12:43,520
Shen Xi has handed over all her work files

156
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:44,679
to Engineer Liu.

157
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,639
Well, help me keep an eye on Chen Mobai then.

158
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:50,919
That's all we can do.

159
00:13:27,919 --> 00:13:28,928
Are you ready?

160
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,448
Xi.

161
00:13:54,159 --> 00:13:56,480
Little master, are you really leaving?

162
00:13:58,799 --> 00:14:01,080
Without you, I have no confidence.

163
00:14:01,919 --> 00:14:04,279
Remember what I told you
about improving assembly precision.

164
00:14:04,919 --> 00:14:06,279
and don't forget the theoretical knowledge.

165
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:08,559
You'll be fine. You can do it.

166
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:10,480
But without you, I…

167
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,919
Shen Xi, we all hate to see you go,

168
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,480
but we're all happy

169
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:17,559
that you can return to Markus, right?

170
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:21,200
Don't worry. We will work harder in the future.

171
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,720
Your future achievements
will be better and better.

172
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:28,992
Xi,

173
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,039
if you miss us, come back to visit us.

174
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:33,080
The Skyfall Team is always your home.

175
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:37,600
Sis, if you get bullied outside,

176
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:40,832
come back and we will stand up for you.

177
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:47,679
Alright, enough with the mushy comments.

178
00:14:51,799 --> 00:14:52,896
It's used.

179
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:54,799
We should get going.

180
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:57,399
Okay.

181
00:14:57,399 --> 00:14:58,400
Allow me, Xi.

182
00:14:58,919 --> 00:14:59,936
Thank you.

183
00:15:09,960 --> 00:15:10,976
Where is Mobai?

184
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,360
I don't have much to say.

185
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:19,072
Have a safe journey.

186
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
See you when fate allows.

187
00:15:26,559 --> 00:15:27,648
See you.

188
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,279
We really need to get going.

189
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:53,840
I'll come back to visit you when I have time.

190
00:16:12,679 --> 00:16:14,039
Do you want to wait for him?

191
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:24,279
No, let's go.

192

194
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,060
Hi, Nick.

195
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:30,112
Dr. Shen.

196
00:17:31,079 --> 00:17:33,500
Welcome back, it's been a long time.

197
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,660
Good to see you.

198
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:36,224
Shaoqian, good to see you.

199
00:17:36,224 --> 00:17:37,344
Nick. It's good to see you too.

200
00:17:37,344 --> 00:17:38,432
Please, follow me.

201
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:47,079
You two and Shen Chuan have been
waiting for this day for too long.

202
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:50,800
So as an apology from Markus,

203
00:17:50,800 --> 00:17:54,119
things will get back on track
as soon as possible.

204
00:17:57,160 --> 00:18:00,319
This is our special racing training program.

205
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:06,279
We made it to select the best racers.

206
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:10,440
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Markus Shanghai Special Training Camp Program]</font></font></i>
The best car deserves the best racer.

207
00:18:11,279 --> 00:18:12,388
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Markus Shanghai Special Training Camp Program]</font></font></i>
Right?

208
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:23,420
Wings of Wind?

209
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:26,000
Yes, Wings of Wind.

210
00:18:27,279 --> 00:18:30,319
That's our gift for your return with Markus.

211
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:36,079
We have decided to rebuild the car
with the highest standards.

212
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:39,480
And your revolutionary Air kit designs

213
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:40,680
will be integrated.

214
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,640
This time,

215
00:18:44,440 --> 00:18:48,160
Wings of Wind, I believe, will become

216
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,519
a legendary car in the history of Markus.

217
00:18:54,079 --> 00:18:55,079
And of course,

218
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:58,300
its complex new features

219
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:01,720
will put high pressure on the driver's ability.

220
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:03,720
That is why we have created

221
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,728
this special training program

222
00:19:06,560 --> 00:19:13,480
to find, together, the most suitable person
to drive Wings of Wind.

223
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,248
Thank you, Nick.

224
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,424
Don't thank me.

225
00:19:20,519 --> 00:19:24,200
It's your persistence
that has been my motivation.

226
00:19:25,319 --> 00:19:32,704
Please take this as the solemn apology
of Markus and of myself

227
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:42,496
to Shen Chuan, may he rest in peace,
and to you, Shen Xi.

228
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:52,079
Thank you, Nick.

229
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:18,780
Please, dear Mr. Chen.

230
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:19,920
Why are you still practicing here

231
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:21,728
in the middle of the night?

232
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,519
I'm not tired. I'll practice a little more.
You can go to sleep first.

233
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,600
The next stop is in a few days.

234
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,340
You need to get your head in the game.

235
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:30,400
My head is in the game.

236
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,680
Anyway, don't be too hard on yourself.

237
00:20:36,599 --> 00:20:37,600
Good night,

238
00:21:11,108 --> 00:21:13,760
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Gift from Wang Duobao]</font></font></i>

239
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,599
Congratulations to Chen Mobai
of Ruifeng Race Team

240
00:21:32,599 --> 00:21:34,680
for winning the championship
of the substation race again.

241
00:21:34,680 --> 00:21:35,920
Well, this should be

242
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,480
his sixth championship after Linhai stop.

243
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,720
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Chen Mobai won three consecutive championships]</font></font></i>
Let us sincerely congratulate him.

244
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:14,359
Good, you're getting more accurate.

245
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:25,039
His recent performance is so good,

246
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,519
achieving three consecutive championships.

247
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,599
But why is Mobai frowning all day long?

248
00:22:30,119 --> 00:22:31,559
I got up to pee last night.

249
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:34,880
And I saw Mobai go out at midnight
and didn't come back until morning.

250
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,640
How did he become this way recently?

251
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:40,640
You're having fun with Engineer Liu every day.

252
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,920
How would you understand
the pain of us who are longing for someone?

253
00:22:44,759 --> 00:22:47,660
Mobai trains during the day
and doesn't sleep at night.

254
00:22:47,660 --> 00:22:49,079
Can his body hold up?

255
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,319
I don't know where he goes every day.

260
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:20,480
Xi.

261
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,656
I knew you were up.

262
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:27,880
This is the list of the Special Training Camp.

263
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,272
Thank you.

264
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:36,200
Their resumes and rankings
for this season are attached in the back.

265
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,136

His recent performance is very good.

268
00:24:53,519 --> 00:24:54,680
And he's also been stable.

269
00:24:55,640 --> 00:24:57,920
He has also earned back many
of the points he lost before.

270
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:03,960
Do you think he will come?

271

<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Lu Yunhao's Resume]</font></font></i>

272
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:11,119
If he meets the criteria,
we will send him an invitation.

273
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,160
Whether he comes is up to him.

274
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:16,240
- Xi, actually…
- Don't worry.

275
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:18,239
Now that I'm back at Markus,

276
00:25:18,239 --> 00:25:19,799
I will do my job well.

277
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:23,296
Okay.

278
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,599
Good night, then.

279
00:25:28,519 --> 00:25:29,600
Good night.

280
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:31,799
- See you tomorrow
- See you tomorrow.

281
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:06,440
Yang, Mobai.

282
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,880
Yang, Mobai.

283
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:11,620
What's got you all excited?

284
00:26:11,620 --> 00:26:14,400
Markus! It's an invitation from Markus.

285
00:26:15,119 --> 00:26:16,128
Markus?

286
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:18,752
Mobai.

287
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:23,319
I really didn't expect
such a good thing to happen.

288
00:26:23,319 --> 00:26:24,839
Markus's invitation.

289
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:26,839
This is a rocket.

290
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,160
Direct access to the Super Grand Prix
and driving Wings of Wind.

291
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,780
Okay, you go up first.

292
00:26:32,780 --> 00:26:33,960
I need to talk to Mobai.

293
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:37,248
Go on.

<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Invitation Letter for Chen Mobai]</font></font></i>

295

Are you going?

296
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:17,152
I don't know.

297
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:20,279
You've been training
day and night like crazy recently.

298
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,039
Isn't it to get into the Super Grand Prix?

299
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,599
Shen Xi is in this training camp,

300
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:29,088
and you're afraid to face her, right?

301
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:34,319
I don't know what happened between you two,

302
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,720
but if you're both doing the best
for each other,

303
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,559
you should be more rational

304
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:43,680
and do what's right.

305
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:49,000
Yang, Engineer Liu is coming soon.

306
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,639
Didn't you just say that you wanted
to hold a summary meeting?

307
00:27:51,639 --> 00:27:53,568
Okay, I got it, get ready first.

308
00:28:01,319 --> 00:28:04,192
Think it over before you make a choice.

309
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:14,016
Think hard.

310
00:29:01,759 --> 00:29:03,039
It's time to unwrap the gift.

311
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:13,359
Ready?

312
00:29:13,359 --> 00:29:14,432
Let's go.

313
00:29:36,920 --> 00:29:38,240
It looks the same as before.

314
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,440
This is your gift to the racing world.

315
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:47,160
How is the registration of the contestants?

316
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:51,519
Basically, everyone who has received
an invitation has registered,

317
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,440
except for Chen Mobai.

318
00:30:02,599 --> 00:30:05,160
Do I need to call him and find out?

319
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:08,640
No.

320
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,480
There's not much we can do
if he doesn't want to come.

321
00:30:14,720 --> 00:30:15,840
If he doesn't come,

322
00:30:16,640 --> 00:30:17,640
wouldn't you feel pitiful?

323
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:24,320
No matter what, we choose our own paths.

324
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,272
Just let it be.

325
00:30:32,200 --> 00:30:33,480
A great man once said,

326
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:38,920
the road is tortuous, but the future is bright.

327
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:40,159
The first half of the season is over,

328
00:30:40,159 --> 00:30:43,219
and our results were very satisfying.

329
00:30:43,219 --> 00:30:45,160
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

330
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,480
- Cheers.
- Cheers, cheers.

331
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,520
Come on.

332
00:30:48,480 --> 00:30:49,880
Here,

333
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,680
we need especially thank someone.

334
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:56,192
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Mid-Season Summary]</font></font></i>
A hero who took up the challenge without fear

335
00:30:58,656 --> 00:31:00,256
and saved us from a predicament.

336
00:31:01,519 --> 00:31:03,799
We'll have Mobai thank her in person.

337
00:31:04,680 --> 00:31:06,839
There's no suspense. It's Engineer Liu.

338
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,280
It's normal. It's what I should do.

339
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,640
Let's not get emotional.

340
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,380
Don't be modest.

341
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,079
Your data is so beautifully done.

342
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:25,359
Not only was it quick,
but it was also very suitable for Mobai.

343
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:29,759
It matches the international standard,
accurate and ruthless.

344
00:31:31,079 --> 00:31:32,160
I can be sure

345
00:31:32,160 --> 00:31:34,599
you're not just seeing an engineer
through the eyes of a lover.

346
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:36,880
She really has achieved…

347
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:38,600
- Don't mess with me.
- Dr. Shen's standard.

348
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:40,279
If Engineer Liu wasn't here,

349
00:31:40,279 --> 00:31:41,952
I would think that this data is just

350
00:31:41,952 --> 00:31:43,136
from Dr. Shen.

351
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,760
Engineer Liu, why are you sweating
while drinking Cola?

352
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,560
I'm not. No.

353
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:53,000
We're all so familiar now, right?

354
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,799
Hearing compliments like this
makes me self-conscious.

355
00:31:56,400 --> 00:31:58,440
We are all family. Just be casual.

356
00:32:01,079 --> 00:32:02,119
Not only should there be compliments,

357
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,064
but there should also be rewards.

358
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,380
Engineer Liu, tell me what you want.

359
00:32:06,380 --> 00:32:07,880
I will pay for it personally.

360
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,928
That's not what I meant.

361
00:32:08,928 --> 00:32:09,952
If anything, you should buy it for Shen Xi.

362
00:32:19,319 --> 00:32:21,079
What I mean is that…

363
00:32:21,079 --> 00:32:24,520
Shen Xi has built a great foundation
in the early stages.

364
00:32:24,520 --> 00:32:26,440
Yes, exactly, a round of applause.

365
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:27,480
Good. Impressive.

366
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:32,980
Very good.

367
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:35,000
This meeting is so good.

368
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:37,759
I have to go. There's a thing.

369
00:32:37,759 --> 00:32:38,816
Who bought this? It's amazing.

370
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,759
Off I go now.

371
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:42,319
Qianqian, are you leaving so soon?

372
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,176
Engineer Liu.

373
00:32:50,176 --> 00:32:52,200
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[SKYFALL Auto Parts]</font></font></i>

374
00:32:52,200 --> 00:32:53,240
Why are you leaving so soon?

375
00:32:55,359 --> 00:32:57,440
Hao Yang grew two watermelons
on the rooftop. Take them with you.

376
00:32:57,440 --> 00:32:58,480
Ah…

377
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,680
You haven't eaten, have you?

378
00:33:00,279 --> 00:33:01,519
How about we have a meal together? Let's go.

379
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:02,560
No, no.

380
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:04,960
I must hurry back home.

381
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:07,620
No, I have to treat you to a meal.

382
00:33:07,620 --> 00:33:09,040
You've put in so much effort for me.

383
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,279
I have to reward you properly.

384
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:12,544
You can't get something for nothing.

385
00:33:12,544 --> 00:33:13,599
I see.

386
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:15,839
Watermelons and meals are too cheap.

387
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,079
How about we go and buy a gold necklace?

388
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,400
No, what are you doing?

389
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:22,720
Can you just let me go?

390
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:25,728
Fine.

391
00:33:27,079 --> 00:33:28,096
I can let you go.

392
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,824
Tell me the truth.

393
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,440
What did you want to say
about Shen Xi just now?

394
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:41,280
It's okay.

395
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,400
If you don't want to say it, I won't force you.

396
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:45,720
I'll pretend that I don't know.

397
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:47,839
In the future,

398
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:49,400
these guys and I

399
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,759
will treat you as our goddess

400
00:33:50,759 --> 00:33:52,240
every day like today.

401
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:55,359
It doesn't matter. You are our only goddess.

402
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,279
No.

403
00:33:57,279 --> 00:33:59,488
Why would you two drag me into your quarrel?

404
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,260
One won't let me talk no matter what,

405
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:03,960
and the other will torture me to death
if I don't speak.

406
00:34:04,640 --> 00:34:06,400
I'm very innocent, sir.

407
00:34:09,239 --> 00:34:10,480
Just tell me what's going on.

408
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,544
You can see for yourself.

409
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:34,679
<i><font size="16"><font face="Arial">[Shen Xi]</font></font></i>
Engineer Liu, this is the latest modified data. Thanks.

410
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:38,368
So,

411
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:42,760
all this data was sent to you by Shen Xi.

412
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:44,719
After she left,

413
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:47,199
she asked me to come over here as an engineer.

414
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:50,280
But she was worried that I wouldn't
be able to adapt to your style,

415
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:53,100
so after I finished the data each time,

416
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,760
she would take it
and modify it carefully again.

417
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:57,880
Look at her.

418
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,040
She's really hard-working.

419
00:35:00,040 --> 00:35:02,280
Busy with the camp during the day,

420
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,639
and she has to worry
about these things for you at night.

421
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:08,480
Every time I receive her call at midnight,

422
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:11,559
she always sounds exhausted.

423
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:13,760
It's quite sad.

424
00:35:22,679 --> 00:35:23,776
Good luck and see ya.

425
00:35:45,239 --> 00:35:46,272
Looking for me?

426
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,104
Chen Mobai, why have you become so long-winded?

427
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,119
No, I haven't.

428
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:57,000
Why are you looking for me?

429
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,240
Do you think I want to?

430
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:00,939
If it wasn't for Hao Yang
constantly nagging me,

431
00:36:00,939 --> 00:36:03,079
saying that Mobai is in a bad mood,
Mobai is not in good condition,

432
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:04,880
Mobai wants someone to chat with him,

433
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:07,480
I couldn't be bothered to deal with you.

434
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:09,540
Boss, is my skewer ready?

435
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:10,760
It's ready. Here it comes.

436
00:36:16,039 --> 00:36:18,079
What's the point of drinking alone?
Let me join you.

437
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,599
Engineer Liu told me today…

438
00:36:58,960 --> 00:37:00,719
that the data for these few stops
was all from Shen Xi.

439
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,280
Can you guess how I felt when I heard that?

440
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:06,500
What else could you feel? Happy, right?

441
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,900
It means she's still thinking of you.

442
00:37:07,900 --> 00:37:09,320
I was very confused.

443
00:37:11,039 --> 00:37:12,128
Very confused.

444
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,280
I don't know what to make of her help.

445
00:37:19,800 --> 00:37:20,832
I also felt very guilty

446
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,559
because I just watched her

447
00:37:26,239 --> 00:37:27,239
worrying about me every day

448
00:37:29,519 --> 00:37:30,624
and staying up late for me.

449
00:37:35,199 --> 00:37:36,224
I don't want that.

450
00:37:37,159 --> 00:37:39,360
You just can't get over your pride.

451
00:37:42,199 --> 00:37:44,079
If you're in pain, go find her.

452
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,320
You know I won't do that.

453
00:37:49,039 --> 00:37:51,960
If you want to see her, go see her.
Solve the problem if there is any.

454
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:01,440
Easy for you to say. I think you
called me here this time

455
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:03,639
just to deliberately sprinkle
chili powder on my wound.

456
00:38:04,679 --> 00:38:06,580
This is what I call
fighting poison with poison.

457
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,519
Prick you a few times and let you bleed,

458
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:10,304
maybe then you'll be okay.

459
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:15,880
Do you think it's because
I don't want to see her?

460
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,112
It's that I can't.

461
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,920
I hate it when people do that.

462
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:23,480
You can't even bear to get
a little mud on your legs,

463
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,880
and yet you talk about running
toward each other.

464
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:26,920
I just want to remind you,

465
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,920
that if one solution doesn't work,

466
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:31,199
don't be stubborn about it.

467
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,599
Find another way to go around it.

468
00:38:36,320 --> 00:38:37,344
Like?

469
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,519
Like me, I wanted to be with you.

470
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,580
I tried, I went for it,

471
00:38:43,580 --> 00:38:45,320
but it didn't work, so I gave up.

472
00:38:46,239 --> 00:38:48,260
I am now formally notifying you,

473
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:50,480
that I, Zhao Yingning,
am giving up on you, Chen Mobai.

474
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,440
It's just like investing.

475
00:38:55,039 --> 00:38:56,400
Knowing when to cut loss

476
00:38:57,559 --> 00:38:59,239
is much wiser than indefinitely investing.

477
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:02,656
That's you.

478
00:39:04,719 --> 00:39:05,840
Yes, it's me.

479
00:39:06,519 --> 00:39:08,800
But we can only be ourselves,

480
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:10,816
and when we encounter problems, we can only use

481
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:12,239
our own ways to solve them.

482
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:14,360
Don't get stuck in the other person's logic.

483
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:17,199
Besides, love is not

484
00:39:17,199 --> 00:39:19,240
about you becoming me and me becoming you.

485
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,880
You're still you, and I'm still me,

486
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,760
but together, we become "us".

487
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:29,440
My own way…

488
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,599
But there's only one standard.

489
00:39:33,519 --> 00:39:34,639
When making choices,

490
00:39:35,199 --> 00:39:36,840
make the one you won't regret.

491
00:39:54,800 --> 00:39:58,159
How's the progress on Maituo recently?

492
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,880
You guys talk. I'll go get the medicine.

493
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:05,600
Okay.

494
00:40:08,079 --> 00:40:10,760
Dad, in terms of the production line,

495
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:12,780
the parts suppliers are all caught up.

496
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:14,280
They're working overtime for production.

497
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,719
The number of pre-sale orders
has far surpassed expectations.

498
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:21,379
We must remind the factory

499
00:40:21,379 --> 00:40:24,440
the more tense the situation, the more
attention must be paid to production safety.

500
00:40:25,280 --> 00:40:26,440
I have reminded them many times.

501
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:29,760
For so many years,

502
00:40:30,559 --> 00:40:31,880
thanks to your persistence,

503
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,920
Maituo caused a phenomenal stir

504
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:35,104
as soon as it was launched.

505
00:40:37,519 --> 00:40:38,599
Well, it's also thanks to Mobai.

506
00:40:39,559 --> 00:40:41,819
His Formula A performance was very good,

507
00:40:41,819 --> 00:40:43,320
attracting more attention to Ruifeng.

508
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:47,000
It seems that your relationship

509
00:40:47,800 --> 00:40:48,832
has improved a lot.

510
00:40:50,280 --> 00:40:51,719
Mobai has grown up

511
00:40:52,719 --> 00:40:53,760
and become more mature.

512
00:40:55,199 --> 00:40:56,320
Right?

513
00:40:58,519 --> 00:40:59,519
Everything is getting better.

514
00:41:05,199 --> 00:41:06,304
Come on.

of this Formula A season.

520
00:41:37,519 --> 00:41:38,560
In the next few days,

521
00:41:39,159 --> 00:41:41,280
we will have stricter demands

00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,959
for your physical and racing skills.

523
00:41:42,959 --> 00:41:44,280
Good luck, everyone.

524
00:41:48,159 --> 00:41:49,519
- Excuse me.
- I am also an invited driver.

525
00:41:49,519 --> 00:41:50,528

- Unrelated personnel are not allowed to enter.
- What unrelated personnel?

530
00:41:55,360 --> 00:41:56,360
I am not unrelated personnel.

531
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,360
- Please understand.
- I must come to this training camp. If not,

532
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,400
- how will you select the best driver?
- Sir.

533
00:42:00,400 --> 00:42:02,280
It's not my loss. It's Markus's loss.

534
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:03,519
- Do you understand?
- Sir.

535
00:42:03,519 --> 00:42:04,519
- Don't stop me.
- Sir.

536
00:42:05,199 --> 00:42:06,599

- Reporting. I'm here.
