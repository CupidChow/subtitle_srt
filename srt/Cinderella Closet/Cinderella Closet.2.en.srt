1
00:00:04,004 --> 00:00:09,443
I think I was more feminine
back when I was just dreaming of Tokyo.

2
00:00:10,244 --> 00:00:11,245
I'm so sorry!

3
00:00:13,981 --> 00:00:17,451
How do you get those long lashes?
Or that radiant skin!

4
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,153
You wanted to look cute
for a guy you liked.

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:22,356
I have no confidence.

6
00:00:22,422 --> 00:00:23,690
I'll cast a spell on you.

7
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,560
An amazing one
that gives you so much confidence

8
00:00:26,627 --> 00:00:28,262
you won't care about
outside opinions anymore.

9
00:00:28,328 --> 00:00:31,598
I was waiting for you!

10
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:33,600
How about we go on a date?

11
00:00:33,667 --> 00:00:34,701
Okay!

12
00:00:34,768 --> 00:00:37,471
Could you please teach me your magic?

13
00:00:37,538 --> 00:00:40,741
I don't coddle people
who've never made the effort.

14
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:45,946
You're Hikaru?

15
00:00:46,013 --> 00:00:47,581
Why don't you forget him

16
00:00:48,148 --> 00:00:49,149
and choose me.

17
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,985
What?!

18
00:00:54,988 --> 00:00:56,390
You're a man?

19
00:00:56,456 --> 00:00:57,624
I don't understand.

20
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,961
Hold on.

21
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:06,466
Here you go.

22
00:01:07,935 --> 00:01:08,769
Cross-dressing?

23
00:01:09,803 --> 00:01:11,271
-Why?
-Well…

24
00:01:12,606 --> 00:01:15,509
I like beautiful things,
so I just wear what I want.

25
00:01:17,778 --> 00:01:18,679
I see.

26
00:01:21,949 --> 00:01:22,783
What?

27
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:25,519
Then, we spent the night together,

28
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,556
a man and a woman under the same roof?

29
00:01:37,831 --> 00:01:39,366
What's the big deal?

30
00:01:39,433 --> 00:01:41,802
You were the one being aggressive.

31
00:01:42,469 --> 00:01:45,272
-What did I do?
-You wanna know?

32
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:49,176
It should be obvious.

33
00:01:51,912 --> 00:01:53,447
What?

34
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:07,761
Love problems?

35
00:02:07,828 --> 00:02:10,397
I wish it were that easy.

36
00:02:17,371 --> 00:02:18,805
What the hell is this?

37
00:02:19,873 --> 00:02:20,774
Ow!

38
00:02:20,841 --> 00:02:22,409
That way!

39
00:02:22,476 --> 00:02:24,845
This is a pigsty.

40
00:02:28,181 --> 00:02:29,216
Got it all out?

41
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:30,917
I'm done. All done.

42
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:33,387
Your socks were in the kitchen.

43
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:35,522
Put your tummy away!

44
00:02:35,589 --> 00:02:36,723
Stop scratching!

45
00:02:36,790 --> 00:02:37,891
I'm borrowing this.

46
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:41,762
Why is there a bra here?

47
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:44,097
Laundry.

48
00:02:45,799 --> 00:02:46,633
No way!

49
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:51,004
Give me a break already.

50
00:02:59,613 --> 00:03:01,481
Wait, she'll puke.

51
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:04,718
So many spare lint rollers
when she never cleans.

52
00:03:04,785 --> 00:03:06,687
That should be enough for now.

53
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:07,654
Good night.

54
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:17,230
I've made a disgrace of myself.

55
00:03:17,297 --> 00:03:18,832
You off now? Good work.

56
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:20,767
Thank you!

57
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:23,870
No dress today?

58
00:03:24,905 --> 00:03:25,939
That's a shame.

59
00:03:26,006 --> 00:03:26,840
Huh?

60
00:03:26,907 --> 00:03:29,142
I guess you wouldn't dress up for work.

61
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,546
You have so many shifts!

62
00:03:32,612 --> 00:03:33,714
You gonna be okay?

63
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:35,549
I'm pretty tough!

64
00:03:35,615 --> 00:03:36,650
But thank you.

65
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:37,617
I'll be careful.

66
00:03:39,553 --> 00:03:41,855
The next day we both have time off

67
00:03:42,656 --> 00:03:43,523
is tomorrow!

68
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,293
Wanna go somewhere?

69
00:03:46,359 --> 00:03:48,628
-What?
-Is that too last-minute?

70
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,630
No, that'd be great!

71
00:03:50,697 --> 00:03:51,698
It's decided then.

72
00:03:52,532 --> 00:03:54,000
I'll text you what time later.

73
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:55,035
Okay!

74
00:03:55,102 --> 00:03:56,636
Thank you!

75
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:03,410
Good for you.

76
00:04:04,311 --> 00:04:05,979
It's not!

77
00:04:07,914 --> 00:04:11,218
What am I going to do tomorrow?

78
00:04:12,719 --> 00:04:13,887
Meet at the cafe.

79
00:04:13,954 --> 00:04:14,788
Okay.

80
00:04:14,855 --> 00:04:15,789
Mr. Hikaru!

81
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:22,295
Please teach me the magic you promised!

82
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:31,004
Today, I'd like you to teach me about
date-night outfits!

83
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,672
That's so stupid.

84
00:04:34,508 --> 00:04:36,209
Date-night outfits

85
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,613
are for luring men
who think they have a chance.

86
00:04:39,679 --> 00:04:41,481
Who do you want to lure?

87
00:04:41,548 --> 00:04:42,549
Mr. Kurotaki!

88
00:04:43,884 --> 00:04:46,920
So why don't you think about
this Kurotaki guy some more.

89
00:04:48,655 --> 00:04:49,623
Right.

90
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:54,661
Although, I really have to
watch my budget.

91
00:04:57,197 --> 00:04:58,698
No dress today?

92
00:04:59,266 --> 00:05:00,534
That's a shame.

93
00:05:02,769 --> 00:05:05,105
Maybe just a dress.

94
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,508
A dress, huh?

95
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:14,347
A dress is a whole outfit,
so that can save you some money.

96
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:23,156
Maybe this one.

97
00:05:30,363 --> 00:05:31,531
Find something you like?

98
00:05:33,033 --> 00:05:33,867
No…

99
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,205
You can start with shoes, too.

100
00:05:40,407 --> 00:05:43,043
But I can't.

101
00:05:43,844 --> 00:05:44,678
Why not?

102
00:05:45,645 --> 00:05:49,049
I've always been self-conscious
about being tall.

103
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:51,985
I'd be a giant in heels.

104
00:05:59,526 --> 00:06:01,061
Don't slouch! Neck back!

105
00:06:01,127 --> 00:06:03,196
Suck your belly in! Chin down!

106
00:06:03,263 --> 00:06:05,599
Stop hiding yourself and be bold!

107
00:06:05,665 --> 00:06:07,234
What's wrong with being tall?

108
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:10,670
See?

109
00:06:10,737 --> 00:06:12,205
That's much better.

110
00:06:14,007 --> 00:06:14,875
It's perfect.

111
00:06:16,810 --> 00:06:18,378
Luckily they were on sale.

112
00:06:19,045 --> 00:06:21,114
I went all out for my first date.

113
00:06:21,181 --> 00:06:24,618
-I'll give you another cabbage as thanks.
-I don't need them.

114
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,019
Seriously, don't.

115
00:06:28,255 --> 00:06:30,724
Anyway, what's going on in your head?

116
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,360
I mean.

117
00:06:34,194 --> 00:06:36,897
People usually shun
cross-dressers, so why?

118
00:06:40,634 --> 00:06:42,736
Why?

119
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,843
Because I wanted
to become friends with you.

120
00:06:54,581 --> 00:06:57,884
Cut that out, you're embarrassing me.

121
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:02,188
Mr. Hikaru. I already know
that you're actually a nice person.

122
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:04,424
I won't get mad from a little teasing.

123
00:07:04,491 --> 00:07:06,493
I didn't mean it like that.

124
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:13,767
All right.

125
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:14,668
Fine.

126
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:18,505
-Huh?
-Just call me Hikaru.

127
00:07:19,606 --> 00:07:20,774
We're friends, right?

128
00:07:21,574 --> 00:07:22,609
And the same age.

129
00:07:22,676 --> 00:07:24,210
Wait, we are?

130
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:26,112
Then I don't need to be formal!

131
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:29,182
You're so shameless!

132
00:07:30,383 --> 00:07:32,519
Then you can call me Haruka.

133
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:34,554
Good to meet you, Hikaru.

134
00:07:37,257 --> 00:07:38,091
Yeah.

135
00:07:40,226 --> 00:07:43,096
So, now that we're friends,

136
00:07:43,163 --> 00:07:45,231
do you have a crush on anyone?

137
00:07:45,298 --> 00:07:47,033
What? That already?

138
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,002
Let's talk love life!

139
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:51,304
Are you seeing anyone now?

140
00:07:53,006 --> 00:07:54,007
You wanna know?

141
00:08:03,283 --> 00:08:04,117
It's a secret.

142
00:08:04,184 --> 00:08:05,352
You idiot.

143
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:07,687
Hey!

144
00:08:08,922 --> 00:08:10,056
Don't worry.

145
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:12,525
I don't date girls who leave bras out.

146
00:08:13,426 --> 00:08:14,861
You saw that?

147
00:08:15,662 --> 00:08:16,763
Dang it!

148
00:08:33,713 --> 00:08:34,748
Hello!

149
00:08:34,814 --> 00:08:35,782
Hey, Haruka.

150
00:08:36,282 --> 00:08:37,117
Can you talk?

151
00:08:37,183 --> 00:08:38,618
Yes, of course!

152
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:39,519
Good.

153
00:08:39,586 --> 00:08:42,455
I was thinking about what to do tomorrow

154
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:47,227
when a friend invited me to
some new product launch party.

155
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,029
You interested?

156
00:08:49,095 --> 00:08:50,130
A party?

157
00:08:51,631 --> 00:08:53,566
You have an impressive friend.

158
00:08:54,501 --> 00:08:56,569
Is it okay that I go, though?

159
00:08:56,636 --> 00:08:57,470
Of course!

160
00:08:58,071 --> 00:09:01,441
It'll be casual,
so you don't need to dress up.

161
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:05,445
I've always wanted to go to a party,
so I'm a little nervous,

162
00:09:05,512 --> 00:09:06,613
but I'd like to go!

163
00:09:07,514 --> 00:09:08,348
Okay!

164
00:09:08,415 --> 00:09:09,749
It's decided.

165
00:09:09,816 --> 00:09:10,650
Yes!

166
00:09:10,717 --> 00:09:11,985
I look forward to it!

167
00:09:12,052 --> 00:09:13,353
I can't wait!

168
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,954
Me, too. See you later.

169
00:09:19,592 --> 00:09:20,660
She's so earnest.

170
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,969
You're going on a date like that?

171
00:09:30,637 --> 00:09:33,406
I actually redid it a bunch of times!

172
00:09:33,473 --> 00:09:34,841
Just to end like that?

173
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,184
Go wash it all off, right now!

174
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,718
-Go!
-Yes! Got it!

175
00:09:58,598 --> 00:09:59,499
Done.

176
00:10:02,302 --> 00:10:03,870
Wow!

177
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:07,107
Now I'm worthy of going on a date
with Mr. Kurotaki.

178
00:10:08,842 --> 00:10:10,176
"Worthy of a date?"

179
00:10:11,411 --> 00:10:12,278
Why submissive?

180
00:10:12,345 --> 00:10:13,413
Because!

181
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,483
Who do you think picked your outfit
and did your makeup?

182
00:10:17,217 --> 00:10:20,987
Are you gonna stand there
and tell me you're still not confident?

183
00:10:21,054 --> 00:10:22,288
Not exactly!

184
00:10:25,892 --> 00:10:28,928
Don't go in thinking
men and women aren't equals.

185
00:10:29,596 --> 00:10:31,264
He'll walk all over you.

186
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,001
Mr. Kurotaki wouldn't do that.

187
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,906
Then don't cling to him and be normal.

188
00:10:40,607 --> 00:10:43,710
Today, you're the cutest you've ever been.

189
00:10:58,791 --> 00:10:59,926
Mr. Kurotaki!

190
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,961
Wow! So cute!

191
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,630
You look great.

192
00:11:03,696 --> 00:11:05,198
-Ready?
-Yes!

193
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,742
Today, you're the cutest you've ever been.

194
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,346
Thank you!

195
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,916
Thank you so much, Hikaru!

196
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,318
I so owe you for this! I'll do anything!

197
00:11:25,385 --> 00:11:27,187
I promise you can count on me!

198
00:11:27,253 --> 00:11:28,621
I love you!

199
00:11:29,989 --> 00:11:30,957
Seriously?

200
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:33,126
Just girls being friends?

201
00:11:34,594 --> 00:11:35,662
Huh?

202
00:11:35,728 --> 00:11:38,064
Is that the new lipstick from Lunelis?

203
00:11:39,566 --> 00:11:41,067
It's just you, Shu.

204
00:11:41,134 --> 00:11:42,068
How could you tell?

205
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:43,903
I mean,

206
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,106
I know everything about you.

207
00:11:47,173 --> 00:11:50,343
I thought that color
would be perfect on you.

208
00:11:52,946 --> 00:11:53,780
Now.

209
00:11:54,781 --> 00:11:55,648
Let's go.

210
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:59,786
Don't be so cold, we're going on a date.

211
00:11:59,852 --> 00:12:01,888
I don't want to be late,
so we have to hurry.

212
00:12:03,289 --> 00:12:04,624
Turn off the lights for me.

213
00:12:04,691 --> 00:12:05,892
Really?

214
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:06,926
Here, too.

215
00:12:09,229 --> 00:12:10,763
Oh, this is where it is.

216
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:11,798
We're here.

217
00:12:13,433 --> 00:12:15,902
Hi, here's my invitation. Thanks.

218
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,905
-This is amazing.
-Yes, it is!

219
00:12:18,972 --> 00:12:19,973
Keisuke!

220
00:12:20,873 --> 00:12:22,108
-Long time!
-Yeah!

221
00:12:22,875 --> 00:12:24,978
Last I saw you was Tomoki's birthday?

222
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:26,246
-I think so.
-Right?

223
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:28,081
Long time no see!

224
00:12:53,039 --> 00:12:56,776
Um, I met Nick while I was studying abroad
through my roommate.

225
00:13:09,422 --> 00:13:11,791
That guy's so amazing.

226
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,060
So cool.

227
00:13:14,661 --> 00:13:17,430
You seem pretty amazing yourself,
from my perspective.

228
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:21,000
I had no idea
what you were saying just now.

229
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,570
He asked me if I came with a friend.

230
00:13:25,271 --> 00:13:27,373
How do you say "work friend" in English?

231
00:13:28,775 --> 00:13:29,609
I don't know.

232
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:33,313
I told him I came with someone special.

233
00:13:36,282 --> 00:13:37,383
Are you okay?

234
00:13:38,117 --> 00:13:39,752
I'm totally fine.

235
00:13:42,221 --> 00:13:44,324
Is this your first time on a date?

236
00:13:44,891 --> 00:13:47,360
Will he be mortified if it is?

237
00:13:48,961 --> 00:13:51,164
No, it's just been a while.

238
00:13:53,499 --> 00:13:55,034
Did that work?

239
00:13:55,902 --> 00:13:56,736
I see.

240
00:13:57,737 --> 00:13:59,505
Do you like specialty shops?

241
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,774
Yes, of course!

242
00:14:02,342 --> 00:14:04,677
I'm lying! I've never been to one!

243
00:14:05,778 --> 00:14:08,047
That looks so good!

244
00:14:08,114 --> 00:14:09,716
-Which do you want?
-Oh, my!

245
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:13,019
This one, and this one.

246
00:14:13,086 --> 00:14:14,987
That's amazing.

247
00:14:16,489 --> 00:14:17,323
Ow.

248
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:22,195
Those are nice shoes!

249
00:14:24,197 --> 00:14:26,099
You like this bold design?

250
00:14:26,165 --> 00:14:27,734
-Yes.
-That's unexpected.

251
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,336
I'm lying! My feet hurt so bad!

252
00:14:30,403 --> 00:14:31,904
-Kurotaki.
-Yes?

253
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:33,973
One sec.

254
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:36,376
-It's been a while.
-It has.

255
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:37,944
You're doing Nick's shoot?

256
00:14:46,619 --> 00:14:49,389
-Thank you for inviting me today.
-Of course.

257
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:53,793
It hurts so much
I'm hearing Hikaru's voice in my head.

258
00:14:58,164 --> 00:14:59,165
Hikaru!

259
00:15:00,967 --> 00:15:02,235
Why are you here?

260
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:07,273
I came with my nepo-baby classmate.

261
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:09,375
His dad is the CEO of Kiriya.

262
00:15:10,243 --> 00:15:12,011
As in the cosmetic brand?

263
00:15:12,078 --> 00:15:13,413
Even I've heard of them.

264
00:15:13,479 --> 00:15:14,280
Thanks.

265
00:15:15,515 --> 00:15:16,682
I'm Shu Kiriya.

266
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:19,352
Um.

267
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:21,254
How do you know Hikaru?

268
00:15:22,121 --> 00:15:25,525
I'm Haruka Fukunaga, and he's teaching me
how to do makeup.

269
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:28,861
You came alone?

270
00:15:28,928 --> 00:15:30,496
No, I'm here with a friend.

271
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,404
Then let's both enjoy our dates.

272
00:15:39,038 --> 00:15:40,039
Excuse me?

273
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:41,441
Okay.

274
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:43,209
Get off me, Shu.

275
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:44,811
Go say hello to everyone.

276
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:46,512
Okay, fine.

277
00:15:46,579 --> 00:15:47,880
Please, excuse me.

278
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:57,457
Haruka.

279
00:15:59,258 --> 00:16:00,193
Sorry.

280
00:16:00,259 --> 00:16:03,262
You gave me so much advice,

281
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:06,199
but I'm just no good.

282
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,971
I don't know what happened,

283
00:16:12,038 --> 00:16:14,607
but there's nothing
that's no good about you today.

284
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:17,176
Hikaru.

285
00:16:17,243 --> 00:16:18,478
If there was,

286
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,380
it's that ugly, unconfident face.

287
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,915
That's harsh!

288
00:16:22,982 --> 00:16:24,484
Beautiful people

289
00:16:25,084 --> 00:16:27,086
are people with confidence.

290
00:16:33,793 --> 00:16:36,596
You went through the trouble
of casting a spell on me

291
00:16:37,864 --> 00:16:40,132
but I have to change on the inside.

292
00:16:43,736 --> 00:16:44,871
I shouldn't tell lies.

293
00:16:45,872 --> 00:16:47,340
It'll make me hate myself.

294
00:16:49,609 --> 00:16:50,443
What is it?

295
00:16:54,413 --> 00:16:56,449
Thank you, Hikaru.

296
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:58,951
Sorry, Haruka!

297
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,553
I got caught up.

298
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:01,587
It's okay!

299
00:17:04,457 --> 00:17:05,324
Um,

300
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,193
Mr. Kurotaki!

301
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,129
I'm sorry.

302
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:12,265
The truth is,

303
00:17:13,332 --> 00:17:14,567
I was lying to you.

304
00:17:16,002 --> 00:17:17,470
To be honest,

305
00:17:18,037 --> 00:17:21,440
this is the first date
I've ever been on in my life.

306
00:17:23,342 --> 00:17:27,046
I was scared by our difference
in life experience

307
00:17:27,113 --> 00:17:28,614
and tried to play it off.

308
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,284
I'm sorry for lying!

309
00:17:33,419 --> 00:17:35,254
But, I don't

310
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:38,257
want to leave yet.

311
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:40,760
I might be overstepping,

312
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:43,763
but I want to continue our date.

313
00:17:51,237 --> 00:17:52,271
Thanks, Haruka.

314
00:17:54,307 --> 00:17:57,476
But seriously, I'm nobody that special.

315
00:17:58,811 --> 00:18:03,316
Also, I did get the sense
you weren't that used to this.

316
00:18:04,317 --> 00:18:08,220
But you still put in a lot of effort
dressing up for today.

317
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:10,756
Thanks, I'm honored.

318
00:18:15,227 --> 00:18:19,098
Wait here, I'll grab us dessert! Okay?

319
00:18:25,404 --> 00:18:26,305
Good for you.

320
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,475
You hurt your feet?

321
00:18:30,643 --> 00:18:31,944
How did you know?

322
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,613
Who do you think I am?

323
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,247
I forgot.

324
00:18:36,048 --> 00:18:37,450
Why did you whisper that?

325
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:42,021
It wouldn't be good
if Kurotaki finds out I'm a guy, right?

326
00:18:43,456 --> 00:18:44,757
Why is that?

327
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,194
What do you mean, why?

328
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:54,900
Who wants a guy pretending to be a girl
coming near the girl you're interested in.

329
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:56,535
It's uncomfortable, at least.

330
00:18:58,437 --> 00:19:00,973
If someone is bothered by that,

331
00:19:01,674 --> 00:19:04,543
I'd stop liking them, even Mr. Kurotaki.

332
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:10,549
But there's no way he would be.

333
00:19:12,952 --> 00:19:15,221
Anyway, show me your feet.

334
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,124
I'm fine! See?

335
00:19:18,190 --> 00:19:19,325
Look at me!

336
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:27,733
Put me down, you'll break your arm!

337
00:19:27,800 --> 00:19:29,769
They wouldn't break from this.

338
00:19:29,835 --> 00:19:31,637
But I'm heavy.

339
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,372
-It's fine.
-Haruka?

340
00:19:39,645 --> 00:19:40,613
What's going on?

341
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,916
Oh, crap.

342
00:19:49,422 --> 00:19:51,424
-I'm bunking with her?
-Is that a problem?

343
00:19:52,291 --> 00:19:54,760
Must be nice being so happy-go-lucky.

344
00:19:54,827 --> 00:19:55,861
I bet she likes that.

345
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:58,898
How do you think of me right now,
Mr. Kurotaki?

346
00:19:58,964 --> 00:20:01,067
I have the most fun
being with you, Hikaru.

347
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:01,901
Do it for me.

348
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,369
Why did you drink so much?

349
00:20:03,436 --> 00:20:04,837
