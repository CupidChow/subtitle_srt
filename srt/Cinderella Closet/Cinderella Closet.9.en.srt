1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:06,606
I want you to model for me.

2
00:00:06,673 --> 00:00:07,874
Chin down.

3
00:00:07,941 --> 00:00:10,477
Mr. Kurotaki. Thank you.

4
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:13,413
<i>While it was short, I had fun dating you.</i>

5
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,149
<i>It's so fun doing this with you, Hikaru.</i>

6
00:00:16,216 --> 00:00:19,219
Keep that up and some other guy
will take her away.

7
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:23,423
Wait, where's Hikaru?

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:25,592
He had too much to drink.

9
00:00:25,658 --> 00:00:27,894
Shu helped him to another room.

10
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:31,364
Hikaru?

11
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:17,744
I'm so sorry, I know I'm the one
who planned this

12
00:01:17,811 --> 00:01:19,612
but I'm so behind on editing!

13
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:21,948
It's okay, I'm happy you invited me.

14
00:01:22,449 --> 00:01:24,918
It's so impressive how you rented
an office!

15
00:01:24,984 --> 00:01:27,687
I'll have to work extra hard
so it's worth it.

16
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:30,824
This is for you for coming all this way.

17
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:32,659
This much?

18
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:35,795
I get a ton of products from sponsors.

19
00:01:35,862 --> 00:01:37,063
Please, take them.

20
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,731
Thank you!

21
00:01:40,934 --> 00:01:43,736
I just want to tell you again
how well you did.

22
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,205
You earned first place.

23
00:01:46,039 --> 00:01:47,874
It was all Hikaru and his team.

24
00:01:47,941 --> 00:01:51,711
I mean, sure, Hikaru is very talented.

25
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:55,748
But…

26
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:00,854
Huh? What?

27
00:02:02,655 --> 00:02:05,558
The fact that he won first place

28
00:02:05,625 --> 00:02:08,828
means that he'll easily find a good job.

29
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:14,634
Isn't that a good thing?

30
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:16,736
Of course not!

31
00:02:16,803 --> 00:02:19,472
<i>My dream of running a couple channel</i>
<i>is in jeopardy!</i>

32
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:20,974
You were serious about it?

33
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:22,408
I was super serious!

34
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:25,111
He was born to be a star!

35
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:29,782
Please try not to trouble Hikaru too much.

36
00:02:31,618 --> 00:02:35,255
You must really love Hikaru.

37
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:36,156
I do!

38
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,594
Wait, you love him?

39
00:02:41,661 --> 00:02:42,562
Yes!

40
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:43,963
He's my dearest friend.

41
00:02:44,664 --> 00:02:46,666
He's the most important person to me.

42
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:49,769
Hold on a sec.

43
00:02:50,403 --> 00:02:52,705
Is that something you say about a friend?

44
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:55,575
What's with your relationship?

45
00:02:56,442 --> 00:02:59,145
But that's how I really feel.

46
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:03,650
Hikaru is always helping me.

47
00:03:04,617 --> 00:03:05,985
But he's not just kind,

48
00:03:06,586 --> 00:03:08,855
he gives me tough love too.

49
00:03:12,025 --> 00:03:16,563
If I had someone like that,
I'd fall in love with them instantly.

50
00:03:17,931 --> 00:03:20,533
I mean, that kind of person is so rare.

51
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:24,337
It seems like a waste
to keep them as just a friend.

52
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:38,585
But I still think
he's my most important friend.

53
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:42,889
I mean, Hikaru said
he has a crush already.

54
00:03:44,357 --> 00:03:46,859
A crush, right?

55
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:11,050
Excuse me.

56
00:04:11,117 --> 00:04:13,920
Hey, Haruka. Thanks for coming.

57
00:04:13,987 --> 00:04:15,488
It was on my way.

58
00:04:16,389 --> 00:04:18,224
Shu wanted to give you this.

59
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:21,928
It's all makeup from our own brand.

60
00:04:22,528 --> 00:04:24,030
For me? Why?

61
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,565
For modeling for us.

62
00:04:27,133 --> 00:04:30,370
I'm happy Hikaru was able to
realize his vision.

63
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:37,410
You shouldn't have! I also got
a special experience out of it.

64
00:04:38,011 --> 00:04:40,013
Hikaru, got a sec?

65
00:04:40,079 --> 00:04:41,581
Be right there.

66
00:04:41,648 --> 00:04:42,615
Sorry.

67
00:04:43,783 --> 00:04:45,885
I thought it lacked impact.

68
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:49,389
Photographs aren't as vibrant as seeing
with the naked eye.

69
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:53,359
Maybe add more blush and lipstick
for a ruddier look.

70
00:04:54,093 --> 00:04:56,262
Hikaru is popular, isn't he?

71
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:01,334
Everyone relies on him
because he has an eye for detail.

72
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:07,407
You really understand Hikaru well.

73
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:11,044
I know him better than anyone.

74
00:05:11,911 --> 00:05:13,880
So ask me anything about him.

75
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:21,721
I didn't know what he was like in school.

76
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,024
Or actually,

77
00:05:25,091 --> 00:05:29,395
maybe I don't know him very well at all.

78
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,966
So I'm really happy I got to see
so many different sides of him.

79
00:05:38,838 --> 00:05:40,006
Want to know more?

80
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:43,376
About us.

81
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:47,680
About us?

82
00:05:50,016 --> 00:05:51,818
Do you like Hikaru?

83
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,055
Of course, he's a very important friend.

84
00:05:56,789 --> 00:05:58,725
I love beautiful things.

85
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:00,860
Also,

86
00:06:01,427 --> 00:06:02,729
beautiful people.

87
00:06:05,131 --> 00:06:06,599
If you're Hikaru's friend,

88
00:06:07,166 --> 00:06:08,935
I have a favor to ask.

89
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:10,403
What?

90
00:06:12,271 --> 00:06:13,606
Could you root for us?

91
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:16,709
For my future with Hikaru?

92
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,566
Where's Haruka?

93
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:44,404
Said she needed fresh air.

94
00:06:45,371 --> 00:06:46,205
Why?

95
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:48,174
No idea.

96
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:01,387
These were all done by our students.

97
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:06,025
Haruka?

98
00:07:07,827 --> 00:07:08,661
Haruka?

99
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,268
Don't go!

100
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:17,503
I'm sorry.

101
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,740
I know I should support you as a friend.

102
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:22,575
But I can't.

103
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,012
I want to be with you longer.

104
00:07:27,713 --> 00:07:29,248
Wait, hold on.

105
00:07:29,315 --> 00:07:30,283
What's wrong?

106
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:35,922
Did Shu say something?

107
00:07:36,789 --> 00:07:37,623
Hikaru.

108
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,260
Aren't you going to Korea?

109
00:07:42,261 --> 00:07:43,196
What?

110
00:07:44,897 --> 00:07:47,366
I'll take over the company eventually,

111
00:07:47,433 --> 00:07:51,604
so after graduation,
I'm going to our Korea branch to learn.

112
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,909
This is my last year of freedom.

113
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,645
I want to take Hikaru with me.

114
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:01,280
What?

115
00:08:04,851 --> 00:08:06,853
Plus, he also said he wanted to go.

116
00:08:10,323 --> 00:08:13,960
Hikaru's good enough
to be a key player for us right away.

117
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,431
Korea?

118
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,268
<i>It's actually not too far, right?</i>

119
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:24,504
<i>How much is the plane fare?</i>

120
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:26,672
<i>Are there super budget options?</i>

121
00:08:27,173 --> 00:08:30,009
<i>Wait, I need to get a passport first.</i>

122
00:08:31,244 --> 00:08:32,044
Haruka?

123
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,380
<i>Where could I stay?</i>

124
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:36,749
<i>It's too far for me.</i>

125
00:08:36,816 --> 00:08:37,617
Haruka?

126
00:08:38,484 --> 00:08:42,355
<i>Will I not be able to see Hikaru</i>
<i>all the time anymore?</i>

127
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:49,228
- Listen--
- Also!

128
00:08:49,795 --> 00:08:50,630
I'm sorry.

129
00:08:51,797 --> 00:08:54,967
I didn't mean to see it.

130
00:08:58,070 --> 00:08:59,038
<i>You two</i>

131
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:01,641
are dating, aren't you?

132
00:09:03,576 --> 00:09:05,745
Geez. You've got it all wrong.

133
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,146
Let me explain.

134
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,315
You okay, Hikaru?

135
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:10,583
Totally fine.

136
00:09:15,955 --> 00:09:16,989
Sit down.

137
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,337
I drank too much.

138
00:09:31,404 --> 00:09:33,105
I got carried away from winning.

139
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:38,077
But you're still going to Korea, right?

140
00:09:39,111 --> 00:09:40,813
That stupid Shu.

141
00:09:42,481 --> 00:09:45,117
Haruka, Shu was messing with you.

142
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:46,919
Huh?

143
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:51,857
I mean, I did mention
wanting to study makeup in Korea,

144
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,693
but it's nothing permanent.

145
00:09:55,094 --> 00:09:55,995
Then

146
00:09:56,829 --> 00:09:59,298
you're not going anywhere?

147
00:10:00,232 --> 00:10:01,701
Of course not.

148
00:10:02,568 --> 00:10:05,972
He's got a habit of teasing people
for his enjoyment.

149
00:10:07,373 --> 00:10:09,575
Thank goodness!

150
00:10:09,642 --> 00:10:11,844
I'm so relieved!

151
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:19,919
It's okay.

152
00:10:19,986 --> 00:10:20,953
Don't worry.

153
00:10:24,523 --> 00:10:26,192
I'll always be with you.

154
00:10:31,797 --> 00:10:33,032
<i>My heart is screaming.</i>

155
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,835
<i>That it has to be Hikaru.</i>

156
00:10:42,541 --> 00:10:43,442
Feel better?

157
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:44,977
Yeah.

158
00:10:46,278 --> 00:10:47,313
Thank you.

159
00:10:49,548 --> 00:10:51,417
You blew it way out of proportion.

160
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,853
You hate the idea that much?

161
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:56,489
Yeah.

162
00:10:57,590 --> 00:10:58,591
Of course I do.

163
00:10:59,759 --> 00:11:01,394
I don't want you going away.

164
00:11:06,899 --> 00:11:10,202
I just want to make one thing clear,
so you don't misunderstand.

165
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:14,006
The person I like is a girl.

166
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:26,786
<i>But that doesn't change the fact</i>
<i>that he has a crush already.</i>

167
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,362
<i>I wonder what that girl is like.</i>

168
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:41,934
Hey, now.

169
00:11:42,668 --> 00:11:43,869
I didn't lie.

170
00:11:44,503 --> 00:11:45,337
Excuse me?

171
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:49,775
Wanting to take you to Korea,

172
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:51,944
and me liking you are both true.

173
00:11:52,878 --> 00:11:54,113
I've told you.

174
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:58,184
Look,

175
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:00,252
I feel sorry for you, but--

176
00:12:00,319 --> 00:12:01,987
That's cold.

177
00:12:03,189 --> 00:12:04,690
We shared a hotel room.

178
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:08,327
- I was super drunk!
- Yeah, yeah.

179
00:12:09,061 --> 00:12:12,264
The night you took me into a hotel
when we were drunk

180
00:12:12,331 --> 00:12:14,767
but in the end, you turned me down.

181
00:12:16,969 --> 00:12:17,803
Sorry.

182
00:12:20,539 --> 00:12:22,641
But I'm grateful to you.

183
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,045
Huh?

184
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:31,851
I learned something important
about myself that night.

185
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:38,257
You mean whether you're into men or women?

186
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:41,460
I'm sorry.

187
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,132
Again? Look at your face.

188
00:12:47,867 --> 00:12:49,435
You're way too careless.

189
00:12:50,636 --> 00:12:53,706
Did you think I'd back off
from one rejection?

190
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:58,344
I do like you.

191
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:00,780
But

192
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,382
just as a friend.

193
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,720
The one I love is Haruka.

194
00:13:09,421 --> 00:13:12,458
Sorry for not saying it before.

195
00:13:14,994 --> 00:13:17,863
See, I knew it was romantic love.

196
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,065
I'm not sure.

197
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,401
So when are you telling Hikaru?

198
00:13:22,468 --> 00:13:24,136
I can't! No way!

199
00:13:25,304 --> 00:13:27,973
Is it even romantic love?

200
00:13:29,341 --> 00:13:31,811
Didn't you invite me over
to talk about love advice?

201
00:13:34,747 --> 00:13:38,217
I don't really understand how I feel.

202
00:13:42,288 --> 00:13:44,924
When I had feelings for Mr. Kurotaki,

203
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,659
I was excited every day.

204
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:49,361
But I don't have that with Hikaru.

205
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:55,734
When I'm with Hikaru,
I feel more at ease.

206
00:13:55,801 --> 00:13:57,269
I feel secure.

207
00:13:57,336 --> 00:14:00,806
Having butterflies isn't the only sign
that you're in love.

208
00:14:00,873 --> 00:14:02,274
What, really?

209
00:14:03,742 --> 00:14:06,779
But Hikaru and I are friends.

210
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,384
Yet I got really upset when I thought
he might be going abroad.

211
00:14:14,753 --> 00:14:16,522
You're overthinking it.

212
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,527
But I liked Mr. Kurotaki
up until a few days ago.

213
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,495
Aren't I being too casual?

214
00:14:23,562 --> 00:14:25,965
Seriously? You're so fussy.

215
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:30,936
Look, being able to love one person
and one person only is great,

216
00:14:31,003 --> 00:14:36,141
but romantic love can make it hard
to be able to control your feelings.

217
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:40,212
Running away, ignoring your feelings

218
00:14:40,946 --> 00:14:42,514
can lead you to regret it.

219
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,018
Is this what you really want?

220
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:59,899
Have you ever felt this way before, too?

221
00:15:00,599 --> 00:15:01,433
Huh?

222
00:15:04,703 --> 00:15:05,971
I…

223
00:15:11,076 --> 00:15:12,845
Someone's talking about you.

224
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,147
Must be nice to have so many admirers.

225
00:15:15,214 --> 00:15:17,149
You know I got dumped.

226
00:15:20,986 --> 00:15:23,122
Maybe I'll ask someone out for drinks.

227
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,824
Instead of going out for drinks,

228
00:15:25,891 --> 00:15:29,028
maybe spend some time alone
to self-reflect.

229
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,398
- Order up!
- Coming.

230
00:15:33,299 --> 00:15:38,237
Like what it is that you really want to do
or who you have feelings for.

231
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:45,444
Have you told Haruka how you feel?

232
00:15:46,011 --> 00:15:46,845
No.

233
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,348
She just got out of a relationship.

234
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,750
I'm pretty sure she likes you, though.

235
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:52,952
That's just her

236
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,088
seeing me as a girl-friend.

237
00:15:56,956 --> 00:16:00,826
I'm nothing like her ex, either.

238
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:03,629
What?

239
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:05,331
Nothing.

240
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,900
Just come out and say it.

241
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:12,471
I already knew you're a scaredy-cat.

242
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:14,440
Excuse me? Scared?

243
00:16:15,174 --> 00:16:16,208
Yup.

244
00:16:16,275 --> 00:16:20,279
Haruka is single now,
so why are you hesitating?

245
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:23,782
Look at me.

246
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,819
She doesn't see me as a man.

247
00:16:29,421 --> 00:16:30,289
You think?

248
00:16:31,590 --> 00:16:33,592
The first time I saw you,

249
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:37,463
I thought you were beautiful,
shifting between the genders.

250
00:16:40,466 --> 00:16:44,737
But to you, it's more like your armor.

251
00:16:46,905 --> 00:16:49,908
Are you less confident without your magic?
When you're a guy?

252
00:16:54,947 --> 00:16:56,582
The <i>takoyaki</i> was yummy.

253
00:16:56,648 --> 00:16:57,816
Please come again.

254
00:16:57,883 --> 00:17:01,553
Happy to give advice about your love life
anytime you want.

255
00:17:02,588 --> 00:17:06,759
You know, I think you should
just tell Hikaru how you feel.

256
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:11,563
No way, I can't do something that scary!

257
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:15,300
But you wouldn't like to see Hikaru
date someone else, right?

258
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:20,272
Well, I suppose I wouldn't.

259
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,941
But…

260
00:17:23,509 --> 00:17:24,343
What?

261
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:29,214
I'd hate losing what we have
right now even more.

262
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:32,217
I'd rather stay friends.

263
00:17:33,819 --> 00:17:35,788
I prefer being friends.

264
00:17:35,854 --> 00:17:39,291
You're making things so difficult!

265
00:18:07,519 --> 00:18:08,954
Hello, Hikaru?

266
00:18:09,021 --> 00:18:10,322
Haruka.

267
00:18:19,164 --> 00:18:20,365
What is it?

268
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:25,704
Let's go out on a date.

269
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,152
Okay.

270
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:58,170
Friends go out on dates too, right?

271
00:19:02,708 --> 00:19:05,244
<i>I can't let him find out.</i>

272
00:19:16,121 --> 00:19:19,191
<i>I can be with him forever</i>
<i>as long as we're friends.</i>

273
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:51,490
Apparently, this is a date spot.

274
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,259
Leave today to me, all you have to do
is be with me.

275
00:19:54,326 --> 00:19:57,362
Nothing wrong with the girl
making the first move.

276
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,998
It will be awkward
if he finds out how I feel.

277
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:01,900
I don't want to lie to you anymore.

278
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:02,801
Listen, I…

279
00:20:02,868 --> 00:20:04,970
