1
00:00:09,142 --> 00:00:11,111
Hikaru? You know them?

2
00:00:12,645 --> 00:00:14,714
You bring shame to the Kamiyama family!

3
00:00:21,755 --> 00:00:23,323
You haven't fixed it at all.

4
00:00:23,390 --> 00:00:24,290
Dear.

5
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:26,559
Why're you here?

6
00:00:26,626 --> 00:00:27,627
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,430
We saw the school's homepage.

8
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:32,098
You didn't even go to college.

9
00:00:32,766 --> 00:00:35,568
How can you walk around town wearing that?

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:38,104
Do what you want.

11
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,707
I'm disowning you.

12
00:00:41,241 --> 00:00:42,642
It's an embarrassment.

13
00:00:43,276 --> 00:00:45,945
Having someone like you as a son.

14
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:50,316
Please apologize.

15
00:00:52,352 --> 00:00:53,486
Who are you?

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:57,323
You just said something awful to Hikaru.

17
00:00:57,390 --> 00:00:58,792
Please apologize.

18
00:00:59,526 --> 00:01:01,194
It's fine, I'm used to it.

19
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:03,863
You shouldn't be fine, nor used to it!

20
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,801
This doesn't pertain to you.

21
00:01:08,368 --> 00:01:09,569
But it does.

22
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:14,240
Hikaru is the most important person
in my life.

23
00:01:14,874 --> 00:01:17,410
I won't let anyone hurt him,
not even his family!

24
00:01:20,947 --> 00:01:24,017
Is dressing the way you like,
doing what you like

25
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,019
such a terrible thing?

26
00:01:28,321 --> 00:01:30,090
You aren't looking at him.

27
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,724
Please look at who he is!

28
00:01:31,791 --> 00:01:33,126
It's okay, Haruka.

29
00:01:34,994 --> 00:01:35,829
Let's go.

30
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,422
Stop crying already.

31
00:02:02,922 --> 00:02:04,324
Your eyes will get puffy.

32
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:07,360
But…

33
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:11,731
Why are you laughing?

34
00:02:12,398 --> 00:02:13,433
Sorry.

35
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:16,736
Thank you.

36
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:20,773
You know, I'll be fine
as long as you're here..

37
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:22,775
You were cool.

38
00:02:23,443 --> 00:02:24,611
But still…

39
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:29,816
I want you to model for me.

40
00:02:30,383 --> 00:02:31,184
What?

41
00:02:32,118 --> 00:02:33,052
What do you say?

42
00:02:35,588 --> 00:02:36,756
I'll do it!

43
00:02:36,823 --> 00:02:37,957
I'll do my best!

44
00:02:42,762 --> 00:02:44,697
I'm doing it. I can do it.

45
00:02:45,365 --> 00:02:46,199
Alright!

46
00:02:52,205 --> 00:02:53,940
Good work today.

47
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,578
You cut your hair.

48
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,481
Yes, Hikaru cut it for me.

49
00:03:01,548 --> 00:03:02,949
It looks great on--

50
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,453
No, I shouldn't be so insensitive.

51
00:03:10,657 --> 00:03:13,359
It's hard not to feel a little nervous.

52
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,032
I'm so glad we can talk normally.

53
00:03:20,433 --> 00:03:21,267
Thanks.

54
00:03:21,334 --> 00:03:25,104
No, please, I'm the one
who gave you the run around.

55
00:03:25,171 --> 00:03:26,706
- I'm sorry.
- No, not at all.

56
00:03:28,007 --> 00:03:29,642
I'm sure I'm to blame, too.

57
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,512
Anyway, that's enough of this.

58
00:03:40,453 --> 00:03:43,489
You're not going to ask me anything
about it, are you?

59
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,729
You didn't even ask me why,
when I told you I wanted to break up.

60
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,334
You don't even want to complain to me?

61
00:03:58,338 --> 00:03:59,872
It wouldn't change anything.

62
00:04:01,774 --> 00:04:03,943
A guy can't be pushy after getting dumped.

63
00:04:07,013 --> 00:04:10,650
Okay, that wasn't cool at all.

64
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,557
What're you laughing for?

65
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:21,794
I mean…

66
00:04:23,229 --> 00:04:25,832
What kind of reason is that?

67
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:32,772
Mr. Kurotaki.

68
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:34,974
Thank you.

69
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:39,879
While it was short, I had fun dating you.

70
00:04:45,685 --> 00:04:49,122
I had fun dating you, too.

71
00:04:56,462 --> 00:04:57,864
You got this.

72
00:05:01,401 --> 00:05:04,937
So you do a set of that
before your skin care routine, okay?

73
00:05:05,004 --> 00:05:05,938
Okay!

74
00:05:06,005 --> 00:05:08,474
First, use a beauty booster serum.

75
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:09,776
Then lotion.

76
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:12,278
Then, apply this eye cream under the eyes.

77
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:14,681
Now, face masks. Use this one at night.

78
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:15,948
H-Hold on!

79
00:05:16,516 --> 00:05:17,784
What's a booster?

80
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,018
Chest out.

81
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,554
Okay, stop, Haruka.

82
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:23,122
You're a mess.

83
00:05:23,856 --> 00:05:24,991
- First, chest out.
- Okay.

84
00:05:25,058 --> 00:05:26,159
Chin down.

85
00:05:26,659 --> 00:05:28,561
Now stand straight.

86
00:05:29,128 --> 00:05:30,163
How's it going?

87
00:05:30,830 --> 00:05:31,698
Smoothly.

88
00:05:32,932 --> 00:05:35,968
She's moving all weird.
Is she going to be okay?

89
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,638
He said he wanted Haruka to do it.

90
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:45,345
One, two…

91
00:05:46,179 --> 00:05:50,249
Walk straight.

92
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:51,684
Right.

93
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:54,120
Left.

94
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:55,822
Then turn.

95
00:05:56,989 --> 00:05:58,124
Isn't that Miorin?

96
00:06:00,059 --> 00:06:01,160
Ms. Miorin?

97
00:06:04,497 --> 00:06:05,765
Hello.

98
00:06:08,534 --> 00:06:11,104
Is it my fault you broke up with Keisuke?

99
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:12,605
What?

100
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:16,376
Sorry, I know I totally suck for asking,

101
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:20,413
but if that's the case,
I have to apologize.

102
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:21,381
No.

103
00:06:29,889 --> 00:06:31,190
To be honest,

104
00:06:32,091 --> 00:06:34,961
it's just what got the ball rolling.

105
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:42,602
The number one reason is that
we didn't build a proper relationship.

106
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:48,608
So, it's really not your fault.

107
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:54,414
Please don't worry about it
and don't act any differently.

108
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:58,551
I'm sorry.

109
00:06:59,252 --> 00:07:01,721
Ever since I ran into Keisuke,

110
00:07:01,788 --> 00:07:04,791
I wanted to make him regret losing me.

111
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:10,630
I know you see me as his ex,
so you shouldn't be nice to me.

112
00:07:11,297 --> 00:07:13,032
But I got myself involved too much,

113
00:07:14,467 --> 00:07:17,236
I don't deserve your concern.

114
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:21,941
Please, I'm not forcing myself to be nice.

115
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,911
If you'd like,

116
00:07:25,978 --> 00:07:28,214
would you be my friend?

117
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,550
Really?

118
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,517
Yes!

119
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,687
<i>You broke up?</i>

120
00:07:35,254 --> 00:07:36,122
She dumped you?

121
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:38,157
Huh? Why do you think that?

122
00:07:38,224 --> 00:07:40,526
Because Haruka seemed fine.

123
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:43,830
Kids these days get over it fast.

124
00:07:46,365 --> 00:07:48,267
No. I think…

125
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:52,839
she was trying not to
make it awkward between us.

126
00:08:00,847 --> 00:08:05,184
You understand a girl's feelings,
even though you're just Kurotaki.

127
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:08,588
Hey, I've grown in my own way, you know?

128
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:09,522
So cheeky.

129
00:08:09,589 --> 00:08:12,391
Come on! That's a bit harsh.

130
00:08:12,458 --> 00:08:14,293
"I've grown, you know."

131
00:08:15,394 --> 00:08:16,562
So gross.

132
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:22,502
So cute!

133
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:24,770
Hey, Shu.

134
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:26,606
What do you think?

135
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:29,242
Maybe some more brightness.

136
00:08:29,909 --> 00:08:31,277
Maybe this color?

137
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:33,112
Oh, good idea.

138
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:34,614
Thanks.

139
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,915
It's a pretty color.

140
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,885
Also, this gold has larger glitter
than the shimmery one,

141
00:08:38,951 --> 00:08:41,387
letting them catch the light better.

142
00:08:41,454 --> 00:08:42,288
Right.

143
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:52,565
Here are your skewers.

144
00:08:52,632 --> 00:08:53,900
- Excuse me.
- Yes?

145
00:08:55,034 --> 00:08:56,435
Are you ready to order?

146
00:09:01,407 --> 00:09:02,808
You're still doing that?

147
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,813
You need more sleep.

148
00:09:10,383 --> 00:09:11,617
I know that.

149
00:09:18,691 --> 00:09:21,260
HIKARU KAMIYAMA "EMERGENCE"

150
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,764
You aren't looking at him.

151
00:09:24,830 --> 00:09:26,499
Please look at who he is!

152
00:09:31,203 --> 00:09:32,204
Welcome home.

153
00:09:32,972 --> 00:09:33,906
Thank you.

154
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:35,608
Let me get you your dinner.

155
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,677
What's that?

156
00:09:42,048 --> 00:09:44,116
I thought I'd go to the school show.

157
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:45,918
Let it rest.

158
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:48,254
He's no longer our son.

159
00:09:57,163 --> 00:09:59,332
INCOMING CALL
MOTHER

160
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:08,908
Sorry, I'm here.

161
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:10,343
Hikaru!

162
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:11,777
What?!

163
00:10:12,712 --> 00:10:15,014
Jeez, what are you even doing?

164
00:10:15,081 --> 00:10:18,217
I thought deeper-set eyes would look cool.

165
00:10:19,852 --> 00:10:22,655
All right, I'll teach you next time.

166
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,856
Now, get that off.

167
00:10:26,225 --> 00:10:27,293
Here.

168
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:28,628
Thank you.

169
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:37,336
I wanted to revise the lighting.

170
00:10:38,804 --> 00:10:39,772
Okay.

171
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,040
I'll send it over right now.

172
00:10:41,107 --> 00:10:41,974
Thanks.

173
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:07,600
You're still here?

174
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,168
You should head home soon.

175
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:10,569
Just a little more.

176
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:18,110
I'm actually having fun doing this.

177
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,512
Huh?

178
00:11:20,046 --> 00:11:22,548
You're always the one
who's helping me out.

179
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,251
So I took this on, thinking it's my turn.

180
00:11:25,818 --> 00:11:27,453
The makeup and outfit are pretty,

181
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,390
and most of all,
it's so fun doing this with you, Hikaru.

182
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:35,594
Me, too.

183
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:38,030
I'm glad you're our model.

184
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,768
Okay, here goes Haruka Fukunaga!

185
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,876
- Sorry!
- You okay?

186
00:12:00,453 --> 00:12:01,620
You startled me.

187
00:12:01,687 --> 00:12:02,688
What happened?

188
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:04,757
The heel's broken!

189
00:12:04,824 --> 00:12:06,025
Are you hurt?

190
00:12:06,792 --> 00:12:07,993
I'm fine.

191
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:08,928
That's good.

192
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,263
It's late. Let's go home.

193
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:12,965
I'll get my things.

194
00:12:14,633 --> 00:12:15,468
Okay.

195
00:12:21,974 --> 00:12:23,709
Get it together.

196
00:12:24,777 --> 00:12:25,911
Calm down.

197
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:28,914
Ow!

198
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,150
That hurts.

199
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:48,400
What's wrong? Nervous already?

200
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:50,369
Well, yeah, it's tomorrow!

201
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,138
Too soon.

202
00:12:55,241 --> 00:12:57,109
Hikaru, got a sec?

203
00:12:59,678 --> 00:13:00,946
Sorry, just a moment.

204
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:01,881
Sure!

205
00:13:03,716 --> 00:13:04,750
Where does it hurt?

206
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,987
- Your arm? Shoulder?
- I'm fine.

207
00:13:11,023 --> 00:13:13,492
- I can still use my hand.
- You can barely lift it.

208
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,428
- I'll do it for you instead.
- No way.

209
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,899
I'm doing Haruka's makeup.

210
00:13:32,978 --> 00:13:37,316
<i>The fashion show</i>
<i>of the Fashion and Beauty Department</i>

211
00:13:37,383 --> 00:13:38,617
<i>will begin shortly.</i>

212
00:13:40,186 --> 00:13:42,188
<i>Number one, Kaho Fujimiya.</i>

213
00:13:42,254 --> 00:13:43,389
<i>Phantom Siita.</i>

214
00:13:52,531 --> 00:13:54,600
<i>Number two, Fuka Miyajima.</i>

215
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,501
<i>Dinosaur.</i>

216
00:13:58,204 --> 00:13:59,839
There's apparently one promising kid.

217
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:01,473
You mean Kamiyama from Year Two?

218
00:14:01,540 --> 00:14:02,808
I already know.

219
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,243
I've heard of them.

220
00:14:12,785 --> 00:14:14,820
<i>Number five, Satoru Kurata.</i>

221
00:14:14,887 --> 00:14:16,488
<i>A Rose from a Certain View.</i>

222
00:14:35,207 --> 00:14:37,476
<i>Number six, Hikaru Kamiyama.</i>

223
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:38,577
<i>Emergence.</i>

224
00:16:23,248 --> 00:16:24,950
That's so cool!

225
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,912
I was so nervous!

226
00:16:53,979 --> 00:16:55,114
You were amazing!

227
00:16:55,180 --> 00:16:57,649
It was all because of your amazing makeup!

228
00:16:57,716 --> 00:16:58,917
Yay!

229
00:16:58,984 --> 00:16:59,852
Hikaru!

230
00:16:59,918 --> 00:17:00,853
Good job.

231
00:17:00,919 --> 00:17:02,955
- Good job.
- Thank you.

232
00:17:05,691 --> 00:17:06,692
Okay, okay.

233
00:17:07,292 --> 00:17:08,227
Thanks.

234
00:17:10,129 --> 00:17:12,498
- Ow, ow!
- Oh, that's right. I'm sorry!

235
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:16,035
<i>You were hurt?</i>

236
00:17:16,101 --> 00:17:17,836
It's not a big deal.

237
00:17:17,903 --> 00:17:20,339
Even though it hurt so much to touch it?

238
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:21,240
Shut up.

239
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:25,444
Should you be drinking so much?

240
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:27,679
Stop worrying about me.

241
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:30,616
Shu, let's take a picture.

242
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:32,651
Sure. I'll be right back.

243
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,088
Haruka.

244
00:17:36,789 --> 00:17:38,624
Thank you for doing this.

245
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,094
Well, thank you for inviting me.

246
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,730
You were so cool,
doing my makeup at the end.

247
00:17:45,964 --> 00:17:49,034
That was inspired by the dark colors
from your failed makeup attempt.

248
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:52,771
<i>I thought the dark colors</i>
<i>actually suited you well.</i>

249
00:17:53,372 --> 00:17:55,274
So, it's all thanks to you, really.

250
00:17:56,442 --> 00:17:57,276
Thank you.

251
00:17:58,677 --> 00:18:01,313
You're gonna make me blush!

252
00:18:03,449 --> 00:18:05,217
Sorry! I mean.

253
00:18:05,784 --> 00:18:07,386
I got all sweaty earlier.

254
00:18:07,453 --> 00:18:08,754
So you should stay away.

255
00:18:15,394 --> 00:18:18,030
You didn't seem to care with Shu.

256
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,265
What was that?

257
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,935
It's nothing.

258
00:18:23,001 --> 00:18:24,369
I'll grab some food.

259
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,242
Good job, I got you drinks.

260
00:18:32,478 --> 00:18:33,378
Thanks.

261
00:18:34,046 --> 00:18:36,748
So you've got a crush on Haruka!

262
00:18:39,218 --> 00:18:40,119
How?

263
00:18:40,953 --> 00:18:43,956
People come to me
for relationship advice all the time.

264
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:45,791
You can't fool me.

265
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:52,364
You better not tell her anything.

266
00:18:52,431 --> 00:18:53,265
Got it?

267
00:18:53,332 --> 00:18:55,868
Why not? Haruka's single now.

268
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,402
We're just friends.

269
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:03,041
Keep that up, and some other guy
will take her away.

270
00:19:03,108 --> 00:19:04,343
What was good?

271
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:05,978
The chicken looks good.

272
00:19:06,778 --> 00:19:09,348
- Go for it.
- Maybe I'll try all of them.

273
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,487
It's Miorin!

274
00:19:15,554 --> 00:19:16,889
Hey, Haruka!

275
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:18,924
Wait, where's Hikaru?

276
00:19:18,991 --> 00:19:21,260
He had too much to drink.

277
00:19:21,326 --> 00:19:23,228
Shu helped him to another room.

278
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,032
I see.

279
00:19:30,102 --> 00:19:31,069
Hikaru?

280
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,993
<i>Maybe I don't know him very well at all.</i>

281
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,296
Could you root for my future with Hikaru?

282
00:19:57,362 --> 00:20:00,566
I learned something important
about myself that night.

283
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:02,267
You might regret it.

284
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:03,368
Don't go!

285
00:20:03,435 --> 00:20:04,903
