1
00:00:04,738 --> 00:00:07,073
<i>It wouldn't be good</i>
<i>if Kurotaki finds out I'm a guy, right?</i>

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,174
<i>Why is that?</i>

3
00:00:08,241 --> 00:00:13,179
<i>Who wants a guy pretending to be a girl</i>
<i>coming near the girl you're interested in.</i>

4
00:00:14,481 --> 00:00:15,315
Haruka?

5
00:00:17,717 --> 00:00:18,785
What's going on?

6
00:00:20,186 --> 00:00:21,054
Oh, crap.

7
00:00:25,025 --> 00:00:26,359
I slipped!

8
00:00:26,426 --> 00:00:28,695
You can put me down now, Hikaru.

9
00:00:31,464 --> 00:00:33,133
Be more careful.

10
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:35,535
You're strong for a girl!

11
00:00:37,270 --> 00:00:38,405
I did sports.

12
00:00:41,307 --> 00:00:42,409
Here.

13
00:00:43,443 --> 00:00:44,744
Thank you!

14
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,646
One second, Mr. Kurotaki!

15
00:00:51,885 --> 00:00:54,287
Have we met before?

16
00:00:58,024 --> 00:00:59,692
You remember me?

17
00:01:01,161 --> 00:01:01,995
Hikaru, right?

18
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:07,400
Haruka wasn't kidding.

19
00:01:10,103 --> 00:01:12,839
You really are handsome, Mr. Kurotaki.

20
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,142
Will you be friends with me, too?

21
00:01:23,049 --> 00:01:24,851
Are you testing me?

22
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:26,686
Excuse me?

23
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:27,587
I mean.

24
00:01:28,088 --> 00:01:29,689
Haruka's so innocent.

25
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:33,693
So I get why you'd worry
about what kind of guy I am.

26
00:01:35,261 --> 00:01:37,030
That's not what I was doing.

27
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,264
You're kind.

28
00:01:39,199 --> 00:01:40,133
I'm not--

29
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:41,101
Sorry!

30
00:01:41,167 --> 00:01:42,802
-I'm back.
-Good.

31
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:46,806
Hikaru must really care about you a lot.

32
00:01:47,373 --> 00:01:48,942
-Huh?
-You got it wrong!

33
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:51,044
What kind of friends are you?

34
00:01:52,178 --> 00:01:53,346
Good question.

35
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:55,982
We just met by chance,

36
00:01:56,049 --> 00:01:58,384
and Hikaru is like my mentor?

37
00:01:59,385 --> 00:02:00,320
What's that?

38
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,522
I don't know.

39
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:06,726
Anyway, Hikaru is like my favorite person!

40
00:02:09,429 --> 00:02:10,263
I see.

41
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:15,802
Hikaru?

42
00:02:15,869 --> 00:02:17,604
That's how it is.

43
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:20,673
You'd better not make her cry,

44
00:02:21,241 --> 00:02:22,442
Mr. Kurotaki.

45
00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:29,282
Got it.

46
00:02:32,352 --> 00:02:34,220
I'll get out of your hair.

47
00:02:34,921 --> 00:02:37,090
Thanks, I'll call you later!

48
00:02:42,061 --> 00:02:42,996
Friend, huh?

49
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,136
You two haven't done it yet?

50
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:51,738
Hikaru!

51
00:02:52,472 --> 00:02:56,042
You had dinner and went home?
Like in middle school?

52
00:02:56,109 --> 00:03:00,513
He's being nice and going slow
to match my pace.

53
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:02,248
You have put him on a pedestal.

54
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,017
Don't try to glorify him.

55
00:03:10,323 --> 00:03:11,758
Speak of the devil?

56
00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:14,794
Oh, no! Look, Hikaru!

57
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:17,030
<i>Wanna go camping with an overnight stay?</i>

58
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,766
<i>You can invite Hikaru, too! It'll be fun!</i>

59
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:21,234
What now?

60
00:03:36,849 --> 00:03:40,086
-Is this shiitake?
-I think they all are.

61
00:03:43,423 --> 00:03:44,290
Haruka!

62
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,361
Welcome!

63
00:03:48,428 --> 00:03:50,196
Not that I own the place.

64
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:51,431
Thanks for inviting us!

65
00:03:51,497 --> 00:03:53,466
-Thanks for coming.
-The air's so fresh!

66
00:03:53,533 --> 00:03:55,235
Yeah, isn't it great?

67
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,503
What is this lively gathering?

68
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,239
Oh, right!

69
00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:00,540
I already checked in.

70
00:04:00,607 --> 00:04:01,941
You can drop your bags.

71
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:03,276
Thank you!

72
00:04:06,379 --> 00:04:07,614
I'm bunking with her?

73
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:09,849
Is that a problem?

74
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,352
No. It's fine.

75
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,686
-Thanks.
-Sure.

76
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,457
That's it!

77
00:04:17,523 --> 00:04:18,324
So.

78
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,327
I have to say something about your outfit.

79
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:23,196
You planning on hiking?

80
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:28,501
I figured you had it covered
since you didn't come crying to me.

81
00:04:28,568 --> 00:04:31,037
You better respect the mountain,
or you'll die!

82
00:04:31,704 --> 00:04:33,606
We're staying in a bungalow!

83
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:38,144
Enough about me,
tell me about your love life!

84
00:04:38,211 --> 00:04:39,846
I bet you were popular.

85
00:04:39,912 --> 00:04:41,281
How many…

86
00:04:42,248 --> 00:04:43,149
boyfriends?

87
00:04:43,216 --> 00:04:44,050
Girlfriends?

88
00:04:46,819 --> 00:04:49,022
I'm not as experienced as you think.

89
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,625
I'm not wired for relationships.

90
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,830
Having to consider someone else's feelings
is too much of a pain.

91
00:04:58,564 --> 00:05:00,033
Being alone is easier.

92
00:05:03,002 --> 00:05:05,238
I have trouble adapting to others.

93
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:08,641
I imagine it's no fun dating me.

94
00:05:08,708 --> 00:05:10,076
That can't be true!

95
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:15,315
Because I have the most fun
being with you, Hikaru.

96
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:18,718
Ow!

97
00:05:19,385 --> 00:05:20,320
Ow!

98
00:05:20,386 --> 00:05:21,254
Are you okay?

99
00:05:23,456 --> 00:05:25,258
I keep telling you.

100
00:05:26,392 --> 00:05:28,928
Don't just say that to anybody.

101
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,963
I don't say it to just anybody.

102
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,098
Just you.

103
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:38,638
My life became much more fun
since meeting you.

104
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:44,377
-Wait?
-What?

105
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,980
Am I the only one who thinks that?

106
00:05:48,047 --> 00:05:49,315
Is it not fun for you?

107
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:53,019
I mean.

108
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:56,522
It's been pretty fun for me too.

109
00:05:56,589 --> 00:05:58,524
Right!

110
00:05:58,591 --> 00:06:00,293
Let's take a picture together.

111
00:06:01,761 --> 00:06:02,829
That hurt.

112
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:05,365
Okay!

113
00:06:05,431 --> 00:06:06,466
Say cheese!

114
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,167
Smile!

115
00:06:09,001 --> 00:06:09,836
Thanks.

116
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:12,705
I should post this.

117
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:16,743
This brings back memories!

118
00:06:16,809 --> 00:06:18,911
Look! I wrote this in high school.

119
00:06:18,978 --> 00:06:20,847
A bucket list?

120
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,816
Looks easy.

121
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:27,053
I couldn't get anything done on my own.

122
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,622
But I bet I could've done it with you.

123
00:06:31,991 --> 00:06:32,825
That's it.

124
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,262
I can get them done with you.

125
00:06:37,063 --> 00:06:38,030
Please!

126
00:06:38,631 --> 00:06:40,500
Will you help me do these?

127
00:06:43,469 --> 00:06:46,139
GET A BOYFRIEND

128
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:49,609
All of them?

129
00:06:53,646 --> 00:06:55,481
You want my help with all of them?

130
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,383
Yeah!

131
00:06:58,217 --> 00:06:59,085
<i>You ready?</i>

132
00:06:59,752 --> 00:07:02,155
Look at the time! I'll meet you out there!

133
00:07:02,221 --> 00:07:03,289
Wait.

134
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:04,824
You hold on to the key.

135
00:07:17,904 --> 00:07:19,872
Looks like I'm just a girlfriend.

136
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:25,178
Sorry I'm late.

137
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,880
You're Haruka, right?

138
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,115
Keisuke told me.

139
00:07:29,182 --> 00:07:30,082
Nice to meet you.

140
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,752
You can grab a drink from over there.

141
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:34,253
Thank you!

142
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,291
Keisuke, want something to drink?

143
00:07:38,357 --> 00:07:39,425
I was just thirsty.

144
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,127
-A canned <i>chuhai</i>?
-Yeah, thanks.

145
00:07:42,695 --> 00:07:44,897
-This?
-Yeah, leave it there, thanks.

146
00:07:46,032 --> 00:07:47,166
How do you cut this?

147
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:48,401
Is this too much?

148
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,302
Haruka.

149
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,805
Go lend him a hand.

150
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,541
I would, but…

151
00:07:59,912 --> 00:08:01,747
You're so helpless.

152
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,317
You need to be pressed to act.

153
00:08:05,284 --> 00:08:06,285
That's true!

154
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:10,423
Fine, I can join--

155
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,491
Okay!

156
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,327
I'll do this alone.

157
00:08:17,196 --> 00:08:19,632
I can't rely on you forever.

158
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:21,667
I'll go do my best!

159
00:08:22,635 --> 00:08:23,469
I mean.

160
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,505
Do your best at wh--

161
00:08:33,980 --> 00:08:35,715
I had about five.

162
00:08:35,781 --> 00:08:37,283
That's too much!

163
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,718
-That worked great!
-It did?

164
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:40,253
Awesome. Wanna try?

165
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,454
-I do!
-Go for it.

166
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:43,656
-Now, let it rest.
-Okay.

167
00:08:43,723 --> 00:08:46,659
I didn't expect you to like the outdoors.

168
00:08:46,726 --> 00:08:47,627
No?

169
00:08:47,693 --> 00:08:50,563
I thought it would be fun with you.

170
00:08:52,164 --> 00:08:52,999
There.

171
00:08:53,599 --> 00:08:55,568
Camping is fun when you go all out.

172
00:09:02,542 --> 00:09:05,144
I was happy you invited me today.

173
00:09:06,345 --> 00:09:07,747
It went as expected.

174
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:10,816
It's fun having you here.

175
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:17,957
-Um.
-Yeah?

176
00:09:20,726 --> 00:09:22,328
So what do you think,

177
00:09:23,329 --> 00:09:26,265
how do you think of me right now,
Mr. Kurotaki?

178
00:09:30,670 --> 00:09:32,505
It's so warm!

179
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,607
So hot, so hot.

180
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,775
Hot, hot, hot.

181
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:49,155
Just to check,

182
00:09:50,823 --> 00:09:54,760
can I assume you kind of like me?

183
00:09:56,462 --> 00:09:57,430
Yes!

184
00:10:05,071 --> 00:10:08,541
I was happy when you tried hard
and dressed up so much for me.

185
00:10:09,408 --> 00:10:10,543
I thought that was cute.

186
00:10:12,278 --> 00:10:15,748
Also, I think it's great
how diligent you are at work,

187
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:18,050
going the extra mile.

188
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:19,619
I admire that.

189
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:25,825
But

190
00:10:27,593 --> 00:10:29,061
right now,

191
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,538
I'm not looking to
jump into a relationship with you.

192
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:44,710
Not yet.

193
00:10:45,378 --> 00:10:46,379
Not yet?

194
00:10:48,047 --> 00:10:49,048
I mean.

195
00:10:49,882 --> 00:10:54,186
I get the feeling that you look at me
like I'm some prince.

196
00:10:55,788 --> 00:10:57,156
How did you know?

197
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:00,593
I have an ex

198
00:11:01,227 --> 00:11:04,263
who broke up with me
because I wasn't who she thought.

199
00:11:06,999 --> 00:11:08,668
You have put him on a pedestal.

200
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,569
Don't try to glorify him.

201
00:11:12,304 --> 00:11:15,608
In reality, I can be really childish.

202
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:18,911
And stupid, too.

203
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,649
Really, I'm just a regular guy
you find anywhere.

204
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,620
So, if we were to date,

205
00:11:28,187 --> 00:11:30,790
I want to wait
until we know each other better.

206
00:11:34,126 --> 00:11:36,862
I'm sorry for being so selfish about this.

207
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,031
You're not!

208
00:11:39,932 --> 00:11:43,669
I think I made a lot of assumptions, too.

209
00:11:46,205 --> 00:11:50,576
I'm happy you've really
put some thought into this.

210
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:58,117
I'm going to do my best
to help you get to know me!

211
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:05,091
Are you okay?
Don't you think you've had enough?

212
00:12:05,157 --> 00:12:06,992
I feel like drinking!

213
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:07,993
Hurry up.

214
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,929
Hikaru? What's wrong?

215
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,130
Shut up.

216
00:12:11,864 --> 00:12:14,233
You go have fun with Kurotaki!

217
00:12:16,268 --> 00:12:18,337
Whoa, watch out!

218
00:12:18,404 --> 00:12:19,839
Let's go back to our bungalow.

219
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:23,109
Sorry, Mr. Kurotaki, we're turning in now.

220
00:12:23,175 --> 00:12:24,677
-I can do that!
-Huh?

221
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,947
You're not touching me.

222
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:30,983
Good night! Be careful.

223
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:33,452
Be careful.

224
00:12:36,088 --> 00:12:38,657
Haruka, get me a makeup wipe.

225
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:42,261
You're dedicated to your beauty routine
even when you're drunk?

226
00:12:44,363 --> 00:12:45,698
Found it.

227
00:12:45,765 --> 00:12:46,599
Here.

228
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,969
Hey, Hikaru?

229
00:13:00,146 --> 00:13:01,013
Do it for me.

230
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:04,917
You're asking me to?

231
00:13:15,694 --> 00:13:16,896
What's so funny?

232
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:20,699
I'm the one who's always depending on you.

233
00:13:21,433 --> 00:13:24,003
So I'm happy I can return the favor.

234
00:13:26,405 --> 00:13:27,907
Why did you drink so much?

235
00:13:31,343 --> 00:13:33,078
Why?

236
00:13:37,683 --> 00:13:39,418
I was bothered.

237
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,123
Give me the wipe already.

238
00:13:49,595 --> 00:13:51,497
What did you two talk about?

239
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:54,300
You together now?

240
00:13:57,736 --> 00:13:59,772
If you're gonna date him…

241
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:11,483
See, that's what you get!
You need to put on more clothes.

242
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:13,919
You underestimated the mountain.

243
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,024
I'm taking a shower.

244
00:14:23,629 --> 00:14:24,697
You idiot!

245
00:14:35,507 --> 00:14:37,309
A bucket list?

246
00:14:37,376 --> 00:14:38,911
Will you help me do these?

247
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,748
You want my help with all of them?

248
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:57,963
Sorry, do you have a sister in Tokyo?

249
00:15:00,833 --> 00:15:01,800
You do, right?

250
00:15:04,970 --> 00:15:05,804
I don't.

251
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,506
For real?

252
00:15:08,140 --> 00:15:10,509
Then you look exactly like someone I know.

253
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,511
I thought you were twins.

254
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,048
-Really?
-That's crazy.

255
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:17,616
Bye.

256
00:15:20,052 --> 00:15:21,620
Hold up! Wait.

257
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:23,522
Can I get a pic?

258
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,557
-What?
-Haruka will be shocked!

259
00:15:26,358 --> 00:15:27,293
Back off.

260
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:28,961
Why take pics with a stranger?

261
00:15:29,028 --> 00:15:30,229
Fair enough.

262
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:32,164
I'm Keisuke Kurotaki.

263
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,299
I don't care.

264
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:34,400
My bad!

265
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:37,136
-What's your name?
-Let me guess.

266
00:15:39,305 --> 00:15:40,306
Do you ever struggle?

267
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:43,309
You think people will always
want to talk to you.

268
00:15:44,877 --> 00:15:48,147
Must be nice being so happy-go-lucky.

269
00:15:48,213 --> 00:15:49,148
Honestly.

270
00:15:52,284 --> 00:15:53,118
But…

271
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:56,889
I bet she likes that.

272
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:00,826
Sorry. Who are you talking about?

273
00:16:04,263 --> 00:16:05,297
You have a crush.

274
00:16:05,364 --> 00:16:06,799
Like hell I do!

275
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,504
Actually, yeah, I do.

276
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:14,940
I'm just venting.

277
00:16:15,007 --> 00:16:17,209
You did nothing wrong. Sorry.

278
00:16:19,645 --> 00:16:22,982
You're so positive and upbeat,

279
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:24,917
just a good guy.

280
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:29,121
How'd you know?

281
00:16:31,557 --> 00:16:34,059
Does everyone see me like that?

282
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,029
I'm actually a pretty big loser.

283
00:16:38,297 --> 00:16:39,598
-What?
-I mean.

284
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:45,404
There was a girl today
who thinks I'm this great guy.

285
00:16:46,271 --> 00:16:47,306
But I needed time.

286
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:49,608
What?

287
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:50,876
She's just a good kid.

288
00:16:52,711 --> 00:16:55,180
<i>I'm not confident I deserve her.</i>

289
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:58,150
As you said,

290
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:01,153
I can be really happy-go-lucky and thick.

291
00:17:05,057 --> 00:17:05,991
I'm scared

292
00:17:07,459 --> 00:17:09,461
that I might end up hurting her.

293
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,299
So I acted really indecisive.

294
00:17:16,435 --> 00:17:17,403
Sorry!

295
00:17:17,469 --> 00:17:20,205
I shouldn't have dumped all that on you.

296
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:26,412
I bet I can guess what your exes told you.

297
00:17:28,013 --> 00:17:29,948
"Why don't you understand me?"

298
00:17:30,015 --> 00:17:31,550
"Whatever then."

299
00:17:31,617 --> 00:17:33,652
"Think of my feelings."

300
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:36,855
Am I right?

301
00:17:39,725 --> 00:17:41,393
But you didn't mean any harm.

302
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,498
They're just as bad.

303
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:50,369
Relationships are between individuals.

304
00:17:50,436 --> 00:17:52,137
You need to communicate.

305
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:55,507
Asking to guess is arrogant.

306
00:17:59,878 --> 00:18:02,314
You use some harsh phrasing,

307
00:18:03,649 --> 00:18:04,750
but you're actually kind.

308
00:18:05,717 --> 00:18:06,552
What?

309
00:18:09,822 --> 00:18:10,856
Give me your number.

310
00:18:11,523 --> 00:18:12,424
Why?

311
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:14,927
For future advice.

312
00:18:14,993 --> 00:18:16,495
-No way.
-Why not?

313
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:19,131
-You really are happy-go-lucky.
-Come on!

314
00:18:24,169 --> 00:18:25,504
<i>Thanks for earlier!</i>

315
00:18:30,542 --> 00:18:31,810
<i>So, what's your name?</i>

316
00:18:34,713 --> 00:18:37,249
HIKARU

317
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:45,858
KOICHI

318
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:49,895
<i>Got it, Koichi!</i>

319
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,335
The hell am I doing?

320
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:08,180
Hikaru.

321
00:19:10,682 --> 00:19:12,084
I love you.

322
00:19:48,987 --> 00:19:51,757
<i>When I put this on,</i>
<i>it feels like you're with me.</i>

323
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,425
<i>You're going to wear this and kiss him?</i>

324
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,826
<i>I can't get caught.</i>

325
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:55,661
Cherish her.

326
00:19:55,727 --> 00:19:56,828
<i>I'll kill you if you hurt her.</i>

327
00:19:56,895 --> 00:19:58,997
I'm going to go tell Mr. Kurotaki
how I feel.

328
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:00,766
This is your last one, Princess.

329
00:20:00,832 --> 00:20:01,900
