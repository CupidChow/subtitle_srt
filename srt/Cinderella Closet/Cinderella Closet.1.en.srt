1
00:00:05,806 --> 00:00:07,140
CONGRATS ON GRADUATING

2
00:00:07,207 --> 00:00:08,375
I'll join a club.

3
00:00:10,744 --> 00:00:11,879
Grow out my hair.

4
00:00:12,379 --> 00:00:13,480
CONGRATULATIONS, HARUKA

5
00:00:13,547 --> 00:00:15,582
Make all kinds of friends.

6
00:00:16,984 --> 00:00:18,519
Work at a café.

7
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:19,586
Get stylish.

8
00:00:19,653 --> 00:00:21,255
COLLEGE TO-DO LIST

9
00:00:21,321 --> 00:00:23,790
Have a fulfilling campus life.

10
00:00:25,559 --> 00:00:27,327
Get a boyfriend.

11
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:30,030
And be in love!

12
00:00:30,797 --> 00:00:31,932
POST

13
00:00:35,102 --> 00:00:37,371
Haruka, let's go!

14
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:50,751
I can't believe we're graduating.

15
00:00:50,817 --> 00:00:53,120
-Yeah, I'm so sad.
-Right?

16
00:00:53,186 --> 00:00:54,221
GRADUATION CEREMONY

17
00:00:54,288 --> 00:00:56,323
Let me stay over
if I come visit you in Tokyo.

18
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,291
Okay!

19
00:00:57,858 --> 00:00:58,992
-I can't wait.
-Yeah.

20
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,893
Thank you.

21
00:01:00,861 --> 00:01:02,663
I'll be a city girl by then.

22
00:01:03,497 --> 00:01:04,698
Ready?

23
00:01:04,765 --> 00:01:06,266
Say cheese!

24
00:01:48,108 --> 00:01:49,443
What are you doing?

25
00:01:49,509 --> 00:01:50,444
ONE YEAR LATER

26
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:51,445
Are you okay?

27
00:01:51,511 --> 00:01:52,346
I'm sorry!

28
00:01:52,412 --> 00:01:54,247
-Are you hurt?
-No, I'm okay.

29
00:01:56,750 --> 00:01:57,985
I'm so sorry.

30
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,053
Don't worry about it at all.

31
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:04,324
Excuse me.

32
00:02:04,391 --> 00:02:05,192
Yes?

33
00:02:05,258 --> 00:02:06,560
Is Kurotaki here?

34
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:08,962
He's on break right now. I'll tell him.

35
00:02:09,029 --> 00:02:11,431
Could you throw this away for us?

36
00:02:11,498 --> 00:02:12,566
Sure!

37
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:16,003
Kurotaki sure has a lot of friends.

38
00:02:16,069 --> 00:02:17,904
I know, right!

39
00:02:18,405 --> 00:02:22,376
I always pictured myself drinking
these fancy drinks and studying.

40
00:02:22,943 --> 00:02:27,080
Getting drinks that are
over 500 yen a cup?

41
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:29,916
You could buy lunch with that.

42
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:31,451
Right?

43
00:02:31,518 --> 00:02:34,021
The beer keg's empty!

44
00:02:34,087 --> 00:02:35,589
-I'll get it!
-Thanks.

45
00:02:35,656 --> 00:02:36,623
-Excuse me!
-Coming!

46
00:02:40,060 --> 00:02:43,296
Reality is harsh.

47
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:45,632
Let me.

48
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:51,738
Mr. Kurotaki!

49
00:02:51,805 --> 00:02:53,373
These weigh 20 kilos.

50
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,875
Don't push yourself.

51
00:02:54,941 --> 00:02:57,377
Don't worry, I have muscles!

52
00:03:00,213 --> 00:03:03,050
What, am I that undependable?

53
00:03:03,650 --> 00:03:04,751
Not at all!

54
00:03:06,687 --> 00:03:08,021
You're so serious.

55
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:11,024
Coming through.

56
00:03:14,895 --> 00:03:18,832
That Kurotaki is always
nonchalantly chivalrous. How nice.

57
00:03:38,318 --> 00:03:39,720
I'm home.

58
00:04:00,774 --> 00:04:03,977
What a thoroughly depressing room.

59
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:26,299
I could fall right asleep.

60
00:04:27,134 --> 00:04:29,803
Hooray for no makeup.

61
00:04:36,376 --> 00:04:37,277
I overslept!

62
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:42,482
I bought lipstick.

63
00:04:42,549 --> 00:04:43,784
Isn't it cute?

64
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:46,486
I bought so much.

65
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:56,997
I think I was more feminine
back when I was just dreaming of Tokyo.

66
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:03,670
I'm so sorry!

67
00:05:13,013 --> 00:05:13,847
What?

68
00:05:15,048 --> 00:05:16,483
Something on my face?

69
00:05:17,117 --> 00:05:18,185
You're staring.

70
00:05:19,586 --> 00:05:20,921
I'm so sorry.

71
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:23,757
I just got flustered
because you're so pretty.

72
00:05:25,025 --> 00:05:26,159
Thanks.

73
00:05:30,697 --> 00:05:33,066
Pretty people are just different.

74
00:05:33,133 --> 00:05:35,969
I'd love to wear makeup,

75
00:05:36,036 --> 00:05:39,906
but I put it off because
I'm either broke or busy.

76
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,412
Did someone complain
about you not wearing makeup?

77
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:48,315
No, not really.

78
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,284
Then you're fine

79
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:53,053
the way you are.

80
00:05:57,657 --> 00:06:01,094
Being able to compete
with your natural assets is best.

81
00:06:01,895 --> 00:06:02,996
Let's do our best.

82
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:31,591
If I were that pretty,
it'd be worth the effort.

83
00:06:32,192 --> 00:06:33,193
What?

84
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:34,995
No, it's nothing.

85
00:06:44,037 --> 00:06:45,639
Is it that good?

86
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:47,874
Yes!

87
00:06:47,941 --> 00:06:49,576
Then I guess today's a no.

88
00:06:50,377 --> 00:06:51,278
Today?

89
00:06:52,979 --> 00:06:55,282
I thought we could go out
for drinks after work.

90
00:06:56,016 --> 00:06:56,983
Again?

91
00:06:57,817 --> 00:06:59,753
Sorry I have so much free time.

92
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:00,820
Free time?

93
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,691
Did you break up with your girlfriend?

94
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:05,625
Bingo.

95
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,361
So come out and comfort me.

96
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:12,732
It's your fault for never calling her
while she is studying abroad.

97
00:07:13,633 --> 00:07:16,169
How about just drinks, no food?

98
00:07:18,405 --> 00:07:20,941
Sorry, I'm still underage.

99
00:07:22,142 --> 00:07:23,443
You're still 19?

100
00:07:23,510 --> 00:07:24,544
When's your birthday?

101
00:07:24,611 --> 00:07:25,946
Next Tuesday.

102
00:07:26,579 --> 00:07:27,681
That's soon!

103
00:07:27,747 --> 00:07:29,149
Let's go drinking then.

104
00:07:33,153 --> 00:07:34,888
All right, I'm off!

105
00:07:38,591 --> 00:07:42,529
Did we just make plans?

106
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,301
What am I going to do?

107
00:07:51,671 --> 00:07:53,139
No way!

108
00:07:54,841 --> 00:07:55,875
So young.

109
00:07:57,010 --> 00:07:59,412
ON HARUKA'S BIRTHDAY

110
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:01,815
Oh, crap!

111
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,452
I didn't get anything ready
for my birthday!

112
00:08:05,518 --> 00:08:09,022
After Mr. Kurotaki invited me out.

113
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:11,024
I have to do something!

114
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,361
Do I get makeup?

115
00:08:15,829 --> 00:08:20,734
Foundation? Eye shadow? Lipstick?

116
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:26,272
Destiny?

117
00:08:27,674 --> 00:08:29,476
What makeup are you using?

118
00:08:29,542 --> 00:08:33,813
It's my birthday today,
and I don't know what to do!

119
00:08:33,880 --> 00:08:36,383
I just need some makeup
to get through today.

120
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,218
How do you get those long lashes?

121
00:08:38,284 --> 00:08:42,322
Or that radiant skin!
Or that wonderful scent!

122
00:08:47,494 --> 00:08:48,428
I'm sorry.

123
00:08:48,495 --> 00:08:52,365
Um, I didn't mean to invade your space,
I just panicked.

124
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:59,005
Which one should I buy?

125
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,712
Beauty serum?

126
00:09:05,779 --> 00:09:07,480
Fixer?

127
00:09:07,547 --> 00:09:09,115
What are these?

128
00:09:11,017 --> 00:09:12,485
These are for lashes.

129
00:09:12,552 --> 00:09:14,454
The brush is curved for comfort,

130
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,589
and the fibers are great for length.

131
00:09:16,656 --> 00:09:20,727
Make sure to buy eye makeup remover
as well though.

132
00:09:23,763 --> 00:09:24,597
Here.

133
00:09:25,198 --> 00:09:26,199
Also.

134
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,002
Maybe around here?

135
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:30,070
Um.

136
00:09:31,471 --> 00:09:32,906
Thank you!

137
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:40,346
Not that I think you'll get far
with something last-minute.

138
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:42,916
Copying someone won't always work out.

139
00:09:42,982 --> 00:09:43,883
This too.

140
00:09:43,950 --> 00:09:44,784
Got it.

141
00:09:44,851 --> 00:09:45,819
What is this?

142
00:09:49,989 --> 00:09:50,824
Huh?

143
00:09:51,391 --> 00:09:53,159
Haruka! What a coincidence!

144
00:09:53,226 --> 00:09:54,527
Mr. Kurotaki!

145
00:09:55,462 --> 00:09:56,763
What're you up to?

146
00:09:57,330 --> 00:09:58,431
Um!

147
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:02,435
"I wanted to look cute for you!"

148
00:10:03,303 --> 00:10:05,405
There's no way I could say that!

149
00:10:08,875 --> 00:10:10,276
You two hanging out?

150
00:10:12,112 --> 00:10:13,613
Sucks, I've got work now.

151
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,382
Have fun.

152
00:10:36,136 --> 00:10:37,036
Well,

153
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:40,406
looks like I don't need these anymore.

154
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:42,041
Huh?

155
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:44,511
I thought we made plans.

156
00:10:44,577 --> 00:10:46,412
I guess it was just me.

157
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:50,350
With that guy?

158
00:10:55,488 --> 00:10:58,191
I just got my hopes up.

159
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:03,429
I feel so stupid.

160
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,201
You're not stupid.

161
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:13,373
You wanted to look cute
for a guy you liked.

162
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,342
Every girl does that.

163
00:11:23,416 --> 00:11:24,517
A girl?

164
00:11:26,152 --> 00:11:28,922
Am I really a girl though?

165
00:11:34,394 --> 00:11:35,962
Want to join the Dance Club?

166
00:11:36,029 --> 00:11:37,230
How about it?

167
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:50,910
There had to be a time
when I should have tried.

168
00:11:54,047 --> 00:11:54,881
But

169
00:11:55,648 --> 00:11:56,916
I didn't.

170
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:01,621
Eventually,

171
00:12:01,688 --> 00:12:05,325
I came to believe I could never
catch up to everyone else.

172
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:10,230
I have no confidence.

173
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:24,744
Let's go.

174
00:12:33,753 --> 00:12:34,587
Morning.

175
00:12:34,654 --> 00:12:36,122
Hi, Hikaru! Morning!

176
00:12:36,189 --> 00:12:37,824
-Hi!
-Morning, Hikaru!

177
00:12:44,063 --> 00:12:44,998
Cute!

178
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,872
I'm studying hair and makeup here.

179
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,241
Come on, sit down.

180
00:12:56,376 --> 00:12:58,244
No, I couldn't possibly!

181
00:12:58,878 --> 00:13:01,447
After 20, being ugly is a choice!

182
00:13:05,618 --> 00:13:06,919
Don't get the wrong idea,

183
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:08,921
I'm not talking about your appearance.

184
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:13,159
A self-deprecating smile isn't cute.

185
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,595
Come on, sit down.

186
00:13:29,876 --> 00:13:31,244
I'll cast a spell on you.

187
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,255
An amazing one
that gives you so much confidence

188
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:45,058
you won't care about
outside opinions anymore.

189
00:13:59,305 --> 00:14:00,907
Sorry to keep you waiting!

190
00:14:00,973 --> 00:14:02,308
-Let's go.
-Okay.

191
00:14:02,375 --> 00:14:03,276
Let's go.

192
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:06,112
Let's drink tonight.

193
00:14:06,179 --> 00:14:07,180
I'm so tired.

194
00:14:07,246 --> 00:14:09,282
-Know a good place?
-Mr. Kurotaki!

195
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:23,396
Good job at work today.

196
00:14:24,697 --> 00:14:25,531
Haruka?

197
00:14:26,099 --> 00:14:26,933
Yes!

198
00:14:27,633 --> 00:14:29,602
What's up? You going to a wedding?

199
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:31,704
What?

200
00:14:31,771 --> 00:14:32,772
I mean,

201
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:35,475
I'm just really surprised.

202
00:14:36,843 --> 00:14:38,111
You're so dressed up.

203
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:43,683
You look cute.

204
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:48,221
Kurotaki, we got a reservation!

205
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:49,422
Be right there.

206
00:14:50,957 --> 00:14:51,791
Later.

207
00:14:57,397 --> 00:14:59,232
This is my magic spell.

208
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:02,602
How you use it is up to you.

209
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:13,379
Wait!

210
00:15:16,115 --> 00:15:17,016
I actually…

211
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,619
Truth is,

212
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,722
I was waiting for you!

213
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,490
Huh?

214
00:15:24,557 --> 00:15:26,626
I don't think you remember,

215
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:30,496
but today's my 20th birthday.

216
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,234
And you said we should get drinks then.

217
00:15:37,370 --> 00:15:40,039
Um…

218
00:15:41,073 --> 00:15:41,941
So

219
00:15:43,309 --> 00:15:46,245
I was really looking forward to it.

220
00:15:49,015 --> 00:15:50,450
Man, I suck.

221
00:15:51,317 --> 00:15:52,251
Not at all!

222
00:15:52,752 --> 00:15:54,854
I just thought you meant today.

223
00:15:54,921 --> 00:15:57,557
It's my fault for not double-checking.

224
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:58,458
Sorry!

225
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,493
It's my fault.

226
00:16:01,828 --> 00:16:02,829
I'm really sorry!

227
00:16:03,429 --> 00:16:04,630
We're going!

228
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:09,802
No, I'm sorry for interrupting you.

229
00:16:10,703 --> 00:16:12,071
Have a nice time.

230
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:13,573
Wait!

231
00:16:17,009 --> 00:16:17,844
Listen,

232
00:16:19,045 --> 00:16:21,547
please let me make this up to you
next time!

233
00:16:26,619 --> 00:16:27,453
How about

234
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:30,790
instead of drinks,

235
00:16:32,892 --> 00:16:33,860
we go on a date.

236
00:16:46,172 --> 00:16:47,073
Okay!

237
00:16:54,747 --> 00:16:57,483
I come from a family of cabbage farmers.

238
00:16:58,918 --> 00:16:59,952
That still

239
00:17:00,553 --> 00:17:01,787
doesn't explain this!

240
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,256
It's to thank you.

241
00:17:03,322 --> 00:17:04,457
And also,

242
00:17:08,261 --> 00:17:09,562
I have a favor to ask!

243
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,499
Could you please teach me your magic?

244
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:15,468
What?

245
00:17:17,837 --> 00:17:18,738
I feel like

246
00:17:19,939 --> 00:17:21,841
I'm ready to step forward.

247
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:27,113
I want to be more confident.

248
00:17:28,314 --> 00:17:29,715
And be able to be myself

249
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:32,685
in front of the person I like.

250
00:17:34,954 --> 00:17:38,057
I want to be able to like myself.

251
00:17:44,297 --> 00:17:45,364
Please!

252
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,140
Just so you know,

253
00:17:55,041 --> 00:17:58,644
I don't coddle people
who've never made the effort.

254
00:18:03,783 --> 00:18:05,651
Yay!

255
00:18:05,718 --> 00:18:07,486
Okay, okay.

256
00:18:07,553 --> 00:18:10,089
You're such a nice person, Hikaru.

257
00:18:10,990 --> 00:18:13,593
You really like clinging to people, huh?

258
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:17,797
A toast to fate and meeting you!

259
00:18:18,297 --> 00:18:19,165
Cheers.

260
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:27,506
Come on, please eat!

261
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:28,708
No, go ahead.

262
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:31,210
What, why? Let me treat you!

263
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:32,211
Please eat.

264
00:18:32,278 --> 00:18:33,112
Well, for one,

265
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:35,147
I don't eat fried foods.

266
00:18:35,214 --> 00:18:36,349
Why not?

267
00:18:36,415 --> 00:18:37,383
Please eat!

268
00:18:37,450 --> 00:18:38,618
I'll have the edamame.

269
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:40,786
Eat the fried chicken too!

270
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:58,204
My room is clean?

271
00:19:05,244 --> 00:19:06,812
When did I do this?

272
00:19:07,413 --> 00:19:08,481
Wow.

273
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:12,218
Obviously, it wasn't you, you drunk.

274
00:19:12,284 --> 00:19:13,185
Who are you?

275
00:19:20,493 --> 00:19:22,094
I'm the wizard you summoned.

276
00:19:25,564 --> 00:19:27,400
You're the one who asked me.

277
00:19:30,703 --> 00:19:32,004
You're Hikaru?

278
00:19:33,105 --> 00:19:34,273
Yeah, that's me.

279
00:19:34,340 --> 00:19:35,241
So.

280
00:19:39,211 --> 00:19:40,980
Why don't you forget him

281
00:19:41,047 --> 00:19:42,114
and choose me.

282
00:19:45,284 --> 00:19:48,020
What?!

283
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,891
I wanted to become friends with you.

284
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:54,060
You're going on a date like that?

285
00:19:54,126 --> 00:19:56,195
I told him I came with someone special.

286
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,998
It wouldn't be good
if Kurotaki finds out I'm a guy.

287
00:19:59,065 --> 00:20:01,100
The truth is, I was lying to you.

288
00:20:01,167 --> 00:20:02,168
Thank you!

289
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,536
Just girls being friends?

290
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,904
