1
00:00:05,438 --> 00:00:06,973
<i>He got a phone call.</i>

2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:09,042
The Selesta Building? I'll be right there!

3
00:00:09,109 --> 00:00:11,644
Sorry, I promise to tell you later.

4
00:00:18,284 --> 00:00:19,185
Mio!

5
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,055
Keisuke.

6
00:00:24,224 --> 00:00:25,225
I'm sorry.

7
00:00:26,092 --> 00:00:26,926
I…

8
00:00:29,729 --> 00:00:30,797
Honestly.

9
00:00:32,132 --> 00:00:33,199
Where is he?

10
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:36,536
Haruka?

11
00:00:38,371 --> 00:00:41,875
I changed my mind. I don't want to go.

12
00:00:42,976 --> 00:00:44,778
You've come this far.

13
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:46,679
Don't you want some answers?

14
00:00:46,746 --> 00:00:47,747
I mean,

15
00:00:49,282 --> 00:00:51,751
I want him to think I'm a good girlfriend!

16
00:00:52,318 --> 00:00:53,219
Idiot.

17
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:57,524
You're in no position to try to act
like some understanding woman.

18
00:00:58,091 --> 00:01:00,193
You can't move forward without closure.

19
00:01:01,961 --> 00:01:02,896
Let's go!

20
00:01:15,775 --> 00:01:16,609
Thanks.

21
00:01:24,084 --> 00:01:26,486
I regret what happened.

22
00:01:27,487 --> 00:01:28,721
Back in high school.

23
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:30,156
What?

24
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:35,562
Hold on.

25
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:37,564
Crap, I left my phone.

26
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:40,266
- My bad, I'll be right back.
- Seriously?

27
00:01:41,301 --> 00:01:42,235
Woops.

28
00:01:45,738 --> 00:01:46,673
Huh?

29
00:01:49,976 --> 00:01:50,910
Ms. Suzuki?

30
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:54,614
- What?
- Huh?

31
00:01:55,849 --> 00:01:56,850
Kurotaki,

32
00:01:57,884 --> 00:01:59,319
you knew my name?

33
00:02:00,753 --> 00:02:01,988
Mio Suzuki, right?

34
00:02:02,589 --> 00:02:04,958
Of course, we're in the same class.
Why wouldn't I?

35
00:02:06,826 --> 00:02:09,863
But I guess this is
our first proper conversation.

36
00:02:10,830 --> 00:02:12,765
Kurotaki, what's the holdup?

37
00:02:12,832 --> 00:02:14,367
Sorry, go on ahead!

38
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:19,239
You're not coming?

39
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:24,811
I'm not like you and the others.

40
00:02:25,478 --> 00:02:26,779
You should come with us.

41
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:30,350
I mean, I want to talk more with you.

42
00:02:32,018 --> 00:02:35,755
<i>I thought you might be nice</i>
<i>when we first talked.</i>

43
00:02:35,822 --> 00:02:37,223
Please be my boyfriend.

44
00:02:38,725 --> 00:02:40,493
<i>I was happy when you asked me out.</i>

45
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:46,833
<i>I thought things were going well.</i>

46
00:02:51,037 --> 00:02:53,606
<i>But when I got back to school</i>
<i>after the summer holidays…</i>

47
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:03,550
DEAR KUROTAKI
I'M TRANSFERRING SCHOOLS

48
00:03:03,616 --> 00:03:06,052
THANKS FOR EVERYTHING
LET'S BREAK UP. MIO

49
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,265
I never understood why.

50
00:03:21,234 --> 00:03:22,969
But after seeing those videos…

51
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:27,774
I was ugly and gloomy.
But you were hot and popular.

52
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,876
I wasn't confident enough to date you.

53
00:03:29,943 --> 00:03:32,078
That's the real reason.

54
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:36,416
- You must be mad I used you for content.
- That's not it!

55
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:38,651
I'm angry at myself.

56
00:03:40,687 --> 00:03:44,791
I can't believe that I never realized
how much you were struggling.

57
00:03:48,494 --> 00:03:49,329
I'm sorry.

58
00:03:51,431 --> 00:03:56,569
I didn't think
you'd care about me like that.

59
00:03:58,471 --> 00:04:01,908
We should've talked like this
more often at that time.

60
00:04:10,617 --> 00:04:11,651
Let's look there.

61
00:04:14,787 --> 00:04:15,888
Where is he?

62
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:35,341
Hey!

63
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:37,777
I'm sorry!

64
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:38,878
Are you okay?

65
00:04:38,945 --> 00:04:39,779
I'm fine.

66
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:40,780
Thanks.

67
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,020
Haruka?

68
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:52,292
You had plans with Haruka today.

69
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:54,661
What is this?

70
00:04:57,163 --> 00:04:57,997
Sorry.

71
00:05:01,601 --> 00:05:02,969
A stalker?

72
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,371
I'm not sure yet.

73
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:08,675
But there was someone
who was following me all day.

74
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:10,410
And I got scared.

75
00:05:17,016 --> 00:05:18,318
I'll grab us some water.

76
00:05:19,218 --> 00:05:20,086
Thanks.

77
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,591
I'm sorry.

78
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:30,029
I just moved to Tokyo,

79
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,532
and Keisuke is the only one
I could turn to.

80
00:05:33,132 --> 00:05:36,469
It was low to ask him to come
when he has a girlfriend.

81
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,105
Please, I'm just glad you're okay.

82
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:42,542
Thank you.

83
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,680
I'm sorry for all this trouble
I caused you too, Keisuke.

84
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:50,183
Better to be safe than sorry.

85
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:52,185
You need to talk to someone.

86
00:05:54,587 --> 00:05:55,621
Sorry, Haruka.

87
00:05:55,688 --> 00:05:58,024
Is it okay if I walk her home?

88
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,627
- Of course.
- I can take her.

89
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,129
Huh?

90
00:06:05,698 --> 00:06:09,135
It's okay, Miorin would feel safer
with someone she knows.

91
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:10,470
Are you sure?

92
00:06:12,138 --> 00:06:13,473
Please be careful.

93
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:16,876
I promise to make it up to you.

94
00:06:17,577 --> 00:06:18,878
I'm really sorry.

95
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,715
Ready to go?

96
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,470
You sure that was okay?

97
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:49,142
Well, I'm sure she was feeling anxious.

98
00:06:50,777 --> 00:06:52,879
Being an influencer sounds tough.

99
00:07:01,287 --> 00:07:02,321
Thanks for today.

100
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:04,791
This is far enough.

101
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:06,259
See you later.

102
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,531
I'll walk you home.

103
00:07:12,999 --> 00:07:14,834
No, I'll be fine.

104
00:07:14,901 --> 00:07:15,835
You got it wrong.

105
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,304
I'm also hungry.

106
00:07:18,871 --> 00:07:19,705
Huh?

107
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,883
That looks so good.

108
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:32,118
Can I eat?

109
00:07:32,185 --> 00:07:33,653
Thanks for the food!

110
00:07:33,719 --> 00:07:35,188
Wait, I'll heat them up.

111
00:07:37,857 --> 00:07:39,592
You actually did a good job!

112
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:40,960
- Really?
- Yeah.

113
00:07:47,166 --> 00:07:49,735
- Right?
- They're like restaurant quality!

114
00:07:50,369 --> 00:07:51,938
That's going too far.

115
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:58,110
They were better right out of the fryer.

116
00:07:58,177 --> 00:08:01,180
You know they're good
when they're still good cold.

117
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,416
That's really good.

118
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:08,688
I've never seen
Mr. Kurotaki act like that before.

119
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:12,158
Sorry, I promise to tell you later.

120
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:23,336
That's no good.
I shouldn't be so insecure.

121
00:08:27,974 --> 00:08:30,843
It's okay.
You don't have to force a smile.

122
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:40,753
You know, I feel relieved.

123
00:08:42,221 --> 00:08:43,122
You're right.

124
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,393
You'll be there for me.

125
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,294
Yeah.

126
00:08:52,298 --> 00:08:53,132
So good!

127
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,135
Obviously. Who do you think taught you?

128
00:08:56,202 --> 00:08:57,270
It was you.

129
00:08:57,336 --> 00:08:59,805
That's right, so you better finish them.

130
00:08:59,872 --> 00:09:02,375
- Okay. You better eat, too.
- I will.

131
00:09:02,441 --> 00:09:05,211
Make sure to eat cabbage, too.
You need your vitamins.

132
00:09:14,353 --> 00:09:16,155
You're here early today.

133
00:09:16,856 --> 00:09:18,591
I'm really sorry about before.

134
00:09:18,658 --> 00:09:19,825
It's totally fine.

135
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:22,194
- But I made time for us in two weeks.
- What?

136
00:09:22,762 --> 00:09:24,897
It'll be our one-month anniversary.

137
00:09:25,998 --> 00:09:29,135
I thought girls might care
about that sort of thing.

138
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:31,871
You remembered?

139
00:09:31,938 --> 00:09:33,005
I'm so happy!

140
00:09:33,072 --> 00:09:35,708
We haven't been able to go out
because of work.

141
00:09:36,342 --> 00:09:38,444
So I'm going to put in some thought.

142
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,019
What is it?

143
00:09:48,721 --> 00:09:50,323
Sorry, it's nothing.

144
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,426
I'll call you later about it.

145
00:09:54,794 --> 00:09:56,062
I'll see you inside.

146
00:09:57,730 --> 00:09:58,564
Okay.

147
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,447
MAN ARRESTED FOR STALKING
POPULAR INFLUENCER MIORIN

148
00:10:14,513 --> 00:10:16,415
The stalker was arrested,

149
00:10:17,483 --> 00:10:18,851
so I got this for you.

150
00:10:20,987 --> 00:10:23,723
Thank you so much for the other day.

151
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:28,794
No, please, there's no need
to be so apologetic.

152
00:10:28,861 --> 00:10:32,131
I know this isn't enough,
but it's the least I can do.

153
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:36,168
Also, I won't contact him again,
so please rest assured.

154
00:10:36,736 --> 00:10:39,705
Did you bring us here just to say that?

155
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,641
I swear,

156
00:10:42,508 --> 00:10:44,944
I truly feel sorry about what I did.

157
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,279
But you're alone in Tokyo.

158
00:10:48,514 --> 00:10:50,349
Which is why you had to call me.

159
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:52,985
- But--
- Rely on us when you need help.

160
00:10:53,719 --> 00:10:55,187
Don't shoulder everything alone.

161
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,557
I feel the same way.

162
00:10:59,692 --> 00:11:00,660
Haruka.

163
00:11:03,963 --> 00:11:05,931
I'll get us more water.

164
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:07,733
For real?

165
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:09,001
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

166
00:11:11,437 --> 00:11:12,438
You idiot!

167
00:11:13,472 --> 00:11:16,008
Stop showing concern for me
in front of your girlfriend.

168
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:19,612
But you're my friend,
so of course I'm worried.

169
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,015
You haven't changed at all.

170
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:28,421
The way you're nice to everyone,
it makes your girlfriends insecure.

171
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:29,422
Really?

172
00:11:29,488 --> 00:11:33,025
Your idea of "normal" is a little off.

173
00:11:33,659 --> 00:11:34,593
Okay, fine.

174
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:36,495
I'll be careful.

175
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:40,232
Haruka is such a nice girl.

176
00:11:40,299 --> 00:11:43,202
I want someone like her to be happy.

177
00:11:44,603 --> 00:11:46,105
Take good care of her.

178
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,940
You don't have to tell me.

179
00:11:48,641 --> 00:11:49,542
Really?

180
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:52,945
I'll never hurt Haruka.

181
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:55,548
I promise.

182
00:11:55,614 --> 00:11:57,016
You better not.

183
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:12,798
<i>If only this was a world</i>

184
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:15,367
<i>where you can clearly measure love.</i>

185
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,812
I'm happy to hear from you Hikaru!
I thought you might be busy.

186
00:12:26,879 --> 00:12:28,180
I figured as much.

187
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,349
I'm free now since I'm on break.

188
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,450
<i>Thanks.</i>

189
00:12:31,517 --> 00:12:33,786
You've been dating for almost a month?

190
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,554
You remembered?

191
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:37,590
He's planning something for us.

192
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,126
That's nice.

193
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,895
Maybe an overnight date.

194
00:12:42,962 --> 00:12:43,796
What?

195
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,264
Overnight?

196
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,467
I guess you need to kiss first.

197
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:49,869
What?!

198
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:56,675
What are you picturing?

199
00:12:57,643 --> 00:12:58,477
What?

200
00:12:58,544 --> 00:13:00,880
It's your fault for bringing all that up!

201
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:04,984
Anyway, just go have fun.

202
00:13:07,419 --> 00:13:09,955
Sorry, I'll call you later.

203
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,394
<i>What?!</i>

204
00:13:16,061 --> 00:13:19,665
I didn't know this was the school
you went to!

205
00:13:19,732 --> 00:13:21,100
Why're you here?

206
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:23,803
I got asked to lecture
at the influencer course.

207
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:27,907
- And I'm going to judge this year's show!
- What?

208
00:13:29,508 --> 00:13:32,144
I think this is called destiny.

209
00:13:32,711 --> 00:13:33,712
How?

210
00:13:36,048 --> 00:13:37,149
Shu?

211
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:39,084
Haruka.

212
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:40,719
Hi.

213
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:43,589
- Coming home from school?
- Yes, on my way to work.

214
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,623
I see.

215
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,660
Hikaru told you about the show?

216
00:13:49,161 --> 00:13:50,362
It'll be like this.

217
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,233
BEAUTY INFLUENCER MIORIN

218
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:57,069
I like you!

219
00:13:57,636 --> 00:13:59,605
Wanna date me, Hikaru?

220
00:14:02,174 --> 00:14:03,075
Bring your boyfriend.

221
00:14:05,010 --> 00:14:06,979
I will. Good luck to you.

222
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:08,948
See you later.

223
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:29,735
MIORIN IS JUDGING HIKARU'S SCHOOL'S
FASHION SHOW. WANT TO GO TOGETHER?

224
00:14:34,273 --> 00:14:35,174
Hikaru.

225
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:40,279
<i>Have you decided what to wear</i>
<i>for your anniversary?</i>

226
00:14:41,113 --> 00:14:42,181
Welcome.

227
00:14:45,117 --> 00:14:47,686
Are you sure you're not too busy
to do this?

228
00:14:48,287 --> 00:14:50,522
How many times are you gonna ask?

229
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,558
It's helping me refresh my mind.

230
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:54,326
Thank you.

231
00:14:56,095 --> 00:14:58,097
What do you think about this dress?

232
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:01,567
Haruka?

233
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,139
Which do I choose?

234
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,075
You've been acting weird.

235
00:15:10,676 --> 00:15:12,678
Talk to me if something's on your mind.

236
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:18,284
Come on, it's okay.

237
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:25,024
Shu told me

238
00:15:25,691 --> 00:15:27,326
that Miorin will be a judge.

239
00:15:29,261 --> 00:15:30,095
Right?

240
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:32,965
I was surprised by that crazy coincidence.

241
00:15:35,267 --> 00:15:36,135
I see.

242
00:15:37,836 --> 00:15:39,738
Which is better?

243
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:43,108
You actually picked some nice ones.

244
00:15:45,144 --> 00:15:46,278
This one.

245
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:48,080
Then this one it is!

246
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:51,817
- Haruka?
- Yes?

247
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,519
Don't worry.

248
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,221
Kurotaki likes you.

249
00:15:57,489 --> 00:15:58,457
Thank you.

250
00:16:01,727 --> 00:16:02,628
Excuse me.

251
00:16:03,295 --> 00:16:05,464
- Could I get this?
- One moment, please.

252
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,837
I know this place from Instagram!

253
00:16:11,904 --> 00:16:14,907
It's stylish, delicious,
and really popular!

254
00:16:14,974 --> 00:16:17,176
I'm so glad you like it.

255
00:16:17,743 --> 00:16:20,212
You picked a great spot
any girl would like.

256
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,047
I go all out for my girlfriend!

257
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:26,852
What?

258
00:16:31,156 --> 00:16:35,928
I have to apologize for something.

259
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:37,830
Okay.

260
00:16:39,732 --> 00:16:40,899
The other day,

261
00:16:41,767 --> 00:16:46,405
I eavesdropped on your conversation
with Miorin at the cafe.

262
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:47,873
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:51,577
No, I'm sorry too.

264
00:16:52,111 --> 00:16:58,951
Mio really gave it to me,
telling me how much I should cherish you.

265
00:17:00,352 --> 00:17:02,921
Like she needs to tell me, you know?

266
00:17:09,695 --> 00:17:11,530
I thought you were a good pair.

267
00:17:13,165 --> 00:17:15,834
When you talk to Miorin,

268
00:17:16,368 --> 00:17:18,837
it's like you act more your age.

269
00:17:18,904 --> 00:17:19,772
I do?

270
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:25,811
I fell for your mature and cool side,

271
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:29,415
but you're actually really cute.

272
00:17:31,583 --> 00:17:34,219
Not a lot of guys like being called cute.

273
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:36,221
Is that true?

274
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:40,059
Um,

275
00:17:42,294 --> 00:17:46,698
what was it about me that you fell for?

276
00:17:47,366 --> 00:17:48,200
Well,

277
00:17:49,034 --> 00:17:51,003
you're diligent and cute,

278
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:54,239
and you're considerate and kind.

279
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,812
You're always a good girlfriend.

280
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:16,728
Isn't this…

281
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:20,899
I didn't know your ring size,
so I thought we'd buy it together.

282
00:18:21,667 --> 00:18:23,602
An anniversary ring.

283
00:18:30,609 --> 00:18:33,679
I thought we'd come up with
the girls before the boys.

284
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:35,881
Yeah, but…

285
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:38,117
The image I have…

286
00:18:41,753 --> 00:18:43,522
Huh? Isn't today their…

287
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:45,524
Be right back.

288
00:18:46,558 --> 00:18:47,926
Don't slack off!

289
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,069
Haruka!

290
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:00,439
Hikaru?

291
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,774
What's wrong?

292
00:19:03,575 --> 00:19:04,743
Don't you have class?

293
00:19:05,511 --> 00:19:06,879
And you? Where's Kurotaki?

294
00:19:09,581 --> 00:19:11,283
He went home already.

295
00:19:15,187 --> 00:19:17,689
Something happened, didn't it?

296
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:23,862
Haruka?

297
00:19:29,368 --> 00:19:30,235
You see…

298
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:36,175
The thing is,

299
00:19:37,476 --> 00:19:39,378
I broke up with him.

300
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:51,190
Please break up with me.

301
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:54,059
Even if you hate yourself,
I still like you.

302
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,930
Everyone gets a haircut after a breakup.

303
00:19:57,996 --> 00:20:00,199
Haruka, would you model
for Hikaru's group?

304
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:01,567
Leave it to me!

305
00:20:01,633 --> 00:20:03,502
You bring shame to the Kamiyama family!

306
00:20:03,569 --> 00:20:04,803
