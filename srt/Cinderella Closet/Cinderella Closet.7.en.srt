1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:06,106
I go all out for my girlfriend!

2
00:00:06,172 --> 00:00:08,308
This is what being a girlfriend is?

3
00:00:08,375 --> 00:00:09,409
Mr. Kurotaki.

4
00:00:09,476 --> 00:00:11,144
Your phone's ringing.

5
00:00:12,746 --> 00:00:13,613
Mio!

6
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:14,781
<i>A stalker?</i>

7
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:17,083
<i>Is it okay if I walk her home?</i>

8
00:00:17,150 --> 00:00:21,454
The way you're nice to everyone,
it makes your girlfriends insecure.

9
00:00:21,521 --> 00:00:22,889
Take good care of her.

10
00:00:22,956 --> 00:00:25,725
I made time for us in two weeks.
It'll be our one-month anniversary.

11
00:00:27,093 --> 00:00:28,294
Yeah, but…

12
00:00:28,862 --> 00:00:30,230
The image I have…

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,299
Huh?

14
00:00:35,502 --> 00:00:36,369
Haruka!

15
00:00:37,937 --> 00:00:39,706
Hikaru? What's wrong?

16
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:41,307
Don't you have class?

17
00:00:42,075 --> 00:00:43,343
And you? Where's Kurotaki?

18
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:47,580
He went home already.

19
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,853
Something happened, didn't it?

20
00:00:58,992 --> 00:00:59,926
Haruka?

21
00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:02,162
You see…

22
00:01:06,199 --> 00:01:10,937
The thing is, I broke up with him.

23
00:01:28,855 --> 00:01:31,891
You broke up?
Isn't it your one-month anniversary?

24
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,461
Yeah.

25
00:01:34,527 --> 00:01:35,462
What happened?

26
00:01:37,063 --> 00:01:40,934
I mean, all I can do is listen to you.

27
00:01:43,069 --> 00:01:43,903
Thanks.

28
00:01:47,774 --> 00:01:54,180
Um, what was it about me
that you fell for?

29
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:56,749
You're diligent and cute,

30
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,886
and you're considerate and kind.

31
00:02:01,221 --> 00:02:04,224
You're always a good girlfriend.

32
00:02:04,724 --> 00:02:09,028
I didn't know your ring size,
so I thought we'd buy it together.

33
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:11,564
An anniversary ring.

34
00:02:12,932 --> 00:02:15,168
So how does that lead to a breakup?

35
00:02:16,336 --> 00:02:19,572
He's done a lot for you.

36
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:21,908
That's why.

37
00:02:22,575 --> 00:02:23,443
What?

38
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,679
The truth is,

39
00:02:28,381 --> 00:02:31,217
I've been feeling insecure
since meeting Miorin.

40
00:02:31,284 --> 00:02:34,454
She's more like
someone I went to high school with.

41
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,890
Wait, there's nothing to hide.

42
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:39,359
She's my ex from freshman year.

43
00:02:39,425 --> 00:02:42,729
- What?
- Your ex-girlfriend?

44
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:44,964
Compared to Miorin,

45
00:02:46,299 --> 00:02:48,568
a cute and popular influencer,

46
00:02:49,669 --> 00:02:51,604
me and her are like night and day.

47
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,874
I became so insecure.

48
00:02:55,708 --> 00:02:58,378
Sorry, I promise to tell you later.

49
00:02:58,444 --> 00:02:59,812
Better to be safe than sorry.

50
00:03:00,613 --> 00:03:01,948
You need to talk to someone.

51
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:06,553
I thought to myself, he's never
looked that concerned for me.

52
00:03:08,288 --> 00:03:09,322
<i>With Miorin,</i>

53
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,725
<i>he acts more like a guy his age,</i>

54
00:03:13,293 --> 00:03:14,794
<i>and looks so happy.</i>

55
00:03:15,762 --> 00:03:19,265
I mean, it's because they go way back.

56
00:03:21,067 --> 00:03:22,001
No.

57
00:03:25,205 --> 00:03:26,539
Lately,

58
00:03:28,141 --> 00:03:29,209
I've felt jealous,

59
00:03:30,043 --> 00:03:31,511
and worthless,

60
00:03:33,746 --> 00:03:35,682
just really negative thoughts.

61
00:03:40,153 --> 00:03:44,791
Even when Miorin faced
the really scary threat of a stalker.

62
00:03:49,896 --> 00:03:50,897
If this went on,

63
00:03:52,699 --> 00:03:54,968
I would be growing to hate myself.

64
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:57,370
Ready?

65
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:04,477
Haruka?

66
00:04:10,450 --> 00:04:11,384
I'm sorry.

67
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,553
Can we talk?

68
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:23,763
Haruka?

69
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:27,634
What's wrong?

70
00:04:51,524 --> 00:04:54,060
Please break up with me.

71
00:04:55,361 --> 00:04:56,195
What?

72
00:04:59,098 --> 00:05:00,033
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:01,768 --> 00:05:02,835
Being with you

74
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:05,405
has become painful.

75
00:05:14,747 --> 00:05:15,581
I see.

76
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:18,384
Okay.

77
00:05:20,119 --> 00:05:21,187
I'm sorry, too.

78
00:05:24,524 --> 00:05:25,825
<i>That easily?</i>

79
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:27,860
Yes.

80
00:05:31,631 --> 00:05:34,367
I don't think he knows it himself,

81
00:05:35,935 --> 00:05:36,769
But

82
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,440
I think deep down, he likes Miorin.

83
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:42,642
Why do you think that?

84
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:45,411
Whenever he and I

85
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:48,614
say goodbye and part ways,

86
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:53,186
he never turns back to look at me.

87
00:05:55,455 --> 00:05:58,458
I'm like, is it just me
who doesn't want to say goodbye?

88
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,426
But

89
00:06:02,328 --> 00:06:04,564
someone who seems so unattached

90
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:09,869
kept worrying about Miorin
even after breaking up.

91
00:06:10,636 --> 00:06:12,939
No, I don't think that's--

92
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,874
Oh, please don't worry,

93
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,744
I'm the one who suggested we break up.

94
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,584
In the end,

95
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,086
I feel like

96
00:06:28,621 --> 00:06:31,357
I only longed for the idea of romance.

97
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,326
Huh?

98
00:06:34,127 --> 00:06:37,530
Like I only wanted to see
all the fun parts.

99
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:41,601
I was just too casual.

100
00:06:42,902 --> 00:06:44,070
Why would you say that?

101
00:06:45,805 --> 00:06:46,639
I'll get mad.

102
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:53,646
But…

103
00:06:55,848 --> 00:06:59,285
if I really liked him,
I should have tried harder!

104
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:04,590
Even after you supported me so much,

105
00:07:06,025 --> 00:07:09,862
how could I just let him go so quickly?

106
00:07:16,369 --> 00:07:17,303
I've seen you.

107
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:21,174
I know that you actually like him.

108
00:07:25,411 --> 00:07:26,379
I could see that.

109
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:31,184
Hikaru.

110
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,688
You're too easy on me.

111
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:40,993
That's fine.

112
00:07:43,629 --> 00:07:45,331
Even if you hate yourself,

113
00:07:47,266 --> 00:07:48,668
I still like you.

114
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:51,337
So it's fine.

115
00:07:59,712 --> 00:08:00,646
I was…

116
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:04,116
trying so hard to stay cool.

117
00:09:03,009 --> 00:09:03,910
<i>Hikaru ended up</i>

118
00:09:04,443 --> 00:09:08,247
<i>staying by my side until morning.</i>

119
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,197
The bangs could be a tad shorter.

120
00:09:27,033 --> 00:09:28,834
Yeah, you're right.

121
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,637
Then what about her?

122
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:34,106
Wrong eyes.

123
00:09:36,576 --> 00:09:39,045
Then what about this one?

124
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:42,848
This is the right direction,

125
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:44,750
but it's still--

126
00:09:44,817 --> 00:09:47,019
You haven't found a model yet?

127
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:49,155
Will you make it in time?

128
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,489
It'll be fine.

129
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:52,959
I'll find us the right one.

130
00:09:54,293 --> 00:09:55,261
As expected.

131
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,697
Anything for Hikaru, huh?

132
00:09:58,864 --> 00:10:01,934
I'm the only one who understands
his worldview.

133
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:04,170
It's been a big help.

134
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,171
Thanks.

135
00:10:05,237 --> 00:10:06,906
You're welcome.

136
00:10:07,573 --> 00:10:09,175
I'll do anything you need.

137
00:10:10,009 --> 00:10:12,411
So let's just give it
one last push together.

138
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:13,312
Right.

139
00:10:18,684 --> 00:10:19,719
Okay.

140
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,872
<i>I actually was waiting for you!</i>

141
00:10:39,939 --> 00:10:43,209
<i>To be honest, this is the first date</i>
<i>I've ever been on in my life.</i>

142
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:47,480
<i>I'm happy you've really</i>
<i>put some thought into this.</i>

143
00:10:47,546 --> 00:10:50,983
<i>I'm going to do my best</i>
<i>to help you get to know me!</i>

144
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:24,750
Hello?

145
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,654
You okay?

146
00:11:31,257 --> 00:11:33,759
Speak up and tell me what's wrong.

147
00:11:35,227 --> 00:11:38,564
<i>Hikaru!</i>

148
00:11:45,037 --> 00:11:49,575
You know how everyone
gets a haircut after heartbreak?

149
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:51,811
That's so cliche.

150
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:53,813
Look at this choppy cut.

151
00:11:53,879 --> 00:11:55,247
Is it that obvious?

152
00:11:57,983 --> 00:11:59,385
Why did you cut it yourself?

153
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,021
You could've gotten help.

154
00:12:02,855 --> 00:12:03,856
Huh?

155
00:12:05,558 --> 00:12:07,226
I'll cut your hair.

156
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:39,191
Well, I'm sorry.

157
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,293
I know we still have work left.

158
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,361
I won't take long.

159
00:12:43,062 --> 00:12:45,297
I'm sorry, this is my fault.

160
00:12:45,364 --> 00:12:47,666
No, don't worry. It's lunch break anyway.

161
00:12:48,367 --> 00:12:49,769
I just came to watch Hikaru.

162
00:12:49,835 --> 00:12:51,504
- Hikaru's cutting hair!
- Put your arms in.

163
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:53,439
- Really?
- A haircut?

164
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:54,974
Seriously? I wanna watch!

165
00:12:56,408 --> 00:12:57,510
Sorry about them.

166
00:12:57,576 --> 00:13:00,713
Not at all. Looks like you're popular.

167
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,681
Everyone must think you're amazing.

168
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:05,851
Hikaru won our school competition
last year.

169
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,453
What? You did?

170
00:13:07,520 --> 00:13:08,354
Yeah.

171
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:10,890
And only a select few at the top

172
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:14,727
are allowed to work on hair and makeup
for the show.

173
00:13:15,728 --> 00:13:19,165
Meaning Hikaru was one of
the selected few.

174
00:13:19,932 --> 00:13:23,369
Wow! I always knew you were special.

175
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,171
Why do you sound so proud?

176
00:13:25,237 --> 00:13:27,907
Because I know you better than anyone.

177
00:13:27,973 --> 00:13:30,442
Whatever, just sit down
and stay out of my way.

178
00:13:30,509 --> 00:13:31,710
Okay, okay.

179
00:13:36,215 --> 00:13:38,117
- Here is your drink.
- Thank you.

180
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,319
Sorry for calling out of the blue.

181
00:13:40,386 --> 00:13:41,887
I mean, I was surprised.

182
00:13:42,888 --> 00:13:45,457
Anyway, is it true
that you and Haruka broke up?

183
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,430
Even after the advice you gave me,

184
00:13:53,299 --> 00:13:56,035
I did it again. I messed up.

185
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:57,970
There's no helping you.

186
00:13:58,571 --> 00:14:00,739
Nice girls like that are rare.

187
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:03,542
So,

188
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:08,681
I thought maybe I'm not the right guy.

189
00:14:09,882 --> 00:14:11,483
Okay, fine.

190
00:14:12,751 --> 00:14:13,853
Leave it to me!

191
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:16,755
- What?
- Let's hold a review meeting.

192
00:14:16,822 --> 00:14:19,158
So you can learn from this.

193
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,132
- Thank you. I'm counting on you.
- Good.

194
00:14:27,933 --> 00:14:31,937
First off, let's address
the areas where you're a little off.

195
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,606
Wait. We're doing it right now?

196
00:14:35,374 --> 00:14:37,610
Wow, he's chop-cutting it all.

197
00:14:37,676 --> 00:14:40,079
I would've cut my own finger by now.

198
00:14:42,248 --> 00:14:44,383
Sorry about all the commotion.

199
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,019
No, thank you for making time
when you're busy.

200
00:14:49,154 --> 00:14:50,155
All done.

201
00:14:56,328 --> 00:14:59,064
I'm so glad you cut my hair.

202
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,134
It feels like a new me.

203
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:05,471
Your neck is long,
so short hair looks good on you.

204
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:10,276
I expected nothing less.
He's quite observant.

205
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,178
You too, Shu.

206
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,815
Sorry to take time away
from your lunch break.

207
00:15:17,383 --> 00:15:19,118
Thank you, too, Shu.

208
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:30,396
Hikaru.

209
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:33,265
I found her.

210
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:34,867
- Huh?
- Our model!

211
00:15:34,934 --> 00:15:35,935
Model?

212
00:15:36,902 --> 00:15:39,438
Like, doesn't this look like Haruka?

213
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:40,873
What?

214
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:43,375
- No, Haruka's not--
- Hey, Haruka.

215
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:46,445
Would you model for our--
I mean, for Hikaru's group?

216
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,249
- What?!
- Our theme is "emergence."

217
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:54,586
The concept is having average girls
transform with clothes and makeup.

218
00:15:56,655 --> 00:15:57,656
Like this?

219
00:15:59,825 --> 00:16:02,294
Isn't it exactly our vision
with shorter hair?

220
00:16:14,006 --> 00:16:15,641
This is the venue.

221
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,644
Wow, it's like the real thing!

222
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:22,848
Wait. Hold on.

223
00:16:22,915 --> 00:16:25,484
The models would be walking here?

224
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:27,686
Yeah.

225
00:16:27,753 --> 00:16:29,855
No way, I can't do that!

226
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:31,690
There's no way I can do this!

227
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,660
Someone like me doesn't belong
on a stage like this.

228
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,562
- But Haruka--
- It's okay, Shu.

229
00:16:38,564 --> 00:16:39,531
I know.

230
00:16:40,532 --> 00:16:43,235
I won't force you
to do something you're uncomfortable with.

231
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:47,606
So the thing is,
it's not that I don't want to--

232
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:48,841
There you are, Hikaru.

233
00:16:48,907 --> 00:16:49,942
Got a sec?

234
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:51,477
Be right there.

235
00:16:53,178 --> 00:16:54,113
Sorry, I'll be back.

236
00:16:59,485 --> 00:17:02,488
I'm sorry I couldn't help.

237
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:09,261
Haruka, this show is incredibly important.

238
00:17:10,195 --> 00:17:11,030
What?

239
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:15,100
The results will affect
our prospective job offers.

240
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:21,407
That means Hikaru's future, right?

241
00:17:23,041 --> 00:17:25,677
The look Hikaru gave
when I showed him the sketch…

242
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:29,415
I'm sure he thought
you were perfect as well.

243
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:35,220
You sure seem to understand Hikaru.

244
00:17:35,287 --> 00:17:38,057
Well, we go way back.

245
00:17:38,991 --> 00:17:39,892
Me and him.

246
00:17:42,261 --> 00:17:43,429
You and him?

247
00:17:43,962 --> 00:17:45,064
Sorry for asking.

248
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,966
Also, don't worry about the show,
he's still got me.

249
00:17:49,835 --> 00:17:53,872
I'll do whatever it takes
to find Hikaru a great model.

250
00:17:55,307 --> 00:17:56,141
Bye then.

251
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:57,743
Take care.

252
00:18:22,401 --> 00:18:23,235
Hikaru.

253
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:24,703
Sorry, I just finished.

254
00:18:26,638 --> 00:18:27,773
I'll walk you out.

255
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:29,842
Okay.

256
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,249
- Thanks for the haircut.
- Sure.

257
00:18:38,283 --> 00:18:39,751
Well, take care.

258
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:41,920
Look,

259
00:18:43,122 --> 00:18:44,756
what do you think?

260
00:18:46,592 --> 00:18:49,394
Do you want me to model for you?

261
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:51,263
Well…

262
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:53,465
It's okay.

263
00:18:54,333 --> 00:18:57,102
I know I just said I couldn't,

264
00:18:57,703 --> 00:19:00,339
but if I said I would model for you,

265
00:19:00,906 --> 00:19:02,107
would you be happy?

266
00:19:04,276 --> 00:19:06,979
I mean, I…

267
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:21,627
Hikaru?

268
00:19:22,294 --> 00:19:23,428
You know them?

269
00:19:24,630 --> 00:19:25,464
Hikaru?

270
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,538
You're still dressing like this?

271
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:40,078
You bring shame to the Kamiyama family!

272
00:19:49,488 --> 00:19:51,723
I won't let anyone hurt him,
not even his family!

273
00:19:51,790 --> 00:19:53,625
I want you to model for me.

274
00:19:53,692 --> 00:19:54,626
I'll do my best!

275
00:19:54,693 --> 00:19:55,761
Where does it hurt?

276
00:19:55,827 --> 00:19:56,962
I'll do it for you instead.

277
00:19:57,029 --> 00:19:58,997
No way, I'm doing Haruka's makeup.

278
00:19:59,064 --> 00:20:01,300
A guy can't be pushy after getting dumped.

279
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,935
AN UNEXPECTED TWIST!

280
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,836
