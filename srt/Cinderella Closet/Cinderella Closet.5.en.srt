1
00:00:05,338 --> 00:00:07,273
Would you like to date me, Haruka?

2
00:00:16,950 --> 00:00:18,418
I'd love to!

3
00:00:32,332 --> 00:00:34,134
<i>Giving each other presents.</i>

4
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,502
I'll never forget this.

5
00:00:35,568 --> 00:00:38,805
<i>When I put this on,</i>
<i>it feels like you're with me.</i>

6
00:00:47,213 --> 00:00:48,448
The other day,

7
00:00:48,515 --> 00:00:51,384
I went to a place with awesome pancakes!

8
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:53,653
I want you to try them, too.

9
00:00:53,720 --> 00:00:55,288
I wonder what their secret is.

10
00:00:56,089 --> 00:00:56,990
Whipped cream?

11
00:00:57,657 --> 00:00:58,491
The batter?

12
00:00:58,992 --> 00:01:01,161
You're going to wear this and kiss him?

13
00:01:05,198 --> 00:01:06,066
Haruka.

14
00:01:07,801 --> 00:01:09,102
Close your eyes for me.

15
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:10,503
Huh?!

16
00:01:11,337 --> 00:01:12,172
Okay.

17
00:01:22,348 --> 00:01:23,216
Got it.

18
00:01:25,118 --> 00:01:26,486
Thank you.

19
00:01:26,553 --> 00:01:29,589
And thank you for walking me here.

20
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,424
Of course, you're my girlfriend.

21
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,994
- See you tomorrow.
- Yes.

22
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,529
See you tomorrow.

23
00:01:40,567 --> 00:01:42,902
This is what being a girlfriend is?

24
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,207
Mr. Kurotaki is so nice!

25
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:50,443
He's going slow to match my pace,
and he's so mature.

26
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:52,545
<i>But it's still overwhelming.</i>

27
00:01:52,612 --> 00:01:54,747
Maybe it's my lack of experience.

28
00:01:54,814 --> 00:01:58,251
Better than him jumping you
like an animal.

29
00:01:58,318 --> 00:02:00,186
Come on, Hikaru!

30
00:02:02,989 --> 00:02:05,225
I'm glad it's going well.

31
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:09,462
Are you free on the weekend?

32
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,366
There's this event I wanted
to check out with you.

33
00:02:14,434 --> 00:02:16,236
Sure, if Kurotaki's coming.

34
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:18,805
Yeah? Okay.

35
00:02:18,872 --> 00:02:20,473
I'll ask him.

36
00:02:20,540 --> 00:02:21,574
Call you later.

37
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:23,376
Sure. See you.

38
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:38,591
<i>Mr. Kurotaki said he can go!</i>

39
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,261
<i>I can't wait to hang out with you again!</i>

40
00:02:52,038 --> 00:02:53,339
That's all from me.

41
00:02:53,406 --> 00:02:55,608
Let's invite her onto the stage!

42
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:58,311
Please welcome
the beauty influencer Miorin!

43
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,747
Miorin!

44
00:03:02,982 --> 00:03:04,918
Hello, I'm Miorin!

45
00:03:05,852 --> 00:03:07,387
There are so many of you.

46
00:03:07,453 --> 00:03:10,423
Thank you all for coming!

47
00:03:11,758 --> 00:03:13,293
Mr. Kurotaki just got here.

48
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:14,561
He's asking where to go.

49
00:03:16,462 --> 00:03:18,698
You, girl in the orange cardigan.

50
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:20,567
Huh?

51
00:03:21,134 --> 00:03:23,236
- Me?
- Yes, come on up!

52
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:25,271
But…

53
00:03:28,341 --> 00:03:29,976
It's fine. Go for it.

54
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:40,787
- So, Ms. Hikaru--
- Don't call me Ms.

55
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:43,056
Why'd you invite me today?

56
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:48,595
I don't want to be alone
with a taken woman.

57
00:03:49,462 --> 00:03:51,097
You don't need to worry.

58
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:54,033
She'd have more fun doing this with you.

59
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:57,203
Unbelievable.

60
00:03:58,438 --> 00:03:59,772
Are you serious?

61
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,574
I'm no threat to you?

62
00:04:01,641 --> 00:04:02,642
That's not it.

63
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,445
I'm saying I trust you both.

64
00:04:07,847 --> 00:04:08,681
Trust?

65
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,222
- Ms. Hikaru.
- I told you not to call me Ms.

66
00:04:17,490 --> 00:04:19,259
I like Haruka.

67
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:22,095
Do <i>you </i>actually like her?

68
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:23,930
What?

69
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,174
Mr. Kurotaki!

70
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,844
- Sorry to keep you.
- Not at all.

71
00:04:39,178 --> 00:04:42,248
You look great today.

72
00:04:42,815 --> 00:04:44,384
They just did this for me.

73
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:47,353
Looks great!

74
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:48,621
Wait, really?

75
00:04:48,688 --> 00:04:49,756
- Thank you.
- Keisuke?

76
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,327
Mio?

77
00:04:56,696 --> 00:04:58,331
MIO SUZUKI

78
00:04:59,499 --> 00:05:01,768
You're friends with an influencer, too?

79
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:05,838
She's more like
someone I went to high school with.

80
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,208
Wait, there's nothing to hide.

81
00:05:10,877 --> 00:05:12,879
She's my ex from freshman year.

82
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:16,382
- What?
- Your ex-girlfriend?

83
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:19,786
Ex-girlfriend?

84
00:05:21,954 --> 00:05:22,789
Come in!

85
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:28,428
Long time no see, Keisuke!

86
00:05:28,494 --> 00:05:30,096
I was so surprised!

87
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:31,397
It has been a while.

88
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,932
You came to my event!

89
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:34,334
That makes me so happy.

90
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,435
Well, um…

91
00:05:36,135 --> 00:05:38,838
I'm just tagging along with my girlfriend
and her friend.

92
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:39,772
Your girlfriend?

93
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,542
Oh, but please don't worry about me!

94
00:05:42,608 --> 00:05:44,444
There's nothing lingering feelings.

95
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:46,446
I just wanted to apologize to him.

96
00:05:46,512 --> 00:05:47,313
Huh?

97
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:51,417
So, when we broke up,
I told you it was because I moved.

98
00:05:52,285 --> 00:05:54,020
That was a lie.

99
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,792
This was me in high school.

100
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:01,661
I was ugly and gloomy.

101
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:04,664
But you were handsome and popular.

102
00:06:05,832 --> 00:06:07,700
I wasn't confident enough to date you.

103
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:10,470
That's the real reason.

104
00:06:11,104 --> 00:06:14,240
So I started doing this because
I wanted to change.

105
00:06:14,774 --> 00:06:18,878
To give confidence
to girls who're similar to how I was.

106
00:06:21,781 --> 00:06:24,350
Thank you for giving me that push.

107
00:06:27,553 --> 00:06:29,122
I didn't do anything.

108
00:06:29,188 --> 00:06:32,692
Is what I've been saying in my videos!

109
00:06:32,759 --> 00:06:35,261
Sorry, I've been totally milking it!

110
00:06:35,828 --> 00:06:36,662
Did you know?

111
00:06:37,230 --> 00:06:39,866
No, I just started following her recently.

112
00:06:40,767 --> 00:06:43,569
Still, you're as impressive as ever.

113
00:06:43,636 --> 00:06:46,038
Dating such a beauty!

114
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:49,175
- What?
- Such beautiful skin.

115
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,877
I'm so jealous!

116
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:53,646
Not me.

117
00:06:54,313 --> 00:06:55,148
Her.

118
00:06:56,416 --> 00:06:57,717
I'm sorry.

119
00:06:57,784 --> 00:06:59,218
Oh no, I'm so sorry!

120
00:06:59,285 --> 00:07:00,720
That's so rude of me!

121
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:02,555
Plus, you came on stage with me!

122
00:07:02,622 --> 00:07:05,358
I really stuck my foot in my mouth.

123
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,093
Please, don't worry about it.

124
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:10,062
Hikaru is beautiful.
I get the misunderstanding.

125
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:14,167
I'm sorry for being rude
with my stupid assumption.

126
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,067
Gosh.

127
00:07:15,668 --> 00:07:19,005
Hikaru's got crazy makeup skills.
I'm always impressed.

128
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:22,909
What?

129
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:25,711
Keisuke!

130
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,314
You can't talk like that to a girl!

131
00:07:29,015 --> 00:07:29,882
I mean.

132
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:31,617
Sorry.

133
00:07:33,152 --> 00:07:35,321
He probably didn't mean it like that.

134
00:07:36,389 --> 00:07:38,558
I'm a guy. Pretty good makeup, right?

135
00:07:39,192 --> 00:07:41,227
Seriously? You're a guy?

136
00:07:42,061 --> 00:07:42,895
Wow!

137
00:07:42,962 --> 00:07:44,764
I couldn't tell at all!

138
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:47,266
Is Hikaru your real name?

139
00:07:47,333 --> 00:07:49,335
Are you in entertainment?

140
00:07:49,902 --> 00:07:51,270
No, I'm not.

141
00:07:51,337 --> 00:07:53,673
Wow, what a waste!

142
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:56,476
You dating anyone?

143
00:07:56,542 --> 00:07:58,478
Are you attracted to girls?

144
00:07:58,544 --> 00:08:00,480
- Excuse me?
- I like you!

145
00:08:00,546 --> 00:08:02,448
Wanna date me, Hikaru?

146
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:04,884
Say what now?

147
00:08:04,951 --> 00:08:08,387
I've been looking to start
a couples channel.

148
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:09,355
COUPLE CHANNEL
GIRL OR BOY?

149
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,590
<i>You got the stuff!</i>

150
00:08:10,656 --> 00:08:11,557
<i>A gem!</i>

151
00:08:12,158 --> 00:08:13,593
No way in hell.

152
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,528
It'd just be business?

153
00:08:15,595 --> 00:08:17,029
That's cold.

154
00:08:17,530 --> 00:08:19,031
Okay, without the business.

155
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:21,501
Would you want to date me? Or not?

156
00:08:21,567 --> 00:08:22,401
No.

157
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,003
I have a crush.

158
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:26,138
You have a crush on someone?

159
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,775
Please stay quiet
or you'll complicate things.

160
00:08:30,343 --> 00:08:31,844
In other words,

161
00:08:31,911 --> 00:08:33,880
you're not dating anyone yet.

162
00:08:33,946 --> 00:08:36,449
Which means I've got a chance!

163
00:08:36,515 --> 00:08:37,350
You don't.

164
00:08:38,651 --> 00:08:40,386
I don't know about other people,

165
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,723
but I only date people I really like.

166
00:08:45,057 --> 00:08:47,159
You're so monogamous!

167
00:08:47,226 --> 00:08:48,127
I decided.

168
00:08:48,194 --> 00:08:49,729
I'm playing the long game.

169
00:08:50,963 --> 00:08:52,498
You know, you've changed a lot.

170
00:08:53,432 --> 00:08:57,103
Of course I did.
I learned how to be pretty.

171
00:08:57,169 --> 00:08:58,437
I mean your personality.

172
00:08:58,504 --> 00:09:01,440
- But my appearance has changed more.
- Yeah, it has.

173
00:09:01,507 --> 00:09:03,009
But your personality, too.

174
00:09:03,075 --> 00:09:04,143
Really?

175
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,044
For sure.

176
00:09:08,714 --> 00:09:09,549
Okay.

177
00:09:10,583 --> 00:09:12,418
Well, see you later.

178
00:09:18,190 --> 00:09:19,158
Mr. Kurotaki!

179
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:21,827
Um.

180
00:09:23,429 --> 00:09:25,464
Are you free next weekend?

181
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:30,903
Do you want to come over to my place?

182
00:09:33,406 --> 00:09:35,174
<i>Oh gosh, I said it!</i>

183
00:09:35,241 --> 00:09:36,409
<i>What am I gonna do?</i>

184
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,779
<i>He's going to be so turned off</i>
<i>that I asked him.</i>

185
00:09:39,845 --> 00:09:40,746
Definitely!

186
00:09:43,616 --> 00:09:46,619
I have work until evening,
so could I come after?

187
00:09:47,553 --> 00:09:48,387
Yes!

188
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:50,156
Well, then.

189
00:09:50,756 --> 00:09:52,858
I'd like to have your home-cooking.

190
00:09:55,962 --> 00:09:57,930
A-Any requests?

191
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:58,898
Fried chicken!

192
00:10:01,467 --> 00:10:02,969
You got it!

193
00:10:09,809 --> 00:10:12,044
What the hell is this?

194
00:10:12,111 --> 00:10:13,012
Idiot.

195
00:10:13,579 --> 00:10:15,648
Mio got in your head.

196
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,452
You're dead wrong if you think
intimacy will solve things.

197
00:10:19,518 --> 00:10:21,854
And don't just give it away.

198
00:10:21,921 --> 00:10:23,889
You're absolutely right.

199
00:10:25,424 --> 00:10:27,994
You wanted to make a big gesture.

200
00:10:28,728 --> 00:10:31,430
Let's make sure he enjoys your food.

201
00:10:33,065 --> 00:10:33,966
Yeah!

202
00:10:34,667 --> 00:10:38,504
His problem is that
there's no ill will with him.

203
00:10:39,739 --> 00:10:43,509
Expecting a girl to cook
when she invites him over is so typical.

204
00:10:44,176 --> 00:10:46,112
It's not his fault.

205
00:10:46,712 --> 00:10:49,815
I should've been honest
and told him I can't cook.

206
00:10:50,883 --> 00:10:52,852
I just don't have confidence.

207
00:10:52,918 --> 00:10:57,690
Even if you wow him with food,
he'll just see you as his maid.

208
00:10:57,757 --> 00:10:58,758
Really?

209
00:10:59,525 --> 00:11:02,928
But knowing how to cook
will always be useful.

210
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,364
Got it? Then, get back to work!

211
00:11:05,431 --> 00:11:06,432
Yes, sir!

212
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,369
You think they're done? Or not yet?

213
00:11:11,237 --> 00:11:12,438
Hot!

214
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:15,841
The hell are you doing? What's wrong?

215
00:11:15,908 --> 00:11:18,477
You have to cool down
a burn right away or it'll blister!

216
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:25,685
Hikaru.

217
00:11:26,485 --> 00:11:27,853
Thank you for everything.

218
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:30,990
What's that for?

219
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:34,460
Just that you're the one
always helping me.

220
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:38,397
So, what's your crush like?

221
00:11:44,136 --> 00:11:44,970
I'm not telling.

222
00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:48,207
It's not happening, anyway.

223
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,810
I know I'll just trouble her.

224
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,814
I just want her to be happy.

225
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:02,855
What?

226
00:12:02,922 --> 00:12:04,156
You asked.

227
00:12:06,125 --> 00:12:07,126
I mean,

228
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:10,262
I'm a little envious of this person

229
00:12:10,863 --> 00:12:13,232
that you feel this way about them.

230
00:12:13,299 --> 00:12:16,068
I want to tell them
that you're my best friend!

231
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:18,204
Jealousy?

232
00:12:19,972 --> 00:12:21,607
Is this jealousy?

233
00:12:25,177 --> 00:12:26,512
Wait, it might be burning!

234
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:28,247
Oh, no!

235
00:12:28,848 --> 00:12:30,616
- Come look!
- Seriously?

236
00:12:36,689 --> 00:12:38,491
Yummy!

237
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,194
It tastes good when freshly fried.

238
00:12:42,261 --> 00:12:44,163
It's fun cooking together.

239
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:46,832
I couldn't do this on my own.

240
00:12:46,899 --> 00:12:48,367
That's fine.

241
00:12:48,934 --> 00:12:53,606
You don't date or marry someone
for their abilities.

242
00:12:54,206 --> 00:12:55,841
It's for their company.

243
00:12:57,276 --> 00:13:00,546
Then I'd want to marry someone like you.

244
00:13:01,614 --> 00:13:02,448
What?

245
00:13:02,515 --> 00:13:05,317
What kind of dress would you wear
for the wedding?

246
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:17,696
Cut it out.

247
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:19,031
I'm a man.

248
00:13:19,098 --> 00:13:20,766
I could also wear a tux.

249
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:23,068
Right.

250
00:13:24,036 --> 00:13:24,937
That makes sense.

251
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:27,473
I'm getting more tea.

252
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,210
<i>Huh?</i>

253
00:13:32,044 --> 00:13:32,978
<i>Why did I</i>

254
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:36,315
<i>have these kinds of thoughts?</i>

255
00:13:40,452 --> 00:13:41,420
THE DAY OF THE DATE

256
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:42,521
Hello?

257
00:13:42,588 --> 00:13:44,456
I'm done with work, so I'm heading over.

258
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:47,393
Great! Take your time on the way here.

259
00:14:04,577 --> 00:14:06,312
Perfect!

260
00:14:24,296 --> 00:14:26,198
How did it go with him?

261
00:14:27,066 --> 00:14:29,101
He invited me over to his place.

262
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:32,471
Did you have sex?

263
00:14:33,038 --> 00:14:33,873
Yes.

264
00:14:37,476 --> 00:14:38,477
Okay.

265
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:42,781
- Come in.
- Okay.

266
00:14:42,848 --> 00:14:44,016
Thanks for having me.

267
00:14:44,683 --> 00:14:45,951
I'm so tired from work.

268
00:14:46,018 --> 00:14:46,852
Fried chicken?

269
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,120
I'm so happy!

270
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:51,357
I wanted you to have them
fresh out the fryer.

271
00:14:51,423 --> 00:14:53,492
Can I borrow your shower then?

272
00:14:54,059 --> 00:14:55,694
- Huh?
- I got all sweaty.

273
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,966
Be my guest!

274
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:02,601
- This way?
- Over there!

275
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:05,905
- And towels?
- On the shelf! You'll see.

276
00:15:05,971 --> 00:15:06,805
Thanks.

277
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:10,175
- Enjoy!
- Thanks.

278
00:15:15,614 --> 00:15:18,951
My heart can't handle this.

279
00:15:37,069 --> 00:15:40,306
Mr. Kurotaki. Your phone's ringing.

280
00:15:41,307 --> 00:15:43,142
What? For real?

281
00:15:43,208 --> 00:15:44,143
Can you get it?

282
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,515
MIO SUZUKI

283
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,519
- Sorry. Thanks.
- Here.

284
00:16:01,427 --> 00:16:04,596
WAS THE FRIED CHICKEN PLAN A SUCCESS?

285
00:16:28,921 --> 00:16:30,622
<i>What's wrong, Hikaru?</i>

286
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,659
I just saw him. He's not with you?

287
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:38,630
He had to leave
because of some emergency.

288
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:40,232
<i>What?</i>

289
00:16:41,066 --> 00:16:43,068
Anyway, I'm fine.

290
00:16:43,135 --> 00:16:44,036
Thanks.

291
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:45,471
<i>But--</i>

292
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:09,595
Hikaru?

293
00:17:13,999 --> 00:17:14,833
Mio!

294
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:17,770
Keisuke.

295
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:20,839
I'm sorry.

296
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:22,608
I…

297
00:17:27,246 --> 00:17:28,213
What happened?

298
00:17:41,226 --> 00:17:43,896
He got a phone call.

299
00:17:45,097 --> 00:17:47,466
The Selesta Building? I'll be right there!

300
00:17:52,438 --> 00:17:54,440
Sorry, I promise to tell you later.

301
00:17:59,378 --> 00:18:01,246
What's he thinking?

302
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:04,083
He just leaves without a word?

303
00:18:04,149 --> 00:18:04,983
But,

304
00:18:05,818 --> 00:18:07,653
I'm sure something happened.

305
00:18:08,487 --> 00:18:11,156
So, it's nobody's fault.

306
00:18:21,166 --> 00:18:22,801
It's easy to hold it in.

307
00:18:24,036 --> 00:18:25,938
But it means you're running away.

308
00:18:28,207 --> 00:18:29,842
It's not healthy.

309
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:39,485
Let's go.

310
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,689
Don't worry, you have Hikaru with you.

311
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:00,873
Thanks.

312
00:19:21,793 --> 00:19:22,895
Let's look there.

313
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,099
Where is he?

314
00:19:49,421 --> 00:19:51,890
<i>I want him to think I'm a good girlfriend!</i>

315
00:19:51,957 --> 00:19:53,425
You don't have to force a smile.

316
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:55,961
I won't contact him again,
so please rest assured.

317
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:57,362
It'll be our one-month anniversary.

318
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,164
- Maybe an overnight date.
- Overnight?

319
00:19:59,898 --> 00:20:00,899
Be right back.

320
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:03,869
What was it about me that you fell for?

321
00:20:03,936 --> 00:20:04,836
