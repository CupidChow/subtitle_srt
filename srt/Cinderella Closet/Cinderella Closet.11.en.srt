1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:06,539
How long have you had feelings for me?

2
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:11,277
I probably liked you from the beginning.

3
00:00:31,765 --> 00:00:33,233
What? Mom?

4
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,534
Good, you're home.

5
00:00:34,601 --> 00:00:36,036
<i>- Mom?</i>
- Long time no see

6
00:00:36,102 --> 00:00:37,237
It's been a while.

7
00:00:37,303 --> 00:00:38,605
How've you been?

8
00:00:41,007 --> 00:00:42,809
So? You been working hard?

9
00:00:42,876 --> 00:00:44,577
Yeah, I have.

10
00:00:44,644 --> 00:00:45,879
Everything good?

11
00:00:45,945 --> 00:00:46,813
Why?

12
00:00:46,880 --> 00:00:48,882
I was meeting a friend in Tokyo,

13
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:51,584
so I thought I'd swing by
with some sweets.

14
00:00:52,185 --> 00:00:55,622
- Sure, but you could've called ahead!
- Sorry.

15
00:00:58,358 --> 00:00:59,225
Hello.

16
00:01:00,427 --> 00:01:01,394
Nice to meet you.

17
00:01:02,495 --> 00:01:03,630
Nice to meet you.

18
00:01:15,075 --> 00:01:16,676
So, Mom.

19
00:01:18,611 --> 00:01:20,246
<i>Wait, hold on.</i>

20
00:01:20,313 --> 00:01:22,816
<i>Do I introduce him as my boyfriend?</i>

21
00:01:23,349 --> 00:01:25,618
<i>But we just started dating.</i>

22
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:27,720
<i>This seems too soon!</i>

23
00:01:27,787 --> 00:01:28,621
Um,

24
00:01:29,322 --> 00:01:31,724
I have the privilege of dating Haruka.

25
00:01:32,358 --> 00:01:33,460
I'm Hikaru Kamiyama.

26
00:01:34,027 --> 00:01:35,028
Nice to meet you.

27
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:37,797
My.

28
00:01:38,631 --> 00:01:41,267
Someone like you is dating Haruka?

29
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:46,372
Wait, you look kind of familiar.

30
00:01:52,345 --> 00:01:53,213
This?

31
00:01:56,716 --> 00:01:58,184
It's not what you think!

32
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:01,721
I mean, it is.

33
00:02:05,358 --> 00:02:06,226
I'm sorry!

34
00:02:08,361 --> 00:02:09,762
Why are you apologizing?

35
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:13,666
I mean… You're not surprised?

36
00:02:13,733 --> 00:02:15,368
It's lovely!

37
00:02:15,935 --> 00:02:18,238
Boys these days wear makeup, right?

38
00:02:18,304 --> 00:02:20,740
They do, but this is…

39
00:02:20,807 --> 00:02:21,875
So cute!

40
00:02:25,745 --> 00:02:27,847
I have to hurry or I'll miss my bus!

41
00:02:27,914 --> 00:02:29,249
I have to go.

42
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:36,723
I'm so sad, I wanted to meet
the Hikaru from the picture too.

43
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:39,125
See you again.

44
00:02:39,626 --> 00:02:41,961
Hold on, I'll walk you to the bus stop.

45
00:02:42,028 --> 00:02:43,163
I'm fine!

46
00:02:43,229 --> 00:02:45,698
Could I just borrow the bathroom first?

47
00:02:45,765 --> 00:02:46,633
Sure.

48
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,507
- Hey, Haruka.
- Yeah?

49
00:02:54,574 --> 00:02:55,675
Got a sec?

50
00:02:56,876 --> 00:02:58,778
PLATFORM 3
TO TAKASAKI

51
00:02:58,845 --> 00:03:00,580
- Really?
- Yes, really.

52
00:03:00,647 --> 00:03:02,248
This is your only luggage?

53
00:03:09,255 --> 00:03:10,490
Thank you for waiting.

54
00:03:10,557 --> 00:03:15,862
Hikaru wanted to dress up like the picture
for you before you left.

55
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,397
You did that for me?

56
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:20,600
Sorry, I didn't have time to change.

57
00:03:20,667 --> 00:03:23,169
He went all the way home to do this.

58
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:24,237
Really?

59
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:25,705
I'm so happy!

60
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:28,508
Right, can you take a picture?

61
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:30,376
- Is that okay?
- Yes.

62
00:03:30,443 --> 00:03:31,244
Thanks.

63
00:03:31,311 --> 00:03:33,479
Ready? Say cheese!

64
00:03:35,715 --> 00:03:36,549
Nice.

65
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:37,617
Here.

66
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:41,721
So cute!

67
00:03:41,788 --> 00:03:43,690
I'm satisfied now.

68
00:03:43,756 --> 00:03:45,391
You're so over the top.

69
00:03:45,458 --> 00:03:46,626
I mean,

70
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:50,530
back when you first came to Tokyo,

71
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,432
you called me all the time,

72
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,567
and I was worried how lonely you seemed.

73
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:59,606
But lately, you sound so happy
and full of life on the phone.

74
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:02,542
It must be thanks to you.

75
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:04,611
Oh, no. It's nothing.

76
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:09,849
I thought she might fall for
some weird guy living alone in Tokyo.

77
00:04:12,518 --> 00:04:16,456
But with someone like you,
I can be at ease.

78
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:22,028
Please take care of Haruka for me.

79
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:23,129
Of course.

80
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:24,230
I'll do my best.

81
00:04:26,866 --> 00:04:30,103
You two should come over sometime!

82
00:04:31,371 --> 00:04:32,805
So everyone can meet him.

83
00:04:32,872 --> 00:04:34,807
Mom was so happy!

84
00:04:34,874 --> 00:04:36,542
Thank you, Hikaru!

85
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,212
Oh, sure. My pleasure.

86
00:04:50,456 --> 00:04:53,926
Sorry, I appreciate you humoring my mom.

87
00:04:53,993 --> 00:04:55,061
It's not that!

88
00:04:59,632 --> 00:05:00,833
Sorry.

89
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:03,336
I was in such a rush,

90
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:07,340
I only had time for makeup.
I didn't even get changed.

91
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:11,077
I feel really anxious
having my look so incomplete.

92
00:05:12,612 --> 00:05:14,580
I don't want you seeing me like this.

93
00:05:17,317 --> 00:05:18,985
That's so you!

94
00:05:19,052 --> 00:05:20,753
Your sense of fashion is so high!

95
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:21,654
Huh?

96
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:25,992
I guess really stylish people
never cut corners.

97
00:05:26,826 --> 00:05:29,295
That's not what I meant.

98
00:05:29,362 --> 00:05:32,932
By the way, you've been dressing
like a boy a lot lately.

99
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:36,903
I was hoping to see girl Hikaru, too.

100
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:40,740
That's okay?

101
00:05:41,307 --> 00:05:42,075
Huh?

102
00:05:46,879 --> 00:05:47,780
Well.

103
00:05:49,248 --> 00:05:52,585
I don't want to trouble you
since we're dating now.

104
00:05:53,252 --> 00:05:54,354
Trouble me?

105
00:05:55,988 --> 00:06:00,727
Being with such a genderfluid guy,

106
00:06:03,096 --> 00:06:03,996
you don't mind?

107
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:06,599
I mean,

108
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:14,607
I like any version of you,
whether you're a boy or a girl.

109
00:06:24,117 --> 00:06:24,951
Hikaru?

110
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:29,355
Your and your mom are just the same.

111
00:06:29,422 --> 00:06:31,724
Does it run in your family?

112
00:06:32,325 --> 00:06:33,593
Your genetics?

113
00:06:35,128 --> 00:06:37,230
Huh? What do you mean?

114
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:43,269
I wish I was born into your family.

115
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,209
That wouldn't be right.

116
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,981
We can't date if we're siblings.

117
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:17,236
I thought you were crying.

118
00:07:21,207 --> 00:07:23,409
I'm glad I met you.

119
00:07:48,067 --> 00:07:50,636
<i>Hikaru looked so happy</i>
<i>when he was smiling</i>

120
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:52,672
<i>that I forgot to tell him.</i>

121
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:56,676
<i>That I'm glad I met him, too.</i>

122
00:07:57,944 --> 00:08:01,547
<i>I thought these happy times</i>
<i>would last forever.</i>

123
00:08:02,114 --> 00:08:03,950
You haven't slept with Hikaru yet?

124
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:09,889
You've been dating a while now, right?

125
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,058
You don't need to tell me.

126
00:08:12,124 --> 00:08:13,159
Sorry.

127
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,927
Everyone has their own pace.

128
00:08:15,495 --> 00:08:16,329
That's not it.

129
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:21,167
Hikaru has been really busy
since becoming Tohko Miyoshi's assistant.

130
00:08:21,234 --> 00:08:23,503
Tohko Miyoshi, the hair and makeup artist?

131
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:25,371
So you do know her?

132
00:08:25,438 --> 00:08:28,741
Of course, she's the most famous one
in Japan!

133
00:08:29,342 --> 00:08:32,545
He's already become an assistant
before even graduating?

134
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:34,747
He's so impressive!

135
00:08:35,381 --> 00:08:38,651
And he still finds the time
to meet with me.

136
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:44,891
You were shooting all night, right?

137
00:08:45,491 --> 00:08:46,626
Are you sleeping?

138
00:08:47,193 --> 00:08:49,428
You go to school, then straight to work.

139
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:51,631
I'm worried about you.

140
00:08:53,032 --> 00:08:54,333
Aren't you happy?

141
00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,836
I came because I wanted to see you.

142
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,838
I'm hurt.

143
00:09:00,406 --> 00:09:02,375
Of course I'm happy.

144
00:09:03,342 --> 00:09:04,176
But

145
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:08,014
I'm sorry I'm too busy
to take you anywhere.

146
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:12,118
I freed up this weekend
if you want to come over.

147
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:14,220
Really?

148
00:09:21,193 --> 00:09:22,194
Hikaru?

149
00:09:22,261 --> 00:09:23,462
Hold on. Wait.

150
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:24,730
I can't.

151
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:25,865
It's your fault.

152
00:09:25,932 --> 00:09:27,767
Can we just stay like this?

153
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:29,735
Hikaru.

154
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:40,046
Hikaru?

155
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,151
Poor thing.

156
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:49,255
But it's only natural for the less busy
person to be accommodating.

157
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:51,991
I just have school and my part-time job.

158
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:57,330
Wait, that's all I have.

159
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,632
In that case…

160
00:10:04,337 --> 00:10:06,038
- Sorry, I know you're busy.
- It's fine.

161
00:10:06,806 --> 00:10:09,508
Here are the new product samples
I told you about.

162
00:10:10,309 --> 00:10:12,211
- Can you stay for one drink?
- Sure.

163
00:10:13,512 --> 00:10:14,714
Are you seeing Haruka?

164
00:10:15,915 --> 00:10:16,983
Thanks to her.

165
00:10:18,117 --> 00:10:21,120
She's adjusting her schedule for me,
so that helps.

166
00:10:21,187 --> 00:10:24,624
Too bad. I thought I had a chance
if you hadn't been seeing her.

167
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:28,661
I'm listening to you gush about her,
so let me have this.

168
00:10:30,196 --> 00:10:31,063
Sorry.

169
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:38,838
Sorry I'm late.

170
00:10:38,904 --> 00:10:40,306
Don't worry.

171
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:42,475
- Thanks for making time for me.
- Of course.

172
00:10:43,209 --> 00:10:44,844
I just need to work tonight.

173
00:10:45,478 --> 00:10:46,479
Let's go.

174
00:10:48,114 --> 00:10:49,548
What's your job today?

175
00:10:50,416 --> 00:10:51,684
A magazine article.

176
00:10:53,486 --> 00:10:55,888
I wish I could spend all day with you.

177
00:10:55,955 --> 00:10:58,624
I'm happy enough to get you until evening.

178
00:11:00,126 --> 00:11:01,060
You heal me.

179
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,299
I decided to learn from your example.

180
00:11:08,934 --> 00:11:11,604
I'm going to help Miorin out.

181
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:15,141
If you're working this hard, I should too!

182
00:11:17,977 --> 00:11:21,380
I don't think it's as easy
as you think it is.

183
00:11:23,249 --> 00:11:25,284
But I already decided to do it.

184
00:11:26,552 --> 00:11:27,420
Well.

185
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,057
If it's something you want to do,
I support you.

186
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:40,633
Sorry about that.

187
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:43,302
I tried to goad you on purpose.

188
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:44,236
You did?

189
00:11:45,137 --> 00:11:48,908
I mean, if you get busy too,

190
00:11:48,974 --> 00:11:51,110
we'll have less time to see each other.

191
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:56,248
You're being jealous, aren't you?

192
00:11:56,315 --> 00:11:59,085
- I am. Is that a bad thing?
- Not really.

193
00:12:03,355 --> 00:12:04,590
Is that the place?

194
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,326
Sorry, one sec.

195
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,065
Hello?

196
00:12:13,132 --> 00:12:13,999
Yes.

197
00:12:15,801 --> 00:12:17,169
Come to the office now?

198
00:12:20,372 --> 00:12:21,207
Okay.

199
00:12:22,475 --> 00:12:23,442
Understood.

200
00:12:27,313 --> 00:12:28,147
Sorry.

201
00:12:28,214 --> 00:12:30,950
Work? Don't worry about me and go.

202
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:33,953
I promise to go by your place tonight!

203
00:12:34,019 --> 00:12:34,920
I'm sorry!

204
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:39,024
- Give it your all!
- I will!

205
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:51,504
I'm finally finished!

206
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:54,473
Thanks for helping me edit.

207
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:58,978
I feel like you spent most of the time
teaching me how.

208
00:12:59,044 --> 00:13:01,313
I was like that starting out too.

209
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:04,083
But I love it, so it was worth the effort.

210
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,287
Something you love.

211
00:13:09,388 --> 00:13:11,857
Wanna celebrate finishing?

212
00:13:12,858 --> 00:13:14,693
I can go buy us snacks.

213
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:15,594
Thanks.

214
00:13:29,708 --> 00:13:30,743
Hello?

215
00:13:30,810 --> 00:13:32,044
Sorry about earlier.

216
00:13:32,778 --> 00:13:34,980
It's okay, I went to help Miorin.

217
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:36,549
<i>I see.</i>

218
00:13:38,150 --> 00:13:40,252
<i>But you seem down.</i>

219
00:13:41,754 --> 00:13:42,721
Did something happen?

220
00:13:43,756 --> 00:13:44,690
<i>No.</i>

221
00:13:46,792 --> 00:13:50,930
It's amazing that both you and Miorin
found something you love.

222
00:13:52,498 --> 00:13:54,800
I was just thinking that I have nothing.

223
00:13:57,536 --> 00:13:58,537
Sorry!

224
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:01,807
Wait, are you by yourself?

225
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:02,942
Wanna drink with us?

226
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:06,011
- Sorry, he's drunk…
- My treat.

227
00:14:06,645 --> 00:14:07,646
Cut it out.

228
00:14:10,449 --> 00:14:11,617
Mr. Kurotaki?

229
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:14,954
Oh, you have a boyfriend.

230
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,360
Sorry! You there, Hikaru?

231
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:23,929
Why are you with Kurotaki?

232
00:14:30,736 --> 00:14:33,239
I just ran into her on my way home.

233
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:35,875
Talk about a coincidence!

234
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:39,211
<i>Okay, I get what happened.</i>

235
00:14:39,278 --> 00:14:41,413
Now that that's cleared up!

236
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,148
Let's get back to it.

237
00:14:43,215 --> 00:14:44,183
Cheers!

238
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,885
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

239
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:51,390
<i>Mio, don't overwork Haruka.</i>
<i>She has classes to attend to.</i>

240
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,192
You're working with Mio?

241
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:55,661
<i>Don't butt in.</i>

242
00:14:56,929 --> 00:14:59,098
She says she wants to do it.

243
00:14:59,164 --> 00:14:59,999
So support her.

244
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,467
<i>That's none of your business!</i>

245
00:15:01,533 --> 00:15:03,669
Hey, Hikaru!

246
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:08,474
Hikaru, only insecure men get jealous,
you hear me?

247
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:10,142
- <i>What?!</i>
- "You hear me?"

248
00:15:10,209 --> 00:15:12,044
Are you drunk, Miorin?

249
00:15:13,045 --> 00:15:16,248
Um, I'll go talk to him alone.

250
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:28,360
It really was a coincidence
running into Mr. Kurotaki.

251
00:15:28,427 --> 00:15:29,495
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

252
00:15:30,663 --> 00:15:33,165
You have nothing to worry about.

253
00:15:33,232 --> 00:15:35,701
<i>I swear, he did nothing wrong.</i>

254
00:15:37,469 --> 00:15:39,872
So? Is that all you wanted to say?

255
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,341
- No.
- You want to try harder, right?

256
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:45,878
Then should you be partying now?

257
00:15:48,247 --> 00:15:50,182
Why are you being so mean?

258
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:52,851
Oh, no, I didn't mean to--

259
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:53,919
Kamiyama?

260
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:55,521
Yes?

261
00:15:56,322 --> 00:15:59,792
Sorry, you're at work.
I'll talk to you later.

262
00:16:00,659 --> 00:16:02,361
Wait, Haruka?

263
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:11,470
<i>How did things come to this?</i>

264
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,679
Sorry about everything.

265
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,217
I was panicking
that I had nothing going on.

266
00:16:26,518 --> 00:16:30,356
But I'm sure Hikaru doesn't know
what to do either.

267
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:34,159
Having nothing going on? I get that.

268
00:16:36,795 --> 00:16:39,531
Also, what's with the distance?

269
00:16:40,099 --> 00:16:41,300
I'm sorry.

270
00:16:42,234 --> 00:16:45,838
I don't want to do anything
that might upset Hikaru.

271
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,607
You're still as earnest as ever.

272
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:55,914
Wouldn't a girl normally feel happy,
instead of inferior?

273
00:16:55,981 --> 00:16:57,883
If their boyfriend is so impressive.

274
00:16:59,184 --> 00:17:00,152
Well,

275
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:05,090
Hikaru's my lover but also my best friend.

276
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:08,994
I want to be equal.

277
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:11,497
So we can be together forever.

278
00:17:12,264 --> 00:17:13,766
Equal, huh?

279
00:17:17,336 --> 00:17:18,203
But

280
00:17:19,304 --> 00:17:22,374
it's rare for someone to know
what they want to do from the start.

281
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:29,748
And Mio and Hikaru are on another level
since they're successful at it.

282
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:31,050
Another level?

283
00:17:31,116 --> 00:17:32,084
Normally,

284
00:17:33,385 --> 00:17:35,854
you have to try a few things
to figure that out.

285
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:40,592
I'm on the "have nothing" side too.

286
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:43,896
So

287
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,166
I try different things.

288
00:17:47,733 --> 00:17:51,303
And I'm not limiting my job search
to Tokyo either.

289
00:17:52,004 --> 00:17:52,938
Really?

290
00:17:57,443 --> 00:17:58,811
How about the two of us

291
00:17:59,812 --> 00:18:02,381
expand our horizons and try our best?

292
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:08,053
- Yes!
- Nice.

293
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:09,888
Good answer.

294
00:18:14,426 --> 00:18:17,663
<i>Mr. Kurotaki is still so cool.</i>

295
00:18:18,430 --> 00:18:21,366
<i>He's still someone I admire,</i>
<i>just like before.</i>

296
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:23,769
<i>But…</i>

297
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:24,703
Wait.

298
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:27,506
I'm okay here.

299
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,409
What if guys mess with you again?

300
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,343
I'll walk you.

301
00:18:31,410 --> 00:18:33,645
No, I'll be fine.

302
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:35,814
<i>I don't feel the way I feel for Hikaru.</i>

303
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:40,586
<i>The one I want to be with forever</i>

304
00:18:41,186 --> 00:18:42,521
<i>is Hikaru.</i>

305
00:18:43,589 --> 00:18:46,425
Thank you so much for everything.

306
00:18:58,871 --> 00:18:59,905
Hey, it's me.

307
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:04,877
- <i>What? Why are you--</i>
- Do you remember what you said to me once?

308
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,147
- <i>What?</i>
- About Haruka.

309
00:19:08,947 --> 00:19:12,184
<i>"Cherish her.</i>
<i>I'll kill you if you hurt her."</i>

310
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:15,587
That's rich.

311
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:20,492
You better come get her.

312
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:23,228
Or else

313
00:19:25,731 --> 00:19:26,832
I'm taking her back.

314
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,575
Do you know why lovers give rings?

315
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:38,844
Just keep thinking only about me.

316
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:40,145
Well, good luck.

317
00:19:40,212 --> 00:19:42,247
If you're unhappy, I feel hurt as well.

318
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:45,884
There was an accident.

319
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,186
<i>Hikaru?</i>

320
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:48,120
<i>No.</i>
