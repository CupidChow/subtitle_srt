1
00:00:04,537 --> 00:00:05,805
Haruka.

2
00:00:05,872 --> 00:00:07,073
Haruka. Let's go out on a date.

3
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:11,344
<i>I can't let him find out.</i>

4
00:00:12,012 --> 00:00:14,347
<i>I can be with him forever</i>
<i>as long as we're friends.</i>

5
00:00:31,631 --> 00:00:35,702
So you're dressed like a boy today.

6
00:00:35,769 --> 00:00:36,603
Yeah.

7
00:00:37,404 --> 00:00:40,306
I wanted to show you.

8
00:00:45,111 --> 00:00:47,747
You want to know
whether it suits you or not?

9
00:00:48,648 --> 00:00:50,450
It looks really good on you.

10
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:51,284
Very cute.

11
00:00:51,351 --> 00:00:52,185
Cute?

12
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,854
You can really pull off anything.

13
00:00:55,455 --> 00:00:57,223
You're way cuter than me.

14
00:00:57,924 --> 00:00:59,826
Your outfit suits you, too.

15
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,261
Let's go.

16
00:01:03,129 --> 00:01:04,564
Thanks.

17
00:01:13,206 --> 00:01:14,441
Let's eat!

18
00:01:20,046 --> 00:01:21,481
Yummy!

19
00:01:21,548 --> 00:01:23,583
Food makes me so happy.

20
00:01:23,650 --> 00:01:24,684
Calm down.

21
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:29,389
But it was worth researching.

22
00:01:29,956 --> 00:01:31,958
You went through all that trouble?

23
00:01:32,025 --> 00:01:34,527
Thanks, sorry for leaving
everything to you.

24
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:35,895
Not at all.

25
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:40,733
Leave today to me, all you have to do
is be with me.

26
00:01:42,669 --> 00:01:43,503
Okay.

27
00:01:45,238 --> 00:01:48,108
<i>Hikaru seems different than usual.</i>

28
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:51,778
Excuse me, I brought your desserts.

29
00:01:53,279 --> 00:01:54,514
We didn't order this.

30
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:58,785
This is free for all our customers
who visit as a couple.

31
00:01:59,686 --> 00:02:01,688
- We're not--
- Thank you.

32
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:03,156
Hikaru?

33
00:02:04,224 --> 00:02:05,258
What's the harm?

34
00:02:05,925 --> 00:02:07,060
Being a couple.

35
00:02:10,363 --> 00:02:12,132
<i>Why did he say that?</i>

36
00:02:18,037 --> 00:02:20,340
This is where you wanted to go?

37
00:02:21,141 --> 00:02:23,943
Apparently, this is a date spot.

38
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:26,179
Date?

39
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,182
I'll buy us tickets.

40
00:02:30,984 --> 00:02:32,752
<i>If he says stuff like that,</i>

41
00:02:33,353 --> 00:02:36,222
<i>I'll think this is an actual date.</i>

42
00:02:36,956 --> 00:02:38,458
That's so cute.

43
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:40,426
There are so many.

44
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,095
Wow, that's amazing.

45
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,997
Look, there's a shark!

46
00:02:45,265 --> 00:02:47,634
It feels like we're in the ocean.

47
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,205
Is that Frederic behind us?

48
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:56,176
Can I shake your hand?

49
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,746
Thank you.

50
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:02,515
They're so pretty.

51
00:03:12,158 --> 00:03:13,426
<i>What do I do?</i>

52
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:15,929
<i>Hikaru looks like some man I don't know.</i>

53
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:19,699
<i>I've felt so comfortable around him.</i>

54
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,668
<i>But now I can't calm down.</i>

55
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,003
Ready to move on?

56
00:03:31,144 --> 00:03:32,378
Since it's dark in here.

57
00:03:33,846 --> 00:03:34,681
Wait.

58
00:03:35,481 --> 00:03:37,750
Sorry, I have to…

59
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:47,060
What am I going to do?

60
00:03:47,126 --> 00:03:50,530
Hikaru's going to figure out how I feel.

61
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,867
What the hell is this?

62
00:03:54,934 --> 00:03:57,971
<i>Don't worry. I don't date girls</i>
<i>who leave bras out.</i>

63
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:06,246
There's no way he'll see me as a woman
at this point.

64
00:04:13,653 --> 00:04:16,823
<i>Plus, he already has a crush on someone.</i>

65
00:04:16,889 --> 00:04:19,359
<i>I'm happy just to be friends.</i>

66
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:22,829
So cute!

67
00:04:22,895 --> 00:04:24,230
Yeah, they are.

68
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:26,699
What's this?

69
00:04:28,268 --> 00:04:31,437
That's cool.
They even list their personalities.

70
00:04:32,272 --> 00:04:33,172
What?

71
00:04:33,239 --> 00:04:35,174
CUTE AND STYLISH, HONEST
WOULD BE A GOOD WIFE

72
00:04:38,278 --> 00:04:40,213
OVAL FACE AND ALMOND EYES
VERY DEVOTED TO EBISU

73
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,750
EBISU (FEMALE)

74
00:04:43,816 --> 00:04:46,019
LIKE AN IDOL TO ALL THE MALES
BUT SHE PICKED ORION

75
00:04:52,625 --> 00:04:55,762
I guess penguins experience
rich love lives.

76
00:04:59,032 --> 00:05:00,867
They have ice cream over there.

77
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,570
<i>I want to get away from love</i>
<i>as much as possible!</i>

78
00:05:04,637 --> 00:05:07,573
You're not ready
for your next relationship?

79
00:05:08,107 --> 00:05:10,510
Huh? Where'd that come from?

80
00:05:10,576 --> 00:05:11,411
I mean,

81
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:15,181
look how proactive
the penguins' love lives are.

82
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,417
<i>Curse you, penguins!</i>

83
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,120
Is there nobody you're interested in now?

84
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,188
<i>There is.</i>

85
00:05:23,222 --> 00:05:24,757
I don't think so.

86
00:05:27,694 --> 00:05:28,628
I see.

87
00:05:29,195 --> 00:05:32,699
<i>What do I do?</i>
<i>It's the first time I've lied to Hikaru.</i>

88
00:05:32,765 --> 00:05:36,803
Then what would you do
if someone came up and told you

89
00:05:38,037 --> 00:05:39,672
that they liked you?

90
00:05:40,506 --> 00:05:41,507
Would you date them?

91
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,745
Of course not!

92
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:47,080
Come on!

93
00:05:47,146 --> 00:05:49,649
I'm coming fresh off a breakup.

94
00:05:49,716 --> 00:05:52,385
I'm not that easygoing.

95
00:05:52,452 --> 00:05:55,521
<i>Easygoing is the last thing</i>
<i>I want Hikaru to think of me.</i>

96
00:05:56,189 --> 00:06:01,694
Besides, I'm kind of over love right now.

97
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:07,533
I'm happy as long as
I have you as a friend.

98
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:12,305
I see.

99
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:14,941
Got it.

100
00:06:16,576 --> 00:06:19,345
Why don't you wait there
while I get us ice cream.

101
00:06:21,147 --> 00:06:21,981
Okay.

102
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:25,885
<i>I feel so guilty.</i>

103
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,054
<i>Lying to Hikaru.</i>

104
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:33,025
<i>But it will be awkward</i>
<i>if he finds out how I feel.</i>

105
00:06:34,527 --> 00:06:37,730
<i>And there's no way I'm going</i>
<i>to let that happen!</i>

106
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:38,664
Haruka.

107
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:40,900
Hey, Haruka!

108
00:06:42,668 --> 00:06:44,437
- What?
- It's going to drip.

109
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:47,640
Sorry.

110
00:06:47,707 --> 00:06:48,541
Jeez.

111
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,013
What was that for?

112
00:06:54,947 --> 00:06:56,149
It was dripping.

113
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:58,851
Why would you do that?

114
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:02,255
You suggested we should share it
cause it's expensive.

115
00:07:03,556 --> 00:07:05,825
<i>He'll find out if I act like this!</i>

116
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:09,095
Hikaru! You're being a tease!

117
00:07:09,662 --> 00:07:13,199
- Huh?
- I mean, you have a crush, right?

118
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:15,635
What if they saw you?

119
00:07:16,335 --> 00:07:20,473
Besides, some people might think
you're leading me on.

120
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:21,474
What?

121
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:24,944
Well, what about you?

122
00:07:25,011 --> 00:07:28,181
You're the one saying stuff to lead me on.

123
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,082
Casually saying you love me.

124
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,285
It's not casually!

125
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,386
I'm not so sure.

126
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,987
You probably don't remember.

127
00:07:35,054 --> 00:07:38,257
I only say it to the people I love.

128
00:07:43,162 --> 00:07:44,363
<i>Oh, no!</i>

129
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,799
<i>That sounded like a love confession!</i>

130
00:07:49,135 --> 00:07:50,803
By person I love I mean--

131
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:52,305
What makes you like someone?

132
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:53,639
Huh?

133
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:56,209
A person who's nice?

134
00:07:57,143 --> 00:07:58,244
Or handsome?

135
00:08:01,514 --> 00:08:03,583
Or would you like someone who's manly?

136
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:11,491
You only see what's in front of you.

137
00:08:18,231 --> 00:08:19,098
Sorry.

138
00:08:20,366 --> 00:08:21,501
I can't do this.

139
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:25,371
Let's call it a day.

140
00:08:25,938 --> 00:08:26,839
Be right back.

141
00:08:32,712 --> 00:08:34,380
<i>It's my fault.</i>

142
00:08:35,114 --> 00:08:38,985
<i>Because I'm hiding my feelings.</i>

143
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,052
I'm sorry!

144
00:08:55,101 --> 00:08:57,603
<i>Am I going to continue to lie to Hikaru?</i>

145
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:09,482
<i>See, you look so much better now.</i>

146
00:09:19,692 --> 00:09:21,027
That was pathetic.

147
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:26,732
Hikaru.

148
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,134
Haruka.

149
00:09:29,235 --> 00:09:30,403
Sorry about earlier.

150
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:32,371
Um.

151
00:09:34,907 --> 00:09:35,942
Listen, I…

152
00:09:48,588 --> 00:09:50,222
I love you.

153
00:09:53,926 --> 00:09:56,362
I'm sorry for springing this on you.

154
00:09:57,196 --> 00:09:59,532
I know you already have
a crush on someone.

155
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,001
This might be inconvenient.

156
00:10:03,135 --> 00:10:05,838
But this love

157
00:10:07,073 --> 00:10:09,442
isn't platonic love for a friend.

158
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:14,080
I don't care if I get rejected
and things get awkward.

159
00:10:15,247 --> 00:10:19,118
I didn't like the way I acted
when I tried to hide my feelings.

160
00:10:21,754 --> 00:10:25,324
I was scared you might judge me
after helping me so much

161
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,628
with my relationship with Mr. Kurotaki.

162
00:10:30,596 --> 00:10:32,798
You might not believe me,

163
00:10:34,934 --> 00:10:38,270
but I don't want to lie to you anymore.

164
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,009
I love you.

165
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:47,847
I'm in love with you.

166
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:02,862
Could you say something, please?

167
00:11:02,928 --> 00:11:04,030
I can't.

168
00:11:08,501 --> 00:11:11,504
- I figured, thank you for--
- No!

169
00:11:12,438 --> 00:11:13,539
That's not it.

170
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:18,010
I don't mean it like that.

171
00:11:21,013 --> 00:11:22,848
You just caught me by surprise.

172
00:11:23,716 --> 00:11:24,550
I can't.

173
00:11:25,151 --> 00:11:26,018
I can't take it.

174
00:11:27,453 --> 00:11:28,387
What do you mean?

175
00:11:30,956 --> 00:11:32,324
You really don't know?

176
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:41,067
Who do you think I arranged
this embarrassingly cliché date for?

177
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,139
I wanted to be the one to say it first.

178
00:11:49,308 --> 00:11:50,142
Huh?

179
00:11:51,077 --> 00:11:51,911
What?

180
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:55,047
Seriously?

181
00:11:56,782 --> 00:11:58,117
The one I love is Haruka.

182
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:05,558
Wait.

183
00:12:05,624 --> 00:12:08,227
Who loves who?

184
00:12:09,628 --> 00:12:11,597
I love Haruka.

185
00:12:16,168 --> 00:12:17,136
You, Hikaru,

186
00:12:18,437 --> 00:12:19,405
loves

187
00:12:20,773 --> 00:12:21,607
me?

188
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:27,613
You're lying!

189
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:28,714
What, why?

190
00:12:28,781 --> 00:12:30,382
You said you have a crush!

191
00:12:30,449 --> 00:12:32,785
Yeah, and that's you.

192
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,921
But why, you've seen all my bad sides.

193
00:12:37,123 --> 00:12:38,457
Well, that's true.

194
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:49,702
You know how I asked you
what makes you like someone?

195
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:53,305
Well, I don't know the reason why either.

196
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:58,210
I mean, you're stupid and messy.

197
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,413
But

198
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:04,583
I have fun being with you,

199
00:13:09,488 --> 00:13:11,457
and I want to be by your side
all the time.

200
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:15,795
That's

201
00:13:17,696 --> 00:13:19,431
the same for me.

202
00:13:39,518 --> 00:13:40,886
Now do you believe me?

203
00:13:43,055 --> 00:13:45,424
You really are a tease!

204
00:13:45,491 --> 00:13:46,325
What?

205
00:13:47,359 --> 00:13:48,894
Not as bad as you.

206
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:59,738
For real? You confessed first?

207
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,807
Look at you, taking the initiative!

208
00:14:01,874 --> 00:14:04,510
No, I just went with the flow.

209
00:14:05,110 --> 00:14:06,645
I'm so glad.

210
00:14:07,313 --> 00:14:09,748
Hikaru's feelings are finally paying off.

211
00:14:11,750 --> 00:14:14,186
Do you know how long Hikaru had a crush--

212
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:17,857
was in love with me?

213
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:21,560
Why don't you
save that question for Hikaru?

214
00:14:23,128 --> 00:14:26,498
So the crush Hikaru had was you all along.

215
00:14:29,235 --> 00:14:30,102
Wait.

216
00:14:33,372 --> 00:14:36,609
This could be the perfect timing.

217
00:14:36,675 --> 00:14:37,643
A gift.

218
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,612
Really? Yay! What is it?

219
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:40,846
Open it.

220
00:14:40,913 --> 00:14:41,780
Okay.

221
00:14:51,357 --> 00:14:54,293
Another freebie from my sponsor.

222
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:56,128
Really? But this is…

223
00:14:56,195 --> 00:15:00,065
Nothing wrong with the girl
making the first move.

224
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:08,274
Welcome.

225
00:15:08,340 --> 00:15:09,408
Thanks for having me.

226
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:13,045
It's actually clean.

227
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:15,981
It's not like I'm planning anything!

228
00:15:16,649 --> 00:15:17,683
Planning?

229
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:19,952
It's nothing.

230
00:15:21,287 --> 00:15:22,288
Man.

231
00:15:23,088 --> 00:15:26,825
You finally learned to clean up
before a guest comes.

232
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,628
You can just take it easy.

233
00:15:29,695 --> 00:15:30,529
Why?

234
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:32,731
It will go faster if I help.

235
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:39,872
You're going to get your sleeve wet.

236
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:41,740
So close.

237
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:45,844
Nothing.

238
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:48,714
Okay, let's eat!

239
00:15:50,015 --> 00:15:50,849
Looks good.

240
00:15:50,916 --> 00:15:52,885
My mom made this for me a lot.

241
00:15:53,419 --> 00:15:56,322
Making it with extra meat
is a treat at home.

242
00:15:58,657 --> 00:15:59,558
Yum.

243
00:16:02,828 --> 00:16:05,597
You cooked me something
that's meaningful to you.

244
00:16:06,432 --> 00:16:07,466
That makes me happy.

245
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,302
That's good.

246
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:13,505
What do you want to drink?

247
00:16:15,908 --> 00:16:16,809
Tea?

248
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:24,083
It's not what you think!

249
00:16:25,884 --> 00:16:28,320
Miorin gave it to me.

250
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,322
I said I didn't need it.

251
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:34,960
I see.

252
00:16:36,261 --> 00:16:37,296
What a relief.

253
00:16:40,599 --> 00:16:42,234
I thought you were scared of me.

254
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:48,207
You've been acting nervous
ever since I rolled your sleeve.

255
00:16:50,309 --> 00:16:53,012
I don't think coming over
automatically means that.

256
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,581
What was Mio thinking?

257
00:16:56,715 --> 00:17:02,221
Sorry, I really invited you over today
just to make this hot pot for you.

258
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:04,857
Yeah, I know.

259
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:10,496
Don't worry, I want to take things slow.

260
00:17:11,463 --> 00:17:12,364
Hikaru.

261
00:17:13,098 --> 00:17:16,869
I'd be lying if I said
I wasn't interested in it at all.

262
00:17:17,936 --> 00:17:20,672
But hearing you say you love me

263
00:17:21,907 --> 00:17:24,376
makes me plenty happy for now.

264
00:17:30,516 --> 00:17:31,450
So how long

265
00:17:32,985 --> 00:17:35,054
have you had feelings for me?

266
00:17:36,355 --> 00:17:37,222
Why?

267
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:38,690
For me,

268
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,162
it's when Shu said
he was going to take you to Korea.

269
00:17:43,228 --> 00:17:46,331
So I only realized it recently.

270
00:17:47,699 --> 00:17:48,534
Right.

271
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:53,872
But if you've liked me for a while now,

272
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:58,143
I'm afraid I've done a lot
of insensitive things to you.

273
00:18:01,947 --> 00:18:04,149
Don't worry about that.

274
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:07,352
Miorin gave me the lingerie.

275
00:18:08,353 --> 00:18:13,025
Which made me think
that I had to meet your expectations.

276
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:26,338
I feel like I'm going to die
from embarrassment right now.

277
00:18:27,372 --> 00:18:28,207
Why?

278
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,344
Because

279
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:39,118
it's not like I'm not interested
in that stuff either.

280
00:18:42,354 --> 00:18:43,589
Really?

281
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,824
Yes.

282
00:18:49,328 --> 00:18:50,462
Then, can I kiss you?

283
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:53,899
- What?
- You know…

284
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:03,275
I probably liked you from the beginning.

285
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:40,579
<i>I feel like being in a relationship</i>
<i>is like creating many secrets together.</i>

286
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:47,519
<i>I guess the two of us</i>
<i>aren't just friends anymore.</i>

287
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,856
What? Mom?

288
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:53,158
<i>I like any version of you.</i>

289
00:19:53,225 --> 00:19:55,060
<i>Hikaru has been really busy.</i>

290
00:19:55,127 --> 00:19:56,929
I thought I had a chance.

291
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:57,896
<i>Hold on.</i>

292
00:19:57,963 --> 00:19:58,864
<i>I can't.</i>

293
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:01,900
Only insecure men get jealous.

294
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,402
I'm taking Haruka back.

295
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:04,836
