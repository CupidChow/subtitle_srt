1
00:00:04,504 --> 00:00:08,808
<i>Hikaru has been really busy</i>
<i>since becoming Tohko Miyoshi's assistant.</i>

2
00:00:08,875 --> 00:00:10,477
Why are you with Kurotaki?

3
00:00:10,543 --> 00:00:14,547
Only insecure men get jealous,
you hear me?

4
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:15,882
You want to try harder?

5
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:18,251
<i>Then should you be partying now?</i>

6
00:00:18,318 --> 00:00:20,487
<i>How did things come to this?</i>

7
00:00:23,056 --> 00:00:24,457
INCOMING CALL

8
00:00:27,761 --> 00:00:28,728
Hey, it's me.

9
00:00:28,795 --> 00:00:33,700
- <i>What? Why are you--</i>
- Do you remember what you said to me once?

10
00:00:34,701 --> 00:00:35,535
<i>What?</i>

11
00:00:36,169 --> 00:00:37,070
About Haruka.

12
00:00:37,637 --> 00:00:40,006
You'd better cherish her.
I'll kill you if you hurt her.

13
00:00:41,941 --> 00:00:43,143
That's rich.

14
00:00:43,977 --> 00:00:45,512
You better come get her.

15
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:47,280
Or else

16
00:00:49,182 --> 00:00:50,283
I'm taking her back.

17
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:58,992
Over my dead body!

18
00:00:59,859 --> 00:01:00,693
Hikaru?

19
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:04,964
Wow.

20
00:01:06,132 --> 00:01:07,333
You're so loved.

21
00:01:09,369 --> 00:01:10,470
I'll kill you.

22
00:01:11,704 --> 00:01:13,339
I mean, each other.

23
00:01:16,109 --> 00:01:18,011
Okay, I'm off then.

24
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:18,945
Later.

25
00:01:23,316 --> 00:01:24,184
Um…

26
00:01:25,018 --> 00:01:26,986
- Sorry for what I said.
- No, no.

27
00:01:28,054 --> 00:01:28,955
Me too.

28
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:31,658
I need to apologize too.

29
00:01:33,193 --> 00:01:34,094
But

30
00:01:35,061 --> 00:01:36,062
before that.

31
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:41,501
I love you, Hikaru!

32
00:01:45,939 --> 00:01:48,108
I definitely love you more.

33
00:01:49,008 --> 00:01:52,745
<i>It doesn't matter how many times we fight,</i>
<i>as long as I feel like this.</i>

34
00:01:52,812 --> 00:01:55,115
<i>He's the only one I want to be with.</i>

35
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:03,857
Thanks for the bath.

36
00:02:04,524 --> 00:02:05,358
Sure.

37
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:11,831
You seem stiff. Are you nervous?

38
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:14,467
Of course I am.

39
00:02:15,635 --> 00:02:17,403
We don't have to do anything.

40
00:02:18,171 --> 00:02:19,439
No, I want to.

41
00:02:22,008 --> 00:02:22,876
Look.

42
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,514
Here.

43
00:02:30,116 --> 00:02:31,251
Can I open it?

44
00:02:33,419 --> 00:02:36,823
I was going to give this to you
on our date.

45
00:02:38,057 --> 00:02:40,927
To remind you of me when we're apart.

46
00:02:45,098 --> 00:02:47,300
It's so cute!

47
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:49,536
Let me do it.

48
00:02:58,444 --> 00:03:00,547
No way! It fits perfectly!

49
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:06,386
Sorry for making you feel lonely.

50
00:03:08,421 --> 00:03:10,557
Did you start working for Mio

51
00:03:11,791 --> 00:03:13,860
because I've been busy?

52
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:19,933
That's part of it.

53
00:03:21,367 --> 00:03:25,905
But it's also me wanting to match
the hard work you're putting in.

54
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:30,243
I don't want you to leave me behind.

55
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:32,312
I'd never do that.

56
00:03:34,614 --> 00:03:37,217
I want to be someone who belongs with you.

57
00:03:37,984 --> 00:03:41,387
I want to become the version of me
who can be by your side.

58
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:46,726
But I end up thinking about you
all the time.

59
00:03:48,094 --> 00:03:50,330
That's crazy, right?

60
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,468
What are you grinning about?

61
00:03:59,205 --> 00:04:01,975
If you're crazy, I'm even crazier.

62
00:04:02,609 --> 00:04:03,443
Huh?

63
00:04:05,912 --> 00:04:08,181
Do you know why lovers give rings?

64
00:04:16,689 --> 00:04:17,690
It's a bond.

65
00:04:18,992 --> 00:04:20,760
I want you all to myself.

66
00:04:27,333 --> 00:04:29,902
Just keep thinking only about me.

67
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,583
Are you scared?

68
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:48,021
I'm not.

69
00:04:52,091 --> 00:04:52,992
<i>What scares me</i>

70
00:04:54,394 --> 00:04:56,729
<i>is how I only care about you.</i>

71
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,245
<i>Hey, let's make a bucket list</i>
<i>of things to do together.</i>

72
00:05:12,312 --> 00:05:13,279
COUPLE BUCKET LIST

73
00:05:13,346 --> 00:05:14,347
<i>Good idea.</i>

74
00:05:14,414 --> 00:05:15,481
<i>That sounds fun.</i>

75
00:05:15,548 --> 00:05:16,883
TRAVEL WITH OVERNIGHT STAY

76
00:05:16,949 --> 00:05:18,017
LIVE TOGETHER

77
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:19,786
5 YEARS LATER

78
00:05:19,852 --> 00:05:22,689
<i>It means applying makeup to your soul,</i>
<i>not your face.</i>

79
00:05:22,755 --> 00:05:24,691
<i>Makeup to your soul?</i>

80
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:27,994
While makeup changes your appearance
to build confidence,

81
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:30,830
the magic ends when you take it off.

82
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:34,734
I don't want to use makeup
like it's armor.

83
00:05:35,568 --> 00:05:38,871
He was able to go independent
in only five years. That's our Hikaru!

84
00:05:39,572 --> 00:05:42,875
He said he couldn't have done it
without your support, you know?

85
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:47,413
I mean, our company also benefits
from working with him.

86
00:05:49,449 --> 00:05:52,151
You've also changed over the past years.

87
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:56,589
I can't believe I'm working
for a cosmetics company.

88
00:05:56,656 --> 00:05:59,459
It never would've happened
if I hadn't met Hikaru.

89
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:03,996
Being a different version
of your usual self by wearing makeup

90
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:08,201
can become like your good luck charm.

91
00:06:13,973 --> 00:06:15,675
How do you get those long lashes?

92
00:06:15,742 --> 00:06:17,377
Or that radiant skin!

93
00:06:17,443 --> 00:06:20,313
I have no confidence.

94
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,715
I want to be able to like myself.

95
00:06:28,521 --> 00:06:33,493
I truly believe that makeup
can profoundly influence a person's life.

96
00:06:38,131 --> 00:06:40,833
<i>To me, a beautiful person</i>

97
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:43,302
<i>is anyone who is confident.</i>

98
00:06:44,303 --> 00:06:48,541
I want to apply makeup to their soul
to draw out their inner beauty.

99
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:50,576
And

100
00:06:51,778 --> 00:06:55,415
have them realize the beauty
they had all along.

101
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:14,333
<i>That's my job.</i>

102
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,136
<i>Let's ask one final question for…</i>

103
00:07:17,203 --> 00:07:18,204
I'm home.

104
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:19,739
Welcome home.

105
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,709
- Keep it on.
- Huh?

106
00:07:24,343 --> 00:07:27,313
<i>What's important is to know yourself.</i>

107
00:07:28,381 --> 00:07:32,151
<i>While people around you</i>
<i>may not understand you,</i>

108
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:36,289
<i>you'll find your path</i>
<i>if you keep moving forward.</i>

109
00:07:36,355 --> 00:07:38,491
<i>- Thank you.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

110
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:43,196
<i>This has been a live broadcast</i>
<i>from Hikaru Makeup Salon.</i>

111
00:07:43,262 --> 00:07:45,832
<i>Thank you, Mr. Hikaru Kamiyama.</i>

112
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:49,569
I was so nervous.

113
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:50,570
Yeah, right.

114
00:07:51,237 --> 00:07:52,839
"That's my job."

115
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,075
I didn't pose like that.

116
00:07:58,878 --> 00:08:01,080
But it was a good interview.

117
00:08:02,748 --> 00:08:05,351
I'm happy you're getting recognition.

118
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:08,855
But as you know,

119
00:08:09,422 --> 00:08:10,957
he tends to lose his nerve.

120
00:08:11,591 --> 00:08:13,826
Too scared to leave his comfort zone.

121
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:16,329
Make sure you stay on him.

122
00:08:16,395 --> 00:08:19,732
Who do you think you are?

123
00:08:21,167 --> 00:08:24,971
I had no idea what you were thinking
for the longest time, Shu.

124
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:28,608
But you really care about Hikaru a lot.

125
00:08:29,475 --> 00:08:33,579
Actually, there was a time when
I thought you hated me.

126
00:08:34,614 --> 00:08:37,483
I could never hate the person
Hikaru cares about.

127
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:43,723
I'll keep trying to be someone
worthy of Hikaru.

128
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,958
Please take care of him.

129
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:51,097
You know, are you guys
not thinking about marriage yet?

130
00:08:51,163 --> 00:08:54,534
- Oh…
- It's still a bit early for marriage!

131
00:08:55,635 --> 00:08:56,536
What?

132
00:08:56,602 --> 00:08:58,871
We need to focus on our careers,

133
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:01,574
so marriage is still far down the line.

134
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:04,710
I see.

135
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:09,982
<i>I'm sure Hikaru wants to focus on</i>
<i>the business he just started.</i>

136
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:12,618
<i>I don't want to pressure him.</i>

137
00:09:12,685 --> 00:09:16,022
So I'm happy just to be together for now.

138
00:09:21,494 --> 00:09:22,328
Well,

139
00:09:22,962 --> 00:09:23,863
good luck.

140
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,973
What?! Not thinking about marriage?

141
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:37,209
Of course she'd dump you for that!

142
00:09:37,276 --> 00:09:40,346
Not yet! I told her
I'm not thinking about marriage <i>yet</i>!

143
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:43,015
I met her three months ago!

144
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:46,619
You're still so clueless, Keisuke.

145
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,587
How so?!

146
00:09:49,589 --> 00:09:54,860
Women are always doing the math
inside their head.

147
00:09:56,963 --> 00:09:59,532
If she wants a baby by 30,

148
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:01,200
she'd want to get married by 28.

149
00:10:02,068 --> 00:10:04,670
But if you have to date a while first,

150
00:10:04,737 --> 00:10:07,340
you start thinking about marriage
around 25, 26.

151
00:10:07,406 --> 00:10:08,841
Totally reasonable!

152
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:11,377
Good point.

153
00:10:13,846 --> 00:10:16,349
So do you think about marriage then?

154
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,249
Huh?

155
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:20,753
That's none of your business.

156
00:10:20,820 --> 00:10:21,687
Of course it is.

157
00:10:22,688 --> 00:10:24,757
If you're unhappy, I feel hurt as well.

158
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:31,030
I keep telling you!
That's exactly what I'm talking about!

159
00:10:32,598 --> 00:10:33,599
Honestly!

160
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,937
- Excuse me, could I get another?
- Certainly.

161
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,739
- Really?!
- Huh?

162
00:10:41,374 --> 00:10:42,441
Did you want to leave?

163
00:10:43,275 --> 00:10:45,011
Are you kidding me?

164
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,948
- Long time no see, Haruka!
- Long time no see!

165
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:50,583
Your coworker?

166
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,585
Yeah, we're coming from an event.

167
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:54,153
I missed you.

168
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:56,322
It's my last month here.

169
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:57,223
Oh?

170
00:10:58,891 --> 00:10:59,859
Ta-da!

171
00:11:03,562 --> 00:11:05,197
Sorry for having lucked out!

172
00:11:06,198 --> 00:11:09,101
I'm so happy you're happy!

173
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:10,336
Dang it!

174
00:11:10,403 --> 00:11:12,038
Beer and skewers on me.

175
00:11:12,104 --> 00:11:13,105
Yay!

176
00:11:13,172 --> 00:11:14,674
Not that I own this place.

177
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:16,776
Excuse me!

178
00:11:16,842 --> 00:11:18,344
- Two beers!
- Okay.

179
00:11:18,411 --> 00:11:20,880
- Boss, two beers!
- Okay!

180
00:11:20,946 --> 00:11:23,215
But really, congratulations.

181
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:25,618
You've been with Hikaru
a long time, right?

182
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:27,787
Isn't it about time?

183
00:11:27,853 --> 00:11:28,854
For marriage!

184
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:31,757
I'm not so sure.

185
00:11:31,824 --> 00:11:33,125
Look at you blush!

186
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:35,227
Just do it!

187
00:11:35,294 --> 00:11:36,629
Right.

188
00:11:36,696 --> 00:11:38,164
You just gotta go for it.

189
00:11:39,965 --> 00:11:42,234
It's been five years, huh?

190
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:47,206
I'll do your hair and makeup tomorrow.

191
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,808
Really?

192
00:11:49,809 --> 00:11:51,644
It's our five-year anniversary.

193
00:11:51,711 --> 00:11:54,413
I'm the one who makes you the prettiest.

194
00:12:15,668 --> 00:12:16,602
Have a seat.

195
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:24,443
I just remembered the first day
you cast your magic on me.

196
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,078
Come on, sit down.

197
00:12:28,147 --> 00:12:29,715
I'll cast a spell on you.

198
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,720
Your spell changed my life.

199
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:38,457
I was just the trigger.

200
00:12:40,192 --> 00:12:42,228
You changed your life by yourself.

201
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:00,212
This color matches you and your outfit
the best today.

202
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,582
Wow, you considered all that for me?

203
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:05,718
I'm a professional, after all.

204
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:13,225
Such a pretty color.

205
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:15,427
- Thank you.
- Of course.

206
00:13:16,929 --> 00:13:19,331
Sorry, I'll try to finish up
as soon as I can.

207
00:13:20,032 --> 00:13:22,101
- Please look forward to it.
- Okay.

208
00:13:26,605 --> 00:13:27,740
Welcome.

209
00:13:29,074 --> 00:13:31,510
I'm here to pick up the personalized gift.

210
00:13:32,278 --> 00:13:33,445
One moment, please.

211
00:13:38,884 --> 00:13:40,653
This should be the one.

212
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,589
Please look it over.

213
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:46,525
It's so beautiful!

214
00:13:47,526 --> 00:13:52,364
The more it's used,
the more it gains character.

215
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:53,299
Right.

216
00:13:53,365 --> 00:13:55,367
I'm sure he'll love it.

217
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:30,736
He's late.

218
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,882
HARUKA FUKUNAGA

219
00:14:44,583 --> 00:14:46,051
<i>The number you've called…</i>

220
00:14:53,726 --> 00:14:55,728
A truck drove onto the sidewalk.

221
00:14:55,794 --> 00:14:58,364
They said a young man was taken
to the hospital.

222
00:14:59,164 --> 00:15:00,132
Hospital?

223
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,069
<i>Hikaru?</i>

224
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:14,480
<i>Wait, do they only allow family</i>
<i>to come into the hospital?</i>

225
00:15:15,481 --> 00:15:17,750
<i>Do I have to be family to be with him?</i>

226
00:15:30,296 --> 00:15:31,163
Haruka?

227
00:15:32,965 --> 00:15:34,066
Sorry I'm late.

228
00:15:40,539 --> 00:15:41,473
What's wrong?

229
00:15:42,541 --> 00:15:43,976
Let's get married.

230
00:15:44,043 --> 00:15:45,177
Hikaru.

231
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,448
I don't want to feel like this again.

232
00:15:50,649 --> 00:15:53,686
I can't think of a life without you!

233
00:15:53,752 --> 00:15:55,955
Let's get married right now!

234
00:15:59,725 --> 00:16:02,428
Thank you for reserving
the entire restaurant.

235
00:16:10,769 --> 00:16:13,305
Since you managed to ask me out first,

236
00:16:14,139 --> 00:16:16,041
I wanted to beat you this time.

237
00:16:18,911 --> 00:16:21,180
Why did you have to say it first again?

238
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:23,716
Here.

239
00:16:26,618 --> 00:16:27,519
Open it.

240
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:29,555
Okay.

241
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:41,433
Wow!

242
00:16:42,001 --> 00:16:43,635
Are they real glass slippers?

243
00:16:46,038 --> 00:16:47,106
Wait.

244
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:51,043
I WANT TO WEAR A CINDERELLA DRESS
CAN'T DRAW GLASS SLIPPERS

245
00:16:54,213 --> 00:16:57,082
How did you even remember this?

246
00:17:01,754 --> 00:17:06,658
I wanted to be the prince,
not the fairy godmother, Haruka.

247
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:13,866
But I can't be all manly either.

248
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,101
Not that I want to.

249
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,038
Hence this awkward proposal.

250
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:25,010
I always end up looking silly
in front of you.

251
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:32,217
But, Haruka…

252
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,288
you always face me head-on.

253
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,758
It made me love myself.

254
00:18:04,850 --> 00:18:06,952
I may not be a very cool prince,

255
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,322
but I want you by my side.

256
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:15,928
What do you mean?

257
00:18:17,963 --> 00:18:20,432
You're a prince who can use magic.

258
00:18:21,767 --> 00:18:24,403
Is there anyone cooler than that?

259
00:18:32,611 --> 00:18:33,979
Will you marry me?

260
00:18:43,956 --> 00:18:44,790
Yes.

261
00:19:05,544 --> 00:19:09,715
<i>I've learned to love myself</i>
<i>thanks to your magic.</i>

262
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:20,025
<i>I can handle anything if I'm with you.</i>

263
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,502
<i>Because being together makes me happy.</i>

264
00:19:44,049 --> 00:19:45,517
STRAWBERRY PICKING
PLAY BASKETBALL

265
00:19:45,584 --> 00:19:47,085
GET MARRIED!

266
00:19:47,686 --> 00:19:49,755
