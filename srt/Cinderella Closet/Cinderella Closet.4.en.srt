1
00:00:04,637 --> 00:00:07,407
<i>Really, I'm just a regular guy</i>
<i>you find anywhere.</i>

2
00:00:07,474 --> 00:00:10,944
If we were to date, I want to wait
until we know each other better.

3
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:13,913
I'm happy you've really
put some thought into this.

4
00:00:15,215 --> 00:00:16,683
You look exactly like someone I know.

5
00:00:16,750 --> 00:00:19,786
<i>Being so happy-go-lucky,</i>
<i>I bet that's what she likes.</i>

6
00:00:20,420 --> 00:00:22,122
- You have a crush.
- What?

7
00:00:22,188 --> 00:00:23,890
<i>So, what's your name?</i>

8
00:00:26,192 --> 00:00:27,127
<i>Got it, Koichi!</i>

9
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,397
Hikaru. I love you.

10
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:40,840
Mr. Kurotaki.

11
00:00:41,608 --> 00:00:44,344
Table three is ready for the check.

12
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,513
I've talked to Mr. Kurotaki on the phone
every day since!

13
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,185
I mean, the other day he fell asleep
while we were mid-conversation!

14
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:26,786
So I listened to him sleep.

15
00:01:27,987 --> 00:01:30,290
You're already acting like a couple.

16
00:01:30,356 --> 00:01:31,991
Just make it official already.

17
00:01:33,226 --> 00:01:34,160
Really?

18
00:01:35,195 --> 00:01:38,431
But I'm okay keeping things
like this for a little longer.

19
00:01:38,998 --> 00:01:41,000
We've been too busy to get together.

20
00:01:43,203 --> 00:01:44,304
Why put it off?

21
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:49,409
If I'm going to ask him out again,

22
00:01:51,444 --> 00:01:55,482
I want to learn more about him first, too.

23
00:01:56,449 --> 00:01:59,285
And I want him to know more
about me as well.

24
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:02,789
Seems like you two already have a bond.

25
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,059
Speak of the devil.

26
00:02:07,927 --> 00:02:09,462
He has a favor to ask?

27
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,804
Sorry! I hogged the conversation again.

28
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,839
What's going on with you?

29
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:23,042
I'm focusing my time on job hunting.

30
00:02:23,643 --> 00:02:26,379
I'm busy putting together a show
to help my job hunt.

31
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:29,949
Right, trade school students
graduate after two years.

32
00:02:32,452 --> 00:02:35,488
Which is why I can't just hang out
with you all the time.

33
00:02:49,369 --> 00:02:50,970
- Done.
- Yeah?

34
00:02:52,071 --> 00:02:54,073
You're a lifesaver.

35
00:02:54,908 --> 00:02:59,646
I panicked this morning when I heard
the hair and makeup person fell through.

36
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,483
Then I remembered you're in beauty school.

37
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,486
You're fine with just some student?

38
00:03:06,553 --> 00:03:07,720
Huh? Of course!

39
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:10,390
The owner was happy, too.

40
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:12,592
Plus, you did a great job.

41
00:03:13,726 --> 00:03:14,661
So breezy.

42
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,696
Sir!

43
00:03:17,263 --> 00:03:19,065
Koichi here is looking for a job.

44
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,101
Could you introduce him to some people?

45
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:23,002
Of course.

46
00:03:23,603 --> 00:03:25,872
I'd be happy to help, if I can.

47
00:03:26,506 --> 00:03:28,174
- Thank you.
- Thanks, sir!

48
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:30,176
Great.

49
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:33,479
You've got crazy people skills.

50
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:36,983
Anyway, how are things going with you?

51
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:37,984
What do you mean?

52
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,786
With your crush!

53
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,322
Forget about me.

54
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,390
- Well, with me--
- I didn't ask.

55
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,093
I mean, it's going well.

56
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,664
Like I care.

57
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,733
She'll actually be here soon,
so you can meet her.

58
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:55,635
What? Why?

59
00:03:55,702 --> 00:03:56,903
I asked her to help out.

60
00:03:59,272 --> 00:04:00,406
She's here.

61
00:04:01,274 --> 00:04:02,141
Okay.

62
00:04:03,009 --> 00:04:04,010
<i>Crap!</i>

63
00:04:05,511 --> 00:04:06,379
Haruka!

64
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,149
You look a little different from usual.

65
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:12,352
It's the clothes and Koichi's skills.

66
00:04:12,418 --> 00:04:13,419
Koichi?

67
00:04:13,486 --> 00:04:14,354
I'll introduce you.

68
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:16,556
Huh?

69
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,523
Koichi?

70
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:19,692
Where'd he go?

71
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,828
I can't get caught.

72
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:22,795
Your friend?

73
00:04:22,862 --> 00:04:25,598
Things were chaotic this morning,

74
00:04:25,665 --> 00:04:27,600
and he helped do my hair and makeup.

75
00:04:27,667 --> 00:04:28,868
I wanted you to meet.

76
00:04:29,636 --> 00:04:32,572
Really? I wonder where he went.

77
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:33,473
For real.

78
00:04:34,173 --> 00:04:35,041
The bathroom?

79
00:04:36,142 --> 00:04:37,277
What's he like?

80
00:04:37,844 --> 00:04:41,814
He talks all mean,
but he's actually a good guy.

81
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:44,951
<i>Sorry, I got a sudden stomach ache.</i>

82
00:04:45,018 --> 00:04:46,653
<i>My job's done so I'm heading home.</i>

83
00:04:47,353 --> 00:04:49,255
I guess he got a stomach ache.

84
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,791
- I wonder if he's okay.
- Oh, no! One second.

85
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:56,095
I have some stomach medicine.

86
00:04:56,162 --> 00:04:57,797
It works well, so I'll give him some.

87
00:04:57,864 --> 00:04:59,966
Okay, the bathroom's that way.

88
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:01,401
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

89
00:05:02,268 --> 00:05:04,170
He'll want a hot drink.

90
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:06,339
<i>Okay, now's my chance!</i>

91
00:05:10,677 --> 00:05:12,011
What's his name again?

92
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:12,912
Koichi.

93
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:14,147
That's right!

94
00:05:14,213 --> 00:05:15,415
<i>My bag!</i>

95
00:05:20,887 --> 00:05:21,988
He wasn't there.

96
00:05:25,491 --> 00:05:26,426
Hikaru?

97
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,594
What are you doing here?

98
00:05:28,661 --> 00:05:30,496
No, this is Koichi.

99
00:05:30,563 --> 00:05:32,365
What are you talking about?

100
00:05:32,432 --> 00:05:34,801
I wouldn't mistake Hikaru.

101
00:05:37,303 --> 00:05:39,238
What are you doing, Hikaru?

102
00:05:43,643 --> 00:05:45,044
You mean, that Hikaru?

103
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:49,716
Well, yeah.

104
00:05:52,685 --> 00:05:53,553
What now?

105
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,460
So you're a cross-dresser?

106
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:03,229
Yeah.

107
00:06:04,764 --> 00:06:05,565
What?

108
00:06:07,266 --> 00:06:09,102
You bunked with Haruka?

109
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:11,571
- No!
- What's this about?

110
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,708
Yes, I was with Hikaru,
but we didn't do anything!

111
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:17,844
I figured that, but.

112
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:21,214
Sorry, but this is a hard pass.

113
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:24,250
Wait, Mr. Kurotaki!

114
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,290
So you're a cross-dresser?

115
00:06:32,892 --> 00:06:33,726
Yeah.

116
00:06:35,161 --> 00:06:36,729
Wow, makeup's amazing.

117
00:06:38,264 --> 00:06:40,767
Why did you tell me your name was Koichi?

118
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,938
I was messing with you.

119
00:06:46,506 --> 00:06:49,308
I thought Haruka fell for
some shady playboy.

120
00:06:49,876 --> 00:06:52,178
Call it a background check, I guess.

121
00:06:53,212 --> 00:06:54,046
You pass.

122
00:06:56,616 --> 00:06:58,017
- Hikaru's--
- Mr. Kurotaki!

123
00:06:58,084 --> 00:06:59,485
Standby, please.

124
00:06:59,552 --> 00:07:00,520
Okay.

125
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:01,521
Well.

126
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,722
I'll be right back.

127
00:07:04,023 --> 00:07:04,957
I'm ready.

128
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:15,468
I don't think Hikaru was messing with you.

129
00:07:16,903 --> 00:07:19,872
I think he lied for my sake.

130
00:07:20,706 --> 00:07:21,574
Yeah?

131
00:07:23,309 --> 00:07:27,213
One time he was worried I'd be judged

132
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,750
for hanging around a guy
who cross-dresses.

133
00:07:32,218 --> 00:07:33,953
I'm really sorry.

134
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:35,588
You don't need to apologize.

135
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,391
I see.

136
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:42,895
But

137
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:46,098
how'd you become friends
when you're so different?

138
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:51,771
Hikaru cast a spell on me.

139
00:07:53,439 --> 00:07:54,707
It's so amazing.

140
00:07:54,774 --> 00:08:00,279
It was a spell that gave me confidence
and courage.

141
00:08:00,346 --> 00:08:01,647
Really?

142
00:08:03,115 --> 00:08:04,584
When I'm with Hikaru,

143
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:07,887
I can love myself.

144
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:13,893
Mr. Kurotaki?

145
00:08:15,228 --> 00:08:16,062
Sorry.

146
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:18,698
Thanks for helping out today.

147
00:08:19,365 --> 00:08:20,333
My pleasure!

148
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:23,302
Thank you for walking me this way.

149
00:08:23,870 --> 00:08:25,304
Later then.

150
00:08:25,371 --> 00:08:26,205
Later!

151
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:33,145
Is Koichi's crush…

152
00:08:37,583 --> 00:08:42,555
Use moisturizing serum
to hydrate the skin.

153
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:44,857
Put it in your hand

154
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,294
and warm it up to body temperature.

155
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:54,901
Then cover your cheeks with your hands.

156
00:09:03,976 --> 00:09:06,612
Hikaru mentioned
he was job hunting, right?

157
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,295
- Maybe I'll pick this.
- That's a good one.

158
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:25,631
What about that color?

159
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:41,280
"I can't rely on Hikaru forever,
but I don't know which looks good."

160
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:43,683
- Am I right?
- Why are you here?

161
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:50,156
Shu told me he saw you frozen
in the cosmetics section.

162
00:09:50,222 --> 00:09:51,591
Why didn't you ask me?

163
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:54,126
It's not like that. Um…

164
00:09:54,193 --> 00:09:56,829
Which one would you buy for yourself?

165
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:59,031
What?

166
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:00,900
Idiot.

167
00:10:00,967 --> 00:10:04,470
We don't have the same skin tone,
so our colors are different.

168
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:09,175
But this one would work for us.

169
00:10:09,241 --> 00:10:11,777
I didn't come to pick one for myself!

170
00:10:13,746 --> 00:10:17,183
The thing is,
I wanted to buy you a present.

171
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:19,151
Huh? Why?

172
00:10:20,152 --> 00:10:22,822
Because I want to wish you good luck
on job hunting.

173
00:10:22,888 --> 00:10:26,359
To thank you for all your help,
and to support you.

174
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:30,296
Honestly.

175
00:10:31,464 --> 00:10:34,133
You're hardly ready to pick yourself.

176
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,468
Plus, you're an idiot.

177
00:10:36,535 --> 00:10:38,404
I wouldn't go to an interview in drag.

178
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,678
But I appreciate the thought.

179
00:10:46,379 --> 00:10:48,614
Seriously, I know money's tight.

180
00:10:48,681 --> 00:10:49,515
Thank you.

181
00:10:49,582 --> 00:10:51,684
Don't worry! I just got paid!

182
00:10:51,751 --> 00:10:52,685
It's fine.

183
00:10:52,752 --> 00:10:53,452
No!

184
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:54,387
- It's fine.
- No!

185
00:10:54,453 --> 00:10:56,956
- I'm buying you something, so pick!
- It's fine.

186
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:59,892
- How come?
- Are you even listening to me? Fine!

187
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:01,060
- Please!
- Excuse me.

188
00:11:01,127 --> 00:11:01,961
Can I get help?

189
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:02,795
Let me buy it!

190
00:11:02,862 --> 00:11:06,065
Could I get two of this one?

191
00:11:06,132 --> 00:11:07,633
- Sure.
- I can't afford two.

192
00:11:08,134 --> 00:11:10,836
I got a matching one with Hikaru!

193
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:14,006
Cut that out, it's embarrassing.

194
00:11:14,073 --> 00:11:16,442
Come on! Let me be happy.

195
00:11:16,509 --> 00:11:18,477
Giving each other presents.

196
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,680
I'll never forget this.

197
00:11:21,781 --> 00:11:22,615
Yeah.

198
00:11:23,182 --> 00:11:26,719
Okay, now I'll work hard on my makeup,

199
00:11:26,786 --> 00:11:29,488
and ask Mr. Kurotaki out on a date.

200
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:34,560
By the way, he wasn't mad at all.

201
00:11:34,627 --> 00:11:37,196
He complimented how good your makeup was.

202
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:43,369
Do you want to
put this lipstick on together?

203
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:44,804
What?

204
00:11:46,305 --> 00:11:47,740
- Come on!
- You're kidding.

205
00:11:50,042 --> 00:11:50,876
Honestly.

206
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:53,479
How will you do that without a mirror?

207
00:11:55,848 --> 00:11:56,682
Um.

208
00:11:57,683 --> 00:11:58,851
- Then--
- Give it to me.

209
00:12:00,186 --> 00:12:01,020
Here.

210
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:30,483
Does it look good?

211
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:36,889
Who do you think picked it?

212
00:12:37,723 --> 00:12:38,858
Of course.

213
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:39,759
Here.

214
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:40,659
Thanks.

215
00:12:43,329 --> 00:12:44,430
Now then.

216
00:12:56,776 --> 00:12:58,110
So pretty!

217
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,779
Obviously.

218
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:01,814
Of course.

219
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,486
When I put this on,

220
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:09,789
it feels like you're with me.

221
00:13:12,391 --> 00:13:13,626
Like a good luck charm.

222
00:13:27,907 --> 00:13:29,942
<i>You're going to wear this and kiss him?</i>

223
00:13:37,483 --> 00:13:40,586
We're a long way from kissing still!

224
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:43,722
What are you even talking about?

225
00:13:50,896 --> 00:13:52,131
I should go home, yeah!

226
00:13:54,533 --> 00:13:55,367
What?

227
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,335
I'm going home.

228
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:57,736
I'm so embarrassed.

229
00:13:59,805 --> 00:14:01,373
You can go on ahead.

230
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:02,308
Okay.

231
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:13,652
<i>Want to go out the next day</i>
<i>that we're both off from work?</i>

232
00:14:23,829 --> 00:14:25,064
You have a crush.

233
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,599
What? Like hell I do!

234
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,304
Actually, yeah, I do.

235
00:14:42,982 --> 00:14:43,849
Hello?

236
00:14:44,550 --> 00:14:46,952
Sorry, you think we can meet now?

237
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:52,057
Hikaru!

238
00:14:59,465 --> 00:15:00,833
Haruka, that outfit.

239
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:05,004
I picked it out from an affordable shop
you introduced to me.

240
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:06,872
What do you think?

241
00:15:08,107 --> 00:15:09,942
You did your hair and makeup too?

242
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:12,111
Yeah.

243
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,347
So,

244
00:15:16,515 --> 00:15:18,951
I'm going to go tell Mr. Kurotaki
how I feel.

245
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:24,189
I wanted to let you know before I did.

246
00:15:26,992 --> 00:15:28,127
Six out of ten.

247
00:15:30,529 --> 00:15:32,164
Too much eye shadow.

248
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,299
Too much brow.

249
00:15:34,233 --> 00:15:35,668
You're going like that?

250
00:15:37,169 --> 00:15:40,472
I worked pretty hard on this.

251
00:15:44,276 --> 00:15:45,544
This is your last one.

252
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:47,579
Princess.

253
00:15:58,924 --> 00:16:02,328
I keep relying on you to help me.

254
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:03,996
You noticed?

255
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:06,532
Don't worry about it.

256
00:16:09,702 --> 00:16:15,107
The reason I lied was so I could keep
hanging with you after you started dating,

257
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:18,577
and keep up the image
that I'm a girlfriend.

258
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:20,346
It was for myself.

259
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,450
That's what you were worried about?

260
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:29,588
Whether I start dating
Mr. Kurotaki or not,

261
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:31,223
I'll always be with you.

262
00:16:33,826 --> 00:16:37,196
- <i>Hello?</i>
<i>- </i>Sorry, you think we can meet now?

263
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:39,898
What do you want?

264
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:41,967
Koichi, is your crush on Haruka?

265
00:16:44,136 --> 00:16:45,604
There's no Koichi.

266
00:16:46,205 --> 00:16:48,440
I'm really sorry.

267
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,244
Look, don't apologize for that!

268
00:16:52,311 --> 00:16:54,113
- That's what pisses--
- My bad.

269
00:16:54,813 --> 00:16:57,149
I'm probably gonna piss you off even more.

270
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:01,453
So I apologize.

271
00:17:05,557 --> 00:17:06,558
Such confidence.

272
00:17:07,793 --> 00:17:11,697
Haruka told me how important
of a friend you are.

273
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:25,044
You'd better cherish her.

274
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,346
I'll kill you if you hurt her.

275
00:17:34,319 --> 00:17:36,288
There, all done.

276
00:17:37,189 --> 00:17:38,023
Thank you.

277
00:18:46,725 --> 00:18:48,927
You're the one Haruka wants.

278
00:18:49,495 --> 00:18:50,362
Not me.

279
00:18:51,663 --> 00:18:53,065
So get it together.

280
00:18:55,033 --> 00:18:56,435
We're friends.

281
00:19:00,038 --> 00:19:01,106
Mr. Kurotaki.

282
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:02,941
Sorry to keep you waiting.

283
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:04,042
Not at all.

284
00:19:07,112 --> 00:19:07,980
Um.

285
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:13,051
The reason I asked to meet you today

286
00:19:14,253 --> 00:19:15,721
was to tell you something.

287
00:19:15,787 --> 00:19:16,655
Me, too.

288
00:19:17,923 --> 00:19:19,424
I have something to say.

289
00:19:25,931 --> 00:19:27,966
Would you like to date me, Haruka?

290
00:19:49,721 --> 00:19:51,790
<i>This is being a girlfriend!</i>

291
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:53,225
<i>I like Haruka.</i>

292
00:19:53,292 --> 00:19:55,127
Do <i>you </i>actually like her?

293
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,028
Keisuke?

294
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:56,795
Mio?

295
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:57,696
<i>She's my ex.</i>

296
00:19:57,763 --> 00:19:59,665
<i>Do you want to come over?</i>

297
00:19:59,731 --> 00:20:01,300
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

298
00:20:01,366 --> 00:20:03,602
Don't worry, you have Hikaru with you.

299
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:04,870
