Fine.

00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,290
It's perfect that you're still here.

6
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:38,160
Go back and tell your sister

7
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,260
that I'd like to meet her one last time.

8
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:42,250
If she doesn't want

9
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,880

00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:44,500
my impression of her,

00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,560
advice her to stay away from mini skirts.

12
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,700
Seriously.

00:02:57,230 --> 00:02:58,950
Brother, you're awesome!

14
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,850
I have courted him for so long.

15
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:02,130
Getting asked out was impossible.

16
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,130
He never even

17
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:04,200

Oh, that's right.

143

That's because I'm unwavering in my duties.

How could he describe himself as dutiful?

147
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:18,810
You've not just tainted this term,

148
00:10:19,170 --> 00:10:21,010
you've trampled all over it.

149
00:10:21,880 --> 00:10:22,370
Yes.

154
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:32,610
No wonder he's so concerned

155
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:33,380
about his sister's partners.

156
00:10:33,420 --> 00:10:35,600
He lost his parents at such a young age,

157
00:10:35,770 --> 00:10:37,070
and his sister is his only family left.

158
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:39,550

This is a great family.

I've worked as a carpenter.

00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:46,740
I've also made furniture

165
00:10:47,310 --> 00:10:48,290

166

At my poorest,

167
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:52,110
I only ate one meal a day.

168

00:13:13,380 --> 00:13:14,480
Let go!

195
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,670
Let go!

196
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,330
Let go!

197
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:21,420
Brother!

198
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:22,290
Brother!

199
00:13:22,310 --> 00:13:22,990
Save me!

200
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:23,590
Brother!

201
00:13:25,910 --> 00:13:26,730
Brother! Save me! Brother!

202
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,640
That's Yuan Zong's car.

203
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,260
Drive!

204
00:13:28,650 --> 00:13:29,380
Get going!

205
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,050
Brother!

206
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:48,940
What are you doing here?

207
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,050
-Xia Yao, stay away
-Is this guy insane?

208
00:14:13,140 --> 00:14:14,300
Just let her go.

209
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:15,500
-Stop the car.
-Let her go?

210
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,810
- Stop!
-She's a good hostage.

211
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,920
If we don't release her,

212
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:20,380
you'll kill him with your van.

213
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,820
Leave me be.

214
00:14:24,290 --> 00:14:25,010
Let her go!

215
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:25,360
Go.

216
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:32,110
Just you wait!

217
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,520
Xia Yao!

218
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:35,320
Xia Yao! Xia Yao!

219
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,300
Are you okay?

220
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:38,710
I'm fine as long as you keep your hands off me.

221
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:43,480
Brother!

222
00:14:44,470 --> 00:14:45,330
What do we do?

223
00:15:01,710 --> 00:15:02,500
Xia Yao.

224
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:14,070
Mr. Yuan,

225
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:15,210
Instructor Lu sent

226
00:15:15,230 --> 00:15:16,520
those two bodyguards to the hospital.

227
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:18,960
Brother,

228
00:15:19,200 --> 00:15:21,020
were they sent by the Leopard?

229
00:15:24,590 --> 00:15:25,630
Why are you staring at me?

230
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:29,780
How did you know I was looking at you?

231
00:15:31,250 --> 00:15:32,510
I just happened to be in the area.

232
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:33,970
Brother,

233
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,400
Xia Yao hurried over

234
00:15:35,420 --> 00:15:36,390
after my call.

235
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:37,660
I called him

236
00:15:37,690 --> 00:15:38,600
after I called you.

237
00:15:38,710 --> 00:15:40,360
He arrived before you,

238
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,040
and he fought back all by himself.

239
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:44,350
Isn't it obvious that he was worried sick?

240
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,140
You're quite good at making up nonsense.

241
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:49,620
Brother, I'm not making things up.

242
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:51,270
Xia Yao is just shy,

243
00:15:51,310 --> 00:15:52,880
but he really cares about me.

244
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,400
You saw what happened.

245
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:56,790
Xia Yao's feelings for me are genuine.

246
00:15:57,250 --> 00:15:59,780
He's worlds apart from those scumbags.

247
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:04,210
Xia Yao, what's wrong?

248
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,300
You're bleeding!

249
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:10,350
Don't move.

250
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:11,920
Brother, look.

251
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:12,830
What should we do?

252
00:16:12,850 --> 00:16:13,340
Stop the car.

253
00:16:35,180 --> 00:16:36,170
Brother, take a look.

254
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:38,060
Don't move.

255
00:16:51,280 --> 00:16:52,640
I really happened to walk by.

256
00:16:53,510 --> 00:16:54,760
Anyone else would've done the same.

257
00:16:55,840 --> 00:16:56,440
I know.

258
00:17:36,700 --> 00:17:37,430
Go to sleep.

259
00:17:38,290 --> 00:17:38,940
Brother,

260
00:17:39,260 --> 00:17:40,210
I'm scared.

261
00:17:40,330 --> 00:17:40,800
Don't be scared.

262
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:41,800
I'm here.

263
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,090
Did the Leopard send them?

264
00:17:46,360 --> 00:17:47,260
I'm still investigating that.

265
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:49,090
I bet it's him.

266
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,010
He's resorting to such dirty tactics

267
00:17:51,030 --> 00:17:52,370
because he can't beat you.

268
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,020
Thank goodness Xia Yao saved me.

269
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:56,750
Brother.

270
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,560
I still can't get over him.

271
00:18:00,280 --> 00:18:02,100
The moment Xia Yao appeared today,

272
00:18:02,590 --> 00:18:04,070
everything felt like a dream.

273
00:18:04,580 --> 00:18:06,050
My head was up in the clouds.

274
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:08,640
Go get some sleep.
