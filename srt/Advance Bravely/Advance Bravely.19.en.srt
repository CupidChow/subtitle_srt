00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,530
It's about that incident...

10
00:02:46,180 --> 00:02:47,500
If you're here about that,

11
00:02:47,860 --> 00:02:48,660
you can leave.

12
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:51,990
I know I was rather cruel that day,

13
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,579
but you're so easily embarrassed.

14
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:56,540
I can't just accommodate you all the time.

15
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,020
If I beat around the bush,

16
00:02:58,020 --> 00:02:59,990
you might be even more hurt.

Sexual dysfunction is just an excuse I made up.

I told you that

20
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:10,840

98
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:00,830

I used the same trick near the place you were playing cards.

109

Think about this.

110

How can there be such a coincidence?

111

I weaved these lies

114
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:28,300
and then stole your watch

115
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:29,560
so that you would be driven to look for me.

116
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:32,200
After that, I stole liquor

117
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,350
just to get caught.

118
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:34,560
Which idiot

119
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:36,200
would drink stolen liquor

120
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:37,510
on the spot instead of fleeing?

121
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,720
I can't trust him.

122
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:42,380
Everything he says is nonsense.

123
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,370
It's my loss if I take his words seriously.

124
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,300

In the end, those guys pulled some dirty tricks.

138
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,940
They covered Wang Zhishui's face with underwear

139
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:33,850
and provoked him.

140
00:07:34,540 --> 00:07:35,430
He smashed his head onto the ground.

141

00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:41,010
Why is his life at risk now?

143
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:44,250
How would I know that he valued his pride more than his life?

144
00:07:50,090 --> 00:07:50,990
How is he now?

145
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:53,100
We brought him here yesterday,

146
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,659
but his safety was only confirmed today.

have to be hospitalized for some time?

156

We told him the same thing,

157
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:18,420
but he insisted on leaving.

158
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,390

He escaped again.

164
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,210
I bet he's scared that I'll beat him up again.

165
00:09:10,820 --> 00:09:11,500
That's not it.

166
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,820
He's really broke.

167
00:09:13,990 --> 00:09:15,000
If he really wanted to flee,

168
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:16,090
why didn't he take a taxi?

169
00:09:16,510 --> 00:09:17,530
Why did he wait for the bus?

170
00:09:19,540 --> 00:09:20,540
What is your plan?

171
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:24,820
I'll keep looking for him.

172
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,450
You will?

173
00:09:27,490 --> 00:09:28,680
He's already in such misery.

174
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,140
Forgive and forget.

175
00:09:32,430 --> 00:09:33,800
What do you want from him?

176
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,900
Why can't you get over this grudge?

177
00:09:36,030 --> 00:09:36,470
I...

178

193
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:13,820
Use your arms.

194
00:10:15,950 --> 00:10:16,390
Okay,

195
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:16,990
one more time.

196
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,420
Slow down

197
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,320
and do it properly.

198
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,660
One, two, three.

199
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:23,780
Okay.

200
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:24,730
Look up.

201
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:27,240
Nice.

202
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:32,720
Lower your buttocks.

203
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:34,060
Back straight.

204
00:10:34,080 --> 00:10:34,680
Look up.

205
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,180
Okay,

206
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:37,800
lift them back.

207
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:40,820
One, two, three.

208
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:49,210
Everyone, take a break.

209
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,070
Director, how was it?

210
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:51,230
Pretty good.

211
00:10:51,260 --> 00:10:52,060
Everything went well.

212
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,440
You can take a break, too.

213
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,590
We have to set up the cameras.

214
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,290
We'll call you over later.

215
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:55,750
Okay.

216
00:10:56,710 --> 00:10:57,710
Hey, Tao.

217
00:11:11,150 --> 00:11:11,660
What's wrong?

218
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:13,960
I'm tired.

219
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,210
If you're tired, rest in the car.

220
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,240
I'll take you home after everything wraps up.

221
00:11:18,710 --> 00:11:19,500
You don't have to join the afternoon session.

222
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:22,370
I'm not physically tired.

223
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,300
My heart feels worn out.

224
00:11:25,390 --> 00:11:26,260
Do you even have a heart?

225
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,740
Why wouldn't I have one?

226
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:31,230
There's so much on my mind every day.

227
00:11:41,670 --> 00:11:42,150
What are you doing?

228
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:43,530
Give me an allowance.

229
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,960
Are you going to buy junk food again?

230
00:11:46,370 --> 00:11:47,890
I won't buy junk food.

231
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:49,310
I'll buy yummy food.

232
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:51,130
Lies.

233
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,270
You took some money

234
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,940
from my drawer and bought trash.

235
00:11:56,660 --> 00:11:57,460
I took a bite

236
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:58,820
and threw the rest away.

237
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:00,940
Are such things that delicious?

238
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,610
Yes, they are.

239
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,260
The only thing

240
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,860
that tastes good to you is green onion dipped in sauce.

241
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,060
Do you know what?

242
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:17,320
I grew up in a very strict household.

243
00:12:17,490 --> 00:12:18,650
I never got to eat such things.

244
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,160
That's why I'm hooked on them now.

245
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:22,160
If you're so insistent on stopping me,

246
00:12:22,660 --> 00:12:24,210
you'll only spur a greater desire for it.

247
00:12:25,130 --> 00:12:26,460
Only by showering me with such food,

248
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:27,820
you will make me sick of them.

249
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:45,950
¥2.

250
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,150
Do you have loose change?

251
00:12:53,410 --> 00:12:54,010
No.

252
00:12:54,830 --> 00:12:56,070
If you don't, pay with your phone.

253
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:57,910
I want to get loose change.

254
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:08,530
Here you go.

255
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,110
¥98.

256
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,320
How are you spending the new year?

257
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:29,540
I'm going to my hometown.

258
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:31,560
Your hometown?

259
00:13:32,550 --> 00:13:33,240
Hei Longjiang?

260
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:33,830
Umm-humm.

261
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,140
When will you go back?

262
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:40,810
Once this batch of trainees completes their final examination.

263
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:46,050
How long will you be there?

264
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:46,850
A month.

265
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,240
I haven't been back for three years.

266
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,620
My relatives miss me.

267
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,560
I need to visit my parents' grave too.

268
00:14:01,410 --> 00:14:02,650
Sure, go back.

269
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:04,470
Everyone goes home during the new year.

270
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,300
Why are you back so early?

271
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:21,860
What's wrong with coming home early?

272
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,000
Are you keeping secrets from me?

273
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,750
What secrets can I have?

274
00:14:27,640 --> 00:14:29,340
Your dad's superior is coming over for a meal.

275
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:30,160
Be quiet.

276
00:14:30,910 --> 00:14:32,370
My dad isn't home.

277
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,340
Why is his superior coming here?

278
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:35,880
Don't jump to conclusions.

279
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,870
His superior is a woman.

280
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:39,800
What...

281
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:40,200
What...

282
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,890
What is all this?

283
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:42,930
Snacks and local delicacies.

284
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,290
Local delicacies?

285
00:14:44,700 --> 00:14:45,660
From Beijing?

286
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:46,470
Yes.

287
00:14:46,870 --> 00:14:48,180
Why did you buy Beijing delicacies?

288
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:49,260
For my colleagues.

289
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,660
You've never been so nice.

290
00:15:06,610 --> 00:15:07,550
I'm craving food.

291
00:15:17,830 --> 00:15:19,580
Eating a little wouldn't matter, right?

292
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:21,580
I bought so much anyway.

293
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:41,200
I can play games for a bit.

294
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:21,520
No, I can't.

295
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,950
I have to hand them over tomorrow.

296
00:16:24,950 --> 00:16:26,370
If I don't, I'll finish everything.

297
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:44,010
Eat these on the road.

298
00:16:45,380 --> 00:16:47,060
It's only a two-hour flight.

299
00:16:47,350 --> 00:16:48,100
Why did you buy so much for me?

300
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:50,510
You can take them home.

301
00:16:51,620 --> 00:16:53,090
Isn't your hometown a poor mountain village?

302
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:55,530
You'll have to travel far to buy things.

303
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,040
The general store only has cooking necessities.

304
00:16:58,070 --> 00:16:58,980
They don't have any snacks.

305
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,870
I told you about my childhood.

306
00:17:02,170 --> 00:17:03,170
My family has long since moved away.

307
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:07,540
I could have eaten more if I knew that.

308
00:17:08,859 --> 00:17:09,540
But...

309
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,329
I really haven't tried any of these.

310
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:14,089
They might not be sold over there either.

311
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:15,260
Right?

312
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:16,920
There are two more boxes here.

313
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:18,349
Take them back with you.

314
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,220
How did you get those here?

315
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:22,260
I carried them up.

316
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:23,140
By yourself?

317
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,359
Yes,

318
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,569
they aren't heavy.

319
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:29,310
Why are you so silly?

320
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:32,570
You can check them in.

321
00:17:32,870 --> 00:17:33,710
If you can't,

322
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:34,650
you can mail them back.

323
00:17:35,180 --> 00:17:36,250
They won't expire so quickly.

324
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,110
There are piles of New Year goodies in my house every year.

325
00:17:39,420 --> 00:17:40,340
It's a waste if we can't finish them.

326
00:17:41,020 --> 00:17:41,860
Take some home.

327
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:43,160
You can enjoy them

328
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:44,820
or give them to your relatives.

329
00:17:45,180 --> 00:17:46,450
It's a token from me.

330
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,390
I'll see you off for your flight.

331
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:50,870
I can help you carry some.

332
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:51,820
It's fine.

333
00:17:51,980 --> 00:17:52,700
I can manage.

334
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:04,570
Son.

335
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:07,560
Why are you back so early?

336
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,370
My company let us leave early.

337
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,400
Why didn't your company

338
00:18:11,430 --> 00:18:12,710
send any gifts this year?

339
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:13,900
They did.

340
00:18:14,410 --> 00:18:15,490
Isn't everything here?

341
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:17,460
I'm not talking about these.

342
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,320
Doesn't your company give you

343
00:18:19,350 --> 00:18:20,450
something extra every year?

344
00:18:21,460 --> 00:18:22,830
The smoked meat.

345
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:24,580
The stuff I said was delicious last year.
