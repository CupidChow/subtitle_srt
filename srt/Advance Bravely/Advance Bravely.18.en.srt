00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,570
I'm Wang Shuang.

00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:23,980
This is my phone number.

8
00:02:24,070 --> 00:02:25,110
Hope you can save it.

9
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:43,300
What a liar.

10
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:45,420
He said he didn't know her.

11
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:47,829
He obviously spoke to her before.

12
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:50,110
What a hypocrite!

13
00:03:05,290 --> 00:03:05,990
Your phone is ringing.

14
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:14,860
Hello?

15
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,370
What kind of secret talk is that?

16
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:24,720
Why did he have to hide from me when answering the phone?

17
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:13,730
Naughty.

18
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,480
The soup you made

19
00:05:02,590 --> 00:05:03,830
is so salty.

20
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,180
Don't you think you add way too much salt?

21
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,430
Why are you laughing?

22
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:14,270
You didn't focus on your cooking.

23
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:15,390
And you got a phone call while cooking.

24
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:16,310
Look what you have made.

25
00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:17,020
What kind of food is this?

26
00:05:17,340 --> 00:05:17,860
Huh?

27
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:18,790
Do you think this soup is edible?

28
00:05:42,950 --> 00:05:44,390
Why isn't it salty now?

29
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,140
It smells like it's burned.

30
00:05:57,130 --> 00:05:57,990
Where's the boat?

31
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,520
Why is she so annoying?

32
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:26,170
It's your call again.

while dedicated departments

40
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,620
handle other facets of our business.

00:06:54,570 --> 00:06:56,420

00:07:08,490 --> 00:07:09,830

This is the promotional material

46
00:07:56,470 --> 00:07:57,400
for the program that I mentioned last time.

47
00:07:57,420 --> 00:07:58,620
I've brought it with me this time.

48
00:07:58,650 --> 00:07:59,270
Take a look,

49
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:00,640
and then we can discuss it in detail.

50
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,070
Please go on.

51
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,060
I'm just here to surf the internet.

52
00:08:08,780 --> 00:08:09,510
Look.

53
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:11,140
This is a business talk show.

54
00:08:11,300 --> 00:08:12,700
Although it's not that popular,

55
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:14,880
it still has a high viewership

56
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,220
and holds a significant position in the industry.

57
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,580
Many renowned estate developers

58
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,830
have appeared on this program.

59
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:20,690
So,

60
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:21,740
I've brought some materials,

61
00:08:21,770 --> 00:08:22,680
and you can take a look.

62
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,230
Give me a copy too.

63
00:08:28,650 --> 00:08:30,090
Isn't it just an immature financial channel

64
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,049
on a portal website?

65
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,340
Why does she have to make such a fuss about it?

66
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:36,470
Our company has even been on

67
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:37,840
well-known radio interview programs.

68
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,289
Do we really need to promote ourselves

69
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,510
in the place you're recommending?

70
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,330
Come up with something better if you want to meet him.

71
00:08:44,220 --> 00:08:45,240
I've seen this program.

72
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:46,220
My friend recommended it to me.

73
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,200
It's pretty good.

74
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:48,320
Look over here.

75
00:08:48,430 --> 00:08:49,700
These are details about past interviews.

-This is the famous real estate developer.

78
00:08:52,170 --> 00:08:53,010
And this...

79
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:53,880
I mean,

80
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,030
this program doesn't have enough popularity.

81
00:08:57,290 --> 00:08:58,540
Besides, this program features insights from various entrepreneurs

82
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:00,280
on the current economic situation.

83
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,260
The program's promotional reach for businesses is quite limited!

84
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:04,060
I believe

85
00:09:04,060 --> 00:09:06,310
the website's viewership will gradually increase over time

86
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:08,300
and could benefit from the influence of celebrities

87
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:09,430
to achieve a win-win situation.

88
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:11,630
As for the content of their interviews that you mentioned,

89
00:09:11,660 --> 00:09:13,190
I think it's somewhat irrelevant.

90
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:14,300
Moreover,

91
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,970
this is about promoting our company culture.

92
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,850
At the very least, some promotion is better than none, right?

93
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,500
That's just a waste of time.

94
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:20,870
But...

95
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,080
I'll need to check my upcoming schedule.

96
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:23,950
If there are no other promotional events,

97
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:25,160
I can consider it.

98
00:09:27,420 --> 00:09:28,480
It's time for you to leave.

99
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:30,900
Right.

100
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,460
Yuan Ru just called me.

101
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,460
She kept praising me.

102
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,380
She said that if I didn't insist on

103
00:09:35,380 --> 00:09:36,350
pestering you,

104
00:09:36,350 --> 00:09:37,470
she'd be wasting away at home.

105
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,390
Is the company about to

106
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,380
recruit new trainees?

107
00:09:39,910 --> 00:09:40,380
Yeah.

108
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:41,300
The recruitment starts on

109
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:41,980
the fifteenth of next month.

110
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:42,570
Well,

111
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:43,740
I even told her

112
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,020
it wasn't my credit.

113
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:46,700
It's because you just adore your sister too much.

114
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,940
You can't bear to leave her at home...

115
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,990
I heard that the Black Panther Special Forces

116
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:50,250
use special leather boots.

117
00:09:50,460 --> 00:09:51,940
Those boots are layered with metal on the outside.

118
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,820
During combat,

119
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:54,260
they can take out a dozen people with a single kick.

120
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:55,620
I heard about that too.

121
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:57,300
They even use gloves that can snatch knives.

122
00:09:57,500 --> 00:09:58,910
I'm planning to order a batch for us.

123
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:00,020
I mean, sis,

124
00:10:00,210 --> 00:10:01,470
get the hint already!

125
00:10:01,490 --> 00:10:02,260
Well,

126
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:04,230
do you know where Yuan Ru went today?

127
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:05,800
She went to the market.

128
00:10:06,130 --> 00:10:07,770
She said she wanted to cook you a delicious meal.

129
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,710
I heard from Yuan Ru...

130
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:09,170
Thanks.

131
00:10:10,180 --> 00:10:11,890
that you're very good at cooking.

132
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:16,780
Thank you.

133
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:29,440
Well, then,

134
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:31,460
please look through these documents

135
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,580
and consider taking on the advertisement.

136
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:42,230
What a nice trench coat.

137
00:10:42,260 --> 00:10:43,700
It looks good on you.

138
00:10:46,970 --> 00:10:48,180
I bought that for him!

139
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:02,510
Do you think the program accepts just anyone?

140
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:04,300
Do you think you can arrange things as you please?

141
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:06,180
You said you did it out of goodwill,

142
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,820
but shouldn't you have informed me beforehand?

143
00:11:08,540 --> 00:11:09,560
I just...

144
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:11,910
agreed in the spur of the moment.

145
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:12,860
Here's your coffee.

146
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,080
Thanks.

147
00:11:14,970 --> 00:11:16,080
If you can't stand the pressure,

148
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,710
you should give up.

149
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,740
I already said yes.

150
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:21,030
You know

151
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,180
how much I love appearing impressive.

152
00:11:24,990 --> 00:11:25,870
I did my research.

153
00:11:26,110 --> 00:11:28,340
That company is pretty well-known.

154
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:30,070
Isn't this a chance to promote the program?

155
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:33,060
Fame brings complications, get it?

156
00:11:33,690 --> 00:11:34,930
Do you think your wishes

157
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:36,510
will come true with a snap?

158
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,830
Are you aware of

159
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,990
the countless sensitive issues and complex procedures involved?

160
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,250
Our reporters hustle all day long

161
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:43,590
for a rare interview.

162
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:46,070
Are we supposed to delay everything just for you?

163
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,950
But...

164
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:49,980
I was afraid that this opportunity

165
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,310
would be wasted if there were delays.

166
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:53,100
Please.

167
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:53,980
You see.

168
00:11:54,270 --> 00:11:56,020
When is the earliest slot available?

169
00:11:58,870 --> 00:11:59,710
After the New Year.

170
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:01,740
After the New Year?

171
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:04,060
That would be so late.

172
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:06,290
It's already the end of December.

173
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:07,980
The schedule for the start of the year is packed.

174
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:09,910
I'm already doing you a favor by saying after the New Year.

175
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:12,350
Please!

176
00:12:12,380 --> 00:12:13,590
Please.

177
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:14,700
I'm begging you!

178
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,020
There's no use begging.

179
00:12:16,020 --> 00:12:17,100
I can't ruin my work

180
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:18,230
for your love life.

181
00:12:18,350 --> 00:12:19,180
Besides,

182
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,710
what's so great about that guy?

183
00:12:20,710 --> 00:12:22,180
Why are you doing so much for him?

184
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:24,950
How about this?

185
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,830
Send two people over.

186
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:29,050
It's just to reassure them.

187
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,810
I also don't want to embarrass myself.

188
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,420
Do me that favor.

189
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:34,700
Okay?

190
00:12:34,700 --> 00:12:35,670
Please!

191
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,620
Next week,

192
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:43,160
I'll send two reporters over.

193
00:12:44,620 --> 00:12:46,060
You're the best.

194
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,510
I really can't say no to you.

195
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:16,970
What are you doing?

196
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:20,820
Meditating to improve myself.

197
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,400
Improve yourself?

198
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,590
You're already so outstanding.

199
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:24,780
There's no need to do that.

200
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,150
Am I outstanding?

201
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:30,130
Right now,

202
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,890
do I look indifferent?

203
00:13:32,060 --> 00:13:32,780
Of course.

204
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,620
Haven't you always been like that?

205
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:38,420
Yeah.

206
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:40,030
I'm aloof.

207
00:13:40,670 --> 00:13:42,530
I have always been like this.

208
00:13:57,690 --> 00:13:59,240
You just need to close the browser.

209
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:00,980
Why are you so troubled?

210
00:14:03,110 --> 00:14:04,260
Here, all done.

211
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:09,750
Hey.

212
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:10,670
Where are you going?

213
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,740
Call me if there's anything urgent.

214
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:13,740
Okay.

215
00:14:40,310 --> 00:14:40,950
Mr. Xia.

216
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:43,270
Long time no see.

217
00:14:43,470 --> 00:14:44,500
What brings you here?

218
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:45,990
Can you do me a favor?

219
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,910
What is it?

220
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:50,620
Can you advertise my friend's company?

221
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,240
What kind of company is it?

222
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,490
A bodyguard company.

223
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:56,030
A bodyguard company sounds great.

224
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:57,560
We have never launched educational programs

225
00:14:57,580 --> 00:14:58,750
on security and safety.

226
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,330
We can give it a shot.

227
00:15:01,460 --> 00:15:03,170
What is the ideal schedule for you?

228
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:06,250
How about winter break?

229
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:08,150
That's when viewership peaks and advertising is ideal.

230
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:09,190
hat's when viewership peaks and advertising is ideal.

231
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:10,670
Okay then,

232
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:11,490
winter break it is.

233
00:15:11,740 --> 00:15:12,270
I'll bring someone

234
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:13,420
there tomorrow.

235
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:13,980
Thank you.

236
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,020
You don't have to be polite with me.

237
00:15:17,260 --> 00:15:18,100
It's settled then.

238
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,820
You have to remember three types of "always."

239
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:29,860
One.

240
00:15:30,430 --> 00:15:31,870
Always be with your client.

241
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,990
Once you leave them,

242
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,870
danger will be upon them at any moment.

243
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,590
Your enemy will always ambush you from behind.

244
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:40,100
When we lower

245
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,220
our guard,

246
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:43,690
danger will be upon us.

247
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:44,980
Two,

248
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,500
always take good care of your client.

249
00:15:47,060 --> 00:15:47,870
In China,

250
00:15:47,870 --> 00:15:48,870
danger isn't rampant.

251
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,700
How can we raise the value

252
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:51,780
of the security services?

253
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:54,480
We have to be attentive to our clients.

254
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,070
We have to act as their assistants,

255
00:15:56,070 --> 00:15:56,740
secretaries,

256
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,910
and chauffeurs.

257
00:15:58,020 --> 00:15:58,590
Three.

258
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:00,230
Always analyze your enemy.

259
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:01,310
Assess the risks

260
00:16:01,780 --> 00:16:02,620
and develop strategies.

261
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,750
Be prepared for emergencies.

262
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,780
No matter how frequent and mundane

263
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:09,420
our work may be,

264
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:12,300
no matter how mechanized it becomes,

265
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:14,780
we must always be prepared for the arrival of danger.

[Yunhai Television]

267
00:16:15,790 --> 00:16:16,850
Doubt every single person you meet.

268
00:16:17,090 --> 00:16:18,190
Treat them as potential enemies.

269
00:16:18,950 --> 00:16:20,900
Be ever-ready to act as a shield.

270
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,860
Be prepared to clear the scene.

271
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:26,780
Continue the training.

272

Nice to meet you, Mr. Yuan.

We're reporters from Yunhai Television.

274

Did the people I invited arrive ahead of schedule?

275
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,780
We would like to invite your company to join a program.

276
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,870
Do you have time for a chat?

277

Sure.

Please come this way.

This isn't right.

Get out of my way.

Mr. Yuan,

291
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,550
could you please introduce

00:17:00,550 --> 00:17:01,580
your venue to us?

293
00:17:01,580 --> 00:17:02,270
Sure.

Is Xia Yao around?

Can you help me get him?
