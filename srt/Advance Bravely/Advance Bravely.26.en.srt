I want to

00:02:19,940 --> 00:02:21,940
keep this from my mom for now.

7
00:02:22,570 --> 00:02:23,360
Your injuries are severe.

8
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,070
Is it possible to keep her in the dark?

9
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,310
A few days should be fine.

10
00:02:27,350 --> 00:02:28,120
I'll tell her

11
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:30,090
that I'm suddenly asked to work overtime.

12

I'll ask my colleagues to play along, too.

When my injury begins to heal,

14
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,579
I'll let her know.

15

Otherwise,

I'm afraid she'll collapse.

Did you have to fight with him?

If you had fled,

23
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:52,700
would this have happened?

24
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,640
He couldn't beat me.

25

26

Who knew he would pull such dirty tricks?

27
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,930
He even hurled powder to my face.

28

If he weren't so devoted to helping me,

help me

195
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,300
wash my dirty clothes.

196
00:09:30,590 --> 00:09:30,990
Okay.

197
00:09:34,670 --> 00:09:35,510
Just these?

198
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:36,030
Yes.

199
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:36,920
Just these.

200
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:39,890
Have a seat, Dayu.

201
00:09:53,090 --> 00:09:54,620
Didn't you want to break with me?

202
00:09:55,710 --> 00:09:57,010
Don't you find me unbearable?

203
00:09:57,710 --> 00:09:58,600
Why are you here?

204
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:06,730
I'm here just to see the retribution you got.

205
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:10,110
Someone was even upset.

206
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,110
She asked me not to talk about your swollen eye.

207
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,430
Your eyes

208
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:14,970
are already mismatched.

209
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:16,180
Why are you scared of being mentioned?

210
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,360
Besides your uneven eyes,

211
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:26,450
your face is bruised black and blue,

212
00:10:26,700 --> 00:10:27,800
just like freckles.

213
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,310
Your nose is swollen too.

214
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,410
Even your philtrum looks shorter.

215
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:35,740
Your cheeks are uneven.

216
00:10:36,530 --> 00:10:38,120
Do you want to laugh at something even more ridiculous?

217
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:38,860
Sure.

218
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:39,810
Why not?

219
00:10:48,610 --> 00:10:49,060
What...

220
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:50,640
What is this?

221
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,570
I got injured while sending this to you.

222
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:54,670
You...

223
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,980
Why did you send this to me?

224
00:10:56,430 --> 00:10:57,020
To paper a wall.

225
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:58,550
What can it be for?

226
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:00,710
To lift some guy's mood.

227
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,530
He said that I neglected him

228
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,650
and my attitude towards him was bad.

229
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,030
I skipped my lunch

230
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:09,460
to buy skincare products for him.

231
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,420
As soon as I got off work in the evening, I rushed to deliver this to him.

232
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:15,470
Finally, my car broke down.

233
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,280
Forget it.

234
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:19,510
Don't mention it.

235
00:11:20,090 --> 00:11:21,020
It's not worth my concern.

236
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,350
Aren't you here to laugh at me?

237
00:11:32,620 --> 00:11:33,600
Why aren't you laughing?

238
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:38,420
Yao.

239
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:39,470
Listen to me.

240
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:40,500
I'm always...

241
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:41,220
Save it.

242
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,950
I know you like the palm of my hand.

243
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:47,050
You only appear gracious.

244
00:11:47,530 --> 00:11:49,230
In fact, you're just like an old lady at the market.

245
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:51,620
You're stingy about just a few cents.

246
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,100
Am I wrong?

247
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:02,590
You said that I kept secrets.

248
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:04,550
I just called you several days ago

249
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:05,830
to beg and coax you.

250
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:07,250
Some jerk ignored me.

251
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:09,860
You said that I'm whiny.

252
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,600
You're just the same.

253
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:12,440
Ah.

254
00:12:16,870 --> 00:12:17,340
Okay.

255
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,890
You're a patient.

256
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:19,610
You call the shots.

257
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:21,140
You're always right.

258
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:21,940
Well.

259
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,430
This.

260
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:31,640
Thanks.

261
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:44,330
Why are you standing there?

262
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,280
Sit down.

263
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,620
I'm punishing myself, all right?

264
00:13:08,860 --> 00:13:10,220
You two, be careful!

265
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,050
Hey, Brother.

266
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:20,600
Take a smoke.

267
00:13:29,500 --> 00:13:31,320
Blackie is probably crippled.

268
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:32,280
Why keep him around?

269
00:13:35,150 --> 00:13:36,280
Blackie is such an idiot.

270
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:38,570
He even dares beat up Xia Weidong's grandson.

271
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,820
He must be eager to head to his grave.

272
00:13:43,410 --> 00:13:44,490
Have you seen Xia Yao before?

273
00:13:44,940 --> 00:13:47,270
Isn't he the one in the newspapers back then?

274
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,880
That picture was processed.

275
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:51,820
Have you seen him in person?

276
00:13:52,170 --> 00:13:53,520
Their company once came here

277
00:13:53,540 --> 00:13:54,910
for an event.

278
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,240
He was present.

279
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,050
I didn't take a good look.

280
00:13:58,510 --> 00:14:00,060
I only took a glance from afar.

281
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,920
You will know if you look closer next time.

282
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,190
Is he that handsome?

283
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:09,580
Doesn't he join the kickboxing competition every year?

284
00:14:10,590 --> 00:14:11,730
I'm an avid fan.

285
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,040
Brother,

286
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:13,780
we're done loading the van.

287
00:14:14,620 --> 00:14:15,540
I have never lost a single round.

288
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:17,250
Get on.

289
00:16:21,210 --> 00:16:22,040
Fire!

290
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,100
Save people!

291
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,060
Hello!

292
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:29,730
Send a vehicle here

293
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,720
to clear the scene.
