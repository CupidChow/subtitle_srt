Pull!

Harder!

Harder!

00:03:01,700 --> 00:03:02,250
Pull harder!

12
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,070
Why is there only one of them?

13
00:03:19,930 --> 00:03:20,820
Where's that lad?

14
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:22,020
Is he still down there?

15
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:23,180
Of course! He must be down there.

16
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:24,450
Lower the rope!

17
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,060
Hurry up!

18
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:04,460
Lower the rope.

00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,030

The jacket, that jacket!

23

Phone.

24
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:13,300
Quickly, call someone.

Hang on!

26
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:23,210
Hello?

27

Hello?

28
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:25,880
Are you friends with this phone's owner?

29
00:04:26,330 --> 00:04:27,460
Yes, what's up?

30
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,200
Your friend just came to help us,

31
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:30,110
but he ended up fell into the well,

32
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:30,970
and hasn't been rescued yet.

33
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,010
If you happen to be nearby,

34
00:04:32,030 --> 00:04:33,030
just come over quickly.

36
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:16,180
Hey!

Can you hear me?

38
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,530
Dude, are you okay?

39
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,100
If you can hear us, please say something.

40
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,730
Yao! Yao! Yao!

41
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:41,330
Hurry.

42
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,380
Tie me up, I can go down.

43
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,150
You wanna go down as well?

44
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:44,170

48
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,159

49
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,390
Slow down.

51
00:06:01,980 --> 00:06:03,020
Be careful.

52
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:03,730
Take it easy!

53
00:06:06,890 --> 00:06:07,470

00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,630

55
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:09,770
I'm coming for you.

56
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:10,640
Watch out!

57
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:14,450
Be careful.

58
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:15,290
Hurry up!

59
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:21,900

60
00:06:32,740 --> 00:06:33,500
I'm here.

61
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:35,810
Hang on.

62
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,780
Yao.

63
00:06:50,740 --> 00:06:51,460
Yao, are you alright?

64
00:06:52,159 --> 00:06:52,790
I'm fine.

65
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,340
I got you finally.

66
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,320
Big dumpling.

67
00:06:58,140 --> 00:06:59,510
I'm freezing.

68
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,560
Hang on a little longer.

69
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,580
We're going up.

70
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,690
I'll go up with you.

71
00:07:16,730 --> 00:07:17,210
No.

72
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:18,590
That would too heavy, if both of us go up at the same time.

73
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:19,760
You should go up first.

74
00:07:20,250 --> 00:07:21,570
And I can climb up myself later.

75
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,890
By the time you're at the top of the well,

76
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,530
I'll have climbed there too.

77
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:25,880
I don't believe you.

78
00:07:26,170 --> 00:07:27,370
The wall of this well is so slippery.

79
00:07:28,190 --> 00:07:29,560
How can you be able to climb up?

80
00:07:37,870 --> 00:07:38,600
Yuan Zong.

81
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:44,380
Yuan Zong.

82
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:47,550
Yuan Zong!

83
00:07:48,150 --> 00:07:48,750
I'm here!

84
00:07:51,940 --> 00:07:53,740
Yuan Zong, are you still there?

85
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:55,070
Yeah.

86
00:07:58,450 --> 00:07:59,460
Big dumpling!

87
00:08:00,710 --> 00:08:03,510
Why is your voice getting farther away?

88
00:08:05,020 --> 00:08:06,150
Big dumpling!

89
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:13,590
Why did the rope snap?

90
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:14,490
How would I know?

91
00:08:15,010 --> 00:08:15,960
Find another one, quickly!

92
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,420
We only have one rope here.

93
00:08:21,020 --> 00:08:22,120
Are you guys okay?

94
00:08:22,330 --> 00:08:23,610
Can you hear us?

95
00:08:23,630 --> 00:08:24,530
I told you,

96
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:25,890
if you hadn't struggled,

97
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,230
both of us would be up there by now.

98
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:30,850
The rope snapped by itself.

99
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:32,090
It's not my fault.

100
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:34,539
What are you doing?

101
00:08:35,659 --> 00:08:37,340
I heard the sound of the rope falling down.

102
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,230
Try to grab it.

103
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:40,260
Let's see if we can reach it.

104
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,020
I can't reach it.

105
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:49,140
Stand on my shoulder then.

106
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:50,520
Try it again.

107
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:15,080
Big dumpling.

108
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,970
Are you alright?

109
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:18,770
I can handle it.

110
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:20,580
Keep looking.

111
00:09:28,820 --> 00:09:29,980
Put me down.

112
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:31,580
Put me down.

113
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,240
Don't move!

114
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:33,780
Just stay put.

115
00:09:34,110 --> 00:09:36,350
You can't stand the weight of us.

116
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:37,740
Put me down.

117
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,130
I'm begging you.

118
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,420
Please put me down, hurry!

119
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:07,520
Can someone help him?

120
00:10:12,080 --> 00:10:12,680
Hurry up!

121
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:14,030
If you can hear us, please say something!

122
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:18,480
Instructor! Instructor! Instructor!

123
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:20,070
Instructor! Chief Instructor!

124
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:20,890
Can you hear us?

125
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:21,980
Don't panic.

126
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,400
We'll get you out immediately!

127
00:10:23,940 --> 00:10:25,530
Save Yuan Zong first.

128
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:26,620
Instructor, don't panic.

129
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,780
We'll lower the rope down right away.

130
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,670
Get the rope ready.

131
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:30,340
And the plank.

132
00:10:30,370 --> 00:10:31,020
Get the rope over here, hurry.

133
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:31,340
The plank.

134
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:32,020
Get the rope.

135
00:10:32,020 --> 00:10:32,620
The rope.

136
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,060
Get the plank.

137
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:34,820
The rope.

138
00:10:34,970 --> 00:10:35,780
Here, it's here.

139
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:36,570
The rope.

140
00:10:36,980 --> 00:10:37,540
Come on.

141
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,210
Give me the rope.

142
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:38,770
The rope.

143
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:39,410
Hurry up.

144
00:10:39,410 --> 00:10:40,060
Quickly!

145
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:40,580
Lower it down.

146
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:41,470
Lower the rope.

147
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:42,020
Lower it!

148
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:43,460
-Instructor! -Instructor!

149
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:44,360
Hold the rope.

150
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:45,430
Hurry up. Hang on.

151
00:10:45,650 --> 00:10:47,600
Save him up first.

152
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:48,500
-Instructor. -Instructor!

153
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:50,500
Take the rope and hang on.

154
00:11:32,990 --> 00:11:33,630
Yuan Ru.

155
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:36,800
Yuan Ru.

156
00:11:37,550 --> 00:11:38,500
Yuan Ru.

157
00:11:38,530 --> 00:11:39,280
Brother, you're awake!

158
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:41,180
Come over.

159
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:42,780
I have something to say to you.

160
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,760
I'll go get you some water.

161
00:11:48,940 --> 00:11:49,980
Don't tell him about his injured toes

162
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,620
when your brother is awake.

163
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,110
I'm afraid that he can't handle the truth.

164
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,440
No way.

165
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:00,020
My brother has been injured countless times in his life.

166
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:02,110
He's used to it.

167
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:04,520
How can other injuries be compared to this?

168
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,850
This is close to a disability.

169
00:12:09,390 --> 00:12:11,300
But he's bound to find out.

170
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:13,730
Oh, thank you, aunt.

171
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:14,940
How about this?

172
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:17,420
We can take the time and slowly reveal it to him.

173
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:19,580
By that, he'll have time to process this.

174
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:22,210
I'm just afraid that once he wakes up

175
00:12:22,380 --> 00:12:23,880
and sees his own state,

176
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:26,100
he'll be traumatized.

177
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,680
I get it.

178
00:12:32,330 --> 00:12:32,930
Brother.

179
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:34,130
You're awake.

180
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,180
Brother.

181
00:12:35,950 --> 00:12:38,200
Bother, you're finally awake.

182
00:12:44,220 --> 00:12:44,910
Brother.

183
00:12:46,610 --> 00:12:47,340
Why are you crying?

184
00:12:47,710 --> 00:12:48,670
I'm doing fine.

185
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:50,610
What are you talking about?

186
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,500
You lost your toes.

187
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:56,780
It's okay.

188
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:57,960
But...

189
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:00,770
toes are necessary for balance.

190
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,050
Even if I lose a leg,

191
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,530
my balance will still be perfect.

192
00:13:08,690 --> 00:13:09,970
In the past,

193
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:11,690
people used to

194
00:13:11,710 --> 00:13:12,850
bind their feet so tightly,

195
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,230
and they still could walk, right?

196
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:16,330
Now that you've lost your toes,

197
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,880
what will you pick at when you're bored?

198
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,780
My happiness

199
00:13:21,070 --> 00:13:22,990
doesn't really depend on that.

200
00:13:23,850 --> 00:13:24,610
I heard that

201
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,230
there's a technique

202
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:28,190
where they put the severed toes

203
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,610
in their belly to heal,

204
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,860
and then reattach them.

205
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,730
How about

206
00:13:34,330 --> 00:13:35,660
you put that severed piece

207
00:13:35,940 --> 00:13:37,150
in my belly?

208
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,520
Once it's better,

209
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,060
I can give birth to it for you.

210
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:40,980
Xia Yao.

211
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:42,460
Enough with your nonsense.

212
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:46,220
Now,

213
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,150
there's a technology called skeletal reconstruction,

214
00:13:48,370 --> 00:13:50,690
which means it can repair damaged limbs

215
00:13:51,310 --> 00:13:53,010
by restoring your capillaries,

216
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,640
muscle fibers and tissues.

217
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:57,490
This can bring your damaged limb back to

218
00:13:57,530 --> 00:13:58,890
its normal functionality.

219
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:01,350
I've already contacted doctors in the U.S.

220
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,660
Once things settle down at the end of the year,

221
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:04,380
I'll take you there for the treatment.

222
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:06,240
Sorry for the trouble.

223
00:14:06,580 --> 00:14:07,020
Alas,

224
00:14:07,470 --> 00:14:09,350
you saved Xia Yao's life. It's no trouble at all.

225
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,460
Why would I be bothered

226
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:11,640
by something so trivial?

227
00:14:11,990 --> 00:14:13,280
It's no trouble at all.

228
00:14:13,780 --> 00:14:14,860
Thank you, ma'am.

229
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,670
Okay.
