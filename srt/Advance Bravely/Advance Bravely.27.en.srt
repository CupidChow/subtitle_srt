[Episode 27]

4
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,380
What do you think about this girl?

5
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:12,180
She's pretty.

6
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:13,850
Nonsense!

7
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,360
What's wrong with your aesthetic?

8
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:16,350
I mean...

9
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:17,710
how could you call her pretty?

10
00:02:17,780 --> 00:02:18,579
Look at her face.

11
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,060
I bet she had plastic surgery!

12
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:21,570
So?

13
00:02:22,850 --> 00:02:25,180
And she's dating Yao.

14
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:29,290
What are you laughing at?

15
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:33,329
Didn't I give you money

16
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:34,370
to get rid of this scar?

17
00:02:35,060 --> 00:02:36,020
Why do you still look like this?

18
00:02:37,070 --> 00:02:38,550
Why did you call me over?

19
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:40,079
Am I just supposed to look at this woman's photo?

20
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:43,480
I'm just afraid that Yao might be taken advantage of.

21
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,710
This girl looks like a gold-digger.

22
00:02:46,450 --> 00:02:47,810
I'm afraid that she's playing tricks on him.

23
00:02:52,070 --> 00:02:53,079
That's why I called you over

24
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:54,380
and wanted to ask you to be a spy for me.

25
00:02:55,810 --> 00:02:57,560
Your job is to keep an eye on her 7/24.

26
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:58,800
If this girl does

27
00:02:58,829 --> 00:02:59,730
anything improper,

28
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,030
just let me know immediately.

29
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:02,430
You don't have to work now,

30
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,430
I'll pay you ten times your wage.

31
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,920
How about that?

32
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,170
Sounds fair. Who wouldn't want to do this

33
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,040
easy and profitable job?

34
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,380
I mean...

35
00:03:13,600 --> 00:03:14,130
Wait a minute.

36
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,450
This is an advance payment.

37
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:19,140
First, get rid of that

38
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,010
disgusting scar on your forehead.

39
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:22,490
Yes, sir!

40
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:32,329
Why am I growing fond of him?

41
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:40,350
Yuan Ru!

42
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:41,250
You bitch!

43
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,210
Could it be that

44
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,100
I have set too high expectations for this relationship?

45
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:53,140
Am I so stressed out

46
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:54,760
that I'm hearing things?

47
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,020
Yuan Ru!

48
00:03:56,170 --> 00:03:58,110
You cheating slut!

49
00:03:58,310 --> 00:04:00,410
You already have a partner! Why do you want more?

50
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:05,240
Who is this bastard with a foul mouth?

51
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:07,190
Who is it?

52
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:08,560
Show yourself like a man!

53
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:16,050
It's fine.

54
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,070
Some people are just stupid.

55
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,820
Just ignore him. Let's go.

56
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,180
You're clearly dating Xia Yao!

57
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,820
Why are you seducing other men?

58
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,100
How can you betray Xia Yao?

59
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,470
Xia Yao?

60
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,220
Our acting officer?

61
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:28,890
Dude!

62
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:30,360
I thought you were  a nice man,

63
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,690
that's why I'm here to give you a little reminder!

64
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:33,460
This girl is up to no good.

65
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,220
She was lovely-dovey with Xia Yao a few days ago,

66
00:04:36,370 --> 00:04:37,750
and now she's with you.

67
00:04:39,570 --> 00:04:41,140
If I really had the chance to be with Xia Yao,

68
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:42,770
I'd happily accept your accusation.

69
00:04:42,770 --> 00:04:44,260
But since when did I hook up with Xia Yao?

70
00:04:44,470 --> 00:04:45,500
Show yourself, darn it!

71
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:46,490
Talk to me face to face!

72
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:47,950
Xia Yao told me himself.

73
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:49,260
I'm his buddy.

74
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,090
I just don't like the way you treat Xia Yao,

75
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,760
so I'm here to help out this poor guy.

76
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:57,950
I'm getting impatient!

77
00:04:59,400 --> 00:04:59,980
Bastard!

78
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:01,350
Get over here! Show yourself!

79
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:03,020
Why are you hiding? Such a coward!

80
00:05:08,580 --> 00:05:09,420
Bastard!

81
00:05:09,570 --> 00:05:10,720
Come on, show yourself.

82
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,770
Where the heck are you?

83
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:14,380
I'm gonna beat the heck out of you!

84
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:16,110
Where the heck are you?

85
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:27,910
This one is delicious.

86
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:30,940
Have one.

87
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,670
You just had a surgery.

88
00:05:33,250 --> 00:05:34,159
You need more proteins.

89
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:35,790
It's good for your health and recovery.

90
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:38,620
Here.

00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,130
[Yuan Ru]

92
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:50,330
Hello?

93
00:05:50,659 --> 00:05:51,390
Brother!

94
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:52,490
Come here.

95
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,600
Some weird guy is harassing me!

96
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,870
-He even threw eggs on me! -Stop right there!

97
00:05:58,080 --> 00:05:58,590
Hurry up!

98
00:05:58,700 --> 00:05:59,570
I found him!

99
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:03,860
You should keep eating.

100
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:04,580
I gotta go and check out my sister.

101
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:06,230
I'll come with you.

102
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,060
Is your kidney deficiency

103
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,280
slowing you down?

104
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,040
Brother!

105
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,360
What happened?

106
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,440
Brother.

107
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,180
It's him!

108
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,020
Not again?

109
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,840
Why are you always picking on me?

110
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:03,710
Wait,

111
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,890
why are you two together again?

112
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:06,850
Let's put this thing aside.

113
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:07,760
Let me tell you,

114
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,410
this girl is trash.

115
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,470
She's dating someone else behind your back.

116
00:07:13,030 --> 00:07:13,840
Behind his back?

117
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:15,460
I'm not even dating him!

118
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,170
How can I be cheating?

119
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:18,210
Even if you two are not dating,

120
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,190
it still feels like it.

121
00:07:21,370 --> 00:07:22,250
Feels like it? What do you mean?

122
00:07:22,650 --> 00:07:24,020
Not even a chance!

123
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,240
Enough.

124
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,030
Are you alright?

125
00:07:34,570 --> 00:07:35,520
Should we take him to the hospital?

126
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:37,159
Piss off.

127
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:44,820
Brother.

128
00:08:07,890 --> 00:08:09,430
Didn't you drive here?

129
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:12,700
I was in a rush getting off.

130
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,410
So I parked my car by the curb.

131
00:08:15,300 --> 00:08:16,670
It's probably been towed away by now.

132
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,320
Were you very moved just now?

133
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,250
Were you touched?

134
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:24,440
Do you need to go to the hospital or not?

135
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:26,740
It hurts.

136
00:08:27,170 --> 00:08:27,670
Are you alright?

137
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:28,960
I'm fine.

138
00:08:29,110 --> 00:08:30,310
Why did you push yourself?

139
00:08:31,570 --> 00:08:32,890
I didn't think that much at the moment.

140
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:34,760
I don't need your protection.

141
00:09:09,570 --> 00:09:10,500
Sir! Come over.

142
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:11,540

144

Help us.

Sir, come over please.

146
00:09:18,780 --> 00:09:20,660
Sir, come and help us.

147
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,660
We can't make it over there.

148
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:24,150
Sir, please help us.

149
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,100
Come here quickly.

Hey.

167
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,330
Why do you keep changing the location?

168
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:50,670
I wasted so much time looking for you.

169
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,300
I'm delivering parcels.

170
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:53,650
Why are you running around?

171
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:55,510
Didn't the doctor tell you to stay put?

172
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,270
Come with me.

173
00:10:57,600 --> 00:10:59,130
I still have quite a number of parcels left.

174
00:10:59,240 --> 00:11:00,210
Can't you do that tomorrow?

175
00:11:00,750 --> 00:11:01,510
No, no.

176
00:11:01,530 --> 00:11:02,590
People are waiting for their parcels.

177
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:06,040
Just put them in my car.

178
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:06,640
My car is faster.

179
00:11:07,030 --> 00:11:07,790
No, no...

180
00:11:08,450 --> 00:11:09,250
What's wrong?

181
00:11:09,490 --> 00:11:10,770
What about my bike?

182
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,100
Just leave it here.

183
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,220
You can get it after seeing the doctor.

184
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:14,350
No one is gonna steal your shabby bike.

185
00:12:07,790 --> 00:12:09,540
I mean, I've paid you quite a lot.

I thought you're no longer in a difficult situation.

187
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,920
But why are you

188
00:12:13,950 --> 00:12:14,910
working your ass off day and night?

189
00:12:16,220 --> 00:12:18,530
Fortune is not the excuse for laziness.

190
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,410

00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:21,680
none of them are slacking, right?

192
00:12:22,210 --> 00:12:23,730
Don't try to lecture me.

193
00:12:24,290 --> 00:12:25,690
I'm just asking, where did that money go?

194
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:27,560
I also didn't see you spending it.

195
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:29,880
I'm saving it up.

196
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,430
For what?

197
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:34,680
For dating girls.

I don't care which ward you're in right now.

I'm waiting for you.

204
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,720
How did you know that I'm here?

205
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:54,510
What a coincidence, isn't it?

206
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,150
A friend of mine went to collect his parcel.

207
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:58,540
He told me the deliveryman was in a luxury car.

208
00:13:59,180 --> 00:14:00,340
I was curious, so I went to take a look.

209
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,460
Guess what?

210
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,890
I saw you,

211
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,210
so I followed you here.

212
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:05,280
Is there anything you want to talk to me?

213
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:07,730
Obviously!

214
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:09,230
What's with your attitude?

215
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:10,130
Do you think you can get away

216
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:11,130
after throwing rotten eggs at me?

217
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:12,670
I mean,

218
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:14,920
did you even see me throwing those eggs at you?

219
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:17,260
You didn't, but your friend did.

220
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:18,740
Okay.

221
00:14:18,950 --> 00:14:19,690
He did it.

222
00:14:20,810 --> 00:14:21,490
But now,

223
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,300
he's been hospitalized.

224
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:23,480
Besides,

225
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,320
do you have any proof

226
00:14:25,660 --> 00:14:26,490
that you aren't dating Yao?

227
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:28,420
Xia Yao admitted it himself!

228
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,520
What proof do you need?

229
00:14:30,310 --> 00:14:31,960
He might have said so, but there might be hidden reasons for that.

230
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:33,270
You know what?

231
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:34,770
If you were my girlfriend,

232
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,090
and you cuckolded me in front of my friends,

233
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,130
I would also have refused to admit that we were dating.

234
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,500
Does that make sense to you?

235
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:41,850
Piss off.

236
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:44,040
You two aren't dating?

237

If you aren't,

238
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,260
why is he training at your brother's company?

If you two aren't dating,

240
00:14:48,940 --> 00:14:50,740
why is he slaving for your brother during the new year?

-That's because... -If you aren't dating,

why did he rush to Harbin?

243

Are you still going to deny that you aren't dating?

00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:07,790
when I see him,
