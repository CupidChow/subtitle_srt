I'm not turning back anyway!

10

The chain broke,

26

so I just left it at a repair shop.

Hey, it seems like someone is not good at riding a bike.

28

Let's have a break.

What has Mr. Yuan been busy with lately?

117
00:12:57,560 --> 00:12:58,350
You don't know?

118
00:12:58,890 --> 00:13:00,010
Ms. Yuan has fallen

119
00:13:00,030 --> 00:13:01,620
for another man lately.

120
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,510
He's only 24 years old

121
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:03,420
but very handsome.

122
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:05,510
Oh, no.

123
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,580
Another young man's life is gonna be screwed.

124
00:13:07,670 --> 00:13:08,390
What do you mean?

125
00:13:08,550 --> 00:13:09,500
Haven't you heard?

126
00:13:09,950 --> 00:13:11,470
Every man who catches Yuan Ru's eye

127
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,710
seems to bring misfortune upon himself.

128
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:14,190
Mr. Yuan

129
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,140
used to be a soldier,

130
00:13:15,280 --> 00:13:16,020
so his values

131
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:16,690
are very upright.

132
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:19,130
He can't withstand any flaws.

133
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,530
But Yuan Ru tends to fall for unreliable guys.

134
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,580
To prevent her from getting hurt,

135
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,860
Mr. Yuan has to keep a close eye on her

136
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,090
and whenever he sees any bad signs,

137
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,130
he'll help her get rid of that man.

138
00:13:27,850 --> 00:13:28,680
I'm just wondering,

139
00:13:29,020 --> 00:13:30,860
Mr. Yuan is in his 30s now, right?

140
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,550
Why isn't he worried about himself?

141
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,210
There are so many gorgeous

143
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,420
But he never takes a glance at them

144
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,560
during training.

145
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:40,380
In my opinion,

146
00:13:40,570 --> 00:13:42,130
he's not humane enough.

147
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:45,200
Mind your tongue!

148
00:13:45,830 --> 00:13:46,730
Don't get me wrong.

149
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:48,020
I was just saying,

150
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,540
in my opinion,

151
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,060
Mr. Yuan just has no interests in love.

152
00:13:52,110 --> 00:13:53,460
He's a boy with guns.

153
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:54,500
Like a hero, you know.

154
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:56,760
He doesn't need any romantic relationships.

155
00:14:01,830 --> 00:14:03,280
Brother, do you know

156
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:05,230
that Xia Yao has a grackle?

157
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,780
That bird is so adorable,

158
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,250
just as cute as Xia Yao.

159
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:14,470
Brother.

160
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:15,660
What if I raise the bird

161
00:14:15,690 --> 00:14:16,980
with Xia Yao,

162
00:14:17,190 --> 00:14:20,000
how wonderful and romantic that scene would be?

163
00:14:21,580 --> 00:14:22,310
Cut to the chase.

164
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:25,780
Brother.

165
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,020
Will you help me

166
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,300
deliver this can of feed to Xia Yao?

167
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,510
It's specially formulated by a nutritionist

168
00:14:30,740 --> 00:14:33,130
to make the grackle's voice even clearer.

169
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:37,690
Wow.

170
00:14:37,730 --> 00:14:38,780
That's rare.

171
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,020
I didn't expect he'd accept it so readily.

172
00:14:41,370 --> 00:14:42,930
It seems like he already

173
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,690
sees him as the brother-in-law.

174
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,560
Hello.

175
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:31,700
Hello.

176
00:15:32,100 --> 00:15:32,540
Not leaving.

177
00:15:34,580 --> 00:15:35,000
Not leaving.

178
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:37,960
I'm not leaving.

179
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:39,540

Piss off.

187
00:15:52,170 --> 00:15:54,010
Is it because it has been swearing excessively these days,

188
00:15:54,840 --> 00:15:55,910
leading to overexertion?

00:16:02,150 --> 00:16:02,710
Piss off.

193
00:16:36,800 --> 00:16:37,230
Hey.

194
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:52,800
These are my designs.

195
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:54,220
What a total bullshit!

196
00:16:54,260 --> 00:16:55,310
Use your brains!

197
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,060
If you keep doing things like this,

198
00:16:56,090 --> 00:16:56,740
you should just quit your job.

199
00:16:57,240 --> 00:16:58,120
I promise it won't happen again, Boss.

200
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,930
I won't let it happen again.

201
00:16:59,020 --> 00:16:59,510
Got it.

202
00:17:02,030 --> 00:17:03,250
My friend is getting married tonight,

203
00:17:03,610 --> 00:17:04,640
and I want to go home and get changed.

204
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,000
Sure.

205
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:07,000
You can go home.

206
00:17:22,230 --> 00:17:23,190
Is my grackle

207
00:17:23,569 --> 00:17:24,510
healthy again?

208
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:28,280
Not leaving.

209
00:17:28,569 --> 00:17:29,190
Not leaving.

210
00:17:29,510 --> 00:17:30,270
I'm not leaving.

211
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:31,000
Piss off.

212
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:31,830
Piss off.

213
00:17:32,390 --> 00:17:33,040
Piss off already!

214
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:34,150
Not leaving.

215
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,020
Not leaving.

216
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:36,130
I'm not leaving.

217
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:36,480
Piss off.

218
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,700
Piss off.

219
00:17:37,920 --> 00:17:38,710
Piss off already.

220
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:39,800
Not leaving.

221
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:40,760
Not leaving.

222
00:17:40,900 --> 00:17:41,890
I'm not leaving.

223
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,560
Piss off.

224
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,420
Piss off.

225
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:44,700
Piss off already.

226
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:45,550
Not leaving.

227
00:17:45,610 --> 00:17:46,410
Not leaving.

228
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:47,340
I'm not leaving.

229
00:17:47,340 --> 00:17:47,900
Piss off.

230
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,450
Alright.

231
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:01,690
Your tank top is off your shoulder.

232
00:18:05,300 --> 00:18:05,740
Give it to me.

233
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:06,540
What?

234
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:08,240
Your sister's gift for me.

235
00:18:14,710 --> 00:18:16,910
Now, you have accomplished your mission.

236
00:18:17,740 --> 00:18:19,480
Don't appear before me ever again.

237
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:21,580
Just leave me alone and go somewhere else.

238
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:31,800
I'll just take a look before throwing it away.

239
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:33,660
That will make up for these few days of annoyance.
