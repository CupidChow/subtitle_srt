[Episode 13]

4
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,520
All right, another doubled game.

5
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,980
Let's all drink up!

6
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,850
Oh, you're drinking too fast.

7
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:08,620
Cheers!

8
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,360
Cheers!

9
00:02:12,550 --> 00:02:13,260
Come on.

10
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,770
Come on, join us.

11
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:15,530
Come on.

12
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:16,510
Sure. Here we go.

13
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:17,790
Cheers!

14
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:27,760
I'm done for the night.

15
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:29,829
Come on, stay in the game.

16
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:30,690
Come on.

17
00:02:32,260 --> 00:02:33,340
Are you okay?

18
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:34,050
What's wrong?

19
00:02:34,490 --> 00:02:34,910
Are you okay?

20
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:35,690
Are you okay?

21
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:06,010
Is that the same guy?

22
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,760
Do you want to puke?

23
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:18,920
Once you're done,

24
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:19,850
we can continue.

25
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:29,620
This is a perfect plan.

26
00:03:29,770 --> 00:03:30,650
I wish I could

27
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:32,100
snag another rich guy.

28
00:03:43,380 --> 00:03:43,950
Come over here!

29
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,530
I caught you in the act.

30
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,210
Not bad.

31
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:05,900
So you've become

32
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:08,490
a real expert in just a few days.

33
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,140
Who are you?

34
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:12,090
Are you

35
00:04:12,380 --> 00:04:13,090
playing dumb? Sure, go on.

36
00:04:14,890 --> 00:04:16,410
Don't you recognize the man who filled your pockets with money?

37
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:21,329
Dayu?

38
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:23,820
I'm a little dizzy, so I didn't recognize you.

39
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,340
I see.

40
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,580
I can't chat with you.

41
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,580
My second uncle is waiting for me.

42
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:27,450
I'm off.

43
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:30,980
Come on,

44
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:32,620
tell me more about this lie.

45
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:35,300
You've broadened my horizons.

46
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,790
This is the first time I'm witnessing such a novel scam.

47
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:40,140
A scam? When did I ever scam you?

48
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:48,820
Not bad.

49
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:50,510
You're spending every penny you have.

50
00:04:54,310 --> 00:04:56,340
You stole quite a bit from my house.

51
00:04:57,120 --> 00:04:58,200
A month hasn't even passed.

52
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:00,300
Did you spend everything?

53
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:03,790
That is quite a headache, isn't it?

54
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,380
When I left that day,

55
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,460
you were still asleep.

56
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,720
I wanted to wake you up to lock the doors,

57
00:05:09,050 --> 00:05:10,490
but you were sleeping like a log.

58
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:11,710
So I left.

59
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:13,420
Did a thief sneak in?

60
00:05:14,790 --> 00:05:15,570
I remember now.

61
00:05:16,200 --> 00:05:17,240
When I left,

62
00:05:17,270 --> 00:05:17,900
it was still dark.

63
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:19,500
I saw two guys

64
00:05:19,660 --> 00:05:20,710
hanging out by your house.

65
00:05:21,170 --> 00:05:22,270
I was still wondering

66
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:23,910
why they were out so early.

67
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,790
I bet those two are the ones responsible.

68
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:28,840
One of them was bald and dressed in black.

69
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:30,350
The other one was limping.

70
00:05:30,850 --> 00:05:31,610
Back then, I—

71
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,690
Did you graduate from Beijing Film Academy?

72
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:37,040
I was an extra in a movie twice.

73
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,030
Are you refusing to let go?

74
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:49,860
Fine,

75
00:05:49,890 --> 00:05:51,210
I'll drag you to the police station.

76
00:05:51,540 --> 00:05:52,340
Sure, let's go!

77
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,860
I'm dying to get arrested.

78
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:55,300
I'll get food and a place to stay for free.

79
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:56,400
I'll even

80
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:57,670
get indoor heating.

81
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:59,010
It'll save on the gas bill.

82
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:01,460
Don't use reverse psychology and act pitifully.

83
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:04,800
People who earn ¥2,000 a month

84
00:06:05,130 --> 00:06:06,570
don't cheat others for money like you.

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:08,870
They can still enjoy their lives.

86
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:10,880
It's all your fault.

87
00:06:11,330 --> 00:06:12,260
My fault?

88
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:13,300
How can you...

89
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:14,340
How can you

90
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,080
play the victim here?

91
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,460
I don't care. It's your fault.

92
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,660
I used to work part-time jobs

93
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,740
like a regular person.

94
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:23,460
You dragged me into this inescapable pit of indulgence.

95
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:26,090
If you hadn't carried me to your home

96
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:27,310
and bullied me,

97
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:29,250
I wouldn't think of stealing.

98
00:06:30,260 --> 00:06:31,220
If you weren't so rich

99
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,480
and owned shoes that cost

100
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:33,670
tens of thousands of yuan, I wouldn't

101
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:34,530
be haunted by such unease.

102
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:36,750
If you hadn't opened the doors

103
00:06:36,770 --> 00:06:37,780
to easy money for me,

104
00:06:38,130 --> 00:06:40,010
I wouldn't be waiting around for victims.

105
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,610
If you hadn't inspired this idea of scamming others,

106
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:44,140
I wouldn't be loitering here all day.

107
00:06:44,230 --> 00:06:44,880
Well,

108
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:47,230
who else can I blame for this?

109
00:06:49,180 --> 00:06:51,540
I guess it's true.

110
00:06:51,540 --> 00:06:52,770
There's a master in every trade.

111
00:06:53,540 --> 00:06:55,580
It's a miracle that a top-tier jerk

112
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,940
like Wang Zhishui can be born.

113
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:01,060
But every douchebag

114
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,560
has a heart-wrenching past.

115
00:07:02,930 --> 00:07:04,450
Listening to his tragic past

116
00:07:04,820 --> 00:07:06,900
would feel more satisfying than sending him to the police station.

117
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:09,420
Let go.

118
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,740
Promise not to hit me.

119
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,360
I won't hit you.

120
00:07:15,950 --> 00:07:16,420
Let go.

121
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:26,790
What's your name?

122
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:28,870
Wang Zhishui.

123
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:29,720
Bullshit!

124
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:31,420
I tried to look you up.

125
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,020
Wang Zhishui doesn't exist.

126
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:34,460
I don't have a registered household.

127
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:35,580
Where are you from?

128
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:37,130
Shandong.

129
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:39,310
Did you come up to the north?

130
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,930
My elder sister drowned in a flood.

131
00:07:47,850 --> 00:07:49,090
That's why my name is Wang Zhishui.

132
00:07:50,310 --> 00:07:51,790
My parents divorced when I was very young.

133
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:53,330
My mom remarried.

134
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:55,740
My dad sold all his properties and fled.

135
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:58,170
I was left behind with my grandma.

136
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,780
I dropped out of school in junior high

137
00:08:01,190 --> 00:08:02,730
and started working as a waiter at thirteen years old.

138
00:08:03,350 --> 00:08:04,750
I only earned ¥240 a month.

139
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,310
After that, my grandma passed away.

140
00:08:08,350 --> 00:08:10,160
My uncle had grudges against my dad,

141
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:12,070
so no one wanted to take me in.

142
00:08:12,820 --> 00:08:14,000
That's why I came to Beijing.

143
00:08:14,930 --> 00:08:16,240
I've been here for eight years,

144
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,330
without a proper place to stay.

145
00:08:17,810 --> 00:08:18,660
I sleep at the train station

146
00:08:18,970 --> 00:08:20,100
or the lobby of hospitals.

147
00:08:20,730 --> 00:08:22,570
How can I get hired without a degree?

148
00:08:22,840 --> 00:08:24,610
I can only work as a laborer or a vendor.

149
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:26,640
Sometimes, I go to the zoo to resell clothes.

150
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:27,980
The money I earn

151
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,300
isn't even worth stealing.

152
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,940
When I met you,

153
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,440
I had less than ¥20 with me.

154
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:36,730
I wanted to sneak some drinks at the bar,

155
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,480
but I was kicked out.

156
00:08:39,130 --> 00:08:40,750
In the end, you carried me home.

157
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,120
You gave me ¥1,000 so easily.

158
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:44,960
I was tempted.

159
00:08:45,740 --> 00:08:46,330
I'm telling the truth.

160
00:08:46,860 --> 00:08:47,900
If you hadn't bullied me,

161
00:08:47,900 --> 00:08:49,140
I wouldn't have stolen your things.

162
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,000
I took that damn money home

163
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:52,130
and dressed myself up nicely.

164
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,530
I bragged in front of my relatives.

165
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,780
Do you know how I felt

166
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,340
when they praised me?

167
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:00,620
Brother.

168
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:01,840
Brother.

169
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,840
I'm begging you.

170
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,850
Take me to the police station.

171
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:07,780
This life

172
00:09:08,540 --> 00:09:10,110
is killing me.

173
00:09:10,580 --> 00:09:12,920
This isn't how a person should live.

174
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,010
If you want to go to the police station,

175
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,940
get there on your own.

176
00:09:54,590 --> 00:09:54,990
Why...

177
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,430
Why are you here?

178
00:09:56,970 --> 00:09:58,450
This is my second time here today.

179
00:09:59,230 --> 00:09:59,790
What?

180
00:10:01,780 --> 00:10:03,060
You know I hate crowds.

181
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:04,580
I just wanted to have some time alone.

182
00:10:05,020 --> 00:10:05,580
All right,

183
00:10:05,580 --> 00:10:06,340
come in.

184
00:10:06,580 --> 00:10:07,260
I'm not going in.

185
00:10:07,570 --> 00:10:08,710
I just want to tell you something.

186
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,740
I found Wang Zhishui.

187
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,460
Did you find him?

188
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,620
Where did you find him?

189
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:15,530
Where is he now?

190
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,220
Listen to me.

191
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,220
Were you cheated?

192
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:33,260
That's impossible.

193
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:34,880
He wouldn't dare lie to me.

194
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:37,810
That's true.

195
00:10:38,260 --> 00:10:39,890
Con men hardly con the same person twice.

196
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:43,780
What time is it?

197
00:10:53,900 --> 00:10:55,420
Didn't you buy a new watch?

198
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:56,560
Why aren't you wearing it?

199
00:10:58,920 --> 00:10:59,340
Brother.

200
00:11:00,280 --> 00:11:01,320
I'm begging you.

201
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:03,300
Take me to the police station.

202
00:11:24,140 --> 00:11:24,940
Wang Zhishui.

203
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:26,520
I'll drown you in my urine

204
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,960
if I catch you again.

205
00:11:32,450 --> 00:11:34,260
I'll be giving a brief observation.

206
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:36,250
I observed your combat training earlier.

207
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:40,300
Firstly, you have to understand the five-color theory.

208
00:11:40,690 --> 00:11:41,680
What's the five-color theory?

209
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:43,080
During our training,

210
00:11:43,220 --> 00:11:44,130
we must

211
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:46,830
transition from

212
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,730
white to the aggressive

213
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:49,790
state of black.

214
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,440
Secondly,

215
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:51,920
you have to

216
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:52,760
master your

217
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:54,940
strongest combat techniques

218
00:11:54,940 --> 00:11:56,650
to perfection.

219
00:11:57,740 --> 00:11:58,820
Do you understand?

220
00:11:59,020 --> 00:11:59,770
Understood!

221
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,300
Stand up.

222
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:05,690
Today's training has come to an end.

223
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,190
Thank you, Instructor Chen.

224
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,210
You're dismissed!

225
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:52,460
Here, everyone.

226
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:54,820
I brought pomegranates.

227
00:13:00,740 --> 00:13:01,500
Take it easy.

228
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:22,300
Do I get a share?

229
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,180
You can pick one

230
00:13:24,460 --> 00:13:25,220
from the leftovers.

231
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,100
Mr. Yuan,

232
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,520
why is your pomegranate

233
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:37,980
so much bigger than mine?

234
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:40,450
Man,

235
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:42,170
it's double the size of mine.

236
00:13:42,950 --> 00:13:43,830
It's bright red

237
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:45,070
and huge.

238
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,500
Look at mine. It's green and purple.

239
00:13:46,930 --> 00:13:48,890
Exactly, but I was the first one who took from the box.

240
00:13:49,050 --> 00:13:50,500
Why didn't I spot such a great pomegranate?

241
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,140
Don't ask me.

242
00:13:52,700 --> 00:13:53,350
Why are you complaining?

243
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:55,180
If you think it's too small, give it back.

244
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,440
You don't deserve it.

245
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:04,220
Here, for you.

246
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:07,320
Why is your hand so cold?

247
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,810
Didn't you wear your thermal pants?

248
00:14:10,270 --> 00:14:12,230
I haven't worn thermal pants in ages.

249
00:14:13,820 --> 00:14:14,540
Why so smug?

250
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,740
I'm not being smug.

251
00:14:17,210 --> 00:14:18,550
This is my attitude.

252
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,600
I will not be defeated by Mother Nature.

253
00:14:30,630 --> 00:14:31,220
Manager,

254
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:31,660
come over here.

255
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,740
Coming.

256
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,390
Leave a little later today.

257
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,410
Test the heating system.

258
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:39,570
Turn on the heater starting tomorrow.

259
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,300
Turn on the heater starting tomorrow?

260
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,750
It's only the 2nd.

261
00:14:43,780 --> 00:14:45,580
We usually turn on the heater on the 17th or 18th of every year.

262
00:14:45,890 --> 00:14:47,050
Turning it on two weeks earlier

263
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,120
will result in hefty costs.

264
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:50,440
Deduct the amount

265
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:51,670
from my private funds.

266
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:53,140
Yes, okay.

267
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,230
All right, get going.

268
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:24,570
It's warm.

269
00:15:25,050 --> 00:15:26,290
The heater is turned on really early.

270
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,300
Folks,

271
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:34,650
change into your swimwear right away.

272
00:15:34,780 --> 00:15:36,580
We're conducting underwater combat training today.

273
00:15:37,120 --> 00:15:37,760
Xia Yao, hurry.

274
00:15:37,990 --> 00:15:38,390
Yes.

275
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:35,430
Everyone is assembled.

276
00:16:35,770 --> 00:16:36,220
At ease.

277
00:16:40,580 --> 00:16:41,540
Underwater combat training

278
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,790
is a comprehensive practical skill.

279
00:16:46,090 --> 00:16:47,270
Due to the buoyancy,

280
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,060
resistance, pressure,

281
00:16:49,590 --> 00:16:50,910
and thermal conductivity of water,

282
00:16:51,460 --> 00:16:52,480
underwater combat requires

283
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,780
even more well-rounded physical fitness.

284
00:16:56,020 --> 00:16:56,610
Today,

285
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:57,670
we'll be conducting basic

286
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,180
underwater combat training.

287
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,550
Mr. Yuan

288
00:17:00,990 --> 00:17:02,410
will enter the pool

289
00:17:02,740 --> 00:17:03,650
and give us a demonstration.

290
00:17:32,990 --> 00:17:34,130
All of you. In the pool.

291
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:55,300
What were you doing

292
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,080
when I was explaining the main points?

293
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:57,720
I wasn't listening.

294
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:02,310
Behave.

295
00:18:03,270 --> 00:18:04,210
Everyone is staring at you.

296
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:05,380
Come on,

297
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:06,260
listen to my instructions.

298
00:18:06,530 --> 00:18:06,970
Get up.

299
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:08,810
One, two, three.

300
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:14,900
Don't bend your legs.

301
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:16,740
Straighten your legs.

302
00:18:18,990 --> 00:18:19,630
Move your legs more.

303
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,150
Good.

304
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:25,380
Keep at it for a little longer.

305
00:18:29,540 --> 00:18:30,010
Mr. Yuan,

306
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:32,090
he's already doing very well.

307
00:18:32,630 --> 00:18:34,680
Can you guide the others now?

308
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,540
Continue.

309
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:47,040
Hold on a little longer.

310
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:50,650
Okay,

311
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:51,670
a little more.

312
00:18:52,870 --> 00:18:53,550
More strength in your legs.

313
00:18:55,810 --> 00:18:56,280
Lift your head.
