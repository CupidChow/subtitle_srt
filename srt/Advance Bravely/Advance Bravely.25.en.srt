What are you doing here?

7
00:02:09,979 --> 00:02:12,020
I went to look for a famous store selling sour and spicy noodles.

8
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,280
The two bowls I ate yesterday weren't enough,

9
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,540
so I went to buy more today.

10
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,940
I brought them here for you to try.

If you like rich tastes,

14
00:02:21,950 --> 00:02:23,140
I have two extra packets of vinegar.
