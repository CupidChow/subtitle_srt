[Episode 5]

4
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,730
I need to go out for a while.

5
00:02:14,390 --> 00:02:15,540
Can you take care of it for me?

6
00:02:17,870 --> 00:02:19,280
What if I disagree?

7
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:20,310
Well then I won't go out.

8
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,440
Come in to sit for a while.

9
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:48,220
Listen up.

10
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,790
Don't bully Blackie.

11
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:52,579
Love you.

12
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:53,880
If you talk any more nonsense,

13
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:55,280
I'll smack you.

14
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:56,790
Smack you.

15
00:02:56,829 --> 00:02:57,180
You.

16
00:02:57,390 --> 00:02:58,110
Smack you.

17
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,980
Son,

18
00:02:59,010 --> 00:02:59,780
what's wrong?

19
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:01,700
Be quiet.

20
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:03,020
If you make any more ruckus,

21
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,080
I'll rip your beak off!

22
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:05,140
Rip off!

23
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:10,370
Love you.

24
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:11,570
Love you.

25
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,190
You're so charming.

26
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,880
You're so charming.

27
00:03:20,420 --> 00:03:22,270
A bird really does take after its master.

28
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:28,660
Take off your tank top.

29
00:03:29,079 --> 00:03:30,410
Take off your undies.

30
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,329
What the heck did it say?

31
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,280
Shut up!

32
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:37,170
No.

33
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,400
Too noisy!

34
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:39,300
Really annoying.

35
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:40,610
What can you do?

36
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:41,770
Shut up!

37
00:03:42,010 --> 00:03:42,900
Shut up!

38
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:43,870
Talk your ear off.

39
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,520
Are you getting angry?

40
00:03:45,870 --> 00:03:47,450
Too noisy. So annoying.

41
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:48,710
Come on.

42
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:49,500
Shut up.

43
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:50,650
Shut up.

44
00:03:50,820 --> 00:03:51,870
Come to hit me.

45
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:52,810
Shut up.

46
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:53,660
Come to hit me.

47
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:54,450
So annoying.

48
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,460
So annoying.

49
00:03:55,710 --> 00:03:56,800
You're so charming.

50
00:03:57,250 --> 00:03:58,170
You're so charming.

51
00:03:58,190 --> 00:03:58,990
Too noisy.

52
00:03:59,020 --> 00:03:59,820
So annoying.

53
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,710
No.

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:01,950
What can you do?

55
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:02,970
Shut up.

56
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:03,850
No.

57
00:04:04,010 --> 00:04:04,890
Shut up.

58
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,180
Xia Yao, where are you going?

59
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,340
Come here.

60
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,780
You are even not worried about your own matters.

61
00:04:18,589 --> 00:04:19,630
Look, what do you think about this one?

62
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:21,810
Mom,

63
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:23,470
are you looking for a stepdad for me?

64
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:25,020
Damn

65
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:26,020
brat.

66
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,360
Look, what do you think about him?

67
00:04:32,470 --> 00:04:32,930
You...

68
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:34,900
Listen,

69
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,030
don't give that bird to others.

70
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:36,930
I really like it.

71
00:04:38,409 --> 00:04:39,300
You like it?

72
00:04:39,659 --> 00:04:40,650
Of course.

73
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:42,060
This bird

74
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:43,070
is such a sweet talker.

75
00:04:43,090 --> 00:04:44,650
It's always saying, "Love you."

76
00:04:44,870 --> 00:04:46,510
It is much more lovable than your bird.

77
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:48,070
Your bird often says dirty words.

78
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,409
It has such a foul mouth.

79
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,930
If you don't want to keep that bird,

80
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,070
you can leave it on my balcony.

81
00:04:52,850 --> 00:04:53,310
Forget it.

82
00:04:53,610 --> 00:04:54,750
I'll keep it in my room.

83
00:04:56,730 --> 00:04:57,280
Yao!

84
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,120
Hurry up.

85
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,250
Hurry up.

86
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:47,900
Hurry up.

87
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:12,870
You!

88
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,420
Ten more log-carrying drills

89
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:15,720
after training!

90
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,880
As a bodyguard,

91
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,420
your employer's safety is the top priority,

92
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,920
and your dignity is secondary!

93
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,760
If you want to become an eligible bodyguard,

94
00:06:22,930 --> 00:06:24,290
you must sacrifice your own dignity.

95
00:06:32,930 --> 00:06:33,720
Move faster!

96
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:39,210
Hurry up.

97
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:45,990
Mr. Yuan,

98
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:46,800
let's speak in private.

99
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:56,780
Mr. Yuan,

100
00:06:56,980 --> 00:06:57,560
we've figured it out.

101
00:06:58,250 --> 00:06:59,220
Those four men

102
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:00,350
were sent by Leopard.

103
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,310
He failed back then.

104
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,890
He must retaliate again.

105
00:07:04,810 --> 00:07:06,370
Since you aren't in Beijing,

106
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:08,690
he might strike when our guard is down.

107
00:07:09,610 --> 00:07:10,280
I think

108
00:07:10,510 --> 00:07:11,970
you had better bring Yuan Ru here.

109
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:14,870
You can make the arrangements.

110
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,040
By the way,

111
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:18,680
I heard that

112
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:20,680
Leopard is investigating Xia Yao.

113
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,710
Xia Yao?

114
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:23,710
Yes.

115
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,440
Leopard is such a person.

116
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:26,840
He's too vindictive.

117
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,740
He can't spare anyone who foiled his plans.

118
00:07:29,390 --> 00:07:30,390
But it's good for him to investigate Xia Yao.

119
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,590
He will realize

120
00:07:31,650 --> 00:07:33,170
who he offended.

121
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:35,340
If the Xia family really bites back,

122
00:07:35,790 --> 00:07:37,060
his whole life will be ruined.

123
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:31,540
Move faster!

124
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:32,790
Lift your legs!

125
00:09:33,950 --> 00:09:34,830
This drill trains

126
00:09:34,870 --> 00:09:35,950
your balance.

127
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:37,460
Don't sway your arms!

128
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,410
Move faster.

129
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,320
Lift your legs!

130
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,590
Faster!

131
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,160
Faster!

132
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:43,590
Faster!

133
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:48,950
Mr. Yuan.

134
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,200
Why do you look unwell?

135
00:09:52,850 --> 00:09:53,870
Didn't you sleep well last night?

136
00:09:55,270 --> 00:09:56,150
None of your business.

137
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:00,450
What...

138
00:10:01,630 --> 00:10:03,460
I've never heard him speak like that before.

139
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:05,500
Did he have a exciting night?

140
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:08,860
Faster! Faster!

141
00:10:16,770 --> 00:10:17,690
These days,

142
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,000
the myna has been quieter.

143
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:21,800
It has stopped chirping at night.

144
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:51,560
What is he doing?

145
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:09,800
Why are you standing on my balcony in the middle of the night

146
00:11:10,860 --> 00:11:12,020
instead of sleeping?

147
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:16,860
I know what you mean.

148
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,690
I'll emphasize it again.

149
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,670
I saved your sister out of goodwill

150
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:24,630
and without any selfish reason.

151
00:11:25,330 --> 00:11:27,240
You don't have to thank me in this manner.

152
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,650
Besides, this is unnecessary.

153
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:34,690
On this land,

154
00:11:35,620 --> 00:11:37,290
no one can lay a finger on me.

155
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:43,810
Hey.

156
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,840
Can you just leave?

157
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:48,060
You stay rooted here.

158
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,550
How can I fall into sleep?

159
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,260
OK.

160
00:12:06,390 --> 00:12:07,810
If that's what you want,

161
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:09,030
I'll let you put on your show.

162
00:12:10,170 --> 00:12:11,650
Anyway, I'm not the one bitten by mosquitoes.

163
00:13:33,470 --> 00:13:34,750
Why am I doing something so meaningless?

164
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:37,840
I should just make things clear

165
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:40,750
and chase him away.

166
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:49,670
Forget it.

167
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:52,500
Soldiers from the special forces

168
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:55,200
have extraordinary psychological qualities

169
00:13:55,430 --> 00:13:56,850
and unbreakable wills.

170
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:00,390
Someone like him

171
00:14:00,580 --> 00:14:01,380
can't be driven away.

172
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:34,460
Leave right now.

173
00:15:37,420 --> 00:15:38,900
Don't you see that there's a strong wind?

174
00:15:48,590 --> 00:15:49,370
Whatever!

175
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:50,690
Let the wind blow him away!

176
00:16:08,990 --> 00:16:09,630
Come inside.

177
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:13,480
Take a bath first.

178
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:34,820
You!

179
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:41,810
What's going on?

180
00:16:42,750 --> 00:16:44,260
He is here not for his sister

181
00:16:45,070 --> 00:16:46,300
but for himself?

182
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,550
I have a trauma about women's legs,

183
00:16:50,620 --> 00:16:52,060
but I'm straight!
