When will the two kids meet?

8
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:24,310
Didn't they meet yesterday?

9
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,170
Yesterday?

10
00:02:26,660 --> 00:02:28,400
The girl was always with me yesterday.

11
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,670
Did he meet someone else?

12
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,360
Darned brat.

13
00:02:47,579 --> 00:02:48,010
Hey.

14
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,640
Auntie.

15
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:49,220
Dayu?

16
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,060
Are you going out?

17
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:50,340
Yes.

18
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,000
I'm going on a stroll with the bird.

19
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,470

for a blind date.

22
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,500
A-A blind date?

His dad introduced a girl to him.

24

00:02:59,170 --> 00:02:59,880
No. Auntie.

I have something to do.

27
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:02,020
I have to leave.

Go.

Hey.

32
00:03:19,250 --> 00:03:20,060
Such bad luck.

33
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,570
Why is the traffic so crowded today?

34
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:43,050
Hello.

35
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:44,820
What's going on inside?

36
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,420
There's a temple fair. Don't you know that?

37
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,000
A temple fair?

38
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:10,900

Authentic figures!

44
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,410

So pretty.

47
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:28,340
Do you want it? Cheap linen pillows!

48
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:29,820
Look at the handcraft.

49
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:30,610
How much is this?

50
00:04:30,610 --> 00:04:31,780
It's made really well.

51
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:04,980
Great.

52
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:12,860

Great.

56
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,970
Wow.

57
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,440
Amazing.

58
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:45,540
Good.

59
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:47,570
Amazing.

60
00:05:47,690 --> 00:05:49,880
Wow.

61
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,700
My performance has ended!

62
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:52,540
Thank you!

63
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:54,460
Great!

with your warm applause!

68
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,620
Come on.

69
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,640
He has a pair of magical hands

70
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:08,780
that can conjure anything

71
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,950
you desire.

72
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,460
Today,

73
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:23,460
I'm very happy that you're here to watch my magic show!

74
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,620
Next,

75
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,710
let's get started.

76
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,590
I have tons of treasures here.

77
00:06:29,620 --> 00:06:30,340
Here

78
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:31,410
is a cup.

79
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:32,659
Look clearly.

80
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,880
The cup is empty, right?

81
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:34,750
Very common, right?

82
00:06:34,770 --> 00:06:35,800
There's nothing in it, right?

83
00:06:38,890 --> 00:06:40,860
Abracadabra!

84
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:43,120
Wow!

85
00:06:44,130 --> 00:06:45,380
I'll conjure something else.

86
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:47,370
Isn't that just a red napkin?

87
00:06:47,980 --> 00:06:48,380
Yes.

88
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,020
A red napkin.

89
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,940
This is just an ordinary red napkin, right?

90
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,440
Yes.

91
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:52,670
Very ordinary, right?

92
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,300
Yes.

93
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:53,970
Okay.

94
00:06:54,170 --> 00:06:55,050
Look clearly.

95
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:07,320
Wow!

96
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:08,530
I'll conjure

97
00:07:09,170 --> 00:07:10,210
something more impressive.

98
00:07:10,250 --> 00:07:11,440
Okay.

99
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,390
Look clearly.

100
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,670
Nothing in my hand, right?

101
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:16,460
Yes.

102
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,330
Okay.

103
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:19,420
Abracadabra!

104
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,260
Wow!

105
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,120
Give it to me!

106
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,870
Where is your applause?

107
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:27,100
Give it to me!

108
00:07:27,100 --> 00:07:27,720
Give it to me!

109
00:07:27,750 --> 00:07:28,550
Give it to me!

110
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:28,970
I'm hungry!

111
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:29,480
Yes.

112
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:30,230
You're hungry, right?

113
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,010
Yes.

114
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:31,910
Very good.

115
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,760
Next.

116
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:33,750
I'll fill your stomach!

117
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,409
I'll make food appear, okay?

118
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,560
My god.

119
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:38,060
I'll roll up my sleeves.

120
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,140
I don't hide anything, right?

121
00:07:39,140 --> 00:07:39,980
Yes.

122
00:07:39,980 --> 00:07:40,880
Look clearly.

123
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:45,020
Abracadabra!

124
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:46,390
Wow!

125
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,150
Does anyone want this?

126
00:07:47,170 --> 00:07:48,080
Me!

127
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,090
Kids, don't blink.

128
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:55,020
Mr. Magic Beans not only can

129
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:56,450
make food appear,

130
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,720
but also can make toys appear!

131
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,020
Toys?

132
00:07:59,060 --> 00:07:59,740
He also can conjure toys.

133
00:07:59,740 --> 00:08:00,420
Okay.

134
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,410
Look closely.

135
00:08:03,130 --> 00:08:04,490
Abracadabra!

136
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,520
Wow!

137
00:08:07,130 --> 00:08:08,100
Who wants this?

138
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:08,970
Me!

139
00:08:08,990 --> 00:08:10,190
Whose cheering is the loudest?

140
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:12,030
Here.

141
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,850
I want the big one.

142
00:08:19,490 --> 00:08:20,490
I want the big one.

143
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:22,090
One more!

144
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,460
Why are you leaving?

145
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:48,470
I didn't know

146
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:49,940
you even can make things appear.

147
00:08:51,310 --> 00:08:51,980
I thought

148
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:53,360
you could only make things disappear.

149
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:56,040
Don't talk like that.

150
00:08:58,530 --> 00:08:59,460
How many days have you been working?

151
00:09:00,590 --> 00:09:01,550
From

152
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:02,970
the day the temple fair started.

153
00:09:04,690 --> 00:09:05,920
When do you plan to stop?

154
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,070
Until the temple fair ends.

155
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:08,860
It's needless to ask that.

156
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,290
Okay.

157
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,390
Good.

158
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:14,430
You're having a fulfilling new year.

159
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:18,220
I can't chat more with you

160
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:19,190
I have to make preparations.

161
00:09:35,690 --> 00:09:36,130
Great.

162
00:09:36,150 --> 00:09:37,520
Great.

163
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,510
Wow!

164
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:41,440
Wow!

165
00:09:42,130 --> 00:09:43,850
Wow!

166
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:13,430
Hey.

167
00:10:13,450 --> 00:10:14,160
You're still here.

168
00:10:14,190 --> 00:10:15,020
I'm leaving soon.

169
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,960
Why haven't you finished your show?

170
00:10:18,620 --> 00:10:19,490
It's still early.

171
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:20,580
I have a night shift.

172
00:10:23,340 --> 00:10:24,960
How much do they pay you per shift?

173
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,190
Around ¥3,000

174
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,130
a day.

175
00:10:30,740 --> 00:10:31,330
How about this?

176
00:10:32,140 --> 00:10:33,100
I'll pay you ¥30,000.

177
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:34,720
Go drinking with me.

178
00:10:35,840 --> 00:10:37,430
If I knew you would say that, I would have said ¥5,000.

179
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:38,350
Deal.

180
00:10:38,660 --> 00:10:39,320
I'll get off work.

181
00:11:46,510 --> 00:11:47,920
My parents stayed in other places.

182
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:49,970
You're always wandering about, too.

183
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:52,220
Why don't we spend the new year together?

184
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,210
We only have accommodations

185
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,390
when we work the night shift.

186
00:12:05,790 --> 00:12:07,060
So I have no place to stay tonight.

187
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,680
Can I stay here for the night?

188
00:12:08,920 --> 00:12:09,410
Feel free.

189
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,140
As long as you won't stay in my room.

190
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:13,110
But I'm scared of sleeping alone.

191
00:12:13,780 --> 00:12:14,260
What?

192
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:16,660
You aren't even scared of banging your head against the ground.

193
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,980
Why are you scared of sleeping alone?

194
00:12:18,180 --> 00:12:18,670
Really.

195
00:12:18,690 --> 00:12:19,510
I'm really scared.

196
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,830
I would rather sleep in the hospital lobby or the train station

197
00:12:22,020 --> 00:12:23,370
than rent a room alone.

198
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:30,470
Do you know what?

199
00:12:30,690 --> 00:12:32,630
That old lady hanged herself.

200
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:35,800
She hanged herself on her grandson's door frame.

201
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,460
Sleep wherever you want to.

202
00:12:50,900 --> 00:12:52,990
He looks really worn out.

203
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:18,780
You gave me too much.

204
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:23,680
¥10,000 is a new year's gift.

205
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:25,680
Another ¥10,000

206
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,300
is to treat your scar.

207
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:29,970
You're extremely rich.

208
00:13:30,370 --> 00:13:31,720
What's your family business?

209
00:13:32,250 --> 00:13:33,370
None of your business.

210
00:13:35,030 --> 00:13:36,470
Think this twice.

211
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,060
I'm shameless.

212
00:13:38,110 --> 00:13:39,430
I'll take whatever money you give me.

213
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:40,720
And I won't feel grateful.

214
00:13:41,050 --> 00:13:41,720
Maybe

215
00:13:41,750 --> 00:13:42,830
I even laugh at your stupidity.

216
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:46,370
I just require you to keep quiet about this.

217
00:13:47,300 --> 00:13:48,130
Why?

218
00:13:49,350 --> 00:13:50,600
I can't afford to lose face.

219
00:13:55,650 --> 00:13:56,650
Are you sure you won't be my sugar daddy?

220
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:58,690
Screw you.

221
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:11,800
My conscience is clear.

222
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:13,670
I feel assured.

223
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,520
We're strangers from now on.

224
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:47,610
If I haven't gotten up by 7 o'clock,

225
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:48,900
my brother will bang on my door.

226
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,580
It's already so late. Why is he so quiet today?

227
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:03,300
Brother,

228
00:15:03,590 --> 00:15:04,940
why aren't you up yet?

229
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:09,330
Brother!

230
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:13,560
That's odd.

231
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,710
He never locks his door when he sleeps.

232
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:18,070
Could it be...

233
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,550
That's impossible.

234
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:22,380
Girls from such a poor village

235
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,060
are unlikely to arouse my brother's interest.

236
00:15:47,370 --> 00:15:47,910
Brother!

237
00:15:47,930 --> 00:15:48,710
Why don't you still...

238
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:56,880
Ah.

239
00:15:57,210 --> 00:15:57,670
He...

240
00:15:58,010 --> 00:15:59,500
He...Why is he...

241
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,620
Am I dreaming?

242
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,010
So noisy.

243
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:10,860
What are you doing?

244
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,480
I just want to prove

245
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:13,980
I am not dreaming.

246
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,090
Brother.

247
00:16:17,290 --> 00:16:18,360
When did he come here?

248
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,060
Last night.

249
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:22,430
Last night?

250
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,190
Did you two agree on this?

251
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:29,560
I don't know where this guy popped up from.

252
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:32,890
Xia Yao.

253
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:34,240
Xia Yao.

254
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:37,760
Who did you plan to surprise?

255
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,170
I just come here to travel.

256
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:45,250
What's up?

257
00:16:45,780 --> 00:16:47,010
Are you feeling shy?

258
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:53,380
It smells amazing.

259
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:00,010
Delicious!

260
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,310
Authentic.

261
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:14,280
Why are you always staring at him.

262
00:17:22,200 --> 00:17:23,460
This is also delicious.

263
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:24,680
Delicious.

264
00:17:26,740 --> 00:17:28,490
I want to eat those meatballs, too.

265
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,900
Okay.

266
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:32,390
If you can catch it,

267
00:17:33,130 --> 00:17:33,820
I'll toss it to you.

268
00:17:34,400 --> 00:17:34,800
Okay.

269
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:41,020
Get ready.

270
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,050
Yes.

271
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:42,820
Three.

272
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,360
Two.
