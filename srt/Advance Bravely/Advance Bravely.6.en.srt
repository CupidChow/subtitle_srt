[Episode 6]

4
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,340
Can you let me out now?

5
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,450
Where is he?

6
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:39,150
I tied him up.

7
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:40,610
I'll send him to the police tomorrow morning.

8
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,210
Why did you lock your window

9
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:43,990
and not allow me to go outside?

10
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:45,720
I didn't want you to get caught in the rain.

11
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:51,520
What do you mean?

12
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,490
I'm worrying about you for my sister's sake.

13
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:57,500
Don't think I'll like your sister

14
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,000
just because you did this for me.

15
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:01,360
You can't force someone to build a relationship with others.

16
00:03:02,090 --> 00:03:02,740
I saved her

17
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:03,730
simply because I...

18
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:05,340
Hey!

19
00:03:06,100 --> 00:03:07,040
I'm not done talking!

20
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,500
The world's great matter

21
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,710
gets united after longtime division surely,

22
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:48,680
and divides after longtime union surely.

23
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:57,860
Love ya.

24
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:58,720
Love ya.

25
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,480
I love you.

26
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,490
Hello, Peng Ze.

27
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,390
What's up?

28
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,170
Me?

29
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,660
I'm fine.

30
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,240
I'm just chilling.

31
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:13,930
Hey.

32
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:14,750
What?

33
00:04:16,550 --> 00:04:17,230
Oh, well...

34
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,029
I'm going to take a shower.

35
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:19,959
Let's catch up later.

36
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,460
You're back.

37
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,420
Laiyang Pear.

38
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:30,400
It's a specialty.

39
00:04:30,980 --> 00:04:32,420
I have a lot of pears in my house.

40
00:04:32,920 --> 00:04:34,070
Besides, they are exclusive products,

41
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:35,400
100% organic, pollution-free.

42
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,610
I don't need your crappy pears.

43
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:38,820
Wait.

44
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:39,580
Come back.

45
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,570
Didn't you just say these pears are crappy?

46
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:45,850
Well,

47
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,810
it's not that I can only digest top-grade pears.

48
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:52,460
Sometimes I do need these low-quality ones

49
00:04:52,550 --> 00:04:53,550
for a change of appetite.

50
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,630
Give them to me.

51
00:05:09,310 --> 00:05:11,240
This pear looks rough on the outside,

52
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:13,130
but surprisingly white on the inside.

53
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:18,460
How does it taste?

54
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,190
Just so-so.

55
00:05:26,170 --> 00:05:26,780
Do you want some?

56
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:28,140
If you want to eat it, I'll share the half of it with you.

57
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,060
I can't finish it anyway.

58
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:31,460
Pears aren't meant to be shared.

59
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:34,040
You're quite superstitious.

60
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:42,909
Hurry and take this little bird back.

61
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:44,950
Isn't it enjoying its time here?

62
00:05:46,090 --> 00:05:47,210
Just let it keep you company for a few more days.

63
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,250
I don't need its company.

64
00:05:49,730 --> 00:05:50,230
What now?

65
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,760
I thought you're fond of birds.

66
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:53,960
Yes, I'm fond of birds.

67
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,300
But I'm not a fan of your bird.

68
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,280
Why so?

69
00:05:57,770 --> 00:05:58,700
Because it's too big.

70
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:01,930
Really?

71
00:06:03,730 --> 00:06:05,420
Actually, because it's too noisy.

72
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,560
It always keeps talking all day long.

73
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,550
Isn't that the exact reason why people raise grackle?

74
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:13,290
But it keeps blabbering.

75
00:06:14,970 --> 00:06:15,610
What did it say?

76
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,040
Nothing unusual.

77
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,260
I have a question.

78
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:21,250
Who's taking care of this bird usually?

79
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:22,570
Is it your sister?

80
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:24,850
Why do you ask?

81
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,080
Well...

82
00:06:28,650 --> 00:06:29,230
Nothing.

83
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,700
Anyway, just take your bird

84
00:06:33,070 --> 00:06:33,770
and get out of here.

85
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,770
Brother.

86
00:06:52,090 --> 00:06:54,130
Please let me go out and have fun.

87
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:55,580
Ever since I was back to Beijing,

88
00:06:55,620 --> 00:06:56,740
I've been locked up in here,

89
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,870
watching you guys training all day long.

90
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,540
I'm dying of boredom!

91
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:02,930
Have you forgotten

92
00:07:03,660 --> 00:07:04,710
how you were almost kidnapped?

93
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:08,240
That's because you were their enemy and I became their easier target.

94
00:07:08,410 --> 00:07:10,000
I didn't find trouble myself.

95
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,120
Really?

96
00:07:13,540 --> 00:07:14,380
But how come I've heard that

97
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:15,610
someone in that gang

98
00:07:15,660 --> 00:07:16,770
had already hooked up with you?

99
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,620
And he kept asking you out for dates multiple times?

100
00:07:19,420 --> 00:07:20,240
Otherwise,

101
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,480
how could they know about your movements?

102
00:07:24,430 --> 00:07:26,010
How would I know

103
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,450
that my friends included Leopard's sidekick?

104
00:07:30,840 --> 00:07:31,400
Friends?

105
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,330
Now you're calling people who just hang out with you for clubbing as friends?

106
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:36,700
That's because

107
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:38,540
I was having a bad time because of Xia Yao.

108
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:40,820
So I just had some fun for a couple of days.

109
00:07:42,380 --> 00:07:44,230
I was thinking about quitting.

110
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,400
Who would have thought

111
00:07:48,430 --> 00:07:50,080
he would be so heroic?

112
00:07:50,980 --> 00:07:51,790
Hey, brother.

113
00:07:52,130 --> 00:07:53,909
Now you won't be judging my taste anymore, right?

114
00:07:54,330 --> 00:07:57,159
Xia Yao's character, appearance, and personality

115
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,350
are all flawless.

116
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,220
It's just a pity that...

117
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:08,430
What?

118
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:11,490
Nothing.

119
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:14,440
Anyway, with medical technology being so advanced now,

120
00:08:18,170 --> 00:08:18,770
brother,

121
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:21,130
please just let me go and have some fun for a couple of days.

122
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:21,920
I promise,

123
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,340
I won't go anywhere else.

124
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,360
I'll just go to Xia Yao's place.

125
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,490
You don't need to look for him.

126
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:28,780
Why?

127
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:31,520
He will come knocking himself.

128
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,419
"He'll come knocking?"

129
00:08:38,780 --> 00:08:40,539
What does that mean?

130
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:45,890
Blackie.

131
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:48,310
Blackie.

132
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:50,260
Blackie.

133
00:08:55,050 --> 00:08:56,620
Are you upset because I neglected you?

134
00:09:00,090 --> 00:09:00,700
Blackie.

135
00:09:01,510 --> 00:09:02,340
-My son! -It's time to eat.

136
00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:03,420
Come, drink this.

137
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:06,330
What's wrong with it?

138
00:09:06,980 --> 00:09:08,620
Maybe it's missing that big bird.

139
00:09:10,100 --> 00:09:11,380
Thinking of that big sluggish bird?

140
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:12,660
That's impossible.

141
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,790
When that bird was still in our house,

142
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,230
these two were always bickering.

143
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:18,320
My Blackie always got bullied by the big one.

144
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,140
How could it possibly miss that one's presence?

145
00:09:20,180 --> 00:09:20,660
Hey.

146
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:21,400
Birds are like that,

147
00:09:21,490 --> 00:09:22,510
they feel happy when they have a partner.

148
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:44,970
As the saying goes,

149
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,870
The world's great matter

150
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,350
-gets united after longtime division surely...
-Who's talking?

151
00:09:49,390 --> 00:09:50,940
and divides after longtime union surely.

152
00:09:53,020 --> 00:09:53,650
Hello, guys.

153
00:09:53,900 --> 00:09:55,180
I'm Zeng Zhiwei.

154
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:55,960
Blah, blah, blah.

155
00:09:56,050 --> 00:09:56,850
Blah, blah, blah.

156
00:09:58,130 --> 00:09:58,900
Blah, blah, blah.

157
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,850
I've never met someone so hopeless like you.

158
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,410
Blackie!

159
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:18,230
Take a look.

160
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:20,000
I brought you a new friend.

161
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,050
Get along.

162
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:25,910
Hello.

163
00:10:29,220 --> 00:10:29,960
Hello.

164
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:32,850
Have you eaten?

165
00:10:36,110 --> 00:10:36,800
Have you eaten?

166
00:10:40,210 --> 00:10:41,090
Hello.

167
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:44,360
Hello.

168
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:47,830
Blackie.

169
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:52,550
How are you?

170
00:10:53,810 --> 00:10:55,490
You don't like the polite one?

171
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,450
Why do you have to miss that jerk?

172
00:10:57,450 --> 00:10:58,180
Hello.

173
00:10:58,450 --> 00:10:59,620
You're so pathetic.

174
00:11:11,980 --> 00:11:13,080
Bring your bird to me.

175
00:11:31,870 --> 00:11:33,270
Why did you need me to bring this bird back?

176
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,600
Because my Blackie likes it.

177
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:36,860
It can't live without this one.

178
00:11:37,290 --> 00:11:38,860
So I decided to adopt your bird now.

179
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:39,830
Give me a number.

180
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:40,840
I'm not selling it.

181
00:11:41,610 --> 00:11:42,290
Not for sale, huh?

182
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,750
I'll just take it away.

183
00:11:45,010 --> 00:11:45,680
How about this?

184
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:47,060
From now on,

185
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,590
I can let it hang out with your bird every day.

186
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:50,990
I don't mind

187
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:51,940
if it can fly over by itself.

188
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:18,590
Fancy, but useless.

189
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,170
By the way,

190
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,500
is your company recruiting new trainees?

191
00:12:30,250 --> 00:12:30,750
No.

192
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:33,860
Can you make an exception and let me train for a while?

193
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:35,680
I've been

194
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:36,730
very curious about your company.

195
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:39,670
We only accept full-time trainees now.

196
00:12:40,080 --> 00:12:41,790
I can pay the fees as a full-time trainee.

197
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,150
Just let me take some courses during the holidays.

198
00:12:44,590 --> 00:12:45,270
Is that okay?

199
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:45,980
Nope.

200
00:12:46,730 --> 00:12:47,490
Why?

201
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:48,470
It's not necessary.

202
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,900
Why do you say so?

203
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:53,270
The training at your company is very useful.

204
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,830
For those

205
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,520
in high-risk jobs like me,

206
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,560
it's important to learn

207
00:12:58,660 --> 00:12:59,750
how to defend myself and others.

208
00:13:00,980 --> 00:13:01,620
Anyway,

209
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,190
don't think about it.

210
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:03,970
Why can't I take the course?

211
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:05,490
I'm going to!

212
00:13:10,670 --> 00:13:11,930
Why aren't I allowed to join?

213
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,260
Does he think I'm a freeloader or incompetent?

214
00:13:15,970 --> 00:13:16,630
I'm telling you,

215
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:17,900
Mr. Yuan

216
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,990
used to be the gunslinger in the unit.

217
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:21,710
No one has ever

218
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:23,640
broken his records.

219
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:26,550
If he keep staying in the unit,

220
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:27,950
I bet he'll be...

221
00:13:28,770 --> 00:13:29,680
It's just a pity.

222
00:13:31,150 --> 00:13:32,230
Is he harsh on you guys?

223
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,780
He's strict with his trainees and instructors.

224
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:37,740
I've never seen him smile

225
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,870
during the years I've been here.

226
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:40,150
Look,

227
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,210
this scar on my leg

228
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:44,970
was from the beating he gave me before,

229
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:46,450
and it hasn't healed till now.

230
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:54,060
He wouldn't hit female trainees, right?

231
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:54,830
Female trainees?

232
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,120
Why?

233
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:57,580
There are no gender codes in here.

234
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:59,420
Anyone who makes mistakes

235
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,670
can't get away with punishment.

236
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,670
But the situation is getting better now.

237
00:14:03,250 --> 00:14:03,950
If there's something wrong,

238
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:04,970
we'll deal with it first.

239
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:06,290
If it's in the past,

240
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:07,710
the wailing and howling of the trainees

241
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:09,290
would echo through the entire training ground.

242
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,240
That's brutal.

243
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,000
How old is he?

244
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:14,880
Thirty-one.

245
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:16,980
He's only 7 years older than me.

246
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:18,860
But he seems to be from a different generation.

247
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,890
Has he ever had a girlfriend?

248
00:14:22,290 --> 00:14:23,810
I don't think so.

249
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,170
Well, at least not since I joined.

250
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:27,800
It's even more unlikely

251
00:14:27,990 --> 00:14:28,980
when he was in the special forces.

252
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:30,900
Such a manly dude.

253
00:14:31,390 --> 00:14:33,350
Can he endure it if he doesn't have a girlfriend around?

254
00:14:33,450 --> 00:14:34,580
That's not a problem for us.

255
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:35,980
Look around us.

256
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:36,650
Look at this guy

257
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,090
and that one.

258
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:38,280
Even I'm still single.

259
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,600
We're all bachelors.

260
00:14:39,780 --> 00:14:40,530
So it's really nothing.

261
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:42,070
You'll get used to it.

262
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,500
We bodyguards,

263
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,190
especially those senior ones,

264
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:48,410
aren't even allowed to carry phones during regular times.

265
00:14:48,990 --> 00:14:50,330
If we really had girlfriends,

266
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,320
it would be troublesome.

267
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:55,780
Then, did any woman court him before?

268
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:56,980
Court him?

269
00:14:57,150 --> 00:14:58,310
You must be joking.

270
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,230
A man like him

271
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,320
can only be worshiped.

272
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:15,690
Xia Yao.

273
00:15:16,530 --> 00:15:17,900
Not everyone is capable of doing this.

274
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:19,560
I'll show you.

275
00:15:19,990 --> 00:15:20,410
Look closely.

276
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:34,300
What's wrong?

277
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:35,200
Hurry. Quickly.

278
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:35,840
Help me get it down.

279
00:15:35,930 --> 00:15:36,650
Help.

280
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,600
I'm fine.

281
00:15:41,380 --> 00:15:42,430
It would have been a piece of cake

282
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,390
if I were younger.

283
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:45,400
Mr. Yuan.

284
00:15:46,670 --> 00:15:48,500
This is the new trainee I recruited today.

285
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,340
No need to introduce me to him.

286
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:51,180
We know each other.

287
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:52,750
I just met him yesterday, right?

288
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,590
Why didn't you say that to me earlier?

289
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:56,980
Then I'd give you

290
00:15:57,260 --> 00:15:58,090
a 5% discount.

291
00:15:59,070 --> 00:15:59,810
Refund him the money.

292
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:02,510
Refund?

293
00:16:04,030 --> 00:16:05,370
We've already signed the contract.

294
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,750
Besides, I've undergone the physical examination.

295
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,060
I meet all the requirements.

296
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:10,640
Physical examination?

297
00:16:11,190 --> 00:16:11,900
When did that happen?

298
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:13,200
Just now.

299
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,590
I brought him over to the physical examination room

300
00:16:15,940 --> 00:16:17,060
and stripped him bare.

301
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:18,820
He was a little shy in the beginning.

302
00:16:19,420 --> 00:16:20,810
And I was like, we're all guys,

303
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:21,930
it's not a big deal.

304
00:16:22,940 --> 00:16:23,630
Don't you agree?

305
00:16:24,410 --> 00:16:25,710
Why didn't you wait for me to return before conducting the physical examination?

306
00:16:26,330 --> 00:16:28,360
Actually, you only missed a few minutes.

307
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,330
When I shut the examination room's door,

308
00:16:30,430 --> 00:16:31,780
you happened to drive up.

309
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,570
If you got here a few minutes earlier...

310
00:16:33,610 --> 00:16:34,070
Enough.

311
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:35,650
Get on with your work.

312
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:37,580
Why is he snapping at me

313
00:16:37,610 --> 00:16:38,690
over a physical examination?

314
00:16:39,900 --> 00:16:41,690
He doesn't usually act like this.

315
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:45,700
Do you have to join us?

316
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:47,870
Sure.

317
00:16:48,220 --> 00:16:48,900
It's okay if you want to stay.

318
00:16:49,810 --> 00:16:50,820
But I'll be the one teaching you.

319
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,430
I don't need your guidance.

320
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,650
I want the strictest instructor.

321
00:16:57,890 --> 00:16:58,730
Here I am.

322
00:17:06,359 --> 00:17:06,849
Dude.

323
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:08,290
Excuse me,

324
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,150
who's your strictest instructor here?

325
00:17:10,599 --> 00:17:11,460
The one behind you.

326
00:17:15,130 --> 00:17:16,109
How about the second-strictest one?

327
00:17:18,130 --> 00:17:18,880
That would him.

328
00:17:22,210 --> 00:17:22,690
Great.

329
00:17:23,099 --> 00:17:24,210
Then I'll go with Mr. Shi.

330
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,240
He's not available.

331
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:27,730
He's in charge of group training

332
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:29,030
and doesn't provide private courses anymore.

333
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,830
I don't need private training.

334
00:17:31,100 --> 00:17:32,710
I'll train with these fellow bodyguards together.

335
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,730
It's just that I'll have fewer classes than them.

336
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,050
Mr. Shi.

337
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:07,760
Hit harder!

338
00:18:18,310 --> 00:18:20,050
Why... why is he here?

339
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,050
He just singed up yesterday.

340
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,280
What, so you know him?

341
00:18:23,670 --> 00:18:25,770
I-Isn't that Xia Yao?

342
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,650
Focus on your training.

343
00:18:44,740 --> 00:18:45,750
Hit harer.

344
00:18:55,570 --> 00:18:56,720
So he's Xia Yao.

345
00:18:58,120 --> 00:18:58,550
Ugh.

346
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,340
Wow.

347
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,290
He's so handsome.
