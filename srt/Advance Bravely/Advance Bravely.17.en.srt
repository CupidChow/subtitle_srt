[Episode 17]

4
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:23,290
Get off me!

5
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:24,340
What are you guys doing?

6
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:25,890
What do you want to do?

7
00:02:27,050 --> 00:02:27,620
Xia Yao.

8
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,850
This is not your own matter.

9
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:34,090
We have to face it together.

10
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:36,370
These days,

11
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,590
I've seen your efforts

12
00:02:39,290 --> 00:02:41,020
I am regretful for

13
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:42,140
thinking about giving up on you.

14
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:45,100
This time, I won't leave you.

15
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:46,950
I'll wait outside,

16
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:49,600
supporting you quietly to overcome this hurdle.

17
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:50,730
You...

18
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,810
Get off me!

19
00:02:52,829 --> 00:02:53,470
Stop struggling!

20
00:02:55,329 --> 00:02:56,090
Get off me!

21
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:56,850
Stop struggling!

22
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,850
Let me introduce myself.

23
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,650
My surname is Wang.

24
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,980
I have studied male psychology and health

25
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:10,840
for many years.

26
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,940
Under the influence of traditional views,

27
00:03:13,170 --> 00:03:14,830
it's hard for men

28
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:16,350
to relieve their mental stress

29
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:17,950
in an appropriate way.

30
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:18,940
But rest assured.

31
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:20,440
Since I'm here,

32
00:03:20,570 --> 00:03:22,590
I'll provide the best mental support.

33
00:03:22,890 --> 00:03:25,190
You'll completely recover from your illness

34
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:26,980
both mentally and physically.

35
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,420
Then I'll help you forge

36
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,540
a healthy self-image

37
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:30,730
and lifestyle.

38
00:03:31,090 --> 00:03:31,730
Nice to meet you.

39
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,900
I'm

40
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,990
the director of the pre-marriage health commission.

41
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:37,300
I

42
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:40,240
have many years of experience in andrology.

43
00:03:40,650 --> 00:03:43,140
When it comes to erectile dysfunction,

44
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,570
premature ejaculation, gonadal dysfunctions,

45
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:47,420
and other male diseases,

46
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,490
I have rich clinic experience.

47
00:03:50,090 --> 00:03:50,600
Well.

48
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:52,220
I'll conduct a clinical examination for you.

49
00:03:52,329 --> 00:03:53,290
I don't have any issues!

50
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:55,300
Receiving treatment here

51
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:57,530
is better than sneaking to the hospital alone

52
00:03:57,690 --> 00:03:59,090
and suffering the stares of others.

53
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,410
As far as I know,

54
00:04:00,410 --> 00:04:01,290
the bodyguards here

55
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,620
are very professional.

56
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:04,220
They must keep their mouth shut.

57
00:04:04,630 --> 00:04:04,970
They...

58
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:05,530
Shut up!

59
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:07,780
Well.

60
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,210
A check will reveal whether you're sick or not.

61
00:04:10,530 --> 00:04:11,210
You guy.

62
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:18,839
So strong.

63
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:22,650
Mr. Xia.

64
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:25,360
We have built an unbreakable

65
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:28,400
fort for your love!

66
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,330
Where are the others?

67
00:04:57,150 --> 00:04:58,430
They're on leave.

68
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,250
They said

69
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,650
they have a group activity to participate in.

70
00:05:00,670 --> 00:05:02,110
Why don't I know about this activity?

71
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:02,830
Where's Xia Yao?

72
00:05:03,010 --> 00:05:04,140
He went with them.

73
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:06,130
When did Yuan Ru leave?

74
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,880
She seemed to go with Xia Yao.

75
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,830
Sorry, the number you have dialed is unavailable.

76
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:32,490
Where are they having this activity?

77
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:36,250
Do you know where they are?

78
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,170
It seems the address is in my phone.

79
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:41,690
This is it.

80
00:05:43,170 --> 00:05:43,900
Mr. Yuan, have a look.

81
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,520
Keep an eye on things here.

82
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:48,230
I'll be away fro a while.

83
00:05:58,890 --> 00:05:59,810
What are you doing?

84
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:00,410
Please

85
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,110
relax.

86
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:01,900
Don't be scared.

87
00:06:02,250 --> 00:06:03,540
This is acupuncture.

88
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:06,060
These needles are so thin

89
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:08,680
that you won't feel any pain.

90
00:06:08,710 --> 00:06:09,430
No pain.

91
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,500
Get the hell away from me!

92
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,670
You won't feel anything!

93
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:13,790
Not at all!

94
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,170
Not at all!

95
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:19,780
Comfortable, right?

96
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,330
Let's give it another try.

97
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,840
Very comfortable. Ah!

98
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:34,140
How is it?

99
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:35,590
Does it feel good?

100
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,170
How about one more try?

101
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:37,900
Yuan Zong!

102
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:39,140
Come here as soon as possible!

103
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:40,970
Your sister is killing me!

104
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,730
He was such a flirt! Do you know that?

105
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:51,250
Every time

106
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:52,980
he gazes at me,

107
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,970
my heart melts.

108
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:02,080
Why are you here?

109
00:07:02,490 --> 00:07:04,090
Well...

110
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:25,580
What are you doing?

111
00:07:25,780 --> 00:07:26,530
I'm treating his illness!

112
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:03,440
What in the world are you doing?

113
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:05,970
Treating his illness.

114
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:06,960
What illness does he have?

115
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:08,440
Why are you yelling at me?

116
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,070
This is good for him!

117
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:12,580
Rather than making him train so hard every day,

118
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,330
isn't it better to treat the problem with medicine?

119
00:08:14,890 --> 00:08:16,100
Why did you bring so many people with you?

120
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,670
How is he supposed to face others in the team?

121
00:08:20,130 --> 00:08:22,500
They don't know why I brought Xia Yao here.

122
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,120
Do you think I'm an idiot?

123
00:08:24,330 --> 00:08:26,380
I won't blabber about his illness.

124
00:08:26,810 --> 00:08:27,410
What illness does he have?

125
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,790
Listen up.

126
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:30,520
He isn't ill at all.

127
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:32,890
How do you know that he isn't ill?

128
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:36,940
Come over here.

129
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:39,390
Take her away.

130
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,600
Reflect on yourself.

131
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:42,610
Don't touch me.

132
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:44,680
You're not allowed to go out for a week!

133
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,090
I told you to not touch me!

134
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:47,860
Keep an eye on her.

135
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,130
Yes.

136
00:08:58,180 --> 00:08:59,020
You skipped dinner.

137
00:08:59,210 --> 00:09:00,070
Have some fruits.

138
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:01,700
You say.

139
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,840
How am I supposed to survive in this place?

140
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:04,980
It's fine.

141
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,740
They don't know what happened.

142
00:09:07,210 --> 00:09:08,080
They just tagged along for fun.

143
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,970
I don't want to eat pears.

144
00:09:12,670 --> 00:09:14,150
Do they need to know what happened?

145
00:09:14,690 --> 00:09:15,730
A grown man like me

146
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:17,570
was dragged off into a room in secret.

147
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,280
Then two doctors came in.

148
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:21,660
Anyone smart enough would figure it out.

149
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:25,130
I'm here.

150
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,010
No one would dare to talk.

151
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:33,140
Why does my foot feel itchy?

152
00:09:35,850 --> 00:09:36,970
Are you allergic to needles?

153
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:47,450
Don't scratch it.

154
00:09:47,540 --> 00:09:48,290
I'll apply something for you.

155
00:10:09,790 --> 00:10:10,630
No need.

156
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,600
I'll do it myself.

157
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:14,110
It'll burn you.

158
00:10:18,700 --> 00:10:19,940
You're using your hand, too.

159
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,250
No. No. No.

160
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:22,980
You'll be burned.

161
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,640
Hot water works best.

162
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,000
Is it hot?

163
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,020
I'm fine.

164
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,450
My hands are full of calluses.

165
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,230
I'm not sensitive to heat.

166
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,620
He is an experienced herbalist doctor?

167
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:27,090
I think

168
00:11:27,590 --> 00:11:28,800
he is just a quack!

169
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,690
I'm quite regretful now.

170
00:11:37,810 --> 00:11:39,570
Why did I make up that lie?

171
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,480
I dug my own grave.

172
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,650
I thought your sister would figure out my intentions.

173
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,730
How did she end up believing that?

174
00:11:50,180 --> 00:11:50,930
It's hot!

175
00:11:58,090 --> 00:11:58,770
Do you feel better?

176
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,960
It doesn't itch that much.

177
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:06,130
Give me the towel in your hand.

178
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:16,640
Hi.

179
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:33,570
Well.

180
00:12:33,890 --> 00:12:34,850
How to use this?

181
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:35,550
Hold it like this.

182
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:44,200
How does

183
00:12:44,230 --> 00:12:44,830
she look?

184
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,640
I have to pull this.

185
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:47,910
Great.

186
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,780
She has a pretty face.

187
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:53,010
She's here to be matched with Mr. Yuan.

188
00:12:58,810 --> 00:12:59,650
Gird friend?

189
00:13:00,620 --> 00:13:01,460
Who told you that?

190
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:06,970
You don't know that?

191
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:08,780
Yuan Ru introduced her

192
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,450
to Mr. Yuan.

193
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,550
This is her second time here today.

194
00:13:11,580 --> 00:13:12,860
She really found a girl.

195
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:13,720
I think the girl is pretty nice.

196
00:13:14,100 --> 00:13:15,420
I don't even have to waste any effort.

197
00:13:17,250 --> 00:13:18,370
I'll leave first.

198
00:13:18,640 --> 00:13:19,610
Let's meet another day.

199
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,180
There...

200
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:20,900
Nice.

201
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:22,860
There...

202
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,690
There is also nice.

203
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,600
When did you two arrive?

204
00:13:34,380 --> 00:13:35,130
Why didn't you come in?

205
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:40,010
Mr. Yuan.

206
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:40,680
I

207
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,950
am going to play basketball with the guys.

208
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,290
I wouldn't dare enter and ruin your prospects.

209
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,390
She's just one of Yuan Ru's good friend.

210
00:13:54,530 --> 00:13:55,240
Don't bother with the excuses.

211
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,780
Admit the truth like a man.

212
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,690
What do you fear?

213
00:13:59,020 --> 00:13:59,750
Besides,

214
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:00,960
haven't I been talking about

215
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,180
introducing girls to you?

216
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,620
This is perfect.

217
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:06,300
Someone has done the work for me.

218
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:09,010
Your sister always does something annoying,

219
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:10,680
but I'm pleased with

220
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,120
this plan of hers.

221
00:14:12,860 --> 00:14:13,530
Right?

222
00:14:19,710 --> 00:14:20,500
What do you want for dinner?

223
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:22,450
I'm in a fabulous mood today.

224
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:23,440
I want to feast on everything.

225
00:14:23,590 --> 00:14:24,630
Cook a few more dishes.

226
00:14:43,290 --> 00:14:44,330
Yuan Zong is right.

227
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,390
They all don't care about that incident.

228
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,780
Assemble!

229
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:19,750
Today's training will consist of

230
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,610
joint locking techniques and defending against such attacks.

231
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:22,770
First,

232
00:15:23,210 --> 00:15:24,500
remember one point.

233
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,700
Under all circumstances,

234
00:15:26,970 --> 00:15:29,090
you have to avoid deaths and injuries.

235
00:15:29,980 --> 00:15:32,300
Ensuring your client's safety is top priority.

236
00:15:32,650 --> 00:15:34,050
Don't try to be a hero.

237
00:15:34,950 --> 00:15:36,430
So the importance of joint locking techniques

238
00:15:36,780 --> 00:15:37,690
is very obvious.

239
00:15:38,130 --> 00:15:38,690
Next,

240
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,110
we will proceed with one-on-one

241
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,100
joint locking and defense training!

242
00:15:42,620 --> 00:15:43,090
Xia Yao!

243
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:43,560
Yes!

244
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:44,110
Step forward!

245
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,740
Yes!

246
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:48,520
Now

247
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,960
Xia Yao and I

248
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,300
will demonstrate it for everyone.

249
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:04,570
Return to the unit.

250
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:05,250
Yes.

251
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,640
As a bodyguard,

252
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,060
the most important professional conduct

253
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:16,580
is confidence!

254
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,130
No matter what happens,

255
00:16:19,080 --> 00:16:21,030
you have to be confident in your ability to protect your client.

256
00:16:21,940 --> 00:16:22,740
Only thus,

257
00:16:23,280 --> 00:16:24,720
can you intimidate your enemy

258
00:16:25,510 --> 00:16:27,060
and gain the respect of your colleagues.

259
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:28,180
Got it?

260
00:16:28,470 --> 00:16:29,420
Yes.

261
00:16:30,500 --> 00:16:31,220
Prepare for training!

262
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,780
Start!

263
00:16:57,370 --> 00:16:58,570
When will you be done cooking?

264
00:16:59,100 --> 00:16:59,830
If you take any longer,

265
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:00,960
I'll go home for dinner.

266
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,339
[Unread Message]

267
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,339
[An Unread Message]

268
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,520
I'm Wang Shuang.

269
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:27,970
This is my phone number.

270
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:29,160
We can stay in contact.
