97
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:47,710
I was still wondering why Dayu

98
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:49,860

00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:54,850
Turns out

102
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:57,230
to be because of his special preference.

103
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,600

116
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:37,340
Obviously.

117
00:11:38,370 --> 00:11:39,330
Even if you raise a cat

118
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,410

119
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:41,400
you'd feel reluctant to part.

120
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:44,230
That will definitely happen with people.

121
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,060
Habit is truly

122
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:49,310
a monster that devours.

123
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,380
Why did you say that?

124
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:55,280
Never mind.

Oh.

133

134
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,440
I won't meet him.

135
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,700
Sure.

136
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:35,500
I'll get some guys

137
00:12:35,570 --> 00:12:36,970

138
00:12:37,780 --> 00:12:38,560
Hey!

139
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:40,900
Forget it.

140
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:43,500
I'll go.

141
00:12:52,410 --> 00:12:54,080
Actually, there's nothing between Wang Zhishui and me.

142
00:12:55,170 --> 00:12:56,580
I was just drunk.

143
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,130

After that, it's as you saw.

145
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,310
I don't get it.

146
00:13:05,350 --> 00:13:06,890
Why are you always in such situations?

147
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:08,210
What did I do?

148
00:13:10,730 --> 00:13:11,350
Have you forgotten?

149
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:13,460
When we were drunk that night,

150
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,700
I crashed at your place.

151
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:16,440
Didn't the same thing happen?

152
00:13:17,650 --> 00:13:18,880
I was just about to talk about that.

153
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:21,150
I drank too much that day

154
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,420
and mistook you for Wang Zhishui.

155
00:13:22,700 --> 00:13:23,660
That's why I tortured you.

156
00:13:24,750 --> 00:13:25,880
We didn't do anything.

157
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,220
We just got into a fight.

158
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,080
What about the night

159
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:30,510
you were drunk at Wang Zhishui's place?

160
00:13:31,230 --> 00:13:32,550
Who did you mistake him for?

161
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:41,010
Let me tell you something.

162
00:13:42,760 --> 00:13:43,770
You have to promise

163
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:44,880
to keep this a secret.

164
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:45,930
Go on.

165
00:13:49,390 --> 00:13:51,070
I suspect that Wang Zhishui isn't human.

166
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,690
He's a chicken spirit.

167
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:00,610
That's ridiculous.

168
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,650
I wouldn't even dare tell anyone that.

169
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:05,080
A chicken spirit?

170
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:08,000
Stop laughing.

171
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:09,150
Let me finish.

172
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,720
I was drowsy from sleep

173
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,800
when I felt a chicken

174
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:14,740
fly on my head.

175
00:14:15,090 --> 00:14:16,530
After that,

176
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:17,770
I saw Wang Zhishui and that chicken

177
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:20,030
jumping around on the bed.

178
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:22,100
Guess what happened after that.

179
00:14:22,650 --> 00:14:23,920
The chicken vanished.

180
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,470
Both of them fused into one.

181
00:14:26,110 --> 00:14:27,040
Isn't that strange?

182
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,510
Are you sure you weren't dreaming?

183
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:32,830
I thought I was dreaming,

184
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:35,040
but when I woke up in the morning,

185
00:14:35,060 --> 00:14:37,150
I found chicken feathers on the bed.

186
00:14:37,590 --> 00:14:38,600
It was real chicken feathers.

187
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,370
How can there be such a coincidence?

188
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:44,530
This won't do.

189
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:46,410
I have to investigate this.

190
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,600
You're so unbelievable.

191
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:03,540
This weekend,

192
00:15:04,150 --> 00:15:05,790
come and have a meal with my friends.

193
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:08,760
Xuan Dayu again?

194
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:11,940
I've made it clear to him.

195
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:14,010
He...

196
00:15:15,270 --> 00:15:16,240
just has a temper.

Sure.

202
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,630
Did you invite Dayu?

203
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,210
I won't leave him out.

204
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:00,010
I'll call him later.

205
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:00,740
Okay.

Don't forget

208
00:16:04,300 --> 00:16:05,750
to bring your girlfriend along.

209
00:16:07,930 --> 00:16:08,410
Got it.

210
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:09,630
Okay.

211

come to a gathering with me.

216
00:16:51,910 --> 00:16:52,750
Why invite me

217
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:54,030
instead of your girlfriend?

218
00:16:54,900 --> 00:16:56,210
She doesn't want to come.

219
00:16:57,200 --> 00:16:58,100
So I wanted you

220
00:16:58,490 --> 00:16:59,380
to come with me.

221
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,600

00:17:19,079 --> 00:17:20,150
of course.

226
00:17:20,500 --> 00:17:21,690
At 7 p.m., right?

227
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,200
Okay!

228
00:17:28,510 --> 00:17:30,460
Xia Yao called. He wants to have a meal tonight.

229
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,540
What time?

230
00:17:31,570 --> 00:17:32,050
Where?

231
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:32,810
At 7 p.m.

He sent the address over.

233
00:17:37,130 --> 00:17:37,550
Oh, by the way,

234
00:17:37,580 --> 00:17:40,540
Xia Yao asked me to join tonight.

235
00:17:42,380 --> 00:17:43,330
Why should you come?

236
00:17:43,810 --> 00:17:44,770
Why are you butting in?

237
00:17:45,410 --> 00:17:46,640
To make you look good.

238
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:48,980
Are you sure you aren't going to

239
00:17:49,010 --> 00:17:49,850
embarrass me instead?

240
00:17:50,760 --> 00:17:52,100
Xia Yao already invited me.

241
00:17:52,230 --> 00:17:53,270
You can skip the meal,

242
00:17:53,290 --> 00:17:54,770
but you can't stop me from going.

243
00:17:55,250 --> 00:17:55,800
Fine.

244
00:17:56,570 --> 00:17:58,170
I'll pretend I don't know you.

245
00:17:58,700 --> 00:17:59,820
Don't talk to me.

[Chaozhou Restaurant ]

247
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:19,550
I made a reservation.

248
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:20,540
Why didn't you go in?

249
00:18:21,220 --> 00:18:22,380
We were waiting for you.

250
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,550
When have I ever been late?

251
00:18:23,570 --> 00:18:23,990
My idol,

252
00:18:24,010 --> 00:18:25,050
can I have your autograph?

253
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:25,800
My idol,

254
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:27,670
I really love you.

255
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,800
I couldn't bear to cure

256
00:18:29,840 --> 00:18:30,850
the tissue damage you caused.

257
00:18:31,560 --> 00:18:33,060
That was just a misunderstanding.

258
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,800
I threw the tofu at your sister,

259
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:36,320
but I felt really sorry.

260
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:38,230
You dress quite well.

261
00:18:38,680 --> 00:18:39,750
Your taste has improved.

262

I'm here to brag about my wealth.

264
00:18:44,350 --> 00:18:45,010
Huh.

265
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:48,170
I thought he sold that lighter ages ago.

266
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:51,670
I didn't think this money-grubber

267
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:53,220
is finally showing some loyalty.
