Monk Xia.

[Episode 7]

5
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,210
Focus.

6
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:05,220
Put more force in the punches.

7
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:16,390
So he's Xia Yao.

8
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,240
What?

9
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:21,000
Wow,

10
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,790
he's so handsome.

11
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:23,470
Yes,

12
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:24,910
he signed up yesterday.

13
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,800
I stared at him the whole time.

14
00:02:27,150 --> 00:02:29,079
He's quite the handsome guy.

15
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,020
Wow,

16
00:02:30,070 --> 00:02:32,310
Miss Yuan has great taste in men.

17
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:34,300
A real gift from the heavens.

18
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:35,090
All right, go back to training.

19
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:09,340
Up next,

20
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:11,230
you will undergo

21
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:12,580
a ten-minute kidnapping exercise.

22
00:03:12,970 --> 00:03:14,170
When I blow my whistle,

23
00:03:14,750 --> 00:03:15,770
turn around immediately and grab the piece of cloth.

24
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,460
After that,

25
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,060
find any opponent

26
00:03:19,370 --> 00:03:21,430
and tie him up.

27
00:03:22,420 --> 00:03:22,930
Remember this.

28
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,870
You're forbidden from attacking your opponent's

29
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,829
joints and vital organs.

30
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:28,680
You are free to use any other method

31
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:29,720
to subdue your opponent.

32
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:31,560
Understood?

33
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,010
Yes, Sir!

34
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:13,810
Stop yanking!

35
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,670
What are you doing?

36
00:05:19,230 --> 00:05:20,180
He's yanking my shirt!

37
00:05:20,850 --> 00:05:22,380
You promised me this yesterday.

38
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:24,850
You said you'd undergo the same training as these bodyguards.

39
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:26,110
Listen up.

40
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:28,090
As a bodyguard,

41
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,280
you have to sacrifice your dignity.

42
00:05:31,030 --> 00:05:32,560
Your employer's safety is your top priority.

43
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,650
Your self-image is secondary.

44
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:44,800
I'm harsher on you

45
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:47,130
because you're Chief Instructor Yuan's brother-in-law.

46
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,030
I'm not his brother-in-law.

47
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:48,930
I don't care!

48
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:51,170
Since Mr. Yuan permitted you attend to this training camp,

49
00:05:51,370 --> 00:05:52,800
it means he approves of you.

50
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:06,400
Move faster.

51
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,240
What are you doing?

52
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:08,890
Xia Yao!

53
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:10,180
What are you doing?

54
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:10,980
Huh?

55
00:06:11,590 --> 00:06:12,560
Move faster!

56
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,320
What are you doing?

57
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,810
He kicked me first.

58
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,150
I don't care!

59
00:06:17,740 --> 00:06:19,310
You're Chief Instructor Yuan's brother-in-law.

60
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:21,390
That's why you're getting special treatment.

61
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:23,380
Get moving.

62
00:06:24,050 --> 00:06:24,830
Faster!

63
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,490
All of you.

64
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,730
Faster!

65
00:06:33,010 --> 00:06:33,490
Xia Yao!

66
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,300
Move faster.

67
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:49,430
We'll call it a day.

68
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:50,980
You're dismissed.

69
00:06:56,390 --> 00:06:57,460
Xia Yao, stay back.

70
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:02,720
Stand here for an hour as punishment.

71
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:04,840
Why?

72
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:07,080
That's because you're Chief Instructor Yuan's brother-in-law.

73
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,390
In order to elevate his reputation

74
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,370
as an impartial man,

75
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:13,300
you will get the special attention.

76
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,720
Let me tell you again.

77
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,960
I'm not related to him in any way.

78
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:18,920
I came here

79
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,440
to improve myself.

80
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,250
Another hour

81
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:22,280
for talking back at your instructor.

82
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:45,480
Why haven't I seen Mr. Yuan today?

83
00:07:46,220 --> 00:07:47,010
I don't know.

84
00:07:47,050 --> 00:07:47,890
Did he head out?

85
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:48,810
No,

86
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,760
he's been in his office the entire time.

87
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:50,670
That's unlike him.

88
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,050
All right.

89
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:23,970
In the video we just watched,

90
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:25,300
each move and technique

91
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,770
were explained clearly.

92
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,730
In the field,

93
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:30,750
keen observation

94
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:31,800
and swift judgment

95
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:33,640
will help you locate an enemy's weakness in the shortest time.

96
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:35,140
Only then can you subdue your opponent successfully.

97
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,289
All right,

98
00:08:37,590 --> 00:08:38,900
our lesson ends here today.

99
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:39,940
Dismissed.

100
00:08:48,130 --> 00:08:48,460
Hey,

101
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:48,880
Xia Yao.

102
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:50,470
Mr. Yuan wants to see you in his office.

103
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,310
Okay.

104
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:28,550
Do I eat these or not?

105
00:09:31,780 --> 00:09:32,290
Xia Yao,

106
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:33,120
what are you doing?

107
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,080
Mr. Yuan called me over.

108
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:43,010
Your brother-in-law sure went to extents for you.

109
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:45,140
He's pulling such tricks

110
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:46,760
to train your willpower.

111
00:09:50,220 --> 00:09:50,760
Mr. Yuan.

112
00:09:51,670 --> 00:09:52,680
Your brother-in-law is impressive.

113
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:53,980
He resisted the temptation.

114
00:10:33,700 --> 00:10:34,220
Brother,

115
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:35,850
training ended really early today.

116
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:37,780
It's not done yet.

117
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,640
They've just gone to shower and change.

118
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,210
Shower?

119
00:10:42,430 --> 00:10:43,320
Has Xia Yao gone as well?

120
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:45,710
Of course,

121
00:10:46,260 --> 00:10:47,120
he's part of the training program.

122
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:50,970
Xia Yao...

123
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,210
Hold on.

124
00:10:57,010 --> 00:10:58,770
He's not taking the shower

125
00:10:58,810 --> 00:11:00,190
in the common bathroom with the rest, is he?

126
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,860
No...

127
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,820
Yao's body is a national treasure.

128
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:09,600
How can those guys feast their eyes on him?

129
00:11:10,450 --> 00:11:10,860
Brother,

130
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:11,810
listen to me.

131
00:11:11,850 --> 00:11:14,000
Don't think it's okay just because they're all guys.

132
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,340
When it comes to Xia Yao,

133
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,960
no logic applies.

134
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:18,660
Women aren't the only threats.

135
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,910
Even men have to be kept at a distance.

136
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,180
Xia Yao's charms work on both genders.

137
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:26,920
That's why...

138
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:29,480
I can't

139
00:11:29,510 --> 00:11:30,700
manage it all alone.

140
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:32,660
Brother,

141
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,980
you have to help me.

142
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:49,680
Hey.

143
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:50,150
Hello.

144
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:52,340
Mr. Yuan prepared a private bathroom for you.

145
00:11:52,370 --> 00:11:52,970
Come with me.

146
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,050
Where are you going?

147
00:11:57,580 --> 00:11:59,030
Special treatment again?

148
00:12:00,530 --> 00:12:02,200
Mr. Yuan's reputation as a just and fair man

149
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:03,810
can't be tarnished by you.

150
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,960
Don't try to be a smart-ass.

151
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:08,290
Ignore him.

152
00:12:08,770 --> 00:12:10,260
Let's shower in the common bathroom.

153
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:10,820
Hey!

154
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:38,850
Why are you showering with a towel?

155
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:40,590
We're all guys.

156
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:41,900
We have what you have.

157
00:12:42,330 --> 00:12:42,880
Huh?

158
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,750
What's this nonsense?

159
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,340
Knock it off.

160
00:12:57,450 --> 00:12:59,360
Why do you even visit us in the bathroom?

161
00:13:00,850 --> 00:13:02,340
This never happened before.

162
00:13:28,420 --> 00:13:29,000
Your training

163
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:31,090
has been tough lately.

164
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:33,420
The results of such training is evident.

165
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,260
However,

166
00:13:35,560 --> 00:13:37,510
there are also areas of improvement.

167
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,100
This applies

168
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,840
especially to the training of newcomers.

169
00:13:42,750 --> 00:13:44,250
You can't lower your standards of someone

170
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:45,810
because he's new.

171
00:13:47,080 --> 00:13:47,520
Instructor Shi

172
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:48,960
has done excellently

173
00:13:49,250 --> 00:13:50,100
in this aspect.

174
00:13:50,990 --> 00:13:51,960
He views

175
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:52,880
all trainees equally and does his duties

176
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,350
to the best of his abilities.

177
00:13:54,840 --> 00:13:55,660
I'm pleased with his performance.

178
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,110
Instructor Shi

179
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:58,320
should be your role model.

180
00:14:05,790 --> 00:14:06,580
Thank you, Mr. Pu.

181
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,510
You're welcome.

182
00:14:25,380 --> 00:14:26,650
Twenty.

183
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,940
Th-This isn't right.

184
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,150
My monthly bonus should be ¥5,000.

185
00:14:31,330 --> 00:14:32,530
You only gave me ¥2,000.

186
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:36,810
It's right.

187
00:14:37,110 --> 00:14:38,890
I checked again, and it's ¥2,000.

188
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:41,790
Why?

189
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:48,620
Mr. Yuan,

190
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:50,680
what's going on?

191
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:53,290
I didn't violate any rules.

192
00:14:53,700 --> 00:14:54,680
Neither did I leave early or show up late.

193
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:55,940
You even

194
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,030
praised me this morning.

195
00:14:58,330 --> 00:14:59,060
Why did I...

196
00:14:59,970 --> 00:15:01,010
My praises are the reason.

197
00:15:02,610 --> 00:15:03,980
Every word is worth its weight in gold, got it?

198
00:15:05,190 --> 00:15:06,230
I showered you with praises.

199
00:15:06,860 --> 00:15:08,070
That should've been worth ¥3,000.

200
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,800
Dayu,

201
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,360
we haven't seen each other for ages!

202
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,500
Did you even miss me?

203
00:15:51,500 --> 00:15:52,840
Of course, I missed you.

204
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,180
I've been looking for you for ages.

205
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:56,040
You didn't even tell us when you were leaving.

206
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,380
Not even a call.

207
00:15:57,770 --> 00:15:58,400
That's a lie;

208
00:15:58,420 --> 00:15:59,460
it has been years.

209
00:15:59,750 --> 00:16:00,790
If you wanted to see me,

210
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:01,750
you would have found me ages go.

211
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,010
Come on.

212
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,330
Hey,

213
00:16:10,270 --> 00:16:12,280
you weren't this cute during our school days

214
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,390
Why are you getting more youthful by the day?

215
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:15,590
I take good care of myself.

216
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:18,310
Tell me the truth...

217
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:19,320
You know what?

218
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:20,800
He's vegetarian.

219
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:22,510
Get lost.

220
00:16:22,510 --> 00:16:23,330
Don't spout nonsense.

221
00:16:24,630 --> 00:16:25,310
Not bad.

222
00:16:25,310 --> 00:16:26,000
By the way...

223
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:28,450
Why didn't you bring your girl?

224
00:16:29,010 --> 00:16:30,020
I don't have one.

225
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:33,150
Girls should be swarming around you.

226
00:16:33,570 --> 00:16:34,520
How can you be single?

227
00:16:36,070 --> 00:16:36,750
It's not that

228
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,910
he's on a break,

229
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:39,280
he never had one.

230
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:40,950
For many years,

231
00:16:41,130 --> 00:16:42,820
he's been enjoying

232
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:44,310
his bachelorhood as a prince.

233
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,780
He takes his bird on strolls by the river every day.

234
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,820
When a babe tries to court him,

235
00:16:48,840 --> 00:16:50,230
he doesn't even take a glance.

236
00:16:50,230 --> 00:16:51,150
What a virtuous man.

237
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,730
Really?

238
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:57,280
When we were in school,

239
00:16:57,390 --> 00:16:58,550
he was the most eager one.

240
00:16:58,760 --> 00:16:59,920
He was just a kid

241
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:01,470
when he tried to hit on girls

242
00:17:01,630 --> 00:17:02,610
and lift their skirts.

243
00:17:02,940 --> 00:17:03,990
Didn't he do all that?

244
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:05,180
He was

245
00:17:05,630 --> 00:17:06,720
just being a troublemaker.

246
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,930
Let's drink!

247
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,109
Cheers, troublemaker.

248
00:17:10,230 --> 00:17:11,550
If you don't drink till you drop,

249
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:12,510
don't think about leaving.

250
00:17:12,510 --> 00:17:13,470
Your drinks are on me.

251
00:17:13,470 --> 00:17:14,270
-Drink up!
-You know what?

252
00:17:14,270 --> 00:17:16,200
I really needed someone to pick up my tab.

253
00:17:16,829 --> 00:17:17,940
I'll let you pay for us today.

254
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:19,079
Nothing scares me

255
00:17:19,310 --> 00:17:19,950
in Guanghua Street.

256
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:20,970
Bottoms up.

257
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,270
How are your parents?

258
00:17:32,440 --> 00:17:33,270
Same old.

259
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:33,940
His dad

260
00:17:34,670 --> 00:17:36,340
was recently transferred

261
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:37,930
to another province.

262
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,830
When did that happen?

263
00:17:39,180 --> 00:17:40,020
Two years ago.

264
00:17:40,850 --> 00:17:43,000
So do you live with your mom?

265
00:17:43,190 --> 00:17:43,780
No,

266
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:45,510
I only go back home

267
00:17:45,510 --> 00:17:46,530
during the long holidays.

268
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,420
When my dad returns to Beijing for meetings,

269
00:17:49,510 --> 00:17:50,980
he'll stay at home for a few nights.

270
00:17:52,190 --> 00:17:53,860
He comes back once or twice every month.

271
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:54,940
Hey, Dayu.

272
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,580
Why did your family move away so quickly back then?

273
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,010
Right.

274
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,100
My family...

275
00:18:01,340 --> 00:18:02,650
had some issues.

276
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:04,500
Actually, I still don't quite understand

277
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,350
what happened.

278
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:05,830
Forget it.

279
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:07,540
-Drink up.
-Let's drink.

280
00:18:07,540 --> 00:18:08,230
Come on.

281
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,290
Such terrible dancing.

282
00:18:23,650 --> 00:18:25,000
I will give them a show.

283
00:18:53,190 --> 00:18:54,560
Is he really single?

284
00:18:55,380 --> 00:18:56,270
He is really single, no girlfriend.

285
00:18:56,470 --> 00:18:57,310
Everyone in his company

286
00:18:57,310 --> 00:18:59,470
calls him

287
00:18:59,670 --> 00:19:00,870
Monk Xia.

288
00:19:01,430 --> 00:19:02,430
Monk Xia.

289
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,670
Namo Amitabha.

290
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,090
Come on, let's have a drink.

291
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,030
To the monk?

292
00:19:16,190 --> 00:19:17,710
Look, he's having the time of his life.

293
00:19:37,830 --> 00:19:38,950
Can you two keep your distance?
