[Episode 21]

4
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:09,810
Did you find anything?

5
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:16,810
Look at how horrible his relations are.

6
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:21,730
His terrible personality

7
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:22,870
reflects his family.

8
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:24,340
What a jerk.

9
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:27,190
How about...

10
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:28,990
we go to his eldest uncle's house and ask about him?

11
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:31,260
His uncle's house is easy to find,

12
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,310
it's right at the northern end of this village.

13
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,060
Okay.

14
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:37,420
Let's go.

15
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,380
Go.

16
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:51,829
Hello,

17
00:02:52,090 --> 00:02:53,090
can I ask you about someone?

18
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:54,690
Who are you?

19
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:55,840
We are...

20
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:59,040
Excuse me, are you Wang Zhishui's aunt?

21
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,860
What do you want?

22
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,190
We're here to look for Wang Zhishui.

23
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:04,670
We don't know where he lives,

24
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:05,390
so we were hoping you could help us.

25
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:07,900
If you know this house,

26
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:09,440
you can't be clueless about his house.

27
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:11,700
We really don't know,

28
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,150
so we're here asking.

29
00:03:13,740 --> 00:03:14,340
I don't know.

30
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:14,900
I don't know either.

31
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,380
Hey.

32
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:15,790
Get lost!

33
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:16,970
Hey!

34
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:25,500
What should we do?

35
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:26,650
I'm telling you,

36
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:28,420
there must be something wrong with their family.

37
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:31,620
It's unlikely that we'll be able to find his hous

38
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:32,710
with the help of the villagers.

39
00:03:35,079 --> 00:03:35,760
It seems like

40
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,980
we'll have to go to the village committee.

41
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:39,750
Let's go.

42
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:52,840
Thank goodness the village committee was helpful.

43
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,450
We would have wasted this trip if they refused to help.

44
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:57,920
This should be the place.

45
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,260
Let's take a look.

46
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,120
I guess no one's home.

47
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:26,890
Hey, young man!

48
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:28,060
Stop knocking.

49
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:30,140
This house has been empty for ages.

50
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:32,140
I heard that

51
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:33,000
they've been hospitalized.

52
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:37,420
Hospital fees are expensive.

53
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,740
Dying is a far better option.

54
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:40,900
What?

55
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,180
They've been hospitalized?

56
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,300
What on earth did this family do

57
00:04:47,330 --> 00:04:48,370
that's so morally unacceptable?

58
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,659
You guys must be clueless.

59
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,120
I'll tell you.

60
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,480
Li Chunqing

61
00:04:53,640 --> 00:04:54,650
and Wang Kaicai,

62
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:55,700
they were both part of

63
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:56,980
the local troupe

64
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:57,790
when they were young,

65
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,610
that kind of brass theatrical troupe.

66
00:05:00,140 --> 00:05:02,370
Whenever there was a funeral, they would go and perform.

67
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:03,930
Wang Kaicai

68
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,090
was a drag performer.

69
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:06,510
Li Chunqing

70
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:07,770
was a dancer.

71
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,820
You know, that kind of dance.

72
00:05:11,980 --> 00:05:12,850
What kind of dance?

73
00:05:13,450 --> 00:05:14,420
That kind of dance.

74
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,460
What do you mean?

75
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,020
Well, you know,

76
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,910
it's that kind of dance.

77
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:20,440
What kind of dance exactly?

78
00:05:26,270 --> 00:05:27,030
Strip dance.

79
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,090
Yeah.

80
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,950
He's right.

81
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:31,460
Anyway, that woman was so shameless.

82
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,330
She was always

83
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:33,890
trying to seduce men.

84
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,440
She gave birth once.

85
00:05:35,590 --> 00:05:37,050
But who knows whose child she gave birth to?

86
00:05:38,140 --> 00:05:39,340
When her son was 2 years old,

87
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,909
she made her son perform circus tricks

88
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:41,870
on stage.

89
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:43,820
Do you know how her mother-in-law died?

90
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,860
She abused her mother-in-law

91
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:47,300
all the time.

92
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,500
She's not filial at all.

93
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,550
In our courtyard,

94
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:50,860
we often heard her mother-in-law

95
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:52,490
making a fuss,

96
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:53,700
crying and causing a scene.

97
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,940
It disturbed our sleep so much that,

98
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:55,920
at that time,

99
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:57,140
I was almost on the verge of being neurotic.

100
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,690
Let me tell you,

101
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,790
the old lady hanged herself.

102
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:02,510
What?

103
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,270
She hung from the door frame

104
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:06,080
of her grandson's room.

105
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,880
Poor kid.

106
00:06:07,950 --> 00:06:10,040
The old lady brought that boy up all by herself.

107
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:11,990
What wrong

108
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,200
did that kid ever do?

109
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:15,060
Why did she torture him like that?

110
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:16,810
I don't get it.

111
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:21,610
Later, Wang Kaicai

112
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:22,630
ran away.

113
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:24,370
What about Li Chunqing?

114
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,580
She fell terribly ill.

115
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,520
Their house

116
00:06:27,550 --> 00:06:28,750
stinks like hell.

117
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:29,840
You can't even stand the smell.

118
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:31,640
Her kid doesn't even come home often.

119
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,330
His mom is sick, but he doesn't come to visit her.

120
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:34,560
Humph.

121
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,100
You know what? Li Chunqing

122
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,370
deserves this.

123
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,560
It's called karma.

124
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:41,909
In this village,

125
00:06:41,909 --> 00:06:42,860
everyone,

126
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,540
every villager

127
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:44,420
hates that woman.

128
00:06:44,730 --> 00:06:46,210
She's committed all sorts of evil deeds.

129
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:48,500
This is retribution for her wrong doings.

130
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,290
Humph.

131
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:52,100
Everyone gets angry

132
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:53,570
at the mention of her name.

133
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:56,520
Do you get it now?

134
00:07:19,430 --> 00:07:20,300
I don't think he's a

135
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,070
hardened thief.

136
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:23,890
Look,

137
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:25,420
he learned circus tricks from a young age.

138
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:27,250
I bet he's a nimble guy.

139
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,360
Didn't you hear that woman?

140
00:07:35,290 --> 00:07:36,650
He hates his mom.

141
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:38,840
He definitely didn't steal to pay his mom's medical bills.

142
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,280
Maybe he wants the money to fool around with women and gamble.

143
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:45,770
That's none of my business.

144
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:47,950
Will you continue going after him?

145
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,870
His grandma saved him.

146
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:00,580
I'll leave him be.

[Yuan Zong]

148
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,919
Why are you calling me?

149
00:08:44,870 --> 00:08:46,520
I'm checking if you're still alive.

150
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:48,750
How is it over there?

151
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:50,800
Cold.

152
00:08:51,250 --> 00:08:53,210
I never thought you'd be afraid of the cold.

153
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:54,680
I'm not.

154
00:08:55,210 --> 00:08:56,570
I want you to know how cold I'm feeling.

155
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:00,430
Are you trying to add to my joy?

156
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:03,970
You sound like you're in a great mood.

157
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,200
Do I?

158
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:08,580
Haven't I always been like this?

159
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:10,010
What mischief were you up to again?

160
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,830
What could I possibly have done?

161
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,200
Besides,

162
00:09:13,910 --> 00:09:14,910
even if I'm up to no good,

163
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:16,580
that's none of your business.

164
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:18,030
Then, who's supposed to intervene then?

165
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:19,180
I'll punish myself.

166
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:21,210
Did you?

167
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,010
I wasn't up to no good.

168
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:25,320
Why should I punish myself?

169
00:09:29,580 --> 00:09:30,580
It's so cold! So cold!

170
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:32,530
Is that your sister?

171
00:09:32,770 --> 00:09:33,230
Yeah.

172
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,340
Brother.

173
00:09:34,340 --> 00:09:35,430
Who are you talking to on the phone?

174
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:37,260
Is it Xia Yao?

175
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,050
He already hung up the phone.

176
00:09:59,750 --> 00:10:00,750
Here we go.

177
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:02,740
Your dad's specialties are here!

178
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,390
Oh.

179
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:03,980
Thanks, Auntie.

180
00:10:03,980 --> 00:10:04,670
Thanks, Auntie.

181
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:05,610
Auntie, take it easy.

182
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:07,100
Hey.

183
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:07,500
Peng,

184
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,180
eat more.

185
00:10:08,180 --> 00:10:08,700
I will.

186
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,930
Don't worry, Auntie.

187
00:10:10,190 --> 00:10:10,740
It's nothing.

188
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,700
Come on, try this dish my mom made.

189
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,110
It's delicious.

190
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,180
Auntie is even prettier now.

191
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,960
Get me some of that.

192
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:15,430
