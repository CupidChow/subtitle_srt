I'm checking if I bit your ears and injured you.

193
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:47,170
When did you bite my ears?

194
00:13:48,190 --> 00:13:49,230
Last night after I drank wine.

195
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,590
I vaguely remember biting your ears.

196
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:53,480
Seemingly, I bit down quite hard.

197
00:13:53,790 --> 00:13:55,000
When I woke up in this morning,

198
00:13:55,780 --> 00:13:57,050
my mouth tasted blood.

199
00:13:57,310 --> 00:13:58,940
I thought I broke your ears,

200
00:13:59,420 --> 00:14:00,400
and I rushed over to check on you.

201
00:14:01,110 --> 00:14:01,630
No.

202
00:14:01,820 --> 00:14:03,230
My ears don't hurt.

203
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:04,980
If you really bit me,

204
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,260
I would have lost a piece of flesh.

205
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,770
Well, who did I bite?

206
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:12,760
I remember that it was you who carried me home last night.

207
00:14:13,190 --> 00:14:14,120
On the way back...

208
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,520
Don't mention about last night.

209
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:17,770
Last night, the person I carried was not you.

210
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:19,530
Impossible.

211
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,060
If it was not you,

212
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:22,740
who sent me back home?

213
00:14:23,180 --> 00:14:24,690
I remember it clearly.

214
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:27,000
You carried me out of the club.

215
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:27,900
Yes.

216
00:14:28,370 --> 00:14:29,920
I also remember that you were the one on my back!

217
00:14:30,350 --> 00:14:32,020
When I dragged myself home and put you down on the bed,

218
00:14:32,750 --> 00:14:33,630
it was someone else!

219
00:14:35,030 --> 00:14:35,710
What do you mean?

220
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:46,350
That's unbelievable.

221
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,960
Did anyone target you before?

222
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:50,220
No way.

223
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,110
I just returned to Beijing days ago.

224
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,360
A petty thief like him

225
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:55,410
isn't that capable.

226
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:57,990
Is his name really Wang Zhishui?

227
00:14:58,560 --> 00:14:59,160
Of course.

228
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:00,620
I saw his identity card.

229
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:04,950
Why are you laughing?

230
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,590
Stop.

231
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:11,160
If you didn't carry me,

232
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,590
who took me home?

233
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,560
Was it Peng Ze?

234
00:15:17,520 --> 00:15:18,190
No.

235
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:19,940
He left before us.

236
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:23,010
I remember clearly

237
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,000
that I bit someone's ear.

238
00:15:26,620 --> 00:15:27,440
It felt

239
00:15:27,660 --> 00:15:28,540
too real.

240
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:30,960
Maybe that is your dream.

241
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,370
If you really bit someone

242
00:15:32,530 --> 00:15:33,570
with your teeth,

243
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,820
your victim would have come for revenge by now.

244
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:38,260
I hope so.

245
00:15:42,810 --> 00:15:44,600
You lost such a fortune.

246
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:47,130
Do you need to make a police report?

247
00:15:47,170 --> 00:15:47,930
No need.

248
00:15:48,170 --> 00:15:48,990
It's embarrassing.

249
00:15:49,710 --> 00:15:50,900
If you have time,

250
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:52,110
look into this guy for me.

251
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:54,260
I must catch this guy.

252
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:57,610
Tomorrow is the weekend.

253
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,340
Hang out with me.

254
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,640
I signed up for a short-term bodyguard training session.

255
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:02,940
Tomorrow,

256
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:03,810
I have to go for training.

257
00:16:04,190 --> 00:16:05,240
Bodyguard training?

258
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,110
Do you want to become a bodyguard?

259
00:16:08,550 --> 00:16:09,130
No.

260
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,440
That training

261
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:11,560
doesn't have a specific goal.

262
00:16:12,330 --> 00:16:13,010
I'm interested in

263
00:16:13,030 --> 00:16:14,410
their reconnaissance skills

264
00:16:14,520 --> 00:16:16,140
and anti-terrorism training.

265
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:17,780
They also have lessons on

266
00:16:18,070 --> 00:16:18,610
tracking,

267
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:19,250
arresting,

268
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,130
and explosive defense.

269
00:16:20,690 --> 00:16:21,510
It's really thrilling.

270
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,460
Let me join you.

271
00:16:24,910 --> 00:16:26,080
Why?

272
00:16:26,500 --> 00:16:27,200
No particular reason.

273
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:29,620
I just want to spend more time with you.

274
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:26,800
