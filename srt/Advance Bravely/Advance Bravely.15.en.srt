00:02:03,450 --> 00:02:04,410
You don't like her,

5
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:06,270
what's the point of keep her hanging?

6
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:07,890
Do you want to feel annoyed?

7
00:02:10,590 --> 00:02:11,590
I thought you were your sister's white knight.

8
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,170
Since when you started standing in my shoes?

9
00:02:15,710 --> 00:02:16,920
It's not just your shoes.

10
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:18,310
I'm doing what's best for both of you.

11
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:20,120
You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make it drink

12
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:22,030
Since there's no possibility between the two of you

13
00:02:22,680 --> 00:02:23,320
it's better to help her

14
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:24,990
let go of this idea sooner.

15
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:34,670
My back is itchy.

16
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:35,770
Scratch it for me.

17
00:03:53,990 --> 00:03:54,630
Well done.

00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,220
Go! Go!

19
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:17,430
Awesome.

20
00:04:19,899 --> 00:04:20,310
Come on.

21
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:27,220
Nice.

22
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:45,220
Nice.

23
00:04:47,790 --> 00:04:48,190
That's enough.

Well done.

26
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:56,340
You're all doing well now,

27
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,840
but compared to me,

28
00:04:58,310 --> 00:04:59,350
you still have a long way to go.

29
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:00,510
So,

30
00:05:01,040 --> 00:05:02,750
you must train even harder.

31
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:03,960

Mr. Xia,

we only have a five-minute break,

38
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,060
and you're spending it taking care of your bird?

39
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,420
Of course.

40
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,350
Someone has to do it.

41
00:05:35,030 --> 00:05:36,960
Does this bird feel stuffy

42
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:37,810
being cooped up in a cage all day?

43
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:39,540
How about you let it out for a bit?

44
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,820
What if it flies away and never comes back?

45
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:43,520
I don't think so.

46
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:45,070
My cousin's parrot goes for a stroll every day

47
00:05:45,090 --> 00:05:46,620
almost every day,

48
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,450
and it simply perches on my cousin's husband's shoulder

49
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:49,630
without flying around.

50
00:05:50,150 --> 00:05:52,830
I think you should instill that same sense of awareness in it.

51
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:02,470
Good luck. Have a safe trip.

52
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,230

You don't like the taste?

58
00:06:29,910 --> 00:06:30,640
It's too greasy.

59
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:34,030
I brought this from home.

Ensuring the safety of clients

63
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:57,890
involves three primary categories.

64
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,240
firstly,

65
00:06:59,850 --> 00:07:00,950
safeguarding the important individuals.

66
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:02,270
Secondly,

67

securing significant venues.

68
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:05,110
And thirdly,

I'll delve into each of these points in detail for all of you.

72

The first one,

73
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,510
safeguarding the important individuals.

74
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,940
Protecting important individuals

75
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:17,400
goes beyond safeguarding their physical well-being.

76
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:19,860
At certain levels...

77
00:07:19,990 --> 00:07:20,590
Food.

78
00:07:20,630 --> 00:07:21,890
the privacy of these clients

79
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:23,400
can be just as crucial as their safety itself.

80
00:07:23,420 --> 00:07:23,900
Food.

81
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:24,890

Food.

87
00:07:34,310 --> 00:07:36,500
requires early access to it.

88
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:37,360
This is way too unusual.

89
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:37,960

Come on.

97
00:07:47,310 --> 00:07:47,960
Come on.

98
00:07:51,130 --> 00:07:52,040
negotiable notes,

99
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:55,240
and even vital contracts belonging to the clients.

100
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:58,060
For these individuals,

101
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,880
such assets are often more important  than their own lives.

102
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,160
Where did you hide my tablet?

103
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:16,780
Give it back.

104
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,570
Write a self-critique to me,

105
00:08:20,090 --> 00:08:21,010
and once it's approved, I'll return it to you.

106
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,040
You do know it's 21st century now, right? Why do you ask me to write self-critiques?

107
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:26,530
Such a boomer.

108
00:08:28,710 --> 00:08:29,200
Just write it.

109
00:08:30,030 --> 00:08:30,530

110
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:32,010
then you won't get to eat.

It's not a big deal.

113
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:38,240
Is your pride that important?

114
00:08:38,860 --> 00:08:39,840
You're a man,

115
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:40,770
you should be generous.

116
00:08:42,940 --> 00:08:44,330
It's not about my pride.

117
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:51,120
Then what is it?

118
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,480
Didn't you say you bought that durian for me?

119
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,590
Is that what's bothering you?

120
00:09:16,940 --> 00:09:17,670
Oh boy.

How about I introduce a girl to you?

128

didn't you notice all those female trainees staring at you?

131

That will be such a shocking image.

Even the thought of it gets me excited.

138
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,050
Go away.

139

148
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:44,520
This isn't sour.

149
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:45,760
It gets sweeter as you eat it.

150
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:47,460
Try one for yourself.

151

Please, make sure the game saving works,

154
00:12:14,910 --> 00:12:16,750
otherwise, all that effort earlier would be for nothing.

155
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:18,440
What's wrong?

156
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,850
I shouldn't have trusted Xuan Dayu.

157
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,490
He told me that this console could handle quality games.

158
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,060
But it ended up lagging and causing me to lose the game data!

159
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:34,240
What a waste of time!

160
00:12:37,430 --> 00:12:38,090
I'm so pissed off.

161

What's the point of playing this game all day long?

162
00:12:53,550 --> 00:12:54,430
You don't get it.

When I was in the army,

164
00:12:57,550 --> 00:12:59,070
electronic devices were strictly prohibited,

165
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:00,870
especially for me as a sniper.

166
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,430
Visual protection was very important.

167
00:13:03,790 --> 00:13:05,460
It's been years since you left the army.

168
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,460
Why haven't you kept up with the times?

169
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,120
It can't be that the tablet was malfunctioned yesterday

170
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:53,300
and fixed itself today.

171
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:57,470
No, there's something wrong.

That's expensive.
