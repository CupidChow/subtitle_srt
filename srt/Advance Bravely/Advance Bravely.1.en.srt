00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:21,210
I believe

13
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:24,579
we will witness more than a show of fists and strength.

14
00:02:24,579 --> 00:02:25,220
This is also

15
00:02:25,310 --> 00:02:28,460
a competition of endurance and wits!

Let's welcome them to the arena!

20
00:02:39,579 --> 00:02:40,610
That was an impressive hook.

21
00:02:40,610 --> 00:02:41,940
That was extremely...

22
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:42,700
That was definitely a fierce move.

23
00:02:42,700 --> 00:02:43,540
A very fierce move.

24
00:03:07,390 --> 00:03:08,740
That American is quite aggressive.

25
00:03:08,780 --> 00:03:09,180

The ones who entered the arena

29
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,660
were severely beaten up by that American.

30
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,140
I bet the remaining three

31
00:03:15,320 --> 00:03:16,060

It's just a cocktail party.

96

Do you feel particularly embarrassed to meet people?

97
00:07:11,900 --> 00:07:13,200
I would do more than attend a cocktail party

98
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,110
if I had your looks.

99
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,000
I would gladly invite myself

100
00:07:17,410 --> 00:07:18,230

I didn't hear anything.

107

Xia Yao,

114
00:08:21,530 --> 00:08:22,890
it's mimicking my speech.

115
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:24,700
It's mimicking my speech.

116
00:08:24,890 --> 00:08:25,840
It's mimicking my speech.

117
00:08:26,030 --> 00:08:26,960
Bark like a dog.

118
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:28,130
Woof!

119
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,040
Say Peng Ze.

120
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:31,770
Now.

121
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:32,309
Repeat after me.

00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:34,669
Adding red beans into a dice of bone.

123
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,320
Adding red beans into a dice of bone.

124
00:08:38,070 --> 00:08:38,460
Xia Yao,

125
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,730
it's so clever.

126
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:41,549
So clever.

127
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:43,340
I'm going buy a few when I get home.

128
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:44,670
It's so cute.

129
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:46,030
It's so cute.

130
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:48,210
It even mimics what I say.

131
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,860
Xia Yao,

132
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:53,070
I'm begging you.

133
00:08:53,650 --> 00:08:55,050
I already promised Dou

134
00:08:55,090 --> 00:08:56,340
I would get you to go.

135
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:57,490
If you don't show up,

136
00:08:58,310 --> 00:08:59,600
I'll be humiliated.

137
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,200
Yuan Ru is attending as well.

138
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:06,840
All the more reason for me not to go.

139
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,360
Why?

140
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,790
That beauty from Northeast China is wonderful.

141
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,030
She has big boobs

142
00:09:13,110 --> 00:09:13,880
and long legs.

143
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,540
Why aren't you the slightest bit interested?

144
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:21,920
This meal is on me.

145
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,930
You guys can have fun.

146
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:26,050
Thank Dou for me.

147
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,270
Tell him that I'm tired after the match.

148
00:09:29,180 --> 00:09:29,900
We can

149
00:09:29,980 --> 00:09:30,740
have a gathering

150
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:31,630

152
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,740
Please, I'm begging you!

153
00:09:39,010 --> 00:09:40,010
What if I respect you like my grandpa?

154
00:09:40,490 --> 00:09:40,930
Yes?

155
00:10:14,850 --> 00:10:15,490
Mr. Wang.

156
00:10:16,140 --> 00:10:16,810
Are you taking a walk?

157
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:17,820
Yes, I'm taking a walk

158
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:18,780
to help my digestion.

159
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:20,220
Great.

160
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:21,190
See you.

161
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:22,140
Take care.

162
00:10:30,960 --> 00:10:31,530
Yao.

163
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,030
Auntie Li.

164
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,380
Where did you get this bird?

165
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,550
I've never seen it before.

166
00:10:36,050 --> 00:10:36,930
I bought it recently.

167
00:10:38,620 --> 00:10:39,950
These days, few youngsters

168
00:10:40,100 --> 00:10:41,460
have elegant hobbies

169
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,530
like you do.

170
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,740
But you shouldn't be so preoccupied with walking your bird.

171
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:48,130
It's about time you got married.

172
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:49,470
You're such a great catch.

173
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,700
It doesn't seem right

174
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,010
for you to be single.

175
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,280
Lower your standards.

176
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:56,090
If someone suitable comes along, give it a shot.

177
00:10:56,580 --> 00:10:57,130
I'm not in a rush.

178
00:10:57,770 --> 00:10:58,770
Why aren't you in a rush?

179
00:10:58,820 --> 00:10:59,740
How old are you?

180
00:11:00,060 --> 00:11:01,220
At least twenty-six, right?

181
00:11:01,390 --> 00:11:01,840
Umm,

182
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:02,540
Auntie Li,

183
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,990
my friend is waiting for me.

184
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,910
Let's chat some other time. Bye.

185
00:11:08,090 --> 00:11:08,920
My goodness.

186
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,850
Youngsters these days

187
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:11,970
are just unbelievable.

188
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,830
Why?

189
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,030
That beauty from Northeast China is wonderful.

190
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,660

191
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:41,470

Why aren't you the slightest bit interested?

193
00:12:12,370 --> 00:12:13,010
Xia Yao!

194
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:15,140
Open the door.

195
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:16,790
Why did you lock the door?

196
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:17,820
Mom,

197
00:12:17,940 --> 00:12:18,790
don't come in!

198
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:19,980
I'm not dressed!

199
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:22,460
Open up!

200
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,230
What are you doing?

201
00:12:24,380 --> 00:12:24,980
Open the door!

202
00:13:42,020 --> 00:13:42,500
Hey,

203
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,480
Mr. Xia.

204
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:45,580
Why didn't you come to the cocktail party

205
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,780
that was threw for you?

206
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,410
I didn't want to go.

207
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,010
Are you avoiding me?

208
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,140
No, I'm not.

209
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:55,660
Hey,

210
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,500
I'm talking to you!

211
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,740
Don't walk away.

212
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,130
The slit on your dress

213
00:14:00,820 --> 00:14:02,370
reaches all the way up to your hip.

214
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:04,620
How is it?

215
00:14:06,510 --> 00:14:07,870
Sexy, right?

216
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,060
Hey,

217
00:14:13,300 --> 00:14:14,350
don't go.

218
00:14:51,330 --> 00:14:51,900
Brother,

219
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,780
another guy has caught my eye.

220
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:56,930
But he's not interested in me.

221
00:14:57,650 --> 00:14:58,990
Can you help me, please?

222
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:00,860
You're probably the only one

223
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:02,330
in the world who can deal with him.

224
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,480
He's the prince of Imperial City.

225
00:15:06,710 --> 00:15:07,760
He was brought up well

226
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:09,610
and is insanely handsome.

227
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:11,270
His fighting skills are outstanding,

228
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:12,620
and he doesn't have any scandals or a bad history.

229
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:14,060
Here's the most astonishing part.

230
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,970
He's a virgin.

231
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:17,060
Think about it.

232
00:15:17,840 --> 00:15:19,640
Where else can I find a man like that?

233
00:15:19,930 --> 00:15:21,000
I'm the only one

234
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,530
who can handle him.

235
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:25,740
Brother,

236
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:27,200
I'm talking to you!

237
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,500
The problem is that this man

238
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,900
is a real immovable brick.

239
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,530
He doesn't waver no matter what I do.

240
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:38,500
Look at my legs.

241
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,960
They're so sexy and tantalizing.

242
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:41,760
Every man who sees them falls at my feet.

243
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:43,490
I let him feast his eyes every time we meet

244
00:15:43,790 --> 00:15:45,310
but he doesn't show the slightest interest.

245
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,170
What does this mean?

246
00:15:48,460 --> 00:15:50,180
It means this man is dependable.

247
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,540
Brother,

248
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,570
help me.

249
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,110
I promise

250
00:15:58,250 --> 00:16:00,100
that you'll be charmed by him

251
00:16:00,100 --> 00:16:01,340
at first sight.

252
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:04,940
Deal with him yourself.

253
00:16:38,260 --> 00:16:38,700
Madam,

254
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:39,250
chewing gum, please.

255
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:40,600
That'll be ¥3.

256
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,980
Wh-What would you like?

257
00:16:55,450 --> 00:16:56,090
The same as him.
