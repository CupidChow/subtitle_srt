[Episode 29]

4
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,950
That was just a misunderstanding.

5
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,640
The tofu was thrown at your sister.

6
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:08,389
I felt really sorry.

7
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:10,509
Your dress is not out of date.

8
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:11,750
Your taste has improved.

9
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:13,910
You've shot up to high society in one leap.

10
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,090
I'm here today to brag about my wealth!

11
00:02:17,660 --> 00:02:20,030
I thought he sold that lighter ages ago.

12
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,550
I didn't think this money-grubber

13
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:25,170
finally showed some loyalty.

14
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,160
A cool lighter.

15
00:02:28,030 --> 00:02:28,570
Of course!

16
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:29,770
Dayu gave it to me!

17
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,100
How about it?

18
00:02:35,260 --> 00:02:36,810
There are only 99 of these in the world.

19
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,180
Money won't even buy this.

20
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,740
My idol, please give me your autograph.

21
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:45,740
-My idol!
-Stop fiddling with it.

22
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:46,490
Let's go.

23
00:02:46,490 --> 00:02:47,490
Give me your autograph, my idol!

24
00:02:47,620 --> 00:02:48,540
Hey, my idol!

25
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:49,920
Go on with your bragging.

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,360
My idol, give me your autograph!

27
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:55,450
What a shame.

28
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:56,890
Get in.

29
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:05,300
Why isn't Peng Ze here yet?

30
00:03:08,260 --> 00:03:09,120
He must be stuck in traffic.

31
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:12,560
My idol.

32
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:15,410
I heard the bodyguards in your company

33
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:16,780
are hired by top celebrities, right?

34
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,150
Dayu is about to invest in a movie.

35
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,300
I'll be the male lead.

36
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,600
If I shoot to fame,

37
00:03:21,630 --> 00:03:22,210
and become a super star,

38
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:25,210
can I hire you to be my bodyguard?

39
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:34,329
Have you ever seen a man before?

40
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:35,730
I have,

41
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:37,340
but I haven't seen such a masculine one.

42
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,170
Sorry,

43
00:03:42,410 --> 00:03:43,370
we were stuck in a traffic jam.

44
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:50,740
Didn't you agree to bring Liu Xuan here?

45
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:51,970
Why is someone else here?

46
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,890
Since nobody else brings a lady along today,

47
00:03:54,920 --> 00:03:56,150
it will be a downer if I bring one along.

48
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,300
Besides,

49
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:58,980
a gathering with just guys

50
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:00,470
like us,

51
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,360
makes for exciting chats.

52
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:03,180
Doesn't it?

53
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,140
Come on.

54
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,980
Everyone's here.

55
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:05,620
Let's eat.

56
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:10,670
What do you want to drink?

57
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:28,220
What do you want to drink?

58
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,200
This one.

59
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,700
He's Peng Ze, the one I always talk about.

60
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:38,790
We've never been separated.

61
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:40,450
I miss him

62
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:41,420
if we're apart for a few days.

63
00:04:44,350 --> 00:04:44,920
Hello,

64
00:04:45,190 --> 00:04:45,740
I'm Peng Ze.

65
00:04:51,860 --> 00:04:53,290
This is Li Zhenzhen.

66
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:54,750
I'm twenty-two years old.

67
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:56,340
I'm a junior student

68
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,170
and a part-time Taobao model.

69
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:02,530
This is my contact information.

70
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:09,690
I don't need to introduce him, right?

71
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,040
We grew up together.

72
00:05:12,990 --> 00:05:14,040
Let's put the past

73
00:05:14,950 --> 00:05:15,670
behind us.

74
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:18,620
You're so shameless.

75
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:23,220
All right.

76
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,630
I drove here, so I won't drink tonight.

77
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:27,220
I'll raise a toast with tea.

78
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,040
Cheers.

79
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:31,320
Come on.

80
00:05:32,010 --> 00:05:33,090
Peng Ze,

81
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:33,920
why did you..

82
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,270
Why did you suddenly start dealing with mangoes?

83
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:38,970
I majored in biological sciences during university.

84
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:42,020
After I graduated, I've been doing research on this.

85
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:43,060
Are you...

86
00:05:43,060 --> 00:05:44,060
Are you drunk?

87
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:44,670
You haven't even drunk much.

88
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:45,290
How can you be drunk so quickly?

89
00:05:45,340 --> 00:05:46,330
All right, enough.

90
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:47,860
You're the best gamer.

91
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:48,210
Yes,

92
00:05:48,210 --> 00:05:49,300
I'm a top gamer.

93
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:50,310
Don't blabber.

94
00:05:50,650 --> 00:05:51,770
I'm the best.

95
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:52,540
Next time,

96
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,140
let's play

97
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:54,420
at your house.

98
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:55,060
OK?

99
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,740
How about competing with me in growing mangoes?

100
00:05:58,140 --> 00:05:59,060
Growing mangoes?

101
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,420
Yes.

102
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,850
Do mangoes grow on trees or on the ground?

103
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:17,390
For ¥100,000,

104
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,560
I'll buy your lighter.

105
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:20,890
No.

106
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:22,220
Dayu gave this to me.

107
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:23,910
How about this?

108
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:25,580
I'll trade you

109
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,440
this watch for it.

110
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:28,460
Yuan Zong's watch definitely

111
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,050
costs more than my lighter.

112
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,500
Most importantly, it had been worn by Yuan Zong.

113
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,840
It's far more appealing than an autograph or a picture with him.

114
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:35,820
Maybe,

115
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,470
If Yuan Zong becomes even more influential,

116
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:39,230
it could be sold at a much higher price.

117
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:42,010
No.

118
00:06:42,070 --> 00:06:42,909
I won't sell it no matter what!

119
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:46,540
Give it back to me!

120
00:06:46,780 --> 00:06:47,450
Give it to me!

121
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:48,870
Give it to me!

122
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,630
Give it back to me!

123
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,070
Where are you going?

124
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:00,660
To submit these documents.

125
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:02,580
What documents?

126
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,180
Didn't Mr. Yuan tell you

127
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,490
about our company's new charity foundation?

128
00:07:06,970 --> 00:07:08,050
He didn't mention it.

129
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,140
He probably forgot it since he's too busy.

130
00:07:10,410 --> 00:07:11,690
We're going to apply to

131
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:12,660
set up a charity foundation

132
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:13,810
specially to help

133
00:07:13,810 --> 00:07:14,940
disabled veterans.

134
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:16,580
I see.

135
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:20,030
In addition to the company's donations,

136
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:21,300
will you guys donate, too?

137
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,380
That depends on the individual.

138
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,590
But I think everyone is willing to

139
00:07:25,630 --> 00:07:26,550
do their part for charity.

140
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:28,580
I'll leave.

141
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:29,200
Okay.

142
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,990
Mom,

143
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:41,050
have some milk.

144
00:07:43,450 --> 00:07:44,380
Mom.

145
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:46,050
How much money have I saved

146
00:07:46,530 --> 00:07:47,690
in the past two years?

147
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,220
Probably less than ¥200,000.

148
00:07:53,640 --> 00:07:54,440
That little?

149
00:07:55,810 --> 00:07:57,220
What about my new year money?

150
00:07:59,750 --> 00:08:00,580
That will just add up to ¥500,000.

151
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,040
Can I withdraw

152
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,980
all this money?

153
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:06,050
No.

154
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:08,800
Mom.

155
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:10,810
There's actually the case.

156
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:13,060
Yuan Zong's company

157
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,770
set up a charity foundation.

158
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:17,050
Our friendship is so intimate.

159
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:19,010
I have to donate some money,

160
00:08:19,010 --> 00:08:19,540
right?

161
00:08:20,110 --> 00:08:21,230
Is this really why you want the money?

162
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,180
Are you sure it's not for something else?

163
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:23,450
I swear.

164
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:25,120
I absolutely only want to support

165
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,350
my friend's charity foundation.

166
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,820
Well.

167
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:30,650
Yuan Zong treats you

168
00:08:30,670 --> 00:08:31,700
and our family

169
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,950
pretty well.

170
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,360
He even visits me often.

171
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:35,900
He even cooks for you!

172
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:39,130
I'm not greedy for his meals.

173
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,460
I just think he's a decent guy.

174
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:44,420
Moreover,

175
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:45,800
he's involved in charity work.

176
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:47,800
We should support him.

177
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:51,600
How about this?

178
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,420
You can get back your bankbook.

179
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:54,440
I'll add more money

180
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:55,730
to make the total sum ¥200,000.

181
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:58,350
Okay.

182
00:08:58,900 --> 00:08:59,980
I'll announce in public

183
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,860
this is the token

184
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:02,960
from me and my mom.

185
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:04,630
Just ¥200,000.

186
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,800
Why do you drag me into this?

187
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,930
You can choose not to donate,

188
00:09:10,330 --> 00:09:12,290
but I can't leave out your name.

189
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,140
Well.

190
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,020
Fine.

191
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,560
You can take both bankbooks.

192
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,580
You always waste money.

193
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:29,880
Rascal.

194
00:09:30,330 --> 00:09:31,460
Only ¥300,000?

195
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,340
Don't you feel embarrassed?

196
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,530
I really don't have much money.

197
00:09:35,840 --> 00:09:37,520
You should ask Dayu for money.

198
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:39,230
He's the real wealthy man.

199
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,780
At least ¥500,000.

200
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,310
Otherwise, we're no longer friends.

201
00:09:42,890 --> 00:09:43,910
Fine.

202
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:44,900
I promise you.

203
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:45,940
Okay.

204
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:46,780
That's a deal.

205
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,660
Hello, Dayu.

206
00:09:58,180 --> 00:09:59,020
What have you been busy with?

207
00:10:00,390 --> 00:10:02,900
I'm just ready to invest in a new movie.

208
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,300
Oh, here's the case.

209
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:06,980
Yuan Zong's company

210
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:08,500
set up a charity foundation.

211
00:10:09,170 --> 00:10:10,740
There will be a ceremony in a few days.

212
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:12,170
I think

213
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:13,500
we can't attend empty-handed.

214
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,220
Right?

215
00:10:14,220 --> 00:10:15,820
Don't expect me to donate a single cent.

216
00:10:19,580 --> 00:10:20,340
Fine.

217
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,360
Talk about something with you.

218
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:41,410
What is it?

219
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,250
This is ¥1,000,000.

220
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:48,420
donated by my friend Peng Ze and me.

221
00:10:48,830 --> 00:10:50,070
Just put it under his name.

222
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,530
Why?

223
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:56,090
I'm afraid Yuan Zong might reject my money if he knows it.

224
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,510
It's for charity.

225
00:10:57,710 --> 00:10:58,510
He wouldn't do that.

226
00:10:59,150 --> 00:11:00,630
Just put it under his name.

227
00:11:00,820 --> 00:11:01,500
That's less troublesome.

228
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,220
Okay.

229
00:11:02,330 --> 00:11:03,040
Listen to you.

230
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:10,580
Ladies and Gentlemen.

231
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:12,120
Good afternoon.

232
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,910
[ Establishment Ceremony of Charity Foundation]

233
00:11:12,730 --> 00:11:14,390
At the request of Director Yuan

234
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:16,100
of Tianjiao International Safety Academy,

235
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:18,360
we are hosting this charitable donation

236
00:11:18,390 --> 00:11:20,480
to spread love and warmth.

237
00:11:21,140 --> 00:11:22,210
I'd like to take this opportunity

238
00:11:22,250 --> 00:11:24,860
to speak on behalf of all members of

239
00:11:24,890 --> 00:11:25,860
Tianjiao International Safety Academy

240
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:27,940
and the disabled veterans,

241
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:30,340
to welcome all of you

242
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:32,040
to this charity event.

243
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,790
Charity comes from the heart.

244
00:11:40,910 --> 00:11:42,440
Love is priceless.

245
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:43,780
Contribute a heart full of love

246
00:11:43,780 --> 00:11:44,880
and gain hope.

247
00:11:45,020 --> 00:11:46,700
Let's strive together

248
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,420
with gratitude in our hearts,

249
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:51,150
At last, let's give warm welcome

250
00:11:51,170 --> 00:11:53,730
and sincere gratitude again

251
00:11:53,730 --> 00:11:55,210
to our leaders and guests

252
00:11:55,260 --> 00:11:56,540
with enthusiastic applause.

253
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:03,090
Next, we will

254
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,240
announce our most anticipated donors list.

255
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:08,620
We'll announce the first donor of the day.

263
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:47,710
Today,

264
00:12:47,740 --> 00:12:49,420
one of our caring businessman

265
00:12:49,420 --> 00:12:50,380
is not present.

266
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,300
But he has contributed greatly

267
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:53,820
to our event.

268
00:12:53,820 --> 00:12:55,700
He's Xia Yao's good friend.

269
00:12:55,810 --> 00:12:58,040
Xuan Dayu, ¥2,500,000.

270
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:12,340
Darling.

271
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,590
When I first met you,

272
00:13:15,060 --> 00:13:15,920
your figure

273
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:18,310
filled my mind.

274
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:21,170
When I first hugged you,

275
00:13:21,780 --> 00:13:23,180
your warmth

276
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,840
lingered on.

277
00:13:25,410 --> 00:13:27,310
When I first kissed you,

278
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,820
I made up my mind.

279
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:31,010
You're the one I love the most in my life.

280
00:13:31,220 --> 00:13:31,990
Darling,

281
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,240
marry me.

282
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:35,760
Brother,

283
00:13:35,870 --> 00:13:37,190
stop it.

284
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:38,160
Cut.

285
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:39,540
Okay.

286
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:40,560
Done.

287
00:13:43,210 --> 00:13:44,540
Let's get another take.

288
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:45,170
Okay.

289
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:46,410
Okay, one more take.

290
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:47,690
Go.

291
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:49,270
Don't laugh.

292
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:50,160
Be serious.

293
00:13:51,050 --> 00:13:51,470
Go.

294
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,130
Ready.

295
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,640
Action.

296
00:13:56,930 --> 00:13:57,650
Darling.

297
00:13:58,240 --> 00:13:59,880
When I first met you,

298
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,260
your figure

299
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:03,530
filled my mind.

300
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,140
When I first hugged you,

301
00:14:06,450 --> 00:14:08,130
your warmth

302
00:14:08,130 --> 00:14:09,410
lingered on.

303
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:10,210
How's the filming?

304
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:11,090
Not bad

305
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,070
All is going well.

306
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:13,060
-Really?
-I made up my mind.

307
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:15,340
You're the woman I love the most in my life.

308
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:16,320
Darling,

309
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,650
marry me.

310
00:14:17,860 --> 00:14:18,650
Let's go over there

311
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:19,460
to sit down.

312
00:14:19,460 --> 00:14:19,860
Go.

313
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:21,100
Brother, stop it.

314
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,860
Okay. Cut.

315
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:28,660
Okay.

316
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,810
Can we use this out of focus?

317
00:14:31,020 --> 00:14:31,340
Come.

318
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,180
Take a break.

319
00:14:32,180 --> 00:14:32,380
Come.

320
00:14:32,380 --> 00:14:34,370
All units, get ready.

321
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:34,700
Get ready.

322
00:14:34,700 --> 00:14:35,540
One more take.

323
00:14:36,770 --> 00:14:37,610
Hey, Wang Zhishui,

324
00:14:38,370 --> 00:14:39,220
Thanks, Director.

325
00:14:39,650 --> 00:14:40,280
Work hard.

326
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,340
Okay!

327
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:43,220
Hey,

328
00:14:43,220 --> 00:14:44,260
when did you two arrive?

329
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,090
How is it going?

330
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:49,850
-Your legs.
-I'm exhausted.

331
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:01,620
Why are your legs so fair?

332
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:04,600
I've become much tanner.

333
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,370
Yao.

334
00:15:06,660 --> 00:15:08,620
Since when have you been interested in men's legs?

335
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:23,990
What are you doing?

336
00:15:24,010 --> 00:15:24,820
What are you doing?

337
00:15:24,840 --> 00:15:26,030
Eight years ago!

338
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,300
No.

339
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,330
Nine years ago!

340
00:15:28,650 --> 00:15:29,860
Did you ever have a nude video chat?

341
00:15:29,860 --> 00:15:30,480
Help me.

342
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:30,990
Yao.

343
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:32,060
Let's go to other places.

344
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,800
He only has the pretty legs.

345
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:35,130
Spit it out!

346
00:15:35,500 --> 00:15:36,990
Did you ever have a nude video chat?

347
00:15:37,050 --> 00:15:39,340
I didn't even know what a computer was nine years ago!

348
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:40,300
Yes.

349
00:15:40,450 --> 00:15:42,510
He didn't even know what a computer was nine years ago!

350
00:16:12,530 --> 00:16:14,170
Mister! Mister! Mister!

351
00:16:14,290 --> 00:16:15,020
Help.

352
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,250
Mister! Mister!

353
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:17,020
Open the door.

354
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:17,690
Mister! Mister!

355
00:16:18,490 --> 00:16:19,350
Help.

356
00:16:20,610 --> 00:16:22,130
Mister! Mister!

357
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:22,690
What's going on?

358
00:16:22,710 --> 00:16:23,720
Someone fell into a well!

359
00:16:24,060 --> 00:16:25,100
Didn't you call

360
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:26,130
firefighters?

361
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:26,820
We did,

362
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:27,520
but they haven't

363
00:16:27,550 --> 00:16:28,510
arrived yet!

364
00:16:29,420 --> 00:16:30,360
The traffic is so jammed now.

365
00:16:31,130 --> 00:16:32,940
It may cost much time for the firetruck to come over.

366
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:34,490
It's the middle of winter.

367
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:35,810
Each second in the well

368
00:16:35,810 --> 00:16:37,300
brings him closer to death.

369
00:16:40,040 --> 00:16:40,900
Where is he?

370
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:41,680
Over there.

371
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:43,030
Where is he?

372
00:16:48,460 --> 00:16:49,050
Over here.

373
00:16:51,060 --> 00:16:51,860
How long has he been in the well?

374
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,500
About 20 minutes.

375
00:16:54,070 --> 00:16:54,850
20 minutes?

376
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:55,750
The well is so deep,

377
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:56,790
and it's filled with water.

378
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,730
He must freeze down there.

379
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,500
Even if we lower the rope,

380
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:01,870
he can't cling to it.

381
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:02,920
Let me go down.

382
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:05,300
Are you ok?

383
00:17:05,339 --> 00:17:05,740
Rope.

384
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:06,200
Here.

385
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:06,780
Clothes.

386
00:17:20,329 --> 00:17:20,990
Take care.

387
00:17:26,650 --> 00:17:27,180
Lower me.

388
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:30,770
Lower me.

389
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:35,770
Come on.

390
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,330
Lower me.

391
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:37,430
Take care.

392
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:38,310
Take care.

393
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:43,340
Lower.

394
00:17:46,370 --> 00:17:46,970
How is it going?

395
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,560
Brother,

396
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,240
are you ok?

397
00:17:49,570 --> 00:17:50,500
Take care.

398
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,310
A little more!

399
00:17:55,340 --> 00:17:55,940
Lower.

400
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,210
Brother,

401
00:17:58,610 --> 00:17:59,500
how is it going?

402
00:18:01,730 --> 00:18:02,980
I'm almost at the bottom of the well!

403
00:18:12,730 --> 00:18:13,860
A little more!

404
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:20,480
Lower!

405
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:22,570
A little more!

406
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:23,940
How is it going?

407
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:28,080
I found him!

408
00:18:28,770 --> 00:18:29,530
Hang on!

409
00:18:31,180 --> 00:18:32,050
Loosen the rope!

410
00:18:32,250 --> 00:18:32,860
Okay!

411
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:35,240
How is it?

412
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:36,690
Yes!

413
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,460
I'm tying him with the rope!

414
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,500
Hang on!

415
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:46,500
Hang on for a while!

416
00:18:47,890 --> 00:18:48,770
Just a while.

417
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:02,220
Pull!

418
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:21,930
We can't make it.
