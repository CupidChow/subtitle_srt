[Episode 9]

4
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:31,880
So, this is the place?

5
00:02:31,910 --> 00:02:32,920
Look at this venue, isn't it awesome?

6
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:33,829
It's that guy again.

7
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,490
That's our training ground over there.

8
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:37,450
Mr. Yuan.

9
00:02:37,990 --> 00:02:39,040
Do you see that guy in green shirt?

10
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:39,740
Yes.

11
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:40,450
Without my permission,

12
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,490
don't let him go in the training ground.

13
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:41,980
Understand?

14
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:43,350
Roger.

15
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:44,140
Mr. Yuan, don't worry.

16
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,940
We will learn a lot of stuff in our academy.

17
00:02:53,990 --> 00:02:54,660
This is for bodyguards.

18
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:57,820
The training ground

19
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,760
is through this door.

20
00:02:59,540 --> 00:03:00,270
Right here.

21
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,610
Hello, sir.

22
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,010
Our training is conducted in secret,

23
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,470
non-trainees can't enter the training room.

24
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,000
I've already talked to the guard at the door,

25
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,240
and he nodded in agreement.

26
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:09,980
That's his dereliction of duty.

27
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:13,500
It's just fitness training today.

28
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:15,370
Shouldn't it be fine for him to go in and have a look?

29
00:03:15,790 --> 00:03:16,140
Sorry,

30
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:17,060
but this is not allowed.

31
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,820
I mean, it's just a bodyguard academy,

32
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,170
why do you indulge in so much formalism?

33
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:23,240
I've been to many higher-end bodyguard academies,

34
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,730
-and none of them are like yours!
-All right, all right.

35
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,400
I'll go talk to Mr. Yuan.

36
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:27,040
Let's go.

37
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:29,370
Let's go. Come with me.

38
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,600
Did you do that on purpose?

39
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:39,600
What do you mean?

40
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:48,010
What happened

41
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:48,880
to his ear?

42
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:49,960
It's...

43
00:03:49,990 --> 00:03:50,410
nothing.

44
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,200
N-nothing much.

45
00:03:51,790 --> 00:03:53,610
My friend wants to watch me training.

46
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:55,140
Since it's against the rules,

47
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:56,480
I'll leave for now.

48
00:03:56,500 --> 00:03:57,070
Stop.

49
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:06,510
You bit someone,

50
00:04:06,740 --> 00:04:07,720
and you think you can just get away from it?

51
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:11,340
Who bit you?

52
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,190
A puppy did.

53
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:18,459
Fine.

54
00:04:19,399 --> 00:04:20,250
What do you want?

55
00:04:20,920 --> 00:04:22,070
An apology or medicine?

56
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,140
Just name it.

57
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:25,890
Either

58
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:27,230
you let me bite you,

59
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:28,490
or

60
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:29,930
you go on a date with my sister for a day.

61
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:34,060
What if I don't choose either?

62
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:36,710
In that case,

63
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,250
please take your friend out of here.

64
00:04:39,450 --> 00:04:40,620
Xuan Dayu just returned to China,

65
00:04:40,950 --> 00:04:41,830
and I have to go to work.

66
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:44,400
The time we could spend together is already limited...

67
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:49,000
Bite me.

68
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:51,760
Are you that repulsed by the thought of meeting my sister?

69
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:52,950
Are you going to bite me or not?

70
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:58,180
You made your choice.

71
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,800
I knew you wouldn't dare to bite me.

72
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,410
Wait.

73
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,600
Your combat uniform is torn.

74
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:04,840
Wear this one instead.

75
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:10,340
Look how terrified you are.

76
00:05:30,190 --> 00:05:30,540
Okay.

77
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:30,970
Got it.

78
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:32,340
Come on.

79
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,020
Show us.

80
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:40,790
Higher.

81
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:41,490
That's it.

82
00:05:45,430 --> 00:05:45,750
Well done!

83
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,260
Bravo!

84
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:52,110
Catch it.

85
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:52,490
Slow down.

86
00:05:52,730 --> 00:05:53,800
Look down at your feet and shield your face.

87
00:05:53,830 --> 00:05:54,310
Cover your face.

88
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:55,720
OK, turn around.

89
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,760
Nice. Turn back.

90
00:06:00,630 --> 00:06:01,040
Nice.

91
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,130
Very well.

92
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:04,250
All right,

93
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,190
take a five-minute break, everyone.

94
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:06,460
Pick that up.

95
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,270
How was it?

96
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,490
When you are on a mission,

97
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,730
you must never let your client

98
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,510
leave your protective perimeter.

99
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:06,670
Be prepared at all times to act as a human shield.

100
00:07:06,990 --> 00:07:08,570
The exercise we're doing today

101
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,520
is about how to quickly

102
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:12,880
shield your client behind you.

103
00:07:14,590 --> 00:07:15,060
Start.

104
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:15,560
One!

105
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:18,600
Two!

106
00:07:21,630 --> 00:07:22,140
One!

107
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:26,540
Two!

108
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,350
One!

109
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:35,720
Two!

110
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:37,810
One!

111
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,150
Two!

112
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,340
One!

113
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:51,060
Two!

114
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:56,890
One!

115
00:07:59,440 --> 00:07:59,870
Two!

116
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:02,990
One!

117
00:08:05,770 --> 00:08:07,030
Why is he keep blocking me?

118
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:09,390
One!

119
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:12,710
Two!

120
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:16,290
One!

121
00:08:19,990 --> 00:08:20,430
Two!

122
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,220
Is he doing this on purpose?

123
00:08:23,370 --> 00:08:23,800
Two!

124
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:27,970
One!

125
00:08:30,550 --> 00:08:30,920
Two!

126
00:08:34,059 --> 00:08:34,539
One!

127
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:37,970
Go!

128
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:38,500
Go!

129
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,390
Go!

130
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,179
Go!

131
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:42,590
Go!

132
00:08:42,909 --> 00:08:43,470
Go!

133
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:44,270
Go!

134
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,100
Keep practicing.

135
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:47,500
One step.

136
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:51,510
Go, go, go.

137
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:55,050
Do it again!

138
00:08:55,550 --> 00:08:56,500
Go, go.

139
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,190
Go, go.

140
00:08:58,990 --> 00:08:59,830
Focus.

141
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:02,050
What are you doing?

142
00:09:02,750 --> 00:09:03,480
What are you doing?

143
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,240
-What are you doing? -Dayu!

144
00:09:07,150 --> 00:09:08,550
What's wrong with you?

145
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:09,170
Dayu!

146
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:11,300
Do you think that was a proper training?

147
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:13,030
Hurt him again, and see what happens!

148
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:14,220
What are you doing?

149
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,380
Hurt him again and see what happens!

150
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:16,380
Out!

151
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:18,930
Forget it.

152
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,330
Fine.

153
00:09:20,690 --> 00:09:21,230
Wait and see.

154
00:09:48,190 --> 00:09:49,140
Are you crazy?

155
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:50,050
I'm not crazy!

156
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:51,570
You're just gonna let him kick you, huh?

157
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:52,360
We were training.

158
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,390
This was a training!

159
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,160
You think I'm blind?

160
00:09:55,430 --> 00:09:56,450
Is it okay to kick any trainees during training?

161
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,250
Enough!

162
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:57,760
Stop!

163
00:09:58,110 --> 00:09:58,980
Cut it off!

164
00:09:59,150 --> 00:09:59,720
That's enough!

165
00:10:00,100 --> 00:10:00,500
Forget it.

166
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,190
I'm telling you,

167
00:10:01,540 --> 00:10:02,580
I just smashed your equipment, it's not a big deal.

168
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:03,790
If you dare to piss me off,

169
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:05,430
I'll shut down your entire bodyguard business!

170
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:06,480
Enough!

171
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,840
Calm down. Calm down.

172
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:15,550
Let's go.

173
00:10:43,580 --> 00:10:44,330
Here, over here!

174
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:47,940
Good! Nice shot!

175
00:10:52,030 --> 00:10:52,550
Thanks.

176
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:02,910
Look what you've done.

177
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,160
It's just a kick.

178
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:07,710
Why did you have to be so edgy about it?

179
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:09,280
Everyone has been hit once or twice.

180
00:11:09,910 --> 00:11:11,050
He can beat whoever he wants,

181
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,500
except for you.

182
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,710
I don't give a damn about their reasons.

183
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:24,800
Do you still remember

184
00:11:25,650 --> 00:11:26,450
when we were kids?

185
00:11:26,490 --> 00:11:27,490
If anyone dared to bully you,

186
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:28,570
I'd beat the hell out of them.

187
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,300
It's the same now,

188
00:11:30,580 --> 00:11:32,100
I don't allow anyone to hurt you

189
00:11:32,750 --> 00:11:33,530
in any circumstances.

190
00:11:34,910 --> 00:11:35,820
I'm stronger than you,

191
00:11:36,610 --> 00:11:37,730
I don't need your protection.

192
00:11:39,380 --> 00:11:40,470
But your complexion is fairer than me.

193
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,900
What does my complexion have anything to do with that?

194
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:46,470
Isn't it obvious?

195
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:48,160
A person with fair skin

196
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,000
is more likely to arouse others' sadistic tendencies,

197
00:11:52,170 --> 00:11:53,290
especially that man,

198
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:55,420
the way he looks at you is so different.

199
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:57,760
Who?

200
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:00,400
Your chief instructor.

201
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:01,740
What's his name again? Mr. Yuan?

202
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,180
He's only 30 years old.

203
00:12:06,990 --> 00:12:08,230
He's not much older than us.

204
00:12:09,350 --> 00:12:10,370
He built this academy from scratch

205
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,060
and just started making a name for himself.

206
00:12:13,230 --> 00:12:14,430
It's been tough for him after striving for years.

207
00:12:15,580 --> 00:12:16,670
You ruined many years of his works

208
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:18,560
with your tantrum.

209
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:21,840
Well, I think what I did was not even enough.

210
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,990
I should have burned this place to the ground.

211
00:12:28,750 --> 00:12:29,090
Let's go.

212
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,000
Let's have one more match.

213
00:12:34,290 --> 00:12:34,840
Last week,

214
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:36,160
our company

215
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:37,630
experienced a very serious case of vandalism.

216
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:40,720
So, the topic for today's meeting is

217
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,500
how to prevent such an incident from happening again.

218
00:12:44,190 --> 00:12:45,650
We've been running these classes for four, five years now,

219
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:47,320
and we've never encountered such a troublemaker.

220
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:51,120
I think the best solution is to refund his tuition fees.

221
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:52,570
We can't accommodate trainee

222
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:53,410
like this.

223
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:54,960
Mr. Yuan,

224
00:12:54,990 --> 00:12:55,700
what do you think?

225
00:12:57,060 --> 00:12:58,680
After all the effort it took for this rabbit to enter my place,

226
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,070
there's no way I'm chasing him away.

227
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,830
Even if he sets this place on fire,

228
00:13:02,030 --> 00:13:03,870
I'll have to keep him within this ruins!

229
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,040
If this person makes another mistake,

230
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:09,170
leave it to me to handle.

231
00:13:10,020 --> 00:13:11,390
That would worsen the situation.

232
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,600
Mr. Yuan.

233
00:13:13,190 --> 00:13:15,000
Don't you think it would escalate this whole matter?

234
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:24,530
Are you dumb?

235
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:25,940
Don't you know who he is?

236
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,220
He's Mr.Yuan's future brother-in-law.

237
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,560
Do you really think he'll give him a lesson?

238
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,990
You didn't get Mr. Yuan's message.

239
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:32,410
What he just said means

240
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,520
we can't meddle with this person.

241
00:13:35,210 --> 00:13:35,850
That's impossible.

242
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:39,220
Mr. Yuan has always been strict

243
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:40,270
and impartial.

244
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:42,710
He won't give anyone privileges!

245
00:13:44,030 --> 00:13:46,220
Mr. Yuan deducted 3,000 from his wages, but I assumed that's not enough.

246
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,410
How much were the damages?

247
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:04,860
I'll cover it.

248
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:11,750
I'm asking you.

249
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,150
How much was it?

250
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:16,930
Give me a hand.

251
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,720
I told you to come over and help.

252
00:15:23,750 --> 00:15:24,230
Do you hear me?

253
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,650
You're really slow on the uptake.

254
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:28,440
You haven't done much work,

255
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:29,870
but you're sweating a lot.

256
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,380
It smells like metal.

257
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:36,630
How many days have you struggling with insomnia?

258
00:16:38,470 --> 00:16:39,340
No way I would be that worried.

259
00:16:39,970 --> 00:16:41,200
He just smashed a few equipment.

260
00:16:41,650 --> 00:16:42,750
And I have the money to pay the compensation.

261
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,900
Someone was still awake at 1 A.M.

262
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:47,800
tossing and turning in bed.

263
00:16:49,070 --> 00:16:50,410
Since you came over last night,

264
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:52,090
why didn't you make a sound?

265
00:16:54,860 --> 00:16:56,660
Your buddy smashed my company's equipment,

266
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:58,490
why would I talk to you?

267
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,310
My friend smashed your company's equipment,

268
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,250
why did you bother coming over to check on me?

269
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,020
Enough of this small talk.

270
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:12,710
How much do I owe you?

271
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:13,770
I'll pay it up.

272
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:15,720
None.

273
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:16,880
I fixed them by myself.

274
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:18,890
Then I'll pay you the material fee.

275
00:17:20,150 --> 00:17:20,829
You don't need to pay me.

276
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:22,829
Consider your tuition has it covered.

277
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:24,589
From now on,

278
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:25,839
I'll be your instructor.

279
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:35,270
Thanks, no need.

280
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,200
Why not?

281
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,480
I won't bite.

282
00:17:43,220 --> 00:17:43,840
No reason.

283
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:45,240
I just don't want you to train me.

284
00:17:46,390 --> 00:17:47,220
Who was clinging to my ear and

285
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,990
wouldn't stop biting it the day we got drunk?

286
00:17:49,550 --> 00:17:50,620
Now you're not in the mood?

287
00:17:51,160 --> 00:17:51,510
You...

288
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:08,070
Look at you.

289
00:18:08,470 --> 00:18:09,200
Pretty impressive.

290
00:18:12,470 --> 00:18:13,330
Of course.

291
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,270
I'm one of the kind.

292
00:18:15,830 --> 00:18:17,580
I came here to master your skills

293
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:18,460
and find your weakness.

294
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,000
Once I learn all this, you won't be able to stalk me.

295
00:18:22,730 --> 00:18:23,800
Why are you staring at me?

296
00:18:26,790 --> 00:18:28,580
Who's the guy that made a scene here the other day?

297
00:18:30,190 --> 00:18:31,160
That was my friend,

298
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,520
also my childhood buddy.

299
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:34,290
He left when we were in high school.

300
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:35,810
And we haven't met each other for years.

301
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:37,300
He just came back a few days ago.

302
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:38,950
He's really riled up as a friend who returned just a few days ago.

303
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:40,630
You only got one hit, and that drove him crazy.

304
00:18:41,510 --> 00:18:42,100
What are you implying for?

305
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:43,770
Nothing.

306
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:54,450
Chief Instructor! Report!

307
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:57,160
Xia Yao slacked off for 20 minutes during fitness training.

308
00:18:58,810 --> 00:18:59,750
OK. I got it.

309
00:19:02,690 --> 00:19:03,680
Chief Instructor! Report!

310
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:05,740
Xia Yao left without permission to pick up a call

311
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:07,250
and failed to finish his task on time.

312
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:09,010
I see.
