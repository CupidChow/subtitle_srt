00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:39,090
Awesome!

5
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:40,790
Dude,

6
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,960
sing me a song!

7
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,390
What do you want to hear?

8
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:45,370
Heavy metal!

9
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:46,410
Who do you think I am? Timmy Xu?

10
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,930
Come on! Just say me a few lines.

11
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:50,350
What's so nice about his music?

12
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,490
I'll sing you a more exciting song.

13
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:53,310
Hit it!

14
00:02:55,740 --> 00:02:56,300
Ready?

00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:00,330

Look! A rainbow!

20
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:38,490
Here, try this.

21
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:41,320
Take one.

22
00:03:55,950 --> 00:03:57,020
Why did you join the army?

23
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,590
I just want to provide a better life for my family.

24
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:11,760
y dad didn't have much education,

25
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,220
and we were poor.

26
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:15,330
He didn't get married

27
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,399
until he was in his thirties.

28
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,200
My mom had health issues,

29
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,810
and she was in her forties

30
00:04:21,399 --> 00:04:22,170
when she had my younger sister.

31
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:24,710
Unfortunately, she passed away

32
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:26,540
not long after giving birth.

33
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:29,510
I finished junior high

34
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:31,210
and then joined the army.

35
00:04:32,990 --> 00:04:33,409
Initially,

36
00:04:34,030 --> 00:04:35,010
it was just for a job,

37
00:04:36,490 --> 00:04:37,470
but over time,

38
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:38,930
I found purpose in the military,

39
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,620
made some great comrades,

40
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,600
and developed

41
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,800
a special bond with the service.

42
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:48,990
You must be quite reluctant to leave there.

43
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:57,350
Enough about me.

44
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,620
How about you?

45
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:00,810
You were probably treated like a little prince

46
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:02,700
when you were a kid, weren't you?

47
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:04,600
That's not true.

48
00:05:05,490 --> 00:05:06,750
When my grandpa was still alive,

49
00:05:06,950 --> 00:05:07,760
we didn't have separate households.

50
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:09,300
I had several grandmothers at home,

51
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:11,470
You know, those times were quite different.

52
00:05:12,590 --> 00:05:13,620
We all lived together,

53
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:17,070
but it wasn't like the scheming and plotting you see on TV.

54
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:18,870
We were a harmonious extended family.

55
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:20,870
In fact, my childhood,

56
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,100
except for having a few more drivers

57
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:22,950
and nannies than you,

58
00:05:23,190 --> 00:05:23,960
was pretty much the same.

59
00:05:31,170 --> 00:05:32,750
I remember when I was a kid,

60
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:35,130
my dad used to buy me all sorts of limited edition

61
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,120
car models,  remote-controlled planes,

62
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:38,640
and various

63
00:05:38,670 --> 00:05:40,220
unreleased video game consoles.

64
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:42,940
I had a diverse range of games growing up too,

65
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:44,940
like rolling iron hoops,

66
00:05:45,540 --> 00:05:46,159
grabbing the monkey's stick,

67
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:47,659
ice monkey,

68
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:48,930
and marbles.

69
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:50,360
And, of course,

70
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:51,909
we had some Northeastern delicacies,

71
00:05:52,700 --> 00:05:53,930
like frozen persimmons,

72
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:54,960
frozen pears.

73
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,330
and gummies

74
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:58,430
that were 1 yuan for two pieces.

75
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:00,330
Right,

76
00:06:00,540 --> 00:06:01,450
plus, we had big dumplings,

77
00:06:02,040 --> 00:06:02,620
crispy pork in sauce,

78
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,070
and pork stew with glass noodles.

79
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:04,900
Sounds delicious.

80
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:06,870
I'll take you to my hometown if there's a chance.

81
00:06:07,420 --> 00:06:08,390
We'll sit on a heated floor

82
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,810
and feast on authentic northeastern food.

83
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:11,350
Here.

84
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:16,070
Give me one more.

85
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,040
It's kinda late now.

86
00:06:37,350 --> 00:06:37,850
Hurry up.

87
00:06:37,950 --> 00:06:38,409
Stop fooling around.

88
00:06:39,060 --> 00:06:39,820
We have to hurry,

89
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:41,330
otherwise, we won't make it back by midnight.

90
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:42,490
Come on.

91
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:48,350
Let's go.

92
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,300
It's fine, I'm not cold.

93
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:54,170
You'll feel cold on the road.

94
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:02,070
Let's go.

95
00:07:38,810 --> 00:07:39,340
Are you feeling cold?

96
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,510
If you are, I'll lower the speed.

97
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,220
You can't go any slower.

98
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:46,070
If you do, we'll have to spend the night on the streets.

99
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:55,409
Are you feeling cold?

100
00:07:56,220 --> 00:07:56,710
No.

101
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:12,870
Oops.

102
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:14,760
Why does the sky suddenly turn gloomy?

103
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:16,020
Hey.

104
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:17,080
Speed up.

105
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:18,770
Don't let the clouds catch us.

106
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:20,510
You wish.

107
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:22,180
This is the provincial highway.

108
00:08:22,620 --> 00:08:23,630
The road conditions here were already poor,

109
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:25,330
and there's a lot of traffic at this spot.

110
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,820
If we accelerate any further, it's not a joyride,

111
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:28,970
it's risking our lives.

112
00:08:58,410 --> 00:08:59,210
Why aren't you putting one on?

113
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:00,170
It's pouring.

114
00:09:00,670 --> 00:09:01,640
Driving might be risky now.

115
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:03,700
Don't be stubborn.

116
00:09:03,950 --> 00:09:04,760
Let's leave when the rain lightens up.

117
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:07,990
But we have to get going.

118
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:09,480
Really?

119
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:13,510
Fine, you drive.

120
00:09:14,380 --> 00:09:15,040
OK, not a big deal.

121
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,700
Do you have any vacant rooms?

122
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,090
We only have one single room left.

123
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:18,570
Hey, Sir, don't go.

124
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:19,750
It's pouring outside,

125
00:10:19,970 --> 00:10:20,930
it's tough to find any vacant hotel rooms.

126
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,630
All the other hotels are completely booked up

127
00:10:21,630 --> 00:10:23,260
except for ours.

128
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:25,790
This place, not too big but not too small, is situated in a popular tourist area.

129
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:27,600
Rooms are fully booked at this time every year.

130
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:28,890
If you keep hesitating,

131
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:30,670
it could be really hard to find a room.

132
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:32,210
Besides, it's raining outside,

133
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:33,630
If you don't take this room,

134
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:35,050
someone else will book this room in no time.

135
00:10:35,380 --> 00:10:37,080
It's hard to get rooms on rainy days.

136
00:10:39,830 --> 00:10:40,380
Hey,

137
00:10:41,270 --> 00:10:41,820
how about

138
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:43,080
we get through one night here?

139
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:44,820
Madam,

140
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,860
do you still have a room

141
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:46,910
We only have a single room left.

142
00:10:46,950 --> 00:10:47,950
How about we share a room?

143
00:10:48,250 --> 00:10:48,630
OK.

144
00:10:50,040 --> 00:10:51,040
Please show me your ID.

145
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:51,750
OK.

146
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:53,340
We're both guys. What's there to fear?

147
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,620
It's pouring outside,

148
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,420
it'd be hard for us to find another place.

149
00:11:00,660 --> 00:11:01,540
Give me a minute.

150
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,420
Let me check if these two still want the room or not.

151
00:11:03,630 --> 00:11:04,060
Alright.

152
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,620
See?

153
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,040
These two aren't even a couple,

154
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:11,390
but they're planning to share a room tonight.

155
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:13,590
What are you two worrying about?

156
00:11:14,690 --> 00:11:15,230
How much is it?

157
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:15,840
Three hundred.

158
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,910
Wait a sec, ma'am.

159
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:18,290
They took the last room, right?

160
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,420
Yes, I'm really sorry.

161
00:11:20,420 --> 00:11:20,900
It's fine.

162
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:21,340
Okay.

163
00:11:23,390 --> 00:11:24,020
We'll take this one.

164
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:26,270
Okay, please show me your ID.

165
00:11:32,510 --> 00:11:33,830
Here's your room key and your ID card.

166
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,030
If it turns out

167
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:46,700
that I still can't accept your sister in the end,

168
00:11:48,220 --> 00:11:49,470
will you still

169
00:11:50,660 --> 00:11:51,810
take me out,

170
00:11:52,570 --> 00:11:53,630
cook delicious meals,

171
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:55,060
and treat me as kindly

172
00:11:56,670 --> 00:11:57,330
as you do now?

173
00:11:59,580 --> 00:12:00,210
Are you scared?

174
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,560
Scared of what?

175
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,230
Scared that I'll stop treating you like this.

176
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,610
My parents

177
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,110
are the only ones

178
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:13,490
who have been nice to me all my life.

179
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:18,490
But I won't make compromises just because of this.

180
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:26,400
My sister

181
00:12:27,310 --> 00:12:28,620
isn't the only reason I treat you well.

182
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,150
Then what other reasons do you have?

183
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,370
I'll tell you

184
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,470
that in the future...

185
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,860
Coming.

186
00:13:06,890 --> 00:13:07,530
Ma'am.

187
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:10,190
Isn't this Dayu?

188
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:11,690
I haven't seen you in years.

189
00:13:11,980 --> 00:13:12,940
You still look the same

190
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,130
after so many years.

191
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:15,470
You're so sweet.

192
00:13:15,500 --> 00:13:16,370
Come, come. Please come in.

193
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:16,960
OK.

194
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,850
It's been so many years since I last saw you, right?

195
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:19,600
Indeed, Ma'am.

196
00:13:19,990 --> 00:13:21,190
Do you prefer a drink or milk?

197
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:21,820
I'm fine with anything.

198
00:13:22,220 --> 00:13:23,420
OK. Have a seat.

199
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:23,810
Got it.

200
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:30,700
Dayu.

201
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:31,350
Yes,

202
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:31,730
Ma'am?

203
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,950
Here, have some milk.

204
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:33,440
OK.

205
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:35,280
Ma'am,

206
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:36,960
is Xiao Yao at home?

207
00:13:37,820 --> 00:13:39,170
He went out early yesterday morning.

208
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,960
He said he was going on a joyride with a friend.

209
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:42,970
I didn't ask about where he's heading to.

210
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:44,750
This kid is a grown up now.

211
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:47,010
If I asked him too much, he'd be annoyed.

212
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:48,260
Make yourself at home.

213
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,590
I'll go get you something to eat.

214
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:56,850
He made up an excuse about resting to reject me

215
00:13:57,260 --> 00:13:58,390
and hang out with someone else.

216
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,420
Doubled?

217
00:14:03,450 --> 00:14:04,810
You'll have to drink more, it's doubled.

218
00:14:04,870 --> 00:14:06,010
Let's see if you're still a heavy drinker today.

219
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,220
How dare you play dirty?

220
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:09,060
None of your business.

221
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,420
Move on! Let's continue.

222
00:14:10,980 --> 00:14:11,660
Two threes.

223
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:12,820
All right.

224
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:13,390
Drink up.

225
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:13,940
Bottoms up!

226
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:14,380
It's doubled!

227
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,460
Drink more.

228
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:16,750
You drink.

229
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,820
I gotta carry you home on my back today.

230
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,780
Do you want to drink with us?

231
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:21,420
Sure.

232
00:14:24,930 --> 00:14:25,960
Fill the glass for him.

233
00:14:29,260 --> 00:14:30,890
Guess my luck sucks today.

234
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,300
Pour more. Come on.

235
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,380
Here, let's drink together. Bottoms up.

236
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:37,260
Come on!

237
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,820
Drink up! Drink up.

238
00:14:49,740 --> 00:14:50,670
There's one more card left.

239
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:51,630
One more card.

240
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,520
Well, show us.

241
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,190
Hurry up.

242
00:14:53,210 --> 00:14:54,310
I'll go easy on you.

243
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:55,140
Fine.

244
00:14:55,570 --> 00:14:56,480
King, see?

245
00:14:56,510 --> 00:14:57,150
Did you see that?

246
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:58,040
Drink up!

247
00:14:58,220 --> 00:14:59,140
Just drink.

248
00:14:59,580 --> 00:15:00,900
All right, another doubled game.

249
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,030
Let's drink up together later.

250
00:15:03,030 --> 00:15:05,020
Wow, that was fast.

251
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:05,660
Hey.

252
00:15:05,660 --> 00:15:07,420
Cheers!

253
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,260
Come on.

254
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,260
Join us, come play with us.

255
00:15:11,260 --> 00:15:11,780
Join us.

256
00:15:11,780 --> 00:15:12,100
Come on.

257
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:12,780
Are you ready?

258
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:13,620
Let's roll!

259
00:15:14,140 --> 00:15:15,060
Cheers!
