[Episode 14]

4
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:07,060
Brother, is the food ready?

5
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:09,919
I'm so hungry.

6
00:02:16,460 --> 00:02:17,250
What is this?

7
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:19,420
This is a northeastern special.

8
00:02:19,570 --> 00:02:20,570
Chicken marinated in Hua Diao wine.

9
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:23,110
I soaked it with Hua Diao wine I made 8 years ago..

10
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:24,520
Have a taste.

11
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,110
It's rude for me to start eating first.

12
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,400
Let's eat together when you're done cooking.

13
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:30,750
All right.

14
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:44,920
This is delicious!

15
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:46,110
My goodness!

16
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,010
Ribs in soy sauce.

17
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,640
This is another northeastern special.

18
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,170
Delicious!

19
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,520
Where did you buy the Chinese sauerkraut?

20
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,350
I made them myself.

21
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:40,690
The ones sold at supermarkets

22
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:41,460
are tasteless.

23
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:49,170
It's delicious!

24
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,200
All right.

25
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:33,650
Delicious.

26
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:52,350
Son,

27
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:54,200
why are you back so late?

28
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:56,450
I had to work overtime.

29
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,360
Wash your hands and come to eat.

30
00:04:58,750 --> 00:04:59,510
I ate.

31
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,180
Again?

32
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:02,860
Why do you often eat out these days?

33
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:05,350
I get hungry

34
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:06,220
during working overtime.

35
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:07,500
I ate something hastily.

36
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:08,150
Eat more.

37
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,220
These are your favorite dishes.

38
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:10,960
No.

39
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,960
Eating too much at night is bad for health.

40
00:05:13,910 --> 00:05:14,510
Xia Yao,

41
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:15,550
do you have...

42
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:16,670
I'm going back my room to take a bath.

43
00:05:16,700 --> 00:05:17,270
I'm really tired.

44
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:52,780
It's so hard to

45
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,530
meet with you.

46
00:05:55,350 --> 00:05:56,460
I'm busy.

47
00:05:56,810 --> 00:05:57,990
I have to work overtime every day.

48
00:06:00,470 --> 00:06:02,050
Why do I think you get fatter

49
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,840
from working more?

50
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:04,900
I got fatter?

51
00:06:06,030 --> 00:06:06,490
Yes.

52
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:09,630
Maybe it's swelling.

53
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,170
I didn't get enough sleep these days.

54
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,680
Peng Ze, it's your turn.

55
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,280
Play a round or two for me.

56
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:27,610
Come on, drink with me.

57
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:32,870
How's it going with

58
00:06:32,909 --> 00:06:33,450
your pursuit of the girl?

59
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:36,700
That's the girl over there.

60
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:37,820
The girl with the baseball cap.

61
00:06:38,150 --> 00:06:38,980
She's the one I'm interested in.

62
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,390
She looks so-so.

63
00:06:46,770 --> 00:06:47,730
Her looks

64
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,480
isn't outstanding indeed.

65
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:51,620
But I love her personality.

66
00:06:52,330 --> 00:06:53,380
She's really wild.

67
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:07,640
Dayu, here.

68
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:08,350
Try the shrimp.

69
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,830
Taste the dishes I cooked.

70
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,580
Don't worry, Auntie.

71
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,910
I won't hold back at your home.

72
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:12,640
That's good.

73
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:14,910
I love watching you enjoy your food.

74
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:16,700
Right.

75
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:18,220
I'll go get

76
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:18,960
the pickles your uncle sent over.

77
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:19,930
Delicious.

78
00:07:27,310 --> 00:07:29,150
Peng Ze called me

79
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:30,590
and said you're feeling down.

80
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:31,800
What happened?

81
00:07:33,040 --> 00:07:34,070
I'm fine.

82
00:07:34,590 --> 00:07:35,990
I just feel tired.

83
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:40,700
These days,

84
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:42,790
I only have one wish.

85
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,110
What?

86
00:07:44,190 --> 00:07:45,360
Catching Wang Zhishui.

87
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,880
Is he still on your mind?

88
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,180
I'm losing sleep and my appetite by thinking about him.

89
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,920
You're still voracious.

90
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:57,670
Is it the same?

91
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:13,650
Xiao Hui.

92
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,110
Here.

93
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:15,640
Look at the pimples on my face.

94
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:16,930
They're ruining my face.

95
00:08:17,110 --> 00:08:18,310
How can I find a lover in the future?

96
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:20,790
Looks don't matter when you're looking for a lover.

97
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,980
Look at Mr. Xia.

98
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:23,140
He is so handsome.

99
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,740
He's still single like you.

100
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:27,520
Comparison with others is toxic.

101
00:08:27,870 --> 00:08:29,320
He used to be so gloomy,

102
00:08:29,350 --> 00:08:30,440
but he's become so cheerful.`

103
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:32,270
You...

104
00:08:32,289 --> 00:08:33,200
Stop.

105
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:33,860
The phone's ringing.

106
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:34,830
Hello.

107
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:36,130
What? Did you catch him?

108
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:37,309
Okay, I'll be right there.

109
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:41,140
Go. Come with me.

110
00:08:41,220 --> 00:08:41,620
What's going on?

111
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,809
Forget it. Go out first.

112
00:09:01,710 --> 00:09:02,270
Hello.

113
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:03,660
Yao.

114
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,380
Let me tell you one thing.

115
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:06,770
I made a dream last night.

116
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:08,410
What did you dream about?

117
00:09:08,910 --> 00:09:10,650
I dreamed that

118
00:09:10,970 --> 00:09:11,770
I caught Wang Zhishui.

119
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:12,700
Then?

120
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:14,520
Then.

121
00:09:14,630 --> 00:09:16,160
I chopped off both of his arms.

122
00:09:17,470 --> 00:09:19,870
I chopped off his fingers one by one.

123
00:09:21,890 --> 00:09:23,600
That's vicious.

124
00:09:25,780 --> 00:09:26,200
All right.

125
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:28,070
I'm hanging up.

126
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,320
I'm still working.

127
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:31,260
Okay, bye bye.

128
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,240
Sure, bye.

129
00:09:42,190 --> 00:09:43,270
I thought it was something serious.

130
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,700
In the end, there was only one drunk punk.

131
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,920
I even take three other guys with me.

132
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:46,860
Exactly.

133
00:09:47,010 --> 00:09:48,130
His limbs were like sticks.

134
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,690
Thank goodness you didn't take Xia Yao with you.

135
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,750
Xia Yao could probably

136
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:52,580
lift him up with one hand.

137
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:55,060
What are you guys talking about?

138
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,520
His uncle

139
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,620
always lost Maotai.

140
00:09:57,950 --> 00:09:59,100
The thief was caught.

141
00:10:00,310 --> 00:10:00,990
How was he caught?

142
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:02,190
Come on. Let me tell you.

143
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:03,480
This thief is really odd.

144
00:10:03,670 --> 00:10:05,230
He never took the liquor with him after his theft.

145
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:06,190
He finished the liquor on the spot.

146
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:07,380
Guess what happened this time.

147
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:08,470
What?

148
00:10:08,550 --> 00:10:09,980
He got drunk and slept through the night until morning.

149
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:11,110
He even didn't get awake the next day.

150
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:12,000
And my uncle came back.

151
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:15,380
He...

152
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:17,290
He is so odd.

153
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:18,460
What's his name?

154
00:10:19,340 --> 00:10:20,770
It seems to be Li Zhishui?

155
00:10:21,510 --> 00:10:24,110
Probably Wang Zhishui?

156
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:25,610
I don't remember anyway.

157
00:10:26,050 --> 00:10:27,290
I can only remember the last name.

158
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:28,280
"The Myth of Dayu and the Great Flood," right?

159
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,200
Where is he right now?

160
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:32,920
He's at my uncle's house.

161
00:10:32,960 --> 00:10:34,330
We made a police report just now and don't now whether he has been arrested.

162
00:10:35,420 --> 00:10:36,270
Take me there right away.

163
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:36,890
Go.

164
00:10:36,910 --> 00:10:37,340
But...

165
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:38,110
You...

166
00:10:38,150 --> 00:10:39,190
Do you know him?

167
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,100
Stop asking me.

168
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,260
Just take me there.

169
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,120
Go.

170
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:43,250
Go.

171
00:10:53,170 --> 00:10:53,810
Do you want

172
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,920
to chop off those fingers yourself?

173
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:57,070
What do you mean?

174
00:10:58,340 --> 00:10:59,630
Tell you good news.

175
00:11:00,290 --> 00:11:01,170
I might have caught

176
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,020
Wang Zhishui.

177
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:04,960
This guy has the same name.

178
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:06,870
He might be the one you're looking for.

179
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:10,410
Okay.

180
00:11:10,760 --> 00:11:11,800
I'll send you the address.

181
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:26,410
Where is he?

182
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:31,840
Here.

183
00:11:34,310 --> 00:11:35,130
Are the police inside?

184
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,730
Yeah, they locked him inside.

185
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:48,890
Where is he?

186
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:51,830
Locked inside.

187
00:11:54,170 --> 00:11:54,960
You can't go in.

188
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,440
I'll kill this guy today.

189
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,170
The police are interrogating him in there.

190
00:12:02,870 --> 00:12:03,460
Besides,

191
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,050
you haven't even seen his face.

192
00:12:05,710 --> 00:12:07,090
You are not sure he's the right guy.

193
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,070
There aren't that many thieves called Wang Zhishui.

194
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:20,110
He's the one.

195
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:21,940
I would recognize him even if he has turned into ashes.

196
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:23,690
Be quiet.

197
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:25,980
Talk to the police later if you have something to report.

198
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:27,450
Stop making noise.

199
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:28,210
Hebei, Langfang.

200
00:12:29,280 --> 00:12:31,060
- Isn't he from Shandong?
- Hebei, Langfang?

201
00:12:31,990 --> 00:12:33,070
That's near here.

202
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,770
I can head home once a month.

203
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:40,990
Isn't he an orphan?

204
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:45,070
He really cheated the hell out of you.

205
00:12:48,530 --> 00:12:49,730
Take him back to the station for now.

206
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:52,840
Don't worry.

207
00:12:58,940 --> 00:13:00,130
Do you know how much I hate him?

208
00:13:00,890 --> 00:13:02,360
The clothes I wore when I carried him,

209
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:03,850
and the sheets and sofa cover

210
00:13:04,150 --> 00:13:04,990
he slept on.

211
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:06,890
I burned all of those.

212
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,100
Enough.

213
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:10,750
Say something serious.

214
00:13:11,820 --> 00:13:13,040
He stole from you twice.

215
00:13:13,570 --> 00:13:15,230
Did he leave any evidence behind?

216
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,530
Well, he did.

217
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,660
I just told you. I burned everything.

218
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,280
I burned everything.

219
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,560
I told you to put on records but you didn't.

220
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,050
If you did,

221
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,390
you could have handed everything over for the investigations.

222
00:13:32,380 --> 00:13:34,090
You lost tens of thousands.

223
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:35,930
That's enough to keep him in jail for a few years.

224
00:13:36,580 --> 00:13:37,700
Right now, he only stole three bottles of liquor.

225
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:40,020
Those cost less than ¥2,000 in total.

226
00:13:40,660 --> 00:13:41,890
That amount is not enough to get him sentenced.

227
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,690
At most, he'll be locked up in the detention cell for 15 days.

228
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:47,140
I don't want him in jail for years.

229
00:13:48,110 --> 00:13:49,420
I don't want to get my items back either.

230
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:51,150
I just want to catch him.

231
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,070
If he is really locked up for a couple of years,

232
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,220
how long will I have to wait for him to be released?

233
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,030
Fine, whatever.

234
00:14:49,930 --> 00:14:51,330
It's so late. Why don't you come back?

235
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:53,240
My work is piling up.

236
00:14:53,450 --> 00:14:54,630
I plan to sleep in the office.

237
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,140
You leave Yuan Ru at home alone?

238
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:56,610
No.

239
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:57,920
She's traveling abroad.

240
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:58,800
That's perfect.

241
00:14:59,550 --> 00:15:00,460
I just finished my work.

242
00:15:00,790 --> 00:15:02,480
My mom might wake up if I return so late.

243
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:04,460
Let me crash here for the night.

244
00:15:08,330 --> 00:15:09,300
Don't take advantage of this.

245
00:15:24,540 --> 00:15:25,940
What's the point of playing that game all day long?

246
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:28,520
Idiot.

247
00:15:30,170 --> 00:15:31,050
When I was in the army,

248
00:15:31,430 --> 00:15:32,940
electronic devices were prohibited.

249
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:34,920
Especially for snipers like me,

250
00:15:35,320 --> 00:15:36,440
it is important to protect eyesight.

251
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:39,780
It has been years since you left the army.

252
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:43,480
I don't see you have kept up with the times.

253
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:47,970
A mobile phone like yours

254
00:15:48,830 --> 00:15:50,340
can't even use WeChat.

255
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:57,350
Anyway,

256
00:15:57,710 --> 00:15:59,160
why haven't I seen your sister recently?

257
00:16:01,050 --> 00:16:01,780
Didn't I tell you?

258
00:16:02,020 --> 00:16:02,890
She's traveling abroad.

259
00:16:03,950 --> 00:16:05,790
But even during my training here,

260
00:16:05,830 --> 00:16:06,830
I rarely saw her.

261
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:10,160
What's that matter?

262
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:12,200
Do you miss her?

263
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,470
You don't like her.

264
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:20,290
Why keep her here?

265
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,010
Do you want to feel annoyed?

266
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,760
Isn't your sister your entire world?

267
00:16:26,870 --> 00:16:28,260
Why would you spare a thought for me?

268
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,020
I don't.

269
00:16:31,330 --> 00:16:32,270
I'm considering for both of you.

270
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,370
You can take a horse to water, but you can't make it drink.

271
00:16:35,070 --> 00:16:35,950
Since it is impossible,

272
00:16:36,770 --> 00:16:37,260
I might as well

273
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:39,000
encourage her to give up.
