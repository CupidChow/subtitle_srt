[Episode 20]

4
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:07,840
Eh!

5
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:08,789
Son.

6
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,440
Why are you back so early today?

7
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,360
My company let us leave early.

8
00:02:14,470 --> 00:02:16,550
Why didn't your company send any gifts this year?

9
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,870
They did.

10
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:19,240
Isn't everything here?

11
00:02:19,540 --> 00:02:20,010
No.

12
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:21,329
I'm not talking about these.

13
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:23,210
Doesn't your company

14
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,310
give you something extra every year?

15
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,079
Well.

16
00:02:25,320 --> 00:02:26,560
The smoked meat!

17
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:28,350
The one which I said was delicious last year.

18
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:30,310
Oh.

19
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,829
That.

20
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:32,440
Yes.

21
00:02:34,730 --> 00:02:36,110
I didn't receive it this year.

22
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,720
Maybe the company is getting stricter with rules.

23
00:02:39,270 --> 00:02:40,590
So they probably have prohibited favoritism.

24
00:02:41,030 --> 00:02:41,700
Eh.

25
00:02:41,730 --> 00:02:43,530
Why must that be the missing item?

26
00:02:43,660 --> 00:02:44,410
The company can't always

27
00:02:45,550 --> 00:02:47,400
send the same stuff every year.

28
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,560
You don't know

29
00:02:48,579 --> 00:02:49,860
it was insanely delicious.

30
00:02:54,790 --> 00:02:56,350
Such a sharp mother

31
00:02:56,350 --> 00:02:57,280
is terrifying.

32
00:02:57,790 --> 00:02:58,560
There're so many things!

33
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,750
She really remember everything.

34
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,920
Luckily, she bought my lie.

35
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:04,440
Mom.

36
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:05,680
I'm going back to my room.

37
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,480
Okay.

38
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,390
Go to sleep early.

39
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:08,080
Okay.

40
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:23,160
Call.

41
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,040
Folding?

42
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,560
I'll call.

43
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:29,540
Are you taunting me?

44
00:03:30,350 --> 00:03:30,870
Continue.

45
00:03:32,060 --> 00:03:32,860
All in.

46
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:34,170
Eh.

47
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,020
Let's have a gathering this new year.

48
00:03:36,740 --> 00:03:37,710
I'll be on duty tomorrow.

49
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:39,360
We can meet after you get off work.

50
00:03:40,270 --> 00:03:40,870
I have to work overtime.

51
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:43,970
Don't be a drag.

52
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:45,760
You just had a small misunderstanding with Peng Ze.

53
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:48,079
A drink is enough  for you to reconcile.

54
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:49,410
It's settled then.

55
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:50,880
I'll pick you up after work tomorrow.

56
00:03:53,550 --> 00:03:54,480
A straight.

57
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,940
I win.

58
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:31,320
Eh.

59
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:32,600
Do you still remember this?

60
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:34,670
When we were young,

61
00:04:35,230 --> 00:04:36,030
we three

62
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:36,909
stuck together every day.

63
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,270
We did everything together.

64
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,030
Awesome.

65
00:04:43,230 --> 00:04:44,340
Do you still remember

66
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:46,159
that tanned kid who had his dick snapped

67
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:47,990
while taking a dump?

68
00:04:48,430 --> 00:04:49,230
Several days ago,

69
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:50,590
I met him.

70
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,270
Guess what happened?

71
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,230
What?

72
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,590
That guy looks like

73
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:56,540
a lady now.

74
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:58,200
His skin is

75
00:04:58,670 --> 00:04:59,920
so fair.

76
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,390
Did you hear him?

77
00:05:01,870 --> 00:05:03,110
He doesn't notice anything else.

78
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,470
He's extra attentive to this.

79
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:11,880
Actually every time I met you guys when I was young,

80
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,030
I was furious.

81
00:05:15,950 --> 00:05:17,560
You were the best of friends,

82
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:20,110
and you always left me out.

83
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,410
While Dayu was away,

84
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,040
Yao finally

85
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,040
became friends with me.

86
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,770
Unexpectedly,

87
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,050
you're back.

88
00:05:34,870 --> 00:05:36,360
You two are still the best of friends.

89
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:37,720
That's true.

90
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:40,130
Our relationship is the closest.

91
00:05:42,150 --> 00:05:43,260
Anyway,

92
00:05:43,950 --> 00:05:44,550
when we were young,

93
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:45,520
we three

94
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,570
were always together.

95
00:05:46,950 --> 00:05:48,440
You are jealous about that!

96
00:05:50,590 --> 00:05:51,110
Dayu.

97
00:05:52,670 --> 00:05:53,860
Actually, after you left,

98
00:05:54,990 --> 00:05:56,070
this guy became a monk.

99
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,800
He used to

100
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:59,080
be so lively and energetic.

101
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:01,710
He could never stay still.

102
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:04,040
He was surrounded by

103
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:05,150
endless beauties.

104
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,720
There were enough people

105
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,840
for a barbecue party.

106
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:10,830
Once you left,

107
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,030
this womanizer

108
00:06:13,230 --> 00:06:14,230
became a monk.

109
00:06:15,430 --> 00:06:16,640
Actually during so many years,

110
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:18,070
I still haven't

111
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,810
get used to this.

112
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:20,790
Really?

113
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,640
Did he change

114
00:06:22,670 --> 00:06:23,510
because I left?

115
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:30,080
I don't believe you.

116
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,080
Let's have a drink.

117
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:38,870
Okay.

118
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,270
Have a drink.

119
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:45,560
Cheers.

120
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,200
Hey, Dayu.

121
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,390
What sounds does a kitten make?

122
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:51,070
A kitten.

123
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:54,920
Meow meow meow.

124
00:06:54,920 --> 00:06:55,960
What about a puppy?

125
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:56,750
Meow meow meow.

126
00:06:56,750 --> 00:06:57,310
A puppy.

127
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,520
Woof woof woof.

128
00:06:58,520 --> 00:06:59,360
Stop.

129
00:06:59,360 --> 00:06:59,890
Step.

130
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,910
Step.

131
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:02,190
Why is the sky dark?

132
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:03,600
Anyway,

133
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:04,710
you see.

134
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:06,520
The sky is great today.

135
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,550
There are stars in the sky today.

136
00:07:09,550 --> 00:07:10,390
Hey, Xia Yao.

137
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,200
Actually, I know that

138
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:15,440
you gave me the cold shoulder

139
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,640
because you hate

140
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:18,830
Li Zhenzhen.

141
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:19,830
Let me tell you.

142
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:21,980
I'm done with her.

143
00:07:22,390 --> 00:07:23,960
Right now, the lady I like

144
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:25,470
is starting to grow fond of me.

145
00:07:26,410 --> 00:07:27,130
Mr. Peng,

146
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:28,170
please get in.

147
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,270
Uncle Liu?

148
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:30,960
We...

149
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:33,350
We'll always be good friends.

150
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:34,830
Call me when you arrived home!

151
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,920
Get going. Bye bye.

152
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:36,480
Bye bye.

153
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,870
Look at him.

154
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,000
Stars!

155
00:07:42,860 --> 00:07:44,710
One, two, three, four.

156
00:07:44,710 --> 00:07:45,260
Yao.

157
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:46,270
Look.

158
00:07:46,659 --> 00:07:48,820
There are so many stars today.

159
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,110
Six.

160
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:52,380
Seven.

161
00:07:54,640 --> 00:07:55,520
It's late.

162
00:07:56,320 --> 00:07:57,550
Let's go home, too.

163
00:07:58,270 --> 00:07:58,870
Listen to me.

164
00:07:58,890 --> 00:07:59,650
Stand properly.

165
00:07:59,909 --> 00:08:00,630
Stand properly.

166
00:08:01,320 --> 00:08:02,950
Come on, I'll carry you on my back.

167
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:03,390
Come on.

168
00:08:04,070 --> 00:08:04,740
Here. Here.

169
00:08:10,230 --> 00:08:11,070
Where should I go?

170
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,000
Yao.

171
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:41,669
Don't you always bite others

172
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,600
when you're drunk?

173
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,230
Come on.

174
00:08:44,750 --> 00:08:45,520
Bite me.

175
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:46,640
If you do,

176
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,690
I'll be reassured.

177
00:08:51,850 --> 00:08:52,550
Great!

178
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,270
Delightful!

179
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:00,100
Why...

180
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,140
Why did you let go?

181
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:04,480
Have you become Wang Zhishui?

182
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:11,200
Thank goodness.

183
00:09:12,150 --> 00:09:12,750
Thank goodness.

184
00:09:30,470 --> 00:09:30,910
Who...

185
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:31,890
Who are you?

186
00:09:32,950 --> 00:09:33,570
Huh?

187
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:36,200
Didn't you carry me back?

188
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,350
I wasted so much energy

189
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,560
carrying you all the way!

190
00:09:51,770 --> 00:09:53,050
Get up!

191
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:59,000
What are you doing?

192
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,800
Get off!

193
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,300
Get off!

194
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,080
You...

195
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,610
How dare you bite me!

196
00:10:52,430 --> 00:10:53,470
This time,

197
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:54,550
I will absolutely not

198
00:10:54,550 --> 00:10:55,990
let you steal anything.

199
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:15,570
You can't escape now.

200
00:11:49,850 --> 00:11:50,450
Yao.

201
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,800
let me explain!

202
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,320
Stop talking that.

203
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:54,230
I don't know

204
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,350
how this happened!

205
00:11:55,350 --> 00:11:56,790
Stop blabbering!

206
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,690
Untie me first!

207
00:12:03,550 --> 00:12:04,040
Don't breathe

208
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,630
any word about this.

209
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,480
Let's pretend nothing happened.

210
00:12:07,950 --> 00:12:09,760
A-Actually,

211
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,170
it's fine for others to know it.

212
00:12:11,710 --> 00:12:12,630
I'll be responsible for you.

213
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,590
Screw you!

214
00:12:14,030 --> 00:12:15,110
Untie me quickly!

215
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:40,480
Be careful.

216
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,430
Don't make the boss notice us.

217
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:44,440
Stop being anxious?

218
00:12:44,440 --> 00:12:45,150
What for?

219
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:46,810
You asked me to

220
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,830
to find Wang Zhishui's address

221
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:48,870
last time.

222
00:12:49,350 --> 00:12:50,110
This is the information.

223
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,200
His aunt

224
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,080
and uncles

225
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:53,940
also live there.

226
00:12:54,270 --> 00:12:54,990
Their information is also in there.

227
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:56,850
Damn.

228
00:12:57,650 --> 00:12:58,850
You're so considerate.

229
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,550
I'll treat you to a meal.

230
00:13:00,550 --> 00:13:00,950
Never mind.

231
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:01,850
No need to treat me a meal.

232
00:13:05,750 --> 00:13:07,390
Yongqing County, Langfang City.

233
00:13:18,430 --> 00:13:18,960
Yong

234
00:13:18,960 --> 00:13:19,670
Qing

235
00:13:19,670 --> 00:13:20,470
County

236
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:24,110
If we want to find him,

237
00:13:24,570 --> 00:13:25,760
it will take more than ten hours.

238
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:27,960
I'm on leave tomorrow.

239
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:29,320
According to the current situation,

240
00:13:30,010 --> 00:13:31,540
we need to set off tonight

241
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:33,710
if we want to wrap this up in a day.

242
00:14:20,250 --> 00:14:21,490
If I can catch Wang Zhishui

243
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,820
on this trip,

244
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:25,280
how should I teach him a lesson?

245
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,010
Should I beat him up

246
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,520
to end this grudge

247
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:31,480
or tell his family

248
00:14:31,510 --> 00:14:32,750
about his crimes

249
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:34,550
to humiliate him for life?

250
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,270
Do you have the unit number?

251
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:37,720
It's not written here.

252
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:39,980
I can't drive any farther.

253
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,390
You two go to ask around.

254
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:45,020
Let's go this way.

255
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:14,300
Hey.

256
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:14,830
Uncle!

257
00:16:15,310 --> 00:16:15,800
Uncle!

258
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:17,150
Can I ask you something?

259
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:18,980
Do you know where Wang Zhishui lives?

260
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,310
Wang Zhishu?

261
00:16:21,370 --> 00:16:21,840
Yes.

262
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:23,440
Do we have someone called Wang Zhishui in this village?

263
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:27,940
Excuse me.

264
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,440
Brother.

265
00:16:28,670 --> 00:16:29,680
I want ask you about someone.

266
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:31,580
Do you know where Wang Zhishui lives?

267
00:16:32,430 --> 00:16:33,110
I don't know him.

268
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,890
His father's name is Wang Kaicai.

269
00:16:40,270 --> 00:16:41,110
His mother's name is

270
00:16:41,640 --> 00:16:42,520
Li Chunqing.

271
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:44,950
Who are you?

272
00:16:45,350 --> 00:16:46,840
Why are you asking about them?

273
00:16:47,070 --> 00:16:47,830
Wang Zhishui.

274
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,340
His mother's name is Li Chunqing.

275
00:16:50,730 --> 00:16:51,360
Sorry.

276
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,000
I don't know him.

277
00:16:55,760 --> 00:16:56,620
Uh...

278
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,060
Wang Zhishui is my friend.

279
00:16:58,860 --> 00:16:59,280
Well.

280
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:00,650
I really don't know him.

281
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:01,320
I also don't know them.

282
00:17:09,970 --> 00:17:11,130
How can I find him?

283
00:17:32,430 --> 00:17:33,130
Brother.

284
00:17:33,710 --> 00:17:34,310
Excuse me.

285
00:17:34,330 --> 00:17:34,920
Do you know

286
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:35,970
where Wang Zhishui lives?

287
00:17:36,230 --> 00:17:37,160
I don't know. I don't know.

288
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:38,740
Thanks.

289
00:18:15,350 --> 00:18:15,750
Hey.

290
00:18:15,780 --> 00:18:16,430
Aunt. Aunt.

291
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:16,980
Hey.

292
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:18,680
Do you know Wang Zhishui?

293
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:19,460
No.

294
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:20,020
I don't know.

295
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,320
Hey.

296
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:26,870
Uncle.

297
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:27,880
Can I ask you something?

298
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,360
Do you know where Wang Zhishui lives?

299
00:18:29,380 --> 00:18:30,160
I don't know.

300
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:42,170
How about you?

301
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,070
Have you found him?

302
00:18:43,310 --> 00:18:43,910
No.

303
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:45,670
It's the same with me.

304
00:18:46,470 --> 00:18:47,170
I have asked everyone.

305
00:18:47,350 --> 00:18:48,210
I've looked all over there.

306
00:18:48,350 --> 00:18:49,060
No one knows him.

307
00:18:50,470 --> 00:18:51,110
How about there?

308
00:18:51,710 --> 00:18:52,680
We haven't searched there yet.

309
00:18:53,230 --> 00:18:53,620
Go.

310
00:18:53,830 --> 00:18:54,370
Have a look there.

311
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,160
Have you found him?

312
00:19:09,870 --> 00:19:10,970
How horrible his relations are.
