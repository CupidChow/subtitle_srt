[Episode 11]

4
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:54,090
Come in if you want to have a look.

5
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:55,520
Don't sneak around.

6
00:03:04,020 --> 00:03:05,020
Such a jack-of-all-trades.

7
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:16,640
I just bumped into a guy hard to please.

8
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:19,970
Thank you.

9
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,620
Why?

10
00:03:22,010 --> 00:03:22,820
I never said these were for you.

11
00:03:30,090 --> 00:03:30,930
What will you do during the National Day holiday?

12
00:03:32,690 --> 00:03:33,810
I have to be on duty.

13
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,590
I only have two days off.

14
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,240
I can't travel far.

15
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,500
But anywhere nearby is crowded.

16
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,930
I can only hang out with some friends,

17
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,400
to play cards and shop.

18
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:44,880
Shopping is for ladies.

19
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:45,900
Let me take you to a place.

20
00:04:59,510 --> 00:05:00,450
How about I take you on a ride by the Yellow River

21
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:01,770
with this car?

22
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:07,800
Let me have a try first.

23
00:05:38,450 --> 00:05:39,090
Wow.

24
00:05:39,830 --> 00:05:40,280
How about it?

25
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,420
Do you want to go with me?

26
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:43,190
I don't want to ride your bike.

27
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:44,480
I'll buy one for myself.

28
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:46,090
I modified this myself.

29
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:47,170
It's one-of-a-kind in the world.

30
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:49,020
Such great parts can't be bought anywhere.

31
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:51,780
You are bragging.

32
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:57,710
Will you go with me?

33
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,280
Talk about it later.

34
00:06:21,390 --> 00:06:22,110
Here, sit down please.

35
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:29,880
Mr. Xia.

36
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:31,870
All the surveillance footage at that night

37
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:32,590
is here.

38
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:58,110
That's odd.

39
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:01,160
Xuan Dayu was the one who carried me out.

40
00:07:02,260 --> 00:07:04,190
How did I end up on Yuan Zong's back?

41
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,290
Leaving aside the method,

42
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:43,830
we just talk about the strength.

43
00:07:43,990 --> 00:07:44,900
So terrifying.

44
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,990
Two adult men were hurled about

45
00:07:47,220 --> 00:07:48,620
like this.

46
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:52,250
That bastard!

47
00:07:52,850 --> 00:07:53,980
How dare he mess around with me!

48
00:07:57,630 --> 00:07:58,140
Forget it.

49
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,670
It's gone.

50
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:01,600
There's no point in harping on this.

51
00:08:02,380 --> 00:08:04,420
Investigating Wang Zhishui is the most important.

52
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:06,810
That's the real reason why we're checking the surveillance footage.

53
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:19,730
Now,

54
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:21,300
that guy won't be able to escape now.

55
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:24,900
Manager,

56
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,000
give me these two photos.

57
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,250
Okay, no problem.

58
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:39,350
I have had someone to investigate.

59
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:40,770
There isn't anyone in Beijing

60
00:08:41,190 --> 00:08:42,200
who fits the description.

61
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:43,880
That's impossible.

62
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,020
His spoke Beijing dialect well.

63
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,300
His accent tells he's definitely from Beijing.

64
00:08:48,730 --> 00:08:49,570
Why can't we find him?

65
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:52,660
Did he grow up in Beijing

66
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:54,460
but transferred his household registration to elsewhere?

67
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:56,200
No way.

68
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:57,840
If someone like him

69
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,740
has a household registration in Beijing,

70
00:09:00,010 --> 00:09:01,250
that's already a blessing.

71
00:09:01,270 --> 00:09:02,220
Why would he possibly transfer his registration?

72
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,880
Was his identity card fake?

73
00:09:06,690 --> 00:09:07,970
Are you saying that

74
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:09,900
he had been targeting me long time ago?

75
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:11,810
Yes.

76
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,150
Why are you so sure of that?

77
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:16,950
Didn't you tell me that?

78
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,410
You just returned to Beijing.

79
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:21,150
He was not able to

80
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,030
target you so quickly.

81
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,940
Do you have the surveillance footage?

82
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,900
Let me take a look.

83
00:09:26,660 --> 00:09:27,250
You don't have to watch that.

84
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:27,940
You lost.

85
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,390
I

86
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:31,290
already took a look.

87
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:33,460
We didn't leave together.

88
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,490
You were walking

89
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,900
with him side by side.

90
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:38,960
You directly

91
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:40,170
carried him on your back.

92
00:09:41,260 --> 00:09:42,540
In that case,

93
00:09:42,590 --> 00:09:43,870
I took the initiative to approach him?

94
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,900
That's just like digging my own grave.

95
00:09:50,130 --> 00:09:50,750
Stop thinking about that.

96
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:52,040
Don't talk about him anymore.

97
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:53,550
Tell me more about yourself.

98
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:55,540
Where have you been hanging out these days?

99
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:58,690
Don't mention it.

100
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,360
You've been busy.

101
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:03,530
So I asked Peng Ze to go on a drive.

102
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:04,970
Guess what happened.

103
00:10:05,780 --> 00:10:06,720
Such a traffic jam.

104
00:10:08,310 --> 00:10:10,160
I'm never going out during the holidays.

105
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,720
Isn't it the weekend soon?

106
00:10:14,340 --> 00:10:16,130
Call some friends

107
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:16,980
to play cards.

108
00:10:17,670 --> 00:10:18,850
I have been out of contact with them for long time.

109
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:21,910
You go.

110
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:23,740
These days,

111
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:24,760
I'm exhausted.

112
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,090
I just want to rest

113
00:10:27,340 --> 00:10:28,150
at home.

114
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:30,340
Well.

115
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:31,780
Have a good rest.

116
00:10:32,330 --> 00:10:33,130
You seem quite worn out.

117
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,190
Come on.

118
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:35,810
One more match.

119
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:41,120
What's up?

120
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:41,970
Have you made up your mind?

121
00:10:42,750 --> 00:10:43,750
Let's make a deal.

122
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:45,150
The goal of this trip is

123
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:46,350
primarily to go on a ride,

124
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,470
supplemented by sightseeing.

125
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:48,790
We'll return on the same day.

126
00:10:49,180 --> 00:10:50,420
We absolutely can't spend a night there.

127
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,340
So...

128
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,980
Let's set off

129
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:55,280
at 4 a.m. tomorrow.

130
00:10:56,370 --> 00:10:57,980
Thus, we'll reach the Yellow River at noon.

131
00:10:58,670 --> 00:10:59,320
We can enjoy the breeze

132
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:00,190
and barbecue.

133
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:01,910
We can drive back in the afternoon.

134
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:04,020
Then we'll reach Beijing by nightfall.

135
00:11:06,710 --> 00:11:07,930
So you can't be late.

136
00:11:09,050 --> 00:11:09,990
I'll cancel the trip if you're late.

137
00:11:48,910 --> 00:11:49,920
Beijing is strict on road safety.

138
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:50,830
You don't have a license.

139
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:51,570
Let me drive.

140
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,860
I'll take your place once we're out of Beijing.

141
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:10,570
Don't fall asleep.

142
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,080
Stay awake.

143
00:12:14,900 --> 00:12:15,780
Don't fall down.

144
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:17,880
This isn't a human's shoulders.

145
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,330
This is the most dangerous place.

146
00:12:19,650 --> 00:12:21,210
If you lay on that, you'll die...

147
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,070
Where are we?

148
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:02,840
We just left Beijing.

149
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:04,530
We're probably in Hebei.

150
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:06,070
What?

151
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:08,710
We have driven for so long, but we just left Beijing?

152
00:13:09,790 --> 00:13:11,500
When will we reach Henan?

153
00:13:12,740 --> 00:13:13,750
You drive so slowly.

154
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,550
Are you embarrassed to invite me to go for a drive?

155
00:13:16,310 --> 00:13:17,030
Go.

156
00:13:17,050 --> 00:13:17,490
Get off.

157
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:18,090
Let me drive.

158
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,440
That feels awesome!

159
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,030
So thrilling!

160
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,970
I'm losing my mind!

161
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,780
Awesome!

162
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,780
Let's take a break.

163
00:14:21,820 --> 00:14:22,370
Are you hungry?

164
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:32,520
What food do you bring?

165
00:14:33,540 --> 00:14:34,580
I have all the food you want.

166
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,180
Where is the food?

167
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:55,100
Tell me.

168
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,080
What do you want?

169
00:14:56,310 --> 00:14:57,270
I'll make it appear.

170
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:00,660
Give me a puff pastry.

171
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,210
Where did you get it?

172
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,400
I told you, it's magic.

173
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:24,170
You don't believe me.

174
00:15:24,950 --> 00:15:26,270
Do you think I'm

175
00:15:26,290 --> 00:15:27,130
as gullible as your sister?

176
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:29,080
You finally think of her.

177
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:29,820
My sister.

178
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:31,020
Don't mention her.

179
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:33,450
I came out with you to relax today.

180
00:15:34,210 --> 00:15:35,670
If you have other motives,

181
00:15:36,140 --> 00:15:37,500
I'll flag a cab and leave right away.

182
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,780
Making some beef balls appear.

183
00:15:51,230 --> 00:15:52,470
Phoenix roll with seaweed and pork floss.

184
00:16:04,060 --> 00:16:05,700
I don't believe the heresy.

185
00:16:05,870 --> 00:16:06,950
what else do you have?

186
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,330
I want a tray of steamed buns.

187
00:16:09,960 --> 00:16:11,250
Fresh ones.

188
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:13,130
Do you want me to get scalded?

189
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:19,050
You can't make that appear, right?

190
00:16:22,030 --> 00:16:22,910
How did you know

191
00:16:23,270 --> 00:16:24,520
