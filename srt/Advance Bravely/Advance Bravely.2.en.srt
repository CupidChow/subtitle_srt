[Episode 2]

4
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:12,430
What...

5
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:13,310
What would you like?

6
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:15,210
The same as him.

7
00:02:58,510 --> 00:02:59,460
Sir, your money.

8
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:02,450
Sir?

9
00:03:06,530 --> 00:03:07,830
Sir, your chewing gum.

10
00:03:42,079 --> 00:03:43,660
Why did he put it so deep?

11
00:04:42,490 --> 00:04:43,530
Why don't you look at the road?

12
00:04:43,550 --> 00:04:44,840
Why are you looking at me?

13
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:49,220
What a coincidence!

14
00:06:11,510 --> 00:06:12,300
It's him again.

15
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,460
Hey.

16
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:22,350
What's up?

17
00:06:28,670 --> 00:06:29,730
Lunatic.

18
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,410
Hello.

19
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,440
I'm followed by a bandit.

20
00:07:14,180 --> 00:07:15,750
I'm at the risk of being kidnapped at any moment!

21
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:33,610
Stop.

22
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,100
Look.

23
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,060
Screw you!

24
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:52,230
Take him down.

25
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:53,350
Yes!

26
00:08:05,790 --> 00:08:06,230
Get off the car!

27
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,160
I asked him to get off!

28
00:08:16,270 --> 00:08:17,420
Why are you two here?

29
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:18,580
Let's see

30
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:19,950
if you have the ability to ask him to get off the car!

31
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:37,159
Get away.

32
00:08:56,660 --> 00:08:57,120
Brother,

33
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,070
why did you ask for our help

34
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,030
since you're such a good fighter?

35
00:09:55,900 --> 00:09:57,310
Let's cut to the chase!

36
00:09:58,010 --> 00:09:59,370
Do you want revenge or blackmail?

37
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:00,590
Just tell me.

38
00:10:03,310 --> 00:10:04,090
My younger sister is interested in you.

39
00:10:04,890 --> 00:10:05,300
What?

40
00:10:05,860 --> 00:10:06,360
Yuan Ru.

41
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:08,700
A whole week!

42
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,980
He has followed me for a whole week!

43
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,960
I felt insecure.

44
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,360
I was anxious and terrified.

45
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:15,640
I wracked my brains.

46
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,070
I investigated and speculated.

47
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,460
Now I find out he's just trying to have a look at me.

48
00:10:22,850 --> 00:10:24,410
Are you two insane?

49
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:26,050
Tell your sister.

50
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:26,910
She have no chance!

51
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,970
Xiao Hui, do you have time?

52
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,070
I do.

53
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:51,870
What's wrong?

54
00:10:52,210 --> 00:10:52,900
Help me look into a person.

55
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:54,220
Look into a person?

56
00:10:54,370 --> 00:10:54,750
Who?

57
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:56,850
Yuan Zong.

58
00:10:57,790 --> 00:10:59,310
- He lives in our company–
- Yuan Zong?

59
00:10:59,870 --> 00:11:01,510
Yuan Ru's elder brother?

60
00:11:03,090 --> 00:11:03,780
Are you acquainted with him?

61
00:11:04,270 --> 00:11:05,330
I've heard others mention him before.

62
00:11:06,330 --> 00:11:07,560
Didn't Yuan Ru tell you that?

63
00:11:10,280 --> 00:11:12,000
Yuan Zong used to be in the special forces.

64
00:11:12,580 --> 00:11:15,330
After that, he set up his own bodyguard company.

65
00:11:15,630 --> 00:11:17,140
It's well-known in the industry right now.

66
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,900
It's heard that

67
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,650
the bodyguards from his company are very professional.

68
00:11:21,380 --> 00:11:22,660
They're mostly responsible for

69
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,070
guarding celebrities and politicians.

70
00:11:25,610 --> 00:11:27,330
No wonder those two in his car

71
00:11:27,350 --> 00:11:28,560
were such impressive fighters.

72
00:11:29,430 --> 00:11:30,800
They're professional bodyguards.

73
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:33,820
Thank goodness we cleared the air yesterday.

74
00:11:34,350 --> 00:11:35,580
We'll never cross paths again.

75
00:11:36,250 --> 00:11:37,480
I'll forget we ever met.

76
00:11:38,210 --> 00:11:39,330
However, here's something else I heard.

77
00:11:39,350 --> 00:11:40,050
Yuan Zong

78
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,090
raised Yuan Ru all by himself.

79
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:43,500
He took the role of both her brother and father.

80
00:11:43,610 --> 00:11:44,670
He treasures his sister more than his own life.

81
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,940
If Yuan Ru really has her eye on you,

82
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:49,530
you won't be able to get him off your tail.

83
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:03,760
Brother,

84
00:12:04,010 --> 00:12:05,090
do you know

85
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,150
what Xia Yao hates being called most?

86
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,530
Monk Xia!

87
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:15,270
Someone in his company told me that.

88
00:12:15,590 --> 00:12:17,170
As long as someone calls him Monk Xia,

89
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,950
he'll get in a terrible mood.

90
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:29,110
Brother,

91
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,700
can you do me a favor?

92
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:32,280
Say.

93
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:35,230
Xia Yao likes sweet food.

94
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:37,190
These are vanilla cookies

95
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:38,810
I made for him.

96
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Help me give it to him.

97
00:12:41,020 --> 00:12:42,580
He always rejects my gifts.

98
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,290
Only when you help me,

99
00:12:44,390 --> 00:12:45,530
he won't dare to reject it.

100
00:12:46,540 --> 00:12:48,000
After tasting my food,

101
00:12:48,020 --> 00:12:49,440
He might grow fond of me.

102
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,600
Right?

103
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,690
Don't eat these cookies secretly.

104
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:02,430
Oh.

105
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:03,950
I forgot that you don't eat sweet food.

106
00:13:04,500 --> 00:13:04,900
All right.

107
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:06,470
I'll leave it to you.

108
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,950
It feels great

109
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:05,090
without any stalkers around.

110
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,630
How can someone be so annoying?

111
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:30,870
Didn't I say that she has no chance?

112
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:32,910
Why is he here again?

113
00:14:50,760 --> 00:14:51,800
My sister has a gift for you.

114
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,440
I'll say it again.

115
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,200
I won't accept anything from her.

116
00:14:57,700 --> 00:14:58,880
I won't accept her either.

117
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,730
Tell her to give up.

118
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:03,040
I'm here only to give you this gift.

119
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:04,420
I won't be a messenger.

120
00:15:15,090 --> 00:15:15,510
OK.

121
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,360
If you are willing,

122
00:15:17,780 --> 00:15:19,180
follow me around every single day.

123
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:21,670
Let's see who gets tired first.

124
00:15:56,250 --> 00:15:56,890
What's wrong with him?

125
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,410
Why didn't he come to work these days?

126
00:15:58,500 --> 00:15:59,720
I heard he's sick.

127
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:00,970
He stays at home.

128
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,520
Oh.

129
00:16:06,610 --> 00:16:08,290
As long as I can avoid that idiot,

130
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:10,200
I can endure anything.

131
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:20,820
Excuse me.

132
00:16:49,870 --> 00:16:50,970
Screw you!

133
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:12,750
I get off a stop earlier.

134
00:17:12,910 --> 00:17:13,900
He definitely didn't expect it.

135
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,490
There was a bunch of people between us.

136
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:31,530
Even if you are a piece of paper,

137
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:32,360
you wouldn't be able to dash out here.

138
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,290
Did you trample over people to get out?

139
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:39,820
You got off at the wrong stop.

140
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:41,660
Do I need you to tell me that?

141
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,140
Brother,

142
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,240
can't you stop?

143
00:17:45,850 --> 00:17:47,490
I had a rather decent impression of you.

144
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,130
I thought you were a proper man.

145
00:17:49,990 --> 00:17:51,830
But why don't you have a backbone?

146
00:17:51,910 --> 00:17:53,400
How do you always let your sister order you around?

147
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:55,830
I advise you

148
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:56,950
to get on with your life.

149
00:17:57,540 --> 00:17:58,510
Stop butting into my life.

150
00:17:58,850 --> 00:17:59,650
If you're a proper man

151
00:17:59,890 --> 00:18:01,310
and don't want me to despise you,

152
00:18:01,660 --> 00:18:02,210
tomorrow,

153
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,280
don't come here.

154
00:18:04,470 --> 00:18:05,700
My sister has a gift for you.

155
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:08,850
Get the hell away from me!
