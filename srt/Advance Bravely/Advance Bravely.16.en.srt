Well...

00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:12,010
Yes.

I bought a windbreaker for my uncle.

How about you try it on for me?

00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:19,440
You two have a similar build.

Wow,

00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,240
it looks great on him.

12
00:02:40,090 --> 00:02:40,800
No, this won't do.

13
00:02:42,550 --> 00:02:44,200
I bet it will be too small for my uncle.

Doesn't that mean he's concerned about you, too?

really cares about you.

87
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,210
Of course.

88
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,670
Let me tell you this.

00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,050
Not a single man in the world

90
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:20,120
is on par with my brother.

91
00:06:20,140 --> 00:06:21,100
As a former

92
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:22,710

93
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:24,190
he's righteous and hunky.

94
00:06:24,420 --> 00:06:25,560
He even started his own company.

95
00:06:25,630 --> 00:06:27,170
That's astonishing and impressive enough.

96
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:29,930
I saw your brother on television once.

97
00:06:30,220 --> 00:06:31,290
He's quite handsome,

98

but...

99
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:35,780
he feels rather harsh.

100
00:06:36,430 --> 00:06:37,330
He seems

101
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:38,980
too hard to handle.

102
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,180
A real challenge brings a great sense of accomplishment.

103
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:44,000
Why don't you hook up

104
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:44,760
with all those obedient guys?

105
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:46,650
That's because they're too wimpy.

106
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:48,810
My brother hardly

107
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,630
falls for anyone.

108
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,700
But once he's in love,

109
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:52,540
he'll be devoted for life.

110
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:54,490
So I always tell others this.

111
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,409
I'm not jealous

112
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:56,230
of gorgeous women.

113
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:57,560
The woman who can captivate

114
00:06:57,580 --> 00:06:58,960
my brother's heart is a true fairy.

115
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,000
I'll worship her like a goddess.

116

Look at how silly you are now.

117
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,760
That's why

118
00:07:04,790 --> 00:07:05,920
you should hurry up and try harder.

119
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:06,980
Marrying my brother

120
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,460
would be great.

121
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,370
He has a car and a home, and our parents are dead.

122
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,110
You don't have to deal with any in-laws.

123
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,010
Okay,

124
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:16,280
I'll give it a shot.

125
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:17,950
But...

126
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,710
what if your brother doesn't fall for me?

127
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:21,400
I won't have any chance.

128
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,670
Don't worry about that.

00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:29,270
The food here

130

131
00:07:32,220 --> 00:07:33,960
My brother cooks far better than this.

132
00:07:35,100 --> 00:07:35,830

it's nice.

140
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,250
The food tastes good too.

141

Don't worry.

146
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:05,040
I sent him a message.

Okay.

148
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,420
It would be awkward if you didn't.

161
00:10:09,290 --> 00:10:10,050
Come over here first.

162
00:10:30,670 --> 00:10:31,120
What is it?

163
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,400
Fold them again.

164
00:10:34,710 --> 00:10:35,640

165
00:10:36,490 --> 00:10:37,120
Look at that.

166
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,620
No wonder you're single.

What should I do?

179

180
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:17,390
Did you tell him?

181

Don't worry.

182
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,570
I already texted him.

184
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:21,320
Oh,

185
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:21,890
look.

186
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,200
My brother is over there.

187
00:12:24,250 --> 00:12:25,480
Gosh.

188
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:28,600
What a rare sight.

189
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:30,840

190

191
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:33,960
He has

192
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:35,940
never worn such clothes.

193
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,680
I'm not lying.

194
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,340
He doesn't even wear the ones I buy for him.

195
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:39,560
This just shows

196
00:12:39,610 --> 00:12:41,010
how much he cares about meeting you.

197
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,880
This man

198
00:12:42,970 --> 00:12:44,300
is unexpectedly...

199
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:44,770
Brother.

200
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,070
hard to handle.

201
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,170
My goodness.

202
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,370
- That guy beside him is also very handsome.
- Your sister called for you.

203
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:52,090
He looks like a celebrity.

204
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,270
What...

205
00:12:53,560 --> 00:12:54,690
What's his name?

206
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,200
That's the dysfunctional guy.

207
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,340
Oh.

208
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,070
What a waste.

209
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:05,680
Brother,

210
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:06,950
let me introduce her to you.

211
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,360
She's Wang Shuang,

212
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:09,880
the one I texted you about.

213
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,130
Nice to meet you.

214
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:18,760
Mr. Yuan,

215
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:19,760
come over here for a minute.

216
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,430
Excuse me,

217
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:21,650
You guys chat.

218
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,620
Your brother's grip is insane. My hand still hurts.

219
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:27,880
Now

220
00:13:27,900 --> 00:13:29,260
my hand still hurts.

221
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,800
I'm busy,

222
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:31,760
so I need to leave.

223
00:13:31,790 --> 00:13:32,970
When my brother comes back,

224
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:34,110
have a nice chat with him.

225
00:13:34,620 --> 00:13:35,540
Why are you leaving me

226
00:13:35,570 --> 00:13:36,650
here alone?

227
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:39,120
You're the one having a blind date with him.

228
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:40,810
Why do you need a third wheel like me around?

229
00:13:40,900 --> 00:13:41,850
Besides,

230
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,510
I have my own tasks to get on with.

231
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:46,400
Good luck.

232
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,000
I agree.

233
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,680
In that case,

234
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,680
train them well.

235
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:52,590
Okay.

236
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:56,030
You have to

237
00:13:56,050 --> 00:13:56,850
be strict with new trainees.

238
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:57,760
Did you miss me?

239
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,490
Make sure they remember the main points.

240
00:13:58,520 --> 00:13:59,050
Miss you?

241
00:13:59,120 --> 00:13:59,480
Never. Get lost.

242
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,150
I'll organize some lessons

243
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:03,190
for them and train them well.

244
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:25,600
So...

245
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,750
Your hand is huge.

246
00:14:30,890 --> 00:14:32,490
Your feet are pretty huge too.

247
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:33,770
You're also tall.

248
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:37,240
Everything about you is big.

249
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:39,360
Sister,

250
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:40,800
don't you have any respect for others?

251
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:44,640
How can I help you?

252
00:14:45,390 --> 00:14:46,390
What does he mean?

253
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,380
I'm here for a blind date with you.

254
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:49,750
Why are you asking me that?

255
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,200
Didn't

256
00:14:51,200 --> 00:14:52,680
Yuan Ru convey the message clearly?

257
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:54,420
Could it be...

258
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,360
he's subtly trying to

259
00:14:56,360 --> 00:14:58,050
reject me?

260
00:14:59,400 --> 00:15:00,310
Didn't Yuan Ru

261
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,790
text you

262
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:03,150
about bringing me here?

263
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,570
I didn't read her message.

264
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:08,000
She even said he dressed up for me.

265
00:15:08,310 --> 00:15:09,600
Yuan Ru can't be trusted.

266
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:11,260
Fine,

267
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,300
I'll assume he's had an inkling

268
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,710
that he'd be

269
00:15:14,710 --> 00:15:16,010
meeting the first woman of his life.

270
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,640
That must be why he's dressed like this.

271
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,280
Since I've come here

272
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,310
to meet him,

273
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:22,730
I'll regret

274
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,680
not doing my best.

275
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:25,530
Here's the thing.

276
00:15:26,040 --> 00:15:27,280
My friend's company

277
00:15:27,280 --> 00:15:28,000
wants to

278
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:28,790
advertise your company.

279
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:30,160
Would you be interested in this?

280
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:33,000
Our company has a dedicated marketing department.

281
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,220
You can contact the marketing manager.

282
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,600
But I just wanted to speak with you.

283
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,240
That's because...

284
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:42,120
my friend

285
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:43,820
doesn't just want to advertise your company.

286
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,640
He wants to advertise your company's leaders.

287
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,840
So he hopes

288
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:47,710
I can speak with

289
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:49,060
the company representative.

290
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,530
Besides,

291
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:51,480
I'm not

292
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,880
part of public relations.

293
00:15:52,990 --> 00:15:55,340
Contacting your marketing department

294
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:56,140
doesn't seem appropriate.

295
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:00,530
Please come this way.

296
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:08,760
Who is that beautiful girl?

297
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:09,920
- She keeps blabbering.
- All right, enough.

298
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:10,200
Xia Yao,

299
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:10,960
take a break.

300
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,610
You're in poor condition today.

301
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:25,160
What's on your mind?

302
00:16:27,170 --> 00:16:27,970
We've been watching him

303
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:29,810
and his brother-in-law all this time.

304
00:16:30,070 --> 00:16:31,160
The star has finally arrived.

305
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:32,750
I'm not thinking about anything.

306
00:16:34,180 --> 00:16:35,750
You're surprised that I'm here, aren't you?

307
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:38,370
Yes, that was unexpected.

308
00:16:39,930 --> 00:16:40,880
I prepared

309
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:43,230
a surprise for you today.

310
00:16:43,270 --> 00:16:44,200
Forget it.

311
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,640
All you bring are shocks,

312
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:46,490
not surprises.

313
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,580
But

314
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:49,120
this surprise

315
00:16:49,160 --> 00:16:51,770
comes at a small price.

316
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,280
I'm going back to my training.

317
00:16:54,870 --> 00:16:55,870
Don't go.

318
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:57,550
This small price

319
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,930
is nothing compared to...

320
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:01,960
your many months of tough training here.

321
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,099
Are these related?

322
00:17:10,390 --> 00:17:11,030
What are you doing?

323
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:11,839
Mr. Xia,

324
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:13,720
don't refuse Miss Yuan's kindness.

325
00:17:13,819 --> 00:17:14,730
She spent loads of time

326
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,970
and effort on this amazing gift.

327
00:17:15,990 --> 00:17:16,589
Let go of me.

328
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,260
Let go.
