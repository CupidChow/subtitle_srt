Chief Instructor.

5
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:09,910
Xia Yao slacked off for twenty minutes during fitness training.

6
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:11,900
Okay.

7
00:02:12,140 --> 00:02:12,570
Got it.

8
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:16,390
Chief Instructor.

9
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,340
Xia Yao left without permission to pick up a call

10
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,870
and failed to finish his task on time.

11
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:21,910
Understood.

12
00:02:28,570 --> 00:02:29,300
Chief Instructor,

13
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:30,980
our disciplinary rules state

14
00:02:31,190 --> 00:02:32,430
that you should kick him three times

15
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,310
and hit him twice with a stick.

16
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:33,890
You should also

17
00:02:34,010 --> 00:02:34,840
confiscate his mobile phone.

18
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:15,220
Mr. Xia.

19
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,590
What are you doing?

20
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:17,800
It's fine.

21
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:18,520
Do you want some?

22
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:19,850
Here you go.

23
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:21,010
Thanks.

24
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:21,710
It tastes great.

25
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:24,870
Did you see that?

26
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:26,420
His pockets

27
00:03:26,980 --> 00:03:27,950
are full again after he went out.

28
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:29,460
That young man.

29
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,550
All right.

30
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:50,060
All of you, take a five-minute break.

31
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,050
Mr. Yuan,

32
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:57,070
it's the eve of the Mid-Autumn Festival.

33
00:03:57,480 --> 00:03:59,310
Many companies end work at noon.

34
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:00,940
Let's cancel training

35
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,230
this afternoon

36
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,290
and gather lotus roots as a team.

37
00:04:03,870 --> 00:04:04,530
You can gather lotus roots

38
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:05,460
after training ends.

39
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,640
It's pointless to do it after training.

40
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:09,280
It's only meaningful if it's a team activity.

41
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:10,900
Exactly,

42
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,370
the sun would have set by the time training is over.

43
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,450
Everyone is in a hurry to head home at night.

44
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:14,860
No one would stay to gather lotus roots.

45
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:17,519
No means no.

46
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:18,920
The Mid-Autumn Festival is a public holiday.

47
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:20,230
You have all the time to relax.

48
00:04:20,950 --> 00:04:21,430
Right now,

49
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:22,520
we're in training.

50
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:47,170
These are the details.

51
00:04:47,750 --> 00:04:49,290
Make sure you complete all your homework.

52
00:04:50,409 --> 00:04:50,830
Class dismissed.

53
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,280
Are you also interested in gathering lotus roots?

54
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:16,030
No,

55
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:17,960
I'm just looking at those two birds.

56
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:42,420
Ready!

57
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:44,520
One!

58
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:46,300
Two!

59
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:47,950
Three!

60
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:49,560
- Stop.
- Four!

61
00:05:50,159 --> 00:05:50,680
Assemble!

62
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:52,590
Hurry!

63
00:05:53,700 --> 00:05:54,100
Okay,

64
00:05:54,130 --> 00:05:54,790
everyone is here.

65
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,420
At ease!

66
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,110
Chief Instructor Yuan instructed

67
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:00,490
that this afternoon's training is canceled.

68
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,310
We'll be gathering lotus roots as a team.

69
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,310
Give me one!

70
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:20,180
Mr. Yuan,

71
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,190
here is the uniform you requested.

72
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:21,910
Get me another set.

73
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,470
Okay.

74
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:28,630
Let's go.

75
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:29,880
Come on.

76
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,510
Give me one!

77
00:06:32,140 --> 00:06:32,640
Mr. Yuan.

78
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:34,130
Get me another set.

79
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:34,730
Okay.

80
00:06:39,420 --> 00:06:40,250
Okay, get on with your task.

81
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,260
Xia Yao,

82
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:49,980
come over here.

83
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:52,520
Put this on.

84
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,140
Put on another pair of trousers too.

85
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:02,450
The water is cold.

86
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:03,210
Your legs will freeze.

87
00:07:03,340 --> 00:07:05,270
The ladies are only wearing one pair of trousers.

88
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,000
How can a guy like me be such a wimp?

89
00:07:42,070 --> 00:07:42,700
There's one here.

90
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:51,230
Help me.

91
00:07:51,540 --> 00:07:52,090
Give me a hand.

92
00:08:13,690 --> 00:08:14,620
What is this?

93
00:08:40,179 --> 00:08:40,929
Who are you fooling?

94
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:41,880
There aren't lotus roots here.

95
00:08:42,820 --> 00:08:43,470
Dig deeper.

96
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:49,170
Come here.

97
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,640
Are these lotus roots?

98
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:51,600
Don't move.

99
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:52,280
Let me do it.

100
00:08:59,660 --> 00:09:00,650
Wow!

101
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:01,700
You got it out!

102
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:04,990
Here.

103
00:09:05,900 --> 00:09:06,790
Let me try.

104
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:12,020
Big white lotus roots.

105
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,350
Big white lotus roots.

106
00:09:13,890 --> 00:09:15,710
Show yourself!

107
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,090
I got one!

108
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:17,820
I can feel it!

109
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:18,710
Look at this.

110
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:24,660
Look at this.

111
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:27,340
Stop bragging.

112
00:09:27,690 --> 00:09:28,150
Put it down.

113
00:09:48,390 --> 00:09:49,230
I got another one.

114
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,030
Another one!

115
00:10:27,110 --> 00:10:27,670
Look at these.

116
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,150
I dug all these up.

117
00:10:29,630 --> 00:10:30,010
Nice,

118
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:31,290
you're impressive.

119
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,220
Go.

120
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:40,040
You don't have to help me.

121
00:10:40,120 --> 00:10:40,680
I can manage.

122
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:41,160
Don't worry.

123
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:41,730
I won't

124
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:42,290
bother you.

125
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:07,790
Bye bye.

126
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:08,500
Bye bye.

127
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:09,250
- See you tomorrow.
- See you.

128
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,160
Bye.

129
00:11:35,350 --> 00:11:36,110
Take these home

130
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:36,920
for your mom.

131
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:42,920
Why did you get the kitchen to cook these for me?

132
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:44,880
I like them as cold dishes.

133
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:47,690
I didn't cook those.

134
00:11:47,790 --> 00:11:49,560
Mr. Yuan cooked them himself.

135
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,360
I've been working here for over a year.

136
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,680
This is the first time he's cooked anything.

137
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:56,110
You can't reject his kindness.

138
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:00,740
Is this brute's food

139
00:12:01,070 --> 00:12:01,720
even edible?

140
00:12:27,750 --> 00:12:28,260
Wow.

141
00:12:28,540 --> 00:12:29,030
Wow.

142
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,150
This lotus root with glutinous rice is delicious.

143
00:12:32,900 --> 00:12:34,430
It tastes even better than Auntie Li's cooking.

144
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:38,560
Try it.

145
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,580
She must be exaggerating.

146
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,880
Wow!

147
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,310
Right?

148
00:12:57,950 --> 00:12:58,470
Where

149
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,090
did you buy this?

150
00:12:59,160 --> 00:12:59,490
Well.

151
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:01,420
At a street stall.

152
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:02,980
Bring back more tomorrow.

153
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:04,380
It's

154
00:13:04,950 --> 00:13:05,930
Mid-Autumn Festival tomorrow.

155
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,750
People are celebrating at home.

156
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,100
I forgot all about that.

157
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,510
Well, buy more after the holidays.

158
00:13:10,530 --> 00:13:10,850
Okay?

159
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:14,700
This is delicious.

160
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,130
Son.

161
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,130
Come here.

162
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:41,220
Finish this hot drink before you leave.

163
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,200
Mom,

164
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,340
why are you cooking today?

165
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,610
Auntie went out.

166
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:49,240
Oh.

167
00:13:52,820 --> 00:13:54,300
Remember to buy the lotus roots

168
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,190
with glutinous rice from that stall.

169
00:13:57,620 --> 00:13:58,220
Okay.

170
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:06,150
Madam,

171
00:14:06,490 --> 00:14:07,280
one portion of lotus root with glutinous rice.

172
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:07,970
Okay.

173
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,450
How much is it?

174
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:18,090
¥20.

175
00:14:18,850 --> 00:14:19,370
Here's ¥20.

176
00:14:20,470 --> 00:14:20,970
Thanks.

177
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,860
I've been looking forward to this.

178
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:49,220
Are you messing with me?

179
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:53,950
That stall only opens on the weekends.

180
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,390
Well, buy it on the weekend.

181
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,720
Morning.

182
00:15:05,750 --> 00:15:06,040
Morning.

183
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,890
[Son, remember to buy the lotus roots with glutinous rice from that stall tonight.]

184
00:15:22,990 --> 00:15:24,570
Having a gourmet mom sure is a hassle.

185
00:15:26,410 --> 00:15:27,360
How should I ask him?

186
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:40,180
Hurry!

187
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:43,090
Faster!

188
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:47,240
Hurry!

189
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:50,820
Hurry!

190
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:51,260
Hurry!

191
00:15:51,810 --> 00:15:52,390
Faster!

192
00:15:57,360 --> 00:15:58,220
Faster! Guys

193
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:01,660
Speed up!

194
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:05,800
Faster!

195
00:16:09,570 --> 00:16:10,400
You guys over there!

196
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:50,080
Xia Yao.

197
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:50,450
