[Yuan Zong]

5
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,650
Hello.

6
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:21,600
Hello.

7
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,480
I'm dead tired.

8
00:02:24,430 --> 00:02:25,150
What did you do?

9
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:27,390
I was out having fun all day.

10
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:30,770
Well, go to sleep.

11
00:04:58,620 --> 00:04:59,690
What's wrong with you?

12
00:04:59,710 --> 00:05:00,750
Why didn't you knock before coming in?

13
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,130
Are you done staring?

14
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,550
Get out.

15
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:12,690
I'm warning you.

16
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:14,010
Peng Ze is out shopping.

17
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:14,950
He'll be back soon.

18
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:16,430
If you don't listen, I'll tell him.

19
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,100
Don't blame me for ruining your friendship.

20
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:18,610
I...

21
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:23,930
Peng Ze!

22
00:05:24,150 --> 00:05:25,170
Peng Ze! Help!

23
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,080
Your friend is crazy!

24
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:28,720
Peng Ze!

25
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:29,740
Yao'er.

26
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,480
Xia Yao,

27
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:32,350
what are you doing?

28
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,140
What's going on?

29
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:34,570
Peng Ze, don't stand there!

30
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,580
Help me.

31
00:05:35,659 --> 00:05:36,070
Oh,

32
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:36,820
Xia Yao!

33
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,580
Xia Yao!

34
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:42,400
Xia Yao! Let go!

35
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,600
Peng Ze, you're so useless!

36
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:46,070
All you do is brag to me!

37
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:47,740
Hold on, this is my friend!

38
00:05:48,170 --> 00:05:49,970
He... He's the best fighter here.

39
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,110
Even if Xuan Dayu and I join forces, we couldn't beat him.

40
00:05:53,750 --> 00:05:54,550
Xia Yao!

41
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,240
Get lost!

42
00:05:57,140 --> 00:05:57,890
Xia Yao!

43
00:05:58,320 --> 00:05:59,540
What's bothering you?

44
00:05:59,850 --> 00:06:01,060
Vent your anger on me!

45
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,680
He's too frail to stand your beating.

46
00:06:02,710 --> 00:06:03,680
Hit me!

47
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:06,070
Did you ever have a naked online chat with a guy?

48
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:07,380
What nonsense are you spouting?

49
00:06:07,980 --> 00:06:08,680
Eight years ago,

50
00:06:08,940 --> 00:06:10,650
did you have a naked online chat with a guy?

51
00:06:10,950 --> 00:06:11,840
Eight years ago?

52
00:06:12,060 --> 00:06:14,050
I can't remember stuff about myself from that long ago.

53
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,960
Why are you so certain that I chatted naked with others?

54
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:16,830
Wait,

55
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,910
what's this about eight years ago?

56
00:06:19,770 --> 00:06:20,560
You're the one.

57
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:21,860
I'm sure of this.

58
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,000
Your legs

59
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,090
are so girly.

60
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:25,190
Wait!

61
00:06:25,340 --> 00:06:26,110
Xia Yao!

62
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:27,660
Eight years ago,

63
00:06:28,150 --> 00:06:29,070
he was only thirteen years old!

64
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:30,530
How could he have virtual sex with you?

65
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:15,280
I want to confide in someone,

66
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:17,760
but I'll be a laughingstock

67
00:07:17,790 --> 00:07:19,140
if others hear about this.

68
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:22,240
No one

69
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:24,490
will understand the trauma this caused me.

70
00:07:40,170 --> 00:07:41,960
If this incident were to be made public,

71
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,040
he would probably be the only person

72
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:45,740
who wouldn't laugh at me.

73
00:07:58,790 --> 00:07:59,270
Hello.

74
00:08:00,090 --> 00:08:00,740
Hello.

75
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,920
I want to tell you something.

76
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:05,870
Yes?

77
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:06,950
Eight years ago,

78
00:08:08,270 --> 00:08:10,100
I did something very stupid.

79
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:17,960
That's basically...

80
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:19,690
what happened.

81
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,630
Is that all?

82
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:21,820
Yeah.

83
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:24,130
You...

84
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,470
Don't make guesses based on what you see.

85
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,760
You have to consider

86
00:08:28,790 --> 00:08:30,730
if such an act is in line with their personality.

87
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:32,640
One's personality

88
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,970
is formed once they're an adult.

89
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:35,289
Some things

90
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,919
aren't possible

91
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:37,710
for everyone.

92
00:08:38,450 --> 00:08:38,919
All right.

93
00:08:39,210 --> 00:08:39,929
Don't let your mind wander.

94
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:40,840
Go to sleep.

95
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:43,559
Okay.

96
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:44,760
Good night.

97
00:09:15,310 --> 00:09:16,150
Put your leg down.

98
00:09:17,510 --> 00:09:18,340
How rude.

99
00:09:24,860 --> 00:09:26,020
Do you remember what I told you

100
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,540
before I left on New Year's Day?

101
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:29,470
What was it?

102
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,520
What do you think it was?

103
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,970
I said that if you were still single

104
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,410
when I got back,

105
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:36,180
I'd be taking measures.

106
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:38,420
What measures?

107
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,260
Useless fool.

108
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:44,700
Why are you relying on your dad for your love life?

109
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,690
I've selected a good woman for you.

110
00:09:48,570 --> 00:09:49,460
She's very decent.

111
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:51,380
Find some time to meet her.

112
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:52,540
I'm not going.

113
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,150
Listen up.

114
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,510
You have to meet her

115
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:58,790
no matter what.

116
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,640
I've spoken to your superior

117
00:10:00,770 --> 00:10:02,010
and applied for a week's leave for you.

118
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:03,370
This week,

119
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:04,450
spend time with her.

120
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,110
Don't bother about anything else.

121
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:07,600
You've helped me apply for leave?

122
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:08,400
Yes.

123
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:12,780
Seven days.

124
00:10:13,410 --> 00:10:14,240
Seven days.

125
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:22,710
Who is it?

126
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,780
I'm your dad!

127
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,060
Why is a young man

128
00:10:29,150 --> 00:10:29,990
like only showing off his good looks?

129
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:31,590
You don't get it.

130
00:10:32,620 --> 00:10:34,140
Why haven't you contacted

131
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:36,020
the girl I selected to you?

132
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,750
Can't you see the scar on my face?

133
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,830
It's our first meeting.

134
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,800
I want to leave a good impression.

135
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:44,390
A scar on your face?

136
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:45,640
Where?

137
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,580
How is that a scar? I

138
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,430
can't even see it with a magnifying glass.

139
00:10:58,210 --> 00:10:59,270
You're the only one bothered by it.

140
00:10:59,390 --> 00:11:00,400
No one else will notice.

141
00:11:00,740 --> 00:11:01,700
You can't see it,

142
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,480
but others will notice.

143
00:11:04,070 --> 00:11:04,880
So troublesome.

144
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:28,770
What's wrong?

145
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:30,690
Why are you sighing?

146
00:11:31,430 --> 00:11:32,830
This kid

147
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,400
is too sensitive.

148
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,020
He's a man.

149
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:37,460
Why is he so concerned about grooming himself?

150
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:39,660
That's a good thing.

151
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:41,520
It means he's trying hard.

152
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,020
That's true.

153
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,740
Yesterday, I saw him

154
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:46,620
rummage through

155
00:11:46,620 --> 00:11:47,620
his clothes.

156
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:48,720
He was picking through them.

157
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:51,940
This time,

158
00:11:53,420 --> 00:11:54,580
he's probably taking it very seriously.

159
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:55,350
Yes.

160
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:04,620
Xia Yao.

161
00:12:34,590 --> 00:12:35,760
Why is our son

162
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:37,130
missing so early in the morning?

163
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:37,700
I saw him

164
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:39,290
leave with a huge bag.

165
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:41,310
He's probably on a date with that girl.

166
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:42,810
A large bag?

167
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:43,230
Yeah.

168
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:46,860
He must have brought along many gifts.

169
00:13:38,980 --> 00:13:39,670
There isn't any signal.

170
00:13:40,120 --> 00:13:40,830
Darn it.

171
00:13:42,090 --> 00:13:42,850
I should get going.

172
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:45,580
Wu.

173
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,220
Time to settle our debts.

174
00:13:49,830 --> 00:13:51,550
If you don't explain yourself clearly today...

175
00:13:55,460 --> 00:13:56,440
Let's watch this.

176
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,860
What's so nice about this?

177
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:04,070
Were you looking for me?

178
00:14:04,370 --> 00:14:05,650
Oh, no. I was told you were looking for me.

179
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,810
It's so late.

180
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,100
Why isn't our son home?

181
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,220
I bet he's shopping with that girl.

182
00:14:11,300 --> 00:14:12,060
Shopping malls don't close

183
00:14:12,060 --> 00:14:13,240
during the new year.

184
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,540
Some youngsters

185
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,440
even shop late into the night.

186
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:19,330
I couldn't even get through to his phone.

187
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:22,120
His phone always runs out of battery at this time.

188
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,870
Don't worry about him.

189
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,140
Aren't you leaving tomorrow?

190
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:26,520
Go and pack your things.

191
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,680
Come on.

192
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:37,200
Hey, Auntie.

193
00:14:37,740 --> 00:14:38,180
Auntie.

194
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:40,380
Auntie.

195
00:14:40,610 --> 00:14:41,680
Do you know

196
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:43,330
where Yuan Zong lives?

197
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:44,500
Who are you?

198
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:45,560
I'm his friend.

199
00:14:45,590 --> 00:14:46,630
I'm here to wish him a happy new year.

200
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:47,880
Oh,

201
00:14:48,180 --> 00:14:49,250
walk straight.

202
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,560
There's a sign ahead.

203
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:51,900
- A sign?
-  Turn left.

204
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:52,570
Turn left.

205
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:53,820
Walk 500 meters or so

206
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,000
and then turn right.

207
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,640
It is

208
00:14:55,670 --> 00:14:56,560
the second house you see.

209
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,170
Thank you.

210
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:00,600
The second house.

211
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,870
Am I supposed to turn left or right?

212
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,120
Damn it.

213
00:15:25,940 --> 00:15:27,120
Let's continue next time.

214
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:28,540
It's getting really late.

215
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:31,260
I'm heading home.

216
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,540
Rest early.

217
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:33,910
Bye bye.

218
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:35,340
Great.

219
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:36,010
Bye bye

220
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:36,910
Finally, some humans.

221
00:15:38,630 --> 00:15:39,590
Brother,

222
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,660
can I ask you something?

223
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:42,320
Do you know where Yuan Zong lives?

224
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:43,950
Yuan Zong.

225
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:45,020
Someone is looking for you.
