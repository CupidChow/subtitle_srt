[Episode 24]

4
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:04,710
I want to eat those meatballs, too.

5
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,150
Sure.

6
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:08,880
If you can catch it,

7
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,169
I'll toss it to you.

8
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:10,880
Okay.

9
00:02:16,340 --> 00:02:17,030
Ready?

10
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:17,950
Yeah.

11
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,060
Three.

12
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,460
Two.

13
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:21,660
One.

14
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:26,160
You're so mean!

15
00:02:27,190 --> 00:02:28,400
Xia Yao!

16
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,860
You did that on purpose!

17
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,630
You didn't look where you were tossing it!

18
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:32,300
One more time.

19
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,780
Nah! No more.

20
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,960
Where the heck are you?

21
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,530
In the Northeast.

22
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,620
It's so cold out there!

23
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:42,750
Why are you in Northeast?

24
00:02:43,220 --> 00:02:43,660
Hey,

25
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:44,470
I mean,

26
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:46,990
dd you really fall in love with that northeastern chick?

27
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,400
No way.

28
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,370
Call him back here.

29
00:03:04,100 --> 00:03:04,680
Okay.

30
00:03:14,770 --> 00:03:15,490
Xia Yao.

31
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,110
What are you doing here?

32
00:03:18,110 --> 00:03:19,780
-Is that girl looking for you? -If you don't get in, the food will be cold.

33
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:20,610
I'm hanging up.

34
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:21,430
I gotta go to eat.

35
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,890
Bye bye.

36
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:38,140
What are you doing?

37
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,020
Get in the house.

38
00:03:39,170 --> 00:03:40,600
Can't you see that I'm heading out?

39
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:41,790
Go on.

40
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:42,790
I'll be fine even if I'm alone.

41
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:43,350
Don't worry about me.

42
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:43,920
I mean.

43
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:46,570
Who's worrying about you?

44
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:47,480
Who do you think you are?

45
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:48,940
Is this your house?

46
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,350
Do you think you can come and go as you please?

47
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,120
I'm here to spend the holidays with you.

48
00:03:52,150 --> 00:03:52,940
What holidays?

49
00:03:52,940 --> 00:03:54,030
The Lantern Festival!

50
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:55,340
Have you forgotten

51
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:55,990
that it's the fifteenth of the first lunar month?

52
00:03:56,190 --> 00:03:57,700
No, I haven't.

53
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,360
but I don't remember agreeing to spend it with you.

54
00:03:59,510 --> 00:03:59,980
Hey.

55
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:00,990
Have you forgotten?

56
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:01,900
It was the fifth or the sixth of the New Year.

57
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,630
And you said you wanted to spend the holidays with me.

58
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,340
I was talking about that one particular day,

59
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,780
not today.

60
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:08,390
We already spent that day together.

61
00:04:08,390 --> 00:04:09,220
Why not today?

62
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:10,430
We already spent that day together then.

63
00:04:10,430 --> 00:04:11,860
Why must we be together today?

64
00:04:11,860 --> 00:04:13,290
That's because we spent that day together.

65
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:15,820
Don't quarrel with me.

66
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:17,100
Just get out of here.

67
00:04:18,300 --> 00:04:19,910
How can you do this to me?

68
00:04:19,910 --> 00:04:21,730
I even canceled my gig at the temple fair for this.

69
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,420
The wage today is supposed to be doubled!

70
00:04:23,670 --> 00:04:25,610
I made sacrifice for you!

71
00:04:26,170 --> 00:04:28,120
So you're saying I have something to do with you quitting your job?

72
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,740
Did I force you to quit?

73
00:04:30,110 --> 00:04:30,880
I mean,

74
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:32,540
I bought glutinous balls here to celebrate.

75
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:34,190
It's gonna be a waste if we don't eat them together.

76
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:35,900
Where are you planing to go during the New Year?

77
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,150
-Hey. -Come on.

78
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,350
Hurry and cook those glutinous rice balls.

79
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:42,420
Leave once you're done eating.

80
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,080
Roger.

81
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:53,730
Is it that delicious?

82
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,880
It's so sweet.

83
00:04:54,909 --> 00:04:55,510
Don't you think it's too sweet?

84
00:04:55,810 --> 00:04:56,420
Not at all.

85
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,690
When I was a child, I loved eating glutinous rice balls.

86
00:04:57,909 --> 00:04:59,390
Back then, my grandmother used to make handmade glutinous rice balls,

87
00:04:59,430 --> 00:05:00,670
and they tasted much better than the ones available elsewhere.

88
00:05:02,890 --> 00:05:04,260
Let's hang out in the afternoon.

89
00:05:04,670 --> 00:05:05,160
Nope.

90
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:07,780
Fine.

91
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:08,510
I'll entertain myself.

92
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,060
What's so fun about being alone?

93
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:13,420
Why can't I have fun alone?

94
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,350
I've always played by myself from childhood.

95
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:16,730
I don't believe it.

96
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:17,870
There are so many people on the street,

97
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:19,250
and they're all in pairs.

98
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:23,400
That's true.

99
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:26,390
I also went to the temple fair alone.

100
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:28,670
Everyone has their odd moments.

101
00:05:34,310 --> 00:05:34,790
Fine.

102
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:36,280
I'll hang out with you.

103
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:38,040
Joyrides, hitting on girls,

104
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:38,750
or clubs.

105
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:39,950
Pick whatever you want.

106
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:41,360
I'll pay.

107
00:05:46,650 --> 00:05:47,780
Wow, there are so many people here.

108
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:49,890
Please make way. Make way.

109
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:51,300
Hey!

110
00:05:52,630 --> 00:05:53,630
I don't get it.

111
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,620
You're here all the time.

112
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:57,560
How come you still came here when you're off work?

113
00:05:57,980 --> 00:05:59,460
Indeed, I'm here all the time.

114
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:00,430
But I never truly spent my time here.

115
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,750
When I was dancing and performing on stage,

116
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:03,940
my biggest wish was

117
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,380
joining the crowd down there

118
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:05,990
enjoying the show,

119
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:06,840
and buying some stuff.

120
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,700
It would be so much fun.

121
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,600
Come here.

122
00:06:16,340 --> 00:06:17,780
Such a loser.

123
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:24,750
It's so fun!

124
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:29,630
Hit it.

125
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:50,620
This is for you.

126
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,060
Wow.

127
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,350
I bought it for 47,000 yuan.

128
00:06:59,070 --> 00:07:00,390
If you want to sell it,

129
00:07:00,390 --> 00:07:01,660
you can raise the price.

130
00:07:02,980 --> 00:07:04,260
What does your family do for a living?

131
00:07:04,580 --> 00:07:05,780
Why are you so rich?

132
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:07,590
It's not your business.

133
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,060
Who's richer?

134
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:12,820
You or Xia Yao?

135
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:18,010
My family can't be compared to his.

136
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:19,270
What?

137
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:20,150
Then,

138
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:21,710
why does Xia Yao

139
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,090
look so poor?

140
00:07:23,740 --> 00:07:25,790
Some things can't be measured by money.

141
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:27,580
I'd rather

142
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:29,430
grovel and lick someone else's boots

143
00:07:29,550 --> 00:07:30,780
just to drive a fancy car.

144
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,290
You're helpless.

145
00:07:36,270 --> 00:07:37,430
It's so beautiful.

146
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:38,740
Is this really gold?

147
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,380
Hey, Wang Zhishui,

148
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:41,620
why are you so lame?

149
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:42,630
Give it to me.

150
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,540
My gosh, it really is gold!

151
00:07:43,540 --> 00:07:44,280
I'm taking it back.

152
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:45,180
I won't give it to you.

153
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:46,020
Hey, you said it's a gift for me.

154
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:47,180
How can you take it back?

155
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:49,950
Because I've never seen someone looks so jobless as you do.

156
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:04,940
Have a look.

157
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:06,060
Cheap prices!

158
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,340
How much is it?

159
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,150
Five.

160
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:11,500
What is this?

161
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,540
Come and take a look.

162
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:13,510
Five yuan for each.

163
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:16,670
Hey, how about 10 yuan for three of this?

164
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:18,220
Take one.

165
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:20,000
I'll give you a discount, don't go.

166
00:08:20,030 --> 00:08:20,820
Do you wanna play this?

167
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:21,430
Roller coaster.

168
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:22,060
I'm not playing that.

169
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:22,590
It's no fun.

170
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:23,900
It's thrilling!

171
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:25,620
Come on! Take a look over here.

172
00:08:25,620 --> 00:08:27,260
Five yuan for each. Five yuan for each!

173
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,740
Here! Take a look.

174
00:08:29,210 --> 00:08:30,010
Cheap prices!

175
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:32,760
Let's go.

176
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:40,059
Take a look at this one.

177
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,020
How much is this?

178
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:43,590
Six yuan.

179
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,340
Six yuan?

180
00:08:51,550 --> 00:08:52,100
Let's buy one.

181
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:52,590
Take a look.

182
00:08:52,590 --> 00:08:53,140
Take a look over here.

183
00:08:53,140 --> 00:08:54,140
Five yuan for each. Five yuan for each.

184
00:08:54,140 --> 00:08:54,720
Childish.

185
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,380
Ten yuan for three of this.

186
00:08:58,110 --> 00:08:59,150
Wow, let's get one.

187
00:08:59,150 --> 00:09:00,740
I'll give you a discount. Don't go.

188
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,750
Hey, take a look. It's cheap here.

189
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:05,500
Hey.

190
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,140
Come and have a look.

191
00:09:06,310 --> 00:09:07,250
Do you want some cotton candy?

192
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:08,570
Yeah! Sure!

193
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:09,670
I want some!

194
00:09:13,030 --> 00:09:14,670
Stickers! All kinds of stickers!

195
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:15,700
10 yuan for 3 pieces!

196
00:09:17,140 --> 00:09:18,740
I want to have this mushroom plushie!

197
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:21,230
Come and have a look.

198
00:09:21,230 --> 00:09:21,740
Sir,

199
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,950
how much is it?

200
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,110
Ten yuan

201
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:25,370
for 10 bullets.

202
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:27,140
And if you can hit the target five times,

203
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:29,210
you can pick whatever you want.

204
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:46,460
Take it!

205
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:53,430
You're awesome!

206
00:09:53,430 --> 00:09:54,670
Hey, sir!

207
00:09:55,220 --> 00:09:56,750
You haven't paid for the game!

208
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,510
Well, then.

209
00:10:52,510 --> 00:10:53,460
You can go home now.

210
00:10:53,460 --> 00:10:54,200
I'll walk you home.

211
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,400
No!

212
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:56,060
You should leave.

213
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:02,660
I don't need you to walk me in.

214
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,920
Go home.

215
00:11:05,740 --> 00:11:06,720
Just go.

216
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:08,710
Go.

217
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:09,780
I really don't need you to walk me in.

218
00:11:12,070 --> 00:11:13,660
I can go by myself. You should leave now.

219
00:11:13,660 --> 00:11:14,220
Come on.

220
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:14,790
Hey.

221
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:15,940
-It's fine. -You should go back now.

222
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:16,630
Go.

223
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:18,990
Darn it!

224
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,230
How dare you come back?

225
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:20,780
Come.

226
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,390
Come on in!

227
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:22,420
Get in.

228
00:11:22,420 --> 00:11:23,190
Mom!

229
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,900
It hurts!

230
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:24,830
Mom!

231
00:11:24,830 --> 00:11:25,410
Mom.

232
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:26,460
My friend is still here.

233
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:27,720
Will you stop embarrassing me?

234
00:11:27,990 --> 00:11:28,830
Am I embarrassing you?

235
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:29,760
Look at what you have done.

236
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:31,310
Do I need to think about how you feel right now?

237
00:11:31,370 --> 00:11:31,930
Auntie.

238
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:33,380
I asked Xia Yao come over.

239
00:11:33,630 --> 00:11:34,920
I had a family emergency and needed his help.

240
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,010
It's my fault that

241
00:11:36,030 --> 00:11:36,940
I didn't inform you in the beginning.

242
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,820
Couldn't he tell me first?

243
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:40,640
A call wouldn't take up much of your time!

244
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,710
He's intentionally trying to annoy us,

245
00:11:42,710 --> 00:11:44,230
-refusing to go to the blind date! I'll give you a lesson! -Blind date?

246
00:11:44,250 --> 00:11:44,660
I'll hit...

247
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:46,740
Auntie.

248
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:48,140
I made him come over.

249
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:48,970
At the time,

250
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,710
he called me to request a few extra days off,

251
00:11:50,860 --> 00:11:52,200
and coincidentally I needed someone to help out urgently,

252
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,390
so I called him over temporarily.

253
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:54,520
It was my fault that

254
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:55,970
he didn't inform you about this.

255
00:11:56,590 --> 00:11:57,100
Mom.

256
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:57,780
Look,

257
00:11:58,070 --> 00:11:59,420
I brought you some Harbin sausages.

258
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,780
His family made these themselves.

259
00:12:00,870 --> 00:12:01,530
And this,

260
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,350
smoked meat.

261
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:04,560
Weren't you complaining that we didn't receive any this year?

262
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:05,970
He made these for you.

263
00:12:06,620 --> 00:12:07,420
Smell it.

264
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,800
It's definitely as good as the stuff we received.

265
00:12:12,990 --> 00:12:13,630
Yuan Zong,

266
00:12:13,970 --> 00:12:15,090
did you really make these yourself?

267
00:12:16,350 --> 00:12:16,940
Mom.

268
00:12:16,940 --> 00:12:17,960
I even brought this back to you.

269
00:12:18,210 --> 00:12:20,040
The most authentic mountain delicacies from the northeast.

270
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,350
They're great for making soup and braising meat.

271
00:12:22,580 --> 00:12:23,870
I even brought back ginseng

272
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,640
and antlers.

273
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,170
All the best stuff from the northeast

274
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,460
are here.

275
00:12:28,130 --> 00:12:29,190
All right, all right.

276
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,300
Tell me

277
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,340
before you leave next time.

278
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,900
If you pull this nonsense again,

279
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:34,320
I'll twist your ears off,

280
00:12:34,350 --> 00:12:35,050
understand?

281
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,220
Yuan Zong.

282
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:38,770
Come here.

283
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:39,930
Have a seat.

284
00:12:40,150 --> 00:12:41,090
Come and have a seat.

285
00:12:55,090 --> 00:12:55,980
Does your ear still hurt?

286
00:12:56,580 --> 00:12:57,560
It doesn't,

287
00:12:57,820 --> 00:12:58,690
but it's burning.

288
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:01,210
You're a grown man.

289
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,610
Why does your mom still punish you?

290
00:13:03,180 --> 00:13:03,830
Alas,

291
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,150
an old woman

292
00:13:05,150 --> 00:13:05,780
like her is probably lonely.

293
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:10,130
What's up with that blind date thing?

294
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,900
During the New Year festival,

295
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:14,640
my dad set up a blind date for me.

296
00:13:15,030 --> 00:13:15,580
He wanted me to meet her.

297
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:17,220
Then?

298
00:13:19,170 --> 00:13:20,360
Nothing happened.

299
00:13:34,190 --> 00:13:34,830
Is it good?

300
00:13:37,540 --> 00:13:38,060
Hey,

301
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,090
did that guy

302
00:13:39,530 --> 00:13:40,970
really make these smoked meat?

303
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,260
Wow,

304
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,270
he doesn't seem like

305
00:13:44,270 --> 00:13:45,860
he can cook.

306
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:48,320
Then, you're totally wrong.

307
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:50,350
Not only can he cook,

308
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,150
but he's also quite the chef.

309
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:54,750
That sticky rice lotus root dish you often praise,

310
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,360
well, it wasn't something I bought

311
00:13:57,490 --> 00:13:58,550
He actually made it himself.

312
00:13:58,890 --> 00:13:59,630
Really?

313
00:13:59,730 --> 00:14:00,770
That's impressive, isn't it?

314
00:14:01,380 --> 00:14:02,110
Yeah, duh!

315
00:14:03,990 --> 00:14:05,910
What a good boy.

316
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:08,460
If any girl can marry him,

317
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:10,120
she must be very lucky.

318
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:14,600
What are you laughing at?

319
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,480
You should learn from him.

320
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:34,610
The number you dialed is busy now.

321
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:36,610
[Xuan Dayu]

322
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:44,420
The number you have called is busy now.

323
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,490
Weird.

324
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,650
Why can't I get through to his phone?

325
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,430
Where is this guy?

326
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:00,380
[Peng Ze]

327
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:05,670
What's up, Yao?

328
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,450
Hey,

329
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,410
do you know where Dayu is?

330
00:15:09,730 --> 00:15:10,530
I don't know.

331
00:15:10,940 --> 00:15:12,430
I haven't been in touch with him for a long time.

332
00:15:12,990 --> 00:15:13,500
What's the matter?

333
00:15:13,780 --> 00:15:15,020
I can ask around

334
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,190
if you're looking for him.

335
00:15:16,390 --> 00:15:16,960
It's fine.

336
00:15:17,190 --> 00:15:18,040
I'll do it myself.

337
00:15:19,540 --> 00:15:19,940
Okay.

338
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,430
What brings you here?

339
00:15:58,240 --> 00:15:59,470
I've been looking for you for quite a few days.

340
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:01,330
Why didn't you pick up my calls?

341
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,080
I also spent days looking for you.

342
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,990
Did you pick up my calls?

343
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:07,270
I was in the northeast back then.

344
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:08,610
Don't even mention about that.

345
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:09,750
I don't want to hear it.

346
00:16:12,550 --> 00:16:13,460
You're mad now, huh?

347
00:16:14,610 --> 00:16:15,640
You broke my heart.

348
00:16:15,740 --> 00:16:16,670
So I have erased all my longing.

349
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:18,590
Do you have to be that dramatic?

350
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:20,800
It's just that I didn't pick up

351
00:16:20,820 --> 00:16:22,060
your calls or chat with you.

352
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,790
Xia Yao, listen up.

353
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:26,140
It's not just about the phone calls.

354
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:27,920
What place do I hold in your heart?

355
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,870
And how much significance do you have in mine?

356
00:16:30,350 --> 00:16:31,390
You should think about it.

357
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,830
You've been hiding all kinds of secrets.

358
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,400
You should be well aware of that.

359
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,220
Rich Xuan!

360
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:38,220
Mr. Xuan!

361
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:40,020
Xuan, the rich guy!

362
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,500
Sir!

363
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,430
What are you doing here?

364
00:17:45,170 --> 00:17:47,270
I went to look for a famous store selling sour and spicy noodles.

365
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,590
The two bowls I ate yesterday weren't enough,

366
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:49,860
so I went to buy more today.

367
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,270
I brought them here for you to try.

368
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,640
Try it.

369
00:17:53,980 --> 00:17:55,550
I guarantee that it's spicy, sour, and flavorful.

370
00:17:55,970 --> 00:17:57,050
If you like rich tastes,

371
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,400
I have two extra packets of vinegar.

372
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:03,370
Piss off!
