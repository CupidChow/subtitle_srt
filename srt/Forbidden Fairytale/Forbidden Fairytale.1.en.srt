FORBIDDEN FAIRYTALE

2
00:01:06,333 --> 00:01:10,962
“Forbidden Fairytale”

3
00:01:12,631 --> 00:01:15,258
Once upon a time,
in a faraway land,

4
00:01:15,842 --> 00:01:20,013
there lived an ailing king
and his daughter, the princess.

5
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,462
The king, who loved his daughter dearly,
brought in a new queen for her.

6
00:01:28,063 --> 00:01:29,523
And after some time,

7
00:01:29,523 --> 00:01:33,652
when he died from his illness,
the princess was heartbroken.

8
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:39,449
The wicked queen kicked her
out of the castle immediately.

9
00:01:41,284 --> 00:01:43,161
The princess wandered,
and got lost,

10
00:01:43,328 --> 00:01:46,873
until she met seven dwarfs
who were living deep in the forest.

11
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:55,425
As she stayed with the dwarfs,
she began to feel that something was off.

12
00:01:56,675 --> 00:01:58,135
The dwarfs were...

13
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,344
Daddy!

14
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,305
Hi, Dan-bi!

15
00:02:02,347 --> 00:02:04,599
Is my precious daughter
back from school?

16
00:02:04,599 --> 00:02:05,142
Yup!

17
00:02:05,142 --> 00:02:06,143
My cutie!

18
00:02:06,143 --> 00:02:07,310
So cute!

19
00:02:08,645 --> 00:02:09,855
What are you writing?

20
00:02:09,855 --> 00:02:13,233
I’m writing the fairy tale
you love so much.

21
00:02:13,316 --> 00:02:16,778
When I grow up, I’m gonna be
a fairy tale writer like you.

22
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,197
You want to become
a fairy tale writer?

23
00:02:19,281 --> 00:02:21,158
I love it! That’d be amazing!

24
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:23,535
I’m so happy I could die!

25
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:29,332
It’d be so fun to write
fairy tales with you, right?

26
00:02:38,633 --> 00:02:42,554
Dad never found success
with his stories before he passed away...

27
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:46,391
but I decided to fulfill the dream
that he couldn’t achieve.

28
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,769
I will definitely succeed
as a fairy tale writer.

Children’s Literature Contest
Wake up, Thoma-Thoma,
a bright morning has come!

30
00:02:54,065 --> 00:02:57,777
Lost Thoma-Thoma,
chase your dream!

31
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:23,804
Good morning, Thomas.

32
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:32,270
Sleep well?

33
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:35,649
Good morning, everybody.

34
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:39,569
The characters in Dad’s fairy tales.

35
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:42,739
These guys cheer me on
no matter what I do.

36
00:03:47,202 --> 00:03:48,703
Remember what I told you?

37
00:03:48,703 --> 00:03:49,996
Don’t be late on your first day!

38
00:03:50,038 --> 00:03:51,540
I’m getting ready to leave!

39
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:53,750
Good, make sure to greet
everyone properly.

40
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:55,627
I worked hard to become
a public servant,

41
00:03:55,877 --> 00:03:58,171
so that I can focus on
writing fairy tales.

42
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:00,173
Dan-bi, first impressions
mean everything.

43
00:04:00,173 --> 00:04:02,008
I know! I gotta go!

44
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:04,052
Wait, what’s wrong with your face?

45
00:04:04,219 --> 00:04:06,096
Did you pull another all-nighter
writing fairy tales?

46
00:04:06,096 --> 00:04:07,222
Of course not!

47
00:04:07,848 --> 00:04:09,808
- Talk to you later, bye!
- Hey! Wait!

48
00:04:11,643 --> 00:04:13,562
Ha-neul

49
00:04:15,021 --> 00:04:15,939
Hello?

50
00:04:16,064 --> 00:04:19,042
Dan-bi, it’s your first day at work,
so I’ll give you a ride, come out.

51
00:04:19,067 --> 00:04:21,361
It’s okay, I’ll just ride my bike.

52
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:23,280
Hello?

53
00:04:24,948 --> 00:04:28,535
Ha-neul is a publisher friend
who is obsessed with fairy tales.

54
00:04:30,912 --> 00:04:33,582
Dan-bi, can you grab my bag
from the trunk?

55
00:04:34,374 --> 00:04:35,709
Uh... sure.

56
00:04:43,292 --> 00:04:45,878
Congratulating Dan-bi’s
First Day of Work

57
00:04:47,262 --> 00:04:48,722
Is he proposing to her?

58
00:04:55,228 --> 00:04:57,272
Congratulations on your first day!

59
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,318
Thank you.

60
00:05:01,985 --> 00:05:05,322
It’s a good strategy to have
a stable job while writing.

61
00:05:05,739 --> 00:05:06,907
You can do it, right?

62
00:05:06,907 --> 00:05:07,908
Of course!

63
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:08,992
I have to debut soon.

64
00:05:08,992 --> 00:05:11,369
A world-renowned fairy tale writer,
shall we go?

65
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:28,595
Resignation Letter
Six years ago,
when I first came here,

66
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:31,807
I was a raw, energetic man
brimming with vitality.

67
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,810
But for six years,
without any rotation duty,

68
00:05:34,935 --> 00:05:38,772
every new recruit hasn’t
lasted a month...

69
00:05:38,772 --> 00:05:42,984
in this heartless reality that destroys

70
00:05:44,569 --> 00:05:47,072
even human dignity,

71
00:05:47,322 --> 00:05:49,282
I can’t bear it any longer.

72
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:51,118
With tears in my eyes

73
00:05:51,409 --> 00:05:53,537
I submit my resignation.

74
00:05:56,331 --> 00:05:57,457
Resignation Letter

75
00:05:58,667 --> 00:06:00,836
Deputy Kang, did you pull
another all-nighter?

76
00:06:01,169 --> 00:06:03,171
You should sleep at home.

77
00:06:03,171 --> 00:06:06,466
I mean, your home is where you sleep.

78
00:06:06,466 --> 00:06:07,759
That’s why you’re so soft.

79
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,802
Did you go to the hospital?

80
00:06:08,802 --> 00:06:10,887
Yes, I’m about to go now.

81
00:06:11,012 --> 00:06:13,849
Are you protesting because
I haven’t rotated you yet?

82
00:06:13,932 --> 00:06:16,643
Don’t worry, we’re getting
a bright new recruit today.

83
00:06:18,603 --> 00:06:19,771
A new recruit?

84
00:06:20,021 --> 00:06:22,023
But I heard we wouldn’t
get one until next year.

85
00:06:22,023 --> 00:06:24,109
Since everyone keeps
running away, I thought so too,

86
00:06:24,109 --> 00:06:26,194
but someone specifically
requested to join our team.

87
00:06:26,361 --> 00:06:27,237
Seriously?

88
00:06:27,237 --> 00:06:29,739
Seriously, a position opened
in planning.

89
00:06:29,739 --> 00:06:31,533
You’ve always wanted to go there.

90
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:33,493
Planning department...

91
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,120
Survive three months,
and it’s yours.

92
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:39,875
So, make sure the fresh meat
lasts three months.

93
00:06:41,042 --> 00:06:42,377
Planning...

94
00:06:43,587 --> 00:06:44,713
What’s that?

95
00:06:49,217 --> 00:06:50,677
Do I have dementia?

96
00:07:05,859 --> 00:07:07,068
Good morning!

97
00:07:07,152 --> 00:07:10,322
I’m Yoon Dan-bi,
I’ll be starting here today.

98
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,324
I look forward to working with you.

99
00:07:14,284 --> 00:07:16,036
What’s with this lukewarm response?

100
00:07:16,036 --> 00:07:17,287
Hello.

101
00:07:17,496 --> 00:07:18,705
Good morning.

102
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:19,915
Yes...

103
00:07:20,916 --> 00:07:23,543
Hee-chul, who’s she?

104
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:26,129
Yoon Dan-bi.

105
00:07:29,257 --> 00:07:31,009
Oh man, that guy...

106
00:07:31,343 --> 00:07:32,385
What?

107
00:07:34,554 --> 00:07:36,473
Sorry, sorry, I’m sorry about that.

108
00:07:39,309 --> 00:07:40,268
Huh?

109
00:07:47,692 --> 00:07:48,944
What in the...

110
00:07:49,069 --> 00:07:50,445
#2 is poking out.

111
00:07:50,445 --> 00:07:51,446
I’ll rewind.

112
00:07:51,446 --> 00:07:53,156
Dang it, you can see #2!

113
00:07:53,657 --> 00:07:57,035
You call this censorship?
You can see it all.

114
00:08:00,831 --> 00:08:02,999
What the heck is this place?

115
00:08:13,802 --> 00:08:15,011
Are you okay?

116
00:08:19,391 --> 00:08:20,976
Are you the new recruit?

117
00:08:22,227 --> 00:08:25,814
I think I’ve come to
the wrong department.

118
00:08:25,814 --> 00:08:26,648
Sorry about that.

119
00:08:26,648 --> 00:08:28,316
No, no, no.

120
00:08:28,316 --> 00:08:30,360
No doubt,
you’re in the right place.

121
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:33,155
Welcome to the Youth Protection Team,
I’m Han, the team leader.

122
00:08:34,531 --> 00:08:35,615
Attention, everyone!

123
00:08:35,907 --> 00:08:38,869
The new recruit we’ve been
waiting for has finally arrived!

124
00:08:39,494 --> 00:08:40,579
One moment.

125
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:42,247
This is the Youth Protection Team?

126
00:08:42,247 --> 00:08:44,708
Yes, the jewel of Korea Communications
Standards Commission,

127
00:08:44,708 --> 00:08:46,793
protecting youth from harmful content.

128
00:08:48,420 --> 00:08:49,379
No way.

129
00:08:49,379 --> 00:08:50,213
I totally get it.

130
00:08:50,213 --> 00:08:53,383
Don’t worry, we rotate positions
every two years, so take your time.

131
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:55,510
So, who’s going to train the rookie?

132
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:58,054
I’ll do it, sir.

133
00:08:58,513 --> 00:08:59,473
Good.

134
00:08:59,890 --> 00:09:02,184
Info and Comms Law Review Guidebook
Go over the highlighted parts,

135
00:09:02,184 --> 00:09:04,978
but I’ll give you a summary
of the key points.

136
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,021
Welcome.

137
00:09:06,438 --> 00:09:10,150
When we receive complaints
about obscene content...

138
00:09:11,485 --> 00:09:12,444
Shit...

139
00:09:12,694 --> 00:09:15,697
It’s okay, if you look at it from
a different perspective, it’s not so bad.

140
00:09:15,697 --> 00:09:19,743
It’s the only reason and goal
humanity has evolved and thrived.

141
00:09:19,743 --> 00:09:20,911
You know, reproduction.

142
00:09:20,911 --> 00:09:21,787
Right...

143
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:25,123
See this site link and video?

144
00:09:25,165 --> 00:09:27,250
Go ahead and skim through it,

145
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,086
then decide under telecom laws,
whether to take it down,

146
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,505
or just block it.

147
00:09:31,505 --> 00:09:34,341
It’s simple, useful,
and easy, right?

148
00:09:36,468 --> 00:09:38,011
Did you see #1 just now?

149
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:40,138
What?

150
00:09:40,305 --> 00:09:42,140
That’s what we call it here.

151
00:09:42,265 --> 00:09:44,810
We use ‘#1’ for male genitalia,
‘#2’ for female genitalia,

152
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,604
and ‘#3’ for pubic hair,
you saw #2 and #3, right?

153
00:09:47,896 --> 00:09:49,189
They were magnified a bit...

154
00:09:50,065 --> 00:09:50,857
Yes...

155
00:09:51,024 --> 00:09:53,568
#1, #2, #3,
no discomfort at all.

156
00:09:53,610 --> 00:09:56,488
It’s the bare minimum of decency.

157
00:10:01,618 --> 00:10:02,619
Shit...

158
00:10:08,166 --> 00:10:09,251
By the way,

159
00:10:10,085 --> 00:10:11,878
are there any women here?

160
00:10:11,878 --> 00:10:13,797
There is, but she stepped out
to get divorced.

161
00:10:14,005 --> 00:10:14,923
Pardon?

162
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:17,008
Did you sign the papers?

163
00:10:17,008 --> 00:10:18,176
I dunno.

164
00:10:19,344 --> 00:10:20,637
Goddamn prick.

165
00:10:21,096 --> 00:10:23,140
He said I can’t have custody
because of this job.

166
00:10:23,223 --> 00:10:25,809
I even said I won’t ask for child support,
but he still refused.

167
00:10:25,809 --> 00:10:27,227
Bad for the kid’s education
or something.

168
00:10:27,394 --> 00:10:30,814
Screwthatdipshitexcuseforahuman,
thatlowlifepieceoftrash.

169
00:10:31,273 --> 00:10:32,357
Who’s this?

170
00:10:32,357 --> 00:10:34,651
Dan-bi, meet our team’s ace.

171
00:10:35,193 --> 00:10:38,071
Hello, I’m Yoon Dan-bi.

172
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,322
I’m Hong Jin-kyung.

173
00:10:39,781 --> 00:10:43,118
She’ll be in charge of monitoring
illegal harmful content.

174
00:10:45,954 --> 00:10:47,956
Wondering why you became
a civil servant for this?

175
00:10:48,206 --> 00:10:48,915
Pardon?

176
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:50,709
No, not at all.

177
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,963
Hee-chul has panic disorder.

178
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:57,716
Du-won goes to a fertility clinic.

179
00:10:57,924 --> 00:11:01,511
They watch 40-50 pornos a day,
it’s a wonder they’re still functioning.

180
00:11:01,845 --> 00:11:03,472
And it’s not just porn.

181
00:11:03,805 --> 00:11:06,892
Amputations, smut, horror...

182
00:11:07,476 --> 00:11:08,852
Jung-seok...

183
00:11:12,022 --> 00:11:13,064
can’t get it up.

184
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:22,032
My dear Dan-bi,

185
00:11:22,199 --> 00:11:25,494
how did it feel watching porn
with a guy you just met?

186
00:11:26,536 --> 00:11:28,246
Any special hiring spots there?

187
00:11:28,246 --> 00:11:29,623
This chick’s perfect for it.

188
00:11:29,623 --> 00:11:31,291
I’m not cut out to be a civil servant.

189
00:11:31,374 --> 00:11:33,460
That’s not the point right now.

190
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:37,798
How am I supposed to write
fairy tales after watching that?

191
00:11:38,215 --> 00:11:40,133
I was finally getting into
a writing flow...

192
00:11:40,133 --> 00:11:42,677
Hey! There’s nothing

193
00:11:43,386 --> 00:11:45,472
that gets you in the groove
like porn.

194
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:48,128
Yeah, she’s got a point.

195
00:11:50,101 --> 00:11:51,520
Should I just quit?

196
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:54,564
Are you nuts? For what?

197
00:11:54,773 --> 00:11:56,525
Humans are creatures of adaptation.

198
00:11:56,525 --> 00:11:59,402
Yeah, you worked so hard
to get in, stick it out a bit.

199
00:11:59,736 --> 00:12:03,365
There’s a chick here who has been
waiting years for a contract renewal.

200
00:12:03,532 --> 00:12:05,033
I’ll whip you!

201
00:12:05,617 --> 00:12:07,327
I was promised a permanent spot.

202
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,370
Sure, sure, sure.

203
00:12:08,912 --> 00:12:10,372
Alright, two years...

204
00:12:11,081 --> 00:12:12,165
It’ll go by fast, right?

205
00:12:12,207 --> 00:12:13,333
I’m telling you, it will!

206
00:12:13,333 --> 00:12:15,669
Yeah, it’ll fly by,
raise your glasses!

207
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:16,461
Cheers!

208
00:12:16,545 --> 00:12:17,921
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

209
00:12:19,214 --> 00:12:20,590
What do I tell Ha-neul?

210
00:12:20,632 --> 00:12:22,926
- Ha-neul?
- The kid’s book publisher.

211
00:12:26,972 --> 00:12:28,682
This is amazing, what’s it called?

212
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,393
ORGASM!

213
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:33,854
Stop teasing me!

214
00:12:44,447 --> 00:12:45,699
What’s up with her?

215
00:12:47,576 --> 00:12:49,870
Do they all look naked to you?

216
00:12:50,537 --> 00:12:51,580
Uh-huh...

217
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:53,373
Even me?

218
00:12:59,713 --> 00:13:00,839
She went full crazy.

219
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:02,549
Children’s Literature Contest

220
00:13:02,674 --> 00:13:05,260
Get off work at 6, eat by 8.

221
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:07,846
If I write for four hours every day...

222
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:10,432
8pm - 12am: Write fairy tales!

223
00:13:10,557 --> 00:13:12,434
I just have to debut...

224
00:13:14,644 --> 00:13:17,397
No, write one more hour.

225
00:13:23,028 --> 00:13:25,197
Dan-bi, you’ve got this.

226
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:30,285
Boss, a package came for you.

227
00:13:30,285 --> 00:13:31,661
- Package?
- Yes.

228
00:13:31,745 --> 00:13:32,996
Oh, my baby...

229
00:13:35,749 --> 00:13:38,919
A 1986 Porsche Carrera,

230
00:13:38,919 --> 00:13:41,379
OEM side mirror...

231
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,839
Incredible, isn’t it?

232
00:13:43,381 --> 00:13:44,174
It sure is shiny.

233
00:13:44,257 --> 00:13:46,551
Boss, now’s really
not the time for this.

234
00:13:46,551 --> 00:13:49,095
Ms. Jin got snatched up by EroKing.

235
00:13:49,221 --> 00:13:53,642
EroKing? That guy used to
work under me.

236
00:13:53,725 --> 00:13:54,684
He’s a hottie, though.

237
00:13:54,810 --> 00:13:57,145
It’s not just that,
he’s at the top of the industry,

238
00:13:57,145 --> 00:13:59,147
in just in three years,
he even got investors.

239
00:13:59,439 --> 00:14:04,069
Why’d anyone invest in
a trashy writer like him?

240
00:14:04,069 --> 00:14:05,737
What a stupid nickname.

241
00:14:05,737 --> 00:14:08,657
He’s the #1 ranked writer,
backed by investors.

242
00:14:12,619 --> 00:14:13,537
All done.

243
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:14,704
Hands off!

244
00:14:14,955 --> 00:14:17,040
Sir, are you really okay?

245
00:14:17,165 --> 00:14:19,709
Don’t worry about it, okay?

246
00:14:19,835 --> 00:14:24,464
We’ve got our secret weapon,
Ms. Oh’s ‘Lady in the Rain.’

247
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:26,424
It’s blowing up right now!

248
00:14:26,424 --> 00:14:29,553
What’s its rank this week?
Definitely in the top 10, right?

249
00:14:30,095 --> 00:14:30,887
Hm?

250
00:14:31,263 --> 00:14:33,974
‘Lady in the Rain’ just got
a warning from the KCSC.

251
00:14:35,559 --> 00:14:36,518
Come on...

252
00:14:36,601 --> 00:14:38,645
Looks like some civic group
filed another complaint.

253
00:14:39,855 --> 00:14:41,481
How many times is this now?

254
00:14:41,481 --> 00:14:42,899
Fourth time, fourth time...

255
00:14:43,024 --> 00:14:43,650
Damn...

256
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:46,236
If we change the sex scene
to indoor--

257
00:14:46,236 --> 00:14:49,072
What? Indoors?
In this economy?

258
00:14:49,072 --> 00:14:52,492
Broke ass impatient folks don’t have
sex indoors! They do it outside!

259
00:14:52,492 --> 00:14:53,994
Am I right? Say it!

260
00:14:56,538 --> 00:15:00,250
I’ve been very patient with them
all this time, yeah?

261
00:15:01,042 --> 00:15:02,085
Shit...

262
00:15:03,086 --> 00:15:04,337
Boss!

263
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:05,005
Shut up!

264
00:15:05,005 --> 00:15:07,424
Guarantee freedom of expression!

265
00:15:07,466 --> 00:15:09,384
Guarantee Freedom of
Expression for Erotica!

266
00:15:09,384 --> 00:15:10,886
Free expression for erotica!

267
00:15:10,886 --> 00:15:13,054
Thank you! Thank you!

268
00:15:13,054 --> 00:15:14,764
Please show your support!

269
00:15:14,764 --> 00:15:18,643
Guarantee it, dammit!
Guarantee it!

270
00:15:18,685 --> 00:15:20,604
Guarantee freedom of expression!

271
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:21,855
Thank you!

272
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:24,900
Guarantee freedom of expression!

273
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:28,195
No!

274
00:15:29,029 --> 00:15:30,155
No!

275
00:15:30,405 --> 00:15:31,406
Move!

276
00:15:41,792 --> 00:15:43,668
I’m okay...

277
00:15:46,087 --> 00:15:47,589
My baby...

278
00:15:52,719 --> 00:15:57,390
Porsche 911 Carrera,
air-cooled...

279
00:15:58,850 --> 00:16:01,144
My baby!

280
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:07,234
Excuse me...

281
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:12,322
How much will it cost?
It looks really old...

282
00:16:12,614 --> 00:16:14,825
It’s a rare classic, so...

283
00:16:14,825 --> 00:16:17,160
with the panel work,
paint, and the side mirror,

284
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:19,287
it’ll be about $100,000
with OEM parts.

285
00:16:19,412 --> 00:16:20,372
What?!

286
00:16:21,123 --> 00:16:22,791
$100,000?

287
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:24,334
Yes, around there.

288
00:16:26,044 --> 00:16:28,964
Come on, you’re pulling my leg,
how can it cost $100,000?

289
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:30,048
Excuse me!

290
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:32,592
This is a 1986 model,

291
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:34,553
Porsche 911!

292
00:16:34,719 --> 00:16:37,514
It’s been discontinued,
you can’t find parts in Korea!

293
00:16:37,514 --> 00:16:39,141
I have to import everything!

294
00:16:39,641 --> 00:16:40,934
No insurance?

295
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,521
I ride a bike,
what insurance could I have?

296
00:16:48,358 --> 00:16:49,359
Crap...

297
00:16:58,618 --> 00:16:59,995
Don’t touch!

298
00:17:00,537 --> 00:17:01,746
No touching!

299
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:07,252
Why are these beat-up cars
so expensive?!

300
00:17:09,504 --> 00:17:10,547
Crap!

301
00:17:12,132 --> 00:17:13,550
Has it already started?

302
00:17:13,550 --> 00:17:15,051
It’s earlier than expected.

303
00:17:15,510 --> 00:17:17,179
Did you really think
she’d be like us?

304
00:17:17,304 --> 00:17:18,930
The Millennials are built differently.

305
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:21,433
We should ease her in gently.

306
00:17:26,938 --> 00:17:30,025
Youth Protection Team ‘Yoon’
Boss, we’re losing
all our writers to EroKing,

307
00:17:30,025 --> 00:17:32,027
Korea Communications Standards Commission
and Ms. Oh is the only one left.

308
00:17:32,027 --> 00:17:33,987
This isn’t the time to be laughing...

309
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:40,610
Are you okay?

310
00:17:42,704 --> 00:17:43,955
Where am I?

311
00:17:44,956 --> 00:17:46,833
Uh, I...

312
00:17:47,292 --> 00:17:48,376
Who...

313
00:17:49,503 --> 00:17:51,963
How are you feeling?

314
00:17:52,172 --> 00:17:54,966
Right, I had an accident.

315
00:17:55,425 --> 00:17:59,888
This is why the day after
a car accident is so crucial.

316
00:18:00,764 --> 00:18:03,266
My mouth feels so dry,
I can’t even eat porridge.

317
00:18:03,308 --> 00:18:06,061
This must be what
chewing on sand is like.

318
00:18:06,186 --> 00:18:08,480
Oh dear, you haven’t
eaten anything?

319
00:18:08,647 --> 00:18:10,315
Boss, I brought you some pork feet.

320
00:18:10,315 --> 00:18:12,984
The Golden Pork Feet
you mentioned are all sold out.

321
00:18:16,947 --> 00:18:17,948
I see...

322
00:18:18,532 --> 00:18:21,284
My baby Porsche 911 is gone too...

323
00:18:21,451 --> 00:18:22,410
What’s the point of living?

324
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:25,497
I should just eat the pork feet,
choke on a bone and end it all.

325
00:18:25,580 --> 00:18:28,708
That car was so beautiful.

326
00:18:28,875 --> 00:18:32,003
It was so elegant,
and if you trust me with it,

327
00:18:32,129 --> 00:18:33,380
I’ll make it look as similar as--

328
00:18:33,380 --> 00:18:35,507
Not from the official garage,
but on your own?

329
00:18:35,507 --> 00:18:37,717
Where would a civil servant
even get the money?

330
00:18:37,717 --> 00:18:38,593
Exactly!

331
00:18:39,302 --> 00:18:42,764
Well, if you really don’t have
any money,

332
00:18:42,973 --> 00:18:45,475
then maybe you should
repay me in another way.

333
00:18:46,518 --> 00:18:47,269
In another way?

334
00:18:47,269 --> 00:18:51,273
I saw on your business card,
you work at KCSC

335
00:18:51,398 --> 00:18:56,153
in the Youth Protection Team,
so, what could you do for me?

336
00:18:56,486 --> 00:18:58,655
Come on, no way!

337
00:18:58,655 --> 00:18:59,698
Yeah, yes way.

338
00:18:59,698 --> 00:19:03,952
Our works keep getting complaints,
it’s driving me crazy.

339
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:06,413
Can’t you, you know,
handle things and clear it up?

340
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:07,956
Okay?

341
00:19:07,956 --> 00:19:09,416
But that’s...

342
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:11,626
that’s illegal.

343
00:19:11,626 --> 00:19:13,211
You definitely shouldn’t do that.

344
00:19:13,211 --> 00:19:15,046
Yo, Specs, did you
contact my lawyer?

345
00:19:15,046 --> 00:19:16,047
One moment!

346
00:19:17,174 --> 00:19:19,801
So, what if... I pay you
in installments?

347
00:19:19,843 --> 00:19:20,844
30...

348
00:19:21,052 --> 00:19:22,262
years or so?

349
00:19:22,345 --> 00:19:24,097
I’ll be dead by then.

350
00:19:24,097 --> 00:19:25,682
Or I can proofread for you.

351
00:19:25,682 --> 00:19:28,477
I actually majored creative writing.

352
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:29,978
Is that so?

353
00:19:30,937 --> 00:19:31,938
No, wait.

354
00:19:32,230 --> 00:19:33,982
Am I crazy to work on
porn stories and crap?

355
00:19:34,232 --> 00:19:35,859
“Porn stories and crap”?!

356
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:38,361
What I mean is,

357
00:19:38,403 --> 00:19:41,364
there are so many proper writings
in the world, why that stuff...

358
00:19:41,781 --> 00:19:42,949
“That stuff”?!

359
00:19:43,742 --> 00:19:48,205
Why don’t you use
this opportunity to write

360
00:19:49,247 --> 00:19:50,290
more respectable stories?

361
00:19:50,290 --> 00:19:53,835
So, you’re saying the stuff
we put out isn’t respectable,

362
00:19:53,835 --> 00:19:55,629
and it’s something shameful?

363
00:19:55,629 --> 00:19:56,713
That’s right.

364
00:19:57,005 --> 00:19:59,966
Those trashy porn stories,
just having them around--

365
00:19:59,966 --> 00:20:01,760
I think the boss needs his rest.

366
00:20:01,843 --> 00:20:03,386
The visiting hours are almost over...

367
00:20:03,428 --> 00:20:04,387
Wait, there are visiting hours?

368
00:20:04,387 --> 00:20:05,263
Yes, there is now.

369
00:20:05,263 --> 00:20:06,264
Wait a minute!

370
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:07,682
Did you hear that?

371
00:20:08,517 --> 00:20:09,684
She called it trash!

372
00:20:13,438 --> 00:20:14,689
Jesus Christ...

373
00:20:16,066 --> 00:20:17,317
Let’s eat pork feet.

374
00:20:18,819 --> 00:20:19,653
So close...

375
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,696
Erotica does really well these days.

376
00:20:21,696 --> 00:20:23,114
Even my teachers read it.

377
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:24,866
What’s with you too?

378
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,160
Is adult romance illegal?

379
00:20:27,536 --> 00:20:28,495
No, it’s not.

380
00:20:28,662 --> 00:20:30,664
Or do you have $100,000?

381
00:20:31,414 --> 00:20:32,749
Does it look like I do?

382
00:20:33,583 --> 00:20:35,293
Then what will you do?

383
00:20:36,294 --> 00:20:37,337
You know the answer.

384
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:38,880
Seriously!

385
00:20:38,964 --> 00:20:43,135
20 stories for $100,000,
maybe I should take up writing too.

386
00:20:43,135 --> 00:20:45,554
Things are so easy
when it’s not your problem, huh?

387
00:20:45,846 --> 00:20:49,099
How could I write something
I’ve never written before?

388
00:20:49,224 --> 00:20:50,725
Then copy and paste.

389
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:54,312
You’ve got plenty of references
at your fingertips.

390
00:20:54,437 --> 00:20:55,355
Comes with the job.

391
00:20:55,355 --> 00:20:56,356
Forget it.

392
00:20:57,232 --> 00:20:58,942
I’ve got my pride as a writer.

393
00:20:58,942 --> 00:21:00,152
So high and almighty.

394
00:21:05,365 --> 00:21:07,200
Don’t change your mind later.

395
00:21:07,784 --> 00:21:09,161
Put it over there.

396
00:21:13,290 --> 00:21:14,458
You can go now.

397
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:21,256
Are you serious about this?

398
00:21:22,674 --> 00:21:25,427
Serious? Like hell I am.

399
00:21:25,635 --> 00:21:28,972
You think she can write 20 stories?

400
00:21:29,097 --> 00:21:31,183
Does she think we’re fools?

401
00:21:31,349 --> 00:21:33,560
Just wait and see,

402
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:38,064
she’ll come back crying,
begging to do whatever I ask.

403
00:21:38,356 --> 00:21:39,983
Her lips

404
00:21:41,151 --> 00:21:43,028
Her chest

405
00:21:45,322 --> 00:21:46,198
Her breasts

406
00:21:46,281 --> 00:21:47,783
Her panties

407
00:21:52,496 --> 00:21:55,999
Yeah, pride doesn’t pay the bills.

408
00:22:00,045 --> 00:22:03,673
A love story with sex in it.

409
00:22:07,385 --> 00:22:12,098
Sex is biological gender,
and in this context, gender refers...

410
00:22:14,059 --> 00:22:16,269
Write me a story, you fool!

411
00:22:16,645 --> 00:22:17,979
A story!

412
00:22:19,564 --> 00:22:21,024
Should I not use the word “sex”?

413
00:22:21,358 --> 00:22:25,111
A love story through sexual relations.

414
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:29,616
Natural reproductive methods,
mainly involving humans, while insects

415
00:22:29,616 --> 00:22:32,327
and animals use the term “mating.”

416
00:22:32,327 --> 00:22:33,787
Between sexes...

417
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:37,791
Undressing, breast fondling, cunnilingus?

418
00:22:40,335 --> 00:22:41,670
“Cunnilingus”...

419
00:22:43,088 --> 00:22:46,466
A man or woman uses
their mouth on female genitals...

420
00:22:47,175 --> 00:22:47,717
The Big O.

421
00:22:47,717 --> 00:22:49,970
A script that sounds like porn.

422
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,930
Sorry, I can’t assist with that request.

423
00:22:52,013 --> 00:22:56,977
The world’s most erotic anecdote.

424
00:22:58,228 --> 00:22:59,187
A true story.

425
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:01,648
Just write a story, please!

426
00:23:01,815 --> 00:23:04,109
Goddammit!

427
00:23:12,325 --> 00:23:13,285
Secret Temptation in the Classroom

428
00:23:24,504 --> 00:23:26,548
Just from her back,
I can tell she’s gonna quit.

429
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:30,844
She’s like me
before my panic attack.

430
00:23:33,346 --> 00:23:36,933
Nope, I bet my paycheck
she’ll stick it out.

431
00:23:37,267 --> 00:23:39,811
How many times already?

432
00:23:39,895 --> 00:23:41,980
Poor Jung-seok...

433
00:23:44,983 --> 00:23:46,985
#delicioussushi #wannaeateveryday

434
00:23:47,819 --> 00:23:51,698
I’ll feed her what she wants, okay!

435
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:18,475
Erotica

436
00:24:19,476 --> 00:24:21,186
They’re all the same anyway...

437
00:24:21,978 --> 00:24:23,772
I’ll just piece them together.

438
00:24:24,856 --> 00:24:27,234
You know leaking material
is prohibited, right?

439
00:24:27,484 --> 00:24:29,402
It’s not leaking, it’s ref...

440
00:24:31,988 --> 00:24:33,406
You scared me!

441
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,826
You scared me more!

442
00:24:36,535 --> 00:24:37,536
$100,000?!

443
00:24:38,328 --> 00:24:39,162
Yes.

444
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:41,748
Can’t you just let it go this once?

445
00:24:42,290 --> 00:24:45,585
Even so, do you realize
what you’ve done?

446
00:24:45,752 --> 00:24:47,963
I know, I’m sorry!

447
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:50,715
Please let this slide
just this once.

448
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:52,592
I feel bad for you...

449
00:24:54,219 --> 00:24:57,430
Still, this is not right.

450
00:24:57,430 --> 00:24:58,640
Sir!

451
00:24:59,850 --> 00:25:01,351
Please, save me.

452
00:25:02,644 --> 00:25:06,231
If you let this slide,
I’ll do anything you ask.

453
00:25:06,356 --> 00:25:08,358
Anything, please?

454
00:25:13,113 --> 00:25:14,322
Three months.

455
00:25:15,490 --> 00:25:17,742
I’ll be watching you
for the next three months.

456
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:22,122
You can’t quit for at least
three months, got it?

457
00:25:22,122 --> 00:25:22,956
Okay.

458
00:25:25,167 --> 00:25:28,295
But, why three months?

459
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:35,385
If you don’t want to,
we can still call it off.

460
00:25:35,635 --> 00:25:36,887
Wait a minute.

461
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:39,806
I’ll do it! Who said I didn’t want to?

462
00:25:43,185 --> 00:25:46,021
Let’s do our best.

463
00:26:15,300 --> 00:26:17,260
Erotica

464
00:26:35,153 --> 00:26:36,238
Daddy…

465
00:26:39,533 --> 00:26:42,702
She’s definitely fishing.

466
00:26:43,745 --> 00:26:47,374
Who knows who might get turned on?

467
00:26:48,416 --> 00:26:50,460
A shaman’s thick, hot pe...

468
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,753
hot penis

469
00:26:54,381 --> 00:26:57,259
We use #1 for male genitalia,
#2 for female genitalia,

470
00:26:57,384 --> 00:26:59,136
and #3 for pubic hair...

471
00:27:00,804 --> 00:27:02,931
Find: penis
Replace: #1

472
00:27:05,517 --> 00:27:10,897
Mu-young grabbed #1
and slowly inserted it

473
00:27:11,064 --> 00:27:13,692
into #2 beneath her skirt.

474
00:27:14,860 --> 00:27:15,944
Whoa!

475
00:27:19,281 --> 00:27:22,242
You must be busy.
How’s the book coming along?

476
00:27:25,996 --> 00:27:28,373
Good, can’t wait to show you

477
00:27:28,373 --> 00:27:29,708
What am I doing right now?

478
00:27:29,708 --> 00:27:31,251
Just copy it all.

479
00:27:32,377 --> 00:27:34,004
Everything.

480
00:28:10,081 --> 00:28:13,543
Even cutting and pasting
is exhausting...

481
00:28:17,631 --> 00:28:21,635
Wake up, Thoma-Thoma,
a bright morning has come!

482
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:25,972
Be strong, Thoma-Thoma,
chase your dream!

483
00:28:26,181 --> 00:28:30,101
If something bothers you,
look up and scream!

484
00:28:31,269 --> 00:28:33,855
Hey, what are you all doing?

485
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:35,899
Stay away from each other!
Stand up straight!

486
00:28:35,899 --> 00:28:37,609
Straighten your legs!

487
00:28:39,528 --> 00:28:40,529
Christ...

488
00:28:41,446 --> 00:28:43,323
What? Plagiarism?

489
00:28:45,367 --> 00:28:49,454
Plagiarism? There’s no
such thing in erotica!

490
00:28:50,122 --> 00:28:53,708
Why wouldn’t there be?
Title, ‘The Moaning.’

491
00:28:53,875 --> 00:28:56,461
‘She’s definitely fishing.’

492
00:28:56,586 --> 00:28:58,171
‘Who knows who might
get turned on?’

493
00:28:58,171 --> 00:29:00,507
Didn’t you take that
from the film ‘The Wailing’?

494
00:29:00,674 --> 00:29:03,135
Right? Feeling guilty?

495
00:29:04,094 --> 00:29:05,303
Damn you...

496
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:08,598
And it wasn’t just
one or two works, either.

497
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,475
‘The Silence of the Wife’!

498
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,811
‘Guardians of the Erection’,
‘Mission: Impossible Position!

499
00:29:12,811 --> 00:29:14,646
Are you kidding me?

500
00:29:14,729 --> 00:29:16,857
What’s the deal with #1 and #2?

501
00:29:17,023 --> 00:29:20,110
I was supposed to replace those.

502
00:29:20,318 --> 00:29:23,864
Honestly, all erotica is the same,
who cares about plagiarism?

503
00:29:23,864 --> 00:29:25,532
They’re all pervs--

504
00:29:26,074 --> 00:29:30,162
I mean, don’t they all want
pretty the same thing?

505
00:29:30,787 --> 00:29:31,538
That thing?

506
00:29:31,538 --> 00:29:32,289
“That thing”?

507
00:29:32,414 --> 00:29:34,166
Then why read erotica?

508
00:29:34,166 --> 00:29:36,376
They might as well just watch porn!

509
00:29:36,460 --> 00:29:38,753
This is still literature, after all!

510
00:29:38,962 --> 00:29:40,255
Adult literature!

511
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:44,050
I didn’t expect much
from the start, to be honest.

512
00:29:44,050 --> 00:29:46,011
But damn, plagiarism too?

513
00:29:46,011 --> 00:29:48,555
And you still call yourself a writer?

514
00:29:49,097 --> 00:29:50,182
Aren’t you ashamed?

515
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:01,067
Ms. Yoon!

516
00:30:01,276 --> 00:30:02,569
Hello!

517
00:30:03,528 --> 00:30:04,696
Who...

518
00:30:06,406 --> 00:30:09,618
I’m Oh Ga-ram, we met last time
at Mr. Hwang’s hospital.

519
00:30:10,243 --> 00:30:11,703
Oh, hello.

520
00:30:11,787 --> 00:30:12,996
Good evening.

521
00:30:15,791 --> 00:30:18,126
I love stories about love.

522
00:30:18,794 --> 00:30:20,837
That’s why I enjoy
adult romance stories.

523
00:30:21,213 --> 00:30:24,299
They include courtship,
jealousy, and thrill...

524
00:30:24,925 --> 00:30:26,802
It’s part of human nature.

525
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:30,305
Stories... about love.

526
00:30:31,556 --> 00:30:33,767
You’ll do great.

527
00:30:37,103 --> 00:30:39,648
Can I see what you’ve written?

528
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:40,816
Huh?

529
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:42,526
This!

530
00:30:42,984 --> 00:30:44,611
You know about these?

531
00:30:45,237 --> 00:30:46,238
Dreams and...

532
00:30:47,072 --> 00:30:48,240
Hope...

533
00:30:48,281 --> 00:30:49,407
- Thoma-Thoma!
- Thoma-Thoma!

534
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:53,495
How do you know this?
Almost no one knows about it.

535
00:30:53,495 --> 00:30:55,455
That’s so amazing!

536
00:30:55,455 --> 00:30:59,459
I’ve read ‘The Adventures of Thomas’,
and all of this writer’s series.

537
00:31:00,001 --> 00:31:03,296
I decided to become a writer
thanks to him!

538
00:31:03,296 --> 00:31:04,673
- Really?
- Yeah.

539
00:31:12,639 --> 00:31:14,224
That’s really touching.

540
00:31:14,224 --> 00:31:17,602
A fairy tale-like thing
happens to a fairy tale writer.

541
00:31:17,602 --> 00:31:18,478
I know.

542
00:31:18,937 --> 00:31:22,899
Isn’t it surreal that someone
still remembers Thomas?

543
00:31:23,275 --> 00:31:24,067
Sure.

544
00:31:24,067 --> 00:31:25,652
It’s so beautiful, it brings tears.

545
00:31:26,236 --> 00:31:30,323
That’s why I’m determined
to succeed as a fairy tale writer.

546
00:31:30,615 --> 00:31:31,825
Super fired up.

547
00:31:31,825 --> 00:31:33,743
And the erotica? Is it done?

548
00:31:38,415 --> 00:31:42,169
This is intense,
but there’s no buildup.

549
00:31:43,128 --> 00:31:45,964
Even for a copy-paste job,
this lacks effort.

550
00:31:45,964 --> 00:31:48,216
They instantly go at it
like animals?

551
00:31:48,884 --> 00:31:50,677
You fucked someone
as soon as you met him once.

552
00:31:50,677 --> 00:31:52,679
It was justified at the time.

553
00:31:54,097 --> 00:31:56,183
The vibe, the emotion,

554
00:31:56,641 --> 00:31:58,059
you gals wouldn’t understand.

555
00:31:58,935 --> 00:32:00,896
Just write her stories.

556
00:32:01,021 --> 00:32:03,565
She’s probably been with
at least 100 guys...

557
00:32:04,608 --> 00:32:06,193
Over 100?

558
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:08,612
Definitely not 100.

559
00:32:10,238 --> 00:32:11,156
Maybe?

560
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:12,407
Hey,

561
00:32:12,574 --> 00:32:14,951
since we’re at it,
give her some freebies.

562
00:32:18,622 --> 00:32:19,915
You’re the best.

563
00:32:21,666 --> 00:32:23,126
What do you need?

564
00:32:24,252 --> 00:32:30,926
You know, the most memorable...
that thing in your life.

565
00:32:32,594 --> 00:32:33,637
Sex.

566
00:32:34,304 --> 00:32:35,138
Yes.

567
00:32:44,481 --> 00:32:48,443
I think I was a college freshman...

568
00:32:56,326 --> 00:32:59,788
The competition is coming up soon,
so be careful not to get hurt.

569
00:33:31,027 --> 00:33:32,070
Chae-young.

570
00:33:32,404 --> 00:33:33,405
Why did you come?

571
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:34,614
Here you go, great job.

572
00:33:34,614 --> 00:33:35,490
Thanks.

573
00:33:35,574 --> 00:33:37,367
- Tired?
- Not really.

574
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:38,452
You should rest in the shade.

575
00:33:38,452 --> 00:33:39,411
It’s okay.

576
00:33:40,787 --> 00:33:42,539
Good job, take a break with others.

577
00:33:48,587 --> 00:33:49,963
Come on, that’s enough!

578
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:52,132
Wait a minute! Sorry!

579
00:33:54,009 --> 00:33:55,093
Chae-young, are you alright?

580
00:33:55,093 --> 00:33:56,511
Yeah, I’m fine.

581
00:33:56,636 --> 00:33:57,804
Hey, don’t get shoved around.

582
00:34:06,438 --> 00:34:08,523
Hey, this is too much!

583
00:34:09,774 --> 00:34:10,775
Sorry...

584
00:34:23,205 --> 00:34:24,372
Crap...

585
00:34:30,962 --> 00:34:32,130
‘Angry 12 Inch’?

586
00:34:32,155 --> 00:34:32,948
Shit!

587
00:34:34,508 --> 00:34:35,509
‘Shit’?

588
00:34:35,592 --> 00:34:36,551
I’m sorry...

589
00:34:37,219 --> 00:34:40,055
The reference is full of profanity.

590
00:34:40,180 --> 00:34:42,808
You startled me.

591
00:34:43,183 --> 00:34:45,519
But why does everyone swear
during the climax?

592
00:34:45,602 --> 00:34:48,146
Because it feels good, I guess?

593
00:34:48,271 --> 00:34:50,315
If it feels good, why curse?

594
00:34:51,483 --> 00:34:53,401
Do you do that as well?

595
00:34:57,030 --> 00:34:57,906
Well...

596
00:34:58,281 --> 00:35:01,118
I hear only beginners do that.

597
00:35:01,118 --> 00:35:03,829
I’m usually on the receiving end.

598
00:35:05,997 --> 00:35:07,040
So, you’re experienced.

599
00:35:07,207 --> 00:35:08,750
Come on now...

600
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:11,211
Then, as an expert,

601
00:35:11,253 --> 00:35:14,089
Could you take a look
at my writing?

602
00:35:16,133 --> 00:35:16,758
Please...

603
00:35:16,758 --> 00:35:18,385
- I have to go...
- Just once...

604
00:35:20,011 --> 00:35:20,804
Hm?

605
00:35:21,972 --> 00:35:23,223
I’m getting off.

606
00:35:27,519 --> 00:35:29,271
- You okay?
- Yeah.

607
00:36:05,932 --> 00:36:07,392
- How is it?
- What?

608
00:36:08,685 --> 00:36:09,769
Is it solid?

609
00:36:09,936 --> 00:36:11,730
What? What is?

610
00:36:11,730 --> 00:36:13,815
The story, is it solid?

611
00:36:14,608 --> 00:36:17,611
Right, story...

612
00:36:18,778 --> 00:36:19,821
I think it’s okay now.

613
00:36:19,863 --> 00:36:22,991
By the way,
you used #1, #2, and #3...

614
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:26,870
It was the bare minimum of decency.

615
00:36:31,416 --> 00:36:34,961
The story... is really interesting.

616
00:36:36,004 --> 00:36:37,130
Thank you.

617
00:36:38,256 --> 00:36:39,299
For what?

618
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:41,676
It worked...

619
00:36:41,927 --> 00:36:42,928
Pardon?

620
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:43,887
What?

621
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:46,056
You said something...

622
00:36:48,934 --> 00:36:50,685
I meant, the story works...

623
00:36:50,685 --> 00:36:54,397
I got drunk in your words,
which means, it worked...

624
00:36:54,773 --> 00:36:58,485
Soju, it’s like a craving for soju
at the bar next door.

625
00:36:58,485 --> 00:37:00,237
Is that so?

626
00:37:00,362 --> 00:37:04,616
Since you helped me,
I’ll treat you soju.

627
00:37:04,783 --> 00:37:07,911
Since you’re craving soju
because of me, so it’s on me.

628
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:11,164
You don’t have to go that far...

629
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:12,666
Aren’t you coming?

630
00:37:12,707 --> 00:37:15,085
Ah, screw it, whatever.

631
00:37:26,721 --> 00:37:28,306
Aren’t you Ms. Oh Ga-ram?

632
00:37:28,431 --> 00:37:29,141
What?

633
00:37:29,307 --> 00:37:32,144
Hello, I’m the CEO of EroKing Corp.,

634
00:37:32,435 --> 00:37:33,937
EroKing.

635
00:37:35,814 --> 00:37:37,232
- Cheers!
- Cheers.

636
00:37:40,861 --> 00:37:42,612
Dan-bi, you should take it easy.

637
00:37:43,113 --> 00:37:45,115
It looks like you’ve
already had a lot.

638
00:37:47,451 --> 00:37:49,786
It’s just that my insides...

639
00:37:50,370 --> 00:37:52,873
are completely burned out.

640
00:37:53,039 --> 00:37:55,459
Because of $100,000?

641
00:37:55,834 --> 00:37:57,794
Someone once told me,

642
00:37:58,003 --> 00:38:02,257
that erotica and fairy tales
aren’t so different.

643
00:38:03,467 --> 00:38:05,010
Do you think so too?

644
00:38:08,013 --> 00:38:09,222
I’m not sure.

645
00:38:10,599 --> 00:38:13,226
But I found it quite enjoyable.

646
00:38:13,810 --> 00:38:15,562
Isn’t that good enough?

647
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:21,568
But in racing gear,

648
00:38:22,027 --> 00:38:24,362
can you actually make it stand?

649
00:38:25,739 --> 00:38:27,324
It’s super tight spandex, though.

650
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:30,869
Why not? It’s fully up!

651
00:38:32,537 --> 00:38:34,372
No way, that’s impossible.

652
00:38:34,498 --> 00:38:35,791
Why is that so impossible?

653
00:38:35,791 --> 00:38:37,667
It’s fully erect!

654
00:38:38,376 --> 00:38:39,503
Don’t listen to that.

655
00:38:39,503 --> 00:38:40,128
There are kids here.

656
00:38:40,128 --> 00:38:41,880
Don’t you know what that is?

657
00:38:41,880 --> 00:38:42,672
Super hard erection.

658
00:38:42,672 --> 00:38:43,840
What’s “erection”?

659
00:38:43,840 --> 00:38:45,383
You’ll understand when you’re older.

660
00:38:45,592 --> 00:38:46,551
Super hard erection!

661
00:38:46,635 --> 00:38:47,594
What is she even saying?

662
00:38:47,677 --> 00:38:48,470
Dan-bi!

663
00:38:48,470 --> 00:38:52,766
A real full erection can even make
this bottle stand up!

664
00:38:52,766 --> 00:38:54,684
If not, it’s flaccid!

665
00:38:55,018 --> 00:38:56,061
Dan-bi, I’m going home!

666
00:38:56,061 --> 00:38:56,686
Super hard erection!

667
00:38:56,686 --> 00:38:58,438
You stay here,
I have to go!

668
00:38:58,688 --> 00:39:00,607
Keep the change,
thank you!

669
00:39:00,607 --> 00:39:01,316
Super hard erection!

670
00:39:01,316 --> 00:39:02,526
Get home safely, I had fun.

671
00:39:02,526 --> 00:39:03,693
Super hard erection!

672
00:39:03,860 --> 00:39:05,445
Super hard erection! Erection!

673
00:39:10,742 --> 00:39:12,077
That feels refreshing.

674
00:39:21,169 --> 00:39:25,006
A real full erection can
even raise this glass bottle!

675
00:39:25,173 --> 00:39:27,384
If not, it’s flaccid!

676
00:39:30,428 --> 00:39:31,847
Come on...

677
00:39:35,016 --> 00:39:36,560
Ridiculous.

678
00:39:48,864 --> 00:39:49,739
Okay!

679
00:40:40,582 --> 00:40:41,625
Bebe!

680
00:40:58,767 --> 00:40:59,726
No!

681
00:41:04,105 --> 00:41:05,690
Elevator
Climaxing in an elevator?

682
00:41:05,816 --> 00:41:07,567
How childish.

683
00:41:08,026 --> 00:41:10,987
Hey, can that really happen?

684
00:41:12,656 --> 00:41:14,407
What about you?

685
00:41:14,574 --> 00:41:15,700
It worked for me.

686
00:41:15,909 --> 00:41:16,868
Yeah?

687
00:41:18,745 --> 00:41:20,163
That actually works?

688
00:41:20,163 --> 00:41:21,832
Should we turn it down again?

689
00:41:21,873 --> 00:41:22,916
Don’t.

690
00:41:23,125 --> 00:41:25,377
We haven’t seen Oh
for a few days now.

691
00:41:25,627 --> 00:41:26,920
Did something happen?

692
00:41:27,045 --> 00:41:29,548
Hey, quick, give her a call!

693
00:41:30,215 --> 00:41:32,342
She’s suddenly unreachable?

694
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:37,889
Sir, I should really be
telling you this in person,

695
00:41:37,889 --> 00:41:39,683
but I’m too ashamed to do that...

696
00:41:39,808 --> 00:41:44,479
I’ll never forget everything you taught me
despite my shortcomings.

697
00:41:44,521 --> 00:41:47,023
She deposited contract
cancellation penalty.

698
00:41:48,775 --> 00:41:50,735
That bastard strikes again!

699
00:41:54,948 --> 00:41:56,491
Geezer

700
00:41:57,159 --> 00:41:58,410
Moron.

701
00:42:01,997 --> 00:42:02,998
Welcome.

702
00:42:03,123 --> 00:42:03,957
Hi.

703
00:42:04,082 --> 00:42:07,002
Despite employing
such an excellent writer,

704
00:42:07,085 --> 00:42:09,629
Mr. Hwang treated you so poorly,
making you so thin,

705
00:42:09,629 --> 00:42:12,257
he’s too much, don’t you think?

706
00:42:13,133 --> 00:42:16,636
This is made with beans,
please try it.

707
00:42:24,311 --> 00:42:25,520
It’s so delicious.

708
00:42:25,729 --> 00:42:30,192
Amazing things will happen
in your life from now on.

709
00:42:32,861 --> 00:42:37,240
Why are you in bad terms
with Mr. Hwang?

710
00:42:37,365 --> 00:42:40,202
I heard you originally trained
for your debut under him.

711
00:42:41,328 --> 00:42:44,080
We had some differing
views on erotica.

712
00:42:44,164 --> 00:42:46,917
Erotica should awaken
human instincts and desires,

713
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,711
and bring joy and pleasure
to the masses,

714
00:42:49,795 --> 00:42:51,671
isn’t that what adult romance
is all about?

715
00:42:54,716 --> 00:42:57,093
This is the personal gym.

716
00:42:59,763 --> 00:43:03,225
This is a lat pulldown machine,
used for working out the upper back.

717
00:43:03,266 --> 00:43:05,101
Want to give it a try?
I’ll help with your posture.

718
00:43:05,769 --> 00:43:07,938
Should I?

719
00:43:07,938 --> 00:43:09,439
Hold onto this,

720
00:43:09,981 --> 00:43:11,316
and sit down.

721
00:43:12,692 --> 00:43:15,946
Just pull, but focus on
using your back.

722
00:43:16,112 --> 00:43:17,781
Go ahead and pull.

723
00:43:18,990 --> 00:43:20,867
Push your back in like this.

724
00:43:21,785 --> 00:43:23,036
Once more,

725
00:43:23,286 --> 00:43:24,955
push your chest out.

726
00:43:25,539 --> 00:43:26,915
You’re doing well.

727
00:43:27,415 --> 00:43:29,209
One more time.

728
00:43:31,795 --> 00:43:33,088
One second.

729
00:43:33,922 --> 00:43:35,382
It’s getting a bit hot.

730
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:41,012
Sir...

731
00:43:41,346 --> 00:43:42,389
next time...

732
00:43:42,389 --> 00:43:43,557
It’s okay.

733
00:43:43,557 --> 00:43:45,976
Bad posture can cause injuries,
so, let me spot you.

734
00:43:45,976 --> 00:43:47,060
Go ahead, grab it.

735
00:43:47,936 --> 00:43:49,020
Good.

736
00:43:52,315 --> 00:43:53,400
That’s it.

737
00:44:05,912 --> 00:44:07,205
Can I kiss you?

738
00:44:08,498 --> 00:44:10,292
You already did though...

739
00:44:18,842 --> 00:44:20,051
Wait a minute...

740
00:44:20,760 --> 00:44:22,387
Sorry...

741
00:44:56,254 --> 00:44:59,299
So, who did you do it with?
Your boyfriend? The other guy?

742
00:44:59,966 --> 00:45:02,219
Obviously... here we go.

743
00:45:04,554 --> 00:45:05,764
Obviously, what?

744
00:45:06,515 --> 00:45:08,016
Both of them.

745
00:45:08,517 --> 00:45:09,559
You are incredible!

746
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:12,229
Then who did you do it with first?

747
00:45:12,813 --> 00:45:13,855
Both at once.

748
00:45:14,314 --> 00:45:15,232
What?

749
00:45:15,607 --> 00:45:16,942
A threesome?

750
00:45:17,067 --> 00:45:19,486
You had a threesome?
In Korea?

751
00:45:20,028 --> 00:45:21,196
Was it consensual?

752
00:45:21,196 --> 00:45:23,532
Can you tell everyone in the world?

753
00:45:23,657 --> 00:45:25,075
Let’s go as princesses.

754
00:45:26,284 --> 00:45:27,786
You need to put some lipstick on.

755
00:45:27,786 --> 00:45:28,912
I don’t have one.

756
00:45:29,746 --> 00:45:30,831
Let me borrow this.

757
00:45:32,666 --> 00:45:34,084
This one’s huge.

758
00:45:34,793 --> 00:45:36,044
Is it new?

759
00:45:37,629 --> 00:45:38,964
No!

760
00:45:56,523 --> 00:45:58,900
No matter how you look at it,

761
00:45:59,359 --> 00:46:01,403
it’s super convincing.

762
00:46:01,695 --> 00:46:03,989
This is the best for climaxing.

763
00:46:04,030 --> 00:46:07,951
I’m dating my boyfriend
for eight years because of this.

764
00:46:07,951 --> 00:46:11,079
What’s so good about vibration?

765
00:46:12,038 --> 00:46:14,666
Innocent child, the reason is,

766
00:46:15,292 --> 00:46:17,043
the clitoris is like the man’s dick.

767
00:46:17,043 --> 00:46:20,005
If you rub this vibrator on it...

768
00:46:20,172 --> 00:46:21,590
That’s so hot.

769
00:46:26,386 --> 00:46:30,015
People think the clit is just the tip,
but that’s only the tip of the iceberg,

770
00:46:30,098 --> 00:46:33,685
the clitoral roots split into two branches
and surround the entrance of the vagina.

771
00:46:33,768 --> 00:46:37,814
That’s why thicker things feel good
because they stimulate the clitoral roots.

772
00:46:38,106 --> 00:46:39,900
‘G-spot’.

773
00:46:39,983 --> 00:46:42,402
As for the length...

774
00:46:44,529 --> 00:46:46,531
an iPhone mini is enough.

775
00:46:46,531 --> 00:46:49,075
Hey, show me your phone.

776
00:46:51,453 --> 00:46:55,165
But there are two more spots
deeper inside the vagina.

777
00:46:55,165 --> 00:46:58,001
So if it’s thick and long,

778
00:46:58,627 --> 00:47:00,212
it’s the best.

779
00:47:00,212 --> 00:47:02,422
Galaxy Ultra, you win!

780
00:47:02,422 --> 00:47:03,507
I win!

781
00:47:06,927 --> 00:47:09,930
This reminds me of when
your boyfriend was in military service.

782
00:47:09,930 --> 00:47:10,847
Jeez...

783
00:47:11,723 --> 00:47:14,810
During your eight-year
relationship with Hee-min,

784
00:47:15,018 --> 00:47:17,229
you never cheated once?

785
00:47:18,688 --> 00:47:20,357
Kang Jung-hye, you should spill it too.

786
00:47:20,357 --> 00:47:21,149
What is it?

787
00:47:21,233 --> 00:47:23,318
Private Kang Jung-hye,
what do you mean?

788
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:23,860
You did?

789
00:47:23,860 --> 00:47:25,821
Didn’t you also have
a little something?

790
00:47:25,821 --> 00:47:26,822
Shutting up, sir.

791
00:47:26,822 --> 00:47:28,573
Confess and find redemption!

792
00:47:28,573 --> 00:47:30,659
What is it? I’m curious, soldier!

793
00:47:31,743 --> 00:47:33,036
Everyone, attention!

794
00:47:35,038 --> 00:47:35,956
Salute!

795
00:47:36,039 --> 00:47:37,499
Loyalty!

796
00:47:44,047 --> 00:47:46,133
We had chemical warfare
training today,

797
00:47:46,133 --> 00:47:47,926
and everyone was in tears...

798
00:47:47,926 --> 00:47:48,969
Sorry.

799
00:47:49,594 --> 00:47:50,971
Army talk is boring, right?

800
00:47:51,096 --> 00:47:52,055
Nope.

801
00:47:52,347 --> 00:47:54,808
I’m just glad to hear your voice.

802
00:47:56,810 --> 00:47:59,146
It reminds me of the eve
of your enlistment.

803
00:48:00,355 --> 00:48:03,984
Yeah, I remember,
everyone was drunk...

804
00:48:04,943 --> 00:48:08,113
Dummy, I wasn’t drunk.

805
00:48:08,280 --> 00:48:11,741
If Dan-bi wasn’t there,

806
00:48:11,908 --> 00:48:14,369
I’d have done stuff to you.

807
00:48:14,744 --> 00:48:15,662
What?

808
00:48:16,413 --> 00:48:20,125
If she wasn’t there,

809
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,296
would you have done
something to me?

810
00:48:26,798 --> 00:48:29,092
Uh, sure, yeah...

811
00:48:29,885 --> 00:48:30,886
How?

812
00:48:33,597 --> 00:48:35,515
How would you have done it?

813
00:48:35,557 --> 00:48:37,559
Uh, everything you like...

814
00:48:40,562 --> 00:48:43,398
What I like? What’s that?

815
00:48:43,648 --> 00:48:44,900
Tell me.

816
00:48:46,526 --> 00:48:48,195
You love it when I stroke your hair.

817
00:48:48,195 --> 00:48:50,071
Kiss you while stroking you...

818
00:48:50,405 --> 00:48:51,698
And then?

819
00:48:53,700 --> 00:48:55,827
Hug you, and then...

820
00:48:56,077 --> 00:48:58,538
And then? Then what?

821
00:48:59,122 --> 00:49:00,749
Go ahead
or I’m hanging up.

822
00:49:00,749 --> 00:49:02,000
Hey, hey!

823
00:49:02,459 --> 00:49:05,253
I’d, like, just,
touch you, like this...

824
00:49:05,545 --> 00:49:06,922
- Yours?
- Mine...

825
00:49:07,172 --> 00:49:08,507
What about yours?

826
00:49:08,507 --> 00:49:10,008
- Mine, uh...
- Is it hard?

827
00:49:10,342 --> 00:49:12,093
Tell me more!

828
00:49:15,472 --> 00:49:17,307
Sweetie,
someone’s here.

829
00:49:17,432 --> 00:49:18,308
What?

830
00:49:18,642 --> 00:49:20,644
I’ll come visit you,
I gotta go.

831
00:49:20,644 --> 00:49:21,645
Wait, Jung-hye!

832
00:49:24,606 --> 00:49:26,149
Jung-hye!

833
00:49:34,950 --> 00:49:36,326
Jung-hye!

834
00:49:41,373 --> 00:49:42,791
Jung Hee-min, perfect shot.

835
00:49:49,089 --> 00:49:49,881
Salute!

836
00:49:49,881 --> 00:49:50,632
Hey.

837
00:49:50,632 --> 00:49:51,883
You ranked first in training.

838
00:49:51,883 --> 00:49:53,927
Here.
You got an overnight leave.

839
00:49:53,927 --> 00:49:55,554
Private First Class,
Jung Hee-min!

840
00:49:55,554 --> 00:49:57,514
Overnight Leave Granted
Thank you!

841
00:50:03,937 --> 00:50:05,105
Jung Hee-min!

842
00:50:05,313 --> 00:50:06,231
Salute!

843
00:50:06,606 --> 00:50:08,316
Private First Class,
Jung Hee-min!

844
00:50:08,525 --> 00:50:10,610
You’re lucky,
your girlfriend’s here.

845
00:50:11,361 --> 00:50:12,612
Take the return vehicle later.

846
00:50:12,612 --> 00:50:13,238
Jung-hye!

847
00:50:13,238 --> 00:50:14,906
Take the return vehicle!

848
00:50:16,741 --> 00:50:17,784
Jung-hye!

849
00:50:21,413 --> 00:50:22,205
No way...

850
00:50:27,544 --> 00:50:28,962
How long has it been?

851
00:50:29,504 --> 00:50:31,631
About three years, I think?

852
00:50:31,631 --> 00:50:34,426
Who did you come here to see?

853
00:50:35,677 --> 00:50:36,803
Um...

854
00:50:38,472 --> 00:50:39,389
my cousin.

855
00:50:39,389 --> 00:50:40,223
I see.

856
00:50:46,646 --> 00:50:47,898
Goddammit!

857
00:50:48,356 --> 00:50:50,066
Sorry for what happened back then.

858
00:50:51,067 --> 00:50:54,154
No, it’s fine,
I forgot all about it.

859
00:50:55,322 --> 00:50:58,408
I’m getting discharged soon,
can I contact you then?

860
00:50:59,367 --> 00:51:00,243
What?

861
00:51:04,706 --> 00:51:06,708
It’s already time for me to go.

862
00:51:06,708 --> 00:51:09,044
The last bus is coming,
I have to go.

863
00:51:09,795 --> 00:51:10,837
Sorry.

864
00:51:14,132 --> 00:51:15,592
I’ve missed you...

865
00:51:33,902 --> 00:51:34,945
Stop...

866
00:51:47,207 --> 00:51:49,459
With Grit! With Guts! Give It All!

867
00:51:51,253 --> 00:51:53,296
Pvt. Jung, go to the family visitation room.

868
00:51:53,839 --> 00:51:55,006
Jung-hye.

869
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:09,604
- Are you okay?
- Sorry, sorry...

870
00:53:10,916 --> 00:53:12,751
Baby! Don’t get sick and do well.
I’ll be waiting for you.

871
00:53:12,751 --> 00:53:13,960
Baby! Don’t get sick and do well.
I’ll be waiting for you.
Jung-hye...

872
00:53:14,336 --> 00:53:16,546
Sorry for being late...

873
00:53:20,634 --> 00:53:21,927
Jung-hye!

874
00:53:24,971 --> 00:53:25,806
What is it?

875
00:53:25,972 --> 00:53:27,224
Does something feel off?

876
00:53:27,265 --> 00:53:28,600
No, not at all.

877
00:53:29,142 --> 00:53:30,560
It’s even more solid.

878
00:53:31,645 --> 00:53:33,188
The story, I mean.

879
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,192
I’ll get going now, I’m tired...

880
00:53:37,192 --> 00:53:39,528
Help me out a bit.

881
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:41,279
Let’s go together.

882
00:53:43,573 --> 00:53:44,908
Why are you walking like that?

883
00:53:44,908 --> 00:53:46,493
I’ve been sitting for too long...

884
00:53:52,499 --> 00:53:53,500
Aren’t you getting in?

885
00:53:53,500 --> 00:53:55,252
Yes, I will.

886
00:54:18,275 --> 00:54:19,985
Coming in!

887
00:54:36,835 --> 00:54:37,752
Excuse me.

888
00:54:38,253 --> 00:54:39,087
Yes?

889
00:54:39,337 --> 00:54:40,213
What is it?

890
00:54:40,213 --> 00:54:41,465
It’s nothing...

891
00:55:02,027 --> 00:55:03,945
Why isn’t she answering?

892
00:55:04,404 --> 00:55:05,489
Something wrong?

893
00:55:05,489 --> 00:55:06,573
No, it’s just...

894
00:55:07,157 --> 00:55:08,950
I feel shitty for some reason.

895
00:55:10,243 --> 00:55:11,953
You must really like her.

896
00:55:14,664 --> 00:55:16,416
She’s a very pure person.

897
00:55:16,792 --> 00:55:19,795
Her mind is filled with
nothing but fairy tales.

898
00:55:20,212 --> 00:55:21,588
I see...

899
00:55:36,061 --> 00:55:37,771
Eh? There’s no room?

900
00:55:37,771 --> 00:55:39,439
No, no, there is.

901
00:55:39,439 --> 00:55:40,690
- Come in, come!
- Yeah?

902
00:55:41,233 --> 00:55:42,567
Pardon me!

903
00:55:44,486 --> 00:55:45,654
Thank you!

904
00:56:13,223 --> 00:56:15,767
‘Real Man’? This is a bit...

905
00:56:17,686 --> 00:56:18,895
By the way,

906
00:56:19,938 --> 00:56:23,066
who did you learn to write from?

907
00:56:23,066 --> 00:56:23,817
Why?

908
00:56:24,484 --> 00:56:25,402
What’s weird this time?

909
00:56:25,402 --> 00:56:27,028
No, no, it’s good.

910
00:56:27,028 --> 00:56:31,324
The basics are really solid,
that’s why I’m asking.

911
00:56:31,533 --> 00:56:32,868
Who was it?

912
00:56:32,993 --> 00:56:34,619
From my dad.

913
00:56:34,995 --> 00:56:36,788
Oh, your dad.

914
00:56:36,872 --> 00:56:40,917
He won the National
Literary Contest in 2003.

915
00:56:40,917 --> 00:56:43,044
Is that so?

916
00:56:43,170 --> 00:56:46,423
If it was in 2003...

917
00:56:46,548 --> 00:56:49,593
‘The Adventures of Thomas’,

918
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:53,054
Yoon Kang-chul’s daughter?!

919
00:56:53,054 --> 00:56:55,640
Yes, you knew my dad?!

920
00:56:57,976 --> 00:56:59,227
Too well!

921
00:56:59,478 --> 00:57:01,104
Next, we have the acceptance speech

922
00:57:01,104 --> 00:57:03,482
from the grand prize winner,
Yoon Kang-chul.

923
00:57:03,690 --> 00:57:04,816
Thank you so much.

924
00:57:05,066 --> 00:57:06,485
Excuse me.

925
00:57:06,651 --> 00:57:08,904
Dan-bi, I won an award.

926
00:57:09,821 --> 00:57:12,949
Hye-jin, our hard times are over now.

927
00:57:13,283 --> 00:57:14,659
Like hell it is.

928
00:57:14,659 --> 00:57:17,078
Anyone can win
a grand prize nowadays?

929
00:57:17,078 --> 00:57:18,497
Could you leave, please?

930
00:57:18,497 --> 00:57:19,873
Why did I lose, huh?

931
00:57:19,915 --> 00:57:20,916
Let go of me!

932
00:57:20,916 --> 00:57:23,335
Did you all even read
my entry properly?!

933
00:57:23,376 --> 00:57:26,630
Respect creative freedom!

934
00:57:27,339 --> 00:57:30,383
Yoon Kang-chul’s daughter...

935
00:57:31,635 --> 00:57:33,261
Very interesting...

936
00:57:34,638 --> 00:57:36,223
- Specs!
- Yes?

937
00:57:36,223 --> 00:57:38,141
Upload both titles.

938
00:57:44,147 --> 00:57:45,148
Dan-bi!

939
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:48,401
Yes?

940
00:57:48,944 --> 00:57:50,320
Congrats on your debut.

941
00:57:53,615 --> 00:57:54,783
Amazing!

942
00:57:54,950 --> 00:57:57,744
But why’s my pen name ‘Firefox’?
That’s so cheesy.

943
00:57:57,953 --> 00:58:01,414
‘Elevator’ Popularity Ranking

944
00:58:01,414 --> 00:58:02,207
‘Elevator’ Popularity Ranking: #17

945
00:58:02,249 --> 00:58:04,000
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

946
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:08,463
My God, Dan-bi, it’s nuts.

947
00:58:08,463 --> 00:58:10,006
Did you take something?

948
00:58:10,090 --> 00:58:11,633
I took a little something.

949
00:58:11,758 --> 00:58:14,594
It’s clearly about me,
but I got turned on reading it.

950
00:58:15,262 --> 00:58:16,179
Really turned on?

951
00:58:16,179 --> 00:58:17,180
Totally turned on.

952
00:58:18,557 --> 00:58:22,060
Life is like a fairy tale!

953
00:58:22,435 --> 00:58:24,437
Sometimes hard,
but we can overcome it!

954
00:58:24,521 --> 00:58:28,024
Dan-bi is like sweet rain
during a drought.

955
00:58:32,362 --> 00:58:33,446
Dan-bi.

956
00:58:34,656 --> 00:58:36,074
Sober up.

957
00:58:36,867 --> 00:58:38,285
Thank you.

958
00:59:23,455 --> 00:59:24,915
What’s the matter?

959
00:59:26,041 --> 00:59:27,125
Nothing.

960
00:59:28,168 --> 00:59:29,461
It’s good, right?

961
00:59:31,004 --> 00:59:32,005
Jung-seok,

962
00:59:32,464 --> 00:59:33,965
you know what?

963
00:59:34,174 --> 00:59:38,804
The most common flirting move
between men and women...

964
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:41,807
is sharing ice cream together.

965
00:59:43,642 --> 00:59:47,479
I just wanted to...
help you sober up.

966
00:59:48,146 --> 00:59:49,481
That’s what I’m saying.

967
00:59:50,106 --> 00:59:51,983
I’m enjoying this buzz,

968
00:59:52,025 --> 00:59:55,237
why are you trying to
sober me up?

969
00:59:55,570 --> 00:59:59,866
You have to write fairy tales
and erotica too...

970
01:00:01,660 --> 01:00:04,496
I know you’re serious about writing,
whatever it may be.

971
01:00:05,330 --> 01:00:06,540
That’s why.

972
01:00:09,042 --> 01:00:10,085
Jung-seok.

973
01:00:11,294 --> 01:00:14,005
Is that why you helped me so much?

974
01:00:14,089 --> 01:00:18,218
Just like you started writing
erotica for money,

975
01:00:18,802 --> 01:00:21,012
and then it became sincere,
it’s the same for me.

976
01:00:21,096 --> 01:00:24,516
I wasn’t sure at first, but now
I’m sincerely cheering for you.

977
01:00:24,516 --> 01:00:26,852
For you to become a great writer.

978
01:00:27,310 --> 01:00:30,730
Do I really seem that serious
about erotica?

979
01:00:31,606 --> 01:00:35,193
Don’t you like it?
You seem really happy lately...

980
01:00:37,779 --> 01:00:38,822
Did I?

981
01:00:38,822 --> 01:00:43,785
Being talented at something
you love is a real blessing.

982
01:00:44,369 --> 01:00:48,623
Not just anyone can be
ranked 17th in the nation.

983
01:00:48,748 --> 01:00:51,835
That genre is rising in popularity.

984
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:54,254
Cross.

985
01:00:57,883 --> 01:00:58,925
Butterfly Sleep Publishing

986
01:00:58,925 --> 01:01:00,594
‘The Adventures of Raindrops’
has improved a lot.

987
01:01:00,594 --> 01:01:02,929
Just fine-tune the details
and it’ll be good.

988
01:01:03,054 --> 01:01:03,763
Seriously?

989
01:01:03,763 --> 01:01:05,140
The concept is fun.

990
01:01:05,140 --> 01:01:07,392
Some raindrops are lucky enough
to be Evian,

991
01:01:07,476 --> 01:01:11,229
while others become toilet water...

992
01:01:12,939 --> 01:01:14,566
I wrote some notes.

993
01:01:16,860 --> 01:01:18,069
Thank you.

994
01:01:18,069 --> 01:01:21,531
I’ve been bragging about you a lot,
work hard to win this contest!

995
01:01:21,531 --> 01:01:23,200
Of course, I’ll do my best.

996
01:01:23,742 --> 01:01:25,952
Let’s watch this together.

997
01:01:26,161 --> 01:01:28,789
This is the latest trend overseas.

998
01:01:33,084 --> 01:01:33,919
What the heck?!

999
01:01:33,919 --> 01:01:35,837
Why is this trash popping up?

1000
01:01:35,921 --> 01:01:36,922
Hold on...

1001
01:01:37,005 --> 01:01:38,632
You can press this--

1002
01:01:39,883 --> 01:01:42,469
You can never look at these.

1003
01:01:42,594 --> 01:01:43,762
Got that?

1004
01:01:44,429 --> 01:01:45,597
Understand?

1005
01:01:46,765 --> 01:01:47,641
Yes...

1006
01:01:47,933 --> 01:01:49,810
You can do it, Dan-bi!

1007
01:01:56,107 --> 01:01:58,860
How would he react
if he finds out I write erotica?

1008
01:02:01,404 --> 01:02:02,739
What am I saying?

1009
01:02:03,156 --> 01:02:07,744
I’m going back to fairy tales
after I pay back $100,000.

1010
01:02:08,411 --> 01:02:09,454
Let’s focus.

1011
01:02:12,207 --> 01:02:19,297
Thomas, who was making cheese,
shouted at Josephina,

1012
01:02:19,756 --> 01:02:21,925
“I’m running out of milk!”

1013
01:02:22,467 --> 01:02:27,055
Then he embraced her from behind,

1014
01:02:27,055 --> 01:02:29,432
and started milking her.

1015
01:02:30,058 --> 01:02:34,271
With Thomas’s gentle touch...

1016
01:02:34,855 --> 01:02:38,316
Josephina’s closed lips parted...

1017
01:02:44,281 --> 01:02:46,324
Oh God, I must be crazy.

1018
01:02:47,075 --> 01:02:49,953
Clear your mind,
focus, let’s focus again.

1019
01:02:52,205 --> 01:02:54,749
Then Josephina

1020
01:02:54,749 --> 01:02:56,460
called out.

1021
01:02:56,960 --> 01:03:00,213
“Thomas!”, “Josephina!”

1022
01:03:01,339 --> 01:03:02,549
“Thomas!”

1023
01:03:03,258 --> 01:03:04,759
“Josephina!”

1024
01:03:05,886 --> 01:03:07,012
“Thomas!”

1025
01:03:07,012 --> 01:03:08,472
“Josephina!”

1026
01:03:08,972 --> 01:03:10,599
“Thomas!”

1027
01:03:11,391 --> 01:03:12,893
“Josephina!”

1028
01:03:14,686 --> 01:03:15,854
Shit!

1029
01:03:18,523 --> 01:03:22,194
It’s because
I didn’t sleep well today.

1030
01:03:25,071 --> 01:03:27,032
Let’s just call it a day.

1031
01:03:43,507 --> 01:03:46,051
Am I possessed by a slutty demon?

1032
01:04:06,822 --> 01:04:09,324
I still feel like he’s still inside me
even after filling me up.

1033
01:04:09,324 --> 01:04:12,828
My heated heart opens wide.

1034
01:04:17,749 --> 01:04:21,169
Every time I rode him,
I thought of Jin-woo,

1035
01:04:21,169 --> 01:04:23,004
and I bit my lip, afraid I might
call his name.

1036
01:04:24,005 --> 01:04:25,882
What is wrong with me?

1037
01:04:41,022 --> 01:04:45,360
Their back pockets are cut open
to let their skin touch.

1038
01:04:45,819 --> 01:04:48,321
Crap, this is driving me insane...

1039
01:04:54,161 --> 01:04:55,871
My brother-in-law held me
so desperately.

1040
01:04:55,871 --> 01:04:58,748
Even though I knew I shouldn’t,
I couldn’t help but sit down.

1041
01:05:05,213 --> 01:05:07,716
The divorcee still enjoys
secret dates with me today.

1042
01:05:08,550 --> 01:05:11,970
As soon as I met up with him,
my #1 started to heat up.

1043
01:05:22,189 --> 01:05:23,356
Phone sex while walking.

1044
01:05:23,356 --> 01:05:24,733
I want to defend myself
from his thumping attack.

1045
01:05:24,733 --> 01:05:25,984
I started to get wet from his scent.

1046
01:05:25,984 --> 01:05:27,194
I want to have sex.

1047
01:05:34,409 --> 01:05:35,869
Her irresistibly soft skin
made me hard.

1048
01:05:36,203 --> 01:05:37,788
When did my childhood friend’s #1,
become this massive?

1049
01:05:37,788 --> 01:05:38,997
How many men have you slept with?

1050
01:05:48,256 --> 01:05:49,299
... check it out?

1051
01:05:49,299 --> 01:05:51,676
The word “ecstasy” means to me...

1052
01:05:53,261 --> 01:05:55,138
5 - Elevator

1053
01:06:00,101 --> 01:06:03,271
I can talk about ecstasy
in the clouds.

1054
01:06:07,317 --> 01:06:09,486
Look! We did it!

1055
01:06:09,486 --> 01:06:10,487
Damn...

1056
01:06:10,487 --> 01:06:11,738
I knew it, huh?

1057
01:06:11,738 --> 01:06:13,532
Like father, like daughter!

1058
01:06:15,575 --> 01:06:18,870
Thank you, Yoon Kang-chul!
You taught her well!

1059
01:06:22,791 --> 01:06:24,292
Do you like your studio?

1060
01:06:24,376 --> 01:06:25,418
Yes, thank you.

1061
01:06:25,418 --> 01:06:29,422
It’s hard to catch on so quickly,
you’re a natural.

1062
01:06:30,215 --> 01:06:31,883
Let’s partner up for good.

1063
01:06:32,050 --> 01:06:34,594
Don’t say that, I’m going to
write fairy tales.

1064
01:06:34,594 --> 01:06:36,096
I’m never writing erotica
after the contract.

1065
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:36,805
Alright.

1066
01:06:36,805 --> 01:06:38,890
You know the next deadline
is tomorrow, right?

1067
01:06:39,057 --> 01:06:39,850
Yes.

1068
01:06:43,770 --> 01:06:45,063
Hi, Ha-neul.

1069
01:06:46,022 --> 01:06:47,983
I’m almost done with revisions.

1070
01:06:48,817 --> 01:06:51,486
I think I can submit it
before midnight.

1071
01:06:52,529 --> 01:06:53,446
Okay.

1072
01:06:54,447 --> 01:06:55,782
Ms. Yoon Dan-bi?

1073
01:06:57,784 --> 01:06:59,911
Firefox, right?

1074
01:07:01,079 --> 01:07:02,414
Who are you?

1075
01:07:04,666 --> 01:07:06,626
The Adventures of Raindrops

1076
01:07:06,835 --> 01:07:09,838
‘Repetition of synonyms is
not allowed in this context.’

1077
01:07:11,756 --> 01:07:14,634
‘Repetition of synonyms is
not allowed in this context’?

1078
01:07:17,262 --> 01:07:18,847
What does this even mean?

1079
01:07:19,806 --> 01:07:21,683
Screwed it, it’s already midnight...

1080
01:07:22,309 --> 01:07:23,894
Let’s finish the erotica first.

1081
01:07:24,019 --> 01:07:27,814
Secret Dissection Class

1082
01:07:35,530 --> 01:07:37,199
Yes, I submitted it.

1083
01:07:43,830 --> 01:07:46,541
This is taking a toll on you,

1084
01:07:46,917 --> 01:07:49,377
what’s the real reason
you want to write fairy tales?

1085
01:07:51,004 --> 01:07:54,591
My dad was a fairy tale writer.

1086
01:07:54,966 --> 01:08:00,138
Every time he released a book,
a Harry Potter book would come out,

1087
01:08:00,263 --> 01:08:01,932
and his books got crushed.

1088
01:08:03,433 --> 01:08:07,979
He went through a lot of hardship
and passed away from illness,

1089
01:08:08,104 --> 01:08:09,731
but I made a promise to him,

1090
01:08:09,981 --> 01:08:12,943
that I would become
a great fairy tale writer.

1091
01:08:14,027 --> 01:08:17,948
So, fairy tales aren’t your dream
but a promise to him?

1092
01:08:19,115 --> 01:08:20,826
That is my dream.

1093
01:08:20,867 --> 01:08:22,202
After that?

1094
01:08:22,202 --> 01:08:23,036
What?

1095
01:08:23,203 --> 01:08:26,373
After you fulfill your promise,

1096
01:08:26,373 --> 01:08:27,332
then what?

1097
01:08:28,291 --> 01:08:31,211
Well, I’ll continue to...

1098
01:08:33,130 --> 01:08:34,297
One sec.

1099
01:08:37,050 --> 01:08:38,176
Hello?

1100
01:08:38,718 --> 01:08:39,719
Yes, I submitted it.

1101
01:08:39,719 --> 01:08:42,305
What the heck is
‘The Adventures of Raindrops’?

1102
01:08:42,305 --> 01:08:43,098
What?

1103
01:08:43,473 --> 01:08:45,392
How did you get that?

1104
01:08:45,767 --> 01:08:46,768
Hold on...

1105
01:08:48,687 --> 01:08:49,771
No way...

1106
01:08:50,313 --> 01:08:51,273
One moment.

1109
01:09:00,407 --> 01:09:03,618
How-how do I cancel
a mis-sent email?

1110
01:09:03,827 --> 01:09:06,788
You can only delete it
before they check, why?

1111
01:09:06,830 --> 01:09:08,290
Shoot, I must be insane!

1112
01:09:08,415 --> 01:09:10,750
I submitted my erotica
to the fairytale contest.

1113
01:09:10,750 --> 01:09:11,835
What do I do?

1114
01:09:12,085 --> 01:09:13,170
What do...

1115
01:09:18,383 --> 01:09:19,634
I’m sorry.

1116
01:09:21,178 --> 01:09:22,262
Taxi!

1117
01:09:22,262 --> 01:09:23,430
Dang it...

1118
01:09:27,309 --> 01:09:28,518
Taxi!

1119
01:09:29,936 --> 01:09:32,147
Crap, what do I do?

1120
01:09:35,025 --> 01:09:36,193
Dan-bi!

1121
01:09:37,027 --> 01:09:38,195
Get in!

1122
01:09:42,449 --> 01:09:43,617
Thank you!

01:09:51,082 --> 01:09:54,795
You messed up, Dan-bi!

1125
01:09:55,420 --> 01:09:57,881
What the heck do I do?

1126
01:09:58,256 --> 01:10:00,759
Just say it was a mistake.

1127
01:10:01,009 --> 01:10:02,511
Or say you got hacked.

1128
01:10:02,511 --> 01:10:04,095
Who would believe that?

1129
01:10:06,681 --> 01:10:09,017
I’ll just get off here.

1130
01:10:09,267 --> 01:10:10,143
What?

1131
01:10:14,147 --> 01:10:15,398
Dan-bi!

1132
01:10:17,609 --> 01:10:19,569
Dan-bi! Take my umbrella!

1133
01:10:21,822 --> 01:10:23,323
It’s raining...

1134
01:10:23,615 --> 01:10:24,783
Sorry!

1135
01:10:29,579 --> 01:10:31,248
I’m sorry! Sorry!

1136
01:10:41,591 --> 01:10:42,592
Hello.

1137
01:10:42,759 --> 01:10:47,305
I submitted my entry last night.

1138
01:10:47,889 --> 01:10:49,015
Ma’am?

1139
01:10:50,725 --> 01:10:51,560
Hello.

1140
01:10:51,726 --> 01:10:53,520
I submitted it right before
the deadline--

1141
01:10:53,520 --> 01:10:54,604
Ms. Yoon Dan-bi?

1142
01:10:54,604 --> 01:10:55,981
Yes, what happened was--

1143
01:10:55,981 --> 01:10:57,274
Firefox.

1144
01:10:58,066 --> 01:11:00,402
Is it fun to mess with us?

1145
01:11:00,735 --> 01:11:02,487
Do we look like a joke to you?

1146
01:11:02,612 --> 01:11:05,448
No, that’s not it,
what happened was, I--

1147
01:11:05,448 --> 01:11:06,408
Go away.

1148
01:11:06,908 --> 01:11:09,035
This isn’t a place
for people like you.

1149
01:11:10,203 --> 01:11:11,496
Could you check this?

1150
01:11:11,496 --> 01:11:12,622
Yes, ma’am.

1151
01:11:39,983 --> 01:11:43,320
Right, of course not.

1152
01:11:43,403 --> 01:11:45,071
Please don’t worry.

1153
01:11:46,323 --> 01:11:48,909
Of course, it’s a baseless rumor.

1154
01:11:51,620 --> 01:11:54,498
Yes, I don’t know her.

1155
01:12:06,176 --> 01:12:07,886
Ha-neul, what happened was--

1156
01:12:07,886 --> 01:12:09,304
I don’t want to know.

1157
01:12:11,014 --> 01:12:12,808
Could you listen to me
for a second?

1158
01:12:12,808 --> 01:12:14,768
The truth is, I’ve been working--

1159
01:12:15,560 --> 01:12:18,063
How could you
embarrass me like that?!

1160
01:12:21,399 --> 01:12:25,445
I’m barely holding back right now.

1161

Secret Dissection Class

1162
01:12:36,248 --> 01:12:38,250
Don’t go around saying
you write fairy tales.

1163
01:12:39,084 --> 01:12:40,627
You’re not a writer.

1164
01:12:51,054 --> 01:12:54,141
Ms. Yoon, could you
open the door? It’s me.

1165
01:12:54,266 --> 01:12:55,559
Ms. Yoon!

1166
01:12:59,437 --> 01:13:02,649
You’re inside!
I can hear the ringing!

1167
01:13:03,275 --> 01:13:04,609
Jesus Christ...

1168
01:13:05,652 --> 01:13:06,903
Jeez...

1169
01:13:09,114 --> 01:13:11,616
Should I give it all up
and just write erotica?

1170
01:13:12,325 --> 01:13:13,869
That would be great.

1171
01:13:14,161 --> 01:13:16,746
Who cares what people say, right?

1172
01:13:17,080 --> 01:13:18,248
Sure...

1173
01:13:18,665 --> 01:13:22,752
Since I only need my laptop,
I could write while traveling.

1174
01:13:22,752 --> 01:13:23,753
That’s true.

1175
01:13:24,212 --> 01:13:25,338
That sounds amazing.

1176
01:13:28,133 --> 01:13:29,885
Thanks for the coffee, I’m off.

1177
01:13:30,135 --> 01:13:31,720
Leaving already?

1178
01:13:32,053 --> 01:13:33,930
I see that you’re fine,
so I better be going.

1179
01:13:33,930 --> 01:13:35,891
No point in staying.

1180
01:13:36,224 --> 01:13:38,268
Do I look fine?

1181
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:42,647
Do I look okay?

1182
01:13:42,856 --> 01:13:45,108
Who do you think
messed up my life?

1183
01:13:45,275 --> 01:13:49,196
You barged into my life,
I was doing just fine...

1184
01:13:49,905 --> 01:13:52,073
Is that so?

1185
01:13:52,407 --> 01:13:54,910
I did that?

1186
01:13:55,076 --> 01:13:58,955
I ruined your life
by barging into it?

1187
01:14:01,374 --> 01:14:02,876
Only fairy tales matter?

1188
01:14:03,710 --> 01:14:08,298
If you just drop this prejudice
about what’s okay and what’s not,

1189
01:14:09,090 --> 01:14:12,344
your life would’ve been much freer.

1190
01:14:13,887 --> 01:14:16,848
Were you happy writing fairy tales?

1191
01:14:18,350 --> 01:14:22,354
It wasn’t just a task you had to
complete for your father?

1192
01:14:23,897 --> 01:14:25,315
Tell me I’m wrong.

1193
01:14:40,705 --> 01:14:43,667
Don’t worry, she’ll be back.

1194
01:14:43,959 --> 01:14:44,918
He ran off twice.

1195
01:14:44,918 --> 01:14:46,545
Three times for this guy.

1196
01:14:46,545 --> 01:14:48,880
At least I answered my phone.

1197
01:14:49,005 --> 01:14:50,048
I was sick.

1198
01:14:50,048 --> 01:14:53,218
Good job, so proud of you two.

1199
01:14:53,760 --> 01:14:55,720
Stop it, will you?

1200
01:14:55,887 --> 01:14:57,806
If she doesn’t come back,
there’s nothing we can do.

1201
01:14:58,014 --> 01:14:59,307
Here, take this.

1202
01:15:09,317 --> 01:15:10,735
The princess left

1203
01:15:10,861 --> 01:15:13,655
for the prince’s kingdom.

1204
01:15:21,329 --> 01:15:22,998
Did you eat?

1205
01:15:29,171 --> 01:15:35,218
So, you watched 50 pornos a day,
and sent erotica to the contest?

1206
01:15:35,969 --> 01:15:37,220
You think that’s funny?

1207
01:15:37,220 --> 01:15:38,638
It sure is!

1208
01:15:38,638 --> 01:15:43,059
I hadn’t laughed in a while,
you really are a good daughter.

1209
01:15:43,477 --> 01:15:46,771
Mom, should I just quit everything
and come live with you?

1210
01:15:47,272 --> 01:15:49,483
I’ll write fairy tales
under a pen name.

1211
01:15:50,609 --> 01:15:51,985
That sounds annoying.

1212
01:15:52,194 --> 01:15:56,448
Why are you and your dad
letting fairy tales run your lives?

1213
01:15:57,199 --> 01:15:59,242
I can’t even stand the sight of it.

1214
01:15:59,326 --> 01:16:02,579
If he hadn’t won it, he would’ve
done whatever he wanted.

1215
01:16:02,579 --> 01:16:04,122
He did, his whole life.

1216
01:16:04,247 --> 01:16:05,540
You don’t know?

1217
01:16:06,166 --> 01:16:08,543
He wrote fairy tales because of you.

1218
01:16:08,668 --> 01:16:11,922
You pumped him up by saying
he looked cool writing stories.

1219
01:16:12,214 --> 01:16:15,217
How could your simple dad
not resist that?

1220
01:16:15,842 --> 01:16:19,179
But now his kid writes
blasted fairy tales because of him?

1221
01:16:21,181 --> 01:16:22,224
Oh dear...

1222
01:16:22,891 --> 01:16:25,143
Like father, like daughter...

1223
01:16:40,075 --> 01:16:41,952
Messed up again!

1224
01:16:42,202 --> 01:16:43,120
Jeez...

1225
01:16:43,411 --> 01:16:44,454
Dan-bi.

1226
01:16:44,579 --> 01:16:46,748
What’s the website
for reading your stories?

1227
01:16:46,748 --> 01:16:47,666
I want to check it out.

1228
01:16:47,666 --> 01:16:49,501
Forget it, what for?

1229
01:16:49,501 --> 01:16:54,339
Why not? Let me read
my daughter’s erotica, okay?

1230
01:16:54,464 --> 01:16:55,757
No way.

1231
01:16:55,757 --> 01:16:57,259
Ma’am, I brought the book!

1232
01:16:57,259 --> 01:16:59,094
Okay, one second!

1233
01:16:59,678 --> 01:17:02,430
Pull it up before I get back.

1234
01:17:02,848 --> 01:17:03,515
Pull what up?

1235
01:17:03,515 --> 01:17:04,599
Hurry.

1236
01:17:05,517 --> 01:17:06,768
Come on...

#2 Real Man by Firefox

1238
01:17:18,363 --> 01:17:20,991
It’s finally posted!
Now my day can begin.

1239
01:17:21,324 --> 01:17:23,201
Nice! This’ll get me
through the week.

1240
01:17:23,410 --> 01:17:25,954
Where can I buy the merch?
This is a must-have.

1241
01:17:26,163 --> 01:17:27,581
Reminds me of my days as a private.

1242
01:17:27,706 --> 01:17:29,416
Hilarious, sexy and moving...

1243
01:17:29,583 --> 01:17:32,127
Thanks to this,
my marriage is thriving!

1244
01:17:33,086 --> 01:17:34,212
The author’s in her prime.

1245
01:17:34,379 --> 01:17:35,589
I want to do it.

1246
01:17:35,964 --> 01:17:39,092
Gonna savor every line.
So thrilling.

1247
01:17:39,426 --> 01:17:40,594
Did you find it?

1248
01:17:41,261 --> 01:17:42,220
Yeah.

1249
01:17:44,431 --> 01:17:45,390
Mom.

1250
01:17:47,184 --> 01:17:49,102
Did dad only write fairy tales?

1251
01:17:51,813 --> 01:17:53,648
It’s your dad’s treasure box.

1252
01:17:53,773 --> 01:17:54,900
Open it.

1253
01:18:27,933 --> 01:18:30,477
Dazzling Love

1254
01:18:34,856 --> 01:18:37,359
Yoon Kang-chul

1255
01:18:40,570 --> 01:18:44,616
She gasped for breath
and moaned softly.

1256
01:18:48,912 --> 01:18:51,039
On her soft breast...

1257
01:19:20,652 --> 01:19:21,736
Dad!

1258
01:19:21,903 --> 01:19:23,321
Hey, Dan-bi.

1259
01:19:25,115 --> 01:19:26,825
My sweetheart.

1260
01:19:27,534 --> 01:19:29,619
- Were you drawing?
- Yup.

1261
01:19:30,036 --> 01:19:31,997
- You drew this?
- Yup.

1262
01:19:32,289 --> 01:19:33,999
I’m gonna write fairy tales.

1263
01:19:36,042 --> 01:19:39,004
Don’t force yourself,
you don’t need to.

1264
01:19:39,588 --> 01:19:41,006
I want to.

1265
01:19:41,006 --> 01:19:43,049
- Dan-bi!
- Mom!

1266
01:20:06,781 --> 01:20:07,949
Dad...

1267
01:20:09,409 --> 01:20:11,703
Live the way you want to live.

1268
01:20:14,873 --> 01:20:18,585
I’ll cheer you on whatever it may be.

1269
01:20:45,529 --> 01:20:47,906
Forbidden Fairytale

1270
01:20:55,163 --> 01:20:56,581
What if she’s not here again?

1271
01:20:56,581 --> 01:20:59,167
She’s not coming back,
we’ll have to report her.

1272
01:20:59,167 --> 01:21:00,502
Let’s wait a few more days.

1273
01:21:00,502 --> 01:21:03,547
She’s not coming back,
if she does, I’ll bark like a dog.

1274
01:21:03,797 --> 01:21:04,506
Holy cow!

1275
01:21:04,506 --> 01:21:05,590
Good morning.

1276
01:21:05,590 --> 01:21:07,134
Are you alright?

1277
01:21:07,259 --> 01:21:08,760
That’s why she came back.

1278
01:21:08,844 --> 01:21:10,262
I knew you’d be back.

1279
01:21:10,262 --> 01:21:11,096
Woof, woof!

1280
01:21:11,263 --> 01:21:15,308
Is this place where you
come and go as you please?

1281
01:21:15,308 --> 01:21:16,893
Everyone’s been too distracted

1282
01:21:16,893 --> 01:21:18,562
to get any work done...

1283
01:21:22,274 --> 01:21:24,651
He’s just happy to see you,
you know that, right?

1284
01:21:26,361 --> 01:21:27,487
I’m sorry, sir.

1285
01:21:27,487 --> 01:21:28,655
If you’re sorry--

1286
01:21:28,738 --> 01:21:30,323
It’s enough that she’s sorry.

1287
01:21:30,323 --> 01:21:31,700
Let’s all get back to work.

1288
01:21:31,700 --> 01:21:32,659
Here’s an idea.

1289
01:21:32,659 --> 01:21:35,120
You be the team leader,
and I’ll be the deputy.

1290
01:21:35,704 --> 01:21:36,746
Sure.

1291
01:21:41,168 --> 01:21:43,253
So, what happened with the contest?

1292
01:21:43,253 --> 01:21:44,546
A total disaster.

1293
01:21:44,713 --> 01:21:47,799
At the very least, everyone there
will remember her name.

1294
01:21:47,799 --> 01:21:49,801
The nutjob who sent erotica
to a fairy tale contest.

1295
01:21:51,136 --> 01:21:53,430
But... somehow,

1296
01:21:54,890 --> 01:21:56,349
I feel relieved.

1297
01:21:57,142 --> 01:21:59,603
I always felt like I was being chased...

1298
01:22:00,353 --> 01:22:02,439
What about that publisher guy?

1299
01:22:02,439 --> 01:22:04,608
That’s completely over.

1300
01:22:04,733 --> 01:22:06,860
Everything gets filtered out.

1301
01:22:09,905 --> 01:22:11,281
Welcome!

1302
01:22:11,740 --> 01:22:12,949
Over here!

1303
01:22:14,785 --> 01:22:16,578
- Who is he?
- Who?

1304
01:22:16,995 --> 01:22:19,039
My personal editor, if you will.

1305
01:22:20,457 --> 01:22:22,083
The glass bottle?

1306
01:22:22,459 --> 01:22:24,961
I have so many questions...

1307
01:22:25,086 --> 01:22:27,464
Sure, ask anything you want.

1308
01:22:27,631 --> 01:22:29,216
What could you be curious about?

1309
01:22:29,216 --> 01:22:35,055
You review her stuff every night,
didn’t you have any reactions?

1310
01:22:35,263 --> 01:22:37,974
Well, it’s all part of the job for us.

1311
01:22:38,016 --> 01:22:39,017
Right...

1312
01:22:39,309 --> 01:22:41,770
Is Dan-bi not attractive
enough for you?

1313
01:22:41,853 --> 01:22:43,146
No, no, come on.

1314
01:22:43,188 --> 01:22:44,314
Then she is?

1315
01:22:44,856 --> 01:22:46,858
That’s why he’s here,
am I right?

1316
01:22:49,778 --> 01:22:50,737
One moment, sir!

1317
01:22:50,779 --> 01:22:52,656
- You picked the right one.
- Let’s sober up.

1318
01:22:52,656 --> 01:22:53,448
Taxi...

1319
01:22:53,782 --> 01:22:57,119
- Careful, careful!
- I got some to say!

1320
01:22:57,160 --> 01:22:58,495
- Careful!
- Dan-bi!

1321
01:22:58,495 --> 01:23:00,413
Hapjeong station,
then Ilsan please!

1322
01:23:00,580 --> 01:23:01,790
Have a safe ride home!

1323
01:23:02,249 --> 01:23:04,918
Make sure to use protection, okay?

1324
01:23:05,127 --> 01:23:06,837
I’m gonna kill you!

1325
01:23:06,962 --> 01:23:08,088
Take good care of Dan-bi!

1326
01:23:08,088 --> 01:23:09,548
- Condom, Condom!
- Okay!

1327
01:23:09,548 --> 01:23:10,549
Go!

1328
01:23:10,549 --> 01:23:11,466
Good night!

1329
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:14,010
Make sure to go to work
in the morning!

1330
01:23:16,721 --> 01:23:20,225
You must have felt awkward
because of my friends...

1331
01:23:20,350 --> 01:23:22,310
Not at all, it was fun.

1332
01:23:22,561 --> 01:23:24,604
Your friends seem really lively.

1333
01:23:26,565 --> 01:23:29,734
They’re mischievous,
but they’re not bad people.

1334
01:23:30,193 --> 01:23:31,111
Sure.

1335
01:23:33,196 --> 01:23:36,032
By the way,
can I ask you something?

1336
01:23:36,032 --> 01:23:36,908
Sure.

1337
01:23:37,325 --> 01:23:39,703
Between ‘Real Man’ and ‘Elevator’,

1338
01:23:41,037 --> 01:23:43,915
which one did you
honestly like better?

1339
01:23:45,250 --> 01:23:46,918
I liked both of them.

1340
01:23:47,169 --> 01:23:48,587
Come on, be honest.

1341
01:23:48,795 --> 01:23:50,547
Really, I liked both.

1342
01:23:52,632 --> 01:23:54,301
You like everything?

1343
01:23:54,384 --> 01:23:57,220
So that’s why you’re nice
to everyone, huh?

1344
01:23:57,637 --> 01:24:00,765
I’m not nice to just anyone.

1345
01:24:00,765 --> 01:24:01,766
Really?

1346
01:24:04,686 --> 01:24:06,897
So, you’re only nice to me?

1347
01:24:09,941 --> 01:24:11,151
It’s late, Dan-bi.

1348
01:24:11,276 --> 01:24:13,153
- Where are you going?
- It’s really late.

1349
01:24:13,236 --> 01:24:14,863
You’re only nice to me?

1350
01:24:14,946 --> 01:24:17,199
- So late.
- I didn’t know!

1351
01:24:18,116 --> 01:24:19,743
Let’s get going!

1352
01:24:21,745 --> 01:24:23,997
Where are you going?
Why are you running away?

1353
01:24:24,080 --> 01:24:25,749
It’s super late!

1354
01:24:36,259 --> 01:24:37,636
You scared me.

1355
01:24:37,803 --> 01:24:39,304
- Ms. Oh.
- Sir.

1356
01:24:39,346 --> 01:24:43,058
I read ‘The Secret Workout
of a Female Writer.’

1357
01:24:43,058 --> 01:24:43,975
Thank you.

1358
01:24:45,101 --> 01:24:46,478
I know it’s about me!

1359
01:24:46,561 --> 01:24:47,813
No, it’s not.

1360
01:24:49,022 --> 01:24:50,774
It is my story!

1361
01:24:56,238 --> 01:24:57,531
I said it’s not.

1362
01:25:00,075 --> 01:25:01,451
Remove the story!

1363
01:25:01,660 --> 01:25:05,539
If you don’t, I’ll report you.

1364
01:25:10,418 --> 01:25:11,962
How are you going to report me?

1365
01:25:12,629 --> 01:25:17,425
Other women know
those stories are about them.

1366
01:25:18,218 --> 01:25:21,054
But they just shut up
and get lost on their own.

1367
01:25:24,474 --> 01:25:26,017
You should get lost too.

1368
01:25:31,398 --> 01:25:36,319
If you ever get writer’s block,
let’s work out again.

1369
01:25:37,279 --> 01:25:38,530
Good luck.

1370
01:25:45,829 --> 01:25:47,914
Real Hunting Story

1371
01:25:48,623 --> 01:25:51,543
Wait, this feels wrong.

1372
01:26:11,354 --> 01:26:13,023
Please, read it once
all the way through.

1373
01:26:13,023 --> 01:26:15,192
How many times
do I have to tell you?

1374
01:26:15,192 --> 01:26:17,068
This isn’t a real piece of work!

1375
01:26:17,235 --> 01:26:20,322
This is garbage, you hear me?

1376
01:26:21,114 --> 01:26:22,449
Boss, please give me
one more chance.

1377
01:26:22,449 --> 01:26:24,409
Please, I beg you,
just one more chance!

1378
01:26:24,409 --> 01:26:25,494
Buddy!

1379
01:26:26,036 --> 01:26:28,914
If you don’t get consent
from women,

1380
01:26:28,914 --> 01:26:31,041
and post about a one-night stand!

1381
01:26:31,374 --> 01:26:34,127
That will completely destroy
their dignity...

1382
01:26:34,711 --> 01:26:36,880
That’s a crime, asshole,
it’s a crime!

1383
01:26:37,047 --> 01:26:40,217
Do you think adult literature
is some joke, huh?

1384
01:26:40,884 --> 01:26:43,595
You think it’s something
to be taken lightly?

1385
01:26:44,387 --> 01:26:45,680
Rewrite it!

1386
01:27:07,035 --> 01:27:12,791
Dan-bi, I’ve been waiting so long
for your call, I’m dying here.

1387
01:27:16,378 --> 01:27:17,212
Yoon Dan-bi

1388
01:27:19,756 --> 01:27:23,510
So impatient...

1389
01:27:25,053 --> 01:27:26,388
Who is this?

1390
01:27:31,351 --> 01:27:36,398
EroKing’s ‘Real Hunting Story’
has been #1 for 36 weeks...

1391
01:27:36,731 --> 01:27:39,401
He’s spreading online
that the female characters

1392
01:27:39,526 --> 01:27:42,863
in the story are real.

1393
01:27:43,738 --> 01:27:46,283
That’s probably the marketing angle...

1394
01:27:46,658 --> 01:27:50,996
He’s exploiting the fact that
it’s hard for the victims to report it.

1395
01:27:51,163 --> 01:27:53,707
Tough to come forward,
and even if they do...

1396
01:27:53,915 --> 01:27:56,460
it won’t be easy to prove...

1397
01:27:57,085 --> 01:28:00,338
Synopsis: The girl with a bag with
'The Adventures of Thomas' sticker...

1398
01:28:02,591 --> 01:28:04,342
That son of a bitch!

1399
01:28:20,233 --> 01:28:21,735
Mr. Hwang.

1400
01:28:22,652 --> 01:28:23,945
What brings you here?

1401
01:28:24,237 --> 01:28:27,574
What the hell did you do to Oh?

1402
01:28:28,909 --> 01:28:31,995
I’m working on my next piece,
wanna hear about it?

1403
01:28:32,454 --> 01:28:35,373
‘Ms. Y, who works to protect
youths from online porn,’

1404
01:28:35,540 --> 01:28:37,709
‘Leads a double life
as an erotica writer.’

1405
01:28:37,834 --> 01:28:39,836
‘A secret affair with her.’

1406
01:28:40,629 --> 01:28:44,382
It’s the kind of trashy story
people would love, no?

1407
01:28:48,595 --> 01:28:50,222
Choong-gil!

1408
01:28:53,016 --> 01:28:55,060
Isn’t it me you want?

1409
01:28:55,769 --> 01:28:58,230
So, leave others alone,
you bastard.

1410
01:28:59,981 --> 01:29:01,107
Please.

1411
01:29:01,566 --> 01:29:02,818
Please?

1412
01:29:03,109 --> 01:29:03,985
Yes.

1413
01:29:04,444 --> 01:29:08,615
Is that how someone begs?!

1414
01:29:08,615 --> 01:29:09,658
Goddammit...

1415
01:29:10,909 --> 01:29:15,622
Damn... 1986 Porsche 911...

1416
01:29:17,332 --> 01:29:18,834
At least get down on your knees.

1417
01:29:18,834 --> 01:29:19,793
Shit...

1418
01:29:20,085 --> 01:29:21,545
Freeze!

1419
01:29:25,090 --> 01:29:26,383
Mr. Hwang!

1420
01:29:26,883 --> 01:29:28,426
What are you doing?

1421
01:29:28,426 --> 01:29:30,178
Why are you on your knees?

1422
01:29:30,971 --> 01:29:32,055
Goddammit...

1423
01:29:32,097 --> 01:29:32,848
Are you crying?

1424
01:29:32,931 --> 01:29:33,807
What?

1425
01:29:34,266 --> 01:29:35,517
You cowardly bastard,

1426
01:29:35,642 --> 01:29:38,979
this car is his only pride,
you had to make him cry?

1427
01:29:39,146 --> 01:29:40,689
Hey, who’s crying? Me?

1428
01:29:40,689 --> 01:29:44,484
Is that what you want to do?
He’s almost 70!

1429
01:29:44,484 --> 01:29:45,986
I’m not that old yet.

1430
01:29:46,069 --> 01:29:48,280
Don’t you understand
what’s going on?

1431
01:29:48,947 --> 01:29:50,657
Do you want to ruin your life too?

1432
01:29:51,366 --> 01:29:54,369
Stop being so pathetic
and let’s settle this, you and me.

1433
01:29:55,120 --> 01:29:59,332
If I win, take down ‘Real Hunting Story’
and disappear forever.

1434
01:29:59,708 --> 01:30:00,750
Forever.

1435
01:30:02,752 --> 01:30:05,130
Why would I?
I have nothing to gain.

1436
01:30:05,714 --> 01:30:10,010
If I lose, I’ll sign with you.

1437
01:30:10,969 --> 01:30:12,053
Ms. Yoon.

1438
01:30:12,721 --> 01:30:14,389
What about my contract?

1439
01:30:15,891 --> 01:30:18,351
80-20, my favor.

1440
01:30:19,186 --> 01:30:19,895
Okay?

1441
01:30:19,895 --> 01:30:21,688
That is not okay, you bastard!

1442
01:30:21,688 --> 01:30:22,606
Okay!

1443
01:30:22,772 --> 01:30:23,940
What?

1444
01:30:34,618 --> 01:30:35,660
Let’s cheer her on.

1445
01:30:36,870 --> 01:30:37,996
Her body began to heat up again.

1446
01:30:37,996 --> 01:30:39,080
When she couldn’t hold her desire,

1447
01:30:39,080 --> 01:30:40,332
he finally came in.

1448
01:30:40,999 --> 01:30:42,918
Go, go, you’re doing so well!

1449
01:30:42,918 --> 01:30:44,961
Go, go! Good work!

1450
01:30:52,385 --> 01:30:54,679
And then he slowly approached her
and started taking off her clothes.

1451
01:31:04,606 --> 01:31:07,567
Dang, what was that?

1452
01:31:07,984 --> 01:31:09,069
Dementia?

1453
01:31:09,986 --> 01:31:11,446
Train of thought departed...

1454
01:31:38,682 --> 01:31:40,600
Forbidden Fairytale

1455
01:31:40,600 --> 01:31:42,686
Forbidden... Fairytale.

1456
01:31:43,186 --> 01:31:44,312
How is it?

1457
01:31:45,063 --> 01:31:48,024
You know fairy tales already
have sexual potential, right?

1458
01:31:48,650 --> 01:31:51,444
So, adapt them for adults.

1459
01:31:52,195 --> 01:31:56,283
Cinderella, The Little Mermaid,
characters from those fairy tales

1460
01:31:56,450 --> 01:31:57,951
doing naughty things.

1461
01:31:58,285 --> 01:31:59,703
It’s oddly arousing.

1462
01:31:59,995 --> 01:32:01,246
It’s freaking brilliant.

1463
01:32:01,538 --> 01:32:03,373
Okay, then how about this?

1464
01:32:03,373 --> 01:32:05,750
Cinderella has to go home
by midnight, right?

1465
01:32:05,876 --> 01:32:08,670
I never understood that,
why not just sleep with the prince?

1466
01:32:08,670 --> 01:32:10,088
- She can.
- Exactly.

1467
01:32:10,088 --> 01:32:13,133
They’re basically having
a one-night stand after the ball.

1468
01:32:13,300 --> 01:32:14,926
And if you meet a hottie
at the club,

1469
01:32:15,010 --> 01:32:16,511
you just leave because it’s midnight?

1470
01:32:16,511 --> 01:32:18,346
If the magic wears off?
She turns into a pauper.

1471
01:32:18,388 --> 01:32:19,681
She’s already naked,
so what does it matter?

1472
01:32:19,681 --> 01:32:21,892
The prince wouldn’t care
about that, right?

1473
01:32:22,642 --> 01:32:23,560
What?

1474
01:32:24,144 --> 01:32:25,353
Then how about this?

1475
01:32:25,353 --> 01:32:28,356
Snow White gets revived
by the prince

1476
01:32:28,356 --> 01:32:30,275
and is brought back to the castle.

1477
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:32,152
That’s where the fairy tale ends.

1478
01:32:32,486 --> 01:32:35,655
But my story shows
what happens afterward.

1479
01:32:38,074 --> 01:32:40,243
Afterward?

1480
01:32:40,452 --> 01:32:42,788
The story begins in the courtroom.

1481
01:32:43,121 --> 01:32:47,334
Snow White and the eldest dwarf
have an affair, so they’re on trial.

1482
01:32:47,501 --> 01:32:49,044
Kill them, kill them!

1483
01:32:49,795 --> 01:32:50,378
He’s so handsome!

1484
01:32:50,378 --> 01:32:51,379
So dreamy...

1485
01:32:51,505 --> 01:32:52,881
Hold on a second!

1486
01:32:53,215 --> 01:32:55,675
It’s true this guy liked me...

1487
01:32:55,759 --> 01:32:58,970
but I really wasn’t interested
in him at all!

1488
01:32:59,221 --> 01:33:02,641
I only have the prince!
Please believe me!

1489
01:33:03,642 --> 01:33:05,644
Buddy, tell them!

1490
01:33:07,312 --> 01:33:11,983
How could I ever forget the day
I learned about love?

1491
01:33:12,651 --> 01:33:14,402
What are you talking about?

1492
01:33:14,903 --> 01:33:18,323
The princess was happy
after coming to this castle.

1493
01:33:18,949 --> 01:33:24,204
I felt my job here was done,
so I packed my things to leave,

1494
01:33:24,830 --> 01:33:26,665
but then, a gust of wind
blew out the candle,

1495
01:33:26,665 --> 01:33:29,751
and suddenly, I was grabbed
from behind!

1496
01:33:29,751 --> 01:33:31,086
Oh my, oh my!

1497
01:33:31,211 --> 01:33:33,213
When did I ever do that?

1498
01:33:33,213 --> 01:33:39,427
They explored every inch of my body

1499
01:33:39,678 --> 01:33:43,431
with their tongue and hands,
as if they knew men so well,

1500
01:33:43,431 --> 01:33:45,308
and it felt too good to resist...

1501
01:33:45,433 --> 01:33:46,309
I did?

1502
01:33:46,768 --> 01:33:50,438
The tongue inside the mouth
is hot, right?

1503
01:33:50,605 --> 01:33:52,899
With that hot tongue, from my back...

1504
01:33:52,941 --> 01:33:55,152
licking like this,

1505
01:33:55,277 --> 01:33:57,988
downward, downward, continuously...

1506
01:33:58,238 --> 01:34:02,117
it grazed my chest,
sliding downwards...

1507
01:34:02,117 --> 01:34:08,123
until finally, it circled around
my belly button, one and a half times...

1508
01:34:08,290 --> 01:34:09,958
So embarrassing...

1509
01:34:10,208 --> 01:34:12,752
Then their hands slipped
into my pants!

1510
01:34:13,628 --> 01:34:15,547
And grabbed...

1511
01:34:16,590 --> 01:34:17,966
my...

1512
01:34:18,216 --> 01:34:20,010
- Your...
- Your...

1513
01:34:22,012 --> 01:34:23,555
- Pe...
- Pe-what?

1514
01:34:24,347 --> 01:34:25,640
Nis...

1515
01:34:26,266 --> 01:34:28,727
Shut up! When did I?!

1516
01:34:29,186 --> 01:34:31,062
- You shut up!
- You stay out of it!

1517
01:34:31,062 --> 01:34:32,689
Can’t we just kill her first?

1518
01:34:32,689 --> 01:34:34,191
Yeah, let him finish!

1519
01:34:34,316 --> 01:34:35,901
The one I love...

1520
01:34:37,611 --> 01:34:39,279
is not Snow White.

1521
01:34:39,321 --> 01:34:40,489
- What?
- Huh?

1522
01:34:44,075 --> 01:34:45,702
Please be happy.

1523
01:34:48,663 --> 01:34:49,790
I’ll head up first.

1524
01:34:54,044 --> 01:34:55,462
Brother, I’m here!

1525
01:34:55,754 --> 01:34:57,005
Brother!

1526
01:35:01,092 --> 01:35:02,427
Brother!

1527
01:35:03,053 --> 01:35:05,847
He’s handsome too,
both brothers are so hot!

1528
01:35:13,563 --> 01:35:16,775
So, the younger brother
framed him to get killed.

1529
01:35:17,067 --> 01:35:20,195
It’s like you twisted a mystery

1530
01:35:20,403 --> 01:35:22,697
with a gay element.

1531
01:35:24,616 --> 01:35:25,742
I want to read the next one.

1532
01:35:25,909 --> 01:35:26,785
You do?

1533
01:35:26,785 --> 01:35:31,498
A lot of women are into erotica,
so, the gay twist will work.

1534
01:35:31,748 --> 01:35:35,710
I wasn’t going hard on
the gay story, it’s a love story.

1535
01:35:35,877 --> 01:35:36,545
Love?

1536
01:35:36,545 --> 01:35:37,212
Yes.

1537
01:35:37,337 --> 01:35:40,924
You two have been together
a lot lately.

1538
01:35:40,924 --> 01:35:42,300
Sticky like glue.

1539
01:35:43,677 --> 01:35:46,930
What’s wrong with sticking together?

1540
01:35:54,521 --> 01:35:56,064
Oops, sorry.

1541
01:36:27,846 --> 01:36:28,847
What?

1542
01:36:33,185 --> 01:36:35,228
Fitness for Your Health

1543
01:36:36,521 --> 01:36:37,898
What is it?

1544
01:36:39,399 --> 01:36:40,275
Dan-bi!

1545
01:36:40,400 --> 01:36:41,401
Dan-bi?

1546
01:36:58,710 --> 01:37:01,129
What is wrong with me?

1547
01:37:31,326 --> 01:37:34,746
My #1 says hello...

1548
01:37:36,915 --> 01:37:38,500
I guess you’ve recovered.

1549
01:37:48,093 --> 01:37:50,345
Mr. Hwang!
Ms. Yoon’s piece is up!

1550
01:37:53,640 --> 01:37:56,309
“The Prince and the Seven Dwarfs”?

1551
01:37:56,977 --> 01:37:59,271
Watched without much expectation...
but wow. Super fun. LOL

1552
01:37:59,646 --> 01:38:02,107
Delivery, story, characters,
and twists-all top-notch

1553
01:38:04,151 --> 01:38:06,653
“The Prince and the Seven Dwarfs”?

1554
01:38:07,863 --> 01:38:09,823
So tacky, gosh...

1555
01:38:14,619 --> 01:38:15,829
Insane...

1556
01:38:16,204 --> 01:38:17,497
This is insane!

1557
01:38:17,706 --> 01:38:18,915
End of Episode 1

1558
01:38:19,082 --> 01:38:21,042
Next episode...

1559
01:38:22,085 --> 01:38:23,253
50 cents...

1560
01:38:25,714 --> 01:38:26,673
Look at that!

1561
01:38:26,673 --> 01:38:27,716
The Prince and the Seven Dwarfs

1562
01:38:27,716 --> 01:38:29,259
Dan-bi just hit a jackpot!

1563
01:38:29,468 --> 01:38:31,553
Rapid Rise in Popularity

1564
01:38:39,144 --> 01:38:41,146
To celebrate Dan-bi’s return,

1565
01:38:41,146 --> 01:38:43,607
and to commemorate
unity of our team,

1566
01:38:43,690 --> 01:38:45,525
let’s work hard, eat well,
and drink hard too!

1567
01:38:45,525 --> 01:38:47,861
After work, let’s have grilled eel--

1568
01:38:47,861 --> 01:38:52,324
Sir, something weird
got posted on the board.

1569
01:38:52,324 --> 01:38:54,367
If you don’t want to go,
just say so.

1570
01:38:54,367 --> 01:38:56,036
- It’s not that...
- What is it?

1571
01:38:57,204 --> 01:38:59,164
The double life of Ms. Yoon
from the Youth Protection team!

1572
01:38:59,247 --> 01:39:01,249
It says ‘Ms. Yoon,’
so, Yoon Dan-bi?

1573
01:39:01,958 --> 01:39:02,709
Pardon?

1574
01:39:02,793 --> 01:39:04,044
Take a look at this.

1575
01:39:04,127 --> 01:39:06,213
A weird claim was
posted on our board.

1576
01:39:09,591 --> 01:39:11,468
What’s this all about?

1577
01:39:17,224 --> 01:39:19,059
This is Youth Protection team.

1578
01:39:19,392 --> 01:39:20,477
Newspaper?

1579
01:39:21,228 --> 01:39:22,896
Ms. Yoon Dan-bi?

1580
01:39:23,021 --> 01:39:24,105
That hasn’t been confirmed yet...

1581
01:39:24,105 --> 01:39:25,774
Youth Protection team.

1582
01:39:26,024 --> 01:39:26,900
The bulletin board?

1583
01:39:27,108 --> 01:39:28,235
That’s not possible.

1584
01:39:29,110 --> 01:39:30,070
Hello?

1585
01:39:30,237 --> 01:39:32,906
Did you just swear at me?

1586
01:39:33,615 --> 01:39:35,534
I’m hanging up, you punk!

1587
01:39:35,534 --> 01:39:36,576
Dan-bi!

1588
01:39:36,576 --> 01:39:37,494
Hey!

1589
01:39:38,078 --> 01:39:40,080
Why aren’t they answering
your phone quickly?

1590
01:39:40,122 --> 01:39:41,832
Are you heading to EroKing?

1591
01:39:41,832 --> 01:39:42,374
Yes.

1592
01:39:42,374 --> 01:39:43,667
- I’ll come with you!
- Okay!

1593
01:39:43,667 --> 01:39:44,501
What?

1594
01:39:50,715 --> 01:39:53,718
Listen, I’ll go and talk
to that bastard myself,

1595
01:39:53,844 --> 01:39:55,971
so don’t get all worked up
and get caught up-

1596
01:39:56,054 --> 01:39:58,014
- Ms. Yoon! Hey!
- Dan-bi! Dammit!

1597
01:39:58,348 --> 01:39:59,683
Where are you going?!

1598
01:40:00,142 --> 01:40:01,184
Dan-bi!

1599
01:40:01,852 --> 01:40:03,019
He’s running away!

1600
01:40:03,186 --> 01:40:04,688
Where do you think you’re going?

1601
01:40:05,605 --> 01:40:08,275
EroKing, you punk!

1602
01:40:11,862 --> 01:40:13,071
Are you okay?!

1603
01:40:16,908 --> 01:40:18,201
Mr. Hwang!

1604
01:40:19,202 --> 01:40:20,454
Oh no...

1605
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:22,706
Shit, no airbag...

1606
01:40:22,706 --> 01:40:23,498
Sir, are you okay?

1607
01:40:23,498 --> 01:40:24,499
Are you hurt?

1608
01:40:24,791 --> 01:40:25,542
I got him at least.

1609
01:40:25,542 --> 01:40:26,293
Oh no...

1610
01:40:26,293 --> 01:40:27,669
Are you insane?!

1611
01:40:27,669 --> 01:40:30,255
You deserve it, you lowlife.

1612
01:40:31,047 --> 01:40:32,841
You’re all screwed now.

1613
01:40:33,300 --> 01:40:34,176
Shit...

1614
01:40:50,400 --> 01:40:51,610
Chicken shit.

1615
01:40:53,111 --> 01:40:55,030
What a moron!

1616
01:40:57,073 --> 01:40:58,658
You crazy bitch!

1617
01:40:58,784 --> 01:40:59,618
Hey!

1618
01:40:59,993 --> 01:41:01,912
You son of a bitch!

1619
01:41:08,585 --> 01:41:09,669
Dumbass.

1620
01:41:09,836 --> 01:41:10,545
Buddy!

1621
01:41:15,759 --> 01:41:17,677
Don’t look down on erotica.

1622
01:41:18,428 --> 01:41:20,514
Get your shit together, asshole.

1623
01:41:24,976 --> 01:41:26,937
The Secret Double Life of
a Harmful Content Regulator

1624
01:41:27,062 --> 01:41:28,688
Audit Committee Chairman

1625
01:41:28,772 --> 01:41:29,815
Mr. Han.

1626
01:41:29,940 --> 01:41:33,151
This is more than enough
for her dismissal.

1627
01:41:33,652 --> 01:41:35,278
What exactly is the problem?

1628
01:41:35,403 --> 01:41:37,364
Can’t a government employee
write a novel?

1629
01:41:37,531 --> 01:41:39,616
It depends on the type of novel.

1630
01:41:39,741 --> 01:41:42,077
How can a government official
write such trash...

1631
01:41:43,578 --> 01:41:45,580
Excuse me, I have a question.

1632
01:41:47,749 --> 01:41:51,670
Is it a problem to write
fairy tales after work?

1633
01:41:52,504 --> 01:41:54,172
No, and what of it?

1634
01:41:54,172 --> 01:41:58,552
Then why is writing erotica
after work a problem?

1635
01:41:58,635 --> 01:42:01,096
I already explained, didn’t I?

1636
01:42:01,096 --> 01:42:04,724
Writing such inappropriate content
tarnishes the honor of public servants,

1637
01:42:04,808 --> 01:42:07,018
and a reason for dismissal!

1638
01:42:07,018 --> 01:42:11,898
For humanity’s evolution and reproduction,
it’s adult romance that’s important,

1639
01:42:12,023 --> 01:42:14,359
not children’s books!

1640
01:42:14,442 --> 01:42:15,986
What the hell is he saying?

1641
01:42:15,986 --> 01:42:17,612
That’s a strange point.

1642
01:42:17,821 --> 01:42:20,907
What are the criteria for
a masterpiece and trash?

1643
01:42:20,907 --> 01:42:21,616
Could you two leave?

1644
01:42:21,616 --> 01:42:24,870
If it’s cathartic,
it’s a masterpiece,

1645
01:42:24,995 --> 01:42:25,829
and if it gets you wet, it’s trash?

1646
01:42:25,829 --> 01:42:27,414
Anyone outside?
Come in here!

1647
01:42:27,414 --> 01:42:29,374
- Escort them both out!
- Why me, too?

1648
01:42:29,374 --> 01:42:30,083
Don’t touch me!

1649
01:42:30,083 --> 01:42:34,421
How could you not know the basics
of evolution and reproduction?

1650
01:42:34,421 --> 01:42:36,089
Then should we ban
violent novels, too?

1651
01:42:36,089 --> 01:42:38,049
No novels with thieves
or scammers?!

1652
01:42:38,049 --> 01:42:38,967
Get out!

1653
01:42:38,967 --> 01:42:40,302
Should we ban novels
with scammers and thieves?!

1654
01:42:40,302 --> 01:42:41,261
Christ...

1655
01:42:41,428 --> 01:42:44,556
Then just ban all kinds of novels!

1656
01:42:47,392 --> 01:42:49,227
Ms. Yoon Dan-bi.

1657
01:42:50,020 --> 01:42:50,979
Yes, sir?

1658
01:42:51,396 --> 01:42:54,191
You know what you did wrong,
don’t you?

1659
01:42:54,941 --> 01:42:59,362
For your boss’ sake,
you’ll get a 3-month suspension,

1660
01:42:59,362 --> 01:43:00,864
so, stay quiet and
behave at home, okay?

1661
01:43:01,072 --> 01:43:03,074
This is your only chance.

1662
01:43:03,116 --> 01:43:06,328
Where do you get off, as a woman,
writing such indecent filth,

1663
01:43:06,328 --> 01:43:08,205
lowering the dignity of us all...

1664
01:43:09,623 --> 01:43:10,791
Mr. Chairman.

1665
01:43:11,374 --> 01:43:14,085
Before you talk about
the dignity of public servants,

1666
01:43:15,086 --> 01:43:18,423
you should consider
the basic integrity first.

1667
01:43:19,549 --> 01:43:20,467
I...

1668
01:43:22,594 --> 01:43:24,262
will resign.

1669
01:43:30,560 --> 01:43:31,812
Keep your emotions in check.

1670
01:43:31,812 --> 01:43:33,355
I said my piece.

1671
01:43:35,273 --> 01:43:36,149
Are you okay?

1672
01:43:36,149 --> 01:43:37,651
How did it go?

1673
01:43:37,651 --> 01:43:40,612
I’m done with this double life.

1674
01:43:40,821 --> 01:43:42,364
Then what will you do?

1675
01:43:42,614 --> 01:43:45,158
Well... something fun.

1676
01:43:45,283 --> 01:43:46,493
Dan-bi...

1677
01:43:46,993 --> 01:43:50,163
I’m gonna start doing
what I want to do,

1678
01:43:50,497 --> 01:43:52,290
and be honest to myself.

1679
01:44:25,073 --> 01:44:27,951
Oh Choong-gil, known as “EroKing,”
has been arrested on charges

1680
01:44:28,034 --> 01:44:30,495
of illegally filming women,

1681
01:44:30,495 --> 01:44:32,664
and all of his writings
have been taken down.

1682
01:45:24,758 --> 01:45:28,178
Park Ji-hyun

1683
01:45:28,678 --> 01:45:31,973
Choi Si-won

1684
01:45:32,682 --> 01:45:36,061
Sung Dong-il

1685
01:45:36,770 --> 01:45:40,106
Directed by Lee Jong-suk

1686
01:46:04,422 --> 01:46:05,173
What do you think?

1687
01:46:06,091 --> 01:46:09,803
What we want is... you know...

1688
01:46:10,971 --> 01:46:13,098
That sticky, sultry vibe.

1689
01:46:13,348 --> 01:46:15,225
That’s missing from this.

1690
01:46:15,392 --> 01:46:19,437
Then why don’t you teach me?
