00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,060
You are actually...

4
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,500
We meet again.

5
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:51,140
I'm the CEO of Qianyuan Technology,

6
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,420
Han Zaiyuan.

7
00:00:55,820 --> 00:00:56,860
This is my assistant,

8
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:57,860
Jiang Shiqian.

9
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,620
So Qianyuan means

10
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:06,460
Jiang Shiqian and Han Zaiyuan.

11
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:07,780
Exactly.

12
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:09,700
Our company

13
00:01:09,860 --> 00:01:11,540
is named after us.

14
00:01:11,950 --> 00:01:13,700
Do you really think your small company

15
00:01:13,730 --> 00:01:15,660
is qualified to cooperate with Lu Group?

16
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,420
I suggest you...

17
00:01:17,420 --> 00:01:18,260
Quiet down.

18
00:01:21,100 --> 00:01:21,940
Chengbei,

19
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,700
are you really considering cooperating
with them?

20
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,860
If President Lu is sincere,

21
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:28,020
let's start discussing cooperation now.

22
00:01:32,020 --> 00:01:33,460
Qianyuan Medical Technology,

23
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,780
founded in 2010,

24
00:01:35,180 --> 00:01:37,100
under the leadership of its founder
Han Zaiyuan,

25
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:38,700
has built a first-class research
and development,

26
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:40,380
technical service, and management team.

27
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,700
Our third-generation product

28
00:01:42,700 --> 00:01:44,500
can quickly detect a person's
physical condition

29
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:47,060
by linking to the nervous system.

30
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,940
To develop such high-tech medical equipment

31
00:01:50,020 --> 00:01:51,180
is indeed impressive.

32
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:53,900
Han Zaiyuan,

33
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,420
I underestimated you.

34
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,580
President Lu is too kind.

35
00:01:57,580 --> 00:01:58,420
Currently,

36
00:01:58,740 --> 00:02:00,300
Lu Group is the largest

37
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,900
medical equipment supply chain and

38
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:03,250
integrated service provider in the country.

39
00:02:03,250 --> 00:02:04,500
If Qianyuan

40
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,980
could cooperate with Lu Group,

41
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:07,540
it would be a win-win situation.

42
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:16,620
I am indeed very interested in your
medical equipment.

43
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:26,420
President Lu,

44
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:28,340
my wife and I

45
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,820
rarely visit Lu Group.

46
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,580
Can we have a tour?

47
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:33,100
Of course.

48
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,100
Come with me.

49
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,100
Let's go.

50
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:46,500
(Qianyuan Medical Technology)
President Lu,

51
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,500
how many units are you interested in ordering?

52
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:53,980
Can your company handle mass production?

53
00:02:54,460 --> 00:02:55,300
Certainly.

54
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:58,380
Our technology is already very mature.

55
00:03:26,620 --> 00:03:27,540
What's wrong?

56
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,340
It's nothing.

57
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:32,220
I'll go to the restroom.

58
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:37,380
Hello?

59
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:02,300
Shiqian,

60
00:04:04,300 --> 00:04:06,500
there's a mixer tonight. Do you want to come?

61
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:07,740
Forget it, you guys go have fun.

62
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,980
Have a good time.

63
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:11,940
Shiqian, why don't you come?

64
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,340
You've always been alone.

65
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,820
This is our last gathering before graduation.

66
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:17,740
Everyone will be there.

67
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,540
We really hope you'll come.

68
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:21,300
Alright,

69
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,860
I'll go then. See you tonight.

70
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:23,740
Okay, see you tonight.

71
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:25,060
See you later, bye.

72
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:31,580
Come on, show your card.

73
00:04:32,660 --> 00:04:34,700
You lost, drink this.

74
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,660
(When will it be over? I'll go pick you up?)

75
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:44,060
Shiqian, do you know how to play this?

76
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:44,900
Come play with us.

77
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,500
I don't know how. You guys play.

78
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,740
- Come on.
- Play with us.

79
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,420
Are you still mad at me

80
00:04:50,420 --> 00:04:51,700
for the incident

81
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:53,100
in the dance room last time?

82
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:54,820
No.

83
00:04:54,940 --> 00:04:55,980
Not at all.

84
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,820
It's good if you are not.

85
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:03,460
Come on, let's play together.

86
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:04,900
It is very simple.

87
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:06,820
Come on, give her a card.

88
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,700
Here we go.

89
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:10,860
Three, two, one.

90
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:12,700
You lost.

91
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:13,940
Drink this.

92
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:28,900
Three, two, one, compare.

93
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:32,750
Deal the cards.

94
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:35,440
Three, two, one, compare.

95
00:05:39,540 --> 00:05:41,140
You lost again. Here, drink this.

96
00:05:42,180 --> 00:05:43,220
It's me again?

97
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,740
Drink it, it's okay,

98
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:47,620
it's just wine.

99
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,700
Just this one glass.

100
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:49,940
I'll drink it for her.

101
00:05:53,020 --> 00:05:53,900
Lu Chengbei,

102
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:56,580
weren't you not coming?

103
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:57,860
I've changed my mind.

104
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,580
I'll go to the restroom.

105
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:35,180
I'll go to the restroom too.

106
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:38,540
Let's continue playing.

107
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,180
Continue, come on.

108
00:06:40,180 --> 00:06:41,020
You deal the cards.

109
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,420
Jiang Shiqian,

110
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:52,860
I want to see

111
00:06:53,180 --> 00:06:55,660
how the school beauty becomes

112
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:58,460
a laughingstock after getting drunk.

113
00:08:55,260 --> 00:08:56,140
What are you doing here?

114
00:08:57,180 --> 00:08:58,220
Are you okay?

115
00:08:58,420 --> 00:09:00,300
I'm fine.

116
00:09:02,140 --> 00:09:03,540
Why are you so nervous?

117
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,620
I'm fine.

118
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,580
Let go of me.

119
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,820
Jiang Shiqian,

120
00:09:07,660 --> 00:09:09,500
are you playing hard to get with me?

121
00:09:09,980 --> 00:09:11,500
You've come to me

122
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:13,220
but don't let me get close to you?

123
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,860
Let go of me.

124
00:09:18,290 --> 00:09:19,220
Jiang Shiqian,

125
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:20,900
don't forget,

126
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:23,700
I still have the gift you gave me.

127
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:30,860
You are awake.

128
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,340
Jiang Shiqian, I really like you.

129
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,100
Let go of me, let go.

130
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,780
Shiqian,

131
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:03,820
you have always liked me, right?

132
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,900
You haven't forgotten about me, right?

133
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,420
I'm telling you,

134
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:12,020
there hasn't been a day
I haven't thought of you.

135
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:14,380
You still like me,

136
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,340
you haven't forgotten about me, right?

137
00:10:16,540 --> 00:10:17,460
- Jiang Shiqian!
- Let go!

138
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,300
- Answer me!
- Let go!

139
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:21,180
Let go!
