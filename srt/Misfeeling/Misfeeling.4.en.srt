There hasn't been a day
I haven't thought of you.

00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:49,560
You still like me,

00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:51,520
you haven't forgotten about me, right?

- Let go!

00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:54,470

- Let go!

Let go!

Are you okay? It's fine now.

After all these years,

00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,400
I never expected you wouldn't change.

President Lu,

15
00:01:10,510 --> 00:01:11,590
I suppose our cooperation

16
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,870
doesn't need to continue.

17
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:15,150

00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:18,500
Let's go.

00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:30,950
you were frightened today.

00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:32,530
Rest well.

00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:35,070

have accidents again!

- Han Zaiyuan.

it's enough for you and that girl
for the rest of your life.

00:05:58,820 --> 00:06:00,220
This isn't about money.

Are you being too naive?

If it weren't for Jiang Shiqian seducing
Lu Chengbei first,

129
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:13,260
could he do such a thing?

130
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:15,300
She didn't. Don't slander Shiqian.

Alright, even if you sue,

132
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:20,860
do you have evidence?

she wasn't consenting?

Her body

137
00:06:29,900 --> 00:06:31,220
is the evidence.

138
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,140
I heard that

139
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:33,700
Jiang Shiqian took a shower

140
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,820
right after she got home.

141
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:38,300
She washed away everything.

142
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,980
What do you have to prove

143
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:42,020
she wasn't consenting?

144
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:43,660
Even if they really investigate,

145
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:47,500
it was Jiang Shiqian
who injured my son first.

146
00:06:47,620 --> 00:06:49,780
Then how do you account

147
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,220
for my son's hospital bill?

148
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,220
That brat has actually

149
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,820
become the CEO of Qianyuan.

150
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:06,380

152
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,580
otherwise, you'll be off

00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:10,700
from your CEO position.

Shiqian,

157
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,100
Lu Chengbei invited us to dinner,

158
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,020
saying he wants to apologize.

159
00:07:34,260 --> 00:07:36,020
- Should we go?
- Of course we should.

160
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:37,100
You founded Qianyuan

161
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,060
to counteract the Lu Group, right?

162
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,740
Are you ready?

163
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:44,180
Can't wait.

164
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,100
Jiang Shiqian,

165
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:07,660
we meet again.

166
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:09,420
Do you know each other?

167
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,180
President Lu,

168
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:13,300
Miss Jiang stayed at our hospital for a while.

169
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:14,580
She...

170
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,940
Let me introduce.

00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:20,420
Director of
Meng Private Rehabilitation Hospital.

173
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,420
I know him.

174
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:25,540
Director Meng gave me a new life.

175
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:27,020
New life?

176
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:28,390
Yes.

177
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,220
Since we're all gathered here today,

178
00:08:30,260 --> 00:08:32,060
it's a fresh start.

179
00:08:32,180 --> 00:08:33,740
Here, let me toast you.

180
00:08:44,260 --> 00:08:45,300
What are you doing?

181
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:47,060
Since it's a fresh start,

182
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,580
let's bid farewell to the past.

183
00:08:48,940 --> 00:08:50,060
In my eyes,

184
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,100
you're already dead.

185
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:54,460
You...

186
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,020
How dare you hit me!

187
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:59,980
Miss Meng, please understand the situation.

188
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:01,260
Right now, your Lu Group

189
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,020
is begging to cooperate with Qianyuan.

190
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,780
Don't go crazy.

191
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:12,500
Today's dinner

192
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:14,700
is to facilitate the tripartite cooperation

193
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:15,780
between Lu Group,

194
00:09:15,780 --> 00:09:17,300
Qianyuan, and Meng Private Hospital.

195
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,940
Your Qianyuan equipment

196
00:09:19,290 --> 00:09:20,500
will be used

197
00:09:21,020 --> 00:09:23,060
in Meng Private Hospital.

198
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:25,540
I wonder how Ms. Jiang feels

199
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,700
about this.

200
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,220
Our products are

201
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:32,300
specifically designed for psychiatry.

202
00:09:32,860 --> 00:09:34,220
They suit your hospital very well.

203
00:09:35,180 --> 00:09:36,100
Xunmei,

204
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:37,900
go change your clothes.

205
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,660
- Dad!
- Xunmei.

206
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:51,780
President Han, Ms. Jiang,

207
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,980
please take a seat first.

208
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:00,260
President Han, just now,

209
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,660
my daughter lost her composure a bit.

210
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:05,500
I think there must be some misunderstanding
with Ms. Jiang.

211
00:10:05,620 --> 00:10:06,620
Hope you don't mind.

212
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:08,780
As the largest private hospital in the city,

213
00:10:08,820 --> 00:10:11,420
we trust Qianyuan's equipment greatly.

214
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:14,020
Hope we can further deepen our cooperation

215
00:10:14,020 --> 00:10:14,860
in the future.

216
00:10:14,860 --> 00:10:15,700
Sure.

217
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,940
Here's to our cooperation going

218
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,060
smoothly.

219
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:28,300
Cooperation,

220
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:30,140
it's about being at ease.

221
00:10:30,300 --> 00:10:31,260
Director Meng,

222
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:34,220
can I go to the hospital?

223
00:10:37,780 --> 00:10:38,740
Of course,

224
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,500
you're welcome anytime.

225
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:45,940
Alright, let's eat something.

226
00:11:09,500 --> 00:11:10,460
For the rest of your life,

227
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:12,660
just enjoy yourself here.

228
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:18,740
Lu Chengbei is the heir I supported.

229
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:20,940
I won't let you ruin him.

230
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:38,280
All of you

231
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:41,140
should go to hell.
