3
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Next time,

4
00:00:46,390 --> 00:00:48,920
it won't be just a dress.

5
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:53,640
Happy engagement.

6
00:00:59,380 --> 00:01:00,600
Lu Chengbei,

7
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:04,430
you saw it too, Jiang Shiqian was too much.

8
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,710
You don't still have feelings for her, do you?

9
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:21,590
I have some things to attend to.

10
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,040
Jiang Shiqian.

11
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,430
Have you been unable to

12
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:35,000
forget about me all these years?

13
00:01:35,710 --> 00:01:37,040
Indeed, I can't forget about you.

14
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:38,350
But I'm already engaged.

15
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:39,350
I'm married.

16
00:01:51,310 --> 00:01:52,710
Han Zaiyuan?

17
00:01:53,150 --> 00:01:54,310
Let me introduce you.

18
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:55,560
This is my husband,

19
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:57,310
you know him, Han Zaiyuan.

20
00:01:57,430 --> 00:01:59,560
So, your brother has become

21
00:01:59,710 --> 00:02:01,310
your husband after all these years.

22
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,510
Nice to meet you.

23
00:02:08,590 --> 00:02:09,430
Let's go.

24
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:18,500
(Modern Creative Media College)

25
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:28,310
Where are you going? Let me drive you.

26
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,680
No need.

27
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,960
- Shiqian.
- Brother.

28
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,240
Hop on.

29
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:38,200
Let's go.

30
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,400
Who's that guy?

31
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:54,750
Han Zaiyuan.

32
00:02:55,710 --> 00:02:57,560
He's a student sponsored by
Jiang Shiqian's parents,

33
00:02:58,240 --> 00:02:59,520
like her brother.

34
00:02:59,710 --> 00:03:01,750
They come to school and go home together
every day.

35
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:03,000
They live together?

36
00:03:03,030 --> 00:03:04,450
Jiang Shiqian doesn't stay in the dormitory?

37
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,750
After her parents passed away,

38
00:03:05,750 --> 00:03:07,240
they've been living together.

39
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,430
Ridiculous, huh?

40
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:11,560
Isn't that just cohabitation?

41
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,400
Do you really think Jiang Shiqian is flower?

42
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:16,360
Maybe she's messy.

43
00:03:16,430 --> 00:03:17,430
Shut up.

44
00:03:24,310 --> 00:03:25,150
(Shiqian,)

45
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:28,240
(thank you for letting me be your brother.)

46
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:30,630
(No matter what lies ahead,)

47
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,910
(I'll always be by your side.)

48
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:38,190
Mom,

49
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:39,590
Dad,

50
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:42,300
today is your memorial day.

51
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:45,180
I hope you are all well up there.

52
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:48,300
I've been admitted to the college where
Brother is studying,

53
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:50,700
and I've also received a scholarship.

54
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:53,220
My classmates and teachers

55
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,760
have been very kind to me.

56
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:58,780
Don't worry.

57
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:00,660
Mr. and Mrs. Jiang,

58
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:02,780
I'll take good care of Shiqian.

59
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:05,300
I won't let her get hurt at all.

60
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,180
Don't worry.

61
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,300
I'll do my best

62
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,340
to give Shiqian a good life.

63
00:04:12,250 --> 00:04:13,700
I'll be with her for the rest of my life.

64
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:16,620
You used to say

65
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:18,660
the name of this cactus

66
00:04:18,740 --> 00:04:20,020
is Aurora.

67
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,940
It represents that

68
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:24,100
even if the night is long,

69
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,940
there will always be auroras,

70
00:04:26,300 --> 00:04:29,100
like dawn lighting up the darkness.

71
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,060
Jiang Shiqian!

72
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,460
So you two really live together.

73
00:04:42,630 --> 00:04:43,800
Han Zaiyuan,

74
00:04:43,940 --> 00:04:46,180
you're just a dog raised by the Jiang family.

75
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,620
Now that your owner is dead,

76
00:04:47,700 --> 00:04:48,740
why are you still here?

77
00:04:48,740 --> 00:04:49,820
Lu Chengbei, shut up.

78
00:04:51,140 --> 00:04:52,940
Mr. and Mrs. Jiang are like my own parents.

79
00:04:52,940 --> 00:04:54,220
You can insult me,

80
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:56,260
but don't be disrespectful on their
memorial day,

81
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:57,450
and this is a matter for the Jiang family,

82
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,180
none of your business.

83
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,540
What if I must interfere?

84
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:01,700
Brother.

85
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:03,180
Brother.

86
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:04,140
Are you okay, Brother?

87
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,230
Do you know this could ruin her reputation?

88
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,340
That's enough, Lu Chengbei.

89
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,730
Who I live with

90
00:05:11,790 --> 00:05:12,900
has nothing to do with you.

91
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:14,340
Don't show up in front of me again.

92
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,460
I won't like you.

93
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:16,900
I will never like you.

94
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:31,820
Are you okay?

95
00:05:36,620 --> 00:05:38,080
Brother, are you okay?

96
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,180
Does it hurt?

97
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:41,340
I'm fine.

98
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,380
Shiqian,

99
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:46,800
Lu Chengbei has been bothering you?

100
00:05:46,810 --> 00:05:47,810
Why didn't you tell me?

101
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:49,200
I'm fine, Brother.

102
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:50,540
You don't need to worry.

103
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,400
I just want to focus on my studies.

104
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,460
Do you mind us living together?

105
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:57,380
What?

106
00:05:58,890 --> 00:06:00,230
Just now, Lu Chengbei said

107
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:02,630
it would ruin your reputation.

108
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,140
Indeed, we're not related by blood,

109
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,340
but we live together.

110
00:06:13,340 --> 00:06:14,380
I really

111
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:16,980
just want to take care of you.

112
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,020
But I didn't consider that

113
00:06:19,140 --> 00:06:20,500
it would affect you.

114
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,540
Brother, please don't say that.

115
00:06:23,860 --> 00:06:25,380
We're already family.

116
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,220
I just

117
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:29,220
need a quiet study environment,

118
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,260
and the house isn't far from school,

119
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:32,340
very convenient.

120
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,580
Most importantly,

121
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,020
you're here, Brother.

I only see you as my brother.

152
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,500
I'm done showering.

153
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:58,900
- Shiqian.
- Yeah?

154
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,700
When you met Lu Chengbei and
Meng Xunmei today,

155
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:01,540
how was it?

156
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:04,540
I've been waiting

157
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,580
for this day for a long time.

158
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,060
Should I help you with this?

159
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:09,700
I'm afraid you'll get hurt again.

160
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,540
No,

161
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:13,540
I want to handle this personally.

162
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,060
Okay,

163
00:08:15,820 --> 00:08:16,980
I'll accompany you.

164
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:19,500
I'll make sure they pay the price they deserve.

165
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:20,340
Brother,

166
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,660
you don't need to accompany me.

167
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:23,980
I don't want to trouble you.

168
00:08:26,900 --> 00:08:28,820
You've already been good enough to me.

169
00:08:28,990 --> 00:08:30,630
You've given me a stable home.

170
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,570
If Mom and Dad in heaven could see this,

171
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:35,020
they'd be grateful to you.

172
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:36,660
