3
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:13,870
(Lu Chengbei,)

4
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:15,870
(Meng Xunmei,)

5
00:01:16,120 --> 00:01:17,840
(do you know how important)

6
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:19,450
(Engagement: Lu Chengbei &amp; Meng Xunmei)
(you are to me?)

7
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,480
(My hatred towards you)

8
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,510
(was never buried.)

9
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:27,680
(Even if the truth is destroyed,)

10
00:01:29,480 --> 00:01:31,400
(it is destined to resurface,)

11
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:36,200
(like a phoenix reborn)

12
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:41,070
(from the ashes.)

13
00:02:07,480 --> 00:02:09,120
Why hasn't the banquet started yet?

14
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,360
Who are you?

15
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,400
Can't you tell who I am?

16
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:14,750
I'm the bride.

17
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,030
You're the bride?

18
00:02:16,030 --> 00:02:17,630
Then who is the one in the banquet hall?

19
00:02:20,240 --> 00:02:21,800
(Where have you been all these years?)

20
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,870
(Don't you know?)

21
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:27,120
(My disappearance)

22
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:29,800
(was all for this return.)

23
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:33,190
(Am I dreaming?)

24
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:36,470
(I can actually touch you again.)

25
00:02:38,470 --> 00:02:39,910
(Your warmth)

26
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,590
(is so real.)

27
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:44,190
(Lu Chengbei,)

28
00:02:45,310 --> 00:02:46,750
(welcome to my hell.)

29
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,800
(This)

30
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:52,710
(is just the beginning.)

31
00:03:07,470 --> 00:03:09,710
Who are you? Why are you here?

32
00:03:12,910 --> 00:03:14,030
Jiang Shiqian?

33
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,630
Long time no see,

34
00:03:17,630 --> 00:03:18,710
old classmate.

35
00:03:19,150 --> 00:03:20,590
I told you to leave!

36
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:21,870
Hurry up and go out.

37
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,280
- Let's go, let's go.
- Hurry up, can't you hear me?

38
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,750
Move.

39
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:03,620
(Before meeting you,
the world was desolate.)

40
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:06,560
Childish.

41
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:15,590
This is for you.

42
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:16,950
Thank you, I don't need it.

43
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:19,240
I, Lu Chengbei, never take back

44
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:21,000
a gift I give away.

45
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:26,560
Since it's a gift to me,

46
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,480
then it's mine now.

47
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,920
Can I dispose of it as I please?

48
00:04:30,310 --> 00:04:31,150
Of course.

49
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:52,120
(Lu Chengbei,)

50
00:04:52,390 --> 00:04:54,360
(you actually like this type.)

51
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:19,000
You dance really well.

52
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,600
No wonder boys at school

53
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,000
are chasing after you.

54
00:05:25,070 --> 00:05:26,190
Do you have something to say?

55
00:05:29,630 --> 00:05:32,240
This place is indeed a nice place to dance.

56
00:05:32,510 --> 00:05:34,390
But didn't the teacher tell you?

57
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,600
This place now

58
00:05:39,270 --> 00:05:40,870
is my changing room.

59
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:42,920
Well then, I'll find another place.

60
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,230
Hold on.

61
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,600
Did I say you could leave?

62
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:50,070
Firstly, this is a public classroom.

63
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:51,310
I have the right to use it.

64
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,390
Secondly, you say this classroom

65
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:54,720
is already your changing room,

66
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,630
but talk is cheap.

67
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:56,920
I'll confirm with the teacher.

68
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:03,310
My family donates at least ten million

69
00:06:03,310 --> 00:06:04,800
to this school every year.

70
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,630
Your scholarship comes from that.

71
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,480
Shouldn't you be grateful to me?

72
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
You think the teacher would favor you?

73
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,270
Who's there?

74
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,830
So noisy.

75
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:23,270
Lu Chengbei.

76
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:24,830
What are you doing here?

77
00:06:24,870 --> 00:06:25,720
What's wrong?

78
00:06:26,070 --> 00:06:27,070
Can't I rest

79
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,000
in a public place.

80
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:30,040
I don't mean that.

81
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:32,630
This place

82
00:06:32,870 --> 00:06:35,310
is indeed suitable as a changing room.

83
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:42,120
But she used my changing room.

84
00:06:42,310 --> 00:06:44,270
Shouldn't we give her some

85
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,390
punishment?

86
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:52,150
Of course.

87
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,630
You decide the punishment.

88
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:08,360
Beg me, and I'll help you.

89
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,720
No need.

90
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,720
Do you remember how you

91
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,510
treated me back then?

92
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,640
Jiang Shiqian,

93
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,000
I admit I was young and foolish,

94
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:52,430
but now it's mine and Chengbei's
engagement banquet.

95
00:07:52,630 --> 00:07:54,160
Don't think about causing trouble,

96
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:55,750
otherwise,

97
00:07:56,600 --> 00:07:57,950
I won't let you off.

98
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,240
The past is gone,

99
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:01,360
but some things can't be let go.

100
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,040
You want to let me off,

101
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:05,040
but I'm not ready to let you off.

102
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,390
What are you up to?

103
00:08:12,630 --> 00:08:13,600
Meng Xunmei,

104
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:15,270
don't you think your life

105
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:17,120
is like this evening dress?

106
00:08:17,430 --> 00:08:18,870
Looks glamorous,

107
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,920
but it's actually covered in bugs.

108
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,240
Let me help you kill

109
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,430
all those bugs.

110
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,480
Okay?

111
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:33,270
My dress!

112
00:08:33,910 --> 00:08:35,270
This is a limited edition.

113
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,750
There's only one in the world.

114
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,240
Next time,

115
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,030
it won't be just a dress.

116
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,390
Happy engagement.
