1
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,399
Search them!

2
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:29,039
Yes, sir.

3
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,759
Who are you?

4
00:00:37,359 --> 00:00:38,399
How dare you

5
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:40,159
break into my house?

6
00:00:40,679 --> 00:00:41,159
My Lord,

7
00:00:41,439 --> 00:00:43,159
what's going on here?

8
00:00:46,479 --> 00:00:47,679
Marquis Wei Yuan,

9
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:48,960
Fan Xingxu,

10
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,560
I have no grudges

11
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:54,600
with the Wei Yuan family.

12
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:56,119
What have I done

13
00:00:56,439 --> 00:00:58,600
that you'd personally lead troops

14
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,039
and break into

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,000
my residence at night?

16
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,319
Marquis Wei Yuan,

17
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:07,640
what's your intention?

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:08,319
My Lord,

19
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:09,959
the carriage has been found,

20
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,159
with bloodstains on it.

21
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:14,959
The culprit

22
00:01:16,319 --> 00:01:19,680
who caused the fatal accident on Changning Street

23
00:01:20,719 --> 00:01:22,280
to come out and confess.

24
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,280
Otherwise,

25
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:26,400
I'll make the whole Shen family pay.

26
00:01:27,959 --> 00:01:29,280
I'll count to three.

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:31,480
Three.

28
00:01:31,959 --> 00:01:32,640
Prince Wu'an,

29
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,560
you can't wrong the innocent.

30
00:01:34,879 --> 00:01:35,920
My lord has been revising the law.

31
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:38,319
We haven't left home for a day.

32
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:40,840
Two.

33
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:42,319
Fan Xingxu, you...

34
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,400
One...

35
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:47,879
It's me.

36
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:55,680
Yuan Zhi

37
00:01:56,439 --> 00:01:57,480
Something happened, Yuan Zhi.

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,040
You have to save me.

39
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:01,040
Today after i brought you to White Horse Temple

40
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:01,640
and returned by carriage,

41
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:02,480
I accidentally...

42
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,319
ran over someone.

43
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,319
I wanted to save her,

44
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,159
but she died right there.

45
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:07,879
Hit...

46
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:10,120
...killed someone?

47
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,479
Yuan Zhi, we've been childhood sweethearts,

48
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,240
and we've already promised to marry each other.

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,960
I finally got a chance to take the imperial exam.

50
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:21,599
If I'm involved in a murder, I'll be ruined.

51
00:02:21,759 --> 00:02:23,120
But you're different.

52
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,759
You're the Di daughter of the Minister of Revenue.

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,439
I'm just a follwer

54
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:27,719
you kept at home.

55
00:02:27,919 --> 00:02:29,840
Just say...say that you...

56
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,000
you rode the horses recklessly

57
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,639
and killed someone.

58
00:02:33,919 --> 00:02:34,240
I...

59
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,319
I...

60
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,759
Mr. Shen will definitely save you.

61
00:02:37,960 --> 00:02:38,719
My Lady.

62
00:02:40,479 --> 00:02:41,080
My Lady.

63
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:42,479
Miss, bad news!

64
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:44,039
The residence is surrounded!

65
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,360
Dingding,

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,120
go find someone right away.

67
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:52,319
Yes.

68
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:52,719
Okay.

69
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,000
Say it again.

70
00:03:02,479 --> 00:03:03,319
What are you doing?

71
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:10,039
Say it again!

72
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,919
I killed him.

73
00:03:15,199 --> 00:03:15,759
Today,

74
00:03:16,199 --> 00:03:17,599
I sneaked out to play.

75
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,479
When I came back,

76
00:03:19,919 --> 00:03:20,800
the horse got out of control.

77
00:03:21,439 --> 00:03:21,759
I...

78
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,360
I didn't have time to control it.

79
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,439
Anyway,

80
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,280
it's all my fault.

81
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:28,159
I'll take the blame for it.

82
00:03:29,639 --> 00:03:30,919
It has nothing to do with others.

83
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:32,759
Sneak...

84
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,240
...out...

85
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:33,639
...ride...

86
00:03:33,639 --> 00:03:34,240
...recklessly.

87
00:03:38,599 --> 00:03:39,120
Stop!

88
00:03:40,479 --> 00:03:41,360
My lady.

89
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:45,719
I received a report that

90
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,080
a carriage from the Ministry

91
00:03:48,280 --> 00:03:49,400
caused a fatality today.

92
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,919
I didn't expect you to be here.

93
00:03:53,199 --> 00:03:55,360
This is Shen Yuanzhi's confession

94
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,080
delivered to the court.

95
00:03:57,759 --> 00:03:59,159
She has confessed and accepted punishment.

96
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,599
According to the laws of the Great Yan,

97
00:04:02,039 --> 00:04:03,120
accidental death

98
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,719
of a sixth-rank official's family member

99
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:07,080
with a confession

100
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:08,840
merits 20 strokes of the cane.

101
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,479
All I know is

102
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,439
pay your debts,

103
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:14,599
and pay with your life for murder.

104
00:04:15,719 --> 00:04:16,920
Prince Wei Yuan,

105
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,079
you're willing to abuse your power

106
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,160
and risk defying the law

107
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:24,120
to kill me.

108
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,480
May I ask

109
00:04:27,279 --> 00:04:28,040
what's the relationship

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:30,000
between you and the woman

111
00:04:30,439 --> 00:04:32,120
I killed today?

112
00:04:33,079 --> 00:04:33,560
Marquis Wei Yuan,

113
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,120
are you fighting for the people

114
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:39,079
or seeking personal revenge?

115
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,079
What's our relationship?

116
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,120
None of your business.

117
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:46,079
You only need to know

118
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:47,519
that today,

119
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:50,240
you must die.

120
00:04:51,480 --> 00:04:52,000
Prince Wei Yuan,

121
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:52,639
what are you doing?

122
00:05:07,279 --> 00:05:08,560
Is it like this

123
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,800
that's enough?

124
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:12,680
Yuan Zhi,

125
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:19,720
My daughter!

126
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:21,560
Fan Xingxu,

127
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:23,639
if my daughter dies today,

128
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:25,319
I'll definitely tell Your Majesty about you.

129
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,920
You'll pay for it.

130
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,720
Call the doctor!

131
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:32,519
Retreat!

132
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:39,680
What a pity.

133
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:41,399
It's just one step away.

134
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:42,439
Prince Wei Yuan,

135
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,439
why didn't he kill that bitch?

136
00:05:45,399 --> 00:05:46,160
No pity!

137
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,040
Now,

138
00:05:49,959 --> 00:05:51,319
she's got a murder on her conscience.

139
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,079
Even the lowest scum

140
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:56,839
wouldn't marry her.

141
00:05:57,639 --> 00:05:58,959
No one would.

142
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:00,959
If it weren't for Lord Yan's protection,

143
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:02,759
why bother

144
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,959
making you play along

145
00:06:03,959 --> 00:06:05,240
with her every day?

146
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:08,000
Once that old man dies,

147
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:11,680
the entire Shen's Mansion will be ours.

148
00:06:17,839 --> 00:06:18,680
What?

149
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:20,360
Who is it?

150
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:27,319
Thankfully,

151
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:28,519
the injury isn't severe.

152
00:06:29,519 --> 00:06:31,360
Otherwise, you would have lost your life.

153
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,000
Is it worth it

154
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,279
for Mr. Gu?

155
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,160
According to the law,

156
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:40,279
I'll only receive 20 strokes.

157
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:42,040
This proves

158
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:43,600
the deceased

159
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:45,279
was just a commoner.

160
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,120
But the Marquis Wei Yuan is acting aggressively,

161
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:50,399
which suggests

162
00:06:51,079 --> 00:06:53,000
he has a complicated relationship with her.

163
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,319
If I hadn't killed her,

164
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:56,319
he would have killed me.

165
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,519
But My Lady,

166
00:06:58,519 --> 00:06:59,959
he looks so fierce.

167
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:02,160
What if he comes again?

168
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,399
No matter how powerful the Wei Yuan Marquisate is,

169
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,079
they broke into the residence

170
00:07:07,079 --> 00:07:08,519
of an official without the consent

171
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:10,199
of the Prefect of the Capital.

172
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,480
They clearly showed no respect

173
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:13,279
for the Prefect.

174
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:15,360
No one could bear it.

175
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,480
So,

176
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,480
for his authority,

177
00:07:19,839 --> 00:07:21,600
The Provincial Governor will protect me.

178
00:07:22,399 --> 00:07:23,079
Don't worry.

179
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,000
I deliberately

180
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,279
avoided all the vital organs and meridians.

181
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,680
I won't die.

182
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,920
Just take care of yourself for a while.

183
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:30,279
OK.

184
00:07:32,519 --> 00:07:33,319
By the way, Dingding,

185
00:07:34,439 --> 00:07:35,680
please help me to investigate

186
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:37,399
the situation of that girl's family.

187
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,480
Since I've acknowledged it,

188
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,040
I owe her.

189
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,759
Even if I go to the underworld

190
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:47,720
and descend to the 18th layer of hell,

191
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:49,720
I won't regret it.

192
00:07:52,480 --> 00:07:53,480
Assassins!

193
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:54,600
You!

194
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:56,519
My lady!

195
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:57,399
My lady!

196
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,279
Assassins!

197
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,319
You...

198
00:08:10,519 --> 00:08:11,639
Abducting the Minister's daughter?

199
00:08:12,279 --> 00:08:13,480
Marquis Weiyuan, are you insane?

200
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:14,839
Aren't you curious

201
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,680
about who you killed?

202
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:19,759
I promised her to wait for me for three years,

203
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:22,920
and I'd marry her when I returned from the battlefield.

204
00:08:25,399 --> 00:08:26,680
But because of you,

205
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,240
I broke my promise.

206
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:29,040
I'm sorry.

207
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:32,559
Ah.

208
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,720
I understand your pain.

209
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,440
It's already happened.

210
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,200
Even if you kill me,

211
00:08:40,759 --> 00:08:42,480
your beloved won't come back to life.

212
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:54,000
Does it hurt?

213
00:08:57,039 --> 00:08:58,559
It didn't touch the meridians

214
00:08:59,039 --> 00:09:00,399
or injure the organs.

215
00:09:00,799 --> 00:09:02,039
How much can it hurt?

216
00:09:10,799 --> 00:09:13,600
You'll never understand my pain.

217
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,320
Since you've heard it,

218
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:19,039
there's nothing left to say.

219
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:21,039
I just hope you don't act rashly.

220
00:09:21,679 --> 00:09:23,000
Killing won't solve anything.

221
00:09:30,679 --> 00:09:31,799
I won't kill you.

222
00:09:32,679 --> 00:09:34,080
When a person dies,

223
00:09:34,559 --> 00:09:36,600
there's only a few seconds of pain.

224
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,960
But how can someone as hypocritical and selfish as you

225
00:09:39,759 --> 00:09:41,799
die so easily?

226
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:44,200
What are you going to do?

227
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:47,720
Ah.

228
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,840
May you taste all worldly pain.

229
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,519
Heartbreaking,

230
00:10:02,759 --> 00:10:04,879
yet worse than death.

231
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:14,759
I didn't expect

232
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,440
the Marquis, who never gets close to women,

233
00:10:16,639 --> 00:10:18,159
to hide a woman in his room.

234
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:18,799
Ah.

235
00:10:18,960 --> 00:10:20,320
You don't understand.

236
00:10:20,679 --> 00:10:21,840
As long as you're a man,

237
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:23,759
you can't escape lust.

238
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:26,600
Princess Nine chases after the Marquis every day.

239
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:28,120
he didn't even take a second glance.

240
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:30,279
I'll bet half my salary

241
00:10:30,799 --> 00:10:31,799
that this woman

242
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,159
is a stunning beauty.

243
00:10:34,159 --> 00:10:34,919
Our Marquis...

244
00:10:35,039 --> 00:10:35,799
Oh,

245
00:10:35,799 --> 00:10:38,480
if only I had such good fortune.

246
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,399
Dying under the peony,

247
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,360
even as a ghost, one remains charming.

248
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:43,159
Hey,

249
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:44,679
What are you talking about?

250
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,000
How could my brother hide a mistress?

251
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:48,759
Princess.

252
00:11:02,679 --> 00:11:04,000
I have to find a way out.

253
00:11:11,559 --> 00:11:12,440
Oh, no. Go after him.

254
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:19,960
Where is he?

255
00:11:20,559 --> 00:11:21,559
Marquis Wei Yuan.

256
00:11:25,399 --> 00:11:26,039
Who are you?

257
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,600
I'm also acting on orders.

258
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,080
Now, be a good girl for me...

259
00:11:36,639 --> 00:11:38,200
Today, I'm going to have my way with you!

260
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:38,919
Let me go.

261
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:40,720
So fragrant...

262
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:08,080
Hawkeye,

263
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,519
dispose of this.

264
00:12:12,879 --> 00:12:13,279
Yes.

265
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,039
Wait.

266
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,120
You said

267
00:12:28,879 --> 00:12:31,240
you'd make me suffer all pain

268
00:12:31,559 --> 00:12:32,679
cutting my heart,

269
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:34,759
and making me feel like dying.

270
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,240
Is this the despicable way?

271
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:40,120
It's up to you

272
00:12:40,759 --> 00:12:41,320
to think about it.

273
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:42,759
Pah!

274
00:12:43,720 --> 00:12:45,000
You're a piece of shit!

275
00:12:45,559 --> 00:12:46,840
I despise you!

276
00:12:53,919 --> 00:12:55,519
You killed my servant!

277
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,200
You tied me up first.

278
00:12:57,799 --> 00:12:59,080
I was just defending myself.

279
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:00,279
If you think

280
00:13:00,559 --> 00:13:02,399
torturing me will make me suffer,

281
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:03,919
you're wrong.

282
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:05,679
I'd rather die

283
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:07,600
I won't let you get what you want.

284
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:09,279
Really?

285
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:12,960
Don't worry.

286
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:14,639
I won't hold you accountable.

287
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:17,639
Killing him

288
00:13:18,120 --> 00:13:19,679
proves he's useless.

289
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:22,679
We don't keep useless people.

290
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:25,200
Pervert!

291
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:25,720
Grandma.

292
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:32,960
Brother.

293
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:34,240
Why are you here?

294
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:36,120
Xu?

295
00:13:36,919 --> 00:13:37,679
Who is she?

296
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,320
Xu.

297
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:42,840
What's going on?

298
00:13:46,559 --> 00:13:47,559
What did you say?

299
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:52,919
We love each other.

300
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:54,279
She was kidnapped.

301
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:56,480
I brought her back to heal.

302
00:13:56,679 --> 00:13:58,000
After she recovers,

303
00:13:58,279 --> 00:13:59,679
we'll get married.

304
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,600
Please bless us.

305
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:02,559
Brother,

306
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,200
are you kidding?

307
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:05,600
If you marry her,

308
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,000
what about the princess?

309
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:07,759
Xingtong,

310
00:14:08,559 --> 00:14:09,960
the princess is a noble lady.

311
00:14:10,759 --> 00:14:11,679
I and the princess

312
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,240
should be regarded as superior and subordinate.

313
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,320
We can't be disrespectful.

314
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,000
Xu,

315
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:19,960
You've already made all the arrangements.

316
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,240
Do you still need my approval?

317
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,080
Marriage is a major affair,

318
00:14:24,200 --> 00:14:26,519
traditionally decided by parents and matchmakers.

319
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,519
Your father passed away early.

320
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:31,480
If I let you marry without a matchmaker,

321
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:33,120
what would people

322
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:34,320
say about our family?

323
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:35,240
Grandma,

324
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:36,720
dad is gone.

325
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,480
His Majesty has ordered me to inherit the title.

326
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:40,960
The honor of the Fan family

327
00:14:43,159 --> 00:14:44,320
rests on me,

328
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:45,840
not on you.

329
00:14:46,919 --> 00:14:48,120
Don't say such things

330
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,159
like an illicit union.

331
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:52,080
I've already proposed to the Minister's family.

332
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:53,279
I will marry her

333
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,840
properly.

334
00:14:56,039 --> 00:14:56,720
Now,

335
00:14:56,759 --> 00:14:58,879
I can't control you anymore.

336
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,720
I don't care who she is.

337
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,159
I won't accept

338
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,919
such a woman as my granddaughter-in-law.

339
00:15:09,399 --> 00:15:11,159
My family has always been open-minded.

340
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:13,159
There's nothing we can't accept.

341
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:15,600
Grandma must be tired

342
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:16,720
to say such things.

343
00:15:17,879 --> 00:15:18,480
Xingtong,

344
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:20,679
help her back to bed.

345
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:21,600
Da?

346
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,799
I thought you'd argue,

347
00:15:40,159 --> 00:15:42,000
but you've gone silent.

348
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:45,559
This is Marquis Wei Yuan's residence.

349
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:47,120
They're all your friends and family.

350
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:48,759
Between you and me,

351
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,960
who would they believe?

352
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:51,480
Even a fool knows that.

353
00:15:52,559 --> 00:15:53,600
Would my words matter?

354
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,360
It would only bring shame upon myself.

355
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,879
I didn't expect

356
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,200
you to be so shameless.

357
00:15:59,039 --> 00:16:00,519
To deny the kidnapping,

358
00:16:00,919 --> 00:16:02,159
you even mentioned

359
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:03,240
love, marriage,

360
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,000
and betrothal.

361
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:07,000
You're smart,

362
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:09,000
thoughtful,

363
00:16:09,399 --> 00:16:10,720
and good at reading people.

364
00:16:11,879 --> 00:16:13,919
You're brave and ruthless.

365
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:15,919
If you were a man,

366
00:16:16,879 --> 00:16:18,080
you'd be a real talent.

367
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:19,639
What a pity.

368
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:21,759
What's the pity?

369
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,799
Even if you're smart,

370
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:25,399
you're still trapped by love.

371
00:16:26,039 --> 00:16:27,759
Your lover, Gu Hengyuan,

372
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,320
is about to take the final exam, right?

373
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:31,799
What do you want?

374
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:36,399
I want you

375
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,960
to marry into the Wei Yuan Marquisate.

376
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:40,840
You crazy woman!

377
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,720
Is it worth it to torment me

378
00:16:42,879 --> 00:16:43,279
with your lifetime happiness?

379
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:43,840
Yes.

380
00:16:45,840 --> 00:16:46,360
What did you say?

381
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,240
Before today,

382
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:53,559
I was wrong.

383
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:56,200
People like you

384
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,000
are not affected by

385
00:16:59,080 --> 00:17:00,519
ordinary setbacks.

386
00:17:00,960 --> 00:17:03,559
Only by cutting off your biggest wish

387
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:06,880
can you feel the real pain

388
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:09,039
like me.

389
00:18:21,759 --> 00:18:22,680
You should know that

390
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:24,480
you can't kill me.

391
00:18:30,920 --> 00:18:32,039
I can't kill you.

392
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,920
Don't you hate me for killing the one you love?

393
00:18:36,279 --> 00:18:37,680
I'll pay you with my life.

394
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:39,319
Please spare my family.

395
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:41,759
My family is innocent.

396
00:18:42,359 --> 00:18:43,799
I beg you, okay?

397
00:19:00,640 --> 00:19:01,400
Stop acting.

398
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:04,279
If I'm not mistaken,

399
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,559
your hairpin was just polished,

400
00:19:09,319 --> 00:19:10,640
the tip is still rounded.

401
00:19:11,480 --> 00:19:13,200
You don't want to die at all.

402
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:16,240
Why pretend to be pitiful?

403
00:19:19,599 --> 00:19:20,599
I thought

404
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:23,039
someone driven by love

405
00:19:23,759 --> 00:19:25,759
would have some softness in their heart.

406
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:28,039
Guess I was wrong.

407
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,920
You'll get a chance

408
00:19:39,160 --> 00:19:41,000
to know me.

409
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:44,759
My wife.
