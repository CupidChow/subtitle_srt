1
00:00:59,200 --> 00:00:59,880
Freshen up

2
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:00,719
Rest early

3
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:02,880
I'm quite tired

4
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,920
Honey

5
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:05,200
I don't want to do it myself

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,439
Alright

7
00:01:07,959 --> 00:01:08,799
Then just wait

8
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,719
Let me help you

9
00:01:25,079 --> 00:01:25,920
Aren't you tired?

10
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:27,120
Why aren't you resting?

11
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:28,599
Mm

12
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:30,159
Exhausted

13
00:01:30,879 --> 00:01:32,400
Every muscle aches

14
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:33,719
Completely drained

15
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,840
Let me massage you

16
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,239
Is Madam satisfied?

17
00:01:56,239 --> 00:01:57,079
Acceptable

18
00:01:58,719 --> 00:01:59,560
Never imagined

19
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:00,879
The decisive Marquis Weiyuan

20
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:02,040
Would be so henpecked

21
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,719
Caring for my wife

22
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,439
Is my fundamental duty

23
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,000
A surprise for you

24
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:36,879
Yuanzhi

25
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:39,159
Once mountains stood between us

26
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:40,159
Hearts full of wounds

27
00:02:41,159 --> 00:02:42,879
Fate preserved our bond

28
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:45,199
Past pains now fade

29
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,120
This was destined

30
00:02:47,759 --> 00:02:48,520
Through life and death

31
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,479
Since you hold my hand

32
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:51,759
I give my heart

33
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:52,960
Past like a dream

34
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,400
Painful yet cherished

35
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:55,919
I vow myself to you

36
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,080
Even should the God change

37
00:02:58,560 --> 00:02:59,639
With this life I pledge

38
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,039
To shelter your peace

39
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,000
Yuanzhi

40
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,680
This time I marry you sincerely

41
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,000
Will you marry me again?

42
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,319
Now two become one

43
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:13,800
Bound for eternity

44
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,920
Bow to heaven and earth

45
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:28,879
Bow to ancestors

46
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:39,399
Bow to each other

47
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:41,879
May your days without sorrow

48
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,600
Together till silver hairs

49
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:50,800
Release her

50
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:51,920
Don't come closer

51
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:53,839
Unless you want her dead

52
00:04:54,319 --> 00:04:55,680
Trade your life for hers

53
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:58,399
As long as you spare her

54
00:04:58,639 --> 00:04:59,600
I'll do anything

55
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:00,199
No

56
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:02,000
Don't

57
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,560
How utterly delightful

58
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,240
The Fan family bred such a lovesick fool

59
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:10,480
Here's the deal

60
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,360
Take that blade

61
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,040
Cut yourself first

62
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,040
Let me see

63
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,079
No

64
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:19,160
Fan Xingxu

65
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Don't listen to him

66
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:21,879
Marquis

67
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:23,839
Give me the knife

68
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:27,279
Give it

69
00:05:27,439 --> 00:05:28,160
Stop

70
00:05:34,439 --> 00:05:35,399
Fan Xingxu

71
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:36,319
Grandmother

72
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,399
Continue

73
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:40,759
I didn't say stop

74
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,000
No

75
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:53,120
Kneel down

76
00:05:55,959 --> 00:05:57,519
I said kneel down

77
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,040
You love him dearly

78
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:18,519
Should I make him die in front of you?

79
00:06:20,519 --> 00:06:21,800
Kill yourself now

80
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:28,600
Fan Xingxu

81
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,279
Hurry

82
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:30,600
I've told you

83
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,519
Nothing matters more than your own life

84
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:35,199
At life's crossroads

85
00:06:37,079 --> 00:06:38,399
I refuse your sacrifice

86
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,920
If you die for me

87
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,800
I'll feel no gratitude

88
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,879
Fan Xingxu

89
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:53,000
Do you hear me?

90
00:06:54,360 --> 00:06:56,079
How pitiful your love is

91
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,079
Always been since childhood

92
00:06:59,279 --> 00:07:01,680
Father's bastard with no mother's love

93
00:07:02,199 --> 00:07:03,519
No one in this world loves you
You'd better mean it

94
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:04,240
No one in this world loves you

95
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:07,160
Darling

96
00:07:09,519 --> 00:07:10,319
No

97
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:13,279
Take care of yourself

98
00:07:32,079 --> 00:07:32,759
Yuanzhi

99
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:33,720
Darling

100
00:07:35,399 --> 00:07:36,079
Darling

101
00:07:39,879 --> 00:07:41,160
You said

102
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,800
Nothing matters more than one's life

103
00:07:45,480 --> 00:07:46,839
Why save me?

104
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:48,920
I didn't want to save you

105
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,199
I just couldn't bear

106
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,279
Turning my wedding day

107
00:07:55,920 --> 00:07:57,759
Into my rival's death anniversary

108
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,360
Couldn't let him

109
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:05,399
Live with guilt over you

110
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:07,399
Darling

111
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:08,199
I'm fine

112
00:08:14,519 --> 00:08:15,480
Our love came

113
00:08:16,759 --> 00:08:17,959
Too hard-won

114
00:08:21,439 --> 00:08:22,439
I want us

115
00:08:23,639 --> 00:08:24,279
To be

116
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,560
Free of burdens

117
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,040
Unrestrained

118
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:30,680
Together

119
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:32,039
We will

120
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,320
I'll give all you desire

121
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:37,480
I won't let you die

122
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:40,799
I won't let you die

123
00:08:41,399 --> 00:08:42,080
Aiya

124
00:08:48,919 --> 00:08:50,120
I won't die

125
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,840
You hit quite hard

126
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,120
That really hurt

127
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:05,720
Since I often get injured

128
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,399
I carry this heart-protector

129
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:12,399
Thank goodness

130
00:09:12,759 --> 00:09:15,039
So this is how he loves

131
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:16,759
When truly devoted

132
00:09:20,559 --> 00:09:21,960
Don't scare me like that again

133
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,159
Don't fear

134
00:09:25,080 --> 00:09:26,200
I'll be alright

135
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:39,200
Fan Xingxu

136
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:40,759
I won't meddle in other matters

137
00:09:40,759 --> 00:09:42,600
But continuing the family line

138
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:43,840
Is your responsibility

139
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:46,759
Yuanzhi's been here three years without conceiving

140
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:48,080
Turns out

141
00:09:48,159 --> 00:09:49,639
You're avoiding parenthood

142
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:50,879
Grandmother

143
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,559
Matters of offspring

144
00:09:53,759 --> 00:09:55,279
Belong to us as couple

145
00:09:55,559 --> 00:09:56,759
Please enjoy your twilight years

146
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,080
When the time comes

147
00:09:58,159 --> 00:09:59,080
It will happen naturally

148
00:09:59,159 --> 00:10:00,919
What do you mean "when the time comes"?

149
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:01,919
Tell me

150
00:10:01,919 --> 00:10:04,039
You've been secretly drinking contraceptive tea

151
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:06,720
No man drinks contraceptive tea

152
00:10:06,879 --> 00:10:08,080
Have you lost your mind?

153
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,080
Grandmother

154
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,960
They have their plans

155
00:10:12,159 --> 00:10:13,759
Don't trouble yourself

156
00:10:14,039 --> 00:10:14,600
Xingtong

157
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,200
Escort grandmother to rest

158
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,240
Grandmother must be tired

159
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:18,039
I have matters

160
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:23,919
When will I hold my great-grandchild

161
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,120
Such an unfilial descendant

162
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:26,840
No

163
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:27,720
Today

164
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,360
I'll get answers from him

165
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:29,720
Hey

166
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,279
Hey

167
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,080
Grandmother

168
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:37,840
I saw him run here

169
00:10:37,919 --> 00:10:38,480
Where is he

170
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,360
Oh grandmother

171
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,039
Spare brother please

172
00:10:41,799 --> 00:10:43,320
What does a girl know?

173
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:44,559
Of three unfilial acts

174
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:45,720
No heir is gravest

175
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:47,480
But brother says

176
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:49,120
Young mothers risk

177
00:10:49,159 --> 00:10:50,559
Childbirth dangers

178
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,799
He cares for sis-in-law deeply

179
00:10:52,879 --> 00:10:54,240
Fears anything happening

180
00:10:54,360 --> 00:10:55,879
Wants absolute safety

181
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,279
All women face death's door

182
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:00,240
When giving birth

183
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,279
Others endure it

184
00:11:02,799 --> 00:11:03,720
They're not her

185
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:05,879
Knowing the danger

186
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,320
We should minimize risks

187
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,399
Brother loves her so

188
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,759
If pregnancy endangered her

189
00:11:10,799 --> 00:11:12,240
Truly threatened her life

190
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,559
I believe brother

191
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,399
Would rather die heirless

192
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,000
Don't speak nonsense

193
00:11:18,679 --> 00:11:21,000
You grow more insolent daily

194
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:24,279
Grandmother you're a woman

195
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:26,759
You understand our struggles best

196
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:28,360
Brother

197
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,759
Cares for her so thoughtfully

198
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:31,480
You should support him

199
00:11:31,840 --> 00:11:32,240
Well

200
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:33,879
Enough

201
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,440
From today

202
00:11:36,039 --> 00:11:37,200
Your generation's affairs

203
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:38,120
I'll meddle no more

204
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:39,840
My remaining years

205
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,559
Are few

206
00:11:42,759 --> 00:11:44,879
I should live for myself

207
00:11:45,679 --> 00:11:46,360
Today

208
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,200
I'll pack my bags

209
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:49,960
See southern blossoms

210
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:52,840
Grandmother

211
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,919
Take me with you

212
00:11:53,919 --> 00:11:54,720
I want to go

213
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,879
You should stop drinking

214
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,320
This contraceptive tea

215
00:11:57,759 --> 00:11:58,480
I can

216
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,120
No

217
00:11:59,799 --> 00:12:00,840
Not yet

218
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:02,360
Honey

219
00:12:02,799 --> 00:12:04,399
You care about me so much

220
00:12:04,919 --> 00:12:06,759
What if Xingtong is right

221
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,559
If her words prove true

222
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:17,039
I'll eliminate all threats

223
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:18,759
Before they emerge

224
00:12:20,279 --> 00:12:21,320
In this lifetime

225
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,600
I protect you only

226
00:12:23,799 --> 00:12:24,799
What can I do with you?

227
00:12:25,039 --> 00:12:26,799
Then reluctantly

228
00:12:27,879 --> 00:12:28,720
I'll indulge you

229
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:07,320
Do you believe fate

230
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,120
Governs all things?

231
00:13:09,919 --> 00:13:10,679
No

232
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:13,120
That means

233
00:13:13,399 --> 00:13:15,159
God decides, not I

234
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:16,799
I believe

235
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,080
I love you

236
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,039
By my own choice
