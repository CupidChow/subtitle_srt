1
00:00:56,679 --> 00:00:57,439
Smells amazing

2
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,400
Wow

3
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:08,120
Sis-in-law

4
00:01:08,319 --> 00:01:09,280
Early in the morning

5
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:09,920
You cooked this yourself

6
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:13,079
My favorite chicken noodle soup

7
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,359
Hey

8
00:01:13,959 --> 00:01:14,680
Ouch

9
00:01:15,599 --> 00:01:17,159
This is for your brother

10
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:20,359
My brother's had every delicacy there is

11
00:01:20,519 --> 00:01:21,439
He won't mind

12
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:27,200
Sis-in-law

13
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:30,159
Do you still resent me in your heart?

14
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:31,879
I was wrong

15
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,840
I truly didn't know He Weilan was evil

16
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:35,040
That's how she tricked me

17
00:01:36,959 --> 00:01:37,920
Is that all?

18
00:01:41,879 --> 00:01:42,359
What are you doing?

19
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:42,560
Get up

20
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:42,840
No

21
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:44,560
Sis-in-law

22
00:01:45,359 --> 00:01:46,959
I admit I used to look down on you

23
00:01:48,480 --> 00:01:50,359
I thought you were rebellious and arrogant

24
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:51,439
Totally unworthy of my brother

25
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,599
But after the Yanjing Temple incident

26
00:01:55,519 --> 00:01:56,879
I realized you—

27
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:00,640
You stayed calm in danger

28
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:01,879
Unshaken by chaos

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:03,879
When I was shaking with fear

30
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,799
You could still joke calmly

31
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,599
Buying time for everyone's escape

32
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:08,719
Sis-in-law

33
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,039
No

34
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:10,919
Shen Yuanzhi

35
00:02:12,199 --> 00:02:13,400
Even if you weren't my sis-in-law

36
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:15,120
You'd still be

37
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:16,159
The person I most admire

38
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:17,400
Respect

39
00:02:17,719 --> 00:02:18,919
And wish to become

40
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,840
I'm sorry

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,319
Can you forgive my past rudeness and arrogance?

42
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,280
Get up first

43
00:02:28,639 --> 00:02:28,960
No

44
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:31,000
If you won't forgive me

45
00:02:31,159 --> 00:02:32,159
I'll kneel forever

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,039
You just said

47
00:02:37,439 --> 00:02:38,039
You admire me

48
00:02:38,199 --> 00:02:38,879
Respect me

49
00:02:39,039 --> 00:02:40,199
Want to be like me

50
00:02:40,439 --> 00:02:40,719
Mm

51
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,120
Then you should know

52
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,360
Someone like me

53
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,520
Won't be bound by so-called etiquette

54
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,080
That's not what I meant

55
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,360
Alright alright

56
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:50,039
Enough teasing

57
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,280
I never hated you

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,479
So there's nothing to forgive

59
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:56,919
Really?

60
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:58,719
Others liking or hating me

61
00:02:58,800 --> 00:02:59,639
Means nothing to me

62
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,599
Sis-in-law

63
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,319
You're incredible

64
00:03:04,479 --> 00:03:05,840
I want to be free-spirited like you

65
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,520
I'm nothing special

66
00:03:07,639 --> 00:03:08,520
I'm just

67
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,120
An ordinary woman

68
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:10,520
No

69
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:11,879
You're different

70
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,280
You're unlike those

71
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:15,199
Women who live solely for their husbands

72
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,280
If all women

73
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:19,919
Could be like men

74
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,000
Study to gain wisdom

75
00:03:21,159 --> 00:03:22,039
Compete and strive

76
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,039
Never relinquish any right

77
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,319
And without harming others

78
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:27,879
Always put themselves first

79
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,520
They too could be free-spirited

80
00:03:29,759 --> 00:03:30,280
Liberated

81
00:03:30,719 --> 00:03:32,639
Women unbound by domestic life

82
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,159
I'm no better than them

83
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,759
Just luckier

84
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,400
To have realized this truth earlier

85
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,000
There's enough for another bowl

86
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,080
If you want some

87
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,120
Yes please

88
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:47,800
Mm

89
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:49,439
This is so delicious

90
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:11,520
It's me

91
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:13,680
Sorry

92
00:04:19,079 --> 00:04:20,319
Don't come to my room

93
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,639
Without permission

94
00:04:23,279 --> 00:04:25,000
Your room my room

95
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,240
We're married

96
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:27,839
We should share a room

97
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,680
What do you mean？

98
00:04:32,079 --> 00:04:33,519
I'm moving in with you

99
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:38,120
No

100
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,439
Let me help

101
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,079
Do you know what you're doing?

102
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:39,079
Fulfilling

103
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,279
A wife's duties

104
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:46,680
Let go of me

105
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:48,079
I'm warning you

106
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:50,360
Whoever plays with fire will get burned

107
00:05:52,319 --> 00:05:54,120
You really don't know how to be gentle

108
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:55,079
But that's fine

109
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,319
Proves you're not interested in active women throwing

110
00:05:58,839 --> 00:06:00,279
My taste is excellent

111
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:05,600
Hey

112
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:07,759
I cooked

113
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:08,839
Try it

114
00:06:25,079 --> 00:06:26,000
I don't like noodles

115
00:06:26,680 --> 00:06:27,800
Don't waste your effort

116
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,279
Is accepting my kindness

117
00:06:34,519 --> 00:06:35,600
So difficult for you?

118
00:07:33,399 --> 00:07:34,160
Come out

119
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,399
What are you doing here?

120
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:40,800
I told you

121
00:07:41,079 --> 00:07:42,279
We're married

122
00:07:42,519 --> 00:07:43,759
We share a room

123
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:47,600
Get dressed

124
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:48,959
Stop messing around

125
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:50,040
Go back

126
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:57,240
I once carried you for miles

127
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:58,399
What's wrong with

128
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,199
Carrying me now?

129
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:02,360
Get down

130
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:14,079
Your ears are red

131
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:15,720
Feeling shy?
