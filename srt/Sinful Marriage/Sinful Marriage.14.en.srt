1
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:05,959
Shen Yuanzhi

2
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,519
Shen Yuanzhi

3
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:14,920
Shen Yuanzhi

4
00:01:18,359 --> 00:01:19,159
My debt to you

5
00:01:19,599 --> 00:01:20,439
Is repaid

6
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:22,159
Yuanzhi

7
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:24,159
It's alright

8
00:01:30,719 --> 00:01:31,280
Take them away

9
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,719
Hand them over to the Ministry of Justice

10
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:33,159
Yes!

11
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,439
Something puzzles me

12
00:02:11,759 --> 00:02:13,240
Your mind is so meticulous

13
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,080
Your calculations flawless

14
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,039
For someone like you

15
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:18,560
Was Princess Nine's death

16
00:02:19,199 --> 00:02:20,560
Truly unexpected?

17
00:02:22,240 --> 00:02:22,879
What do you mean?

18
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:26,960
Princess Nine personally admitted to killing He Weilan

19
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,280
You never forgets a grievance

20
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,479
Would you truly let her off easily?

21
00:02:32,599 --> 00:02:34,000
But her status is noble

22
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:35,240
Dealing with her

23
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,960
Would not have been easy

24
00:02:37,560 --> 00:02:38,280
So

25
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,199
Using another's hand

26
00:02:40,639 --> 00:02:42,159
Was the best method

27
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:44,680
Killing two birds with one stone –

28
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:46,319
Uncovering the mastermind

29
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,479
While removing your thorn

30
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,360
The pain in your side

31
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:50,840
And conveniently

32
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,159
You were gravely injured

33
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,280
Perfectly avoiding all suspicion

34
00:02:57,080 --> 00:02:58,439
I don't understand you

35
00:02:59,039 --> 00:03:00,280
I always thought you were clever

36
00:03:01,439 --> 00:03:02,000
But

37
00:03:03,039 --> 00:03:05,319
Sometimes being overly clever isn't a good thing

38
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,039
You need to learn

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:09,639
To hide wisdom within simplicity

40
00:03:10,439 --> 00:03:11,879
Don't be so relentlessly curious

41
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,280
Otherwise

42
00:03:13,719 --> 00:03:15,280
Even if I don't trouble you

43
00:03:15,719 --> 00:03:17,240
You'll be the death of yourself

44
00:03:18,439 --> 00:03:20,120
I have the answer I sought

45
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,080
I will remember today's words

46
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:29,159
Are you alright?

47
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,240
I'm fine

48
00:03:32,039 --> 00:03:32,680
An old ailment

49
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,240
When I'm tired

50
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,360
I get these headaches

51
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:37,960
Resting helps

52
00:03:40,960 --> 00:03:42,560
I'll have the servants prepare some food

53
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,159
Red bean soup, your usual favorite

54
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:45,960
Alright?

55
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:50,199
Or do you not want sweet soup?

56
00:03:52,439 --> 00:03:53,080
I'll call the physician

57
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:53,560
No need

58
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:55,879
I said I'm fine

59
00:03:59,199 --> 00:03:59,719
You...

60
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:01,960
Why are you being so good to me?

61
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,439
Because I was wrong

62
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:13,039
Weilan's death

63
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:14,759
Had nothing to do with you

64
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,439
I was arrogant

65
00:04:17,879 --> 00:04:19,079
Misjudged the truth

66
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:20,959
Vented my own incompetence

67
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:23,439
And anger on you

68
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,639
Are you apologizing to me?

69
00:04:28,279 --> 00:04:29,480
At the hunting grounds

70
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:30,680
Didn't you say

71
00:04:30,839 --> 00:04:32,120
There were still unanswered questions?

72
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,720
That my life was still in your hands?

73
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:36,319
The act had to be convincing

74
00:04:37,439 --> 00:04:38,160
Besides

75
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:39,480
Given the circumstances then

76
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,319
It was better we seemed at odds

77
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,000
So

78
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:46,079
You believed me long ago, didn't you?

79
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:54,600
Finally

80
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,600
This mistake

81
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,759
I will remember forever

82
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,759
From now on

83
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:06,240
I won't repeat it

84
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:27,360
It's snow

85
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:11,759
Don't catch cold

86
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:15,879
You like snow?

87
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:17,800
Mhm

88
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,720
When I followed my father on his transfer

89
00:06:21,879 --> 00:06:22,680
I went to the Northern Desert

90
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,800
There, ice stretched for miles

91
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,240
Snow and ice everywhere

92
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,439
I was foolish back then

93
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:30,079
Licked an icicle outdoors

94
00:06:33,879 --> 00:06:34,680
Then...

95
00:06:34,680 --> 00:06:36,360
My tongue got stuck and wouldn't come off

96
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,839
Made a huge fool of myself

97
00:06:44,399 --> 00:06:45,279
Back then

98
00:06:45,439 --> 00:06:46,519
My mother was still alive

99
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:49,279
Our family was happy every day

100
00:06:50,439 --> 00:06:52,439
Those were my happiest days

101
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:57,959
But after returning to the capital

102
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,920
I never saw snow this heavy again

103
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:05,319
Weilan also loved snow

104
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,879
I remember when I first saw her

105
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:09,959
Holding an oil-paper umbrella

106
00:07:11,279 --> 00:07:12,600
A jade hairpin in her hair

107
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,879
The pin was clear as ice

108
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:21,639
On the jade hairpin

109
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:23,240
Were tiny silver bells

110
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,319
As she walked, they swayed

111
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,360
Making a soft, clear sound

112
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:28,879
Like the voice of an ice river

113
00:08:18,480 --> 00:08:19,839
Brother Xingxu

114
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:29,199
Brother Xingxu

115
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,200
Weilan

116
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:06,559
You've waited so long

117
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:07,399
Today

118
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:09,399
You finally have your wish fulfilled

119
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,799
What is happening?

120
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,320
I accompanied Grandmother

121
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,720
To pray at Yanjing Temple

122
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,919
We found Miss He unconscious by the mountain path

123
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:17,960
So

124
00:09:18,039 --> 00:09:19,200
We brought her back

125
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:22,879
Weilan was injured

126
00:09:22,960 --> 00:09:24,639
She doesn't remember many things

127
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,799
But she kept

128
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,720
Repeating your name

129
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,240
Then we knew

130
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:30,639
She knew you

131
00:09:31,399 --> 00:09:33,399
Thinking she was alone and helpless

132
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:34,919
Having suffered this calamity

133
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:36,360
It seemed so pitiful

134
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,240
So

135
00:09:37,240 --> 00:09:38,480
I brought her back

136
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:42,320
Reported killed by a carriage in the marketplace

137
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,679
Verified by the Capital Prefect himself

138
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:46,120
Buried

139
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:48,799
How could she appear at Yanjing Temple miles away?

140
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,879
Sister-in-law, what do you imply?

141
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,000
The master at Yanjing Temple said

142
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:53,519
Weilan

143
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:54,879
Has an extraordinary fate

144
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:55,919
Even if

145
00:09:55,919 --> 00:09:57,120
Between life and death

146
00:09:57,399 --> 00:09:58,879
She gains Heaven's protection

147
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,320
Surviving countless calamities

148
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:01,519
While breath remained

149
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:02,799
Like withered wood meeting spring

150
00:10:02,799 --> 00:10:04,000
Life returned instantly

151
00:10:05,639 --> 00:10:06,720
In this world

152
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:08,279
Fortune, misfortune, life, death

153
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,279
Heaven and Earth

154
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:10,879
Have their own way to protect her

155
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,080
Though fate may be treacherous

156
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:14,919
She would

157
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,240
Eventually return to the mortal world

158
00:10:16,519 --> 00:10:17,519
As the saying goes

159
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:18,960
A phoenix rising from ashes

160
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:20,440
Reborn through fire

161
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:21,600
Such a fate

162
00:10:21,799 --> 00:10:23,240
Is beyond mortal stars

163
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,039
Ordinary people

164
00:10:25,080 --> 00:10:26,440
Cannot fathom it

165
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,080
Truly a rare marvel

166
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:35,759
Congratulations, Miss He

167
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:37,200
On your miraculous escape

168
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,120
This puts my mind at ease

169
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,759
You are...

170
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:47,480
Oh

171
00:10:47,919 --> 00:10:48,639
She is my sister-in-law

172
00:10:49,039 --> 00:10:50,440
Newly married into the residence

173
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:55,639
You...

174
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,039
You married?

175
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,039
Yes

176
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:07,039
Ah!

177
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,519
Old friends reunited

178
00:11:09,840 --> 00:11:11,519
You two catch up properly

179
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:13,279
Yuanzhi

180
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:14,639
I

181
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:17,399
Specially brought you a peace talisman from the temple

182
00:11:17,559 --> 00:11:19,399
Come with me to get it

183
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,159
Thank you, Grandmother

184
00:11:23,879 --> 00:11:24,639
Come along

185
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,159
I don't know what happened

186
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:40,480
Many things

187
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,039
I don't remember

188
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,679
But everything about you

189
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:46,080
I remember clearly

190
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:47,679
Perhaps

191
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,080
Heaven pitied me

192
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:52,799
Wanted to fulfill a regret

193
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:55,360
So gave me another

194
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,360
Chance to begin again

195
00:11:59,559 --> 00:12:00,559
No matter what

196
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:01,720
That you are alive

197
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,159
Is truly wonderful

198
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:09,000
You once told me

199
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:11,639
You loved me

200
00:12:13,039 --> 00:12:14,240
I didn't understand then

201
00:12:15,240 --> 00:12:16,120
I just felt

202
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,519
The time wasn't right

203
00:12:17,919 --> 00:12:18,960
So I refused you

204
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:20,360
Afterwards

205
00:12:20,759 --> 00:12:22,080
I regretted it deeply

206
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:25,159
Wanted to find the right moment

207
00:12:26,039 --> 00:12:27,519
To tell you my feelings

208
00:12:27,799 --> 00:12:28,879
To let you know

209
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:31,120
You weren't imagining things

210
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:45,960
I did love you once

211
00:12:47,919 --> 00:12:49,279
Perhaps the timing was wrong

212
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:50,519
Fate without destiny

213
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,120
And now

214
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:53,440
I have a wife

215
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,399
Between us

216
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,320
Since nothing began

217
00:12:57,960 --> 00:12:59,320
That fate has ended

218
00:13:01,679 --> 00:13:02,960
It's best to stop here

219
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:10,440
I don't believe it

220
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,600
The person you love is me

221
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,279
You married her

222
00:13:14,519 --> 00:13:15,759
Only because of a misunderstanding

223
00:13:15,919 --> 00:13:17,519
Wanting to avenge me, right?

224
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:19,600
I know everything

225
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,399
Since I'm not dead

226
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:23,759
Let her go

227
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,600
We can return to how things were

228
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:34,879
I won't let her go

229
00:13:35,840 --> 00:13:37,240
She is my wife

230
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,919
You're just guilty you wronged the wrong person

231
00:13:42,159 --> 00:13:43,679
How could you love someone else?

232
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:46,200
I won't allow it

233
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,679
Come in

234
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,440
I thought

235
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:11,480
You wouldn't seek me out

236
00:14:11,559 --> 00:14:13,200
Your beloved returned from the dead

237
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:14,159
I haven't congratulated you yet

238
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:16,799
I came for the divorce papers

239
00:14:18,039 --> 00:14:19,679
Lovers finally united

240
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:21,080
I'm happy for you both

241
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,039
I wish you

242
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,759
Eternal unity of heart

243
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:26,320
A century of harmony

244
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:44,679
So eager to divorce me?

245
00:14:45,039 --> 00:14:46,080
Marquis, what do you mean?

246
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:48,240
The truth is out

247
00:14:48,559 --> 00:14:50,120
Isn't it time for this unlucky one to leave?

248
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,399
Once we divorce

249
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,919
You can properly marry Miss He into the residence

250
00:14:54,919 --> 00:14:56,480
Isn't that best for everyone?

251
00:15:04,639 --> 00:15:05,799
I won't marry her

252
00:15:06,879 --> 00:15:08,480
Whether you marry her is none of my business

253
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,360
I'm not interested in your

254
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:12,039
Lovey-dovey affairs

255
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,919
I just want a peaceful life

256
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:16,000
Fan Xingxu

257
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:17,440
Let me go

258
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:21,279
He Weilan's death

259
00:15:21,799 --> 00:15:23,639
Isn't as simple as it seems

260
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:24,679
Yes

261
00:15:25,679 --> 00:15:26,799
I did love her once

262
00:15:27,679 --> 00:15:28,919
But I'm not a fool

263
00:15:29,679 --> 00:15:31,759
I won't let emotions blind me

264
00:15:32,279 --> 00:15:33,679
Deceive myself that all is fine

265
00:15:34,279 --> 00:15:34,840
So

266
00:15:35,799 --> 00:15:36,759
I won't divorce

267
00:15:37,559 --> 00:15:38,960
I need you to stay

268
00:15:40,279 --> 00:15:41,440
You need me?

269
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:42,879
Yes

270
00:15:44,759 --> 00:15:45,679
I need you

271
00:15:46,039 --> 00:15:46,480
Help me

272
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:54,919
Someone who only ever threatened me

273
00:15:55,440 --> 00:15:57,559
Hearing 'help' from you

274
00:15:57,919 --> 00:15:58,600
Is rare indeed

275
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,360
Must you embarrass me like this?

276
00:16:01,879 --> 00:16:03,360
A man's pride is paramount

277
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:04,360
My life

278
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,480
Worth less than grass

279
00:16:05,919 --> 00:16:06,480
Tell me

280
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:07,759
How do you want me to help?

281
00:16:09,080 --> 00:16:10,279
Don't belittle yourself

282
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,039
I was too harsh before

283
00:16:16,360 --> 00:16:17,240
I'm sorry

284
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,960
I want you to help me uncover the truth

285
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:24,519
Without alerting anyone

286
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:26,480
Use every method to provoke her

287
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,879
I return that phrase to you

288
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,399
So quickly

289
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,000
You severed love?

290
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,799
Will you help

291
00:16:36,039 --> 00:16:37,080
Or not?

292
00:16:39,159 --> 00:16:40,679
I can play the villainess

293
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,600
But once everything is settled

294
00:16:43,600 --> 00:16:44,639
After the divorce

295
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,879
I not only take my dowry

296
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:48,840
I want half the Marquis estate's

297
00:16:48,960 --> 00:16:49,879
Assets

298
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,399
As you wish
