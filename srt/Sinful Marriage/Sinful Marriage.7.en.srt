1
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:55,799
Miss,

2
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,840
drink the medicine.

3
00:00:57,119 --> 00:00:57,719
The doctor said

4
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,200
you need to rest well this time.

5
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,920
Otherwise, your arm will be useless.

6
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:04,040
No.

7
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,799
Do not drink it.

8
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:09,920
Lord Second, are you crazy?

9
00:01:10,120 --> 00:01:11,920
I decocted it for a long time.

10
00:01:12,359 --> 00:01:13,280
It's been replaced.

11
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:14,840
Though not poison,

12
00:01:15,319 --> 00:01:16,640
someones lined their own pockets

13
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,400
and replaced it with cheap herbs.

14
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:20,000
Not only will it not heal,

15
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:22,079
it'll delay treatment

16
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,519
and leave a lingering illness.

17
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,239
How could that happen?

18
00:01:25,519 --> 00:01:27,040
Everyone in the mansion knows

19
00:01:27,319 --> 00:01:28,640
your injury was caused by my brother.

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,359
I know him well.

21
00:01:30,519 --> 00:01:32,159
He protects what he likes.

22
00:01:32,519 --> 00:01:33,200
But

23
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:35,040
he'll do everything to destroy what he hates.

24
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,439
He'll let the rumors spread.

25
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:38,319
Then everyone in the mansion

26
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,640
will see you as a target for humiliation.

27
00:01:40,879 --> 00:01:42,560
Once someone is weak,

28
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,879
they'll feel fear

29
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:47,079
and fall into endless trouble.

30
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:49,560
In the end,

31
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:51,920
you'll see the worst of humanity.

32
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,879
Once you've had enough disappointment,

33
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,159
your spirit

34
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:58,840
will be completely crushed.

35
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:08,879
I'll take you to see the doctor.

36
00:02:17,039 --> 00:02:18,240
What are you doing?

37
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,719
She's sick.

38
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:22,439
I'm taking her to the doctor.

39
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,319
She's your sister-in-law.

40
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,000
What are you doing?

41
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:28,000
Have you ever treated her as your wife?

42
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,039
Let her go.

43
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,400
Fan Xingchen.

44
00:02:55,719 --> 00:02:56,800
Gossip kills.

45
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:59,240
There are some things I can do

46
00:02:59,719 --> 00:03:00,960
but you can't.

47
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:17,719
Let me go.

48
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,719
Let me go.

49
00:03:20,039 --> 00:03:20,479
What?

50
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,639
You want to seduce my brother

51
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,000
and count on him to save you?

52
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:23,639
Yes.

53
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,319
I just want to seduce your brother.

54
00:03:25,919 --> 00:03:27,280
At least he won't be as

55
00:03:27,719 --> 00:03:29,000
heartless as you.

56
00:03:33,199 --> 00:03:35,120
If you want to cheat on me,

57
00:03:35,199 --> 00:03:36,400
you should choose someone else.

58
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,120
He...

59
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,360
You can't afford to mess with him.

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,039
You made everyone look down on me,

61
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:44,120
and treat me like fish on the cutting board.

62
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,759
You must be very happy, right?

63
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,479
Why pretend to be virtuous now?

64
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:48,560
You're half right.

65
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:50,879
I did want to isolate you

66
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,719
and humiliate you.

67
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:54,120
But I'm not happy.

68
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,479
What do you want?

69
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:58,280
You said that

70
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,400
once a person is weak,

71
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,280
he will be afraid

72
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,199
and fall into endless trouble.

73
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:06,879
But you

74
00:04:07,479 --> 00:04:08,800
are not afraid.

75
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:10,479
So I'm unhappy.

76
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,000
Fan Xingxu,

77
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:17,720
will you be afraid

78
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:20,120
to fall down from here?

79
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:23,879
You don't kill me,

80
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:25,199
and you don't let me die.

81
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,399
It's wrong to ask you to let me go.

82
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:29,639
It's also wrong to prove my innocence.

83
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,519
It's wrong to please you

84
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,759
and make you think I'm useful.

85
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:35,279
Since it's all wrong,

86
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:37,279
I must fight for myself.

87
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:39,959
I wanted to kill you with the help of others,

88
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,079
but I ended up being the one who was killed.

89
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,399
Fan Xingxu,

90
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,560
I admit

91
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:46,920
that I lost to you.

92
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:52,959
You don't seem like someone who admits defeat easily.

93
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,240
Since I've tried everything,

94
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:57,680
there's only one last thing left.

95
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:58,920
Oh.

96
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,279
What else is missing?

97
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:13,399
We'll fight to the death.

98
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,040
We'll perish together.

99
00:05:22,879 --> 00:05:23,800
Miss!

100
00:05:24,879 --> 00:05:25,360
Miss!

101
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:25,920
Shen Yuanzhi!

102
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:33,959
Wake up!

103
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:36,879
Shen Yuanzhi!

104
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:40,360
Shen Yuanzhi!

105
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,920
Miss!

106
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,720
Miss, please wake up!

107
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,560
Shen Yuanzhi!

108
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,920
Miss!

109
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:46,639
Miss!

110
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,279
Wake up!

111
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:55,680
Miss!

112
00:05:59,519 --> 00:06:00,360
Miss!

113
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,560
You can't

114
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:21,319
die here!

115
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:23,600
Miss!

116
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,600
Miss!

117
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:25,199
Miss!

118
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,720
Are you alright?

119
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:27,680
My Lady!

120
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:29,639
My Lady!

121
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,439
How are you?

122
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:34,360
Feeling better?

123
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,160
You married a jinx.

124
00:06:44,519 --> 00:06:45,279
She's too weak

125
00:06:45,319 --> 00:06:46,800
to live long.

126
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:48,399
If she dies in the mansion,

127
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,360
people will

128
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:51,319
laugh at us for years.

129
00:06:51,519 --> 00:06:52,120
Grandma,

130
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,160
She just fell into the water.

131
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:55,759
The doctor said she's fine.

132
00:06:56,480 --> 00:06:57,959
Just need some rest.

133
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,439
Why are you defending her?

134
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,519
You don't know how dangerous she is.

135
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,480
She's causing trouble for the whole family.

136
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:07,399
Grandma,

137
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:08,399
she's awake.

138
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:22,720
My dear.

139
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:24,920
Your Highness.

140
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:26,279
You got the wrong person.

141
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,759
He's your brother-in-law.

142
00:07:28,439 --> 00:07:29,639
He's your husband.

143
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,759
He's not my husband.

144
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,600
He is.

145
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,480
Say it again.

146
00:07:41,519 --> 00:07:42,279
It hurts.

147
00:07:42,279 --> 00:07:43,279
Let go of me.

148
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,160
Honey.

149
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:46,879
I'm scared.

150
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,000
You seduced

151
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,959
my grandson,

152
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,920
and now you're after my little grandchild.

153
00:07:53,279 --> 00:07:55,480
I'll skin that fox hide off you today!

154
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:58,519
Chen,

155
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,800
you hit my husband.

156
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:12,319
Are you done yet?

157
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,240
I've told you,

158
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,240
you're not my husband.

159
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:32,519
You're hurting me.

160
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:33,200
My dear.

161
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:35,080
I said I don't know you.

162
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:35,879
Who are you?

163
00:08:37,240 --> 00:08:38,600
I have a headache.

164
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,279
I can't remember anything.

165
00:08:46,639 --> 00:08:47,799
You treat me like this.

166
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,399
Don't you fear your lover won't rest in peace?

167
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:54,600
Stop pretending.

168
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:56,600
Is it fun?

169
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,080
Didn't you accuse me of cuckolding you?

170
00:09:00,759 --> 00:09:01,960
Fine, I'll show you exactly.

171
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:03,759
Like the view?

172
00:09:09,919 --> 00:09:11,120
Don't touch me.

173
00:09:14,559 --> 00:09:15,200
Fine.

174
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:17,960
Since you like Fan Xingchen so much,

175
00:09:18,279 --> 00:09:19,559
I'll give you a chance.

176
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,600
No matter what method you use,

177
00:09:21,919 --> 00:09:23,440
if you can win his love

178
00:09:23,559 --> 00:09:25,080
and gain his full trust,

179
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,720
I'll let you go.

180
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:46,200
Shush.

181
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,200
What are you doing here?

182
00:09:54,519 --> 00:09:55,320
Honey,

183
00:09:56,279 --> 00:09:57,200
I'm your wife.

184
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,919
Isn't it normal for me to come to you?

185
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,919
I guess you got a brain injury.

186
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:09,000
I'm not your husband.

187
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:09,919
Your Highness,

188
00:10:12,039 --> 00:10:13,000
don't be nervous.

189
00:10:13,879 --> 00:10:14,960
I don't have amnesia.

190
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,720
If I say

191
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,919
I have a crush on you

192
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:21,960
and fall in love with you,

193
00:10:22,759 --> 00:10:23,759
do you believe me?

194
00:10:43,039 --> 00:10:45,120
Fan Xingxu asked me to seduce you

195
00:10:45,399 --> 00:10:46,799
and gain your trust.

196
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,240
He asked me to be a pawn in your life.

197
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:54,720
You are so shy.

198
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,240
Don't turn around.

199
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,159
He is watching you outside the door.

200
00:11:02,559 --> 00:11:03,720
What do you want?

201
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:06,000
Compared with him,

202
00:11:06,279 --> 00:11:07,519
I trust you more.

203
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,320
He tried to kill me several times.

204
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:13,120
I want to cooperate with you more.

205
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:15,120
Deal.

206
00:11:22,679 --> 00:11:23,440
I believe you.

207
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,840
Because I like you, too.
