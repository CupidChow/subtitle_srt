1
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,799
Next time you need to act

2
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,799
Give me prior notice

3
00:01:08,599 --> 00:01:10,840
Half the Marquis Weiyuan's estate

4
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:13,079
Isn't so easily obtained

5
00:01:14,239 --> 00:01:15,280
I was entrusted with a task

6
00:01:15,879 --> 00:01:16,959
So I fulfill it faithfully

7
00:01:30,319 --> 00:01:31,200
Why are you undressing?

8
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,719
Didn't you tell me to provoke her?

9
00:01:37,719 --> 00:01:38,920
The night is long

10
00:01:40,319 --> 00:01:41,519
As couple

11
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,400
Naturally we share a bed

12
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,719
You reunited with an old flame today

13
00:02:05,879 --> 00:02:07,000
Must be emotionally drained

14
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:08,360
You should rest early

15
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,159
Better get some sleep now

16
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,080
This time

17
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:27,199
Using risky tactics

18
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:29,560
We finally preserved the peace talks outcome

19
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:32,159
Thanks to the Marquis's assistance

20
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:33,240
Otherwise

21
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,919
I'd likely be headless by now

22
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,439
After returning

23
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,840
I'll report everything to His Majesty

24
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:39,919
We'll uncover

25
00:02:40,199 --> 00:02:41,560
Who was behind this sabotage

26
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,919
Undermining the peace talks

27
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:45,520
Mountains part, rivers flow

28
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:46,639
Till we meet again

29
00:02:49,039 --> 00:02:49,759
Take care

30
00:02:51,439 --> 00:02:52,919
Give my regards to your wife

31
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,000
Marquis!

32
00:03:08,039 --> 00:03:09,120
We've got a lead

33
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:11,319
Go!

34
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:23,000
How could this be?

35
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:47,639
Returned from the dead...

36
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:50,479
Do you believe in supernatural forces?

37
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:51,439
I don't know, Sir

38
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,439
I personally witnessed Miss He's burial

39
00:03:55,759 --> 00:03:57,439
You said the two gravediggers

40
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,520
Resigned and returned home weeks ago?

41
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:00,400
Yes

42
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,319
Their hometowns are nearby

43
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,039
I've dispatched men to investigate

44
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:04,680
No

45
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,520
Go personally

46
00:04:06,759 --> 00:04:08,000
Bring them back at all costs

47
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:08,560
Yes

48
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,800
I hope it's not what I suspect

49
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:25,600
Miss!

50
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:28,600
The Marquis hasn't troubled you lately

51
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:30,519
He even stays in your chamber nightly

52
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:33,519
Are our good days finally here?

53
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:35,040
Nonsense

54
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:38,199
This is escaping tigers only to enter wolves' den

55
00:04:38,279 --> 00:04:39,199
My greatest lesson

56
00:04:39,399 --> 00:04:40,560
In this lifetime

57
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,839
Was trusting men's words

58
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:44,519
Life rests in one's own hands

59
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,240
To change fate

60
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,959
One must ultimately rely on oneself

61
00:04:49,079 --> 00:04:51,079
Since you married into the Marquis household

62
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,160
Your words grow harder to grasp

63
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,639
Since arriving

64
00:05:06,879 --> 00:05:08,360
I've yet to speak with you, sister

65
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,120
As Brother Xingxu's wife

66
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:12,279
I naturally

67
00:05:12,519 --> 00:05:14,000
Wish to be closer to you

68
00:05:14,399 --> 00:05:16,120
"Sister" this, "Sister" that?

69
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:17,199
Our Madam

70
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,720
Is an only child

71
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:19,879
She has no sisters

72
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:23,000
The Marquis will soon marry Miss He properly

73
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,560
Then Madam will naturally call her "Sister"

74
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:27,399
You—

75
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:28,879
How dare you spread lies

76
00:05:29,279 --> 00:05:31,199
The Dowager has already decided this

77
00:05:31,279 --> 00:05:33,040
The entire Marquis residence knows

78
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:35,040
Men having multiple wives is normal

79
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,680
Especially for our Marquis

80
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:39,879
Madam

81
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,000
As the mistress

82
00:05:41,079 --> 00:05:42,680
Must know household management well

83
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:43,639
Surely

84
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,720
You possess magnanimity?

85
00:05:45,839 --> 00:05:46,480
You...

86
00:05:47,399 --> 00:05:48,519
My maid

87
00:05:48,759 --> 00:05:49,839
Is straightforward

88
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:50,879
Always speaks bluntly

89
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:52,120
Dislikes pretense

90
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,480
Sister

91
00:05:53,879 --> 00:05:55,240
Don't take it to heart

92
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,079
Ah!

93
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:08,639
You—

94
00:06:09,279 --> 00:06:09,839
Ah!

95
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:13,839
Since you call me Mistress

96
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,199
I'll teach you

97
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,279
How to respect the lady of the house

98
00:06:18,199 --> 00:06:19,439
How I manage this household

99
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:20,879
Whether I'm magnanimous—

100
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:22,839
These aren't yours to judge

101
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:24,199
Moreover

102
00:06:24,439 --> 00:06:25,800
Spreading rumors

103
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,439
Damaging Miss He's reputation—

104
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:28,600
What are your true intentions?

105
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,839
Miss He

106
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,439
Sister, what do you mean?

107
00:06:39,519 --> 00:06:41,040
My husband told me everything

108
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:42,680
About your circumstances

109
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,000
Your tragic past

110
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:50,439
This great calamity

111
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,720
We rejoice at your miraculous return

112
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,279
He told me

113
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,759
He wishes to treat you

114
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,879
As his own younger sister

115
00:06:57,879 --> 00:06:58,839
Keeping you in the residence

116
00:06:59,519 --> 00:07:00,519
Rest assured

117
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,720
In the future

118
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,879
I'll regard you like Xingtong

119
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:05,199
Treating you as

120
00:07:05,279 --> 00:07:06,560
My own sister

121
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,160
Sister?

122
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,439
Yes

123
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,680
Though the Marquis and I never met before marriage

124
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:15,000
Living together since

125
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,079
Affection grew over time

126
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
He vowed to me

127
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,120
That in this life

128
00:07:18,399 --> 00:07:19,639
He'd marry only me

129
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:22,480
The Dowager must have misunderstood

130
00:07:22,680 --> 00:07:24,800
Servants gossiping irresponsibly

131
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:26,959
Don't let this tarnish your reputation

132
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Henceforth, like Xingtong

133
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,120
Call me Sister-in-law

134
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:31,839
Agreed?

135
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:35,959
Sister-in-law?

136
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:37,279
I don't believe it

137
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,399
I'll ask Brother Xingxu myself

138
00:07:43,959 --> 00:07:45,120
How shameless

139
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:46,519
To covet another's husband

140
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:49,120
Before even marrying

141
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:50,040
Watch your words

142
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:51,399
What did I say earlier?

143
00:07:51,839 --> 00:07:53,120
No spreading rumors

144
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,920
Don't ruin the lady's reputation

145
00:07:55,079 --> 00:07:56,040
Yes

146
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:56,920
Well

147
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:57,839
Pack my things

148
00:07:58,439 --> 00:07:59,480
I must prepare

149
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,120
For the next act of this play

150
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:02,040
Play?

151
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:03,720
What play?

152
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,240
Miss

153
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:07,720
Sister-in-law

154
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,079
In such a hurry?

155
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:10,000
Where are you going?

156
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:11,839
To see your elder brother

157
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:13,399
Yuanzhi

158
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:15,319
Though newly wed

159
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:17,680
You shouldn't cling to your husband daily

160
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,439
If this spreads

161
00:08:18,519 --> 00:08:21,000
People will mock your lack of propriety

162
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,360
Grandmother

163
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,360
The Marquis and I share deep affection

164
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,279
Harmonious as zither and lute

165
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:26,680
Shouldn't this be celebrated?

166
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,399
Let the whole world know

167
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,680
So no one dares

168
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:31,560
To harbor ill intentions

169
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:33,039
Or covet

170
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,799
What isn't theirs

171
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,639
Sister-in-law

172
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:38,759
Are you implying

173
00:08:38,879 --> 00:08:40,240
We wronged you by bringing Miss He back?

174
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,799
Damaged your marriage?

175
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:42,840
Oh?

176
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,360
I meant no such thing

177
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,519
But if you insist

178
00:08:47,679 --> 00:08:48,679
I cannot stop you

179
00:08:48,759 --> 00:08:49,679
Shen Yuanzhi

180
00:08:50,159 --> 00:08:52,200
Have you no respect for hierarchy or propriety?

181
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,840
A crooked beam makes a crooked house

182
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,960
If elders lack virtue

183
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,759
How can juniors learn propriety?

184
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:00,960
First reflect on yourself

185
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,639
Then you may preach to others

186
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:07,919
Step aside, please

187
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,399
I'm going to see my husband

188
00:09:10,919 --> 00:09:11,360
Ah!

189
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,399
Grandmother!

190
00:09:15,399 --> 00:09:16,039
See how she

191
00:09:16,039 --> 00:09:17,360
She defies heaven itself!

192
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,000
No!

193
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,879
I'll have her expelled!

194
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,440
The Marquis residence

195
00:09:22,639 --> 00:09:23,720
Needs a new mistress!

196
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:31,000
Brother Xingxu!

197
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:34,639
Why are you in my room?

198
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,840
Brother Xingxu

199
00:09:38,039 --> 00:09:39,480
Sister Yuanzhi told me

200
00:09:40,039 --> 00:09:41,200
She wants to adopt me

201
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,559
As a sworn sister in this household

202
00:09:44,159 --> 00:09:45,399
Did you know this?

203
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:46,679
It was my decision

204
00:09:48,600 --> 00:09:49,360
I don't believe

205
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,639
How could we be siblings?

206
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,080
Since when

207
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,279
Do siblings love each other romantically?

208
00:09:55,639 --> 00:09:56,679
Why can't we?

209
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:59,080
What we had is long gone

210
00:10:00,159 --> 00:10:01,360
You'll marry someday

211
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,919
This status protects you

212
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,200
Within the residence

213
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,320
If not for cruel fate

214
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:11,600
We'd have confessed long ago

215
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:14,480
Lovers united at last

216
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,519
Shen Yuanzhi came later

217
00:10:19,960 --> 00:10:20,879
I know

218
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:22,799
You're responsible

219
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:24,440
Duty-bound

220
00:10:25,159 --> 00:10:26,639
Guilty toward her

221
00:10:29,159 --> 00:10:30,559
I'm willing

222
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,600
To share the husband with her

223
00:10:33,759 --> 00:10:35,080
Do you hear yourself?

224
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,720
Sharing one husband?

225
00:10:39,879 --> 00:10:41,159
This isn't you

226
00:10:41,879 --> 00:10:43,240
Who am I then?

227
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,879
Last night I watched you being intimate outside

228
00:10:48,559 --> 00:10:50,039
I felt myself going mad

229
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:54,840
Why did everything change

230
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,519
So suddenly?

231
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:03,480
Brother Xingxu

232
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,960
You still care for me, don't you?

233
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:09,440
You're just punishing me

234
00:11:09,879 --> 00:11:10,919
For rejecting you

235
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:11,879
Aren't you?

236
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:19,879
I've died once already

237
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,440
I won't lose you again

238
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:27,519
Fan Xingxu!

239
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,399
What are you doing?

240
00:11:32,919 --> 00:11:33,679
Engaging in debauchery in broad daylight?

241
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,159
It's not what you think

242
00:11:36,399 --> 00:11:37,840
Sister Yuanzhi, don't misunderstand

243
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,519
Brother Xingxu and I—

244
00:11:42,519 --> 00:11:44,200
We simply got carried away

245
00:11:46,559 --> 00:11:47,840
Sister, please don't hit me!

246
00:11:55,799 --> 00:11:56,679
Fan Xingxu!

247
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,320
Remember the oath you swore before me?

248
00:11:59,679 --> 00:12:01,120
Said you loved me forever

249
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:02,799
Vowed in this lifetime

250
00:12:03,080 --> 00:12:04,720
To marry only me, never take concubines

251
00:12:05,559 --> 00:12:06,559
If you broke this oath

252
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:08,120
May heavenly fire

253
00:12:08,440 --> 00:12:09,840
Burn your three souls and seven spirits!

254
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:11,519
May floods and quagmires

255
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:13,039
Sever your century of blessings!

256
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:14,799
Kin severed!

257
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:16,120
Life of solitude!

258
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,200
Scorned by man and beast for generations!

259
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:19,519
Cast into reincarnation—

260
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:20,360
Damned for eternity!

261
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:20,639
I...

262
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,320
Fan Xingxu!

263
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,200
If you loved another

264
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:25,120
Why deceive my sincere heart?

265
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,279
You—

266
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,080
I'll never forgive you!

267
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:30,480
Marquis!

268
00:12:30,679 --> 00:12:31,639
You've gone too far!

269
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:34,879
Brother Xingxu!

270
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:37,799
For her sake

271
00:12:39,519 --> 00:12:41,799
You swore such a vicious oath?

272
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:46,320
What you said earlier

273
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,200
I'll consider unheard

274
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,080
You saw it yourself

275
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,240
I won't fail her

276
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,120
Won't betray her trust

277
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:07,200
So...

278
00:13:09,759 --> 00:13:12,000
You choose to fail me?
