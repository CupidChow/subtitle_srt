1
00:00:53,119 --> 00:00:53,920
Grandmother

2
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,679
The manor has been unsettled lately

3
00:00:55,799 --> 00:00:56,600
Second brother—

4
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,159
And sister-in-law too

5
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,640
Keeps getting injured every other day

6
00:01:01,159 --> 00:01:02,000
Do you think

7
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:04,920
Our marquisate might truly be cursed like sister-in-law said

8
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,680
Under some kind of spell

9
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:08,879
What decent words could come from her mouth

10
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:10,640
She respects neither elders nor cares for juniors

11
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,400
She's a jinx herself

12
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,879
Yet drags our whole family down

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:16,239
If there truly is a curse

14
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,400
She's the one cursed

15
00:01:17,519 --> 00:01:18,599
Don't be angry

16
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:20,640
Sister Shen spoke in anger

17
00:01:22,879 --> 00:01:23,760
But

18
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:25,560
But what?

19
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,239
Within such a short time

20
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,680
So many misfortunes occurred

21
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:31,120
Truly an ominous sign

22
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:33,719
I heard from Yanjing Temple's master

23
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,359
In such cases

24
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,799
The whole family must

25
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:38,760
Go to the temple to copy sutras and pray

26
00:01:38,879 --> 00:01:40,640
Light eternal lamps to dispel misfortune

27
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:41,920
Really?

28
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,959
Can the master truly lift it?

29
00:01:44,519 --> 00:01:44,879
Mhm

30
00:01:44,959 --> 00:01:45,920
Oh grandmother

31
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,439
Better to believe than not

32
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:50,159
Let's visit Yanjing Temple

33
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,920
But your eldest brother may not agree

34
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,480
You talk with him properly

35
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:58,040
For your sake

36
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,599
He'll surely consent

37
00:02:00,239 --> 00:02:00,799
Be sure

38
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,519
To bring sister Shen too

39
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,159
The whole family

40
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,599
Not a single one missing

41
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,400
Well

42
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,439
Xingtong

43
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,719
This matter

44
00:02:10,719 --> 00:02:11,759
I entrust to you

45
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:13,000
Grandmother

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:13,759
My work

47
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:14,680
Won't disappoint you

48
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:29,240
Amitabha

49
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,639
Esteemed patrons

50
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,919
All is prepared

51
00:02:32,039 --> 00:02:32,960
Please follow me

52
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:23,560
So dizzy

53
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:39,560
This incense is wrong

54
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,319
Seal the temple gates

55
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,399
Eldest brother

56
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:21,920
What's happening?

57
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:23,399
Save me please

58
00:04:24,279 --> 00:04:25,519
We've been drugged

59
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:28,240
Temporarily paralyzed

60
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:30,439
We must wait for help

61
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,120
To arrive

62
00:04:32,279 --> 00:04:33,199
Such misfortune

63
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,240
Who holds such grudge against us?

64
00:04:39,079 --> 00:04:39,800
Second brother

65
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:40,720
Second brother

66
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:41,360
You captured us

67
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:42,199
Xingchen

68
00:04:42,319 --> 00:04:43,279
Release us now

69
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,959
We're family

70
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:46,279
Let's talk this through

71
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,800
What family?

72
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:50,079
The kind that shares joy

73
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,920
But leaves me to suffer alone

74
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,000
Second brother

75
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,360
How can you say that?

76
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,160
After what you did

77
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,120
Nearly doomed us all

78
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,759
How dare you blame us?

79
00:04:59,319 --> 00:05:00,199
Xingchen

80
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:02,160
Release us immediately

81
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,600
Don't compound your crimes

82
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,800
You're beyond redemption

83
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,800
Beyond redemption?

84
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,120
If you value your lives

85
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:09,959
Shut your mouths

86
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,680
Last time you escaped death

87
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,000
No one will save you now

88
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,759
Kill me if you will

89
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,120
Spare me your dramatics

90
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,959
I'm feeling generous today

91
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:25,639
Since you cling to life

92
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:26,720
I'll grant you a choice

93
00:05:26,879 --> 00:05:29,319
If only one of you two can live

94
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,199
Who will you choose?

95
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,600
Husband regarded as the god

96
00:05:39,279 --> 00:05:41,000
You should set store by overall interests

97
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,399
Sacrifice yourself for our house

98
00:05:43,959 --> 00:05:44,920
In time

99
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:47,879
I'll petition the emperor

100
00:05:48,279 --> 00:05:49,920
To grant you a posthumous title

101
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,040
A grand funeral

102
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,720
Enshrinement in the Fan ancestral hall

103
00:05:56,240 --> 00:05:57,000
Grandmother

104
00:05:57,839 --> 00:05:58,959
You overthink

105
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,000
Death extinguishes all

106
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,519
Trading a life

107
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:03,839
For posthumous glory

108
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,519
Why not enjoy riches while alive?

109
00:06:08,199 --> 00:06:09,160
Fan Xingxu

110
00:06:09,879 --> 00:06:11,000
In this world

111
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,079
I only truly love myself

112
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:14,800
You may blame me

113
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:16,680
But I have but one life

114
00:06:17,279 --> 00:06:18,639
I won't sacrifice it for you

115
00:06:19,079 --> 00:06:20,120
How shameless

116
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,319
Brother Xingxu treated you so well

117
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,680
Such a heartless creature

118
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:26,000
Brother Xingxu

119
00:06:26,279 --> 00:06:27,759
Can't you see her true nature?

120
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,240
If I chose

121
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:31,759
I'd choose you

122
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:33,399
For you

123
00:06:33,959 --> 00:06:35,319
I'd sacrifice everything

124
00:06:35,399 --> 00:06:36,240
Even my life

125
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:39,680
I'm the one who truly loves you

126
00:06:39,959 --> 00:06:40,319
Enough

127
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:42,560
Facing death

128
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:45,120
Yet still playing love-struck fools

129
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,079
Since she chose

130
00:06:47,959 --> 00:06:48,879
Now it's your turn

131
00:06:49,879 --> 00:06:52,319
If only one woman can live

132
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,560
Brother I'm curious

133
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,199
Who will you pick

134
00:06:59,079 --> 00:07:00,279
Your curiosity

135
00:07:00,279 --> 00:07:01,680
Is truly excessive

136
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:03,800
Do you find tormenting us amusing?

137
00:07:04,360 --> 00:07:06,199
Loose tongues invite disaster

138
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,959
Speak less to err less

139
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:10,600
Fan Xingchen

140
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,800
Your words

141
00:07:12,839 --> 00:07:14,319
Are truly detestable

142
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:15,959
You want my choice

143
00:07:21,439 --> 00:07:23,000
I choose neither

144
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,319
I choose you

145
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:29,519
I want your life

146
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,839
He Weilan

147
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,680
You heard him

148
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,920
He won't even lie to you

149
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:38,839
Still not giving up

150
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:39,759
Fan Xingchen

151
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:43,079
What is happening?

152
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:44,160
You know each other

153
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,639
Still can't see

154
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:48,399
They're accomplices

155
00:07:50,839 --> 00:07:52,040
Who are you really?

156
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:53,560
Why harm us?

157
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,399
Weilan

158
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,240
You're—

159
00:08:00,079 --> 00:08:00,680
No

160
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:02,759
Impossible

161
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,600
How utterly foolish

162
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,079
Isn't it obvious

163
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:20,639
You were right

164
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,360
Victory isn't in our hands

165
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:25,639
What are you talking about?

166
00:08:45,639 --> 00:08:46,559
Where are the others?

167
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,960
They're somewhere safe

168
00:08:54,080 --> 00:08:56,039
Finally just us two

169
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,960
We can talk properly now

170
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:00,200
From beginning to end

171
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:01,960
This was all your scheme

172
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,720
Fan Xingchen colluded with enemies

173
00:09:04,919 --> 00:09:05,879
Conspired with foreigners

174
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,840
You conspired with Fan Xingchen

175
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,759
You're a spy

176
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,519
What nonsense

177
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,360
I don't understand

178
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,320
No need

179
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:19,919
For pretense

180
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:22,279
Now that you've won

181
00:09:23,039 --> 00:09:24,879
Why not speak plainly？

182
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,240
You guessed correctly

183
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,519
So you faked death

184
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,679
For him

185
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,080
I needed to shed my spy identity

186
00:09:35,320 --> 00:09:37,279
To start anew

187
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:39,840
To stay by his side forever

188
00:09:40,919 --> 00:09:42,559
So you turned the tables

189
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:43,840
Exposed yourself deliberately

190
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:45,799
Let the Princess Nine target you

191
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:48,720
Made your handlers deem you useless

192
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,120
Wanting you silenced

193
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,000
No matter who struck

194
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,679
You could fake your death

195
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,879
So what if I did?

196
00:09:57,159 --> 00:09:58,840
I never meant harm

197
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,240
What clever scheming

198
00:10:03,039 --> 00:10:05,240
You knew Fan Xingxu's vengeful nature

199
00:10:05,759 --> 00:10:07,240
But didn't foresee his vengeance for you

200
00:10:10,799 --> 00:10:12,240
He's love-crazed

201
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,279
Hopelessly devoted to me

202
00:10:14,840 --> 00:10:16,120
Can't fault him for that

203
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,600
Such a pretty face

204
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:23,080
Would be a shame

205
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,120
To ruin it

206
00:10:25,879 --> 00:10:27,159
You're clever

207
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:29,240
We're both women

208
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,639
Life's hard enough

209
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,759
Help me out

210
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,440
Without you

211
00:10:37,759 --> 00:10:39,679
He'll return to his old self

212
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,000
What are you laughing at?

213
00:10:47,399 --> 00:10:49,279
Laughing at women binding each other

214
00:10:49,799 --> 00:10:52,279
With morality chains

215
00:10:53,159 --> 00:10:55,559
If you fear Fan Xingxu's wandering affections

216
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:56,559
Killing me

217
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,159
Is less effective than killing him

218
00:10:59,159 --> 00:11:00,399
Only the dead

219
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,639
Never change

220
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:04,720
Would you kill him?

221
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,360
My willingness matters little

222
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,320
What matters is

223
00:11:08,919 --> 00:11:10,840
Whether you'll lie to yourself forever

224
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:14,679
Rather than harm me

225
00:11:14,679 --> 00:11:16,200
For a fickle man

226
00:11:17,159 --> 00:11:19,120
Let me help you eliminate him

227
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:22,440
If you can't kill him

228
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:25,879
Castrate him

229
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:32,960
Interesting

230
00:11:33,399 --> 00:11:34,519
Truly fascinating

231
00:11:35,639 --> 00:11:37,519
No wonder he fell for you

232
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:40,360
Quite the character

233
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:43,080
Making me disappear

234
00:11:43,399 --> 00:11:45,120
Will only make him

235
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,240
Yearn more

236
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,480
Only by making him hate me

237
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:49,080
Despise me

238
00:11:49,879 --> 00:11:51,559
Will you feel secure

239
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,840
Don't think words will save you

240
00:11:57,080 --> 00:11:58,919
Your days are numbered

241
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:01,240
But rest assured

242
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,440
I've heard your counsel

243
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,840
If he truly

244
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,320
Pines for you after death

245
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,960
I'll send him to join you

246
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,480
How is it?

247
00:12:17,759 --> 00:12:18,879
Victory and defeat

248
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,440
Aren't decided here

249
00:12:20,799 --> 00:12:22,360
Nor in our hands

250
00:12:23,399 --> 00:12:24,279
Well

251
00:12:24,919 --> 00:12:26,159
Before I die

252
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,120
I'll grant you one wish

253
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:29,279
How is it?

254
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:36,360
What?

255
00:12:36,799 --> 00:12:37,960
You were a spy all along

256
00:12:58,159 --> 00:12:59,960
I was naive

257
00:13:01,559 --> 00:13:03,559
To think sincerity sufficed

258
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:08,879
But some things

259
00:13:10,360 --> 00:13:11,320
Require more

260
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,039
Than sincerity

261
00:13:15,879 --> 00:13:17,399
This "sincerity"

262
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,480
Is tainted

263
00:13:21,159 --> 00:13:23,360
I can't pretend otherwise

264
00:13:24,799 --> 00:13:25,720
He Weilan

265
00:13:26,679 --> 00:13:28,360
For our past acquaintance

266
00:13:28,759 --> 00:13:30,159
If you turn back now

267
00:13:30,159 --> 00:13:31,200
Come around

268
00:13:32,039 --> 00:13:33,720
I may spare your life

269
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,159
I've lost

270
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,480
As long as you breathe

271
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:52,919
You haven't truly lost

272
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,919
Such weakness

273
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,559
He Weilan

274
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,399
I've done what you asked

275
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,279
Since you won't kill him

276
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,600
I'll do it myself

277
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:07,679
Today you all die

278
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:08,840
Fan Xingchen

279
00:14:08,879 --> 00:14:09,480
You're insane

280
00:14:09,919 --> 00:14:11,480
He never meant to escape

281
00:14:12,879 --> 00:14:14,120
He wants us all dead

282
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:15,039
Second brother

283
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,240
Spare us

284
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:16,960
Die alone

285
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:17,840
Shut up

286
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:18,799
Why drag us down?

287
00:14:18,799 --> 00:14:19,639
Ah

288
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:26,200
You weren't drugged

289
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:27,000
How do you like

290
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,240
The show I prepared?

291
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:36,279
Release me

292
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,600
Or I kill her

293
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:40,639
I'll let you go

294
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,240
You can't harm her
