1
00:00:54,119 --> 00:00:55,359
Aren't you curious

2
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:57,240
about how your beloved

3
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,200
were killed?

4
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:05,079
You...

5
00:01:06,719 --> 00:01:07,879
No need to remind me.

6
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:09,480
You killed her.

7
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,799
Thank you

8
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:39,599
for today.

9
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:40,920
Thank me?

10
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,560
I always thought I was the only one

11
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,879
who saw through the truth.

12
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:48,400
You helped me.

13
00:01:48,599 --> 00:01:50,079
I realize how foolish I was.

14
00:01:50,599 --> 00:01:52,319
I took stories from books as reality,

15
00:01:52,480 --> 00:01:54,200
mistaking fish eyes for pearls.

16
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,760
I wasted my true feelings.

17
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,079
Love is like arsenic.

18
00:01:58,439 --> 00:01:59,640
You helped me see through it.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:00,799
Such a great favor

20
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,159
must be thanked.

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,560
You've given up

22
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:04,959
on love so quickly?

23
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:06,959
He betrayed me.

24
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,960
Why should I still care for him?

25
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:10,919
If I love him,

26
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,000
I'll love him till death.

27
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:14,680
If I don't love him,

28
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,120
I can let go of him

29
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:17,039
right away.

30
00:02:18,439 --> 00:02:20,439
You're really heartless.

31
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:23,680
I won't be the scapegoat anymore.

32
00:02:24,199 --> 00:02:25,599
You surrounded my house that day.

33
00:02:25,759 --> 00:02:27,159
He was about to take the imperial exam,

34
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,319
so he begged me

35
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,159
to take the blame for the carriage accident.

36
00:02:30,759 --> 00:02:31,680
He told me

37
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,599
that with my status as the daughter of a minister,

38
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:35,439
my father would surely protect me.

39
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,599
You admitted it before,

40
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:43,960
but now you're denying it.

41
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,560
You wanted to use me

42
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,199
to get back at your lover.

43
00:02:50,439 --> 00:02:51,800
Do you think I'm a fool?

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,520
I was blinded for a moment.

45
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:00,120
and made a wrong decision.

46
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:01,599
Now,

47
00:03:01,639 --> 00:03:03,000
it's not too late to set things right.

48
00:03:04,599 --> 00:03:05,800
If what I say is true,

49
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:07,840
can you afford to take the risk?

50
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:10,080
The enemy gets away with it,

51
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:11,520
and your loved one dies in vain.

52
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,159
Is this the revenge you've been longing for?

53
00:03:15,039 --> 00:03:16,240
If it were me,

54
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,199
I'd rather kill a thousand wrongly

55
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:20,159
than let one go.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:23,719
Yesterday's cause

57
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:25,039
Today's fruit...

58
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:27,800
Even if you talk a good game,

59
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,879
I won't believe a word of it.

60
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,039
The mission has already departed.

61
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,080
Soon,

62
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:57,879
they'll arrive in Bianjing.

63
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,159
Peace talks between the two states are imminent.

64
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:01,680
This is the best time

65
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:03,960
to reclaim lost territories without bloodshed

66
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:06,599
and take back ten states and counties.

67
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:11,960
Tell me.

68
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,159
Who sent the message to kill

69
00:04:15,479 --> 00:04:16,160
the mission?

70
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,120
I...

71
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:18,639
I don't know.

72
00:04:25,879 --> 00:04:27,040
We are all from Yan.

73
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,319
Don't make me look down on you.

74
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:32,360
I'll tell you.

75
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:32,920
I'll tell you.

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,560
I'll tell you.

77
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,680
I don't know who it is.

78
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,800
I only know

79
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:40,600
that tomorrow,

80
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:42,040
at Zuige Pavilion,

81
00:04:42,439 --> 00:04:43,199
that person

82
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,600
will give

83
00:04:44,839 --> 00:04:45,920
the final order.

84
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:48,480
Did you hear that?

85
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,120
Don't alert the enemy.

86
00:04:50,519 --> 00:04:51,560
I'll set it up now.

87
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,680
Fan Xingxu is cautious and sharp.

88
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,839
He is so smart that he is almost a demon.

89
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,560
What can I do

90
00:05:02,759 --> 00:05:04,040
to win his trust?

91
00:05:08,079 --> 00:05:09,160
I heard that

92
00:05:09,639 --> 00:05:10,439
my brother

93
00:05:10,519 --> 00:05:11,600
went to Zuige Pavilion.

94
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,800
But he never liked

95
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,480
going to those places before.

96
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:18,519
Oh.

97
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,480
I didn't expect

98
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:23,879
that after your sister-in-law came,

99
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:26,560
he changed his mind.

100
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,240
As the saying goes,

101
00:05:29,839 --> 00:05:30,759
if a woman

102
00:05:30,839 --> 00:05:31,800
is not capable,

103
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,560
her husband

104
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,680
will have affairs.

105
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,360
Zui Ge Pavillion?

106
00:05:38,839 --> 00:05:40,199
There must be a reason for this.

107
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,920
It's actually a chance for me.

108
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,000
Thanks for telling me.

109
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,160
I'll remember it.

110
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:48,240
What do you mean?

111
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:51,399
Now that I'm married into this family,

112
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:53,480
I'm the lady of the Wei Yuan Marquis's residence.

113
00:05:54,399 --> 00:05:56,000
If he won't let me live in peace,

114
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:58,680
I won't let him live in peace either.

115
00:06:01,920 --> 00:06:02,240
You...

116
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:02,879
You...

117
00:06:03,480 --> 00:06:04,759
Ah.

118
00:06:04,920 --> 00:06:06,319
She's really crazy.

119
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:08,160
Damn it!

120
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,480
You've been staring at me for so long.

121
00:07:41,839 --> 00:07:44,079
Aren't you afraid your bride will be upset?

122
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,120
What are you doing here?

123
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,240
You've been away from home for too long.

124
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,480
The Marquis's Mansion

125
00:08:04,759 --> 00:08:06,160
is not a fortress.

126
00:08:08,279 --> 00:08:09,199
As the saying goes,

127
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:11,360
money talks.

128
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:13,240
Besides,

129
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:15,240
just a wife who wants to know

130
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,639
where her husband has gone?

131
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:22,680
Stop acting crazy here.

132
00:08:25,439 --> 00:08:25,759
Fine.

133
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,120
I am going crazy.

134
00:08:27,639 --> 00:08:28,680
I love you so much,

135
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,160
but you've let me down.

136
00:08:30,920 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm telling you,

137
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:34,080
if you don't cut ties with that courtesan,

138
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,120
I'll die with you.

139
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:42,519
Fan Xingxu is investigating me very closely.

140
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,639
I'm afraid he has already...

141
00:08:56,279 --> 00:08:57,039
You...

142
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:06,039
I will catch you today.

143
00:09:06,559 --> 00:09:07,480
When you married me,

144
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,320
you said you would enjoy the moon and breeze together,

145
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,759
and never betray the deep affection in the mortal world.

146
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:12,200
When you had children for me

147
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:13,519
and managed the household affairs,

148
00:09:14,039 --> 00:09:15,000
you said you would only love me in this life,

149
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:15,960
and never betray me.

150
00:09:16,159 --> 00:09:17,639
Now, just three years later,

151
00:09:17,799 --> 00:09:19,320
staying at the Zuige Pavilion every night,

152
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:20,960
yet he refuses to look at me.

153
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:22,879
My dear,

154
00:09:23,879 --> 00:09:24,799
your heart

155
00:09:25,679 --> 00:09:26,840
is so cruel.

156
00:09:30,039 --> 00:09:30,720
My dear,

157
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,519
why do you do this to yourself?

158
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:34,240
Hush,

159
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,039
stop it.

160
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:37,200
The dancers at the Zuige Pavilion

161
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,080
can't compare to you.

162
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:49,279
Tell me,

163
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:51,600
what exactly do you want?

164
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:53,759
It's always pleasant

165
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:55,080
to talk to a smart person.

166
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,919
I can't find any evidence now,

167
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,360
but Gu Hengyuan is definitely not innocent.

168
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,639
If you want to avenge your dead lover,

169
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,360
you can't just target me.

170
00:10:06,759 --> 00:10:08,000
Even if

171
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:09,600
I and Gu Hengyuan

172
00:10:09,639 --> 00:10:10,600
are accomplices,

173
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:11,200
and co-conspirators,

174
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,320
that carriage was used for our secret meetings.

175
00:10:14,559 --> 00:10:16,159
If we hadn't colluded,

176
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:17,799
he wouldn't have distracted the stableman,

177
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,440
and there wouldn't have been

178
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:20,399
the incident of

179
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:21,679
killing people in the street.

180
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,320
My patience

181
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:24,840
is limited.

182
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,720
If you don't trust me,

183
00:10:27,159 --> 00:10:28,759
let me go to hell with him.

184
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:33,840
From a murderer

185
00:10:35,759 --> 00:10:37,320
You became a scapegoat,

186
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:42,320
and now you're an accomplice.

187
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,759
You're really willing to lie

188
00:10:51,799 --> 00:10:53,279
and do anything

189
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,480
to achieve your goal.

190
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,960
You can verify

191
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,360
what I said.

192
00:10:59,039 --> 00:11:01,200
He has the biggest weakness in your hands.

193
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:02,879
Why do you need my help?

194
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:06,559
As an ordinary woman,

195
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,279
it's too difficult for me

196
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,159
to seek justice without evidence.

197
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:13,039
But I'm so eager

198
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:15,399
to see the bad guy get his comeuppance.

199
00:11:16,519 --> 00:11:17,240
Can you

200
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,240
help me?
