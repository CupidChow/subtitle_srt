1
00:01:11,079 --> 00:01:12,480
You just said you like me

2
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,640
Why don't you even dare to look at me now?

3
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,879
I just remember what's in the book

4
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:18,200
Do not look at what is improper

5
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,280
Do not listen to what is improper

6
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:20,439
Do not do what is improper

7
00:01:24,480 --> 00:01:26,159
What you say and what you do

8
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:28,200
Are really different

9
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:32,599
I was wrong

10
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,200
How about

11
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,480
Let's discuss the details of our cooperation

12
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,959
That depends on your sincerity

13
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,920
What do you mean?

14
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:49,439
Well

15
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,000
A reception banquet?

16
00:01:59,359 --> 00:01:59,760
Yes

17
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:01,799
Fan Xingxu, together with several

18
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:03,439
Pro-peace ministers, persuaded the Emperor

19
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:05,040
to engage in peace talks

20
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,400
in the court

21
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,479
to reclaim the ten states and counties without war

22
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,879
This is the best opportunity

23
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,719
Your father

24
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,439
Minister Shen, is included

25
00:02:15,520 --> 00:02:16,520
I'm a woman

26
00:02:16,759 --> 00:02:17,560
So I don't know

27
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,879
The affairs of the court

28
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:20,000
Of course

29
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,800
The mission will arrive in Bianjing in a few days

30
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,840
Fan Xingxu will hold a reception banquet

31
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,319
For them at the Marquis's residence

32
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,919
I want you to do something for me

33
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:32,560
The poison in the bottle

34
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,039
is very toxic

35
00:02:34,039 --> 00:02:35,000
colorless and odorless

36
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,560
It's almost undetectable

37
00:02:37,919 --> 00:02:39,080
when mixed with wine

38
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,560
You just need to poison the envoy

39
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,039
with it

40
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:44,719
at the reception banquet

41
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,319
So

42
00:02:48,199 --> 00:02:49,360
you're really a spy?

43
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,520
I can't express my loyalty

44
00:02:52,759 --> 00:02:53,680
to you.

45
00:02:54,439 --> 00:02:55,800
It doesn't matter who I am

46
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,240
What matters is

47
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,759
I did everything for Yan

48
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:04,479
Afraid?

49
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:06,960
After the success

50
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,000
I will help you divorce Fan Xingxu

51
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,080
I hope you can keep your word

52
00:03:32,800 --> 00:03:33,960
You've come from afar

53
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:35,280
And toil

54
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:36,319
I propose

55
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:37,759
A toast to you all

56
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:39,520
Hoping for lasting peace

57
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,159
And prosperity

58
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:42,159
Between our nations

59
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,120
Thank you for your kind words

60
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:46,919
How did I not know

61
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,879
That the Wei Yuan Marquisate

62
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,360
Had changed hands?

63
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:53,240
A woman from the inner court

64
00:03:53,639 --> 00:03:55,960
Can speak so boldly in front of guests?

65
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,719
What do you mean by that?

66
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,520
Since I'm married

67
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,439
I'm the Marquise

68
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:04,120
I manage the major affairs

69
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,080
Oversee both internal and external matters

70
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,919
Mediate conflicts

71
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,560
And ensure the prosperity of the family

72
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,560
This naturally

73
00:04:08,719 --> 00:04:10,199
Includes treating guests with courtesy

74
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,000
Is there...

75
00:04:12,199 --> 00:04:13,319
Something wrong?

76
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:17,959
Marquis Wei Yuan,

77
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,759
You know how important it is

78
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,959
To have the envoys here

79
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:25,519
Aren't you afraid that she'll make a mistake

80
00:04:25,839 --> 00:04:27,199
And affect the negotiations?

81
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:30,199
Today is the reception banquet for the guests

82
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,079
Please, Your Highness

83
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:32,240
Keep the big picture in mind

84
00:04:32,439 --> 00:04:33,800
Don't let your personal grudge

85
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:35,360
And lost her royal grace

86
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:38,959
You are really sharp-tongued

87
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:44,040
Marquis

88
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:45,199
Is both honorable

89
00:04:45,439 --> 00:04:46,240
And a heavy responsibility

90
00:04:47,079 --> 00:04:48,160
This reception

91
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:50,879
Represents not only my family

92
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,879
But also the Great Yan

93
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,399
She manages the household well

94
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:56,720
And is courteous

95
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:59,639
I'm happy to have a rest

96
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,240
It seems that you are overthinking

97
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:10,879
You two

98
00:05:11,319 --> 00:05:13,199
Are really in harmony

99
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,160
And in one heart

100
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:17,639
Thank you for your praise

101
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,680
You are going to toast, right?

102
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,160
Don't keep the guests waiting

103
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:34,240
Please

104
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,040
May our friendship last forever

105
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:47,720
Envoy!

106
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,680
Envoy!

107
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:50,519
The wine

108
00:05:51,399 --> 00:05:52,279
Is poisoned!

109
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:00,879
Guards!

110
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,160
Shen Yuanzhi

111
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:14,240
How dare you?

112
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,639
Marquis Wei Yuan

113
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,319
She must be a spy from the enemy state

114
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,600
Sent to sabotage the peace talks

115
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:20,480
Arrest her now!

116
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:21,360
What?

117
00:06:21,639 --> 00:06:22,519
Spy?

118
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:23,680
Spy?

119
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:24,839
Princess,

120
00:06:25,399 --> 00:06:26,279
Don't talk nonsense

121
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:27,480
The priority is to find the doctor

122
00:06:27,480 --> 00:06:29,360
To treat the envoy

123
00:06:29,839 --> 00:06:31,040
Not to drag me in

124
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,000
I have evidence

125
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,839
Bring him here

126
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,319
I want to see

127
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,800
What evidence you have

128
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:49,240
If my wife is a spy

129
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:50,240
There are laws to be followed

130
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,000
I won't cover up

131
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,040
or hide her mistakes

132
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:03,040
You must have

133
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,519
Met this lady before

134
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,839
She's your wife's stepmother

135
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,480
She was framed

136
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:11,399
By Shen Yuanzhi

137
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,720
And expelled from the Shen residence

138
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,240
Lady Qin

139
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,240
Don't be afraid

140
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:17,360
Today

141
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:19,399
I will help you

142
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:20,879
Tell me

143
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,800
What you know

144
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:25,120
Her mother died early

145
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:26,519
Her father

146
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:27,959
Remarried me

147
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,360
I always treat her

148
00:07:30,839 --> 00:07:33,199
as my own daughter

149
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:34,720
I didn't expect

150
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,439
She feared my child

151
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,160
To steal her favor

152
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:41,439
So she secretly

153
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,920
Gave me and other concubines

154
00:07:44,519 --> 00:07:46,360
The contraceptive soup

155
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:48,000
Making us unable to

156
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:50,680
Have children

157
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,920
Even if you're telling the truth

158
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:54,920
These are just

159
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:57,079
Private matters of the harem

160
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,759
How does that relate to

161
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,839
the murder of the envoy?

162
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:00,759
Shut up!

163
00:08:01,279 --> 00:08:03,040
You don't have the right to speak here

164
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,839
After she kicked me out of the Shen family

165
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:10,040
I secretly observed her

166
00:08:10,120 --> 00:08:12,839
I found she was frequently in close contact

167
00:08:12,839 --> 00:08:14,199
With some suspicious individuals

168
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,759
These people are not from Yan

169
00:08:17,279 --> 00:08:18,600
Before the reception banquet

170
00:08:18,839 --> 00:08:20,079
I saw them

171
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,839
Exchanging some items in private

172
00:08:23,279 --> 00:08:25,759
It must be related to the assassination of the envoy

173
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,480
Shen Yuanzhi

174
00:08:28,959 --> 00:08:30,519
What more can you say?

175
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:31,639
Nonsense!

176
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:33,600
I have a grudge with this person

177
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,480
Don't believe her

178
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:37,720
Besides this so-called witness

179
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:39,200
Do you have any physical evidence?

180
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:42,240
You don't

181
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:43,480
I do

182
00:08:53,559 --> 00:08:54,720
The evidence is right here

183
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,200
The wine is poisoned

184
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,120
The poisoner wanted to kill me

185
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,440
Not the envoy

186
00:08:59,919 --> 00:09:01,039
You say the wine is poisoned?

187
00:09:02,039 --> 00:09:03,600
When I was going to toast

188
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:05,679
I was interrupted by Princess Nine

189
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:07,720
I mistakenly took the envoy's wine glass

190
00:09:08,639 --> 00:09:09,480
And he

191
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:12,120
Was poisoned after drinking the wine I should have drunk

192
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,399
So I dare to say that

193
00:09:14,639 --> 00:09:16,200
The poisoner wanted to kill me

194
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,840
But

195
00:09:17,960 --> 00:09:19,960
But accidentally harmed others

196
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,000
So

197
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,559
To avoid suspicion

198
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:24,440
