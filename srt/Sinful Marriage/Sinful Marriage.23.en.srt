1
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:25,159
You're awake

2
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:27,040
Mm

3
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,719
Are you shy?

4
00:01:31,599 --> 00:01:32,920
Last night you were so bold

5
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:34,680
Now you're embarrassed

6
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,560
I am not

7
00:01:38,359 --> 00:01:39,239
It was you—

8
00:01:39,239 --> 00:01:40,000
What was me?

9
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:55,280
It's broad daylight

10
00:01:55,799 --> 00:01:57,200
Aren't you afraid others will mock you?

11
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,120
Saying you're—

12
00:02:00,319 --> 00:02:01,439
Saying what?
Blinded by passion

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,079
Indulging in pleasure

14
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,439
No need to worry, Madam

15
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:10,360
They'll only say you're—

16
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:11,680
Exceptionally talented

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,400
Excellent at managing your husband

18
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:17,479
That's why I'm utterly enchanted

19
00:02:18,199 --> 00:02:19,280
Unable to restrain myself

20
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:28,919
Ahem—

21
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:29,840
Marquis

22
00:02:30,520 --> 00:02:31,120
Marquis

23
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,680
This better be important

24
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:34,080
An invitation from the palace

25
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:35,919
Requesting all noblewomen of the Marquis household

26
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,800
To attend a gathering

27
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,800
The Empress Dowager

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,599
Princess Nine's birth mother

29
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,039
Understood

30
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,000
Dismissed

31
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,080
Yes

32
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:52,960
Stay at the estate

33
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:54,639
I'll handle this

34
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:56,719
As an official's wife

35
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,400
I should attend court ceremonies

36
00:02:58,479 --> 00:02:59,199
But—

37
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:00,560
Don't worry

38
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:02,000
I know your concerns

39
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,680
But you can't guard against thieves forever

40
00:03:03,759 --> 00:03:05,080
Only catch them daily

41
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,479
You can't protect me always

42
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,400
I'll act according to circumstances

43
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:12,159
Fine

44
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,639
After the banquet

45
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,919
I'll come to the palace for you

46
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:15,919
Mm

47
00:03:37,719 --> 00:03:38,280
Sis-in-law

48
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:40,080
It's been so long since I entered the palace

49
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,479
If grandmother weren't unwell

50
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:43,280
Otherwise

51
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,240
She'd have joined us

52
00:03:45,039 --> 00:03:46,039
The physician examined her

53
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:48,000
No serious issues

54
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:48,719
Don't worry

55
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:51,759
Today is my birthday celebration

56
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,120
I wished for some liveliness

57
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:56,199
Treat it as a family feast

58
00:03:56,199 --> 00:03:57,240
A simple gathering

59
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:58,360
Everyone

60
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,680
May relax formalities

61
00:03:59,719 --> 00:04:00,120
Mm

62
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,759
Sis-in-law

63
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:09,639
You must eat more

64
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:10,960
Imperial kitchen dishes

65
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,080
Are rarely tasted otherwise

66
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,639
Put food in your bowl

67
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:14,680
But don't eat it

68
00:04:14,919 --> 00:04:15,520
Pretend to

69
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:16,800
Don't touch the wine

70
00:04:17,800 --> 00:04:18,560
Don't ask why

71
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:26,680
Ah

72
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,079
Forgive me

73
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,639
I didn't mean to

74
00:04:29,639 --> 00:04:30,759
I didn't mean to

75
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:32,000
How careless

76
00:04:32,519 --> 00:04:34,199
To offend the Marquis's wife

77
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:36,319
Take her to change clothes immediately

78
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,720
Empress Dowager

79
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:38,639
I am unharmed

80
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,279
Just a few drops of wine

81
00:04:40,680 --> 00:04:42,000
Don't disrupt the festivities

82
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,079
I'll change at home later

83
00:04:45,279 --> 00:04:46,519
Graceful and poised

84
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,839
Unflustered in crisis

85
00:04:48,519 --> 00:04:49,720
Marquis Weiyuan

86
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:52,480
Truly married well

87
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:52,879
Ah

88
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:54,680
Thank you for your praise

89
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:56,839
Then be seated

90
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:58,680
My gratitude

91
00:05:00,519 --> 00:05:01,279
Sis-in-law

92
00:05:01,519 --> 00:05:02,879
Why didn't you change clothes？

93
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:03,759
Shh

94
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:35,920
Something's wrong

95
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:37,680
There's a problem here

96
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,199
Marquise Weiyuan

97
00:05:39,519 --> 00:05:41,360
How about the music?

98
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,720
If you enjoy it

99
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,439
Listen carefully

100
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:56,800
You've been hard to find

101
00:05:57,439 --> 00:05:58,319
Fan Xingxu

102
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,360
You're haunting like a ghost

103
00:06:01,639 --> 00:06:02,480
Those words

104
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,439
You should say to yourself

105
00:06:06,439 --> 00:06:07,519
Surrender now

106
00:06:07,839 --> 00:06:08,839
Save the trouble

107
00:06:09,519 --> 00:06:10,480
Fan Xingxu

108
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,879
You have time to chase me

109
00:06:13,399 --> 00:06:15,120
Shen Yuanzhi should be at the palace now

110
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:16,879
Attending the Empress Dowager's banquet

111
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:19,040
How do you know?

112
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,079
I also know

113
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:21,959
If you don't hurry up

114
00:06:22,879 --> 00:06:24,720
She'll soon die

115
00:06:32,920 --> 00:06:34,040
Say that again

116
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:36,600
I said your beloved will soon die

117
00:06:37,319 --> 00:06:39,240
You'll live in regret forever

118
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,079
Loving what you cannot have

119
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,839
What's wrong with the Marquise?

120
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:04,560
You look rather pale

121
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:11,240
I apologize for my discourtesy

122
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:12,680
The wine overpowers me

123
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,120
I'm afraid

124
00:07:14,399 --> 00:07:15,560
I must take my leave early

125
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,759
Oh

126
00:07:17,839 --> 00:07:19,519
Don't rush to leave yet

127
00:07:19,639 --> 00:07:20,959
I'll summon the imperial physician

128
00:07:21,279 --> 00:07:22,879
To examine you for reassurance

129
00:07:23,519 --> 00:07:24,519
Thank you, Empress Dowager

130
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:25,560
Unnecessary

131
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:27,439
I bid you farewell

132
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:29,519
Xingtong

133
00:07:33,079 --> 00:07:35,040
The Fan family harbors ill intentions

134
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:36,639
Smuggling weapons into the palace

135
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:37,800
To assassinate me

136
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,639
Seize them

137
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:39,279
I'll kill you

138
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,360
The music is abnormal

139
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,040
Something at this banquet

140
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,199
Is driving people mad

141
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,040
Still making excuses

142
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,319
Kill them

143
00:07:45,920 --> 00:07:47,319
I'll kill you all

144
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:51,120
Whether I speak truth

145
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,839
An investigation will reveal

146
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,279
Why is the Empress Dowager so eager to kill us?

147
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:54,519
To silence witnesses?

148
00:07:54,959 --> 00:07:57,399
Audacious Shen Yuanzhi

149
00:07:57,399 --> 00:07:58,839
Today you must die

150
00:07:59,120 --> 00:07:59,519
Quick

151
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:00,279
Kill her

152
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,160
With me here

153
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:06,160
Who dares touch her?

154
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:09,920
Yuanzhi

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,319
Xingtong and I are affected

156
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,120
Marquis Weiyuan

157
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,639
Is your entire Fan family

158
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:23,879
Plotting rebellion?

159
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:25,639
The rebel

160
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:26,839
Is you

161
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:28,480
You're insane

162
00:08:28,839 --> 00:08:30,040
Daring to accuse me

163
00:08:30,600 --> 00:08:32,000
Think carefully yourself

164
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:33,799
What exactly have you done?

165
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:35,559
Treason

166
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,120
All rebels

167
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:38,039
Quick

168
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:39,759
Kill them all

169
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,080
Empress Dowager

170
00:08:45,919 --> 00:08:46,399
No—

171
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:48,799
The real Empress Dowager

172
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:49,799
Was killed by you

173
00:08:55,240 --> 00:08:57,080
Let's make a trade

174
00:08:57,919 --> 00:08:59,440
I'll tell you a secret

175
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:01,159
You release me

176
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,840
You're in no position to bargain

177
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:09,120
Don't you want to save Shen Yuanzhi?

178
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,440
Don't play tricks

179
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,159
The Empress Dowager's revenge

180
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,159
Against you

181
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,919
Isn't for the Princess Nine

182
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,960
She's one of us

183
00:09:24,679 --> 00:09:26,639
She's not the real Empress Dowager

184
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:41,279
Marquis

185
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:42,960
Go

186
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,639
Yes

187
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,759
With mere words

188
00:09:50,879 --> 00:09:52,720
You dare frame me

189
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:53,399
Hmph

190
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,679
Three years ago

191
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,840
The Empress Dowager went to Yanjing Temple

192
00:09:56,919 --> 00:09:58,440
Returned gravely ill

193
00:09:58,559 --> 00:09:59,279
Rarely seen since

194
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,000
I've already reported to His Majesty

195
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:03,200
Sent men to investigate

196
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,559
You resemble her by eighty percent

197
00:10:57,799 --> 00:11:00,000
Exploited her long stays at Yanjing Temple

198
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:01,759
To observe and mimic her

199
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:03,919
Until no one could tell

200
00:11:03,919 --> 00:11:05,320
Then fully replaced her

201
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:06,960
The real Empress Dowager

202
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,240
Was killed by you three years ago

203
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:10,720
Marquis

204
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:11,720
The corpse has been found

205
00:11:14,639 --> 00:11:16,840
The real Empress Dowager's corpse is recovered

206
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,559
Yanjing Temple was an enemy spy base

207
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:23,559
Evidence is conclusive

208
00:11:24,879 --> 00:11:26,320
By His Majesty's decree

209
00:11:26,679 --> 00:11:28,000
All traitors are to be arrested

210
00:11:31,919 --> 00:11:33,440
Three years of planning

211
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:35,240
Destroyed overnight

212
00:11:36,759 --> 00:11:39,200
With such generals in Yan

213
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,600
Its fate remains unbroken

214
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:44,279
What is fate?

215
00:11:44,799 --> 00:11:45,720
It has a long history

216
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,759
In the world

217
00:11:46,919 --> 00:11:48,159
Who dares predict downfall?

218
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,480
Yan's foundations are deep

219
00:11:50,679 --> 00:11:51,480
Its fortune surges

220
00:11:51,919 --> 00:11:52,840
To destroy it

221
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,519
Is a fool's delusion

222
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,039
Abandon this madness

223
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:57,879
Take them away
