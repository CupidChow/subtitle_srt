1
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:57,960
Her identity is fake

2
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,479
Her name

3
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,679
Her identity

4
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,920
Her past

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,560
Everything I knew

6
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:07,640
Was false

7
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:09,640
The letter

8
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:10,879
Failed to uncover her true identity

9
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:14,159
Perhaps she has unspeakable reasons

10
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:15,840
Forcing her to hide

11
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:19,000
If that's the case

12
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,000
My men would've uncovered it

13
00:01:22,120 --> 00:01:24,239
Whoever forged her identity is no simpleton

14
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:26,560
Before

15
00:01:27,599 --> 00:01:29,239
I thought her just an ordinary orphan girl

16
00:01:29,879 --> 00:01:31,000
Never doubted her

17
00:01:32,319 --> 00:01:33,400
You mean

18
00:01:34,239 --> 00:01:35,439
She might be--

19
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:36,560
Nine times out of ten

20
00:01:40,760 --> 00:01:42,319
That saying "The wise avoid love's river"

21
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:43,480
Is absolutely right

22
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,519
No matter how clever you think you are

23
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:47,000
Once you lose yourself

24
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,079
In loving another

25
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,239
Tragedy is inevitable

26
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,879
You and I

27
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:52,560
Have been equally foolish

28
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,760
In this matter

29
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,680
You're right

30
00:01:58,840 --> 00:01:59,640
I was careless

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,920
So now

32
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:04,879
What's your plan？

33
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,680
Wait

34
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:09,759
Wait for the truth to surface

35
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,159
Come take a look come take a look

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:32,680
Hey

37
00:02:32,759 --> 00:02:33,840
My purse

38
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,759
Xingtong
My purse

39
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:39,840
Ling'er

40
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:41,919
So it is you

41
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,840
What are you talking about?

42
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:47,199
What Ling'er?

43
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,280
I had an accident recently

44
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,360
Lost my memory

45
00:02:51,719 --> 00:02:53,120
Remember nothing

46
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,439
I'm not Fan Xingxu

47
00:02:56,199 --> 00:02:58,199
Don't put on that pretentious act with me

48
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,759
If you don't want him knowing who you are

49
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,039
Better stop playing dumb with me

50
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,400
If I recall correctly

51
00:03:16,719 --> 00:03:17,759
You are now

52
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,280
A wanted criminal by the court

53
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:23,159
If I were you

54
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,800
Rather than seeking old acquaintances here

55
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,039
You'd better find a way

56
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,400
To leave early

57
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,719
You the top spy haven't left

58
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:36,800
Why should I go?

59
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,840
Ling'er is dead

60
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:45,759
I truly don't understand

61
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,080
What charm does Fan Xingxu possess?

62
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:51,280
Makes you all flock to him like this

63
00:03:51,639 --> 00:03:53,319
You feigned death for him

64
00:03:54,039 --> 00:03:55,599
Abandoned your spy identity

65
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:57,759
Tell me

66
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:00,080
Seeking me out

67
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,840
What do you want?

68
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,199
Help me leave Great Yan

69
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,560
I'll keep your secret

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:12,120
So it's not that you don't want to run

71
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,919
But that you can't

72
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:16,839
Don't worry

73
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,160
I didn't say no

74
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,560
However

75
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,920
You must help me with something first

76
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:25,839
What is it?

77
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:28,439
Kill someone

78
00:04:29,519 --> 00:04:31,759
We both despise deeply

79
00:04:37,279 --> 00:04:38,160
I agree

80
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,680
Weilan

81
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:44,399
Weilan

82
00:04:45,079 --> 00:04:45,800
Weilan

83
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,279
Oh Weilan

84
00:04:48,279 --> 00:04:49,160
What are you doing here?

85
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:50,839
That person seemed...

86
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,800
You ran too fast earlier

87
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,240
I couldn't catch up

88
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:55,000
What about that thief?

89
00:04:55,319 --> 00:04:55,800
Whew

90
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,879
Luckily I chased fast

91
00:04:57,240 --> 00:04:57,879
He dropped the purse

92
00:04:57,879 --> 00:04:59,000
Midway through running

93
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:01,759
It's unsafe outside

94
00:05:01,879 --> 00:05:02,959
Let's hurry go back

95
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:05,040
You're right

96
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:05,759
Let's go

97
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,839
Zuige Pavilion

98
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,279
Why is she here?

99
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,199
Marquis

100
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:50,560
You're finally back

101
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:51,519
What happened？

102
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,279
Miss

103
00:05:52,439 --> 00:05:53,040
No

104
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,079
Madam

105
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,319
She told me to tell you

106
00:05:55,439 --> 00:05:56,560
If she doesn't return within an hour

107
00:05:56,759 --> 00:05:57,920
Something must have happened？

108
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Told me I must find you

109
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:32,800
It's you

110
00:06:33,079 --> 00:06:34,199
Long time no see

111
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,199
My dear sister-in-law

112
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:39,199
You thought I'd die so easily by your and Fan Xingxu's hands

113
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:41,040
Making a fool of me before

114
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,040
Must've been amusing for you

115
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,279
So

116
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:46,160
You want revenge

117
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,360
Yes

118
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:50,560
Those who cross me meet no good end

119
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,319
Guess

120
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,519
What I'll do to you？

121
00:06:56,839 --> 00:06:58,519
I overestimated you before

122
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,240
You're just a coward

123
00:07:01,319 --> 00:07:02,439
Even revenge

124
00:07:02,839 --> 00:07:04,600
You only dare pick on soft targets like me

125
00:07:05,439 --> 00:07:06,879
Why not go after Fan Xingxu？

126
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:07,800
After all

127
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,040
He should be the one you hate most

128
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:10,920
Shut up

129
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:13,920
I'll send you off first

130
00:07:14,480 --> 00:07:16,360
You'll reunite in the underworld soon enough

131
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:46,680
Grab her

132
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,360
What are you doing？

133
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,199
Watch where you're going

134
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:49,399
Let me go

135
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:50,399
Let me go

136
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,079
You wench

137
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,839
Since you've sold yourself to Zuige pavilion

138
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,199
Stop thinking of running away

139
00:07:55,399 --> 00:07:56,279
Take her back

140
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,639
As long as you serve the gentlemen well

141
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,199
Let me go
As long as you serve the gentlemen well

142
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:01,319
These banknotes are all yours

143
00:08:01,439 --> 00:08:02,120
Come back next time

144
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:04,759
Ah

145
00:08:04,839 --> 00:08:05,680
My banknotes

146
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:07,519
Are you crazy？

147
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:08,879
Ah

148
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:09,920
You

149
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,279
You all saw it

150
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,279
She tore my banknotes

151
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,120
She must compensate me

152
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:15,240
Torn is torn

153
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,199
Go report it to the authorities

154
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:17,319
How preposterous

155
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:18,160
Just you wait

156
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,399
Come with me to the yamen now

157
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:20,279
Move

158
00:08:20,279 --> 00:08:21,040
Esteemed guest

159
00:08:21,160 --> 00:08:21,959
Apologies

160
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,000
This girl just arrived

161
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,040
Doesn't know better

162
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:24,959
Still being trained

163
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:25,879
I don't care about that

164
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,360
She tore my banknotes

165
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,439
And had the audacity to...

166
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,120
I must report this

167
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:30,360
Guest

168
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:30,680
Go report it then

169
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,800
I'm not afraid of you

170
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:32,559
Enough

171
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:36,759
Enough

172
00:08:36,879 --> 00:08:37,879
Disperse everyone

173
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,559
Let me go

174
00:08:52,879 --> 00:08:54,360
Meant to torment you longer

175
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:56,600
But I've changed my mind

176
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,720
For a woman like you

177
00:08:59,320 --> 00:09:00,720
Killing should be swift

178
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,759
Leaving you alive another moment

179
00:09:04,039 --> 00:09:06,279
May cost me the perfect chance

180
00:09:16,679 --> 00:09:17,399
Shen Yuanzhi

181
00:09:17,879 --> 00:09:18,639
Shen Yuanzhi

182
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,159
Shen Yuanzhi wake up

183
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:21,840
Shen Yuanzhi

184
00:09:22,519 --> 00:09:23,559
Shen Yuanzhi wake up

185
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,279
I forbid you to die

186
00:09:25,759 --> 00:09:26,720
You can't die

187
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,000
Shen Yuanzhi

188
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:30,799
Shen Yuanzhi

189
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,000
Wake up for me

190
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,559
You

191
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:37,000
If you don't let me go

192
00:09:39,559 --> 00:09:41,000
I really will die

193
00:09:46,759 --> 00:09:47,600
I'm sorry

194
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,039
I came too late
