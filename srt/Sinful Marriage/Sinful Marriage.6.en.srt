1
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:05,319
You're awake.

2
00:01:05,319 --> 00:01:06,319
Miss,

3
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,719
were you kidnapped by them too?

4
00:01:12,680 --> 00:01:13,400
Them?

5
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:15,519
We now hold his brother and wife

6
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:16,680
captive.

7
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:18,159
It's easy to deal with

8
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,680
Fan Xingxu.

9
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:21,480
You're so wise.

10
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:22,760
Keep an eye on them.

11
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:25,000
You are?

12
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:36,840
I've been studying away.

13
00:01:37,319 --> 00:01:39,359
I heard about your wedding

14
00:01:39,879 --> 00:01:41,200
and rushed back to celebrate.

15
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,040
Unfortunately, I was ambushed outside the city

16
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:46,319
and captured by these bandits.

17
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,599
You are

18
00:01:49,959 --> 00:01:52,439
the Shen family's eldest daughter

19
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,599
whom my brother is marrying, Shen Yuanzhi, right?

20
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:55,319
Yes.

21
00:01:57,719 --> 00:01:58,239
Brother-in-law,

22
00:01:58,480 --> 00:01:59,959
no time for courtesies now.

23
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,560
Do me a favor.

24
00:02:41,719 --> 00:02:42,120
Where are they?

25
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:42,639
They...

26
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:43,719
They're gone.

27
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:49,199
Go.

28
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,120
Get up.

29
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,680
Leave me alone.

30
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,479
Get out of here.

31
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:06,360
Go report to the authorities.

32
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,039
But...

33
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,159
Hurry up!

34
00:03:24,639 --> 00:03:25,560
Who are you?

35
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:27,120
Why do you arrest me?

36
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:30,000
You should blame your good husband.

37
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:30,680
Don't worry.

38
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:31,479
I'll

39
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,919
kill you quickly.

40
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:35,199
So what?

41
00:03:35,719 --> 00:03:37,159
Even couples abandon each other in calamity!

42
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,719
Every wrong has its cause.

43
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,759
If Fan Xingxu killed someone or set a fire,

44
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:41,879
you can find him.

45
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,120
Even if he is cut into pieces, it's his fate.

46
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,759
I'm innocent.

47
00:03:45,919 --> 00:03:46,520
If you let me go,

48
00:03:46,639 --> 00:03:47,919
we can talk about any terms.

49
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,919
You cherish your life.

50
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:51,759
In this world,

51
00:03:52,039 --> 00:03:53,919
nothing is more important than one's own life.

52
00:03:54,199 --> 00:03:55,479
Let alone just a man.

53
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,919
If you think

54
00:03:57,080 --> 00:03:58,439
killing me will make him suffer,

55
00:03:58,759 --> 00:03:59,879
you're gravely mistaken.

56
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,039
He's

57
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:02,400
paranoid and arrogant,

58
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:03,599
and incapable of love.

59
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,159
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:05,479 --> 00:04:07,439
No matter how eloquent you are,

61
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,840
you'll die here today.

62
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:10,560
My Lord,

63
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:13,159
with the Marquise as bait

64
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,079
I'm sure Fan Xingxu will come.

65
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:16,879
Then,

66
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,879
we'll lure him into a trap

67
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:19,720
and

68
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,120
kill him.

69
00:04:24,199 --> 00:04:25,120
What are you laughing at?

70
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,560
Fan Xingxu sees me as an enemy

71
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,800
and wishes me dead.

72
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,600
Using me as bait

73
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,480
is useless.

74
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:33,759
If we could kill him,

75
00:04:34,319 --> 00:04:35,839
I'm the first to thank you.

76
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,600
Although I'm late,

77
00:04:53,319 --> 00:04:54,879
you suffered some pain.

78
00:04:56,079 --> 00:04:57,560
You can't blame me for that.

79
00:04:58,759 --> 00:04:59,639
You have to trust me.

80
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:01,480
Fan Xingxu

81
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,319
You are so arrogant.

82
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:04,959
You really come alone.

83
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,639
She is my only wife.

84
00:05:09,319 --> 00:05:10,199
No matter what,

85
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,480
I will save her.

86
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,680
What do you want?

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,879
I'll do anything

88
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:16,040
I can.

89
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:17,560
But the only condition

90
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:19,399
is that you can't hurt her.

91
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,319
What do I want?

92
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,720
I want to kill you.

93
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:42,720
If you let me go now,

94
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:43,720
you might still live.

95
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:45,160
Taking me as a hostage

96
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:46,160
will only lead to your death.

97
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,519
Shut up.

98
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:48,639
Let her go.

99
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:49,920
I can let you go.

100
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:50,639
Fan Xingxu

101
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,680
If you come closer, I'll kill her.

102
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,160
Trade your life for hers.

103
00:05:57,399 --> 00:05:58,160
OK.

104
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,560
Don't listen to him.

105
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,759
He's just playing with you.

106
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:01,480
Shut up.

107
00:06:02,399 --> 00:06:03,920
You've really broken my heart.

108
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:04,560
My dear,

109
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:06,439
I've been sincere to you,

110
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,879
but you treat me like a rag.

111
00:06:11,839 --> 00:06:13,240
It's your fault.

112
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:38,399
My dear,

113
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,439
I avoided the vital parts.

114
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:41,920
Don't worry.

115
00:06:42,079 --> 00:06:42,959
You won't die.

116
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:45,759
You did it on purpose?

117
00:06:46,959 --> 00:06:48,040
You liar!

118
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:49,560
My Lord,

119
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,560
we've got some information

120
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,399
from the bait we set.

121
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:53,040
Fan Xingxu,

122
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:53,959
let me go!

123
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:55,079
I have evidence

124
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:57,639
that He Weilan's death was not an accident.

125
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:01,279
You think this horse is completely mad?

126
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:01,759
Yes.

127
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:02,040
Miss,

128
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:04,240
since the last time you rode it in the street,

129
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:06,160
the horse has become extremely difficult to control.

130
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:07,839
It often neighs and strikes.

131
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,439
I've consulted a doctor,

132
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,759
but he couldn't find any issues.

133
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:13,000
In a few days,

134
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:13,720
this horse

135
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,199
will be killed.

136
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,319
Before you rode it,

137
00:07:17,600 --> 00:07:19,079
It never looked strange.

138
00:07:19,959 --> 00:07:20,560
No.

139
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:24,120
Could it be caused by an injury?

140
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,800
I've checked it inside and out.

141
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,360
There are no wounds.

142
00:07:29,519 --> 00:07:30,120
Bring me some wine.

143
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:31,560
Yes, Miss.

144
00:07:43,879 --> 00:07:44,600
Whoa.

145
00:07:45,079 --> 00:07:45,839
I found it.

146
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,399
Miss.

147
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:48,959
This...

148
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,040
Who the hell did this?

149
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,319
The place where the horse went mad

150
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,360
is the best place to start.

151
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,079
The position on the second floor that day

152
00:08:02,279 --> 00:08:03,480
was originally booked by a customer.

153
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,000
Then a few people came

154
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:05,800
and insisted on sitting there.

155
00:08:05,839 --> 00:08:07,199
They almost got into a fight.

156
00:08:07,279 --> 00:08:08,720
In the end, it cost three times the price

157
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:09,800
to get that position.

158
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,800
Do you remember what those people looked like?

159
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:14,319
Ah.

160
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:15,199
Hmm.

161
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:16,560
Round face.

162
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,079
A bit of a mustache.

163
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,759
Based on the shopkeeper's confession,

164
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,800
I sketched a portrait.

165
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:25,600
The person in the painting

166
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,959
resembles the young man in blue

167
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,920
you chased at Zuige Pavilion that day.

168
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:32,000
These people have been targeting you.

169
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,759
The carriage just happened to pass by.

170
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:36,039
Even if it wasn't Shen's carriage,

171
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,000
it would be Zhang's carriage

172
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:37,519
or Li's carriage.

173
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:38,799
In the whole matter,

174
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:39,840
I'm the only one

175
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,320
who is the real victim.

176
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,120
He Weilan was killed by you.

177
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,720
Do you think I'll believe you

178
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:55,159
just because you say so?

179
00:08:56,879 --> 00:08:58,120
Don't forget

180
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:00,600
you just tried to harm me.

181
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,039
I know you won't believe me.

182
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,840
That's why I had to

183
00:09:04,960 --> 00:09:05,919
try this move.

184
00:09:06,960 --> 00:09:08,240
Now that this path is blocked,

185
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,919
I must try other ways.

186
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:11,360
You can verify

187
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,639
what I said today.

188
00:09:13,639 --> 00:09:14,799
No need to bother.

189
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,360
There's an opportunity now.

190
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:19,279
What opportunity?

191
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,480
to use you as bait.

192
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:35,720
I never promised to protect you

193
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,120
or keep you safe.

194
00:09:37,679 --> 00:09:38,559
How could that be deception?

195
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:40,039
Brother,

196
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,159
you're injured.

197
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:44,960
Brother,

198
00:09:45,559 --> 00:09:46,600
your wife is seriously injured.

199
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,759
She shouldn't move around.

200
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:49,320
It'll aggravate her wounds.

201
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:55,679
You're out of line, aren't you?

202
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:57,879
I'll take care of

203
00:09:58,679 --> 00:09:59,919
my wife.
