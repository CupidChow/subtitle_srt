1
00:00:58,600 --> 00:00:59,200
Miss

2
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:00,280
Don't catch a chill

3
00:01:02,560 --> 00:01:04,000
Don't call me Miss anymore

4
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,000
I don't want anyone finding fault with us

5
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,159
Yes

6
00:01:08,519 --> 00:01:09,359
Madam

7
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,439
Don't worry

8
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:12,599
Soon you'll be able to call me that again

9
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,719
But now

10
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:15,920
I have a problem

11
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,359
I'm not sure how to solve it

12
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,719
What problem?

13
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,319
When two tigers fight

14
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,359
How can the hunter

15
00:01:23,480 --> 00:01:25,120
Be sure to profit?

16
00:01:25,879 --> 00:01:27,400
Should the hunter just watch them fight?

17
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:29,319
Or stir up conflict between them

18
00:01:29,519 --> 00:01:30,799
So they destroy each other?

19
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,959
But if the hunter does that

20
00:01:33,519 --> 00:01:34,120
The hunter

21
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:35,760
Might not escape unscathed

22
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,480
Madam

23
00:01:37,879 --> 00:01:38,920
who are

24
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,000
The tigers?

25
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,359
And who is the hunter?

26
00:01:41,599 --> 00:01:42,840
The things you say now...

27
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:44,239
I don't understand a word

28
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:47,719
Not understanding is a blessing

29
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,640
Dingding

30
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,319
Go back first

31
00:01:53,760 --> 00:01:55,280
Prepare my washing things for me

32
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:55,920
Yes

33
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,159
Brother, since you're here

34
00:02:01,519 --> 00:02:02,879
Won't you greet your sister-in-law?

35
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:11,840
What a pity

36
00:02:12,719 --> 00:02:13,719
Just missed it

37
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,000
Do you think the medicine that can cure all poisons

38
00:02:18,719 --> 00:02:19,719
is real or not?

39
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,800
It can't be fake

40
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,599
The envoy's life

41
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:25,000
Depends on it

42
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:28,919
I've done what you asked

43
00:02:28,919 --> 00:02:29,800
You wouldn't go back on your word

44
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,000
Would you?

45
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,639
What are you worried about?

46
00:02:36,199 --> 00:02:37,960
I'm a man of my word

47
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:40,520
Though the outcome wasn't what I wanted

48
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,400
Your courage and strategy

49
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,360
In the face of danger

50
00:02:45,159 --> 00:02:46,719
Truly impressed me

51
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,680
Such talent

52
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,240
Trapped in the small Weiyuan Marquisate...

53
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:52,120
Such a waste

54
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:54,400
You flatter me

55
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:56,000
I'm just an ordinary woman

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,879
Who wants a simple life

57
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,159
Your family

58
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,360
Is full of hidden talents

59
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,840
And intrigue

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,520
I'm not worthy of it

61
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:06,039
Now

62
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,639
Shall we discuss the details of the deal?

63
00:03:11,199 --> 00:03:12,759
Fan Xingxu has a seal

64
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,879
That he always carries with him

65
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,719
A personal seal?

66
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:19,639
So important?

67
00:03:19,639 --> 00:03:20,439
Once it's missing

68
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,039
He'll notice immediately

69
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:24,960
I won't let you steal it

70
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,800
You just need

71
00:03:27,039 --> 00:03:29,800
To stamp it on a blank document I prepare

72
00:03:30,759 --> 00:03:31,919
Once this is done

73
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:34,759
I guarantee Fan Xingxu will die without a whole body

74
00:03:34,919 --> 00:03:36,560
Then your relationship with him

75
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:38,120
Will cease to exist

76
00:03:40,719 --> 00:03:41,599
Don't forget

77
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,400
I'm his wife

78
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:44,919
If something happens to him

79
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:47,680
Can you guarantee I escape unscathed

80
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:48,759
Free from blame?

81
00:03:49,240 --> 00:03:50,520
Don't forget either

82
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:52,919
I'm his brother

83
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,639
Just do it

84
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,199
And

85
00:03:57,319 --> 00:03:58,479
You are smart

86
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:02,840
But I don't like others to question me

87
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:05,879
People say

88
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:07,280
I have no filter

89
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:09,560
You might need to get used to it

90
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:12,879
It's dark and windy

91
00:04:13,039 --> 00:04:14,039
Brother

92
00:04:14,199 --> 00:04:15,560
You should rest early

93
00:04:51,319 --> 00:04:53,000
Keeps it on his person

94
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:05,600
In the dead of night

95
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:07,560
Madam arrives uninvited

96
00:05:07,879 --> 00:05:08,959
What's your intention?

97
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,240
Today's events...

98
00:05:13,399 --> 00:05:14,879
I'm more and more afraid

99
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:17,079
I've thought it over

100
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,319
If it weren't for you

101
00:05:18,839 --> 00:05:20,160
I would have died many times over

102
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:22,360
Don't play tricks

103
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:23,360
Tell me

104
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:25,040
What do you want to do?

105
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,319
I just suddenly thought...

106
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,319
Instead of trying so hard to leave you

107
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:32,519
Why not just stay?

108
00:05:33,439 --> 00:05:34,480
Fan Xingxu

109
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:37,079
I once read a story

110
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,680
The woman in the story

111
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:40,160
Was imprisoned by a man

112
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:40,839
Tormented

113
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:42,600
But but with no one to rely on

114
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,720
After reaching the peak of fear and terror

115
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:47,240
She ended up falling in love with him

116
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,240
Tell me

117
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,839
Might I be like that woman?

118
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,720
Have I fallen for you?

119
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,000
Get out!

120
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:10,759
You...

121
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:12,399
Don't use your tricks for Fan Xingchen on me

122
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:13,639
And

123
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,120
Don't let me catch you at anything

124
00:06:16,439 --> 00:06:17,279
Get out!

125
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,360
Don't make me say it again

126
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:33,879
My Imperial Brother

127
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:35,720
Asked me to apologize to the envoy

128
00:06:36,279 --> 00:06:37,759
I'm so sorry

129
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:39,920
I trusted the wrong person

130
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,680
Almost ruining the peace talks

131
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,000
The success of this peace talks

132
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:45,000
Is a testament

133
00:06:45,079 --> 00:06:46,399
To our two nations' shared prosperity.

134
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:48,399
I

135
00:06:48,600 --> 00:06:50,000
Am willing to

136
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,040
Apologize

137
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:51,879
To the envoys

138
00:06:58,959 --> 00:07:00,240
You're too kind

139
00:07:06,279 --> 00:07:07,959
I have reflected seriously

140
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:09,319
Previously

141
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:10,560
I was too rash

142
00:07:10,839 --> 00:07:12,240
Failing to see the bigger picture

143
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:14,000
Fortunately

144
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,879
the envoy is blessed

145
00:07:16,079 --> 00:07:17,120
With good fortune

146
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:19,839
To express our apology

147
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:21,920
I wish

148
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:24,240
To find a unique gift

149
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:25,680
For the delegation

150
00:07:26,439 --> 00:07:27,279
In Yan

151
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,560
The purple sable is auspicious

152
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:29,839
I heard

153
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:32,519
One appeared in this hunting ground over a month ago

154
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,720
This creature

155
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,040
Is intelligent and agile

156
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,680
Which is a rare treasure

157
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:38,720
If we can hunt it

158
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,959
And present it to the delegation

159
00:07:39,959 --> 00:07:41,199
Cementing our friendship...

160
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:42,759
Wouldn't that

161
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,680
Be a splendid tale?

162
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,000
Marquis Wei Yuan

163
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,879
When it comes to archery

164
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:50,319
In all of our country

165
00:07:50,519 --> 00:07:51,920
No one surpasses you

166
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:54,040
May I ask, Marquis

167
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,199
If you would be willing

168
00:07:55,439 --> 00:07:56,680
To demonstrate your skill

169
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:57,680
And help me

170
00:07:57,879 --> 00:07:59,279
Search for this purple sable?

171
00:08:01,240 --> 00:08:02,120
Marquis Weiyuan!

172
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,120
Why don't we compete?

173
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,680
Since we're here

174
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:13,079
Let's hunt

175
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:18,319
Please

176
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:29,600
Wait for me here

177
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:30,959
Don't go anywhere

178
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:45,360
Hya!

179
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:45,679
Hya!

180
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:47,720
Hya!

181
00:08:49,919 --> 00:08:50,279
Hya!

182
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:04,399
You...

183
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,120
Are...

184
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,200
Dead...

185
00:09:07,399 --> 00:09:08,159
Meat...

186
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,360
I'll help her
