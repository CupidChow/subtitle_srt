1
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,399
Miss

2
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,960
Miss

3
00:00:58,200 --> 00:00:59,000
You all right？

4
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:00,119
I'm fine

5
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,079
I got really lucky today

6
00:01:03,159 --> 00:01:03,920
Miss

7
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:05,359
The way you looked earlier

8
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,959
It seemed you were deeply in love with the Marquis

9
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,040
But clearly

10
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:10,519
You're still young

11
00:01:10,519 --> 00:01:11,560
Too young to understand love

12
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,000
What couple

13
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
Doesn't make up before the day is done

14
00:01:16,079 --> 00:01:17,560
So

15
00:01:18,239 --> 00:01:19,480
You've fallen for the Marquis

16
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:21,400
That's absolutely impossible

17
00:01:29,359 --> 00:01:30,560
I love you beyond measure

18
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:32,599
In this life I'll marry only you

19
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,079
Never take a concubine

20
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:36,840
Even if my family disowns me leaving me alone and ruined

21
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:37,719
So...

22
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:40,159
Is using official duty for personal revenge funny?

23
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:43,799
You misunderstand

24
00:01:44,439 --> 00:01:45,319
What I did

25
00:01:45,599 --> 00:01:46,719
Was simply helping you

26
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:49,280
I told you to provoke her

27
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,560
Not make a fool of me

28
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:52,959
As a woman

29
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:54,760
I naturally understand women

30
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:57,760
Someone who once loved but couldn't have

31
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,400
Suddenly shifts affection elsewhere

32
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,159
Lifted to the clouds

33
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:02,280
Then cast aside like trash

34
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,400
That kind of fall

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,680
Ordinary people

36
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:05,840
Couldn't handle it

37
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:07,120
Is that so?

38
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:09,479
A woman

39
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:10,639
Clearly refused

40
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:11,520
Then changed her mind

41
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,560
What does her mean?

42
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,000
People are changeable by nature

43
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,879
Men can be fickle

44
00:02:17,199 --> 00:02:18,879
Women can naturally waver too

45
00:02:19,479 --> 00:02:21,319
But given the Marquis's status

46
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:22,840
You'd naturally prefer

47
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,919
To believe she's just

48
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:25,080
Playing hard to get

49
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:29,479
Since that's the case

50
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,759
Let's stoke the fire some more

51
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,400
My love

52
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:36,919
Rest assured

53
00:02:37,759 --> 00:02:39,080
Having sworn this vow to you

54
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,599
I will keep it faithfully

55
00:02:41,439 --> 00:02:42,439
Never abandon you

56
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:43,599
You and I

57
00:02:44,039 --> 00:02:45,120
Shall never part

58
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,560
The way she looks ready to kill me now

59
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,680
Seems she genuinely cares for you

60
00:03:02,039 --> 00:03:03,400
I'm almost feeling bad

61
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,280
If you find nothing amiss

62
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,680
Just go along with her

63
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,759
That way

64
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,960
I won't have to play this lovey-dovey act with you anymore

65
00:03:11,759 --> 00:03:12,960
How practical of you

66
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:16,080
Half the Marquis Weiyuan's estate

67
00:03:16,439 --> 00:03:17,520
Isn't so easily taken

68
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:20,960
Enough already

69
00:03:21,199 --> 00:03:22,159
Circumstances force me

70
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,080
Tell me

71
00:03:23,319 --> 00:03:24,120
What else can I do?

72
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,719
That day

73
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:29,080
I personally saw her buried

74
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,039
Now she's returned from death

75
00:03:31,639 --> 00:03:33,360
The body vanished from the coffin

76
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,840
And the two men who buried her

77
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,759
Quit and returned home separately

78
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,080
This is far too suspicious

79
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:41,560
I've already ordered men

80
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:42,719
To investigate thoroughly

81
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,520
If not ghosts or spirits

82
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,719
Then it's man-made

83
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,800
If it truly is man-made

84
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:54,000
He Weilan definitely has problems

85
00:03:57,919 --> 00:03:58,479
Marquis

86
00:03:58,680 --> 00:03:59,759
The matter is clarified

87
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,439
Those two grave-diggers

88
00:04:01,639 --> 00:04:02,479
Are dead

89
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,680
Dead

90
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:05,960
Cause of death

91
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:07,080
Both men

92
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,560
Died suddenly in succession

93
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,039
Autopsy performed

94
00:04:12,639 --> 00:04:13,400
Yes

95
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,879
No obvious wounds on the corpses

96
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,600
But chests appeared swollen

97
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,800
Likely struck with precise force

98
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,279
Causing organ rupture and death

99
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,360
All information about He Weilan

100
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:27,279
Especially her orphan background

101
00:04:27,519 --> 00:04:28,160
And

102
00:04:28,439 --> 00:04:29,800
How I came to know her

103
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,439
Everything related

104
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,120
Must be reinvestigated

105
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:33,560
Understood

106
00:04:41,639 --> 00:04:42,399
Sister He

107
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,240
Have you been comfortable

108
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,120
Staying at our estate

109
00:04:45,519 --> 00:04:46,439
Everything's fine

110
00:04:46,759 --> 00:04:48,079
Thank you

111
00:04:48,079 --> 00:04:49,480
And grandmother for protecting me

112
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:52,279
Honestly

113
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,879
I don't know what my brother was thinking

114
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,279
Rejecting a beauty as lovely as you

115
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:00,079
Guarding that sharp-tongued

116
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:01,680
Scheming woman every day

117
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,879
Who knows if she's bewitched him

118
00:05:05,279 --> 00:05:06,399
Sister Shen

119
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:07,959
Is after all Brother Xingxu's

120
00:05:07,959 --> 00:05:09,279
Properly wedded wife

121
00:05:10,399 --> 00:05:11,680
Her hostility toward me

122
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,480
Is understandable

123
00:05:14,279 --> 00:05:15,639
That you're willing to shelter me

124
00:05:15,839 --> 00:05:17,279
I'm already deeply grateful

125
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:18,839
Please don't let me

126
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,839
Damage family bonds

127
00:05:21,639 --> 00:05:22,600
What bonds?

128
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,759
Who has bonds with her?

129
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:25,360
When big brother wanted to marry her

130
00:05:25,439 --> 00:05:26,800
The whole family opposed it

131
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,040
But he insisted

132
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:30,560
I knew then

133
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:32,079
Once this person entered the estate

134
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:34,160
She'd surely stir up endless trouble

135
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,480
You have no idea

136
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:36,800
What's happened since

137
00:05:36,839 --> 00:05:38,160
She married in

138
00:05:39,879 --> 00:05:41,319
Even my second brother--

139
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,759
What happened after I married in

140
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:49,720
It seems you

141
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:51,240
Has many complaints about me

142
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,199
I've been neglectful as sister-in-law

143
00:05:54,839 --> 00:05:55,439
Well

144
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:57,000
Do enlighten me properly

145
00:05:57,079 --> 00:05:58,279
Let me reflect

146
00:05:58,560 --> 00:05:59,160
And see

147
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,040
How to improve

148
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:01,680
Sister you misunderstand

149
00:06:01,879 --> 00:06:02,839
Sister Xingtong

150
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:04,120
Meant nothing by it

151
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,160
Meant nothing

152
00:06:06,480 --> 00:06:07,600
Then what did she mean?

153
00:06:08,959 --> 00:06:09,439
Eldest sister-in-law

154
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,639
I'll be blunt then

155
00:06:11,519 --> 00:06:13,600
I heard you made my brother swear

156
00:06:13,959 --> 00:06:15,439
Never to take a concubine

157
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,519
Aren't you too domineering

158
00:06:17,959 --> 00:06:19,279
My brother is Marquis Weiyuan

159
00:06:19,439 --> 00:06:20,399
Taking concubines

160
00:06:20,839 --> 00:06:22,199
Or even multiple equal wives

161
00:06:22,279 --> 00:06:23,319
Is hardly unusual

162
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:24,959
If someday

163
00:06:24,959 --> 00:06:26,639
You fail to bear a son

164
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:29,360
Wouldn't you end our Marquis line

165
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,360
What are you doing?

166
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:33,959
Does it hurt?

167
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,720
Of course

168
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,439
Are you insane?

169
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:36,680
You feel pain when hit

170
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,759
So when you hit others

171
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:38,639
They'll feel pain too

172
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:40,120
Put yourself in her place

173
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,439
As fellow women

174
00:06:41,959 --> 00:06:44,079
I hope you marry someone devoted to loving

175
00:06:44,199 --> 00:06:44,680
Respecting

176
00:06:44,879 --> 00:06:46,600
Not a husband with multiple wives

177
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,199
Regardless if your future children are boys or girls

178
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:50,920
Or even if you bear none

179
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,240
You should hold your head high

180
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,160
Because first you are yourself

181
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:55,839
Then a husband's wife

182
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:56,959
And children's mother

183
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:01,800
What are you saying?

184
00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:02,959
Sister Xingtong

185
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,079
Could never fail to bear children

186
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,759
She's a noble lady

187
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,879
Her future husband

188
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,399
Will surely be wealthy and noble

189
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,160
She needn't worry about such things

190
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,319
Exactly

191
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:12,720
I have no need for such worries

192
00:07:13,399 --> 00:07:14,040
Sister He

193
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:14,480
Let's go

194
00:07:15,079 --> 00:07:17,079
Those interesting stories about Mobei you mentioned

195
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,160
You haven't finished telling me

196
00:07:18,279 --> 00:07:18,800
Hmm

197
00:07:22,279 --> 00:07:24,120
Back when I was in Mobei

198
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:25,720
I saw snow that deep for the first time

199
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,560
Icicles everywhere

200
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,560
Curious

201
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,759
I licked one

202
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:31,720
Then

203
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,040
My tongue stuck to it

204
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,639
Really

205
00:07:34,959 --> 00:07:35,879
How did you get free?

206
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,879
Well

207
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,399
Luckily there was hot water

208
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:39,680
Miss He

209
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,199
Your red bean soup is ready

210
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,000
The beans have been removed for you

211
00:07:43,920 --> 00:07:45,079
You don't eat red beans

212
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,720
I only drink the broth they're cooked in

213
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:50,879
Miss

214
00:07:51,079 --> 00:07:51,480
This

215
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,680
This Miss He

216
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,560
How does she?

217
00:07:54,519 --> 00:07:56,199
Choked on beans once as a child

218
00:07:56,399 --> 00:07:57,040
After that

219
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,480
Never dared eat red beans again

220
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,000
But craving the taste

221
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:02,040
Always wanted just the broth

222
00:08:03,079 --> 00:08:05,079
So I got to eat all miss's beans

223
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:06,800
Thought only you liked it this way

224
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:08,480
There's more

225
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,120
She's been to Mobei too

226
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,600
With similar experiences to mine

227
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,079
In this world

228
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,639
Can such coincidences really exist?

229
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,279
I find this rather eerie

230
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:22,000
Dingding

231
00:08:22,439 --> 00:08:24,279
Help me keep an eye on Miss He

232
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:26,120
Note all her preferences and habits

233
00:08:26,279 --> 00:08:27,240
Record them carefully

234
00:08:27,279 --> 00:08:27,879
And tell me

235
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:28,560
Alright

236
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:29,399
I understand

237
00:08:51,159 --> 00:08:51,600
Change into these

238
00:08:51,679 --> 00:08:52,039
Hurry go

239
00:09:05,879 --> 00:09:06,720
Fan Xingxu

240
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,759
Shen Yuanzhi

241
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,519
This time it's only just begun

242
00:09:12,080 --> 00:09:12,720
Go
