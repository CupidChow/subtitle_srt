1
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,719
Let me go!

2
00:01:15,120 --> 00:01:16,040
Let me go!

3
00:01:17,079 --> 00:01:19,400
What? For your lover?

4
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,920
You are just a lustful pervert!

5
00:01:22,359 --> 00:01:23,560
You're right.

6
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:25,760
I'm just in love with you.

7
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,359
I'm going to make you mine.

8
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:35,959
Miss, you're awake.

9
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:37,159
Are you okay?

10
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:43,799
Where is Fan Xingxu?

11
00:01:44,879 --> 00:01:45,599
Marquis?

12
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,400
He left early this morning.

13
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:54,680
My Lady,

14
00:01:55,159 --> 00:01:56,879
the Old Lady asked me to tell you

15
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,239
it's time to greet her.

16
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:13,479
Grandma, may you be in good health.

17
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,240
My Lady.

18
00:02:26,159 --> 00:02:26,639
My Lady.

19
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,199
What?

20
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,800
Just garbage thrown away by others

21
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:33,159
You're a disgrace,

22
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:35,680
yet you dare to enter our house?

23
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,319
How shameless!

24
00:02:44,919 --> 00:02:46,400
What do you mean?

25
00:02:46,719 --> 00:02:48,080
I've just married.

26
00:02:48,479 --> 00:02:49,560
Is this how

27
00:02:49,719 --> 00:02:51,280
you treat a new bride?

28
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,439
Nonsense!

29
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,439
Don't slander our family!

30
00:02:58,039 --> 00:03:00,439
You're the one who's unfaithful,

31
00:03:00,919 --> 00:03:02,680
yet you dare to accuse me!

32
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,680
On our wedding night,

33
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,000
but there's no blood.

34
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:11,800
You're not a virgin.

35
00:03:12,039 --> 00:03:12,800
How dare you

36
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,960
be the Marquise of Wei Yuan?

37
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,599
I'll go to your Shen family

38
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,360
and ask for an explanation.

39
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,360
Are you just being guilty

40
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,240
or are you crazy?

41
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:31,520
What should I be guilty about?

42
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,439
I'm laughing at your ignorance.

43
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:37,039
Whether there's a bloodstain on the wedding night

44
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:38,919
has nothing to do with whether she's a virgin.

45
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,080
Anyone who has read a few medical books

46
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:42,479
wouldn't be so ignorant.

47
00:03:43,479 --> 00:03:44,919
If I'm garbage,

48
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:47,319
then your noble Marquis of Wei Yuan

49
00:03:50,199 --> 00:03:51,759
is a rotten dustbin.

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:53,080
You...

51
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:55,039
What did you say?

52
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:57,960
I said garbage and dustbin make a perfect pair.

53
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:01,759
He found the guy himself,

54
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,360
and insisted on the marriage.

55
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,439
If you have the guts,

56
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,599
go find him yourselves!

57
00:04:06,039 --> 00:04:07,080
As women,

58
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:09,199
you resort to baseless rumors

59
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:10,520
to slander other women.

60
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:12,800
I'm ashamed

61
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:15,000
to be in the same category as you.

62
00:04:16,439 --> 00:04:19,079
You sharp-tongued b***h!

63
00:04:19,319 --> 00:04:21,079
You're so arrogant.

64
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:21,959
Guards!

65
00:04:22,399 --> 00:04:23,480
Hold her down!

66
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,240
Punish her!

67
00:04:26,839 --> 00:04:28,160
What are you doing?

68
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,079
What?

69
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,240
Let me go!

70
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,319
Be quiet.

71
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,600
Hold her down.

72
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,920
Let me go!

73
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Let go of me!

74
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:53,040
You need a lesson!

75
00:04:53,879 --> 00:04:54,560
My Lady,

76
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
I heard Minister Shen's wife died young,

77
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,240
so his daughter grew up without proper guidance.

78
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,079
It's no surprise.

79
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Like mother, like daughter.

80
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,800
Given her behavior,

81
00:05:06,319 --> 00:05:08,720
her mother wasn't much better.

82
00:05:23,439 --> 00:05:24,160
Grandma,

83
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,079
She's really crazy.

84
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:27,120
Someone's gonna die.

85
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,639
What do we do?

86
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,759
Let go.

87
00:05:30,879 --> 00:05:31,879
Let go.

88
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:49,519
I'll be visiting my parents in three days.

89
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,279
After that,

90
00:05:51,839 --> 00:05:54,040
I'll have to pay respects to the Queen.

91
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:58,319
I'll pretend nothing happened today.

92
00:05:59,879 --> 00:06:01,680
Grandma, you must protect me.

93
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,279
If I

94
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,279
feel unwell,

95
00:06:06,079 --> 00:06:07,639
I'll drag you

96
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:09,240
down with me

97
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:10,319
to the grave.

98
00:06:13,839 --> 00:06:14,319
You...

99
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:15,800
You...

100
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,920
Grandma, may you live long and prosper.

101
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:22,800
My days

102
00:06:23,279 --> 00:06:24,879
are numbered.

103
00:06:36,040 --> 00:06:37,120
Crazy.

104
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:40,160
She's crazy.

105
00:06:48,839 --> 00:06:49,839
Miss,

106
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,000
you must be in pain.

107
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,000
Why don't you explain?

108
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,720
You didn't consummate the marriage last night.

109
00:06:57,480 --> 00:06:58,560
False accusations

110
00:06:58,879 --> 00:07:00,480
are always wrong.

111
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:02,639
Someone wants to harm you.

112
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,079
You can't guard against it.

113
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:07,920
I thought you were going to be killed.

114
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:09,600
There were so many of them.

115
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,759
I couldn't beat them.

116
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,639
But I knew their selfishness and fear.

117
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:16,399
So I picked the biggest one

118
00:07:16,399 --> 00:07:18,160
and bit it hard.

119
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:20,360
I wanted to scare them.

120
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,959
I won the bet.

121
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:23,639
Ah.

122
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,319
I'm sorry, Miss.

123
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:28,399
How could he

124
00:07:28,839 --> 00:07:30,040
just leave you alone

125
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,120
after marrying you?

126
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,199
It's just what Fan Xingxu wants.

127
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
He wants me to suffer

128
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,319
and be in pain.

129
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,920
I'll show him.

130
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,240
I saw it.

131
00:07:57,439 --> 00:07:58,439
Not enough.

132
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,160
Get out.

133
00:08:02,439 --> 00:08:03,360
My dear,

134
00:08:04,279 --> 00:08:05,879
I heard you won the bet.

135
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:08,759
I didn't know

136
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:10,319
you were such a gambler.

137
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:14,560
Why don't you bet with me?

138
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:17,480
What are you up to?

139
00:08:21,519 --> 00:08:22,839
I'll give you a chance.

140
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:26,360
If you can make your beloved

141
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:28,040
give up all his fame and fortune

142
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,839
and run away with you,

143
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,480
I'll let go of all grudges

144
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:34,039
and grant you freedom.

145
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,240
In this mansion,

146
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:40,919
I'm the one with nothing.

147
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:42,039
I bet

148
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:44,679
you'll keep your word.

149
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,240
Deal.

150
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:24,919
My lord hasn't slept all night.

151
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:26,399
He's been waiting

152
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,200
for your return.

153
00:09:33,399 --> 00:09:34,320
Dad.

154
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:38,279
As long as you're safe.

155
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,480
Father-in-law.

156
00:09:40,879 --> 00:09:41,559
Hmph.

157
00:09:42,159 --> 00:09:43,080
My Lord.

158
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,080
Don't forget your promise to me.

159
00:09:49,879 --> 00:09:51,559
That depends on your lover

160
00:09:51,879 --> 00:09:53,279
whether he wants to or not.

161
00:10:00,879 --> 00:10:02,039
I've already bribed the carriage driver.

162
00:10:02,159 --> 00:10:03,039
He will help us.

163
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:03,879
We'll leave tonight.

164
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,279
Marquis Wei Yuan's Mansion.

165
00:10:06,159 --> 00:10:07,519
I can't stay here a moment longer.

166
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:10,120
The final exam is about to start.

167
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,279
I can't leave the capital.

168
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:16,000
Didn't you say

169
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,159
you were taking the exam

170
00:10:18,559 --> 00:10:19,960
to match my status

171
00:10:20,279 --> 00:10:21,480
and marry me?

172
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,600
Now I'm forced to marry

173
00:10:23,639 --> 00:10:24,799
and endure humiliation.

174
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,440
What's more important than

175
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,399
saving me from this?

176
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:28,240
Yuan Zhi,

177
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,919
stop dreaming.

178
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:33,519
Even if we run away,

179
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,679
we can't escape the capital.

180
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:39,679
Marquis Weyuan won't let us go.

181
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,279
Gu Hengyuan, look clearly.

182
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:48,519
These injuries were all for you.

183
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:50,759
Shen Yuanzhi,

184
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:52,840
all the suffering I've endured in my life

185
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,399
is nothing compared to what you've put me through.

186
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:56,919
Are you going to break my heart?

187
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:58,120
Yuan Zhi, calm down.

188
00:10:58,679 --> 00:10:59,799
What if someone finds out?

189
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:01,279
How about this?

190
00:11:03,039 --> 00:11:05,120
We can discuss this matter further.

191
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,639
When things take a turn...

192
00:11:08,879 --> 00:11:09,559
No.

193
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,639
After my imperial examination,

194
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,480
wait for my message.

195
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,919
Take care of yourself.

196
00:11:52,799 --> 00:11:53,759
Are you done?

197
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,559
As you wish.

198
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:58,639
Aren't you curious

199
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:00,960
why your beloved

200
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:02,919
is so ruthless?

201
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,039
What do you mean?

202
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:15,360
Shen Yuanzhi wants to run away with you?

203
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,000
Keep your voice down.

204
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,120
How dare she?

205
00:12:19,720 --> 00:12:21,879
Marquis Wei Yuan is so powerful.

206
00:12:22,799 --> 00:12:24,120
She won't be afraid of being caught

207
00:12:24,159 --> 00:12:25,480
and punished.

208
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,240
She must have had a tough time

209
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:28,399
in the Wei Yuan Marquis's residence.

210
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,320
I'm just worried

211
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:31,480
she might spill the beans

212
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:32,440
about us.

213
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:33,399
Then we're done for.

214
00:12:33,759 --> 00:12:35,000
What's there to fear?

215
00:12:35,799 --> 00:12:37,039
By then,

216
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,360
we can say that she couldn't stand loneliness

217
00:12:39,759 --> 00:12:41,360
and seduced you.

218
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:45,039
A married daughter is like water that's been spilled.

219
00:12:45,679 --> 00:12:47,039
Even the Lord

220
00:12:47,759 --> 00:12:49,399
couldn't protect her.

221
00:12:51,559 --> 00:12:54,240
You're the most scheming.

222
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,399
Even if I'm scheming,

223
00:12:56,519 --> 00:12:58,320
I'm still yours.

224
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:23,080
Right?

225
00:13:27,759 --> 00:13:28,519
Yuan Zhi.

226
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,120
Let me explain.

227
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:32,320
Yuan Zhi.

228
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:35,919
I thought I was smart,

229
00:13:36,759 --> 00:13:38,360
but I'm just a joke.

230
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:39,639
No.

231
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,000
Good.

232
00:13:43,039 --> 00:13:43,919
Great.

233
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:44,879
Shen Yuanzhi.

234
00:13:45,639 --> 00:13:47,919
If you dare to spread this,

235
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:50,840
I'll have Hengyuan tell Marquis Wei Yuan

236
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,000
Tell him you're not a good wife

237
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,360
and seduce...

238
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:54,480
You let him go!

239
00:13:55,879 --> 00:13:57,080
I want to see

240
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,480
what he'll say about me.

241
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:03,600
Yuan Zhi.

242
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,840
My dear.

243
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:19,639
What happened?

244
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,159
Who hurt you?

245
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,559
You already knew.

246
00:14:43,919 --> 00:14:45,200
You did it on purpose, right?

247
00:14:48,159 --> 00:14:48,879
Does it matter?

248
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,159
You said

249
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,360
you'd make me feel all the pain,

250
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:54,840
heartbroken,

251
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:56,440
and worse than death.

252
00:14:58,279 --> 00:14:59,279
You've done it.

253
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:00,840
I feel

254
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,000
so much pain,

255
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:03,440
so much pain.

256
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:06,080
But how can I

257
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,360
bear this pain alone?

258
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,320
Aren't you curious

259
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,360
about how your beloved

260
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,399
died?
