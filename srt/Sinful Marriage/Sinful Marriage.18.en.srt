1
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,679
How did you get so badly injured？

2
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,159
I'm fine

3
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,799
She's actually alive

4
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,560
Find Hawkeye

5
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,640
Bring the golden wound ointment

6
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,400
Yes

7
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:23,239
I'll go right away

8
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:30,879
It hurts

9
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,439
If you knew it would hurt

10
00:01:32,959 --> 00:01:34,120
Why did you act on your own？

11
00:01:34,719 --> 00:01:35,560
If I'd arrived any later

12
00:01:35,560 --> 00:01:36,000
You would've—

13
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:39,560
I acted rashly today

14
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:41,239
I saw He Weilan

15
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,439
Dressed differently

16
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,760
Sneaking out of the marquis's manor

17
00:01:44,239 --> 00:01:46,000
I followed without thinking

18
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:47,560
But I did leave a backup plan

19
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,840
I had Dingding send word

20
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:49,640
Still making excuses

21
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,120
If I hadn't returned in time

22
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,719
By the time your maid found me

23
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,280
You'd have been a wandering spirit already

24
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,359
I promised to help

25
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,280
So I must see it through

26
00:01:58,879 --> 00:02:00,400
I just wanted to handle things properly

27
00:02:00,959 --> 00:02:02,319
Once everything's settled

28
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:04,000
We can annul our marriage sooner

29
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:05,840
And I can leave the marquis's manor early

30
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:06,879
Start anew

31
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,800
Do you hate me that much？

32
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,560
To leave me

33
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:14,280
You'd even risk your life

34
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:15,879
It hurts

35
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,159
My hand hurts

36
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:21,280
Sorry

37
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:24,319
Marquis

38
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:25,919
Why does that sound so strange？

39
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:29,520
What do you mean "do I hate you that much"？

40
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,840
How did I marry into this house？

41
00:02:32,439 --> 00:02:33,000
After marriage

42
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:34,319
What kind of life have I had？

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:36,039
In just a few months

44
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:37,800
You've forgotten everything

45
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,960
Any normal woman

46
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:41,840
Facing a man who constantly threatens

47
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,080
And hurts her

48
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:45,000
Would want to stay far away

49
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:47,599
I haven't forgotten

50
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:49,360
I owe you

51
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:51,479
I'll find a way to make it right

52
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,800
I'm not a masochist

53
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:56,680
But I'll accept your compensation

54
00:02:57,639 --> 00:02:58,879
Just keep your promise

55
00:02:59,199 --> 00:03:00,520
Let me go when it's done

56
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,840
Then everyone's happy

57
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:07,680
Fine

58
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,120
Someone unbound by emotions

59
00:03:10,919 --> 00:03:12,520
Can act as they please

60
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,960
No grievances

61
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,280
No compromises

62
00:03:15,759 --> 00:03:16,639
No sacrifices

63
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:20,280
You should always be like this

64
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:21,800
Every step ahead

65
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,159
Plan well for yourself

66
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:24,919
Naturally

67
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:26,319
After all in this world

68
00:03:26,759 --> 00:03:27,680
Only yourself

69
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,120
Is truly reliable

70
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,400
Put it down

71
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:37,960
I'll apply the medicine

72
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:38,719
But—

73
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:40,719
With the marquis here

74
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:41,919
You may leave

75
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:43,280
Yes

76
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:05,599
Rest well

77
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,000
These coming days

78
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,400
Don't do anything

79
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,159
Fan Xingchen escaped prison

80
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:12,400
Since this matter

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,840
Involves him

82
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:15,520
There will be conflict

83
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,519
He's narrow-minded

84
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,639
And vengeful

85
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:20,319
Better be cautious

86
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,639
You can guard against thieves for a thousand days

87
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,439
But not forever

88
00:04:26,279 --> 00:04:27,600
He must have ties

89
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,519
To He Weilan

90
00:04:29,319 --> 00:04:30,800
Let's add fuel to the fire

91
00:04:31,079 --> 00:04:32,199
Force them out

92
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:35,199
Never learn your lesson

93
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:37,560
This matter

94
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:38,959
Follow my orders

95
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,399
Don't act on your own

96
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:42,560
I'll find another way

97
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:45,600
Understand？

98
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,680
Just talk

99
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:51,920
Why so close?

100
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:00,079
Tonight

101
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:01,480
I'll stay with you

102
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,040
Rest well

103
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:18,680
He

104
00:05:19,519 --> 00:05:21,399
Seems different now

105
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:24,079
Is he worried about me

106
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,639
Or worried I'll ruin his plans

107
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:37,800
Be careful, miss

108
00:05:43,480 --> 00:05:44,439
Sister-in-law

109
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,319
I heard you're injured again

110
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:49,759
What cursed fate do you have?

111
00:05:50,079 --> 00:05:51,360
Since marrying into the marquis's house

112
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,199
Every few days it's a broken hand

113
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:54,360
Or some injury

114
00:05:54,360 --> 00:05:55,160
Honestly

115
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:57,360
You should visit Yanjing Temple

116
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,879
Ask a master

117
00:05:58,879 --> 00:05:59,800
To change your fate

118
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,600
Don't curse us all

119
00:06:03,439 --> 00:06:05,079
Thanks for your concern

120
00:06:05,959 --> 00:06:07,560
How strange though

121
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:09,759
Before marrying in

122
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,360
I was strong and healthy

123
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,240
Never even caught a cold

124
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:15,759
But since joining your family

125
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,199
I've never been unharmed

126
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:18,920
Not to mention

127
00:06:19,519 --> 00:06:21,000
That incident with your second brother

128
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:22,600
Nearly doomed the whole clan

129
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,680
Head and body separated

130
00:06:24,399 --> 00:06:25,560
You're right

131
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,600
This Weiyuan Marquisate

132
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,319
Must have some fatal curse

133
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:30,920
Should really find a master

134
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:31,639
To examine it

135
00:06:32,079 --> 00:06:32,920
What did you say?

136
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:33,759
Ugh

137
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,360
I'm unlucky

138
00:06:35,839 --> 00:06:37,040
Being cursed first

139
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:39,319
With so many days ahead

140
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:40,480
Sister-in-law

141
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,759
You should tell grandmother

142
00:06:42,759 --> 00:06:44,040
To fix this problem

143
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,480
Don't shift blame

144
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,920
Our marquisate is centuries-old nobility

145
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:48,959
How could it curse you?

146
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,079
It's all you—

147
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,560
Sister Shen is injured

148
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,800
We're here to see her

149
00:06:55,279 --> 00:06:56,079
Not to argue

150
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,560
I made this tonic myself

151
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:10,720
Promotes circulation

152
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,480
Good for your injury

153
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:13,879
You

154
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:15,720
Must try it

155
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,480
No

156
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,560
Our madam

157
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:22,720
Won't drink suspicious things

158
00:07:22,959 --> 00:07:23,399
Hmph

159
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:25,160
A weasel paying respects to a chicken

160
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Can't recognize kindness

161
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,160
Sister Weilan

162
00:07:27,399 --> 00:07:27,959
Let's go

163
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:29,399
She doesn't appreciate it

164
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,360
A weasel giving New Year's greetings to a chicken

165
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:32,519
Playing the saint

166
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:34,279
Sister-in-law

167
00:07:35,279 --> 00:07:37,000
Is this how you discipline your servant?

168
00:07:37,439 --> 00:07:38,079
Dingding

169
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,399
How can you say "weasel to a chicken"

170
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:43,240
Even if Miss He is the weasel

171
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm not a chicken

172
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:47,720
Doesn't sound nice, does it?

173
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:55,759
Madam

174
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:01,600
Aren't you afraid

175
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:03,040
The tonic was poisoned

176
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:06,079
Miss He is clever

177
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:08,000
Clever people doing bad things

178
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:09,800
Won't leave obvious traces

179
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,079
If the tonic were really poisoned

180
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,360
Wouldn't that just

181
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,000
Hand us evidence

182
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,160
Sister Shen

183
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:19,680
Truly wise

184
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:21,399
And sharp-minded

185
00:08:26,439 --> 00:08:27,279
Pity

186
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,079
Just a bit short

187
00:08:29,959 --> 00:08:31,959
Of sending you to meet Yama

188
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,240
Next time

189
00:08:35,320 --> 00:08:36,960
Won't be so easy

190
00:08:37,759 --> 00:08:39,120
To escape

191
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:47,200
If sister Shen likes it

192
00:08:47,759 --> 00:08:48,519
Every day

193
00:08:48,639 --> 00:08:50,080
I'll bring the tonic

194
00:08:54,519 --> 00:08:55,120
Madam

195
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:56,320
Madam

196
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:57,240
Madam

197
00:09:05,039 --> 00:09:05,879
What happened?

198
00:09:07,039 --> 00:09:08,559
We came to see sister-in-law

199
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,360
Just now

200
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:12,240
She drank Weilan's tonic

201
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:13,639
And vomited blood

202
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:15,279
I know nothing

203
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:16,159
What tonic?

204
00:09:16,799 --> 00:09:17,559
It was just

205
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:17,960
Angelica

206
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,759
Astragalus and other tonics

207
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:19,960
I

208
00:09:20,919 --> 00:09:21,799
Don't know

209
00:09:21,799 --> 00:09:22,720
Why she—

210
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:26,720
I swear

211
00:09:27,080 --> 00:09:27,919
In this tonic

212
00:09:28,039 --> 00:09:29,679
I added nothing else

213
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:31,320
Get out

214
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,519
From now on

215
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:35,080
No one approaches her

216
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,759
Fine

217
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,080
We won't come again

218
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:38,799
Never again

219
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:39,879
Let's go

220
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,360
I can't control him when he's mad

221
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:49,519
Are you alright?

222
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:51,360
Where does it hurt?

223
00:09:52,879 --> 00:09:53,639
I'll get the physician

224
00:09:58,360 --> 00:09:59,679
The blood pack I made

225
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:01,080
Looks real

226
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:02,200
Doesn't it?

227
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:13,879
You

228
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,279
It's sweet

229
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,279
What are you playing at?

230
00:10:18,159 --> 00:10:18,879
I said

231
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:20,159
We needed more fuel

232
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,399
I don't want theories

233
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,320
I only know

234
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:24,480
What I promise

235
00:10:24,679 --> 00:10:25,559
I deliver

236
00:10:26,039 --> 00:10:27,360
Can't argue with you

237
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:29,559
Since you started the fire

238
00:10:30,159 --> 00:10:31,320
I'll take this favor

239
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:33,879
Now

240
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:35,399
I'll add more oil

241
00:10:36,159 --> 00:10:37,679
Make it blaze higher

242
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,360
Do you care for her that much?

243
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:50,919
Brother Xingxu

244
00:10:51,840 --> 00:10:52,559
About today

245
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,679
I believe

246
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:55,120
It wasn't your doing

247
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,399
I knew it

248
00:10:57,879 --> 00:10:59,320
You wouldn't blame me unfairly

249
00:10:59,879 --> 00:11:01,320
You still care for me

250
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:02,960
I've said

251
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:04,559
All I need to say

252
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,879
I came

253
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,279
For another matter

254
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:11,120
What is it?

255
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,120
I bought

256
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,720
A house in the suburbs

257
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:16,720
Move there when ready

258
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,320
What do you mean?

259
00:11:20,759 --> 00:11:22,320
You're kicking me out

260
00:11:22,919 --> 00:11:23,720
You and I

261
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,519
Shouldn't live together

262
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,879
What's inappropriate?

263
00:11:30,679 --> 00:11:32,360
Did Shen Yuanzhi say something?

264
00:11:32,759 --> 00:11:34,080
Did she force you?

265
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:35,039
In this world

266
00:11:35,679 --> 00:11:36,919
If I don't want to do something

267
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:38,519
No one can force me

268
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:41,080
She needs rest to heal

269
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:42,519
I don't want you disturbing her

270
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:54,320
I'll avoid her then

271
00:11:57,039 --> 00:11:58,039
With you here

272
00:11:58,279 --> 00:11:59,600
She's troubled daily

273
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,480
When she's unsettled

274
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:04,519
I'm disturbed too

275
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,080
So you can't stay

276
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:16,000
Fan Xingxu

277
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:19,200
Look at yourself now

278
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,200
She smiles, you smile

279
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,919
She cries, you cry too

280
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:27,559
Shen Yuanzhi's slightest move

281
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:29,279
Leaves you distracted

282
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:30,440
And confused

283
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:35,200
Even when you claimed to love me

284
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,759
You never acted like this

285
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,399
I never realized

286
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,600
You're such a hopeless romantic

287
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:51,399
Think what you want

288
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:53,639
Pack properly

289
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:54,879
In three days

290
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:56,279
I'll send you away

291
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,559
Fan Xingxu

292
00:13:21,960 --> 00:13:23,559
Shen Yuanzhi

293
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,360
You forced me into this
