1
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:59,359
How dare you frame me!

2
00:01:00,439 --> 00:01:01,600
What evidence do you have?

3
00:01:20,599 --> 00:01:21,879
Please compare this wine

4
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,680
With the wine of the envoy

5
00:01:24,239 --> 00:01:25,760
I believe the truth will come out soon

6
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,920
Are you insane?

7
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,400
How dare you accuse the princess!

8
00:01:31,760 --> 00:01:32,799
Xu!

9
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,000
Arrest her!

10
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:47,439
Conspiring against the envoy

11
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:49,280
And slandering the royal lineage

12
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:50,359
The crime is

13
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:51,400
She deserves death!

14
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:52,560
Shen Yuanzhi

15
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:53,439
Today

16
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:54,519
Is your day of reckoning!

17
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:55,719
Guards!

18
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,760
Arrest her!

19
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,760
Execute her on the spot!

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,120
Who dares to arrest me?

21
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,120
Though I am a mere woman

22
00:02:02,439 --> 00:02:03,280
I am still a citizen of Yan!

23
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,560
If the Princess

24
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:06,799
Refuses to admit her guilt

25
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:08,120
It's not a personal grudge

26
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,240
But a national hatred

27
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,400
Conspiring with foreign enemies

28
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,280
And plotting against the envoy

29
00:02:11,639 --> 00:02:12,840
My death is not a big deal

30
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,479
But if this matter

31
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,120
Leads to the breakdown of talks

32
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:17,560
And even leads to war

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:18,960
As the daughter of the royal family

34
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,840
You have enjoyed the benefits of the common people

35
00:02:20,919 --> 00:02:22,319
So you must bear the responsibility of the country

36
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:23,360
Princess Nine

37
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:25,560
You'd rather sacrifice the people of Yan

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:27,080
Than admit your mistakes?

39
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:28,759
How dare you!

40
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:37,840
Grandma

41
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:01,000
My Lord

42
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:01,680
It's a poison

43
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:11,520
I once met a great physician at the border

44
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,159
He gave me a pill

45
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,400
That can antidote all poisons

46
00:03:14,599 --> 00:03:15,560
Today, I encountered this situation

47
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,240
In desperation

48
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,240
I thought of this medicine

49
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,599
I didn't expect

50
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:19,840
it to work so well

51
00:03:20,919 --> 00:03:22,400
I will never forget

52
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,159
your kindness today

53
00:03:24,479 --> 00:03:26,520
The reception banquet was held at my residence

54
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,479
If something happened there

55
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:30,000
I bear an inescapable responsibility

56
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,759
I've had it checked

57
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:33,759
There was indeed poison

58
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,280
In my wife's wine

59
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,319
It was the poison of the fugu

60
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:37,879
No way

61
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,800
How could it be?

62
00:03:41,439 --> 00:03:42,000
Your Highness

63
00:03:42,759 --> 00:03:43,400
How did the poison

64
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,360
Get into my wife's wine?

65
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:47,159
Does Qin

66
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:49,120
Have any solid evidence

67
00:03:49,759 --> 00:03:51,240
Or being manipulated

68
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,080
False accusations?

69
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,280
I will thoroughly investigate

70
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:55,800
If, as my wife says

71
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:57,360
It's related to the princess

72
00:03:57,960 --> 00:03:59,960
I believe Your Majesty will act impartially

73
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,599
For the peace of both nations

74
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,360
It's not me

75
00:04:03,719 --> 00:04:05,000
It has nothing to do with me

76
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:12,360
It's you!

77
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,360
It's all your fault!

78
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:16,079
You lied Shen Yuanzhi conspired

79
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:17,920
You've been using me all along

80
00:04:18,399 --> 00:04:19,040
No

81
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:19,839
Princess Nine

82
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:20,319
Yes

83
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,759
Did you cover my eyes

84
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,560
Because you were afraid I'd be

85
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,079
Scared by my stepmother's death?

86
00:04:35,439 --> 00:04:36,839
I was afraid you'd be too happy

87
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,160
To control yourself

88
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,480
And laugh out loud

89
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:41,439
That's improper

90
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,000
You know me well

91
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:00,160
Fan Xingxu

92
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,160
What are you doing?

93
00:05:07,439 --> 00:05:08,920
You carry the poison with you?

94
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:12,360
You don't trust me?

95
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:17,439
My Lord

96
00:05:17,959 --> 00:05:20,279
The man who poisoned has been tortured

97
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:22,000
He said he was just paid to do it

98
00:05:22,279 --> 00:05:24,160
And didn't know who was behind it

99
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:26,079
If they can reach

100
00:05:26,480 --> 00:05:28,240
My residence

101
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:29,839
They must be someone important

102
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:32,360
Don't alert them

103
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:33,759
Keep investigating

104
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:35,000
Yes

105
00:05:42,879 --> 00:05:44,040
Haven't you tired of

106
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:45,480
Listening secretly for so long?

107
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:49,079
I've made some progress

108
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,519
On the task you gave me

109
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,519
Fan Xingchen is indeed suspicious

110
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,639
But he doesn't fully trust me

111
00:05:58,519 --> 00:05:59,439
He wants to test me

112
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:01,639
He asked me to poison the mission

113
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,279
At the reception banquet

114
00:06:06,879 --> 00:06:08,399
It seems he has made two preparations

115
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:09,439
On the one hand, he asked me to do it

116
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:11,040
On the other hand, he arranged his own people

117
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,439
Not necessarily

118
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:15,560
What do you mean?

119
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:17,639
There may be more than one person

120
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,079
Who wants to poison someone

121
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,199
You can't do this

122
00:06:24,199 --> 00:06:24,560
No

123
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,160
The poison must be administered

124
00:06:28,519 --> 00:06:29,199
Only in this way

125
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:30,720
Can you fully gain his trust

126
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,040
But...

127
00:06:32,399 --> 00:06:33,560
I have my own plan

128
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:39,680
So your plan

129
00:06:39,839 --> 00:06:41,560
Is to ask the ambassador to act with you

130
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,959
Pretending to be poisoned

131
00:06:43,399 --> 00:06:44,600
To lead to the person behind the scene

132
00:06:44,920 --> 00:06:46,600
The medicine that can cure all poisons

133
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,240
is all a bluff

134
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,040
Are you sure

135
00:06:50,199 --> 00:06:51,519
Fan Xingchen will believe you?

136
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,279
Whether he believes or not

137
00:06:54,879 --> 00:06:55,800
He has to believe

138
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,639
What's more, the Princess Nine was exposed

139
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:00,120
What a good

140
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:01,120
act!

141
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:02,560
And you

142
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,360
Acting on your own

143
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,839
And poisoning yourself

144
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,959
Trying to humiliate Princess Nine in public

145
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,360
Don't you fear I won't protect you?

146
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:17,560
When she mentioned Qin

147
00:07:18,439 --> 00:07:20,600
I knew she was the one who poisoned me

148
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:21,759
She was after me

149
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,160
Not an envoy

150
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,160
I did this

151
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,839
Just to protect myself

152
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,720
Besides

153
00:07:29,319 --> 00:07:30,199
This whole mess

154
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:31,600
Started because of you.

155
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:34,040
Because of me?

156
00:07:34,839 --> 00:07:36,079
You're the one

157
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:38,480
Who's causing trouble

158
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,199
You're the root of all this chaos

159
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:43,720
His Majesty's decree

160
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:45,519
Speaking without thinking

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,639
Prince Nine

162
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,680
Though a royal princess, you lacks a statesman's vision

163
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:55,360
Caused trouble repeatedly

164
00:07:55,519 --> 00:07:56,600
From now on

165
00:07:56,759 --> 00:07:58,360
Confined to the palace

166
00:07:58,560 --> 00:07:59,839
Shen Yuanzhi
Reflect on your mistakes

167
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:01,560
Fan Xingxu
Reflect on your mistakes

168
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,680
I won't let you off the hook
