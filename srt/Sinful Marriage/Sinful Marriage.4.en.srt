1
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:53,560
Shush.

2
00:00:53,759 --> 00:00:54,320
What?

3
00:00:55,119 --> 00:00:56,520
You want me to spread false information

4
00:00:57,159 --> 00:00:59,359
that the envoys of peace talks

5
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:01,640
are hiding assassins?

6
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:02,799
What are you afraid of?

7
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,719
Since the ambush failed,

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,959
we can use this to our advantage.

9
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,480
Let the court officials take advantage

10
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:13,959
to stop the envoys from entering the capital.

11
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,040
It's not impossible.

12
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:17,400
But

13
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:20,599
I want to see your master.

14
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:27,959
Fan Xingxu sent you here?

15
00:01:39,959 --> 00:01:40,680
Follow me.

16
00:01:49,879 --> 00:01:50,439
Uncomfortable?

17
00:01:51,319 --> 00:01:52,959
I thought you were used to corpses.

18
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:55,959
You let that guy

19
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,239
go on purpose, right?

20
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,560
He could have been saved,

21
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,359
but you let him die.

22
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,640
Why did you do that?

23
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:04,719
Just want to make him lose his judgment,

24
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:06,760
and make him think you want to catch him.

25
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:08,560
But what you really want

26
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,039
is to use him

27
00:02:10,159 --> 00:02:11,479
to find the person you want.

28
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,000
Showing off isn't smart

29
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:16,919
in front of others.

30
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,960
But from another angle,

31
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,400
it's easier to make a deal

32
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,719
if you show your cards appropriately before negotiation.

33
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,599
You've succeeded.

34
00:02:31,639 --> 00:02:32,879
I can help you avenge.

35
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:33,840
But you

36
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,120
need to do something for me.

37
00:02:37,199 --> 00:02:37,960
What?

38
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,479
Get your father,

39
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,319
Minister of Revenue, Shen Xiao,

40
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,560
to advocate for peace in the reconquest.

41
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,400
If you can do it,

42
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:49,240
I can ruin your ex-lover, Gu Hengyuan's

43
00:02:49,439 --> 00:02:50,759
career.

44
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:04,840
Come on, my dear.

45
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:05,800
Have some soup.

46
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:09,360
My dear.

47
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:10,199
What's wrong?

48
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,439
Did you eat something bad?

49
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:13,919
Someone!

50
00:03:14,479 --> 00:03:15,840
Go get the doctor.

51
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,280
Dad.

52
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,639
Why are you here?

53
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:22,319
Father,

54
00:03:22,759 --> 00:03:24,280
my husband has specially invited the imperial physician

55
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,319
to check your pulse.

56
00:03:28,479 --> 00:03:29,639
What's the matter?

57
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:30,439
Oh,

58
00:03:30,639 --> 00:03:31,319
physician,

59
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:32,719
you're just in time.

60
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,919
Your mother is unwell.

61
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,680
Please help her.

62
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,159
Congratulations, Lord.

63
00:03:51,759 --> 00:03:53,000
Your wife is fine.

64
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,120
She just has morning sickness.

65
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:57,360
Some tonics will do.

66
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:58,319
What?

67
00:04:00,039 --> 00:04:00,840
My Lord,

68
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:02,439
did you hear that?

69
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,879
All my prayers have paid off.

70
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:08,120
The gods have blessed us

71
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,560
with a child.

72
00:04:11,639 --> 00:04:12,520
My Lord,

73
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:14,759
our Shen family

74
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,879
finally has an heir.

75
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,360
Tell me,

76
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,959
whose bastard is in your belly?

77
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,720
Bastard?

78
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,959
What bastard?

79
00:04:30,279 --> 00:04:31,120
My Lord,

80
00:04:31,519 --> 00:04:33,120
this is our child!

81
00:04:33,879 --> 00:04:34,519
My Lord,

82
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,519
I've never done anything wrong

83
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,480
to you or the Shen family.

84
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:40,639
How could you accuse me like this?

85
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,000
Did she tell you something?

86
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:44,959
She's your daughter,

87
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:48,360
but I'm the one by your side every night.

88
00:04:48,959 --> 00:04:50,759
You trust her over me?

89
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,319
You little bitch!

90
00:04:55,519 --> 00:04:56,680
You want to kill me?

91
00:05:03,879 --> 00:05:05,639
If you hurt her,

92
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,720
you'll be killing yourself.

93
00:05:11,399 --> 00:05:11,879
Dad,

94
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,639
Just let her die with clarity.

95
00:05:17,399 --> 00:05:18,399
[Ten years ago,]

96
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:19,680
[I was eight years old.]

97
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:22,240
[After my mother passed away,]

98
00:05:22,439 --> 00:05:23,759
[my father married Aunt Qin.]

99
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,079
Are you Shen Yuanzhi?

100
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:28,839
So cute.

101
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,560
Hahaha.

102
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:37,519
Let me show you what I can do.

103
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:38,680
Not a drop left.

104
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:39,240
Force them to drink it!

105
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:43,120
Hahaha!

106
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:45,879
To prevent other concubines from getting pregnant,

107
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,519
you force them to drink the potion,

108
00:05:48,959 --> 00:05:50,439
even if it kills them?

109
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,439
Nonsense!

110
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,199
Don't believe her, My Lord!

111
00:05:58,079 --> 00:05:59,839
I discovered this by accident

112
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:01,720
and planned to tell my father.

113
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:03,120
I thought

114
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,560
he'll punish you with family rules.

115
00:06:05,439 --> 00:06:06,399
I didn't expect...

116
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:08,040
What?

117
00:06:09,079 --> 00:06:10,360
I didn't expect...

118
00:06:13,720 --> 00:06:16,399
I didn't expect that after I married you,

119
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,920
I found that I had a hidden disease

120
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,839
and couldn't have children.

121
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:26,519
I feel sorry for you.

122
00:06:26,839 --> 00:06:28,639
I've always been

123
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:30,560
turning a blind eye to your behavior.

124
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:32,439
and pretend to know nothing.

125
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:34,399
I love you so much

126
00:06:34,439 --> 00:06:35,399
and am so tolerant to you.

127
00:06:35,439 --> 00:06:36,839
But you treat me like this?

128
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,879
No way.

129
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,279
No way.

130
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,639
How could this happen?

131
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,279
No way.

132
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:49,879
My Lord,

133
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:51,680
this person was eavesdropping outside the door.

134
00:06:51,959 --> 00:06:53,120
Later, I saw him sneaking around

135
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,360
with a bag and trying to leave.

136
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,120
I found him suspicious

137
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,120
and arrested him.

138
00:06:57,519 --> 00:06:59,759
You heartless bastard!

139
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,920
You sweet-talked me in bed,

140
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,279
and now that I'm carrying your child,

141
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:08,199
you want to run away?

142
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Are you even a man?

143
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,879
Enough!

144
00:07:13,519 --> 00:07:15,040
From now on,

145
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,040
you're no longer part of the Shen family.

146
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:21,199
As for you...

147
00:07:21,839 --> 00:07:22,759
I've heard

148
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,000
you're a candidate for the imperial examination.

149
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:27,240
How can such a filthy person

150
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,319
taint the eyes of His Majesty?

151
00:07:29,959 --> 00:07:31,519
I'll inform the Ministry of Rites

152
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,920
to revoke his exam eligibility.

153
00:07:34,519 --> 00:07:35,240
My Lord.

154
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:36,879
I'm sorry, my lord.

155
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:37,879
My lord,

156
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:40,079
please give me another chance.

157
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,199
It's him.

158
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,560
He tricked me.

159
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:44,439
I'm innocent, sir.

160
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:45,240
Yuan Zhi.

161
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:46,720
Yuan Zhi.

162
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:49,120
Speak for me.

163
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,160
For the sake of our old friendship,

164
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:51,560
You can

165
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,240
plead for them.

166
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,399
Plead for them, Yuan Zhi.

167
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:57,879
Guards!

168
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:00,399
Throw these two

169
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,160
out of the Shen residence.

170
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:03,480
Now!

171
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,120
Immediately!

172
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,160
Right away!

173
00:08:40,879 --> 00:08:42,559
My husband is indeed decisive.

174
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,759
Same to you.

175
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,759
I believe you are a man of your word.

176
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,960
The stage has been set up for you.

177
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,120
Please start your performance.

178
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:02,600
When they find out

179
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:04,679
the child is just a figment of imagination,

180
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:06,039
it will be more interesting.

181
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,360
Without me,

182
00:09:07,799 --> 00:09:09,279
you will also succeed one day.

183
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,159
I still prefer to avenge

184
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:12,039
on my own.

185
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:14,720
I'm not capable like you.

186
00:09:15,039 --> 00:09:16,320
Since I can take advantage of it,

187
00:09:16,559 --> 00:09:18,039
why do I have to look for a long way?

188
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,360
Whether it's the pear I cut myself

189
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,720
or someone else cut it and sent it to me,

190
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,759
as long as I'm the one who eats the pear

191
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,600
it's fine.

192
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,720
Don't think that you can escape

193
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,720
just because you made a deal with me.

194
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:33,919
