1
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:54,000
A hundred miles ahead

2
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,280
Once you pass Shanyi Pass

3
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:56,520
It's no longer Yan territory

4
00:00:57,039 --> 00:00:57,679
Go now

5
00:00:58,719 --> 00:00:59,679
I don't want to see you again

6
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,159
Why not to kill me?

7
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:03,079
The mastermind's already been dealt with

8
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:04,400
Those who deserved death

9
00:01:04,599 --> 00:01:05,319
Those who needed investigating

10
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:06,640
Are mostly accounted for

11
00:01:07,319 --> 00:01:08,599
For informants in treason cases

12
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:10,480
I have discretion to show leniency

13
00:01:10,719 --> 00:01:11,760
To spare her life

14
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,920
You know

15
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,680
After your "death"

16
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:20,000
I received an anonymous tip-off

17
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:23,599
The letter listed every spy hidden in Yan

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,799
One by one

19
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,719
Saved me a lot of trouble

20
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:29,959
That letter

21
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:31,560
Was sent by you, wasn't it?

22
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,200
I just wanted a fresh start

23
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,159
Anyone who knows my true identity

24
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,439
Can't be left alive

25
00:01:42,519 --> 00:01:44,359
So you only dared show yourself

26
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,879
After Fan Xingchen was imprisoned

27
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,560
I was afraid if I waited longer

28
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,519
You'd fall for someone else

29
00:01:52,599 --> 00:01:53,480
Never imagined

30
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,640
I was still too late

31
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,439
Even though you avenged me

32
00:02:03,879 --> 00:02:05,319
You fell for her

33
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,400
How ridiculous

34
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,599
Between me and her

35
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,159
It was just an act to uncover the truth

36
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,039
A pretense

37
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:15,719
As for you and me

38
00:02:16,039 --> 00:02:17,599
Let's pretend we never knew each other

39
00:02:18,520 --> 00:02:19,479
From now on

40
00:02:19,919 --> 00:02:20,800
Take care of yourself

41
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,639
I love the color of snow most

42
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:13,759
When mother was still here, she told me

43
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,520
To live is

44
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,919
To summon the bright moon above

45
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:21,879
Illuminating my heart filled with ice and snow

46
00:03:24,719 --> 00:03:25,879
The snow in the capital

47
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,479
And the snow in Mobei

48
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:29,879
Are completely different

49
00:03:49,199 --> 00:03:51,000
Did you ever truly love me

50
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:54,960
Or the girl from the booklet I was imitating

51
00:04:18,800 --> 00:04:21,120
You dare claim ownership before me

52
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,120
Fan Xingxu loves me

53
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:26,279
What does it matter if you're a princess?

54
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:28,319
What does it matter?

55
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:31,199
I'm the cloud in the sky

56
00:04:31,959 --> 00:04:34,120
You're just dirt beneath your feet

57
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:36,199
The distance between us

58
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:38,240
Is something you'll never cross

59
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:39,480
Likewise

60
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:41,759
You and Marquis Weiyuan

61
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,480
Are absolutely impossible

62
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:52,079
Fine

63
00:04:54,480 --> 00:04:56,040
Then I'll wait and see

64
00:04:56,839 --> 00:04:59,439
Whether you, the princess, are all-powerful

65
00:04:59,879 --> 00:05:01,759
Or if he can truly protect me

66
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:02,560
You—

67
00:06:32,519 --> 00:06:33,759
Between you and her

68
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:35,319
It's not purely innocent

69
00:06:36,519 --> 00:06:37,920
The way you look at her

70
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:39,879
Leaves no room for anyone else

71
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:43,079
You risked everything to save her when she was in danger

72
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:45,720
You clearly fell for her long ago

73
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:47,959
Fan Xingxu

74
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,319
I won't remind you

75
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:53,240
Consider it my jealousy

76
00:06:53,879 --> 00:06:55,800
Giving you one last little revenge

77
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,519
How noble of you

78
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:02,959
To spare her life

79
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:04,879
Her confession helped

80
00:07:04,959 --> 00:07:05,800
It made up for her crime

81
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:08,000
Ultimately

82
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,839
We just served different masters

83
00:07:11,079 --> 00:07:12,920
How did you know she was a spy？

84
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:22,240
This isn't—

85
00:07:22,480 --> 00:07:23,519
She's not from Yan

86
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,040
Her past story

87
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
Was pieced together

88
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:28,480
Mostly from tales in this booklet

89
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,439
This isn't a story

90
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,279
This is—

91
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,240
What is it?

92
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:40,680
So who you loved

93
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,480
Was her imitation of

94
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:45,199
The owner of this booklet

95
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:48,800
I don't know

96
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,240
What exactly does it mean?

97
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:04,519
Do you love her or not

98
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:05,480
You don't know?

99
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,399
That man

100
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,639
Is as slow as me when it comes to feelings

101
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:10,920
Clueless

102
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,000
It's normal he doesn't know

103
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,920
Ugh, so annoying

104
00:08:15,439 --> 00:08:16,519
Who he loves or doesn't love

105
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:17,439
Why he loves them

106
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,720
What does it have to do with me?

107
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:20,600
Why should I be troubled by this?

108
00:08:22,199 --> 00:08:22,800
Right

109
00:08:22,959 --> 00:08:24,000
None of my business

110
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,279
What does it have to do with me?

111
00:08:25,560 --> 00:08:26,240
Right now

112
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,720
I just need to get the divorce papers

113
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,279
And leave Marquis Weiyuan's estate

114
00:08:29,439 --> 00:08:30,199
Yes

115
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:32,279
Who？

116
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,559
It's me

117
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,159
It's late

118
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:38,639
I need to talk to you

119
00:08:46,960 --> 00:08:47,919
What is it

120
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,120
What I promised you

121
00:08:57,559 --> 00:08:58,440
The divorce papers

122
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,399
Here are the storeroom keys

123
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:03,879
As agreed

124
00:09:04,559 --> 00:09:06,039
You can take half the family assets

125
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:07,240
And your dowry

126
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:09,639
Are you really keeping your word?

127
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,200
You thought I'd break the agreement?

128
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:15,559
No

129
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,039
I just didn't expect you to be so straightforward

130
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:20,840
Because He Weilan upset you

131
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:21,960
You acted impulsively

132
00:09:22,039 --> 00:09:23,240
Trying to play the generous fool

133
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:25,960
Do you want it?

134
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:28,000
How could I refuse?

135
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:29,840
Since you're being so generous

136
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:31,360
It'd be rude to decline

137
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,519
Then tomorrow

138
00:09:35,919 --> 00:09:36,960
I won't see you off

139
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:38,799
Madam

140
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:40,879
Do you regret knowing the truth?

141
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,879
She'd cleared her name

142
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:46,120
You could've turned a blind eye

143
00:09:46,879 --> 00:09:47,639
I think

144
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,240
Her feelings for you were genuine

145
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:54,240
If I were an ordinary person

146
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,200
I might have let it go

147
00:09:57,039 --> 00:09:58,120
But I'm not

148
00:09:59,559 --> 00:10:01,039
My position demands responsibility

149
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:02,840
Behind me

150
00:10:02,960 --> 00:10:04,759
Stands the entire Fan family and Yan

151
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,159
I can't afford to lose

152
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,159
Anything suspicious

153
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,720
Happening around me

154
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,240
Is a potential conspiracy

155
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:17,240
By the way

156
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:19,960
What you asked me in the carriage today

157
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,039
I still have no answer

158
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:23,360
Perhaps

159
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,519
I didn't love her as much as I thought

160
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:29,480
Perhaps she truly cared for me

161
00:10:31,559 --> 00:10:32,519
But now

162
00:10:32,759 --> 00:10:34,080
None of that matters

163
00:10:35,399 --> 00:10:36,120
From now on

164
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,600
We won't meet again

165
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,200
You can live in peace again

166
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:26,399
The owner of that booklet

167
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,200
Is me

168
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:29,639
I lost it by accident

169
00:13:30,279 --> 00:13:31,320
I always felt

170
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,759
We were strangely alike in some ways

171
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,559
Now I know

172
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:38,000
It's because she found my things

173
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:39,240
So

174
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,519
You fell for a real person

175
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,200
Not an illusion

176
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:47,840
I swear

177
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,559
Though I lie constantly

178
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,200
This time I'm telling the truth

179
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,960
I know

180
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:54,759
You know

181
00:13:58,840 --> 00:14:00,799
Ever since I found that booklet

182
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,960
I knew it was you

183
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,639
Fan Xingxu

184
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:08,080
I think I've fallen for you a little

185
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:09,519
I'm not leaving

186
00:14:09,720 --> 00:14:10,840
I'm staying

187
00:14:40,879 --> 00:14:42,039
Didn't you say

188
00:14:42,960 --> 00:14:44,759
You'd never love someone who hurt you

189
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:46,279
Yes

190
00:14:47,399 --> 00:14:48,840
I used to hate you deeply

191
00:14:49,600 --> 00:14:50,840
Hated how ruthless

192
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,080
How merciless you were

193
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:53,799
But

194
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:55,960
After truly knowing you

195
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,759
Facing life and death together

196
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,799
I stopped feeling that way

197
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,279
Stepping back

198
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:05,799
If I hadn't foolishly taken the blame for others

199
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:07,320
You wouldn't have—

200
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:09,360
I don't care

201
00:15:09,679 --> 00:15:10,240
When you said

202
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:12,799
We'd never meet again

203
00:15:13,559 --> 00:15:15,159
I suddenly couldn't bear it

204
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,480
Fan Xingxu

205
00:15:18,639 --> 00:15:19,759
I like you

206
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,080
Although

207
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:23,080
It's not love yet

208
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,960
But I really, really like you

209
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:27,919
I'm someone

210
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,600
Who dislikes beating around the bush

211
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:30,480
Hiding feelings

212
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,480
Since I know I like you

213
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,320
I must say it out loud

214
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,399
But

215
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:43,279
I'm not sure

216
00:15:52,679 --> 00:15:53,279
I'm sorry

217
00:15:54,879 --> 00:15:56,679
I can't make the same mistake again

218
00:15:57,759 --> 00:15:59,080
I don't want to deceive you

219
00:16:01,799 --> 00:16:02,919
I'm confused now

220
00:16:03,679 --> 00:16:05,600
I don't know what truly loving someone means

221
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:12,840
So you mean

222
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,519
You don't know if you like me

223
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,200
But it doesn't mean

224
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:18,759
You dislike me

225
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:21,279
If not—

226
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:24,240
I don't want to hurt you again

227
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:26,440
Husband

228
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:29,320
Though my heart's been wounded before

229
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:31,159
I'm not fragile

230
00:16:34,799 --> 00:16:36,320
I'll show you my sincerity

231
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:37,960
And I want

232
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:40,039
You to see your own heart clearly too

233
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:45,080
Don't push me away

234
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:47,799
Just feel it
