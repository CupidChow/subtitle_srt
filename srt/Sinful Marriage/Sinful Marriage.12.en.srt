1
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,240
My lady, you've stripped me down like this

2
00:00:59,439 --> 00:01:01,119
Aren't you afraid of what I might do to you?

3
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,120
In your state, you still have the heart to joke?

4
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:06,319
Looking like this

5
00:01:06,599 --> 00:01:07,959
Even if you wanted to do something to me

6
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:09,280
You wouldn't have the strength

7
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,280
Since you knew the Princess Nine was targeting me

8
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:14,000
And even prepared for it in advance

9
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:16,239
How did you fail to anticipate hidden experts?

10
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,840
Did you think

11
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,040
That once the Princess admitted to killing Weilan herself

12
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:23,280
You'd be absolved of guilt?

13
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:25,239
Isn't that so?

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,840
I risked my life

15
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:29,159
I finally got the truth out of her

16
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,040
Isn't that proof enough of my innocence?

17
00:01:31,519 --> 00:01:32,640
Are you blind and deaf?

18
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:34,760
Your lover's death indeed has unanswered questions

19
00:01:35,599 --> 00:01:37,480
But that doesn't give you, Marquis Weiyuan, the right

20
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,319
To twist facts against me!

21
00:01:38,599 --> 00:01:39,400
Remember this

22
00:01:40,359 --> 00:01:41,879
It was you who led me on

23
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:44,079
Your life

24
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,480
Is still in my hands

25
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:46,799
You...

26
00:01:47,760 --> 00:01:48,920
Pull out the arrow

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,760
If you don't want me to die

28
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:57,120
Do it quickly

29
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:00,079
Just now you said my life was in your hands

30
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:02,640
You really aren't afraid I'll harm you?

31
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,280
No

32
00:02:46,439 --> 00:02:47,520
Fan Xingxu...

33
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:54,639
It's hot!

34
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:12,680
I...

35
00:03:13,479 --> 00:03:14,599
Saw you were uncomfortable...

36
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:15,439
So...

37
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:16,639
Shen Yuanzhi

38
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,080
You're truly detestable

39
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:22,080
I know

40
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,680
You don't just dislike me...

41
00:03:23,919 --> 00:03:25,080
You utterly despise me

42
00:03:26,199 --> 00:03:27,400
You don't need to remind me

43
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:29,120
I know it well

44
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,120
You don't know...

45
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:33,240
Several times...

46
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:35,680
I wished I could just...

47
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,000
Fan Xingxu

48
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,159
You forced me

49
00:03:47,759 --> 00:03:49,120
I just want to survive

50
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:51,120
Don't blame me

51
00:04:00,759 --> 00:04:01,599
Luckily

52
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:04,280
I didn't kill you

53
00:04:05,719 --> 00:04:07,039
I'm sorry

54
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:19,800
If he dies from his wounds

55
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:20,600
If he dies here

56
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:21,839
I'd become a widow

57
00:04:22,519 --> 00:04:24,920
Not only would I escape the Marquis' residence without effort

58
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,360
I wouldn't have to risk cooperating with Fan Xingchen anymore

59
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:29,800
But today

60
00:04:29,879 --> 00:04:30,959
If he hadn't saved me

61
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:32,839
I'd probably be dead already

62
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,240
No!

63
00:04:34,519 --> 00:04:35,160
Shen Yuanzhi

64
00:04:35,519 --> 00:04:36,319
Snap out of it

65
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,759
If he didn't exist

66
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:39,879
You wouldn't be in this mess to begin with

67
00:05:22,839 --> 00:05:23,720
Are you alright?

68
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,120
Just now, you...

69
00:05:26,120 --> 00:05:27,560
I just went out to get some water

70
00:05:28,079 --> 00:05:28,759
Unfortunately

71
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:30,040
I spilled it

72
00:05:31,879 --> 00:05:32,600
It's fine

73
00:05:33,399 --> 00:05:35,319
This hunting ground has many beasts

74
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,199
Don't leave my sight

75
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,040
So cold...

76
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:08,800
We are couple

77
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:10,240
Facing disaster together

78
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,560
Let's just help each other out

79
00:07:30,759 --> 00:07:31,360
Um...

80
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:32,199
Last night...

81
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,079
It snowed

82
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:34,720
So...

83
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:42,519
Let's go

84
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:43,480
We need to get out of here fast

85
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:44,560
And find a doctor

86
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:06,040
Put me down

87
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:07,720
Go on without me

88
00:08:08,519 --> 00:08:09,319
No!

89
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:10,879
I won't abandon you

90
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:17,439
Aren't you afraid

91
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,360
That if I hold onto you

92
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:21,120
I'll never let go?

93
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:25,120
If I die...

94
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,279
You'll be free

95
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:29,720
If I abandon you here

96
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,919
And if by some miracle you don't die

97
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:35,360
Wouldn't that make me utterly despicable?

98
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:37,600
Rest assured

99
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:38,759
Saving you

100
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:39,919
Isn't for your sake

101
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,919
I just don't want to leave a future problem for myself

102
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:46,919
Consider it

103
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,039
Paying you back for taking that arrow

104
00:08:52,159 --> 00:08:53,240
Give me your hand

105
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,080
What are you doing?

106
00:09:10,639 --> 00:09:11,879
This is my personal seal

107
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:14,480
If anything happens to me

108
00:09:15,159 --> 00:09:16,360
Give this to Hawkeye

109
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,840
He'll know what to do

110
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,799
Something this important to you

111
00:09:33,039 --> 00:09:34,559
You're really giving it to me?

112
00:09:35,799 --> 00:09:37,360
Just hold onto it for me temporarily

113
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,720
Once we reach safety

114
00:09:40,679 --> 00:09:42,000
You can return it to me

115
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:44,919
Let's go

116
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,200
We're here!

117
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,399
I'll fetch the doctor!

118
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,200
Imperial Guards

119
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:16,879
His Majesty has arrived!

120
00:10:19,039 --> 00:10:19,679
Marquis Weiyuan!

121
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:21,279
We are stationed here by Imperial Decree

122
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,519
The hunting ground is now sealed

123
00:10:22,559 --> 00:10:23,919
Everyone must return for questioning

124
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:25,279
What happened?

125
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:25,919
Yesterday

126
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:27,960
The Princess Nine was ambushed and killed within the grounds

127
00:10:41,759 --> 00:10:43,279
The envoy, drunk and disorderly

128
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,679
Murdered my Great Yan's Princess

129
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,480
Such wanton arrogance

130
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:49,039
Deserves execution

131
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,200
I didn't kill anyone!

132
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,559
It wasn't me!

133
00:10:52,679 --> 00:10:53,159
Your Majesty!

134
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:55,399
There are still many unresolved questions

135
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:56,440
What questions?

136
00:10:56,679 --> 00:10:58,279
She died inside his tent

137
00:10:58,559 --> 00:11:00,080
He was passed out drunk

138
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,240
The ground

139
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:02,879
Was covered in her blood

140
00:11:03,559 --> 00:11:04,799
The Princess Nine

141
00:11:04,919 --> 00:11:06,960
Was indeed spoiled by me and could be willful

142
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,320
But she was still my sister

143
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:10,879
A Princess of Great Yan

144
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,919
The pain of losing my sister

145
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:14,679
How can I bear it?

146
00:11:15,679 --> 00:11:17,240
Those so-called experts

147
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,840
On the surface were the  Princess Nine's men

148
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,919
But their real purpose was to delay us

149
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:21,840
A diversion

150
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:22,759
To sabotage the peace talks

151
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:23,720
Your Majesty

152
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:25,159
The peace talks

153
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:26,679
Concern the welfare of both nations' people

154
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,559
If the envoy is truly involved

155
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:29,840
Judgment can still be passed later

156
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:30,279
That's possible

157
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:31,559
The evidence is conclusive

158
00:11:31,759 --> 00:11:32,960
Who else could it be?

159
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
The talks are off

160
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:36,320
If he is not brought to justice

161
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,279
How can I face my sister's ghost?

162
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,120
This man is guilty of a capital crime

163
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:40,879
He must die

164
00:11:41,039 --> 00:11:42,039
As a warning

165
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:44,519
Only then can I ease the hatred in my heart

166
00:11:44,879 --> 00:11:46,080
I didn't kill her!

167
00:11:46,759 --> 00:11:48,960
I don't know why the Princess Nine was in my tent!

168
00:11:50,159 --> 00:11:50,679
Your Majesty

169
00:11:51,639 --> 00:11:52,480
The peace talks

170
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:53,840
Have been under my charge

171
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,200
Yesterday

172
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,360
The Princess met her end

173
00:11:56,639 --> 00:11:57,320
I...

174
00:11:57,840 --> 00:11:58,919
Am responsible

175
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:05,200
I pledge my position as Marquis Weiyuan

176
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:07,759
And humbly request Your Majesty grant me three days

177
00:12:07,919 --> 00:12:08,840
To uncover the truth

178
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:10,360
And give Your Majesty a full account

179
00:12:10,879 --> 00:12:12,840
If I cannot clear the  Princess Nine's name

180
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:13,600
I...

181
00:12:13,919 --> 00:12:15,480
Shall submit to Your Majesty's judgment
