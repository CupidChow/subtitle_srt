1
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,119
I've asked

2
00:00:57,399 --> 00:00:58,560
everyone I can think of,

3
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,439
but no one knows

4
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,359
why the horse went crazy.

5
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,079
There must be something behind it.

6
00:01:08,239 --> 00:01:08,719
Sir.

7
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:09,000
Yes?

8
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,000
Do you know anything about

9
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:11,760
the horse collision here?

10
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:12,799
No.

11
00:01:13,519 --> 00:01:14,000
Thank you.

12
00:01:15,719 --> 00:01:16,719
Please take a look.

13
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:17,359
Floral cloth.

14
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,400
Floral cloth.

15
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,879
Come and take a look.

16
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,200
Hello.

17
00:01:23,799 --> 00:01:25,840
Do you know about the horse collision

18
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:26,680
that happened here a few days ago?

19
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:27,879
I don't know.

20
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:29,120
Thank you.

21
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,480
Sure to sell her to Zuige Pavilion?

22
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:45,200
She is the wife of Marquis Wei Yuan now.

23
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,359
If Fan Xingxu finds out...

24
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,319
So what?

25
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:51,200
Even if Fan Xingxu finds her,

26
00:01:51,799 --> 00:01:53,560
her reputation is already ruined.

27
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:55,680
How could the Wei family allow

28
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,280
a prostitute to enter?

29
00:01:58,040 --> 00:01:59,920
Now someone wants her dead.

30
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:00,799
We

31
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:02,719
is just a convenient excuse.

32
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:14,759
Anyone in the way will die.

33
00:02:58,199 --> 00:02:59,039
Fan Xingxu,

34
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,039
help me!

35
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:05,599
Shen Yuanzhi,

36
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:07,439
wake up!

37
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,639
Fan Xingxu!

38
00:03:10,479 --> 00:03:11,319
It's so hot!

39
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:13,319
Shen Yuanzhi,

40
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,479
come on!

41
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:16,039
Who did this?

42
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:19,360
So hot!

43
00:03:20,759 --> 00:03:21,520
Save...

44
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,039
Save me.

45
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,280
You...

46
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,199
So heavy.

47
00:03:46,199 --> 00:03:47,800
How much does Fan Xingxu love you?

48
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,560
He loves you so much that no matter what,

49
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:50,879
he won't divorce you.

50
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,639
That's what you mean,

51
00:03:53,479 --> 00:03:54,120
right?

52
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:55,360
Love...

53
00:03:56,759 --> 00:03:58,319
No matter how you understand,

54
00:03:58,520 --> 00:04:00,120
this is my current predicament.

55
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:02,680
I know your feelings for Fan Xingxu.

56
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:04,479
Since everyone has their own needs,

57
00:04:04,759 --> 00:04:06,599
why can't we be on the same boat?

58
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,479
He's just a man.

59
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,240
If you want him,

60
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:10,479
just take him.

61
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:18,160
You...

62
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,199
Twice is enough, not thrice.

63
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,279
or the deal won't go through.

64
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,439
No matter how noble you are,

65
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,079
you'll be tormented

66
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,959
by unrequited love.

67
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,040
Love unreturned.

68
00:04:29,399 --> 00:04:30,759
You're insulting me.

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:35,680
I'm helping you.

70
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,720
To get close to Fan Xingxu,

71
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,560
to join the Wei Yuan Marquisate,

72
00:04:40,199 --> 00:04:41,600
and to take your place

73
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:43,839
as the marquise of the Marquisate.

74
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,759
All I need is one reason.

75
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,120
a reason to ask for a divorce

76
00:04:47,399 --> 00:04:49,000
and leave smoothly.

77
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:51,319
What do you want to do?

78
00:04:58,120 --> 00:04:58,839
I'm sorry.

79
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:00,360
You don't want to let me go.

80
00:05:00,480 --> 00:05:01,720
I just want to protect myself.

81
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,199
Drugs on your teeth?

82
00:05:14,759 --> 00:05:15,720
I've proved that

83
00:05:15,959 --> 00:05:17,399
it can last for at least half a day.

84
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:18,759
How did you

85
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:20,959
I've been on the battlefield.

86
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:22,800
I've been drugged

87
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,480
hundreds of times.

88
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,519
I'm used to it.

89
00:05:35,279 --> 00:05:36,800
You're so vengeful.

90
00:05:38,519 --> 00:05:39,600
Isn't it

91
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,839
a pleasure to revenge?

92
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,079
Don't forget that

93
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,319
you owe me a life.

94
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,120
Princess Nine,

95
00:05:47,279 --> 00:05:48,279
Princess Nine, you can't enter!

96
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:49,800
Princess Nine,

97
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,680
please be mindful of your behavior.

98
00:05:59,399 --> 00:06:00,319
Shen Yuanzhi,

99
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,959
how dare you play me?

100
00:06:02,879 --> 00:06:04,600
Didn't you say you'd get Fan Xingxu...

101
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,680
Get him what?

102
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,160
To her bed!

103
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:08,040
Your Highness,

104
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:10,959
whatever she said

105
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,720
was just to provoke me.

106
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:14,959
Princess Nine hasn't been married yet.

107
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:17,120
You don't understand the fun between couples.

108
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,480
Sorry to have embarrassed you.

109
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:20,439
Your Highness,

110
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:21,639
and

111
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,959
it's better for you

112
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,560
to visit places like Zuige Pavilion less often,

113
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:27,519
to avoid gossip

114
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,000
and damage your reputation.

115
00:06:30,360 --> 00:06:30,839
Your Highness,

116
00:06:32,839 --> 00:06:33,399
please.

117
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:35,399
Okay.

118
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:37,959
You two are one,

119
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:39,639
and humiliated me.

120
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:41,879
For today's disgrace,

121
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:42,959
I will

122
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,800
make you pay a hundredfold!

123
00:06:46,399 --> 00:06:47,199
Princess Jiu,

124
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,199
please close the door for us.

125
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:01,480
So,

126
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:02,879
you're doing all this today

127
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,480
just to get me out

128
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:06,920
to divorce me over this?

129
00:07:10,399 --> 00:07:11,959
She's the Emperor's sister.

130
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:14,680
If I truly had something with her,

131
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,000
I'd have to take on this hot potato.

132
00:07:20,959 --> 00:07:22,639
Though the method is unseemly,

133
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,439
it's a good strategy.

134
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:28,560
As if forcing me to marry you

135
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,399
is more acceptable?

136
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:32,399
There's more to it, isn't there?

137
00:07:32,879 --> 00:07:34,839
Qin and Gu Hengyuan

138
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:37,120
are also your doing, right?

139
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,279
understand?

140
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:42,600
I'll leave it to you.

141
00:07:49,279 --> 00:07:51,079
You bribed the manager of Zuige Pavilion,

142
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:53,759
making Qin think you offended someone

143
00:07:53,879 --> 00:07:55,360
and that someone wanted to harm you.

144
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:59,120
She'll be willing to be the knife.

145
00:08:01,079 --> 00:08:02,639
If you report it after the fact,

146
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,480
they can't escape their involvement.

147
00:08:07,439 --> 00:08:08,680
The mantis catches the cicada,

148
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,920
but the cicada wants to eat the mantis.

149
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,759
Since you're taking such a big risk,

150
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:22,480
it would be better

151
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,560
to drag more people into it.

152
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,439
It's a pity

153
00:08:25,959 --> 00:08:27,160
that I don't know you well enough.

154
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,560
There's always a flaw in the best-laid plans.

155
00:08:34,879 --> 00:08:36,120
Since the founding of our dynasty,

156
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:37,919
I can't find a more generous

157
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:39,480
first wife than you.

158
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,120
For your own selfish interests,

159
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:43,919
to set your husband up

160
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,440
with someone else?

161
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,799
If we were in your position,

162
00:08:47,919 --> 00:08:50,720
we would be disgusted by your behavior.

163
00:08:56,159 --> 00:08:57,840
How can we be in your position?

164
00:08:58,799 --> 00:09:00,600
The standards for men and women

165
00:09:00,679 --> 00:09:01,799
have never been equal.

166
00:09:02,639 --> 00:09:04,399
Abandoning women for horses

167
00:09:04,759 --> 00:09:06,200
doesn't hinder men's achievements

168
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:07,600
or their legacy, does it?

169
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:08,919
A woman

170
00:09:09,159 --> 00:09:11,000
who sleeps with a second man

171
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:12,480
is immoral

172
00:09:12,519 --> 00:09:13,320
and unfaithful.

173
00:09:14,759 --> 00:09:16,919
But a man who sleeps with

174
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:18,039
a hundred or a thousand women,

175
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:19,840
what is he?

176
00:09:21,080 --> 00:09:23,679
He is the most respected person

177
00:09:24,039 --> 00:09:25,799
with a harem of thousands of beauties.

178
00:09:27,039 --> 00:09:28,320
You're crazy.

179
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:31,679
Don't speak

180
00:09:31,879 --> 00:09:32,919
such rebellious words again.

181
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,279
Let me go!

182
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:41,559
My Lord!

183
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:42,159
Fan Xingxu!

184
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:43,360
Let me go!

185
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:44,279
My Lord!

186
00:09:44,639 --> 00:09:45,720
The bait we set out before

187
00:09:45,799 --> 00:09:46,440
has returned with news.

188
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,200
Fan Xingxu!

189
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,240
Let me down!

190
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:02,480
Shen Yuanzhi,

191
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:04,120
you underestimated him.

192
00:10:04,759 --> 00:10:05,720
He deserves it.
