1
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:07,680
Hya!

2
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,760
I love riding and shooting

3
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:23,840
Today

4
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:25,400
You are my prey

5
00:01:25,959 --> 00:01:26,760
Don't worry

6
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,879
I'll leave you a whole body

7
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,480
You said you love riding and shooting

8
00:01:31,879 --> 00:01:33,239
But your shooting skills

9
00:01:33,480 --> 00:01:34,359
Are nothing special

10
00:01:35,799 --> 00:01:37,079
The last gasp of a dying man

11
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:39,319
You're still so annoying

12
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,840
You kill me today

13
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,640
Aren't you afraid that Fan Xingxu will find out

14
00:01:43,120 --> 00:01:44,359
And hate you?

15
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:47,760
I kill you

16
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,519
Today

17
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,599
After Marquis Wei Yuan left

18
00:01:52,519 --> 00:01:53,840
Horse panicked

19
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:56,359
And the Marquise...

20
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:58,680
Fled blindly into the mountains

21
00:01:59,079 --> 00:01:59,799
Finally

22
00:01:59,959 --> 00:02:01,439
Died by an arrow

23
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,959
I chased on horseback

24
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,319
But

25
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:07,920
Only found a corpse

26
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,240
This story

27
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,599
Is boring and cliche

28
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:19,800
Utterly unoriginal

29
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,360
I don't like it

30
00:02:22,919 --> 00:02:23,479
By the way

31
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,159
That story about He Weilan

32
00:02:25,159 --> 00:02:26,759
Dying in a street collision?

33
00:02:27,240 --> 00:02:28,840
Was also made by you, right?

34
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:31,479
Since we're here

35
00:02:32,159 --> 00:02:33,360
I'll tell you the truth

36
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,360
Let you die knowing

37
00:02:36,159 --> 00:02:37,840
That wretch He Weilan...

38
00:02:38,639 --> 00:02:40,039
Yes, I killed her

39
00:02:44,199 --> 00:02:46,120
I knew Fan Xingxu loved someone else

40
00:02:46,919 --> 00:02:48,560
But he protected her too well

41
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,479
I searched for a long time before I found her

42
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:16,479
All it took was a light shove

43
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:18,840
And she stumbled right under the horse

44
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:21,680
That horse

45
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:23,280
Was a mad beast

46
00:03:23,719 --> 00:03:25,560
No one could rein it in

47
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,639
See?

48
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:28,280
Fate's like that

49
00:03:28,919 --> 00:03:29,599
Some lives...

50
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:30,680
Are

51
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,080
Cheaper than grass

52
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:34,199
Huh

53
00:03:35,240 --> 00:03:37,120
A light shove?

54
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,960
But what truly surprises me

55
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,400
Is how poor his taste was

56
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,280
To fall for a

57
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,280
Worthless orphan girl?

58
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,240
Disappointing

59
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:50,039
Compared with you

60
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:52,159
I prefer you

61
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,240
At least

62
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,479
You're worthy as my opponent

63
00:03:56,520 --> 00:03:57,759
How flattering

64
00:03:58,719 --> 00:03:59,840
But I don't think

65
00:03:59,919 --> 00:04:01,199
You are my opponent

66
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,520
You look down on me?

67
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:06,599
Yes

68
00:04:07,199 --> 00:04:08,199
I look down on you

69
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:10,759
You're imperial royalty

70
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,240
The highest-born woman in the country

71
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:16,240
Wielding power beyond ordinary women's reach

72
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:17,639
Such authority...

73
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,680
Yet you don't fight men for influence

74
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:21,360
Or tangible gains

75
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:23,079
You waste it on jealousy

76
00:04:23,439 --> 00:04:24,800
Even breaking the law

77
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:27,600
To murder common women like yourself

78
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:28,360
That's why...

79
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,079
I look down on you

80
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:31,680
What would you know?!

81
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,759
Who are you to judge me?

82
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,360
Aren't you the same?

83
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:36,920
Fighting over a man

84
00:04:37,319 --> 00:04:38,519
Turning everything upside-down?

85
00:04:38,519 --> 00:04:39,480
Trapped yourself?

86
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,560
Seems Madam Qin sold me out completely

87
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,439
Yes

88
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,040
So I told that worthless man to get lost

89
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:49,319
What about you, Your Highness?

90
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:51,560
You could let go of Fan Xingxu

91
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,120
Spare a few lives

92
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,639
And earn some karma

93
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:56,480
I never wanted to be your enemy

94
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,319
Finished talking?

95
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,160
If you are—

96
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,480
Go to hell!

97
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:14,160
Enjoyed the show?

98
00:05:14,319 --> 00:05:15,240
Finally showing yourself?

99
00:05:15,879 --> 00:05:17,000
You're deceiving me

100
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:19,600
You schemed Weilan’s death!

101
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:21,399
No!

102
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:22,639
It wasn't me!

103
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,319
I was just talking nonsense!

104
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:25,360
It was her!

105
00:05:25,959 --> 00:05:27,120
She was the one who lied!

106
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,600
She's the murderer!

107
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:33,240
You want to kill me?

108
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,319
I'm the princess!

109
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:40,199
You want to kill me for a commoner?

110
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,000
These men—

111
00:05:44,519 --> 00:05:46,680
Are elite fighters I handpicked

112
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:47,759
Even you...

113
00:05:48,399 --> 00:05:50,680
Won't escape unscathed easily

114
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,240
Especially...

115
00:05:52,879 --> 00:05:54,279
Dragging her along

116
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:56,839
No

117
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:13,920
Go!

118
00:06:16,279 --> 00:06:16,839
After them!

119
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:18,240
Kill them!

120
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,199
Leave none alive!

121
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:36,079
You're injured

122
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:37,519
Just go

123
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:46,800
Elite fighters?

124
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:48,199
A bunch of losers

125
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,079
Still haven't finished them off

126
00:06:54,279 --> 00:06:57,000
Agh!!!!
