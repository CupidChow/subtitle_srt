1
00:01:00,159 --> 00:01:01,000
Does it hurt badly?

2
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,319
Are you concerned about me?

3
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:11,280
I just feel terribly sorry for myself

4
00:01:12,319 --> 00:01:13,319
Since I met you

5
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,879
I've lost count of how much pain like this I've endured

6
00:01:16,599 --> 00:01:17,920
My body and skin belong to me

7
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:19,680
Yet I failed to protect myself

8
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:21,280
Well

9
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:24,920
Always putting yourself first

10
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,439
Your crime—

11
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:27,560
It wasn't suffered in vain

12
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:32,799
Alright

13
00:01:33,879 --> 00:01:34,799
Rest well

14
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:35,680
I'll take my leave

15
00:01:41,319 --> 00:01:42,079
Stay

16
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:45,519
Stay for what?

17
00:01:46,519 --> 00:01:46,959
Don't misunderstand

18
00:01:48,959 --> 00:01:50,959
The killer of Princess Nine hasn't been found yet

19
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,519
And I'm investigating this matter

20
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,200
Just to be safe

21
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,480
You shouldn't be alone

22
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:03,120
So you were worried about me

23
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:05,719
Don't misunderstand

24
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:06,879
Actually, I—

25
00:02:06,879 --> 00:02:07,439
I know

26
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,759
Though you are ruthless

27
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:11,120
Your devotion runs deep

28
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:12,800
Apart from He Weilan

29
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:14,680
No room for another woman in your heart

30
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,159
I won't misinterpret your intentions

31
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:40,120
What are you doing?

32
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,479
Too much has happened these past few days

33
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,039
I'm a little scared

34
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,199
When my mother was still alive

35
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:00,280
She would hold my hand until I fell asleep

36
00:03:00,719 --> 00:03:01,199
That way

37
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,039
I could sleep peacefully

38
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:29,439
The thing you wanted

39
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,120
Beauty truly is a calamity

40
00:03:34,719 --> 00:03:36,400
Even Fan Xingxu can't escape it

41
00:03:37,159 --> 00:03:38,479
If beauties are calamities

42
00:03:38,919 --> 00:03:40,719
Then aren't all men just disasters?

43
00:03:41,479 --> 00:03:42,879
These are just excuses

44
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,280
Used by failed men

45
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:45,639
Of course

46
00:03:45,879 --> 00:03:47,120
Brother-in-law, you are different from them

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,280
I firmly believe

48
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:49,159
In your talent

49
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:50,639
Your future is limitless

50
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:52,800
Once the major matter is settled

51
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:54,919
Don't forget our agreement

52
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:56,360
Naturally not

53
00:03:57,159 --> 00:03:58,240
As for Fan Xingxu

54
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,159
He's busy with the Princess Nine affair

55
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:01,639
Before he notices anything

56
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,199
You'd best act quickly

57
00:04:13,080 --> 00:04:13,960
Marquis Weiyuan!

58
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,480
Is this the result of your investigation?

59
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:19,360
Your Majesty

60
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:21,120
This case

61
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:23,279
Was clearly someone deliberately murdering Princess

62
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:24,439
And framing the envoy

63
00:04:24,959 --> 00:04:25,480
The purpose

64
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,079
Was to sabotage the peace talks

65
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,319
Plunging both nations into hatred

66
00:04:29,439 --> 00:04:30,600
What evidence do you have?

67
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:32,720
According to the coroner's careful examination

68
00:04:33,519 --> 00:04:35,000
Princess Nine's cause of death was asphyxiation

69
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:37,120
Likely caused by someone choking her neck

70
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,560
Leading to death from inability to breathe

71
00:04:38,839 --> 00:04:40,040
I already know all this

72
00:04:40,879 --> 00:04:41,680
I discovered

73
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:42,879
The Princess's neck

74
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:43,600
Wrists

75
00:04:43,839 --> 00:04:44,720
Scalp, and other places

76
00:04:44,879 --> 00:04:46,279
All bear very fine wounds

77
00:04:46,879 --> 00:04:47,759
And these wounds

78
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:49,759
Came from the hunting ground's thorns

79
00:04:49,959 --> 00:04:50,879
So what?

80
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:52,959
She entered the grounds to hunt

81
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:54,720
Getting scratched by thorns—

82
00:04:54,959 --> 00:04:56,240
What's so strange about that?

83
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,079
Indeed, nothing strange

84
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,399
But what if

85
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:02,600
These wounds appeared after her death?

86
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:05,519
A living person's blood flows quickly

87
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:06,959
After injury

88
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:08,360
It bleeds profusely

89
00:05:09,879 --> 00:05:11,560
But a corpse is very different

90
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,720
Blood flow is slow

91
00:05:13,839 --> 00:05:14,839
And its color

92
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,519
Differs from wounds healing on a living person

93
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:18,720
Therefore, I conclude

94
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:21,079
The wounds on Princess Nine's body

95
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:24,160
Appeared at least two hours after her death

96
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,480
You mean to say

97
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:28,399
Before the envoy entered the tent

98
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,279
Princess Nine

99
00:05:29,399 --> 00:05:30,160
Was already dead?

100
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:31,480
And Princess Nine

101
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,959
Did not die from the envoy's drunken mistake

102
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:35,199
But during the day

103
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,839
Already died in the hunting grounds

104
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:38,879
The murderer dragged her body

105
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,120
Back from the woods

106
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:41,720
And placed it in the envoy's quarters

107
00:05:42,279 --> 00:05:42,879
Furthermore

108
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:44,680
I discovered

109
00:05:44,959 --> 00:05:46,360
That in the envoy's wine

110
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:47,680
Someone deliberately drugged it

111
00:05:47,959 --> 00:05:48,920
To render him unconscious

112
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:51,079
I have captured the person who drugged it

113
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,600
Unfortunately

114
00:05:53,439 --> 00:05:54,920
He was bribed by letter

115
00:05:55,079 --> 00:05:56,279
And never met the person who bribed him

116
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,439
Vile!

117
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,680
Who on earth is it?

118
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:01,519
The Empress Dowager has arrived!

119
00:06:05,399 --> 00:06:06,079
Mother!

120
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:07,519
Long live the Empress Dowager!

121
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,160
Enough

122
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,720
All rise

123
00:06:15,879 --> 00:06:17,120
Just now, I

124
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:20,079
Heard everything clearly outside

125
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:22,600
My daughter

126
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,199
Had only just come of age

127
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:27,519
Yet suffered such a cruel fate

128
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,079
She died in such agony

129
00:06:31,439 --> 00:06:32,439
I...

130
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,000
Cannot rest or eat in peace

131
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:38,680
The Marquis Weiyuan claims

132
00:06:38,879 --> 00:06:41,920
Someone used my daughter's death to sabotage the peace talks

133
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,319
I find that rather doubtful

134
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,439
Because these peace talks

135
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,959
Were overseen by you

136
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:52,560
The envoy delegation was also your responsibility

137
00:06:52,839 --> 00:06:53,720
This matter

138
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,519
Benefits you greatly

139
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:58,319
It's hard to guarantee you wouldn't deliberately shield him

140
00:06:58,759 --> 00:06:59,800
Moreover, before

141
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:01,240
My daughter was confined

142
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:03,000
The root cause

143
00:07:03,319 --> 00:07:06,079
Also stemmed from you and your wife

144
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:10,079
Your investigation results—

145
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:11,600
I don't believe them

146
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,759
Mother

147
00:07:13,959 --> 00:07:14,879
This matter—

148
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:24,079
Your Majesty!

149
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,160
Urgent report from the border!

150
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,000
The Marquis Weiyuan mobilized troops without authorization

151
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:28,639
Leaving the defenses empty

152
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
Neighboring forces exploited the gap

153
00:07:30,199 --> 00:07:31,199
And invaded in force

154
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:32,600
Our troops were caught unprepared

155
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:33,879
Suffering heavy losses

156
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,319
The situation is extremely critical

157
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:36,959
We beg Your Majesty for orders!

158
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:37,839
Marquis Weiyuan!

159
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,160
What is the meaning of this?

160
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,600
The seal on this document is genuine

161
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,000
But this order was not sent by me

162
00:07:52,279 --> 00:07:53,000
Your Majesty

163
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:54,639
I accuse

164
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,879
Fan Xingxu of treason and collusion with the enemy

165
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,920
He colluded with the envoy long ago

166
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,199
Accepting bribes from him

167
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,279
To profit from the peace talks

168
00:08:03,160 --> 00:08:03,639
Furthermore

169
00:08:04,439 --> 00:08:05,319
The person he mentioned

170
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,279
The one who drugged the envoy

171
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,920
Was bribed by him to give false testimony—a scapegoat

172
00:08:10,079 --> 00:08:10,959
If Your Majesty doubts me

173
00:08:11,399 --> 00:08:12,920
Summon this person to court for questioning

174
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:13,839
Nonsense!

175
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,720
Your Majesty!

176
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:15,600
Your Majesty!

177
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:16,920
He is deliberately slandering me!

178
00:08:17,639 --> 00:08:18,240
Your Majesty!

179
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,000
I have something to report

180
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,040
This border document...

181
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,399
I saw it at the Marquis residence

182
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,240
Sent personally by my husband

183
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:33,080
I am filled with dread

184
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,120
But dare not conceal this

185
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,840
It concerns the welfare of both nations' people

186
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,240
I implore Your Majesty to investigate clearly

187
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,360
Fan Xingxu, Marquis Weiyuan

188
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:40,799
Acted without authorization to mobilize troops

189
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,240
Causing chaos on the border

190
00:08:42,679 --> 00:08:44,720
The envoy murdered Princess Nine

191
00:08:44,759 --> 00:08:46,240
And the Marquis deliberately shielded him

192
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:47,360
His crimes are unforgivable

193
00:08:47,639 --> 00:08:48,399
Effective immediately

194
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,519
He is stripped of his marquis title

195
00:08:49,679 --> 00:08:51,840
Arrest all related parties and imprison them!

196
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:52,840
Execution is ordered immediately!

197
00:09:12,399 --> 00:09:14,279
Playing both sides

198
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:15,559
Shifting with the wind—

199
00:09:15,919 --> 00:09:17,399
I overestimated you

200
00:09:19,399 --> 00:09:21,679
Aren't you always yearning for your beloved?

201
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:24,240
I only wanted to help you

202
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,320
To send you down to hell sooner

203
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,120
To reunite with your little lover!

204
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:35,519
Marquis Weiyuan!

205
00:09:35,639 --> 00:09:36,559
Have you gone mad?

206
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:38,360
Seize him at once!

207
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,039
Execute!

208
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:40,600
This went so smoothly

209
00:10:40,879 --> 00:10:42,799
Thanks to you misleading Fan Xingxu

210
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:44,720
Giving him false leads

211
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,120
When he captured me before

212
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,399
During the interrogation

213
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,000
I suffered greatly

214
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,240
If you hadn't rescued me

215
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:55,720
I wouldn't be here today

216
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,919
My superiors permit me to leave the residence in a few days

217
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,679
This Marquis residence

218
00:11:06,679 --> 00:11:08,480
Will soon be reclaimed by the court

219
00:11:10,919 --> 00:11:12,720
Once I retrieve my sister who is outside praying to Buddha

220
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:13,799
And my grandmother

221
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:15,679
I will take them away from Great Yan

222
00:11:17,799 --> 00:11:19,799
The new identity King Ning promised me

223
00:11:20,159 --> 00:11:20,960
And noble title—

224
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,279
Our Master does not wish the peace talks to succeed

225
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:25,240
You handled this matter very well

226
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,039
What he promised you before

227
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,639
He certainly won't forget

228
00:11:32,879 --> 00:11:33,840
This is the travel permit

229
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:36,279
Our Master prepared for you in advance

230
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,279
That's good

231
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,279
But before that

232
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,639
I have one more thing to do

233
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:46,120
What is it?

234
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:55,720
Brother-in-law, what is the meaning of this?

235
00:11:56,440 --> 00:11:57,639
Trying to silence the witness?

236
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,360
You're clever

237
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:02,000
But clever people often die young

238
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:12,600
Weren't you already—

239
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:14,440
I'm not dead

240
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,519
Are you very disappointed?

241
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:20,200
You played me!

242
00:12:22,519 --> 00:12:24,200
I had her approach you first

243
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,320
I had her deliberately reveal herself

244
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,399
And tell you her purpose

245
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:30,720
It was all just to dispel your suspicions

246
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:33,240
And make this act more convincing

247
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,440
You've always been arrogant

248
00:12:36,159 --> 00:12:38,360
Refusing to believe your own judgment could be wrong

249
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:41,360
Shen Yuanzhi!

250
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,840
He tried to kill you multiple times

251
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,840
Married you just to torment you daily!

252
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:46,960
Why are you still helping him?

253
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,360
It's not that I didn't want to cooperate with you

254
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:50,720
At the beginning

255
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:54,159
I truly intended to maneuver between you and him for profit

256
00:12:54,879 --> 00:12:55,960
When two fight

257
00:12:56,159 --> 00:12:57,080
The third profits

258
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,840
I wanted to see you brothers fight

259
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:00,080
Whoever gained the upper hand

260
00:13:00,159 --> 00:13:01,200
I would side with them

261
00:13:01,759 --> 00:13:03,440
So you think

262
00:13:04,039 --> 00:13:05,360
He gained the upper hand?

263
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:06,360
No

264
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,600
You are too vile

265
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,440
Though I am but a humble woman

266
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:13,879
I am also the daughter of a Minister, paid by the imperial court

267
00:13:14,559 --> 00:13:15,480
Having received the nation's grace

268
00:13:15,639 --> 00:13:16,440
Not thinking of repaying it

269
00:13:16,559 --> 00:13:17,240
But scheming for the enemy—

270
00:13:17,559 --> 00:13:18,919
This act of abandoning the nation in peril

271
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,039
Of treachery and betrayal

272
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,600
Is something I absolutely cannot do

273
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:23,639
What nonsense about nation!

274
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:27,879
If that bastard emperor hadn't passed the title to him

275
00:13:28,879 --> 00:13:30,799
Who knows who would be Marquis Weiyuan!

276
00:13:31,679 --> 00:13:33,159
We share the same father

277
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,159
Why are you the Marquis

278
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:37,080
While I'm just an ordinary noble?

279
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,080
Everything that belongs to me

280
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:41,879
Is snatched away by you!

281
00:13:43,399 --> 00:13:44,559
Fan Xingxu

282
00:13:45,919 --> 00:13:47,279
I won't lose
