1
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,680
Since the occasion is so lively,

2
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,160
our princess would also like to present a small gift,

3
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,800
as a token of respect.

4
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:47,080
Isn't this Doctor Jiang who serves Chu Beichi?

5
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,160
How dare she wear such fine clothes

6
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,720
and block the princess's path?

7
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:53,960
Doctor Jiang dares to offend the princess.

8
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,280
Let's see how Chu Beichi handles this.

9
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,160
Such audacity.

10
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,840
You rely on that useless Chu Beichi's protection

11
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,880
and still dare to stand before the princess.

12
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,360
Sir,

13
00:02:05,720 --> 00:02:07,920
please punish her and Chu Beichi for their crimes.

14
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,480
Sir, you and I serve in the same court.

15
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,600
Why did you strike my mother?

16
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:14,720
She blocked the princess's way.

17
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:16,920
And the princess hasn't appeared for a long time.

18
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,440
Could it be that she harmed the princess?

19
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,640
Nonsense!

20
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,480
This is our noble and honored Princess of Datian.

21
00:02:25,960 --> 00:02:28,200
Greetings, Your Highness the Princess.

22
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:31,680
Long live Your Highness!

23
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,080
You all—

24
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:42,040
You have three offenses.

25
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:45,480
First, you should not have bullied Young Master Chu.

26
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:50,000
Second, you should not have falsely accused a good person.

27
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:53,640
Third, you disrespected the royal family and did not kneel before me.

28
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,080
Spare us, Princess!

29
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,000
Siyan.

30
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,000
That was truly impressive.

31
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,160
The princess has a brilliant plan.

32
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:16,080
She even hid her identity to care for him for three years.

33
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,320
My information couldn't be wrong.

34
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,360
What's going on?

35
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,520
You tricked us!

36
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,720
Your information wasn't wrong either.

37
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:36,480
I didn't deliberately hide anything.

38
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:39,680
It's just that I studied medicine outside the palace since childhood.

39
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:41,760
Three years ago,

40
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:44,560
I learned that Young Master Chu was gravely ill.

41
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,560
So I volunteered to stay at the Chu residence for three years.

42
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,600
Young Master Chu

43
00:03:58,920 --> 00:04:00,320
You just said you would marry me.

44
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,640
Did you mean it?

45
00:04:09,080 --> 00:04:10,320
For the past three years,

46
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,920
I have been seriously injured and bedridden.

47
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:16,920
You have stayed by my side and cared for me without leaving.

48
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,280
If not for your attentive care,

49
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,640
I would have died long ago.

50
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:24,800
If you are willing,

51
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,800
I want to spend the rest of my life with you.

52
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,480
I am willing.

53
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,200
Of course I am willing.

54
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:38,160
I have been alone since childhood.

55
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:40,400
Because of you,

56
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,280
I have prayed every day for the past three years that you would wake up.

57
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,840
You are my only hope.

58
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,960
I have always considered you as family.

59
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,360
Feixue understands.

60
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,400
Today's offense was Feixue's fault.

61
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,040
Young master,

62
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:51,960
if you can find your own happiness,

63
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,040
I am very happy.

64
00:06:07,040 --> 00:06:08,360
Chu Beichi,

65
00:06:09,160 --> 00:06:11,200
I will have you in the end.

66
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,000
I won't leave you any way out again.

67
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:25,680
I never imagined

68
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:29,000
my son Beichi is not only a member of the Xuanjia Army,

69
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,840
but also chosen by the princess.

70
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,600
He even refused the Empress's favor.

71
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,000
This is truly the hope of our Chu family.

72
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:39,680
Beichi,

73
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,200
The young prince has arrived.

74
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:49,400
What a brilliant and exquisite show this is.

75
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,760
Who would have thought that our Datian's eldest princess, after so many years of silence,

76
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:58,200
would propose marriage to a good-for-nothing.

77
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:06,080
She doesn't even care about our royal family's reputation.

78
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,160
This marriage was arranged by my father, the emperor.

79
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:12,360
Are you questioning my father, the emperor, by saying this, heir apparent?

80
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:13,680
Liuli.

81
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:28,080
Si Yan

82
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,000
Are you really going to personally take care of the Kunlun General?

83
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,960
Yes.

84
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,600
As the noble eldest princess,

85
00:07:38,360 --> 00:07:40,480
you should be living in luxury.

86
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:44,640
Why put yourself through such hardship?

87
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,280
Why endure such grievances?

88
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,760
Within the palace walls,

89
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:50,760
one cannot hear the people's suffering.

90
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,920
Nor see the injustices of the world.

91
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:57,040
But the world's hardships won't disappear because of that.

92
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,040
As a woman, I cannot share my father's burdens.

93
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,000
But the Kunlun General has protected the nation for years.

94
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,960
And was injured for the sake of the people.

95
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,480
He

96
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:12,120
is worth saving.

97
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,040
Since that's the case,

98
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:18,400
I won't stop you anymore.

99
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:20,400
But when he wakes up,

100
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,200
you must announce my decree of marriage to him.

101
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:30,440
Thank you, Father.

102
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:43,080
Chu Beichi

103
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:45,160
Why?

104
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,400
By the way,

105
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,520
why hasn't today's gun bestowal ceremony started yet?

106
00:08:56,840 --> 00:09:00,120
The Kunlun General still hasn't appeared.

107
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:03,240
Did I come here today for nothing?

108
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:07,760
Report!

109
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,320
The Kunlun General is busy with affairs in the northern border.

110
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,840
The gun bestowal ceremony will not be held.

111
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,400
So, in that case,

112
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,480
General Chu Fengyu has become a laughingstock.

113
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,680
Could it be that the title of Kunlun Divine General's successor

114
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:31,040
is all fake?

115
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:32,160
Fake.

116
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:33,360
I really didn't expect this.

117
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,400
Turns out it was all a sham.

118
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,600
So we were all deceived by him.

119
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,480
Chu Beichi,

120
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,720
you're just a coward hiding behind women.

121
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:45,800
The gun bestowal ceremony is postponed.

122
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:48,800
But there's another matter that can't be postponed.

123
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:51,560
Chu Fengyu has repeatedly disrespected me.

124
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,720
Today, in front of everyone,

125
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,280
he shall be exiled.

126
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,280
And these two officials as well.

127
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,560
Exile them together.

128
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,000
Your Highness, please forgive us.

129
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:06,240
We beg the Princess for mercy.

130
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:07,520
Fengyu doesn't deserve such punishment.

131
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:08,840
It's all my fault alone.

132
00:10:08,840 --> 00:10:10,120
Don't hurt my mother!

133
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:12,400
Beichi,

134
00:10:12,840 --> 00:10:14,800
Fengyu is your own brother.

135
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:15,760
I'm begging you,

136
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:17,880
please ask the Princess to spare him.

137
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:22,000
As for Lady Chu,

138
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:25,400
forget it.

139
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:29,440
For the sake of Young Master Chu,

140
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:31,320
let her go for now.

141
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,640
Thank you, Princess.

142
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:36,640
Since everything is settled,

143
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:40,560
why don't we get married tomorrow?

144
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:43,880
Tomorrow?
