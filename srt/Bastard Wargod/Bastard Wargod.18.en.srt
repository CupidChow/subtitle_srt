1
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,000
The Kunlun General has been captured by Chu Beichi.

2
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:02,680
Oh my god.

3
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:03,920
He did it in just one move.

4
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,320
It's actually true.

5
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,520
Zhao Wudi.

6
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:15,080
Chu Beichi.

7
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:16,840
The young prince is a member of the royal family.

8
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,720
How dare you!

9
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:19,040
Guards!

10
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,160
Zhao Wudi.

11
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,200
The Kunlun General was actually an impostor.

12
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,680
It was Young Master Chu who caught him.

13
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:31,360
I can't believe he has such skills.

14
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:33,880
He's just a useless illegitimate son.

15
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:35,640
How dare he be so arrogant?

16
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:39,880
The ones approaching are rebels!

17
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,160
Follow my orders!

18
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,400
Execute them on the spot!

19
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:43,640
General.

20
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,200
Your brother is still outside the city.

21
00:01:46,520 --> 00:01:47,880
Heaven is helping me.

22
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,520
As long as we shoot them all down,

23
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,320
the military merit will be ours.

24
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:54,920
Fire the arrows!

25
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,120
Don't let a single one escape!

26
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:56,760
Yes!

27
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:44,560
Chu Beichi

28
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:46,400
Die here and now.

29
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:48,480
The humiliation I suffered in the past

30
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,560
I will return it all to you today.

31
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:52,080
Don't kill me.

32
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,560
I serve the King of Qi.

33
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,120
Stop!

34
00:02:56,520 --> 00:02:57,160
Feng Yu

35
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:58,840
Don't make an even bigger mistake.

36
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,320
Now you beg me?

37
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:01,360
It's too late.

38
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,160
Only by killing you

39
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:04,920
can I finally be seen by everyone.

40
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:07,680
All the glory you possess

41
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,120
should have belonged to me.

42
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:21,080
After him!

43
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,840
Yes!

44
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,560
Chu Beichi

45
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,320
We were born of the same root.

46
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,440
Why must we harm each other so urgently?

47
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,320
Do you really want me dead that badly?

48
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,200
Hand him over to me.

49
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,320
Do you know he was acting under the orders of King Qi?

50
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:06,400
King Qi

51
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,160
So what if he was?

52
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,680
Capturing the rebel leader before His Majesty

53
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,520
would be a remarkable achievement.

54
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,000
How could I let that slip by?

55
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:16,520
So,

56
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,240
you ordered your men to shoot arrows at me

57
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:21,160
and chased me all the way here.

58
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,800
Whether I kill you or not

59
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,400
has nothing to do with merit.

60
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,440
Then let's see if you have what it takes.

61
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,760
I might not be able to do it alone.

62
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,520
But I brought soldiers with me.

63
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,760
And you are all alone.

64
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,760
Do you think I wasted all these words with you for nothing?

65
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:42,240
Men!

66
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,600
Follow me to execute the rebel leader!

67
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
There will be great rewards!

68
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:53,720
Chu Beichi

69
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,760
Are you really not afraid of death?

70
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,440
Men!

71
00:04:57,920 --> 00:04:58,720
Stop shouting.

72
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,520
Shen Feixue

73
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,440
Why is it you?

74
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,840
Weren't you dead?

75
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,920
You again.

76
00:05:21,320 --> 00:05:23,640
You still don't understand the situation even now.

77
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,120
What a waste of those two eyes.

78
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:29,720
Commander Chu.

79
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:32,040
After Feixue received your carrier pigeon message,

80
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:32,960
she traveled day and night.

81
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,720
At last, in the name of the Kunlun Divine General,

82
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:36,880
she managed to stop all the armies coming here.

83
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:39,280
Feixue.

84
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,480
Thank you for your hard work.

85
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:41,960
Commander Chu, you flatter me.

86
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:43,960
Feixue only did what she was supposed to do.

87
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:45,880
What did you call him?

88
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,960
What did you call him?

89
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,880
So you finally know.

90
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,920
The Kunlun Divine General who supported the Chu family and helped Chu Fengyu,

91
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,200
is the very person you despised

92
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:57,960
and even wanted to get rid of as soon as possible—your elder brother.

93
00:05:57,960 --> 00:05:58,920
Chu Beichi.

94
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:02,080
How is this possible?

95
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,120
No way.

96
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:07,080
How could you be—

97
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:14,440
At this point,

98
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,440
you still refuse to accept the truth.

99
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,600
Admit your mistakes and repent to your elder brother.

100
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,080
No wonder

101
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,680
No wonder

102
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,720
No wonder I can never measure up to you.

103
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,040
Even Her Highness the Princess was willing to hide her identity

104
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,920
and take care of you for three whole years.

105
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:36,360
So you are the Kunlun Divine General.

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,120
Feng Yu,

107
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,400
I have never lied to you.

108
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:44,400
You have always seen me as a thorn in your side.

109
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,080
There were several times you could have discovered my identity,

110
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:51,120
but because of your prejudice and hatred,

111
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,520
you kept overlooking it.

112
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:55,240
Chu Beichi,

113
00:06:55,720 --> 00:06:57,560
Kunlun Divine General.

114
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,720
Fate truly plays tricks on people.

115
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,320
You are the Kunlun Divine General,

116
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,400
and you made great contributions in quelling the rebellion.

117
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,160
Next,

118
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:15,160
are you going to take revenge on me and the Chu family?

119
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:18,840
I have nothing to avenge.

120
00:07:19,720 --> 00:07:20,520
Because

121
00:07:21,600 --> 00:07:22,640
I don't need to.

122
00:07:24,640 --> 00:07:26,600
You truly are the Kunlun Divine General.

123
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:28,680
Such arrogance.

124
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,440
What if I told you

125
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,880
your birth mother died because of me?

126
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:40,000
Would you still be so magnanimous?

127
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,400
When did the master take in another concubine and illegitimate child outside?

128
00:07:47,720 --> 00:07:49,040
And now he wants to bring them back to raise.

129
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:51,040
This is absolutely infuriating!

130
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:53,000
Sister,

131
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:55,040
Your husband is, after all, an official at court.

132
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:58,120
Having an illegitimate child and bringing a concubine into the house,

133
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:01,680
If word gets out, it could have a bad impact.

134
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,840
It would also be disadvantageous for you as the mistress of the house.

135
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,720
Then what should I do?

136
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,200
I can't just stand by and watch

137
00:08:08,640 --> 00:08:10,200
and let them enter the household.

138
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,560
Mother,

139
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,080
Feng Yu,

140
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,000
If you had an older brother and a second mother,

141
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,760
and now both of them, one grown and one young, have nothing to eat,

142
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:23,440
tell me,

143
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,360
how could you make your mother happy?

144
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:32,360
Let the older one die.

145
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,640
Bring the younger one in to serve me.

146
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:43,280
What,

147
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:45,840
you still don't want revenge?

148
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:50,760
I heard your mother was left with nothing but bones in the end.

149
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,200
Her flesh was all eaten by wild dogs.

150
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,560
Come on,

151
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:00,880
kill me,

152
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:03,320
and avenge your wretched mother.

153
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,840
Mother!

154
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:17,800
What the Chu family owed us

155
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:20,040
has been repaid today.

156
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:32,960
Your Highness

157
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:37,880
The instigator of the rebellion is here.

158
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:42,160
This man is Zhao Wudi, Deputy General of the Qi Prince's residence.

159
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:45,160
He colluded with those impersonating the Xuanjia Army.

160
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,800
They intended to rebel.

161
00:09:47,800 --> 00:09:48,560
Behind this

162
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:51,160
there must be someone pulling the strings.

163
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:52,400
Chu Beichi

164
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,720
Even if you managed to capture the ringleader by luck,

165
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,880
you still held His Majesty hostage.

166
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:00,760
That crime is unforgivable.

167
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,680
Besides, His Majesty's fate is currently unknown.

168
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:06,200
Who knows if he has already fallen victim to your treachery?

169
00:10:06,520 --> 00:10:09,000
Don't think you can use this to get away with it.

170
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,040
Are you saying

171
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:13,720
His Majesty is already dead?
