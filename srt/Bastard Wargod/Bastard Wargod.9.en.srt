1
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,720
Go.

2
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,200
Don't move.

3
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,200
Young Prince.

4
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,640
Based on the clues we have,

5
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,200
this person appears to be the younger brother of a Xuanjia Army soldier.

6
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,840
It seems so.

7
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:19,760
This...

8
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:22,480
My elder brother risked his life for Datian.

9
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:24,800
You accused him of desertion without even investigating the truth.

10
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,720
You even harmed his family.

11
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,600
What is your intention?

12
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:28,560
I will report this to the court.

13
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:29,320
I will seek justice.

14
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,000
You...

15
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:42,720
Causing such a misunderstanding really shouldn't have happened.

16
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:45,960
How about I personally apologize to you?

17
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:46,920
However,

18
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,200
I hate it when people look at me like that.

19
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,800
My eyes...

20
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:16,000
Young Prince.

21
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:17,520
How should we deal with this person?

22
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,040
Since he is a deserter's family member,

23
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:29,200
we should act on behalf of justice.

24
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:31,240
Execute him immediately.

25
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,520
What about his family?

26
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:46,200
Better to let them live.

27
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:48,560
You will support them.

28
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,440
The crime of desertion

29
00:02:57,320 --> 00:02:58,720
is punishable by death according to the law.

30
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,040
Detain them and await trial.

31
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,640
Yes.

32
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:05,320
Move, get up.

33
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,760
Move.

34
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:07,160
Get up.

35
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,960
The Xuanjia Army of the Kunlun Divine General has always been a threat to Father King's great cause.

36
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,280
The current plan is to kill the soldiers' families and fabricate a wrongful case.

37
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,480
This will lure the Xuanjia Army into rebellion.

38
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,280
Once they rebel,

39
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:23,480
Datian will surely fall into chaos.

40
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,240
Additionally,

41
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,840
Summon Chu Fengyu for questioning.

42
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:32,000
Since he is the successor of the Kunlun Divine General,

43
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,160
he is the most suitable person for this task.

44
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,720
No one could be more suitable.

45
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,240
Yes.

46
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:02,080
Commander Chu

47
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,160
A scout has reported in.

48
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,120
Last night, a village was suddenly engulfed in flames.

49
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,560
None of the villagers survived.

50
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,040
The surrounding people all say

51
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,600
that there were deserters from the Xuanjia Army.

52
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,600
The families of the deserters were harshly punished by the court.

53
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,480
The entire village was implicated.

54
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,040
The Xuanjia Army has never had deserters.

55
00:04:18,640 --> 00:04:19,960
This must be the Crown Prince's scheme.

56
00:04:20,240 --> 00:04:22,000
You personally founded the Xuanjia Army.

57
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:23,840
It is the backbone of the Northern Army.

58
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,840
It has achieved great military merit for our Datian.

59
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:27,840
Now it is being slandered as harboring deserters.

60
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,640
There must be a bigger plot behind this.

61
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,480
Eradicating deserters is probably just a pretext.

62
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,720
In reality, it's to frame and harm the loyal and good.

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,120
This is to force the Xuanjia Army into rebellion.

64
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,200
Jiang Wuyou isn't clever enough for this.

65
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,120
The one who wants to rebel is likely his father, Prince Qi.

66
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,040
Soldiers

67
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:56,640
are the sharpest weapon of the nation.

68
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,160
Destroying the army's morale

69
00:04:58,160 --> 00:04:59,560
is more despicable than losing elite troops.

70
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:01,680
Feixue

71
00:05:02,120 --> 00:05:03,720
Return to the Northern Border at once and calm the troops.

72
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,280
As for the other matters,

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:08,400
leave them to me.

74
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:10,200
Feixue accepts the order.

75
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,920
I heard the young prince has taken action against the Xuanjia Army.

76
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,360
If the Xuanjia Army's morale falters,

77
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:34,680
even the Divine General of Kunlun won't be able to turn things around.

78
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,600
If Beilie sends troops,

79
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:39,560
Father's great cause will surely succeed.

80
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:41,840
Help you?

81
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:44,680
What benefit is there for me?

82
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,000
We can open markets and trade.

83
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:51,960
When the time comes, however many border towns Your Majesty desires,

84
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:54,560
my Datian will give you that many.

85
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,640
No.

86
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:00,000
I only want one person.

87
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:05,240
Chu Beichi.

88
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:09,480
That's not difficult.

89
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:13,040
He's just a minor official's illegitimate son.

90
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:16,400
But Your Majesty's reminder

91
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:18,240
just made me remember—

92
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:21,680
he seems to be one of the deserters.

93
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,960
If you want to go after him,

94
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:32,640
this deal is off.

95
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,040
Because I

96
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,120
have already foreseen your fate.

97
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,040
The Kunlun General is your mentor.

98
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,320
Replying to you, Your Highness,

99
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:06,080
Yes, that's correct.

100
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,400
You have achieved many military merits,

101
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,040
but he didn't show up at your knighting ceremony.

102
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,560
He even let you become a prisoner.

103
00:07:15,960 --> 00:07:17,800
There was not a trace of teacher-student affection.

104
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:21,040
How can you call him your mentor?

105
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,440
Your elder brother always overshadows you.

106
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:27,880
Could it be

107
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,760
that you don't hate them?

108
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:31,160
I do hate them.

109
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:33,040
I hate them.

110
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:38,400
If you are willing to serve me in the future,

111
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,240
and help me eliminate the Xuanjia Army and the Kunlun General,

112
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,200
one day, you will be second only to me.

113
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:44,760
Are you willing?

114
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:48,120
As long as I can surpass Chu Beichi,

115
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:49,720
I'll do anything you ask.

116
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,640
Good.

117
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:01,960
Since you are willing to be my dog,

118
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,320
how can you not bear some marks on your body?

119
00:08:12,320 --> 00:08:13,880
Please go ahead, Your Highness.

120
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:46,360
Alright.

121
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,120
All this walking has made me dizzy.

122
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,440
Master.

123
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:53,280
No matter what, we must rescue Feng Yu.

124
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:55,800
He is your own son.

125
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,320
But isn't Beichi also my own son?

126
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,000
You only have yourselves to blame for disrespecting the princess back then.

127
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:03,120
Things have come to this point.

128
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,040
It's too late to say anything now.

129
00:09:05,720 --> 00:09:08,240
Chu Beichi, Chu Beichi...

130
00:09:09,080 --> 00:09:12,080
All you care about is the Chu family's reputation.

131
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,800
You stubborn old man.

132
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,320
No.

133
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,360
There's still room to turn things around.

134
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,720
Feng Yu.

135
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,560
Feng Yu.

136
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,560
You're back.

137
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:30,840
My son, you've suffered.

138
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:34,720
It's all because Chu Beichi is so ruthless.

139
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,400
How will my son get by from now on?

140
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:40,680
Mother.

141
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:41,760
Don't worry.

142
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,600
I've received the decree from Prince Qi.

143
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:46,760
He also promised to entrust me with important responsibilities in the future.

144
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,360
That's my son.

145
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:51,480
To be valued by the court.

146
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,680
You will surely rise to great heights in the future.

147
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:55,240
Good.

148
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,080
Very good.

149
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,080
This is a heaven-sent opportunity.

150
00:09:58,200 --> 00:09:59,840
You must not slack off.

151
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:00,880
Father.

152
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:02,160
Mother.

153
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:03,840
No need to worry.

154
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:06,080
I will surely bring honor to the Chu family.

155
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,000
I want everyone to know

156
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:09,600
who is truly the pride of the Chu family.

157
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,160
Chu Beichi ruined my reputation.

158
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,240
He stole my honors.

159
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,280
I will make him pay the price.

160
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,160
Go.
