1
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:03,880
Chu Beichi was moving around aimlessly from the start, with no apparent strategy.

2
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:04,440
This...

3
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,880
How did he start gaining the upper hand?

4
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,880
So he had a plan all along.

5
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:17,720
A bunch of fools.

6
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,360
Everything is under Chu Beichi's control.

7
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:22,840
Young Master.

8
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,680
Chu Beichi is skilled in strategy.

9
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:27,440
It seems these people...

10
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:30,480
probably won't be able to kill anyone today.

11
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:32,200
Your Majesty.

12
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,680
Isn't it too soon to say that?

13
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,160
I still have a trump card.

14
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:51,920
Beichi.

15
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,760
The incense is almost burned out.

16
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:11,440
It's already a deadlock.

17
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,160
It seems...

18
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,240
you still won.

19
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,800
Since that's the case...

20
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,240
Chu Beichi, just finish this game already.

21
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,960
If you don't act soon,

22
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,840
the incense will burn out.

23
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:38,560
Feixue.

24
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,160
Feixue.

25
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,560
Why is it her?

26
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:43,200
General Shen.

27
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,320
Why is Shen Feixue here?

28
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:51,600
Help!

29
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,680
Save me!

30
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,880
My husband is not a deserter.

31
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,360
My husband is a martyr of the Xuanjia Army.

32
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:00,840
I'll take you away.

33
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:02,000
Help me.

34
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,000
A sedative from the Southern Border.

35
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,640
The drug is indeed potent.

36
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:20,320
Of course.

37
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,560
Jiang Wuyou

38
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,720
The outcome has been decided.

39
00:03:29,720 --> 00:03:30,840
Why won't you let her go?

40
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:34,560
As long as neither side has fallen,

41
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:36,640
the game isn't over.

42
00:03:37,520 --> 00:03:39,200
Isn't that right, Your Majesty?

43
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:43,760
She was poisoned by a drug from the Southern Border.

44
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:45,320
It can seize the soul and spirit.

45
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,000
She can't be awakened anymore.

46
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:49,280
Once it marks you as an enemy,

47
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,040
it won't stop until one of you dies.

48
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,080
It will pursue you until you are dead.

49
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,120
There's no time left.

50
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:10,760
Alright.

51
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:12,720
Okay.

52
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:13,960
That's great!

53
00:04:15,160 --> 00:04:15,880
Feixue

54
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,880
Feixue

55
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:25,040
Commander Chu

56
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,320
What did I do?

57
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:31,520
Where am I?

58
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:34,240
What have I done?

59
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:39,720
Feixue

60
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,640
Feixue

61
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:45,080
Feixue

62
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:48,560
I thought that if I hid my identity,

63
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:49,680
laid down my armor and returned home,

64
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:53,000
there would be no more wars within the four borders.

65
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:55,920
You and the Xuanjia Army would also be safe.

66
00:04:57,400 --> 00:04:58,040
But...

67
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,880
I was wrong.

68
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:04,840
Feixue

69
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:09,480
From today on, you are the greatest female general in the land.

70
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,360
From now on, you must protect the borders and bring peace to the people.

71
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:15,120
Defend the nation and keep it safe.

72
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:29,440
Thank you, Commander Chu.

73
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:36,120
You have fought alongside me for many years.

74
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Everyone calls you the greatest female general in the world.

75
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,000
But only I know

76
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:47,240
that if it weren't for protecting your home and country,

77
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,400
You're just a little girl too.

78
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:51,760
Young master,

79
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,640
It was Feixue who arrived too late.

80
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,120
I caused you to suffer such injustice.

81
00:05:57,240 --> 00:05:58,160
You are not yet married,

82
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,240
and I am not yet wed.

83
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,920
Feixue dares to ask you once more,

84
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,840
would you be willing to marry me?

85
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:07,560
Feixue...

86
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:10,640
I wanted to protect you for a lifetime,

87
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,560
but I never thought you would suffer such a fate because of me.

88
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:18,160
It's my fault.

89
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:23,400
I failed to protect the Xuanjia Army, and I failed to protect you.

90
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:25,800
Feixue...

91
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,840
Today, I will use the blood of villains

92
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:32,680
to honor your heroic spirit.

93
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,320
Chu Beichi,

94
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,120
I never expected things to end like this.

95
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,160
You...

96
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,560
Get back to Beilie!

97
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,160
Master...

98
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,320
I just...

99
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,520
Although I didn't manage to kill the whole family,

100
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,400
at least Shen Feixue is dead.

101
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,160
That's still a gain.

102
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,680
Jiang Wuyou!

103
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:23,680
How can you be so vicious?

104
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,440
You harm the loyal and good,

105
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,800
and bring disaster to the people.

106
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,160
Princess, you exaggerate.

107
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:35,680
Are you really not afraid of my father punishing you at all?

108
00:07:36,040 --> 00:07:36,960
Punish me?

109
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:39,080
I am a royal prince,

110
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:40,880
and the heir of King Qi.

111
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,880
Not only do you lack the authority,

112
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,800
even the emperor would have to think twice.

113
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:48,960
No one in this world can punish me.

114
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:49,640
You...

115
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:01,640
Beichi

116
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:02,960
He is a member of the royal family.

117
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,480
Are you sure about this?

118
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:07,800
Chu Beichi

119
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,040
How dare you touch me!

120
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,760
Confess your crimes at once!

121
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,800
Explain how you framed the Xuanjia Army.

122
00:08:14,040 --> 00:08:15,440
And harmed the loyal and good.

123
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,320
Chu Beichi

124
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:18,280
The young prince is of royal blood.

125
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:19,120
How dare you!

126
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:20,080
Chu Beichi

127
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:21,960
You dare plot against the royal family?

128
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:24,560
Are you trying to implicate the Chu family with your actions?

129
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,080
Release the young prince immediately!

130
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,560
Or I will not spare you!

131
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:28,960
Useless fool!

132
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:30,840
Hurry and get my father to save me!

133
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,600
You've always looked down on others.

134
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,520
I suppose

135
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:44,320
you've never experienced something like this before.

136
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,800
No, no!

137
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:50,680
No!

138
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,840
No!

139
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:57,920
Will you talk or not?

140
00:08:59,000 --> 00:08:59,800
I'll talk!

141
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,920
I'll talk!

142
00:09:02,120 --> 00:09:04,840
I framed the loyal men, accused them of desertion.

143
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,000
I harmed their families.

144
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:08,640
I caused General Shen Feixue's death.

145
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,600
I treated human life as worthless.

146
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:10,640
I was extremely vicious.

147
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,240
I...

148
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:15,800
I've confessed everything.

149
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:17,240
Aren't you going to let me go now?

150
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,080
Do you want your entire clan wiped out?

151
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:22,520
Feixue

152
00:09:23,520 --> 00:09:24,600
Brothers,

153
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,320
Today, I will use his life

154
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:29,920
to atone to all of you.

155
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,400
Your Highness

156
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:54,200
Prince

157
00:09:54,680 --> 00:09:55,640
Something terrible has happened.

158
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:59,040
The heir was killed in public by Chu Beichi.

159
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,080
What did you say?

160
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:05,680
Chu Beichi

161
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,920
How dare he kill my beloved son!

162
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:12,960
I will have him torn to pieces!

163
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:14,600
Prince

164
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:17,920
But Chu Beichi has already turned himself in.

165
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:19,680
He willingly went to prison.

166
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,480
Killing a royal

167
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:28,000
was done by me alone.

168
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,840
It has nothing to do with anyone else.
