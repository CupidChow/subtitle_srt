1
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,440
King Qi secretly summoned nine generals to the palace.

2
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,720
The situation is critical.

3
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:02,760
When will the Kunlun Divine General wake up?

4
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:09,680
He has been taking medicine for three years because of the Blood Bandit's poison.

5
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,440
His internal organs have long been damaged.

6
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:13,160
Now,

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:15,720
he has also been poisoned by King Qi's deadly toxin.

8
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,880
I can only suppress it temporarily with medicine.

9
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,160
Is it really that serious?

10
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,480
Did you truly do your best?

11
00:01:27,760 --> 00:01:30,120
Her Highness the Princess and the young master share a deep bond.

12
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,880
It's not your place as an outsider to comment.

13
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:37,160
Even the Kunlun Divine General is on the brink of death.

14
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:41,280
Naturally, I should leave this place of trouble as soon as possible.

15
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,000
How is he?

16
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,040
He's fine.

17
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,880
Life and death are determined by fate.

18
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,080
This disaster was destined.

19
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
You are the Kunlun Divine General.

20
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:19,720
How can you just accept your fate?

21
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:21,920
Besides, you promised me

22
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,520
that you would always stay by my side.

23
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:26,440
I will keep my promise.

24
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,600
Since the decision has been made,

25
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:30,960
we should act immediately.

26
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,120
We can't give King Qi any more opportunities.

27
00:02:35,880 --> 00:02:37,200
I'm worried about you.

28
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,440
Don't worry.

29
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,800
Father Emperor,

30
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:54,720
this is Chu Beichi, the Kunlun Divine General.

31
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,240
He retrieved this from King Qi's residence.

32
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,400
It's evidence of King Qi coercing the ministers.

33
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,280
There is no time to lose.

34
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,080
I ask Father Emperor to issue an imperial decree.

35
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:21,240
Prepare the ink.

36
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,520
I am going to draft an edict.

37
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,560
Siyan,

38
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,680
you have grown up.

39
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:32,400
There is something I have kept secret for many years.

40
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:35,040
Today, I will tell you everything.

41
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,000
It concerns the origins of you and another person.

42
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,600
Oh, royal brother, royal brother.

43
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,840
You would rather hand over the throne

44
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,680
to a little girl who isn't even your own flesh and blood

45
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,960
than give it to me.

46
00:04:16,760 --> 00:04:20,840
Then don't blame me for turning against my own family.

47
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,360
After all,

48
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,400
I am the true heir of the Jiang family.

49
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,160
Tomorrow,

50
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,160
the Emperor will summon Chu Beichi to the palace.

51
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,400
We will use this opportunity

52
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:36,320
to present a grand gift to this father and son who have been separated for years.

53
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,840
to present a grand gift.

54
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:40,840
My lord, all the tribes of the grasslands

55
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,920
as well as the remnants of the Donghu army and the Beilie troops are ready.

56
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,640
We are only waiting for the uprising in the capital.

57
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,920
Then we can mobilize our forces to besiege the northern border.

58
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,880
The Kunlun General is currently in the capital.

59
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,480
Shen Feixue is traveling around to clear the names of deserters.

60
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,680
My only real concern, the Northern Army, is now leaderless.

61
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,840
Defeating them will be a piece of cake.

62
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,800
Go inform Liu Wuzhou and the other imperial guards' commanders in the capital.

63
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:10,920
Tomorrow night,

64
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,840
if Jiang Siyan tries to mobilize troops,

65
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:15,280
kill him on the spot.

66
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,960
Once the palace is set on fire,

67
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,400
immediately suppress all reinforcements and resisters outside the palace.

68
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:26,320
Take control of the capital.

69
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,920
Yes, sir.

70
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:31,640
As long as Chu Beichi and Jiang Siyan are dead,

71
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,640
the throne will be yours, my lord.

72
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:35,680
My lord, your strategy is truly brilliant.

73
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,680
But even though the Kunlun General is gravely poisoned,

74
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,200
he is not to be underestimated.

75
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,040
Leave Chu Beichi to me.

76
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:14,840
Chu Beichi

77
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,360
Am I not even worthy of fighting you in a fair battle?

78
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,000
Fair and honorable

79
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:24,400
You became the King of Qi's lackey for the sake of power.

80
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:27,280
You risked the crime of treason for fame and fortune.

81
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,080
Is this what you call fair and honorable in your heart?

82
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:34,600
Your blood is not worthy of staining the soul of this loyal spear.

83
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:39,680
You know what you must do.

84
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,440
Chu Beichi is cunning by nature.

85
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,600
I have a foolproof plan to capture him.

86
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:16,600
It will ensure nothing goes wrong.

87
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,560
Does Your Highness truly intend to rebel?

88
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:24,640
Although it is now too late for regrets,

89
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,520
I have no other choice.

90
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:29,600
Lord Liu

91
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:37,920
Your Highness

92
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,040
You came here just yesterday.

93
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,640
What brings you here again today?

94
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:43,720
I have always remembered

95
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
that it was Lord Liu who saved me from the blade when I was a child.

96
00:07:49,640 --> 00:07:53,000
And now you would turn your blade against me?

97
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:57,120
Will you be a traitor to the current dynasty or a hero of the new one?

98
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,560
Decide for yourself.

99
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,240
Chu Beichi

100
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:41,280
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

101
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,000
Your Highness

102
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:46,800
You have finally revealed your true colors.

103
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:50,240
Today, I will eliminate you.

104
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,640
Then I will become the supreme ruler.

105
00:08:54,520 --> 00:08:57,680
It seems you still haven't given up.

106
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:01,680
Destiny is in my hands.

107
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:03,880
Your time is up.

108
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,680
Why should I give up?

109
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:30,800
After all I've done to you,

110
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,280
you still spared my life.

111
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,320
Chu Beichi

112
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:36,840
No

113
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,400
Brother

114
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:40,680
Was I really wrong?

115
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,120
As soon as Chu Beichi arrives tomorrow night,

116
00:09:43,960 --> 00:09:45,640
I will close the military gates.

117
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,160
At that time,

118
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,360
he will be alone and exhausted.

119
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:55,120
I will make sure he dies with no place to be buried.

120
00:09:58,520 --> 00:09:59,320
Good

121
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,920
The time, place, and people are all in our favor.

122
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,800
Everything is within my grasp.

123
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,640
Our great cause will surely succeed.

124
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,000
Long live the new emperor, may you reign for ten thousand years!

125
00:10:13,840 --> 00:10:15,120
Brother

126
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:16,320
This time,

127
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,840
let me protect you.

128
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,560
Your Highness

129
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,480
I, Chu Fengyu, am loyal only to the Datian kingdom.

130
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:47,600
My brother once taught me

131
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,800
to be loyal to the ruler, love the country, and protect the people.

132
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,280
How could I join King Qi

133
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:54,240
and you traitors

134
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,360
in your evil deeds?

135
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
King Qi is dead.

136
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,800
Why haven't you surrendered yet?

137
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,760
Be careful!

138
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:15,440
Fengyu!

139
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:17,920
Feng Yu

140
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:21,320
Elder brother

141
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,320
Feng Yu has been blinded by the pursuit of fame and fortune all his life.

142
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,960
It was you who helped me rediscover myself.

143
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:30,960
The essence of being a general

144
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:32,320
is to distinguish right from wrong.

145
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:33,480
To protect the common people.

146
00:11:34,080 --> 00:11:36,080
If one only knows how to fight and kill,

147
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:38,600
they will become nothing more than a tool for killing.

148
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,880
To win without killing

149
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,640
is to bring peace to the world.

150
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:43,680
Chu Feng Yu

151
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:46,040
Commander Chu has risked his life countless times over the years.

152
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,040
Yet he has always cared about your Chu family.

153
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:50,360
He especially placed great hopes on you.

154
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,160
He often said that given time,

155
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,120
you would surely become a great general.

156
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:56,680
But your actions now

157
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:59,040
have truly disappointed him.

158
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:00,880
Even so,

159
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,000
he still did not kill you.

160
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,280
Because he believes

161
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,520
you were only momentarily blinded.

162
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:12,360
He hopes you will soon come to your senses.

163
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,680
Do not keep making the same mistakes.

164
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,520
Do not let down Commander Chu's expectations for you.

165
00:12:18,520 --> 00:12:19,600
His spear

166
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,680
will be passed on to you sooner or later.

167
00:12:25,560 --> 00:12:26,920
Feng Yu

168
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:32,280
Next time we meet, we will settle who wins and who loses.

169
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,480
Feng Yu

170
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:54,840
Feng Yu

171
00:12:57,400 --> 00:12:58,680
Chu Feng Yu

172
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,160
You useless fool

173
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,000
You really can't be relied on.

174
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:05,720
Your death would not be a loss.

175
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:07,000
Kill them.

176
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:07,640
Yes.
