1
00:01:04,240 --> 00:01:05,160
Elder brother.

2
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:08,240
In the end, you still can't defeat me.

3
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:10,480
Looks to me like you walked right into a trap.

4
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,120
Prince Qi.

5
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:19,840
How could you be here?

6
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:25,160
I only wanted to see you one last time.

7
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:28,560
I didn't expect to drag you into danger.

8
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:32,080
One last time?

9
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,120
I was planning to leave today.

10
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:38,560
And never set foot in the capital again.

11
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:41,440
Then today,

12
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:45,520
is both a reunion

13
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:47,520
and a farewell.

14
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,280
A farewell.

15
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:54,720
So your own son won't inherit the throne?

16
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,920
Even if I wished it,

17
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,120
he wouldn't accept it.

18
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:01,400
Impossible.

19
00:02:01,760 --> 00:02:04,680
Are there really people in this world who don't covet the throne?

20
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,720
Not everyone in this world is like you and me,

21
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,440
obsessed with this seat.

22
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:14,760
If that's the case, then the throne is mine.

23
00:02:15,320 --> 00:02:16,080
Keep dreaming.

24
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:18,560
The throne is meant for Siyian.

25
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,960
You can't take it.

26
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,880
You're insane.

27
00:02:27,960 --> 00:02:30,680
At first, I also had my doubts.

28
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:32,360
I was always unable to make a decision.

29
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:34,080
That's how I let a tiger become a threat.

30
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,680
Giving someone as ambitious as you an opportunity.

31
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:42,640
But Chu Beichi's words

32
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,960
suddenly enlightened me.

33
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,800
Even if you are not of my bloodline,

34
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,320
not a man,

35
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:50,800
what does it matter?

36
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,760
Absurd.

37
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,840
How could the Jiang family's empire be handed over so easily?

38
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:57,880
If the late emperor's spirit is watching from above,

39
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:00,320
and knew what you have done,

40
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:02,000
he would surely regret

41
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:03,200
passing the throne to you.

42
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,040
Father knew your true nature.

43
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,720
Even if I hadn't taken the throne back then,

44
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,400
he would rather let the empire fall into others' hands

45
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,120
than let you inherit it.

46
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:16,080
You're lying.

47
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,880
I am better than you in every way.

48
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,360
Father was just momentarily confused.

49
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,560
The way of a wise ruler

50
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,400
lies in winning people's hearts.

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:28,000
Even if you possess great strength,

52
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,040
even with thousands of troops,

53
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,200
how much of the empire can you truly hold?

54
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,400
No matter what,

55
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,880
this world belongs to me.

56
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,440
Chu Beichi,

57
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,000
open your eyes and see.

58
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,320
Other than this useless emperor,

59
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,680
you are now all alone.

60
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:54,920
What do you have to defeat me?

61
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,560
Who says he has no one behind him?

62
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,280
Jiang Siyan,

63
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,240
why are you here?

64
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:10,440
Did Liu Wuzhou fail?

65
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,000
The one who failed is you.

66
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,040
Imperial pardon token.

67
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,080
That's right.

68
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,360
Thanks to His Majesty's grace,

69
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,760
my father Liu Wuzhou was granted an imperial pardon token.

70
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:23,280
As long as he repents in time,

71
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:25,960
he will be allowed to atone for his mistakes and be forgiven.

72
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,200
Father,

73
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,760
Liu Wuzhou, receive the imperial decree.

74
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:37,800
You...

75
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:44,640
By the mandate of Heaven, the Emperor decrees:

76
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,520
Last night, I was enlightened by the late emperor in a dream.

77
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,360
I deeply regret having neglected state affairs in recent years.

78
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:51,560
I have grown distant from my officials.

79
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,000
Therefore, after deep reflection,

80
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,440
I have decided to grant a general amnesty.

81
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,360
And to bestow imperial pardon tokens upon loyal ministers and generals,

82
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,880
as a sign of my grace.

83
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,960
Father,

84
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:07,640
this is the first time our dynasty has granted imperial pardon tokens to officials.

85
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,160
No one is perfect.

86
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:11,360
Who can be without fault?

87
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:13,520
I believe in you, Father.

88
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:16,960
As long as you can serve with integrity from now on,

89
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,080
and once again serve the country and the people,

90
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:21,520
the court will still remember you.

91
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
Your loyal heart will not be let down.

92
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,400
Lord Liu,

93
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,520
I am still grateful for the life-saving favor you once granted me.

94
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,480
Your Majesty's great kindness and virtue

95
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,720
We will never forget for the rest of our lives

96
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,240
I swear to the heavens

97
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:05,840
From now on, I will never betray Your Majesty's grace and favor

98
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:07,920
Even if I must sacrifice my life

99
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,480
I will not stop until death

100
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,120
It's not just Liu Wuzhou

101
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:20,360
There are also other officials on your list

102
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,400
Except for those who are utterly stubborn

103
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:25,520
Father has granted them all immunity from death

104
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,400
They are now arresting rebels everywhere

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:34,520
And your Prince Qi's residence has already been completely taken by us

106
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,240
Elder brother, you truly spared no effort

107
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,200
So many officials

108
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,640
You wrote edicts all night long

109
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,560
Yes

110
00:06:55,880 --> 00:06:58,680
I am indeed inferior to you in many ways

111
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,920
But I can make up for my shortcomings with diligence

112
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,960
And I sincerely wish to repent

113
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,360
Do you?

114
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:17,080
Commander Chu

115
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,760
Prince Qi's personal guards have all been killed outside the military gate

116
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,120
Also, following Commander Chu's orders

117
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,280
Feixue has traveled everywhere

118
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:23,520
To clear the name of the Xuanjia Army

119
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,760
And has eliminated all their die-hard followers

120
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,360
Well done

121
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,280
Guards

122
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,960
Kill this foolish ruler first

123
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,200
You

124
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,560
You didn't expect this, did you?

125
00:07:48,200 --> 00:07:51,240
You treacherous dog

126
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,360
This time, we're truly even

127
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:09,120
Even now, you still refuse to surrender

128
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,600
Do you still want to follow this traitor?

129
00:08:18,320 --> 00:08:21,240
Uncle, you have no way out now

130
00:08:22,280 --> 00:08:23,400
So

131
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:27,440
This is what you meant that day

132
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:30,120
The plan you prepared to deal with me

133
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:34,200
This plan is truly flawless

134
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:40,880
Chu Beichi

135
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,320
You and Shen Feixue are not in the northern border.

136
00:08:44,840 --> 00:08:46,600
Foreign invaders took the opportunity to attack.

137
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,000
Datian will surely fall into chaos.

138
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,080
How could you be so ruthless?

139
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:52,640
Those are all my soldiers and people of Datian.

140
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:54,120
If I can't have it,

141
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,720
then no one else can.

142
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:03,800
Your Majesty,

143
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:05,920
The remnants of the Donghu army and the steppe coalition

144
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,000
have been wiped out by our Beilie army together with the Xuanjia army.

145
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,680
We have seized countless supplies and provisions.

146
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:12,800
Why not take this chance to attack Datian?

147
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:16,080
We only have one life.

148
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,480
But the wars never end.

149
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,120
Take all the spoils back to Beilie.

150
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:22,760
Yes.

151
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,640
Chu Beichi

152
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,320
This is the reward you give me.

153
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:36,560
But things between us will not end here.

154
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,280
I still haven't gotten you yet.

155
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,560
King Qi,

156
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,840
you have no other choice now.

157
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,600
Surrender while you still can.

158
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:47,120
I can still spare your life.

159
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,640
Though I have been defeated,

160
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,880
losing to the Divine General of Kunlun is not a bad thing.

161
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,840
At least,

162
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:59,160
you are deeply poisoned.

163
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,840
When we meet in the afterlife,

164
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,280
I’ll see how you manage to hold this world together.

165
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:32,760
Beichi, Commander Chu!

166
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,040
Commander Chu!

167
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,400
Young Master!

168
00:10:44,400 --> 00:10:45,160
Beichi, Commander Chu!

169
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,120
Please don't go.

170
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:08,920
Trust me.

171
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:09,880
I can do it.

172
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:12,120
I can heal you just like I did three years ago.

173
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,640
I am the Kunlun General.

174
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,400
I won't die.

175
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,000
It's just that the world has only recently been unified.

176
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:24,720
I still have other matters to take care of.

177
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:26,960
Then...

178
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:28,640
Where are you going?

179
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,600
I can go with you.

180
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,840
The people of Datian still need you.

181
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,400
Wait for me to come back.

182
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,000
I will definitely marry you.

183
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,920
Okay.

184
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,440
I'll wait for you.

185
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:54,720
Beichi.

186
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:16,840
Siyan.

187
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:19,560
Your ambition should be for all the people.

188
00:12:20,280 --> 00:12:21,960
You are destined to live for the common people.

189
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,440
But I...

190
00:12:30,280 --> 00:12:31,640
After the world is at peace,

191
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:34,280
I only want to live for one person.

192
00:12:36,640 --> 00:12:37,280
Hyah!

193
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:39,520
Hyah!

194
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,000
Hyah!

195
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:45,720
Chu Beichi!

196
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,600
You jerk!

197
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:07,280
Beichi

198
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,440
In the past, you fought bravely on the battlefield.

199
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:14,320
Yet all you wished for was to live as an ordinary person.

200
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,240
To become a mere speck of dust among the vast mountains and rivers.

201
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:21,760
And I,

202
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:24,760
turned my longing into ink,

203
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:27,240
and sent my feelings on red paper.

204
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:30,280
All I hoped for

205
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:33,320
was a wedding night with candlelight,

206
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:35,880
to live in harmony and respect with you,

207
00:13:37,240 --> 00:13:39,400
to sit with you and watch spring flowers and winter snow.

208
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,280
No longer troubled by worldly affairs,

209
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:44,480
unbound by fate,

210
00:13:45,080 --> 00:13:46,920
just to be an ordinary couple.

211
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,240
After many years,

212
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,520
holding a child in our arms,

213
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,040
softly saying,

214
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:58,560
"What night is this?"

215
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:00,800
To see such a beloved person.

216
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,760
I hope for your return,

217
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:08,440
but it seems so far away.

218
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:11,440
I don't know now

219
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:14,720
if we are separated by life

220
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,560
or by death.

221
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,880
Beichi

222
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,080
Siyan

223
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,160
I've come to marry you.
