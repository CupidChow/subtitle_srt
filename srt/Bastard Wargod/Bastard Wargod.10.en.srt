1
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,240
Bodhisattva, please bless us.

2
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,280
Please bless my son to return safely from the army.

3
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:03,800
Bodhisattva, please bless us.

4
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,840
Bodhisattva, please bless us.

5
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,880
Please bless my son to return safely from the army.

6
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,360
Bodhisattva, please bless us.

7
00:01:27,480 --> 00:01:28,240
Reporting to the general.

8
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,120
There is no one inside the house.

9
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:30,480
But the candle is still warm.

10
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,800
They must have just left.

11
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:35,320
Could someone be interfering?

12
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:39,440
Young master.

13
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,960
We have rescued the person.

14
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,680
But the princess went to the prison alone.

15
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,000
This is bad.

16
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:02,080
Be good.

17
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,120
It's okay.

18
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:23,120
The Grand Princess of Datian is here.

19
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,000
Release them at once!

20
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,040
Your Highness, the Princess.

21
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:27,640
This humble one...

22
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:30,200
I dare not disobey the young prince's orders.

23
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:31,560
If you still refuse to release them,

24
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:33,240
I will execute you on the spot.

25
00:02:33,320 --> 00:02:33,920
This...

26
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,000
Elder sister, what an imposing presence you have.

27
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:47,960
Step aside.

28
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,160
You have fabricated false charges.

29
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:52,440
You have framed innocent people and put them in prison.

30
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:54,280
Aren't you afraid the emperor will blame you?

31
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:56,480
This imperial prison

32
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:58,800
is meant for those who are guilty, isn't it?

33
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:00,560
Since they are locked up here,

34
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,720
they must have committed crimes.

35
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:06,480
By the way, there are many condemned prisoners inside.

36
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,760
If anything happens to you, elder sister,

37
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:11,360
don't blame your younger brother for not protecting you well.

38
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,600
Princess.

39
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:13,880
You should leave first.

40
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:20,800
Jiang Wuyou

41
00:03:21,560 --> 00:03:23,440
How dare you threaten me?

42
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,880
Why not?

43
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:32,320
You were born to be threatened and oppressed.

44
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,960
When you were still in the Noble Consort's womb,

45
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,680
everyone in the palace thought you would be a prince.

46
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,520
You would be named crown prince at birth.

47
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:41,520
But unfortunately,

48
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:42,240
Insolence!

49
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:51,920
Come quickly!

50
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,560
Your Majesty

51
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,280
The Noble Consort's family holds great power.

52
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,000
If she gives birth to a prince,

53
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,520
there may be concerns about her family interfering in politics.

54
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:14,760
I suggest we follow Emperor Wu's example.

55
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,640
Remove the mother, keep the child.

56
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:17,440
How dare you!

57
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:21,080
The baby is coming out soon.

58
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:22,120
Push harder.

59
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,040
Push!

60
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,240
Noble Consort, push!

61
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,120
Your Majesty, please consider the good of the realm.

62
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,680
Accept Prince Qi's advice.

63
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,560
Relatives of the empress must not interfere in politics.

64
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:34,520
The baby is born!

65
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:35,400
It's born!

66
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,440
Reporting to Your Majesty,

67
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,040
a princess has been born.

68
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,120
Noble Consort

69
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:40,240
The Noble Consort is hemorrhaging.

70
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:42,280
She has passed away.

71
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:49,400
Rather than let you ruin my plans,

72
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:51,960
I'd be better off sending you on your way first.

73
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:15,560
Beichi

74
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:17,280
Siyan

75
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:18,080
You save them.

76
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,680
He

77
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,560
I'll handle the punishment.

78
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:23,480
Alright.

79
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:24,840
Let's go.

80
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,480
Hurry, go quickly!

81
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,440
Chu Beichi

82
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:52,920
You useless illegitimate son.

83
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:57,120
Do you know that rescuing a wanted criminal from the court is a crime punishable by extermination of your entire clan?

84
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,360
Do you believe it?

85
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,080
I'll wipe out your entire Chu family.

86
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:03,280
You slandered the Xuanjia Army.

87
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:05,320
You harmed the descendants of loyal officials.

88
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:07,800
The one who deserves to die a thousand times is you.

89
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,480
Oh, right.

90
00:06:11,640 --> 00:06:13,920
I almost forgot, you're also part of the Xuanjia Army.

91
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,760
If you dare, kill me.

92
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:17,920
Your life

93
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,080
I'll let you keep it.

94
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:23,720
I want you to confess your crimes in front of everyone.

95
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:27,080
Kneel and admit your guilt before the graves of the fallen soldiers.

96
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:29,920
As for how you die,

97
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:32,840
I'll let the people decide.

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,160
Chu Beichi

99
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:46,320
I want to cut you into a thousand pieces.

100
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,560
Young master

101
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,440
Mistress Jiu has already arranged for the family members.

102
00:06:54,680 --> 00:06:56,680
But our prince has been taken by the Empress.

103
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:57,800
What?

104
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:41,480
Qionghua

105
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:52,400
Kunlun Divine General

106
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,480
I have been waiting for you for a long time.

107
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:59,360
Where is Her Highness the Princess?

108
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:02,960
You ask about the Princess right away.

109
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,800
Is she really that important to you?

110
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:08,680
Nonsense.

111
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,720
Do you still remember nine years ago?

112
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,920
I was just a little girl.

113
00:08:22,640 --> 00:08:24,520
All I could do was watch your back.

114
00:08:26,880 --> 00:08:28,560
Mother was also killed by my brother.

115
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:30,640
I have nowhere left to go.

116
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,680
Please help me get revenge.

117
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,240
Hatred solves nothing.

118
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,600
Your mother entrusted you to me.

119
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:44,440
She hoped I could teach you the way of a wise ruler.

120
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,880
So that you could protect all the people in the future.

121
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:51,160
Once you understand,

122
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:53,480
I will teach you how to reclaim this kingdom.

123
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:56,400
And become the Empress of Beilie.

124
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:00,360
Military tactics are ever-changing.

125
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,440
Water has no fixed form.

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,440
Military tactics are ever-changing.

127
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:06,080
Water has no fixed form.

128
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:08,200
Victory often comes from the unexpected.

129
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:09,800
Only then can you win.

130
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,400
Often,

131
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:13,440
it is the element of surprise.

132
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,920
The Divine General has returned victorious again!

133
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,120
Master

134
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,120
Qionghua

135
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:57,640
Master

136
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,040
Now you have become the Empress.

137
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,280
I hope you will rule with benevolence.

138
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,680
From now on, we need not meet again.

139
00:11:05,640 --> 00:11:10,440
I once thought that standing above all others

140
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:14,960
and achieving everlasting glory would be enough.

141
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,800
But when I saw you walking away back then,

142
00:11:21,000 --> 00:11:22,320
I finally understood

143
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,480
that all I ever wanted was you.

144
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,200
That's enough.

145
00:11:41,640 --> 00:11:42,440
Qionghua,

146
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:46,800
back then, your brothers were bloodthirsty and cruel.

147
00:11:47,840 --> 00:11:48,760
I helped you

148
00:11:49,280 --> 00:11:51,360
so that Beilie would have a good emperor,

149
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,080
and so that less blood would be shed in the world.

150
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,520
These things,

151
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,720
I have never forgotten.

152
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:04,760
Now I rule over the thirteen kingdoms of Beilie.

153
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:08,160
My people want for nothing.

154
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:11,160
There is no more war within our borders.

155
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:13,120
But when it comes to you,

156
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:16,080
I have never stopped thinking about you.

157
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,480
I have obtained everything I ever wanted.

158
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,600
You,

159
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:24,400
I must have you as well.

160
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:26,120
Otherwise,

161
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,560
I will strip the Grand Princess of Datian

162
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:30,960
and throw her naked into the busy marketplace,

163
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,880
letting her die of shame and hunger.

164
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,520
Even if she survives,

165
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,960
she will never be able to hold her head high again.

166
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,520
You wouldn't dare.

167
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,720
Why wouldn't I dare?

168
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,480
During the three years you were unconscious,

169
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:45,560
do you think the Xuanjia Army

170
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:48,000
is still the same as before?

171
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:51,240
All these years, I haven't stationed troops at the border

172
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,520
because of you.

173
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,360
If you refuse,

174
00:12:55,840 --> 00:12:57,360
I will bathe the world in blood.

175
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,960
If you insist on going your own way,

176
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,920
then go ahead and try.

177
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:10,960
Let's see if your thirteen kingdoms will still obey you tomorrow.

178
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,880
You know very well I would never do that.

179
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,960
Yet you still refuse to offer even a single kind word.

180
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,840
Let me ask you,

181
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:49,800
Did you marry Princess Datian

182
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,680
truly out of gratitude for her three years of care and companionship?

183
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:58,400
Do you know that after the Kunlun Divine General disappeared,

184
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:01,520
it was Shen Feixue who shouldered everything alone?

185
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,960
The neighboring countries were all eyeing us covetously.

186
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:07,040
If I hadn't helped in secret,

187
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:11,600
how could things be as stable as they are now?

188
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:15,240
How could the Xuanjia Army have survived until now?

189
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,520
Siyan has lived in hiding and accompanied me for many years.

190
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,160
She and I are truly devoted to each other.

191
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:26,640
But you, in the end, are someone who yearns for power.

192
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,760
No matter how great the power,

193
00:14:30,760 --> 00:14:32,640
it still cannot control people's hearts.

194
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,240
Siyan.

195
00:14:55,080 --> 00:14:55,800
Let's go.

196
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,960
Chu Beichi.

197
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,360
I will definitely make you change your mind.

198
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,160
Change your mind...

199
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,280
Liuli.

200
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:12,720
Young Master Chu.

201
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:13,720
Something has happened.

202
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:16,200
The heir has taken away all the families of the Xuanjia Army.

203
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,320
How could this happen?

204
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:18,480
Not only that,

205
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:21,240
he has joined forces with the Empress of Beilie to set up a grand chess game.

206
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,360
The lives of the people now hang on the outcome of this game.

207
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:25,960
Jiuniang has already gone to stop them.
