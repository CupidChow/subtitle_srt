1
00:01:00,720 --> 00:01:02,960
Chu Beichi has committed the grave crime of regicide.

2
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,160
Heaven and earth will not tolerate this.

3
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:05,320
Execute him immediately.

4
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,360
Exterminate his entire clan.

5
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,960
Kneel down, kneel down!

6
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,720
Where is my son Feng Yu?

7
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:17,920
Feng Yu!

8
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,360
Come save us, quickly!

9
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:21,800
Brother-in-law, sister!

10
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,600
I don't want to die!

11
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:27,560
Chu Beichi!

12
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:30,840
Hand over the rebel leader now.

13
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:34,520
And confess your regicide before all the officials.

14
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,800
If you end your own life,

15
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:40,440
I can spare your Chu family.

16
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:45,560
If you dare harm even a hair on my Chu family,

17
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,040
I will repay you double.

18
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:50,560
Such bold words.

19
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,400
I

20
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,120
would like to see what you can do to me.

21
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,720
You, just a soldier,

22
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:59,760
what makes you think you can repay me double?

23
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:02,440
Because I am

24
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:05,640
the Divine General of Kunlun.

25
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:15,480
You claim to be the Divine General of Kunlun?

26
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:18,080
Absurd!

27
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,000
What are you all standing around for?

28
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,920
Kill that old man Chu Hong first!

29
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,240
Let this imposter

30
00:02:25,240 --> 00:02:27,640
watch his own father's head fall.

31
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,320
Chu Beichi!

32
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,560
The crime of regicide—

33
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:39,800
do you admit it or not?

34
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,040
Even if you are the Divine General of Kunlun,

35
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,920
with the charge of regicide,

36
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,880
you will still be doomed forever.

37
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,960
Who says I am dead?

38
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,600
Long live the Emperor! Long live! Long, long live!

39
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:13,840
Your Majesty,

40
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,080
you are safe and sound.

41
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:18,280
I am finally relieved.

42
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:25,600
Thanks to the Kunlun Divine General for protecting me.

43
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:27,520
Kunlun Divine General...

44
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:36,480
He really is...

45
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:37,720
That's right.

46
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:38,440
He...

47
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:39,920
Chu Beichi...

48
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:42,160
is the Kunlun Divine General.

49
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:51,120
So it turns out,

50
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,920
it was all a misunderstanding.

51
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,640
Royal Brother,

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,480
it's fortunate you arrived in time.

53
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,560
I truly thought you...

54
00:03:58,280 --> 00:04:00,560
I truly thought I had met with misfortune.

55
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:11,120
Kunlun Divine General Chu Beichi

56
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:13,440
has rendered great service to the nation many times.

57
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,080
There are no more titles I can grant him.

58
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:17,680
There are no more rewards I can give.

59
00:04:18,080 --> 00:04:19,720
Such great merit goes unrewarded.

60
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:22,440
All I can do is offer my thanks.

61
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:29,560
Deputy General Zhao Wudi of the Prince Qi's residence,

62
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:30,840
arrest him immediately.

63
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:31,920
Interrogate him strictly.

64
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,680
Find out the truth behind his impersonation of the Kunlun Divine General.

65
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,240
Young Master,

66
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,240
someone is waiting for you upstairs.

67
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:01,240
Chu Beichi,

68
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:03,240
I have repaid your favor.

69
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,080
Protect His Majesty well.

70
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,160
Someone must have used this poison

71
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,560
to force you to serve them.

72
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:29,480
Otherwise,

73
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:32,640
a member of the Southern Mystic Sect skilled in disguise

74
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:35,280
How could I willingly do such an assassination?

75
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,000
You actually know where I come from?

76
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:39,680
I not only know where you come from,

77
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,000
I can also help you find complete freedom.

78
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:45,520
But

79
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,800
you must agree to one condition first.

80
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:50,080
What condition?

81
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,000
If it weren't for the prescription you gave me last time,

82
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,360
which truly helped slow down the poison,

83
00:05:59,640 --> 00:06:00,640
otherwise,

84
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,360
I wouldn't have let these people go.

85
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:06,520
Now I have fulfilled my promise.

86
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:08,040
Where is the antidote?

87
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,200
You should know your own body best.

88
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:14,360
If you want the antidote,

89
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:16,640
what should you do?

90
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,000
You're not planning to go back on your word, are you?

91
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,280
Actually, what I want to say is,

92
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,840
the prescription I gave you last time is the antidote.

93
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:36,240
As long as you keep taking it,

94
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:37,680
the poison will be gone in less than half a year.

95
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,920
What I mean is,

96
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,200
you can't be someone else's pawn anymore.

97
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:46,840
You have to resist.

98
00:06:49,920 --> 00:06:50,800
Young master,

99
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:53,880
Sorry to interrupt you both.

100
00:06:58,320 --> 00:06:59,160
Young master,

101
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,120
Her Highness the Princess has arrived.

102
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:14,160
Come, Princess.

103
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,680
Siyan.

104
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:25,440
Chu Beichi.

105
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:38,600
Siyan.

106
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:40,480
We were just discussing important matters.

107
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,600
Young master,

108
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:46,160
I advise you not to say anything right now.

109
00:07:47,200 --> 00:07:48,240
No need to say more.

110
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,280
Of course, I trust my own husband.

111
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,680
Take care, I won't see you off.

112
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,280
By the way, there's something important.

113
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,880
After Zhao Wudi was imprisoned,

114
00:08:03,880 --> 00:08:05,040
no matter how he was interrogated,

115
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:07,120
he refused to reveal who was behind it.

116
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:09,760
He insisted it was all his doing alone.

117
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:11,520
When the jailer wasn't paying attention,

118
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,280
he killed himself by running into a wall.

119
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:15,240
Is that true?

120
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:18,600
His situation now

121
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:21,400
is exactly like the officials in the wrongful case of the deserters back then.

122
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:24,440
Even if we now conclude it was Prince Qi's doing,

123
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:26,160
there's no way to prove it since he's dead.

124
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,720
Your Majesty,

125
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:46,640
Prince Qi was only eager to protect Your Majesty.

126
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:49,280
His loyalty to Datian is unwavering.

127
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,080
Heaven and earth can bear witness to this.

128
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,040
I am willing to guarantee this with my life and family.

129
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,560
Prince Qi has no ulterior motives.

130
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,320
I have already investigated.

131
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,480
Zhao Wudi rebelled to avenge the young prince's death.

132
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,360
It has nothing to do with Prince Qi.

133
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:14,720
But Chu Beichi, relying on his status as the Kunlun Divine General, killed a royal in public without permission.

134
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,480
His arrogance is what caused this chaos.

135
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,360
I ask Your Majesty to punish him.

136
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:27,160
If Your Majesty punishes Prince Qi,

137
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,320
I will speak out for Prince Qi's innocence.

138
00:09:29,520 --> 00:09:30,720
Even if it costs me my life.

139
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,280
The civil and military officials listed in this booklet

140
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:45,800
usually appear to be neutral

141
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:47,240
and show no signs of siding with Prince Qi.

142
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,040
However,

143
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,920
in cases like the wrongful conviction of the deserter and the false general incident,

144
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,680
at every critical juncture,

145
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,560
they actively lean toward Prince Qi's faction.

146
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,160
Are you saying

147
00:09:58,520 --> 00:10:00,080
these people are all secretly in contact with Prince Qi?

148
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:04,720
But among them, there are also

149
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:06,600
upright and principled officials.

150
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,400
No one is a sage.

151
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
Who can be without fault?

152
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:16,600
Especially in a place as complicated as the officialdom.

153
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,680
In the ups and downs of official life,

154
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:20,080
how could there be no mistakes at all?

155
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:22,200
If someone seizes on their weaknesses,

156
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,640
they can only continue making mistakes.

157
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,760
Fortunately, this time

158
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,800
you stabilized the situation as the Kunlun Divine General.

159
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,960
And you didn't let military power fall into outside hands.

160
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:35,680
Otherwise,

161
00:10:35,960 --> 00:10:38,680
I'm afraid our Datian kingdom would have changed hands.

162
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:41,720
What we see now

163
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,920
is probably just the tip of the iceberg.

164
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:49,360
Prince Qi is truly capable,

165
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,440
controlling so many people for his own use.

166
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,720
When you think about it,

167
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,720
it's really unbelievable.

168
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,040
Prince Qi has been planning for years.

169
00:10:58,240 --> 00:10:59,880
To gather intelligence on such a large scale,

170
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
if it were only passed on by word of mouth,

171
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,920
there would surely be omissions.

172
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,880
There must be some written records and files.

173
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,760
That way,

174
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:09,520
he can pressure his officials whenever he needs to.

175
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:16,480
If we can get our hands on this booklet,

176
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:19,080
could we shake Prince Qi's foundation at little cost?

177
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:20,360
undermine Prince Qi's very foundation?

178
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:21,160
Yes.

179
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,240
Commander of the Imperial Guards, Liu Wuzhou

180
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:37,360
According to our investigation

181
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,200
Liu Wuzhou is upright and incorruptible

182
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:40,560
He is trusted by His Majesty

183
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:42,080
He commands the capital's imperial guards

184
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:45,400
However, a few years ago, he was implicated in a case of missing military provisions

185
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:47,040
Later, someone else took the blame

186
00:11:47,080 --> 00:11:49,680
So the case was left unresolved

187
00:11:50,640 --> 00:11:52,000
This must be his mistake

188
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:53,200
Impossible

189
00:11:56,920 --> 00:11:57,400
Yes

190
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,600
Impossible

191
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,640
Liu Wuzhou is Liuli's father

192
00:12:02,040 --> 00:12:03,600
He is also a loyal and righteous man

193
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:27,800
Chu Beichi

194
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:32,040
Every person harbors a bit of darkness in their heart

195
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,640
It cannot be cut through by any blade

196
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:37,920
Even the most loyal ministers and generals

197
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,120
Still have fatal weaknesses
