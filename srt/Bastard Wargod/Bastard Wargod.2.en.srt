1
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,240
Feng Yu

2
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:57,640
Mother

3
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,920
Feng Yu, you're finally back.

4
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:01,640
You have to judge for us.

5
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,520
The Chu family took good care of him while he was recovering.

6
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,240
But as soon as he woke up, he started losing his temper at us.

7
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:09,640
He's become so arrogant.

8
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:12,640
You have to stand up for us.

9
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,080
Feng Yu

10
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:18,240
Your brother has gone mad.

11
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:21,200
He even dared to burn the ancestral hall.

12
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:22,680
Father, Mother

13
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:24,560
You don't need to panic.

14
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:27,160
These past years, I've received guidance from the Divine General.

15
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:28,920
The Divine General said

16
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,960
that in a few days, there will be a ceremony to present me with a weapon.

17
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,120
At that time,

18
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,000
I will take on the important responsibility of the Northern Territory.

19
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:38,120
You truly are my good son, Chu Hong.

20
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,640
You haven't let your father down.

21
00:01:44,200 --> 00:01:45,760
Three years of training in the North,

22
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,160
and yet you've become like this.

23
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:54,840
What,

24
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:56,160
are you jealous?

25
00:01:58,440 --> 00:01:59,240
Well, I suppose so.

26
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,600
Just dealing with a group of blood bandits

27
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:03,040
was enough to leave you in this state.

28
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,280
To cure you,

29
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,960
all the money and food in Binzhou

30
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:08,080
have almost been drained because of you.

31
00:02:08,520 --> 00:02:09,400
You being alive

32
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,680
is a disgrace to the Chu family.

33
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,480
The world is so vast,

34
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,080
yet you only see the tiny Chu family.

35
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,040
You really are like frogs at the bottom of a well.

36
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:22,080
There's no need to say more to them.

37
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,520
Starting today

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:35,320
I, Chu Beichi, will choose to leave the Chu family

39
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,000
From now on, whatever happens to the Chu family

40
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,280
will have nothing to do with me

41
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:43,080
Burning down the ancestral hall

42
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,480
Such outrageous defiance

43
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,880
How has the Chu family ever wronged you?

44
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,520
Everyone, you all heard that, right?

45
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,200
Assaulted his uncle and stepmother

46
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,960
Set fire to and destroyed the ancestral hall

47
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,240
Even tried to take all the Chu family's wealth

48
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:08,520
This way, family heads, please

49
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,880
What kind of person is this Chu Beichi, really?

50
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:13,560
I'm sure you all have an idea by now

51
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:20,560
Why are the family heads all here?

52
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,920
Today we happened to see General Chu return in triumph

53
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,560
We didn't expect to witness such a scene

54
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,200
Chu Beichi

55
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:30,960
He did save our Li family back then

56
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:32,640
But just because of this old favor

57
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:35,320
He forced us to provide money and grain for three years

58
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:36,560
Young Master Chu

59
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,200
Aren't you being a bit too greedy?

60
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:43,360
Now that Chu Beichi has recovered

61
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,760
You all don't need to provide silver anymore

62
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,560
I was just advising Beichi about this

63
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,680
But he insisted on refusing

64
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,160
He even fought with us

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,280
If Feng Yu hadn't returned in time

66
00:03:56,280 --> 00:03:58,720
Who knows how bad things would have gotten

67
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,160
Over these past few years

68
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,360
If our Wang family hadn't connected with Jiu Niang

69
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:05,680
Who knows how many in our family

70
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,480
would have starved because you, Chu Beichi, extorted money under the pretense of illness

71
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:09,480
Exactly

72
00:04:10,240 --> 00:04:11,440
Jiu Niang

73
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,560
It's said Jiu Niang has great influence

74
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,760
And is as wealthy as a nation

75
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,200
Ordinary people can only dream of meeting her

76
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:22,080
What, are you scared?

77
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,480
Don't worry

78
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,480
You all should

79
00:04:27,880 --> 00:04:29,280
be able to see her very soon

80
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,440
If Jiu Niang really comes

81
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,920
you'll be dead for sure

82
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,400
Three

83
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,800
So it was them who wanted to harm the young master.

84
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,040
Kill him.

85
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:47,640
Yes.

86
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:49,600
Stop wasting words with him.

87
00:04:50,040 --> 00:04:52,440
Leaving this scoundrel alive will only bring trouble.

88
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,600
We might as well kill him today.

89
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,920
That would settle everything once and for all.

90
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,880
Master.

91
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:00,360
What do you think?

92
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,240
Yes, let's have Lord Chu decide.

93
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,880
It's not that your father won't give you a way out.

94
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:17,560
If you hadn't made such a grave mistake before,

95
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,000
things wouldn't have come to this today.

96
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,640
The Chu family only keeps those who are useful.

97
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,720
You—

98
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,120
You should end your own life.

99
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:29,640
Two

100
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,320
Two? What do you mean, two?

101
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,960
Master.

102
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,720
Since he refuses to kill himself,

103
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,560
then carry him to the pond.

104
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,800
Let him drown there.

105
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:39,880
Go.

106
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:48,240
General Chu, your martial skills are unmatched.

107
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:49,320
You should do it.

108
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,280
Feng Yu!

109
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,520
How is this possible?

110
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:55,000
This—

111
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:56,680
Even General Chu is being overpowered!

112
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,560
Yes, how can this be?

113
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,600
One

114
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:06,480
Who gave you the courage to do this?

115
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:13,880
Hyah!

116
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:15,480
Hyah!

117
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,120
Hyah!

118
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:17,560
Hyah!

119
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,720
The war has ended.

120
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,760
Why is General Shen still wearing bloodstained armor?

121
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,160
It's so inauspicious.

122
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,640
Even if you travel day and night without rest,

123
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:50,480
I'm afraid you'll still come up empty-handed.

124
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:52,920
Oh.

125
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,360
I suppose the Empress is determined to succeed this time.

126
00:06:57,240 --> 00:07:00,480
But don't forget who I am.

127
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,480
Even if you are the Empress of Beilie,

128
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,720
I still won't admit defeat or give in.

129
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:12,040
Report!

130
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:15,720
Report!

131
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:17,960
Your Majesty.

132
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,480
General Shen.

133
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,640
As expected, those closest get the first advantage.

134
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:32,360
Even a widow dares to covet the Divine General of Kunlun.

135
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:34,160
But Jiu Niang got there first.

136
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,600
And that miracle doctor too.

137
00:07:42,920 --> 00:07:44,080
We can't fall behind.

138
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,640
Giddy up!

139
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:47,560
Go! Go! Go!

140
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:52,320
It's fine.

141
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,240
I'll let you all fight it out first.

142
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:56,640
Because

143
00:07:57,160 --> 00:07:58,640
Commander Chu, Chu Beichi,

144
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,960
can only be mine, only belong to me.
