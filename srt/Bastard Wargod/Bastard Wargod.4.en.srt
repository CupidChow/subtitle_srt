1
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,440
That's the Blood Bandits' ink-marked sky lantern.

2
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:07,800
The remnants of the Blood Bandits have resurfaced.

3
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,880
They want to massacre Binzhou.

4
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:11,000
They're planning to slaughter everyone in Binzhou City.

5
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:12,640
None of us can escape.

6
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:13,800
What should we do?

7
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:14,960
General Chu,

8
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:17,160
please save Binzhou City.

9
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,640
Protect our lives.

10
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:21,520
We are willing to offer all our wealth.

11
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,960
They're just Blood Bandits.

12
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:27,840
It's a piece of cake.

13
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,920
Watch how I wipe them out.

14
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,080
General Chu is calm and composed.

15
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,760
Truly the bearing of a great general.

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,520
With General Chu taking charge,

17
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,120
how could we not sleep soundly at night?

18
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,120
If you leave now,

19
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:44,400
I can still spare you for the sake of peace between the army and the people.

20
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,760
Who do you think you are?

21
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,160
How dare you show off in front of me?

22
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,360
You probably haven't heard of my name.

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,760
I am the successor of the Kunlun Divine General.

24
00:01:54,760 --> 00:01:56,640
I am the Grand General of Zhenyuan, Chu Fengyu.

25
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,440
Kunlun Divine General?

26
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,600
You think you're worthy?

27
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:00,720
General Chu,

28
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,000
don't waste time with this bandit.

29
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,280
Execute him on the spot!

30
00:02:03,400 --> 00:02:04,400
Hurry, hurry!

31
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:15,680
General Chu!

32
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:16,920
Go!

33
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:18,960
Go!

34
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:19,920
My son, go quickly!

35
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,880
Fengyu!

36
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:42,600
General Chu is fighting in person.

37
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,000
How could this happen?

38
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,920
Since that's the case,

39
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,680
then I'll show no mercy.

40
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:16,960
Who is it

41
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:18,000
who shot down the sky lantern

42
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:20,320
This is declaring war on the Blood Bandits

43
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:23,000
Even General Chu is no match for them

44
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,240
Who is so bold

45
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,400
We're all going to die at the hands of the Blood Bandits

46
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,280
It was me

47
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:32,400
Beichi

48
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:34,640
You've caused a huge disaster

49
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:36,640
They'll torture you to death

50
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,640
You'll implicate the entire Chu family

51
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,000
The whole city's people will die because of you

52
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,440
You look down on others like a dog

53
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:53,960
Today I'll show you

54
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:56,040
the true strength of our Young Master Chu

55
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:57,920
Chu Beichi

56
00:03:58,480 --> 00:03:59,960
Go die in my place

57
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,640
I wiped out all the Blood Bandits three years ago

58
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:14,920
Who are you really

59
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:22,000
Hurry, go

60
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:33,840
Did you see that

61
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,160
As soon as Young Master Chu arrived

62
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:37,240
he scared the Blood Bandits into kneeling

63
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:40,360
You little thief, why aren't you running yet

64
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:44,000
Retreat

65
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,440
Fall back

66
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:50,280
Siyan

67
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,520
This...

68
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:55,240
Let's go first

69
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:01,840
Beichi

70
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:04,440
How could the Blood Bandits be scared off by him?

71
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:06,520
How could he have such ability?

72
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:07,960
Why?

73
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:10,520
Why did the Blood Bandits leave as soon as they saw him?

74
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,480
Chu Beichi must be colluding with the Blood Bandits.

75
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,320
He's a cripple.

76
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,960
How could he possibly scare off the Blood Bandits?

77
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:18,680
Could it be that three years ago...

78
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,040
he was the one colluding with the Blood Bandits?

79
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,600
Now he wants to use the same trick again.

80
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:23,280
If that's really the case,

81
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:25,400
I will make sure to punish him severely.

82
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:26,440
Give us justice!

83
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:29,880
Give us justice!

84
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,000
The Northern female general, Shen Feixue, has arrived!

85
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,120
It's Sister Feixue!

86
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,360
It must be Sister Feixue who arrived.

87
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,000
That's why they ran away.

88
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:44,240
So it really had nothing to do with Chu Beichi.

89
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:48,000
General Shen must have come for my son Feng Yu.

90
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,200
If that's the case,

91
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,320
it's as if my son saved the whole city.

92
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:57,400
Thanks to General Chu,

93
00:05:57,760 --> 00:06:00,920
General Shen Feixue came to help.

94
00:06:00,920 --> 00:06:03,400
We will never forget this life-saving favor.

95
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:04,600
Everyone,

96
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,560
at tomorrow's sword-giving ceremony,

97
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,240
I will ask General Shen Feixue to judge him personally.

98
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:10,880
Good!

99
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,880
Good son!

100
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:22,640
I just wanted to teach Chu Fengyu a small lesson.

101
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:23,960
I didn't expect

102
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,960
it would turn into a Blood Bandit incident.

103
00:06:26,160 --> 00:06:27,200
Sorry.

104
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,280
It's okay.

105
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:32,040
Young master,

106
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,520
look at the grand entrance General Shen made.

107
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,000
She cleared out my entire Ruyi Pavilion.

108
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:45,440
Greetings, Commander Chu.

109
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:47,880
You’re finally awake.

110
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:51,760
Feixue.

111
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:54,480
The Xuanjia Army owes much to you these past years.

112
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:55,680
Well done.

113
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:03,880
Feixue.

114
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:06,240
From today onward,

115
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:08,520
you are the greatest female general in the land.

116
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,240
From now on,

117
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,280
you must protect our borders and bring peace to the people.

118
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,080
Safeguard the nation and ensure its stability.

119
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,480
Thank you, Commander Chu.

120
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,840
This is the famed female general, Shen Feixue.

121
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,840
Truly a heroine among women.

122
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:31,120
Three years ago,

123
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,880
after you led the vanguard cavalry in a bloody battle,

124
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:35,800
you just wanted to return home and live as an ordinary person.

125
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:37,800
But to save the people of Binzhou,

126
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:38,880
you were poisoned by the Blood Bandits.

127
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,400
Who would have thought the entire Chu household would be so heartless?

128
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,080
I will reveal your identity to them right away.

129
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:49,400
There are still matters I need to take care of.

130
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,200
My identity cannot be revealed for now.

131
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:54,520
Since General Shen is here,

132
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:57,280
please stay at my Ruyi Pavilion for a meal.

133
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,280
Everyone, let's begin the meal.

134
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,440
Commander Chu, please wait.

135
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:44,680
What do you mean by that?

136
00:08:44,680 --> 00:08:45,400
Feixue.

137
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:46,840
Sit down.

138
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:48,360
Eat.

139
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,320
Doctor Jiang.

140
00:09:01,840 --> 00:09:03,160
You've served Commander Chu for three years.

141
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:06,400
Now it's time for you to step back after your success.

142
00:09:07,560 --> 00:09:09,320
General Shen, you must be joking.

143
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:11,280
Young Master Chu and I

144
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:15,280
have been together day and night for the past three years.

145
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,800
We are definitely inseparable.

146
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,200
Let's eat.

147
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,400
Don't think that just because you control all the intelligence in the world

148
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:31,920
you can be disrespectful in front of Commander Chu.

149
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,240
Even though General Shen is a military person,

150
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:37,480
she still has some girlish thoughts.

151
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:38,560
Childish.

152
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:40,160
Can we just eat properly?

153
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:56,880
Now everyone in the city says you're colluding with the Blood Bandits.

154
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:00,560
Chu Fengyu has announced that at the gun ceremony

155
00:10:00,920 --> 00:10:04,400
he'll have Shen Feixue interrogate you personally.

156
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:08,720
Commander Chu.

157
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,000
Three years ago, you said you would hold this gun ceremony for him.

158
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:15,480
In my opinion, it's better to cancel it.

159
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,120
In a few days, I'll have him bow and apologize to you.

160
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,200
No.

161
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:25,160
Not only can this gun ceremony not be canceled,

162
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,200
it must be held on a grand scale.

163
00:10:29,480 --> 00:10:31,040
My own reputation is a small matter.

164
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:34,320
But I represent the entire Xuanjia Army.

165
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:35,760
So,

166
00:10:36,360 --> 00:10:37,680
this gun ceremony cannot be canceled.

167
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:38,920
Yes.

168
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,160
Then there will be quite a show to see.

169
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,760
However,

170
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,560
why is one person missing?

171
00:10:55,640 --> 00:10:56,440
Feixue

172
00:10:56,960 --> 00:10:57,960
My beloved disciple

173
00:10:58,480 --> 00:10:59,800
Was she stopped by you?

174
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:03,840
How could Feixue possibly stop the Empress of Beilie?

175
00:11:04,360 --> 00:11:05,320
She said

176
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,600
she wanted to prepare a grand gift for you.

177
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,240
A grand gift?

178
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:17,160
Eat.

179
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:30,400
Chu Beichi

180
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:33,600
The thirteen kingdoms of Beilie

181
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,840
are my betrothal gift.

182
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,120
Tomorrow

183
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,640
Are you ready?
