1
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:02,640
Let us out.

2
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:03,960
Let us out.

3
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:08,760
My son is not a deserter.

4
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:11,240
My husband is not a deserter.

5
00:01:11,440 --> 00:01:13,120
Let us out.

6
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:14,640
Stop.

7
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,320
Release those innocent people.

8
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,560
Let us take their place as hostages.

9
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,360
Their loved ones are either buried in foreign lands,

10
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:23,440
or their lives hang by a thread on the battlefield.

11
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:26,600
If loyalty and righteousness only lead to broken families,

12
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,200
who would still dare to serve Datian?

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,440
We have nothing to lose.

14
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:30,520
Let us go instead.

15
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:31,640
Yes.

16
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:32,600
Let us go instead.

17
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:33,480
Let us go instead.

18
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:34,640
Let us go instead.

19
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:35,320
I'm willing to go.

20
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,160
We're willing to go.

21
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:37,360
I'm willing to go.

22
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:43,840
Prostitutes paired with deserters' families.

23
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,800
Truly, the lowly match with the lowly.

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,040
If you ask me,

25
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,160
they should all be arrested.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:57,920
You—

27
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,880
You—

28
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:05,680
How entertaining, truly entertaining.

29
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,120
Chu Beichi can actually make a group of prostitutes show themselves for him.

30
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,400
Enough with the nonsense.

31
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,040
What will it take to release them?

32
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:21,760
Speak.

33
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,560
Why didn't Chu Beichi come?

34
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,920
This game was set up by the prince especially for Chu Beichi.

35
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:31,760
Why send a group of women to take the risk?

36
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,160
Are you waiting for me?

37
00:02:41,240 --> 00:02:42,640
Release them.

38
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:44,800
Chu Beichi.

39
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,600
If you have the guts, kill me.

40
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:49,240
I'll make them all die with me.

41
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,560
Why are we being imprisoned?

42
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,240
Let us out.

43
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:54,560
We are innocent.

44
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:55,480
Let us out.

45
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,280
Let us out.

46
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:01,000
Chu Beichi.

47
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:01,720
How dare you.

48
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,720
Killing the young prince is a crime that will wipe out your entire clan.

49
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:09,720
Jiang Wuyou.

50
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,640
You falsely accused the Xuanjia Army.

51
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:12,800
And harmed their families.

52
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:14,760
I will report everything to the Emperor.

53
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,720
If you don't release them today,

54
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:18,240
don't blame me for being ruthless.

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:20,480
Release them.

56
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:28,240
I'm afraid even if he wants to release them now, he can't.

57
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,240
This is Beilie’s Heaven and Earth Chessboard.

58
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,120
It tests the intelligence of those who play.

59
00:03:46,120 --> 00:03:47,000
Strategy,

60
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,360
and inner strength.

61
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:52,320
Each piece on the board weighs a thousand pounds.

62
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:54,200
To move them forward,

63
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:55,840
one must have profound inner strength.

64
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:57,760
If your inner strength is lacking,

65
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:01,920
you won't be able to seize the opportunity, even if it's heaven-sent.

66
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:03,800
I said before,

67
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:05,880
I will get you in my own way.

68
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:07,960
Even if it means destroying you in the end,

69
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,000
I won't hesitate.

70
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,160
As the challenger in this contest,

71
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,640
if you can solve the puzzle,

72
00:04:23,960 --> 00:04:25,360
the cage will open on its own.

73
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,240
But if you fail,

74
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,520
or stand still for too long,

75
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,880
as the defender,

76
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:33,360
the fuse mechanism below will ignite within the time it takes for an incense stick to burn.

77
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,720
The explosives will then detonate.

78
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:37,440
I forgot to remind you,

79
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,280
don’t even think about breaking open the cage directly.

80
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,280
Because the fuse beneath the cage is connected to several mechanisms.

81
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,320
So if you want to save them,

82
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,600
solving the puzzle

83
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:49,040
is the only way.

84
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:59,440
If you agree to my terms now,

85
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:02,520
I will release them.

86
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:03,800
Otherwise,

87
00:05:07,040 --> 00:05:07,840
I’ll do it.

88
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:12,160
Beichi.

89
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:12,840
Young master.

90
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:29,080
Beichi

91
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:30,440
You must win.

92
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:35,040
This kid is all show and no substance.

93
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,640
Might as well just kill them directly.

94
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,360
At least they'd die quickly.

95
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,160
Exactly.

96
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:40,920
I'm afraid the game will end before a single move is made.

97
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,640
This match will be over.

98
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:44,520
If that's the case,

99
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,760
the families of those deserters are doomed.

100
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,600
Every piece on the board carries great weight.

101
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,040
If Young Master Chu rushes into battle,

102
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,360
what are his chances of winning?

103
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:53,600
If he can't win,

104
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,240
then no one in this world can win this game.

105
00:05:58,760 --> 00:05:59,560
Your Majesty,

106
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,240
if we join forces,

107
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,160
our great cause will surely succeed.

108
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:07,360
My cause is not the same as yours.

109
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,880
Master,

110
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:13,240
I'm sorry.

111
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:15,760
No matter how you see me,

112
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,160
I only want you

113
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,480
to let us go.

114
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,640
They are not deserters.

115
00:06:21,640 --> 00:06:23,800
Please save us.

116
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:27,080
Let us out.

117
00:06:27,760 --> 00:06:29,960
The Xuanjia Army always wears iron masks.

118
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:31,640
It's only to intimidate enemy nations.

119
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:32,800
To protect our land and bring peace to the people.

120
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:36,080
So many never get to enjoy military honors

121
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,560
or receive rewards.

122
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:41,160
They can only die nameless on the battlefield.

123
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,280
I, Chu Beichi, swear here

124
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:46,720
that I will save you.

125
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,160
Please trust the Xuanjia Army.

126
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:52,960
And please trust me.

127
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:54,360
We believe in you.

128
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:56,520
We believe in you.

129
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,960
We believe in you.

130
00:07:01,880 --> 00:07:03,240
I really want to see

131
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,040
how you plan to break this chess game.

132
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,760
Let's begin.

133
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:27,000
Everyone saw it.

134
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,800
My consort has deep inner strength.

135
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:30,400
He gained the advantage right from the start.

136
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:32,800
Chu Beichi,

137
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:35,200
I thought you had some tricks up your sleeve.

138
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:37,120
All brawn and no brains.

139
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:38,320
Utterly foolish.

140
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,560
Who opens a game by moving the knight?

141
00:07:41,640 --> 00:07:43,680
Chu Fengyu, be quiet for me.

142
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,200
It's only the first round,

143
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,720
and you already traded a cannon for a chariot.

144
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,320
Isn't that a huge loss?

145
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:02,960
Chu Beichi,

146
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,360
Did you just wake up not long ago,

147
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:05,640
and your mind hasn't recovered yet?

148
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,160
How can you be so reckless?

149
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:11,360
Or is this a feint?

150
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,280
You lost both cannons at the start.

151
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:33,840
Even a fool can see that.

152
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:34,880
You're bound to lose.

153
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:37,520
Chu Beichi,

154
00:08:37,960 --> 00:08:39,240
keep playing.

155
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:40,960
I want to see

156
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,640
how you end up as a lone general.

157
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,600
You plan ten moves ahead,

158
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,360
but only make one move.

159
00:08:47,720 --> 00:08:49,040
Thousands of troops

160
00:08:49,520 --> 00:08:51,000
are all under your command.

161
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,880
Give them hope

162
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,560
Then take that hope away

163
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:31,000
Chu Beichi, you really are pathetic

164
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,360
Chu Beichi

165
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,240
You

166
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:44,880
A feint in the open, a real move in secret

167
00:10:23,400 --> 00:10:24,680
A single chariot and ten pawns are in dire straits.

168
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,560
He actually abandoned the chariot to save the horse.

169
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:27,520
We should trust him.

170
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:28,600
Does he not want to win anymore?

171
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:32,160
If that's the case,

172
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,400
at best, it will only be a draw.

173
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,160
But as the challenger,

174
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,960
he's still bound to lose.

175
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,600
Help me.

176
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:43,640
Help me.

177
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,280
Help me.

178
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:53,800
Military tactics are never fixed.

179
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,080
Water has no constant form.

180
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:58,640
Victory often comes from the unexpected.

181
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:05,520
The Xuanjia Army fought bravely to protect the nation.

182
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,520
Yet they must bear such grave accusations.

183
00:11:08,280 --> 00:11:10,600
Good generals are imprisoned, loyal ministers wronged.

184
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:11,920
In this world,

185
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,640
who else would dare to defend it?
