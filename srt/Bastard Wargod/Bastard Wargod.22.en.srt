1
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,000
This imperial edict was left to Your Majesty by the late emperor.

2
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,000
I was fortunate enough to have seen it.

3
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Only then did I learn that Your Highness and His Majesty are full siblings.

4
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:30,600
But the late emperor had long seen that Your Highness was

5
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:32,960
a dark and harmful presence.

6
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:35,200
Not fit to be a ruler.

7
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:38,920
That is why you were entrusted to an ordinary concubine.

8
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,600
So you would give up any such ambitions.

9
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:44,560
And allow His Majesty to ascend the throne smoothly.

10
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:46,520
Father Emperor.

11
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,600
Why did you look down on me so much

12
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:51,120
and keep this from your son?

13
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,440
Heaven and earth are merciless.

14
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,840
They treat all things as straw dogs.

15
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:58,640
The reason you could not ascend the throne

16
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,720
was not because of your birth.

17
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,480
It was because of your own shortcomings.

18
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,520
The late emperor originally wanted to give you

19
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:08,880
a reason to accept your fate.

20
00:02:10,200 --> 00:02:11,200
But he did not expect

21
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:14,280
your resentment would only grow deeper.

22
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,160
Father Emperor.

23
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,680
You deceived your son so bitterly.

24
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:24,440
In what way am I inferior to him?

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,880
Father Emperor.

26
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:52,000
In what way am I inferior to him?

27
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,880
The prince's residence is already surrounded.

28
00:02:54,880 --> 00:02:56,000
No one can escape.

29
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:00,440
Only you can take this out.

30
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:04,360
If Prince Qi does not let you go,

31
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,400
I will carve a bloody path for you.

32
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:09,920
Calm yourself.

33
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,280
You go first.

34
00:03:29,480 --> 00:03:30,520
Your Highness.

35
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,320
Since you already know the truth,

36
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,600
I will take my leave.

37
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,920
General Kunlun, please wait.

38
00:03:50,960 --> 00:03:53,280
I have always been cautious and careful.

39
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:58,000
Today, a few little mice suddenly appeared in my residence.

40
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:00,720
How could I possibly not notice?

41
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:02,920
Guards!

42
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,240
Bring them in.

43
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:05,120
Yes, sir.

44
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:06,160
Move.

45
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,880
Let me go!

46
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:08,600
Let me go!

47
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:09,440
Move.

48
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:18,160
Something was just stolen from the residence.

49
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,280
I suspect these people are involved.

50
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:25,360
But the item is not on them.

51
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:27,880
Do you know, General?

52
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,800
Your name is Jiu Niang.

53
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,160
You are the confidante of the Kunlun General.

54
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:49,400
Or the widow of a Northern Army soldier.

55
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:51,360
I suppose

56
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,560
he values you greatly.

57
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,560
But stealing from me

58
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,880
is a capital offense.

59
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,480
With just one word from me,

60
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,560
does the General still want

61
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,640
this beauty's life?

62
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,320
Princess.

63
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:28,840
My lord, Prince Qi has given an order.

64
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:31,080
If Jiang Siyan dares to act rashly, execute him on the spot.

65
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:40,080
Having a fine general like Lord Liu guarding the capital

66
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,120
is truly a blessing for our dynasty.

67
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,160
I am humbled.

68
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,560
Allow me to toast Your Highness.

69
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:19,200
Unfortunately, it's all too late.

70
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,040
Guards!

71
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:25,440
Master Liu.

72
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:30,600
Of course.

73
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:33,560
If this matter has nothing to do with you,

74
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,080
I offer my apologies here.

75
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,520
You may leave freely.

76
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,640
As for these little rats,

77
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:46,120
they will all receive the punishment they deserve.

78
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:50,560
I don't know what you lost.

79
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:53,080
Kill or torture me, do as you wish.

80
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:54,480
Enough with the nonsense.

81
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,800
So it seems I truly misunderstood.

82
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:04,800
Your Highness.

83
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,480
You only lost one thing.

84
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,520
Why go to such extremes?

85
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,560
I don't want to either.

86
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:15,600
But this item is truly important.

87
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,680
If it leaves the palace,

88
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,120
the consequences would be unimaginable.

89
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:27,040
Acting on impulse comes with a price.

90
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,880
Especially for someone who did such a foolish thing,

91
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,720
and is actually a smart person.

92
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,400
So it was indeed found by the Divine General.

93
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:51,640
Since that's the case,

94
00:07:51,920 --> 00:07:53,600
let it be returned to its rightful owner.

95
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,480
Alright.

96
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,240
But release them first.

97
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,640
In this game of human nature,

98
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:02,120
I have never lost.

99
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:04,080
But the Divine General

100
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,360
is different from me

101
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:09,280
and from most people.

102
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,280
They are not chess pieces.

103
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,800
They are living, breathing people.

104
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:17,240
Heaven and earth are the board,

105
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:18,520
all things are the pieces.

106
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,920
Only with proper judgment

107
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,360
can great things be accomplished.

108
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,360
Young Master.

109
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
Kunlun Divine General

110
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:41,960
There will be plenty of time in the future.

111
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,080
Let's go.

112
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:57,840
News just came from the Prince's Imperial Guard camp.

113
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,520
Jiang Siyan went to the Privy Council this time

114
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,840
only to reward the Imperial Guards for their defense.

115
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:03,920
He left as soon as the rewards were given.

116
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,360
It doesn't seem like he was targeting the Prince.

117
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:14,080
Well?

118
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:15,120
What about the Book of Life and Death?

119
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:16,320
I was incompetent.

120
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,720
I fell into Prince Qi's trap instead.

121
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,600
I failed to get the Book of Life and Death.

122
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:22,320
It's all right.

123
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:25,120
Prince Qi is cunning by nature.

124
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,400
Let's think of another way.

125
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:29,400
Jiuniang.

126
00:09:29,400 --> 00:09:30,360
Bring paper and brush.

127
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,520
What is written in the Book of Life and Death

128
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,200
is all here.

129
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,040
My lord,

130
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,320
when you retrieved the Book of Life and Death just now,

131
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:28,000
why didn't you just kill them?

132
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,880
After all, Chu Beichi is the Divine General of Kunlun.

133
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:35,240
To go all out against him now

134
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,520
would be premature.

135
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:40,000
If

136
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:43,520
he has already read the Book of Life and Death,

137
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:47,600
then he is probably already dead by now.

138
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:50,880
Beichi!

139
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:51,400
Young master!

140
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,360
Young master!

141
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:57,560
How could this happen to the young master?

142
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,480
I

143
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:03,920
specifically mixed a rare and deadly poison into the pulp

144
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,680
when making the Book of Life and Death.

145
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:08,760
This was to prevent anyone from coveting it.

146
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:11,320
All these years,

147
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,520
I have been testing the poison on myself little by little,

148
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:18,080
so my body could adapt as much as possible.

149
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:21,040
But I still have to take the antidote in advance

150
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:23,040
to be able to read it even once.

151
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:25,440
Anyone else who dares to read it

152
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:27,280
will surely die.

153
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,000
From now on,

154
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:32,800
the guilty officials of this dynasty

155
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,800
will all become the heroes of the new dynasty.

156
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,080
Beichi!

157
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,480
Is the young master alright?
