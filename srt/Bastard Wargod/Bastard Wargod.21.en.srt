1
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:03,280
This way.

2
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:19,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

3
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,240
So that means,

4
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:26,200
His Majesty discussed it with Chu Beichi before he left.

5
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,520
They're planning to deal with me.

6
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,080
The Kunlun Divine General is quite ambitious.

7
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:34,520
Not only that,

8
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:37,320
Chu Beichi and the Princess, outside the city, also...

9
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,240
Also what?

10
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:50,440
They said...

11
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:04,360
Oh, right.

12
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,760
After all, Prince Qi has many followers.

13
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,640
If we act against him rashly,

14
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:10,920
his foundation in the court is so strong,

15
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,080
it will definitely set off a chain reaction.

16
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,560
In the end, it’s the common people who will suffer.

17
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:21,920
Starting a war is not what I want.

18
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:23,840
Siyan.

19
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:26,800
Go to the main camp and resolve this swiftly.

20
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,720
I will help you capture him in one move.

21
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:31,760
Don’t worry.

22
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,720
I’ll contact some trustworthy commanders in the capital’s Imperial Guards.

23
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:36,080
We’ll work with them.

24
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,520
We’ll catch them like turtles in a jar.

25
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:49,160
You really have thought of everything.

26
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:50,960
It’s just a pity...

27
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,920
This servant will take his leave.

28
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,480
The capital’s defenses have been tight lately.

29
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:03,840
Thank you for your efforts, Lord Liu.

30
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:12,640
Your Highness flatters me.

31
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,960
I have only done my humble duty.

32
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:24,240
Reporting to Your Highness,

33
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,560
Commander Liu of the Imperial Guards has sent someone to see you.

34
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,880
Jiang Siyan acts quite quickly.

35
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,280
Let them in.

36
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,040
Yes.

37
00:03:35,880 --> 00:03:36,280
Please.

38
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:48,160
Reporting to Your Highness.

39
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,920
Her Highness the Princess came straight to the Imperial Guard camp upon returning to the capital.

40
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,840
It seems she intends to mobilize the troops.

41
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,640
Lord Liu specifically ordered me to report this.

42
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:56,480
The agreement between Lord Liu and Your Highness

43
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,720
has never been broken by him.

44
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:59,840
He is willing to pledge his life in loyalty to Your Highness.

45
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,760
He is not loyal to me.

46
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,840
He is loyal to his own interests.

47
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,520
Lord Liu and Your Highness are in the same boat.

48
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:12,840
If you gain,

49
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:14,240
he will not lose.

50
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,680
Since His Majesty already harbors murderous intent toward me,

51
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:25,160
I will not sit and wait for death.

52
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,600
Go back and tell your master

53
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,120
if Jiang Siyen makes any rash moves,

54
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,280
he will be executed on the spot.

55
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:32,560
Yes.

56
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:33,440
And one more thing.

57
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,400
If Lord Liu is willing to join me in this cause,

58
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:40,560
he will surely share in future glory.

59
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:42,800
If he refuses,

60
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:46,400
his misdeeds will be exposed to the world.

61
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,440
He will die with no place to be buried.

62
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:49,920
Yes, Your Highness.

63
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,120
Go.

64
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,200
Notify the palace guards.

65
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,360
The prince's residence is under lockdown from now on.

66
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,000
No one is allowed to enter or leave.

67
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:00,480
Yes, Your Highness.

68
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,440
The Book of Life and Death.

69
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:16,120
It's here.

70
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,680
Full lockdown.

71
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,960
No one is permitted to enter or leave.

72
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,080
Your Highness.

73
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:34,800
How are the preparations?

74
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,960
Everything is ready.

75
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,880
And the Kunlun Divine General.

76
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,120
Young Master Chu has arrived.

77
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:52,080
Divine General.

78
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,040
The Kunlun Divine General honors us with his presence.

79
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,080
I am currently being punished with confinement for reflection.

80
00:06:05,560 --> 00:06:07,000
I cannot go out to greet you.

81
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:14,720
Please forgive me.

82
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:17,880
To be granted an audience with Your Highness

83
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:19,760
is my honor.

84
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,000
I thought the Divine General wouldn't come to the capital.

85
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:24,520
Please.

86
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:38,600
May I ask what brings the Divine General here so suddenly?

87
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:40,560
Does Your Highness truly not know?

88
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:43,640
Could it be

89
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:47,000
that it is for my son's death

90
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:48,400
to seek retribution?

91
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,880
Just a joke.

92
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,640
The Divine General won't mind, will you?

93
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:06,480
I thought Your Highness would always hold a grudge because of this.

94
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:10,480
He was not careful enough in his actions.

95
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,200
He provoked someone like the Divine General, whom he should never have crossed.

96
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,720
He almost implicated me as well.

97
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,160
Such a foolish act

98
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,960
was truly self-destructive.

99
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:25,400
There's nothing to regret.

100
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:31,040
Is Your Highness truly so selfish and cold-blooded?

101
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,960
Selfish?

102
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:40,000
If one does not look out for oneself,

103
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,200
heaven and earth will destroy him.

104
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:45,960
Being selfish is better than being treated with indifference.

105
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:48,320
With the same father,

106
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:51,360
just because one's mother was of humble birth,

107
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:54,840
one suffers a lifetime of injustice for no reason.

108
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:01,560
Born as the illegitimate son of a great general

109
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,400
You must deeply understand the hardships and warmth of such a background.

110
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:09,600
What Your Highness means is

111
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,400
that because of your birth

112
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,880
you missed the chance to inherit the throne.

113
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,880
Before I turned sixteen,

114
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:24,320
I always thought, just like His Majesty,

115
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:27,560
that I was the legitimate son born of the late Empress.

116
00:08:27,560 --> 00:08:28,920
Of noble blood.

117
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,400
But one day, suddenly,

118
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,600
the late Emperor had me acknowledge my real mother.

119
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:37,880
She turned out to be a low-born, ordinary concubine.

120
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,080
Heaven is unjust.

121
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,000
Over these past years,

122
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,560
I have never acted out of line.

123
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:52,400
That is already the greatest kindness and tolerance I can show this world.

124
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,480
So what Your Highness means is

125
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:59,000
if you could ascend the throne,

126
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,120
you would surely surpass the current Emperor.

127
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:04,920
Isn't that obvious?

128
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,080
In rites, music, archery, charioteering, calligraphy, and mathematics,

129
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,160
as well as wisdom, courage, and military strategy,

130
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,200
in which aspect am I inferior to him?

131
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:14,240
Besides,

132
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:17,120
now all the civil and military officials in court

133
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,280
follow my every word and command.

134
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,160
How could my elder brother, who only talks about benevolence and the people's will,

135
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,040
possibly compare to me?

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:40,880
What are you laughing at?

137
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,480
It seems

138
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:46,920
the late emperor's decision

139
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,520
was the right one.

140
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,920
What do you mean by that, General?

141
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,920
Do you know,

142
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,320
when His Majesty returned to the palace, he spoke with me about you.

143
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:02,120
You don't know.

144
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,200
His Majesty gave me something.

145
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,160
Is it meant to be used against me?

146
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:12,800
My fate is not for you to decide.

147
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,640
Nor is it for him to decide.

148
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:19,080
Nothing can shake me in the slightest.

149
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:20,520
But what if

150
00:10:21,080 --> 00:10:22,400
this thing

151
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:26,040
might be related to your origins?

152
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,080
Is that so?
