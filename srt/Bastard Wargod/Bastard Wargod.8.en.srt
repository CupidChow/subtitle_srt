1
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,240
The princess decided her lifelong commitment with just a few words.

2
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,360
Why rush into this?

3
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:06,400
To avoid complications if we wait too long.

4
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:08,680
Of course, I must act first to gain the advantage.

5
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:13,800
Greetings, Your Highness.

6
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:19,880
Beichi.

7
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:21,520
You’ve finally returned.

8
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,760
Earlier, I was blind and deceived by petty people.

9
00:01:24,760 --> 00:01:26,120
I made you suffer injustice.

10
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,040
Once you officially marry the princess and become the prince consort,

11
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,200
you will surely lead the Chu family to great heights.

12
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:36,560
And bring honor to our family.

13
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,160
Didn’t you say a few days ago

14
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,560
that only Feng Yu could bring honor to the family?

15
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,200
Why is it me now?

16
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:51,240
I was confused before.

17
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:52,840
If you wish in the future,

18
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,160
the entire Chu family business can be entrusted to you.

19
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,560
If our ancestors are watching from above,

20
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,880
and see that the Chu family has produced such a capable child as you,

21
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:05,640
they would surely be pleased.

22
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:08,240
I’ll listen to Lord Chu.

23
00:02:08,480 --> 00:02:10,680
About Beichi setting fire to the ancestral hall a few days ago,

24
00:02:10,920 --> 00:02:12,480
you don’t seem to mind anymore.

25
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,040
It was all a misunderstanding.

26
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,200
A misunderstanding?

27
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,480
Chu Beichi.

28
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:21,240
You—

29
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:22,760
Let my son go!

30
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,440
How dare you!

31
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:28,880
Master

32
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,240
Are you just going to watch Feng Yu be thrown into prison?

33
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,240
And do nothing about it?

34
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:36,320
I want to help too.

35
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,880
But after all, it's the princess's decree.

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,120
Who would dare defy it?

37
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,560
Besides, Feng Yu is the successor of the Kunlun Divine General.

38
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,960
He surely won't just stand by and do nothing.

39
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:51,440
I just saw Madam.

40
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,160
It suddenly reminded me of something.

41
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:56,400
In these three years, the Chu family has collected quite a bit of gold and silver for Beichi.

42
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:58,400
We're about to get married.

43
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:00,440
Let's take out this money.

44
00:03:00,440 --> 00:03:01,720
Consider it the betrothal gift.

45
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:03,480
On the wedding day,

46
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,960
I want to distribute it throughout the city.

47
00:03:05,960 --> 00:03:06,760
So everyone can celebrate together.

48
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,520
No.

49
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,200
This is all the Chu family's money.

50
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,160
It can't be spent like this.

51
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,640
Master

52
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You must stand up for me.

53
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:29,280
Master

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,080
If you really agree to her request,

55
00:03:34,880 --> 00:03:37,400
I'll hang myself in this residence today.

56
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:38,680
Fine.

57
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:40,440
Since Madam likes it,

58
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:43,400
I see the trees in the Chu family's backyard are quite tall.

59
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,560
I'll have someone find one for you right away.

60
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,920
All the mistakes are my fault.

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:05,360
But Feng Yu is your own younger brother.

62
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,160
I beg you, for the sake of the past,

63
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:11,040
let the Princess release him.

64
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:12,240
Can you do that?

65
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:15,520
I never intended to put Feng Yu to death.

66
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,320
It's just that you've spoiled him so much, his ambitions are sky-high.

67
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:22,360
This is a good opportunity

68
00:04:22,360 --> 00:04:24,000
to temper his character a bit.

69
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:27,720
I think keeping him in prison

70
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,760
is actually good for him.

71
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,080
I'm tired.

72
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,440
I want to go back to my room and rest.

73
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,920
Chu Beichi.

74
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:00,960
You insist on marrying the Princess.

75
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,240
I refuse to let it happen.

76
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:10,160
The Empress wants to drug Commander Chu.

77
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:13,000
The dignified Empress of Beilie

78
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,760
would stoop to such a disgraceful act.

79
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,840
If Commander Chu is willing to marry the Princess, so be it.

80
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:19,280
But if the Empress wants to use drugs,

81
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,400
she must be stopped.

82
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,480
If she really does it,

83
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:25,080
I'll make sure the whole world knows about it.

84
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,800
Let's see how she can still hold her head up in Beilie.

85
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:28,880
Let's go.

86
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,600
Master.

87
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:32,240
Master.

88
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:33,960
What should we do about Feng Yu?

89
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:35,760
The Empress of Beilie has arrived.

90
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,640
I didn't know Your Majesty would grace us with your presence.

91
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:43,560
Enough with the small talk.

92
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:44,720
Where is Chu Beichi?

93
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:47,120
My son is resting in the other courtyard.

94
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,680
I'll have someone call him over right away.

95
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,400
No need.

96
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,680
I will go there myself.

97
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,080
Find someone to lead the way for me.

98
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,840
Alright.

99
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,560
Steward.

100
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:55,240
Lead the way.

101
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:55,840
Your Majesty.

102
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,200
Please follow me, Your Majesty.

103
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:07,040
The Empress of Beilie already wanted to marry Beichi at the gun ceremony earlier.

104
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,440
And now this...

105
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,480
Could it be she wants to compete with the Princess for the throne?

106
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:16,840
I'm just a scholar at the Imperial Academy.

107
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:19,200
But I have a remarkable son.

108
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,240
It's truly impressive.

109
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,440
Truly impressive.

110
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,440
Master.

111
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,560
What about that letter from Yu?

112
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,360
The bigger picture comes first.

113
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,320
Of course, it will have to wait for now.

114
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,760
This concerns the future of the Chu family.

115
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,200
If you mess this up,

116
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:35,320
I'll hold you solely responsible.

117
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:36,320
Mistress Jiu.

118
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,800
General Shen has arrived.

119
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,280
Why is someone else here again?

120
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,400
Is Young Master Chu at home?

121
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:43,240
He is.

122
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:44,080
No need to lead the way.

123
00:06:44,200 --> 00:06:45,000
Come with me.

124
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:50,920
Princess.

125
00:06:51,760 --> 00:06:52,760
Empress of Beilie.

126
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,600
There's also Mistress Jiu and General Shen.

127
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,000
Each of them is someone our Chu family could never hope to associate with.

128
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,120
Why do they all have their eyes on Beichi?

129
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,200
This way, Your Majesty.

130
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:24,240
Jiang Wuyou's visit is not simple.

131
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,360
She must be hiding ill intentions.

132
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,160
No matter what,

133
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,200
Your Highness, you must be careful.

134
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,200
General Shen.

135
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,000
Jiuniang.

136
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,280
Why are you here?

137
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:35,160
Beichi made it very clear.

138
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:35,880
He and I—

139
00:07:35,880 --> 00:07:36,280
No,

140
00:07:36,480 --> 00:07:37,320
that's not why we're here.

141
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:38,800
The Empress is planning to drug Commander Chu.

142
00:07:38,920 --> 00:07:39,720
Before she acts,

143
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:40,800
we must stop her.

144
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,840
What are you doing?

145
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,520
You are the Empress,

146
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:51,800
how can you stoop so low?

147
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:54,600
I know exactly what I'm doing.

148
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,040
Chu Beichi

149
00:07:56,640 --> 00:07:57,520
belongs to me.

150
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:58,080
You—

151
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,280
What's that smell?

152
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:16,000
Why is it a gas?

153
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,240
You—

154
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:23,760
What's in that bottle of yours

155
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:25,400
exactly?

156
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,440
This ylang-ylang scent—

157
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:30,840
I thought it would be put in the tea.

158
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:38,000
Liuli.

159
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,280
Liuli!

160
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,560
Princess!

161
00:08:40,920 --> 00:08:42,000
I'll go find Young Master Chu.

162
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:45,800
Young Master!

163
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,520
Young Master, something's wrong!

164
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:49,080
Her Highness and the others—

165
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,400
Her Highness and the others are in trouble!

166
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:25,800
Commander Chu

167
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:27,320
Beichi

168
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,760
I deserve a thousand deaths for my crime.

169
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,040
I just couldn't control my emotions for a moment.

170
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,840
I'll go kill all of them right now.

171
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,440
To protect Commander Chu's reputation.

172
00:09:58,840 --> 00:10:00,040
Come on, young master.

173
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,320
Respected teacher

174
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:04,120
Don't

175
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:09,280
The remaining poison in your bodies

176
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,520
I've already used my inner strength to force it all out for you.

177
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,200
Your Majesty

178
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:26,680
Why did you leave in such a hurry?

179
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:28,840
Jiu Niang

180
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:30,640
General Shen

181
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:35,800
Why does everyone look so worried?

182
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:41,840
Fortunately

183
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,760
at least one was saved.
