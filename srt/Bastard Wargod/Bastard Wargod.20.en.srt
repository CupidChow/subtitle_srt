1
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:56,880
Madam

2
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:58,200
Madam

3
00:00:58,360 --> 00:00:59,520
Madam, be careful

4
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Madam

5
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,200
Don't be afraid, son

6
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:03,280
Son

7
00:01:03,720 --> 00:01:04,280
Mother is here

8
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:05,120
Good boy

9
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,120
Don't be afraid

10
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,000
Don't be afraid, son

11
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,040
Mother is here

12
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:10,160
Good boy

13
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:16,640
Feng Yu

14
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:19,640
Feng Yu

15
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,400
Feng Yu

16
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:23,320
Feng Yu

17
00:01:24,920 --> 00:01:25,720
Feng Yu

18
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:28,200
Feng Yu

19
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:31,400
My son Feng Yu has returned.

20
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:35,160
My son Feng Yu is a great general.

21
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,440
He is the successor of the Kunlun Divine General.

22
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:39,760
That bastard Chu Beichi

23
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:42,360
can no longer compete with us mother and son.

24
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,200
Madam

25
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:45,240
Master

26
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,560
Feng Yu has returned.

27
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:47,640
Quick, take him away.

28
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:48,600
Yes, Master.

29
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,160
We have so much money.

30
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:51,800
Chu Beichi can't compare to you.

31
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:53,560
Child

32
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:55,440
You are the true hope of the Chu family.

33
00:01:55,760 --> 00:01:56,560
Father

34
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:57,880
What happened?

35
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,840
Ever since learning you are the Kunlun Divine General,

36
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:05,640
your uncle has been overly worried and fearful.

37
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,320
He fell ill and never recovered.

38
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,040
He doesn't have much time left.

39
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:14,560
Your second mother was so frightened she lost her senses.

40
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,760
She's become delirious.

41
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:19,040
It's all my fault.

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,160
I should have trusted you from the start.

43
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,960
I am ashamed to be the head of the family.

44
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,080
It was all because of my suspicion.

45
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,760
That's why things turned out this way.

46
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:36,760
Father

47
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:38,560
Take good care of your second mother.

48
00:02:41,080 --> 00:02:43,640
His Majesty has already allowed you to retire and return home.

49
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,480
Beichi

50
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,360
Siyan

51
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,000
I came here this time

52
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,520
just to ask when your wedding date is set.

53
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:44,360
There is still a hidden danger unresolved.

54
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:46,160
How can we talk about love and romance now?

55
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:51,520
Yes.

56
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,760
Now, Prince Qi is very powerful.

57
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,760
All I can do is order him to reflect behind closed doors.

58
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:01,200
Only by being with you

59
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:03,360
can Siyan ensure peace in Datian.

60
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,200
On behalf of Datian,

61
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:11,160
I beg the Divine General.

62
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,840
In the high halls of power,

63
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,280
there are unavoidable struggles for fame and gain.

64
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:25,880
And I have already witnessed

65
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:27,800
family turning against each other,

66
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:29,600
and kin harming kin.

67
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,600
In this life, I will never let Siyan face it alone.

68
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,640
I believe in Your Highness, the Princess.

69
00:04:37,760 --> 00:04:39,680
You will surely govern Datian well.

70
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,400
And I will stay by your side for life,

71
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,400
protecting you from behind.

72
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,120
There are rumors among the people that His Majesty has rarely attended court lately.

73
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,840
They say it's because his health has declined.

74
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:01,880
Some even speculate that His Majesty has already passed away.

75
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:04,840
And that a double is handling affairs in his place.

76
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:09,480
To think there are such absurd rumors.

77
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,400
Though the rumors are absurd,

78
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,840
all the people really want is to live in peace and prosperity.

79
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:17,280
To have no worries about food and clothing.

80
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:21,000
Yet most have never even seen the capital.

81
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:23,720
They have never seen their ruler in their entire lives.

82
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:27,480
All they want is a stable life.

83
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:28,600
And peace in the land.

84
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:30,560
So,

85
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,200
no matter who sits on the throne,

86
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:35,800
what difference does it make to them?

87
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,480
Even if I have such intentions,

88
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:41,240
there are still threats yet to be eliminated.

89
00:05:42,520 --> 00:05:45,120
I'm afraid the longer this drags on, the more unpredictable things become.

90
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,520
This person

91
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:52,800
must be eliminated.

92
00:05:54,480 --> 00:05:55,440
Si Yan.

93
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,160
Be extra careful when meeting Liu Wuzhou this time.

94
00:05:58,840 --> 00:05:59,720
Be very cautious.

95
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:01,360
You should be careful too.

96
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:03,280
I...

97
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,440
Is there anything else, Your Highness?

98
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,680
I know you've always wanted an ordinary life.

99
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,520
Are you truly willing, for my sake,

100
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,800
to return to court now?

101
00:06:22,480 --> 00:06:23,360
Those three years

102
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:25,600
What gave me the most peace of mind

103
00:06:26,320 --> 00:06:27,920
was hearing you speak by my ear

104
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,640
And the place where I find peace

105
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:32,240
is where I belong

106
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,720
Besides,

107
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:37,240
you are now my wife

108
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:42,720
Beichi,

109
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:44,560
if you are unwilling,

110
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:47,040
I can follow you

111
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,440
You know

112
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,920
I have never yearned for a life of splendor

113
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,720
Your ambition should be for all the people

114
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:01,080
You are destined to live for the common people

115
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,560
But I

116
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,000
after the world is at peace

117
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,640
I only wish to live for one person

118
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,000
Your Highness, the carriage is ready

119
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:33,280
Go ahead

120
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:11,800
Your Majesty,

121
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,320
In addition to my advice regarding Prince Qi,

122
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,760
I have another request.

123
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,520
My birth mother suffered a life of hardship.

124
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:19,920
She was also looked down upon by others.

125
00:08:20,320 --> 00:08:23,120
I wish to ask Your Majesty to restore her rightful status.

126
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,840
So that her spirit may be at peace.

127
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:27,520
I now present her origins and life story

128
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,880
to Your Majesty.

129
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,200
Chu Gao

130
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:34,280
Her given name was Gao Junyi.

131
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:37,520
Gao Junyi.

132
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:39,400
The Noble Consort.

133
00:08:39,560 --> 00:08:40,640
The Noble Consort suffered a hemorrhage.

134
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,480
She has already passed away.

135
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,320
Attendants! Yes, Your Majesty.

136
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,880
Drag out those who attended the Noble Consort's childbirth and execute them.

137
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:49,920
My beloved consort,

138
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:51,880
My beloved consort,

139
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,840
I have wronged you.

140
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,760
Your Majesty,

141
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,160
I know that Prince Qi has conspired with the ministers

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:09,840
and forced you to choose the child over the mother.

143
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:13,280
I also know Your Majesty could not bear it.

144
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:16,200
And that my family would be implicated.

145
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:19,840
So I have chosen to end my life by poison.

146
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,360
To relieve Your Majesty of this burden.

147
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,920
But I know very well

148
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:28,080
that Prince Qi and his faction will not stop here.

149
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,680
To protect our son from their harm,

150
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,360
I have entrusted him to the maid who gave birth to a daughter the other day.

151
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:39,040
Gao Junyi.

152
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:41,800
She will bring her daughter into the palace.

153
00:09:47,080 --> 00:09:49,400
Your Majesty, the child born is a princess.

154
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:52,080
If I had known I would give birth to a princess,

155
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,000
the faction of Prince Qi would not have pressed so hard.

156
00:09:56,680 --> 00:10:00,080
Both children could have grown up safely.

157
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,920
I only beg Your Majesty not to bring my son back to the palace.

158
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,600
I only wish for him to live a safe and complete life.

159
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:09,520
To live as an ordinary person.

160
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Then I could die in peace.

161
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,120
This is my final letter.

162
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,920
Chu Beichi

163
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,040
He is actually my own flesh and blood.

164
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:48,200
Miss

165
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:53,440
Come, come, come.

166
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,160
This child is really pitiful.

167
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,160
Miss

168
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,480
There, there.
