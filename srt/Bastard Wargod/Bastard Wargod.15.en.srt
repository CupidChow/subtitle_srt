1
00:00:58,240 --> 00:01:02,240
Long live Your Majesty! Long live! Long, long live!

2
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:09,040
Insolent traitor!

3
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,360
Why do you not kneel before His Majesty?

4
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,200
You may all rise.

5
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,680
Thank you, Your Majesty.

6
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,360
Your Majesty.

7
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:30,360
I was just about to finish interrogating this traitor,

8
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,160
and then come to see you.

9
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:33,920
Why has Your Majesty come in person?

10
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,920
I was in the palace,

11
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,920
and it was truly boring.

12
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:41,160
There's nothing special about this Binzhou place.

13
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,760
I just wanted to join in the excitement.

14
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,280
Siyan, aren't you handling the case?

15
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,560
Why do I see you all

16
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:50,720
brandishing swords and weapons?

17
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,520
Reporting to Father, Your Majesty,

18
00:01:58,480 --> 00:02:00,680
Chu Beichi has committed heinous crimes.

19
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,520
He has repeatedly shown discontent toward the court and the royal family.

20
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,440
These are testimonies from his relatives.

21
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,760
All have signed and sealed them.

22
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:12,480
Please review them, Your Majesty.

23
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,280
Your Majesty.

24
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:28,360
It is clear that this Chu Beichi

25
00:02:28,960 --> 00:02:30,480
is a born rebel.

26
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:32,360
Even his own family cannot tolerate him.

27
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,440
Such a disloyal and unfilial person

28
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,280
dared to kill the heir in public.

29
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:39,040
He has no regard for the law.

30
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,960
Your Majesty.

31
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,760
I, your subject's wife, request your decree.

32
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,560
to immediately execute the traitor Chu Beichi.

33
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:56,400
Minister Chu

34
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:59,480
You are honored as the Grand Academician.

35
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:00,840
You are knowledgeable about both ancient and modern matters.

36
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:02,040
You are well-read and reasonable.

37
00:03:03,160 --> 00:03:08,360
Could you really have taught such a traitor?

38
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,560
Your Majesty, I... I...

39
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,920
Your Majesty,

40
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,760
I am only letting this go for General Chu's sake.

41
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,640
Otherwise, I would not spare the Chu family.

42
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:22,200
But as for Chu Beichi,

43
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:25,000
he must be executed.

44
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:31,560
Father, you must not harm a loyal man so easily.

45
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,120
It would chill the hearts of the people.

46
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,760
Chu Beichi killed a royal without permission.

47
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,160
That is a capital offense.

48
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,160
Royal kinship is not a free pass from punishment.

49
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:40,480
Why is Royal Uncle so anxious?

50
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,960
Is it due to personal resentment,

51
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,880
or do you have another motive?

52
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,440
Princess, what do you mean by this?

53
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,320
Enough, enough.

54
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:50,520
Stop arguing, all of you.

55
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:52,960
You're giving me a headache.

56
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:55,040
If I had known it would be like this,

57
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,560
I wouldn't have come at all.

58
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:01,120
This is all your fault.

59
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,480
What do you have to say for yourself now?

60
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:08,600
Your Majesty,

61
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:11,600
If you must kill me, so be it.

62
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:17,040
But before that,

63
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:19,280
I ask Your Majesty to make a public announcement to the nation

64
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,800
to clear the name of the Xuanjia Army.

65
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,120
To prevent

66
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:25,320
those with ulterior motives

67
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:27,560
from sowing discord among the troops.

68
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,280
Chu Beichi,

69
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:31,240
this is a matter of great importance to the court.

70
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,480
It is not your place to speak further here.

71
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:35,960
Father,

72
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:39,200
clearing the name of the Xuanjia Army is no trivial matter.

73
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:40,960
For every moment we delay,

74
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,520
the soldiers and their families grow more anxious and disheartened.

75
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,920
Please, Father, clear the name of the Xuanjia Army as soon as possible

76
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,920
to reassure the people.

77
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,880
Between my own life and the morale of the Xuanjia soldiers,

78
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,480
which is more important?

79
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,600
Your Majesty should know the answer.

80
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:03,240
Does the Prince not understand?

81
00:05:06,680 --> 00:05:08,320
Your Majesty, please make a decision.

82
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,440
Father, please make a decision.

83
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,080
That does make sense.

84
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:16,000
The morale of the troops must not be shaken.

85
00:05:16,040 --> 00:05:18,080
Quickly, deliver my decree.

86
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,560
Post the imperial notice at the soldiers' places of residence.

87
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,320
Clear the name of the Xuanjia Army.

88
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,200
If anyone accuses them of desertion again,

89
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,560
it will be considered treason.

90
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:34,960
Your Majesty.

91
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,960
Since there is already an imperial decree regarding the false desertion charges,

92
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,320
then regarding Chu Beichi killing the heir,

93
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:46,200
I ask Your Majesty to make a final judgment.

94
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:47,520
What?

95
00:05:48,080 --> 00:05:49,600
A final judgment?

96
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:56,720
Only the Kunlun Divine General has the right to make a final judgment.

97
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,960
Other than that,

98
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,720
who else is qualified to judge the crimes of the Xuanjia Army?

99
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:03,440
Younger brother.

100
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:04,760
Your Majesty.

101
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,640
My son Feng Yu is highly valued by the Kunlun Divine General.

102
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,360
He has also received his personal teachings.

103
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,720
I, your humble servant, dare to suggest

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,200
that my son Feng Yu can make the decision on his behalf.

105
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,720
Can you really make the decision for him?

106
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:23,200
Your Majesty,

107
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:25,320
the Divine General has taught me for many years

108
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:26,800
so that I may serve the country with utmost loyalty.

109
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:28,960
It's just a pity

110
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,760
that I was momentarily careless

111
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,280
and allowed the young prince

112
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:34,840
to be harmed by the traitor Chu Beichi.

113
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,000
Thanks to the prince for not abandoning me

114
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:40,080
and giving me a chance to atone for my crime through merit.

115
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,640
I earnestly request Your Majesty to issue an order

116
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,080
allowing me to personally execute Chu Beichi

117
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,480
to show my loyalty.

118
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:48,760
What?

119
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,160
You want to personally behead your own brother?

120
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:57,800
From the moment he became a traitor,

121
00:06:58,840 --> 00:06:59,720
he and I

122
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:02,480
were no longer brothers.

123
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,840
Killing him is ridding the people of a menace.

124
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:07,680
It is my duty; I cannot refuse.

125
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,120
General Chu, you are truly righteous.

126
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,080
No wonder the Divine General of Kunlun petitioned me several times three years ago

127
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,160
to reward you and your Chu family.

128
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:21,160
Coincidentally, I have here a memorial from three years ago

129
00:07:21,160 --> 00:07:24,800
personally written by the Divine General, requesting a reward for General Chu.

130
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:41,560
With such a reward from Your Majesty,

131
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:43,640
I truly cannot accept any more.

132
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:45,560
If Your Majesty insists on rewarding,

133
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,320
then please grant the position of Grand Dragon Cavalry General of Datian

134
00:07:49,040 --> 00:07:51,360
to my younger brother, Chu Fengyu.

135
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:58,840
The Divine General recommended me for the position of Grand Dragon Cavalry General,

136
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:08,480
but my younger brother,

137
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:10,520
Chu Fengyu,

138
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,040
what is going on?

139
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:18,880
My younger brother,

140
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:20,800
the essence of being a general

141
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:23,520
is to distinguish right from wrong and protect the common people.

142
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,520
To win without killing,

143
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:27,640
and bring peace to the world.

144
00:08:28,280 --> 00:08:31,720
Do you still remember what I said?

145
00:08:33,160 --> 00:08:33,960
How could you...

146
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:42,320
The Kunlun General referred to him as "my brother" in his memorial.

147
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:44,000
Then doesn't that mean he is...

148
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,040
Where does all the glory of your Chu family truly come from?

149
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:53,280
Now you should understand, shouldn't you?

150
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:56,840
Beichi

151
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:57,600
Could it be that you are...

152
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,160
Impossible.

153
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:00,840
This child could not possibly be the Kunlun General.

154
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,480
But the letter clearly says...

155
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:03,840
He's just a concubine's son.

156
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:05,160
How could he be the Kunlun General?

157
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:09,000
The General must have held my son in extremely high regard.

158
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,480
That's why he called him "brother."

159
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:12,320
It seems...

160
00:09:12,520 --> 00:09:15,360
My son and the General truly were both mentor and friend to each other.

161
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,760
Their bond was indeed deep.

162
00:09:24,760 --> 00:09:26,560
It does seem to be the case.

163
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,840
General Chu and the Kunlun General have a close relationship.

164
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,000
Your Majesty.

165
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:35,760
My brother truly did not misjudge him.

166
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,800
Prince Qi.

167
00:09:38,360 --> 00:09:41,880
As if you’re the only perceptive person in the world.

168
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,400
Why do you say that, Your Majesty?

169
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:55,200
Do you really think I don't know the Kunlun General?

170
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:01,320
The Kunlun General is...

171
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,080
Your Majesty.

172
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:08,520
Something terrible has happened!

173
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:10,480
The Kunlun General has raised an army in rebellion!
