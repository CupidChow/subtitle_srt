1
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,000
I didn't know Lady Jiu was gracing us with her presence.

2
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,640
Sorry for not welcoming you from afar.

3
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:04,720
Sorry for not welcoming you from afar.

4
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:08,640
Lady Jiu.

5
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:10,920
You even dare to mess with the imperial soldiers?

6
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,680
Are you tired of living?

7
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,560
It's a misunderstanding.

8
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:16,160
I'm sure this is just a misunderstanding.

9
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:17,840
Lady Jiu is straightforward by nature.

10
00:01:18,440 --> 00:01:20,560
I think something must have gone wrong.

11
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,080
Yes, yes.

12
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,120
Straightforward by nature.

13
00:01:23,120 --> 00:01:24,400
Does that mean you can do whatever you want?

14
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:27,520
All these years, my Chu family has treated you well.

15
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,840
Today, you must give me an explanation.

16
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:31,480
Feng Yu.

17
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,360
Lady Jiu is very powerful.

18
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,280
She has always looked after the Chu family.

19
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,800
If we offend her,

20
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:39,080
we can't afford the consequences.

21
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,120
Especially with the business your uncle and I have outside.

22
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:46,720
Forget it.

23
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,640
I won't argue with a woman.

24
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:52,480
Lady Jiu.

25
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:56,320
Just now, Young Master Chu shamelessly insisted on seeing you.

26
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:00,440
Why don't you ask him what important matter he has?

27
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,160
This...

28
00:02:10,240 --> 00:02:11,360
What?

29
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,240
You hurt my subordinate.

30
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:23,640
If you want to apologize, you should kneel to me.

31
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,040
That's right, the famous General Chu of the northern frontier is still standing here.

32
00:02:27,320 --> 00:02:29,000
It seems Jiuniang knelt to the wrong person.

33
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:30,320
Yes, she knelt to the wrong person.

34
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,920
You didn't want to reveal your identity.

35
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,720
It's been three years.

36
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:36,280
Jiuniang could only wait for you in silence.

37
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:38,640
Jiuniang.

38
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:42,440
I'm entrusting these businesses and properties to you.

39
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:44,440
Thank you, sir.

40
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:48,000
You made it so I'm no longer a helpless widow.

41
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,640
From now on, I will hide my true self behind a facade.

42
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:53,600
And gather intelligence from all over the world.

43
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,160
To serve the country loyally.

44
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,200
When you return,

45
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,680
I will repay you properly.

46
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:08,320
Get up, you've worked hard all these years.

47
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:10,800
They were able to deceive me for so many years.

48
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,640
That was Jiuniang's oversight.

49
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:16,000
All of you, kneel before me!

50
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,080
My wealth has always come from your generosity.

51
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:25,120
Since you treated him so harshly today,

52
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,200
I will withdraw all cooperation with the Chu family

53
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:29,720
and the three great families.

54
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:31,160
What? What?

55
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:34,320
What identity has this useless Chu Beichi been hiding?

56
00:03:34,320 --> 00:03:35,120
Exactly.

57
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,320
Bluffing.

58
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,200
With me here,

59
00:03:42,520 --> 00:03:43,840
there's no need for any of you to fear her.

60
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:48,600
With General Chu backing us,

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,480
and our financial resources,

62
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,960
what can you possibly do to us?

63
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,880
How ridiculous.

64
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:57,400
With your limited abilities,

65
00:03:57,840 --> 00:03:59,560
you still dream of challenging me?

66
00:03:59,720 --> 00:04:03,480
Perhaps the three great families can't match you,

67
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:06,160
but Lord Chu holds great power and status.

68
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,120
This General Chu

69
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,680
was personally appointed by the Emperor as the Grand General of Zhenyuan.

70
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:11,800
Even he can't deal with you?

71
00:04:14,240 --> 00:04:17,440
Do you know who my mentor is?

72
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,560
The Divine General of Kunlun.

73
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:19,720
I know that.

74
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:21,320
The whole city knows.

75
00:04:21,320 --> 00:04:23,120
Who doesn't know that?

76
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:25,160
I've achieved great military feats.

77
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,320
Soon, I'll inherit his legacy.

78
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,880
By then, even you will have to kneel before me.

79
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:33,560
You still dare to mention the Divine General of Kunlun?

80
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,920
The General and I are both mentor and friend.

81
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:36,960
We share a deep bond.

82
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:40,080
Even his female lieutenant, Shen Feixue,

83
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,720
calls me her brother.

84
00:04:41,920 --> 00:04:43,520
She treats me with utmost respect.

85
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:46,680
You really are foolish.

86
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,200
Have you truly met the Divine General?

87
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,880
Back when you were defeated at the border,

88
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,560
why did the enemy retreat at the last moment?

89
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,040
Feixue must have told you in the north,

90
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,120
she's been waiting for someone.

91
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,680
Aren't you curious?

92
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:13,760
So what?

93
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:17,600
Are you trying to say you're the Divine General of Kunlun?

94
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:19,000
What a joke.

95
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:24,000
I think lying at home for three years has made you lose your mind.

96
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:29,160
Feng Yu

97
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,480
I shouldn't have given you any chance.

98
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,840
Today, I'll kill every last one of you.

99
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:35,000
To atone for your disrespect toward the young master.

100
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:35,640
Feng Yu

101
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:37,600
Jiu Niang, how dare you!

102
00:05:39,200 --> 00:05:40,320
What a disgrace to our family.

103
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:42,040
What a disgrace to our family.

104
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,840
I, Chu Hong,

105
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,480
how did I raise such a rebellious and unfilial child?

106
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:49,560
Aren't you going to tell them to stop?

107
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,480
Young master.

108
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,120
Stop wasting words with them.

109
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,040
Let's go.

110
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,360
They'll soon realize

111
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:57,840
what they've truly lost.

112
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:00,560
Enough.

113
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:04,800
Let's go.

114
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:23,400
Feng Yu

115
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:23,960
Master.

116
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,280
Master, something's wrong!

117
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:27,520
The managers of over forty shops under the Chu family

118
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:29,160
have all suddenly left together.

119
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:31,320
All the servants in the shops have run away too.

120
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,200
Besides that,

121
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:34,280
many suppliers have suddenly come to confront us.

122
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:37,760
They say they'll never supply goods to the Chu family or the three main families again.

123
00:06:38,200 --> 00:06:39,200
It's over.

124
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:39,840
Master.

125
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,560
It's all over.

126
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,240
Master.

127
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:42,320
It must be Jiu Niang.

128
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,080
Master.

129
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:43,720
What should we do now?

130
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,800
Brother-in-law, brother-in-law!

131
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:51,280
Chu Beichi is such a useless fool.

132
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,000
All he can do is hide behind women.

133
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:57,400
Once Sister Feixue arrives in Binzhou,

134
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,360
I'll settle the score then.

135
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:08,960
In recent years, Binzhou has enjoyed peace and order.

136
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,120
There have been no more bandit troubles.

137
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:13,080
This is all thanks to General Chu's great reputation.

138
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:15,600
General Chu,

139
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,520
I offer you a toast.

140
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,480
General Chu's military strategy is exceptional.

141
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,600
Unlike people like Chu Beichi, who only seek fame.

142
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:29,160
General Chu has defended the northern border for many years.

143
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:30,640
Now that the True God has returned to his place,

144
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:33,520
we can finally rest easy.

145
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:36,840
Although I have achieved some military merit,

146
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,080
and received guidance from the Divine General,

147
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:39,840
with such praise from all of you,

148
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,560
I feel unworthy of it.

149
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:44,160
Tomorrow, the Divine General will personally come to Binzhou

150
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:45,480
to hold a weapon-bestowing ceremony for me.

151
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,920
I hope you will all honor me with your presence.

152
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:49,480
and attend together.

153
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,040
Tomorrow, we will witness General Chu inherit the title of Kunlun Divine General.

154
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,880
It is an honor for all of us.

155
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,160
Father.

156
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:03,880
Everything I have achieved today,

157
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:05,280
is thanks to your guidance.

158
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,920
When I become the Kunlun Divine General in the future,

159
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:09,600
I will surely bring great honor to the Chu family.

160
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:10,840
And ensure our family's prosperity for generations.

161
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:11,560
Good.

162
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,440
Very good.

163
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:13,960
My son, Feng Yu,

164
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:15,360
will surely achieve greatness.

165
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,400
Everyone, rest assured.

166
00:08:18,880 --> 00:08:20,600
If Feng Yu can lift the Kunlun Divine Spear,

167
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,280
he can protect the peace of Binzhou.

168
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:23,920
As long as I am here,

169
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,360
there will be no more evildoers in the future

170
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:27,960
who dare to threaten even an inch of Binzhou or our land.

171
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:29,440
With General Chu here,

172
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:31,600
I am completely at ease.

173
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,200
Run!

174
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,760
The Blood Bandits are coming!

175
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:36,680
Help!

176
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:38,480
Run, the Blood Bandits are coming! Run!

177
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,320
Blood Bandits!

178
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,080
Blood Bandits!

179
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:43,480
What should we do?

180
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:45,080
What should we do?

181
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:04,400
Move aside!

182
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,560
Is your leg alright?

183
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,920
Of course, it's fine.

184
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,000
Sometimes, sitting down

185
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:31,840
lets you see a person's true nature more clearly.

186
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,640
I never expected

187
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:36,440
that you are my true family.

188
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:48,320
Only as family?

189
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,200
There should be a limit to jokes.

190
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:00,720
I'm not joking.

191
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,040
Well?

192
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:11,960
Young master.

193
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:21,040
Young Master Chu

194
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,360
It's time to take your medicine.

195
00:10:23,960 --> 00:10:26,240
It's just an ordinary tonic.

196
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,120
Young Master Chu is just recovering now.

197
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:33,720
This is the time when you need a regular tonic to recuperate.

198
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:38,120
Here, Young Master Chu.

199
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:42,920
Young Master.

200
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:45,240
Wipe your mouth.

201
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,880
Alright.

202
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:51,120
Here you go, Young Master.

203
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,240
Have another sip.

204
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:02,440
Slaughter everyone in Binzhou.

205
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,120
Slaughter everyone in Binzhou.

206
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,560
Slaughter everyone in Binzhou.

207
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:11,040
Slaughter everyone in Binzhou.
