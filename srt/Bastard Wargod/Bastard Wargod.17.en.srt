1
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,920
Your Majesty, what are your orders?

2
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:04,160
The Da Tian nation

3
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,720
is entrusted to you at this moment.

4
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:11,720
Your Majesty need not worry.

5
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:14,520
Impostors will eventually reveal their flaws.

6
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,640
I will resolve this matter as soon as possible.

7
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:18,880
Of course I believe you.

8
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,000
With your abilities as the Divine General, you will surely turn danger into safety.

9
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:26,000
But what I want to say right now is

10
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,280
this Da Tian kingdom needs an heir.

11
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:34,400
I have long had this intention.

12
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,400
Back then, I agreed to let the princess take care of you

13
00:01:38,760 --> 00:01:40,960
because I wanted to bring you two together.

14
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:43,480
Now you have become the prince consort.

15
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,320
So I can entrust this kingdom to you.

16
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,440
Your Majesty,

17
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,320
as a general,

18
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,600
all I seek is to quell the rebels and bring peace to the land.

19
00:01:57,240 --> 00:01:58,960
All I wish for is peace under heaven.

20
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,360
If the Divine General of Kunlun is no longer here,

21
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,160
that will be the time when the seas are calm and the rivers are peaceful.

22
00:02:07,160 --> 00:02:08,640
All Si Yan and I wish for

23
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:10,520
is to live as an ordinary couple.

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,480
I truly find it hard to believe

25
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,760
that there are people in this world who do not wish to be emperor.

26
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:24,320
Your Majesty, as the Son of Heaven,

27
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,280
if you were given another chance to choose,

28
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,080
would you still choose to sit on the dragon throne?

29
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,920
Shouldering the heavy responsibility of the nation

30
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,880
Imprisoned by the cage of rules

31
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,320
For the sake of checks and balances

32
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,600
Even having to give up the one I love

33
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,360
This is not what I wish for

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:51,360
Yes

35
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:58,720
To this day, Siyen is still troubled by her mother's death

36
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,800
Back then, I blame myself for hesitating

37
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,120
I failed to stop the suggestion to save the child and abandon the mother in time

38
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:13,640
So she took her own life during childbirth

39
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,240
Your Majesty did not expect this

40
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,560
The noble consort's sacrifice did not bring a crown prince

41
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:24,880
But a princess

42
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,560
So Your Majesty became disheartened

43
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,720
And withdrew from public life

44
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,760
On the surface, not concerning yourself with worldly affairs

45
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:34,240
But secretly using this to protect yourself

46
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:35,800
And to ensure the princess's safety

47
00:03:36,520 --> 00:03:37,320
Yes

48
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:40,040
Precisely because of this

49
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:43,320
I have always kept in secret contact with you

50
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,520
I know you are the true pillar of this realm

51
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,440
Siyen is no less than any man

52
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,480
She and I have come to know and understand each other

53
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,480
We are in love with each other

54
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,800
If one day she is willing

55
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:59,280
I am willing to accompany her to the very top

56
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,360
Even so

57
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:06,600
If a woman were to rule the country

58
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:08,920
It would surely cause controversy

59
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,360
If a divine general like you stands by her side

60
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:15,200
Supporting and stabilizing the court

61
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,000
It will surely

62
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:18,680
Make all under heaven submit

63
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:22,560
Siyen cannot be without you

64
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,600
As long as she is willing

65
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:28,000
I am willing to stay by her side forever

66
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
A young woman without status or title,

67
00:04:49,480 --> 00:04:51,120
protecting a man so fiercely—

68
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:52,480
aren't you ashamed?

69
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:55,960
For these three years, I have devoted myself to treating you.

70
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:57,760
I have never slacked off, not even a little.

71
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:00,480
If you are willing,

72
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,480
I wish to spend the rest of my life with you.

73
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:08,400
Of course I am willing.

74
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:11,760
I have been alone since childhood.

75
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,080
Because of you,

76
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,040
I have hoped every day for the past three years that you would wake up.

77
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,200
You are my only hope.

78
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,200
I am fortunate

79
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:34,560
to have found a son-in-law like you.

80
00:06:11,160 --> 00:06:12,120
General Chu

81
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:15,000
When will the various troops arrive?

82
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:16,440
Your Highness,

83
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:19,880
the reinforcements will begin arriving in Binzhou tomorrow.

84
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,600
Very good.

85
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:25,520
Even without the imperial token to mobilize troops,

86
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,000
they have no choice but to obey me.

87
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:33,320
But there has been no word from His Majesty for days.

88
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:34,600
I am concerned.

89
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,760
No need to worry.

90
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,600
I will handle it myself.

91
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,320
But—

92
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,640
When all the troops have arrived,

93
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:45,840
you will command the army on my behalf.

94
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:48,640
Thank you, Your Highness.

95
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:49,640
I will not fail you.

96
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:52,880
General Chu,

97
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,080
if one day you must face the Divine General of Kunlun as an enemy,

98
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,880
do you dare to fight?

99
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:10,200
Your Highness is loyal to our Datian.

100
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:11,680
To oppose you

101
00:07:11,800 --> 00:07:13,320
would be to oppose all of Datian.

102
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:14,320
Of course,

103
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,800
that would also make them my enemy.

104
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:18,600
No matter who the opponent is,

105
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:19,880
I will not show mercy.

106
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,240
With such resolve, General Chu,

107
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,680
I will not let you down.

108
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:35,440
I take my leave.

109
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,440
Have you found out where my useless royal brother is?

110
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,640
Very good.

111
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:55,120
Then you know what to do.

112
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,240
You've already failed once.

113
00:07:57,720 --> 00:07:59,840
This time, there must be no mistakes.

114
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:01,560
Yes, sir.

115
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:06,240
Kill.

116
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:07,760
If you don't hand over the dog emperor,

117
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,400
the Xuanjia Army will slaughter everyone in Binzhou City.

118
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,760
Do you think our city can hold out?

119
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,120
I don't know.

120
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,800
I heard that the Kunlun Divine General sweeps through all lands.

121
00:08:19,920 --> 00:08:20,880
His power shakes the entire realm.

122
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,560
And the Xuanjia Army is even more unstoppable.

123
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:24,840
If they break in,

124
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:26,440
we'll all be wiped out.

125
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:27,480
Yeah.

126
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,760
The emperor just had to hide at a time like this.

127
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,960
He doesn't care if the people live or die.

128
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:32,920
But Prince Qi guards us day and night.

129
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:33,960
He's someone we can rely on.

130
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,480
Exactly.

131
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:35,040
How dare you!

132
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:37,280
General.

133
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:39,400
How dare you discuss court affairs so recklessly!

134
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:42,560
Remember,

135
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,680
when the main army arrives,

136
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,480
I will command all military operations.

137
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:48,440
Everyone must follow Prince Qi's orders.

138
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:49,200
Yes, sir.

139
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,400
With the emperor gone,

140
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,840
Prince Qi holds the military power.

141
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:56,880
Isn't that the same as being the emperor?

142
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,560
General, look!

143
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,120
Reinforcements have arrived!

144
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,680
Double cannons, seize the flag!

145
00:09:28,280 --> 00:09:30,440
Even without the imperial tally,

146
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,640
I can still...

147
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:36,920
Seize military power

148
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:43,080
Why is there only one person?

149
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:43,880
Yeah

150
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,920
Chu Beichi
