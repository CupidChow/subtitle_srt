1
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,200
Young Master

2
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:04,000
As expected, he's one of King Qi's men.

3
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:34,800
Chu Beichi has escaped from prison and is on the run.

4
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:36,040
Search the entire city immediately.

5
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:37,440
Once found,

6
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:38,560
kill without mercy.

7
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:39,440
Yes.

8
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:01,600
Sleep.

9
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,440
Enjoy it.

10
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:07,240
This is your last night in the world.

11
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,840
Your Highness, Prince Qi

12
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:20,800
The young prince has passed away.

13
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:23,200
I am also deeply grieved.

14
00:02:23,560 --> 00:02:24,360
I never expected

15
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:26,400
that rebellious son Chu Beichi

16
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:28,600
would dare to act so outrageously.

17
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,760
It was my failure in discipline.

18
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:33,240
I deserve to die a thousand times for my crime.

19
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:34,400
Your Highness

20
00:02:34,520 --> 00:02:36,800
Chu Beichi was expelled from the Chu family long ago.

21
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,480
His name has already been removed from the family register.

22
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:40,680
He has no further ties to our Chu family.

23
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,880
I hope Your Highness will see this clearly.

24
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:46,400
General Chu has already explained this matter to me.

25
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:49,880
I do not intend to vent my anger on your Chu family.

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,200
You may all rise.

27
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:56,400
Thank you, Your Highness.

28
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,200
However,

29
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:03,720
Chu Beichi has committed a grave act of treason.

30
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,600
He dared to kill the heir apparent in public.

31
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:07,800
This man

32
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:10,560
must have harbored rebellious intentions for some time.

33
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,280
As his close relatives,

34
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:15,160
how could you not have noticed?

35
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,400
Your Highness,

36
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,920
Chu Beichi has always been gentle and respectful at home.

37
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,080
He has never overstepped any bounds.

38
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:26,200
Master

39
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:31,320
This case is of great importance.

40
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,280
His Majesty will personally preside over the trial.

41
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,640
Since you are Chu Beichi's relatives,

42
00:03:38,520 --> 00:03:40,080
your testimony is extremely important.

43
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:43,520
I must also present it to His Majesty for review.

44
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,480
Only then can Chu Beichi be convicted.

45
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,080
Bring in Chu Beichi.

46
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:14,800
Your Highness

47
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:22,640
Kneel.

48
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:33,960
Chu Beichi

49
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,240
You are very bold.

50
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:38,280
You killed the heir without cause.

51
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,600
You have shown contempt for the royal family.

52
00:04:40,640 --> 00:04:41,880
This is an act of treason.

53
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,400
At this point,

54
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:45,440
do you still refuse to confess?

55
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:48,760
I killed your son.

56
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:50,040
You can hold me accountable for my crime.

57
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:51,480
But

58
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:53,560
your son harmed many people.

59
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:55,880
Who will hold him accountable for his crimes?

60
00:04:57,720 --> 00:04:59,120
You still dare to argue?

61
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,320
Whether my son is guilty has yet to be determined.

62
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,240
But your crimes are heinous.

63
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:07,720
And there are witnesses.

64
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:10,560
My lord,

65
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:13,240
Chu Beichi has been stubborn and unteachable since childhood.

66
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,680
He has no sense of respect or propriety.

67
00:05:15,200 --> 00:05:18,240
That he would now defy imperial authority

68
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,480
is hardly surprising.

69
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:21,520
That's absolutely right.

70
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:24,280
Chu Beichi was born to a lowly woman.

71
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:26,160
Later, the master brought him back to the manor to raise him.

72
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,600
Even though we treated him as our own,

73
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:31,000
he was still ungrateful.

74
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,120
His nature is hard to change.

75
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:34,160
He only ever took from the Chu family.

76
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,760
He never gave anything in return.

77
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:37,680
He is truly cold and heartless.

78
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:39,240
After he woke up,

79
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:40,360
he became even more unruly.

80
00:05:40,360 --> 00:05:41,320
He insulted his elders,

81
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,560
defied filial piety,

82
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:45,760
and spoke disrespectfully of the imperial throne.

83
00:05:46,040 --> 00:05:47,960
We discovered he harbored treasonous intentions.

84
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,000
We wanted to punish him,

85
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,840
but he oppressed us instead.

86
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,520
So it seems,

87
00:05:54,760 --> 00:05:58,520
Chu Beichi, you have long been dissatisfied with the royal family.

88
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,560
That's why you killed the heir in public without reason.

89
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,280
Brother-in-law

90
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,880
Chu Beichi is doomed this time.

91
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,560
He’s caused such a huge disaster.

92
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,320
No one can save him now.

93
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,320
Master, it’s fortunate that the Prince is magnanimous.

94
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,480
He’s not holding it against the Chu family.

95
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:35,080
Shouldn’t we seize this chance to show the Chu family’s loyalty?

96
00:06:35,720 --> 00:06:36,760
Master, don’t forget,

97
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:38,560
we still have Feng Yu.

98
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,360
That’s true.

99
00:07:12,040 --> 00:07:14,240
The Prince just wants to announce to the world

100
00:07:14,600 --> 00:07:17,480
that I, Chu Beichi, am disloyal and unfilial.

101
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,240
I killed the heir

102
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,560
because I was dissatisfied with the court.

103
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,000
In this way,

104
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:30,160
he can cover up all the crimes the heir committed.

105
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,120
Chu Beichi

106
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:35,400
You are a smart person,

107
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,960
yet you did such a foolish thing.

108
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:40,760
Your death is not to be regretted.

109
00:07:41,320 --> 00:07:45,040
Today, I will have you buried with Wuyou.

110
00:07:45,160 --> 00:07:45,800
Wait.

111
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:01,280
Siyan

112
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:10,040
Royal Uncle

113
00:08:10,880 --> 00:08:11,880
No need for formalities.

114
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:16,560
His Majesty has entrusted me to handle this matter first.

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,840
I wonder why the Princess Royal is here.

116
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,080
For what reason?

117
00:08:22,200 --> 00:08:23,480
Royal Uncle, you misunderstand.

118
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:26,800
I am not here to interfere with your trial.

119
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,600
If that’s the case,

120
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:31,920
please rest to the side, Princess Royal.

121
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:34,600
Since this is a trial,

122
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:37,440
all witnesses and evidence must be present.

123
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:41,200
But as it happens, I am the witness.

124
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:44,280
What?

125
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:50,800
Does the Princess also have evidence of Chu Beichi's treason?

126
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:53,440
The matter has not yet been settled.

127
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:55,800
Why are you so sure he is guilty of treason, Uncle?

128
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:57,720
Wuyou is my own child.

129
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,480
He is also the Princess's blood relative.

130
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,240
And a member of the royal family.

131
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:04,080
Just the crime of harming the royal family alone

132
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:07,560
Even if Chu Beichi has achieved great military feats,

133
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:08,960
he cannot escape punishment.

134
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,920
But what if

135
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,920
it was the heir who committed treason first?

136
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:18,960
Princess, what do you mean by this?

137
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:21,840
The Xuanjia Army of the Northern Border has made great contributions.

138
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,320
They should have been rewarded.

139
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:25,800
But the heir falsely accused them of desertion.

140
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,080
And harmed their families.

141
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,000
This greatly damaged the morale of the troops.

142
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:31,080
It shook the foundation of our kingdom.

143
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:34,480
Whose interests did this serve?

144
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,280
Is this true?

145
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,320
In contrast, Chu Beichi

146
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:44,320
has been working tirelessly for the families of the soldiers.

147
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:46,440
His loyalty is clear as day.

148
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:48,760
If he were a traitor,

149
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,800
why would he be so dedicated?

150
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:53,080
Yet, looking at certain others,

151
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,040
they cannot distinguish right from wrong.

152
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:56,320
And aid the wicked.

153
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,840
Princess, are you implying

154
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:02,320
that the heir deliberately created a false case

155
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,880
in an attempt to rebel?

156
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:07,840
And that Chu Beichi is actually a loyal and capable general?

157
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:11,920
Nonsense.

158
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:17,440
Uncle.

159
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:22,640
But the actions of the crown prince

160
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:24,400
how can the royal uncle deny them?

161
00:10:25,520 --> 00:10:28,400
The families that I and Chu Beichi rescued

162
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,640
are all living witnesses.

163
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:32,040
Even so,

164
00:10:32,520 --> 00:10:34,520
that is just one of the mistakes.

165
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,920
It was merely a rumor.

166
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,560
Such a trivial matter,

167
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,000
would you dare to harm a royal in public over it?

168
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:43,520
Trivial?

169
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,240
Your Highness, you are downplaying it.

170
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:50,480
Do you know, Your Highness, that the word "rumor"

171
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,680
has caused so many people to suffer abuse and injustice?

172
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,840
Some even lost their lives because of it.

173
00:10:58,160 --> 00:10:58,920
Your Highness,

174
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:03,960
do you want the Xuanjia Army to lose faith in the court?

175
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,840
If chaos breaks out in the north,

176
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:08,920
it will shake the foundation of our nation.

177
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:10,840
In my opinion,

178
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:12,920
those who fabricated the false charges against the deserters

179
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,880
are the real culprits.

180
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:20,600
At most, they deceived their superiors and hid the truth.

181
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,960
The crown prince was also misled.

182
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,080
But Chu Beichi acted without distinguishing right from wrong

183
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,600
and used the opportunity to kill the crown prince.

184
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,160
That is still an act of treason.

185
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,240
All the officials involved are either dead or insane.

186
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:37,720
There must be something suspicious about this case.

187
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,120
I will investigate thoroughly.

188
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:40,760
Very well.

189
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,440
Then, Princess, investigate as you wish.

190
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,680
But Chu Beichi must die today.

191
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:55,440
Guards!

192
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:55,960
Yes!

193
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,240
Execute Chu Beichi on the spot.

194
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:58,760
Yes!

195
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,880
Who dares?

196
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,400
Princess

197
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,920
Are we really going to turn against each other over a rebel?

198
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,440
After all, the Princess is His Majesty's only blood relative.

199
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,240
If anything happens to her,

200
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:20,120
wouldn't His Majesty be heartbroken?

201
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,360
The Princess would also be letting down the late Noble Consort's spirit in heaven.

202
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,480
I hope the Princess will think carefully.

203
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,720
Otherwise,

204
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,800
blades know no mercy.

205
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,680
How dare you mention my mother?

206
00:12:35,240 --> 00:12:37,600
His Majesty has arrived.
