1
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,960
Chu Beichi killed a royal family member in public.

2
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:05,480
This is an unforgivable crime.

3
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:07,720
Detain him and await trial.

4
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,680
Chu Beichi.

5
00:01:18,280 --> 00:01:19,800
How dare you plot against a royal family member?

6
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:21,040
By doing this,

7
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:22,800
are you trying to implicate the Chu family?

8
00:01:23,240 --> 00:01:24,320
Release the young prince immediately.

9
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:25,680
Otherwise, I will not forgive you.

10
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:31,360
Feixue.

11
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,520
Brothers,

12
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,080
today I will use his life

13
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,720
to atone to all of you.

14
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,160
Is Father still well?

15
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:58,760
Now you remember Father?

16
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,080
You killed a royal relative.

17
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,280
That is a crime punishable by extermination of the whole family.

18
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,760
If we hadn't severed ties with you earlier,

19
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,080
and if Prince Qi weren't so kind-hearted,

20
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,840
the entire Chu family would probably be imprisoned here.

21
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:13,520
Don't expect Father to save you.

22
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,040
Just wait for death quietly.

23
00:02:18,040 --> 00:02:19,640
We are brothers by blood.

24
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:22,200
Do you really wish for my death?

25
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:27,240
You're the one who brought this upon yourself.

26
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:29,280
You're just a concubine's son.

27
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,920
You don't know your place.

28
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:33,160
You've opposed me time and again.

29
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:36,320
You knew I served the young prince.

30
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:38,560
Yet you killed him.

31
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,640
And you repeatedly humiliated me in front of everyone.

32
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,680
How could I possibly let this go?

33
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:45,640
The heir harmed loyal subjects.

34
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,360
He deserved to die.

35
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:47,960
Enough.

36
00:02:52,520 --> 00:02:55,360
Still making excuses even at death's door.

37
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,800
All I know is,

38
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:59,560
from the moment you woke up,

39
00:03:00,240 --> 00:03:01,880
everyone's attention

40
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:04,280
shifted to you.

41
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:06,800
I am the legitimate son of the Chu family.

42
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,720
Yet I became nothing but your foil.

43
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,800
Isn't that a joke?

44
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,560
But now, things have changed.

45
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,120
You no longer have the right to compete with me.

46
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:23,840
It's funny when you think about it.

47
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:27,720
Before, you refused to end your own life for the future of the Chu family.

48
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:29,160
But now,

49
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:32,120
you're willing to risk your life for a few unrelated people.

50
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,800
Even if it costs you your life.

51
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,320
Chu Fengyu,

52
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,440
as a soldier of Datian,

53
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:40,720
you watched them be labeled as deserters,

54
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:41,800
and their families suffer.

55
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,400
How can you bear it?

56
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,640
I am a general.

57
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:49,080
I am only following orders.

58
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,080
Whether they are deserters or not,

59
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,200
whether they were wronged or not,

60
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,120
what does it have to do with me?

61
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,680
In my eyes,

62
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,680
they are nothing but stepping stones for my achievements.

63
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:01,680
The essence of being a general

64
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,040
is to distinguish right from wrong,

65
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:04,200
and to protect the common people.

66
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,920
If you only know how to kill and fight,

67
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:09,680
you will become nothing more than a tool for killing.

68
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:12,000
To win without killing,

69
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,120
and bring peace to the world.

70
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,080
To win without killing,

71
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,400
and bring peace to the world.

72
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:35,800
In this letter from the Divine General of Kunlun,

73
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,280
how much deeper meaning is hidden between the lines?

74
00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,760
All that I have said,

75
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:47,840
do you still remember?

76
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:50,040
How could you...

77
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:50,840
You...

78
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,600
No matter how many skills you have, what does it matter?

79
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,480
The King of Qi didn't take his anger out on the Chu family.

80
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:22,040
Instead, because I am the successor of the Kunlun Divine General,

81
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:23,800
he continued to entrust me with important responsibilities.

82
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,440
I can make achievements and build my career again.

83
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:29,680
But you,

84
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,320
can only die in disgrace.

85
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,000
Forgotten by everyone.

86
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:39,360
Between you and me,

87
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,480
I am the one who wins in the end.

88
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:47,640
Take him in.

89
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,400
Yes.

90
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,360
Move.

91
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:56,880
Go in.

92
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:58,000
In this way,

93
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,280
what kind of conspiracy is really hidden behind all this?

94
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,920
We will know soon.

95
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:07,800
Your Highness, Princess.

96
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:10,920
Where is Beichi?

97
00:06:14,440 --> 00:06:15,360
Your Highness.

98
00:06:16,520 --> 00:06:18,120
Chu Beichi killed a royal relative.

99
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:19,120
He cannot escape severe punishment.

100
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:20,920
Even you,

101
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:23,560
cannot change the laws of Datian, right?

102
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:26,560
If I find out

103
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,400
that he is not only innocent,

104
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,880
but has also rendered merit?

105
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:32,960
In a few days,

106
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,800
the Emperor will personally come to Binzhou.

107
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,480
He will personally try this case.

108
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:38,320
His Majesty will personally try this case.

109
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:41,600
At that time, I will explain everything to my father.

110
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:44,440
Not only will the wronged northern warriors be vindicated,

111
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,240
but Beichi will also be granted freedom.

112
00:06:47,320 --> 00:06:48,320
And those

113
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,160
who fabricated the false case of desertion,

114
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:51,520
and their accomplices,

115
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:53,000
none of them will escape.

116
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:02,600
Beichi, Siyen

117
00:07:03,600 --> 00:07:05,040
Why not reveal your true identity?

118
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,280
Why suffer here for nothing?

119
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:07,920
Calm down.

120
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:09,960
If we reveal our identity now,

121
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,600
how can we remove Prince Qi, this cancer?

122
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,080
What about the family?

123
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,880
Don't worry, Jiu Niang has been settled.

124
00:07:23,880 --> 00:07:24,680
What about her?

125
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,440
She's fine.

126
00:07:35,040 --> 00:07:37,640
Thank you, Princess Chu, for saving my life.

127
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:07,400
Your meridians are injured.

128
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,520
You need to rest and recover.

129
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:10,840
Princess.

130
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:14,560
Fortunately, Beichi sealed your fatal acupoint.

131
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,880
Otherwise, even I couldn't have saved you.

132
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,520
But Beichi also injured his meridians because of this.

133
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,320
But don't worry.

134
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:23,240
He'll be fine.

135
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:26,920
Thank you, Princess.

136
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:35,600
I'm glad you're alright.

137
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:38,760
Feixue will return to the Northern Territory immediately.

138
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:39,840
to lead the Xuanjia Army.

139
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:40,960
Awaiting your orders.

140
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,560
Prince Qi has already arrived at the Chu residence.

141
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:01,040
I didn't expect Prince Qi to be so scheming.

142
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,080
All the better.

143
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,440
I want to see

144
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:05,800
what kind of act they're putting on.

145
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:16,720
What does the young master think?

146
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,640
He only killed a scoundrel.

147
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,440
Yet he humbled himself to go to prison.

148
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:24,040
Beichi surely has his own plans.

149
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:25,400
We should trust him.

150
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:27,160
Princess.

151
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,360
Something terrible has happened.

152
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:31,120
No clues could be found in the homes of those who knew the truth.

153
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:32,000
Some are dead,

154
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,320
others have gone mad.

155
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,400
King Qi is truly ruthless in his schemes.

156
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,080
Calm down.

157
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,840
Since the young master has entered the game,

158
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,000
King Qi's fate

159
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,160
is already sealed.

160
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:09,080
Young Master Chu.

161
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,320
The situation outside has changed.

162
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:11,280
If you stay here any longer,

163
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:12,240
your life may be in danger.

164
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:14,240
His Highness sent me to get you out so we can discuss things further.

165
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,080
Come with me quickly.

166
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:21,040
Young master.
