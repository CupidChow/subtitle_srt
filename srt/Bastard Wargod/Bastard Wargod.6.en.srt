1
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:56,680
How about

2
00:00:58,320 --> 00:00:59,360
you give it a try?

3
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,720
General Chu,

4
00:01:02,720 --> 00:01:03,760
give it a try.

5
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:04,640
General Chu,

6
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:05,840
try it.

7
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,800
Let General Chu try.

8
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,160
Go ahead and try.

9
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,040
Yeah.

10
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:09,760
Exactly.

11
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,120
How can we let this fraud get away with it?

12
00:01:12,440 --> 00:01:13,520
That's right.

13
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:15,000
How can we let him be so smug?

14
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:16,360
General Chu,

15
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,400
give it a try.

16
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:19,000
General Chu,

17
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,320
try it.

18
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:24,760
Try it.

19
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:25,840
Try it.

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:26,720
Try it.

21
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:27,600
Try it.

22
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,600
Try it.

23
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:29,520
Try it.

24
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:51,360
Feng Yu,

25
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:53,200
what's going on?

26
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:55,040
General Chu,

27
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:56,280
your arm isn't broken, is it?

28
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,240
I have always served the country wholeheartedly,

29
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:01,680
but you all misjudge people.

30
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,320
I don't blame you.

31
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,960
My own reputation is as light as a feather,

32
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,240
but the reputation of the Xuanjia Army is as weighty as Mount Tai.

33
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,320
Today, I ask everyone here to witness

34
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,320
what the so-called truth really is.

35
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:30,600
Chu Beichi,

36
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:32,120
what are you going to do?

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,360
How dare he?

38
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,240
Master.

39
00:02:40,240 --> 00:02:42,080
You unfilial son, come down here!

40
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,320
Why wouldn't he dare?

41
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:46,120
In this world,

42
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:48,720
no one is more qualified than him.

43
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:54,800
Because he is—

44
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,360
General Shen Feixue has arrived!

45
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,040
Sister Feixue!

46
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:16,360
So this is the famed female general of the North, Shen Feixue.

47
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,520
Such heroic bearing—

48
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,880
it's truly rare to see.

49
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:20,960
Why hasn't the Divine General of Kunlun arrived yet?

50
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,400
Of course, we must deal with this useless one first.

51
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:24,720
Clear away the filth,

52
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,520
so we can properly welcome the Divine General of Kunlun.

53
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,400
It's been a long time, Sister Feixue.

54
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:34,920
Who are you calling sister?

55
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:36,280
I don't know you.

56
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:38,000
Sister, don't joke like that.

57
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,720
Ever since I arrived in the North,

58
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,000
you've always looked after me.

59
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,480
You taught me martial arts and movement skills.

60
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:43,800
How could you not recognize me?

61
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:46,240
Take care of you?

62
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,760
I'd rather take care of a wolf from the North.

63
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,200
Ungrateful wretch.

64
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:51,360
Absolutely ridiculous.

65
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:00,880
Anyway,

66
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,120
this gun ceremony is being held for me after all.

67
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,720
Shen Feixue,

68
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,040
don't think you can do whatever you want just because you're a female general.

69
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:13,440
If the Divine General knew how you treated me today,

70
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,760
he definitely wouldn't let you off easily.

71
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,400
The Kunlun Divine General must already regret it by now.

72
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:24,880
General Shen,

73
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:29,080
The Chu family's illegitimate son, Chu Beichi, first refused to admit his guilt,

74
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,560
then took the divine spear without permission,

75
00:04:30,760 --> 00:04:32,640
and now he's sitting on the throne.

76
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,760
This is showing contempt for the Xuanjia Army.

77
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:36,080
That's right.

78
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:37,320
Yeah.

79
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,240
He should be pulled down.

80
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:39,720
That's right.

81
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:40,600
He's disrespecting the Xuanjia Army.

82
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:41,880
How can he sit up there?

83
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,760
Chu Beichi is sitting in the Divine General's seat,

84
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,280
that's already a capital offense.

85
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:52,480
Sister Feixue, you must punish him severely.

86
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:53,880
That's right.

87
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,200
He is disrespectful to the Kunlun Divine General.

88
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:57,680
He really deserves to be punished.

89
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,840
So this is the person you call utterly unforgivable.

90
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:05,760
That's right.

91
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:08,720
Guards!

92
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:09,360
Here!

93
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:10,640
Bring out the military staff.

94
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,120
Yes.

95
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,600
Let's see how you handle this now.

96
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:30,200
Sister Feixue

97
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:31,160
What are you doing?

98
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,240
What are you all doing?

99
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:33,800
Is there some mistake?

100
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,520
Hit him.

101
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,800
Why are you hitting my son?

102
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,040
Today,

103
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,480
I will severely punish you,

104
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:40,560
you ungrateful, unprincipled traitor.

105
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,720
Stop!

106
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:51,440
You may be spared death, but you can't escape punishment.

107
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:53,080
Kneel here.

108
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,480
And await your sentence.

109
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:56,040
General Shen

110
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:58,760
These people keep saying

111
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,360
that Young Master Chu colluded with the blood bandits last night.

112
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:02,960
As it happens,

113
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,280
I have a witness.

114
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:11,040
Bring in the witness.

115
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,440
This person is the blood bandit who conspired with Chu Beichi.

116
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:22,000
General Shen, quickly eliminate him!

117
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,680
I am an imperial envoy sent by the Emperor.

118
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:35,640
Liuli

119
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,320
It's true.

120
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,080
He really is an imperial envoy.

121
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,960
Last night was merely a military exercise in disguise.

122
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,120
It was to test General Chu Fengyu's skills.

123
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,400
But unexpectedly, he was useless.

124
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:58,400
Not only is the so-called Blood Bandit actually the Imperial Envoy,

125
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:01,080
but Chu Beichi is also a member of the Xuanjia Army.

126
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,760
The reputation of the Xuanjia Army is the best proof.

127
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:06,400
It proves he would never do such a treacherous thing.

128
00:07:08,360 --> 00:07:11,280
Last night's Blood Bandit incident was actually the Imperial Envoy's drill.

129
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:13,360
And he is a member of the Xuanjia Army.

130
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,640
No wonder, General Chu.

131
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,840
No wonder.

132
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,240
I didn't expect him to be this kind of person.

133
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:20,200
He is not what he seems.

134
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,880
General Chu.

135
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:21,720
Indeed.

136
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:22,840
We have wronged him.

137
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,520
Truly unexpected.

138
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:26,480
Feng Yu.

139
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,240
Do you accept this?

140
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:29,880
Or not?

141
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,280
Are you really from the Xuanjia Army?

142
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:35,840
Of course.

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:38,560
The matter between you and Young Master Chu

144
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,680
will be discussed later.

145
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:41,840
Right now, I have more important matters.

146
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,120
Why are you kneeling?

147
00:07:50,120 --> 00:07:51,120
Kneeling to him.

148
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:53,160
Young Master Chu.

149
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,440
Would you

150
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:58,760
marry me?

151
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,240
Feixue.

152
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:05,400
Stop this nonsense.

153
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:06,800
Young Master.

154
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:09,440
Just let me be willful this once.

155
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,840
The Northern Army Commander respectfully presents

156
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:15,280
a Guardian Qilin statue from Donghu.

157
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:17,960
a pair of jade Biluos from the South Sea.

158
00:08:18,640 --> 00:08:20,880
and a masterfully crafted Golden Dragon incense burner.

159
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:30,720
Young master,

160
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,760
Feixue arrived too late.

161
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:35,120
I caused you to suffer such injustice.

162
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:37,200
To make it up to you,

163
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:39,320
You are unmarried, and so am I.

164
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,480
Feixue dares to ask you once more,

165
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:43,040
would you be willing to marry me?

166
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,240
Feixue...

167
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,800
You don't have to do this.

168
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,680
A proposal?

169
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,760
The Empress of Beilie has arrived!

170
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:37,280
What a coincidence.

171
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,080
I am also here to propose.

172
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,080
Not to mention, you are the esteemed Empress of Beilie,

173
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,200
it's rather improper to seek to marry a citizen of Datian.

174
00:09:56,080 --> 00:09:59,040
You come to propose empty-handed,

175
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,560
isn't that a bit shabby?

176
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,560
Shabby?

177
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:06,960
Does everyone recognize this item?

178
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:11,880
This...

179
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,000
This is the Imperial Seal of Beilie!

180
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,720
Imperial Seal.

181
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,400
I offer my kingdom as a betrothal gift.

182
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,280
All I ask for is him alone.

183
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:30,680
The imperial seal is an object that secures the nation.

184
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,040
How could you give it away so casually?

185
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:37,600
The word "love"—

186
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,680
cannot be suppressed by power,

187
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,160
nor taken away by influence.

188
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:43,400
Since I love him,

189
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,840
naturally,

190
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,040
I want to give him the most precious gift.

191
00:10:49,320 --> 00:10:50,400
Besides,

192
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:55,240
I admire his integrity and value his talent.

193
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,920
I believe he can bear the responsibility,

194
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,200
and is worthy of this vast land.

195
00:11:01,840 --> 00:11:02,800
The kingdom—

196
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,880
Her Majesty truly follows her heart.

197
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:06,960
I wonder who could be so fortunate to receive such a match.

198
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,280
Are we to witness two weddings today?

199
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:14,680
Her Majesty has arrived.

200
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:15,840
Forgive me for not welcoming you from afar.

201
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:18,200
Why didn't you inform us in advance?

202
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,480
So I could have prepared ahead of time.

203
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:23,120
I'm not here to see you.

204
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,720
May I ask whom Your Majesty wishes to marry?

205
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,440
The one I wish to marry

206
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:33,600
is, of course, the Divine General of Kunlun.

207
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:40,240
The Kunlun Divine General has not yet arrived.

208
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,280
You

209
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,400
The Divine General has not arrived.

210
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,040
But isn't my son Feng Yu, the future Kunlun Divine General, right here?

211
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,840
Even the Empress of Beilie is willing to humble herself and marry him.

212
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,760
General Chu truly has a bright future.

213
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:57,400
A hero emerges from the young.

214
00:11:57,560 --> 00:11:59,040
General Chu, please rise.

215
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:04,920
When I ascend to the throne of Beilie,

216
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,240
if you, this good-for-nothing, know what's best for you,

217
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:09,480
I can still remember our brotherhood.

218
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:12,240
I might reluctantly spare your life.

219
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:13,800
Tell me,

220
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,920
is he the Kunlun Divine General?

221
00:12:16,960 --> 00:12:18,160
Thanks to the Empress's great favor,

222
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,840
Feng Yu will not fail your trust.

223
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,240
I swear to protect the Empress with my life.

224
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,000
And unite Datian and Beilie in lasting alliance.

225
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,400
How strange.

226
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:34,880
Then who is he?

227
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:40,320
There is something the Empress does not know.

228
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:42,680
This man is Chu Beichi, a criminal from Binzhou.

229
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:46,080
He was only spared because General Shen protected him.

230
00:12:52,640 --> 00:12:54,120
As long as you agree,

231
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,920
I will kill all those who wronged you.

232
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:00,440
Come back to Beilie with me and live freely.

233
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:01,520
How about it?

234
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,880
Young Master Chu,

235
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,840
of course, he should stay at my Ruyi Pavilion.

236
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:17,280
Young Master Chu is coming back to the Northern Territory with me.

237
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,680
Young Master Chu should stay at Ruyi Pavilion.

238
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:20,560
He is coming back to Beilie with me.

239
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,040
You are not worthy to compete with me.

240
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:23,600
I will kill you all.

241
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,960
This is not your territory.

242
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:25,800
Enough.

243
00:13:30,440 --> 00:13:31,840
My heart already belongs to someone.

244
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,000
In this life, I care for no one but

245
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:36,920
Jiang Siyan alone.

246
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,200
Since the occasion is so lively,

247
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,360
our princess would also like to offer a small gift

248
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,080
as a token of respect.
