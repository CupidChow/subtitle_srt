1
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:05,120
General Chu has inherited the great legacy of the Divine General.

2
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:06,880
He upholds the spirit of a true patriot.

3
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,360
His future is boundless.

4
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:11,400
You flatter me.

5
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,440
That is too much praise.

6
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:15,160
I have only done my duty.

7
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,400
I dare not claim credit.

8
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:19,040
If one day,

9
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,680
I can bring fortune to the people,

10
00:01:20,680 --> 00:01:21,960
and serve Da Tian loyally,

11
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,040
I will not fail your expectations.

12
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:26,320
However,

13
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:29,680
today, the people of the city will use this chance to publicly judge Chu Beichi.

14
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,480
I hope you can forgive us.

15
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:35,760
Chu Beichi, that useless fool who deceives the people,

16
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,520
watch how I take his life today.

17
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:42,320
Upon hearing that General Chu will hold a public trial,

18
00:01:42,440 --> 00:01:44,400
I doubt he would dare to show up.

19
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:47,920
He has probably already fled by now.

20
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:53,360
It's truly lively here today.

21
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,240
Chu Beichi.

22
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,480
You actually dared to come.

23
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,480
It seems I won't need to act personally today.

24
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:31,080
How dare you be so arrogant after committing such heinous crimes?

25
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,400
What crime have I committed?

26
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,720
Everyone, feel free to list them all.

27
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:38,240
Chu Beichi, you colluded with the Blood Bandits.

28
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:41,560
You used the three great families to amass wealth.

29
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,600
Last night, you even tried to repeat your old tricks.

30
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,400
You’re still so full of treacherous intent.

31
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:49,960
You truly are a heartless and unrighteous scoundrel.

32
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:50,760
That's right.

33
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:51,560
Lord Chu, please—

34
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:52,280
General Chu—

35
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,200
Eliminate this traitor.

36
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:54,240
Avenge us.

37
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,000
Avenge us!

38
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,040
Avenge us!

39
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,880
Avenge us! Avenge us!

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,480
I think you’re just making up stories.

41
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,440
None of us can match your glib tongues.

42
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:04,280
You’re twisting the facts out of thin air.

43
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,440
Repaying kindness with hatred.

44
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:07,320
Distorting the truth.

45
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,520
If General Shen weren’t outside the city,

46
00:03:10,960 --> 00:03:12,600
I’m afraid the whole city of Binzhou

47
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,280
would have been littered with corpses by now.

48
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,000
Yes.

49
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,440
That's right.

50
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,200
Exactly.

51
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:23,480
Your Chu family profits off the three great families.

52
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,040
Do you dare deny it?

53
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:27,880
How dare you slander the Chu family without evidence!

54
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:30,080
Slander!

55
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,680
I have detailed account books in my hands.

56
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:00,720
General Chu

57
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:02,040
So many!

58
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,280
Come, everyone, take a good look.

59
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,680
You take a look too.

60
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:11,040
Everyone can have a look.

61
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,280
This is real.

62
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,760
The Chu family owns so much land and property.

63
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,040
But very little is actually spent on Young Master Chu.

64
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:20,200
That's true.

65
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,760
Lord Chu's salary isn't that much either.

66
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,800
How is this possible?

67
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:24,800
Yeah.

68
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:28,960
How could there be so much?

69
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,760
I receive a military allowance.

70
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:34,560
I send some silver home.

71
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,440
Plus, my mother is good at business.

72
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,000
It's not impossible for money to make more money.

73
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:43,680
Everyone, don't be fooled by him.

74
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:48,440
Our purpose today is to judge whether Chu Beichi colluded with the Blood Bandits.

75
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,800
Speak.

76
00:04:50,120 --> 00:04:51,480
Are you all in this together?

77
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:52,960
Are you all in this together?

78
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:55,520
Say it, go on!

79
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:57,520
Are you in this together?

80
00:04:57,880 --> 00:04:59,120
Are you all in this together?

81
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:01,200
Are you all in this together?

82
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:09,920
I was the one who saved you in the first place.

83
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,360
It was someone else who asked you for money.

84
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,240
It was still me who saved you last night.

85
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:17,520
By doing this,

86
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,280
I didn't gain any benefit.

87
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,240
Besides,

88
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,960
I'm wealthy enough to rival a nation.

89
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:26,480
Young master, you really didn't need to go to such trouble.

90
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:29,560
Why don't you answer?

91
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:32,160
Actually,

92
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,160
Actually,

93
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,520
He has been pretending to be ill for the past three years.

94
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,960
Now I have no choice but to say it.

95
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,600
Say it.

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,480
Hurry, say it.

97
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:41,520
Madam, please say it.

98
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,040
Say it.

99
00:05:42,040 --> 00:05:42,760
Madam.

100
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:44,960
Master.

101
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:47,960
Right now, protecting Feng Yu is the most important thing.

102
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,480
These past three years

103
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:54,640
he and that wretched girl

104
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
have been living in debauchery every night.

105
00:05:56,200 --> 00:05:59,240
We had to cover it up to protect the Chu family's reputation.

106
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:00,200
It's all nonsense.

107
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:02,640
And as for this Jiu Niang,

108
00:06:02,920 --> 00:06:05,200
where did all her wealth come from?

109
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:07,200
She must have taken it from everyone else.

110
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,040
She's just a brothel owner.

111
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:10,000
How could she be any good?

112
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,120
Shut your filthy mouth.

113
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:14,400
Everyone, look!

114
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:16,080
They're fighting!

115
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:16,960
Guards!

116
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:17,960
Lord Chu

117
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:19,440
This boy is unbelievably arrogant.

118
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,040
When the Kunlun Divine General arrives,

119
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:22,880
won't he even dare to defy the Divine General?

120
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,720
The Divine General kills people like they're nothing.

121
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:28,680
By then, your whole Chu family will be implicated.

122
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,640
So according to you,

123
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,440
the Kunlun Divine General is lawless,

124
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,720
and only knows how to kill at the slightest provocation,

125
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:37,560
a bloodthirsty maniac.

126
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,880
Mind your manners!

127
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:40,280
You're being utterly rebellious.

128
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:41,600
Don't cause any more trouble.

129
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:43,560
I'll take responsibility for everything today.

130
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,520
At least it will protect the Chu family's reputation.

131
00:06:51,240 --> 00:06:52,800
Sometimes I wonder,

132
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:55,120
are you really my father?

133
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:01,920
Before Sister Feixue arrives,

134
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,840
I advise you to confess now.

135
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,000
She's the most capable general at the Divine General's side.

136
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:08,520
If she comes,

137
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,040
your punishment will only be worse.

138
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,120
Shen Feixue

139
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,320
Even if she comes, she'll have to bow to me.

140
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,720
You're truly clueless even at death's door.

141
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,280
Why would Shen Feixue of the Northern Territory take his orders?

142
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,000
For the sake of our brotherhood,

143
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,840
I could kill you with the Kunlun Divine Spear.

144
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,600
Old friend,

145
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,600
I almost entrusted you to such a despicable person.

146
00:07:53,960 --> 00:07:54,800
Are you scared?

147
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:03,040
Since we were young, you always overshadowed me.

148
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:07,880
But now, you’re just a cripple.

149
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,440
While I have a bright future ahead.

150
00:08:10,920 --> 00:08:13,400
Everyone’s attention is on me.

151
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,360
To die by the Kunlun Divine Spear today

152
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,520
is considered your honor.

153
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,160
You once had a promising future.

154
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:33,920
But it was all ruined by your vile thoughts.

155
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,040
You want to kill me today,

156
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:38,680
then let’s see

157
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,360
if you can even lift the Divine Spear.

158
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:02,120
What’s going on?

159
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,400
General Chu,

160
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:07,960
why can’t you lift it?

161
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,440
Are you up to it or not?

162
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:16,120
General Chu, don’t tell me you can’t pick it up?

163
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:18,120
Feng Yu,

164
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,480
hurry and pick it up!

165
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:20,200
Feng Yu,

166
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:21,680
Could it be that General Chu can’t lift it?

167
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,360
I just remembered,

168
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,280
the Kunlun Divine Spear is meant to protect the country and its people.

169
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:32,800
It's so sacred,

170
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,360
how could it be used to kill such a petty person?

171
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,480
That's right.

172
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,960
Exactly.

173
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,520
General Chu, you are wise.

174
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,640
How about I get it for you?

175
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:51,000
You think you're worthy to even touch the Kunlun Divine Spear?

176
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:51,920
Exactly.

177
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,520
You're just a useless person.

178
00:09:52,520 --> 00:09:53,320
Him?

179
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,880
He should know his own limits.

180
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,600
Oh, I almost forgot,

181
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:00,680
you're a cripple.

182
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:03,560
A cripple can't even stand up,

183
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,560
how could you possibly lift it?

184
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:08,280
You're right.

185
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,120
I'm sitting in this wheelchair,

186
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,200
so I really can't do much.

187
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,040
If you can really lift the Kunlun Divine Spear,

188
00:10:15,320 --> 00:10:16,760
I'll kneel and bow to you in front of everyone.

189
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,120
I'll kowtow and pay my respects to you.

190
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:20,240
I'll say this here as well,

191
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:22,480
as long as you can lift this spear,

192
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:26,160
General Chu and I will both kneel and apologize to you.

193
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,320
Count me in too.

194
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:32,000
Me as well.

195
00:10:33,560 --> 00:10:34,640
Are you serious?

196
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:35,600
What?

197
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:36,600
Are you afraid?

198
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:40,800
You've already said it.

199
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,600
There's no taking it back now.

200
00:10:43,720 --> 00:10:44,840
Once a word is spoken,

201
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:46,120
even four horses can't chase it down.

202
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:47,800
Alright.

203
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,200
Wasn't he supposed to be lame?

204
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:57,240
So he was faking it.

205
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,680
He's been deceiving us all along.

206
00:10:58,680 --> 00:10:59,760
How did he stand up?

207
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:01,240
Look.

208
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,400
He really was pretending.

209
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,720
We were right.

210
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:26,720
After this, the gun...

211
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:31,600
You should hand it over to Feng Yu.

212
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:34,120
Yes.

213
00:11:44,080 --> 00:11:44,840
What?

214
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:46,280
How is that possible?

215
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:48,000
He actually picked it up.

216
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:55,520
Kneel.

217
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,080
Who exactly is he?

218
00:11:59,280 --> 00:12:00,920
He can actually lift that gun.

219
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:04,000
I heard this gun weighs a thousand jin.

220
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,640
I thought even the general couldn't lift it.

221
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,040
Let alone this useless man.

222
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:07,880
Who would have thought?

223
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,680
What should we do now?

224
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,840
If he can lift this gun,

225
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,360
he must be a true hero.

226
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,240
He made me look so bad.

227
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,920
Why should I kneel to him?

228
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,360
Everyone, don't forget our original purpose today.

229
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,000
I have just investigated.

230
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:28,880
This gun

231
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:30,920
is actually a fake.

232
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,400
You'll understand when General Shen arrives.

233
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:34,640
A fake?

234
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:35,640
No wonder.

235
00:12:36,920 --> 00:12:38,080
It's fake.

236
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:41,200
How about

237
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
you give it a try?
