1
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:02,920
Brothers!

2
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,080
The court is corrupt, and the country has no good ministers.

3
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,840
Today, we, the Divine Generals of Kunlun, will seek justice for the loyal souls of the northern frontier.

4
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:10,080
Rise up with me!

5
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:11,400
Destroy Datian!

6
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,720
Kill!

7
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,720
Kill!

8
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:14,480
Kill!

9
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:15,120
Kill!

10
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:15,800
Kill!

11
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,440
Kill!

12
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:17,360
Kill!

13
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:18,280
Your Majesty!

14
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:20,600
Your Majesty, something terrible has happened!

15
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:22,400
The Divine Generals of Kunlun have raised an army in rebellion!

16
00:01:27,440 --> 00:01:28,760
How is this possible?

17
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,520
I would not dare to lie.

18
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:32,240
The rebels are wearing the armor of the Black Armored Army.

19
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:33,520
They carry the battle flags of the Northern Army.

20
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:34,520
They are shouting,

21
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:36,360
"Seeking justice for the soldiers of the Northern Army!"

22
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:38,160
They also say

23
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,000
they will cut off the tyrant's head

24
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,000
to appease the wronged souls.

25
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,520
The Black Armored Army has rebelled!

26
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:43,560
Run!

27
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:47,000
The Black Armored Army has rebelled!

28
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:51,760
Your Majesty,

29
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:54,240
it must be because my son was killed.

30
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:56,280
Someone has made a big deal out of this.

31
00:01:56,680 --> 00:01:58,520
The news has even reached the Xuanjia Army.

32
00:01:58,800 --> 00:01:59,480
Otherwise,

33
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:02,600
the Xuanjia Army wouldn't act like this for no reason.

34
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:03,920
So, in that case,

35
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:06,840
Chu Beichi is the main culprit who incited the rebellion.

36
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:09,360
The princess is also not blameless.

37
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:11,320
Even if the court mishandled things,

38
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:13,160
it could have been resolved privately.

39
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,800
To preserve the royal family's dignity.

40
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,480
But the princess made this matter known to the whole world.

41
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:18,240
Exactly.

42
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,560
At a time like this,

43
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,040
why are we still talking about this?

44
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:23,360
The Kunlun Divine General has rebelled.

45
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:25,600
What should we do now?

46
00:02:26,520 --> 00:02:27,800
Please rest assured, Your Majesty.

47
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,160
I believe

48
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,520
the Kunlun Divine General has advanced alone this time.

49
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:32,680
Although his momentum is great,

50
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,760
he cannot last long.

51
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,160
Please issue an imperial decree, Your Majesty,

52
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:36,680
to gather troops from all directions.

53
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:39,720
I am willing to lead the army to eliminate the northern rebels.

54
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,600
To ensure Da Tian remains safe.

55
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:48,200
Are you suggesting we declare war on all the Xuanjia Army?

56
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:49,680
Your Majesty,

57
00:02:50,240 --> 00:02:51,840
this is an act to suppress the rebellion.

58
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:55,120
The Xuanjia Army is the most prestigious elite force in the north.

59
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:56,560
If they rebel,

60
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,360
the northern army will surely follow suit.

61
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:00,360
In my opinion,

62
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,360
we should strike first to gain the upper hand.

63
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,000
If you send the royal army to the border,

64
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,840
it’s no different from forcing the northern soldiers to their doom.

65
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,480
Such internal strife

66
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,520
is undoubtedly destroying the nation and toppling the dynasty.

67
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:17,160
Your Highness,

68
00:03:17,720 --> 00:03:20,440
do you intend to cut off Da Tian’s fate?

69
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,480
Nonsense.

70
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:29,640
Did you really think you were the Divine General of Kunlun?

71
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,320
If all these years I’ve only survived under your protection,

72
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,080
then I’d rather die.

73
00:03:42,440 --> 00:03:43,040
Your Majesty,

74
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:45,480
I am willing to follow Prince Qi to lead the troops and repel the enemy.

75
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,320
I beg Your Majesty to first execute Chu Beichi.

76
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:51,480
I will take his head and present it to the Divine General.

77
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:53,600
With my relationship with the Divine General,

78
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,720
he will surely withdraw his troops.

79
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,280
and keep Da Tian safe.

80
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:00,720
If I die,

81
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:02,080
this world

82
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,760
will fall into chaos.

83
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:10,360
Even facing death, you still boast shamelessly.

84
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:12,880
Do you realize the crimes you’ve committed

85
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:16,840
are unforgivable, even if you die a hundred or a thousand times?

86
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:21,880
Please, Your Majesty, issue the decree quickly.

87
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:23,000
Let your younger brother command the troops.

88
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,200
You will surely be safe in the city.

89
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,440
What are you standing there for?

90
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,880
Hurry and hand over the tiger tally to His Majesty.

91
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,080
Father, you mustn’t!

92
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,200
Father, you mustn’t!

93
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,320
Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

94
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:13,000
Chu Beichi, let go of His Majesty!

95
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:14,040
Beichi!

96
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:15,080
Nobody move!

97
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:24,000
The one who wants to kill the king and seize power

98
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:26,000
is probably someone else.

99
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,320
You—

100
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,240
Your Majesty!

101
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:31,160
I’ll have to trouble you for now.

102
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:33,280
Si Yan.

103
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,440
Chu Beichi

104
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:47,000
Are you trying to seize power and rebel?

105
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,000
Guards!

106
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:48,920
Here!

107
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:49,640
Nobody move!

108
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:51,600
The Emperor is here.

109
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:52,920
I want to see who dares to act rashly.

110
00:05:53,480 --> 00:05:54,600
All of you, stand down!

111
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,960
Why aren't you clearing the way?

112
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:57,240
Move aside!

113
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:01,600
Go.

114
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:04,480
Chu Beichi

115
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:06,760
Your actions today

116
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:09,120
will surely lead you to ruin.

117
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,360
The Princess and Chu Beichi

118
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:23,640
have taken His Majesty hostage.

119
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:25,240
Take men and pursue them at once!

120
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,880
Kill everyone involved without mercy!

121
00:06:29,920 --> 00:06:30,200
Yes!

122
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:31,440
But what about the rebels outside the city?

123
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,320
Rescue His Majesty first.

124
00:06:34,600 --> 00:06:35,320
Yes!

125
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:36,920
Let's go.

126
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,640
You've saved me again.

127
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:52,080
Divine General of Kunlun

128
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:54,040
Tell me your plan.

129
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:57,440
If my guess is correct,

130
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:00,400
the fake Divine General outside the city must have been arranged by Prince Qi.

131
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:04,600
His goal is to have Your Majesty killed in Binzhou City.

132
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,200
And then blame the Xuanjia Army.

133
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:10,560
So,

134
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,600
Prince Qi used fake Xuanjia soldiers to confuse everyone.

135
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,640
He wants to force the Emperor to hand over military power.

136
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:19,000
But

137
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:23,200
all of this was actually part of Beichi's plan.

138
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,280
That's right.

139
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,280
But he doesn't know the real Divine General is right here.

140
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,680
And has even become my son-in-law.

141
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,320
Divine General,

142
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,520
what exactly are you doing?

143
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:49,000
Let alone killing just a mere crown prince,

144
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:50,880
even if you wanted my life,

145
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:51,760
I would still...

146
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:53,520
Your Majesty,

147
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:56,120
since you trust me so much,

148
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:57,840
how could I just stand by and do nothing?

149
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:02,680
Besides,

150
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,960
I do this for the people of the world.

151
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,040
Your Majesty, please

152
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,760
act with me when the time is right.

153
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,000
Back then, when you were unconscious,

154
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:14,840
I thought you would be safer with the Chu family.

155
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,000
But I never expected that this whole family

156
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:18,920
would be a bunch of fools.

157
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,160
If it weren't for your status as the Divine General,

158
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:25,800
the Chu family would no longer exist today.

159
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:27,760
Thank you, Your Majesty.

160
00:08:28,440 --> 00:08:29,240
Princess.

161
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:31,760
Young Master.

162
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:33,640
You have returned.

163
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,920
The families of the soldiers have been settled.

164
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:38,120
Good.

165
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:40,480
If anything goes wrong, that would truly be chaos.

166
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:42,760
What about the rebel forces outside the city?

167
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:45,920
The people of Binzhou are all living in fear.

168
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:49,040
The rebels impersonating the Xuanjia Army have already camped outside the city.

169
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:51,240
They don't seem to be preparing to attack the city.

170
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:54,360
They just keep shouting something.

171
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,440
Hand over the dog emperor!

172
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,840
What is King Qi's current move?

173
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:08,200
King Qi insists that the northern border is rebelling.

174
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,320
If the truth is not made public soon,

175
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:12,600
I'm afraid it will cause a civil war in Datian.

176
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,760
The Xuanjia Army has sworn to protect the nation.

177
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:15,640
How could they possibly rebel?

178
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:18,560
Now everyone outside says His Majesty has grown senile, that's why—

179
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:20,360
Liuli.

180
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:22,000
Your Majesty.

181
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,280
I misspoke just now.

182
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,440
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

183
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,200
It's all right, you may rise.

184
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:34,640
I...

185
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,440
Liuli is right.

186
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,760
I am getting old.

187
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:45,120
