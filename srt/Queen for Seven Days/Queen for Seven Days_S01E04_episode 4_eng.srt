1
00:00:42,650 --> 00:00:47,100
Why did you do that? Exactly why?

2
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,510
Because... of the throne.

3
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,480
What?

4
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:01,650
Did you just say it was because of the throne?

5
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:04,130
It's said the public sentiment is the same as Heaven's will.

6
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:07,670
If you abandon the people, how can you keep the throne?

7
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:11,390
If you don't consider the fundamental cause of this,

8
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:13,920
and just carry out punishment no matter what,

9
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:16,530
the public sentiment will abandon Your Majesty.

10
00:01:19,870 --> 00:01:23,840
Are you trying to teach me right now?

11
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,980
Mencius wrote that if the king commits wrongdoing, advise the king and advise him yet again to prevent misrule.

12
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:32,030
It's the duty of the subject to do so.

13
00:01:32,030 --> 00:01:38,030
Fine! I wondered why you were so impudent and unruly.

14
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:40,940
It's because you read that outrageous old man's writings.

15
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:43,810
You are acting up because you believe in the nonsense that the old man wrote.

16
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,960
It's permissible to overthrow the king if the king is at fault.

17
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:49,010
Duty of a subject?

18
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,790
Using Mencius as an excuse, you must be planning to become the king!

19
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:55,390
Your Majesty! How can you?

20
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,230
Think what you will!

21
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:01,970
No matter what I say, you won't listen.

22
00:02:01,970 --> 00:02:05,170
With what power can I change your thoughts?

23
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:11,810
You must really want to die.

24
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:16,740
You're the ruler of this Joseon.

25
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:18,670
You can do anything you want.

26
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,400
What are you all doing?

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:27,420
Throw him into prison right away!

28
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:42,190
Grand Prince Jin Seong is imprisoned now. 
  Episode 4 

29
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,230
Judgment will be determined in a couple of days.

30
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,080
Grand princes can be imprisoned? Flogged as well?

31
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:54,820
However serious his offense may be, he is still a royal.

32
00:02:54,820 --> 00:02:57,690
He's the king's younger brother.

33
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:01,510
As the king's younger brother he committed an action that can never be permitted.

34
00:03:02,740 --> 00:03:05,230
He challenged the king's authority.

35
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,290
He will be held in contempt against His Majesty, which is as grave a crime as treason.

36
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:15,440
No way. The king will save him. The king will help.

37
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,130
If the king sides with Grand Prince Jin Seong only because he's his younger brother,

38
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:23,970
that will diminish the king's authority. Other royal family members will gain power.

39
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:28,710
Some might plan for treason by putting the Grand Prince Jin Seong at the forefront.

40
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:36,950
Thus, His Majesty will cut ties with the Grand Prince Jin Seong.

41
00:03:39,050 --> 00:03:43,750
That's what it means to be the king, and it is the weight of the throne.

42
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:52,530
 Queen for Seven Days 

43
00:03:57,180 --> 00:04:01,450
 Think what you will! You won't listen no matter what I say. 

44
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:04,510
 How can I change your thoughts? 

45
00:04:04,510 --> 00:04:08,970
 You must really want to die.  

46
00:04:15,030 --> 00:04:16,960
Why did you do that?

47
00:04:17,980 --> 00:04:19,910
Royal Mother.

48
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:28,250
Stop the nonsense about how an innocent man is being killed.

49
00:04:28,250 --> 00:04:30,960
Why did you go so far to do this?

50
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,860
I don't really know.

51
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:42,200
I found myself here when I came to my senses.

52
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:45,420
I was only focused on one thing at the time.

53
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:50,740
That if I overlook or run away from this,

54
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,670
I will never be able to face those friends.

55
00:04:54,670 --> 00:05:00,350
I won't be able to lift my head from shame.

56
00:05:00,350 --> 00:05:06,160
At least, I should take responsibility for my actions.

57
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,420
Friends? That peasant's son and Sin Soo Geun's daughter?

58
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,600
Royal Mother.

59
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:19,320
Alright. You just wanted to put your best foot forward to your potential betrothed

60
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,320
and acted on impulse.

61
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:27,420
Since those things seem to matter the most at your age.

62
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:33,300
You couldn't catch the scribe? The bait was too big for

63
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:35,830
a trap meant to catch the Grand Prince.

64
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:39,850
As long as the Grand Prince is gone, even if the scribe brings forth the King's secret order,

65
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:44,070
or even if the late king is resurrected from the grave,

66
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:45,950
what use will that be?

67
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:49,460
For what you say to be true,

68
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:55,530
we must kill the Grand Prince Jin Seong this time.

69
00:05:56,660 --> 00:06:00,090
Did you come up with a way to do so?

70
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:07,760
Yes. I will petition the king to save Grand Prince Jin Seong.

71
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:13,680
I will leak the news to palace maids, eunuchs, palace maids-in-training,

72
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:18,120
palace servants, and all the court ladies as well.

73
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,670
Of course, the Queen Dowager will be the first one to make a move.

74
00:06:21,670 --> 00:06:26,280
 Your Majesty, please take it into consideration! 

75
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,640
The king will think the court officials are advocating for Grand Prince Jin Seong.

76
00:06:33,260 --> 00:06:38,230
 All of these are petitions asking for Yeok's forgiveness? 

77
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:42,230
In the end, the king will want to kill him.

78
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:58,000
I would like to add one more person. Sin Soo Geun's daughter.

79
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:05,480
Chief Royal Secretary's wings need to be clipped as well.

80
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:09,230
I will follow your order.

81
00:07:24,070 --> 00:07:27,830
 I have to end this matter and buy time for him to escape. 

82
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,790
 H-how? 

83
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,030
 By my method. 

84
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:34,660
   As the king's younger brother he committed an action that can never be permitted. 

85
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:38,810
 He will be held in contempt against the person of His Majesty, which is as grave a crime as treason. 

86
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:42,870
 Father, I am sorry. 

87
00:07:42,870 --> 00:07:47,880
 My head understands what you said, but my heart doesn't. 

88
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,570
Why are you here?

89
00:07:54,570 --> 00:07:57,680
I am from the Chief Royal Secretary's house.

90
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,760
I am the daughter of Chief Royal Secretary Sin Soo Geun

91
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,750
and the niece of the Queen Dowager.

92
00:08:05,750 --> 00:08:07,920
You're Chief Royal Secretary's daughter?

93
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:11,670
Yes, I urgently need to meet Her Highness the Queen.

94
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:21,210
Please pass the message to Her Highness Sook Won.

95
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:24,830
Alright. Since when was she missing?

96
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:28,370
Since the early morning? I think she left at daybreak.

97
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:32,230
 You can't do this, Chae Gyeong. 

98
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:36,930
 Please. You must not act rashly. 

99
00:08:46,600 --> 00:08:50,980
Please listen to our plea.

100
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:55,800
Your Majesty, please listen to our plea.

101
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:59,470
Your Majesty, please listen to our plea.

102
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:01,990
It's been three days already.

103
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:07,230
Your Majesty, please listen to our plea.

104
00:09:28,730 --> 00:09:30,800
Oh, Your Majesty.

105
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,280
Who are you?

106
00:09:40,200 --> 00:09:42,280
I asked who you are!

107
00:09:49,610 --> 00:09:50,960
Your Majesty.

108
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:54,430
I think I know who she is.

109
00:09:56,750 --> 00:09:59,480
Your Majesty. Your Majesty!

110
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,780
Your Majesty? Warrior.

111
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,160
Here we meet again.

112
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,040
Then, you're—

113
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:20,730
Yes. That's right.

114
00:10:20,730 --> 00:10:24,890
You're really... really...

115
00:10:28,690 --> 00:10:33,720
The king? The king? Your Majesty?

116
00:10:34,550 --> 00:10:37,300
Right. What brings you to the palace?

117
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:43,860
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty! The Grand Prince...

118
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:48,250
Please forgive His Highness the Grand Prince.

119
00:11:00,710 --> 00:11:02,640
Your Highness.

120
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,460
Chief Royal Secretary.

121
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:16,240
I heard you were together with Chae Gyeong during this incident.

122
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,970
Am I right?

123
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,310
You were Yeok's friend?

124
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:35,660
Can you forgive him this once?

125
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,790
Do you think this has happened

126
00:11:38,620 --> 00:11:42,210
because I did not forgive him?

127
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:43,530
That's not it—

128
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,660
Then, do you think this

129
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:51,100
is such a trivial matter in which everything will end with my forgiveness?

130
00:11:51,820 --> 00:11:53,930
N-no, Your Majesty.

131
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:58,370
Then, do you have anything else to say?

132
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:09,900
You want to have a good relationship with your younger brother too.

133
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:14,470
You were tormented that day.

134
00:12:14,470 --> 00:12:17,680
That's why you swam in the cold valley waters.

135
00:12:18,390 --> 00:12:21,820
You did all of that because you cherish His Highness the Grand Prince.

136
00:12:21,820 --> 00:12:24,820
The one who betrayed that trust and effort

137
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,000
was Yeok, that rascal.

138
00:12:36,530 --> 00:12:41,230
These are petitions to His Majesty the King requesting  severe punishment for Chae Gyeong.

139
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:45,100
The contents in these petitions state that what you did was only to help my daughter

140
00:12:45,100 --> 00:12:50,050
and if someone should be punished, Chae Gyeong, who was the initiator, should be punished.

141
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,820
  You said her name was Chae Gyeong, didn't you? 

142
00:12:57,520 --> 00:12:59,030
  That child has nothing to do with this. 

143
00:12:59,030 --> 00:13:03,670
  What nonsense. Tell them that it was all that child's doing. 

144
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:09,030
  Tell them that because she's the daughter of the Chief Royal Secretary, because you were to be wed to her soon, you did as she wished. 

145
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:10,600
  Royal Mother! 

146
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:15,870
  The queen and her relatives will interfere to save that child. 

147
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:19,280
  They'll try to prevent this incident from growing and attempt to bury it. 

148
00:13:20,350 --> 00:13:22,630
  That's how you'll be able to live. 

149
00:13:22,630 --> 00:13:24,660
Royal Mother...

150
00:13:25,690 --> 00:13:30,550
Chae Gyeong has requested an audience with His Majesty the King.

151
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:34,660
I was a step late so I could not stop her.

152
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:41,480
If this goes according to that written appeal, Chae Gyeong will end up being punished in your place.

153
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:45,190
Who said that? Who said I worked with her?

154
00:13:45,190 --> 00:13:48,900
Do you think I would have done this with a mere girl?

155
00:13:48,900 --> 00:13:51,730
Why did she go to meet my brother?!

156
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,250
Why is she meddling with things again, inviting trouble?

157
00:13:55,080 --> 00:13:57,000
I must meet my brother.

158
00:13:57,000 --> 00:14:00,340
Warden! Warden!

159
00:14:00,340 --> 00:14:01,260
Warden!

160
00:14:01,260 --> 00:14:05,670
I am indebted to you, Your Highness.

161
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:08,450
I must meet His Majesty the King.

162
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:10,900
What did you just say?

163
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:16,070
I requested you to punish me too,

164
00:14:16,850 --> 00:14:21,680
so that I can take part of Grand Prince Jin Seong's punishment.

165
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,550
Back then, you promised that you would grant me a wish

166
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:38,540
if we were to ever meet again.

167
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:45,870
If you're planning to use your wish like this, it would be better to wish that I forgive Grand Prince Jin Seong.

168
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:49,070
I want to do that a hundred, a thousand times over,

169
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:51,430
but how can I do that?

170
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:58,570
I can clearly see that you're having a hard time and are in pain,

171
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:01,560
I know that this isn't such a light matter.

172
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:07,590
If I share his punishment,

173
00:15:07,590 --> 00:15:13,470
His Highness the Grand Prince will be less scared and Your Majesty will be less tormented.

174
00:15:15,140 --> 00:15:17,340
You're so pitiful.

175
00:15:22,170 --> 00:15:24,460
Look.

176
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:33,450
Yeok... Grand Prince Jin Seong said that this all happened because of you.

177
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:40,500
Therefore, the ministers, with one mind and heart, are telling me

178
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:45,840
that the Chief Royal Secretary's daughter, Sin Chae Gyeong, should be punished and not Grand Prince Jin Seong.

179
00:15:48,870 --> 00:15:51,670
Is everything truly your doing?

180
00:15:59,430 --> 00:16:01,700
If this is true,

181
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:08,250
then you, your father, and your entire family will have to give up your heads.

182
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:16,700
  Your Majesty, Grand Prince Jin Seong requests to meet you. 

183
00:16:17,510 --> 00:16:19,290
Let him in.

184
00:17:05,310 --> 00:17:09,440
Your Highness, please don't do anything.

185
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:12,460
That's how His Highness the Grand Prince can live.

186
00:17:15,870 --> 00:17:18,600
For what reason did you ask to see me?

187
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,600
I wish for us to talk in private.

188
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:25,870
I heard that child was your friend.

189
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:29,640
Friend?

190
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:32,770
Do you know what I went through because of this girl?

191
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:36,070
She involved herself into each of my affairs and disturbed me.

192
00:17:36,070 --> 00:17:40,030
I shouted at her multiple times to mind her own business and get lost,

193
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,400
yet she stuck on like a leech and made things complicated for me.

194
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,570
We could have quietly overlooked the rice incident too

195
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:52,260
but this girl dug further, leading to this.

196
00:17:52,970 --> 00:17:55,040
Your Highness.

197
00:17:57,900 --> 00:18:00,780
So I told you to mind your own business and get lost!

198
00:18:00,780 --> 00:18:03,960
I told you to never appear in front of me again!

199
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:06,370
Did you think I would be thankful if you did this?

200
00:18:06,370 --> 00:18:10,000
You're just trying to make yourself feel better!

201
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:12,510
Then what about you, Your Highness?!

202
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:16,770
You pushed the blame for something you did onto someone else!

203
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:23,630
Now that I see it, it's true.

204
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,840
Your Highness, you...

205
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:41,080
you're truly planning to push all the blame onto me.

206
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:58,040
Then, did you think I would die alone?

207
00:19:03,740 --> 00:19:08,670
If that's the case, was I deceived?

208
00:19:08,670 --> 00:19:09,930
Yes.

209
00:19:09,930 --> 00:19:12,400
Even though you stopped me,

210
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:14,340
I ignored you and did everything by myself?

211
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:15,970
That's right!

212
00:19:15,970 --> 00:19:19,830
Then, I pushed all the blame onto you?

213
00:19:19,830 --> 00:19:21,110
Didn't you?!

214
00:19:21,110 --> 00:19:23,000
Your Highness!

215
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:41,280


216
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:07,020
Father.

217
00:20:15,110 --> 00:20:19,950
I will put down the title of Grand Prince and all other privileges.

218
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:24,180
I will become a deposed prince.

219
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:29,090
I can live as a nameless warrior in the countryside.

220
00:20:29,090 --> 00:20:34,450
If you order me to enter deep into the mountains and live as a peasant, I will.

221
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:39,520
Please...

222
00:20:41,180 --> 00:20:43,650
please just spare me.

223
00:20:45,800 --> 00:20:48,880
You're going to take the blame alone?

224
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,040
Because this is something I did alone.

225
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,600
Are you expecting me to believe those words?

226
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:59,150
Just up to here,

227
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:03,000
just up to this moment,

228
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:06,610
please believe me.

229
00:21:14,610 --> 00:21:17,840
We greet you, Your Majesty!

230
00:21:29,830 --> 00:21:36,300
Grand Prince Jin Seong and the Royal Chief Secretary's daughter, Sin Chae Gyeong, step forward.

231
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:51,630
Before I decide on Grand Prince Jin Seong's punishment,

232
00:21:51,630 --> 00:21:58,220
I wish to confirm whether Chief Royal Secretary's daughter's, Sin Chae Gyeong, claim is true.

233
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:04,640
According to rumors, both the incident of the embezzlement of rice in the Dongjeokjeon village

234
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:12,320
and the escaped prisoner from the Royal Investigative Bureau are said to be the doings of Sin Chae Gyeong.

235
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:15,500
Is that true?

236
00:22:48,510 --> 00:22:50,230
I...

237
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:54,970
I...

238
00:22:54,970 --> 00:22:58,060
  If this is true, you, your father, 

239
00:22:58,060 --> 00:23:03,230
  and your entire family will have to give up your heads. 

240
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:09,740
Speak the truth. If you do not speak the truth...

241
00:23:10,950 --> 00:23:15,030
  Friend? Do you know what I went through because of this girl? 

242
00:23:15,030 --> 00:23:18,110
  She involved herself into each of my affairs and disturbed me. 

243
00:23:18,110 --> 00:23:21,910
  I shouted at her multiple times to mind her own business and get lost, 

244
00:23:21,910 --> 00:23:25,150
 yet she stuck on like a leech and complicated things for me. 

245
00:23:25,150 --> 00:23:29,440
I don't know! This is something I know nothing about.

246
00:23:36,950 --> 00:23:41,220
I don't know anything.

247
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:46,800
I didn't do anything.

248
00:23:58,490 --> 00:24:02,140
Yes, this is something I did alone.

249
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:13,250
This is something I did. I'll gladly accept the punishment.

250
00:24:14,430 --> 00:24:16,900
Your Highness!

251
00:24:23,590 --> 00:24:25,520
Chief Royal Secretary!

252
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,930
Take your daughter away.

253
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:31,420
Yes, Your Majesty.

254
00:24:50,500 --> 00:24:53,440
It's not true! Why are you lying?!

255
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,160
Chae Gyeong!

256
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:58,200
Your Highness, please don't do this! Father!

257
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:01,970
Let go of me! Let go!

258
00:25:17,670 --> 00:25:21,700
Let go! Let go of me! Let go!

259
00:25:21,700 --> 00:25:23,010
Chae Gyeong!

260
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:25,100
You knew, didn't you?

261
00:25:25,100 --> 00:25:29,900
You knew everything and did this. You're really bad.

262
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:34,690
The Grand Prince, the King, and you, Father, you're all really bad.

263
00:25:34,690 --> 00:25:37,330
Why did you do that?! Why?!

264
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,860
Your Highness the Queen Dowager.

265
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,980
So you're going to survive on your own?

266
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:49,300
You're going to survive on your own after pushing my son into a corner?!

267
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:55,640
I will never forget what happened today.

268
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,930
  When we get married, let's have fun and live like this forever, like friends. 

269
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:54,730
  We can get married. 

270
00:26:54,730 --> 00:27:00,840
  Instead, it's not a political marriage. I'm doing this marriage because I like you. 

271
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:07,110
  It fits perfectly! Just perfect! 

272
00:27:42,890 --> 00:27:45,030
Mother.

273
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:50,150
It's beef I've marinated in seasoning for the past few days.

274
00:27:50,150 --> 00:27:52,940
I personally prepared this.

275
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,620
You don't have to do this.

276
00:27:56,620 --> 00:27:59,390
Don't misunderstand.

277
00:27:59,390 --> 00:28:03,990
This is a meeting we had planned since 2 weeks ago.

278
00:28:03,990 --> 00:28:07,070
  And you kept delaying it. 

279
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:11,000
Sit down and eat.

280
00:28:13,670 --> 00:28:16,000
  Don't do anything. 

281
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:19,340
  That's how His Highness the Grand Prince can survive. 

282
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:38,460
I'll take my leave now, Mother.

283
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:42,680
Alright, Your Majesty.

284
00:28:50,230 --> 00:28:52,200
Please...

285
00:28:53,930 --> 00:28:57,480
I'll make him live quietly, so please!

286
00:28:57,480 --> 00:29:00,570
Just don't kill him, Your Majesty.

287
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,060
So, it seems you think I would

288
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:13,980
kill Yeok?

289
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:26,250
Still, I believed that you were my mother.

290
00:29:28,210 --> 00:29:32,630
Because you raised me, I was attached to you, but...

291
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:41,150
today, I know for certain.

292
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:45,340
You're not.

293
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:54,130
You're only... Yeok's mother.

294
00:29:56,440 --> 00:30:00,100
Your Majesty, it's a misunderstanding. That's not what I meant—

295
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:04,150
Yes, I'll spare him. In return,

296
00:30:07,660 --> 00:30:10,260
our relationship ends here.

297
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:13,900
As mother and son, as older brother and younger brother,

298
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:17,590
I won't hesitate because of our relationship

299
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:22,760
and from now on, I will only live as Joseon's king.

300
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:37,440
Do as you wish,

301
00:30:38,900 --> 00:30:40,610
Your Majesty.

302
00:31:01,690 --> 00:31:06,160
  "No, you're my son too." 

303
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:10,280
  Is it that hard for you to say those few words? 

304
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,710
  Our relationship ends here. 

305
00:31:25,710 --> 00:31:31,800
  From now on, I'll only live as Joseon's king. 

306
00:31:31,800 --> 00:31:35,770
Things won't go as you plan

307
00:31:37,650 --> 00:31:41,550
because I won't stand idly by.

308
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:49,510
You can't do that, Your Majesty. After coming this far, you're going to spare Grand Prince Jin Seong?

309
00:31:49,510 --> 00:31:52,330
He willingly ventured on the path leading to his death.

310
00:31:52,330 --> 00:31:55,770
When will another opportunity like this come again?

311
00:31:57,230 --> 00:32:00,630
You have to execute him.

312
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:09,660
He's right, Your Majesty.

313
00:32:09,660 --> 00:32:14,170
If Grand Prince Jin Seong's punishment is light, unsightly rumors will spread among the council members

314
00:32:14,170 --> 00:32:18,700
and outside of the palace walls.

315
00:32:18,700 --> 00:32:21,270
Rumors?

316
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:26,870
Rumors will spread that Grand Prince Jin Seong was framed and he will receive sympathy votes.

317
00:32:26,870 --> 00:32:32,900
The Grand Prince will become a heroic prince who risked his life for a pitiful peasant.

318
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:37,900
At this point where it wouldn't be enough to make him a traitor, he'll become the main character of a moving story.

319
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:54,080
This time as well, you were able to confirm there is considerable support behind the Grand Prince Jin Seong.

320
00:32:54,080 --> 00:33:00,190
Should I fear them?

321
00:33:01,930 --> 00:33:06,930
I promised I will believe him till here.

322
00:33:06,930 --> 00:33:09,870
I won't go back on my decision.

323
00:33:20,860 --> 00:33:26,090
 Criminal Lee Yeok will be deposed and is ordered to live in Hamgil-do. 

324
00:33:46,270 --> 00:33:48,110
 - One. 
 - One. 

325
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:50,820
 That's right. Left foot first. 

326
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:53,400
 With your right foot forward. Two. 

327
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:58,230
 That's right. Left foot this time. Keep going. 

328
00:34:08,690 --> 00:34:12,250
Can you play the pipa  (Chinese lute) ?

329
00:34:12,250 --> 00:34:18,120
Your lute skills that can crazily bring forth sleep will be quite helpful for my insomnia.

330
00:34:34,810 --> 00:34:36,600
Grand Prince.

331
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:50,220
You must live. You must survive.

332
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:55,370
Royal Mother.

333
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:15,880
Your Highness! Your Highness Grand Prince!

334
00:35:15,880 --> 00:35:19,440
Your Highness! Your Royal Highness, Grand Prince!

335
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:26,460
What were you doing to show up now?

336
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:29,190
No matter how many times we went to the  palace,  they wouldn't let us in.

337
00:35:29,190 --> 00:35:32,660
So why did you make trouble?

338
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,880
So that you may learn from others' mistakes.

339
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:43,680
So behave until I come back.

340
00:35:45,990 --> 00:35:49,300
Your Highness! Your Highness!

341
00:35:49,300 --> 00:35:52,150
Your Highness! Your Highness!

342
00:35:53,950 --> 00:35:58,170
Your Highness, stay healthy.

343
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:02,520
- Stay healthy. 
 - Stay healthy, Your Highness.

344
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,180
Your Royal Highness, Grand Prince!

345
00:36:08,060 --> 00:36:10,080
Chae Gyeong.

346
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:20,170
You are lucky to be alive.

347
00:36:21,890 --> 00:36:26,650
Stop here. Don't see him off.

348
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:32,630
From the beginning, you two were never destined to even meet.

349
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,550
Your Highness!

350
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,820
Your Royal Highness, Grand Prince.

351
00:36:53,860 --> 00:36:57,280
Your Royal Highness, Grand Prince!  Your Royal Highness, Grand Prince!

352
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:00,180
Your Royal Highness, Grand Prince!

353
00:37:13,210 --> 00:37:15,330
Your Royal Highness, Grand Prince!

354
00:37:15,330 --> 00:37:19,540
You surprised me. I thought it was a wild boar.

355
00:37:19,540 --> 00:37:22,570
What should I do?

356
00:37:22,570 --> 00:37:26,290
In order to save you, do I need to bring Seo No's father?

357
00:37:26,290 --> 00:37:29,150
Then... then...

358
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,890
It was Seo No's fault.

359
00:37:32,890 --> 00:37:36,710
He stole. So why did he steal the rice...

360
00:37:40,970 --> 00:37:45,320
What am I saying? Am I a beast or a human?

361
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:51,530
Is there really no other way?

362
00:37:52,820 --> 00:37:58,620
You said you are smart. You said you read many more difficult books than the King did.

363
00:37:58,620 --> 00:38:03,090
So what if you're a prince? You can't even protect your own life.

364
00:38:03,090 --> 00:38:05,620
You're a fool.

365
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:14,230
Who's dying? I am not going to die. I will come back soon.

366
00:38:14,230 --> 00:38:16,460
Do you think I will live there forever?

367
00:38:16,460 --> 00:38:20,750
Still, can you not go?

368
00:38:20,750 --> 00:38:25,480
I will never ask you to interfere with someone else's business.

369
00:38:31,060 --> 00:38:33,490
Can you not go?

370
00:38:53,430 --> 00:38:58,660
You will find the salamander water pot in my desk drawer.

371
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,560
I will give that to you.

372
00:39:03,770 --> 00:39:05,970
Is that a token?

373
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:11,790
Are you promising me that you will return?

374
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:29,100
You must keep this well too.

375
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,770
♫  Without a sound you approached me  ♫

376
00:39:31,770 --> 00:39:34,620
This is my promise.

377
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:38,930
♫  You reached out your hand and smiled  ♫

378
00:39:38,930 --> 00:39:42,480
My promise... that I will wait for you.

379
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:49,150
♫   All the times we spent together   ♫

380
00:39:49,150 --> 00:39:54,810
♫   You are going further away as if I dreamed of it  ♫

381
00:39:56,390 --> 00:40:03,050
♫   Now I can no longer bear the longing that has grown  ♫

382
00:40:03,050 --> 00:40:09,560
♫   Why didn't I know that I loved you  ♫

383
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:17,760
♫   Even though you don't want to leave, must you leave?  ♫

384
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:25,480
♫   Now I know that I can't live without you  ♫

385
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:32,250
♫  Don't go far away so we can meet again  ♫

386
00:40:32,250 --> 00:40:39,340
♫  Once more, I love you, my dear  ♫

387
00:40:40,450 --> 00:40:45,780
♫   Time passes by beyond my control  ♫

388
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:55,000
♫   We gazed at each other and smiled  ♫

389
00:40:55,000 --> 00:41:01,880
♫  One day, will I be able to see you  ♫

390
00:41:10,300 --> 00:41:14,210
Are you crazy? Why did you hide?

391
00:41:42,860 --> 00:41:45,710
 I kept you alive. 

392
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,420
 This is my last act of mercy. 

393
00:41:50,950 --> 00:41:52,530
Who's there?

394
00:41:53,750 --> 00:41:55,640
Your Majesty.

395
00:41:55,640 --> 00:41:57,270
You.

396
00:42:09,780 --> 00:42:12,210
I will be that.

397
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:20,720
Until the Grand Prince returns,

398
00:42:21,770 --> 00:42:29,940
I will be your younger sibling, friend,

399
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:32,600
and family as well.

400
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:36,030
So...

401
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:47,220
let's wait together. The two of us.

402
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:13,330
 This is my promise. 

403
00:43:13,330 --> 00:43:17,150
 My promise... that I will wait for you. 

404
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:42,080
Assassins!

405
00:43:42,080 --> 00:43:43,890
Please escape!

406
00:44:36,210 --> 00:44:37,910
Find him!

407
00:44:49,160 --> 00:44:51,610
You must find him and get rid of him!

408
00:44:58,750 --> 00:45:00,450
He must be near here.

409
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,640
Search thoroughly!

410
00:45:37,280 --> 00:45:39,570
Who are you?! Who sent you?!

411
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:41,350
Tell me!

412
00:45:55,100 --> 00:45:58,180
A royal command? It's a royal command?

413
00:46:03,800 --> 00:46:05,770
 You have to live. 

414
00:46:05,770 --> 00:46:08,330
  You must survive. 

415
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:13,540
  The King is trying to kill you. 

416
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:17,670
  He's trying to kill you because of the secret order the late king left behind. 

417
00:46:17,670 --> 00:46:20,060
  My brother is trying to kill me? 

418
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:24,650
  The late king was planning to appoint you as the king. 

419
00:46:24,650 --> 00:46:29,310
  If we just find the secret order, you could become king. 

420
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:32,850
  Therefore, the King is trying to kill you before that secret order is discovered. 

421
00:46:32,850 --> 00:46:35,990
  He's trying to get rid of your supporters. 

422
00:46:35,990 --> 00:46:38,490
 No matter what I tell you, you won't listen. 

423
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:41,360
  With what power would I change your thoughts, Your Majesty? 

424
00:46:41,360 --> 00:46:46,240
  You must truly want to die. 

425
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:52,010
  Is it really you, Brother? 

426
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:56,540
  Brother, are you trying to kill me? 

427
00:46:57,480 --> 00:47:01,230
  Brother, please tell me it isn't true. 

428
00:47:01,230 --> 00:47:04,520
  Please tell me it's not true, Brother. 

429
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:44,480
- Your Highness the Grand Prince! 
 - Goodness, what should we do?

430
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,560
Young Lady! Young Lady!

431
00:47:46,560 --> 00:47:48,300
- What should I do? 
 - Your Highness!

432
00:47:50,580 --> 00:47:52,440
Goodness, Young Lady!

433
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:12,600
Young Lady!

434
00:48:25,390 --> 00:48:27,280
Your Majesty.

435
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:43,620
Your Majesty!

436
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,340
Give it to me! Where is it?!

437
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:54,090
Exactly where did you hide it?!

438
00:49:54,090 --> 00:49:57,970
What's so great about that secret order?! What's so great about it?!

439
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:02,730
  Brother. Brother. 

440
00:50:05,350 --> 00:50:08,250
  Brother! Brother! Brother! 

441
00:50:53,540 --> 00:50:55,460
Father,

442
00:51:00,030 --> 00:51:05,200
why do you look at me with that expression?

443
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,230
You can't do that.

444
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:12,070
Father, it was you, not me,

445
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:16,630
who killed Yeok.

446
00:51:18,120 --> 00:51:22,360
Father, you killed him!

447
00:52:54,910 --> 00:52:59,680
  Wow, what a nice sight! It's killer! 

448
00:53:05,430 --> 00:53:09,490
I'm sorry, Your Highness the Grand Prince.

449
00:53:11,750 --> 00:53:12,640
What about this one?

450
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:16,530
- That one is two nyang. 
 - Give it to me for one nyang.

451
00:53:16,530 --> 00:53:19,000
  Goodness, what are you saying? 

452
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:20,780
  I'm going to give this to His Majesty the King. 

453
00:53:20,780 --> 00:53:23,100
  How? 

454
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:24,840
  I'm His Majesty the King's nephew! 

455
00:53:24,840 --> 00:53:26,590
  I'm His Majesty the King's younger brother! 

456
00:53:26,590 --> 00:53:31,430
  Yeah, right! If you're the King's younger brother, I'm... 

457
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:35,900
  I'm Joseon's queen! 

458
00:53:48,970 --> 00:53:53,940
I'm sorry, Your Highness.

459
00:54:10,480 --> 00:54:13,020
  Place the salamander into the jar, 

460
00:54:13,020 --> 00:54:17,190
 cover it with a leaf, and wet the branch of a willow. 

461
00:54:17,190 --> 00:54:20,690
  Salamander! Salamander! 

462
00:54:20,690 --> 00:54:25,430
  I don't think you two belong here. Hurry and return to your homes. 

463
00:54:41,580 --> 00:54:46,380
Your Highness Grand Prince, I'm sorry.

464
00:54:47,970 --> 00:54:50,890
For making you receive the punishment alone,

465
00:54:53,420 --> 00:54:56,070
I'm sorry.

466
00:54:56,070 --> 00:54:59,880
For needlessly meddling into your life,

467
00:55:01,990 --> 00:55:04,020
I'm sorry.

468
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:10,080
For causing you to d-die,

469
00:55:18,790 --> 00:55:21,910
I'm really, truly sorry...

470
00:55:23,360 --> 00:55:27,420
  We can get married. It's not a political marriage. 

471
00:55:27,420 --> 00:55:30,090
  I'm doing this marriage because I like you. 

472
00:56:10,250 --> 00:56:13,860
  5 years later, 1504 

473
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:26,010
The bride is leaving her home.

474
00:56:26,010 --> 00:56:27,460
It's so nice!

475
00:56:28,430 --> 00:56:34,120
Light the candles for the bride and groom.

476
00:56:40,070 --> 00:56:44,350
What's wrong with you? What's wrong with you now?

477
00:56:47,000 --> 00:56:51,150
Hey, are you doing that because you don't want me to get married?

478
00:56:51,150 --> 00:56:56,990
Once I get married today, you'll be the sole old maid in the village.

479
00:56:56,990 --> 00:56:59,310
What are you saying?!

480
00:57:02,760 --> 00:57:08,190
Young Lady! Goodness! If someone saw you, they'd think you just came back from causing a ruckus at someone else's wedding.

481
00:57:08,190 --> 00:57:10,670
Why do you look like that?

482
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:13,970
Here, here, here!

483
00:57:13,970 --> 00:57:16,350
Another letter from Hanyang?

484
00:57:16,350 --> 00:57:19,770
Who is it this time? Mother? Father? Uncle?

485
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:22,070
Someone of higher rank.

486
00:57:24,630 --> 00:57:29,530
I guess it's Aunt. Her Highness the Queen has finally sprung into action.

487
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,470
That's why you should get married!

488
00:57:32,470 --> 00:57:38,500
If Her Highness the Queen has to give an order, then there's nothing to avoid anymore.

489
00:57:38,500 --> 00:57:39,720
- Nanny.
- Goodness.

490
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:43,260
You improved so much on your Hanyang dialect. You're better than me.

491
00:57:43,260 --> 00:57:46,630
Really? I'm a fast learner at everything—

492
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:50,140
What am I saying right now? Don't change the subject!

493
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:08,680
That promise is now void.

494
00:58:08,680 --> 00:58:13,400
How can you still be waiting for him like this after you attended his funeral?

495
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:17,560
Who said I was waiting?

496
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:22,730
I don't have any thoughts of living as a ghost's wife either.

497
00:58:23,970 --> 00:58:27,110
Then why do you refuse all of those eligible bachelors

498
00:58:27,110 --> 00:58:31,320
and remain buried here in Geochang, away from everything, being humiliated at others' weddings

499
00:58:31,320 --> 00:58:36,420
and playing the role of the veterinarian? I really don't know why you do that.

500
00:58:52,530 --> 00:58:55,710
Please make sure to succeed this time!

501
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,970
  Who's dying? I won't die. 

502
00:59:11,970 --> 00:59:14,630
  I'm going to return soon. 

503
00:59:16,420 --> 00:59:21,170
Yeah, the pond didn't commit any crime. Right?

504
00:59:35,980 --> 00:59:38,960
Why is it raining suddenly?

505
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:01,350
Move, bastards!

506
01:00:01,350 --> 01:00:03,990
Hurry! Hurry up!

507
01:00:03,990 --> 01:00:05,360
Hurry up!

508
01:00:05,360 --> 01:00:08,450
Hurry up and move!

509
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:10,800
Throw away anything that adds considerable weight!

510
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,090
Do you want this ship to sink?

511
01:00:18,450 --> 01:00:20,150
Hurry!

512
01:00:20,150 --> 01:00:21,680
Yes, sir!

513
01:00:23,430 --> 01:00:26,060
Drag all of them out!

514
01:00:42,070 --> 01:00:44,220
Come out! Come on!

515
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:49,740
Let go of me! Let go!

516
01:01:02,630 --> 01:01:05,860
Throw them overboard!

517
01:01:05,860 --> 01:01:07,530
Yes, sir!

518
01:01:10,870 --> 01:01:17,010
Hey! I think he's the heaviest among us.

519
01:02:24,380 --> 01:02:26,590
Who are you?

520
01:02:41,390 --> 01:02:45,650
  Who are you? Who sent you?! Tell me! 

521
01:02:46,600 --> 01:02:49,250
Do you remember?

522
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:53,340
I'll be sad if you don't remember.

523
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:56,660
What?

524
01:03:12,060 --> 01:03:14,010
Grand Prince!

525
01:03:18,570 --> 01:03:20,780
Your Highness the Grand Prince!

526
01:03:21,750 --> 01:03:24,120
Your Highness the Grand Prince! Your Highness the Grand Prince!

527
01:03:52,260 --> 01:03:59,390


528
01:04:00,180 --> 01:04:00,200
♫   If I told you that I love you,   ♫
