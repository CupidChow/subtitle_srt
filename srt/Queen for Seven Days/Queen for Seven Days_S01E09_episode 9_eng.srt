1
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:44,180
  Episode 9 

2
00:00:44,770 --> 00:00:46,700
Who are you?

3
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:50,100
I asked, who are you?

4
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,590
I'm Lee Yeok.

5
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:56,830
Hyungnim, it's me.

6
00:00:59,690 --> 00:01:01,720
I have returned.

7
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:09,710


8
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:19,570
Have you been well?

9
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:43,740
You were alive. You were alive!

10
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:03,700
Quickly, move her to the royal infirmary.

11
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,730
My younger brother, whom I thought was dead, has returned. What are you all doing?!

12
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:25,260
We greet Your Highness the Grand Prince!

13
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,660
We greet Your Highness the Grand Prince!

14
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:40,260
You're still all the same. Oh, my lord.

15
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:42,930
My lord, you've been promoted?

16
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:44,780
Yes, Your Highness.

17
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:48,790
Congratulations. Five years have passed, and you haven't aged at all.

18
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:52,860
Your Highness, I welcome your return to the palace.

19
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:55,680
I was grateful for the medicine you received from Ming.

20
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:57,440
You still remember that?

21
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,090
Of course.

22
00:02:59,090 --> 00:03:03,690
Now, now, now! Everyone, get up! How long has it been?

23
00:03:06,270 --> 00:03:08,000
Quickly, call the royal physician.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,100
Yes, Your Highness.

25
00:03:14,610 --> 00:03:18,770
Therefore, please relieve Young Lady Sin and I of our false charges.

26
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,680
The behavior of the Office of Procurement, of throwing people overboard in times when the ship tilts,

27
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:27,670
I could not just sit and watch, isn't that so?

28
00:03:31,270 --> 00:03:35,940
Officers from the Office of Procurement wouldn't have committed such reckless acts.

29
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:40,820
I don't think this is something to decide on lightly without any evidence.

30
00:03:40,820 --> 00:03:42,840
Then,

31
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,660
you cornered Young Lady Sin into being the culprit, locked her in a cell,

32
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:53,670
and even forwarded that crime onto her family members without any evidence. How will you explain that?

33
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,230
The real thief

34
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,070
is among the ministers here.

35
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:20,560
Thief, Your Highness?! Aren't your words too harsh?

36
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:33,730
Here, here,

37
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:39,290
up to here, these are the recorded royal offerings from Samnam.

38
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,250
So much.

39
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:44,490
But,

40
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:49,000
this, this, and starting from this

41
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:52,900
all the way to here,

42
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,710
the owner is unknown.

43
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:03,450
Headgear embroidered in gold thread, a sleeveless robe, a four-sided robe.

44
00:05:03,450 --> 00:05:08,910
Aren't these things used in celebrating first birthdays? Among the ministers here,

45
00:05:08,910 --> 00:05:14,230
is there anyone who recently celebrated the first birthday of a grandson or a son born in your later years?

46
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:17,450
Isn't someone who dared to take advantage of the royal command

47
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:22,170
to exploit the people the real thief?

48
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:30,140
Why would someone who dared to use a royal command for private ownership be here?

49
00:05:30,140 --> 00:05:34,770
It must be the disorganized act of provincial officials while transporting them.

50
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:38,800
I'll be sure to find the culprits and punish them to the full extent of the law.

51
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:40,620
Whom do you believe

52
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,670
those people believed in to commit this act?

53
00:05:46,290 --> 00:05:50,680
I'll investigate that too.

54
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:55,720
Then, wasn't it the doing of Your Highness the Grand Prince, on the minister's repositories?

55
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:57,560
Repositories?

56
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:07,680
 There is no need to hold resentment since even the King was robbed. 

57
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:14,410
Out of all things... well, someone who uses a royal command for private ownership

58
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:16,940
wouldn't be afraid of a mere grand prince.

59
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,640
Then this rascal is playing around with the nation, isn't he?

60
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,590
Listen up!

61
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:31,970
Grand Prince Jin Seong was unexpectedly framed as the thief who stole the royal offerings

62
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:37,700
and because of that, the First Vice Premier's daughter, Young Lady Sin, suffered a great deal.

63
00:06:37,700 --> 00:06:41,380
Announce to the world that Grand Prince Jin Seong and Young Lady Sin are innocent,

64
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:46,600
fix the incorrect truth, and adequately compensate Young Lady Sin who has

65
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:49,670
suffered from this ordeal.

66
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:59,720
And the thief that impersonated Grand Prince Jin Seong,

67
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:06,800
Chief Royal Secretary, take responsibility for it and work with the Bureau of Punishment

68
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:09,590
to make sure you arrest him.

69
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:13,570
I'll carry out your order, Your Majesty.

70
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:26,520
Get up, First Vice Premier. His Majesty has ordered clemency.

71
00:07:41,750 --> 00:07:43,890
Your Highness the Grand Prince.

72
00:07:43,890 --> 00:07:46,760
You're headed towards the royal infirmary.

73
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:49,650
Her Highness the Queen Dowager's quarters are this way.

74
00:08:01,710 --> 00:08:07,870
Your Majesty, everything Grand Prince Jin Seong said in the council hall was a lie.

75
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:11,930
What do you mean by coincidence? What was unintended?

76
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:16,630
Grand Prince Jin Seong did not return without a reason—

77
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:24,530
You have just died. What was your crime?

78
00:08:24,530 --> 00:08:27,030
I-I discredited your

79
00:08:27,030 --> 00:08:30,910
credibility in front of your subjects—

80
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:37,430
You have just died again. What was your crime?

81
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:45,570
I disobeyed a direct royal command and harmed Grand Prince Jin Seong—

82
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,720
You have just died again.

83
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,340
I am guilty of allowing Grand Prince Jin Seong to return alive.

84
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,860
Therefore, live as if you were dead.

85
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,710
Don't act up anymore.

86
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:12,570
Your Majesty!

87
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:24,700
Do you have to truly die to come to your senses?!

88
00:09:28,630 --> 00:09:33,510
Your Majesty, I cannot die like this.

89
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:36,500
You know there is something I have not been able to finish!

90
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,850
It's something no one else can do except for me!

91
00:09:40,850 --> 00:09:46,170
Your Majesty, you cannot abandon me!

92
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:49,300
Your Majesty!

93
00:09:55,400 --> 00:10:00,070
Are you planning on disobeying me?

94
00:10:00,070 --> 00:10:06,080
I didn't know you would return  so readily to save that mere child.

95
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,800
All of those years I've spent holding it in seem to have been in vain now.

96
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:13,580
Mother.

97
00:10:14,270 --> 00:10:19,040
Yes, if you have something you want to say, then say it. I just don't—

98
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,770
Can't you hug me, just once?

99
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:32,230
If not, I will hug you.

100
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:54,800
See? We're able to be together like this.

101
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,870
Isn't it nice?

102
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:24,400
There will be good things ahead of us.

103
00:11:26,530 --> 00:11:28,460
I, your son,

104
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:33,750
will make sure that happens.

105
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,990
Please don't cry.

106
00:11:58,590 --> 00:12:02,860
Even so, you still made a reckless decision.

107
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:06,000
This isn't only because of Chae Gyeong.

108
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:10,380
My brother seemed to be aware of my true identity.

109
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:15,710
I decided that just running away and hiding

110
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:18,820
would make the situation for the people around me more dangerous.

111
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:23,650
My brother and the Chief Royal Secretary will do anything to drag me down.

112
00:12:23,650 --> 00:12:29,310
However, keeping you in check will get worse from here on out. Is there any way?

113
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:34,990
I'm going to  use my brother's people for my own benefit.

114
00:12:34,990 --> 00:12:37,860
Hire a spy?

115
00:12:37,860 --> 00:12:42,440
Yes, that's right,  Sire. Once you catch the right fish,

116
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:47,200
you'll be able to get rid of Grand Prince Jin Seong for sure.

117
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,050
Hiring a spy is the perfect way to make that happen.

118
00:12:52,010 --> 00:12:56,540
We have just the right person for that.

119
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:58,460
Who is it?

120
00:12:59,070 --> 00:13:02,880
It's Sin Chae Gyeong, the daughter of the First Vice Premier.

121
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:08,350
What did you just say?

122
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:10,480
Your Highness!

123
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:16,330
I would like to marry Chae Gyeong.

124
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:22,650
Chae Gyeong.

125
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,840
Are you feeling a little better now?

126
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:34,810
Is the Grand Prince truly back?

127
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,660
Stay put until your father gets here.

128
00:13:51,830 --> 00:13:54,420
There's something I must tell you.

129
00:13:56,840 --> 00:13:59,700
Isn't this what you wanted, Mother?

130
00:13:59,700 --> 00:14:03,590
If I become the son-in-law of  my brother's most trusted subordinate,

131
00:14:03,590 --> 00:14:06,100
I will be able to break free from by brother's constant monitoring.

132
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:09,220
However, the situation has changed now.

133
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:14,330
Of course, it has.  The power of the First Vice Premier

134
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:16,500
has become even stronger than before.

135
00:14:16,500 --> 00:14:19,590
Not only has his relationship with the King become even closer,

136
00:14:19,590 --> 00:14:23,540
but he also has intimate relations with the officials holding military power.

137
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:27,730
So, I will get married to Chae Gyeong

138
00:14:28,710 --> 00:14:32,530
and bring the First Vice Premier to my side instead.

139
00:14:35,140 --> 00:14:38,660
Who knows? The First Vice Premier just might

140
00:14:39,790 --> 00:14:43,410
be on his daughter's side instead of his sister's?

141
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:45,340
That's impossible.

142
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,450
I can't use Chae Gyeong like that.

143
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,020
Or we can find a suitable bride for Grand Prince Jin Seong

144
00:14:55,020 --> 00:14:59,510
among the daughters of the other officials instead.

145
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:02,040
However,

146
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:07,210
would you be able to trust them as much as the First Vice Premier?

147
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,120
Are the gifts to be sent to the Queen Dowager's quarters ready?

148
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:14,590
Yes, Your Majesty.

149
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,740
We should give a congratulatory message to the Queen Dowager first, right?

150
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:26,090
All you want to do is protect that girl Sin Chae Gyeong, that's all.

151
00:15:26,090 --> 00:15:28,810
It's because protecting her is more advantageous.

152
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:33,470
The most beneficial thing to do is finding the secret order.

153
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:38,160
Your Highness.

154
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:47,930
Queen—

155
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:54,090
All the officials of the court and the people of this nation will follow the orders of the late king.

156
00:15:54,090 --> 00:15:57,300
So right now, finding the missing scribe

157
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,660
and knowing about the secret order is the wisest thing to do.

158
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:04,460
And on top of that, the scribe is Seo No's father.

159
00:16:06,190 --> 00:16:11,000
- If Seo No just reveals his father's whereabouts—
- Shh!

160
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:56,290
Hyungnim.

161
00:17:00,730 --> 00:17:03,760
We greet you, Your Majesty.

162
00:17:03,760 --> 00:17:08,570
Did I interrupt you while you were having fun?

163
00:17:08,570 --> 00:17:13,790
No, Your Majesty. I just gave my greetings to the Queen Dowager and the Grand Prince

164
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:17,140
and was just about to leave.

165
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:19,360
Your niece, right?

166
00:17:19,360 --> 00:17:22,370
My name is Myeong Hye from the Yoon clan, Your Majesty.

167
00:17:23,710 --> 00:17:26,300
Carry on, Your Majesty.

168
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:56,140
I wonder how much the King heard.

169
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,800
Ever since the Grand Prince almost died,

170
00:17:58,800 --> 00:18:01,800
he has been very quick to react to the smallest thing.

171
00:18:01,800 --> 00:18:06,920
I'm sure the King noticed already when he entered the hallway.

172
00:18:16,070 --> 00:18:19,070
Getting married to the girl from the Sin family?

173
00:18:19,070 --> 00:18:22,470
We're practically giving away everything we've worked for.

174
00:18:23,410 --> 00:18:25,940
That's fine by me.

175
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:29,100
Because in the end, I'll be one

176
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:32,290
to get the last laugh.

177
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:38,100
That's true. The war between the King and the Grand Prince has already begun.

178
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:42,470
Try to endure it all so we can win.

179
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:49,340
Yes, sir. However, I won't be able to endure forever.

180
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:53,620
We must become the leader of the coup. So after we succeed,

181
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,940
we can boldly demand the shares we deserve.

182
00:18:56,940 --> 00:19:01,520
That's right. Now I shall slowly but surely

183
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,100
make a full blown appearance then.

184
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:09,830
Grand Prince Lee Yeok, who was exiled to Hamgil Province,

185
00:19:09,830 --> 00:19:15,530
is forgiven for the crime of helping a criminal escape in the past and for all of the offenses

186
00:19:15,530 --> 00:19:20,080
and  all of  his rights and everything that belonged to him will be restored to him.

187
00:19:34,130 --> 00:19:37,270
My gratitude to you, Your Majesty.

188
00:19:43,430 --> 00:19:46,970
Are you that happy, Queen Dowager?

189
00:19:46,970 --> 00:19:52,170
Of course I am. This is all thanks to you, Your Majesty. Thank you, Your Majesty.

190
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:59,000
Don't mention it. You're in peace now that you don't have to hide it anymore, right?

191
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:05,420
Yes. When the Grand Prince died

192
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:09,640
I couldn't even mourn to my heart's content because I didn't want to trouble you.

193
00:20:09,640 --> 00:20:12,830
And I had a hard time hiding my true feelings.

194
00:20:12,830 --> 00:20:16,860
But now that he has come back safe and sound,

195
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:21,260
I'm not going to shy away from it and plan to be happy to my heart's content.

196
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:23,640
Of course,  you should.

197
00:20:23,640 --> 00:20:25,500
Hey there!

198
00:20:33,670 --> 00:20:38,960
This is a gift from me to you and Yeok.

199
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:44,830
You're so considerate!

200
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:48,060
When did you prepare all of this?

201
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:56,850
What is all of this, Hyungnim?

202
00:20:56,850 --> 00:20:59,770
I'm honored.

203
00:21:01,870 --> 00:21:06,310
Now, I feel as if being born as your younger brother was not in vain.

204
00:21:06,310 --> 00:21:10,910
No, should I say returning from the dead was not in vain?

205
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:16,560
Grand Prince, how can you speak such crass and vulgar words?

206
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:21,890
Yes! From now on, live doing everything you couldn't do before.

207
00:21:21,890 --> 00:21:24,870
I'll make sure you're able to do so.

208
00:21:25,530 --> 00:21:28,210
Your grace is immeasurable.

209
00:21:40,070 --> 00:21:42,330
Would you like to have a drink with me?

210
00:21:44,110 --> 00:21:45,830
A drink?

211
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,270
Of course.

212
00:21:49,270 --> 00:21:54,130
I will head right on over after stopping by the Council Hall, so go and wait at the Green Dew Pavilion.

213
00:21:54,130 --> 00:21:55,640
Yes.

214
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:07,280
Don't ever bring up the secret order again.

215
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,230
Did you forget that because of that mere secret order,

216
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:15,620
he suspected me, was on his guard,

217
00:22:17,090 --> 00:22:20,680
and even tried to kill me?

218
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,880
Yeok.

219
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:26,120
I don't want to risk my fate on that secret order.

220
00:22:28,300 --> 00:22:34,630
Although it will take some time, I will take the throne with my own strength.

221
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:39,000
So, you plan on proceeding with that marriage?

222
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:40,720
Yes.

223
00:22:52,290 --> 00:22:55,620
Do you remember that?

224
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:57,100
Yes.

225
00:22:58,740 --> 00:23:00,770
Take it out and read it.

226
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:05,530
This is the reason we hid you in Geochang when you were young.

227
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:23,140
 Chae Gyeong will bring to the royal family... 

228
00:23:30,960 --> 00:23:33,490
Since His Highness the Grand Prince returned alive,

229
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:36,470
I decided that I must  tell you before it's too late.

230
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:43,700
Chae Gyeong, now, you must escape from this evil fortune by yourself.

231
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:00,600
How did it go?

232
00:24:00,600 --> 00:24:02,860
It's not something that'll work at once.

233
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:05,670
For now, return to your residence.

234
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:08,820
He will soon summon you.

235
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:15,120
My Lord.

236
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:30,170
Since the Grand Prince returned, I fear that you and I squabbling over whom is to blame for what responsibility

237
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:33,800
will disturb His Majesty's mind and court his anger,

238
00:24:33,800 --> 00:24:37,420
so I will overlook this incident just this once.

239
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:42,360
May you regard your life as having been spared once,

240
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:48,400
and from now on, please serve His Majesty with your full allegiance and not become a problem to him.

241
00:24:50,450 --> 00:24:53,030
You render me speechless.

242
00:24:53,030 --> 00:24:58,230
Your daughter was the one who created this chaos.

243
00:24:58,230 --> 00:25:02,790
How can you blame me for everything?

244
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,400
Head Eunuch.

245
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:02,880
Reassign the task of overseeing tribute goods from the Chief Royal Secretary to the First Vice Premier.

246
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,930
And tell him to assist the First Vice Premier.

247
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,660
Yes, Your Majesty.

248
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:11,050
And as you commanded, I have set up the wine table at Green Dew Pavilion.

249
00:26:29,930 --> 00:26:33,470
It's already been two hours since we laid out the wine table.

250
00:26:33,470 --> 00:26:34,790
This won't do.

251
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:39,060
I'll tell His Highness the Grand Prince that His Majesty will be late—

252
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:40,820
Seriously!

253
00:26:40,820 --> 00:26:44,370
How will you live as an eunuch if you're that dense?

254
00:26:46,060 --> 00:26:51,460
I prodded around a bit and it seems His Majesty is training His Highness the Grand Prince.

255
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:52,730
Training?

256
00:26:52,730 --> 00:26:54,660
Putting everything else aside,

257
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:58,390
if the King tells you to wait, then it is the duty of the subject to wait,

258
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,540
whether it's a two hour period or an entire day!

259
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:33,810
I'll give it to you.

260
00:27:36,420 --> 00:27:38,000
Your Majesty.

261
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:51,410
Back then, when I met you at the tavern,

262
00:27:51,410 --> 00:27:55,180
I freaked out thinking I was going to get caught.

263
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:59,740
I pretended I wasn't, like this.

264
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:01,570
You were completely fooled, weren't you?

265
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:05,740
Of course I was fooled! I couldn't have imagined that that cheerful and cute young boy

266
00:28:05,740 --> 00:28:09,100
would have turned out this disgusting.

267
00:28:09,100 --> 00:28:13,350
Now, you've become an adult.

268
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:19,380
I sincerely wished you wouldn't have become an adult.

269
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:25,620
  Because when I become an adult, you'll have to hand the throne over to me. 

270
00:28:25,620 --> 00:28:30,670
Who do you think tried to kill you?

271
00:28:30,670 --> 00:28:32,780
Of course, that would be...

272
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,390
bandits.

273
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:40,330
Who else could it be?

274
00:28:40,330 --> 00:28:43,520
After returning from the dead,

275
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:46,490
this world has become so unfair.

276
00:28:46,490 --> 00:28:52,930
I want to capture those who tried to kill me and exact my revenge,

277
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:58,650
but since this is a life I had trouble regaining,

278
00:28:58,650 --> 00:29:02,520
I don't want to waste my precious time with resentment and anger.

279
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,870
My feelings change countless times per day.

280
00:29:09,130 --> 00:29:12,070
"It would have been better if I had just died,"

281
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,900
haven't you ever had those thoughts?

282
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:22,200
I heard that people tend to think those thoughts when they become quite tormented.

283
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:24,120
Of course I did.

284
00:29:26,260 --> 00:29:28,130
I did.

285
00:29:29,400 --> 00:29:34,790
But recently, I discovered I wanted to live again.

286
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:39,330
Furthermore, I even have a trivial dream.

287
00:29:39,330 --> 00:29:40,690
A dream?

288
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,170
Yes.

289
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:49,120
I want to become strong so I can protect myself and those who are precious to me.

290
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,390
So, did you achieve that dream?

291
00:29:53,390 --> 00:29:55,530
It'll take a while to achieve it.

292
00:29:55,530 --> 00:30:00,160
I've barely just regained my title.

293
00:30:00,160 --> 00:30:05,800
I'm sure the title of "Grand Prince" isn't that trivial.

294
00:30:10,470 --> 00:30:12,440
Of course!

295
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:16,920
My older brother is the king of Joseon.

296
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:21,560
Ah, you must keep all of the promises you made earlier.

297
00:30:31,900 --> 00:30:36,560
Yes, what do you want the most?

298
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:40,850
Sin Chae Gyeong.

299
00:30:43,110 --> 00:30:45,930
I want Chae Gyeong.

300
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,270
Out of all things, why her?

301
00:30:52,270 --> 00:30:54,690
I like Chae Gyeong.

302
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:59,900
I wish to be together with her.

303
00:31:08,550 --> 00:31:11,410
You're leaving already?

304
00:31:11,410 --> 00:31:14,440
It's been a while since I've drank in a good mood;

305
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:17,200
I've already reached my tolerance.

306
00:31:23,870 --> 00:31:25,930
Your Majesty.

307
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:52,040
Hey, Seo No! What are you doing?

308
00:31:52,040 --> 00:31:55,010
Come have a drink. Hey!

309
00:31:55,010 --> 00:32:00,560
Did the grand plan you carried out amount to diverting me, tailing our guild, and reclaiming the royal offerings?

310
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,660
The grand method you chose

311
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:06,030
was to announce to the world that Grand Prince Jin Seong is alive.

312
00:32:06,030 --> 00:32:11,250
- We tried to stop him too—
- "Hiding is not the only solution"

313
00:32:11,250 --> 00:32:13,850
is what Yeok said and I just followed.

314
00:32:13,850 --> 00:32:18,040
Thanks to that, we saved people who were unjustly framed.

315
00:32:18,040 --> 00:32:23,540
If the situation changes, the method can change accordingly.

316
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:30,920
Is that method a mere marriage?

317
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:34,900
I don't like his idea of using Young Lady Chae Gyeong either.

318
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:38,750
- Then? 
 - But I will not oppose it either.

319
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,250
Why?

320
00:32:40,250 --> 00:32:44,420
Because those two cannot enter a political marriage anyway.

321
00:32:44,420 --> 00:32:49,880
Those two will come to sincerely love each other.

322
00:32:53,570 --> 00:32:57,290
If that's not the case, what will you do?

323
00:32:57,290 --> 00:33:03,160
I don't have to do anything. They will definitely end up falling in love.

324
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,880
  If Chae Gyeong meets a person of the royal family, 

325
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:15,660
  it will spark a bloodbath among the court and the royal family. 

326
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,530
  Please do not forget my prediction. 

327
00:33:17,530 --> 00:33:19,480
Nonsense.

328
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:20,970
 Chae Gyeong will make the royal family... 

329
00:33:32,750 --> 00:33:35,470
Come here!

330
00:33:35,470 --> 00:33:37,520
Who is that?

331
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:44,040
Chae Gyeong!

332
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:51,840
Nanny, tell him I'm sleeping. Tell him I can't meet him because I'm still sick.

333
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,130
Stand guard and don't allow anyone to enter.

334
00:33:54,130 --> 00:33:56,390
Why are you giving me such a difficult task?

335
00:33:56,390 --> 00:33:59,290
But I can't lie.

336
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,980
Promise me you won't scream.

337
00:34:36,830 --> 00:34:38,900
Then, I'll let you go.

338
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,440
Nanny—

339
00:35:05,650 --> 00:35:09,980
Seems like you're all recovered. Seeing how you're lying about being asleep too.

340
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,440
Please leave.

341
00:35:17,930 --> 00:35:20,330
Are you not happy to see me?

342
00:35:21,530 --> 00:35:23,090
Yes. I'm unhappy.

343
00:35:23,090 --> 00:35:24,890
Why?

344
00:35:27,550 --> 00:35:30,640
- Chae Gyeong—
- Because I can't trust you!

345
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:33,760
Everything you say is a lie!

346
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,970
At the tavern where we first met, at the pawn shop, at the grave, and in the cave.

347
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:45,250
So I do not wish to see you again. Please leave.

348
00:36:13,080 --> 00:36:19,180
Alright, at the tavern where we first met, at the pawn shop,

349
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:24,560
at the grave, and in the cave, I lied.

350
00:36:28,540 --> 00:36:32,130
The biggest lie among all of the lies I've told

351
00:36:32,130 --> 00:36:34,980
is that I didn't miss you.

352
00:36:40,590 --> 00:36:42,820
I missed you...

353
00:36:46,210 --> 00:36:50,030
a lot. 
 ♫   Suddenly, the whole world   ♫

354
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:53,870
Very much. 
 ♫   is filled by you   ♫

355
00:36:54,940 --> 00:36:57,070
♫   Suddenly, you were there without a sound  ♫

356
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:59,340
After telling me that there were no more promises left between us,

357
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:01,370
after returning the token to me and leaving,

358
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:03,580
why are you telling me this now?!

359
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,470
♫   The first moment I saw you, I was so nervous   ♫

360
00:37:05,470 --> 00:37:08,410
Exactly why did you return? 
 ♫   I couldn't bring myself to look at your eyes   ♫

361
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:13,220
What do you mean? Don't you remember what I said afterwards? 
 ♫   What do I do now   ♫

362
00:37:13,220 --> 00:37:16,010
♫   when my breath is about to stop?   ♫

363
00:37:16,010 --> 00:37:19,010
After I told you that there were no more promises left between us,

364
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:20,960
after returning the ring to you...

365
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:22,960
♫   I want to hold you,   ♫

366
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:24,920
All of that was to tell you  
 ♫    the one whose brilliance   ♫

367
00:37:24,920 --> 00:37:27,380
♫   chills my heart   ♫

368
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,820
that I would soon keep all of my promises to return.

369
00:37:28,820 --> 00:37:32,530
♫   I'm afraid you might fly away   ♫

370
00:37:32,530 --> 00:37:35,620
♫   when the wind blows   ♫

371
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,320
  You said that if we make a promise,  
  ♫   Because your smile and tears   ♫

372
00:37:38,320 --> 00:37:40,550
  there has to be a token. 

373
00:37:40,550 --> 00:37:44,180
♫   fill my heart,   ♫

374
00:37:44,180 --> 00:37:46,610
  Now, there are no more promises left between us, 

375
00:37:46,610 --> 00:37:49,290
♫   I will always love only you   ♫

376
00:37:49,290 --> 00:37:51,980
  For I will soon keep the 

377
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:56,280
♫   The feeling, which I tightly hold,   ♫

378
00:37:56,280 --> 00:37:57,800
  promise of returning. 

379
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:04,060
♫   can't be hidden   ♫

380
00:38:04,060 --> 00:38:06,020
I've come back safely like this. 
 ♫   We can't turn back   ♫

381
00:38:06,020 --> 00:38:07,220
♫   because you are here   ♫

382
00:38:07,220 --> 00:38:09,230
Can't you praise me for being courageous?

383
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:16,660
♫    Saying I love you without the words,   ♫

384
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:19,540
Now, you've kept all of your promises.

385
00:38:19,540 --> 00:38:25,330
So, please do not come anymore. 
 ♫   I can't let you leave my embrace   ♫

386
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:32,530
♫   I want to hold you,   ♫

387
00:38:32,530 --> 00:38:36,530
♫   the one whose brilliance chills my heart   ♫

388
00:38:36,530 --> 00:38:40,330
♫   I'm afraid you might fly away   ♫

389
00:38:40,330 --> 00:38:44,140
♫   when the wind blows   ♫

390
00:38:44,140 --> 00:38:48,270
♫   Because your smile and tears   ♫

Chae Gyeong.

394
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:02,470
♫   This love which cannot be   ♫

395
00:39:02,470 --> 00:39:04,950
Sin Chae Gyeong. 
 ♫   hurts so much,   ♫

396
00:39:04,950 --> 00:39:09,530
♫   it's unbearable   ♫

397
00:39:09,600 --> 00:39:14,900
♫   I'll bury you  in my heart  ♫

♫   Though I call your name again and again, can you not hear anymore?   ♫

00:39:40,140 --> 00:39:43,030

 ♫ a distant faint memory   ♫

405
00:39:43,030 --> 00:39:48,260
  So, please do not come anymore. 

406
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:51,890
♫   I want to remember you forever   ♫

407
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:54,050
  Young Lady! 

408
00:39:56,850 --> 00:39:58,860
Is it His Highness the Grand Prince?

409
00:40:03,710 --> 00:40:05,590
Your Majesty.

410
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:10,190
Were you waiting for Yeok?

411
00:40:11,650 --> 00:40:15,510
No, I was not.

412
00:40:22,220 --> 00:40:24,400
Are you allowed to come outside like this?

413
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:29,300
Yes, the physician allowed me to walk in moderation.

414
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,690
I am indebted to you, Your Majesty.

415
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:42,100
If it were not for you, I would already be dead.

416
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:50,900
Debt? Haven't you also saved my life before?

417
00:40:50,940 --> 00:40:53,990
How is that really saving you?

418
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:57,150
I'm sorry.

419
00:40:57,150 --> 00:41:03,720
For not telling you in advance. I unintentionally deceived Your Majesty.

420
00:41:06,070 --> 00:41:12,930
Alright. Though I wish to say it's alright, to be honest, it saddened me very much.

421
00:41:12,930 --> 00:41:17,660
Perhaps you couldn't trust me?

422
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,270
It isn't so. Please don't misunderstand.

423
00:41:20,270 --> 00:41:26,120
It wasn't that. To see someone's life go awry on my account...

424
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,420
I did not want to see that again.

425
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:41,020
From now on, there will never be an occasion for me to deceive Your Majesty.

426
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:45,310
I'm sorry.

427
00:41:58,320 --> 00:42:02,080
Alright. You've promised me then.

428
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:04,410
Yes.

429
00:42:30,410 --> 00:42:37,150
 From now on, there will never be an occasion for me to deceive Your Majesty. 

430
00:43:05,510 --> 00:43:06,990
Take a drink from me.

431
00:43:06,990 --> 00:43:08,640
Hey.

432
00:43:12,010 --> 00:43:15,230
Here, money for your wine. Pretend we're well-acquainted.

433
00:43:15,230 --> 00:43:17,450
One who buys you wine is a friend.

434
00:43:19,690 --> 00:43:22,630
Aunt! We're out of wine here.

435
00:43:23,750 --> 00:43:26,470
I need to use the bathroom.

436
00:43:27,390 --> 00:43:29,220
Who's that?

437
00:44:00,150 --> 00:44:01,680
You're all gathered here.

438
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:03,980
Hyungnim.

439
00:44:09,660 --> 00:44:12,130
You're here, Your Highness the Grand Prince.

440
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:14,090
Deputy Commander.

441
00:44:16,090 --> 00:44:18,550
I'm imitating Your Highness.

442
00:44:18,550 --> 00:44:24,150
Since Your Highness appeared at the palace without a word, I came here without a word as well.

443
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,780
I don't suppose you came to rebuke me more. What brings you here?

444
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:33,750
As you have shown your identity to the world now,

445
00:44:33,750 --> 00:44:38,570
wouldn't you need a distinct person to lead the rebellion?

446
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:51,370
Are you proposing that you do that? To spearhead an army of snail brides?

447
00:44:51,370 --> 00:44:56,330
Even while Your Highness was diligently trying to achieve marriage with the daughter of the First Vice Premier,

448
00:44:56,330 --> 00:44:58,110
the Snail Brides and Royal Merchant Band

449
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:04,960
and all other aspects linked to the rebellion must continue to carry on without anything amiss.

450
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:15,260
 State Council; First Vice Premier, Sin Soo Geun 

451
00:45:15,260 --> 00:45:18,170
 Six Ministries  

452
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,990
Hmm.

453
00:45:19,990 --> 00:45:25,290
Quite impressive. I thought you were just trading bags of rice.

454
00:45:26,470 --> 00:45:29,730
I have a present for you too.

455
00:45:36,950 --> 00:45:40,430
We greet you, Your Highness the Grand Prince.

456
00:45:41,270 --> 00:45:45,440
These are people who have sworn to help you change this nation.

457
00:45:45,440 --> 00:45:49,320
Among them are people who've lost their families during the last Literati Purge.

458
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:54,010
And those who were rich but had their wealth confiscated under false crime, after falling prey to the lures of treacherous men.

459
00:45:54,010 --> 00:45:56,830
And Confucian scholars who are discontented by the current state of political affairs.

460
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:01,230
As well as warriors who aspire to make a better Joseon by contributing their strength.

461
00:46:01,230 --> 00:46:06,860
Please be a sage king admired by the heavens and the citizens.

462
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:12,940
Please take good care of me.

463
00:46:12,940 --> 00:46:17,760
I'm Grand Prince Jin Seong, Lee Yeok!

464
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:21,220
Please be our sage king.

465
00:46:35,830 --> 00:46:38,140
When Grand Prince Jin Seong was born,

466
00:46:38,140 --> 00:46:44,360
the Buddhist nun that foresaw him and our Chae Gyeong as a match made in heaven and prayed for their happiness,

467
00:46:44,360 --> 00:46:51,060
why did she suddenly tell us not to trust the late king and leave behind such a terrible prophesy?

468
00:46:51,060 --> 00:46:57,260
I believe something happened between the late king and the head nun back then.

469
00:46:58,020 --> 00:47:03,490
It makes me uneasy that the nun was attacked by assassins.

470
00:47:03,490 --> 00:47:10,280
By any chance, the late King was the one who killed the Buddhist nun?

471
00:47:10,280 --> 00:47:12,770
Although I can't be certain,

472
00:47:12,770 --> 00:47:20,610
when the Buddhist nun betrayed the late king and told us the news, we have to assume that something of the sort happened.

473
00:47:20,610 --> 00:47:27,540
It's just...exactly why did the late king want to kill the Buddhist nun

474
00:47:27,540 --> 00:47:32,340
and what does that have to do with our Chae Gyeong's fate?

475
00:47:32,340 --> 00:47:35,190
That's unknown.

476
00:47:35,190 --> 00:47:39,550
All we can do is be warned and be careful.

477
00:47:51,330 --> 00:47:55,410
  Are you telling me to believe this? 

478
00:47:55,410 --> 00:48:01,030
  Shortly after Grand Prince Jin Seong was born, the late King Seongjong asked to see you. 

479
00:48:01,030 --> 00:48:07,250
 In attendance was also the head nun of Myoja Temple who served as the king's nun. 

480
00:48:10,120 --> 00:48:14,480
  What about marrying the Grand Prince and your daughter? 

481
00:48:16,880 --> 00:48:22,670
  The two children were born to protect each other. 

482
00:48:24,850 --> 00:48:27,220
  It would be an honor, Your Majesty. 

483
00:48:27,220 --> 00:48:30,880
  In honor of our promise tonight, 

484
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:36,170
 I shall leave a tattoo as a talisman for Chae Gyeong for her safety and fortune.  

485
00:48:36,170 --> 00:48:37,870
  Alright. 

486
00:48:44,420 --> 00:48:48,590
  After tattooing that talisman, 

487
00:48:48,590 --> 00:48:54,090
 it was a marvel that you, who used to be ridden with ailment, went on to grow for many years, healthy and unscathed.  

488
00:48:54,930 --> 00:48:56,590
 - But one day,
- Nun! 

489
00:48:56,590 --> 00:48:59,890
 the head nun who appeared to have been attacked 

490
00:48:59,890 --> 00:49:02,790
 came to see me covered in blood.  

491
00:49:02,790 --> 00:49:05,990
  Do not trust the late king. 

492
00:49:05,990 --> 00:49:10,310
  If Chae Gyeong gets entangled with the royal family, 

493
00:49:10,310 --> 00:49:14,970
  it will spark a bloodbath in the royal council 

494
00:49:17,610 --> 00:49:19,490
  and the royal family. 

495
00:49:19,490 --> 00:49:23,010
 Chae Gyeong will bring upon the royal family... 

496
00:49:23,010 --> 00:49:24,930
  Then, 

497
00:49:26,290 --> 00:49:30,730
  all of the misfortunes that came upon His Highness the Grand Prince... 

498
00:49:31,980 --> 00:49:34,680
  are because of this prophesy? 

499
00:49:36,690 --> 00:49:38,620
  It's because of me? 

500
00:49:38,620 --> 00:49:41,110
  We're not saying it's your fault. 

501
00:49:41,110 --> 00:49:49,630
  We're just telling you that if you can avoid a fate you should not counter, you should avoid it. 

502
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:11,280
 Sacred (神) Tree (樹) 

503
00:50:16,030 --> 00:50:19,550
This isn't a talisman, it's a curse.

504
00:50:37,920 --> 00:50:40,500
Chae Gyeong! Chae Gyeong!

505
00:50:58,950 --> 00:51:01,800
Where are you going?

506
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,970
I'm going to win your heart.

507
00:51:10,970 --> 00:51:12,870
I have no heart to give.

508
00:51:12,870 --> 00:51:14,840
I do.

509
00:51:28,690 --> 00:51:30,570
Sit here.

510
00:51:34,520 --> 00:51:36,240
Sit.

511
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:58,310
Until now, all of the bad things I've done to you, the lies I've told you,

512
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:00,590
and the things I need to apologize for...

513
00:52:00,590 --> 00:52:06,250
I've written a list of all the things I need to explain to you.

514
00:52:06,250 --> 00:52:09,760
I have nothing to ask nor am I curious about anything.

515
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:12,790
First, at that tavern—

516
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:15,070
Forget it.

517
00:52:15,070 --> 00:52:18,230
Then at the grave—

518
00:52:18,230 --> 00:52:20,710
Forget that too.

519
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:25,940
Then...

520
00:52:30,960 --> 00:52:33,950
you're curious as to how I survived, aren't you?

521
00:52:40,380 --> 00:52:46,380
While on my way to exile, I was ambushed by assassins and rolled down the dark mountainside.

522
00:52:46,380 --> 00:52:51,360
At that time, I was discovered by royal merchants who were on their way back from a long journey.

523
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,710
That royal merchant band is the actual owner of this pawn shop, and my partner.

524
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:04,220
People like us buy information and sell that information to the royal merchants.

525
00:53:04,220 --> 00:53:06,920
Then, the merchants will use that information

526
00:53:06,920 --> 00:53:10,840
to make deals and do business with the nobles.

527
00:53:10,840 --> 00:53:13,950
So, that's why you exchanged rice for information?

528
00:53:13,950 --> 00:53:17,200
Yes. Are you curious now?

529
00:53:17,200 --> 00:53:18,740
No.

530
00:53:21,950 --> 00:53:28,290
Let's see. Our pawn shop's record logs are detailed enough to...

531
00:53:28,290 --> 00:53:30,240
You were also mentioned somewhere in here.

532
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:31,910
Pardon?

533
00:53:32,890 --> 00:53:36,850
Sin Chae Gyeong. Birth name: Sin Chae Gyeong.

534
00:53:36,850 --> 00:53:38,870
Give it to me! I have to see it with my own eyes!

535
00:53:38,870 --> 00:53:41,180
I can't give it to you. Of course I won't!

536
00:53:41,180 --> 00:53:43,710
Give it to me!

537
00:53:43,710 --> 00:53:46,540
The First Vice Premier's daughter, Sin Chae Gyeong, is so ugly

538
00:53:46,540 --> 00:53:50,470
that despite reaching the ripe age for marriage, she is unable to marry.

539
00:53:50,470 --> 00:53:53,630
Ugly? Who wrote that nonsense?! Give that to me!

540
00:53:53,630 --> 00:53:58,780
Whenever Grand Prince Jin Seong's death anniversary rolls around, she drinks loads of alcohol and becomes dead drunk.

541
00:53:58,780 --> 00:54:00,220
Give it to me!

542
00:54:00,220 --> 00:54:03,560
Whenever she sees anyone who resembles Grand Prince Jin Seong, she asks, "Are you a ghost?" and—

543
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:06,070
Your Highness!

544
00:54:06,070 --> 00:54:08,040
Wow,

545
00:54:08,040 --> 00:54:11,110
you missed me this much.

546
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:12,810
Who missed you?

547
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:18,890
Now, you're not curious about anything? Are you telling me to believe that right now?

548
00:54:19,820 --> 00:54:22,350
I'm not curious about anything so just give me that.

549
00:54:22,350 --> 00:54:27,730
♫   I will shine in the sky every night   ♫

550
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:31,340
Here. 
  ♫    Yearning and yearning   ♫

551
00:54:31,340 --> 00:54:32,610
♫  If you can't forget  ♫

552
00:54:32,610 --> 00:54:37,740
♫   When the moonlight shines,   ♫

553
00:54:37,740 --> 00:54:40,430
♫   remember me   ♫

554
00:54:42,800 --> 00:54:45,860
If you look down on me because I'm a woman—

555
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:20,060
I've become curious about one thing.

556
00:55:21,810 --> 00:55:27,850
Back then, were you seriously injured?

557
00:55:34,550 --> 00:55:36,740
By any chance,

558
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:43,500
are you in pain now?

559
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,650
I'm all healed.

560
00:55:53,810 --> 00:55:58,680
May I see it?

561
00:56:29,630 --> 00:56:31,610
What are you doing?

562
00:56:33,560 --> 00:56:35,810
I'll just close my eyes

563
00:56:37,100 --> 00:56:39,910
and touch to see

564
00:56:41,210 --> 00:56:43,490
whether it healed properly,

565
00:56:44,070 --> 00:56:47,070
whether you're really not in pain anymore.

566
00:57:30,340 --> 00:57:33,270
I can feel it here.

567
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,820
Your scar...

568
00:57:37,460 --> 00:57:40,930
♫   You approached silently   ♫

569
00:57:40,930 --> 00:57:42,840
Here too...

570
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:48,180
♫   You smiled at me while offering your hand   ♫

571
00:57:48,180 --> 00:57:52,100
Does it not hurt?

572
00:57:52,100 --> 00:57:58,290
♫   The time we spent together   ♫

573
00:57:58,290 --> 00:58:06,140
I'm fine. 
 ♫   is going far away like a dream   ♫

574
00:58:06,140 --> 00:58:09,540
♫   I can't stand the longing now   ♫

575
00:58:09,540 --> 00:58:13,030
♫   which is growing so   ♫

576
00:58:13,030 --> 00:58:19,050
♫   Why didn't I know loving would be like this?   ♫

577
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:23,940
How did the precious and fair young master 
 ♫   I can't do anything else but leave   ♫

578
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:27,620
become like this? 
 ♫   even though I don't want to go   ♫

579
00:58:27,620 --> 00:58:30,710
♫   I know now that   ♫

580
00:58:30,710 --> 00:58:33,480
Are you teasing me on how 
 ♫   I can't live without you   ♫

581
00:58:33,480 --> 00:58:35,870
ugly I've grown?

582
00:58:35,870 --> 00:58:41,070
Ugly? You've grown up to be proud, 
 ♫   Don't go far away   ♫

583
00:58:41,070 --> 00:58:44,030
valiant, and strong. 
 ♫   so I can see you again   ♫

584
00:58:44,030 --> 00:58:50,440
♫   I love you once again   ♫

585
00:58:50,440 --> 00:58:54,920
Thank you. 
 ♫   I will be able to see you again one day   ♫

586
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:57,600
For returning alive, 
 ♫   Even if I can't see you again   ♫

587
00:58:57,600 --> 00:59:02,970
thank you, Your Highness. 
 ♫   after I turn away like this,   ♫

588
00:59:02,970 --> 00:59:10,560
♫   I will love you once again   ♫

589
00:59:10,560 --> 00:59:19,820
♫   Forever and ever, us   ♫

590
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:28,090
Grand Prince Jin Seong continues to evade our tail and keeps disappearing.

591
00:59:28,090 --> 00:59:31,700
As it is said, if you know your enemy and yourself, you will win all your battles.

592
00:59:31,700 --> 00:59:35,620
If you know nothing about where Grand Prince Jin Seong is and what he is doing,

593
00:59:35,620 --> 00:59:38,310
how will you prepare for war?

594
00:59:38,940 --> 00:59:44,400
Still, there's no reason we have to use Chae Gyeong.

595
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:49,100
Yes, there is: love.

596
00:59:51,390 --> 00:59:56,530
Although you can fool everyone else in the world, it's difficult to fool your lover's eyes,

597
00:59:56,530 --> 01:00:01,450
and it's difficult to deny your lover's heart.

598
01:00:01,450 --> 01:00:05,910
Therefore, there is no one better suited for the role.

599
01:00:07,770 --> 01:00:11,620
Then all the more reason we cannot use her! All the more we cannot

600
01:00:11,620 --> 01:00:15,210
use Chae Gyeong as Yeok's spy.

601
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:19,330
Love? Those two?

602
01:00:20,820 --> 01:00:24,660
It's simply pity and guilt.

603
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,220
It hasn't even been that long since they've met as adults.

604
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:30,930
How many times have they met for them to love each other?

605
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:34,710
If that is the definition of love, then Chae Gyeong is capable of loving

606
01:00:34,710 --> 01:00:38,540
everything and anything that exists in this world!

607
01:00:41,130 --> 01:00:45,940
Among those things, Grand Prince Jin Seong must be special.

608
01:00:52,670 --> 01:00:55,790
At the pawnshop earlier,

609
01:00:55,790 --> 01:01:00,790
you clearly said "we" and "our pawn shop".

610
01:01:01,450 --> 01:01:06,140
Aside from you, are there many more members?

611
01:01:06,140 --> 01:01:09,650
I think I met two people last time.

612
01:01:09,650 --> 01:01:16,720
One of them had a long face and another had a round face.

613
01:01:18,060 --> 01:01:23,290
Young Master Jo, Young Master Baek. All are my buddies.

614
01:01:24,530 --> 01:01:28,020
And there is one more person.

615
01:01:29,920 --> 01:01:36,800


616
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:39,840
Seo No.

617
01:01:40,440 --> 01:01:43,710
Seo No...Seo No?!

618
01:01:43,710 --> 01:01:44,930
My friend, Seo No?!

619
01:01:44,930 --> 01:01:49,160
Why is Seo No your friend? He's my friend— no, he's our friend.

620
01:01:49,160 --> 01:01:51,960
How are you with Seo No?

621
01:01:51,960 --> 01:01:56,480
As soon as I recovered my health, he was the first one I went to find.

622
01:01:57,110 --> 01:02:00,800
Earlier, you should have called him too. It would have been nice for all of us to have met.

623
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:04,810
Tell Seo No to come to my house tomorrow to exchange greetings.

624
01:02:06,440 --> 01:02:08,260
Did you hear what I just said?

625
01:02:08,870 --> 01:02:11,180
Between Seo No and me,

626
01:02:11,180 --> 01:02:13,490
who did you miss more?

627
01:02:14,170 --> 01:02:16,370
Of course that's—

628
01:02:17,290 --> 01:02:18,390
Seo No.

629
01:02:18,390 --> 01:02:19,530
You're lying.

630
01:02:19,530 --> 01:02:24,410
I'm being serious. Right now, I miss Seo No more because

631
01:02:24,410 --> 01:02:27,110
I'm staring at your face so much that I'm sick and tired of it.

632
01:02:27,110 --> 01:02:30,480
Did anyone ask about now? I asked about the past!

633
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:35,900
Now is more important and the future is even more important.

634
01:02:35,900 --> 01:02:41,250
So, you should also stare at my face as much as you can

635
01:02:41,250 --> 01:02:44,530
because we won't be able to meet again.

636
01:02:44,530 --> 01:02:46,790
What are you talking about right now?

637
01:02:49,190 --> 01:02:52,910
I came out to meet you with the intent of today being our last.

638
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,380
Let's stop seeing each other.

639
01:03:04,230 --> 01:03:05,880
I don't want to!

640
01:03:10,330 --> 01:03:13,360
  Why would time be important? 

641
01:03:13,990 --> 01:03:18,680
  One fleeting glance, one gust of wind that carries their breaths, 

642
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,570
  even at the tips of their fingertips that meet, 

643
01:03:21,570 --> 01:03:25,640
  love soon develops. 

644
01:03:27,290 --> 01:03:34,100
♫   I want to hold you, the one whose brilliance chills my heart   ♫
