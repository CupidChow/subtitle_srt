00:00:42,250 --> 00:00:44,550
Episode 13

2
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:46,170
King, Lee Yoong

3
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:51,350
First Vice Premier: Sin Soo Geun, Important

4
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,810
Young Lady, these Snail Brides pulled off another incident.

5
00:01:14,810 --> 00:01:17,650
I thought they were only giving rice to starving people,
[Ryu Ja Gwang following orders...]

6
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:21,910
but they also caught corrupted officials.

7
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:25,250
This is what the king should carry out.

8
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,780
No way.

9
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,510
Sin Soo Geun, with marriage we could bring him to our side.

10
00:01:42,610 --> 00:01:45,610
Sin Soo Geun, with marriage we could bring him to our side.

11
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:50,850
The moment Yeok has a will of his own, it is a traitorous mind

12
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:56,080
and everything he does contributes to treason.

13
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:58,260
No way.

14
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:00,430
Grand Prince.

15
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:24,300
What is this? Why is it like this?

16
00:02:31,010 --> 00:02:34,140
Try to see if anything is missing or if someone entered here.

17
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:44,140
- What's going on?
- The lock on the door was broken and the door to the secret room was left open too.

18
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:08,830
What?

19
00:03:08,830 --> 00:03:10,440
It's nothing.

20
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:15,110
- Who's there?
- What is it?

21
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,800
Catch him!

22
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:41,590
Sin Soo Geun, with marriage we could bring him to our side.

23
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,470
Your Majesty, you already knew about everything

24
00:05:04,470 --> 00:05:07,660
and asked me to become a spy?

25
00:05:08,490 --> 00:05:10,420
Why?

26
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:14,150
Do you really want me to kill the Grand Prince with my own hands?

27
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:18,240
Is that why you had me marry him?

28
00:05:33,340 --> 00:05:35,280
What kind of a punk...

29
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:38,540
Yeok.

30
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:49,030
I think it was a petty thief.

31
00:05:49,030 --> 00:05:54,090
If it were the Chief Secretary's people, the Royal Forces would be here already. But nothing happened.

32
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,650
Please handle it well so there won't be any consequences.

33
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:02,990
Why is he so pale? It's as if he's seen a ghost.

34
00:06:02,990 --> 00:06:08,380
Seo No's father turned out that way and the secret room was exposed. How can he be alright?

35
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:13,610
That's true. Look at us. Even a petty thief broke in.

36
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:17,640
I will go to the Queen Dowager.

37
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,500
Seo No.

38
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:25,950
Why are you so surprised? We have to work. Customers will be here soon.

39
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,710
Still, you should take the day off...

40
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:32,520
I am going to move my father's grave next to grandmother's grave located in Dongjukjeon village.

41
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:37,010
In order to do so, we need to drive away the current king.

42
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,140
There is no time to rest.

43
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:04,100
Oh my! Oh my! You scared me.

44
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:09,110
Where is Chae Gyeong?

45
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:12,170
Weren't you two together?

46
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:16,600
If not, where did she go?

47
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:30,170
Your Majesty, please deliberate on this matter.

48
00:07:33,580 --> 00:07:37,390
Your Majesty, please deliberate on this matter.

49
00:07:37,390 --> 00:07:41,230
I have been unfairly treated, Your Majesty.

50
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,690
After reading the Snail Bride's bulletin,

51
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,850
you pushed for Ryu Ja Gwang's impeachment. Still, it's unfair?

52
00:07:51,850 --> 00:07:54,660
That is so.

53
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:58,290
You should show your loyalty to me through work,

54
00:07:58,290 --> 00:08:03,080
yet you dared to write an anonymous petition criticizing me. And this is unfair treatment?

55
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:08,710
It's for you, the royal family, and for this country of Joseon,

56
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,770
I had no choice—

57
00:08:17,950 --> 00:08:20,960
You show absolutely no sign of remorse.

58
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,040
Do you think you're being unfairly treated as well?

59
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:30,850
N-n-no. Your Majesty.

60
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:34,730
That's good. Then, pay for your crimes.

61
00:09:08,210 --> 00:09:10,120
Remove their bodies.

62
00:09:32,190 --> 00:09:35,180
After discovering the betrayal of my loved one,

63
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:43,170
finally, I face the real world that was unknown to me before.

64
00:09:50,510 --> 00:09:53,670
The king whom I supported for a long time

65
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:58,780
had become a ruler who reigns with tyranny.

66
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:03,420
I

67
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:08,090
was a very foolish and dim-witted girl.

68
00:10:11,750 --> 00:10:13,700
Chae Gyeong.

69
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:27,450
Chae Gyeong!

70
00:10:33,050 --> 00:10:38,330
Chae Gyeong broke into the locked pawn shop?

71
00:10:38,330 --> 00:10:42,930
Yes. She hit the pawn shop door lock several times with a blunt object.

72
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:50,350
It finally has begun. Suspicion, a crack in their relationship, and monitoring.

73
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:54,490
Chae Gyeong will soon be here to give her report.

74
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,730
I will catch the evidence and make a move then.

75
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,830
So until then, watch over the pawn shop more thoroughly.

76
00:11:00,830 --> 00:11:02,700
Yes.

77
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:09,430
The late king's secret order is engraved on a woman's body.

78
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,020
That scribe really had this with him?

79
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:37,270
Yes, while preparing for his funeral, I went through Seo No's father's belongings, just in case.

80
00:11:37,270 --> 00:11:42,280
Seo No's father had this sewn into his clothes. I found it.

81
00:11:43,020 --> 00:11:45,170
A woman's body.

82
00:11:46,050 --> 00:11:50,020
The secret order is inscribed on a woman's body as a tattoo.

83
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,180
I will have the late king's palace maids and concubines checked.

84
00:11:56,600 --> 00:12:00,920
For someone to have her body inscribed with the secret will ordering abdication of the throne to Yeok,

85
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:03,340
she must be someone who can help him.

86
00:12:03,340 --> 00:12:05,840
It won't be the late king's concubine.

87
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,130
Every single one of them wants her son to become the king.

88
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:12,740
Why would they help Grand Prince Jin Seong to the throne?

89
00:12:15,980 --> 00:12:21,080
Tattooed onto a woman's body.

90
00:12:27,340 --> 00:12:31,970
The Queen Dowager is talking about the woman of the secret order.

91
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:35,930
Did they find out the identity of that woman?

92
00:12:35,930 --> 00:12:38,310
Not yet.

93
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:45,450
If we find the woman of the secret order, what will you do next?

94
00:12:45,450 --> 00:12:49,150
As soon as the Queen Dowager makes her move,

95
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,400
we will have to step forward first.

96
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:55,560
Whoever that woman may be, she won't be favorable to us.

97
00:12:55,560 --> 00:13:00,280
Favorable or not, why does it matter?

98
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:05,080
We just need to see that wench's body.

99
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,120
That tattoo inscribed on her body.

100
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:11,130
If my men kill her and bring her to me,

101
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:14,350
you could

102
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,470
look over her body.

103
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:20,940
Yes. I will do that.

104
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:35,710
Give it to me. I will do it.

105
00:13:35,710 --> 00:13:38,570
You must feed this to her.

106
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:57,890
♫ You approached silently ♫

107
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:05,410
♫ You smiled at me while offering your hand ♫

108
00:14:05,410 --> 00:14:08,090
No matter how much I think about it,

109
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:13,590
I can't watch you die again.

110
00:14:13,590 --> 00:14:19,810
♫ Is going far away like a dream ♫

111
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,040
♫ I can't stand the longing now which is growing so ♫

112
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:27,550
How can I let you die by my own hands?

113
00:14:27,550 --> 00:14:32,850
♫ Why didn't I know loving would be that? ♫

114
00:14:32,870 --> 00:14:36,870
Before your traitorous mind is discovered by anyone,

115
00:14:36,870 --> 00:14:42,220
I will change your mind.

116
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:49,780
♫ I know now that I can't live without you ♫

117
00:14:49,780 --> 00:14:52,320
I was being selfish.

118
00:14:53,320 --> 00:14:56,560
Even though I knew it would hurt you like this,

119
00:14:57,490 --> 00:15:00,650
I desired you.

120
00:15:00,650 --> 00:15:03,940
♫ I love you once again ♫

121
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:08,090
♫ The promise that we shared  ♫

122
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:14,910
♫ Became words we could no longer keep  ♫

123
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:24,950
♫ We know. Our destiny is inevitable ♫

124
00:15:25,030 --> 00:15:30,140
As soon as you find out, come to Biseoseong library in the palace.

125
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:36,740
♫ Even if we are far apart, it's alright if we are under the same sky ♫

126
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:44,480
♫ I will be able to see you again someday ♫

127
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:51,340
♫ Even if I can't see you again if I turn away  ♫

128
00:15:51,340 --> 00:15:58,680
♫ I will love you once again. You ♫

129
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:08,850
♫ Forever and ever us. ♫

130
00:16:08,850 --> 00:16:12,360
I will cancel the exile of Vice Minister of Defense, Ryu Ja Gwang,

131
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:16,170
and promote him to Minister of Defense.

132
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:19,020
- Your Majesty.
- Please deliberate on this matter.

133
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:23,450
You are not punishing the criminal but promoting him to a higher position?

134
00:16:23,450 --> 00:16:27,410
Your Majesty, the people know about this matter already.

135
00:16:27,410 --> 00:16:29,850
However if you cover up his crimes like this—

136
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:33,680
Naturally, they will come to believe that the contents of the bulletin are false

137
00:16:33,680 --> 00:16:37,290
and my decision is the truth.

138
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:39,610
As long as the people believe me more than

139
00:16:39,610 --> 00:16:45,830
the Snail Brides or whatever ratty people.

140
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,920
If someone believes the words of the Snail Brides and criticizes my decision,

141
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:56,250
that is challenging the superiors and treason. Don't you agree?

142
00:17:03,520 --> 00:17:05,410
Deputy Commander.

143
00:17:06,090 --> 00:17:07,490
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:12,280
It seems like you have many grievances against me.

145
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:14,590
That is not true, Your Majesty.

146
00:17:14,590 --> 00:17:16,820
That is not true?

147
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:23,340
But what can I do? I have many grievances against you.

148
00:17:23,340 --> 00:17:28,420
When you should be checking the coming and going of the Capital Defense during their night duty,

149
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:32,480
you were leisurely enjoying your time in the alleyway pawn shop.

150
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:36,220
- I guess you don't want to work?
- I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty. I meant—

151
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,120
I am ordering that the Capital Defense Deputy Commander Park Won Jong be put on probation.

152
00:17:40,120 --> 00:17:43,970
You don't have to attend the court sessions for a month.

153
00:17:43,970 --> 00:17:45,090
Your Majesty.

154
00:17:45,090 --> 00:17:48,080
If I see your face in the palace,

155
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,790
I will take it as disobeying the royal command

156
00:17:51,790 --> 00:17:54,700
and punish you with the crime of challenging your superior.

157
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:58,390
I will uphold your order.

158
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:15,120
Oh, what nice weather.

159
00:18:24,950 --> 00:18:28,990
Look at those annoying people. They are still monitoring us. They should just leave.

160
00:18:32,280 --> 00:18:35,140
Welcome. Long time no see.

161
00:18:35,140 --> 00:18:37,920
- Do you really give rice?
- Of course.

162
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:41,290
The officials who submitted the Defense Minister's impeachment petitions had their heads cut off.

163
00:18:41,290 --> 00:18:44,420
They died for writing an impeachment petition?

164
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:47,730
My uncle was suddenly ordered to be on probation too.

165
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:52,880
Lord Ryu Ja Gwang was reinstated, even promoted.

166
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:56,430
The king has finally gone crazy. That's like burying his head in the sand.

167
00:18:56,430 --> 00:19:02,060
He must have felt that not the King, but the Grand Prince was running politics behind the scenes.

168
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:05,760
If he will be like this about everything, bulletins will be useless.

169
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:09,500
Now people won't even try to read the bulletin unless they are very brave.

170
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:14,560
Still, we can't stop what we were doing.

171
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:19,230
We cannot stay put worrying about the unpredictable king's next step,

172
00:19:19,230 --> 00:19:21,940
when there are so many corrupt officials everywhere in Joseon.

173
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:26,450
We have to eliminate them as soon as possible for Joseon to run properly.

174
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:29,580
By the way, where is the Grand Prince?

175
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:33,230
His wife is sick so he's with her.

176
00:19:33,230 --> 00:19:39,060
If something arises, I am supposed to hide the bamboo scroll under the terrace stone of the men's quarters.

177
00:20:57,960 --> 00:21:01,220
Please become the king as soon as possible.

178
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:03,300
Once you're the king,

179
00:21:04,030 --> 00:21:07,230
you can protect the remaining people.

180
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,800
Lady of the House, you're here.

181
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:13,370
My lady, are you recovered?

182
00:22:17,810 --> 00:22:20,280
They are all spies.

183
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:24,960
Miss! Are you finally feeling better?

184
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:28,310
I've been aching for a few days and it's time I should get up.

185
00:22:28,310 --> 00:22:30,890
That was fast!

186
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:34,860
The Grand Prince toiled quite a bit to lower your fever.

187
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:37,920
I thought he might collapse from fatigue at that rate.

188
00:22:37,920 --> 00:22:41,640
Regrettably he's just fine.

189
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:46,210
I laugh thanks to you.

190
00:22:46,210 --> 00:22:48,400
As long as you laughed, it'll do.

191
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:51,650
Oh, speak of the devil.

192
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:58,310
Why are you out here?

193
00:22:58,310 --> 00:23:00,910
You can't be well yet.

194
00:23:07,580 --> 00:23:10,890
Greetings to the Grand Prince and the Lady of the House.

195
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:15,790
I can't let them catch on no matter what.

196
00:23:15,790 --> 00:23:20,260
I heard you toiled a lot due to me these past few days.

197
00:23:20,260 --> 00:23:22,930
Well... toil...

198
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,210
Let's go on in first.

199
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,470
What?

200
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:41,680
This place is full of palace staff.

201
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:44,440
We can't trust anyone besides my nanny.

202
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,860
So?

203
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:48,740
We don't know how they will report to the superiors

204
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:51,910
or whether they'll make up matters that never happened,

205
00:23:51,910 --> 00:23:53,820
so I'm just taking precautions.

206
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,510
That's very unlike you.

207
00:23:58,170 --> 00:24:01,150
That doesn't suit you, Chae Gyeong.

208
00:24:01,150 --> 00:24:06,090
If it's something you believe in, you do not cower.

209
00:24:06,090 --> 00:24:08,970
You always behave according to what you see

210
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,040
and according to what exists. That's your charm.

211
00:24:13,040 --> 00:24:14,870
Me?

212
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,490
I can no longer do that.

213
00:24:28,170 --> 00:24:30,960
I am married now.

214
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,580
If I just carry on so innocently,

215
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:36,960
how will I protect my family?

216
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,120
Hence...

217
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:44,010
are you saying you will protect me?

218
00:24:44,010 --> 00:24:49,850
When I made my marriage promise, I already committed my mind to it.

219
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,370
Grand Prince, no, dear husband,

220
00:24:56,680 --> 00:25:01,390
you will also safeguard me and us.

221
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:24,980
Your fever is gone.

222
00:25:34,220 --> 00:25:36,400
We want to be alone.

223
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,560
Leave.

224
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:41,090
- Grand Prince.
- Go sleep in the Row Corridor (servants row).

225
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:46,020
Today we will have sleep in the same room.

226
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,680
S-s-same room?

227
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,750
At once!

228
00:25:56,830 --> 00:25:57,580
You startled me.

229
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,470
You got caught red-handed. What is that?

230
00:26:00,470 --> 00:26:02,010
Give it.

231
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:04,640
Wait till I catch you.

232
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:08,070
Hey.

233
00:26:08,070 --> 00:26:10,680
You!

234
00:26:10,680 --> 00:26:13,100
Think about it.

235
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:15,010
A newlywed couple.

236
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:17,970
Is there something more ridiculous

237
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,950
than using separate rooms?

238
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:23,070
Isn't it a common occurrence in the palace?

239
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:26,020
But the issue is this isn't the palace.

240
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:30,450
We are just ordinary people.

241
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:34,130
Even if our eyes just meet, we smile.

242
00:26:34,130 --> 00:26:36,080
And we sleep under one blanket.

243
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,990
Then we dread having to come out from that blanket.

244
00:26:39,990 --> 00:26:47,270
Well, anyhow, isn't that what a newlywed couple means?

245
00:26:47,270 --> 00:26:50,670
The newlywed couple as I know it,

246
00:26:50,670 --> 00:26:56,050
is when the wife awakes in the morning, the husband fetches washing water.

247
00:26:56,050 --> 00:27:00,610
When she's tired and her shoulders are stiff, he massages them for her.

248
00:27:00,610 --> 00:27:04,290
When they go to the market together, he carries the heavy load for her.

249
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:10,350
Until she falls asleep, he will hug her tight. That's what newlywed...

250
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:28,020
Until you fall asleep, I shall hug you tightly.

251
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:32,000
So stay here tonight.

252
00:27:56,340 --> 00:27:59,510
Your Majesty, it's already past the Hour of Rat (11pm - 1am).

253
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,800
Please go to your chamber.

254
00:28:05,830 --> 00:28:09,040
She's not coming today either.

255
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:42,150
How are the two of you together?

256
00:28:44,290 --> 00:28:48,860
Your subject was on the way to deliver appeals to Your Majesty.

257
00:28:48,860 --> 00:28:52,960
I ran into the Queen Dowager by chance and I was inquiring on her well-being.

258
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:55,450
And I was on the way to the Queen's Palace.

259
00:28:55,450 --> 00:29:00,110
But Your Majesty, have you been drinking until now?

260
00:29:00,110 --> 00:29:06,130
The two of you are a true family now.

261
00:29:06,130 --> 00:29:08,480
Chae Gyeong and Yeok are married.

262
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:12,320
Now the two of you are family too.

263
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,910
Your affection for your family

264
00:29:14,910 --> 00:29:18,840
is well-known to anyone in Joseon.

265
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:21,200
And Royal Mother's love for her son

266
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,240
doesn't need repeating.

267
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:26,140
Your Majesty.

268
00:29:28,350 --> 00:29:31,460
Did you know it already, Minister?

269
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:39,140
In the end will you stand by Grand Prince Jin Seong too?

270
00:29:39,140 --> 00:29:43,190
I ask, are you harboring a desire to rebel

271
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:46,340
to push me out?

272
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,810
Your Majesty.

273
00:29:47,810 --> 00:29:49,750
Your Majesty, what do you mean by a rebellious mind?

274
00:29:49,750 --> 00:29:56,120
If not, how could Chae Gyeong remain so quiet?

275
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:58,300
She said we were family.

276
00:29:58,300 --> 00:30:00,430
She didn't want my feelings hurt

277
00:30:00,430 --> 00:30:02,730
so she said she would share Yeok's punishment.

278
00:30:02,730 --> 00:30:06,790
But now that child

279
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:11,730
is blinded.

280
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,640
Your Majesty.

281
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:28,490
Are you alright?

282
00:30:28,490 --> 00:30:30,470
Queen.

283
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:40,950
Queen. Help me keep the First Vice Premier and Chae Gyeong.

284
00:30:41,000 --> 00:30:43,070
Your Majesty.

285
00:30:43,070 --> 00:30:46,450
You and the crown prince,

286
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,620
the First Vice Premier, and Chae Gyeong too.

287
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:51,640
You're all my family and my people.

288
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:54,830
You're all my people.

289
00:30:56,690 --> 00:31:03,500
Yes. We are all your people.

290
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:14,580
Let's go in.

291
00:31:32,110 --> 00:31:35,670
Now that the kids are married, you and I sit across like this,

292
00:31:35,670 --> 00:31:38,700
and we get to drink tea.

293
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:45,850
However, His Majesty's suspicions are growing deeper by the day and that is a worry.

294
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:51,480
Since ancient days, suspicion has been said to be one of the virtues of a monarch.

295
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:56,250
If the Grand Prince is faithful, this matter shall end at suspicion alone.

296
00:31:56,250 --> 00:32:02,160
You don't mean you are also suspicious of Grand Prince Jin Seong?

297
00:32:02,160 --> 00:32:03,800
His behavior in the past was...

298
00:32:03,800 --> 00:32:07,890
You cannot trust him, thus you are investigating him personally?

299
00:32:07,890 --> 00:32:10,280
It's not that.

300
00:32:12,200 --> 00:32:16,490
What am I investigating?

301
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:21,460
My recent investigation is only about the Snail Brides.

302
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:25,910
I wonder why you are taking heart on that matter?

303
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:31,530
Is what I am investigating linked to the Grand Prince Jin Seong in some way?

304
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,990
How should I know what you are investigating, First Vice Premier?

305
00:32:36,990 --> 00:32:39,780
I just spit out those words without a thought.

306
00:32:41,150 --> 00:32:46,220
I earnestly request it, Queen Dowager.

307
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:49,950
Please think only of their happiness as a parent.

308
00:32:49,950 --> 00:32:54,630
Are you saying that I'm making those two kids unhappy?

309
00:32:54,630 --> 00:32:58,110
Didn't you say so yourself?

310
00:32:58,110 --> 00:33:01,370
You said that Chae Gyeong and Grand Prince Jin Seong are destined to be together.

311
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:08,790
When I think back, I realize that even the late King tried to bring those two together.

312
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:14,320
So they were destined to be together a long time ago.

313
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:22,320
Destiny isn't something that needs assistance,

314
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:25,940
but it flows as if everything is predetermined — that's why it's called destiny.

315
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:33,360
What do you think of us just watching over them to make sure that they live well on their own?

316
00:33:46,370 --> 00:33:50,670
If he went as far as to inscribe the secret order to abdicate the throne to my Yeok,

317
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:53,580
it must be someone who can help him.

318
00:34:02,500 --> 00:34:06,280
Even the late King tried to bring those two together.

319
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:12,380
How in the world did I forget about that?

320
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:33,340
I will grant you one of your wishes if we meet again.

321
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:49,070
Listen, please call Eunuch Song over here.

322
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:51,460
Yes, Lady of the House.

323
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,110
You're here.

324
00:35:01,110 --> 00:35:05,120
The lady just went out.

325
00:35:05,120 --> 00:35:08,570
Went out? Where did she go in that condition?

326
00:35:08,570 --> 00:35:12,350
That's what I'm saying, for goodness sake.

327
00:35:12,350 --> 00:35:15,180
She said that she's going to the palace.

328
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,470
The palace?

329
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,160
Yes, she said that she was going to visit the King.

330
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:23,520
And Eunuch Song went with her as well.

331
00:35:25,350 --> 00:35:28,660
Brew this herbal tonic and give it to her later.

332
00:35:40,420 --> 00:35:43,140
I will report to the King.

333
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:16,850
Your Majesty, there's one more hour left until the council meeting.

334
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:26,730
Head Eunuch, I am not in the mood for hearing those old men nag.

335
00:36:26,730 --> 00:36:30,550
How about you taking my place?

336
00:36:30,550 --> 00:36:35,060
Why don't you experience stamping the imperial seal and even sitting on the throne?

337
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:38,520
Your Majesty! How could you say that?

338
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,970
That's utterly unreasonable.

339
00:36:39,970 --> 00:36:42,550
Your Majesty, Eunuch Song is here.

340
00:36:42,550 --> 00:36:46,370
It looks like Chae Gyeong is here.

341
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,200
Do you also think this is unfair?

342
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:05,430
N-n-no, Your Majesty.

343
00:37:05,430 --> 00:37:08,060
Then you should pay for your crimes.

344
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:17,460
Your Majesty, are you alright?

345
00:37:18,620 --> 00:37:20,700
You are here at last.

346
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:24,960
Were you waiting for me?

347
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:28,000
You should write a letter when you need me.

348
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:31,010
- Since when did you— ?
- Since when you ask?

349
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,780
Are you asking when I got here or...?

350
00:37:35,780 --> 00:37:38,880
are you asking how long I've been waiting for you?

351
00:37:42,300 --> 00:37:44,270
For a long time.

352
00:37:46,750 --> 00:37:49,040
It's been a long time.

353
00:37:51,420 --> 00:37:53,170
Your Majesty.

354
00:38:01,220 --> 00:38:06,280
You told me to find out about that pawn shop.

355
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:10,070
I did. Now, what did you see there?

356
00:38:10,070 --> 00:38:13,140
I didn't see anything.

357
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:16,530
Before I received the royal command,

358
00:38:16,530 --> 00:38:20,590
I realized that I completely forgot about the most important thing.

359
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:26,830
That there is something I need to ask you and hear the answer to.

360
00:38:27,890 --> 00:38:30,320
What do you want to know?

361
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:36,300
Since when did you start being suspicious of the Grand Prince?

362
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:40,970
Since he returned.

363
00:38:40,970 --> 00:38:42,400
How come?

364
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:48,100
It's because he probably came back for revenge and to take the throne.

365
00:38:48,910 --> 00:38:53,600
He believes that I was trying to kill him.

366
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:54,740
Your Highness the Grand Prince.

367
00:38:54,740 --> 00:38:57,200
Where is my brother?

368
00:38:57,910 --> 00:39:03,210
Did you really command the Grand Prince's death?

369
00:39:03,210 --> 00:39:07,470
I did. I was the one who killed him.

370
00:39:08,530 --> 00:39:12,660
Even if I didn't kill him with my own hands, every night

371
00:39:12,660 --> 00:39:15,820
I stabbed him in my dreams.

372
00:39:15,820 --> 00:39:23,130
I wanted someone to kill him in my place.

373
00:39:23,130 --> 00:39:27,970
But still you weren't the one who killed him.

374
00:39:27,970 --> 00:39:35,320
No. If I have the chance and the justification to do so, I would love to kill him with my own hands.

375
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:44,160
Even now, can't you work out all of the misunderstandings and make up as brothers?

376
00:39:45,450 --> 00:39:49,300
This may be the only chance to bring everything back to the way things were.

377
00:39:49,300 --> 00:39:53,840
If so, you'll be doing the same thing.

378
00:39:56,380 --> 00:40:00,510
If I resolve all of our misunderstandings and make up,

379
00:40:00,510 --> 00:40:06,070
then you will also forgive him and get along well with him again.

380
00:40:07,540 --> 00:40:09,350
Your Majesty.

381
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:16,500
Now you also have a line of suspicion as well.

382
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,940
And now a crack in your relationship has started.

383
00:40:20,860 --> 00:40:26,140
I really do not want to see you two happy again.

384
00:40:26,140 --> 00:40:27,860
Your Majesty, what are you...?

385
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,710
Don't you know?!

386
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:32,460
Now, rather than making up with Yeok,

387
00:40:32,460 --> 00:40:37,550
it has become more important for me to see you two hating, resenting each other and growing apart!

388
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,200
So that way,

389
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,620
So that way...

390
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:14,860
Your Majesty. You made a promise that you would grant one of my wishes.

391
00:41:14,860 --> 00:41:16,350
Do you remember?

392
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:19,820
If we meet again in the future, I will grant one of your wishes.

393
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,570
I was going to use it once before...

394
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:27,120
But you didn't let me for my own sake.

395
00:41:28,600 --> 00:41:33,230
This time it's only for me.

396
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,840
Your Highness the Grand Prince!

397
00:41:43,750 --> 00:41:51,290
Please give me the royal permission to leave town with the Grand Prince so we can be together.

398
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,910
Leave town?

399
00:41:54,910 --> 00:41:58,060
The Grand Prince of Joseon leaving the capital and living elsewhere

400
00:41:58,060 --> 00:42:01,000
is against the law of the country and I'm well aware of that.

401
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,440
So I beg of you.

402
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:08,210
We as a couple should go to a place that's as far away from the capital as possible.

403
00:42:08,210 --> 00:42:11,700
And once we get there, we will live ordinary lives.

404
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:19,270
Only this will take away your suspicions.

405
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:24,290
And I feel like this is the only way for all of us to be in peace.

406
00:42:25,580 --> 00:42:28,120
Did you work it all out with Yeok?

407
00:42:33,190 --> 00:42:35,130
Yes.

408
00:42:36,260 --> 00:42:40,140
So, that rascal is leaving the capital for the countryside? Not if I can help it!

409
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:44,070
A rascal who was busy looking for the secret order up until his wedding day?!

410
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:46,480
A secret order?

411
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,210
"When Grand Prince Jin Seong becomes an adult,

412
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:52,100
give him the royal throne."

413
00:42:52,100 --> 00:42:55,470
It's the secret order where my royal father's will is written on.

414
00:42:56,260 --> 00:43:01,500
Exactly where is that secret order?

415
00:43:04,890 --> 00:43:12,550
The late king inscribed it on a woman's body.

416
00:43:28,950 --> 00:43:31,540
Now it's your turn to answer.

417
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:36,020
What did you see at the pawn shop?

418
00:43:36,630 --> 00:43:39,450
Did you find evidence of Yeok's rebellion?

419
00:43:39,450 --> 00:43:44,130
I do not know what you mean.

420
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:49,430
If it's not that, then why did you come out from the pawn shop looking so dazed?

421
00:43:49,430 --> 00:43:54,700
Have you been monitoring me?

422
00:43:54,700 --> 00:43:56,860
Speak.

423
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,430
I will speak.

424
00:44:22,980 --> 00:44:25,410
You rascal!

425
00:44:39,590 --> 00:44:41,570
Don't come near.

426
00:44:41,570 --> 00:44:42,620
How dare you!

427
00:44:42,620 --> 00:44:45,120
She's my wife.

428
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:57,170
Both of you, please stop.

429
00:45:13,730 --> 00:45:19,530
♫  Suddenly the whole world is filled by you ♫

430
00:45:21,350 --> 00:45:24,450
From now on, don't come meet my brother alone.

431
00:45:25,100 --> 00:45:26,980
Isn't it dangerous?

432
00:45:26,980 --> 00:45:31,190
Aren't you the one who is more dangerous to me right now?

433
00:45:31,190 --> 00:45:33,370
♫  I couldn't bring myself to look at your eyes  ♫

434
00:45:33,370 --> 00:45:36,930
What if you keep going like this and fall?

435
00:45:36,930 --> 00:45:39,000
♫ What do I do now  ♫

436
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:42,540
I can just grab you tight.

437
00:45:42,540 --> 00:45:48,040
No matter what happens, don't let go of me and grab tight.

438
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:55,020
♫  I want to hold you, the one whose brilliance chills my heart  ♫

439
00:45:55,020 --> 00:46:02,900
♫  I'm afraid you might fly away when the wind blows  ♫

440
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:06,510
♫  Because your smile and tears fill my heart,  ♫

441
00:46:06,510 --> 00:46:07,820
Don't come near.

442
00:46:07,820 --> 00:46:08,700
How dare you!

443
00:46:08,700 --> 00:46:10,530
She's my wife!

444
00:46:12,990 --> 00:46:15,010
♫  I will always love only you  ♫

445
00:46:15,010 --> 00:46:17,190
Your Majesty.

446
00:46:17,190 --> 00:46:18,710
What is it?

447
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:22,170
I've summoned women at the Thousand Autumn Hall.

448
00:46:22,170 --> 00:46:24,980
Would you like to look through them personally?

449
00:46:24,980 --> 00:46:26,810
You see to it.

450
00:46:26,810 --> 00:46:28,060
Yes.

451
00:46:28,060 --> 00:46:30,670
No.

452
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:34,520
There's a girl I want to summon.

453
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:40,710
Yeok's girl that frequents the Queen Dowager's Palace.

454
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:43,910
Do you mean the Deputy Commander's niece?

455
00:46:43,910 --> 00:46:49,010
They are in-laws with my royal father so that girl

456
00:46:49,010 --> 00:46:52,300
is also one of the late king's women in a wide sense.

457
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:56,770
Yes. I will send a message for her to enter the palace.

458
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:02,500
Miss.

459
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:06,410
Oh my! What on earth! What happened?

460
00:47:06,410 --> 00:47:08,360
Oh my goodness!

461
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:10,390
What were you doing while at her side?

462
00:47:10,390 --> 00:47:12,750
Nanny.

463
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:16,570
I'm just upset. I'm sorry.

464
00:47:16,570 --> 00:47:20,110
Let's hurry on in.

465
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,760
Oh my word. What happened?

466
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:33,260
Oh this is upsetting me.

467
00:47:33,260 --> 00:47:37,100
To be sure. The new groom isn't doing what the new bride tells him to do.

468
00:47:37,100 --> 00:47:39,830
I just don't know what he's wandering around doing.

469
00:47:39,830 --> 00:47:43,000
I don't think I can die even if I wanted to.

470
00:47:43,700 --> 00:47:46,080
Now it's done.

471
00:47:47,750 --> 00:47:49,990
Rest up.

472
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:56,070
Where is that secret order?

473
00:48:56,070 --> 00:48:58,920
Sacred Tree

474
00:49:15,500 --> 00:49:19,000
Please really keep this a secret from my husband.

475
00:49:31,230 --> 00:49:34,080
I came by His Majesty's summons.

476
00:49:34,080 --> 00:49:39,320
Please announce me as Yoon, Deputy Commander Park's maternal niece.

477
00:49:39,320 --> 00:49:44,010
Your Majesty, Deputy Commander's maternal niece, Miss Yoon is here.

478
00:49:44,010 --> 00:49:46,270
Send her in.

479
00:49:51,670 --> 00:49:53,610
Come out.

480
00:50:13,020 --> 00:50:15,710
I greet Your Majesty.

481
00:50:22,630 --> 00:50:27,900
Do you know what happened today because of you?

482
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,800
Because of that rascal, Yeok, Chae Gyeong got hurt.

483
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:38,460
So you should pay the price for saving that rascal.

484
00:50:44,720 --> 00:50:48,260
Starting now, answer what I ask you.

485
00:50:48,260 --> 00:50:50,990
If you can't answer,

486
00:50:50,990 --> 00:50:56,500
the clothing you are wearing will be slashed away by this sword one by one.

487
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:02,680
When all your clothes are slashed away, then your flesh too. And after that?

488
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:05,110
Your life.

489
00:51:05,110 --> 00:51:06,850
Your Majesty.

490
00:51:06,850 --> 00:51:09,750
Who's the captain of Snail Brides?

491
00:51:11,650 --> 00:51:14,380
What do you mean Snail Brides?

492
00:51:23,020 --> 00:51:26,810
I asked who's the captain of the Snail Brides.

493
00:51:26,810 --> 00:51:29,230
Is it Grand Prince Jin Seong?

494
00:51:30,210 --> 00:51:32,160
I don't know.

495
00:51:36,170 --> 00:51:39,790
I had no care about the likes of your body.

496
00:51:39,790 --> 00:51:44,730
But if you continue to carry out like this, it can't be helped.

497
00:51:48,150 --> 00:51:52,300
Today you and I will become very close.

498
00:51:52,300 --> 00:51:54,540
Isn't that right?

499
00:52:01,590 --> 00:52:07,600
Do you know why I haven't killed Yeok yet?

500
00:52:11,490 --> 00:52:14,060
Because it's fun.

501
00:52:15,870 --> 00:52:18,870
Let him squirm in nervousness not knowing when he will die.

502
00:52:18,870 --> 00:52:21,230
Just to stay alive no matter what,

503
00:52:21,230 --> 00:52:24,890
he wears a mask and puts on an act in front of me.

504
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:26,850
He looks so funny to me.

505
00:52:26,850 --> 00:52:30,210
When else could I get another funny spectacle like this?

506
00:52:31,310 --> 00:52:38,050
He gave me a fun time, so when he dies, I will give him a prognosis equal to that.

507
00:52:38,050 --> 00:52:41,940
I will torture him. Then I will brand him with hot-iron.

508
00:52:41,940 --> 00:52:45,210
Then I will rip his limbs to shreds.

509
00:52:45,210 --> 00:52:50,490
I will put him outside the city gate like some food for beasts.

510
00:53:14,530 --> 00:53:18,880
Do you know why I haven't killed Yeok yet?

511
00:53:18,880 --> 00:53:20,620
Because its fun.

512
00:53:20,620 --> 00:53:23,030
Just to stay alive no matter what,

513
00:53:23,030 --> 00:53:28,480
he wears a mask and puts on an act in front of me.

514
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,270
When else could I get another funny spectacle like this?

515
00:53:31,270 --> 00:53:38,200
If he went as far as to inscribe the secret order to abdicate the throne to Yeok, she's someone who'd help Yeok.

516
00:54:23,340 --> 00:54:26,390
Is that what people call 'sacred tree'?

517
00:54:26,390 --> 00:54:31,780
Yes, it's the tree that chases away evil spirits and makes your wish come true.

518
00:54:31,780 --> 00:54:34,930
It's over 200 years old.

519
00:54:34,930 --> 00:54:38,790
There's a headstone there as well, granted by a previous king.

520
00:54:50,860 --> 00:54:55,000
Why did you cast such a heavy mission on me?

521
00:54:56,850 --> 00:55:02,560
How could I choose with my hands, choose the throne?

522
00:55:23,900 --> 00:55:30,370
I am just a lowly woman who wants to live ordinarily.

523
00:55:47,780 --> 00:55:50,650
- Announce me.
- Yes.

524
00:55:55,550 --> 00:55:58,840
The Queen Dowager is here.

525
00:56:05,580 --> 00:56:08,450
You're here, Queen Dowager.

526
00:56:11,140 --> 00:56:13,020
Bring her.

527
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:28,840
How are you running the security in and out of the house?

528
00:56:28,840 --> 00:56:34,310
Some girl has been stealing glances of the house for a while and no one stops her.

529
00:56:34,310 --> 00:56:38,520
I'm innocent. I was just roaming, looking for my relative's home.

530
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:41,790
I have no other foul motives.

531
00:56:41,790 --> 00:56:43,890
The life of someone like me

532
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:49,800
a lowly girl without a hill to lean on, is obvious.

533
00:56:49,800 --> 00:56:53,870
She's a suspicious girl. Take her to the precinct and lock her up.

534
00:56:53,870 --> 00:56:56,060
Please stop.

535
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:01,130
I know this girl.

536
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,770
This girl, you mean?

537
00:57:05,770 --> 00:57:10,430
Yes. She was one of the girls I had with me in Geochang.

538
00:57:10,430 --> 00:57:12,780
I summoned her.

539
00:57:14,310 --> 00:57:18,300
Then I misunderstood.

540
00:57:18,300 --> 00:57:25,540
Lately there are so many unsettling events happening in and out of the capital, so we need to be more than careful.

541
00:57:30,940 --> 00:57:32,930
Miss.

542
00:57:32,930 --> 00:57:36,020
I think it was very hard on you looking for this house.

543
00:57:36,020 --> 00:57:37,760
Nanny.

544
00:57:45,350 --> 00:57:50,780
By the way, what brings you all the way here so early in the morning?

545
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,770
I came to set the date of the marriage consummation.

546
00:57:55,770 --> 00:57:57,390
Pardon?

547
00:58:08,710 --> 00:58:10,660
Come on in.

548
00:58:24,700 --> 00:58:26,780
Have a seat.

549
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,740
You and our Miss met in jail, I hear.

550
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:40,070
Yes. It's such a relief that she remembers.

551
00:58:41,280 --> 00:58:48,880
Our Miss tends to have a selectively good memory and it's always on these matters that her memory is good.

552
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:54,750
But in this house, is it possible to work for room and board instead of an annual salary?

553
00:58:54,750 --> 00:58:59,320
I don't have a reasonable place to stay.

554
00:58:59,320 --> 00:59:03,820
How can we let in someone who goes in and out of the jail?

555
00:59:03,820 --> 00:59:08,420
I am motivated to straighten out my life. Please help me.

556
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:15,100
How did you know our Miss is tender-hearted that a fox like you came to find her?

557
00:59:17,340 --> 00:59:20,210
I was just talking to myself.

558
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,870
Since your health has recovered quite well,

559
00:59:31,870 --> 00:59:35,890
I now think we can prepare for your marriage consummation.

560
00:59:35,890 --> 00:59:37,490
Pardon?

561
00:59:43,210 --> 00:59:45,910
I got the dates already.

562
00:59:46,640 --> 00:59:53,670
When Grand Prince Jin Seong becomes an adult, I should abdicate the royal throne to him. That's the secret order where my royal father's will is written.

563
00:59:53,670 --> 00:59:57,900
The Queen Dowager's palace must be in a fit looking for that right now.

564
00:59:57,900 --> 01:00:02,970
By chance, did you already know?

565
01:00:02,970 --> 01:00:05,810
I don't see Yeok.

566
01:00:07,420 --> 01:00:12,900
Yes. He went out early in the morning on an urgent matter.

567
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:15,340
I see.

568
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:24,370
I hear it's a stress on you that the Grand Prince is so fond of his friends that he goes out frequently.

569
01:00:24,370 --> 01:00:29,310
But once you have a child, he will be home often, right?

570
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:32,550
So you put some work into it.

571
01:00:32,550 --> 01:00:36,840
And I wish to see a grandson who resembles Yeok as well.

572
01:00:39,270 --> 01:00:43,450
Yes, Queen Dowager.

573
01:00:44,840 --> 01:00:51,060
We are family now. Shouldn't we set our addresses straight?

574
01:00:53,550 --> 01:00:58,050
Yes, Royal Mother.

575
01:01:55,640 --> 01:01:57,940
She says she came to look for a job.

576
01:01:57,940 --> 01:02:02,050
Do you really plan to use that girl as a servant?

577
01:02:17,020 --> 01:02:20,070
How in the world?

578
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:22,070
Miss.

579
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:33,750
Miss. Please allow me to work in this house.

580
01:02:34,790 --> 01:02:37,630
I want to serve you, Miss.

581
01:02:37,630 --> 01:02:40,700
In order to find the secret order from me.

582
01:02:40,700 --> 01:02:45,240
Everyone has started to deceive me.

583
01:02:49,020 --> 01:02:50,870
Chae Gyeong.

584
01:03:08,510 --> 01:03:11,370
I greet Your Highness, the Grand Prince.
