1
00:00:42,880 --> 00:00:47,840
 Episode12  
 Bride and Groom, bow to each other!

2
00:00:50,060 --> 00:00:56,960


3
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:02,840
  You said you trust Yeok? I can guarantee that  

4
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:10,790
  you will soon start to suspect him because he is deceiving you. 

5
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:17,200
Bride and Groom, drink the liquor together.

6
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,070
If it's true that he has no news of the scribe,

7
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:22,420
he will go to the rest station because he will be curious about the secret order.

8
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:26,990
If he knows about the scribe's whereabouts,

9
00:02:27,910 --> 00:02:31,290
he will notice that this letter is a fake,

10
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:35,270
and Seo No will run to his father

11
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:40,860
to check his safety.

12
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,460
Seo No.

13
00:02:55,460 --> 00:02:57,030
Father.

14
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,450
- Father. 
 - Seo No! Seo No.

15
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:07,660
Father, are you alright?

16
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,800
I am alright, Seo No.

17
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,880
The Queen Dowager gave her approval, and it is a marriage following a royal order.

18
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,480
However, I wish this marriage will not be a political marriage

19
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,400
but an ordinary one.

20
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:36,250
I fully understand what you're trying to say.

21
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:42,400
From now on, the fate of my Chae Gyeong is up to you.

22
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:46,400
So please live only as my son-in-law,

23
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:51,930
Chae Gyeong's husband, and His Majesty's younger brother.

24
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:55,900
I sincerely ask you.

25
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:12,300
You and my son's fate is really interesting.

26
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:16,710
That it's back to where it started after taking a very long detour. Isn't that so?

27
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:21,760
It is said that everything in the world finds its rightful way.

28
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:26,990
The fact that we are reunited agains after such a long time

29
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:31,780
must mean this is indeed fate, is it not?

30
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:38,750
I am saying I won't repeat the same mistake or wrongdoing.

31
00:04:38,750 --> 00:04:43,770
Thus, please take back the anger from before,

32
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:49,420
and if you have any hate left, please lay it down, Queen Dowager.

33
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:57,620
From olden times, a woman lives chasing her father's wish after birth,

34
00:04:57,620 --> 00:05:02,260
her husband's wish after marriage, and her son's wish after getting older.

35
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:06,670
From now on, can I trust that you will be on the side of Yeok, not of the First Vice Premier,

36
00:05:06,670 --> 00:05:10,900
and live according to Yeok's wishes?

37
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,190
Yes, what I have received and learned from my father till now,

38
00:05:18,190 --> 00:05:23,060
I will share and practice it with my husband in the future.

39
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:31,430
Your Highness, a female physician is here from the royal infirmary.

40
00:05:48,190 --> 00:05:50,040
  Stop!  

41
00:05:52,190 --> 00:05:55,730
The attack was halted midway.

42
00:05:56,830 --> 00:05:59,330
They were after something else.

43
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:03,740
Your Highness the Grand Prince.

44
00:06:03,740 --> 00:06:06,060
Chae Gyeong.

45
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:10,220
Something urgent just came up. I'll be back. See you at home later!

46
00:06:11,210 --> 00:06:16,920
Seeing how he leaves right after the wedding, by chance does he live in two houses?  (T/N: keep a mistress) 

47
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:18,250
Nanny!

48
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:19,940
Or not.

49
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:30,470
Where did Yeok rush off to?

50
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:33,700
I do not know.

51
00:06:33,700 --> 00:06:35,500
Start taking her pulse.

52
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:37,960
Yes, Queen Dowager.

53
00:06:51,430 --> 00:06:52,960
Yeok! Are you okay?

54
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:54,300
Is everything alright?

55
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,260
Where's Seo No?

56
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:57,450
He's not back yet. Why?

57
00:06:57,450 --> 00:07:01,960
I think it's suspicious how they stopped the attack so easily earlier.

58
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:03,800
We may not have been the target in the first place.

59
00:07:03,800 --> 00:07:06,270
Then, what would be the target?

60
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:07,900
Seo No.

61
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:09,670
What?

62
00:07:11,940 --> 00:07:13,610
Seo No!

63
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,000
What about your father?

64
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,770
When I left briefly to get something to eat,

65
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,940
he left this letter and left.

66
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:29,100
There were no other movements? No one was tailing you or anything like that?

67
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:33,030
No, there weren't any suspicious movements.

68
00:07:33,970 --> 00:07:35,640
Did he really just leave?

69
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:39,830
What the heck? He just left like this? Without telling you about the secret order?

70
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:44,940
Yes, that's right. The secret order. When he met you, he didn't talk about it?

71
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:51,570
- We didn't have time. 
 - That's really strange.

72
00:07:51,570 --> 00:07:55,930
It's not like he's mad at his son. Why did he suddenly leave like this?

73
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:50,000
Your Majesty, the Queen Dowager is here.

74
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,980
Tell her to come in.

75
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,840
What brings you here?

76
00:09:03,370 --> 00:09:05,970
It seems like you got injured.

77
00:09:07,910 --> 00:09:11,440
How did you notice that?

78
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:16,980
In a mother and son relationship, it's like a habit.

79
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,920
Even though I saw you from far away, your injury caught my eye.

80
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,050
What a bad habit.

81
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:30,210
How did you get hurt?

82
00:09:30,210 --> 00:09:33,560
I got hurt while hunting.

83
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:38,960
I thought it was a helpless deer, but it turned out to be a wolf.

84
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:44,940
So what happened?

85
00:09:46,090 --> 00:09:48,770
Did you catch the wolf?

86
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:55,020
I will catch it soon. Once I catch it, I will skin its hide

87
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,440
and present it to you, Queen Dowager.

88
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:11,170
You should stop with the act of a worried mother. Please leave.

89
00:10:19,870 --> 00:10:25,000
I don't know what he's plotting. Even his face had been wounded and to stay still like this—

90
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:28,590
By any chance, did it seem like he found out about the secret order?

91
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:33,110
I just got the impression that he's waiting to pick on Yeok.

92
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:39,400
For the time being, I secretly bought off a court lady in the king's chambers.

93
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:44,400
She said she will immediately report if something is out of the ordinary. Let's just wait.

94
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:55,900
I'm only getting married once in my life, just this once!

95
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:16,140
  Something urgent just came up. I'll be back. See you at home later! 

96
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:21,980
  I guarantee that you will soon start to suspect Yeok. 

97
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:24,720
Young Lady!

98
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:40,820
Whether your husband takes this off or whether I take this off, it's the same thing.

99
00:11:40,820 --> 00:11:43,900
Your neck will be hurting. Stay still!

100
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:48,780
- Seriously, that person who's supposed to be your husband—
- Stop!

101
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:52,180
My thoughts are already confused enough as it is.

102
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:54,520
Has it been a month or two since you've been married?

103
00:11:54,520 --> 00:12:00,420
He looks so well-mannered but he acts so...if I were you, I would break both of his legs.

104
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:05,130
Madam, it's Eunuch Song.

105
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:30,030
You're here, Your Majesty.

106
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:37,860
I came because I thought I had prepared everything but it seems I forgot something.

107
00:12:38,420 --> 00:12:41,810
These are herbs and ointments to use in emergencies.

108
00:12:49,570 --> 00:12:54,390
I'm honored, Your Majesty. How did you even think of preparing this?

109
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,890
Recently, there have been many incidents where Yeok has been injured

110
00:12:59,380 --> 00:13:02,300
and it seems those incidents will continue in the future too.

111
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,420
It seems you also had such an incident, Your Majesty.

112
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:18,870
By any chance, did you two fight?

113
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:24,080
Fight? Who fought? Yeok and I?

114
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,160
I heard that brothers grow up fighting each other.

115
00:13:31,870 --> 00:13:33,670
Brothers?

116
00:13:34,280 --> 00:13:38,670
Was Yeok injured too?

117
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:47,650
After the wedding ceremony, I couldn't even take a proper look at his face.

118
00:13:47,650 --> 00:13:52,730
But, did you truly come all the way here to give us that?

119
00:13:52,730 --> 00:13:54,690
Of course not.

120
00:13:54,690 --> 00:14:00,420
Did you forget our promise? You said you would become a spy.

121
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:05,260
Shouldn't I earn His Highness the Grand Prince's trust first?

122
00:14:05,260 --> 00:14:08,790
If I wish to know something from my opponent,

123
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,460
I have to earn his trust first. For now—

124
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:14,220
Rather than earning Yeok's trust,

125
00:14:14,790 --> 00:14:18,560
isn't it more urgent to earn my trust first?

126
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:26,290
You will have to prove that you will not go against my wishes and fulfill your role as a spy.

127
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:31,470
Yesterday, I visited the pawn shop Yeok is said to visit often,

128
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:35,650
but something quite strange happened.

129
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:42,180
When I went to the pawn shop, Yeok definitely wasn't there,

130
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:47,680
but 30 minutes after I left, Yeok came out of the pawn shop.

131
00:14:47,680 --> 00:14:54,020
According to the words of my subordinate who was monitoring the pawn shop, no one entered during that time.

132
00:14:55,400 --> 00:14:59,980
No matter how much I think about it, that pawn shop is suspicious.

133
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:07,670
Aren't you also curious as to what Yeok is hiding?

134
00:15:15,150 --> 00:15:20,800
Still, you never know, so contact the Snail Brides and find Seo No's father.

135
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,240
By the way, what about Ryu Ja Gwang?

136
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:28,460
Did you meet the gisaeng who's supposedly his concubine?

137
00:15:28,460 --> 00:15:30,780
We're planning to finish it up tonight.

138
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:35,350
Yeah, leave Seo No's father and Ryu Ja Gwang to us. Don't worry about this place and go home.

139
00:15:35,350 --> 00:15:38,030
It is your wedding night.

140
00:15:39,740 --> 00:15:41,850
I'm fine.

141
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,950
- Then, please work hard.
- Yes!

142
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,560
It's your first night together, at least buy her some flowers.

143
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:57,480
I heard that if you get on her bad side on your wedding night, you'll have a hard time for the rest of your life.

144
00:15:57,480 --> 00:16:01,720
This is late but congratulations on your marriage, Hyungnim.

145
00:16:03,380 --> 00:16:05,430
I only have you guys.

146
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:45,490
God, you scared me!

147
00:16:48,390 --> 00:16:54,360
You're late. I guess those flowers are a present you brought me to apologize.

148
00:16:59,530 --> 00:17:03,740
W-what a shame, you already changed.

149
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:08,290
Aren't I supposed to take off your ceremonial dress and bridal headpiece?

150
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:11,430
Since when were we the type to care about such etiquette?

151
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:16,440
That was before we were married, isn't it? Now that we are married—

152
00:17:17,290 --> 00:17:19,820
So you came late because we're married now.

153
00:17:19,820 --> 00:17:23,820
Do you already crave your freedom?

154
00:17:23,820 --> 00:17:27,730
My Chae Gyeong, you even know how to tease.

155
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:31,060
I still have a long way to go to catch up to you, my Highness the Grand Prince.

156
00:17:31,060 --> 00:17:35,240
Did you just s-say  my   Highness the Grand Prince?

157
00:17:35,240 --> 00:17:38,450
His Majesty also left us with a present.

158
00:17:38,450 --> 00:17:40,490
Brother—

159
00:17:47,260 --> 00:17:53,180
By any chance, are you sick or injured somewhere?

160
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:55,350
No, I'm fine!

161
00:18:04,560 --> 00:18:09,090
You haven't eaten dinner yet, have you? I'll prepare your meal.

162
00:18:30,590 --> 00:18:35,940
♫  You approached silently  ♫

163
00:18:35,940 --> 00:18:38,390
Did she notice?

164
00:18:38,390 --> 00:18:44,990
♫  You smiled at me while offering your hand  ♫

165
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:51,270
♫  I can't stand the longing now which is growing so  ♫

166
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:55,280
♫ How did I not know ♫

167
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:57,650
Ah... you see, this is...

168
00:18:57,650 --> 00:19:00,630
you remember that, right? Back in the cave, 
 ♫   I can't do anything but leave   ♫

169
00:19:00,630 --> 00:19:05,750
I got injured. Maybe it's because it was a poisoned arrow but— 
 ♫   even if I don't want to go   ♫

170
00:19:05,750 --> 00:19:10,650
right when it's about to heal, it gets worse. 
 ♫   I now know that I can't live without you   ♫

171
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:14,350
Of course. Did I say anything about it?

172
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:18,970
Even if you had told me that this injury was not from the cave months ago,

173
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:23,200
but from something else years ago, I'll believe you.
 ♫   Don't go far away so we can meet again   ♫

174
00:19:23,260 --> 00:19:28,430
Because I can believe how I want, with my own volition.
 ♫  Once again, I love you   ♫

175
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:32,820
The person I want to trust,

176
00:19:32,820 --> 00:19:37,280
I'm only going to trust his words and his heart. 
 ♫   Will you wait for me   ♫

177
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:41,420
Chae Gyeong. 
 ♫   where we first met?   ♫

178
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:43,720
However,

179
00:19:45,290 --> 00:19:50,530
I can't do anything of my own volition about you getting hurt, 
 ♫   for not being able to go there?   ♫

180
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:55,460
so if you can, please don't come back injured. 
 ♫   I can't do anything else but leave even if I don't want to go   ♫

181
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:01,320
It's not because of you; it's because of me.
 ♫  I now know I cannot live without you   ♫

182
00:20:04,190 --> 00:20:06,390
Because it hurts me more.

183
00:20:06,390 --> 00:20:11,660
♫  Don't go away.  I won't be able to see you again.  ♫

184
00:20:11,660 --> 00:20:19,050
♫  I will love you once again.  ♫

185
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:26,290
♫  Forever and ever us.  ♫

186
00:20:26,290 --> 00:20:30,650
  Young Lady, dinner is served! 

187
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,940
  I'm sorry, Seo No. 

188
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:53,660
  I'm leaving your side once again. 

189
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:59,820
  What can we do when the fates of people like us depend on the decisions of those above? 

190
00:21:02,550 --> 00:21:05,770
Father, I brought food...

191
00:21:08,860 --> 00:21:15,250
 You will follow my will and protect Grand Prince Jin Seong. 

192
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:23,770
 Please continue to not waver and walk firmly on your path. 

193
00:21:26,070 --> 00:21:28,860
 My courageous and precious son, 

194
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:32,550
  thank you and I'm sorry. 

195
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:39,660
I was able to have at least one meal with you.

196
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:49,290
Did you leave something here?

197
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:51,030
Yeah.

198
00:21:58,570 --> 00:22:01,190
Why are you looking at me that way?

199
00:22:03,320 --> 00:22:05,260
Is it because of this?

200
00:22:05,260 --> 00:22:09,170
This is just a letter that my father left me. If you can't believe me—

201
00:22:09,170 --> 00:22:11,550
Who said anything to you?

202
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:18,200
I'm pretty sure he was able to leave safely.

203
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:19,380
Pardon?

204
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:23,840
I just said that your father probably left safely.

205
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:28,460
So I'm telling you not to worry.

206
00:23:00,340 --> 00:23:04,730
Could it be that you're getting back at me for being late?

207
00:23:12,430 --> 00:23:17,480
My father told me that the reason why home cooking tastes good is because of my mother.

208
00:23:17,480 --> 00:23:22,870
He said that it tastes good regardless of skill because  of the deep consideration for family that goes into it.

209
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:27,720
I hope you would be like that too, Your Highness.

210
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,390
The meal shouldn't be tasty because of the side dishes

211
00:23:30,390 --> 00:23:33,360
but I would like it to be because I made the side dishes for you.

212
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:37,190
Because it is filled with my feelings for you.

213
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:44,000
Alright. I will come home and eat a home cooked meal no matter what.

214
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:52,430
You probably are the one that thinks about me the most in this whole world

215
00:23:52,430 --> 00:23:55,800
so the rice you cook for me will be the best in the world.

216
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:08,330
Gosh.

217
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:27,150
All those eyes are just there to spy on my lady and her husband.

218
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:30,160
I should just teach them a lesson.

219
00:24:40,500 --> 00:24:45,830
Just as you said, when I followed the scribe's son, he was meeting his father.

220
00:24:45,830 --> 00:24:50,340
I thought that if the Grand Prince Jin Seong found out, it would be another headache.

221
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:53,970
So I gave instructions to take care of it quietly.

222
00:25:18,460 --> 00:25:20,920
Your Majesty.

223
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:26,320
If this was five years ago

224
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,190
no matter what you cooked up

225
00:25:29,190 --> 00:25:32,740
I would've probably listened to you.

226
00:25:32,740 --> 00:25:35,020
Today, I

227
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:39,360
met you out of all people

228
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:42,790
so it has became difficult for me to show mercy.

229
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:46,820
You hid the secret order,

230
00:25:46,820 --> 00:25:50,980
and while you were on the run for all those years

231
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:56,160
I... Do you know what in the world I have done?!

232
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,890
Where is the secret order?!!!

233
00:26:09,860 --> 00:26:15,160
I will only prepare your bed and then I will leave.

234
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,760
Leaving? Where to?

235
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,030
My room is in the building all the way over there.

236
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,670
Are you saying that we're going to be sleeping in separate rooms starting from our first day of marriage?

237
00:26:24,670 --> 00:26:29,000
Yes. The Queen Dowager made a firm request regarding this.

238
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:31,990
She told me that we should only sleep together on a certain specified date.

239
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,600
Why did my mother say that?!

240
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,270
After the wedding was over I was treated by a royal court nurse

241
00:26:36,270 --> 00:26:39,900
and she said that I should drink some herbal tonic then work on preparing my body for...

242
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:48,230
Well, in any case, you would have slept alone tonight even if it weren't for that.

243
00:26:51,670 --> 00:26:53,730
Please get out of the way.

244
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:06,000
You'll definitely regret it later while you're kicking your blanket.

245
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:09,130
Wouldn't it better kicking the blanket instead of you?

246
00:27:09,130 --> 00:27:12,890
Chae Gyeong. I mean, my wife.

247
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:22,110
I don't care. Whatever.

248
00:27:22,110 --> 00:27:26,330
You should change before you lay down—

249
00:27:28,630 --> 00:27:33,970
They say that men become like little babies after they get married. Are you already getting started?

250
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:42,840
Isn't a wife supposed to be with her husband after she gets married?

251
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:49,670
You should take care of that on your own, Your Highness. I'll be going then.

252
00:27:51,590 --> 00:27:53,870
Chae Gyeong...

253
00:27:56,330 --> 00:27:59,330
Let's stay together, okay?

254
00:28:15,400 --> 00:28:18,180
I will sleep here in your place

255
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:21,630
so please sleep over there my lady. Please.

256
00:28:22,870 --> 00:28:26,670
You didn't know about this did you?

257
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:04,000
Are you going to continue to stay like that?

258
00:29:04,870 --> 00:29:11,170
Didn't I tell you that I will be leaving as soon as you fall asleep, Your Highness?

259
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:16,800
Hurry and go to sleep.
♫   Leave comfortably   ♫

260
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:23,730
♫   You are waking up from a harsh dream  ♫

261
00:29:23,730 --> 00:29:29,150
This just won't do. I should go back to my room—

262
00:29:29,150 --> 00:29:33,530
Grand Prince, you promised me that we will just be together and not...

263
00:29:33,530 --> 00:29:38,440
Did I say anything to you?

264
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:43,210
I'm off to sleep now.

265
00:29:43,210 --> 00:29:49,200
♫  Just think that you're drenched with the sunset  ♫

266
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:55,410
♫   It's okay, leave comfortably  ♫

267
00:29:55,410 --> 00:29:59,130
 It won't take long for you to become suspicious of Yeok. 

268
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:05,800
 It's because Yeok is deceiving you. 

269
00:30:05,800 --> 00:30:12,040
 I'm not being deceived by the Grand Prince right now. I am just waiting for him. 

270
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:17,010
 It's not a lie just because the truth arrives a bit late. 

271
00:30:17,010 --> 00:30:21,070
♫  My dear, My dear you will   ♫

272
00:30:21,070 --> 00:30:26,470
♫  light up my love in the night sky every day  ♫

273
00:30:26,470 --> 00:30:32,140
♫  Yearn and yearn. If you can't forget  ♫

274
00:30:32,140 --> 00:30:36,100
♫   When the moonlight shines down  ♫

275
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:39,340
♫   please remember me  ♫

276
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:47,110
♫  Every now and then  ♫

277
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,830
♫  Please think of me  ♫

278
00:30:50,830 --> 00:30:53,010
Why...

279
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:56,220
How...

280
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,570
Why did you get hurt?

281
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,470
I asked where the secret order was!!!!

282
00:31:10,470 --> 00:31:14,010
Your Majesty, at this rate, he'll die without telling you anything.

283
00:31:14,010 --> 00:31:16,040
Please calm down.

284
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:18,910
I will ask you one last time.

285
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:25,440
If you don't answer me now, I will capture your son and kill him.

286
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,500
Will you tell me now?

287
00:31:28,500 --> 00:31:32,010
Y-Your Majesty.

288
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:35,010
Please spare

289
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,910
my son's life.

290
00:31:40,550 --> 00:31:47,170
My son really doesn't know anything.

291
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:54,020
The crime he committed when he was young and the debt that he carries in his heart

292
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:59,510
are the only reasons why he is looking after His Highness the Grand Prince.

293
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:12,510
I will tell you everything.

294
00:32:19,710 --> 00:32:23,850
That's right. This is what being a father is all about.

295
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:27,670
- Your Majesty. 
 - This is what being a father is all about for sure.

296
00:32:27,670 --> 00:32:32,760
A father should do anything to save his child's life. This is what a father is supposed to be.

297
00:32:33,510 --> 00:32:38,700
But why was my father so harsh?

298
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:45,990
But why did my father leave a secret order to kill me?! Exactly why?!

299
00:32:45,990 --> 00:32:49,900
It was for Joseon.

300
00:32:49,900 --> 00:32:57,050
The King alone cannot lead the country and its people.

301
00:32:57,050 --> 00:33:05,490
He said the ruler must be someone who receives the support of the Court officials.

302
00:33:05,490 --> 00:33:12,070
The late king did not make this decision as a father,

303
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,360
but this decision was made as the king of a nation—

304
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:17,400
Stop with the nonsense!

305
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,300
The secret order is...

306
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:25,420
The secret order is engraved on a woman's body.

307
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:31,500
A woman? Engraved on a woman's body?

308
00:33:31,500 --> 00:33:33,700
Who is that woman?

309
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:39,590
Please look for women around the late king.

310
00:33:39,590 --> 00:33:44,080
I don't know anything else.

311
00:33:46,840 --> 00:33:49,760
Fine. I will believe you.

312
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:54,860
However, no other person must know about this.

313
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,500
Thus,

314
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:07,190
just leave.

315
00:34:14,340 --> 00:34:22,660
This is why you can't be the king, Your Majesty.

316
00:35:09,430 --> 00:35:10,510
It works!

317
00:35:10,510 --> 00:35:15,400
- Father, you try too.
- Goodness, Father can't do it.

318
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,880
Are you alright?

319
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:19,550
- Father.
- Goodness!

320
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:28,500
I must hunt here tomorrow.

321
00:35:28,500 --> 00:35:34,560
Demolish this neighborhood right away and make it into a hunting ground.

322
00:35:35,900 --> 00:35:42,180
Get rid of everything. All of it!

323
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:56,820
Petitions against the Deputy Minister of Defense Ryu Ja Gwang are flooding in.

324
00:35:56,820 --> 00:36:02,500
These are statements testifying that he extorted abalone, oysters and clams from fishermen for personal gain.

325
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:07,030
Your Majesty, all of those were offered to you.

326
00:36:07,030 --> 00:36:08,970
You usually enjoy eating—

327
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:13,800
I don't remember that I enjoyed eating them.

328
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:17,360
Your Majesty, this was all from a loyal heart—

329
00:36:17,360 --> 00:36:20,930
First Vice Premier, in such a case what is the crime

330
00:36:20,930 --> 00:36:23,450
and its punishment?

331
00:36:23,450 --> 00:36:25,370
The crime of accepting bribes in government office is applied and

332
00:36:25,370 --> 00:36:30,670
his government post can be taken away and he could receive flogging or be sent into exile afterwards.

333
00:36:30,670 --> 00:36:34,230
- Deputy Minister Yu.
 - Yes, Your Majesty.

334
00:36:34,230 --> 00:36:37,620
Do you want to receive a flogging or be exiled?

335
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:40,950
Your Majesty, this is your servant Ryu Ja Gwang.

336
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:43,840
How can you abandon me?

337
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,780
Do you want to do both?

338
00:36:49,310 --> 00:36:52,040
I will go into exile.

339
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:11,660
I am too tired today and won't be attending the Court Session.

340
00:37:32,910 --> 00:37:37,720
Did you write the impeachment petition regarding the Deputy Minster of Defense?

341
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:44,820
I was the representative who wrote the petition, but there were many court officials who shared my view.

342
00:37:44,820 --> 00:37:46,850
I am aware of that.

343
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:53,100
What I want to know is how you were able to know everything in such detail.

344
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:56,940
The ones who first told me about it were the Snail Brides.

345
00:37:56,940 --> 00:38:01,650
The ones who investigated this matter were me and the inspectors from the Office of the Inspector General.

346
00:38:02,530 --> 00:38:04,600
Snail Brides...

347
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:09,060
 Deputy Minister of Defense: Ryu Ja Gwang 

348
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:14,440
Occasionally bulletins announcing court officials' or 
 

349
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:19,110
a powerful family's corruption are being posted in and out of the capital.

350
00:38:20,260 --> 00:38:25,200
The people will believe anything the Snail Brides say.

351
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:29,310
Since it was not the King nor the Court officials

352
00:38:29,310 --> 00:38:32,360
but the Snail Brides who saved people by giving out rice

353
00:38:32,360 --> 00:38:35,730
when they were dying from the famine.

354
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:51,610
Recently, I've been hearing about the Snail Brides a lot.

355
00:38:51,610 --> 00:39:00,600
Those Snail Brides appeared at the same time when Grand Prince Jin Seong came to the capital.

356
00:39:01,810 --> 00:39:06,340
Do you happen to know anything else?

357
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,170
Yes, I do.

358
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:12,450
I know very well that you're trying to muddle the King's mind these days

359
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:16,630
and doing everything you can to turn him into a stupid king.

360
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:20,280
Please restrain yourself.

361
00:39:28,420 --> 00:39:30,300
It must not be Grand Prince Jin Seong.

362
00:39:30,300 --> 00:39:34,050
Yes, it must not be him. It probably isn't him.

363
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:38,420
But, isn't it a situation we cannot ignore?

364
00:39:38,420 --> 00:39:44,650
They are just the people's savior for now, but what if the Grand Prince Jin Seong belongs to this organization?

365
00:39:45,870 --> 00:39:50,920
Anyhow, you must not be easily swayed by such things

366
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:53,480
and you must hold firm.

367
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:57,870
I will find more about the Snail Brides and take action.

368
00:40:02,890 --> 00:40:06,270
 That pawn shop seems suspicious. 

369
00:40:06,270 --> 00:40:11,780
 Aren't you also curious about what Yeok is hiding? 

370
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:17,430
 As soon as you find out, come to the backyard of Jangwonseo  (Department of plants and fruits)  in the palace immediately. 

371
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:31,130
You did it, you did it.

372
00:40:32,960 --> 00:40:36,890
You couldn't do it, you couldn't do it. It was in vain again today?

373
00:40:38,130 --> 00:40:42,550
I told you it won't happen anytime soon. The Queen Dowager requested it too.

374
00:40:42,550 --> 00:40:45,690
What kind of nonsense is that? If you're married,

375
00:40:45,690 --> 00:40:49,980
that is just like a duty.

376
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:55,190
The same goes for you. You need to put in the effort.

377
00:40:55,190 --> 00:40:57,980
- Does it work by making an effort? 
 - Of course.

378
00:40:57,980 --> 00:41:02,660
First, you need to have some liquor ready,

379
00:41:02,660 --> 00:41:07,000
and say "You're here, husband" and with your eyes like this,

380
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:09,150
look up seductively

381
00:41:09,150 --> 00:41:12,000
and feed him alcohol and heat will rise up.

382
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,230
- Then... 
 - Then?

383
00:41:14,230 --> 00:41:15,520
Then?

384
00:41:15,520 --> 00:41:20,580
Then... ask who was your first love? What number am I?

385
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:23,990
Say "I'm fine with it" and ask him questions carefully.

386
00:41:23,990 --> 00:41:25,560
Then he will fess up.

387
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:29,940
At that time, sum up the situation and take the lead...

388
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,320
What am I saying?

389
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:34,010
Yes, that's it.

390
00:41:34,010 --> 00:41:35,800
What? What is?

391
00:41:35,800 --> 00:41:39,170
Nanny, give me liquor. Everything you have.

392
00:41:39,170 --> 00:41:41,140
What? Everything?

393
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:44,120
If he drinks all the liquor, he'll fall asleep immediately and he won't be able to do anything.

394
00:41:44,120 --> 00:41:49,020
Yes, so he won't be able to do anything. While you're at it, the strongest one, so he'll get drunk quickly.

395
00:41:49,020 --> 00:41:50,930
Quickly?

396
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,410
My lady.

397
00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:23,980
Seo No, you were here too! Here you go.

398
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:30,620
Everyone, you're working hard, aren't you?

399
00:42:30,620 --> 00:42:33,320
How about a drink?

400
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:38,220
Chae Gyeong.

401
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,360
Your Highness.

402
00:42:40,360 --> 00:42:43,690
Gosh, how improper. What do you mean by Your Highness?

403
00:42:43,690 --> 00:42:47,500
If you've married, you should maintain the proper formalities.

404
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:55,010
When you say formalities, do you mean stuff like "Husband" and "Wife"?

405
00:42:55,010 --> 00:43:02,120
Is that something... calling him "husband" that easy?

406
00:43:02,120 --> 00:43:06,280
Yes it is.

407
00:43:06,280 --> 00:43:09,120
♫   It's you  ♫

408
00:43:09,120 --> 00:43:14,150
♫  But I know that you'll never love me the way that I love you baby, baby  ♫

409
00:43:14,150 --> 00:43:16,700
W-w-wife.

410
00:43:16,700 --> 00:43:18,690
You're doing well.

411
00:43:19,870 --> 00:43:21,920
My greetings were late, Madam.

412
00:43:21,920 --> 00:43:24,340
I am the Grand Prince's testicular friend—
(slang for best friend)

413
00:43:25,260 --> 00:43:29,420
No, best friend Baek Seok Hee. Young Master Baek.

414
00:43:29,420 --> 00:43:32,930
Yes, please call me Young Master Jo.

415
00:43:32,930 --> 00:43:36,310
Please take good care of me. I am Sin Chae Gyeong.

416
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:40,180
More?

417
00:43:40,690 --> 00:43:43,140
This is called Jin Dong Joo.

418
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,270
It is a precious liquor that even the late King treasured.

419
00:43:46,270 --> 00:43:48,150
Have some.

420
00:43:49,590 --> 00:43:52,360
Although I haven't been able to drink it, I have heard of it.

421
00:43:52,360 --> 00:43:53,880
Jin Dong Joo.

422
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:59,770
Our Yeok got married to the right woman! Thank you, Young Lady!

423
00:44:02,100 --> 00:44:06,800
Are you here to nag because I come in late every night?

424
00:44:06,830 --> 00:44:09,230
What do you mean nag? Since you're working so hard,

425
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:11,730
I just came to cheer you on.

426
00:44:12,530 --> 00:44:17,150
Wow, as expected of royal alcohol! The way it goes down your throat is different!

427
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,670
Seo No, why aren't you drinking?

428
00:44:20,670 --> 00:44:23,510
I think I have to stop drinking now...

429
00:44:23,510 --> 00:44:25,420
Hey, you're making me sad.

430
00:44:25,420 --> 00:44:27,990
If you don't drink on such a nice day like today, when will you get drunk again?

431
00:44:27,990 --> 00:44:32,030
Your Highness the Grand Prince, should we friends drink?

432
00:44:36,260 --> 00:44:39,220
  I will just look around 

433
00:44:39,220 --> 00:44:42,610
  and tell His Majesty the King that there is nothing here, that he shouldn't be suspicious, 

434
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:45,350
  confidently. 

435
00:44:55,340 --> 00:44:57,680
Are they together right now?

436
00:44:57,680 --> 00:44:59,610
Pardon?

437
00:45:00,090 --> 00:45:04,030
Yes, I am beside you right now, Your Majesty.

438
00:45:04,030 --> 00:45:07,060
I'm talking about Chae Gyeong.

439
00:45:07,060 --> 00:45:10,690
Is she with Yeok right now?

440
00:45:13,150 --> 00:45:19,740
Of course she is, they're married now.

441
00:45:23,720 --> 00:45:28,690
Then their misfortune

442
00:45:28,690 --> 00:45:32,020
will soon begin.

443
00:45:33,650 --> 00:45:40,270
A married couple is a relationship which cannot be happy.

444
00:45:40,270 --> 00:45:45,080
You have to suspect, argue with,

445
00:45:45,080 --> 00:45:47,660
and hate each other.

446
00:45:59,970 --> 00:46:02,340
  Mother, I'm healthy. 

447
00:46:02,340 --> 00:46:06,440
  No, you're not! You're sick right now. 

448
00:46:06,440 --> 00:46:10,230
  You've suffered from nightmares and nosebleeds every night, that's the reason I urgently brought you here. 

449
00:46:10,230 --> 00:46:12,010
  Come on, let's go. 

450
00:46:19,270 --> 00:46:22,560
  Your Highness the Queen, you can't! 

451
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:28,210
  Your Majesty, the prince is very sick. 

452
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:29,900
  Please take care of him. 

453
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:31,380
  Queen. 

454
00:46:31,380 --> 00:46:33,790
  He's at an age where he needs his father's care. 

455
00:46:33,790 --> 00:46:38,910
 So you rudely entered my sleeping quarters? 

456
00:46:38,910 --> 00:46:41,450
  Leave immediately. 

457
00:46:41,450 --> 00:46:45,800
  If I do not visit you like this, it's difficult to see you at all. 

458
00:46:45,800 --> 00:46:50,840
  Even if you are busy with this nation's affairs, you need to take care of your family first. 

459
00:46:54,080 --> 00:46:55,950
 Your Highness the Prince, 

460
00:46:57,600 --> 00:47:01,830
 please come here. Let me see where you are ill. 

461
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:14,720
  Your Highness the Queen! 

462
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:19,260
 That's right! I am his mother and the queen of this nation. 

463
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:23,440
 So get out of the way. This is not where you should be. 

464
00:47:25,870 --> 00:47:28,000
My mother who used me as an excuse

465
00:47:28,000 --> 00:47:31,980
to intrude into my father's sleeping quarters

466
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:36,980
was really embarrassing and resentful.

467
00:47:36,980 --> 00:47:41,650
But now, I know.

468
00:47:42,770 --> 00:47:49,710
My mother was human too.

469
00:47:49,710 --> 00:47:54,340
A human who wanted to be loved by the person she loved.

470
00:47:54,340 --> 00:47:59,660
Before she was the Queen of Joseon,

471
00:47:59,660 --> 00:48:04,830
she wanted to live as her man's wife, a woman.

472
00:48:07,480 --> 00:48:10,280
Your Majesty.

473
00:48:10,280 --> 00:48:14,950
Therefore, I became quite curious.

474
00:48:14,950 --> 00:48:20,660
Do I want to live as the King

475
00:48:20,660 --> 00:48:26,420
or as the man

476
00:48:26,420 --> 00:48:29,680
of the woman I love?

477
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,460
Your Majesty.

478
00:48:35,880 --> 00:48:40,960
Your Majesty, I have brought the women.

479
00:48:52,450 --> 00:48:55,990
We greet you, Your Majesty.

480
00:48:58,010 --> 00:49:03,980
These are the palace maids that waited on the late king.

481
00:49:05,650 --> 00:49:08,590
I will take my leave now.

482
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:19,070
Undress them.

483
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:53,540
You look similar to her;

484
00:49:53,540 --> 00:49:57,340
your forehead, cheeks, and the bridge of your nose.

485
00:49:57,340 --> 00:50:00,520
What do you mean by looking similar, Your Majesty? These women are

486
00:50:03,040 --> 00:50:06,670
summoned to look for the engraved message.

487
00:50:08,110 --> 00:50:12,800
Will you wait on me as my mistress tonight?

488
00:50:43,330 --> 00:50:45,720
Don't be afraid.

489
00:50:47,190 --> 00:50:49,470
I won't hurt you.

490
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,550
I have some alcohol left at home.

491
00:51:13,550 --> 00:51:16,790
I'll bring it...

492
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:21,270
Hey, Yeok! Buy some boiled pork on your way back!

493
00:51:21,270 --> 00:51:23,590
Buy some boiled pork!

494
00:51:30,270 --> 00:51:36,040
- Have you already reached your limits? Have one more drink.
- Yes!

495
00:51:44,180 --> 00:51:45,090
I hope you have good business!

496
00:51:45,090 --> 00:51:46,860
Yes, be safe on your way back!

497
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:50,050
We have many precious items, please take a look!

498
00:51:50,050 --> 00:51:51,420
Come, take a look!

499
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:55,270
Take a look at some precious items!

500
00:51:56,800 --> 00:52:00,270
Wow, it's pretty.

501
00:52:00,270 --> 00:52:04,890
I have a lot of precious merchandise. Take a look.

502
00:52:04,890 --> 00:52:09,090
For starters, take a look. It's good merchandise.

503
00:52:14,810 --> 00:52:17,990
  Something quite strange happened. 

504
00:52:17,990 --> 00:52:20,600
  When I went to the pawn shop, 

505
00:52:20,600 --> 00:52:23,930
  Yeok was definitely not there, 

506
00:52:23,930 --> 00:52:26,390
  but 30 minutes after I left, 

507
00:52:26,390 --> 00:52:29,660
  Yeok came out of the pawn shop. 

508
00:52:30,900 --> 00:52:36,300
Don't you also wonder what Yeok is hiding?

509
00:52:41,950 --> 00:52:44,200
What am I doing?

510
00:52:47,560 --> 00:52:50,920
What am I doing right now? It's not like I am a thief.

511
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:55,720
Even though I am curious, I shouldn't be like this. I said I would trust him.

512
00:53:07,070 --> 00:53:09,130
Grand Prince.

513
00:53:28,350 --> 00:53:31,790
Can we just...

514
00:53:31,790 --> 00:53:35,240
go down to Geochang and live together?

515
00:53:35,240 --> 00:53:38,140
Let's go down to Geochang and...

516
00:53:38,140 --> 00:53:40,990
Let's farm and...

517
00:53:40,990 --> 00:53:43,580
Let's live like that. 
 ♫   Suddenly you were there  ♫

518
00:53:44,700 --> 00:53:49,290
♫   without a sound   ♫

519
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:51,940
Alright. 
 ♫   The first moment I saw you, I was so nervous  ♫

520
00:53:51,940 --> 00:53:57,200
Let's do that. 
 ♫  I couldn't bring myself to look at your eyes  ♫

521
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,920
♫   What should I do now?   ♫

522
00:53:59,920 --> 00:54:04,150
♫   I feel as if my breath will stop   ♫

523
00:54:07,720 --> 00:54:11,530
♫   I want to hold you, the one   ♫

524
00:54:11,530 --> 00:54:15,520
♫   whose brilliance chills my heart   ♫

525
00:54:15,520 --> 00:54:19,250
♫   I'm afraid you might fly away   ♫

526
00:54:19,250 --> 00:54:23,240
♫   when the wind blows   ♫

527
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,070
Why do you suddenly want to take a bath in the middle of the night?

528
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:38,970
♫   I will always love only you   ♫

529
00:54:57,180 --> 00:54:59,070
What was that?

530
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:00,850
What was that sound?

531
00:55:01,820 --> 00:55:02,930
What sound is this?

532
00:55:02,930 --> 00:55:05,700
What's going on here?

533
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:12,860
- What?
- What is this?

534
00:55:12,860 --> 00:55:14,890
What is this?

535
00:55:49,210 --> 00:55:50,920
Father...

536
00:56:03,190 --> 00:56:04,780
Father...

537
00:56:10,210 --> 00:56:12,150
Father!

538
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:27,270
  Exactly what happened? Why have you been in hiding until now? 

539
00:56:28,700 --> 00:56:32,470
  Is it because of the secret order? 

540
00:56:32,470 --> 00:56:36,600
  Now, you know. Yes... 

541
00:56:39,690 --> 00:56:44,430
  it's because of the secret order. The late King's will, 

542
00:56:44,430 --> 00:56:51,200
  no, to speak frankly, it was not a will but 

543
00:56:51,200 --> 00:56:54,410
 a secret word. 

544
00:56:55,170 --> 00:57:00,090
 Because it was immediately drawn up on the night you were born 

545
00:57:00,090 --> 00:57:03,430
 and I was ordered to preserve it in secrecy 

546
00:57:03,430 --> 00:57:09,990
  so that when Your Highness became an adult, you would be able to come find it. 

547
00:57:09,990 --> 00:57:11,750
  When you became an adult, 

548
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:16,830
  it would become your strength. 

549
00:57:16,830 --> 00:57:23,410
  Where is that secret order? 

550
00:57:30,430 --> 00:57:33,110
  The location where the secret order is stored... 

551
00:57:33,110 --> 00:57:38,370
 It is written on a woman's body, 

552
00:57:39,820 --> 00:57:43,440
  and that woman is... 

553
00:58:01,820 --> 00:58:07,350
I'll sleep here tonight

554
00:58:08,130 --> 00:58:12,670
and keep it a secret from Her Highness the Queen Dowager.

555
00:58:42,290 --> 00:58:44,420
  Your Highness the Grand Prince! 

556
00:58:48,450 --> 00:58:49,830
Seok Hee!

557
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:52,750
Your Highness the Grand Prince, Your Highness!

558
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:57,370
There are too many eyes watching here. What's the matter?

559
00:58:57,370 --> 00:59:01,050
Seo No's father has died.

560
00:59:01,050 --> 00:59:02,050
What?

561
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:06,910
He returned as a corpse. He was abandoned in front of the pawn shop.

562
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:17,670
Something urgent happened at the pawn shop. I'll be back soon!

563
00:59:23,150 --> 00:59:27,020
Madam, is something wrong?

564
00:59:27,020 --> 00:59:29,160
No, it's nothing.

565
00:59:59,620 --> 01:00:04,150
  Something urgent happened at the pawn shop. I'll be back soon! 

566
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:13,010


567
01:00:44,810 --> 01:00:48,610
  This, try this on! 

568
01:00:48,610 --> 01:00:51,570
  Is it too small? 

569
01:00:51,570 --> 01:00:57,340
  What are you talking about? These days, you have to at least wear clothes this tight to be called "cool". 

570
01:00:57,340 --> 01:01:01,390
  You grew up so well! 

571
01:01:05,890 --> 01:01:08,720
  Since you are following my will and decision 

572
01:01:08,720 --> 01:01:13,180
  in protecting Grand Prince Jin Seong, 

573
01:01:13,180 --> 01:01:16,750
  please continue not to waver 

574
01:01:16,750 --> 01:01:20,250
  and firmly walk on your path. 

575
01:01:20,250 --> 01:01:23,050
  My courageous and precious son, 

576
01:01:23,050 --> 01:01:26,560
  thank you and I'm sorry. 

577
01:02:56,850 --> 01:03:03,190
 The moment Yeok has a will of his own, it is a traitorous mind and everything he does 

578
01:03:03,190 --> 01:03:06,300
  is something that contributes to treason. 

579
01:03:16,270 --> 01:03:18,480
 Lee Yoong 

580
01:03:19,290 --> 01:03:21,600
I'm sorry, Seo No.

581
01:03:26,050 --> 01:03:28,690
I couldn't protect him.

582
01:03:32,130 --> 01:03:41,720
Then, become King as soon as possible.

583
01:03:41,720 --> 01:03:47,200
When you become King, you can protect the people who are still alive.

584
01:03:47,850 --> 01:03:57,660
Ensure that no one else dies a wrongful death like my father.

585
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,650
 King, Lee Yoong 

586
01:04:19,620 --> 01:04:22,720
  You said you trust Yeok? 

587
01:04:23,540 --> 01:04:25,850
   

588
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:29,020
   

589
01:04:36,510 --> 01:04:42,310
  The same goes for you. It's still not too late. This is your last chance. 

590
01:04:43,860 --> 01:04:49,900
  If you are afraid or regretful, you can stop here.
