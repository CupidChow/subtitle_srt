00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,820
  Episode 18  

2
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:58,550
I-is anyone there?

3
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,370
Chae Gyeong, I am here.

4
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:14,470
You must have waited long.

5
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:23,170
♫  You approached silently  ♫

6
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:32,290
♫  You smiled at me while offering your hand  ♫

7
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:39,070
♫  The time we spent together  ♫

8
00:01:39,070 --> 00:01:45,370
♫  Is going far away like a dream  ♫

9
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:49,900
Have you already forgotten how it feels to be touched by me?

10
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,780
♫  I can't stand the longing now which is growing so  ♫

11
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:59,960
♫  Why didn't I know loving would be that?  ♫

12
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:07,720
♫  I can't do anything else but leave even though I don't want to go  ♫

13
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:15,260
♫  I know now that I can't live without you  ♫

14
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,190
I've missed you.

15
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:21,580
Then why did you come so late?

16
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:25,200
I've waited too long.

17
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:33,450
I am sorry.

18
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,440
How is your foot?

19
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:41,940
It's all better.

20
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,960
Really?

21
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:50,280
Royal Mother took measures beforehand so I was able to avoid a severe injury.

22
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,660
I didn't know.

23
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:00,210
I was worried you might not be able to stand up or walk.

24
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:03,690
Then how would you eat or use the bathroom?

25
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:06,750
I was worried and lost sleep over it.

26
00:03:06,750 --> 00:03:09,120
You should have told me beforehand.

27
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,430
That you'll be able to walk, that it won't be serious. You should have told me beforehand.

28
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:16,530
I am sorry about that too.

29
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,540
I am sorry that

30
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,840
I keep on saying sorry, Chae Gyeong.

31
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:42,960
Grand Prince Jin Seong just entered the palace. Did something happen?

32
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:48,450
He said he will join us after securing the safety of his family members in the palace.

33
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,130
The rebel forces will enter the capital soon.

34
00:03:51,130 --> 00:03:54,230
We have to escort the Grand Prince Jin Seong out of the palace first.

35
00:03:54,230 --> 00:03:58,050
Let's hurry and call the Capital Defense troops.

36
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,350
However, Chae Gyeong.

37
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:02,670
I know what you're going to say.

38
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:05,750
If you have entered the palace again,

39
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:10,060
you must have already decided and prepared for something.

40
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:14,820
If I say it was a decision to save you, us, our family,

41
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:20,450
and furthermore, the people of Joseon,

42
00:04:21,170 --> 00:04:23,200
will you believe me?

43
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:30,440
I am sorry but I don't think I will be able to give you my answer now.

44
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,460
After you complete your task well,

45
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:39,650
after that, please carry out your goals into actions.

46
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:44,290
If you keep me and my family safe,

47
00:04:44,290 --> 00:04:47,840
I will naturally come to believe and support you.

48
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:52,490
Right. Alright.

49
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,410
Have you met my parents?

50
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:11,620
 Father-in-law. 

51
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:15,980
 As the king's subject and as his family, I ask for forgiveness on his behalf. 

52
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:18,970
 It's not time for you to beg for forgiveness. 

53
00:05:18,970 --> 00:05:22,170
 You should advise and scold the king, 

54
00:05:22,170 --> 00:05:24,630
 and if you still don't succeed, it's time for you to abandon the king. 

55
00:05:24,630 --> 00:05:29,630
 Which subject in the world would think of abandoning his lord? 

56
00:05:30,300 --> 00:05:34,160
 After protecting his lord as long as he can, 

57
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:38,730
 if he still doesn't succeed, he will die fighting for his king. 

58
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:41,550
 This is the fate of a subject. 

59
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:45,470
 Then how about Chae Gyeong? Are you going to abandon your daughter? 

60
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,970
 Your lord has Chae Gyeong imprisoned in the palace as a hostage. 

61
00:05:49,970 --> 00:05:52,990
 Still, you can say such things? 

62
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:57,370
 You must protect Chae Gyeong, Grand Prince. She's your wife! 

63
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:04,600
 I am no longer related to Chae Gyeong. 

64
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,600
Rather, you don't have to dwell on me and my family.

65
00:06:12,660 --> 00:06:14,590
I've met him.

66
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,200
I am relying on you.

67
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,210
Yes, Your Highness, the Grand Prince.

68
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:36,970
 Chae Gyeong is my wife. I will keep that in mind. 

69
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,780
 Deed for house and land. 

70
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:46,470
 Have you met my parents? 

71
00:06:47,380 --> 00:06:49,240
 I've met them. 

72
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,040
 That's why 

73
00:06:54,020 --> 00:06:58,600
 you have to leave the palace now, and take your parents to a safe place. 

74
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:01,160
 Once the revolt begins, 

75
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:06,310
 the king's closest subjects and his in-laws will be in the most danger. 

76
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:10,640
 Property sales transaction record 

77
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:13,030
 I've found a place for you to go to. 

78
00:07:13,730 --> 00:07:17,160
 I have to make a decision now. 

79
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,940
Lady, you have to hurry.

80
00:07:21,940 --> 00:07:23,270
Just pack lightly.

81
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:25,080
I understand.

82
00:07:25,660 --> 00:07:29,230
His Majesty is entering.

83
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,500
Really delicious grapes have been provided as a royal offering, so I brought them here for you to taste.

84
00:07:47,460 --> 00:07:49,740
Your subject does not deserve such grace.

85
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:52,940
Did you eat dinner?

86
00:07:53,850 --> 00:07:56,130
I don't have an appetite.

87
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:01,590
I told you that you can't live or die as you wish.

88
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:05,590
Thus, not eating dinner is disobeying the royal command.

89
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,410
Do you really need to get punished before you come to your senses?

90
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:11,320
I am sorry.

91
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,580
If it's stuffy to stay in the palace,

92
00:08:15,580 --> 00:08:20,360
do you want to go for a night hunt with me?

93
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:23,730
It will be fun to watch.

94
00:08:23,730 --> 00:08:25,950
Hunting?

95
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:29,160
You want to go outside the palace?

96
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,880
 What do you plan to do? 

97
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,570
 Once the king hears the rebel forces have arrived at the capital, 

98
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:38,300
 he will send out the troops of the Defense Ministry. 

99
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:42,190
 Then, there will only be the Royal Guards remaining in the palace. 

100
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:46,620
 At that time, I will have a talk with the king. 

101
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,650
 When will the rebel forces arrive? 

102
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:53,290
 It will take about half a day. 

103
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:58,280
Do you want to come with me?

104
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:05,530
If it's for me, there is something I want to do more than hunting.

105
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:10,230
Can you grant it?

106
00:09:15,140 --> 00:09:18,370
Sure. What is it?

107
00:09:21,250 --> 00:09:23,720
I want to watch the moon.

108
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,010
You want to watch the moon?

109
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,960
Last time in his letter, my father

110
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:33,810
said the moon that can be seen from Gyeonghoeru Pavillion is very beautiful and he misses that.

111
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:41,830
Right. Today's weather is better suited to watch the moon than to go hunting.

112
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,630
Your subject does not deserve such grace.

113
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:46,580
I will leave after putting my outerwear.

114
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:59,860
I will stall for time by keeping the king in the palace.

115
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,500
However, it's dangerous.

116
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:06,440
If not, all of the Grand Prince's plans will go to waste. Then, everyone will be in danger.

117
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:11,520
Thus, you must take my parents to a safe place.

118
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:13,210
Please.

119
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,030
Yes.

120
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:24,000
 Will you die as the king's subject 

121
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,470
 or will you live as the father of a daughter? 

122
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,640
 Then, how about Chae Gyeong? 

123
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:33,140
 Are you going to abandon your daughter? 

124
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,170
Who are you people?

125
00:10:44,170 --> 00:10:46,310
The Deputy Commander sent us.

126
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:49,290
He asked us to keep the First Vice Premier safe.

127
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:55,180
The Deputy Commander wants me to be protected?

128
00:10:55,180 --> 00:10:57,640
What's happening here?

129
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:02,500
A revolt has happened at last.

130
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:19,270
Have you been very bored all this time?

131
00:11:26,450 --> 00:11:29,330
Why are you constantly looking back?

132
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,680
It's nothing, Your Majesty.

133
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:33,510
Tell me.

134
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:40,480
People that are armed are following behind me and I'm just not used to that.

135
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,580
I feel like they are going to kill me any minute.

136
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:50,620
Maybe it's because I still have a memory of suffering through something so difficult.

137
00:12:10,740 --> 00:12:12,970
The rebels have invaded.

138
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,570
The Snail Brides have invaded.

139
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:16,700
We should hurry and get away from here.

140
00:12:16,700 --> 00:12:19,240
Hurry up.

141
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:37,210
 Today, your world will end, Sire. 

142
00:12:45,380 --> 00:12:47,680
Why are you crying?

143
00:12:51,620 --> 00:12:54,500
I thought of my family.

144
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:56,220
Family?

145
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:01,430
I guess you must miss the First Vice Premier and his wife.

146
00:13:01,430 --> 00:13:03,330
No, Sire.

147
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,590
Then what?

148
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,510
No, you do not need to answer me.

149
00:13:11,770 --> 00:13:14,740
I thought of the Warrior.

150
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:20,240
In the past, he fought with his younger brother,

151
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,840
which made him so upset that he cooled himself off by seeking cold water.

152
00:13:23,840 --> 00:13:25,530
 Who is it? 

153
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:29,410
That was the person I thought about.

154
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:35,770
A young girl said it was too difficult for her to go alone

155
00:13:36,410 --> 00:13:39,710
so he did a favor for her when she asked.

156
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:44,670
At the end of the day, he couldn't say no and went to the tavern with the girl.

157
00:13:44,670 --> 00:13:47,260
That's the person I was thinking of.

158
00:13:48,550 --> 00:13:53,790
He said, "Why didn't you run away by yourself?", "How could you have been so foolish?"

159
00:13:55,450 --> 00:13:57,760
 Why aren't you waking up? Warrior! 

160
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:00,460
He worried about the girl who was laying down in the medicine room.

161
00:14:00,460 --> 00:14:03,080
 He isn't even the Jade Emperor for crying out loud. 

162
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:06,680
He said that he would grant her a wish if he met her again.

163
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,660
I thought of that person who was really friendly and warmhearted.

164
00:14:12,610 --> 00:14:17,260
A lonely man who performed a ceremony for his dead mother who died alone.

165
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:21,510
A man who cried because of guilt over what happened to his younger brother.

166
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,310
I was recalling a man who lifted me up in the rain.

167
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,570
Every time I met with him, at every hour of the day

168
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:35,700
he was a man who was warm and kind, at least to me.

169
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:44,380
I was recollecting the memory of a man who was just lonely and in pain, that's all.

170
00:14:46,070 --> 00:14:49,630
I cried because I really miss that person right now.

171
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:51,840
He must have died already.

172
00:14:52,500 --> 00:14:57,440
He must have disappeared. He's gone, I say.

173
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,600
Yes, Sire.

174
00:15:01,080 --> 00:15:03,670
That's why I cried.

175
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:06,750
Because I know that I won't be able to see him ever again.

176
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,800
Why did you kill him, Sire?

177
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:14,810
You could've saved him, Sire. You could've protected him!

178
00:15:14,810 --> 00:15:16,610
You could've done that for him

179
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:21,270
and also for his younger brother, friends and family.

180
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,690
But you didn't do any of that, Your Majesty.

181
00:15:25,690 --> 00:15:27,860
You, Sire...

182
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:30,790
You, Sire, have enough power to put fate in its rightful place and fix it.

183
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:33,970
And you also have the power to organize and find the right opportunity.

184
00:15:33,970 --> 00:15:35,900
But you didn't do anything.

185
00:15:35,900 --> 00:15:42,610
You can't even control your own heart so why are you trying to control other people's lives?

186
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:54,630
You're trying too hard, my dear. Trying too hard, I say.

187
00:15:54,630 --> 00:15:57,860
You are intentionally trying to provoke me

188
00:15:57,860 --> 00:16:00,610
and buying time...

189
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:04,240
What is the cause?

190
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,170
Why are you saying that all of a sudden, Sire?

191
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:10,010
Your Majesty!

192
00:16:10,010 --> 00:16:13,870
We're in big trouble. They say that rebels have barged in through the gate and are advancing further in.

193
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:15,320
What do you mean by rebel soldiers?

194
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:19,550
People that were exiled into the provinces and the countryside were the ones who raised the military.

195
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:25,170
Was it because of this?

196
00:16:25,170 --> 00:16:30,400
Were you holding me hostage until Yeok returns?

197
00:16:37,250 --> 00:16:39,640
Didn't I already warn you?!

198
00:16:39,640 --> 00:16:43,780
I can kill you at any time. I will have you even if it means I have to kill you!

199
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:46,590
There must not be anything that a King cannot possess.

200
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,310
It would be better if we die together.

201
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,980
I am guilty for daring to accept your heart.

202
00:16:53,980 --> 00:16:55,740
You are guilty for

203
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:59,310
abandoning Joseon.

204
00:16:59,310 --> 00:17:02,070
We both will probably die

205
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:06,080
but a lot of people will be able to survive due to that.

206
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:12,650
There will be war soon. The rebel soldiers are coming up towards the capital from the provinces.

207
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:17,690
And also the opposing groups in the palace to take your throne are surrounding the whole palace.

208
00:17:17,690 --> 00:17:22,310
There are no troops to protect you here in the palace.

209
00:17:22,310 --> 00:17:23,590
What did you say?

210
00:17:23,590 --> 00:17:27,070
Everyone will abandon you and run away.

211
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,720
You have lost the public sentiment and the whole country has lost faith in you as well.

212
00:17:32,350 --> 00:17:36,340
You also lost the support of the governing officials as well.

213
00:17:40,050 --> 00:17:41,810
I'm going to kill you.

214
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:43,800
I should've killed you.

215
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:47,120
If I can't have you, I should just kill you and have my way with you!

216
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,110
That's what I should've done!

217
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,110
Your Majesty.

218
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:27,010
These are the first group of people that should be killed once the traitor's rebel troops arrive.

219
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:31,080
What do you mean rebels? You chopped off both of Yeok's hands and feet

220
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,310
but you are still suspicious of him?!

221
00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:38,020
You don't think I know that Yeok is perfectly fine?!

222
00:18:38,020 --> 00:18:43,260
As if that's not enough, he is on his way over here with his rebel troops?

223
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:48,850
What do you mean by rebel troops?

224
00:18:48,850 --> 00:18:52,080
What do you mean by all this?!

225
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,010
It's because Chae Gyeong is helping with all this.

226
00:18:57,550 --> 00:19:05,470
Would there be any way that Chae Gyeong would dare to betray me and help somebody else other than Yeok?

227
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:14,430
- Royal Mother!  
 - I command you to watch this room exclusively!

228
00:19:14,430 --> 00:19:18,240
There can't be anybody coming in and out of this room! Never!

229
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,540
Yes, Sire!

230
00:19:25,890 --> 00:19:28,800
Royal Mother, are you all right?

231
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:36,400
I command and appoint 1,000 men to Minister of Defense Ryu Ja Gwang.

232
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:39,100
Capture every single one who is part of this rebellious act and get rid of them.

233
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,320
I will uphold your command!

234
00:19:41,320 --> 00:19:45,870
If anyone is jumping into the bandwagon with this rebellious group,

235
00:19:45,870 --> 00:19:50,700
it doesn't matter what positions they have,  just grab them and kill them all. Do you understand?

236
00:19:51,210 --> 00:19:54,740
From now on make sure that not even an ant can pass through here!

237
00:19:54,740 --> 00:19:56,210
Yes, Sir!

238
00:19:56,210 --> 00:19:59,680
Get all of the troops and gather them in front of the gate!

239
00:19:59,680 --> 00:20:03,390
We will be advancing straight to the gate of the fortress as soon as everyone is summoned!

240
00:20:03,390 --> 00:20:05,630
Yes, my Lord!

241
00:20:12,770 --> 00:20:14,850
Long time no see,

242
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,450
Minister of Defense.

243
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:29,780
Your Highness the Grand Prince.

244
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:42,230
If you lead the troops outside of here, then you will

245
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:45,560
have to fight back and forth against the rebel soldiers stationed outside of the fortress

246
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:52,410
who have joined forces with the Capital Defense troops  surrounding the palace.

247
00:20:54,390 --> 00:20:57,250
The chances of winning are extremely low.

248
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:00,620
If you don't go out there despite all this,

249
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:05,810
then you would be guilty for going against the royal command and you would lose your head for that.

250
00:21:07,450 --> 00:21:10,310
Would you rather die in the hands of the rebel soldiers?

251
00:21:10,310 --> 00:21:13,470
Or would you rather die in the hands of the King?

252
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:21,990
Or will you help me and become the most meritorious contributor to this rebellion?

253
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:28,080
Your Majesty. I will be utterly loyal.

254
00:21:31,410 --> 00:21:33,130
Yeok.

255
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:36,790
Yeok.

256
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:39,720
It's alright, Royal Mother.

257
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:42,050
Don't worry.

258
00:21:44,850 --> 00:21:46,340
What is going on?

259
00:21:46,340 --> 00:21:48,250
Let him be.

260
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,640
He's on our side.

261
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,950
Pardon?

262
00:21:51,950 --> 00:21:57,120
Yeok has already made him to be on our side.

263
00:21:57,120 --> 00:21:58,690
What is going on?

264
00:21:58,690 --> 00:22:01,480
His Majesty has moved the troops.

265
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:04,870
To stop the rebel forces stationed at the entrance of the capital.

266
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:08,080
Then, is it going according to the Grand Prince's plan?

267
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:11,640
Yes. Once all the Defense Ministry's troops leave the palace,

268
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:16,780
our troops will enter the palace and stop the king's guards.

269
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:20,520
Please endure a little longer, Your Highness.

270
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:23,180
It won't be long.

271
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:54,920
All command. Shoot.

272
00:22:56,460 --> 00:22:58,440
Shoot.

273
00:23:07,380 --> 00:23:11,310
They are fleeing very fast.

274
00:23:11,310 --> 00:23:13,650
We shouldn't relax yet.

275
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:25,470
 Orabeoni, now it's up to you. 

276
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:29,210
Keep in mind. The gate must stay shut.

277
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,680
Yes.

278
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:39,700
Those rebel forces didn't even leave any proper weapon behind when they were fleeing.

279
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:45,130
There were only lots of farm tools left behind such as sickles, rakes, and hoes.

280
00:23:45,130 --> 00:23:48,200
Grand Prince Jin Seong must also have felt really rushed.

281
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:52,580
Seeing how he brought as his troops some low-lifes who only know how to farm.

282
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:57,080
How pitiful.

283
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,980
Still, you should guard properly.

284
00:24:00,980 --> 00:24:04,700
The Minister of Defense stationed troops

285
00:24:04,700 --> 00:24:07,760
at every gate into the capital.

286
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,140
Capital Defense troops, along with the Minister Seong, will guard the palace gate,

287
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,780
the Snail Brides disguised as the Defense Ministry's troops, will follow me into the Grand Palace.

288
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:24,910
Yes.

289
00:24:24,910 --> 00:24:29,020
I will take the remaining troops to block the insects.

290
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,210
We must eliminate those closest to the king to prevent commotion.

291
00:24:32,210 --> 00:24:33,880
I understand.

292
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:37,800
Let's move now.

293
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,400
Yes.

294
00:24:45,860 --> 00:24:47,970
This is the Minister of Defense. Make way.

295
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:49,580
Yes.

296
00:24:59,050 --> 00:25:02,960
- Halt! 
 - I am the Minister of Defense Ryu Ja Gwang.

297
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,700
Make way!

298
00:25:04,700 --> 00:25:06,220
You cannot go any further.

299
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,680
I have an urgent report for the king.

300
00:25:08,680 --> 00:25:10,250
Then

301
00:25:12,020 --> 00:25:14,190
leave the troops here.

302
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:17,780
Only you will come with me.

303
00:25:17,780 --> 00:25:21,280
Protect this place with the Royal Guards.

304
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,680
Yes.

305
00:25:47,510 --> 00:25:52,300
Oh my, Minister Ryu. You're working hard.

306
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:54,540
It's nothing.

307
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,030
I have entered the palace since there is something I must personally report to the king.

308
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,280
Oh, yes.

309
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:05,470
The first rule of Sun Tzu's The Art of War is to win without a battle,

310
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:09,270
and you have made that happen today.

311
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:12,450
This is called capturing the city without any blood loss...

312
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:16,790
Or rather, shall I call it winning the war without any blood loss?

313
00:26:18,270 --> 00:26:22,000
We still need to wait and see. Then.

314
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,880
Oh, yes.

315
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:38,750
Yes. You have won without shedding any blood.

316
00:26:38,750 --> 00:26:45,270
Yes, Your Majesty. They were low-lifes that weren't worth fighting.

317
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:47,020
How about Yeok?

318
00:26:49,070 --> 00:26:51,820
Did Yeok show up?

319
00:26:51,820 --> 00:26:55,710
Grand Prince Jin Seong wasn't present.

320
00:26:56,350 --> 00:27:02,830
Really? Yeok must also have known they had no chance of winning.

321
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:05,850
You must capture Yeok.

322
00:27:05,850 --> 00:27:09,010
As long as we capture Yeok who is the root of the treason,

323
00:27:09,010 --> 00:27:13,060
all the traitors will scatter.

324
00:27:17,680 --> 00:27:20,380
Do you really think so?

325
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:25,030
They say that the heavens appoint the king.

326
00:27:26,820 --> 00:27:30,910
The heart of the heavens is the same as the heart of the people.

327
00:27:30,910 --> 00:27:33,640
Even if you kill Grand Prince Jin Seong,

328
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:37,110
if the heavens don't acknowledge the king, will the people,

329
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:42,590
and the heavens  forgive the king?

330
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,630
What did you say?

331
00:27:55,140 --> 00:28:01,100
Who are you? Daring to say such nonsense in the royal presence?

332
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,870
How, how can you be?

333
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:31,020
Now I must put everything back to its rightful place.

334
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,380
Did you increase the troops?

335
00:28:43,380 --> 00:28:48,910
No, they are the troops of the Defense Ministry that the Minister of Defense brought with him.

336
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:51,690
Troops of the Defense Ministry—

337
00:28:53,130 --> 00:28:56,450
- That is so. Work hard.
- Yes.

338
00:29:06,550 --> 00:29:11,190
Lord, you said the troops of the Defense Ministry are all stationed by the gate.

339
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:13,180
It's capturing the city without any blood loss.

340
00:29:13,180 --> 00:29:18,870
They have kept the Defense Ministry's troops outside the capital, and entered with the rebel forces.

341
00:29:20,210 --> 00:29:22,000
You are saying...

342
00:29:22,970 --> 00:29:27,210
It seems as though Ryu Ja Gwang has betrayed us.

343
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,560
It's too late.

344
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,280
With the troops inside the palace, we can't stop them.

345
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,480
His Majesty is also already ...

346
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:53,090
Lord, go seek what you serve.

347
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:58,010
I will seek the person that I serve.

348
00:30:09,550 --> 00:30:12,860
Since you have given me a chance,

349
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:15,950
I will give you a chance as well.

350
00:30:15,950 --> 00:30:18,510
What did you say?

351
00:30:18,510 --> 00:30:22,010
This is the last chance given to us brothers.

352
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,510
What's happened?

353
00:30:34,510 --> 00:30:36,000
What is it?

354
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:40,250
What's going on? What are you doing?

355
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:43,910
What are you doing?

356
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:46,510
 Hurry, Grand Prince. 

357
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:09,050
The Minister of Defense and the Grand Prince have just entered the council hall.

358
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,850
The council hall?

359
00:31:10,850 --> 00:31:14,710
Now, he will be facing his last obstacle.

360
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,370
 Why were you born? 

361
00:31:36,370 --> 00:31:38,320
 I am sorry for being born.   

362
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:43,400
 However, as long as I was born, I must fulfill my duty and responsibility.   

363
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:45,970
 Thus, just leave. 

364
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:50,780
 I guess this fight will only end if one of us dies.   

365
00:31:51,500 --> 00:31:54,110
Grand Prince! Your Majesty!

366
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,270
What?

367
00:32:04,270 --> 00:32:08,160
 While the two brothers prepared for their final time, 

368
00:32:08,160 --> 00:32:10,900
 the troops led by the high ministers wishing to depose the king, 

369
00:32:10,900 --> 00:32:15,490
 and the king's direct protection command, the inner forbidden guards, were on standby with their arrows drawn on bows. 

370
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:24,250
 Inside and outside the palace, it was overflowing with those who fled seeking to live. 

371
00:32:43,150 --> 00:32:44,900
Grand Prince!

372
00:32:46,650 --> 00:32:48,580
Hurry and slash me.

373
00:32:48,580 --> 00:32:51,820
Isn't this the moment you so desperately waited for?

374
00:32:53,710 --> 00:32:55,690
Grand Prince, you must not.

375
00:32:55,690 --> 00:32:57,650
What are you waiting for?

376
00:32:57,650 --> 00:33:02,060
Did you come all the way here without even the nerve to kill me?

377
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:20,770
Grand Prince.

378
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:50,060
Great. This is great.

379
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:56,600
Finally, Yeok, you became king.

380
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,650
Finally, you became king.

381
00:34:02,450 --> 00:34:07,910
Thanks to that, my revenge is complete.

382
00:34:16,140 --> 00:34:20,970
When you abandoned the royal throne

383
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,840
and held Chae Gyeong's hand

384
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:27,510
to seek for happiness. Since that moment,

385
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,710
I've plotted my revenge upon you.

386
00:34:31,710 --> 00:34:34,970
How could I torment you more thoroughly?

387
00:34:34,970 --> 00:34:38,790
I agonized and agonized over it.

388
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:41,850
And you got merely this as your answer?

389
00:34:41,850 --> 00:34:43,690
Like this...

390
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,140
to come to your downfall so bitterly?

391
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:56,370
No. It was to make you King.

392
00:34:56,370 --> 00:35:02,400
Make you king, and the pain I've endured living as King,

393
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:04,860
I cast off all to you.

394
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:10,140
I'll let you experience it exactly the same. It was my resolution.

395
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:18,170
Yeok. My younger brother.

396
00:35:20,110 --> 00:35:23,810
Just what agony awaits you in this path.

397
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:26,400
Aren't you curious about it?

398
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:27,930
Hyungnim.

399
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:31,310
You may look forward to it.

400
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:20,800
Is it all finished now?

401
00:36:20,800 --> 00:36:25,330
Yes. It's all finished now.

402
00:36:26,910 --> 00:36:32,870
Now, can we be happy?

403
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:39,950
Of course. Now we...

404
00:36:42,190 --> 00:36:44,410
can be happy.

405
00:37:03,960 --> 00:37:05,750
Laugh!

406
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:09,140
If you will not cry for me, it would be better to laugh!

407
00:37:09,140 --> 00:37:12,120
Laugh to your content!

408
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:30,710
Wife, I'm sorry.

409
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,410
Even if I try to stop you,

410
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:44,470
you will still go, right?

411
00:37:45,550 --> 00:37:50,820
I've told His Majesty I'd be his father.

412
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,720
That I'd be his family for him.

413
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,630
But I failed to keep that promise.

414
00:37:57,640 --> 00:38:01,740
Probably, this is the last chance

415
00:38:01,740 --> 00:38:04,350
I can keep that promise.

416
00:38:09,170 --> 00:38:11,180
I understand.

417
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:18,090
I will escort you on your path.

418
00:38:18,700 --> 00:38:21,130
Since it may be a long path,

419
00:38:21,130 --> 00:38:26,870
how could I send you away by yourself?

420
00:38:26,870 --> 00:38:29,330
Please wait a moment.

421
00:38:35,850 --> 00:38:40,140
It's been so long since you've worn it, it's wrinkled.

422
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:42,150
I can iron it quickly.

423
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:45,580
 Robe worn by higher ranking officials 

424
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:52,410
This time, I am not going as His Majesty's subject.

425
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:58,180
I am going as His Majesty's family.

426
00:38:58,730 --> 00:39:03,940
Can you not wait even for one moment?

427
00:39:05,540 --> 00:39:08,500
What about our Chae Gyeong, Your Excellency?

428
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,650
Our Chae Gyeong will be alright then, right, Your Excellency?

429
00:39:19,460 --> 00:39:21,840
It's all my fault.

430
00:39:23,830 --> 00:39:25,970
I'm sorry, Wife.

431
00:39:26,670 --> 00:39:28,560
I'm sorry, Wife.

432
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:32,200
Your Excellency.

433
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:48,700
Back away.

434
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:51,600
The order is to block you if you move.

435
00:39:56,830 --> 00:40:00,180
Open the door!

436
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:06,630
Chief Royal Secretary.

437
00:40:16,810 --> 00:40:19,910
So you've come, at last.

438
00:40:19,910 --> 00:40:23,460
That's quite tremendous.

439
00:40:23,460 --> 00:40:29,400
We battled with our lives wagered so the loser should hand over his life, right?

440
00:40:31,140 --> 00:40:35,590
How is it that the First Vice Premier and Deputy Commander are both so clogged up?

441
00:40:35,590 --> 00:40:42,320
I always leave open a clear way to spare my life.

442
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:47,660
It seems there isn't a way for you to leave here alive.

443
00:40:49,390 --> 00:40:55,820
Deputy Commander, you will come to ask me to open that path for you.

444
00:41:01,770 --> 00:41:09,010
If His Majesty finds out it was you who led the Snail Brides,

445
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,680
will he leave you alone?

446
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,820
I've shown clemency and saved your life once.

447
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:27,090
Now it's your turn to do the same, it seems.

448
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:41,030
Just because a new era has opened, we can't fill everything with only the new.

449
00:41:41,030 --> 00:41:46,780
I shall put effort towards you and the new king in the future.

450
00:41:48,910 --> 00:41:54,600
What do we do, Deputy Commander? Give us your order.

451
00:41:57,910 --> 00:42:01,880
What reason would there be to kill me for certain?

452
00:42:02,690 --> 00:42:06,190
I am someone who could come to be much help.

453
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:12,930
Those offerings are my first gift to Your Excellency.

454
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,710
Let him go.

455
00:42:15,800 --> 00:42:17,670
Deputy Commander.

456
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:25,090
Deputy Commander!

457
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:46,200
Aren't you going on the wrong path?

458
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:48,310
It's not here but...

459
00:42:48,310 --> 00:42:50,910
This is the right path, Your Excellency.

460
00:43:00,500 --> 00:43:05,230
You bastard, what are you doing?

461
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:11,010
It's an honor I could escort Your Excellency on the final path.

462
00:43:11,780 --> 00:43:13,880
What?

463
00:43:18,410 --> 00:43:20,540
You bastard.

464
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:23,880
Scum.

465
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:46,340
Your family will be spared as promised.

466
00:43:46,340 --> 00:43:52,510
And as promised, I will allow you to live as a villager in a nameless mountain village.

467
00:43:54,340 --> 00:43:56,450
 Slave deed 

468
00:44:02,720 --> 00:44:04,600
Thank you.

469
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,680
And you need to pay the rest of what you owe too.

470
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:22,280
Though your body is crippled,

471
00:44:22,280 --> 00:44:26,100
you will finally live as a human now.

472
00:44:49,220 --> 00:44:51,020
Move aside.

473
00:44:51,020 --> 00:44:56,750
Even if I am to be hauled away,  I should at least bid farewell to my king.

474
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:14,640
Nok Su is here.

475
00:45:33,040 --> 00:45:35,270
Your Majesty.

476
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:38,370
Flee even if it's now.

477
00:45:38,370 --> 00:45:43,490
You need to keep your life in order to do whatever it is.

478
00:45:44,290 --> 00:45:49,900
What could your consort do without her king?

479
00:45:52,410 --> 00:45:57,730
Does a flower bloom for long?

480
00:45:58,580 --> 00:46:04,980
A flower blooms beautifully for one short season,

481
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:07,850
and withers.

482
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:13,950
Your consort, in this lifetime,

483
00:46:14,900 --> 00:46:18,490
I came and lived as Your Majesty's flower before leaving.

484
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:22,170
That is enough to satisfy me.

485
00:46:44,020 --> 00:46:46,790
With Your Majesty's hand,

486
00:46:48,920 --> 00:46:51,630
please kill me.

487
00:48:28,470 --> 00:48:32,430
 Because I do not know the reason for this dreary feeling, 

488
00:48:32,430 --> 00:48:36,360
 Because I do not know with what state of mind I should gaze upon you, 

489
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:40,210
 it is better to close my eyes. 

490
00:48:40,940 --> 00:48:47,640
 Clearly it went as I willed. Why is it that I feel so dreary? 

491
00:49:05,280 --> 00:49:08,590
We greet Your Highness, the Queen Dowager.

492
00:49:15,650 --> 00:49:20,580
Overnight, a grand event happened and I was also very agitated.

493
00:49:20,580 --> 00:49:25,320
However it settled quite well and it was indeed with Heaven's help.

494
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:28,440
It is so, Your Highness the Queen Dowager.

495
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:32,750
Hence your subjects have come here to ask for your permission.

496
00:49:32,750 --> 00:49:36,380
We recommend crowning Grand Prince Jin Seong as the new king.

497
00:49:36,380 --> 00:49:39,380
May you grant us your permission.

498
00:49:39,380 --> 00:49:45,080
I do not know if Grand Prince Jin Seong could really shoulder such a grand and heavy burden.

499
00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,910
We deem him fully capable of doing very well.

500
00:49:47,910 --> 00:49:51,810
Yes, it is thanks to Grand Prince's quick action

501
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:55,520
that we could capture the deposed king without much resistance.

502
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:59,190
We also blocked the rebellion army and an internal war among the standing army.

503
00:49:59,190 --> 00:50:03,430
He is the king we have waited for.

504
00:50:05,690 --> 00:50:08,310
Then do so.

505
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:17,350
Royal Father. Royal Mother.

506
00:50:17,350 --> 00:50:19,580
Crown Prince.

507
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,340
Royal Grandmother.

508
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:43,670
The king has lost his virtues on the upper end.

509
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:46,200
And the common people are toiling in misery.

510
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,140
With our state in crisis, we have worried in wake and sleep.

511
00:50:50,140 --> 00:50:55,030
Hence we crown Grand Prince Jin Seong as our king, overseer of our state.

512
00:50:55,030 --> 00:50:59,850
All military and scholarly officials of the court, follow suit.

513
00:51:00,690 --> 00:51:06,080
Henceforth deposed king, Lee Yoong, shall be demoted as Prince and exiled to Gwanghwa Gyodong.

514
00:51:06,080 --> 00:51:09,590
Deposed queen of Sin clan shall move to reside in Jeongcheong Palace.

515
00:51:09,590 --> 00:51:14,550
Deposed crown prince Lee Hwang to Jeongseon. Grand Prince Changnyeong to Suahn.

516
00:51:14,550 --> 00:51:19,260
Prince Yangpyeong Lee Yi  will be exiled to Jaechan.

517
00:51:29,130 --> 00:51:33,710
 Chae Gyeong, are you alright?  

518
00:51:33,710 --> 00:51:36,450
 Please look at me. 

519
00:51:51,430 --> 00:51:55,140
 We greet Your Highness, the Queen. 

520
00:52:11,250 --> 00:52:14,260
Your Highness the Queen. Your Highness the Queen.

521
00:52:17,570 --> 00:52:19,570
Please forgive me.

522
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:26,120
First Vice Premier and Premier Madam passed away.

523
00:52:38,820 --> 00:52:39,980
 Step aside. 

524
00:52:39,980 --> 00:52:42,940
 Our order was to stop you if you moved. 

525
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:46,990
 Only His Majesty can cast orders on me. 

526
00:52:46,990 --> 00:52:49,190
 Step aside. 

527
00:52:49,190 --> 00:52:52,290
 Your Excellency! 

528
00:52:52,290 --> 00:52:56,500
 Your Excellency. Your Excellency! 

529
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:11,980
 Wife, upon our death, let us be one and protect Chae Gyeong only.  

530
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:20,770
 For failing to live completely as a father and for failing to die as a royal subject, I'm sorry.   

531
00:53:28,220 --> 00:53:31,950
Father. Father!

532
00:53:36,920 --> 00:53:38,840
Father. Fa—

533
00:53:43,950 --> 00:53:48,160
Mom. Mother. Mother.

534
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:55,160
Mother.

535
00:53:56,300 --> 00:54:00,860
The deposed king has been moved to the Eastern Palace, so now Your Highness the Grand Prince...

536
00:54:00,860 --> 00:54:05,420
I mean, Your Majesty should be seated in the Grand Palace.

537
00:54:05,420 --> 00:54:10,550
Your coronation will take place soon, so you must make preparations.

538
00:54:10,550 --> 00:54:13,100
I understand.

539
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:17,130
Royal Mother, is your body well?

540
00:54:17,130 --> 00:54:22,310
I'm fine. Today, I am all recovered.

541
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:28,580
However, why is your expression like this?

542
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:37,210
I made it through a big crisis, but I do not feel happy.

543
00:54:37,210 --> 00:54:39,480
I have lost too much.

544
00:54:39,480 --> 00:54:44,020
And I gravely fear what is to be lost in the future.

545
00:54:44,020 --> 00:54:50,040
You have thus far lived being always chased by death and with exorbitant apprehension.

546
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:55,200
So you must have forgotten how to enjoy happiness.

547
00:54:55,200 --> 00:54:59,120
Now, there will only be happiness.

548
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:05,250
Then, I shall go to my wife.

549
00:55:05,250 --> 00:55:10,610
Yes. She's contributed greatly to the capturing the deposed king, I hear.

550
00:55:32,250 --> 00:55:33,860
What?

551
00:55:36,370 --> 00:55:38,340
What happened?

552
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:52,780
Mother. It's my first time coming home in a long time, but will you only sleep like this?

553
00:55:52,780 --> 00:56:01,790
You should cook me food, nag me, and slap my back.

554
00:56:03,110 --> 00:56:07,490
Mother. Mother.

555
00:56:08,800 --> 00:56:11,080
Mother.

556
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:22,260
Father.

557
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:26,300
Father, I'm sorry I got mad at you.

558
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:31,180
Father, I knew very well where you stood but I was just resentful.

559
00:56:31,180 --> 00:56:35,730
Father. You don't have to be a wonderful father.

560
00:56:35,730 --> 00:56:41,120
You don't need to be an extraordinary subject or anything of that sort. So please.

561
00:56:41,120 --> 00:56:44,700
Please just be alive.

562
00:56:44,700 --> 00:56:47,570
Father, please.

563
00:57:10,510 --> 00:57:12,460
Father-in-law!

564
00:57:13,220 --> 00:57:14,980
I...

565
00:57:29,720 --> 00:57:34,470
How... why...

566
00:57:45,340 --> 00:57:49,960
Chae Gyeong! Chae Gyeong, wake up!

567
00:58:25,030 --> 00:58:31,680
 Live only as my son-in-law. Only as Chae Gyeong's husband. Only as the King's younger brother.  

568
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,370
 After protecting his lord as long as he can, 

569
00:58:35,370 --> 00:58:39,910
 if he still doesn't succeed, he will die fighting for his king. 

570
00:58:39,910 --> 00:58:42,580
 This is the fate of a subject. 

571
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:46,600
Why did you make such a foolish choice?

572
00:58:48,110 --> 00:58:49,930
Why?

573
00:58:51,900 --> 00:58:54,480
Why!

574
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,580
My lady.

575
00:59:10,780 --> 00:59:12,500
My lady.

576
00:59:14,060 --> 00:59:17,260
Nanny. You were alive!

577
00:59:17,260 --> 00:59:19,590
Are you safe? You're not injured anywhere?

578
00:59:19,590 --> 00:59:21,270
Yes, my lady.

579
00:59:21,270 --> 00:59:24,100
You're really alive, right? You're really alright, right?

580
00:59:24,100 --> 00:59:27,040
Yes, I'm alive.

581
00:59:28,130 --> 00:59:32,370
Nanny, I think I had a nightmare.

582
00:59:32,370 --> 00:59:39,980
Do you know what I saw? What I saw was my mother and father.

583
00:59:40,820 --> 00:59:46,570
But that's not possible, right? It's a nightmare, right?

584
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:50,700
Nanny. Let's go see my parents. Now. Quickly.

585
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:54,060
My lady. My lady.

586
01:00:01,330 --> 01:00:03,640
My lady.

587
01:00:06,800 --> 01:00:09,510
My lady.

588
01:00:10,990 --> 01:00:14,000
What do you mean?

589
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:17,150
You don't need to worry about the Lady.

590
01:00:17,150 --> 01:00:22,360
She will likely come down from that seat on her own.

591
01:00:29,900 --> 01:00:31,800
Nanny.

592
01:00:32,670 --> 01:00:36,270
Yes. I'm right here.

593
01:00:36,270 --> 01:00:39,500
Can you bring me a dressing stand?

594
01:00:39,500 --> 01:00:41,570
What?

595
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,210
Yes.

596
01:00:58,810 --> 01:01:00,160
Look here.

597
01:01:00,160 --> 01:01:02,540
Yes, Your Highness.

598
01:01:06,150 --> 01:01:13,490
I plan to go see His Majesty, but I can't go looking like this.

599
01:01:13,490 --> 01:01:16,260
I will alert them to prepare.

600
01:01:16,260 --> 01:01:19,840
Let them know to put extra care into it.

601
01:01:21,140 --> 01:01:28,160


602
01:01:36,700 --> 01:01:38,710
Chae Gyeong.

603
01:02:11,750 --> 01:02:16,430
This is where the heart is. That way I'll die.

604
01:02:21,940 --> 01:02:22,800
♫   I want to hold you, the one whose brilliance chills my heart   ♫
