1
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:46,530
 This is the king's daily activity copied in secret from the records department. 

2
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,590
 The late king's will was left in a secret order. 

3
00:00:51,590 --> 00:00:53,490
 We've finally found him, Your Majesty. 

4
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:59,700
 The scribe who worked the night shift at the palace during the final moments of the late king. 

5
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:03,200
 T.N. Scribes followed the king 24/7 recording his every move. 

6
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:06,680
 Is it because you're scared or because of the smell? 

7
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,390
 Go inside quickly and deal with nature's call! 

8
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:17,330
 He has been living in Dongjeokjeon village, in the outskirts of Dongdaemun, hiding his identity. 

9
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:21,520
 The Queen Dowager's movements are quite strange. 

10
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:28,390
 Her Highness the Queen Dowager left the palace with His Highness the Grand Prince Jin Seong. 

11
00:01:28,390 --> 00:01:32,660
  The more she reveals about herself, the more interesting she becomes. 

12
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:37,530
 What if the Queen Dowager is also aware of the secret order? 

13
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:42,620
 What if, like us, she's attempting to find the scribe to secure the secret order? 

14
00:01:42,620 --> 00:01:44,790
 So we must find it first!  

15
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:48,960
 We need to find it as quickly as possible and destroy it. 

16
00:01:57,760 --> 00:02:00,600
Oh, that is...

17
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,210
I've thought about this quite a bit.

18
00:02:05,020 --> 00:02:09,980
No matter how much I think, I must marry you, Your Highness.

19
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:14,430
Rather than school principal's nephew twice removed whom I have never even met,

20
00:02:14,430 --> 00:02:18,120
I have seen you and have become friends with you.

21
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:21,030
So it's better to marry you.

22
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,440
For you too, for many reasons, I think it would be better  to marry me.

23
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,510
Young Lady, Grand Prince.

24
00:02:35,510 --> 00:02:37,430
Here, we are here.

25
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,360
Why aren't you answering me?

26
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,210
Am... Am I crazy?

27
00:02:54,770 --> 00:02:57,380
 Become Chief Royal Secretary Sin Soo Geun's son-in-law. 

28
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,690
 Then, I will keep you alive. 

29
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,790
Whatever! I don't want it either.

30
00:03:07,790 --> 00:03:13,690
If he's a scumbag, it's better that he act like one so I will lose all interest in him,

31
00:03:13,690 --> 00:03:18,470
or be an intelligent and dashing grand prince, so that I can only dream about him.

32
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:22,360
He's just a half and half young master who's arrogant too.

33
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:29,040
 Queen for Seven Days 

34
00:03:40,730 --> 00:03:41,900
 Episode 3 

35
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:45,890
God of heaven and earth, god of the dragon.

36
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:49,250
Please listen to the prayer of the Joseon people.

37
00:03:49,250 --> 00:03:52,790
Continued drought this year has dried up the crops,

38
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:58,950
it's difficult for people to keep their livelihood. Ditches are filled with corpses,

39
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:05,810
Since I am lacking, even though I have faults and committed sins,

40
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:12,960
No ruler has ever personally given a prayer ceremony for rain.

41
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:19,400
It's a noble intention, helping to achieve the  people's wishes through rituals.

42
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,890
However, the rain ceremony for crops needs to go through a 12-step process,

43
00:04:23,890 --> 00:04:27,430
in each of the renowned mountains, the large rivers, the royal ancestral shrine at Jongmyo,

44
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:31,340
as well as offering sacrifices to the dragon gods.

45
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:35,930
Ministers are supposed to be deployed as the sacrificial priests.

46
00:04:35,930 --> 00:04:42,990
Are your trying to say it's against the code for His Majesty to personally carry out the ministers' duties?

47
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:47,500
I am saying His Majesty alone can not carry out everything.

48
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:54,400
He's not doing it alone. He's trying to personally do it out of earnest good intentions.

49
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:56,600
That's him being obsessive and compulsive.

50
00:04:56,600 --> 00:05:02,290
He needs to get his own way even with natural phenomena in order to be satisfied.

51
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:06,390
Please give rain in abundance.

52
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:08,880
It's good if it works out.

53
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,350
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

54
00:05:24,350 --> 00:05:26,810
Your Majesty, please take care of your body.

55
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:31,410
Your Majesty!

56
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:38,740
 My Royal Father, I don't know about the Great Jade Emperor (the god of heaven) or the Dragon King God (the sea god) .

57
00:05:38,740 --> 00:05:43,510
 I have never acquainted myself with them, 

58
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,120
 nor have I relied on them. 

59
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:51,520
 However, Royal Father, are you watching? 

60
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,910
 My devotion and prayer are sincere. 

61
00:05:54,910 --> 00:06:00,300
 Your son earnestly prays for rain. 

62
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:08,420
They think salamanders bring forth wind and rain, so—

63
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:13,160
Oh yes. What did you do with my salamander water holder?

64
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:19,900
You said you meant to give it to the King anyway. It's better this way.

65
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:22,390
You were able to save money, and the water pot was given to your intended person.

66
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:26,330
Wow. I am so thankful.

67
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:29,720
Out of everything, why did you buy a salamander-shaped water holder?

68
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,570
- A salamander is a dragon that lives in a ditch— 
 - A salamander is a dragon that lives in a ditch—

69
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,780
 "A dragon emerging from a small stream" describes a great man with humble beginnings. 

70
00:06:35,780 --> 00:06:38,390
Anyway, they say it's a dragon.

71
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:42,640
A dragon is the symbol of the king, so of course I thought it matches the king best.

72
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:46,070
Ah, "the dragon that lives in a ditch."

73
00:06:46,070 --> 00:06:47,600
How childish!

74
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,810
- What's childish? 
 - What's childish?

75
00:06:54,200 --> 00:06:59,150
Anyway, you put a salamander in a jar, cover it with a leaf,

76
00:06:59,150 --> 00:07:04,990
wet the branch of a willow, tap the jar with it, and chant the spell.

77
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:08,190
Salamander, salamander...

78
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,420
"Bring forth the clouds, help the fog, and let the rain pour down."

79
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:14,930
"If you do, I will let you go."

80
00:07:14,930 --> 00:07:18,550
This is a palace custom. How do you know this?

81
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:24,120
- Oh 
 - Seo No.

82
00:07:29,710 --> 00:07:32,490
Seo No! What are you doing there?

83
00:07:32,490 --> 00:07:34,730
They are my friends, Father.

84
00:07:34,730 --> 00:07:38,120
Grandma! Are you all right?

85
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,280
I don't think you belong in a place like this.

86
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,900
Please go back to your home.

87
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,100
Seo No's father seems very strict.

88
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:26,590
 Keep the scribe's home in Dongjeokjeon under surveillance. 

89
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:31,910
 If anyone of royal lineage approaches the scribe, 

90
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,220
 regardless of his reason or position, 

91
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:40,130
 kill him by any means. 

92
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,210
Never, ever meet them again.

93
00:08:54,210 --> 00:08:58,310
They saved my life today.

94
00:08:58,310 --> 00:09:00,060
They said they will be my friends.

95
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,920
What friends?

96
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,960
Why do you dislike me?

97
00:09:38,870 --> 00:09:40,660
Why?

98
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:18,170
Hey, you rascals!

99
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,500
- Find them!
- Yes, sir.

100
00:11:18,890 --> 00:11:21,300
Why are we fleeing?

101
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,960
Someone was tailing us.

102
00:11:23,960 --> 00:11:28,600
Why? What did we do wrong?

103
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,120
Even if we did nothing wrong, we could die.

104
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:34,060
Pardon? What?

105
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:39,210
Since I am the Grand Prince. That's how I was trained since birth.

106
00:11:40,350 --> 00:11:45,780
If I detect danger, I need to avoid it before anything.

107
00:11:45,780 --> 00:11:48,000
Why? What?

108
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,520
 I mean, I didn't expect you to pay close attention to people. 

109
00:11:52,520 --> 00:11:56,530
 But why do you usually pretend otherwise? 

110
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:59,010
 By any chance, are you preparing to get married?
 

111
00:11:59,010 --> 00:12:02,450
 - What? 
- I mean, look. 

112
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:05,830
 Pretending not to have seen, not being able to hear. You also keep your mouth closed. 

113
00:12:05,830 --> 00:12:09,300
 I've heard that in order to survive, women have to live like that once they are married. 

114
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:13,330
 What you're doing is exactly like that. 

115
00:12:14,630 --> 00:12:19,590
 You're right. They say that's how you survive. Me too. 

116
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:54,100
I am afraid you will flee without me.

117
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,270
They couldn't have run far.

118
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,250
Find them.

119
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:16,520
 God of heaven and earth, please make them unable to see my footprints. Please. 

120
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:30,160
What do I do? They are coming this way.

121
00:14:32,050 --> 00:14:33,880
Coming.

122
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,250
It's all right. Don't be afraid.

123
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:26,190
It's raining.

124
00:15:34,830 --> 00:15:37,240
It's raining.

125
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,930
It's raining.

126
00:15:55,510 --> 00:16:00,690
  - Love live the King! 
 - Long live the King!  

127
00:16:00,690 --> 00:16:03,200
Is it really raining?

128
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:16,100
Congratulations, Your Majesty!

129
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:20,320
Your Majesty, hurray! Long live the King!

130
00:16:27,270 --> 00:16:29,790
Congratulations!

131
00:16:29,790 --> 00:16:36,230
 Royal Father, do you see this? Am I still unfit to be the king of this country? 

132
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:42,350
 I won't doubt it. 

133
00:16:42,350 --> 00:16:47,240
 I am the king of Joseon, both in name and deed. 

134
00:16:54,230 --> 00:16:56,320
Your Highness.

135
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,790
- Can you see the hut over there?
- Yes.

136
00:17:02,790 --> 00:17:05,440
Let's run over there.

137
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:14,210
Your Highness, it's raining. Congratulations!

138
00:17:14,210 --> 00:17:19,380
Yes, His Majesty's earnest plea reached the heavens.

139
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:21,520
Your Highness the Queen Dowager.

140
00:17:25,920 --> 00:17:27,620
Your Highness.

141
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:31,250
I am here to discuss the wedding of Grand Prince Jin Seong.

142
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,360
It's raining just in time; it must be an auspicious sign.

143
00:17:37,170 --> 00:17:40,710
I proposed marriage to the Chief Royal Secretary in person.

144
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:44,700
There is still no response. Thus...

145
00:17:52,270 --> 00:17:54,930
I have come with a written marriage proposal.

146
00:17:54,930 --> 00:17:58,040
I need to ask you to intervene.

147
00:17:58,040 --> 00:18:02,930
Most importantly, if Grand Prince Jin Seong becomes the son-in-law of His Highness' most trusted subject,

148
00:18:02,930 --> 00:18:06,780
the brotherly love between His Highness and the Grand Prince will grow.

149
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:12,200
Even up until several years ago, the two brothers deeply loved each other.

150
00:18:12,770 --> 00:18:19,220
I wish my sons could go back to those times.

151
00:18:19,220 --> 00:18:22,840
I don't have any other wish.

152
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:26,560
So please help.

153
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:36,560
I find everyday clothes more comfortable than ritual gowns.

154
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:40,830
Ritual gowns are too heavy and cumbersome.

155
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:46,990
Request the royal tailors to make my everyday clothes with lighter material in the future,

156
00:18:46,990 --> 00:18:50,000
and to tailor my sleeves to be narrower.

157
00:18:50,000 --> 00:18:51,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

158
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:53,580
What do you think?

159
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

160
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:59,360
If you make your sleeves narrow, I think it's more comfortable to move in them—

161
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:04,230
No, I am talking about Grand Prince Jin Seong.

162
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:13,510
Grand Prince Jin Seong did?

163
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:30,860
Is it finished?

164
00:19:30,860 --> 00:19:34,490
He's having a private meeting with the Chief Royal Secretary.

165
00:19:34,490 --> 00:19:37,970
He gave royal orders not to be interrupted by anyone.

166
00:19:37,970 --> 00:19:40,370
Am I anyone?

167
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,540
Yeok thought I was just saying it in the heat of the moment.

168
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:55,240
That's why he said he will never become your son-in-law.

169
00:19:56,860 --> 00:20:01,310
Being intolerant, I was a bit harsh with my words.

170
00:20:01,310 --> 00:20:07,200
However, my decision wasn't impulsive.

171
00:20:14,710 --> 00:20:19,050
As you are well aware, Yeok is not only my younger brother.

172
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:24,460
He is also the legitimate heir to this country and a strong political rival.

173
00:20:24,460 --> 00:20:26,390
But, Your Majesty...

174
00:20:26,390 --> 00:20:29,280
It's not because he's my beloved younger brother.

175
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,230
I need to be on guard against him. That's why I am giving him to you.

176
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:41,100
I cannot trust anyone else other than you.

177
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,980
Your Majesty, there is trouble.

178
00:20:45,980 --> 00:20:50,550
My prediction was right. It's about Dongjeokjeon village.

179
00:20:51,330 --> 00:20:52,940
Enter!

180
00:21:08,970 --> 00:21:10,980
Why is Yeok there?

181
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:14,470
Why is he there? Exactly why?!

182
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:16,870
It's just as we expected.

183
00:21:17,750 --> 00:21:23,110
Her Highness the Queen Dowager is aware of that fact

184
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,930
because she is the late king's queen.

185
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:33,550
Capture him. We'll find out when we interrogate him.

186
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,410
Yes, Your Majesty.

187
00:21:42,580 --> 00:21:45,600
  Will you truly betray my trust? 

188
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:50,970
  If by any chance, you know, I will never forgive you. 

189
00:22:11,250 --> 00:22:17,130
I came here today to tell you that I will never marry you.

190
00:22:19,600 --> 00:22:21,550
I'm not just anyone.

191
00:22:21,550 --> 00:22:24,800
If I get married to my older brother's most-trusted subject's daughter,

192
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:30,180
then others will assume that I suspect and fear my brother.

193
00:22:31,170 --> 00:22:34,300
It hurts my pride, and I hate it.

194
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:37,400
If we get married, won't both His Majesty the King, Your Highness the Grand Prince,

195
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:41,080
and our entire families be more harmonious?

196
00:22:41,080 --> 00:22:43,070
We're becoming family.

197
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,540
You're so naïve.

198
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:51,100
Earlier, when we were being chased by those suspicious people, I recited a spell to myself.

199
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:54,890
If we don't get caught by those people and escape safely,

200
00:22:54,890 --> 00:22:59,300
then that's a sign that the heavens are helping us.

201
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:03,130
It's the heavens encouraging us to not be afraid.

202
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:06,730
I guess you really are a girl after all.

203
00:23:06,730 --> 00:23:08,170
A superstitious spell like that—

204
00:23:08,170 --> 00:23:10,570
Even if it is superstitious!

205
00:23:10,570 --> 00:23:14,430
Thanks to that spell, I was able to muster up my courage.

206
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:23,460
That's why we shouldn't already be afraid of this world the adults created for themselves.

207
00:23:26,370 --> 00:23:29,060
You didn't do anything wrong, Your Highness.

208
00:23:30,440 --> 00:23:33,560
It's the world that is wrong.

209
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:57,960
You... like me, don't you?

210
00:23:57,960 --> 00:24:00,230
P-pardon?

211
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,940
Has the rain already stopped?

212
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:59,340
Now, even if we just throw a small pebble,

213
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:03,490
it will set off a significant wave,

214
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:07,000
because he's a sensitive ruler.

215
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:12,300
During the late King Seongjong's reign, he grew up with a wound buried deep within his heart.

216
00:25:16,210 --> 00:25:22,430
I no longer wish to see him in pain over the same issues.

217
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:32,000
  Giddy up! Giddy up! 

218
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:39,560
  Giddy up! Giddy up! Come on, giddy up! 

219
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:42,470
  Your Highness, are you having fun? 

220
00:25:42,470 --> 00:25:44,140
  Yeah. 

221
00:25:54,090 --> 00:25:55,660
  Giddy up! 

222
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:01,170
 Your Majesty, I, the Minister of Taxation, Sin Soo Geun, am here to see you. 

223
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,270
  Giddy up! Giddy up! 

224
00:26:05,270 --> 00:26:07,670
  - Giddy up! Giddy up!
- It's an honor, Your Majesty. 

225
00:26:07,670 --> 00:26:10,030
  Your Majesty the late King Seong Jong, 

226
00:26:10,030 --> 00:26:15,160
  you appointed me as a dog; 

227
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:20,470
  therefore, what other choice do I have than to become a real dog? 

228
00:26:21,230 --> 00:26:23,900
  Now, with the teeth of a beast, 

229
00:26:23,900 --> 00:26:31,240
  I'll kill Grand Prince Jin Seong, whom you loved so much. 

230
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:39,820
  Grand Prince Jin Seong must die so that His Majesty the King and I can rule Joseon. 

231
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:02,070
I told you to get on. Where will you go with that foot?

232
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,800
I can't.

233
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:16,470
Why? By any chance, are you being like this because of our genders?

234
00:27:16,470 --> 00:27:19,000
Something about the relationship between a man and a woman? That?

235
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,820
There are "countless"  (dialect)  reasons.

236
00:27:21,820 --> 00:27:24,130
Countless?

237
00:27:24,130 --> 00:27:27,900
It means that there are many reasons, Your Highness.

238
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,740
Then will you get on if I ask you to marry me?

239
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,710
I guess you came to like me too!

240
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,630
I'll be leaving first, Bird Poop.

241
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:47,030
What was that? Seriously!

242
00:27:47,030 --> 00:27:50,170
"What was that? Seriously!"

243
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:54,620
Your Highness!

244
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:33,380
See? You were going to have to get on anyway.

245
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:36,250
Come on now.

246
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:40,700
I'm only getting on because it's rude to continuously decline.

247
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:43,540
I'm not getting on because I want to, absolutely not.

248
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:44,910
Please keep that in mind.

249
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:47,510
Alright!

250
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,480
Why are you so heavy?

251
00:28:59,480 --> 00:29:04,430
What to do?! Hurry and put me down! Quickly, now!

252
00:29:06,340 --> 00:29:11,510
♫   You don't have to speak   ♫

253
00:29:11,510 --> 00:29:17,180
♫  You were here when I opened my eyes   ♫

254
00:29:17,180 --> 00:29:21,010
What was that?! Did you joke around again?! 
♫   The sight of you smiling so brightly   ♫

255
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:25,120
♫   Was blinding   ♫

256
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:34,240
♫   I'm staring at you whom I've imagined in my dreams   ♫

257
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:38,390
If we get married, let's live like friends and have fun, like this, forever. 
 ♫   A flower blooms in my heart   ♫

258
00:29:38,390 --> 00:29:45,960
♫   Unconsciously, I keep smiling   ♫

259
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,120
That's the end? 
 ♫  Love calls so   ♫

260
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:51,850
I won't be fooled again. You'll tease me again. 
♫   ride the clouds   ♫

261
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:55,020
I'm serious this time.

262
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:57,800
We can get married.

263
00:29:57,800 --> 00:30:01,680
But it won't be a political marriage.

264
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:03,560
I'm doing this marriage because I like you.

265
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:07,390
♫   It's just growing slowly   ♫

266
00:30:07,390 --> 00:30:12,120
♫   Don't you know how I feel?   ♫

267
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:21,500
Let's go!
♫   Your breath which comes whispering to me, we kiss   ♫

268
00:30:23,090 --> 00:30:30,050
♫   I'm staring at you whom I've imagined in my dreams   ♫

269
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:34,120
♫  A flower blooms in my heart   ♫

270
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:41,090
♫   Unconsciously, I keep smiling   ♫

271
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:43,220
♫   Love calls   ♫

272
00:30:43,220 --> 00:30:44,890
Why are you going so slowly? 
♫   So we ride   ♫

273
00:30:44,890 --> 00:30:46,740
It... it's just because you're too heavy. 
 ♫   the clouds   ♫

274
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:50,120
I said I'm not heavy!

275
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,380
Are you just going to continue to sit there?

276
00:31:09,950 --> 00:31:12,970
I've never thought you were wrong in my whole life.

277
00:31:12,970 --> 00:31:15,220
Until today.

278
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,300
Why did you do that?

279
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:29,770
If you become friends with people out of your league, you'll pay the price.

280
00:31:30,980 --> 00:31:35,190
People need to live according to their lot.

281
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:56,620
Father...

282
00:32:07,060 --> 00:32:11,490
We're here.

283
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:27,850
Do you have something to say or do you need to go to the bathroom?

284
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:40,380
If one made a vow, one should perform a ceremony.

285
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,870
If one made a promise, one should leave a token...

286
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,500
Isn't it human nature?

287
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,280
Here.

288
00:32:56,120 --> 00:33:00,370
Ah, stick your finger straight out.

289
00:33:17,810 --> 00:33:19,440
This one.

290
00:33:35,420 --> 00:33:38,040
It fits perfectly. A perfect fit.

291
00:33:45,150 --> 00:33:47,260
My token is—

292
00:33:59,780 --> 00:34:01,610
Grand Prince!

293
00:34:03,040 --> 00:34:04,850
Grand Prince!

294
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,730
Wh-what's the matter? What's wrong?

295
00:34:10,730 --> 00:34:12,510
Please save my father, Grand Prince.

296
00:34:12,510 --> 00:34:15,100
Grand Prince, my father might get killed.

297
00:34:15,100 --> 00:34:18,700
I am the one who stole the rice. Instead, they arrested my father.

298
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,620
What are you saying? We took care of everything. What happened?

299
00:34:27,620 --> 00:34:29,430
It can't be from that incident.

300
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:31,510
He's being held at the Uigeumbu  (Royal Investigation Bureau for treason and other serious crimes) for such a matter?

301
00:34:31,510 --> 00:34:36,520
I am the one who should be arrested, flogged, or otherwise punished.

302
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,470
Your Highness.

303
00:34:41,170 --> 00:34:43,090
Seo No, listen carefully.

304
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:47,430
As soon as the day breaks, I will go to the Uigeumbu right away to find out what's going on.

305
00:34:47,430 --> 00:34:51,680
No, I'll go and say that your father did no wrong, and I'll tell them to release him immediately.

306
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,640
So for now, just go home.

307
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:57,190
There definitely won't be any problems.

308
00:34:57,850 --> 00:34:59,740
Then what about me?

309
00:34:59,740 --> 00:35:02,970
Just practice speaking with a Hanyang accent.

310
00:35:02,970 --> 00:35:04,410
What?

311
00:35:07,030 --> 00:35:08,960
Your Highness!

312
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:12,860
Look after Seo No and his grandmother.

313
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:17,380
More things can go awry if you make any rash movements.

314
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:23,380
Your Highness!

315
00:35:23,380 --> 00:35:26,540
By any chance, if this happened because of the rice,

316
00:35:26,540 --> 00:35:30,590
I will take the punishment, so be sure to tell me.

317
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:34,000
It's not your fault. No way.

318
00:35:58,350 --> 00:36:00,650
Have mercy on me.

319
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:04,160
What is your name?

320
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,530
Mak Gae.

321
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:08,680
Tell me your real name.

322
00:36:10,030 --> 00:36:11,830
What do you mean my real name?

323
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,970
But what is your occupation?

324
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:17,510
There is no such thing as occupation.

325
00:36:17,510 --> 00:36:20,170
I farm the land and live from it.

326
00:36:20,170 --> 00:36:22,310
Shut up!

327
00:36:22,310 --> 00:36:24,980
If you tell another lie,

328
00:36:24,980 --> 00:36:29,440
I won't ask you with words then. Name?

329
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:36,800
Mak ... Mak Gae. It's Mak Gae.

330
00:36:49,950 --> 00:36:53,710
Are you the scribe who recorded the late king's daily activities?

331
00:36:53,710 --> 00:36:56,580
I don't know what you're talking about...

332
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,770
How do you know the Grand Prince Jin Seong?

333
00:36:58,770 --> 00:37:03,050
If you mean Grand Prince Jin Seong...

334
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:04,950
Why did Grand Prince Jin Seong go to your house?

335
00:37:04,950 --> 00:37:07,320
Why was he at your house together with your son?!

336
00:37:07,320 --> 00:37:12,370
That's a misunderstanding. The Grand Prince doesn't know anything.

337
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,020
What?

338
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:31,240
What doesn't the Grand Prince know?

339
00:37:48,650 --> 00:37:51,160
 It's a misunderstanding. A misunderstanding. 

340
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:54,390
 The Grand Prince doesn't know anything. 

341
00:37:54,390 --> 00:38:01,520
 A family lives together and even dies together. 

342
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:06,830
 You were wrong. We can't be like that. 

343
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,530
Throw it out. Throw everything out.

344
00:38:51,460 --> 00:38:55,410
Your Highness, about the issue of the wedding...

345
00:38:56,450 --> 00:38:59,290
It doesn't seem to be the right time now.

346
00:39:02,780 --> 00:39:05,120
Father, it's Chae Gyeong.

347
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,910
Come in.

348
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:16,110
Your Highness the Queen.

349
00:39:19,590 --> 00:39:25,370
It's Chae Gyeong. You were a little child, but now you're  a young woman.

350
00:39:26,860 --> 00:39:29,080
Why aren't you sleeping?

351
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,730
By any chance, did you read the letter inside?

352
00:39:43,730 --> 00:39:47,850
No. I really didn't see it.

353
00:39:47,850 --> 00:39:49,380
It's fine then.

354
00:39:49,380 --> 00:39:52,790
I already heard about its contents from the nanny.

355
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:58,160
Go and sleep now.

356
00:39:58,160 --> 00:40:02,160
We have important things to discuss with the Queen.

357
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:09,810
Your Highness, by any chance, today at the Uigeumbu...

358
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:18,260
It's nothing.

359
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:35,650
 Please look after Seo No and his grandmother. 

360
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:40,150
 More things can go awry if you make any rash movements. 

361
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:12,190
 If Chae Gyeong meets a royal, please don't forget my prophecy of a bloodbath 

362
00:41:12,190 --> 00:41:14,130
 raining upon the royal court and royal family. 

363
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:16,210
 Buddhist monk! 

364
00:41:16,210 --> 00:41:22,790
 Don't trust the late king. 

365
00:41:22,790 --> 00:41:28,860
 If Chae Gyeong marries into the royal family, the royal court and the royal family 

366
00:41:28,860 --> 00:41:33,350
 will be soaked in a bloodbath. 

367
00:41:35,700 --> 00:41:37,320
Brother.

368
00:41:38,610 --> 00:41:42,880
That's impossible. Please do whatever it takes to prevent it.

369
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:47,910
Your Highness, Chae Gyeong cannot marry Grand Prince Jin Seong.

370
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,750
Your Highness! Your Highness!

371
00:41:54,750 --> 00:41:57,430
Let go of me! Yesterday—

372
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,080
Your Highness.

373
00:42:01,080 --> 00:42:05,090
Your Highness, what brings you all the way here?

374
00:42:05,880 --> 00:42:10,480
I'm sure you know. What is the reason?

375
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:20,050
The village of Dongjeokjeon is land that is cared for by the royal family.

376
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:24,420
All crops harvested from that designated land are to be offered to His Majesty the King.

377
00:42:24,420 --> 00:42:27,460
It's a crime to steal that rice, a crime of embezzlement.

378
00:42:27,460 --> 00:42:31,580
That's impossible. I made up for the missing amount of  rice offering.

379
00:42:31,580 --> 00:42:36,630
Because of that, the crime of contempt against His Majesty the King has been added.

380
00:42:36,630 --> 00:42:39,690
It wasn't enough that they stole the rice meant to be offered to His Majesty the King for their personal use, yet,

381
00:42:39,690 --> 00:42:43,020
even when such a crime was committed,

382
00:42:43,020 --> 00:42:46,770
they did not notify their superiors of the fact.

383
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:49,200
That's a crime of contempt against His Majesty the King.

384
00:42:49,200 --> 00:42:52,310
Your Highness, you know just as well

385
00:42:52,310 --> 00:42:58,970
that these days, the crime of contempt against His Majesty the King is just as severe as the crime of treason.

386
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:07,390
His Majesty will not forgive the sin of humiliating and looking down on the king and the royal family.

387
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,700
It's just one mal  (18 liters)  of rice.

388
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:14,530
from the crops that those people have planted and harvested all through spring and summer.

389
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:17,280
A portion of their own shares were included in that harvest; it's just one mal.

390
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:20,460
Whether it's one mal or one grain,

391
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:24,190
it doesn't change the fact that all belong to His Majesty the King.

392
00:43:24,190 --> 00:43:26,590
So, you're planning to punish him?

393
00:43:26,590 --> 00:43:32,930
The punishment for contempt against His Majesty the King is execution, Your Highness.

394
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,810
Your Majesty! Please listen to me!

395
00:43:49,810 --> 00:43:54,000
Please save him! He's innocent!

396
00:43:54,890 --> 00:43:56,480
Leave.

397
00:44:00,300 --> 00:44:03,960
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Hyungnim!

398
00:44:03,960 --> 00:44:07,010
His Majesty the King is entering!

399
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:10,900
We greet you, Your Majesty!

400
00:44:11,930 --> 00:44:16,750
Your Majesty! I'll wait here until you finish your council meeting!

401
00:44:49,390 --> 00:44:55,870
  The moment he sees the entrance pass granted by His Majesty the King, he'll wish to save the man trapped in the cell, even if he has to defy the royal command, 

402
00:44:55,870 --> 00:44:59,570
  without knowing that it'll lead to his own death. 

403
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:06,630
Your Majesty! Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

404
00:45:11,920 --> 00:45:17,440
I told you to leave. Are you planning to defy my wishes until the end?

405
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:21,660
But execution? How is that a crime worthy of death?

406
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:24,010
No, he's innocent.

407
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:27,000
The crime of looking down on me!

408
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:30,100
What greater crime could there be?

409
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:34,710
Although there is no greater crime than that, there is something above that:

410
00:45:36,590 --> 00:45:39,190
someone's life.

411
00:45:39,190 --> 00:45:43,710
Then, are you telling me that I've arrested

412
00:45:43,710 --> 00:45:47,740
an innocent person and now fabricating the crime log?

413
00:45:47,740 --> 00:45:48,800
That's not what I meant—

414
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:54,680
Then, are you planning to defy a royal command and interfere with this nation's politics?

415
00:45:54,680 --> 00:45:57,050
- N-no.
- Then?

416
00:45:58,360 --> 00:46:01,850
I'm just offering the suggestion that there could have been a misunderstanding.

417
00:46:01,850 --> 00:46:06,180
I'm objecting to the punishment as it might be too severe for the crime.

418
00:46:06,180 --> 00:46:11,060
You could open a council meeting with all of the ministers present or conduct a trial through the Investigation Bureau.

419
00:46:11,060 --> 00:46:15,300
I'm requesting a chance for him to be judged without discrimination.

420
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:26,490
You're still the same. You still believe your judgment is above my decision.

421
00:46:34,030 --> 00:46:37,030
Listen up, younger brother.

422
00:46:38,500 --> 00:46:41,590
What you need right now is not that trial

423
00:46:41,590 --> 00:46:46,590
but my forgiveness, understanding, and generosity.

424
00:46:47,830 --> 00:46:53,370
After you've fixed your habit of going against my decisions, come back again.

425
00:46:57,030 --> 00:46:58,270
Hyungnim!

426
00:46:58,270 --> 00:46:59,690
How dare you?!

427
00:47:01,330 --> 00:47:04,790
- Your Majesty!
- Your Majesty! Your Majesty!

428
00:47:04,790 --> 00:47:06,810
Your Majesty...

429
00:47:06,810 --> 00:47:09,050
Your Majesty!

430
00:47:09,050 --> 00:47:11,840
- Call the royal physician! Now! 
 - Yes, sir!

431
00:47:20,730 --> 00:47:24,150
Your Majesty, let's go.

432
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,460
 Seonjeon (King's Herald) 

433
00:48:00,350 --> 00:48:01,870
Seo No!

434
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,080
Seo No—

435
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,990
S-Seo No?

436
00:48:32,670 --> 00:48:34,290
Seo No!

437
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,510
I...

438
00:48:39,990 --> 00:48:44,600
It's all because of me. It's all because of me!

439
00:48:49,450 --> 00:48:53,260
  It's all my fault. If I hadn't gotten involved... 

440
00:49:02,060 --> 00:49:11,290
  Please help me. Father, Mother, Your Majesty the King, Your Highness the Grand Prince... 

441
00:49:13,170 --> 00:49:18,400
There has to be a limit to your immaturity. Exactly what were you thinking?

442
00:49:19,250 --> 00:49:22,340
How is the atmosphere among the ministers?

443
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:25,950
It was quite refreshing.

444
00:49:25,950 --> 00:49:31,200
"You can call all of the ministers and have a meeting. Please conduct a trial."

445
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:34,420
Those were words we hadn't heard in a while.

446
00:49:34,420 --> 00:49:41,600
There were also those who questioned who else aside from you, Your Highness, could suggest a proposal that went against His Majesty's decision.

447
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:43,910
Did they take interest?

448
00:49:43,910 --> 00:49:47,130
Not in me, but in the Dongjeokjeon village case.

449
00:49:47,130 --> 00:49:50,420
They'd have to risk the lives of their whole family.

450
00:49:54,530 --> 00:50:00,820
Who would dare to stand against His Majesty the King over such a trivial case?

451
00:50:08,210 --> 00:50:14,030
You had a problem with my decision. However! I will forgive you.

452
00:50:17,770 --> 00:50:22,790
You dared to talk back to me in the presence of court officials. However ...

453
00:50:22,790 --> 00:50:24,720
I will forgive you.

454
00:50:26,670 --> 00:50:30,970
I'll even forgive your insolent words of "no one innocent should die."

455
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:39,560
However, if the reason you're monitoring and protecting the scribe is because of the secret order,

456
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:44,930
if you're waiting until you're an adult so you can mock and humiliate me...

457
00:50:52,100 --> 00:50:54,800
 Your Majesty, you'll hurt yourself. 

458
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,440
I'll never forgive you!

459
00:51:03,140 --> 00:51:05,640
I'll kill you with my own hands.

460
00:51:15,330 --> 00:51:19,080
The gates closed a moment ago, Your Highness.

461
00:51:26,380 --> 00:51:29,270
- Open the gates!
-  Yes, sir! 

462
00:51:43,660 --> 00:51:46,630
Why are you acting up too?

463
00:52:02,210 --> 00:52:04,290
Why did you come here?

464
00:52:13,070 --> 00:52:14,360
How did it go?

465
00:52:14,360 --> 00:52:15,580
Don't concern yourself with it.

466
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:19,660
How can I do that? Seo No's grandmother passed away.

467
00:52:19,660 --> 00:52:23,830
Seo No's father has to come for them to proceed with the funeral!

468
00:52:23,830 --> 00:52:26,690
When? Why?

469
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:32,660
After she discovered her son was arrested, she ran after him but collapsed.

470
00:52:32,660 --> 00:52:37,190
She was already seriously sick, but received a great shock.

471
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:47,850
Tell me the truth.

472
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:53,190
A royal command has been given to behead him.

473
00:52:57,030 --> 00:53:01,490
 Geum Oh Moon: Main gate of Uigeumbu 

474
00:53:05,100 --> 00:53:07,470
 King's Herald 

475
00:53:07,470 --> 00:53:10,120
I'm going to bring him out.

476
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:13,970
If you do that, all of the blame will be put on you...

477
00:53:13,970 --> 00:53:16,270
Let's not do that. Instead, let's ask my father—

478
00:53:16,270 --> 00:53:18,320
Who are you trusting?!

479
00:53:18,320 --> 00:53:21,980
The Chief Royal Secretary is someone who would willingly die at His Majesty the King's command.

480
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:26,850
Don't look at me like that. You're not the only one who is hurt.

481
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:29,000
I'm about to go crazy too.

482
00:53:29,000 --> 00:53:31,390
How is no one stopping this?!

483
00:53:31,390 --> 00:53:33,450
I'll ask them one more time.

484
00:53:33,450 --> 00:53:38,840
Father, Mother, Uncle, Her Highness the Queen, I'll meet them all.

485
00:53:38,840 --> 00:53:42,260
If that still doesn't work, I'll ask His Majesty the King—

486
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:45,160
Are you bragging about your backing?

487
00:53:45,160 --> 00:53:50,120
Because you're the precious only child of his most trusted subject, the king who would make even the birds flying in the sky drop from fear,

488
00:53:50,120 --> 00:53:52,300
do you think he will listen to you?

489
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:53,150
Your Highness...

490
00:53:53,150 --> 00:53:56,390
While you're confirming how strong your backing is,

491
00:53:56,390 --> 00:53:59,690
what are you going to do if Seo No's father dies? Will you take responsibility then?

492
00:53:59,690 --> 00:54:01,290
Why would you say that?!

493
00:54:01,290 --> 00:54:06,630
I asked you to just forget about it, but you're the one who interfered in this matter blabbering about saving lives!

494
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:10,800
Does it look like I don't know that? I'm regretting it so much right now because of that!

495
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:13,070
Then stay out of this!

496
00:54:16,380 --> 00:54:18,320
You said you regret it.

497
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:23,670
So you, the scared daughter of the Chief Royal Secretary, can stay out of this.

498
00:54:29,260 --> 00:54:33,990
If you try to stop me one more time, I won't ever see you again.

499
00:54:56,990 --> 00:54:59,270
 King's Herald 

500
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:27,020
Look here! Come to your senses!

501
00:55:27,020 --> 00:55:28,910
Hurry!

502
00:55:31,060 --> 00:55:34,530
His Majesty the King has taken into account a special situation, the drought,

503
00:55:34,530 --> 00:55:37,430
and said he would not punish you for your crimes this time.

504
00:55:37,430 --> 00:55:38,990
Hurry!

505
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:44,180
You can't, Your Highness!

506
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:48,500
You... you cannot get involved in this matter.

507
00:55:48,500 --> 00:55:54,610
Please... please just ignore me.

508
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:59,270
Hurry and release him! Hurry!

509
00:56:05,550 --> 00:56:12,260
Please... please just leave me alone.

510
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:16,660
I did this. I can't leave you to die because of me.

511
00:56:16,660 --> 00:56:21,660
Your Highness, that's only an excuse...

512
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:32,390
You!

513
00:56:32,390 --> 00:56:34,970
Your Highness! Father!

514
00:56:37,400 --> 00:56:41,630
Did you think I would've been just whistling around out here?

515
00:56:50,730 --> 00:56:52,870
So you released the criminal?

516
00:56:52,870 --> 00:56:56,540
- His Highness the Grand Prince requested...
- Chase them, hurry!

517
00:56:56,540 --> 00:56:57,500
Yes!

518
00:56:57,500 --> 00:56:59,620
Stop.

519
00:57:31,380 --> 00:57:34,280
They went that way. Chase them!

520
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:48,860
Father.

521
00:57:51,130 --> 00:57:53,170
From here on, go by yourselves.

522
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:54,400
Pardon?

523
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,090
I have to end this matter and buy time for him to escape.

524
00:57:59,090 --> 00:58:01,090
H-how?

525
00:58:01,090 --> 00:58:02,360
By my method.

526
00:58:02,360 --> 00:58:03,480
But—

527
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,980
Please! Can't you just listen to me, just this once?

528
00:58:09,470 --> 00:58:11,920
Move quickly! Hurry!

529
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,380
Seo No!

530
00:58:56,190 --> 00:58:59,330
They must be near here! Search the area!

531
00:58:59,330 --> 00:59:01,060
Yes!

532
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:18,520
Seo No, Seo No, let's take a quick break.

533
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,970
Father. Father, please come to your senses.

534
00:59:46,600 --> 00:59:49,390
Seo No, move quickly.

535
00:59:49,390 --> 00:59:54,700
My relative is leaving for Namdo for his governor post.

536
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:56,550
Quickly!

537
00:59:57,540 --> 00:59:59,310
Two, three!

538
01:00:01,560 --> 01:00:04,920
Let's go, hurry! We must leave before the sun rises.

539
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:06,400
Yes, sir!

540
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:07,750
Here, here, here.

541
01:00:07,750 --> 01:00:10,810
Now, be careful. Place it here.

542
01:00:13,790 --> 01:00:16,260
Hurry! Hurry!

543
01:00:18,290 --> 01:00:24,040
I am rushing him on his way since his lung disease can only be treated in Namdo's warm weather.

544
01:00:24,040 --> 01:00:26,180
So please take good care of him.

545
01:00:26,180 --> 01:00:31,140
Yes, understood. The Elder has granted his permission, so I'm just following his orders.

546
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:34,120
He's my friend so please treat him well, alright?

547
01:00:34,120 --> 01:00:35,970
Don't worry too much.

548
01:00:35,970 --> 01:00:39,230
It seems he'll work for his share.

549
01:00:41,970 --> 01:00:43,750
Hurry, hurry!

550
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:53,170
Eat this on the way there.

551
01:00:53,170 --> 01:00:55,090
- Hurry, hurry!
- Come on, quickly!

552
01:00:55,090 --> 01:00:56,710
 This side. 

553
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:02,350
What about His Highness the Grand Prince and you, Young Lady?

554
01:01:02,350 --> 01:01:05,990
Who do you think we are? I doubt they'll actually kill us.

555
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:13,600
I'll repay this debt one day.

556
01:01:13,600 --> 01:01:16,420
Is there a debt between friends?

557
01:01:18,160 --> 01:01:21,020
Thank you...

558
01:01:39,550 --> 01:01:41,470
Stop right there!

559
01:02:05,250 --> 01:02:07,270
  Royal Father. 

560
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:43,790
Did you have another nightmare?

561
01:02:43,790 --> 01:02:46,280
What time is it?

562
01:02:46,280 --> 01:02:50,140
It's been about an hour since paru* rang.
 (bell to announce beginning and end of the curfew) 

563
01:02:53,400 --> 01:02:55,560
  Your Majesty! 

564
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:18,890
Was it really your doing?

565
01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:21,240
Yes.

566
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:22,830
Why?

567
01:03:23,640 --> 01:03:25,850
Why did you do that? Huh?

568
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:28,160
Exactly why?!

569
01:03:29,000 --> 01:03:33,310
Because... of the throne.

570
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:35,050
What?

571
01:03:41,020 --> 01:03:46,230
Did you just say it was because of the throne?
