1
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:44,260
Episode 7

2
00:00:51,110 --> 00:00:55,050
It is you. I know it's you.

3
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,000
Why are you lying? Why are you denying it?

4
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,620
It is you.

5
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,500
You are him.

6
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,180
- Oh my, maiden.
- Are you alright?

7
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,990
That way.

8
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,450
Stop.

9
00:02:10,960 --> 00:02:14,530
If we lose him, it's our heads that will roll. Search every inch.

10
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:16,340
Yes.

11
00:02:39,830 --> 00:02:43,930
Why are we being chased? Who are those people?

12
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:46,580
It's because you meddled with other people's affairs.

13
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:50,050
Why?

14
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,140
It must hurt-

15
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:20,210
Why did you lie? How long were you going to keep lying?

16
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:25,410
Didn't you feel bad whenever you saw me chasing you like a fool?

17
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,520
You are too much.

18
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:32,180
Do you know how anxious I was for the past several days?

19
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:34,840
No, it's not several days, it's several years.

20
00:04:35,850 --> 00:04:39,190
Do you know how hard it was for me?

21
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:42,310
I didn't even know you were alive and fine like this.

22
00:04:43,170 --> 00:04:46,040
Do I look like I am doing fine?

23
00:04:46,040 --> 00:04:51,360
Why did I pretend to not know you? How long was I going to keep up the act?

24
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:55,940
If possible, I would have kept it up forever. I would have pretended like I didn't know you.

25
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:02,230
You're dense, stubborn, nosy for no reason, and don't have any fear whatsoever.

26
00:05:02,230 --> 00:05:06,080
Look at this! Whenever I am with you, I get entangled into dangerous incidents.

27
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:13,160
Did you really not miss me?

28
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,420
What do you think?

29
00:05:28,170 --> 00:05:29,870
Right.

30
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:37,080
Once, I lived as Grand Prince Jin Seong and Lee Yeok.

31
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,500
Until I died when I was ambushed by assassins

32
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:44,570
on my way to exile.

33
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:48,200
Assassins?

34
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:50,350
Hit by an arrow,

35
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:53,610
stabbed with a knife,

36
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,560
I rolled down a cliff with no breath left.

37
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:03,530
The boy who should have been long dead...

38
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:09,460
survived like a miracle.

39
00:06:10,510 --> 00:06:16,190
W-who did such a thing?

40
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:22,850
You could ask your brother, the king, for help.

41
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,470
Because of such naive thinking,

42
00:06:27,470 --> 00:06:29,890
I should have died earlier.

43
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:36,470
If you wish for me to die again, stop anyone and ask for help.

44
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:50,700
You may use the Royal Guard, Royal Investigative Bureau, the Police Bureau,

45
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:53,640
the royal forces, or soldiers. Whatever is necessary.

46
00:06:53,640 --> 00:06:56,580
I will find him and dispose of him immediately.

47
00:06:56,580 --> 00:07:00,780
No. Bring him to me.

48
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:06,120
I must see him with my own two eyes.

49
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:09,500
Geum Oh Moon: Main gate of the Royal Investigative Bureau

50
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:27,380
Give me some troops to catch a thief.

51
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,580
Close the gate and inspect every single person entering or leaving through the gate.

52
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,430
He's not at the eastern valley.

53
00:08:01,410 --> 00:08:04,040
But I am relieved.

54
00:08:04,670 --> 00:08:09,320
The person I came to like is you, Your Highness.

55
00:08:14,010 --> 00:08:16,600
I was worried,

56
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:20,420
that I might have given my heart to a weird bastard.

57
00:08:27,210 --> 00:08:29,960
Let's stay together

58
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:33,330
until the sun rises.

59
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,690
It'll be the last time.

60
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:48,470
When the sun rises,

61
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:54,510
I will never utter your name again.

62
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,370
I won't miss you

63
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,490
nor wait for you.

64
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:06,490
The promise I have made

65
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,350
is now invalid.

66
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,160
- Search the area.
- Yes.

67
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:42,170
The Chief Royal Secretary personally led the Royal Investigative Bureau troops.

68
00:09:42,170 --> 00:09:45,510
We need to find Orabeoni before they do.

69
00:10:07,690 --> 00:10:13,360
♫ You approached silently ♫

70
00:10:14,690 --> 00:10:21,340
♫ You smiled at me while offering your hand ♫

71
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:29,260
♫ The time we spent together ♫

72
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:34,800
♫ Is going far away like a dream ♫

73
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:43,780
Hit by an arrow, stabbed with a knife, I rolled down a cliff with no breath left.

74
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,570
The boy who should have been long dead survived like a miracle.

75
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:57,870
♫ I can't do anything else but leave even though I don't want to go ♫

76
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:05,580
♫ I know now that I can't live without you ♫

77
00:11:05,580 --> 00:11:12,400
♫ Don't go away. I won't be able to see you again. ♫

78
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:19,690
♫ I love you once again ♫

79
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:49,960
Where is the man?

80
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,460
Drag her.

81
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:11,610
Wait. Should we gather others and follow them?

82
00:12:11,610 --> 00:12:15,830
I think they are going deep into the mountain. Don't you think we would be too late?

83
00:12:18,340 --> 00:12:20,440
Did anyone get hurt?

84
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:25,280
Yes. She was washing a bloody bandage.

85
00:12:25,280 --> 00:12:29,680
Then he's around here somewhere. This is Asian Lizard's tail (Saururus chinensis). It only grows around streams.

86
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:33,130
Then, why are those people headed towards Stone Mountain?

87
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,240
Where is that bastard?

88
00:13:11,230 --> 00:13:13,220
I said, where is that bastard?

89
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:36,400
You're here, Lord.

90
00:13:40,350 --> 00:13:42,860
I was continuing the search around the area.

91
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:45,340
That must mean you haven't caught him yet.

92
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:49,290
Instead, I caught the girl who helped him escape.

93
00:13:49,290 --> 00:13:52,020
It's the girl you told me about.

94
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:01,790
Look who's here.

95
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:05,760
You're Minister Sin Soo Geun's precious daughter.

96
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:20,020
A precious one has helped a thief escape?

97
00:14:20,020 --> 00:14:21,620
Where is he?

98
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,080
You could ask your brother, the king, for help.

99
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:28,790
Because of such naive thinking,

100
00:14:29,290 --> 00:14:31,570
I should have died earlier.

101
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:58,270
Chae Gyeong... Why has she been captured?

102
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:03,190
The man you have ordered to find...

103
00:15:04,090 --> 00:15:11,470
Miss Sin was with the man all night long and misled the royal forces,

104
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:15,440
and helped him escape.

105
00:15:16,220 --> 00:15:21,340
But still, how can we put her behind bars?

106
00:15:21,340 --> 00:15:30,780
Your Majesty, to be honest, he is a thief that robbed the ship with royal offerings.

107
00:15:30,780 --> 00:15:37,360
Robbed a ship? It wasn't the storm that sank the royal offerings?

108
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:39,940
I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty.

109
00:15:39,940 --> 00:15:42,920
To report such trivial matters to you-

110
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:48,650
So, that bastard who looks like the Grand Prince Jin Seong is the culprit in the theft of royal offerings,

111
00:15:48,650 --> 00:15:52,520
Chae Gyeong, unaware of this, is captured for helping him escape?

112
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:57,800
Whether she knew or were unaware of the theft,

113
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:01,470
we would only know after hearing her confession.

114
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,700
I have to hear it from Chae Gyeong herself.

115
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,150
Your Majesty.

116
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:43,250
Did you say he's a thief that stole the royal offerings?

117
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:45,740
That's not true. He is...

118
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:52,180
He is only a merchant.

119
00:16:52,180 --> 00:16:54,240
That merchant has deceived you.

120
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,400
I wasn't deceived.

121
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,780
Then,

122
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:05,840
tell me everything you know about him. I will release you once he's captured.

123
00:17:07,180 --> 00:17:09,520
I don't know anything.

124
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:14,340
I just happened to be with him.

125
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:17,270
You don't know?

126
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:18,860
Yes, I don't.

127
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:21,250
You don't know anything.

128
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,920
Yes, I don't.

129
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:29,570
Do you really intend to deceive me?

130
00:17:29,570 --> 00:17:32,320
You even lie to me?

131
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,170
Is it because of Yeok?

132
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,820
Just because he looks like Yeok, you dare try to fool me?

133
00:17:43,820 --> 00:17:46,670
He might have been set up.

134
00:17:46,670 --> 00:17:49,930
It's possible that someone set a trap to harm him.

135
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:54,450
Who exactly is he that someone will set a trap to catch one person?

136
00:17:59,260 --> 00:18:02,130
I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty.

137
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:05,690
I have nothing more to say.

138
00:18:06,940 --> 00:18:11,770
Chae Gyeong wouldn't act this way just because he looks like Yeok.

139
00:18:12,710 --> 00:18:17,520
She even defended him saying he might have been set up.

140
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:24,610
Your Majesty, you'll find out once you capture the thief.

141
00:18:24,610 --> 00:18:31,030
For now, Miss Sin is the only way to catch that bastard.

142
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,230
Please spread the news around the capital that Miss Sin has been captured.

143
00:18:35,230 --> 00:18:37,160
Head Eunuch.

144
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:38,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

145
00:18:42,100 --> 00:18:46,870
How is Her Highness the Queen Dowager doing lately?

146
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,090
Using the juice of mugwort, I made green color this time.

147
00:19:04,090 --> 00:19:06,910
Don't you think the color is prettier than the noodles I made last year?

148
00:19:06,910 --> 00:19:09,940
Indeed it is so.

149
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,400
However, why isn't the Queen here with us today?

150
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:19,400
A disgraceful incident happened at her private house outside of the palace, so she's lying low in her chambers.

151
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,230
The news about the First Vice Premier's daughter being held at the Royal Investigative Bureau

152
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:25,460
must be true.

153
00:19:26,820 --> 00:19:30,950
Too bad a disgraceful incident occurred on an auspicious day.

154
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:37,480
Court Lady Joo.

155
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:39,540
Yes, Your Highness.

156
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:43,060
This is a gift for the Queen. Please set it aside.

157
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,420
Yes.

158
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,970
So threading flour balls like beads and wearing it on the body

159
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:06,950
or hanging it over the doorpost is known to chase away the evil spirits.

160
00:20:06,950 --> 00:20:09,730
It's something that the Queen Dowager and court ladies

161
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:12,920
have been doing on June 15th of each year.

162
00:20:35,470 --> 00:20:38,570
Bullseye.

163
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:42,980
Are you trying to deceive me, Queen Dowager?

164
00:20:57,370 --> 00:21:02,420
I think His Majesty has figured out that Grand Prince Jin Seong is alive.

165
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:06,780
He has personally checked on the Queen Dowager's movements.

166
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:09,290
How about the Queen Dowager?

167
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:13,760
There is no way she would be unaware of her only son's death.

168
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,480
Normally, if she knew Miss Sin was being held at the Royal Investigative Bureau,

169
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:22,410
she would have somehow blown this up to bring down the First Vice Premier.

170
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:25,360
She's being too quiet about it.

171
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:31,440
Thus, His Majesty is even more sure of the truth.

172
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:37,260
Your Majesty.

173
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:41,040
Your Majesty, are you alright?

174
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,800
King Seong Jong, father of the two brothers: the current king Yeonsangun and Grand Prince Jin Seong

175
00:22:00,800 --> 00:22:05,700
When Grand Prince Jin Seong becomes an adult, hand over the throne to him.

176
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:19,300
Your Majesty.

177
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:21,350
Chief Royal Secretary.

178
00:22:22,220 --> 00:22:24,810
Yes, Your Majesty.

179
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,950
The sin of killing my younger brother without my order,

180
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:34,920
or the sin of letting my younger brother, whom I thought was dead, return alive.

181
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:39,080
Out of the two, which sin do you think is the greater and more serious?

182
00:22:44,890 --> 00:22:48,670
At that time, I pretended that I didn't know.

183
00:22:48,670 --> 00:22:52,710
Because, thanks to that, for the first time in many years,

184
00:22:52,710 --> 00:22:56,790
I felt what freedom was.

185
00:22:57,620 --> 00:23:02,590
Because the will of my late father, His Majesty, and my mother, who died as a deposed queen,

186
00:23:02,590 --> 00:23:10,790
the court officials' prejudice and checks against that dirty blood and anxiety and fury from it all,

187
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:16,850
disappeared together with that child.

188
00:23:16,850 --> 00:23:22,170
However, all of that is coming back.

189
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:27,370
with the blame for killing my own brother added on top of that.

190
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:31,310
I-I apologise, Your Majesty.

191
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:53,560
I give you full authority over this matter, so keep in mind.

192
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:57,000
The day that this freedom ends,

193
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:02,660
your riches, honors, power, and everything else you gained in return,

194
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:07,020
all will be lost.

195
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,290
I will keep that in mind.

196
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:27,720
What are you planning to do?

197
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:30,180
Do you think it can be unravelled?

198
00:24:30,570 --> 00:24:35,890
If I am not to die, I must kill others.

199
00:24:37,220 --> 00:24:39,590
As I have always done.

200
00:24:39,590 --> 00:24:41,670
Bulletin

201
00:24:41,670 --> 00:24:49,400
Around June 8th, this man stole the royal offerings from the three southern provinces

202
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:53,790
and using Miss Sin, he misled the Royal Forces and escaped.

203
00:24:53,790 --> 00:24:58,050
If he is not caught by the Hour of the Rooster (5-7 PM) on the 30th,

204
00:24:58,050 --> 00:25:01,820
all charges will be brought against Miss Sin who had already been arrested

205
00:25:01,820 --> 00:25:04,690
and Miss Sin will be severely punished.

206
00:25:04,690 --> 00:25:06,790
Apparently, the royal offering thief has escaped.

207
00:25:06,790 --> 00:25:11,370
He's on the run after putting all the blame on the girl.

208
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:16,810
They're just blatantly telling Yeok to come to the palace. It's an invitation.

209
00:25:16,810 --> 00:25:19,510
If Yeok finds out, I expect he won't stay put.

210
00:26:22,890 --> 00:26:27,930
I'm sorry. You were shocked, weren't you?

211
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,320
It will soon be resolved.

212
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,260
When it is resolved,

213
00:26:34,790 --> 00:26:37,640
go with your mother to Gochang.

214
00:26:37,640 --> 00:26:44,450
Get married or just raise chickens or something with your mother in Gochang.

215
00:26:47,060 --> 00:26:51,470
If you try to force anything, it's bound to go wrong.

216
00:26:51,470 --> 00:26:55,610
After leaving you alone in Gochang for so long,

217
00:26:55,610 --> 00:27:01,030
now, I forced you to follow the customs of Joseon.

218
00:27:09,530 --> 00:27:11,390
The Royal Investigative Bureau posted bulletins

219
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:19,060
declaring that if he's not here by the Hour of the Rooster (5-7 PM) on the 30th, you'll be paying for all the crimes.

220
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:21,990
Do you think he will come to save you?

221
00:27:21,990 --> 00:27:26,640
No! He can't come.

222
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,580
That person is not a thief.

223
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:34,570
He just saved me who was in danger.

224
00:27:34,570 --> 00:27:39,480
If he is innocent, why did he run away? And why are you hiding him?

225
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,470
Don't you know that you don't have to have committed a crime to die?

226
00:27:42,470 --> 00:27:46,750
Shouldn't he come here and prove his innocence?

227
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:50,600
I've seen people die even though they have committed no crime.

228
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:54,060
I've seen people chased even though they have committed no crime.

229
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:59,470
Someone proclaiming innocence does not guarantee safety.

230
00:28:02,540 --> 00:28:08,040
So, you are saying that you will take the punishment instead?

231
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:13,170
Yes, it is better that I take the punishment.

232
00:28:13,170 --> 00:28:14,460
Sin Chae Gyeong!

233
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:15,930
It was my fault.

234
00:28:15,930 --> 00:28:20,870
Father, Mother, I will accept the punishment.

235
00:28:20,870 --> 00:28:24,420
I will accept the punishment.

236
00:28:24,420 --> 00:28:29,240
I will not let anyone get hurt or die again because of me.

237
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:43,960
What on earth happened to our Chae Gyeong after coming to Hanyang?

238
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:49,370
As you are aware, I followed her a step too late.

239
00:28:49,370 --> 00:28:56,000
However, after meeting her again, she did seem a bit different from normal.

240
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:59,800
Looking at a bean like thing and saying she had seen a ghost.

241
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:03,150
She said that there was a ghost that resembled the Grand Prince.

242
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:07,810
Do you mean Grand Prince Jin Seong?

243
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:11,630
To look for that man, she even went to the pawn shop in the back alley.

244
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:15,530
The next day she came back after spending a long time at Inwang Mountain.

245
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:19,300
Jin Seong's tomb is at Inwang Mountain.

246
00:29:19,300 --> 00:29:21,230
Then...

247
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:27,810
are you saying right now the reason why our Chae Gyeong is like that is related to Grand Prince Jin Seong?

248
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:30,640
The dead Grand Prince Jin Seong?

249
00:29:38,470 --> 00:29:40,590
How did it go?

250
00:29:40,590 --> 00:29:45,250
Your Highness, please listen carefully to what I say right now.

251
00:29:45,250 --> 00:29:49,770
This time, please act as if you don't know anything.

252
00:29:49,770 --> 00:29:53,810
This itself could become harmful to Your Highness and the crown prince as well.

253
00:29:53,810 --> 00:29:56,700
What do you mean by that, Orabeoni?

254
00:29:58,770 --> 00:30:01,030
He is not simply a thief.

255
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:05,560
Both the person Chae Gyeong is protecting and the person the King is searching for.

256
00:30:05,600 --> 00:30:11,400
And the Chief Royal Secretary's faction is so frantic over the matter — there is a single reason.

257
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,470
It is Grand Prince Jin Seong.

258
00:30:16,470 --> 00:30:18,400
How?

259
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:21,570
Didn't Grand Prince Jin Seong definitely die?

260
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:24,070
I even carried out his funeral with the Queen Dowager.

261
00:30:24,070 --> 00:30:27,650
Contrary to custom, she had him cremated.

262
00:30:27,650 --> 00:30:32,210
That's because the Queen Dowager is a devout Buddhist.

263
00:30:32,210 --> 00:30:39,230
She earnestly wished for the reincarnation of the son she had lost at an early age—

264
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:47,100
She tried to hide that it was a fake and cremated his body?

265
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:50,700
The grave keeper at Inwang Mountain checked and

266
00:30:50,700 --> 00:30:56,070
the Queen Dowager, apart from paying for ancestral rites, has never once privately gone to visit his grave.

267
00:30:56,070 --> 00:31:00,730
It was the Grand Prince's death anniversary not too long ago. However, she didn't visit his grave.

268
00:31:04,370 --> 00:31:08,710
Do you mean that even the First Vice Premier might have caught on that Yeok is alive?

269
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:11,430
That is so, Your Highness.

270
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:15,010
If the First Vice Premier's people all become aware of His Highness the Grand Prince's survival,

271
00:31:15,010 --> 00:31:17,700
it seems like it will only be a matter of time.

272
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:19,900
What is Yeok doing?

273
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:24,070
For the time being, the Snail Brides are watching over him.

274
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:27,780
"Snail Brides" is taken from a Korean fairy tale in which a farmer marries a beautiful woman who was once a snail.

275
00:31:27,780 --> 00:31:30,980
In this series they are apparently a gang of merchants performing good deeds.

276
00:31:44,330 --> 00:31:48,340
This is the pill I obtained after hearing about Yeok's death.

277
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:53,400
It is a poison that will take your life just by eating one pill.

278
00:31:54,860 --> 00:31:57,570
Convey this clearly to Yeok:

279
00:31:57,570 --> 00:32:00,460
If he sentimentalises about the past or his childhood and

280
00:32:00,460 --> 00:32:04,380
on the day he appears at the Royal Investigative Bureau to save that child,

281
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:08,530
I will eat this poison of my own free will.

282
00:32:09,890 --> 00:32:11,040
Your Highness.

283
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,390
They're not just words said to scare him.

284
00:32:13,390 --> 00:32:18,970
Rather than seeing my son die twice, I will die first!

285
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:31,510
It is a life that you saved.

286
00:32:31,510 --> 00:32:36,200
After the day Yeok's life was saved, his life did not belong to him alone.

287
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:42,170
You must not forget to remind him of this.

288
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:46,890
Yes, Your Highness.

289
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:14,710
Where is he?

290
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:18,000
Who are you?

291
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,900
Nak Cheon, it's me. It's me, Seok Hee.

292
00:34:24,690 --> 00:34:26,390
Where is Chae Gyeong?

293
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:41,340
What happened to her?

294
00:34:43,450 --> 00:34:47,300
She's being held right now at the Royal Investigative Bureau.

295
00:34:48,200 --> 00:34:50,540
For the crime of helping you escape.

296
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,520
Nak Cheon.

297
00:35:07,520 --> 00:35:10,100
Hey, block him. Block him.

298
00:35:10,100 --> 00:35:11,940
Nak Cheon.

299
00:35:17,010 --> 00:35:20,670
Fine, leave. But if you want to leave,

300
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:27,940
you would have to step on each one of us.

301
00:35:41,190 --> 00:35:43,660
♫ Suddenly the whole world  ♫

302
00:35:43,660 --> 00:35:46,650
What are you all standing still? Go after him!

303
00:35:46,650 --> 00:35:48,800
Ah, seriously! Nak Cheon!

304
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:55,350
♫ Suddenly there, without a sound  ♫

305
00:35:55,350 --> 00:35:59,570
♫ The first moment I saw you,  ♫

306
00:35:59,570 --> 00:36:04,330
♫ I was so nervous I couldn't bring myself to look at your eyes  ♫

307
00:36:04,330 --> 00:36:10,680
♫  What do I do now when my breath is about to stop?  ♫

308
00:36:14,790 --> 00:36:17,090
♫  The one whose brilliance chills my heart  ♫

309
00:36:17,090 --> 00:36:20,590
The Royal Investigative Bureau posted bulletins declaring that if he's not here by the Hour of the Rooster (5-7 PM) on the 30th

310
00:36:20,590 --> 00:36:23,170
you'll be paying for all the crimes.

311
00:36:23,170 --> 00:36:27,340
♫ You who might fly away when the wind blows ♫

312
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:30,230
Do you think he will come to save you?

313
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:34,520
♫ Your smile and tears,  ♫

314
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:38,960
♫ I fill my heart with them ♫

315
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,710
♫ Only loving you always  ♫

316
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:46,090
You shouldn't come.

317
00:36:46,860 --> 00:36:48,890
Don't come.

318
00:37:24,410 --> 00:37:26,990
Please hurry.

319
00:37:26,990 --> 00:37:30,830
Please open the gate.

320
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,970
I am passing through.

321
00:37:32,970 --> 00:37:36,120
I'm in a hurry.

322
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,800
Pass.

323
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,830
Hurry.

324
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:52,410
Let's go quickly.

325
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:00,390
Hurry. Hurry.

326
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:12,070
First Vice Premier, what happened?

327
00:38:12,070 --> 00:38:15,430
Is it true that you've teamed up with the thief who stole royal offerings?

328
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,550
Is it only your daughter who teamed up with him,

329
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:20,860
or is your whole family involved?

330
00:38:20,860 --> 00:38:22,650
Deputy Minister!

331
00:38:35,040 --> 00:38:38,930
Nothing has been proven yet.

332
00:38:38,930 --> 00:38:42,290
Please be more prudent.

333
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:46,130
Since he's saying such.

334
00:38:55,500 --> 00:38:59,850
His Majesty is not feeling well today,

335
00:38:59,850 --> 00:39:03,990
so he won't be able to attend the Court Session.

336
00:39:03,990 --> 00:39:06,630
You may all leave.

337
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:24,240
Don't worry too much.

338
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:29,690
Everything will be over once he shows up.

339
00:39:30,390 --> 00:39:35,690
Is the person Chief Royal Secretary is trying to catch really a thief?

340
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:38,430
He's not just a mere thief;

341
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:43,270
he's a traitor who stole His Majesty's property.

342
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:47,880
I guess he must be your sworn enemy

343
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:52,460
for you to recklessly go after him, even putting your life on the line.

344
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:55,590
Well, my life...

345
00:39:55,590 --> 00:39:58,080
If you haven't put your life on the line yet,

346
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:00,790
you will have to do so.

347
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,920
If you can't catch the thief after going this far,

348
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:09,690
I will hold you accountable for it.

349
00:40:15,300 --> 00:40:21,350
I guess you must prepare yourself to pay with your life soon, Chief Royal Secretary.

350
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:49,580
Are you stupid to lose him like that?

351
00:40:49,580 --> 00:40:52,490
Get lost right now if you can't do a proper job!

352
00:40:52,490 --> 00:40:56,930
I can see that you're angry, but you don't have the right to tell us to get lost.

353
00:40:56,930 --> 00:40:59,000
That's right. Yeok could do it.

354
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:05,760
I am the person who saved and brought Yeok... Orabeoni Nak Cheon.

355
00:41:06,610 --> 00:41:07,780
Have you forgotten about it?

356
00:41:15,050 --> 00:41:16,690
Water.

357
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:17,600
I will go get some.

358
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:19,370
No.

359
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:32,870
He was in a horrific state.

360
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:37,240
But with a resolve to somehow survive,

361
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,990
he was whistling.

362
00:41:43,550 --> 00:41:47,860
Just in case, I had to disguise his death.

363
00:41:47,860 --> 00:41:54,800
To find a corpse that resembled him, for many days, I had to visit villages suffering from the plague.

364
00:42:30,560 --> 00:42:35,990
It was only after sending the fake corpse to the palace

365
00:42:36,960 --> 00:42:40,100
that I was relieved.

366
00:42:40,100 --> 00:42:43,460
That's the life I helped him keep.

367
00:42:43,460 --> 00:42:48,030
But, do you want me to watch him put his life in danger for that girl?

368
00:42:48,030 --> 00:42:51,300
What about his dream of becoming a king?

369
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:59,700
You all have expectations for him!

370
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:06,490
For the new Joseon that he's going to make, we've given up our personal ambitions and dreams

371
00:43:06,490 --> 00:43:10,020
working at the pawn shop like this.

372
00:43:10,020 --> 00:43:12,000
I'll go find him immediately.

373
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:15,930
However, I am not trying to stop him.

374
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:18,950
I'm just searching for a safer method.

375
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,160
What happened?

376
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,980
I apologize, Your Majesty.

377
00:43:42,980 --> 00:43:46,740
There is still no news.

378
00:43:54,970 --> 00:43:59,610
Your Majesty! First Vice Premier Sin Soo Geun requests your presence!

379
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:02,320
Shouldn't you still be avoiding him?

380
00:44:02,320 --> 00:44:04,210
Let him in.

381
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,670
Your Majesty, this is the report from the Ministry of General Affairs & Personnel and the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce.

382
00:44:15,670 --> 00:44:17,780
It includes the update of relief rice you sent to the three southern provinces

383
00:44:17,780 --> 00:44:22,520
and the preparation for establishing the Relief Office.

384
00:44:28,090 --> 00:44:34,340
Is that all? I thought you were here to request clemency for Chae Gyeong.

385
00:44:34,350 --> 00:44:42,510
Just as I trust and treasure my child, Chae Gyeong, I also trust you, Your Majesty.

386
00:44:42,510 --> 00:44:47,600
Both my ignorant daughter, who refuses to utter a single word in her cell

387
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:51,100
and you, Your Majesty, who is ignoring her,

388
00:44:51,100 --> 00:44:55,040
I dare to presume that both of you

389
00:44:55,040 --> 00:45:01,290
have a reason you cannot speak of.

390
00:45:01,290 --> 00:45:05,050
Therefore, I cannot request you to just forgive her

391
00:45:05,050 --> 00:45:09,690
or release her.

392
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:13,500
If you could tell me what is troubling you,

393
00:45:13,500 --> 00:45:18,330
I will do my best to work through it with you.

394
00:45:18,330 --> 00:45:25,550
Before being your subject, I am your family.

395
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:35,860
You may leave now.

396
00:45:51,720 --> 00:45:52,890
Your Majesty!

397
00:45:52,890 --> 00:45:56,000
Exactly where are you hiding?

398
00:45:56,000 --> 00:46:01,160
Why do my people have to suffer because of him? Why?!

399
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,730
Your Majesty!

400
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,960
♫  You approached me silently  ♫

401
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:52,390
♫  You smiled at me while offering your hand  ♫

402
00:46:52,390 --> 00:46:56,830
♫  The time we spent together  ♫

403
00:46:56,830 --> 00:46:59,240
Your meal.

404
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:05,060
♫  is going far away like a dream  ♫

405
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:09,790
I think I've gone insane.
♫  I can't stand the longing now  ♫

406
00:47:10,630 --> 00:47:14,180
Although I know that you cannot come,
♫ which is growing so  ♫

407
00:47:14,180 --> 00:47:19,420
just in case, I turned around once more.
♫ Why didn't I know loving would be like that?  ♫

408
00:47:19,420 --> 00:47:23,720
How can I be so selfish?
♫ I can't do anything else ♫

409
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,900
♫  but leave even though I don't want to go  ♫

410
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:35,610
♫  I know now that I can't live without you  ♫

411
00:47:35,610 --> 00:47:42,430
♫  Don't go far away so we can meet again  ♫

412
00:47:42,430 --> 00:47:49,720
♫  I love you once again  ♫

413
00:47:49,730 --> 00:47:53,840
♫  The promise we shared  ♫

414
00:47:53,840 --> 00:48:00,660
♫  Is it time when I can no longer keep it?  ♫

415
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:10,490
♫  We know our destiny is inevitable  ♫

416
00:48:10,490 --> 00:48:15,580
♫  Please look back just once  ♫

417
00:48:15,580 --> 00:48:22,390
♫  Even if we're far apart, it's alright.
As long as we're under the same sky,  ♫

418
00:48:22,390 --> 00:48:30,070
♫  I'll be able to see you again one day  ♫

419
00:48:30,070 --> 00:48:36,980
♫  Even if I won't be able to see you again
if you turn away like this,  ♫

420
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:44,060
♫  I love you once again  ♫

421
00:48:44,060 --> 00:48:53,970
♫  Forever and ever, us  ♫

422
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,560
Y-Your Majesty!

423
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:15,270
Is this normal? How is it that every time I come to Hanyang, I meet you in the streets instead of the palace?

424
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:18,800
What is all of that on your face?

425
00:49:25,400 --> 00:49:30,890
Before being your subject, I am your family.

426
00:49:31,690 --> 00:49:33,400
Guard.

427
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:36,820
I'm here for your command.

428
00:49:36,820 --> 00:49:39,390
About Chae Gyeong, that child...

429
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:45,540
she resembles the First Vice Premier so much.

430
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:51,640
Therefore, that must be the reason both of them hurt me so much.

431
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:55,770
Pawn Shop

432
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:02,400
This is the poison Her Highness the Queen Dowager found after she heard the news that you died.

433
00:50:02,400 --> 00:50:06,650
Although she found this medicine with plans to follow you back then, this time—

434
00:50:06,650 --> 00:50:09,790
- What are you talking about?
- Do you think Her Highness the Queen Dowager is the only one?

435
00:50:09,790 --> 00:50:15,890
Me, all of your friends here, and all of the Snail Brides that are helping us, all of them will die. Do you know why?

436
00:50:15,960 --> 00:50:21,490
Because we're people who've decided to die before you and have sworn to protect you.

437
00:50:21,490 --> 00:50:25,320
Because you are our dream and hope.

438
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:31,070
You've endured it well. Now, you want to walk into the tiger's den?

439
00:50:31,070 --> 00:50:32,850
Even though you know it's a trap?

440
00:50:32,850 --> 00:50:37,950
Yeah, are you going to offer yourself up on a platter to the King because of one woman?

441
00:50:37,950 --> 00:50:42,190
Even if the heavens split, Sin Chae Gyeong won't die

442
00:50:43,130 --> 00:50:45,320
but you will die.

443
00:51:00,790 --> 00:51:03,590
Nak Cheon

444
00:51:03,590 --> 00:51:08,860
You endured it well. Now, you want to walk into the tiger's den?

445
00:51:08,860 --> 00:51:10,880
When you know it's a trap?

446
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:14,030
Exactly why did you do something so reckless?

447
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:17,570
You have to restrain yourself and wait for the right time.

448
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:33,260
When the sun rises, I will never utter your name again.

449
00:51:33,260 --> 00:51:38,830
I won't miss you nor will I wait for you.

450
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:48,130
The promise I made to wait for you is now invalid.

451
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:02,090
You promised, Sin Chae Gyeong.

452
00:52:33,190 --> 00:52:38,570
After the First Vice Premier's visit, His Majesty seems to have a lot on his mind.

453
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:44,070
What are you going to do if he plans to release that wench tomorrow?

454
00:52:44,070 --> 00:52:48,190
Before it's too late, you must decide.

455
00:52:49,790 --> 00:52:51,170
Decide?

456
00:52:51,170 --> 00:52:57,130
Even if we have to use that Sin wench more, make Grand Prince Jin Seong come.

457
00:52:58,380 --> 00:53:04,040
By any chance, are you being cautious of the First Vice Premier as well?

458
00:53:06,360 --> 00:53:11,680
You seem to be quite frustrated

459
00:53:11,700 --> 00:53:14,190
seeing as how you're speaking such nonsense.

460
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:17,490
We could lose our lives if something goes wrong.

461
00:53:21,330 --> 00:53:24,420
What about tying her up in front of the marketplace?

462
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:46,470
Are you alright?

463
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,910
How did you end up here?

464
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:10,430
If it's difficult for you to answer, you don't have to.

465
00:54:11,470 --> 00:54:15,190
I'm quite nosy, aren't I?

466
00:54:15,190 --> 00:54:19,010
I don't know where to start

467
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:26,510
because so many things happened.

468
00:54:27,270 --> 00:54:35,500
The life of a lowly girl like me with no one to depend on is all the same.

469
00:54:35,500 --> 00:54:40,030
I can either live a low (vulgar) life ( example as a prostitute) or a harsh life.

470
00:54:40,030 --> 00:54:45,160
I didn't want to live a vulgar life, so I chose to live a harsh life,

471
00:54:45,160 --> 00:54:51,110
and in doing so ... I ended up here.

472
00:54:59,530 --> 00:55:03,450
You have to be warm sometimes.

473
00:55:06,490 --> 00:55:09,040
Thank you.

474
00:55:12,800 --> 00:55:17,880
How can you smile at a time like this?

475
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:32,910
By any chance, have you heard anything about the thief who stole the royal offerings?

476
00:55:32,910 --> 00:55:35,980
He hasn't been caught, right?

477
00:55:40,840 --> 00:55:47,430
If you know something, you should tell them.

478
00:55:47,430 --> 00:55:51,650
If you remain like this, you'll die.

479
00:55:51,650 --> 00:55:53,210
Then...

480
00:55:56,340 --> 00:55:59,800
that person won't have to come all the way here.

481
00:56:12,430 --> 00:56:14,970
I said... I said I wouldn't wait.

482
00:56:16,220 --> 00:56:19,180
I will not wait.

483
00:56:19,180 --> 00:56:22,210
I won't wait.

484
00:56:22,210 --> 00:56:29,160
I can't allow him to die... to die because of me again.

485
00:56:40,950 --> 00:56:42,640
Pawn Shop

486
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:47,930
Due to the owner's personal circumstances, we are temporarily closing down. - Sincerely, the Owner.

487
00:56:56,020 --> 00:56:57,850
- Brother Nak Cheon.
- Shh!

488
00:56:57,850 --> 00:57:00,290
Be quiet.

489
00:57:00,330 --> 00:57:03,960
How to escape...

490
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:08,540
Yes, yes, yes, it's coming, woohoo!

491
00:57:08,540 --> 00:57:11,910
Again, one more round.

492
00:57:11,910 --> 00:57:12,770
Hey!

493
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:16,030
Are you really not going to do anything?

494
00:57:16,030 --> 00:57:19,060
Were you always such a coward filled with fear?

495
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,060
You didn't know?

496
00:57:20,060 --> 00:57:23,210
Yes, I've never once seen the cowardly side of you.

497
00:57:23,210 --> 00:57:24,990
From the moment we first met in the village

498
00:57:24,990 --> 00:57:28,710
when you shouted "I know the culprit" in front of all the village people

499
00:57:28,710 --> 00:57:32,650
to when you survived through hell and came to Namdo to find me,

500
00:57:32,650 --> 00:57:36,920
you were the bravest and coolest person in the world to me.

501
00:57:37,480 --> 00:57:42,250
I swore that I would die for you. I swore that I would live like you.

502
00:57:42,250 --> 00:57:46,920
Young Lady Chae Gyeong was the one who moved your heart, isn't she?

503
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:49,160
That's right.

504
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:52,220
- But—
- I ended up dead because of that.

505
00:57:56,220 --> 00:58:01,200
Yes, that's true, I regret everything.

506
00:58:02,420 --> 00:58:06,960
I regret meddling into your affairs back then. I regret listening to Chae Gyeong's words back then.

507
00:58:06,960 --> 00:58:13,730
I regret standing up to my older brother and dying as a traitor to this nation.

508
00:58:15,590 --> 00:58:17,780
Are you being sincere?

509
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:22,580
I'm sorry I became honest too late.

510
00:58:22,580 --> 00:58:23,910
Play!

511
00:58:23,910 --> 00:58:28,390
Then, it seems there's nothing for me to do here.

512
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:36,730
Seo No! Seo No!

513
00:58:41,680 --> 00:58:46,040
Hey, Seo No! Seo No, you bastard!

514
00:58:46,040 --> 00:58:48,380
You're going to regret this!

515
00:58:51,260 --> 00:58:54,610
The Madame has to be here to stop him.

516
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,280
Where did she go since earlier?

517
00:58:56,280 --> 00:58:59,680
I sent Seok Hee to pass the urgent message.

518
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:05,620
For the Snail Brides to lay low and stop coming to the pawn shop for the time being.

519
00:59:05,620 --> 00:59:09,810
Right. If Miss Sin were to talk,

520
00:59:09,810 --> 00:59:13,480
the first thing she would mention is the pawn shop.

521
00:59:17,020 --> 00:59:23,020
Of course, of course what I'm saying is, there's no way she would talk about it. Huh?

522
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:28,090
Is it more advantageous to survive as the black stone

523
00:59:29,260 --> 00:59:32,080
or the white stone?

524
00:59:33,580 --> 00:59:35,970
The white stone is better.

525
00:59:35,970 --> 00:59:40,060
It's the King and the King can do anything.

526
00:59:57,960 --> 00:59:59,360
Guard.

527
00:59:59,360 --> 01:00:00,690
Yes, Your Majesty.

528
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:03,670
Would you like a drink?

529
01:00:03,670 --> 01:00:07,160
I'm honored but I'm fine, Your Majesty.

530
01:00:07,160 --> 01:00:12,910
If Yeok, that bastard, is still alive, why is he not appearing in front of me?

531
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:16,530
Why is he hiding?

532
01:00:16,530 --> 01:00:20,570
Why is Chae Gyeong trying so hard to deceive me?

533
01:00:20,570 --> 01:00:23,790
Couldn't it be because he died as a traitor?

534
01:00:24,660 --> 01:00:27,370
It's been more than five years.

535
01:00:27,370 --> 01:00:30,930
It's plenty of time for him to request a pardon for his crimes.

536
01:00:30,930 --> 01:00:35,710
The fact that he doesn't show himself and commits these atrocious acts in secrecy

537
01:00:35,710 --> 01:00:42,010
means that Yeok, that bastard, suspects me and is avoiding me.

538
01:00:43,420 --> 01:00:46,160
He suspects that the person who killed him,

539
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:51,500
or at least the person who caused him to die is me.

540
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:56,450
Therefore, he wants to get revenge

541
01:00:56,450 --> 01:00:59,690
and take the throne for himself.

542
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:12,850
I wish it was just someone who resembles him.

543
01:01:13,650 --> 01:01:23,030
Or this time, I will truly have to kill him with my own hands.

544
01:01:51,030 --> 01:01:56,950
His Highness the Grand Prince must appear for this fight to end.

545
01:01:56,950 --> 01:01:58,860
Or...

546
01:01:58,860 --> 01:02:00,090
Or?

547
01:02:00,090 --> 01:02:06,120
Sin Chae Gyeong can disappear.

548
01:02:08,040 --> 01:02:15,290
What if we poison her and disguise it as if she committed suicide in her cell?

549
01:02:32,090 --> 01:02:36,890
Did you endure with this body?

550
01:02:36,890 --> 01:02:39,690
Don't come...

551
01:02:39,690 --> 01:02:42,520
You shouldn't come...

552
01:02:50,520 --> 01:02:56,520
Rather, you'll be thanking me

553
01:02:58,200 --> 01:03:03,280
because this medicine will end your suffering.
