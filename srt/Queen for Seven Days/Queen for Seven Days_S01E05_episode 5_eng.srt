1
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:47,880


2
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:09,690
Let's never see each other again. Farewell.

3
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,710
Please spare my life.  Spare me.

4
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,860
Hyungnim.

5
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:30,330
 Episode 5 

6
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:53,160
One, two!

7
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,820
Please take this.

8
00:01:55,820 --> 00:01:58,070
Where is he?

9
00:01:58,070 --> 00:02:00,840
Are you sure he's on this ship?

10
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,770
- That's him there! 
 - Be patient.

11
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,300
Hey, Young Master Nak Cheon.

12
00:02:19,150 --> 00:02:21,460
Welcome to Hanyang.

13
00:02:21,460 --> 00:02:25,300
I missed you, punk!

14
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:42,460
This face is... not his face.

15
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:48,610
They said he almost died. Maybe he was reincarnated. You are really rejuvenated.

16
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,830
Where is Nak Cheon?

17
00:03:00,110 --> 00:03:04,930
So you're the famous Seo No?

18
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:13,660
 Dong Jeok Jeon 

19
00:03:24,530 --> 00:03:27,860
- What? 
 - I didn't know it was this place. I didn't know. Please don't kill me.

20
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:31,220
Come with me. Come.

21
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:34,990
How dare you come here?

22
00:03:37,470 --> 00:03:43,090
Stop! Didn't you just see that bastard being dragged away? This is His Majesty's hunting ground.

23
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,010
You cannot come in without permission. Go back right now!

24
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:11,000
Will you disobey the royal command?

25
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:23,800
Goodness, how can you say such a scary thing?  Oh, these legs!

26
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,200
My legs are giving me trouble. I don't know why I came this way.

27
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,070
 This is the king's land? It belongs to you, Hyungnim? 

28
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:42,290
 I will tear your world to shreds. 

29
00:04:42,290 --> 00:04:47,140
 I will also take your throne. 

30
00:04:48,510 --> 00:04:50,360
 10th year of Yeon San's reign 

31
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:08,870
Your Majesty, we are missing the black hemp, amphibole, and a white, undecorated fan. 
    

32
00:05:13,180 --> 00:05:18,960
What happened? Didn't I ask you to have it ready by today?

33
00:05:20,870 --> 00:05:26,230
I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty. Since it's the monsoon season, 
    

34
00:05:26,230 --> 00:05:32,300
the ships transporting tributes have not arrived yet in Hanyang.

35
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:36,860
Then, keeping seasonal changes in mind, you should have prepared in advance.

36
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:42,600
Any earlier would be difficult. It's a busy farming season and the people are facing a difficult farming period.
   

37
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,930
Then, how about you all?

38
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:54,110
Is it farming season and are you facing farming difficulties as well?

39
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:10,830
Here, you wear this. I have worn this for too long.

40
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,450
Y-Your Majesty, please take back the royal command.

41
00:06:15,450 --> 00:06:20,530
I have been a little remiss with you lately.

42
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:24,770
Here is a gift so that we can get along again.

43
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:30,070
I heard your granddaughter is getting married next month.

44
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:34,000
Your kindness is overwhelming for remembering it.

45
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:41,260
Let's give this too.

46
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:43,370
Here, add it to the dowry.

47
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,350
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty!

48
00:06:45,350 --> 00:06:48,300
Immeasurable! Immeasurable!

49
00:06:48,300 --> 00:06:51,670
Don't just say it!

50
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,730
If you really think my grace is immeasurable, you should show sincerity as well!

51
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:02,010
Your Majesty.

52
00:07:10,270 --> 00:07:13,290
It seems like he's having a relapse.

53
00:07:13,290 --> 00:07:16,440
I wonder how long it will last this time.

54
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:21,140
Prime Minister, do you have any words for us? 
    

55
00:07:21,140 --> 00:07:28,080
I would like to hear your esteemed opinion on how to show our sincerity to satisfy His Majesty. 
   

56
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,930
He will be back to himself eventually... just like every other time.

57
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,850
Where is it?

58
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,680
Move aside, move.

59
00:07:54,680 --> 00:07:57,590
Move aside, move aside.

60
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,760
 Let me go! Won't you let me go, you wenches? Let go! 

61
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:23,170
 Let go, you wenches!!
    

62
00:08:56,930 --> 00:08:59,910
You will become the king of this nation.

63
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:03,800
You should always be neat.

64
00:09:15,330 --> 00:09:20,800
 Your Majesty's mother didn't die from disease. 
   

65
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,100
 She was killed, Your Majesty! 

66
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:37,660
Hurry, unnies.

67
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,330
Over here!

68
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:29,540
Over here!

69
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:34,430
My Lord! My Lord!

70
00:10:46,570 --> 00:10:48,760
♫  If I told you that I love you,  ♫

71
00:10:48,760 --> 00:10:50,730
It can't be. I must be mistaken.

72
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,980
♫  Would you tell me that you love me too?  ♫

73
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:56,400
Oh. 
 ♫  Baby, would you?  ♫

74
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:58,250
Y-Your Majesty.

75
00:10:58,250 --> 00:11:00,780
♫  If tomorrow I blew you a kiss, &nbsp;♫

76
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:04,090
♫  Would you say please give me some more of this? &nbsp;♫

77
00:11:04,090 --> 00:11:05,980
♫  Would you?  ♫

78
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:09,760
My Lord! My Lord!

79
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,940
♫  Every day when I open my eyes, &nbsp;♫

80
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:16,390
♫  It is you that I see in my mind. &nbsp;♫

81
00:11:16,390 --> 00:11:17,960
My Lord!

82
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:19,790
♫  It's you. &nbsp;♫

83
00:11:20,850 --> 00:11:26,200
♫  But I know that you'll never love me the way that I love you baby, baby &nbsp;♫

84
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,530
♫  No matter what I do &nbsp;♫

85
00:11:32,290 --> 00:11:37,540
♫  And baby you &nbsp;♫

86
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:43,190
♫  You are the light in my eyes &nbsp;♫

87
00:11:43,190 --> 00:11:47,330
My lord! My lord! 
 ♫  There's nothing that I wouldn't try &nbsp;♫

88
00:11:47,330 --> 00:11:54,360
♫  And I want to tell you so much that I just can't hide &nbsp;♫

89
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:58,080
♫  And I guess I'm right &nbsp;♫

90
00:11:58,080 --> 00:12:00,360
Y-Your Majesty.

91
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:03,460
Who are you? How do you know me?

92
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:08,240
I-It's me. Chae Gyeong, Your Majesty.

93
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:13,160
♫  But I know that you'll never love me the way that I love you baby, baby &nbsp;♫

94
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:17,830
♫  No matter how hard I try  ♫

95
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:27,470
Auntie, please give us 2 rice soups.

96
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:30,030
Come and have a seat.

97
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:47,490
Is this normal? Whenever I come to Hanyang, I meet Your Majesty on the streets and not the palace.

98
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:52,790
It's more likely that whenever I am incognito on the streets, you come to Hanyang.

99
00:12:52,790 --> 00:12:56,540
Oh my. What's all that on your face?

100
00:13:05,330 --> 00:13:08,690
Oh, this.

101
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:17,670
I am trying to spread a rumor that I am ugly. I don't want to get married.

102
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:23,530
Without having to try so hard, you have a face that will take you a long time to get married.

103
00:13:23,530 --> 00:13:26,880
When I have such a face, how come you didn't recognize me at first glance?

104
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:29,640
Because you are way too ugly.

105
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:38,010
I understand. Since you adore me that much, I will escort you well today.

106
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,090
Do you know what my plans are?

107
00:13:40,090 --> 00:13:43,740
How wouldn't I know? I know it all. Do you want to bet on it?

108
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:47,200
You will have to wager your life.

109
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,550
Would I try if I wasn't prepared to do that?

110
00:13:51,550 --> 00:13:56,620
As you wish. In return, don't call me "Hyungnim." (  "Older Brother" usually said by younger brother). 

111
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,560
Let's go together, Orabeoni.   ("Older brother" term for younger sisters). 

112
00:14:23,830 --> 00:14:27,360
♫  You approached silently  ♫

113
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:30,790
 It's been so long since he got scolded by Her Highness the Queen Dowager, yet he's still not over it?  

114
00:14:30,790 --> 00:14:34,860
 If you keep acting up, I won't give you this. 

115
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:37,270
 That's- 

116
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,770
 If you hurt someone, you should apologize. 

117
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:45,360
 Are all men in Hanyang like you, Young Master? 

118
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:49,880
Tuna, squid, dried yellow corvina.

119
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:52,630
Hey Miss, buy some dried yellow corvina.

120
00:14:52,630 --> 00:14:58,930
♫  I can't stand the longing now which is growing so  ♫

121
00:14:58,930 --> 00:15:04,070
Alright, Miss. Two nyang.

122
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:07,160
What kind of rice cake do you like? Honey-filled rice cake?

123
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:12,590
  ♫ Even though I don't want to go, I must  leave ♫ 

124
00:15:12,590 --> 00:15:18,460
Where do you see it scratched? Where is the scratch?
♫  I know now that I can't live without you  ♫

125
00:15:18,460 --> 00:15:20,240
Just give me this for free.

126
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:25,410
Just leave, I used to sell this for three nyang.
♫  Don't go away.  ♫

127
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:27,330
♫  I won't be able to see you again.  ♫

128
00:15:27,330 --> 00:15:32,060
  Hurry, hurry.  
♫  I love you once again  ♫

129
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:35,570
 Stop right there! 

130
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:41,040
I will give it to you for cheap price. One nyang five poon.

131
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:56,570
Oh, should we buy some jujubes as well?

132
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:59,550
This looks like your face.

133
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,580
What's the matter?

134
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:22,400
I was wondering if there are gold specks on your face.

135
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:32,500
Why are you being like this?

136
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,280
Just because, I tried copying you.

137
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,230
Excuse me, is it true that you will trade for a sack of rice?

138
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:55,530
But what can I trade for rice?

139
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,200
I brought a set of brass utensils.

140
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,930
We don't need things like brass.

141
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:03,860
We only deal with information.

142
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,530
First, tell me your name and affiliation.

143
00:17:06,530 --> 00:17:12,060
What we need depends on the person. As does the amount of rice we exchange.

144
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:15,630
Me. I just work as a servant for a noble family.

145
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,930
Oh, it's a very desirable position.

146
00:17:18,930 --> 00:17:22,590
Here. Come on in.

147
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,520
Come in.

148
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:32,320
That way.

149
00:18:01,910 --> 00:18:03,090
Oh!

150
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:08,340
From which noble family? What work do you do there? 
    

151
00:18:11,630 --> 00:18:14,940
Well, I am a servant at Scholar Yoon's household.

152
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:18,270
All right, Yoon's.

153
00:18:23,030 --> 00:18:26,200
My Lord, My Lord. It's this simple?

154
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:28,420
Then should I complicate things?

155
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:31,150
No, I am just thankful.

156
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:34,970
Here, my Lord.

157
00:18:34,970 --> 00:18:36,830
Thank you for the useful information.

158
00:18:36,830 --> 00:18:40,200
I will bring all the servants from this neighborhood.

159
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:42,810
Thank you. Thank you.

160
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:47,390
Wait outside.

161
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:58,570
Oh, I am going.

162
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:10,880
Could you, could you be the person who was supposed to come today?

163
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:14,900
I think so too. She's pretty.

164
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,870
Yes, I should have introduced myself earlier. I'm—

165
00:19:18,870 --> 00:19:22,540
Let's do the introductions inside.

166
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:25,980
There might be customers coming.

167
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,900
How did she know about that place?

168
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,540
I don't know.

169
00:19:59,570 --> 00:20:01,480
Who are you?

170
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:26,870
She's acting like she's the mistress of the house.

171
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:38,170
Young Lady. I have long heard about you but since this is our first time meeting in person,

172
00:20:38,170 --> 00:20:41,560
let's keep our manners.

173
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:47,070
I don't understand why every single Joseon scholar quibbles over manners.

174
00:20:47,970 --> 00:20:51,170
Don't you know who I am?

175
00:20:51,170 --> 00:20:52,560
I never expected you to be this pretty...

176
00:20:52,560 --> 00:20:56,580
This headstrong...

177
00:20:56,580 --> 00:20:58,670
I never expected that.

178
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,870
I am Seo No.

179
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,310
Oh my.

180
00:21:12,310 --> 00:21:13,490
Look here.

181
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,590
This was what I was owed.

182
00:21:15,590 --> 00:21:18,940
Orabeoni Nak Cheon almost died because of him.

183
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:23,320
One would rather wish for death than the hell he experienced.

184
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:27,510
This slap is nothing in comparison.

185
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:33,580
You have to pay back your debt even in death.

186
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:39,600
I will keep that in mind.

187
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:49,540
Well, greetings are done with now.

188
00:21:49,540 --> 00:21:52,330
I have introduced myself.

189
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:58,130
However, where is Orabeoni Nak Cheon?

190
00:22:24,590 --> 00:22:27,710
 Royal command? It's a royal command? 

191
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,350
 I will no longer follow Hyungnim's Joseon. 

192
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:27,250
Auntie, please give me two rice soups.

193
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,830
We are closed for business today.

194
00:23:29,830 --> 00:23:31,150
Let's go to another place.

195
00:23:31,150 --> 00:23:34,950
You have full access to the kitchen, but don't break things.

196
00:23:34,950 --> 00:23:36,940
I understand.

197
00:23:43,500 --> 00:23:45,320
Orabeoni.

198
00:24:06,060 --> 00:24:10,100
It reminds me of our first meeting.

199
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:13,380
Can I trust this tavern owner?

200
00:24:16,220 --> 00:24:21,230
So what if she's a robber? I will save you again and ask for another wish.

201
00:24:58,490 --> 00:25:01,490
Wow, you're strong!

202
00:25:17,860 --> 00:25:20,900
Orabeoni, please open the door.

203
00:26:42,510 --> 00:26:46,060
 Memorial Tablet of the Deposed Lady Yoon 

204
00:27:21,400 --> 00:27:24,270
If it's Your Majesty's mother,

205
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:27,840
she's also like a mother to me.

206
00:27:41,670 --> 00:27:47,450
 Memorial Tablet of the Grand Prince Jin Seong Lee Yeok 

207
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,740
Like my mother's death wasn't my fault,

208
00:28:43,540 --> 00:28:46,420
Yeok's death wasn't your fault either.

209
00:28:50,610 --> 00:28:54,970
If you want to blame yourself, resent him instead

210
00:28:54,970 --> 00:28:57,510
for leaving at such a young age.

211
00:28:58,230 --> 00:29:03,570
Why he left you behind.

212
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:19,630
So, do you resent her?

213
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:32,920
You just miss her.

214
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:40,630
You heard him.

215
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:46,800
His Majesty misses his mother.

216
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:49,470
Yeok,

217
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:58,590
Chae Gyeong misses you.

218
00:30:15,740 --> 00:30:17,860
It worked out well.

219
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:21,880
What we are embarrassed to say out loud, we said to each other instead.

220
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:25,520
It's nice to have a family. Don't you think so?

221
00:30:27,500 --> 00:30:29,460
To me, family is...

222
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:33,850
just a ball of fire.

223
00:30:33,850 --> 00:30:36,420
I can't swallow it nor spit it out.

224
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:39,640
It torments me persistently.

225
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:42,900
I was running away from them my whole life,

226
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:48,560
and look at me now. Barely performing memorial rites in hiding.

227
00:30:53,090 --> 00:30:56,500
You can become a good and wise king.

228
00:30:58,150 --> 00:31:00,100
A good and wise king?

229
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,030
Yes.

230
00:31:02,570 --> 00:31:05,190
If you become a good and wise king,

231
00:31:05,190 --> 00:31:10,070
you will be confident in front of the late king's grave.

232
00:31:10,070 --> 00:31:15,210
One day, in front of all the civil and military officials of the court, with your mother's memorial tablet for all to see,

233
00:31:15,210 --> 00:31:18,560
you'll be able to perform memorial rites.

234
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:24,580
The late Grand Prince will also be proud of Your Majesty.

235
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:38,820
Do you remember?

236
00:31:40,710 --> 00:31:42,870
- This is— 
 - Yes.

237
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:46,360
The Grand Prince bought it as a gift for you.

238
00:31:46,360 --> 00:31:51,540
This salamander is the king of ditches. He reigns over the rain.

239
00:31:51,540 --> 00:31:56,820
However, this salamander has lost its mind. So three southern provinces are flooded...

240
00:32:01,960 --> 00:32:05,300
Don't just smile. Show your power.

241
00:32:05,300 --> 00:32:09,490
If you want to become a good and wise king, you have to master the heaven first.

242
00:32:18,190 --> 00:32:19,990
Aren't I right?

243
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,840
Grand Prince.

244
00:32:58,040 --> 00:32:59,730
Your Highness the Grand Prince.

245
00:33:11,870 --> 00:33:13,770
You're not.

246
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:20,880
You're not a ghost; you're a person.

247
00:33:24,830 --> 00:33:26,680
I thought.

248
00:33:33,430 --> 00:33:35,280
Oh, wait...

249
00:33:41,160 --> 00:33:43,350
- By chance— 
 - No.

250
00:33:44,930 --> 00:33:48,210
How can you say no right away when I haven't asked the question?

251
00:33:56,340 --> 00:33:58,270
Did you have dinner?

252
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:03,380
Food served at the memorial rite is supposed to be shared.

253
00:34:07,910 --> 00:34:14,260
  Can you not go? Can you not go?  

254
00:34:41,420 --> 00:34:44,480
It's alright. Please eat.

255
00:34:56,430 --> 00:35:00,150
Today is the death anniversary of someone precious to me.

256
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:28,870
You look like him.

257
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:42,620
Even as a ghost, can't he come see me once?

258
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:49,990
Even if you're a ghost, I won't be scared. If you're here, can you talk to me?

259
00:35:49,990 --> 00:35:52,530
Can you at least make a sound?

260
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,290
Don't mock the deceased.

261
00:35:57,080 --> 00:36:02,470
I don't think the person died so you could play the reminiscing game.

262
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,600
How can you put it that way?

263
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,900
Reminiscing game? Mock?

264
00:36:11,900 --> 00:36:13,620
What do you know?

265
00:36:13,620 --> 00:36:16,160
Then, what do  you  know?

266
00:36:16,160 --> 00:36:20,380
The mind of the deceased? His pain? His suffering?

267
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,600
What exactly do you know?

268
00:36:30,820 --> 00:36:32,640
What's going on?

269
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,610
Wife.

270
00:36:45,860 --> 00:36:48,790
Be loyal to your new lover.

271
00:37:05,810 --> 00:37:10,520
Don't be undignified and socialize with anyone.

272
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:15,380
Still, if you call me "wife" all of a sudden, how will I marry?

273
00:37:15,380 --> 00:37:18,370
Just a couple hours ago, you said you didn't want to get married.

274
00:37:18,370 --> 00:37:22,800
There is a huge difference between refusing to marry and being unable to marry.

275
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,140
Are you finished with the meal?

276
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:29,710
I can't eat this. I get sick if I do.

277
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:34,940
You too?

278
00:37:37,850 --> 00:37:41,470
Is there another person who can't eat this?

279
00:37:42,740 --> 00:37:44,770
Let's see.

280
00:37:46,850 --> 00:37:51,930
Yeok didn't eat this saying that he was copying me.

♫  I can't stand the longing now which is growing so  ♫

286

Orabeoni Nak Cheon?

287
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,530
Myeong Hye.

288
00:38:42,530 --> 00:38:44,060
Why? Are you being followed?

289
00:38:44,060 --> 00:38:46,900
♫  Why didn't I know loving would be that?  ♫

290

No, it's just...

291
00:38:49,910 --> 00:38:52,660
I guess it has become a habit.

 Pawn shop 

300
00:39:24,730 --> 00:39:28,600
For the 5 brothers who have finally come together. Cheers!

301
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,640
Cheers.

302
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:33,360
Who says five brothers?

303
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:37,770
Our social status, gender, and personality are all different.

304
00:39:37,770 --> 00:39:39,720
View it with your heart. Your heart.

305
00:39:39,720 --> 00:39:41,380
Does your heart have eyes?

306
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:45,950
Treat these two black things as eyes.

307
00:39:46,700 --> 00:39:48,850
Mine are rosy pink.

308
00:39:48,850 --> 00:39:51,970
Gwang Oh, you don't look it.

309
00:39:51,970 --> 00:39:54,310
But if you think about it, he's actually a perverted scholar.

310
00:39:54,310 --> 00:39:59,490
Hey, give back all the erotic picture books you took from me. Where are they? Are they here?

311
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:03,590
Guys, guys. Stop it and drink.

312
00:40:07,190 --> 00:40:09,250
Ah, this is nice.

313
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:11,170
What happened to your hand?

314
00:40:14,460 --> 00:40:16,620
Oh, it's nothing.

315
00:40:17,550 --> 00:40:19,220
Give me your hand.

316
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:34,870
Don't forget.

317
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:39,910
Your body belongs to me.

318
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:46,660
You're my savior, not my master.

319
00:40:46,660 --> 00:40:48,730
Let's have another cup.

320
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,880
Chae Gyeong!

321
00:41:08,260 --> 00:41:13,230
You! Where have you been till now?

322
00:41:13,230 --> 00:41:16,520
What did you do by yourself after leaving the nanny behind?

323
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,520
Mother.

324
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:21,980
I thought something happened to you.

325
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,640
What would happen to me?

326
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,370
You always create trouble at this time of the year. Of course, your mother would be worried.

327
00:41:33,990 --> 00:41:36,240
I am sorry.

328
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:38,630
It's fine if you're all right.

329
00:41:40,970 --> 00:41:43,200
Father.

330
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,430
You didn't run into any trouble?

331
00:41:48,810 --> 00:41:50,770
Then, it's fine.

332
00:41:58,030 --> 00:41:59,270
Give me the broom!

333
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:01,720
Oh, my. Ma'am. Ma'am. I will take good care of it.

334
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:03,230
Oh my goodness! Come here!

335
00:42:03,230 --> 00:42:06,730
Get her quickly! Goodness!

336
00:42:06,730 --> 00:42:10,630
Ma'am! Ma'am! Just a moment!

337
00:42:11,660 --> 00:42:16,120
It's all fine. But if you're going somewhere, please go with me.

338
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:19,920
Whenever you're like this, I feel like I will die earlier than my allotted lifespan.

339
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,940
I wonder if I became a nanny to go through this.

340
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,990
What is that?

341
00:42:28,090 --> 00:42:30,600
A trace the ghost left behind.

342
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,520
Ghost?

343
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,050
Yeah.

344
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,660
I decided to believe in ghosts.

345
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,590
If not, it can't be explained.

346
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,860
This...

347
00:42:49,720 --> 00:42:51,800
and this as well.

348
00:42:57,580 --> 00:43:00,260
Here. Can you feel it?

349
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:08,860
Yes. Young Miss, before it's too late,

350
00:43:08,860 --> 00:43:12,150
hurry and get married. When you get older, this is the first place to sag.

351
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:15,450
- What happened to your chest? Where did it go? 
 - Nanny!

352
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:18,590
You have a while to go.

353
00:43:18,590 --> 00:43:21,850
Where are you going now?

354
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,690
She's undignified. Seriously.

355
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:31,870
I am still in my prime.

356
00:43:55,100 --> 00:43:59,490
  Yeok didn't eat this saying he was copying me.  

357
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:32,440
  He should have died already.  

358
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:38,600
  What a fighter. Exactly what do you feel so wronged about 

359
00:44:38,600 --> 00:44:43,250
  that you would clench your fist and endure? 

360
00:44:43,250 --> 00:44:48,800
  Just leave. Resentment and blame are all futile.  

361
00:44:52,450 --> 00:44:56,640
  I... I can't leave. 

362
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,740
  Save... please just save me. 

363
00:45:00,740 --> 00:45:04,540
  I'll survive and... King... 

364
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:07,630
  I'll... 

365
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,720
  become king. 

366
00:45:11,950 --> 00:45:14,390
  I'll become king. 

367
00:45:33,140 --> 00:45:36,680
Orabeoni! Orabeoni!

368
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:47,700
I can't breathe!

369
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:56,530
My cane! Cane!

370
00:45:56,530 --> 00:45:58,430
 Nak Cheon 

371
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:16,720
  I can't walk. 

372
00:46:17,570 --> 00:46:20,630
I can't feel my legs.

373
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:30,610
I can't walk. I can't feel my legs. I can't walk...

374
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:50,170
No, no!

375
00:46:50,170 --> 00:46:54,060
No! I won't die! I won't die!

376
00:47:11,160 --> 00:47:13,250
Please save me...

377
00:47:14,200 --> 00:47:16,760
Please save me, Chae Gyeong!

378
00:47:25,960 --> 00:47:29,180
I'll definitely return. No matter what.

379
00:47:30,070 --> 00:47:32,070
Just wait.

380
00:47:33,650 --> 00:47:35,870
Just wait, Chae Gyeong.

381
00:47:58,870 --> 00:48:02,050
I want to know about Sin Chae Gyeong.

382
00:48:04,380 --> 00:48:07,310
And, after tonight,

383
00:48:09,390 --> 00:48:14,800
I never want to hear her name again.

384
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:20,800
It's not difficult for me to tell you.

385
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:26,960
However, it'll be hard for him to erase Young Lady Chae Gyeong completely.

386
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:35,080
I know that you healed his wounds, allowed him to walk again, and saved his life,

387
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:41,690
but he wouldn't have survived just due to your care, My Lady Myeong.

388
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:46,070
There must have been a deeper and a more desperate reason.

389
00:48:46,070 --> 00:48:51,630
Nonsense. The power that allows people to survive is ambition

390
00:48:51,630 --> 00:48:55,030
and the power that saved him was his will for revenge against the King.

391
00:48:55,930 --> 00:49:01,400
Love or the heart, don't think of shaking  up my orabeoni with those innocent words.

392
00:49:01,400 --> 00:49:03,900
If you do,

393
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:08,330
you'll die by my hand.

394
00:49:21,860 --> 00:49:24,090
It was these men?

395
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:29,780
I don't know where they came from but only a few of my men and I were able to swim to save ourselves.

396
00:49:29,780 --> 00:49:32,630
and they took all of the items.

397
00:49:35,520 --> 00:49:37,430
I'll give you 10 days.

398
00:49:37,430 --> 00:49:41,500
Whether it's the stolen objects or their heads, bring it to me.

399
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:47,560
If you fail, both you and your family members will have to give up your heads in 10 days' time.

400
00:49:55,060 --> 00:49:57,100
Understood.

401
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:21,000
Request His Majesty the King to deliver a message.

402
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:24,340
Are you planning to collect royal offerings again?

403
00:50:24,340 --> 00:50:29,560
His Majesty's coffers aren't full.

404
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:32,990
You also need a new hairpin,

405
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:40,270
so there's no other choice but to request him to order offerings from Gyeongsang-do, Jeolla-do, and even Tamra.

406
00:50:40,270 --> 00:50:46,860
By the way, I'm worried about the food to be used for my grandson's first birthday celebration.

407
00:51:19,270 --> 00:51:22,460
Your Majesty, I heard from the Chief Royal Secretary earlier—

408
00:51:22,460 --> 00:51:26,940
Three southern provinces are suffering from serious flood damage?

409
00:51:26,940 --> 00:51:33,110
Yes, the ship that carried the royal offerings meant for you also sank.

410
00:51:33,110 --> 00:51:34,970
I think you should send out another message—

411
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:38,240
Do you know why the flood occurred?

412
00:51:40,710 --> 00:51:45,860
Everyone is saying the Salamander lost his mind.

413
00:51:48,400 --> 00:51:51,570
I must host a council meeting tomorrow.

414
00:51:57,630 --> 00:52:00,210
  When you become a good and wise king, 

415
00:52:00,210 --> 00:52:05,150
  you'll be confident even in front of the late King's tomb. 

416
00:52:05,150 --> 00:52:07,790
 One day, in front of all the civil and military officials of the court, 

417
00:52:07,790 --> 00:52:13,920
 with your mother's memorial tablet for all to see, you'll be able to perform memorial rites. 

418
00:52:18,490 --> 00:52:22,760
We greet Your Majesty.

419
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:32,870
Bow to the King four times.

420
00:52:34,580 --> 00:52:42,870
Bow. Rise. Bow. Rise.

421
00:52:44,770 --> 00:52:49,940
Cabinet members, start giving your reports.

422
00:52:51,330 --> 00:52:54,640
The Royal Investigative Bureau reporting.

423
00:52:54,640 --> 00:52:56,200
  Extent of flood damage in three southern provinces  

424
00:52:56,200 --> 00:53:00,420
 - is unprecedented, please send  
 - Minister Seong.

425
00:53:00,420 --> 00:53:04,800
 - a royal inspector to help relieve the people's suffering.  
 - I came unprepared because he's suddenly holding a court session.

426
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,970
Were you able to prepare something to demonstrate your sincerity?

427
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:08,590
I didn't have enough time.

428
00:53:08,590 --> 00:53:11,070
Ministers.

429
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:30,640
Due to the flood in Gyeongsang-do, the stored food supply has decreased and citizens were injured.

430
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:37,410
I heard 400 houses were buried in the sand or floated away in the flood.

431
00:53:37,410 --> 00:53:43,850
Please record the number of people who died from being crushed to death or drowning and the number of houses lost in the flood in detail.

432
00:53:43,850 --> 00:53:47,520
Take proper measures to ensure the citizens don't encounter any more difficulties.

433
00:53:47,520 --> 00:53:53,040
Your Majesty's grace knows no bound.

434
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:57,520
Minister Seong, why is His Majesty being like this suddenly?

435
00:54:00,940 --> 00:54:04,470
- Thank you for working hard in this heat. 
 - I am honored.

436
00:54:17,470 --> 00:54:21,570
Exactly why is he doing something he's never done?!

437
00:54:21,570 --> 00:54:25,440
The majority of the ministers looked taken aback as well.

438
00:54:25,440 --> 00:54:31,420
These past couple of months, he was busy going out of the palace. He never paid any attention to state affairs.

439
00:54:31,420 --> 00:54:33,280
Your Highness. 
    

440
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:34,450
What is it?

441
00:54:34,450 --> 00:54:39,350
Capital Defense Assistant Commander's niece, Young Lady Yoon, would like to see you.

442
00:54:39,350 --> 00:54:42,540
It seems Myeong Hye is here, Your Highness.

443
00:54:43,380 --> 00:54:45,700
Let her in.

444
00:54:52,480 --> 00:54:54,910
My future daughter-in-law is here?

445
00:54:54,910 --> 00:54:58,470
Greetings, Your Highness. 
    

446
00:55:14,410 --> 00:55:18,240
Is Yeok doing well? He's not sick?

447
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:22,040
Yes, he's fine.

448
00:55:22,040 --> 00:55:26,950
Then why did Yeok send you to the palace? He always made sure you were cautious.

449
00:55:26,950 --> 00:55:31,040
When the Grand Prince rode the government ship to travel from the three southern provinces,

450
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:34,180
that ship was carrying royal offerings and bribes

451
00:55:34,180 --> 00:55:36,970
for the King, Chief Royal Secretary, and Royal Concubine Jang.

452
00:55:36,970 --> 00:55:39,990
Therefore, he stole the items

453
00:55:39,990 --> 00:55:43,290
and asked me to monitor the Chief Royal Secretary's side's movements.

454
00:55:43,290 --> 00:55:46,700
Is it a good idea to get involved with the Chief Royal Secretary's faction as soon as he's back?

455
00:55:46,700 --> 00:55:48,940
Don't worry too much, Your Highness.

456
00:55:48,940 --> 00:55:52,870
Most of the goods are bribes from the provincial officials,

457
00:55:52,870 --> 00:55:56,460
so the Chief Royal Secretary's side won't be able to publicly investigate the case.

458
00:55:56,460 --> 00:56:00,140
Since the king has even deployed the Royal Inspector to relieve flood damage in three southern provinces,

459
00:56:00,140 --> 00:56:03,780
it seems they won't be able to avoid the interest in the stolen royal offerings.

460
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:06,190
Royal Inspector to the three southern provinces?

461
00:56:06,970 --> 00:56:12,580
I don't know what has gotten into him all of a sudden. He's trying to play the good and wise king.

462
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:25,020
  Hyungnim, you're quite respectable. 

463
00:56:25,020 --> 00:56:28,470
  Mapo, Gwacheon, Pocheon, Gimpo... 

464
00:56:28,470 --> 00:56:33,280
  Goodness, half of all of Gyeonggi's land belongs to you. 

465
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:38,910
  You took control of all bodies of water and even banned people from fishing.  

466
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:42,140
  And why do you visit the gisaeng houses so often? 

467
00:56:45,810 --> 00:56:49,090
  What's going on, Wife? 

468
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,590
  Tavern at 3-way intersection, 

469
00:56:57,500 --> 00:57:00,480
  the King and Sin Chae Gyeong. 

470
00:57:06,730 --> 00:57:09,050
- Is this the place? 
 - Yes.

471
00:57:10,060 --> 00:57:15,040
According to what that tavern owner said yesterday, they'll give you a bag of rice for information.

472
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,830
Then, that means they should have valuable information.

473
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:22,590
No matter how much information they know, you can't expect them to know a ghost.

474
00:57:22,590 --> 00:57:27,000
I can just ask them then. Nanny, wait here.

475
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:28,580
Goodness, I don't know anymore!

476
00:57:28,580 --> 00:57:36,120
Young Lady! Use it if a ghost pops out. Ba-ba-ba bam! It's adzuki beans.

477
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:44,390
I heard that you'll hand out rice for information.

478
00:57:44,390 --> 00:57:47,710
Then, you'll hand me information for rice, right?

479
00:57:47,710 --> 00:57:49,490
Pardon?

480
00:57:51,970 --> 00:57:54,990
There's something I must figure out! Please just let me meet the owner first!

481
00:57:54,990 --> 00:57:56,830
The owner isn't in right now!

482
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,930
- No. 
 - I will come out after just asking a single question.

483
00:57:59,000 --> 00:58:01,400
I said you can't! Hey, stop!

484
00:58:10,530 --> 00:58:14,360
What are you doing?!

485
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:19,570
Fine, fine, I won't peek.

486
00:58:20,670 --> 00:58:24,130
First, sit down. I have much to talk about.

487
00:58:29,710 --> 00:58:35,530
Are you the owner of this pawn shop?

488
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:39,130
Yes, I am.

489
00:58:39,130 --> 00:58:44,740
Is it true that you know everything that goes on in the capital?

490
00:58:44,740 --> 00:58:46,840
What are you curious about?

491
00:58:49,810 --> 00:58:56,200
By any chance, can you find a ghost too?

492
00:58:56,200 --> 00:58:57,330
A ghost?

493
00:58:57,330 --> 00:59:02,750
I don't mind if he's a ghost now. Can't you find him for me? No, a person.

494
00:59:02,750 --> 00:59:03,950
A person?

495
00:59:03,950 --> 00:59:06,460
No, a ghost!

496
00:59:06,460 --> 00:59:11,020
Are you looking for a person or a ghost? Pick one.

497
00:59:11,020 --> 00:59:12,830
How can I pick just one?

498
00:59:12,830 --> 00:59:17,990
I don't even know if I've fallen for a person or a ghost.

499
00:59:19,260 --> 00:59:24,050
Would a person who's been bewitched by a ghost be able to differentiate between the living and the dead?

500
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:28,770
  She's looking for me. 

501
00:59:30,960 --> 00:59:35,060
Anyway, you're looking for a man.

502
00:59:35,060 --> 00:59:39,620
Yes, it's a relief. That's what I also think.

503
00:59:39,620 --> 00:59:44,210
I think that it's a relief the ghost came to me using a man's body.

504
00:59:45,460 --> 00:59:47,220
Did you just laugh?

505
00:59:47,220 --> 00:59:51,660
N-no, I didn't laugh. My breathing is just loud.

506
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:54,210
Continue.

507
00:59:55,110 --> 01:00:00,330
So, what happened is...

508
01:00:00,330 --> 01:00:05,720
you know the tavern located on the 3-way intersection in the marketplace, right? A few days ago,

509
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:11,100
I happened to go there and met a man coming out of the next room,

510
01:00:11,100 --> 01:00:17,480
but h-he looked exactly like my f-friend who died from an accident when I was young!

511
01:00:17,480 --> 01:00:22,040
His eyes, mouth, v-voice, and even habits were the same!

512
01:00:22,040 --> 01:00:23,970
Of course, I have never seen my friend as an adult,

513
01:00:23,970 --> 01:00:28,170
but he looks exactly like how I imagined him to be—

514
01:00:29,890 --> 01:00:32,910
Are you listening to me right now?

515
01:00:32,910 --> 01:00:34,590
Look here, pimp!

516
01:00:34,590 --> 01:00:36,890
Pimp? How can you call me a "pimp"? How do I look like a pimp?!

517
01:00:36,890 --> 01:00:39,870
If you're the pawn shop owner, it's "pimp"—

518
01:00:39,870 --> 01:00:41,620
Wait a minute.

519
01:00:46,750 --> 01:00:53,920


520
01:01:01,600 --> 01:01:03,560
You!

521
01:01:25,460 --> 01:01:28,230
It's happening again.

522
01:01:33,070 --> 01:01:35,460
Don't listen. You can't.

523
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:57,300
What are you doing right now? Leave right now.

524
01:01:57,300 --> 01:01:59,060
Why are you causing a fuss after coming all the way here?

525
01:01:59,060 --> 01:02:00,890
I told you everything earlier.

526
01:02:00,890 --> 01:02:07,420
I... a ghost... you bewitched me.

527
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:12,370
That's none of my business. Get lost right now.

528
01:02:12,370 --> 01:02:17,180
Then why do you resemble him? Out of all people, why do you resemble him?

529
01:02:17,180 --> 01:02:21,080
You, exactly who are you?

530
01:02:26,090 --> 01:02:27,880
You're His Highness the Grand Prince, aren't you?

531
01:02:27,880 --> 01:02:29,120
No.

532
01:02:29,120 --> 01:02:34,350
If you're not him, then why do you keep catching my eye?

533
01:02:34,350 --> 01:02:37,690
Why do you keep making my heart pound?

534
01:02:39,420 --> 01:02:43,920
Is that my fault? It's your fault for being easy and indecent.

535
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:46,970
A woman with a husband comes here to find another man?

536
01:02:46,970 --> 01:02:50,800
You embrace him and talk about whether your heart is pounding or not while flirting with any man!

537
01:02:50,800 --> 01:02:52,100
- Go!
- Ouch!

538
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:55,800
Leave! Leave! You are a ghost!

539
01:02:55,800 --> 01:02:57,610
If you're human, you can't do this.

540
01:02:57,610 --> 01:03:00,750
You are a ghost! Disappear, leave immediately!

541
01:03:00,750 --> 01:03:02,690
What are you doing?!

542
01:03:07,690 --> 01:03:10,280
Is this what you wanted?

543
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:16,220
Do women these days find their potential husbands like this?

544
01:03:16,220 --> 01:03:20,960
Is throwing yourself onto a strange man using the excuse of a ghost your strategy?

545
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:24,050
If you don't want to have regrets, let go of this hand.

546
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:30,530
Regret is something humans do. Ghosts don't regret.
