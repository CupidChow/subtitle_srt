1
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:48,230
  Lady Sin communicated with the deposed King and committed a grave crime by helping him escape. 

2
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:51,640
  As her crime is of an extreme degree, she will be publicly executed. 

3
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:53,680
  - Your Highness! 
 - Your Highness the Queen! 

4
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:58,750
  You knew that our fates should never have crossed. 

5
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:03,690
  Now, I finally understand my father's words. 

6
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:10,090
  But, if we have already met and fallen in love, 

7
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:13,190
  I must take responsibility for that. 

8
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:18,600
Your Majesty!

9
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:22,890
Is the Royal Secretary here?  What about the Captain of Royal Guards?

10
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,200
No, it's not that.

11
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:29,090
 - Your Highness! 
 - She's so pitiful! 

12
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:38,400
The execution time was pushed forward? Who? Why?!

13
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,140
Her Highness the Queen Dowager gave the command

14
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:45,510
as she reasoned it was impossible to know what the escaped deposed King is planning.

15
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:56,700
  In this life, I wish to protect that love through death. 

16
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,420
Do you have any last words?

17
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,060
No.

18
00:02:10,790 --> 00:02:14,700
Proceed with the deposed Queen Sin's execution!

19
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:25,010
  If I am reborn, 

20
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:30,670
  I will never meet you, Your Majesty. 

21
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:49,470
Halt!

22
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,240
Halt!

23
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,660
 - Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty! 

24
00:03:08,520 --> 00:03:10,140
Chae Gyeong!

25
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:13,350
Chae Gyeong! Chae Gyeong...

26
00:03:14,690 --> 00:03:18,590
Why did you end up like this?! Why?!

27
00:03:44,740 --> 00:03:46,570
Let's go.

28
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,440
Move aside.

29
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:05,000
You said that this location was where the deposed King last slept.

30
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,280
I recently sent soldiers to scout this entire area but we couldn't find him.

31
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,840
Then searching through his relatives' houses will be the quickest.

32
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:18,850
Tell His Majesty that I will do as he wishes. I'll hand over the criminals.

33
00:04:18,850 --> 00:04:21,110
What's the reason you've suddenly changed your mind?

34
00:04:21,110 --> 00:04:24,060
There's no time to argue about that.

35
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:30,640
Because Sin Chae Gyeong's execution time was suddenly pushed forward, His Majesty had to personally race to the execution site.

36
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:31,780
What about Her Highness the Queen?

37
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:36,120
Although she's alive for now, His Majesty will also be put in a difficult situation if we don't hurry.

38
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,530
- Where are the culprits? 
 - Go to Mapo Port.

39
00:04:39,530 --> 00:04:41,520
Mapo Port... Let's go!

40
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:43,140
Yes, sir!

41
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:55,640
  Seok Hee and Gwang Ho 

42
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:59,080
  moved Seo No's grave to Dongjukjeon Village yesterday. 

43
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:01,260
  Yes, I heard. 

44
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,150
  You didn't come. 

45
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:05,260
  I was occupied with the merchant groups' work. 

46
00:05:05,260 --> 00:05:10,970
  I even went to that merchant group and received a report that you did not show up for 3 days! On top of that, 

47
00:05:10,970 --> 00:05:15,660
  I also received a report that you were seen at Yeokcham, Gimpo near the lodge that my brother last slept in. 

48
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,610
  Why did you do it? 

49
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:25,900
  Is this the world you so desperately wanted? 

50
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:31,670
  How did we end up like this? 

51
00:05:33,230 --> 00:05:36,200
  I'll give you a chance to set things straight. 

52
00:05:38,340 --> 00:05:40,690
  This is truly your last chance. 

53
00:05:59,170 --> 00:06:04,590
Your Majesty, the Captain of the Royal Guard requests to be in your presence.

54
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:06,700
Allow him to enter.

55
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:14,680
Your Majesty, I captured the real culprits involved in the deposed King's escape.

56
00:06:28,940 --> 00:06:32,420
  His Majesty the King is entering! 

57
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:40,920
We greet you, Your Majesty!

58
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:53,460
Your Majesty, these are the bandits who ambushed the dethroned King on his path to exile.

59
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:55,170
Why did you do it?

60
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:58,640
I-I've committed a crime worthy of death!

61
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:01,030
I asked, why did you do it?

62
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:06,090
We were... ordered to.

63
00:07:06,090 --> 00:07:08,330
What order?

64
00:07:08,330 --> 00:07:12,670
A-attack the deposed King and intentionally

65
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:16,180
- create a situation where he can escape—
- Eunuch Kim!

66
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:20,740
Yes, I intentionally delivered the news of the First Vice Premier's death.

67
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:27,030
I planned it so that the deposed King would run to the First Vice Premier's residence when he escaped.

68
00:07:27,030 --> 00:07:30,920
Who? Who is it?

69
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:33,630
Who ordered such a thing?

70
00:07:34,990 --> 00:07:36,940
Answer me!

71
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:39,580
The Right State Councillor.

72
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,670
I'm wronged, Your Majesty!

73
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,760
You're wronged?

74
00:07:57,570 --> 00:08:00,730
Eunuch Kim is the deposed King's person.

75
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:04,920
He's plotting revenge by creating a rift in our relationship, Your Majesty!

76
00:08:04,920 --> 00:08:11,510
The Right State Councillor's words are correct. You cannot just listen to their words and accuse him without a proper investigation!

77
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:15,180
That is correct, Your Majesty!

78
00:08:15,180 --> 00:08:19,880
More than anything, the Right State Councillor has given both his mental and material support towards your crowning

79
00:08:19,880 --> 00:08:22,410
and is your best subject.

80
00:08:22,410 --> 00:08:29,120
Your Majesty, please be unbiased and conduct a proper investigation!

81
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:33,400
Of course I will. I cannot believe just one witness

82
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:37,030
and punish an official of this nation.

83
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:39,740
I'm honored, Your Majesty.

84
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:52,250
Lock the criminals in their cells. I will investigate and punish accordingly!

85
00:08:52,250 --> 00:08:54,160
Drag them away and lock them in the cells!

86
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:56,580
Yes, Captain!

87
00:09:18,770 --> 00:09:22,950
Are you planning to concede the Queen's position to that Sin wench?!

88
00:09:22,950 --> 00:09:25,770
It's not conceding. It was never mine in the first place.

89
00:09:25,770 --> 00:09:32,730
Shut it! If you're going to spout such nonsense, leave for Ming immediately.

90
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:37,200
Even if you're not here, I have many ways to accomplish my goal.

91
00:09:45,740 --> 00:09:48,340
In the end, you tried to kill her?

92
00:09:48,340 --> 00:09:54,260
If Chae Gyeong dies in your hands because of your decision,

93
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:56,710
how do you expect me to live?

94
00:09:56,710 --> 00:10:01,440
That child's parents and all her relatives died

95
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:05,090
in your hands because of your decision.

96
00:10:05,090 --> 00:10:08,660
But, do you believe that she can forget that fact

97
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:14,060
and you can live together without suspecting and resenting each other?

98
00:10:14,060 --> 00:10:19,200
You're already unable to look directly into her eyes now

99
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:25,110
because you're sorry, miserable, and anxious.

100
00:10:25,110 --> 00:10:27,240
Are my words wrong?

101
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:30,970
Your words are correct.

102
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:33,610
There are times when I cannot look at her directly.

103
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:39,690
But if I express with words,

104
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:46,020
touch with my hands, and embrace with my heart,

105
00:10:47,110 --> 00:10:50,910
there will be a time when a scratch on the heart can heal.

106
00:10:50,910 --> 00:10:53,350
There will be a time when it will get better.

107
00:10:53,880 --> 00:10:57,460
"At times like this, we should always be together

108
00:10:57,460 --> 00:10:59,490
and tell each other "I love you",

109
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:04,230
tell one another how much we love each other, embrace one another, and treasure each other. That's what a married couple does!"

110
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:07,840
Chae Gyeong told me that.

111
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:10,240
So Royal Mother,

112
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:16,000
please leave the two of us alone.

113
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,760
I desperately beg of you.

114
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,360
  Who are you? 

115
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:47,220
  My name is Seo No. 

116
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:50,400
  My thoughts were wrong. 

117
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:52,680
  Since you're not beside me anymore, 

118
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:55,700
  I thought that it didn't matter how I lived from now on. 

119
00:11:55,700 --> 00:12:01,810
  I heard that love is respecting the decisions of the person you love and resembling each other in thought. 

120
00:12:01,810 --> 00:12:03,870
  That's why love is difficult. 

121
00:12:03,870 --> 00:12:09,070
  I realized the moment I saw Sin Chae Gyeong, 

122
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:15,600
  true love is respecting the decision of the person you love, 

123
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,720
  even if it leads to your death. 

124
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:29,750
  So, I'll save the woman whom you treasured so much, 

125
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,730
  Sin Chae Gyeong, 

126
00:12:32,730 --> 00:12:37,650
  and through this, I'll repay my debts to you. 

127
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,650
Chae Gyeong...

128
00:13:00,090 --> 00:13:01,750
Chae Gyeong!

129
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:08,730
Your Highness the Grand Prince.

130
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:10,740
Are you all right?

131
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:15,920
What happened?

132
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,030
What were you thinking when you saved me?!

133
00:13:19,030 --> 00:13:21,560
What about you? What were you thinking?

134
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,060
You should have said that it was all a lie, a false accusation!

135
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,960
You should have requested me to catch whoever framed you!

136
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:31,510
You should have flailed and shouted that you were framed!

137
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:35,410
How could you have thoughts of dying?

138
00:13:35,410 --> 00:13:39,350
What if there is something I'm more afraid of than death?

139
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,900
What do I do then?

140
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:47,610
What if there is something I must put my life on the line to protect?

141
00:13:48,500 --> 00:13:52,950
What should I do then?

142
00:13:53,940 --> 00:13:55,330
Chae Gyeong.

143
00:13:55,330 --> 00:14:01,380
Why can't I entirely become your woman?

144
00:14:03,210 --> 00:14:08,300
Your Majesty, I resent myself.

145
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:17,400
For the first time, I regret that I am me.

146
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,680
You courageously survived after losing that much blood.

147
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:07,480
What about Chae Gyeong? What happened to her?

148
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:12,500
Don't worry, Her Highness the Queen is safe.

149
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:20,180
You're not in a situation where you can move as you wish.

150
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:24,900
Let me go.

151
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:30,610
Do you have a reason you must survive?

152
00:15:30,610 --> 00:15:33,580
This is something I started.

153
00:15:33,580 --> 00:15:36,360
I have to finish it.

154
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:50,380
His Highness the Grand Prince used this for a long time.

155
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:55,500
He lived for five years without being able to properly breathe, walk, or smile.

156
00:15:56,840 --> 00:16:00,940
Now, it is your turn.

157
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:44,200
Where did it go?

158
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:48,060
Goodness, that scared me.

159
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:51,710
Why are you serving a spoon as if it's a god?

160
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:56,990
When your mother bought your dowry, she requested that I keep this.

161
00:16:56,990 --> 00:17:00,680
You never know who will attempt to harm you. That's why...

162
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:04,280
your meals should always be served in metal bowls

163
00:17:04,280 --> 00:17:07,330
and you should always eat with a silver spoon.

164
00:17:07,330 --> 00:17:12,340
 (They believed that a silver spoon or a metal dish would be discolored if the food was poisoned.)  

165
00:17:12,340 --> 00:17:15,040
Goodness, I said something I shouldn't have.

166
00:17:21,210 --> 00:17:23,790
Because you fear I might die?

167
00:17:26,230 --> 00:17:29,090
My Lady...

168
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:31,860
This isn't living.

169
00:17:31,860 --> 00:17:35,800
Even if you live for just a day, you shouldn't live like this.

170
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:39,120
What should we do?

171
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:52,600
Everyone, including Eunuch Kim, has committed suicide.

172
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,140
It seems the Right State Councillor's faction has gagged them.

173
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:07,900
Your Majesty, the witnesses to prove Her Highness the Queen's innocence

174
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,890
have all died.

175
00:18:09,890 --> 00:18:12,690
We can no longer believe the witnesses' initial testimonies

176
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,420
regarding Her Highness the Queen's innocence.

177
00:18:17,420 --> 00:18:21,310
We don't know where the deposed King is or what he is planning.

178
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:26,680
We cannot leave Her Highness the Queen alone when she is the sole witness and accomplice.

179
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:30,800
You must depose Her Highness the Queen. For the sake of the Royal Family and the Court—

180
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,590
I will not allow it.

181
00:18:37,400 --> 00:18:40,520
Anyone who continues to accuse the Queen

182
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,560
and requests her deposal without new evidence

183
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:49,910
will be punished for the crime of scorning the Royal Family.

184
00:18:49,910 --> 00:18:53,710
Your Majesty, please do not reject our loyalty!

185
00:18:53,710 --> 00:18:57,480
Please understand!

186
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:12,540
  We came this far. 

187
00:19:12,540 --> 00:19:15,870
  If we give up now, we'll be giving up right before the summit. 

188
00:19:15,870 --> 00:19:19,130
Who placed the current King on the throne?

189
00:19:19,130 --> 00:19:24,780
It's all thanks to us. We risked our lives and fought against the tyrannical Yeonsangun.

190
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:29,260
But now, His Majesty has chosen to close his eyes and ears and is rejecting the cries of his subjects.

191
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:35,040
Therefore, we must deliver the will of the people, the will of the Heavens, to His Majesty!

192
00:19:35,040 --> 00:19:38,250
Our Snail Brides must continue

193
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:41,130
to uphold the order of the Heavens

194
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:43,440
and deliver the will of the people and the Heavens to His Majesty!

195
00:19:43,440 --> 00:19:45,850
Yes, My Lord!

196
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:05,390
I will leave for Ming.

197
00:20:05,390 --> 00:20:07,050
Didn't I tell you to leave?

198
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:10,890
But, what's the use of your actions now?

199
00:20:10,890 --> 00:20:14,600
Without me, the Queen's position is useless.

200
00:20:14,600 --> 00:20:18,570
So for our lives and our clan's safety,

201
00:20:18,570 --> 00:20:21,590
please do not create anymore tension with His Majesty and instead—

202
00:20:21,590 --> 00:20:24,240
You still have a long way to go.

203
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,900
Do you think you're my only niece?

204
00:20:26,900 --> 00:20:31,460
No, nieces are useless when I  also have a daughter.

205
00:20:31,460 --> 00:20:34,490
Look here, allow her to enter!

206
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,840
Yes, My Lordship.

207
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,470
Father, did you call for me?

208
00:20:46,470 --> 00:20:47,830
Uncle!

209
00:20:47,830 --> 00:20:51,310
Introduce yourself, she's my adopted daughter.

210
00:20:54,030 --> 00:20:57,510
You're planning to make your adopted daughter into His Majesty's Queen?

211
00:20:57,510 --> 00:20:59,660
There's no reason I can't.

212
00:20:59,660 --> 00:21:02,430
I'll become the King's father-in-law.

213
00:21:11,970 --> 00:21:15,550
His Majesty the King is entering!

214
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:24,310
Your Majesty, you're here.

215
00:21:24,310 --> 00:21:26,360
Are you feeling better?

216
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:28,470
Yes, Your Majesty.

217
00:21:40,290 --> 00:21:45,250
Did you have a dispute with your subordinates again today, Your Majesty?

218
00:21:45,250 --> 00:21:49,960
Without any disputes, how am I supposed to run the nation?

219
00:21:51,380 --> 00:21:56,360
I heard that there has been a dispute about me for days now, Your Majesty.

220
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,370
Who's been talking about such useless nonsense?!

221
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:03,830
We apologize, Your Majesty!

222
00:22:10,750 --> 00:22:12,530
Your Majesty.

223
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:18,710
I don't really know much about the customs and manners of the royal family.

224
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:26,490
However, in non-royal households, they cut off the ribbon of the hanbok's jacket

225
00:22:26,490 --> 00:22:29,070
to bid farewell.

226
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:43,290
Chae Gyeong. Chae Gyeong.

227
00:22:47,730 --> 00:22:50,570
If I don't cut it off first,

228
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,970
I know that you will never let me go.

229
00:22:58,450 --> 00:23:02,020
I would like to divorce you, Your Majesty.

230
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:04,440
Please grant me permission.

231
00:23:07,490 --> 00:23:09,320
Your Majesty.

232
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:14,540
My answer,

233
00:23:15,950 --> 00:23:18,010
you obviously know what it is.

234
00:23:19,350 --> 00:23:24,100
Reconciliation, overcoming obstacles, courage,

235
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:27,850
resolutions, promises, and consolation...

236
00:23:27,850 --> 00:23:30,550
We can be together and do those things.

237
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:33,990
We have so much we can do for each other.

238
00:23:33,990 --> 00:23:39,300
Why is it that you want to say goodbye before even trying anything?!

239
00:23:39,910 --> 00:23:43,380
I put you through so much, and when I think about that, I just can't bring myself to do this.

240
00:23:43,380 --> 00:23:47,310
No, it won't happen.

241
00:23:50,010 --> 00:23:51,810
Your Majesty.

242
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:57,360
When you were Young Master Nak Cheon in the past,

243
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:00,830
you pushed me away with all those lies.

244
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,800
Please recall how you felt at the time.

245
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,700
Out of all those lies you told,

246
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:10,640
the only truth was regarding my safety.

247
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,100
Isn't that right, Your Majesty?

248
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:21,930
The only thing that I also hope for is

249
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:25,060
your safety,  Your Majesty.

250
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:30,340
And also for that path that you'll be taking

251
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:34,060
there will be Seo No, my parents,

252
00:24:34,060 --> 00:24:37,450
and there will be many people in this nation of Joseon who will put all their hopes in you.

253
00:24:37,450 --> 00:24:39,930
So please be determined to carry on your duty

254
00:24:39,930 --> 00:24:42,200
and achieve all your goals.

255
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:46,980
Afterwards, you can come to me.

256
00:24:46,980 --> 00:24:52,190
Why can't we go on that path together?

257
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:55,720
Because there is a constant threat of death.

258
00:24:55,720 --> 00:25:00,460
Both you and I are always on the verge of death.

259
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,190
As long as we are together, this will never end.

260
00:25:06,020 --> 00:25:10,960
Now you have finally become the ruler of this nation.

261
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:16,000
So now you have to be finally afraid of death.

262
00:25:19,710 --> 00:25:22,690
So, you should try to survive at all costs.

263
00:25:23,920 --> 00:25:25,720
Chae Gyeong!

264
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:32,140
Perhaps the best way we can comfort each other is

265
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:35,500
by surviving through it all.

266
00:25:36,170 --> 00:25:41,110
So, the two of us being alive and well for a long, long time

267
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:48,070
will be proof of our endless love for each other.

268
00:25:50,930 --> 00:25:53,500
If I live for one year,

269
00:25:54,560 --> 00:25:58,120
then I will be loving you for a year.

270
00:25:58,120 --> 00:26:01,610
If I live for ten years, then I'll be loving for ten years.

271
00:26:03,140 --> 00:26:05,180
If I live for 100 years,

272
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:10,080
then I will be loving you for 100 years.

273
00:26:10,670 --> 00:26:12,380
Yes.

274
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:17,750
If we are both alive, even if we are not together

275
00:26:19,220 --> 00:26:21,150
that in itself

276
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:28,550
is us loving each other through all the years.

277
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:32,620
There will be a lot of important things to do

278
00:26:32,620 --> 00:26:35,550
and although you may have left home temporarily,

279
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:42,080
that home will still remain as it did before.

280
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,020
Can't that home be here?

281
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:53,820
This home belongs to the Queen.

282
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:59,670
I am just Sin Chae Gyeong.

283
00:27:00,250 --> 00:27:06,780
♫  Waiting for me at the place where we  first met.  ♫

284
00:27:06,780 --> 00:27:14,670
♫  Sorry, I didn't know so please forgive me.  ♫

285
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:21,490
♫  Please don't go, so I can see you again.  ♫

286
00:27:21,490 --> 00:27:28,840
♫  I will love once again. You.  ♫

287
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:38,500
♫  Forever and ever ...  us.  ♫

288
00:27:43,340 --> 00:27:44,790
Look over here.

289
00:27:44,790 --> 00:27:45,930
Move away, move away.

290
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:47,950
Read this over here.

291
00:27:47,950 --> 00:27:51,180
Read that.

292
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:54,490
Yes, that's true.

293
00:27:55,540 --> 00:27:58,700
He's coming.

294
00:27:58,700 --> 00:28:00,920
My goodness.

295
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,400
Oh my.

296
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:08,550
His Majesty is entering.

297
00:28:09,450 --> 00:28:12,940
We greet you, Your Majesty.

298
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:20,540
I've been hearing that there was a lot of commotion in the capital last night.

299
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:23,590
And they say that the Snail Brides have been active again.

300
00:28:24,340 --> 00:28:28,360
Have you seen it by any chance, Right State Councillor?

301
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:33,240
Your Majesty, how could that only be the will of the Snail Brides?

302
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:38,950
I saw the people of this nation uniting with one voice and one mind as I was entering the palace.

303
00:28:38,950 --> 00:28:41,680
Oh, so you saw?

304
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:44,050
Yes, that's right, Your Majesty.

305
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:48,640
You might be able to ignore the voices of the governing officials, but the will of the heavens and the people

306
00:28:48,640 --> 00:28:52,560
should never be ignored.

307
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,380
You're right.

308
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,060
I should not do that.

309
00:28:58,060 --> 00:29:02,240
So then, about the deposing of the Queen...

310
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:15,180
It seems you got it all wrong.

311
00:29:19,860 --> 00:29:22,030
What in the world is this?

312
00:29:22,030 --> 00:29:27,410
- Your Majesty!
- Park Won Jong,  during the process of confiscating the wealth of the deposed king's close associates,

313
00:29:27,410 --> 00:29:30,580
Shim Geun Son, Kim Sook Hwa,

314
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:33,880
Choi Sook Won, and Jang Son's homes which were confiscated for practically nothing

315
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,630
he expanded his own home and built many living quarters all over the place.

316
00:29:39,830 --> 00:29:45,530
Park Won Jong was also responsible for the members of the rebel faction named Jo Gye Hyeong and Kim Soo Gyeong

317
00:29:45,530 --> 00:29:47,610
by having meetings with them periodically.

318
00:29:47,610 --> 00:29:53,270
And sold the low level government administrators' posts in the provinces which they requested.

319
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:58,240
The meeting itself is all about collecting bribes. And there also is a notorious rumor going around by officials...

320
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,940
Your Majesty! This is a false accusation!

321
00:30:07,790 --> 00:30:09,290
Bring in the witness.

322
00:30:09,290 --> 00:30:12,170
Bring the witness in.

323
00:30:23,530 --> 00:30:25,990
I don't know them, Your Majesty.

324
00:30:50,050 --> 00:30:51,880
How could you...

325
00:30:55,430 --> 00:30:59,300
Are you going to try to get out of this by killing all the witnesses again?

326
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,780
Do you have anything more to say?

327
00:31:12,950 --> 00:31:14,820
Royal Secretary.

328
00:31:14,820 --> 00:31:17,080
Yes, Your Majesty.

329
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:20,150
Strip Right State Councillor Park Won Jong of his government position.

330
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:22,990
And confiscate all of his wealth, that he obtained unlawfully.

331
00:31:22,990 --> 00:31:26,860
And punish him for what he did by exiling him.

332
00:31:26,860 --> 00:31:30,420
Your Majesty! This is all a plot to frame me!

333
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:33,710
I've been wronged!

334
00:31:33,710 --> 00:31:39,200
If this man acknowledges his crime and shows any remorse, I'll stop right here.

335
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,730
But if he keeps on denying and pretending that he didn't do anything wrong,

336
00:31:42,730 --> 00:31:48,380
then I will take this as him scorning me.

337
00:31:48,380 --> 00:31:50,870
I will punish him by execution

338
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:55,230
and annihilate all his relatives for high treason!

339
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:59,960
I will uphold your command.

340
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:04,770
Your Majesty.... You cannot do this.

341
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,900
Your Majesty!

342
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:35,510
Your Highness the Queen.

343
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:43,110
You're leaving?

344
00:33:02,800 --> 00:33:07,570
I apologize for causing you concern.

345
00:33:07,570 --> 00:33:09,840
There's nothing to apologize for.

346
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:17,810
Add this to your living.

347
00:33:21,060 --> 00:33:27,510
What can you do when there is a fate where you must separate to protect each other?

348
00:33:27,510 --> 00:33:30,450
Please protect him, even if it's from a distance.

349
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:37,410
I'll remember your words.

350
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:18,800
Your Majesty!

351
00:35:15,230 --> 00:35:22,290
  From now on, because my day consists of loving and missing you, 

352
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:26,640
  to love and miss you even more, 

353
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:31,270
  I will survive and survive again. 

354
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:39,370
  Like that, we find our own ways to protect each other. 

355
00:36:26,590 --> 00:36:31,500
"I... never escaped,

356
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:38,590
so Queen Sin has never helped me escape."

357
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:43,220
You must deliver this message.

358
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:59,990
Your Majesty, the Captain of the Royal Guard is here!

359
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:03,350
Allow him to enter.

360
00:37:06,870 --> 00:37:11,230
Your Majesty, the deposed King Lee Yoong came to his exile location on his own.

361
00:37:11,230 --> 00:37:14,950
He even sent a handwritten statement

362
00:37:14,950 --> 00:37:18,230
that he never intended to escape and that Queen Sin was framed.

363
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:26,780
  Hyungnim must have also wanted to save Chae Gyeong. 

364
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:58,050
 After your parting without acknowledgement, only a sense of helplessness grows... 

365
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:42,290
  As the winds grow stronger every day and night, I am gravely concerned for Your Majesty's health. 

366
00:38:42,290 --> 00:38:48,710
  As your vigor would be drained at this month of the year, if possible, please refrain from drinking 

367
00:38:48,710 --> 00:38:54,200
  and maintain your vigor by foods and herbal tonics that replenish your energy. 

368
00:38:54,890 --> 00:39:01,230
  As I think of you every night, my heart sinks. 

369
00:39:02,270 --> 00:39:08,850
  I beg that my earnestness is transmitted through Your Majesty's health and heart. 

370
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:42,390
Hyungnim!

371
00:39:44,780 --> 00:39:47,130
Hyungnim, are you all right?

372
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:02,530
Yeok...

373
00:40:04,930 --> 00:40:06,830
Yeok, is that you?

374
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:12,350
Yes, I'm Yeok.

375
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,930
I'm here.

376
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:37,560
I came to see you.

377
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:48,870
Leave. Do you know what this place is?

378
00:40:48,870 --> 00:40:51,610
What pathetic sight did you come to see?

379
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:56,440
How much more are you planning to laugh at me?!

380
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:04,760
Hyungnim!

381
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:18,320
Hyungnim,  Hyungnim...

382
00:41:21,280 --> 00:41:23,660
Have you regained your consciousness?

383
00:41:39,850 --> 00:41:42,420
Do you see me now?

384
00:41:46,330 --> 00:41:54,550
How vain and futile...

385
00:42:00,950 --> 00:42:09,090
I wanted to prove that Royal Father's decision was wrong,

386
00:42:10,330 --> 00:42:12,390
but in no time,

387
00:42:13,330 --> 00:42:20,270
just like he predicted, I became a tyrannical king.

388
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:26,880
I resembled my mother,

389
00:42:26,880 --> 00:42:31,560
who became blinded by jealousy and destroyed herself.

390
00:42:33,370 --> 00:42:34,670
Yeok.

391
00:42:34,670 --> 00:42:36,140
Yes?

392
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:43,660
I never hated you.

393
00:42:46,140 --> 00:42:51,880
I hated the person who was reflected in your eyes, me.

394
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:59,190
And the person who had the exact same eyes as you,

395
00:42:59,980 --> 00:43:03,150
Chae Gyeong's eyes...

396
00:43:04,690 --> 00:43:08,430
I was ashamed to look into those eyes.

397
00:43:08,430 --> 00:43:14,700
So I tried to kill you and tried to ruin you.

398
00:43:16,510 --> 00:43:25,530
I just...  hated and resented myself.

399
00:43:27,670 --> 00:43:30,960
In the end, because I separated you two,

400
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,760
I was punished and left in this state.

401
00:43:35,760 --> 00:43:37,650
That's what it is...

402
00:43:47,020 --> 00:43:48,890
H-Hyungnim!

403
00:43:56,990 --> 00:44:04,450
The punishment I did not receive in this life,

404
00:44:06,220 --> 00:44:08,410
I'll receive in death.

405
00:44:27,330 --> 00:44:29,770
He's here.

406
00:44:30,780 --> 00:44:37,730
Finally, he's... reaching his hand out to me.

407
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,930
Hyungnim...

408
00:45:21,710 --> 00:45:23,820
Hyung—

409
00:45:38,740 --> 00:45:42,640
You should've at least had a meal with me before you left!

410
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:52,290
In a world void of

411
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:56,000
hate,

412
00:45:57,600 --> 00:46:02,150
resentment, and uneasiness, please,

413
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:07,780
please rest comfortably.

414
00:46:29,350 --> 00:46:32,730
Aunt.  ( Deposed Queen Sin, wife of the deposed king and aunt of Sin Chae Gyeong) 

415
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,650
I brought some snacks.

416
00:46:39,650 --> 00:46:43,610
I was making some cotton clothing to send to His Majesty and the Crown Prince

417
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:49,400
because I wasn't able to give His Majesty a birthday present.

418
00:46:50,980 --> 00:46:53,170
I'll help.

419
00:46:56,150 --> 00:46:58,010
My Lady!

420
00:47:00,460 --> 00:47:04,780
Someone from the palace— no, from Gyo-Dong is here.

421
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:09,800
The deposed King has passed away.

422
00:48:20,460 --> 00:48:24,650
  Royal Mother, happy birthday! 

423
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:37,210
  Crown Prince, isn't this a hair-pin? How did you... 

424
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:39,380
  Do you like it? 

425
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,430
  - Of course I do! 
- You should try it on! 

426
00:48:56,350 --> 00:48:59,610
  Tell Yeok to become King. 

427
00:49:00,220 --> 00:49:05,170
  Then in his place, I'll become Chae Gyeong's husband, 

428
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:10,130
  the First Vice Premier's son-in-law, and your 

429
00:49:11,120 --> 00:49:16,100
  son and live like that. 

430
00:49:26,100 --> 00:49:27,870
Your Majesty,

431
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:32,170
in our next life,

432
00:49:34,070 --> 00:49:37,670
please be born as my daughter.

433
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:44,960
I'll treasure you greatly.

434
00:49:47,010 --> 00:49:48,660
Your Majesty...

435
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:26,530
It seems the horse is exhausted. Let's rest here for a moment.

436
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,770
Yes, Your Majesty.

437
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:42,910
Your Highness the Queen.

438
00:50:43,850 --> 00:50:45,380
Eunuch Song.

439
00:50:45,380 --> 00:50:49,810
His Majesty the King is in front of the house right now.

440
00:50:49,810 --> 00:50:55,010
He said his horse is exhausted and wants to rest for a moment.

441
00:50:58,050 --> 00:51:02,600
Please wait. I'll boil some horse feed.

442
00:51:10,730 --> 00:51:15,990
Her Highness the Queen said she would boil some horse feed.

443
00:51:15,990 --> 00:51:17,910
Boil horse feed?

444
00:51:18,850 --> 00:51:22,080
What about me? Didn't she ask for me?

445
00:52:35,250 --> 00:52:37,080
Chae Gyeong.

446
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:44,200
Please feed your horse this.

447
00:52:46,460 --> 00:52:48,050
Sin Chae Gyeong.

448
00:52:48,050 --> 00:52:51,320
I apologize for not being able to greet you.

449
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:02,860
I'm sorry, I'll get another bowl.

450
00:53:02,860 --> 00:53:05,610
Can't you show me your face just once?

451
00:53:06,580 --> 00:53:09,840
If I just push this door, we can meet.

452
00:53:12,630 --> 00:53:15,480
Do you truly expect me to leave like this?

453
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:19,880
"No",

454
00:53:20,430 --> 00:53:22,660
please just say that one word.

455
00:53:23,590 --> 00:53:28,590
Then I will open this door, run to you,

456
00:53:30,950 --> 00:53:33,410
and embrace you.

457
00:53:35,120 --> 00:53:37,650
Did you forget?

458
00:53:40,700 --> 00:53:42,880
To have to see each other,

459
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:51,240
to have to be together, to have hands touch, aren't the only ways to love.

460
00:53:54,220 --> 00:54:01,540
We are different from others, so we decided that not being together and not meeting,

461
00:54:01,540 --> 00:54:06,030
that is how we would protect our love for each other.

462
00:54:06,030 --> 00:54:08,790
Are you wavering already?

463
00:54:37,590 --> 00:54:40,620
 Do you truly wish for me to leave like this? 

464
00:54:42,210 --> 00:54:45,750
 Dragon 

465
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:51,180
Husband! Grand Prince!

466
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,140
Husband!

467
00:54:52,140 --> 00:54:58,610
♫   Suddenly the whole world is filled by you  ♫

468
00:54:59,740 --> 00:55:04,860
♫   Suddenly you were there without a sound  ♫

469
00:55:04,860 --> 00:55:10,500
 This won't do, Chae Gyeong. I can't live without you. 

470
00:55:10,500 --> 00:55:13,330
 Don't go. 

471
00:55:13,330 --> 00:55:15,390
 Let us be together. 

472
00:55:15,390 --> 00:55:21,940
♫  What do I do now when my breath is about to stop?    ♫

473
00:55:25,810 --> 00:55:30,140
♫   I want to hold you   ♫

474
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:32,620
♫   the one whose brilliance chillls my heart   ♫

475
00:55:32,620 --> 00:55:33,680
 What's this? 

476
00:55:33,680 --> 00:55:35,840
♫   I'm afraid you might fly away   ♫

477
00:55:35,840 --> 00:55:37,890
 It's a perfect fit. 

478
00:55:37,890 --> 00:55:41,310
♫   when the wind blows   ♫

Chae Gyeong...

491
00:57:12,860 --> 00:57:20,820
 Your Majesty, I am very grateful for your desire to reinstate me.  

492
00:57:20,820 --> 00:57:26,170
 However, Your Majesty already has a prince, your first son. 

493
00:57:26,170 --> 00:57:31,570
 If I were to re-enter the palace to be Queen, the child that would be born from me 

494
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:35,610
 would be engulfed in the royal power struggle.  

495
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:39,460
 Please consider that happened to Your Majesty and Your Majesty's older brother. 

496
00:57:39,460 --> 00:57:44,330
 In this world, for another story as tragic as the story of you two brothers 

497
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:47,860
 to occur again wouldn't be something you'd desire. 

498
00:57:48,620 --> 00:57:50,790
 Nanny, the sleeve... 

499
00:57:50,790 --> 00:57:52,310
 One hand-width. 

500
00:57:52,310 --> 00:57:55,930
 And the shoulders... 

501
00:57:56,930 --> 00:58:00,230
 One span of hand too.  One span. 

502
00:58:00,230 --> 00:58:03,730
 Then add more to... Oh, seriously.  

503
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:06,880
  Why didn't you just borrow a set of clothes from him? What suffering is this! 

504
00:58:06,880 --> 00:58:09,770
 I'm not smart so my body has to suffer.  

505
00:58:09,770 --> 00:58:13,040
 What's the brain for? 

506
00:58:13,040 --> 00:58:17,220
 How painful was it?   

507
00:58:17,220 --> 00:58:20,600
 How frightening was it?  

508
00:58:21,690 --> 00:58:28,030
 We cannot allow ourselves to recreate that tragedy again.  

509
00:58:28,030 --> 00:58:32,130
 For me, Your Majesty, 

510
00:58:32,130 --> 00:58:37,510
 living strong for us,  

511
00:58:37,510 --> 00:58:40,120
 is already more than enough.  

512
00:58:44,210 --> 00:58:50,960
 Thirty-eight years later. 1544. 39th year  of Jungjong's reign.   

513
00:59:04,120 --> 00:59:06,010
Eunuch Song.

514
00:59:06,010 --> 00:59:08,680
Yes, Your Majesty.

515
00:59:15,290 --> 00:59:19,270
 His Majesty's royal body is indisposed. 

516
00:59:21,690 --> 00:59:26,060
 Open all gates that lead to the Grand Palace. 

517
00:59:26,060 --> 00:59:31,290
 Do not control the entrances and exits. And do not place guards. 

518
00:59:34,530 --> 00:59:39,280

 Grand Prince! 

528
01:00:46,150 --> 01:00:48,890
 Grand Prince, when did you arrive? 

529
01:00:48,890 --> 01:00:52,520
 Bird poop, did you wait long?  

530
01:00:54,000 --> 01:00:57,310
 I'm used to waiting for you. 

531
01:01:35,080 --> 01:01:38,630
 Am I too late? 

532
01:01:38,630 --> 01:01:43,960
 No. You're not late at all. 

533
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:48,080
 It's been very hard for you.  

534
01:01:49,620 --> 01:01:52,450
 I am so proud of you.  

535
01:01:54,110 --> 01:02:00,330
 You endured through it all very well.  

536
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:08,090
 Because I knew you were waiting, I could endure it. 

537
01:02:09,010 --> 01:02:13,010
 Because I knew you were there in that place,  

538
01:02:13,860 --> 01:02:20,380
 I also could protect my place. 

539
01:02:25,660 --> 01:02:32,670


540
01:02:36,440 --> 01:02:42,060
 Now, I will be by your side, my husband. 

541
01:02:43,350 --> 01:02:47,520
 So please rest comfortably at home now. 

542
01:02:48,450 --> 01:02:51,490
 Now I've finally come home. 

543
01:02:53,670 --> 01:02:59,300
 I pine for you.  I admire you.   

544
01:02:59,300 --> 01:03:03,390
 I love you, my husband. 

545
01:03:04,860 --> 01:03:06,620
 You can just do one. 

546
01:03:13,080 --> 01:03:18,480
♫  Dearest, leave in peace now.  ♫

547
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,990
♫  You are waking up from a harsh dream.  ♫

548

♫  As time passes, as you count the seasons   ♫

549
01:03:29,300 --> 01:03:34,650
♫  Will you be able to forget even the painful memories?   ♫

550
01:03:34,650 --> 01:03:39,990
♫  The feeling it was all my fault festers in my heart  ♫

551
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:44,720
♫  This heart is tinged with the color red    ♫

552
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:51,010
♫  Just know that you are drenched by the sunset  ♫
