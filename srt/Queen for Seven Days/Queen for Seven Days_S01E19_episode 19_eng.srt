1
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:46,100
His Majesty the King is entering!

2
00:00:46,100 --> 00:00:49,540
We greet you, Your Majesty!

3
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:57,630


4
00:00:59,630 --> 00:01:04,200
Until now the King has lost his sense of duty

5
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,460
and as a result, politics and corporal punishment became complicated and cruel.

6
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:13,420
And  yet, though the people may be  suffering from difficulty,  he did not seek to save them.

7
00:01:13,420 --> 00:01:19,400
Thankfully, the ministers thought of their duties to this nation and to the people,

8
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:25,140
thus recommending me as ruler. It was not fitting for me to refuse

9
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:28,960
so I have ascended  the royal throne.

10
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:34,800
Thousand years! Thousand years! Thousands of thousand years may the King reign!

11
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:38,460
Thousand years! Thousand years!

12
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,170
Those treasonous officials and those who have plundered the people will be punished accordingly.

13
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:49,380
The innocent people and the innocent ministers who were arrested will be appropriately vindicated.

14
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,440
I will declare my intentions throughout the land.

15
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,880
Moreover, I will first look after the needs of the people.

16
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:59,230
And return to you the homes taken from you.

17
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,600
Your Majesty! The King! Your Majesty!

18
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:05,930
 Episode 19 

19
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,960
Just like you wanted, Orabeoni Nak Cheon

20
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:25,580
finally became the King.

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,930
However as you wished, I'm not sure whether Orabeoni Nak Cheon

22
00:02:31,930 --> 00:02:34,510
can happily live out a hundred year contract (marriage)

23
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,620
with that Lady Sin as you wished.

24
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:57,390
  Yeok, you've finally become the King. 

25
00:02:58,660 --> 00:03:03,610
  Thanks to you, my revenge has been completed. 

26
00:03:03,610 --> 00:03:10,340
  I'll make you King and repay you for the pain I experienced 

27
00:03:10,340 --> 00:03:12,930
  while I was King. 

28
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,020
Chae Gyeong.

29
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,660
This is the heart.

30
00:03:59,210 --> 00:04:00,910
That way I'll die.

31
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:18,460
Was it your command, dear husband?

32
00:04:19,090 --> 00:04:21,840
Regardless of whomever did such an act,

33
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,600
it necessarily happened in the process of my enthronement

34
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:28,530
by people acting in my best interest.

35
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:32,030
Yet, it is my responsibility.

36
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:37,340
I couldn't keep the promise.

37
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,080
If you want to seek revenge, please kill me!

38
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:54,260
Chae Gyeong.

39
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:53,960
Were you looking for me?

40
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:56,600
I hope you can help me.

41
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,660
W-what happened...

42
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:01,930
Y-Your Majesty!

43
00:06:52,210 --> 00:06:57,100
  Tomorrow, I'll return with a proper proposal gift. 

44
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,200
  This is enough for me. 

45
00:07:39,860 --> 00:07:41,620
My Lady!

46
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,460
Nanny.

47
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,840
His Majesty has sent someone.

48
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:10,530
  His Majesty the King has declared that the First Vice Premier and His Ladyship 

49
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:16,230
  not be connected to the dethroned King and be marked traitors. Instead, they will be connected to Your Highness the Queen and be 

50
00:08:16,230 --> 00:08:19,150
  respected as subjects of this nation. 

51
00:08:19,150 --> 00:08:23,830
  So in the case that you miss your parents or wish to see them, 

52
00:08:23,830 --> 00:08:28,400
  you may come to this place anytime and be comforted. 

53
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:33,240
  It seems there is nothing more I can do for you as your father. 

54
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:36,680
 So from now on, follow the will of Grand Prince Jin Seong 

55
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:39,040
  and live as just his wife. 

56
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:43,190
Mother, Father.

57
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:50,900
It seems your son-in-law is very sorry.

58
00:08:52,570 --> 00:08:55,570
Because he must want to apologize somehow,

59
00:08:57,230 --> 00:09:00,280
because he must want to comfort me somehow,

60
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:03,920
he's trying so hard.

61
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:19,840
Your Majesty, Her Highness the Queen wishes to see you.

62
00:09:26,740 --> 00:09:28,400
You're here.

63
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,830
Come in.

64
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,960
I'll take a look.

65
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:45,510
♫   You approached silently   ♫

66
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:54,750
♫   You smiled at me while offering your hand   ♫

67
00:10:54,750 --> 00:11:00,900
♫   The time we spent together   ♫

68
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:04,040
Please breathe. 
 ♫   is going far away   ♫

69
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:07,480
Sure.
♫   like a dream   ♫

70
00:11:08,920 --> 00:11:15,690
♫   I can't stand the longing now which is growing so   ♫

71
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:20,960
♫   Why didn't I know loving would be like this?   ♫

72
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,510
My father was holding onto this.

73
00:11:23,510 --> 00:11:27,060
♫   I can't do anything else but leave   ♫

74
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,200
♫   even if I don't want to go   ♫

75
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:36,860
I'm sure someone left this behind to distance our relationship. 
 ♫   I now know that I can't live without you   ♫

76
00:11:37,890 --> 00:11:41,970
Why must we 
♫   Don't go far away   ♫

77
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:45,670
always witness others' deaths 
 ♫   so I can see you again   ♫

78
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:50,430
and hurt, suspect, and resent each other?
 ♫   I love you once again   ♫

79
00:11:50,430 --> 00:11:54,620
I'm sure couples are wed so that when 
 ♫   If we go back   ♫

80
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:58,750
difficult situations arise, they can embrace, 
 ♫   again in time,   ♫

81
00:11:58,750 --> 00:12:02,160
comfort each other, and remain together. 
 ♫   we used to look at each other   ♫

82
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,050
Why must we always 
♫   and laugh   ♫

83
00:12:05,050 --> 00:12:09,670
aim our swords at each other? 
 ♫   Although I know   ♫

84
00:12:09,670 --> 00:12:14,230
It's because I'm a bad husband. 
♫   I won't be able to see you one day,    ♫

85
00:12:14,230 --> 00:12:18,400
It's because I'm a bad man. 
♫   I know but I can't stop   ♫

86
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,590
It's because I'm the King.

87
00:12:21,630 --> 00:12:25,290
Yes, you are the King. 
 ♫   Wait for me at the place   ♫

88
00:12:25,290 --> 00:12:31,710
You became the King who can do anything. Therefore, 
 ♫   we first met. Will you forgive me   ♫

89
00:12:31,710 --> 00:12:34,600
please do not bow your head anymore. 
 ♫   if I can't go there?   ♫

90
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:40,960
Please ensure that no more tears shall be shed for our circumstances. 
 ♫   I can't do anything else but leave even if I don't want to go  ♫

91
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:44,600
I will not be tossed around anymore either. 
 ♫   I now know   ♫

92
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,930
Protecting you, who has become the King of a nation, 
 ♫   I can't live without you   ♫

93
00:12:47,930 --> 00:12:50,460
and protecting my place beside you 
 ♫   Even if I can't see you   ♫

94
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:57,520
will be my revenge against the people who killed my father and are trying to separate us. 
 ♫   if I turn away like this,   ♫

95
00:12:57,520 --> 00:13:02,430
So, you must become a strong ruler 
 ♫   I will love you once again   ♫

96
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:04,780
and protect us.

97
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:09,520
♫   Forever and ever   ♫

98
00:13:09,520 --> 00:13:11,360
I will.

99
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,530
♫   us   ♫

100
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:30,020
Seok Hee of the Baek Family is to be appointed the captain of the Royal Guard.

101
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:34,090
He is to be entrusted with the authority of the security of the main palace as well as the royal army command.

102
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:38,680
Gwang Jo of the Jo Family is named Fifth Royal Secretary of the Royal Secretariat.

103
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:41,800
To oversee the handling of the royal edicts.

104
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:50,810
Your grace is immeasurable!

105
00:13:56,470 --> 00:13:57,450
Get up.

106
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,990
Goodness, I'm fine, Your Majesty! Please rescind your command!

107
00:14:01,990 --> 00:14:03,820
I said, get up!

108
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:17,250
I have a favor to ask the two of you, not as the King

109
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:20,590
but as a friend.

110
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,850
Please command us!

111
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:28,940
Right now, officers of the capital bureau are removing the forbidden signs installed by the deposed king.

112
00:14:28,940 --> 00:14:33,470
In particular, I ordered them to dispose the markings

113
00:14:33,470 --> 00:14:35,330
from Dongjukjeon Village that was used as hunting ground.

114
00:14:35,330 --> 00:14:38,930
Wow! You did a great job, Your Majesty!

115
00:14:41,930 --> 00:14:47,510
Move the graves of Seo No and Seo No's father in the wilderness

116
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:51,310
to their old abode in Dongjukjeon

117
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:54,760
because that was one of Seo No's earnest wishes.

118
00:14:57,130 --> 00:15:00,970
And on that grave,

119
00:15:01,930 --> 00:15:04,180
please pour a drink.

120
00:15:04,580 --> 00:15:07,570
Deliver the news that someone named Nak Cheon became King

121
00:15:07,570 --> 00:15:14,210
and is working hard for the countless Seo Nos in Joseon.

122
00:15:14,210 --> 00:15:15,940
Be sure to let him know.

123
00:15:15,940 --> 00:15:18,990
We'll carry out your command!

124
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,850
The nanny of the Queen Sin family, of the Eom Clan will be appointed to rank 5a

125
00:15:24,850 --> 00:15:31,030
as a chamber lady, to receive yearly pensions of 10 units of rice, and three bolts of cotton.

126
00:15:31,030 --> 00:15:33,730
Henceforth, the palace staff of the Queen's palace

127
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:37,830
are to assist Palace Matron Eom so that she does not encounter any issues or difficulties in her service to the Queen,

128
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,390
and their special attention is requested.

129
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,480
Goodness...

130
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:49,340
Your grace is immeasurable!

131
00:16:02,390 --> 00:16:05,660
Leave it there. There's no need to take it along.

132
00:16:06,580 --> 00:16:08,300
I understand.

133
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,240
 Your Majesty, I have seen many lunar halos. 

134
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:24,470
 But the best lunar halo was the one above Gyeonghoeru Pavilion. 

135
00:16:24,470 --> 00:16:28,650
This is the only thing that's mine in this room.

136
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,440
Yes, Your Highness.

137
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:43,540
Your Majesty, I have entered the palace in a rush after receiving your message.

138
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:46,770
By any chance, is anything wrong?

139
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:55,870
In case my listing and distribution of rewards and merits

140
00:16:55,870 --> 00:17:00,110
are lacking, excessive, or missing, I summoned you to review it.

141
00:17:01,240 --> 00:17:04,670
Did you already finish organizing everything?

142
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:06,390
Read it.

143
00:17:06,390 --> 00:17:07,970
Yes, Your Majesty.

144
00:17:09,470 --> 00:17:13,430
"Divide the ministers who accomplished goals in the rebellion into 4 ranks.

145
00:17:13,430 --> 00:17:17,140
I shall set them as meritorious subjects of our nation. The first-ranked subjects are

146
00:17:17,140 --> 00:17:20,900
Park Won Jong,  Seong Il Hwan, Yoo Seung Jeong and  Ryu Ja Gwang.

147
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:24,010
Park Won Jong is named Right State Councilor, the Prince of the Court of Pyeongseong.

148
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:26,830
Yoo Seung Jeong as Prince of the Court of Cheoncheong.

149
00:17:26,830 --> 00:17:29,840
Seong Il Hwan as Minister of Personnel, Lord Jangsam.

150
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,950
Ryu Ja Gwang is reappointed as Prince of the Court Wooryeong.

151
00:17:33,950 --> 00:17:36,370
It's just that Park Won Jong—

152
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,860
Continue reading.

153
00:17:46,030 --> 00:17:49,960
ignored my command in the rebellion,

154
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:52,840
acted and made a decision on his own,

155
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:57,100
and harmed both the forces' discipline and the authority of the royal command...

156
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:00,810
Your Majesty!

157
00:18:00,810 --> 00:18:03,970
You disenfranchised all authority and qualifications of a meritorious subject.

158
00:18:03,970 --> 00:18:06,500
It was something that had to be done!

159
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:10,530
If the First Vice Premier had entered the palace, our plan could have failed!

160
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:13,040
The board had already tilted

161
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:17,500
and even if my father-in-law had entered the palace, it would've been after the nation's affairs had been demolished.

162
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:21,320
He wouldn't even have been able to meet the King. Regardless,

163
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:25,800
you proceeded with the assassination of my in-laws.

164
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:30,730
Using excessive force and defying the king's order!

165
00:18:32,230 --> 00:18:34,830
You dare to even act outside of your authority.

166
00:18:36,990 --> 00:18:39,520
Isn't this a crime worthy of death?

167
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:41,700
Your Majesty,

168
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,440
are you planning to walk down the same path as the dethroned King?

169
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:52,520
You cannot chase out a loyal minister like this.

170
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:56,890
You know better than anyone else that you cannot lead the court by yourself!

171
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,000
Of course, I know well. Therefore,

172
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:03,590
I will not announce this at the Council meeting.

173
00:19:04,260 --> 00:19:09,630
Instead, since I have spared you who deserves death,

174
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:13,770
it's as though you have used in advance your right to clemency which is granted to national meritorious subjects.

175
00:19:13,770 --> 00:19:15,750
So,

176
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:20,480
there will be no second bestowing of mercy upon you.

177
00:19:22,870 --> 00:19:27,770
Your grace is immeasurable.

178
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:44,480
The Court attire and the phoenix hairpin look splendid on you, Your Highness.

179
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,300
The formal edict of appointment needs to be bestowed soon, of course.

180
00:19:55,210 --> 00:19:58,070
I'm sure it'll come according to regulation.

181
00:19:58,070 --> 00:20:02,600
Regulation? Right, the deposed king and queen's family

182
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,930
are leaving for exile today. Did you know?

183
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:09,980
Of course.

184
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:13,030
Now, that I have become the mistress of the inner palace,

185
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:16,240
how can I not know of the palace affairs?

186
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:18,290
Then you, Lady of the Grand Prince—

187
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:25,230
I mean Your Highness the Queen, you must also know what will happen

188
00:20:25,230 --> 00:20:30,190
in the Royal Family and the Royal Court if you remain beside His Majesty like this.

189
00:20:31,660 --> 00:20:36,740
At the very least, I know who will be the most uncomfortable when I'm here.

190
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:41,610
Therefore, I desperately wish for that person to be a necessary asset to this nation

191
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,550
and to be a loyal subject who can protect His Majesty's side.

192
00:20:45,550 --> 00:20:50,600
That's how I'll be able to endure seeing him.

193
00:20:50,600 --> 00:20:57,500
Will the loyalty of your father who protected the dethroned King until the end be enough?

194
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:59,890
Do not insult my father!

195
00:20:59,890 --> 00:21:03,130
Insult? I'm respecting his loyalty.

196
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:05,100
Deputy Commander!

197
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:07,510
I will soon become the Right State Councilor.

198
00:21:07,940 --> 00:21:10,060
Then, until next time.

199
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:25,130
Your Majesty, Her Highness the Queen is here.

200
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,790
Allow her to enter.

201
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,790
Chae Gyeong.

202
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:38,900
You should take your medicine so that your wound will heal rapidly.

203
00:22:04,050 --> 00:22:07,910
Today, my brother and the family

204
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:11,240
will be taking off to the place of exile.

205
00:22:13,590 --> 00:22:16,310
I will make an order for special care for them.

206
00:22:16,310 --> 00:22:18,560
Don't worry too much.

207
00:23:29,170 --> 00:23:30,940
Please...

208
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:34,820
take care of your health, Your Majesty.

209
00:23:40,790 --> 00:23:44,420
He left the palace just now.

210
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:47,750
Is my aunt

211
00:23:48,570 --> 00:23:50,540
alright?

212
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:54,100
Yes, My Lady. She'll be at the Jungchong Palace till today

213
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:57,000
and will be going to her private home out in town tomorrow.

214
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,010
No, you cannot, Your Majesty.

215
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,650
How could you allow your wife Lady Sin to become the queen, Your Majesty?

216
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:07,680
It cannot be allowed for all of us to serve such a rebellious woman as the queen, Your Majesty.

217
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,650
I agree, Your Majesty.

218
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,910
Please look at the previous example of the deposed king.

219
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:16,660
Why do you think there was a disaster that one year?

220
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:19,310
What does he mean?

221
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:35,320
This is one of the books I've read till it wore out during my crown prince days.

222
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:40,500
 When the king loses the nation it is not the fault of the subjects; therefore, do not punish the subjects.  

223
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:43,290
It looks like you wrote it down personally, Your Majesty.

224
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:46,250
It's a content from the book of I-Ching called Seogwejun.

225
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:50,650
According to the book of I-Ching,

226
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:54,490
after there are husband and wife, there will be parents and children.

227
00:24:54,490 --> 00:24:56,890
And after there are parents and children,

228
00:24:56,890 --> 00:24:59,950
there will be the King and his subordinates.

229
00:24:59,950 --> 00:25:03,560
Therefore, a married couple is the root of humanity

230
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:06,470
and this means that  it is the base of my reign.

231
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:09,640
In order for me to be a good ruler,

232
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:13,660
I need to bring harmony into my own family and into my own marriage,

233
00:25:13,660 --> 00:25:17,250
so you should respect and uphold my orders.

234
00:25:18,580 --> 00:25:20,700
Are there any objections?

235
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,160
No, Your Majesty.

236
00:25:25,220 --> 00:25:33,210
So then, today I will be ordering the installation of Lady Sin as  Queen right away.

237
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:36,900
I will pick a date soon to hold an installation ceremony

238
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:39,450
so take a note of this and get ready.

239
00:25:39,450 --> 00:25:42,630
Your wish is my command, Your Majesty.

240
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:48,470
 Royal Edict to install Lady Sin as Queen 

241
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:55,510
It would be great if you can also be a support to Chae Gyeong.

242
00:25:55,510 --> 00:25:59,510
You know well that people all over the palace are her enemies.

243
00:26:01,630 --> 00:26:03,760
That's so true.

244
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,650
All the subordinates are against her,

245
00:26:06,650 --> 00:26:11,680
so why would you want to turn the subordinates into your enemies and protect a girl like Chae Gyeong?

246
00:26:11,680 --> 00:26:14,630
Chae Gyeong risked her own life

247
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:17,550
and even lost her own family along the way to look after me, Mother.

248
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:21,270
But if I can't give back for what she did for me

249
00:26:21,270 --> 00:26:24,580
then there wouldn't be any meaning for me to be king.

250
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:42,080
But it's still better than being stuck in that room, right?

251
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,380
You're right.

252
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,610
It will all pass, Your Highness.

253
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:49,360
Time flies by, you know.

254
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:51,280
After you blink your eyes a few times

255
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:56,340
you get wrinkles all over the place and you even get love handles too, like me, Your Highness.

256
00:26:56,340 --> 00:26:59,370
As you do that, a moment will come

257
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:04,190
where your heart that used to shake will quiet down.

258
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:07,960
It will really turn out that way, right?

259
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,910
Of course, Your Highness. Have you ever seen me lie to you?

260
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,600
I never have.

261
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:24,860
She hasn't even been installed officially yet anyway.

262
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:27,660
So what's this Queen business?

263
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:30,600
From what I heard, the governing officials are in an uproar against it.

264
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:35,260
Who knows? To put it bluntly, she might use her son to gain revenge like some crazy attacker you know.

265
00:27:35,260 --> 00:27:38,630
- No way. 
 -  Why are you saying, "no way" for?

266
00:27:44,500 --> 00:27:48,050
I must do something about your dirty mouth, for goodness sake.

267
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:51,700
Damn you. What are you going to do about it?

268
00:28:02,290 --> 00:28:05,790
The King is about to enter.

269
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:16,070
What are you doing here without any notice, Your Majesty?

270
00:28:16,070 --> 00:28:21,320
I have personally brought the scroll which installs you as the Queen.

271
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:24,370
Queen installation scroll?

272
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,630
You may receive it, Lady Sin.

273
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:44,350
As Lady Sin grew up to be an adult, she became my spouse.

274
00:28:44,350 --> 00:28:49,330
And she didn't have any flaws for making this family harmonious for all this time.

275
00:28:49,330 --> 00:28:54,940
I have now become the ruler of a country for its people

276
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:58,160
and you've already been my partner till now.

277
00:28:58,160 --> 00:29:01,660
And in order for me to make things right

278
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:04,750
I am now installing you as the Queen,

279
00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:10,810
so do not forget about this virtue. In one household and in one country,

280
00:29:10,810 --> 00:29:15,610
I hope that you'll wield influence, so respect this.

281
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:32,730
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

282
00:29:33,660 --> 00:29:36,470
Your Majesty.

283
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:38,550
Your Majesty.

284
00:29:58,970 --> 00:30:01,120
My queen.

285
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,480
I really thank you for

286
00:30:06,550 --> 00:30:08,870
staying by my side.

287
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:14,090
Congratulations, Your Highness the Queen.

288
00:30:16,890 --> 00:30:20,050
Congratulations, Your Highness the Queen.

289
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,740
Congratulations, Your Highness the Queen.

290
00:30:42,900 --> 00:30:47,260
 As a courtesy, I will be installing the former First Vice Premier, Sin Soo Geun as the most important contributor of the state 

291
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:51,400
 and I will install Lady Sin as the Queen. 

292
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,630
I've returned.

293
00:31:03,930 --> 00:31:07,540
You went to Seo No's grave again, didn't you?

294
00:31:07,540 --> 00:31:13,150
Now is not the time for you to be swayed by someone who cannot answer you. It's too late for that.

295
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,660
Did something happen, sir?

296
00:31:15,660 --> 00:31:19,700
The King has given Lady Sin the installation scroll today.

297
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:23,050
And the official ceremony will be held a few days from now.

298
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,680
Yes, I see.

299
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:30,950
Are you going to give up your rightful place as the Queen now?

300
00:31:30,950 --> 00:31:35,490
We've been caught with so much for us to change Orabeoni's mind.

301
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:38,840
I think we will have to find another way for us to raise back our clan again.

302
00:31:38,840 --> 00:31:41,430
You are worrying about our clan in a situation like this?!

303
00:31:41,430 --> 00:31:43,750
You'll be losing your head at this rate!

304
00:31:43,750 --> 00:31:45,370
What do you mean that I will be losing my head?

305
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,570
Imagine that Lady Sin becomes Queen and bears a son.

306
00:31:48,570 --> 00:31:50,530
Then that wench will be the core of power and authority.

307
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:56,300
Do you think she'll let us live for killing her father and annihilating all of her relatives then?

308
00:31:56,300 --> 00:32:00,440
Do you know that as soon as she gains power, she will try to get rid of us first?

309
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:02,880
So if you don't want to pay the price for that,

310
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,210
then there is no other way but to attack first.

311
00:32:25,380 --> 00:32:27,900
Seo No.

312
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,910
I cannot let them be as they are

313
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:36,570
because I have to survive too.

314
00:32:41,650 --> 00:32:44,890
Your Highness, it's Eunuch Kim.

315
00:32:54,750 --> 00:33:01,320
Your Highness, please at least drink some water. You'll faint at this rate.

316
00:33:01,320 --> 00:33:03,230
Head Eunuch.

317
00:33:03,230 --> 00:33:05,320
Yes, Your Highness?

318
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:07,280
Thank you.

319
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,200
How are the Queen and my children?

320
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:19,620
As of now, they should all be heading towards their exile location.

321
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,390
What happened to the First Vice Premier?

322
00:33:29,830 --> 00:33:31,750
That's...

323
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:41,470
Your Highness, His Lordship the First Vice Premier was assassinated 15 days ago.

324
00:33:46,540 --> 00:33:48,900
What did you just say?

325
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:54,740
His Lordship the First Vice Premier and His Ladyship have both passed away.

326
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:03,840
Why did the First Vice Premier die?

327
00:34:05,620 --> 00:34:10,830
Just in case, I intentionally distanced myself from him.

328
00:34:10,830 --> 00:34:15,720
I endured through the countless times I wanted to call him back again!

329
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:18,590
Please calm down, Your Highness!

330
00:34:18,590 --> 00:34:23,840
Was it Yeok's doing? Did the rebel forces kill him?

331
00:34:23,900 --> 00:34:29,100
I'm sorry, but I do not know.

332
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:36,290
Chae Gyeong... is she safe?

333
00:34:36,290 --> 00:34:38,900
If the rumors I hear are true,

334
00:34:40,460 --> 00:34:43,980
then there are already talks of her deposal.

335
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:07,500
What's wrong? Is something there?

336
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:09,170
No.

337
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,400
Who ordered you?

338
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:54,810
Don't feel wronged. After all, you're not the only one dying.

339
00:35:54,810 --> 00:35:56,410
Did Yeok order this?

340
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:02,920
We'll send you off first and then kill the deposed Queen, Lady Sin, and the rest of your family.

341
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:23,750
Chase him, quickly!

342
00:36:25,340 --> 00:36:28,720
- We can't lose him! Hurry!
- We can't lose him!

343
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:34,790
That way, catch him!

344
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:13,290
  We'll send you off first and then kill the deposed Queen, Lady Sin, and the rest of your family. 

345
00:37:13,290 --> 00:37:17,520
How dare you try to kill them?

346
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:20,740
The First Vice Premier wasn't enough. Now them?

347
00:37:34,370 --> 00:37:37,300
Your Majesty, you're here.

348
00:37:38,410 --> 00:37:41,330
I've prepared a royal table.

349
00:37:41,330 --> 00:37:45,530
Wow, as expected!

350
00:37:45,530 --> 00:37:48,490
The palace is indeed different.

351
00:37:49,130 --> 00:37:55,660
The Royal Kitchen maids must've been busy since morning.

352
00:37:56,980 --> 00:38:02,320
I sent out the Royal Kitchen maids and prepared this since dawn.

353
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:04,420
You personally made all this?

354
00:38:04,420 --> 00:38:06,300
Yes.

355
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:09,450
Although Nanny did help me quite a bit...

356
00:38:14,630 --> 00:38:19,550
Your Majesty, Your Highness, I apologize but I must taste the food first.

357
00:38:19,550 --> 00:38:22,630
Please wait just a moment.

358
00:38:32,230 --> 00:38:33,520
Queen.

359
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:35,050
Yes, Your Majesty?

360
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:41,030
Oh right. Didn't you say you'd be going to the private residence today?

361
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:42,970
Yes.

362
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:48,330
Yesterday they were lowered into the coffins and today, I will go and tidy up the loose ends.

363
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:51,410
I should be going with you.

364
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,290
As long as your heart comes with me, I'm fine.

365
00:38:57,360 --> 00:39:02,250
Then, I'll at least escort you to the palace gates.

366
00:39:04,380 --> 00:39:07,230
You have to eat before you leave.

367
00:39:10,360 --> 00:39:14,710
You cannot move the side dishes out of order.

368
00:39:20,260 --> 00:39:24,540
I don't think we can have fun living in the palace.

369
00:39:24,540 --> 00:39:27,400
Don't you think so?

370
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,350
I know, right?

371
00:39:35,640 --> 00:39:38,620
Greetings to Your Highness the Queen.

372
00:39:41,230 --> 00:39:44,640
You should've at least changed your clothes.

373
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:49,370
If you go around in the dragon robe like this, the palace staff will find it burdensome.

374
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:52,070
I wore it on purpose.

375
00:39:52,070 --> 00:39:53,790
Pardon?

376
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:57,290
I am now the King of Joseon.

377
00:39:57,290 --> 00:40:01,580
The person beside me is the Queen of Joseon and my wife.

378
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:05,760
Therefore, do not forget and be cautious.

379
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:09,230
I want to let the entire world know.

380
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:14,960
I want everyone in the palace to know who my beautiful wife is.

381
00:40:19,520 --> 00:40:24,760
Your Majesty, why are you trying so hard?

382
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:29,700
We're together like this.

383
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:32,970
You even became the King.

384
00:40:32,970 --> 00:40:37,270
Even worse than the days of your status as Grand Prince when you had to tremble in fear of death everyday,

385
00:40:37,270 --> 00:40:41,270
why do you look at me with an even more ill-at-ease expression?

386
00:40:42,280 --> 00:40:45,040
Did I?

387
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,920
Are you feeling uneasy around me?

388
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:53,250
Do you fear that I still might resent you

389
00:40:54,020 --> 00:40:57,270
and leave you one day?

390
00:40:57,270 --> 00:41:02,290
If it's not that, then are you afraid that the words I'm saying right now

391
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:08,800
and the expressions I show are all false?

392
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:14,700
It's because I know that this is not the life you want.

393
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:21,840
It seems that I was being ill-at-ease because I know there is nothing you can do as you wish.

394
00:41:24,470 --> 00:41:28,060
I cannot lie that my heart is at ease right now

395
00:41:28,060 --> 00:41:34,130
but please do not be too uneasy or anxious.

396
00:41:42,730 --> 00:41:45,870
I only have you, Your Majesty.

397
00:41:47,010 --> 00:41:52,030
I will stay here.

398
00:41:56,910 --> 00:41:58,520
Alright.

399
00:42:00,190 --> 00:42:03,620
I've waited for those words.

400
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:06,290
Now that I've heard them,

401
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:10,430
my heart is at ease.

402
00:43:10,970 --> 00:43:14,270
 Memorial tablets of Lord Sin Soo Geun and Lady Kwon. 

403
00:43:21,370 --> 00:43:26,910
  Just as I trust and treasure my child Chae Gyeong, 

404
00:43:26,910 --> 00:43:29,840
 I also trust you, Your Majesty. 

405
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:33,810
  If you could tell me what is troubling you, 

406
00:43:33,810 --> 00:43:39,320
  I will do my best to work through it with you. 

407
00:43:40,560 --> 00:43:47,410
  As this happened because you deceived me and did not take full responsibility, you must take responsibility for this. 

408
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:52,200
  I will follow your royal command. 

409
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:08,280
  - Young Lady Chae Gyeong is coming?
- Yes! 

410
00:44:42,320 --> 00:44:46,460
Your Highness, will you truly be okay by yourself?

411
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:52,730
Yeah, there's not much to clean up either. It'll just take a minute.

412
00:44:54,830 --> 00:44:58,920
Nanny, you go to the funeral site and check on the tombs for me.

413
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:02,360
Then, I'll come back soon.

414
00:45:57,550 --> 00:46:00,760
 Memorial Tablet of Lord Sin Soo Geun, First Vice Premier. 

415
00:46:00,760 --> 00:46:03,490
 Memorial Tablet of First Lady Kwon of Andong Clan. 

416
00:46:09,340 --> 00:46:11,080
  What are you doing here?! 

417
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,850
  What do you mean? Did I come where I wasn't supposed to? 

418
00:46:14,850 --> 00:46:19,260
  Are you preparing His Highness the Grand Prince's meals well? 

419
00:46:19,260 --> 00:46:22,770
  You look like you've lost some weight. Is something going on? 

420
00:46:22,770 --> 00:46:24,190
  No, Mother. 

421
00:46:24,190 --> 00:46:29,500
  When you don't have an appetite, you should've at least drank some of that honey water I prepared. 

422
00:46:29,500 --> 00:46:32,290
  The food will get cold! What are you doing instead of eating? 

423
00:46:32,290 --> 00:46:37,450
  She can't eat because she's answering your questions. Who are you blaming right now? 

424
00:46:37,450 --> 00:46:39,710
  Is that so? 

425
00:46:39,710 --> 00:46:44,190
  What can I do? Regardless of how many questions I ask, I'm still curious. 

426
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:02,480
Your Highness!

427
00:47:02,480 --> 00:47:04,700
You're safe?

428
00:47:05,820 --> 00:47:11,040
Didn't I warn you that when Yeok becomes King, you'll—

429
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:14,870
you'll become miserable.

430
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,660
Your Highness!

431
00:47:34,360 --> 00:47:37,450
 Memorial Tablet of Lord Sin Soo Geun  and First Lady Kwon of Andong Clan.  

432
00:47:37,450 --> 00:47:42,300
Your Majesty, the Chief of Royal Guards seeks an attendance with Your Majesty.

433
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:52,430
Your Majesty, the dethroned King Yeonsangun escaped on his way to exile.

434
00:47:52,430 --> 00:47:55,190
What are you talking about? Escape?!

435
00:47:59,630 --> 00:48:03,060
If you do not want your heads to roll, move aside immediately!

436
00:48:12,000 --> 00:48:14,890
Why did you run away so recklessly?

437
00:48:14,890 --> 00:48:19,170
Escaping on your way to exile is a grave crime. It's a crime worthy of death!

438
00:48:19,170 --> 00:48:21,010
I was ambushed.

439
00:48:21,010 --> 00:48:26,050
They tried to kill me. They're trying to kill my entire family.

440
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:28,620
Kill? Who?

441
00:48:28,620 --> 00:48:34,860
Isn't it obvious? It must be Yeok and his supporters.

442
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:37,930
People who can only sleep comfortably after I'm dead.

443
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:40,880
Do you think I'm the only one?

444
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:45,880
They threatened to kill you, the Queen, and my children

445
00:48:45,880 --> 00:48:48,600
as if they were saying it for me to hear.

446
00:48:53,890 --> 00:48:55,790
It was a trap.

447
00:48:55,790 --> 00:48:59,210
Traitors are hiding in here! You must find them!

448
00:48:59,210 --> 00:49:00,400
Search!

449
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:02,200
Yes, sir!

450
00:49:11,950 --> 00:49:13,690
Follow me.

451
00:49:20,180 --> 00:49:24,630
When I heard that the First Vice Premier had died, I wasn't in my right state of mind.

452
00:49:24,630 --> 00:49:30,700
I lost my reasoning and as a result, I fell into this obvious trap.

453
00:49:31,430 --> 00:49:35,080
I heard that there are already requests for your deposal.

454
00:49:35,080 --> 00:49:39,480
They'll only stop after I'm dead and you're cast out.

455
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:44,490
They would do anything to strip away any future trouble.

456
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:47,180
They must be hiding in here!

457
00:49:47,180 --> 00:49:48,680
Search thoroughly!

458
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:50,360
Yes, sir!

459
00:49:56,660 --> 00:49:58,910
If you leave through the back door, there should be a horse.

460
00:49:58,910 --> 00:50:01,650
Run away and return to your exile!

461
00:50:01,650 --> 00:50:04,470
What about you? What will you do?

462
00:50:04,470 --> 00:50:09,770
For everyone to survive, you must get out of here safely.

463
00:50:21,720 --> 00:50:23,770
What do you think you're doing?!

464
00:50:23,770 --> 00:50:29,610
Your Highness the Queen, the exiled Yeonsangun killed all of his soldiers and ran away.

465
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:35,400
Someone saw him run in here so we are investigating.  Please cooperate.

466
00:50:35,430 --> 00:50:37,520
Aside from me, no one else is in this house.

467
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:42,300
If you get caught hiding a traitor, you will also become an accomplice.

468
00:50:42,300 --> 00:50:45,420
Will you be alright with that?

469
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:46,770
What are you doing?

470
00:50:46,770 --> 00:50:51,170
Stop! This is the mortuary of the deceased.  You cannot enter further.

471
00:50:51,170 --> 00:50:53,160
Search!

472
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:05,450
Move aside! If you want to save the Queen, move aside!

473
00:51:05,450 --> 00:51:06,770
Do not move aside!

474
00:51:06,770 --> 00:51:10,890
The dethroned King and the Queen are working together! The Queen hid the dethroned King!

475
00:51:10,890 --> 00:51:15,610
Let's see if you'll be saying the same thing after the Queen's head rolls off, Deputy Commander.

476
00:51:27,480 --> 00:51:29,260
Catch them!

477
00:51:32,570 --> 00:51:33,590
Come with me.

478
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,620
I can't.

479
00:51:34,620 --> 00:51:37,650
He's trying to kill you, not me!

480
00:51:37,650 --> 00:51:40,860
This is a trap to kill you!

481
00:51:43,520 --> 00:51:44,790
There's no time to hesitate.

482
00:51:44,790 --> 00:51:47,770
They won't be able to kill me that easily. Leave now!

483
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:49,710
Hurry!

484
00:51:55,250 --> 00:51:56,630
The criminal is escaping!

485
00:51:56,630 --> 00:52:00,130
Shoot! Shoot!

486
00:52:02,980 --> 00:52:05,580
Chase him!

487
00:52:27,060 --> 00:52:30,080
The dethroned King is definitely somewhere here! Search!

488
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:31,910
Yes, sir!

489
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:24,950
You will soon be escorted to the palace.

490
00:53:24,950 --> 00:53:28,360
Do you plan to annihilate my entire family?

491
00:53:30,080 --> 00:53:33,130
His Majesty will not tolerate this.

492
00:53:33,130 --> 00:53:35,910
Of course, he won't.

493
00:53:35,910 --> 00:53:39,390
But do you think we would have made our move without that simple calculation?

494
00:53:39,390 --> 00:53:42,280
While you remained in the Royal Villa,

495
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:45,180
the dethroned King enjoyed visiting the Villa more than

496
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:48,900
visiting the quarters of the royal concubines.

497
00:53:48,900 --> 00:53:54,230
The Snail Brides will write that content on posters and spread it to the world.

498
00:53:54,230 --> 00:53:59,230
"The Queen and the dethroned King had intimate relations."

499
00:54:00,790 --> 00:54:03,320
On top of that, he was your uncle-in-law.

500
00:54:03,320 --> 00:54:07,180
Shut up! Do you think anyone will believe those baseless rumors?!

501
00:54:07,180 --> 00:54:09,300
Whether they're baseless rumors or the truth,

502
00:54:09,300 --> 00:54:14,040
we'll know what people believe after we spread the news.

503
00:54:14,040 --> 00:54:18,670
For what? Why do you stoop so low?

504
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:22,780
If you confess, then we will not spread the news

505
00:54:22,780 --> 00:54:26,080
and end it with your sole crime being allowing a traitor escape.

506
00:54:26,080 --> 00:54:29,560
Wouldn't that be better for His Majesty too?

507
00:54:29,560 --> 00:54:34,140
He wouldn't be swirled into dirty rumors regarding his brother the dethroned King and his wife

508
00:54:34,140 --> 00:54:37,840
at the start of his reign.

509
00:54:38,460 --> 00:54:40,460
Don't you think so?

510
00:54:54,350 --> 00:54:56,510
We greet you, Your Majesty.

511
00:54:56,510 --> 00:54:58,040
Where is the dethroned King?

512
00:54:58,040 --> 00:55:02,920
We lost him but I've ordered soldiers to scout the area

513
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:04,980
so he will be captured soon.

514
00:55:04,980 --> 00:55:09,700
Then capture the dethroned King. The Queen is only a victim!

515
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,840
Even if she is, I believe we must escort Her Highness here to this council meeting

516
00:55:13,840 --> 00:55:18,130
and directly hear her story in front of these many ministers.

517
00:55:18,130 --> 00:55:20,590
Are you saying we should—

518
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:24,960
Are you saying we should publicly interrogate the Queen?

519
00:55:26,130 --> 00:55:29,970
If she is innocent, then don't you think

520
00:55:29,970 --> 00:55:35,430
we should reveal her innocence to dispose of any assumptions and misunderstandings?

521
00:55:35,990 --> 00:55:39,720
Please understand!

522
00:55:46,270 --> 00:55:51,560
Escape?! Did the dethroned King truly run away?

523
00:55:51,560 --> 00:55:52,830
Yes, Your Highness the Queen Dowager.

524
00:55:52,830 --> 00:55:56,780
Her Highness the Queen helped the dethroned King escape

525
00:55:56,780 --> 00:56:00,120
and was just brought back to the palace by soldiers.

526
00:56:01,120 --> 00:56:02,980
Your Highness the Queen Dowager!

527
00:56:03,800 --> 00:56:08,690
In the end, that child has stirred trouble!

528
00:56:09,180 --> 00:56:12,260
  He's trying to kill you, not me! 

529
00:56:12,260 --> 00:56:15,310
  This is a trap set to kill you! 

530
00:56:22,540 --> 00:56:24,220
Queen.

531
00:56:24,220 --> 00:56:25,960
Your Majesty.

532
00:56:28,080 --> 00:56:33,660
Your Highness, I'll ask an intrusive question.

533
00:56:33,660 --> 00:56:35,930
You're aware of the fact that while the dethroned Yeonsangun was on his path to exile,

534
00:56:35,930 --> 00:56:39,960
he harmed his soldiers and escaped, correct?

535
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:44,060
Yes.

536
00:56:47,510 --> 00:56:51,820
Then who helped the dethroned King escape?

537
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:56,050
By any chance, was it you, Your Highness the Queen?

538
00:56:56,050 --> 00:56:59,200
The Queen only went to her private home to fulfill her duties as her parents' child!

539
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:01,560
How could she have gone there with knowledge of the dethroned King's escape?!

540
00:57:01,560 --> 00:57:05,810
Then at the time Her Highness went to visit her private home,

541
00:57:05,810 --> 00:57:08,840
the dethroned King hid in the First Vice Premier's home;

542
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:13,710
was the meeting all a coincidence?

543
00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:18,960
As if Her Highness had kindly treated the injured dethroned King,

544
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:22,620
there were bloodied bandages and medicinal herbs in the room.

545
00:57:29,330 --> 00:57:32,660
Where is your ridiculous imagination coming from?!

546
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:36,660
I'm sorry to tell you this, but it is not just my imagination.

547
00:57:36,660 --> 00:57:39,860
Scandalous rumors regarding Her Highness and the dethroned King

548
00:57:39,860 --> 00:57:42,100
are already abundant inside and outside of the palace walls.

549
00:57:42,100 --> 00:57:44,350
Rumors?

550
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:49,060
The Queen, since the year of wood rat (1504), while held as hostage in the palace...

551
00:57:49,060 --> 00:57:51,110
Shut that mouth!

552
00:57:56,320 --> 00:57:58,660
Do you truly wish to die?

553
00:57:58,660 --> 00:58:01,710
Your Majesty, please calm down!

554
00:58:01,710 --> 00:58:05,390
Please reconsider!

555
00:58:20,180 --> 00:58:24,700
His words are correct, Your Majesty.

556
00:58:34,960 --> 00:58:40,570
I helped the dethroned King escape.

557
00:58:56,310 --> 00:59:01,310
Chae Gyeong, it's dangerous! Escape now!

558
00:59:05,920 --> 00:59:09,390
Queen, what are you talking about?

559
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:17,570
Then, did you think I would remain still after seeing my parents' tragic death?

560
00:59:18,830 --> 00:59:22,720
Did you think I would forgive my mortal enemy so easily and live as if I were dead?

561
00:59:26,380 --> 00:59:30,450
You must've thought that you could use this chance to crown me Queen and if not,

562
00:59:30,450 --> 00:59:36,250
you could comfort my heart well,

563
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,680
but you were wrong.

564
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,810
No matter how much you tried to console and comfort my heart, it was all useless.

565
00:59:45,810 --> 00:59:51,540
Rather, only my anger and resentment grew.

566
00:59:52,860 --> 00:59:56,620
"Ah, because in front of you,

567
00:59:56,620 --> 00:59:58,650
I always fall easily and am deceived easily,

568
00:59:58,650 --> 01:00:03,580
because I'm a foolish woman, because I'm an easy target,

569
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:08,460
you wouldn't have worried too much even after you killed my parents."

570
01:00:08,460 --> 01:00:10,630
I only grew more pathetic.

571
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:13,680
  Chae Gyeong, it's dangerous. Stop. 

572
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:17,050
I wanted to show that I wasn't an easy person to deal with.

573
01:00:17,050 --> 01:00:20,010
I wanted to show you who you all killed so mercilessly

574
01:00:20,010 --> 01:00:26,840
so yes, I helped the dethroned King escape.

575
01:00:28,510 --> 01:00:32,570
Stop... stop it.

576
01:00:33,800 --> 01:00:39,470
  No, it's time to untie the convoluted situations. 

577
01:00:46,740 --> 01:00:55,690
To my parents, to me... there is only one liege.

578
01:01:03,510 --> 01:01:11,070
I have never sworn to serve you as my ruler.

579
01:01:16,850 --> 01:01:19,030
You wench!

580
01:01:23,740 --> 01:01:26,760
Your Majesty, what are you doing?

581
01:01:26,760 --> 01:01:31,900
Are you just going to remain still when such insolent words are coming out of this wench's mouth?!

582
01:01:31,900 --> 01:01:33,020
Royal Mother.

583
01:01:33,020 --> 01:01:35,590
She confessed her identity as a traitor.

584
01:01:35,590 --> 01:01:41,180
I can no longer listen to this wench's words that ridicule the Royal Family and the Royal Court

585
01:01:41,180 --> 01:01:43,760
and scorn you, Your Majesty!

586
01:01:43,760 --> 01:01:47,900
She dared to help the dethroned King escape and regain the royal authority!

587
01:01:47,900 --> 01:01:50,250
Let's not get ahead of ourselves. It's not like that.

588
01:01:50,250 --> 01:01:53,120
Look here! Escort the Queen back to her room—

589
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:57,920
You can't, Your Majesty! She committed a crime worthy of death.

590
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:01,790
We have to use this wench as an example and ensure that nothing like this happens again.

591
01:02:01,790 --> 01:02:05,200
We must restore the Royal Family's fallen honor!

592
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:08,390
Execute her.

593
01:02:08,390 --> 01:02:10,010
Royal Mother!

594
01:02:10,010 --> 01:02:12,900
Please understand!

595
01:02:12,900 --> 01:02:16,400
How could she help the dethroned King escape? That's undeniable treason!

596
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:20,140
Please understand, Your Majesty!

597
01:02:20,140 --> 01:02:25,170
May you remove any future disaster and steady the royal family and nation.

598
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:28,280
Please understand!

599
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:32,120
Please understand!

600
01:02:32,120 --> 01:02:37,440
  We end here, Your Majesty. 

601
01:02:38,330 --> 01:02:46,190


602
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:53,920
♫   I want to hold you, the one whose brilliance chills my heart   ♫

603
01:02:53,920 --> 01:02:57,700
♫   I'm afraid you might fly away   ♫

604
01:02:57,700 --> 01:03:00,600
  Queen for Seven Days  

605
01:03:00,600 --> 01:03:04,690
  For the Royal Family and the Royal Court, you must depose the Queen! 

606
01:03:04,690 --> 01:03:09,150
  Didn't we agree to protect our love by not being together? 

607
01:03:09,150 --> 01:03:11,750
  Do you truly wish for me to leave like this? 

608
01:03:11,750 --> 01:03:15,590
  Husband! Your Highness the Grand Prince! Husband! 

609
01:03:15,590 --> 01:03:18,120
  You must deliver this message. 

610
01:03:18,120 --> 01:03:19,400
  Who?! Why?! 

611
01:03:19,400 --> 01:03:21,770
 I will regard it as an offense of disparaging the king 

612
01:03:21,770 --> 01:03:25,200
  and punish you with the crime of treason, the execution of 3 generations!  

613
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:28,330
  You knew that our fates shouldn't have crossed. 

614
01:03:28,330 --> 01:03:35,300
  Since we've already met and fallen in love, I wish to protect that love through death. 

615
01:03:35,300 --> 01:03:36,600
♫    Saying I love you without saying the words   ♫
