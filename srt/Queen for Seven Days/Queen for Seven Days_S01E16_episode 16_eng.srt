1
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:48,260
This is the evidence showing that the Snail Brides is a traitorous group.

2
00:00:53,250 --> 00:00:56,930
  The person who should be the real king is Grand Prince Jin Seong. 

3
00:00:56,930 --> 00:00:59,890
 The late king left a will. 

4
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:09,030
Have you really betrayed me?

5
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:10,700
Your Majesty.

6
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,470
Father.

7
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,870
Your Majesty.

8
00:01:15,870 --> 00:01:20,870
Then as promised, I have to take your life.

9
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:24,140
Not only your life.

10
00:01:24,140 --> 00:01:28,880
I will kill both you and your wife.

11
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,380
Of course, Chae Gyeong will be the first one to die.

12
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:42,200
Your Majesty, my daughter has nothing to do with this.

13
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:46,420
Please, let her go.

14
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,750
No, I will stay with you.

15
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:52,720
Your Majesty!

16
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:07,220


17
00:02:20,430 --> 00:02:23,650
I have shown mercy to Chae Gyeong.

18
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,990
  Episode 16   
 It's your turn now.

19
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:28,560
I will ask once again.

20
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:33,060
Did you really just let Grand Prince Jin Seong go?

21
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:36,240
Your Majesty. I am

22
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,320
being unfairly treated.

23
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,350
It's true that I personally investigated the Snail Brides

24
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:48,840
and discovered their hideout.

25
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,210
But, there were many possible locations of their headquarters, more than I expected.

26
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:56,550
Thus, I only delayed in reporting this to you because I planned to round them up at once after finding out the exact location,

27
00:02:56,550 --> 00:02:59,480
the number of people involved, and the group of leaders.

28
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,640
I did not have the slightest intention to deceive you.

29
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:09,290
However, it was my mistake in failing to guard against the person

30
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:13,580
who tried to somehow find a fault with me

31
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:18,020
in order to frame me to be a criminal.

32
00:03:18,020 --> 00:03:25,060
Your Majesty. The First Vice Premier is trying to make excuses.

33
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:30,190
Where are these other hideouts of the Snail Brides located exactly?

34
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,190
Give me a map of the capital. I will mark it for you.

35
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:39,290
Bring it.

36
00:03:39,290 --> 00:03:40,620
Yes.

37
00:03:46,830 --> 00:03:50,210
  Search Im Sa Hong's vacation home.  

38
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:56,480
  Then afterwards, search empty civilian houses in Hoyeon-bang and Yeonhwa-bang, neighborhoods planned to be demolished.  

39
00:03:57,210 --> 00:04:01,480
  By now, my gang will be setting up the Snail Bride's locations everywhere.  

40
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:03,330
 If we could even stall for two hours,  

41
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:06,930
  the Snail Brides' hideouts will be created all over the capital.  

42
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,920
We carried out your orders.

43
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:12,900
You've worked hard.

44
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:19,860
  If you want to undo all the wrong you have done up till now,  

45
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:22,970
  do as I tell you.  

46
00:04:22,970 --> 00:04:24,330
  How?  

47
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:27,370
  We have to get rid of the evidence that the pawn shop was the Snail Brides' hideout.  

48
00:04:27,370 --> 00:04:34,180
  Or we have to turn many locations within the capital into the Snail Brides' hideouts.  

49
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:39,190
  Merchant Group Transaction History  

50
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:42,470
  Confidential Private Lives in the Capital, Court Official's Current Assets.  

51
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:46,030
We followed the First Vice Premier's markings on the map,

52
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:51,870
items presumed to belong to the Snail Brides have been discovered in many of those locations.

53
00:04:52,510 --> 00:04:56,160
Especially, in the storage of the mansion in Doomoon-po,

54
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,410
the much rumored ledger recording government officials corruption has been discovered.

55
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:03,960
So the First Vice Premier was telling the truth.

56
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:08,160
Who's the owner of the Doomoon-po storage?

57
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,170
That is—

58
00:05:11,710 --> 00:05:14,490
It's the Chief Royal Secretary.

59
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:24,700
That's impossible. It's a set up to malign me ...

60
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,880
It's the same for me.

61
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,050
To catch the Snail Brides, that exists in name only and has vanished,

62
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:37,090
anyone can plant fabricated evidence.

63
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:42,780
It's possible to kill one person instantly by

64
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,440
accusing him of being a traitor without any clear evidence.

65
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:58,630
The bulletins posted by the Snail Brides

66
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,200
always have their seal on them.

67
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:02,550
What is the reason

68
00:06:02,550 --> 00:06:06,000
for leaving the seal and the snail shells each time?

69
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:12,050
Their only goal is to have their existence known to the people.

70
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:19,930
This bulletin doesn't have any symbol on it.

71
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,350
Then,

72
00:06:21,350 --> 00:06:24,490
your'e saying that secret room isn't the Snail Brides' hideout?

73
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:26,340
If that place is the Snail Brides' hideout,

74
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:29,580
your house will also be the Snail Brides' hideout.

75
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:33,550
From where to whom do you have to shake up?

76
00:06:33,550 --> 00:06:36,960
Your Majesty, you must not listen to the First Vice Premier's words.

77
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,540
I don't want to listen to either one of you.

78
00:06:40,790 --> 00:06:45,800
You said the evidence you discovered today isn't conclusive.

79
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,410
Then, continue until you find conclusive evidence.

80
00:06:49,410 --> 00:06:56,270
I will wait for you once more until then.

81
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:11,480
Where is the Deputy Commander?

82
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:23,780
How can you use such a low move?

83
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:26,710
I think there is a misunderstanding, Your Highness.

84
00:07:26,710 --> 00:07:28,860
A misunderstanding?

85
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:32,310
I heard everything from Myung Hye and you're saying it's a misunderstanding?

86
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:38,620
What kind of ruler do you wish for?

87
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:44,970
Is it alright as long as you are safe by using the lives of others as a sword and a shield?

88
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,590
I don't want to become a king by going that far.

89
00:07:50,590 --> 00:07:54,840
Your Highness. That's what politics and the throne are.

90
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,920
If you experience the world a little more,

91
00:07:56,920 --> 00:08:00,420
you will come to realize there are some things that can't be achieved with

92
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:02,110
passion, heroism, and principles alone.

93
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:06,260
What's the point of having a throne if beliefs and principles collapse?

94
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:09,640
The ruler will be nothing more than a tyrant.

95
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:15,470
Disband the Snail Brides immediately!

96
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:21,420
Take special care so everyone can return to their livelihood

97
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:25,280
and not one person would be sacrificed.

98
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:42,580
I caused a scene in front of guests.

99
00:08:42,580 --> 00:08:44,740
It's alright.

100
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:50,390
However, the Grand Prince is exactly the same as when he was a child and had an argument with the king in the royal palace.

101
00:08:50,390 --> 00:08:55,360
It was impressive when he would say what's on his mind without backing down.

102
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,460
Like how he was before, he is still too idealistic.

103
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,710
But aren't you proud of him?

104
00:09:00,710 --> 00:09:05,450
To still have such principles despite going through many life-threatening experiences.

105
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:10,990
The late king must have seen through Grand Prince Jin Seong's character.

106
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:27,770
  Seung Myeong Pae: a badge symbolizing obedience to the royal command  

107
00:09:35,610 --> 00:09:37,230
My lord.

108
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:40,140
Are you alright, Father?

109
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,780
What happened?

110
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:43,680
Why were you captured?

111
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,840
You don't need to worry about it. There was a misunderstanding.

112
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:56,480
Thanks to the Grand Prince's quick response, I was able to turn it around.

113
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,090
The Grand Prince?

114
00:09:59,090 --> 00:10:03,730
I have committed a grave sin towards the king that can't be forgiven.

115
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:08,830
I reported falsely, something I shouldn't do as his subject.

116
00:10:08,830 --> 00:10:11,990
It was to save your marriage.

117
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:16,070
As a premier of the nation, releasing a criminal based on personal feelings,

118
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:18,680
deserves to be criticized.

119
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:22,190
I'm sorry, Father.

120
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:25,980
Now, to pay for this crime,

121
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:29,570
staying by His Majesty's side, I will give it my all

122
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:34,130
to look after his heart and to right the state affairs.

123
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:39,420
It seems like there is nothing more I can do as your father.

124
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:43,340
From now on, follow Grand Prince Jin Seong's wishes

125
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:45,940
and live only as his wife.

126
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:50,330
I don't want to. Before I am the Grand Prince's wife,

127
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:52,120
I am my mother and father's daughter.

128
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:53,640
Now, you are not.

129
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:59,350
As long as you are married to the Grand Prince, you can't survive unless you become cold and cruel.

130
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:04,510
Even if that means ending your relationship with your parents.

131
00:11:04,510 --> 00:11:07,130
That is also your fate.

132
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,890
Father.

133
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:17,250
Now, hurry and leave.

134
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:21,950
And, no matter what happens, do not return.

135
00:11:21,950 --> 00:11:27,250
That is for the sake of you, the Grand Prince, the King,

136
00:11:28,650 --> 00:11:30,980
and for our family.

137
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:48,120
 Hurry and run away. Do not return here again. 

138
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:52,470
 Take Chae Gyeong and run away as fast as possible. 

139
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:12,960
Did something happen to you? Where did you go?

140
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:18,060
Did you hear the news of Father-in-law? If not—

141
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:23,700
Let's take it step by step. I am here now.

142
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:37,810
He already gave his permission?

143
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,630
Is Father-in-law alright?

144
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:42,530
Yes.

145
00:12:42,530 --> 00:12:46,970
He was able to avoid the crisis thanks to you.

146
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:51,880
It's not thanks to me, but thanks to your father that we are safe.

147
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,180
He nearly suffered greatly.

148
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:57,650
I was scared as well.

149
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,740
I'm sorry.

150
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:04,090
Isn't it all over now?

151
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:10,260
Father has told me to leave as quickly as possible and to never return to the capital.

152
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:14,870
Alright. The Snail Brides are going to disband.

153
00:13:14,870 --> 00:13:20,490
If I am out of his sight, Hyungnim will be more at ease.

154
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:22,800
Everything will go back to normal.

155
00:13:22,800 --> 00:13:28,170
We do not have time to chat like this right now. There is a lot to be done if we are going to leave.

156
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:41,280
  Until their leader shows up,  

157
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,830
 how about beheading ten Snail Brides every day? 

158
00:13:43,830 --> 00:13:48,510
 But Your Majesty, we do not know the identity of the Snail Brides. 

159
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:52,440
 Those who received the rice given out by the Snail Brides all belong to that gang. 

160
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:56,110
 Your Majesty! Please reconsider this! 

161
00:13:56,110 --> 00:14:00,100
 They are just innocent citizens. 

162
00:14:00,100 --> 00:14:05,540
 Innocent, you say? Can you accept responsibility that 

163
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,800
 those subjects who received help from the traitors  will not have an iota of traitorous intent? 

164
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:14,530
 If you go through 10 civilian houses in the capital, 

165
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:19,060
 at least half of them must have received rice from the Snail Brides. 

166
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:24,420
 It won't be hard to catch the Snail Brides' accomplice. 

167
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:43,550
There are lots of fabrics like this in my parents' storage.

168
00:14:43,550 --> 00:14:46,350
I brought a little while I was there.

169
00:14:46,350 --> 00:14:48,180
A little?

170
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:57,840
What are you doing right now?

171
00:14:57,840 --> 00:15:00,350
I am acting like a husband.

172
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:03,660
Then you should've helped me carry this earlier.

173
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,000
Ah. It's alright. Since you are upright, stand straight please.

174
00:15:10,620 --> 00:15:12,500
What are you doing?

175
00:15:13,230 --> 00:15:16,260
Are we not going on a long trip?

176
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:19,610
I thought you would need another pair of comfortable clothes.

177
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,090
I said let's leave at daybreak tomorrow.

178
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,700
Do not worry. I can spend the night to make it.

179
00:15:23,700 --> 00:15:26,600
I think what you make might be unwearable.

180
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:34,660
♫  Because you came a step closer  ♫

181
00:15:35,570 --> 00:15:40,490
♫  My heart is pounding  ♫

182
00:15:42,010 --> 00:15:45,040
Hey.

183
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:49,660
If you look in my closet, you will see that I have a lot of clothes.

184
00:15:49,660 --> 00:15:52,550
You could take out one of them and spread it out

185
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:56,800
to take measurements. Do you have to do this?

186
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:01,840
Grand Prince, you are very smart.

187
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:05,640
Did you not know that? I don't think so.

188
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:06,900
Pardon?

189
00:16:06,900 --> 00:16:10,280
Seeing you do this despite knowing how smart I am.

190
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,410
I am not!

191
00:16:11,410 --> 00:16:15,240
- What did I say to make you say that you are not? 
 - I really am not.

192
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,560
Okay. I believe you.

193
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:30,400
♫  It's just growing slowly  ♫

194
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:36,920
Memorize me like this. I am about 1 pyeong taller than you.

195
00:16:36,920 --> 00:16:40,130
♫  Your breath which comes whispering to me  ♫

196
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:43,610
My sleeves are about half palm's length longer than you.

197
00:16:49,140 --> 00:16:52,850
My width is about two palms bigger than you.

198
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:56,680
Just as your cooking is the best to me even though it isn't the best,

199
00:16:56,680 --> 00:17:02,430
the clothes you make will be the best in the world even if your measurements are off.

200
00:17:02,430 --> 00:17:06,940
Even if it is a little short or long

201
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:08,830
I will wear it without any complaints.

202
00:17:08,830 --> 00:17:12,360
You're quite clever indeed.

203
00:17:12,360 --> 00:17:15,430
I feel accomplished.

204
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,710
Yes.

205
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:56,390
Hey. Have you heard about the secret order?

206
00:17:56,390 --> 00:17:59,170
Are you talking about the late King's will?

207
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,140
 When the Grand Prince becomes an adult, give him the throne. 

208
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,400
Your...

209
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:16,770
Your Majesty!

210
00:18:21,010 --> 00:18:24,440
Your Majesty, please spare us.

211
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:52,490
Your Majesty. Did you spend the night at the library again?

212
00:18:55,920 --> 00:19:01,100
Why do I keep hearing strange things?

213
00:19:01,100 --> 00:19:04,800
Your Majesty, it will scar.

214
00:19:04,800 --> 00:19:10,000
Have you also seen the secret order?

215
00:19:10,040 --> 00:19:12,470
The secret order?

216
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:17,050
To abdicate the throne to Grand Prince Jin Seong once he reaches adulthood.

217
00:19:17,050 --> 00:19:22,660
Why would Father leave something like that behind? Why?

218
00:19:22,660 --> 00:19:26,500
What am I lacking? Don't you agree?

219
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,420
Yes, Your Majesty. It is just talk—

220
00:19:30,420 --> 00:19:35,560
But then, do you know why I hear such things?

221
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:45,530
It is because my mother

222
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:50,240
is a deposed queen.

223
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:55,730
Because my mother was a deposed queen, they look down on me too.

224
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:02,930
Besides, even my father couldn't trust me and left a secret order.

225
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:05,080
The secret order.

226
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:09,630
Did you just say the secret order?

227
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:15,100
Your Majesty, please drink some water—

228
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:22,170
Who made me like this? Who were the people that deposed my mother?

229
00:20:22,170 --> 00:20:26,740
Call for the Chief Royal Secretary right now. I have to ask him myself!

230
00:20:28,340 --> 00:20:29,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

231
00:20:31,240 --> 00:20:33,300
The issue of deposed queen?

232
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:39,140
Yes. It's a perfect chance to regain the King's trust.

233
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:45,630
Many will be killed over this.

234
00:20:51,250 --> 00:20:53,520
We will leave now.

235
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:31,140
  From now on, follow the Grand Prince Jin Seong's wishes and live only as his wife. 

236
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:34,540
 Even if it means you must end your relationship with your parents. 

237
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:37,640
 That is also your fate. 

238
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:48,900
Let's leave behind all the pain and sadness here.

239
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:29,040
 What are you doing? 

240
00:22:31,060 --> 00:22:32,220
 It's nothing. 

241
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:34,220
  The person who should be the real king is Grand Prince Jin Seong. The late king left a will. 

242
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:38,140
  Hyungnim, don't place our belongings outside. Something is strange. 

243
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:41,530
  Here, there are letters that claim we plotted treason. 

244
00:22:41,530 --> 00:22:43,680
  If we make one wrong move and get caught, 

245
00:22:43,680 --> 00:22:46,290
  our entire organization will be wiped out. Understand? 

246
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,380
It's this house! Drag out the Snail Brides!

247
00:22:50,380 --> 00:22:52,410
W-we aren't the Snail Brides!

248
00:22:52,410 --> 00:22:53,560
M-My Lord, why are you doing this?!

249
00:22:53,560 --> 00:22:56,800
My Lord, why are you doing this to us?!

250
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,170
Why are you being like this, sir?

251
00:22:59,170 --> 00:23:00,840
I have not done anything wrong.

252
00:23:00,840 --> 00:23:01,970
We're not the Snail Brides!

253
00:23:01,970 --> 00:23:03,050
You took the rice from them?

254
00:23:03,050 --> 00:23:04,850
What are you talking about?!

255
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:07,390
My Lord, please spare us!

256
00:23:07,390 --> 00:23:09,800
We were wronged! My Lord!

257
00:23:09,800 --> 00:23:11,720
I've done nothing wrong! My Lord, I've been wronged!

258
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:12,990
You've committed a grave crime!

259
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:14,930
Why are you talking so much?!

260
00:23:14,930 --> 00:23:17,850
- My Lord, please spare us! 
 - Please spare us!

261
00:23:23,690 --> 00:23:28,680
- What's going on? 
 - They suddenly barged in and called us traitors!

262
00:23:28,680 --> 00:23:31,050
Quickly! This way!

263
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:36,590
- What's wrong with you?! Let go of me! 
 - What's going on?!

264
00:23:36,590 --> 00:23:39,710
- I'm innocent! I'm innocent! 
 - Let go of me!

265
00:23:39,710 --> 00:23:41,850
Please spare me!

266
00:23:41,850 --> 00:23:43,030
He's a Pawn Shop regular.

267
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:47,610
- No, stop! You can't take him! Stop! 
 - No, don't come! Don't follow!

268
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:49,210
Let's save him.

269
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:51,060
Wait!

270
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:55,110
We have to be careful. This is Sin Soo Geun's plan to lure us out of hiding.

271
00:23:55,110 --> 00:23:57,330
I knew this would happen.

272
00:23:57,330 --> 00:24:00,200
They say there is not a single minister who can be trusted.

273
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:03,310
I knew that the First Vice Premier would stab us in the back.

274
00:24:03,310 --> 00:24:06,990
Regardless of how much Yeok had stopped us, we should have killed Sin Soo Geun back then. Don't you think?

275
00:24:06,990 --> 00:24:10,090
- Stop! No! 
 - Let go of me! Don't touch her!

276
00:24:10,090 --> 00:24:13,790
Restrain yourself, restrain yourself.

277
00:24:13,790 --> 00:24:15,920
Let's go.

278
00:24:19,470 --> 00:24:21,050
First Vice Premier.

279
00:24:21,050 --> 00:24:22,900
This is a royal command.

280
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,510
A mop-out order for the Snail Brides will be handed down

281
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:31,120
so starting from tonight, prohibit anyone from entering or leaving the capital gates.

282
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,550
Only those who have a pass issued from the palace

283
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,420
will be allowed to enter and leave the capital as they wish.

284
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:37,490
If you do that, the people's livelihood will be blocked

285
00:24:37,490 --> 00:24:39,580
and cause a stir among the people.

286
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:43,340
How about carry out the inspection but allow entry and exit?

287
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:47,380
While this happens, there will be criminals who sneak through.

288
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,660
Until they are rounded up and captured,

289
00:24:49,660 --> 00:24:52,610
you will have to bear the inconvenience.

290
00:24:57,150 --> 00:25:00,920
- Let us rest here for a bit. 
 - Yes.

291
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:07,090
Aren't you tired?

292
00:25:07,090 --> 00:25:10,490
I am alright. How about you,  Grand Prince?

293
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:16,140
But, why do you not whistle these days?

294
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:18,710
It's been quite a while since I've stopped

295
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:23,460
because when I whistle, I think of you.

296
00:25:25,670 --> 00:25:28,930
Do you know how I survived?

297
00:25:28,930 --> 00:25:29,860
That...

298
00:25:29,900 --> 00:25:35,100
  Then you must also know that the person who saved Yeok is a woman. 

299
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:37,480
I'm sure you survived on your own.

300
00:25:39,550 --> 00:25:41,820
You saved me.

301
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:47,060
Your whistle saved me.

302
00:25:47,060 --> 00:25:49,850
Even when I was on the verge of death,

303
00:25:51,700 --> 00:25:54,780
I was whistling

304
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:57,410
and Myeong Hye heard that sound.

305
00:25:58,550 --> 00:26:02,060
Although Myeong Hye was the one who healed my body,

306
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,840
ultimately, the person who saved me

307
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:10,390
is you.

308
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:15,230
So, don't mind Myeong Hye from now on.

309
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:20,820
I didn't even ask, so why are you suddenly telling me that?

310
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,350
Are you confessing from a guilty conscience or something?

311
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:28,080
I mean, we agreed to not keep secrets and to be truthful to each other.

312
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:31,760
Yet, you never once asked me about that

313
00:26:31,760 --> 00:26:34,170
so I was anxious.

314
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:41,200
To be honest, I was afraid to ask.

315
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,930
I was afraid that she would have

316
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:47,820
done more things for you than I had.

317
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:51,440
I was afraid that she would have been more important to you than I was.

318
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:55,370
That's impossible.

319
00:26:55,370 --> 00:26:59,230
I wanted to tell you again

320
00:26:59,230 --> 00:27:01,260
how I returned alive because of you.

321
00:27:01,260 --> 00:27:03,680
Because those are the words I said when I was cowardly,

322
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:07,790
when I was a liar,

323
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:10,120
I thought that you wouldn't believe them.

324
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:15,280
Yes, your true feelings

325
00:27:15,280 --> 00:27:17,910
are coming out one by one.

326
00:27:29,540 --> 00:27:33,790
- Please spare me! 
 - My Lord!

327
00:27:33,790 --> 00:27:36,820
My Lord, please set us free!

328
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:38,350
Do you know the Snail Brides?

329
00:27:38,350 --> 00:27:41,320
I have heard about the Snail Brides

330
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:42,600
but I have never seen them!

331
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:46,180
- My Lord, please spare me! 
- M-my Lord!

332
00:27:46,180 --> 00:27:48,030
- Please, please spare me! 
 - My Lord!

333
00:27:48,030 --> 00:27:50,400
Be quiet!

334
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:55,890
By any chance, you're not planning to listen to their stories

335
00:27:55,890 --> 00:27:59,120
and release them again, right?

336
00:28:01,730 --> 00:28:04,070
- My Lord! My Lord! 
 - My Lord!

337
00:28:04,070 --> 00:28:07,820
- My Lord! My Lord! 
 - My Lord! My Lord!

338
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:11,250
- My Lord!
 - Please spare me!

339
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:17,730
I'll capture them so you can just proceed with the execution.

340
00:28:19,500 --> 00:28:26,350
Well, there's no need for you to be thankful just because I'm lessening your workload.

341
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:32,000
- My Lord, please spare me! I'm innocent!
 - Please spare me!

342
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:34,260
- Please spare me, please!
 - My Lord!

343
00:28:37,300 --> 00:28:39,430
What do you think you're doing?!

344
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:42,710
If you wanted to cut off your tail, you should have done so properly.

345
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:46,460
In the end, you're planning to kill countless innocent citizens?

346
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:51,370
If the Leader doesn't like that, then I'm sure he'll crawl out from hiding soon.

347
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:02,710
What happened?

348
00:29:02,710 --> 00:29:04,820
Her Highness the Queen Dowager is concerned.

349
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:08,140
We should have cut off our tail properly last time.

350
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,530
Exactly where is Seo No hiding that we can't find a trace of him?

351
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:15,780
Is there no other way?

352
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:18,640
It's a trap meant for the Grand Prince.

353
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:23,210
It will not end until he comes himself.

354
00:29:26,940 --> 00:29:29,030
W-what do you think you're doing?!

355
00:29:29,030 --> 00:29:30,300
W-what are you doing?!

356
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,330
What are you doing?!

357
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:33,520
Let go of me!

358
00:29:35,170 --> 00:29:39,710
The ministers who oppose the restoration of the deposed Queen's tomb:

359
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:43,770
Lee Haeng, Park Gwang Hyung, Gwang Hyung.

360
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:47,510
Those who agreed to the queen's deposing were

361
00:29:47,510 --> 00:29:50,170
Yoon Pil Sang, Han Chi Hyung,

362
00:29:50,170 --> 00:29:52,280
and Han Myung Hye.

363
00:29:52,280 --> 00:29:56,030
Among them, the majority are already dead.

364
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:59,680
Even if they're dead, they must have a grave somewhere.

365
00:29:59,680 --> 00:30:03,020
You want to dig up their grave and behead the corpses?

366
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:08,610
If they've committed a grave crime, they must be punished even in death.

367
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:12,170
Since their descendants must also pay the price in place of their deceased ancestors,

368
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:14,780
flog them or

369
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:18,760
no, just kill them all.

370
00:30:19,990 --> 00:30:24,610
Yes, I'll carry out your command.

371
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:43,280
No, please!

372
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:47,650
- Husband! No, stop!
 - Dad!

373
00:30:47,650 --> 00:30:51,740
- No, don't! Please!
- Stop!

374
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:55,030
Sentence the rebel group, who blinded the people,

375
00:30:55,030 --> 00:30:58,450
to execution according to the law.

376
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:00,720
Proceed with the execution!

377
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,650
- No, no, no!
 - Father!

378
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:17,160
 Hyungnim, look. 

379
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:19,880
 The King will not change. 

380
00:31:29,630 --> 00:31:33,560
Goodness, these are all the side dishes I have.

381
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:36,360
Since a few days ago, the capital gates have been closed

382
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:39,220
so no one, not even the vegetable vendors, can come here

383
00:31:39,220 --> 00:31:40,900
so please just eat this.

384
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,640
The capital gates closed?

385
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,990
I don't know much but it's about some thieves or traitors.

386
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:49,680
A mop-up order has been issued for them.

387
00:31:59,990 --> 00:32:02,100
You must be tired so please go to sleep.

388
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,920
We have a long distance to travel tomorrow.

389
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:06,160
Yes, alright.

390
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:10,680
I'll bring you pajamas. Our luggage should be outside.

391
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,920
I'll get them.

392
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:20,950
- Did you hear the news? 
 - What news?

393
00:32:20,950 --> 00:32:24,480
The capital is capturing all of the Snail Brides and executing them!

394
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,610
I heard that too!

395
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:26,770
What a deed.

396
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:29,080
Yeah.

397
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,660
What the heck?

398
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:37,570
- What? 
 - I can't believe rich men come to places like this.

399
00:32:37,570 --> 00:32:41,560
Among you all, is there anyone who came from the capital?

400
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:45,030
W-why are you asking that?

401
00:32:46,250 --> 00:32:47,810
I want to hear news from the capital.

402
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:49,980
O-Oh goodness, w-what is this?

403
00:32:53,550 --> 00:32:56,760
I was going to take this to our peddler's shack so I brought it.

404
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:59,420
If you're curious, you can read this.

405
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:09,280
  Leader of the Snail Brides, listen. Starting from today, at every 9th hour, 

406
00:33:09,280 --> 00:33:14,150
  anyone who sympathizes with the Snail Brides or received help from the Snail Brides will be executed. 

407
00:33:14,150 --> 00:33:17,470
  The execution will continue until the Leader turns himself in 

408
00:33:17,470 --> 00:33:20,150
  so if you do not want to see your comrades' deaths anymore, 

409
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:25,520
  quickly turn yourself into the Royal Investigative Bureau and pay for your crimes. 

410
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:29,660
It's already been 3 days and they're killing 4-5 people each day,

411
00:33:29,660 --> 00:33:34,290
so dozens of people would have lost their heads by now.

412
00:33:39,270 --> 00:33:43,790
  I don't know much but I heard it's about some thieves or traitors. 

413
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:46,450
  A mop-up order has been issued for them. 

414
00:33:59,150 --> 00:34:01,040
Your Highness.

415
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,560
Yeah, Chae Gyeong.

416
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:08,080
Don't say anything. The answer is no!

417
00:34:08,890 --> 00:34:12,970
This is an affair of the nation. The King and his ministers can take care of the nation's affairs!

418
00:34:12,970 --> 00:34:15,730
Who are we to interfere with the affairs of this nation?

419
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:25,030
I've already taken a look at the land I want us to live in Geochang and I've imagined the house I want us to build.

420
00:34:25,030 --> 00:34:28,880
You just have to believe me and follow.

421
00:34:31,470 --> 00:34:34,490
Your luggage was here.

422
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:36,570
Please change your clothes.

423
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:41,000
I will come in a bit later.

424
00:34:41,000 --> 00:34:42,740
Alright.

425
00:35:33,300 --> 00:35:35,040
  Your Highness, 

426
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:39,620
  I sincerely congratulate you on your marriage. 

427
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:52,210
  I request that you make 3 nieces who look just like Young Lady Chae Gyeong and nothing like you! 

428
00:35:52,210 --> 00:35:55,680
 When the work in the capital becomes stable, we will visit you in Geochang. 

429
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:59,380
 Be prepared to kill a chicken (to cook). 

430
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,450
  Here, Seo No. 

431
00:36:01,450 --> 00:36:09,160
  Hyungnim Nak Cheon, although the paths we walk on have changed, I am still your Seo No. 

432
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:16,920
  I will live with the mindset of bruised young Seo No and die like that.  

433
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:19,550
 When you read this letter, you should be resting in beautiful Geochang...  

434
00:36:22,670 --> 00:36:25,780
Goodness...

435
00:36:43,000 --> 00:36:46,330
  The execution will continue until the Leader turns himself in 

436
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,980
  so if you do not want to see your comrades' death anymore, 

437
00:36:48,980 --> 00:36:54,410
  quickly turn yourself in to the Royal Investigative Bureau and pay for your crimes. 

438
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:03,460
 As long as you're married to the Grand Prince, you cannot survive unless you become cold  and cruel. 

439
00:37:03,460 --> 00:37:06,390
  Regardless of what happens, do not return. 

440
00:37:06,390 --> 00:37:11,920
  That is for the sake of you, the Grand Prince, the King, 

441
00:37:12,730 --> 00:37:15,750
  and our family. 

442
00:37:34,250 --> 00:37:35,730
Who is it?

443
00:37:35,730 --> 00:37:38,450
It's me, Seo No.

444
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:54,340
You're safe.

445
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:57,300
Although I shouldn't be.

446
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:13,790
For the entire organization to clear out safely

447
00:38:13,790 --> 00:38:16,720
and to buy time to plan, I had no other choice

448
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:19,560
but to sacrifice someone.

449
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,240
That's not a bad idea.

450
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:33,060
I would have died as the Leader of the Snail Brides.

451
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,880
I'd rather you get mad.

452
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:38,560
At this point, shouldn't you be threatening to kill me?

453
00:38:38,560 --> 00:38:41,800
Why would I kill you, Young Lady Myeong Hye?

454
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:46,130
Even if I don't kill you, you're already living in hell.

455
00:38:47,540 --> 00:38:49,290
What?

456
00:38:49,290 --> 00:38:51,670
Nothing makes you smile

457
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,210
so living is hell.

458
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,710
Because of that great cause you want,

459
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:03,660
you'll live a hellish life until you die.

460
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:07,310
You'll lose everything and become lonely.

461
00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:09,020
Threats like that won't work.

462
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:11,840
You're just so pitiful.

463
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:15,630
You should take a look inside your own heart.

464
00:39:15,630 --> 00:39:19,620
Now, you don't even have a friend to drink with.

465
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:47,070
  Now, I cannot let anyone else die like my father did. 

466
00:39:47,910 --> 00:39:54,110
  For everyone's sake, I will kill the King with my own hands. 

467
00:39:56,750 --> 00:40:02,120
So I hope that you will help me, Royal Mother.

468
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:07,280
It's only human nature for a child to want to restore his birth mother's tombstone

469
00:40:07,280 --> 00:40:11,240
but you are also the son of the late King.

470
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:14,000
You must follow the late King's will.

471
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:16,190
My father's will?

472
00:40:16,190 --> 00:40:19,660
The late king banned the mention of your biological mother

473
00:40:19,660 --> 00:40:23,240
for the next 100 years after her death.

474
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:27,660
If you ignore that will, you'll be disposing of the power the royal command holds.

475
00:40:28,850 --> 00:40:30,530
The power...

476
00:40:30,530 --> 00:40:36,580
Keeping the late king's will is ultimately to establish your royal authority.

477
00:40:36,580 --> 00:40:42,890
The reason my royal authority is not stable is not because I'm not following my father's will,

478
00:40:42,890 --> 00:40:47,650
it's because my birth mother is the deposed queen.

479
00:40:47,650 --> 00:40:55,210
Therefore, even the faceless and nameless hooligans from the marketplace call themselves "Snail Brides"

480
00:40:55,210 --> 00:41:00,270
and dig around and find a problem with my legitimacy to the throne.

481
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:06,150
So as the solution, you're capturing them all to execute them.

482
00:41:06,150 --> 00:41:08,640
That's only a temporary solution.

483
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:13,690
Most importantly, my legitimacy must become stable

484
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:20,930
so I must restore my birth mother's tombstone.

485
00:41:31,470 --> 00:41:36,300
Your Majesty, we have captured the Leader of the Snail Brides.

486
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,740
What did you just say?!

487
00:41:39,740 --> 00:41:43,300
Turned himself in? Who turned himself in?

488
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:48,970
There's no way Orabeoni would have turned himself in. He left!

489
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:52,300
He should be far away from the capital so the chances of him even hearing this news is slim!

490
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:56,620
Even if he had heard the news, all of the gates leading into the capital have been shut down.

491
00:41:56,620 --> 00:41:58,270
He won't be able to come.

492
00:41:58,270 --> 00:42:04,710
Then, who? If it wasn't Orabeoni, who would have turned themselves in as the Leader of the Snail Brides?

493
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,830
  I would have been able to die as the Leader of the Snail Brides. 

494
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,420
Drag him out!

495
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:34,020
He had such a strong will that we broke him a bit.

496
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,690
Get him up.

497
00:42:43,100 --> 00:42:44,630
Get up!

498
00:42:49,670 --> 00:42:53,180
His Majesty was looking forward to this so eagerly.

499
00:42:53,180 --> 00:42:55,950
He'll be disappointed.

500
00:43:07,220 --> 00:43:08,860
Get up!

501
00:43:11,360 --> 00:43:14,230
He doesn't even have the strength to sit properly.

502
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:16,180
Just leave him.

503
00:43:20,310 --> 00:43:23,530
That's not the face I wanted to see.

504
00:43:23,530 --> 00:43:28,270
He used to be Grand Prince Jin Seong's right hand.

505
00:43:28,270 --> 00:43:30,050
If we torture him enough,

506
00:43:30,050 --> 00:43:34,980
he will say Grand Prince Jin Seong's name.

507
00:43:35,490 --> 00:43:37,580
It won't work.

508
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:42,110
I am the leader of the Snail Brides.

509
00:43:49,450 --> 00:43:51,860
Just kill me,

510
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:55,350
just like you killed my father.

511
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:56,560
Your father?

512
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:03,300
Yes, he is the son of the scribe who knew about the secret order.

513
00:44:05,530 --> 00:44:11,160
I promised your father that I would not harm you.

514
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:16,320
Why are you so stubborn? For Yeok who left so he could survive by himself,

515
00:44:16,320 --> 00:44:20,950
why do you and the Snail Brides have to endure torture?

516
00:44:26,090 --> 00:44:28,700
You just have to say one thing.

517
00:44:28,700 --> 00:44:32,840
"Grand Prince Jin Seong ordered this."

518
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:38,430
"Snail Brides is an organization Grand Prince Jin Seong created to aid in his treason."

519
00:44:38,430 --> 00:44:43,880
If you just say that one thing, both you and the Snail Brides can be free.

520
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:46,620
If that's the case,

521
00:44:49,560 --> 00:44:51,700
then the Snail Brides...

522
00:45:07,320 --> 00:45:09,420
Your Majesty!

523
00:45:21,980 --> 00:45:24,560
What a pity.

524
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:30,510
Now that I look at you, you put up an act to kill me.

525
00:45:30,510 --> 00:45:34,600
No, no, were you acting from the minute you turned yourself in?

526
00:45:34,600 --> 00:45:39,410
How regretful! If I had just killed you, all of Joseon would have been saved!

527
00:45:39,410 --> 00:45:42,580
No more innocent people would have died!

528
00:45:42,580 --> 00:45:45,610
Since you care so much about my Joseon and my people,

529
00:45:45,610 --> 00:45:48,500
I thank you.

530
00:45:49,120 --> 00:45:51,300
Publicly execute him.

531
00:45:51,300 --> 00:45:55,210
Cut off his limbs and hang them on the four grand gates, the four minor gates,

532
00:45:55,210 --> 00:45:59,330
and other places within the capital where it's easily visible.

533
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:01,450
So that Yeok can see,

534
00:46:01,450 --> 00:46:06,070
so that Yeok can hear.

535
00:46:06,070 --> 00:46:08,600
Yes, Your Majesty.

536
00:46:15,810 --> 00:46:18,380
Can you not sleep?

537
00:46:19,620 --> 00:46:21,730
What about you?

538
00:46:21,730 --> 00:46:26,220
You can't fall asleep so how can I sleep?

539
00:46:29,070 --> 00:46:30,910
I'm right here

540
00:46:30,910 --> 00:46:33,960
so relax and go to sleep.

541
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,530
I guess it's because this isn't our home.

542
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:40,270
You slept so well at the Pawn Shop.

543
00:46:40,270 --> 00:46:43,220
I always had nightmares

544
00:46:43,220 --> 00:46:48,350
but when I sleep next to you,

545
00:46:48,350 --> 00:46:51,460
I'm fine. It's fascinating.

546
00:46:51,460 --> 00:46:54,350
That's what "home" means.

547
00:46:54,350 --> 00:46:59,460
Now, I am your home.

548
00:47:00,310 --> 00:47:04,580
Yes, you are my home.

549
00:47:04,580 --> 00:47:07,890
Wherever and whenever I am,

550
00:47:07,890 --> 00:47:10,720
you are my home I must return to.

551
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:14,510
So now, we must stay together.

552
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:16,490
Alright?

553
00:47:17,710 --> 00:47:22,830
So that I won't lose my way back home.

554
00:47:25,010 --> 00:47:28,410
Just don't go too far away from home.

555
00:47:28,410 --> 00:47:33,110
Then, you won't lose your way either.

556
00:47:35,330 --> 00:47:39,630
Yes, your words are right.

557
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:05,590
I just can't fall asleep so I will just finish this.

558
00:48:05,590 --> 00:48:09,070
You'll probably be able to wear this tomorrow.

559
00:48:15,250 --> 00:48:17,030
Are you okay?

560
00:48:22,550 --> 00:48:24,540
Although I'm quite talented at cooking,

561
00:48:24,540 --> 00:48:27,690
I lack the skills for needlework.

562
00:48:31,220 --> 00:48:33,160
Are you worried?

563
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,550
Of course I'm worried!

564
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:37,620
Not me.

565
00:48:39,610 --> 00:48:42,340
Young Master Baek, Young Master Jo,

566
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:46,550
and Seo No, your friends.

567
00:48:52,750 --> 00:48:57,240
You can't go to them because of me, right?

568
00:48:57,240 --> 00:49:02,090
It's not that I can't go, I won't go.

569
00:49:02,090 --> 00:49:04,830
Weren't we on our way to Geochang?

570
00:49:04,830 --> 00:49:07,630
I even received Brother's permission to leave the capital.

571
00:49:08,410 --> 00:49:10,850
You know that 
 ♫   You approached silently   ♫

572
00:49:10,850 --> 00:49:14,780
yet inside your heart, you're already racing towards the capital.

573
00:49:14,780 --> 00:49:19,040
I'm anxious, scared, and afraid to death right now! 
 ♫   You smiled at me while offering your hand   ♫

574
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,130
Even if I remain awake to guard you like this all night,

575
00:49:23,870 --> 00:49:26,430
you're going to leave in the end, aren't you? 
 ♫   The time we spent together   ♫

576
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:32,380
Why can't you lie?! 
 ♫   is going far away   ♫

577
00:49:32,380 --> 00:49:35,190
You tell me lies all the time, 
 ♫  like a dream  ♫

578
00:49:35,190 --> 00:49:38,350
so why can't you make an excuse for yourself this time?! 
 ♫   I can't stand   ♫

579
00:49:38,350 --> 00:49:44,330
Didn't I promise not to lie to you anymore? 
 ♫   the longing now which is growing so   ♫

580
00:49:44,330 --> 00:49:46,120
Chae Gyeong. 
 ♫   Why didn't I know   ♫

581
00:49:46,120 --> 00:49:51,290
Leave. But this time, I'm coming with you. 
 ♫   that loving would be like this?   ♫

582
00:49:51,290 --> 00:49:55,390
- Chae Gyeong. 
 - Regardless of what you say, I'm going with you.

583
00:49:55,390 --> 00:49:58,580
♫   but leave even if I don't want to go   ♫

584
00:49:58,580 --> 00:50:02,830
♫   I now know that   ♫

585
00:50:02,830 --> 00:50:07,320
Alright, t-then...
 ♫   I can't live without you   ♫

586
00:50:07,320 --> 00:50:13,130
let's just see what's going on and depart immediately. 
 ♫   Don't go far away so I can see you again   ♫

587
00:50:13,130 --> 00:50:15,720
♫   I love you once again   ♫

588
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:18,650
We have to go down to Geochang.

589
00:50:18,650 --> 00:50:20,330
Alright.

590
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,550
Seo No.

591
00:50:54,810 --> 00:50:56,600
Seo No.

592
00:51:08,110 --> 00:51:10,620
Just to die like this,

593
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:13,430
did you act invincible all that time?

594
00:51:13,430 --> 00:51:16,510
Innocent citizens

595
00:51:16,510 --> 00:51:20,160
are dying by the minute. How can I remain still?

596
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:22,810
What do those people have to do with us?

597
00:51:22,810 --> 00:51:25,510
We don't know those people.

598
00:51:25,510 --> 00:51:27,730
Not me.

599
00:51:28,700 --> 00:51:34,360
Whoever that person may be, they look like me.

600
00:51:36,220 --> 00:51:38,740
Even the 3 year-old child,

601
00:51:39,520 --> 00:51:42,140
even the 80 year-old grandfather,

602
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:45,020
even the Auntie next door...

603
00:51:46,690 --> 00:51:52,390
Anyone who is persecuted because they are weak and poor looks like me.

604
00:51:52,390 --> 00:51:56,210
Seo No here, Seo No there, because there are Seo Nos everywhere,

605
00:51:59,770 --> 00:52:02,200
every time those people die,

606
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,390
I feel as if my father and I are dying.

607
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:09,300
It would have been better if we had succeeded.

608
00:52:09,300 --> 00:52:13,480
If we had succeeded, then I would have been able to lighten some of your burden

609
00:52:13,480 --> 00:52:16,330
before I left.

610
00:52:16,330 --> 00:52:18,450
You were foolish

611
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:21,150
and reckless.

612
00:52:24,270 --> 00:52:28,820
Yes, that's me.

613
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:31,670
Who will I drink with now?

614
00:52:33,100 --> 00:52:36,640
If you leave like this, when will I be able to smile?

615
00:52:42,190 --> 00:52:45,020
Just once,

616
00:52:45,020 --> 00:52:47,500
can't you smile right now?

617
00:52:50,700 --> 00:52:53,910
I hope that the last image I remember

618
00:52:55,290 --> 00:52:58,720
is your smile.

619
00:53:34,070 --> 00:53:35,930
- Husband! Husband!
 - Father! Father!

620
00:53:35,930 --> 00:53:42,430
These people have no connection to the Snail Brides.

621
00:53:42,430 --> 00:53:43,420
What should I do now? Goodness, what should I do?

622
00:53:43,420 --> 00:53:45,500
Release them.

623
00:53:51,240 --> 00:53:54,010
Please spare them!

624
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:57,520
Release them!

625
00:54:01,220 --> 00:54:03,580
Release them, now!

626
00:54:03,580 --> 00:54:05,700
Husband, please! Please, please!

627
00:54:05,700 --> 00:54:07,770
Release them.

628
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:15,150
Didn't he just testify? He said that these people have no connection to the Snail Brides.

629
00:54:18,110 --> 00:54:19,230
Now!

630
00:54:19,230 --> 00:54:21,050
Yes, sir!

631
00:54:25,380 --> 00:54:26,610
He's released!

632
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:28,490
- Thank you! Thank you! 
 - Thank you! Thank you!

633
00:54:28,490 --> 00:54:32,050
- Thank you! Thank you! 
 - Thank you!

634
00:54:32,050 --> 00:54:33,940
- Thank goodness! Thank the Heavens! 
 - Thank you! Thank you!

635
00:54:35,340 --> 00:54:39,340
 Your Highness the Grand Prince, thank you! Young Lady, thank you! 

636
00:54:39,340 --> 00:54:45,420
  Your Highness the Grand Prince, since I have nothing to give you, I will give you my life! I will die for you! 

637
00:54:45,420 --> 00:54:47,060
  You'll probably call me foolish. 

638
00:54:47,060 --> 00:54:48,370
Drag him up.

639
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:54,010
  You'll probably resent me for leaving like this. 

640
00:55:03,110 --> 00:55:05,980
  Young Lady Chae Gyeong's foolishness 

641
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,700
  and Your Highness's recklessness, 

642
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:13,460
  your methods to protect each other were good. 

643
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:31,360
Did you truly do this alone?

644
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:39,230
Yes, I did this alone.

645
00:55:39,230 --> 00:55:41,610
This is the last time I will ask you.

646
00:55:41,610 --> 00:55:46,680
If you had any other accomplices, report them now.

647
00:55:49,670 --> 00:55:54,180
There are none. I did this alone.

648
00:56:01,910 --> 00:56:03,760
Seo No...

649
00:56:10,780 --> 00:56:17,140
  I once thought that it would 

650
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:19,340
  have been nice to die when I become someone that resembled you two. 

651
00:56:22,400 --> 00:56:23,860
Leader of the Snail Brides,

652
00:56:23,860 --> 00:56:29,320
Seo No, plotted treason, created secrets with lies,

653
00:56:29,320 --> 00:56:33,760
and deceived and ridiculed the people.

654
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:38,280
Also he gathered rebellious people to disparage the king

655
00:56:38,280 --> 00:56:42,060
  I hope that the last image I remember 

656
00:56:42,060 --> 00:56:45,580
  is of you smiling. 

657
00:57:01,020 --> 00:57:09,350
The crime is grave and vicious. In accordance with the law, punish him with execution.

658
00:57:09,350 --> 00:57:11,700
Proceed with the execution!

659
00:57:23,260 --> 00:57:29,690
  Your Highness the Grand Prince and Young Lady Chae Gyeong, please protect each other. 

660
00:57:29,690 --> 00:57:37,910
  Because I have nothing left to protect in this world, I am leaving after finishing my duties. 

661
00:57:46,420 --> 00:57:48,260
Move aside!

662
00:57:59,860 --> 00:58:01,740
Continue.

663
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:28,300
Did Grand Prince Jin Seong not appear?

664
00:59:28,300 --> 00:59:30,190
Yes, Your Majesty. He still has not—

665
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:32,020
Let go of me!

666
00:59:34,360 --> 00:59:36,190
Your Majesty!

667
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,920
You're here. I was waiting for you.

668
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,230
Stop.

669
01:00:21,540 --> 01:00:23,650
What do you want?

670
01:00:23,650 --> 01:00:25,530
If I tell you, will you give it to me?

671
01:00:25,530 --> 01:00:31,140
Without doubt, you will say something I cannot give you.

672
01:00:31,140 --> 01:00:36,130
Without a doubt, you will request something you should not have.

673
01:00:36,130 --> 01:00:40,390
Therefore, I cannot give it to you.

674
01:00:40,390 --> 01:00:44,820
Then, what if I give it to you?

675
01:00:44,820 --> 01:00:49,170
If I give it to you, will you accept it?

676
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:53,100
What will you give me?

677
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:55,040
The throne.

678
01:00:56,600 --> 01:00:59,120
Take the throne.

679
01:01:01,220 --> 01:01:04,200
You can't just leave like that.

680
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:09,580
Then everything I've done until now will have been for nothing.

681
01:01:09,580 --> 01:01:10,590
Your Majesty.

682
01:01:10,590 --> 01:01:14,550
Until the end, you must consume yourself with thoughts of revenge against me

683
01:01:14,550 --> 01:01:17,250
and scheme to take my throne.

684
01:01:17,250 --> 01:01:22,870
That's how I can resent and bother you.

685
01:01:22,870 --> 01:01:26,110
See? Look at how nice this is.

686
01:01:26,110 --> 01:01:31,490
Since you're in front of me wielding a sword, my blood is boiling.

687
01:01:31,490 --> 01:01:37,010
With such delightful entertainment here, where are you leaving to?

688
01:01:41,510 --> 01:01:42,220
Hyungnim!

689
01:01:42,220 --> 01:01:45,210
 Your Majesty! Your Majesty! 

690
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:49,820
It's treason! Grand Prince Jin Seong is trying to kill His Majesty!

691
01:01:49,820 --> 01:01:51,770
Capture him!

692
01:01:57,000 --> 01:01:59,280
Goodbye,

693
01:02:01,090 --> 01:02:02,890
younger brother.

694
01:02:06,050 --> 01:02:08,020
Your Majesty!

695
01:02:24,660 --> 01:02:31,730
