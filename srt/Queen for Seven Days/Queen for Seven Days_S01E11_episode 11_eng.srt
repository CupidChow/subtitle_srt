00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:43,990
 Episode 11 

2
00:00:43,990 --> 00:00:48,940
I must have gone insane. I can't believe I tried to send you to another man.

3
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:54,420
I am the King. This nation's rule is that

4
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,650
there must be nothing that the King cannot have! Isn't that right?

5
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,430
Therefore, I must have you too.

6
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:21,270


7
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,110
Become a spy.

8
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:41,450
Report Yeok's every single move.

9
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:45,320
The moment Yeok forms any intent, that's having a traitorous mind.

10
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:51,080
Every move Yeok makes is equivalent to plotting treason.

11
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,660
What do you mean by a traitorous mind, Your Majesty?

12
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:58,520
This is the reason why I am making you marry Yeok.

13
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:04,030
Be my eyes from the place closest to Yeok

14
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:06,480
and monitor him from there.

15
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,090
So, there might be a moment that you will have to kill Yeok with this dagger.

16
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:20,280
Will you still do it?

17
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:38,490
Yes. I will.

18
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:47,750
However, I won't accept this dagger.

19
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,800
There won't be a need for it.

20
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,180
The reason I will go ahead with this marriage is

21
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:06,490
to quell the suspicions between Your Majesty and the Grand Prince and to prove his loyalty to you.

22
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:18,670
Royal Mother.

23
00:03:21,690 --> 00:03:23,140
You're coming back now.

24
00:03:23,140 --> 00:03:26,820
Yes, I am a bit late.

25
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,640
Let's go.

26
00:03:31,580 --> 00:03:37,950
You trust Yeok that much? To the extent that you dare to act this arrogant in front of me?

27
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,830
To the extent that you are not afraid of death?

28
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:45,910
What will you do if your trust in him is wrong?

29
00:03:45,910 --> 00:03:51,180
Then, I will accept this dagger.

30
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:57,930
With this dagger, I will pay the price for my  misplaced trust.

31
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:10,970
The pawn shop has been found out?

32
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:16,720
Yes. Thus, I think we need to hasten the rebellion.

33
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,620
What has gotten into you?

34
00:04:18,620 --> 00:04:21,730
Even if it takes time, you said you will only sit on the throne

35
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:26,640
after winning the people's heart, heaven's will, and the trust of the court and royal family.

36
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:30,530
It was my greed.

37
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:32,850
Greed?

38
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:40,530
While I am trying to win those hearts, those who toil for me will be put in greater danger,

39
00:04:40,530 --> 00:04:46,390
and those who trust me will be put through a greater test.

40
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:49,280
I have overlooked that.

41
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:54,570
As soon as the wedding ceremony is over, I will meet the officials of the Court that we need.

42
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:56,440
Royal Mother...

43
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:59,480
I will look for the secret order.

44
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:04,250
The secret order is the quickest way to convince them.

45
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:20,740
  Do you trust Yeok that much?  

46
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:23,710
 To the extent that you dare to act this arrogant in front of me? 

47
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:25,950
 What will you do if your trust is wrong? 

48
00:05:25,950 --> 00:05:30,240
  I will pay the price for my  misplaced trust.  

49
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,680
I will wait for that day with anticipation.

50
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:37,330
It won't take long.

51
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:55,200
  From now on, I will deceive you even more thoroughly  

52
00:05:56,100 --> 00:06:01,520
  since you'll suffer if you find out the truth. 

53
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:05,000
  You'll be in danger. 

54
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:17,520
  The reason I will go ahead with this marriage is  

55
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:23,820
  to quell the suspicions between Your Majesty and the Grand Prince and to prove his loyalty to you. 

56
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:30,120
  From now on, I will protect the Grand Prince using whatever means necessary.  

57
00:06:36,530 --> 00:06:41,780
All the items stolen from you were returned?

58
00:06:41,780 --> 00:06:47,420
Yes, when I got up this morning, I found them on the porch of the men's quarters.

59
00:06:47,420 --> 00:06:51,640
I also found them in the servants' quarters.

60
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:55,490
My items were returned too, Your Majesty.

61
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:00,300
We haven't even caught the thief yet the items were returned?

62
00:07:01,980 --> 00:07:08,210
By chance, maybe the thief voluntarily returned the items to you?

63
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:12,110
Thieves would not do such a dangerous and useless thing.

64
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:16,530
Maybe it's the Snail Brides.

65
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,870
Snail Brides?

66
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,520
Snail Brides?

67
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,060
Come to think of it, snail shells were left by the door.

68
00:07:26,790 --> 00:07:30,460
Snail Brides? Who are they?

69
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:32,710
Since a year or two ago, when there is a drought or famine,

70
00:07:32,710 --> 00:07:36,520
there was someone who would leave rice to those in need.

71
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,920
I only know that at one point some people started calling this person the Snail Bride.

72
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:44,930
I have also heard about the news of the Snail Bride.

73
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:48,390
Some say it's one person, others say it's a group.

74
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:52,950
Nothing has been clearly revealed yet.

75
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:59,840
Those Snail Brides even recovered items stolen from the Court officials this time?

76
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,580
They can't be a simple relief organization.

77
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:06,350
We need to investigate this matter.

78
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:19,830
Snail Brides?

79
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:26,760
Isn't Yeok's naming ability so adorable?

80
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:31,590
However, his deeds are not adorable in the least.

81
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:37,660
He was able to win the people's hearts, and he's even starting to gain the court officials.

82
00:08:37,660 --> 00:08:44,520
Grand Prince Jin Seong is making definite movements to seize the throne.

83
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,420
Who said I will give it to him?

84
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:55,410
Since he initiated the fight, I must respond.

85
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,030
So, where is their hideout?

86
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:17,600
If we relocate our base immediately, it will only raise more suspicions.

87
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:22,520
First, seal the door to the pawn shop.

88
00:09:22,520 --> 00:09:26,370
How about making a door over there?

89
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:37,780
Why aren't they saying anything when there is a customer?

90
00:09:53,290 --> 00:09:56,720
How many years have you been in business?

91
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,830
- 1 year. 
 - 3 years.

92
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:08,010
Yes, we opened a small linen shop 3 years ago but it went under,

93
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,190
so it's been a year since we changed the line of business to a pawn shop.

94
00:10:12,190 --> 00:10:15,290
Yes. That is so.

95
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,070
Where is His Highness the Grand Prince?

96
00:10:52,070 --> 00:10:54,660
I heard the Chief Royal Secretary came by earlier...

97
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:58,880
The King.

98
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:06,600
Your Majesty.

99
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:09,470
I give my greetings, Your Majesty.

100
00:11:10,810 --> 00:11:14,330
It must be the King. He just met Myeong Hye and the Deputy Commander.

101
00:11:29,130 --> 00:11:34,600
I already guessed long ago that you'd be backing Yeok, Deputy Commander.

102
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:37,240
There is no need to be nervous.

103
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:43,300
But, it's interesting to see a new face.

104
00:11:44,570 --> 00:11:47,670
You're the maternal niece of the Deputy Commander,

105
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:51,950
and the daughter of criminal Yoon Yeo Pil.

106
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:57,310
Yes, Your Majesty. I met you before at the Queen Dowager's quarters.

107
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:00,560
Is that so? At the Queen Dowager's quarters?

108
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:08,850
I heard you were born while your father was in exile for a long time.

109
00:12:08,850 --> 00:12:13,160
So I heard you had to go through a lot even as a child.

110
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:16,470
Are you helping Yeok

111
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:19,170
to bring your family to glory again?

112
00:12:23,030 --> 00:12:28,260
If Yeok gains more power, do you think you and your family

113
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:31,250
will be able to regain the glory of the old days?

114
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:37,790
No, Your Majesty. I became the Grand Prince's friend after saving his life by chance.

115
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:40,550
I have no other intention.

116
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:44,980
You saved Yeok's life?

117
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:56,090
Then, it must be you who sent a corpse that resembled Yeok

118
00:12:56,090 --> 00:13:01,600
and made Yeok a dead person to the world.

119
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:05,000
- Your Majesty. 
 - Please spare me!

120
00:13:12,290 --> 00:13:18,070
It must be you that secretly sent that news to the Queen Dowager.

121
00:13:18,070 --> 00:13:21,330
It hasn't been long since the Queen Dowager became aware of it.

122
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:23,770
I only sent the news after the Grand Prince was fully healed.

123
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:26,000
Anyhow,

124
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:33,500
the Queen Dowager must really cherish you.

125
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:39,180
You're her precious son's savior.

126
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:51,700
Things are becoming more interesting.

127
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:55,240
Yeok had a girl.

128
00:13:55,940 --> 00:13:59,990
He acted as if he only had eyes for Chae Gyeong.

129
00:14:02,130 --> 00:14:05,060
You must be upset.

130
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:10,680
Since Yeok is marrying another girl.

131
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:14,000
No.

132
00:14:46,210 --> 00:14:51,910
A girl who stayed by Yeok's side for the past five years.

133
00:15:02,030 --> 00:15:08,890
There were a total of four people inside. Deputy Commander, a girl, two men. Grand Prince Jin Seong wasn't there.

134
00:15:08,890 --> 00:15:13,560
From now on, report if Grand Prince Jin Seong... Or rather,

135
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,830
report every single person entering or exiting this pawn shop.

136
00:15:18,830 --> 00:15:20,670
Yes.

137
00:15:26,370 --> 00:15:28,740
Grand Prince.

138
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:31,380
What will you do now?

139
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:37,050
Thanks to your arrogance and dogmatism in an attempt to tame me,

140
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,760
the enemy has found out about the pawn shop.

141
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:43,630
The Chief Royal Secretary and even the King

142
00:15:43,630 --> 00:15:47,770
will  now come and go as they please and monitor us.

143
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:50,800
They will plant people everywhere to watch us.

144
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,160
I am sorry.

145
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:57,170
Don't go beyond your power in the future. Whatever the matter.

146
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:01,910
Everything regarding the Snail Brides, report it to me first and then proceed.

147
00:16:01,910 --> 00:16:05,680
What should we do about the pawn shop? Don't we have to change our hideout?

148
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,160
No, if we rashly move or act in any unusual way, it will only raise more suspicions.

149
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,400
They will think we are running or hiding because we have a guilty conscience.

150
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,990
Yes. That's why Hyungnim Nak Cheon and I were trying to come up with a solution.

151
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:19,120
We should hold off meeting in the secret room for now,

152
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:23,500
and meetings of the Snail Brides will be held in the bamboo forest cabin. It will be safer that way.

153
00:16:23,500 --> 00:16:27,970
During that time, we will make a new door there.

154
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,560
Buy the straw cottage next to the secret room

155
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,350
and try to come up with a way to make an underground passage.

156
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:36,390
Look here.

157
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:41,500
This is the entrance to the pawn shop, there is the straw cottage behind the rear wall.

158
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:45,830
However, the road to this major street is in the opposite direction.

159
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:50,540
No one will suspect these two buildings are somehow connected.

160
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:55,530
They say it's the darkest right under the lamp  (right under your nose) . It's the safest here as long as the secret room is not discovered.

161
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:59,270
If we do business as usual and the Snail Brides are active too,

162
00:16:59,270 --> 00:17:01,300
they won't be able to frame us.

163
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:05,430
Yes. That seems like the best solution for now.

164
00:17:05,430 --> 00:17:09,940
Then, I will purchase this straw cottage under someone else's name.

165
00:17:16,910 --> 00:17:22,370
♫   Leave comfortably.  ♫

166
00:17:22,370 --> 00:17:25,960
♫  You are waking up from a harsh dream  ♫

167
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:29,590
Do you have tableware? I would like to see Bangjja Yugi  (dishes made with copper and tin)  if possible.

168
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:32,900
These are all Bangjja Yugi from Anseong.

169
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:37,870
It keeps the food warm and its detoxifying abilities are the best.

170
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:39,770
It's worth the price.

171
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,820
It's too heavy and I don't like it, Mother.

172
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:47,060
I like those over there. They're pretty and simple.

173
00:17:47,060 --> 00:17:49,960
Please give me these. It's part of a dowry, so assort them accordingly.

174
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:50,870
Yes, ma'am.

175
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:56,230
♫  Just know that you're drenched with the sunset   ♫

176
00:17:56,230 --> 00:18:00,300
- Good luck with sales. 
 - Thank you.

177
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,870
♫  Don't look back and don't worry   ♫

178
00:18:02,870 --> 00:18:07,200
Why does she buy so much? Only expensive things at that. Try to stop her.

179
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:09,900
Do you think Madam is doing that out of joy?

180
00:18:09,900 --> 00:18:13,340
Since the Queen Dowager is picky, she has to match her standards.

181
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:16,460
Enough with the talking and follow me.

182
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,580
This.

183
00:18:17,580 --> 00:18:20,330
No, this is not it. Give me something else.

184
00:18:20,330 --> 00:18:23,930
- Here 
 - This is so pretty. Try to smile.

185
00:18:23,930 --> 00:18:26,540
It's so pretty.

186
00:18:26,540 --> 00:18:30,660
♫  light up my love in the night sky every day.  ♫

187
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,410
I never taught her how to sew.

188
00:18:33,410 --> 00:18:36,260
What if the Queen Dowager picks on that?

189
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:43,060
Why? No matter how much I teach, she never improves.

190
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,300
It's not your fault, ma'am.

191
00:18:47,810 --> 00:18:50,590
 Saju -- Four Pillars: year, month, day and hour of birth which are believed to influence your destiny 

192
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:55,970
Queen Dowager graciously gave me the task of delivering the letter to the fiancée's house  (in which the Four Pillars of the bridegroom-to-be are written) 

193
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,240
 Geun Bong: Sincerely yours 

194
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:03,670
I was always curious. You used to be closer to the King before.

195
00:19:03,670 --> 00:19:07,600
What made you become so close to the Queen Dowager?

196
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:09,840
When the late king passed away,

197
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:15,760
he left a will asking me to take good care of the Queen Dowager and Grand Prince Jin Seong.

198
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:22,110
Can I trust that your loyalty to the late king will continue with the current king as well?

199
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:28,860
Are you by chance doubting my loyalty to the king?

200
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:36,410
I am perhaps overly sensitive in asking if you have any other intentions in assisting Grand Prince Jin Seong.

201
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:42,040
Do you not have other intentions, First Vice Premier?

202
00:19:42,040 --> 00:19:43,740
What do you mean?

203
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,390
You also found out relatively early that

204
00:19:46,390 --> 00:19:49,780
Grand Prince Jin Seong was alive.

205
00:19:49,780 --> 00:19:53,010
However, you didn't tell this to the King and remained silent on this matter.

206
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:57,850
If the King finds out about this, he will be quite disappointed.

207
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:01,560
Wouldn't he feel betrayed?

208
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:08,940
I just took a step back since my daughter was involved. There was no other intention.

209
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:14,640
However, thanks to that, these two are even getting married.

210
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:19,780
Like the Queen Dowager said, the two really are destined to be.

211
00:20:19,780 --> 00:20:22,220
You're absolutely right.

212
00:20:22,220 --> 00:20:26,840
Anyway, please take good care of my daughter.

213
00:20:26,840 --> 00:20:32,250
No need. I ask for your care.

214
00:20:38,630 --> 00:20:42,410
I don't like Yugi ware  (made of tin and copper)  and it is so heavy. What's the need for this useless suffering?

215
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:47,010
Why are you saying those things to me? I am not the one who chose and paid for it.

216
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:50,010
If you have such poor taste in picking out household items,

217
00:20:50,010 --> 00:20:51,930
I wouldn't be able to marry you off twice.

218
00:20:51,930 --> 00:20:55,320
How can I marry twice?

219
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:01,510
His Majesty sent me here.

220
00:21:13,410 --> 00:21:15,270
Yeok.

221
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:19,910
I couldn't tell you earlier.

222
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,170
The King asked me to give you this.

223
00:21:23,170 --> 00:21:25,940
He asked you to come to this place as soon as you read this.

224
00:21:51,090 --> 00:21:54,090
- Your Highness the Grand Prince.
- Chae Gyeong.

225
00:21:55,290 --> 00:21:58,410
It seems my brother has called the both of us.

226
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:01,120
Do you know what this is about?

227
00:22:06,230 --> 00:22:08,510
We'll find out once we enter.

228
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,690
Your Majesty.

229
00:22:27,170 --> 00:22:28,370
You're here.

230
00:22:28,370 --> 00:22:32,110
We greet Your Highness the Grand Prince and the Lady.

231
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:37,730
Is this house to your liking?

232
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:42,550
This is my wedding gift to you.

233
00:22:42,550 --> 00:22:47,920
Just know that these people here will help you two around the house.

234
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:51,570
Don't worry about anything else and just concentrate on preparations for the marriage.

235
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:55,980
Your Majesty, this present is too excessive for us. Please withdraw it.

236
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,440
Excessive?

237
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:02,240
This house will be occupied by this nation's Grand Prince and the First Vice Premier's daughter.

238
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:04,320
It should at least be this much.

239
00:23:06,210 --> 00:23:11,440
Are you planning to reject the gift I painstakingly worked to prepare?

240
00:23:56,620 --> 00:23:59,330
Shouldn't you introduce yourself at this point?

241
00:23:59,330 --> 00:24:03,210
My greetings are late. I'm Eunuch Song.

242
00:24:03,210 --> 00:24:06,240
Eunuch Song, what is your assigned duty?

243
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,010
My duty is to assist you, Your Highness the Grand Prince, and your wife, the Lady.

244
00:24:14,950 --> 00:24:16,950
  It wasn't enough that you barged into the pawn shop 

245
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:19,860
  and took Chae Gyeong as your spy. 

246
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,580
 Now, you're going to monitor me like this? 

247
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:24,900
  This is a gift? 

248
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:30,690
I will receive a daily report of your and the Grand Prince's activities from Eunuch Song.

249
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:36,100
I will confirm if there is the slightest difference in what you are reporting to me.

250
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:40,310
You want me to report to you daily?

251
00:24:40,310 --> 00:24:42,180
Yes.

252
00:24:42,180 --> 00:24:48,050
I will also reserve a place for you to stay in the palace.

253
00:24:48,050 --> 00:24:52,330
How long must I do this for you to believe His Highness the Grand Prince?

254
00:24:53,750 --> 00:24:55,950
Until death.

255
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:02,410
By any chance, is there something else I am not aware of?

256
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:05,400
Your Majesty, you're not the type of person to act this cruel

257
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:08,180
towards His Highness the Grand Prince or me.

258
00:25:08,180 --> 00:25:13,610
Do not recklessly  pretend to know me.

259
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:18,800
You know absolutely nothing about me or about Yeok.

260
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:23,020
Tell me what I do not know.

261
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:27,450
Then, what do you know?

262
00:25:28,490 --> 00:25:31,050
How Yeok has lived until now,

263
00:25:31,050 --> 00:25:32,920
what kind of people he's with—

264
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:36,190
I know, I heard everything.

265
00:25:36,190 --> 00:25:44,700
Then, you must also know that the person who saved Yeok was a woman.

266
00:25:45,710 --> 00:25:47,760
A woman?

267
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,920
It seems you didn't know.

268
00:25:51,860 --> 00:25:56,450
Then and now, you're still the same. You're quite pitiful.

269
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,540
You're always being deceived by Yeok.

270
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:17,800
Grand Prince Jin Seong came out of the pawn shop?

271
00:26:17,800 --> 00:26:21,880
When I visited, Yeok was definitely not in there.

272
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:26,040
By any chance, isn't it possible you missed him entering?

273
00:26:26,040 --> 00:26:28,340
Aside from me, everyone that was monitoring

274
00:26:28,340 --> 00:26:30,030
did not see him enter

275
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:32,600
and only saw him leave.

276
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,260
Then, there must be another door leading to the pawn shop

277
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:43,200
or a secret hideout all of this time.

278
00:26:58,390 --> 00:27:01,950
What about quitting the pawn shop?

279
00:27:01,950 --> 00:27:04,820
It doesn't seem to make much profit

280
00:27:04,820 --> 00:27:07,780
and it doesn't look quite nice either.

281
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:13,310
Do you think I'm running the business because of money?

282
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:18,270
Then, is that place your playground?

283
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:25,000
While disguising it as a pawn shop on the outside, within somewhere deep inside,

284
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:32,000
are you holding gang meetings with those who accept you as their leader?

285
00:27:32,060 --> 00:27:37,910
Although I'm not sure what kind of things you've heard from the people around you, it is all a misunderstanding.

286
00:27:37,910 --> 00:27:39,180
A misunderstanding?

287
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:45,600
Of course, receiving those kinds of suspicion, scrutiny, and misunderstanding is my fate.

288
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:51,590
Just as suspicion,  scrutiny, and misunderstanding is the fate of the King.

289
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,500
I can't believe you regard my subordinate's scrutiny

290
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:59,600
of your suspicious behavior as your fate.

291
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:04,100
Yeok, you have become quite cowardly.

292
00:28:09,460 --> 00:28:11,440
Thank you for the compliment.

293
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,270
The more cowardly I become, the greater

294
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:18,290
the evidence becomes that I'm living well.

295
00:28:18,290 --> 00:28:22,750
I'm someone who cannot do anything,

296
00:28:22,750 --> 00:28:25,700
the Grand Prince of this nation of Joseon.

297
00:28:25,700 --> 00:28:32,200
Yes, because the more cowardly you become, the safer you and your people will become.

298
00:28:32,200 --> 00:28:37,040
For you, becoming cowardly is courage.

299
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:40,820
I'm honored that you understand.

300
00:28:55,490 --> 00:28:59,380
Your mask is becoming stronger by the minute.

301
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:01,530
That's not bad.

302
00:29:01,530 --> 00:29:04,560
This means that when Chae Gyeong takes off your mask,

303
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:09,100
the stronger your sense of betrayal will be.

304
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,630
Everyone in our new residence are Court Ladies.

305
00:29:30,630 --> 00:29:33,520
Since you won't be familiar with them,

306
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:37,050
make sure you bring a few people you can trust.

307
00:29:37,050 --> 00:29:38,480
Alright.

308
00:29:39,430 --> 00:29:42,840
Just yesterday night, everything seemed like a dream.

309
00:29:43,600 --> 00:29:46,050
Reality is starting to set in now.

310
00:29:46,050 --> 00:29:47,650
About what?

311
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:52,600
What do you think? Just this and that.

312
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,500
About marriage too...

313
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:59,060
That's why...

314
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:05,000
This is your last chance.

315
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:10,910
If by any chance you have something you hid from me or could not tell me before, please confess now.

316
00:30:10,910 --> 00:30:13,760
If you tell me everything now, I can forgive everything.

317
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,740
But once we get married, forget it.

318
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:24,250
The same goes for you, it's still not too late.

319
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:27,870
This is your last chance.

320
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:32,500
If you are afraid or regretful, you can stop here.

321
00:30:34,280 --> 00:30:36,300
Run away from me.

322
00:30:36,980 --> 00:30:39,100
How can you say such a thing?

323
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm saying this for your sake.

324
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:45,400
Once we get married, I'll be an outsider to my own family.

325
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,810
Your Highness the Grand Prince will become the only person I can trust.

326
00:30:47,810 --> 00:30:53,080
At a time like this, you should tell me, "I love you. I love you. Again, I love you."

327
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,480
You need to embrace me, hug me, and be warm and affectionate.

328
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:04,500
By any chance, do you not love me?

329
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:08,990
Are you really not going to answer?!

330
00:31:08,990 --> 00:31:12,650
If it was something I could express in words, I would! A hundred times, a thousand times, I would!

331
00:31:13,970 --> 00:31:16,560
But, what power do words have?

332
00:31:18,050 --> 00:31:20,910
Everything starts from a word.

333
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:26,800
First, you express with words and soon move to actions.

334
00:31:26,800 --> 00:31:32,160
Repetition of those steps soon become the life of a couple.

335
00:31:32,810 --> 00:31:35,400
Is there a big deal about a heart that loves?

336
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:39,450
You just have to follow the procedures. Isn't that true?

337
00:31:51,470 --> 00:31:54,320
I caught a disease again: the disease where I say things I don't even mean.

338
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:58,280
  Then and now, you're still the same. You're quite pitiful. 

339
00:31:58,280 --> 00:32:01,290
  You're always being deceived by Yeok. 

340
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:07,160
  Your Majesty.  It is not that  I am being deceived now by His Highness the Grand Prince,  

341
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:09,790
  but that I'm waiting for him. 

342
00:32:21,580 --> 00:32:23,760
I'll go easy on you, though.

343
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,270
What?

344
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:31,210
Because you're someone who says more with your eyes than you do with your mouth,

345
00:32:31,210 --> 00:32:36,700
I won't become upset just because you won't answer a question or you're being stingy with expressing your thoughts.

346
00:32:38,150 --> 00:32:43,840
After all, I can teach you step-by-step as we live together.

347
00:33:03,090 --> 00:33:05,780
  This is your last chance. 

348
00:33:05,780 --> 00:33:11,880
  If by any chance you have something you hid from me or could not tell me before, please confess now. 

349
00:33:12,800 --> 00:33:20,900
  I'm sorry that the sole weapons I have to protect you are lies. 

350
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,760
Move over there a bit!

351
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:39,720
Until when do we have to do this when we have our perfectly fine hidden room?

352
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:48,640
For a while, all of the Royal Family and the Royal Court will be preoccupied

353
00:33:48,640 --> 00:33:51,350
with Grand Prince Jin Seong and the First Vice Premier's daughter's wedding.

354
00:33:51,350 --> 00:33:55,900
You sound as if you're speaking about a stranger. Are you deliberately trying to hide how excited you are?

355
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,640
Didn't you hear what Maiden Myeong Hye said? This is work, work!

356
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:02,000
- Some very exciting work.
- Some very exciting work.

357
00:34:03,610 --> 00:34:07,040
Now, I want to start sorting the Court officials.

358
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,900
Among the officials loyal to the king, Deputy Minister of Defense Ryu Ja Gwang

359
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:12,450
is the second most corrupt official after Chief Royal Secretary Im.

360
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:14,380
- His crime is—
- Accepting bribes.

361
00:34:14,380 --> 00:34:19,320
We saw his storage recently; his hidden possessions amount to way more than the stipend he receives.

362
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:24,520
Fine, collect all the  information about Ryu Ja Gwang, including bribes.

363
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:27,080
Lord Yu in Myohyang-roo.

364
00:34:27,080 --> 00:34:31,570
Lord Yu in Myohyang-roo is in here as well. Wow, he must frequent the gisaeng house often.

365
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:35,680
Focus on raiding that place. I'm sure that there'll be something worth taking.

366
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,360
Where are you going?

367
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,920
You told me to go to the gisaeng house.

368
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:46,280
Don't worry about this place and just prepare for your wedding.

369
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:47,910
Let's go.

370
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,640
Do you want to go too?

371
00:34:53,640 --> 00:34:56,880
I have other plans.

372
00:35:12,930 --> 00:35:17,170
Are you the Chief who lived in Dongjeokjun Village a few years ago?

373
00:35:17,170 --> 00:35:21,100
Yes, but who are you?

374
00:35:21,100 --> 00:35:24,560
Five years ago, there was a house that was burnt to the ground.

375
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:27,220
Do you remember the family who lived in that house?

376
00:35:27,220 --> 00:35:32,010
F-five years? Of course I remember!

377
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:35,860
But, who are you people to search for Seo No's father?

378
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:38,970
If he is the son of the Royal Scribe,

379
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:44,250
then isn't it possible that Grand Prince Jin Seong already has the secret order?

380
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:50,800
No, they still don't have the secret order either.

381
00:35:50,850 --> 00:35:52,300
How do you know?

382
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:58,160
If they possessed the secret order, why would they create the pawn shop, collect information,

383
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:03,380
and fulfill the painstaking role of the righteous bandits?

384
00:36:03,380 --> 00:36:07,750
If he had the order, he wouldn't have remained hidden like a rat.

385
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:10,720
Do you have an assumption?

386
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:19,210
- Auntie, please give me some food!
- Thank you for the meal!

387
00:36:19,210 --> 00:36:23,680
Is it true that Grand Prince Jin Seong is marrying the First Vice Premier's daughter?

388
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:27,690
I heard that the two families planned the wedding since long ago.

389
00:36:27,690 --> 00:36:30,510
Well, since His Highness the Grand Prince returned alive ...

390
00:36:30,510 --> 00:36:34,120
By the way, the palace must have been chaotic

391
00:36:34,120 --> 00:36:37,220
since someone believed to be dead suddenly appeared!

392
00:36:37,220 --> 00:36:39,950
Indeed.

393
00:36:39,950 --> 00:36:42,320
Goodbye!

394
00:36:48,440 --> 00:36:52,340
  At times like this, you should tell me "I love you. I love you." 

395
00:36:52,340 --> 00:36:55,380
 You need to embrace me, hug me, and be warm and affectionate! 

396
00:36:55,380 --> 00:37:00,780
  Because at the very least, I want to say those words when we're both honest with each other. 

397
00:37:00,780 --> 00:37:05,050
  When there are no secrets left between us, then  

398
00:37:05,050 --> 00:37:08,950
  I will say those words a thousand times, ten thousand times. 

399
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:25,560
  The more cowardly you become, the safer you and your people will be. 

400
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,220
  For you, becoming cowardly is courage. 

401
00:38:00,690 --> 00:38:02,550
What is it?

402
00:38:14,910 --> 00:38:19,290
Your Highness the Grand Prince, do you remember me?

403
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:41,040
You... what do you believe in to act so arrogant?

404
00:38:41,040 --> 00:38:43,150
It's not about believing in anything.

405
00:38:43,150 --> 00:38:46,330
So you admit that you're arrogant.

406
00:38:46,330 --> 00:38:50,770
Even if I refute it, the answer is already set because

407
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,660
you're not someone who listens to others.

408
00:38:52,660 --> 00:38:56,030
If I were a person who doesn't listen to others, would I be here like this now?!

409
00:38:56,030 --> 00:38:59,060
I would have married Orabeoni a long time ago and ensured that

410
00:38:59,060 --> 00:39:01,400
that wench, Sin Chae Gyeong, wouldn't even have been able to come near him!

411
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:04,330
A wench? You should use prettier words.

412
00:39:04,330 --> 00:39:08,190
You were the one who told me to "respect Orabeoni's wishes" and whatnot.

413
00:39:08,190 --> 00:39:11,830
This all happened because of your nonsense!

414
00:39:11,830 --> 00:39:17,100
I thought following your advice would be cool, but you were wrong.

415
00:39:19,010 --> 00:39:21,820
Maiden Myeong Hye, you are cool.

416
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:24,080
That's why—

417
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:27,680
What?

418
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:29,920
You are cool.

419
00:39:31,550 --> 00:39:34,430
You have always been cool.

420
00:39:34,430 --> 00:39:38,820
What's with you? You're already drunk?

421
00:39:38,820 --> 00:39:45,690
Risking your entire life to live for someone else, that's something not everyone can do.

422
00:39:50,560 --> 00:39:52,610
You do it too.

423
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:59,690
I... am someone who has to repay my debt to the Grand Prince, even if it is through death.

424
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:16,290
There's a way for you to repay that debt all at once.

425
00:40:16,290 --> 00:40:21,090
Since the pawn shop has been discovered, we have to rush our rebellion.

426
00:40:24,750 --> 00:40:26,740
Tell me where

427
00:40:29,830 --> 00:40:32,050
your father is.

428
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:42,190
I don't know.

429
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:46,780
If you called me because of that, I will leave now.

430
00:40:49,270 --> 00:40:51,170
Don't leave.

431
00:40:53,640 --> 00:40:57,560
Tomorrow is Orabeoni's wedding.

432
00:40:58,390 --> 00:41:03,320
If you leave me alone, I don't know what I'll do.

433
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:51,880
  Seo No, it's your father. 

434
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:54,210
Seo No's father...

435
00:41:54,210 --> 00:42:00,420
  I have something to tell you regarding the secret order, so come to the rest station by the crossroad where the inn is located. 

436
00:42:29,330 --> 00:42:30,800
Who is it?

437
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:35,500
Chae Gyeong, it's me, Lee Yeok.

438
00:42:40,660 --> 00:42:44,490
Tomorrow is our wedding! What are you doing here so late at night?

439
00:42:44,490 --> 00:42:47,430
Tonight is the last time I'll be a bachelor.

440
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:50,750
Shouldn't I also give you something?

441
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:55,340
It seems as if I've only received but never given.

442
00:42:56,650 --> 00:42:58,450
A token?

443
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,940
Yes.

444
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:07,060
Then, give it to me quickly and leave. What if someone sees?

445
00:43:20,510 --> 00:43:24,990
Ah, I thought... I have a good memory so—
♫   Suddenly, the entire world   ♫

446
00:43:24,990 --> 00:43:27,200
♫   is filled by you  ♫

447
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:32,320
By any chance, did you just say you have a good memory? 
 ♫  Suddenly, you were   ♫

448
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:36,490
Also, this time I warned you. 
♫   there without a sound   ♫

449
00:43:36,490 --> 00:43:39,620
♫   The first moment I saw you,   ♫

450
00:43:39,620 --> 00:43:40,790
If you don't want it, 
 ♫   I was so nervous   ♫

451
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:43,200
♫   I couldn't bring myself to look at your eyes   ♫

452
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,190
you can reject it before I count to ten.

453
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:48,120
♫  What should I do now?  ♫

454
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:53,300
♫  I feel like my breathing is going to stop   ♫

455
00:43:53,300 --> 00:43:54,870
Ten.

456
00:43:55,950 --> 00:43:59,370
♫   I want to hold you,   ♫

457
00:43:59,370 --> 00:44:03,650
♫   the one whose brilliance chills my heart   ♫

458
00:44:03,650 --> 00:44:07,490
♫   I'm afraid you might fly away   ♫

459
00:44:07,490 --> 00:44:11,320
♫   when the wind blows   ♫

460
00:44:11,320 --> 00:44:15,480
♫  Because your smile and tears  ♫

461
00:44:15,480 --> 00:44:21,530
♫  fill my heart.  ♫

462
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:27,920
♫   I will always love only you  ♫

463
00:44:30,080 --> 00:44:32,750
♫    This feeling which I tightly hold   ♫

464
00:44:32,750 --> 00:44:37,810
♫   can't be secretly hidden   ♫

465
00:44:37,810 --> 00:44:44,260
♫    We can't turn back because you are here.   ♫

466
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,430
♫    Saying I love you even   ♫

467
00:44:48,430 --> 00:44:53,300
♫   without saying the words   ♫

468
00:44:53,300 --> 00:45:01,640
♫    I can't let you leave my embrace   ♫

469
00:45:03,300 --> 00:45:10,780
♫   I will always remember only you   ♫

470
00:45:14,810 --> 00:45:20,500
It's already daybreak.

471
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:25,550
You found the scribe?

472
00:45:25,550 --> 00:45:29,820
Yes, Your Highness. I heard that scribe sent a letter to us.

473
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:31,980
What great news this is!

474
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:34,940
That scribe voluntarily came to find us.

475
00:45:34,940 --> 00:45:39,580
We tried communicating with the merchants from all over the nation to find him but couldn't.

476
00:45:39,580 --> 00:45:43,240
I guess today is the day, Your Highness.

477
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:48,390
Queen Dowager! His Majesty is here to see Your Highness.

478
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:56,280
We are seeing each other quite often, Deputy Commander.

479
00:45:56,280 --> 00:46:01,120
Yes, Your Majesty. I am the officiating priest for the Grand Prince's wedding

480
00:46:01,120 --> 00:46:03,950
so that is why I am seeing her often.

481
00:46:03,950 --> 00:46:08,410
It's because there isn't a proper elder in the household.

482
00:46:08,410 --> 00:46:13,940
There are a lot of elders. It's because there isn't a trustworthy one, that's all.

483
00:46:15,270 --> 00:46:18,190
Carry on, Your Highnesses.

484
00:46:32,200 --> 00:46:37,220
Don't you want to take back this marriage now while you still can?

485
00:46:38,710 --> 00:46:41,120
Yeok will have to live under my shade

486
00:46:41,120 --> 00:46:44,220
while also being conscious of the First Vice Premier.

487
00:46:44,220 --> 00:46:47,170
I'm asking you if you'll be fine with that.

488
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:52,710
What do you mean by being on his guard? You'll be gaining the First Vice Premier who'll be backing you up.

489
00:46:52,710 --> 00:46:55,990
The Deputy Commander would be a good fit for that job too, don't you think?

490
00:46:55,990 --> 00:46:59,880
The maternal niece of the Deputy Commander has both beauty and intelligence.

491
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,700
She's a maiden who thinks on a large scale too.

492
00:47:02,700 --> 00:47:07,570
And she's also Yeok's savior who even saved his life, right?

493
00:47:07,570 --> 00:47:12,670
Those kids grew up like brother and sister. They were never engaged either.

494
00:47:14,300 --> 00:47:20,700
By chance, you're not thinking of temporarily using Chae Gyeong and abandoning her, are you?

495
00:47:20,700 --> 00:47:23,070
What do you mean by "using her"?

496
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:26,480
Changing the position of a wife

497
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:29,100
is not a difficult thing for you to do, isn't that right?

498
00:47:29,100 --> 00:47:31,200
Your Majesty!

499
00:47:32,370 --> 00:47:34,810
Since your misunderstanding goes that far,

500
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:38,050
I will be honest with you.

501
00:47:38,050 --> 00:47:41,680
I did want to help Yeok and Myeong Hye to come together.

502
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:47,220
But Yeok doesn't listen to me at all!

503
00:47:47,220 --> 00:47:50,810
He said that he doesn't want anybody else but Chae Gyeong.

504
00:47:50,810 --> 00:47:54,220
He told me he wants to keep the promise he made when he was young.

505
00:47:54,220 --> 00:47:56,720
Those two can't seem to live without each other.

506
00:47:56,720 --> 00:48:01,910
So we should just let them get married. What kind of parents are able to win over their child?

507
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:10,550
Alright then.

508
00:48:10,550 --> 00:48:13,740
We'll have the wedding without any problems then.

509
00:48:13,740 --> 00:48:19,520
I heard that Yeok is going through with the marriage because he really loves and cherishes Chae Gyeong.

510
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,630
No matter what trial comes his way, he won't waver, right?

511
00:48:23,630 --> 00:48:26,530
He will remain safe.

512
00:49:07,830 --> 00:49:10,450
Stay put, your makeup will smudge.

513
00:49:10,450 --> 00:49:13,130
Are you really that happy?

514
00:49:13,130 --> 00:49:15,080
Says who?

515
00:49:19,080 --> 00:49:20,720
You're not going to put my hair up?

516
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:25,120
The hair usually goes up once we see the groom arrive at the bride's house.

517
00:49:25,120 --> 00:49:29,550
What are you going to do if your hair is already up and the groom doesn't show up?

518
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,040
Nanny!

519
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:35,960
I cancel what I just said. Yes, I cancel that.

520
00:49:44,460 --> 00:49:48,180
It doesn't suit you. It won't be easy.

521
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:50,420
Hyungnim Seok Hee should've done this.

522
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:55,250
I know, right? Where are they? How come I can't see a trace of them?

523
00:49:56,760 --> 00:49:58,620
By the way, Seo No...

524
00:49:58,620 --> 00:50:02,910
Yes, Hyung— I mean, Grand Prince.

525
00:50:02,910 --> 00:50:06,410
After the wedding is over, I have a gift for you.

526
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,180
A gift?

527
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:10,330
Why a gift so suddenly?

528
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:26,150
 No matter what people say, you're my woman from now on. 

529
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:32,700
 Everything I do will be to protect you. 

530
00:50:34,230 --> 00:50:38,760
 You'll be my husband for life too, Your Highness. 

531
00:50:39,580 --> 00:50:42,830
 Let's live a fun life like good friends. 

532
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:51,350
Wow!

533
00:50:52,070 --> 00:50:53,510
 Pawn Shop  

534
00:50:53,510 --> 00:50:57,700
 Temporarily closed  

535
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:05,060
Is it true that they give away rice here?

536
00:51:05,060 --> 00:51:07,830
We're not open today.

537
00:51:09,430 --> 00:51:12,520
Hold up, hold up.

538
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:15,660
Since you're already here, why don't you come in?

539
00:51:15,660 --> 00:51:17,360
Yes, sir.

540
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:27,360
Do you have any worthy news you can tell me?

541
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:30,360
I don't know if it's worthy or not

542
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,930
but there's something that I'm a little uneasy about.

543
00:51:32,930 --> 00:51:37,480
There was this rough-looking fellow who showed up so suddenly

544
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:41,830
and was looking for a villager who disappeared five years ago.

545
00:51:41,830 --> 00:51:46,210
But I did mention that name unintentionally without realizing it.

546
00:51:46,210 --> 00:51:49,400
It's strange how that house burned down overnight.

547
00:51:49,400 --> 00:51:54,050
And it's also strange that all of the members of that household disappeared too.

548
00:51:54,050 --> 00:51:57,650
By any chance, did you live in Dongjeokjun?

549
00:51:57,650 --> 00:52:00,520
Pardon? How did you know that?

550
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,940
So then that rough-looking fellow, the person that he asked around for...?

551
00:52:04,940 --> 00:52:07,060
I don't really know his original name.

552
00:52:07,060 --> 00:52:10,690
But we called him "Seo No's father."

553
00:52:19,530 --> 00:52:21,570
Is it really alright if it's just us two?

554
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:23,940
We will be in big trouble later if Yeok and Seo No find out.

555
00:52:23,940 --> 00:52:25,670
Orabeoni's wedding will be held today.

556
00:52:25,670 --> 00:52:29,770
We can escort Seo No's father to somewhere safe and it won't be late if we tell them after the wedding is over.

557
00:52:29,770 --> 00:52:32,180
But still... To Seo No...

558
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:36,290
Seo No should be at Orabeoni's side.

559
00:52:36,290 --> 00:52:39,170
But do we still have to disguise ourselves and wear this mask too?

560
00:52:39,170 --> 00:52:43,200
We should be dealing with everything in a careful manner. Did you forget who we are?

561
00:52:56,320 --> 00:52:58,350
Hold up! Hold up!

562
00:52:58,350 --> 00:53:00,670
Hold up!

563
00:53:02,210 --> 00:53:03,410
We're in big trouble.

564
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:06,840
Myeong Hye and Seok Hee went to escort Seo No's father.

565
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:10,160
My father? My father came?

566
00:53:10,160 --> 00:53:11,800
This feels like a trap.

567
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:14,190
They said Im Sa Hong did a background check on Seo No's father!

568
00:53:14,190 --> 00:53:16,550
It is a trap.

569
00:53:16,550 --> 00:53:19,310
It's because I'm the one who's taking care of Seo No's father.

570
00:53:33,730 --> 00:53:37,700
Your Majesty. I could report everything to you.

571
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:40,350
You didn't have to make a trip all the way over here.

572
00:53:40,350 --> 00:53:44,000
Yeok is coming here on his own to find the secret order.

573
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:46,620
I wanted to see it with my own eyes.

574
00:54:22,100 --> 00:54:27,190
The Queen Dowager...

575
00:54:27,190 --> 00:54:33,100
Of course.

576
00:55:02,620 --> 00:55:05,570
It seems the Grand Prince is quite late.

577
00:55:15,990 --> 00:55:18,730
  Do you think you'll be able to hold the wedding without any problems? 

578
00:55:18,730 --> 00:55:24,270
 No matter what comes his way, he won't waver, right? He'll be safe. 

579
00:55:26,060 --> 00:55:30,160
Deputy Commander, we have to find Yeok.

580
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,230
I think something has happened.

581
00:55:33,230 --> 00:55:35,480
Deploy the soldiers, quickly!

582
00:55:35,480 --> 00:55:37,140
Yes.

583
00:55:46,430 --> 00:55:53,550
We just sent someone to the palace. He'll be here soon. This mouth is the problem, this mouth.

584
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,330
Lady Bride!

585
00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,590
His Majesty the King has sent this.

586
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:17,730
Nanny, get me some water.

587
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:19,420
Yes.

588
00:56:31,280 --> 00:56:34,150
  You said you trust Yeok? 

589
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:52,540
Your Majesty, they've arrived.

590
00:57:02,790 --> 00:57:03,860
No one is inside.

591
00:57:03,860 --> 00:57:05,600
Really?

592
00:57:07,830 --> 00:57:09,830
 Seo No, Father has something to tell you about the secret order so come to the rest station by the crossroad where the inn is located. 

593
00:57:09,830 --> 00:57:13,180
That's strange. Why did he ask to meet at a place like this?

594
00:57:31,400 --> 00:57:32,760
- Is everyone safe?
- Orabeoni.

595
00:57:32,760 --> 00:57:33,660
How did you know about this place?

596
00:57:33,660 --> 00:57:37,130
I think Im Sa Hong set a trap.

597
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:43,230
Your Majesty, I'm certain that they have not obtained the secret order either.

598
00:58:05,630 --> 00:58:07,160
Everyone, escape.

599
00:58:07,160 --> 00:58:08,190
Orabeoni.

600
00:58:08,190 --> 00:58:09,760
Escape!

601
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:12,050
Yes. Come on, let's leave.

602
00:58:12,050 --> 00:58:14,050
Orabeoni!

603
00:58:16,830 --> 00:58:21,120
  What will you do if you misplaced your trust? 

604
00:58:21,120 --> 00:58:26,590
  Then, I will accept this dagger. 

605
00:58:26,590 --> 00:58:32,180
Fine, I won't kill you. It'll be your own doing that kills you.

606
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,380
Y-Your Majesty! Are you alright?!

607
00:58:53,500 --> 00:58:55,430
Yeok!

608
00:58:55,430 --> 00:58:57,540
Move, move!

609
00:58:57,540 --> 00:58:59,500
Come on, this way! Hurry!

610
00:58:59,500 --> 00:59:02,660
This way! This way!

611
00:59:07,670 --> 00:59:09,830
Stop!

612
00:59:11,260 --> 00:59:16,100
There's no need to chase them. We've gained everything we needed from here.

613
00:59:20,590 --> 00:59:25,390
It seems he'll be late to the wedding.

614
00:59:44,340 --> 00:59:46,700
  You said you trust Yeok? 

615
00:59:46,700 --> 00:59:52,280
  I can guarantee that you will soon start to suspect him 

616
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:56,780
  because he is deceiving you. 

617
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,360
Quickly, go to the wedding for now.

618
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:12,950
We'll take care of everything else.

619
01:00:12,950 --> 01:00:17,370
That's right. We don't know what the King and the Chief Royal Secretary will find a fault about next.

620
01:00:30,920 --> 01:00:32,900
Don't go.

621
01:00:34,390 --> 01:00:38,250
The Chief Royal Secretary discovered that we were searching for the secret order.

622
01:00:39,750 --> 01:00:44,050
He'll try to kill you, so

623
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:48,030
don't go, Orabeoni.

624
01:00:58,440 --> 01:01:04,500
  So the moment when you'll have to kill Yeok with this dagger may come. 

625
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:14,450
I have to go. Chae Gyeong is waiting for me.

626
01:01:14,450 --> 01:01:16,820
Chae Gyeong is waiting.

627
01:01:27,260 --> 01:01:29,260
Young Lady!

628
01:01:31,180 --> 01:01:33,260
He's here!

629
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:48,950
Grand Prince.

630
01:01:48,950 --> 01:01:53,230
I apologize for being late.

631
01:02:03,790 --> 01:02:05,080
Brother.

632
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,390
You're working hard.

633
01:02:14,770 --> 01:02:18,330
  As expected, it was you? 

634
01:02:18,330 --> 01:02:21,270
  As expected, it was you? 

635
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:34,780
It's as if you were born to wear a chignon. How can the chignon hairstyle suit you so perfectly?

636
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:39,230
  Regardless of what you tell me, I won't suspect him. 

637
01:02:39,230 --> 01:02:41,960
  I'll believe in His Highness the Grand Prince. 

638
01:02:43,650 --> 01:02:49,380
 Guidance of the bride to exit the door.  

639
01:03:17,150 --> 01:03:21,630
  Bride and Groom, bow to each other! 

640
01:03:49,480 --> 01:03:51,890
  You said you trust Yeok? 

641
01:03:51,890 --> 01:03:57,480
  I can guarantee that you will soon start to suspect him 

642
01:03:57,480 --> 01:04:01,400
  because he is deceiving you. 

643
01:04:04,460 --> 01:04:10,900
