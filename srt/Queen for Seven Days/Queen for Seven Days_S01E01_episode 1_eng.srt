1
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:44,800
  1506 (King Jung Jong's 1st year of reign) 

2
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:52,060


3
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:56,180
  She's so pitiful! 

4
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,040
  Still, at one point, she was Her Highness the Queen. 

5
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:03,010
What Queen? She couldn't even endure for 10 days and got kicked out of the palace.

6
00:01:03,010 --> 00:01:06,820
It's such a shame, really.

7
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:14,250
  Father... Father, Father! 

8
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,930
 Mom! Mother! Mother, Mother... 

9
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,170
 Mother... 

10
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,140
  Chae Gyeong. 

11
00:02:14,020 --> 00:02:16,840
  I should have killed you. 

12
00:02:19,870 --> 00:02:24,170
  Proceed with the execution of the Deposed Queen Sin. 

13
00:02:53,530 --> 00:03:02,360
  If I am born again, I will never meet you...Your Majesty. 

14
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,150
  Queen for Seven Days 

15
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:10,910
In the fifth year of King Yeon San Gun's reign,
 7 years ago 

16
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:18,900
  Lee Yoong led a grand-scale purge against the political factions that opposed him and secured his position on the throne. 

17
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,660
  However, soon after, a severe drought affected the nation and angered him 

18
00:03:25,660 --> 00:03:31,660
  because it was said that natural disaster from the Heavens was due to a lacking ruler. 

19
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:34,450
  Lee Yoong (Yeon San Gun / Joseon's 10th King) 

20
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,480
  Episode 1 

21
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,490
  Lee Yeok (Grand Prince Jin Seong, future King Jun Jong) 

22
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:12,870
They should be coming anytime now.

23
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:16,200
Your Highness the Grand Prince! Please come down. It's dangerous!

24
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,640
- Your Highness the Grand Prince, if you fall...
- It's almost time.

25
00:04:23,870 --> 00:04:25,370
They're here!

26
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:39,160
Is this what you needed?

27
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:41,200
Quick! Hurry!

28
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:44,550
You have to explain.  We had a difficult time catching this.

29
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:48,240
How dare you call our dragon "this thing" ?

30
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:50,650
Stand up now! Quick! Be diligent!

31
00:05:03,470 --> 00:05:08,850
Salamander, salamander. Bring forth the clouds.

32
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:13,200
Help the fog, and let rain pour down.

33
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:15,850
Then, I will let you go.

34
00:05:16,790 --> 00:05:19,400
What? Aren't you going to do it?

35
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,660
Sal- Sal- Sal.

36
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:26,410
Salamander, salamander. Bring forth the clouds.

37
00:05:26,410 --> 00:05:30,690
Help the fog, and let the rain pour down.

38
00:05:30,690 --> 00:05:35,790
Salamander, salamander. Bring forth the clouds.

39
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:39,950
Help the fog, and let the rain pour down.

40
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:46,130
Then I will let you go. Salamander, salamander ...

41
00:05:58,090 --> 00:05:59,550
Brother—

42
00:06:05,990 --> 00:06:10,000
Your Majesty, are you on your way to the council meeting?

43
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,450
Yes.

44
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,730
Have fun playing.

45
00:06:15,730 --> 00:06:18,190
I wasn't playing—

46
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,360
His Majesty is entering!

47
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,250
We greet you, Your Majesty!

48
00:06:51,190 --> 00:06:55,780
Kneel. Bow four times.

49
00:06:55,780 --> 00:07:00,880
Bow. Stand.

50
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:08,240
All the court officials, start your reporting.

51
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:14,010
Secretary of Agriculture(3rd rank official) Seong Hee Ahn reporting.

52
00:07:14,010 --> 00:07:18,320
It's been 10 years since family registration, to relieve the people's inconvenience,

53
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:21,390
We have started  reorganization of family registers,

54
00:07:24,610 --> 00:07:26,830
Yoo Ja Kwang, a manager from the department of military reporting.

55
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:31,670
Report of sweep of Jurchens attacking the borders....

56
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:35,400
I am the Deputy Minister of Rites, Yoo Soon Jeong.

57
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:39,900
We gave vacation days to qualified civil officers amounting to 17 officers

58
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:42,270
allowed to visit their residences...

59
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:05,760
Exactly what do you ministers do?

60
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:12,400
When I requested holding the court session in this courtyard

61
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,200
when we have a perfectly fine hall inside!

62
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:23,680
Under this scorching sun, where your heads and backs are soaked with sweat,

63
00:08:25,260 --> 00:08:31,010
you should have first thought of the crops and

64
00:08:31,010 --> 00:08:33,360
the hungry citizens who are withering under this sun.

65
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,230
We're sorry, Your Majesty.

66
00:08:36,230 --> 00:08:40,660
Even little kids are grouping together to hold a prayer ceremony for rain.

67
00:08:40,660 --> 00:08:44,620
The only thing you ministers do is gather and chant "We're sorry!" together!

68
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:46,790
 We apologize. 

69
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:52,490
Since long ago, it has been said that a natural disaster from the Heavens was because the king was lacking.

70
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:59,550
Even if everything else is good, if the drought is this severe, everyone will start to gossip about me!

71
00:08:59,550 --> 00:09:03,270
Of course, the same goes for you all.

72
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:06,660
That's completely unreasonable.

73
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:08,960
Listen well!

74
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:14,210
I will not tolerate any nonsense regarding me or my nation of Joseon!

75
00:09:14,210 --> 00:09:19,130
Therefore! Until this drought is resolved,

76
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:24,110
do not move an inch from your positions.

77
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:40,710
Aren't you the Head of Sogyeokseo (Department of Taoist rites)?

78
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:47,290
You should have observed the heaven's wishes well and took the proper measures so I would not have to concern myself with heaven's natural disaster.

79
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:50,020
I apologize, Your Majesty. 
   Im Sa Hong, Chief&nbsp; Royal Secretary 

80
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:54,440
A drought occurs due to the lack of Yin energy,

81
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:58,090
so I closed the South Gate, which is filled with Yin energy, and opened the North Gate—

82
00:09:58,090 --> 00:10:02,550
Forget Yin energy, Yang energy, and that battle of chi.

83
00:10:02,550 --> 00:10:06,280
Isn't there a more realistic solution?

84
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:14,170
Your Majesty, I think it would be best if you could personally have a  prayer ceremony for rain at Seonnongdan and at the altar to the State deities.

85
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:19,990
Are you suggesting that I, the king, should try to flatter the skies?

86
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:25,160
You'll be able to pacify the tired hearts of the subjects and show your sincerity to the Heavens. ( Sin Soo Geun  )

87
00:10:26,270 --> 00:10:27,830
Anything else?

88
00:10:27,830 --> 00:10:29,060
Yes.

89
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:35,470
According to the professor at the astrology department, a royal marriage helps during a severe drought.
 

90
00:10:36,500 --> 00:10:40,750
What if we use this chance to wed Grand Prince Jin Seong?

91
00:10:40,750 --> 00:10:43,650
Through the marriage, add Yin energy to the royal family,

92
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:46,480
and maintain the balance between Yin and Yang.

93
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:54,100
Is it already time for my younger brother to wed?

94
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,650
Will you become Grand Prince Jin Seong's father-in-law?

95
00:11:15,700 --> 00:11:17,160
Your Majesty!

96
00:11:18,250 --> 00:11:22,140
You have a daughter you've hidden in your quarters out in the countryside of Geochang.

97
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:28,380
Several marriage proposals from all the powerful families came in but they were all refused, weren't they?

98
00:11:29,310 --> 00:11:33,900
By any chance, will you refuse my request as well?

99
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,500
  Sin Chae Gyeong (Future Queen Dan Gyeong) 

100
00:11:55,550 --> 00:12:00,100
Just because she does that, will he poop now when he's had constipation for the past few days?

101
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,760
Just wait.

102
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,470
Lady Chae Gyeong's whistle makes even the passing mutts stop.

103
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:26,900
- He's pooping! He's pooping!
- I told you she could do it!

104
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:32,100
- He pooped! He pooped! Our donkey pooped!
 - He pooped!

105
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,010
That's amazing, really.

106
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:39,600
- Just look at how well she cured him.
 - That was a first. It really pooped.

107
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:44,050
Wait, wait! Wait a minute!

108
00:12:45,730 --> 00:12:48,670
Both cow droppings and horse droppings are particularly strong.

109
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:52,090
If it's immediately added to the crops, you know they'll die right away, right?

110
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,770
Yes, of course.

111
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,950
Don't be lazy and just leave after shoveling the poop out to the farmers.

112
00:12:58,950 --> 00:13:03,500
On top of rich soil, lay out some dead leaves or saw dust. Start with some poop and make successive layers with saw dust.

113
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:08,610
Make sure you explain to them that they must layer like that and ferment for at least 3 months.

114
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:11,530
Alright, I understand.

115
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:19,100
Nanny will scold me again.

116
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:23,380
Young Lady! Young Lady, Young Lady!

117
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:26,920
Ga Hee, quickly! You need to thank the Young Lady!

118
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:32,990
Thanks to you, our donkey's constipation has been cured and we even earned some money!

119
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:35,480
Thank you so much, Young Lady.

120
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:38,690
We're friends, aren't we? Goodbye!

121
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,870
But, is that something that will be solved just by adding  manure?

122
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:05,860
See? Young Lady helped because of me. We're friends.

123
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:09,700
How can you and the precious Young Lady become friends?

124
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:14,860
Even if she speaks like that, you'll be in trouble if you speak so carelessly. Show your respect, understand?

125
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:18,110
How is she precious? You said that

126
00:14:18,110 --> 00:14:21,370
Young Lady Chae Gyeong is an ugly duckling,

127
00:14:21,370 --> 00:14:25,500
that she's a child her own family abandoned, and that I should treat her well because she's so pitiful.

128
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,140
Be quiet!

129
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:32,700
Isn't that true?! Would her parents let their entire family live well in Hanyang

130
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:39,230
but force her to live with her nanny in this provincial countryside?

131
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:41,640
You said she was a complete nuisance, didn't you?

132
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:44,800
W-when did I say that? You're accusing an innocent person!

133
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:48,920
Mom! Are you always going to say two things with one mouth?!

134
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:50,360
I'm hungry! Give me some food!

135
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,650
Ugh! Just cook your own food!

136
00:15:09,080 --> 00:15:11,490
You worked hard, didn't you?

137
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:14,160
- Please just wait a minute.
 - Goodness, it's hot.

138
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:16,550
That's from Hanyang, isn't it?!

139
00:15:16,550 --> 00:15:19,220
Oh my, Young Lady! What are you up to now?

140
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:20,900
My young lady, that is...

141
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:26,860
  You cannot come to Hanyang. Remain in our house in Geochang. We will come down soon. 

142
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:37,080
Why does he always refuse?!

143
00:15:39,250 --> 00:15:44,090
You should give up now. Did you store something precious away in Hanyang?

144
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:49,410
Nanny, why was I born?

145
00:15:49,410 --> 00:15:53,930
I mean, why did they have me? If all they're going to do is abandon me in this countryside, why did they have me?!

146
00:15:53,930 --> 00:15:57,370
Nonsense. How can you say something like that?

147
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:59,060
Then what?!

148
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:03,470
So, the thing is...

149
00:16:04,390 --> 00:16:06,400
What are you doing?! Hurry up and eat!

150
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,480
- Are you being picky about your food?!
 - No, no.

151
00:16:12,170 --> 00:16:13,400
Also...

152
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:17,400
Make sure you deliver this directly to His Lordship.

153
00:16:18,130 --> 00:16:19,990
It's extremely important.

154
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:21,780
Okay.

155
00:16:24,190 --> 00:16:27,950
Young Lady, what are you doing? Let's leave now, come on.

156
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:32,200
Come on, let's go. What is this smell? Did you step in poop?!

157
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:34,250
Chae Gyeong?

158
00:16:36,790 --> 00:16:41,070
The fact that we hid her in the countryside is about to become useless.

159
00:16:41,830 --> 00:16:47,400
At this period of time when we should be avoiding even an ordinary member of the Royal Family, Grand Prince Jin Seong?

160
00:16:58,550 --> 00:17:01,460
Exactly why did you do such a useless thing?

161
00:17:01,460 --> 00:17:03,400
How is that

162
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,490
useless?

163
00:17:05,490 --> 00:17:07,200
It's a place where people's eyes are watching you. 
  Queen Dowager Ja Soo 

164
00:17:07,200 --> 00:17:10,460
Don't do anything, see anything, or hear anything!

165
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:12,990
- Yes, I know it all. 
 - Yeok!

166
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:17,400
Still, can a younger brother not even do that small act of loyalty to his older brother?

167
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,800
The rain ritual is a matter of the nation. It's the king's matter, not yours!

168
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:24,110
The rain ritual is also a matter of the people.

169
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:26,410
Are you an ordinary citizen?

170
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:31,030
If you truly want to do something for the king,

171
00:17:31,030 --> 00:17:34,060
why don't you take up knitting like a girl and give it to him as a gift instead?

172
00:17:34,060 --> 00:17:39,400
Yes. Then I will go and buy some yarn.

173
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,500
  Brother! 

174
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,650
  My little mutt! 

175
00:18:36,900 --> 00:18:41,590
 Salamander, salamander. The clouds... 

176
00:18:41,590 --> 00:18:43,130
  The clouds... 

177
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:44,780
 Bring forth the clouds. 

178
00:18:44,830 --> 00:18:47,860
  Please bring forth the clouds, help the fog.. 

179
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,300
  and let the rain pour down. 

180
00:18:54,630 --> 00:18:58,800
  Our Yeok, you're so intelligent. 

181
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:10,700
That young kid grew so much.

182
00:19:10,700 --> 00:19:12,960
Marriage already?

183
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:33,320
Wait! I'm getting on too! Me too!

184
00:19:56,680 --> 00:20:01,040
I'm going to see the end of this! I'm also someone who keeps her word.

185
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:06,890
 It's not here. 

186
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:09,160
What's disappeared?

187
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:12,490
- I'm sure I put it inside here. 
 - Search carefully!

188
00:20:12,490 --> 00:20:13,760
It's not here.

189
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:16,670
That's strange. I'm sure it was here.

190
00:20:16,670 --> 00:20:20,880
Goodness, what to do? Young Lady! Young Lady!

191
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,700
Young Lady!

192
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:40,430
Let's just go by ourselves.

193
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,610
Are you really not going to go?

194
00:20:46,610 --> 00:20:47,720
I'm not going.

195
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:50,260
You promised!

196
00:20:50,260 --> 00:20:51,620
I said I'm not going!

197
00:20:51,620 --> 00:20:55,210
Wow! Is he the soy sauce dish (narrow-minded) or what?

198
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:58,920
It's been so long since he got scolded by Her Highness the Queen Dowager, yet he's still not over it?

199
00:20:58,920 --> 00:21:01,080
Soy sauce is sacred.

200
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:04,120
That's what being like soy sauce means to you?

201
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:08,790
And you, you, you! Why are you being sulky today? Why today out of all days?!

202
00:21:08,790 --> 00:21:13,560
Hey! If you keep acting up, I won't give you this.

203
00:21:13,560 --> 00:21:15,400
Oh! That's—

204
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:20,420
Grand Prince, I'm sure you know what this is.

205
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:23,930
Did you read it too?

206
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:30,640
You can't threaten me with those.

207
00:22:08,990 --> 00:22:12,030
What is this?!

208
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,840
Are you okay?

209
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,580
My hands are all scraped.

210
00:22:36,040 --> 00:22:38,930
I'll return it if you apologize.

211
00:22:38,930 --> 00:22:43,580
What apology over a simple fall? You're not even a woman.

212
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:46,030
If you hurt someone, you should apologize!

213
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:49,680
Are all men in Hanyang like you, Young Master?

214
00:22:52,040 --> 00:22:55,900
I just bumped into you while fooling around. Why are you acting so upright? You have no friends, right?

215
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:58,070
What did you say?!

216
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,390
Let's go for a nice view.

217
00:23:04,390 --> 00:23:07,690
- Let's go. A nice view! Nice view!
- Let's go. A nice view!

218
00:23:07,690 --> 00:23:12,530
Wow, how can there be such gangster-like young masters?

219
00:23:12,530 --> 00:23:15,190
Nice view! Nice view!

220
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:17,440
A nice view?

221
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:29,590
Hurry!

222
00:24:13,530 --> 00:24:17,920
  Immutability... love... 

223
00:24:27,570 --> 00:24:30,330
A nice view?

224
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:38,060
No wonder! I was wondering why such a gangster-like young master was obsessing so much over a book.

225
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:46,130
Wow, what a nice picture! It's killer!

226
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:54,330
Goodness, it seems your sightseeing has ended.

227
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:57,670
Hey! Hey, stop right there!

228
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:01,370
Hey, stop!

229
00:25:01,370 --> 00:25:05,980
Hey! Stop right there!

230
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:12,030
Stop right there!

231
00:25:12,030 --> 00:25:16,120
- Hey! Hey! They're throwing rocks!
 - Run!

232
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,540
Hey! If I catch you, you're dead!

233
00:25:23,540 --> 00:25:25,730
Hey! Stop right there!

234
00:25:25,730 --> 00:25:30,440
I'm dead! How can they do that?

235
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:37,020
Stop right there! Hey! Stop!

236
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,590
Yeok!

237
00:25:51,590 --> 00:25:55,110
Yeok, where are you?! I feel like I'm about to die!

238
00:25:55,110 --> 00:25:57,370
Where are you?

239
00:26:37,170 --> 00:26:41,320
You just...

240
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:55,140
- Yeok! Yeok! 
 - Yeok! Yeok! Yeok! Yeok!

241
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:59,780
Hey, hey! Yeok!

242
00:26:59,780 --> 00:27:04,590
- Yeok! 
 - Catch that bird poop! I said, catch that bird poop!

243
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:07,690
Wait for us!

244
00:27:07,690 --> 00:27:11,000
Run, Sin Chae Gyeong!

245
00:27:11,000 --> 00:27:15,910
- Stop right there! If I catch you, you're dead! 
 - Yeok!

246
00:27:15,910 --> 00:27:18,650
Help me up!

247
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:35,150
We're definitely going to meet again!

248
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:38,430
It won't end like this!

249
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:43,320
Has he gone nuts? Do you think I'm going to meet you again?

250
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,950
Hey!

251
00:27:49,640 --> 00:27:53,590
Why do I have such bad luck!

252
00:27:53,590 --> 00:27:57,030
 Sogyeokseo: During the Joseon dynasty, the government office responsible for holding Taoist rituals for the earth, sky, and stars. 

253
00:27:57,030 --> 00:28:04,830
Do you truly plan on marrying the Chief Royal Secretary's daughter and Grand Prince Jin Seong?

254
00:28:04,890 --> 00:28:10,680
Whether it's the authority of a ruler or the authority of a god, it's better for power to be centered in one place.

255
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:17,290
If I give Yeok to an unworthy family, how do you expect me to watch him walk around exclaiming that he's the grand prince's father-in-law

256
00:28:17,290 --> 00:28:20,180
taking pride in the connection?

257
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:25,920
However, he is Her Highness the Queen's older brother, Your Majesty's brother-in-law, and

258
00:28:25,920 --> 00:28:28,440
will become His Highness the Grand Prince's father-in-law.

259
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:35,090
If ambition is added to those titles, what will you do then?

260
00:28:36,670 --> 00:28:42,040
Are you trying to come between the Chief Royal Secretary and me?

261
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:46,620
I'm speaking of Your Majesty and the Grand Prince Jin Seong.

262
00:28:47,370 --> 00:28:50,550
If justification is added to ambition,

263
00:28:50,550 --> 00:28:56,600
anyone, Sin Soo Geun included, could plot treason.

264
00:28:56,630 --> 00:29:00,500
Justification? Treason?!

265
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:07,030
Your Majesty, you cannot forget the late Majesty's will.

266
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:09,270
What?!

267
00:29:27,130 --> 00:29:32,700
This is the king's daily activity copied in secret from the records department.

268
00:29:33,460 --> 00:29:37,070
Your Majesty, I'm sorry to tell you this,

269
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:43,740
but the late king's will was left in a secret order.

270
00:29:46,110 --> 00:29:48,580
  Your Majesty, please leave a will!
  

271
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:51,390
  Please appoint Grand Prince Jin Seong as the Crown Prince! 

272
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:53,810
  Your Majesty! 

273
00:29:58,660 --> 00:30:06,100
  When Grand Prince Jin Seong reaches adulthood, abdicate and leave the throne to him. 

274
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:10,850
  That child must become king... 

275
00:30:15,670 --> 00:30:24,000
  Yoong, you... you will ruin all of Joseon. 

276
00:30:26,580 --> 00:30:32,640
  But a secret order? Exactly why can't you trust me? 

277
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:36,860
  Why? Because I'm the son of a deposed queen? 

278
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:41,390
  Then what about him? Aside from being born, what  has he done? 

279
00:30:42,510 --> 00:30:46,400
  Why must I be afraid of that young one now?! 

280
00:30:46,400 --> 00:30:48,730
  My Yeok, you're so intelligent. 

281
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:53,480
  How can you care only for that child until the very end? 

282
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:04,620
Where is Yeok? Where is Grand Prince Jin Seong right now?!

283
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:10,160
Where did those rascals run off to?

284
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,440
Damn this.

285
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:16,550
I want to buy a present for my family.

286
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:21,770
What would be a good present for someone in a particularly high position?

287
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,440
Can't you understand dialect?!

288
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,830
As long as you have money, I can understand everything from dialect to Chinese.

289
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:34,520
But...

290
00:31:36,110 --> 00:31:38,340
I have money!

291
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:57,070
We meet again, Bird Poop.

292
00:31:58,770 --> 00:32:03,450
Did you really chase me here? To catch me?

293
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:05,930
How much is this salamander water pot?

294
00:32:05,930 --> 00:32:07,850
One nyang.

295
00:32:08,730 --> 00:32:10,680
Are you acting out your revenge on me right now?!

296
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:14,060
You're not even a woman. What petty revenge?

297
00:32:16,470 --> 00:32:21,340
Let's make it two nyang. That's the last of that product.

298
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,510
- Alright, here's two nyang.
- Three nyang!

299
00:32:23,510 --> 00:32:24,850
Three and a half nyang!

300
00:32:24,850 --> 00:32:27,470
What are you trying to do? Are you cutting in?

301
00:32:27,470 --> 00:32:30,750
I was moved by your righteousness earlier.

302
00:32:30,750 --> 00:32:34,280
You could call this a small repayment from a wealthy subject.

303
00:32:34,280 --> 00:32:37,070
Hah! You are getting revenge!

304
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:41,030
- Hurry and give it to me. 
- No! I'm going to buy it.

305
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,780
What did I tell you earlier? I said I would be giving it to someone in a very high position, did I not?

306
00:32:46,780 --> 00:32:52,130
I'm going to gift this to someone who is at least 10 ranks higher than the person she'll gift it to.

307
00:32:52,130 --> 00:32:54,660
Hah! I'm going to give this to His Majesty the King.

308
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:57,860
- How?
- I'm His Majesty the King's nephew!

309
00:32:57,860 --> 00:33:00,550
I'm His Majesty the King's younger brother!

310
00:33:00,550 --> 00:33:05,400
Goodness! If you're the king's younger brother, I...

311
00:33:07,310 --> 00:33:13,530
I'm Joseon's queen!  I'm the queen! 

312
00:33:18,970 --> 00:33:25,710
Now, now, now! I'll give this to whoever gives me three nyang first.

313
00:33:28,300 --> 00:33:30,490
I have money too!

314
00:33:30,490 --> 00:33:33,210
Goodness, thank you.

315
00:33:34,850 --> 00:33:37,050
Quickly, give it to me.

316
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,470
Stop right there!

317
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,720
"I'm Joseon's queen!"

318
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:56,990
Damn that. What a waste of a man.

319
00:34:05,550 --> 00:34:08,290
  If you truly want to do something for His Majesty the King, 

320
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:12,950
 take up knitting like a girl and give it to him as a gift instead. 

321
00:34:12,950 --> 00:34:18,110
It's perfect. I got my revenge and bought a present.

322
00:34:26,900 --> 00:34:29,500
  You must deliver this directly to His Lordship. 

323
00:34:29,500 --> 00:34:31,960
  It is extremely important. 

324
00:34:34,190 --> 00:34:35,700
What do I do?

325
00:34:35,700 --> 00:34:37,820
What are you looking for?

326
00:34:37,820 --> 00:34:41,300
Were you pickpocketed or something?

327
00:34:48,950 --> 00:34:52,450
Wow, look at those Hanyang jerks using their heads.

328
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:56,780
What happened earlier was just a ruse. His real revenge was pickpocketing me!

329
00:35:01,550 --> 00:35:06,440
Once I catch you, you're dead! I'm going to break your wrists!

330
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,560
Where did those rascals run off to?

331
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:15,160
Where are you, Yeok?! Exactly where are you?

332
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:21,150
I found you!

333
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:24,680
Exactly where did you go? We searched everywhere for you.

334
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:27,700
What about you two? Where were you?

335
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:34,540
- My leg...
 - What? What's wrong?

336
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:36,910
What? Did you sprain your leg?

337
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:39,990
Ugh, I knew this would happen when you started running off earlier.

338
00:35:39,990 --> 00:35:44,250
Did I run because I wanted to? It's all because that bird poop bastard—

339
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:49,680
Still, I got my revenge.

340
00:36:01,930 --> 00:36:04,550
Now, put your foot in.

341
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:08,030
Left foot.

342
00:36:08,030 --> 00:36:12,980
Right foot. Alright. Now, with all your strength.

343
00:36:15,190 --> 00:36:17,060
With all your strength!

344
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:18,970
Friends are nice after all.

345
00:36:18,970 --> 00:36:24,910
If we were true friends, you wouldn't make your friends suffer needlessly—

346
00:36:26,300 --> 00:36:29,640
Speed up! Why are you tottering so much?

347
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,830
Attack!

348
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:55,560
Your Majesty, what brings you all the way—

349
00:36:59,810 --> 00:37:05,350
It seems as if you are the king in this area.

350
00:37:05,350 --> 00:37:09,320
What king? I'm the leader of the kids in the neighborhood.

351
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:14,840
I heard that these two were your close friends. So, did you officially enter the palace?

352
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:17,370
The chance to enter will be given to me next year, Your Majesty.

353
00:37:17,370 --> 00:37:20,890
I too will challenge myself in the martial arts entrance exam, Your Majesty.

354
00:37:20,890 --> 00:37:25,920
Since you two have not passed the entrance exam to enter the palace, it seems I cannot expect loyalty from you yet.

355
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:30,160
Needless to say, all the people of Joseon will be loyal to you, Your Majesty.

356
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,880
We're probably much better than most public government officials—

357
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:39,900
We will be.

358
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,930
Really? Then, can you die for me?

359
00:37:45,930 --> 00:37:47,560
- It'd be an honor, Your Majesty. 
 - It'd be an honor, Your Majesty.

360
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:52,610
Then, let's assume that a house both Yeok and I are caught on fire.

361
00:37:52,610 --> 00:37:55,560
- Who would you save first? 
 - I—

362
00:38:05,690 --> 00:38:08,990
I would save Your Majesty first.

363
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:12,660
Then, I would enter the house again to save the grand prince, Your Majesty.

364
00:38:12,660 --> 00:38:20,130
Yes, I too... Even if I cannot escape in time, I would rather die with my friend.

365
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:30,070
So while you will save me, you'll offer your life up for the grand prince?

366
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:33,540
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

367
00:38:35,050 --> 00:38:37,330
That's speculation! That's not what they meant—

368
00:38:37,330 --> 00:38:42,720
A speculation?! Are you telling me my judgment was wrong?

369
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:45,810
- Your Majesty... 
 - In front of me,

370
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:50,510
you just stated that you would offer up your life for my younger brother from a different mother and this nation's legitimate heir to the throne.

371
00:38:50,510 --> 00:38:54,620
Taoist Scholar.  What are their crimes?

372
00:38:54,620 --> 00:38:57,700
They could be punished under the charge of treason.

373
00:38:57,700 --> 00:38:59,480
Taoist Scholar ...

374
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:08,030
Your Majesty!

375
00:39:08,030 --> 00:39:13,490
If you want to save your friends, beat me.

376
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:19,370
I'll give you a  royal horse.

377
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:27,230
If you arrive at the palace before me, I'll save both the lives of you and your friends.

378
00:39:27,230 --> 00:39:28,780
However,

379
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:38,220
if you're even a step late, I will behead you first.

380
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:55,090
Your Highness!

381
00:39:55,090 --> 00:39:57,300
Your Highness the Grand Prince, pull yourself together!

382
00:39:57,300 --> 00:39:59,090
Yeok!

383
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:29,800
  The late king's will was left in a secret order. 

384
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:35,880
  When Grand Prince Jin Seong reaches adulthood, abdicate and leave the throne to him. 

385
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:39,170
  I can't give it to him! I would rather die. 

386
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:45,400
  This is the only thing that's truly mine in this world. How can you try to steal this away too? 

387
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:56,850
Move! Move!

388
00:41:02,430 --> 00:41:06,010
 Brother, why are you doing this all of a sudden? 

389
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:09,070
  What has made you so enraged? 

390
00:41:09,070 --> 00:41:12,200
  Please just tell me instead. 

391
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:17,220
 You have to pass the market and go east on the alleyway. At the end is an empty house under construction. 

392
00:41:17,220 --> 00:41:21,010
  Once you jump over that house's walls, you'll be right in front of the palace. 

393
00:41:21,910 --> 00:41:26,320
Where is the government office? This place is so confusing.

394
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:52,890
You gangster-like young master!

395
00:41:55,470 --> 00:41:57,840
- Who are you?
- Then?

396
00:41:58,830 --> 00:42:01,240
What is it? Are you crying?

397
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:03,390
Move!

398
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:36,030
Get lost!

399
00:42:36,030 --> 00:42:38,010
Give me back what you stole from me first!

400
00:42:38,010 --> 00:42:39,720
- Let go of me!
- Give it back!

401
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,790
Let go!

402
00:42:43,890 --> 00:42:47,910
Where do you think you're going?! Stop right there, you thief!

403
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:51,900
Stop! Stop!

404
00:42:51,900 --> 00:42:56,320
That gangster-like young master! If I catch you, you're dead!

405
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:26,150
You lost.

406
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:29,870
How... what made you so enraged?

407
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:34,430
- If there is a misunderstanding— 
 - Misunderstanding? A misunderstanding?

408
00:43:34,430 --> 00:43:38,410
Is this hellish situation a misunderstanding to you?!

409
00:43:40,730 --> 00:43:42,210
Hell?

410
00:43:42,210 --> 00:43:45,740
As promised, I will behead you.

411
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:49,230
Even if I die, I must know why.

412
00:43:49,230 --> 00:43:52,770
If it is an understandable reason, I will gladly die!

413
00:43:54,470 --> 00:43:59,260
So you're saying that your judgment is above my wishes.

414
00:43:59,260 --> 00:44:00,420
That's not it—

415
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:04,530
Then! What is the reason I cannot kill you?

416
00:44:04,530 --> 00:44:07,720
You love reasons so much. Why don't you tell me?!

417
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:14,200
I'm Your Majesty's younger brother.

418
00:44:16,590 --> 00:44:19,070
We were born from the same father.

419
00:44:19,070 --> 00:44:21,260
That's the first reason as to why you must die.

420
00:44:21,260 --> 00:44:22,930
And I am this nation's, Joseon's, Grand Prince.

421
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:27,520
And you're a prince with clipped wings who can't do anything for the Royal Court and the people.

422
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:29,150
I'm a subject of this nation!

423
00:44:29,150 --> 00:44:32,250
You're a subject with an extremely noble status!

424
00:44:32,250 --> 00:44:37,000
While receiving an enormous allowance, you are one of the subjects who uses the nation's funds the most!

425
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,190
I didn't want any of it!

426
00:44:40,190 --> 00:44:44,650
Then what do you want? Do you want my position on the throne?

427
00:44:44,650 --> 00:44:45,550
Your Majesty!

428
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:48,620
What are you so confident about?!

429
00:44:49,340 --> 00:44:51,080
- Your Majesty!
- Your Highness!

430
00:44:51,080 --> 00:44:52,900
Your Majesty!

431
00:45:00,550 --> 00:45:02,850
I was wrong!

432
00:45:04,440 --> 00:45:09,090
Please, please spare my friends.

433
00:45:10,650 --> 00:45:15,260
Fine. I'll just end it with you.

434
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:31,780
  Brother! 

435
00:45:41,240 --> 00:45:43,170
  Your Majesty! 

436
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:07,970
Yes, Her Highness the Queen Dowager is the root of your confidence

437
00:46:07,970 --> 00:46:13,560
and His Majesty the late King, who continues to remain your reliable backing,

438
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:15,430
even after death.

439
00:46:15,430 --> 00:46:17,280
That's not true.

440
00:46:18,640 --> 00:46:24,380
My strongest backing is you, Hyungnim.

441
00:46:25,930 --> 00:46:33,170
Since you, the king of this nation, loves and adores me,

442
00:46:34,140 --> 00:46:37,280
I can continue to be this confident.

443
00:46:58,140 --> 00:47:03,030
Your Majesty! Exactly what is the meaning of all this?

444
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:17,620
Your Highness! Your Highness!

445
00:47:39,470 --> 00:47:44,490
  My strongest backing is you, Hyungnim. 

446
00:48:10,720 --> 00:48:15,670
I'm about to go nuts. How can I go home now?

447
00:48:15,670 --> 00:48:19,790
  Quickly! 

448
00:48:27,700 --> 00:48:32,410
He's mixed then. He's half nice, half gangster.

449
00:48:44,670 --> 00:48:48,490
He has finally started to show his true colors.

450
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:56,680
Because you're growing up, even discussion of your wedding is making him anxious.

451
00:48:56,680 --> 00:49:01,160
Wedding? Do you mean my marriage?

452
00:49:03,220 --> 00:49:07,990
Now, do you understand my thoughts? Do you understand why I warned you to be careful?

453
00:49:07,990 --> 00:49:14,440
The fact that I am becoming an adult and getting married is becoming dangerous to my brother?

454
00:49:14,440 --> 00:49:16,440
Is that the reason for what happened today?

455
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:22,980
Because if this nation's prince, who is directly descended from the throne, marries into a wealthy and powerful family,

456
00:49:22,980 --> 00:49:26,950
he can use that power and take over the throne.

457
00:49:26,950 --> 00:49:28,620
That's nonsense.

458
00:49:28,620 --> 00:49:36,660
What can't ever be explained in words is power and the throne.

459
00:49:40,150 --> 00:49:43,130
Didn't I tell you countless times before?

460
00:49:44,020 --> 00:49:46,790
Even if you come to trust and rely on everyone in this world,

461
00:49:46,790 --> 00:49:53,960
if there is one person you must be on your guard against, it is the king.

462
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,250
Mother!

463
00:49:57,970 --> 00:50:01,260
Look at Joseon's history.

464
00:50:01,260 --> 00:50:05,790
The older brother kills his younger brother, the young brother kills his older brother, the uncle kills his nephew.

465
00:50:05,790 --> 00:50:08,610
Do you think your older brother is any different?

466
00:50:08,610 --> 00:50:10,930
You two aren't even full-blooded siblings.

467
00:50:12,100 --> 00:50:16,780
Since it's come to this, there is no other solution aside from marriage.

468
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:19,080
To protect you—

469
00:50:23,620 --> 00:50:25,140
Your Majesty...

470
00:50:26,570 --> 00:50:30,490
How about the Royal Chief Secretary Sin's daughter

471
00:50:30,490 --> 00:50:34,050
as the shield to protect him?

472
00:50:34,050 --> 00:50:35,880
Your Majesty, what I meant was—

473
00:50:35,880 --> 00:50:41,780
The Chief Royal Secretary is the queen's older brother and my most loyal subject.

474
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:44,250
Even if a sword was held to his throat, he wouldn't challenge me over the throne.

475
00:50:44,250 --> 00:50:46,190
There's no need for him to.

476
00:50:46,190 --> 00:50:49,510
Since he already has power surpassing that of Royal Father-in-Law.

477
00:50:49,510 --> 00:50:51,250
Your Majesty.

478
00:50:55,340 --> 00:51:00,210
Become the Royal Chief Secretary Sin Soo Geun's son-in-law. Enter their household.

479
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:03,030
Live quietly in  Geochang's countryside.

480
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,380
Don't ever have children either.

481
00:51:07,140 --> 00:51:13,020
Ensure that the sound of your breath does not make it past that household's walls.

482
00:51:15,300 --> 00:51:19,800
Then, I will spare your life.

483
00:51:22,750 --> 00:51:27,620
Why must I do that? I trust you, Hyungnim.

484
00:51:27,620 --> 00:51:31,900
I... do not trust you

485
00:51:32,530 --> 00:51:35,480
nor everything surrounding you.

486
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:46,860
If you want to prove your loyalty to me, die and be reborn

487
00:51:46,860 --> 00:51:50,320
as an ordinary peasant, not my younger brother.

488
00:51:51,160 --> 00:51:57,220
Yes, it'll be even better if you were reborn as a woman.

489
00:51:58,360 --> 00:52:00,790
Your Majesty! Your Maj—

490
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,570
Did you see?

491
00:52:09,540 --> 00:52:12,630
Those are his true colors.

492
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:16,410
Therefore, Yeok—

493
00:52:16,410 --> 00:52:21,930
Then, why am I still alive?

494
00:52:23,110 --> 00:52:26,280
I fell off my horse today.

495
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:34,260
Most people would have been severely injured, but I ended up with just a few scrapes on my knees

496
00:52:34,260 --> 00:52:36,580
thanks to having learned how to fall.

497
00:52:36,580 --> 00:52:40,560
The person who taught me how to fall is my brother.

498
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,580
That's when you two were both young!

499
00:52:41,580 --> 00:52:44,320
Exactly, Mother!

500
00:52:44,320 --> 00:52:50,480
If I were him, if I were the type of person you think he is,

501
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:54,730
I would have killed me earlier on. Before I had grown up this much,

502
00:52:54,730 --> 00:52:57,980
and before I could have learned how to fall.

503
00:52:57,980 --> 00:53:00,250
Because that's easier.

504
00:53:05,870 --> 00:53:10,560
I must leave this place immediately!  I feel as if I'll be suffocated to death.

505
00:53:12,950 --> 00:53:18,810
How is it that this spacious palace is filled only with those who suspect me?

506
00:53:22,540 --> 00:53:24,580
You have me.

507
00:53:24,580 --> 00:53:29,190
Soon it will be time for the royal guards to change shifts.

508
00:53:29,190 --> 00:53:35,330
If you leave the palace during this time, no one will be suspicious.

509
00:53:40,190 --> 00:53:45,300
You should visit the hot springs. It will make you feel much better.

510
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:48,280
Undress me.

511
00:54:02,560 --> 00:54:05,430
Stop! Stop him!

512
00:54:05,430 --> 00:54:08,030
It's the gangster-like young master!

513
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:20,980
We'll stand guard here.

514
00:54:48,700 --> 00:54:51,480
Your Highness! Your Highness, please wait a minute.

515
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:53,580
Your Highness!

516
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,560
I wish to meet my older brother.

517
00:54:55,560 --> 00:55:01,180
I want to resolve our misunderstandings. Hurry and announce me.

518
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:02,960
Now!

519
00:55:06,820 --> 00:55:10,530
Your Highness, His Majesty the King wishes to rest.

520
00:55:10,530 --> 00:55:13,010
Please return tomorrow—

521
00:55:13,010 --> 00:55:18,180
If that is the case, then I shall at least play the lute before I leave this place.

522
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,340
I'll deliver your wishes.

523
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:27,160
I'm sure His Majesty the King will be able to drift off to a deep slumber after hearing Your Highness' performance.

524
00:55:44,750 --> 00:55:47,890
  Brother, regardless of what anyone says, 

525
00:55:47,890 --> 00:55:53,790
  the fact that I'm alive like this is evidence that you love me. 

526
00:55:58,280 --> 00:56:03,370
Trying to change his mind with a mere lute performance?

527
00:56:05,220 --> 00:56:10,070
How should I respond to his inferior idea of romance?

528
00:56:29,030 --> 00:56:31,450
Where is this place?

529
00:56:42,050 --> 00:56:45,030
I'm sure he came this way.

530
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:14,400
Where did your owner go?

531
00:57:14,400 --> 00:57:18,270
Young Master! Young Master!

532
00:57:26,110 --> 00:57:28,180
Young Master!

533
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:39,430


534
00:57:55,700 --> 00:57:59,080
♫  You don't have to speak  ♫

535
00:57:59,080 --> 00:58:01,350
Who are you?

536
00:58:01,350 --> 00:58:04,820
♫  You were here when I opened my eyes  ♫

537
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:08,660
Could I know the meaning of that gaze? 
 ♫  The sight of you  ♫

538
00:58:08,660 --> 00:58:14,770
♫  smiling so brightly is blinding  ♫

539
00:58:18,060 --> 00:58:22,830
♫  Because you came a step closer  ♫

540
00:58:23,660 --> 00:58:28,280
♫  My heart is pounding  ♫

541
00:58:29,190 --> 00:58:36,990
♫  You, who shine so brightly, who are you?   ♫ 
♫  My breath stops  ♫
