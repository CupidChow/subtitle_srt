1
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:44,840
Stop. 
  Episode 15 

2
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:52,750
What if I can't allow it?

3
00:00:52,750 --> 00:00:55,130
Then kill me.

4
00:00:55,130 --> 00:00:57,900
Even if you kill me,

5
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:03,270
you won't be able to get what you want.

6
00:01:05,160 --> 00:01:08,250
Because even as a ghost,

7
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,310
I will be together with Chae Gyeong.

8
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:24,900


9
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:51,580
Are you alright?

10
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,960
Yes.

11
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:59,350
Don't do anything risky again.

12
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:04,470
No, I won't.

13
00:02:10,150 --> 00:02:13,360
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty.

14
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:10,770
I don't know how you could bring yourself here.

15
00:03:10,770 --> 00:03:14,840
Is His Majesty alright?

16
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:19,470
He gave an order prohibiting anyone from entering. Why don't you come back next time?

17
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,970
Do you know

18
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,540
what you did just now?

19
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,080
Yes.

20
00:03:52,130 --> 00:03:57,420
I gave up... the throne.

21
00:03:57,420 --> 00:04:01,370
Do you think you gave up only the throne?

22
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:05,590
You also gave up your life. You gave up on living.

23
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:08,150
Like my older brother,

24
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,880
in order to become king, I doubted,

25
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,720
threatened, and tried to kill my family.

26
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,710
When did you do that?

27
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:20,860
Since you, the Deputy Commander, and Myeong Hye

28
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,230
are the same as Lee Yeok.

29
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:28,340
Royal Mother, Deputy Commander, and all our comrades are king.

30
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:32,480
Their actions, dreams, and the world they aim for

31
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:37,220
are passed down through my eyes, lips, and goals

32
00:04:37,220 --> 00:04:40,330
in the end.

33
00:04:40,330 --> 00:04:45,740
But I was becoming like Hyungnim.

34
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:48,980
And in the most despicable form at that.

35
00:04:48,980 --> 00:04:52,090
I am not any different from Hyungnim,

36
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:55,700
so why do I need to drive him out to become king?

37
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:00,440
Thus, I was unable to find a reason for me to become a king.

38
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,390
I will be content in this life with

39
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:08,400
just protecting those I wish to protect.

40
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:17,030
Did you forget that your life isn't yours alone?

41
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:19,270
Because you gave birth to me,

42
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,510
because you saved me,

43
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:27,910
don't try to control my life in the future.

44
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:48,810
Yeok! Yeok!

45
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:03,950
Do you want to go anywhere?

46
00:06:03,950 --> 00:06:05,490
Pardon?

47
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:08,320
I don't want to go back to that house.

48
00:06:14,810 --> 00:06:20,300
  Our lives finally became easy and simple  

49
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:24,040
  with neither doubts nor secrets  

50
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,030
  since  now we only have to fear death. 

51
00:06:27,030 --> 00:06:31,200
  However, death comes to everyone.  

52
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:37,360
  We cast spells on each other that we should only be happy until then. 

53
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,440
Where are you going?

54
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:44,340
Follow me.

55
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:50,110
This place is—

56
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:53,440
Since we can't go back to our childhood,

57
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,060
how about untangling the knot of misunderstandings and retying it

58
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:03,010
at the first place we met as adults?

59
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:10,490
However, it's not such a pleasant memory for you.

60
00:07:10,490 --> 00:07:15,380
Because I held a memorial service for a person who's alive and well like this.

61
00:07:16,230 --> 00:07:18,930
What hurt me more than the memorial service was

62
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:24,830
that you were with my older brother of all people.

63
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:28,670
I didn't know about the misunderstanding and

64
00:07:28,670 --> 00:07:30,780
the suffering between you two.

65
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:37,150
I know. Because I knew, I was able to not hate you.

66
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:41,450
Because I knew, I was able to love you.

67
00:07:41,450 --> 00:07:43,360
Yes.

68
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,630
What did you say just now?

69
00:07:48,630 --> 00:07:49,970
What?

70
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:56,030
Just now, you said because you knew you were able to do something.

71
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:57,210
Pardon?

72
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:01,930
Because you knew, lov—

73
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:05,600
Well, I don't know.

74
00:08:05,600 --> 00:08:09,800
I don't know what you're talking about.

75
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:13,020
Gosh!

76
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:19,030
  You were a step too late. 

77
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:26,430
  Yeok gave the secret order to his older brother and announced that he's giving up the throne. 

78
00:08:28,450 --> 00:08:32,310
It took so much effort to find that secret order and he gave that to the king?

79
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:37,920
Did you know about this?

80
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:42,360
No. However, from the beginning, it was a mistake

81
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:45,440
that you put Young Lady Chae Gyeong in danger.

82
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,780
Hyungnim was determined to become king to protect Young Lady Chae Gyeong.

83
00:08:48,780 --> 00:08:51,480
He decided to become king for a mere girl?

84
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:56,140
It's possible if that woman is his reason for living.

85
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,380
I can never let it end like this.

86
00:08:58,380 --> 00:09:04,310
If you take a wrong step forward, it will only lead to the opposite effect.

87
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,010
Does that mean it's over now?

88
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:14,930
Since the secret order has been ripped up, does that mean it's over as long as the Grand Prince and Chae Gyeong move to the countryside?

89
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:19,840
I am not sure if the king will allow them to move to the countryside.

90
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:22,210
Why not?

91
00:09:22,210 --> 00:09:27,030
All things considered, the king has our Chae Gyeong

92
00:09:27,980 --> 00:09:30,900
in his heart as a woman.

93
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,400
However, it was the king who ordered those two to marry.

94
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:45,820
In a way unknown to us, the king must be fighting with himself.

95
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:51,170
The late king's will mixed with his love towards Chae Gyeong,

96
00:09:51,170 --> 00:09:56,440
putting life and death, destiny, and even the fate of the nation on the line.

97
00:09:58,910 --> 00:10:02,300
Then, as quickly as possible,

98
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:06,800
let's have the Grand Prince and Chae Gyeong move to the countryside. My Lord!

99
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:16,390
The innkeeper here is very nice.

100
00:10:16,390 --> 00:10:20,420
Last time, she lent the entire tavern and today, she even lent me clothes.

101
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:23,440
That's because you pay her.

102
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,440
Hurry and get changed.

103
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,510
I really won't look.

104
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:42,460
I don't believe you. Stay that way.

105
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,940
Were you deceived your whole life?

106
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:51,290
I am not looking. Really.

107
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:53,730
Don't look sideways.

108
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,130
How is it? I like it and it's comfortable.

109
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:23,310
Whatever you wear, you look beautiful. Beautiful.

110
00:11:28,100 --> 00:11:31,890
 I am not any different from Hyungnim, 

111
00:11:31,890 --> 00:11:35,770
 so why do I need to drive him out to become king? 

112
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:40,320
Your Majesty! Your Highness, Queen Dowager!

113
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,390
What—

114
00:11:44,530 --> 00:11:45,630
Your Majesty.

115
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,800
Royal Mother.

116
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:02,080
You too were

117
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:05,630
stabbed in the back by Yeok today.

118
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:10,860
You must have been earnestly looking for the secret order.

119
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,460
What should be done?

120
00:12:13,460 --> 00:12:18,600
Yeok did something immense today.

121
00:12:18,600 --> 00:12:23,850
He hasn't changed a bit from before.

122
00:12:23,850 --> 00:12:26,390
Don't you agree?

123
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,740
You drank too much. Your body—

124
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:33,700
Please call Yeok here, Royal Mother.

125
00:12:35,410 --> 00:12:40,000
Should I give it to Yeok now?

126
00:12:41,650 --> 00:12:45,240
The throne, I mean.

127
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:49,060
Tell Yeok to become king.

128
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:54,020
Then, instead, I will become Chae Gyeong's husband

129
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:56,790
and the First Vice Premier's son-in-law.

130
00:12:56,790 --> 00:13:04,670
Your son and I will live that way.

131
00:13:06,490 --> 00:13:10,420
It's too late to do so.

132
00:13:20,310 --> 00:13:26,890
To do so, you have to be reborn, Your Majesty.

133
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:30,930
In your next life, be born as my daughter.

134
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:37,740
Then, I will braid your hair, make your clothes,

135
00:13:39,270 --> 00:13:42,330
and give you lots of love.

136
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,510
Court Lady Choi!

137
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,810
Yes, Your Highness.

138
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,390
Send a message to the Queen.

139
00:14:12,130 --> 00:14:14,530
I will stay by his side.

140
00:14:14,530 --> 00:14:16,770
Please prepare honey water, Eunuch Kim.

141
00:14:16,770 --> 00:14:19,000
Yes, Your Highness.

142
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:06,620
I had forgotten about this.

143
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,400
What is that?

144
00:15:29,420 --> 00:15:30,870
It's nothing.

145
00:15:30,870 --> 00:15:36,240
I don't think it's nothing. Are you trying to hide things again?

146
00:15:44,190 --> 00:15:48,630
I had it with me because I wanted to give it to you.

147
00:15:48,630 --> 00:15:50,960
Is it a present?

148
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:55,730
When did you have time to think about preparing something like this?

149
00:15:55,730 --> 00:16:00,090
I meant to give it to you but it's been a while since I carried it with me.

150
00:16:00,090 --> 00:16:04,970
I don't think this gift is appropriate for this situation. No, I mean,

151
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:08,170
to call it a gift, it's a bit—

152
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:14,960
However, this gift is not easy to guess.

153
00:16:14,960 --> 00:16:18,650
I made you really upset.

154
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:22,130
If something upsets or angers you,

155
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:26,090
instead of keeping it to yourself, throw it as much as you'd like.

156
00:16:26,090 --> 00:16:28,040
Throw it?

157
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:39,380
  You embrace me and talk about whether your heart is pounding or not while flirting with any man! 

158
00:16:39,380 --> 00:16:41,060
 - Go. 
 - Ouch.  

159
00:16:41,060 --> 00:16:42,110
  - Leave! 
 - What?  

160
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:44,170
  I said leave!  

161
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:48,680
It hurts a bit, rather a lot...

162
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,630
It does hurt a bit,

163
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,200
but if it helps you get over your anger, why not?

164
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,930
You call this a gift?

165
00:16:58,020 --> 00:17:00,430
What is this? Are you scared?

166
00:17:00,430 --> 00:17:03,320
- No. 
 - This time, it's for real.

167
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,570
It seems like

168
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,660
you're not ready yet.

169
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:22,430
I think

170
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:26,620
you were very hurt last time.

171
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:31,380
So are you going to avoid it like this, like a coward?

172
00:17:32,310 --> 00:17:36,500
I have really been a coward, haven't I?

173
00:17:38,470 --> 00:17:41,290
And it was really hard for you.

174
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:50,870
If you don't do anything after this, you really are a coward. 
  ♫   Suddenly the whole world is filled by you  ♫

175
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:53,650
Do something.
 ♫   Suddenly you were there without a sound  ♫

176
00:17:53,650 --> 00:17:59,170
♫   Suddenly you were there without a sound  ♫

177
00:17:59,170 --> 00:18:04,100
♫    The first moment I saw you,  I was so nervous
I couldn't bring myself to look at your eyes   ♫

178
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:06,970
Then, continue being a coward.

179
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:14,970
♫  What do I do now when my breath is about to stop?    ♫

180
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:26,100
♫   I want to hold you, the one whose brilliance chillls my heart   ♫

181
00:18:26,130 --> 00:18:28,610
♫   I'm afraid you  might fly away when the wind blows   ♫

182
00:18:28,610 --> 00:18:33,940
  Do you love me?  

183
00:18:33,940 --> 00:18:38,640
  How can I not?   
♫   Because your smile and tears fill my heart,   ♫

184
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,850
  I love you. I yearn for you.  

185
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:50,310
  I love you. Very. Very much so.  
  ♫    I will always remember only you   ♫

186
00:18:51,870 --> 00:18:54,870
  You can just do one thing.  

187
00:18:58,850 --> 00:19:02,920
 Lee Yoong will abdicate the throne to Grand Prince Jin Seong 

188
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:05,870
 and assist his younger brother as a retired king. 

189
00:19:05,870 --> 00:19:07,970
 He is the son of a deposed queen! 

190
00:19:07,970 --> 00:19:11,570
 Name Grand Prince Jin Seong as the crown prince! 

191
00:19:11,570 --> 00:19:16,540
 - Assist his younger brother as a retired king. 
 - Abdicate the throne. 

192
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,020
Head Eunuch. Head Eunuch!

193
00:19:26,020 --> 00:19:28,640
Yes, Your Majesty.

194
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:33,490
Bring me liquor. Liquor!

195
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:51,300
Head Eunuch!

196
00:19:58,130 --> 00:19:59,780
Who are you?

197
00:19:59,780 --> 00:20:02,400
 You bastard! 

198
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:09,040
 You dare to refuse your father's order 

199
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:14,730
 and you insist on keeping the throne? 

200
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:24,570
Leave. Leave! Disappear!

201
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:27,710
 Didn't I tell you that if you rule over Joseon, 

202
00:20:27,710 --> 00:20:30,620
 Joseon will be ruined? 

203
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:33,620
You are!

204
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:44,370
 The people of Joseon will starve from 

205
00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:48,760
 your tyranny, capriciousness, and dogmatism. 

206
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:55,450
Royal Father, you just cherish Yeok more.

207
00:20:55,450 --> 00:21:02,250
I am just not to your liking!

208
00:21:02,910 --> 00:21:09,100
Please go away now! Disappear!

209
00:21:19,610 --> 00:21:25,480
- Your Majesty! 
 - Your Majesty!

210
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:32,220
Your Majesty!

211
00:21:49,170 --> 00:21:51,460
I don't want to say goodbye.

212
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,200
We will continue to be together in the future.

213
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:56,190
I'm not talking about you.

214
00:21:56,190 --> 00:21:58,620
I'm talking about my friends.

215
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:02,150
Gwang Woo, Seok Hee, and Seon Ho.

216
00:22:02,150 --> 00:22:05,560
We can all go down to the countryside and live together then.

217
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:10,760
Anyway, if you're not around, won't the Snail Brides also disband?

218
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:13,750
I'm not sure.

219
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:15,990
I guess so.

220
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:20,740
You'll be back soon, right?

221
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:22,590
Of course.

222
00:22:23,350 --> 00:22:25,830
Then I'll see you when you come back.

223
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:28,270
You have to let go of my hand.

224
00:22:29,150 --> 00:22:32,920
Oh my, I thought it was my hand.

225
00:22:35,510 --> 00:22:37,460
I'm really going now.

226
00:22:38,120 --> 00:22:39,760
You should go inside.

227
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,440
♫   Love calls  ♫

228
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:43,250
Go back in.

229
00:22:43,250 --> 00:22:47,520
♫  So we ride the clouds  ♫

230
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,760
You've come, Lady of the House.

231
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:18,050
All of you are still here even after knowing what happened to me last night?

232
00:23:19,230 --> 00:23:22,940
Get out of this house immediately! I can't trust you.

233
00:23:22,940 --> 00:23:27,200
However, Lady of the House, we did that because of the royal command—

234
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:32,760
So are you saying that I was kidnapped by that royal command during the night?!

235
00:23:34,550 --> 00:23:39,250
If not, then should I report what happened last night to the king

236
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:43,640
to hold you accountable for not being able to protect me properly?!

237
00:23:44,380 --> 00:23:49,160
If it is the former, then the royal council and the royal family will be in an uproar and you will be harmed.

238
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:54,590
If it is the latter, then a few of you will

239
00:23:54,590 --> 00:23:57,730
probably lose your heads.

240
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:02,600
How about just leaving quietly when I give you the opportunity?

241
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,420
We will do as we are told.

242
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,200
Nanny.

243
00:24:39,540 --> 00:24:41,760
My lady!

244
00:24:45,430 --> 00:24:47,520
Are you alright?

245
00:25:06,090 --> 00:25:08,780
You were worried sick, weren't you?

246
00:25:08,780 --> 00:25:11,530
Of course, I was.

247
00:25:12,140 --> 00:25:17,400
I told you I wouldn't cause any trouble but I always make you cry.

248
00:25:18,360 --> 00:25:21,620
My Lady, can we just

249
00:25:21,620 --> 00:25:24,540
live in Geochang like we used to?

250
00:25:24,540 --> 00:25:28,790
I won't say anything about you snooping around other people's stables.

251
00:25:28,790 --> 00:25:31,070
Please, let's leave Hanyang.

252
00:25:31,590 --> 00:25:37,500
I'm so scared that something will happen to you. I can no longer stay here.

253
00:25:40,150 --> 00:25:42,080
We'll be leaving soon.

254
00:25:42,760 --> 00:25:47,270
Once the Grand Prince comes back after wrapping up his business, let's leave.

255
00:25:47,890 --> 00:25:52,290
The king will give us permission to leave the capital soon.

256
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,230
Do you mean that?

257
00:25:58,950 --> 00:26:02,720
And that little fox of a girl...

258
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:05,360
I don't know what happened but—

259
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,860
Lady of the House, you've arrived?

260
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,960
Let me greet you again. My name is Yoon Myeong Hye.

261
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:35,060
You are Deputy Commander Park Won Jong's maternal niece, right?

262
00:26:35,720 --> 00:26:38,580
Since when did you know this?

263
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:42,630
Ever since you first came to this house.

264
00:26:44,510 --> 00:26:47,270
Yet, you let me into the house anyway?

265
00:26:48,230 --> 00:26:51,050
Why do you have to live your life so difficultly?

266
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:58,720
I wonder if it was right to go so far as to disguise yourself and hide your identity?

267
00:26:59,970 --> 00:27:04,890
I don't think I am in a position to be lectured by you.

268
00:27:04,890 --> 00:27:10,030
You said life is about living either in a cruel or a vulgar way, right?

269
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:15,230
And you said that you chose to live a cruel life because you didn't want to live a vulgar one.

270
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:22,430
But... what you did this time was very vulgar.

271
00:27:23,350 --> 00:27:26,660
To the point where it's a waste for me to hate or get angry with you.

272
00:27:29,450 --> 00:27:31,570
Goodbye.

273
00:27:32,480 --> 00:27:37,790
What if that is on behalf of Orabeoni?

274
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:45,300
My lady, I'm wondering how far you'll go for Orabeoni.

275
00:27:47,610 --> 00:27:50,950
Would you be able to even abandon yourself?

276
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:56,220
At the very least, I

277
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:59,370
seem to be more earnest than you are, my lady.

278
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:18,100
I didn't know the secret order of the late King was with Chae Gyeong out of all people.

279
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:21,890
Even I had no idea.

280
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,620
Is that so?

281
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:28,290
In any case, the Grand Prince has taken care of the matter

282
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:32,080
so shouldn't we wrap up this issue well?

283
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:35,490
Things are pretty unsettled in and out of the palace.

284
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,490
But what can we do?

285
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:42,630
I don't think the King will let our kids leave the capital so easily.

286
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:46,850
How can we talk about them leaving the capital? It's a relief he didn't kill them.

287
00:28:46,850 --> 00:28:48,800
What do you mean?

288
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:54,310
In any case, the King probably feels a huge sense of betrayal by you, First Vice Premier.

289
00:28:54,310 --> 00:28:56,880
Especially with Chae Gyeong.

290
00:28:56,880 --> 00:29:02,190
Now that she is my daughter-in-law, this is really embarrassing to say,

291
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:07,440
but it seems like the King is so fond of her.

292
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:13,060
Were you aware of it?

293
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:22,330
I have no idea what you're saying, Your Highness.

294
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:27,750
In any case, request them to behave properly.

295
00:30:11,750 --> 00:30:16,020
I should've killed you then.

296
00:30:23,370 --> 00:30:25,800
No, I mean

297
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,900
it's still not too late.

298
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:31,760
It's not late! That's right!

299
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:42,560
I'm back.

300
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:10,140
How could you do this?! Are we really nothing to you?

301
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:13,130
Sorry.

302
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:16,630
Let's say that you wanted to give up everything.

303
00:31:16,630 --> 00:31:18,860
But at least!

304
00:31:19,630 --> 00:31:22,720
You should've discussed this with us first, don't you think so?!

305
00:31:22,720 --> 00:31:28,530
What about the others? What about the others who sacrificed their lives working to make you king?

306
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,970
I have done wrong.

307
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:48,490
Get up!

308
00:31:48,490 --> 00:31:52,900
For not keeping the promise to become king for you guys,

309
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:55,860
for running away like this irresponsibly,

310
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:01,570
I am really sorry.

311
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,830
But what I am more sorry about is that

312
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,580
even after committing such an immense act like that,

313
00:32:13,970 --> 00:32:15,970
I am happy.

314
00:32:18,010 --> 00:32:19,750
For the first time.

315
00:32:25,790 --> 00:32:29,690
After throwing away that secret order that caused a division between Hyungnim and me,

316
00:32:30,370 --> 00:32:32,700
I feel liberated.

317
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:37,420
Also after coming clean to Chae Gyeong about everything,

318
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:41,900
I finally feel alive.

319
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:43,100
I said get up.

320
00:32:43,100 --> 00:32:45,610
I finally realized that

321
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:49,120
I wanted to take the throne,

322
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:51,580
not because of any great cause or belief

323
00:32:52,510 --> 00:32:55,460
but in order to exact revenge against my older brother.

324
00:32:55,460 --> 00:33:01,040
However, a king shouldn't become like that.

325
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:02,500
Isn't it right?

326
00:33:04,450 --> 00:33:07,080
And more than anything,

327
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:13,100
I want to believe in Hyungnim once more.

328
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:31,660
I understand how you feel.

329
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,150
However, I can't follow your decision.

330
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:42,630
To you, the king is your blood brother before he is the king.

331
00:33:42,630 --> 00:33:45,530
So I understand your heart will soften towards him.

332
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:51,220
However, to me, to us,

333
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:54,460
the king is only a murderer who killed our families and

334
00:33:54,460 --> 00:33:58,340
an incompetent ruler who persecutes the people.

335
00:33:59,560 --> 00:34:04,220
Thus, I will continue to carry out the Snail Brides' work.

336
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,440
Even though we can't change the king,

337
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:12,940
there must be a force who can keep the king in check.

338
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,050
You should leave.

339
00:34:18,050 --> 00:34:20,450
Even if you were to stay here,

340
00:34:21,710 --> 00:34:24,100
it will only put us in greater danger.

341
00:34:43,620 --> 00:34:46,070
Alright, do you have something urgent to report?

342
00:34:46,070 --> 00:34:48,220
The secret room in the pawn shop.

343
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,560
First Vice Premier Sin Soo Geun knows about it.

344
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,100
What?

345
00:34:53,390 --> 00:34:54,910
What are you talking about?

346
00:34:54,910 --> 00:34:58,510
The First Vice Premier secretly investigated the Snail Brides and

347
00:34:58,510 --> 00:35:01,910
disguised himself as a member of the Snail Brides and sneaked into our secret room.

348
00:35:01,910 --> 00:35:03,040
Then.

349
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,150
The Grand Prince let him go.

350
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:08,950
Then, the First Vice Premier is already aware of everything,

351
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:11,820
and yet he still hasn't made any moves.

352
00:35:11,820 --> 00:35:16,620
It's because if he reveals that Grand Prince Jin Seong is the leader of the Snail Brides and is plotting treason,

353
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:19,150
even his daughter might be put in danger.

354
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:21,390
However, think about where he's coming from.

355
00:35:21,390 --> 00:35:23,690
In the end, he is the king's closest kin

356
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:27,590
and his mission is to assist the king and protect the royal authority.

357
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:33,580
He won't keep the secret about the pawn shop forever based on his love for his daughter.

358
00:35:33,580 --> 00:35:38,060
Then, how about we follow the Queen Dowager's request?

359
00:35:38,060 --> 00:35:40,360
Did she give you special instructions?

360
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:46,210
She said to prevent Orabeoni from moving to the countryside by using his weakness.

361
00:35:46,210 --> 00:35:48,710
His weakness.

362
00:35:48,710 --> 00:35:55,050
  Until now, Yeok dreamt of a rebellion from feelings of  betrayal he underwent when his older brother tried to harm him.  

363
00:35:55,050 --> 00:36:01,360
  That led to a compulsion not only about his life but also about the life of those precious to him 

364
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:04,560
  and that compulsive belief is his weakness. 

365
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:10,310
  I guess that's why each time, unexpected events such as these take place. 

366
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:15,840
  Whenever someone is in danger or gets hurt, the Grand Prince loses his rationality. 

367
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:22,020
  Thus, it won't be hard to deal with him from now. 

368
00:36:22,020 --> 00:36:24,650
  We need to make him realize the only way to protect his people 

369
00:36:25,500 --> 00:36:28,930
  is by becoming a king. 

370
00:36:29,460 --> 00:36:33,420
How about we drive a wedge between the King and the First Vice Premier?

371
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:37,960
If the King finds out that the First Vice Premier didn't report the hideout of the Snail Brides after finding out about it,

372
00:36:37,960 --> 00:36:40,720
the King will feel greatly betrayed by the First Vice Premier.

373
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:46,570
Then, based on his temperament, the King will cause great injury to the First Vice Premier.

374
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:47,730
Fine.

375
00:36:47,730 --> 00:36:53,420
Then the Grand Prince will do something for the First Vice Premier's family.

376
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:57,690
He would not be able to even think about moving to the countryside.

377
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:11,480
I guess you must have a lot of free time on your hand since you're on probation, Deputy Commander.

378
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,320
You even requested to see this old man.

379
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,390
I am here to comfort you since it seems

380
00:37:18,390 --> 00:37:20,660
like you were greatly shocked by recent events.

381
00:37:20,660 --> 00:37:22,660
I have a present for you too.

382
00:37:22,660 --> 00:37:25,280
A present?

383
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:30,880
You must be well aware that I am picky when it comes to gifts.

384
00:37:31,640 --> 00:37:34,590
It will be to your liking.

385
00:37:34,590 --> 00:37:40,230
Your relationship with the First Vice Premier has been distant lately.

386
00:37:40,230 --> 00:37:42,460
First Vice Premier?

387
00:37:44,460 --> 00:37:50,060
Are you perhaps here to tell me the First Vice Premier's weakness?

388
00:37:50,830 --> 00:37:53,320
To be honest...

389
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:56,890
The First Vice Premier did?

390
00:37:56,890 --> 00:37:59,170
That is so, Your Majesty.

391
00:37:59,170 --> 00:38:04,290
If this is true, the First Vice Premier sided with the traitors.

392
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:08,850
You cannot have him by your side.

393
00:38:10,610 --> 00:38:14,590
Goodness! Please spare me.

394
00:38:14,590 --> 00:38:18,900
Please spare me. Please spare me.

395
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:29,050
How dare you talk back about my decision to demolish civilians' houses.

396
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:35,320
What are you all doing?

397
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:39,600
You should be waving the flag and shouting bullseye.

398
00:38:39,610 --> 00:38:41,280
It's a bullseye.

399
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:46,170
Your Majesty! Please stop the meaningless killings.

400
00:38:46,170 --> 00:38:48,250
What do you mean meaningless?

401
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:53,430
I am solidifying my royal authority now.

402
00:38:56,200 --> 00:38:59,040
Since you never know when those who disobey my commands

403
00:38:59,040 --> 00:39:02,760
might go after my throne.

404
00:39:05,570 --> 00:39:10,560
What kind of power or traitorous mind would they have to seek your throne?

405
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:17,100
Right, they don't have power or traitorous minds.

406
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,800
However,

407
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:25,380
you have them.

408
00:39:25,380 --> 00:39:30,270
You have power and a traitorous mind.

409
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:35,720
Your Majesty, I am a subject to you alone.

410
00:39:35,720 --> 00:39:38,760
Then why didn't you present the secret order to me?

411
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,590
I didn't know about it.

412
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:44,590
If I knew, I would have presented it long ago.

413
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:53,930
Prove it. That you don't have a traitorous mind.

414
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:58,540
Catch the Snail Brides.

415
00:39:58,540 --> 00:40:03,570
After catching them, expose that Grand Prince Jin Seong is their leader.

416
00:40:03,570 --> 00:40:08,430
The secret order has been burnt already, and Grand Prince Jin Seong has decided to move to the countryside.

417
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:11,780
Even if Grand Prince Jin Seong is their leader,

418
00:40:11,780 --> 00:40:15,290
they are now an organization without power or cause.

419
00:40:15,290 --> 00:40:18,990
Right. They don't have power or cause.

420
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:22,180
That's why I must catch them even more.

421
00:40:22,180 --> 00:40:24,850
I must catch them and kill them.

422
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:29,600
Your Majesty, please let Grand Prince Jin Seong go.

423
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:32,730
When did I ask you to catch Grand Prince Jin Seong?

424
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,880
I am telling you to catch the Snail Brides, the Snail Brides!

425
00:40:51,220 --> 00:40:53,270
Goodness, what is that?

426
00:40:53,270 --> 00:40:56,510
You're helping by sitting still.

427
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,120
What is that? I haven't seen it before.

428
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:12,680
Did you receive it as a gift?

429
00:41:13,490 --> 00:41:18,030
A surprise gift. But he said he had it prepared for a long time.

430
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:21,010
Oh my, you don't miss out.

431
00:41:37,780 --> 00:41:43,030
♫   Leave comfortably  ♫

432
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:48,030
♫  You are waking up from a harsh dream  ♫

433
00:41:48,790 --> 00:41:53,830
♫  As time passes as you count the seasons  ♫

434
00:41:53,830 --> 00:41:59,030
♫  Will you forget even the painful memories?  ♫

435
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:04,490
The real present was here.

436
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,380
No. Even the bridal headpiece was removed by Nanny.

437
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:11,570
He should put the ring on my finger.

438
00:42:11,570 --> 00:42:15,580
♫  Just know that you're drenched with the sunset  ♫

439
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:20,590
♫  It's okay, leave comfortably  ♫

440
00:42:22,110 --> 00:42:26,130
What are you doing instead of sleeping?

441
00:42:27,010 --> 00:42:31,550
You have to put this on my finger.

442
00:42:31,550 --> 00:42:32,480
How did you find—?

443
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:37,150
Yes, I found this on my own, so hurry up and put it on my finger.

444
00:42:37,150 --> 00:42:41,890
♫  I alone will remember  ♫

445
00:42:41,890 --> 00:42:47,170
♫  My dear, my dear you will   ♫

446
00:42:47,170 --> 00:42:52,560
♫  light up my love in the night sky every day  ♫

447
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,470
♫  Yearning and yearning  ♫

448
00:42:55,470 --> 00:42:58,050
It fits perfectly.

449
00:42:58,050 --> 00:43:02,210
It's pretty.

450
00:43:02,210 --> 00:43:04,500
♫  Please remember me  ♫

451
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:07,110
Let me try it on once.

452
00:43:07,110 --> 00:43:08,190
Why?

453
00:43:08,190 --> 00:43:10,260
- Let me see it just once.
- No.

454
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:12,420
Am I going to steal it? Goodness.

455
00:43:12,420 --> 00:43:14,320
Why are you being like this? Just once!

456
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,240
- But still, why? 
 - Just once, just once.

457
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:19,000
Is the Lady of the House present?

458
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:28,610
My lady, someone from the palace is here.

459
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:32,000
Don't you think it's to grant you permission to leave for the countryside?

460
00:43:46,970 --> 00:43:49,100
I'm alright.

461
00:43:49,100 --> 00:43:51,250
I'm also alright.

462
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:26,000
By the way, the Queen Dowager and the Deputy Commander's side isn't going to easily give up on the rebellion.

463
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:30,480
- Have you arrived? 
 - Have you arrived?

464
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:34,480
Orabeoni, you were here.

465
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:41,440
Her Highness the Queen Dowager asked me to escort you to her.

466
00:44:41,440 --> 00:44:44,200
An announcement for you to leave the capital will be released today.

467
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:48,380
Before you leave, she wanted to see your face.

468
00:44:49,110 --> 00:44:50,800
An announcement?

469
00:44:51,680 --> 00:44:53,270
Yes.

470
00:44:54,270 --> 00:44:57,060
Permission was granted sooner than we thought.

471
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:00,850
I'll be going to the palace.

472
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:03,650
Let's meet later at the tavern by the three way intersection.

473
00:45:03,650 --> 00:45:05,930
It might be our last.

474
00:45:05,930 --> 00:45:08,100
We should all have a drink.

475
00:45:33,560 --> 00:45:37,380
During this time, they've been giving out rice to the poor,

476
00:45:37,380 --> 00:45:40,790
exposing corruption by pasting bulletins,

477
00:45:40,790 --> 00:45:44,260
and causing a stir among the people. This group of people are called the Snail Brides.

478
00:45:44,260 --> 00:45:47,800
In reality, a tip has come in saying that they are seeking to incite a rebellion.

479
00:45:47,800 --> 00:45:52,990
Thus, by launching a surprise attack in their hideout, I intend to round up their leaders.

480
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:56,230
Starting now, please act according to my order.

481
00:45:56,230 --> 00:45:59,890
The First Vice Premier led the Royal Investigative Bureau guards?

482
00:45:59,890 --> 00:46:01,780
Yes.

483
00:46:01,780 --> 00:46:05,830
What about Yeok? He wouldn't be at the pawn shop, right?

484
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,860
Lady Myeong Hye said she went to find him.

485
00:46:09,650 --> 00:46:14,180
Myeong Hye must get Yeok out of there safely.

486
00:46:24,580 --> 00:46:30,090
 In order to set the table of that magnitude, we have to offer them something in return. 

487
00:46:30,090 --> 00:46:32,790
 There is something we have to gain in the process too. 

488
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:37,620
 I think it would be a good idea to cut the tail and wrap up the Snail Brides' activity. 

489
00:46:37,620 --> 00:46:40,640
 Since the King and the Chief Royal Secretary are bent on catching the Snail Brides, 

490
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:44,440
 we should offer them a tail piece and break away from their chase. 

491
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:48,200
 How much of the tail are you thinking of cutting? 

492
00:46:48,200 --> 00:46:50,900
 Wouldn't Seo No be appropriate? 

493
00:46:50,900 --> 00:46:54,600
 His father is dead and we've also gotten enough use out of him. 

494
00:47:03,640 --> 00:47:05,630
 Royal Decree 

495
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:13,140
Your Majesty, the Lady is here.

496
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,890
Tell her to enter.

497
00:47:28,650 --> 00:47:31,660
I greet you, Your Majesty.

498
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:33,690
You've come?

499
00:47:33,690 --> 00:47:35,960
Yes, Your Majesty.

500
00:47:35,960 --> 00:47:39,160
Do you know why I called for you?

501
00:47:40,070 --> 00:47:42,380
No, I don't.

502
00:47:42,380 --> 00:47:45,170
You made a wish, didn't you?

503
00:47:45,170 --> 00:47:48,610
Your husband also reaffirmed it.

504
00:47:48,610 --> 00:47:51,450
By even showing me the secret order.

505
00:47:54,990 --> 00:47:58,930
So what can I do? I have to grant it.

506
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:03,920
Since it's a king's promise.

507
00:48:07,620 --> 00:48:10,140
 Royal decree granting permission for Grand Prince Jin Seong and House Lady of Clan Sin to retire to the countryside.  

508
00:48:19,420 --> 00:48:21,890
 Signed on Hongzhi (Ming Dynasty) 17th year (1504) 

509
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:49,070
Your grace is immeasurable.

510
00:48:53,320 --> 00:48:56,200
I have kept my promise.

511
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:59,800
However, since you haven't kept your promise,

512
00:48:59,800 --> 00:49:03,330
you will end up paying the price.

513
00:49:03,330 --> 00:49:05,700
What do you mean by price?

514
00:49:05,700 --> 00:49:13,330
The First Vice Premier found the Snail Brides' hideout but didn't report it to me.

515
00:49:14,400 --> 00:49:18,380
Thus, in order to confirm his loyalty,

516
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:23,490
I gave a royal command to clear away the Snail Brides.

517
00:49:32,930 --> 00:49:34,160
Is everyone here?

518
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:35,370
Yes, sir.

519
00:49:35,370 --> 00:49:38,090
Search everywhere!

520
00:49:38,090 --> 00:49:39,850
Yes, sir.

521
00:49:47,450 --> 00:49:50,040
- Get everything without leaving a single page behind.
- I did so.

522
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:52,630
Let's hurry.

523
00:49:53,790 --> 00:49:55,890
Start from the back.

524
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:10,390
First Vice Premier, you're working hard.

525
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:15,230
So have you found their hideout?

526
00:50:15,230 --> 00:50:19,140
If I did, I would've already cleared them out.

527
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:22,170
What to do now.

528
00:50:22,170 --> 00:50:27,590
If His Majesty heard, he would be very disappointed.

529
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,710
From what I heard,

530
00:50:30,710 --> 00:50:37,720
you were even at the Snail Brides' hideout.

531
00:50:38,880 --> 00:50:42,730
Where did you hear that?

532
00:50:43,720 --> 00:50:46,910
Someone gave me a gift.

533
00:50:47,840 --> 00:50:51,470
There is nowhere else to go.

534
00:50:51,470 --> 00:50:54,800
Will it be your son-in-law or your daughter?

535
00:50:57,120 --> 00:51:00,710
Choose just one.

536
00:51:00,710 --> 00:51:05,220
If you catch Grand Prince Jin Seong now and present him to the King,

537
00:51:05,220 --> 00:51:09,630
you will be able to preserve your life.

538
00:51:09,630 --> 00:51:16,190
However, if you use a clumsy trick to save both,

539
00:51:17,270 --> 00:51:21,460
you will not be able to preserve your life.

540
00:51:24,370 --> 00:51:27,260
If he comes today empty-handed as well,

541
00:51:28,600 --> 00:51:31,650
I will have to make a decision about not being able

542
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:35,560
to confirm his loyalty.

543
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,700
Your father the First Vice Premier and the rest of your family

544
00:51:39,700 --> 00:51:43,960
will be punished for treason.

545
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,990
Your Majesty!

546
00:51:47,690 --> 00:51:52,760
Then, even if you have that permission to leave to the countryside,

547
00:51:52,760 --> 00:51:55,970
you won't be able to leave.

548
00:51:59,590 --> 00:52:01,780
Isn't that so?

549
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:19,010
Did I turn you into this kind of person?

550
00:52:20,240 --> 00:52:22,250
That's right.

551
00:52:24,380 --> 00:52:29,790
 Whenever I come to Hanyang, I meet Your Majesty on the streets and not the palace. 

552
00:52:29,790 --> 00:52:31,840
  Oh!  

553
00:52:32,990 --> 00:52:35,330
 Y-Your Majesty. 

554
00:52:35,330 --> 00:52:38,180
 If it's Your Majesty's mother, 

555
00:52:38,180 --> 00:52:41,700
 she's also like a mother to me. 

556
00:52:41,700 --> 00:52:43,900
  Didn't you say it's a black-and-white drawing?  

557
00:52:43,900 --> 00:52:46,780
  Didn't you say it's a painting of Chinese roses?  

558
00:52:46,780 --> 00:52:48,990
 Chae Gyeong! 

559
00:52:50,110 --> 00:52:51,200
 Your Majesty. 

560
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,060
 There must be nothing the King cannot have! Isn't that right? 

561
00:52:55,060 --> 00:52:58,190
 Therefore, I must have you too. 

562
00:52:58,190 --> 00:53:01,280
 Chae Gyeong. Sin Chae Gyeong! 

563
00:53:03,150 --> 00:53:05,330
 Your Majesty. 

564
00:53:08,730 --> 00:53:12,410
Why do you have someone like me in your heart,

565
00:53:13,270 --> 00:53:16,050
and take this difficult path?

566
00:53:16,050 --> 00:53:20,230
I cannot stay by your side.

567
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,950
However, you still came.

568
00:53:24,860 --> 00:53:28,660
If you're already in my heart, you're my person.

569
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:30,970
I can't just give you to someone else.

570
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:33,480
But you already gave me to someone else.

571
00:53:33,480 --> 00:53:38,000
By your royal command, you brought us two together.

572
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,860
I regret it.

573
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:44,360
Thus, I have to at least correct it now.

574
00:53:50,150 --> 00:53:52,220
Yoon Myeong Hye.

575
00:53:52,220 --> 00:53:54,080
Pardon?

576
00:53:54,080 --> 00:53:56,330
What's wrong with your hand?

577
00:53:58,260 --> 00:54:01,040
We don't have to paste bulletins anymore.

578
00:54:13,910 --> 00:54:16,040
 What are you doing? 

579
00:54:17,730 --> 00:54:20,300
 It's nothing. 

580
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:24,550
What's going on? You're deceiving me now, aren't you?

581
00:54:24,550 --> 00:54:27,860
Let's go for now. You'll find out when you're there.

582
00:54:27,860 --> 00:54:30,730
There is something going on with the gang, isn't that right?

583
00:54:34,110 --> 00:54:36,220
Orabeoni!

584
00:54:37,530 --> 00:54:40,110
Search everywhere!

585
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:59,310
  The person who should be the real king is Grand Prince Jin Seong. 

586
00:54:59,310 --> 00:55:02,800
 The late king left a will. 

587
00:55:06,790 --> 00:55:09,190
Seo No. What are you doing, you rascal? What are you doing?

588
00:55:09,190 --> 00:55:13,130
- Seo No! 
- Don't just put our things outside. Something's strange.

589
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:16,720
Here, a bulletin saying we have plotted treason is mixed in together.

590
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:18,500
What?

591
00:55:22,790 --> 00:55:26,280
No way, now what is this? Who did this?

592
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:30,900
If this gets found out, the Snail Brides will be annihilated.

593
00:55:58,430 --> 00:56:01,960
If you want to undo all the wrong you have done up till now,

594
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:05,590
do as I tell you.

595
00:56:13,630 --> 00:56:15,800
Oh my!

596
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:20,800
It could be mixed in along with the stuff we put outside.

597
00:56:20,800 --> 00:56:22,960
- Let's go. 
- Yes.

598
00:56:24,640 --> 00:56:27,430
Run! We are surrounded by the royal forces.

599
00:56:27,430 --> 00:56:30,130
Hurry!

600
00:56:31,430 --> 00:56:33,360
Go!

601
00:56:53,470 --> 00:57:00,990
By now, the troops of the Royal Investigative Forces would have already raided the hideout of the Snail Brides.

602
00:57:01,860 --> 00:57:07,670
What do I need to do for your fury to subside?

603
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:10,870
You will get to find out soon enough.

604
00:57:10,870 --> 00:57:16,590
You will come and look for me on your own volition.

605
00:57:18,200 --> 00:57:20,570
Father-in-law.

606
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:27,110
That's the Chief Royal Secretary Im Sa Hong.

607
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:30,370
Soon, the door will be opened.

608
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:34,260
Hurry and run away.

609
00:57:34,260 --> 00:57:38,230
If you let me go like this, you will be put in a difficult situation.

610
00:57:38,230 --> 00:57:42,440
Thus, don't come near here again.

611
00:57:42,440 --> 00:57:47,030
Take Chae Gyeong and run away as fast as you can.

612
00:57:53,810 --> 00:57:56,010
For the last time,

613
00:57:56,820 --> 00:57:59,340
as Chae Gyeong's father and

614
00:58:00,180 --> 00:58:02,960
as your father-in-law,

615
00:58:04,170 --> 00:58:08,000
it will be the final decision I will make.

616
00:58:16,560 --> 00:58:18,710
Hurry!

617
00:58:21,810 --> 00:58:24,040
Catch them!

618
00:58:44,170 --> 00:58:48,170
You made the wrong decision.

619
00:59:03,170 --> 00:59:06,540
  The person who should be the real king is Grand Prince Jin Seong. The late king left a will. 

620
00:59:26,400 --> 00:59:30,600
It's a trap. Go to the mountain cabin right way and disband the Snail Brides.

621
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:32,790
Spread the news to the contacts urgently.

622
00:59:32,790 --> 00:59:36,530
If something goes wrong and someone gets caught, everyone will be caught one by one. Do you understand?

623
00:59:36,530 --> 00:59:39,010
- I understand.
- Hurry and go!

624
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:44,540
 Don't come near here again. 

625
00:59:44,540 --> 00:59:48,180
 Take Chae Gyeong and run away as fast as you can. 

626
00:59:48,180 --> 00:59:52,270
Your Majesty, the Chief Royal Secretary has entered.

627
00:59:52,270 --> 00:59:54,040
Enter.

628
01:00:00,020 --> 01:00:01,600
Father!

629
01:00:01,600 --> 01:00:03,910
Chae Gyeong!

630
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:16,240
Your Majesty, the First Vice Premier also let a traitor escape.

631
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:23,340
And this is evidence that the Snail Brides are a traitorous group.

632
01:00:28,270 --> 01:00:32,010
 The person who should be the real king is Grand Prince Jin Seong. 

633
01:00:32,010 --> 01:00:35,410
 The late King left a will. 

634
01:00:38,870 --> 01:00:43,940
Did you really betray me?

635
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:45,810
Your Majesty!

636
01:00:45,810 --> 01:00:48,170
Father.

637
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:50,710
Your Majesty.

638
01:00:50,710 --> 01:00:56,240
Then as promised, I will have to take your life.

639
01:00:57,440 --> 01:01:02,880
Chae Gyeong will probably have to die first.

640
01:01:07,540 --> 01:01:09,940
Your Majesty!

641
01:01:11,240 --> 01:01:20,420


642
01:01:21,370 --> 01:01:28,070
♫  I can't do anything else but leave even though I don't want to go  ♫

643
01:01:28,070 --> 01:01:35,610
♫  I know now that I can't live without you  ♫

644
01:01:35,610 --> 01:01:39,380
 Queen for Seven Days Preview 

645
01:01:39,380 --> 01:01:43,940
 Look Hyungnim, the King doesn't change. 

646
01:01:43,940 --> 01:01:48,090
  Is it alright as long as you are safe by using the lives of others as a sword and a shield?  

647
01:01:48,090 --> 01:01:52,080
  It's possible to kill one person instantly by 

648
01:01:52,080 --> 01:01:53,940
 accusing him of being a traitor without any clear evidence. 

649
01:01:53,940 --> 01:01:58,480
 Since you run wild in front of me while holding a sword, it makes my blood boil. 

650
01:01:58,480 --> 01:02:03,210
 What's the point of having a throne if beliefs and principles collapse? 

651
01:02:03,210 --> 01:02:06,110
 You two should protect each other. 

652
01:02:06,110 --> 01:02:08,310
 Isn't it all over now? 

653
01:02:08,310 --> 01:02:12,420
 You will surely request something you shouldn't have. 

654
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,700
 I can't give it to you.
