1
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,880
What are you talking about right now?

2
00:00:46,370 --> 00:00:50,070
I came out today with the intention of this being our last.

3
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:53,280
Let's stop seeing each other now.

4
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,430
I don't want to!

5
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,460
I said, I don't want to.

6
00:01:06,890 --> 00:01:08,650
With whose permission?

7
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,920
I will release you after I count to 10.

8
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:28,470
Before that, please promise me.

9
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:32,210
How furious you must have been,

10
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:36,210
how sorrowful you must have been,

11
00:01:37,970 --> 00:01:40,370
I can more than presume.

12
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,390
Therefore, until your anger dissolves, you can get angry at me,

13
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:52,480
hit me, and bother me all you want,

14
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,610
but...

15
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:01,630
please don't say you won't ever see me again.

16
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,380
I returned because

17
00:02:08,230 --> 00:02:10,030
I couldn't live without seeing you.

18
00:02:25,190 --> 00:02:30,600
You promised me! You were just angry, just sulky, today!

19
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,040
Perfect timing.

20
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:49,160
Your Majesty.

21
00:02:50,780 --> 00:02:52,860
You two are together.

22
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:18,800
It seems like our worries came true.

23
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:27,010
You two suited each other quite well earlier.

24
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,350
Marriage is all that's left.

25
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:39,400
Get married.

26
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:43,910
Your Majesty, what do you mean by marriage all of a sudden?

27
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:49,300
It is a royal command.

28
00:03:56,980 --> 00:03:58,430
Hyungnim!

29
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,950
I haven't even received Chae Gyeong's approval yet.

30
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:06,100
Everything else is up to you.

31
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:10,680
Is there a reason why you're suddenly rushing things like this?

32
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:13,000
Didn't you want this?

33
00:04:14,570 --> 00:04:16,710
So, I'm just helping you.

34
00:04:22,610 --> 00:04:26,990
Marriage? On top of that, he even said it was a royal command.

35
00:04:26,990 --> 00:04:30,150
What is the reason His Majesty is suddenly acting like that?

36
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:35,630
By any chance, is there something I don't know about?

37
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:38,720
I couldn't possibly understand all of His Majesty's intentions,

38
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,570
but it seems it'll be difficult to defy a royal command.

39
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:48,220
Then are you saying we should wed Grand Prince Jin Seong and Chae Gyeong?

40
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:50,710
What about the head nun's prophesy?

41
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:57,380
She said that a bloodbath will occur if Chae Gyeong becomes close to a member of the royal family!

42
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:01,940
Prophesy?

43
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:06,970
First Vice-Premier, do you believe such a ridiculous prophesy?

44
00:05:06,970 --> 00:05:10,630
We can't just ignore it either!

45
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:15,130
For me, it concerns my daughter's safety.

46
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:21,710
As for Chae Gyeong, it concerns the fate of herself and those she loves.

47
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:27,680
Do you think that way too?

48
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,920
Is that prophesy more important than me?

49
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:40,370
So, is that why you ignored me, pushed me out, and turned away?

50
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:06,740
A prophesy?

51
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:39,080
  Hyungnim,  since you treasure me so much, I'll escort you properly  today. 

52
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,920
  Don't call me "Hyungnim." 

53
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,320
  Wow, you're strong! 

54
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:45,280
  I remember when we first met. 

55
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,070
  His Majesty says he misses his mother. 

56
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,580
  My family members are innocent. 

57
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,670
  If someone has to be punished, I will take the punishment. 

58
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:11,370
Did you know?

59
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:18,630
That fleeting glance, that spark at the end of our fingertips when we touch,

60
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:22,310
that trivial bastard called "love"

61
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:26,970
was in here too?

62
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:32,690
Would there be anything I do not know about you, Your Majesty?

63
00:07:33,990 --> 00:07:36,090
Then?

64
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:39,800
- Why didn't you tell me? 
 - Your Majesty...

65
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:44,150
You should have told me before I became this petty.

66
00:07:44,150 --> 00:07:46,320
You should have stopped me!

67
00:07:46,320 --> 00:07:49,500
You dare, you dare to!

68
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:54,440
Who are you to make me this miserable?

69
00:07:55,860 --> 00:08:01,090
I considered you as part of my family,

70
00:08:01,090 --> 00:08:05,630
as my friend, as my refuge!

71
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:10,630
Yet, you accepted another man's embrace?

72
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:14,230
I'm going to kill you.

73
00:08:14,230 --> 00:08:18,520
If I cannot have you beside me in life, I'll kill you

74
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,500
to keep you beside me in death!

75
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,720
Y-Your Majesty, Your Majesty...

76
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,480
Your Majesty...

77
00:09:07,370 --> 00:09:08,890
Now,

78
00:09:10,140 --> 00:09:12,840
marriage is all that's left.

79
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:16,890
Afterwards, you can take her as your concubine.

80
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:22,490
Then, although that child's body will remain next to Grand Prince Jin Seong,

81
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:25,320
she will live as your woman

82
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:30,490
under your royal command.

83
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,060
I'll make them have the most

84
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:45,000
hellish marriage on this Earth.

85
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:57,100
Once we pass the relief crops to Kwonduk-bang, Joongshin-bang, and Chansung-bang, it will be over.

86
00:09:57,100 --> 00:10:01,450
Everyone was jumping for joy to see the Snail Brides again for the first time in a while.

87
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,230
The culprit who raided the ministers' storage houses

88
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:06,410
was the Chief Royal Secretary. Your suspicions were correct, Orabeoni.

89
00:10:06,410 --> 00:10:10,350
These two have infiltrated the private army of Im Sa Hong.

90
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:13,060
I know he wishes to harm you,

91
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:16,190
but does stealing even from other ministers' storage houses make sense?

92
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,270
He's someone who could even raid the King's storage house. There's nothing to be surprised about.

93
00:10:21,270 --> 00:10:23,230
First, try to find about Im Sa Hong's secret storage house.

94
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:24,690
Yes, sir!

95
00:10:24,690 --> 00:10:31,290
I can't just watch him fill his own stomach with others' money.

96
00:10:31,290 --> 00:10:33,130
Leave.

97
00:10:35,590 --> 00:10:38,060
Oh and my brother

98
00:10:38,060 --> 00:10:40,180
gave me permission to get married.

99
00:10:40,180 --> 00:10:42,760
Oh! So you will no longer be a bachelor at last?!

100
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:44,630
Did you propose to Lady Chae Gyeong already?

101
00:10:44,630 --> 00:10:47,180
Did you get the approval, sir?

102
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,930
This is not just any ordinary marriage.

103
00:10:48,930 --> 00:10:54,020
This is just one of many steps towards achieving our ultimate goal.  Why are you people so frivolous?

104
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,880
Orabeoni, keep in mind that I'm going along with you right now,

105
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,390
but don't forget that you will owe me your life by taking full responsibility if you make the wrong choice.

106
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:08,480
Don't you worry, Chae Gyeong

107
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,460
will become my woman in the end.

108
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:24,100
 You two looked so good together. Get married. 

109
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:27,000
 Do you think that way too? 

110
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,260
 Is that mere prophecy more important than me? 

111
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:39,030
Is the prophecy more important or is the royal command more important?

112
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:40,790
Or...

113
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:45,670
is the heart more important?

114
00:11:45,670 --> 00:11:47,630
The heart.

115
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:51,340
For sure it is.

116
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:10,410
 For me, it concerns my daughter's safety.  

117
00:12:10,410 --> 00:12:13,500
 As for Chae Gyeong, 

118
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:17,540
 it concerns the fate of those she loves and herself. 

119
00:12:25,450 --> 00:12:29,860
Hyungnim, is something the matter?

120
00:12:29,860 --> 00:12:32,130
My brother

121
00:12:32,830 --> 00:12:36,870
tried to kill me because of our late father's will.

122
00:12:38,450 --> 00:12:44,630
And Chae Gyeong is caught up by a prophecy left by some nun.

123
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:49,300
That is why she is pushing me away.

124
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:52,290
Why is everyone treating me this way?

125
00:12:54,570 --> 00:12:56,440
They have the right to.

126
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:57,810
What?

127
00:12:57,810 --> 00:13:03,270
Because they are afraid. Even when you were a child, because of what grown ups said,

128
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:07,730
you were afraid of your brother who is the King. You pretended not to see nor hear anything.

129
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:10,300
Didn't you say that's how you lived?

130
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:14,660
Lady Chae Gyeong was the person who helped you realize that and muster up some courage.

131
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,230
So this time, you should help Lady Chae Gyeong.

132
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:20,830
There's something more important than superstition, a prophecy, and what someone else says.

133
00:13:20,830 --> 00:13:24,210
You should tell her these things.

134
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:28,420
If you're going to marry her, you should start by instilling trust.

135
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:33,240
Why are you looking at me like that?

136
00:13:44,590 --> 00:13:47,990
It's because I'm proud of you, you punk.

137
00:13:47,990 --> 00:13:51,080
You're all grown up.

138
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,100
You are an adult now.

139
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:56,130
I've been an adult for quite some time now.

140
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:59,190
I'm also physically bigger than you.

141
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:04,550
I'm just a tiny little child in your memory, that's all.

142
00:14:06,030 --> 00:14:10,360
Hey, you tiny little child. Chae Gyeong told me something.

143
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,800
She said that she misses you.

144
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,790
She wants to meet with you tomorrow.

145
00:14:17,930 --> 00:14:19,340
Really?

146
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:22,320
Of course it's for real.

147
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,640
Then I must get ready.

148
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,640
Are you that happy?

149
00:14:45,470 --> 00:14:47,820
I greet you, Queen Dowager.

150
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:50,390
Yes, First Vice-Premier.

151
00:14:50,390 --> 00:14:56,500
It looks like the His Majesty has invited both of us. Do you know what it's about?

152
00:14:56,500 --> 00:14:58,790
We will find out once we go in and see him.

153
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:11,670
Yeok, the Grand Prince Jin Seong

154
00:15:11,670 --> 00:15:15,320
requested permission to get married to your daughter.

155
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:19,060
I guess it's not a bad thing, since there were talks about their marriage when they were young.

156
00:15:19,060 --> 00:15:23,060
What do you two think about this?

157
00:15:24,290 --> 00:15:29,740
It's a good thing.  It's also good for the peace of the royal court and the royal family.

158
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:31,510
Your Highness.

159
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:36,640
Why are you so surprised? As long as the Grand Prince Jin Seong has returned alive,

160
00:15:36,640 --> 00:15:40,990
the fate of those children is already decided, right?

161
00:15:44,970 --> 00:15:47,790
What do you think?

162
00:15:50,140 --> 00:15:53,830
My child is lacking in many areas.

163
00:15:53,830 --> 00:15:57,400
How could I not be aware of that?

164
00:15:57,400 --> 00:16:00,710
 Are you saying this is all about your own survival? 

165
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:03,930
 You push my son into a corner and you think only about yourself?! 

166
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:08,780
 I will never forget about what happened today! 

167
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:11,890
But, it's alright.

168
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:15,560
I will keep her by my side and teach her well.

169
00:16:18,300 --> 00:16:23,070
Please, please take good care of her, Your Highness.

170
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:30,130
Everything is settled then! Congratulations, Mother.

171
00:16:30,130 --> 00:16:35,460
Now that Grand Prince Jin Seong is becoming the First Vice-Premier's son-in-law, how reassured you must be.

172
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:40,490
This isn't just about the First Vice-Premier. You are more

173
00:16:40,490 --> 00:16:43,610
of an ally that will give the Grand Prince even greater reassurance.

174
00:16:43,610 --> 00:16:50,270
There are so many allies. Yeok must be a very blessed man. Don't you agree?

175
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:06,940
You're here.

176
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:16,800
See? It's difficult to use a person's emotions to plot and scheme.

177
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:21,290
After they are married, this will benefit you too.

178
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:25,640
Once that girl from the Sin Clan starts siding with Grand Prince Jin Seong,

179
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:28,770
the relationship between the King and the First Vice-Premier will start becoming awkward.

180
00:17:28,770 --> 00:17:31,750
That would be great if that happened.

181
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:36,170
And I will compensate you greatly.

182
00:17:44,670 --> 00:17:49,470
I'm so nervous. Do you think Lady Chae Gyeong will recognize me?

183
00:17:50,220 --> 00:17:51,930
Nope.

184
00:17:53,910 --> 00:17:57,200
You have changed so much, you know.

185
00:17:57,200 --> 00:17:58,570
Have I?

186
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:01,890
Don't think about anything else, just remember what I told you last night.

187
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,600
About what?

188
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,630
 - Congratulations.
- Then, what about your plan? 

189
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:08,910
 So, you guys should support me tomorrow. 

190
00:18:08,910 --> 00:18:09,700
 With what? 

191
00:18:09,700 --> 00:18:10,600
 How? 

192
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:12,180
 Support you, how? 

193
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:17,180
Help me. Back me up properly without any doubt. Today will be my last chance.

194
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,910
But still, am I not the main character today?

195
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:28,510
Oh, she's here.

196
00:18:28,510 --> 00:18:30,400
Don't play so dirty.

197
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,970
We can both be the main characters.

198
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:34,980
There can only be one main character.

199
00:18:41,970 --> 00:18:43,610
Chae Gyeong—

200
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:46,830
Long time no see, Young Lady.

201
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:53,140
Let's do it together, alright.

202
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:44,570
You're the prettiest when you sleep, my Chae Gyeong.

203
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:48,070
But isn't this the first time you're seeing her sleep?

204
00:19:55,330 --> 00:19:56,170
Your Highness.

205
00:19:56,170 --> 00:19:58,010
Did you sleep well?

206
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,900
Are you alright?

207
00:20:09,090 --> 00:20:12,170
Oh, you are...?

208
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:14,630
Do you recognize me?

209
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:18,570
Aren't you that prison guard from before?

210
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:30,080
Could it be...?

211
00:20:30,940 --> 00:20:33,820
Are you Seo No?!

212
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,760
I told you to just send Seo No. Why did you tag along?

213
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,130
Aren't we all friends? Needle and thread are supposed to travel together.

214
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:49,340
Where a crockpot goes the radish kimchee must follow.
 (Where the main dish goes, the side dish follows.) 

215
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:57,530
Have you been well? Your father, is he doing well?

216
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,950
 Rice is just an excuse. 

217
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:06,610
 What must I do? Your father must not be caught 

218
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:11,150
 by the Queen and her people until it's the right time. 

219
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:15,880
 Seo No, your father... 

220
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:19,110
  will make sure to return. 

221
00:21:22,040 --> 00:21:24,980
I don't really know about my father either.

222
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:30,070
In case the royal forces chase after my father again and make things inconvenient for your relatives too,

223
00:21:30,350 --> 00:21:32,740
he just left me in someone's care and left.

224
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:39,210
Don't worry. He will come find me soon.

225
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:45,170
 I think it's worrisome. 

226
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,730
The King personally came forward and suggested marriage?

227
00:21:47,730 --> 00:21:50,870
Doesn't that mean he trusts the First Vice-Premier  that much?

228
00:21:50,870 --> 00:21:55,230
The First Vice-Premier will never stand on Grand Prince Jin Seong's side.

229
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:58,220
Unless Yeok stops being stubborn,

230
00:21:58,220 --> 00:22:01,040
there is only one solution.

231
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:05,560
We must ensure that wench from the Sin clan will be on Yeok's side.

232
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:08,960
Still, will we be able to bring the First Vice-Premier's heart with her?

233
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,930
No parent can win over their child.

234
00:22:12,930 --> 00:22:17,290
We have the life of his precious daughter in our hands.

235
00:22:17,290 --> 00:22:20,200
What can the First Vice-Premier do?

236
00:22:20,200 --> 00:22:23,300
If Grand Prince Jin Seong  plots treason,

237
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:25,680
whose side will you stand on?

238
00:22:25,680 --> 00:22:30,590
Your Majesty, please take back your words. Treason is nonsense.

239
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:32,890
If.

240
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,950
I'm asking   if   it happens.

241
00:22:37,950 --> 00:22:41,480
Of course I will help you, Your Majesty,

242
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:45,540
and protect Joseon's Royal Court and order.

243
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:54,660
Even if Grand Prince Jin Seong becomes your son-in-law?

244
00:22:54,660 --> 00:22:57,060
Of course, Your Majesty.

245
00:22:57,060 --> 00:23:00,530
Before I am Grand Prince Jin Seong's father-in-law,

246
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:04,980
I am your subject and a minister of this Royal Court.

247
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,980
If anyone plots treason, I will risk my life to stop it.

248
00:23:09,980 --> 00:23:12,490
Do not forget that.

249
00:23:12,490 --> 00:23:18,440
In this Royal Family and Royal Court, you are

250
00:23:19,070 --> 00:23:21,200
the sole subject I truly trust.

251
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:22,800
Your Majesty.

252
00:23:24,350 --> 00:23:27,890
 ♫ Just cooked spring greens. 

253
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:31,360
 ♫ Fragrant spring greens. 

254
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:33,660
 Come here now. 

255
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:42,240
  Your Highness the Crown Prince, I apologize but His Majesty the King has ordered for no one to come close. 

256
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,670
  I am different. 

257
00:23:44,670 --> 00:23:46,370
  Move aside. 

258
00:23:49,570 --> 00:23:51,500
  Your Highness the Crown Prince. 

259
00:23:53,620 --> 00:23:56,700
  I want to go over there and watch my younger brother's talents, 

260
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:59,890
  but they prevent me from doing so. 

261
00:23:59,890 --> 00:24:04,370
  What about horseback racing with me today? 

262
00:24:04,370 --> 00:24:07,310
  I want to spend time with my family. 

263
00:24:07,310 --> 00:24:09,730
  If you wish, 

264
00:24:09,730 --> 00:24:14,800
  I can become your father, your mother, 

265
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,280
  and your younger brother. 

266
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:23,380
The moment you betray me,

267
00:24:24,110 --> 00:24:28,690
I will utilize all of my power

268
00:24:28,690 --> 00:24:33,250
to kill you, your wife,

269
00:24:33,250 --> 00:24:36,930
your children, your relatives,

270
00:24:37,540 --> 00:24:42,160
and everyone around you.

271
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:47,470
Of course Chae Gyeong will be the first to die.

272
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:52,480
Your Majesty, nothing will happen.

273
00:24:52,480 --> 00:24:55,230
Please trust me!

274
00:25:07,050 --> 00:25:12,330
  You're not leaving? You should know when to step in and when to leave! 

275
00:25:12,330 --> 00:25:15,580
  What are you talking about? You're the third wheel here. 

276
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,450
About yesterday...

277
00:25:34,450 --> 00:25:39,760
You asked if that mere prophecy was more important than you.

278
00:25:40,710 --> 00:25:44,290
It's not because the prophecy is more important than you,

279
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:53,440
but because you are so precious, I am afraid of that prophecy.

280
00:25:55,690 --> 00:25:58,740
You experienced it countless times too.

281
00:25:58,740 --> 00:26:01,920
Every time we met, something bad happened.

282
00:26:01,920 --> 00:26:07,370
Whenever we were together, you were in danger.

283
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,170
You almost died because of me.

284
00:26:13,170 --> 00:26:19,040
No, because of you, I was able to survive on the brink of death.

285
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:22,420
I was able to return alive because you were waiting for me.

286
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:26,750
Yet, to me who survived through hell,

287
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:30,860
you tell me we should stop meeting because of the ridiculous prophecy or whatever.

288
00:26:30,860 --> 00:26:32,680
Isn't that being too irresponsible?

289
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:36,340
Wanting to meet even after hearing such a prophecy is even more irresponsible!

290
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:39,730
You're planning to follow that curse-like prophecy until the end?

291
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:43,440
Then what should I do?

292
00:26:45,180 --> 00:26:46,990
You...

293
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:51,890
you can live according to your fate.

294
00:26:51,890 --> 00:26:54,230
Then it won't do all the more.

295
00:26:55,910 --> 00:26:58,800
If your fate is that prophecy,

296
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:03,520
then my fate is you, Chae Gyeong.

297
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:08,190
You are my fate.

298
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:24,360
- What the heck?!
- You asked us to push you so we pushed you! 
 (T/N: to push means to root for, support) 

299
00:27:24,360 --> 00:27:26,640
Is that what I meant?!

300
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:28,810
No, no, no!

301
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:33,040
One, two!
♫   You can leave comfortably   ♫

302
00:27:33,040 --> 00:27:35,500
I told you to let me go!
♫   Wake up from that harsh dream   ♫

303
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:41,470
♫   As time passes,   ♫

304
00:27:41,470 --> 00:27:44,660
♫   as you count the seasons,   ♫

305
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:47,590
♫   will you forget    ♫

306
00:27:47,590 --> 00:27:49,390
♫   the painful memories too?   ♫

307
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,180
Sin Chae Gyeong!
♫   The feeling that   ♫

308
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:53,900
Sin Chae Gyeong!
♫   it was all my fault festers  in my heart  ♫

309
00:27:53,900 --> 00:28:00,010
♫   This heart is tinged with the color red,   ♫

310
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:04,220
♫   just think that you've been drenched   ♫

311
00:28:04,220 --> 00:28:05,930
Go inside.
♫   by the sunset   ♫

312
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:08,830
No, you should leave first.
♫   It's okay   ♫

313
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:10,740
You should go inside first.
♫   Leave comfortably  ♫

314
00:28:10,740 --> 00:28:13,200
No, my house is right ahead.
♫   Don't look back   ♫

315
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:17,160
It's only right that you should leave first.
♫   Don't worry   ♫

316
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:21,140
My house is very far away from here,
♫   Don't dwell over past memories   ♫

317
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:25,340
so it's only right that you should go in first. 
♫   The time we   ♫

318
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:28,660
♫   spent together   ♫

319
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:32,690
Since earlier, I was wondering why my feet refused to move.
♫   I will remember alone   ♫

320
00:28:32,690 --> 00:28:37,980
♫   My dear, my dear, I will   ♫

321
00:28:37,980 --> 00:28:43,350
♫   light my love in the night sky every night   ♫

322
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:49,060
♫   Yearn and yearn, if you cannot forget me,   ♫

323
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:52,120
♫   please remember me   ♫

324
00:28:52,120 --> 00:28:53,550
What are you doing?

325
00:28:53,550 --> 00:28:58,510
You said that if we make a promise, there has to be a token.
♫   when the moonlight shines down  ♫

326
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:04,960
I haven't answered yet nor have I promised anything.

327
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:07,790
Must you say it in words? 
♫   Please think of me  ♫

328
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:10,250
I've already heard everything.

329
00:29:17,030 --> 00:29:22,560
Am I truly allowed to do this?

330
00:29:24,520 --> 00:29:29,740
Am I allowed to believe what you said earlier

331
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,450
and be courageous?

332
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:36,050
Yes.

333
00:29:36,050 --> 00:29:40,690
Are you confident you won't regret this?

334
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:42,360
Of course.

335
00:29:44,580 --> 00:29:48,000
I will ask one last time.

336
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:51,940
Are you not afraid

337
00:29:52,890 --> 00:29:56,350
of the prophecy about me and my fate?

338
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:03,460
I could ruin your life, Your Highness.

339
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:06,580
Without you,

340
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:10,820
my life will be ruined anyway.

341
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:28,800
Tomorrow, I'll properly prepare the proposal gift and come again.

342
00:30:41,140 --> 00:30:43,570
This is good enough for me.

343
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,060
What are you doing?

344
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:40,910
Now you have promised.

345
00:31:40,910 --> 00:31:43,210
I have promised.

346
00:31:56,860 --> 00:32:00,720
Are you truly planning on allowing Chae Gyeong to marry Grand Prince Jin Seong?

347
00:32:00,720 --> 00:32:03,180
It's a royal command!

348
00:32:04,150 --> 00:32:09,580
Not only the prophesy, in many ways it's a road filled with obstacles.

349
00:32:13,960 --> 00:32:17,250
Please trust me, Wife.

350
00:32:17,250 --> 00:32:19,130
Chae Gyeong and Grand Prince Jin Seong

351
00:32:19,130 --> 00:32:24,190
will age together as eternal friends, just like us.

352
00:32:25,620 --> 00:32:28,320
I'll ensure that happens.

353
00:32:32,370 --> 00:32:34,390
Your Highness the Grand Prince!

354
00:32:35,700 --> 00:32:36,770
Did you wait for me?

355
00:32:36,770 --> 00:32:40,630
Yes, His Majesty the King kept requesting for you.

356
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:46,200
Has Yeok still not returned?

357
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,850
Yes, Your Majesty. Although we've sent someone every hour to check on Her Highness the Queen Dowager's quarters,

358
00:32:50,850 --> 00:32:53,150
he still has not entered the palace.

359
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:55,910
Those two are still together?

360
00:32:55,910 --> 00:32:58,410
Those two will soon marry.

361
00:32:58,410 --> 00:33:00,610
Please become accustomed to it.

362
00:33:00,610 --> 00:33:05,450
  Your Majesty, His Highness the Grand Prince is here. 

363
00:33:10,570 --> 00:33:14,040
Your Majesty, did you ask for me?

364
00:33:18,990 --> 00:33:23,800
What is with all that water? Did you get caught in the rain?

365
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:28,520
Goodness, I dried it as much as I could. Is it still obvious?

366
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:32,570
Because the kids were fooling around, I fell into the creek.

367
00:33:32,570 --> 00:33:35,940
Whether it's in the past or in the present, you still have fun.

368
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:38,880
My friends are very mischievous.

369
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:41,100
Do you want to enter too?

370
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:49,550
If Your Majesty wishes to speak to me, I will wait in the Study Hall.

371
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:56,660
He's become even more arrogant as an adult.

372
00:33:56,660 --> 00:34:00,770
I presumed he was just immature when he was younger.

373
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:12,800
Are marriage preparations going well?

374
00:34:14,850 --> 00:34:21,940
Yes, today I finally received Chae Gyeong's approval.

375
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,420
Quite impressive.

376
00:34:25,420 --> 00:34:28,410
Without entering the heart of a woman I love,

377
00:34:28,410 --> 00:34:31,320
how can I call myself a man?

378
00:34:32,930 --> 00:34:35,140
Bull's eye!

379
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:39,850
What is the true reason you wish to marry Chae Gyeong?

380
00:34:42,590 --> 00:34:45,040
My sole reason

381
00:34:47,680 --> 00:34:50,130
is Chae Gyeong herself.

382
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:54,580
Tell me the true reason.

383
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:02,240
Chae Gyeong

384
00:35:04,550 --> 00:35:06,390
is a very...

385
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:10,480
violent woman.

386
00:35:12,630 --> 00:35:14,740
Moreover, she's very

387
00:35:16,810 --> 00:35:18,570
lustful.

388
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:21,630
  You have to come somewhere with me. 

389
00:35:21,630 --> 00:35:23,660
  Just take care of it here. 

390
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:27,970
  Even if I do this? 

391
00:35:28,750 --> 00:35:31,390
Do you think that's all?

392
00:35:31,390 --> 00:35:34,840
She seduces a man unknown to her without hesitation.

393
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,630
  You're the Grand Prince, aren't you? 

394
00:35:36,630 --> 00:35:40,150
  - No.
- You are! 

395
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:43,020
  Why do I keep noticing you? 

396
00:35:44,640 --> 00:35:47,920
And she's such an easy

397
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,660
and wanton woman.

398
00:35:52,090 --> 00:35:55,540
  I'm right, it is you. 

399
00:35:55,540 --> 00:35:58,120
  You're him. 

400
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:07,020
She's even more foolish than a bear.

401
00:36:10,620 --> 00:36:15,480
She's a tiring, and tiring,

402
00:36:17,290 --> 00:36:19,930
and a very tiring woman.

403
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:26,680
That was the reason?

404
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:31,040
Yes,

405
00:36:31,040 --> 00:36:35,000
so I'm the only man

406
00:36:36,580 --> 00:36:39,170
who can handle Chae Gyeong.

407
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:13,320
I hope you two live happily.

408
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:19,000
Yes, Brother.

409
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:29,200
 Today, it ended with a target, 

410
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:32,360
  but next time, it will pierce through your heart. 

411
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:37,010
  You'll pay the price for coveting what's mine. 

412
00:37:41,080 --> 00:37:44,660
 I will yield my target to you anytime. 

413
00:37:44,660 --> 00:37:48,690
  Please look forward to it. Starting with Chae Gyeong, 

414
00:37:48,690 --> 00:37:51,710
  I'll reclaim everything that was once mine. 

415
00:37:54,610 --> 00:37:56,120
  Auntie, thanks for the food! 

416
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:58,660
 - Alright, goodbye!
- Thank you for the food! 

417
00:38:03,010 --> 00:38:05,540
  Myeong Hye, there's nothing to worry about. 

418
00:38:05,540 --> 00:38:10,080
  You're just lending her your position until the rebellion succeeds. 

419
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:13,700
  I'm honored that you would bring this up first, Your Highness. 

420
00:38:13,700 --> 00:38:19,020
  Until His Highness the Grand Prince pushes out the current king and sits on the throne himself, 

421
00:38:19,020 --> 00:38:23,750
  I'll gladly accept anything and everything needed. 

422
00:38:23,750 --> 00:38:27,800
  You're a woman too. How can you not be upset? 

423
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,240
  Yet, you still consider our cause as your first priority. 

424
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:34,270
  You're very dependable and praiseworthy. 

425
00:38:44,650 --> 00:38:48,740
What are you doing? Give it to me.

426
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:54,210
Why are you suddenly worrying about me?

427
00:38:54,210 --> 00:38:57,110
Do you think that, just because Orabeoni is getting married to another woman,

428
00:38:57,110 --> 00:38:59,430
I'm going to fall apart?

429
00:38:59,430 --> 00:39:01,230
Give it to me.

430
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:08,080
I said, give it to me! I won't die just because I drink this much.

431
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,790
That's not it.

432
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:14,810
Your subordinates who entered as spies among the Chief Royal Secretary's guards have just sent a message.

433
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:18,260
They have discovered the secret storage house.

434
00:39:20,510 --> 00:39:22,370
Let's go.

435
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:41,490
Young Lady, what's with your hair?

436
00:39:42,730 --> 00:39:44,230
Ah, nothing! This is nothing.

437
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:49,360
- What is it? Come on, give it to me! 
- It's nothing! Forget it, it's nothing!

438
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:53,690
W-what is this stick? It's not the stick of love.

439
00:39:56,650 --> 00:40:02,710
No way... by any chance, did you wear this as a hairpin?

440
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:07,920
I have to get married too now.

441
00:40:07,920 --> 00:40:13,740
Young Lady, men are creatures that should not be trusted so easily.

442
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,610
I didn't trust him easily. I was careful and investigated—

443
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:20,530
What about his relations with other women? Are you sure they're clean?

444
00:40:20,530 --> 00:40:21,800
Of course.

445
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,250
Are you certain?

446
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,900
Of cou—

447
00:40:33,250 --> 00:40:34,910
What is that?

448
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:35,930
What?

449
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,530
Nanny, I'm doomed.

450
00:40:38,530 --> 00:40:42,080
- Who is it?
- Nanny, hold this for a minute.

451
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:46,190
Who is it? I'm going to, just— Young Lady!

452
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:00,520
Hyungnim.

453
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,630
Where did everyone go? Why do we only have these people?

454
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:07,200
- The Deputy Commander called them. There is an operation today.
- What?

455
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:15,360
Deputy Commander! What are you doing?

456
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,460
Your Highness.

457
00:41:16,460 --> 00:41:19,820
How can you send them out on a mission without my permission?!

458
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,080
Then what was I to do?

459
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:26,930
The Chief Royal Secretary will take care of all the stolen goods in the secret storage tomorrow.

460
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:31,190
You didn't even think of returning and the deadline is approaching.

461
00:41:31,190 --> 00:41:33,760
I thought "Let's recover the items first"

462
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,950
"and report later."

463
00:41:35,950 --> 00:41:37,890
Deputy Commander!

464
00:41:43,030 --> 00:41:48,710
The king demolished ten private houses to build that house because it has a nice view.

465
00:41:48,710 --> 00:41:52,780
Wow! The Chief Royal Secretary took hold of it in that short amount of time?

466
00:42:11,670 --> 00:42:14,470
What if something goes wrong and they get caught?

467
00:42:14,470 --> 00:42:16,230
What will you do then?!

468
00:42:16,230 --> 00:42:20,010
We have to accept such trivial sacrifices to achieve our cause!

469
00:42:20,010 --> 00:42:22,410
They're my friends, my people!

470
00:42:22,410 --> 00:42:26,700
I know, my niece is there too.

471
00:42:51,130 --> 00:42:53,040
I found the jade gemstone.

472
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:57,640
He only stole the expensive things.

473
00:42:57,640 --> 00:43:04,150
What Minister Yoo had stolen from him is a jade gemstone that was passed down for three generations.

474
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:08,260
If that returns, they'll jump for joy.

475
00:43:08,260 --> 00:43:11,330
You want to return the goods to the ministers?

476
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:16,150
Of course, stolen goods should be returned to their rightful owners.

477
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:19,300
Court officials will be really grateful to the Snail Brides.

478
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:24,590
Frankly speaking, the people are the rightful owners.

479
00:43:24,590 --> 00:43:28,450
It's all black money gained from exploiting the people.

480
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:37,630
Your Highness, we are not people who have gathered to play righteous outlaws.

481
00:43:40,230 --> 00:43:44,200
The ministers of Joseon, not only the poor citizens, are also people of Joseon!

482
00:43:44,200 --> 00:43:46,920
We have to pull as many people to our side as possible

483
00:43:46,920 --> 00:43:51,600
so when you plot a coup later on, no one will say anything.

484
00:43:54,550 --> 00:44:02,000
If those ministers had done politics with the intent of bringing the people onto our side,

485
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,030
the nation wouldn't be in this state now.

486
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:10,100
I know.

487
00:44:10,100 --> 00:44:15,430
However, please contain your feelings of regret for now.

488
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:21,420
You can become a wise ruler after you become king.

489
00:44:21,420 --> 00:44:26,090
Now, you just have to use everything and anything you can to become king.

490
00:44:28,380 --> 00:44:33,750
Just like you're using the First Vice-Premier's daughter.

491
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,540
I think it would be best for me to wait for them outside.

492
00:45:25,540 --> 00:45:27,150
Let's go together.

493
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:34,150
Hey! You—

494
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:43,620
Did anything happen?

495
00:45:49,460 --> 00:45:51,290
We recovered everything.

496
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,650
It seems Orabeoni is furious.

497
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:07,200
I thought he had gotten stronger but he's still soft-hearted and weak.

498
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:09,950
He's the same as his younger self.

499
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:13,620
Everything is because of that Sin wench.

500
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:16,330
She's ruining him.

501
00:46:16,330 --> 00:46:20,160
If he's like this now, imagine what'll happen once they're married.

502
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:22,660
You'll have to pay special attention to them.

503
00:46:22,660 --> 00:46:27,760
Yes. If needed, I was planning on assigning someone to monitor them.

504
00:46:28,660 --> 00:46:30,710
But about Seo No,

505
00:46:30,710 --> 00:46:34,010
can he really not get in contact with his father?

506
00:46:34,010 --> 00:46:37,330
Are you sure he's not hiding anything from us?

507
00:46:37,330 --> 00:46:40,970
He doesn't know how to use such tricks.

508
00:46:40,970 --> 00:46:45,560
Everything he sees, he speaks.

509
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:50,570
How peculiar, you're showing interest in another man.

510
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,450
That's my job.

511
00:47:37,480 --> 00:47:39,240
Wow...

512
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:42,950
You weren't followed?

513
00:47:42,950 --> 00:47:44,550
Yes, sir.

514
00:47:44,550 --> 00:47:47,370
Let's quickly clean up now. We have to finish today's task.

515
00:47:48,750 --> 00:47:51,150
Yeok! Since you're here, come help clean!

516
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:53,980
Just worry about yourself! Be diligent about it!

517
00:47:53,980 --> 00:47:56,000
Ugh, this bastard! Seriously!

518
00:47:56,960 --> 00:48:00,580
 Chart of the Court by Name and Rank 

519
00:48:02,890 --> 00:48:06,490
 King: Lee Yoong 

520
00:48:08,710 --> 00:48:10,790
 Important - First Vice-Premier : Sin Soo Geun 

521
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:22,250
 Once we fill this list of signatures with the names of people who want to make you the king, 

522
00:48:22,250 --> 00:48:24,900
 we will start a rebellion. 

523
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:35,590
 Before that, those who don't have their names on that list of signatures, 

524
00:48:35,590 --> 00:48:38,420
 we will have to eliminate them. 

525
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:48,450
 They'll have to decide which side to stand on. 

526
00:48:51,380 --> 00:48:53,690
 Is that going well? 

527
00:48:58,920 --> 00:49:01,780
 King: Lee Yoong. 

528
00:49:24,080 --> 00:49:25,920
Welcome.

529
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:31,760
The thieves hid in there?

530
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:39,890
 Those who don't have their names on that list of signatures, 

531
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:42,620
 we will have to eliminate them. 

532
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:09,320
- What? What's going on?
- Someone's here.

533
00:50:21,820 --> 00:50:23,500
Hey.

534
00:50:24,050 --> 00:50:26,420
What do you think you're doing?!

535
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:39,400
You kick down the door of someone's business in the middle of the night. W-what kind of rude behavior is this?

536
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:43,770
I'm here to catch the thieves who stole my possessions.

537
00:50:44,930 --> 00:50:47,370
What are you talking about?

538
00:50:48,830 --> 00:50:54,090
You look familiar.

539
00:50:55,010 --> 00:51:00,470
Yes, you're Grand Prince Jin Seong's friend.

540
00:51:05,400 --> 00:51:09,080
Then that means His Highness the Grand Prince must visit this place often.

541
00:51:09,080 --> 00:51:12,660
If you're curious about His Highness the Grand Prince,

542
00:51:12,660 --> 00:51:15,200
why don't you go to the palace and ask him yourself?

543
00:51:15,200 --> 00:51:19,320
Well, I have nothing to ask him at the moment.

544
00:51:50,130 --> 00:51:53,350
Goodness, this, this!

545
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,880
Yes, it's squalid.

546
00:52:14,970 --> 00:52:16,960
Seo No!

547
00:52:19,090 --> 00:52:22,860
Have you seen me before?

548
00:52:31,850 --> 00:52:33,650
Of course not.

549
00:52:34,900 --> 00:52:38,600
This is our first meeting.

550
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,080
What's going on?

551
00:52:57,050 --> 00:52:59,150
Young Lady!

552
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,560
Chae Gyeong.

553
00:53:00,560 --> 00:53:04,020
We meet again at a place like this.

554
00:53:04,020 --> 00:53:07,800
Why are you causing a scene at someone else's business?

555
00:53:07,800 --> 00:53:10,000
Now what fault are you planning to find this time?

556
00:53:10,000 --> 00:53:12,090
A fault?

557
00:53:13,360 --> 00:53:17,290
We're in the process of catching a runaway thief.

558
00:53:17,290 --> 00:53:21,420
My subordinates saw him hide in here.

559
00:53:21,420 --> 00:53:26,910
It's as if a ghost is playing a joke. There's no trace of him anywhere in here.

560
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:32,740
It's either one of the two:

561
00:53:32,740 --> 00:53:36,700
1. There's a back door.

562
00:53:36,700 --> 00:53:41,830
2. There's a hidden room.

563
00:53:52,060 --> 00:53:53,770
What about 3?

564
00:53:53,770 --> 00:53:57,820
Why don't you consider the third option?

565
00:54:00,330 --> 00:54:03,050
This man could have seen wrong.

566
00:54:03,050 --> 00:54:08,760
Well, his eyesight doesn't look that great.

567
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:11,410
What?

568
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:27,000
No!

569
00:54:33,070 --> 00:54:38,950
If you mess with an innocent person without any concrete evidence again, I won't stand idly by.

570
00:54:38,950 --> 00:54:41,940
You even know how to wield a sword?

571
00:54:41,940 --> 00:54:43,960
I learned from my father

572
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:48,040
to protect myself from baseless hooligans.

573
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:50,940
Baseless hooligans?

574
00:54:55,990 --> 00:54:58,860
I apologize for the trouble we caused.

575
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:26,000
If it wasn't for Young Lady Chae Gyeong, we would have been in big trouble.

576
00:55:35,870 --> 00:55:40,270
Grand Prince Jin Seong's friends and the First Vice Premier's daughter...

577
00:55:40,270 --> 00:55:46,120
One of them has been together with Grand Prince Jin Seong since the ship-ride.

578
00:55:46,120 --> 00:55:48,920
His name is Seo No?

579
00:55:51,060 --> 00:55:55,030
It's a name I've heard somewhere before.

580
00:55:58,040 --> 00:56:02,060
I wouldn't have any regrets in life if I could just pull that eyeball out!

581
00:56:08,910 --> 00:56:15,500
I don't know why he goes around gazing at people in such an unpleasant manner.

582
00:56:16,680 --> 00:56:21,050
I'm worried he may remember me.

583
00:56:21,050 --> 00:56:23,540
What happens if he remembers you?

584
00:56:23,540 --> 00:56:26,910
Regardless, I'm the son of an escaped criminal.

585
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:31,450
Before, His Highness the Grand Prince was exiled because he helped my father escape from prison.

586
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:38,150
This time around too, if he realizes I'm the son of that escaped criminal, who knows what fault he'll find against His Highness the Grand Prince.

587
00:56:38,150 --> 00:56:43,380
That's the reason why I pretended I didn't know you all this time, Young Lady.

588
00:56:44,300 --> 00:56:49,710
Don't worry, I'm going to make sure he won't be able to bother anyone with that incident.

589
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:02,150
He's obsessed with catching His Highness the Grand Prince.

590
00:57:03,930 --> 00:57:08,520
  Before, His Highness the Grand Prince was exiled because he helped my father escape from prison. 

591
00:57:08,520 --> 00:57:14,020
  Once he realizes I'm the son of that escaped criminal, who knows what fault he'll find against His Highness the Grand Prince? 

592
00:57:29,340 --> 00:57:31,810
The pawn shop?

593
00:57:31,810 --> 00:57:34,380
Although it is a pawn shop by name,

594
00:57:34,380 --> 00:57:38,250
they don't buy or sell expensive items.

595
00:57:38,250 --> 00:57:41,670
It seemed as if most of their clients weren't nobles

596
00:57:41,670 --> 00:57:44,840
but commoners.

597
00:57:44,840 --> 00:57:47,500
I'm sure he didn't just run a pawn shop business

598
00:57:47,500 --> 00:57:50,360
while he remained hidden.

599
00:57:50,360 --> 00:57:55,380
I'm certain the pawn shop is a disguise.

600
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:59,460
Once Grand Prince Jin Seong and Sin Chae Gyeong marry,

601
00:57:59,460 --> 00:58:02,840
what about tasking that child with investigating the pawn shop?

602
00:58:02,840 --> 00:58:07,120
However, if she isn't on our side,

603
00:58:07,120 --> 00:58:10,110
what will happen then?

604
00:58:10,960 --> 00:58:16,480
The First Vice-Premier's daughter was also in that pawn shop.

605
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:22,920
She seemed quite close to those inside the pawn shop, as if she had known them since long ago.

606
00:58:22,920 --> 00:58:28,260
And as soon as I tried to look around the pawn shop, she even blocked me.

607
00:58:28,260 --> 00:58:34,360
Therefore, how can we trust the First Vice-Premier's daughter?

608
00:58:46,850 --> 00:58:48,760
Your Majesty.

609
00:58:50,520 --> 00:58:52,500
What brings you here at this hour?

610
00:58:52,500 --> 00:58:56,230
I came because I have something to tell you.

611
00:58:58,700 --> 00:59:00,950
Let's walk.

612
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:11,420


613
00:59:13,480 --> 00:59:15,970
What did you just say?

614
00:59:15,970 --> 00:59:20,890
I asked if you still suspect His Highness the Grand Prince

615
00:59:20,890 --> 00:59:26,450
and if you could dispose of your suspicions against His Highness the Grand Prince.

616
00:59:26,450 --> 00:59:31,610
Are you implying that I suspect Yeok without reason?

617
00:59:31,610 --> 00:59:33,340
No,

618
00:59:33,340 --> 00:59:38,780
it's true that His Highness the Grand Prince's actions were suspicious.

619
00:59:38,780 --> 00:59:40,490
So?

620
00:59:40,490 --> 00:59:45,790
So, I asked for a method to relieve Your Majesty of your suspicions against His Highness the Grand Prince

621
00:59:45,790 --> 00:59:51,160
and to prove His Highness's loyalty towards you.

622
00:59:53,950 --> 00:59:59,400
After all, he will soon become my husband.

623
01:00:01,090 --> 01:00:04,520
I want to protect him.

624
01:00:06,680 --> 01:00:09,490
How will you protect Yeok?

625
01:00:09,490 --> 01:00:12,730
How will you relieve me of my suspicions against Yeok?

626
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:16,640
How will you prove Yeok's loyalty to me?

627
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:20,560
Who do you think you are? With what right?!

628
01:00:20,560 --> 01:00:21,500
Your Majesty—

629
01:00:21,500 --> 01:00:27,060
You're just... just a mere girl.

630
01:00:27,060 --> 01:00:32,570
You're just a girl. How dare you ridicule me like this?!

631
01:00:32,570 --> 01:00:34,760
I apologize if I overstepped my boundaries—

632
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:36,700
Exactly why?!

633
01:00:38,390 --> 01:00:41,270
Why do you only speak of Yeok?

634
01:00:42,470 --> 01:00:44,450
Your Majesty...

635
01:00:44,450 --> 01:00:50,270
You're in front of me, you're at a distance where I can reach my hand out and touch you,

636
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:58,730
you're looking into my eyes, so why is Yeok the only name coming out of your mouth?

637
01:01:04,730 --> 01:01:10,060
I must have gone insane. I can't believe I tried to send you to another man.

638
01:01:10,940 --> 01:01:15,930
I am the King.

639
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:20,050
This nation's rule is that there must be nothing the King cannot have!

640
01:01:20,050 --> 01:01:23,360
Isn't that right? Therefore,

641
01:01:25,360 --> 01:01:27,670
I must have you too.

642
01:01:37,650 --> 01:01:45,350
♫   I want to hold you, the one whose brilliance chills my heart   ♫

643
01:01:45,350 --> 01:01:48,100
♫   I'm afraid you might fly away when the wind blows   ♫
