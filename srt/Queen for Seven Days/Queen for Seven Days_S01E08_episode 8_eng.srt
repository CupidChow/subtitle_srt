1
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,420
  How long were you planning to hide? 

2
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:49,910
  Didn't you feel apologetic when you saw me running after you like a fool? 

3
00:00:53,030 --> 00:00:56,060
  Until when was I planning to deceive you? 

4
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:00,180
  You're dense, stubborn, nosy for no reason, and don't have any fear whatsoever. 

5
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,470
  Look at this! Whenever I'm with you, I get entangled in dangerous affairs! 

6
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:08,720
If Yeok, that bastard, is still alive, why hasn't he appeared in front of me?

7
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,360
Why is he hiding?

8
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:16,360
 He wants to get revenge and take the throne for himself. 

9
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,730
  Episode 8 

10
00:01:26,160 --> 00:01:30,730
  Join the guards of the Chief Royal Secretary and monitor their movements. 

11
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,690
Even if we have to use that Sin wench more,

12
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:36,640
force Grand Prince Jin Seong to come.

13
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:39,190
What about tying her up in front of the marketplace?

14
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:41,680
Tie her in front of the marketplace?

15
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,560
They said that if she was tied up, Grand Prince Jin Seong wouldn't be able to ignore her.

16
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:50,810
Their words are right. Simply hearing of the news

17
00:01:50,810 --> 00:01:55,050
and personally witnessing her suffering is different.

18
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:57,920
His Highness the Grand Prince must appear

19
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:02,260
for this fight to end.

20
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,490
Or...

21
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,540
Or?

22
00:02:06,540 --> 00:02:08,780
Sin Chae Gyeong

23
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:12,420
can disappear.

24
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:28,210
  You endured in this condition? 

25
00:02:28,210 --> 00:02:30,190
Please don't come.

26
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:33,510
You can't come.

27
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,870
It would be better

28
00:02:44,660 --> 00:02:47,770
that you'll be thanking me

29
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:52,970
because this medicine will end your suffering.

30
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,290
What are you doing?

31
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:11,040
Why are you here?

32
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,930
What's with your attire?

33
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:15,820
I came because

34
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:18,910
I was worried.

35
00:03:18,910 --> 00:03:23,600
Me too. I came because I was worried for Orabeoni Nak Cheon.

36
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:28,480
I wanted to monitor her, in case she opened her mouth.

37
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,690
Just as you're here in that attire because you can't sit still,

38
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:35,790
I had the same intentions, so don't think of creating a fuss.

39
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,310
What are you doing?!

40
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:45,490
Exactly how did you get in here?

41
00:03:45,490 --> 00:03:49,390
Let go of me! Release me! You're not going to release me?

42
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:54,900
Well, since you have both money and connections, this wouldn't be a big deal.

43
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,330
Did you get permission from Orabeoni to come here?

44
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:16,660
Don't talk of him.

45
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,560
Ah, you two must have fought.

46
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:38,040
Drag her out!

47
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:58,360
Don't do anything reckless. One wrong move and Sin Chae Gyeong will die too.

48
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:00,420
You know that, right?

49
00:05:00,420 --> 00:05:03,090
I know that much too.

50
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:39,300
Look here!

51
00:05:40,110 --> 00:05:41,780
Look here!

52
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,490
Where are you dragging me off to?

53
00:05:46,490 --> 00:05:48,930
Look here!

54
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,680
If you confess the whereabouts of that thief now,

55
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,060
I'll allow you to return home immediately.

56
00:05:57,060 --> 00:06:01,190
Why are you trying so hard to catch him?!

57
00:06:01,190 --> 00:06:07,720
We're chasing a traitor who stole the royal offerings meant for His Majesty the King.

58
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:11,060
Do we need another reason?

59
00:06:57,480 --> 00:07:02,310
You can't come. You'll die if you come.

60
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:19,700
Please leave.

61
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,580
You have to drink at least one sip to endure.

62
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,770
Thank you for the offer,

63
00:07:31,670 --> 00:07:34,190
but I'm fine.

64
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,330
We're set to ambush.

65
00:08:05,310 --> 00:08:09,680
Spread the rumors as far and as fast as possible.

66
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:14,410
That scoundrel has to hear of this news to come here.

67
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,550
I understand, Sir.

68
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:21,590
Um, you know,

69
00:08:21,590 --> 00:08:25,470
I think the reason he hasn't shown himself yet

70
00:08:25,470 --> 00:08:26,990
is because of the poison.

71
00:08:26,990 --> 00:08:28,300
Poison?

72
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:32,490
Just in case, we shot poisoned arrows. If he hasn't taken the antidote,

73
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,070
he should be intoxicated to the point where it would be difficult to move a limb.

74
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,740
He's someone who survived after being stabbed and rolled off a cliff.

75
00:08:41,740 --> 00:08:47,270
Poison or whatever, do not assume anything.

76
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,760
Regardless of what happens, this time,

77
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:56,960
I will personally confirm his last breath with my own two eyes.

78
00:08:56,960 --> 00:08:59,340
Yes, Sir.

79
00:09:08,780 --> 00:09:12,030
  Royal Offerings Record Book 

80
00:09:18,270 --> 00:09:21,430
  Exactly why did you do something so reckless? 

81
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,870
  You have to restrain yourself and wait for the right time. 

82
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:26,320
  While waiting for that right time, 

83
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,650
  you lost a son. 

84
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,540
  I am planning to find a path that suits me. 

85
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:47,810
Why do you want the organized records of the royal offerings?

86
00:09:47,810 --> 00:09:50,440
I have a use for them.

87
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,430
Um, I thought about it meticulously...

88
00:09:55,770 --> 00:09:59,590
- You fought with Seo No on purpose, didn't you?
- Yes.

89
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,340
Yes?

90
00:10:02,730 --> 00:10:03,890
No.

91
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,440
No? I'm sure it's not a "no."

92
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:10,560
I mean, it's obvious what Seo No will do from now on

93
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,110
and seeing that you are keeping quiet about his actions

94
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:18,270
you want him to protect Sin Chae Gyeong in your place.

95
00:10:22,690 --> 00:10:24,340
Are you alright?

96
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:45,790
They don't call this Large Flower Motherwort for nothing.

97
00:10:45,790 --> 00:10:48,310
Large Flower Motherwort?

98
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,360
And also Asian Lizard's tail.

99
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,360
It has a naturally strong scent when it's used to treat poisonâ€”

100
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:58,780
By any chance, were you poisoned?

101
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,190
Was someone poisoned?

102
00:11:05,290 --> 00:11:09,770
By any chance, were the arrows those bastards shot back then poisoned?

103
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:20,690
Wait a minute. You have a fever too.

104
00:11:20,690 --> 00:11:22,150
Where?

105
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:26,520
Wow, that's intense! Aren't you dizzy?

106
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:28,900
- With a temperature this high, your head should be spinning!
- Doctor...

107
00:11:28,900 --> 00:11:31,020
Call the doctor! Quickly!

108
00:11:37,630 --> 00:11:41,020
He just has a fever. What's with the crybaby act? He could call the doctor himself.

109
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,390
Ugh, my life!

110
00:11:45,150 --> 00:11:46,860
Quickly, quickly!

111
00:11:49,460 --> 00:11:50,870
Come quickly!

112
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:53,470
- What is this ruckus?
- Time is ticking!

113
00:11:53,470 --> 00:11:55,310
So this poison can kill you?

114
00:11:55,310 --> 00:11:59,620
It's not enough to instantly kill someone but it can become dangerous if not treated in time.

115
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,930
Give me the antidote.

116
00:12:00,930 --> 00:12:03,100
You're suffering from the side effects of the detoxification process,

117
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:05,450
so you don't need the antidote.

118
00:12:05,450 --> 00:12:08,530
If you cure it through herbal tonics, you'll gradually recover.

119
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:11,050
There's someone else who was shot by this poisoned arrow.

120
00:12:11,050 --> 00:12:15,360
I'm not a royal physician, just a neighborhood physician. How could I have such an antidote?

121
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,660
It'll take at least half a day to gather the herbs and at least 2 days to create the antidote.

122
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,280
Hyungnim.  Hyungnim.

123
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:28,330
Young Lady Chae Gyeong, she...

124
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,190
Still, are you planning to run away when someone is tied to the cross?

125
00:12:39,190 --> 00:12:42,020
Before the poison kills her, she'll be shot dead by the guard's arrows!

126
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:43,850
Still, I can't just sit still and do nothing.

127
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:47,840
She could faint anytime but she's tied to the cross!

128
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:51,090
She won't be able to endure another day. The poison will spread!

129
00:12:51,090 --> 00:12:53,090
That's why we're saying this!

130
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:55,740
Yeah, let's say that we battle the palace guards,

131
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,090
lose a few of our men's lives, and save that woman.

132
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:03,390
How can we save her when we don't have the antidote? We can't find a royal physician either!

133
00:13:03,390 --> 00:13:06,360
He said that it'll take at least another day to make the antidote!

134
00:13:07,310 --> 00:13:10,860
Even if we have the antidote, it'll be of no use.

135
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,490
Young Lady Chae Gyeong refuses to drink even a sip of water.

136
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:20,320
She seemed as if ... she was determined to die.

137
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:46,890
  I was shot by arrows, stabbed by a sword, 

138
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:50,510
  and after I took my last breath, I rolled off a cliff. 

139
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,460
  Did you really not miss me? 
 â™« Suddenly you filled my entire world   â™«

140
00:13:53,460 --> 00:13:55,780
  What do you think? 

141
00:13:57,310 --> 00:14:02,570
â™«   Suddenly you were there without a sound  â™«

142
00:14:02,570 --> 00:14:06,910
  Once we catch him, I'll release you.  
 â™« The first moment I saw you   â™«

143
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:12,160
  If you wish for me to die again, just stop anyone to ask for help.  

144
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:15,700
â™«  What do I do now     â™«

145
00:14:15,700 --> 00:14:20,560
I won't do it, never. 
  â™«   when my breath is about to stop?   â™«

146
00:14:23,340 --> 00:14:28,690
â™«   I want to hold you, the one whose brightness chills my heart   â™«

147
00:14:28,690 --> 00:14:33,340
  Young Lady Chae Gyeong seemed as if she was determined to die. 

148
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:38,820
â™«   I'm afraid you  might fly away when the wind blows   â™«

149
00:14:38,820 --> 00:14:44,720
â™«  I fill my heart with your smile and tears   â™«

150
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,870
  Still, it's a relief 

151
00:14:47,870 --> 00:14:52,560
  that the person I came to like again is you, Your Highness. 
 â™« I will love only you forever   â™«

152
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:57,000
  I was worried that I had given my heart to some strange man. 

153
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:04,170
â™«  This love which cannot be  hurts so much I can't bear it.   â™«

154
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:12,790
  Chae Gyeong!  Chae Gyeong!   
 â™«    Burying you in my heart even if it kills me is fine   â™«

155
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:21,400
â™«   If I can protect you, I love you.  â™«

156
00:15:24,790 --> 00:15:28,800
â™«    Although I imagine you again and again    â™«

157
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,710
â™«    can't I see you any more ?  â™«

158
00:15:32,710 --> 00:15:35,480
â™«   Although I call your name again and again,   â™«

159
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:39,420
  Don't just laugh. Show your strength. 
 â™«   can I not hear you anymore?   â™« 

160
00:15:39,420 --> 00:15:43,000
The same goes for you. Even if you laugh like that, it's no use. 
 â™«  I will hide this love  â™«

161
00:15:43,000 --> 00:15:46,620
If you refuse my hand, 
 â™«   in a distant faint memory   â™«

162
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:49,490
I won't protect you either.

163
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:56,460
â™«   I want to remember only you forever   â™«

164
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:18,680
Your Majesty!

165
00:16:22,230 --> 00:16:24,520
Assassin! Catch him!

166
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:37,620
  Sin Chae Gyeong is dead at So-eui Gate. 

167
00:16:37,620 --> 00:16:40,350
  Thank you for killing her in my place. 

168
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:50,570
  Dead? Who's dead?! 

169
00:16:50,570 --> 00:16:52,700
  Sin Chae Gyeong is dead. 

170
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:55,440
  Thank you for killing her in my place. 

171
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,630
  Race faster! 

172
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:16,270
  Hurry! Hurry and go! 

173
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:32,760
  You probably thought she wouldn't die.  

174
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:35,970
  You have to know now. 

175
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:41,050
  You have to know what results  from your misinformed decisions and judgment. 

176
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:02,910
 So-eui Gate 

177
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:25,570
  When I'm scared, I whistle like this. 

178
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:28,970
  Then, my heart calms down. 

179
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:23,880
Your Highness the Grand Prince.

180
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:53,490
D-d-don't come, don't come!

181
00:19:54,640 --> 00:19:58,500
No, no, n-no, please...

182
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:03,470
Don't come! Please...

183
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:07,460
Please, don't, no...

184
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:11,260
  Please don't come! Please! 

185
00:20:20,910 --> 00:20:22,740
  Halt! 

186
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:38,040
Chae Gyeong! Sin Chae Gyeong!

187
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,100
Your Majesty...

188
00:20:50,130 --> 00:20:53,360
Chae Gyeong... release her immediately! Hurry!

189
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:55,090
Yes, Your Majesty!

190
00:21:14,680 --> 00:21:19,340
She'll be safe. Isn't that what you expected when you entrusted her to the King?

191
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:38,220
If it was any later, she might have been in danger.

192
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:39,590
What happened?

193
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:41,960
The wound from the poisoned arrow started festering

194
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,600
and the poison spread to her entire body.

195
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:49,490
Her body was not able to withstand the suffering in prison.

196
00:21:49,490 --> 00:21:53,830
She has to live. She must live.

197
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,120
Yes, Your Majesty.

198
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,960
I will first bring the antidote.

199
00:22:06,390 --> 00:22:12,210
Why did you endure until you got into this state? Why?

200
00:22:14,410 --> 00:22:16,550
It's all my fault.

201
00:22:16,550 --> 00:22:21,470
In order to catch the bastard pulling mischief in hiding, I let you fall into this state.

202
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:26,180
So, it would have been better if you told me earlier.

203
00:22:26,180 --> 00:22:29,530
This would have been over if you just said the one phrase, "please help."

204
00:22:43,640 --> 00:22:46,480
Give it here. I will feed it to her.

205
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:49,090
Y-Your Majesty.

206
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:40,200
Your Majesty, this is your guard.

207
00:24:26,670 --> 00:24:28,190
Chae Gyeong.

208
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,800
I am not sorry.

209
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:37,350
Since it's your fault for not keeping the promise.

210
00:24:40,190 --> 00:24:42,950
Didn't you say you wouldn't wait for me?

211
00:24:44,410 --> 00:24:47,030
However, you probably waited.

212
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,620
You probably called my name thousands of times in your head.

213
00:24:54,010 --> 00:24:58,600
Although you told me not to come, you must have waited for me to come.

214
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,880
Do you think I don't know you?

215
00:25:08,010 --> 00:25:09,460
Chae Gyeong.

216
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:20,280
We have searched everywhere from the tavern at the 3-way intersection, the Royal Investigative Bureau, and the palace,

217
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:24,250
but we couldn't find any trace of him. I am sorry, Your Majesty.

218
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,520
Does he want to play hide-and-seek with me now?

219
00:25:49,810 --> 00:25:51,130
Chae Gyeong.

220
00:25:52,740 --> 00:25:54,720
Your Highness.

221
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,940
Why did you have to take it so far?

222
00:25:59,030 --> 00:26:01,260
Did you really try to die?

223
00:26:03,790 --> 00:26:09,970
You did the same thing, Your Highness.

224
00:26:16,830 --> 00:26:18,680
Finally, I am

225
00:26:20,430 --> 00:26:22,910
paying the debt I owe you.

226
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,010
The Queen is here.

227
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,420
Your Majesty, what happened?

228
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:25,380
She must have been wounded when she was helping the thief escape.

229
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,970
Chae Gyeong. Are you alright? Chae Gyeong.

230
00:28:15,290 --> 00:28:17,490
Child.

231
00:28:25,830 --> 00:28:29,540
- How about the Chief Royal Secretary? 
 - I did as you ordered.

232
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,500
Move aside.

233
00:29:41,860 --> 00:29:47,130
Is the position of Chief Royal Secretary beyond your capacity?

234
00:29:48,810 --> 00:29:52,700
I have clearly ordered you to catch a thief,

235
00:29:52,700 --> 00:29:55,120
so why did you let things develop to this extent?

236
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:58,270
Were you that incompetent?

237
00:29:59,150 --> 00:30:02,340
I-I am deeply sorry, Your Majesty.

238
00:30:02,340 --> 00:30:08,520
Come to think of it, the post of Commissioner of Sogyeukseo  (Department of Taoism) ,

239
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:13,620
in which you had nothing to do but to converse with the gods of heaven and earth was the perfect position for you.

240
00:30:13,620 --> 00:30:18,430
This will never happen againâ€”

241
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:20,590
If you ever

242
00:30:22,600 --> 00:30:25,950
hurt one of my people without my order again,

243
00:30:25,950 --> 00:30:28,300
it won't be your back

244
00:30:29,550 --> 00:30:32,370
but your head that you will have to offer to me.

245
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:36,890
I shall heed your words, Your Majesty.

246
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,800
 You're wrong, Your Majesty. 

247
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:03,460
 I must be your only person, Your Majesty. 

248
00:31:03,460 --> 00:31:07,590
 For our sake, by all means, I will capture and bring to you 

249
00:31:07,590 --> 00:31:11,690
 Grand Prince Jin Seong and Sin Soo Geun. 

250
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,310
- Chae Gyeong. 
 - Young Lady.

251
00:31:37,510 --> 00:31:39,120
Mother.

252
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,240
Nanny?

253
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:50,190
What day is it?

254
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,730
What day is it today?

255
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:57,130
Has the 30th passed?

256
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,110
No, it hasn't passed yet.

257
00:31:59,110 --> 00:32:03,150
How do you feel? Do you feel any better?

258
00:32:10,460 --> 00:32:12,020
But,

259
00:32:14,310 --> 00:32:17,740
am I still alive?

260
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,180
Young Lady.

261
00:32:22,230 --> 00:32:25,960
I must not still be alive.

262
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,010
If so, he might come.

263
00:32:30,630 --> 00:32:35,120
Foolish child! How can you talk like that in front of your mother?

264
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:39,020
Die? Who allowed you to die?

265
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,200
Die?

266
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:47,080
It wasn't enough for you to endure with all your energy?

267
00:32:47,080 --> 00:32:51,720
I barely saved you and you're preparing to die again!

268
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:57,510
Fine. Alright, if that is truly your wish, then just die instead.

269
00:32:57,510 --> 00:33:01,640
- My Lady, please calm down.
 - I don't need a daughter like you either.

270
00:33:01,640 --> 00:33:04,360
I don't need a daughter who doesn't care about her parents' shattered hearts

271
00:33:04,360 --> 00:33:09,510
and states that she wants to die just so her guilt can be appeased!

272
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:11,220
I don't need that kind of daughter!

273
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:13,370
- My Lady!
 - Let go of me!

274
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:16,630
My Lady!

275
00:33:19,930 --> 00:33:22,280
Goodness! What should I do?

276
00:33:24,610 --> 00:33:26,650
Is that the herbal tonic?

277
00:33:32,990 --> 00:33:34,650
Enter.

278
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:48,090
I mean, still!

279
00:33:48,090 --> 00:33:51,040
How can you send your mother away like that?

280
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:54,820
He doesn't care whether you die or live.

281
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:57,510
Because of that damned thief who never appeared,

282
00:33:57,510 --> 00:34:01,060
it's alright for you to wreck your relationship with your mother?

283
00:34:02,810 --> 00:34:06,230
He's not coming because he shouldn't come.

284
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:08,960
I even prayed for him not to come,

285
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:13,070
and I promised that I wouldn't wait for him either.

286
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:17,270
By any chance, did you just take that rascal's side?

287
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:21,030
Forget it. Just take your medicine.

288
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:54,400
â™«   You can leave in peace now   â™«

289
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:59,490
â™«   Wake up from the bitter dream and rest   â™«

290
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:05,280
â™«   When time passes, when the seasons pass,   â™«

291
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:10,470
â™«   will the painful memories be erased?   â™«  

292
00:35:10,470 --> 00:35:15,940
â™«   Back then my unfulfilled heart festered  â™«  

293
00:35:15,940 --> 00:35:20,100
No way...

294
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,780
Will you take your medicine while I'm being nice

295
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,330
or do you want to have a go at it? It's been a while.

296
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:32,050
Like this? Or strike you like this?

297
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:34,920
Come on.

298
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:37,600
- I don't want it!
- Come on!

299
00:35:37,600 --> 00:35:43,060
â™«   Don't dwell on past memories  â™«

300
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:48,550
â™«   That once upon a time we were together  â™«

301
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,770
Why are you like this instead of entering?

302
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:57,500
I was just about to enter.

303
00:35:57,500 --> 00:35:59,910
How is she?

304
00:35:59,910 --> 00:36:05,200
Poison has almost been neutralized and she could start eating thin rice gruel for dinner.

305
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:10,000
â™«   If you miss me and you can't forget me  â™«

306
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:13,570
â™«   when the moonlight shines down   â™«

307
00:36:13,570 --> 00:36:17,000
â™«   Remember me.   â™«

308
00:36:25,170 --> 00:36:27,350
Why are you leaving?

309
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:33,020
She just regained her strength but she'll burst into tears when she sees me.

310
00:36:33,020 --> 00:36:36,850
When she cries, her mind will be cluttered and she'll relapse just when she's about to get cured.

311
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:39,510
I'll come back again later.

312
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:46,430
Why are you leaving then?

313
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:50,320
I've already had an argument with her.

314
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:54,860
Goodness, both of your tempers are quite...

315
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:01,850
This isn't the time for mother and daughter to fight.

316
00:37:01,850 --> 00:37:03,420
Yes, I know.

317
00:37:19,850 --> 00:37:22,250
  Happy birthday, Older Brother. I am very happy to have you as my brother. 

318
00:37:22,250 --> 00:37:24,670
  I will be your trustworthy younger brother and protect you. Stay healthy and live long. 

319
00:37:24,670 --> 00:37:27,980
  Sin Chae Gyeong is dead at So-eui gate. 

320
00:37:27,980 --> 00:37:30,670
  Thank you for killing her in my place. 

321
00:37:33,320 --> 00:37:35,760
How ridiculous.

322
00:37:35,760 --> 00:37:40,800
I can't believe I'm using such a cowardly tactic just to catch you.

323
00:37:57,020 --> 00:38:01,540
Fine, come if you will.

324
00:38:01,540 --> 00:38:04,290
I'll gladly greet you.

325
00:38:38,140 --> 00:38:45,560
  Yeok, you're the Grand Prince of this country Joseon. 

326
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:50,400
  That name itself is a precious existence. 

327
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:57,060
  After I die, everyone will come after you. 

328
00:39:22,990 --> 00:39:28,230
Although she has the status of a criminal, she's still the Queen's niece. After hearing that she had fainted,

329
00:39:28,230 --> 00:39:30,450
I couldn't restrain myself from coming.

330
00:39:30,450 --> 00:39:33,190
I'm honored to be receiving your concern.

331
00:39:33,790 --> 00:39:37,700
Your Highness, that's why...

332
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:42,130
I believe you know whom my

333
00:39:42,130 --> 00:39:46,580
daughter's foolishness protected.

334
00:39:47,160 --> 00:39:51,570
I hope that you can now relieve my child of the debt

335
00:39:51,570 --> 00:39:54,540
she incurred towards you in the past.

336
00:39:54,540 --> 00:40:01,550
"There is no more debt between us anymore," that's what you're trying to say, isn't it?

337
00:40:01,550 --> 00:40:07,950
Therefore, I should just stand aside and not do anything this time around as well?

338
00:40:11,220 --> 00:40:13,760
I could help you.

339
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,360
Thank you for the offer,

340
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:20,110
but I will protect my own child.

341
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:23,190
Alright then.

342
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,790
Did you see her?

343
00:40:49,790 --> 00:40:54,800
The First Vice Premier came out strong. He said that there was no more debt between us.

344
00:40:55,530 --> 00:40:59,170
It seems he now knows of His Highness the Grand Prince.

345
00:40:59,170 --> 00:41:02,630
Since I said I would stand aside, just watch them for the time being.

346
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:05,380
There's nothing to take or to give.

347
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:08,730
Let's just watch the First Vice Premier and Young Lady Sin

348
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:10,700
roll along to their fates.

349
00:41:10,700 --> 00:41:12,880
Yes, Your Highness.

350
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:17,850
By the way, what a pity for you. I'm sure you worked up the courage to do it.

351
00:41:18,590 --> 00:41:21,820
How did she endure that deadly poison?

352
00:41:21,820 --> 00:41:26,650
To be truthful, I did not do it.

353
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:33,130
She was already intoxicated by the poison on the arrow,

354
00:41:33,130 --> 00:41:37,790
but she didn't tell anyone and just endured.

355
00:41:37,790 --> 00:41:43,960
Then, are you telling me that wench prepared to die and protected Yeok?!

356
00:41:43,960 --> 00:41:45,490
Yes.

357
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:56,280
Based on Yeok's personality, he'll become more mindful of her because of this incident.

358
00:41:56,280 --> 00:42:00,530
For now, watch to ensure His Highness the Grand Prince does not come forward anymore.

359
00:42:00,530 --> 00:42:04,100
You can deliver the news that Young Lady Sin will be released soon.

360
00:42:04,100 --> 00:42:06,690
Yes, Uncle.

361
00:42:29,560 --> 00:42:30,720
Orabeoni.

362
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:34,890
Oh, you're here. I was just about to search for you.

363
00:42:34,890 --> 00:42:36,750
Is something wrong?

364
00:42:36,750 --> 00:42:38,900
Nothing's wrong. I was just wondering where you had disappeared off to.

365
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:41,580
You're my only source of palace news.

366
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:44,350
- Ah. 
-  Let's go inside.

367
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:53,460
Then, does that mean she will be released?

368
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:56,080
- Not immediately.
- Why not?

369
00:42:56,080 --> 00:43:00,290
Since she was arrested on a royal command, justification is needed to release her.

370
00:43:00,290 --> 00:43:03,470
In a couple of days, the King will announce pardon for her crimes during the Court Session.

371
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:08,000
Wow. It's perfect timing to declare pardon for her crimes.

372
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:11,290
Due to flood damage in the three Southern provinces, court officials brought up the matter of pardoning her crimes

373
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:16,090
and petitions were submitted about it as well.

374
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:19,590
Right, this isn't something that can just be solved with the issue of a clemency order.

375
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:22,770
It's not all because of Young Lady Chae Gyeong,

376
00:43:22,770 --> 00:43:25,070
so won't it be fine?

377
00:43:25,070 --> 00:43:27,100
What are you going to do now?

378
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:35,100
Should I leave the capital for a while?

379
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:40,170
Why are you so shocked?

380
00:43:40,170 --> 00:43:42,190
I am just saying that, since we overcame a crisis,

381
00:43:42,190 --> 00:43:46,210
let's leave for the moment and return when things die down.

382
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,730
What do you think?

383
00:43:57,090 --> 00:43:58,700
Why...

384
00:43:59,610 --> 00:44:02,010
didn't you tell him?

385
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:04,520
That you saw me in the prison cell?

386
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:09,770
How about changing your method?

387
00:44:10,650 --> 00:44:11,530
What?

388
00:44:11,530 --> 00:44:13,720
I heard that love is respecting the ways of your loved one

389
00:44:13,720 --> 00:44:16,920
and becoming alike in your ways of thinking.

390
00:44:17,680 --> 00:44:19,680
That's why love is hard.

391
00:44:19,680 --> 00:44:22,160
Who said I am in love?

392
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:26,560
If it's not love, what is it?

393
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:29,250
Young Lady Chae Gyeong opened up Yeok's heart,

394
00:44:29,250 --> 00:44:32,490
changed his way of thinking, and made him have beliefs.

395
00:44:32,490 --> 00:44:33,910
But, you areâ€”

396
00:44:33,910 --> 00:44:36,300
What about me?

397
00:44:36,300 --> 00:44:41,680
If you wish to beat Young Lady Chae Gyeong, it seems like you must try harder.

398
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:44,910
You, seriously!

399
00:45:15,240 --> 00:45:20,520
â™«  You approached silently  â™«

400
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:29,820
â™«  You smiled at me while offering your hand  â™«

401
00:45:29,820 --> 00:45:36,730
â™«  The time we spent together  â™«

402
00:45:36,730 --> 00:45:42,760
â™«  Is going far away like a dream  â™«

403
00:45:43,930 --> 00:45:46,900
â™«  I can't stand the longing now which is growing so  â™«

404
00:45:46,900 --> 00:45:49,560
  Didn't you say you won't wait for me?  

405
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:52,590
 However, you probably waited. 
â™« Why didn't I know loving would be that?  â™«

406
00:45:52,590 --> 00:45:56,510
  You probably called my name thousands of times in your head. 

407
00:45:56,510 --> 00:46:00,920
 Although you told me not to come, you must have waited for me to come. 

408
00:46:02,140 --> 00:46:05,330
â™«  I can't do anything else but leave
 even though I don't want to go  â™«

409
00:46:05,330 --> 00:46:13,030
â™«  I know now that I can't live without you  â™«

410
00:46:13,030 --> 00:46:16,640
â™«  Don't go away.  I won't be able to see you again.  â™«

411
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:19,840
â™«  So I will be able to see you again.  â™«

412
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:26,610
â™«  I love you once again  â™«

413
00:46:27,860 --> 00:46:33,080
 You said a promise must be made with a token. 

414
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,560
 Then, if that promise becomes invalid, 

415
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:40,940
 isn't it only right to collect the token? 

416
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:47,530
 There are no promises left between us now, 

417
00:46:49,530 --> 00:46:51,930
 including the promise that I will return. 

418
00:46:56,660 --> 00:47:03,470
â™«  Will you wait for me where we first met  â™«

419
00:47:03,470 --> 00:47:11,870
â™«  Will you forgive me who could not go there?  â™«

420
00:47:11,870 --> 00:47:14,810
 There are no promises left between us now. 

421
00:47:14,810 --> 00:47:18,000
â™«  I can't do anything else but leave even though I don't want to go  â™«

422
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:25,700
â™«  I know now that I can't live without you  â™«

423
00:47:25,700 --> 00:47:29,650
â™«  Don't go far away  â™«

424
00:47:29,650 --> 00:47:32,530
â™«  So I will be able to see you again.  â™«

425
00:47:32,530 --> 00:47:39,910
â™«  I love you once again  â™«

426
00:47:39,910 --> 00:47:44,550
â™«  Forever and ever  â™«

427
00:47:46,540 --> 00:47:49,900
â™«  You and me  â™«

428
00:48:13,070 --> 00:48:18,190
Due to the unprecedented flood damage in three southern provinces,

429
00:48:18,190 --> 00:48:21,040
people are greatly suffering.

430
00:48:21,040 --> 00:48:25,220
Perhaps, punishments given were too extreme.

431
00:48:25,220 --> 00:48:29,440
I worry it might have led to feelings of bitterness and unfairness

432
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,660
that resulted in the floods.

433
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:36,520
Thus, all crimes, with the exception of those

434
00:48:36,520 --> 00:48:41,470
related to the safety of the nation such as revolting,

435
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:43,520
whether the verdict for them has been finalized

436
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:47,140
or they are awaiting verdict,

437
00:48:47,140 --> 00:48:50,450
will be forgiven and the offenders released.

438
00:48:50,450 --> 00:48:54,170
This is in order to comfort the bitterness of people on earth,

439
00:48:54,170 --> 00:48:57,540
and to respond to the ways of heaven above.

440
00:48:57,540 --> 00:48:58,890
He's going to pardon her?

441
00:48:58,890 --> 00:49:00,880
He must have read the petitions yesterday.

442
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,730
Thus, Young Lady Sin,

443
00:49:03,730 --> 00:49:06,260
who was being held at the Royal Investigative Bureau

444
00:49:06,260 --> 00:49:10,490
for the crime of helping a criminal escape on the 8th,

445
00:49:12,030 --> 00:49:16,050
will be pardoned for all her crimes.

446
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:20,330
It can't be so, Your Majesty.

447
00:49:20,330 --> 00:49:23,960
Please deliberate on this matter.

448
00:49:25,380 --> 00:49:26,900
What do you mean it can't be so?

449
00:49:26,900 --> 00:49:30,530
There is a precedent for granting amnesty when natural disasters strike.

450
00:49:30,530 --> 00:49:32,590
Why exactly?

451
00:49:32,590 --> 00:49:35,460
Your Majesty, to be honest, last night

452
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:38,530
the thief who stole royal offerings sneaked into my house,

453
00:49:38,530 --> 00:49:40,760
and emptied the repository.

454
00:49:40,760 --> 00:49:44,260
That is so, my house too...

455
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:47,340
My house was robbed too.

456
00:49:47,340 --> 00:49:50,460
Someone stealing from the repository of my house is not a serious matter.  However,

457
00:49:50,460 --> 00:49:54,710
that abominable thief dared to humiliate Your Majesty.

458
00:49:54,710 --> 00:49:58,130
That cannot be forgiven.

459
00:49:58,130 --> 00:50:00,770
Humiliate me?

460
00:50:19,790 --> 00:50:22,200
  There is no need to be bitter. 

461
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:24,510
  Even the king was robbed.  

462
00:50:34,460 --> 00:50:37,650
What exactly happened?

463
00:50:37,700 --> 00:50:39,530
Well,

464
00:50:39,530 --> 00:50:43,420
it seems that last night, the royal offering thief robbed

465
00:50:43,420 --> 00:50:48,320
many of the court officials' houses in Bukcheon, all at the same time.

466
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,470
I will tell the Police Bureau and the Royal Investigative Bureau

467
00:50:50,470 --> 00:50:53,600
to investigate this matter.

468
00:50:57,900 --> 00:50:59,940
Due to this unprecedented matter,

469
00:50:59,940 --> 00:51:04,030
all the senior and junior officials are in disarray.

470
00:51:04,030 --> 00:51:05,810
Thus, Your Majesty,

471
00:51:05,810 --> 00:51:09,530
since Young Lady Sin is the only witness and his accomplice,

472
00:51:09,530 --> 00:51:12,830
you should be prudent in declaring her pardon.

473
00:51:12,830 --> 00:51:14,970
That is so, Your Majesty.

474
00:51:14,970 --> 00:51:16,640
If Young Lady Sin is released,

475
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:20,010
one can never know how active

476
00:51:20,010 --> 00:51:22,430
that thief will be in the future.

477
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:42,730
 There is no need to be bitter. Even the King was robbed. 

478
00:51:44,740 --> 00:51:47,530
  You're gravely mistaken 

479
00:51:47,530 --> 00:51:50,090
 if you thought this would be over just like that. 

480
00:51:54,900 --> 00:51:57,170
 - You must hurry.
 - Yes. 

481
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:58,250
Your Majesty, your subject First Vice Premier Sin Soo Geun,

482
00:52:58,250 --> 00:53:01,980
asks to be held accountable for this incident and thereby requests that you accept my resignation.

483
00:53:01,980 --> 00:53:05,460
Please grant my request. Also,

484
00:53:05,460 --> 00:53:10,500
there is no concrete evidence to show that my daughter is the thief's accomplice,

485
00:53:10,500 --> 00:53:13,470
although it is true she was captured after being with him.

486
00:53:13,470 --> 00:53:15,510
Regarding that matter,

487
00:53:15,510 --> 00:53:20,200
I will be held responsible and receive punishment on her behalf.

488
00:53:21,430 --> 00:53:28,430
Please allow me to receive punishment on  behalf of my daughter

489
00:53:29,330 --> 00:53:31,960
who is in bed due to illness.

490
00:53:36,070 --> 00:53:38,080
I will not grant it.

491
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:41,100
Your Majesty.

492
00:53:41,100 --> 00:53:43,710
I will never grant it.

493
00:53:47,560 --> 00:53:51,690
Did you say you want to catch that thief?

494
00:53:52,300 --> 00:53:55,470
He must be caught?

495
00:53:55,470 --> 00:53:59,330
Thus, the only witness and accomplice Young Lady Sin

496
00:53:59,330 --> 00:54:00,910
must not be released?

497
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:04,190
That is so, Your Majesty.

498
00:54:04,190 --> 00:54:05,640
The reason for this

499
00:54:05,640 --> 00:54:08,570
is not because of the items stolen from you,

500
00:54:08,570 --> 00:54:11,200
but because he dared to humiliate me.

501
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,600
You're advising me out of your loyalty towards me.

502
00:54:13,600 --> 00:54:17,320
Please deliberate on this matter.

503
00:54:17,320 --> 00:54:18,920
Fine.

504
00:54:18,920 --> 00:54:20,090
He needs to be caught.

505
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,000
Of course, he needs to be caught.

506
00:54:28,730 --> 00:54:33,130
Here, all of you take them and use them.

507
00:54:34,910 --> 00:54:39,930
With this one Command Badge,  you can use the government troops to your delight as well.

508
00:54:39,930 --> 00:54:42,620
Since this is the badge of my royal command.

509
00:54:42,620 --> 00:54:45,060
Your Majesty.

510
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:49,530
Make haste and take these, to go capture that thief!

511
00:54:49,530 --> 00:54:52,290
May you rescind your royal order.

512
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:56,960
Your Majesty, you mustn't give out the Command Badge so easily.

513
00:54:56,960 --> 00:54:58,690
Why not?

514
00:54:59,870 --> 00:55:04,780
Because if you take this out and things go awry, you might get your heads chopped off?

515
00:55:04,780 --> 00:55:07,930
Is that the fear now that's keeping you from taking them?

516
00:55:07,930 --> 00:55:11,030
Hurry and take these with you, I said.

517
00:55:19,830 --> 00:55:22,910
Get up, First Vice Premier.

518
00:55:22,910 --> 00:55:24,420
Your Majesty.

519
00:55:24,420 --> 00:55:28,020
Let's go, First Vice Premier.

520
00:55:29,010 --> 00:55:31,070
Your grace is immeasurable, Your Majesty.

521
00:55:31,070 --> 00:55:36,480
However, this matter requires someone to take up the responsibility.

522
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:41,760
But why should you take on that responsibility? Why you, of all people, First Vice Premier?

523
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:44,440
Hasn't that child Chae Gyeong been punished plenty for it already?

524
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,820
For all our efforts, this case remains unsolved.

525
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:52,200
Hence I believe someone needs to take the responsibility and pay for it.

526
00:55:52,200 --> 00:55:58,990
Responsibility? The one to pay should be that hiding coward of a thief who stole the offerings.

527
00:55:58,990 --> 00:56:01,790
As though laying his hands on my offerings was not enough,

528
00:56:01,790 --> 00:56:06,800
he threatened Chae Gyeong and he even ransacked your high ministers' repositories to trifle with me!

529
00:56:06,800 --> 00:56:11,090
That thief! That bastard should be responsible!

530
00:56:13,180 --> 00:56:17,710
Upon hearing news of the First Vice Premier's daughter being arrested...

531
00:56:17,710 --> 00:56:23,770
You all didn't dare to breathe a word, trying not to offend me nor the First Vice Premier.

532
00:56:24,680 --> 00:56:29,440
But when your own repositories were ransacked, now you come showing yourselves.

533
00:56:30,660 --> 00:56:34,000
To think that I consult people like you for state affairs.

534
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,330
Isn't that a lamentable deed?

535
00:56:37,330 --> 00:56:40,540
Those who sought to blame it on the First Vice Premier and his daughter,

536
00:56:40,540 --> 00:56:44,350
must go personally to fetch me the evidence, or that thief's head.

537
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,210
It's after that

538
00:56:46,210 --> 00:56:51,730
can we discuss punishment upon the First Vice Premier or that daughter of his.

539
00:57:27,670 --> 00:57:32,190
In my opinion, you'll probably lose once again.

540
00:57:32,190 --> 00:57:36,420
People don't say "the King upon First Vice Premier" for no reason.

541
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:41,310
But there's an even more interesting rumor going around these days.

542
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:45,930
"No matter how tall a mountain, it is still under the sky." Well, that's not the one.

543
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:52,160
"No matter how high his power, Chief Royal Secretary is still under First Vice Premier."

544
00:57:55,560 --> 00:58:01,780
That's all great, but I don't believe that's something you ought to say, Deputy Commander.

545
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:05,690
At least I have agitated the First Vice Premier.

546
00:58:05,690 --> 00:58:11,330
You can't even step on the First Vice Premier's shadow, right?

547
00:58:13,530 --> 00:58:17,860
I believe this isn't the time for such vulgar blathering.

548
00:58:25,070 --> 00:58:29,050
Since I said I would stand aside, just watch them for the time being.

549
00:58:39,950 --> 00:58:45,550
Is mother very angry? Do you think she won't come here today either?

550
00:58:48,250 --> 00:58:52,420
Nanny. Nanny!

551
00:58:52,420 --> 00:58:55,270
What? Nothing is the matter.

552
00:58:56,600 --> 00:58:58,680
What's going on?

553
00:59:00,210 --> 00:59:02,560
Young Lady...

554
00:59:05,870 --> 00:59:12,280
 Father. Father. Father. 

555
00:59:12,280 --> 00:59:14,290
 Father. 

556
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,560
Shouldn't we try to defend him?

557
00:59:30,560 --> 00:59:35,020
The First Vice Premier sent someone to deliver a handwritten note.

558
00:59:35,020 --> 00:59:38,590
No matter what happens, don't defend him regarding this matter.

559
00:59:55,460 --> 01:00:00,630
Since the thief hasn't been caught yet, we can't ask for the release of Young Lady Sin just because he's doing this.

560
01:00:00,630 --> 01:00:02,690
Don't you agree, Chief Royal Secretary?

561
01:00:02,690 --> 01:00:05,750
Today is the 30th.

562
01:00:05,750 --> 01:00:10,790
There is still some time left until the Hour of the Rooster  (5 - 7 PM) . Let's wait a little more.

563
01:00:10,790 --> 01:00:13,900
Young Lady Sin or the thief.

564
01:00:13,900 --> 01:00:19,700
Since the promise has been made, one of them will have to give up their life.

565
01:00:30,790 --> 01:00:32,690
Father.

566
01:00:36,470 --> 01:00:40,310
Chae Gyeong. Chae Gyeong!

567
01:00:40,310 --> 01:00:42,360
Father!

568
01:00:43,700 --> 01:00:46,190
Chae Gyeong!

569
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:53,360
Father. I am ... I am to blame.

570
01:00:54,450 --> 01:00:58,160
To make even you suffer like this...

571
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,900
Chae Gyeong.

572
01:01:24,880 --> 01:01:29,160
Your Majesty, my family has not committed any crime.

573
01:01:29,160 --> 01:01:31,860
If someone needs to be punished, I will take the punishment.

574
01:01:31,860 --> 01:01:33,670
You can't, Chae Gyeong.

575
01:01:33,670 --> 01:01:37,720
Please deliberate on this matter.

576
01:01:46,060 --> 01:01:51,790
Your Majesty, you should not demean the authority of royal command for my sake.

577
01:01:51,790 --> 01:01:56,540
Please proceed with the punishment as planned.

578
01:01:56,540 --> 01:01:57,810
Chae Gyeong.

579
01:01:57,810 --> 01:02:01,960
The punishment of a ruler should be fair to everyone.

580
01:02:01,960 --> 01:02:08,080
You tried hard to spare me and gave me a chance, Your Majesty.

581
01:02:08,080 --> 01:02:11,000
It was I that have forsaken your intention and the chance given by you.

582
01:02:11,000 --> 01:02:16,050
Thus, please punish me.

583
01:02:19,990 --> 01:02:24,710
What are you doing? Take her to the Royal Hospital.

584
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:30,620
Your Majesty, Your Majesty!

585
01:02:38,290 --> 01:02:40,370
- Chae Gyeong! 
 - Chae Gyeong!

586
01:02:41,650 --> 01:02:43,770
Halt!

587
01:03:22,070 --> 01:03:24,010
Who are you?

588
01:03:32,220 --> 01:03:34,410
I asked who you are.

589
01:03:35,850 --> 01:03:37,700
Lee Yeok.

590
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:52,180
Hyungnim. It's me.

591
01:03:53,690 --> 01:03:56,160
I am back.
