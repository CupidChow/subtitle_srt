1
00:00:46,030 --> 00:00:48,370
Is this what you wanted?

2
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:54,310
If you don't want to regret it, let go of this hand.

3
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:59,640
Regret is something humans do. Ghosts don't regret.

4
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,180
What is it? What's going on?

5
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,370
What is it? What is it?

6
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:51,300
Episode 6

7
00:02:09,090 --> 00:02:16,160
Dirty bastard, wanton bastard. Yes, a bastard like you can't be the Grand Prince. No way.

8
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:17,780
What's up with you?

9
00:02:18,750 --> 00:02:21,070
Father.

10
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,370
You were busy running away when I tried to teach you when you were little. What led you to pick up the sword?

11
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,440
While living, I realized this is necessary.

12
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:34,060
Please teach me.

13
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:03,930
Go easy. Did something happen today?

14
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,250
Nothing happened. Nothing.

15
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:11,530
Then why do you look like him?

16
00:03:11,530 --> 00:03:14,050
Of all people, why do you look like him?

17
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:18,040
Who exactly are you?

18
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:21,800
♫ Wake up from your dream ♫

19
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:26,880
♫ When time passes, as the seasons change ♫

20
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:32,450
♫ You'll even forget the painful memories  ♫

21
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:35,480
Why do you keep catching my eye?

22
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:39,200
Why do you keep making my heart pound?

23
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:42,250
♫ My heart is tinged with the color red ♫

24
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:48,480
♫ Just think that it's soaked with the glow of the sunset ♫

25
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,890
♫ It's alright, leave in peace ♫

26
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:59,130
♫ Don't look back, don't worry ♫

27
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:04,720
♫ Don't remember a single cherished memory ♫

28
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,000
You haven't gone to sleep yet?

29
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,200
I ended up doing something I shouldn't have done.

30
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:13,030
♫ I alone will remember ♫

31
00:04:13,030 --> 00:04:15,180
Useless feelings have resurfaced for me.

32
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:20,520
♫ I long for you, I long for you, if you can't forget me ♫

33
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:27,880
♫ When the moon shines down, remember me ♫

34
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:34,590
♫ Just sometimes ♫

35
00:04:48,660 --> 00:04:51,550
Mother, how long have you been here?

36
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:56,970
Before, you said the same phrase seventeen times in your sleep.

37
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:02,790
What did I say?

38
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:05,070
He can't not be.

39
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:10,550
It must be. It must be. It must be.

40
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:16,000
How did you know?

41
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,380
What?

42
00:05:18,710 --> 00:05:20,850
That you'll get spanked (sounds the same as "it must be").

43
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:26,380
This girl, will you continue to be like this?

44
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,410
Mother.

45
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:31,990
You need to be married soon, but you are always out late.

46
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:35,920
This won't do. Hurry and get dressed.

47
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:40,520
I must meet the Queen today and wrap up the marriage talk from before.

48
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,570
I can't.

49
00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:43,470
- I can't either.
- You really can't.

50
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:46,570
Oh, I really can't either.

51
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,290
Then, give me four, no three, only two days.

52
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:56,510
First, I must mentally prepare myself. After, I will either
meet with a prospective marriage partner or get married.

53
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:01,310
Mother. Mother, just two days please.

54
00:06:01,310 --> 00:06:04,690
There is something I must take care of.

55
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,920
You can not, Your Majesty. Even though the three southern provinces suffered from flood,

56
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:20,090
the areas around the Capital, Gyeonggi, Yeoju, and Icheon have been suffering

57
00:06:20,090 --> 00:06:23,310
from drought for many years already.
[Park Won Jong, Capital Defense Assistant Commander, 2nd Junior Rank]

58
00:06:24,710 --> 00:06:27,720
All the regions are suffering the same hardship,
[Yoo Soon Jeong, Minister of Defense, Senior 2nd Rank]

59
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:31,280
and you can not only give out special favors for selected regions.

60
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,660
That is right, Your Majesty.

61
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:37,490
To deploy the Royal Inspector to three southern provinces to carry out aid,
[Seong Hee An, Deputy Minister of Personnel and Capital Defense Commander, 2nd Senior Rank]

62
00:06:37,490 --> 00:06:41,030
I would have to use the annual budget of the Ministry of General Affairs and Personnel.

63
00:06:44,040 --> 00:06:46,430
Because farmland belonging to you is all located in Gyeonggi-do,

64
00:06:46,430 --> 00:06:49,840
it doesn't matter if land in Gyeongsang-do is submerged in water?

65
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,720
Vice Minister,

66
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,030
to keep your ministry operating,

67
00:06:56,030 --> 00:07:00,150
you are willing to ignore the people of three southern provinces.

68
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,790
How is that whenever I want to do something, it never goes through the first time?

69
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,450
Are you not able to do anything other than opposing for the sake of opposing?

70
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:11,160
Please deliberate on this matter.

71
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:21,700
As officials of the country, they only practice arguing with the king.

72
00:07:21,700 --> 00:07:27,980
They argue among themselves, but as soon as I say something they all respond by "Please deliberate on this matter" in unison.

73
00:07:47,580 --> 00:07:52,350
Now is not the time to tell him about the royal offering.

74
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:56,910
Were you able to catch those pirates?

75
00:07:56,910 --> 00:08:00,820
I have something to say regarding this.

76
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:05,210
Let's meet in Seonwonjeon shortly.
[Seonwonjeon: temple where the deceased king's portrait is displayed]

77
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:20,460
Where is the owner? Owner?

78
00:08:54,100 --> 00:08:56,040
Look here, ghost!

79
00:09:09,670 --> 00:09:12,810
What? Yesterday wasn't enough?

80
00:09:13,960 --> 00:09:17,720
Yes, it wasn't enough. I must know properly.

81
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:21,310
Am I that charming?

82
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:26,670
Enough for a maiden from a distinguished family to throw herself at me with no shame?

83
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:31,630
Yes, you're attractive.

84
00:09:31,630 --> 00:09:36,610
With good looks, a nice voice, and a nice gaze too. Like my Grand Prince.

85
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,090
You're the Grand Prince, aren't you? I am right, aren't I?

86
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:51,120
By chance, did you get hurt somewhere? So you lost your memory?

87
00:09:52,260 --> 00:09:53,910
Nonsense.

88
00:09:55,230 --> 00:09:58,930
If you really are not, prove it.

89
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:02,290
Try to convince me with everything you have.

90
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,940
You should try with everything you have.

91
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:14,900
What you need to do, if a woman wants a response from a man.

92
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,870
Go and learn. Do you think you'll be able to win me with just this?

93
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,440
Why did you come here out of the blue?

94
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:57,140
When I first saw the portrait of this pirate bastard,

95
00:10:57,140 --> 00:11:00,110
he somehow looked familiar.
[Im Sa Hong, Chief Royal Secretary, Senior 3rd Rank]

96
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:07,860
I've never seen him before, but why does he seem familiar?

97
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,770
Then I realized he and

98
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:18,720
the late king really look alike.

99
00:11:24,330 --> 00:11:28,760
If my guess is correct,

100
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:38,070
it explains the hide-and-seek with this bastard.

101
00:11:38,070 --> 00:11:44,480
No way. No way, Lord. He surely died.

102
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,190
We saw the corpse that was transported to the palace.

103
00:11:47,190 --> 00:11:50,960
The face of the corpse was smashed.

104
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:55,760
That was since he was stabbed and pushed from a cliff...

105
00:11:55,760 --> 00:11:58,300
How can he survive that?

106
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,250
If the Grand Prince Jin Seong is alive,

107
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:18,320
we will die, Lord.

108
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,340
If he survived,

109
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:25,540
we just need to kill him again.

110
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,090
How many are there?

111
00:12:39,090 --> 00:12:43,200
There are very many. Roughly estimating, there are more than thirty.

112
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,410
It's the same at Mapo and Yanghwajin as well.

113
00:12:46,410 --> 00:12:48,360
All the docks are being watched.

114
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:51,470
However, thankfully, they are not openly searching.

115
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:56,420
I thought they would have told the King to have the Royal Guards and police everywhere.

116
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:59,710
It's because the King is behaving strangely all of a sudden.

117
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:05,840
The King has suddenly ordered to deploy Royal Inspectors to the three southern provinces for relief.
[Yoon Myeong Hye: Park Won Jong's niece]

118
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:10,600
Why is the King extending good deeds suddenly?

119
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,740
Do you have any guesses?

120
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:17,610
I guess he suddenly wanted to play the good and wise king.

121
00:13:31,610 --> 00:13:34,420
Now, don't be shy and tell me honestly.

122
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:38,130
I have a concubine, but she's not very good at grooming herself.

123
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:41,370
So I would like to teach her.

124
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:46,010
Oh my, how kind. If that's the case...

125
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:51,220
Originally mung bean and adzuki bean were ground up and used for face powder,

126
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:55,140
but it was white and not natural looking.

127
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:56,660
That's right. So then?

128
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,900
If you add a little bit of powder made from dried safflower petals,

129
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,440
it gives a rosy hue and makes the face look attractive like mine.

130
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,660
Safflower powder?

131
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:14,740
This is a wing shaped skirt. All the guys die for it,

132
00:14:14,740 --> 00:14:20,650
so even the madams from noble families are copying it.

133
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:24,360
Take a look at my hair. It's spiraled hair.

134
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,630
This hairstyle is the trend these days.

135
00:14:27,630 --> 00:14:29,190
Can I touch it just once?

136
00:14:29,190 --> 00:14:31,570
Of course.

137
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:35,770
My hair too.

138
00:14:35,770 --> 00:14:40,770
I see. What is that hair pin?

139
00:14:42,460 --> 00:14:44,070
Oh boy.

140
00:14:44,070 --> 00:14:45,820
Oh boy?

141
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:48,400
Oh my.

142
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,670
Oh my?

143
00:14:51,430 --> 00:14:55,710
Oh my. Isn't this Lord Lee?

144
00:14:56,630 --> 00:14:59,390
When did I become a lord?

145
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:03,940
Well, don't just stand there. Come and have a seat here.

146
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:09,270
I thought you would be busy with government work. You're here to have fun again?

147
00:15:09,270 --> 00:15:14,420
What do you take me for? I am here to work today.

148
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:17,240
At a gisaeng house?

149
00:15:43,270 --> 00:15:47,300
Your drawing skills are extraordinary.

150
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:51,400
You're drawing a Chinese rose?

151
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:55,210
Then, I will...

152
00:16:02,330 --> 00:16:04,700
This is black and white drawing.

153
00:16:06,270 --> 00:16:09,060
But this is also a drawing of Chinese roses.

154
00:16:09,060 --> 00:16:11,060
That's not it...

155
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,470
Didn't you say it's a black-and-white drawing?

156
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:32,670
Didn't you say it's a drawing of Chinese roses?

157
00:16:53,430 --> 00:16:58,630
Because the king sent rice to the three southern provinces, we need to only focus on the capital and Gyeonggi area.

158
00:16:58,630 --> 00:17:03,580
The King has suddenly deployed Royal Inspectors to the three southern provinces.

159
00:17:03,580 --> 00:17:05,370
The area where help is most needed is

160
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:09,180
Yeonhwabang, Hoyeonbang, and Jungseonbang.

161
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:11,090
That's over 100 households.

162
00:17:11,090 --> 00:17:13,600
Why are there so many?

163
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:16,810
Do we have enough snail shells?

164
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:19,340
We can't only leave behind rice.

165
00:17:19,340 --> 00:17:22,030
We need to leave snail shells with it. That way people will know

166
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:27,270
the snail bride stopped by and be grateful.
[The snail bride did chores while the husband was away and was gone once the husband came home.]

167
00:17:27,270 --> 00:17:34,070
Those people would be a great help when Yeok sits on the throne later.

168
00:17:34,070 --> 00:17:35,960
Isn't that right, Yeok?

169
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,730
You could become a good and wise king.

170
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:42,410
A good and wise king?

171
00:17:42,410 --> 00:17:45,030
If you become a good and wise king,

172
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:50,360
you will be confident in front of the late king's tomb.

173
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:55,500
The late Grand Prince will also be proud of Your Majesty.

174
00:17:56,740 --> 00:18:00,200
He really wants to become a good and wise king because of that?

175
00:18:05,540 --> 00:18:09,570
Please open the storage. I brought rice from my merchant group.

176
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,150
Young Master Nak Cheon, we need to get going.

177
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:28,870
Yeah, yeah. Let's go.

178
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:50,870
♫ If I told you that I love you, ♫

179
00:18:50,870 --> 00:18:55,540
♫ Would you tell me that you love me too? ♫

180
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:59,600
♫ Baby, would you? ♫

181
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:02,570
♫ If tomorrow I blew you a kiss, ♫

182
00:19:02,570 --> 00:19:06,990
♫ Would you say please give me some more of this? ♫

183
00:19:06,990 --> 00:19:11,200
Is this good enough?
♫ Would you? ♫

184
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,260
♫ Every day when I open my eyes, ♫

185
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:19,270
♫ It is you that I see in my mind. ♫

186
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:21,230
♫ It's you. ♫

187
00:19:22,220 --> 00:19:24,670
♫ But I know that you'll never love me the way ♫

188
00:19:24,670 --> 00:19:27,310
♫ that I love you baby, baby

189
00:19:27,310 --> 00:19:29,140
Did you drink?

190
00:19:29,140 --> 00:19:33,030
No, no. Not liquor but medicine.

191
00:19:33,030 --> 00:19:38,440
A medicine that makes embarrassment, shyness, and other things disappear.

192
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:40,170
♫ You are the light in my eyes ♫

193
00:19:40,170 --> 00:19:42,740
What on earth do you want?

194
00:19:42,740 --> 00:19:45,770
You need to go somewhere with me.

195
00:19:45,770 --> 00:19:48,060
Take care of it here.

196
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:51,200
♫ But I know that you'll never love me the way that I love you baby, baby ♫

197
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:55,920
♫ No matter how hard I try ♫

198
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,210
Even if I do this?

199
00:19:57,210 --> 00:20:02,930
♫ But I know that you'll never love me the way that I love you baby, baby ♫

200
00:20:02,930 --> 00:20:09,110
♫ No matter how hard I try ♫

201
00:20:17,310 --> 00:20:20,350
Hey, you intend to go out now? In this broad daylight?

202
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,840
If you keep getting involved with that maiden, running into the king is only a matter of time.

203
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:25,970
Didn't you say she's very close to the king?

204
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:29,650
From when she was young, once she sets her mind on something, there is no going back.

205
00:20:29,650 --> 00:20:31,980
She won't be turned away by a few words.

206
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,580
So you're saying we need to take special measures?

207
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:35,970
Do you have a way?

208
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:40,600
First, I will have to do everything she asks ... then ...

209
00:20:40,630 --> 00:20:44,440
There is only one way to get rid of a woman for good.

210
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,610
To make her sick and tired of you.

211
00:21:14,670 --> 00:21:18,780
Now then, do as you wish.

212
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:23,760
I will be yours for today.

213
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,810
Oh my!

214
00:22:05,480 --> 00:22:07,890
What's going on?

215
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,900
- What are you doing?
- A good deed.

216
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,560
Look here.

217
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:40,870
You look presentable now.

218
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:18,010
Be careful when you're putting stolen goods on the market.

219
00:23:18,010 --> 00:23:22,470
Probably, Im Sa Hong's people would have bought off most of the merchants dealing with stolen goods.

220
00:23:22,470 --> 00:23:26,520
In 10 days, my merchant group is leaving for Ming (China) with the envoy.

221
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,540
I will sell the stolen goods in Ming.

222
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,460
Where is Orabeoni Nak Cheon?

223
00:23:35,860 --> 00:23:41,930
Young Master Jo, should we make a bet on who will move the rice faster?

224
00:23:41,930 --> 00:23:46,090
That's good, good. I bet one nyang on my win.

225
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:47,730
I am betting two nyang on my victory.

226
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:52,670
You two, it's more helpful if you just stay still.

227
00:23:54,710 --> 00:24:01,650
Oh, you're right. Hurry. We don't have time.

228
00:24:01,650 --> 00:24:08,100
Think carefully. It's just that you don't remember. Do you remember this place?

229
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:15,130
That time, me, you, and Seo No. The three of us

230
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:20,090
sat like this and made an oath to be friends. Don't you remember?

231
00:24:20,090 --> 00:24:25,910
We sat in a row and made an oath with our hands raised.

232
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:27,530
Aren't you going to do it?

233
00:24:29,470 --> 00:24:32,100
I swear, to the Heavens

234
00:24:32,100 --> 00:24:36,900
without a trace of shame, I will become a sincere friend.

235
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:41,270
When I asked to be friends, you were eager to become one right away.

236
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:45,830
I couldn't help it because you nagged so much.

237
00:24:48,020 --> 00:24:52,640
Well, for the next stop, I know this amazing place.

238
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,550
How about here?

239
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,540
You crossed here carrying me on your back.

240
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:27,350
But you were intentionally stumbling saying I was heavy. So I hit your back.

241
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,760
It was the back of my head.

242
00:25:42,800 --> 00:25:45,640
We can get married.

243
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:50,890
But it won't be a political marriage. I am doing this marriage because I like you.

244
00:25:50,890 --> 00:25:56,210
I received a proposal here.

245
00:25:56,210 --> 00:26:02,560
He told me let's live like friends and have fun forever after getting married.

246
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:24,800
What, what are you doing now?

247
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:26,780
- It's not there.
- What?

248
00:26:31,310 --> 00:26:32,940
What are you doing now?

249
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:36,180
You could have it on as a necklace, the ring.

250
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:41,190
The ring that I gave you. The ring that I gave as a promise to wait.

251
00:26:42,770 --> 00:26:48,360
♫ You don't have to speak ♫

252
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:53,090
Look, will this do?

253
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:57,870
♫ The sight of you smiling so brightly was blinding ♫

254
00:26:57,870 --> 00:27:01,640
♫ The sight of you smiling so brightly was blinding ♫

255
00:27:04,360 --> 00:27:06,460
If I am not the Grand Prince Jin Seong,

256
00:27:06,460 --> 00:27:08,960
♫ Because you came a step closer ♫

257
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,760
it won't do?

258
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:15,070
♫ My heart is pounding ♫

259
00:27:16,370 --> 00:27:19,930
♫ You, who shine so brightly, who are you?  ♫

260
00:27:19,930 --> 00:27:23,990
♫ My breath stops ♫

261
00:27:26,370 --> 00:27:33,340
♫ I'm staring at you whom I've imagined in my dreams ♫

262
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:37,670
♫ A flower blooms in my heart ♫

263
00:27:37,670 --> 00:27:41,400
If I am not the Grand Prince Jin Seong, it won't do?

264
00:27:41,400 --> 00:27:44,460
♫ Unconsciously, I keep smiling ♫

265
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:50,640
♫ Love calls so we ride the clouds ♫

266
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:32,310
I took to heart your criticism from last time.

267
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:39,100
Especially your esteemed opinion about managing the budget, which was quite impressive.

268
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:46,970
Thus this time, I decided to demonstrate my sincerity to you.

269
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:54,410
His Majesty personally painted these late into the night so he could bestow them to the ministers.

270
00:28:54,410 --> 00:28:59,400
With the money from these paintings' sales, I would like to set up a Relief Office to provide aid to the people.

271
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:05,800
So I hope you could give a good price for these paintings.

272
00:29:05,800 --> 00:29:09,890
Your Majesty, how can we put a monetary value on your paintings?

273
00:29:09,890 --> 00:29:11,900
Yes, how dare we?

274
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:18,240
This is a royal command. Please name a price as you wish. I hope it's a good price.

275
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,300
Your subject does not deserve such grace.

276
00:29:21,300 --> 00:29:25,110
Now, now take a look.

277
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:35,800
- I will accept this painting, Your Majesty.
- Thank you.

278
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:40,160
- Your subject does not deserve such grace.
- Your subject does not deserve such grace.

279
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:44,830
Your subject does not deserve such grace.

280
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:46,900
Thank you.

281
00:29:48,930 --> 00:29:50,490
Capital Defense Assistant Commander.

282
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:55,220
By mistake, I put a painting out that belongs to someone else.

283
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,330
It seems this painting means something special to you, Your Majesty.

284
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:04,010
Something special...

285
00:30:05,450 --> 00:30:07,870
I am going to give it as a present. Get it ready.

286
00:30:07,870 --> 00:30:10,110
Yes, Your Majesty.

287
00:30:31,150 --> 00:30:34,200
It's been a while. Your Highness.
[Sin Soo Geun, Prime Minister, Senior First Rank]

288
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:39,530
Since His Majesty is busy these days, unlike the past, you must have also been busy.
[Queen Dowager Ja Soon]

289
00:30:39,530 --> 00:30:45,390
When His Majesty is trying something for the people, it should be welcomed.

290
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:52,760
Then, why is every court official leaving the hall with a gloomy expression on his face?

291
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:57,040
The court officials are people of Joseon too.

292
00:30:57,040 --> 00:31:00,180
By chance, has His Majesty forgotten that fact?

293
00:31:00,180 --> 00:31:06,730
As long as the subjects don't forget that they are people of Joseon and subjects of the King,

294
00:31:06,730 --> 00:31:10,830
His Majesty won't forget that fact either.

295
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:12,960
Is that right?

296
00:31:15,370 --> 00:31:20,000
I am very reassured to have you by His Majesty's side.

297
00:31:40,340 --> 00:31:42,740
Where are you going now?

298
00:31:42,740 --> 00:31:48,270
It's my turn now. It's only fair we go to a place of my wish too.

299
00:31:48,270 --> 00:31:52,570
In order to be fair, shouldn't you try to match my pace?

300
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:10,110
♫ Back then my heart became festered  ♫

301
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:14,770
♫ My heart is tinged with the color red ♫

302
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:21,200
♫ Just think that it is soaked with the glow of the sunset ♫

303
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:26,470

♫ Don't look back, don't worry ♫

305

♫ Don't remember a single cherished memory ♫

306
00:32:36,900 --> 00:32:47,430
♫ Although we once were together, I alone will remember ♫

307
00:32:47,430 --> 00:32:52,810
♫ You, you, my love ♫

308

00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:11,600
♫ Please remember me ♫

312
00:33:14,760 --> 00:33:18,680
♫ Just every so often ♫

313
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:21,030
Didn't you say it's a black-and-white drawing?

314
00:33:21,030 --> 00:33:23,980
Didn't you say it's a drawing of Chinese roses?

315
00:33:25,780 --> 00:33:29,480
It seems this painting means something special to you, Your Majesty.

316
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:31,860
I'm going to gift it to someone. Prepare it.

317
00:33:50,700 --> 00:33:57,100
I heard he was attacked by a group of bandits on his way to being exiled when he was young.

318
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:02,330
Grand Prince Jin Seong's tomb

319
00:34:09,140 --> 00:34:11,380
Thank you!

320
00:34:11,380 --> 00:34:15,930
I should be overflowing with gratitude to spend a day with any noble lady,

321
00:34:15,930 --> 00:34:20,750
but with the precious daughter of the Prime Minister, I had a good time.

322
00:34:22,110 --> 00:34:23,980
What?

323
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:27,840
Are you afraid that he may leap out of his tomb and harm you?

324
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:36,390
I'm sure you've seen everything, but Maiden Chae Gyeong and I have shared our feelings with each other.

325
00:34:36,390 --> 00:34:40,390
Do you think that's all we shared? We shared our body temperatures

326
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,330
and even our breaths.

327
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:52,430
Shouldn't the deceased even be suspicious by now?

328
00:34:52,430 --> 00:34:56,600
Are you doing this because you truly believe I'm Grand Prince Jin Seong

329
00:34:56,600 --> 00:34:59,330
or are you just using Grand Prince Jin Seong as an excuse

330
00:35:00,800 --> 00:35:04,120
to get closer to me?

331
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:04,990
Look here!

332
00:35:04,990 --> 00:35:11,050
Didn't you ever think that even if you met Grand Prince Jin Seong,

333
00:35:11,050 --> 00:35:14,560
pretending you didn't know him would be good, for his sake?

334
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:19,360
More than anything... He's your first love and betrothed,

335
00:35:19,360 --> 00:35:21,910
but will he feel the same?

336
00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:29,480
What's the guarantee he'll want to see you again?

337
00:35:38,190 --> 00:35:44,790
Listen well. My name is Nak Cheon and I already have a woman, so...

338
00:35:44,790 --> 00:35:48,280
if you truly care about Grand Prince Jin Seong,

339
00:35:48,280 --> 00:35:53,150
please don't do things to tarnish his name, such as using him as an excuse

340
00:35:53,150 --> 00:35:55,430
to chase after another man who's not your husband.

341
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:58,100
That's just pitiful for the dead person.

342
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,730
The Grand Prince Jin Seong who liked you no longer exists.

343
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,230
That person is dead.

344
00:36:25,550 --> 00:36:27,810
My name is Nak Cheon

345
00:36:27,810 --> 00:36:32,610
and I already have a woman, so if you truly care about Grand Prince Jin Seong,

346
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:37,070
please don't do things to tarnish his name, such as using him as an excuse

347
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:39,350
to chase after another man who's not your husband.

348
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:10,520
Yeok! Why are you so wet?

349
00:37:10,520 --> 00:37:13,750
- You'll catch a cold.
- You'll be in big trouble if you do!

350
00:37:14,820 --> 00:37:17,790
Then, rest up, Yeok.

351
00:37:31,220 --> 00:37:34,550
- You're late.
- Yes.

352
00:37:36,060 --> 00:37:38,180
What happened?

353
00:37:38,180 --> 00:37:40,390
About what?

354
00:37:40,390 --> 00:37:43,060
I heard everything from Young Master Baek.

355
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:47,330
Then you know everything.

356
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:56,610
That woman... she even came to the pawn shop?

357
00:37:56,610 --> 00:37:58,720
What are you planning to do?

358
00:38:00,830 --> 00:38:03,570
- Orabeoni!
- I'm angry.

359
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,180
I'm furious that while I lived a hellish life,

360
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:12,490
she became close with my brother, out of all people,

361
00:38:13,530 --> 00:38:15,770
so I wanted to torment her.

362
00:38:19,110 --> 00:38:20,820
So,

363
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,070
you spent the entire day with her today

364
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:30,850
and kissed her the previous day?

365
00:38:33,020 --> 00:38:35,840
Orabeoni, why is your revenge so sweet?

366
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:38,480
Let's not waste our energy over nothing.

367
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:03,770
Even if it's nothing,

368
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,690
I must erase it.

369
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,670
Chae Gyeong!

370
00:40:48,570 --> 00:40:50,520
Your Majesty...

371
00:40:54,130 --> 00:40:56,030
Your Majesty!

372
00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:03,910
I don't know what I've just done.

373
00:41:05,970 --> 00:41:09,680
I don't know why I'm acting like this.

374
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,720
How... exactly how...

375
00:41:17,740 --> 00:41:21,280
Get up, your clothes are all wet.

376
00:41:32,790 --> 00:41:36,140
Chae Gyeong! Chae Gyeong!

377
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,260
Chae Gyeong!

378
00:41:40,020 --> 00:41:43,630
Hyungnim, it's me! You must escape.

379
00:41:50,170 --> 00:41:51,020
Hey, you there!

380
00:41:51,020 --> 00:41:55,770
Hyungnim, we must escape! Hyungnim!

381
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:02,400
We need to leave!

382
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,960
Stop right there!

383
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:21,120
Shoot!

384
00:42:23,550 --> 00:42:25,090
Jump!

385
00:42:43,310 --> 00:42:44,320
Chae Gyeong!

386
00:42:44,320 --> 00:42:45,570
Your Highness the Grand Prince!

387
00:42:45,570 --> 00:42:50,430
- Chae Gyeong! Chae Gyeong!
- Your Highness the Grand Prince.

388
00:43:09,110 --> 00:43:11,640
Exactly what happened?

389
00:43:12,790 --> 00:43:17,640
Why did you look like that earlier? What was all that talk about?

390
00:43:18,970 --> 00:43:22,830
I saw someone who resembled His Highness the Grand Prince.

391
00:43:25,110 --> 00:43:27,050
Someone that resembled Yeok?

392
00:43:30,860 --> 00:43:32,810
Exactly who?

393
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:39,290
His name is Nak Cheon.

394
00:43:39,290 --> 00:43:44,900
You caught a glimpse of him a few days ago in the tavern.

395
00:43:49,690 --> 00:43:51,510
What's going on,

396
00:43:52,260 --> 00:43:53,980
wife?

397
00:43:57,950 --> 00:44:03,010
So that was the reason you ran out abruptly.

398
00:44:03,700 --> 00:44:07,760
His eyes, voice, and

399
00:44:07,760 --> 00:44:13,550
even his habits were so similar that I was mistaken.

400
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:18,220
I wanted to prove that he was the Grand Prince, no matter what it took.

401
00:44:18,220 --> 00:44:24,200
So, did you cry so sorrowfully because you realized he was not?

402
00:44:25,980 --> 00:44:31,500
I don't know why I'm crying like this either.

403
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:35,690
I don't know if it's because of the vicious words I heard from him

404
00:44:35,690 --> 00:44:42,650
or if it's because I was shocked that he isn't the Grand Prince.

405
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:44,570
If it's not either of those...

406
00:44:49,980 --> 00:44:52,500
I must have gone insane.

407
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:55,480
I lost my mind.

408
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:00,880
I don't even know if I have the right to cry like this.

409
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:09,230
I feel so apologetic towards His Highness the Grand Prince, Your Majesty.

410
00:45:11,270 --> 00:45:14,770
I feel so sorry about His Highness the Grand Prince, Your Majesty.

411
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,300
You lost him?

412
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,360
Did you just tell me you lost him?

413
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:32,550
I apologize, My Lord, but don't worry.

414
00:45:32,550 --> 00:45:36,790
I've confirmed that he's in the capital so I'll be sure to bring him to you.

415
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:41,550
There's no need to bring him to me. Kill him on the spot!

416
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:48,060
He has to die for you to live.

417
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:51,990
I'll keep that in mind.

418
00:46:13,650 --> 00:46:17,800
Nak Cheon! Exactly what happened?

419
00:46:30,010 --> 00:46:32,160
Why are you so reckless?!

420
00:46:32,160 --> 00:46:34,660
What's the big deal about her that you would chase after her like that?

421
00:46:34,660 --> 00:46:37,240
Orabeoni, you're not in your right state of mind, are you?

422
00:46:37,240 --> 00:46:42,450
Do you really want to die? Do you want to spread rumors of who you are to the entire neighborhood?

423
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:52,210
If you can't cut her out of your life, I'll do it.

424
00:46:52,210 --> 00:46:57,270
Don't ever forget how we came this far.

425
00:47:47,260 --> 00:47:50,960
I saw someone who resembled His Highness the Grand Prince.

426
00:48:33,550 --> 00:48:34,890
Who is it?

427
00:48:34,890 --> 00:48:37,800
Death is too easy.

428
00:48:37,800 --> 00:48:41,530
You'll soon experience a pain greater than death, Brother.

429
00:48:55,730 --> 00:48:59,130
Your Majesty, are you alright?

430
00:49:31,670 --> 00:49:33,450
Look here.

431
00:49:34,390 --> 00:49:36,200
Queen.

432
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:40,810
Royal Mother-in-law, what brings you all the way here?

433
00:49:57,510 --> 00:50:02,300
I came out for a night walk and walked this far without realizing.

434
00:50:05,310 --> 00:50:08,820
It seems you were on your way to deliver the herbal tonic to His Majesty the King.

435
00:50:08,820 --> 00:50:13,700
Yes, it seemed as if he had been caught in the rain after taking a leave from the palace.

436
00:50:13,700 --> 00:50:18,870
It hasn't been long since the rain has stopped and the air is quite chilly.

437
00:50:18,870 --> 00:50:21,780
Please do not walk for too long, Your Highness.

438
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:25,930
You should go.

439
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:26,370
Do you know how startled I was after I heard Myeong Hye's

440
00:51:27,170 --> 00:51:30,650
message that you might have entered the palace?

441
00:51:30,650 --> 00:51:34,720
I apologize for causing concern.

442
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,920
Exactly why did you do something so reckless?

443
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:41,210
You have to patiently endure and wait for the right time.

444
00:51:41,210 --> 00:51:43,650
While waiting for that time,

445
00:51:44,760 --> 00:51:48,050
didn't you lose a son?

446
00:51:53,390 --> 00:51:55,270
I...

447
00:51:57,590 --> 00:52:00,310
I am planning to search for a path that suits me.

448
00:52:00,310 --> 00:52:03,650
I'm on my way back, after confirming

449
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:06,570
that hiding and running away is not my method.

450
00:52:16,430 --> 00:52:18,500
I missed you.

451
00:53:01,050 --> 00:53:03,200
Yeok...

452
00:53:05,620 --> 00:53:07,590
My son...

453
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:12,640
Mother, please wait a bit longer.

454
00:53:12,640 --> 00:53:17,440
I'll return to your side soon.

455
00:53:48,060 --> 00:53:52,610
What do you think? Do you think it resembles him too?

456
00:53:53,420 --> 00:53:56,950
Whom are you speaking of?

457
00:53:57,970 --> 00:54:00,570
Grand Prince Jin Seong.

458
00:54:01,550 --> 00:54:04,090
What was his name again?

459
00:54:04,090 --> 00:54:08,980
Nak Cheon. Yes, she said his name was Nak Cheon.

460
00:54:09,590 --> 00:54:13,660
With a face that resembled my younger brother's, he met Chae Gyeong.

461
00:54:23,300 --> 00:54:26,500
Seungmyeongpae: the card of a vassal who received and was carrying out the king's command

462
00:54:27,450 --> 00:54:30,930
You may use the Royal Guard, Royal Investigative Bureau, the Police Bureau,

463
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:34,210
the royal forces, or soldiers. Whatever is necessary.

464
00:54:34,210 --> 00:54:37,280
I'll find him and dispose of him immediately.

465
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:38,790
No.

466
00:54:40,260 --> 00:54:42,920
Bring him to me.

467
00:54:42,920 --> 00:54:48,440
I must see him with my own two eyes.

468
00:55:11,780 --> 00:55:16,220
How did he already see this face?

469
00:55:16,220 --> 00:55:19,220
This means we must hurry.

470
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,710
Although he authorized the use of men,

471
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:28,080
if we use large scale forces, this news will reach the Queen Dowager.

472
00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:32,120
Then, won't this become even more complicated?

473
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:40,370
We should use the Prime Minister's daughter.

474
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:43,140
Didn't they say the two already met?

475
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:47,840
It seems as if he still has lingering feelings,

476
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:51,550
so he'll fall into the trap.

477
00:56:05,500 --> 00:56:07,390
Grave of Grand Prince Jin Seong

478
00:56:10,710 --> 00:56:15,480
♫  You approached silently  ♫

479
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:21,630
Your Highness, you're very disappointed in me, aren't you?
♫  You smiled at me  ♫

480
00:56:21,630 --> 00:56:24,290
I came here to apologize
♫  while offering your hand  ♫

481
00:56:24,290 --> 00:56:32,280
so please don't be mad.
♫ The time we spent together  ♫

482
00:56:32,280 --> 00:56:38,750
♫  is going far away like a dream  ♫

483
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:46,140
♫  I can't stand the longing now which is growing so  ♫

484
00:56:46,140 --> 00:56:53,100
♫  Why didn't I know loving would be that?  ♫

485
00:56:53,100 --> 00:56:54,100
I'm sorry.

486
00:56:54,100 --> 00:56:57,750
♫  I can't do anything else but leave  ♫

487
00:56:57,750 --> 00:57:00,930
I'm sorry that I confused you with a ridiculous person.
♫ even though I don't want to go  ♫

488
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:06,620
♫  I know now that I can't live without you  ♫

489
00:57:06,620 --> 00:57:10,890
I miss you so much...
♫  Don't go far away  ♫

490
00:57:10,890 --> 00:57:15,560
so, so I must have lost my mind for a moment.
♫  so I can see you  ♫

491
00:57:15,560 --> 00:57:22,360
♫  I love you once again  ♫

492
00:57:23,190 --> 00:57:27,620
I'll warn you all once more. Don't get caught and don't step forward either.

493
00:57:27,620 --> 00:57:32,090
We're not trying to become heroes, we're trying to become hope

494
00:57:32,090 --> 00:57:36,930
that the Heavens have not abandoned the people of Joseon.

495
00:57:36,930 --> 00:57:39,900
There are snail shell brides by the people,

496
00:57:39,900 --> 00:57:42,180
we just need to get this message across.

497
00:57:42,180 --> 00:57:44,110
We'll keep that in mind!

498
00:57:44,110 --> 00:57:45,960
I'm going too.

499
00:57:54,330 --> 00:57:57,910
Hey, you can't!

500
00:57:57,910 --> 00:58:00,980
Then should I hide behind you for my entire life?

501
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:04,340
Is everyone ready?

502
00:58:04,340 --> 00:58:06,370
Yes, sir!

503
00:58:06,370 --> 00:58:08,190
Let's get going.

504
00:58:38,940 --> 00:58:43,540
Monitor every single movement of the Prime Minister's daughter.

505
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:43,800
- What are you doing?!
- The thing is—

506
00:59:43,800 --> 00:59:46,730
Hey, you're a man! What kind of man is afraid of that height? Go over!

507
00:59:46,730 --> 00:59:49,120
Go over! Over!

508
00:59:54,150 --> 00:59:57,420
Catch her! Catch that maiden right now!

509
01:00:06,230 --> 01:00:09,220
Did you forget what happens if you meddle in someone else's affairs?

510
01:00:12,730 --> 01:00:15,380
Y-you...

511
01:00:39,060 --> 01:00:42,490
Did you forget what happens if you meddle in someone else's affairs?

512
01:00:42,490 --> 01:00:47,030
I heard that child was your friend.

513
01:00:48,220 --> 01:00:53,180
What friend? Do you know what I went through because of this girl?

514
01:00:53,180 --> 01:00:56,360
She involved herself in each of my affairs and disturbed me.

515
01:00:56,360 --> 01:01:00,360
Though I shouted at her many times to mind her own business and get lost,

516
01:01:00,360 --> 01:01:03,760
she came on like a leech and complicated things for me.

517
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:05,860
Your Highness.

518
01:01:07,910 --> 01:01:10,660
So I told you to not meddle in my business and get lost!

519
01:01:10,660 --> 01:01:13,690
I told you to never appear in front of me again!

520
01:01:15,930 --> 01:01:18,120
It's something I did alone.

521
01:01:20,000 --> 01:01:24,080
It's something I did. I'll gladly take the punishment.

522
01:01:28,650 --> 01:01:31,730
Why are we running away?

523
01:01:31,730 --> 01:01:34,440
Someone was following us.

524
01:01:34,440 --> 01:01:36,250
What did we do wrong?

525
01:01:36,250 --> 01:01:40,320
Even if we didn't do anything wrong, we could still die.

526
01:01:43,820 --> 01:01:47,530
Why are we running away when we haven't done anything wrong?

527
01:01:47,530 --> 01:01:51,070
- Even if we haven't done anything wrong—
- We can still die?

528
01:02:08,500 --> 01:02:15,050
♫ Without me knowing, my entire world was filled by you ♫

529
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:19,680
♫ Without a sound, without me knowing ♫

530
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:23,760
It is you. I know it's you.

531
01:02:23,760 --> 01:02:27,690
Why are you lying? Why are you denying it?

532
01:02:27,690 --> 01:02:31,620
When it is you? It is you.

533
01:02:31,620 --> 01:02:38,710
♫ What should I do now? My breath is about to stop ♫

534
01:02:42,150 --> 01:02:49,950
♫ As much as my heart aches, I want to embrace you. ♫

535
01:02:49,950 --> 01:02:55,800
♫ I don't want the wind to blow because I might fly away ♫
