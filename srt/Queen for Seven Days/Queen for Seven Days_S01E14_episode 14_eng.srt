1
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:45,950


2
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,030
  She says she came to look for a job. 

3
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:55,130
 Do you really plan to use that girl as a servant? 

4
00:01:04,190 --> 00:01:06,880
  My name is Nak Cheon. I have a woman too. 

5
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,340
 Thus, if you are really thinking about Grand Prince Jin Seong,  

6
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:15,600
  please stop using the name of the deceased in chasing after men. 

7
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,990
  How in the world?  

8
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:20,580
Miss.

9
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,670
Miss. Please allow me to work in this house.

10
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,560
I want to serve you, Miss.

11
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:42,320
  Episode 14  

12
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:49,400
Eunuch Song, is my wife in the annex?

13
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:55,710
Yes. However, the Queen Dowager stopped by a little while ago.

14
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:02,340
Royal Mother stopped by? Why?

15
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,620
I heard she came with the auspicious date for the consummation of marriage.

16
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:11,640
 Who  

17
00:02:13,240 --> 00:02:15,040
 are you? 

18
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:17,770
I can do everything well.

19
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:22,310
 What's your relationship to the Grand Prince? 

20
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,180
 Why did you approach me? 

21
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:31,800
 Is it because of the secret order perhaps? 

22
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:34,190
Alright.

23
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:37,800
Thank you. Thank you, Miss.

24
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,110
Chae Gyeong.

25
00:03:03,290 --> 00:03:05,840
I greet Your Highness, the Grand Prince.

26
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,060
She will wait on me from today.

27
00:03:40,030 --> 00:03:42,520
I give my greetings.

28
00:03:43,340 --> 00:03:46,430
I am Jjong Ah.

29
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,830
Where are you going?

30
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:20,010
Grand Prince. Your Highness, the Grand Prince.

31
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:22,500
A place where my mind can be at ease.

32
00:04:25,130 --> 00:04:27,160
It hurts.

33
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,620
Sorry.

34
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:38,900
I am sorry.

35
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:50,300
I thought deeply about what you said last time, First Vice Premier.

36
00:04:50,300 --> 00:04:55,580
I had overlooked the fate of the two kids which the late king had given his blessing to.

37
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:03,720
Thus, like you said, I will truly wish for their happiness from now.

38
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:07,070
That's a great idea.

39
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:12,530
Thus, I went to their private residence today and selected the date for consummation of their marriage.

40
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:19,860
If a grandchild is born, those two will be inseparable.

41
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:24,070
If something happens to one, both will suffer.

42
00:05:24,070 --> 00:05:31,630
Thus, in every decision in their life, they will need to help each other first of all.

43
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:36,400
Yes. More than anything,

44
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:42,130
they shouldn't behave in a way to cause harm to each other.

45
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:50,390
Although there won't be anyone who will commit a wrongdoing knowing it will cause harm to the family.

46
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:04,720
Go in.

47
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:11,470
Why should I? Now, I am an outsider to my family, I will go back to my home.

48
00:06:11,470 --> 00:06:16,490
Please, stay here for today. I'll be busy today since I have to take care of some things.

49
00:06:16,490 --> 00:06:20,630
Since the wedding, you have never seen your parents.

50
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:23,590
Are you worrying about me now?

51
00:06:24,540 --> 00:06:29,170
No. I am worrying about myself.

52
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:32,360
My mind will be more at ease if you are here.

53
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:55,570
Chae Gyeong!

54
00:06:56,570 --> 00:07:00,930
Hey, girl. What brings you here?

55
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:03,840
What do you mean what brings me here? Am I not allowed to come here?

56
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:09,100
Oh, right. It's good that you came. Oh my.

57
00:07:13,320 --> 00:07:18,250
 She will serve me from today. 

58
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:21,010
 I greet Your Highness, the Grand Prince. 

59
00:07:31,530 --> 00:07:35,030
So whose turn was it to die yesterday?

60
00:07:35,030 --> 00:07:37,510
I haven't received reports yet.

61
00:07:37,510 --> 00:07:39,830
It will be difficult for you to get the report.

62
00:07:39,830 --> 00:07:45,970
With the smallest mistake, the person reporting and the person receiving the report will have their heads cut off.

63
00:07:46,910 --> 00:07:50,700
His Majesty enters!

64
00:07:51,510 --> 00:07:55,060
We greet you, Your Majesty.

65
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:01,700
I will only momentarily give out a reward today.

66
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:04,990
I am not feeling well.

67
00:08:04,990 --> 00:08:07,160
Minister of Personnel (2nd Senior Rank).

68
00:08:07,160 --> 00:08:11,230
Yes, Your Majesty. Please give your order.

69
00:08:11,230 --> 00:08:17,200
I read the poem you wrote about how you felt about my night hunting.

70
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:19,890
It was very impressive.

71
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:23,070
So that you can write more good poems in the future,

72
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:27,600
I will appoint you to the 9th Junior Rank Boosayong (military officer under the Department of Capital Defense).

73
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:31,800
Congratulations.

74
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:33,590
Your Majesty, I—

75
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,990
Receive whatever the king gives out. Be it a promotion or demotion.

76
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,630
That's the way to keep your life.

77
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:15,120
Minister of Personnel, I will try to meet the King once more.

78
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,500
No.

79
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:20,870
At times like this, if you step up needlessly, you will also get hurt.

80
00:09:20,870 --> 00:09:23,170
First Vice Premier!

81
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:28,940
If you are on your way to meet the King, let's go together.

82
00:09:28,940 --> 00:09:32,010
Do you have something specific to report to him?

83
00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:39,070
The king told me to come up with a way to catch the Snail Brides or something. Those that brought me down.

84
00:09:39,070 --> 00:09:41,530
He said I could use troops freely.

85
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:47,390
No! Troops of the Ministry of Defense should only be deployed for a war or in case of emergency.

86
00:09:47,390 --> 00:09:51,430
It cannot be used for personal revenge like that!

87
00:09:51,430 --> 00:09:53,780
It's not for revenge.

88
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:58,260
Naturally, rebellious groups should be caught.

89
00:09:58,260 --> 00:10:01,160
Thus, were you able to come up with a way?

90
00:10:01,160 --> 00:10:05,010
Even the Chief Royal Secretary had a hard time. I don't have any special solution.

91
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:09,160
I have to continue inspecting and carrying out patrols with the troops.

92
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:13,670
With such an ignorant method, how will you be able to catch them?

93
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:17,960
I am the one who's in a tight spot!

94
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:29,470
If this task is tough for you, I will make a request to the king and take over the task in your place.

95
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:33,900
Will you do so? I will let you use as many troops as you'd like.

96
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:39,010
Is that true?

97
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:43,860
Of course! In front of the silk shop located on the tavern 3-way intersection,

98
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:47,170
a new street stall opened. It operates just like this pawn shop.

99
00:10:47,170 --> 00:10:51,150
If we give them information, they give us rice.

100
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:53,330
I have loyalty so I didn't go.

101
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:57,150
Alright, thank you. But what kind of information does that place buy?

102
00:10:57,150 --> 00:11:00,000
They only ask about one thing.

103
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:08,220
Snail Brides.

104
00:11:14,110 --> 00:11:17,020
 Hour of the Pig (9-11pm)
Myeong Cheol Square 

105
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:22,060
Because there are so many who received the Snail Brides' help even in a short amount of time,

106
00:11:22,060 --> 00:11:24,500
there are massive amounts of papers collecting information.

107
00:11:25,410 --> 00:11:27,830
Sort them out by time and location

108
00:11:27,830 --> 00:11:32,440
and make sure to separately mark the cases where they appeared in both similar times and locations.

109
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:35,060
Yes, My Lord.

110
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:47,700
"When I went to the bathroom after the rooster crowed twice, there was no rice

111
00:11:47,700 --> 00:11:50,460
but when I returned from doing my business, there was rice.

112
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:52,930
The rooster then crowed three times."

113
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:56,280
"The fire went out in the chimney so I went next door to get some charcoal, and when I returned

114
00:11:56,280 --> 00:12:01,860
a bulletin was pasted on the wall. I'm not sure whether that was during the hour of the pig (9pm-11pm) or the rat (11pm- 1am)."

115
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:05,640
They want to catch us with this? In your dreams!

116
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:11,270
No, keep in mind the Deputy Commander's probation. Also, the King has started to keep us in check in many ways.

117
00:12:11,270 --> 00:12:15,260
You never know how these trivial movements could affect us.

118
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,290
We have to be on guard.

119
00:12:17,290 --> 00:12:19,490
Are you scared right now?

120
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,430
I'm nervous.

121
00:12:21,430 --> 00:12:23,970
Fine, fine!

122
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:31,730
Your father is here. You're here, My Lordship.

123
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,110
Chae Gyeong.

124
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:37,330
Father.

125
00:12:37,330 --> 00:12:40,270
What brings you here?

126
00:12:42,770 --> 00:12:47,610
Are you remembering to prepare the Grand Prince his meals? Are you sick anywhere?

127
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:49,190
No, I'm not sick.

128
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:53,760
You look like you've lost some weight. Is something wrong?

129
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,160
No, nothing is wrong, Mother.

130
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,470
When you didn't have an appetite, you should have at least drunk some of the honey water I used to prepare for you.

131
00:13:00,470 --> 00:13:03,650
The food will get cold! What are you doing instead of eating?

132
00:13:03,650 --> 00:13:08,730
She can't eat because she's answering your questions. Who are you blaming right now?

133
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:11,280
Really?

134
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:16,440
What can I do? No matter how many questions I ask, I'm still curious. Here.

135
00:13:17,390 --> 00:13:21,320
It would have been nice if the Grand Prince came to eat too.

136
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,630
Is he very busy?

137
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:31,660
Wow, this is delicious! You didn't cook this, did you?

138
00:13:31,660 --> 00:13:34,090
This rascal!

139
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,270
Here, have some of this.

140
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:41,470
How can you go this far?

141
00:13:41,470 --> 00:13:44,200
Take Myeong Hye back right now.

142
00:13:44,200 --> 00:13:48,400
You only speak of "comrades", "friends", and "family" with words.

143
00:13:48,400 --> 00:13:51,690
You pretend to treasure your people the most.

144
00:13:51,690 --> 00:13:56,570
Do you not see your savior and family, Myeong Hye?

145
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:59,750
She's doing everything she can to help you!

146
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:00,630
Mother!

147
00:14:00,630 --> 00:14:04,660
The King said that both the First Vice Premier

148
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:07,460
and even Chae Gyeong are his people.

149
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:11,840
How can I trust that child? So—

150
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:14,660
Brother is mistaken.

151
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:18,220
Chae Gyeong is my wife and my family!

152
00:14:18,220 --> 00:14:19,750
That is your delusion.

153
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:23,330
I will be the one to pay the price for my delusions,

154
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,340
so leave Chae Gyeong alone.

155
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:35,130
What happened to your absolute belief that we would bring the First Vice Premier to our side?!

156
00:14:38,660 --> 00:14:40,690
I'll leave now.

157
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:54,300
  Since when did you start suspecting His Highness the Grand Prince? 

158
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:58,060
  Since he returned. 

159
00:14:58,060 --> 00:14:59,470
  Why? 

160
00:14:59,470 --> 00:15:05,430
  Because he returned to exact his revenge against me and to take the throne. 

161
00:15:06,670 --> 00:15:11,390
  Even without those things, you are capable of killing His Highness the Grand Prince. 

162
00:15:11,390 --> 00:15:14,340
  Can't you relieve the misunderstandings in your brotherhood 

163
00:15:15,100 --> 00:15:17,820
  and make up? 

164
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:21,930
  Don't come any closer. 

165
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:22,850
  How dare you?! 

166
00:15:22,850 --> 00:15:25,000
  She is my wife! 

167
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:37,830
Goodness, it's obvious you're a newlywed.

168
00:15:37,830 --> 00:15:40,760
Do you feel that nervous about leaving your house for a few hours?

169
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:45,800
Do you think something will happen to your husband if you don't see him for one night?

170
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:51,920
There's nothing to be embarrassed about. I was like that too.

171
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,340
Pardon?

172
00:15:54,340 --> 00:15:59,600
When you're newlywed, it's difficult to remain apart even for fifteen minutes.

173
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:02,730
Eat.

174
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:11,480
Mother, I'm sorry. I can't sit still knowing that His Highness the Grand Prince is in that house alone.

175
00:16:11,480 --> 00:16:19,230
What? Hey, wait! Chae Gyeong, you have to take the side dishes I made!

176
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,270
  You'll have to pay the price for saving him. 

177
00:16:40,250 --> 00:16:44,070
  Young Lady, didn't you say you were going to sleep over? 

178
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,430
Did you come because you missed His Highness the Grand Prince?

179
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:54,600
I just came. Where is the Grand Prince?

180
00:16:54,600 --> 00:17:00,620
He hasn't come yet. You must be very tired, I'll heat up the bath water—

181
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:05,540
No. What are you doing when you should be heating up the bath water?

182
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:08,270
Ah, yes.

183
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:19,170
How is the Madam? Everyone is doing fine, right?

184
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:59,330
I've prepared some chrysanthemum petals. It will enhance the fragrance.

185
00:17:59,330 --> 00:18:01,160
Thank you.

186
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:08,680
When I wash, I only need Nanny.

187
00:19:39,040 --> 00:19:44,940
Leave right now! I already told Mother about this so don't think of using her as an excuse!

188
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:48,140
Do you think I'm doing this because I want to?

189
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:50,980
To protect you...

190
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,860
do you know what I went through?

191
00:19:56,740 --> 00:20:00,240
I know that you're working hard because of me

192
00:20:01,040 --> 00:20:05,480
so I'll pretend that I don't know you, for your sake. Let's just stop everything here!

193
00:20:07,100 --> 00:20:10,800
You probably pretended not to know for your own sake.

194
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:14,140
Yeah, you're right.

195
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:19,530
So when the sun comes up tomorrow, please,

196
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,610
please just leave. Okay?

197
00:20:33,370 --> 00:20:35,310
Please...

198
00:20:40,170 --> 00:20:41,900
No.

199
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:50,500
I think Sin Chae Gyeong has the secret order. He said there would be a tattoo.

200
00:20:57,890 --> 00:20:59,560
What is this?

201
00:21:01,210 --> 00:21:05,510
Orabeoni, by chance—did you know?

202
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:12,570
You knew?!

203
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:19,030
Since when?

204
00:21:19,030 --> 00:21:21,970
  The location where the secret order is hidden 

205
00:21:21,970 --> 00:21:24,870
  is tattooed on a woman's body. 

206
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:26,970
  Who is that woman? 

207
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:32,030
  She's very close to you, Your Highness the Grand Prince. 

208
00:21:33,060 --> 00:21:37,100
 The First Vice Premier's daughter. 

209
00:21:38,540 --> 00:21:43,930
Are you talking about Chae Gyeong?

210
00:21:43,930 --> 00:21:46,220
 I guess he believed 

211
00:21:46,220 --> 00:21:50,930
 that the maiden would protect you, Your Highness. 

212
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,160
How come you didn't tell me?

213
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,180
I will take care of that myself.

214
00:22:09,620 --> 00:22:11,780
If it's not done this way,

215
00:22:11,780 --> 00:22:15,710
Sin Chae Gyeong will be in even more danger.

216
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,850
What are you talking about?

217
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:22,530
If someone tries to forcefully confirm the tattoo on a woman's body,

218
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:26,110
what kind of method would they use?

219
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:29,840
Don't you dare.

220
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:35,540
If something like that were to happen, then you brought it up on yourself, not me.

221
00:22:35,540 --> 00:22:37,650
You keep on getting in the way

222
00:22:37,650 --> 00:22:40,390
so my uncle and the Queen Dowager

223
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:43,450
will probably have to use other means.

224
00:22:46,030 --> 00:22:50,290
If you indeed don't want Sin Chae Gyeong to be harmed, leave it to me.

225
00:22:52,060 --> 00:22:54,230
I'll just be watching her.

226
00:22:54,230 --> 00:22:56,430
So don't worry.

227
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:11,110
 Chae Gyeong. 

228
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,510
 What am I doing to you? 

229
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,270
Where have you been for all this time?

230
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:27,640
My lady!

231
00:23:37,020 --> 00:23:40,800
It looks like the Queen Dowager's movements are suspicious.

232
00:23:40,800 --> 00:23:45,570
The Queen Dowager who prohibited them from sleeping together even after the marriage

233
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:48,380
has set a date for them to sleep together.

234
00:23:48,380 --> 00:23:50,780
She has left for the Grand Prince's residence.

235
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:53,610
Who said that I was curious about their newlywed life?

236
00:23:53,610 --> 00:23:56,070
I apologize.

237
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:00,510
However, Lady Sin

238
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,680
seems to be deeply related to the secret order.

239
00:24:06,050 --> 00:24:07,800
What did you say?

240
00:25:09,910 --> 00:25:12,220
Chae Gyeong.

241
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:18,230
You'll see me soon enough. Why were you in such a hurry that you had to come all the way here?

242
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:20,790
Please do not misunderstand.

243
00:25:20,790 --> 00:25:25,230
I wasn't trying to peek at all.

244
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:27,130
Then what?

245
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:29,120
I was just...

246
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:33,270
I just came to see you.

247
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:43,810
Many eyes are watching.

248
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:46,520
I should at least do this much

249
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:49,500
for us to look like a newlywed couple.

250
00:25:57,410 --> 00:25:59,810
The bridal chamber is this way—

251
00:26:43,190 --> 00:26:47,440
You should've stayed at your parents' house longer so you can get plenty of rest.

252
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,580
What's so good about this place that you had to come back so early?

253
00:26:50,580 --> 00:26:53,530
I am no longer a member of my family.

254
00:26:53,530 --> 00:26:56,590
So I must stay beside my husband.

255
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,930
You must be tired so you should retire early.

256
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,460
What are you going to do about the marriage consummation?

257
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,460
The  Queen Dowager came by.

258
00:27:16,160 --> 00:27:17,510
Next time.

259
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:20,070
Weren't you in a hurry?

260
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:24,210
I'm talking about the secret order.

261
00:27:27,010 --> 00:27:30,170
Don't you need to find the secret order?

262
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:54,340
What are you talking about?

263
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,400
Are you going to pretend you don't know again?

264
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,640
 I did know. 

265
00:28:14,470 --> 00:28:17,850
 Also the fact that you are the woman of the secret order. 

266
00:28:26,570 --> 00:28:28,510
Take a look.

267
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,970
Is this what you wanted from me?

268
00:29:05,410 --> 00:29:07,880
 While knowing it all, 

269
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,700
 you were weighed down by such a cruel fate. 

270
00:29:13,490 --> 00:29:17,350
 During the times that I pretended not to know so you wouldn't be hurt anymore, 

271
00:29:17,350 --> 00:29:19,950
 you knew it all by yourself. 

272
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:23,060
When

273
00:29:24,690 --> 00:29:26,860
and what did you do to it?

274
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:32,930
Is that important now?

275
00:29:36,980 --> 00:29:40,870
I don't think I can endure any longer.

276
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:44,970
You knew it all but pretended not to know. You were suspicious but pretended to have faith.

277
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:49,320
You were anxious but pretended you were not.  I can't do this anymore either.

278
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:53,850
My faith and love for you

279
00:29:53,850 --> 00:29:58,560
which I thought could change one man's life

280
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:02,070
were probably too naive and foolish.

281
00:30:02,070 --> 00:30:08,250
Even if you approached me with an impure heart,

282
00:30:08,250 --> 00:30:10,850
the idea that you would've changed by now,

283
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:12,590
that you would have wavered thousands of times,

284
00:30:12,590 --> 00:30:17,230
I, who thought that my sincerity would be victorious in the end,

285
00:30:17,230 --> 00:30:19,570
- am probably very foolish, right? 
 - Chae Gyeong.

286
00:30:19,570 --> 00:30:22,530
That name!

287
00:30:22,530 --> 00:30:24,830
Don't call me that, please.

288
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:33,400
When you call me "Chae Gyeong,"

289
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:37,870
my heart melts.

290
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:40,250
I get fooled.

291
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:47,240
I say to myself, "Don't be fooled anymore" and "Don't waver." I ensure it won't happen

292
00:30:48,440 --> 00:30:50,260
but perhaps what I know

293
00:30:50,260 --> 00:30:52,390
and the things I have seen and heard

294
00:30:52,390 --> 00:30:56,170
could possibly be a mistake. It could  be a misunderstanding.

295
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:58,640
It keeps making me hopeful.

296
00:31:03,370 --> 00:31:05,290
Your Highness, the Grand Prince.

297
00:31:07,820 --> 00:31:10,140
Who are you?

298
00:31:12,180 --> 00:31:14,790
Why did you come to me?

299
00:31:18,850 --> 00:31:21,720
Why can't you answer me?

300
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:25,310
Is it because there are so many lies you need to explain?!!

301
00:31:26,070 --> 00:31:33,680
♫   I want to hold you, the one whose brilliance chills my heart   ♫

302
00:31:33,680 --> 00:31:41,190
♫   I'm afraid you might fly away when the wind blows   ♫

303
00:31:41,190 --> 00:31:45,690
♫   Because your smile and tears  ♫

304
00:31:45,690 --> 00:31:51,730
♫   fill my heart,   ♫

305
00:31:51,730 --> 00:31:58,170
♫    I will always love only you   ♫

306
00:32:00,200 --> 00:32:02,860
♫  This feeling which I tightly hold  ♫

307
00:32:02,860 --> 00:32:07,910
♫  can't be secretly hidden   ♫

308
00:32:07,910 --> 00:32:14,160
♫   We can't turn back because you are here  ♫

309
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:17,380
♫    Saying I love you even without saying the words   ♫

310
00:32:17,380 --> 00:32:22,020
I'm sorry, Chae Gyeong.

311
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,640
I was wrong. 
♫   I can't let you leave my embrace  ♫

312
00:32:30,050 --> 00:32:31,990
Let's leave.

313
00:32:32,950 --> 00:32:34,930
Like you said,

314
00:32:35,900 --> 00:32:41,600
let's move to Geochang and live there, Chae Gyeong.

315
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,470
♫   I'm afraid you  might fly away when the wind blows   ♫

316
00:32:47,810 --> 00:32:51,230
Do you know what makes me sadder now?

317
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:58,160
That I can no longer

318
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:05,390
believe your words.

319
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:10,630
♫    This love which cannot be hurts so much it is unbearable.   ♫

320
00:33:10,630 --> 00:33:14,630
Ask me to give you the secret order instead.

321
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:18,960
♫    Even if it kills me burying you in my heart is fine   ♫

322
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:23,430
I was wrong. 
 ♫    Even if it kills me burying you in my heart is fine   ♫

323
00:33:23,430 --> 00:33:31,690
♫    If I can protect you, I will love you.   ♫

324
00:33:33,710 --> 00:33:39,550
♫    I will always remember only you   ♫

325
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:52,410
All this time, she had them use separate bedrooms even after the marriage,

326
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:54,690
and suddenly she allowed the marriage to be consummated.

327
00:33:54,690 --> 00:33:59,590
She must have received new information that Lady Sin might be associated with the secret order.

328
00:33:59,590 --> 00:34:03,720
Thus, she must be trying to check this through consummation of marriage.

329
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:06,420
Queen Dowager is quite vicious indeed.

330
00:34:06,420 --> 00:34:09,070
She plans to thoroughly use Chae Gyeong

331
00:34:09,070 --> 00:34:11,560
and abandon her later.

332
00:34:13,030 --> 00:34:16,380
However, Chae Gyeong doesn't even know this

333
00:34:16,380 --> 00:34:21,260
and chose Yeok over me. Foolish one.

334
00:34:22,130 --> 00:34:25,810
Your Majesty, are you going to stay put like this?

335
00:34:25,810 --> 00:34:28,510
If Lady Sin is indeed the woman of the secret order,

336
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:31,220
before she hands over the secret order to Grand Prince Jin Seong,

337
00:34:31,220 --> 00:34:34,090
we have to find it first.

338
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:55,590
 Let's leave. 

339
00:34:56,420 --> 00:35:01,600
 Like you said, let's move to Geochang and live there, Chae Gyeong.   

340
00:35:10,340 --> 00:35:13,360
What brings you here, Deputy Commander?

341
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:17,630
Since we both have free time, I am here to have a chat.

342
00:35:17,630 --> 00:35:21,900
As you are aware, I was put on probation.

343
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,420
When the country is very unstable now,

344
00:35:24,420 --> 00:35:29,590
the king is unable to be the central force and enjoys the kissing up by disloyal subjects.

345
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:34,620
The five senses of the king have long become useless.

346
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:37,980
Deputy Commander! Your words are too harsh.

347
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:41,340
For a long time, even after suffering much humiliation,

348
00:35:41,340 --> 00:35:45,520
why would the Chief Royal Secretary stay by his side?

349
00:35:45,520 --> 00:35:51,080
He wants to make king blind and deaf so he can have Joseon at his feet.

350
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,660
Do you have a plan in mind?

351
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:58,280
If I have one, would you like to hear it?

352
00:36:01,170 --> 00:36:04,800
What do you think of the Grand Prince Jin Seong?

353
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,940
I need to lose weight.

354
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,200
- Is everyone here? 
 - Not yet.

355
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,560
It's been a while since I have climbed over a wall. I am hungry now.

356
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:49,310
What's that? Hurry up!

357
00:37:32,350 --> 00:37:34,290
Hey! What are you doing?

358
00:37:34,290 --> 00:37:37,060
Come here.

359
00:37:37,060 --> 00:37:39,090
Be careful!

360
00:37:43,960 --> 00:37:45,730
  As long as he finds the secret order   
 

361
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:47,970
  he thinks he can take the throne   
  

362
00:37:47,970 --> 00:37:51,070
  or keep it.  

363
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:56,650
 Why should I give the secret order to you?  

364
00:37:57,990 --> 00:38:01,210
 I am asking for the reason  

365
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:04,630
  why you should to become the king.  

366
00:38:10,270 --> 00:38:13,130
Hyungnim. What brings you here?

367
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:14,360
Just because.

368
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:17,230
I had to think about something.

369
00:38:17,230 --> 00:38:19,490
Stop right there!

370
00:38:19,490 --> 00:38:22,840
What is it? You don't want us to take off the masks?

371
00:38:27,910 --> 00:38:29,750
First Vice Premier!

372
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,960
Your Highness, the Grand Prince.

373
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,520
How did you find out about this place?

374
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:51,830
- Chief! 
 - Go and check if there are Royal Forces outside.

375
00:38:51,830 --> 00:38:53,970
I am here alone.

376
00:38:55,780 --> 00:38:58,340
I didn't tell anyone about it.

377
00:38:58,340 --> 00:39:02,670
- Not yet.
- Still, I'll go and confirm that.

378
00:39:10,230 --> 00:39:12,570
You must be curious

379
00:39:12,570 --> 00:39:14,930
how I was able to find out so quickly.

380
00:39:20,190 --> 00:39:22,810
With such poor information like this.

381
00:39:23,870 --> 00:39:28,860
Each one in itself is quite useless.

382
00:39:28,860 --> 00:39:31,660
However, if that adds up to be 100,

383
00:39:31,660 --> 00:39:34,990
it becomes quite useful information.

384
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:40,970
After connecting hundreds together to make a thousand and connecting thousands together to make ten thousand,

385
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:45,700
I was able to figure out the Snail Bride's route.

386
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:48,840
You waited in the route dressed like us?

387
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,660
Please stop here.

388
00:39:50,660 --> 00:39:53,830
You must disband the Snail Brides right away.

389
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,630
Look here!

390
00:39:57,580 --> 00:39:59,760
I can't do that.

391
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:03,350
As long as the king's tyranny continues,

392
00:40:03,350 --> 00:40:05,340
our work will go on.

393
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:08,300
You're not doing this out of pure chivalry.

394
00:40:08,300 --> 00:40:11,610
There is something else that you really want!

395
00:40:20,510 --> 00:40:23,170
  Why do you want to be king? 

396
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:28,340
 Must you become king?  

397
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:33,520
  You startled me.  

398
00:40:35,030 --> 00:40:37,080
  You're late.  

399
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:40,980
  Those flowers are a gift for me since you're sorry? 

400
00:40:41,970 --> 00:40:45,480
  The king gave us a gift too.  

401
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:52,080
  By chance, are you hurt or injured anywhere?   

402
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:54,190
  No, I'm not.  

403
00:40:57,220 --> 00:40:58,930
  Can't you  

404
00:41:00,410 --> 00:41:04,700
  just live as the Grand Prince?  

405
00:41:15,210 --> 00:41:17,590
Everything is fine outside.

406
00:41:19,030 --> 00:41:21,480
It won't make a big difference just

407
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,330
because I found out about this place.

408
00:41:24,330 --> 00:41:27,320
Even the king stopped by right in front of here,

409
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:33,860
yet you bravely continue planning the rebellion.

410
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:36,990
You can find new hideouts easily.

411
00:41:36,990 --> 00:41:41,160
However, there is only one place you can lean your heart on.

412
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:45,250
As you live your life, whose side and heart do you think

413
00:41:45,250 --> 00:41:48,190
you can sincerely lean and depend on?

414
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:50,930
Is it the throne in the council hall?

415
00:41:52,860 --> 00:41:57,200
Soon there will be a curfew in and out of the capital.

416
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:59,690
It's a step to prevent the bulletins from spreading.

417
00:41:59,690 --> 00:42:03,980
Also, there will be an order to sweep the Snail Brides.

418
00:42:03,980 --> 00:42:08,200
Before that happens, disband the Snail Brides,

419
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:10,820
and leave for the countryside with Chae Gyeong.

420
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:15,950
If you can't do so, break up with Chae Gyeong.

421
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:20,820
I can't have my daughter live as a traitor's wife.

422
00:42:28,500 --> 00:42:29,990
What are you doing!

423
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,500
Will you really release him like this?

424
00:42:31,500 --> 00:42:33,200
He's the First Vice Premier.

425
00:42:33,200 --> 00:42:36,100
He's the leader of the Queen's family and an official of the royalist faction.

426
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:40,110
Trusting Lady Chae Gyeong is a separate issue from trusting the First Vice Premier.

427
00:42:40,110 --> 00:42:43,830
So do you want to kill the First Vice Premier or something?!

428
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:52,090
He's Chae Gyeong's father,

429
00:42:52,090 --> 00:42:55,540
my father-in-law, and a loyal subject of this nation.

430
00:42:55,540 --> 00:42:59,540
He's not someone who will easily let innocent people die.

431
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:02,400
Just in case, he didn't even see your faces.

432
00:43:02,400 --> 00:43:06,480
If something happens from today's incident, I will take responsibility for everything.

433
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,130
Thus,

434
00:43:09,870 --> 00:43:11,670
let him leave.

435
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:18,780
This is an order!

436
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:53,130
My Lord, exactly what have you been doing?

437
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:56,710
I mean, why are you in this state?

438
00:43:56,710 --> 00:44:01,160
Water, please give me some water.

439
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,520
Yes.

440
00:44:02,520 --> 00:44:07,370
My Lord, someone from the palace is here.

441
00:44:08,850 --> 00:44:11,460
At this hour?

442
00:44:14,230 --> 00:44:17,130
 They will easily be able to find your hideout again, 

443
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:22,200
  but there is only person you can rely on. 

444
00:44:23,310 --> 00:44:27,610
  Ah, this... this is... you remember that time in the cave?  

445
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,510
  Maybe it's because it was a poisoned arrow— 

446
00:44:29,510 --> 00:44:33,430
  Did I say anything? Even if you had told me this wound was from years ago, 

447
00:44:33,430 --> 00:44:36,890
  I would have believed you 

448
00:44:36,890 --> 00:44:41,310
  because trusting you is something I can do on my own will and volition. 

449
00:44:41,310 --> 00:44:46,430
  We'll live in the farthest place from the capital 

450
00:44:46,430 --> 00:44:50,040
  and settle down for an ordinary life. 

451
00:44:52,550 --> 00:44:57,790
  I cannot allow my child to live as the wife of a traitor. 

452
00:45:02,280 --> 00:45:06,280
Everyone escaped safely. Although it's quiet right now—

453
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:07,870
Hyungnim!

454
00:45:07,870 --> 00:45:11,840
Yeok, even if he is your father-in-law,

455
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:13,810
isn't this being too reckless?

456
00:45:13,810 --> 00:45:16,810
Things will get complicated if the Deputy Commander finds out.

457
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:21,870
Either we move our hideout immediately or shut the First Vice Premier's mouth. Let's make a decision.

458
00:45:21,870 --> 00:45:25,270
Why didn't any of you ask me

459
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:31,700
the reason I have to become the King?

460
00:45:35,570 --> 00:45:39,310
Doesn't the fact that you're pondering over that question and attempting to prove yourself mean that you're fit to be King?

461
00:45:39,310 --> 00:45:43,360
The current King has lost both the sentiment of the people and the will of the Heavens.

462
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:49,410
Even the puppet ministers who don't care who sits on the throne, as long as they retain their power,

463
00:45:49,410 --> 00:45:53,210
have started to turn their backs on the King. Do you need another reason?

464
00:45:53,210 --> 00:45:58,450
At the very least, you consider the people's lives as the most precious.

465
00:45:59,330 --> 00:46:02,030
You have the heart that knows how to protect your people.

466
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:07,470
If you become the King, all the people of Joseon will become your people.

467
00:46:07,470 --> 00:46:10,510
I'm certain that you will do well.

468
00:46:13,540 --> 00:46:15,750
But what if I'm

469
00:46:16,900 --> 00:46:20,640
not protecting the person most precious to me?

470
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:25,030
  Chae Gyeong has no idea of 

471
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:31,180
  the danger closing in on her everyday. 

472
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,840
She trusts me

473
00:46:44,660 --> 00:46:48,230
and lives in that prison-like house.

474
00:46:48,810 --> 00:46:51,670
My brother's monitoring wasn't enough;

475
00:46:51,670 --> 00:46:55,930
now, even my mother has placed someone to watch her.

476
00:46:56,520 --> 00:46:59,190
What? Who?

477
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:02,400
Myeong Hye is near Chae Gyeong.

478
00:47:02,400 --> 00:47:06,650
If she places Young Lady Myeong Hye there, it's just war!

479
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:09,700
Young Lady Myeong Hye is unexpectedly vicious.

480
00:47:09,700 --> 00:47:12,370
Will your wife be okay?

481
00:47:12,370 --> 00:47:16,360
Did Her Highness the Queen Dowager also send her to the prison last time?

482
00:47:16,360 --> 00:47:18,650
The prison?

483
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:21,930
Tell me properly, what is it?

484
00:47:21,930 --> 00:47:24,200
You see...

485
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:26,750
Young Lady Myeong Hye was trapped inside the prison cell.

486
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:32,310
It seemed as if she were monitoring Young Lady Chae Gyeong just in case she said anything about us.

487
00:47:35,230 --> 00:47:38,270
I'm sure that wasn't the sole reason.

488
00:47:39,570 --> 00:47:42,000
Yeok!

489
00:47:57,980 --> 00:48:00,390
Goodness! What should I do?!

490
00:48:00,390 --> 00:48:02,900
Weren't you two sleeping together tonight?

491
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:07,550
If I knew that you two would be sleeping separately, I would have remained by her side!

492
00:48:12,780 --> 00:48:17,130
In this house, that is a palace servant's reason for existing. How could you not know that she disappeared?!

493
00:48:17,130 --> 00:48:19,510
Your Highness the Grand Prince.

494
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:21,770
Was it a royal command?

495
00:48:21,770 --> 00:48:23,360
Yes.

496
00:48:23,360 --> 00:48:28,900
A royal command was issued under the Chief Royal Secretary's order.

497
00:48:34,330 --> 00:48:38,120
Orabeoni isn't here either?

498
00:48:38,120 --> 00:48:42,630
Exactly where did he go? Sin Chae Gyeong has disappeared too.

499
00:48:43,790 --> 00:48:46,070
Is it true

500
00:48:46,950 --> 00:48:50,740
that you're near Young Lady Chae Gyeong without telling her of your identity?

501
00:48:53,730 --> 00:48:59,470
Did you try to kill Young Lady Chae Gyeong in prison last time?

502
00:49:00,070 --> 00:49:03,800
Why...

503
00:49:03,800 --> 00:49:07,070
- Why are you suddenly asking me that?
- Is it true?

504
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:14,140
I told Hyungnim everything.

505
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,330
What?

506
00:49:15,330 --> 00:49:21,540
Were you planning to kill her this time too?

507
00:49:23,610 --> 00:49:26,100
You're pitiful.

508
00:49:44,700 --> 00:49:48,040
Be careful, First Vice Premier.

509
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:52,600
You'll have to risk your head on every single word.

510
00:49:53,620 --> 00:49:57,170
What have you plotted this time?

511
00:49:57,170 --> 00:50:02,440
I tell you this all the time; I do not plot anything,

512
00:50:02,440 --> 00:50:08,260
it is always something you and your daughter initiate.

513
00:50:18,210 --> 00:50:25,000
First Vice-Premier, did you truly deceive me?

514
00:50:26,260 --> 00:50:29,800
What are you talking about?

515
00:50:29,800 --> 00:50:32,140
No wonder...

516
00:50:32,140 --> 00:50:35,780
from the moment I saw you together with Her Highness the Queen Dowager,

517
00:50:35,780 --> 00:50:38,840
- I felt uneasy. 
- Your Majesty.

518
00:50:38,840 --> 00:50:44,230
When did you find out about Grand Prince Jin Seong?

519
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:51,980
Did you know he was alive before he dragged those royal offerings into the palace?

520
00:50:55,750 --> 00:51:00,540
Look at this, you knew.

521
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:05,030
I did not know for certain, but you did.

522
00:51:05,030 --> 00:51:09,810
You knew everything yet you deceived me, scorned me!

523
00:51:09,810 --> 00:51:13,130
Your Majesty, I apologize!

524
00:51:13,130 --> 00:51:17,950
I truly did not have the slightest thought of scorning you.

525
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,020
I only speculated but was not certain;

526
00:51:21,020 --> 00:51:24,330
therefore, I could not tell you in that short period of time.

527
00:51:25,940 --> 00:51:28,120
What else do you know?

528
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:32,740
By any chance, do you know what he is attempting to do?

529
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,320
Do you know what he is going around doing?

530
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:43,310
Then what about this...

531
00:51:43,310 --> 00:51:46,910
your child, Chae Gyeong.

532
00:51:49,300 --> 00:51:52,480
Does Chae Gyeong

533
00:51:53,860 --> 00:51:57,170
have a tattoo anywhere on her body?

534
00:51:58,430 --> 00:52:05,170
Your Majesty, why do you ask me that?

535
00:52:05,170 --> 00:52:08,170
The location where my father's secret order is hidden

536
00:52:08,170 --> 00:52:13,280
is tattooed on a woman's body.

537
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:18,240
By any chance, is Chae Gyeong that woman?

538
00:52:22,030 --> 00:52:24,790
If it is Chae Gyeong,

539
00:52:24,790 --> 00:52:29,210
then that means both you and my father have planned

540
00:52:29,210 --> 00:52:33,220
to place Grand Prince Jin Seong on the throne since 20 years ago

541
00:52:33,220 --> 00:52:39,210
by tattooing the body of the woman of the subject I would not suspect.

542
00:52:39,210 --> 00:52:42,380
Your Majesty, that's utter nonsense!

543
00:52:42,380 --> 00:52:45,850
I swear that nothing of the sort happened!

544
00:52:45,850 --> 00:52:48,560
Please believe me!

545
00:52:49,450 --> 00:52:54,480
So, Chae Gyeong is definitely not the woman?

546
00:52:56,430 --> 00:53:00,180
Yes, that is true.

547
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,920
I can't even trust your words anymore.

548
00:53:09,740 --> 00:53:11,800
Your Majesty,

549
00:53:11,800 --> 00:53:18,060
that is why I have brought someone who will reveal the truth on this matter.

550
00:53:18,660 --> 00:53:21,530
May I call her in?

551
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:29,420
Enter.

552
00:53:58,190 --> 00:54:00,140
Your Majesty.

553
00:54:00,910 --> 00:54:04,950
Exactly what is it that disturbs you so much?

554
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:11,740
If you just get rid of the secret order, will your heart be at peace again?

555
00:54:11,740 --> 00:54:14,580
Will you be able to return things back to the way they originally were?

556
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:20,200
If the secret order is disposed, my throne will be secured

557
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:23,150
and his greed will be nipped in the bud.

558
00:54:23,150 --> 00:54:27,630
Your Majesty, my child knows absolutely nothing.

559
00:54:27,630 --> 00:54:28,930
Therefore,

560
00:54:29,860 --> 00:54:32,640
that's what I want to confirm right now.

561
00:54:32,640 --> 00:54:35,380
Whether the father and daughter of the Sin Clan really do not know anything

562
00:54:35,380 --> 00:54:41,070
or... if they know everything and are deceiving me.

563
00:54:48,270 --> 00:54:51,120
Would you like to confirm?

564
00:54:51,120 --> 00:54:53,320
Strip her.

565
00:54:53,320 --> 00:54:55,200
Your Majesty!

566
00:54:56,870 --> 00:54:58,700
Chae Gyeong!

567
00:54:59,650 --> 00:55:03,150
How dare you touch me?! Move aside!

568
00:55:06,220 --> 00:55:07,580
Continue.

569
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,260
Your Majesty!

570
00:55:10,320 --> 00:55:12,130
Sook Won! (Royal Consort)

571
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:19,130
I'll do it myself. If His Majesty must see with his own eyes to release me,

572
00:55:19,130 --> 00:55:22,410
then I will gladly do as you wish.

573
00:55:40,550 --> 00:55:43,210
What do you think you're doing?!

574
00:55:57,920 --> 00:56:00,060
You're okay now.

575
00:56:00,060 --> 00:56:02,490
What are you planning to do?

576
00:56:09,480 --> 00:56:13,020
What do you think you're doing?

577
00:56:13,020 --> 00:56:16,120
Why did you come so late at night without notice?

578
00:56:16,120 --> 00:56:22,150
I have brought a farewell present for you, Brother.

579
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:24,620
A farewell present?

580
00:56:24,620 --> 00:56:28,650
Didn't my wife sincerely request for you

581
00:56:28,650 --> 00:56:32,170
to allow us to live in the countryside?

582
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:41,020
How can you say such a sorrowful thing? You have to become King.

583
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:43,920
I'm different from you.

584
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:45,960
I...

585
00:56:50,180 --> 00:56:53,760
do not want to become King

586
00:56:55,060 --> 00:56:57,700
if it hurts the person I love.

587
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,960
You bastard!

588
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:18,190
 Hong Zhi 1st Year (1488)
April 15th 

589
00:57:18,190 --> 00:57:22,200
Stop him! Didn't you hear me?! Kill Grand Prince Jin Seong right now!

590
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:24,400
Halt!

591
00:57:35,010 --> 00:57:38,410
Heed the late King's secret order!

592
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:50,760
 Hong Zhi 1st Year (1488)
April 15th 

593
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:52,790
The secret order?

594
00:57:54,160 --> 00:58:01,210
You truly... found that?

595
00:58:06,560 --> 00:58:09,590
"On the day Grand Prince Jin Seong becomes an adult,

596
00:58:09,590 --> 00:58:18,380
Lee Yoong will abdicate the throne to Grand Prince Jin Seong and do his best to assist his younger brother."

597
00:58:30,200 --> 00:58:38,600
In the end, Father... I'll kill everyone. All of you!

598
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:42,890
You can't! You can't. You can't, Your Majesty.

599
00:58:45,380 --> 00:58:52,610
You... did you truly give the secret order to him?

600
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:58,300
You gave it to Yeok, not me?

601
00:58:59,050 --> 00:59:00,920
Your Majesty.

602
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:11,810
Do you truly wish to make him King?

603
00:59:11,810 --> 00:59:18,140
No, Your Majesty. That's nonsense. Regardless of what the late King's will is,

604
00:59:18,140 --> 00:59:22,900
you are my only ruler!

605
00:59:23,820 --> 00:59:28,960
Your Majesty! Please calm down! It's not over yet.

606
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:33,290
Even if he has the late King's will, we have to follow procedures and—

607
00:59:33,290 --> 00:59:35,820
There's no need to do that.

608
00:59:38,420 --> 00:59:41,630
I just have to take what's mine.

609
00:59:44,290 --> 00:59:50,190
Haven't I already told you? Chae Gyeong and I will move to the countryside.

610
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:56,150
What?

611
00:59:58,300 --> 01:00:04,090
The King is appointed by the Heavens.

612
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:10,850
Yes, as you suspected, Chae Gyeong had the secret order.

613
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:19,170
I thought that might be the last chance the Heavens were giving you.

614
01:00:21,350 --> 01:00:25,520
Proof that the Heavens still expect something from you.

615
01:00:25,520 --> 01:00:31,150
So that the people won't have to wait for the faceless Snail Brides,

616
01:00:31,150 --> 01:00:37,350
the Heaven's earnest will for the King here in this palace to become a good ruler!

617
01:00:40,570 --> 01:00:44,040
Chae Gyeong wished for that more than anyone else.

618
01:01:03,620 --> 01:01:09,330
  Can't you give the King one last chance? 

619
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:15,220
  Trusting and assisting your brother, the current King, to become a better ruler, 

620
01:01:15,220 --> 01:01:20,420
  isn't it the duty of the people and the subject to wait? 

621
01:01:21,880 --> 01:01:24,200
  Then promise me 

622
01:01:24,200 --> 01:01:27,970
  that before you find the reason why you must become King,  

623
01:01:27,970 --> 01:01:33,350
 you will never use this to become King. 

624
01:01:36,390 --> 01:01:38,300
  Then why are you giving it to me? 

625
01:01:38,300 --> 01:01:43,560
  Because you must risk your life for what you do, 

626
01:01:43,560 --> 01:01:47,730
  I'm giving this to you as the ultimate defense that can save you. 

627
01:01:47,730 --> 01:01:53,640
So, I wish to give you one more chance.

628
01:01:55,490 --> 01:02:02,120
I, Grand Prince Jin Seong, Lee Yeok, will follow my father, the late King's will

629
01:02:03,130 --> 01:02:05,820
and place myself on the throne!

630
01:02:11,100 --> 01:02:21,190
And now, I will abdicate the throne to my brother.

631
01:02:26,130 --> 01:02:27,630
Are you writing everything down, Scribe?!

632
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:29,960
Y-Yes, Your Majesty!

633
01:02:38,640 --> 01:02:41,180
This is my answer.

634
01:02:47,890 --> 01:02:50,060
Stop.

635
01:02:56,850 --> 01:03:01,550
What if I can't allow it?

636
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:04,560
Then kill me.

637
01:03:05,490 --> 01:03:08,530
Even if you kill me,

638
01:03:09,690 --> 01:03:13,600
you won't be able to get what you want.

639
01:03:16,070 --> 01:03:23,580
Because even as a ghost, I will be together with Chae Gyeong.

640
01:03:36,630 --> 01:03:43,590
