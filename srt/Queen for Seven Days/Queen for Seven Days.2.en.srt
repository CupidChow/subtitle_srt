1
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:52,180
Even if I have to die, I must know the reason.

2
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:55,080
Then what is the reason I cannot kill you?

3
00:00:55,080 --> 00:01:00,390
I'm Your Majesty's younger brother.

4
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:02,550
We were born from the same father...

5
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:05,150
That's the first reason why you must die.

6
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:09,260
Do you think your older brother will be any different? You two aren't even full-blooded brothers.

7
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:12,470
Become the son-in-law of Chief Royal Secretary Sin Soo Geun.

8
00:01:12,470 --> 00:01:16,930
Go into their household and live quietly in the countryside of Geochang.

9
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:19,080
Why must I do that?

10
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:22,270
I trust you, Hyungnim.

11
00:01:24,330 --> 00:01:26,280
Young Master!

12
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:31,780
Young Master! Young Master!

13
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,950
Who are you?

14
00:01:51,690 --> 00:01:55,880
Could I also know the meaning of that gaze?

15
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,590
♫ Can't you tell me that you love me, too ♫

16
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:04,930
♫ Maybe would you ♫

17
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,720
♫ Tomorrow, I'll blow you a kiss ♫

18
00:02:07,720 --> 00:02:12,640
♫ Would you say please give me some more of this ♫

19
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,070
♫  Would you?  ♫

20
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,070
Is this not the place?

21
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:26,530
If you go in again, you'll catch a cold.

22
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:31,310
♫  But I know you that you'll never love me the way that I love you, baby ♫

23
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:35,340
Thank you! You're much healthier than I am,

24
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:37,780
yet you're even worrying about my health.

25
00:02:37,780 --> 00:02:41,320
Then, please enjoy the nice view.

26
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:48,120
Nice view?

27
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,720
By any chance...

28
00:02:54,230 --> 00:02:57,640
please become my older brother!

29
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,760
♫ How hard I would try ♫

30
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:05,060
Episode 2

31
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:07,230
This way, right over here.

32
00:03:09,830 --> 00:03:13,970
Over there, right there. You can see the light from the inn, can't you?

33
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:15,900
Yes, I see it.

34
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,220
I'm still young so if I go in alone, I don't think they'll give me a room.

35
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,880
If you tell them that you're my older brother,

36
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,700
I think they'll accept me.

37
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,910
Is there a reason I must do that?

38
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:32,800
I got hurt while I was chasing you, and also ...

39
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:36,660
Why is that my fault?

40
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:41,320
Wow. Do you not have any family members or younger siblings at home?

41
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:50,130
Still, it's humane to help someone in need.

42
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:53,850
If you're not a wolf in sheep's clothing—

43
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,240
You have no fear.

44
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,290
If I had no fear, for what reason would I ask you this favor?

45
00:04:00,290 --> 00:04:03,170
I would just sleep out here.

46
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:07,740
Let's go.

47
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,810
As expected, people who look like this are never cold.

48
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:24,500
Didn't you hear me? She ran away from home.

49
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:27,580
Hand her over to the Investigation Bureau when the sun rises.

50
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:30,420
Hyungnim, why are you lying?

51
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,870
Auntie, my older brother

52
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:36,070
is trying to abandon me right now because of our difficult financial situation.

53
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:38,030
Please stop him.

54
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:41,190
Where is the evidence that I am your older brother?

55
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,820
You have a scar next to your bellybutton.

56
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:46,310
Hurry up and take your clothes off.

57
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:51,010
- That's—
- Settle family arguments inside.

58
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:54,420
It's this room, right over there.

59
00:04:56,530 --> 00:05:00,290
Should I tell you about other scars, aside from the one next to your bellybutton?

60
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:05,360
Sign for Joomak -- a tavern or inn

61
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:30,710
That's when that gangster stole my silk pouch!

62
00:05:30,710 --> 00:05:35,350
Still, you wandered around all day to find that?

63
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,660
How much money was in there?

64
00:05:37,660 --> 00:05:42,260
Money is another matter. There was an important letter in that silk pouch.

65
00:05:42,260 --> 00:05:46,200
I need that so when they ask "Why did you come?"

66
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,860
I can answer, "I came to give you this."

67
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:54,190
I can at least make an excuse with that.

68
00:05:54,190 --> 00:05:58,300
Must you have a reason to go to your parents' house?

69
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:06,990
They told me not to come.

70
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,890
You're afraid of not being welcomed.

71
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:22,220
Then what about you? In the middle of the night, why were you stark—

72
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:25,790
Why were you like that?

73
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,040
I was cooling the fever that consumed my

74
00:06:32,040 --> 00:06:34,890
entire heart and soul.

75
00:06:34,890 --> 00:06:40,280
My late father continues to test my younger brother and me.

76
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:49,000
Not long ago, in my village school, there was a race.

77
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,160
They said that they would give something to eat to the winner.

78
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,070
So everyone worked hard and arrived at the finish line

79
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:59,550
but then, the principal told us to race again.

80
00:06:59,550 --> 00:07:01,960
So what could we do? We raced again.

81
00:07:01,960 --> 00:07:05,020
Then again and again, he told us to race again.

82
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:07,640
We raced multiple times.

83
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:12,410
One kid realized that something was strange

84
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,550
and asked his friends to race together.

85
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:18,040
So everyone put their arms on each others' shoulders and raced again.

86
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:21,810
Then, the principal laughed and gave them something to eat.

87
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:27,420
Everyone together? He said together.

88
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,320
Can't you also pass the test together with your brother?

89
00:07:33,100 --> 00:07:37,400
Unfortunately, it's not something we can share—

90
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:43,790
Warrior!

91
00:09:49,770 --> 00:09:52,460
He's not dead. Why isn't he waking up?

92
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:55,420
Warrior! Warrior!

93
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:00,880
Oh hurry, Father...

94
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,220
What do I do?

95
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:23,400
Father, Father...

96
00:11:12,930 --> 00:11:14,680
I made it.

97
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:33,030
Who are you?

98
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:41,920
Please open the door. I have to go to the physician. A person is—

99
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:52,510
- Open the gate!
- Paru (bell ring to announce end of the curfew) hasn't rang yet.

100
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,330
It's a royal command.

101
00:12:27,190 --> 00:12:29,750
Have you come to your senses?

102
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:34,000
Warrior, are you alright?

103
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:36,800
You really have no fear.

104
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:41,400
You should've run away by yourself. Why did you suffer so much to save me as well?

105
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:45,800
Why would I leave my family behind?

106
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:52,560
You became my older brother, didn't you?

107
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:57,540
A family should live together,

108
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,570
and if they have to die, they should die together.

109
00:13:01,850 --> 00:13:06,300
By the way, after drinking the wine,

110
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:10,230
there was a dead person at the inn.

111
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,650
I've notified the Investigative Bureau, so you needn't worry.

112
00:13:12,650 --> 00:13:17,650
You must've been very shocked, so get some more sleep. Forget about what happened yesterday.

113
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,370
I was trying to go home.

114
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:25,360
I miss my mother and father.

115
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,820
I must've gone crazy.

116
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,170
I should've just stayed at home and not come out.

117
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,230
I almost died without seeing the faces of my family members.

118
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:41,370
Really.

119
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:07,040
Let's go.

120
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,020
You could have been in big trouble. In the future, I'll escort you more closely.

121
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:13,660
Do so, if you want to die.

122
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,510
His Majesty the King is entering!

123
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:31,240
Exactly how are you governing the city?

124
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:36,960
Wicked thugs were pretending to be innkeepers and were harming innocent people passing by.

125
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,340
In a place not so far from the capital.

126
00:14:40,340 --> 00:14:43,560
We apologize, Your Majesty.

127
00:15:08,730 --> 00:15:13,820
Head of Hansungbu (Magistrate of Capital Patrol) and Police Chief of the Right district will be dismissed immediately!

128
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:21,050
If this happens again, you will also be held responsible to the strictest standards.

129
00:15:21,050 --> 00:15:22,940
Yes, Your Majesty.

130
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:42,220
He's been like that since last night.

131
00:15:49,400 --> 00:15:51,570
Your Majesty, what happened yesterday—

132
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:56,100
I haven't changed my mind. Become the son-in-law of Sin Soo Geun.

133
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,970
Then, you will also be more at ease.

134
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:23,030
Now, what excuse can I have to return home?

135
00:16:33,390 --> 00:16:38,500
Next time if we meet again, I will grant you a wish.

136
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:42,330
He's not the Great Jade Emperor (God) or anything.

137
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:49,040
- Get lost.
- Give me back what you stole from me!

138
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,720
I told you to let go!

139
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:56,720
My wish is to catch that brazen young master.

140
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:21,570
Who is it?

141
00:17:23,270 --> 00:17:25,540
The Heavens have helped me.

142
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:29,060
When there are guests, they won't scold me.

143
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:39,640
Can you guess why I came to your house?

144
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,610
I have no idea.

145
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:49,930
I'm sure you've heard that Grand Prince Jin Seong's marriage has been decided.

146
00:17:49,930 --> 00:17:55,630
Instead of sending someone, I thought I would be able to relay my sincerity by coming directly.

147
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:08,010
Young Lady!

148
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:10,690
- Young Lady, where were you?
- Nanny!

149
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:16,070
Are you alright?

150
00:18:19,230 --> 00:18:25,220
I would like to have your daughter as my daughter-in-law.

151
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:33,510
However, my daughter isn't a good match for His Highness the Grand Prince.

152
00:18:33,510 --> 00:18:35,830
Yes, Queen Dowager.

153
00:18:35,830 --> 00:18:40,340
Our Chae Gyeong is too lacking to be the Grand Prince's wife.

154
00:18:40,340 --> 00:18:41,400
Mother.

155
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,780
She was weak since she was young so we raised her in the countryside.

156
00:18:44,780 --> 00:18:47,030
We don't know when she'll fall sick again.

157
00:18:47,030 --> 00:18:48,890
I'm healthy, Mother.

158
00:18:48,890 --> 00:18:54,350
Using the excuse that she's sick, she is lazy in her studies, and we haven't taught her anything else.

159
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:59,080
She is barely able to read.

160
00:18:59,080 --> 00:19:01,510
She doesn't know anything about etiquette or rules.

161
00:19:01,510 --> 00:19:06,000
She grew up among servants, so her behavior is crude.

162
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,900
As for etiquette and rules, she can learn them.

163
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:13,100
As for her health, we have an outstanding physician at the palace,

164
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:16,470
so it's also a good thing for your daughter.

165
00:19:16,470 --> 00:19:22,750
However, my daughter will be a huge nuisance for your family and the Royal Court.

166
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:29,630
Mother, Father, why are you making me into such a worthless person?

167
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:32,930
I think differently than my mother, Chief Royal Secretary.

168
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:34,520
Grand Prince!

169
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:40,600
I have absolutely no desire to marry your—

170
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:47,890
We meet again, Bird Poop.

171
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:06,530
You! How did you come here?

172
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:14,060
Chae Gyeong!

173
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:18,430
Mother, Father.

174
00:20:28,510 --> 00:20:30,930
She's so happy.

175
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:56,510
She seems quite different from what I just heard, Chief Royal Secretary.

176
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:05,730
Although my fathers' words aren't wrong,

177
00:21:05,730 --> 00:21:12,460
I'm putting effort each day to make up for what I lack, Your Highness the Queen Dowager.

178
00:21:13,970 --> 00:21:16,050
She's even humble.

179
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:20,680
I believe the Chief Royal Secretary's words are correct.

180
00:21:20,680 --> 00:21:25,110
No, I'm certain she's even worse.

181
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,980
Grand Prince, what are you talking about?

182
00:21:28,980 --> 00:21:32,460
It's a shameful incident to speak of, Mother.

183
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,920
However, I can tell you one thing is for certain.

184
00:21:38,830 --> 00:21:43,520
I will never marry this child.

185
00:21:48,120 --> 00:21:49,950
No!

186
00:21:51,980 --> 00:21:56,240
I will marry him.

187
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,530
What's the reason?!

188
00:22:08,530 --> 00:22:12,020
What about you? What's your reason? Why do you keep appearing in front of me?

189
00:22:12,020 --> 00:22:16,040
Out of all things, you even changed your gender?

190
00:22:19,160 --> 00:22:22,040
Is it a problem that I appeared? Or is it a problem that I'm a woman?

191
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,480
Do you know what I went through that day because of you?

192
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,770
I almost died because of you!

193
00:22:26,770 --> 00:22:31,070
Yet, I have to marry you? I have to preserve my life through your household?

194
00:22:31,070 --> 00:22:35,620
At this point where I hate the fact that you're the Chief Royal Secretary's daughter, it has to be you, Bird-poop?

195
00:22:35,620 --> 00:22:37,660
You almost died because you fell off your horse?

196
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,750
I almost died at His Majesty's sword because I arrived late!

197
00:22:40,750 --> 00:22:44,510
Why would His Majesty the King kill you?

198
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,390
Then what's your reason for wanting to marry? Because you covet the title of the Grand Prince's woman?

199
00:22:49,390 --> 00:22:50,880
Pardon?!

200
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,960
Your family loves titles. Your aunt, Her Highness the Queen, is the mother of this nation.

201
00:22:55,960 --> 00:23:01,430
Your father, Sin Soo Geun, the Chief Royal Secretary who holds power in the Royal Court. Your uncle holds military power.

202
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,680
Now, if you also marry me, your family will be so arrogant.

203
00:23:06,680 --> 00:23:08,500
What are you talking about, seriously?!

204
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,710
If that's not the reason, then what is it?!

205
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:12,570
I want to show them I can do it too!

206
00:23:12,570 --> 00:23:17,370
As I told you earlier, she's quite headstrong.

207
00:23:17,370 --> 00:23:20,770
Grand Prince Jin Seong isn't easy to handle either.

208
00:23:20,770 --> 00:23:24,820
They call this "fate".

209
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:30,200
I'm not a nuisance in the Sin household, nor am I an ugly duckling.

210
00:23:30,250 --> 00:23:34,280
I want to show them I'm fully capable of marrying someone like the Grand Prince.

211
00:23:34,280 --> 00:23:39,260
Frankly speaking, I'm a waste for the Grand Prince, not the other way around.

212
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,210
What? A waste?

213
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:48,270
They always say that a woman has to marry into a family that is a bit worse off than hers to live well.

214
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,720
You're really funny.

215
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:54,400
Thank you for the compliment. Just return my pouch.

216
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,010
Pouch?

217
00:23:56,010 --> 00:23:59,610
The silk pouch that contains the letter and some coins.

218
00:23:59,610 --> 00:24:02,980
Where did you lose it that you're asking me for it?

219
00:24:02,980 --> 00:24:08,990
You really like to show off that you're from the countryside. In Hanyang, your soul could be pickpocketed in an instant.

220
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,110
- What now?!
- Prove that you're not the thief!

221
00:24:13,110 --> 00:24:17,720
Catch the real thief. Until then, you're the culprit.

222
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:21,590
Wow, you have a talent in making others speechless.

223
00:24:21,590 --> 00:24:25,550
Save your compliments. You'll continue to be surprised.

224
00:24:25,550 --> 00:24:29,260
Why do I have to meet something like you again—

225
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:30,820
How will you do that?

226
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:32,600
I'm His Majesty the King's nephew!

227
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:35,520
I'm His Majesty the King's younger brother!

228
00:24:36,890 --> 00:24:41,020
Tomorrow at the hour of the snake (9 AM -11 AM). Come in front of the sign at Dongjeokjun Village.

229
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,560
W-why?

230
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,200
You asked me to catch the thief!

231
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:49,590
In exchange for that, there will be no marriage.

232
00:24:53,500 --> 00:24:57,670
Don't forget, the hour of the snake (9 AM -11 AM). In front of the sign at Dongjeokjun Village.

233
00:24:57,670 --> 00:25:02,440
And one more thing. Bird-poop, your words were quite strange.

234
00:25:02,440 --> 00:25:05,110
Just use your countrified dialect.

235
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:17,200
Did you obediently come along to refuse the marriage so rudely?

236
00:25:17,260 --> 00:25:22,300
You were the one who brought me here without revealing the reason, Mother.

237
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:25,690
Until when will you remain this cross?

238
00:25:34,790 --> 00:25:36,950
Eat first.

239
00:25:46,660 --> 00:25:50,620
Scold me first. I don't need to get indigestion while I'm eating.

240
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:53,470
You wench!

241
00:25:53,470 --> 00:25:55,980
Do you know how startled I was earlier?

242
00:25:55,980 --> 00:25:57,900
Mother! Mother!

243
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:00,570
I told you to remain at the house in Geochang.

244
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,100
I told you that I would go down soon!

245
00:26:03,100 --> 00:26:04,140
Oh, my back...

246
00:26:04,140 --> 00:26:06,750
When were you planning to come? After I got married?

247
00:26:06,750 --> 00:26:10,540
You wench, what good did you do?! Come here!

248
00:26:10,540 --> 00:26:14,930
So ... are you now claiming that you did nothing wrong?

249
00:26:14,930 --> 00:26:17,370
It wasn't enough that you left home and came to Hanyang alone.

250
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:19,920
You created a scene in Her Highness the Queen Dowager's presence.

251
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:22,120
My Lord.

252
00:26:22,120 --> 00:26:25,230
Immediately return to the house in Geochang tomorrow.

253
00:26:25,230 --> 00:26:28,710
The marriage with Grand Prince Jin Seong will be canceled.

254
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:31,500
Why?

255
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:34,850
Because I'm not qualified to marry His Highness the Grand Prince?

256
00:26:34,850 --> 00:26:40,010
Because I might become a nuisance to our household if I marry into the royal family?

257
00:26:40,010 --> 00:26:45,410
- Chae Gyeong!
- That Young Master, His Highness the Grand Prince, is much worse than I am!

258
00:26:45,410 --> 00:26:49,790
He sneak peeks at women's naked bodies, pickpockets, and is a gangster that gets angry at everything—

259
00:26:49,790 --> 00:26:53,290
You rascal! How dare you speak of such insolent things?!

260
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:57,520
Even if you grew up doing whatever you wanted without knowledge of laws nor etiquette!

261
00:26:57,520 --> 00:27:00,970
You didn't teach me.

262
00:27:00,970 --> 00:27:05,940
Because you were embarrassed of me, all you did was hide me in the countryside.

263
00:27:09,780 --> 00:27:13,150
I wished to get love and recognition from others,

264
00:27:13,150 --> 00:27:21,260
but you've never even given me a chance to do anything for you and Mother, for our family.

265
00:27:29,040 --> 00:27:32,180
I'll give you that chance now.

266
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:38,650
Tomorrow, quietly return to the house in Geochang.

267
00:28:01,170 --> 00:28:06,190
Shouldn't we at least tell her the reason?

268
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:13,420
Do you think she'll believe the prophecy as to why you cannot become close to members of the royal family?

269
00:28:13,420 --> 00:28:20,160
Rather, she'll believe that we made up an explanation to send her back to the house in Geochang.

270
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:44,510
Why would His Majesty the King kill you?

271
00:28:44,510 --> 00:28:46,390
I know, right?

272
00:28:48,350 --> 00:28:50,160
What time is it now?

273
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:53,030
It's almost the hour of the pig.
(9 PM - 11 PM)

274
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,290
It's a bullseye!

275
00:29:08,290 --> 00:29:14,370
Family should live together and die together.

276
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:21,020
Why must I do that? I trust you, Hyungnim.

277
00:29:23,030 --> 00:29:25,990
It's a bullseye!

278
00:29:26,670 --> 00:29:31,810
My strongest backing is you, Hyungnim.

279
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:37,750
Oh my!

280
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:57,050
Did you wait for me?

281
00:29:58,250 --> 00:30:00,950
I came to give you an answer.

282
00:30:03,430 --> 00:30:08,520
It doesn't matter who it is, even if it's the butcher's daughter.

283
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:14,560
But I will not wed Chief Royal Secretary Sin Soo Geun's daughter

284
00:30:15,790 --> 00:30:20,620
as it would seem as if I'm begging for my life because I distrust you.

285
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:28,060
Aren't you afraid of me?

286
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:31,320
I could have killed you just now.

287
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,570
You won't.

288
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:40,550
However, I know that I am someone you cannot welcome.

289
00:30:40,550 --> 00:30:46,640
Therefore, it's fine if I never wed and die a bachelor.

290
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,800
If you order me to, I won't ever become an adult either.

291
00:30:54,710 --> 00:30:59,930
I'll live just as your younger brother.

292
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:12,110
I haven't been able to sleep for a few days. I'm tired.

293
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:20,000
Will you play your pipa (Chinese lute)?

294
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:25,650
Your lute skills that can crazily bring forth sleep

295
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:28,820
will be quite helpful for my insomnia.

296
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:04,370
Did you say you would live your entire life as my younger brother, nothing more?

297
00:32:04,370 --> 00:32:08,420
You'll have to put forth your best efforts to prove those words.

298
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:14,300
I'm also trying my best not to kill you, to protect you.

299
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:17,360
I am putting forth my best effort.

300
00:32:27,780 --> 00:32:32,100
Immediately return to the house in Geochang tomorrow.

301
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,400
I'm going to seduce him.

302
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:36,700
Goodness, you scared me. Seduce?

303
00:32:36,700 --> 00:32:40,740
Yes. I'll do whatever it takes to marry that Grand Prince or Young Master or whatever,

304
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:45,140
and settle down here. I'm going to remain next to Mother and Father.

305
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,590
But, how?

306
00:32:51,460 --> 00:32:55,700
Due to the Heaven's help, I made a promise with that gangster-like Young Master earlier.

307
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:58,320
Tomorrow morning, Dong—

308
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,440
We decided to meet in the village of Dong-Dong-Dong.

309
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:08,630
Young Lady—

310
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:13,030
Prepare the prettiest clothes, the prettiest shoes, and the most extravagant palanquin.

311
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:17,930
Tomorrow, I'll use my most appealing charms for him.

312
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:23,830
So, um... Clothes and shoes can transform a person,

313
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:25,610
but only up to a certain limit—

314
00:33:25,610 --> 00:33:28,470
Nanny! Do you not believe in me? Are you ashamed of me?

315
00:33:28,470 --> 00:33:32,010
Goodness, no. Of course not.

316
00:33:32,010 --> 00:33:35,840
What are you going to do if he doesn't show up? What if he doesn't keep his promise?

317
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:49,840
Don't ever show your temper.

318
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:54,560
Be as feminine as possible.

319
00:34:16,330 --> 00:34:23,090
Ahjussi! Let me down! Ahjussi, let me down! Ahjussi!

320
00:34:34,140 --> 00:34:39,400
What is this? It's morning but there's no house with smoke rising from its chimney.

321
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,360
Why is the neighborhood so quiet?

322
00:34:43,800 --> 00:34:47,000
Dong Jeok Jeon [T/N: farmland set aside by the king to showcase farming methods and perform rituals]

323
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:51,160
Tomorrow at the hour of the snake (9 AM -11 AM). Come in front of the jungja (gazebo) at Dongjeokjun Village.

324
00:34:59,900 --> 00:35:05,090
Yeah, let's just find the thief for her. Just wait, Bird-poop.

325
00:35:05,090 --> 00:35:09,300
After today, our relationship is over! Over!

326
00:35:10,870 --> 00:35:12,390
What is this?

327
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:15,700
- Come here!
- I said it's not me!

328
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:16,960
- Come here!
- We'll know when we get there.

329
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,120
What evidence? I said it's not me!

330
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:22,110
- Come on!
- I'm telling you, it's a misunderstanding!

331
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:31,070
Make them all kneel!

332
00:35:31,070 --> 00:35:35,190
You people should know better! No matter how hungry you are,

333
00:35:35,190 --> 00:35:41,230
how could you touch the rice meant as a present for His Majesty the King?

334
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:46,160
Before your family and our entire village gets in trouble, turn yourselves in!

335
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:48,840
Chief, it's not me!

336
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:51,300
Look here! It's not me, it's not!

337
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:54,510
Then with what rice did you cook your breakfast this morning?

338
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:58,700
I'm sure the culprit is among the houses who had smoke rising out of their chimneys this morning.

339
00:35:58,700 --> 00:36:01,660
I saw the smoke rising from your house!

340
00:36:01,660 --> 00:36:05,630
- Me too, me too!
- Be quiet for a minute!

341
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:08,110
Why did you do something so useless?

342
00:36:08,110 --> 00:36:09,840
When people are watching—

343
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:13,000
Don't do anything, don't see anything, don't hear anything!

344
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,660
Yes, I know.

345
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:19,990
We've been starving for three days! Please!

346
00:36:19,990 --> 00:36:24,300
- That's not my problem!
- I really don't know what this is all about.

347
00:36:24,300 --> 00:36:26,530
This is your young nephew, isn't it?

348
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,470
Come here, you rascal!

349
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:34,330
Now, now, now! If you're caught stealing the rice meant for the king, you'll be beheaded immediately.

350
00:36:34,330 --> 00:36:36,790
They'll be beheaded?

351
00:36:36,790 --> 00:36:38,830
You're here, Bird-poop.

352
00:36:42,430 --> 00:36:43,700
Let's go.

353
00:36:43,700 --> 00:36:45,810
Where?! They're going to die!

354
00:36:45,810 --> 00:36:48,390
Because they stole the rice meant to be offered to His Majesty the King.

355
00:36:48,390 --> 00:36:51,130
Is that a crime worthy of death?

356
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:52,700
The justice will judge that.

357
00:36:52,700 --> 00:36:57,540
Are you blind? Can't you see that field? It's completely ruined!

358
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:02,290
Since the field is in that state because of the drought, the people in this village can't be worried about the rice meant for the king.

359
00:37:02,290 --> 00:37:04,800
It's obvious they haven't even been able to eat vegetables.

360
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:10,070
They'll kill someone because they couldn't deliver the rice offering?

361
00:37:10,070 --> 00:37:13,400
Even a child like him?

362
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,510
Is the drought my fault? Don't mind it.

363
00:37:19,510 --> 00:37:22,800
You won't apologize even if I ask you to nor will you concede if I ask you to.

364
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:26,300
Why were you born if you weren't going to do anything?! Huh?

365
00:37:26,300 --> 00:37:31,690
I don't even know those people! They're strangers! On top of that, he's the one who stole your silk pouch.

366
00:37:31,690 --> 00:37:33,870
Then he's not a complete stranger!

367
00:37:33,870 --> 00:37:37,110
What are you doing? Let's drag them to the Investigation Bureau.

368
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:41,340
- Huh? What is this?
- What is that?

369
00:37:41,340 --> 00:37:45,630
- Hey, you rascal!
- Where did you get the money to buy this medicine?

370
00:37:45,630 --> 00:37:48,400
He's the culprit.

371
00:37:50,610 --> 00:37:53,510
- Let go of me! Let go!
- Come on, let's go!

372
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:56,540
- What's wrong with you?! Stop, stop!
- Move!

373
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:06,710
I know the culprit!

374
00:38:08,440 --> 00:38:11,710
Your Highness the Grand Prince, what are you planning to do?

375
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:18,650
- His Highness the Grand Prince?
- Grand Prince? Are you truly His Highness the Grand Prince?

376
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,910
Yes, I am. I am Grand Prince Jin Seong.

377
00:38:27,500 --> 00:38:30,610
We greet Your Highness the Grand Prince!

378
00:38:30,610 --> 00:38:34,280
Forget that. Oh, that rice storage!

379
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:38,570
To steal rice from there without garnering the attention of the people on guard, you have to cross that field.

380
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:43,430
As you all poured manure fertilizer on the field due to the lack of rain, the entire field is sticky.

381
00:38:43,430 --> 00:38:46,380
Whoever has dirt on their shoes is the culprit.

382
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:50,180
Therefore, I am the culprit.

383
00:38:50,180 --> 00:38:51,920
- Huh?
- Nonsense.

384
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:58,020
- What nonsense? That doesn't make sense!
- What do you lack that you would steal rice?

385
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:03,350
If you don't believe me, there should be a withered branch of a peach tree nearby.

386
00:39:03,350 --> 00:39:05,990
Look for it. I dropped it without knowing because I was too busy stealing the rice.

387
00:39:05,990 --> 00:39:08,370
What are you doing?! Hurry up and look for it!

388
00:39:08,370 --> 00:39:10,790
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Go!

389
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:14,570
Over there, right there, there!

390
00:39:14,570 --> 00:39:18,570
Goodness, I found it! I found it!

391
00:39:18,570 --> 00:39:20,880
Look at this! It's here!

392
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:24,690
- Is that a withered branch of a peach tree?
- Yes, it is!

393
00:39:24,690 --> 00:39:28,490
From what I know, just as there is no such case where a slave may report their master,

394
00:39:28,490 --> 00:39:33,050
it's quite a complicated process for someone of a lower status to report someone of a higher status.

395
00:39:33,050 --> 00:39:36,570
Aside from the charge of treason, if you complicate the lines of class and status,

396
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:39,120
you will be punished for violating the code of morals.

397
00:39:39,120 --> 00:39:42,590
Violating the code of morals?

398
00:39:42,590 --> 00:39:47,730
Will you report me? Or will you accept the rice I'll give you in compensation and end the matter here?

399
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,440
How could we dare to report you, Your Highness?

400
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,760
As long as you compensate for the rice, we'll pretend this never happened.

401
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,420
- Yes, yes, of course.
- Of course.

402
00:39:59,420 --> 00:40:02,080
They said that we only need to compensate them for the rice.

403
00:40:06,900 --> 00:40:09,500
So you're going to pin this on me now, huh?

404
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:12,390
Let's see how you settle it.

405
00:40:12,390 --> 00:40:14,570
The thing is...

406
00:40:16,030 --> 00:40:18,190
Let's sell that!

407
00:40:21,410 --> 00:40:24,150
- Is she insane?
- What to do?

408
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:30,890
- Thank you so much! Thank you.
- Thank you so much, thank you!

409
00:40:30,890 --> 00:40:32,900
Come on, quickly.

410
00:40:32,900 --> 00:40:36,240
Your Highness, thank you so much!

411
00:40:36,240 --> 00:40:39,850
If it weren't for Your Highness, we would have been in great trouble.

412
00:40:39,850 --> 00:40:43,340
Goodness! If we had gone to the Investigative Bureau like this, we would have been locked in cells

413
00:40:43,340 --> 00:40:48,040
- and been on our way to the afterlife. Thank you so much!
- Thank you!

414
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:48,840
Rice...

415
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:51,610
- Yes, of course. Thank you.
- Thank you, thank you!

416
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:55,310
- Thank you, Your Highness! Thank you!
- Thank you!

417
00:40:55,310 --> 00:40:58,300
There's more rice aside from what we filled the storage with,

418
00:40:58,300 --> 00:41:00,950
so make sure you have rice for today's meals.

419
00:41:00,950 --> 00:41:05,870
The rich Grand Prince is giving you this, so you don't have to decline.

420
00:41:06,680 --> 00:41:10,820
Our village is also worried about the drought.

421
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:14,030
Next time, we'll be holding a rain ritual.

422
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:17,880
Is it easy to pacify the Heavens? It's extremely—
(said in Gyeongsangdo dialect)

423
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:21,450
It's very difficult, isn't it?

424
00:41:58,610 --> 00:42:00,500
Isn't he the son of the Deposed Queen?

425
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:04,710
If he ascends the throne, a huge catastrophe will fall upon the nation!

426
00:42:04,710 --> 00:42:07,190
Your Majesty! Please leave a will!

427
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:10,550
Appoint Grand Prince Jin Seong as the crown prince.

428
00:42:12,790 --> 00:42:17,890
Please do not forget my daughter, Your Majesty!

429
00:42:18,560 --> 00:42:21,630
It's your mother, Your Majesty!

430
00:42:26,970 --> 00:42:29,030
Joseon will fall because of you.

431
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:33,930
Thank you for your blessings. I will become a good and wise king.

432
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:08,650
Immediately!

433
00:43:08,650 --> 00:43:10,770
Head Eunuch!

434
00:43:13,310 --> 00:43:17,480
- Your Majesty.
- Burn it. I won't wear that ever again!

435
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:21,510
Yes, Your Majesty. I will bring you a new one.

436
00:44:14,630 --> 00:44:18,570
I messed up! Forget about being feminine.

437
00:44:20,710 --> 00:44:23,590
What are you murmuring to yourself?

438
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:27,280
No, well...

439
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:36,410
But, why did you change your mind?

440
00:44:36,410 --> 00:44:40,750
Then, is there someone who will stand idly by after being asked "Why were you born?"

441
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,110
That was because of the situation—

442
00:44:46,950 --> 00:44:52,750
Still, if you're born, shouldn't you do your lot in life?

443
00:44:52,750 --> 00:44:57,410
Moreover, since you were born with a very high social status,

444
00:44:57,410 --> 00:45:02,080
you'll do more precious and meaningful things.

445
00:45:03,620 --> 00:45:05,940
- Me?
- Yes.

446
00:45:05,940 --> 00:45:11,030
Look at what you did earlier. You know you saved his life.

447
00:45:15,440 --> 00:45:17,950
Still, what will change?

448
00:45:17,950 --> 00:45:21,820
Even though I saved that scaredy cat, he doesn't even show a trace of himself.

449
00:45:21,840 --> 00:45:25,430
Eight! Nine!

450
00:45:25,430 --> 00:45:28,050
- One moment.
- Ten!

451
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:35,270
You ignorant rascal.

452
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:37,590
- Let's go.
- Give it to me.

453
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:39,500
You said you'd give it back if I got hit ten times.

454
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:42,920
But, how did you know he was the criminal?

455
00:45:42,920 --> 00:45:46,050
Then what about Your Highness?

456
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:48,530
I saw him that day.

457
00:45:48,530 --> 00:45:52,230
I come to this neighborhood often so I pretty much know every kid.

458
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:57,320
There are a lot of kids who get pressured from neighborhood bullies to do that.

459
00:46:06,280 --> 00:46:08,250
What? Why are you looking at me like that?

460
00:46:08,250 --> 00:46:13,380
It's unexpected, but you have a lot of interest in people.

461
00:46:13,380 --> 00:46:17,030
But why do you usually pretend otherwise?

462
00:46:18,060 --> 00:46:20,630
By any chance, are you preparing to get married?

463
00:46:20,630 --> 00:46:23,850
- What?
- I mean, look.

464
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:27,270
Pretending not to have seen, not being able to hear. You also keep your mouth closed.

465
00:46:27,270 --> 00:46:30,690
I've heard in order to survive, women have to live like that once they are married.

466
00:46:30,690 --> 00:46:34,250
What you're doing is exactly that.

467
00:46:36,290 --> 00:46:42,110
You're right. They say that's how you survive. That's also true for me.

468
00:46:51,400 --> 00:46:55,420
Thank you. I'm grateful.

469
00:47:00,480 --> 00:47:02,490
I'll return it to you.

470
00:47:12,540 --> 00:47:17,080
You said "so what will change?" It changes like this.

471
00:47:18,340 --> 00:47:23,400
I thought you were a scaredy cat. You do have a conscience after all.

472
00:47:24,050 --> 00:47:26,880
You got beaten up in order to get this back?

473
00:47:29,900 --> 00:47:32,020
Is that true?

474
00:47:32,020 --> 00:47:36,360
I don't have anything to give to Your Highness, so I will give you my life.

475
00:47:36,360 --> 00:47:39,080
I will die on your behalf!

476
00:47:40,170 --> 00:47:43,430
Hey, why are you putting your life on the line for something like that?

477
00:47:43,430 --> 00:47:47,480
Since you saved my life, I will repay you with my life.

478
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:51,460
Thank you, Your Highness! Thank you, Young Lady!

479
00:47:51,460 --> 00:47:55,930
Oh, whatever. Do as you wish.

480
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:05,560
Then, instead of saying we'll do our lot in life, shall we be friends?

481
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:11,650
Who? Him, you, and me?

482
00:48:13,610 --> 00:48:15,390
Your joke goes too far, Bird-poop.

483
00:48:15,390 --> 00:48:18,830
I mean, it's nice to be friends.

484
00:48:18,830 --> 00:48:23,170
Your Highness the Grand Prince will be proud of yourself as you look at this boy.

485
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:28,590
He will self-reflect on today's events and won't commit crimes anymore.

486
00:48:28,590 --> 00:48:34,860
As for me, if I have friends in Hanyang, I'll have an excuse to visit.

487
00:48:34,860 --> 00:48:39,230
Why do you want to be friends over that? It only tarnishes your class.

488
00:48:39,260 --> 00:48:41,330
Are you really the daughter of the Chief Royal Secretary?

489
00:48:41,330 --> 00:48:44,010
Are you really the niece of the Queen Consort?

490
00:48:47,960 --> 00:48:52,940
Why are you bring up jokbo ( family lineage) over this matter? What are you going to do if I'm not?

491
00:48:52,940 --> 00:48:58,320
You're right, everyone has a birth secret and I'm an ugly duckling!

492
00:48:58,320 --> 00:49:00,220
Young Lady.

493
00:49:03,570 --> 00:49:08,480
I should go to Geochang and get married to the twice removed nephew of the school principal!

494
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:14,160
Goodbye. This is my final day in Hanyang.

495
00:49:16,320 --> 00:49:22,010
If I made friends in Hanyang, I wanted to visit using that as an excuse. I'm in big trouble.

496
00:49:22,850 --> 00:49:27,180
Of course, Grand Prince, it would make you feel ashamed to be my friend.

497
00:49:36,250 --> 00:49:39,200
I, Grand Prince Jin Seong, and Sin Chae Gyeong...

498
00:49:42,380 --> 00:49:44,410
I'm Seo No.

499
00:49:45,020 --> 00:49:47,360
I, Lee Yeok, Sin Chae Gyeong, and Seo No,

500
00:49:47,360 --> 00:49:51,740
I swear to the Heavens that from this day forward, the three of us will be friends.

501
00:49:53,390 --> 00:49:56,100
What are you doing? Aren't you going to do it?

502
00:49:58,120 --> 00:50:02,430
I swear, to the Heavens without a trace of shame,

503
00:50:02,430 --> 00:50:05,520
I will become a sincere friend.

504
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,200
What are you doing, not doing your part?

505
00:50:07,200 --> 00:50:09,330
I swear!

506
00:50:15,080 --> 00:50:20,700
But, is it okay to do it with just words like this? Without having something like a ceremony?

507
00:50:20,700 --> 00:50:24,830
Among girls, we each tell a secret of ours.

508
00:50:24,830 --> 00:50:27,200
By doing so, we became friends really quickly.

509
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:28,640
Forget it.

510
00:50:56,630 --> 00:51:00,330
I'll tell either the eunuchs or the Head Palace Lady

511
00:51:00,330 --> 00:51:05,520
to ensure these scented candles will not burn out, even while you sleep.

512
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:08,330
It'll help you not to have nightmares.

513
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,270
You still haven't found it?

514
00:51:18,270 --> 00:51:21,050
I apologize, Your Majesty.

515
00:51:21,050 --> 00:51:23,880
Please just wait a bit more.

516
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:28,650
You must find the secret order and dispose of it so I can sleep in peace!

517
00:51:29,790 --> 00:51:33,670
Don't you know of another proper method aside from these scented candles?!

518
00:51:50,790 --> 00:51:56,030
Rather, I wish I could just faint now, like before.

519
00:52:00,450 --> 00:52:03,090
This is our house.

520
00:52:03,090 --> 00:52:06,880
My father took my grandmother to the physician's house for acupuncture.

521
00:52:15,540 --> 00:52:19,070
If you think it won't work, don't be pathetic and hang onto him.

522
00:52:19,070 --> 00:52:21,450
Come back home without turning back.

523
00:52:21,450 --> 00:52:25,550
If you say "Let's remain friends then" or something along those lines...

524
00:52:25,550 --> 00:52:30,550
If you hang onto him and throw away your pride like that, it'll be quite pathetic.

525
00:52:30,550 --> 00:52:32,680
Do you understand?

526
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:35,950
Is this time for me care about whether I look pathetic or not?

527
00:52:59,950 --> 00:53:02,920
Bird-poop, you have no friends, right?

528
00:53:02,920 --> 00:53:07,330
You've been waiting for friends to do this because you were envious of other kids doing this, aren't you?

529
00:53:07,330 --> 00:53:11,540
What are you saying?! I've done this plenty of times!

530
00:53:11,540 --> 00:53:16,380
Oh well, I'll accept to be fooled to celebrate the start our friendship.

531
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:22,130
For me, it's this.

532
00:53:22,130 --> 00:53:25,700
This! That!

533
00:53:25,700 --> 00:53:27,490
Hey!

534
00:53:40,690 --> 00:53:43,430
Even though it looks like this, it's Mencius.

535
00:53:43,430 --> 00:53:46,250
This is the most difficult book among Confucian writings.

536
00:53:46,250 --> 00:53:48,420
The reason I made it look like an erotic novel is because—

537
00:53:48,420 --> 00:53:50,220
- It's obvious.
- It's obvious.

538
00:53:50,220 --> 00:53:54,210
It's because council members and the royal family don't want me to study!

539
00:53:54,210 --> 00:53:56,450
- That's an excuse.
- No way.

540
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:00,050
I've read more scriptures than His Majesty the King!

541
00:54:05,670 --> 00:54:09,280
But, why aren't you allowed to study?

542
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,780
It's good to be smart.

543
00:54:11,780 --> 00:54:14,140
That's because...

544
00:54:14,140 --> 00:54:15,880
Wait!

545
00:54:44,830 --> 00:54:48,110
Is it because you're scared or because of the smell?

546
00:54:48,110 --> 00:54:49,670
Both!

547
00:54:49,670 --> 00:54:54,980
If you're scared, I'll stand guard here. Your nose will get used to the smell soon.

548
00:54:56,420 --> 00:54:58,660
You're being serious, right?

549
00:54:58,660 --> 00:55:02,290
Go inside quickly and deal with nature's call!

550
00:55:26,310 --> 00:55:28,370
Bird-poop, is it you?

551
00:55:30,010 --> 00:55:32,350
If it's not me, who else would it be?

552
00:55:32,350 --> 00:55:35,780
I whistle like this when I'm scared

553
00:55:35,780 --> 00:55:39,060
because it makes my heart settle down.

554
00:56:13,690 --> 00:56:16,350
Why do I feel she's reliable because of such a thing?

555
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:50,940
We've finally found him, Your Majesty.

556
00:56:52,670 --> 00:56:59,450
The scribe who worked the night shift at the palace during the final moments of the late king.

557
00:56:59,450 --> 00:57:06,170
He's been living in Dongjukjeon Village, in the outskirts of Dongdaemun, hiding his identity.

558
00:57:06,170 --> 00:57:10,090
- Did you place someone to follow him?
- Yes.

559
00:57:10,090 --> 00:57:14,890
I've ordered someone to watch him in secrecy.

560
00:57:17,090 --> 00:57:24,080
After the rain ritual, bring him in front of me as I will gladly meet him.

561
00:57:24,080 --> 00:57:26,030
Yes, Your Majesty.

562
00:57:26,970 --> 00:57:34,650
However, the Queen Dowager's movements are quite strange.

563
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,020
Just yesterday afternoon,

564
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:44,150
Her Highness the Queen Dowager left the palace with His Highness the Grand Prince Jin Seong

565
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:47,030
without making her destination public.

566
00:57:48,220 --> 00:57:55,940
She must be looking for a method to protect her precious son from me.

567
00:57:55,940 --> 00:58:01,590
The most certain method would be the secret order,

568
00:58:02,310 --> 00:58:07,130
the will the late Majesty left behind.

569
00:58:08,910 --> 00:58:11,110
What do you mean?

570
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:16,060
What if the Queen Dowager is also aware of the secret order?

571
00:58:16,060 --> 00:58:20,820
What if, like us, she's attempting to find the scribe to secure the secret order?

572
00:58:20,820 --> 00:58:23,270
So we must find it first!

573
00:58:23,270 --> 00:58:26,550
We must find it as soon as possible and dispose of it.

574
00:58:28,050 --> 00:58:30,450
Just the secret order?

575
00:58:32,660 --> 00:58:37,670
Do you think it will end just because you dispose of the secret order?

576
00:59:51,310 --> 00:59:56,600
The more she reveals about herself, the more interesting she becomes.

577
00:59:56,600 --> 00:59:59,430
You won't apologize when I ask you to nor will you concede when I ask you to.

578
00:59:59,430 --> 01:00:03,200
If you're not going to do anything, then why were you born?!

579
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:08,450
Still, if you're born into this world, shouldn't you do you part?

580
01:00:08,450 --> 01:00:13,730
Then instead of saying we'll do our lot in life, shall we be friends?

581
01:00:13,730 --> 01:00:15,060
I swear!

582
01:00:15,060 --> 01:00:20,910
I swear to the Heavens, without any trace of shame, that I'll become a sincere friend!

583
01:00:41,950 --> 01:00:43,880
The thing is...

584
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,960
I've thought about this quite a bit.

585
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:58,470
No matter how much I think, I must marry you, Your Highness.
