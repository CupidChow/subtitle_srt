1
00:00:48,230 --> 00:00:50,330
Proceed!

2
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:57,660
Father!
 Episode 17 
[Geum Oh Moon: Main gate of the Royal Investigative Bureau]

3
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:00,630
Chae Gyeong!

4
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,360
Why are you here?

5
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:08,060
Why did you come back? I told you to never come back no matter what happens.

6
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,490
Did you send us away in a rush like that to do this?

7
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:14,550
They gave out rice to the people struggling with the famine.

8
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,770
Based on information collected from various sources,

9
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:20,190
they only exposed illegal activities of corrupted influential officials.

10
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:24,890
Even if they might have had plans beyond that, they didn't even go there.

11
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:27,120
They were going to disband.

12
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:29,330
If I had not done it,

13
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:34,080
His Majesty would have fallen into a deeper abyss of suspicion and a sense of betrayal.

14
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:36,720
The king has already crossed the line.

15
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:43,890
However, you are defending him just because he's the liege.

16
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:51,500
Is it because of me?

17
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:57,020
All of this, is it to summon me and the Grand Prince?

18
00:02:00,310 --> 00:02:02,350
Chae Gyeong!

19
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:05,340
First Vice Premier! We have a big problem!

20
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,100
Your Highness, Grand Prince!

21
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,720
Chae Gyeong.

22
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:23,790
She is the wife of a traitor. Capture her.

23
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:25,430
- What do you mean a traitor?
- Release me.

24
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:27,090
What is this about, Grand Prince?

25
00:02:27,090 --> 00:02:29,830
Get your hands off of her this instant!

26
00:02:29,830 --> 00:02:33,480
Imprison Grand Prince Jin Seong in the Royal Investigative Bureau,

27
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:36,630
and take his wife to Dangjikcheong by the Palace Gate.

28
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:38,290
Yes.

29
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,380
- Grand Prince.
- No. Let me go.

30
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:42,390
- Grand Prince!
- Let me go.

31
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:45,000
Don't believe what anyone says. I didn't do anything, Chae Gyeong!

32
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,020
Grand Prince! Grand Prince!

33
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:50,720
- Chae Gyeong!
- Release me!

34
00:02:51,790 --> 00:02:55,410
What is all this? What are you plotting?

35
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:59,600
Just now, Grand Prince Jin Seong tried to kill His Majesty.

36
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:02,360
Yet you are still so confident.

37
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:05,530
Can't you understand what's going on?

38
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,490
- Take her.
- Yes.

39
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:41,100
- Hyungnim!
- Your Majesty! It's treason.

40
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:48,950
Goodbye, younger brother.

41
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:52,130
You

42
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:57,170
intend to kill me.

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:04:01,440
In the end, you

44
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,640
plan to kill me.

45
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:21,080
However, since you haven't kept your promise, you will end up paying the price.

46
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,970
Don't believe what anyone says. I haven't done anything, Chae Gyeong.

47
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:33,330
Your Majesty. Is this the price you talked about?

48
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:38,240
How is His Majesty? What exactly happened?

49
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,370
Your Majesty. What is all this?

50
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,570
I rushed over here after hearing you collapsed after being attacked—

51
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:03,600
Why? Are you taken aback because I seem to be better than you expected?

52
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:11,470
All of this happened because you people were not able to properly capture Grand Prince Jin Seong.

53
00:05:11,470 --> 00:05:13,530
Thus, I personally

54
00:05:13,530 --> 00:05:19,300
created for you the justification and evidence to catch the traitor.

55
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:23,440
Your Majesty. By chance—

56
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:27,960
You can no longer say such things as "there is no justification" or "there is not enough evidence"

57
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,460
to kill Grand Prince Jin Seong. Don't you agree, First Vice Premier?

58
00:05:35,330 --> 00:05:41,170
Why are you looking at me like that?

59
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:50,400
Why are you looking at me with such contempt?

60
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,810
You, of all people,

61
00:05:52,810 --> 00:05:56,220
how can you look at me with those eyes?

62
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:00,280
Is your body unharmed?

63
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:04,050
I don't want to listen to you. Leave right away!

64
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,000
This happened because you deceived me and failed to fulfill your responsibility.

65
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,900
You should be held accountable for it.

66
00:06:14,760 --> 00:06:19,850
Resign from your government post right away and go to your private residence. You'll be put under house arrest.

67
00:06:21,310 --> 00:06:26,430
You will not be able to leave home without my permission.

68
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,710
I will follow your royal order.

69
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,140
I have to go to the Royal Investigative Bureau right away!

70
00:06:57,140 --> 00:06:58,400
Your Highness, Queen Dowager.

71
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,500
Please calm down. Guards at the Royal Investigative Bureau have forbidden anyone from entering or exiting.

72
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,900
How dare they block me! How dare they!

73
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,100
Your Highness, Queen Dowager.

74
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,730
It can't be. He must have been framed.

75
00:07:14,730 --> 00:07:19,770
Yeok would never have acted so recklessly!

76
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,540
Your Majesty, please reconsider this matter!

77
00:07:26,540 --> 00:07:34,580
Your Majesty, please remember your brotherly affection and spare his life!

78
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:37,440
That is so, Your Majesty.

79
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,030
Members of the royal family cannot be sentenced to a death penalty...

80
00:07:42,030 --> 00:07:48,560
You all are trying so hard. No one is even listening.

81
00:08:03,970 --> 00:08:06,380
Mother.

82
00:08:07,970 --> 00:08:10,270
Royal order? Royal order?

83
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:13,530
Since you're in front of me wielding a sword,

84
00:08:13,530 --> 00:08:15,590
my blood is boiling.

85
00:08:15,590 --> 00:08:20,010
It's treason! Grand Prince Jin Seong is trying to kill His Majesty!

86
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:05,940
How is it? My acting.

87
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:20,190
Do you want to ask why I am taking it this far?

88
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:24,540
I needed justification to properly kill you.

89
00:09:24,540 --> 00:09:27,520
So I could kill you properly in the eyes of the world,

90
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:33,940
so no one will mention your name to me again.

91
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,560
I needed a definitive way to eliminate you.

92
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:41,780
Try to cover the sky with the palm of your hands.

93
00:09:41,780 --> 00:09:46,150
Because you do that, do you think my existence will disappear?

94
00:09:46,150 --> 00:09:50,160
How can you do such a cruel act? How?

95
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:57,710
Now I will never, ever forgive you again, Hyungnim!

96
00:09:58,510 --> 00:10:00,790
Forgive?

97
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:06,740
How laughable. Who said you will even be given a chance to do so?

98
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:11,570
I will soon end your life.

99
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:16,180
As soon as the day breaks, I will have you executed

100
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:19,770
and have you dismembered.

101
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:22,740
You must kill me.

102
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:25,070
If you don't,

103
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:29,620
I will end up killing you.

104
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:36,780
You're still the same. You're only a powerless younger brother of the king, who can't do anything.

105
00:10:36,780 --> 00:10:42,950
You only have a powerful glare and voice to talk back to me.

106
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:47,820
Just how many more times do you need to die in order to grow up?

107
00:11:05,240 --> 00:11:08,260
Your Majesty. Good job.

108
00:11:08,260 --> 00:11:10,930
Grand Prince Jin Seong is trouble that should have been rooted out earlier—

109
00:11:10,930 --> 00:11:14,180
Where is Chae Gyeong?

110
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:18,590
Oh yes. She's in Dangjikcheong.

111
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:26,390
How is she?

112
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:31,030
She seems out of it, and she's hasn't moved an inch the whole night.

113
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:35,620
She's not even able to keep water down. She spits it all out.

114
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,690
Your Majesty.

115
00:11:57,690 --> 00:12:00,470
You are the wife of a traitor,

116
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:04,120
and you dare try to do as you please!

117
00:12:04,810 --> 00:12:09,630
Until I make the decision to forgive you or kill you,

118
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:15,180
you won't be able to live or die as you please while you're here.

119
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:17,360
Your Majesty.

120
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:22,290
That's the punishment that I'm bestowing upon you.

121
00:12:22,290 --> 00:12:25,900
Please kill me instead.

122
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:28,110
Don't you think that's too easy?

123
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:33,320
After you watch your husband die, I will think about it then.

124
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:39,670
I will punish him in front of Soui Gate by dismemberment.

125
00:12:39,670 --> 00:12:41,060
Your Majesty!

126
00:12:41,060 --> 00:12:46,120
What? Are you going to plead with me to spare his life again?

127
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:58,730
Your Majesty. I have become a traitor's wife because of your royal command.

128
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:04,850
You won't be able to say that you're not responsible for any of this, Your Majesty.

129
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:08,780
So, for me and my family

130
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:12,520
I ask of you to help me so my husband won't die as a traitor.

131
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:16,840
Being a traitor is a serious offense that will exterminate three generations.

132
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:21,930
As long as I'm married to the Grand Prince, I and my whole family will

133
00:13:21,930 --> 00:13:25,670
all either become slaves or die in a situation like this, right, Sire?

134
00:13:25,670 --> 00:13:32,110
That's right. You have a point. I'm also responsible for this.

135
00:13:32,110 --> 00:13:33,870
Then what to do?

136
00:13:33,870 --> 00:13:39,300
I don't know in what condition he'll return, if I send him into exile again like the last time.

137
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:50,630
I will be by your side for the rest of my life.

138
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:57,300
As long as I'm held hostage by you,

139
00:13:57,300 --> 00:14:00,930
the Grand Prince won't be able to act carelessly.

140
00:14:00,930 --> 00:14:03,140
Held hostage?

141
00:14:03,870 --> 00:14:07,270
Until you're at ease,

142
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:13,250
even if it will be for the rest of my life, I will remain by your side.

143
00:14:13,250 --> 00:14:16,470
Let's say I do spare your life and believe your promises.

144
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:21,920
But if you end up escaping or he comes to rescue you, then what are you going to do?

145
00:14:23,470 --> 00:14:27,460
Now I'm not able to trust you like I once did.

146
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:30,000
Instead of depending on those measly words,

147
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,760
I will have to take different measures this time.

148
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:39,720
Fine, I think it would be a good idea to punish him by cutting off his tendons.

149
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:46,370
If I cut the tendons off his heels, then it would be difficult for him to take care of himself.

150
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:49,230
So dreaming of treason would be out of the question.

151
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:51,440
Your Majesty.

152
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,840
This is to punish the crime of stealing, so isn't this perfect for Yeok?

153
00:14:56,840 --> 00:14:59,660
Since he tried to steal what's rightfully mine.

154
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:05,400
My position, my woman, and my life.

155
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:13,170
If he doesn't want that either, death is the only answer.

156
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:23,170
Please spare his life.

157
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,840
I understand.

158
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:46,030
How? How will he be able to endure such a cruel punishment?

159
00:15:46,030 --> 00:15:51,390
It's a punishment of cutting off his tendons. It means he will be handicapped for the rest of his life.

160
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:54,540
I think he should try to break out of prison. And if the King changes his mind at this rate,

161
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:57,460
he might try to drag him by the nails instead of cutting off the tendons of his feet.

162
00:15:57,460 --> 00:15:59,420
No, breaking out of jail is a big problem.

163
00:15:59,420 --> 00:16:02,700
The Queen Dowager and the wife of the Grand Prince are living in the palace too.

164
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:08,220
We must find some way to save him.

165
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,670
Chae Gyeong.

166
00:16:36,670 --> 00:16:40,760
Let go! Your Majesty! My wife didn't do anything wrong.

167
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:44,680
Please send my wife back to her chambers!

168
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:50,540
She's the wife of a traitor and that alone makes her a criminal.

169
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:56,540
So she is paying the price by watching you go through this with her own eyes.

170
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:02,900
So that she won't dream of doing any useless things.

171
00:17:04,430 --> 00:17:07,070
Your Majesty!

172
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:14,370
No, Hyungnim! Please spare Chae Gyeong!

173
00:17:14,370 --> 00:17:18,900
This is too cruel for her! Please! Please!

174
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,600
Don't...

175
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:25,460
Go! Leave!

176
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:27,750
What are you going to do?

177
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,970
I will watch.

178
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:41,340
She said that she'll watch.

179
00:17:46,610 --> 00:17:52,480
Lee Yeok has committed a great crime by injuring the King.

180
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:55,310
He is also a direct descendant of the late King.

181
00:17:55,310 --> 00:18:01,260
As a member of the royal family of this nation, he won't be able to receive capital punishment.

182
00:18:01,260 --> 00:18:04,940
So he'll be disciplined by getting his tendons cut off.

183
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:13,840
Proceed.

184
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,930
Your Highness the Grand Prince, please endure it.

185
00:18:27,870 --> 00:18:32,370
I have to watch so I won't forget.

186
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,770
I will remember what happened today.

187
00:18:36,770 --> 00:18:44,510
I will remember the brutality of the King, the Grand Prince's pain, and my foolishness.

188
00:18:46,500 --> 00:18:54,580
Lee Yeok, the criminal will be prohibited from meeting with anyone personally from the royal family.

189
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:57,440
And Lady Shin, who is the wife of the criminal Lee Yeok,

190
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:03,630
will be sent off to a far off royal villa until Lee Yeok proves his loyalty.

191
00:19:03,630 --> 00:19:06,800
Grand Prince Lee Yeok will be stripped of his title.

192
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:10,070
All future descendants will be illegitimate for all eternity

193
00:19:10,070 --> 00:19:14,710
and won't be able to return to the royal palace ever again.

194
00:19:26,500 --> 00:19:28,650
Are you awake now?

195
00:19:28,650 --> 00:19:31,840
Yeok, do you recognize this place?

196
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:34,470
Home.

197
00:19:36,070 --> 00:19:38,030
It's my home.

198
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:44,860
But where is Chae Gyeong?

199
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:51,720
Did she go over to her parents place?

200
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,010
She's in the palace.

201
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:57,640
She's staying in the palace and is held hostage in your place.

202
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,720
She made a deal to do that for saving your life.

203
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:03,450
Who did?

204
00:20:03,450 --> 00:20:05,570
Why?! What for?!!

205
00:20:05,570 --> 00:20:09,070
Yeok. Hey, Yeok.

206
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:33,090
Lady of the House, it's Eunuch Song.

207
00:20:37,680 --> 00:20:40,480
The King has sent this over to you.

208
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:50,230
Just put it there and leave.

209
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:00,620
Tell me...

210
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:05,250
By chance were there any other messages?

211
00:21:05,250 --> 00:21:07,720
From my father or my mother...

212
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:12,240
or perhaps even from the Grand Prince?

213
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:16,510
There haven't been any messages for you.

214
00:21:45,960 --> 00:21:48,020
Chae Gyeong.

215
00:21:48,650 --> 00:21:52,050
Are you awake, my dear husband?

216
00:21:52,050 --> 00:21:54,900
Chae Gyeong, how did you come here?

217
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:59,790
My dear husband is hurt; how can I not come?

218
00:22:12,890 --> 00:22:18,690
♫ You've come to me without making a sound ♫

219
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:22,050
♫ You reached out your hand ♫

220
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:25,130
The wound has healed a lot.

221
00:22:25,130 --> 00:22:27,640
It's a relief.

222
00:22:28,950 --> 00:22:34,000
That's not possible. Look closely.
♫ The time we spent together ♫

223
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,160
I am still in a lot of pain.
♫ Is going far away like a dream ♫

224
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:41,540
That's not your ankle

225
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:44,070
but your heart that's in pain.
♫ I can't stand the longing now which is growing so ♫

226
00:22:44,070 --> 00:22:50,030
For your heartache to get better, you must take me away soon.

227
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:55,840
Are you going to continue to leave me by myself like this?
♫ Why didn't I know loving would be that? ♫

228
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,600
What do you mean leave you by yourself?
♫ I can't do anything else but leave even though I don't want to go ♫

229
00:22:58,600 --> 00:23:01,320
We are together like this.

230
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:04,580
It's because this is a dream.
♫ I know now that  ♫

231
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:07,930
♫ I can't live without you ♫

232
00:23:07,930 --> 00:23:14,310
We are able to be close like this since it's a dream.

233
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,190
No, don't.

234
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:21,070
So, you have to get better soon.

235
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:25,170
No, don't leave, Chae Gyeong. Please? Don't leave.

236
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:35,090
♫ Forever and ever us. ♫

237
00:23:46,060 --> 00:23:48,020
Your Highness.

238
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,520
Are you awake?

239
00:24:01,180 --> 00:24:03,840
Did you have another nightmare?

240
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:09,760
So what if your body is better? Your heart must be stronger.

241
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,550
Eat something.

242
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:19,650
Why are you looking at me like that?

243
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:21,440
You

244
00:24:23,040 --> 00:24:25,590
must really hate me.

245
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,820
Since I am making Chae Gyeong suffer like that.

246
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:33,360
What's the point of talking about it? I really hate you.

247
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,700
Oh my. I can't lie.

248
00:24:35,700 --> 00:24:42,800
Still, you're the only person my lady can trust, so I must trust you too.

249
00:24:43,960 --> 00:24:46,100
Hurry and eat.

250
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:54,780
We bribed the executioner in advance, so he left the tendons intact.

251
00:24:56,610 --> 00:25:02,520
It will take some time for the wound to heal, but he will be able to walk.

252
00:25:04,500 --> 00:25:06,400
Yeok.

253
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:35,280
Today, I saw Yeok in my dream again.

254
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:41,610
Yes, like I always have done, I killed him again.

255
00:25:42,990 --> 00:25:46,260
He's quite vicious.

256
00:25:46,260 --> 00:25:50,270
I kill him again and again but he keeps showing up in my dream.

257
00:25:50,270 --> 00:25:56,400
If you happen to know a way to get rid of him, please tell me.

258
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:59,770
At this rate, I will die.

259
00:26:00,750 --> 00:26:05,250
It's all because of me.

260
00:26:05,990 --> 00:26:09,560
Five years ago, and this time too.

261
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:12,820
I caused Yeok to die.

262
00:26:13,450 --> 00:26:16,870
With words, I said let's cut the mother-son ties.

263
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:21,790
Still, I believed your words that you would keep Yeok alive.

264
00:26:21,790 --> 00:26:25,730
At least till then, I

265
00:26:25,730 --> 00:26:30,990
wasn't only Yeok's mother, I was also your mother.

266
00:26:30,990 --> 00:26:39,020
However, you broke my trust and drove Yeok to the point of death, yet again!

267
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:44,270
Like you've always been, with your suspicion and tyranny,

268
00:26:44,270 --> 00:26:48,950
you will lose your loved ones!

269
00:26:49,740 --> 00:26:55,700
You will live your whole life in loneliness and sickness!

270
00:27:13,590 --> 00:27:16,820
If you want to stay alive,

271
00:27:20,210 --> 00:27:22,480
shut that mouth.

272
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:52,560
I believed your words that you would keep Yeok alive. At least till then, I

273
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:58,280
wasn't only Yeok's mother, I was also your mother.

274
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:02,490
You were my mother? No.

275
00:28:02,490 --> 00:28:05,520
You never were my mother.

276
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,610
Yeok always came first.

277
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:15,070
I must save my mother too.

278
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:21,730
Your Majesty. You looked for me?

279
00:28:21,730 --> 00:28:28,520
Right this instant! Bring those wenches who drove my mother to death!

280
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:32,970
Yes.

281
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:42,160
After that day, the king became a monster.

282
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:49,350
What are you doing?

283
00:28:51,470 --> 00:28:53,080
Hit them.

284
00:28:53,970 --> 00:28:56,230
Your Majesty!

285
00:28:58,390 --> 00:29:00,580
What are you doing?

286
00:29:00,580 --> 00:29:02,690
I said to hit them!

287
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:05,390
Y-your Majesty!

288
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:11,410
The tyranny no one can stop nor predict began and

289
00:29:14,670 --> 00:29:18,990
there was a bloodbath in and out of the palace.

290
00:29:21,050 --> 00:29:25,930
After receiving a death sentence by poison, my mother died with her insides turned out.

291
00:29:25,930 --> 00:29:31,270
Court officials trembled with anxiety that Joseon might come to an end.

292
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:41,000
The people lost the king

293
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:44,550
and the nation that could protect them.

294
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:57,000
You must be afraid.

295
00:29:57,990 --> 00:30:02,010
He killed Concubine Jung and Concubine Uhm who participated in the discussion to depose the queen.

296
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:06,950
Now even the safety of the Queen Dowager is uncertain.

297
00:30:06,950 --> 00:30:12,470
Watch your words. What is your motive in telling me these things?

298
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:18,390
What do you mean motive? I just thought you might be bored being imprisoned here.

299
00:30:18,390 --> 00:30:22,770
I came here to chat and give you news from outside.

300
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:26,870
I don't need such things, so don't ever come again.

301
00:30:28,630 --> 00:30:31,570
Still, she's the Grand Prince Jin Seong's mother.

302
00:30:31,570 --> 00:30:35,240
Shouldn't I at least give you the news concerning the Queen Dowager?

303
00:30:35,240 --> 00:30:38,320
The Queen Dowager is also mother to the king. How—

304
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:43,460
Do you still not know His Majesty?

305
00:30:44,590 --> 00:30:50,970
Don't try to urge the king to spare the Queen Dowager.

306
00:30:51,730 --> 00:30:54,460
He's not the same king as before.

307
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:11,300
Don't be like this. Take a bite.

308
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:20,560
My father told me that the reason why home cooking tastes good is because of my mother.

309
00:31:20,560 --> 00:31:25,500
He said that it tastes good regardless of skill because of the deep consideration for family that goes into it.

310
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:29,960
I hope you would be like that too, Your Highness.

311
00:31:29,960 --> 00:31:35,590
The meal shouldn't be tasty because of the side dishes but I would like it to be delicious because I made the side dishes.

312
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:45,440
I miss my lady a lot too.

313
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:48,330
Your Highness the Grand Prince!

314
00:31:52,290 --> 00:31:57,470
Gosh, they can come in. Why do you need to go out?

315
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:13,130
So, how is the situation?

316
00:32:13,130 --> 00:32:15,170
Gosh. Don't even mention it.

317
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,730
People died in droves because of the deposed queen, now carts carrying bribes are in droves—

318
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:23,050
Is Yeok asking about such things that everyone knows about?

319
00:32:23,050 --> 00:32:24,560
Then what?

320
00:32:25,270 --> 00:32:27,540
It hasn't gotten any better.

321
00:32:27,540 --> 00:32:31,200
Your wife continues to be confined to the detached palace.

322
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:33,770
She can't go anywhere without the king's permission.

323
00:32:33,770 --> 00:32:36,600
The Queen Dowager is under heavy surveillance too.

324
00:32:37,990 --> 00:32:42,390
Oh, there is news of the Queen Dowager being sick—

325
00:32:44,500 --> 00:32:48,100
Given the circumstances, she's become more frail.

326
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:50,150
It's nothing serious.

327
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:06,120
Lee Ki Hong, who recently became the governor of Jeolla Province, had this precious deer tailbone sent over to thank you for your royal favor.

328
00:33:10,370 --> 00:33:15,570
This is the silky fowl presented by Choi Chan, who was recently promoted to be the Captain.

329
00:33:15,570 --> 00:33:19,770
Head Eunuch, how is Yeok doing?

330
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:25,660
Yes. I have heard that he is trying to adjust to the discomfort of his body.

331
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:28,730
I should've checked in on him once in a while.

332
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:31,410
I was too inattentive.

333
00:33:31,410 --> 00:33:33,590
Go to Yeok.

334
00:33:33,590 --> 00:33:40,150
I'm curious about how his legs are and how he's walking.

335
00:34:11,270 --> 00:34:12,980
Grand Prince.

336
00:34:14,570 --> 00:34:16,470
Are you alright?

337
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:15,990
Your Majesty, you seem to have gotten bored again.

338
00:35:15,990 --> 00:35:18,750
Seeing that you've sent someone from the palace again.

339
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:22,780
Goodness, it's hot. It's so hot.
(Gyeongsangdo dialect meaning "Leave, go away.")

340
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,800
It's so hot. Why are you hanging around here?

341
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:26,420
Are you a rat?

342
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,540
Goodness, you're small in size.

343
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:29,680
Enough!

344
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,070
Goodness, you even talk!

345
00:35:32,070 --> 00:35:33,640
Stop it!

346
00:36:17,100 --> 00:36:20,110
Become King as soon as possible.

347
00:36:20,110 --> 00:36:25,920
If you become King, you can protect the remaining people.

348
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:32,360
To me, to us, the King is nothing but a murderer who killed families

349
00:36:32,360 --> 00:36:36,550
and an incompetent ruler who torments the people.

350
00:36:38,650 --> 00:36:41,400
You're right.

351
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:45,850
There is no longer any hope for the King.

352
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:51,310
I will most certainly get rid of the King and resolve your pent-up grudge.

353
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:10,560
His Majesty is here.

354
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,890
I greet Your Majesty.

355
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,090
How is it?

356
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,480
Is this place to your liking?

357
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:35,430
Instead of unfamiliar palace servants, I thought they would be better.

358
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:37,380
I told them to stay here.

359
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:41,690
Now I can no longer see you with the same heart I used to have, Your Majesty.

360
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:44,550
I am receiving a lot of help.

361
00:37:56,790 --> 00:37:58,920
I will come again tomorrow.

362
00:38:05,390 --> 00:38:08,360
His Majesty is here.

363
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:12,890
I greet Your Majesty.

364
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:21,270
Sit down.

365
00:38:38,860 --> 00:38:40,740
I will come again.

366
00:38:51,660 --> 00:38:53,110
Palace Guard Command Map

367
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:57,060
The king's guard, including the King's Seonjeonkwan (Herald), the Royal Guards,

368
00:38:57,060 --> 00:39:00,020
and Convoy (Howee-cheong) add up to about 2,000 men.

369
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,610
Out of them, about 400-500 will be on night duty.

370
00:39:02,610 --> 00:39:05,810
About 100 warriors will be guarding the king from nearby.

371
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,860
They are each capable of fighting 100 people.

372
00:39:07,860 --> 00:39:09,760
They will be the ones to fight the final battle.

373
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:13,580
The Capital Defense is pretty much on your side.

374
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:18,780
Out of the 12 captains and 20 assistant captains of the Capital Defense guarding the palace, more than half of them

375
00:39:18,780 --> 00:39:21,900
are my uncle and Lord Seong's people.

376
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:24,130
Troops from the Minister of Defense will be the biggest problem for us.

377
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:26,410
If these forces come into the palace,

378
00:39:26,410 --> 00:39:31,430
it will be difficult to fight them with the Snail Brides and Capital Defense troops alone.

379
00:39:31,430 --> 00:39:33,800
Then we have to drag them out.

380
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:37,750
Outside the palace.

381
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:40,120
Outside the capital if possible.

382
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:51,400
I'll come again tomorrow.

383
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:56,400
Do you have something to tell me?

384
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:59,320
No.

385
00:39:59,320 --> 00:40:03,830
Then, why do you come here every day?

386
00:40:05,130 --> 00:40:08,800
By chance, is it because you are anxious?

387
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:12,620
Because the Grand Prince might have come here?

388
00:40:12,620 --> 00:40:15,100
How can he come here?

389
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:17,410
He can't even walk.

390
00:40:21,990 --> 00:40:30,500
I'm just coming because it's amazing that you're here by my side.

391
00:40:32,100 --> 00:40:37,150
I can't stand it without confirming every day.

392
00:40:47,060 --> 00:40:52,610
During this time, I've been ignoring you because I didn't know how to act around you.

393
00:40:53,820 --> 00:40:58,900
I couldn't look into your eyes.

394
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:04,770
But Your Majesty, if you truly saw me as a woman,

395
00:41:04,770 --> 00:41:08,770
you shouldn't have made the Grand Prince and me get married.

396
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:18,620
Then at the very least, we could've remained as friends and family.

397
00:41:18,620 --> 00:41:22,210
If so, would you not have married Yeok?

398
00:41:22,210 --> 00:41:27,550
Instead of not being able to marry and living while longing for each other,

399
00:41:27,550 --> 00:41:33,650
being married while making each other hate and resent each other is more preferable.

400
00:41:33,650 --> 00:41:35,580
But Your Majesty—

401
00:41:43,530 --> 00:41:48,900
If you don't have a reason, please don't come see me so frequently.

402
00:41:48,900 --> 00:41:50,970
It puts me in a difficult position.

403
00:41:50,970 --> 00:41:53,070
It makes me uncomfortable.

404
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:58,920
I make you uncomfortable?

405
00:41:59,530 --> 00:42:01,760
Yes.

406
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:03,440
How so?

407
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:07,180
Because some day you will kill me.

408
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,670
Why would I kill you?

409
00:42:09,670 --> 00:42:12,780
I will die if something bad happens to you

410
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:15,580
since I'm part of your family.

411
00:42:15,580 --> 00:42:18,210
I will also die if something bad happens to the Grand Prince

412
00:42:18,210 --> 00:42:20,580
because I'm his wife.

413
00:42:22,050 --> 00:42:27,930
Probably, even if I die or live, I won't be able to do so entirely

414
00:42:27,930 --> 00:42:30,550
and will continue to live this life.

415
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:37,150
So, please don't expect anything from me.

416
00:42:38,270 --> 00:42:45,420
Besides a dead heart, I have nothing to give you.

417
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:03,950
All you have to give me is nothing but a dead heart?

418
00:43:04,800 --> 00:43:10,160
Like that, in a half-dead state, I wait for His Highness the Grand Prince.

419
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:15,680
When the Grand Prince returns, then I will also have to choose.

420
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:20,690
Whose woman will I live and die as?

421
00:43:32,810 --> 00:43:36,420
These are news sent by the Snail Brides from different regions.

422
00:43:40,160 --> 00:43:45,710
Yoo Bin, Lee Gwa, Kim Joon Seon who are in exile in the Jeolla Province

423
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:48,870
have raised troops and are planning to revolt.

424
00:43:48,870 --> 00:43:50,780
What's the matter?

425
00:43:50,780 --> 00:43:54,810
There are rebel forces attacking from the countryside.

426
00:43:56,940 --> 00:44:01,000
Are they planning to attack the King?

427
00:44:02,050 --> 00:44:04,460
Assassins!

428
00:44:04,460 --> 00:44:06,220
Hurry.

429
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,340
- Release them!
- Yes, sir!

430
00:44:14,340 --> 00:44:15,920
Save us!

431
00:44:17,110 --> 00:44:18,720
Save us!

432
00:44:22,750 --> 00:44:28,000
Those who were demoted or exiled to the countryside after falling out of the king's favor

433
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,710
joined forces with the heads of each region and gathered troops.

434
00:44:31,710 --> 00:44:34,290
They have begun to march towards the capital.

435
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:38,550
They must be planning to attack the king and gain control of the court.

436
00:44:38,550 --> 00:44:42,300
How much time do we have until the rebel forces enter the capital?

437
00:44:42,300 --> 00:44:46,820
A few days. Two days, or three to four days at the longest.

438
00:44:47,530 --> 00:44:51,820
That's not enough time to gather the forces right away and to defend them.

439
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:56,030
At this rate, there will be a civil war.

440
00:44:56,030 --> 00:44:59,420
Not only the capital but the palace will also see a bloodbath.

441
00:44:59,420 --> 00:45:04,760
Before then, don't you think we should also make up our minds?

442
00:45:04,760 --> 00:45:07,940
If we just sit idly like this and the rebel forces take control,

443
00:45:07,940 --> 00:45:14,160
all of us who have held important positions in central government will be purged.

444
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:37,350
His Majesty is not feeling well, so there will be no court session today.

445
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:43,100
If you have urgent reports, please report to me.

446
00:45:43,980 --> 00:45:49,730
Still, we can't report state affairs to the Chief Royal Secretary.

447
00:45:50,570 --> 00:45:56,800
Well... Without going through me, how will you be able to discuss state affairs?

448
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:59,570
Let's wait and see.

449
00:45:59,570 --> 00:46:03,600
This is why a revolt is happening in the countryside!

450
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:06,060
Did you say a revolt?

451
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:11,090
Yes. All around the countryside, signs of revolt are appearing.

452
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:14,410
There are not many days left until it occurs in the capital as well!

453
00:46:16,250 --> 00:46:18,120
My L-lord!

454
00:46:18,120 --> 00:46:20,120
Excuse me—

455
00:46:21,460 --> 00:46:25,410
Lord, this needs to be resolved quickly.

456
00:46:25,410 --> 00:46:27,350
Give it to me.

457
00:46:31,010 --> 00:46:33,720
Revolt?

458
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:39,140
Due to severe exploitation by the regional government heads,

459
00:46:39,140 --> 00:46:45,110
due to the collusion between the regional government officials and Mr. Im

460
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,510
from the central government.

461
00:46:48,550 --> 00:46:51,300
May an austere punishment be accorded.

462
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:55,420
I will tell His Majesty.

463
00:46:58,530 --> 00:47:04,720
His Majesty doesn't need to know about such trivial matters.

464
00:47:07,740 --> 00:47:09,980
Uncle.

465
00:47:18,710 --> 00:47:23,820
It's Myung Hye. So how was your trip? Did it go well?

466
00:47:23,820 --> 00:47:25,500
Yes.

467
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:30,060
But, what are you so worried about?

468
00:47:30,060 --> 00:47:34,550
I am sure you've heard of it. About the rebels.

469
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,600
They are greater in force than I expected.

470
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:39,650
If something goes wrong, we might be in danger too.

471
00:47:39,650 --> 00:47:42,450
Are the starving people able to distinguish between an evil influential family

472
00:47:42,450 --> 00:47:45,380
and a good influential family?

473
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:49,280
If it's about that matter, you don't have to worry.

474
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:53,050
It seems that the Grand Prince's strategy has succeeded.

475
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:58,460
Remember when you said that to fool your enemy, you should start by fooling your own side?

476
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:05,750
Your Highness the Grand Prince, why did you hide this plan even from me?

477
00:48:05,750 --> 00:48:08,820
Deputy Commander, please continue to act as if you are fooled.

478
00:48:08,820 --> 00:48:10,160
Your Highness the Grand Prince.

479
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:15,760
Rebel forces gathered in countryside are rumored to be 1,000 already.

480
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:20,850
If they enter the capital, they could join forces with the Capital Defense troops

481
00:48:20,850 --> 00:48:24,390
and will form a grand troop that will greatly outnumber the Royal Forces.

482
00:48:24,390 --> 00:48:28,360
Those who are shocked by the great number of troops will flee fearing for their lives.

483
00:48:28,360 --> 00:48:30,390
Then the palace will be empty.

484
00:48:30,390 --> 00:48:38,330
Yes. I intend to infiltrate the palace during this chaos and have a talk with the king.

485
00:48:38,330 --> 00:48:43,400
If you and Lord Seong can hold out the Royal Guards with the Capital Defense forces,

486
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,490
you will be able to stall so I have a chance to subdue the king.

487
00:48:46,490 --> 00:48:51,320
But what is your reason for hiding this from the ministers of our anti-Royalist factions?

488
00:48:55,760 --> 00:49:00,630
That is, to prevent betrayals.

489
00:49:01,580 --> 00:49:07,860
Not every single person who participates in the revolt will have a firm resolve.

490
00:49:07,860 --> 00:49:14,160
We're trying to do something that hasn't been done before. Being afraid is human nature.

491
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:19,340
In the case that someone betrays us, all of us will die.

492
00:49:19,340 --> 00:49:24,790
Thus, if they don't actively participate in the revolt,

493
00:49:24,790 --> 00:49:31,350
I want them to feel threatened that they might die in the hands of the rebel forces.

494
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,660
Then they won't be able to have needless thoughts.

495
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:41,890
Since a person considers his life as the most important.

496
00:49:41,890 --> 00:49:46,870
Then, are you planning to hide it till the end?

497
00:49:48,170 --> 00:49:53,890
Yes. This time, we cannot afford to fail.

498
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:58,610
Countless lives and the fate of the nation depend on it.

499
00:49:58,610 --> 00:50:06,920
Especially for me. My family... is in the palace. Do you understand?

500
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:09,420
I will keep it in mind.

501
00:50:21,230 --> 00:50:24,970
Your Majesty. First Vice Premier Sin Soo Geun who is under house arrest,

502
00:50:24,970 --> 00:50:28,250
sent tidings through letter again today.

503
00:50:38,740 --> 00:50:43,120
No. Take it out and give it to me.

504
00:50:44,670 --> 00:50:50,960
Grand Prince. Have your legs healed?

505
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:54,310
Do you eat meals on time?

506
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:57,840
His Majesty is here.

507
00:51:08,130 --> 00:51:12,100
I am here today for a reason.

508
00:51:21,190 --> 00:51:25,390
The First Vice Premier sends a letter to me every day.

509
00:51:25,390 --> 00:51:32,350
He must be asking about my welfare and giving me advice as the minister of a nation.

510
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:36,870
But I am sure he's trying this hard to relieve my anger

511
00:51:36,870 --> 00:51:41,260
since he's worried about your being confined in a palace.

512
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:45,850
Thus, if you don't want his effort to be futile,

513
00:51:45,850 --> 00:51:53,690
I want you to read these letters to me every day.

514
00:51:53,690 --> 00:51:56,880
I will follow your order.

515
00:52:00,990 --> 00:52:03,490
Do you remember this note?

516
00:52:03,490 --> 00:52:06,460
This is your birthday invitation, the one you gave me

517
00:52:06,460 --> 00:52:09,780
when you were the eldest prince.

518
00:52:16,200 --> 00:52:20,000
I especially invite you to my birthday party. So please come to Chiro-jung in two days at the hour of the sheep (1-3pm).

519
00:52:20,000 --> 00:52:23,600
You don't need to bring a present but if you bring one, I won't refuse. You must come. I will be waiting.

520
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:27,300
Read this.

521
00:52:31,050 --> 00:52:34,030
Your Majesty. I've watched the moon many times

522
00:52:34,030 --> 00:52:38,200
but the best one was the moon I watched looking up from the Gyeonghoeru.

523
00:52:38,200 --> 00:52:43,960
I really miss the liquor we drank together under the moonlight.

524
00:52:43,960 --> 00:52:46,350
Read this.

525
00:52:46,350 --> 00:52:50,160
Your Majesty. When citizens have nightmares, they use the evening primrose—

526
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:52,940
I can't listen any longer.

527
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:56,510
The First Vice Premier's letter writing skills are really horrible.

528
00:52:56,510 --> 00:52:58,980
I can't stand to listen to this anymore.

529
00:53:01,500 --> 00:53:04,720
What's with that expression?

530
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:07,630
Are you not happy to see me?

531
00:53:12,940 --> 00:53:15,670
Are you looking down on me?

532
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:23,510
I am the wife of a criminal.

533
00:53:23,510 --> 00:53:29,270
How can I wear extravagant clothing and put on expensive accessories?

534
00:53:30,060 --> 00:53:34,590
I will personally bring them from now on.

535
00:53:56,740 --> 00:53:58,740
Father,

536
00:54:00,360 --> 00:54:04,140
what should I do now?

537
00:54:16,670 --> 00:54:21,540
I am in awe of your loyalty, First Vice Premier.

538
00:54:21,540 --> 00:54:25,840
How can the king discard such a loyal subject as you?

539
00:54:25,840 --> 00:54:30,250
I am a sinner who deceived my lord. How can you call me a loyal subject?

540
00:54:30,250 --> 00:54:36,010
No, that's not true. It was the king who lied first.

541
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:39,850
With your own eyes, you saw the will of the late king.

542
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:41,930
Deputy Commander!

543
00:54:42,670 --> 00:54:46,550
If you want to say such things, please leave.

544
00:54:46,550 --> 00:54:51,570
Due to the king's greed, officials and the people die every day.

545
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:56,420
For the royal family and the nation, you must decide.

546
00:54:58,780 --> 00:55:01,190
I made my decision.

547
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:06,110
I will drive out the tyrant Lee Yoong and enthrone the Grand Prince Jin Seong to be king.

548
00:55:06,110 --> 00:55:11,290
What are you ... Must you do this?

549
00:55:11,290 --> 00:55:13,870
You will have to make a decision too.

550
00:55:13,870 --> 00:55:17,910
However, it will be a more difficult decision for you.

551
00:55:17,910 --> 00:55:23,410
Choosing between your sister or your daughter.

552
00:55:23,410 --> 00:55:27,600
If it's hard to answer this question, should I change the question?

553
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:35,380
Will you die as the king's subject or will you live as the father of a daughter?

554
00:55:36,550 --> 00:55:41,530
If you choose your daughter, could you please not do anything today?

555
00:55:41,530 --> 00:55:46,760
If you make a move, that must mean you're going to the king to tell him of our plans,

556
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,110
I will take it that you'll be going against us.

557
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:16,170
Your only daughter should stay alive, shouldn't she?

558
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:48,990
What happened?

559
00:56:48,990 --> 00:56:50,660
Everything is ready.

560
00:56:50,660 --> 00:56:52,950
The rebel forces are at the Gwacheon relay station.

561
00:56:52,950 --> 00:56:56,910
It will take a day to arrive. Myung Hye will join them tonight and lead the forces.

562
00:56:56,910 --> 00:57:00,110
Perfect. Let's get going.

563
00:57:09,110 --> 00:57:13,260
Are you sure those are the royal offerings headed to the palace?

564
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:14,470
Security is too lax.

565
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:17,720
Who would dare to steal things belonging to Im Sa Hong and the king?

566
00:57:17,720 --> 00:57:22,060
They are full of themselves. Well, we're not complaining.

567
00:57:56,460 --> 00:57:58,400
Gwanghwa Gate ( the main gate of the palace)

568
00:58:09,720 --> 00:58:11,710
Halt.

569
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:17,760
Show me the pass and list of the items.

570
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:25,160
Let us pass right away. The Chief Royal Secretary is waiting.

571
00:58:25,160 --> 00:58:27,800
We still need to do what needs to be done.

572
00:58:30,450 --> 00:58:32,710
You're right. You do what needs to be done

573
00:58:32,710 --> 00:58:35,260
and we will give what needs to be given.

574
00:58:37,650 --> 00:58:40,110
You're working hard.

575
00:58:40,960 --> 00:58:44,340
- Pass!
- Wait!

576
00:58:48,820 --> 00:58:52,970
Look here. Are you—

577
00:58:54,870 --> 00:58:57,450
What's with the delay?

578
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:02,020
Why are you dallying over at the gate?

579
00:59:06,770 --> 00:59:09,120
Hurry and let them pass.

580
00:59:09,120 --> 00:59:11,290
I understand.

581
00:59:11,290 --> 00:59:13,060
Pass!

582
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:48,410
What's going on?

583
01:00:17,500 --> 01:00:19,440
Royal Mother.

584
01:00:21,060 --> 01:00:22,990
Yeok.

585
01:00:22,990 --> 01:00:27,790
You've waited for a long time. Your son is here.

586
01:00:45,330 --> 01:00:46,890
How did you find—?

587
01:00:46,890 --> 01:00:50,520
Yes, I found this on my own, so hurry up and put it on my finger.

588
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,380
It fits perfectly.

589
01:01:14,230 --> 01:01:16,910
Is-is anyone there?

590
01:01:24,060 --> 01:01:28,360
Chae Gyeong, I am here.

591
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:34,340
You have waited for a long time, haven't you?

592
01:01:34,340 --> 01:01:40,870
♫  Suddenly the whole world is filled by you ♫

593
01:01:42,060 --> 01:01:48,730
♫  Suddenly you were there without a sound ♫

594
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:56,640
♫  The first moment I saw you, I was so nervous ♫

595
01:01:57,540 --> 01:02:04,120
♫ What do I do now when my breath is about to stop?  ♫

596
01:02:05,290 --> 01:02:08,060
Have you already forgotten how it feels to be touched by me?

597
01:02:08,060 --> 01:02:15,720
♫  I want to hold you, the one whose brilliance chills my heart  ♫

598
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:23,480
♫  I'm afraid you might fly away when the wind blows  ♫

599
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:31,320
♫  Because your smile and tears fill my heart,  ♫

600
01:02:33,700 --> 01:02:37,670
♫  I will always love only you  ♫

601
01:02:37,670 --> 01:02:40,790
Queen for Seven Days

602
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,980
Follow me to the royal palace.

603
01:02:42,980 --> 01:02:45,270
Now, let's move!

604
01:02:45,270 --> 01:02:50,790
You can't even control your own heart, how can you try to control somebody else's life?

605
01:02:50,790 --> 01:02:52,550
I have already warned you.

606
01:02:52,550 --> 01:02:56,180
I could kill you anytime. I will have you, even if it means that I have to kill you.

607
01:02:56,180 --> 01:02:59,760
I must put everything back to its rightful place.

608
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:04,560
Did you come all the way here when you don't even have the guts to kill me?

609
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,850
Can we be happy?

610
01:03:06,850 --> 01:03:10,990
We can be happy from now.

611
01:03:10,990 --> 01:03:13,230
I should have killed you.

612
01:03:13,230 --> 01:03:15,830
Let's die together instead.

613
01:03:15,830 --> 01:03:17,900
♫ the one whose brilliance chills my heart  ♫
