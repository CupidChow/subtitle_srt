Yeah, right.

No, he's still out.

I'm really sorry, Devon.

It's fine. I was fucking with you.

24
00:01:26,252 --> 00:01:27,420
No, it's not fine.

25
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:30,215
I know what "sirens" means.
I should have answered you.

26
00:01:30,298 --> 00:01:31,382
You were busy.

27
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:34,260
And all that stuff
I said to you last night too.

What was wrong…

38
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,132

39

40

[inhales deeply]

46
00:02:33,278 --> 00:02:38,491
…why he couldn't sleep,
so he kept waking me up all night

47
00:02:38,575 --> 00:02:43,580
asking me, um, "What did the doctor say?
Where are my medications?"

48

Like…

50
00:02:48,376 --> 00:02:51,629
It's, like, every half-hour,

51
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,506
"What did the doctor say, Devon?"

52
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:55,884
"Where are my medications?
What's gonna happen to me now?"

53
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,137
And his face was so, like, dumb and…

54
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:03,725
lost and scared,
and I just lost my fucking shit

55
00:03:03,808 --> 00:03:06,394
and I just screamed
at the top of my lungs,

56
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,104
"Fuck you. Go back to fucking bed."

57
00:03:08,188 --> 00:03:09,189
[inhales deeply]

58
00:03:10,899 --> 00:03:13,484

I was gonna hurt him. [sobs]

[sighs]

60
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:25,205
But he woke me up a half-hour later
and asked me the same questions.

61
00:03:25,288 --> 00:03:26,456
[inhales deeply]

62
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,375
-You have to get out of that house, Devon.
-I know.

63
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:31,836
No, but you really do. You've gotta go.

64
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,421
What's he gonna do without me?

65
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:35,048
He's a vet. He has benefits.

66
00:03:35,131 --> 00:03:38,218
I have a new job. I'll kick in
if it helps you get out of there.

67
00:03:39,928 --> 00:03:41,095
What's the new job?

68
00:03:41,596 --> 00:03:44,432
Um, well, Kiki promoted me.

69
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:49,187
I'm gonna run the foundation in New York.
It's a huge pay bump, free apartment.

70
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,564
Oh, look at you.

71
00:03:53,691 --> 00:03:55,818
Sorry, that sounded mean. I… I…

72
00:03:57,445 --> 00:03:59,030
Hey, I meant it.

73
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:01,282
Look at you.

74
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,078
I'm proud of you, Simone.

75
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:11,000
Why don't you come stay with me
in the city for a while?

76
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:12,752
-[laughs]
-Yeah.

77
00:04:12,835 --> 00:04:13,878
And do what?

78
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:15,463
Okay, what about Palm Beach then?

79
00:04:15,546 --> 00:04:18,508
Morgan told me he invited you.
I think it's a fabulous idea.

80
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:20,551
Yeah, well, he's a pretty sailor, but no.

I don't even have health insurance.

Well, what do you wanna do?

85
00:04:34,524 --> 00:04:36,192
What do you want?

Don't ask me shit like that.
You sound like Ryan Gosling.

I think you wanna say, "Yes, Morgan."

You talk to her? Do you know what's up?

to… to box the stuff up. No further deets.

00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,216
The history there, the foster care.

177
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,051
Morgan told me, and had I known,

178
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:34,472
I never would have welcomed him
into our home, into your home. I'm sorry.

179
00:08:34,555 --> 00:08:36,349
Please, no more apologies.

180
00:08:36,432 --> 00:08:41,687
From what I gather,
his neglect of you was… unspeakable.

181
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:44,565
Yet everyone is talking about it.

182
00:08:45,233 --> 00:08:47,193
-Oh, I'm sorry.
-There you go again.

183
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:49,946
-Yeah, I'm-- Damn.
-No more.

184
00:08:50,029 --> 00:08:51,572
-[Peter mumbles]
-[both chuckle]

185
00:08:51,656 --> 00:08:52,490
[Peter] Hmm.

186
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:53,866
[vehicle approaching]

187
00:08:58,704 --> 00:09:01,123
-[vehicle shifts into park]
-[engine shuts off]

188
00:09:01,207 --> 00:09:03,501
Let me know
if you need anything today, okay?

189
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:04,502
I'm around.

190
00:09:04,585 --> 00:09:05,545
[inhales sharply]

191
00:09:05,628 --> 00:09:07,004
-Question.
-Yes.

192
00:09:10,258 --> 00:09:11,551
Do you know you said "question"?

193
00:09:11,634 --> 00:09:12,843
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

194
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,555
Hold, please. [inhales deeply]

195
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:18,933
[exhales deeply]

196
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,851
[breathes deeply]

197
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,855
Morgan, what time are you leaving
for Palm Beach tomorrow?

198
00:09:25,523 --> 00:09:26,440
Daybreak.

199
00:09:27,441 --> 00:09:28,734
-Dramatic.
-[chuckles softly]

200
00:09:28,818 --> 00:09:30,570
And I'm, uh…

201
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:33,072
still invited?

202
00:09:33,155 --> 00:09:34,198
Yes.

203
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,325
Why? Do you want to come?

204
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:39,036
Yeah, I do.

205
00:09:40,371 --> 00:09:42,498
-I mean, unless there's--
-No, no, no, please. I…

206
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,292
-Unless--
-I'd love your company.

207
00:09:44,375 --> 00:09:45,585
-Yeah. [chuckles]
-Okay.

208
00:09:46,919 --> 00:09:49,297
-Um… Cool.
-[chuckles]

209
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,092
So, daybreak, is that--
Is there a specific time?

210
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:55,595
Or should I just, like, sense it
like a rooster?

211
00:09:55,678 --> 00:09:59,015
Why don't you just come over after
the gala and spend the night with me?

212
00:09:59,098 --> 00:10:00,808
[joyful music playing]

213
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:02,685
-Sounds good.
-Okay.

214
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,020
Okay.

215
00:10:05,313 --> 00:10:06,314
See you later.

216
00:10:06,397 --> 00:10:07,398
Okay, bye.

217
00:10:07,481 --> 00:10:08,733
[chuckles]

218
00:10:09,775 --> 00:10:10,735
[car door closes]

219
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:15,906
[music ends]

220
00:10:15,990 --> 00:10:16,824
Hey, Dad.

221
00:10:17,658 --> 00:10:19,285
I'm home from the hospital.

222
00:10:20,077 --> 00:10:20,911
Dad?

223
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:23,539
Dad?

224
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:27,209
Ray?

225
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:35,176
[suspenseful music playing]

226
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:05,706
[music ends]

227
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:06,624
Dad!

228
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,251
What are you doing?

229
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,045
[tense music playing]

230
00:11:11,128 --> 00:11:11,962
Dad!

231
00:11:14,090 --> 00:11:14,924
Dad!

232
00:11:17,385 --> 00:11:18,344
Dad. Hey.

233
00:11:18,427 --> 00:11:20,388
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dad.

234
00:11:20,888 --> 00:11:21,764
Hey.

235
00:11:22,723 --> 00:11:24,308
What are you doing out here all alone?

236
00:11:24,809 --> 00:11:25,893
I wasn't alone.

237
00:11:27,645 --> 00:11:28,729
Your mom was here.

238
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,189
[waves crashing]

239
00:11:30,731 --> 00:11:32,566
[birds squawking]

240
00:11:35,486 --> 00:11:36,320
Okay.

241
00:11:37,488 --> 00:11:39,156
[exhales] Let's get back from the edge.

242
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,033
Come on. It's okay.

243
00:11:42,284 --> 00:11:43,369
-It's okay.
-[exhales]

244
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:47,915
[monitor beeping]

245
00:11:51,335 --> 00:11:52,336
[Peter] Hey, buddy.

246
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:54,547
Can you hear me?

247
00:11:55,047 --> 00:11:57,466
[groaning]

248
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,676
[Peter] Okay.

249
00:11:58,759 --> 00:12:00,344
Okay, take it… take it easy.

250
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:03,514
You're in the hospital.
You've had quite a fall.

251
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:04,890
[Ethan exhales]

252
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:08,018
Are those… my legs?

253
00:12:09,103 --> 00:12:10,771
Yeah, they're broken,

254
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,066
and your arm too and a couple of ribs.

255
00:12:14,150 --> 00:12:18,487
But the doctor says
you're expected to make a full recovery.

256
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,406
You are a very lucky guy.

257
00:12:20,489 --> 00:12:21,615
[laughs sarcastically]

258
00:12:22,992 --> 00:12:24,034
Nice.

259
00:12:24,118 --> 00:12:25,453
Here, have some water.

260
00:12:26,454 --> 00:12:27,288
[groans softly]

261
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:29,415
[slurping] Mmm! Mmm!

262
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,167
[smacks lips] Ah!

263
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,919
Sippy good. [laughs]

264
00:12:34,962 --> 00:12:37,047
Oh… [inhales sharply]

265
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,549
Hey, I really…

266
00:12:40,092 --> 00:12:42,511
[softly] I really appreciate
you guys being here.

267
00:12:46,307 --> 00:12:47,391
Oh, not you.

268
00:12:48,976 --> 00:12:51,061
No, no, not you. I don't want you here.

269
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:54,190
-Guards! Guards!
-Hey, hey, hey.

270
00:12:54,273 --> 00:12:56,525
-I've been worried about you.
-No, no, no. You pushed me.

271
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:57,985
-What?
-You pushed me.

272
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,031
There was a big push, and it was from you.

273
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:03,824
-No, you're confused.
-[spluttering]

274
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:05,326
I was falling… [inhales deeply]

275
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:09,205
and then… and then you were above me,
and you had wings.

276
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,623
[Simone] You were drunk.

277
00:13:10,706 --> 00:13:13,000
You pushed me, and you watched me fall,
and you laughed.

278
00:13:13,083 --> 00:13:15,211
I was screaming for help,
if that's what you mean.

279
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,421
-You're a witch!
-Okay, let's just slow down.

280
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:21,133
You've had a concussion,
and you're on a lot of pain medication.

281
00:13:21,217 --> 00:13:22,843
-Show him your wings.
-Okay.

282
00:13:22,927 --> 00:13:25,262
-Show him who you really are!
-Whoa, whoa. Okay. Oh…

283
00:13:25,346 --> 00:13:28,682
Okay, that's… that's quite enough of that,
all right?

284
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:32,394
Look, she doesn't want to marry you, okay?

285
00:13:32,478 --> 00:13:33,687
That is her right.

286
00:13:33,771 --> 00:13:36,315
I don't understand. She did this.

287
00:13:36,398 --> 00:13:38,818
No, you did this.

288
00:13:40,277 --> 00:13:42,112
Now, you need to find some manners,

289
00:13:42,905 --> 00:13:44,865
or me and you are gonna have an issue.

290
00:13:44,949 --> 00:13:46,450
[Ethan] I'm sorry, Peter.

291
00:13:48,244 --> 00:13:49,453
My body hurts.

292
00:13:49,537 --> 00:13:50,913
[Peter clicks tongue] You're okay.

293
00:13:51,872 --> 00:13:52,873
Have your sippy.

294
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:53,958
[pensive music playing]

295
00:13:54,041 --> 00:13:56,502
[Ethan slurping] Mmm. Mmm.

296
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:58,504
Mmm.

297
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,258
-[Devon] Hey, Dad, have you seen Ray?
-Who?

298
00:14:02,341 --> 00:14:04,468
Dad, Ray, my friend Raymond.

299
00:14:05,177 --> 00:14:08,013
He's not in the guest house,
and it doesn't look like he slept there.

300
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,307
-You don't know where he is?
-No.

301
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,560
Well, did he not come home last night?

302
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:14,436
How should I know? He's your boyfriend.

303
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:17,189
Hey, he… That's… He's not my boyfriend.

304
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,649
I made that very clear.

305
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:21,277
-Fooled me.
-Last night, on the beach.

306
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,695
Fuck! Come on.

307
00:14:23,195 --> 00:14:26,407
-Now where are we going?
-Come on. We gotta go this way.

308
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:28,325
-Devon.
-I'm sorry.

309
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,578
[suspenseful music playing]

310
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:41,505
Oh no. [sighs]

311
00:14:42,381 --> 00:14:44,383
[tense music playing]

312
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:47,720
[music fades]

313
00:14:48,679 --> 00:14:49,972
Maybe he went swimming?

314
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:54,977
[grunts, blows]

315
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,354
Who's Allie?

316
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,566
Called like 49 times.

317
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,109
Oh God.

318
00:15:03,027 --> 00:15:03,944
His wife.

319
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:07,698
Maybe he went back to Buffalo?

320
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:12,119
Without his phone and his keys
and his wallet and his pants?

321
00:15:12,202 --> 00:15:13,662
-I don't know.
-[exhales deeply]

322
00:15:14,622 --> 00:15:18,083
The last thing I said to him last night
was that I'd be better off if he drowned.

323
00:15:18,876 --> 00:15:19,793
[laughs]

324
00:15:19,877 --> 00:15:22,379
It's not funny. Do you think that he…

325
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:23,756
That kid? No way.

326
00:15:24,256 --> 00:15:25,925
He doesn't have the nuggets.

327
00:15:26,008 --> 00:15:29,094
What if he swam out too far
and he's just treading water somewhere

328
00:15:29,178 --> 00:15:30,471
miles from shore?

329
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:32,890
[phone chiming]

330
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,016
Hey, it's Allie.

331
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,268
[Devon] Dad, no. Dad!

332
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,728
-Hi.
-[Allie] Hello. Who is this?

333
00:15:37,811 --> 00:15:38,687
I'm Bruce.

334
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,773
No, Allie, hey. Hey, girl.

335
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,441
Long time. What's up?

336
00:15:42,524 --> 00:15:44,902
Devon? Why do you have Ray's phone?

337
00:15:44,985 --> 00:15:46,236
Th-- This is Ray's phone?

338
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,529
That's, uh… I…

339
00:15:48,405 --> 00:15:51,659
[laughs] No kidding.
I just, uh, found this on the beach.

340
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:52,993
[Allie] I knew it.

341
00:15:53,077 --> 00:15:54,453
He's with you, isn't he?

342
00:15:54,536 --> 00:15:55,704
I, uh…

343
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:59,625
You're cutting in and out. Is there…
You're not on the Wi-Fi?

344
00:15:59,708 --> 00:16:00,918
Can't hear you.

345
00:16:01,001 --> 00:16:02,211
[Allie] Don't lie to me.

346
00:16:02,294 --> 00:16:03,462
You're together.

347
00:16:06,548 --> 00:16:07,383
I'm…

348
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,844
I'm really sorry, Allie.

349
00:16:13,681 --> 00:16:16,016
But I really don't know where he is.
I can't…

350
00:16:16,558 --> 00:16:18,852
-I can't find him anywhere.
-[Allie] I know where he is.

351
00:16:19,436 --> 00:16:21,730
He's on an island with a fucking whore.

352
00:16:21,814 --> 00:16:22,815

[pensive music playing]

354
00:16:42,042 --> 00:16:44,837
[indistinct conversation]

355
00:16:58,308 --> 00:17:00,310
[wheelbarrow rattling]

356
00:17:05,065 --> 00:17:07,151
[indistinct chatter]

357
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:10,696
[gasps] Simone, hello and good morning.

358
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,698
[Patrice] Hey, look, everyone,
it's Simone.

359
00:17:12,781 --> 00:17:14,324
[all] Hi, Simone.

360
00:17:14,408 --> 00:17:15,242
[Simone] Um…

361
00:17:15,826 --> 00:17:17,244
What's with you guys?

362
00:17:17,327 --> 00:17:18,954
[Missy] It's just such a beautiful day.

363
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:23,542
Yes, the sun is bright, sky majestic.
Who knows what the day will bring?

364
00:17:23,625 --> 00:17:24,543
Maybe glory.

365
00:17:24,626 --> 00:17:25,627
[all laugh]

366
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:26,920
Um…

367
00:17:27,004 --> 00:17:28,881
Okay. Creepy.

368
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,049
Uh, where's Kiki?

369
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:31,133
Rehearsal.

370
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:35,095
Yeah. I am walking in that direction.
Let's go together, yeah?

371
00:17:35,179 --> 00:17:36,305
-Yeah.
-[Jose] Good.

372
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:38,974
[dramatic music playing]

373
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:48,776
[chuckles]

374
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,695
Here's the updated list for you,
Mrs. Kell, for your approval.

375
00:17:51,779 --> 00:17:52,863
Great, thank you.

376
00:17:52,946 --> 00:17:54,073
Both legs?

377
00:17:54,156 --> 00:17:57,367
Uh, the femur in one,
but he's gonna be okay.

378
00:17:57,451 --> 00:17:58,702
God! Poor Ethan.

379
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:01,997
-He really should be dead.
-[gasps] Is he still coming to the gala?

380
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,291
-Oh, hi, Simone.
-Hi, Simone.

381
00:18:04,374 --> 00:18:07,044
Hi, ladies.
I'm… I'm so sorry that I'm late.

382
00:18:07,127 --> 00:18:08,545
Uh, where do you want me, Kiki?

383
00:18:09,088 --> 00:18:11,590
Oh, I don't need you for this.
Could you wait for me in your room?

384
00:18:11,673 --> 00:18:13,425
How will I know my blocking?

385
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:17,304
You want me out front
now that I'm technically cabinet, right?

386
00:18:17,387 --> 00:18:19,640
[inhales deeply]
Did you guys hear the good news?

387
00:18:19,723 --> 00:18:20,682
Um…

388
00:18:21,308 --> 00:18:22,976
-I'm gonna run the foundation.
-[Lisa gasps]

389
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,603
-You are?
-Simone, you get it…

390
00:18:24,686 --> 00:18:25,646
[laughing] Thank you.

391
00:18:25,729 --> 00:18:27,272
Please do as I ask, Simone.

392
00:18:28,732 --> 00:18:30,109
[hesitating] Yeah.

393
00:18:31,276 --> 00:18:32,653
-Yeah, okay.
-[Michaela] Thank you.

394
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,240
[inhales deeply]

395
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:39,243
All right, opening position
same as last year.

396
00:18:39,326 --> 00:18:41,620
Peter, um, stop looking so miserable.

397
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,621
I am miserable.

398
00:18:42,704 --> 00:18:44,706
Can you move six inches to the left?

399
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:49,378
I know where to stand.
I've been doing this since I was a child.

400
00:18:49,461 --> 00:18:52,339
All right,
our guests will enter here as always.

401
00:18:52,422 --> 00:18:55,634
The reception line is here with the three
of you greeting the guests first.

402
00:18:55,717 --> 00:18:57,302
Shake, shake, shake. Smile, smile, smile.

403
00:18:57,386 --> 00:18:58,887
Peter and I will be there.

404
00:18:58,971 --> 00:19:01,306
Yeah, shake, shake, shake.
Smile, smile, smile.

405
00:19:01,390 --> 00:19:02,724
[keypad clacking]

406
00:19:06,603 --> 00:19:08,605

00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,370
[curious music playing]

408
00:19:24,955 --> 00:19:26,957
[tense music building]

409
00:19:32,713 --> 00:19:34,423
[music intensifies, ends]

410
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,049
[women] Champagne, champagne, champagne.

411
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:40,012
And then Peter gives his opening remarks.
Do you need a refresh on the lines?

412
00:19:40,095 --> 00:19:41,680
-[phone chimes]
-No.

413
00:19:41,763 --> 00:19:46,310
And then Peter introduces me,
and I give the annual gala toast.

414
00:19:46,393 --> 00:19:47,686
-[phone chimes]
-Clap, clap, clap.

415
00:19:47,769 --> 00:19:49,771
Hey, do we have a pack and play?

416
00:19:49,855 --> 00:19:51,648
-What?
-[Peter] I just heard.

417
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,567
Sarah and Rory are coming.

418
00:19:53,650 --> 00:19:55,319
They're bringing
their spouses and the baby.

419
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:57,321
They're asking if we have a pack and play.

420
00:19:57,404 --> 00:19:59,907
-We can get a pack and play, right?
-[Missy] Of course, sir.

421
00:19:59,990 --> 00:20:01,033
What's a pack and play?

422
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:03,452
It's a pop-up portable crib that--

423
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,245
Your… Your kids are… Your kids are coming?

424
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:06,371
-Where?
-Here.

425
00:20:06,455 --> 00:20:08,749
I offered to send them the plane.
I told you last night.

426
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:11,210
No… No, you didn't.
We're gonna have an infant at the gala?

427
00:20:11,293 --> 00:20:12,169
Not an infant.

428
00:20:12,252 --> 00:20:14,671
Our infant.
He can join the receiving line.

429
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:16,548
It's gonna be like old times.
The whole family.

430
00:20:16,632 --> 00:20:19,384
Do they have black tie
on such short notice?

431
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:20,552
-Uh…
-[phone chiming]

432
00:20:20,636 --> 00:20:22,846
I just told them to wear whatever.

433
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,765
Hello, hi.

434
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,934
[chuckling] Yeah.

435
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,144
Yeah, she's… she's very excited.

436
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:30,520
We both are.

437
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:32,231
[pensive music playing]

438
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,483
Jose, would you come with me
to Simone's room, please?

439
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:36,109
I would love to.

440
00:20:37,319 --> 00:20:38,403
[Peter chuckling]

441
00:20:43,325 --> 00:20:44,451
[music fades]

442
00:20:49,873 --> 00:20:51,875
-[Michaela] It's time to go.
-Kiki, this isn't…

443
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:54,503
-This is not what it looks like.
-Please leave quietly.

444
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,047
No, but this isn't an accurate
representation of what happened.

445
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,758
I pushed… I pushed him away. I… I ran.

446
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:01,134
It doesn't matter.

447
00:21:01,218 --> 00:21:04,012
But he… he kissed me.
I was as stunned as you are.

448
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,889
No, Simone,
you are not as stunned as I am.

449
00:21:05,973 --> 00:21:07,724
I didn't know I could feel
this level of hurt.

450
00:21:07,808 --> 00:21:09,643
There is nothing going on between us.

451
00:21:09,726 --> 00:21:12,646
He made a mistake,
and he immediately owned up to it.

452
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,314
Then why did you hide it from me?

453
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:16,441
Because I knew
that it would devastate you.

454
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:19,403
And I… I actually, like…

455
00:21:20,570 --> 00:21:23,699
I live my life not to devastate you.

456
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:26,493
Well…

457
00:21:29,204 --> 00:21:30,330
Kiki, please.

458
00:21:31,498 --> 00:21:32,416
[inhales sharply]

459
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:35,585
Please, I was…
I was following him, like you asked,

460
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,170
and… and he saw me.

461
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:39,047
[spluttering] Like, you know Peter.

462
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:42,134
Like, that's how… that's how you two met.
He came on to you too.

463
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,343
Jocelyn was not my friend.

464
00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,472
You are my best friend,
and now you're a threat to my marriage,

465
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:51,018
and you've put everything I have built
at risk, and so now you have to go.

466
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:52,686
Kiki, please.

467
00:21:53,270 --> 00:21:58,400
Jose will give you the termination papers
and the updated NDA to sign in the car,

468
00:21:58,483 --> 00:22:03,113
and we will never speak
to anyone about this again.

469
00:22:03,196 --> 00:22:04,406
Kiki, please.

470
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,992
Please, don't do this.

471
00:22:07,909 --> 00:22:09,745
Can I have your phone, please?

472
00:22:11,580 --> 00:22:13,582
[somber music playing]

473
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,586
And the photo?

474
00:22:23,133 --> 00:22:24,593
Kiki, you're killing me.

475
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:30,807
I'm so sorry.

476
00:22:37,898 --> 00:22:39,316
Jose, will you take her?

477
00:22:39,399 --> 00:22:41,401
[somber music continues]

478
00:22:50,285 --> 00:22:51,203
[gasps]

479
00:23:10,472 --> 00:23:11,807
[music fades]

480
00:23:11,890 --> 00:23:12,974
[Devon sighs]

481
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,353
There's only four hotels
on the entire island.

482
00:23:16,436 --> 00:23:17,562
He's not at any of them.

483
00:23:17,646 --> 00:23:20,190
Ow! Watch where you poke, bud.

484
00:23:20,273 --> 00:23:21,900
-Sorry, Mr. DeWitt.
-[Devon sighs]

485
00:23:21,983 --> 00:23:25,320
He's not at the hospital 'cause
I would've seen him. Where the hell is he?

486
00:23:26,780 --> 00:23:28,698
-[sighs]
-What do you think of this getup?

487
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,035
Oh, Dad.

488
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:33,745
-Hmm?
-You look wonderful.

489
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:35,914
-It's not wearing me?
-No.

490
00:23:36,415 --> 00:23:38,834
You are wearing it. Very dapper.

491
00:23:39,459 --> 00:23:42,087
[man] Do you want to see
some cummerbund and tie options?

492
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:44,089
Yeah, let's see those. Thanks, Kenny.

493
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,845
What time does this thing start today?

494
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:52,305
Um, pre-gala drinks start at 5.

495
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,349
When do we go home?

496
00:23:54,433 --> 00:23:56,268
Tomorrow is the plan.

497
00:23:56,351 --> 00:24:00,188
Um, but I… have something
I want to run by you.

498
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,607
-Uh-oh.
-No, it's a good thing, I think.

499
00:24:02,691 --> 00:24:06,820
Uh, I… I met this guy
on the island, and, um--

500
00:24:06,903 --> 00:24:08,405
You and your men all the time.

501
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,282
Rude.

502
00:24:11,741 --> 00:24:13,743
-Can I continue?
-Mm-hmm.

503
00:24:14,744 --> 00:24:17,164
His name's Morgan, and he's, uh,

504
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:21,960
the captain of this big ship,
and he invited me on a trip with him.

505
00:24:22,461 --> 00:24:23,462
Sailor, huh?

506
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,422
Yeah, the trip takes, like, a month.

507
00:24:26,214 --> 00:24:27,048
A month?

508
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:31,261
[clicks tongue]

509
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:32,762
-Never mind.
-Wait a sec.

510
00:24:32,846 --> 00:24:34,055
No, it's a stupid idea.

511
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:35,223
Do you like this guy?

512
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,225
[breathes deeply]

513
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,604
-I can't leave you alone for that long.
-Sure, you can.

514
00:24:41,521 --> 00:24:43,815
-Pfft.
-Who's gonna give you your medication?

515
00:24:43,899 --> 00:24:45,025
The VA.

516
00:24:45,108 --> 00:24:48,236
They'll mail it to the house.
I just gotta fill out some forms.

517
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:52,032
You won't go outside.
You'll just drink too much and smoke.

518
00:24:52,115 --> 00:24:56,536
Hey, the way I spend my remaining years
is up to me, so fuck off.

519
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:58,955
You should go.

520
00:25:00,415 --> 00:25:03,585
Your sister, she's got these rich dicks
lapping out of her hand.

521
00:25:04,211 --> 00:25:05,170
[scoffs]

522
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:06,254
[inhales deeply]

523
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,089
You don't owe me shit.

524
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,800
[Kenny] Okay, Mr. DeWitt.

525
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,135
Pick your poison.

526
00:25:12,219 --> 00:25:13,220
[Bruce] Hmm.

527
00:25:18,391 --> 00:25:19,434
Excellent choice.

528
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:22,479
Let me see about a pocket square now.

529
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,857
-[exhales]
-[Devon laughs]

530
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:31,404
You mean it?

531
00:25:32,614 --> 00:25:34,783
-You'd be okay for a month?
-It's no big deal.

532
00:25:34,866 --> 00:25:35,742
Pfft!

533
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,785
I'll be fine.

534
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,829
Yeah, I mean, it's just a month, right?

535
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:41,957
Exactly.

536
00:25:42,499 --> 00:25:43,458
[chuckles]

537
00:25:45,877 --> 00:25:47,504
I love you, Simone.

538
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:51,466
Dad.

539
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:54,719
I'm Devon.

540
00:26:01,393 --> 00:26:03,603
[pensive music playing]

541
00:26:04,646 --> 00:26:05,647
Are you okay?

542
00:26:06,773 --> 00:26:08,066
[inhales deeply]

543
00:26:08,149 --> 00:26:10,944
I know we were talking
about something important

544
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:14,030
that really matters to you.

545
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,494
But I… [exhales]

546
00:26:20,662 --> 00:26:21,621
[exhales sharply]

547
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,582
It's okay.

548
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,251
-It's okay.
-I'm so sorry.

549
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,503
-It's okay. It's okay.
-[breathing heavily]

550
00:26:29,546 --> 00:26:31,715
[somber music playing]

551
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:37,762
I'm in hell.

552
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,224
[Bruce exhales deeply]

553
00:26:41,808 --> 00:26:43,768
[footsteps approaching]

554
00:26:43,852 --> 00:26:45,270
Oh, Missy, hey.

555
00:26:48,356 --> 00:26:49,399
What's going on?

556
00:26:49,983 --> 00:26:51,359
I'm here to help you pack.

557
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,323
[humming]

558
00:26:58,533 --> 00:27:02,621
Okay. Let us get this show on the road.

559
00:27:02,704 --> 00:27:05,915
[inhales] You want to listen
to some tunes, huh? While we drive?

560
00:27:06,833 --> 00:27:07,667
Simone?

561
00:27:13,923 --> 00:27:15,592
You okay back there, Simone?

562
00:27:20,096 --> 00:27:21,181
[clears throat]

563
00:27:21,264 --> 00:27:22,098
Okay.

564
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,267
[engine starts]

565
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:31,941
[pensive music playing]

566
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,239
-[engine stops]
-[car door opens]

567
00:27:38,323 --> 00:27:40,742
-Dad, I told you to change.
-[car door closes]

568
00:27:40,825 --> 00:27:42,285
I choose to wear this.

569
00:27:42,869 --> 00:27:45,997
Okay. Hey, what the fuck's going on?
Why are we getting kicked out?

570
00:27:46,081 --> 00:27:50,126
Uh, I'm afraid your sister was let go,
so I'm here to take you to the ferry.

571
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:51,169
What?

572
00:27:51,961 --> 00:27:54,089
-What do you mean? She got fired?
-Yeah.

573
00:27:55,674 --> 00:27:56,508
Simone.

574
00:27:57,092 --> 00:27:58,426
Simone, what happened?

575
00:28:01,096 --> 00:28:02,055
Simone.

576
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:08,520
-What did you do to her?
-[Jose] Me? I… Nothing. I…

577
00:28:09,104 --> 00:28:10,313
She must just be in shock.

578
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,524
[Devon] Well, yeah,
that job was her entire personality.

579
00:28:12,607 --> 00:28:14,526
-Why did she get fired?
-Something about a theft.

580
00:28:14,609 --> 00:28:15,652
Theft?

581
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,028
[phone chiming]

582
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,740
Simone wouldn't steal a gumball.
She's never been in trouble in her life.

583
00:28:20,824 --> 00:28:22,409
Fuck, it's the police. Hello?

584
00:28:23,910 --> 00:28:25,662
Uh, are we going to the gala?

585
00:28:25,745 --> 00:28:27,247
[Devon] So, um…

586
00:28:27,330 --> 00:28:28,164
No.

587
00:28:28,832 --> 00:28:30,208
Sorry. Uh…

588
00:28:30,291 --> 00:28:33,962
Unfortunately, no. But you know what?
It wasn't even going to be fun anyway, so…

589
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:35,380
[blows raspberry]

590
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,674
So, I'm not going to meet Jim Kelly?

591
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,848
-Come on, Devon.
-[horn honking]

592
00:28:44,931 --> 00:28:48,017
I'm coming! No, not you. I'm coming.
We'll be right there. Fuck.

593
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:49,436
Bye.

594
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:50,979
[intriguing music playing]

595
00:28:51,604 --> 00:28:52,731
[Devon sighs]

596
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,190
Good news. Ray's alive.

597
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:56,443
Bad news. He's in the drunk tank.

598
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,237
Can we make a pit stop
at the police station on the way out?

599
00:28:59,904 --> 00:29:02,282
-You Buffalo people know how to party.
-[engine starts]

600
00:29:02,365 --> 00:29:04,367
[dramatic music playing]

601
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:07,203
[music ends]

602
00:29:07,287 --> 00:29:09,372
[chuckling] Oh, very nice, sir.

603
00:29:09,456 --> 00:29:11,458
Thank you, Patrice. Have you seen Jose?

604
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:14,461
Uh, no, I believe
he's running some errands for Mrs. Kell.

605
00:29:14,544 --> 00:29:16,546
-Is there something I can help you with?
-Uh…

606
00:29:16,629 --> 00:29:19,674
I was going to have him collect
Rory and Sarah from the airport.

607
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:22,761
-Did I tell you that they're coming?
-Yes. It's so exciting.

608
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,680
You want me to have, uh,
maybe Carl or Eddy pick them up?

609
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:28,433
No, that's okay.
I'll just have Simone book a car.

610
00:29:29,184 --> 00:29:30,685
Simone's not up there, sir.

611
00:29:31,186 --> 00:29:33,062
Mrs. Kell let her go this morning.

612
00:29:34,522 --> 00:29:35,398
She what?

613
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,484
[dramatic music playing]

614
00:29:38,943 --> 00:29:40,445
[indistinct chatter]

615
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:47,786
[door slams]

616
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:49,954
You fired Simone?

617
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:52,165
Ah, yes, I did. So?

618
00:29:52,874 --> 00:29:54,667
So I'm surprised. Why?

619
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:56,711
I don't trust her.

620
00:30:00,131 --> 00:30:03,510
Didn't you just decide
to promote her yesterday?

621
00:30:03,593 --> 00:30:06,596
She works for me, so it's my decision,

622
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,223
and it's my business.

623
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,725
Okay, but I'm surprised
we didn't talk about this.

624
00:30:10,809 --> 00:30:12,101
What is there to talk about?

625
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:13,770
You two are close. You're like sisters.

626
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:18,066
[spluttering] And it seems
especially cold to fire her

627
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:21,236
moments after we hear
about her hellacious childhood,

628
00:30:21,319 --> 00:30:24,447
and her father is here,
and Ethan falls off a cliff.

629
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,448
[inhales deeply]

630
00:30:25,532 --> 00:30:27,283
It's a little monstrous, actually.

631
00:30:27,367 --> 00:30:30,328
She stole my earrings.
I caught her red-handed.

632
00:30:31,996 --> 00:30:32,956
What earrings?

633
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:34,374
These.

634
00:30:38,837 --> 00:30:41,548
You lend her your jewelry all the time.

635
00:30:41,631 --> 00:30:43,299
You dress her up like a doll.

636
00:30:43,383 --> 00:30:45,552
It makes no sense
that she would steal those.

637
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:48,513
Well, I don't know why
she did what she did,

638
00:30:48,596 --> 00:30:52,141
but she was disrespecting my property
and taking what was mine,

639
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,978
and I won't have it. So we're done.

640
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,813
Okay, so that's it. She's just gone.

641
00:30:56,896 --> 00:30:58,982
You seem awfully concerned
about this girl.

642
00:31:01,401 --> 00:31:04,445
Well, I… I think she's got a good heart.

643
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:05,738
She has a wonderful heart.

644
00:31:05,822 --> 00:31:08,950
And the truth is I love her,
but I don't get to have her, do I, Pete?

645
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:10,952
[somber music playing]

646
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,413
We don't always get to have what we love.

647
00:31:22,797 --> 00:31:25,133
[door opens, closes]

648
00:31:25,925 --> 00:31:28,136
[pills rattling]

649
00:31:30,096 --> 00:31:32,348
-[indistinct radio chatter]
-[door opens]

650
00:31:34,434 --> 00:31:36,311
Miss DeWitt. Come on in.

651
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:41,983
Thank God. Get me out of here.

652
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,152
Oh my God, Lily, is that you? Lily!

653
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:46,946
[yelps] Kevin! Oh my God.

654
00:31:47,030 --> 00:31:48,323
I have missed you, mama.

655
00:31:48,406 --> 00:31:51,868
I tried to find you on Instagram,
but I lost my phone in the bath.

656
00:31:51,951 --> 00:31:54,287
How's the cult rescue going?
I've been worried sick.

657
00:31:54,370 --> 00:31:57,665
-So good. What are you doing here?
-[Lily-Rose] I don't know.

658
00:31:58,249 --> 00:32:00,793
I'm just trying
to make this stallion my steed.

659
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,503
-Don't breathe on me.
-[chuckles] I'm not.

660
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:03,922
-Could you not?
-[chuckles]

661
00:32:04,005 --> 00:32:08,301
This absolute king washed up
at the wedding I was at last night.

662
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:10,720
He walked out of the water
completely naked

663
00:32:10,803 --> 00:32:12,680
like Daryl Hannah in Splash.

664
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:15,934
Fortunately, we have clothes
in the lost and found for the drunks.

665
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:18,728
I told you I was not drunk.
I had hypothermia.

666
00:32:18,811 --> 00:32:20,813
-I have hypothyroid.
-[Devon, softly] Oh God.

667
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:22,482
[Lily-Rose sighs]

668
00:32:22,565 --> 00:32:25,276
I had the most traumatic experience
of my life last night.

669
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,611
Oh, this story again.

670
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,321
I'll get his release paperwork.

671
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:30,573
-I got caught in a riptide.
-Thank you.

672
00:32:30,657 --> 00:32:32,533
One minute, I'm in the shallow water.

673
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,704
Then the next, I'm a mile from shore
in this crazy current,

674
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:40,249
and I'm just getting pounded
and pounded on the rocks.

675
00:32:40,333 --> 00:32:41,751
I thought I was gonna die.

676
00:32:41,834 --> 00:32:43,962
That's very dramatic.
I'm glad you're okay.

677
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:46,631
[Ray] And then I had an epiphany.

678
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:50,051
The dark current is you.

679
00:32:50,134 --> 00:32:51,260
[unsettling music playing]

680
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:52,178
You.

681
00:32:52,261 --> 00:32:54,138
You have this crazy pull over me.

682
00:32:54,222 --> 00:32:56,516
What am I even doing
on this island, Devon?

683
00:32:57,100 --> 00:32:59,268
I almost made my wife a widow last night,

684
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,980
nearly left my son fatherless
because of you.

685
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:04,524
No. No, Ray.
I didn't invite you to this island.

686
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:07,777
You chose to be here.
You chose to go swimming naked.

687
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:09,988
No. You did this to me.

688
00:33:10,071 --> 00:33:11,072
You did this.

689
00:33:11,155 --> 00:33:13,241
-Do you want me to slap him?
-[Ray] I wanna go home.

690
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:16,119
I wanna be with Allie and Mason.
That's what my life is about.

691
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:18,204
I want to go home.

692
00:33:19,914 --> 00:33:21,624
I gotta tell you something, Ray.

693
00:33:21,708 --> 00:33:23,209
[dramatic sting]

694
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:26,170
[Devon] Yeah, well, I'm sorry.
I thought you were fucking dead.

695
00:33:26,254 --> 00:33:28,047
[Ray] Why would you answer
a dead man's phone?

696
00:33:28,131 --> 00:33:29,507
[Devon] She called, like, 14 times.

697
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,509
[Ray] It doesn't matter
how many times she called.

Stop kicking my bucket, you animal.

700
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:35,805
-Jose, would you mind?
-Yep.

701
00:33:35,888 --> 00:33:39,142
-[Ray] We've been doing this for 30 years.
-[Devon] Who walks into the ocean naked?

702
00:33:39,225 --> 00:33:40,309
[Ray] You told me to.

703

Can you hear me, Simone?

[chuckles softly]

708
00:34:02,457 --> 00:34:03,291
No?

[breathes deeply]

710
00:34:06,586 --> 00:34:08,796
I don't even remember why we're here.

[sighs]

712
00:34:13,426 --> 00:34:16,387
I forget all the things
that I want to remember

713
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:19,515
and remember all the things
I want to forget.

714
00:34:21,225 --> 00:34:26,147
Like the face of the police officer
when she came to take you away.

715
00:34:26,647 --> 00:34:29,442
And the way that she said,

716
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:32,195
"Did you forget
there was a child in here?"

717
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:37,450
I didn't feed you.

718
00:34:37,950 --> 00:34:40,703
I left you all alone
in your room for so long.

[Bruce] Uh…

721
00:34:43,122 --> 00:34:45,708
I shut the door when you called out to me.

722
00:34:49,212 --> 00:34:50,338
I'm sorry, Simone.

723
00:34:54,342 --> 00:34:55,218
I'm sorry.

724
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:57,261
Hey.

725
00:34:58,638 --> 00:35:00,264
Devon is going away,

726
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,559
and it's gonna be you and me again.

727
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:07,730
And… I will do better this time.

728
00:35:07,814 --> 00:35:10,817
[unsettling music playing]

729
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:13,736
Simone.

730
00:35:16,197 --> 00:35:17,031
Simone.

[music intensifies]

732
00:35:23,412 --> 00:35:27,083

[Peter] I'm sorry that you got fired.

I know it's my fault,
and I'm gonna fix it.

I don't want to work here anymore anyway.

But, um…

780
00:39:31,577 --> 00:39:33,704

[Peter] Where are you right now?

784
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,720
I'm driving in my car. Why, what's up?

785
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:51,263
[Peter] Are you alone?

786
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,891
Uh, no, no, I'm with Bruce and, uh, Devon

787
00:39:53,974 --> 00:39:57,853
and you know, the… the nurse.
Why, what's up? You need something?

788
00:39:58,729 --> 00:40:00,898
[Peter] Yeah. Can you take me off speaker?

Yeah.

Yeah, sure, of course. Okay.

Later, D.

Excuse me. I'll be right back.

838

Would you excuse me for just a moment?

839
00:43:19,555 --> 00:43:21,765
-What are you doing here?
-Where's Simone? Is she here?

840
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,226
No, I thought she'd be
on the ferry with you by now.

841
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,353
-Shit, we lost her.
-She isn't with Jose?

842
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,438
No, she took off.

843
00:43:28,022 --> 00:43:31,317
By the way,
you got some big nerve firing her.

844
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,902
-Um, would you find Peter for me, please?
-[Lisa] Of course.

845
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:36,488
You know, Simone doesn't even take
free samples at Trader Joe's.

846
00:43:36,572 --> 00:43:39,199
She works her ass off
for everything she has.

847
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:41,243
And she is devastated right now

848
00:43:41,327 --> 00:43:44,288
because she worships
the ground you walk on, you stupid bitch.

849
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:47,916
-You don't know what you're talking about.
-You prance around here saving birds,

850
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:50,961
telling my sister that she belongs here
and that you're her friend,

851
00:43:51,045 --> 00:43:53,464
and then you rip it away for what,
because you felt like it?

852
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:56,342
-Could you keep your voice down?
-Oh, you want me to keep my voice down?

853
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,093
Will you ping Jose for me? Thank you.

854
00:43:58,177 --> 00:44:01,055
[Devon] I've had your number
since day fucking one.

855
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:04,475
That's right. Me. I have.
You know what you are?

856
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:10,230
You're a megalomaniac,
cult leader, slut, whore, and a murderer.

858
00:44:11,273 --> 00:44:14,234
Yeah, that's right. We all know
what you did to Jocelyn, babe.

859
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:20,324
[inhales deeply] Jocelyn Kell lives
on an island off Washington state.

860
00:44:20,407 --> 00:44:23,619
She's a recluse who hasn't been seen
in public for over ten years

861
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:28,957
because she was disfigured
by plastic surgery after the divorce.

862
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:32,002
An injection hit an artery
causing necrosis,

863
00:44:32,086 --> 00:44:35,089
which means that half of her face
is dead flesh, and she's blind in one eye.

864
00:44:35,756 --> 00:44:39,051
[inhales deeply] It's very sad.
She's in agony most of the time,

865
00:44:39,134 --> 00:44:42,721
and we try to respect her privacy
by not speaking about her publicly.

866
00:44:44,431 --> 00:44:45,265
Oh.

867
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,519
Is there anything else
you'd like to air out

868
00:44:48,602 --> 00:44:51,188
in front of our friends
before Jose sees you out?

869
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:53,899
-No, that's it.
-[Michaela] Thank you.

870
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:56,610

-Where is Jose?
-Okay, I'll see myself out.

873
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,950
[suspenseful music playing]

874
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:04,993
It's done.

875
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,996
-Good work. Thank you, my friend.
-Of course. [chuckles]

876
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:09,415
Pedro.

877
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,545
Are you sure you want to do this again?

878
00:45:15,421 --> 00:45:16,380
I'm sure.

879
00:45:17,423 --> 00:45:19,007
It might get messy, you know.

880
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,427
That's why I have you.

881
00:45:23,387 --> 00:45:24,763
Yeah. [chuckles]

882
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:31,895
[inhales deeply] Ay, Dios.

883
00:45:32,438 --> 00:45:35,023
On Instagram,
he can't stop saying "bacon pancakes."

884
00:45:35,107 --> 00:45:36,734
-No. No.
-He says it all the time.

885
00:45:36,817 --> 00:45:38,819
That's astonishing.
You would never think--

886
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,529
-Michaela.
-Uh… Oh.

887
00:45:40,612 --> 00:45:43,323
-I need to talk to you.
-But I'm… I'm in the middle of something.

888
00:45:43,407 --> 00:45:44,533
Right now, please.

889
00:45:45,033 --> 00:45:47,244
Please excuse me. I'll be right back.

890
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:54,251
Can you give us the room, please, folks?
Thank you very much.

891
00:45:56,879 --> 00:46:00,174
What is it? Wh-- What's so important
that we need to speak about it now?

892
00:46:00,257 --> 00:46:01,258
I'm not happy.

893
00:46:02,718 --> 00:46:05,304
I don't think
I've ever been happy in this marriage.

894
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,557
Is this about my reaction
to your kids coming?

895
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,019
Because I admit, I was surprised,
but I'm… I'm excited now.

896
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:13,687
I'm… I'm excited to see them.

897
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,648
You have systematically discouraged me

898
00:46:16,732 --> 00:46:21,528
from knowing my own children
for over a decade.

899
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:24,573
-As much as I have tried to convince--
-Oh my God, this again?

900
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,950
You ruined your relationship
with your children.

901
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,244
You pursued me.

902
00:46:29,328 --> 00:46:32,790
You left Jocelyn.
You let them demonize me.

903
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,500
-I'm letting you go, Kiki.
-[scoffs]

904
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,753
What are you even talking about?
We're in the middle of the gala.

905
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:40,839
I'm sorry if this is abrupt,

906
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:43,634
but now that I've seen it,
I cannot unsee it.

907
00:46:44,218 --> 00:46:45,219
See what?

908
00:46:45,302 --> 00:46:49,097
You were gonna spend the rest of the day,
the rest of our lives,

909
00:46:49,598 --> 00:46:53,644
with incriminating photos of me
hidden in a safe.

910
00:46:53,727 --> 00:46:54,728
[sighs]

911
00:46:55,604 --> 00:46:56,688
Simone told you.

912
00:46:56,772 --> 00:47:00,692
Yes. Simone cared enough
about me to warn me.

913
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,652
Yes.

914
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,112
And now those photos have been destroyed.

915
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:06,323
I wasn't going to do anything with them.
They were just…

916
00:47:06,406 --> 00:47:07,866
It was just an insurance policy.

917
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,994
Good marriages don't need
an insurance policy.

918
00:47:11,078 --> 00:47:11,912
Ours does.

919
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:13,831
You and your lawyers made sure of that.

920
00:47:13,914 --> 00:47:15,082
I gave up my career for you,

921
00:47:15,165 --> 00:47:18,669
and you gave me a prenup
that only values my fucking ovaries!

922
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:23,340
The aviary is mine. I want it.

923
00:47:23,423 --> 00:47:26,260
No one knows how
to take care of those birds but me.

924
00:47:28,053 --> 00:47:29,388
Simone knows.

925
00:47:32,558 --> 00:47:34,726
Don't be the fool
that fucks the assistant.

926
00:47:36,895 --> 00:47:38,564
[clicks tongue] It's not about Simone.

927
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,066
It's about me

928
00:47:42,317 --> 00:47:44,820
wanting love and light in my life.

929
00:47:44,903 --> 00:47:48,866
About me needing to feel like my journey

930
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:52,995
on this planet has been rich
and worthwhile

931
00:47:54,246 --> 00:47:56,331
and… and full of goodness.

932
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:58,542
You're a walking cliché.

933
00:47:58,625 --> 00:48:01,628
I want my kids, my grandkids,

934
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,171
running around in here.

935
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:07,593
I may even decide to have
another baby of my own. Who knows?

936
00:48:08,176 --> 00:48:10,804
Having a baby
won't make you any younger, Pete.

937
00:48:13,515 --> 00:48:14,433
[Peter] Hmm.

938
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,686
Yeah, I think, uh,

939
00:48:18,645 --> 00:48:21,773
we should let our lawyers
handle the rest of this conversation.

940
00:48:22,858 --> 00:48:23,692
Jose?

941
00:48:26,987 --> 00:48:28,113
[Michaela] Oh, I…

942
00:48:28,196 --> 00:48:30,324
Um, no, I can… [sniffles]

943
00:48:30,407 --> 00:48:32,701
I can see myself out.
That's… [inhales deeply]

944
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,328
[footsteps approaching]

945
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,371
[unsettling music playing]

946
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:41,376
[inhales deeply]

947
00:48:41,960 --> 00:48:45,547
Don't you look beautiful
in that dress I had made for you?

948
00:48:47,966 --> 00:48:48,800
Hey hey.

949
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,935
[tender music playing]

950
00:49:01,605 --> 00:49:04,483
You really do look lovely.

951
00:49:05,317 --> 00:49:07,527
[Jose] I'd like to second that,
Miss DeWitt.

952
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:09,196
Very striking,

953
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:11,406
mi amor.

954
00:49:15,243 --> 00:49:16,536
Thank you, Jose.

955
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:18,830
Excuse me.

956
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,918
[music fades]

957
00:49:29,800 --> 00:49:30,884
[exhales]

958
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:32,803
You okay?

959
00:49:34,471 --> 00:49:35,305
Are you?

960
00:49:36,556 --> 00:49:37,391
Yeah.

961
00:49:40,268 --> 00:49:42,270
[tender music playing]

962
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:02,958
[inaudible]

963
00:50:06,461 --> 00:50:07,421
Hey.

964
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:10,549
Hey, where's…

965
00:50:11,633 --> 00:50:12,759
where's your dress?

966
00:50:13,343 --> 00:50:14,469
What are you doing?

967
00:50:15,095 --> 00:50:16,096
What do you mean?

968
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:18,974
You're with Peter now?

969
00:50:19,057 --> 00:50:21,935
Oh, yeah, it, like…
it, like, just happened.

970
00:50:22,019 --> 00:50:26,231
Um, look, my hands are still shaking.
We found each other on the beach.

971
00:50:26,314 --> 00:50:27,733
Oh God, like magnets.

972
00:50:27,816 --> 00:50:30,152
We had this whole conversation,
and then at the end,

973
00:50:30,235 --> 00:50:32,404
I was like, "Okay, bye,"

974
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:36,950
and then he was like… [chuckles]
"Wait, I need to tell you something."

975
00:50:37,034 --> 00:50:38,660
"I think I'm in love with you."

976
00:50:39,244 --> 00:50:42,164
-And then once he said it, I--
-What about Michaela?

977
00:50:43,707 --> 00:50:44,791
What about Michaela?

978
00:50:48,170 --> 00:50:49,588
If it doesn't serve you,

979
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,631
let it go.

980
00:50:54,843 --> 00:50:55,677
Wow.

981
00:50:57,220 --> 00:50:58,263
Okay.

982
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,140
"Wow, okay." [chuckles]

983
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:05,020
What, why are you saying it like… judgy?

984
00:51:06,021 --> 00:51:07,564
You took her husband.

985
00:51:07,647 --> 00:51:09,524
He came on to me.
I didn't initiate any of this.

986
00:51:09,608 --> 00:51:12,194
What, am I not supposed to walk
through a door that opens?

987
00:51:12,277 --> 00:51:14,237
Yeah. Okay, good luck with that door.

988
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:16,490
[chuckling] Devon, wait. Come on.

989
00:51:17,532 --> 00:51:19,701
This day has been a total win.

990
00:51:19,785 --> 00:51:22,496
I'm not getting fired.
You're not going home with Dad.

991
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:23,497
Morgan is here.

992
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:26,249
He's looking smoking hot in a tux.

993
00:51:26,333 --> 00:51:29,169
Like, do you have any idea
how fun this night's gonna be?

994
00:51:29,252 --> 00:51:30,921
[clears throat] Yeah, no, I do.

995
00:51:31,505 --> 00:51:35,133
I know how fun this night will be.
I'm gonna go home with Dad.

996
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:39,679
-Devon, come on.
-I want to go home and take care of Dad.

997
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,975
Dropping out of college
to take care of you

998
00:51:45,435 --> 00:51:47,395
is the best thing I've ever done.

999
00:51:48,939 --> 00:51:52,025
I don't think you understand
how proud I am of myself

1000
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:54,152
that I did that.

1001
00:51:56,613 --> 00:51:57,864
You didn't serve me,

1002
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:00,659
and I didn't let you go.

1003
00:52:05,914 --> 00:52:07,040
But now I have to.

1004
00:52:08,583 --> 00:52:11,920
Why do you sound so dramatic? It's…

1005
00:52:12,879 --> 00:52:13,839
It's not like…

1006
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:18,301
[inhales]

1007
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:21,388
You know?
It's not like I'm not gonna see you.

1008
00:52:21,471 --> 00:52:22,806
[sobbing]

1009
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:26,143
[sniffles]

1010
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:28,979
This fall, in the city, you know?

1011
00:52:29,062 --> 00:52:32,566
[clicks tongue] I'll fly you in,
and we can get pedicures.

1012
00:52:33,692 --> 00:52:35,819
-See a show. Okay.
-Yeah, that sounds good.

1013
00:52:35,902 --> 00:52:36,736
Yeah.

1014
00:52:38,446 --> 00:52:39,447
[Simone sobbing]

1015
00:52:40,490 --> 00:52:41,366
[sniffles]

1016
00:52:41,449 --> 00:52:42,284
Okay.

1017
00:52:42,784 --> 00:52:43,660
[inhales deeply]

1018
00:52:45,537 --> 00:52:47,706
[sighs] I've gotta go. This is like…

1019
00:52:48,290 --> 00:52:50,500
-Well, it's like a whole thing, but, um…
-Mm-hmm.

1020
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:52,711
I love you.

1021
00:52:54,921 --> 00:52:56,089
You know? [sniffles]

1022
00:52:58,717 --> 00:52:59,801
I love you too.

1023
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:04,806
[inhales deeply]

[somber music playing]

1025
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:12,022
Bye. [inhales deeply]

1026
00:53:14,941 --> 00:53:16,735

[glass clinking]

1029
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,754
[Peter] Let's come together.

1030
00:53:36,630 --> 00:53:37,923
And we will begin

1031
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,967
as we used to begin

1032
00:53:42,260 --> 00:53:43,428
with my toast.

1033
00:53:43,511 --> 00:53:44,679
[guests chuckle]

1034
00:53:44,763 --> 00:53:47,265
Here's… to all of you.

1035
00:53:48,016 --> 00:53:49,309
[guests toasting]

1036
00:53:49,392 --> 00:53:51,436

[indistinct chatter]

1042
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,095
[Bruce] Don't know how good it is.

1043
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:27,973
Two creams, two sugars.

1044
00:54:29,099 --> 00:54:30,016
[Devon] Mmm.

1045
00:54:33,728 --> 00:54:34,938
-Nice.
-I remembered.

1046
00:54:35,021 --> 00:54:36,856
[chuckling] Yeah. Good job.

1047

00:54:40,402 --> 00:54:41,778
You're a good girl.

1049
00:54:44,698 --> 00:54:45,615
Thanks, Dad.

1050
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,204
I'll remember you.

1051
00:55:02,590 --> 00:55:04,342
[man over PA] Last call for boarding.

1052
00:55:04,884 --> 00:55:06,678
Last call for boarding.

1053
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:08,430
[boat horn blowing]

1054
00:55:09,347 --> 00:55:11,850
[somber music playing]

1055
00:55:13,852 --> 00:55:16,730
Hey, Dad. Don't go anywhere, okay?
I'll be right back.

1056
00:55:21,359 --> 00:55:23,361
[boat engine revving]

1057
00:55:24,279 --> 00:55:26,281
[somber music continues]

1058
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,095
Mind if I join you?

1059
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:02,692
I saw you get on the boat,
and I wanted to come say something.

1060
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:07,655
I don't know what exactly.

1061
00:56:12,702 --> 00:56:13,620
Sorry.

1062
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:16,039
I guess.

1063
00:56:16,623 --> 00:56:17,540
Sorry for what?

1064
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:19,709
Oh. [exhales]

1065
00:56:20,251 --> 00:56:22,170
Murder allegations and…

1066
00:56:23,838 --> 00:56:25,465
cult accusations.

1067
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,592
You know? Some light theft.

1068
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:30,804
Some toiletries
and a couple gold necklaces.

1069
00:56:31,888 --> 00:56:32,847
[Michaela] Hmm.

1070
00:56:36,476 --> 00:56:37,685
Apology accepted.

1071
00:56:37,769 --> 00:56:39,771
[wind whistling]

1072
00:56:45,360 --> 00:56:46,736
What are you gonna do now?

1073
00:56:47,654 --> 00:56:49,322
Oh God, I have no idea.

1074
00:56:50,073 --> 00:56:51,324
What about you?

1075
00:56:53,118 --> 00:56:54,369
Buffalo with my dad.

1076
00:56:55,662 --> 00:56:57,622
But I think I'm gonna get my own place.

1077
00:56:58,623 --> 00:57:00,834
You know, like a grown-up. [laughs]

1078
00:57:01,668 --> 00:57:02,919
Somewhere with light.

1079
00:57:06,965 --> 00:57:08,883
You should cash that check I gave you.

1080
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:10,802
Oh. [exhales]

1081
00:57:10,885 --> 00:57:14,431
No. I mean, that wouldn't be right.
It's $10,000.

1082
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:16,307
Freebies are rare in this world.

1083
00:57:17,183 --> 00:57:19,227
Cash it quick before it bounces.

1084
00:57:19,310 --> 00:57:20,228
[laughs]

1085
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:23,273
Okay.

1086
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:27,152
-Thanks, Michaela.
-Hey hey.

1087
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:28,820
[Devon laughs]

1088
00:57:30,738 --> 00:57:32,323
What is "hey hey," by the way?

1089
00:57:32,407 --> 00:57:33,908
-Oh, it's nothing.
-[chuckles]

1090
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:37,036
Just something that I… I say,
and it became a thing.

1091
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:41,124
People will do anything for you
when you're Mrs. Kell.

1092
00:57:41,207 --> 00:57:42,959
You just tell them what the rules are.

1093
00:57:46,504 --> 00:57:48,339
You think my sister's
gonna be okay with him?

1094
00:57:48,423 --> 00:57:49,257
No.

1095
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:53,052
Well, who knows? You know?

1096
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:55,847
I'm sure Jocelyn thought
the same thing about me,

1097
00:57:55,930 --> 00:57:57,474
but I had a pretty good run.

1098
00:57:57,557 --> 00:58:00,602
Took him 13 years
to decide that I was a monster.

1099
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,315
You're not a monster, Michaela.

1100
00:58:14,032 --> 00:58:15,116
Neither is she.

1101
00:58:17,702 --> 00:58:19,704
[alluring music playing]

1102
00:58:29,547 --> 00:58:31,549
[alluring vocalization]

1103
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:35,280
[music intensifies]

1104
00:59:40,410 --> 00:59:41,703
[music ends]

1105
00:59:42,870 --> 00:59:44,872
[invigorating music playing]

1106
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:33,796
[music fades]

1107
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,299
[dramatic music playing]

1108
01:01:26,307 --> 01:01:27,767
[music ends]

1109
01:01:28,601 --> 01:01:30,770
[quirky music playing]

1110
01:01:45,993 --> 01:01:47,912
[music ends]
