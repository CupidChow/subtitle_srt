[chuckling] Why would she send us fruit?

and he soared into the sky.

No, you are.

Say something dirty, but not too dirty.

180
00:11:02,453 --> 00:11:03,329
[Simone] Uh…

181
00:11:03,412 --> 00:11:04,413
Okay.

182
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,124
I wanna ride you

183
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:09,960
when you get home,

184
00:11:10,044 --> 00:11:11,003
Daddy.

185
00:11:11,087 --> 00:11:12,713
-Nice. [laughs]
-Nice.

186
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,633
We have a few time-sensitive things
for when we're back.

187
00:11:15,716 --> 00:11:18,094
-[Michaela] Like?
-Last minute gala RSVPs.

188
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:20,221
I did a pass on our revised seating chart.

189
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:22,390
-And what's the head count?
-110.

190
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,060
And John Legend agreed to do
a short set for such a good cause.

191
00:11:26,143 --> 00:11:27,603
Excellent.

192
00:11:28,396 --> 00:11:30,564
-We need to write my gala toast.
-Oh. Done.

193
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:32,233
-It's in your cloud.
-[chuckles]

194
00:11:32,316 --> 00:11:35,611
-What would I do without you?
-Uh, you would hire a new assistant?

195
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:36,529
No.

196
00:11:37,363 --> 00:11:38,197
I wouldn't.

197
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,990
You're irreplaceable.

198
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:43,077
And I don't wanna imagine a world
without you in it with me.

199
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,537
[joyful music playing]

200
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,621
Me neither, Kiki.

201
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,552
[indistinct chatter]

202
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:17,737
[Devon sighs]

203
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,659
Hey, do you happen to know
where this house is?

204
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,995
Sure, everybody knows the Cliff House.

205
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:27,413
Fare is 75 bucks.

206
00:12:27,997 --> 00:12:29,790
-Holiday pricing.
-[sighing] Oh, fuck.

207
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:31,167
Or you can walk.

208
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:35,129
Last house, way out on the point,
few miles past the lighthouse.

209
00:12:35,212 --> 00:12:38,174
-A few miles past the lighthouse?
-[driver] Yeah.

210
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:49,643
[birds screeching, chirping]

211
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,108
Hi, Joel.

212
00:12:56,734 --> 00:12:58,444
Oh, Mrs. Kell, hello.

213
00:12:58,527 --> 00:13:00,738
-How's he doing?
-Oh, he's doing amazing.

214
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,865
-Where is he? Can I see?
-Yeah, of course.

215
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:04,074
Here, come on back.

216
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:07,787
[exhales]

217
00:13:09,288 --> 00:13:10,206
All right.

218
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,373
[computer beeps]

219
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:15,544
You see, you let Barnaby out
here on Grand Point,

220
00:13:15,628 --> 00:13:16,962
and he's already here.

221
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,425
Caught a southwest wind.
He's really feeling himself.

222
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:23,511
I told you he'd be okay.

223
00:13:23,594 --> 00:13:26,388
You said it was too soon, but I know him.

224
00:13:26,472 --> 00:13:29,058
You were right.
What an amazing rehabilitation.

225
00:13:29,141 --> 00:13:32,353
Most rescue organizations,
they would have left Barnaby for dead.

226
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:35,981
We are not most rescue organizations.
Where's our new visitor?

227
00:13:36,065 --> 00:13:37,107
Right over here.

228
00:13:39,902 --> 00:13:41,320
Hi.

229
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:45,115
Hi.

230
00:13:46,158 --> 00:13:47,785
Hi there, little guy.

231
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,411
What's your name?

[gentle music playing]

233
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,123
What do you think, huh?

234
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,334
Hi.

235
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,211
Hi.

236

-Yeah.

238
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:03,843
Aw, Winston.

239
00:14:03,926 --> 00:14:05,970
We're so happy to have you.

Oh God.

252
00:14:54,727 --> 00:14:55,561
Fuck!

261
00:15:45,277 --> 00:15:47,237
Stop talking about me, Jose.

262
00:15:47,821 --> 00:15:49,823
-I'm not.
-I know you guys shit-talk me.

263
00:15:49,907 --> 00:15:51,867
On your little group text chain.

264
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:53,327
What group text chain?

267
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:01,293
Why are these blue?

268
00:16:01,377 --> 00:16:03,003
Hydrangea is blue.

269
00:16:03,087 --> 00:16:06,006
No, we wanted white or white-ish blue.

270
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:07,883
Never blue. Who signed for this?

271
00:16:07,967 --> 00:16:09,134
I don't know.

272
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:11,178
[phones ding, chime]

273
00:16:14,014 --> 00:16:14,848
Okay.

[megaphone feedback]

275
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:23,107
Listen up, everyone.
It is Labor Day weekend.

276
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,485
The Kells are entertaining every day,

277
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:30,489
and we have a black-tie event Monday.

278
00:16:31,281 --> 00:16:34,076
We need to tighten up our game, okay?

279
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:36,578
All details flow through me.

280
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:39,289
Yeah. Simone is captain now.

281
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,541
Shut up, Jose.

282
00:16:41,458 --> 00:16:43,669
-I'll get floral back over here too.
-[bicycle bell rings]

283
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:44,753
-[woman] Simone.
-What?

[brakes squeal]

285
00:16:45,754 --> 00:16:48,215
There's a transient person
at the house asking for you.

286
00:16:48,298 --> 00:16:50,467
-She's carrying hot garbage.
-[keypad clacking]

287
00:16:51,135 --> 00:16:52,136
What?

288
00:16:52,219 --> 00:16:53,887
She says she's your sister.

[softly] Oh my God. No. No, no, no.

293
00:17:08,152 --> 00:17:10,738
Do not be Devon. No. No, no, no.

294
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:13,407
No. No. No. No.

295
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,616
[breathing heavily]

296
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,701
Oh no.

297
00:17:15,784 --> 00:17:17,411
No, no, no. No.

[brakes screeching]

299
00:17:22,249 --> 00:17:23,876
No, Devon, no.

300
00:17:23,959 --> 00:17:25,961
-No. Why?
-Fuck you, you fucking bitch.

301
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:28,922
-You sent me an edible arrangement?
-How did you even get this address?

302
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,467
I told you dad got diagnosed
with early-onset dementia,

303
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,969
and you sent a fruit basket?

304
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,765
Okay, okay, I can see that you're upset,

305
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:39,725
but this is a really bad time for me
right now.

306
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:41,477
-We're about to host a reception.
-Okay.

307
00:17:41,560 --> 00:17:44,063
Well, then don't send me fruit,
you stupid bitch!

308
00:17:44,146 --> 00:17:45,355
Welcome, ladies.

309
00:17:45,439 --> 00:17:48,317
Sips and nibbles are in the back.
Thank you.

310
00:17:48,984 --> 00:17:50,194
What is this place?

311
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:52,571
And why does everyone
look like an Easter egg?

312
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:56,533
Look, Devon, I can't talk right now.
I am working.

313
00:17:56,617 --> 00:17:58,619
-I work here.
-Mmm. You are always working.

314
00:17:58,702 --> 00:18:00,704
You've been sending me
to voicemail for months.

315
00:18:00,788 --> 00:18:02,331
Yes, it's the high season.

316
00:18:02,414 --> 00:18:03,832
What the hell is a high season?

317
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:06,710
It's when society is here,
like, summering.

318
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,799
Who are you?

319
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:14,134
-Devon.
-No, seriously.

320
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,221
You're dressed like a doily.
Where are your tattoos?

321
00:18:17,304 --> 00:18:18,555
I removed them.

322
00:18:22,351 --> 00:18:23,602
Our matching sister tattoo?

323
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:25,187
It was trashy.

324
00:18:26,438 --> 00:18:27,856
It was trashy?

325
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,112
And your face is weird too, isn't it?

326
00:18:33,195 --> 00:18:35,072
-Did you do something to your face?
-No.

327
00:18:35,155 --> 00:18:35,989
Oh my God.

328
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:38,117
-You got a nose job?
-No, I…

329
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,493
When did you get a nose job?

330
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:42,663
Okay, I… I fixed my deviated septum
back in April. Kiki has a guy.

331
00:18:42,746 --> 00:18:43,664
The fuck is Kiki?

332
00:18:43,747 --> 00:18:45,415
Oh, Michaela, she's my boss.

333
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:49,419
I get to call her Kiki,
which is a… it's a really special honor.

334
00:18:49,503 --> 00:18:53,090
-[car doors closing]
-Hi, girlies. Hi, just go on back. Yeah.

-Easter egg. Easter egg. Easter egg.
-Okay.

336
00:18:58,387 --> 00:18:59,221
Devon.

337
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:00,973
You have to go.

338
00:19:01,056 --> 00:19:02,933
-[laughing] Where?
-I don't know where.

339
00:19:03,016 --> 00:19:05,227
All right? Just anywhere but here.

340
00:19:06,186 --> 00:19:08,730
Simone, I just traveled 17 hours

341
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:10,691
to see you.

342
00:19:11,441 --> 00:19:13,068
I don't know. You should've called first.

343
00:19:13,152 --> 00:19:15,404
I don't have time for you.
I don't have time for you today.

344
00:19:15,487 --> 00:19:17,030
I don't know why I didn't think of that.

345
00:19:17,114 --> 00:19:18,073
Make time.

346
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,200
Otherwise,

347
00:19:20,284 --> 00:19:23,370
I'm gonna be having sips and nibbles
with all the rest of those Barbies.

348
00:19:23,453 --> 00:19:24,288
No.

349
00:19:25,372 --> 00:19:26,290
You wouldn't.

350
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,458
Okay, fine, fine, fine.

351
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:32,963
I will hide you in the… guesthouse
until this is over.

352
00:19:34,756 --> 00:19:36,800
You, clean this up.

353

[Simone sighs]

355
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,644
Is this still their property?

356
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,313
Uh, yeah, it's a compound.

357
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:53,192
Jesus, you said they were rich,
not oligarch rich.

358
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,109
Who is this guy?

359
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:56,737
Peter Kell of the Kell Securities.

360
00:19:57,905 --> 00:19:59,239
The famous hedge fund.

361
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:01,074
Worth billions.

362
00:20:01,575 --> 00:20:02,409
Asshole.

363
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:06,163
He's actually, like, super nice.
So is Kiki.

364
00:20:06,246 --> 00:20:07,456
Yeah? What does she do?

365
00:20:07,539 --> 00:20:12,294
Well, she was a high-powered attorney,
but now she does, like, volunteer work

366
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:13,629
and animal activism.

367
00:20:13,712 --> 00:20:14,963
-Bitch. Whore.
-Devon.

368
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,007
Sorry. I have rich people Tourette's.

369
00:20:21,428 --> 00:20:24,097
Okay, uh, don't touch anything.

370
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:26,308
Don't talk… to anyone.

371
00:20:27,267 --> 00:20:31,355
Uh, don't sit on the furniture,
and don't touch the linens.

372
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:35,567
-Uh, Zeus, turn up the AC.
-[Zeus chimes]

373
00:20:35,651 --> 00:20:38,195
Yeah, cool, Georgia O'Keeffe. I have that.

374
00:20:38,278 --> 00:20:40,072
No, you don't. That's real.

375
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:42,407
-Okay, I will be back.
-When?

376
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,284
When I am done working.

377
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:47,788
Okay? Oh, you can make yourself a drink.
Not top shelf, though.

378
00:20:48,288 --> 00:20:49,122
I don't drink.

379
00:20:49,998 --> 00:20:52,376
-You don't drink? Since when?
-I'm sober.

380
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,337
I've been trying to be sober
for the past six months.

381
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:58,674
Is that why you texted me "Sirens"?

382
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,842
Not much of an SOS code
if you don't answer.

383
00:21:02,177 --> 00:21:03,595
[inhales deeply]

384
00:21:03,679 --> 00:21:05,639
Dad keeps asking me where Mom is.

385
00:21:06,974 --> 00:21:08,642
His memory's getting really bad.

386
00:21:09,142 --> 00:21:11,979
Last week he got lost
trying to get to the VA,

387
00:21:12,062 --> 00:21:15,482
and, um, the police found him
in the parking lot of a 7-Eleven.

388
00:21:15,565 --> 00:21:19,278
I have to drive him
to all of his doctor's appointments.

389
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:21,989
-I have to pick up all of his medications.
-I can send you money.

390
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:24,157
I don't want money, Simone.
I need help with Dad.

391
00:21:24,241 --> 00:21:25,158
I don't do Dad.

392
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:26,785
Tough titty. It's your job too.

393
00:21:26,868 --> 00:21:31,456
I've been… losing my mind
trying to do all of this by myself.

394
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:33,166
We have some tough choices to make.

395
00:21:33,250 --> 00:21:35,043
He's not gonna be able
to take care of himself much longer.

396
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:37,170
-That's not my problem, so.
-[Michaela] Simone.

397
00:21:37,254 --> 00:21:38,297
[both gasp]

398
00:21:38,922 --> 00:21:40,007
Who's this?

399
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,551
Kiki. Oh my God!

400
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:43,552
[laughing] Hi!

401
00:21:44,219 --> 00:21:46,054
-Our guests are congregating.
-[Simone] Uh…

402
00:21:46,847 --> 00:21:49,433
Th… This is my, uh, sister, Devon.

403
00:21:49,516 --> 00:21:51,935
She just… showed up here

404
00:21:52,019 --> 00:21:53,603
completely unannounced.

405
00:21:53,687 --> 00:21:57,441
-Did I know you had a sister?
-I'm sure I've… I've mentioned her, yeah.

406
00:21:58,525 --> 00:21:59,526
Hi.

407
00:22:00,360 --> 00:22:01,695
Hi, Devon.

408
00:22:01,778 --> 00:22:04,281
I'm Michaela… Kell.

409
00:22:05,282 --> 00:22:06,325
How's it going?

410
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,784
It's, uh…

411
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,412
It's quite the house you have here.

412
00:22:10,495 --> 00:22:12,164
Oh, quite a sister you have here.

413
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:14,958
Not a huge resemblance, is there?

414
00:22:16,168 --> 00:22:17,002
No.

415
00:22:17,502 --> 00:22:20,130
Uh, Devon looks like our dad.
I look more like our mom.

416
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:22,883
You did, before you fucked with your nose.

417
00:22:22,966 --> 00:22:23,884
[inhales deeply]

418
00:22:23,967 --> 00:22:27,304
By the way, um,
the next time one of your "guys"

419
00:22:27,387 --> 00:22:29,431
is gonna do plastic surgery on my sister,

420
00:22:29,514 --> 00:22:30,807
maybe let me know.

421
00:22:30,891 --> 00:22:33,101
People die under general anesthesia.

422
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,729
-I didn't know she was going under.
-I didn't know you existed.

423
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:37,230
Well, now you do.

424
00:22:40,901 --> 00:22:41,902
[inhales shakily]

425
00:22:41,985 --> 00:22:43,445
Wow. [laughs nervously]

426
00:22:44,029 --> 00:22:45,447
I just, um…

427
00:22:46,114 --> 00:22:49,743
I can't believe that you two
are meeting right now.

428
00:22:49,826 --> 00:22:52,037
My brain is like, "What?"

429
00:22:52,704 --> 00:22:55,374
-It's crazy.
-[Michaela] I know. It's marvelous.

430
00:22:55,457 --> 00:22:59,378
And I just wanna tell you
how much I adore this sister of yours.

431
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:02,339
-Aw.
-She is sweet and kind and good

432
00:23:02,422 --> 00:23:05,425
and we have been true-blue friends
from the minute we met.

433
00:23:05,509 --> 00:23:07,052
-Right?
-Yeah, instant besties.

434
00:23:07,135 --> 00:23:08,637
It's like a total mind merge.

435
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,805
Good for you.

436
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,474
I can't usually be friends
with people who pay me.

437
00:23:13,183 --> 00:23:14,017
Okay.

438
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,187
So, let's head over to the reception.

439
00:23:17,270 --> 00:23:19,731
-Yeah.
-And we'll let your sister unpack.

440
00:23:19,815 --> 00:23:22,984
Oh, she's not staying here.
I'm just sticking her in here for now.

441
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,403
-Okay. Mm-hmm.
-Okay.

442
00:23:24,486 --> 00:23:27,364
Yeah, I'm just gonna crash
wherever Simone lives.

443
00:23:27,447 --> 00:23:29,783
-Where do you live?
-I live here, stupid.

444
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,243
You live at work?

445
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,745
I'm a live-in assistant.
I have my own suite in the main house.

446
00:23:33,829 --> 00:23:35,997
Oh. Looks like I will be staying.

447
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:37,958
That's fine.
We're very, very happy to have you.

448
00:23:38,041 --> 00:23:40,710
Let me know where your luggage is.
I'll have it sent over, sweetheart.

449
00:23:40,794 --> 00:23:43,964
Oh, no luggage.
I'm just gonna wash my undies in the sink.

450
00:23:44,047 --> 00:23:45,090
Great.

451
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:53,849
[door closes]

452
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:56,852
[scoffs]

453
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:13,743
[inhales deeply]

454
00:24:15,454 --> 00:24:17,581
How did I not know you had a sister?

455
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,836
I don't bring her up
because she does stuff like this, like…

456
00:24:23,795 --> 00:24:28,300
She shows up, periodically, to smear
her hot mess disaster sauce all over me.

457
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,679
I'm so sorry, Kiki.

458
00:24:34,931 --> 00:24:39,269
-Do you want me to make her leave?
-No, I mean, she came all this way.

459
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:41,188
I'll get her out of here tomorrow.

460
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,731
What do you think she wants?

461
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,316
What she always wants.

462
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:46,818
To make me feel guilty
because I left Buffalo.

463
00:24:48,612 --> 00:24:49,696
Anything in my teeth?

464
00:24:50,447 --> 00:24:51,364
Nope. Me.

465
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:53,909
Perfect.

466
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,452
Breath? [exhales]

467
00:24:55,535 --> 00:24:57,204
[sniffs] Ten out of ten.

468
00:24:57,287 --> 00:24:58,914
Mine? [exhales]

469
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:00,624
Six.

470
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:02,334
Mmm. Take my gum.

471
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:04,419
[orchestral music playing]

472
00:25:05,921 --> 00:25:06,796

473
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:08,715

-[glasses clinking]
-[guests applauding]

475
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,852
OMG, Kiki, you look drop-dead.

476
00:25:20,936 --> 00:25:23,188
Predicting a major fundraising today.

477
00:25:23,271 --> 00:25:26,107
I feel alive, and also happiness.

478
00:25:26,191 --> 00:25:28,401
Let's go save some wildlife, bitches.

479
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:30,570
-[women laugh]
-[woman] Oh yeah!

480
00:25:31,363 --> 00:25:33,365

481
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:40,413

482
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,878

483
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:52,926
[sighs]

484
00:25:54,094 --> 00:25:55,345
[inhales deeply]

485
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:56,471
Hey, Ray.

486
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,140
Where the hell are you?
Your shift started two hours ago.

487
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:01,268
I'm glad you called. I need a favor.

488
00:26:01,351 --> 00:26:04,020
No, no, D. You're supposed to be
on the floor right now.

489
00:26:04,104 --> 00:26:05,355
I just sat you.

490
00:26:05,438 --> 00:26:07,524
Yeah, not gonna make it in.

491
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,985
-What do you mean?
-I had to go out of town quick.

492
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,611
Devon, this is your job.

493
00:26:11,695 --> 00:26:14,197
[hesitating] If you don't show up,
I have to fire you.

494
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,783
[sighs] Ray, you know you can't fire me.

495
00:26:16,866 --> 00:26:20,537
Listen, I need you to go to my house
and check on my dad, okay?

496
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:23,248
[Ray] What?
No fucking way. I'm not doing that.

497
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:25,250
His pajamas are in the dryer.

498
00:26:25,333 --> 00:26:28,295
Just drink a Labatt with him, you know?
Maybe help him with his butt cream.

499
00:26:28,378 --> 00:26:32,799
Hell no! I'm not babysitting your dad, D.
I have a restaurant to run.

500
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,092
I'll call your wife.

501
00:26:34,175 --> 00:26:35,844
That is not funny.

502
00:26:35,927 --> 00:26:37,679
Tell her you're my sometimes fuck boy.

503
00:26:37,762 --> 00:26:40,974
-Do not call me that. That's hurtful.
-I know her number.

504
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:42,100
No, you don't.

505
00:26:42,183 --> 00:26:45,270
716-847-1065.

506
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,026
All right, tell your dad
I'll be there before dinner.

507
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,152
[phone chimes]

508

[beeps]

511
00:27:00,702 --> 00:27:01,870
[Zeus] Hello, can I help you?

512
00:27:01,953 --> 00:27:06,207
Yeah, I'm trying to go outside
and I can't.

513
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:09,044
-So sorry about that. Here, try now.
-[door unlocks]

514
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,505
Oh, and by the way,

515
00:27:12,589 --> 00:27:15,800
there's a strict no-smoking policy
on the grounds, Miss DeWitt.

516
00:27:17,010 --> 00:27:21,222

525
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:05,141
Hello?

[dramatic sting]

527
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,728
Jesus Christ!

528
00:28:09,479 --> 00:28:11,356
Fuckety, fuck, fuck, fuck!

529
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:12,273

00:35:45,476 --> 00:35:46,561
No.

701
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,229
There's duckies on his blazer.

702
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:50,690
I… like his duckies.

703
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:52,483
No, you don't. You like his Rolex.

704
00:35:52,567 --> 00:35:56,737
Our biggest fundraiser of the year,
the Labor Day Gala, is on Monday.

705
00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:58,865
You don't know the first thing
about our relationship.

706
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:02,577
What I know, Simone, is that you've been
too busy waiting on a trophy wife

707
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,704
and fucking Mr. Duckie to show up for me.

708
00:36:04,787 --> 00:36:06,831
No. These people are my friends.

709
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:09,041
Oh, grow up, Simone. You're the help!

710
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:09,959
[Michaela] …support--

711
00:36:10,042 --> 00:36:11,169
[man clears throat]

712
00:36:12,461 --> 00:36:13,838
[Michaela] Where was I?

713
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,382
Um, the proceeds will support
the rehabilitation…

714
00:36:16,465 --> 00:36:17,300
Don't move.

715
00:36:17,383 --> 00:36:22,597
[Michaela] …of our newest resident,
Winston, the baby red-tailed hawk.

716
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:23,973
[guests applauding]

717
00:36:24,056 --> 00:36:25,600
[guests] Aw.

718
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,019
-[Michaela] Can I get a "hey hey"?
-[guests] Hey hey!

719
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:29,562
-[laughing]
-Hey hey!

720
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:30,521
Hey hey!

721
00:36:31,355 --> 00:36:33,941
[indistinct chatter]

722
00:36:45,828 --> 00:36:47,830
[pensive music playing]

723
00:36:58,299 --> 00:36:59,175
Hi.

724
00:37:01,427 --> 00:37:03,304
Let's you and me take a walk.

725
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:11,270
What do you think of the view?

726
00:37:11,354 --> 00:37:13,022
Uh, where did Simone go?

727
00:37:13,522 --> 00:37:16,734
I love to stand here and look out.

728
00:37:16,817 --> 00:37:18,861
Makes me think of Moby Dick times.

729
00:37:19,403 --> 00:37:20,238
Cool.

730
00:37:20,321 --> 00:37:22,114
All those sailors

731
00:37:22,698 --> 00:37:24,700
crashing their boats on the rocks.

732
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,535
All the blood.

733
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,581
Sometimes I think
I can still hear the whales

734
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,292
singing their mournful song.

735
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:35,211
Do you hear it?

736
00:37:35,878 --> 00:37:37,505
Mournful whale songs, yeah.

737
00:37:38,172 --> 00:37:42,176
-So listen, I really gotta find Simone.
-There she is. Thank you.

738
00:37:43,302 --> 00:37:45,930
This… is for you.

739
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:47,932
What is it?

740
00:37:48,015 --> 00:37:48,849
[Michaela] Look.

741
00:37:56,816 --> 00:37:59,318
[laughs] What is this?
Why are you giving me…

742
00:38:00,236 --> 00:38:01,070
$10,000?

743
00:38:02,321 --> 00:38:03,656
It's a gift for you.

744
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:05,950
I… [sighs]

745
00:38:07,868 --> 00:38:08,995
I don't want your money.

746
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:13,082
No, caring for aging parents
is such an expense to pay.

747
00:38:13,165 --> 00:38:14,000
No.

748
00:38:14,542 --> 00:38:17,962
No, Michaela, not okay. I didn't come here
because I want your money.

749
00:38:18,546 --> 00:38:19,672
I came here because

750
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:22,258
I want my sister…

751
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:25,303
to help me.

752
00:38:25,386 --> 00:38:27,471
And voilà. [laughs]

753
00:38:27,555 --> 00:38:28,723
-Jose.
-Sí, mi amor.

754
00:38:28,806 --> 00:38:31,517
[Michaela] Would you take Devon
to the Whaler Inn?

755
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:33,519
We have you booked in the Admiral Suite

756
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:37,064
and you are leaving
in the first flight out tomorrow morning,

757
00:38:37,148 --> 00:38:38,065
business class.

758
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:40,234
[laughing] Sorry, what?

759
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:41,694
Um…

760
00:38:43,029 --> 00:38:44,530
Are you kicking me out? Is that--

761
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:47,033
Well, it's just…
it's such a busy weekend, so…

762
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:47,950
Yeah.

763
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:50,995
Can I speak to you privately, Simone?

764
00:38:51,078 --> 00:38:53,998
I think that it's best that you go, Devon.

765
00:38:55,207 --> 00:38:56,208
Hello?

766
00:38:57,335 --> 00:39:01,005
Are you seriously gonna let
this bitch bribe me to leave?

767
00:39:01,088 --> 00:39:02,715
-[Jose] This way, please.
-[Devon] Wait.

768
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:05,343
It was terrific to meet you.

769
00:39:05,926 --> 00:39:06,969
Simone!

770
00:39:07,053 --> 00:39:08,304
Safe home.

771
00:39:08,387 --> 00:39:10,181
[Jose] Hey, let's go. Come on.

772
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:14,226
[melancholy music playing]

773
00:39:24,820 --> 00:39:26,655
[Devon sobbing softly]

774
00:39:29,367 --> 00:39:31,452
Hey, you wanna go see the old lighthouse?

775
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:35,247
It's got the best sunset view.
I can drive by if you want.

776
00:39:36,582 --> 00:39:37,416
No.

777
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:39,168
Thanks.

778
00:39:40,503 --> 00:39:42,671
Hey, come on,
don't take it so personally, huh?

779
00:39:43,923 --> 00:39:45,549
How much did they give you?

780
00:39:48,177 --> 00:39:49,470
$10,000.

781
00:39:49,553 --> 00:39:50,638
$10,000?

782
00:39:50,721 --> 00:39:51,889
Wow, that's…

783
00:39:52,473 --> 00:39:54,350
that's not bad. [chuckles]

784
00:39:55,226 --> 00:39:57,436
You know, the… the Whaler Inn is nice too.

785
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:04,193
Oh, uh, sorry, but when you can,
you know, if you… if you don't mind,

786
00:40:04,276 --> 00:40:06,070
uh, can you sign this, please?

787
00:40:06,153 --> 00:40:07,571
No, I'm not signing an NDA.

788
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,408
Well, if you don't sign it,
then it'll be like a whole thing.

789
00:40:10,491 --> 00:40:12,993
Just sign it
and forget about this place, you know?

790
00:40:19,125 --> 00:40:19,959
Good.

791
00:40:20,543 --> 00:40:21,627
[chuckles softly]

792
00:40:27,299 --> 00:40:29,051
You wanna come up front with me?

793
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:33,389
I'll let you smoke.

794
00:40:39,979 --> 00:40:43,816
You're gonna eat your words
when the Dolphins win the Super Bowl.

795
00:40:43,899 --> 00:40:46,694
Okay. No, no, no,
let me get the door for you. Come on.

796
00:40:46,777 --> 00:40:47,736
Uh…

797
00:40:48,404 --> 00:40:49,947
-You don't have to do that.
-Stay there.

798
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:53,451
The car service will be here at 8:00 a.m.
to take you to the airport.

799
00:40:55,995 --> 00:40:56,912
Hey, thanks.

800
00:40:56,996 --> 00:40:57,872
Oh, yeah.

801
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,332
Oh, no, yeah.

802
00:41:07,381 --> 00:41:09,175
-What are you doing?
-Ugh!

803
00:41:09,258 --> 00:41:12,386
-I have a wife. I have a son.
-Yeah, sorry, I'm sorry.

804
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:13,929
Ugh!

805
00:41:14,722 --> 00:41:15,598
God.

806
00:41:16,140 --> 00:41:18,267
It's a thing I… It's a thing I do.

807
00:41:18,851 --> 00:41:20,102
You lick people?

808
00:41:20,186 --> 00:41:22,021
I don't mean to do it. It's… I…

809
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,441
I don't do it on purpose.

810
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,860
I'm texting someone about it.

811
00:41:27,943 --> 00:41:29,069
Texting someone?

812
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:31,155
Yeah, I got a text therapist, you know?

813
00:41:31,655 --> 00:41:33,699
Real one's too expensive, so…

814
00:41:35,075 --> 00:41:36,410
Okay, crazy. [sighs]

815
00:41:36,494 --> 00:41:37,661
The room is under your name.

816
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,624
She put a card down for incidentals,
so go ahead and do your worst. Okay?

817
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:43,000
-Hey, Jose.
-Yeah.

818
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:46,253
I'm really sorry.

819
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:48,797
It's fine.

820
00:41:49,298 --> 00:41:50,257
Okay.

821
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,968
Don't lick nobody in there,
though, please.

822
00:41:53,052 --> 00:41:53,886
[laughs]

823
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,012
[Jose exhales]

824
00:41:55,095 --> 00:41:55,930
I won't.

825
00:41:57,973 --> 00:41:59,350
Okay. Okay.

826
00:42:02,645 --> 00:42:03,646
[Devon sighs]

827
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,440
[indistinct chatter]

828
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,526
[phone ringing]

829
00:42:13,155 --> 00:42:14,073
Oh shit.

830
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:15,074
Uh…

831
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,495
[phone chimes]

832
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,539
Hey, Dad, you okay?

833
00:42:21,622 --> 00:42:23,666
No, someone's breaking in.

834
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:27,127
No, Daddy, I texted you about this.
Remember, that's my friend Raymond.

835
00:42:27,211 --> 00:42:28,671
Remember Ray from high school?

836
00:42:28,754 --> 00:42:30,923
He's not in high school. He's old.

837
00:42:31,006 --> 00:42:31,966
I'm 32, sir.

838
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:33,592
I asked him to come check on you.

839
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,886
He's fine. He's watching war movies.
I'm gonna go.

840
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,721
No. You gotta stay
and cook the pizza for him,

841
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:39,682
and then cut it up
into little pieces, all right?

842
00:42:39,765 --> 00:42:41,225
[Ray sighs]

843
00:42:42,351 --> 00:42:43,644
When are you coming home?

844
00:42:43,727 --> 00:42:44,853
Uh…

845
00:42:45,479 --> 00:42:46,397
Tomorrow.

846
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:49,400
And, hey, in the morning, Ray's gonna
bring over your medication, okay?

847
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:50,317
[Ray] What? I am?

848
00:42:50,401 --> 00:42:52,903
Where are you, honey? I… I miss you.

849
00:42:53,529 --> 00:42:54,613
Thanks, Dad. Uh…

850
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,491
Yeah, I, uh… I'm with Simone.

851
00:42:58,075 --> 00:42:59,034
Simone?

852
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,661
Why didn't you say so?

853
00:43:01,662 --> 00:43:02,997
How's she doing?

854
00:43:03,789 --> 00:43:04,873
Great.

855
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:07,918
Yep, really good
and, uh, really excited to see me too.

856
00:43:08,002 --> 00:43:11,589
So, just, uh…
We're just having some sister time.

857
00:43:11,672 --> 00:43:13,424
Really, she's okay?

858
00:43:13,924 --> 00:43:16,969
I don't hear from her.
Does she get my emails?

859
00:43:17,052 --> 00:43:18,012
Uh… [sighs]

860
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:19,597
I… I don't know, Dad.

861
00:43:20,264 --> 00:43:22,641
Will you tell Simone that I love her?

862
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:25,978
And if she ever wants
to come home to visit,

863
00:43:26,061 --> 00:43:28,022
it would be wonderful to see her.

864
00:43:29,231 --> 00:43:30,816
I know I don't deserve it.

865
00:43:32,026 --> 00:43:33,902
Yeah, listen, I gotta go, all right?

866
00:43:33,986 --> 00:43:35,779
-I'll talk to you later. Bye.
-Wait. Wait, no.

867
00:43:38,741 --> 00:43:40,743
[whimsical music playing]

868
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:43,662
Can I help you?

869
00:43:44,747 --> 00:43:45,581
Yeah.

870
00:43:46,081 --> 00:43:47,750
Can you put all this on room 19?

871
00:43:48,334 --> 00:43:50,586
[groovy music playing]

872
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:51,503
Thanks.

873
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:54,632
[music continues]

874
00:44:25,871 --> 00:44:27,748
[bartender] All right, there you go.

875
00:44:28,374 --> 00:44:29,750
Hi. Something to drink?

876
00:44:29,833 --> 00:44:34,171
Uh, seltzer water for me
and whatever he's drinking.

877
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:36,840
You're buying me a drink?

878
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:38,342
Expense account.

879
00:44:39,343 --> 00:44:41,261
-Thank you.
-[bartender] Oh, for sure.

880
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:44,973
[chuckles]

881
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,058
[bartender] Enjoy.

882
00:44:48,185 --> 00:44:49,019
So,

883
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:50,979
where are you from?

884
00:44:51,772 --> 00:44:55,067
Can we just go,
or do you need a little small talk first?

885
00:44:55,150 --> 00:44:56,527
[laughs]

886
00:44:57,736 --> 00:45:00,739
Uh, I think I need some… some small talk.

887
00:45:00,823 --> 00:45:02,574
Oh, cute, okay. Um…

888
00:45:03,450 --> 00:45:04,368
[smacks lips]

889
00:45:04,451 --> 00:45:05,411
Christina

890
00:45:07,162 --> 00:45:09,415
Grey from Seattle.

891
00:45:09,498 --> 00:45:11,667
Uh, I'm a tech millionaire.

892
00:45:11,750 --> 00:45:12,626
-Wow.
-Yeah.

893
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,003
I feel like you just made that up.

894
00:45:15,087 --> 00:45:16,255
-Your turn.
-Okay.

895
00:45:16,797 --> 00:45:19,925
I'm Jordan St. Clair from L.A.

896
00:45:20,008 --> 00:45:23,220
-I'm in real estate and high-end sneakers…
-Ah.

897
00:45:23,303 --> 00:45:25,431
…and that's my yacht out there.

898
00:45:25,514 --> 00:45:26,515
Oh.

899
00:45:27,182 --> 00:45:31,270
I was gonna suggest my hotel room,
but a boat…

900
00:45:31,353 --> 00:45:32,271
[chuckles softly]

901
00:45:32,354 --> 00:45:33,439
That's way better.

902
00:45:34,982 --> 00:45:35,858
[chuckles]

903
00:45:36,692 --> 00:45:39,194
So, have you had enough small talk yet?

904
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:40,279
-Yeah, I'm good.
-Okay.

905
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:41,989
Can I finish my drink?

906
00:45:42,072 --> 00:45:44,158
I don't know.
Are you gonna sip it like a baby?

907
00:45:48,287 --> 00:45:49,121
[grunts]

908
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:51,248
Dock's this way.

909
00:45:51,331 --> 00:45:53,250
-Wait, you actually have a boat?
-Yeah.

910
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:55,127
And keys.

911
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:59,631
[somber vocalization]

912
00:46:08,182 --> 00:46:09,183
[lip balm clatters]

913
00:46:12,019 --> 00:46:12,978
[keypad clacking]

914
00:46:14,521 --> 00:46:15,397
[phone whooshes]

915
00:46:15,481 --> 00:46:17,483
[somber music playing]

916
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:22,821
[thunder rumbling]

917
00:46:25,949 --> 00:46:27,951
[sensual music playing]

918
00:46:29,578 --> 00:46:30,746
[kissing]

919
00:47:15,666 --> 00:47:17,668
[breathing heavily]

920
00:47:20,045 --> 00:47:21,713
[breathing heavily]

921
00:47:28,595 --> 00:47:30,681
[breathing heavily]

922
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:33,267
[moaning]

923

[breathing heavily]

926
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:51,743
[music intensifies]

927
00:48:01,044 --> 00:48:03,130
[music fades]

928
00:48:04,172 --> 00:48:05,382
[buoy bell tolling]

929
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,488
-Got something for ya.
-Ooh.

930
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:36,288
Wait, why do you have this?

931
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:41,335
Anderson's Beef on Weck.
This is my sister's sweatshirt.

932
00:48:41,418 --> 00:48:42,336
What's Beef on Weck?

933
00:48:42,419 --> 00:48:43,754
This belongs to my sister.

934
00:48:44,671 --> 00:48:45,714
How do you know Simone?

935
00:48:47,215 --> 00:48:48,467
Simone's your sister?

936
00:48:49,134 --> 00:48:50,010
Oh God.

937
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,263
-Are you dating her too? [sighs]
-No, no. [chuckles]

938
00:48:53,347 --> 00:48:57,684
Simone is… is dating my boss, Ethan.
This is his boat.

939
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,355
What? I thought this was your boat.

940
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,314
[inhales sharply]

941
00:49:02,397 --> 00:49:03,357
I'm the captain.

942
00:49:04,650 --> 00:49:07,319
Sorry. We were… [laughs]
We were doing the lying game.

943
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:09,947
Oh, I just fucked
my sister's boyfriend's boat guy

944
00:49:10,030 --> 00:49:12,240
in my sister's boyfriend's bed.

945
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,868
-Wow, sorry. Uh…
-[sighs exasperatingly]

946
00:49:14,952 --> 00:49:18,580
I wasn't lying
about being into you, though.

947
00:49:18,664 --> 00:49:22,250
We were really vibing down there,
don't you think?

948
00:49:23,251 --> 00:49:26,129
I mean, come on,
is your… is your name really Christina?

949
00:49:29,174 --> 00:49:30,509
-It's Devon.
-Yeah.

950
00:49:31,635 --> 00:49:33,679
And you're the second guy
I fucked on a boat today.

951
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:35,973
Okay.

952
00:49:37,015 --> 00:49:38,809
I think I miss the lying game.

953
00:49:40,227 --> 00:49:41,353
[phone dings]

954
00:49:43,855 --> 00:49:45,857
[keypad clacking]

955
00:49:46,608 --> 00:49:48,276
-[phone whooshes]
-[Ethan sighs deeply]

956
00:49:48,360 --> 00:49:49,319
Don't say it.

957
00:49:49,403 --> 00:49:52,072
-I have to go. I know.
-No, no, no.

958
00:49:52,614 --> 00:49:55,826
Peter's flight keeps getting delayed,
and… and Kiki's restless.

959
00:49:55,909 --> 00:49:59,204
Okay, can I…
can I talk to you about something?

960
00:49:59,287 --> 00:50:00,998
[Ethan breathes deeply]

961
00:50:01,081 --> 00:50:02,124
[chuckling] What about…

962
00:50:02,207 --> 00:50:04,167
-About what? What?
-No, it's okay.

963
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:09,756
Well, I know we kind of stumbled
past it this morning, but, um…

964
00:50:11,842 --> 00:50:14,011
I really do love you, Simone.

965
00:50:16,930 --> 00:50:17,806
[chuckles]

966
00:50:17,889 --> 00:50:19,141
I'm in love with you.

967
00:50:20,142 --> 00:50:22,060
I wanna know everything about you,

968
00:50:22,602 --> 00:50:23,854
even your childhood.

969
00:50:28,066 --> 00:50:31,319
If you love me,
you won't make me talk about this.

970
00:50:32,654 --> 00:50:35,198
Can I at least know
who your family members are?

971
00:50:35,282 --> 00:50:36,491
[inhales deeply]

972
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:41,163
Well, I had a mom,

973
00:50:42,205 --> 00:50:43,331
but she died.

974
00:50:43,957 --> 00:50:45,125
I have a dad.

975
00:50:46,251 --> 00:50:48,086
We don't speak.

976
00:50:48,795 --> 00:50:49,796
Um…

977
00:50:50,505 --> 00:50:51,465
I have a sister.

978
00:50:51,548 --> 00:50:53,508
-Ah, yeah.
-That is her.

979
00:50:53,592 --> 00:50:56,386
The rest is control-alt-delete.

980
00:50:59,222 --> 00:51:00,891
Why were you in foster care?

981
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:03,727
Please. Can we…

982
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:06,146
-Okay.
-Thank you.

983
00:51:07,481 --> 00:51:08,607
[chuckles softly]

984
00:51:08,690 --> 00:51:09,524
All right.

985
00:51:13,612 --> 00:51:16,782
But did you hear the "I'm in love
with you" part of what I said?

986
00:51:16,865 --> 00:51:18,200
[Simone chuckles]

987
00:51:18,283 --> 00:51:19,534
I love you too.

988
00:51:19,618 --> 00:51:21,870
-[Ethan] Ah.
-[chuckles]

989
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,955
[both chuckle]

990
00:51:31,254 --> 00:51:32,672
Is that the Cliff House?

991
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:34,758
Hard to miss.

992
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,511
There's a scope over there
if you wanna take a better look.

993
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:39,721
What's the deal with that place?

994
00:51:41,348 --> 00:51:43,600
-It really seems like a cult.
-Yeah. [laughs]

995
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,644
Don't let Michaela hear you say that.

996
00:51:45,727 --> 00:51:47,395
What's with all the cameras?

997
00:51:48,355 --> 00:51:51,358
And apparently she, like,
controls everything the staff eats.

998
00:51:51,441 --> 00:51:53,068
Yeah, I've heard.

999
00:51:53,652 --> 00:51:56,196
You know they call
your sister Mini Michaela, right?

1000
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,782
[pensive music playing]

1001
00:51:59,449 --> 00:52:00,742
[Devon] She does this.

1002
00:52:01,409 --> 00:52:03,161
She gets swept up in other people.

1003
00:52:03,954 --> 00:52:05,163
Loses herself.

1004
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,625
The only person
who knows the real Simone is me.

1005
00:52:08,708 --> 00:52:09,918
[Jordan] Who's the real Simone?

1006
00:52:10,418 --> 00:52:13,713
[Devon] A traumatized little girl
who's always trying to outrun her past.

1007
00:52:14,714 --> 00:52:16,550
She was really not herself today.

1008
00:52:17,759 --> 00:52:19,469
I mean, there was something, like,

1009
00:52:20,804 --> 00:52:23,682
gone… behind her eyes.

1010
00:52:23,765 --> 00:52:24,933
-You know?
-Yeah.

1011
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:26,977
Like a zombie.

1012
00:52:27,978 --> 00:52:28,812
I don't know.

1013
00:52:29,980 --> 00:52:32,983
Something just doesn't feel right
about leaving her up there.

1014
00:52:40,031 --> 00:52:41,741

Oh no! [sobs]

1025
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:35,128
No! No!

1026
00:53:35,212 --> 00:53:37,505
Barnaby! No!

1027
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:41,843
