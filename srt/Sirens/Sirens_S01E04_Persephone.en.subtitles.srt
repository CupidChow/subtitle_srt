1
00:00:06,297 --> 00:00:10,385
[bright music playing]

2
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:35,201
[seagulls cawing]

3
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:40,707
[Michaela] How was the trip over?
Choppy seas?

4
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:41,958
[Simone] No, it was gorgeous.

5
00:00:42,042 --> 00:00:44,544
This island is
the prettiest place I've ever been.

6
00:00:44,627 --> 00:00:45,712
[Michaela] Mmm.

7
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:49,007
I remember thinking that too,
the first time I saw this island.

8
00:00:51,051 --> 00:00:52,969
Your house is like an art museum.

9
00:00:53,053 --> 00:00:55,055
-[chuckles]
-[chuckling] Thank you. Yeah.

10
00:00:55,847 --> 00:00:58,558
This is actually
my favorite time of year to be here.

11
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,768
After Labor Day,

12
00:00:59,851 --> 00:01:02,854
when all the rank and file
have returned to Back Bay

13
00:01:02,937 --> 00:01:06,066
and the Upper East Side,
and it's just me and the beasts

14
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,859
and the sea creatures

15
00:01:08,735 --> 00:01:10,111
reclaiming the island.

16
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,782
Why do you want to be my assistant?

17
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,159
[hesitating]

18
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:17,911
Honestly, you.

19
00:01:17,994 --> 00:01:19,037
I googled you,

20
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:21,873
um, and I watched a YouTube video of you

21
00:01:21,956 --> 00:01:26,211
speaking about conservation
and preservation, and…

22
00:01:28,004 --> 00:01:29,464
you were electric.

23
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,885
Something told me
that I needed to come work for you.

24
00:01:37,764 --> 00:01:39,974
You're currently based in New York?

25
00:01:40,058 --> 00:01:40,892
Yes.

26
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:44,521
-Where, Manhattan?
-Uh, no, uh, Queens.

27
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:47,273
An area I like to call
airport-adjacent. [laughs]

28
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:48,858
You work where?

29
00:01:48,942 --> 00:01:50,568
Uh, I tutor full-time at Kaplan.

30
00:01:50,652 --> 00:01:53,947
[inhales deeply] I temp on weekends
at a telemarketing company,

31
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:56,783
and I work at Starbucks
for the health insurance.

32
00:01:56,866 --> 00:01:58,576
Mmm, humble pie, huh?

33
00:01:58,660 --> 00:02:01,412
Yeah, well, beats going home broke
on a Peter Pan bus.

34
00:02:01,496 --> 00:02:03,289
That's my drop-dead. [chuckles]

35
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:04,916
-Where's home?
-Buffalo.

36
00:02:04,999 --> 00:02:06,042
Oof!

37
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,502
Just say "upstate," honey.

38
00:02:08,628 --> 00:02:12,465
I'm from an armpit called Fresno,
but I tell everyone Bay Area.

39
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,591
[Michaela chuckles]

40
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:18,847
So, you did one year
of law school at City College.

41
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:20,140
Why just one year?

42
00:02:21,182 --> 00:02:23,601
You're a lawyer. Um, I read your bio.

43
00:02:23,685 --> 00:02:26,354
I don't need to tell you
how difficult law school is.

44
00:02:26,437 --> 00:02:27,272
[Michaela] Mm-hmm.

45
00:02:27,355 --> 00:02:30,191
But you got the Goldberg Scholarship
to Yale undergrad.

46
00:02:30,275 --> 00:02:31,401
That's a full ride

47
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:34,362
for exceptionally gifted students
below the poverty line.

48
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,990
I'm surprised that you know that.

49
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:39,450
I got the same scholarship.

50
00:02:42,287 --> 00:02:44,706
So, tell me why
you really left law school.

51
00:02:48,626 --> 00:02:49,794
I hated it.

52
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,965
I think I… I think I felt like I had to go

53
00:02:54,841 --> 00:03:00,054
because I had been saying
that I was pre-law since the second grade,

54
00:03:00,138 --> 00:03:02,974
but, um, I only said that because my mom

55
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:06,561
called me a future lawyer one time
and, um…

56
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:09,731
she died young.

57
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:12,984
So, it just…
it became this idea I clung to.

58
00:03:13,067 --> 00:03:13,902
[smacks lips]

59
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:15,862
Yeah. And then I got there,

60
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,239
and it wasn't for me, so… so I quit.

61
00:03:20,116 --> 00:03:21,993
If it doesn't serve you, let it go.

62
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:24,787
I really like that.

63
00:03:25,997 --> 00:03:27,457
My mom died young too.

64
00:03:28,082 --> 00:03:30,210
Breast cancer. I was nine.

65
00:03:32,378 --> 00:03:35,757
Mine was in a car accident.
A… A drunk driver hit her.

66
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,966
I was seven.

67
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:38,468
I'm so sorry.

68
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,140
Let me look at you.

69
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:48,603
[chuckles]

70
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,520
Okay.

71
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:51,105
[mystical music playing]

72
00:04:00,531 --> 00:04:01,616
Come with me.

73
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:07,413
[chirping]

74
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:09,123
[Michaela] This is Barnaby.

75
00:04:10,041 --> 00:04:12,293
We found him half-drowned in the surf.

76
00:04:12,794 --> 00:04:14,420
Hi, Barnaby.

77
00:04:14,504 --> 00:04:16,756
-[screeching]
-Hey, good boy.

78
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,258
Good boy.

79
00:04:18,883 --> 00:04:21,386
Yeah, he's very frail.

80
00:04:21,469 --> 00:04:23,638
We hand-feed him every day.

81
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:25,473
This is what you'll be doing

82
00:04:26,891 --> 00:04:28,309
if you accept the position.

83
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,938
You're offering me the job?

84
00:04:32,021 --> 00:04:34,732
I am.
I think you should start immediately.

85
00:04:34,816 --> 00:04:37,694
[mystical music playing]

86
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:39,195
[Ethan] What do you say?

87
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:42,532
[dramatic music playing]

88
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:47,787
[music stops]

89
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,539
Did you hear me, Simone?

90
00:04:49,622 --> 00:04:51,040
[softly] My dad is here.

91
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:53,418
Why is my dad here?

92
00:04:53,501 --> 00:04:54,627
Uh…

93
00:04:54,711 --> 00:04:57,130
Could we talk about this
when I'm not on bended knee?

94
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:59,924
-Why would you do this to me, Ethan?
-What-- Like, the ring?

95
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:01,634
-It was my mom's ring.
-No. No. My dad.

96
00:05:01,718 --> 00:05:03,261
Why would you bring my dad here?

97
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:05,722
[Ethan] I… I… I was being romantic.

98
00:05:05,805 --> 00:05:08,725
You know, like, grand gesture-type thing.

99
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:13,146
Um, look, Michaela said
some really cruel things to me

100
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:14,397
yesterday on the cliff.

101
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:16,232
Well, she called me a selfish man-baby.

102
00:05:16,316 --> 00:05:19,736
And she said that I had
no business jerking you around.

103
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:23,072
And I suddenly realized she's right.

104
00:05:23,156 --> 00:05:25,366
-I am a selfish man-baby.
-Whoa. Hey. Hey, hey.

105
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,161
Let's sit on the couch.
Just take a seat on the couch.

106
00:05:28,244 --> 00:05:29,579
Sorry. He just needs to sit down.

107
00:05:29,662 --> 00:05:31,789
-Just right here. Hey, Ethan.
-I realize I don't--

108
00:05:31,873 --> 00:05:34,208
-I don't want--
-Did you happen to bring his meds?

109
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:36,586
-His nurse packed them.
-I'm not his nurse. They're in his bag.

110
00:05:36,669 --> 00:05:38,004
-Where?
-[Bruce] I have my pills.

111
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:40,131
-In the ziplock. In the inside…
-Okay, all right.

112
00:05:40,214 --> 00:05:43,343
Sorry about that.
Continue, uh, selfish man-baby.

113
00:05:43,426 --> 00:05:45,386
Thank you. Um, okay.

114
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,308
Well, what I'm trying to say is that
I've been lost at sea for a long time.

115
00:05:50,391 --> 00:05:51,934
Now here you are.

116
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,730
You're the girl of my dreams,
and I want to be worthy of that.

117
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,732
I want to be worthy of you.

118
00:05:57,815 --> 00:06:00,318
I want to commit to you,
and… and I want to do it right.

119
00:06:00,401 --> 00:06:02,904
So, I went to ask Bruce for your hand.

120
00:06:03,488 --> 00:06:06,616
And… then he and his nurse said
they wanted to come back here with me.

121
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,409
I am not his nurse.

122
00:06:08,493 --> 00:06:09,786
I actually came here for D.

123
00:06:09,869 --> 00:06:10,828
Hey, what the fuck?

124
00:06:10,912 --> 00:06:12,914
You can't leave me with him
without an explanation.

125
00:06:12,997 --> 00:06:16,417
-So you schlepped him to a remote island?
-[Ray] What else was I supposed to do?

126
00:06:16,501 --> 00:06:18,419
Also, you look very hot, by the way.

127
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,587
[Ethan] Um…

128
00:06:20,213 --> 00:06:21,464
[sighs]

129
00:06:21,547 --> 00:06:23,674
I'm sorry.
This isn't going the way I planned it.

130
00:06:23,758 --> 00:06:26,302
I just… I thought you'd be happy,
honestly, Simone,

131
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:27,804
to have your dad here for this.

132
00:06:27,887 --> 00:06:31,516
-I love you. I want to marry you.
-[automated voice] Front door open.

133
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,810
What's going on? Who are these people?

134
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,103
-Um…
-[Bruce] Oh my God.

135
00:06:36,104 --> 00:06:37,063
It's you.

136
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:38,689
Is it?

137
00:06:39,273 --> 00:06:40,483
-It is.
-What?

138
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:41,943
[Bruce] It's really you.

139
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:43,903
I knew it.

140
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:47,156
I felt you coming.

141
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:48,783
-Hi.
-Hi.

142
00:06:48,866 --> 00:06:50,493
[Bruce chuckles] You remember me?

143
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,288
[Michaela] Oh, I'm… I'm sure I do.
Would you tell me your name?

144
00:06:54,372 --> 00:06:55,206
Bruce.

145
00:06:55,998 --> 00:06:57,917
Hi, Bruce. I'm Michaela.

146
00:06:58,000 --> 00:06:59,001
I know you.

147
00:06:59,502 --> 00:07:04,090
We've known each other
for a very, very, very, very long time.

148
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,758
-Uh-huh.
-[Bruce exhales]

149
00:07:07,093 --> 00:07:10,012
-[whispering] Can you take…
-[Bruce] You are more beautiful than ever.

150
00:07:10,513 --> 00:07:11,556
[exhales deeply]

151
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:14,684
Oh. [sighs]

152
00:07:14,767 --> 00:07:16,060
We like to fuck, you and me.

153
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:18,020
-Oh my God. Dad! Dad!
-Oh my God.

154
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,314
-Hey, Bruce.
-[Devon] Hey, Dad. Dad.

155
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:21,482
-No, Dad…
-Can you fuck!

156
00:07:21,566 --> 00:07:23,943
-This is Simone's boss, Dad.
-She can fuck.

157
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,194
-You're confused.
-The hell I am.

158
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,530
[Devon] You don't know this woman.
This is a stranger.

159
00:07:27,613 --> 00:07:30,366
-This guy, purple shirt, he's very rich.
-[Michaela] Oh.

160
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,285
-I came in a jet.
-[Michaela] Uh-huh.

161
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,162
He's going to marry our daughter.

162
00:07:34,245 --> 00:07:35,746
-[Michaela] Well…
-[Bruce] Simone.

163
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:39,333
[Michaela] I'm very curious to hear
what Simone is going to say.

164
00:07:39,417 --> 00:07:42,378
So, why don't-- No, no, no, no, no.
Why don't you stay here?

165
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,255
Hold my hand, and we'll listen.

166
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:46,632
-Okay.
-[Michaela] Okay.

167
00:07:49,010 --> 00:07:49,969
Um…

168
00:07:50,678 --> 00:07:51,596
[smacks lips]

169
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,849
-Simone DeWitt, will you marry me?
-[laughs nervously]

170
00:07:54,932 --> 00:07:58,686
My dad just said, "Kiki fucks."
I… I can't… I can't do this.

171
00:07:58,769 --> 00:08:02,148
-No. No, not like this. I can't. I can't.
-Wait. Simone, wait! Wait!

172
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,566
[Michaela] Simone. Simone, wait.

173
00:08:03,649 --> 00:08:05,610
Wait. No. I'm going after her.
She's my girlfriend.

174
00:08:05,693 --> 00:08:07,862
-You've done enough.
-Let me talk to her. She wants me.

175
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:09,572
Don't be ridiculous. You're in last place.

176
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,742
Actually, I agree with that.
It would be one, two, three.

177
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:13,868
-Or maybe two…
-Oh, come on.

178
00:08:13,951 --> 00:08:15,870
You deal with your dad,
you deal with your guests,

179
00:08:15,953 --> 00:08:16,954
and I will go.

180
00:08:17,038 --> 00:08:18,873
Bye, Michaela.

181
00:08:18,956 --> 00:08:20,708
[dramatic music playing]

182
00:08:20,791 --> 00:08:21,709
Bye, Bruce.

183
00:08:23,377 --> 00:08:24,587
[door opens]

184
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,089
-[automated voice] Front door open.
-[door closes]

185
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:30,176
-[Ethan] Mmm…
-Okay. [sighs]

186
00:08:30,259 --> 00:08:33,262
[dramatic music continues]

187
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:41,479
[music ends]

188
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:42,772
[sizzling]

189
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:44,482
[Peter] What do you mean,
there's no bread?

190
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:46,442
Well, leading up to the gala,

191
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:49,111
Mrs. Kell prefers
that there are no carbs on the property.

192
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:51,656
Unless it's for a guest or an event.

193
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:55,076
No carbs on my property?
Has she lost her mind?

194
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,536
[Patrice] Oh, it's fine.

195
00:08:57,036 --> 00:08:59,539
We are… We're grateful to have
the opportunity to be so healthy.

196
00:08:59,622 --> 00:09:02,542
-We drink water.
-Yeah. Sometimes we put mint in it.

197
00:09:02,625 --> 00:09:04,335
Or lemon, if we're feeling bold.

198
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:07,004
Well, we are not eating
my dad's clam chowder

199
00:09:07,088 --> 00:09:09,131
without some warm, crusty bread

200
00:09:09,215 --> 00:09:10,841
and good, salty butter.

201
00:09:10,925 --> 00:09:12,635
Did someone say crusty bread?

202
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,972
Uh, Cupertino's closes
in about five minutes.

203
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,474
Would someone like to make a run?

204
00:09:18,558 --> 00:09:19,809
Me. Pick me.

205
00:09:19,892 --> 00:09:21,018
-[Patrice] Oh, okay.
-I'll go.

206
00:09:21,102 --> 00:09:22,728
[Patrice] Why don't you grab
some petty cash?

207
00:09:23,604 --> 00:09:25,648
Bread! Whoo!

208
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:28,568
Shall I set the dining room table
for you and Mrs. Kell, sir?

209
00:09:28,651 --> 00:09:30,778
-And you guys too. Please join us.
-[phone pinging]

210
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:35,700
-[giggles]
-What's the ping-ping-pinging?

211
00:09:37,159 --> 00:09:38,744
Nothing. Just staff stuff.

212
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:39,996
[phone pinging]

213
00:09:40,788 --> 00:09:43,457
Oh, come on.
I want to hear the kitchen gossip too.

214
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:45,001
Um…

215
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,628
Well,

216
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,716
apparently, Mrs. Kell's assistant
just got proposed to.

217
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:53,759
-Simone?
-[Missy] Yeah.

218
00:09:53,843 --> 00:09:55,428
Mr. Corbin from next door.

219
00:09:56,053 --> 00:09:58,431
Five-carat cushion-cut ring.

220
00:09:58,514 --> 00:09:59,932
-[exclaims] Dang.
-Mmm.

221
00:10:00,558 --> 00:10:03,811
Wow, that's great news
for the happy couple.

222
00:10:03,894 --> 00:10:06,731
Would you like me
to send some champagne to them, sir?

223
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,609
Yeah, I mean, I guess that's what you do.

224
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:11,235
-Right?
-[sizzling]

225
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,945
Oh shit.

226
00:10:13,529 --> 00:10:15,114
I burned the onions. Ow!

227
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,116
Goddamn it.

228
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:19,535
[pot rattling]

229
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:21,621
[dramatic music playing]

230
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:23,039
[sighs]

231
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:28,252
[bird screeching]

232
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,297
[panting]

233
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,221
[music ends]

234
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:40,389
-Hey.
-[Missy] Bride-to-be.

235
00:10:40,473 --> 00:10:41,682
[Patrice] Congratulations.

236
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,226
Yeah. Hey… hey, yeah, we heard the news.

237
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,853
-Wow, that's neat.
-Hmm.

238
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:48,439
-[Simone sniffling]
-[Peter] Oh no.

239
00:10:48,522 --> 00:10:49,774
What's wrong?

240
00:10:49,857 --> 00:10:51,025
Uh… [sighs]

241
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:55,488
Those don't look like tears of joy.

242
00:10:56,322 --> 00:10:57,281
[inhales deeply]

243
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,742
Yeah, it… it was a horror show.

244
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:02,912
Why? Because… you said no?

245
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:07,875
Sorry. Um… [sniffles]

246
00:11:07,958 --> 00:11:10,795
Yeah, I… I really need
to be alone right now, Peter. So…

247
00:11:10,878 --> 00:11:12,588
Wait. Simone.

248
00:11:12,672 --> 00:11:13,673
[inhales deeply]

249
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:17,259
I feel like the biggest asshole
about what happened earlier.

250
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:22,056
You were just trying to be kind to me,
and I… I was way, way out of line.

251
00:11:22,139 --> 00:11:24,558
-I'm re… I'm really sorry.
-It's… It's fine. Let's forget it.

252
00:11:24,642 --> 00:11:28,020
The last thing you need
is some old guy trying to kiss you

253
00:11:28,104 --> 00:11:31,440
on the day when you're getting engaged.

254
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:34,276
Not engaged. Unclear, but…

255
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,653
I won't tell her, Peter.

256
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,323
-Really?
-Yeah, don't worry.

257
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:41,617
I would never ask you for that,

258
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:44,161
because I know
you and Michaela are very close.

259
00:11:44,245 --> 00:11:48,499
I… I have as much to lose as you do, so,
um, yeah, it'll be… it'll be our secret.

260
00:11:48,582 --> 00:11:49,792
Pinky promise.

261
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,127
-Okay, great. Good.
-Mmm.

262
00:11:51,210 --> 00:11:52,837
-Mmm.
-I mean, okay. Pinky…

263
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,716
Pinky promise. And… And, yeah,
I mean, if you're okay with that.

264
00:11:56,799 --> 00:11:58,092
Mm-hmm. Okay.

265
00:11:58,634 --> 00:12:00,970
Uh, again, I… I'm really sorry.

266
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:02,388
-Mm-hmm.
-Really.

267
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:03,889
[phone pings]

268
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,391
[softly] Son of a bitch.

269
00:12:05,474 --> 00:12:07,935
What? I left my phone out there. What?

270
00:12:08,018 --> 00:12:10,980
Jose says Ethan's bringing
everyone over here for dinner.

271
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:12,189
Oh no!

272
00:12:12,273 --> 00:12:16,026
Jose doesn't know what else to do.
All Ethan has in his fridge is Ozempic.

273
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:17,445
This is a fuck show, man.

274
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:18,863
This job is a fuck show.

275
00:12:18,946 --> 00:12:19,822
[breathes shakily]

276
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,073
A fuck show, my--

277
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:22,867
Did you hear that? A fuck show.

278
00:12:23,659 --> 00:12:24,994
My Bell's palsy is back.

279
00:12:25,077 --> 00:12:26,328
Come on. We're clear.

280
00:12:26,412 --> 00:12:27,371
[Patrice sighs]

281
00:12:27,455 --> 00:12:30,458
Every summer.
This happens every summer. Fucking stress.

282
00:12:30,541 --> 00:12:32,668
[whimsical music playing]

283
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,254
All right, uh, everyone buckled?

284
00:12:36,255 --> 00:12:38,424
Just don't scratch the leather, all right?

285
00:12:39,216 --> 00:12:41,135
[car engine starts]

286
00:12:41,218 --> 00:12:42,928
This is a woman's car.

287
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,598
[Ray chuckles]

288
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,099
[Michaela] Simone?

289
00:12:47,183 --> 00:12:48,100
[door closes]

290
00:12:48,726 --> 00:12:49,977
Have you seen Simone?

291
00:12:50,978 --> 00:12:52,062
She's in her room.

292
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:54,815
Also, the photographer
from Vanity Fair is here for you.

293
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:57,193
-Why?
-To approve the proofs from the shoot.

294
00:12:57,276 --> 00:12:58,944
He's been waiting for an hour
in the TV room.

295
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:00,488
Well, can't Peter do it?

296
00:13:00,571 --> 00:13:03,574
He said he specifically needs to show you.
You have final approval.

297
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,451
-[door closes]
-Well, then he'll have to wait.

298
00:13:05,534 --> 00:13:06,452
[Simone] Kiki.

299
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,288
-Hi.
-Oh, honey.

300
00:13:10,331 --> 00:13:13,042
-Can I talk to you? [sighs]
-Yes. It's gonna be okay.

301
00:13:13,125 --> 00:13:13,959
Okay.

302
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,546
-What should I do?
-Mmm…

303
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:20,341
Do you want to be Mrs. Ethan Corbin?

304
00:13:22,885 --> 00:13:23,928
I don't know.

305
00:13:25,012 --> 00:13:28,307
He was a… He was a ten out of ten
in my eyes until now, but…

306
00:13:29,016 --> 00:13:31,352
All right, let me ask you
a better question.

307
00:13:31,977 --> 00:13:32,853
[inhales deeply]

308
00:13:32,937 --> 00:13:34,855
Does this look like fun to you?

309
00:13:34,939 --> 00:13:37,608
Being a Mrs. Somebody?

310
00:13:37,691 --> 00:13:39,902
Uh, your life looks very fun.

311
00:13:39,985 --> 00:13:42,071
Oh, it is. At first.

312
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:46,784
I remember my colleagues were so dazzled
when I became Mrs. Peter Kell.

313
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:51,705
I was always jetting off
to Aspen or Majorca or Lake Como.

314
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:55,459
Everyone expected me to quit my job,
but I was like, "No, no, no, no. No."

315
00:13:55,543 --> 00:13:58,462
"My career is my identity."

316
00:13:58,546 --> 00:13:59,463
[inhales sharply]

317
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:00,923
But it happens.

318
00:14:01,006 --> 00:14:04,760
You're so busy with the new house
and planning dinner parties

319
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:06,720
and trying to get pregnant,
and he keeps saying,

320
00:14:06,804 --> 00:14:09,265
"Michaela, just let me take care of you."

321
00:14:09,348 --> 00:14:11,308
And so, one day, you choose to let him.

322
00:14:12,685 --> 00:14:15,145
You send somebody else
to pack up that office

323
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:17,064
that once meant so much to you.

324
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:17,982
So,

325
00:14:18,941 --> 00:14:22,987
when you're a Mrs. Somebody,
your life gets huge,

326
00:14:25,114 --> 00:14:27,449
but you get very tiny.

327
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:29,952
But… But not you.

328
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:32,496
Your incredible philanthropy
and preservation work.

329
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:35,332
If… If… If Peter were to divorce me,

330
00:14:35,416 --> 00:14:38,961
I'd lose everything. The preserve, aviary.

331
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:41,547
My whole life hinges on his approval.

332
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,506
He loves you.

333
00:14:42,590 --> 00:14:43,632
I work for him.

334
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:47,219
We all do.

335
00:14:47,761 --> 00:14:50,681
This isn't about me, though.
This is about you.

336
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:54,560
You don't have to choose
to be taken care of.

337
00:14:54,643 --> 00:14:57,396
You have a big future in front of you.

338
00:14:57,479 --> 00:14:59,398
No, I don't… I don't know about that.

339
00:14:59,481 --> 00:15:03,569
Mmm, I do. I want you to start
chairing our foundation in New York.

340
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:09,074
-Kiki, no, I--
-What do you think I was training you for?

341
00:15:09,158 --> 00:15:10,826
I was gonna tell you on the plane.

342
00:15:10,910 --> 00:15:12,912
I want you to run our operations.

343
00:15:12,995 --> 00:15:16,373
You'd have an apartment in New York
and triple your salary.

344
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,958
Whatever… Whatever you need.

345
00:15:20,836 --> 00:15:22,504
I don't know what to say. Um…

346
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:23,756
Say yes.

347
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:25,507
-I love you, Kiki.
-[laughs]

348
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,635
-I'm… I'm so lucky to have you in my life.
-Oh.

349
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:28,677
No.

350
00:15:29,470 --> 00:15:30,804
I'm the lucky one.

351
00:15:31,388 --> 00:15:33,974
[dramatic music playing]

352
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,185
[slurping loudly]

353
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,607
[cutlery clinking]

354
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:47,988
What do you guys think
"not like this" means?

355
00:15:48,572 --> 00:15:50,824
Like, when she said, "Not like this,"

356
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:54,036
is that a no or is that, like, logistics?

357
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:57,206
-Well, it wasn't a yes.
-[laughs]

358
00:15:57,706 --> 00:15:58,540
Right.

359
00:15:59,208 --> 00:16:01,710
What did Michaela say
when you asked her to marry you, Pete?

360
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,545
-Yes.
-My wife said yes too.

361
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:04,755
-Mine too.
-Mine too.

362
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,131
-Mine too.
-Mine too.

363
00:16:06,215 --> 00:16:08,842
Wonderful. Thanks, guys. I'm getting
my heart trampled on over here.

364
00:16:08,926 --> 00:16:12,012
Well, it was kind of
an impromptu decision, wasn't it, pal?

365
00:16:12,096 --> 00:16:13,138
No.

366
00:16:13,222 --> 00:16:14,682
No, no, no, no, man.

367
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:17,935
Like, once I saw it, you know,
the kids, the… the chocolate lab,

368
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,020
the Christmas card, I… I knew I wanted it.

369
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:23,691
I mean, how beautiful would mine
and Simone's kids be? [chuckles]

370
00:16:23,774 --> 00:16:24,900
[inhales deeply]

371
00:16:24,984 --> 00:16:26,860
And the sex with this woman, Pete. Mmm!

372
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:28,779
-[Jose] Jesus.
-[Ethan] Best of my life.

373
00:16:28,862 --> 00:16:30,155
-[Patrice] Come on, man.
-[laughs]

374
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,700
I want to go back a second.
Raymond, you said you're married.

375
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,076
So, you're not a couple?

376
00:16:34,159 --> 00:16:37,413
That's between us two and not you.
Three minus you equals shut up.

377
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:38,831
[laughs]

378
00:16:38,914 --> 00:16:42,793
Hey, who's that guy on the end over there?
I don't know that guy.

379
00:16:42,876 --> 00:16:45,087
Oh, that's Eddy. He's on our ground crew.

380
00:16:45,170 --> 00:16:46,005
Hey.

381
00:16:46,714 --> 00:16:47,548
Devon.

382
00:16:49,216 --> 00:16:50,467
[Bruce] I'm confused.

383
00:16:50,551 --> 00:16:52,553
Is Simone gonna marry
the guy with the jet?

384
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:57,057
We don't know yet.
And, uh, yeah, that's my boss, Raymond.

385
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,642
My married boss, Raymond.

386
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,686
Raymond, my boss with a wife.

387
00:17:00,769 --> 00:17:01,729
Oh.

388
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,397
You're fuckboy?

389
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:06,400
-What'd you just call me, bitch?
-Morgan, be polite to the nurse.

390
00:17:06,483 --> 00:17:10,237
I'm not a fucking nurse. I manage
a Falafel Balls with a 4.6 on Yelp.

391
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,365
I'm a Naval captain
with a USCG Master License, the highest.

392
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,450
[Jose] Gentlemen.

393
00:17:14,533 --> 00:17:17,745
Let's concentrate on
Peter's delicious clam chowder, shall we?

394
00:17:18,912 --> 00:17:20,998
[Bruce] Why is there a horse in here?

395
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:22,791
[Devon] Oh, Dad.

396
00:17:23,917 --> 00:17:28,172
Peter says that Ethan is eager to talk
and that he wants to come up.

397
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:30,716
Okay. I feel ready. Send him up.

398
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:34,261
Uh, can we do 30 seconds of admin first
before you dump him?

399
00:17:34,344 --> 00:17:35,471
-Of course. Yeah.
-Sorry.

400
00:17:35,554 --> 00:17:37,639
So, while you were spying on Peter,

401
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:40,434
I was trying to get into his email
because Phil said I should get proof

402
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,228
he's having an affair,
but I am locked out.

403
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:45,898
Jose is such a snake.

404
00:17:45,981 --> 00:17:48,734
Do you have any idea
what he'd change his passwords to?

405
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,527
Um… [exhales]

406
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:52,196
Did you try every device?

407
00:17:52,279 --> 00:17:54,448
Usually doesn't password-protect
his personal phone.

408
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,407
Pro tip.

409
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:56,950
Okay.

410
00:17:57,034 --> 00:17:58,160
Knock him dead, baby.

411
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,453
For what it's worth,

412
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,623
I don't think he's having an affair, Kiki.

413
00:18:03,290 --> 00:18:04,374
Hey hey.

414
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:07,252
[pensive music playing]

415
00:18:08,295 --> 00:18:10,631
[breathes deeply]

416
00:18:10,714 --> 00:18:11,840
[door opens]

417
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,218
[door closes]

418
00:18:14,301 --> 00:18:16,303
[pensive music continues]

419
00:18:19,389 --> 00:18:20,265
[Michaela] Ethan,

420
00:18:20,766 --> 00:18:23,602
Simone would like to see you
upstairs at this time.

421
00:18:23,685 --> 00:18:26,480
-Ooh, sounds ominous, bro.
-What? Is she taking numbers?

422
00:18:26,563 --> 00:18:27,648
Can I be next in line?

423
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:29,900
Hey, uh, wish me luck.

424
00:18:29,983 --> 00:18:31,944
I'd take something harder than wine,
my friend.

425
00:18:32,027 --> 00:18:34,363
-Good luck, Ethan. We're rooting for you.
-[Ray] Yeah.

426
00:18:34,446 --> 00:18:35,572
-Good luck.
-Vaya con Dios.

427
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:37,449
-[Ray] You got it.
-All right, thank you.

428
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,619
Hey, beauty.

429
00:18:40,702 --> 00:18:41,829
Hi, Bruce.

430
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,706
-How are you doing?
-Better now that you're here.

431
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:46,291
[Michaela] What am I interrupting?

432
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,336
I was just inviting Bruce
and Raymond to the gala.

433
00:18:49,419 --> 00:18:51,588
Oh. How lovely.

434
00:18:52,256 --> 00:18:55,259
Mmm, but, sadly, because someone

435
00:18:55,342 --> 00:18:58,220
traveled my infirm father here,
we all have to leave.

436
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,722
Yeah, I gotta work anyways.
Place can't run without me.

437
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:03,100
Devon, are they Buffalo Bills fans
like you?

438
00:19:03,183 --> 00:19:04,935
-Yeah.
-[Jose] Oh.

439
00:19:05,018 --> 00:19:07,020
-Jim Kelly's gonna be here.
-I'm sorry, what?

440
00:19:07,104 --> 00:19:09,356
-Jim Kelly?
-The Jim Kelly?

441
00:19:09,439 --> 00:19:11,567
-[Morgan] Who's Jim Kelly?
-Oh my God.

442
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:13,527
[Ray] He's the greatest quarterback
in Bills history.

443
00:19:13,610 --> 00:19:16,071
[Bruce] Took us to the Super Bowl
four times, son.

444
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:17,573
Ever hear of the K-Gun offense?

445
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:18,991
Jim Kelly comes to your gala?

446
00:19:19,074 --> 00:19:20,826
[Peter] He's got a place
on Martha's Vineyard.

447
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:24,121
He pops over once a year.
One year he brought Doug Flutie.

448
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:26,415
[gasps] I can't breathe.
You know how I feel about Dougie.

449
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:27,332
-[Ray laughs]
-Yeah.

450
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:31,587
I accept your invite to the gala.
If you two need to go, you can go.

451
00:19:31,670 --> 00:19:33,755
No, because if he's gonna stay,
then I have to…

452
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:36,008
Work's canceled.
I'll just burn the restaurant down.

453
00:19:36,091 --> 00:19:38,218
Okay. I'll get my tux guy
over here in the morning

454
00:19:38,302 --> 00:19:39,803
and get you gentlemen all tuxed up.

455
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:40,888
[yells excitedly]

456
00:19:40,971 --> 00:19:41,972
[Michaela] Wonderful.

457
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:45,475
Patrice, do let catering know ASAP.

458
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,060
[Patrice] Yes, Mrs. Kell. I will.

459
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:48,979
[exhales]

460
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:50,856
[Ray mumbling]

461
00:19:51,607 --> 00:19:52,608
Is that bread?

462
00:19:54,067 --> 00:19:54,985
[Jose] Mm-mm.

463
00:19:56,111 --> 00:19:57,362
-[Patrice clears throat]
-Yeah.

464
00:20:01,033 --> 00:20:04,036
[suspenseful music playing]

465
00:20:25,766 --> 00:20:26,600
[door closes]

466
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:28,560
[phone clicks]

467
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,115
[line ringing]

468
00:20:49,581 --> 00:20:50,666
[man on phone] Hi, Dad.

469
00:20:51,959 --> 00:20:52,793
Hello?

470
00:20:53,335 --> 00:20:54,169
[phone beeps]

471
00:20:54,753 --> 00:20:55,712
[Jose] Go! Bread!

472
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:56,713
[speaks Spanish]

473
00:20:56,797 --> 00:20:59,883
Wait. As I recall, he lost
each and every one of those Super Bowls.

474
00:20:59,967 --> 00:21:02,052
When was the last time
the Dolphins won the Super Bowl?

475
00:21:02,135 --> 00:21:03,053
-The last--
-Period.

476
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:03,971
Okay, whatever.

477
00:21:04,054 --> 00:21:06,390
-Before you were born, missy. Okay?
-[all laugh]

478
00:21:06,473 --> 00:21:08,558
I'm gonna go check
on the gala crew at the bar

479
00:21:08,642 --> 00:21:10,644
and make sure
we're buttoned up for tomorrow, okay?

480
00:21:10,727 --> 00:21:12,479
-[Devon] Bye, Jose.
-Buenas noches.

481
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,147
-Thank you, Jose.
-Of course.

482
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:15,816
[Peter inhales deeply]

483
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:17,943
Bruce,

484
00:21:18,026 --> 00:21:20,946
would you care
to retire to my office with me

485
00:21:21,029 --> 00:21:23,740
and drink some scotch
and talk about old guy shit?

486
00:21:23,824 --> 00:21:25,659
[scoffs] Pope wear a funny hat?

487
00:21:25,742 --> 00:21:26,994
[laughing]

488
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:28,370
Right this way.

489
00:21:28,870 --> 00:21:30,205
[Devon] Not too much scotch.

490
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:31,498
[Bruce grunts]

491
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:33,375
-Don't forget your bag.
-[Bruce] All right.

492
00:21:34,751 --> 00:21:36,878
Hey, you own this whole house?

493
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:39,423
It's been in my family for generations.

494
00:21:39,506 --> 00:21:40,590
Wow.

495
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:43,385
What size water heater
do you need for a place like this?

496
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,678
[Peter] I have no idea.

497
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:46,388
[door closes]

498
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:52,019
Damn, how long does it take
to dump somebody?

499
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,396
[sighs]

500
00:22:00,652 --> 00:22:01,737
[dramatic music playing]

501
00:22:01,820 --> 00:22:03,238
[sighs deeply]

502
00:22:05,198 --> 00:22:07,200
[chairs scraping]

503
00:22:24,217 --> 00:22:25,260
[exhales nervously]

504
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:27,763
[crickets chirping]

505
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:30,098
[Patrice] It's okay.
I don't need help clearing the table.

506
00:22:30,182 --> 00:22:31,391
Happy Labor Day.

507
00:22:31,475 --> 00:22:34,561
Right. Oh, that's right.
My very favorite holiday. Here we go.

508
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:36,355
[slurping]

509
00:22:36,438 --> 00:22:39,483
Does it… Does it mean nothing to you
that I… that I flew your dad in?

510
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:40,400
It… [sighs]

511
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:44,154
It means that you don't listen.
It means you profoundly misunderstand me.

512
00:22:44,237 --> 00:22:46,323
How was I supposed to know
you don't like your dad?

513
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,324
I love my dad.

514
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:50,535
Maybe when I told you that we don't speak,
that might've been a clue.

515
00:22:50,619 --> 00:22:53,121
I thought it would be good for you
to see him, mend fences.

516
00:22:53,205 --> 00:22:54,748
Those fences belong to me.

517
00:22:54,831 --> 00:22:57,501
Jesus, Simone.
I don't even know who you are right now.

518
00:22:57,584 --> 00:23:00,712
You're, like, dark.
It's… It's making me very uncomfortable.

519
00:23:00,796 --> 00:23:04,007
Yes, Ethan, exactly.
You don't know who I am right now.

520
00:23:04,091 --> 00:23:05,342
'Cause you don't know me at all.

521
00:23:05,425 --> 00:23:07,302
But that's what…
that's what engagement is for.

522
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,595
-What?
-You get to know each other.

523
00:23:08,678 --> 00:23:11,390
You tell me all the things,
and I tell you all the things

524
00:23:11,473 --> 00:23:12,724
because we love each other.

525
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:13,892
You don't love me.

526
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:15,685
I do love you.

527
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:19,231
I told my mom and dad about you.
I've never done that with anybody before.

528
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,567
They think they're meeting my fiancée
at the gala tomorrow.

529
00:23:22,651 --> 00:23:25,237
Well, that was really premature.

530
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:27,823
[scoffs]

531
00:23:33,412 --> 00:23:34,329
Is there somebody else?

532
00:23:34,413 --> 00:23:36,206
-What? No.
-Are you seeing somebody else?

533
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:37,124
No.

534
00:23:37,207 --> 00:23:40,627
Okay, well, then I don't see
what else could have changed this much

535
00:23:40,710 --> 00:23:41,670
since yesterday.

536
00:23:41,753 --> 00:23:44,631
Okay. Yesterday, you found out
that I was a poor kid from Buffalo,

537
00:23:44,714 --> 00:23:46,049
and you got more interested in me,

538
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:50,220
so you… you could be this white knight
galloping in to rescue me.

539
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:53,056
That is so insulting. And wrong.

540
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,141
It turned you on.

541
00:23:54,808 --> 00:23:55,642
No.

542
00:23:56,351 --> 00:23:59,521
It made me want to…
It made me want to take care of you more.

543
00:23:59,604 --> 00:24:01,189
-Okay.
-It… It made me…

544
00:24:01,982 --> 00:24:02,983
love you more.

545
00:24:03,066 --> 00:24:07,195
Also, yesterday,
I hadn't seen my father in, like,

546
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:09,948
God… [sighs]

547
00:24:10,031 --> 00:24:10,991
…a decade.

548
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:13,326
Not since we faced each other in court,

549
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:18,498
and he lost custody of me due to
criminal negligence and child abuse.

550
00:24:20,667 --> 00:24:21,960
[hesitating]

551
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:24,921
[sighs]

552
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:27,507
[clicks tongue, groans]

553
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:30,135
[sighs deeply]

554
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:32,512
Well, I didn't know that.

555
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:33,763
Yes, you did.

556
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,724
Yes, you did, Ethan.

557
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:38,393
You did. Devon said, "Foster care."

558
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:42,272
I said, "Please, don't make me
talk about something so painful,"

559
00:24:42,856 --> 00:24:45,650
and you said, "Let's put a ring on it."

560
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:46,735
[scoffs]

561
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:48,945
Wow.

562
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:50,947
Wow.

563
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:53,700
[sobbing]

564
00:24:57,662 --> 00:24:59,372
You think my boss
is getting dumped up there?

565
00:24:59,456 --> 00:25:00,832
-[Ray scoffs] For sure.
-For sure.

566
00:25:00,916 --> 00:25:04,085
He was already toast.
Simone eats men up and spits them out.

567
00:25:04,169 --> 00:25:05,879
Hey, don't talk about her like that.

568
00:25:05,962 --> 00:25:08,465
Come on, you remember Ellis,
Drew's little brother?

569
00:25:08,548 --> 00:25:09,966
Dumped this dude on his birthday.

570
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:13,261
He got a bunch of face tattoos
and OD'd at a Wendy's.

571
00:25:13,345 --> 00:25:15,639
That wasn't Simone's fault.
He was an addict.

572
00:25:15,722 --> 00:25:17,682
No, but then she fucked
that married professor.

573
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:19,017
Ruined that guy's life too.

574
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:20,936
[Devon] Oh, yeah.

575
00:25:21,019 --> 00:25:23,188
-That wasn't her best moment.
-[footsteps approaching]

576
00:25:24,356 --> 00:25:27,108
-Can I help you, little man?
-Yeah, I just want to talk to Devon.

577
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:30,987
-What for?
-I… I just thought she might…

578
00:25:31,571 --> 00:25:33,782
Might what? The fuck out of here, man.

579
00:25:33,865 --> 00:25:34,699
Yeah.

580
00:25:36,076 --> 00:25:37,786
[footsteps receding]

581
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:41,081
[whimsical music playing]

582
00:25:41,665 --> 00:25:43,375
Come on! Him too?

583
00:25:45,627 --> 00:25:48,004
Simone, do you realize how many times

584
00:25:48,088 --> 00:25:52,384
I have been voted Most Eligible Bachelor
in New England by N Magazine?

585
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,553
Thrice.

586
00:25:55,845 --> 00:25:57,639
I am a member of Sankaty Golf Club.

587
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:00,141
That's harder to get into
than the US Senate.

588
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,977
I turned down Katy Perry.

589
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:04,187
Well, maybe she's still interested.

590
00:26:04,271 --> 00:26:07,190
Oh, you think this is funny?
Really? Seriously?

591
00:26:07,274 --> 00:26:10,193
You're torturing me
instead of giving me an answer?

592
00:26:10,277 --> 00:26:11,194
Answer to what?

593
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,905
Are you marrying me? Yes or no?

594
00:26:15,031 --> 00:26:15,865
No.

595
00:26:17,284 --> 00:26:19,578
Maybe I've been saying it too nicely,
but no.

596
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,912
-Wait, or--
-Deadass.

597
00:26:20,996 --> 00:26:22,455
-Hold on a second. Or…
-No.

598
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:24,082
Or… Or… [exhales sharply]

599
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:25,875
Okay, we… [sighs]

600
00:26:25,959 --> 00:26:27,210
…we stay together

601
00:26:27,294 --> 00:26:30,547
and work through this pickle
that we're in right now…

602
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:31,464
No.

603
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:35,468
…until we get to a place
where we're both feeling like…

604
00:26:35,552 --> 00:26:36,761
-No. Ethan…
-…let's get engaged.

605
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,389
I am going to New York
with Kiki on Tuesday.

606
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,641
But where does that leave us?

607
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,604
[Morgan] What about you, Devon?

608
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:47,981
-What are you like at home?
-[Ray] She's dope.

609
00:26:48,064 --> 00:26:49,816
-I'm deeply, deeply depressed.
-[Ray] No.

610
00:26:49,899 --> 00:26:52,193
She was prom queen,
captain of the track team.

611
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:53,445
She's being modest.

612
00:26:53,528 --> 00:26:56,031
-Ray, that was 15 years ago.
-This is why she keeps me around.

613
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,949
So I can remind her who she really is

614
00:26:58,033 --> 00:27:00,952
because she ended up getting so serious
after the shit happened.

615
00:27:01,036 --> 00:27:01,995
-What shit?
-Nothing.

616
00:27:02,078 --> 00:27:03,872
Devon had to take care of Simone.

617
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,583
This girl right here
worked full time at Costco.

618
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,878
Nineteen years old. Paying for food,
paying for an apartment for 'em,

619
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:12,839
driving her around, tutoring her,
getting her on the damn honor roll.

620
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,008
That's why I make it my personal mission

621
00:27:15,091 --> 00:27:16,760
to make sure
she's got some joy in her life.

622
00:27:16,843 --> 00:27:17,927
Some drinks in my life.

623
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:20,263
-Sounds to me like you need a break.
-[exhales deeply]

624
00:27:20,347 --> 00:27:23,683
Have you given any more thought
to sailing down to Palm Beach with me?

625
00:27:23,767 --> 00:27:24,726
Wha…

626
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:26,686
[footsteps approaching]

627
00:27:29,814 --> 00:27:31,858
[Ethan sighs] Unbelievable. Fuck!

628
00:27:32,359 --> 00:27:33,568
-[door opens]
-[Devon scoffs]

629
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,611
[door closes]

630
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,529
Hey.

631
00:27:36,613 --> 00:27:38,073
Yikes. You okay?

632
00:27:38,156 --> 00:27:38,990
Yeah.

633
00:27:39,574 --> 00:27:40,575
Um…

634
00:27:40,659 --> 00:27:41,618
Where's Bruce?

635
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,286
He's up there with Peter.

636
00:27:43,370 --> 00:27:45,705
Okay, uh, we need to talk.
Let's go in here.

637
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:48,166
Stay.

638
00:27:53,046 --> 00:27:54,297
[Simone exhales]

639
00:27:55,215 --> 00:27:56,132
-God.
-[door closes]

640
00:27:56,216 --> 00:27:58,009
-Uh, Zeus, lights.
-[Zeus chimes]

641
00:27:58,093 --> 00:27:58,927
[Devon yelps]

642
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:00,804
-Oh my God!
-[man] Sorry.

643
00:28:00,887 --> 00:28:02,305
I couldn't find the lights.

644
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,516
Cyrus, remember?

645
00:28:04,599 --> 00:28:07,394
-The photographer from Vanity Fair.
-Yeah, I remember you.

646
00:28:07,477 --> 00:28:09,145
What are you doing in here?

647
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,857
Waiting on Michaela. I have proofs
to show her from the shoot.

648
00:28:12,941 --> 00:28:15,944
-Oh, she's slammed. Here, I can…
-No, I'll wait.

649
00:28:16,027 --> 00:28:18,196
-[Simone] Okay.
-She needs to see them.

650
00:28:18,279 --> 00:28:20,073
Can you remind her I'm here?

651
00:28:20,156 --> 00:28:20,990
Yeah.

652
00:28:21,074 --> 00:28:22,117
[suspenseful music playing]

653
00:28:22,200 --> 00:28:23,326
[door opens, closes]

654
00:28:24,869 --> 00:28:25,704
[Simone] Okay.

655
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:28,498
[exhales, sighs]

656
00:28:29,624 --> 00:28:30,500
[exhales]

657
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,043
[Simone] Okay, so…

658
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,337
What's the plan?

659
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:37,382
What's the plan for what plan?

660
00:28:37,465 --> 00:28:39,134
I need you to get Bruce out of here.

661
00:28:39,217 --> 00:28:40,093
[scoffs]

662
00:28:40,176 --> 00:28:42,846
I don't know why you're saying this
like it's my fault.

663
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:44,472
Your idiot boyfriend got him here,

664
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:46,725
and your idiot boss
just invited him to the gala.

665
00:28:46,808 --> 00:28:50,520
No way. He… He cannot come to the gala.
He tried to feel Kiki up before.

666
00:28:50,603 --> 00:28:51,438
Well,

667
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:54,941
now you know
what I've been dealing with by myself.

668
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:57,152
He's… He's, like, shockingly bad.

669
00:28:57,819 --> 00:29:01,448
Is he really shockingly bad?
I've been telling you about it all year.

670
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:04,367
Okay.

671
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,953
I can get you
on the first flight out tomorrow,

672
00:29:07,036 --> 00:29:09,414
and you can take him
to the guest house until then

673
00:29:09,497 --> 00:29:10,957
so I never have to see him again.

674
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,375
You're not gonna talk to him?

675
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:14,377
No.

676
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,295
No?

677
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:17,839
No.

678
00:29:18,590 --> 00:29:21,259
The man hasn't left the block since COVID.

679
00:29:21,342 --> 00:29:24,888
He got on a plane
and wore a suit to come see you.

680
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:27,348
How about… I don't care.

681
00:29:27,432 --> 00:29:28,808
Leave him on the rocks.

682
00:29:28,892 --> 00:29:33,480
So you just… you don't feel
any responsibility for him?

683
00:29:33,563 --> 00:29:37,317
He didn't feel any responsibility for me
when I was a kid.

684
00:29:37,817 --> 00:29:40,153
When I went to school hungry and dirty?

685
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,071
No, fuck him.

686
00:29:43,364 --> 00:29:44,240
Fuck him?

687
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:45,784
Wow.

688
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:46,826
That's cold.

689
00:29:48,953 --> 00:29:51,289
Do you know what happens
to girls in foster care?

690
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,335
You know that I do.

691
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,129
He let strangers raise me.

692
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,466
He let strangers abuse me.

693
00:30:02,842 --> 00:30:03,927
He did that.

694
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:06,221
He wasn't right after Mom died.

695
00:30:06,304 --> 00:30:09,808
Everyone thinks that
I wasn't old enough to remember,

696
00:30:10,433 --> 00:30:12,644
but I remember clearly.

697
00:30:12,727 --> 00:30:15,939
The more depressed she got,
the more he ignored her.

698
00:30:16,022 --> 00:30:20,068
When she got manic, he'd go to the bar

699
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:22,320
and leave her for us to handle.

700
00:30:25,448 --> 00:30:27,367
He's the reason she killed herself.

701
00:30:29,285 --> 00:30:30,954
He's the reason that…

702
00:30:33,414 --> 00:30:35,792
He's the reason
that I tried to kill myself.

703
00:30:35,875 --> 00:30:38,461
[breathes deeply]

704
00:30:38,545 --> 00:30:41,047
And he'll be the reason
that you kill yourself.

705
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:45,552
And with all this destructive shit
that you do, Devon,

706
00:30:46,386 --> 00:30:48,179
it seems like you want him to.

707
00:30:48,263 --> 00:30:49,264
[scoffs]

708
00:30:50,515 --> 00:30:51,808
[chuckles sadly]

709
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,606
You know what you sound like?
A crazy bitch who's off her meds.

710
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,067
Oh my God.
It's always about meds with you.

711
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:02,652
Meds, meds, meds. Like, why?

712
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:05,071
I went through your cabinet
and know you're not taking them.

713
00:31:05,154 --> 00:31:06,865
No, I don't take them. You know why?

714
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,701
I don't need them anymore.
My doctor titrated me off of them.

715
00:31:09,784 --> 00:31:12,954
-Whose doctor? Kiki's?
-No. Dr. Fine.

716
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,708
My psychiatrist since, like, 2015.

717
00:31:16,791 --> 00:31:19,377
You can recover from PTSD, you know.

718
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:21,170
You can create the right tools,

719
00:31:21,254 --> 00:31:24,424
find your people,
create a safe space for yourself.

720
00:31:24,507 --> 00:31:27,051
And I'm not your safe space
anymore, right?

721
00:31:27,135 --> 00:31:28,136
Is that right?

722
00:31:28,928 --> 00:31:31,764
Because you are
literally only alive because of me.

723
00:31:33,224 --> 00:31:35,018
I'm alive in spite of you.

724
00:31:35,101 --> 00:31:38,062
You want me to be a toddler
with a broken wing.

725
00:31:38,771 --> 00:31:40,356
-So you have a purpose.
-[gasps]

726
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,775
-So you can blame your shitty life on me.
-That's bullshit.

727
00:31:42,859 --> 00:31:44,652
I didn't even want to tell you

728
00:31:45,486 --> 00:31:46,905
that I went off them,

729
00:31:46,988 --> 00:31:49,115
because I knew it would upset you.

730
00:31:49,198 --> 00:31:51,451
Do you have any idea how that feels?

731
00:31:51,993 --> 00:31:54,454
To know that you don't
actually want me to be well.

732
00:31:59,542 --> 00:32:03,046
I have spent my entire life

733
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:06,257
taking care of you.

734
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,092
You don't want my help anymore?

735
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:11,054
Good fucking luck.

736
00:32:11,137 --> 00:32:14,140
[dramatic music building]

737
00:32:15,099 --> 00:32:16,017
[door slams]

738
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:18,102
[dramatic music playing]

739
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,526
[indistinct conversation]

740
00:32:27,111 --> 00:32:28,196
Don't follow me.

741
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,409
[door opens]

742
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,119
[door closes]

743
00:32:42,210 --> 00:32:43,962
[Bruce] Pretty sweet up here.

744
00:32:44,045 --> 00:32:45,630
-[bottle thuds on table]
-[glasses clink]

745
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:47,840
Bird's-eye view for the king.

746
00:32:48,841 --> 00:32:49,676
Thanks.

747
00:32:49,759 --> 00:32:51,010
[exhales]

748
00:32:51,094 --> 00:32:51,970
[Bruce] So, did…

749
00:32:52,053 --> 00:32:55,390
[grunts] …you earn your money,
or were you born with it?

750
00:32:56,224 --> 00:32:58,059
-A little of both.
-Mmm.

751
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:01,104
Making money is easy
once you've got money.

752
00:33:01,187 --> 00:33:03,147
The easiest thing is to spend it.

753
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,816
-Hmm.
-[lighter clicks]

754
00:33:06,025 --> 00:33:08,444
I was never good at making money

755
00:33:09,529 --> 00:33:10,863
or anything else.

756
00:33:11,698 --> 00:33:14,701
But I do bowl a 220, so there's that.

757
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,913
I think there are things other than money
that make a man feel satisfied.

758
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,415
Oh yeah? Like what?

759
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,334
Kids. Accomplishments.

760
00:33:24,585 --> 00:33:25,545
I'll take the cash.

761
00:33:27,422 --> 00:33:29,716
But you can't take it with you, though.

762
00:33:29,799 --> 00:33:33,720
You can't bring all your riches
and accomplishments with you.

763
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,305
That's the one place
you and me are equals.

764
00:33:37,765 --> 00:33:39,392
Gotta face death alone.

765
00:33:41,102 --> 00:33:44,022
I've built companies
that employ thousands.

766
00:33:44,105 --> 00:33:45,815
I have funded their lives.

767
00:33:45,898 --> 00:33:49,277
I give more to charity in a month

768
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:52,113
than most people will earn
in their lifetime.

769
00:33:54,532 --> 00:33:57,118
None of that matters when my time comes?

770
00:33:57,201 --> 00:34:01,539
Maybe to the people you leave behind,
but you'll be too dead to give a shit.

771
00:34:02,123 --> 00:34:04,667
What about family?
That matters, doesn't it?

772
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,920
If you can remember them.

773
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:09,797
Mmm.

774
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:13,676
But when I die, I just want to be present.

775
00:34:15,636 --> 00:34:17,180
Have my memory

776
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:19,390
and remember.

777
00:34:23,436 --> 00:34:27,482
And… what do you want to remember, Bruce,

778
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:29,525
in those final moments?

779
00:34:29,609 --> 00:34:30,943
My girls.

780
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,571
Devon and Simone.

781
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:34,906
[Peter] Yeah.

782
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:36,324
Yeah.

783
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:37,325
[inhales deeply]

784
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,327
Rory and Sarah for me.

785
00:34:39,410 --> 00:34:41,704
And their mother, Andrea.

786
00:34:43,331 --> 00:34:44,290
[exhales]

787
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:46,626
God, she was beautiful.

788
00:34:50,129 --> 00:34:51,756
I'm still in love with her.

789
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,425
She ruined me, though.

790
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,594
Shipwrecked me.

791
00:34:57,136 --> 00:34:58,721
Made me lose my kids.

792
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:02,058
Yeah, I know how that can happen.

793
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:06,854
Let me have some of that.

794
00:35:07,438 --> 00:35:09,148
I haven't had that since the Navy.

795
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,027
Okay, but just… a small hit

796
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:16,364
because this legal stuff is pretty strong.

797
00:35:17,031 --> 00:35:18,032
[inhales deeply]

798
00:35:18,533 --> 00:35:21,619
[lively music playing]

799
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:25,248
Go away!

800
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:28,543
-She said go away! She means you!
-No, she's talking about you, Popeye.

801
00:35:29,836 --> 00:35:31,921
-Hey, you need help getting up?
-[exhales] No!

802
00:35:32,004 --> 00:35:33,714
Stop. I just want to be alone.

803
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,050
Okay, well, I brought you a flask.

804
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:39,387
I brought you my sweatshirt.
It's warm from my body heat.

805
00:35:39,470 --> 00:35:42,265
-"It's warm from my body heat." Dork!
-Okay, calm down, nurse.

806
00:35:42,348 --> 00:35:44,475
-Here. Ladies first.
-No, thank you, Ray.

807
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:47,562
-Don't worry, it's not Captain Morgan.
-I said no. I don't drink anymore.

808
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:48,604
Since when?

809
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:52,024
Since all year. Since I got my first DUI.

810
00:35:52,108 --> 00:35:56,028
I've told you, like, 40 times I'm trying
to be sober. You never listen to me.

811
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,406
Are these guys bothering you, Devon?

812
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:00,408
[Devon] Oh, Jesus Christ.

813
00:36:00,491 --> 00:36:03,035
-What is wrong with you guys?
-[Ray] Hold on.

814
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:04,704
-Hey, wait. Devon.
-Hey!

815
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:07,623
-Devon! Hold on, wait. Wait.
-Come on, D, wait!

816
00:36:07,707 --> 00:36:10,168
Let go of me. Where's Devon?

817
00:36:10,251 --> 00:36:12,837
Hey, Michaela,
can I get a little help over here?

818
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,756
-Bruce is freaking out.
-What's the matter with him?

819
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:18,259
I don't know. We were having
a nice conversation, smoking weed,

820
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:19,468
and he got a little agitated.

821
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:21,220
Maybe you shouldn't have gotten him high.

822
00:36:21,304 --> 00:36:22,180
Where am I?

823
00:36:22,263 --> 00:36:23,347
[Simone] What happened?

824
00:36:24,140 --> 00:36:25,349
[Bruce] Where's Devon?

825
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:27,560
Uh, I think she went out
for a walk, Bruce.

826
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:28,561
Who are you?

827
00:36:28,644 --> 00:36:29,562
I'm Simone.

828
00:36:29,645 --> 00:36:31,105
No, you're not. She's dead.

829
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,191
[tense music playing]

830
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,444
I'm gonna get a paper bag
and do the breathing thing.

831
00:36:36,527 --> 00:36:39,864
-Um…
-I need my medicine. Where's Devon?

832
00:36:39,947 --> 00:36:40,823
[pills rattling]

833
00:36:40,907 --> 00:36:43,034
Where's my TV?
I want to watch the Indians game.

834
00:36:43,117 --> 00:36:45,369
Hey, hey, hey, it's okay.
It's okay. Just calm down.

835
00:36:45,453 --> 00:36:47,246
Don't you fucking touch me!

836
00:36:48,414 --> 00:36:50,416
[Michaela] Go… Go find Devon, all right?

837
00:36:50,499 --> 00:36:51,834
Check the guest house.

838
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,420
We're gonna find Devon
for you, Bruce, okay?

839
00:36:54,503 --> 00:36:57,089
I don't know what this is.
I'm not supposed to be here.

840
00:36:57,173 --> 00:36:59,800
-[breathing heavily]
-Hey. Hey.

841
00:36:59,884 --> 00:37:01,010
-Do you remember me?
-Mmm.

842
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:02,511
[Michaela] Hmm?

843
00:37:03,679 --> 00:37:05,848
-Hi.
-[Michaela] Hi. Hi.

844
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:07,183
-Hi.
-Hi.

845
00:37:07,266 --> 00:37:08,476
-I know you.
-Yes.

846
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,144
-[Bruce sighs]
-We met.

847
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:12,355
We're gonna find Devon for you, okay?

848
00:37:12,438 --> 00:37:13,940
-Hold my hand.
-Yeah.

849
00:37:14,023 --> 00:37:15,608
-Let's hold hands, all right?
-Okay.

850
00:37:15,691 --> 00:37:18,736
We're gonna sit down and wait for Devon.
Come on. Come on.

851
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,987
-Come on.
-[Peter scoffs]

852
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:22,156
He said he'd smoked before.

853
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,076
Hey.

854
00:37:25,785 --> 00:37:27,411
How was I supposed to know you were sober?

855
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:30,206
Last time I saw you,
you were wasted at Whiskey Joe's.

856
00:37:30,289 --> 00:37:33,084
When you left me so drunk
I couldn't stand. Is that the night?

857
00:37:33,167 --> 00:37:35,169
-You said you were gonna call an Uber.
-Yeah.

858
00:37:37,213 --> 00:37:38,214
I didn't.

859
00:37:38,297 --> 00:37:39,840
I fucked the bartender.

860
00:37:39,924 --> 00:37:42,969
And then I drove drunk and crashed
into a parking meter, got arrested,

861
00:37:43,052 --> 00:37:44,345
and spent the night in jail.

862
00:37:45,638 --> 00:37:48,224
No. What? Why didn't you call me?

863
00:37:48,307 --> 00:37:52,687
You were busy yelling at me
about some fucking Falafel Ball shift.

864
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:53,938
[Morgan and Eddy laugh]

865
00:37:54,021 --> 00:37:56,482
Could you just give us a second, please?

866
00:37:59,694 --> 00:38:01,529
Are you okay? Did you get hurt?

867
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:06,242
No, don't… don't do that. Don't pretend
that you care about me. You went home.

868
00:38:06,325 --> 00:38:09,412
[sighs] You know that I have to go home
to my wife sometimes.

869
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:11,664
That does not mean that I don't love you.

870
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:12,665
You don't love me.

871
00:38:12,748 --> 00:38:16,585
You love who you were in 2009.
You love high school.

872
00:38:17,545 --> 00:38:19,755
I don't understand why you're negging me,

873
00:38:19,839 --> 00:38:22,883
because I… I closed the restaurant early.

874
00:38:22,967 --> 00:38:26,387
I… I lied to my whole family
so that I could come see you.

875
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:28,139
You knew that I wasn't okay.

876
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,392
And you left me there anyway.

877
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:34,895
Go home to Allie.

878
00:38:34,979 --> 00:38:37,148
But I'm leaving her. I am.

879
00:38:37,231 --> 00:38:39,817
I'm gonna break the news to her
sometime, like, next week.

880
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:42,403
I don't want you to leave Allie.
I don't want you.

881
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:44,155
Why?

882
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,949
Because of that guy?
I know it's not that guy.

883
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,284
Because I don't love you.

884
00:38:48,367 --> 00:38:50,077
I've fucked three guys
since I've been here.

885
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,370
You don't mean anything to me.

886
00:38:51,454 --> 00:38:53,748
I don't think about you.
I don't even like you.

887
00:38:53,831 --> 00:38:57,001
You make my life worse. You make me worse.

888
00:38:57,084 --> 00:39:01,881
[sobbing] And you're the thing that I do
when I want to hate myself.

889
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:05,551
If you walked into the ocean right now
and drowned, I would be better off.

890
00:39:06,677 --> 00:39:08,679
[footsteps departing]

891
00:39:13,976 --> 00:39:18,898
[somber music playing]

892
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,818
[music ends]

893
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,071
[Michaela] Everything is okay, Bruce.

894
00:39:25,154 --> 00:39:27,990
Just relax.
We're getting in touch with Devon.

895
00:39:28,074 --> 00:39:29,992
-[Bruce] Hey, beautiful.
-[Michaela] Yeah?

896
00:39:30,076 --> 00:39:32,995
[softly] You want to get out of here?
This house is weird.

897
00:39:33,079 --> 00:39:34,288
I know.

898
00:39:35,081 --> 00:39:37,666
-I'm just not quite ready to leave.
-[Bruce] Mmm.

899
00:39:37,750 --> 00:39:39,251
Can we wait a little bit?

900
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,588
-I want to move around.
-Oh. Uh…

901
00:39:42,671 --> 00:39:44,173
-Okay. Um…
-Yeah.

902
00:39:44,256 --> 00:39:45,925
Bruce, come back. No, come back.

903
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:47,968
Hey, you know what? We could dance.

904
00:39:48,052 --> 00:39:50,179
-Dance? What do you mean?
-Yeah, I like to dance.

905
00:39:50,262 --> 00:39:51,597
-Come on.
-No. There's no music.

906
00:39:51,680 --> 00:39:53,516
Put your arms around me. Take a breath.

907
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:57,103
-No, there's music in the… in the surf.
-Hmm.

908
00:39:57,186 --> 00:39:58,813
[Michaela] Mmm, listen. Listen.

909
00:39:58,896 --> 00:39:59,980
Listen to the waves.

910
00:40:00,064 --> 00:40:01,690
[Bruce breathes deeply]

911
00:40:01,774 --> 00:40:03,776
[pensive music playing]

912
00:40:03,859 --> 00:40:07,238
We were so good together.
Why did you leave?

913
00:40:09,824 --> 00:40:10,908
I'm here now.

914
00:40:12,827 --> 00:40:14,036
[Bruce laughs]

915
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,704
[Michaela] Huh?

916
00:40:15,788 --> 00:40:18,833
Am I lost, or is this real? [laughs]

917
00:40:18,916 --> 00:40:20,000
Does it matter?

918
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:23,671
You feel so good in my arms.

919
00:40:24,630 --> 00:40:25,798
I won't fail you again.

920
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:26,757
You didn't fail.

921
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:29,677
Everything I tried,
it just made you sadder.

922
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:32,763
I didn't know that you were at that point.

923
00:40:32,847 --> 00:40:35,099
There was nothing you could have done.

924
00:40:35,808 --> 00:40:37,143
[Bruce] I was mean to you.

925
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:41,897
I got angry when you were in your moods.

926
00:40:42,982 --> 00:40:43,941
Pissed off.

927
00:40:44,525 --> 00:40:47,027
You were up buzzing around all night,

928
00:40:47,945 --> 00:40:49,447
bursting with words.

929
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,990
Dancing.

930
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:53,617
Music no one else could hear.

931
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,953
Can you hear it now?

932
00:40:56,036 --> 00:40:56,871
Yeah.

933
00:40:57,955 --> 00:40:58,831
[Michaela] Hmm.

934
00:40:58,914 --> 00:40:59,790
I hear,

935
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,292
I think.

936
00:41:01,375 --> 00:41:03,252
[gentle music playing]

937
00:41:05,171 --> 00:41:06,881
You tried to kill Simone.

938
00:41:08,007 --> 00:41:09,633
I couldn't understand that.

939
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:14,263
That is very hard to understand.

940
00:41:16,682 --> 00:41:19,393
[somber music playing]

941
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:23,230
I tried so hard for so long
to get pregnant.

942
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,483
-[Bruce] You did?
-[Michaela] I did.

943
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,778
I kept trying, losing,

944
00:41:29,862 --> 00:41:31,238
and trying and losing.

945
00:41:35,201 --> 00:41:37,953
Our daughters turned out so smart,

946
00:41:39,079 --> 00:41:39,914
beautiful.

947
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:43,626
I wish you could see them now.

948
00:41:45,127 --> 00:41:47,171
I wish I could see my babies too.

949
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:52,134
I'm tired.

950
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:53,594
Yeah?

951
00:41:54,094 --> 00:41:54,929
[Bruce] Mmm.

952
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:56,472
-[Michaela] Mm.
-My legs.

953
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:58,974
Why don't we sit down again?

954
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,434
-Mmm.
-Come on.

955
00:42:02,811 --> 00:42:04,313
Come on, sit over here.

956
00:42:05,064 --> 00:42:07,775
[Bruce] Maybe I'll close my eyes
for a bit.

957
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,360
[Michaela] That's a good idea.

958
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,487
[Bruce exhales]

959
00:42:14,323 --> 00:42:15,491
Ah, here you go.

960
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,493
[Bruce exhales]

961
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,084
Hey.

962
00:42:27,836 --> 00:42:29,255
[Peter] There you go, buddy.

963
00:42:29,338 --> 00:42:30,339
Rest now.

964
00:42:31,257 --> 00:42:32,633
-[Bruce] Mmm.
-[Michaela sniffles]

965
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:36,762
[Bruce snoring]

966
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,768
[Simone] Devon!

967
00:42:44,186 --> 00:42:45,104
Devon!

968
00:42:48,274 --> 00:42:50,651
[Ethan] Go away, monster!

969
00:42:52,111 --> 00:42:53,112
[Simone] Ethan?

970
00:42:55,072 --> 00:42:56,907
Ethan, what are you doing out here?

971
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:00,119
[smacks lips] Me, I'm teleport--

972
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,997
I'm teleporting to my boat to come get me.

973
00:43:03,706 --> 00:43:04,957
[inhales sharply]

974
00:43:05,040 --> 00:43:06,417
-Beam me up!
-Okay.

975
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:08,210
You're drunk. Let me walk you home.

976
00:43:08,294 --> 00:43:09,628
You stay away from me.

977
00:43:09,712 --> 00:43:11,547
I'll help you home, okay?

978
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:15,718
You're enjoying this, aren't you?

979
00:43:15,801 --> 00:43:17,511
Uh-huh, yeah.

980
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:21,181
I'm just another notch
on your little pink belt, right?

981
00:43:21,807 --> 00:43:23,851
Fine, you can get yourself home.

982
00:43:24,393 --> 00:43:25,311
Devon!

983
00:43:26,312 --> 00:43:28,814
-You're a monster, you know that?
-Stop calling me that.

984
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,235
Monster.

985
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:35,571
Hey. You're gonna hurt yourself, okay?

986
00:43:35,654 --> 00:43:36,905
[tense music playing]

987
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:38,699
You're a shell of a person.

988
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,035
I see it now.

989
00:43:42,036 --> 00:43:43,787
Little beady eyes over there.

990
00:43:46,248 --> 00:43:47,333
Destroying me.

991
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:51,086
You stay away from me.

992
00:43:51,170 --> 00:43:53,172
[tense music continues]

993
00:44:04,266 --> 00:44:05,809
[music fades]

994
00:44:06,435 --> 00:44:07,353
There you go.

995
00:44:11,899 --> 00:44:13,108
[exhales]

996
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,443
Nice job in there.

997
00:44:15,736 --> 00:44:17,237
I didn't know what to do.

998
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:19,782
[scoffs, inhales deeply]

999
00:44:20,449 --> 00:44:23,202
Yeah, what a day.
Can't believe we have the gala tomorrow.

1000
00:44:23,285 --> 00:44:24,244
[Peter] Hmm.

1001
00:44:27,039 --> 00:44:30,376
I'm sorry that we never…
got to have a baby, Michaela.

1002
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:35,589
I'm sorry too.

1003
00:44:38,050 --> 00:44:42,054
I know that this year
has been hard for you.

1004
00:44:42,971 --> 00:44:45,683
Rory and his wife announcing
that they were expecting,

1005
00:44:45,766 --> 00:44:49,687
but there's something that…
I need to tell you. [sighs]

1006
00:44:52,189 --> 00:44:53,315
Uh…

1007
00:44:53,399 --> 00:44:55,651
When I said I was in Japan,

1008
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,445
I was actually
at my grandson's christening.

1009
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:02,700
Rory was there, of course, and Sarah too.

1010
00:45:02,783 --> 00:45:03,909
[inhales deeply]

1011
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,160
I was with my kids.

1012
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:07,204
I know.

1013
00:45:09,206 --> 00:45:10,249
Simone told you?

1014
00:45:10,749 --> 00:45:12,501
No, why would Simone know?

1015
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:14,169
Oh, I don't know.

1016
00:45:14,253 --> 00:45:15,254
Um… [chuckles softly]

1017
00:45:15,337 --> 00:45:17,840
Nothing gets by that girl.
I… I thought she figured it out.

1018
00:45:17,923 --> 00:45:21,135
No, I… I figured it out by myself. I…

1019
00:45:21,844 --> 00:45:23,595
I was hurt that you didn't tell me,

1020
00:45:23,679 --> 00:45:25,973
but I understand
why you feel you couldn't.

1021
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:27,391
You do?

1022
00:45:27,975 --> 00:45:31,186
You knew I'd be upset.
Your kids hate me. [chuckles]

1023
00:45:31,770 --> 00:45:33,605
They always have, you know?

1024
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:36,859
They blame me for what happened
with Jocelyn. I'm the villain, right?

1025
00:45:38,944 --> 00:45:42,030
But I want you to have
a relationship with your kids.

1026
00:45:44,032 --> 00:45:45,576
I'm glad you saw the baby.

1027
00:45:48,454 --> 00:45:49,329
[inhales sharply]

1028
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,960
-Can I tell you something cool?
-Hmm.

1029
00:45:55,043 --> 00:45:57,546
When Rory saw me, he started to cry.

1030
00:45:58,797 --> 00:46:00,382
-He did?
-Yeah.

1031
00:46:00,466 --> 00:46:03,135
[inhales deeply] He was just so surprised.

1032
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:06,346
And then Sarah came over,
and she started crying, and then the baby,

1033
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,557
his name's Jonathan,
he started crying. It was funny.

1034
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:09,475
[Peter chuckles]

1035
00:46:09,558 --> 00:46:12,311
I'm so relieved because I thought
you were having an affair.

[inhales deeply]

1037
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,442
We've been through a lot, you and me.

I love you, Mrs. Kell.

1042
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:43,383
Stop following me!

1043
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:47,930
Ethan, get away from the cliff.

1044
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,890
Help! Somebody help me!

1045
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:51,350
I'm trying to help you.

1047

[wind whooshing]

1049
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,773
You did this to me.

1050
00:46:59,775 --> 00:47:00,651
You!

1051
00:47:01,360 --> 00:47:03,529

-[Simone] Help!
-[Michaela] What is it?

1056
00:47:10,536 --> 00:47:12,538
Help! Ethan fell off the cliff
the whole way down.

1057
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,455
Oh my God.

1058
00:47:13,539 --> 00:47:16,375
Call 911. Meet the ambulance out front.

1059
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:17,417
[frantic music playing]

1060
00:47:17,501 --> 00:47:20,629
[Michaela] Hi. I need an ambulance
at 4 Sconset Point.

1061
00:47:20,712 --> 00:47:23,048
A man fell from the bluff. I…

1062
00:47:23,131 --> 00:47:24,383
-I don't know.
-[door opens]

1063
00:47:24,466 --> 00:47:26,093
Yes. Thank you.

1064
00:47:26,176 --> 00:47:27,928
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1065
00:47:28,011 --> 00:47:30,889
I'm so sorry. I've been waiting
in that hot room for three hours.

1066
00:47:30,973 --> 00:47:33,308
Cyrus, I… I can't talk now.
There's been an emergency.

1067
00:47:33,392 --> 00:47:35,811
-I need to speak to you.
-I cannot look at proofs now.

1068

You need to see this photo, ma'am.

Today.

1072
00:47:47,573 --> 00:47:50,075
I was shooting Kewes Point
for your feature.

1073
00:47:50,158 --> 00:47:51,994
I'm sure the magazine
would want to buy it.

1074
00:47:52,077 --> 00:47:53,412
You'll get your money.

1075
00:47:53,912 --> 00:47:54,746
Please leave.
