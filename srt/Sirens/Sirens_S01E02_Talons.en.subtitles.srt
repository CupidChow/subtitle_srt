-Let me in. I'm a popsicle.

39
00:02:37,949 --> 00:02:39,409
What the hell are you doing here?

40
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,452
You're supposed to be gone.
Why are you wet?

41
00:02:41,536 --> 00:02:42,662
-Zeus. Lights.
-Oh.

42
00:02:42,745 --> 00:02:44,622
I just Navy SEALed over
from Jordan's dinghy.

43
00:02:44,706 --> 00:02:46,457
He couldn't get past the rocks,
so I had to swim.

44
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:47,959
Who's Jordan?

45
00:02:48,042 --> 00:02:49,460
Oh, right. That's not his name.

46
00:02:49,544 --> 00:02:50,378
[grunts softly]

47
00:02:50,461 --> 00:02:52,547
Uh, Ethan's boat guy.

48
00:02:52,630 --> 00:02:54,507
Yeah, I met him at a bar last night,

49
00:02:54,591 --> 00:02:56,509
and then he took me back
to your boyfriend's boat.

50
00:02:56,593 --> 00:02:57,802
You were on the Evelina?

51
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,554
With Jordan, yeah.

52
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,513
[grunts]

53
00:03:00,597 --> 00:03:02,015
Oh my-- Do you mean Morgan?

54
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:03,600
His name's Morgan?

55
00:03:03,683 --> 00:03:05,059
Wait, I'm so confused.

56
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:06,895
I feel really weird about it too.

57
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:09,856
But then I saw your boss
in the window all bloody

58
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:11,691
like some kind of dark lord,

59
00:03:11,774 --> 00:03:13,568
and I'm here to bust you out.

60
00:03:14,068 --> 00:03:15,028
Let's go.

61
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,779
What the hell are you talking about?

62
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:19,073
I don't know.
She was doing some kind of, like,

63
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:24,662
uh, some sort of, like,
satanic animal sacrifice.

64
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:27,332
Wait, do you mean her bedroom window?

65
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:29,417
Devon, that wasn't an animal sacrifice.

66
00:03:30,084 --> 00:03:33,087
Barnaby crashed through
her window and died.

67
00:03:33,755 --> 00:03:34,881
Poor thing.

68
00:03:34,964 --> 00:03:35,840
Who's Barnaby?

69
00:03:35,924 --> 00:03:37,634
Her peregrine falcon.

70
00:03:37,717 --> 00:03:39,636
Okay, that helps me not at all.

71
00:03:39,719 --> 00:03:41,179
It's a bird, Devon.

72
00:03:41,262 --> 00:03:43,640
What are you even doing here?
You're supposed to be gone.

73
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:46,226
-I'm worried about you, Simone.
-Okay, why?

74
00:03:46,309 --> 00:03:48,853
Because this Michaela bitch
has her talons so deep in your brain

75
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:51,564
that you can't even tell you're in a cult.

76
00:03:51,648 --> 00:03:53,483
Kiki is my friend.

77
00:03:53,566 --> 00:03:57,237
Friends don't control and isolate you.

78
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,323
Friends don't kick your sister out
like trash.

79
00:04:00,406 --> 00:04:03,159
And friends don't tell you
who you can and cannot date.

80
00:04:03,243 --> 00:04:07,372
Friends don't buy you closets like this.
Are you kidding me? This is your room?

81
00:04:07,455 --> 00:04:10,375
Okay, first of all,
I worked really hard with the designer

82
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,126
on the layout of my suite, okay?

83
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:15,713
Second, Devon,
it was my idea to kick you out.

84
00:04:15,797 --> 00:04:17,757
-Ah.
-Uh-huh. And I stand by it.

85
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,927
Third, she doesn't tell me
who I can and cannot date.

86
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,845
Ethan's her husband's best friend.

87
00:04:22,929 --> 00:04:25,932
It might be weird for her
to suddenly go on double dates with me.

88
00:04:26,015 --> 00:04:29,435
You know,
I spray her underwear with lavender mist.

89
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,271
You what now?

90
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,231
Me and Ethan are not a secret.

91
00:04:33,314 --> 00:04:35,650
I just… I haven't had a chance… Stop it!

92
00:04:35,733 --> 00:04:37,402
-…to tell her about us yet.
-Okay.

93
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:40,029
-But she'd be fine if she knew?
-Yes, of course she'd be fine.

94
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:41,656
Good, 'cause I told her.

95
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:43,157
Wait, what? When? Why?

96
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:45,827
Devon, Devon, no. Why would you do that?

97
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:48,579
I didn't. I was proving a point.
Look how insane you're being.

98
00:04:48,663 --> 00:04:50,873
-You are the worst thing in my life, okay?
-Great.

99
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,583
Tell me all about it
on the way to Buffalo.

100
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:54,419
I'm never going back to Buffalo.

101
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,337
-It's your home.
-No, this is my home.

102
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:58,673
Stop, stop. Stop going through my stuff
and listen to me.

103
00:04:58,756 --> 00:05:00,300
-Okay? Listen, Devon.
-Yes.

104
00:05:00,967 --> 00:05:02,927
This is the happiest
I've ever been. [chuckles]

105
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:06,848
Like… I love this island.

106
00:05:08,933 --> 00:05:10,393
I love who I am here.

107
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,063
-[Simone sighs]
-You wanted to be an attorney.

108
00:05:15,523 --> 00:05:18,359
Kiki has a law degree,
and Kiki says being an attorney…

109
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:21,696
I don't care about Kiki.
Look at me. I care about you. I love you.

110
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:24,073
You and me,

111
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:26,492
we worked so hard to get you into Yale.

112
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:29,704
[laughing] I got myself into Yale.

113
00:05:30,788 --> 00:05:32,081
Oh, sorry.

114
00:05:34,375 --> 00:05:37,086
I just thought that I dropped out
of college, moved home,

115
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:39,172
and worked three jobs
to get you through high school.

116
00:05:39,255 --> 00:05:40,715
I didn't ask you to do that.

117
00:05:40,798 --> 00:05:42,800
Who else was gonna do it?

118
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:48,097
Simone, I am the only person
who has always had your back.

119
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,350
That's not true. Kiki has my back.

120
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:53,853
-What?
-Are you taking your meds?

121
00:05:53,936 --> 00:05:56,356
Hey, don't, Devon. No, don't. Don't.

122
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,609
Don't do that. Don't make this about me
when this is about you.

123
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:02,487
-Are you taking them? Yes or no?
-Yes, I take my fucking meds.

124
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:04,489
Oh, there she is.
Still got a little fight in her.

125
00:06:04,572 --> 00:06:08,826
And fuck you
because you're not worried about me.

126
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:11,579
Devon, no.
This is about you and your shit.

127
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:13,373
-You just don't want to go home.
-That is…

128
00:06:13,456 --> 00:06:15,291
And I don't blame you, okay?

129
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,796
But that does not mean that you get to
show up here and shit all over my success.

130
00:06:19,879 --> 00:06:23,633
What success?!
You are misting underwear with lavender.

131
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,677
[tearfully] And by the way, I did leave.

132
00:06:26,761 --> 00:06:28,304
I was the original leaver.

133
00:06:28,388 --> 00:06:30,723
I just came back
'cause I'm such a good sister.

134
00:06:30,807 --> 00:06:32,850
And I'm… Hey, I'm grateful for that.

135
00:06:32,934 --> 00:06:35,520
Ser-- Seriously. And I always will be.

136
00:06:36,062 --> 00:06:39,565
All right? But I've been out
of high school for seven years.

137
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:42,527
You're choosing this now.

138
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:45,154
I have never chosen anything
in my entire life, Simone.

139
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,322
Oh my God. No, okay.

140
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,408
What about Raymond?

141
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,328
-That's my friend.
-[laughs]

142
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:55,790
He's a married loser
who makes you feel bad about yourself.

143
00:06:55,873 --> 00:06:58,042
Why would you spend any time with him?

144
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,757
[sighs]

145
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:05,842
I'm sorry.

146
00:07:06,884 --> 00:07:08,553
Look, like… [inhales shakily]

147
00:07:09,595 --> 00:07:11,722
I… I know that you're struggling, okay?

148
00:07:12,515 --> 00:07:13,891
But you have to let go

149
00:07:14,392 --> 00:07:15,935
of what doesn't serve you.

150
00:07:16,436 --> 00:07:19,105
-That's what Kiki always says…
-Oh my God, stop saying her name.

151
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:21,649
-Kiki. Kiki. Kiki. Kiki.
-Stop saying her name.

152
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:23,609
-Stop it. Jesus!
-What's going on?

153
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,319
-Oh my--
-What the fuck?! [sighs]

154
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:26,487
Is she wet?

155
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,740
She, uh… swam here, apparently.

156
00:07:29,824 --> 00:07:31,617
Are you part mermaid, Devon?

157
00:07:31,701 --> 00:07:34,787
Uh, if you don't mind, we're sort of
in the middle of something right now.

158
00:07:34,871 --> 00:07:38,416
Oh my God, so are we. Did Simone
tell you about our recent trauma?

159
00:07:38,499 --> 00:07:40,835
Yeah, how are you holding up?

160
00:07:41,878 --> 00:07:44,130
-Were you able to get back to sleep?
-No, no.

161
00:07:44,213 --> 00:07:46,507
I keep seeing
his little eyes looking at me.

162
00:07:46,591 --> 00:07:48,509
He was trying to come home to you, Kiki.

163
00:07:48,593 --> 00:07:50,928
-That's my theory.
-I shouldn't have let him go.

164
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,181
No, this is not your fault, Kiki.

165
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:55,057
He told me he was ready.

166
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:57,393
-Hey hey.
-Hey hey.

167
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,482
Well, I really hate
to rush your bird grief,

168
00:08:02,565 --> 00:08:04,692
but I think we should
probably finish packing.

169
00:08:04,775 --> 00:08:05,860
Are you going somewhere?

170
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:07,820
-Yes, we're going to Buffalo together.
-No.

171
00:08:07,904 --> 00:08:09,113
No, I'm not, Devon.

172
00:08:09,197 --> 00:08:11,073
-I'm not going anywhere.
-[Devon] Yes, you are.

173
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,951
-No, I'm not.
-[Devon] Mmm.

174
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:15,953
You are, though.

175
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:18,915
-I'm not, though.
-I'm not leaving this island without you.

176
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,958
You're gonna grow old and die here then

177
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:22,668
'cause, uh, I'm not leaving.

178
00:08:22,752 --> 00:08:24,295
Mmm, cool.

179
00:08:24,378 --> 00:08:27,423
I guess I'll just be right here,
festering and decomposing.

180
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,051
-Don't you dare sit on my couch.
-One cheek, two cheek.

181
00:08:30,134 --> 00:08:33,804
Oh, I… I love this for you two,
this little pre-dawn sister spat,

182
00:08:33,888 --> 00:08:35,806
but I have got to get some rest.

183
00:08:35,890 --> 00:08:39,894
Devon, let's move you to the guest house.
You'll be much more comfortable there.

184
00:08:39,977 --> 00:08:40,811
Jose.

185
00:08:42,271 --> 00:08:43,105
What?

186
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:45,691
Will you follow me, Miss DeWitt?

187
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:50,196
Uh, no, I'm going to stay here.

188
00:08:50,279 --> 00:08:52,865
Oh, thank you for understanding.

189
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:55,451
But…

190
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:58,037
Jose, let's meet tomorrow to discuss

191
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:00,540
the security breach
that occurred on your watch.

192
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,584
-Of course, mi amor. This way, please.
-Thank you.

193
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,419
Sweet dreams, Devon.

194
00:09:05,503 --> 00:09:06,420
[Jose clears throat]

195
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,631
[pensive music playing]

196
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:19,725
[Devon] They sleep together?

197
00:09:20,810 --> 00:09:24,272
Ugh! God, every time I think
this place can't get more fucked,

198
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:25,690
it just gets more fucked.

199
00:09:25,773 --> 00:09:27,858
I told you to leave
and never come back, dummy.

200
00:09:27,942 --> 00:09:31,862
What was I supposed to do?
My sister is clearly in trouble.

201
00:09:32,488 --> 00:09:34,073
-I'm sorry.
-For what?

202
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:35,741
[siren chirps]

203
00:09:36,826 --> 00:09:38,160
Are you kidding me?

204
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,538
-Breaking and entering and trespassing.
-[car doors close]

205
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:42,123
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

206
00:09:42,206 --> 00:09:43,207
[police radio chatter]

207
00:09:43,291 --> 00:09:46,002
[officer] Devon DeWitt,
you have the right to remain silent.

208
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:49,005
Anything you say can and will be
used against you in a court of law.

209
00:09:49,088 --> 00:09:51,716
-You have a right to an attorney.
-[Devon] If you cannot afford one…

210
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:54,844
[unsettling music playing]

211
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:02,393
Hey, Simone.

212
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,313
Mmm, Kiki.

213
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:09,400
-[exhales]
-Why didn't you tell me you had a sister?

214
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:12,403
Um…

215
00:10:17,158 --> 00:10:19,493
It's… just hard to explain.

216
00:10:21,329 --> 00:10:23,247
-It all kinda is.
-Hmm.

217
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:25,458
-I get that.
-Hmm.

218
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:30,546
It seems like an omission, though,
when you know so much about me.

219
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,216
She just has issues.

220
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:38,596
She spends all her time
with my alcoholic dad.

221
00:10:38,679 --> 00:10:41,974
Another lost soul washed up
on our island, huh?

222
00:10:42,058 --> 00:10:43,142
[Simone] Hmm.

223
00:10:45,603 --> 00:10:47,688
How old was she when your mom died?

224
00:10:47,772 --> 00:10:48,731
Twelve.

225
00:10:48,814 --> 00:10:50,816
[Michaela breathes deeply]

226
00:10:51,942 --> 00:10:53,277
That's a tough age.

227
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,446
I mean,

228
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:59,492
my mom was sick, so that was

229
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:02,203
an explanation,

230
00:11:02,286 --> 00:11:06,123
but a drunk driver killing your mother
must have left the two of you in such…

231
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:08,876
such despair.

232
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,545
Yeah.

233
00:11:13,297 --> 00:11:14,674
[tender music playing]

234
00:11:14,757 --> 00:11:15,633
It's just so…

235
00:11:17,301 --> 00:11:20,012
odd that you chose
not to mention her to me.

236
00:11:22,098 --> 00:11:23,974
She makes me sad, Kiki.

237
00:11:27,937 --> 00:11:29,814
I didn't want to be sad here.

238
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,024
That's all.

239
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:38,322
Is there anything else
you haven't told me, for whatever reason?

240
00:11:39,573 --> 00:11:40,950
I won't be angry.

241
00:11:47,832 --> 00:11:49,750
You know everything about me.

242
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:02,221
The Mandolina. Or the Gordita.

243
00:12:02,888 --> 00:12:05,516
-The Eddie-lina? Something-lina.
-[sighs]

244
00:12:05,599 --> 00:12:08,227
Anyway, whatever. It doesn't matter
what the boat was called, okay?

245
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,272
I wasn't breaking into the Cliff House

246
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,190
because I am a guest

247
00:12:14,108 --> 00:12:15,151
at the Cliff House.

248
00:12:15,234 --> 00:12:17,695
Hmm. Not according to Mrs. Kell.

249
00:12:17,778 --> 00:12:20,489
Well, of course she would say that.
You know what else she's doing?

250
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,242
Holding my sister, Simone, there
against her will.

251
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:25,035
[chuckles softly] I love Simone.

252
00:12:25,619 --> 00:12:27,121
She got me Hamilton tickets.

253
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,247
[woman laughs]

254
00:12:28,330 --> 00:12:31,709
I don't think she's a prisoner.
She seems pretty happy to me.

255
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,836
She's brainwashed!

256
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,464
Do you have any priors, Miss DeWitt?

257
00:12:38,674 --> 00:12:40,426
[breathes deeply]

258
00:12:40,509 --> 00:12:42,511
[pensive music playing]

259
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:48,768
[relaxing vocalization]

260
00:13:57,962 --> 00:13:59,088
[music fades]

261
00:13:59,171 --> 00:14:00,589
[gasps]

262
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:01,632
[exhales]

263
00:14:02,967 --> 00:14:04,969
[seagull cawing]

264
00:14:13,310 --> 00:14:17,439
Mr. Kell, I had no idea that you were up.
Missy said that you were sleeping.

265
00:14:18,023 --> 00:14:21,777
No, I couldn't sleep.
I'm all turned around with this jet lag.

266
00:14:21,861 --> 00:14:24,029
Here, let me do that for you.

267
00:14:24,113 --> 00:14:25,239
Please, I got it.

268
00:14:27,825 --> 00:14:29,451
-How are things?
-Things are good.

269
00:14:30,411 --> 00:14:32,162
-Getting ready for the gala.
-Hmm.

270
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,206
Battening down the hatches
and that kind of thing.

271
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:36,667
Uh-huh. How's the little guy, Tyson?

272
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:40,045
Well, he's not very little anymore.
He just turned 13.

273
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:42,256
No. He's a teenager?

274
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:45,718
Yep. He just got
his purple belt in karate, actually.

275
00:14:45,801 --> 00:14:48,846
Oh boy. Not gonna mess with him.

276
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,723
Can I make you some breakfast?

277
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:52,892
Or dinner, I guess, at this point?
You were so delayed.

278
00:14:52,975 --> 00:14:54,018
No, thanks.

279
00:14:54,101 --> 00:14:56,770
I'm good with the caffeine and the Times.

280
00:15:00,524 --> 00:15:04,528
Remember when I had teenagers
running around in here, Patrice?

281
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:05,571
Yeah.

282
00:15:05,654 --> 00:15:09,742
Rory ate so much, I couldn't even keep
the pantry stocked up enough for him.

283
00:15:09,825 --> 00:15:13,579
And Sarah, upstairs,
blasting Taylor Swift at all hours.

284
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:15,789
It used to drive me crazy back then.

285
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:21,378
You treasure this time with your boy.

286
00:15:22,588 --> 00:15:24,381
These are the best times of your life.

287
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:26,926
I will. I do.

288
00:15:31,263 --> 00:15:32,431
[retching]

289
00:15:32,973 --> 00:15:34,767
[exhales, sniffles]

290
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:35,684
[sighs]

291
00:15:36,518 --> 00:15:38,479
-[woman] So, what's your name?
-I'm Devon.

292
00:15:38,562 --> 00:15:41,315
-[woman] Kevin?
-No, Devon. With a D.

293
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:44,151
-So, what did you get busted for?
-Trespassing.

294
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,111
Tight! What house?

295
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:47,696
[inhales deeply]

296
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,240
I don't know. Some mansion on a cliff.

297
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:52,785
The Cliff House?

298
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:57,164
-[bucket clangs]
-[clears throat]

299
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,375
You tried to break into
Michaela Kell's house?

300
00:16:00,042 --> 00:16:03,379
-You know her.
-No, I don't.

301
00:16:03,462 --> 00:16:04,630
[suspenseful music playing]

302
00:16:04,713 --> 00:16:06,674
-Kinda seems like you do.
-Mm-mm.

303
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:07,675
[shushing]

304
00:16:08,509 --> 00:16:11,553
[softly] Careful what you say.
They have spies everywhere.

305
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:13,639
[camera whirring]

306
00:16:14,723 --> 00:16:16,558
-[softly] Oh. Okay.
-[shushing]

307
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,063
I know the kids.

308
00:16:21,146 --> 00:16:23,440
Rory and Sarah Kell went
to boarding school with me.

309
00:16:24,066 --> 00:16:26,652
Wait. Peter and Michaela have kids?

310
00:16:26,735 --> 00:16:27,569
No.

311
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,238
Not Michaela.

312
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,907
Their mom's Jocelyn Kell, the first wife.

313
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:36,370
But no one's seen or heard from her
since Michaela showed up.

314
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,081
Like, not a peep.

315
00:16:39,164 --> 00:16:40,040
[inhales deeply]

316
00:16:40,124 --> 00:16:43,794
And you know,
I don't like to spread rumors, Kevin,

317
00:16:43,877 --> 00:16:47,423
but… people think she killed her.

318
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:49,508
[suspenseful music continues]

319
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,052
People think Michaela
killed the first wife?

320
00:16:52,136 --> 00:16:52,970
Yes.

321
00:16:54,972 --> 00:16:55,931
[exhales sharply]

322
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:58,475
Okay, but not like actual murder, right?

323
00:16:58,559 --> 00:17:02,354
I mean, not like,
Michaela with a lead pipe in the library.

324
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:04,606
She pushed her off a cliff.

325
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:05,607
[gasps]

326
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:11,071
I'm telling you, she's a monster.

327
00:17:14,658 --> 00:17:15,701
[woman sighs]

328
00:17:18,120 --> 00:17:19,663
Hey, have you, uh,

329
00:17:20,497 --> 00:17:23,667
ever heard anything
about it being a… a cult?

330
00:17:23,751 --> 00:17:25,544
Oh, it's definitely a cult. Yeah, yeah.

331
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:28,881
But to be fair, I think everything's
a cult because I was in NXIVM briefly.

332
00:17:28,964 --> 00:17:30,674
-[gasps] Shut up.
-I know.

333
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:33,093
I was supposed to be in the documentary,
but I got adult mono.

334
00:17:34,845 --> 00:17:35,679
Okay.

335
00:17:35,763 --> 00:17:37,056
[curious music playing]

336
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,142
How did you get out of the cult?

337
00:17:42,811 --> 00:17:44,229
[seagulls cawing]

338
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:47,733
Look who's up.

339
00:17:47,816 --> 00:17:50,652
Hey. How you holding up?

340
00:17:50,736 --> 00:17:53,614
I heard about the bird
kamakaze-ing through the window.

341
00:17:53,697 --> 00:17:54,531
You okay?

342
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,868
Barnaby. His name was Barnaby.

343
00:17:58,869 --> 00:17:59,703
Right.

344
00:18:00,496 --> 00:18:01,914
I'm so sorry, honey.

345
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:06,001
I came in to comfort you,
but you were already gone.

346
00:18:06,085 --> 00:18:08,837
Jose said that you slept with Simone.

347
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:12,091
Well, I was upset,
and you were nowhere to be found.

348
00:18:12,174 --> 00:18:16,428
[Peter] I know. But you think
you should be so cuddly with Simone?

349
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:18,847
-I mean, she's your employee, honey.
-[phones chime]

350
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:20,724
Can you give us a minute, Patrice?

351
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:22,684
Yes. Sorry, Mrs. Kell.

352
00:18:22,768 --> 00:18:26,188
-Carl.
-Thanks, Patrice. Appreciate you, Carl.

353
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,192
I sexted you yesterday.

354
00:18:30,275 --> 00:18:32,694
Ah. Did I forget to write you back?

355
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,364
You saw it. It was seen.

356
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:38,909
Oh, Lewis was talking my ear off
on the whole flight,

357
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:42,246
and it just felt weird
to be sexting with my wife

358
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:44,790
while he was droning on
about security futures.

359
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:45,707
[Michaela] Hmm.

360
00:18:47,376 --> 00:18:49,086
Can I make it up to you?

361
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,421
My morning is blissfully free.

362
00:18:51,505 --> 00:18:52,631
-Yeah?
-Mm-hmm.

363
00:18:52,714 --> 00:18:53,715
[footsteps approaching]

364
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:55,342
Sorry. Um…

365
00:18:55,425 --> 00:18:57,469
Oh, Simone, it's okay. Come on in.

366
00:18:57,553 --> 00:18:59,388
-Good morning, Simone.
-Good morning.

367
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,266
Thank you for working
on a holiday weekend.

368
00:19:02,349 --> 00:19:04,434
Oh, my pleasure. Welcome home.

369
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:08,021
Oh, I printed you out
the itinerary for today.

370
00:19:08,105 --> 00:19:10,232
-Because I know you like a hard copy.
-All right.

371
00:19:10,315 --> 00:19:12,234
-Rockin' it analog.
-[Simone] Right. [chuckles]

372
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,944
Whoa.

373
00:19:14,027 --> 00:19:16,697
Vanity Fair is today?
I thought we already did that.

374
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:19,658
No, no. That was the interview.
Today's the photo shoot with everyone.

375
00:19:19,741 --> 00:19:21,660
Ah. No. I can't do it today. I'm busy.

376
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,830
-You just said you were blissfully free.
-[softly] For fun stuff.

377
00:19:24,913 --> 00:19:26,373
I'll give you two some space.

378
00:19:26,456 --> 00:19:28,417
No. It's okay, Simone. You can stay.

379
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,669
What is it with you recently?

380
00:19:30,752 --> 00:19:33,589
Don't you care
about raptor conservation anymore?

381
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:36,133
-You know I do.
-[Michaela] Well, we need this PR.

382
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:38,552
The preserve needs this PR.

383
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:42,472
We're asking folks to plonk down
$10,000 a plate for this gala,

384
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,808
so you need to be in the photo.

385
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:46,143
You and me.

386
00:19:47,477 --> 00:19:48,896
You're absolutely right.

387
00:19:49,521 --> 00:19:50,480
I'll be there.

388
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,152
-I got something for you.
-Yeah?

389
00:20:00,991 --> 00:20:02,034
From Magpie.

390
00:20:02,117 --> 00:20:03,577
[Michaela] Aw.

391
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:07,414
You're the sweetest.
Every time you're in Tokyo, you remember.

392
00:20:07,497 --> 00:20:08,332
Hey.

393
00:20:09,166 --> 00:20:12,753
This is from Magpie Chocolate
on Cat Street in Harajuku?

394
00:20:12,836 --> 00:20:14,504
Mm-hmm. Made a special trip.

395
00:20:14,588 --> 00:20:17,299
-Love you, honey.
-Aw. I love you.

396
00:20:17,925 --> 00:20:19,301
[phone buzzing]

397
00:20:19,384 --> 00:20:20,886
[contemplative music playing]

398
00:20:20,969 --> 00:20:22,679
Hello. This is Simone for Mrs. Kell.

399
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:33,148
[Simone] Good morning. Good morning.

400
00:20:33,232 --> 00:20:34,483
What's your ETA here?

401
00:20:34,566 --> 00:20:37,152
The ETA for installing an oversized
eyelash window with storm-rated…

402
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,487
Just give me a time.

403
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:40,322
-Two hours.
-[Simone] Okay.

404
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,741
Uh, small change of plan.

405
00:20:42,824 --> 00:20:46,954
Michaela wants to do Barnaby's funeral
on the beach after the photo shoot,

406
00:20:47,037 --> 00:20:48,956
so I need you guys to pause here

407
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,291
and, chop-chop, go set that up.

408
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,710
We're in the middle of installing
an oversized eyelash window…

409
00:20:53,794 --> 00:20:55,045
-Right.
-…with storm-rated glass.

410
00:20:55,128 --> 00:20:57,464
But we need
30 folding chairs on the beach,

411
00:20:57,547 --> 00:20:59,341
flower arrangements, candles, a podium.

412
00:20:59,424 --> 00:21:02,219
Kiki's got an oboist coming in. A harp.

413
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:05,931
-Harp? Excellent.
-Yeah. She wants beachy, carefree.

414
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:08,183
-No stress but deeply elegant.
-[Jose] Harp on the beach.

415
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:09,476
-And designed.
-[phone whooshes]

416
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:11,061
-[phones ding, chime]
-Mm-hmm.

417
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,479
[laughing]

418
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,231
Stop texting about me, Jose.

419
00:21:14,856 --> 00:21:15,857
-I'm not.
-[phone whooshes]

420
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,234
[phone buzzing]

421
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,528
[suspenseful music playing]

422
00:21:20,654 --> 00:21:21,863
Oh. Um…

423
00:21:22,614 --> 00:21:24,366
Hi. Uh…

424
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:29,246
Thanks for returning my call.

425
00:21:29,329 --> 00:21:30,247
Um…

426
00:21:32,082 --> 00:21:32,916
Correct.

427
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:36,837
Mrs. Kell wants the chocolate
from the Tokyo location,

428
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:39,047
Cat Street in Harajuku.

429
00:21:39,631 --> 00:21:41,633
No. Yeah. Yeah.

430
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:45,721
She knows that
there's a Magpie Chocolate in SoHo,

431
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,725
but she wants it from Tokyo,
overnighted here.

432
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:52,519
I don't know why,

433
00:21:52,602 --> 00:21:57,149
but, um, it's what she wants,
so just charge us whatever.

434
00:21:57,649 --> 00:21:59,026
Okay. Arigato.

435
00:21:59,109 --> 00:22:01,111
[gentle music playing]

436
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,418
[music ends]

437
00:22:17,127 --> 00:22:20,047
No, my dad would
literally play volleyball with Keith.

438
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,966
Just bump, set, spike. All smiles.

439
00:22:23,050 --> 00:22:25,260
He even went to some
of the weird scarf meetings,

440
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:28,805
and everyone thought he was,
like, in NXIVM for real. So silly.

441
00:22:29,389 --> 00:22:33,894
But, yeah, he just played along,
and then one day, boom, I was out.

442
00:22:33,977 --> 00:22:35,145
[intriguing music playing]

443
00:22:35,228 --> 00:22:37,147
So, he just fully integrated himself.

444
00:22:37,230 --> 00:22:39,107
Yeah. For me.

445
00:22:40,108 --> 00:22:41,109
Interesting.

446
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:45,280
-[officer] DeWitt! Time to go.
-[keys jangling]

447
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:46,823
-Go where?
-[door unlocking]

448
00:22:46,907 --> 00:22:49,159
-[officer] Unless you'd rather stay.
-No, thank you.

449
00:22:49,242 --> 00:22:50,494
[cell door opens]

450
00:22:50,577 --> 00:22:52,954
-Good luck, Kevin.
-[Devon] See you, Lily-Rose.

451
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:56,416
I have to do the other side.

452
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:57,376
Ma'am?

453
00:22:58,126 --> 00:23:00,962
Well, that looks ridiculous.
She looks like shit.

454
00:23:01,671 --> 00:23:02,798
[Devon sighs]

455
00:23:02,881 --> 00:23:04,132
Watch your step.

456
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:07,135
Raise your arms.

457
00:23:07,219 --> 00:23:09,054
[Michaela] Oh, you can
leave her cuffed, Rosie.

458
00:23:09,638 --> 00:23:10,639
-[Rosie] Oh, sure.
-Mm-hmm.

459
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:13,308
Ow. My God.

460
00:23:15,685 --> 00:23:17,145
How's your dad, honey?

461
00:23:17,854 --> 00:23:20,649
[Rosie] He's in remission now.
Yeah, thanks for asking.

462
00:23:20,732 --> 00:23:23,819
He was so touched by
the edible arrangement you sent.

463
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,321
[Michaela] Oh, well,
he's always in our prayers.

464
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,407
-[Rosie] Thanks.
-You can leave us now. Thank you.

465
00:23:33,036 --> 00:23:34,454
-[Michaela sighs]
-[door closes]

466
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,289
Officer Coffin's a friend of mine.

467
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:39,000
She called me after she ran your name
in the system and found out

468
00:23:39,084 --> 00:23:41,503
you'd been arrested
48 hours ago in Buffalo.

469
00:23:42,170 --> 00:23:46,341
Uh, driving under the influence,
resisting arrest.

470
00:23:48,343 --> 00:23:51,596
You threw a Four Loko at a cop
and called him a little bitch?

471
00:23:52,389 --> 00:23:55,350
-Sounds like me.
-Are you aware of what a big deal this is?

472
00:23:55,434 --> 00:23:56,852
It's your second DUI.

473
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,981
In New York State, that's grounds
for up to four years in jail.

474
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,067
Did you tell Simone about this?

475
00:24:04,151 --> 00:24:05,694
No. No.

476
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:10,282
I thought that, um, with your mom,
it would be too upsetting for her.

477
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:13,827
What do you mean?

478
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,246
Well, your mother was killed
by a drunk driver.

479
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:18,540
Oh.

480
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,625
Right.

481
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:26,131
[chuckles softly]

482
00:24:26,882 --> 00:24:28,592
Can I do something for you,

483
00:24:28,675 --> 00:24:31,094
or did you just come
to read me my rap sheet?

484
00:24:31,178 --> 00:24:32,888
Well, you know,
to be honest with you, Devon,

485
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:36,725
I was gonna just let you simmer
in here for a day to prove a point,

486
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:40,812
but I do not want to be the reason
you're extradited home to do hard time.

487
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,022
That's very generous of you.

488
00:24:42,105 --> 00:24:43,231
These are my terms.

489
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,776
You go directly to the ferry
right now and go home.

490
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,612
For real this time.

491
00:24:48,695 --> 00:24:49,613
-Or…
-No.

492
00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:51,740
-Or… Or…
-Mm-mm. No, no, no.

493
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:55,827
You can accept my apology
for bad behavior.

494
00:24:57,537 --> 00:24:58,747
Very bad behavior.

495
00:24:58,830 --> 00:24:59,789
[inhales deeply]

496
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:04,085
And give me another chance, as your guest.

497
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:06,838
Why would I do that?

498
00:25:08,632 --> 00:25:10,050
Because you're merciful.

499
00:25:12,677 --> 00:25:14,221
And we both love Simone.

500
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:19,768
Simone has made it crystal clear
that she wants you to go.

501
00:25:21,978 --> 00:25:23,688
You don't have a sister, do you?

502
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:27,192
Sisters say mean shit all the time.

503
00:25:27,275 --> 00:25:29,277
I mean, they claw each other's faces off,

504
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:32,572
but no one knows you like a sister,
and no one loves you better.

505
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,200
Trust me, Simone and I are very close.

506
00:25:36,201 --> 00:25:37,035
Yeah?

507
00:25:37,661 --> 00:25:41,039
If you're so close,
then why didn't she tell me about you?

508
00:25:41,122 --> 00:25:44,167
If you're so close,
why didn't she tell you about me?

509
00:25:45,835 --> 00:25:49,422
Seems like one of us doesn't know Simone
as well as we thought we did.

510
00:25:49,506 --> 00:25:52,050
That'd be you. I know her super well.
I was just being rhetorical.

511
00:25:52,133 --> 00:25:53,218
[Michaela sighs]

512
00:25:53,301 --> 00:25:55,929
You know, Devon,
I'm not the monster that you think I am.

513
00:25:56,471 --> 00:25:59,057
I take care of everything in my orb.

514
00:25:59,140 --> 00:26:00,559
Big and small.

515
00:26:01,059 --> 00:26:02,644
Prey and predator.

516
00:26:03,144 --> 00:26:04,271
I know.

517
00:26:06,314 --> 00:26:07,816
Maybe you can help me.

518
00:26:09,150 --> 00:26:10,819
Let me stay for the weekend.

519
00:26:12,195 --> 00:26:13,863
And take me under your wing.

520
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,080
Please help me.

521
00:26:23,373 --> 00:26:24,749
Like you helped Simone.

522
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:27,877
Teach me the "hey hey heys."

523
00:26:33,133 --> 00:26:35,552
All right, but you step out of line once

524
00:26:35,635 --> 00:26:39,222
or you interfere with my gala in any way,
and I will put you right back in here.

525
00:26:39,306 --> 00:26:40,181
Understood.

526
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:42,058
-Or worse.
-I don't doubt it.

527
00:26:42,851 --> 00:26:43,685
[sighs]

528
00:26:44,978 --> 00:26:47,314
Jose is outside.

529
00:26:47,897 --> 00:26:49,733
He will bring you back to the house.

530
00:26:49,816 --> 00:26:52,110
Thank you, Michaela. Really.

531
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:54,154
And it's "hey hey."

532
00:26:58,825 --> 00:26:59,701
[door closes]

[panting]

536
00:27:35,111 --> 00:27:36,863
[Eddy] Whoo!

537
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,406
Nice work, boys!

538
00:27:38,948 --> 00:27:40,867
-[megaphone feedback]
-[Simone] Hey, guys.

539
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:43,370
Hi. Uh, this just in.

540
00:27:43,453 --> 00:27:47,207
Michaela is concerned
about it being too salty down there,

541
00:27:47,290 --> 00:27:50,502
so she wants to move
the funeral to the aviary.

542
00:27:50,585 --> 00:27:53,004
-All those chairs need to come back up.
-But we just--

543
00:27:53,088 --> 00:27:54,589
Thank you so much.

544
00:27:55,173 --> 00:27:57,175
[men groaning]

545
00:27:58,176 --> 00:27:59,969
Okay, here we are.

546
00:28:00,053 --> 00:28:02,514
Please, come in. Make yourself at home.

547
00:28:02,597 --> 00:28:05,058
Mrs. Kell had us buy you
some new clothes, okay?

548
00:28:05,141 --> 00:28:07,060
They're upstairs in the bedroom.

549
00:28:07,143 --> 00:28:10,063
Uh, the ones you arrived in
are gonna be laundered, so.

550
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,147
-Great.
-Yeah.

551
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:16,194
She would also love for you to change
before being seen on the property.

552
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:17,862
-Copy that.
-Yeah.

553
00:28:17,946 --> 00:28:20,490
I imagine you're gonna want
to take a little nap, no?

554
00:28:20,573 --> 00:28:22,158
Well, after your night in the slammer.

555
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,411
-Hmm. Ha-ha.
-[inhales sharply]

556
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:25,954
Hey.

557
00:28:26,746 --> 00:28:27,914
Anything else you need?

558
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:31,543
Um, yeah, I need my phone back
from Morgan. He works for Ethan.

559
00:28:31,626 --> 00:28:33,670
Certainly. We can reach out to him.

560
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:37,257
And I'm going to tell Simone that
you are back from the lighthouse tour.

561
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,591
-¿Sí?
-[clicks tongue]

562
00:28:39,259 --> 00:28:40,260
Thank you, Jose.

563
00:28:40,343 --> 00:28:43,179
Good. Stay out of trouble, neck-licker.

564
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:46,391
-Hey. [chuckles]
-Bye.

565
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:47,851
-[Jose] Adiós.

[sighs]

568
00:28:56,192 --> 00:28:57,527
Fuck you, Michaela.

569
00:29:05,034 --> 00:29:06,745
Fuck you, Michaela.

570
00:29:09,789 --> 00:29:11,124
Fuck you, Michaela.

571

[music fades]

572
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,599
Fuck you, Michaela.

[indistinct chatter]

578
00:29:54,709 --> 00:29:56,461
You're late. Head over to HMU.

579
00:29:57,003 --> 00:29:58,713
-Uh, who?
-[woman] Hair and makeup.

580
00:29:59,214 --> 00:30:02,634
Oh, I'm not a part of… whatever this is.

581
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:04,010
I'm just looking for Simone.

582
00:30:04,594 --> 00:30:05,595
She's in VIP.

583
00:30:06,387 --> 00:30:07,347
Upstairs.

584
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,893

588
00:30:30,703 --> 00:30:31,579
Simone?

["From the Start" by Laufey playing]

591
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,755
Simone?

00:30:43,174 --> 00:30:44,676
[women laughing]

593
00:30:44,759 --> 00:30:45,760
Simone?

594
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:49,389
Ahh!

595
00:30:50,223 --> 00:30:51,391
[women in unison] Hi!

596
00:30:51,474 --> 00:30:52,308
Jesus!

597
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,435
-[Simone] Oh my God, Dev.
-[Devon exhales]

598
00:30:55,186 --> 00:30:57,272
-You look gorgeous.
-[Devon] Uh…

599
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,148
[laughing] What the fuck is on their face?

600
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,067
[Simone] It's an infrared sauna mask.

601
00:31:01,150 --> 00:31:04,529
-You want to try it? It feels amazing.
-It's great for eczema.

602
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,281
I don't have, uh…

603
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,741
What is all this?

604
00:31:08,825 --> 00:31:10,743
Uh, it's glam for the Vanity Fair shoot.

605
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:13,913
They're doing a feature
on the Preservation Society.

606
00:31:13,997 --> 00:31:15,999
This is the VIP glam area.

607
00:31:16,082 --> 00:31:18,376
This is Cloe, Lisa, and Astrid.

608
00:31:18,459 --> 00:31:19,836
[women in unison] Hi!

609
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:21,170
[Devon] Okay. Hi.

610
00:31:21,713 --> 00:31:22,839
[Simone] How was town?

611
00:31:22,922 --> 00:31:24,716
Kiki said you did the lighthouse tour.

612
00:31:25,675 --> 00:31:28,177
Well, you know me and lighthouses.

613
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:30,138
Actually, can we get back to this?

614
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:33,975
Could you make this, um,
a… a touch messier?

615
00:31:34,058 --> 00:31:36,311
It just looks a little too planned.

616
00:31:36,811 --> 00:31:37,854
[woman] Of course.

617
00:31:38,354 --> 00:31:41,316
You must be starving.
Don't let us keep you from the buffet.

618
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:42,358
[Devon] Hmm.

619
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,860
I, uh… I am.

620
00:31:43,943 --> 00:31:47,405
Uh, I can't find it, though. Can you…
Can you show me where it is, Simone?

621
00:31:48,448 --> 00:31:49,782
Do you mind, Kiki?

622
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,451
Mmm, I'll grab you for the meeting.

623

[Cloe, Lisa, Astrid] Bye, Devon!

624
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:56,664

626
00:31:58,750 --> 00:31:59,751

-Try the coffee.

It's really important.

634
00:32:21,230 --> 00:32:22,065
Okay.

635
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:23,942
I, um…

636
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:26,194
I don't really know

637
00:32:27,487 --> 00:32:28,488
where to begin.

638
00:32:28,571 --> 00:32:31,199
You look… Like, you look really pretty.

639
00:32:31,282 --> 00:32:32,408
That's not--

640
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:35,954
No, the only person who doesn't know
how beautiful you are… is you.

641
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,121
Barf.

642
00:32:37,205 --> 00:32:38,373
Okay. Um…

643
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:39,832
I just…

644
00:32:41,376 --> 00:32:42,627
Yeah, go ahead.

645
00:32:43,169 --> 00:32:44,629
I wanted to say that, um…

646
00:32:48,216 --> 00:32:49,717
I know what you mean about Michaela.

647
00:32:50,385 --> 00:32:51,344
You know?

648
00:32:51,427 --> 00:32:54,055
And that you look good,
and you seem well here, so,

649
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:56,265
she's good for you.

650
00:32:57,976 --> 00:32:58,977
And I'm sorry.

651
00:33:01,020 --> 00:33:02,230
Is this a trick, or…

652
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,774
No! Your friends are my friends.

653
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,443
I want to embrace Michaela and Ethan,

654
00:33:07,527 --> 00:33:09,779
and all of us are gonna have
a great weekend together.

655
00:33:10,279 --> 00:33:11,114
Okay.

656
00:33:11,197 --> 00:33:13,116
This is quite a change of heart.

657
00:33:13,199 --> 00:33:14,826
She's a very generous woman,

658
00:33:14,909 --> 00:33:17,453
and I'm very grateful
that she invited me to stay.

659
00:33:17,537 --> 00:33:19,706
I'm so sorry.
I need to steal her for a sec.

660
00:33:20,289 --> 00:33:22,291
Uh, wait, hold on. [sighs]

661
00:33:25,461 --> 00:33:27,964
[man humming]

662
00:33:29,757 --> 00:33:32,176
You're wearing normal clothes.
Do you work for Vanity Fair?

663
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:36,222
[sighs] I do contract work occasionally.
You think this is cream cheese?

664
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:38,307
I don't know. Um, are you a reporter?

665
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,018
Photographer. Why?

666
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:45,356
Okay, if I wanted to, like,
blow the whistle on someone, like…

667
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,609
-How do you mean?
-Uh…

668
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:51,487
Well, I have a story.

669
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,031
[softly] But it's, uh…

670
00:33:53,698 --> 00:33:56,200
it's cult activity and potential murder.

671
00:33:57,618 --> 00:33:58,494
Pass.

672
00:33:59,746 --> 00:34:00,580
Why?

673
00:34:01,831 --> 00:34:04,333
These are bad people. Do you not care?

674
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:07,170
Of course they're bad people.
Look at their house.

675
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:09,714
Does it honestly not bother you
to work for people like this?

676
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:13,634
Ah, well, my kid needs braces,
and my wife wants a farmhouse kitchen.

677
00:34:13,718 --> 00:34:16,763
Well, you're missing out on
the story of a lifetime.

678
00:34:17,263 --> 00:34:18,306
Lifetime.

679
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,976
[guitar strumming]

680
00:34:23,227 --> 00:34:24,687
What are you wearing?

681
00:34:24,771 --> 00:34:27,440
No, the stylist pulled an outfit for you.

682
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,819
-[Peter] I haven't changed yet, my love.
-[Michaela] But the photographer's here.

683
00:34:31,903 --> 00:34:33,237
Can we do this fast?

684
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:36,032
This might be best discussed
with just you and Mr. Kell.

685
00:34:36,115 --> 00:34:37,742
-[Michaela] Why?
-[Peter sighs]

686
00:34:38,868 --> 00:34:41,079
Miss DeWitt, would you give us
a moment, please?

687
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:45,374
I would love a flat white,
if you don't mind grabbing me one.

688
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:47,376
Are you okay, Simone?

689
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,962
[Peter] Hey, can you grab me a scone too?

690
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:50,922
Uh-- Yeah, sure.

691
00:34:51,005 --> 00:34:55,468
Uh, one… flat white
and a scone coming right up.

692
00:34:55,551 --> 00:34:57,637
-Don't use whole milk. He'll bloat.
-Okay.

693
00:34:59,972 --> 00:35:01,307
Are you wearing Crocs?

694
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:04,393
I repeat. I haven't changed yet.

695
00:35:04,477 --> 00:35:07,605
[Michaela] All right, can we do this?
What's up, Jose?

696
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,274
Well, since last night's security breach,

697
00:35:10,358 --> 00:35:12,235
I was reviewing our surveillance feeds,

698
00:35:12,318 --> 00:35:15,238
and I found something
I thought you might want to see.

[monitor chimes]

700
00:35:16,572 --> 00:35:19,075
This is at 12:23 a.m. two nights ago.

701
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:22,537
She's taking a walk.

702
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:25,456
Mmm, fine, but why deactivate the camera?

703
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:27,792
Clearly she doesn't know
I have another angle.

704
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:31,879
She returns at 5:16 a.m.
and reactivates the camera.

705
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:33,131
[camera beeps]

706
00:35:33,714 --> 00:35:35,299
Well, maybe she fell asleep on the beach.

707
00:35:35,383 --> 00:35:37,426
[Jose] Turns out it's a bit of a pattern.

708
00:35:37,510 --> 00:35:39,720
There she is the night before,

709
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:42,682
deactivating at midnight,

710
00:35:43,933 --> 00:35:45,434
reactivating at dawn.

711
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:50,273
She did the same thing
four times last week.

712
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,774
Three times the week before.

713
00:35:51,858 --> 00:35:55,486
Uh, I don't understand.
Where would she be sneaking off to?

714
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,321
The only thing out there is ocean.

715
00:35:57,405 --> 00:35:58,573
And Ethan's house.

716
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,908
-Why would she go to Ethan's house?
-Peter.

717
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:07,123
No. He wouldn't do that, would he?

718
00:36:07,206 --> 00:36:08,124
Oh, yes, he would.

719
00:36:08,207 --> 00:36:11,294
She's just his type,
25 and just here for the summer.

720
00:36:11,377 --> 00:36:13,838
Why do you have such gross friends?

721
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,465
-[Peter] He's your friend too.
-[breathing heavily]

722
00:36:16,549 --> 00:36:19,594
[Michaela] I can't believe it.
She's been lying to my face about this

723
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:21,679
and sneaking around with that dog.

724
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:25,600
-[Peter] Maybe they're in love.
-What?

725
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:28,853
I mean, she's smarter than the models

726
00:36:28,936 --> 00:36:31,063
that he chews up
and spits out every summer.

727
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:32,273
She's sweeter too.

728
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,025
Why aren't you mad?

729
00:36:34,901 --> 00:36:35,735
Be mad.

730
00:36:35,818 --> 00:36:37,778
I'm very mad.

731
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:42,450
She works here.
It's very poor judgment on his part.

732
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,870
I'm just trying to,
you know, understand his POV.

733
00:36:46,871 --> 00:36:48,706
Fine. I'll handle it.

734
00:36:48,789 --> 00:36:51,792

Have you seen, uh, Simone anywhere?

No, I haven't.

[in unison] Hello, Devon.

754

Let me ask you guys something. Um…

What is all this?

You guys are in a…
like, in a group with Michaela?

We're the Folger Glen

Um, and what do you guys preserve?

762
00:38:05,074 --> 00:38:06,659
It's, like, birds?

[Cloe] Mostly raptors.

and transformed us
into a fundraising juggernaut.

766
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:16,294
What she and Peter are doing here
is very special.

767

[in unison] Very special.
It's very meaningful.

00:43:25,227 --> 00:43:27,229
I'm always looking for this bitch.

873
00:43:29,273 --> 00:43:30,107
Simone?

874
00:43:31,191 --> 00:43:32,443
[Patrice] Can I help you?

875
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,112
Oh, hey. Uh…

876
00:43:35,779 --> 00:43:37,323
Hey, buddy. Um…

877
00:43:38,949 --> 00:43:41,410
Have you seen, um, Michaela's assistant?

878
00:43:41,493 --> 00:43:44,496
Uh, I think her name is, uh, Simone?

879
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,373
-[Simone exhales sharply]
-[Patrice] Nope.

880
00:43:46,999 --> 00:43:48,208
[Ethan] Okay, thanks.

881
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:50,294
[music intensifies]

882
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:51,629
[knocking on door]

883
00:43:53,047 --> 00:43:55,466
[suspenseful music playing]

884
00:44:31,377 --> 00:44:33,128
-Damn it, Simone.
-[drawer closes]

885
00:44:38,133 --> 00:44:40,135
[indistinct chatter]

886
00:44:44,223 --> 00:44:46,392
[Devon] Hey, Morgan! Morgan!

887
00:44:47,768 --> 00:44:48,852
[exhales sharply]

888
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:55,401
[groaning]

889
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:57,152
Morgan!

890
00:44:57,903 --> 00:44:59,488
-Hey.
-Hey.

891
00:44:59,571 --> 00:45:00,906
I, uh, brought your phone.

892
00:45:00,989 --> 00:45:03,158
Whoa. What happened to you?

893
00:45:03,242 --> 00:45:05,828
-[sighs] I know, I'm hideous.
-I charged it for you.

894
00:45:05,911 --> 00:45:07,371
[sighs] You're a saint.

895
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:11,250
You sure get a lot of calls from Raymond,
whoever that is.

896
00:45:12,584 --> 00:45:13,919
-Who is he?
-Uh…

897
00:45:14,002 --> 00:45:15,796
-Uh, my boss.
-Oh.

898
00:45:16,463 --> 00:45:20,008
It was, uh, really nice
hanging out with you last night.

899
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:23,721
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

900
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:24,847
[chuckles]

901
00:45:24,930 --> 00:45:28,726
So what's with the Stepford wife dress?
Can't beat 'em, join 'em?

902
00:45:28,809 --> 00:45:29,852
No, I'm, uh…

903
00:45:31,645 --> 00:45:33,230
-[whispering] I'm undercover.
-Oh.

904
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:35,399
Should I be whispering?

905
00:45:36,150 --> 00:45:37,651
This bitch kills people.

906
00:45:37,735 --> 00:45:41,196
So I'm pretending to drink the Kool-Aid
so I can bust my sister out of here.

907
00:45:41,280 --> 00:45:42,114
Oh.

908
00:45:42,698 --> 00:45:45,701
Does that mean you're gonna be, uh,
sticking around for a few days?

909
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:47,786
-[phone ringing]
-Oh shit. I really should take this.

910
00:45:47,870 --> 00:45:49,079
Sure. Sure.

911
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:51,165
-Would you want to grab dinner later?
-It's my boss.

912
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:52,082
[phone chimes]

913
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:54,001
Hey, fuckboy.

914
00:45:56,295 --> 00:45:59,089
[harp and oboe playing]

915
00:46:11,769 --> 00:46:13,353
[Joel sobbing]

916
00:46:13,437 --> 00:46:15,647
Jose, where is Simone?

917
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:18,400
-She has the eulogy on her phone.
-Uh…

918
00:46:18,484 --> 00:46:19,318
Go find her.

919
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,195
Please and thank you, Jose.

920
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:22,821
My pleasure, Peter.

921
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:28,202
[exhales deeply]

922
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,385
[Michaela] Thank you for
being here tonight to remember Barnaby.

923
00:46:45,469 --> 00:46:46,970
[Devon's dad] It tastes like cardboard.

924
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:49,097
-[Ray] My falafels are fantastic.
-Falafel garbage.

925
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:50,474
[Ray] Devon. Devon.

926
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:52,893
-Are you even listening to me?
-[Devon] Yeah.

927
00:46:52,976 --> 00:46:54,937
Where the hell did everybody go?

928
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:57,397
-[Ray] Devon.
-Sorry. Uh, say it… say it again.

929
00:46:57,481 --> 00:46:59,525
No fucking way!

930
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:02,861
[sighs] It's just for the weekend, Ray.
I'm gonna be back Tuesday. I promise.

931
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:06,281
-No, I'm not--
-This asshole bought light beer.

932
00:47:06,365 --> 00:47:08,367
[Ray] I'm not taking care of
your dad until Tuesday.

933
00:47:08,450 --> 00:47:09,785
-Light beer!
-I've got a life!

934
00:47:09,868 --> 00:47:10,869
No, he…

935
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,663
-[Ray] No!
-[Devon's dad] Light beer!

936
00:47:13,622 --> 00:47:15,874
Uh, he's… he's fine during the day.

937
00:47:15,958 --> 00:47:18,085
You just have to do mornings and evenings.

938
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:19,002
[Ray] No!

939
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:21,839
No, Devon.
I refuse to take care of your grumpy dad

940
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:24,883
while you play dress-up
on paradise island, okay?

941
00:47:24,967 --> 00:47:26,510
And do not say you're gonna call Allie,

942
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:29,304
because I refuse to believe
that you'd destroy my life like that.

943
00:47:29,388 --> 00:47:30,848
You're not that crazy.

944
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,475
-Oh, you don't know crazy.
-[Ray] I do know crazy.

945
00:47:33,559 --> 00:47:36,186
It's staring at me right now.
Bruce, you put that down.

946
00:47:36,270 --> 00:47:37,521
-[Bruce] No.
-[Devon] Uh--

947
00:47:37,604 --> 00:47:40,107
Your dad's threatening me
with the poker thing from the fireplace.

948
00:47:40,190 --> 00:47:43,527
Okay, no, he's just confused who you are.
Daddy, that's Ray. Remember Ray?

949
00:47:43,610 --> 00:47:45,112
[Ray] Come on, man. You know me. Ray.

950
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,781
-I was prom king, man. You remember that.
-[groans] Shit.

951
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:48,866
-[phone chimes]
-[groans]

952
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,951
[suspenseful music playing]

953
00:47:55,247 --> 00:47:58,083
[Michaela]
If something seized my life tonight

954
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:02,129
If a sudden wind swept through me
Changing everything

955
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,839
I would not resist

956
00:48:05,883 --> 00:48:08,510
I am ready for whatever comes

957
00:48:10,053 --> 00:48:12,139
But I think it will be something small

958
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,934
An animal padding out from the shadows

959
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:22,190
Or a word spoken so softly
I hear it inside

960
00:48:23,609 --> 00:48:25,652
It is dark out here, and cold

961
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:28,655
The moon is stone

962
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:31,783
I am alone with my longing

963
00:48:32,784 --> 00:48:34,661
Nothing is happening

964
00:48:36,997 --> 00:48:38,373
But the next breath

965
00:48:39,041 --> 00:48:40,208
[guests murmuring]

966
00:48:41,293 --> 00:48:42,419
[exhales shakily]

967
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:45,923
Hey hey.

968
00:48:46,423 --> 00:48:47,507
[guests] Hey hey.

969
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:50,010
[harp and oboe playing]

970
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:55,933
You okay?

971
00:48:58,435 --> 00:48:59,645
[speaking indistinctly]

972
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,481
[Michaela] Thank you so much for coming.

973
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,441
It was just so sudden.

974
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:14,409
Beautiful service, Mickeroo.

975
00:49:14,493 --> 00:49:15,369
-Really.
-Thank you.

976
00:49:15,452 --> 00:49:17,454
So lovely that you spoke from the heart.

977
00:49:17,537 --> 00:49:19,164
It was really lovely, honey.

978
00:49:19,247 --> 00:49:21,792
Stirred up so much emotion in me.

979
00:49:22,334 --> 00:49:23,794
Need to walk it off.

980
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,087
Ethan,

981
00:49:26,254 --> 00:49:27,839
would you go with me to the cliff?

982
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:31,301
Yeah. It would be my honor, Mickeroo.

983
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:34,262
-Can I bring my cookie?
-Of course.

984
00:49:34,346 --> 00:49:36,348

Jesus. [sighs]

989
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:06,128
Oh Christ, Jose,
you have to stop doing that to me.

990
00:50:06,211 --> 00:50:07,421
Come with me. Right now.

991
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:08,505
Come. Come on.

992
00:50:09,631 --> 00:50:11,967
[somber music playing]

993
00:50:12,718 --> 00:50:15,262
[Simone hyperventilating]

994
00:50:15,345 --> 00:50:16,888
-What happened?
-I found her like this.

995
00:50:16,972 --> 00:50:20,559
-Do you want me to call an ambulance?
-No, it's okay. I got it. Thank you.

996
00:50:20,642 --> 00:50:21,560
Simone.

997
00:50:22,144 --> 00:50:23,854
Simone, it's me. I'm right here.

998
00:50:24,354 --> 00:50:25,272
-[sobbing]
-It's okay.

999
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:26,690
Shh. You're okay.

1000
00:50:30,569 --> 00:50:32,237
Come here. It's okay.

1001
00:50:32,738 --> 00:50:34,990
I got you. You're okay.

1002
00:50:35,073 --> 00:50:37,284
[sobbing continues]

1003
00:50:38,493 --> 00:50:39,578
[Devon shushing]
