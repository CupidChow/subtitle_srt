1
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,730
The serial killing shaking the public, known as The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

2
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:09,700
May 5th, when a new crime was predicted,

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:15,100
I encountered a person who seemed to be the suspect and barely escaped death.

4
00:00:15,650 --> 00:00:17,950
Makoto! It's me, Makoto!

5
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:19,200
In such an extreme emergency,

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:20,880
I'm asking what you were doing!

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,030
Don't take the scoop she risked her life to get!

8
00:00:24,050 --> 00:00:26,300
When nobody can remain calm,

9
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:28,350
the eyes of suspicion turning toward him...

10
00:00:28,450 --> 00:00:33,400
Does that mean that the suspect stabbed another woman with blood type A before slashing you?

11
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,250
Unfortunately, there's a high possibility that the 5th crime has already been committed.

12
00:00:38,380 --> 00:00:40,480
I'll protect you.

13
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,080
His true identity, gentle and warm, that only I know...

14
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,300
It's Hiroki who is the most dangerous ex I've ever had.

15
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:51,750
The 5th crime had happened after all.

16
00:00:51,950 --> 00:00:54,850
Could this be an injection mark?

17
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:56,030
An injection mark?

18
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:02,000
The person who doesn't know the truth... maybe me.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,550
Wow, he is here already.

20
00:01:28,550 --> 00:01:29,930
It's too early.

21
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:42,400
Matsuoka, are you sure this is the 5th incident of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident?

22
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:48,000
What's wrong?

23
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,630
Hey, what's going on?

24
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:55,130
You smell good. It's soap.

25
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:59,800
Are you hitting on me?

26
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:06,600
You have high self-confidence.

27
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,800
I think so. The details will be investigated from now on.

28
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,600
Have they found new evidence?

29
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,550
That's yet to come.

30
00:02:16,600 --> 00:02:20,800
If the DNA from Tsutsui Makoto's wound matches the DNA of this victim...

31
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:24,280
I said we’d investigate that from now on.

32
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:28,830
Please let me know if you find out anything.

33
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:33,950
Thank you for your hard work.

34
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:35,080
You're already here.

35
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,230
This is the 5th incident, after all.

36
00:02:40,330 --> 00:02:41,800
Please let me know later if the police lecture about this incident.

37
00:02:42,330 --> 00:02:44,850
What? Are you leaving already?

38
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:47,430
Hey, Tsutsui,

39
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,430
Ah, Mihashi,

40
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:56,930
I always share info with you, but when you got a scoop, you keep it all to yourself?

41
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,380
That's not true.

42
00:02:58,500 --> 00:02:59,950
Then, why didn't you answer my call?

43
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,180
The 5th victim is Kanbe Kyoko, 42, working at an advertising agency.

44
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:11,400
Kanbe lives alone and was believed to be killed between 8 pm and 9 pm on May 5th.

45
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:19,400
Based on the scene and the method of the crime, it has been concluded that this is the 5th incident of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

46
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:23,030
This is the place where Kanbe was killed.

47
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:30,050
And this is the spot where Reporter Tsutsui was attacked by a suspicious person after 9 pm on the same day.

48
00:03:30,630 --> 00:03:32,230
They're very close to each other.

49
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:39,180
Yes, and the DNA detected on my clothes and the wound...

50
00:03:39,930 --> 00:03:44,500
The forensic analysis confirmed that it matched Kobe Kyoko's DNA.

51
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,350
Based on this fact, it has been confirmed that a suspicious person who attacked me is the suspect of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

52
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:58,730
Okay! It's our exclusive scoop! A viewer rating will skyrocket!

53
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,330
That's inappropriate.

54
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:16,450
Since the length from my wrist to my elbow is 23 cm, I believe the suspect must be at least 175 cm tall.

55
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:18,680
That's a bit of a roundabout way of saying it.

56
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,980
Wait, it's fine. You should proceed with caution.

57
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,250
The suspect looks like a man.

58
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,080
I can't say for certain, but I also think the suspect is a man.

59
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,750
Good job. It's better not to jump to conclusions quickly.

60
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:35,100
Being tall doesn't mean they're men, right?

61
00:04:35,250 --> 00:04:38,030
That's a compliance issue, right?

62
00:04:41,380 --> 00:04:43,880
Noda was way too excited.

63
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:47,730
Because your show has a lot more info than the other shows.

64
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:52,550
But even though it's an exclusive scoop, there still aren't many clues about the suspect.

65
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,800
How's your wound? Does it still hurt?

66
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:59,130
No, it's healing nicely.

67
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:00,600
I'm glad to hear that.

68
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:04,680
I'm fine.

69
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:08,380
Because we can't hold hands.

70
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:14,680
You don't have to walk me home every day.

71
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:17,680
I know you're happy, right?

72
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:19,600
Something like that.

73
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:25,900
Makoto, you're the only witness, and you were actually attacked by the suspect.

74
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:28,730
That's true, but...

75
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,900
The suspect knows who you are.

76
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:32,050
But..

77
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:35,680
Since your place and my place are in a straight line, so it's not a big deal.

78
00:05:38,650 --> 00:05:39,780
Wait a second.

79
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:42,080
I don't know where your place is located.

80
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:46,680
Have you finally noticed?

81
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,630
You don't intend to invite me to your house, and moreover, you don't intend to tell me your address, right?

82
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:52,150
My place is small and messy.

83
00:05:52,350 --> 00:05:54,350
I'm talking about the address!

84
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:56,650
I'll tell you that one day...When I moved to the big house!

85
00:06:01,530 --> 00:06:06,450
Fine, I'll tell you my address...Next month.

86
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:12,500
I'm just kidding. I'll tell you it once I clean my place up.

87
00:06:12,550 --> 00:06:13,900
Don't follow me!

88
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:15,400
Come on!

89
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,450
I'll go home by myself!
Why are you laughing?

90
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:21,080
What? Don't you have time to come to my place today?

91
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,380
I have to finish the manuscript by the end of today.

92
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:29,450
I see, good luck. See you.

93
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,550
You can go now.
You first.

94
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,700
Everybody tells lies.

95
00:06:56,180 --> 00:07:07,530
The lies I've built up to stay with you will eventually hurt you one day.

96
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:24,500
If I could rewind time,...where should I start over from?

97
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:31,800
Koi wa Yami (Love is Darkness)

98
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,130
What the hell is this?

99
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,750
The suspect's knife, gloves, and the sneakers were identified!

100
00:07:37,230 --> 00:07:39,080
We identified the suspect's weapon and gloves.

101
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:39,750
Show me!

102
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:44,350
Damn it, it's matched...

103
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:49,180
Episode 5

104
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:46,580
What's going on?

105
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:52,500
The suspect's knife, gloves, and the sneakers were identified!
By Sagara Hiroki

106
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,730
He beat us to it again.

107
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,080
What the hell is he?

108
00:08:02,950 --> 00:08:05,530
How is he able to know such things?

109
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,730
The police haven't even made an announcement.

110
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:11,400
He must have analyzed them from the footage Makoto filmed, right?

111
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:14,700
I wonder if a freelance journalist is even capable of that kind of thing.

112
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:18,730
Well, they usually have wide networks.

113
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:23,550
Oh no, Shitara is wearing the same sneakers as the suspect!

114
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:27,200
It says that he was also questioned by the police last month.

115
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,730
Makoto, did you know that?

116
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,400
No.

117
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:41,900
I didn't know you had the same sneakers as the suspect.

118
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:46,380
You're not the suspect, right?

119
00:08:47,350 --> 00:08:48,850
What would you do if that were true?

120
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,380
I'll do an exclusive interview with you.

121
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:52,700
I'll kill you if you accept the interview with other sources.

122
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:57,350
I'm scared because you seem like you'd do it seriously.

123
00:08:57,430 --> 00:09:02,350
That's right. I'll do anything for a scoop...Just like you.

124
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:07,200
Here's the reward for last month's scoop prize.

125
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:09,950
Thank you.

126
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:16,500
By the way, what happened to the Rolex watch I gave you?

127
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,380
I'm sorry, I sold it.

128
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:27,050
Well, since it's a gift for you, you can do whatever you want with it.

129
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:32,330
Don't worry, I sold the watch, but the love from you is kept safe.

130
00:09:33,230 --> 00:09:35,400
Your talking skills have gotten worse.

131
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:36,830
That's harsh.

132
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:41,850
However, I pay you well enough, I don't think you have any money problems.

133
00:09:42,280 --> 00:09:43,700
What are you spending so much money on?

134
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:49,630
Ah, a girlfriend?

135
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,830
And you're serious about her, so even those expenses can't be claimed as business expenses?

136
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:58,980
It's a secret.

137
00:10:02,500 --> 00:10:08,250
The identified knife and gloves are quite common and widely available on the market.

138
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,050
So, it hasn't helped narrow down the suspect.

139
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,600
What about Shitara Kanji's trail?

140
00:10:13,080 --> 00:10:17,800
His whereabouts are still unknown, but he was captured on a security camera near the crime scene on the day of the incident.

141
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:22,850
And we've got many more eyewitness reports of a man thought to be Shitara Kanji near the crime scene.

142
00:10:23,130 --> 00:10:24,400
Then, Shitara Kanji is the suspect.

143
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:35,500
By the way, the forensic autopsy found a needle mark on the arm of Kanbe Kyoko, the 5th victim.

144
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:41,880
The arm was slashed to conceal the needle mark.

145
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:50,580
In all 4 previous cases, there was a large slashing near the inner joint of the arm that was different from a defensive wound.

146
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:56,500
Since there was no sign of drugs in the victim's body, I think the suspect may have taken blood from them.

147
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,230
For what?

148
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,750
The suspect may take it home as a trophy.

149
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:05,880
The suspect is a total weirdo.

150
00:11:08,550 --> 00:11:11,250
Could you take a look at this?

151
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:17,680
This is a delivery notice found in the mailbox of Shitara Hiroki.

152
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:22,680
Upon investigation, I found that he ordered syringes.

153
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:29,050
Bingo! The piece came together!

154
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:31,080
The mastermind may be the son, Shitara Hiroki.

155
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,850
How did you get this delivery notice?

156
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:38,150
If it turns out that you conducted an illegal investigation, it'd affect the police's credibility.

157
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:42,830
Let's assume the father and the son are cooperating.

158
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,150
Kanji was captured on camera, and Hiroki bought the syringes.

159
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:49,850
Can you tell me which one is the mastermind?
But...

160
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,850
Capture Shitara Kanji as soon as possible! Dismissed.

161
00:11:54,400 --> 00:11:55,500
Please wait!

162
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:08,950
Moron, it's obvious you'd get rejected if you confront them so directly like that.

163
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:15,980
There's no way the top would shift the investigation from Kanji to Hiroki so easily.

164
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,300
But it's too obvious...

165
00:12:18,380 --> 00:12:24,050
If Hiroki is the suspect of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident, then there's a possibility he was the suspect from 10 years ago.

166
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:29,350
They don't want to admit now that Shitara Kanji was innocent.

167
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:33,180
They want to make Kanji the suspect no matter what.

168
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,600
Even though that's true, it doesn't make sense not to investigate Hiroki in this incident.

169
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:43,750
The suspects who killed more than one person are divided into 2 types, organized and disorganized.

170
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:50,980
Many organized-type suspects who commit well-planned incidents are hedonistic killers.

171
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:57,500
They repeatedly kill people with murder as their sole purpose.

172
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:10,050
It's the pleasure they once experienced. They do that again and again...

173
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:29,000
I'm sorry I made you cook.

174
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,550
It's okay since I wanted to check how sharp the knife was.

175
00:13:36,280 --> 00:13:39,050
You read a difficult book.

176
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:42,950
Don't touch it.

177
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:45,530
Ah, I'm sorry.

178
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,730
Makoto, it's for you.
Thank you.

179
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:09,480
Hasegawa, it's for you.
Thank you.

180
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,030
The investigation of the stabbing incident of a female lawyer in Tachikawa city

181
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:41,130
Hiroki was the first person to discover Shitara Kumiko's body.

182
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,280
He was under suspicion as a suspect during the investigation.

183
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,030
But Hiroki denied it.

184
00:14:47,550 --> 00:14:51,680
The lack of physical evidence such as the murder weapon made the investigation challenging.

185
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:57,050
However, the situation changed dramatically after Kanji, her ex-husband, started to confess.

186
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:02,950
The murder weapon was found exactly as Kanji described, and he was arrested.

187
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,400
Who sent this to me...?

188
00:15:10,150 --> 00:15:12,730
The suspect is the son, Hiroki...

189
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:20,300
2-1-6, Nishikihara, Tachikawa city, Tokyo
Shitara Kumiko

190
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:27,750
Hello, Hiroki. You don't have to come to pick me up today.

191
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:29,450
I have somewhere to go.

192
00:15:30,150 --> 00:15:31,300
Makoto!

193
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:37,800
You're early today.

194
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:41,180
Yes. Are you going to an interview? I'll go with you.

195
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:50,730
Ah, it's fine. Let's go home.
Okay.

196
00:16:14,900 --> 00:16:16,680
Are you making tomato-based pasta?
Yes.

197
00:16:16,730 --> 00:16:18,330
Yeah! It's my favorite food!

198
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,400
Hiroki, you're good at cooking.

199
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:23,980
But I can only make simple dishes.

200
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,580
I do it my own way and roughly.

201
00:16:28,400 --> 00:16:31,930
However, this tomato-based pasta is the only dish from my mom's recipes.

202
00:16:33,980 --> 00:16:37,080
My mom was a busy person, so she didn't cook much.

203
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:39,680
But she occasionally made tomato-based pasta for me.

204
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,530
It was very delicious.

205
00:16:43,850 --> 00:16:45,130
I wonder why it was so tasty.

206
00:16:46,430 --> 00:16:47,630
Makoto, prepare the plates.

207
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,400
Makoto?

208
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:04,080
Ah...Something is different.

209
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:13,480
It's tasty.

210
00:17:13,730 --> 00:17:17,100
Something is different. Why's that?

211
00:17:19,080 --> 00:17:22,650
Hiroki, I'll do my best.

212
00:17:23,650 --> 00:17:24,850
What? What happened all of a sudden?

213
00:17:25,230 --> 00:17:30,130
From tomorrow, I'll be fully active and find the suspect.

214
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:37,100
Let's eat!
Wait, I should add something.

215
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,900
That's fine. It's tasty.

216
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,930
I may add soy sauce...

217
00:17:41,050 --> 00:17:44,200
Stop, don't do that. If you make a mistake, there's no way to redo it.

218
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:47,030
But I should add something...

219
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:40,480
Ah, what? Are you Hiroki?

220
00:18:41,250 --> 00:18:42,780
Ah, hello.

221
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:44,100
What are you doing here?

222
00:18:44,950 --> 00:18:47,150
I'm here for an interview.

223
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:49,730
I see.

224
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:57,380
Are you okay if someone sees us together?

225
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,050
No problem.

226
00:19:00,950 --> 00:19:03,650
I'm the one who invited you.
I see.

227
00:19:04,280 --> 00:19:06,680
Makoto is too considerate.

228
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:11,630
And Masakiyo doesn't see me unless I'm with Makoto.

229
00:19:12,530 --> 00:19:15,650
Well, because he may have no reason to meet me alone.

230
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,680
You love him, don't you?

231
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:24,100
But he loves Makoto.

232
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:26,430
It's obvious, right?

233
00:19:26,550 --> 00:19:30,480
It's a complicated love triangle.
It's a love quadrangle.

234
00:19:31,430 --> 00:19:33,600
I see. I'm involved too, right?

235
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:40,650
They're both insensitive.

236
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:48,380
So, the relationship between Masakiyo and me has always been just friends.

237
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,200
It's comfortable, but to be honest, I want to get out.

238
00:19:55,430 --> 00:19:58,100
Makoto told me that you take her home every day after work.

239
00:20:00,030 --> 00:20:01,750
I can't hide anything.

240
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:03,380
Yes, so be careful.

241
00:20:06,380 --> 00:20:08,650
I'm glad Makoto is fine.

242
00:20:13,530 --> 00:20:20,900
She is the one who can push herself to work despite her fear, even after experiencing that.

243
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,780
I think when she says she is fine, it's not just pretending to be strong.

244
00:20:28,950 --> 00:20:30,530
Makoto never be discouraged.

245
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:33,280
What do you mean?

246
00:20:38,800 --> 00:20:44,000
Generally, once we get hurt, the wounds never fully heal.

247
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,180
No matter how much time passes, the things you've experienced once never disappear.

248
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,950
It may fade, but it can never be completely gone.

249
00:21:05,200 --> 00:21:09,780
That experience chases me endlessly like a shadow.

250
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,000
I want the suspect to experience the same thing.

251
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:25,580
Even though they atone for their crimes, they can never truly start over.

252
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,550
I wish they lived forever haunted by the sins they committed.

253
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,080
I'm sorry for talking about such a dark topic.

254
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,600
That's fine. I think so too.

255
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:52,550
I'm not the right man for Makoto.

256
00:21:55,550 --> 00:21:58,800
But I've decided to protect her.

257
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:06,480
Aoi, why don't you try asking him out on a date?

258
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:11,950
I won't let him have Makoto, no matter how much he loves her.

259
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,950
What the hell? I wish somebody would say that to me even though it's just once.

260
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:24,230
Tsutsui Makoto
I've been looking for footage of the suspect from security cameras,
but there's no luck so far.

261
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:26,580
Speaking of the devil?

262
00:22:28,030 --> 00:22:30,180
She is looking for footage of the suspect.

263
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:32,250
I should join her.

264
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:35,700
Thank you for a coffee.
You're welcome.

265
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:37,400
See you.

266
00:22:47,030 --> 00:22:52,550
Damn it. There're security cameras everywhere in town, but why can't I find the suspect on any of them?

267
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,850
I think the police have already collected most of them. So, it's not easy.

268
00:22:58,780 --> 00:23:01,180
If I had captured the suspect's face more clearly at that time...

269
00:23:03,730 --> 00:23:05,750
You never be discouraged...

270
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,050
Thank you.

271
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,200
Would you like to check this camera?

272
00:23:16,450 --> 00:23:17,480
Excuse me.

273
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:20,930
I'm from JBC TV.

274
00:23:23,030 --> 00:23:24,000
Assault?

275
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:31,480
Yes, the suspect arrested for theft claims that he was assaulted by Shitara Hiroki in Ushigome-Yanagi cho.

276
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:36,300
Arrest him before me! Leave me alone!

277
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:45,030
He was suddenly dragged into a back alley and had his neck injured with a knife by Shitara Hiroki.

278
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:47,950
This may be it.

279
00:23:52,850 --> 00:23:55,380
If his testimony is true, we can take Shitara Hiroki here voluntarily.

280
00:23:55,850 --> 00:23:57,880
Just voluntarily...

281
00:23:59,080 --> 00:24:00,180
Ah, it's them.

282
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:12,330
We can't tell if he has a knife from this angle.
Damn it...

283
00:24:21,030 --> 00:24:25,050
I see, so that's how it is...

284
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:38,550
No luck. There's nothing on the video.

285
00:24:44,700 --> 00:24:45,580
What?

286
00:24:45,930 --> 00:24:51,430
I saw something...Here!

287
00:24:53,630 --> 00:24:56,100
This is...
Yes.

288
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,900
What's your relationship with this man?

289
00:25:11,680 --> 00:25:13,430
He is the one whom I interviewed in the past.

290
00:25:14,030 --> 00:25:16,330
He was a member of a special fraud group.

291
00:25:16,730 --> 00:25:19,200
I chased him and wrote an article about him, and it seems that he has held a grudge against me.

292
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:22,130
Charge
Fraud

293
00:25:21,130 --> 00:25:23,750
It seems that he's been wandering around me since he was released.

294
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:27,050
But since I have a lot of enemies like that, I didn't know who he was at first.

295
00:25:28,150 --> 00:25:29,650
I think you're very smart.

296
00:25:30,330 --> 00:25:32,550
Because you understand the camera angles.

297
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:35,900
In this shot, you seem to have a knife.

298
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:40,030
Give me a break, I didn't have a knife.

299
00:25:41,350 --> 00:25:43,350
But I was panicked at that moment.

300
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:50,550
I don't care if he attacks me, but he was targeting her.

301
00:25:51,980 --> 00:25:54,730
Are you talking about Tsutsui Makoto?

302
00:25:55,330 --> 00:26:00,200
Yes. I noticed a suspicious man following her on this main street.

303
00:26:00,500 --> 00:26:01,630
And this happened.

304
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:08,500
I think he tried to attack Makoto to get revenge on me.

305
00:26:10,350 --> 00:26:14,000
Are you saying you did this to protect her?
Yes.

306
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:19,650
By the way, have you seen your father recently?

307
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,850
Ah, the police are keeping an eye on him, right?

308
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:27,250
I'm also looking for him.

309
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,130
Makoto.

310
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,150
Where's Hiroki?

311
00:26:34,780 --> 00:26:36,000
He'll be out soon.

312
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:36,980
What's going on?

313
00:26:37,830 --> 00:26:39,250
I can't say anything.

314
00:26:41,830 --> 00:26:47,530
Makoto, where were you and what were you doing around 7 pm on April 26th?

315
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:54,630
Interview @ Ushigome-Yanagi cho
2 pm - 8:30 pm

316
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,800
Ah, I was doing an interview in Ushigome-Yanagi cho at that time.

317
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:58,280
I was handing out flyers and keeping an eye out for any suspicious people.

318
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:02,330
I see, he was telling the truth...

319
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:03,630
What's going on?

320
00:27:03,730 --> 00:27:05,700
Nothing. See you.

321
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,930
Wait.

322
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:14,830
Do you think Hiroki may be the suspect of the incident from 10 years ago and now?

323
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:18,900
How did you know that?
Was that why you sent me those materials?

324
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:21,130
Those materials?

325
00:27:23,530 --> 00:27:24,530
Nothing.

326
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,280
This is the security camera footage from the night of the incident on May 5th.

327
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:43,500
I believe the person in the footage is Itsuki.

328
00:27:55,780 --> 00:27:59,050
Ah, this is me!

329
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:04,480
Amazing! I'm impressed that you found me in such a brief moment.

330
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:09,250
Just to confirm, what were you doing here?

331
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:11,880
I was doing deliveries.

332
00:28:13,350 --> 00:28:18,880
Well, the order came in at 7:58 pm, and it was delivered by 8:45 pm. Check this.

333
00:28:35,950 --> 00:28:36,700
Here?

334
00:28:38,300 --> 00:28:42,630
I'm sorry for asking you to come here. You must be surprised.

335
00:28:42,950 --> 00:28:46,400
Don't worry, I'm excited. I feel like I'm in the detective drama.

336
00:28:47,630 --> 00:28:52,380
But it's a tough job to do deliveries in that heavy rain.

337
00:28:52,800 --> 00:28:55,630
You should take a day off on days like that to avoid getting injured.

338
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:57,030
You're too overprotective.

339
00:28:57,130 --> 00:28:58,830
Am I?

340
00:28:58,930 --> 00:29:01,700
People order deliveries, especially on rainy days.

341
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:06,330
You're such a nice man. I'll give you candies!

342
00:29:07,030 --> 00:29:10,200
Damn it, I don't have any! Sorry.

343
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:12,250
I gave you the last candy!

344
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,730
It's his fault.
Don't worry.

345
00:29:16,150 --> 00:29:21,100
I now know the police actually do conduct interrogations.

346
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,500
It was a questioning.

347
00:29:22,800 --> 00:29:24,480
Itsuki, wait!

348
00:29:24,950 --> 00:29:26,600
Please take this!

349
00:29:28,180 --> 00:29:31,480
Rice balls. You may be hungry later.

350
00:29:55,350 --> 00:29:56,430
Are you all right?

351
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:02,450
I don't think Itsuki is the suspect.

352
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:07,100
He must have been doing deliveries. I feel guilty.

353
00:30:07,930 --> 00:30:10,830
However, we must check all possibilities.

354
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:14,930
You shouldn't have any preconceived ideas, no matter who the person is.

355
00:30:22,500 --> 00:30:23,850
So, what happened?

356
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,280
Ah, somebody I interviewed in the past held a grudge against me.

357
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:31,300
He picked a fight with me the other day.

358
00:30:31,530 --> 00:30:35,400
Again? I told you to reconsider how you interview people.

359
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:38,280
I want to get scoops.

360
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:40,350
That's not a good excuse.

361
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:45,080
Who is it?

362
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,530
This is Tsutsui.

363
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:58,650
I'm Hanamura. Sorry for the sudden interruption.

364
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:00,350
It's fine.

365
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:03,980
We watched your show the other day.

366
00:31:04,530 --> 00:31:06,000
Ah, thank you.

367
00:31:08,300 --> 00:31:11,000
Are you okay?

368
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:13,630
I'm totally fine now.

369
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:21,200
I see. I'm glad to hear that.

370
00:31:23,450 --> 00:31:31,480
Well, I'm sorry I couldn't capture the suspect.

371
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:40,900
We're really glad you're safe. Thank you.

372
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:46,500
Thank you for your kind words.

373
00:31:54,030 --> 00:32:03,550
Please feel free to use our interview video if it can be helpful for anything.

374
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:06,780
Are you sure?

375
00:32:09,350 --> 00:32:15,200
I'm sorry I was too emotional at that time.

376
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:18,850
It wasn't your fault at all.

377
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:23,430
Thank you for saying that.

378
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,680
Shitara sent us letters many times as well.

379
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:40,630
He said that he really wanted to express our anger and grief to the suspect.

380
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:48,300
We had lost all motivation to fight.

381
00:32:49,980 --> 00:33:00,750
I felt somewhat relieved knowing there was somebody who continued to hold the anger for us.

382
00:33:05,280 --> 00:33:08,780
We'll contact Shitara again ourselves.

383
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:11,780
Ah, he is here with me.

384
00:33:17,330 --> 00:33:18,830
Shitara speaking.

385
00:33:21,380 --> 00:33:24,480
I'm sorry for bothering you repeatedly.

386
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:30,350
Yes. Thank you.

387
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:38,130
Excuse me.

388
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:45,930
Are you crying again?

389
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,880
No, I'm not.

390
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:52,900
I didn't know you wrote letters to them.

391
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:58,900
Why did you not tell me that? That's why...

392
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:02,500
That's why?

393
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,850
Nothing.

394
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:09,750
Say it!
No.

395
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,780
Are you blushing? You're so cute.

396
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:27,350
I'm not!

397
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:40,000
Listen, I just got questioned by the police.

398
00:34:40,130 --> 00:34:42,800
What? Why?

399
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:46,750
Because...Ah...

400
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:55,930
The other day, that weird forensics guy...

401
00:34:56,630 --> 00:35:04,650
Hey, my ginger pork had 7 g less meat than his.

402
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:11,080
I'll have you banned from here.

403
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,680
That's totally customer harassment, right? And I'm just a delivery worker.

404
00:35:16,230 --> 00:35:18,750
Matsuoka is a weirdo.

405
00:35:19,180 --> 00:35:20,600
He is part of the privileged class.

406
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:22,100
What do you mean?

407
00:35:23,350 --> 00:35:24,350
Please keep in touch.

408
00:35:38,730 --> 00:35:42,630
I'm still working. What's up?

409
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:45,630
I want to ask if you'd like to have dinner with me somewhere tonight.

410
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,950
I see, by the way, are you with Makoto now?

411
00:35:49,780 --> 00:35:50,950
No.

412
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:52,980
She hasn't joined you yet.

413
00:35:53,450 --> 00:35:58,000
I want to go out with you alone...
What do you think about Makoto lately?

414
00:35:59,930 --> 00:36:04,550
Makoto seems to ignore the suspicious things about Hiroki.

415
00:36:05,180 --> 00:36:07,030
I'm worried about her.

416
00:36:08,630 --> 00:36:09,480
Are you jealous?

417
00:36:09,650 --> 00:36:11,830
What? Nothing of the sort.

418
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,300
It's about time you express your feelings to her.

419
00:36:15,580 --> 00:36:17,930
If you don't express your feelings to her properly, she'll never notice them.

420
00:36:22,250 --> 00:36:24,680
But I feel like now is the least suitable time for that, more than ever.

421
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:28,750
I guess so, she is only focusing on Hiroki right now.

422
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,200
You don't have to say it so clearly.

423
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,780
I do because I'm not backing you up at all.

424
00:36:34,930 --> 00:36:36,900
You're so harsh.

425
00:36:39,530 --> 00:36:41,130
So, can we go out for dinner tonight?

426
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,380
Sorry, I still have a lot of things to do. Some other time.

427
00:36:46,530 --> 00:36:49,730
Okay, see you.

428
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,150
Did you tell her?

429
00:37:05,100 --> 00:37:08,380
Did you tell her about Hiroki's creepy story?

430
00:37:09,230 --> 00:37:11,550
Not yet.

431
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:19,330
Kinoshita
I got some amazing info

432
00:37:22,330 --> 00:37:27,730
What about it?

433
00:37:27,740 --> 00:37:30,380
There was a needle mark on the body of the 5th victim

434
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:32,680
A needle mark?

435
00:37:33,190 --> 00:37:37,400
The suspect drains blood and keeps it as a trophy

436
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,380
What the hell is that?

437
00:37:47,900 --> 00:37:49,350
Are you sure you pay me this much money?

438
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Yes.

439
00:37:51,950 --> 00:37:58,730
Yes. All you have to do is to keep quiet about the fact that I found that footage first.

440
00:38:05,980 --> 00:38:08,700
Hey, can everybody collect some blood?

441
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,700
Is it easy to collect some blood even though one isn't a medical professional?

442
00:38:14,680 --> 00:38:16,530
Well, if somebody practices...

443
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:19,830
But in principle, everybody shouldn't do that.

444
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:25,000
What's wrong all of a sudden?

445
00:38:25,530 --> 00:38:26,980
Ah, it's something work-related.

446
00:38:33,750 --> 00:38:35,050
Listen, Makoto,

447
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:40,980
What's wrong? You scared me.

448
00:38:42,050 --> 00:38:47,250
More than 10 years ago, Hiroki worked part-time as a security guard at this hospital.

449
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,100
So, we started dating.

450
00:38:51,580 --> 00:38:57,480
At that time, I was still a new nurse, so I practiced collecting blood on him at home.

451
00:38:58,150 --> 00:39:00,780
Then, he said he wanted to try collecting blood himself.

452
00:39:01,130 --> 00:39:04,750
So, I taught him how to do it, and he started practicing seriously.

453
00:39:05,130 --> 00:39:08,980
He kept practicing on me again and again until he became good at it.

454
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,550
As a result, my arms were full of bruises.

455
00:39:16,650 --> 00:39:17,730
It's weird, right?

456
00:39:18,880 --> 00:39:22,930
Since he was my type, I tried not to think too much about it,

457
00:39:23,780 --> 00:39:26,080
but thinking about it now, he was a dangerous man.

458
00:39:29,030 --> 00:39:30,380
You're his girlfriend, right?

459
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:37,880
It may be none of my business, but getting involved with him may be dangerous.

460
00:39:41,730 --> 00:39:43,350
Why did you break up with him?

461
00:39:44,230 --> 00:39:46,300
Because he was suddenly unreachable.

462
00:39:46,950 --> 00:39:50,450
He quit his part-time job, and I didn't know his address, so our relationship just faded away.

463
00:39:52,430 --> 00:39:57,000
But after that, he became the No.1 host in Kabuki cho.

464
00:39:57,650 --> 00:39:58,680
A host?

465
00:40:04,630 --> 00:40:07,780
I'm sorry. You must be shocked.

466
00:40:13,030 --> 00:40:17,050
I think Hiroki cares about you very much.

467
00:40:19,100 --> 00:40:23,530
However, you're a very important person to me, too.

468
00:40:27,980 --> 00:40:30,280
Hiroki is a reliable man, right?

469
00:40:36,380 --> 00:40:39,980
Please don't tell this to anybody, especially Masakiyo.

470
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,680
See you.

471
00:40:49,450 --> 00:40:52,430
Ah, Hikaru?
Hikaru?

472
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,030
I remember him. He was desperate.

473
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,230
What do you mean?

474
00:40:57,330 --> 00:40:58,980
He was obsessed with money.

475
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:05,000
He stole clients from senior hosts without hesitation. He was fearless.

476
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,730
I warned him that such behavior is taboo in this world and would eventually be killed.

477
00:41:11,100 --> 00:41:13,130
How long had he been working here?

478
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:15,650
It was less than a year.

479
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:17,700
He suddenly stopped showing up at work.

480
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,880
I heard that Odaka from Weekly Shinryu picked him up.

481
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,750
Do you know any customers who were close to him?

482
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:31,730
Ah, I remember him. He was a nice man.

483
00:41:32,180 --> 00:41:34,880
He was thoughtful and had a good sense of humor.

484
00:41:35,680 --> 00:41:37,950
I spent a lot of money on him.

485
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:45,280
But when I became his regular customer, he asked me for blood.

486
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,780
At first, I thought it was a joke.

487
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,330
But he brought out something that looked like a blood-collecting set.

488
00:41:52,930 --> 00:42:02,280
Because of my job, I've been dealing with various people, but that was scary.

489
00:42:04,300 --> 00:42:05,500
I was horrified.

490
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,900
Please wait a moment.

491
00:42:21,200 --> 00:42:23,930
Thank you for your hard work.

492
00:42:24,050 --> 00:42:27,100
Chief, was there any new info?

493
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:30,150
Nothing. Sorry.

494
00:42:30,650 --> 00:42:32,180
Me neither.

495
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,600
My only info today was that the victim was a bully in the past.

496
00:42:36,350 --> 00:42:37,580
When was that?

497
00:42:37,750 --> 00:42:39,080
When she was a junior high school student.

498
00:42:39,850 --> 00:42:44,680
There was a former classmate who held a grudge against her, and she made me listen to her bullying story for an hour.

499
00:42:44,850 --> 00:42:47,230
She really wants me to broadcast her story.

500
00:42:47,850 --> 00:42:52,030
It'd be better if that had happened a few years ago, but that woman is already 42 years old.

501
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:56,480
It's pointless to bring up an issue from almost 30 years ago now.

502
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:58,580
This issue has nothing to do with The Eye of Horus Murder Incident, right?

503
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:02,780
Really? We don't know whether it's related or not.

504
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:09,030
People can't erase any part of their past.

505
00:43:16,880 --> 00:43:28,330
If a single drop of a foreign substance falls into clear water, no matter how much pure water you add, it'll never return to be clear water.

506
00:43:31,700 --> 00:43:36,080
No matter how nice a person seems, his past sticks to him and won't go away.

507
00:43:37,180 --> 00:43:40,200
Do you think this bully issue has something to do with The Eye of Horus Murder Incident?

508
00:43:40,330 --> 00:43:41,780
I don't agree with you.

509
00:43:44,530 --> 00:43:49,880
The past and the present are different...for sure!

510
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:55,030
Makoto?

511
00:43:59,150 --> 00:44:02,050
I'm sorry. I'll be out for a while.

512
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:11,280
I'm going to stay at the office tonight, so you don't need to pick me up.

513
00:44:12,250 --> 00:44:13,300
Did something happen?

514
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:22,950
A colleague who was supposed to edit the show for tomorrow got sick, so I'll take over her work.

515
00:44:23,930 --> 00:44:26,130
I see. Do your best.

516
00:44:29,280 --> 00:44:32,030
Hiroki, where are you now?

517
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,450
I'm at a cafe editing my article.

518
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:38,000
It'll take a little longer.

519
00:44:39,180 --> 00:44:40,130
I see.

520
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:48,830
Hiroki,

521
00:44:57,030 --> 00:45:00,030
Even for you, it must be hard to stay overnight at the office on such short notice.

522
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:03,880
Maybe it is.

523
00:45:04,280 --> 00:45:06,930
Ah, yes, it's about the other day,

524
00:45:08,430 --> 00:45:13,330
Tomato-based pasta, I remembered that my mom added mayo as a secret ingredient.

525
00:45:14,300 --> 00:45:16,550
It tastes completely different. You'll be surprised.

526
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:19,130
I'll make it tomorrow, so please try it.

527
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:23,230
I'm looking forward to it.

528
00:45:27,750 --> 00:45:30,480
Good night.

529
00:46:17,480 --> 00:46:20,850
I'm his friend. I accidentally left my belongings in his room.

530
00:46:21,130 --> 00:46:24,100
He told me to let you know what happened and ask you to open the door.

531
00:46:26,780 --> 00:46:28,530
If necessary, I can call him and...

532
00:46:28,600 --> 00:46:32,000
You were on TV the other day, right?
Yes.

533
00:46:38,180 --> 00:46:41,480
Yes, that was you. I saw that show.

534
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:43,430
You have a strong sense of justice.

535
00:46:44,500 --> 00:46:45,580
Thank you.

536
00:46:45,730 --> 00:46:49,680
Wait a moment. It's Shitara's place, right?

537
00:47:09,430 --> 00:47:11,730
Please let me know when you're finished.

538
00:47:12,050 --> 00:47:13,630
Thank you.

539
00:49:51,350 --> 00:49:52,530
What are you doing here?

540
00:49:59,900 --> 00:50:14,900
Next episode

541
00:50:00,480 --> 00:50:02,500
After all, it was all lies.

542
00:50:02,580 --> 00:50:04,530
Why can't be analyzed within the police department?

543
00:50:04,580 --> 00:50:06,050
How far have you reached the truth?

544
00:50:06,100 --> 00:50:07,830
Don't do things on your own.

545
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,250
You keep in contact with your father, right?

546
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:10,730
You drive me crazy.

547
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,530
Are you prepared to come to our side?

548
00:50:12,540 --> 00:50:14,900
Somebody will die in episode 6
