1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,000
Hey.

2
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,380
The victim is Assistant Inspector Owada Kayo of the MPD, and...

3
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,750
The Eye of Horus Murder Incident took an unexpected turn with another surprising incident...

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:19,650
All the victims conducted a comprehensive medical checkup within 6 months before the incidents occurred.

5
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,250
She was killed by the suspect because she was getting closer to the truth of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,730
Hiroki has no alibi.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:27,280
I know you're having a doubt, but she truly is my sister.

8
00:00:27,380 --> 00:00:29,380
The truth told by Hiroki, and...

9
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,730
I saw Hiroki in the hospital several times.

10
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:34,500
The facts brought by people other than Hiroki...

11
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:36,450
So, what can you protect by doing that?

12
00:00:36,530 --> 00:00:38,400
Is Hiroki the only one you can see?

13
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:40,650
I'm the only one who can't see it...

14
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:43,450
Noda, please allow me to handle this incident.

15
00:00:41,580 --> 00:00:43,450
New development in The Eye of Horus Murder Incident
Suspicion falls on a famous journalist
Uncover his true face

16
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,150
Are you sure?
Yes.

17
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,430
That's not true. Only I...

18
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:06,630
Thank you in advance.

19
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:10,780
I'm Noda, the executive director. Thank you for working with us today.

20
00:01:11,350 --> 00:01:12,330
I'm Shitara.

21
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:15,600
Please have a seat.

22
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:23,350
Alright, let's get started.

23
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:30,180
You said the other day about The Eye of Horus Murder Incident...

24
00:01:30,250 --> 00:01:35,150
Hiroki requested us not show his face during the interview.

25
00:01:36,350 --> 00:01:37,950
Because he has a lot of enemies.

26
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:41,880
My parents were classmates in college.

27
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:45,650
In exchange for not showing his face, he said we could ask any questions.

28
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,730
That's probably Hiroki's determination.

29
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:51,980
I think I was raised with a lot of love by my mother.

30
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:57,980
However, for me, her love was a little...actually quite overwhelming.

31
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:05,230
I had no idea whether my father was alive or dead for a long time.

32
00:02:05,330 --> 00:02:10,380
When my father was arrested, I was just shocked.

33
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:23,000
I'm here now, after repeatedly asking myself if I could make good use of his determination and how to use it. But...

34
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,080
But I also have happy memories.

35
00:02:32,830 --> 00:02:38,000
When I was little, I went on a trip with my mother to see the cherry blossoms.

36
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,580
That day, my mother was in a good mood.

37
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,750
I was happy to see her smile.

38
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:55,230
But my mother was crying while watching the cherry blossoms.

39
00:02:56,700 --> 00:03:02,730
Hiroki, it's beautiful, isn't it?

40
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:06,780
She said that over and over.

41
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:19,080
I've never been able to understand either my mother's feelings or my father's feelings when he confessed to killing her.

42
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:32,450
What kind of feelings did they have to stay married or as a family?

43
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:43,380
I wonder if I was a part of the family for her.

44
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:07,730
There's a rumor that the police suspect you as the suspect of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

45
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,530
I sometimes feel like I'm being suspected by the police.

46
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:20,600
But if I were the suspect, why would I wait 10 years after my mother's incident to start a series of murders now?

47
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:27,750
Since your father was released from prison, you may have thought that you could blame him.

48
00:04:29,530 --> 00:04:34,900
Indeed, the article I wrote makes it seem like I betrayed my father.

49
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:46,400
We've gathered a lot of testimonies that suggest you could be the suspect.

50
00:04:50,500 --> 00:04:54,500
Aren't you the suspect?

51
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,400
Didn't you kill them?

52
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:08,700
No, I didn't.

53
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,800
Do you suspect your father?

54
00:05:23,250 --> 00:05:28,580
My father isn't the suspect.

55
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:36,750
Makoto, it was an excellent interview. I had goosebumps.

56
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:38,500
I think so too.

57
00:05:39,450 --> 00:05:42,530
I didn't ask him about Mikuru.

58
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,500
Because I thought Hiroki wouldn't answer that.

59
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:49,400
Hey, don't do that!

60
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:56,930
However, there's a big difference between asking and not getting an answer, and not asking at all.

61
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,780
I chose not to ask at all.

62
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:09,530
The start of the rainy season in Tokyo is expected to be around June 6th this year.

63
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:12,850
June 6th

64
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:27,900
Koi wa Yami (Love is Darkness)

65
00:06:31,630 --> 00:06:33,580
Do you suspect your father?

66
00:06:34,980 --> 00:06:38,080
My father isn't the suspect.

67
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:39,850
What the hell is this?

68
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,800
Saki, I'm sorry for doing something without your permission.

69
00:06:45,050 --> 00:06:49,080
Shitara Kanji was just wandering around Ushigomeyanagi-cho before the incident.

70
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:55,050
And his son wrote the article to raise doubts about his father...right?

71
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:55,300
Episode 8

72
00:06:57,630 --> 00:07:03,300
And if we take advantage of the situation and broadcast this interview, it'd cause problems as it'd lead to prejudice against former prisoners, right?

73
00:07:04,350 --> 00:07:07,400
But he clearly denied that his father was the suspect.

74
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,600
What's wrong?

75
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:15,580
Makoto, what do you expect to happen after broadcasting this interview?

76
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:21,980
Since that article was posted, the suspicion toward Shitara Kanji and Hiroki has increased.

77
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:26,400
If this interview is broadcasted, they'll be even more suspected.

78
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:31,830
Do you broadcast this interview based on the belief that Shitara Hiroki is the suspect?

79
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:34,580
Well...

80
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,250
It doesn't matter.

81
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:41,780
I felt that he was talking sincerely.

82
00:07:41,900 --> 00:07:44,550
His eyes told us that he was telling the truth.

83
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,100
His behavior and words were both perfect.

84
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:50,600
I thought he was a 100 times better person than what the public said about him.

85
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,650
However, the outside of him is suspicious.

86
00:07:57,450 --> 00:08:01,280
A deep, suspicious aura wraps around him completely.

87
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,680
It's very interesting.

88
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,230
This is going to be broadcasted. I decided so. Got it?

89
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:17,730
Tsutsui, show me the part where he talks about his mother.

90
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,250
I'd like to make it a bit more emotional.

91
00:08:21,550 --> 00:08:23,680
Tsutsui Makoto
Your interview will be broadcasted tomorrow

92
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:31,850
Odaka.

93
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,080
What happened all of a sudden?

94
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:39,980
I'm sorry. I'll definitely make up for this.

95
00:08:41,950 --> 00:08:45,730
Odaka, you're always my top priority.

96
00:08:46,580 --> 00:08:50,330
However, my top priority doesn't mean just one person.

97
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:52,730
I'll definitely make up for this. See you.

98
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:01,600
Don't tell me...!

99
00:09:03,050 --> 00:09:04,530
Was he interviewed by another company...?

100
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,600
I sometimes feel like I'm being suspected by the police.

101
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:17,180
But if I were the suspect, why would I wait 10 years after my mother's incident to start a series of murders now?

102
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:23,050
He is totally suspicious
He killed them
So, is he the true suspect of his mother's murder incident?

103
00:09:17,930 --> 00:09:22,830
Since your father was released from prison, you may have thought that you could blame him.

104
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:26,950
Indeed, the article I wrote makes it seem like I betrayed my father.

105
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:34,230
We've gathered a lot of testimonies that suggest you could be the suspect.

106
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:36,350
His darkness is too deep
It seems that he is the one who named The Eye of Horus Murder Incident

107
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:38,600
If he is a theatrical criminal, he should have shown his face.

108
00:09:39,250 --> 00:09:42,480
Aren't you the suspect?

109
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:46,480
He kills people to get scoops
He looks like the suspect

110
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,350
Didn't you kill them?

111
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:49,130
No, I didn't.

112
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:56,000
Do you suspect your father?

113
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:04,150
My father isn't the suspect.

114
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:11,430
So, you didn't tell them about me.

115
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,950
No, because they didn't ask me.

116
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:26,980
The show has ended. Thank you for your hard work.

117
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:31,100
Thank you for your hard work.

118
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:42,930
Hey, does your boyfriend have any more secrets? Did you ask him everything?

119
00:10:46,930 --> 00:10:48,050
Thank you for your hard work.

120
00:10:55,080 --> 00:10:56,450
Ah, it's him again.

121
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:09,130
But he didn't show up on May 23rd when Owada was killed.

122
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,650
What is he doing?

123
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:27,500
Damn it, if I had arrested him earlier...Owada didn't die...

124
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,280
Masakiyo,

125
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,830
Ah, sorry.

126
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,550
I'm sorry for making you do overtime.

127
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:45,480
No problem.

128
00:11:45,800 --> 00:11:47,330
Masakiyo, are you still working?

129
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,730
Do you sleep and eat properly? Have you lost weight?

130
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:54,680
I'm fine.

131
00:11:56,750 --> 00:12:02,930
I understand your anxiety, but if you get sick and are taken off the investigation, you'll regret it.

132
00:12:03,930 --> 00:12:05,030
Health should be your top priority!

133
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:09,100
Yes, I'll keep that in mind.
All right.

134
00:12:12,450 --> 00:12:15,480
Please make up with Makoto.

135
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:20,200
See you.

136
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:35,100
The shocking interview on Morning Flash!
Is the journalist the suspect?

137
00:12:38,630 --> 00:12:42,500
I watched his interview, and he is definitely the suspect
If he is innocent, I won't trust Morning Flash anymore
I'm convinced that he is the suspect after re-reading his articles

138
00:12:52,850 --> 00:12:54,130
That greeting is weird.

139
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:58,980
Would you like to drink beer?

140
00:12:59,150 --> 00:12:59,930
Sounds good.

141
00:13:00,450 --> 00:13:02,250
I bought something as well.

142
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:06,700
It was a great deal and only 2 packages were left.

143
00:13:11,050 --> 00:13:12,800
I got the last one.

144
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:17,130
Oh no, what do we do with so much grilled liver?!

145
00:13:17,180 --> 00:13:18,700
Don't worry, we'll finish them all.

146
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:26,480
I'm sorry about the other day.

147
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:34,550
I was worried that you trusted Hiroki so much that you couldn't see anything else.

148
00:13:35,850 --> 00:13:41,880
But I think you're a cautious person, so you wouldn't lose your reason over a romance, right?

149
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:47,980
In that interview, you questioned him thoroughly. It was so like you.

150
00:13:56,630 --> 00:14:00,300
Ah, thank you for the other day.

151
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,650
Thanks to you, it looks like we'll be able to get high ratings.

152
00:14:02,930 --> 00:14:06,200
Thanks to you, too, I became the man of the hour.

153
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:12,550
Once you wrote the article that betrayed your father, and now you say your father isn't the suspect.

154
00:14:12,630 --> 00:14:14,450
I want to make the incident more exciting.

155
00:14:16,330 --> 00:14:19,500
Tsutsui wanted to defend you, so she filmed that interview, right?

156
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:25,150
Whether we interviewed you or not, it was only a matter of time before you became the man of the hour.

157
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:30,300
If that's the case, she wanted to make you tell the truth...something like that?

158
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:36,500
But unfortunately, to most people, I was only seen as a person of suspicion.

159
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:40,830
Makoto may start worrying that her plans have gone wrong.

160
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:44,200
You really understand your subordinate well.

161
00:14:44,780 --> 00:14:48,400
Well, it doesn't matter to me since we could broadcast your interview first.

162
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:51,650
For me, as long as this incident gets attention, that's all I care about anything else.

163
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:58,730
May I ask you something?

164
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:05,080
You said that your father wasn't the suspect, right?

165
00:15:05,830 --> 00:15:08,600
You sounded as if you knew who the suspect was.

166
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:12,400
I think that was just a figure of speech.

167
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,280
I see.

168
00:15:16,830 --> 00:15:18,250
May I ask you something as well?

169
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:19,950
Go ahead.

170
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:24,330
What's your relationship with my father?

171
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:33,200
I'm not his enemy...At least I'm not.

172
00:15:44,350 --> 00:15:46,600
It was the first time we ever fought, right?

173
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:57,730
I'm sorry. I knew you said that because you were worried about me, but...

174
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,400
Am I really losing my reason after all?

175
00:16:06,450 --> 00:16:10,280
I love Masakiyo.

176
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,230
You really are insensitive.

177
00:16:15,430 --> 00:16:16,830
Since when?
Since our 1st year of high school.

178
00:16:19,130 --> 00:16:20,350
I'm insensitive.

179
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:24,330
I tried to interact with him as a friend as much as possible so as not to ruin our friendship.

180
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:29,180
I'm sorry.

181
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:33,230
Why are you apologizing? I'm just avoiding change and settling for a comfortable situation.

182
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:40,080
Because I'm scared...

183
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:51,430
I think loving somebody is wonderful if your feelings are connected, but if not, it can be harmful.

184
00:16:52,730 --> 00:16:53,580
Harmful?

185
00:16:55,280 --> 00:17:03,780
Wanting the other person to unilaterally understand your feelings is no different from my stalker after all.

186
00:17:04,850 --> 00:17:06,300
That's not true.

187
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,550
Masakiyo likes me as a friend, but he doesn't love me as a girlfriend.

188
00:17:15,530 --> 00:17:23,080
In a situation like that, if I confess my feelings to him, I wonder what the difference is between a stalker and me.

189
00:17:24,180 --> 00:17:27,280
I don't know where the line is.

190
00:17:29,630 --> 00:17:30,630
Aoi,

191
00:17:32,130 --> 00:17:37,550
I think when we love somebody, we tend to project our desires onto them.

192
00:17:50,550 --> 00:17:54,580
Don't worry, I'd do anything for you guys.

193
00:17:58,630 --> 00:17:59,600
Mikuru,

194
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,500
Ah, officers, how are you?

195
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:19,030
What's going on? Are you going to give me some more info?

196
00:18:19,850 --> 00:18:22,300
What did you go to the hospital for?

197
00:18:23,430 --> 00:18:26,150
Don't be so rude. Let's start with a greeting.

198
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,980
Answer my question!

199
00:18:28,030 --> 00:18:29,430
Hey, stop it.

200
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,180
I apologize for his rudeness.

201
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:38,150
You're frequently on the security camera footage at this hospital.

202
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:40,950
I was collecting materials.

203
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,200
Don't talk nonsense!

204
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,680
Stop it.

205
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:48,050
You've become more aggressive than before.

206
00:18:48,130 --> 00:18:49,750
Stop fooling around!

207
00:18:49,780 --> 00:18:52,200
All right, I'll tell you.

208
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:01,180
I received info that the common link among all the victims was that they had health checkups at that hospital.

209
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,980
Who said that?

210
00:19:02,000 --> 00:19:05,500
I told you before I couldn't reveal my source. Please remember it by now.

211
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:11,500
So, I wanted to prevent the next crime somehow.

212
00:19:11,750 --> 00:19:16,230
I was warning ladies who share characteristics with the previous victims at the hospital.

213
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:23,400
Did you go to the hospital on May 23rd for the same reason?

214
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:28,450
I didn't go to the hospital that day when Owada was killed.

215
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:32,050
I wasn't on the security camera footage that day, right?

216
00:19:35,850 --> 00:19:39,680
It seems there're no more questions to me...

217
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,580
Excuse me.

218
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:54,630
Owada always stopped you when you lost control, right?

219
00:19:55,250 --> 00:19:58,900
That's enough. You shouldn't bring your personal feelings to the investigation.

220
00:20:20,450 --> 00:20:24,350
Kinoshita, can you show me the predicted area map for The Eye of Horus Murder Incident on June 6th?

221
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,600
Ah, I'm still working on it.

222
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:32,300
I suspect the Hino area.

223
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:34,300
I agree.

224
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:39,200
Makoto, you're off The Eye of Horus Murder Incident team.

225
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:43,680
Can you help the Gourmet section that they're shorthanded?

226
00:20:44,430 --> 00:20:45,430
How come?

227
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:51,600
I don't think someone like you, who has a close relationship with a suspected person, can think logically.

228
00:20:52,180 --> 00:20:53,550
I can do my job properly.

229
00:20:53,830 --> 00:20:55,480
It'll be too late if something happens.

230
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,330
Noda!

231
00:20:58,130 --> 00:20:59,550
Noda also agrees.

232
00:21:01,850 --> 00:21:03,250
This is unacceptable.

233
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,600
Saki, I'm just fine. I won't mix private and public matters.

234
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:10,200
Are you sure?

235
00:21:11,950 --> 00:21:15,880
Well, if Makoto leaves, will I be the only director?

236
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:17,900
I can't do that.

237
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:19,820
Kinoshita...

238
00:21:19,830 --> 00:21:22,130
Experiences are very important.

239
00:21:22,550 --> 00:21:25,680
It's impossible for me to do the same work as my senior from today on.

240
00:21:27,280 --> 00:21:29,080
It'd be better for our show to keep Makoto in our team.

241
00:21:31,030 --> 00:21:32,300
I'll cover for you.

242
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,800
Kinoshita, thank you.

243
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,880
Then, Odaka got upset.

244
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:56,750
I was forced to drink with her until morning. I was completely exhausted for the first time in a while.

245
00:21:57,530 --> 00:21:59,200
She can drink a lot.

246
00:22:02,230 --> 00:22:03,780
Makoto, did something happen?

247
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:06,230
Nothing.

248
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:13,900
Are you worried that I'm being treated like the suspect?

249
00:22:17,380 --> 00:22:18,350
Ah, was I wrong?

250
00:22:19,850 --> 00:22:23,150
I'm sorry, I was too naive.

251
00:22:25,380 --> 00:22:29,480
Originally, it all started with the article I wrote.

252
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:35,950
Moreover, I think the damage has been kept to a minimum because I could express it in my own words on Morning Flash.

253
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:37,950
Thank you.

254
00:22:41,950 --> 00:22:45,400
Hiroki, you should do everything properly.

255
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:50,930
Everybody will suspect you if you don't speak properly.

256
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:53,800
You're suspicious.

257
00:22:55,500 --> 00:22:56,930
You say things without holding back.

258
00:22:59,150 --> 00:23:03,600
I know you have a few things, like Mikuru, that you don't want to talk about.

259
00:23:04,830 --> 00:23:11,150
But please continue to express the things you should discuss properly.

260
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,900
I haven't been told...

261
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:34,680
You haven't told me you love me.

262
00:23:35,930 --> 00:23:37,350
Don't laugh it off!

263
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,700
Makoto, you're a funny lady.

264
00:23:39,730 --> 00:23:42,100
I haven't said anything funny at all!

265
00:23:43,100 --> 00:23:45,280
Ah, Makoto and her boyfriend!

266
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,800
Itsuki,

267
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:53,200
Mr. Boyfriend, I saw your interview.
Thank you.

268
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:54,950
You're amazing.

269
00:23:56,230 --> 00:24:00,050
If my mother were killed, I'd definitely get revenge against the suspect.

270
00:24:01,230 --> 00:24:02,830
You must have a nice mother.

271
00:24:03,580 --> 00:24:07,680
Do you ever think of not wanting to get revenge, even though you're a victim's family member?

272
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:15,030
Could it be that all the victims of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident have something to do with your mother?

273
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:17,280
Itsuki?

274
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:22,830
Maybe you've been killing the victims who were involved in your mother's death one by one for revenge.

275
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:24,930
What happened to you?

276
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:28,650
I'll never forgive the suspect who killed Kayo.

277
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:33,900
Ah, something is on your hair!

278
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:35,930
Ouch!

279
00:24:36,030 --> 00:24:41,180
Okay, I have to go now. See you!

280
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,450
What's wrong with him?

281
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,500
Does this come in handy?

282
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:48,050
How did you get this?

283
00:24:48,230 --> 00:24:50,130
I pretended it was an accident and pulled it out.

284
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,050
Hey, Komine.

285
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:56,730
Yes. I'm sorry, I'll talk to you later.

286
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:58,450
Take this!

287
00:25:09,530 --> 00:25:11,000
It's pork back fat.

288
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:14,700
That's the easiest solution. Soup with pork back fat tends to have a thin flavor.

289
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,480
Then, based on what do you judge whether it's tasty or not?

290
00:25:16,550 --> 00:25:20,280
Makoto, I completed the predicted area map for The Eye of Horus Murder Incident on June 6th.

291
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:21,950
Can you check it?

292
00:25:22,330 --> 00:25:23,930
Makoto, we have to go.

293
00:25:24,130 --> 00:25:27,680
All right. I'm sorry, Kinoshita, can you send it to me?

294
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:29,000
Let's go.

295
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:38,100
This soup is shining. It looks like a diamond.

296
00:25:38,580 --> 00:25:39,900
Please try it now, Oshima.

297
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,600
I'm Kojima. Thank you for the meal.

298
00:25:43,450 --> 00:25:45,900
Kinoshita Harumichi
I sent you a file

299
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:44,850
How does it taste?

300
00:25:44,950 --> 00:25:46,000
I haven't had it yet.

301
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,930
Let me eat first. It looks delicious.

302
00:25:52,180 --> 00:25:53,580
What do you want to talk to me about?

303
00:25:55,430 --> 00:25:57,930
Please don't get involved in Makoto anymore.

304
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,500
I don't trust you.

305
00:26:07,130 --> 00:26:09,200
What are you trying to do to Makoto?

306
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,630
Aoi, you look like Makoto's mother.

307
00:26:14,630 --> 00:26:19,630
A mother tries to keep her daughter's boyfriend, who is an unsavory type, away from her.

308
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:25,980
You pick up and drop off Makoto every day,

309
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:32,550
because you're trying to control her by making her believe that you're the only one who protects her, right?

310
00:26:34,050 --> 00:26:38,850
You're trying to dull her judgment so that nobody's words reach her.

311
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,800
For what?
That's my question.

312
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:47,050
Aoi, you believe I'm the suspect, right?

313
00:26:51,750 --> 00:26:56,130
It's not just me, but everybody thinks so.

314
00:26:58,250 --> 00:26:59,480
Who is "Everybody"?

315
00:27:02,530 --> 00:27:09,530
However, your courage in coming to see somebody whom you think is the suspect alone is genuine.

316
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:19,150
Makoto is a lucky girl...If it's your true self, Aoi.

317
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,350
It looks delicious.

318
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:53,250
After watching ramen all day today, I really wanted to have it.

319
00:27:54,450 --> 00:27:56,580
I should've bought more toppings.

320
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:58,750
All day?

321
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,380
I filmed a gourmet show today.

322
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,150
What about The Eye of Horus Murder Incident?

323
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,780
Natto (fermented soybeans)?
Natto doesn't go with ramen.

324
00:28:11,230 --> 00:28:12,080
Kimchi?

325
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:14,100
That may work.

326
00:28:17,930 --> 00:28:20,700
Haven't you been coming home early lately?
Have I?

327
00:28:23,180 --> 00:28:24,050
Bring chopsticks.

328
00:28:26,350 --> 00:28:27,380
And seaweed.

329
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:31,780
Thank you.

330
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:36,280
Something happened, right?

331
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:41,050
Makoto,

332
00:28:44,680 --> 00:28:46,530
I was taken off The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

333
00:28:48,530 --> 00:28:50,830
But I like having peaceful days.

334
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,630
I'm good at picking up chopsticks for filming.

335
00:28:56,250 --> 00:28:57,080
Let's eat!

336
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,930
Thank you for the meal.

337
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:12,830
Breaking news
Is Shitara Hiroki, the suspicious journalist, really the suspect?

338
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:24,900
Makoto, let's go on a trip!

339
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:33,700
Nice to see you again, my hometown!

340
00:29:33,830 --> 00:29:35,750
Don't get too excited. You look like a little kid.

341
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,830
Ah, it's nostalgic.

342
00:29:40,100 --> 00:29:40,880
Hello.

343
00:29:40,950 --> 00:29:42,300
Hello, welcome.

344
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:44,880
This is a bakery I used to come to often when I was a student.

345
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:50,130
It's very tasty. My No. 1 bakery!

346
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:51,880
Thank you for the meal.

347
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:00,730
It's pretty ordinary...

348
00:30:00,850 --> 00:30:04,980
Thank god, I was hesitating whether I could say the same thing.

349
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,480
But it's tasty.

350
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:09,530
It's strange. Could it be that I remembered it wrong?

351
00:30:10,730 --> 00:30:11,780
You must have been happy.

352
00:30:12,930 --> 00:30:17,130
The reason you thought it was tasty is that your memory of eating this bread with friends was a happy one.

353
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:21,450
You may be right. So, that was why it was my No.1.

354
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,680
Oh no, I'm emotional.
Oh, please.

355
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,450
Hey, did you enjoy my hometown?

356
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,950
I promised to go to your hometown one day, right?

357
00:30:35,980 --> 00:30:37,130
You remembered.

358
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,500
I have an excellent memory.

359
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,880
Your smug face is annoying!

360
00:30:42,980 --> 00:30:45,530
Makoto, watch!

361
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:56,680
Kinoshita, we need more shots. The viewers won't understand it.

362
00:30:56,850 --> 00:30:58,680
I'll take more films later.

363
00:30:58,830 --> 00:31:01,080
Kinoshita, should we include this area in the dangerous zone?

364
00:31:01,230 --> 00:31:02,150
I'll think about it later.

365
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,480
Kinoshita, what equipment do we rent?

366
00:31:04,850 --> 00:31:09,380
Hey, Kinoshita, what's the point of re-examining the 5th incident? It's not interesting at all.

367
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:14,930
Here you are.

368
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,230
Thank you. Wow, it's a lot of food.

369
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:20,050
This is "A perfect set".

370
00:31:23,280 --> 00:31:26,300
Do you think they're a husband and a wife? I like the atmosphere.

371
00:31:26,950 --> 00:31:28,250
Would you like to open the shop?

372
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:32,630
Then, can you get a cooking license? I'll take care of customer service.

373
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,300
It's easy to say.

374
00:31:34,630 --> 00:31:37,730
Ah, but I'm not good at calculations.

375
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,030
Hiroki, can you also get a bookkeeping qualification?

376
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,650
Hey, my burden is too heavy.

377
00:31:44,230 --> 00:31:47,030
It's for our lives. Do your best!

378
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:52,880
It was a fun day.

379
00:31:53,880 --> 00:31:56,600
We've never done a normal date like this before.

380
00:31:58,000 --> 00:31:59,900
Because work is always our priority.

381
00:32:06,280 --> 00:32:07,480
Would you like to live here forever?

382
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,330
That may be a good idea.

383
00:32:15,830 --> 00:32:19,080
Give me a break! I know you're a workaholic.

384
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:26,100
Even though we live here, somebody continues to report the incident.

385
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:32,500
Indeed.

386
00:32:36,030 --> 00:32:37,880
Do you want this?
I do!

387
00:32:38,730 --> 00:32:39,730
It's really tasty.

388
00:32:47,750 --> 00:32:51,200
Is this the place where you used to play often when you were a kid?
Yes.

389
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,950
I see.

390
00:32:56,180 --> 00:33:00,430
I wanted to see the cherry blossoms here when they were in full bloom.

391
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:05,230
I've helped a girl here before.

392
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,580
She was crying furiously. She may have lost.

393
00:33:11,280 --> 00:33:15,330
Hiro,

394
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:20,930
What's wrong? Where's your mother?

395
00:33:26,450 --> 00:33:27,400
Let's play a game!

396
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:36,830
You'll be happy if you can grab 3 petals at once.

397
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:39,080
Let's play.

398
00:33:42,700 --> 00:33:45,200
After that, her brother came to look for her.

399
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:50,680
Her brother also started crying furiously. He may have been relieved.

400
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,550
You exaggerate your story.

401
00:33:53,900 --> 00:33:56,650
I didn't cry furiously. It was like a tear dropped.

402
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,450
Mikuru!

403
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,100
Why are you crying?

404
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:23,050
Give me your hands.

405
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:32,850
I'll give them to you. Keep them, and you'll be happy.

406
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:34,650
Thank you.

407
00:34:35,450 --> 00:34:36,500
Hiro!

408
00:34:39,500 --> 00:34:40,230
She is my sister.

409
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,250
See? Something good happened.

410
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:48,350
No way! Was that Hiroki?

411
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:49,700
Then, she was Mikuru.

412
00:34:50,450 --> 00:34:53,500
Wait a second. Did you realize that girl was me?

413
00:34:53,730 --> 00:35:00,780
There aren't many people who say such a lie if you can grab 3 petals at once...", with a sparkling smile, right?

414
00:35:01,530 --> 00:35:05,950
Do you know you'll be happy if you can grab 3 petals at once?

415
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,550
Makoto, you're surprisingly good at lying.

416
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:15,150
It's not a lie. It's more like a superstition.

417
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:17,150
Something like, "Believers shall be saved"

418
00:35:17,300 --> 00:35:19,750
But apparently, that has a different true meaning.

419
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:26,730
The true meaning is that you can go to heaven if you believe in Christ, without offerings or pilgrimages.

420
00:35:27,330 --> 00:35:28,530
Really?

421
00:35:29,650 --> 00:35:34,230
Well, it seems like my life won't lead me to heaven, even though I believe in Christ.

422
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:37,930
Are you a Christian in the first place?

423
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:39,350
No.

424
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:46,950
But since you've been saving me, that may be enough.

425
00:35:51,650 --> 00:36:02,650
Everything about Mikuru being lost and my mother trying to leave Mikuru alone scared me.

426
00:36:06,350 --> 00:36:10,580
But you saved me.

427
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:18,230
You haven't changed since then.

428
00:36:20,980 --> 00:36:25,180
You always help someone without gain or loss.

429
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:35,100
Is there anybody who can say something like, "I'll find the truth for the victims" with such unclouded eyes?

430
00:36:36,600 --> 00:36:38,050
And to the stranger you just met?

431
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,980
I want to solve this incident.

432
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:46,830
I'll find the truth for the victims.

433
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:57,000
I want you to stay true to yourself.

434
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:03,650
Hiroki,

435
00:37:13,900 --> 00:37:14,830
Let's go home.

436
00:37:30,850 --> 00:37:35,300
Hey, does that mean you've been in love with me since then?

437
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,330
You jump to conclusions!

438
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:44,480
I like sweet memories, but I'm still waiting for you to say in 2 simple words.

439
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:45,950
What are 2 simple words?

440
00:37:49,330 --> 00:37:51,780
Sushi!
Jerk.

441
00:37:51,850 --> 00:37:53,430
I'm kidding.

442
00:37:58,050 --> 00:37:58,830
Suri. (a pickpocket)

443
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,630
I'm kidding.

444
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:16,050
I want to talk to you. Do you have time?

445
00:38:21,050 --> 00:38:22,850
The TV station is a news organization.

446
00:38:22,980 --> 00:38:24,500
Yes, you're absolutely right.

447
00:38:25,300 --> 00:38:28,850
Morning Flash seems to be doing very well. But please don't get carried away too much.

448
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,280
She is your boss, right?

449
00:38:36,830 --> 00:38:38,200
She is desperate, isn't she?

450
00:38:40,230 --> 00:38:43,980
She is trying to suck up to the executives of the news section to get back into it.

451
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:57,180
Is it true that you've been lacking enthusiasm for The Eye of Horus Murder Incident lately because you wanted to get back into the news section?

452
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,330
Oh, you caught me.

453
00:39:03,130 --> 00:39:08,850
Was it you who tried to give the footage of the suspect that I filmed to the news section?

454
00:39:10,830 --> 00:39:13,600
The variety show can't outsmart the news section, right?

455
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:24,750
At first, I thought that if the ratings of Morning Flash increased, my reputation would rise, and I'd be able to get back into the news section.

456
00:39:26,650 --> 00:39:29,050
But because you kept getting so many scoops...

457
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:34,350
I thought that if I ruined the reputation of the news section. I couldn't get back into it.

458
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:41,980
I used to be an excellent journalist.

459
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:48,150
I was told to be the first female head of the news section.

460
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:57,050
But I got married and had a baby...

461
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:07,150
While my child was little, the hours I could work were limited.

462
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:13,930
That's why I was taken off the news section.

463
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:23,900
I don't regret it because it was the life I chose for myself...But...

464
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:31,280
Didn't you like our show?

465
00:40:32,300 --> 00:40:38,130
I do. I like both the show and the team.

466
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:44,980
But this isn't the kind of work I want to do.

467
00:40:49,430 --> 00:40:50,350
Were you disappointed?

468
00:40:55,950 --> 00:40:57,680
To be honest, I'm shocked.

469
00:40:59,450 --> 00:41:02,130
But this is who I am.

470
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:09,250
This is my true self that you haven't seen.

471
00:41:14,200 --> 00:41:17,050
So, what do you want to talk to me about?

472
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:21,030
Well, I can guess it.

473
00:41:23,480 --> 00:41:25,380
Please let me go back to the team for The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

474
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:31,430
I still want to reveal the truth about The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

475
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:40,680
You may come to know more unexpected sides of Hiroki that you haven't seen and don't want to know, just like me.

476
00:41:43,150 --> 00:41:44,200
Are you prepared?

477
00:41:47,230 --> 00:41:48,050
Yes.

478
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:53,030
All right.

479
00:41:57,630 --> 00:42:02,880
As I said, there're a lot of security cameras installed here.

480
00:42:02,950 --> 00:42:04,530
I'm sorry.

481
00:42:04,700 --> 00:42:08,380
Since you're falling behind, please listen to me carefully.

482
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:10,180
His character has changed a lot, right?

483
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,530
I grew as a person!

484
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:16,180
Listen, you should find a fresh approach.

485
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:18,350
You took me off the team...

486
00:42:20,030 --> 00:42:21,530
Don't give me that look.

487
00:42:23,650 --> 00:42:29,330
Hey, don't think to try to figure out the truth.

488
00:42:31,230 --> 00:42:35,730
You should accept the facts in front of you as they are.

489
00:42:36,730 --> 00:42:37,800
Everything starts from that.

490
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:00,330
Hey, wait!

491
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:26,180
Tsutsui Makoto

492
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:30,900
Thank you.

493
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:37,630
Those rice balls!

494
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:39,030
I bought them.

495
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:27,650
Are you playing a detective?

496
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:34,830
Good morning. Morning Flash, June 6th.

497
00:44:35,180 --> 00:44:38,750
Regarding The Eye of Horus Murder Incident that we've been broadcasting day after day,

498
00:44:39,150 --> 00:44:43,000
it's said that a new incident may occur today, June 6th.

499
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,130
Yes, please take a look at this map.

500
00:44:46,200 --> 00:44:49,930
The area where a new crime is expected to occur is Hino City, Tokyo.

501
00:44:50,130 --> 00:44:51,230
Those who live in this area...

502
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,780
I wonder if this prediction will be right.

503
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:57,780
We'll place police officers mainly around the Hino Station.

504
00:44:58,200 --> 00:45:00,830
And also the south of Toyoda Station and Asakawadai...

505
00:45:00,950 --> 00:45:05,380
It's frustrating that we'll investigate based on info from a TV show.

506
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:10,350
But we can't ignore them since their prediction was right last time.

507
00:45:20,630 --> 00:45:22,950
Have you heard of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident?

508
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:25,280
June 6th, 4 pm

509
00:45:23,180 --> 00:45:24,100
Of course, I have.

510
00:45:24,200 --> 00:45:27,320
Hino City is predicted to be the next crime area...

511
00:45:27,330 --> 00:45:29,380
I'm scared.

512
00:45:29,430 --> 00:45:32,480
Please be cautious to secure your home, especially tonight.

513
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:39,300

514
00:45:35,780 --> 00:45:42,750
Excuse me, I'm from JBC TV. May I do an interview?
Yes.

515
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:47,300
June 6th, 10:50 pm

516
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:45,930
It may not be Hino City.

517
00:45:46,750 --> 00:45:48,650
What should we do? Do you want to try to move to another location?

518
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:50,930
I want to stick here until midnight.

519
00:45:51,500 --> 00:45:55,950
I want to stop this crime and help arrest the suspect.

520
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:04,780
What?

521
00:46:14,280 --> 00:46:20,280
Makoto...I love you.

522
00:46:25,750 --> 00:46:27,750
It's the wrong time to say that.

523
00:46:28,250 --> 00:46:29,830
And your level of Like increased to Love.

524
00:46:33,480 --> 00:46:34,780
I'm going to the washroom.

525
00:46:36,980 --> 00:46:38,550
Don't move, stay there.

526
00:46:39,250 --> 00:46:41,450
That's also the wrong time.

527
00:49:57,980 --> 00:50:01,600
I told you not to move.

528
00:50:09,910 --> 00:50:11,480
Next week

529
00:50:11,600 --> 00:50:13,800
Nobody can stop me.
