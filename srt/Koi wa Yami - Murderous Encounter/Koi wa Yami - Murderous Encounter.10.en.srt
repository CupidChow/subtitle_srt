1
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,250
You're a moron to come all the way here to get killed.

2
00:00:09,250 --> 00:00:12,730
Because you keep lying.

3
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,680
I have to see the truth with my own eyes.

4
00:00:23,080 --> 00:00:29,330
I'm sorry. To be honest, I didn't want to get you involved.

5
00:00:31,750 --> 00:00:36,430
However, I can't go back anymore.

6
00:00:40,880 --> 00:00:46,780
I'm going to show you a show I created that will be worth this series of murders.

7
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,650
Hey, this is...

8
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,250
I'll show you everything from beginning to end.

9
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,480
Makoto...

10
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,180
Breaking news from Tozai Press.

11
00:01:00,630 --> 00:01:12,500
Suspect Shitara Hiroki, who posted a crime warning in a weekly magazine, is currently holding a woman in her 30s and threatening to kill her in a live stream.

12
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:22,450
Everybody, I tell you that The Eye of Horus Murder Incident will end tonight.

13
00:01:22,530 --> 00:01:23,950
Identify this place ASAP!

14
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,530
Watch the steps!

15
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,230
Makoto, are you all right?

16
00:01:45,350 --> 00:01:49,500
I saw you outside earlier. Just in case, I came to see.

17
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:55,880
I'll be the hostage for her.

18
00:01:57,480 --> 00:02:01,900
So, please release Makoto.

19
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,900
What? Is it Itsuki?!

20
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,430
Kinoshita,

21
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,430
Hurry up!

22
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,080
What happened?

23
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,680
Let me take care of it.

24
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:16,550
Hey, what the hell is going on?!

25
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:17,780
Who was he?

26
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,450
Everybody is getting excited. Great! Get more excited!

27
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:45,850
Final episode

28
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,100
Alright...Hiroki, what the hell are you doing?

29
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:50,850
That's against our rule, right?

30
00:02:51,050 --> 00:02:53,550
It's my job to hunt for prey.

31
00:02:55,130 --> 00:02:57,780
It's not nice to steal someone else's role.

32
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,630
We're a team, right?

33
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,030
By the way, I never expected Makoto to be the prey this time.

34
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:10,180
I'm looking forward to it.

35
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,900
Have you watched a live stream? What happened to Makoto?

36
00:03:23,030 --> 00:03:27,180
Calm down. There's no way Shitara would kill Makoto.

37
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,230
If I'd come here sooner...

38
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,050
Aoi, is there any clue left in Makoto's room?

39
00:03:33,080 --> 00:03:36,130
Is there any clue or something that can identify that place?

40
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:37,650
Any clue?

41
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:41,880
"The place where it all began", I believe this place has something to do with Shitara's mother's murder incident.

42
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:43,980
We're searching for clues right now, but...

43
00:03:44,350 --> 00:03:45,780
Got it.

44
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,280
Itsuki, I knew it was you.

45
00:04:04,880 --> 00:04:06,800
What? Did you know it was me?

46
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:14,080
Hiroki's memoir was convincing, but it also had a sense of discomfort.

47
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:19,080
I thought there was still something secret about this incident, and I ended up reaching out to you.

48
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:25,350
Itsuki, it was you who attacked me on May 5th, right?

49
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,750
Bingo! But how did you know it was me?

50
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:33,750
It's the scent.

51
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,080
What? The scent?

52
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:39,180
I didn't realize it at all since it was raining that day.

53
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:47,530
But on June 6th, I felt something was wrong.

54
00:04:49,030 --> 00:04:51,700
That day, I felt like I smelled a scent I'd smelled somewhere before.

55
00:04:52,150 --> 00:04:53,800
Makoto, you're amazing!

56
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:56,330
I was standing by the stairs at that time.

57
00:04:58,600 --> 00:05:03,080
I wiped off the blood as much as I could, but the smell of it just wouldn't go away.

58
00:05:03,750 --> 00:05:07,700
So, I always keep my favorite lavender perfume with me.

59
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:09,800
I see.

60
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:15,280
I hadn't noticed until now, but...
Itsuki!

61
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,800
I'm sorry.
Ah, it smells good.

62
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,250
When I smelled lavender the other day, everything finally made sense.

63
00:05:23,180 --> 00:05:24,850
Great detective, Makoto!

64
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:29,150
Hey, what does "Team" mean?

65
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:33,430
We've been committing crimes together as a team for a long time.

66
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:38,500
However, Hiroki is trying to take all the credit for himself.

67
00:05:44,250 --> 00:05:47,130
That's not nice. I'm going to hate you.

68
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,750
If I'm going to be arrested by the police anyway, it's better to be noticed by the public, right?

69
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:03,500
This century's greatest crime was planned and carried out by me.

70
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:07,530
I'm the only one who will be remembered in history.

71
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:13,800
Ah, I feel great. The public got very excited, right?

72
00:06:14,330 --> 00:06:16,500
I felt like I'd become a god.

73
00:06:18,830 --> 00:06:20,780
Why do you look so frustrated?

74
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,600
You came here because you didn't want me to take all the glory, right?

75
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,200
You can't do anything by yourself.

76
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,180
There're people in this world who want to steal credit from others.

77
00:06:33,350 --> 00:06:36,850
I'm the one who plotted The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

78
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:42,680
Just so you know, I didn't come here because I was frustrated.

79
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,200
I came up with a more interesting story.

80
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:48,950
What kind of story?

81
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,350
That's still a secret.

82
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:57,450
Makoto, don't worry.

83
00:06:58,450 --> 00:07:02,080
I don't think Hiroki can kill you.

84
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:06,350
But I'll make sure to kill you.

85
00:07:12,030 --> 00:07:13,400
You're underestimating me too much.

86
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:18,000
I won't give you Makoto.

87
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,750
You're cool!

88
00:07:26,850 --> 00:07:28,780
I'm in a hurry. Please let me go!

89
00:07:28,830 --> 00:07:30,230
We'll take care of the materials.

90
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:34,750
Stop fooling around! My subordinate's life is at risk!

91
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:38,480
Ah, Matsuoka!

92
00:07:38,900 --> 00:07:41,480
It's me, Noda from JBC!

93
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:44,680
Owada and I used to often go drinking together!

94
00:07:48,730 --> 00:07:51,930
All right, don't scream!

95
00:07:52,050 --> 00:07:53,430
Please check this.

96
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:59,650
Ta-dah! We're wearing matching clothes and shoes.

97
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,280
Hey, if I'm going to be killed anyway, please let me know before that.

98
00:08:09,030 --> 00:08:10,650
What kind of relationship do you two have?

99
00:08:13,830 --> 00:08:15,800
I first met him 10 years ago.

100
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:20,600
He was at the scene where my mother was murdered.

101
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:23,900
Thank you for your hard work.

102
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,300
July 20th, 2015

103
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:28,980
That day, I was supposed to go ask my mother to help pay Mikuru's medical expenses.

104
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:30,180
Have you arrived?

105
00:08:30,730 --> 00:08:33,980
Hiro, a lot of blood...

106
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:37,480
Mikuru, what happened?

107
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:41,530
I killed a mother.

108
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:43,500
Mikuru?

109
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:45,550
Mikuru!

110
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,830
Mom...

111
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:54,530
What? Mom!

112
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:11,650
Mom, say something!

113
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:21,050
Mom!

114
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,530
Wow, there's another one.

115
00:09:25,930 --> 00:09:26,850
Who are you?

116
00:09:29,650 --> 00:09:30,750
Guess who?

117
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,350
Where's my sister?

118
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,050
Ah, that lady? She is gone.

119
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:45,980
Did you kill her?

120
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:50,500
No way! Your sister killed her.

121
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,060
I just made it a little more dramatic after she is gone.
Don't lie.

122
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:03,680
It's true. I felt sorry for her. I couldn't help but cry a bit.

123
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:07,050
She is sick and has neither money nor a family registry, right?

124
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,550
But this bitch lost her temper at your sister.

125
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:17,850
They struggled, and your sister stabbed your mother with a knife.

126
00:10:18,050 --> 00:10:21,600
Don't lie! There's no way Mikuru would do that.

127
00:10:23,180 --> 00:10:27,900
Everybody has a murderous intention.

128
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:31,550
But everybody is just hiding it.

129
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,250
Do you want to die here?

130
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:45,830
Ah, but if that's the case, your sister would become a serial killer who murdered her mother and brother.

131
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,750
There's no way the police would believe such a lie.

132
00:10:49,830 --> 00:10:51,650
I'll testify as an eyewitness.

133
00:10:52,430 --> 00:11:00,150
Which one would the police believe, your sister who doesn't have a family registry and was abandoned by her parent, or an innocent boy?

134
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:03,300
What's your purpose?

135
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,730
I came here to kill her.

136
00:11:08,150 --> 00:11:12,900
I researched ways to leave no trace, and I came here fully prepared.

137
00:11:13,280 --> 00:11:17,430
But your sister got ahead of me. I was so disappointed.

138
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:21,250
Why did you want to kill her?

139
00:11:24,230 --> 00:11:29,800
She insulted my mother because my mother made a tiny mistake at the register.

140
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,000
She said, "That's why I hate a woman without a good education."

141
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,300
What did she think she was?

142
00:11:37,030 --> 00:11:42,130
Women who behave like V.I.P.s, like your mother, believe they belong to a high social class.

143
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,350
They always look down on others.

144
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:47,380
Don't indulge yourself!

145
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:54,200
My mother is kind, hardworking, and cares for everybody.

146
00:11:54,780 --> 00:11:57,080
However, her priority is always me.

147
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:02,400
If my favorite potato salad was left unsold, she would buy it and hurried back home.

148
00:12:02,730 --> 00:12:05,250
She said, "I thought you must be hungry."

149
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:09,480
And yet, that bitch hurt my mother's feelings.

150
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,600
There're people in this world who deserve to die!

151
00:12:17,250 --> 00:12:22,300
Are you saying you wanted to kill Hiroki's mother because your beloved mother was verbally abused by Hiroki's mother?

152
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:28,780
That's why this supermarket where your mother used to work is "The place where it all began", right?

153
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:34,980
Yes, I thought Hiroki was calling me when I read his article.

154
00:12:36,150 --> 00:12:37,880
Why did you tell that to Makoto as well?

155
00:12:39,780 --> 00:12:41,080
I didn't.

156
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:45,280
Really? Makoto, you're a psychic!

157
00:12:47,150 --> 00:12:48,300
Maybe, I am...

158
00:12:49,750 --> 00:12:51,730
Damn it, there's no clue!

159
00:12:56,230 --> 00:12:57,000
Hello?

160
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:59,900
I can't find anything.

161
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:03,380
There should be clues there that helped Makoto identify the place.

162
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,680
Shitara Kumiko...

163
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:23,700
There’s a card from Yotsuba Supermarket, Tachikawa branch, with Shitara Kumiko’s name on it.

164
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:25,480
Yotsuba Supermarket?

165
00:13:29,380 --> 00:13:32,180
I got an address. I'll go there anyway. Thank you, Aoi.

166
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,380
Be careful.

167
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:39,330
Masakiyo, please save her no matter what.

168
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:43,350
I know.

169
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,300
Have you identified the location yet?

170
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:50,280
This is Komine. I've found a possible location.

171
00:13:50,550 --> 00:13:52,530
It's Yotsuba Supermarket, Tachikawa branch!

172
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:56,280
The supermarket closed a few years ago, but the building still seems to be there.

173
00:13:56,430 --> 00:13:57,600
I'll send more police officers there immediately.

174
00:13:57,730 --> 00:13:59,580
Make sure to arrest Shitara Hiroki!

175
00:14:01,230 --> 00:14:04,130
Excuse me for interrupting you during your busy time.

176
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:05,900
Unauthorized persons are not permitted to enter.

177
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:08,030
Please watch this!

178
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,050
It's worth watching.

179
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:14,930
Owada got very important evidence.

180
00:14:19,150 --> 00:14:22,800
After all, you killed them all by yourself, right?

181
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:34,750
Owada asked me to introduce a good video analysis company.

182
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,350
And this is the result.

183
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:43,880
They figured out how Shitara was grabbing the knife by analyzing the angle of his arm and the position of his shoulder.

184
00:14:45,380 --> 00:14:48,100
Please compare it with how the suspect grabs the knife.

185
00:14:48,730 --> 00:14:50,500
They're obviously different.

186
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:53,880
Does that mean they're not the same person?

187
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:59,650
The fact that Shitara held the knife like this means he's never killed anybody.

188
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,830
With his grip, he'd cut his hand and couldn't grab the knife before killing them.

189
00:15:08,230 --> 00:15:13,080
In other words, Shitara Hiroki isn't a murderer.

190
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:16,430
The real suspect is somebody else.

191
00:15:20,830 --> 00:15:23,600
That's right, I'm the one who killed all of them.

192
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:29,980
However, we're a team, right, Hiroki?

193
00:15:35,150 --> 00:15:40,380
I won't tell anybody that I met you here.

194
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,400
Let's end it like that.
No way.

195
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:47,600
Because I had a lot of fun.

196
00:15:49,330 --> 00:15:54,000
I thought it'd be better for the world if this bitch were killed, and I did it.

197
00:15:57,130 --> 00:16:01,250
However, I got more excited than I'd expected. I felt very good.

198
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,580
I want to do it again.

199
00:16:03,400 --> 00:16:06,250
Ah, how about something like this?

200
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,450
Your sister will die without transfusions, right?

201
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:13,900
In that case, let's be a team from now on!

202
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:16,080
A team?

203
00:16:16,250 --> 00:16:19,730
I'll find a healthy person who annoys me.

204
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,180
First, you take blood from that person.

205
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:24,830
And I kill that person.

206
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,350
How does that sound? Isn't it a good idea?

207
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:35,800
What's your advantage?

208
00:16:36,250 --> 00:16:39,180
In case of an emergency, can you get arrested instead of me?

209
00:16:42,430 --> 00:16:44,430
Or would you want to die here?

210
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:51,430
I understood.

211
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:56,830
What's your name?

212
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:01,380
I'm Shitara Hiroki.

213
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:04,780
If you betray me, I'll kill you.

214
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:07,900
And I'll make it look like your sister killed you.

215
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,300
Don't forget that, Hiroki.

216
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,580
My mother was stabbed to death.

217
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,850
I called 911 an hour later.

218
00:17:33,030 --> 00:17:35,400
The next morning after I was interrogated by the police,

219
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:36,480
Mikuru?

220
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,900
Mikuru's memory was unclear because she was so shocked.

221
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:47,580
That was lucky.

222
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,900
I knew you were the one who killed my mother!

223
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,000
Wasn't it obvious? Are you a moron?

224
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,630
You're a moron!

225
00:17:55,130 --> 00:17:56,680
Makoto, don't scare me.

226
00:17:56,730 --> 00:17:59,780
Hiroki, you too. Why did you obey him?

227
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:02,830
You're right.

228
00:18:16,350 --> 00:18:20,680
I received the insurance money after my mother died.

229
00:18:20,750 --> 00:18:27,030
I wanted to use that money to get Mikuru a bone marrow transplant, so I began the process of applying for her family registry.

230
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,300
September 20th, 2015

231
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:37,830
I thought I could finally get Mikuru proper treatment, but...

232
00:18:57,350 --> 00:19:00,030
That was the agreement, right?

233
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:03,650
Have you two been killing people even before The Eye of Horus Murder Incident?

234
00:19:05,900 --> 00:19:11,200
That's right. We've maintained good teamwork for 10 years, right?

235
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:16,500
September 21st, 2015

236
00:19:23,800 --> 00:19:26,030
I broke into the victim's house first.

237
00:19:31,350 --> 00:19:32,950
We restrained the victim,

238
00:19:47,300 --> 00:19:48,580
and Hiroki took blood from her.

239
00:19:55,330 --> 00:20:02,630
As soon as Hiroki left, I killed the victim.

240
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:13,900
After we successfully committed a crime together, I knew Hiroki wouldn't betray me.

241
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:17,250
So, I set it up to make Hiroki's father look like the suspect.

242
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:19,600
Did you file a false report with the police?

243
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,480
Yes, and I was the one who threw the murder weapon into the river.

244
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,280
I wanted to kill people, and Hiroki wanted healthy blood for his sister.

245
00:20:29,980 --> 00:20:33,950
It was a win-win relationship. Why are you betraying me now?

246
00:20:34,330 --> 00:20:39,050
A win-win relationship? It's bullshit!

247
00:20:40,550 --> 00:20:45,250
I only got one-sided messages from you, and I didn't even know your name.

248
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,200
But,

249
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:49,600
He is the deliveryman...

250
00:20:49,750 --> 00:20:51,800
Nice to meet you, I'm Natsuyagi Itsuki.

251
00:20:53,650 --> 00:20:54,500
Hello.

252
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:57,080
Have I met you somewhere before?

253
00:20:57,700 --> 00:21:02,050
Makoto made us get closer.

254
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,330
We had a lot of fun, right?

255
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,780
Itsuki, were you the one who sent me info about Hiroki?

256
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,130
That was pretty interesting, right?

257
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:15,930
Did you hack into the police system to get that info?

258
00:21:16,130 --> 00:21:20,130
I'd been in the PC club since elementary school, so I'm quite skilled with computers.

259
00:21:20,450 --> 00:21:21,950
I'm a smart man.

260
00:21:23,730 --> 00:21:27,880
You should've used that skill for something else.

261
00:21:29,050 --> 00:21:34,050
Ah, but trash people are trash because they can only use their skills for trashy things!

262
00:21:34,330 --> 00:21:35,650
I'm not trash!

263
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,880
Don't you still realize how elaborate and beautiful the crimes I've created were?

264
00:21:41,950 --> 00:21:43,280
Stop fooling around!

265
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:50,200
Hey, Buddy, please explain it to Makoto since she doesn't seem to understand.

266
00:21:51,650 --> 00:21:53,800
I'm not your buddy.

267
00:21:56,450 --> 00:22:02,350
I bought the blood at the hospital and used it for my sister.

268
00:22:04,630 --> 00:22:09,350
I bought it from an underground doctor so that neither you nor the police would find out.

269
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:12,000
What? But you took so much blood from the victims.

270
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,550
There was no way I could use that kind of blood.

271
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:23,530
But...Only once, the first time...

272
00:22:26,150 --> 00:22:31,350
Mikuru?

273
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,630
At that time, I desperately needed blood immediately...

274
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:49,600
Please don't do that anymore.

275
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,100
Don't worry about me anymore.

276
00:22:56,550 --> 00:23:01,800
I'm sorry I can't get you proper treatment.

277
00:23:06,600 --> 00:23:08,480
That almost killed my sister.

278
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:13,330
I can only transfuse a safe blood product to her.

279
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,000
Really?

280
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:20,330
Does that mean you kept taking blood just to gain my trust?

281
00:23:20,750 --> 00:23:23,000
How tragic! But it's hilarious!

282
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:27,930
If you hadn't been around, my sister could have received proper treatment!

283
00:23:31,030 --> 00:23:34,950
That means I had a huge influence over you and your sister, right?

284
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:38,780
Don't mess around!

285
00:23:42,830 --> 00:23:43,800
Hiroki!

286
00:23:45,350 --> 00:23:50,630
Until today, I've ignored the victims you've killed.

287
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:55,850
So, I'm as guilty as you. I'm also a murderer.

288
00:23:56,050 --> 00:23:58,400
As guilty as I? You're shameless.

289
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:01,000
Your role is to write articles and stir up the incident, right?

290
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:08,080
I kept writing articles so that you couldn't get away and the public wouldn't forgive you.

291
00:24:09,950 --> 00:24:15,550
But I won't be forgiven no matter how much I atone.

292
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:21,480
So, at least I'll kill you.

293
00:24:23,850 --> 00:24:26,180
Hiroki, you can't commit a murder.

294
00:24:26,780 --> 00:24:30,180
You're the only person I can kill.

295
00:24:30,980 --> 00:24:32,280
Don't, Hiroki!

296
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:39,730
Makoto,

297
00:24:44,800 --> 00:24:47,130
I'm not the one who will die.

298
00:24:48,800 --> 00:24:52,850
Your mother works at a rice ball shop, right?

299
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,730
She came to visit my mother's grave.

300
00:24:59,030 --> 00:25:04,230
She was sorry for my mother because of how she was murdered.

301
00:25:11,350 --> 00:25:13,300
Your mother is a nice woman.

302
00:25:15,180 --> 00:25:21,150
I think even though she remarried and had another child, she still loved you.

303
00:25:21,250 --> 00:25:24,680
Shut up!

304
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:30,600
I'm the most important to my mother!

305
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,200
Makoto,

306
00:25:42,050 --> 00:25:44,000
Makoto, you're a nuisance.

307
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,500
You mama's boy!

308
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,250
Did you think I didn't notice?

309
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,230
You could capture the truth very well.

310
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:27,130
Komine and 3 other officers have arrived at the scene.

311
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:28,950
I'll check the inside of the building.

312
00:26:32,650 --> 00:26:35,200
This is the right place. I see Shitara Hiroki.

313
00:26:35,850 --> 00:26:39,430
Wait to enter until backups arrive.

314
00:26:40,150 --> 00:26:41,280
Got it.

315
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:46,830
I'll let you know the story from now on.

316
00:26:47,800 --> 00:26:56,680
Hiroki will kill Makoto and then commit suicide...And,

317
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,130
I'll risk my life to protect Makoto, but I won't be able to do that.

318
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:15,800
I'll be the hero of the tragedy who blames myself for not being able to stop the murderer's crime.

319
00:27:17,430 --> 00:27:20,430
Do you think it's an excellent story?

320
00:27:21,980 --> 00:27:25,880
I'm not sure. I don't think the police are that blind.

321
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:32,830
If you two die here, even though I'm arrested, there will be nobody to prove my suspicion, and there will be no evidence.

322
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:37,650
Being in a suspicious zone is fine as long as no one proves I'm the suspect.

323
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:41,730
In this country, "Innocent until proven guilty".

324
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:45,780
Based on my testimony, the truth is created.

325
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,450
Let's bring this to an end.

326
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,900
The game is over.

327
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:03,380
Goodbye.

328
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:18,280
Hiroki!

329
00:28:19,580 --> 00:28:21,550
Hiroki!

330
00:28:21,980 --> 00:28:23,280
Die!

331
00:28:34,750 --> 00:28:36,130
Hiroki,

332
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:42,780
Makoto, are you hurt?

333
00:28:43,330 --> 00:28:44,730
Hiroki,

334
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:49,430
Hiroki, hang in there!

335
00:29:16,130 --> 00:29:17,130
Don't move!

336
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:31,830
At 8:23 pm, you're under arrest on suspicion of attempted murder.

337
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:43,430
Hiroki,

338
00:29:53,830 --> 00:30:05,430
I thought that as long as Mikuru could survive, I wouldn't mind being made the suspect.

339
00:30:07,130 --> 00:30:20,650
But when I was with you, I realized that I had to tell the truth.

340
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,300
I never imagined I'd meet you again.

341
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:43,880
I met you again, and I've had a lot of fun being with you since then. I realized that I smiled naturally again.

342
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:54,030
I thought many times that I didn't deserve it.

343
00:30:54,550 --> 00:30:56,480
I love Hiroki who is in front of me.

344
00:31:01,530 --> 00:31:04,050
I just couldn't leave you, no matter what.

345
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,480
I don't want to make the people I love sad.

346
00:31:09,100 --> 00:31:10,780
So, I'm glad I'm alive.

347
00:31:13,230 --> 00:31:15,180
Hiroki, you're one of the people I love.

348
00:31:19,650 --> 00:31:24,330
Thank you for coming. I felt relieved.

349
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:33,150
I love you.
Okay.

350
00:31:33,530 --> 00:31:37,450
Come on! I love you!

351
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:42,900
I excused my sin by saying I'd protect you...

352
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:50,980
Just now...Just a little longer...

353
00:31:58,130 --> 00:32:04,400
I'm sorry for getting you involved.

354
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:10,930
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you the truth.

355
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:17,330
That's all right. Please don't talk anymore.

356
00:32:19,150 --> 00:32:23,700
I'm so sorry.

357
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,630
I won't forgive you if you die!

358
00:32:34,550 --> 00:32:37,000
I'll hold a grudge against you for the rest of my life!

359
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,180
I'm a scary woman.

360
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:43,500
You wouldn't want to be hated by a woman like me, right?

361
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:46,780
No...

362
00:32:52,050 --> 00:32:53,280
So, don't hate me.

363
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:02,780
Please forget about me.

364
00:33:11,530 --> 00:33:13,030
Be happy.

365
00:33:15,230 --> 00:33:23,000
I can't. Because if you die, I'll be unhappy for the rest of my life.

366
00:33:25,550 --> 00:33:32,000
Makoto, I love you.

367
00:33:36,300 --> 00:33:46,900
You're straightforward, pure, and cheerful.

368
00:33:47,130 --> 00:33:51,500
Don't talk!

369
00:33:51,580 --> 00:33:53,430
I've always loved you.

370
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:00,330
I've loved you ever since the first time I met you.

371
00:34:02,300 --> 00:34:07,400
Makoto, I love you.

372
00:34:11,230 --> 00:34:12,850
I love you so much.

373
00:34:16,230 --> 00:34:22,950
Thank you for meeting me.

374
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:36,350
No! Hiroki!

375
00:34:37,980 --> 00:34:41,330
No! Hiroki!

376
00:34:52,630 --> 00:34:58,430
The suspect arrested in the act of suspicion of attempted murder is Natsuyagi Itsuki, 24.

377
00:35:00,780 --> 00:35:02,830
I can't believe Itsuki is the suspect...

378
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,180
What about Makoto?

379
00:35:06,300 --> 00:35:07,730
We just received breaking news.

380
00:35:08,180 --> 00:35:10,750
It seems that the woman who was confined by the suspect has been safely released.

381
00:35:10,850 --> 00:35:15,430
Thank god!

382
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:18,050
Do you think that Tsutsui will be able to appear on the live broadcast tomorrow morning?

383
00:35:18,180 --> 00:35:19,780
Give me a break!

384
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:27,830
And suspect Shitara Hiroki was transported to the hospital in unconscious and critical condition.﻿

385
00:35:27,950 --> 00:35:30,250
I repeat. The suspect...

386
00:35:34,350 --> 00:35:37,530
Makoto,
Aoi,

387
00:35:39,330 --> 00:35:41,650
Are you all right? Are you injured?

388
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:44,800
But Hiroki is...

389
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:52,300
Hiroki ended this incident, right?

390
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:55,780
However the evidence data was taken by Itsuki.

391
00:35:57,380 --> 00:36:00,850
So, I have no way to convey the truth to the world as it is.

392
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:03,850
Moron! Your own life is the most important!

393
00:36:04,030 --> 00:36:06,930
I never think it's admirable to ignore the danger!

394
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,830
Sorry.

395
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:17,000
You didn't answer your phone, and...

396
00:36:18,950 --> 00:36:20,200
My phone...

397
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:36,000
Shitara Hiroki
Sent the link address

398
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,980
What's this?

399
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:02,400
This is...

400
00:37:11,480 --> 00:37:14,350
You're a moron to come all the way here to get killed.

401
00:37:14,450 --> 00:37:16,680
Sorry, I have to go.

402
00:37:19,180 --> 00:37:24,630
Give me a break, I feel my lifespan has been shortened...
Right.

403
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:34,980
Shitara, don't die.

404
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:43,730
Everybody, I'm sorry for causing you worry.

405
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:52,680
Moron! How much danger do you have to face before you're satisfied?

406
00:37:53,350 --> 00:37:54,200
I'm sorry.

407
00:37:54,300 --> 00:37:57,030
She is right! I can't believe it!

408
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:02,530
Hey, Makoto, give me a break!

409
00:38:02,580 --> 00:38:04,780
Makoto!

410
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:13,650
Well, I have footage that I want to broadcast in tomorrow's show.

411
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:21,700
Owada is the only person I liked among the people I killed.

412
00:38:22,450 --> 00:38:24,980
But because she realized the truth...

413
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,800
Usually, I pretended to be left-handed as camouflage.

414
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:34,880
But that day, I unconsciously caught her with my right hand.

415
00:38:35,830 --> 00:38:38,780
Since then, I'd been following her because I wanted to find out how much she'd realized.

416
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,580
This is a good idea.

417
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,000
It's very popular.

418
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:44,280
She even visited my mother's rice ball shop.

419
00:38:44,680 --> 00:38:46,300
May I ask you something?

420
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:50,480
I'm Owada Kayo from the 1st Investigation Division in the MPD.

421
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,900
And she visited the hospital as well.

422
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,800
I knew it.

423
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:09,780
I was hoping I was wrong.

424
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:18,100
Kayo, I like you so much.

425
00:39:22,330 --> 00:39:26,980
My alibi was perfect. But Kayo saw through it.

426
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:32,150
I wish she were as stupid as you.

427
00:39:33,230 --> 00:39:34,200
Poor her.

428
00:39:47,100 --> 00:39:52,180
We'll broadcast the exclusive 56-minute footage leading up to the arrest of suspect Natsuyagi Itsuki.

429
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:56,100
I'm the one who plotted The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

430
00:39:58,050 --> 00:40:00,850
Just so you know, I didn't come here because I was frustrated.

431
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:05,130
I came up with a more interesting story.

432
00:40:06,830 --> 00:40:08,400
Makoto, don't worry.

433
00:40:09,580 --> 00:40:15,500
I don't think Hiroki can kill you. But I'll make sure to kill you.

434
00:40:15,730 --> 00:40:20,550
The footage that Hiroki risked his life to entrust to me sparked a huge public reaction.

435
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:21,900
The wipe with Kojima,

436
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:26,950
And...

437
00:40:33,470 --> 00:40:35,080
Shitara Mikuru

438
00:40:55,350 --> 00:40:57,950
Makoto, Hiro is...

439
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:25,880
Hiroki has regained consciousness.

440
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:49,150
Now, suspect Natsuyagi Itsuki is heading from Azabu Higashi Police Station to the Tokyo District Public Prosecutor's Office.

441
00:41:50,330 --> 00:41:53,850
Suspect Natsuyagi is smiling!

442
00:41:54,100 --> 00:41:58,200
The media continued to broadcast this incident day after day.

443
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:06,880
Everything that suspect Shitara wrote in his memoir was exactly the motive and method of suspect Natsuyagi's crime.

444
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,080
The media examined this incident from every possible angle.

445
00:42:11,230 --> 00:42:12,480
Another man showed up, and...

446
00:42:12,730 --> 00:42:21,480
The 6th victim awoke and told the police that Hiroki called 911 and desperately tried to stop the bleeding.

447
00:42:22,730 --> 00:42:27,780
It may be a bit late, but I'll try to be a father again.

448
00:42:29,730 --> 00:42:30,730
I see.

449
00:42:33,750 --> 00:42:37,780
Why did you think I was falsely accused?

450
00:42:40,150 --> 00:42:43,500
I thought if you were the suspect, the incident would be too clear.

451
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,700
Human beings are inconsistent.

452
00:42:51,850 --> 00:42:55,730
Please let me broadcast an exclusive interview with you on my show soon.

453
00:42:59,700 --> 00:43:02,130
I promise.

454
00:43:05,630 --> 00:43:07,150
Dad, it's done.

455
00:43:13,900 --> 00:43:16,230
Well, excuse us.

456
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:20,580
Let's go.

457
00:43:29,830 --> 00:43:35,430
And Itsuki was sentenced to death.

458
00:43:37,300 --> 00:43:40,850
People's interest in this incident gradually faded day by day.

459
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:45,800
July 22nd, 2026

460
00:43:41,980 --> 00:43:43,350
The day has finally come.

461
00:43:45,330 --> 00:43:47,230
I wonder what kind of verdict Hiroki will receive...

462
00:43:46,460 --> 00:43:48,930
Suspect Shitara's verdict is approaching tomorrow

463
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:55,750
Aoi, you always worry about everybody and stand by their side.
Do I?

464
00:43:57,880 --> 00:44:07,900
When Owada was killed, that drove me crazy. But because you were with me...

465
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:13,280
Thank you.

466
00:44:14,780 --> 00:44:16,880
I did what any friend would do.

467
00:44:18,980 --> 00:44:25,100
What you're looking for may be closer than you think. You just can't see it yet.

468
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:38,830
Well, is there a possibility that we're more than friends?

469
00:44:43,130 --> 00:44:47,350
Well, what can I say...
I love you.

470
00:44:49,750 --> 00:44:52,030
I've always loved you.

471
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:56,550
Damn it, I was about to say the same thing.

472
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:58,830
Because it seemed like it was going to take time.

473
00:45:00,580 --> 00:45:05,480
Okay, go ahead.
Go ahead?

474
00:45:09,530 --> 00:45:12,330
I love you too.

475
00:45:14,150 --> 00:45:20,330
Would you like to go out with me? Or let's go out!

476
00:45:21,600 --> 00:45:26,430
Or...Would you be my girlfriend?
Yes!

477
00:45:30,080 --> 00:45:31,230
I'm so embarrassed!

478
00:45:32,030 --> 00:45:34,800
Don't make me confess my feelings like this. I'm like a high school student.

479
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:36,180
I'm embarrassed too.

480
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,000
Suspect Shitara Hiroki was charged with murder as an accomplice of suspect Natsuyagi.

481
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,950
The prosecution is seeking a life sentence.

482
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:51,950
The defense is insisting that there was no conspiracy to commit murder between Shitara and Natsuyagi, and Shitara was in a subordinate position.

483
00:45:52,130 --> 00:45:54,700
Therefore, the defense is seeking a 10-year prison sentence and the charge of manslaughter.

484
00:45:55,130 --> 00:45:59,430
And the additional crimes Shitara confessed to were not prosecuted due to a lack of evidence.

485
00:46:01,000 --> 00:46:09,400
I was very close to Hiroki, but I didn't know the truth at all.

486
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:12,630
I've known him for 10 years.

487
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:16,930
I lost confidence in myself as a journalist.

488
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:27,380
He told me the other day that we could only ever know a part of others' lives.

489
00:46:30,130 --> 00:46:36,680
Even so, I don't want to give up and accept that I can't understand others.

490
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:54,400
I see. We don't understand many things. That's why we learn, think, and suspect so that we can trust people and society.

491
00:46:56,530 --> 00:46:57,950
Maybe, that's the only way.

492
00:47:00,130 --> 00:47:01,930
We suspect to believe...

493
00:47:08,030 --> 00:47:10,080
Shall we go?

494
00:47:51,600 --> 00:48:02,200
The judgment, as to the defendant, is that he is to be imprisoned for 15 years.

495
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:08,930
The truth is difficult.

496
00:48:11,030 --> 00:48:14,230
It changes depending on the angle.

497
00:48:16,250 --> 00:48:20,150
Which one is the truth? What's the truth?

498
00:48:21,450 --> 00:48:26,350
Maybe, the truth doesn't exist anywhere.

499
00:48:27,580 --> 00:48:28,580
Hiroki!

500
00:48:29,430 --> 00:48:38,000
But there's only one unwavering thing in my mind.

501
00:48:42,600 --> 00:48:43,850
I'll wait for you.

502
00:48:47,330 --> 00:48:48,680
Please don't.

503
00:48:50,780 --> 00:48:54,630
That's impossible. I'll wait for you.

504
00:49:11,980 --> 00:49:30,050
No matter whether 10 or 20 years pass, my feelings for you will definitely remain true.

505
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:39,580
Koi wa Yami (Love is Darkness)

506
00:49:42,100 --> 00:49:43,780
My crime is perfect.

507
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:47,150
Why was a vicious murderer born?

508
00:49:47,230 --> 00:49:49,400
I thought this crime occurred because of his inferiority complex.

509
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,650
That's not true! I'll kill him.
