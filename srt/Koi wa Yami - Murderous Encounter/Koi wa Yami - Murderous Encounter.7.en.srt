1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,750
The serial killing shaking the public, known as The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

2
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:09,450
The suspect's unusual behavior has been revealed.

3
00:00:09,550 --> 00:00:11,150
There was a needle mark on the body of the 5th victim

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,350
I think the suspect may have taken blood from her.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:17,080
I practiced collecting blood on him at home, he said he wanted to try collecting blood himself.

6
00:00:17,180 --> 00:00:19,880
When I became his regular customer, he asked me for blood.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:21,650
The fact that links to the suspect...

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:24,150
What are you doing?

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:25,400
Who are you?

10
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:26,400
I'm his accomplice.

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,380
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

12
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,550
That person is probably...my father.

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,280
So, you're still connected to your father, who is under police surveillance, right?

14
00:00:35,500 --> 00:00:37,530
I can't take this anymore!

15
00:00:37,630 --> 00:00:40,230
I've thought many times that I can't love him anymore, but...

16
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:44,730
I want you to keep smiling...

17
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:46,900
I wish we'd never met.

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,780
I find myself being dragged back to him.

19
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:52,050
As I thought, Shitara Kanji isn't the suspect of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

20
00:00:53,230 --> 00:01:00,300
The darkness I got lost in grows deeper and deeper...

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,950
Is there anything else you're concerned about?

22
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,100
Nothing. I'm really confused right now.

23
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:34,900
No way...Why? Owada...

24
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,480
Owada, why?!

25
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:44,950
Answer me, Owada!

26
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:03,050
Masakiyo,

27
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:19,950
I got a call from Owada.

28
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:27,730
She told me to go for a drink.

29
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,450
But why...

30
00:02:40,450 --> 00:02:45,930
The night shift staff, including me, were asked various questions by the police.

31
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,750
However, there's something I thought I should've told you first.

32
00:02:53,550 --> 00:02:55,750
I talked to Owada.

33
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:01,150
Excuse me, may I ask you something?

34
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,630
She seemed to be investigating something.

35
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:28,080
Good morning.

36
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,200
Hey, Tsutsui,

37
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,680
Good morning.

38
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,700
You closed the elevator even though you knew I was coming from behind, right?

39
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:35,960
No, I didn't.

40
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,930
I saw you hitting the close button furiously.

41
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,900
I hit the button furiously, but I didn't know you were there.

42
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:46,380
Breaking news.

43
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:54,450
A police officer was stabbed to death by an unknown suspect on hospital property.

44
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:56,430
Replace the top article!

45
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,480
If the news section has already sent a broadcast car, we'll...

46
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,680
The victim is Assistant Inspector Owada Kayo of the MPD, and...

47
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:05,280
What? She is...

48
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:06,750
Mihashi,

49
00:04:06,830 --> 00:04:10,050
Yes, I'm in front of Tokyo General Central Hospital, the crime scene.

50
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:16,250
Everybody has something they want to protect.

51
00:04:18,480 --> 00:04:22,500
Status, honor, family...

52
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:24,450
Hiro?

53
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:29,050
Someone you love, and secrets.

54
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:38,550
But if you choose the wrong way, it can destroy you.

55
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:55,550
Mikuru?

56
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:06,130
If I'm protecting her, or destroying her, or loving her, or hurting her...

57
00:05:07,850 --> 00:05:15,030
I may be wandering in the dark all the time because I'm too afraid to know the answer.

58
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:23,150
Koi wa Yami (Love is Darkness)

59
00:05:23,430 --> 00:05:27,480
We've interviewed the night shift staff, but we didn't get any info about the suspect.

60
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,500
Episode 7

61
00:05:27,750 --> 00:05:28,950
What about the footage from the security cameras?

62
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:32,180
The crime scene is in a blind spot, so there's no footage.

63
00:05:32,580 --> 00:05:34,500
The suspect is likely to know the camera positions.

64
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,180
I believe the suspect who killed Owada is the suspect from The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

65
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,130
There were fewer stab wounds, and she didn't wear contact lenses.

66
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:44,030
Moreover, this isn't a crime that happened on a day with repeating numbers.

67
00:05:44,150 --> 00:05:47,200
There's no doubt that the weapon used in this incident is the same type as the one in The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

68
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:55,330
Owada said over the phone that the suspect of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident wasn't Shitara Kanji last night.

69
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:02,300
I think she got some info and went to that hospital to verify it.

70
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:08,450
This is the list of people who conducted a comprehensive medical checkup at Tokyo General Central Hospital.

71
00:06:08,780 --> 00:06:12,530
According to a nurse, it seems that Owada was checking this list.

72
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:17,930
All the victims' names from The Eye of Horus Murder Incident are found in this list.

73
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:25,630
They all conducted a comprehensive medical checkup within 6 months before the incidents occurred.

74
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,580
You've reached that truth.

75
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:32,500
So, you're saying she'd discovered something in common among the victims of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

76
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:39,830
Yes, and the investigation notebook she always carried with her is missing.

77
00:06:42,630 --> 00:06:45,130
I remembered she had a notebook with a sticker on it.

78
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,850
She was killed by the suspect because she was getting closer to the truth of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

79
00:06:50,750 --> 00:06:52,700
I think it's reasonable to think that way.

80
00:06:53,350 --> 00:06:59,900
So, she said that the suspect wasn't Shitara Kanji, right?
Yes.

81
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,980
The suspect can't get this info alone.

82
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:08,850
Investigate thoroughly if there're eyewitnesses of the suspicious people around the hospital!

83
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,630
If Owada was right, it's also possible that the suspect of the incident 10 years ago wasn't Shitara Kanji...

84
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:20,830
For now, the priority is to identify the suspect of the Owada incident.

85
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,900
See you tomorrow, Morning Flash!

86
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,050
Are you all right?

87
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,980
Komine Masakiyo

88
00:07:44,180 --> 00:07:45,130
Hello?

89
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:48,550
Were you with Shitara Hiroki last night?

90
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,880
Why do you suddenly ask me that?

91
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:51,650
Answer me.

92
00:07:52,530 --> 00:07:53,730
I was with him.

93
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:55,280
Until what time?

94
00:07:55,800 --> 00:08:03,050
I fell asleep. But when I woke up around 11 pm, he was already gone.

95
00:08:04,950 --> 00:08:07,200
If that's the case, he doesn't have an alibi.

96
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:12,730
Were both the Owada incident and The Eye of Horus Murder Incident committed by the same suspect?

97
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:14,900
I'll call you later.

98
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:16,180
Wait,

99
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:27,950
A girl in my place is Mikuru, my sister.

100
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,250
Your sister?

101
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:39,500
I'll introduce you properly next time.

102
00:08:42,130 --> 00:08:43,750
Chief Editor Odaka

103
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:45,250
Excuse me.

104
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:50,080
Hello?

105
00:08:50,330 --> 00:08:51,900
Does Hiroki have brothers or sisters?

106
00:08:52,580 --> 00:08:55,650
No. I'm sure because I checked his family registry.

107
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:57,880
I'll send it by morning.

108
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:00,080
I'm going to take a shower.

109
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,150
You lie again...

110
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,350
GPS app

111
00:09:32,040 --> 00:09:33,530
Hiroki
Current location

112
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,850
Where is it?

113
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:51,200
Hey, we'll continue covering the follow-up to the police officer killing tomorrow.

114
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,330
Gather the materials.

115
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,250
It's probably the same suspect as in The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

116
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,630
What are your grounds for saying so?

117
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:00,500
Owada was the police officer in charge of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

118
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:03,180
Based on the timing of her murder, there's no doubt about it.

119
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:05,330
That reason isn't a valid basis.

120
00:10:05,350 --> 00:10:09,530
Listen, the police officer in charge was killed during the investigation of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident that is shaking the public!

121
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,600
Is there anything more sensational than this?!

122
00:10:11,730 --> 00:10:15,180
As of now, the news section hasn't mentioned any links between The Eye of Horus Murder Incident and this incident.

123
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:16,650
We can't broadcast it on our own.

124
00:10:16,700 --> 00:10:20,080
The public will pay attention because the news section hasn't covered it yet. Right, Tsutsui?

125
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,030
How about, "Does this incident have something to do with The Eye of Horus Murder Incident?"?

126
00:10:28,130 --> 00:10:31,550
Yes! You've started to understand what TV shows are.

127
00:10:31,650 --> 00:10:34,780
Rather than TV shows, I've started to understand how I should deal with Noda.

128
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,150
Anyway, I can't accept it!

129
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:44,980
Tsutsui and Kinoshita, find evidence that proves it's the same suspect.
Yes.

130
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,730
Don't you think Saki was acting a bit strange?

131
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,680
Tokyo General Central Hospital

132
00:10:56,330 --> 00:11:01,230
She is strict about compliance, but not that stubborn.

133
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:04,680
Makoto?

134
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,300
What? Ah, right...

135
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:12,500
Thank you for your hard work.

136
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:13,750
Did you find out anything?

137
00:11:14,180 --> 00:11:17,350
No. The media aren't allowed to go inside the hospital,

138
00:11:17,530 --> 00:11:21,750
and the police have taken all the security camera footage from this area.
I thought so.

139
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:26,180
No more argument, right? I'm happy.

140
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:30,550
I saw a reporter friend. I'll go ask him briefly.

141
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,730
All right.

142
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:37,500
Shall we go ask around as well?

143
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:46,230
Can any hospital staff access this device?

144
00:11:46,550 --> 00:11:51,050
No. Since it's managed by the ward, staff without permission can't access it.

145
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:54,380
I see. So, who has permission?

146
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,180
The head nurse has it.

147
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,130
Do you know where she is now?

148
00:12:03,450 --> 00:12:07,780
Are you nurses? Could you tell me anything about the incident?

149
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,050
Aoi!

150
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,330
You're here too.

151
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,700
We came here a little while ago. Were you on the night shift?

152
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:16,600
Yes. It was chaos.

153
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:18,050
Long time no see.

154
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:24,530
She is...
I know her.

155
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:28,750
Toko is Aoi's friend.

156
00:12:31,130 --> 00:12:33,430
She is my senior.

157
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:37,150
Ah, I see.

158
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:42,180
It was a rare situation. Were you panicked?

159
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:44,400
I felt a bit uncomfortable.

160
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:47,050
Because there was something you didn't want me to know about your past?

161
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,280
No such thing. I just felt uncomfortable.

162
00:12:54,700 --> 00:12:56,130
Are you done with work?

163
00:12:56,380 --> 00:13:02,480
Yes. We were supposed to finish at 9 am, but the police kept questioning us until now.

164
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:03,880
What questions did the police ask you?

165
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:09,900
Do you know why the police officer who was killed came to this hospital?

166
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:21,800
Sorry, but we've been told by the hospital not to say anything to the media.

167
00:13:22,930 --> 00:13:25,830
The atmosphere inside the hospital is pretty tense as well.

168
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:29,150
Well, that's natural.

169
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:32,450
Hiroki, the other day...

170
00:13:37,130 --> 00:13:38,050
What?

171
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:40,380
Nothing.

172
00:13:45,450 --> 00:13:47,650
We didn't find any new info.

173
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:50,900
It's not so easy to find evidence that it's the same suspect.

174
00:13:51,850 --> 00:13:53,630
I wonder if Masakiyo is all right.

175
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,630
Did you talk to him?
A little bit.

176
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,850
I see.

177
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,180
By the way, why was Owada killed?

178
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:12,550
Until now, the suspect has had a pattern and has acted according to it.

179
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:15,930
But why did the suspect suddenly commit such an irregular crime?

180
00:14:19,430 --> 00:14:20,730
Hiroki, what do you think?

181
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,630
I don't know.

182
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:32,650
At first, the suspect didn't intend to kill her but suddenly had to...

183
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:38,280
Maybe it was an unexpected crime, and the suspect didn't prepare contact lenses...

184
00:14:39,730 --> 00:14:41,200
It's possible.

185
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:52,650
You were gone when I woke up around 11 pm last night.

186
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:56,230
What were you doing after that?

187
00:14:57,850 --> 00:15:02,150
I went straight home. I had to write the article.

188
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:07,100
I see.

189
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:15,130
Masakiyo told me,

190
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,000
when he checked your family registry, you didn't have any brothers and sisters.

191
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:32,450
Makoto, come to my place now.

192
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:39,450
I'll answer all of your questions.

193
00:15:50,750 --> 00:15:52,450
Please come in. It's cramped.

194
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,030
Excuse me.

195
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:03,350
Mikuru, come here.

196
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:10,780
What? Hiro, why is she here?

197
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,500
I know you're having a doubt, but she truly is my sister.

198
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:15,950
Wait.

199
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:19,130
It's fine. I want to tell her the truth.

200
00:16:23,730 --> 00:16:27,150
We have different mothers.

201
00:16:36,750 --> 00:16:43,230
When I was 7 years old, a woman I'd never met came to my house with a little girl.

202
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:47,150
Why should I raise the child my husband had from an affair?

203
00:16:47,230 --> 00:16:49,250
If you want to complain, do it to your husband.

204
00:16:49,680 --> 00:16:57,730
When I was old enough to understand, my parents' relationship was bad, and my father had left home years ago.

205
00:16:58,180 --> 00:17:00,030
I can't do it anymore! I've had enough!

206
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:08,700
Mikuru's mother dumped Mikuru on my mother and disappeared.

207
00:17:10,080 --> 00:17:11,880
Here you are.

208
00:17:12,100 --> 00:17:14,680
Hiroki, it's your favorite dish, right? Eat as much as you want.

209
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:19,930
I'm hungry.

210
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:23,400
Shut up! What a shameless bastard!

211
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:26,350
My mother didn't take her to a nursing home.

212
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:33,900
But that didn't mean she properly took care of her either.

213
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:48,380
Hiroki, how was today's test?

214
00:17:48,750 --> 00:17:49,800
I got a perfect score.

215
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:53,100
Really? You're amazing!

216
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:55,680
Hiroki, you're a good boy.

217
00:17:56,530 --> 00:17:58,400
You're the only one on my side.

218
00:17:58,850 --> 00:18:00,180
I'll bring some soup.

219
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:06,330
It seemed that Mikuru was invisible to my mother.

220
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:11,250
Yes, my relative forced me to take care of her child.

221
00:18:11,330 --> 00:18:13,850
That's troublesome.

222
00:18:13,930 --> 00:18:15,930
That's right. It was all of a sudden.

223
00:18:21,800 --> 00:18:26,900
Even so, because of the neighbors, my mother made Mikuru receive compulsory education.

224
00:18:32,030 --> 00:18:35,550
You're old enough to take care of yourself by working part-time or doing whatever, right?

225
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,850
Please get out of my house ASAP.

226
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:43,080
Don't give me eyes like that.

227
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:46,080
You look just like my husband.

228
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:49,630
You should be grateful that I raised you until now.

229
00:18:49,750 --> 00:18:53,080
Mom, Mikuru is only 15 years old.

230
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:54,950
There's no way she can live on her own.

231
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:56,630
Hiroki, which side are you on?

232
00:18:57,030 --> 00:19:00,000
Because of her, your future may be ruined!

233
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:03,780
Do you realize how much I've done for you up until now?

234
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:12,230
Wait, Hiroki!

235
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:14,850
Are you going to abandon your mother?

236
00:19:16,100 --> 00:19:17,230
I'll come home occasionally.

237
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:19,800
Tell me what I did wrong.

238
00:19:20,830 --> 00:19:23,780
You're the most important to me.

239
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,100
I love you so much.

240
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:29,450
It's your fault!

241
00:19:30,230 --> 00:19:32,330
If you hadn't come to this house in the first place!

242
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:33,630
I'm sorry.

243
00:19:33,780 --> 00:19:37,330
Mom, I'm sorry.

244
00:19:42,150 --> 00:19:50,600
The year Mikuru entered high school, we left my mom's house and have been living together ever since.

245
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:05,900
I mourn my mother's death, but I haven't forgiven her.

246
00:20:09,050 --> 00:20:10,850
What my mother did to Mikuru...

247
00:20:12,750 --> 00:20:15,730
Or should I say what my mother didn't do to Mikuru?

248
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:20,950
I believe it definitely deserves to be punished.

249
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:30,450
The sin of doing nothing is harder to uncover than the sin of doing something.

250
00:20:35,330 --> 00:20:41,980
Looking back, I think everything my mother did may have been for the sake of getting revenge on her husband.

251
00:20:47,050 --> 00:20:48,680
You don't have to be so emotional.

252
00:20:49,630 --> 00:20:56,680
Sorry. I couldn't stop crying when I realized how hard you've fought to survive.

253
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:01,050
Do you believe his story?

254
00:21:04,580 --> 00:21:05,880
So, you believe him...

255
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:19,280
What happened to you guys is something only you can understand, but I can understand that you've tried your best to live.

256
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:28,150
I'm sorry I suspect you guys for no good reason.

257
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:36,950
Hiro is the only person I can rely on.

258
00:21:40,230 --> 00:21:48,400
Hiro worked a part-time job, earned money, and made me go to high school.

259
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:59,380
Hiro has been the only one to protect me since I was a kid.

260
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:08,050
I felt like you may destroy this life.

261
00:22:11,950 --> 00:22:16,600
I'm sorry for entering here without permission the other day.

262
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:25,700
I'm sorry for intruding on your life without respect.

263
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,830
By the way, Mikuru, it's about time for you to become independent.

264
00:22:41,700 --> 00:22:42,600
I know.

265
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:47,780
You have more questions for me, right?

266
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:55,030
Go ahead and ask me anything. I'll answer them properly.

267
00:23:04,130 --> 00:23:11,800
You know the suspect of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident is obsessed with blood, right?

268
00:23:15,630 --> 00:23:22,530
I heard that you were practicing taking blood while you were dating Toko.

269
00:23:23,550 --> 00:23:27,180
It was just out of curiosity.

270
00:23:31,230 --> 00:23:34,850
What about you wanted the blood from your guest when you were working at a night bar?

271
00:23:36,750 --> 00:23:40,250
I said that because I wanted to scare her.

272
00:23:41,450 --> 00:23:42,400
Scare her?

273
00:23:42,930 --> 00:23:48,350
I was pissed off because she seemed to think she could ask me for anything as long as she paid me.

274
00:23:52,130 --> 00:23:57,030
But I shouldn't have done that. Because I was the one making my guests think that way.

275
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:02,450
Do you still keep in touch with your father?

276
00:24:04,630 --> 00:24:13,250
No. I saw him for the first time in years at the trial 10 years ago.

277
00:24:14,900 --> 00:24:18,200
To be honest, I felt he was a stranger whom I couldn't remember what he looked like.

278
00:24:19,830 --> 00:24:22,150
I don't know his whereabouts after he got released.

279
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,400
Of course, I hadn't seen him until now.

280
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:30,130
When I was searching for his whereabouts, he suddenly appeared in front of me the other day.

281
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:36,230
One more question.

282
00:24:39,600 --> 00:24:41,300
What was the blood that was in the fridge?

283
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:49,780
Ah, that was fresh blood from softshell turtles.

284
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,030
Softshell turtles?

285
00:24:53,430 --> 00:24:57,850
Since Mikuru was anemic, I bought it online. But she wouldn't try it at all.

286
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:02,780
It's gross! Fresh blood from turtles! You should give me tablets instead.

287
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:04,600
It was very expensive!

288
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:09,300
Hiro, you tried it, right? That's why your skin is so smooth.

289
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:10,980
Stop it.

290
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:39,880
It's not too bad.

291
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,830
Is it okay for you to be wandering around here?

292
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,680
Horus has started to lose control.

293
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:49,700
That's unexpected, right?

294
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,800
Isn't it about time?

295
00:25:53,000 --> 00:25:54,000
Not yet.

296
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:58,530
How much longer are you going to protect your son?

297
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:06,900
I'm grateful to you. I'll return the favor someday.

298
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:17,200
Hiroki, you've been living to protect somebody, right?

299
00:26:21,850 --> 00:26:23,130
I'm sorry for the other day.

300
00:26:24,230 --> 00:26:29,050
I blamed you, saying that you were pretending to be worried or acting like it was all staged.

301
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:36,600
You're really trying to protect me as well, right?

302
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:43,280
But don't worry. Everybody is a strong person.

303
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:48,050
So, you can protect yourself.

304
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:55,780
Wait a second, I told you to protect you, didn't I?

305
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:05,480
I'll protect you in my own way.

306
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:12,000
I'll protect both you and everything you cherish.

307
00:27:20,650 --> 00:27:21,550
Come!

308
00:27:32,780 --> 00:27:38,050
Thank you. I take your feelings.

309
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:42,380
Am I that unreliable?

310
00:28:05,990 --> 00:28:10,880
The Eye of Horus Murder Incident had a prologue
A strange coincidence with the incident from 10 years ago...
Shitara Hiroki

311
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,250
Toko,

312
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:22,400
Ah, I'm sorry. I didn't intend to scare you.
Sorry.

313
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,650
Can I join you?

314
00:28:28,130 --> 00:28:29,330
Well...

315
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:33,850
Thank you.

316
00:28:39,430 --> 00:28:40,330
Hello?

317
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:44,600
What's going on?

318
00:28:48,430 --> 00:28:55,400
Is it true that the suspect of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident is obsessed with blood?

319
00:28:56,850 --> 00:28:58,850
It seems there's a theory like that.

320
00:28:59,630 --> 00:29:01,250
I see.

321
00:29:03,830 --> 00:29:05,380
Is there anything on your mind?

322
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:09,350
I just remembered something.

323
00:29:10,580 --> 00:29:19,850
Right before Hiroki quit his part-time job as a security guard, there were frequent discrepancies in the number of blood products in the hospital.

324
00:29:21,830 --> 00:29:27,050
As soon as the internal investigation started, he quit his job.

325
00:29:30,830 --> 00:29:32,730
I hadn't realized it until now,

326
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:40,180
but when the police asked me if Hiroki was a patient of Hepatitis C, I thought...

327
00:29:43,550 --> 00:29:51,650
If that's the case, I thought Hiroki may have stolen the blood products and transfused them into himself.

328
00:29:53,830 --> 00:29:57,080
Hepatitis C can't be cured by a blood transfusion.

329
00:29:57,850 --> 00:30:04,200
But it's true that Hiroki was unusually interested in drawing blood.

330
00:30:07,080 --> 00:30:14,650
I haven't told you, but I saw Hiroki in the hospital several times.

331
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,500
He was sitting at the reception for the medical checkup.

332
00:30:20,430 --> 00:30:26,450
He wore a cap and glasses. He didn't seem to be strange.

333
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:33,630
Hiroki isn't the suspect, right?

334
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:40,880
Have you told anybody about this?

335
00:30:42,650 --> 00:30:43,980
Not yet.

336
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:49,030
Me neither.

337
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,050
Could you keep this secret?

338
00:30:57,180 --> 00:31:02,800
Please don't tell anybody about this.

339
00:31:12,250 --> 00:31:15,180
Based on the suspect's irregular killing of Owada,

340
00:31:15,350 --> 00:31:20,200
the suspect is probably quite panicked since the police have noticed the common link between the victims.

341
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,230
It must be before committing a murder.

342
00:31:27,850 --> 00:31:30,580
From a statistical perspective, the blood from the victims is all healthy.

343
00:31:31,180 --> 00:31:36,100
If the suspect wanted healthy blood, he would have to take blood before killing the victims.

344
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:44,430
There's no doubt that the person's obsession with blood is one of the key clues to identifying the suspect.

345
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,350
I'm getting hungry even at times like this.

346
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,130
There's one exception.

347
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,880
I still can't believe it.

348
00:32:12,580 --> 00:32:15,050
Itsuki,
Kayo,

349
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:16,300
Candies,

350
00:32:16,580 --> 00:32:17,700
Rice balls,

351
00:32:17,780 --> 00:32:20,750
A son's happiness comes from a mother's happiness.

352
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:22,430
You're a nice man!

353
00:32:26,630 --> 00:32:28,850
I could have seen her when I came here...

354
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:34,680
Can I let him know the schedule of her funeral?

355
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:40,580
Well, it's mediocre.

356
00:32:40,980 --> 00:32:42,780
What's wrong? It's unusual for you.

357
00:32:43,550 --> 00:32:44,380
I'm sorry.

358
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:48,030
Can you investigate that hospital murder incident?

359
00:32:48,730 --> 00:32:52,400
It seems the police believe it's the same suspect as The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

360
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:59,100
Since the police took all the documents, I don't think I can find any new info.

361
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:03,630
It's your specialty to turn things like that into an article with new angles, right?

362
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:10,600
I'll give you an even bigger scoop than that soon.

363
00:33:18,600 --> 00:33:24,100
It seems the police believe the suspect is the one who's been coming and going to this hospital for some time.

364
00:33:24,300 --> 00:33:25,900
Does that mean the suspect is a hospital staff member?

365
00:33:26,150 --> 00:33:29,780
There're tons of people who come and go at the hospital. It doesn't have to be a hospital staff member.

366
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:35,080
And it seems all the victims of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident had taken medical checkups at this hospital.

367
00:33:35,280 --> 00:33:38,030
Oh, things are getting connected...

368
00:33:38,450 --> 00:33:40,800
For now, let's go with this story.
Rejected.

369
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:42,350
Why not?

370
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:49,900
I think the fact that a police officer investigating the incident was killed at the hospital, which is the new common link among the victims, will attract public attention.

371
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,230
Kinoshita, you're...

372
00:33:52,550 --> 00:33:53,980
Is this the kind of opinion you like?

373
00:33:55,100 --> 00:33:56,650
You're kind of annoying...

374
00:33:57,030 --> 00:34:00,630
Whatever, so...
Rejected.

375
00:34:00,850 --> 00:34:01,830
Why not?

376
00:34:01,900 --> 00:34:03,700
Because the news section hasn't covered it.

377
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,100
Don't you have anything else to say? I'm tired of hearing that!

378
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,830
But Saki, the show about The Eye of Horus Murder Incident, actually gets high viewer ratings.

379
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:13,230
We'd be better off taking a bold approach for the sake of our show.

380
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:15,780
This is an incident with a high impact.

381
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,280
Depending on the content of the show, it could incite public reaction.

382
00:34:19,600 --> 00:34:23,580
What would you do if the public starts to say, "You'll be killed if you take health checkups at this hospital"?

383
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:27,080
The hospital may sue us for reputational damage.

384
00:34:28,380 --> 00:34:32,550
As a company and as a show, we have no choice but to be cautious.

385
00:34:36,650 --> 00:34:38,480
Excuse me.

386
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:42,200
Yes. Thank you for your support.

387
00:34:42,850 --> 00:34:43,680
Hey, Tsutsui.

388
00:34:45,050 --> 00:34:48,200
Don't you have any ideas or opinions?

389
00:34:50,730 --> 00:34:51,700
Nothing.

390
00:34:55,350 --> 00:34:59,050
I'm sorry. My daughter got injured at school, so I'll leave earlier to take care of her.

391
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:01,200
Ah, that's not good. Please leave now.

392
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:04,000
I'm sorry. See you tomorrow.

393
00:35:04,130 --> 00:35:05,330
Thank you for your hard work.

394
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:07,780
Don't do anything on your own.
I know.

395
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:23,830
Hey, can we talk?

396
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:40,830
You have something to report to me, right?

397
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:49,600
Are you trying to avoid making your boyfriend look suspicious?

398
00:35:52,130 --> 00:35:53,450
Kinoshita, were you listening to our conversation?

399
00:35:54,500 --> 00:35:55,330
I'm sorry.

400
00:35:55,630 --> 00:35:56,580
Why did you snitch?

401
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,650
I asked him to keep an eye on you.

402
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:08,650
We, the media, have repeatedly invaded others' private lives.

403
00:36:12,280 --> 00:36:14,300
But when it comes to your people, do you try to hide the facts?

404
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,180
It's a typical mixing of public and private matters.

405
00:36:19,150 --> 00:36:23,800
Because I couldn't find any evidence for her story, I concluded it was just her imagination.

406
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:34,180
You always say that you want to be on the victim's side.

407
00:36:34,280 --> 00:36:37,380
But after all, you just love yourself who says those things.

408
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:43,480
So, what can you protect by doing that?

409
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:50,650
You're no longer the chief of the show of this incident.

410
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,230
I'm sorry. I...

411
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,050
That's fine. It's not your fault.

412
00:37:19,300 --> 00:37:20,130
Makoto,

413
00:37:27,050 --> 00:37:28,080
Thank you.

414
00:37:31,330 --> 00:37:32,880
What's wrong? You look so serious.

415
00:37:34,000 --> 00:37:36,900
Let's eat dinner together. Shall we order for Itsuki?

416
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,480
I think it's really strange.

417
00:37:46,630 --> 00:37:49,030
Makoto, you think Hiroki is strange as well, right?

418
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,400
I believe him.

419
00:37:56,350 --> 00:37:59,600
He grew up in a complicated family.

420
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,930
That's why he is just being misunderstood.

421
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,450
You're overdoing it.

422
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:10,050
You created a strange story by connecting the parts.

423
00:38:15,150 --> 00:38:18,600
Don't worry, I believe him.

424
00:38:20,650 --> 00:38:24,380
At the point of saying, "I believe him", you don't believe him.

425
00:38:25,930 --> 00:38:31,930
Because if you believe him from the bottom of your heart, you wouldn't think whether you believe him or not.

426
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,180
Makoto, you're being deceived by him.

427
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,500
I don't think so. You just don't understand.

428
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,750
I understand because I'm with Hiroki.

429
00:38:54,550 --> 00:39:03,300
Toko, Masakiyo, and the police...Everybody except you thinks Hiroki is strange.

430
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:08,200
Please wake up.

431
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:12,630
Is what 9 out of 10 people think the truth?

432
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:18,150
Is an opinion with only one supporter wrong?

433
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,300
The truth isn't decided by a majority vote.

434
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:26,130
You're too insensitive to notice.

435
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:28,550
What? When have I been too insensitive?

436
00:39:28,600 --> 00:39:30,980
You're always insensitive.

437
00:39:32,100 --> 00:39:35,400
How many years did it take for you to notice Masakiyo's feelings?

438
00:39:35,700 --> 00:39:38,930
It's roughly been over 12 years, right?

439
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:42,180
A newborn baby becomes 12 years old.

440
00:39:42,190 --> 00:39:43,270
Of course, it does.

441
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,700
Michael Jackson hit number one on the Billboard charts at the age of 11.

442
00:39:45,750 --> 00:39:47,000
So, what? What the hell are you talking about?

443
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:50,000
It's an example of how everybody has their own process of development.

444
00:39:50,280 --> 00:39:51,380
But you're,

445
00:39:51,430 --> 00:39:52,850
Because he didn't tell me!

446
00:39:53,450 --> 00:39:56,650
Masakiyo has never said anything like that until now.

447
00:39:57,130 --> 00:40:01,200
People don't say everything they're thinking.

448
00:40:02,130 --> 00:40:04,650
However, everybody except you has noticed,

449
00:40:04,680 --> 00:40:06,200
And my feeling as well...

450
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:09,480
What?

451
00:40:10,350 --> 00:40:11,580
Nothing.

452
00:40:12,430 --> 00:40:14,250
What were you about to say? I don't like your attitude.

453
00:40:14,750 --> 00:40:16,380
Aoi, you're insensitive as well!

454
00:40:16,930 --> 00:40:20,100
Excuse me? When and where was I being insensitive?

455
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,900
When you take pictures.

456
00:40:23,230 --> 00:40:27,630
You always stop us forcibly and take your personal pictures, right?

457
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,830
That's annoying. You can't read between the lines.

458
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:31,780
Then, why didn't you say something at that time?

459
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:34,050
People don't say everything they're thinking, right?

460
00:40:43,800 --> 00:40:55,550
No matter how many people share the same opinion, I believe Hiroki, whom I've seen myself, over the words of strangers who don't know him.

461
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,950
It's not a stranger's words.

462
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,830
It's the words of your friends and comrades.

463
00:41:07,330 --> 00:41:10,830
It's the words of people who care about you.

464
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:22,800
Even so, don't none of their words, not even mine, reach you?

465
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,850
Is Hiroki the only one you can see?

466
00:41:49,280 --> 00:41:52,050
Fine, do whatever you want.

467
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,630
Wow, what's wrong?

468
00:42:51,780 --> 00:42:52,880
Do me a favor.

469
00:42:57,100 --> 00:42:58,380
What's wrong all of a sudden?

470
00:42:59,650 --> 00:43:01,150
I have something I want to talk to you about.

471
00:43:04,230 --> 00:43:05,430
It's about Hiroki.

472
00:43:26,530 --> 00:43:29,280
If you don't mind, would you take this watch?

473
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:36,830
Are you sure? This watch is a gift from you to her, right?

474
00:43:40,630 --> 00:43:44,450
My mother said that when she wore this watch, her detective instincts got sharper.

475
00:43:45,880 --> 00:43:50,880
So, if you accept this watch, my mother will be happy.

476
00:44:03,050 --> 00:44:08,580
I really appreciate your mother's support for me.

477
00:44:11,400 --> 00:44:12,680
But I couldn't return a favor to her.

478
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:19,380
My mother often talked about you.

479
00:44:21,450 --> 00:44:29,550
"Justice alone can't solve the incidents. It's difficult to teach him that"

480
00:44:32,180 --> 00:44:35,450
However, she looked very happy.

481
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:50,000
Did you know my mother actually loved spicy food?

482
00:44:50,950 --> 00:44:53,750
So, she doesn't eat candies herself.

483
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,250
Really? What's that?!

484
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:21,950
I'm sorry, I couldn't protect your mother.

485
00:45:24,750 --> 00:45:28,980
I'm sorry.

486
00:45:31,100 --> 00:45:42,880
My mother was a police officer, so she always told me to be prepared for the worst scenario.

487
00:45:45,380 --> 00:45:51,750
Please arrest the suspect.

488
00:46:06,730 --> 00:46:08,380
He is Itsuki, a deliveryman.

489
00:46:09,800 --> 00:46:11,450
He got along well with your mother.

490
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:29,180
She always said I looked like you and was very nice to me.

491
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:32,630
I've heard a little about you from my mother.

492
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,930
But I don't think we look much alike.

493
00:46:47,930 --> 00:46:54,450
I'll never forget your mother.

494
00:47:01,100 --> 00:47:02,450
Thank you.

495
00:47:19,530 --> 00:47:20,430
Salute!

496
00:47:46,800 --> 00:47:52,700
Noda, please allow me to handle this incident.

497
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:01,680
Are you sure?
Yes.

498
00:48:24,330 --> 00:48:25,730
You'd better not go.

499
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:34,000
Don't worry, I won't talk about that.

500
00:48:39,200 --> 00:48:39,980
Mikuru?

501
00:48:44,730 --> 00:48:45,400
Mikuru,

502
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,700
New development in The Eye of Horus Murder Incident
Suspicion falls on a famous journalist
Uncover his true face

503
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:38,450
We've gathered a lot of testimonies that suggest you could be the suspect.

504
00:49:41,850 --> 00:49:45,750
Aren't you the suspect?

505
00:49:59,970 --> 00:50:14,980
Next episode

506
00:50:00,580 --> 00:50:05,730
Why has the suspect started a series of murders now, 10 years after my mother was brutally killed?

507
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,050
The fateful day, June 6th

508
00:50:08,150 --> 00:50:12,780
I'm the only one who can't see it...

509
00:50:12,080 --> 00:50:15,000
The worst ending
