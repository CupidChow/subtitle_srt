1
00:00:04,130 --> 00:00:06,430
I'll give them to you. Keep them, and you'll be happy.

2
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:07,580
Thank you.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,680
Wait a second. Did you realize that girl was me?

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:16,400
There aren't many people who say such a lie if you can grab 3 petals at once...", with a sparkling smile, right?

5
00:00:16,630 --> 00:00:19,450
The serial killing shaking the public, known as The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

6
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:23,180
As the predicted date of the next crime, June 6th, is approaching...

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:28,230
Is it true that you've been lacking enthusiasm for The Eye of Horus Murder Incident lately because you wanted to get back into the news section?

8
00:00:28,330 --> 00:00:29,430
But this is who I am.

9
00:00:29,530 --> 00:00:31,480
People who haven't shown their real selves...

10
00:00:32,450 --> 00:00:36,100
Their intentions get entangled.

11
00:00:36,230 --> 00:00:40,180
You should accept the facts in front of you as they are.

12
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:41,280
Everything starts from that.

13
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:43,430
Makoto...I love you.

14
00:00:43,650 --> 00:00:45,830
It's the wrong time to say that.

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,200
The truth that I must face is...

16
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:02,980
I told you not to move.

17
00:01:09,100 --> 00:01:10,630
Don't you like tomatoes? I'll eat it for you.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,480
Hey, I'm keeping them last!
Are you?

19
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:18,130
I want to keep the important things for last.

20
00:01:18,550 --> 00:01:19,450
That's surprising.

21
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,180
I've had a habit of keeping everything since I was a kid.

22
00:01:23,330 --> 00:01:26,580
I kept my precious things in a box.

23
00:01:26,950 --> 00:01:30,350
And I forgot about it, and I cried a lot.

24
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:31,630
That's cute.

25
00:01:31,750 --> 00:01:33,100
Yes, I'm cute.

26
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:39,980
Why...?

27
00:01:42,580 --> 00:01:48,830
You should take a video. This is a big scoop.

28
00:02:05,180 --> 00:02:06,330
No way...

29
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:10,900
I'm sorry.

30
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,430
Why?

31
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:28,930
I'm sorry for lying to you so many times.

32
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:41,680
But, Makoto, I...

33
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:13,150
Are you all right?

34
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:15,950
Makoto, why are you here?

35
00:03:16,350 --> 00:03:20,680
The suspect is running away. Set up emergency deployment in the surrounding area!

36
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,350
Makoto, what happened?

37
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,380
The victim is still alive.

38
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:36,930
You installed a GPS in Shitara's phone...Does that mean you suspected him?

39
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,880
I've always trusted him... but I've also always suspected him.

40
00:03:54,880 --> 00:03:56,350
Thank you for your hard work.

41
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:02,650
Makoto, are you all right?

42
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,380
Yes, I was told that we could decide whether or not to broadcast this video.

43
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:07,730
I'm not talking about that. I'm worried about you!

44
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:13,150
Hey, Tsutsui, be on tomorrow's live show.

45
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,730
No, I'll never allow that.

46
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:19,930
Noda, that's not a good idea. In the worst case, Makoto will be targeted for criticism.

47
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,500
I'm fine. I'll be on the show tomorrow.

48
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,850
I don't think so. You don't seem calm enough to speak on TV right now.

49
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,100
Makoto, you need to rest.

50
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:30,030
This is my scoop. I'll take care of it!

51
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:37,400
I understood. However, I won't allow you to be on TV.

52
00:04:39,850 --> 00:04:40,980
What about Shitara's whereabouts?

53
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:45,650
It's believed that he's escaped towards the Tamagawa area, but his whereabouts are still unknown.

54
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:49,780
We'll issue a nationwide manhunt for Shitara Hiroki on charges of attempted murder!

55
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,980
From now on, we'll switch to a public investigation!

56
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:00,950
Makoto, you should eat something.

57
00:05:02,950 --> 00:05:04,150
Here's the food.

58
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:17,230
The MPD has just issued a nationwide manhunt for Hiroki Shitara on charges of attempted murder in The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

59
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,980
Nobody knows the right answer to their own life.

60
00:05:22,480 --> 00:05:27,350
However, It's clear that my life isn't the right answer.

61
00:05:28,850 --> 00:05:34,830
If it's too late to correct it, the only option is to end it with the truth.

62
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:42,230
Koi wa Yami (Love is Darkness)

63
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:48,930
You should take a video. This is a big scoop.

64
00:05:54,430 --> 00:05:55,500
Why...?

65
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,830
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:03,750 --> 00:06:07,280
This is the footage taken around 11:15 pm last night, right?

67
00:06:07,530 --> 00:06:16,000
Yes, the director who worked with suspect Shitara just before shooting this scene stated that there was nothing suspicious about him during their work.

68
00:06:16,430 --> 00:06:23,250
The victim, a woman in her 30s, survived but suffered a head injury and remains in a coma.

69
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:27,750
He was the suspect after all!
Didn't that director, who was working with him, notice anything?
This director let the suspect run away last time as well, right?
She should've saved her first before shooting the video!

70
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,030
The suspect Shitara is being running away, and...

71
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:32,380
I'm very sorry.

72
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,150
That director has nothing to do with The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

73
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,900
That broadcast was done with the cooperation of the police investigation.

74
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,830
The responsibility for letting the suspect run away is...

75
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:41,330
This is chaos.

76
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,950
Episode 9

77
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:46,030
We can expect high ratings...

78
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:48,130
Yes, excuse me.

79
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,050
Makoto, don't answer the phone.

80
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:54,580
I need to talk to you for a moment.

81
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,300
Makoto, you should take some time off to rest.

82
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,880
Because I had a personal relationship with the suspect?

83
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:12,280
No. It's not your fault.

84
00:07:12,550 --> 00:07:13,700
If that's the case, why?

85
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:18,100
It's for protecting your mental health.

86
00:07:21,100 --> 00:07:27,700
Right now, you're straining on your nerves, but if you keep living like this. I think you'll break down.

87
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:34,400
Can't you trust me anymore?

88
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:37,980
I can.

89
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:51,950
I've made up my mind to do whatever I can for my team after you showed me your determination.

90
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:57,750
Don't worry, I promise to protect your position.

91
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:02,180
All right?
Yes.

92
00:08:13,980 --> 00:08:17,850
It seems that he knew this was going to happen.

93
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:23,830
It's been 3 days since his escape, but the whereabouts of suspect Shitara are still unknown.

94
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:31,400
The MPD has expanded the search area from the Tama area to the entire Tokyo area, and...

95
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,980
I'm the one who let the suspect escape.

96
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:42,850
Don't check them.

97
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,780
Why do you have to have responsibility just because you were working with him?

98
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:50,330
Well, I expected this would happen.

99
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,180
They blame you for letting the suspect escape twice,

100
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:55,080
but how can you capture the suspect who is holding a knife?

101
00:08:55,830 --> 00:09:00,900
I wonder if those people who blame you based on what Shitara said actually watched the show properly.

102
00:09:01,930 --> 00:09:03,050
You're really pissed off.

103
00:09:03,150 --> 00:09:08,280
Because they know nothing! It's annoying!

104
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:15,680
There's nothing I can do. No one knows what's true and what's lie.

105
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:24,250
Even I, who have been with him the whole time, don't know that.

106
00:09:26,980 --> 00:09:29,900
Hey, are you crying now?

107
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:33,000
No, I won't cry. So, you can cry.

108
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:37,150
I can't cry...because I don't feel it's real.

109
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:45,730
I still wonder if the scene I saw back then was just a dream.

110
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:57,080
However, I wonder if the time I spent with Hiroki was just a dream or an illusion.

111
00:10:00,230 --> 00:10:04,900
Makoto, do you think Shitara is the suspect?

112
00:10:09,330 --> 00:10:10,430
Because it's obvious...

113
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:14,400
Right.

114
00:10:16,850 --> 00:10:18,200
What's wrong?

115
00:10:20,050 --> 00:10:25,530
I somehow feel he controls us the way he wants...

116
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,180
Did you find something at his house?

117
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:34,900
No. His place looked like a simple bachelor pad.

118
00:10:35,630 --> 00:10:37,000
I see.

119
00:10:38,350 --> 00:10:44,350
Makoto, you mentioned to me before that Shitara lived with a woman, right?

120
00:10:45,500 --> 00:10:48,150
That was my mistake.

121
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,000
I see.

122
00:10:52,550 --> 00:10:56,480
There was no needle mark on the 6th victim.

123
00:10:57,230 --> 00:10:59,480
Who called 911?

124
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:03,450
It was from an unregistered phone, so we couldn't identify the person.

125
00:11:07,380 --> 00:11:15,180
Well, actually, I spoke with Hiroki alone the other day.

126
00:11:16,950 --> 00:11:20,500
I'm sorry, but I really thought he was dangerous.

127
00:11:20,700 --> 00:11:23,280
And at that time...

128
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:33,350
Keep an eye on Makoto so she won't be killed.

129
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,330
What the hell is that?

130
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,250
It's strange, right?

131
00:12:06,060 --> 00:12:09,300
Breaking News
Exclusive memoir of suspect Shitara Hiroki!
The reason why I started The Eye of Horus Murder Incident

132
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,700
I'm being chased by the police right now.

133
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:19,780
Because I became a nationwide manhunt as the suspect of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

134
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:24,580
I can say for sure, I'm the suspect.

135
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:32,750
The Eye of Horus Murder Incident that I planned and carried out,

136
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:38,800
I'm glad that so many people have shown such great interest in it.

137
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:45,650
From now on, I intend to answer all of your curiosities.

138
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:50,400
It's the real one. Shitara Hiroki sent this to me.

139
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:57,950
The beginning of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident was the murder incident of Shitara Kumiko on July 20th, 2015.

140
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,980
Replace the front-page article with Shitara Hiroki's memoir!

141
00:13:01,750 --> 00:13:08,400
This incident is considered to have already been resolved with the arrest of my father, Shitara Kanji.

142
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:14,230
However, I'm the true suspect of this incident.

143
00:13:15,230 --> 00:13:18,680
My mother was an arrogant person with a huge pride.

144
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:24,000
She judges others by her own standards and looks down on them.

145
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,030
She is a sinful person.

146
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:33,180
When I killed my mother, I felt an elevation of spirit like I had never felt before.

147
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:38,980
That day, I awakened to an irresistible urge to kill, unlike anything I had ever felt before.

148
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,930
The article includes such graphic descriptions.

149
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:45,780
Does this mean he broke free from his mother's curse?

150
00:13:46,150 --> 00:13:56,950
He seemed to choose to kill only women who had careers, high pride, and a strong desire for self-expression, like his mother.

151
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:03,780
The fingerprint on the USB memory sent to Weekly Shinryu matched that of Shitara Hiroki.

152
00:14:05,830 --> 00:14:10,130
He chose women who had high pride and a strong desire for self-expression,

153
00:14:10,230 --> 00:14:14,580
The only word his article gave me was "Discomfort".

154
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,500
The new article was posted!

155
00:14:24,130 --> 00:14:27,580
Do you know the true meaning of "The Eye of Horus"?

156
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,680
It means the eye that sees through the truth.

157
00:14:33,330 --> 00:14:42,250
Overall, those who lack the eye to see the true essence tend to receive false evaluations and pose as successful individuals.

158
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:52,680
The reason I put the contact lens in the victim's eyes was to give such foolish people the eye to see through the truth.

159
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:56,300
The postmarks are all different.

160
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,850
They're all over Tokyo, so we can't find any patterns.

161
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:07,150
To the fellow beings who truly deserve to be valued,

162
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,280
I'll be the guidepost for all of you.

163
00:15:11,380 --> 00:15:12,730
Suspect Shitara, unstoppable provocation

164
00:15:13,850 --> 00:15:17,000
I'm a sinful person.

165
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,380
I can't help but enjoy killing people.

166
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:27,180
Nobody can stop me.

167
00:15:28,630 --> 00:15:34,100
I'll punish those who defile this society with false eyes.

168
00:15:34,630 --> 00:15:42,130
God of the new world has arrived
The police are incompetent
He is a very provocative suspect
He is crazy

169
00:15:39,900 --> 00:15:42,680
I think he has a strong hatred for his mother.

170
00:15:42,950 --> 00:15:46,200
It could be interpreted as attachment disorder or being a mama's boy.

171
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:59,230
I chose the target by hacking the hospital's database to find women who had healthy blood.

172
00:15:53,790 --> 00:15:56,280
Exclusive 4th article from suspect Shitara Hiroki
The full story of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident

173
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:07,230
I checked the locations of the security cameras, and I tracked the target's patterns of behavior to calculate the time they arrived home.

174
00:16:11,450 --> 00:16:12,430
Don't kill me...

175
00:16:57,150 --> 00:17:00,880
Itsuki! I'm sorry.

176
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:04,730
Sorry, I meant to cheer you up, but I surprised you instead.

177
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,500
I'm sorry too.

178
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:14,600
Makoto, I can't forgive Hiroki for truly being the suspect.

179
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:24,650
He betrayed and hurt you. He killed Kayo too.

180
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,750
Itsuki,

181
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:36,530
Is it my fault? Is it sexual harassment?

182
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:37,530
I don't think so.

183
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:39,430
Who is he?

184
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:41,550
He is Itsuki, a deliveryman.

185
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:43,100
Ah, you often talk about him...

186
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,630
Nice to meet you.

187
00:17:45,780 --> 00:17:46,700
By the way, why are you here?

188
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:50,780
Ah, yes, this is for you.

189
00:17:51,650 --> 00:17:54,280
This is a delivery from Masakiyo to you.

190
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,550
What? From Masakiyo?

191
00:17:55,750 --> 00:17:57,480
Is he such a thoughtful man?

192
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,450
And one more thing...

193
00:18:05,550 --> 00:18:07,950
Ah, nothing. I have to go.

194
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:13,700
I called you earlier.

195
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,630
Sorry, I was falling asleep.

196
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:18,500
Ah, yes. I'm sorry.

197
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,600
May I borrow a duplicate key?

198
00:18:23,130 --> 00:18:24,600
Because it'd be trouble if anything happened to you.

199
00:18:24,930 --> 00:18:26,050
You're worrying too much.

200
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,950
There's no harm in worrying too much.

201
00:18:29,580 --> 00:18:31,050
All right.

202
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,850
But you're worrying too much.

203
00:18:34,550 --> 00:18:37,580
I'd never enter the room without your permission.

204
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,200
I'll let you know when I come here.

205
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,300
I'm aware.

206
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,800
Wow, it looks delicious.

207
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,040
It's Kimbap!

208
00:18:45,050 --> 00:18:47,130
However, isn't it too much?
Indeed.

209
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:53,180
It's from Masakiyo.

210
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,200
Komine Masakiyo
You're going to see Makoto, right? I ordered dinner for 2.

211
00:18:54,750 --> 00:18:56,200
He knows us very well.

212
00:19:04,100 --> 00:19:06,950
Utsumi Aoi
Thanks. I love Kimbap!

213
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:11,630
That's why I ordered it.

214
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:30,750
Noda, what's going on?

215
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:38,150
It's the other news.

216
00:19:39,930 --> 00:19:41,850
We're falling into his trap.

217
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:47,080
We pay attention to him and are being manipulated by him.

218
00:19:47,930 --> 00:19:49,950
We keep broadcasting about him one after another.

219
00:19:52,250 --> 00:19:56,080
The more news I watch about him, the more I lose my sense of reality.

220
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:03,280
The articles... written by Shitara Hiroki.

221
00:20:05,450 --> 00:20:07,250
It's full of a sense of discomfort.

222
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:11,330
I feel like it's the news about someone I've never met.

223
00:20:13,030 --> 00:20:18,730
A lot of people are analyzing and talking about him.

224
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:26,480
Shitara Hiroki, I know, doesn't exist anywhere in this world.

225
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:36,030
I wonder if his existence was fake and everything he said was a total lie.

226
00:20:42,130 --> 00:20:43,830
Why are you dressed like that today?

227
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:47,230
I'm going to Hakata.
Hakata?

228
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,680
Today is the anniversary of the death of a victim from a cold case I was chasing.

229
00:20:53,750 --> 00:20:56,700
I was in Hakata at the time when this incident occurred.

230
00:20:57,580 --> 00:21:00,900
I want to greet the bereaved family. I'll never forget this day.

231
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,100
Noda, you're not the man who just wants to brag about your glory days.

232
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:09,880
Sorry, my inner thoughts came out accidentally...

233
00:21:11,830 --> 00:21:17,030
Whether the suspect is arrested or not, if there's no development in the incident, it stops being broadcasted.

234
00:21:18,130 --> 00:21:19,300
It can't be helped.

235
00:21:20,530 --> 00:21:22,830
New incidents occur every day.

236
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:25,200
The incidents that don't bring high ratings aren't broadcasted on TV.

237
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:29,950
However, for the bereaved family, "It can't be helped" isn't acceptable.

238
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:33,050
Is that why you're always saying to make the show more exciting?

239
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,800
A 100% lie can't exist in this world.

240
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:50,300
Even though Shitara Hiroki is trying to show you a 100% false image of himself, the real him must exist somewhere.

241
00:21:50,930 --> 00:21:53,300
He can't completely hide his true self, and it overflows.

242
00:21:56,180 --> 00:22:02,200
Even though 99% of him is false, you must have witnessed 1% of his true self.

243
00:22:10,250 --> 00:22:12,530
This is trash! I don't want it.

244
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,080
That's not trash!

245
00:22:14,830 --> 00:22:16,230
Hey, Noda.

246
00:22:26,750 --> 00:22:27,550
What are you doing?

247
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:31,500
Kinoshita, don't scare me.

248
00:22:35,300 --> 00:22:37,700
I saw something the other day.

249
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:47,030
What? Does Noda know Shitara Kanji?

250
00:22:47,130 --> 00:22:51,780
Yes. Since they went their separate ways, I chased Shitara Kanji.

251
00:22:52,780 --> 00:22:56,600
I cornered him, but then, he pulled out a knife.

252
00:22:56,750 --> 00:22:58,350
What? A knife?!

253
00:22:58,430 --> 00:23:03,050
So, I told him, "If you want to stab me, go ahead". Then, he hesitated and ran away.

254
00:23:03,430 --> 00:23:07,680
Really? Itsuki, you're a brave man.

255
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,400
Are you playing a detective?

256
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:16,780
Not at all. Accidentally...I'm sorry!

257
00:23:24,530 --> 00:23:25,900
I have to go.

258
00:23:26,630 --> 00:23:28,300
Kinoshita, I'll leave the rest to you.

259
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:40,000
Kinoshita, what's up?

260
00:23:40,180 --> 00:23:43,180
You're going to do the interview, right? I'm going with you.

261
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,080
But I'm on leave right now.

262
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,030
Don't worry, Saki told me to check on you.

263
00:23:53,550 --> 00:23:57,080
By the way, Shitara is doing the same thing as he did back then.

264
00:23:57,850 --> 00:24:01,680
It's easy to control public opinion.

265
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:10,080
When somebody makes a story, it begins spreading as the truth.

266
00:24:12,630 --> 00:24:19,130
I wonder why he is creating the story that Shitara Hiroki is a notorious suspect of the century.

267
00:24:21,280 --> 00:24:23,980
Kinoshita, don't you think he is the suspect?

268
00:24:24,430 --> 00:24:28,350
No. Because that memoir doesn't seem like Shitara.

269
00:24:34,780 --> 00:24:38,430
Breaking News
Exclusive 5th article from suspect Shitara Hiroki
Draining the victims' blood was a ritual to replace the blood of my hateful mother

270
00:24:36,950 --> 00:24:42,450
The healthy blood taken from the victims was transfused into me.

271
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:45,830
My mother had Hepatitis C.

272
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:54,730
I'd healed naturally, but I wanted to dilute the blood of my hateful mother even a little bit.

273
00:24:55,230 --> 00:24:58,850
Transfused into him? Really?

274
00:24:59,580 --> 00:25:02,780
Well, at this point, I wouldn't be surprised no matter what he does.

275
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:11,530
If the 6th victim is awake, we might be able to learn something, but...

276
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,730
So, you're Tsutsui Makoto.

277
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:24,430
I've been curious about what kind of girl Hiroki's girlfriend was.

278
00:25:25,930 --> 00:25:27,230
It's a motherly feeling.

279
00:25:32,950 --> 00:25:36,000
Odaka, what do you think about his articles?

280
00:25:37,700 --> 00:25:40,530
Is it possible that someone other than Hiroki wrote them?

281
00:25:43,730 --> 00:25:44,800
Check this.

282
00:25:45,450 --> 00:25:48,780
His writing habit and choice of words...

283
00:25:49,280 --> 00:25:52,400
This was undoubtedly written by him.

284
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,330
I see.

285
00:25:56,250 --> 00:26:00,480
However, I feel like the him in these articles is a stranger.

286
00:26:02,380 --> 00:26:04,150
Odaka, what kind of person was he to you?

287
00:26:05,050 --> 00:26:08,680
You're the one who made Hiroki a journalist when he was working at a night bar, right?

288
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,830
At first, I thought he had a good intuition.

289
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:19,780
He was good at listening and knew how to proceed with the conversation.

290
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,780
I thought he was suited to be a journalist.

291
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:24,080
But above all...

292
00:26:25,400 --> 00:26:30,830
Senior, it's a crime to make yourself attractive to her and swindle her money.

293
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:37,880
It hurts!

294
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,380
The charge of assault has been added.

295
00:26:44,030 --> 00:26:45,530
That camera footage is evidence.

296
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:48,450
An ugly bitch!

297
00:26:48,750 --> 00:26:50,730
He had a fearless sense of justice.

298
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:55,480
At that time, I was convinced he'd be an excellent journalist.

299
00:26:57,230 --> 00:27:02,930
All of Hiroki's scoops are staged, and he is considered an incompetent journalist, right?

300
00:27:03,650 --> 00:27:08,280
But he kept getting many scoops even before The Eye of Horus Murder Incident,

301
00:27:09,450 --> 00:27:14,750
He was undoubtedly an excellent journalist with both beliefs and passion.

302
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,630
That's why I'm so upset.

303
00:27:20,950 --> 00:27:27,280
I may be told that I have no right to be upset, but I'm upset.

304
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,530
I understand how you feel.

305
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:35,580
Anyway, I feel a sense of discomfort about his articles.

306
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,000
Is it the article that he transfuses the victims' blood into himself?

307
00:27:39,350 --> 00:27:46,750
Yes. I heard that transfusing someone's blood directly can cause a state of shock.

308
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:49,430
Really?

309
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:58,050
If he did that once or twice, he may have been lucky. But if he did that every time, he'd be dead by now.

310
00:27:59,220 --> 00:28:03,180
Moriuchi Family
Kumiko, 43 years old

311
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:27,230
Kinoshita
I'm searching for Hiroki's whereabouts,
it's no luck. I have no info at all

312
00:28:29,550 --> 00:28:32,180
Got it
Thank you.

313
00:28:45,550 --> 00:28:46,950
He said this wasn't trash...

314
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,880
This is it.

315
00:29:10,230 --> 00:29:12,000
This is after all trash...

316
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,430
Excuse me.

317
00:29:27,250 --> 00:29:29,830
Are you Tsutsui Makoto?

318
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:38,180
Please come in. It's a tiny space.

319
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,400
Thank you.

320
00:29:40,580 --> 00:29:41,630
Did Noda tell you about that shop?

321
00:29:42,430 --> 00:29:45,130
Yes. What kind of relationship do you have with Noda?

322
00:29:46,530 --> 00:29:49,180
Noda introduced this room to me.

323
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:10,280
He’s been asking me to write my memoir and appear on his TV show ever since my sentence was decided 10 years ago.

324
00:30:11,150 --> 00:30:12,330
Since 10 years ago?

325
00:30:13,080 --> 00:30:20,430
Yes. He somehow knew that I was innocent.

326
00:30:24,300 --> 00:30:28,930
As it was written in Hiroki's article, I didn't kill my wife.

327
00:30:30,930 --> 00:30:34,080
But you confessed to your crime, right? Why did you do that?

328
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,380
At first, I denied it.

329
00:30:37,830 --> 00:30:43,900
However I realized during the interrogation that the police suspected Hiroki.

330
00:30:46,730 --> 00:30:49,880
It also made sense to me.

331
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,750
Why can't you solve this easy question?

332
00:30:54,450 --> 00:30:55,500
I'm sorry.

333
00:30:55,630 --> 00:31:02,350
Due to my own irresponsibility, my wife's love and expectations ended up going entirely to Hiroki.

334
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:10,230
So, I thought that Hiroki must have pushed himself beyond his limits.

335
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:21,380
Because I was a worthless person and abandoned my responsibilities as his father, Hiroki ended up killing his mother.

336
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:27,980
So, I thought the only thing I could do was take the blame for my son's crime.

337
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:31,730
The murder weapon was found, right?

338
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:37,630
I gave a random location where it wouldn’t seem suspicious, even if the police couldn’t find it.

339
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:40,330
I threw the weapon into the Tamase River.

340
00:31:41,530 --> 00:31:44,530
But then, the murder weapon was really found in the Tamase River.

341
00:31:45,580 --> 00:31:50,580
I think Hiroki threw it into the Tamase River after watching the police's large-scale search.

342
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:56,950
And it seemed that there was a report that my wife and I were arguing that day.

343
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:07,150
I was convinced that Hiroki wanted me to take the blame for his crime.

344
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:15,330
Kanji, are you not involved in The Eye of Horus Murder Incident?

345
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:27,530
No, but as soon as I was released, The Eye of Horus Murder Incident began, so I thought that Hiroki may have wanted to pin a crime on me again.

346
00:32:28,700 --> 00:32:30,950
If that were the case, I was prepared to be arrested at any time.

347
00:32:31,630 --> 00:32:37,280
I bought the same knife that was in Hiroki's article, and I purposely acted suspiciously.

348
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:42,250
You tried to attack me the other day, right? What was that for?

349
00:32:42,500 --> 00:32:44,250
Hey, what are you doing?!

350
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:49,530
I was following him because I didn't want him to commit any more crimes.

351
00:32:50,780 --> 00:32:53,500
I tried to prevent you from getting involved in the incident.

352
00:32:55,350 --> 00:32:57,930
I'm sorry for scaring you.

353
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:01,450
So, that's what happened...

354
00:33:06,450 --> 00:33:12,830
Actually, after that, I talked to him for the first time in 25 years.

355
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:22,900
Hiroki, please stop it. Don't hurt those who have nothing to do with us.

356
00:33:28,700 --> 00:33:31,280
You're following me to persuade me, right?

357
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:36,450
It's all your fault.

358
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:43,980
If you hadn't abandoned my mother, this wouldn't have happened.

359
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:47,700
I'm sorry.

360
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:51,950
It's not something that can be solved with an apology!

361
00:33:53,800 --> 00:34:01,550
What you need to do now is support Mikuru.

362
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:04,880
Mikuru?

363
00:34:08,850 --> 00:34:10,600
I'll be gone soon.

364
00:34:14,580 --> 00:34:16,180
So, after that,...

365
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:23,580
That was the first time I'd known Mikuru was raised by Kumiko.

366
00:34:24,830 --> 00:34:29,750
"I'll be gone soon", did Hiroki say so to you?

367
00:34:37,350 --> 00:34:44,400
I'm the one who turned Hiroki into a murderer.

368
00:34:49,180 --> 00:34:51,750
Hiro isn't a murderer.

369
00:34:52,750 --> 00:34:55,650
There's no way he could have awakened.

370
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:05,830
Because I'm the one who killed a mother.

371
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:17,000
Mikuru?!

372
00:35:22,230 --> 00:35:24,700
Is there a possibility that Shitara Hiroki isn't the suspect?

373
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:26,700
He is suspicious.

374
00:35:26,780 --> 00:35:28,780
Noda doesn't have an alibi.

375
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,180
Aplastic anemia?

376
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,550
It seems that it's designated as an intractable disease by the government.

377
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,350
Mikuru's condition is very severe and life-threatening.

378
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,750
But it seems that she hadn't visited the doctor until now.

379
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:48,800
What? Why not?

380
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:53,480
Because I don't have a family register.

381
00:35:54,130 --> 00:35:55,400
Mikuru!

382
00:35:58,280 --> 00:35:59,850
How are you feeling?

383
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:02,430
I'm fine. I'm used to it.

384
00:36:04,930 --> 00:36:06,750
Don't you have a family register?

385
00:36:10,130 --> 00:36:14,200
My biological mother hasn't submitted my birth registration.

386
00:36:16,850 --> 00:36:24,330
After I came to the Shitara family, my mother-in-law, Kumiko, noticed it.

387
00:36:25,830 --> 00:36:29,230
However, she didn't add my name to a family register.

388
00:36:32,500 --> 00:36:37,450
Even without a family register, she could attend school, but she was forced to live without health insurance.

389
00:36:40,830 --> 00:36:45,580
I discovered this illness after we left the Shitara residence.

390
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:50,300
I was told that the only way to cure this illness was a bone marrow transplant.

391
00:36:50,650 --> 00:36:55,030
But since I didn't have health insurance, I was told that the cost would be 10 million yen.

392
00:36:56,980 --> 00:37:00,880
If I managed it with blood transfusions, I had to go to the hospital every week.

393
00:37:01,780 --> 00:37:05,330
The cost for that would be over 120,000 yen every month.

394
00:37:08,550 --> 00:37:14,600
That's why Hiro quit university without telling his mother, and he worked multiple part-time jobs.

395
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:23,450
He somehow got blood products and gave me blood transfusions every week.

396
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,500
Did Hiroki give you blood transfusions?

397
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:34,830
Are you sure they were all blood products?

398
00:37:36,230 --> 00:37:38,250
Was there any blood that wasn't processed?

399
00:37:40,030 --> 00:37:42,930
I can't say for sure, but probably not.

400
00:37:44,630 --> 00:37:51,880
Blood products that you saw in the fridge...He got things like that from somewhere.

401
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:57,880
But I think he didn't have enough money.

402
00:37:59,530 --> 00:38:02,780
Eventually, he started working at the night bar.

403
00:38:04,200 --> 00:38:10,350
Hiro seemed to get more and more exhausted, and he reached his limit.

404
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:17,180
So, we decided to ask our mother for money.

405
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:24,450
That day, I arrived at her house first.

406
00:38:26,450 --> 00:38:29,930
Hiroki is working at the night bar? What the hell is going on?

407
00:38:31,350 --> 00:38:32,800
We need money for blood transfusions...

408
00:38:32,900 --> 00:38:35,630
How much more do you need to ruin Hiroki's life to be satisfied?!

409
00:38:37,200 --> 00:38:38,250
I'm sorry.

410
00:38:38,780 --> 00:38:42,380
I wish you'd just die.

411
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,480
You're really a jinx!

412
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,400
Stop it.

413
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:53,080
Give me back my Hiroki!

414
00:39:12,130 --> 00:39:12,930
Mom...

415
00:39:16,630 --> 00:39:18,300
I didn't know what to do.

416
00:39:19,550 --> 00:39:21,700
So, I called Hiro.

417
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:30,800
Hiro didn't kill his mother. I killed her.

418
00:39:37,330 --> 00:39:38,700
Did you stab her once?

419
00:39:41,530 --> 00:39:44,000
At that time, did you stab her once?

420
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:49,700
I don't remember.

421
00:39:53,650 --> 00:39:59,000
Before Hiroki ran away, I received Mikuru's family register from him.

422
00:40:01,200 --> 00:40:05,700
He did that so Mikuru could receive treatment.

423
00:40:09,430 --> 00:40:11,030
Why did he do that now?

424
00:40:14,700 --> 00:40:20,630
Why didn't he apply for Mikuru's family register right after Kumiko died?

425
00:40:23,650 --> 00:40:29,400
"I can't do that right now, but please leave it to me", Hiro said.

426
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,200
Isn't he the suspect?

427
00:40:37,850 --> 00:40:39,580
I should've trusted him.

428
00:40:42,430 --> 00:40:45,050
He was a kind man who cared deeply for his sister...

429
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,350
I jumped to conclusions without knowing the truth.

430
00:40:52,450 --> 00:40:54,000
I'm stupid.

431
00:40:56,600 --> 00:40:58,630
You should talk to the police.

432
00:41:01,930 --> 00:41:08,400
I'm sure Hiro isn't the suspect.

433
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:27,650
Hiroki doesn't mention Mikuru at all in his articles.

434
00:41:29,530 --> 00:41:33,100
He must want to protect her no matter what.

435
00:41:38,480 --> 00:41:42,730
Kumiko had 13 stab wounds all over her body.

436
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:47,930
Does that mean that Mikuru stabbed Kumiko repeatedly in that situation?

437
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:51,850
Or did Hiroki do that?

438
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,430
I think it makes more sense that if Hiroki did that.

439
00:41:58,500 --> 00:42:05,730
He killed his mother, and he drained the victims' blood for Mikuru?

440
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,400
Today's article seemed to be Hiroki's style.

441
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,800
If that's the case, the motive and various other details would make sense...

442
00:42:26,150 --> 00:42:30,000
I'm very confused right now. I just want to give up thinking about it.

443
00:42:32,330 --> 00:42:34,000
Makoto...

444
00:42:36,780 --> 00:42:38,900
I wonder if the truth was somewhere.

445
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:44,150
However, I can't find even 1% of the truth myself.

446
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:55,350
Ah, it smells good.
Doesn't it?

447
00:43:23,140 --> 00:43:25,780
Breaking News
Exclusive 6th article from suspect Shitara Hiroki
I'll carry out my last murder on July 7th

448
00:43:23,380 --> 00:43:26,980
In the newest article by the suspect Shitara, posted last night,

449
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:32,650
he claimed responsibility and said he'd carry out his last murder on July 7th.

450
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:38,630
I'll put an end to this series of murders at the place where it all began.

451
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:41,080
Please witness it through the live stream.

452
00:43:41,530 --> 00:43:46,100
If the police can identify this "The place where it all began", there's a chance to prevent the 7th murder beforehand, right?

453
00:43:46,400 --> 00:43:52,930
Yes, and the police are rushing to identify the location, but so far, they haven't been able to do that.

454
00:43:53,900 --> 00:43:56,350
On SNS, people say that the suspect Shitara's hometown...

455
00:43:56,440 --> 00:44:00,230
The place where it all began

456
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:05,330
The key to that room?

457
00:44:53,600 --> 00:44:56,330
I've had a habit of keeping everything since I was a kid.

458
00:44:56,530 --> 00:44:59,850
I kept my precious things in a box.

459
00:45:43,350 --> 00:45:44,930
He really kept it...

460
00:45:47,880 --> 00:45:51,050
I want you to stay true to yourself.

461
00:45:51,530 --> 00:45:55,130
Makoto,

462
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:59,900
Makoto, I love you.

463
00:46:57,850 --> 00:47:02,780
Tsutsui Makoto

464
00:47:05,650 --> 00:47:10,400
Since Owada died, I've been wondering what I should do with this.

465
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:13,480
I'm glad you didn't give this to anybody.

466
00:47:13,980 --> 00:47:14,830
Please take it.

467
00:47:31,250 --> 00:47:33,130
When are you going to wake up?

468
00:47:36,900 --> 00:47:38,500
Nothing unusual around the station.

469
00:47:37,590 --> 00:47:41,480
July 7th, 6 pm

470
00:47:38,730 --> 00:47:40,030
Same as here.

471
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,480
Same as here.

472
00:47:42,900 --> 00:47:44,530
Shitara

473
00:47:46,950 --> 00:47:47,950
Hello?

474
00:47:48,430 --> 00:47:53,250
Makoto, you should stay home today.

475
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:56,800
I've found out the truth.

476
00:47:59,650 --> 00:48:01,330
I'll stop Hiroki.

477
00:48:02,080 --> 00:48:04,550
What? What do you mean?

478
00:48:06,550 --> 00:48:07,530
I'm sorry.

479
00:48:08,330 --> 00:48:11,680
Hey, Makoto. Makoto?

480
00:48:23,030 --> 00:48:24,350
Where's Aoi?

481
00:48:25,300 --> 00:48:26,230
She should be here.

482
00:48:33,280 --> 00:48:35,550
Hey, where's Noda?

483
00:48:35,700 --> 00:48:38,580
What? Where has he gone?

484
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:56,000
Yotsuba Supermarket

485
00:49:30,180 --> 00:49:34,580
You're a moron to come all the way here to get killed.

486
00:49:44,890 --> 00:49:48,280
Final episode

487
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:53,450
I'm going to show you a show I created that will be worth this series of murders.
