1
00:00:03,550 --> 00:00:06,930
The serial killing shaking the public, known as The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:10,280
On May 5th, when the 5th crime occurred,

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:13,780
I encountered a person who seemed to be the suspect and barely escaped death.

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:16,000
And the newly discovered fact is...

5
00:00:16,100 --> 00:00:20,700
The forensic autopsy found a needle mark on the arm of Kanbe Kyoko, the 5th victim.

6
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:23,030
I think the suspect may have taken blood from them.

7
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:25,050
The person who matches the description of the suspect is...

8
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,730
I practiced collecting blood on him at home, he said he wanted to try collecting blood himself.

9
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,500
He kept practicing on me again and again until he became good at it.

10
00:00:31,630 --> 00:00:34,400
When I became his regular customer, he asked me for blood.

11
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:39,850
I can't understand you. I can't see the truth.

12
00:00:40,330 --> 00:00:51,030
I did nothing but love you so much that I may have kept missing what was very important.

13
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,800
What are you doing?

14
00:01:03,580 --> 00:01:06,630
What are you doing in our place?

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,400
Who are you?

16
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:21,180
Hiro has changed a lot since he met you.

17
00:01:22,730 --> 00:01:25,080
Mikuru, stop it.

18
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:29,600
Don't take my Hiro from me.
Mikuru!

19
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:39,580
So, you have a girlfriend, right?

20
00:01:49,330 --> 00:01:52,080
That's enough.

21
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:54,350
I'm sorry for entering your place without permission.

22
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,230
Makoto,

23
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,750
I'll never see you again.

24
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,650
Really?
Yes.

25
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:37,780
Does she live with him?

26
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:38,850
I guess so.

27
00:02:39,580 --> 00:02:41,450
My Hiro...

28
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:43,650
It's the worst-case scenario, isn't it?

29
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:51,250
When you find out that the man you love is into a type of girl you don't get along with, your feeling for him fades instantly, right?

30
00:02:51,430 --> 00:02:53,600
Ah, you like that kind of girl...Something like that.

31
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:58,480
Why didn't I realize it?

32
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:00,850
There were many suspicious things about him.

33
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,200
Or...I think I've been aware of it for a long time.

34
00:03:05,380 --> 00:03:07,130
I was pretending not to realize.

35
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,380
After all, it was just a bunch of lies.

36
00:03:12,350 --> 00:03:16,480
I loved him, and I thought he loved me too.

37
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,680
But once I knew it wasn't true, all my doubts about him turned pitch black.

38
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:24,680
Are you talking about the blood story?

39
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:32,930
That story was definitely creepy, but I think his feelings for you are real.

40
00:03:34,830 --> 00:03:38,530
Damn it, why did I end up getting involved with someone like him?

41
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:43,780
Wait a second. We never really had a relationship in the first place, right?

42
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:47,280
Right? Because I was his affair woman.

43
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:52,550
Instead of being cheated on by a boyfriend, making myself an affair woman without knowing makes me angrier.

44
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,780
That's way worse, right? That pisses me off!

45
00:03:57,110 --> 00:03:59,430
Shitara Hiroki

46
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,600
I think he loves you...

47
00:04:06,680 --> 00:04:09,350
But he never said he loved me.
Really?

48
00:04:10,380 --> 00:04:13,200
That's not acceptable! You should dump him immediately.

49
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:16,600
I've told you that we never had a relationship in the first place.
Ah, yes.

50
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:24,400
I want to love somebody to be happy.

51
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:30,530
Okay, I'll delete his contact right now.

52
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:35,950
That's a typical mistake. Deleting his contact only means he'll use the numbers that aren't saved to your phone.

53
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,800
You're not trying to make that happen purposely, right?

54
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,230
You won't answer the unknown number, realize it's from him, and continue the relationship with him, right?

55
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,750
No, I won't! I'll block him now!

56
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,680
It's done.

57
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:58,230
Let's eat more!

58
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:03,150
Everybody is covered in lust.

59
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:15,350
Maybe I still hadn't given up on the ordinary happiness I thought I'd given up long ago.

60
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:26,350
But if I loved you more deeply, I'd end up wanting to put chains on you and keep you by my side.

61
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:37,480
Do you really love her?

62
00:05:40,030 --> 00:05:41,130
Don't see her anymore.

63
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:49,580
I know.

64
00:05:51,880 --> 00:05:52,980
Are you upset with me?

65
00:05:58,250 --> 00:05:59,530
No, I'm not.

66
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:05,830
I'm afraid of myself when I think that way.

67
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:15,700
That's why I kept wishing that you'd leave me first.

68
00:06:20,730 --> 00:06:26,980
Koi wa Yami (Love is Darkness)

69
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,000
Makoto!

70
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:36,050
Itsuki, hello!

71
00:06:36,130 --> 00:06:38,750
Delivery?
Yes, I just delivered it.

72
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,430
Episode 6

73
00:06:38,930 --> 00:06:43,130
I may have finally got some big info.
What about it?

74
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:45,000
You want to know, don't you?!

75
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:47,550
You just want to tell that to somebody, right?
That's right.

76
00:06:47,950 --> 00:06:50,500
It's about an eccentric forensic man.

77
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:52,800
Get out!

78
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,750
Ah, Matsuoka?

79
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:01,030
He is the deputy commissioner's nephew.

80
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,300
It seems that he is a crime geek and has a strong interest in blood.

81
00:07:08,350 --> 00:07:11,980
That fits the profile of the suspect.

82
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,730
The theory is that the suspect took the victim's blood with him.

83
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:18,200
Kinoshita, be quiet.

84
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,080
Don't worry, I'm tight-lipped.

85
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:24,100
That's totally not true!

86
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,030
What are you so excited about?

87
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:29,050
On no, Noda...

88
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,200
What's wrong?

89
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:39,980
It seems that Matsuoka, a forensic officer, has a strong interest in blood and knows a lot of info about blood-related incidents.

90
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,800
He's taken evidence without permission before.

91
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:47,180
It seems that he should have been fired a long time ago, but his uncle, the deputy commissioner, covers it up every time.

92
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,650
Come to think of it, he arrived at the crime scene very early that day.

93
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,500
Even the police officers seemed to have some doubts.

94
00:07:56,780 --> 00:08:01,350
If the suspect is a forensic officer, it makes sense that there're no traces of the suspect at the crime scene.

95
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:02,480
Good point.

96
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:05,530
It may be worth inspecting whether he may be the suspect.

97
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:06,800
Good point.

98
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:14,880
The serial murders are continuing because Matsuoka is a psychopath, and the police let him do whatever he wants.

99
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,050
Good point!

100
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:19,200
Itsuki, can we film your interview?

101
00:08:19,250 --> 00:08:20,500
What? Am I going to be on TV?!

102
00:08:20,550 --> 00:08:21,600
Let's do that!

103
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,100
Kinoshita, please prepare for the interview.
Yes.

104
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:26,250
What the hell are you talking about?

105
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:29,380
You're all morons.

106
00:08:30,150 --> 00:08:33,180
We don't have to use his interview immediately, but it could be useful later...

107
00:08:36,430 --> 00:08:42,200
The fact that the police are covering up misconduct by their staff is already a serious issue.

108
00:08:42,380 --> 00:08:43,550
It's worth broadcasting.

109
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:51,100
If you accuse the police without proper evidence, it'll damage the relationship between our news department and the MPD.

110
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:51,900
But,

111
00:08:52,050 --> 00:08:59,100
Ah, Matsuoka's height is under 175 cm. He is shorter than I am.

112
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:02,330
Then, that doesn't fit the suspect's profile.

113
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:10,500
What's wrong? It's not like you.

114
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,680
I thought you understood the risk of being interviewed.

115
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:23,600
We can't take back the words that have been released to the public.

116
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:29,430
Those words could escape from us and grow bigger and bigger.

117
00:09:31,950 --> 00:09:35,430
I'm sorry, I was simplistic.

118
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:39,830
Anything wrong?

119
00:09:45,950 --> 00:09:55,230
I understand logically, but if I let my guard down, I unconsciously look for reasons that are convenient to me.

120
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,980
The reasons I believe what I've seen was true.

121
00:10:04,150 --> 00:10:06,550
I wish he isn't the suspect...

122
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:15,400
I'll work properly with an unbiased vision.

123
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:18,000
I'm sorry.

124
00:10:22,230 --> 00:10:25,780
Okay. However, that story, Matsuoka...

125
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,100
I think it's strange too.

126
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:37,500
Hey, did you know?

127
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:41,230
Don't scare me. What about it?

128
00:10:41,450 --> 00:10:44,500
The blood relationship is stronger than we think, right?

129
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:54,930
An individual should be respected as an individual life form from the moment they are born into the world.

130
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:59,430
But in reality, they're treated like copies.

131
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:04,750
Sharing blood is a cruel thing, right?

132
00:11:05,350 --> 00:11:06,980
What are you talking about?

133
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:13,650
Shitara Kumiko was a patient with Hepatitis C.

134
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:22,300
Are you saying that Shitara Hiroki also has Hepatitis C due to mother-to-child transmission?

135
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:24,800
I checked that.

136
00:11:25,030 --> 00:11:28,650
Shitara Kumiko got into a car accident when she was a student.

137
00:11:28,830 --> 00:11:33,250
And she was infected with Hepatitis C from a blood transfusion she received at that time.

138
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:38,280
I've heard that the risk of mother-to-child transmission isn't that high.

139
00:11:39,280 --> 00:11:41,130
But it's not like there's zero risk either.

140
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:52,650
I guess the suspect drains blood from the victims and takes it as a trophy because the suspect is obsessed with healthy blood...

141
00:11:53,930 --> 00:11:55,680
I wonder if that's Hiroki's motive.

142
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:02,500
Thank you for your hard work.

143
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:07,830
Komine Masakiyo
Hello!

144
00:12:12,500 --> 00:12:15,800
It's a weird question, but can Hepatitis C virus be transmitted through everyday life?

145
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:18,380
Hepatitis C?

146
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:26,180
Because it's transmitted through blood, I think the risk in everyday life is low.

147
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:47,850
Is it okay to broadcast the interview footage of Hanamura Yuriko's parents?

148
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:54,080
Let's emphasize the anger and grief of the bereaved family members of all victims.
Yes.

149
00:12:54,780 --> 00:12:56,700
I want to ask you something too.

150
00:12:57,850 --> 00:13:03,100
It seems that an eyewitness testimony was sent to the husband of Ikeuchi Nanami, the 1st victim.

151
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,380
Check this.

152
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:11,300
I saw your wife arguing fiercely with a man on the day of the incident.

153
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:15,630
After watching the news, I was certain the woman was your wife.

154
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:23,950
After the incident, her husband created an account to ask for help in solving the incident and collecting eyewitness reports.

155
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,430
He decided to meet the informant to get more info.

156
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,630
He gave me permission to film the scene.

157
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:31,950
Amazing!

158
00:13:32,150 --> 00:13:34,030
That could be a scoop.

159
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,500
Really?

160
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,550
Because you kept in touch with him, he shared the info with you.

161
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:44,280
Yes. I've been keeping in touch with him and discussing how to make the posts spread more widely, something like that.

162
00:13:44,450 --> 00:13:48,950
I didn't know you were really motivated.
I am!

163
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,980
You guys are doing your best in your own way!

164
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:55,930
Okay, Kinoshita, you're in charge of this.
Yes.

165
00:13:56,250 --> 00:13:58,600
Create an attractive story.
Yes.

166
00:14:18,750 --> 00:14:20,150
Will it be a scoop?

167
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:21,880
Don't get too excited.

168
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,300
Please let me do since it's my first scoop.

169
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:27,480
Thank you for your hard work.

170
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:29,650
Why are you here?

171
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,430
I contacted him.

172
00:14:31,500 --> 00:14:32,550
What? Why?

173
00:14:33,130 --> 00:14:35,130
Because you two always work together, right?

174
00:14:35,250 --> 00:14:36,080
Do we?

175
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:39,830
Don't be so cold. We're always together, right?

176
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,800
Also, if I work with Shitara, I may be able to get more info for a scoop.

177
00:14:43,150 --> 00:14:46,400
You're so nice.
Thank you.

178
00:14:46,500 --> 00:14:49,700
It's your scoop, so there's no reason to give it away to others.

179
00:14:49,830 --> 00:14:53,080
Oh my god, she called me "Others".
You're others.

180
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:57,100
Are you guys fighting by any chance?

181
00:14:57,530 --> 00:14:58,700
It's not fighting, but...

182
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,550
It's annoying, please make up ASAP.

183
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,780
Do we?

184
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,630
All info is welcome.

185
00:15:16,630 --> 00:15:19,280
My wife will never come back, no matter what I do.

186
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:23,230
Interviewer
The husband of Ikeuchi Nanami

187
00:15:20,650 --> 00:15:22,850
So, I sometimes want to give up on everything.

188
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:27,630
But my wife was a great fighter.

189
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:46,480
So, I have to close this incident properly and tell her, "It's all solved, you can finally rest peacefully".

190
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:58,550
The appointed time has long passed. The eyewitness is late.

191
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:01,700
I'm going to take a look.

192
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:06,680
Kinoshita is very thoughtful.

193
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:12,000
He always does his best, and moreover, he adores me.

194
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:16,630
What's your intention?

195
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:22,750
How can you remain so normal?

196
00:16:26,080 --> 00:16:27,230
It's impossible for me.

197
00:16:29,550 --> 00:16:31,730
I don't know what to trust.

198
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:35,880
And I don't know what kind of person you are.

199
00:16:41,350 --> 00:16:47,880
The only thing I understood was that you were lying to me.

200
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:54,700
I'd noticed that you were hiding something the whole time.

201
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:58,480
But I pretended not to see it.

202
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:03,850
I felt that if I asked you about it, everything would be over.

203
00:17:09,580 --> 00:17:13,550
But I can't keep acting like I don't notice anything.

204
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:18,980
She isn't my girlfriend.

205
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,600
She isn't my girlfriend.

206
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:24,880
Then, who is she?

207
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:32,450
You're silent again.

208
00:17:37,480 --> 00:17:38,450
I'm sorry.

209
00:17:48,530 --> 00:17:52,080
I'll investigate the crime scenes, so can you take care of the stores?

210
00:17:52,250 --> 00:17:54,930
Excuse me, have you seen Owada?

211
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:56,800
No.

212
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:00,750
Where has she gone?

213
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,450
Ah, here!

214
00:18:03,880 --> 00:18:07,930
I see. This is clearer.

215
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:09,080
That's right.

216
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,650
There's a high possibility that he is holding a knife in this footage.

217
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,830
I see.

218
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:26,100
Welcome.

219
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:29,600
May I have a coffee? Ah, please put it on a separate bill.

220
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:30,980
Certainly.

221
00:18:33,430 --> 00:18:36,700
I don't want to introduce truly tasty restaurants on TV.

222
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:41,930
You do anything to get high viewer ratings, right?

223
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:47,130
Most people in this world don't understand the true value of things.

224
00:18:48,330 --> 00:18:55,250
I'd rather not make those restaurants famous if they're ruined by those kinds of people.

225
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:58,280
Your theory is darker than I expected.

226
00:18:58,700 --> 00:19:00,480
What? Which part?

227
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:05,480
Thank you for introducing me to a trustworthy video analysis company.

228
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,800
That was a big help.

229
00:19:08,250 --> 00:19:11,300
What's going on, you can't analyze it in the police department?

230
00:19:12,750 --> 00:19:14,580
Does that mean the suspect in this incident is inside the police station?

231
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:22,350
How much of the truth have you discovered?

232
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:29,530
Well, I've never seen him.

233
00:19:29,950 --> 00:19:34,480
If I see a stranger around here, I think I'll notice right away.

234
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:37,150
I see, thank you for your cooperation.

235
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:38,830
Let's go.

236
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:45,730
They're gone.

237
00:19:51,850 --> 00:19:53,030
Thank you.

238
00:19:56,900 --> 00:20:01,250
Ikeuchi, I don't think anybody will come here.

239
00:20:01,350 --> 00:20:07,600
This world is rotten. What was he thinking when he sent me this message?

240
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,800
I trusted this message and came here.

241
00:20:15,850 --> 00:20:18,800
I'm the idiot who waited for him for hours.

242
00:20:19,650 --> 00:20:22,150
He is probably watching me somewhere and laughing!

243
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,200
Show yourself!

244
00:20:27,050 --> 00:20:29,800
Come here and laugh at me!

245
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:40,530
Damn it! What would you feel if your family were killed?

246
00:20:42,230 --> 00:20:44,780
Can you still do something like this?!

247
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:49,630
The suspect who killed Nanami and this guy are equally guilty!

248
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:53,850
Does the misfortune of others taste honey?!

249
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,150
I'll never forgive you.

250
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,600
Please stop the video.

251
00:21:06,850 --> 00:21:10,300
I want to broadcast this video as is.

252
00:21:12,250 --> 00:21:13,880
This is absolutely horrible.

253
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:17,650
About 80% of this kind of info is a prank.

254
00:21:22,680 --> 00:21:25,380
Did all of you think that right from the beginning?

255
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:31,430
But it may be genuine, so we have to go and see for ourselves.

256
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:41,050
It's different from crimes like murder, but I think this is also a crime.

257
00:21:41,850 --> 00:21:45,800
I want to let people know that there're people who do such terrible things in this world.

258
00:21:46,650 --> 00:21:48,150
Is there no problem with broadcasting this video as is?

259
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,730
Yes, and I have permission to show his face as well.

260
00:21:53,250 --> 00:21:55,350
Is it safer to blur his face?

261
00:21:56,000 --> 00:22:00,900
Ikeuchi is too emotional to think straight right now, but he may regret it later.

262
00:22:00,930 --> 00:22:04,900
We'll show his face. Do you think the viewers will feel his anger if we blur his face?

263
00:22:09,380 --> 00:22:12,250
Since you have permission, let's show his face.

264
00:22:13,250 --> 00:22:14,350
Thank you.

265
00:22:17,530 --> 00:22:18,850
Show yourself!

266
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,000
Come here and laugh at me!

267
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:31,800
Damn it! What would you feel if your family were killed?

268
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:35,430
The suspect who killed Nanami and this guy are equally guilty!

269
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:39,530
Does the misfortune of others taste honey?!

270
00:22:51,130 --> 00:22:53,480
See you tomorrow.
Ah, are you going home?

271
00:22:55,130 --> 00:22:56,250
Me too.

272
00:22:58,930 --> 00:22:59,880
Let's go.

273
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,150
Kinoshita, is your place this way?

274
00:23:07,730 --> 00:23:10,680
Ah, I can go home this way, too.

275
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:13,250
It's definitely a detour, right?

276
00:23:13,780 --> 00:23:15,750
I have something to do in this way.

277
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:23,100
Did Hiroki ask you something, by any chance?

278
00:23:23,530 --> 00:23:26,280
How did you know?
Because you seem unnatural.

279
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:33,200
He asked me not to leave you alone.

280
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:37,800
He said he couldn't walk you home, so he asked me to do it for him.

281
00:23:39,300 --> 00:23:41,680
This was supposed to be a secret between him and me.

282
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:43,130
But you told me.

283
00:23:43,530 --> 00:23:45,150
Yes, because you figured it out,

284
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:50,350
Shitara is worried about you a lot.

285
00:23:52,080 --> 00:24:01,180
But it makes sense if his loved one was attacked by the suspect, it's natural for him to worry about you.

286
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:07,630
They look delicious.

287
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:11,330
Salmon, cream cheese, and Mayo...

288
00:24:11,550 --> 00:24:12,550
That's a popular one.

289
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:16,500
I see. I think my son would like it.

290
00:24:19,600 --> 00:24:21,280
Hey, Kayo!

291
00:24:21,450 --> 00:24:24,850
Ah, Itsuki! Are you taking a break?

292
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,550
Yes, I'm on standby and taking a break.

293
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:29,230
Those rice balls!

294
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,100
I bought them.

295
00:24:31,550 --> 00:24:35,800
I make rice balls for my son every day. I want to get hints for new ingredients.

296
00:24:37,080 --> 00:24:40,080
Kayo, is your son in his 3rd year of high school?

297
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:46,080
Yes. Hey, listen, my son said he didn't want to go on to college.

298
00:24:46,900 --> 00:24:49,980
He is smart, but it seems he is considerate of me.

299
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,400
We're a single-mother family.

300
00:24:52,950 --> 00:24:56,500
He says he wants to get a job after graduating from high school, so that I can avoid any financial trouble.

301
00:24:57,100 --> 00:24:59,130
I can understand how he feels.

302
00:24:59,650 --> 00:25:01,250
We're also a single-mother family.

303
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:03,700
Really?

304
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:10,300
Yes. I started this job because I wanted to earn money ASAP to help my mother financially.

305
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:12,630
Oh no, it's a beautiful story.

306
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:17,480
However, a mother's happiness comes from a son's happiness.

307
00:25:18,750 --> 00:25:21,700
A son's happiness comes from a mother's happiness.

308
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:23,530
You're a nice man!

309
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:27,080
Itsuki, your mother is a lucky one.

310
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:28,230
I hope so.

311
00:25:33,450 --> 00:25:34,480
Masakiyo?

312
00:25:35,450 --> 00:25:37,600
Ah, you were not home, so...

313
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,530
I'll excuse myself now.

314
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:41,450
Thank you.

315
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:43,230
See you tomorrow.

316
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,630
What's going on?

317
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:49,430
I have something to talk to you about.

318
00:25:49,600 --> 00:25:51,800
Is it about the incident? Any progress?

319
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:54,100
Well...

320
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:56,900
What?

321
00:25:57,880 --> 00:26:02,150
It's about Shitara Hiroki.

322
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:08,780
Have you heard that he has a medical history?

323
00:26:09,480 --> 00:26:11,300
A medical history?
Yes.

324
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:13,880
I haven't.

325
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,830
I don't know anything about Hiroki.

326
00:26:20,930 --> 00:26:22,280
And I have nothing to do with him anymore.

327
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:25,550
What happened?

328
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,450
He lived with a girl.

329
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:35,600
He may have thought about me as an affair woman.

330
00:26:35,930 --> 00:26:40,380
Maybe his female friend happened to visit him.

331
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:44,580
Ah, she may be his sister...

332
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,350
Does Hiroki have brothers or sisters?

333
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:51,680
No. I'm sure because I checked his family registry.

334
00:26:52,430 --> 00:26:55,830
However, according to a certificate of residence, he lives alone.

335
00:26:56,650 --> 00:26:57,850
Are you trying to comfort me?

336
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:00,280
Well...

337
00:27:03,880 --> 00:27:09,080
Thank you. But I'm fine.

338
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:15,830
I'll never see him again, and I don't know anything about him.

339
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:18,700
See you.

340
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:45,600
Let's go for a drink!

341
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,700
What? Aoi...

342
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:49,580
Let's go for a drink!

343
00:27:49,730 --> 00:27:51,580
What's going on, Aoi?

344
00:27:53,950 --> 00:27:55,980
Are you all right?

345
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:57,080
What about it?

346
00:27:57,350 --> 00:28:02,680
You're very close with the person next to you, and going out with a man alone even it's me...

347
00:28:02,950 --> 00:28:06,050
Stop treating me like I'm a fragile woman.

348
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:11,450
Do victims have to live as victims forever? I'm really pissed off.

349
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:13,480
I'm sorry.

350
00:28:13,550 --> 00:28:17,300
Did you ask if I was okay going out with a man alone? I'm just fine because it's you.

351
00:28:19,330 --> 00:28:20,350
So, what's your plan?

352
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:25,050
You heard that Makoto broke up with Hiroki, right?

353
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:31,880
Don't be lazy! You finally get a chance.

354
00:28:32,530 --> 00:28:33,580
I'm not lazy...

355
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,850
Stop hesitating and tell her how you feel about her.

356
00:28:35,980 --> 00:28:37,780
Now is the only chance.

357
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:43,980
But telling her my feelings now seems like I'm taking advantage of her weakness. I don't know if that's the right thing to do as a man.

358
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:47,750
But there's no other way for you to win over Hiroki.

359
00:28:49,230 --> 00:28:50,780
You're really harsh today.

360
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:58,930
It's rare to have someone who tells you the truth after you've grown up, right?

361
00:29:01,080 --> 00:29:03,100
Another beer, please.

362
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:06,300
By the way, didn't you say you wouldn't support my love?

363
00:29:08,750 --> 00:29:11,230
I thought it was time for me to move on.

364
00:29:13,530 --> 00:29:15,750
If your love goes well, that's totally fine for me.

365
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,400
Anyway, hurry up and tell her how you feel about her.

366
00:29:20,130 --> 00:29:21,900
That topic again?

367
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:24,650
Here you are.
Thank you.

368
00:29:25,530 --> 00:29:28,680
Makoto is insensitive, so if you don't say it directly or she won't notice.

369
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,950
But don't tell her like telling her a joke.

370
00:29:33,450 --> 00:29:37,580
You should choose words to let her know you're serious.

371
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,550
Don't tell her hastily or based on impulse.

372
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:48,080
Then, Professor, in that case, where would be a good place to do?

373
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:52,100
Well...Where?

374
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:06,900
Ah...Something is different.

375
00:30:07,030 --> 00:30:08,700
That's fine. It's tasty.

376
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,000
I may add soy sauce...

377
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:58,930
I'm sorry.

378
00:31:01,630 --> 00:31:16,950
I'm sorry.

379
00:31:31,680 --> 00:31:33,100
Tsutsui Makoto,

380
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:41,980
Please promise me not to get involved with Hiro anymore.

381
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:47,680
What are you?

382
00:31:49,300 --> 00:31:51,050
He told me you're not his girlfriend.

383
00:31:51,150 --> 00:31:52,350
I'm his accomplice.

384
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:57,900
Are you prepared to come to our side?

385
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,900
What do you mean?

386
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,350
You don't know the real Hiro.

387
00:32:05,480 --> 00:32:11,880
And Hiro never tells you that.

388
00:32:34,230 --> 00:32:35,280
Makoto...,

389
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:37,900
What's going on?

390
00:32:39,400 --> 00:32:44,230
People who viewed that video are getting really into the discussion about who the suspect is in The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

391
00:32:44,730 --> 00:32:47,300
The footage has been edited as they like and is spreading widely.

392
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:46,450
It's strange that her husband is so eager to appear on TV
He is definitely the suspect

393
00:32:46,470 --> 00:32:48,290
He can't control his anger
The suspects of theatrical crimes tend to seek attention

394
00:32:48,310 --> 00:32:50,120
I feel uneasy about the difference in how he behaves compared to the other bereaved families

395
00:32:48,350 --> 00:32:52,580
What would you feel if your family were killed?

396
00:32:53,130 --> 00:32:54,850
Why did it turn out this way?

397
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:57,930
Yes, excuse me.

398
00:32:59,950 --> 00:33:01,080
How was Ikeuchi?

399
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:06,800
He is fine. He was quite angry, but I helped him understand that it wasn't our fault.

400
00:33:07,130 --> 00:33:09,650
It doesn't matter if it's our fault or not.

401
00:33:11,330 --> 00:33:13,280
Why didn't we expect this to happen?

402
00:33:15,100 --> 00:33:16,130
I'm sorry.

403
00:33:16,930 --> 00:33:21,430
Do we have to eliminate all the risk factors that far ahead?

404
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:27,180
When the bereaved families are mistreated by some crazy people, and if they get angry,

405
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:31,280
the public starts saying, "There's something wrong with getting angry over something like that small thing".

406
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:38,100
If we keep exercising self-regulation based on such minority opinions, soon there won't be anything we can broadcast.

407
00:33:39,180 --> 00:33:41,130
That's bullshit!

408
00:33:41,730 --> 00:33:47,300
Are you saying it's unavoidable for Ikeuchi to be hurt? You're out of your mind!

409
00:33:48,430 --> 00:33:55,300
We hurt the person we should protect the most...What's the purpose of broadcasting this show?

410
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:04,130
I see.

411
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,580
Shitara, did you know this would happen?

412
00:34:12,880 --> 00:34:14,680
That's why you didn't write the article?

413
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,900
It's easy to control public opinion.

414
00:34:25,450 --> 00:34:32,730
When somebody makes a story, it begins spreading as the truth.

415
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:24,850
Hey, what the hell are you doing?!

416
00:35:29,130 --> 00:35:30,050
Are you all right?

417
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:31,930
Hiroki...

418
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:36,150
Was that person the suspect of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident?

419
00:35:38,650 --> 00:35:41,250
I'm sorry. It's nothing to do with that incident.

420
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:49,400
That person is s probably...my father.

421
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:54,700
I'm sorry.

422
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:58,650
Why did he attack me?

423
00:36:04,350 --> 00:36:09,180
So, you're still connected to your father, who is under police surveillance, right?

424
00:36:12,830 --> 00:36:14,900
Was that staged, by any chance?

425
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:17,600
What do you want to do?
Makoto...

426
00:36:17,650 --> 00:36:19,680
Why are you wearing the same sneakers as the suspect?

427
00:36:21,150 --> 00:36:23,250
Why did you practice drawing blood?

428
00:36:24,330 --> 00:36:26,250
Why did you ask your guest for blood?

429
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:31,730
I'm scared because I keep discovering more about you that I don't know, but I can't talk to anybody about it.

430
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:35,100
I can't take this anymore!

431
00:36:38,930 --> 00:36:39,880
I'm sorry.

432
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:47,400
That's enough.

433
00:36:51,350 --> 00:36:53,580
You don't have to pretend to worry about me anymore.

434
00:37:18,580 --> 00:37:24,100
Don't do things on your own...Dad.

435
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:03,800
Welcome.

436
00:38:05,650 --> 00:38:08,630
What happened to you? It's unusual for us to meet at a place like this.

437
00:38:08,750 --> 00:38:12,080
I thought it'd be nice to come to a place like this once in a while.

438
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,280
I see.

439
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,750
Makoto has arrived

440
00:38:23,970 --> 00:38:26,600
Okay, I'll be there!

441
00:38:31,930 --> 00:38:33,100
What's wrong?

442
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:37,930
Can I go out during the break?

443
00:38:38,080 --> 00:38:38,900
Of course.

444
00:38:39,930 --> 00:38:43,350
Ah, do you have a date by any chance?

445
00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:45,580
Are you going to tell her how you feel?

446
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,930
I'm going to the battlefield.

447
00:38:51,180 --> 00:38:52,830
Go for broke.

448
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,380
Make sure you come back alive.

449
00:38:56,730 --> 00:38:59,230
Yes. I'm going.

450
00:39:07,580 --> 00:39:09,330
Is there something going on?

451
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:25,030
Breaking News
The Eye of Horus Murder Incident had a prologue
A strange coincidence with the incident from 10 years ago...
Shitara Hiroki

452
00:39:27,750 --> 00:39:28,850
What's wrong?

453
00:39:36,500 --> 00:39:45,950
That day, when I returned to my parents' home after a long time, it had changed so much that I could hardly recognize it from the place in my memory.

454
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:59,280
My mother had been stabbed 13 times all over her body and was sitting leaning against the wall.

455
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:07,980
After being questioned by the police several times, I realized that I was treated as a suspect.

456
00:40:09,230 --> 00:40:16,650
It seems the reason was that her blood on my T-shirt was dry when I met the police.

457
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:21,300
I couldn't remember anything about that time.

458
00:40:22,750 --> 00:40:31,300
From discovering my mother, who was brutally murdered, to calling the police, I couldn't remember anything, like what I was doing or how much time had passed.

459
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:38,430
But 3 months later, it was my father who was arrested.

460
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:42,730
And my father was released from prison at the end of last year.

461
00:40:44,180 --> 00:40:48,930
The beginning of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident was on January 1st of this year.

462
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:54,150
All the victims were career employees and had been stabbed multiple times.

463
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,200
They resemble how my mother was killed.

464
00:40:58,600 --> 00:41:02,300
It seems the police suspect my father of committing another crime.

465
00:41:03,330 --> 00:41:06,280
I can't believe he betrayed his own father.

466
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:12,080
Why did I make this public now?

467
00:41:14,710 --> 00:41:17,680
Kinoshita Harumichi

468
00:41:18,950 --> 00:41:19,850
Yes?

469
00:41:20,150 --> 00:41:21,630
Have you read his article?

470
00:41:24,350 --> 00:41:29,030
I believe this article is for diverting suspicion away from Ikeuchi.

471
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:35,880
Shitara told me. It's easy to control public opinion.

472
00:41:38,650 --> 00:41:45,850
"When somebody makes a story, it begins spreading as the truth"

473
00:41:48,600 --> 00:41:55,430
Probably, he intentionally dropped a new story to attract public attention.

474
00:42:03,080 --> 00:42:04,200
Makoto?

475
00:42:05,300 --> 00:42:07,780
Sorry, I have to go.

476
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,330
What? Makoto!

477
00:42:14,450 --> 00:42:17,530
Makoto, don't go.

478
00:42:21,280 --> 00:42:22,150
Sorry.

479
00:42:23,450 --> 00:42:24,550
I love you.

480
00:42:28,330 --> 00:42:29,630
I've always loved you.

481
00:42:35,950 --> 00:42:37,030
I'm sorry.

482
00:42:41,930 --> 00:42:43,100
I'm sorry.

483
00:42:55,180 --> 00:42:57,500
I told you not to tell her impulsively.

484
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,150
Right...

485
00:43:23,580 --> 00:43:27,250
Why did I make this public now?

486
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:32,780
I think it's to make my position clear.

487
00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:38,350
That day, my everyday life collapsed.

488
00:43:39,530 --> 00:43:43,580
All of the normal things vanished from my life.

489
00:43:45,680 --> 00:43:47,730
I can't hope for a normal life anymore.

490
00:43:49,650 --> 00:43:53,250
That's what it means to get involved in the incident.

491
00:43:55,450 --> 00:44:03,130
If I want ordinary happiness while pretending to be someone I'm not, I have to keep building lies.

492
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:09,980
This is a life that belongs only to me.

493
00:44:22,900 --> 00:44:23,700
Yes?

494
00:44:24,500 --> 00:44:25,480
Where are you?

495
00:44:29,230 --> 00:44:30,330
I'm in front of your place.

496
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:34,150
Stay there, don't go anywhere!

497
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:45,430
This is the life I have to face, both as a journalist and a person involved in the incident.

498
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:53,350
I have no intention of sharing this fate with her and dragging her into hell with me.

499
00:44:57,150 --> 00:45:05,930
I wanted to admonish myself for desiring to be just an ordinary man.

500
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:20,380
Hiroki, I can't trust you.

501
00:45:26,600 --> 00:45:28,980
But no matter what, I can't let you go.

502
00:45:33,930 --> 00:45:39,800
Because...you love me so much.

503
00:46:01,980 --> 00:46:12,130
I want you...to smile all the time, but...

504
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:24,780
I wish we'd never met.

505
00:46:38,830 --> 00:46:46,830
Because people lie, it's hard to see what's true.

506
00:46:56,250 --> 00:47:05,250
If we trust each other and stay close, will this love become genuine?

507
00:47:07,730 --> 00:47:12,480
There's no ordinary happiness waiting at the end of this path.

508
00:47:14,830 --> 00:47:25,730
But even though I were to fall into hell tomorrow, I want you to love me.

509
00:47:35,420 --> 00:47:38,400
Owada

510
00:47:41,330 --> 00:47:42,580
Thank you for your hard work.

511
00:47:42,830 --> 00:47:46,450
Komine, how did it go?

512
00:47:48,350 --> 00:47:49,480
I died in battle.

513
00:47:49,750 --> 00:47:53,000
Oh no...Let's go for a drink!

514
00:47:53,350 --> 00:47:58,550
Please comfort me. By the way, where are you now?

515
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,600
I just wanted to check something.

516
00:48:03,980 --> 00:48:07,300
As I thought, Shitara Kanji isn't the suspect of The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

517
00:48:09,600 --> 00:48:12,430
After checking one more thing, I'll go back the the police station and explain it to you.

518
00:48:14,730 --> 00:48:18,200
Reset your feelings and move on to the next.

519
00:48:19,180 --> 00:48:25,400
What you're looking for may be closer than you think. You just can't see it yet.

520
00:48:27,730 --> 00:48:30,830
Be confident. You're an attractive man.

521
00:48:31,930 --> 00:48:35,400
What's with that all of a sudden? You're embarrassing me.

522
00:48:38,450 --> 00:48:40,250
See you later.

523
00:48:46,350 --> 00:48:49,950
Excuse me, may I ask you something?

524
00:50:00,100 --> 00:50:15,150
Next episode

525
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:01,880
Owada!

526
00:50:01,930 --> 00:50:04,450
She was killed because she got close to the truth about The Eye of Horus Murder Incident.

527
00:50:04,530 --> 00:50:06,280
Hiro, you're the only one I can rely on.

528
00:50:06,350 --> 00:50:08,300
There was an issue that the number of blood products didn't match.

529
00:50:08,380 --> 00:50:11,030
Everybody except you suspects Hiroki.

530
00:50:11,050 --> 00:50:12,730
The truth isn't decided by majority vote.

531
00:50:12,800 --> 00:50:14,650
I want to tell you the truth.
