00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:35,600
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,700
(Episode 1)

3
00:01:40,550 --> 00:01:42,229
Between Heaven and Earth,

4
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:44,090
all beings possess a spirit.

5
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,390
At the peak of the sacred Kunlun Ruins, there was a spiritual stone.

6
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:50,320
It absorbed spiritual energy from the three realms

7
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:52,120
and was tempered by divine fire,

8
00:01:52,310 --> 00:01:54,640
becoming a divine artifact

9
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:57,160
capable of reversing fate and resurrecting the dead—

10
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,680
the Thousand Years Token.

11
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,960
The Heavenly Realm feared that this divine artifact

12
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,080
would cause chaos among the three realms of Immortals, Mortals, and Demons.

13
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:08,000
So they sealed it within the Divine Hall,

14
00:02:08,020 --> 00:02:10,699
under the protection of the True Dragon God of War, Bai Yan.

15
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:21,880
However, in the Demon Realm, Xuan Yi, the Demon Lord of the Asura Clan,
harbored ambitious plans

16
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,600
to seize the Thousand Years Token

17
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:25,040
and rule over the three realms.

18
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:28,480
Xuan Yi led his demon army into the Heavenly Realm

19
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,120
and engaged in a fierce battle with Bai Yan.

20
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,090
Yu Qing, the High Immortal of the Winged Clan, loved Xuan Yi deeply.

21
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:37,840
In the end, she destroyed her primordial spirit

22
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,640
and crashed into the Thousand Years Token with Xuan Yi.

23
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:43,329
They perished together.

24
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:50,160
The God of War, Bai Yan, lured away the Thousand Years Token
with his own spiritual power

25
00:02:50,180 --> 00:02:52,100
and protected the living beings of the two realms.

26
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:55,000
Then, he used his Primordial Ice Divine Power

27
00:02:55,030 --> 00:02:58,280
and cast the token into the Wuwang Sea in Lijing Heaven,

28
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:01,990
sealing it with his primordial spirit.

29
00:03:02,290 --> 00:03:05,910
From then on, the Wuwang Sea lay frozen for ten thousand miles...

30
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:10,000
and the God of War, Bai Yan...

31
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,980
fell into slumber beneath the ice.

32
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,710
During this great war between immortals and demons,

33
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,890
the High Immortal Yu Qing committed the crime
of colluding with the Demon Realm,

34
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:27,890
and her clan, the Winged Clan of Danxue Mountain, was also implicated by her,

35
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,940
stripped of their divine status by the Heavenly Emperor's decree,

36
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,800
and removed... from the ranks of divine clans.

37
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,100
Grandpa Crane,

38
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,200
look at my pitch-black feathers.

39
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,800
They're not beautiful at all.

40
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:45,180
Why don't we...

41
00:03:45,890 --> 00:03:47,680
just not pluck it?

42
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,140
That's right.

43
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,610
I have only

44
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:53,070
these few decent crest feathers.

45
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:55,760
You old fool, you almost plucked them all.

46
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,240
I don't think

47
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:59,650
that the so-called Hundred-Feather Spirit Fan

48
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,100
seems to work at all.

49
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,440
-Right.
-That's right!

50
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,920
Yeah, Grandpa Crane.

51
00:04:04,940 --> 00:04:06,820
Nihuang already made two spirit fans

52
00:04:06,850 --> 00:04:08,650
but still couldn't summon her sister's primordial spirit back.

53
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,120
I think the spirit fan

54
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,200
is just useless.

55
00:04:11,220 --> 00:04:13,400
The previous fans might not have worked,

56
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:16,720
but perhaps this one will.

57
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:21,899
If Nihuang can summon her sister's primordial spirit back,

58
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,190
perhaps

59
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:27,100
our Winged Clan will regain its divine status.

60
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:36,930
Black Hawk,

61
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,020
what are you doing?

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:39,409
Put down the spirit feathers!

63
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,040
Helping her find her sister again?

64
00:04:41,420 --> 00:04:44,310
Her sister was a sinner who colluded with demons.

65
00:04:44,330 --> 00:04:45,130
Summoning her soul back

66
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:47,159
so she can bring calamity upon our Danxue Mountain again?

67
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:51,240
We're already shunned by all other immortal clans,

68
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,960
all because of her sister!

69
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,920
She's a freak born with plain, colorless feathers.

70
00:04:56,020 --> 00:04:57,760
I don't think she was even

71
00:04:57,760 --> 00:04:59,320
a true descendant of the Fire Phoenix bloodline!

72
00:04:59,960 --> 00:05:00,680
Black Hawk,

73
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:01,680
don't talk nonsense!

74
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:03,840
Nihuang's sister was once the Supreme Lord of Danxue Mountain.

75
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,160
Even if the Heavenly Emperor has punished our clan,

76
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:07,360
we should not disgrace our own!

77
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:08,280
What do you want?

78
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:09,600
Are you going to hit me?

79
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:35,840
Nihuang is here.

80
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:37,620
Nihuang.

81
00:05:38,159 --> 00:05:40,000
Your sister was punished by the Heavenly Emperor,

82
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,840
stripped of her divine status, and her soul was scattered.

83
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:43,440
Your Fire Phoenixes are no longer

84
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:45,400
the ruling clan of the Winged Clan of Danxue Mountain.

85
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,000
Black Hawk,

86
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,400
even the young fledglings of Danxue Mountain

87
00:05:48,420 --> 00:05:49,620
who have just grown their spirit feathers,

88
00:05:49,880 --> 00:05:50,960
understand the principle

89
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:52,680
of helping the weak against the strong

90
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,960
in the face of injustice.

91
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:56,240
How could I possibly stand by and do nothing?

92
00:05:57,050 --> 00:05:58,080
That's right!

93
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,040
Bullying the weak!

94
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,860
Teach him a lesson!

95
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,240
He deserves it!

96
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,480
You stupid birds,

97
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,420
you still dare to side with her?

98
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,060
Sooner or later, she'll bring you down with her,

99
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,240
and you'll face heavenly punishment again!

100
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,000
Nihuang stands up for us against injustice.

101
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,440
Why would Heaven punish her?

102
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:10,800
Exactly!

103
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,320
You should be punished!

104
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:14,140
You should be punished!

105
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,450
Yu Qing was a disgraced immortal!

106
00:06:15,470 --> 00:06:17,930
Yet she always wants to make some Hundred-Feather Spirit Fan

107
00:06:18,040 --> 00:06:19,440
to revive her sister!

108
00:06:19,460 --> 00:06:21,060
If the people at the Heavenly Realm find out,

109
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,280
they might scatter her primordial spirit as well!

110
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,280
And when that happens,

111
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:27,760
you'll all be kneeling at my feet,

112
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:28,860
begging for my protection!

113
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,780
You protect us?

114
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:32,490
With your meager cultivation?

115
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,680
What's wrong with my cultivation?

116
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,240
It's still better than your little flame-spewing trick.

117
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:38,640
Why are you putting on such airs here?

118
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:50,880
Black Hawk,

119
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,400
listen carefully.

120
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:54,700
Back then, my sister fell in love with the Demon Lord

121
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:55,800
because she was deceived

122
00:06:55,830 --> 00:06:56,710
and manipulated.

123
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:57,740
And now,

124
00:06:57,770 --> 00:06:59,290
I want to find her primordial spirit

125
00:06:59,530 --> 00:07:02,610
so I can take her to the Heavenly Realm and demand justice.

126
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:04,010
My sister committed no crime,

127
00:07:04,030 --> 00:07:05,430
so why was she punished?

128
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:08,090
It was also unfair to implicate the whole Winged Clan.

129
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:09,670
Once I've finished what I must,

130
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,630
our clan shall return to the ranks of the immortals

131
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,970
and no longer be scorned by other divine clans.

132
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,250
Nihuang,

133
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:17,310
this is not over!

134
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,640
One day,

135
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:20,500
I'll kick you out of Danxue Mountain!

136
00:07:30,140 --> 00:07:32,230
Thank you, everyone, for giving me your spirit feathers.

137
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,360
Nihuang.

138
00:07:34,250 --> 00:07:36,950
I support you in finding Yu Qing's primordial spirit

139
00:07:37,060 --> 00:07:39,180
because I don't want to see you live all by yourself.

140
00:07:40,350 --> 00:07:42,870
But the Heavenly Way has its own cycle of cause and effect.

141
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:44,480
We shouldn't force it.

142
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,720
Grandpa Crane,

143
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:47,480
with all of you by my side,

144
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,520
I'm not alone.

145
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:51,020
Now,

146
00:07:51,550 --> 00:07:53,230
you've had the feathers.

147
00:07:53,450 --> 00:07:54,330
This time,

148
00:07:54,670 --> 00:07:56,360
we must succeed.

149
00:07:57,400 --> 00:07:58,960
I've failed twice already,

150
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,300
but now I've discovered

151
00:08:00,330 --> 00:08:01,970
the secret method to use this fan.

152
00:08:23,580 --> 00:08:24,860
The spiritual resonance has grown stronger.

153
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,800
Could my sister's primordial spirit be right ahead?

154
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,000
Who are you?

155
00:09:43,030 --> 00:09:44,700
Why are you here?

156
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,490
You won't speak?

157
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:49,600
Then I'll silence you for good.

158
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,100
The barrier of Lijing Heaven remains intact,

159
00:10:35,430 --> 00:10:37,940
yet there are spiritual power disturbances inside.

160
00:10:38,020 --> 00:10:39,730
I can't check it clearly.

161
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,360
Seeing how fierce you were just now,

162
00:10:57,380 --> 00:10:59,260
I thought your cultivation was profound.

163
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:01,590
How did you revert to your original form so quickly?

164
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:05,090
It seems you've been frozen here for too long—

165
00:11:05,500 --> 00:11:07,400
your brain is frozen too.

166
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:23,800
Let me use my True Fire Hot Spring

167
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:25,500
to save you.

168
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,270
I heard...

169
00:11:36,910 --> 00:11:40,080
there have been unusual activities at Lijing Heaven.

170
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,500
Have you identified

171
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,090
the cause?

172
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:46,210
Your Majesty,

173
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:48,860
I have gone to Lijing Heaven to investigate personally.

174
00:11:49,390 --> 00:11:51,440
The barrier of Lijing Heaven remains intact,

175
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,280
but there seem to be strange flows of spiritual power inside.

176
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:56,440
I couldn't check it clearly, even with the Mirror of Reflection.

177
00:11:56,650 --> 00:11:59,200
Without Your Majesty's sacred entry token,

178
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,320
I dared not enter.

179
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:02,870
Are you certain

180
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:06,050
that there were no anomalies at the barrier?

181
00:12:06,170 --> 00:12:06,970
No.

182
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,360
Your Majesty,

183
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:10,960
back then, when the God of War Bai Yan

184
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:13,930
sealed the Thousand Years Token with his primordial body,

185
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,760
1,000 years had already passed.

186
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:19,440
Now that there are surges of spiritual power in Lijing Heaven,

187
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:20,920
it could be that the God of War's

188
00:12:20,920 --> 00:12:22,460
spiritual power has been revived

189
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:23,960
and he will awaken soon.

190
00:12:23,990 --> 00:12:27,440
If the God of War really wakes up,

191
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,110
it'll be a great thing for us.

192
00:12:33,950 --> 00:12:34,990
Divine Lord Yuanyou,

193
00:12:35,970 --> 00:12:38,410
just observe closely for a few more days

194
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:42,290
and do not disturb the God of War as he regathers his spiritual power.

195
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,130
Yes, Your Majesty.

196
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:25,650
So, she's just a little phoenix with poor cultivation.

197
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:29,330
But how could she break through the Lijing Heaven barrier

198
00:13:30,170 --> 00:13:31,690
and crack my seal?

199
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:34,490
What really happened?

200
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,050
This spirit feather seems familiar.

201
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:50,160
The disturbances in Lijing Heaven...

202
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:52,770
Is it truly because you're awakening?

203
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:19,890
Little white snake?

204
00:14:21,290 --> 00:14:22,090
Little white snake?

205
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,250
Little white snake!

206
00:14:27,890 --> 00:14:29,290
He's a grown snake.

207
00:14:29,810 --> 00:14:31,170
Where could he have gone?

208
00:14:31,890 --> 00:14:33,090
So blind.

209
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:40,690
You're awake.

210
00:14:40,810 --> 00:14:42,210
Do you know who I am?

211
00:14:43,330 --> 00:14:44,570
Of course, I don't.

212
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,730
I'm not some little white snake.

213
00:14:47,050 --> 00:14:48,030
I am a dragon.

214
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,650
I'm the renowned True Dragon God of War throughout the three realms...

215
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,350
Alright.

216
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:52,810
No matter who you are,

217
00:14:52,930 --> 00:14:54,850
I saved your life anyway.

218
00:14:55,210 --> 00:14:56,770
It seems you've recovered quite well.

219
00:14:56,770 --> 00:14:57,690
No need to thank me.

220
00:14:57,770 --> 00:14:58,530
I'll be going now.

221
00:14:58,530 --> 00:14:59,210
In all my years,

222
00:14:59,210 --> 00:15:00,970
no one has ever dared to interrupt me while I speak.

223
00:15:01,330 --> 00:15:02,450
Who exactly are you?

224
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:05,090
And why are you in Lijing Heaven?

225
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:07,410
You'd better answer my question honestly.

226
00:15:07,410 --> 00:15:08,450
Otherwise...

227
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:10,840
There are no windows or doors here.

228
00:15:10,890 --> 00:15:12,290
And there are no guards.

229
00:15:12,330 --> 00:15:13,850
Of course, I walked in.

230
00:15:14,090 --> 00:15:15,450
Walked in?

231
00:15:15,450 --> 00:15:16,210
That's right.

232
00:15:21,730 --> 00:15:23,650
You're saying that you walked in

233
00:15:24,410 --> 00:15:25,570
from outside Lijing Heaven?

234
00:15:26,570 --> 00:15:27,410
That's right.

235
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,090
How's the weather out there?

236
00:15:36,810 --> 00:15:37,610
Is it cold?

237
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,840
It's been 1,000 years.

238
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,290
There's finally light and warmth within the Lijing Heaven again.

239
00:16:15,370 --> 00:16:16,370
1,000 years?

240
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,330
You mean you were trapped in the ice for 1,000 years?

241
00:16:20,170 --> 00:16:21,010
Sleeping,

242
00:16:21,010 --> 00:16:21,850
not trapped.

243
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:25,210
What's the difference?

244
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,360
In other words,

245
00:16:29,610 --> 00:16:31,610
if I hadn't broken in,

246
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:33,930
you would have been trapped here forever.

247
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,530
No wonder the first thing you asked was whether it's cold outside.

248
00:16:38,770 --> 00:16:40,300
You still haven't answered my question.

249
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:42,530
How exactly did you get into Lijing Heaven?

250
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,250
My name is Nihuang.

251
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,730
I came because I lost someone dear to me.

252
00:16:50,290 --> 00:16:51,260
I heard

253
00:16:51,410 --> 00:16:53,490
that the Hundred-Feather Spirit Fan could bring me to the place

254
00:16:53,570 --> 00:16:55,090
where I can summon back the scattered primordial spirit.

255
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,050
But I didn't expect

256
00:16:57,850 --> 00:16:59,250
it would lead me here

257
00:16:59,850 --> 00:17:01,200
and break through your barrier.

258
00:17:06,970 --> 00:17:08,089
Where's my spirit fan?

259
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:16,050
Where is it?

260
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,650
What's with that look?

261
00:17:19,730 --> 00:17:20,849
You don't believe me?

262
00:17:23,770 --> 00:17:24,250
Fine.

263
00:17:24,250 --> 00:17:25,490
Whether you believe me or not doesn't matter.

264
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:26,810
I need to find my spirit fan.

265
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:28,770
Trying to escape?

266
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,450
What's the deal with you, little white snake?

267
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:33,650
I've saved you.

268
00:17:33,650 --> 00:17:34,370
I didn't ask for gratitude

269
00:17:34,370 --> 00:17:35,570
or repayment.

270
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,290
Yet, you keep interrogating me.

271
00:17:37,490 --> 00:17:38,650
As I said,

272
00:17:38,650 --> 00:17:40,370
I have important matters to attend to.

273
00:17:40,370 --> 00:17:40,970
Step aside.

274
00:17:40,970 --> 00:17:42,050
It concerns the safety of the three realms.

275
00:17:42,050 --> 00:17:43,170
You're not going anywhere

276
00:17:43,170 --> 00:17:44,170
until you explain it clearly.

277
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,170
The safety of the three realms?

278
00:17:48,370 --> 00:17:49,810
You think too highly of me.

279
00:17:53,210 --> 00:17:53,730
You...

280
00:17:57,410 --> 00:17:58,410
What's wrong with you?

281
00:17:58,730 --> 00:18:00,490
I saved you, and now you've left me frozen?

282
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,590
Let go of me!

283
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,540
Is there a demon beneath the ice?

284
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:55,970
Let me help you!

285
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:08,090
Leave now!

286
00:19:08,410 --> 00:19:09,570
I can't control it!

287
00:20:06,770 --> 00:20:07,570
Nihuang.

288
00:20:09,170 --> 00:20:09,970
Nihuang?

289
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:11,170
Nihuang.

290
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:12,970
Nihuang, wake up.

291
00:20:17,770 --> 00:20:19,770
I've saved you again.

292
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,210
I'm so cold.

293
00:20:56,690 --> 00:20:57,490
Wake up.

294
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,050
Wake up.

295
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,730
I'm cold...

296
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,930
so cold.

297
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:05,290
She's been affected by my Primordial Ice.

298
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,220
Transferring more of my spiritual power

299
00:21:07,850 --> 00:21:09,210
to her would only make things worse.

300
00:21:09,210 --> 00:21:10,150
Cold...

301
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,010
What's going on here?

302
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,570
Since you've rested,

303
00:22:56,930 --> 00:22:57,890
come with me.

304
00:23:00,770 --> 00:23:01,570
Hold on.

305
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:03,610
I'm just supposed to go with you like that?

306
00:23:07,330 --> 00:23:08,330
I'm afraid

307
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,460
I'll have to break your heart.

308
00:23:10,610 --> 00:23:12,210
Although we spent a night together,

309
00:23:12,610 --> 00:23:13,810
and I saved you,

310
00:23:14,290 --> 00:23:15,130
I...

311
00:23:15,890 --> 00:23:17,730
won't cling to you for that.

312
00:23:17,930 --> 00:23:19,650
Please don't offer yourself to me in gratitude.

313
00:23:20,410 --> 00:23:22,570
This is as far as we can go.

314
00:23:23,290 --> 00:23:24,140
Let's

315
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,850
forget each other.

316
00:23:26,150 --> 00:23:28,990
You can't leave until you explain why you

317
00:23:29,570 --> 00:23:30,490
broke into Lijing Heaven.

318
00:23:30,730 --> 00:23:32,410
Even if you want to keep me around,

319
00:23:32,770 --> 00:23:34,450
you don't need to keep saying the same thing.

320
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,330
I saved you,

321
00:23:36,350 --> 00:23:37,250
and you saved me.

322
00:23:38,010 --> 00:23:39,250
We're even now.

323
00:23:39,250 --> 00:23:40,770
I said, you can't leave.

324
00:23:41,810 --> 00:23:43,370
I'll help you find the fan

325
00:23:43,810 --> 00:23:44,970
you want.

326
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:48,170
My fan?

327
00:23:48,810 --> 00:23:50,250
You have my spirit fan?

328
00:23:51,210 --> 00:23:52,410
Where have you hidden it?

329
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,490
You'll get it back when the time is right.

330
00:23:55,970 --> 00:23:56,650
Let's go.

331
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,570
General God of War?

332
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,890
This is the General God of War!

333
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,010
Greet him now!

334
00:24:23,700 --> 00:24:25,390
-Greetings, General God of War!
-Greetings, General God of War!

335
00:24:28,450 --> 00:24:29,250
You may rise.

336
00:24:42,450 --> 00:24:43,210
Master,

337
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,210
you're finally back.

338
00:24:44,970 --> 00:24:46,050
Master?

339
00:24:46,650 --> 00:24:47,930
You even have a disciple?

340
00:24:48,570 --> 00:24:49,810
Welcome back, Master.

341
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,090
While I've been away,

342
00:24:52,090 --> 00:24:53,690
have you made any progress in your cultivation?

343
00:24:55,050 --> 00:24:58,010
I've been guarding the Yinhua Palace day and night, waiting for your return.

344
00:24:58,290 --> 00:25:00,170
How could I find the motivation to improve my cultivation?

345
00:25:00,370 --> 00:25:01,210
Excuses.

346
00:25:01,890 --> 00:25:02,530
Master,

347
00:25:02,530 --> 00:25:03,370
who is this?

348
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:05,610
This is a new disciple I took on beneath the ice plains

349
00:25:05,610 --> 00:25:06,730
of Lijing Heaven.

350
00:25:06,930 --> 00:25:08,330
She's new to this place and still learning how things work here.

351
00:25:08,330 --> 00:25:09,410
Take good care of her,

352
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:10,490
and don't let her wander off.

353
00:25:10,530 --> 00:25:11,690
I'm going to report to the Heavenly Emperor.

354
00:25:11,690 --> 00:25:12,490
I'll be back soon.

355
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:13,130
Yes, Master.

356
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:14,290
Disciple?

357
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,530
Since you're Master's new disciple,

358
00:25:18,530 --> 00:25:20,050
that makes you my junior.

359
00:25:20,770 --> 00:25:22,330
I'm not his disciple.

360
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:24,090
I'm his savior.

361
00:25:25,610 --> 00:25:26,570
Savior?

362
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:27,870
Are you serious?

363
00:25:28,050 --> 00:25:30,670
Master is the God of War who has saved all beings across the three realms.

364
00:25:30,730 --> 00:25:31,730
You saved him?

365
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:38,460
Welcome back, God of War!

366
00:25:44,650 --> 00:25:46,490
Welcome back, God of War!

367
00:25:50,530 --> 00:25:51,400
Your Majesty.

368
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:55,030
The God of War sealed the Thousand Years Token for 1,000 years

369
00:25:55,130 --> 00:25:57,180
and has finally awakened and returned.

370
00:25:57,250 --> 00:26:00,090
This is truly an auspicious sign for the three realms.

371
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:01,170
I'm flattered, Your Majesty.

372
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:03,490
Protecting the three realms is my duty.

373
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:07,770
It's been 1,000 years,

374
00:26:07,970 --> 00:26:10,210
yet you remain as radiant as ever.

375
00:26:10,410 --> 00:26:11,770
This battle robe is for you.

376
00:26:12,450 --> 00:26:14,090
You are most deserving of it.

377
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:15,570
Thank you for your generosity, Your Majesty.

378
00:26:15,570 --> 00:26:17,130
Congratulations on your return, God of War.

379
00:26:17,330 --> 00:26:18,210
For 1,000 years,

380
00:26:18,210 --> 00:26:21,410
your primordial body remained sealed beneath the vast ice plains.

381
00:26:21,530 --> 00:26:23,110
Now that you've awakened,

382
00:26:23,170 --> 00:26:24,530
how do you feel?

383
00:26:24,530 --> 00:26:25,450
Thank you for your concern.

384
00:26:25,890 --> 00:26:26,930
I'm fine now.

385
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:29,090
The God of War's return

386
00:26:29,170 --> 00:26:30,410
is a cause for celebration throughout the three realms.

387
00:26:31,490 --> 00:26:34,170
God of War, I've heard that a young immortal maiden

388
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:35,930
returned with you.

389
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:39,970
May I ask which immortal lineage she comes from?

390
00:26:41,330 --> 00:26:42,570
She's a small koi fish

391
00:26:43,250 --> 00:26:45,170
from beneath the ice plains of Lijing Heaven.

392
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:47,130
Later, nourished by my spiritual power,

393
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,130
she transformed into her human form.

394
00:26:48,170 --> 00:26:49,610
So, I took her as my disciple

395
00:26:49,610 --> 00:26:51,170
and brought her back here to continue teaching her,

396
00:26:51,250 --> 00:26:53,410
hoping she will soon achieve enlightenment.

397
00:26:53,570 --> 00:26:56,090
So, she is your new disciple.

398
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:57,490
That's wonderful news.

399
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,090
This is where you'll be staying.

400
00:27:06,970 --> 00:27:09,050
You really need to learn the rules properly.

401
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,040
Master is the True Dragon God of War.

402
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,490
I really can't understand why he would take on

403
00:27:12,510 --> 00:27:13,790
a disciple like you.

404
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:16,180
I've told you, I'm not his disciple.

405
00:27:16,210 --> 00:27:17,210
Back in Lijing...

406
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,250
-Qing He.
-Master.

407
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:23,010
It's a bit too cold inside this hall.

408
00:27:23,250 --> 00:27:24,930
Find a way to make it warmer.

409
00:27:25,010 --> 00:27:25,810
Oh, right.

410
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,450
Bring my purple-gold conch pot here too.

411
00:27:27,450 --> 00:27:28,610
-Go.
-Yes, Master.

412
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:35,890
If you dare to speak nonsense again in the future,

413
00:27:36,210 --> 00:27:38,250
I'll make sure you can never speak for the rest of your life.

414
00:27:39,290 --> 00:27:40,090
Also,

415
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:41,410
don't ever mention

416
00:27:41,450 --> 00:27:42,570
breaking into Lijing Heaven again.

417
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:43,370
Understood?

418
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:46,600
You can speak now.

419
00:27:47,850 --> 00:27:48,650
Why?

420
00:27:48,930 --> 00:27:49,850
Why?

421
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:52,970
Trespassing into Lijing Heaven incurs the punishment of the Tenfold Heavenly Thunder.

422
00:27:53,130 --> 00:27:54,130
Do you think you can withstand it?

423
00:27:54,530 --> 00:27:56,650
I'll explain everything to the Heavenly Emperor myself.

424
00:27:56,650 --> 00:27:58,370
It was that spirit fan that led me there.

425
00:27:58,370 --> 00:28:00,170
I had no idea there was any barrier.

426
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,450
Besides,

427
00:28:01,770 --> 00:28:03,610
your barrier was so weak.

428
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,450
I went in without even trying.

429
00:28:07,690 --> 00:28:10,090
Are you afraid that the Heavenly Emperor will blame you,

430
00:28:10,330 --> 00:28:11,890
so you're trying to get me involved too?

431
00:28:13,890 --> 00:28:15,370
Even if you hadn't broken into the barrier,

432
00:28:15,810 --> 00:28:16,890
just stepping into the Heavenly Palace

433
00:28:16,890 --> 00:28:18,090
as someone of the Winged Clan

434
00:28:18,090 --> 00:28:19,410
is already a grave offense.

435
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:20,890
You won't get away so easily.

436
00:28:22,210 --> 00:28:23,090
Winged Clan...

437
00:28:23,930 --> 00:28:25,450
How did you know?

438
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:32,570
Fine.

439
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,850
I can stop mentioning what happened in Lijing Heaven,

440
00:28:35,130 --> 00:28:36,450
but if even you can tell

441
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:37,730
I'm from the Winged Clan,

442
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:39,850
then the other immortals surely can too.

443
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,090
How can we possibly hide it?

444
00:28:42,130 --> 00:28:43,810
I've already explained to the other immortals

445
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,450
that you are just

446
00:28:44,450 --> 00:28:45,690
a small koi fish from beneath

447
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:46,770
the ice plains of Lijing Heaven.

448
00:28:46,970 --> 00:28:48,490
You took human form only after being nourished

449
00:28:48,490 --> 00:28:49,770
by my spiritual power.

450
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:52,290
Now you are one of my disciples.

451
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,490
A koi fish?

452
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,330
I'm a Fire Phoenix from Danxue Mountain.

453
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,530
You want me to pretend to be a fish?

454
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,050
I'm terrified of water!

455
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,970
Water and fire opposing each other makes the perfect cover.

456
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,610
I've already sealed your true form.

457
00:29:02,610 --> 00:29:03,930
No ordinary immortal will be able to see through it.

458
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,050
You sealed my true form?

459
00:29:11,290 --> 00:29:13,090
You really turned me into a fish?

460
00:29:13,930 --> 00:29:14,890
It stinks!

461
00:29:15,530 --> 00:29:16,610
Where are my phoenix feathers?

462
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:18,490
Give them back!

463
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:25,970
Could you at least change me into a different species?

464
00:29:26,090 --> 00:29:27,770
The smell is intolerable!

465
00:29:28,010 --> 00:29:29,410
Until the seal is lifted...

466
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:32,170
you can only remain a koi fish.

467
00:29:32,930 --> 00:29:33,970
True Dragon God of War,

468
00:29:34,090 --> 00:29:35,290
I'm begging you.

469
00:29:35,290 --> 00:29:36,850
When will you lift the seal?

470
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,170
When you leave the barrier,

471
00:29:39,210 --> 00:29:40,370
I'll naturally help you lift it.

472
00:29:40,370 --> 00:29:41,970
Then when will you let me leave?

473
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,250
My priority now

474
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:44,730
is to find my Hundred-Feather Spirit Fan.

475
00:29:45,490 --> 00:29:46,290
Oh, right,

476
00:29:46,370 --> 00:29:48,250
that day on the ice plains, you told me

477
00:29:48,610 --> 00:29:49,810
that you had a close relative.

478
00:29:50,290 --> 00:29:51,130
How close?

479
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,330
We relied on each other for everything.

480
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,680
Relied on each other?

481
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:58,610
Was he...

482
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:00,650
your husband?

483
00:30:01,650 --> 00:30:02,730
My older sister.

484
00:30:03,730 --> 00:30:05,250
My Hundred-Feather Spirit Fan

485
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:07,010
led me into Lijing Heaven.

486
00:30:07,290 --> 00:30:08,890
There must be a reason for it.

487
00:30:09,370 --> 00:30:10,890
If I hadn't saved you along the way,

488
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:12,050
I might have already found

489
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:13,730
her scattered primordial spirit.

490
00:30:14,610 --> 00:30:15,410
Right,

491
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:16,930
you are the True Dragon God of War.

492
00:30:17,090 --> 00:30:18,610
You must know my sister, right?

493
00:30:18,810 --> 00:30:20,540
Even though it's been a long time,

494
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:22,730
could you try to recall anything for me?

495
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:24,370
Perhaps I can find

496
00:30:24,490 --> 00:30:26,290
traces of my sister's shattered primordial spirit.

497
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:28,090
Your sister?

498
00:30:38,370 --> 00:30:39,170
Bai Yan.

499
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:41,010
This Yinhua Palace of yours

500
00:30:41,370 --> 00:30:42,770
is far too warm.

501
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:43,930
I don't think so.

502
00:30:44,330 --> 00:30:45,130
It's just right.

503
00:30:46,490 --> 00:30:47,490
Perhaps, after being...

504
00:30:48,410 --> 00:30:50,770
frozen for 1,000 years beneath the vast ice plains,

505
00:30:50,810 --> 00:30:51,850
you're afraid of the cold.

506
00:30:52,170 --> 00:30:52,850
Now that you're back,

507
00:30:52,930 --> 00:30:53,930
you naturally need to warm up.

508
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,770
For the sake of the three realms,

509
00:30:56,050 --> 00:30:56,850
Bai Yan,

510
00:30:57,170 --> 00:30:58,490
your sacrifices are immense.

511
00:30:59,450 --> 00:31:00,810
I don't ask for boundless merit.

512
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:02,050
I only wish to remain true to my heart.

513
00:31:02,250 --> 00:31:03,090
Originally,

514
00:31:03,170 --> 00:31:05,890
all the immortals wanted to visit you with me,

515
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:08,410
but considering you'd only just awakened

516
00:31:08,450 --> 00:31:09,770
and haven't fully recovered,

517
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:11,010
so I took the liberty

518
00:31:11,130 --> 00:31:13,000
of declining on your behalf.

519
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,210
That's for the best.

520
00:31:14,210 --> 00:31:15,570
You understand me best,

521
00:31:15,570 --> 00:31:16,770
knowing I'm not good at those things.

522
00:31:16,770 --> 00:31:17,850
Come on, have a seat.

523
00:31:19,970 --> 00:31:21,730
It's wonderful that you've awakened.

524
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:22,930
A few days ago,

525
00:31:22,930 --> 00:31:25,530
we found out that there were some sudden disturbances in Lijing Heaven.

526
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:28,810
We thought perhaps some demon was causing trouble again,

527
00:31:29,850 --> 00:31:32,010
but it turns out our God of War had regained his spiritual power

528
00:31:32,090 --> 00:31:33,290
and was about to awaken.

529
00:31:34,450 --> 00:31:35,410
Let me show you something.

530
00:31:40,290 --> 00:31:41,490
I found this artifact

531
00:31:41,490 --> 00:31:42,770
outside the barrier

532
00:31:42,770 --> 00:31:44,970
while inspecting Lijing Heaven recently.

533
00:31:46,930 --> 00:31:48,010
Although this fan

534
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,130
doesn't have much spiritual power,

535
00:31:50,650 --> 00:31:52,930
its appearance outside the barrier

536
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:54,850
is unusual.

537
00:31:55,570 --> 00:31:57,210
However, to avoid causing panic,

538
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,050
I didn't report to the Heavenly Emperor

539
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,330
before finding its owner.

540
00:32:02,410 --> 00:32:04,930
It's just a little fan with limited spiritual power.

541
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:06,490
Perhaps some minor immortal dropped it

542
00:32:06,690 --> 00:32:07,970
while passing through.

543
00:32:10,810 --> 00:32:11,730
Perhaps.

544
00:32:15,610 --> 00:32:16,450
Where is she?

545
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:17,770
Who?

546
00:32:18,930 --> 00:32:21,530
The disciple you brought back from the ice plains.

547
00:32:22,010 --> 00:32:25,410
To be nurtured by your spiritual power in Lijing Heaven—

548
00:32:25,450 --> 00:32:27,770
what a rare and lucky fate.

549
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:30,010
Shouldn't you let me meet her?

550
00:32:31,250 --> 00:32:33,610
She's just a koi fish with low spiritual power.

551
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:35,730
She's new here and doesn't know manners.

552
00:32:35,930 --> 00:32:38,010
I'm afraid if I introduce her now, she'll just be mocked.

553
00:32:38,050 --> 00:32:39,010
Perhaps it's better not to meet her.

554
00:32:39,130 --> 00:32:40,810
Since you've taken her as your disciple,

555
00:32:41,090 --> 00:32:43,490
surely, she'll have to appear here eventually.

556
00:32:44,130 --> 00:32:45,410
As your disciple,

557
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:46,170
shouldn't you

558
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:49,050
have her pay respects to other immortals?

559
00:32:49,770 --> 00:32:51,250
Keeping her hidden like this—

560
00:32:51,410 --> 00:32:53,210
does this new disciple of yours

561
00:32:53,210 --> 00:32:54,650
have something special about her?

562
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:57,490
Not at all.

563
00:32:57,890 --> 00:33:00,050
Her spiritual power is still weak, and she's reckless.

564
00:33:00,250 --> 00:33:02,170
I want to train her for some time

565
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:03,050
before introducing her

566
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,410
to you all.

567
00:33:07,890 --> 00:33:08,820
Qing He.

568
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,010
What's going on with your master?

569
00:33:11,050 --> 00:33:12,690
Why is it so hot in here?

570
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,370
It's not "my master."

571
00:33:14,370 --> 00:33:15,570
It's "our master."

572
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:16,810
Right.

573
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:17,810
Our master.

574
00:33:18,250 --> 00:33:20,570
He's just terrified of the cold after being frozen under the ice plains?

575
00:33:22,490 --> 00:33:23,290
Master said

576
00:33:23,610 --> 00:33:25,170
he hadn't felt

577
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:26,730
warmth for 1,000 years

578
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,890
and needed to drive away the chill within his body.

579
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,090
What's he doing over there?

580
00:33:32,090 --> 00:33:33,850
That's one of Master's long-standing habits.

581
00:33:33,850 --> 00:33:35,690
Every day, he soaks his feet in Milky Way water

582
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:36,770
to dispel dampness, drive away cold,

583
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:37,730
stabilize his essence, nourish his energy,

584
00:33:37,730 --> 00:33:38,770
and help him sleep peacefully.

585
00:33:40,850 --> 00:33:41,850
No wonder

586
00:33:41,970 --> 00:33:44,610
he can become a master who has lived for tens of thousands of years.

587
00:33:45,330 --> 00:33:46,730
He is so dedicated to health preservation.

588
00:33:46,730 --> 00:33:47,930
Indeed, one must take good care of their health.

589
00:33:48,810 --> 00:33:49,850
You're doing the whole health thing too?

590
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,090
You two, come over.

591
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:52,210
Okay!

592
00:33:58,810 --> 00:33:59,610
How is it?

593
00:33:59,770 --> 00:34:01,130
Comfortable, isn't it?

594
00:34:02,730 --> 00:34:03,530
Qing He.

595
00:34:03,730 --> 00:34:04,930
I'm a bit thirsty.

596
00:34:04,970 --> 00:34:06,130
Could you go fetch some water?

597
00:34:06,130 --> 00:34:07,850
I'm the senior, and you're the junior.

598
00:34:07,850 --> 00:34:09,050
If anyone should go fetch water, it's you.

599
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,210
I'm older than you,

600
00:34:10,210 --> 00:34:11,210
so I should be your senior.

601
00:34:11,210 --> 00:34:11,889
You go.

602
00:34:11,889 --> 00:34:12,850
I became Master's disciple before you.

603
00:34:12,850 --> 00:34:13,650
That makes me the senior.

604
00:34:13,650 --> 00:34:14,370
You go.

605
00:34:21,370 --> 00:34:22,170
Master,

606
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,929
what are you drinking?

607
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:24,929
Let me have a sip.

608
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,489
What is this?

609
00:34:32,630 --> 00:34:34,250
You dared to snatch Master's tea?

610
00:34:34,370 --> 00:34:36,610
Master drinks Bitter Lotus Seed Herbal Tea in the evening.

611
00:34:36,730 --> 00:34:38,010
In the evening?

612
00:34:38,090 --> 00:34:39,290
So there's a morning tea too?

613
00:34:39,290 --> 00:34:39,969
Of course.

614
00:34:39,969 --> 00:34:41,389
I'll explain everything to you in detail later.

615
00:34:41,530 --> 00:34:42,370
Starting tomorrow,

616
00:34:42,370 --> 00:34:44,010
you'll need to learn how to prepare tea for Master too.

617
00:34:44,530 --> 00:34:46,570
Master drinks three different kinds of tea each day.

618
00:34:46,570 --> 00:34:47,290
In the morning,

619
00:34:47,290 --> 00:34:48,929
we need to prepare White Jade Nectar Tea.

620
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,050
It can stabilize the spirit and replenish vital energy.

621
00:34:50,170 --> 00:34:50,969
After the midday nap,

622
00:34:50,969 --> 00:34:52,929
we need to prepare Cloud Mountain Longevity Tea

623
00:34:52,969 --> 00:34:54,010
to dispel internal heat and purge toxins.

624
00:34:54,290 --> 00:34:55,449
Before going to bed at night,

625
00:34:55,610 --> 00:34:57,570
it's this Bitter Lotus Seed Herbal Tea...

626
00:34:59,410 --> 00:35:00,570
To calm the mind and soothe the spirit.

627
00:35:00,590 --> 00:35:01,490
Remember that.

628
00:35:01,970 --> 00:35:04,170
You've lived for tens of thousands of years

629
00:35:04,610 --> 00:35:06,210
and have transcended life and death.

630
00:35:06,450 --> 00:35:07,650
Why still bother with these health practices?

631
00:35:08,050 --> 00:35:09,930
The three realms need me to live well.

632
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,090
Cultivating the body and mind

633
00:35:12,650 --> 00:35:14,450
is itself a form of spiritual practice.

634
00:35:23,690 --> 00:35:24,490
Qing He,

635
00:35:24,890 --> 00:35:27,170
isn't that tea for nighttime?

636
00:35:27,170 --> 00:35:28,450
Why are we gathering the lotus seeds now?

637
00:35:28,450 --> 00:35:30,530
Because they are the freshest before the morning dew evaporates.

638
00:35:30,530 --> 00:35:31,290
Hurry up and go.

639
00:35:31,530 --> 00:35:32,410
Me?

640
00:35:33,850 --> 00:35:35,450
I'm so clumsy.

641
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,650
If I mess it up,

642
00:35:36,690 --> 00:35:38,290
it might ruin Master's tea-drinking mood.

643
00:35:38,290 --> 00:35:38,930
You go.

644
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,170
I can learn more by observing you.

645
00:35:40,210 --> 00:35:41,730
What's there to learn about gathering lotus seeds?

646
00:35:41,730 --> 00:35:42,650
Anyone can do it.

647
00:35:42,690 --> 00:35:44,290
I've got to go back and prepare the morning tea.

648
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:45,410
Come back quickly after collecting them.

649
00:35:45,490 --> 00:35:46,730
Or they'll lose their freshness

650
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:47,890
and Master will be upset.

651
00:35:47,890 --> 00:35:48,610
I'm off now.

652
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:49,690
Don't go.

653
00:35:49,690 --> 00:35:51,450
I can just go back and prepare the tea instead.

654
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,490
You stay here and do it.

655
00:35:53,170 --> 00:35:55,530
Why do I get the feeling you're scared of something?

656
00:35:55,810 --> 00:35:57,050
You're not afraid of water, are you?

657
00:35:59,010 --> 00:36:00,250
Aren't you a koi fish?

658
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:02,210
In all my years,

659
00:36:02,210 --> 00:36:04,450
this is the first time I've ever heard of a fish fearing water.

660
00:36:04,850 --> 00:36:05,650
Nonsense.

661
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:07,290
Why would I be afraid of water?

662
00:36:07,370 --> 00:36:08,690
It's just that the morning dew hasn't evaporated yet,

663
00:36:08,810 --> 00:36:09,650
and I'm afraid of the chill.

664
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:11,450
You're so delicate.

665
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,330
How will you ever improve under Master's guidance?

666
00:36:13,370 --> 00:36:14,170
No way,

667
00:36:14,210 --> 00:36:16,290
you must collect the lotus seeds yourself today.

668
00:36:16,290 --> 00:36:17,410
I am your senior.

669
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,290
I cannot encourage such laziness and delicacy.

670
00:36:20,290 --> 00:36:20,970
Alright.

671
00:36:20,970 --> 00:36:22,890
I still need to prepare breakfast for Master.

672
00:36:22,930 --> 00:36:23,730
Go quickly

673
00:36:23,730 --> 00:36:24,770
and come back soon.

674
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:25,530
Don't play around.

675
00:36:25,530 --> 00:36:26,250
Bye.

676
00:36:33,130 --> 00:36:34,220
Bai Yan,

677
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,570
it's all your fault.

678
00:36:35,810 --> 00:36:37,470
Why did you have to turn me into a koi fish?

679
00:36:37,650 --> 00:36:39,230
How can I break this seal?

680
00:36:39,570 --> 00:36:41,370
The Winged Clan fears water most of all.

681
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:43,530
I'll die in the water!

682
00:36:54,090 --> 00:36:54,850
Master,

683
00:36:54,850 --> 00:36:55,730
you're up.

684
00:36:55,970 --> 00:36:57,050
I'll prepare tea right away.

685
00:36:57,890 --> 00:36:59,010
Why are you alone?

686
00:36:59,010 --> 00:36:59,650
Where's Nihuang?

687
00:36:59,650 --> 00:37:01,090
I sent her to Lotus Lake to collect some lotus seeds.

688
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:02,250
She's in the water?

689
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:02,970
Yeah.

690
00:37:04,050 --> 00:37:04,850
Bai Yan...

691
00:37:05,650 --> 00:37:06,450
come...

692
00:37:08,050 --> 00:37:09,250
come and save me...

693
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,010
Bai Yan...

694
00:38:02,700 --> 00:38:03,690
I finally understand

695
00:38:03,690 --> 00:38:05,370
why Master brought you back.

696
00:38:06,690 --> 00:38:07,770
You know everything now?

697
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:09,850
Do you know

698
00:38:09,850 --> 00:38:11,210
what the most tragic thing in this world is?

699
00:38:11,650 --> 00:38:12,450
What?

700
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:13,810
A bird that cannot fly

701
00:38:14,050 --> 00:38:15,170
and a fish that cannot swim.

702
00:38:15,930 --> 00:38:17,490
Despite being a koi fish,

703
00:38:17,530 --> 00:38:19,010
you almost drowned in the lake.

704
00:38:19,290 --> 00:38:20,170
If this

705
00:38:20,170 --> 00:38:21,290
were to happen to me—

706
00:38:21,290 --> 00:38:21,930
no,

707
00:38:22,330 --> 00:38:23,970
to anyone—

708
00:38:24,050 --> 00:38:25,250
it would be unacceptable.

709
00:38:25,650 --> 00:38:27,370
What's so unacceptable about it?

710
00:38:28,970 --> 00:38:30,050
Your near-drowning this time

711
00:38:30,130 --> 00:38:31,210
was my fault.

712
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,690
I just never expected

713
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:34,370
that a little fish fairy like you would nearly drown.

714
00:38:34,890 --> 00:38:36,490
Wasn't it all because of you?

715
00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:37,450
No,

716
00:38:37,450 --> 00:38:38,650
it was all because of your master.

717
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,850
He's your master too.

718
00:38:40,650 --> 00:38:41,450
Forget it.

719
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:42,410
Where is Bai Yan?

720
00:38:42,410 --> 00:38:43,210
Where is he?

721
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,010
The Heavenly Palace is too dangerous.

722
00:38:45,010 --> 00:38:46,410
I definitely can't stay here any longer.

723
00:38:46,410 --> 00:38:48,080
How dare you call Master by name?

724
00:38:48,330 --> 00:38:49,770
My master said that you can't leave!

725
00:38:52,770 --> 00:38:54,410
Ever since you've returned to Lijing Heaven,

726
00:38:54,930 --> 00:38:57,210
you've declined visits from various immortals.

727
00:38:57,970 --> 00:38:59,430
Why did you have the mood

728
00:38:59,650 --> 00:39:00,810
to invite me to your palace today?

729
00:39:01,450 --> 00:39:02,770
You guarded outside for 1,000 years

730
00:39:02,970 --> 00:39:04,410
while I slumbered in the ice plains.

731
00:39:04,490 --> 00:39:05,410
It's only right that I thank you.

732
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,130
Bai Yan.

733
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,930
You're not one for pleasantries.

734
00:39:11,370 --> 00:39:12,210
Whatever it is,

735
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:13,290
just say it.

736
00:39:14,370 --> 00:39:15,170
In that case,

737
00:39:15,410 --> 00:39:16,450
I'll be direct.

738
00:39:17,450 --> 00:39:18,890
That day, you mentioned

739
00:39:18,890 --> 00:39:20,850
finding a Hundred-Feather Spirit Fan

740
00:39:20,850 --> 00:39:22,410
outside Lijing Heaven beneath the ice plains.

741
00:39:23,330 --> 00:39:24,330
Could you give it to me?

742
00:39:25,130 --> 00:39:26,810
What do you want that fan for?

743
00:39:28,130 --> 00:39:29,040
Could it be

744
00:39:29,330 --> 00:39:31,450
that when you awoke beneath the ice plains,

745
00:39:31,450 --> 00:39:33,770
you also sensed the disturbances in Lijing Heaven?

746
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:43,570
It's Qing He who wants it.

747
00:39:44,050 --> 00:39:45,490
You watched him grow up.

748
00:39:45,490 --> 00:39:46,410
You also know

749
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,850
that he rarely asks me for anything.

750
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:51,090
If Qing He wants it, surely, he can have it.

751
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:54,930
However, I still need to investigate whether the disturbances in Lijing Heaven

752
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:57,570
are related to that Hundred-Feather Spirit Fan.

753
00:39:57,610 --> 00:39:58,410
Spirit Fan?

754
00:39:58,530 --> 00:39:59,490
What spirit fan are you talking about?

755
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,210
Silence!

756
00:40:00,610 --> 00:40:01,450
Don't be rude.

757
00:40:01,450 --> 00:40:02,210
Qing He,

758
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,090
take her away.

759
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,490
Is the spirit fan you mentioned...

760
00:40:06,130 --> 00:40:08,050
So this is the new disciple you just took on?

761
00:40:09,250 --> 00:40:10,210
She seems

762
00:40:10,530 --> 00:40:12,570
much more mischievous than Qing He.

763
00:40:15,810 --> 00:40:16,610
Qing He,

764
00:40:16,970 --> 00:40:18,610
I just asked Divine Lord Yuanyou

765
00:40:18,610 --> 00:40:20,610
for that artifact you wanted the most.

766
00:40:20,970 --> 00:40:23,250
However, since this artifact is tied to greater matters, and now is not the right time,

767
00:40:23,250 --> 00:40:24,140
we'll have to

768
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,890
postpone it for a while.

769
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,850
It's just a Hundred-Feather Spirit Fan.

770
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,170
If Qing He wants it,

771
00:40:33,050 --> 00:40:34,930
he can come get it after some time.

772
00:40:36,850 --> 00:40:38,410
Thank you, Divine Lord Yuanyou.

773
00:40:43,130 --> 00:40:43,730
Let's go.

774
00:40:51,490 --> 00:40:53,490
Can't you give Master some peace?

775
00:40:53,490 --> 00:40:54,690
Haven't you embarrassed yourself enough already?

776
00:40:54,690 --> 00:40:55,410
Qing He!

777
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,090
You may leave now.

778
00:40:57,690 --> 00:40:58,490
Yes, Master.

779
00:41:02,730 --> 00:41:04,210
Since you don't have the spirit fan,

780
00:41:04,210 --> 00:41:06,010
why did you trick me into coming here?

781
00:41:06,010 --> 00:41:06,890
I never said

782
00:41:06,890 --> 00:41:08,370
I had the Hundred-Feather Spirit Fan.

783
00:41:09,170 --> 00:41:09,690
Fine.

784
00:41:10,170 --> 00:41:11,130
But you did promise to

785
00:41:11,130 --> 00:41:12,810
help me get it back, right?

786
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,290
If that's the case,

787
00:41:14,450 --> 00:41:16,170
that immortal just now has my fan.

788
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,850
Why couldn't I get it back myself?

789
00:41:18,090 --> 00:41:19,650
And how would you plan to get it?

790
00:41:20,050 --> 00:41:21,210
Are you going to tell that Heavenly Emperor

791
00:41:21,210 --> 00:41:22,530
that the Hundred-Feather Spirit Fan is yours?

792
00:41:22,530 --> 00:41:23,290
That's right.

793
00:41:23,530 --> 00:41:24,770
It was mine to begin with.

794
00:41:24,810 --> 00:41:26,570
Then tell me, where did you lose it in the first place?

795
00:41:26,570 --> 00:41:27,210
Lijing...

796
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:33,210
Fine.

797
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,210
I know.

798
00:41:34,450 --> 00:41:35,530
I broke into the barrier,

799
00:41:35,530 --> 00:41:37,130
and I should be punished by the Tenfold Heavenly Thunder.

800
00:41:37,130 --> 00:41:39,050
I don't want to suffer that punishment.

801
00:41:39,290 --> 00:41:41,370
But that spirit fan is extremely important to me.

802
00:41:41,370 --> 00:41:42,370
I must get it back.

803
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,210
I've said

804
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:45,810
I'll figure out a way for you to get it back.

805
00:41:46,130 --> 00:41:47,370
But from today on,

806
00:41:47,450 --> 00:41:49,250
you are not allowed to step out of the Yinhua Palace.

807
00:41:49,250 --> 00:41:49,890
Why?

808
00:41:49,890 --> 00:41:51,370
Do you want to nearly drown again?

809
00:42:05,690 --> 00:42:06,930
If you really want to go out...

810
00:42:08,250 --> 00:42:09,490
you must have me with you.

811
00:42:10,090 --> 00:42:10,890
Let's do this:

812
00:42:11,330 --> 00:42:12,770
tomorrow, I'll take you to Mount Wuya...

813
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:14,650
to get some fresh air.

814
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,990
(Phoenix) (The king of birds, has long tail feathers with crystalline, bright crimson feathers interwoven with golden patterns.)
