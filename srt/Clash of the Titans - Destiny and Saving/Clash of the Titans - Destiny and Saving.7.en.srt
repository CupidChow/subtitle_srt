00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,640
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,680
(Episode 7)

3
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:42,400
It's up to me to decide
whether to use it or not.

4
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,280
Whether you give it to me or not
is up to you.

5
00:01:46,360 --> 00:01:47,360
If you don't give it to me,

6
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,920
you're valuing romance over friendship.

7
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,330
We'll talk about it later.

8
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:54,520
Alright.

9
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:55,590
It's getting late.

10
00:01:55,660 --> 00:01:56,520
I should get going.

11
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,220
On your way back,

12
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,410
you must be extra careful.

13
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:00,660
Don't let anyone find out.

14
00:02:00,800 --> 00:02:01,660
Don't worry.

15
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:16,230
Why are you following me?

16
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:22,190
I'll be passing by Mang Mountain on this journey.

17
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:22,880
At that time,

18
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:24,040
I'll bring Snowy over.

19
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,590
Go back.

20
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:31,040
Don't follow me.

21
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,970
Well, well.

22
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:40,000
Mo Xiao is the most promising disciple of the Shushan Sect in the Supreme Realm.

23
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:42,720
He is about to be affected by a little girl.

24
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:47,600
Supreme Lord.

25
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:50,880
Yeyuan said I am the Fallen God of the Nine Heavens.

26
00:02:51,770 --> 00:02:53,230
Immortality.

27
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:57,360
It's the Heavenly Emperor's punishment for me.

28
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,040
It's a curse.

29
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,770
Do you want me to feel honored by it?

30
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,400
What I want

31
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,530
is not immortality.

32
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,410
What I want is

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,550
to unite the three realms.

34
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,730
Supreme Lord.

35
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,200
Your power is boundless.

36
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,440
Your great cause will succeed.

37
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:18,880
You will surely unite the three realms.

38
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:21,320
So,

39
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:24,500
did you bring any good news for me?

40
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,140
Shushan Sect seems to have started investigating the snow demon.

41
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,040
Do we...

42
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:32,880
We were just shaking the trees and seeing what falls.

43
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:34,840
We've already found the path.

44
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,480
Why worry about the trees?

45
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,120
Supreme Lord,

46
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,840
you have been to Mang Mountain after all.

47
00:03:42,880 --> 00:03:43,800
It doesn't matter.

48
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,720
With their level of cultivation,

49
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:48,120
they can't find my traces.

50
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:49,400
Yes.

51
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:51,160
Supreme Lord, your power is boundless.

52
00:03:53,140 --> 00:03:54,100
Keep dancing.

53
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,940
That's the seat of the Young Sect Leader.

54
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,740
You got the meal ready so quickly.

55
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,320
Pack it for me.

56
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:10,680
Aren't you going to eat?

57
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:12,720
I'll take it back to eat.

58
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,600
I knew you'd be bored

59
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,880
in this place.

60
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,920
So I specially brought you my treasured novel.

61
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:48,800
How is it?

62
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:49,480
Is it good?

63
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:51,700
It's really good.

64
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,350
But when are you going to bring me a new one?

65
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:56,159
I'm almost done with this one.

66
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:56,800
Okay.

67
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:57,990
I'll bring you a new one tomorrow.

68
00:04:58,280 --> 00:04:59,780
If you really like it,

69
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:00,960
I'll take you down the mountain sometime.

70
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:02,760
We can go to the biggest bookstore
in Fengdu City,

71
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:04,120
and I'll let you borrow the latest novels.

72
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,720
But Mo Xiao doesn't allow me to go down the mountain.

73
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:09,120
You seem to listen to him quite well.

74
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:12,240
If I want to stay by his side,

75
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,640
I have to listen to him.

76
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:17,700
But after you're healed,

77
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,280
you'll have to leave here.

78
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,560
He is the future Sect Leader of the Shushan Sect.

79
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:22,700
He can't marry you.

80
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:25,200
I don't need him to marry me.

81
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,040
I just want to be with him.

82
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,360
You're really quite devoted.

83
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,920
Do you like him very much?

84
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:40,650
What does it mean to like someone?

85
00:05:44,390 --> 00:05:46,480
How should I explain it to you?

86
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,240
Liking someone...

87
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:50,280
Liking someone means that when you're with them,

88
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,560
you feel especially comfortable, secure, and at ease.

89
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,280
To you, he's

90
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:58,060
the one and only in this world.

91
00:05:58,650 --> 00:06:00,000
It's as if they were chosen for you by heaven.

92
00:06:00,020 --> 00:06:01,200
You're meant to be together.

93
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,080
You only want to be with them.

94
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:04,120
That's what it means to like someone.

95
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:06,280
Then I like him.

96
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:14,760
It's a tribulation.

97
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,260
A tribulation.

98
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:26,440
It's about time to practice some swordsmanship.

99
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:28,880
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

100
00:06:35,340 --> 00:06:36,390
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

101
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:39,870
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

102
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:51,290
Who are you?

103
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,320
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

104
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,120
My name is Zisu.
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

105
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,240
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

106
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:57,430
I'm the guardian of the Young Sect Leader.
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

107
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,630
You're Mo Xiao's guardian?

108
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,570
But he told me there's a barrier here,

109
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:04,720
and no one else can come in.

110
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:06,440
Did he send you here?

111
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:07,560
Yes.

112
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,770
Actually, you don't need to come.

113
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,320
I've got glutinous rice balls

114
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:14,680
and novels from Xie Lingyun.

115
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:15,520
That's enough.

116
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:16,440
You don't need to keep me company.

117
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:17,720
The Young Sect Leader might be worried

118
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:19,080
that you'd be too lonely here

119
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,080
in Xuanqing Court.

120
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,600
I've been used to being alone on Mang Mountain.

121
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:24,000
You don't need to accompany me.

122
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,200
You should go back.

123
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,360
Mang Mountain?

124
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:28,800
Could she be that demoness from Mang Mountain?

125
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,080
No wonder the Young Sect Leader has been acting strangely since returning from Mang Mountain.

126
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,290
If the Sect Leader and the Branch Leaders find out about this,

127
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,250
the Young Sect Leader will be punished severely.

128
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:38,530
No way.

129
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:39,930
I can't let her stay here.

130
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:42,840
Well.

131
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,120
The Young Sect Leader asked me

132
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:46,760
to take you to stay at Tiance Villa.

133
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:47,960
Tiance Villa?

134
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,560
But that's not what he said before.

135
00:07:50,580 --> 00:07:51,250
Perhaps

136
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:52,520
the Young Sect Leader is worried about you

137
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,800
being taken care of properly while he's away.

138
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,560
At least we can look after you there.

139
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:56,600
It's more convenient and safer.

140
00:07:56,960 --> 00:07:58,580
Don't you like eating glutinous rice balls?

141
00:07:58,720 --> 00:07:59,640
Have you tried them yet?

142
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:00,880
I made all of those.

143
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,910
You made those glutinous rice balls?

144
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:04,640
Well,

145
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:07,240
it will indeed be inconvenient for you to deliver them every day.

146
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,280
I'll go with you then.

147
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:09,480
Not now. Wait a moment.

148
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,280
Let me clean first, then I'll take you there.

149
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:15,480
Snowy.

150
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,320
Snowy!

151
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:08,960
Senior Lu.

152
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:11,950
Sect Leader.

153
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:14,570
I found a woman trespassing in the forbidden area.

154
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:15,520
I told her

155
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,320
that this is the Young Sect Leader's place of cultivation

156
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:18,740
and advised her to leave quickly,

157
00:09:18,870 --> 00:09:20,230
but she stubbornly refused to go.

158
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,190
She claimed

159
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,920
that the Young Sect Leader is eliminating demons for the people,

160
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:24,860
and she admires him.

161
00:09:24,890 --> 00:09:25,890
Absurd.

162
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:27,530
Bring her here.

163
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:27,580
(Virtue Through the Ages)
Bring her here.

164
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:29,940
(Virtue Through the Ages)

165
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,360
(Luntian Pavilion)

166
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,360
(Virtue Through the Ages)

167
00:09:46,970 --> 00:09:47,820
Zisu.

168
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:49,580
Why did you bring me here?

169
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,160
Who are you?

170
00:09:51,400 --> 00:09:54,000
Why did you trespass in the forbidden area of our Shushan Sect?

171
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:58,550
I understand now.

172
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,550
Mo Xiao never asked you to find me.

173
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:03,000
You were lying to me.

174
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,040
Does Mo Xiao know what you're doing?

175
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,740
You know Mo Xiao?

176
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,320
(Luntian Pavilion)
You know Mo Xiao?

177
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,720
(Luntian Pavilion)

178
00:10:11,720 --> 00:10:13,160
Who exactly are you?
(Luntian Pavilion)

179
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:15,330
My name is Wu Chen.

180
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:16,840
You tricked me into coming here.

181
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:18,120
What exactly do you want?

182
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,600
You trespassed into the forbidden area of our Shushan Sect.

183
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:22,840
What are your true intentions?

184
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,360
I told you that I didn't trespass.

185
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,920
Mo Xiao brought me here.

186
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:28,720
The Young Sect Leader is devoted to cultivation.

187
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:30,440
How could he possibly bring a mundane woman here?

188
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:32,200
Stop bothering our Young Sect Leader

189
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,560
and tarnishing his pure reputation.

190
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:34,960
Sect Leader,

191
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,240
please give the order.

192
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,620
I will escort her down the mountain immediately.

193
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:39,960
Zisu.

194
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,960
Hold your temper.

195
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:44,240
She's just a woman.

196
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,560
Yet she managed to break through our Shushan Sect's barrier.

197
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:48,720
This is quite an extraordinary event.

198
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:50,800
Junior Xuan Zhen,

199
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:53,000
come and verify this.

200
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,600
Senior Sect Leader,

201
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,320
I've confirmed that

202
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,880
this woman is indeed an ordinary mortal.

203
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,560
Since she is an ordinary person who entered by mistake,

204
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:31,440
and does not pose any threat to our Shushan,

205
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,480
I'll leave it to Zisu to handle.

206
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,520
Zisu.

207
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,080
You can escort her down the mountain.

208
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:36,960
Yes.

209
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:38,640
No way.

210
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:40,040
Mo Xiao brought me here.

211
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,180
If I have to leave, I want to leave with Mo Xiao.

212
00:11:42,360 --> 00:11:43,760
Since you already know

213
00:11:43,840 --> 00:11:45,130
that I pose no threat,

214
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,840
I'll just go back to Xuanqing Court then.

215
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,820
Stop right there.

216
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,920
Master has already ordered you to be sent down the mountain.

217
00:11:50,960 --> 00:11:51,760
Where do you plan to go?

218
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,520
Come with me.

219
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:53,720
No.

220
00:11:53,840 --> 00:11:54,560
Stop!

221
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:04,310
It's her. It's her.

222
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:05,800
She's the demoness from Mang Mountain.

223
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:07,920
Jianchuan.

224
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:09,680
What exactly is going on?

225
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:10,520
Master.

226
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:12,730
This is Wu Da. He's a villager from the foot of Mang Mountain.

227
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,160
He witnessed her

228
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,520
using demonic magic to freeze the villagers.

229
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,280
The villagers captured her,

230
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,720
intending to kill her.

231
00:12:19,280 --> 00:12:19,880
But...

232
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,240
Go ahead.

233
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:24,280
But the Young Sect Leader has been protecting this woman.

234
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:25,680
He even helped her escape.

235
00:12:26,250 --> 00:12:27,880
Now the junior disciples have discovered

236
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,480
that she's hidden in Xuanqing Court.

237
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:32,320
What?

238
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:34,200
I went to Mang Mountain

239
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:35,240
and confirmed this is true.

240
00:12:36,690 --> 00:12:38,410
If she really is a demoness,

241
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:39,770
Shushan

242
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,280
certainly can't let her go.

243
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:42,160
Senior.

244
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:43,960
I've already confirmed

245
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,910
that there is no trace of demonic aura on her.

246
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:50,140
Perhaps she practiced a concealment technique

247
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:51,880
to hide her demonic aura.

248
00:12:53,740 --> 00:12:56,160
Since we have a witness from Mang Mountain Village,

249
00:12:56,780 --> 00:12:59,020
bring her into the Tielyv Branch.

250
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,360
Sect Leader.

251
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,450
Why not wait for Mo Xiao to return first?

252
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,160
No.

253
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,120
Just arrest her.

254
00:13:05,240 --> 00:13:06,440
-Bring her into the Tielyv Branch.
-Yes.

255
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,360
You can't do this!

256
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,720
I must wait for Mo Xiao.

257
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,760
I've already told you.

258
00:13:10,920 --> 00:13:12,430
I came here for Mo Xiao.

259
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:14,250
I never harmed any of you.

260
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:15,800
Why are you treating me like this?

261
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:18,240
I value you as his fellow disciples.

262
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,960
I never meant to hurt you.

263
00:13:20,210 --> 00:13:21,930
But if you treat me this way,

264
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:23,240
I won't submit to your bullying either.

265
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:24,160
How dare you!

266
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:26,920
Shushan Sect vanquishes demons and upholds righteousness.

267
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:28,240
We never harm the innocent.

268
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:29,440
There is no bullying here.

269
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:31,720
As for your identity,

270
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,440
once you enter the Tielyv Branch of Shushan,

271
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,240
the truth will naturally come to light.

272
00:13:36,640 --> 00:13:37,440
Take her away.

273
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,240
I've said before.

274
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,240
I will wait for Mo Xiao.

275
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,240
I can protect myself.

276
00:13:42,930 --> 00:13:44,500
If you treat me like this,

277
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,070
don't blame me for being ruthless.

278
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,680
Demoness!

279
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:08,760
You

280
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:11,320
forced me to do this!

281
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:47,740
Mo Xiao.

282
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,120
Mo Xiao.

283
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:05,660
Wu Chen.

284
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,920
You've finally returned.

285
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:14,460
Master.

286
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,060
Mo Xiao,

287
00:15:16,200 --> 00:15:18,000
you've come back at the right time.

288
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:19,400
What explanation

289
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:20,880
do you have for this matter?

290
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,660
Zisu.

291
00:15:28,980 --> 00:15:29,630
Master.

292
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:32,140
Wu Chen is an orphan from Mang Mountain.

293
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:33,840
During my battle with the snow demon,

294
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:35,600
she was struck and poisoned by its cold toxin.

295
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,360
As a disciple of Shushan,

296
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,440
it's our duty to vanquish demons and protect the common people.

297
00:15:39,460 --> 00:15:41,620
So I have to save her.

298
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,880
I brought her back to the Shushan Sect.

299
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:44,220
If that's the case,

300
00:15:44,760 --> 00:15:45,960
you could have sent her

301
00:15:46,160 --> 00:15:48,410
to the Baicao Branch.

302
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,880
Why hid her in Xuanqing Court?

303
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:54,530
Master.

304
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:56,470
As you just witnessed,

305
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:58,320
when her cold syndrome erupts,

306
00:15:58,380 --> 00:16:00,230
the surrounding area turns into an extremely cold zone.

307
00:16:00,470 --> 00:16:01,810
To prevent

308
00:16:01,840 --> 00:16:04,230
her from harming innocent villagers and fellow disciples,

309
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:06,730
I took the liberty of bringing her back,

310
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:08,760
and began searching for a cure.

311
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,000
Sect Leader.

312
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,150
I can testify to this matter.

313
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,090
You knew about this too?

314
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,040
The Young Sect Leader informed me of this matter early on,

315
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,760
and entrusted me to help find a cure.

316
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,280
Wu Chen is not a demoness,

317
00:16:21,630 --> 00:16:23,650
and the cold aura is not demonic magic.

318
00:16:33,410 --> 00:16:34,110
Brother.

319
00:16:38,230 --> 00:16:39,180
Young Sect Leader.

320
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,020
I truly feel

321
00:16:41,240 --> 00:16:42,860
I've failed your trust.

322
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:44,340
But I truly don't know

323
00:16:44,360 --> 00:16:46,360
how Wu Chen was found.

324
00:16:46,390 --> 00:16:47,990
I had just delivered some glutinous rice balls to her,

325
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:48,770
and then went down the mountain.

326
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,140
Before I could return to the Tielyv Branch,

327
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,850
I learned that Wu Chen had been found.

328
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:54,040
I really didn't know at the time, Mo Xiao.

329
00:16:54,640 --> 00:16:55,160
You...

330
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:57,370
Young Sect Leader.

331
00:16:58,160 --> 00:16:59,120
It's me.

332
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:00,480
Zisu.

333
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:01,340
What are you talking about?

334
00:17:01,990 --> 00:17:03,560
How did you know about Wu Chen?

335
00:17:04,030 --> 00:17:05,160
Actually,

336
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:06,740
when you asked me for glutinous rice balls,

337
00:17:06,770 --> 00:17:08,180
I found it strange.

338
00:17:08,530 --> 00:17:09,329
After you left,

339
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:11,770
Young Master Xie also came asking for glutinous rice balls.

340
00:17:12,069 --> 00:17:13,290
I found it even stranger.

341
00:17:13,310 --> 00:17:14,270
So I followed him,

342
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:15,990
and discovered

343
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:17,930
that he went to Xuanqing Court.

344
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,950
You followed me?

345
00:17:20,339 --> 00:17:21,140
Young Sect Leader.

346
00:17:21,619 --> 00:17:23,010
When you just returned to the Shushan Sect,

347
00:17:23,130 --> 00:17:25,450
there were rumors that you protected a demoness in Mang Mountain.

348
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:27,770
When I saw Wu Chen in Xuanqing Court,

349
00:17:28,890 --> 00:17:29,890
I understood.

350
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:31,940
You knew I intentionally wanted

351
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,090
to keep Wu Chen in Xuanqing Court.

352
00:17:33,340 --> 00:17:34,980
Why did you deliberately lure her down the mountain?

353
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:36,380
Because I couldn't let her

354
00:17:36,410 --> 00:17:37,890
ruin your future.

355
00:17:38,370 --> 00:17:39,050
What do you mean?

356
00:17:40,350 --> 00:17:41,320
Young Sect Leader.

357
00:17:41,490 --> 00:17:43,540
You have been cultivated in Xuanqing Court since childhood.

358
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,330
Xuanqing Court is the sacred place of the Shushan Sect,

359
00:17:45,350 --> 00:17:46,950
the cultivation place of the Sword Sovereign.

360
00:17:47,310 --> 00:17:49,470
Even Shushan disciples are not allowed to set foot in it.

361
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,870
Yet you hid a strange woman there.

362
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:52,690
And...

363
00:17:52,870 --> 00:17:53,770
Keeping going.

364
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:58,980
Wu Chen kept saying

365
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,730
that she had feelings for you.

366
00:18:02,290 --> 00:18:04,730
If this gets to the Sect Leader

367
00:18:04,770 --> 00:18:05,730
and spreads through Shushan,

368
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:06,930
you'll become

369
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:08,590
the laughingstock of the entire sect.

370
00:18:09,050 --> 00:18:09,930
The three of us

371
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:11,770
have practiced with you for ten years since childhood.

372
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,970
Ten years of hardship led us here.

373
00:18:13,340 --> 00:18:15,650
I can't stand by and watch Wu Chen ruin you.

374
00:18:16,050 --> 00:18:16,730
Young Sect Leader.

375
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,310
It's all because I didn't think it through.

376
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:20,300
I was afraid you'd blame me

377
00:18:20,370 --> 00:18:22,010
if I sent her away before you returned.

378
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,440
So I thought if the Sect Leader knew,

379
00:18:24,490 --> 00:18:26,530
he'd expel her

380
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,090
as a trespasser.

381
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:30,200
I never meant to harm her.

382
00:18:30,230 --> 00:18:31,160
I never expected

383
00:18:31,250 --> 00:18:33,530
Senior Lu to bring a villager from Mang Mountain Village,

384
00:18:34,010 --> 00:18:36,290
and accuse you of harboring a demoness.

385
00:18:36,970 --> 00:18:37,770
Young Sect Leader.

386
00:18:40,090 --> 00:18:40,730
Young Sect Leader.

387
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:42,410
The Sect Leader has asked you to the Sword Pavilion.

388
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:44,090
Sword Pavilion?

389
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:48,530
At the Discussion Pavilion,

390
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:51,150
didn't the Sect Leader already settle this?

391
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:53,260
Why ask you to the Sword Pavilion now?

392
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,750
The Sword Pavilion has always been a sacred place of the sacrificial sword.

393
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,940
Unless it's a grave offense of betraying the sect,

394
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:00,260
Sect Leader wouldn't summon someone to the Sword Pavilion for questioning.

395
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:01,730
Since the matter has already occurred,

396
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:03,370
and it is indeed my fault,

397
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,670
I should be punished.

398
00:19:05,710 --> 00:19:07,550
(Sword Pavilion)

399
00:19:11,710 --> 00:19:13,550
Disciple Mo Xiao, here to receive punishment.

400
00:19:14,510 --> 00:19:16,170
And what are you being punished for?

401
00:19:16,910 --> 00:19:19,160
I failed to report Wu Chen's matter to you, Master.

402
00:19:19,670 --> 00:19:20,770
I should be punished.

403
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,460
I suspected someone was behind

404
00:19:28,990 --> 00:19:30,850
the snow demon's rampage.

405
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:34,510
That's why I sent your Senior Jianchuan to investigate secretly.

406
00:19:35,420 --> 00:19:36,780
Since you had doubts,

407
00:19:37,220 --> 00:19:38,950
why didn't you consult me?

408
00:19:39,150 --> 00:19:40,820
Why did you act on your own instead?

409
00:19:41,970 --> 00:19:43,350
It was my lack of consideration.

410
00:19:43,480 --> 00:19:44,680
I accept punishment, Master.

411
00:19:49,540 --> 00:19:50,490
Could it be...

412
00:19:50,880 --> 00:19:52,730
You have feelings...

413
00:19:53,170 --> 00:19:55,190
I have followed the Sword Sovereign in cultivation since childhood.

414
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:57,160
I swore before his spirit

415
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,730
to carry on his path,

416
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,690
to dedicate my life to cultivation and enlightenment.

417
00:20:00,730 --> 00:20:02,340
That vow has never wavered.

418
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:05,770
So saving her

419
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,450
was not out of personal desire?

420
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,410
Our great path

421
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:10,960
has absolutely no room for selfish desires.

422
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:14,290
Very well.

423
00:20:15,210 --> 00:20:17,690
Then swear it a hundred times

424
00:20:17,720 --> 00:20:19,020
before the Sword Sovereign's shrine

425
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,120
to comfort the Sword Sovereign's spirit.

426
00:20:24,740 --> 00:20:25,680
Disciple Mo Xiao

427
00:20:25,920 --> 00:20:27,050
hereby solemnly swear.

428
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:28,600
My life's purpose is to

429
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,980
carry on the will of the Sword Sovereign.

430
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:31,060
Suppress all emotions.

431
00:20:31,270 --> 00:20:32,230
Abandon all desire.

432
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:33,730
Dedicate my life to cultivation and enlightenment.

433
00:20:33,820 --> 00:20:34,940
Protect this world for all time.

434
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:42,840
Master.

435
00:20:42,910 --> 00:20:44,620
What are your orders?

436
00:20:45,570 --> 00:20:47,120
Didn't I summon Mo Xiao?

437
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,120
The Young Sect Leader was summoned by the Sect Leader and confined in the Sword Pavilion.

438
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:51,010
So...

439
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:56,730
Master, what's wrong with her?

440
00:20:56,930 --> 00:20:58,620
We must transfer primordial energy

441
00:20:58,650 --> 00:20:59,610
to her now,

442
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,890
to protect her heart meridian.

443
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:20,910
Master,

444
00:21:20,990 --> 00:21:22,730
she seems to be in more and more pain.

445
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:23,970
Zisu.

446
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,360
Help me transfer primordial energy.

447
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,030
Carry on the Sword Master's will.

448
00:21:31,160 --> 00:21:32,080
Suppress all emotions.

449
00:21:32,130 --> 00:21:32,810
Abandon all desire.

450
00:21:32,840 --> 00:21:33,930
Dedicate my life to cultivation and enlightenment.

451
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,010
Protect this world for all time.

452
00:21:35,260 --> 00:21:36,330
Carry on the Sword Master's will.

453
00:21:36,350 --> 00:21:37,210
Suppress all emotions.

454
00:21:37,330 --> 00:21:38,270
Abandon all desire.

455
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,250
Dedicate my life to cultivation and enlightenment.

456
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:40,330
Protect this world for all time.

457
00:22:04,610 --> 00:22:06,300
Such intense cold energy.

458
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:11,760
Zisu.

459
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,290
Go get the Sect Leader.

460
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,230
Wu Chen.

461
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:22,180
Wu Chen.

462
00:22:22,970 --> 00:22:23,720
Mo Xiao.

463
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:26,790
The Sect Leader entrusted her to the Baicao Branch.

464
00:22:27,110 --> 00:22:28,110
You can't take her away.

465
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,790
Her condition can't be treated with heated inner force.

466
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,140
Otherwise, it will endanger her life.

467
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:33,070
How do you know?

468
00:22:33,690 --> 00:22:34,420
Aunt,

469
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,110
let me take her away.

470
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:40,800
Mo Xiao.

471
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:43,810
How could you suppress her cold poison?

472
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:45,720
How did you do that?

473
00:22:46,410 --> 00:22:47,080
Aunt,

474
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,820
you've never cared for anything

475
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:49,570
beyond Baicao Branch.

476
00:22:49,820 --> 00:22:50,890
Please let me take her this time.

477
00:22:50,910 --> 00:22:51,630
She's dying.

478
00:22:51,930 --> 00:22:52,830
I beg you.

479
00:22:53,170 --> 00:22:53,770
No.

480
00:22:54,850 --> 00:22:57,180
I'm very interested in this girl now.

481
00:22:57,810 --> 00:22:59,520
I've been in charge of the Baicao Branch for decades,

482
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:01,510
and I've never seen such a peculiar condition.

483
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:04,330
I must find a way to cure her.

484
00:23:04,590 --> 00:23:05,380
Mo Xiao.

485
00:23:05,650 --> 00:23:07,090
I can't let you take her away.

486
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,940
Wu Chen, Wu Chen.

487
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,970
You can't save her at all!

488
00:23:18,180 --> 00:23:19,010
Young Sect Leader.

489
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:26,780
What's going on?

490
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:28,890
Wasn't that girl sent to the Baicao Branch?

491
00:23:29,090 --> 00:23:31,170
Why did the Young Sect Leader bring her back again?

492
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:34,760
Zisu, I'm asking you. What's happening?

493
00:23:35,570 --> 00:23:36,210
Tell me.

494
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:38,930
Will the Sect Leader still trust the Young Sect Leader after this?

495
00:23:43,770 --> 00:23:45,730
The extreme cold syndrome.

496
00:23:46,970 --> 00:23:47,930
Senior,

497
00:23:49,530 --> 00:23:50,770
did something come to mind?

498
00:23:51,490 --> 00:23:53,060
Do you remember

499
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,570
that little girl from eighteen years ago?

500
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,930
You mean

501
00:23:58,530 --> 00:23:59,690
the child who was born

502
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,610
with innate extreme cold?

503
00:24:02,010 --> 00:24:02,650
That's right.

504
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:06,690
Back then, Feng Xingtian left the immortal sects

505
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:08,730
and married a mortal woman.

506
00:24:08,770 --> 00:24:09,970
They had a daughter

507
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,810
named Lixue.

508
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,900
Senior, do you think

509
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:16,580
Wu Chen

510
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:18,870
is Feng Xingtian's daughter,

511
00:24:19,130 --> 00:24:20,130
Feng Lixue?

512
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:26,050
Then Mo Xiao...

513
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:27,850
What I fear most

514
00:24:28,230 --> 00:24:30,660
is that he has the same thoughts as me.

515
00:24:31,750 --> 00:24:33,170
This demonic power is extremely strong.

516
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,770
If someone in the world

517
00:24:36,060 --> 00:24:37,570
uses it to cultivate demonic magic,

518
00:24:38,160 --> 00:24:39,260
they

519
00:24:40,010 --> 00:24:41,890
will surely suffer a great backlash.

520
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:43,450
Then, there may be

521
00:24:44,290 --> 00:24:46,330
more like Feng Xingtian,

522
00:24:46,570 --> 00:24:47,690
coming to Shushan Sect

523
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:49,170
to seize the Millennium Token.

524
00:24:50,060 --> 00:24:51,370
The child carries

525
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:53,730
a strange power within him from birth.

526
00:24:53,910 --> 00:24:56,490
Today, I used the divine elixir to seal this power

527
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,210
and passed on to him the Fengyue Sword Technique.

528
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:01,350
When my time is up,

529
00:25:01,690 --> 00:25:03,460
you must protect her heart.

530
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,290
Do not let her inner demons rise again.

531
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,980
If a great calamity comes,

532
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:09,840
she will be the one to turn the tide

533
00:25:09,970 --> 00:25:12,330
and protect the Millennium Token.

534
00:25:12,660 --> 00:25:14,600
Only you shall know of this.

535
00:25:14,990 --> 00:25:17,010
You must not tell a second soul.

536
00:25:17,250 --> 00:25:19,410
Could the calamity the Sword Sovereign foresaw

537
00:25:19,430 --> 00:25:20,510
really be upon us?

538
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,050
No.

539
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:24,480
I cannot let this happen.

540
00:25:26,570 --> 00:25:28,370
This woman's identity is suspicious.

00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:43,050
♫The bell and homing swallows stir my heartstrings♫

558
00:25:43,050 --> 00:25:44,970
Only then can we ensure absolute safety.
♫The bell and homing swallows stir my heartstrings♫

559
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:45,340
♫Fingers linger on those words once more♫

560
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,210
Demon Subduing Palace?
♫Fingers linger on those words once more♫

561
00:25:46,210 --> 00:25:48,630
♫Fingers linger on those words once more♫

562
00:25:48,650 --> 00:25:54,780
♫I know the lines, not the tone, leave it to fate♫

563
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:58,560
♫Parted, reunited, replayed in the wind♫

564
00:25:59,210 --> 00:26:02,320
♫Vanished, reappeared, rising in dreams♫

565
00:26:02,470 --> 00:26:10,170
♫A sword in the eyes, a thread in the heart, unbroken♫

566
00:26:12,330 --> 00:26:15,500
♫Though just a moment, countless thoughts, unspoken, joy and grief entwined♫

567
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:16,320
Miss Wu Chen.
♫Though just a moment, countless thoughts, unspoken, joy and grief entwined♫

568
00:26:16,620 --> 00:26:19,270
♫Wipe away tears, never part, never leave♫

569
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:30,790
♫Drenched in a lifetime of rain, waiting for the perfect line, and for you, for you♫

570
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:32,850
Mo Xiao.

571
00:26:34,210 --> 00:26:34,850
You're awake.

572
00:26:35,730 --> 00:26:36,730
You're back.

573
00:26:39,900 --> 00:26:41,820
I knew you would come back.

574
00:26:45,890 --> 00:26:47,410
Where is this place?

575
00:26:47,810 --> 00:26:49,610
Why am I here?

576
00:26:49,730 --> 00:26:50,730
This is the Tiance Villa.

577
00:26:51,410 --> 00:26:52,130
Here's my room.

578
00:26:52,450 --> 00:26:53,090
Don't worry.

579
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,850
It's very safe.

580
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,330
I'm not afraid.

581
00:26:56,810 --> 00:26:59,130
Whenever someone tries to kill me,

582
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:01,050
you'll always come to save me.

583
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:02,570
I know.

584
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,160
Coming down the mountain with you

585
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:05,210
was the right choice.

586
00:27:09,380 --> 00:27:10,250
Actually,

587
00:27:10,330 --> 00:27:11,970
they are just my seniors and fellow disciples.

588
00:27:12,810 --> 00:27:14,410
Because they didn't understand the situation,

589
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,650
that's why they treated you that way.

590
00:27:15,810 --> 00:27:17,810
You don't need to explain to me.

591
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,130
I don't care anyway.

592
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,050
By the way, Wu Chen.

593
00:27:22,810 --> 00:27:24,170
Your cold syndrome had flared up again.

594
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:27,210
It's difficult to explain this to everyone.

595
00:27:27,610 --> 00:27:30,010
So Shushan may not be a safe place for you anymore.

596
00:27:30,890 --> 00:27:33,690
Just because my strange cold syndrome flared up,

597
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,850
they've labeled me a demoness

598
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:39,050
and wanted to kill me?

599
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,050
Shushan Sect would never kill the innocent.

600
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,530
But once they believe you're a demoness,

601
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:45,650
even I won't be able to protect you.

602
00:27:46,810 --> 00:27:47,450
Then,

603
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,410
are you afraid they'll hurt me,

604
00:27:51,170 --> 00:27:52,330
or

605
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:54,650
are you afraid they'll punish you?

606
00:27:58,170 --> 00:27:58,870
Well.

607
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:04,350
Mo Xiao.

608
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:06,770
Am I

609
00:28:07,670 --> 00:28:09,770
becoming a burden to you?

610
00:28:27,130 --> 00:28:27,730
Senior Lu.

611
00:28:27,750 --> 00:28:28,690
What are you doing?

612
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,010
By order of the Sect Leader,

613
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:32,010
I'm here to take the orphan Wu Chen.

614
00:28:32,330 --> 00:28:34,650
Tiance Villa is where the Young Sect Leader retreats for cultivation.

615
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,210
Without his summons,

616
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:38,490
no one is allowed to step inside.

617
00:28:38,730 --> 00:28:40,530
Even if you're following the Sect Leader's orders,

618
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,570
you should've informed us at the gates.

619
00:28:42,890 --> 00:28:44,230
Coming in like this,

620
00:28:44,410 --> 00:28:46,080
you've shown no respect for the Young Sect Leader.

621
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,250
Junior Zisu.

622
00:28:47,790 --> 00:28:50,010
I've come to take her by the Sect Leader's orders.

623
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,250
I apologize for the offense.

624
00:28:51,290 --> 00:28:52,330
Since you know you've offended,

625
00:28:52,750 --> 00:28:54,930
please leave Tiance Villa.

626
00:28:54,950 --> 00:28:56,940
How can I take her if I leave Tiance Villa?

627
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:58,570
You're forcing me to break in.

628
00:28:59,130 --> 00:29:00,530
Who dares to break into Tiance Villa?

629
00:29:06,720 --> 00:29:07,800
By order of the Sect Leader,

630
00:29:07,940 --> 00:29:09,360
I'm here to take the orphan Wu Chen.

631
00:29:09,770 --> 00:29:10,770
The Sect Leader heard

632
00:29:10,930 --> 00:29:12,980
that Miss Wu Chen's cold syndrome has flared up again.

633
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:14,910
And to prevent harm to fellow disciples,

634
00:29:14,990 --> 00:29:17,730
he has ordered me to take her back and settle her properly.

635
00:29:18,210 --> 00:29:18,770
Besides,

636
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,650
you have just been named the successor,

637
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,890
and are busy with sect affairs.

638
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:25,720
Treating an orphan

639
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:27,050
is not something you need to worry about.

640
00:29:27,330 --> 00:29:28,570
Thank you for the reminder, Senior Lu.

641
00:29:29,090 --> 00:29:30,690
However, Miss Wu Chen's

642
00:29:30,730 --> 00:29:32,130
cold syndrome has just flared up.

643
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:34,360
If you rashly approach and take her away now,

644
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:36,650
I'm afraid her cold syndrome might affect Senior Lu

645
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,930
and the others present here.

646
00:29:38,330 --> 00:29:41,200
Senior Lu, please report to the Sect Leader,

647
00:29:41,330 --> 00:29:43,210
telling him that Miss Wu Chen's cold syndrome has flared up.

648
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,090
Tomorrow morning,

649
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,910
I will personally take her to the Tielyv Branch

650
00:29:45,970 --> 00:29:47,250
to receive punishment.

651
00:29:47,530 --> 00:29:50,530
After that, I will go to the Sword Pavilion to continue my reflection.

652
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:53,550
For safety's sake,

653
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:54,860
Miss Wu Chen

654
00:29:54,970 --> 00:29:56,530
should stay at the Tiance Villa for now.

655
00:29:57,270 --> 00:29:58,190
What do you think, Senior Lu?

656
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:02,230
Since you have already made a plan,

657
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,520
I will go back and report to Master

658
00:30:04,780 --> 00:30:06,620
to put his mind at ease.

659
00:30:06,810 --> 00:30:07,730
Thank you, Senior.

660
00:30:08,130 --> 00:30:08,890
Please forgive me for not seeing you off.

661
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:15,870
But Miss Wu Chen's cold aura...

662
00:30:16,170 --> 00:30:17,610
If she leaves the Shushan Sect,

663
00:30:17,640 --> 00:30:19,890
she could harm innocent people wherever she goes.

664
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:22,470
Miss Wu Chen,

665
00:30:22,940 --> 00:30:25,020
why aren't you resting in your room?

666
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:26,730
Mo Xiao.

667
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,380
I'll go accept the punishment,

668
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:29,340
and stay here.

669
00:30:29,820 --> 00:30:30,870
Or I won't accept the punishment,

670
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:31,930
and leave this place.

671
00:30:32,810 --> 00:30:34,930
Which of these two outcomes do you prefer?

672
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:42,410
You injured Shushan Sect disciples in the Luntian Branch.

673
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,210
You should be punished.

674
00:30:45,410 --> 00:30:46,370
I understand.

675
00:30:46,450 --> 00:30:48,330
You mean I should stay.

676
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:50,960
Alright.

677
00:30:51,290 --> 00:30:52,210
Then I'll go accept my punishment.

678
00:30:52,690 --> 00:30:54,400
This is how you think, huh?

679
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,930
Tomorrow, I'll personally escort you to the Tielyv Branch.

680
00:31:33,650 --> 00:31:34,540
Mo Xiao,

681
00:31:34,910 --> 00:31:35,980
why are you here?

682
00:31:39,860 --> 00:31:41,110
Why do you look so pale?

683
00:31:41,140 --> 00:31:42,060
Give me a magical medicine.

684
00:31:48,500 --> 00:31:50,300
You're here so late at night,

685
00:31:50,330 --> 00:31:52,330
aren't you just here for magical medicine?

686
00:31:52,650 --> 00:31:54,650
You have a guardian from the Baicao Branch by your side.

687
00:31:54,690 --> 00:31:55,770
Surely you have all the magical medicine you need.

688
00:32:00,530 --> 00:32:01,750
I came to see you

689
00:32:02,060 --> 00:32:03,310
not just for medicine.

690
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,440
There's something else I want to ask for your help with.

691
00:32:05,970 --> 00:32:06,530
What is it?

692
00:32:15,330 --> 00:32:15,930
Here.

693
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:17,500
I made you some late-night snacks.

694
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:19,530
You're going to the Tielyv Prison tomorrow.

695
00:32:19,990 --> 00:32:20,790
Eat more.

696
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,040
Thank you.

697
00:32:28,690 --> 00:32:29,890
At a time like this,

698
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:31,320
you still have the mood to read novels?

699
00:32:31,490 --> 00:32:33,130
Aren't you worried or scared at all?

700
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:34,690
What do I have to worry about?

701
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:37,050
That's the prison that punishes demons in the Shushan Sect.

702
00:32:37,130 --> 00:32:39,290
Even those with cultivation can't escape unscathed.

703
00:32:39,310 --> 00:32:39,750
You...

704
00:32:43,020 --> 00:32:43,650
Never mind.

705
00:32:44,250 --> 00:32:45,490
You don't need to be afraid.

706
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:48,410
I've prepared all kinds of magical medicine from the Baicao Branch for you.

707
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:49,530
You won't die.

708
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:55,210
Why are you suddenly being so nice to me?

709
00:32:57,890 --> 00:32:59,130
Don't worry.

710
00:32:59,250 --> 00:33:00,890
Mo Xiao won't let anything happen to me.

711
00:33:01,770 --> 00:33:03,680
Please stop saying such things.

712
00:33:03,810 --> 00:33:06,080
The Young Sect Leader has faced so much criticism because of you.

713
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:07,450
He is

714
00:33:07,490 --> 00:33:09,290
a gifted sword immortal of his generation in the Shushan Sect,

715
00:33:09,370 --> 00:33:10,930
and you made him go kneel at the Sword Pavilion.

716
00:33:11,510 --> 00:33:12,490
If I were you,

717
00:33:12,570 --> 00:33:14,490
I would have already left on my own.

718
00:33:15,740 --> 00:33:17,450
Well, I can't help it.

719
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:19,210
He is my destined one.

720
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,010
I must be with him.

721
00:33:21,050 --> 00:33:22,610
You're still saying such things.

722
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,130
Tomorrow, you should be sent to the Tielyv Prison for punishment.

723
00:33:33,420 --> 00:33:36,000
You want the Trial Chart of Divine Machine Hall and the Purple Immortal Ribbon?

724
00:33:36,490 --> 00:33:37,610
The Trial Chart of Divine Machine Hall

725
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:39,770
records all the traps in the Tielyv Prison.

726
00:33:39,810 --> 00:33:40,930
And the Purple Immortal Ribbon

727
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,980
can shield you from punishment without harm.

728
00:33:43,670 --> 00:33:45,130
You want these two treasures.

729
00:33:45,450 --> 00:33:47,690
Is the Sect Leader going to punish you in the Tielyv Prison?

730
00:33:47,810 --> 00:33:48,570
Mo Xiao,

731
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:50,580
when did you start thinking about cheating?

732
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:51,850
Do you have them?

733
00:33:52,050 --> 00:33:53,500
I don't have them here.

734
00:33:53,690 --> 00:33:55,610
Both of those things are in the Divine Mechine Hall.

735
00:33:55,690 --> 00:33:57,050
It's full of traps inside.

736
00:33:57,290 --> 00:33:58,410
If you want to steal them,

737
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:01,050
you'll die before you even reach it.

738
00:34:01,090 --> 00:34:01,970
It's not that easy.

739
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,850
Is there any trap in this world

740
00:34:03,870 --> 00:34:04,770
that you don't know?

741
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,290
Well, there isn't.

742
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,010
But I'm the Young Master of the Tielyv Branch.

743
00:34:09,050 --> 00:34:10,050
It would be

744
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,210
rather unseemly for me

745
00:34:11,719 --> 00:34:13,150
to sneak around stealing things.

746
00:34:13,370 --> 00:34:14,250
If that's the case,

747
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,409
I'll go ask someone else then.

748
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:18,090
I haven't finished speaking yet.

749
00:34:18,110 --> 00:34:19,449
I'm not saying I can't go,

750
00:34:19,770 --> 00:34:22,050
but you're asking for

751
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,370
a big favor...

752
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,250
Go to Zimu

753
00:34:27,330 --> 00:34:28,850
and choose a magical artifact you like tomorrow.

754
00:34:29,370 --> 00:34:30,050
Deal.

755
00:34:36,570 --> 00:34:40,330
(Trial Chart of Divine Machine Hall)

756
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:41,929
(Demon Subduing Palace) (Mountain of Blades and Wall of Swords)

757
00:34:48,900 --> 00:34:49,620
Master.

758
00:34:50,290 --> 00:34:51,210
Do you have any new information?

759
00:34:51,230 --> 00:34:52,370
According to Floren's investigation,

760
00:34:52,389 --> 00:34:53,770
the Snow Demon of Mang Mountain has suddenly appeared,

761
00:34:53,790 --> 00:34:55,150
seemingly connected to the Demon Sect.

762
00:34:56,580 --> 00:34:57,520
Then,

763
00:34:58,090 --> 00:34:59,010
what about the orphan Wu Chen?

764
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:01,730
I still haven't found any information about her.

765
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:05,180
They've provoked the snow demon to cause trouble.

766
00:35:05,250 --> 00:35:06,270
The Demon Sect

767
00:35:06,570 --> 00:35:08,050
must be planning something big soon.

768
00:35:08,650 --> 00:35:09,530
Keep investigating.

769
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,090
Yes.

770
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:15,610
Wu Chen.

771
00:35:16,210 --> 00:35:17,090
Lixue.

772
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:20,020
Could she be related to the Demon Sect?

773
00:35:31,270 --> 00:35:32,060
Are you ready?

774
00:35:33,250 --> 00:35:34,050
Yes.

775
00:35:34,370 --> 00:35:35,890
I don't need to bring anything, right?

776
00:35:37,860 --> 00:35:38,490
That's true.

777
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:40,110
Then let's go.

778
00:35:40,890 --> 00:35:41,370
Let's go.

779
00:35:44,670 --> 00:35:46,460
Looks like I arrived just in time.

780
00:35:48,090 --> 00:35:48,730
I told you.

781
00:35:48,980 --> 00:35:50,100
I'm taking her with me.

782
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:52,290
The Sect Leader ordered me

783
00:35:52,490 --> 00:35:53,490
to fetch Wu Chen.

784
00:35:54,490 --> 00:35:55,470
Young Sect Leader,

785
00:35:55,930 --> 00:35:57,610
you need to go to the Sword Pavilion immediately for self-reflection.

786
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:07,210
I've given you the Purple Immortal Ribbon.

787
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:08,740
What else are you worried about?

788
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,380
Hurry to the Sword Pavilion.

789
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:12,100
Don't make the old man angry again.

790
00:36:13,070 --> 00:36:14,200
I'll take care of her.

791
00:36:14,450 --> 00:36:15,210
You can rest assured.

792
00:36:16,430 --> 00:36:18,610
You're now the Young Sect Leader of the Shushan Sect.

793
00:36:19,060 --> 00:36:20,020
You're personally

794
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:21,710
sending a girl to the Tielyv Branch.

795
00:36:21,850 --> 00:36:22,690
How unseemly.

796
00:36:27,110 --> 00:36:27,790
Don't worry.

797
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,540
Lingyun will accompany you.

798
00:36:29,930 --> 00:36:30,730
You'll be fine.

799
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:32,410
Are you going to be punished too?

800
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:34,780
You have your mistakes,

801
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:36,410
and I have mine.

802
00:36:37,150 --> 00:36:38,930
We both have to be punished

803
00:36:39,090 --> 00:36:39,970
for our mistakes.

804
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,140
I'll listen to you.

805
00:36:43,650 --> 00:36:44,170
Let's go.

806
00:36:49,020 --> 00:36:50,240
Wait.

807
00:36:52,750 --> 00:36:53,520
Be careful.

808
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,060
You all go with them.

809
00:37:09,450 --> 00:37:10,170
If anything happens,

810
00:37:10,910 --> 00:37:11,880
come find me at Sword Pavilion.

811
00:37:12,610 --> 00:37:13,210
Yes.

812
00:37:29,020 --> 00:37:30,080
Sect Leader.

813
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:46,370
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

814
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,060
Mo Xiao,
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

815
00:37:47,140 --> 00:37:47,840
bad news.

816
00:37:48,210 --> 00:37:50,280
The Sect Leader plans to send Wu Chen to the Demon Subduing Palace.

817
00:37:51,480 --> 00:37:54,700
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

818
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:07,200
(Demon Subduing Palace)

819
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,750
Mo Xiao said you would take me to the Tielyv Prison.

820
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:16,920
Why are we here?

821
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:19,770
The Tielyv Prison is only for punishment.

822
00:38:20,740 --> 00:38:24,290
But the Demon Subduing Palace can force you to reveal your true form.

823
00:38:24,940 --> 00:38:26,130
True form?

824
00:38:26,330 --> 00:38:27,590
What do you mean?

825
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:30,970
If you confess your true purpose for approaching Mo Xiao,

826
00:38:31,090 --> 00:38:32,890
and reveal your real identity,

827
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:34,490
perhaps

828
00:38:35,010 --> 00:38:37,210
I can make different arrangements for you.

829
00:38:37,650 --> 00:38:39,090
I've already said,

830
00:38:39,310 --> 00:38:40,940
I am Wu Chen from Mang Mountain.

831
00:38:41,290 --> 00:38:43,450
Mo Xiao is my destined one.

832
00:38:43,610 --> 00:38:44,610
I must follow him

833
00:38:44,630 --> 00:38:45,830
and can never be apart from him.

834
00:38:46,130 --> 00:38:47,570
What other purpose could I have?

835
00:38:47,590 --> 00:38:48,590
Nonsense.

836
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:52,410
As a disciple of the Shushan Sect, it is our duty to subdue demons.

837
00:38:52,490 --> 00:38:53,890
There's no such thing as destiny.

838
00:38:54,570 --> 00:38:55,810
You approached Mo Xiao

839
00:38:56,290 --> 00:38:57,770
with ill intentions.

840
00:38:58,530 --> 00:39:00,170
Mo Xiao is still young and inexperienced.

841
00:39:00,210 --> 00:39:01,210
He's been bewitched by you.

842
00:39:01,370 --> 00:39:03,970
But I have seen through your true nature.

843
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:07,520
I've already told you.

844
00:39:07,730 --> 00:39:09,970
Only Mo Xiao can dispel the cold aura in my body.

845
00:39:10,530 --> 00:39:12,130
You've seen it with your own eyes,

846
00:39:12,150 --> 00:39:12,770
haven't you?

847
00:39:12,890 --> 00:39:13,930
Why don't you admit it?

848
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,050
Mo Xiao inherits the Sword Sovereign's power of the Shushan Sect.

849
00:39:19,490 --> 00:39:20,690
It's nothing surprising that

850
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:22,010
he can dispel your cold aura.

851
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:26,290
I won't let you use this as an excuse again

852
00:39:26,370 --> 00:39:27,370
to manipulate Mo Xiao,

853
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:29,290
exploiting his compassion.

854
00:39:31,730 --> 00:39:32,410
Someone.

855
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:34,610
Take her in.

856
00:39:34,690 --> 00:39:35,210
Yes.

857
00:39:35,230 --> 00:39:35,930
Don't come any closer.

858
00:39:45,530 --> 00:39:47,010
Why do you want to separate us?

859
00:39:47,930 --> 00:39:51,130
Have you heard of the Battle at Snow Peak?

860
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,780
Have you heard

861
00:39:55,350 --> 00:39:57,940
of Feng Lixue?

862
00:39:59,850 --> 00:40:01,130
Snow Peak?

863
00:40:02,730 --> 00:40:04,170
Who is Feng Lixue?

864
00:40:04,190 --> 00:40:05,130
Lixue.

865
00:40:05,660 --> 00:40:06,820
You're Lixue, aren't you?

866
00:40:08,110 --> 00:40:10,740
Why is everyone talking about this name recently?

867
00:40:11,420 --> 00:40:13,500
The orphan from Mang Mountain.

868
00:40:14,050 --> 00:40:15,650
Before you came to Mang Mountain,

869
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,770
who were you?

870
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,600
I don't know.

871
00:40:22,250 --> 00:40:23,850
You're still pretending.

872
00:40:24,050 --> 00:40:24,810
Fine.

873
00:40:25,220 --> 00:40:26,840
I'm going to reveal your true colors.

874
00:40:29,650 --> 00:40:32,890
(Demon Subduing Palace)

875
00:40:34,450 --> 00:40:36,940
(Demon Subduing Palace)

876
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:39,530
You...

877
00:40:57,070 --> 00:40:57,980
Stop him.

878
00:40:59,680 --> 00:41:00,510
Get out of my way.

879
00:41:01,690 --> 00:41:02,770
Don't force me to take action.

880
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:04,370
Mo Xiao!

881
00:41:06,950 --> 00:41:07,570
Master.

882
00:41:07,650 --> 00:41:10,130
You're going to fight against your fellow disciples?

883
00:41:11,020 --> 00:41:11,670
Master.

884
00:41:12,040 --> 00:41:13,740
I was the one who brought Wu Chen back to Shushan.

885
00:41:13,770 --> 00:41:15,160
She's just an orphan.

886
00:41:15,290 --> 00:41:16,610
Why do you treat her like this?

887
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:18,450
You know exactly

888
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:20,090
why I must do this.

889
00:41:23,150 --> 00:41:23,810
Master.

890
00:41:24,290 --> 00:41:26,530
I have never asked you for anything since childhood.

891
00:41:26,730 --> 00:41:27,530
But this time,

892
00:41:27,730 --> 00:41:28,690
I beg you.

893
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:31,000
Please, let Wu Chen go.
