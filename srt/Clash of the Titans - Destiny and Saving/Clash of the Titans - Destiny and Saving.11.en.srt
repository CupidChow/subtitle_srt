1
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,690
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,700
(Episode 11)

3
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:56,120
That's strange.

4
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:59,000
Why is the Mind Stone not reacting at all?

5
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:06,140
Mo Xiao.

6
00:02:08,120 --> 00:02:09,759
(To save Wu Chen, open the barrier)

7
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,110
Let's go.

8
00:02:32,579 --> 00:02:33,460
Mo Xiao,

9
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,320
have you decided to open the barrier?

10
00:02:37,390 --> 00:02:39,510
You're making the right choice, Immortal Lord.

11
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,520
The Tianxing Secret Treasury was originally

12
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,610
the legacy of Feng Xingtian, the former leader of the Tianxing Sect.

13
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,880
Now that the Phoenix-masked Woman has announced to the world

14
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,790
that she will open this treasury,

15
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,000
others really have no place interfering, right?

16
00:02:50,840 --> 00:02:52,390
Immortal Lord, if you also want the treasure inside,

17
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:54,240
you can come with us to search for it.

18
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,320
Why make enemies everywhere

19
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,920
and offend us, right?

20
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,520
-Yeah!
-Exactly!

21
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:04,320
Where is Wu Chen?

22
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:06,320
Open the barrier first,

23
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:09,640
and then you'll naturally see Miss Wu Chen.

24
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,000
Where is...

25
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:14,520
Wu Chen?

26
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:15,800
Mo Xiao!

27
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,960
You Shushan Sect are so arrogant

28
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:18,970
that you don't even respect

29
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,280
the rules of the martial arts world, huh?

30
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:22,530
Since this is a trade,

31
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,160
naturally you need to open the barrier first, then we'll release the person.

32
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,790
Whether Wu Chen is released

33
00:03:28,079 --> 00:03:29,120
or dies

34
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,760
is now entirely up to you!

35
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:32,400
Yes, open the barrier!

36
00:04:06,520 --> 00:04:07,080
Mo Xiao,

37
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,320
have you gone mad?

38
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,530
If you don't hand over Wu Chen,

39
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:13,960
none of you will be leaving here today.

40
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:15,840
Are you really going to

41
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,279
violate the Shushan Sect's rules for Wu Chen?

42
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:19,950
I'll take full responsibility for any consequences.

43
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:21,350
What are you saying?

44
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,280
Do you think I'm afraid of getting dragged down with you?

45
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:24,760
If you want to save Wu Chen,

46
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:26,160
we can think of other ways.

47
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:27,720
But if you do this,

48
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:29,570
the news will quickly spread back to the Shushan Sect.

49
00:04:29,590 --> 00:04:31,360
Who knows what trouble it may cause then?

50
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,640
Mo Xiao,

51
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,640
you've always been calm and composed.

52
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:38,550
What's gotten into you today?

53
00:04:47,430 --> 00:04:48,350
Fine.

54
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,000
Whether it's hell

55
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:52,280
or high water,

56
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,250
I'll stand by your side till the end, brother.

57
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,370
Tell us!

58
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Where exactly is Wu Chen?

59
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:01,460
If you have the guts, kill me right now

60
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,320
along with everyone here.

61
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,800
I'd like to see how your Shushan Sect

62
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,980
maintains its place in the mortal realm after this.

63
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:23,370
Of course, we won't kill you.

64
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:25,340
But if you don't hand over Wu Chen,

65
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,560
then my Pagoda Bell

66
00:05:26,640 --> 00:05:27,770
will stay here with you

67
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,600
until you do so!

68
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:33,400
Master,

69
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,880
the Young Sect Leader's original purpose for this journey

70
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,080
was due to the emergence of the Tianxing Secret Treasury

71
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,620
and the martial arts conflicts it caused.

72
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,530
But now, the treasury hasn't appeared yet,

73
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,120
and the Young Sect Leader has already

74
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,330
made enemies out of every major sect.

75
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:44,320
This is truly damaging our Shushan Sect's reputation.

76
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:47,800
Sect Leader,

77
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:49,560
Jianchuan has a point.

78
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,560
As the Young Sect Leader of our sect,

79
00:05:51,920 --> 00:05:54,640
his every word and action represents us.

80
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,060
Yet he's been acting

81
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,880
so recklessly and impulsively.

82
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,960
How will he be

83
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:02,640
suitable to become our future Sect Leader?

84
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:04,280
What Mo Xiao has done

85
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,360
indeed violates our Shushan Sect's rules.

86
00:06:08,040 --> 00:06:10,960
If the Fengyu Branch hadn't immediately sent back the news,

87
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:13,920
who knows what trouble he would have caused.

88
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,960
However, at the Myriad Isles Ice Lake,

89
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,160
various sects from the martial arts world have gathered.

90
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,840
The situation there is complex and unpredictable.

91
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:22,840
It's difficult for us to determine what's behind it at this moment,

92
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:26,250
so we shouldn't jump to conclusions too early.

93
00:06:26,440 --> 00:06:27,040
Sect Leader.

94
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,560
Sect Leader,

95
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:32,560
disciples from the Tianyu Sect and the Penglai Sect request an audience.

96
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:35,440
What are they doing here at this time?

97
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,120
Please show them in.

98
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:49,560
My Pagoda Bell!

99
00:06:50,830 --> 00:06:51,700
Watch out!

100
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,000
Lingyun!

101
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,040
-Greetings, Young Master Feng!
-Greetings, Young Master Feng!

102
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,160
Mo Xiao,

103
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,520
you've seen it all, haven't you?

104
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:14,860
They have all already

105
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,680
pledged their allegiance to me for the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

106
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:18,310
And you?

107
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,280
Still self-righteously trying to save them

108
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,220
by guarding the barrier?

109
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,680
You took Wu Chen away.

110
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:24,520
No.

111
00:07:25,270 --> 00:07:26,720
To be precise...

112
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:30,620
it was they who offered Wu Chen to me.

113
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:37,400
What exactly do you want?

114
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:39,600
You want me to let them onto Tongming Island

115
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:41,040
and then just watch them

116
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,159
slaughter each other over the treasure?

117
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:45,320
Where is Wu Chen?

118
00:07:47,370 --> 00:07:49,900
I don't like making decisions for others.

119
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:51,720
I only like to offer choices.

120
00:07:53,080 --> 00:07:55,000
Now it's time for you to make a choice.

121
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:57,040
If you want to save Wu Chen,

122
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,680
you'll have to let them onto the island.

123
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:01,040
If you want to save them,

124
00:08:01,480 --> 00:08:02,840
you'll have to give up on Wu Chen.

125
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:06,560
Wu Chen or the masses,

126
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:08,720
make your choice.

127
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:10,560
The person you want to kill is me.

128
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,320
Take my life and let her go.

129
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,800
Wu Chen really means that much to you, huh?

130
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,860
Or are you planning to put on a righteous act

131
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:22,520
only to stab me in the back later?

132
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,920
I can prove it to you right now.

133
00:08:27,920 --> 00:08:29,160
If that's the case,

134
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:30,880
then come with me.

135
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,240
Mo Xiao, don't!

136
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,880
Don't come over.

137
00:08:33,640 --> 00:08:34,480
Go back to the inn and wait for me there.

138
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:42,960
Are you alright?

139
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:47,720
I'm fine.

140
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,560
Disciple of the Tianyu Sect, Si Nan, greets the Sect Leader.

141
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:04,760
Disciple of the Penglai Sect, Yue Yao, greets the Sect Leader.

142
00:09:05,280 --> 00:09:06,560
Two fellow cultivators,

143
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:08,600
what brings you

144
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:10,920
to Shushan at this time?

145
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:11,920
Sect Leader,

146
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,560
my master, Grand Master Qingyang,

147
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:14,920
has heard that your sect's Young Sect Leader

148
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:16,050
has gone to the Myriad Isles Ice Lake

149
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:18,650
intending to seize the Tianxing Secret Treasury alongside other sects in the martial arts world.

150
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,840
It has caused rumors throughout the world

151
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:22,360
that our righteous immortal sects are coveting the treasury.

152
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,040
So, he's specifically sent me to confirm if the rumors are true.

153
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,280
Has this matter already reached the Tianyu Sect?

154
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:28,400
Not just the Tianyu Sect.

155
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,640
Our Penglai Sect has always advocated for seclusion and cultivation,

156
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,800
not concerning ourselves with mortals' affairs.

157
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,040
We didn't expect

158
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:34,910
that we'd be dragged into this disgrace as well this time,

159
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,080
being insulted for no reason.

160
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,840
My master has also specifically sent me here

161
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:39,440
to demand an explanation from your Shushan Sect.

162
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,760
Masters from the Tianyu Sect and the Penglai Sect,

163
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,720
I wonder what kind of explanation you want.

164
00:09:45,880 --> 00:09:46,840
My master said

165
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,360
that whatever plans your sect has,

166
00:09:48,400 --> 00:09:49,720
we don't want to be involved,

167
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:50,840
nor do we want to know.

168
00:09:51,280 --> 00:09:52,720
Just before your sect takes action,

169
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,200
it's best to make it clear

170
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,040
that it's solely the doing of your sect,

171
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,400
not a unified action of all the righteous immortal sects.

172
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,880
That so-called Tianxing Secret Treasury is something

173
00:10:00,960 --> 00:10:03,120
our Penglai Sect wouldn't even deign to look at.

174
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,240
Junior, you speak your mind frankly,

175
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,840
which truly shows the Penglai Sect's manner.

176
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:09,200
However, there's something amiss in your reasoning.

177
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,010
The Shushan Sect, Penglai Sect, and Tianyu Sect

178
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,000
are revered by the world as the three leading immortal sects.

179
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,880
It's not that we've undeservedly claimed equal status.

180
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,400
Naturally, we don't need to explain ourselves to the world

181
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:17,870
that our sect is not on the same path as you.

182
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,320
If we were to deliberately promote it,

183
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:21,600
it'd only lead to people gossiping about discord among our three sects.

184
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:22,960
Moreover,

185
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:24,920
the Young Sect Leader was acting under the orders of the Sect Leader

186
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:27,410
to investigate the matter of the Tianxing Secret Treasury appearing in the mortal realm

187
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,600
in order to prevent a catastrophe in the martial arts world.

188
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:32,440
As for the Young Sect Leader's personal actions and methods,

189
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,680
if there's anything inappropriate,

190
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:36,120
we have our own sect rules to discipline him.

191
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,760
Junior, as you said,

192
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,160
the actions of one person

193
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:41,560
do not represent us all.

194
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:45,480
Everyone knows that he is the Young Sect Leader of your sect.

195
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,200
Is that not enough to represent all of you?

196
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:48,800
So, you're suggesting

197
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,280
that we should strip Mo Xiao

198
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,880
of his title as the successor to the Sect Leader,

199
00:10:52,280 --> 00:10:53,480
just to

200
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,000
distance our Shushan Sect from the entire

201
00:10:56,040 --> 00:10:57,200
righteous martial arts world?

202
00:11:03,040 --> 00:11:04,130
If Mo Xiao

203
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:06,320
cannot resolve this matter properly,

204
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,650
our Shushan Sect

205
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:10,680
will certainly reconsider our choice of successor.

206
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:30,600
Where's the Young Sect Leader?

207
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:33,240
Have you found Wu Chen?

208
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,240
We've searched everywhere.

209
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,440
There's no trace of her.

210
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:37,040
What's the point of searching for her right now?

211
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,800
Mo Xiao has been taken away by the Phoenix-masked Woman.

212
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,400
It's all that Wu Chen's fault.

213
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:42,600
We shouldn't have brought her along.

214
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,520
What did you say?

215
00:11:43,640 --> 00:11:44,640
What happened to the Young Sect Leader?

216
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:46,190
To save Wu Chen,

217
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,800
he let himself be taken by the Phoenix-masked Woman.

218
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,470
Stop right there.

219
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:52,880
The Young Sect Leader has already been taken away by the Phoenix-masked Woman.

220
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,000
Why are you still standing here and doing nothing?

221
00:11:54,080 --> 00:11:54,960
He's asked us

222
00:11:55,160 --> 00:11:56,160
to wait for him here.

223
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,040
He doesn't want us to risk our lives to save him.

224
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,920
I'm going to rescue him.

225
00:11:59,000 --> 00:11:59,640
No.

226
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,200
I'll say it again.

227
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:02,520
Stay right here and wait for him.

228
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:03,520
Don't go anywhere.

229
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:08,260
I'm fine.

230
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:11,000
Our mission is to protect the Young Sect Leader.

231
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,220
If you don't want to save him, Young Master Xie,

232
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:14,520
you can stay here.

233
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:15,520
We'll go rescue him.

234
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,120
He went with her willingly.

235
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,440
Think about it.

236
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,240
With Mo Xiao's cultivation,

237
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,800
if he wasn't willing,

238
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:24,160
how could he be easily taken away by the Phoenix-masked Woman?

239
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:26,400
Since he's asked us to stay here and wait for him,

240
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:27,640
he must have his own plans.

241
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,400
If we were to act recklessly,

242
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:30,960
that would only cause trouble for him.

243
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,540
Do you understand?

244
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,200
Where exactly have you hidden Wu Chen?

245
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,240
You care about her that much?

246
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:13,760
I don't have to see her.

247
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,080
But as long as you promise to release her,

248
00:13:16,840 --> 00:13:17,760
you can do whatever you want to me.

249
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:20,320
You're going all out just to save her.

250
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:22,800
Is it because you believe she's innocent?

251
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,920
Or because

252
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,080
you think she is Feng Lixue?

253
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:30,800
Mo Xiao,

254
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,520
you believed she was Feng Lixue long ago, didn't you?

255
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,900
You just couldn't figure out

256
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,680
why another daughter of Feng Xingtian

257
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:40,200
suddenly showed up at the Myriad Isles Ice Lake.

258
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,600
You wanted to confirm it.

259
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,000
Too bad; you were wrong.

260
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,520
She...

261
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:47,640
is just a pawn.

262
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:49,560
And I

263
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:51,720
am the real Feng Lixue.

264
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:53,320
I remember my hatred, my vengeance,

265
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:54,400
and the people I want to kill!

266
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:57,040
Whose pawn is she?

267
00:13:59,200 --> 00:13:59,840
Mo Xiao,

268
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:01,840
aren't you supposed to be clever?

269
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,000
You still can't figure this out?

270
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,720
You say you're the real Feng Lixue.

271
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,760
Then how have you managed to survive all these years?

272
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,600
Survive?

273
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:16,760
Good question.

274
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:19,350
How did I survive?

275
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,760
Ten years ago, I fell into that abyss.

276
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,400
It was like hell.

277
00:14:25,600 --> 00:14:26,080
No.

278
00:14:26,840 --> 00:14:28,640
It was worse than hell.

279
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:30,680
There wasn't even a ghost.

280
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:33,470
I couldn't have

281
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,720
any emotions,

282
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:37,260
except hatred!

283
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,960
Because only hatred reminded me

284
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,080
that I was still alive!

285
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:02,160
If I could bring Lixue back to life,

286
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,120
I would rather be the one...

287
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,960
to endure all of this.

288
00:15:10,720 --> 00:15:12,720
A promise that can't be kept is just a lie!

289
00:15:13,960 --> 00:15:15,400
If there's still a chance...

290
00:15:16,560 --> 00:15:17,200
No.

291
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,860
You have no chance now.

292
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:52,560
Suppress all emotions.

293
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:53,210
Abandon all desire.

294
00:15:53,240 --> 00:15:53,840
Dedicate my life to cultivation and enlightenment.

295
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:54,810
Protect this world for all time.

296
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:56,090
Suppress all emotions.

297
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,760
Abandon all desire.

298
00:15:56,840 --> 00:15:57,920
Dedicate my life to cultivation and enlightenment.

299
00:16:12,760 --> 00:16:14,080
The Shushan Sect barrier.

300
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:15,600
Star Lord,

301
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:17,320
this barrier was set by Mo Xiao.

302
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,720
He wants to prevent everyone from entering Tongming Island.

303
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,240
He thinks such petty tricks can stop me?

304
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,350
Star Lord,

305
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,740
this barrier was formed by Mo Xiao's Fengyue Sword.

306
00:16:34,920 --> 00:16:36,520
I'm afraid it can only be undone with that sword.

307
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:39,070
Then, let's find Mo Xiao.

308
00:16:48,900 --> 00:16:50,380
You are injured so badly.

309
00:16:51,380 --> 00:16:52,420
It's all my fault.

310
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:55,200
It's nothing.

311
00:16:55,530 --> 00:16:58,040
This little injury is nothing to me.

312
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,680
My dad used to whip me with an iron lash when I was a kid.

313
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,680
I'm used to it.

314
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,480
Besides, lucky I took

315
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:05,000
that palm strike for you.

316
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:07,000
If it had really hit you,

317
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:09,150
how would you

318
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:10,950
ever get married after that?

319
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,880
Are we just going to wait like this?

320
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,280
Since the Young Sect Leader told us to wait here,

321
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:38,040
we should listen to him.

322
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,240
The Young Sect Leader has always planned ahead.

323
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,040
He must have his reasons for arranging things this way.

324
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:45,370
I think we

325
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:46,960
should not act rashly.

326
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,290
But aren't you worried that something might happen to him?

327
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,360
He is the successor of the Fengyue Sword.

328
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,860
Unless he allows it,

329
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:54,560
no one can even scratch him.

330
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:55,920
See?

331
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,040
Even Zimu's more composed than you are.

332
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:10,320
What will it take for you to let Wu Chen go?

333
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:13,810
There is no need to rush.

334
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:15,840
I haven't finished torturing you yet.

335
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:17,840
When I've had my fill,

336
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:19,440
I'll kill you.

337
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:21,440
So, do you still think

338
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:23,680
you're in a position

339
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,800
to bargain with me?

340
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:28,160
You don't really want to kill me.

341
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:31,240
Oh? Do tell.

342
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,460
If you really wanted me dead,

343
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:35,000
you would have done it already.

344
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:38,050
You're hesitating because of something.

345
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:41,480
Something is holding you back.

346
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,000
Confident, aren't you?

347
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:45,080
Do you believe

348
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,840
I can kill you right now?

349
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:51,160
So, you are the Phoenix-masked Woman.

350
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:54,000
You're the one who sent out the Phoenix Feather Token

351
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,560
to open the Tianxing Secret Treasury?

352
00:18:56,280 --> 00:18:57,160
Who are you?

353
00:18:57,920 --> 00:19:00,400
Star Lord Ji Xingluo of the Dark Soul Palace of the Demon Sect.

354
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:04,440
Then this must be

355
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:06,220
Mo Xiao, the disciple of Sword Sovereign Fengyue.

356
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,330
Very good. Both of you are here.

357
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,400
That saves me the trouble of looking for you.

358
00:19:09,920 --> 00:19:10,640
You two,

359
00:19:11,050 --> 00:19:12,570
quickly open the barrier

360
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:14,040
and take me to the Tianxing Secret Treasury!

361
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,320
Just you?

362
00:19:16,800 --> 00:19:18,920
You think you can command me to take you to the Tianxing Secret Treasury?

363
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:33,000
Demonic technique?

364
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:34,280
Who are you really?

365
00:19:59,080 --> 00:19:59,960
Let's deal with this trouble first.

366
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,410
You and I

367
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,770
can settle our scores later.

368
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,680
Strange.

369
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:15,320
How does she know the techniques of the Demon Sect?

370
00:20:15,560 --> 00:20:16,000
Ziying.

371
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:16,680
Yes, Star Lord.

372
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:17,960
Look into this Phoenix-masked Woman

373
00:20:18,040 --> 00:20:20,150
and find out which palace on Mount Suyu she's connected to.

374
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:20,840
Yes, Star Lord.

375
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:52,810
You're one of the Demon Sect.

376
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:54,880
Cut the chatter.

377
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,660
I just need to kill you!

378
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,290
I'll spare you

379
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:06,830
for a few more days.

380
00:21:06,920 --> 00:21:07,950
I'll come for your life another day.

381
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:09,260
Hand over Wu Chen before you leave!

382
00:21:18,560 --> 00:21:19,240
Lingyun,

383
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,650
it's time to take your medicine!

384
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:34,280
Where is he?

385
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:43,920
Young Master Jing.

386
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,560
Zifeng,

387
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:46,320
have you seen Xie Lingyun?

388
00:21:46,840 --> 00:21:49,120
Isn't Young Master Xie in his room?

389
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,390
No, he's not.

390
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:52,520
Then...

391
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,440
he must have gone to the outhouse.

392
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:06,820
Chang Ming,

393
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,200
you dared to attack me?

394
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:09,720
If I hadn't stopped you in time,

395
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:12,320
were you going to kill him on your own?

396
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:14,600
He is still alive, isn't he?

397
00:22:14,720 --> 00:22:16,120
The Supreme Lord's patience with you

398
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,520
has run out.

399
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:39,720
He's not back yet.

400
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:41,240
The medicine is getting cold.

401
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,220
Where is he?

402
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:26,640
Xie Lingyun?

403
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:30,520
Xie Lingyun?

404
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:33,200
Xie Lingyun!

405
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,120
Jing?

406
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:40,880
What are you doing here?

407
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,080
Why are you here?

408
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:51,160
I've been looking everywhere for you.

409
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,840
If you don't come back now, the medicine will be completely cold.

410
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,520
You found it?

411
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:03,680
Such an important magical weapon from Shushan,

412
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,490
how could we just let it fall into the water like that?

413
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,810
To raise pearl oysters?

414
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,200
That's great.

415
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,250
I really thought I had lost it.

416
00:24:13,940 --> 00:24:14,680
Oh, right.

417
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,600
How is your injury?

418
00:24:16,760 --> 00:24:18,640
You just applied medicine and then got it wet.

419
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,880
Are you sure it's okay?

420
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:25,080
Oh, now you remember my injury?

421
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,360
You silly fool.

422
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:30,040
Are you really okay?

423
00:24:47,490 --> 00:24:48,770
If you don't come back now,

424
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,380
I won't apply medicine for you anymore.

425
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:04,560
You dared to change the plan without permission

426
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,320
and took Mo Xiao away.

427
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,520
Have you forgotten our agreement?

428
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:11,000
If it weren't for you,

429
00:25:11,170 --> 00:25:12,880
I would have already taken my revenge!

430
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:20,720
I told you

431
00:25:20,800 --> 00:25:22,530
I would help you open the Tianxing Secret Treasury,

432
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:23,910
and I will definitely do that!

433
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:25,360
But my business

434
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,720
is mine to decide!

435
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,760
Do you know why I made you wear a mask?

436
00:25:32,920 --> 00:25:34,600
Because you're meant to exist only in darkness.

437
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,390
Complete the plan for me as soon as possible.

438
00:25:38,720 --> 00:25:39,560
There will be time

439
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:41,440
for your revenge later.

440
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:44,230
If you dare to act on your own again,

441
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,840
I'll make sure your soul is utterly destroyed.

442
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:50,480
And one more thing:

443
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,640
you are not allowed to lay a finger on Wu Chen again.

444
00:25:54,040 --> 00:25:55,040
To me,

445
00:25:55,520 --> 00:25:56,760
she is more important than you.

446
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,380
I am the real Feng Lixue.

447
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:01,670
I am the real Feng Lixue!

448
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:24,800
Wu Chen?

449
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:28,840
Wu Chen?

450
00:26:29,160 --> 00:26:30,080
How could it be her?

451
00:26:41,640 --> 00:26:42,360
Mo Xiao?

452
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:50,840
Is Wu Chen alright?

453
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,240
She should just be unconscious.

454
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,440
I opened the Tianxing Secret Treasury

455
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:57,240
just to slay my enemies before my father's tomb.

456
00:26:58,120 --> 00:26:59,920
As for the treasures inside the hall,

457
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,520
they belong to everyone in the world.

458
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,280
Those of you who have the power,

459
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,200
go ahead and take them.

460
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,040
Everyone!

461
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,480
Feng Xingtian's daughter has said

462
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:12,200
that the treasure belongs to all!

463
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,880
No one can stop us from getting on the island today!

464
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,360
Mo Xiao,

465
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,000
these people have probably gone mad.

466
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,280
I don't think we can hold them off.

467
00:27:21,920 --> 00:27:23,340
Even if we can't hold them off, we must try.

468
00:27:23,490 --> 00:27:24,410
Take good care of her.

469
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:50,560
Wu Chen.

470
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,520
She has a phoenix-shaped mark on her body

471
00:27:58,080 --> 00:27:59,440
and also suffers from an unusual cold condition.

472
00:28:00,750 --> 00:28:01,450
Could it be...

473
00:28:03,540 --> 00:28:04,780
that she is the real Miss Feng?

474
00:28:28,070 --> 00:28:28,790
Wu Chen.

475
00:28:38,280 --> 00:28:38,760
Wu Chen?

476
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,390
Mo Xiao.

477
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,570
What kind of demonic art is that?

478
00:28:46,800 --> 00:28:47,960
Whatever it is,

479
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,900
let's get onto the island.

480
00:28:53,010 --> 00:28:54,900
Anyone who dares to step through this barrier,

481
00:28:55,070 --> 00:28:57,730
I'll use their blood to consecrate my Fengyue Sword!

482
00:28:58,150 --> 00:28:59,510
The barrier has been broken.

483
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,560
We can find another chance to get on the island.

484
00:29:06,520 --> 00:29:06,960
Let's go.

485
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:16,080
(Peach Blossom Villa)

486
00:29:16,920 --> 00:29:17,880
-Young Sect Leader.
-Young Sect Leader.

487
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:20,640
You three, go guard outside.

488
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:21,640
-Yes, Young Sect Leader.
-Yes, Young Sect Leader.

489
00:29:31,390 --> 00:29:32,850
Wu Chen's cold energy, which extends a hundred paces

490
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,000
around her and freezes everything in its path, really saved the day for us.

491
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:36,800
Otherwise, our Young Sect Leader

492
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:38,480
would have had to take action against the various sect leaders himself.

493
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:41,680
Didn't you notice anything strange?

494
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,720
It's not the first time her cold energy has erupted.

495
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:45,520
It was just more powerful today.

496
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:46,960
What's so unusual about that?

497
00:29:47,600 --> 00:29:50,400
Only our Young Sect Leader has ever been able to

498
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:52,440
control Wu Chen's cold energy, which freezes everything within 100 paces

499
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,320
in all directions.

500
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,520
Anyone who gets close will be frozen.

501
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:58,120
But... that Phoenix-masked Woman was unaffected.

502
00:29:59,880 --> 00:30:00,680
Really?

503
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,520
Is the Phoenix-masked Woman's cultivation really that profound?

504
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,470
What's even stranger is

505
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,080
that the Phoenix-masked Woman's Phoenix Feather Chain

506
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,680
didn't harm Wu Chen at all.

507
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,680
Yet, after this outbreak,

508
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,680
Wu Chen seems to have suffered a more serious backlash.

509
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,600
I've never seen the Young Sect Leader lose composure like this before.

510
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:15,520
Zisu,

511
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,560
don't you think so?

512
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,920
What's wrong with her now?

513
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:23,520
Why has she been so angry lately?

514
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:27,000
We used to stay only in Xuanqing Court with the Young Sect Leader.

515
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:29,320
Now that so many things have happened,

516
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,790
she's not used to it yet.

517
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:32,320
She'll get better gradually.

518
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:36,360
Supreme Lord,

519
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,640
we've brought Ji Xingluo back.

520
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,440
Which rule of the Heavenly Demon Sect have I violated

521
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,480
that you'd throw me into the Demon Prison?

522
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,120
I've never read

523
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:51,240
the rules of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

524
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,160
However, to me,

525
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:55,280
disobeying my orders

526
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:56,760
is breaking the rules.

527
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,560
And it's a grave violation at that.

528
00:30:59,790 --> 00:31:01,570
You're violent and tyrannical,

529
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,800
disregarding the ancestral teachings of the Demon Sect

530
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:05,920
and acting recklessly and arbitrarily.

531
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,890
Even when the former Demon Lord Yeyuan was alive,

532
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:10,400
he never acted like you.

533
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:14,320
Demon Lord Yeyuan entrusted the Heavenly Demon Clan to you,

534
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:16,520
yet this is how you treat its clansmen.

535
00:31:17,520 --> 00:31:19,560
Can you live up to the last instructions of the former Demon Lord?

536
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,180
Back then,

537
00:31:22,480 --> 00:31:24,760
if I hadn't promised my brother, Yeyuan,

538
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,960
not to kill any clansmen from your Heavenly Demon Clan,

539
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:29,280
do you think...

540
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:32,040
you'd still be alive now?

541
00:31:32,080 --> 00:31:32,640
You!

542
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:33,790
What?

543
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:35,870
Trespassing into the Tianxing Secret Treasury,

544
00:31:36,160 --> 00:31:37,160
disobeying my orders,

545
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,220
and still not behaving.

546
00:31:39,480 --> 00:31:40,760
You tell me,

547
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:43,620
should I send you to the Demon Prison

548
00:31:43,720 --> 00:31:46,080
to reflect on your behavior

549
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,640
and think about how to be a good

550
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,280
Dark Soul Star Lord of the Heavenly Demon Sect?

551
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,280
Chongguang.

552
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,680
You've already been plotting all along,

553
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,560
searching for our Heavenly Demon Clan's Sacred Stone.

554
00:31:59,000 --> 00:31:59,840
And you've known for a long time

555
00:31:59,860 --> 00:32:02,140
that the Sacred Stone was hidden in the Tianxing Secret Treasury, haven't you?

556
00:32:04,280 --> 00:32:07,280
Yet you pretend as if you've just found out.

557
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:09,440
Who knows what other

558
00:32:09,520 --> 00:32:11,680
shady schemes you're hiding behind our backs!

559
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:16,160
Too much talk.

560
00:32:18,260 --> 00:32:19,010
Chang Ming.

561
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:20,920
Take her to the prison.

562
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,600
Yes, Supreme Lord.

563
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,240
Take her to the prison.

564
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,000
Look,

565
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,760
such a beautiful face,

566
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,600
and she ruined it like this.

567
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:43,200
Yet, she still doesn't know what she did wrong.

568
00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:46,960
I...

569
00:32:47,400 --> 00:32:48,960
have never

570
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:50,600
tolerated imperfection.

571
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:57,190
This is how a beauty should look.

572
00:33:04,600 --> 00:33:05,440
Thank you, Supreme Lord.

573
00:33:06,070 --> 00:33:07,040
No need to thank me.

574
00:33:08,160 --> 00:33:09,360
Go back to your Dark Soul Palace

575
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,360
and be a good girl to wait for your Star Lord to return.

576
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:12,720
Yes, Supreme Lord.

577
00:33:16,180 --> 00:33:16,960
Well?

578
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:20,080
Do you two

579
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,920
also think I have some hidden agenda?

580
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:24,480
Demon Lord,

581
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,960
you're the leader of the Heavenly Demon Clan.

582
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,600
Whatever you do,

583
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:33,040
we believe it is for the good of us.

584
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,210
The position of Demon Lord

585
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,840
was entrusted to me by Yeyuan before his death.

586
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:44,820
I'm

587
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:46,280
not from your Heavenly Demon Clan.

588
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:47,960
To me,

589
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:49,570
being the Demon Lord

590
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:51,400
is like...

591
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:53,600
borrowing a boat to cross the sea.

592
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,240
So rest assured.

593
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,120
Sooner or later,

594
00:33:57,850 --> 00:34:00,570
I will return this position to one of your own.

595
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:24,409
Supreme Lord.

596
00:34:30,239 --> 00:34:31,219
Raise your head.

597
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,040
What's the matter?

598
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:35,280
Supreme Lord,

599
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:37,850
please allow me to serve you in the Formless Palace.

600
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:39,480
I'm willing to go through fire and water for you.

601
00:34:42,350 --> 00:34:43,790
So, you want to serve in my Formless Palace?

602
00:34:44,719 --> 00:34:46,320
Star Lord Ji treats me like a dog,

603
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,889
but you, Supreme Lord, showed compassion, spared me from punishment,

604
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:50,860
and even gave me a new face.

605
00:34:51,159 --> 00:34:53,360
I, Ziying, pledge my life to your service, Supreme Lord.

606
00:34:55,400 --> 00:34:56,880
Aren't you afraid that once Star Lord Ji

607
00:34:57,160 --> 00:34:58,560
comes out of the Demon Prison

608
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:00,260
and finds that you've switched loyalties,

609
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,760
she'll flay you alive?

610
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:03,520
To have your protection, Supreme Lord,

611
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,880
I fear nothing in this life.

612
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,440
Please grant me this wish, Supreme Lord.

613
00:35:17,430 --> 00:35:20,240
Although I despise disloyal people,

614
00:35:20,890 --> 00:35:22,370
I appreciate even more

615
00:35:22,600 --> 00:35:24,520
those who are wise and know how to adapt to circumstances.

616
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:26,040
You can stay.

617
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:29,480
Thank you, Supreme Lord.

618
00:35:35,810 --> 00:35:39,850
(Earth No. 1)

619
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:02,400
Her cold energy outbreak this time

620
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:04,520
is even worse than ever before.

621
00:37:25,400 --> 00:37:26,480
I can't worry about other things now.

622
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,320
Saving her life comes first.

623
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:34,040
Young Master Xie.

624
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:35,570
How is it?

625
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:36,810
Still no sign of anything?

626
00:37:43,290 --> 00:37:43,890
Well,

627
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:45,820
you all stay here on guard.

628
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:46,640
I'm going out for a while.

629
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,360
Young Master Xie,

630
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:48,560
where are you going at such a time?

631
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,200
What if something were to happen to the Young Sect Leader?

632
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:51,320
Hold your positions for three days.

633
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:52,440
Three days at most.

634
00:37:52,590 --> 00:37:53,590
I will definitely return.

635
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:03,280
Has Wu Chen... not recovered yet?

636
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,630
Young Master Jing, don't be afraid.

637
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,720
The Young Sect Leader is here.

638
00:38:07,760 --> 00:38:10,000
Miss Wu Chen won't have another cold energy outburst.

639
00:38:12,040 --> 00:38:13,120
I'm not afraid.

640
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,160
I'm just...

641
00:38:17,360 --> 00:38:18,530
a bit worried.

642
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:19,920
It's been almost three days.

643
00:38:20,350 --> 00:38:22,520
If this continues, the Young Sect Leader won't be able to hold on.

644
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:23,210
No,

645
00:38:23,240 --> 00:38:23,950
I have to stop this.

646
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:24,560
Zisu,

647
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,700
the Young Sect Leader is using his internal energy to heal Miss Wu Chen.

648
00:38:26,760 --> 00:38:27,920
If you barge in and interrupt like this,

649
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,320
you'll put both of them in danger.

650
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,090
You...

651
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:49,660
He...

652
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:50,630
I brought him here.

653
00:38:54,240 --> 00:38:55,480
The Divine Healer, Shi Bujiu.

654
00:39:09,850 --> 00:39:10,940
He's awake.

655
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,120
Young Sect Leader,

656
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:22,120
are you alright?

657
00:39:22,200 --> 00:39:22,880
I'm fine.

658
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,540
See?

659
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,270
I've got your person healed.

660
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,000
Where's the wine?

661
00:39:29,960 --> 00:39:30,560
Wu Chen...

662
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:31,960
save Wu Chen.

663
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:33,960
Actually,

664
00:39:34,040 --> 00:39:35,560
the person I asked you to save isn't him.

665
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,240
What?

666
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,680
Not him?

667
00:39:39,330 --> 00:39:40,350
What are you doing?

668
00:39:40,480 --> 00:39:41,360
I saved the wrong person.

669
00:39:41,520 --> 00:39:43,130
Naturally, I have to make him spit out

670
00:39:43,160 --> 00:39:43,800
my Nine Revive Soul-Restoring Pill!

671
00:39:45,120 --> 00:39:46,040
This person needs to be saved,

672
00:39:46,060 --> 00:39:47,410
and the other one needs to be saved too.

673
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,980
No, no, no.

674
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,970
We agreed to save one person, so that's it.

675
00:39:51,290 --> 00:39:51,920
I'm not saving anyone else!

676
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:53,400
Two more jars of peach blossom wine.

677
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,200
Make it four jars.

678
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,760
Four jars?

679
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,240
That's right.

680
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,000
It takes 3 full years to brew merely 10 jars of peach blossom wine!

681
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:01,880
You want them all?

682
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,680
10 jars then.

683
00:40:03,120 --> 00:40:04,560
Hurry up and save her. Save her.

684
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,960
10 jars?

685
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,100
Deal.

686
00:40:13,640 --> 00:40:14,280
Where is that patient?

687
00:40:21,760 --> 00:40:23,130
Looking at her complexion,

688
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:25,360
she doesn't seem to be seriously injured or anything.

689
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:27,080
Why did you have to make such a fuss

690
00:40:27,100 --> 00:40:28,460
and invite me here?

691
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,400
That's because our Young Sect Leader

692
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:31,880
transferred most of his inner energy to her,

693
00:40:32,080 --> 00:40:33,200
protecting her heart meridian.

694
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,090
You dragged me here,

695
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,670
yet you've already intervened and saved her halfway!

696
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,880
Who gets credit for saving her, huh?

697
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:41,840
I won't treat her, I won't!

698
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,800
You weird old man.

699
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,000
Just save people if you're going to save them.

700
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:47,680
Why so many conditions?

701
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:49,600
Could it be...

702
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,880
that your medical skills are not good enough...

703
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,960
so you're deliberately making excuses?

704
00:40:57,030 --> 00:40:59,170
You little girl,

705
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,680
this is the first time I've heard

706
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:03,040
someone dare to say that my, Shi Bujiu's, medical skills are not good enough.

707
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,360
Remember this:

708
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,920
if one day your life is hanging by a thread,

709
00:41:07,360 --> 00:41:09,480
I, Shi Bujiu, must be the one

710
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:11,390
to pull you back from the gates of hell.

711
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,120
Are you cursing me?

712
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,360
You're old but not honorable!

713
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:15,740
Stop arguing.

714
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:18,200
Divine Healer,

715
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:21,080
I've merely managed to preserve Wu Chen's heart meridian,

716
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:23,010
but the cold condition afflicting her

717
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,080
is beyond anyone's skill

718
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:24,880
but yours.

719
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:26,400
Please save her.

720
00:41:27,840 --> 00:41:28,940
You see?

721
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,920
He knows how to speak properly.

722
00:41:31,720 --> 00:41:33,680
Girls who aren't sweet-tongued

723
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:35,410
will suffer for it, you know!

724
00:41:35,440 --> 00:41:36,160
Alright.

725
00:41:36,480 --> 00:41:37,120
The Divine Healer needs a quiet environment

726
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:38,200
to treat his patient.

727
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:39,680
You all should leave now.

728
00:41:39,760 --> 00:41:40,280
Yes, yes, yes.

729
00:41:40,360 --> 00:41:41,120
Don't crowd around anymore.

730
00:41:41,240 --> 00:41:41,840
Go out first.

731
00:41:42,040 --> 00:41:43,120
Don't disturb him while he's saving her.

732
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:44,000
Out, out.

733
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,190
Call me if you need anything.
