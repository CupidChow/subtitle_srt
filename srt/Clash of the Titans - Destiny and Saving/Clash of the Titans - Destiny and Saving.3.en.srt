1
00:01:43,479 --> 00:01:44,120
What?

2
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,479
Void Cauldron.

3
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:49,000
Why is it the Void Cauldron?

4
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,000
Void Cauldron.

5
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,000
You want me

6
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:56,960
to vanish from the three realms forever,

7
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,680
don't you?

8
00:01:58,759 --> 00:01:59,560
Nihuang.

9
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,760
My sister was right.

10
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,440
Men are all heartless and faithless.

11
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:14,600
I trusted the wrong person.

12
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,160
For the sake of the three realms,

13
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:20,240
you toyed with me in the palm of your hand.

14
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:21,680
Nihuang.

15
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:25,680
Then I shall destroy the three realms!

16
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,560
Nihuang, Nihuang.

17
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,520
Demon spawn,

18
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,880
hand over your Core.

19
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:36,720
Nihuang.

20
00:03:08,240 --> 00:03:09,400
Sacred Flame?

21
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:18,640
Sacred Flame.

22
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:19,840
Primordial Ice.

23
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:22,960
With two divine powers of extreme yang and extreme yin mixed,

24
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,079
the Thousand Years Token will surely react.

25
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:26,360
Hold the demon girl.

26
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:27,920
I'll go protect the Thousand Years Token.

27
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:28,640
Yes.

28
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,880
This divine artifact

29
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,360
truly is extraordinary.

30
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:44,520
With the Thousand Years Token,

31
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,320
one can reverse heaven and earth,

32
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,800
bring the dead back to life,

33
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,560
and command the three realms.

34
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,160
Thousand Years Token.

35
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,640
The Thousand Years Token that can overturn the three realms.

36
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,320
Soon, I will obtain you.

37
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,160
Nihuang.

38
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:10,800
Why didn't you dodge?

39
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,680
Heavenly causality.

40
00:06:15,920 --> 00:06:17,840
I didn't expect that after cultivating for ten thousand years,

41
00:06:18,440 --> 00:06:20,440
I still could not escape fate.

42
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:22,800
But Nihuang,

43
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:24,880
I never lied to you.

44
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:27,880
What I promised you,

45
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,800
I will fulfill.

46
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,280
What is it?

47
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:13,680
I will use the Loong Pearl

48
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,600
to mask your flame aura,

49
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:19,840
cast you down from the Banished Immortal Terrace,

50
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,800
and made you mortal.

51
00:07:22,280 --> 00:07:24,960
From now on, no one in the three realms will find you.

52
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:26,280
No!

53
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:28,720
No!

54
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,560
Except me.

55
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:42,600
Divine Lord Yuanyou, Tuosang,

56
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,560
corrupted by the artifact's dark power,

57
00:09:45,960 --> 00:09:47,720
lost his mind,

58
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,200
and with a single thought, became a demon.

59
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,480
Today, your immortal roots shall be stripped.

60
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,040
You will be cast into the Realm of Unending Abyss,

61
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:02,600
where there is no life, no death,

62
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,920
no heart, no feeling,

63
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,640
no past,

64
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,000
no future,

65
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,080
to repent within the tribulation.

66
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,440
The Thousand Years Token has been sealed by the Heavenly Realm's God of War for a thousand years.

67
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,520
Now that the God of War has fallen,

68
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:37,720
and the Lijing Heaven Seal is broken,

69
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,600
by the order of the Heavenly Lord,

70
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:41,040
from this day forth,

71
00:10:41,280 --> 00:10:45,120
the Thousand Years Token shall be sealed beneath Mount Buzhou, in the Abyss of Infinity,

72
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:47,880
guarded by the Immortal Sect of Shushan.

73
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,360
You have slept within the Blood Demon Pearl

74
00:11:56,600 --> 00:11:58,400
for nearly a hundred years.

75
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,760
Now, at last, you can be reborn.

76
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:03,760
Who are you?

77
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,960
I am Yeyuan, Supreme Lord of the Heavenly Demon Clan.

78
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,880
Then who am I?

79
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:12,360
You are the Fallen God of the Nine Heavens.

80
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:13,880
A thousand years ago,

81
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:16,240
the battle over the Thousand Years Token in the Heavenly Realm

82
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:18,600
shook the three realms.

83
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,560
You were convicted and cast into the Realm of Unending Abyss.

84
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,720
Unwilling to accept your fate,

85
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,520
you destroyed your body,

86
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:31,040
but your primordial spirit escaped,

87
00:12:31,640 --> 00:12:34,080
falling to my Mount Suyu.

88
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,080
This must be destiny between us.

89
00:12:37,080 --> 00:12:38,960
Thousands of years ago,

90
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,880
our Heavenly Demon Clan was also driven out by the Heavenly Realm

91
00:12:41,160 --> 00:12:42,840
because of the Thousand Years Token,

92
00:12:42,960 --> 00:12:44,640
and we retreated to Mount Suyu.

93
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,000
Now,

94
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:49,600
I have used the Blood Demon Pearl to reshape your body,

95
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:51,880
restore your powers,

96
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:53,720
so that you will know

97
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:57,320
these thousands of years of grudges,

98
00:12:58,320 --> 00:12:59,680
I have not forgotten,

99
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,360
and neither can you.

100
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:04,600
From this day forth,

101
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:07,960
you shall be the Guardian of the Heavenly Demon Clan,

102
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,640
Chongguang.

103
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,560
Guardian of the Heavenly Demon Clan,

104
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:14,920
Chongguang.

105
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,080
This name

106
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,000
doesn't sound too bad.

107
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:21,400
You are reborn today,

108
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:24,000
with hope of seeing light again.

109
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,200
So,

110
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,360
what do you need me

111
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:03,720
to do for you?

112
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:07,480
Not for me,

113
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:09,680
for us.

114
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,880
If one day you and I work together

115
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,640
to overturn heaven and earth

116
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,640
and avenge our humiliation,

117
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,920
would you be willing?

118
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:22,480
Though

119
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,400
I've lost all memories of the Heavenly Realm,

120
00:14:26,960 --> 00:14:28,880
the hatred from the destruction of my divine soul

121
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:32,880
is a debt I must repay.

122
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,040
Good.

123
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:37,200
Together,

124
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:39,960
we shall sweep across the Nine Heavens

125
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,360
and redraw the three realms.

126
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:45,360
Sounds

127
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:46,960
not too bad.

128
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:50,480
But,

129
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:52,760
to sweep the Nine Heavens,

130
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,800
we still need one thing.

131
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,560
The Thousand Years Token.

132
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:13,680
Exactly.

133
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:16,520
The Thousand Years Token is sealed

134
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,280
beneath Mount Buzhou,

135
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,840
in the Abyss of Infinity,

136
00:15:20,080 --> 00:15:20,880
correct?

137
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:24,480
That Abyss of Infinity has been dormant for years,

138
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:27,960
yet recently showed signs of disturbance.

139
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:28,960
Perhaps

140
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:33,800
the thousand-year seal of the Thousand Years Token is weakening.

141
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:36,520
Shushan seeks to reseal the Thousand Years Token,

142
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:38,760
yet by coincidence,

143
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:44,000
Sword Sovereign Fengyue of Shushan is in closed-door cultivation.

144
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,680
Which means,

145
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,040
I've caught a

146
00:15:48,440 --> 00:15:50,600
once-in-a-millennium opportunity.

147
00:15:55,960 --> 00:15:56,840
I've waited

148
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,040
a long, long time

149
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,400
for this day.

150
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:05,600
Then what are we waiting for?

151
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:10,680
Left Guardian Minghuang.

152
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:12,800
Right Guardian Tuoshuo.

153
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,760
Star Lord Ji Xingluo of the Dark Soul Palace.

154
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:17,480
Four Grand Elders of the Seven Caves and Nine Netherworlds.

155
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:19,640
Greetings, Supreme Lord.

156
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:28,000
I shall establish a new Great Guardian

157
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:30,360
above the Left and Right Guardians

158
00:16:30,360 --> 00:16:33,000
and above the Star Lords of the Three Palaces

159
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:34,280
to assist me

160
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,640
in bringing glory to the Heavenly Demon Clan.

161
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,240
Chongguang,

162
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:41,360
come meet everyone.

163
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:01,360
Who is this person?

164
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:02,720
Where did he come from?

165
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:07,960
From today on,

166
00:17:08,119 --> 00:17:11,440
Chongguang is the Great Guardian of the Heavenly Demon Clan,

167
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,000
second only to me, the Demon Lord.

168
00:17:15,480 --> 00:17:16,920
All Star Lords and Elders,

169
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:20,079
you shall regard the Great Guardian as you would me.

170
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,040
Quickly greet the Great Guardian.

171
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:35,520
Why,

172
00:17:37,800 --> 00:17:38,960
do you not

173
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,800
understand what I'm saying?

174
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:55,480
Greetings, Great Guardian!

175
00:17:57,320 --> 00:18:00,040
Chongguang is a Fallen God of the Heavenly Realm.

176
00:18:00,800 --> 00:18:02,240
His arrival in our Heavenly Demon Clan

177
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,000
is fate's arrangement.

178
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,360
Our Heavenly Demon Clan has been oppressed by the Heavenly Realm

179
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:11,160
and forced to retreat to Mount Suyu for thousands of years.

180
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,320
Now,

181
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:15,600
with Guardian Chongguang's help,

182
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:18,440
we are like a tiger with wings.

183
00:18:18,760 --> 00:18:21,120
If we can seize the Thousand Years Token,

184
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,000
our Heavenly Demon Clan

185
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:26,200
shall surely rise again.

186
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:28,880
Supreme Lord,

187
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:31,600
the Thousand Years Token is guarded by the Immortal Sect

188
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:33,320
and sealed in the Abyss of Infinity.

189
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,320
To seize it

190
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:37,600
would mean open war with Shushan.

191
00:18:38,800 --> 00:18:40,720
Our demon army has not seen major battle in years.

192
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:42,720
To fight Shushan,

193
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:44,800
victory is uncertain.

194
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,840
Supreme Lord, you have ordered.

195
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:49,280
We dare not defy.

196
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:52,640
But the matter of seizing the Thousand Years Token is of great importance.

197
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,640
Please reconsider.

198
00:18:56,960 --> 00:18:59,680
It seems everyone has been at peace for too long.

199
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,200
Your fighting spirit and passion have been worn away.

200
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,800
If our demon army launches a surprise attack,

201
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:05,800
I suppose

202
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,880
Shushan will be caught off guard.

203
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:09,680
That's right,

204
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:16,320
we aim to strike with surprise.

205
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,000
Mount Suyu

206
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,920
has trapped us for over a thousand years.

207
00:19:22,160 --> 00:19:23,360
We will no longer

208
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,320
endure such days.

209
00:19:25,480 --> 00:19:26,280
Today,

210
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:31,280
as long as you follow me to Mount Buzhou,

211
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,360
seize the Thousand Years Token,

212
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:36,120
and help the Heavenly Demon Clan rise,

213
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:38,360
we shall unite the three realms.

214
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:55,280
The Demon Clan rises, unites the three realms!

215
00:19:55,680 --> 00:19:56,480
No!

216
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:03,000
Honey.

217
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:04,240
Supreme Lord.

218
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,320
You are with child.

219
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,760
Why are you not resting in the palace,

220
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,240
and came here instead?

221
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,520
You're going to Mount Buzhou?

222
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,000
Honey,

223
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,720
you are about to give birth.

224
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,480
You need not concern yourself with this matter.

225
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:17,320
Return to the palace and await me in peace.

226
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:19,320
When our son is born,

227
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,280
I want him to witness

228
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:23,960
the grand sight of our Heavenly Demon Clan

229
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,360
unifying the three realms.

230
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:28,880
When I return triumphant,

231
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:31,800
I shall give you and our son

232
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,880
a great gift.

233
00:20:35,240 --> 00:20:36,720
Supreme Lord! Supreme Lord!

234
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:42,200
The Heavenly Demon Clan shall rise!

235
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,760
Unite the three realms!

236
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,200
Fengyue,

237
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:17,880
I didn't expect you to leave seclusion early.

238
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,080
Yeyuan,

239
00:22:20,280 --> 00:22:22,520
the Thousand Years Token is sealed here by the Nine Heavens.

240
00:22:22,840 --> 00:22:23,680
Whoever takes it

241
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:25,440
will be an enemy of the Heavenly Realm,

242
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:26,960
and hunted by all three realms.

243
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:28,640
Aren't you afraid

244
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:29,920
you'll bring ruin to the Heavenly Demon Clan,

245
00:22:29,920 --> 00:22:31,400
leaving no place

246
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,520
to call home?

247
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,320
I rebel against the Nine Heavens and the three realms!

248
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,200
Seize the Token!

249
00:23:41,200 --> 00:23:42,120
I'll stop him.

250
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:43,800
You go seize the Thousand Years Token.

251
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,640
The Heavenly Demon Token...

252
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,120
Child,

253
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:55,440
remember this.

254
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,600
You are the son of the Demon Lord.

255
00:24:59,840 --> 00:25:01,040
You must

256
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:03,160
survive.

257
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:25,520
Supreme Lord.

258
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,960
Guard the Heavenly Demon Clan for me.

259
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,760
From this day on,

260
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:06,320
you will serve Chongguang as your Supreme Lord.

261
00:28:06,920 --> 00:28:07,920
-Supreme Lord.
-Supreme Lord.

262
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:12,840
One day...

263
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,400
Supreme Lord!

264
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:27,240
Let's go.

265
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,680
Little Taoist.

266
00:30:36,280 --> 00:30:37,080
Excuse me,

267
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:39,120
do you know the way up the mountain?

268
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:45,680
Little Taoist.

269
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:46,960
Excuse me,

270
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:48,680
do you know the way up the mountain?

271
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:35,840
Who are you?

272
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:41,680
So you can speak!

273
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,280
I was in midday lessons just now,

274
00:31:43,440 --> 00:31:44,400
I must not be interrupted.

275
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:46,480
So you used your sword to hurt me?

276
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:48,240
I just wanted to stop you from disturbing me.

277
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,160
Besides,

278
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,760
you attacked first.

279
00:31:50,760 --> 00:31:52,360
I only asked a question.

280
00:31:52,360 --> 00:31:53,440
I called out and you didn't respond.

281
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:55,920
So I tried to use my Phoenix Feather Chain to get your attention.

282
00:31:56,680 --> 00:31:58,320
I would've left after asking.

283
00:31:58,440 --> 00:31:59,760
Why get so serious about a small interruption?

284
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:01,640
No one else is here in the courtyard.

285
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,120
Why are you so serious?

286
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,680
My master said class ends at 3 p.m.

287
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,520
so I must end at 3 p.m.

288
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:09,440
Whether people are here or not is the same.

289
00:32:09,920 --> 00:32:11,360
So you're just a blockhead.

290
00:32:13,240 --> 00:32:14,360
Who are you,

291
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,320
and what do you want to ask?

292
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,080
You don't need to know who I am.

293
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:18,760
I just want to go up the mountain.

294
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:20,560
Do you know

295
00:32:20,920 --> 00:32:22,440
if there's a path leading up from here?

296
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,280
There's no path in Xuanqing Court.

297
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:26,000
Then how did you get up here?

298
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:27,280
I climbed.

299
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:29,680
Why are you going up the mountain?

300
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,840
My father has been fighting someone atop the Snow Peak

301
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:36,880
for three days and nights.

302
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,400
I'm worried

303
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,640
and want to check on him.

304
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:40,760
My master also said

305
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:42,720
he's fighting atop the Snow Peak.

306
00:32:44,280 --> 00:32:45,600
He is fighting your father?

307
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:54,120
The one fighting my father

308
00:32:54,440 --> 00:32:55,440
is your master?

309
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:07,600
Master Feng, you also once trained in the Immortal Sect.

310
00:33:07,680 --> 00:33:08,680
You should know

311
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,200
the Thousand Years Token concerns the safety of the three realms.

312
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,760
It is no ordinary artifact.

313
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:13,760
Even if you

314
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,240
defeat me today,

315
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,600
countless disciples of Shushan

316
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,680
will risk their lives to guard the Thousand Years Token.

317
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,000
Fengyue,

318
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:25,000
we once trained together under our master.

319
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,800
My talent clearly surpassed yours,

320
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:29,520
yet the Fengyue Sword Style was passed to you,

321
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:32,440
and I was told to assist you in guarding the Thousand Years Token.

322
00:33:33,120 --> 00:33:34,040
Now,

323
00:33:34,280 --> 00:33:35,920
my divine power is complete.

324
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,600
Though our master has long passed,

325
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,680
I believe his spirit in the heavens

326
00:33:40,680 --> 00:33:41,800
will see

327
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,240
how grave a mistake

328
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,840
his choice was.

329
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:49,080
Back then you were swayed by mortal emotions,

330
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,520
breaking your cultivation path,

331
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:53,160
and even betrayed the sect.

332
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:54,400
Master

333
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:57,360
was disappointed in you, so he passed the teachings to me.

334
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,000
I didn't expect

335
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,240
that you harbored resentment,

336
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,320
and hid your wicked intentions.

337
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,680
And now you blame Master for injustice?

338
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:04,680
If the Thousand Years Token falls into your hands,

339
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,280
the world will surely suffer.

340
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:06,920
Very well,

341
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:10,239
then let this be a battle to the death between us.

342
00:34:31,199 --> 00:34:32,000
Since

343
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:35,199
your master is fighting my father,

344
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,239
why not

345
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:37,920
go up the mountain together and watch the fight?

346
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,800
No.

347
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:41,040
My master instructed me

348
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,440
to stay in the court until he returns.

349
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:45,159
Such a blockhead.

350
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:46,280
So obedient.

351
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:48,440
Let me ask you,

352
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,120
if you made a mistake,

353
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,840
would your master severely punish you?

354
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:56,280
He wouldn't punish you, so what are you afraid of?

355
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,440
It's not that he wouldn't punish me,

356
00:34:58,480 --> 00:34:59,680
it's that I've never made a mistake.

357
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,600
What a pitiful soul.

358
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,160
There is sun and moon above, right and wrong below.

359
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:09,120
If you've never made a mistake,

360
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,520
you only understand

361
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:12,040
half of life's truth.

362
00:35:12,520 --> 00:35:14,320
Even if you sit here until you're old,

363
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:16,280
you will never attain the Way, blockhead.

364
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:19,640
Forget it.

365
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:20,720
Wait here then.

366
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,720
I'll go myself.

367
00:35:23,360 --> 00:35:24,240
There's no path up the mountain.

368
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,240
How will you go?

369
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:26,320
I'll climb.

370
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:27,680
It's too dangerous.

371
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:28,600
None of your business.

372
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:43,960
I have divined

373
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:45,600
that you face a deadly fate soon.

374
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:47,000
After I leave,

375
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,120
you must remember

376
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,640
to remain within the court,

377
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:51,080
practice three times daily, six sessions in total,

378
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,280
meditate and seek the Way.

379
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,600
You must not step outside the court gate.

380
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,360
If so,

381
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,600
you might survive this fate.

382
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:18,760
Quick, give me your hand!

383
00:37:19,600 --> 00:37:20,400
Here!

384
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:23,560
Quick!

385
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,040
Your hand...

386
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:30,240
Get out of the way!

387
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:32,480
You can't save me.

388
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:43,920
Let go!

389
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,720
If I let go, you'll die!

390
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,880
If you don't let go, you'll die too!

391
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:49,800
I won't.

392
00:37:49,920 --> 00:37:50,880
I'll save you!

393
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:54,720
Hold on!

394
00:38:15,680 --> 00:38:18,680
You just grabbed my hand.

395
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,360
If I didn't, you'd die.

396
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,000
Then...

397
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:23,760
Are you okay?

398
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:25,120
I'm fine.

399
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:26,080
You don't have to worry.

400
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:29,160
You… you're not cold?

401
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:30,760
Cold?

402
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:33,560
With the blazing sun overhead,

403
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:34,880
why would I be cold?

404
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,400
Strange…

405
00:38:43,360 --> 00:38:44,600
Do I seem strange?

406
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,120
Ice silkworm cocoon.

407
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:58,240
You know it?

408
00:38:59,440 --> 00:39:00,960
I read about it in medical books.

409
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:02,560
White jade ice silkworms,

410
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,720
their cocoons are extremely cold.

411
00:39:04,080 --> 00:39:05,120
They don't get wet in water,

412
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,120
and don't burn in fire.

413
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:09,080
How does such a treasure end up on you?

414
00:39:10,160 --> 00:39:12,520
I was born with a strange coldness.

415
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,440
No one could get close to me.

416
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:16,400
Father got this ice silkworm cocoon

417
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,400
from a miracle doctor

418
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:20,640
named Shi Bujiu to protect me.

419
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,760
But

420
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,480
even with this cocoon,

421
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:26,840
though it allows me to approach things,

422
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:28,120
when

423
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,520
ordinary people with flesh get close to me,

424
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,400
they still shiver from the cold.

425
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:34,360
But why aren't you afraid?

426
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:37,240
I don't know.

427
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,080
But I don't feel cold at all.

428
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,200
Can I hold your hand again?

429
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,720
Amazing.

430
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,400
You're the first person in this world

431
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,440
who isn't afraid of the coldness from my body.

432
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,400
Can you be my best friend?

433
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:12,360
You're the only one in this world who's not afraid of me.

434
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,400
You can be my one and only best friend.

435
00:40:17,600 --> 00:40:18,960
What's a best friend?

436
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,520
My father said,

437
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,640
a best friend is someone who lives and dies together with you.

438
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,800
I won't let you die.

439
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:25,920
I'll protect you.

440
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,520
So you agree?

441
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:29,880
You even show compassion for a baby bird.

442
00:40:30,120 --> 00:40:31,080
My master says

443
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:32,200
the ones we should protect

444
00:40:32,200 --> 00:40:34,000
are kind-hearted people who show compassion.

445
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:34,760
That's not it.

446
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:37,840
It's because I'm your best friend.

447
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:41,120
Then how will you protect me?

448
00:40:41,720 --> 00:40:42,760
I'll take you up the mountain.

449
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,640
Aren't you afraid of breaking the rules?

450
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:45,680
To me,

451
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:47,720
watching you risk your life would be the real mistake.

452
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,880
If I believe something is right, I'll do it.

453
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:50,880
Little Taoist,

454
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,640
you look silly,

455
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,000
but your mind is pretty sharp.

456
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,520
My name is Moxiao.

457
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,800
I'm not just some little taoist.

458
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,080
I'm Feng Lixue.

459
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:02,960
Then, Moxiao,

460
00:41:03,400 --> 00:41:05,120
how exactly will you take me up the mountain?
