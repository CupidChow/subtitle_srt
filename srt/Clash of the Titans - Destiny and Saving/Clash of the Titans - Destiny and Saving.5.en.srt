00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,759
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,630
(Episode 5)

3
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:43,000
You're awake now.

4
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:48,050
You can't speak?

5
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:52,400
So,

6
00:01:52,810 --> 00:01:54,410
you're like Snowy,

7
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:56,280
but not quite like me.

8
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,200
I'm just practicing the Small and Great Circulation,

9
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,770
so I can't speak at the moment.

10
00:02:02,050 --> 00:02:04,850
It seems like your injury still hasn't healed properly.

11
00:02:04,940 --> 00:02:06,660
Here, have some more Lingzhi.

12
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,910
What's wrong?

13
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:18,400
You want some wild fruits?

14
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:22,990
I think

15
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:24,490
it might be easier

16
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:26,200
if you tell me in a way

17
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:27,680
that I can understand.

18
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:29,560
Otherwise,

19
00:02:29,710 --> 00:02:31,000
blink once

20
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,770
if you want Lingzhi,

21
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,630
and twice

22
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,840
if you want wild fruits.

23
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,880
You want Lingzhi, right?

24
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:43,200
I'll get it for you.

25
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,880
I can tell you're happy.

26
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:54,360
Here you go.

27
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,079
Snowy,

28
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:51,040
stay close.

29
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,040
Alright,

30
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,610
I know you're hungry,

31
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,960
but we're out of fruit.

32
00:04:20,410 --> 00:04:21,959
I'll find you something else to eat.

33
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:26,760
As for yours,

34
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:27,760
it's a snow peach.

35
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,100
Very sweet.

36
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:31,840
Mine

37
00:04:32,159 --> 00:04:33,380
is a red plum.

38
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,760
A bit sour.

39
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:38,640
But that's clearly just snow.

40
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:41,560
You're awake.

41
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:43,730
You can move.

42
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,310
You can talk.

43
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:47,570
So, you're just like me,

44
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,159
not like Snowy.

45
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,020
Do you live like this every day?

46
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:54,450
These fruits aren't enough to fill your stomach.

47
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:59,350
I know,

48
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:02,610
but Snowy is really hungry.

49
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:05,470
Our wild fruits are all eaten up.

50
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,320
I've got to cheer it up somehow.

51
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:12,600
Miss, thank you for saving my life.

52
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:13,460
How about

53
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,170
I go find something for you to eat?

54
00:05:15,190 --> 00:05:16,250
That's not wise.

55
00:05:16,640 --> 00:05:17,920
There are snow wolves roaming nearby.

56
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,880
If you get injured

57
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,360
while fighting them,

58
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:23,960
you'll need more wild fruits and Lingzhi.

59
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:26,930
We don't have any left here.

60
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:29,810
In our world,

61
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:30,750
getting food

62
00:05:30,930 --> 00:05:32,490
doesn't always mean fighting.

63
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,040
Snowy,

64
00:05:55,470 --> 00:05:56,440
why don't we

65
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:58,400
just go pick some wild fruits?

66
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,880
I doubt he'll be back today anyway.

67
00:06:03,710 --> 00:06:06,680
And without having to split it into three portions,

68
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:08,880
we should have plenty to eat.

69
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:09,860
Let's go.

70
00:06:10,410 --> 00:06:11,470
I'm back.

71
00:06:19,870 --> 00:06:21,140
You're back.

72
00:06:27,850 --> 00:06:29,240
What's this?

73
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:30,680
The eatery at the foot of the mountain

74
00:06:30,710 --> 00:06:31,870
only opens at dawn,

75
00:06:32,150 --> 00:06:33,240
so I had to wait for a while.

76
00:06:33,390 --> 00:06:34,420
Eat it while it's still hot.

77
00:06:35,900 --> 00:06:38,490
This is what the people at the foot of the mountain eat?

78
00:06:38,730 --> 00:06:39,370
Yes.

79
00:06:39,810 --> 00:06:41,650
I figured that snowballs and wild grass

80
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:42,990
wouldn't be enough to fill us up,

81
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:43,930
so

82
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,920
I bought some glutinous rice balls from the eatery.

83
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:46,940
When you're hungry,

84
00:06:47,150 --> 00:06:48,150
you should eat this.

85
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:51,450
Let's go, Snowy.

86
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:53,070
We've got wild fruits to eat.

87
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:54,270
If you don't want it,

88
00:06:54,290 --> 00:06:56,340
I'll have to toss it to the snow wolves.

89
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:57,690
That'd be a waste.

90
00:06:57,780 --> 00:06:59,700
But if the snow wolves find out

91
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,100
we've got food like the kind people at the foot of the mountain eat,

92
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,920
they'll come for us.

93
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,640
That's true.

94
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:13,000
Then let's just say

95
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,600
you traded these

96
00:07:14,630 --> 00:07:16,390
for my wild fruits.

97
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,610
Alright.

98
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:18,720
Eat it while it's hot.

99
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,940
It won't taste as good if it's cold.

100
00:07:28,420 --> 00:07:29,970
Your injury isn't fully healed yet.

101
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:30,790
Do you want to

102
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,940
trade some more of this

103
00:07:31,970 --> 00:07:33,490
for my wild fruits?

104
00:07:34,159 --> 00:07:34,800
No, thanks.

105
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:36,659
I still need to hurry back to report to my master,

106
00:07:37,159 --> 00:07:38,190
so I'll take my leave now.

107
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,590
Wait a minute.

108
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:44,010
Once you're gone,

109
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,490
I won't get to eat these glutinous rice balls again.

110
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:48,400
If you want more,

111
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,480
you can find them at the foot of the mountain.

112
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,440
Miss,

113
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,060
if I may speak frankly,

114
00:07:55,090 --> 00:07:56,770
Snowy Mountain isn't an ideal place to live.

115
00:07:56,930 --> 00:07:59,010
Why don't you go down the mountain, find a village,

116
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,080
and live among the villagers?

117
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:01,420
That way, you'd have their mutual support,

118
00:08:01,450 --> 00:08:03,930
and your daily life would be much more comfortable.

119
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,760
I can't go down the mountain.

120
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:06,520
Why?

121
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,690
I am different from ordinary people.

122
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,850
Since you are so determined,

123
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,160
I won't press any further.

124
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:15,860
But if you ever change your mind

125
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:16,890
and decide to come down the mountain,

126
00:08:16,910 --> 00:08:18,710
you can always come to Shushan and find me.

127
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:19,580
Just mention my name,

128
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:20,320
Mo Xiao,

129
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,840
and I'll do my best to help you.

130
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:23,470
Mo Xiao.

131
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:25,560
May I ask for your honorable name?

132
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:27,260
Honorable name?

133
00:08:28,060 --> 00:08:29,180
By "honorable name,"

134
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,370
I mean your name.

135
00:08:32,309 --> 00:08:33,110
Wu Chen.

136
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,250
Snowy.

137
00:08:36,460 --> 00:08:37,340
Miss Wu Chen,

138
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:38,559
I'll take my leave now.

139
00:08:38,580 --> 00:08:40,049
We will meet again one day.

140
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,020
I've already had the glutinous rice balls,

141
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:56,790
so the Lingzhi and wild fruits

142
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,390
won't taste as good.

143
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,210
Miss Wu Chen?

144
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,490
Miss Wu Chen.

145
00:12:14,860 --> 00:12:15,880
Miss Wu Chen.

146
00:12:18,020 --> 00:12:19,040
Are you alright?

147
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,400
I still want to have

148
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:24,480
the glutinous rice balls.

149
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:27,920
Alright.

150
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:50,560
Supreme Lord,

151
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,130
Mo Xiao has taken care of the snow demon.

152
00:13:00,310 --> 00:13:01,990
I had it confined for 10 years.

153
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,680
Now that it's been freed,

154
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,340
it will surely cause chaos.

155
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:07,540
If it's been dealt with,

156
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,910
it's its own doing.

157
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,690
What about Wu Chen?

158
00:13:14,710 --> 00:13:16,630
Mo Xiao took her down the mountain.

159
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,830
That smoothly?

160
00:13:20,730 --> 00:13:23,040
Since Wu Chen has left,

161
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,110
there's no need

162
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,570
to keep the snow fox in the snow cave.

163
00:13:27,170 --> 00:13:30,340
After the Shushan Sect eliminates the demons, they will check again.

164
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:34,290
I only sealed its demonic aura with a demon-sealing elixir.

165
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:35,470
If it stays there any longer,

166
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,150
it'll reveal its true nature.

167
00:13:37,180 --> 00:13:38,820
Should I eliminate it then?

168
00:13:39,090 --> 00:13:39,530
No,

169
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,110
keep it.

170
00:13:42,630 --> 00:13:43,670
I have a use for it.

171
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,400
Why does she have

172
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,000
such strong cold energy inside her?

173
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,690
If it were anyone else,

174
00:14:05,960 --> 00:14:07,720
their body wouldn't survive

175
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:08,840
the extreme cold.

176
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:11,110
But she's lived alone in the ice plains all this time.

177
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,320
Who exactly is she?

178
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:30,450
You're not afraid of me.

179
00:14:31,160 --> 00:14:34,030
Why aren't you scared of the cold energy I carry?

180
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,750
You're the first person in this world

181
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,590
who can get close to me.

182
00:14:40,030 --> 00:14:42,400
I was born with a body of extreme cold.

183
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:44,450
No one can get near me.

184
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,340
It's so strange.

185
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:51,840
You're the first person

186
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:53,760
who isn't afraid of the cold I radiate.

187
00:14:54,850 --> 00:14:55,990
Miss Wu Chen,

188
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,000
do you know the source of the cold energy within you?

189
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:01,680
I don't know.

190
00:15:02,290 --> 00:15:04,520
I don't understand why I have

191
00:15:04,550 --> 00:15:06,110
this cold energy,

192
00:15:06,410 --> 00:15:09,090
nor do I know how to get rid of it.

193
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,590
I can't control it.

194
00:15:12,910 --> 00:15:15,940
That's why I live alone on the Snowy Mountain.

195
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:17,680
What?

196
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,190
Do you also despise this cold energy?

197
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:22,880
No.

198
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,950
The extreme cold energy.

199
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:38,800
Why does she possess the same strange coldness inside her as Lixue?

200
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,880
Could it be...

201
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,120
No.

202
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,480
It's impossible.

203
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,660
Lixue is already dead.

204
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:48,320
I saw her die

205
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:49,600
with my own eyes.

206
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,640
Immortal Lord.

207
00:15:54,760 --> 00:15:55,680
Immortal Lord.

208
00:15:55,910 --> 00:15:58,260
Immortal Lord, you've helped us rid ourselves of the demon.

209
00:15:58,400 --> 00:15:59,640
You are truly virtuous.

210
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,600
It's my pleasure, sir.

211
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:01,520
Exterminating demons and monsters

212
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,600
is the duty of the disciples of Shushan.

213
00:16:05,370 --> 00:16:06,340
But

214
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:09,010
as for the girl you brought back...

215
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,920
Wu Chen

216
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,720
is an orphan I found on the Snowy Mountain.

217
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:12,960
I brought her to the village

218
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:14,120
to tend to her injuries.

219
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:15,830
Alright then.

220
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:17,520
What's wrong, sir?

221
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,120
It's just that

222
00:16:19,300 --> 00:16:20,700
the Mang Mountain wasteland

223
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,000
is a frozen, desolate place with no one around.

224
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,220
-Could it be the girl...
-Bad news!

225
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:26,280
Bad news!

226
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:27,690
That girl...

227
00:16:27,710 --> 00:16:29,470
Immortal Lord, please go take a look!

228
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,000
Warm.

229
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:35,460
Aren't you afraid of me?

230
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:41,320
(Calm the Mind)

231
00:16:42,390 --> 00:16:43,480
Warm.

232
00:16:43,770 --> 00:16:44,930
Aren't you afraid of me?

233
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,700
I'm not afraid of you either.

234
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:57,370
Aren't you cold?

235
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,950
Not cold.

236
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:00,160
Not cold at all.

237
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,040
It feels so good.

238
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,040
Are you afraid of me?

239
00:17:04,670 --> 00:17:05,310
Immortal Lord,

240
00:17:05,849 --> 00:17:06,440
it's a misunderstanding.

241
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:06,880
(Calm the Mind)

242
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:07,520
It's a misunderstanding.
(Calm the Mind)

243
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:15,280
They're just like you.

244
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,440
They're warm.

245
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,319
Miss Wu Chen,

246
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:18,760
you need to learn to protect yourself.

247
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:20,250
Men and women should keep their distance.

248
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:23,990
What does "Men and women should keep their distance" mean?

249
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:27,000
I'll explain it to you slowly in the future.

250
00:17:28,700 --> 00:17:30,140
Look at the two of them.

251
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,310
Come with me.

252
00:17:42,020 --> 00:17:43,240
Does this look good?

253
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:44,080
It looks great.

254
00:17:46,690 --> 00:17:48,160
Miss, look at this windmill.

255
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:49,240
It's so much fun.

256
00:17:52,680 --> 00:17:53,480
Look.

257
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:55,880
Miss,

258
00:17:56,050 --> 00:17:57,760
you haven't paid yet.

259
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,360
Paid for what?

260
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,840
Are you joking?

261
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:02,720
Paid for what?

262
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,960
You need to pay for your things with money.

263
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:06,180
Money?

264
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:07,400
What's that?

265
00:18:07,430 --> 00:18:08,560
Can it play with me?

266
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,600
Hey, you.

267
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:11,700
Are you looking for trouble?

268
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:12,750
Boss.

269
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:16,680
Sir,

270
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:17,560
well...

271
00:18:18,040 --> 00:18:19,800
Can she take

272
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:21,000
whatever she wants now?

273
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,880
Sure.

274
00:18:21,920 --> 00:18:23,120
Take whatever you like.

275
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,870
Thank you, boss.

276
00:18:33,490 --> 00:18:35,650
What did you give them?

277
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,660
That made them give me this.

278
00:18:37,690 --> 00:18:38,570
Remember,

279
00:18:38,590 --> 00:18:39,470
the first rule is that

280
00:18:39,500 --> 00:18:41,210
if you want something,

281
00:18:41,230 --> 00:18:42,910
you must trade it for something of equal value.

282
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,900
What's considered equal value?

283
00:18:49,030 --> 00:18:49,910
It's this.

284
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,040
This?

285
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:53,120
I believe these items

286
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:54,040
should be enough for you

287
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:55,320
to trade for basic necessities.

288
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,880
So, I can trade these

289
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,440
for whatever I want?

290
00:18:58,440 --> 00:18:59,000
Exactly.

291
00:19:05,380 --> 00:19:06,570
This is for you.

292
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:07,570
This is for me.

293
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:10,960
Boss,

294
00:19:12,210 --> 00:19:13,000
this is for you.

295
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,520
Thank you, boss.

296
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:23,640
Boss,

297
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,440
this is for you.

298
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,500
Is it fun?

299
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:33,840
Boss.

300
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:37,560
The things Xie Lingyun gave us

301
00:19:37,560 --> 00:19:38,680
are really useful.

302
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,220
We've already walked down this street twice.

303
00:19:44,250 --> 00:19:45,770
Where to next?

304
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,570
Let's go up ahead and take a look.

305
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:49,240
Alright.

306
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,870
(Maoyuan Silk and Satin)

307
00:19:55,880 --> 00:19:56,680
Follow me.

308
00:19:58,660 --> 00:19:59,020
What's this place for?

309
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,180
(Maoyuan Silk and Satin)
What's this place for?

310
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,370
(Maoyuan Silk and Satin)

311
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,650
Are we going to change clothes?

312
00:20:07,670 --> 00:20:08,270
That's right.

313
00:20:08,360 --> 00:20:09,520
Let's see if there's anything you like.

314
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,720
Sir, are you here to buy clothes?

315
00:20:16,910 --> 00:20:17,470
Yes.

316
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,060
Please pack this one for her.

317
00:20:20,090 --> 00:20:20,890
Alright.

318
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:22,690
Miss, please try it on first.

319
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,110
Give this to me.

320
00:20:27,190 --> 00:20:28,140
Hold on!

321
00:20:59,080 --> 00:20:59,880
All done?

322
00:21:02,040 --> 00:21:02,840
Done.

323
00:21:16,170 --> 00:21:17,320
So simple.

324
00:21:18,980 --> 00:21:20,270
From now on,

325
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,450
you should help me with this.

326
00:21:22,930 --> 00:21:23,850
The second rule:

327
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:25,540
When changing clothes, you must make sure you're not seen

328
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:27,240
and never undress in public.

329
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:28,710
I even have to avoid you seeing me?

330
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,670
Of course.

331
00:21:31,580 --> 00:21:32,060
It's not "even,"

332
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,100
it's especially.

333
00:21:39,650 --> 00:21:41,640
Can I trade for

334
00:21:41,670 --> 00:21:43,620
the glutinous rice balls now?

335
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:48,140
(Glutinous Rice Balls)

336
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,510
Is it fun?
(Glutinous Rice Balls)

337
00:21:49,510 --> 00:21:49,530
(Glutinous Rice Balls)

338
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:50,450
It's fun!
(Glutinous Rice Balls)

339
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,840
(Glutinous Rice Balls)

340
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,920
Here come the rice balls!
(Glutinous Rice Balls)

341
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,420
(Glutinous Rice Balls)

342
00:21:56,720 --> 00:21:57,520
Hold on.

343
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:05,840
The third rule: Use bamboo chopsticks for meals

344
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,620
and a soup spoon

345
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,940
for porridge or soup.

346
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,960
The fourth rule:

347
00:22:39,990 --> 00:22:40,550
You...

348
00:22:40,570 --> 00:22:41,470
Be good.

349
00:22:49,150 --> 00:22:52,850
(Glutinous Rice Balls)

350
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm already using the chopsticks.

351
00:23:06,490 --> 00:23:07,820
Rule number four:

352
00:23:07,900 --> 00:23:09,640
You can't just touch my head like that.

353
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:13,320
Rule number five:

354
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:16,320
No arguing or making noise on the street.

355
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:17,220
Rule number six:

356
00:23:17,260 --> 00:23:19,220
Don't look around while walking.

357
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,200
Rule number seven:

358
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,440
Don't make physical contact with others casually,

359
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:24,040
especially not touching other people's heads.

360
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:30,850
What are you doing?

361
00:23:30,870 --> 00:23:32,630
I didn't touch you.

362
00:23:33,220 --> 00:23:33,900
Let go.

363
00:23:35,380 --> 00:23:36,430
Let go.

364
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:37,690
Let go.

365
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:42,760
The seventh rule:

366
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,120
You also cannot

367
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:45,600
casually touch other people's belongings.

368
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:47,720
As a young lady,

369
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,440
you need to be mindful of rules and etiquette.

370
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:58,800
The twenty-eighth rule:

371
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:00,520
When walking on the street,

372
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,400
don't stare at others randomly.

373
00:24:04,450 --> 00:24:05,760
And the twenty-ninth rule:

374
00:24:06,480 --> 00:24:08,000
Twenty-ninth...

375
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,240
The twenty-ninth rule:

376
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:14,720
When someone is speaking to you,

377
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:16,480
you should listen carefully and attentively.

378
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:18,280
This is basic courtesy and respect for others...

379
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,510
You're hurt.

380
00:24:26,070 --> 00:24:26,990
What happened?

381
00:24:39,400 --> 00:24:41,680
The thirtieth rule is the most important.

382
00:24:41,680 --> 00:24:42,660
Listen carefully.

383
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:45,260
From now on, don't casually...

384
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:49,360
Don't casually

385
00:24:50,650 --> 00:24:52,770
lick other people's wounds.

386
00:24:53,130 --> 00:24:55,210
Back when I was on Snowy Mountain,

387
00:24:55,280 --> 00:24:57,420
I was the one who set the rules for Snowy.

388
00:24:57,520 --> 00:24:59,720
I let you off for so long

389
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,240
because you had tasty glutinous rice balls.

390
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:02,000
But now,

391
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,280
I'm going to set a rule for you.

392
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:06,880
What is it?

393
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,850
This rule is:

394
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,650
Don't set rules for me.

395
00:25:14,750 --> 00:25:16,150
This isn't Mang Mountain,

396
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,080
and it's not the Snowy Mountain you're familiar with.

397
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:20,280
You need to follow these rules

398
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:22,880
if you want to live peacefully with the villagers.

399
00:25:22,910 --> 00:25:24,570
I'm doing all this for your own good.

400
00:25:25,720 --> 00:25:29,440
You want me to live with the villagers?

401
00:25:43,080 --> 00:25:44,040
Hua,

402
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:45,860
what's this?

403
00:25:46,480 --> 00:25:47,840
That's a dressing box.

404
00:25:47,860 --> 00:25:49,480
What's a dressing box?

405
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:52,040
Hasn't your mother ever done your hair for you?

406
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:53,960
I don't have a mother.

407
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,040
You don't have a mother?

408
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:02,280
That's really pitiful.

409
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:04,560
Not pitiful.

410
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,540
A child without a mother,

411
00:26:07,570 --> 00:26:08,930
how could that not be pitiful?

412
00:26:10,070 --> 00:26:11,200
No mother,

413
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,160
that's not pitiful.

414
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:13,930
No glutinous rice balls,

415
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,790
now that's pitiful.

416
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:16,610
How did you manage your days

417
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,000
on Mang Mountain?

418
00:26:19,400 --> 00:26:20,320
There was no one to care for you,

419
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,040
no one to teach you.

420
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:23,720
Come on,

421
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:24,840
let's sit down.

422
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:28,840
Wu Chen,

423
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:29,800
you're really beautiful.

424
00:26:29,900 --> 00:26:31,360
What does "beautiful" mean?

425
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,560
Is it a good thing or a bad thing?

426
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,080
Of course, it's good.

427
00:26:37,290 --> 00:26:39,360
Immortal Lord, are you leaving?

428
00:26:39,660 --> 00:26:41,000
I've delayed for several days.

429
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:42,870
Now that Miss Wu Chen is no longer in critical condition,

430
00:26:42,890 --> 00:26:44,250
I should return to make a report.

431
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:47,680
Miss Wu Chen has lived on Mang Mountain for a long time,

432
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,200
and now she's recovering here in the village.

433
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,100
Please take good care of her, sir.

434
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,400
I will follow your instructions

435
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:54,920
and ensure her well-being to the best of my ability.

436
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:57,700
I'll have my daughter-in-law befriend her,

437
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:59,360
teach her at home,

438
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,240
and have her help with some household chores.

439
00:27:01,280 --> 00:27:03,360
Of course, she will have enough to eat.

440
00:27:03,380 --> 00:27:04,550
Rest assured.

441
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,040
This is the best arrangement.

442
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,440
Let me thank you on Miss Wu Chen's behalf.

443
00:27:10,810 --> 00:27:13,120
I won't trouble you any further.

444
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,440
Farewell.

445
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,400
Immortal Lord, you have important matters to attend to,

446
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,780
so I won't take up more of your time.

447
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:18,850
Please.

448
00:27:32,040 --> 00:27:32,920
Miss Wu Chen.

449
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:38,280
What are you still standing there for?

450
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,640
Come here quickly.

451
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:42,800
Miss Wu Chen,

452
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:44,280
your body is fine now.

453
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:47,040
The coldness within you can't be resolved quickly,

454
00:27:47,080 --> 00:27:49,120
and I need to hurry back to Shushan to make a report.

455
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,390
So, I've temporarily entrusted you to the Elder's family.

456
00:27:51,420 --> 00:27:52,500
When I return,

457
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,720
I'll figure out how to help you with this coldness.

458
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:05,400
Am I beautiful?

459
00:28:10,940 --> 00:28:12,330
What are you doing?

460
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:25,150
How about this?

461
00:28:25,690 --> 00:28:26,920
Am I beautiful?

462
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,340
Miss Wu Chen,

463
00:28:39,370 --> 00:28:41,330
who taught you all this?

464
00:28:42,450 --> 00:28:43,770
What do you mean?

465
00:28:43,840 --> 00:28:47,180
Why doesn't my spell work on you?

466
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,370
What spell?

467
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:50,710
Hua,

468
00:28:50,740 --> 00:28:52,940
why doesn't the spell you taught me

469
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:54,980
work on him?

470
00:28:55,010 --> 00:28:56,350
What spell?

471
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,260
This one.

472
00:28:58,280 --> 00:29:01,060
When women possess beauty,

473
00:29:01,420 --> 00:29:04,800
they wield the most powerful spell.

474
00:29:05,010 --> 00:29:06,410
What spell?

475
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:10,880
It's the spell that makes a man unable to leave you.

476
00:29:11,970 --> 00:29:14,730
How do you use this spell?

477
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,160
Miss Wu Chen.

478
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:17,920
That's...

479
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:20,460
That's a secret whispered among us.

480
00:29:20,490 --> 00:29:21,200
How could you

481
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:23,740
tell the Immortal Lord about it?

482
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,680
Hua,

483
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:29,230
Miss Wu Chen grew up on Mang Mountain

484
00:29:29,260 --> 00:29:30,220
and is inexperienced with the ways of the world.

485
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,080
Some things

486
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:33,570
still need to be taught properly.

487
00:29:33,690 --> 00:29:35,590
You're right, Immortal Lord.

488
00:29:35,730 --> 00:29:37,640
I'll keep that in mind.

489
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:38,400
By the way,

490
00:29:38,400 --> 00:29:39,350
Hua,

491
00:29:39,380 --> 00:29:41,060
I brought some glutinous rice balls over,

492
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:42,160
and I'm warming them up on the stove.

493
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,630
Please take them to Miss Wu Chen.

494
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:44,940
There are glutinous rice balls?

495
00:29:45,010 --> 00:29:45,810
I'll go.

496
00:29:47,680 --> 00:29:48,560
Hua,

497
00:29:48,580 --> 00:29:50,650
my spell really works.

498
00:29:50,670 --> 00:29:53,470
The glutinous rice balls are the best proof of that.

499
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:55,120
Miss Wu Chen,

500
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:56,000
don't touch it.

501
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,080
It might burn you.

502
00:29:59,200 --> 00:30:00,640
I won't say goodbye to you then.

503
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,180
Take care.

504
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:02,220
(Harmony and Prosperity)
Take care.

505
00:30:02,220 --> 00:30:05,360
(Harmony and Prosperity)

506
00:30:31,550 --> 00:30:32,390
Where is Mo Xiao?

507
00:30:32,410 --> 00:30:33,770
Where did he go?

508
00:30:33,880 --> 00:30:34,640
What's happening?

509
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,680
What are you going to do?

510
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:36,800
Where did Mo Xiao go?

511
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:38,120
You've hidden him, haven't you?

512
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,720
The Immortal Lord has returned to Shushan.

513
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:41,360
Stop causing trouble here.

514
00:30:41,360 --> 00:30:42,360
He's gone?

515
00:30:42,380 --> 00:30:44,080
He wouldn't leave me behind.

516
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:44,840
You're lying.

517
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:45,920
I'm going to find him.

518
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:46,880
Wu Chen.

519
00:30:47,830 --> 00:30:49,870
What a shameless woman.

520
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:50,720
Hua,

521
00:30:50,740 --> 00:30:51,870
take her back to the room.

522
00:30:51,890 --> 00:30:53,190
Wu Chen,

523
00:30:53,210 --> 00:30:54,740
just come back with me.

524
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:55,570
Hua,

525
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:56,950
don't touch me or push me.

526
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:58,620
If you do, I'll hurt you.

527
00:30:58,960 --> 00:31:00,960
You two, hold her down.

528
00:31:01,340 --> 00:31:02,560
-Take her back to the room.
-Don't push me.

529
00:31:02,560 --> 00:31:03,080
Hurry up.

530
00:31:03,080 --> 00:31:03,800
-Take her back to the room.
-Don't push me.

531
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:05,700
You'll hurt yourself.

532
00:31:06,400 --> 00:31:07,280
Let go of me.

533
00:31:07,650 --> 00:31:08,970
Don't push me.

534
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:09,840
Behave yourself.

535
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:11,230
Hua,

536
00:31:11,280 --> 00:31:12,280
don't push me.

537
00:31:12,280 --> 00:31:13,790
Wu Chen,

538
00:31:13,810 --> 00:31:16,050
the Immortal Lord is a disciple of an immortal sect,

539
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:17,590
devoted to his cultivation.

540
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:19,410
You, on the other hand, are just an ordinary woman,

541
00:31:19,430 --> 00:31:21,370
and thus cannot be with him.

542
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:23,620
He has entrusted you to my family's care.

543
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:24,600
Rest assured,

544
00:31:24,640 --> 00:31:26,880
we will treat you well.

545
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,610
What's this talk of immortal sects and the ordinary world?

546
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,360
He gave me glutinous rice balls,

547
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:31,460
and took me down the mountain.

548
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,800
All I want is to be with him.

549
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:35,020
Wu Chen,

550
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,040
I understand your feelings,

551
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:40,830
but he's a sword immortal from Shushan.

552
00:31:41,130 --> 00:31:43,480
He will never have feelings for you.

553
00:31:43,640 --> 00:31:45,770
You need to let go of this idea.

554
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:48,120
Let me say it once again.

555
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:49,720
Let go of me.

556
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,180
Stay at my place

557
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:53,350
for two years,

558
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,840
and I'll help you find a good family to marry into.

559
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,380
Then you can have one or two children.

560
00:31:58,560 --> 00:32:00,640
Isn't that a good life?

561
00:32:01,530 --> 00:32:02,830
Are you going to

562
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:05,310
let me go or not?

563
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:08,840
Wu Chen,

564
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,200
just listen to me.

565
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:13,770
I'm doing this for your own good.

566
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:46,400
Hurry up!

567
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:09,920
Come on.

568
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,760
You should eat too.

569
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:24,730
-Oh no! Demon!
-Demon!

570
00:33:29,070 --> 00:33:30,210
What's going on?

571
00:33:35,190 --> 00:33:36,270
Miss Wu Chen.

572
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:37,350
Wu Chen.

573
00:34:15,679 --> 00:34:18,320
I knew you wouldn't leave.

574
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:22,840
I have a spell.

575
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:39,880
It's my fault for setting so many rules

576
00:34:40,550 --> 00:34:42,040
and overlooking this one.

577
00:34:59,080 --> 00:34:59,880
Sir,

578
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:01,580
what does this mean?

579
00:35:01,610 --> 00:35:02,910
At this point,

580
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,910
if you keep protecting this demon girl,

581
00:35:06,000 --> 00:35:08,040
we'll have no choice but to go to Shushan.

582
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:11,340
Even though the Sword Sovereign Fengyue is gone,

583
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:12,970
the Sect Leader of Shushan

584
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,840
will surely give us justice.

585
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:19,240
Give us a clear answer today,

586
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,600
will you eliminate this demon girl or not?

587
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,200
If that's the case,

588
00:35:27,360 --> 00:35:28,840
I'll take Wu Chen back.

589
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:29,600
Immortal Lord,

590
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,480
you are a sword immortal,

591
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:34,320
and not only will you not eliminate this demon girl,

592
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,120
but you even want to take her with you.

593
00:35:39,560 --> 00:35:40,640
Immortal Lord,

594
00:35:41,160 --> 00:35:43,560
I believe this demon girl has bewitched you,

595
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:45,400
clouding your judgment.

596
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:45,920
Exactly!

597
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,660
Immortal Lord, your actions should only be bound

598
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:52,320
by the rules and laws of Shushan.

599
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,360
Fine,

600
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,440
for the sake of peace,

601
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:57,840
we will take care of this demon girl ourselves.

602
00:35:58,240 --> 00:35:59,760
You can leave now.

603
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:00,520
Let's do it!

604
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,600
Go!

605
00:36:02,680 --> 00:36:03,480
Hurry!

606
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,360
Hurry up!

607
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,160
Sir,

608
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,160
you mustn't do this.

609
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:10,760
What you're doing is nothing but senselessly killing the innocent.

610
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,610
Sir, hurry!

611
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,210
-Wu Chen.
-Immortal Lord.

612
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:14,880
Wu Chen!

613
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:18,440
Everyone knows that Shushan's rules

614
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:21,640
forbid using magic on ordinary villagers.

615
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:22,560
Are you

616
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:26,140
really going to break Shushan's ancient teachings?

617
00:36:26,170 --> 00:36:27,560
I can't believe that you, a sword immortal,

618
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:28,970
have been enchanted by this demon girl.

619
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:31,120
Shushan sword immortals have always been tasked with slaying demons and fighting evil,

620
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,000
but today you're involved with a demon girl.

621
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,170
It's a disgrace to the immortal sects.

622
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:34,960
Exactly!

623
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:35,740
What sword immortal?

624
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,690
What a shame.

625
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:39,040
A disciple like that should be expelled from the sect.

626
00:36:39,250 --> 00:36:40,870
Expelled from the sect!

627
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:42,370
Expelled from the sect!

628
00:36:42,390 --> 00:36:43,720
Expelled from the sect!

629
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,810
Expelled from the sect!

630
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:45,520
Fine,

631
00:36:46,600 --> 00:36:48,360
I won't use the immortal sect's magic to save her.

632
00:36:49,490 --> 00:36:50,930
I'll save her with my own strength.

633
00:36:51,630 --> 00:36:52,720
Is that acceptable?

634
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:10,560
Hurry!

635
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,480
Run!

636
00:37:13,120 --> 00:37:13,760
Quickly!

637
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,640
Hua,

638
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,210
I can't run anymore.

639
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:18,070
Wu Chen,

640
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:19,600
hurry up and run!

641
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:21,140
If they find you,

642
00:37:21,360 --> 00:37:22,880
they'll burn you alive.

643
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,160
Why would they burn me alive?

644
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:26,960
Because you're a demon.

645
00:37:27,550 --> 00:37:28,600
I'm a demon,

646
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,840
so I should be burned?

647
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:33,040
Demons always harm others,

648
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:35,710
so they must be executed.

649
00:37:35,960 --> 00:37:37,290
But Hua,

650
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,760
I've never harmed anyone.

651
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:41,160
Didn't I tell you?

652
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:42,520
Don't push me.

653
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:45,400
I can't control the coldness in my body.

654
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,010
Hurry, catch the demon girl!

655
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:50,400
Over there!

656
00:37:57,280 --> 00:37:58,170
Wu Chen,

657
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,360
you don't need to say anything further.

658
00:38:00,380 --> 00:38:01,980
No one will believe you now.

659
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:04,020
Then why do you believe in me?

660
00:38:04,040 --> 00:38:05,320
Why do you want to save me?

661
00:38:05,360 --> 00:38:06,960
I know you haven't harmed anyone.

662
00:38:07,030 --> 00:38:08,560
Hurry up and run!

663
00:38:08,740 --> 00:38:10,630
But what will happen to Mo Xiao

664
00:38:10,660 --> 00:38:12,300
after I leave?

665
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,990
At a time like this, you're still worried about him?

666
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:17,640
Once you reach the village entrance,

667
00:38:17,700 --> 00:38:19,270
head right.

668
00:38:19,440 --> 00:38:20,560
There's the Goddess Temple there.

669
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:22,050
Seek refuge there.

670
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:23,910
We'll talk about what comes next later.

671
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:26,200
I'll take your advice.

672
00:38:26,320 --> 00:38:28,170
When you see Mo Xiao,

673
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:29,670
tell him to come find me.

674
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:30,500
Alright.

675
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:31,970
Now go quickly.

676
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:33,400
Hurry!

677
00:38:36,200 --> 00:38:37,080
Hua,

678
00:38:37,130 --> 00:38:39,190
you're a woman with magic.

679
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,280
You're beautiful.

680
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,560
Hurry up and go.

681
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:44,240
Go quickly!

682
00:38:51,300 --> 00:38:52,920
Hurry, catch the demon girl!

683
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,040
Over there!

684
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:01,520
Catch the demon girl!

685
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:04,800
Don't let her escape!

686
00:39:12,460 --> 00:39:13,560
Immortal Lord.

687
00:39:27,800 --> 00:39:29,280
Have you received any news about Mo Xiao?

688
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,680
His token has returned with a message.

689
00:39:31,700 --> 00:39:33,900
He'll be back soon to report in.

690
00:39:34,630 --> 00:39:35,470
That's good.

691
00:39:36,360 --> 00:39:38,040
As long as he returns safely.

692
00:39:39,620 --> 00:39:40,440
(Luntian Pavilion)

693
00:39:40,440 --> 00:39:41,240
What's wrong?
(Luntian Pavilion)

694
00:39:41,240 --> 00:39:41,880
(Luntian Pavilion)

695
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,960
Do you have something else to say?
(Luntian Pavilion)

696
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:46,880
There's news from Mang Mountain.

697
00:39:47,370 --> 00:39:49,770
The villagers are gossiping,

698
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:52,990
claiming that the Shushan Immortal Lord is sheltering a demon girl.

699
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,980
Mo Xiao is sheltering a demon girl?

700
00:39:55,010 --> 00:39:56,530
The villagers are saying that

701
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:56,620
(Luntian Pavilion)
The villagers are saying that

702
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:56,650
(Luntian Pavilion)

703
00:39:56,650 --> 00:39:58,610
Mo Xiao went up the mountain to slay demons,
(Luntian Pavilion)

704
00:39:58,610 --> 00:39:58,880
(Luntian Pavilion)

705
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,110
but when he came back,
(Luntian Pavilion)

706
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,120
he brought a mysterious woman with him.

707
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:04,520
This woman possesses demonic powers.

708
00:40:04,640 --> 00:40:07,080
She might be the last survivor of the snow demons.

709
00:40:09,730 --> 00:40:13,300
(Goddess Temple)

710
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:19,240
Is anyone here?

711
00:40:50,930 --> 00:40:52,250
Are you hungry again?

712
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:55,280
Mo Xiao,

713
00:40:56,520 --> 00:40:58,200
I knew you wouldn't leave me behind,

714
00:40:58,220 --> 00:40:59,540
since you were the one who brought me down the mountain.

715
00:41:01,540 --> 00:41:02,770
I brought you down,

716
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,280
so it's only right that I take responsibility for you.

717
00:41:04,560 --> 00:41:06,350
Leaving you at Mang Mountain Village

718
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,540
was careless of me.

719
00:41:08,140 --> 00:41:09,400
I almost got you into trouble.

720
00:41:09,930 --> 00:41:11,220
Now that you understand,

721
00:41:11,250 --> 00:41:12,980
please don't let it happen again.

722
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,400
What are you doing?

723
00:42:00,570 --> 00:42:01,490
Boiling some water.

724
00:42:02,130 --> 00:42:03,290
But this stove...

725
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,520
I didn't know there were things you couldn't do.

726
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:08,400
It's not that I can't do it.

727
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,040
I know I need to use the stove to boil water,

728
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:12,520
but before, it was always Zisu who helped me.

729
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,400
I remember this is how it's done.

730
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:16,600
Let go.

731
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,360
I'll do it.

732
00:42:17,830 --> 00:42:18,630
You'll do it?

733
00:42:19,560 --> 00:42:20,720
This is how you do it.

734
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:30,560
See?

735
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:32,020
It's quite simple.
