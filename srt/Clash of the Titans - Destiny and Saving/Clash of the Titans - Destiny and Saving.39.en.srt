00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,680
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
(Episode 39)

3
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:06,120
Chongguang,

4
00:02:07,400 --> 00:02:09,729
I never expected you to be so incompetent.

5
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:11,670
Looks like I,

6
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:15,240
Murong Changfeng, am going to take over.

7
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:16,880
Father.

8
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:20,840
Ce?

9
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:23,180
Don't you go to Sword Pavilion every night

10
00:02:23,180 --> 00:02:25,120
to pay respects to the Sword Sovereigns?

11
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,570
Why are you here?

12
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:28,460
And what's inside

13
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,960
this giant cauldron?

14
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:32,000
Ce,

15
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:33,470
come.

16
00:02:34,040 --> 00:02:35,040
Come, come here.

17
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:41,120
Ce,

18
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:42,890
now that it has come to this,

19
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,000
there's something I don't want to hide from you anymore.

20
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:46,880
I'm going to

21
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:49,730
achieve something great.

22
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,530
Once I succeed,

23
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:53,240
you and I, father and son,

24
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,240
will reign over the three realms.

25
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,220
Originally,

26
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,520
I planned to use Demon Lord Chongguang's assault on Mount Buzhou

27
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:03,370
as an opportunity to use Mo Xiao

28
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,100
to open the seal of the Millennium Token.

29
00:03:06,240 --> 00:03:08,020
But I didn't expect

30
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:11,140
Chongguang to be so useless.

31
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:13,440
Now that the Heavenly Demon Token has been destroyed,

32
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:15,410
we can no longer control Mo Xiao.

33
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,410
So it looks like

34
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,290
there are some things I have to handle myself.

35
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:21,280
Father,

36
00:03:22,079 --> 00:03:24,640
as Shushan Sect Leader, you're betraying your own sect.

37
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,040
You're putting the reputation of the Shushan Sect at stake.

38
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:27,640
Moreover,

39
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:30,960
Mount Buzhou is protected by layers of formations set up by the disciples guarding the Token,

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:33,640
and there's also the seal personally placed by Sword Sovereign Fengyue.

41
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,440
How could you possibly succeed?

42
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,280
Father,

43
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:38,640
stop being so delusional.

44
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:39,880
Turn back now.

45
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:40,920
Ce,

46
00:03:43,079 --> 00:03:44,290
it's because I'm now

47
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,600
the Sect Leader of Shushan

48
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,820
that there are certain things

49
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,200
that must be done by me.

50
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:53,829
I must open the seal of Fengyue Sword.

51
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:54,760
Father,

52
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:57,150
stop being so stubborn.

53
00:03:57,200 --> 00:03:58,860
It's not too late to turn back.

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:00,280
I'll accompany you

55
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,600
to Sword Pavilion to confess your mistakes.

56
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:04,330
The elders of each branch will surely show mercy.

57
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:05,400
Ce,

58
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:09,300
I never thought you would be so naive.

59
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,590
Do you think that I, your father,

60
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,570
would kneel before others and beg for mercy?

61
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:19,519
When I succeed,

62
00:04:19,920 --> 00:04:22,530
it will be them who kneel and beg for mercy.

63
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,800
Understand?

64
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,200
Father,

65
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,250
I won't let you go.

66
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,640
Unless you kill me!

67
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,760
Let go of me.

68
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:44,340
Let go!

69
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:47,659
You ungrateful child.

70
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:50,940
You are truly outrageous.

71
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:54,010
Don't blame me for being merciless.

72
00:05:03,480 --> 00:05:04,440
Father!

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,080
I never thought

74
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,560
you would be so incapable!

75
00:05:18,520 --> 00:05:19,450
Father!

76
00:05:20,440 --> 00:05:21,710
Father, don't go!

77
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:22,680
Father!

78
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:27,210
Father!

79
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,460
I'm begging you, Father!

80
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:34,630
Father...

81
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:45,490
Lingyun?

82
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:54,780
Lingyun,

83
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,500
you're finally awake.

84
00:05:57,120 --> 00:05:58,680
What took you so long to wake up?

85
00:05:58,680 --> 00:05:59,480
Do you know

86
00:05:59,560 --> 00:06:00,580
how difficult it was for me

87
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,040
while you were not around?

88
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,760
Sorry, Jing.

89
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:07,080
I made you worry.

90
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,100
But now...

91
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,300
I'm fine, aren't I?

92
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:26,000
I...

93
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:27,560
I should tell Master Xuan Zhen

94
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:29,400
and Master Xie about this now.

95
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,800
They will surely be very happy.

96
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:37,360
Jing, you said Lingyun is awake?

97
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:38,690
How is his mental state?

98
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:40,650
Lingyun,

99
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:41,820
you're really awake?

100
00:06:41,820 --> 00:06:43,000
Are you hungry?

101
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,120
What would you like to eat?

102
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:45,640
I'll have the kitchen prepare it for you.

103
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,280
Father,

104
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,520
I'm fine.

105
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,680
I don't think

106
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,370
we should be in such a hurry.

107
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,960
Let's observe him for a while and decide later.

108
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:54,640
Alright.

109
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:57,920
Ce!

110
00:06:59,040 --> 00:06:59,480
Hurry!

111
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,940
Stop him!

112
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:02,600
My father is going to Mount Buzhou

113
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:03,920
to seize the Millennium Token!

114
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:04,680
What?

115
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:09,910
I really didn't expect him

116
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,780
to be so ruthless.

117
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,010
He killed Senior,

118
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:16,410
forced Mo Xiao to leave,

119
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,420
and he didn't even let go

120
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:19,240
of his own son.

121
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:22,570
I can't believe so much has happened

122
00:07:23,200 --> 00:07:25,040
while I was in a coma.

123
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:27,490
Master Murong...

124
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:31,950
Masters,

125
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,180
my father has fallen into madness

126
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,670
and won't turn back.

127
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,870
The most urgent thing now

128
00:07:38,040 --> 00:07:41,480
is to expose his conspiracy in front of all the immortal sects.

129
00:07:41,480 --> 00:07:43,620
Otherwise, if they remain unaware of the truth,

130
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,280
they will still be manipulated by him,

131
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:46,080
and who knows

132
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:49,850
how many more disciples will die unjustly.

133
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:52,560
You're right.

134
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,900
This concerns the Millennium Token.

135
00:07:55,380 --> 00:07:57,409
Whether he's colluding with the Demon Sect

136
00:07:57,409 --> 00:07:59,270
or has turned against them,

137
00:08:00,260 --> 00:08:02,020
the immortal sects

138
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,330
are still being deceived by him.

139
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:06,190
If he uses his position as the Sect Leader of Shushan

140
00:08:06,190 --> 00:08:07,430
to manipulate them,

141
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,800
the consequences will be unimaginable.

142
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,820
But he is still the Sect Leader of Shushan,

143
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,550
the head of the immortal sects.

144
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:15,530
How can we make

145
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,650
all the immortal sects believe us?

146
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:23,480
There's a way.

147
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,160
The token?

148
00:08:31,890 --> 00:08:33,600
Why is it in your possession?

149
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,200
Mo Xiao gave it to me.

150
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,870
Take this back.

151
00:08:37,280 --> 00:08:38,210
If Master Murong

152
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:40,120
makes any moves that may put Shushan at a disadvantage,

153
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,490
give it to Master Xie

154
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:42,960
and ask him to strip Master Murong

155
00:08:42,960 --> 00:08:46,620
of his position as Sect Leader in accordance with Shushan's laws.

156
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:56,450
Senior Yuan died unjustly.

157
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,130
His intentions were profound.

158
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:00,060
Although Mo Xiao is not in Shushan,

159
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:03,260
we must protect Shushan Sect

160
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:05,040
and

161
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:06,700
the Millennium Token.

162
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:22,460
Nihuang! Nihuang! Nihuang!

163
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,120
Nihuang?

164
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:44,320
Ni...

165
00:09:46,280 --> 00:09:47,560
Nihuang...

166
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,480
Why did I suddenly call out this name?

167
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:34,920
Bai Yan.

168
00:10:39,280 --> 00:10:39,960
Nihuang?

169
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,040
Lixue.

170
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,200
Why did you go out so early in the morning?

171
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,040
There are still many things to be purchased.

172
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:02,600
I went to the nearby market

173
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:03,600
to buy some.

174
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:05,970
What did you buy?

175
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:08,020
How about this?

176
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:09,790
Go and catch two fish for me,

177
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:11,760
and there'll be a surprise for you when you return.

178
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:12,720
What surprise?

179
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:14,680
Just go.

180
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,800
You'll know when you return.

181
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:16,360
Okay.

182
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:34,540
(Wedding)

183
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,200
Master drinks three different kinds of tea each day.

184
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,000
In the morning,

185
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,880
we need to prepare White Jade Nectar Tea.

186
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:52,760
After the midday nap,

187
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:54,520
we need to prepare Cloud Mountain Longevity Tea

188
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:55,520
to dispel internal heat and purge toxins.

189
00:11:55,520 --> 00:11:58,240
The God of War sealed the Millennium Token for 1,000 years

190
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,200
and has finally awakened and returned.

191
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:02,800
This is truly an auspicious sign for the three realms.

192
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:03,960
For the sake of the three realms,

193
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,830
Bai Yan,

194
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,780
your sacrifices are immense.

195
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,100
My name is Nihuang.

196
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,950
I came because I lost someone dear to me.

197
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:11,930
I heard

198
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:14,120
that the Hundred-Feather Spirit Fan could bring me to the place

199
00:12:14,120 --> 00:12:17,320
where I can summon back the scattered primordial spirit.

200
00:12:23,490 --> 00:12:25,160
Floren. Floren!

201
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:26,420
Master.

202
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,080
Help me find out

203
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:30,600
who Bai Yan

204
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,420
and Nihuang are.

205
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,130
Why did you suddenly mention these two names?

206
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:36,610
I don't know why,

207
00:12:36,680 --> 00:12:38,320
but ever since I came out of the Heavenly Demon Abyss,

208
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,920
memories of someone else have been surfacing in my mind,

209
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,850
constantly mentioning these two.

210
00:12:42,080 --> 00:12:44,600
But every time I tried to focus and trace back,

211
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,280
I was overwhelmed by unbearable pain.

212
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:46,880
Master,

213
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,450
Master, your immortal spirit has finally awakened.

214
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,920
Immortal spirit?

215
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:54,960
Bai Yan is your name in the Heavenly Realm.

216
00:12:54,960 --> 00:12:57,120
You are the mighty God of War renowned across the Heavenly Realm,

217
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,340
Bai Yan.

218
00:12:58,680 --> 00:12:59,600
Bai Yan?

219
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:02,040
The God of War?

220
00:13:06,150 --> 00:13:07,230
If that's the case,

221
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:09,520
in this lifetime,

222
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,610
is Lixue Nihuang?

223
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:18,270
Lixue is Nihuang.

224
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,520
I used the Loong Pearl

225
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:23,080
to conceal your flame aura,

226
00:13:23,240 --> 00:13:24,600
causing you to fall into the Banished Immortal Terrace

227
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,860
and be reborn as a mortal.

228
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:25,960
♫Knowing the subtlety of my feelings, understanding the words I cannot fully express♫

229
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:26,920

262
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:34,330
(Come to Mount Buzhou if you want to save Feng Lixue.)

263
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:50,440
Mother.

264
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:54,360
How is it?

265
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,470
Any news from Mo Xiao?

266
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,600
This is a secret letter my brother had Floren deliver.

267
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:07,800
I didn't expect Chongguang

268
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:10,730
to have laid such a grand plan in Shushan Sect as well.

269
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:13,000
Still no news from the Formless Palace?

270
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,360
The destruction of the Heavenly Demon Token

271
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:16,090
was a heavy blow to Chongguang.

272
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,640
Additionally, after Lixue jumped into the Heavenly Demon Abyss,

273
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,160
the backlash from the Ice Blue Moth

274
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:20,620
has kept him in seclusion.

275
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:21,760
Mother,

276
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:23,400
what should we do now?

277
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,180
Star Lord Xuyuan,

278
00:16:46,210 --> 00:16:47,610
long time no see.

279
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,320
You still remember me?

280
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:06,980
Star Lord Ji,

281
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,609
sorry for making you suffer in the Demon Prison for so long.

282
00:17:09,609 --> 00:17:10,290
I'm here

283
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,190
to get you out of here.

284
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,510
To get me out of here?

285
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:18,210
Did Chongguang send you?

286
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,040
When you were thrown into

287
00:17:20,060 --> 00:17:21,859
the Demon Prison by Chongguang,

288
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:23,520
I told you

289
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,010
to endure a little longer

290
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:28,240
and promised I'd come to get you out personally

291
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,160
when the time came.

292
00:17:31,170 --> 00:17:32,330
So,

293
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:35,120
does that mean the time has come?

294
00:17:37,100 --> 00:17:37,750
Yes.

295
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,580
You've found your son?

296
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,400
We've already met him before.

297
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,440
He is the successor of Sword Sovereign Fengyue,

298
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:48,080
Mo Xiao.

299
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:50,460
He's in Shushan Sect?

300
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:53,600
Well...

301
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,990
So Yuan Beichen knows

302
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:00,360
he's the son of Yeyuan?

303
00:18:10,790 --> 00:18:13,350
He raised the son of Yeyuan?

304
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:21,100
He raised the Young Supreme Lord of the Heavenly Demon Sect?

305
00:18:28,760 --> 00:18:29,820
I'm also here today

306
00:18:30,520 --> 00:18:31,960
to give you something.

307
00:18:32,680 --> 00:18:35,680
It's something Mo Xiao's Master asked him to give you.

308
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,870
The Dark Soul Whip?

309
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:55,790
He made it.

310
00:18:57,890 --> 00:18:59,690
He asked Mo Xiao to bring it to me?

311
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:02,400
Has he been to Mount Suyu?

312
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:03,840
He...

313
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:08,590
He's already passed away.

314
00:19:09,950 --> 00:19:11,480
This is what he left for you.

315
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:13,960
Passed away?

316
00:19:16,350 --> 00:19:17,700
He took his own life

317
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,100
in Shushan Sect.

318
00:19:24,530 --> 00:19:25,980
He's dead?

319
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:30,280
Because Mo Xiao's

320
00:19:30,870 --> 00:19:33,070
identity as Yeyuan's son was revealed,

321
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,580
the immortal sects

322
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,300
regarded him as a demon too.

323
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,760
Unable to bear the disgrace,

324
00:19:39,220 --> 00:19:40,820
he took his own life to atone.

325
00:19:42,870 --> 00:19:43,710
No.

326
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:47,120
It can't be.

327
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:48,540
How could this happen?

328
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:51,700
He hasn't even apologized to me.

329
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,360
He hasn't admitted he was wrong.

330
00:19:56,870 --> 00:19:58,300
How could he die?

331
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:00,800
How could he die?

332
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:03,940
How could he die?

333
00:20:14,080 --> 00:20:15,880
He destroyed your Dark Soul Whip

334
00:20:16,230 --> 00:20:18,110
and left you a new one.

335
00:20:18,130 --> 00:20:20,260
That was his way of apologizing to you.

336
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:22,360
Star Lord Ji,

337
00:20:24,600 --> 00:20:26,060
you should let it go now.

338
00:20:39,650 --> 00:20:41,300
The world is now in chaos,

339
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,240
with the lines between the immortal and demon paths blurred.

340
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:49,890
Star Lord Ji, please accept my condolences.

341
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,320
Come with me.

342
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,840
We have more important things to attend to.

343
00:20:58,200 --> 00:21:00,450
(Mount Buzhou)

344
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:06,590
Master,

345
00:21:06,760 --> 00:21:08,080
did you call me back in such a hurry

346
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:10,280
because you plan to activate the Millennium Token yourself?

347
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:11,560
The Heavenly Demon Token has been destroyed.

348
00:21:11,560 --> 00:21:13,090
Chongguang is now useless.

349
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:14,720
As long as I lure Mo Xiao here,

350
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,920
I can still seize the Millennium Token.

351
00:21:17,000 --> 00:21:17,750
Master,

352
00:21:18,160 --> 00:21:19,920
Chongguang is just in seclusion to recuperate.

353
00:21:19,920 --> 00:21:20,910
If he wakes up

354
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,560
and finds that you've gone to seize the token yourself,

355
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,120
he will definitely head straight for Mount Buzhou.

356
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:25,120
And with Mo Xiao there,

357
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:26,600
you will be facing both of them alone, which is quite dangerous.

358
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:27,160
How about...

359
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,020
How about what?

360
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,460
How can one achieve greatness

361
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,120
by being timid and hesitant?

362
00:21:33,920 --> 00:21:34,740
Right now,

363
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:36,520
for Feng Lixue, Mo Xiao has

364
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:38,160
given up the title of Demon Lord

365
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,320
and fled Mount Suyu.

366
00:21:39,960 --> 00:21:41,440
Meanwhile, inside Chongguang,

367
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,770
there is an Ice Blue Moth

368
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:45,000
that links his life to Feng Lixue's.

369
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:47,180
Now, as long as we have Feng Lixue,

370
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:50,160
the two of them will definitely be under my control.

371
00:21:50,160 --> 00:21:50,890
Understand?

372
00:21:57,640 --> 00:21:58,680
Carry her on your back

373
00:21:58,680 --> 00:21:59,610
and hide for now.

374
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:17,700
Junior Xie,

375
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,000
Junior Xuan Zhen,

376
00:22:19,080 --> 00:22:20,520
why are you all here?

377
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,200
Grand Master Qingyang and Grand Master Qingxu are here too?

378
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:24,020
Looks like

379
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:26,520
you've all received the news that Chongguang from the Demon Sect

380
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,920
is planning to seize the Millennium Token.

381
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:30,200
Murong Changfeng,

382
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:32,920
stop pretending.

383
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:35,870
As the Sect Leader of Shushan,

384
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:38,240
you harmed disciples of the immortal sects,

385
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:40,100
poisoned the former Sect Leader,

386
00:22:40,160 --> 00:22:42,960
and even forced Mo Xiao, the successor of Fengyue Sword, to leave.

387
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:43,640
And now,

388
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:46,160
you want to steal what you were meant to protect

389
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:48,600
and are plotting to seize the Millennium Token.

390
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,840
All your crimes have been fully confirmed.

391
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,120
Today, with all the leaders of the immortal sects

392
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:54,560
gathered here as witnesses,

393
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,440
I, Xie Tianjun, will take you back to Shushan Sect myself

394
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,300
to confess before the ancestral Sword Sovereigns.

395
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,360
Junior Xie,

396
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:06,960
all my crimes?

397
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:10,080
What on earth are you talking about?

398
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:12,210
I received word

399
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,480
that the Heavenly Demon Sect is once again

400
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,360
plotting to seize the Millennium Token.

401
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:18,760
I came to Mount Buzhou to strengthen the seal.

402
00:23:18,760 --> 00:23:20,530
Isn't this what I should do

403
00:23:20,560 --> 00:23:22,220
as the Sect Leader of Shushan?

404
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:23,260
Why are you

405
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,920
slandering me today

406
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:26,770
in front of all the sect leaders

407
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,280
and all these disciples?

408
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,720
Ce!

409
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:44,980
Lingxiang,

410
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,700
do you recognize this man?

411
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:55,940
Before all the sect leaders, tell everyone—

412
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:57,640
is he the lord who made you

413
00:23:58,080 --> 00:23:59,140
a shadow assassin?

414
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:00,730
Murong Ce,

415
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,000
you brat, what nonsense are you talking about?

416
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:05,530
Are you trying to incite others

417
00:24:05,530 --> 00:24:07,070
to slander your own father?

418
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:08,640
Father,

419
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:12,000
years ago, when I left the mountain to travel with you,

420
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,060
we saved a pair of orphaned siblings.

421
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,460
Back then, you told me

422
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,700
you had them adopted by a wealthy family.

423
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:18,990
But years later,

424
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:22,520
I saw with my own eyes that Lingxiang had become a shadow assassin.

425
00:24:22,520 --> 00:24:23,680
How do you

426
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:25,520
explain that?

427
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

428
00:24:26,960 --> 00:24:27,760
What orphans?

429
00:24:32,760 --> 00:24:33,590
Lingxiang,

430
00:24:33,880 --> 00:24:35,480
do you still not understand?

431
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,540
He's been using you all along.

432
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:40,440
Xiang!

433
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:42,480
Xiang!

434
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:51,790
Xiang!

435
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:53,390
Ming?

436
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,660
You are Ming?

437
00:24:55,590 --> 00:24:56,610
Ming...

438
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,520
Xiang.

439
00:25:03,880 --> 00:25:04,830
Xiang,

440
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,310
Master said

441
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,870
he sent you to a wealthy family in the southern region to live out your days.

442
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:10,230
How come you're here?

443
00:25:11,190 --> 00:25:14,550
Didn't you go to Li State in the north to serve as a deputy general?

444
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:15,750
Why are you here?

445
00:25:24,710 --> 00:25:26,840
So you've been lying to us all along.

446
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:30,600
You've been telling me he is doing well,

447
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,150
living without worries, with a bright future ahead,

448
00:25:33,150 --> 00:25:35,810
and that's why I've been willingly serving you.

449
00:25:36,160 --> 00:25:36,940
But in reality,

450
00:25:36,940 --> 00:25:39,440
you've just been using us as leverage to threaten each other,

451
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,580
treating us as your pawns.

452
00:25:41,880 --> 00:25:43,120
Without my shelter,

453
00:25:44,080 --> 00:25:46,940
you two orphans wouldn't have survived to this day.

454
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:48,620
As the Sect Leader of Shushan,

455
00:25:49,090 --> 00:25:52,340
you dare raise shadow assassins

456
00:25:52,610 --> 00:25:54,300
to cause chaos in Fengdu City

457
00:25:54,600 --> 00:25:56,930
and harm disciples of the immortal sects.

458
00:25:56,950 --> 00:25:59,010
You even colluded with the Demon Sect,

459
00:25:59,010 --> 00:26:00,560
using Rootless Flower's poison

460
00:26:00,560 --> 00:26:02,290
to harm the former Sect Leader.

461
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,340
Every single crime you committed

462
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:07,780
could send you straight to Tielyv Prison

463
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:10,240
and cast you into the Demon Subduing Palace!

464
00:26:10,780 --> 00:26:11,800
Today,

465
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,640
with the Sect Leader's Token,

466
00:26:14,410 --> 00:26:16,250
I will carry out the will of the previous Sect Leader

467
00:26:16,250 --> 00:26:17,910
and dismiss Murong Changfeng

468
00:26:18,090 --> 00:26:20,390
from the position of Shushan Sect Leader,

469
00:26:20,390 --> 00:26:22,850
taking him back to Shushan to face judgment.

470
00:26:26,890 --> 00:26:28,280
You think you can?

471
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,320
You two insignificant creatures?

472
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:34,870
Let me tell you,

473
00:26:35,010 --> 00:26:37,620
Shushan Sect is my Shushan Sect.

474
00:26:37,760 --> 00:26:38,730
Only with me here,

475
00:26:38,730 --> 00:26:41,570
the Immortal Sect of Shushan can grow stronger.

476
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:42,760
You...

477
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,720
can't touch a single hair on me.

478
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,860
Father, please turn back!

479
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,090
For me and my brother!

480
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,300
-Please!
-Jing!

481
00:27:25,320 --> 00:27:26,380
Murong Changfeng,

482
00:27:26,920 --> 00:27:28,250
stop being so stubborn.

483
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:33,140
Otherwise, don't blame us for not considering our bond as fellow disciples!

484
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:08,840
Xiang!

485
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,140
Murong Changfeng has mastered the demonic techniques.

486
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:19,430
Let's go together!

487
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,570
The Magic of Mystery?

488
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:51,360
I didn't expect that Murong Changfeng had fallen onto the demonic path.

489
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:54,870
(Mount Buzhou)

490
00:28:58,760 --> 00:28:59,500
Xiang.

491
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:03,550
Xiang.

492
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,680
Xiang...

493
00:29:18,350 --> 00:29:19,950
-Xiang...
-Ming...

494
00:29:20,420 --> 00:29:21,400
Xiang...

495
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,720
Xiang!

496
00:30:11,740 --> 00:30:12,840
Junior Xuan Zhen,

497
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:15,620
Senior Qingyang, Senior Qingxu.

498
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,410
I never expected

499
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:19,360
that Murong Changfeng has mastered

500
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:21,680
the Magic of Mystery from the Millennium Token.

501
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,640
What should

502
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:24,640
we do next?

503
00:30:35,610 --> 00:30:36,290
Mo Xiao,

504
00:30:37,290 --> 00:30:38,890
I misunderstood you before.

505
00:30:39,290 --> 00:30:39,930
I'm sorry.

506
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:47,200
Mo Xiao.

507
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,350
Mo Xiao,

508
00:30:50,720 --> 00:30:51,650
you're too late.

509
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:53,520
We couldn't stop him,

510
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,160
and he's already stormed into Mount Buzhou.

511
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:57,280
If there's any disturbance on Mount Buzhou,

512
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,280
demons from all over the world will take the opportunity to cause chaos.

513
00:30:59,280 --> 00:30:59,840
So,

514
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,540
I sincerely ask you

515
00:31:01,760 --> 00:31:03,120
to return to your respective immortal sects

516
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:04,400
and guard your immortal mountains.

517
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,640
Leave this place to me.

518
00:31:05,640 --> 00:31:06,880
Jing, Lingyun, Murong Ce,

519
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,080
come with me to Mount Buzhou

520
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,280
to keep reinforcing the Millennium Token's seal

521
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,940
and subdue Murong Changfeng.

522
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:13,700
Mo Xiao,

523
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:16,200
we'll entrust

524
00:31:16,760 --> 00:31:18,360
the Millennium Token to you.

525
00:31:18,440 --> 00:31:19,990
We were blinded by a villain

526
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:23,490
and failed to see the good intentions of Sword Sovereign Fengyue and Sect Leader Yuan,

527
00:31:23,490 --> 00:31:25,350
causing you to suffer injustice.

528
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:27,960
Today, the immortal sects are in danger.

529
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,720
We hope you'll set aside past grudges

530
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,320
and protect the Millennium Token for the immortal sects

531
00:31:31,320 --> 00:31:34,050
for the sake of the teachings of your late master.

532
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:35,480
We'll entrust this heavy responsibility

533
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,120
to you,

534
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:39,180
Young Hero Mo Xiao.

535
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:41,040
Immortal Lords, you don't need to be so polite.

536
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:43,160
Protecting the Millennium Token was my master's dying wish.

537
00:31:43,160 --> 00:31:44,400
I swear I will not fail him.

538
00:31:44,400 --> 00:31:45,440
But what if

539
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,940
the Demon Sect makes any other moves?

540
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:49,360
Master Xuan Zhen,

541
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:50,360
I have other plans

542
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:51,720
for that.

543
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:11,320
Today,

544
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:12,940
Star Lord Ji, Elder Minghuang,

545
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:15,110
and I summoned you here

546
00:32:15,240 --> 00:32:17,160
to announce something important.

547
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,400
For years, Demon Lord Chongguang

548
00:32:18,400 --> 00:32:20,520
has been obsessed with seizing the Millennium Token,

549
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:23,720
caring nothing for the safety of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

550
00:32:23,880 --> 00:32:24,800
My son, Mo Xiao,

551
00:32:24,820 --> 00:32:26,800
and Feng Lixue, Star Lord of Shaohao,

552
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:29,000
sacrificed themselves by jumping into the Heavenly Demon Abyss

553
00:32:29,000 --> 00:32:30,720
and destroying the Heavenly Demon Token

554
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:32,240
to thwart Chongguang's plot.

555
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:35,080
Mo Xiao, knowing he is unfit to bear the responsibility of the Supreme Lord of the Heavenly Demon Sect,

556
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:36,630
asked me to tell you that

557
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:39,240
although the Heavenly Demon Sect has lost the Heavenly Demon Token,

558
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,560
the foundation built by our tens of thousands of followers still remains,

559
00:32:41,560 --> 00:32:43,400
and in the future, many new talents will rise

560
00:32:43,400 --> 00:32:44,660
to safeguard our sect.

561
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,880
Masters, please stay

562
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,940
in your own territories

563
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,550
and not be used by others' ambitions.

564
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,310
Young Supreme Lord Mo Xiao

565
00:32:53,340 --> 00:32:55,140
has seen through Chongguang's true intentions.

566
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:57,410
He just wants to use our army of 100 thousand demon soldiers

567
00:32:57,410 --> 00:32:58,650
to storm Mount Buzhou

568
00:32:58,670 --> 00:33:00,470
and seize the Millennium Token.

569
00:33:00,830 --> 00:33:02,480
Now that his plan has failed,

570
00:33:02,780 --> 00:33:04,840
he will surely make a desperate move.

571
00:33:04,980 --> 00:33:06,970
By then, Mount Buzhou will show signs of disturbance,

572
00:33:06,970 --> 00:33:09,600
but the Heavenly Demon Sect will not get involved.

573
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:10,840
Elders, you must

574
00:33:11,300 --> 00:33:13,400
realize one thing as soon as possible:

575
00:33:13,400 --> 00:33:15,720
Throughout history, every time

576
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:18,120
our demon race suffered a disastrous downfall,

577
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:20,250
it was because of an ambitious leader.

578
00:33:20,920 --> 00:33:21,680
Today,

579
00:33:22,120 --> 00:33:24,590
at the warning of the Young Supreme Lord,

580
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,130
we must learn from the past,

581
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,410
stay within our bounds,

582
00:33:28,410 --> 00:33:30,680
and patiently await for a once-in-a-generation talent

583
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,340
to restore the glory of our Heavenly Demon Sect.

584
00:33:36,260 --> 00:33:39,720
Elder, Star Lords, since you have made your intentions clear,

585
00:33:39,920 --> 00:33:40,920
we

586
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:42,720
will obey.

587
00:33:42,800 --> 00:33:44,280
Stay in our lands

588
00:33:44,300 --> 00:33:46,000
and restore the Heavenly Demon Sect!

589
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:47,480
Stay in our lands

590
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:49,570
and restore the Heavenly Demon Sect!

591
00:34:10,070 --> 00:34:11,000
Supreme Lord...

592
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:14,380
Supreme Lord,

593
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,730
Murong Changfeng has taken Feng Lixue hostage

594
00:34:20,170 --> 00:34:22,130
and is heading to Mount Buzhou

595
00:34:23,420 --> 00:34:25,150
to seize the Millennium Token.

596
00:34:58,120 --> 00:34:58,940
Lixue?

597
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,770
Mo Xiao,

598
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,320
your beloved woman

599
00:35:03,950 --> 00:35:05,480
is now in my hands.

600
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,400
Can we have

601
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:09,220
a proper talk now?

602
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,110
What do you want to talk about?

603
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,130
I've already opened two of the three seals

604
00:35:16,310 --> 00:35:18,020
of the Abyss of Infinity.

605
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:21,260
But the third seal

606
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,300
can only be opened with your Fengyue Sword.

607
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:25,980
How about this?

608
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,350
You help me open the third seal,

609
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,560
and I'll return Feng Lixue to you

610
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,060
unharmed.

611
00:35:33,070 --> 00:35:34,090
Master Murong,

612
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:35,580
once the seal is opened,

613
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,380
there's no turning back for you.

614
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:39,500
With the Millennium Token in my hand,

615
00:35:39,840 --> 00:35:41,840
I can reshape the three realms

616
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:43,390
and redefine the universe.

617
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,530
You foolish boy,

618
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:48,460
why would I need a way back?

619
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:49,640
Mo Xiao,

620
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:51,400
hurry and save Lixue!

621
00:35:54,680 --> 00:35:55,360
Nihuang,

622
00:35:56,720 --> 00:36:00,010
you are the Seven-Colored Fire Phoenix that forged the Millennium Token.

623
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,670
Once the seal of the Millennium Token is broken,

624
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:03,560
your true form

625
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:06,140
will be revealed to the three realms.

626
00:36:06,480 --> 00:36:07,320
By then,

627
00:36:08,720 --> 00:36:10,320
I won't have another Loong Pearl

628
00:36:10,320 --> 00:36:11,440
to protect you.

629
00:36:13,990 --> 00:36:14,880
Okay.

630
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:20,880
I'll go open the seal now.

631
00:36:21,350 --> 00:36:22,810
Lingyun, Jing, Murong Ce,

632
00:36:22,810 --> 00:36:24,310
protect me here.

633
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,950
You, Mo Xiao.

634
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:17,450
You tricked me again.

635
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:23,820
Move aside!

636
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,090
Master Murong,

637
00:37:25,290 --> 00:37:26,900
if you stop now,

638
00:37:26,920 --> 00:37:28,080
you'll only face the punishment

639
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,780
of Tielyv Prison and the Demon Subduing Palace.

640
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:31,650
This way, you can still rebuild your cultivation.

641
00:37:31,650 --> 00:37:33,710
But if you insist on seizing the Millennium Token,

642
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,310
it'll be a path of no return.

643
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:40,450
You think you three little brats

644
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:42,710
can scare me?

645
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,570
Father,

646
00:38:07,360 --> 00:38:09,380
even the fiercest tiger doesn't eat its cubs.

647
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:10,840
For the Millennium Token,

648
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:13,710
will you even kill me and Jing?

649
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,740
So a son

650
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,020
can kill his own father?

651
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,520
I am your father.

652
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:27,250
I gave life to both of you.

653
00:38:27,360 --> 00:38:31,090
But now you're helping outsiders to fight against your own father.

654
00:38:31,120 --> 00:38:31,840
Fine.

655
00:38:33,180 --> 00:38:33,920
Father,

656
00:38:34,910 --> 00:38:36,250
from today on,

657
00:38:37,040 --> 00:38:38,160
Jing and I

658
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,600
will sever all ties with you.

659
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,120
I don't have time to waste on words with you.

660
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:15,410
Mo Xiao,

661
00:39:15,950 --> 00:39:17,230
if you dare to trick me again,

662
00:39:17,230 --> 00:39:19,130
I will turn her to dust instantly.

663
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,730
Murong Changfeng!

664
00:39:30,120 --> 00:39:33,120
Who do you think you are to covet the Millennium Token?

665
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:55,290
Chongguang,

666
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,520
You're finally here.

667
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,650
It's good to have ambition.

668
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,690
And you're quite smart,

669
00:40:05,960 --> 00:40:08,680
knowing to place Chang Ming by my side

670
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:13,130
to steal my blood of immortality to forge demonic power.

671
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,620
But you're still foolish.

672
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,540
You think that

673
00:40:17,890 --> 00:40:21,090
by cultivating my Magic of Mystery,

674
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:23,920
you'll be able to obtain the Millennium Token?

675
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,000
Indeed.

676
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:28,070
With just my Magic of Mystery,

677
00:40:29,110 --> 00:40:31,430
I don't have absolute confidence in winning.

678
00:40:31,430 --> 00:40:32,790
But fortunately,

679
00:40:33,670 --> 00:40:35,040
I have her.

680
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:38,440
Feng Lixue

681
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,100
can not only restrain Mo Xiao,

682
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:43,810
but is mainly meant to be used against you.

683
00:40:46,010 --> 00:40:49,720
The Ice Blue Moths inside the two of you share life and death.

684
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:53,510
I hold your life in my hands.

685
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,040
Ice Blue Moths?

686
00:40:56,070 --> 00:40:58,240
Chongguang's repeated leniency toward Lixue

687
00:40:58,240 --> 00:41:00,040
is because of the Ice Blue Moths.

688
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:01,740
If that's the case,

689
00:41:02,320 --> 00:41:03,580
with Chongguang here,

690
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:05,980
Lixue's life is not in immediate danger.

691
00:41:07,560 --> 00:41:09,810
Although you can live forever,

692
00:41:09,880 --> 00:41:12,240
if you want to reconstruct your physical body,

693
00:41:12,240 --> 00:41:14,440
it will still take over a hundred years.

694
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:17,150
By then, my Magic of Mystery

695
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,000
will have already fused with the Millennium Token.

696
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,660
I am the rightful owner of the Millennium Token!

697
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,440
You have really made me mad.

698
00:41:43,210 --> 00:41:44,680
The Magic of Mystery?

699
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,040
The Magic of Mystery comes from the Millennium Token.

700
00:41:47,040 --> 00:41:49,010
Will it affect the seal of the Millennium Token?
