00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,650
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,680
(Episode 33)

3
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,420
I don't want to believe it either.

4
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,240
But I saw it with my own eyes today.

5
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,150
Mo Xiao,

6
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:49,120
this sword strike

7
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:53,320
first, it's for our fellow disciples of the Shushan Sect,

8
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:56,130
second, it's for our brotherhood.

9
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:57,840
From now on,

10
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:00,560
I no longer have you as a brother.

11
00:02:11,020 --> 00:02:12,580
I was born evil.

12
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:18,060
I have no choice.

13
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,800
Okay.

14
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,880
Mo Xiao.

15
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:25,960
I'm sorry.

16
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,000
Mo Xiao!

17
00:03:05,240 --> 00:03:08,120
Mo Xiao!

18
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:57,880
-Mo Xiao!
-Mother.

19
00:03:57,880 --> 00:03:59,160
-Mo Xiao!
-No, Mother.

20
00:03:59,440 --> 00:04:00,600
-Mo Xiao!
-Mother! No! Mother!

21
00:04:00,600 --> 00:04:01,660
-Mo Xiao!
-Mother!

22
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:05,300
Mo Xiao, Mo Xiao!

23
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,920
Mo Xiao!

24
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:09,240
Mo Xiao!

25
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,360
Mo Xiao!

26
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:16,329
Mo Xiao!

27
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,480
Mo Xiao!

28
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,920
Mo Xiao!

29
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:24,480
Mo Xiao!

30
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:25,360
Let's go.

31
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:29,640
The disciple of Shushan Sect is here.

32
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:30,400
Mo Xiao.

33
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,480
-Mo Xiao.
-Mother!

34
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:34,440
Mother.

35
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,520
Mo Xiao!

36
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,360
-Let's go.
-Mo Xiao!

37
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:42,000
Mo Xiao!

38
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:45,080
Mo Xiao.

39
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:47,880
-Lingyun.
-Xie Lingyun.

40
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:48,690
Lingyun.

41
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,040
Lingyun.

42
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:52,960
Xie Lingyun.

43
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,400
Save them! Save them!

44
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:05,280
Save them!

45
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,270
-Save them!
-Lixue.

46
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,280
Save them!

47
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:10,090
-Save them!
-Lixue.

48
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:11,000
Save them!

49
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,320
-Save them!
-Lixue!

50
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:14,380
Save them!

51
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:15,800
Save them!

52
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:16,960
Save them!

53
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,190
Save them, please!

54
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,480
Save them! Save them!

55
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:23,480
Save them! Save them!

56
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:24,280
Save them.

57
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,080
How did she become like this?

58
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:31,660
Supreme Lord,

59
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,520
this Puppet Spell was planted in the Supreme Consort's body.

60
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,960
It has been harmless all this time.

61
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:35,600
Today,

62
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,520
I don't know why this happened either.

63
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,800
Didn't you say that once the Puppet Spell is planted,

64
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,000
the person loses all consciousness

65
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:42,400
and obeys only me?

66
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:43,560
Yes.

67
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,600
Didn't you see

68
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,320
that she didn't respond to my summons just now?

69
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,560
That shouldn't be possible.

70
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:53,240
Supreme Lord,

71
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,300
could it be that...

72
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:55,320
Speak.

73
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,760
Could it be that the Supreme Consort

74
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:59,020
experienced some shock at Shushan Sect?

75
00:06:01,030 --> 00:06:01,360
(Demon Subduing Palace)

76
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:07,400
Are you certain

77
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,080
that once the Puppet Spell is planted,

78
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:11,610
no one can break it?

79
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:12,360
Yes.

80
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:13,660
This Puppet Spell

81
00:06:13,660 --> 00:06:15,240
uses the power of three Sacred Stones

82
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,640
to completely seal a person's consciousness.

83
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,760
Without the

84
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,640
Heavenly Demon Power

85
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,480
of these three Sacred Stones,

86
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:21,740
indeed, no one in this world can break it.

87
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,580
Could it be that your Puppet Spell

88
00:06:29,760 --> 00:06:31,610
has been broken by him?

89
00:06:33,920 --> 00:06:34,810
Chang Ming,

90
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,880
take her back to Shaohao Palace.

91
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,040
Wait,

92
00:06:43,159 --> 00:06:44,560
assign someone to serve her specifically.

93
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,020
There must be no mistakes.

94
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:46,760
Yes.

95
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,100
Senior,

96
00:07:06,360 --> 00:07:09,080
you have sheltered the demon's child in Shushan Sect

97
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,880
and even allowed him to succeed as the Sect Leader.

98
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:14,560
You've put Shushan Sect in danger.

99
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:17,920
The people of the immortal sects have reason to suspect

100
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:18,960
that you're leaning towards the demon side

101
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,820
and have unspeakable ambitions.

102
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:22,200
Today,

103
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:24,320
I can no longer consider our brotherhood.

104
00:07:24,320 --> 00:07:26,400
You must now hand over the Sect Leader's Token

105
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,320
and then turn yourself in to the Tielyu Branch to face punishment.

106
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:31,200
You want the Sect Leader's Token?

107
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:38,300
It's not that I want this token,

108
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:41,280
but this token is crucial to Shushan Sect's survival.

109
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:43,520
It's even more crucial to the safety of Mount Buzhou.

110
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:44,659
How can it fall

111
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:47,280
into the hands of the Demon Sect's allies?

112
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:48,590
If you still care about

113
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:50,280
your reputation today,

114
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:52,720
I suggest you hand it over voluntarily.

115
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:57,000
I stepped down as Sect Leader long ago.

116
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,180
The Sect Leader's Token is not in my possession.

117
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,400
Mo Xiao

118
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,040
didn't have the seal when he entered Demon Subduing Palace.

119
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:08,440
And it's not in the Tiance Villa or the Sword Pavilion either.

120
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,820
I ask you, in this Shushan Sect, besides you,

121
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:14,290
who else could be guarding this token?

122
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,560
So you've already searched for it.

123
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,160
This matter is of great importance.

124
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,880
Of course, I have to consider

125
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,200
the long-term plans for Shushan Sect.

126
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:32,990
Murong Changfeng.

127
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:36,059
You can be the leader of the Shushan Sect,

128
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:39,960
but that would only be an acting leader without the Sect Leader's Token.

129
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,400
The various immortal sects,

130
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:43,330
the divine troops of Mount Buzhou,

131
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:46,620
still need the Shushan Sect leader's token as a symbol.

132
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:50,640
Will you hand it over or not?

133
00:08:56,150 --> 00:08:56,950
Junior,

134
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:01,370
don't be in such a hurry to leave.

135
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,500
You usually

136
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:05,720
have close contact with our senior.

137
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,520
You wouldn't happen to know

138
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,980
where the Sect Leader's Token is, would you?

139
00:09:10,030 --> 00:09:11,280
As you know,

140
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,960
I never involve myself in sect affairs.

141
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,840
My Baicao Branch is only responsible for treating illnesses and saving lives.

142
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,360
As for who becomes the Sect Leader,

143
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:20,880
or what Sect Leader's Token,

144
00:09:20,880 --> 00:09:22,480
it's all irrelevant to me.

145
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:33,080
Senior,

146
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:36,760
since you show no regard for our relationship,

147
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,490
you can't blame me for what happens next.

148
00:09:39,720 --> 00:09:40,200
Come on,

149
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,400
take Yuan Beichen

150
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,600
and escort him to the Tielyu Branch.

151
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,730
No need to escort me.

152
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:48,600
I'll go to the Tielyu Branch myself.

153
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:17,800
Jing.

154
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:19,600
How is Lingyun?

155
00:10:21,840 --> 00:10:23,900
Master Xuan Zhen just checked on him.

156
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:25,330
From what we can see,

157
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:26,880
his life is not in danger.

158
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:29,080
But Mo...

159
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,360
But the Heavenly Demon Power is extremely fierce.

160
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,880
It has severely damaged Brother Lingyun's heart meridian.

161
00:10:35,880 --> 00:10:38,010
He's still unconscious at the moment.

162
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:39,920
Brother,

163
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,130
Shushan Sect...

164
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:44,760
Why has it become like this?

165
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,500
I didn't expect it to turn out like this either.

166
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:53,410
How quickly things can change.

167
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:55,690
Jing,

168
00:10:56,200 --> 00:10:58,240
as the young masters of the four gates of Shushan Sect,

169
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:00,000
we can't afford to dwell on sorrow and grief.

170
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:00,640
Now,

171
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:04,200
there are many things waiting for us to do in Shushan Sect.

172
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:06,800
Brother,

173
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,890
where is Father?

174
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,320
Shushan Sect has been busy with affairs lately.

175
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:11,920
Father

176
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:14,960
is in the hall gathering information from various sources.

177
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:18,890
I also need to go inspect the barriers of the four gates of Shushan Sect.

178
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,240
Brother, you can go about your business.

179
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,440
Don't worry too much.

180
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:23,800
He'll be fine.

181
00:11:40,950 --> 00:11:42,350
(Divine Mechanism Hall)

182
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:52,840
Congratulations, Master Changfeng.

183
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:55,840
You're about to ascend to the position of Sect Leader.

184
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,720
I must congratulate you as well.

185
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,400
Before all the immortal sects,

186
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:04,210
I'll nominate you as the leader of Luntian Branch.

187
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:07,440
You're so young, yet capable of such a great responsibility.

188
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,000
You're bound to achieve great things in the future.

189
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,760
You flatter me, Master Changfeng.

190
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,400
Master Changfeng, your virtue moves heaven.

191
00:12:13,400 --> 00:12:14,860
It's only by chance that we

192
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,960
uncovered the shocking secret

193
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:18,770
about Yuan Beichen and Mo Xiao.

194
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,810
If it weren't for your Soul-Cleansing Spell,

195
00:12:20,810 --> 00:12:23,760
I wouldn't have been able to draw out the demonic nature in Mo Xiao.

196
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:26,480
Mo Xiao wouldn't have exposed his demonic nature,

197
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,940
thus completely revealing his true nature.

198
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:29,880
In the end,

199
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:31,960
it's all thanks to you, Master Changfeng.

200
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,240
My current success

201
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,310
is due to your support, Master Changfeng.

202
00:12:35,310 --> 00:12:37,040
Your kindness in reshaping my fate

203
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,000
is something I will never forget.

204
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:39,960
Good.

205
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,520
You're sensible.

206
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:44,880
Actually, everything I've done

207
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,430
is just going with the flow.

208
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,480
It's not about fighting for fame or glory.

209
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,960
They deserved what they got.

210
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:53,960
But you,

211
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:57,800
the demonic poison in your body hasn't been eliminated yet.

212
00:12:57,800 --> 00:12:58,930
You must be careful.

213
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:02,170
You're about to become the leader of Luntian Branch.

214
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:04,720
If the disciples in the branch discover

215
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,880
that you still have the demonic poison,

216
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:08,880
wouldn't all our efforts be in vain?

217
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,320
Please don't worry, Master Changfeng.

218
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,180
Those who saw my demonic outburst

219
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,810
have already been eliminated.

220
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,450
What did you say?

221
00:13:21,410 --> 00:13:23,080
You killed your fellow disciples?

222
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:24,280
Yes, Master Changfeng.

223
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,610
While pursuing Mo Xiao,

224
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:27,200
the demonic poison unfortunately erupted.

225
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,520
I had no choice

226
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,100
but to go with the flow.

227
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:33,200
If I didn't frame Mo Xiao

228
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,360
for the crime of slaughtering fellow disciples,

229
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:36,360
the young masters

230
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,240
wouldn't easily turn against Mo Xiao.

231
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,640
The immortal sects wouldn't be able to confirm

232
00:13:40,640 --> 00:13:44,520
that Mo Xiao has completely turned to the dark side by killing his fellow disciples.

233
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,800
For our objectives,

234
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:48,560
some sacrifices are necessary.

235
00:14:06,800 --> 00:14:07,660
Remember this.

236
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:10,330
This is the only time.

237
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:12,780
Don't let it happen again.

238
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:13,960
Yes.

239
00:14:15,760 --> 00:14:16,690
What did you say?

240
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,560
You killed

241
00:14:18,680 --> 00:14:20,740
the disciples in the Sword Pavilion?

242
00:14:23,280 --> 00:14:24,040
Jianchuan,

243
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:25,600
you may leave now.

244
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:31,440
So,

245
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:34,360
it was you all along

246
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:37,520
who were secretly framing Mo Xiao and Master Yuan.

247
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:39,260
You heard everything?

248
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:41,560
But why?

249
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:45,600
You're already one of the four Branch Leaders.

250
00:14:46,120 --> 00:14:48,080
Why go to such great lengths?

251
00:14:48,200 --> 00:14:49,460
Why all this scheming?

252
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:52,740
Is it all for the position of Sect Leader?

253
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:54,440
You don't understand

254
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,440
my affairs.

255
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,220
Knowing too much

256
00:14:58,400 --> 00:14:59,760
won't do you any good.

257
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,420
Forget what happened today quickly.

258
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:03,090
This way,

259
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,480
our Fengyu Branch and the Shushan Sect

260
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:07,080
can coexist peacefully.

261
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:09,400
Father,

262
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:11,720
when did you...

263
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:15,080
When did you become like this?

264
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,200
I have never changed.

265
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,880
My love for you all

266
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:21,640
has never wavered.

267
00:15:22,080 --> 00:15:23,720
I didn't let you know about these things

268
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,200
to protect you.

269
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:26,640
Protect us?

270
00:15:27,520 --> 00:15:30,520
By making us the children of the Shushan Sect traitor?

271
00:15:30,680 --> 00:15:32,040
Is that protection?

272
00:15:37,960 --> 00:15:38,890
What do you know?

273
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,200
Do you know that I

274
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:44,720
was once the Sword Sovereign's most prized disciple?

275
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,920
During the immortal sects' gathering,

276
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,960
I was the most glorious and honored.

277
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,320
Everyone believed

278
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:54,200
the position of Sect Leader should be passed to me.

279
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,880
That I should lead the righteous path of the immortal sects.

280
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:58,210
But what happened then?

281
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,600
They actually gave the Fengyue Sword

282
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,240
to a demon's child.

283
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:04,880
What were they doing?

284
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:06,450
Is this upholding justice?

285
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:08,620
Is this saving all living beings?

286
00:16:10,280 --> 00:16:11,140
Let me tell you,

287
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:13,520
this position of Sect Leader

288
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:15,200
should have been mine to begin with.

289
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,080
It's mine now,

290
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,560
and it will be your brother's in the future!

291
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,300
Only our Murong family

292
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:21,980
can be good Sect Leaders

293
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:24,900
and can make the Shushan Sect even more prosperous.

294
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:35,280
Jing,

295
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:39,040
you must believe in your father.

296
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,520
No matter what I do,

297
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:43,700
it's all for you and your brother.

298
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,940
You just need to focus on being

299
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:48,020
the young master of the Fengyu Branch

300
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:50,650
and being my good daughter.

301
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:55,660
I will protect you and ensure you have a peaceful and worry-free life.

302
00:16:57,760 --> 00:16:58,820
Do you understand?

303
00:17:01,200 --> 00:17:03,000
A peaceful and worry-free life?

304
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:06,170
With such despicable thoughts in your heart,

305
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:09,369
how can there be peace and freedom from worry?

306
00:17:10,290 --> 00:17:12,089
What exactly do you want me to do?

307
00:17:12,599 --> 00:17:14,200
I want you to go back,

308
00:17:15,890 --> 00:17:17,400
back to being

309
00:17:18,160 --> 00:17:19,000
that kind

310
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,390
and loving father you once were.

311
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,200
Where should I go back to?

312
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:25,000
I haven't changed at all.

313
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,930
No matter what steps I take,

314
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:30,000
I'll always be your father.

315
00:17:30,120 --> 00:17:30,920
No.

316
00:17:31,040 --> 00:17:33,300
Then I'd rather not have you as my father.

317
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,850
Where are you going?

318
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:37,640
Jing!

319
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:58,280
Senior.

320
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,720
I never expected

321
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,280
that he would be so cruel to you.

322
00:18:11,390 --> 00:18:12,900
His resentment

323
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,770
has been building up in his heart for decades.

324
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:20,390
It was bound to explode eventually.

325
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:21,960
Then why

326
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,720
can't you just tell him the truth?

327
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:24,280
No,

328
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,140
absolutely not.

329
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:31,100
Whether Mo Xiao is on the righteous path or the evil one,

330
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:32,680
his mission

331
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,760
must ultimately be completed.

332
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,170
Before he accomplishes his mission,

333
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,880
we can't reveal a single word.

334
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:41,880
Remember this.

335
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,160
But have you considered

336
00:18:45,520 --> 00:18:46,880
if this continues,

337
00:18:47,790 --> 00:18:50,340
he might actually torture you to death?

338
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:53,200
Don't worry, junior,

339
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,320
I

340
00:18:56,160 --> 00:18:57,600
won't die easily.

341
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:01,320
Before we hear any news of Mo Xiao,

342
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,160
I absolutely won't die easily.

343
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,680
Senior,

344
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,280
do you really believe

345
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,130
that he will definitely stay true to his original intention

346
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:17,720
and complete his mission?

347
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:22,990
For 18 years,

348
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,760
the Sword Sovereign and I

349
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:29,280
have taught and guided him.

350
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,000
Other than believing in him,

351
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,640
I have no other thoughts.

352
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,200
Jinzi, Jinzi!

353
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,320
Look quickly!

354
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:31,560
Look!

355
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:35,080
There's someone over there.

356
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:37,020
Let's row over and take a look.

357
00:20:56,320 --> 00:20:57,200
Lingyun.

358
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:01,880
Why won't you wake up?

359
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:05,520
I want you to tell me

360
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:08,760
what I should do.

361
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,440
He is my father after all.

362
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,810
He's my father.

363
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:48,720
Master,

364
00:21:49,160 --> 00:21:50,360
I've come to see you.

365
00:21:51,680 --> 00:21:54,000
When virtue doesn't match one's position,

366
00:21:54,000 --> 00:21:55,600
disaster is sure to follow.

367
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:57,820
You're not worthy to wear

368
00:21:57,820 --> 00:22:00,500
the robes of the Luntian Branch Leader.

369
00:22:01,040 --> 00:22:02,900
Take them off while you still can.

370
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:20,870
Yuan Beichen.

371
00:22:21,160 --> 00:22:22,160
Even now,

372
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,720
you still look down on me, Lu Jianchuan.

373
00:22:25,720 --> 00:22:27,440
You are my disciple.

374
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:30,760
I have never looked down on you.

375
00:22:33,400 --> 00:22:34,360
As for you,

376
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:37,440
your understanding of the Way is still shallow.

377
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,440
I, as your master, want to save you.

378
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:41,080
Save me?

379
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,340
Stop using these high-sounding excuses

380
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,600
to deceive me.

381
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:48,220
I am no longer the Lu Jianchuan I once was.

382
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,880
You favor Mo Xiao,

383
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:51,480
and deliberately belittle me.

384
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,540
I will no longer be suppressed by you.

385
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:55,480
Now,

386
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:57,780
I am the leader of Luntian Branch.

387
00:22:57,920 --> 00:22:58,920
In the future,

388
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,860
I will become the leader of the Shushan Sect.

389
00:23:05,560 --> 00:23:06,760
I never thought

390
00:23:07,320 --> 00:23:09,400
you would have such ambition.

391
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:10,720
Ambition?

392
00:23:16,310 --> 00:23:18,510
This should have been rightfully mine.

393
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,320
I am your top disciple at Luntian Branch.

394
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,940
My cultivation has progressed greatly.

395
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:26,200
I am the best among all the disciples.

396
00:23:26,600 --> 00:23:27,450
But you?

397
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:28,840
You only care about Mo Xiao.

398
00:23:28,840 --> 00:23:30,700
When have you ever cared about me?

399
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,870
You are...

400
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,960
Didn't expect this, did you?

401
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:51,880
If it weren't for this demonic poison in my body,

402
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:55,320
I wouldn't have been able to draw out the demonic nature in Mo Xiao.

403
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,400
In the end,

404
00:23:56,760 --> 00:23:59,290
I should be thankful for this demonic poison.

405
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:01,740
So...

406
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:05,090
That day at the Sea of Reincarnation, when we were guiding lost souls,

407
00:24:05,090 --> 00:24:08,000
it was you who secretly used the Soul-Cleansing Spell.

408
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:08,800
That's right.

409
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:10,440
It was me.

410
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:14,000
That was a forbidden technique hidden in the Divine Mechanism Hall.

411
00:24:14,000 --> 00:24:15,640
How did you obtain it?

412
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:18,160
Could it be...

413
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:22,780
Could it be that someone has been helping you in secret?

414
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:24,880
Master,

415
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,160
you don't appreciate me,

416
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:29,720
but naturally, there are others who do.

417
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,680
So it's true.

418
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,200
Since when

419
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:40,220
have you been possessed by inner demons?

420
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,080
When?

421
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:46,160
I can't say exactly when it started,

422
00:24:47,480 --> 00:24:48,680
but my hatred for you

423
00:24:49,800 --> 00:24:52,260
began the day Mo Xiao appeared out of nowhere

424
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:55,440
and was appointed as the Young Sect Leader.

425
00:24:57,080 --> 00:25:00,120
You were ultimately controlled by your inner desires,

426
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:01,800
falling into darkness.

427
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,240
Back then in the Love and Desire Valley,

428
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,440
you were infected with demonic poison.

429
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,000
All those infected with demonic poison

430
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:13,800
mostly had their demonic nature resurface,

431
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:15,480
yet you remained unaffected.

432
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,070
I always thought

433
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:20,880
that after years of cultivation under my guidance,

434
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,300
your cultivation would be extraordinary,

435
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:26,900
so you might have completely expelled the demonic influence.

436
00:25:28,160 --> 00:25:29,680
I never imagined

437
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:33,520
that you would fall so deeply into darkness.

438
00:25:34,800 --> 00:25:37,040
You have greatly disappointed me.

439
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:38,720
Master,

440
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:42,280
when have you ever had any expectations of me?

441
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,540
How can you speak of disappointment?

442
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:49,300
You always think I'm biased,

443
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:50,960
favoring one over the other.

444
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,360
But do you know

445
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:55,990
back then,

446
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:58,440
how you came to Shushan Sect?

447
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,000
Back then,

448
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:05,100
you were just a four or five-year-old child,

449
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,160
yet you followed your mother, fleeing from enemies seeking revenge,

450
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,640
wandering as fugitives.

451
00:26:11,880 --> 00:26:15,240
Your mother ultimately didn't want you to spend your life as a fugitive.

452
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:18,020
She climbed Shushan, kowtowing with every step,

453
00:26:18,440 --> 00:26:21,960
and knelt before my Luntian Branch for seven days and seven nights,

454
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:24,020
begging me to take you as my disciple.

455
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,320
I calculated your fate based on your birth time,

456
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:30,000
and found we had no predestined master-disciple relationship.

457
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:32,400
But moved by your mother's maternal love,

458
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,760
I was touched by her,

459
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,250
and decided to accept you as

460
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,360
an inner disciple.

461
00:26:40,360 --> 00:26:42,480
As soon as Mo Xiao appeared,

462
00:26:43,680 --> 00:26:47,140
he inherited the divine sword of the Sword Sovereign Fengyue.

463
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:49,970
I was the head disciple of the Luntian Branch,

464
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,330
yet you only taught me inner cultivation.

465
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,280
Isn't this favoritism?

466
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:06,580
You suffered family misfortunes from a young age,

467
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:10,420
and the killing intent in your heart was too strong.

468
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:13,600
To calm the resentment in your heart,

469
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:15,630
therefore,

470
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:18,160
I only taught you inner cultivation techniques

471
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:20,280
and methods for self-cultivation.

472
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,740
I only wished for you to live a life without killing,

473
00:27:24,060 --> 00:27:26,010
to be an ordinary child.

474
00:27:30,040 --> 00:27:30,760
Ordinary?

475
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,360
No,

476
00:27:33,560 --> 00:27:35,620
I'm not content with being ordinary.

477
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,240
I want to become stronger.

478
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,320
I want everyone to rely on me.

479
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:40,900
I want to become stronger.

480
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:48,600
In the world of cultivation,

481
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,200
there are 84,000 methods.

482
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:55,080
And all these methods,

483
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:57,680
though different paths, lead to the same destination.

484
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,300
Our Immortal Sword sect

485
00:27:59,400 --> 00:28:01,400
requires countless efforts

486
00:28:01,520 --> 00:28:03,320
to obtain a single heart sword.

487
00:28:04,120 --> 00:28:06,520
Yet in the lesson of cultivating the heart,

488
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,400
you are too eager for quick success.

489
00:28:08,400 --> 00:28:10,160
It's difficult to make progress this way.

490
00:28:10,160 --> 00:28:13,560
How can you receive the true teachings of the Immortal Sword?

491
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:15,120
That's right,

492
00:28:15,630 --> 00:28:17,320
I am eager for quick success.

493
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:19,160
I seek shortcuts.

494
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:23,360
Master,

495
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:27,850
if you still care about our master-disciple relationship,

496
00:28:28,460 --> 00:28:30,790
please hand over the Sect Leader's Token.

497
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:33,240
What?

498
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:36,890
You're also looking for the Sect Leader's Token?

499
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:40,280
How do you know I still have it?

500
00:28:44,430 --> 00:28:47,400
The Fengyu Branch has been tracking Mo Xiao all along.

501
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:50,000
The trail went cold on the banks of the Li River.

502
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,080
The end of the Li River.

503
00:28:53,770 --> 00:28:55,490
Could Mo Xiao have gone there?

504
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,560
But the clues brought back by the Fengyu Branch

505
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,760
are enough to confirm

506
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,680
that Mo Xiao doesn't have the Sect Leader's Token.

507
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:08,390
You traced Mo Xiao's last spiritual breath

508
00:29:08,760 --> 00:29:12,030
and confirmed it was at the end of the Li River?

509
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,030
It doesn't matter where Mo Xiao is.

510
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,120
As long as we get the Sect Leader's Token,

511
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:23,360
all the major immortal sects will execute him on sight.

512
00:29:24,760 --> 00:29:26,240
Even if he's still alive,

513
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,900
he won't last more than a few days.

514
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,480
If you don't hand over the Sect Leader's Token,

515
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,610
when the time comes,

516
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:35,160
I'll have no choice but to take you to the Shushan Sect's sword formation.

517
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:37,240
Ten thousand swords will pierce your heart.

518
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:39,440
No matter how deep your cultivation is,

519
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,680
it's inevitable that both your body and soul will perish.

520
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,140
There's no way out either.

521
00:29:45,360 --> 00:29:46,040
What?

522
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:50,520
You want me to go through the Shushan Sect's sword formation?

523
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:51,360
Of course.

524
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,840
If you, Master,

525
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,520
hand over the Sect Leader's Token to me,

526
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,170
I don't want to hurt our master-disciple relationship either.

527
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,280
Fine.

528
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:09,800
I agree to hand over the Sect Leader's Token.

529
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,440
But I want to do it in front of the four Branch Leaders of Shushan Sect

530
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,160
and the leaders of various immortal sects.

531
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:20,800
Alright.

532
00:30:23,160 --> 00:30:25,800
If you dare to hand over the Sect Leader's Token,

533
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,800
then everyone

534
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:30,370
will know it's all my, Lu Jianchuan's, achievement.

535
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,060
Of course, the more people who know, the better.

536
00:30:44,180 --> 00:30:49,640
(Luntian Pavilion)

537
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,640
You've finally come to your senses.
(Luntian Pavilion)

538
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,440
(Luntian Pavilion)

539
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:53,750
You're willing to hand over the Sect Leader's Token.
(Luntian Pavilion)

540
00:30:53,750 --> 00:30:54,800
You're willing to hand over the Sect Leader's Token.

541
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:55,840
Then present it.

542
00:30:57,200 --> 00:30:59,400
I can hand over the Sect Leader's Token,

543
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,840
but I have one condition.

544
00:31:04,730 --> 00:31:07,050
Let Jianchuan come and receive it.

545
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:10,440
We believe

546
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,420
we should still follow the usual procedure.

547
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,240
Now,

548
00:31:14,480 --> 00:31:15,720
Branch Leader Murong

549
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,220
has already been elected by everyone as the Shushan Sect Leader.

550
00:31:18,220 --> 00:31:21,320
This Sect Leader's Token should naturally be handed to him.

551
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,220
That's right.

552
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,680
I'm only here to hand over the token.

553
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,800
I don't care who receives it.

554
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:35,640
It's up to you whether to accept it or not.

555
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,600
Since you have this request,

556
00:31:41,640 --> 00:31:43,000
I'll agree to it.

557
00:31:47,330 --> 00:31:48,280
Jianchuan.

558
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:49,610
Go.

559
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,450
Accept the Sect Leader's Token for me.

560
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:12,240
Master, you still care for me.

561
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:13,960
In a moment, I

562
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,080
will do my best to protect you

563
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:18,820
from the punishment of the sword formation.

564
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:20,800
Thank you.

565
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,240
This...

566
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,410
What's going on?

567
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:34,640
This is... this is...

568
00:32:45,280 --> 00:32:45,800
This...

569
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,370
This is... this is...

570
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:57,770
What...

571
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,520
What's happening?

572
00:33:05,300 --> 00:33:06,730
Yuan Beichen.

573
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:08,400
You lied to me.

574
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,290
Tell me.

575
00:33:13,560 --> 00:33:15,950
Who gave you the Soul-Cleansing Spell?

576
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,620
Who is he really?

577
00:33:29,280 --> 00:33:30,340
Master Changfeng.

578
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:33,140
Master Changfeng, save me!

579
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,540
Master Changfeng, save me!

580
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:37,430
Tell everyone

581
00:33:38,250 --> 00:33:40,810
who's behind all this.

582
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:41,800
Speak.

583
00:34:01,520 --> 00:34:03,900
Lu Jianchuan has been demonized.

584
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,200
Guards!

585
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,480
Arrest Yuan Beichen.

586
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,730
Round up all the disciples

587
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,440
of Luntian Branch.

588
00:34:40,310 --> 00:34:41,590
Yuan Beichen.

589
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:45,260
You have long since fallen into the path of evil.

590
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:48,320
You've been hiding in our Shushan Sect for years.

591
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:51,760
And now,

592
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,770
one of your disciples is a demon child,

593
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,540
and another has fallen into the path of evil.

594
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:02,640
Who knows how many disciples in your Luntian Branch

595
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:06,090
have already been corrupted by your demonic influence?

596
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:09,720
If you refuse to hand over the Sect Leader's Token today,

597
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:11,400
then I'll make your disciples

598
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:14,360
enter this sword formation one by one with you

599
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:16,720
to verify whether they have demonic hearts.

600
00:35:16,720 --> 00:35:17,480
Senior,

601
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:18,960
do you

602
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:22,210
intend to wipe out the entire Luntian Branch?

603
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,110
Junior,

604
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:29,840
the Shushan Sect is in grave danger now.

605
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:33,320
I would rather make the mistake of killing the innocent

606
00:35:33,320 --> 00:35:34,850
than let the guilty go free.

607
00:35:35,360 --> 00:35:39,240
Although Lu Jianchuan is the senior disciple of our Luntian Branch,

608
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,140
the Soul-Cleansing Spell

609
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,840
has always been kept in the Divine Mechanism Hall,

610
00:35:43,840 --> 00:35:46,640
in the side hall managed by your Fengyu Branch.

611
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,120
He secretly practiced our Shushan Sect's forbidden techniques.

612
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:54,200
He must have received covert assistance from certain individuals.

613
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:56,140
The real threat to our Shushan Sect

614
00:35:56,280 --> 00:35:58,440
is precisely those who aided him in secret.

615
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,200
Who exactly is this person?

616
00:36:00,840 --> 00:36:01,560
Indeed.

617
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,180
Senior Murong,

618
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,780
that Soul-Cleansing Spell,

619
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:05,800
hasn't it always been

620
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,600
under the control of your Fengyu Branch?

621
00:36:07,600 --> 00:36:09,860
How did it end up in Lu Jianchuan's hands?

622
00:36:11,840 --> 00:36:12,520
Junior,

623
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:14,980
esteemed Immortal Lords,

624
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,000
this Yuan Beichen

625
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,680
is the head of the four branch leaders of Shushan Sect,

626
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:21,080
and has been in the position of Sect Leader for many years.

627
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:24,000
If his senior disciple wanted to enter my Divine Mechanism Hall,

628
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:25,530
who could have stopped him?

629
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:27,360
Yuan Beichen,

630
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,200
at this point,

631
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:33,320
you're still here making false accusations and shifting blame.

632
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,960
The Sect Leader's Token,

633
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,540
are you going to hand it over today or not?

634
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:50,540
I, Yuan Beichen,

635
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,360
have been blind to the truth,

636
00:36:52,380 --> 00:36:54,320
unable to distinguish between right and wrong,

637
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:56,920
failing the trust of the immortal sects.

638
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,320
Today,

639
00:37:06,320 --> 00:37:08,040
I will gouge out my own eyes,

640
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:12,250
destroy my spiritual essence,

641
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
and confess my sins to Shushan Sect.

642
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,570
My fault

643
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,760
shall be paid with my life.

644
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:28,760
I only ask Junior Xuan Zhen

645
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,960
to keep my eyeballs.

646
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:37,640
After I die,

647
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:41,360
let me see this world again

648
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,100
to determine if it returns to righteousness

649
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:46,960
or succumbs to evil.

650
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:04,720
No!

651
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:44,520
Senior!

652
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:06,480
Senior!

653
00:39:07,620 --> 00:39:09,090
(Sword Pavilion)

654
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:12,200
Senior!

655
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,640
Senior!

656
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,520
Senior!

657
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:30,960
Senior!

658
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:13,890
Young master,

659
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:15,930
you've come to our fishing village.

660
00:40:15,930 --> 00:40:18,170
It seems you were destined to be here.

661
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:19,240
Now,

662
00:40:19,320 --> 00:40:21,380
we'll offer you to the River God.

663
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:22,570
May the River God

664
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:24,160
bless your journey to the afterlife.

665
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:28,600
May the River God bless your journey to the afterlife.

666
00:40:46,880 --> 00:40:47,720
Second Brother,

667
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:49,870
has he... has he become a ghost?

668
00:40:50,120 --> 00:40:51,020
Everyone, be careful!

669
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:52,500
That's an evil force.

670
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:53,840
What should we do?

671
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:55,100
what should we do?

672
00:40:56,280 --> 00:40:57,860
What era are we living in?

673
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,880
You're still doing this water burial nonsense.

674
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:02,810
The person wasn't dead, but you almost drowned them.

675
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,340
Yesterday at Li River,

676
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,320
you all saw it, didn't you?

677
00:41:19,320 --> 00:41:20,160
Yes, we did.

678
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:21,840
That person turned into such a state.

679
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,170
This is an ominous sign.

680
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:26,040
Our fishing village has always lived in seclusion,

681
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:27,520
avoiding contact with the outside world.

682
00:41:27,520 --> 00:41:29,150
Suddenly, this inauspicious person appears.

683
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:30,680
Who knows if it's a blessing or a curse?

684
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,480
Indeed.

685
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:32,160
Ms. Jin.

686
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,840
Who was that person who saved him?

687
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:34,810
I don't know.

688
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,520
Maybe we should inform the Chief.

689
00:41:38,320 --> 00:41:40,570
You know the Chief's temper.

690
00:41:40,840 --> 00:41:42,170
Let's discuss it later.

691
00:41:55,710 --> 00:41:57,320
Still not awake?

692
00:42:05,170 --> 00:42:08,030
My Core Replenishing Pill has never failed before.

693
00:42:09,920 --> 00:42:10,480
This won't do.

694
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:11,440
I have to try again.
