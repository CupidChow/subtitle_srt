(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,680
(Episode 21)

3
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:55,750
Lixue!

4
00:02:17,210 --> 00:02:17,980
Mo Xiao.

5
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:20,450
Mo Xiao?

6
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,850
Star Lord Lixue,

7
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,410
you've actually colluded with a disciple from the Shushan Sect,

8
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:41,560
broken into our sect's forbidden area,

9
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,780
and destroyed our sacred artifact, the Suyu Cauldron.

10
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:45,510
Such a betrayal and defection from the sect—

11
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:47,050
I'm afraid that even the Demon Lord

12
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:49,180
won't be able to protect you this time.

13
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,740
You dare to intrude into our sect's Ancestral Hall with an outsider.

14
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,370
Destroying our sect's sacred artifact

15
00:02:55,370 --> 00:02:56,600
is a capital offense!

16
00:02:57,720 --> 00:02:59,190
Seize these two!

17
00:03:23,930 --> 00:03:24,880
Mo Xiao!

18
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,420
Lixue.

19
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:08,880
Lixue.

20
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:42,820
He actually managed to set up a barrier in our Ancestral Hall?

21
00:04:42,820 --> 00:04:44,120
How is that possible?

22
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,290
Who is he really?

23
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:53,540
Lixue.

24
00:04:53,990 --> 00:04:55,370
How many times have I told you

25
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,750
not to recklessly use the Ice Technique?

26
00:04:56,750 --> 00:04:58,150
You'll suffer backlash.

27
00:04:58,780 --> 00:04:59,300
Lixue.

28
00:05:01,830 --> 00:05:02,440
Lixue?

29
00:05:03,690 --> 00:05:04,620
Lixue.

30
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,310
Do you know why your embrace

31
00:05:16,480 --> 00:05:19,410
works better on this girl than your spiritual power?

32
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:21,620
The key is your blood.

33
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:25,070
Your blood is the cure for her cold condition.

34
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:29,630
If one day the cold energy invades her bones

35
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,990
and threatens her life,

36
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:33,960
you might try to transfer your blood to her.

37
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:36,920
Transfer my blood...

38
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:00,790
Supreme Lord.

39
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,900
Since I've already saved you,

40
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:27,430
why did you come back?

41
00:06:27,830 --> 00:06:28,950
I told you...

42
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,410
no one

43
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:33,630
except me can kill you.

44
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:35,850
You can't die here.

45
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:39,230
Lixue.

46
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:44,159
Mo Xiao!

47
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,770
You dare to set a barrier within the Ancestral Hall of our sect.

48
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:49,970
You think our sect has no capable people?

49
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:51,510
Let's attack together.

50
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:53,040
I don't believe we cannot destroy

51
00:06:53,040 --> 00:06:55,480
a barrier set by an outsider's technique.

52
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,680
Since they won't come out

53
00:06:58,700 --> 00:07:00,080
and won't let us in,

54
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,670
that's fine.

55
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,990
Leave their lives here as a sacrifice

56
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:07,730
to the Heavenly Demon Spirits of our clan.

57
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:19,680
Lixue.

58
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:54,050
Jing,

59
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:55,550
if we try to force our way through

60
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:56,790
this maze formation,

61
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,940
we definitely won't be able to get out.

62
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:00,340
So I specially made this.

63
00:08:01,170 --> 00:08:02,070
Bamboo dragonfly?

64
00:08:02,070 --> 00:08:02,870
That's right.

65
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:04,810
The bamboo dragonfly I made is no ordinary one.

66
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,150
It can discern directions and guide the way.

67
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:07,950
Let's see if it can lead us out.

68
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:24,510
You...

69
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,850
are very good at making bamboo dragonflies?

70
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:27,930
Of course.

71
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:28,980
It was the very first

72
00:08:28,980 --> 00:08:30,690
mechanical artifact I learned to make as a child.

73
00:08:30,690 --> 00:08:32,020
I'm quite skilled at it.

74
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:37,190
Then... does Mo Xiao know how to make them?

75
00:08:37,559 --> 00:08:38,980
Of course not.

76
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,419
When it comes to sword flying,

77
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,049
then sure, he's better than I am.

78
00:08:42,049 --> 00:08:44,039
But when it comes to making mechanical artifacts,

79
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,020
if I, Xie Lingyun, claim to be second in the Shushan Sect,

80
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:47,950
no one would dare claim to be first.

81
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:51,040
Why didn't you say so earlier?

82
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,200
What's there to brag about?

83
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,380
It's just a bamboo dragonfly.

84
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,680
I know a lot more than that.

85
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:55,440
Don't worry.

86
00:08:55,470 --> 00:08:56,330
Let me go check.

the one who saved me on the back mountain

111
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:09,010
was actually you.

112
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,830
All these years,

113
00:10:12,620 --> 00:10:14,250
I've mistakenly thought

114
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,360
it was Mo Xiao from Xuanqing Court.

Lingyun.

00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,560
just fainted.

170

171
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,770
just give us a quick end.

172
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:50,320

00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:51,400
What exactly are you planning?

174
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,460
If you want to live,

175
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,760
stay put and behave yourself.

176
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,230
Xie Lingyun.

177
00:12:22,610 --> 00:12:23,210
Ce.

178
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:24,760
Ce.

179
00:12:26,030 --> 00:12:26,780
Father.

180
00:12:26,900 --> 00:12:27,710
Master Xie.

181
00:12:28,220 --> 00:12:29,020
Ce.

182
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:31,810
Now that the demonic miasma has been cleared,

183
00:12:31,810 --> 00:12:34,390
hurry and arrange for everyone to leave the valley,

184
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:36,260
just in case anything else happens.

185
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:37,000
Father,

186
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,100
everyone has already been safely escorted out of the city.

187
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,340
As of now, only

188
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,280
our Shushan disciples remain in the valley.

189
00:12:42,280 --> 00:12:43,270
That's good.

190
00:12:43,690 --> 00:12:44,710
Where's Lingyun?

191
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:46,670
Why haven't I seen that boy around?

192
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,300
Branch Leaders,

193
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,400
Young Master Xie and Junior Jing...

194
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:53,130
have already broken out of the valley.

195
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,620
What do you mean?

196
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:55,710
Where did they go?

197
00:12:56,570 --> 00:12:57,240
Father.

198
00:12:57,580 --> 00:12:59,110
Jing stole my Jade Rhinoceros Scarf

199
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:00,820
and snuck away with Junior Xie.

200
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:01,590
I guess

201
00:13:01,690 --> 00:13:03,080
they've gone to Mount Suyu.

202
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,380
The miasma has cleared.

203
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:05,870
Looks like they've succeeded.

204
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:07,460
Oh my goodness.

205
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:09,560
They went to Mount Suyu?

206
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:12,290
This brat is way too reckless!

207
00:13:12,620 --> 00:13:14,060
He even dragged Jing along.

208
00:13:14,060 --> 00:13:15,590
If anything happens to them

209
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:17,060
or they encounter any danger,

210
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,900
how can I face you, Senior Murong?

211
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,820
Alright, Junior Xie,

212
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,020
calm down.

213
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:22,880
Since the poisonous miasma here has been dispelled,

214
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,380
it means that the great battle on Mount Suyu

215
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:25,840
must've ended in victory.

216
00:13:26,750 --> 00:13:29,510
If Jing and Lingyun really went up there,

217
00:13:29,820 --> 00:13:31,710
they might run into the Sect Leader

218
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:33,170
and the Young Sect Leader.

219
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:34,960
They should be fine.

220
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:36,570
Regardless of whether anything happens or not,

221
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:39,230
he won't escape a good whipping when he returns.

222
00:13:39,350 --> 00:13:41,880
The Young Sect Leader also went to Mount Suyu?

223
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:06,670
Am I dead?

224
00:14:07,080 --> 00:14:08,890
You just woke up, and you're already talking nonsense.

225
00:14:08,890 --> 00:14:11,310
What's all this talk about being dead or not?

226
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,310
I'm not dead.

227
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:13,990
Then why are you crying?

228
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,700
I'm not crying.

229
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,970
I just got some pollen in my eyes from outside.

230
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,170
Let me blow it away for you then.

231
00:14:22,590 --> 00:14:24,590
You'd better take care of yourself first.

232
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,600
You, the great Young Master of the Tielyv Branch—

233
00:14:26,600 --> 00:14:28,710
taken down after just one move.

234
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:30,180
How impressive indeed.

235
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:31,960
I was just worried about you!

236
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:33,170
If I hadn't been so distracted by you,

237
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:35,830
how could I have let that shadow sneak attack me?

238
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:37,800
That man said

239
00:14:37,820 --> 00:14:39,480
there are mazes all around us.

240
00:14:39,710 --> 00:14:42,110
Even the great immortals couldn't escape.

241
00:14:42,310 --> 00:14:43,390
Will we

242
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,090
starve to death here?

243
00:14:50,770 --> 00:14:51,800
Hey, you two!

244
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:53,380
Did the Demon Lord send you here?

245
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,940
Why is he keeping us here?

246
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,220
Come on, say something, you two!

247
00:15:00,220 --> 00:15:01,310
What does this mean?

248
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,510
Is this our last meal?

249
00:15:02,530 --> 00:15:05,060
How can we eat if you don't explain this means?

250
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:08,880
I think these two must be mute.

251
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,030
Alright.

252
00:15:11,050 --> 00:15:11,850
Ignore them.

253
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:12,900
Let's eat.

254
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,450
Now that the Suyu Cauldron has been destroyed,

255
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:29,680
yet there's still no sign of the Sect Leader, the Young Sect Leader,

256
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,860
Young Master Jing, or Young Master Xie.

257
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:34,790
Could something have happened to them on Mount Suyu?

258
00:15:40,140 --> 00:15:42,120
Branch Leaders, please allow us, the Three Guardians,

259
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:44,510
to go to the foot of Mount Suyu to investigate.

260
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:45,200
Well...

261
00:15:46,920 --> 00:15:48,040
Senior Murong.

262
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:50,330
Why don't we go there and check?

263
00:15:51,140 --> 00:15:51,780
Alright.

264
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:53,130
Report!

265
00:15:55,250 --> 00:15:57,820
The Sect Leader... the Sect Leader has returned!

266
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,820
Hurry, go see him.

267
00:16:06,460 --> 00:16:07,470
Sect Leader!

268
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,520
-Hurry and help your master in.
-Hurry!

269
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:26,130
Lixue.

270
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:28,570
Lixue!

271
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:30,300
Mo Xiao.

272
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:32,780
Mo Xiao.

273
00:16:34,450 --> 00:16:35,410
Mo Xiao.

274
00:16:38,860 --> 00:16:40,540
Lixue, Lixue.

275
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:42,770
Are you alright?

276
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:44,140
Are you hurt?

277
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,350
I believe you now.

278
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,200
What?

279
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,680
About my father's fall from the cliff back then...

280
00:16:53,730 --> 00:16:54,810
I believe you

281
00:16:55,520 --> 00:16:57,850
that perhaps there's more to this matter.

282
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,790
I came to save you today

283
00:17:00,390 --> 00:17:02,770
because I need to keep you alive

284
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,780
until I figure out what really happened.

285
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:07,010
You can't die.

286
00:17:08,190 --> 00:17:09,650
But if you've lied to me...

287
00:17:12,470 --> 00:17:14,150
I'll still kill you.

288
00:17:18,630 --> 00:17:19,190
Okay.

289
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,650
I'll keep

290
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:24,030
this life of mine for you.

291
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:38,190
Supreme Lord,

292
00:17:38,380 --> 00:17:39,710
are you feeling better?

293
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:49,630
How's the situation at the Ancestral Hall?

294
00:17:49,630 --> 00:17:51,230
Minghuang and the others...

295
00:17:51,310 --> 00:17:53,440
have opened the Heavenly Demon Abyss.

296
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:56,880
What about Feng Lixue?

297
00:17:58,020 --> 00:17:58,660
She...

298
00:17:59,450 --> 00:18:01,770
fell into the Heavenly Demon Abyss alongside Mo Xiao.

299
00:18:01,770 --> 00:18:02,710
What?

300
00:18:04,030 --> 00:18:04,830
Supreme Lord!

301
00:18:06,090 --> 00:18:07,590
Why didn't you stop them?

302
00:18:07,610 --> 00:18:08,410
Supreme Lord,

303
00:18:08,430 --> 00:18:10,030
Lixue has already practiced

304
00:18:10,040 --> 00:18:11,480
the Ice Technique that Mo Xiao taught her.

305
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:12,520
It has started to interfere with

306
00:18:12,520 --> 00:18:16,750
the spiritual energy of the Ice Blue Moth, causing backlash to you, Supreme Lord.

307
00:18:16,750 --> 00:18:18,000
For me,

308
00:18:18,230 --> 00:18:20,890
nothing is more important than protecting you.

309
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,460
You know full well

310
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,500
how important the two of them are to my plan.

311
00:18:24,500 --> 00:18:25,300
Supreme Lord.

312
00:18:26,340 --> 00:18:27,640
Mo Xiao has now destroyed

313
00:18:27,640 --> 00:18:29,300
the sacred artifact, the Suyu Cauldron of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

314
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:30,420
He has committed a grave taboo.

315
00:18:30,420 --> 00:18:32,070
Not to mention the two Star Lords,

316
00:18:32,070 --> 00:18:35,070
even the entire Heavenly Demon Clan won't let him off.

317
00:18:36,530 --> 00:18:37,910
And Lixue, at this moment,

318
00:18:37,910 --> 00:18:39,060
in front of everyone,

319
00:18:39,060 --> 00:18:40,920
rescued Mo Xiao from the Ancestral Hall.

320
00:18:40,920 --> 00:18:44,120
Those two have become targets of the Heavenly Demon Clan.

321
00:18:44,490 --> 00:18:45,290
Supreme Lord,

322
00:18:45,430 --> 00:18:47,410
if you still try to protect her at this point,

323
00:18:47,410 --> 00:18:49,270
our entire plan might be exposed.

324
00:18:49,610 --> 00:18:50,540
Supreme Lord,

325
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,170
please reconsider.

326
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,220
Lixue...

327
00:18:56,030 --> 00:18:59,090
absolutely cannot remain in the Heavenly Demon Abyss.

328
00:19:16,870 --> 00:19:18,270
Heavenly Demon Spirits?

329
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:25,720
That's right.

330
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:31,990
These beings are extremely bizarre.

331
00:19:31,990 --> 00:19:33,820
They live by feeding on people's spiritual power.

332
00:19:33,820 --> 00:19:35,050
If they are awakened,

333
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:37,680
no matter how high one's spiritual power may be, it will be completely consumed.

334
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:38,390
Be careful.

335
00:19:54,180 --> 00:19:54,780
Watch out!

336
00:20:18,890 --> 00:20:19,450
Lixue.

337
00:20:28,720 --> 00:20:29,490
Who are you?

338
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:30,500
And who are you?

339
00:20:30,950 --> 00:20:32,260
I am Mo Xiao, a disciple of

340
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:33,260
the Shushan Sect.

341
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:34,240
Shushan Sect?

342
00:20:34,810 --> 00:20:37,470
You're actually a disciple of the Shushan Sect?

343
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,610
That's impossible.

344
00:20:40,780 --> 00:20:41,910
It can't be.

345
00:20:43,930 --> 00:20:44,890
Mo Xiao.

346
00:20:47,910 --> 00:20:48,810
Master?

347
00:20:49,110 --> 00:20:49,850
Come with me.

348
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:50,780
But Mo Xiao, he...

349
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:51,460
Shut up.

350
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,640
Who are you really?

351
00:21:05,330 --> 00:21:06,070
Senior,

352
00:21:06,710 --> 00:21:08,930
I am Mo Xiao, a disciple of the Shushan Sect.

353
00:21:08,930 --> 00:21:10,060
May I ask who you are?

354
00:21:10,330 --> 00:21:10,890
No,

355
00:21:10,950 --> 00:21:13,280
you are not a disciple of the Shushan Sect.

356
00:21:14,260 --> 00:21:15,540
None of this here

357
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,610
can hurt you.

358
00:21:17,970 --> 00:21:19,450
What do you mean, Senior?

359
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:21,020
Heavenly Demon Spirits.

360
00:21:21,170 --> 00:21:23,900
It must be the call of the Heavenly Demon Spirits.

361
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:30,560
You should go.

362
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:33,570
Senior,

363
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:34,670
let me take you with me.

364
00:21:34,670 --> 00:21:35,150
No.

365
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:38,380
When you have completed what you need to do,

366
00:21:38,710 --> 00:21:40,150
you will come back here.

367
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,760
I will be here,

368
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,440
waiting for your return.

369
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:02,260
What are you thinking about?

370
00:22:02,260 --> 00:22:03,120
Aren't you hungry?

371
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,030
Hurry up and eat.

372
00:22:04,030 --> 00:22:04,960
These dishes are really good.

373
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,070
I've already tasted them for you.

374
00:22:06,070 --> 00:22:08,470
I guarantee they're safe and not poisoned.

375
00:22:15,190 --> 00:22:16,830
What's the deal with you two?

376
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,570
You've been watching us all this time.

377
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:20,370
Treating us with such good food.

378
00:22:20,790 --> 00:22:21,990
Are you trying to win us over

379
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:23,850
to join your Heavenly Demon Sect?

380
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,000
These two must be mute.

381
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:30,840
Eat, Jing.

382
00:22:30,870 --> 00:22:33,130
The food will go to waste if you don't eat.

383
00:22:35,970 --> 00:22:36,900
Clear the table.

384
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:39,520
Hold on.

385
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,890
This soup is quite tasty. I'll have another sip.

386
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,080
Another sip?

387
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:44,710
Aren't you afraid of bursting your stomach?

388
00:22:47,710 --> 00:22:49,070
Fine, I won't drink then.

389
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:50,390
Why did you hit me?

390
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:51,660
That really hurts.

391
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,700
My hand is all red.

392
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
Did you discover something?

393
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,470
Do you want to escape from this courtyard?

394
00:23:15,470 --> 00:23:16,320
You have a way?

395
00:23:16,630 --> 00:23:17,790
Of course, I do.

396
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:20,310
Great.

397
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,210
We finally made it out.

398
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:22,240
I'm impressive, aren't I?

399
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:22,860
Impressive.

400
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:23,980
I'm sincerely convinced

401
00:24:23,980 --> 00:24:25,510
and thoroughly impressed.

402
00:24:25,830 --> 00:24:26,550
Let's go.

403
00:24:33,870 --> 00:24:34,670
This way.

404
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:45,680
Be careful.

405
00:24:46,660 --> 00:24:47,760
Well,

406
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:49,970
if these two Star Lords are really going to clash with the Supreme Lord,

407
00:24:49,970 --> 00:24:51,120
whose orders should we follow?

408
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:52,300
Of course, we should follow the Supreme Lord's orders.

409
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,480
He is the highest authority, after all.

410
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:55,730
But he is not one of our Heavenly Demon Clan.

411
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:57,320
His disciple and that Shushan Sect disciple

412
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:58,620
were both trapped in the Heavenly Demon Abyss,

413
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:01,360
yet the Supreme Lord only rescued his disciple, Feng Lixue.

414
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:04,530
He doesn't seem to care at all about our clan's sacred artifact being destroyed.

415
00:25:04,530 --> 00:25:05,250
You tell me,

416
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:07,730
does he still seem like a Supreme Lord to you?

417
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,280
Could it be that the two Star Lords

418
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,440
can really remove the Supreme Lord from his position?

419
00:25:12,440 --> 00:25:15,300
But there's never been such a precedent in our sect.

420
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:17,540
Even if they can't strip him of his title,

421
00:25:17,540 --> 00:25:19,080
his disciple's position as the Star Lord of Shaohao

422
00:25:19,080 --> 00:25:20,470
will definitely be in jeopardy.

423
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:21,430
What are you doing?

424
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:22,560
Hurry up and keep up!

425
00:25:23,020 --> 00:25:23,690
Coming, coming.

426
00:25:23,690 --> 00:25:24,750
Let's go, let's go.

427
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:27,940
Is that the Shushan Sect disciple they mentioned,

428
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,120
Mo Xiao?

429
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:31,470
Who else could it be?

430
00:25:31,880 --> 00:25:32,760
Then, Mo Xiao

431
00:25:32,790 --> 00:25:34,670
must be trapped in the Heavenly Demon Abyss.

432
00:25:34,670 --> 00:25:35,500
Where is the Heavenly Demon Abyss?

433
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,830
We need to go rescue him.

434
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,380
If the map is correct,

435
00:25:39,410 --> 00:25:42,180
it should be beneath the Demon Sect's Ancestral Hall.

436
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,840
Where is that Ancestral Hall?

437
00:25:43,890 --> 00:25:44,950
Let's follow them.

438
00:26:06,090 --> 00:26:07,020
Drink this.

439
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,590
When you returned from Tongming Island,

440
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:23,960
I told you

441
00:26:24,390 --> 00:26:27,160
that the Ice Technique is a mental cultivation method of the Shushan Sect,

442
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:29,280
and it conflicts with your inner energy.

443
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,680
If you force yourself to use it,

444
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,210
the two powers will collide within your body,

445
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:35,560
which your body simply cannot withstand.

446
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,960
You must not use it again.

447
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:39,640
Why didn't you listen?

448
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,010
The situation was dire.

449
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,760
I had no other choice.

450
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,280
Fortunately, you have me by your side.

451
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:50,340
Drink the medicinal wine,

452
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,560
and you'll recover quickly.

453
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,200
What's wrong?

454
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:03,720
Master,

455
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:05,870
I've almost fully recovered.

456
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,500
I don't need it this time.

457
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,860
In that case...

458
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,780
you don't need me anymore either.

459
00:27:23,660 --> 00:27:24,380
Master,

460
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,360
Mo Xiao is still trapped in the Heavenly Demon Abyss.

461
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,420
We can't just stand by and do nothing.

462
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:31,520
And what do you want to do about it?

463
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,850
Master, you promised me

464
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:34,720
to use Mo Xiao to complete the plan,

465
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:36,650
while Mo Xiao's life belongs to me.

466
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:39,810
I did say that.

467
00:27:40,730 --> 00:27:42,060
So before that happens,

468
00:27:42,220 --> 00:27:44,280
I won't allow anyone else to kill him.

469
00:27:53,690 --> 00:27:54,490
What if...

470
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,560
I want to kill him?

471
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,010
Zisu.

472
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,110
How is the Sect Leader's injury?

473
00:28:47,110 --> 00:28:48,520
The Sect Leader was wounded in the chest.

474
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:51,100
Fortunately, the blade was off by a bit and missed his vital organs.

475
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,780
However, he lost a lot of blood, and his vitality is severely damaged,

476
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,840
which is why he remains unconscious.

477
00:28:56,900 --> 00:28:57,570
Father.

478
00:28:58,450 --> 00:28:59,640
The matters in Love and Desire Valley

479
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,870
have been mostly taken care of.

480
00:29:00,870 --> 00:29:03,650
All the various sects from the martial arts world have left one after another.

481
00:29:03,650 --> 00:29:06,250
Now that the Sect Leader is seriously injured,

482
00:29:06,410 --> 00:29:07,840
why don't you and Master Xie

483
00:29:07,840 --> 00:29:09,920
take him back to Shushan to recover first?

484
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,450
I'll stay here and wait for news

485
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:13,310
of the Young Sect Leader and Jing.

486
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:14,880
Then you stay here.

487
00:29:15,010 --> 00:29:16,870
I'll escort the Sect Leader back to Shushan first.

488
00:29:16,870 --> 00:29:17,820
If anything happens,

489
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,420
remember,

490
00:29:18,790 --> 00:29:20,860
you must send me a message through the Fengyu Soundlink immediately.

491
00:29:20,860 --> 00:29:21,570
Yes, Father.

492
00:29:21,570 --> 00:29:22,170
Master,

493
00:29:22,350 --> 00:29:24,390
we are the Young Sect Leader's guardians.

494
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:25,270
We also want to stay here

495
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:27,860
and wait for him, Young Master Jing, and Young Master Xie.

496
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,660
Alright then.

497
00:29:29,420 --> 00:29:31,080
Then you stay here with Ce.

498
00:29:32,600 --> 00:29:33,260
Jianchuan.

499
00:29:33,980 --> 00:29:35,310
Your master is injured

500
00:29:35,330 --> 00:29:36,600
and needs someone by his side.

501
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,400
You come back to Shushan with us.

502
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:40,130
Understood, Master Changfeng.

503
00:29:40,130 --> 00:29:41,340
Those of you who stay

504
00:29:41,370 --> 00:29:42,740
must be extra careful.

505
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:44,320
Yes, Master Changfeng.

506
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:54,420
Mother.

507
00:29:55,130 --> 00:29:57,190
How are things at the Ancestral Hall?

508
00:29:58,180 --> 00:30:00,580
You want to ask about Feng Lixue, don't you?

509
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:03,400
You ordered me to wait in the palace and not go there,

510
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,250
but I was still very worried.

511
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,180
Were you worried about me

512
00:30:09,670 --> 00:30:11,510
or about that Feng Lixue?

513
00:30:11,530 --> 00:30:13,460
Of course, I was worried about you.

514
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:15,740
But...

515
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:17,710
is Lixue alright?

516
00:30:25,220 --> 00:30:26,060
Mother,

517
00:30:26,370 --> 00:30:27,670
for all these years,

518
00:30:27,700 --> 00:30:29,230
you've been in poor health.

519
00:30:29,880 --> 00:30:30,940
You live alone in Yaoling Palace

520
00:30:30,940 --> 00:30:32,740
to avoid the affairs of the sect.

521
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:35,580
Why have you suddenly become concerned about these matters?

522
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,700
I think

523
00:30:36,730 --> 00:30:38,760
you should still take care of your health.

524
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:41,880
Do you remember why you and I live alone in Yaoling Palace,

525
00:30:41,880 --> 00:30:43,410
never involving ourselves

526
00:30:44,430 --> 00:30:45,520
in sect matters?

527
00:30:46,510 --> 00:30:48,930
Naturally, it's to avoid Chongguang's spies

528
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:51,730
while secretly searching for my missing brother.

529
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:53,710
Back then,

530
00:30:54,630 --> 00:30:56,660
I lost both my husband and my son,

531
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:58,310
and I was unable to find solace for a long time.

532
00:30:58,310 --> 00:31:00,640
I returned to the Lishui River in despair.

533
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:03,490
There, by sheer fate, I found you by the river,

534
00:31:03,750 --> 00:31:05,370
barely breathing.

535
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:10,940
I brought you back to Mount Suyu and took you in as my adopted son.

536
00:31:14,030 --> 00:31:15,200
When you were 8,

537
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:17,430
I took you to the Ancestral Hall

538
00:31:17,630 --> 00:31:21,320
and made you the youngest Guardian Star Envoy of the Ancestral Hall.

539
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:22,400
Do you know why?

540
00:31:24,550 --> 00:31:27,200
It was for me to search through all the ancient texts

541
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,930
to find the technique of bloodline communion...

542
00:31:29,990 --> 00:31:31,490
hoping that one day...

543
00:31:33,130 --> 00:31:35,090
we could find my missing brother,

544
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:38,520
the true Demon Lord bloodline of the Heavenly Demon Clan.

545
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,070
Very good.

546
00:31:42,890 --> 00:31:44,290
You still remember that.

547
00:31:49,550 --> 00:31:50,670
It's been 18 years.

548
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,310
If my child is still in this world,

549
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,000
he'll certainly be

550
00:31:58,900 --> 00:32:02,560
about the same age as the Young Sect Leader of the Shushan Sect now.

551
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:05,670
18 years is really too long.

552
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:08,850
I really can't wait any longer.

553
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:54,960
Do you still remember...

554
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:58,100
when you first came to Mang Mountain,

555
00:32:58,960 --> 00:33:00,360
what I always did first

556
00:33:01,820 --> 00:33:03,460
whenever I visited you?

557
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:42,740
As a girl grows up,

558
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:44,910
the first thing she needs to learn

559
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:46,550
is how to pin up her own hair.

560
00:33:53,380 --> 00:33:55,210
The first thing I learned

561
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,960
was how to pin up my own hair.

562
00:33:59,290 --> 00:34:01,220
You were the one who taught me how to

563
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,950
pin up my hair for the first time, Master.

564
00:34:06,010 --> 00:34:07,970
I love beautiful things.

565
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,630
In this world,

566
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:13,610
the years stretch far too long.

567
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:15,989
If what meets the eye...

568
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:19,139
is not beautiful enough...

569
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,530
then it might as well be destroyed.

570
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:31,560
Lixue.

571
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,239
I will cultivate tonight.

572
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,500
You stand watch for me.

573
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:38,409
Master,

574
00:34:38,850 --> 00:34:41,850
could Chang Ming stand watch for you tonight instead?

575
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,030
What?

576
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:45,969
Are you refusing me?

577
00:34:47,380 --> 00:34:48,780
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

578
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,860
I want to return to the palace to rest.

579
00:34:59,750 --> 00:35:02,430
Are you still... my Lixue?

580
00:35:04,120 --> 00:35:06,870
Master, you will always be my master.

581
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:11,180
Excellent.

582
00:35:12,830 --> 00:35:14,230
A most excellent answer.

583
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:18,740
But you must remember,

584
00:35:20,000 --> 00:35:20,760
you and I

585
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,620
are not just simply master and disciple.

586
00:35:25,890 --> 00:35:27,570
We are one.

587
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,700
You

588
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:33,520
will forever

589
00:35:34,440 --> 00:35:35,360
and ever

590
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,370
be my Lixue.

591
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,360
This should be the place.

592
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:22,070
We won't be wrong this time, right?

593
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,300
We shouldn't be.

594
00:36:26,160 --> 00:36:27,430
We've tried all the wrong ones.

595
00:36:27,430 --> 00:36:28,210
If we're wrong again,

596
00:36:28,210 --> 00:36:30,010
it can only mean the map is wrong.

597
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:31,820
You've got a lot of nerve saying that.

598
00:36:31,820 --> 00:36:33,290
If you hadn't been such a pig-headed fool,

599
00:36:33,290 --> 00:36:35,270
we wouldn't have had to crawl through hole after hole.

600
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,150
Alright,

601
00:36:36,190 --> 00:36:37,190
let's hurry down.

602
00:36:37,980 --> 00:36:38,610
I...

603
00:36:39,940 --> 00:36:41,340
You go first.

604
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:43,840
Then stay close behind me.

605
00:36:58,380 --> 00:37:00,320
Seal all exits from the dungeon.

606
00:37:00,350 --> 00:37:01,990
We must not let them escape.

607
00:37:02,010 --> 00:37:02,560
Chase them!

608
00:37:02,560 --> 00:37:03,760
-Yes, sir!
-Yes, sir!

609
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:21,730
Jing?

610
00:37:22,190 --> 00:37:22,990
What's wrong?

611
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:26,190
I've been struck by Minghuang's Lotus Thorn.

612
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:29,480
Jing,

613
00:37:29,610 --> 00:37:30,620
hang in there.

614
00:37:30,650 --> 00:37:32,490
We'll definitely get out of here.

615
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:32,950
Come on.

616
00:37:39,110 --> 00:37:40,640
You should rest for a while.

617
00:38:02,010 --> 00:38:02,900
Mo Xiao?

618
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:05,820
Mo Xiao.

619
00:38:06,300 --> 00:38:07,230
It really is you.

620
00:38:07,390 --> 00:38:08,590
How did you end up here?

621
00:38:08,590 --> 00:38:10,290
I heard that you were in danger in the Heavenly Demon Abyss

622
00:38:10,290 --> 00:38:11,400
and was about to go rescue you.

623
00:38:11,400 --> 00:38:12,300
Are you alright?

624
00:38:12,300 --> 00:38:12,900
I'm fine.

625
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:14,090
By the way,

626
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,190
why are you here?

627
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,230
Where are Master and the others?

628
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:17,260
How's the Love and Desire Valley?

629
00:38:17,260 --> 00:38:19,000
We originally planned to destroy the Suyu Cauldron,

630
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:21,040
but you'd already broken it before we even found it.

631
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:22,200
Later, I heard from the demon soldiers

632
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,540
that you were in danger in the Heavenly Demon Abyss.

633
00:38:23,540 --> 00:38:25,070
So I decided to come rescue you.

634
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:26,570
Since you've broken the Mount Suyu Cauldron,

635
00:38:26,570 --> 00:38:27,830
the people in Love and Desire Valley should be safe now.

636
00:38:27,830 --> 00:38:28,630
Master and the others

637
00:38:28,630 --> 00:38:29,640
must be safe too.

638
00:38:30,620 --> 00:38:31,620
Good to hear that.

639
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:32,790
Oh, right,

640
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:34,720
how did you find the Hidden Underground Passage?

641
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,040
Do you remember the time

642
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,940
I helped you steal the Trial Chart from the Divine Mechanism Hall?

643
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,210
As a result, I happened to see a landscape map

644
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:41,140
of Mount Suyu at the Fengyu Branch.

645
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:43,110
Luckily, I have a photographic memory.

646
00:38:43,110 --> 00:38:44,550
I memorized it after just a few glances.

647
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:46,680
I didn't expect it to come in handy now.

648
00:38:47,550 --> 00:38:49,150
Not bad. Thoughtful as ever.

649
00:38:50,030 --> 00:38:50,950
Junior Jing?

650
00:38:51,340 --> 00:38:52,540
What happened to her?

651
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,080
She was hit by Minghuang's Lotus Thorn.

652
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:57,080
It's all my fault.

653
00:38:57,130 --> 00:38:59,190
I should have had her come down first.

654
00:38:59,220 --> 00:38:59,920
Lingyun,

655
00:39:00,310 --> 00:39:01,170
how about this?

656
00:39:01,230 --> 00:39:03,000
Let's have Junior Jing rest here,

657
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,960
and you come with me to take a look inside.

658
00:39:03,960 --> 00:39:04,360
Okay.

659
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:09,040
Mo Xiao?

660
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:10,020
Are you alright?

661
00:39:11,230 --> 00:39:12,030
It's nothing.

662
00:39:13,750 --> 00:39:15,380
I'm just a little lightheaded, likely from the Heavenly Demon Spirits

663
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:17,020
draining my spiritual power back in

664
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:18,480
the Heavenly Demon Abyss.

665
00:39:19,020 --> 00:39:19,680
Jing,

666
00:39:20,020 --> 00:39:21,150
how are you feeling?

667
00:39:21,610 --> 00:39:22,370
I'm fine.

668
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,250
Don't worry.

669
00:39:24,330 --> 00:39:25,630
Hold on a little longer.

670
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,610
Once we get out of here,

671
00:39:26,610 --> 00:39:28,640
I'll have Zisu detoxify you right away.

672
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,910
Don't worry about me.

673
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:31,730
Hurry and find the exit.

674
00:39:31,900 --> 00:39:32,380
Okay.

675
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,960
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

676
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,830
This is the Hidden Underground Passage of the demons?

677
00:39:45,830 --> 00:39:46,630
That's right.

678
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:47,860
When I first saw this place

679
00:39:47,860 --> 00:39:48,980
on the map,

680
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:50,470
I was very shocked as well.

681
00:39:50,990 --> 00:39:52,140
Who would've thought there's such

682
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,170
an enormous underground network beneath the Heavenly Demon Sect?

683
00:39:54,170 --> 00:39:56,620
It almost runs through the entire Mount Suyu.

684
00:39:56,620 --> 00:39:57,970
Now, if we follow this main path

685
00:39:57,970 --> 00:39:59,550
all the way to the end and then turn right,

686
00:39:59,550 --> 00:40:02,230
we can directly reach a deep pool at the bottom of Mount Suyu.

687
00:40:02,230 --> 00:40:04,430
Even if all the exits are guarded by demon soldiers,

688
00:40:04,430 --> 00:40:06,960
they certainly won't be guarding that place.

689
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:08,970
All the exits?

690
00:40:09,630 --> 00:40:11,040
You mean that this Hidden Underground Passage

691
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,510
can lead to various palaces of the Heavenly Demon Sect?

692
00:40:12,510 --> 00:40:13,310
That's right.

693
00:40:14,550 --> 00:40:15,940
Then Chongguang's Formless Palace...

694
00:40:15,940 --> 00:40:16,610
Mo Xiao,

695
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,700
at a time like this,

696
00:40:17,860 --> 00:40:19,780
saving ourselves is the priority.

697
00:40:19,780 --> 00:40:21,900
I came here to rescue Lixue in the first place.

698
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,900
I haven't fulfilled my promise yet.

699
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,690
Why are you so stubborn?

700
00:40:26,470 --> 00:40:28,770
Lixue is now Chongguang's beloved disciple.

701
00:40:28,770 --> 00:40:30,540
Whether she wants to go with you or not is hard to say.

702
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,670
Who even cares about some old promise?

703
00:40:33,130 --> 00:40:34,000
I care.

704
00:40:36,210 --> 00:40:37,130
Pain in my neck.

705
00:40:37,870 --> 00:40:39,600
You're really a pain in my neck.

706
00:40:48,190 --> 00:40:49,050
Remember that?

707
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:51,130
You take Junior Jing

708
00:40:51,150 --> 00:40:52,370
down the mountain to heal her wounds first.

709
00:40:52,370 --> 00:40:53,290
I'll go to the Formless Palace.

710
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:53,810
Okay.

711
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,110
Be sure to stay safe.

712
00:40:57,510 --> 00:40:59,640
Let's meet at the foot of the mountain.

713
00:42:15,750 --> 00:42:16,600
Jing,

714
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,490
we're about to get out of here.

715
00:42:18,660 --> 00:42:19,950
Hold your breath in a moment, okay?

716
00:42:19,950 --> 00:42:20,630
Okay.
