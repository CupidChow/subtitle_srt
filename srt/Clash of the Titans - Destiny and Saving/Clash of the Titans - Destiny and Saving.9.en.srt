00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,650
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:38,640
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,640
You're so beautiful,

4
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:46,840
so full of tender grace.

5
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:49,720
Even if you were to cut me into a thousand pieces,

6
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:53,680
I'd still accept it with no regrets.

7
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,080
It's just a pity

8
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,520
that I can no longer see your peerless beauty.

9
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:05,460
So disgusting.

10
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:07,920
I've never needed

11
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,520
to use force to deal with women.

12
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,830
Is this all you've learned

13
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:14,570
from traveling the martial arts world—frivolity and flirtation?

14
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,000
Of course not.

15
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:18,840
There are so many interesting things in this vast world.

16
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:21,640
Then help me think—

17
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:24,440
how can I get Brother Mo Xiao to take me with him?

18
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:34,450
The pleasure boat has been repaired.

19
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,520
It's time for me to set off.

20
00:02:42,079 --> 00:02:44,460
I had Zisu prepare some glutinous rice balls

21
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:45,970
and store them in the deep well in the yard.

22
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:47,400
If you want some,

23
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,079
just take them out and eat.

24
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:00,680
I also asked Xie Lingyun to find a great healer

25
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,040
to treat the cold syndrome in your body.

26
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:04,350
If you're cured before I return,

27
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:06,280
you can stay at Tiance Villa to recover

28
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,200
and regain your strength.

29
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:08,860
Once I'm back,

30
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,880
I'll help arrange your life after you leave the mountain.

31
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,270
I don't actually find you troublesome.

32
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,280
It's just that the road ahead is extremely dangerous.

33
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:23,880
Staying in Shushan

34
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,320
will be safer for you.

35
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:30,200
I'm leaving now.

36
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:48,720
Wu Chen.

37
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:50,880
Wu Chen?

38
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,079
Those not meant to be will always be passing strangers.

39
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,320
Meeting you was a mistake to begin with.

40
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:02,240
If I'd known how much it would hurt,

41
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:05,400
I'd rather we had never met.

42
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,840
The storybooks are right.

43
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,680
They didn't lie to me.

44
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:13,600
Don't look back, no matter what.

45
00:04:14,980 --> 00:04:16,500
Don't look back, no matter what.

46
00:04:28,230 --> 00:04:32,400
♫Knowing the subtlety of my feelings, understanding the words I cannot fully express♫

47
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,170
♫Thoughts linger from dawn to dusk, murmurs accompany soft words♫

48
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,010
♫A few lines of poetry made it hard to hide my emotions♫

49
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,360
♫In every dream, fallen flowers and willow catkins dance together in the air♫

50
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:49,590
♫Listening to the wind and rain, loneliness resides in your gaze♫

51
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:53,380
♫On one night's encounter, winds rise, and mountains turn green♫

52
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:58,230
♫New lyrics, old melodies, we have missed each other for three lifetimes♫

53
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,610
♫A pool of ink, just flowing in my heart♫

54
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,810
♫Gazing at the morning light reflecting off the snow, bowing my head, my love falls♫

55
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:13,010
♫Thinking of the herons rising, the starry river, my heart stirs♫

56
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,400
♫In the blink of an eye, the endless desolation sets in, and turning back, leaves fall and scatter♫

57
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:21,830
♫My thoughts of love are carved, etched deeply into my heart♫

58
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:43,300
♫Listening to the wind and rain, loneliness resides in your gaze♫

59
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:47,240
♫On one night's encounter, winds rise, and mountains turn green♫

60
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:52,220
♫New lyrics, old melodies, we have missed each other for three lifetimes♫

61
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:55,610
♫A pool of ink, just flowing in my heart♫

♫My thoughts of love are carved, etched deeply into my heart♫

68
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,320
Mo Xiao.

69
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,000
Thank you.

70
00:06:37,030 --> 00:06:39,450
Thank you for taking me down Mang Mountain.

71
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:41,960
Thank you

72
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:45,480
for helping treat my strange cold illness.

73
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,980
Thank you for protecting me

74
00:06:50,159 --> 00:06:51,800
and letting me experience the real human world

75
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,400
for the first time.

76
00:06:55,470 --> 00:06:56,630
For the first time,

77
00:06:57,310 --> 00:06:58,970
I ate hot soup and rice.

78
00:07:00,740 --> 00:07:01,680
And for the first time,

79
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:05,160
I tasted such delicious glutinous rice balls.

80
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
But am I

81
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:12,840
making you feel tired like this?

82
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:16,760
I'm always causing you so much trouble.

83
00:07:18,270 --> 00:07:21,950
I used to live all by myself.

84
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:25,610
Because of you—

85
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,930
you protected me,

86
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:29,680
warmed me,

87
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:31,680
and sheltered me—

88
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,659
I felt truly happy.

89
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,470
But...

90
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,000
if these aren't things you like to do...

91
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:47,960
So from now on,

92
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:50,420
why don't you be the one to keep doing this for me?

93
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:52,550
Then maybe…

94
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:56,000
you're not the one fate intended for me.

95
00:07:57,640 --> 00:07:58,820
I'm leaving.

96
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,080
Don't worry.

97
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:08,460
I've learned how to interact with people now.

98
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,320
I'm not the same Wu Chen as before.

99
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,960
I've even learned to read storybooks.

100
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,920
I won't cause trouble for any of you anymore.

101
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,070
I never said you were trouble for me.

102
00:08:27,260 --> 00:08:28,220
Mo Xiao!

103
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:33,090
Let me take you with me.

104
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,200
To go back?

105
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:36,549
Yes.

106
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:40,200
I twisted my ankle.

107
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,720
I can't walk now.

108
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,600
I'll carry you.

109
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:47,120
Are you sure you want to carry me back?

110
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:48,520
I'm sure.

111
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,970
Well, I didn't ask to go back.

112
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:55,560
I'm not clinging to you.

113
00:09:19,810 --> 00:09:21,060
Brother Mo Xiao,

114
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:23,530
I advise you to give up that idea now.

115
00:09:23,830 --> 00:09:25,850
There's no way I'm staying here to take care of her.

116
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,580
You once said

117
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:30,140
you wouldn't leave me behind.

118
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,040
Junior Jing,

119
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:34,410
Miss Wu Chen is practicing

120
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,720
the Ice Sword Technique I taught her.

121
00:09:35,890 --> 00:09:37,920
She's gradually been learning to control the cold aura in her body,

122
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,440
and now she's able to communicate with others.

123
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:40,960
She won't hurt you.

124
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,210
I'm not afraid she'll hurt me.

125
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,760
I'm afraid I'll hurt her.

126
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:52,440
The road to Myriad Isles Ice Lake

127
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,450
is full of danger.

128
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:54,900
If I take you two with me

129
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:56,680
and something happens to you along the way,

130
00:09:56,840 --> 00:09:58,440
-I...
-Something may happen to her.

131
00:09:58,760 --> 00:09:59,600
Nothing will happen to me.

132
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:01,770
This time,

133
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,320
you'll have to take them along whether you want to or not.

134
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,750
What's that?

135
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:10,170
Are you saying you're going to take me with you?

136
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,140
Why are you not thanking me?

137
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:12,960
What is this?

138
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,100
Just tell me!

139
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,440
We've got news?

140
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:17,360
I just received Shi Bujiu's reply to the wine letter.

141
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,380
(To Xie Lingyun, Young Master of Tielyv Branch of Shushan Sect)
I just received Shi Bujiu's reply to the wine letter.

142
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:18,990
I just received Shi Bujiu's reply to the wine letter.

143
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:19,800
What did he say?

144
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,520
He said he's heading to Myriad Isles Ice Lake soon

145
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,780
and wants to meet us

146
00:10:22,840 --> 00:10:24,600
at Peach Blossom Villa there in half a month.

147
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:26,840
What does that mean?

148
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,440
To save Wu Chen, Mo Xiao asked me

149
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:29,940
to find a divine doctor.

150
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:31,990
I just received a reply from him,

151
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:33,000
so...

152
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,150
So Wu Chen has to go with you.

153
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:36,800
Does that mean I don't need to stay behind?

154
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:38,560
That's great!

155
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,800
Shi Bujiu is also going to Myriad Isles Ice Lake?

156
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,520
He has always stayed away from worldly matters.

157
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:46,040
Could it be that he's also drawn in by the Heavenly Secret Treasury?

158
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,240
Looks like this is going to be quite an event.

159
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,080
We certainly can't miss it.

160
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,440
Pack up your things.

161
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:53,440
Let's set off immediately.

162
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:54,080
Alright.

163
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:57,120
This must be fate.

164
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,670
Wu Chen,

165
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:26,920
why are you hiding?

166
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,960
Come out and let us see.

167
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:29,880
Wu Chen, come out!

168
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:45,180
Why are you hiding?

169
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:46,790
Let us take a look.

170
00:11:48,250 --> 00:11:49,510
Stop blocking your face.

171
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:00,300
Why are you laughing?

172
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,200
Before, Hua

173
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:05,330
did my makeup just like this.

174
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:06,190
These rouges

175
00:12:06,220 --> 00:12:07,480
might not suit you,

176
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,880
but looking at you now,

177
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,270
they actually add a touch of cuteness.

178
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,570
Zisu,

179
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,500
help Miss Wu Chen change into a new outfit.

180
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:15,630
Let's set off right away.

181
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,170
How is it?

182
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,080
I'm better at this, right?

183
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:34,570
Jing,

184
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:35,870
you should go change into another outfit as well.

185
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:37,280
Your outfit now

186
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:38,280
is a bit too flashy.

187
00:12:38,530 --> 00:12:39,840
Change into something more plain.

188
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:41,570
This way, it'll be easier for us to move around.

189
00:12:42,350 --> 00:12:44,420
If you want to compliment me, just say it directly.

190
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:45,600
I got it.

191
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:29,080
Wait...

192
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:43,980
Mo Xiao.

193
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:08,500
This outfit suits you quite well.

194
00:14:09,370 --> 00:14:10,240
I'm ready too.

195
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:16,700
Jing,

196
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,920
this outfit suits you very well too.

197
00:14:22,830 --> 00:14:23,840
It's getting late.

198
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,270
Let's get going.

199
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,560
Be careful.

200
00:15:13,720 --> 00:15:15,440
Mo Xiao told me to keep you safe.

201
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,100
Don't cause me any trouble.

202
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:19,840
Got it.

203
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,030
Mo Xiao said

204
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:22,270
I'm not trouble.

205
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:23,560
I'm his responsibility.

206
00:15:24,670 --> 00:15:25,840
You are trouble.

207
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:35,770
Young Sect Leader,

208
00:15:35,840 --> 00:15:37,220
the rooms are ready.

209
00:15:37,240 --> 00:15:38,680
There happen to be three fine chambers on the second floor.

210
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,010
You and Young Master Xie will each have one.

211
00:15:40,040 --> 00:15:41,640
Miss Murong and Miss Wu Chen will share the other.

212
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:42,400
Okay.

213
00:15:42,960 --> 00:15:44,360
I don't want to share a room with Wu Chen.

214
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:45,520
Why not?

215
00:15:46,990 --> 00:15:49,360
I'm not used to having someone next to me when I sleep.

216
00:15:49,860 --> 00:15:51,790
Then what will you do when you get married someday?

217
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:53,680
You talk too much.

218
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:57,240
You're just afraid someone will hear you snore, right?

219
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:01,590
You're in charge of keeping Miss Wu Chen safe.

220
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:03,470
It's more convenient if you stay in the same room.

221
00:16:03,530 --> 00:16:05,040
I'm a light sleeper.

222
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:06,520
I can stay next door.

223
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,760
Besides,

224
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,360
we're all on this pleasure boat,

225
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,440
and it's floating on a vast river.

226
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:12,560
What danger could there possibly be?

227
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,050
How about this?

228
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:18,000
I'll take one room,

229
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:19,160
and Wu Chen will take one.

230
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,940
Mo Xiao,

231
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:22,570
can you just make do

232
00:16:22,680 --> 00:16:23,920
and share a room

233
00:16:23,960 --> 00:16:24,400
with Xie Lingyun?

234
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:25,320
No!

235
00:16:26,960 --> 00:16:27,800
It won't be him making do.

236
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,880
It will be me!

237
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:30,400
Well, maybe "making do" isn't the right word.

238
00:16:30,440 --> 00:16:31,810
It should be "bored."

239
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:33,760
You have no idea how dull he is.

240
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:35,730
He always meditates

241
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,160
and doesn't allow anyone to talk while he's doing it.

242
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,760
If I have to share a room with him,

243
00:16:39,800 --> 00:16:40,760
I'll die of boredom.

244
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,590
Mo Xiao isn't dull.

245
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:45,470
You're just too noisy.

246
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,540
If you don't believe me,

247
00:16:49,880 --> 00:16:51,200
try sharing a room with him yourself.

248
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:54,040
What are you talking about, Xie Lingyun?

249
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,960
Alright.

250
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,680
Stop arguing.

251
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,720
I'll share a room with Mo Xiao.

252
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:13,960
How do you think

253
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:15,170
we should sleep?

254
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,650
On the bed, of course.

255
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:20,079
This bed is so soft.

256
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
It must be really comfortable

257
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:22,520
if we hug each other.

258
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:23,599
Who are you going to hug?

259
00:17:24,359 --> 00:17:25,280
You.

260
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:27,079
When I was at Mang Mountain,

261
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,160
I always slept holding Snowy.

262
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:30,640
That way, I never felt cold.

263
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,320
Are you a three-year-old child?

264
00:17:32,360 --> 00:17:33,520
Hugging each other while sleeping?

265
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:34,680
Let me tell you.

266
00:17:34,840 --> 00:17:35,730
I hate being touched

267
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,000
when I sleep.

268
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,320
You must not touch me.

269
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:43,200
Look over there.

270
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:45,080
What's that?

271
00:17:51,050 --> 00:17:51,890
Wu Chen!

272
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:52,720
Drive it away!

273
00:17:52,760 --> 00:17:53,580
Hurry!

274
00:17:54,660 --> 00:17:56,300
Now I understand.

275
00:17:56,440 --> 00:17:58,320
The reason you don't want me to hug you

276
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:01,400
is because you want to hug me.

277
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,570
Who wants to hug you?

278
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:08,980
It looks like it's crawling towards here.

279
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,480
Hurry up and drive it away, Wu Chen!

280
00:18:10,560 --> 00:18:11,480
I can't hold it anymore!

281
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:12,480
I'm really scared!

282
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,880
Hurry up and get rid of it!

283
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:15,880
Well, let me make it clear:

284
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:17,320
It's you who wants to hug me.

285
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:18,280
Alright, alright!

286
00:18:18,370 --> 00:18:19,640
Hurry and get rid of it!

287
00:18:19,680 --> 00:18:20,720
Please!

288
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,400
Then let go of me.

289
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:24,360
No.

290
00:18:29,780 --> 00:18:31,560
Oh, women.

291
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:41,400
After we get to Myriad Isles Ice Lake, find Shi Bujiu,

292
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:42,480
and get Wu Chen cured,

293
00:18:42,840 --> 00:18:43,800
are we really going to let her go?

294
00:18:45,680 --> 00:18:47,520
I'm afraid even Shi Bujiu might not be able to cure her.

295
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,760
Then why did you make me go through so much trouble to find him?

296
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:51,880
Shi Bujiu might not be able to cure Wu Chen,

297
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:53,280
but her illness

298
00:18:53,800 --> 00:18:55,440
must be treated by him.

299
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,680
What do you mean by that?

300
00:18:58,840 --> 00:18:59,960
You've confused me.

301
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,280
Oh, right.

302
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,580
When Wu Chen was locked in the Demon Subduing Palace

303
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,720
and I was punished at the Sword Pavilion,

304
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,080
did anything unusual happen at Shushan Sect?

305
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,400
Did any strangers come?

306
00:19:08,680 --> 00:19:09,400
I don't think so.

307
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:11,200
There was no unusual activity.

308
00:19:12,170 --> 00:19:14,030
Then who was the person with the mask?

309
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:14,960
Mask?

310
00:19:15,560 --> 00:19:16,400
What mask?

311
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:17,680
Never mind.

312
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,040
Young Sect Leader,

313
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,640
the Crimson Feather Chain you asked me to make

314
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:21,440
is ready.

315
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:24,520
What's this?

316
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,680
Is it your new magical weapon?

317
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:28,960
This is a protective item I prepared for Wu Chen.

318
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:29,840
You're giving it to her?

319
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,470
Why not give it to me?

320
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,120
You are giving me this rope as a self-defense tool,

321
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:38,040
right?

322
00:19:38,810 --> 00:19:39,760
This isn't a rope.

323
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,000
It's called the Crimson Feather Chain.

324
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:45,060
It's a powerful magical weapon.

325
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,000
Mo Xiao,

326
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:19,660
she has no foundation,

327
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:20,440
yet you're giving her

328
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:22,040
such a difficult self-defense weapon.

329
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:24,270
You're not being sincere at all.

330
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,280
Are you Lixue or not?

331
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:23,120
Jing,

332
00:22:23,670 --> 00:22:25,150
I made a little gift for you.

333
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,120
What is it?

334
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,920
Don't run away!

335
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,050
This is a mechanical spider I made especially for you.

336
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,480
Look, it's really cute.

337
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,240
It even moves.

338
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:39,360
-I don't want it!
-Isn't it cute?

339
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:40,600
Jing!

340
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:43,000
Young Master.

341
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,120
How could you make such a toy for a girl?

342
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,030
They like cute animals,

343
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,400
like kittens, puppies,

344
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:54,660
chicks, and birds.

345
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:57,850
Who would make a big black bug like this for a girl to play with?

346
00:22:58,040 --> 00:22:59,120
You really don't understand it.

347
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:00,920
You blockhead.

348
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:02,070
As if you know everything.

349
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:04,280
Young Sect Leader.

350
00:23:04,640 --> 00:23:05,400
Xie Lingyun,

351
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,320
don't bully my people.

352
00:23:06,440 --> 00:23:07,760
What do you mean by bullying your people?

353
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,240
Zimu is from our Tielyv Branch.

354
00:23:09,320 --> 00:23:11,180
By rights, I'm her Young Master.

355
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,400
Zimu, tell us yourself.

356
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,200
Whose side are you on?

357
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:15,200
She's still my person.

358
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,180
Zimu,

359
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:19,710
I've finished my morning lessons.

360
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:20,950
You don't need to stay here anymore.

361
00:23:21,280 --> 00:23:22,520
Go check if Zifeng and Zisu

362
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,410
need any help.

363
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:23,880
Yes.

364
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,160
Don't swing it out like that.

365
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,990
It should fly out like this.

366
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,950
-I just can't.
-Let me show you.

367
00:23:44,160 --> 00:23:46,080
These two girls are really strange.

368
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:47,760
Just a few days ago, they were at odds with each other.

369
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:49,520
Now they're as close as one person.

370
00:23:50,410 --> 00:23:51,720
Women.

371
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:52,880
I really don't understand them.

372
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:55,400
Watch me.

373
00:24:01,510 --> 00:24:02,790
Like this.

374
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:04,320
How many times have I told you?

375
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,080
Why can't you understand?

376
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:07,960
Try a few more times.

377
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,040
It's really strange.

378
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:18,600
Mo Xiao has so many magical weapons,

379
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:19,720
including some small ones.

380
00:24:19,840 --> 00:24:21,720
Why did he specifically give you the Crimson Feather Chain?

381
00:24:22,240 --> 00:24:23,560
It's really difficult to use.

382
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:25,880
And you're not as smart as me.

383
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,560
I think this chain is pretty good.

384
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,120
It's perfect for tying up lunch boxes.

385
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:32,080
All you think about is food.

386
00:24:32,200 --> 00:24:33,200
Mo Xiao gave you this

387
00:24:33,240 --> 00:24:34,800
for self-defense.

388
00:24:35,800 --> 00:24:36,640
Self-defense?

389
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:37,920
Yes, it means when you encounter bad people,

390
00:24:37,940 --> 00:24:39,170
you should use it to hit them.

391
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:39,840
Do you understand?

392
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,240
But...

393
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:42,840
I'm a bad person.

394
00:24:43,240 --> 00:24:45,200
When I came down from Mang Mountain,

395
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:46,640
everyone was afraid of me.

396
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:48,440
No one would bully me.

397
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,240
You're not a bad person.

398
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,560
You're just scary.

399
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,320
You can't use this recklessly.

400
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:54,640
You have to fight bad people

401
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,080
and protect good people with it.

402
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:57,080
Got it?

403
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,110
So let me ask you.

404
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,720
Are they good people or bad people?

405
00:25:07,630 --> 00:25:08,880
What are you two looking at?

406
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,290
Aren't those Madam Poison, Hong Yue,

407
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,360
the Lord of Bijing Island,

408
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,960
and the Lord of Longevity Valley?

409
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:23,670
The three of them are fighting. Who should we help?

410
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:24,890
Right,

411
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:26,160
who should we help?

412
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:27,400
Help?

413
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,320
Youthful chivalry.

414
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:33,840
As a veteran of the martial arts world,

415
00:25:33,960 --> 00:25:35,320
I can tell you from my experience

416
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,600
that the best way

417
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:38,480
to handle a situation like this is

418
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:39,880
to take a detour.

419
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:41,440
Take a detour?

420
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,000
From my experience,

421
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,160
when wandering the martial arts world, you must remember:

422
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,840
Never watch others fight.

423
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,400
Otherwise, you might get scammed.

424
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:52,480
Mo Xiao!

425
00:25:56,120 --> 00:25:57,290
Youthful chivalry.

426
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,880
A typical case of youthful chivalry.

427
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:16,280
-Young Sect Leader?
-Young Sect Leader?

428
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,060
Who are you?

429
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,480
How dare you take the Phoenix Feather Order?

430
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,160
Boy,

431
00:26:22,240 --> 00:26:23,680
you seem to be from a righteous immortal sect too.

432
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:25,680
Why are you also interested in the Heavenly Secret Manual?

433
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,560
Young immortal,

434
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,680
your immortal sects has strict rules.

435
00:26:29,080 --> 00:26:31,560
It's better if you don't get involved in this matter.

436
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:32,600
Everyone,

437
00:26:32,840 --> 00:26:34,490
since the Phoenix Feather Token is already in my hands,

438
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,040
please stop fighting over it.

439
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:37,640
What did they say?

440
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:40,430
They are mocking our Immortal Sect of Shushan,

441
00:26:40,680 --> 00:26:42,250
saying we covet the Heavenly Secret Manual

442
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,120
and are hypocrites.

443
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,380
This guy is usually the most composed.

444
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,530
What's gotten into him today?

445
00:26:46,560 --> 00:26:47,680
So reckless.

446
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,280
What else did they say?

447
00:26:51,320 --> 00:26:53,600
There's no need to waste words with this little brat.

448
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:55,920
Taking back the Phoenix Feather Token is what matters.

449
00:26:56,320 --> 00:26:58,800
They called Brother Mo Xiao a snot-nosed kid who...

450
00:26:59,880 --> 00:27:00,520
Jing!

451
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:02,120
Don't go and make the situation worse!

452
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,520
You guys are really giving me a headache.

453
00:27:05,920 --> 00:27:07,400
You three, take care of Wu Chen.

454
00:27:09,680 --> 00:27:10,760
I'm going too!

455
00:27:10,840 --> 00:27:11,560
With Young Master Xie there,

456
00:27:11,600 --> 00:27:12,680
nothing will happen to the Young Sect Leader.

457
00:27:24,560 --> 00:27:25,490
Moye Sword?

458
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:26,950
Pagoda Bell?

459
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:28,670
Who exactly are you from Shushan Sect?

460
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:31,040
I'm Xie Lingyun, Young Master of Tielyv Branch

461
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,360
in Shushan Sect.

462
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,080
I'm Murong Jing, Young Master

463
00:27:34,160 --> 00:27:35,120
of Fengyu Branch.

464
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,680
So Shushan Sect

465
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,040
really wants to get involved in this?

466
00:27:39,280 --> 00:27:40,400
Whoever possesses the Phoenix Feather Token

467
00:27:40,560 --> 00:27:43,110
can enter the Heavenly Secret Treasury with the Phoenix-masked Woman.

468
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,600
Please pass along a message for me

469
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,990
and tell the Phoenix-masked Woman to show herself

470
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:47,080
and fulfill her promise.

471
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:48,480
Mo Xiao,

472
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,720
what are you doing?

473
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,880
Fine.

474
00:27:53,040 --> 00:27:54,460
Since you want to make a big scene,

475
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:56,040
as your brother, I'll see it through with you.

476
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:56,880
Let's go!

477
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,080
Are you alright?

478
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:13,440
Are you hurt?

479
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,200
I'm fine.

480
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:18,680
Next time something like this happens,

481
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:20,760
I'll use the Ice Sword Technique to help you.

482
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:21,400
You must not.

483
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:22,920
I taught you the Ice Sword Technique

484
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:24,880
so you could suppress your own inner cold.

485
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:26,680
If you use it to harm others for no reason,

486
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:27,680
it'll backfire on you.

487
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:28,840
Don't worry.

488
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:29,840
Dealing with these people

489
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,360
doesn't require your help.

490
00:28:32,280 --> 00:28:33,000
That's right.

491
00:28:33,400 --> 00:28:36,000
Then if you run into someone you can't handle,

492
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:37,600
I'll step in.

493
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,360
Young Sect...

494
00:28:39,880 --> 00:28:40,440
Sir.

495
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:41,880
In the future, if something like this happens again,

496
00:28:41,900 --> 00:28:43,260
just tell us to deal with it.

497
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:44,560
You don't need to show yourself.

498
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:45,920
Exactly.

499
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,880
What was wrong with you today?

500
00:28:48,120 --> 00:28:49,190
Usually, even if

501
00:28:49,240 --> 00:28:50,440
the sky were to fall,

502
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,920
you wouldn't even bat an eye.

503
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:52,840
But today,

504
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:53,840
you rushed over first.

505
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,120
Was it just for that stupid token?

506
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:56,600
Young Sect Leader,

507
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:58,080
have you forgotten what the Sect Leader told us?

508
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,880
We should keep a low profile and travel incognito.

509
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:01,440
Have you ever thought about

510
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,840
why the Phoenix-masked Woman is making such a big fuss

511
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,960
and announcing to the world that she is going to open

512
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:06,880
the Tianxing Secret Treasury?

513
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,520
She just wants to show off.

514
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:11,080
Do you think everyone is like you?

515
00:29:11,200 --> 00:29:12,010
I was joking.

516
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,160
Couldn't you tell?

517
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:14,440
If you ask me,

518
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:16,120
the true intention of the Phoenix-masked Woman

519
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,600
is to use the Tianxing Secret Treasury to win over various sects

520
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:19,880
and then take revenge on Shushan.

521
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:21,680
Am I wrong?

522
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:22,920
She does want revenge.

523
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:25,160
And she does want to stir up conflict.

524
00:29:25,880 --> 00:29:26,480
But her real goal

525
00:29:27,040 --> 00:29:28,280
is to lure a certain person out.

526
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:29,200
Who?

527
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,080
Me.

528
00:29:32,760 --> 00:29:33,800
You?

529
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,320
You like it?

530
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:56,760
I just think it's beautiful.

531
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:03,020
Take it.

532
00:30:05,670 --> 00:30:06,630
It's mine now?

533
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,640
No, Wu Chen.

534
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,000
This is something very important.

535
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:15,060
You can't play with it.

536
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:16,200
Hurry up and return it to Mo Xiao.

537
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:18,000
It's just an object.

538
00:30:18,440 --> 00:30:18,960
It's nothing.

539
00:30:21,160 --> 00:30:23,080
Then I want it too.

540
00:30:23,920 --> 00:30:25,360
Well, you can have it.

541
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:29,960
Or should I not give it to you?

542
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,120
Wu Chen!

543
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,810
You actually learned to lie!

544
00:30:33,590 --> 00:30:34,620
Come back here!

545
00:30:36,450 --> 00:30:37,720
Only by luring out the Phoenix-masked Woman

546
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:39,400
can I confirm

547
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,160
who the real Lixue is between you two.

548
00:30:55,960 --> 00:30:56,660
Tell me.

549
00:30:58,380 --> 00:30:59,070
Supreme Lord,

550
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,200
the Phoenix-masked Woman has released the Phoenix Feather Token,

551
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:03,490
making Mo Xiao the target of everyone's attention.

552
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,770
The Phoenix Feather Token

553
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,200
is now in Mo Xiao's hands?

554
00:31:12,760 --> 00:31:13,600
Mo Xiao

555
00:31:13,680 --> 00:31:15,740
seemed to have seen through the Phoenix-masked Woman's intentions.

556
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:16,720
He boldly declared

557
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:18,460
that he is the disciple of Sword Sovereign Fengyue

558
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:19,680
and took the Phoenix Feather Token.

559
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:22,520
This boy

560
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:24,000
has some guts.

561
00:31:24,770 --> 00:31:25,680
But Supreme Lord,

562
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,370
once Mo Xiao shows up,

563
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:28,800
I'm afraid the Phoenix-masked Woman...

564
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,720
Go tell her

565
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:33,600
to use her brain when doing things

566
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,680
and not mess with my plan.

567
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:38,040
Yes.

568
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:44,000
Anything else?

569
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:44,960
Supreme Lord,

570
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,680
there's something I don't understand.

571
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,230
Ji Xingluo?

572
00:31:50,360 --> 00:31:50,880
Supreme Lord,

573
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,960
you know that Dark Soul Star Lord is taking action.

574
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,160
Why don't you stop her?

575
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:55,640
What if she interferes...

576
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,300
The Tianxing Secret Treasury is such a big deal.

577
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,680
If a Star Lord of the Heavenly Demon Sect

578
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,410
doesn't participate,

579
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:06,680
it would be strange.

580
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,250
Let her be.

581
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:10,530
Supreme Lord, you are wise.

582
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:13,500
Mother,

583
00:32:13,650 --> 00:32:15,190
I disappointed you.

584
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,600
I don't allow you to say that.

585
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,200
Have you forgotten

586
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,650
how I raised you

587
00:32:19,680 --> 00:32:21,000
these past 18 years?

588
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:23,840
Have you forgotten what we are supposed to do?

589
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,550
How could you possibly disappoint me?

590
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,720
But mother,

591
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:30,880
we've been searching for so many years

592
00:32:31,320 --> 00:32:32,440
and still haven't found anything.

593
00:32:33,640 --> 00:32:34,280
What if...

594
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:35,350
There is no "what if!"

595
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:37,190
We will definitely find him.

596
00:32:37,520 --> 00:32:39,450
He is the future Supreme Lord of our Heavenly Demon Sect

597
00:32:39,600 --> 00:32:41,360
and my only hope to survive!

598
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,620
Did he really say that?

599
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:57,620
The news says that

600
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:58,680
the Phoenix-masked Woman

601
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,900
released a Phoenix Feather Token

602
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,920
and announced to the world

603
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,840
that anyone who gets the Phoenix Feather Token

604
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:05,840
can enter the Tianxing Secret Treasury

605
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:08,760
and freely choose any secret manual and magical weapon they like.

606
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,640
As soon as these words were released,

607
00:33:10,960 --> 00:33:12,640
chaos erupted throughout the world.

608
00:33:13,480 --> 00:33:14,380
Mo Xiao and others

609
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:15,480
just happened to encounter this conflict

610
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,560
between the various sects in the martial arts world.

611
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,920
Mo Xiao wanted to step in and stop it,

612
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:23,720
so he publicly declared his sect.

613
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:24,680
How dare he!

614
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:28,640
He actually forgot my instructions before he left.

615
00:33:29,040 --> 00:33:30,960
He lacks experience and is naive about the world.

616
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:32,360
He just misspoke in the heat of the moment.

617
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:36,440
No.

618
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:38,680
This isn't

619
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,880
like Mo Xiao.

620
00:33:41,480 --> 00:33:44,520
His high-profile reveal of his identification as Shushan disciple

621
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:47,040
must have been intentional.

622
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,480
Sect Master, you mean that

623
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,200
there might be another reason behind this?

624
00:33:51,700 --> 00:33:53,300
Mo Xiao's actions

625
00:33:53,600 --> 00:33:55,880
were for that Phoenix Feather Token?

626
00:33:58,640 --> 00:34:00,620
Once the Phoenix Feather Token is revealed,

627
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:03,830
all the sects in the martial arts world will start fighting

628
00:34:03,960 --> 00:34:05,400
to claim it.

629
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,520
By taking the Phoenix Feather Token, Mo Xiao

630
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:12,560
might be trying to stop this bloodshed in the martial arts world.

631
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:13,800
If that's the case,

632
00:34:14,050 --> 00:34:16,560
it sounds like a plan from the Young Sect Leader of Shushan.

633
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:19,840
You do understand Mo Xiao better, Sect Leader.

634
00:34:20,949 --> 00:34:22,250
However, if this is true,

635
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,040
I'm afraid

636
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:26,449
people in the martial arts world will criticize our Shushan,

637
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:28,389
saying that as a righteous immortal sect,

638
00:34:28,440 --> 00:34:29,920
we are fighting with evil forces

639
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,440
for the Heavenly Secret Treasury.

640
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,280
If the Phoenix-masked Woman

641
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,980
really is going to open the Heavenly Secret Treasury,

642
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:38,120
Shushan

643
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,000
will have to step in sooner or later to stop her.

644
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:42,280
We can't avoid being misunderstood.

645
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,449
Let them say what they want.

646
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:48,620
You're right, Sect Leader.

647
00:34:49,199 --> 00:34:50,880
Although public opinion can be fearsome,

648
00:34:51,480 --> 00:34:53,320
our Shushan Sect is righteous

649
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:55,840
and doesn't have to be concerned with such small matters.

650
00:34:58,200 --> 00:34:59,840
It's just that their journey

651
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,360
will likely be far from peaceful from now on.

652
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:13,680
(Wu Chen)

653
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,590
(Wu Chen)

654
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:29,300
Aren't you going to help?

655
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,260
No need.

656
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:31,280
Keep practicing calligraphy.

657
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:49,130
These evil forces...

658
00:35:49,360 --> 00:35:50,920
They know they can't win,

659
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:53,440
yet they still come in waves to test us.

660
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:57,760
And we from immortal sects can't use spells against them.

661
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,960
I have to use my fists to drive them away.

662
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:00,960
I'm exhausted.

663
00:36:01,080 --> 00:36:02,000
Exactly.

664
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:03,920
Even my Pagoda Bell can't be used.

665
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:05,240
However,

666
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,240
the sound of my Pagoda Bell won't kill them.

667
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:08,760
It just repels them.

668
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,010
Can't I use it either?

669
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,760
No, you can't.

670
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:13,400
How did you learn the Shushan regulations?

671
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,330
I think once we return,

672
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,440
I should send you to Luntian Branch

673
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,640
to learn

674
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:18,280
all 1,380 rules of Shushan throughly.

675
00:36:18,360 --> 00:36:20,080
As if you can remember all of them.

676
00:36:20,690 --> 00:36:21,600
Who was the one

677
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,000
always sneaking out to catch beetles?

678
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,000
Do we really have to hurt each other like this?

679
00:36:27,160 --> 00:36:28,000
You started it.

680
00:36:28,020 --> 00:36:29,110
Fine, you win.

681
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:29,960
Mo Xiao,

682
00:36:30,520 --> 00:36:31,610
they're so persistent,

683
00:36:31,640 --> 00:36:32,720
keeping coming relentlessly.

684
00:36:32,840 --> 00:36:34,080
Are we just going to keep fighting like this?

685
00:36:34,520 --> 00:36:36,680
The truly important guests haven't arrived yet.

686
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,160
These are just the ones sent ahead.

687
00:36:39,460 --> 00:36:39,980
So...

688
00:36:40,810 --> 00:36:42,810
are we just going to stay here and be living targets?

689
00:36:43,960 --> 00:36:44,870
Of course not.

690
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:01,680
Star Lord,

691
00:37:01,700 --> 00:37:02,640
I have failed.

692
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:03,720
There was no one on the ship.

693
00:37:10,210 --> 00:37:11,890
You must find him

694
00:37:12,090 --> 00:37:13,640
before anyone else does.

695
00:37:14,200 --> 00:37:14,840
Yes.

696
00:37:35,080 --> 00:37:35,840
Young Sect Leader,

697
00:37:36,120 --> 00:37:37,280
the one who came is Ji Xingluo,

698
00:37:37,400 --> 00:37:39,160
Star Lord of the Dark Soul Palace from the Heavenly Demon Sect.

699
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,520
Even people from the Demon Sect are here?

700
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:41,950
Looks like this matter

701
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,400
is getting bigger and bigger.

702
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,840
Why is this girl so sleepy lately?

703
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:49,480
She looks like she's about to fall asleep at any moment.

704
00:37:49,500 --> 00:37:51,140
She's probably seasick.

705
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,760
What's seasick?

706
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:53,890
It means

707
00:37:53,920 --> 00:37:55,040
when you've been on the water too long,

708
00:37:55,160 --> 00:37:55,920
you feel dizzy

709
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:56,580
and unwell.

710
00:37:57,320 --> 00:37:58,440
Then how come I'm fine?

711
00:37:58,560 --> 00:37:59,760
Of course you're fine.

712
00:37:59,880 --> 00:38:00,920
You're not that delicate.

713
00:38:03,840 --> 00:38:05,060
Just now on that ship,

714
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,390
I left them a little surprise.

715
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,640
What's wrong with you?

716
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,440
Why are you carrying so many disgusting spider stamps?

717
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,040
Although I made the spider stamps,

718
00:38:11,160 --> 00:38:12,720
it was Mo Xiao's idea.

719
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,120
That Madam Poison is spreading

720
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:16,300
that the Phoenix Feather Token is in our hands.

721
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:18,330
She's trying to use others to kill us

722
00:38:18,400 --> 00:38:19,660
so she can reap the benefits.

723
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,160
So this is us giving her a taste of her own medicine.

724
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,840
Why do I feel like it's swaying too?

725
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:26,880
You must be getting seasick too.

726
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:27,760
Here.

727
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:29,170
You can lean on me.

728
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,770
Stop swaying.

729
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:35,810
I'm not swaying.

730
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,000
It's the boat.

731
00:38:53,820 --> 00:38:54,400
-Let's go!
-Let's go!

732
00:39:00,320 --> 00:39:00,800
Boss,

733
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:01,640
there's no one on the boat.

734
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:02,560
Boss,

735
00:39:02,640 --> 00:39:03,320
come and take a look!

736
00:39:07,600 --> 00:39:08,960
Madam Poison's black spider?

737
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:09,910
Oh mo.

738
00:39:10,320 --> 00:39:11,320
She's the one who told us that

739
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,280
the Phoenix Feather Token was taken by the owner of this pleasure boat.

740
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:15,040
It turns out this is a trap.

741
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:15,600
Let's go!

742
00:39:15,720 --> 00:39:16,640
Come with me to find her!

743
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:20,890
(Fengdu)

744
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:22,720
Is it beautiful? Look at this.

745
00:39:35,660 --> 00:39:36,240
Wu Chen,

746
00:39:36,720 --> 00:39:37,360
what's wrong?

747
00:39:39,190 --> 00:39:40,520
Have we...

748
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:43,670
been to this place before?

749
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,360
What did you say?

750
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:47,990
You've been here before?

751
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:51,100
I don't remember.

752
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,400
I remember now.

753
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:56,040
Doesn this place

754
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:58,920
look like the market in Mang Mountain?

755
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:05,700
Maybe all markets in the world

756
00:40:05,720 --> 00:40:06,740
are kind of the same.

757
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:08,230
Young Master Xie,

758
00:40:09,270 --> 00:40:10,810
you're more familiar with Fengdu City than we are.

759
00:40:10,840 --> 00:40:12,260
Where shall we stay tonight?

760
00:40:12,260 --> 00:40:12,490
(Huiyuan Pawn Shop)
Where shall we stay tonight?

761
00:40:12,490 --> 00:40:12,880
(Huiyuan Pawn Shop)

762
00:40:12,880 --> 00:40:14,090
The Beauties House, of course.
(Huiyuan Pawn Shop)

763
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:14,810
The Beauties House, of course.

764
00:40:14,880 --> 00:40:16,320
In Fengdu City, that's the most...

765
00:40:20,960 --> 00:40:23,310
Actually, there's a Lai Fu Inn up ahead; it's also good.

766
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,270
Young Sect Leader,

767
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,320
we'll go and make arrangements.

768
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,200
Take your time.

769
00:40:26,280 --> 00:40:26,840
Go ahead.

770
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:51,110
(Tianxing Mansion)

771
00:40:57,800 --> 00:40:59,460
What are you looking at?

772
00:41:00,250 --> 00:41:01,760
(Tianxing Mansion)

773
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,640
Tian...

774
00:41:04,660 --> 00:41:06,340
xing...

775
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:07,400
Mansion?

776
00:41:07,840 --> 00:41:09,640
Tianxing Mansion?

777
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,520
How grand.

778
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:11,880
(Tianxing Mansion)

779
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,560
Which official's residence is this?
(Tianxing Mansion)

780
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,960
Back in the day,

781
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:17,960
this was the residence of Feng Xingtian, the leader

782
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:19,520
of the once powerful Tianxing Sect.

783
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,880
Unfortunately, it has been vacant for so many years.

784
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,720
Times have changed.

785
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,680
What about the people who lived here?

786
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:28,520
Where did they all go?

787
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,400
Back then,

788
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,360
Feng Xingtian was...

789
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:36,680
His Tianxing Sect

790
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:38,250
encountered some issues,

791
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:39,450
which led to its destruction and scattering of its people.

792
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,440
Now,

793
00:41:40,600 --> 00:41:42,380
the Phoenix-masked Woman has returned to the martial arts world.

794
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:44,320
I wonder if this Tianxing Mansion

795
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:46,600
can regain its former glory.

796
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:48,730
What are you talking about?

797
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,040
Let's hurry to the inn.

798
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,840
I'm tired.

799
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:51,480
Let's go.
