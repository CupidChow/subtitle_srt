1
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,710
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,690
(Episode 4)

3
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:52,440
No way.

4
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:55,400
You mean sword flying?

5
00:01:56,270 --> 00:01:57,940
There's no path to the Snow Peak.

6
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:00,120
The only way up there is to fly.

7
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,200
But...

8
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:05,520
can this sword carry two people?

9
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:12,440
Get on.

10
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:20,760
Mo Xiao,

11
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,079
you really did it!

12
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:23,440
Don't be afraid.

13
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,240
Hold on tight.

14
00:02:24,280 --> 00:02:25,440
I'll keep you safe.

15
00:03:06,760 --> 00:03:07,600
Feng Xingtian!

16
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:10,000
You've been wounded by my Fengyue Sword.

17
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:11,960
If you let go of your obsession

18
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:13,040
and turn to the right path now,

19
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,040
Shushan Sect will overlook your challenge to the immortal sects,

20
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,400
and your Tianxing Sect

21
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,320
can find its place in the world.

22
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,640
Find its place?

23
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:24,640
Fengyue,

24
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,160
I never thought you'd look down on me like this.

25
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,160
What I, Feng Xingtian, want

26
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:31,440
is far more than just this!

27
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:33,540
Die!

28
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:40,240
Demonic magic?

29
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:41,470
Feng Xingtian!

30
00:03:41,960 --> 00:03:43,470
You've fallen into the demonic path.

31
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:22,079
Lixue,

32
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:22,920
we're here.

33
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,840
My master and your father are just up there.

34
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,080
Mo Xiao,

35
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:29,320
you're really amazing.

36
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:30,400
I've decided.

37
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,960
No matter who wins today—

38
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,080
your master or my father—

39
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:34,640
I'll join Xuanqing Court

40
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,520
and ask your master to teach me sword flying.

41
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,600
Okay.

42
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:39,080
I'll talk to my master for you.

43
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:42,360
Then we can be together every day.

44
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:44,920
Let's go then.

45
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:45,440
Let's go.

46
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:07,920
Dad!

47
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,520
Dad!

48
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,960
Dad!

49
00:05:39,159 --> 00:05:39,960
Dad!

50
00:06:05,770 --> 00:06:07,240
Grab my hand, quick!

51
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,200
Lixue!

52
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:12,140
Remember,

53
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:15,890
even if I have to be reborn as a ghost,

54
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,140
I'll come back

55
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,440
to take my revenge on you!

56
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,600
Lixue...

57
00:06:28,360 --> 00:06:29,200
No!

58
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:40,060
Lixue!

59
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:09,040
Mo Xiao?

60
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:50,320
Dad...

61
00:08:26,370 --> 00:08:27,550
With me here,

62
00:08:28,820 --> 00:08:30,040
you won't die.

63
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:38,280
(Sword Pavilion)

64
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:43,720
Sword Sovereign!

65
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,000
Sword Sovereign!

66
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:41,930
Sword Sovereign, you can't!

67
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:44,150
This is your guardian elixir,

68
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,080
containing your lifetime of cultivation.

69
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,840
How can you easily give it

70
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,280
to this little gatekeeper?

71
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:51,000
Why did you suddenly come here?

72
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:52,440
Is there something urgent?

73
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:54,640
For some unknown reason,

74
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:56,480
the seal of the Abyss of Infinity

75
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,800
suddenly showed signs of disturbance today.

76
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:00,760
Do you know

77
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:03,320
what caused my injuries when Feng Xingtian and I

78
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:04,860
fought at the Snow Peak?

79
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:07,960
Back then, Feng Xingtian

80
00:10:08,210 --> 00:10:09,440
betrayed the sect,

81
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:12,160
so he was expelled from the immortal sects and founded Tianxing Sect.

82
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:15,920
I thought he would live out his life as a mere mortal in the mortal world,

83
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:18,440
seeking fame and fortune.

84
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:21,000
But unexpectedly, when we fought today,

85
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,080
he actually used demonic magic.

86
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,160
It seems

87
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:26,080
he has long fallen into the demonic path.

88
00:10:26,830 --> 00:10:27,760
The demonic path?

89
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:30,240
Eight years ago,

90
00:10:30,290 --> 00:10:31,450
the Demon Lord, Yeyuan,

91
00:10:31,520 --> 00:10:33,880
led the demon army to attack Mount Buzhou to seize the token,

92
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,760
but he was defeated by you.

93
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,840
The Demon Sect has been silent for many years.

94
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:39,680
Could it be...

95
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,600
that their desire to seize the token has never died?

96
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:45,800
Eight years ago,

97
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:48,080
the seal of the Millennium Token Token was broken,

98
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:50,600
and some demonic power leaked out, which was taken by the Demon Sect.

99
00:10:50,930 --> 00:10:52,240
I never expected that now,

100
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:54,700
this demonic magic has been taken by Feng Xingtian.

101
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:56,720
There must be

102
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,920
someone behind him who is using him.

103
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,440
Sword Sovereign, you...

104
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,580
This demonic power is extremely strong.

105
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,860
If someone in the world

106
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:10,800
uses it to cultivate demonic magic,

107
00:11:11,130 --> 00:11:12,380
their own body

108
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:15,220
will surely suffer great backlash.

109
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:18,800
If Feng Xingtian has already been used by someone,

110
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:20,120
using his body as a vessel

111
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,600
for demonic power to fight me,

112
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:24,280
then it's likely

113
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,360
that in the future, more people like Feng Xingtian

114
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,640
will come to Shushan Sect

115
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:30,280
to seize the Millennium Token.

116
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:31,360
By then,

117
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,720
our Shushan Sect will be in danger.

118
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,960
Sword Sovereign, you need not worry too much.

119
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,480
Your Fengyue Sword Technique is already unmatched.

120
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,030
As long as you're here,

121
00:11:44,360 --> 00:11:46,920
Shushan Sect will surely be able to protect the Millennium Token.

122
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,240
Sword Sovereign!

123
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:15,240
Sword Sovereign,

124
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,740
This divine elixir

125
00:12:16,820 --> 00:12:18,360
was forged by Shushan Sword Immortal

126
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:20,920
only after reaching the Realm of Great Accomplishment.

127
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,800
Now that you're severely injured,

128
00:12:23,520 --> 00:12:26,850
why did you give this elixir to this insignificant boy?

129
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:28,270
What if...

130
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:30,680
If the demonic magic reappears in the world,

131
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:34,040
our disciples won't be able to resist it.

132
00:12:34,280 --> 00:12:36,100
Then Shushan Sect's duty will be hard to uphold.

133
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,340
You must think for Shushan Sect

134
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,520
and the people of the world,

135
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:41,320
Sword Sovereign!

136
00:12:44,750 --> 00:12:46,340
My time is almost up.

137
00:12:46,960 --> 00:12:47,760
What I did

138
00:12:49,110 --> 00:12:50,840
was precisely for Shushan Sect.

139
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:18,800
The child carries

140
00:13:18,830 --> 00:13:20,960
a strange power within him from birth.

141
00:13:20,980 --> 00:13:22,420
I've suppressed it for years,

142
00:13:22,960 --> 00:13:25,270
but today, his inner demon broke out.

143
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,860
If this power isn't guided by righteousness,

144
00:13:27,860 --> 00:13:28,870
(Sword Sovereign Haoxuan)
If this power isn't guided by righteousness,

145
00:13:28,870 --> 00:13:29,040
(Sword Sovereign Haoxuan)

146
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,420
it will one day bring disaster to the immortal sects.
(Sword Sovereign Haoxuan)

147
00:13:32,450 --> 00:13:35,160
Today, I used the divine elixir to seal this power

148
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:36,810
and passed on to him the Fengyue Sword Technique.

149
00:13:37,590 --> 00:13:39,820
After I meet my end in the future,

150
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:41,920
you must watch over his nature

151
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:43,920
and prevent his demonic nature from resurfacing.

152
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:46,390
If the calamity truly descends in the future,

153
00:13:46,740 --> 00:13:48,680
he will be my successor to turn the tide

154
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:51,210
and protect the Millennium Token.

155
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:54,430
Only you shall know of this.

156
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:56,710
You must not tell a second soul.

157
00:14:38,990 --> 00:14:40,530
Quick, give me your hand!

158
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:47,790
(Ten years later)

159
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,560
After ten years of seclusion,

160

(Yuan Beichen, Sect Leader of Shushan Sect)
After ten years of seclusion,

161

(Yuan Beichen, Sect Leader of Shushan Sect)

162

the time has come.
(Yuan Beichen, Sect Leader of Shushan Sect)

163
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:02,000
Ring the bell.

164
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,200
Yes!

Welcome, Sect Leader.
(Sword Pavilion)

176
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:59,430
Welcome, Sect Leader.

177
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:00,820
Pay respects to the sword!

178
00:17:42,270 --> 00:17:43,490
Give me my beetle!

179
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:48,840
Lingyun!

180
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:10,830
It has been ten years since the Sword Sovereign Fengyue

181

passed away.

00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:27,840
to witness the Fengyue Divine Sword leave seclusion.

189
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,080
Greetings, My Lord.

190
00:18:48,940 --> 00:18:51,030
Greetings, My Lord.

191
00:19:01,170 --> 00:19:02,610
Now that the Fengyue Sword has reappeared,

192
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,740
the next Sect Leader of Shushan Sect

193
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:09,610
should also be revealed today.

194
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,040
Sect Leader,

195
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,480
today is the sword ceremony,

196
00:19:13,960 --> 00:19:16,040
but you didn't mention anything

197
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:18,480
about appointing the successor to the position of Sect Leader.

198
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:19,840
Yes.

199
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,440
This matter was settled ten years ago.

200
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:27,440
Therefore, I did not discuss it with you.

201
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:28,880
Well,

202
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,210
who is the new Sect Leader?

203
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,400
The Fengyue Sword has reappeared,

204
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,160
and the Sword Immortal should return to their position.

205
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:41,680
Mo Xiao,

206
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:44,170
congratulations.

207
00:19:44,870 --> 00:19:46,530
You've come out of seclusion today.

208
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:08,550
Sect Leader.

209
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:09,580
Master.

210
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,770
(Mo Xiao, Young Sect Leader of Shushan Sect)

211
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:09,810
Master,

212
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,240
I have followed the Sword Sovereign's order

213
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,480
and been in seclusion for ten years.

214
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:13,520
I have overcome five tribulations

215
00:21:13,540 --> 00:21:14,840
and reached the Realm of Great Accomplishment.

216
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,640
Now, I have emerged from seclusion.

217
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:22,680
Good.

218
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,200
Great.

219
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:27,800
It's really good, Senior.

220
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:29,280
Ten years ago,

221
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:31,480
when the Sword Sovereign had just passed away,

222
00:21:31,730 --> 00:21:32,890
I was wondering

223
00:21:33,370 --> 00:21:34,630
if our Fengyue Sword

224
00:21:34,720 --> 00:21:37,400
would need to find a new master after ten years.

225
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,000
I didn't expect that

226
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:42,080
the Sword Sovereign had already made such an ingenious plan.

227
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:43,320
He has left us with

228
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:44,920
such an excellent successor for Shushan Sect.

229
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:46,920
Seeing him today,

230
00:21:47,160 --> 00:21:48,800
he is indeed a young talent.

231
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:50,560
This is truly a cause for celebration.

232
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:52,440
On that day, Master imparted to me Fengyue Sword Technique

233
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,680
and his lifetime of cultivation,

234
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,320
hoping I could inherit his will

235
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,700
and achieve enlightenment soon.

236
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:58,600
Now,

237
00:21:58,640 --> 00:21:59,960
after ten years of seclusion,

238
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:01,550
I have achieved some progress.

239
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,560
Sect Leader,

240
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,200
why have you kept

241
00:22:04,360 --> 00:22:05,760
such a major matter from us

242
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:06,960
for so long?

243
00:22:07,920 --> 00:22:09,760
It's not that I intentionally kept it a secret.

244
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,160
It was actually the Sword Sovereign's instruction

245
00:22:12,560 --> 00:22:14,960
that Mo Xiao's ten years of seclusion

246
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,200
should be without any distractions.

247
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:17,400
Therefore, this matter could only

248
00:22:17,560 --> 00:22:20,040
be revealed on the day he emerged from seclusion.

249
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:21,000
So, back then,

250
00:22:21,000 --> 00:22:23,000
when you selected Zifeng, Zimu, and Zisu from the three branches

251
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,160
and sent them to Xuanqing Court,

252
00:22:24,230 --> 00:22:25,800
claiming it was to guard the Sword Sovereign during cultivation,

253
00:22:25,920 --> 00:22:27,840
it was actually to guard Mo Xiao in seclusion, wasn't it?

254
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:28,560
Indeed.

255
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:31,920
The three guardians—Zisu, Zifeng, and Zimu—

256
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:34,760
accompanied Mo Xiao in seclusion for ten years,

257
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:36,120
guarding him day and night.

258
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:38,240
That too is a great merit.

259
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,900
Thank you, Sect Leader.

260
00:22:40,120 --> 00:22:40,840
However,

261
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:42,280
Sect Leader,

262
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,840
Mo Xiao has just emerged from seclusion.

263
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,920
Don't you think it's a bit too rushed to decide on him

264
00:22:47,370 --> 00:22:48,730
inheriting the position of Sect Leader today?

265
00:22:49,040 --> 00:22:49,800
Indeed.

266
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:52,020
Mo Xiao is indeed the Sword Sovereign's successor.

267
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:52,960
But...

268
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:54,800
the position of Sect Leader is of great importance.

269
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,480
Senior,

270
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:57,720
he's just an inexperienced young man.

271
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,880
Can he handle such a heavy responsibility and win everyone's hearts?

272
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,360
It's not something that can be settled

273
00:23:01,360 --> 00:23:02,520
just with your word.

274
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:03,800
Master,

275
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,080
the Uncle Masters are right.

276
00:23:06,200 --> 00:23:07,000
Junior,

277
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:08,720
say something.

278
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:10,440
Well...

279
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:12,920
Junior Xuan Zhen's personality…

280
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,880
Her carefree nature is really...

281
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:16,080
I give up.

282
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:17,040
What?

283
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:18,840
Do you disagree

284
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:20,960
with the Sword Sovereign's will?

285
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,040
Alright, alright,

286
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:24,800
Junior Xie.

287
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:26,160
Senior,

288
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,120
the Sword Sovereign had made this decision long ago.

289
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:28,960
It seems that

290
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,080
Junior and I

291
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,400
were overly worried.

292
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,800
From today onward,

293
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:47,880
Mo Xiao will be your Young Sect Leader

294
00:23:47,880 --> 00:23:49,160
and also the future successor to the position

295
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,080
of the Sect Leader of Shushan Sect.

296
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,840
Young Sect Leader, welcome from seclusion.

297
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:18,000
(Tiance Villa)

298
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:19,240
This place is not bad.
(Tiance Villa)

299
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:23,280
(Tiance Villa)

300
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,320
Young Sect Leader,
(Tiance Villa)

301
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,040
this is your private villa.

302
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:28,400
From now on, you will be living here.

303
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,120
Feel free to call me anytime if you need anything.

304
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:39,080
(Tiance Villa)

305
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,480
You three have accompanied me in cultivation at Xuanqing Court
(Tiance Villa)

306
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,400
for ten years
(Tiance Villa)

307
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:43,120
and haven't seen your fellow disciples in all those years.

308
00:24:43,270 --> 00:24:44,080
Now that you're back,

309
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:45,600
you can each go back and visit them.

310
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:48,440
Thank you, Young Sect Leader.

311
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,940
(Tiance Villa)

312
00:24:51,940 --> 00:24:53,910
Young Sect Leader is really kind to us.
(Tiance Villa)

313
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:56,180
Let's catch up with them later.

314
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,080
Young Master Xie.

315
00:24:59,640 --> 00:25:00,440
Mo Xiao,

316
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,680
you little brat.

317
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,840
When did you become Young Sect Leader of Shushan Sect?

318
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,280
Back at Xuanqing Court,

319
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,640
if I hadn't come up to keep you company every now and then,

320
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,400
you might have bored yourself to death.

321
00:25:11,030 --> 00:25:12,990
For the sake of me keeping you entertained,

322
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:15,120
don't tell anyone about me sneaking into

323
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,120
Xuanqing Court to catch beetles.

324
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,790
If my dad finds out,

325
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:20,940
he'll definitely give me a good thrashing with an iron whip.

326
00:25:20,970 --> 00:25:22,090
Are you sure you were there to keep me company,

327
00:25:22,110 --> 00:25:23,390
not to catch beetles?

328
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:23,680
Of course I was there to keep you company.

329
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,520
(Shushan Sect, Tielyv Branch)
(Xie Lingyun)
Of course I was there to keep you company.

330
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:25,680
There are plenty of places for me to catch beetles.
(Shushan Sect, Tielyv Branch)
(Xie Lingyun)
Of course I was there to keep you company.

331
00:25:25,680 --> 00:25:27,040
There are plenty of places for me to catch beetles.

332
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,680
Why did I have to go to your Xuanqing Court?

333
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:31,120
Could it be that the beetles in our Xuanqing Court

334
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,160
are the most powerful?

335
00:25:32,160 --> 00:25:32,640
You...

336
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:35,160
You thick-headed,

337
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:36,960
socially clueless fool.

338
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:38,440
You're not as clever as I am.

339
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,280
As for looks,

340
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,720
you're not as handsome and charming as I am.

341
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,000
And you're timid.

342
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:44,200
You don't even dare to catch beetles.

343
00:25:44,360 --> 00:25:46,240
And you're not as familiar with the four branches of Shushan Sect as I am.

344
00:25:46,520 --> 00:25:47,840
I just don't get it.

345
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,200
Why did Sect Leader insist on

346
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,920
making you the Young Sect Leader?

347
00:25:51,920 --> 00:25:52,840
There's no why.

348
00:25:52,870 --> 00:25:54,550
It's just that it's the Sword Sovereign's will.

349
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:55,360
Fine.

350
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,120
The Sword Sovereign was the boss, and you're the greatest.

351
00:25:57,120 --> 00:25:57,880
Happy now?

352
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:58,760
Oh right.

353
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:00,080
Where's your beetle?

354
00:26:01,130 --> 00:26:02,050
Don't even mention it.

355
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,400
I ran into a jerk today

356
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,080
who flicked my Armor away.

357
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:07,000
-You have no idea...
-Who are you calling a jerk?

358
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,000
The sword ceremony

359
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,400
was an incredibly grand event,

360
00:26:10,560 --> 00:26:12,080
and you were playing with a beetle there.

361
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:13,200
And you actually had the nerve to mention it?

362
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:14,960
Young Sect Leader,

363
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:18,320
how should we punish someone like him

364
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:19,160
who disregards the rules?

365
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:22,080
Who is this?

366
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,600
Brother Mo Xiao,

367
00:26:25,000 --> 00:26:25,600
(Shushan Sect, Fengyu Branch)
(Murong Jing)

368
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:27,000
don't you remember me?
(Shushan Sect, Fengyu Branch)
(Murong Jing)

369
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:27,640
(Shushan Sect, Fengyu Branch)
(Murong Jing)

370
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:28,880
I'm Jing.
(Shushan Sect, Fengyu Branch)
(Murong Jing)

371
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:30,960
Jing?

372
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,480
Mo Xiao, let me introduce her.

373
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,120
She is Murong Jing, the Young Master of Fengyu Branch,

374
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,440
the most unruly

375
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,680
and unreasonable girl in Shushan Sect.

376
00:26:38,700 --> 00:26:40,200
Who are you calling an unreasonable girl?

377
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:41,200
You, of course.

378
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:42,040
Let me tell you,

379
00:26:42,040 --> 00:26:44,120
you must compensate me for my beetle.

380
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,800
I put in a lot of effort to find it

381
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,880
on the Cliff Peak of Xuanqing Court.

382
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,760
Xuanqing Court?

383
00:26:50,180 --> 00:26:51,740
Oh, you!

384
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,750
Xuanqing Court is a forbidden area.

385
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,640
-How dare you…
-What?

386
00:26:55,660 --> 00:26:56,990
Don't think I don't know.

387
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,500
You've secretly been there too.

388
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:02,720
I only went to the back mountain to practice sword flying.

389
00:27:03,210 --> 00:27:05,130
I didn't intend to disturb Brother Mo Xiao's cultivation.

390
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:05,920
Alright then.

391
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,760
Then go up there by sword flying again

392
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,120
and catch two beetles for me.

393
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,570
Otherwise, I'll tell Sect Leader.

394
00:27:11,690 --> 00:27:13,480
I'm used to getting whipped anyway.

395
00:27:13,480 --> 00:27:14,600
One more time won't make a difference.

396
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:15,840
But you,

397
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,400
Miss Murong,

398
00:27:17,960 --> 00:27:19,440
-by then...
-Brother Mo Xiao,

399
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:20,520
look at him!

400
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,480
Stop making noise at my door.

401
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,640
It's time for my midday lessons.

402
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,650
Oh, right.

403
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,520
I'll have Blackie and Whitey

404
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,520
catch your mechanical beetle back for you.

405
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:32,440
Blackie and Whitey?

406
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,280
Mo Xiao!

407
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:41,400
Brother Mo Xiao!

408
00:27:54,280 --> 00:27:55,080
Mo Xiao,

409
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:57,600
this is a treasure I've been saving for a long time.

410
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,000
Since you've come out of seclusion today,

411
00:27:59,000 --> 00:27:59,720
I'm giving it to you

412
00:27:59,720 --> 00:28:00,960
as a congratulatory gift.

413
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,160
However,

414
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,280
I have a small request.

415
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:05,560
According to my prediction,

416
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:06,360
within half a month,

417
00:28:06,360 --> 00:28:08,720
the Sect Leader will definitely send you down the mountain for your trial.

418
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,080
By then, tell him you want to take me with you.

419
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:11,880
What do you say?

420
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,800
If you don't want it,

421
00:28:16,080 --> 00:28:17,490
I'll be leaving.

422
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:45,570
Snow?

423
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:46,600
It's snowing?

424
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:47,440
What's going on?

425
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:48,410
Why are there snowflakes?

426
00:28:55,330 --> 00:28:56,160
A monster!

427
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:56,960
Hurry! Hurry!

428
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:57,940
Run!

429
00:28:58,240 --> 00:28:59,500
Chief, run!

430
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:00,670
Run!

431
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:10,160
A Snow Demon has appeared in Mang Mountain.

432
00:29:10,560 --> 00:29:13,520
We humbly request Shushan Sect to subdue it.

433
00:29:16,320 --> 00:29:17,760
The Snow Demon of Mang Mountain?

434
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,640
What?

435
00:29:26,870 --> 00:29:28,320
A Snow Demon is wreaking havoc?

436
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:29,990
The report says that

437
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:31,280
this Snow Demon of Mang Mountain

438
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:33,680
has already destroyed countless farmlands at the foot of the mountain

439
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,150
and harmed many villagers.

440
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,760
The most urgent task now

441
00:29:39,990 --> 00:29:41,670
is to eliminate this demon.

442
00:29:42,340 --> 00:29:44,260
Who should we send this time?

443
00:29:45,180 --> 00:29:46,180
How about

444
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:48,800
letting that little brat of mine take this as a training opportunity?

445
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:52,680
Your Tielyv Branch is in charge of Shushan's punishments and prison.

446
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:54,040
If the demon is subdued,

447
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:56,720
it will be detained and watched by your Tielyv Branch.

448
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,880
This is a great responsibility.

449
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,930
Speaking of subduing demons,

450
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:03,280
I actually have someone in mind who would be perfect for the task.

451
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,060
Mo Xiao?

452
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,000
Exactly.

453
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:28,560
(Peace and Prosperity)

454
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:29,080
Immortal Master,
(Peace and Prosperity)

455
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,840
come, come!
(Peace and Prosperity)

456
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,300
-Immortal Master.
-Yes.

457
00:33:31,330 --> 00:33:32,080
The Immortal Master is here.

458
00:33:34,560 --> 00:33:36,070
This Immortal Master saved us.

459
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:37,440
Thanks to this Immortal Master.

460
00:33:37,470 --> 00:33:38,500
Impressive.

461
00:33:40,210 --> 00:33:41,330
It's all thanks to him.

462
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:44,070
If it weren't for him, we would have been doomed.

463
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:45,490
What are you doing here?

464
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,200
Thank you, Immortal Master, for subduing the demon

465
00:33:48,480 --> 00:33:50,440
and protecting the lives of all living beings in this area.

466
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,000
This is

467
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,920
truly a blessing from heaven.

468
00:33:54,940 --> 00:33:55,660
Indeed.

469
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:57,000
Thank you, Immortal Master.

470
00:33:57,390 --> 00:33:59,870
Thank you, Immortal Master. Thank you, Immortal Master.

471
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,150
There's no need to thank me, Elder.

472
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,160
Demon subduing

473
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:03,920
is the duty of every disciple of Shushan Sect.

474
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:04,960
It's nothing worth mentioning.

475
00:34:11,040 --> 00:34:11,679
Elder,

476
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:13,639
if there's anything troubling you,

477
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:16,880
feel free to tell me.

478
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,239
Immortal Master,

479
00:34:18,679 --> 00:34:20,400
our paddy fields have been destroyed

480
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,290
by the Snow Demon.

481
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:24,790
As a result, the snow can't melt

482
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:26,889
and our crops

483
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,520
won't survive.

484
00:34:29,110 --> 00:34:32,270
This way, we'll have no harvest this year.

485
00:34:32,659 --> 00:34:35,159
Yes, Immortal Master.

486
00:34:36,469 --> 00:34:38,030
Then what should we do about this?

487
00:34:41,270 --> 00:34:42,070
Immortal Master,

488
00:34:42,090 --> 00:34:44,580
if the villagers lose their food supply,

489
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:46,480
even without the Snow Demon,

490
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,940
we'll still die.

491
00:34:48,969 --> 00:34:49,650
Yes, Immortal Master.

492
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:51,000
We really have no food left.

493
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,480
Please save us!

494
00:34:52,500 --> 00:34:53,659
Save us, please!

495
00:34:53,690 --> 00:34:55,130
-Please!
-Please save us, Immortal Master!

496
00:34:55,239 --> 00:34:56,040
Chief,

497
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,000
please get up.

498
00:34:57,640 --> 00:34:58,680
Folks, please get up.

499
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:03,820
My cultivation is still shallow,

500
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:06,050
and I might not be able to bring the dead back to life.

501
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:07,290
But I promise you,

502
00:35:07,320 --> 00:35:08,320
I promise all of you,

503
00:35:08,340 --> 00:35:09,380
that I will do my best,

504
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,470
using my inner energy to melt the ice and snow

505
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,200
and save some of the crops.

506
00:35:13,660 --> 00:35:16,810
Thank you, Immortal Master, for your immense benevolence!

507
00:35:16,830 --> 00:35:19,560
Thank you, Immortal Master, for your immense benevolence!

508
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:22,820
Thank you, Immortal Master, for your immense benevolence!

509
00:35:24,220 --> 00:35:25,770
Thank you, Immortal Master!

510
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,040
Chief.

511
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:48,920
It really melted!

512
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:50,240
Look!

513
00:36:14,280 --> 00:36:15,320
It really melted!

514
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:16,040
Look over there!

515
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:16,880
It's all melted.

516
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,760
This is great.

517
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,040
It's all melted.

518
00:36:54,060 --> 00:36:54,880
It's all melted now!

519
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:55,760
We have food now.

520
00:36:57,960 --> 00:37:01,320
Thank you, Immortal Master, for your great kindness!

521
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,280
Thank you, Immortal Master, for your great kindness!

522
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:06,080
Thank you, Immortal Master!

523
00:38:55,180 --> 00:38:55,980
Snowy,

524
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:58,970
if he doesn't wake up soon,

525
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,360
he might need another Lingzhi.

526
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,040
Never mind.

527
00:39:04,120 --> 00:39:04,430
I'll go with you.

528
00:39:04,430 --> 00:39:05,480
(Wu Chen, an orphan in Mang Mountain)
I'll go with you.

529
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:05,720
(Wu Chen, an orphan in Mang Mountain)

530
00:39:05,720 --> 00:39:07,480
So you won't be bullied by snow wolves.
(Wu Chen, an orphan in Mang Mountain)

531
00:39:08,280 --> 00:39:09,080
Let's go.

532
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:17,880
The Snow Demon has been eliminated,

533
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:19,000
and the demonic spell has been broken,

534
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,600
but the Immortal Master hasn't returned yet.

535
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,640
Could something have happened to him?

536
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:24,920
What could possibly have happened?

537
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,680
The Immortal Master's cultivation is profound.

538
00:39:26,880 --> 00:39:28,680
The Snow Demon has caused havoc in Mang Mountain for a long time,

539
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,600
but the Immortal Master was able to defeat it in one battle.

540
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:32,360
What could possibly be holding him back?

541
00:39:32,760 --> 00:39:33,880
That's true.

542
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:36,400
I'm afraid there are still remnants

543
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,760
of the Snow Demon's followers in Mang Mountain's snowfields.

544
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,240
Go.

545
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,120
Tell Wu Da and Liu Er

546
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:44,400
to go up the mountain and search carefully.

547
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,040
Yes.

548
00:40:01,230 --> 00:40:02,280
Snowy,

549
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,400
slow down.

550
00:40:10,920 --> 00:40:12,440
I know you're hungry.

551
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:14,760
But...

552
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,960
you'll have two fewer today.

553
00:40:18,340 --> 00:40:19,820
I'll also have two fewer.

554
00:40:20,700 --> 00:40:22,340
This is yours.

555
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,520
This is mine.

556
00:40:26,350 --> 00:40:27,910
The rest

557
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:29,190
are for him.

558
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,720
He's injured,

559
00:40:30,740 --> 00:40:32,140
so he needs to eat more.

560
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:36,080
You're mad just because of this?

561
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:38,760
Have you forgotten that when you were injured last time,

562
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,680
I gave you all the wild fruits?

563
00:40:46,170 --> 00:40:47,760
So you agreed?

564
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:48,640
Good girl.

565
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,440
I'll let you eat first.

566
00:40:55,130 --> 00:40:56,370
You can't do this.

567
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,740
You're being greedy again.

568
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,910
Didn't we agree

569
00:40:59,960 --> 00:41:01,700
that you can eat one every hour?

570
00:41:01,840 --> 00:41:03,120
If you eat too much now,

571
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:04,840
you'll be hungry later.
