00:01:31,120 --> 00:01:35,710
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,759
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:40,880
Innkeeper,

4
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,160
I'll take all the rooms in your inn.

5
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,280
Sir,

6
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,880
we don't need that many rooms.

7
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:47,920
Sir,

8
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:50,640
this inn has more than 20 rooms.

9
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,039
Do you want them all?

10
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:52,920
Yes, all of them.

11
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,880
Sir,

12
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:57,720
if you'd like to book all the rooms,

13
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,440
the total cost will be fifty taels of silver.

14
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:01,720
He'll pay.

15
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,920
I'll pay?

16
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:03,840
Mo Xiao,

17
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,080
you're booking so many rooms and expect me to foot the bill?

18
00:02:06,160 --> 00:02:06,640
You!

19
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,250
Mo Xiao,

20
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,360
last time you spent a whole bag of golden leaves from me.

21
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:26,140
Today, you've reserved the entire inn.

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,960
Even if the money isn't yours,

23
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:29,920
there's no need to make such a grand show of it, right?

24
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,079
We have guests tonight.

25
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:32,480
I'm afraid they'll disturb us.

26
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:33,280
Guests?

27
00:02:33,370 --> 00:02:33,920
Who?

28
00:02:34,079 --> 00:02:34,800
You didn't tell me.

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:36,360
Uninvited guests.

30
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,120
Zisu,

31
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,000
you three wait here for a moment.

32
00:02:45,079 --> 00:02:45,840
Young Sect Leader.

33
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:48,079
You three are new to Fengdu City.

34
00:02:48,320 --> 00:02:50,440
How about letting Young Master Xie show you around?

35
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,900
Really?

36
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:53,850
When it comes to the best places in Fengdu City,

37
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:55,200
no one knows them better than I do.

38
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:56,520
Ask Wu Chen and Jing to join us.

39
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:57,120
Let's go.

40
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:59,560
-We're here.
-Young Master Xie.

41
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,920
You two arrived just in time.

42
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,600
Let's go.

43
00:03:05,320 --> 00:03:05,880
Mo Xiao,

44
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,800
aren't you coming?

45
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,280
Yeah, Young Sect Leader.

46
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:10,280
You should come along too.

47
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:11,080
I'll pass.

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:11,840
I still have a training session tonight.

49
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,880
Alright,

50
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:13,960
let's not worry about him.

51
00:03:14,200 --> 00:03:14,680
Let's go have fun.

52
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,340
Let's go.

53
00:03:16,130 --> 00:03:16,730
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

54
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,710
Look over there.

55
00:03:36,079 --> 00:03:36,680
Let me give it a try.

56
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:37,480
What is this?

57
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,180
(The Elixir Shop)

58
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:56,460
(Yifeng House)

59
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:02,700
Hey, little rabbit.

60
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:06,430
Hey, little rabbit.

61
00:04:10,660 --> 00:04:11,740
Hey, little rabbit.

62
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,000
(Soaring With Grand Ambitions)

63
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,410
Great Guardian,
(Soaring With Grand Ambitions)

64
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,510
the Sect Leader has been gone for many years.

65
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,340
We've settled down in Fengdu City

66
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:31,050
(Snow Crowns the Cang Mountains)
We've settled down in Fengdu City

67
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,240
(Snow Crowns the Cang Mountains)

68
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:33,640
and have grown accustomed to living as ordinary people.
(Snow Crowns the Cang Mountains)

69
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:35,560
Great Guardian, it's been years since we last saw you.

70
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:36,640
Now that you're here

71
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,370
and have gathered us all,

72
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:40,240
we wonder what the reason is.

73
00:04:42,550 --> 00:04:44,280
Ordinary people?

74
00:04:49,930 --> 00:04:51,530
Once you join the Tianxing Sect,

75
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,110
you follow the Sect Leader for life.

76
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:54,610
What?

77
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:54,790
(Snow Crowns the Cang Mountains)
What?

78
00:04:54,790 --> 00:04:55,440
(Snow Crowns the Cang Mountains)

79
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,800
Did you forget the oath you swore
(Snow Crowns the Cang Mountains)

80
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:58,360
(Snow Crowns the Cang Mountains)

81
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,760
in front of the Sect Leader back then?
(Snow Crowns the Cang Mountains)

82
00:04:59,760 --> 00:05:00,680
(Snow Crowns the Cang Mountains)

83
00:05:00,680 --> 00:05:02,010
I haven't forgotten,
(Snow Crowns the Cang Mountains)

84
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:02,480
but...

85
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,750
But the Sect Leader is dead.

86
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:05,960
We, the followers of the sect,

87
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,600
were scattered by Shushan.

88
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,010
Even if they hadn't scattered us,

89
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:10,610
what could we have done?

90
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:11,680
Even though the Sect Leader is no longer here,

91
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:13,040
the Young Miss is still around.

92
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:14,560
For decades,

93
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:16,280
I have been searching for her whereabouts.

94
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,870
Once she returns,

95
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:21,440
the Tianxing Sect will surely be revived.

96
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:24,580
Hard work pays off,

97
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:27,010
and that day has finally come.

98
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:28,680
Young Miss is returning

99
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,360
to unlock the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

100
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,200
Everything of the Tianxing Sect is still here.

101
00:05:34,510 --> 00:05:36,280
To welcome her back,

102
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,510
I'll first take care of

103
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,090
you traitors who have betrayed the sect.

104
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,400
Great Guardian.

105
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:53,960
Young Miss.

106
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:57,020
Since you're aware I'm still around,

107
00:05:57,890 --> 00:06:00,720
what makes you the one to punish them?

108
00:06:01,480 --> 00:06:02,960
I, Po Yun, lead the followers of the Tianxing Sect

109
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,080
to pay our respects to you, Young Miss.

110
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,850
We pay our respects to you, Young Miss.

111
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,410
Young Miss, your return

112
00:06:07,430 --> 00:06:08,830
must be the Sect Leader's blessing from above,

113
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,280
ensuring the Tianxing Sect's survival.

114
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:13,660
Ensuring the Tianxing Sect's survival?

115
00:06:14,920 --> 00:06:17,040
My father was killed by Shushan years ago,

116
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,040
and my vengeance still lingers.

117
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:22,250
How can I uphold my dignity?

118
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:22,920
Young Miss.

119
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:24,330
For years, I've been

120
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,880
searching for you.

121
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:27,560
As long as you're safe,

122
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:28,940
we will obey your every command

123
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:30,720
when it comes to avenging the Sect Leader.

124
00:06:36,190 --> 00:06:37,540
And you?

125
00:06:37,560 --> 00:06:38,980
Please spare me, Young Miss!

126
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,330
I never intended to betray the sect.

127
00:06:41,550 --> 00:06:43,409
After the Sect Leader's death,

128
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:45,360
Shushan disbanded us,

129
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,159
and we had no choice but to find another way.

130
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,040
Young Miss,

131
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:50,840
I will take care of the traitors for you.

132
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:51,520
Wait!

133
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:53,770
We shouldn't be

134
00:06:53,840 --> 00:06:55,640
killing our own people right now.

135
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:00,670
Young Miss,

136
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:02,010
are you saying

137
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,360
you want to kill the Sword Sovereign Fengyue?

138
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,000
The Sword Sovereign Fengyue is already dead.

139
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:11,080
But his disciple still remains, namely

140
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:12,350
Mo

141
00:07:12,370 --> 00:07:13,050
Xiao.

142
00:07:14,620 --> 00:07:16,510
We shall follow your orders, Young Miss,

143
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,780
and gladly face death if necessary.

144
00:07:19,970 --> 00:07:22,670
(Fortune Inn)

145
00:07:54,340 --> 00:07:55,560
You're finally here.

146
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,590
You were waiting for me?

147
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,160
I've been waiting for a long time.

148
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,190
You claimed to be

149
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,280
the disciple of Sword Sovereign Fengyue,

150
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,240
and even took the Phoenix Feather Token.

151
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,630
So it was all

152
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,760
just to lure me out?

153
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:10,520
That's right.

154
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:13,720
But then you pulled a diversion

155
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,910
and led everyone who was after the token

156
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,560
straight to Madam Poison.

157
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:20,000
Mo Xiao,

158
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:22,990
you used to seem so slow and clueless.

159
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,880
Who would've thought

160
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:26,400
you'd turn out to be so cunning?

161
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,610
You're such a fool.

162
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,050
You may have appeared dull,

163
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,960
but your mind is sharp.

164
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:37,760
So you truly are Feng Lixue?

165
00:08:39,270 --> 00:08:40,299
How do you prove it?

166
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,140
Prove it?

167
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,440
Killing you

168
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:49,400
is all the proof I need!

169
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:53,840
The Phoenix Feather Chain!

170
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:55,000
Stop right there!

171
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,800
You went through all this trouble to lure me out,

172
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:15,160
just to kill me?

173
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,230
For my father's death and the downfall of my sect,

174
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:19,440
killing you alone won't be enough to quench my hatred.

175
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,900
If you wish to kill me as an act of revenge,

176
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,400
there's no need to involve so many innocent people.

177
00:09:25,110 --> 00:09:26,300
Without involving them, how else could I

178
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:26,760
(Wine House)
Without involving them, how else could I

179
00:09:26,760 --> 00:09:26,880
(Wine House)

180
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,160
have lured you out, the sword immortal of the Shushan Sect?
(Wine House)

181
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:31,000
As for Feng Xingtian's death,

182
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,280
there's more to the story than you're aware of.

183
00:09:33,080 --> 00:09:34,520
I haven't uncovered all the facts yet.

184
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:35,990
If you truly are Feng Lixue,

185
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,280
once I uncover everything,

186
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:38,250
I'll give you the answers you seek.

187
00:09:38,280 --> 00:09:39,960
Stop pretending.

188
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:42,040
I'm no longer the Feng Lixue I once was.

189
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:44,040
I've returned for revenge.

190
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,380
Those blinded by greed

191
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,100
will pay with their lives, along with you.

192
00:09:49,460 --> 00:09:50,940
Go to hell!

193
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:41,790
Mo Xiao.

194
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:42,940
-Young Sect Leader.
-Young Sect Leader.

195
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:43,880
Your hand...

196
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:45,760
I'm fine.

197
00:10:46,840 --> 00:10:47,400
Where's Wu Chen?

198
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:48,280
Wu Chen?

199
00:10:49,210 --> 00:10:49,800
She...

200
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:51,520
She didn't come with us.

201
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,290
I thought she had already returned ahead of us.

202
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,040
What did you say?

203
00:10:57,330 --> 00:11:02,640
(Yifeng House)

204
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:04,240
Eat up.

205
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,380
Miss, are you done looking?

206
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:06,810
I'm closing up.

207
00:11:06,840 --> 00:11:07,720
Please come back tomorrow.

208
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,920
Have we met before?

209
00:11:25,950 --> 00:11:28,340
You actually came here with him?

210
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:30,200
That's perfect.

211
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:33,000
I'll deal with

212
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:35,640
both of you together.

213
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:06,000
(Wine House)

214
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:08,120
Wu Chen.

215
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:13,720
Wu Chen.

216
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,740
(Taihe Fabrics)

217
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:33,240
(Craft Shop)

218
00:12:34,450 --> 00:12:36,200
(Tianxing Mansion)

219
00:12:41,210 --> 00:12:42,500
(Tianxing Mansion)

220
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:52,030
(The Elixir Shop)

221
00:12:52,140 --> 00:12:52,740
Wu Chen.

222
00:12:54,360 --> 00:12:54,880
Wu Chen.

223
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,240
Wu Chen, wake up.

224
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:57,560
Wu Chen.

225
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,620
Mo Xiao.

226
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,450
Are you alright?

227
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,890
How did I fall asleep?

228
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,760
Where am I?

229
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:12,590
You really can sleep anywhere, huh?

230
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,360
Don't you know how dangerous that is?

231
00:13:14,920 --> 00:13:17,360
I was about to head back to the inn

232
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,520
but I ran into a very strange person.

233
00:13:21,010 --> 00:13:21,810
A strange person?

234
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,760
She was wearing a mask.

235
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:27,640
I couldn't see her face clearly.

236
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:30,880
But she looked familiar.

237
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,880
I think I've seen her before,

238
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:36,280
but I can't remember anything beyond that.

239
00:13:36,400 --> 00:13:37,480
A person wearing a mask?

240
00:13:38,090 --> 00:13:40,140
When you were heading back to the Demon Subduing Palace
of the Shushan Sect,

241
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,840
you mentioned

242
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,390
seeing someone wearing a mask.

243
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,130
Is it the same person?

244
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,290
It doesn't seem like him.

245
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,400
Their masks are different.

246
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,160
Alright.

247
00:13:49,790 --> 00:13:51,110
No matter who you saw,

248
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:52,620
the important thing is that you're not hurt.

249
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,280
But remember, don't wander off like that again.

250
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,270
You need to stay with me.

251
00:13:56,840 --> 00:14:00,560
You were the one who kicked us out tonight.

252
00:14:05,270 --> 00:14:06,730
I was wrong today.

253
00:14:07,950 --> 00:14:08,950
It won't happen again.

254
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:13,040
Let's go.

255
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,780
What's wrong?

256
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,160
My legs are numb.

257
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:22,210
Let me carry you on my back.

258
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:33,800
Wu Chen.

259
00:14:34,730 --> 00:14:35,610
Where's your family?

260
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:37,040
Have you given it any thought?

261
00:14:37,640 --> 00:14:38,680
Family?

262
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,960
I've always been on my own up on Mang Mountain.

263
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:45,800
If I were to speak of family,

264
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,100
it would be Snowy.

265
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,520
Before that,

266
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:51,240
who were you?

267
00:14:51,740 --> 00:14:52,810
Have you ever thought about it?

268
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:56,610
Why should I think about that?

269
00:15:01,960 --> 00:15:02,520
You're right.

270
00:15:03,240 --> 00:15:04,240
Why even bother thinking about it?

271
00:15:05,020 --> 00:15:06,170
It'll only give you more headaches.

272
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:34,640
You're here as well?

273
00:15:36,730 --> 00:15:38,330
I've come to deliver the Supreme Lord's orders.

274
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,160
He is your Supreme Lord.

275
00:15:42,680 --> 00:15:43,960
What right does he have to command me?

276
00:15:44,040 --> 00:15:45,560
The Supreme Lord sent me to remind you

277
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,770
that your presence here

278
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:49,680
is part of his plan.

279
00:15:50,230 --> 00:15:51,110
Yet, you were so quick

280
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,320
to seek revenge on Mo Xiao.

281
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:56,220
The Supreme Lord has shown leniency for your first offense.

282
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,360
But if you dare repeat it,

283
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,720
you'll never have to appear again.

284
00:16:03,760 --> 00:16:05,200
He thinks

285
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,000
he can control me?

286
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:10,920
Go back and tell Chongguang

287
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,640
I'll keep my word.

288
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,480
For the past ten years,

289
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:19,000
nothing has stopped me from doing what I want.

290
00:16:20,280 --> 00:16:20,760
Oh,

291
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,650
by the way, that Wu Chen,

292
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,080
she doesn't know a thing.

293
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,400
She's probably the hardest one to control, don't you think?

294
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,550
You don't need to worry about Wu Chen.

295
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:32,000
You'd better mind your own behavior.

296
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:45,320
Young Miss.

297
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,000
You're following me?

298
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,000
I wouldn't dare.

299
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,330
I'm just concerned for your safety

300
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:51,640
and want to stay by your side to protect you.

301
00:16:53,650 --> 00:16:54,520
Is that so?

302
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:57,260
Aren't you suspicious

303
00:16:57,440 --> 00:16:59,680
about whether I'm the real Feng Lixue or not?

304
00:17:00,670 --> 00:17:02,440
I've never doubted you, Young Miss.

305
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:03,550
It's just that

306
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:05,720
there are things I've been too hesitant to ask.

307
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,119
For the past ten years,

308
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,680
where have you been, Young Miss?

309
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:09,800
How have you been living?

310
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:12,119
Now that you're back, do you have any plans?

311
00:17:12,260 --> 00:17:13,940
Are you asking me

312
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:16,560
to give you a detailed account?

313
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:18,800
I wouldn't dare.

314
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,040
I'm just worried about you, Young Miss.

315
00:17:22,010 --> 00:17:22,810
After all,

316
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:25,790
I failed to protect you 10 years ago.

317
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:26,440
Enough!

318
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,040
There's no need to bring up the past.

319
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:31,160
I'm no longer the Feng Lixue I used to be.

320
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,320
You have my word, Young Miss.

321
00:17:33,080 --> 00:17:34,130
From now on,

322
00:17:34,600 --> 00:17:35,680
as long as I'm alive,

323
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,240
no harm will ever come to you.

324
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,920
Then carry out what I told you,

325
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:51,080
without any mistakes.

326
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:52,280
Yes.

327
00:17:59,300 --> 00:18:00,370
Young Miss

328
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:03,050
can now interact physically with ordinary people.

329
00:18:03,550 --> 00:18:04,810
That strange cold condition she had

330
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,370
has been cured.

331
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:10,410
(Fortune Inn)

332
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:12,640
Mo Xiao,

333
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,080
you've finally returned.

334
00:18:18,560 --> 00:18:19,460
Wu Chen,

335
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,280
what's wrong with you?

336
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,960
Are you hurt?

337
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,020
No, I'm not.

338
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,160
Then why did you let Mo Xiao carry you?

339
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:25,960
And

340
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:27,480
do you realize that because you wandered off again,

341
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:29,310
we had such a hard time finding you?

342
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:30,960
I didn't wander off.

343
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,650
Weren't you the ones who left me behind?

344
00:18:33,800 --> 00:18:35,280
Aren't you worried I might run into danger

345
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:36,880
or actually get lost?

346
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,880
It was all Xie Lingyun's fault.

347
00:18:43,040 --> 00:18:44,730
He wouldn't stop talking, and I got so distracted

348
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,440
that I didn't even notice you'd fallen behind.

349
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:49,710
Anyway, I'm just glad you're okay.

350
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,260
Be more careful next time.

351
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:52,160
Got it.

352
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:52,960
Alright then.

353
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:54,400
We've got a long journey tomorrow.

354
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:55,920
Let's get some rest.

355
00:18:57,810 --> 00:18:59,490
I've prepared the room for you.

356
00:18:59,640 --> 00:19:00,400
You must be exhausted from the journey.

357
00:19:00,420 --> 00:19:01,440
Come on, let's go get some rest.

358
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,120
Let's go.

359
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:08,160
With Jing's limited intelligence,

360
00:19:08,530 --> 00:19:10,470
I suppose she can't handle Wu Chen anymore.

361
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,280
But we can't blame her.

362
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:14,950
Wu Chen's progress has just been too fast.

363
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:38,420
Mo Xiao.

364
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,340
You deliberately sent us away tonight, didn't you?

365
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,040
Yes.

366
00:19:42,090 --> 00:19:44,220
You knew the Phoenix-masked Woman would come.

367
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:46,080
She used the Phoenix Feather Token to lure me out.

368
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:47,280
Of course she would come to see me.

369
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:48,840
Then why did you send us away?

370
00:19:50,050 --> 00:19:51,710
Because her target was only me.

371
00:19:51,800 --> 00:19:53,200
That's not cool of you to say.

372
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:54,680
Are we still friends or not?

373
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,080
If she wants to harm you,

374
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,480
it's the same as harming me.

375
00:19:57,840 --> 00:19:59,320
Luckily, we came back in time.

376
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:00,680
If anything had happened to you,

377
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:02,360
how would we explain it to the Sect Leader?

378
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:07,600
Actually, she lured me out this time

379
00:20:07,920 --> 00:20:09,000
to confirm something else too.

380
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:09,600
What's that?

381
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:11,480
Whether she's really Feng Lixue.

382
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:12,960
And?

383
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,160
Is she or isn't she?

384
00:20:30,990 --> 00:20:33,310
How can both of them bear the Phoenix-shaped mark?

385
00:20:34,430 --> 00:20:36,480
How can there be two Feng Lixues in existence?

386
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:40,720
Mo Xiao.

387
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,200
Wu Chen.

388
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:42,710
I heard you were injured.

389
00:20:43,120 --> 00:20:44,240
It's just a minor injury. Nothing to worry about.

390
00:20:44,580 --> 00:20:45,460
Where is it?

391
00:20:46,560 --> 00:20:47,350
Here.

392
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,080
Look.

393
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:49,040
I've already applied medicine to it.

394
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,280
That won't do.

395
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,350
Wu Chen, let go.

396
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,560
Wu Chen.

397
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,690
Wu Chen, let go quickly.

398
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,400
What are you two doing?

399
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:15,320
(Fortune Inn)

400
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,010
Young Sect Leader,

401
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,640
we've decided to abandon the previous pleasure boat

402
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:21,370
and travel via the official road, which isn't suitable for sword flying.

403
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:22,610
To reach Peach Blossom Village as soon as possible,

404
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,060
we've arranged for a few horses.

405
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:24,290
(Fortune Inn)
we've arranged for a few horses.

406
00:21:24,290 --> 00:21:24,320
(Fortune Inn)

407
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,960
However, there aren't many good steeds in the stable.
(Fortune Inn)

408
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:26,040
(Fortune Inn)

409
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:27,380
We've only managed to get four horses,
(Fortune Inn)

410
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,040
so we'll need to ride two people per horse.

411
00:21:29,060 --> 00:21:29,640
It's alright.

412
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:30,480
Here's the plan.

413
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:31,440
Mo Xiao,

414
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:32,560
you ride with Wu Chen.

415
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,580
Zimu and Zifeng, you two ride together.

416
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,170
Jing,

417
00:21:36,360 --> 00:21:38,160
do you want to ride with Zisu

418
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:39,220
or with me?

419
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:40,430
Young Master Xie,

420
00:21:40,560 --> 00:21:42,360
you should ride with Young Master Jing.

421
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:44,080
You see,

422
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,400
no one wants to ride with you.

423
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:47,520
It looks like I'll have to make a sacrifice.

424
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:48,250
Let's mount up.

425
00:21:48,250 --> 00:21:48,420
(Fortune Inn)
Let's mount up.

426
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:49,650
(Fortune Inn)

427
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,870
Let's go.

428
00:22:43,900 --> 00:22:45,620
The Phoenix-shaped mark.

429
00:22:48,320 --> 00:22:49,640
Wearing black robes and dark clothing.

430
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,190
Are you from the Tianxing Sect?

431
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:53,330
Very good.

432
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,120
You still remember the Tianxing Sect.

433
00:22:55,600 --> 00:22:56,360
Where's the Phoenix-masked Woman?

434
00:22:56,840 --> 00:22:57,560
Tell her to come out.

435
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,290
It's her again, the Phoenix-masked Woman.

436
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:02,910
It seems the Tianxing Sect

437
00:23:02,930 --> 00:23:04,370
is back under her command.

438
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:06,000
We need to hurry to Peach Blossom Village.

439
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:06,920
That's right.

440
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:07,960
Let's depart immediately.

441
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:08,920
Head to Peach Blossom Village.

442
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:19,980
Great Guardian,

443
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:21,900
why did you suddenly stop?

444
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,480
Didn't you say you wanted to ambush Mo Xiao here

445
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,040
to present the Young Miss with a grand gift

446
00:23:26,060 --> 00:23:27,210
as a show of your loyalty?

447
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,000
Why does she have a Phoenix-shaped mark?

448
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,000
Then the Young Miss...

449
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:48,300
The Young Miss should naturally emit an extreme cold aura,

450
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:49,960
making it impossible for others to get close.

451
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,140
How come those two aren't giving off any freezing aura?

452
00:24:07,460 --> 00:24:12,420
(Peach Blossom Villa)

453
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,640
What a bad luck.

454
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,320
How long can you

455
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,560
hold them off?

456
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:53,680
I can hold them off for

457
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,120
as long as you need.

458
00:24:58,210 --> 00:24:59,320
At least an hour.

459
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:01,100
No problem.

460
00:25:01,360 --> 00:25:02,440
Leave it to me.

461
00:25:05,490 --> 00:25:06,910
But you'd better hurry.

462
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:11,570
The Phoenix Feather Token is with me.

463
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,120
Come and get it if you dare!

464
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:16,840
After him!

465
00:25:17,100 --> 00:25:18,030
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

466
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:20,600
Jing,

467
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:21,890
take care of Wu Chen.

468
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:23,140
You three, come with me.

469
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,120
Where are they going?

470
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,750
Why aren't they taking us?

471
00:25:29,280 --> 00:25:30,760
They can't take you.

472
00:25:30,990 --> 00:25:32,120
It's all your fault.

473
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:52,100
With just your pathetic skills,

474
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,120
you think you can snatch the Phoenix Feather Token?

475
00:25:57,270 --> 00:25:58,360
The Phoenix Feather Token has appeared.

476
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,680
It's at the entrance of the Myriad Isles Ice Lake.

477
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:03,880
It's not with you?

478
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,450
I was just joking,

479
00:26:06,490 --> 00:26:07,800
yet you actually believed me?

480
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,060
Go to the entrance of the Myriad Isles Ice Lake.

481
00:26:16,290 --> 00:26:17,910
It's been about an hour.

482
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:20,630
My barrier won't hold much longer.

483
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,040
Mo Xiao,

484
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:23,250
it's up to you now.

485
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:25,950
You guys,

486
00:26:25,980 --> 00:26:27,240
wait for me!

487
00:26:30,870 --> 00:26:31,550
Hurry!

488
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,020
Everyone's already headed to the entrance of Myriad Isles Ice Lake.

489
00:26:36,160 --> 00:26:37,100
It should be safe now.

490
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:38,090
Go back to the inn and wait for us.

491
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:42,440
Why are you still standing there? Go back.

492
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:47,560
I can help too.

493
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,820
They've all gone to the Myriad Isles Ice Lake.

494
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,120
Why didn't you go?

495
00:27:00,760 --> 00:27:01,800
I came to see you.

496
00:27:26,530 --> 00:27:27,350
Make sure this place is well-guarded.

497
00:27:29,680 --> 00:27:30,590
Young Sect Leader.

498
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:43,550
He did it.

499
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:45,400
He really did it.

500
00:29:03,860 --> 00:29:06,020
Today, I seal the Phoenix Feather Token here.

501
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,450
Those who wish to obtain it on Tongming Island

502
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:11,700
must first pass the trial of my Fengyue Sword.

503
00:29:13,970 --> 00:29:15,180
What does that mean?

504
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:17,580
So be it if he has obtained the Phoenix Feather Token,

505
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,590
but must he stand in the way of our fortune?

506
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:20,440
Exactly.

507
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:23,430
The Phoenix Feather Token is the key to entering the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

508
00:29:23,570 --> 00:29:24,850
It's fine if you won't hand it over,

509
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,690
but you can't stop us

510
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,160
from finding our own way there.

511
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:29,160
Exactly.

512
00:29:29,180 --> 00:29:29,900
I think

513
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:32,880
he plans to keep the Tianxing Secret Treasury all to himself.

514
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:35,930
Isn't he a sword immortal of the Shushan Sect?

515
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:37,700
How did the Shushan Sect

516
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:39,610
fall so low,

517
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:41,400
stooping to robbery and plunder in broad daylight?

518
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,120
I'm fine.

519
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,410
What's the point of calling themselves a righteous sect of immortals anymore?

520
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,610
This person,

521
00:29:47,260 --> 00:29:50,560
who claims to be a disciple of Sword Sovereign Fengyue,

522
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:54,050
recently stole the Phoenix Feather Token right out of our hands.

523
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:56,840
And now, he has the audacity to seal it

524
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,400
within this icy lake,

525
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,080
clearly intending to block

526
00:30:00,100 --> 00:30:01,340
our path to Tongming Island.

527
00:30:01,370 --> 00:30:02,020
Indeed.

528
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,920
There's only one Phoenix Feather Token.

529
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,640
Not all of us had the chance to obtain it.

530
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,120
But the one who took it

531
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:10,280
has blocked all our other routes

532
00:30:10,340 --> 00:30:11,480
to the island.

533
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:14,080
It's too domineering.

534
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:17,070
The Phoenix-masked Woman released the Phoenix Feather Token,

535
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
allowing only one person to enter the secret treasury and seek its treasures.

536
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:22,250
But seeing the true face of the Tianxing Secret Treasury

537
00:30:22,440 --> 00:30:25,450
is our shared desire.

538
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,720
If we all join forces,

539
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:29,090
there's no way

540
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:30,920
we can't break through a single barrier of his.

541
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:31,760
That's right.

542
00:30:31,780 --> 00:30:33,770
There's no way we can't break through a single barrier of his.

543
00:30:38,850 --> 00:30:41,630
While the Tianxing Secret Treasury is indeed filled with countless rare treasures,

544
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:44,080
it also houses many demonic and dark arts.

545
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,800
As disciples of the Shushan Sect,

546
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:47,400
we can't just stand by

547
00:30:47,420 --> 00:30:49,680
and allow these demonic arts to spread in the mortal world.

548
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:52,400
We, of the Shushan Sect, are not ones to kill indiscriminately.

549
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:54,920
But if you dare to trespass the barrier

550
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,680
and unleash evil magic to wreak havoc in the mortal world,

551
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,720
you're welcome to try.

552
00:31:23,670 --> 00:31:24,400
I'm fine.

553
00:31:25,160 --> 00:31:26,410
It's probably because sealing the barrier

554
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,240
just now drained too much inner energy.

555
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:29,840
A little rest should help.

556
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,430
Young Sect Leader,

557
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:32,360
have some water.

558
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,760
Hey, what we did

559
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,760
might have been a bit too high-profile.

560
00:31:38,360 --> 00:31:40,350
If the Sect Leader and the others find out,

561
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,040
they'll definitely issue an order right away

562
00:31:42,280 --> 00:31:43,430
to summon us back to the Shushan Sect

563
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:44,960
and punish us in the Tielyv Prison.

564
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,510
It's all because that Phoenix-masked Woman started the trouble.

565
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,140
The next time I see her,

566
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:51,280
I'll let her taste the power of my Pagoda Bell.

567
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:52,400
By the way,

568
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:54,160
where's Wu Chen?

569
00:31:55,050 --> 00:31:55,880
Wu Chen?

570
00:31:56,920 --> 00:31:58,790
I told her to wait for us at the inn.

571
00:31:59,040 --> 00:31:59,840
Where is she?

572
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,160
Weren't you supposed to keep an eye on her?

573
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:03,800
I saw everyone following you

574
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:05,120
to the entrance of the Myriad Isles Ice Lake.

575
00:32:05,140 --> 00:32:06,920
Since staying at the inn was no longer dangerous,

576
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:08,690
I left her there to wait for us.

577
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,640
Didn't I go to help you guys?

578
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:12,440
You're not helping;

579
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:13,560
you're causing trouble.

580
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:25,600
Fine,

581
00:32:26,640 --> 00:32:27,660
I'm causing trouble.

582
00:32:28,030 --> 00:32:29,450
Then I won't cause trouble anymore.

583
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:31,160
I'll leave, okay?

584
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,200
Jing!

585
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:34,960
Wu Chen.

586
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:36,080
I'll go find her.

587
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:37,760
Move aside.

588
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:39,960
Move aside!

589
00:32:42,910 --> 00:32:43,760
Young Sect Leader.

590
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,280
Young Sect Leader,

591
00:32:47,720 --> 00:32:49,570
my mission is to protect your safety.

592
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,040
You need to rest and recover immediately,

593
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:52,410
otherwise it will harm your body.

594
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:53,800
I can't let you go.

595
00:32:54,600 --> 00:32:55,160
Mo Xiao,

596
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:56,960
you stay here and rest well.

597
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,480
I'll go check on Jing first,

598
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:00,240
then I'll take the three of them to find Wu Chen.

599
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:01,640
Don't worry.

600
00:33:07,340 --> 00:33:07,800
Let's go.

601
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:15,320
Young Sect Leader,

602
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:16,740
you should rest well first.

603
00:33:16,920 --> 00:33:18,280
I will be guarding outside the room.

604
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:30,760
Wu Chen.

605
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,520
Wu Chen.

606
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,470
You know very well that's not what he meant.

607
00:34:08,120 --> 00:34:09,440
Why bother getting angry with him?

608
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,520
Then what did he mean?

609
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,550
I was clearly trying to help him.

610
00:34:15,580 --> 00:34:18,469
I rushed to help because I was worried about him.

611
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:21,679
Wu Chen isn't a three-year-old child.

612
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:24,429
Her cold energy outburst was so frightening.

613
00:34:24,800 --> 00:34:26,699
Why is she treated like a precious treasure,

614
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:28,560
while I'm the one who gets scolded?

615
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:30,480
He's just concerned

616
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,480
that Wu Chen can't control the cold energy inside her.

617
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,639
Plus, she's inexperienced and naive about the world.

618
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,280
That's why we take extra care of her.

619
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:39,620
Jing,

620
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,420
you're completely different from her.

621
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,480
Look at you,

622
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:43,719
your magical powers are strong.

623
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,150
You have both the Shushan Sect's immortal power

624
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:46,780
and the protection of the Pagoda Bell.

625
00:34:46,880 --> 00:34:49,080
You're the one who gives us the least worry and the most peace of mind.

626
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,380
Am I really that good?

627
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:53,400
Of course.

628
00:34:53,600 --> 00:34:54,880
Think about our journey together.

629
00:34:55,199 --> 00:34:56,250
At critical moments,

630
00:34:56,360 --> 00:34:58,120
you've always fought alongside us.

631
00:34:58,140 --> 00:34:58,880
Right?

632
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,670
When you're calm,

633
00:35:05,520 --> 00:35:06,600
you're gentle and lovely.

634
00:35:07,840 --> 00:35:08,840
When you're in action,

635
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:10,240
you're valiant and spirited.

636
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,720
How many girls

637
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:13,680
can be like you?

638
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,830
You're such a sweet talker.

639
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,280
I'm not lying to you.

640
00:35:18,520 --> 00:35:19,800
Everything I said is true.

641
00:35:24,680 --> 00:35:25,540
Where are you going?

642
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,160
I'm going to find Wu Chen.

643
00:35:29,600 --> 00:35:30,240
Then I'll go too.

644
00:35:41,960 --> 00:35:43,880
Where exactly are you taking me?

645
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:45,800
Didn't you say we were meeting someone?

646
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:47,880
There's no one here.

647
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:50,320
Wait,

648
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:53,000
you never intended to introduce me to anyone.

649
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,240
You want my Phoenix Feather Token.

650
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,680
It's not with me.

651
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:58,000
I returned it to Mo Xiao.

652
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,320
Who are you really?

653
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,080
Why is there

654
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:03,920
a Phoenix-shaped mark on the back of your neck?

655
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:08,280
So that's what you're curious about.

656
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,280
I was born with it.

657
00:36:10,440 --> 00:36:11,400
Born with it?

658
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:14,760
Impossible.

659
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,400
There can't be such a coincidence in this world.

660
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:18,840
Who are you really?

661
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:20,720
We're strangers.

662
00:36:20,880 --> 00:36:21,960
Don't make things difficult for me.

663
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:23,560
Otherwise, I might hurt you.

664
00:36:23,590 --> 00:36:24,800
You have a Phoenix-shaped mark on your body,

665
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:26,280
yet you're hanging around with Mo Xiao.

666
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:28,650
You're not leaving until you explain this clearly.

667
00:36:28,960 --> 00:36:31,340
What business is it of yours who I'm with?

668
00:36:31,370 --> 00:36:32,660
Let go of me now.

669
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,000
Or I'll hurt you.

670
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:35,270
Don't blame me then.

671
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:37,770
You're as helpless as a kitten when you're with Mo Xiao.

672
00:36:37,910 --> 00:36:39,030
You can't possibly hurt me.

673
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:39,720
Tell me.

674
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,760
Who are you really?

675
00:36:42,370 --> 00:36:43,440
Let... Let go of me!

676
00:36:44,570 --> 00:36:45,280
Stop right there!

677
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:41,520
How dare you stand in my way today to protect her!

678
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,440
Please calm down, Young Miss.

679
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:48,960
You still doubt me?

680
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,240
That's not it, Young Miss.

681
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
I just saw that

682
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:53,440
the woman called Wu Chen

683
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:56,080
has the same Phoenix-shaped mark as you.

684
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:57,560
And...

685
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,600
And she has the cold energy within her body.

686
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,040
Yes.

687
00:38:02,120 --> 00:38:04,160
So you suspect my identity is fake,

688
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:07,000
and that she is your real Young Miss, Feng Lixue?

689
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:08,120
Please calm down, Young Miss.

690
00:38:08,170 --> 00:38:09,400
I just thought that

691
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,600
such a strange coincidence shouldn't exist

692
00:38:11,950 --> 00:38:13,760
in this world.

693
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:15,240
That's why I feared

694
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:17,160
someone might be impersonating you,

695
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:19,370
so I resorted to this strategy

696
00:38:19,520 --> 00:38:20,880
to investigate the matter.

697
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,360
And the result?

698
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:24,200
The result...

699
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:25,500
Remember,

700
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:27,990
there is only one Feng Lixue in this world,

701
00:38:28,120 --> 00:38:29,120
and that is me.

702
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:31,480
As for Wu Chen, who's with Mo Xiao,

703
00:38:32,320 --> 00:38:34,240
her only purpose

704
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:36,440
is to help me kill Mo Xiao.

705
00:38:37,080 --> 00:38:37,640
Young Miss,

706
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:38,840
could it be that

707
00:38:39,360 --> 00:38:41,620
she's also part of your plan for revenge?

708
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:43,000
Just remember,

709
00:38:43,480 --> 00:38:44,660
our goal

710
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,600
is to avenge my father.

711
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:49,990
I understand.

712
00:38:51,800 --> 00:38:54,420
Mo Xiao has set up a barrier at the entrance of the Myriad Isles Ice Lake.

713
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,920
Is there really no way for us to enter the island?

714
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,000
That Phoenix-masked Woman

715
00:38:58,320 --> 00:38:59,560
is the daughter of Feng Xingtian.

716
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:02,240
She harbors a vendetta against the disciples of Sword Sovereign Fengyue

717
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,450
Even if we can't defeat Mo Xiao,

718
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,160
that Phoenix-masked Woman won't let him succeed so easily.

719
00:39:07,240 --> 00:39:07,800
That's right.

720
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,010
If necessary,

721
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:11,200
we might be able to lend a hand to the Phoenix-masked Woman.

722
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:14,100
Look!

723
00:39:25,240 --> 00:39:26,320
Haven't you found her?

724
00:39:28,680 --> 00:39:30,260
I think she must have gotten lost.

725
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:30,760
Let's go.

726
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,520
Keep looking.

727
00:39:38,560 --> 00:39:41,160
Isn't that the girl who's always with Mo Xiao?

728
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:43,050
The opportunity has come so quickly.

729
00:39:58,440 --> 00:39:59,040
Who's there?

730
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:08,080
To save Wu Chen, open the barrier.

731
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:19,900
She's awake.

732
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,360
A Phoenix-shaped mask.

733
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:26,440
You're the Phoenix-masked Woman.

734
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,240
You really don't remember me at all?

735
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:30,840
Of course I remember.

736
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:32,960
We met in Fengdu City.

737
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:35,240
Where is this?

738
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,600
What are you doing?

739
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,600
You're asking me what I'm doing?

740
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,200
I told him long ago that we shouldn't have let you live.

741
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,440
You don't even remember your own enemies.

742
00:40:45,560 --> 00:40:47,160
You don't deserve to live in this world.

743
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:55,760
What has he done to you?

744
00:40:58,460 --> 00:41:00,290
I have no idea what you're talking about.

745
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,770
It's precisely because you don't understand.

746
00:41:02,000 --> 00:41:03,820
That's why you're not worthy of being Feng Lixue.

747
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:06,200
You should die along with Mo Xiao.

748
00:41:06,700 --> 00:41:08,570
I'll deal with you first today,

749
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,050
then I'll go after Mo Xiao.

750
00:41:10,080 --> 00:41:11,250
You want to kill Mo Xiao?

751
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,050
I won't let you succeed.

752
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:27,760
I won't let you harm him.

753
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,200
I can't believe I can't hurt you.

754
00:41:34,660 --> 00:41:36,470
There's no way you're untouchable!

755
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:44,590
The Phoenix-shaped mark.

756
00:41:44,620 --> 00:41:45,730
You have it too?

757
00:41:56,120 --> 00:41:57,760
The Supreme Lord has already warned you.

758
00:41:58,360 --> 00:42:00,180
You're not allowed to interfere with his plans.

759
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,880
If you dare lay a hand on her again,

760
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,720
the Supreme Lord will make you disappear forever.

761
00:42:17,600 --> 00:42:19,480
Stick to your duties

762
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:20,760
and leave her alone.
