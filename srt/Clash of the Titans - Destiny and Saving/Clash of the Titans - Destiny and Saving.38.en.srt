00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,720
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,750
(Episode 38)

3
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,960
Young Master?

4
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:44,600
Young Master.

5
00:01:44,800 --> 00:01:46,160
Why are you here?

6
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:49,640
You've been working for my father all along.

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,080
What grand plan is about to succeed?

8
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,479
What is he planning to do?

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,000
Young Master, do you really

10
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,930
know nothing about Master's plan?

11
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,010
What do you mean?

12
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:01,940
It seems

13
00:02:02,120 --> 00:02:03,720
there's a lot you don't know.

14
00:02:16,240 --> 00:02:17,010
Master,

15
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:18,680
as soon as I received the message,

16
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:20,040
I rushed down the mountain.

17
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,570
I apologize for keeping you waiting, Master.

18
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:32,760
Master.

19
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:36,250
I have indeed been waiting for a long time.

20
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:39,000
But now, I've finally got what I've been waiting for.

21
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,480
Chongguang has finally found Yeyuan's son.

22
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,820
They're about to open the Millennium Token.

23
00:02:46,310 --> 00:02:47,720
Congratulations, Master.

24
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,600
Your great undertaking is about to succeed.

25
00:02:49,600 --> 00:02:51,120
Congratulations to you as well.

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,450
After hiding by his side for so many years,

27
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,370
you're finally about to achieve great success.

28
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:56,970
Master,

29
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,500
will I

30
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,410
be able to see my sister now?

31
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:01,840
Of course.

32
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,720
As long as we

33
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:07,120
obtain the Millennium Token,

34
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:08,180
you and your sister

35
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:09,880
will be able to reunite.

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:12,500
Thank you for your kindness, Master.

37
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:16,720
Back then,

38
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:19,480
Yeyuan

39
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,060
used the Blood Demon Pearl

40
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,360
to resurrect Chongguang,

41
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:28,520
giving him the blood of immortality.

42
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:30,970
Immortal and indestructible.

43
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,880
But in this world, how can there be

44
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:36,280
a truly immortal and indestructible body?

45
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:39,280
You've served by his side for many years,

46
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,640
so you must already know

47
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,760
where the Blood Demon Pearl's lifeline is.

48
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,520
As long as we break the Blood Demon Pearl,

49
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:48,880
no matter how powerful his demonic power is,

50
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,320
it will be of no use.

51
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:52,970
This battle at Mount Buzhou

52
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,970
will depend entirely on you.

53
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:05,410
What's wrong?

54
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:09,040
Are you reluctant to see him die,

55
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,010
or do you no longer want to see your sister?

56
00:04:13,850 --> 00:04:17,240
Master. I'm willing to help you severely injure Chongguang,

57
00:04:17,240 --> 00:04:18,120
but Master,

58
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:20,320
I have one last request.

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:22,800
I hope you will agree.

60
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,920
Let's hear it.

61
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:27,680
Can we spare his life?

62
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,130
Tomorrow,

63
00:05:40,159 --> 00:05:42,720
do you really intend to activate the Heavenly Demon Token

64
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,270
and go to Mount Buzhou?

65
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:46,240
Mother,

66
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,560
do you know why

67
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:51,659
Master Fengyue brought a demon's son

68
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,900
back to Shushan Sect for enlightenment?

69
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:55,690
And why he later took the risk

70
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:57,720
of entrusting the important task of guarding

71
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:59,320
the Millennium Token to him?

72
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:02,710
It's because Master Fengyue knew all along

73
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,240
that what needed protection was never the Millennium Token,

74
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:09,970
but the righteous hearts of people in this world.

75
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:12,150
If all hearts are righteous,

76
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:14,160
whether in the righteous path or the demonic way,

77
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,560
the Millennium Token needs no protection.

78
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:18,320
If hearts turn to evil,

79
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:21,640
even immortal sects can become dens of demons.

80
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:27,030
It's like how they named me Mo Xiao.

81
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,220
Mozi's lament over dyed silk.

82
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,460
With ambitions as high as the clouds.

83
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,880
Mo Xiao.

84
00:06:50,860 --> 00:06:52,040
I know you

85
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:54,340
care for all living beings

86
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:56,210
and carry a great mission.

87
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,280
But it's been 18 years,

88
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:03,640
I've just found you.

89
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,240
If anything

90
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:08,170
were to happen to you...

91
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:09,960
Mother,

92
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,610
please stand up.

93
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:16,680
In all my life,

94
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:19,680
what I'm most grateful for is that I have

95
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,140
such a righteous and understanding mother.

96
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,400
It's just that I have a heavy responsibility

97
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:27,320
and can't always be by your side.

98
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,270
Fortunately, there's Yunchao

99
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,930
to take care of you in my place.

100
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,520
If one day,

101
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,520
something unexpected were to happen to me...

102
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,159
It won't.

103
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:40,760
It won't happen. You'll be fine.

104
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:42,600
Everything will be alright.

105
00:07:54,159 --> 00:07:54,800
Mother,

106
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,380
I have a favor to ask of you, Mother.

107
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,160
Go ahead.

108
00:08:05,040 --> 00:08:06,240
In this world,

109
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:08,800
besides you, Mother,

110
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,680
there is one other person
I feel guilty towards.

111
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:16,570
If something were to happen to me tomorrow,

112
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,400
and I couldn't tell her in person,

113
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:23,760
please convey this message to her.

114
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,810
By the Peach Blossom Village's riverback,

115
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:29,940
I have prepared a place for her to live,

116
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:33,299
where she can spend
the rest of her days in peace.

117
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:30,610
What are you doing here?

118
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:33,760
I'm here to take you away.

119
00:09:36,990 --> 00:09:38,440
Are you joking?

120
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:43,770
What?

121
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,720
Seeing that Chongguang's position
as Demon Lord is in jeopardy,

122
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,200
you turn around and throw yourself at

123
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,460
me, the new Demon Lord?

124
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:51,080
Mo Xiao,

125
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,640
you shouldn't have come back.

126
00:09:53,640 --> 00:09:56,240
You especially shouldn't
become the Demon Lord.

127
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,880
Once you choose this path,

128
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,440
there's no turning back.

129
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:03,100
Why should I turn back?

130
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:07,380
Do you really plan

131
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,130
to join the demon side?

132
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:15,360
You once advised me to leave Chongguang

133
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:17,520
and return to the light.

134
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:20,600
Why are you now...

135
00:10:24,080 --> 00:10:25,880
You were originally righteous,

136
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:29,460
so returning to the righteous path is your destiny.

137
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:33,620
But I'm different.

138
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:39,260
From the moment I was born, I was a demon's son.

139
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:43,760
Becoming the Demon Lord is the path
I'm meant to take in this life.

140
00:10:49,820 --> 00:10:50,830
Silly girl,

141
00:10:51,820 --> 00:10:53,820
of course I won't forget this place.

142
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:55,380
But one day,

143
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:57,050
we will build a true

144
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,360
home of our own.

145
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,140
Mo Xiao,

146
00:11:05,910 --> 00:11:07,010
do you remember?

147
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,080
During the three days of the Spiritual Pearl,

148
00:11:09,080 --> 00:11:10,040
you said to me,

149
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:14,010
"Do you want to be
an ordinary married couple with me?"

150
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:16,920
Let's go.

151
00:11:21,840 --> 00:11:23,770
The Mo Xiao of the past is long dead.

152
00:11:24,280 --> 00:11:26,680
Now you're Chongguang's Supreme Consort.

153
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,800
It's probably inappropriate
to say these things now.

154
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,500
You can hate me,

155
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:34,600
resent me,

156
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:37,320
punish me however you want.

157
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,400
But you can't give up on yourself.

158
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,080
You are Shushan Sect's

159
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:47,880
youngest sword immortal.

160
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:50,760
When I first saw you,

161
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,330
you were handsome and elegant,

162
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:55,890
with iron Will and gentle soul,

163
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:58,230
caring for all living beings.

164
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,120
You were like a dazzling light

165
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:06,420
illuminating the entire snow plain.

166
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:10,690
That Mo Xiao.

167
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:14,850
What's wrong with you?

168
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:16,320
I don't need you to remind me

169
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:17,580
what I was like before.

170
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,110
With this Heart Guarding Sand from Shushan Sect here,

171
00:12:20,110 --> 00:12:21,720
the immortal sects' techniques

172
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:23,950
are constantly questioning my heart.

173
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,480
Heart Guarding Sand.

174
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:28,860
You planted the Heart Guarding Sand.

175
00:12:28,960 --> 00:12:29,910
Let me see.

176
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:30,880
Go away.

177
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:33,190
The night is fading.

178
00:12:33,240 --> 00:12:34,800
The two of us alone like this,

179
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,060
it might cause gossip.

180
00:12:36,240 --> 00:12:37,520
Please, have some self-respect.

181
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:38,320
Please leave.

182
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,800
Mo Xiao.

183
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:41,600
Go!

184
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:51,120
Alright.

185
00:13:23,770 --> 00:13:24,500
You're back.

186
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,120
You went to Yaoling Palace again?

187
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,900
I told you long ago

188
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:35,620
that he would eventually take this path.

189
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,660
No one can change it.

190
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:39,740
He has accepted it.

191
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,960
What about you?

192
00:13:41,690 --> 00:13:42,810
You should accept

193
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,880
the path that belongs to you, shouldn't you?

194
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,240
We have no other choice.

195
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:48,000
And all of this

196
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:50,860
is in accordance with your wishes, isn't it?

197
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:51,760
No.

198
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:53,160
The Millennium Token

199
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:55,580
is an ancient divine artifact.

200
00:13:55,970 --> 00:13:57,500
The one who can open it

201
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,250
is also destined.

202
00:13:59,830 --> 00:14:00,630
All of this

203
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,160
is merely the call of the Millennium Token.

204
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:04,600
Years ago,

205
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,980
his father and I

206
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:07,360
almost succeeded.

207
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,250
In the end,

208
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,360
we were stopped by Fengyue.

209
00:14:12,700 --> 00:14:13,810
Now, he

210
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,520
is not only the heir of the Sword Sovereign,

211
00:14:15,520 --> 00:14:17,920
but also possesses the bloodline of Yeyuan.

212
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:20,470
Who else could stop him?

213
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,970
As long as tomorrow

214
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,810
he can summon a hundred thousand demon soldiers

215
00:14:25,810 --> 00:14:27,130
to go to Mount Buzhou,

216
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:29,440
the Millennium Token

217
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:31,320
will be mine.

218
00:14:34,850 --> 00:14:36,380
How can you be sure

219
00:14:36,680 --> 00:14:38,460
that he will definitely help you?

220
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:39,340
Because

221
00:14:41,280 --> 00:14:42,460
this is his destiny.

222
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:45,680
He has no other choice.

223
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,850
Today, Young Supreme Lord,

224
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,160
if you can, in front of the followers of the Heavenly Demon Clan,

225
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,600
activate the Heavenly Demon Token

226
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:22,000
and summon a hundred thousand demon soldiers,

227
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:24,480
the position of Demon Lord of the Heavenly Demon Clan

228
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:25,520
will be yours.

229
00:15:29,710 --> 00:15:30,770
As for me,

230
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:34,680
I will return to being the Great Guardian of the Heavenly Demon Clan.

231
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:36,650
Thank you for your support.

232
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:40,800
She actually opened the Heavenly Demon Abyss.

233
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,880
The Heavenly Demon Power is indeed with her.

234
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:43,900
Feng Lixue.

235
00:16:44,330 --> 00:16:45,520
What are you going to do?

236
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:47,360
Listen up, all of you!

237
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:48,680
The Heavenly Demon Token and the Heavenly Demon Power

238
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,400
are now both in my possession.

239
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:52,560
If I jump into the Heavenly Demon Abyss,

240
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:53,760
the myriad demons will be dispersed,

241
00:16:53,760 --> 00:16:56,480
the Heavenly Demon Token and the Heavenly Demon Power will disappear forever,

242
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,740
and the hundred thousand demon army will sleep eternally.

243
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,040
Lixue.

244
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:03,720
No!

245
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,300
If the myriad demons are dispersed,

246
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,690
you will also face eternal damnation.

247
00:17:09,960 --> 00:17:10,890
Come back here!

248
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:19,190
Mo Xiao.

249
00:17:20,089 --> 00:17:21,220
This time,

250
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,130
I'll make the choice for you.

251
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,480
You won't have to suffer from the Heart Guarding Sand's interrogation anymore.

00:19:56,650 --> 00:19:57,980
Let's wait a bit longer.

317
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:01,050
No.

318
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:04,010
No!

319
00:20:04,570 --> 00:20:07,010

-Star Lord.
-Mother.

321
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:09,330
I swear I'm not lying to you, Mother.

322
00:20:09,330 --> 00:20:10,170
Star Lord!

Lixue.

325
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,120
Hurry and save Lixue.

326
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:42,430
Supreme Lord,

327
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:43,820
the backlash you suffered is severe.

328
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:45,040
It has already damaged your primordial spirit.

329
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,880
Protecting your primordial spirit is the priority now.

330
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:49,770
Lixue cannot die.

331
00:20:50,630 --> 00:20:52,570
Go save her quickly!

332
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:53,280
Alright.

333
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,200
I will go find a way immediately.

334
00:21:02,650 --> 00:21:04,730
Lixue!

335
00:21:08,950 --> 00:21:10,970
Lixue, Lixue.

336
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:24,520
Lixue.

337
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:26,880
Lixue.

338
00:21:27,560 --> 00:21:29,270
I'm Tuoshuo, the Right Guardian of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

339
00:21:29,270 --> 00:21:31,070
Greetings, Young Supreme Lord.

340
00:21:32,430 --> 00:21:33,420
Right Guardian.

341
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:34,800
Senior.

342
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,240
I

343
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,570
was originally the Right Guardian following

344
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,790
Supreme Lord Yeyuan's Right Guardian.

345
00:21:42,330 --> 00:21:44,040
During the great battle at Mount Buzhou years ago,

346
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:45,400
the Supreme Lord perished.

347
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:47,660
Chongguang succeeded as the Supreme Lord.

348
00:21:47,660 --> 00:21:49,520
I refused to submit to Chongguang,

349
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,910
and was cast down into
the Heavenly Demon Abyss by him.

350
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,680
Fortunately, my life was tenacious.

351
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,480
After exhausting all my spiritual power,

352
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:56,940
I miraculously survived.

353
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,710
Finally,

354
00:21:58,840 --> 00:22:00,950
you have returned, Young Supreme Lord.

355
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,770
The Heavenly Demon Sect can be saved now...

356
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:03,420
Senior,

357
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,500
we'll discuss this matter another day.

358
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:05,830
Let's save Lixue first.

359
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,450
I have just checked her pulse.

360
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:12,130
Inside her body,

361
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:14,190
there is actually the Heavenly Demon Power of the three Sacred Stones.

362
00:22:14,190 --> 00:22:16,250
But she is not of Yeyuan's bloodline.

363
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:19,880
With such divine power falling into the Heavenly Demon Abyss,

364
00:22:19,880 --> 00:22:21,760
the myriad demons will be dispersed.

365
00:22:21,760 --> 00:22:23,090
She will certainly die.

366
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:25,360
Then what can be done to save her?

367
00:22:26,730 --> 00:22:27,780
To save her,

368
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,520
there's only one way.

369
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,040
Transfer the Heavenly Demon Power of the three Sacred Stones

370
00:22:32,040 --> 00:22:33,230
into your body.

371
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,620
Then transfer it to me.

372
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:36,360
But the supreme Heavenly Demon Power,

373
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:37,760
once it enters your body,

374
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,810
will clash with

375
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,880
the spiritual power of the immortal sects within you.

376
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,520
The immortal and demonic powers will wax and wane.

377
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:44,740
Such pain

378
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:47,500
is not something an ordinary person can endure.

379
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,540
Young Supreme Lord...

380
00:22:48,540 --> 00:22:49,190
Senior.

381
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,240
I'm willing.

382
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,360
Let's begin.

383
00:24:46,120 --> 00:24:47,340
What do you want to do?

384
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,020
The things you want to do

385
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,040
can only be accomplished with my help.

386
00:24:51,040 --> 00:24:53,040
Yet you hesitate to let me out.

387
00:24:53,360 --> 00:24:54,610
Why is that?

388
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:55,940
I am a disciple of the immortal sects.

389
00:24:55,940 --> 00:24:56,920
The heir of the Sword Sovereign.

390
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,380
My life's purpose is to eliminate evil and protect the righteous path.

391
00:24:58,380 --> 00:25:00,240
I will never turn to the dark side.

392
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,490
You are the son of Yeyuan.

393
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:05,420
The blood of the demon race flows through your veins.

394
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:07,400
In this life, you are destined to be a demon.

395
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,640
Though I have a demon's body,

396
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,500
my heart aspires to the great way.

397
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:11,860
The things I do

398
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,720
are without shame before the Immortal Lord,

399
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:15,100
and I will never be ashamed of myself.

400
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:18,090
Everyone in the world believes you are a demon.

401
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:19,450
You are the demon's son.

402
00:25:19,640 --> 00:25:22,340
Shushan and other immortal sects have abandoned you.

403
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:24,420
Mo Xiao, in this life, it's destined

404
00:25:24,730 --> 00:25:26,960
that you can only be a demon.

405
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:31,960
No.

406
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,740
It wasn't me.

407
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,120
It wasn't me.

408
00:25:42,320 --> 00:25:44,720
You can only be a demon.

409
00:25:44,740 --> 00:25:45,360
You!

410
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,150
Your life is mine!

411
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:50,410
Master Fengyue.

412
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:53,080
Mo Xiao.

413
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:55,360
Are you ready to give up?

414
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,330
Master Fengyue.

415
00:26:58,560 --> 00:27:00,360
Why didn't you kill me back then?

416
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,140
You didn't kill me.

417
00:27:02,520 --> 00:27:04,840
Now I have to bear all this.

418
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:09,000
I'm so tired.

419
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:12,630
I'm so tired.

420
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:15,720
Mo Xiao.

421
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,450
The rise and fall of demons,

422
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,320
it's all in your heart.

423
00:27:24,290 --> 00:27:26,140
Even the strongest demonic power,

424
00:27:26,140 --> 00:27:27,620
if used for good,

425
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,600
can also save the world.

426
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:33,610
I have poured my life's work into you,

427
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:36,840
which is the result of my efforts to subdue demons.

428
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,530
Although you are the son of the Demon Lord,

429
00:27:41,560 --> 00:27:44,690
you have been educated by our righteous immortal sects.

430
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,200
Remember my teachings:

431
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:48,880
Guard your heart,

432
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:50,220
stay righteous.

433
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,140
No matter where you are,

434
00:27:52,360 --> 00:27:53,560
you will

435
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:55,920
never be a demon.

436
00:27:58,640 --> 00:27:59,520
Mo Xiao,

437
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:02,490
don't feel wronged,

438
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:04,020
don't back down,

439
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:06,820
and most importantly, don't give up.

440
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:11,470
I planted the Heart Guarding Sand in you years ago,

441
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:15,320
borrowing the spirits of generations of Shushan Sect sword immortals

442
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,180
to protect your righteous heart.

443
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,360
If your righteous heart remains strong,

444
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:21,760
unmoved,

445
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:23,720
and free from distracting thoughts.

446
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:26,990
the Heart Guarding Sand will only become your blessing,

447
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:28,850
dissolving into nothingness,

448
00:28:28,920 --> 00:28:30,920
no longer questioning your heart.

449
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:34,710
You don't need to be tormented by guilt anymore.

450
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:37,560
Trust your heart,

451
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,290
and do what you must do.

452
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:47,560
Don't forget why Master Fengyue and I, across two generations,

453
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:50,930
have poured so much effort into you.

454
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:55,180
We have taken on this heavy responsibility,

455
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,140
and we are prepared

456
00:28:57,400 --> 00:28:59,840
to subdue demons with our own lives.

457
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:01,920
But Master,

458
00:29:03,280 --> 00:29:05,080
to subdue demons and protect the Way,

459
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:06,480
what exactly should I do?

460
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:08,480
Tell me,

461
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:10,200
what exactly should I do?

462
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,120
You actually have the Heart Guarding Sand of the immortal sects within you.

463
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,560
The demonic power within you is surging.

464
00:29:42,560 --> 00:29:45,160
The Heart Guarding Sand will strike at your heart.

465
00:29:45,160 --> 00:29:46,080
Young Supreme Lord,

466
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:46,940
in this world,

467
00:29:47,120 --> 00:29:49,200
someone who can unite the immortal and demonic powers,

468
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,600
I have never seen before.

469
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:52,490
Young Supreme Lord,

470
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,390
I

471
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:04,360
will use the last of my remaining spiritual power

472
00:30:04,360 --> 00:30:05,400
to assist you,

473
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:06,840
and protect your mind.

474
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:08,320
The outcome

475
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,690
depends on you,

476
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:12,120
and the fate of our Heavenly Demon Sect.

477
00:30:22,480 --> 00:30:23,200
Master!

478
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:29,440
Right Guardian.

479
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:33,260
I have been waiting here for you for many years.

480
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:34,940
It's all for telling you

481
00:30:35,080 --> 00:30:36,730
a truth today.

482
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,120
In these three realms,

483
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:42,110
immortals, humans and demons, each have their own place.

484
00:30:42,110 --> 00:30:45,640
Originally, our celestial demon clan retreated to Mount Suyu in the demon realm.

485
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,370
Even demons have their own way.

486
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,400
We only sought to coexist peacefully with the immortal sects in the two realms.

487
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:52,130
Each following their own path.

488
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:54,480
But ever since the fallen god Chongguang

489
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,020
was reborn on Mount Suyu,

490
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,720
everything has changed.

491
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,360
The disasters in the world

492
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:01,690
all arise from selfish desires and greed.

493
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,520
What does it matter if one is an immortal

494
00:31:03,520 --> 00:31:04,880
or a demon?

495
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,880
As long as one follows their own path,

496
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:09,680
different paths can lead to the same destination.

497
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:15,810
Each following their own path.

498
00:31:16,560 --> 00:31:18,620
Different paths, same destination.

499
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:29,610
Each following their own path.

500
00:31:29,950 --> 00:31:32,010
Different paths, same destination.

501
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,280
Listen to me.

502
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,920
The world will not believe you.

503
00:32:06,940 --> 00:32:08,200
Unmoved and unshaken.

504
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:10,500
Free from distracting thoughts.

505
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:11,760
The eyes of the world

506
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,170
have never been important.

507
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:39,240
You're right.

508
00:32:40,170 --> 00:32:41,580
Unmoved and unshaken.

509
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:44,420
Free from distracting thoughts.

510
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:46,940
Immortals and demons stand opposed.

511
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,520
Almost there.

512
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,200
It's close.

513
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,150
It's almost time.

514
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:40,040
It's done.

515
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,560
Young Supreme Lord,

516
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,280
it's done.

517
00:33:44,690 --> 00:33:45,460
Senior.

518
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:50,600
Supreme Lord.

519
00:33:51,770 --> 00:33:53,520
I have done my best.

520
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,320
I can go see you now.

521
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:02,740
Senior.

522
00:34:39,639 --> 00:34:40,440
Supreme Lord.

523
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:42,969
Where is Lixue?

524
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:43,960
Rest assured, Supreme Lord.

525
00:34:43,960 --> 00:34:46,690
Lixue has already left the Heavenly Demon Abyss.

526
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,530
How did she leave?

527
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,040
Mo Xiao jumped into the Heavenly Demon Abyss

528
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:51,969
and rescued her.

529
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:53,250
However,

530
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,360
they are no longer on Mount Suyu.

531
00:35:22,470 --> 00:35:26,940
(The Heavenly Demon Token has been destroyed)

532
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,970
The Heavenly Demon Token has been destroyed.

533
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:42,780
So you really are Father's shadow assassin.

534
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,480
What grand plan is about to be accomplished?

535
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:45,880
What does he intend to do?

536
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:31,500
♫Tears stain the paper with each stroke, as the words betray my true feelings♫

537
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:38,470
♫Our souls intertwined like flames throughout this lifetime, roaming freely with the wind♫

538
00:36:39,040 --> 00:36:45,020
♫The pale moonlight hides from view, and love's longing fades to gray♫

539
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:51,890
♫A gentle breeze drifts through my heart, crafting a melancholic melody♫

540
00:36:52,230 --> 00:36:58,370
♫Silken robes are soaked beneath the umbrella, as heavy rain pours down♫

541
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:05,040
♫Through life and death, we wander, as time and fate run dry♫

542
00:37:05,310 --> 00:37:11,980
♫The sky quietly foretells the thorns that lie ahead♫

543
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:12,680
♫Entwined pride and affection stir the world around us♫

544
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,610
Dead in body, wandering in spirit.
♫Entwined pride and affection stir the world around us♫

♫Entwined pride and affection stir the world around us♫

546
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:17,320
I can't believe I'm back here.
♫Entwined pride and affection stir the world around us♫

♫Entwined pride and affection stir the world around us♫

548
00:37:19,010 --> 00:37:21,990
♫Pity the love that can't be spoken aloud♫

♫Cross the bitter sea of hardship♫

550
00:37:25,350 --> 00:37:31,830
♫Persisting through life after life, unwilling to awaken♫

551
00:37:32,020 --> 00:37:35,190
♫When the mist has cleared and the clouds have drifted away♫

552
00:37:35,220 --> 00:37:38,560
♫Our eternal bond shall find its way♫

♫For all eternity♫

555
00:38:02,310 --> 00:38:08,030
♫A vivid dream within a dream, a fleeting moment of fate♫

556
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:15,300
♫Endless longing through three lifetimes, left to the wind♫

557
00:38:15,320 --> 00:38:21,960
♫Emotions tangled and lingering, worldly ties seen through♫

558
00:38:21,990 --> 00:38:28,970
♫Love and hate fall into a whirlpool, evenly matched♫

00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,070
♫To cherish love is hard♫

Even you are here.

574
00:39:05,200 --> 00:39:05,350
But unexpectedly,

575
00:39:05,350 --> 00:39:06,420
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫
But unexpectedly,

576
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:06,620
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

577
00:39:06,620 --> 00:39:08,310
all of this is real.
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

578
00:39:08,310 --> 00:39:09,330
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

579
00:39:09,330 --> 00:39:11,560
After we left the Spiritual Pearl Illusion Realm,
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

580
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:14,160
you actually turned everything into reality.
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

581
00:39:14,160 --> 00:39:14,920
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

582
00:39:14,920 --> 00:39:15,840
Silly.
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

583
00:39:15,840 --> 00:39:16,440
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

584
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:17,240
I'm here.
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

585
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,770
How could I let anything happen to you?

586
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,660
Your Heart Guarding Sand is gone.

587
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:32,240
In the Heavenly Demon Abyss,

588
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:34,960
the Heavenly Demon Spirit almost awakened the demonic nature within me.

589
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,820
Fortunately, with the spiritual power assistance from my master and Master Fengyue,

590
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,820
I'm fine now.

591
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:39,600
That's great.

592
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,660
I should be the one lecturing you.

593
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:49,160
In the Heavenly Demon Abyss,
the myriad demons would be dispersed, so dangerous,

594
00:39:49,160 --> 00:39:51,160
how could you just jump in like that?

595
00:39:52,040 --> 00:39:54,130
I just didn't want Chongguang

596
00:39:54,280 --> 00:39:55,680
to pressure you anymore.

597
00:40:04,940 --> 00:40:06,240
Why are you so foolish?

598
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:09,650
If I hadn't been able to rescue you in time,

599
00:40:09,680 --> 00:40:11,040
in this Heavenly Demon Abyss,

600
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:13,360
both the Heavenly Demon Token and Heavenly Demon Power would have dissipated.

601
00:40:13,360 --> 00:40:15,110
-Even you…
-I’m not afraid.

602
00:40:15,520 --> 00:40:17,250
As long as it's for you,

603
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:18,640
I fear nothing.

604
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:26,520
Silly.

605
00:40:28,250 --> 00:40:29,150
Mo Xiao.

606
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:30,360
Tell me,

607
00:40:30,380 --> 00:40:32,410
we have already left Mount Suyu.

608
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:33,920
Does that mean we no longer need to

609
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,780
be burdened by the affairs of immortals and demons?

610
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,720
I originally thought

611
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:43,140
the Spiritual Pearl Illusion Realm would only last for three days.

612
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:44,320
Unexpectedly...

613
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:48,610
It's so good to be alive.

614
00:40:49,080 --> 00:40:51,210
Good things happen when you're alive,

615
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:51,800
right?

616
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,760
The universe is eternal,

617
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:01,560
life is but a hundred years.

618
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:03,920
This body cannot be obtained again,

619
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,520
this day passes most easily.

620
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:07,240
Lixue,

621
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:09,920
promise me

622
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,650
you won't do anything foolish from now on.

623
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:16,200
Alright.
