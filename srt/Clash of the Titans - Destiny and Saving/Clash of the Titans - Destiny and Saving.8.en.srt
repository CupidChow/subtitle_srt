(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,670
(Episode 8)

3
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:46,880
If I don't release her,

4
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,840
what do you want to do?

5
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:50,900
If you don't release her,

6
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:52,850
even if

7
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,680
I endure all punishments in the Tielyv Branch's prisons,

8
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,160
I will still rescue Wu Chen.

9
00:01:59,080 --> 00:01:59,720
Fine.

10
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:01,520
Very well.

11
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,440
Shushan Sect disciples, listen to my orders.

12
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:07,720
Strengthen the Demon Subduing Spell.

13
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:14,390
(Demon Subduing Palace)

14
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:36,930
Supreme Lord.

15
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,100
Remember this,

16
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:47,770
even if I'm reborn as a ghost,

17
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,400
I will come back for revenge!

18
00:02:57,380 --> 00:02:58,040
Master!

19
00:03:10,220 --> 00:03:10,780
Master!

20
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:13,480
I beg you, Master.

21
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:16,420
If you persist in pleading for her,

22
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,200
I will strengthen the Demon Subduing Spell again.

23
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,640
If you dare to trespass into the Demon Subduing Palace,

24
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,880
I will summon the four Branch Leaders of Shushan Sect

25
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:24,140
to activate the Demon Subduing Formation.

26
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:25,120
At that time,

27
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:26,960
even if you exhaust all your cultivation,

28
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,110
you might barely survive,

29
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:29,280
but Wu Chen

30
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:31,470
will surely perish in the Demon Subduing Palace,

31
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,240
completely destroyed in body and spirit.

32
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,590
I like this feeling.

33
00:03:51,079 --> 00:03:52,260
This pain

34
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:55,840
makes me feel

35
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,890
that I'm alive.

36
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:05,600
Is there something?

37
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:06,280
Supreme Lord,

38
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:09,150
she has been imprisoned in the Demon Subduing Palace by the leader of the Shushan Sect.

39
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,079
No wonder.

40
00:04:17,930 --> 00:04:18,579
Supreme Lord,

41
00:04:18,730 --> 00:04:20,230
what should we do now?

42
00:04:28,850 --> 00:04:30,440
She must not come to any harm.

43
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:32,210
Go inform that person.

44
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,050
Tell him to take good care of her.

45
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:35,960
Yes.

46
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:43,030
No.

47
00:04:43,409 --> 00:04:44,130
Please don't.

48
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:00,370
What you should do,

49
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:01,910
the choice is yours.

50
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:02,870
Master,

51
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,550
why must you do this?

52
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:07,160
Go to the Sword Pavilion and reflect on your actions right now.

53
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:10,300
If you dare to disobey again,

54
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,760
no one will leave

55
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:14,620
Demon Subduing Palace alive today.

56
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,800
Lock him up in the Sword Pavilion.

57
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:17,200
Yes.

58
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:17,800
Master.

59
00:05:18,690 --> 00:05:19,240
Let me go!

60
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:19,920
Master.

61
00:05:20,640 --> 00:05:21,400
Master.

62
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,550
Wu Chen!

63
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:18,740
You've grown quite capable, haven't you?

64
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:22,120
For that Wu Chen,

65
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,330
you dare to break into Demon Subduing Palace

66
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:27,000
and defy your master!

67
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:28,960
Have you forgotten who you are?

68
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,010
Have you forgotten the mission you bear?

69
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,010
I dare not forget, Master.

70
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:34,840
Then why do you keep concealing the truth?

71
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:36,280
And why did you bring her back to Shushan Sect?

72
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:37,560
I have reported to you, Master.

73
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:40,040
I brought Wu Chen back to Shushan Sect

74
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:42,360
because I feared the snow demon would harm her life.

75
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,120
So I brought her back to heal her wounds.

76
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,040
You're still lying.

77
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:47,880
Speak.

78
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,480
Why did you save her?

79
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:52,360
This woman

80
00:06:53,320 --> 00:06:54,360
is alone and helpless.

81
00:06:55,320 --> 00:06:56,240
I saved her

82
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:57,560
because...

83
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,320
Speak!

84
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:01,640
Why did you save her?

85
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,480
From childhood to adulthood,

86
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,120
you have never told a lie,

87
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:11,520
never violated a single rule of the Shushan Sect.

88
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,960
You are the only successor of the Sword Sovereign,

89
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:15,770
the future hope of our Shushan Sect.

90
00:07:15,920 --> 00:07:16,800
But now,

91
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,120
for that Wu Chen,

92
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:23,480
you have forgotten the Sword Sovereign's last wish.

93
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:24,600
I dare not forget, Master.

94
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:27,760
I was born to inherit the Sword Sovereign's will.

95
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:29,860
I'm supposed to fight for the Shushan Sect,

96
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:32,159
and all living beings under heaven.

97
00:07:32,600 --> 00:07:35,200
Then why did you risk your life to save her,

98
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:36,920
throwing everything else aside?

99
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:38,680
What was it all for?

100
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:40,120
Because she...

101
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,260
Because Wu Chen

102
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,760
is one of the people in the world.

103
00:08:02,600 --> 00:08:04,270
Isn't it because

104
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,990
she is Feng Lixue?

105
00:08:10,470 --> 00:08:13,090
She was born with an unusual cold condition,

106
00:08:13,640 --> 00:08:15,320
extraordinary.

107
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:17,600
You've long suspected that she is

108
00:08:17,630 --> 00:08:19,270
the Feng Lixue who fell off the cliff years ago.

109
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,160
So that's why you disregarded the rules of Shushan Sect

110
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:22,480
and brought her back to Shushan,

111
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:23,440
didn't you?

112
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:24,600
Master,

113
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:26,600
you've known all along.

114
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,320
Born with an extraordinary cold nature,

115
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,080
rarely seen in this world.

116
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,320
You knew this would be hard to conceal,

117
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,480
so you hid her here.

118
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,309
Have you forgotten

119
00:08:41,240 --> 00:08:44,840
that years ago, the Sword Sovereign predicted this girl would be your destined calamity?

120
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,400
How could I stand by and do nothing?

121
00:08:51,650 --> 00:08:53,250
It was precisely because Lixue

122
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,300
was my destined calamity

123
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,850
that we witnessed her fall off the cliff

124
00:08:58,200 --> 00:08:59,630
and were unable to rescue her in time.

125
00:09:01,280 --> 00:09:02,550
If now

126
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,510
Wu Chen still dies due to her destined fate

127
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,390
in vain at Demon Subduing Palace,

128
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:10,000
how can you expect me

129
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:12,780
to face the righteous principles of the Shushan Sect with a clear conscience in the future?

130
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:15,850
For you, for the Shushan Sect,

131
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,570
for all living beings under heaven,

132
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,120
I cannot take this risk.

133
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,160
Master.

134
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,080
Even if I violate the principles of the Shushan Sect

135
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,430
and commit the sin of killing,

136
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,040
I, Yuan Beichen, will bear it alone.

137
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:27,960
As for you,

138
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,520
never forget

139
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,210
why the Sword Sovereign sacrificed his life

140
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:35,800
to save you back then.

141
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:37,240
Master.

142
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:43,990
What's the news?

143
00:09:44,020 --> 00:09:45,240
The Shushan Sect sent word back saying

144
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:46,440
there's no immediate threat to her life.

145
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:47,740
However,

146
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,480
will the Shushan Sect's suspicions about her identity

147
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:50,680
cause trouble?

148
00:09:58,440 --> 00:10:00,550
Did you bring back that fox?

149
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:01,320
Yes, I did.

150
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,000
Let her in.

151
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,040
Come in.

152
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:10,780
I'm Snowy, greetings, Master.

153
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,380
You accompanied Wu Chen

154
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:25,760
to have lived in the Snow Cave of Mang Mountain for ten years,

155
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:27,720
fully transformed into human form,

156
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,660
and has become quite attractive.

157
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:38,570
However, it's a pity.

158
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,000
You won't need your look anymore.

159
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:42,190
Master, you saved my life.

160
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:43,970
The spiritual power was also given by you.

161
00:10:44,240 --> 00:10:45,720
My ability to cultivate into human form

162
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,240
is all thanks to your kindness.

163
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:49,480
As long as you need,

164
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,160
I can transform into any form.

165
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:53,720
I like your

166
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:54,800
obedient demeanor.

167
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:55,800
Come.

168
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,300
Let me out!

169
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,100
Let me out!

170
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,720
Let me out!

171
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,240
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

172
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,980
She's just a wisp of consciousness.

173
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,080
She can't hurt you.

174
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:20,560
From this day forward,

175
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,800
I want you to be her physical vessel.

176
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,590
From now on, you will be her.

177
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:30,420
Master,

178
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,010
I'm just a

179
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:34,940
snow fox with little cultivation.

180
00:11:35,320 --> 00:11:36,240
I'm afraid...

181
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,000
Your lives

182
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,520
all belong to me.

183
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:46,790
(The Heavenly Secret Manual on Tongming Island)

184
00:13:02,650 --> 00:13:06,120
(Spirit Soaring to the Heavens)

185
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,400
Get up.

186
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:29,440
Does it hurt?

187
00:13:31,840 --> 00:13:32,360
No, it doesn't.

188
00:13:33,590 --> 00:13:35,680
It seems I wrongly accused you, my disciple.

189
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,290
Since Feng Xingtian's daughter

190
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,440
has appeared at the Thousand Island Ice Lake,

191
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:45,540
Wu Chen's strange cold syndrome

192
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:48,360
might indeed be a coincidence.

193
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,250
However, that woman with the phoenix mask

194
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:52,480
suddenly appearing at the Thousand Island Ice Lake,

195
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:53,940
and

196
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,440
announce the opening of the Heavenly Secret Manual

197
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,680
to the world.

198
00:13:59,240 --> 00:14:01,240
I find it very strange.

199
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:02,240
Master,

200
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:03,880
what are you worried about?

201
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:07,630
Do you remember

202
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,560
the warning left by the Sword Sovereign before his passing?

203
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,970
Feng Xingtian has cultivated

204
00:14:14,010 --> 00:14:15,800
the demonic magic from the Millennium Token,

205
00:14:16,640 --> 00:14:18,360
but was backlashed by it.

206
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:20,320
The Sword Sovereign determined that

207
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,160
the one who obtains this demonic power

208
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,800
must borrow someone else's body to cultivate this skill

209
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:25,920
and succeed.

210
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,280
If this is indeed the case,

211
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:31,120
now

212
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,800
the snow demon has just been subdued,

213
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:36,540
and that Phoenix-masked woman has suddenly appeared in the world again.

214
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:41,000
If there really is someone plotting and manipulating behind the scenes,

215
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:45,160
then the catastrophe that the Sword Sovereign spoke of years ago

216
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:48,040
may truly be coming.

217
00:14:49,880 --> 00:14:50,400
Master,

218
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,440
let me go.

219
00:14:51,840 --> 00:14:52,520
Whether the Phoenix-masked woman,

220
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:54,080
is really Feng Lixue

221
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:57,080
or is there someone truly manipulating things behind the scenes,

222
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:58,200
if I go,

223
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,000
I'll find out soon enough.

224
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,360
Mo Xiao,

225
00:15:07,040 --> 00:15:08,120
you must remember,

226
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:12,000
Feng Lixue is your destined calamity.

227
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,120
You must not let the incident of her falling off the cliff years ago

228
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,360
cause you to feel guilty and uneasy,

229
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:18,240
planting the seeds of disaster.

230
00:15:20,840 --> 00:15:21,280
Yes,

231
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:23,360
I know what to do.

232
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:27,640
If she, like her father,

233
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,080
has entered the path of evil and practiced demonic magic,

234
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,680
you must eliminate her.

235
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:34,870
I understand, Master.

236
00:15:35,520 --> 00:15:38,810
I've ordered the traps in Demon Subduing Palace to be deactivated.

237
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,080
Perhaps...

238
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,680
I may have wrongly accused Wu Chen after all.

239
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:46,660
Go to Demon Subduing Palace and bring her out.

240
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,200
Make sure she's properly taken care of.

241
00:15:49,480 --> 00:15:50,000
Yes, Master.

242
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:00,890
(Demon Subduing Palace)

243
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:08,590
Wu Chen.

244
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,720
Wu Chen.

245

I'll have Zisu apply medicine for you first.

313
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,440
Young Sect Leader, your back...

314
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:17,360
What happened to your back?

315
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:17,880
It's nothing.

316
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:18,910
Just a minor injury.

317
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:19,760
Zisu.

318
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,720
Take care of Miss Wu Chen first.

319
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:23,880
I'd better apply medicine for you first.

320
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:24,440
No rush.

321
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:25,440
I have something else to do.

322
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:26,960
Take care of Wu Chen first.

323
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,920
Where are you going?

324
00:18:37,080 --> 00:18:38,040
Drink this.

325
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:41,880
If you dislike me so much,

326
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:44,360
you don't have to take care of me.

327
00:18:44,640 --> 00:18:46,720
I'm just following the Young Sect Leader's orders.

328
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:48,000
It has nothing to do with whether I like you or not.

329
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,600
You don't like me,

330
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:53,400
but you like Mo Xiao, don't you?

331
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,240
What nonsense are you talking about?

332
00:18:56,640 --> 00:18:57,880
I am the Young Sect Leader's guardian.

333
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:59,560
I've been by the Young Sect Leader's side since childhood.

334
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:02,970
This is my honor as a disciple of the Shushan Sect.

335
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,600
There's no personal feelings involved.

336
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:06,840
Your expression now,

337
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,480
and your demeanor,

338
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:11,400
are just like what's described in my storybooks.

339
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,320
You dislike me because Mo Xiao takes care of and protects me,

340
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,680
so you don't like me.

341
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,480
When I just asked you,

342
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,960
you looked like you'd seen a ghost.

343
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:24,110
You dare not admit it,

344
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,560
nor are you honest about it.

345
00:19:26,070 --> 00:19:27,680
Your heart

346
00:19:28,760 --> 00:19:29,640
is stifled.

347
00:19:31,040 --> 00:19:32,960
You only read those supernatural novels.

348
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:34,480
now you've learned all this damn nonsense.

349
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,280
Actually,

350
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,440
he knows.

351
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:39,240
Who?

352
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:41,120
Who knows?

353
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:42,840
Mo Xiao.

354
00:19:43,280 --> 00:19:44,680
Mo Xiao knows.

355
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,040
However,

356
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,920
he pretends not to know.

357
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:52,520
It's because he doesn't want you to say it out loud.

358
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:54,440
I think so too.

359
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,720
You'd better not say it.

360
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:59,160
It's better to keep it in your heart.

361
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:01,360
It's none of your business.

362
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,920
Why should I listen to your nonsense?

363
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,680
Because

364
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:08,000
I'm the one he likes.

365
00:20:09,080 --> 00:20:10,970
All his behavior

366
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,320
is just like in the novels.

367
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:16,920
He must like me.

368
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:17,820
You...

369
00:20:17,930 --> 00:20:19,230
Aren't you ashamed?

370
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,770
Phoenix-masked woman.

371
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,680
Greetings, Supreme Lord.

372
00:21:07,880 --> 00:21:10,480
Supreme Lord, you rang the Suyu Cauldron to summon everyone here.

373
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:13,240
Is it about the reappearance of the Heavenly Secret Manual in the mortal world?

374
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,120
It seems

375
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,920
everyone's information

376
00:21:19,880 --> 00:21:21,080
is quite up-to-date.

377
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:23,280
Supreme Lord, I wonder if you

378
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,560
have any plans.

379
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:32,800
Back then

380
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,210
our Heavenly Demon Clan

381
00:21:34,280 --> 00:21:35,790
fought a great battle against the immortal sects.

382
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:39,320
The Heavenly Demon Token was shattered during the battle,

383
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:41,260
transforming into three Sacred Stones

384
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,280
that were lost at the foot of Mount Buzhou.

385
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,290
One of them, the Stone of Love and Desire,

386
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,960
Yeyuan

387
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,360
passed it on to me.

388
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:51,540
The other two,

389
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:54,280
the Stone of Asura and the Stone of Insatiability, went missing.

390
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:56,600
It is rumored that

391
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,860
Feng Xingtian, the leader of the Tianxing Sect,

392
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,960
has collected all the rare treasures in the world.

393
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:02,440
If

394
00:22:02,840 --> 00:22:04,430
our two Sacred Stones

395
00:22:04,600 --> 00:22:06,240
are in the Heavenly Secret Manual,

396
00:22:06,960 --> 00:22:08,480
shouldn't we

397
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,520
bring our Sacred Stones back?

398
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,600
Supreme Lord, since you have this plan,

399
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,120
why not let me go to retrieve the Sacred Stones?

400
00:22:21,710 --> 00:22:23,460
Star Lord Ji has already volunteered.

401
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,960
Star Lord Xuyan,

402
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,360
Elder Minghuang,

403
00:22:26,680 --> 00:22:27,840
what are your thoughts?

404
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:29,640
Supreme Lord, you have your own plans.

405
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,280
We will follow your instructions.

406
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,000
I agree with Star Lord Xuyan.

407
00:22:35,640 --> 00:22:37,600
We await your orders.

408
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:40,440
If that's the case,

409
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:41,560
very well.

410
00:22:42,440 --> 00:22:43,080
Chang Ming.

411
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:45,640
Yes, Supreme Lord.

412
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:47,040
Please take the trouble

413
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,160
to go to the Thousand Island Ice Lake

414
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,720
and bring back our Sacred Stones.

415
00:22:49,880 --> 00:22:50,520
That's not appropriate,

416
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:55,680
Supreme Lord.

417
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,640
The Sacred Stones are related to the Heavenly Demon Token.

418
00:22:57,840 --> 00:22:59,120
They are sacred artifacts of our people.

419
00:22:59,840 --> 00:23:02,440
Guardian Chang Ming has only been in our sect for a mere decade or so,

420
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:04,840
and moreover, he is not of our kind.

421
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,920
Regarding the retrieval of the Sacred Stones,

422
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:08,800
it would be more appropriate for me to go.

423
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,410
I, Chongguang,

424
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,400
am not even from the Heavenly Demon Clan.

425
00:23:17,040 --> 00:23:18,320
According to your logic,

426
00:23:18,520 --> 00:23:19,720
the position of Supreme Lord

427
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,800
should also be relinquished and returned to you,

428
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,460
right?

429
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:31,770
I have no such intention.

430
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,520
I think

431
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:36,880
that's exactly what you mean.

432
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:50,440
Supreme Lord, are you

433
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,160
going to kill me, the Dark Soul Star Lord, for this?

434
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:10,360
I promised Yeyuan

435
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,680
not to kill people from your Heavenly Demon Clan.

436
00:24:14,600 --> 00:24:15,600
I won't kill you.

437
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:18,720
Don't be afraid.

438
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:21,080
Come back.

439
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:29,520
This journey to the Thousand Island Ice Lake

440
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,320
will inevitably lead to confrontations with the immortal sects

441
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:32,760
and various factions in the martial world.

442
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:34,830
Star Lord Ji

443
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:37,320
is concerned that Guardian Chang Ming might be outnumbered.

444
00:24:37,760 --> 00:24:39,920
She wants to lend Guardian Chang Ming a hand.

445
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,630
Star Lord Xuyuan's words are quite right.

446
00:24:42,960 --> 00:24:46,440
Guardian Chang Ming has followed the Supreme Lord for over a decade.

447
00:24:46,520 --> 00:24:48,240
He is also the Supreme Lord's right-hand man.

448
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:50,960
It's most appropriate for him to go.

449
00:24:51,420 --> 00:24:52,170
Isn't that right?

450
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:53,880
Star Lord Ji?

451
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:58,530
Star Lord Xuyuan,

452
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:01,560
as expected of the former consort of the Supreme Lord,

453
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,260
your words are appropriate,

454
00:25:03,480 --> 00:25:05,760
and your perspective is particularly insightful.

455
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,170
Star Lord Ji,

456
00:25:07,690 --> 00:25:10,530
you should learn more from Star Lord Xuyuan.

457
00:25:11,480 --> 00:25:14,120
In the future, be more cautious with your words and actions.

458
00:25:14,520 --> 00:25:16,530
Saying things like "not of our kind"

459
00:25:16,680 --> 00:25:17,800
here

460
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:20,520
might offend many people.

461
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:24,710
I humbly obey your admonition.

462
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,040
Please forgive me, Supreme Lord.

463
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:28,560
I have been gone for so long.

464
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,960
The incense before Yeyuan's memorial tablet in Yaoling Palace

465
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,360
might need to be renewed.

466
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:34,720
Please continue discussing the clan matters at your leisure.

467
00:25:34,840 --> 00:25:36,440
I'm takeing my leave first.

468
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,710
Since I inherited the position of Supreme Lord,

469
00:25:52,280 --> 00:25:53,600
Star Lord Xuyuan

470
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,360
has rarely participated in clan affairs.

471
00:25:57,000 --> 00:25:58,200
Is it because

472
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,580
she can't stand to see me

473
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:02,240
in Yeyuan's position?

474
00:26:03,610 --> 00:26:04,700
Star Lord Xuyuan

475
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:05,810
first lost her husband,

476
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,920
then lost her beloved son.

477
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:08,160
She's simply disheartened.

478
00:26:08,210 --> 00:26:09,840
It's not that she disrespects you.

479
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:13,540
You've been

480
00:26:13,720 --> 00:26:15,400
talking behind my back too, haven't you?

481
00:26:18,880 --> 00:26:19,920
It doesn't matter.

482
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,400
What I need to do

483
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:24,520
has never been about conspiring with the likes of you.

484
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:39,680
(Thousand Island Ice Lake)

485
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:40,050
Tongming Island is the king of ten thousand islands,
(Thousand Island Ice Lake)

486
00:26:40,050 --> 00:26:41,720
Tongming Island is the king of ten thousand islands,

487
00:26:42,120 --> 00:26:44,710
floating among the archipelago of the Thousand Island Ice Lake.

488
00:26:44,880 --> 00:26:46,240
Its shape changes unpredictably,

489
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,890
and its floating pattern is erratic.

490
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,120
Few people in the world have set foot on it.

491
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:58,020
There's a masked person in the hall.

492
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:01,040
He said the Shushan Sect wants to kill me.

493
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:02,940
He wants to take me away.

494
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,190
(The Heavenly Secret Manual on Tongming Island)

495
00:27:07,790 --> 00:27:09,420
Could it be the same person?

496
00:27:10,370 --> 00:27:12,560
But how could she break into the Demon Subduing Palace of Shushan Sect?

497
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:14,420
That's impossible.

498
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,500
(Thousand Island Ice Lake)

499
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:39,560
Supreme Lord,

500
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,200
it seems Star Lord Ji has already made a move.

501
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,800
Among the three Sacred Stones of the Heavenly Demon Clan.

502
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,440
two of them are lost outside.

503
00:27:50,160 --> 00:27:52,120
The only remaining one, the Stone of Love and Desire,

504
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:55,040
is in my possession.

505
00:27:56,440 --> 00:27:58,000
They've been envious for so many years.

506
00:27:58,390 --> 00:28:00,800
Now that they've finally learned about one of them,

507
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,960
it's natural for them to take action.

508
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:06,140
Should I go and stop them?

509
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:07,520
No need.

510
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:12,080
We also need to find all three Sacred Stones.

511
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,960
As long as she doesn't cause trouble,

512
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:15,070
let her be.

513
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:16,920
Supreme Lord, once you gather all three Sacred Stones

514
00:28:17,040 --> 00:28:17,920
and restores the Heavenly Demon Token,

515
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:18,800
at that time,

516
00:28:19,000 --> 00:28:21,600
the great cause in your heart will be within reach.

517
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:29,150
By the way, Supreme Lord,

518
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,920
to retrieve the Sacred Stones,

519
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:32,880
we still need Yeyuan's bloodline.

520
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,240
Chang Ming,

521
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,720
you've followed me for so many years.

522
00:28:47,040 --> 00:28:47,850
What you should know

523
00:28:47,880 --> 00:28:48,880
and what you shouldn't know,

524
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,480
do I still need to remind you?

525
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,030
I understand my mistake.

526
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:53,720
I will go to the Thousand Island Ice Lake immediately

527
00:28:53,750 --> 00:28:55,320
to retrieve the Sacred Stones for you, Supreme Lord.

528
00:28:56,680 --> 00:28:57,200
Go then.

529
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,520
This journey down the mountain is of great importance.

530
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,120
It's also a good opportunity for training.

531
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,200
I...

532
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,920
I'd rather not go.

533
00:29:16,520 --> 00:29:17,040
Why?

534
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,900
I've always been responsible for guarding the four gates of Shushan Sect.

535
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,010
I rarely participate

536
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,520
in sect affairs outside the four gates.

537
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:24,960
I have even less interaction with the Young Sect Leader.

538
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,560
I don't want my fellow disciples

539
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,440
to say I'm currying favor with the Young Sect Leader.

540
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,080
You are the dignified

541
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:34,120
young master of the Fengyu Branch.

542
00:29:34,690 --> 00:29:39,040
You're also one of the future leaders of the four branches of Shushan Sect.

543
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:41,320
Why should you care about

544
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,880
other people's idle gossip?

545
00:29:44,200 --> 00:29:45,710
Where is Mo Xiao going?

546
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:47,350
if he's not going, I'll go.

547
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:48,440
Father,

548
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:49,440
if brother isn't going,

549
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:50,890
please let me go.

550
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:52,560
They've all been down the mountain for training.

551
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:55,480
I'm the only one who hasn't been anywhere.

552
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,160
Do you know where they're going this time?

553
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:00,160
This trip down the mountain is of great importance.

554
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:03,320
This journey is not like the usual demon-slaying missions.

555
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:04,840
As for you,

556
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:07,200
practice your Pagoda Bell well.

557
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,720
When your cultivation has greatly improved,

558
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:10,920
I promise you

559
00:30:11,280 --> 00:30:14,040
I'll personally take you down the mountain to experience the world.

560
00:30:14,800 --> 00:30:15,320
Father,

561
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:17,960
the Young Sect Leader is traveling in disguise this time,

562
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,480
just to gather information first.

563
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,640
When Shushan Sect needs to intervene,

564
00:30:21,800 --> 00:30:23,280
as the young master of the Fengyu Branch,

565
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,320
I will certainly go down the mountain to face the challenge without hesitation.

566
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,380
But before that,

567
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,640
I'd rather not go.

568
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,920
If my sister wants to go, let her go.

569
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:37,920
You two.

570
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,760
Neither of you gives me peace of mind.

571
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,460
Fine.

572
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,120
Since you're unwilling to accompany the Young Sect Leader,

573
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,080
be prepared at any time

574
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:51,600
to descend the mountain and quell the chaos.

575
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:52,640
Yes.

576
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,440
Father,

577
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:03,520
just tell me where you're going first.

578
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:05,320
You're not allowed to go anywhere.

579
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:06,560
Stay obediently at home.

580
00:31:06,920 --> 00:31:07,900
I have matters to attend to.

581
00:31:13,420 --> 00:31:14,780
If you don't tell me,

582
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:17,280
I'll find out myself.

583
00:31:33,160 --> 00:31:33,910
(Thousand Island Ice Lake)

584
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:55,640
Why is there a mask here?

585
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,210
Who are you?

586
00:32:14,650 --> 00:32:15,740
Who are you?

587
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:17,830
I am Wu Chen.

588
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,490
I am Murong Jing,

589
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:21,920
the young master of Fengyu Branch.

590
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:23,740
Where is Mo Xiao?

591
00:32:25,050 --> 00:32:27,170
You call him Mo Xiao?

592
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:29,120
Are you two close?

593
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,960
So you are the demon...

594
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,640
Brought back by Mo Xiao from Mang Mountain?

595
00:32:37,320 --> 00:32:38,120
An orphan girl, right?

596
00:32:39,460 --> 00:32:41,560
We grew up together in the Shushan Sect.

597
00:32:41,640 --> 00:32:42,480
Of course we're close.

598
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:46,220
But Mo Xiao said he's been in Xuanqing Court all along,

599
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,810
secluded in cultivation.

600
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:48,760
You were there too?

601
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,240
None of your business.

602
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:54,160
Why should I tell you about our Shushan Sect's affairs?

603
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:55,680
Where's Mo Xiao?

604
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:56,360
I'm looking for him.

605
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,160
You like him,

606
00:32:59,240 --> 00:32:59,800
don't you?

607
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:01,780
What are you talking about?

608
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,800
It's obvious that you

609
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,320
want to appear special to him.

610
00:33:08,080 --> 00:33:10,560
But I advise you to quietly let it go.

611
00:33:11,320 --> 00:33:12,440
Otherwise,

612
00:33:12,600 --> 00:33:14,360
you'll end up heartbroken too.

613
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,110
I don't understand what you're saying.

614
00:33:18,210 --> 00:33:19,210
What do you mean by letting go?

615
00:33:19,810 --> 00:33:20,970
What heartbreak are you talking about?

616
00:33:21,790 --> 00:33:24,690
The person he likes is me.

617
00:33:25,680 --> 00:33:26,720
You?

618
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:30,120
You...

619
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:32,300
Have you no shame?

620
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,040
It seems

621
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,860
getting you to give up

622
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,560
is going to be quite troublesome.

623
00:33:43,970 --> 00:33:45,200
Mo Xiao.

624
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:48,880
Mo Xiao.

625
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:00,440
People in the world.

626
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,000
Move aside.

627
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,920
This is my seat.

628
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,800
I always sit here when I come to Tiance Villa.

629
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:17,760
Get up.

630
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:20,840
But...

631
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,219
Mo Xiao taught me to read and write,

632
00:34:23,280 --> 00:34:24,679
and it was all here.

633
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:26,639
This spot is mine now.

634
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:28,310
Mo Xiao,

635
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:29,159
right?

636
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:32,679
Mo Xiao.

637
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:33,920
Look at her.

638
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
I finally made it.

639
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:39,719
Lingyun,

640
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,800
you came just in time.

641
00:34:41,159 --> 00:34:41,960
Give me your opinion.

642
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,280
Don't I always sit here whenever I come to Tiance Villa?

643
00:34:44,690 --> 00:34:46,350
Why should she take my spot?

644
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,239
Have you forgotten

645
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,719
what you came here for today?

646
00:34:52,210 --> 00:34:53,260
Mo Xiao,

647
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,760
you promised to take me to the Thousand Island Ice Lake.

648
00:34:58,400 --> 00:34:59,160
Mo Xiao,

649
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,310
are you leaving again?

650
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:06,680
Young Sect Leader.

651
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:08,200
The Sect Leader requests your presence.

652
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:08,720
Coming.

653
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:14,440
Brother Mo Xiao.

654
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,920
Promise me first.

655
00:35:21,770 --> 00:35:22,770
Mo Xiao is here.

656
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:23,960
Master.

657
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:24,880
Uncle Master.

658
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:26,600
Junior Murong.

659
00:35:26,840 --> 00:35:28,280
You'd better tell him.

660
00:35:28,600 --> 00:35:29,040
Alright.

661
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,520
Mo Xiao.

662
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,360
We Fengyu Branch just received news.

663
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:34,880
The former members of the Tianxing Sect in Fengdu City

664
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,800
have shown signs of regrouping.

665
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:39,400
Especially Feng Xingtian's

666
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:41,600
personal Guardian, Po Yun.

667
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,320
This could be a potential threat

668
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:47,680
to our Shushan Sect.

669
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,280
I will prepare to depart immediately

670
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:50,280
and do my best to stop them.

671
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:51,720
Good.

672
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:55,440
Jing.

673
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,840
I won't sit there anymore.

674
00:35:58,160 --> 00:35:59,080
You can have that seat.

675
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:00,160
No need.

676
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:02,120
Let bygones be bygones.

677
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:03,080
I won't argue with you.

678
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:05,240
Anyway, I'm going with Mo Xiao

679
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,560
to the Thousand Island Ice Lake.

680
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:08,080
You can have the seat.

681
00:36:08,440 --> 00:36:09,410
It's okay.

682
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:11,320
He'll take me with him when he goes out.

683
00:36:12,340 --> 00:36:13,460
Take you?

684
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:16,560
All you do is scare people and cause trouble.

685
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:17,560
You're not even helpful.

686
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:19,120
What's the point of taking you along?

687
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:21,940
That's where you're wrong.

688
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:24,960
If it were just about being helpful,

689
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:26,440
we'd just be friends

690
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:27,960
and brothers.

691
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:30,720
Listen, Wu Chen,

692
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:32,000
I lent you those storybooks

693
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:33,550
because I was worried you'd be bored in Xuanqing Court.

694
00:36:33,580 --> 00:36:34,960
They were just to help you pass the time.

695
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,880
I didn't expect you to learn so quickly.

696
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:39,120
Why are you using it all on Jing?

697
00:36:39,800 --> 00:36:40,680
Exactly.

698
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:42,600
You actually believe what's in those storybooks?

699
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,040
-Childish.
-But Jing...

700
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,080
I'm not afraid of you causing me trouble.

701
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:49,440
Mo Xiao?

702
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,050
Don't be in such a hurry.

703
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,760
I'll go check it out.

704
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:07,200
Mo Xiao.

705
00:37:07,880 --> 00:37:08,520
Has something happened?

706
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,480
Is there still no news from Shi Bujiu?

707
00:37:10,560 --> 00:37:12,040
It should happen within a day or two.

708
00:37:12,160 --> 00:37:12,920
Can't wait any longer?

709
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,040
I'm afraid I can't wait any longer.

710
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,090
The situation is urgent.

711
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:18,040
I must set off immediately for Thousand Island Ice Lake.

712
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:18,600
Alright.

713
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,480
I'll go with you.

714
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:20,360
You can't go.

715
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:20,920
Why?

716
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,960
Are we still brothers or not?

717
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:25,400
Last time you went to Mang Mountain,

718
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,120
you tricked me out of a whole bag of gold leaves.

719
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,080
I don't care.

720
00:37:28,200 --> 00:37:29,600
This time, no matter what, you have to take me with you.

721
00:37:29,720 --> 00:37:30,720
Master ordered me,

722
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,320
to take the Third Guardian down the mountain discreetly.

723
00:37:32,340 --> 00:37:33,960
How can we be discreet if I take you along?

724
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,200
Be honest,

725
00:37:35,500 --> 00:37:37,400
who is more suitable than me

726
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:38,760
to be your guide when you go down the mountain?

727
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,320
No.

728
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,800
You, I have another task for you.

729
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,440
What is it?

730
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:42,920
Take care of Wu Chen.

731
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:44,080
Me again?

732
00:37:46,470 --> 00:37:48,200
Did you forget last time you entrusted her to me?

733
00:37:48,220 --> 00:37:48,920
And what happened?

734
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:50,040
Do you still trust me?

735
00:37:50,600 --> 00:37:52,640
So this time you can make up for it.

736
00:37:52,680 --> 00:37:53,240
Come on.

737
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:55,040
I'm afraid I'll just make more mistakes.

738
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:57,160
Otherwise,

739
00:37:57,480 --> 00:37:58,440
why don't you take her along too?

740
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:00,520
That's not appropriate.

741
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,520
Although this trip is called a journey,

742
00:38:02,640 --> 00:38:03,800
I'm actually going to investigate

743
00:38:04,120 --> 00:38:05,960
the reason for the reappearance of the Heavenly Secret Manual.

744
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:07,400
Taking Wu Chen along

745
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,240
would be very inconvenient.

746
00:38:08,370 --> 00:38:10,150
Then just leave her at the Tiance Villa.

747
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:12,010
Her cold ailment is not yet cured.

748
00:38:12,200 --> 00:38:13,200
Leaving her in the villa

749
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:14,260
is not a suitable solution.

750
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:17,840
Who told you to bring back such trouble?

751
00:38:21,610 --> 00:38:22,400
How about

752
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:23,650
entrusting her to Murong Jing?

753
00:38:24,680 --> 00:38:25,430
Look,

754
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:27,520
if the Third Guardian and I go with you,

755
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:28,700
there will be no one left.

756
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:30,530
Jing is at least a girl,

757
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:32,280
so it would be convenient for her to take care of Wu Chen.

758
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:33,760
Young Master Xie,

759
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,520
you seem to enjoy watching the commotion.

760
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:37,640
Look at them.

761
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,880
No way.

762
00:38:39,640 --> 00:38:41,560
You won't argue anymore?

763
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:44,040
Xie Lingyun, what kind of lousy idea did you come up with?

764
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:46,160
We agreed to go to Thousand Island Ice Lake together.

765
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:48,680
You're doing this to clear yourself and sell me out...

766
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:49,840
I'm doing this for your own good...

767
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:50,800
How is this for my own good?

768
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,640
-Cut it out.
-Why don’t you understand?

769
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,640
Stop right there!

770
00:39:00,470 --> 00:39:01,860
You heard what I just

771
00:39:02,480 --> 00:39:03,360
said to him?

772
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,440
I heard everything.

773
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,960
You're going to leave me alone again this time.

774
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:11,590
Mo Xiao,

775
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,220
this is already the third time.

776
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:16,850
Do you really think

777
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:18,720
I'm a burden?

778
00:39:19,560 --> 00:39:21,250
I've never thought of you as a burden.

779
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,220
I've read it in the storybooks.

780
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,880
Things don't happen more than three times.

781
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:26,540
The first two times

782
00:39:27,050 --> 00:39:28,800
were perhaps out of necessity,

783
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:30,680
but if there's a third time,

784
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:33,520
you really want to get rid of me.

785
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:34,280
No, that's not it.

786
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:36,520
Who told you all this?

787
00:39:36,540 --> 00:39:38,840
Don't change the subject anymore.

788
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,000
If you really think I'm a burden,

789
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,200
just tell me,

790
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:45,360
and I'll leave.

791
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:46,120
I didn't.

792
00:39:46,680 --> 00:39:47,840
I never thought you were...

793
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:53,000
Wu Chen,

794
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:54,840
actually, at first,

795
00:39:55,120 --> 00:39:56,160
I brought you to Shushan Sect

796
00:39:56,640 --> 00:39:57,920
to cure your cold syndrome.

797
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:00,640
After I find a famous doctor to cure your cold syndrome,

798
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,120
I will send you down the mountain to find a peaceful place.

799
00:40:04,120 --> 00:40:05,440
I never said

800
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:07,160
I would take you to travel in the martial arts world.

801
00:40:07,320 --> 00:40:07,960
Alright,

802
00:40:08,560 --> 00:40:09,560
I understand.

803
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:12,480
No matter what you say, you want me to leave.

804
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:14,430
You're not in Shushan Sect,

805
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,960
there's no use for me to stay here.

806
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,550
Then I'll leave.

807
00:40:17,640 --> 00:40:18,680
I'll leave right now.

808
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:19,570
Well.

809
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:20,800
Wu Chen...

810
00:40:49,000 --> 00:40:49,960
That's not right.

811
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,090
Isn't it written in the storybook that

812
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:54,000
if I get angry like this,

813
00:40:54,490 --> 00:40:56,240
he will come after me?

814
00:41:04,840 --> 00:41:06,600
Mo Xiao won't take us.

815
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,120
What should we do?

816
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,320
He won't take you,

817
00:41:11,480 --> 00:41:13,320
but he will definitely take me.

818
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,800
Why would he take you and not me?

819
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:20,240
I am Young Master Xie.

820
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:22,680
I'm considered an old hand in the martial arts world.

821
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:24,440
Taking me along would be somewhat useful.

822
00:41:24,840 --> 00:41:25,640
Unlike you.

823
00:41:25,720 --> 00:41:27,160
You're just a pampered young lady.

824
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:29,080
Besides, your Fengyu Branch only knows how to relay messages.

825
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,640
You don't know how to do anything else.

826
00:41:30,880 --> 00:41:32,320
Taking you along would just be a hassle.

827
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:33,200
Do you understand?

828
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,820
I am the young master of the Fengyu Branch.

829
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:38,840
How dare you make me sound worthless?

830
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:39,880
Don't tell me

831
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:41,370
you want to compete with me?
