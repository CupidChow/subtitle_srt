00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:35,700
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,690
(Episode 34)

3
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:50,280
I knew you weren't really dead.

4
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:52,039
Why did you refuse to wake up?

5
00:01:52,039 --> 00:01:52,880
See?

6
00:01:53,120 --> 00:01:55,320
Turns out it was a mass of resentment energy

7
00:01:55,320 --> 00:01:57,039
blocking your chest.

8
00:01:57,520 --> 00:01:58,160
Mo Xiao,

9
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,040
you could have cleared your meridians yourself.

10
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:03,200
But you just lay there like a corpse.

11
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,090
It's like you wanted to die.

12
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:24,170
No need to say it.

13
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,460
I know what you want to ask—

14
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:27,800
"Where am I?

15
00:02:28,600 --> 00:02:30,300
How did I end up here?"

16
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,110
Right?

17
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,740
It's a long story.

18
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,060
Such a big incident

19
00:02:35,079 --> 00:02:36,720
happened in Shushan Sect.

20
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,850
They want the whole world to know.

21
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,010
Now, both the demonic

22
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,810
and immortal sects are searching for you.

23
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:46,800
But they didn't expect

24
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,720
me to find you first.

25
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,130
Moreover,

26
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,960
I've already sealed your spiritual power and demonic power.

27
00:02:55,960 --> 00:02:57,000
So for now,

28
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:59,200
they won't be able to find you.

29
00:03:04,960 --> 00:03:06,480
Why did you save me?

30
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,000
You shouldn't have saved me.

31
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,290
Whether I should have saved you or not

32
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:15,400
was for me to decide.

33
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:16,990
Now,

34
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,230
your life

35
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:20,880
belongs to me.

36
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,120
From today on,

37
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:23,800
you should

38
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,079
stay here in this fishing village

39
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:27,190
and recover from your injuries.

40
00:03:27,880 --> 00:03:28,840
They won't

41
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,050
be able to

42
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:32,240
find this place.

43
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,110
You are my son.

44
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:42,990
Mo Xiao!

45
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:44,800
You are not a demon!

46
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,600
If he weren't the demon's son,

47
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,110
how could I have activated all three Sacred Stones?

48
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:51,480
He

49
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,300
is the demon's son.

50
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,400
Demon...

51
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:00,490
I never expected that after 18 years of cultivation,

52
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:05,360
I would discover that I am a demon in the end.

53
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:12,160
Even I want to kill myself,

54
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:15,790
but you saved me.

55
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:19,740
Ridiculous.

56
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,600
Ridiculous.

57
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:28,800
Mo Xiao.

58
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:30,400
Where are you going?

59
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,159
He's out.

60
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,220
You...

61
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,630
are you afraid of me?

62
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,130
You're afraid of me.

63
00:06:02,890 --> 00:06:04,470
Then come and hit me.

64
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:05,920
Kill me,

65
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,480
and you'll be vanquishing demons and upholding righteousness.

66
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:12,680
Do you see the demon mark on my forehead?

67
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:16,780
I am a demon.

68
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:19,230
If you kill me, you'll earn merit.

69
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,050
Each one of you will gain merit.

70
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:22,960
Kill me.

71
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:24,720
Hit me, kill me.

72
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,100
and I won't fight back.

73
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:27,540
Do it.

74
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:29,440
Do it!

75
00:06:29,460 --> 00:06:30,600
Hit me, kill me!

76
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,560
I won't fight back! Do it!

77
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:33,560
Is he insane?

78
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:36,600
Why aren't you taking action?

79
00:06:36,600 --> 00:06:38,050
What are you waiting for?

80
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:41,450
Do you know who I am?

81
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:42,909
I am a demon!

82
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,730
I am the son of the Demon Lord!

83
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,840
If you kill me, you will gain merit.

84
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,480
You will gain immense merit!

85
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:49,560
What are you waiting for?

86
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:50,400
Come on!

87
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,750
Do it!

88
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:54,870
What are you doing?

89
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,050
Is it fun bullying a sick person?

90
00:07:57,159 --> 00:07:58,320
Lil' Hammer,

91
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,160
you're old enough now.

92
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:01,840
Why do you still act like this?

93
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,520
You can't even finish a sentence

94
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,120
before you start waving the Spirit Serpent Staff.

95
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,080
You've been the Chief for so many years,

96
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:08,940
but you haven't improved one bit.

97
00:08:10,040 --> 00:08:11,440
Elder Wuxin,

98
00:08:11,960 --> 00:08:13,520
we haven't seen each other for years.

99
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:15,280
Why did you suddenly come back?

100
00:08:15,560 --> 00:08:16,820
Don't call me "Elder."

101
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:19,300
I haven't been your elder for a long time.

102
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:21,680
I'm now the Divine Healer, Shi Bujiu.

103
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,360
I have a patient

104
00:08:23,640 --> 00:08:25,360
who ended up in your fishing village,

105
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,440
and I had no choice

106
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:28,160
but to come back to treat him.

107
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:30,670
Lil' Hammer,

108
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:33,760
don't think I came back to see you.

109
00:08:34,280 --> 00:08:35,880
I have absolutely no interest

110
00:08:35,880 --> 00:08:37,159
in you, an old fart.

111
00:08:41,840 --> 00:08:42,559
It's him.

112
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:45,420
I had almost cured him,

113
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:47,400
but you almost killed him with your

114
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,800
Spirit Serpent Staff just now.

115
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:51,130
You have to take responsibility for this.

116
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:54,990
He's a person who wants to die.

117
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:57,100
Elder Wuxin, what's the point in saving him?

118
00:08:57,100 --> 00:08:58,040
I've told you

119
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,420
not to call me "Elder."

120
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:01,920
Also,

121
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,000
I'm saving him

122
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,700
because i want to.

123
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:08,440
Whether he wants to live or die is his business.

124
00:09:08,440 --> 00:09:10,400
Anyway, I have plenty of ways

125
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,680
to keep him alive.

126
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:12,880
Elder...

127
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,260
Call me Divine Healer!

128
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:17,960
Divine Healer? Nah.

129
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:19,850
I'll just call you "Elder."

130
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,160
Elder, Elder.

131
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,960
Elder Wuxin.

132
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,680
As you know,

133
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,650
we don't keep strangers in this fishing village.

134
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,880
This person has demonic energy in him.

135
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,040
He can't stay.

136
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:32,800
What?

137
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,880
He can't stay?

138
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:36,960
Lil' Hammer,

139
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,810
the upstream water system of Li River is complex,

140
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,500
yet he drifted right to your village.

141
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:46,640
That's fate.

142
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,000
And you're still not keeping him?

143
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:50,160
We can't keep him.

144
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:51,880
Lil' Hammer,

145
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,700
aren't you even curious about

146
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,480
who he is?

147
00:10:11,590 --> 00:10:13,440
He's a person looking to die.

148
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,760
It doesn't matter who he is anymore.

149
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,450
In the end, he'll just be a dead person anyway.

150
00:10:19,440 --> 00:10:20,560
What are you waiting for?

151
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,560
Throw this person out of the fishing village.

152
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,560
Okay! Let's do it!

153
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:25,080
Lil' Hammer,

154
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,200
are you trying to throw your weight around with me?

155
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,160
Don't forget,

156
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:31,480
back when you were butt-naked fishing in the river

157
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:34,150
and your dad was chasing you around with a stick,

158
00:10:34,280 --> 00:10:36,540
who was the one shielding you every time?

159
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:38,670
Now that you've become the stupid Chief,

160
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:40,530
you don't even respect me anymore?

161
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:42,710
Where are you taking him?

162
00:11:45,170 --> 00:11:45,970
Supreme Lord,

163
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:47,200
what's this?

164
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:51,320
This is the ceremonial attire for my wedding with Feng Lixue.

165
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,170
How is it?

166
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:53,240
Your wedding?

167
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:56,880
That day in the Ancestral Hall,

168
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:58,650
I declared before everyone

169
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:01,560
that Lixue would be my Supreme Consort.

170
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:06,000
But I still owe her a proper wedding ceremony.

171
00:12:06,360 --> 00:12:07,160
Supreme Lord,

172
00:12:07,280 --> 00:12:09,330
didn't you say you'd wait until the day you activate the Heavenly Demon Token

173
00:12:09,330 --> 00:12:11,160
and summon the hundred thousand demon soldiers

174
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:13,890
to hold a grand ceremony for the Supreme Consort?

175
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,820
That brat, Mo Xiao, has disappeared.

176
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:21,360
The Heavenly Demon Token cannot be activated for now.

177
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:22,400
Am I supposed to

178
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:25,280
keep postponing my wedding forever?

179
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,880
Supreme Lord, your wedding—

180
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,160
no matter when it happens—

181
00:12:29,160 --> 00:12:31,560
will always be a grand event for our Heavenly Demon Sect.

182
00:12:31,560 --> 00:12:32,720
However, Supreme Lord,

183
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,080
the four elders from the Seven Caves and Nine Netherworlds are here.

184
00:12:35,080 --> 00:12:36,160
I'm afraid that right now,

185
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,890
we need to deal with them first.

186
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,380
Where are they?

187
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:41,810
Right outside the hall.

188
00:12:44,640 --> 00:12:47,370
The Heavenly Demon Token hasn't been activated,

189
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,680
and now

190
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:52,010
there's news about Yeyuan's son from Shushan Mountain.

191
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,820
Naturally, they can't wait anymore.

192
00:12:55,400 --> 00:12:57,930
I just didn't expect them to be here this soon.

193
00:12:58,400 --> 00:12:59,080
Well...

194
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,640
shall we see them?

195
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,120
Yes.

196
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,040
Of course we'll see them.

197
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,600
Four Grand Elders,

198
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:12,480
your sudden visit today

199
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,210
must be because

200
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:17,210
you've heard the news about Yeyuan's son, right?

201
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:19,040
Supreme Lord, your insight is keen.

202
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:21,120
We indeed came for this matter.

203
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:24,880
Ever since we heard that Yeyuan's son is still alive,

204
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,120
and that he is actually the new Shushan Sect Leader, Mo Xiao,

205
00:13:28,120 --> 00:13:30,010
we were all shocked.

206
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,040
We also heard that

207
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,680
Mo Xiao was cast into the Dark River by Shushan Sect

208
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:34,960
and his fate is still unknown.

209
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:37,010
Now, the entire Shushan Sect

210
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:39,600
is searching for Mo Xiao all over the world.

211
00:13:40,280 --> 00:13:41,190
The day before yesterday,

212
00:13:41,190 --> 00:13:44,760
we received a secret letter from Star Lord Xuyuan of Yaoling Palace,

213
00:13:44,760 --> 00:13:48,240
asking us to join the search for Yeyuan's son.

214
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,040
The Seven Caves and Nine Netherworlds

215
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:53,680
are at a loss for what to do now.

216
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:56,970
We humbly request your instructions, Supreme Lord.

217
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,520
You've said so much,

218
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,120
but isn't it just to ask me

219
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:07,200
whether you should go look for Yeyuan's son?

220
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:09,200
The Seven Caves and Nine Netherworlds

221
00:14:09,200 --> 00:14:11,840
have always followed the Heavenly Demon Clan

222
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:14,000
and responded to the call of the Heavenly Demon Token.

223
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,800
But that day, in the Ancestral Hall,

224
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:18,400
you did not activate the Heavenly Demon Token.

225
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:19,520
Now that

226
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,600
the Young Supreme Lord has reappeared,

227
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,440
we don't know what we should do.

228
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,250
Therefore...

229
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:27,400
Enough.

230
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:30,170
What's there to be troubled about?

231
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,520
Since he is the Young Supreme Lord of the Heavenly Demon Sect,

232
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:34,720
then of course

233
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,360
we must find him and bring him back.

234
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,610
But Supreme Lord, have you considered

235
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:44,650
that if the Young Supreme Lord

236
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:46,600
returns to Mount Suyu,

237
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:49,440
your position as Demon Lord

238
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:51,600
might be at risk?

239
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,040
Indeed.

240
00:14:54,960 --> 00:14:56,360
Then what do you suggest?

241
00:14:58,440 --> 00:14:59,240
Supreme Lord,

242
00:14:59,960 --> 00:15:01,720
the Heavenly Demon Clan, Seven Caves, and Nine Netherworlds

243
00:15:01,720 --> 00:15:04,240
have always regarded the Heavenly Demon Token as the ultimate authority.

244
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:07,240
Right now, the Heavenly Demon Token is in your hands.

245
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:10,150
If you can activate it,

246
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:11,240
we

247
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:15,120
will naturally follow your lead, Supreme Lord.

248
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,210
But what if the Heavenly Demon Token

249
00:15:18,440 --> 00:15:20,240
can only be activated by Mo Xiao?

250
00:15:22,920 --> 00:15:23,720
Supreme Lord,

251
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,160
as I just said,

252
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,320
the Seven Caves and Nine Netherworlds

253
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:30,920
only regard the Heavenly Demon Token as the ultimate authority.

254
00:15:36,520 --> 00:15:37,340
I see.

255
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,760
So what you're saying is

256
00:15:41,160 --> 00:15:44,290
as long as Mo Xiao can activate the Heavenly Demon Token,

257
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:47,080
you'll follow him as the Supreme Lord,

258
00:15:47,830 --> 00:15:48,470
right?

259
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:55,400
Very well.

260
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,780
Since you're being so candid with me,

261
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,920
I'll tell you a secret.

262
00:16:04,350 --> 00:16:05,750
The Heavenly Demon Token

263
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,600
indeed can only be activated by

264
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,920
Mo Xiao, who is of Yeyuan's bloodline.

265
00:16:13,080 --> 00:16:14,840
But you should also know

266
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:16,240
that Mo Xiao

267
00:16:16,760 --> 00:16:18,560
is a disciple of an immortal sect

268
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:22,080
who was taught for years by the old man Fengyue.

269
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,460
Do you really think

270
00:16:24,400 --> 00:16:27,880
he will lead you to seize the Millennium Token

271
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:31,060
and strengthen our Heavenly Demon Sect?

272
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:10,660
So, this is the mysterious demonic power of the Millennium Token.

273
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,630
We swear to follow you to the death, Supreme Lord.

274
00:17:16,990 --> 00:17:17,710
Remember,

275
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,680
the only one who can seize the Millennium Token

276
00:17:21,599 --> 00:17:22,760
is me,

277
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:24,560
Chongguang.

278
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:27,160
Yes, Supreme Lord.

279
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:52,200
Lixue.

280
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:56,480
Lixue.

281
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:58,240
I am Yunchao.

282
00:18:01,320 --> 00:18:02,960
When will you wake up?

283
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:06,580
If you don't wake up soon,

284
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,720
you'll become the Supreme Consort.

285
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,780
By then, there'll be no turning back.

286
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:16,960
I never expected

287
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,450
that Mo Xiao

288
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,000
would be the brother

289
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:22,860
my mother and I had been searching for over a decade.

290
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:24,920
Turns out he's the son of Yeyuan.

291
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:28,000
But ever since that day,

292
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:31,080
when he was severely injured and fell off the cliff,

293
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:32,540
his fate has been unknown,

294
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,580
and we have no idea where he is.

295
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:36,600
Do you think

296
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,800
that if he's still alive,

297
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,220
when he hears about your wedding,

298
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:42,400
he'll come?

299
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:48,280
Star Envoy Xuyuan.

300
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:53,200
Why did you

301
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:54,650
come to Shaohao Palace?

302
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,900
Greetings, Supreme Lord.

303
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,480
I'm here to visit Li...

304
00:19:00,030 --> 00:19:01,690
To visit the Supreme Consort.

305
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:11,000
Your brother is missing.

306
00:19:11,650 --> 00:19:12,560
Star Lord Xuyuan

307
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:15,520
must be heartbroken.

308
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:20,320
Instead of staying home to comfort her,

309
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:23,040
you have time to visit the Supreme Consort?

310
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,840
Mother has fallen ill

311
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:28,040
from worrying about my brother.

312
00:19:28,040 --> 00:19:30,360
But I can't bear to watch her waste away,

313
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:32,120
so I've decided to go down the mountain to look for him.

314
00:19:32,120 --> 00:19:33,840
But I heard you're preparing

315
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,520
to hold the investiture ceremony for the Supreme Consort.

316
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:37,360
I'm afraid I won't be able to attend,

317
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:38,760
so I came to bid farewell.

318
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:41,760
I see.

319
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,040
However,

320
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:44,240
I don't think

321
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,200
you need to go through all this trouble.

322
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:52,720
The news that Lixue is about to become the Supreme Consort

323
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,480
has already spread throughout the world.

324
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:57,210
If your brother is still alive,

325
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,240
I believe

326
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,880
he will find a way to come to Mount Suyu.

327
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:05,120
You're trying to lure him out?

328
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:05,920
That's right.

329
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:09,240
Given your brother's current situation,

330
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,640
where else can he go

331
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,160
besides Mount Suyu?

332
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:15,000
Supreme Lord,

333
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:16,920
I appreciate your kindness.

334
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:18,740
But there are things I must do.

335
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,440
Farewell.

336
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,000
Lixue.

337
00:20:55,240 --> 00:20:57,370
it's time to try on the wedding attire.

338
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:10,330
Do you recognize it?

339
00:21:13,740 --> 00:21:14,990
Fengyue Sword.

340
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,720
Mo Xiao's Fengyue Sword.

341
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,520
I took it from him in front of the Demon Subduing Palace.

342
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:37,340
Now,

343
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:38,840
both Fengyue Sword and you

344
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,880
are here with me.

345
00:21:41,120 --> 00:21:42,020
I believe

346
00:21:42,520 --> 00:21:44,040
he will come to reclaim it.

347
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:48,440
However,

348
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:50,960
by the time he returns to Mount Suyu

349
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:52,880
and becomes the Young Supreme Lord,

350
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:55,080
you will already be my Supreme Consort.

351
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,960
Since the two of you know each other,

352
00:21:58,120 --> 00:21:58,880
why don't you

353
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:00,840
keep the sword

354
00:22:01,160 --> 00:22:02,760
for now?

355
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:06,400
When he returns to Mount Suyu,

356
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:09,320
we'll give it back to him together.

357
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:10,850
Alright?

358
00:22:24,520 --> 00:22:25,720
Lil' Hammer,

359
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:27,320
are you really so heartless?

360
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:29,250
Do you really want to drive him out?

361
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:31,040
Do you know that outside, those people

362
00:22:31,040 --> 00:22:31,960
are waiting with their nets,

363
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:33,720
waiting for this big fish to take the bait?

364
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:34,880
Do you know that?

365
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,240
Come on.

366
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:39,680
The men of our fishing village

367
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,240
never fall.

368
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:44,000
They all know

369
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,060
that seeking death is easier than seeking life,

370
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,840
and they will never allow themselves to be cowards.

371
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:54,530
Since you don't want to leave,

372
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:57,090
then learn how the men in our village

373
00:22:57,130 --> 00:22:58,570
fight for survival.

374
00:22:58,600 --> 00:22:59,400
You...

375
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,800
Alright, alright.

376
00:23:00,800 --> 00:23:01,760
I'm not talking to you.

377
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:03,490
I'm not talking to you anymore.

378
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,240
Mo Xiao,

379
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:06,400
how are you?

380
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,450
Are you alright?

381
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,200
One, two!

382
00:23:12,180 --> 00:23:14,570
One, two!

383
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:17,210
One, two!

384
00:23:18,420 --> 00:23:20,470
One, two!

385
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:22,960
One, two!

386
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:25,620
One, two!

387
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:28,250
One, two!

388
00:23:29,190 --> 00:23:31,310
One, two!

389
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:35,100
Be careful.

390
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:36,160
Make way, please.

391
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,960
Come on, have some water.

392
00:23:43,160 --> 00:23:44,990
Have some water and take a break.

393
00:23:47,970 --> 00:23:48,920
Thank you.

394
00:23:56,070 --> 00:23:57,470
Lil' Hammer,

395
00:23:57,640 --> 00:23:59,900
what are you doing with all these stones?

396
00:24:00,490 --> 00:24:02,310
Water and fire are ruthless.

397
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:04,080
The Li River,

398
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,570
though calm and still throughout the year,

399
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,690
still has its undercurrents.

400
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,000
By then, our Nüwa Clan

401
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:13,600
will lose our home.

402
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:16,080
How could we not prepare in advance?

403
00:24:46,410 --> 00:24:47,940
Send this to your father.

404
00:24:48,430 --> 00:24:50,230
-Alright.
-He's over there. Go.

405
00:24:53,230 --> 00:24:55,310
Dad, I brought you some water.

406
00:24:55,360 --> 00:24:57,200
Alright. I got it.

407
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,790
Quick, grab the rope!

408
00:25:42,650 --> 00:25:43,320
Kid!

409
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,270
It's dangerous! Get out of the way!

410
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:08,320
My son,

411
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,330
are you alright?

412
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,440
Quick, thank him.

413
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:12,530
Thank you.

414
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:13,490
Are you alright?

415
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:15,720
Thank you, thank you.

416
00:26:19,870 --> 00:26:21,360
Lil' Hammer,

417
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,400
you always have a way, don't you?

418
00:26:24,370 --> 00:26:26,650
I was indeed worried this kid

419
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,200
would just drift aimlessly,

420
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,330
wasting away in your fishing village.

421
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:31,920
Lil' Hammer,

422
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:34,760
you should know

423
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:38,040
that this kid has only ever held a sword.

424
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,330
He was raised as a Young Master.

425
00:26:40,400 --> 00:26:41,560
How could you bear

426
00:26:41,580 --> 00:26:43,640
to make him do this kind of hard labor?

427
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,750
If I'm not mistaken,

428
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,740
this kind of work

429
00:26:48,920 --> 00:26:50,120
is the punishment

430
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,640
for the men in your fishing village

431
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,770
who have committed serious offenses.

432
00:26:54,120 --> 00:26:57,240
Physical pain is better than heartache, isn't it?

433
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,100
Don't worry about him.

434
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:04,440
Lil' Hammer,

435
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:07,350
it's not even the rainy season yet,

436
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,960
and you've already gathered so many stones to build a fort in advance.

437
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:12,710
Is that really necessary?

438
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:14,320
When a storm is coming,

439
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,320
it doesn't care about the timing.

440
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,280
You...

441
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,600
Everyone, it's time to eat!

442
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,440
Time to eat.

443
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,650
You've all worked hard.

444
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,040
Come on, time to eat.

445
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:37,430
You've all worked hard.

446
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,280
Come on, let's eat.

447
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:44,210
They're all like hungry wolves.

448
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:45,690
Why are you hiding away?

449
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:48,680
If you don't come now, they'll eat everything.

450
00:27:49,320 --> 00:27:49,960
Thank you.

451
00:27:50,350 --> 00:27:51,210
I'm not eating.

452
00:27:51,860 --> 00:27:54,200
How can you do such heavy work without eating?

453
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,360
You must eat.

454
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:55,940
Here.

455
00:27:56,120 --> 00:27:57,180
Eat while it's hot.

456
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,540
Why did the Chief

457
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,410
have us start

458
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,640
to repair the dam so early this year?

459
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,720
What's it for?

460
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:05,900
What else could it be for?

461
00:28:05,900 --> 00:28:08,450
It's to give these strong men some work to do.

462
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,120
If we were not doing this,

463
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,120
we'd still fish.

464
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,160
It's not like we have nothing to do.

465
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,570
-Yes.
-That's right.

466
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:14,830
These days,

467
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:17,080
you can't fish.

468
00:28:17,550 --> 00:28:18,550
Why not?

469
00:28:18,830 --> 00:28:20,800
I heard from the people who patrol the river

470
00:28:20,800 --> 00:28:23,660
that the Demon Lord on Mount Suyu is having a wedding

471
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,510
and holding an investiture ceremony for the Supreme Consort.

472
00:28:25,510 --> 00:28:28,100
To welcome the elders from the Seven Caves and Nine Netherworlds

473
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,520
to Mount Suyu to offer congratulations,

474
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,160
all the fishing boats on Li River

475
00:28:31,160 --> 00:28:32,080
have been restricted.

476
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,080
They've been celebrating for days.

477
00:28:51,970 --> 00:28:57,910
♫This dream within a dream is so vivid. I see the outline of fate♫

478
00:28:58,770 --> 00:29:05,120
♫Three lifetimes of longing, I drink it still, indifferent to its bleakness♫

479
00:29:05,260 --> 00:29:11,940
♫Eyes hazy with untold desire, I see through the earthly ties♫

480
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:18,640
♫Love and hate swirl in a storm, each occupying its own part of the scene♫

481
00:29:18,660 --> 00:29:21,850
♫Pity the love that can't be spoken aloud♫

482
00:29:21,850 --> 00:29:25,100
♫Cross the bitter sea of hardship♫

483
00:29:25,130 --> 00:29:32,230
♫Persisting through life after life, unwilling to awaken♫

484
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:35,070
♫When the mist has cleared and the clouds have drifted away♫

485
00:29:35,100 --> 00:29:38,550
♫Our eternal bond shall find its way♫

486
00:29:38,570 --> 00:29:46,400
♫This love endures through days and years, lasting for all eternity♫

487
00:29:48,820 --> 00:29:55,050
♫After countless calamities, I fell in love with you at first sight♫

488
00:29:55,480 --> 00:30:04,930
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

489
00:30:04,930 --> 00:30:06,160
Give my orders:
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

490
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,210
♫The breeze carries promise, while rain brings sorrow, our fates intertwined across lifetimes♫

491
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:09,560
The Followers of the Heavenly Demon Sect

492
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,040
shall drink

493
00:30:11,840 --> 00:30:13,440
and be merry for three days.

494
00:30:41,160 --> 00:30:41,960
Supreme Lord,

495
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:44,040
the gate of Mount Suyu has lowered its guard,

496
00:30:44,040 --> 00:30:45,770
but there's still no movement.

497
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:48,600
No rush.

498
00:30:49,960 --> 00:30:52,620
We'll be drinking and having fun for three days.

499
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,940
We have plenty of time.

500
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,040
Star Lord,

501
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:00,770
please go back and rest.

502
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,220
If you keep waiting here,

503
00:31:02,220 --> 00:31:03,680
your health won't hold up.

504
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,980
Chongguang's high-profile wedding

505
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:08,600
is to lure him here.

506
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:11,800
My son is definitely not dead.

507
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,530
I'll be waiting for him.

508
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:16,110
Star Lord,

509
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:17,380
Tianxin has already arranged people

510
00:31:17,380 --> 00:31:19,120
to wait at the foot of Mount Suyu.

511
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:20,920
If the Young Supreme Lord really comes back,

512
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:22,960
the people down there will notify him.

513
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,140
Please go back and rest,

514
00:31:24,140 --> 00:31:24,860
alright?

515
00:31:26,040 --> 00:31:27,240
Don't worry about me.

516
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:31,440
Yes.

517
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:50,220
Lixue,

518
00:31:52,000 --> 00:31:53,490
are you happy

519
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:55,280
right now?

520
00:32:12,800 --> 00:32:13,640
Tell me,

521
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,480
are you happy?

522
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,100
That night at the Ghost Festival,

523
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:44,800
when I released a thousand lotus lanterns for you,

524
00:32:45,520 --> 00:32:47,040
I secretly made a wish.

525
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,000
If one day all the demons are vanquished

526
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:52,690
and my mission is complete,

527
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,610
I'll give you a sea of blooming flowers

528
00:32:56,080 --> 00:32:58,210
and three thousand glowing lanterns.

529
00:33:06,210 --> 00:33:07,740
I really want to go to a place

530
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,900
without the division between good and evil,

531
00:33:11,680 --> 00:33:13,440
without hatred or revenge,

532
00:33:14,840 --> 00:33:17,370
to live a few days where it's just the two of us.

533
00:34:04,440 --> 00:34:06,100
You've been awake for a while.

534
00:34:07,360 --> 00:34:08,070
What?

535
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,429
Do you hate me?

536
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,040
Do you resent me?

537
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,000
Do you want to kill me?

538
00:34:18,659 --> 00:34:19,340
Lixue,

539
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:21,760
as long as you're willing to wake up,

540
00:34:21,760 --> 00:34:23,159
I'm willing to bear

541
00:34:23,239 --> 00:34:25,060
all your resentment and hatred.

542
00:34:25,840 --> 00:34:28,560
I want you to see everything in front of you.

543
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,120
I want you to know clearly

544
00:34:31,580 --> 00:34:31,600
♫It all began the moment we met♫

545
00:34:31,600 --> 00:34:32,480
that you are now
♫It all began the moment we met♫

546
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,159
♫It all began the moment we met♫

547
00:34:33,159 --> 00:34:34,760
my Supreme Consort.
♫It all began the moment we met♫

548
00:34:35,850 --> 00:34:36,080
♫In that instant, my lifelong wish was set♫

549
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,420
Come on, Lixue,
♫In that instant, my lifelong wish was set♫

550
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:37,840
♫In that instant, my lifelong wish was set♫

551
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,040
wake up!
♫In that instant, my lifelong wish was set♫

552
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,960
♫The sorrow and joy in my love♫

553
00:34:41,989 --> 00:34:45,290
♫You need not bear them too♫

554
00:34:46,010 --> 00:34:47,469
♫No trial of love♫

555
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:48,730

♫No trial of love♫

557

♫Can bring me dread. I borrow courage from fate♫

558
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,800
♫Can bring me dread. I borrow courage from fate♫

559
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:52,719
Why won't you speak to me?
♫Can bring me dread. I borrow courage from fate♫

Do you mean that young man?

636
00:37:08,460 --> 00:37:09,040
Yes.

637
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:12,100
Didn't he go to the riverbank to move stones?

638
00:37:12,330 --> 00:37:14,590
They said he hasn't been seen since noon.

639
00:37:14,890 --> 00:37:16,390
Where could he have gone?

640
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:20,250
Could someone have said something to him?

641
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:21,740
Oh no!

642
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:39,520
Mo Xiao!

643
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:41,000
Mo Xiao!

644
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:43,520
Mo Xiao! Mo Xiao!

645
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:46,480
Mo Xiao! Mo Xiao!

646
00:37:57,560 --> 00:37:59,400
Mo Xiao! Mo Xiao!

647
00:38:00,940 --> 00:38:01,740
You're awake.

648
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:03,120
you're awake.

649
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,290
You scared me to death.

650
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,450
Do you have any idea

651
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:12,560
I've been looking for you all night?

652
00:38:12,560 --> 00:38:14,960
I nearly turned the whole fishing village upside down.

653
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:15,560
You...

654
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:17,720
Turns out you're here.

655
00:38:18,680 --> 00:38:21,310
You really scared me to death.

656
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:27,920
Mo Xiao.

657
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,380
You're crying?

658
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,320
Why?

659
00:38:33,480 --> 00:38:34,360
Say something.

660
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:38,240
Did you hear something?

661
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,800
I told them, didn't I?

662
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:44,240
You shouldn't have been

663
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,880
told about this right now.

664
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,920
You're still recovering.

665
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:49,000
Something like this

666
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,930
would be too much of a shock for you.

667
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,400
See?

668
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:55,320
Mo Xiao,

669
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,240
the dead cannot be brought back to life.

670
00:38:58,680 --> 00:38:59,730
You must move on.

671
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:03,960
Dead?

672
00:39:04,860 --> 00:39:06,390
What are you talking about?

673
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,690
Aren't you crying for your Master?

674
00:39:10,920 --> 00:39:12,260
My Master?

675
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,040
What happened to him?

676
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,220
Your Master, Yuan Beichen,

677
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:17,400
is dead.

678
00:39:20,280 --> 00:39:21,960
What nonsense are you talking about?

679
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,480
I'm not talking nonsense.

680
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,360
It's true.

681
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:29,240
My Master is dead?

682
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,840
How could my Master die?

683
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,460
How could my Master die?

684
00:39:35,460 --> 00:39:36,590
Why are you lying to me?

685
00:39:36,590 --> 00:39:37,870
I'm not lying to you.

686
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:41,080
Your Master Yuan Beichen really is dead.

687
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,320
I heard that

688
00:39:44,800 --> 00:39:46,750
of his two disciples,

689
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,270
one was the demon's son

690
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,000
and the other was demonized,

691
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:50,760
so

692
00:39:50,880 --> 00:39:53,770
Shushan Sect denounced him as a spy for the Demon Sect.

693
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,320
To atone for it,

694
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:57,340
your Master took his own life.

695
00:39:59,560 --> 00:40:00,440
Also,

696
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,160
the new Shushan Sect Leader, Murong Changfeng,

697
00:40:03,160 --> 00:40:05,070
has shut down Luntian Branch.

698
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:07,020
Yuan Beichen's body

699
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,350
is to be thrown into Ghost Valley,

700
00:40:09,960 --> 00:40:11,560
and all disciples of Luntian Branch

701
00:40:11,560 --> 00:40:13,560
are required to go there to keep vigil.

702
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,250
Don't you know any of this?

703
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:17,600
Then what are you crying for?

704
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,140
It's impossible.

705
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:22,400
It's impossible.

706
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:24,700
I'm going to go ask him myself.

707
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:25,790
Mo Xiao,

708
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:27,320
where are you going to do?

709
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,870
Where are you going?

710
00:41:02,440 --> 00:41:03,650
How did Shushan Sect

711
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:04,880
end up like this?

712
00:41:05,280 --> 00:41:07,350
Jing used to be such a lively girl.

713
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,520
Ever since the incident at Shushan Sect,

714
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,480
she's been

715
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:13,600
keeping to herself at Tielyv Branch, not saying a word.

716
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:14,880
Oh, my.

717
00:41:16,610 --> 00:41:17,410
This won't do.

718
00:41:17,720 --> 00:41:19,680
I need to have a word with Murong Changfeng.

719
00:41:19,680 --> 00:41:20,400
Don't go.

720
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,120
Junior,

721
00:41:22,240 --> 00:41:24,360
you've never been involved in sect affairs before.

722
00:41:24,360 --> 00:41:25,970
But this time is different.

723
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,640
Senior Yuan already took his own life to atone,

724
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:31,240
but Murong Changfeng still refuses to let it go.

725
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:31,680
No.

726
00:41:31,800 --> 00:41:33,080
I must stand up for him.

727
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:33,720
Senior.

728
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:37,560
Senior told us

729
00:41:37,720 --> 00:41:39,180
not to do anything for him.

730
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:41,280
He said it himself?

731
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,150
Could it be…
