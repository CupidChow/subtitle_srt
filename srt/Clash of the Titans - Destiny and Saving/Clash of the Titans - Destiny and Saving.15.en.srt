1
00:01:31,230 --> 00:01:35,700
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,770 --> 00:01:38,700
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:42,970 --> 00:01:44,680
Search every corner carefully.

4
00:01:44,680 --> 00:01:45,320
Yes.

5
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,600
Young Master Murong,

6
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:02,700
the islands on the Myriad Isles Ice Lake

7
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:04,250
are nearly identical.

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,660
Where should we begin?

9
00:02:06,330 --> 00:02:07,850
Search them one by one,

10
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:09,820
and check every inch of water.

11
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,040
Even if we have to turn the Myriad Isles Ice Lake upside down,

12
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:13,040
we must find them.

13
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,410
Understood.

14
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:42,200
Jing!

15
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,240
Jing!

16
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:47,520
Jing.

17
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,120
-Lingyun.
-Jing.

18
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,220
How are you?

19
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:51,800
Did you have another nightmare?

20
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:53,150
Where do you feel unwell?

21
00:02:53,150 --> 00:02:55,150
Should I call Master Xuan Zhen over?

22
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,160
Dad,

23
00:02:56,690 --> 00:02:57,920
please don't stop me.

24
00:02:58,320 --> 00:02:59,780
Jing was trying to save me.

25
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,080
I must save her.

26
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,840
-Lingyun!
-Save Jing!

27
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,680
-Lingyun, listen to me.
-I want to save Jing!

28
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,210
Lingyun!

29
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:05,740
-I must save Jing!
-You are still injured.

30
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:06,320
Lingyun!

31
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:07,320
-Lingyun!
-I want to save her!

32
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:08,840
No, Lingyun.

33
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:10,480
I want to save Jing!

34
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,080
Calm down.

35
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:13,120
You can't be in danger.

36
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,160
-You can't be in danger, Lingyun.
-Jing!

37
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:16,200
Jing!

38
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,360
Master Xuan Zhen.

39
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,720
Quick, go get Master Xuan Zhen!

40
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:22,280
-I want to save Jing.
-Go!

41
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,640
Hurry, go get Master Xuan Zhen!

42
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,079
I must go save Jing.

43
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,660
-Save Jing.
-Lingyun.

44
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:29,320
Jing.

45
00:03:44,780 --> 00:03:45,579
Young Master.

46
00:03:45,880 --> 00:03:46,740
How's it going?

47
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:48,000
Nothing.

48
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:52,690
Keep searching.

49
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:06,900
Young Master, over there!

50
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:12,090
Let's go check it out.

51
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:34,050
It's the Young Sect Leader!

52
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,000
Let's go.

53
00:04:54,440 --> 00:04:55,240
Young Master.

54
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:57,770
Hold him steady.

55
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:03,840
Haven't you found Jing and Senior Lu yet?

56
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:04,480
No.

57
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:09,720
The Young Sect Leader is unconscious now,

58
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,320
and we have no one else to ask.

59
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,560
Young Master Murong,

60
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,560
the Young Sect Leader was with

61
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,880
Young Master Jing and Senior Lu.

62
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,880
Since the Young Sect Leader is here,

63
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:20,160
why haven't we seen the other two?

64
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:23,530
Here's the plan:

65
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,240
We'll take care of the Young Sect Leader first

66
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:26,440
and discuss things further

67
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:27,370
once he wakes up.

68
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:28,200
Got it.

69
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:39,760
Junior,

70
00:05:40,640 --> 00:05:42,600
how is Mo Xiao's injury?

71
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,530
His most serious injury

72
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,440
is to his chest,

73
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:48,340
but it's not a sword wound.

74
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:50,600
It looks like he was hurt by a soft chain,

75
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:52,840
with the tip of a sword as its arrowhead.

76
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,620
The Phoenix Feather Chain of Feng Lixue.

77
00:05:58,720 --> 00:05:59,360
Senior,

78
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,440
don't you think

79
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,840
it's strange?

80
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
What's strange?

81
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:05,720
Don't you

82
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,090
understand your disciple yet?

83
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,360
If it were only this external wound,

84
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:12,880
how could he remain unconscious for so long?

85
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:15,170
Are you saying

86
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:17,120
he has other internal injuries?

87
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:18,400
Just now,

88
00:06:18,760 --> 00:06:20,240
while I was treating him,

89
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:22,680
I discovered that his vital energy

90
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:24,080
is completely reversed.

91
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,320
As for the reason why,

92
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,400
we'll have to

93
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,920
wait until he wakes up to ask him.

94
00:06:32,600 --> 00:06:35,360
I'll go back and prepare some medicinal soup for him.

95
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,040
Alright.

96
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:57,130
It turns out the Sword Sovereign's prediction was correct.

97
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,600
She is indeed your destined calamity.

98
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:06,290
Sect Leader.

99
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:08,320
What is it?

100
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:12,100
Grand Master Qingxu from the Penglai Sect has arrived.

101
00:07:23,750 --> 00:07:24,910
(Luntian Pavilion)

102
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:26,240
Senior Qingxu.
(Luntian Pavilion)

103
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:27,440
(Luntian Pavilion)

104
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,360
Senior Qingxu,
(Luntian Pavilion)

105
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:28,440
(Luntian Pavilion)

106
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:29,600
what brings you
(Luntian Pavilion)

107
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:29,680
(Luntian Pavilion)

108
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,280
to the Luntian Branch today?
(Luntian Pavilion)

109
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,659
(Luntian Pavilion)

110
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:35,850
Branch Leader Yuan,

111
00:07:36,320 --> 00:07:38,400
you make it sound so simple.

112
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,220
Today, I've brought my disciple, Yue Yao, here

113
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:42,820
to request someone from you.

114
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:44,680
You want someone from me?

115
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:45,480
Who?

116
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,280
Mo Xiao.

117
00:07:50,930 --> 00:07:51,800
Mo Xiao?

118
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,000
Senior Qingxu,

119
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,360
what's going on?

120
00:07:57,840 --> 00:07:59,280
My disciple, Hao Tian,

121
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:02,020
was at the Divine Pool of Yuepu,

122
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:04,900
guarding Penglai Sect's Water Qilin.

123
00:08:05,540 --> 00:08:07,370
However, on Tongming Island,

124
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,720
your disciple, Mo Xiao,

125
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:11,180
refused to subdue the demoness, Feng Lixue.

126
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,600
He was then summoned by your other disciple, Lu Jianchuan,

127
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,150
with a letter.

128
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,330
Because of that,

129
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:18,930
he died on Tongming Island.

130
00:08:19,640 --> 00:08:20,460
Shouldn't I

131
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:23,010
be asking you for an explanation?

132
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:23,760
What?

133
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:27,120
There was a Penglai Sect disciple on Tongming Island?

134
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:27,230
That day,

135
00:08:27,230 --> 00:08:27,840
(Luntian Pavilion)
That day,

136
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:28,360
(Luntian Pavilion)

137
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:30,800
I came to Shushan Sect on behalf of my master to demand an explanation.
(Luntian Pavilion)

138
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,679
Your Luntian Branch claimed that your young sect leader
(Luntian Pavilion)

139
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,070
would put an end to the turmoil on Tongming Island.
(Luntian Pavilion)

140
00:08:34,070 --> 00:08:34,600
would put an end to the turmoil on Tongming Island.

141
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,360
But he neither killed Feng Lixue

142
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:38,360
nor stopped the chaos on the island.

143
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:40,840
Instead, he caused my senior's death on Tongming Island,

144
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:42,720
while both the young sect leader of Shushan and the young master of Tielyv Branch,

145
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:44,049
walked away unscathed.

146
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:45,280
Today,

147
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:48,250
I demand that you return Senior Hao Tian to me.

148
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:48,360
(Luntian Pavilion)
I demand that you return Senior Hao Tian to me.

149
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:52,800
(Luntian Pavilion)

150
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:53,930
Branch Leader Yuan,
(Luntian Pavilion)

151
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,440
Yue Yao is being harsh for a reason.

152
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:01,080
The two of them were engaged,

153
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:03,120
and Hao Tian's duty to guard the Water Qilin

154
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,480
had just over a month left.

155
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,400
Yue Yao was joyfully preparing for their wedding,

156
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,840
but unexpectedly...

157
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:16,880
Hao Tian was my most beloved disciple.

158
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:20,320
Yet, because of the reckless actions of Mo Xiao,

159
00:09:20,340 --> 00:09:21,960
he lost his life unjustly.

160
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:24,590
Today,

161
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,640
we, Penglai Sect, demand an explanation from your Luntian Branch.

162
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,760
Senior Qingxu,

163
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,330
even though Mo Xiao and Lingyun

164
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:35,800
have returned from Tongming Island,

165
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:39,340
they are severely injured.

166
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:42,360
Mo Xiao is still unconscious.

167
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,960
How about this?

168
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:47,120
Once Mo Xiao wakes up,

169
00:09:47,400 --> 00:09:48,880
we'll clarify the situation

170
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,880
and provide you with an explanation.

171
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:51,410
Alright.

172
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:53,080
In that case,

173
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,940
please summon all four branch leaders of the Shushan Sect.

174
00:09:57,520 --> 00:09:58,320
Today,

175
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,250
let's seek a fair and just resolution.

176
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:29,680
Senior Murong.

177
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:34,680
Tell me,

178
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,470
where are my sister and Senior Lu?

179
00:10:38,960 --> 00:10:39,920
Junior Jing.

180
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,000
Senior Lu.

181
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,520
Where are they?

182
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,210
Still playing dumb?

183
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:49,870
Weren't they with you?

184
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:51,480
Why did you survive?

185
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:53,960
Did you get them killed?

186
00:10:59,040 --> 00:10:59,640
Tell me!

187
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:06,030
I remember now.

188
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,530
Tianxing Secret Treasury.

189
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:11,120
Something's not right about the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

190
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,920
I have to tell Master right away.

191
00:11:14,890 --> 00:11:16,220
I'm asking you now.

192
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,530
Where are my sister and the others?

193
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,440
Are they really dead?

194
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:25,810
I don't know.

195
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,120
This is all your fault!

196
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,000
You're the one who got my sister and the others killed!

197
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:35,840
Why?

198
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,210
Why?

199
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:40,160
You had the Sect Leader's order,

200
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,220
so why didn't you kill that demoness?

201
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,200
Why did you let her onto the island

202
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:46,260
and put Jing and the others in danger?

203
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,320
If hitting me will make you feel better,

204
00:11:54,540 --> 00:11:55,960
then go ahead.

205
00:11:57,480 --> 00:11:57,960
Stop!

206
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:07,090
Senior Murong.

207
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:10,560
Rest assured.

208
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:12,950
I'll get to the bottom of it

209
00:12:14,280 --> 00:12:15,480
and make sure the Shushan Sect,

210
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,880
and all of you, get the answers you deserve.

211
00:12:51,020 --> 00:12:51,720
Mo Xiao,

212
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,370
do you think Jing and the others

213
00:12:57,270 --> 00:12:58,470
could still be alive?

214
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:01,410
Whether they're alive or dead,

215
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:03,840
we have to find them.

216
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:07,560
That's why we made it out alive.

217
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:11,890
You also believe they're still alive, right?

218
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:14,280
But I could only watch as they were swallowed up,

219
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,760
powerless to stop it.

220
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,320
Right before I blacked out,

221
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:35,960
I vaguely saw a mysterious figure

222
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,040
taking Lixue away.

223
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,500
It seems that to find Jing and the others,

224
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,280
we'll need to find that person first.

225
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,680
What mysterious person?

226
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:50,090
Since he has already appeared,

227
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:50,960
I think

228
00:13:51,400 --> 00:13:52,680
he won't hide for long.

229
00:13:53,080 --> 00:13:53,860
So what do we need to do

230
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:55,660
to find this mysterious person?

231
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,760
My senior, Hao Tian,

232
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,220
lost his life on Tongming Island because of

233
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,620
Mo Xiao's incompetence.

234
00:14:03,800 --> 00:14:04,480
Today,

235
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:06,710
I demand Mo Xiao's life in exchange.

236
00:14:07,160 --> 00:14:09,120
Senior Qingxu, do you also believe

237
00:14:09,240 --> 00:14:10,700
that my disciple, Mo Xiao,

238
00:14:11,000 --> 00:14:13,060
should pay with his life for Hao Tian?

239
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:16,480
It's up to you, Sect Leader, to decide how to handle this.

240
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,960
Mo Xiao might have mishandled the situation

241
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:22,400
with the demoness on Tongming Island,

242
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,160
but in the end, he was just following my orders

243
00:14:25,160 --> 00:14:27,560
to deal with demons and eliminate threats.

244
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,880
Now that our disciples have been killed by the demoness,

245
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:34,290
shouldn't we be standing together against the real enemy?

246
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,840
Why are we turning on each other instead?

247
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:39,480
Branch Leader, are you suggesting that

248
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,680
the Penglai Sect

249
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:43,200
should go after that demoness

250
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:46,040
instead of holding the Shushan Sect accountable?

251
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,720
That day, when my disciple, Hao Tian,

252
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,320
went to Tongming Island to assist,

253
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,160
he had the chance to kill the demoness.

254
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:53,240
However, Mo Xiao intervened,

255
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,720
protecting her and obstructing him at every turn,

256
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:57,320
causing him to miss the opportunity

257
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,660
and leading to the situation we face today.

258
00:14:59,660 --> 00:15:02,350
Mo Xiao can't escape his guilt.

259
00:15:05,550 --> 00:15:06,750
Grand Master Qingxu.

260
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:08,000
Indeed,

261
00:15:08,520 --> 00:15:11,580
Mo Xiao's actions have led to a catastrophic disaster.

262
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,800
Shushan Sect will hold him accountable according to our rules.

263
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,040
We are not trying to avoid responsibility.

264
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:18,680
However, it must be noted that

265
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:20,080
the disciples of Shushan

266
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:22,380
have also suffered significant losses.

267
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:23,710
Moreover,

268
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:26,440
even Jing...

269
00:15:31,570 --> 00:15:32,700
Branch Leader Yuan,

270
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:34,540
as the leader of a sect

271
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:36,600
and of the righteous sects,

272
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,320
you should be the least biased and protective.

273
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,240
If not,

274
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:42,160
who knows how many more disciples

275
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,670
will end up suffering?

276
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:46,480
Shushan Sect has always been at the forefront of our three great immortal sects.

277
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,380
But I never expected its sect leader and young sect leader

278
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:49,840
to be so biased,

279
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,200
stubborn, and self-righteous.

280
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:52,400
If we, the disciples of the immortal sects,

281
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,320
are to follow such leaders in the future,

282
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:56,120
won't that be a joke to the world?

283
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:56,850
How dare you!

284
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,060
You insolent girl!

285
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:01,000
How can you speak so disrespectfully?

286
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:01,960
No matter what,

287
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:03,930
the Sect Leader is your senior.

288
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:06,080
How could you address him like that?

289
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,190
Even a junior

290
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,050
dares to question me, the Sect Leader of Shushan.

291
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:22,480
It seems that,

292
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,920
Senior Qingxu,

293
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,160
the justice you and your disciples seek today

294
00:16:28,280 --> 00:16:30,120
requires me, Yuan Beichen,

295
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:33,080
to step down voluntarily from my position as the Sect Leader of Shushan.

296
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:34,400
Only then will you be satisfied.

297
00:16:34,400 --> 00:16:35,240
Sect Leader,

298
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:36,120
you mustn't do that!

299
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,040
-Sect Leader, you can't do that.
-I, Mo Xiao,

300
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:39,840
am here to accept my punishment.

301
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,520
Master,

302
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:55,100
I, Mo Xiao, have disobeyed your orders,

303
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,240
causing great calamity.

304
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,920
I have come to accept the consequences.

305
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,680
I am willing to share the punishment with the Young Sect Leader.

306
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:00,630
But what kind of punishment

307
00:17:00,630 --> 00:17:02,240
could ever bring Senior Hao Tian back to life?

308
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:02,840
Enough!

309
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,400
You are a disciple of Penglai Sect,

310
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,319
and also part of the righteous immortal sects.

311
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,839
Instead of fighting demons and monsters,

312
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:10,420
you came to the Luntian Pavilion of Shushan Sect,

313
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,079
calling for violence and bloodshed.

314
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,339
Is this how you express

315
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:14,560
your fiery temper?

316
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:17,240
I believe your outburst earlier was due to the grief

317
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:18,569
of losing your partner,

318
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:20,960
which caused you to speak out of turn.

319
00:17:20,960 --> 00:17:22,720
That's why I overlooked it this time.

320
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,800
But if you continue

321
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,970
disrespecting your elders and speaking recklessly...

322
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,000
Grand Master Qingxu,

323
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:31,000
if you don't take action,

324
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,800
I may have to teach your favored disciple

325
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,320
a lesson myself.

326
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,440
Did you hear

327
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:40,360
what my junior said?

328
00:17:41,640 --> 00:17:42,400
Yue Yao,

329
00:17:43,550 --> 00:17:44,560
you can leave now.

330
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:50,960
Master,

331
00:17:52,120 --> 00:17:53,480
I have failed to carry out your order effectively,

332
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:56,480
leading to the death of many of our Shushan Sect disciples on Tongming Island.

333
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,940
My sins are unforgivable.

334
00:17:58,480 --> 00:17:59,680
However, I humbly request that

335
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,280
before I face my punishment,

336
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:03,650
you, masters, grant me one more chance

337
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:05,400
to return to Tongming Island

338
00:18:05,480 --> 00:18:07,880
and uncover the forces behind this scheme,

339
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,200
so that our fellow disciples' souls can find peace

340
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,640
and their grievances can be avenged.

341
00:18:12,640 --> 00:18:14,300
Given the current situation,

342
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,440
it seems

343
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,360
I have no choice but to reveal

344
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:19,720
the truth behind the Tongming Island incident.

345
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,280
Master.

346
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,120
Mo Xiao's decision not to kill Feng Lixue

347
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,640
was made with my tacit approval.

348
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,160
Sect Leader,

349
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,520
have you lost your mind?

350
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,080
Years ago, before Feng Lixue

351
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,100
fell from the peak of Snow Peak,

352
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:41,470
she was struck by a mysterious demonic power.

353
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,720
In fact,

354
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:48,060
all four people who were on the peak of Snow Peak at that time

355
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:50,170
were injured by the demonic power.

356
00:18:51,280 --> 00:18:54,640
Sword Sovereign transferred his lifelong cultivation to Mo Xiao,

357
00:18:54,640 --> 00:18:56,920
which was the only reason Mo Xiao survived.

358
00:18:56,920 --> 00:18:59,760
But Feng Lixue managed to come back from the dead.

359
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:01,890
It's highly likely that

360
00:19:02,120 --> 00:19:05,480
the mysterious demonic power is involved.

361
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:08,640
To uncover the person behind Feng Lixue,

362
00:19:08,840 --> 00:19:10,700
I issued the Sect Leader's Order,

363
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,720
commanding Mo Xiao to kill Feng Lixue

364
00:19:15,080 --> 00:19:19,680
and put an end to the martial arts world's desire for the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

365
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,720
But secretly, I gave Mo Xiao another order,

366
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:28,220
instructing him to investigate the person behind Feng Lixue.

367
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:30,430
What kind of power is strong enough

368
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:33,660
that even Sword Sovereign has to risk his lifelong cultivation

369
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,960
to protect Mo Xiao's life?

370
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,450
Could this all be connected

371
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,120
to the Millennium Token?

372
00:19:44,320 --> 00:19:46,080
The immortal sects

373
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:49,280
may soon face a great calamity.

374
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:02,840
Mo Xiao,

375
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:05,720
are you really going?

376
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:10,640
If you fail again,

377
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:14,900
don't even think about coming back to see me at Shushan.

378
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:19,580
Are you willing to swear an oath in public?

379
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:23,800
I

380
00:20:25,750 --> 00:20:26,590
am.

381
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:30,560
I'm also willing to go

382
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,450
and make up for my mistakes.

383
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:47,960
Dad,

384
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:50,680
are you finished?

385
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,220
It's not like I've never been down the mountain before.

386
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,200
I'm fine.

387
00:20:57,580 --> 00:20:58,380
Oh, by the way,

388
00:20:58,890 --> 00:21:02,150
this is the New Year's gift your uncle gives you every year.

389
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
I've already kept half of it for you.

390
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:07,120
That's so unreasonable, Dad.

391
00:21:07,220 --> 00:21:08,290
The money my uncle gave me...

392
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,520
You little brat, what are you even saying?

393
00:21:10,520 --> 00:21:11,000
Dad,

394
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:11,760
your back's not in good shape.

395
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:13,110
Be careful.

396
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,880
You've been without a mother since you were young,

397
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:23,890
and your uncle spoils you too much.

398
00:21:23,960 --> 00:21:25,200
That's probably why you've turned out the way you have,

399
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,400
so wild and reckless.

400
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,010
If I don't keep an eye on you,

401
00:21:28,080 --> 00:21:29,340
who knows what kind of trouble you'll get into...

402
00:21:29,340 --> 00:21:30,160
Alright, Dad.

403
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,240
I understand now.

404
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:32,790
It was my fault before.

405
00:21:32,920 --> 00:21:34,120
I wasn't dependable.

406
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,600
I'm glad you understand.

407
00:21:37,920 --> 00:21:40,320
So this time, when you go down the mountain,

408
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:41,920
be extra careful.

409
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:47,280
And don't you ever

410
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:51,040
scare me like that again.

411
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:53,840
Master Xuan Zhen.

412
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,920
Well, you little rascal.

413
00:22:02,160 --> 00:22:03,120
How dare you trick...

414
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,010
Hey, Xie.

415
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,690
Now that's more like my dad.

416
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,930
Just you wait.

417
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:10,240
Don't you dare leave.

418
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,980
In this vast sea of people,

419
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:21,120
where are we supposed to search?

420
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:23,950
Your Dandelion Floren might be powerful,

421
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,840
but its information feelers are limited to the mortal realm.

422
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:29,840
If that mysterious figure is a demon or a supernatural being,

423
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,500
it won't be able to reach them.

424
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,960
That's why Floren needs additional support.

425
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:34,560
Support?

426
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,120
What kind of support?

427
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:39,960
Murong Ce.

428
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:41,720
Are you here to help us?

429
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,090
I'm not here to help you.

430
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:44,730
I'm going to find my sister.

431
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,120
Who cares?

432
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,440
We're heading the same way, after all.

433
00:22:49,440 --> 00:22:50,040
Right?

434
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:52,100
Just keep your hands to yourself.

435
00:22:58,800 --> 00:22:59,880
This guy's

436
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,360
even more delicate than his sister.

437
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:32,680
Jing!

438
00:23:39,920 --> 00:23:42,760
Could this be where Tongming Island sank beneath the water?

439
00:23:42,760 --> 00:23:44,360
Let's go down and take a look.

440
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:19,680
Why have so many people been brought here

441
00:24:19,680 --> 00:24:20,720
recently to offer their spirits?

442
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,280
To help the Supreme Lord nourish the spirit stones,

443
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,000
the more people, the better.

444
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,760
Alright,

445
00:24:24,780 --> 00:24:25,810
let's hurry and fetch some water.

446
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,340
Let's go.

447
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:30,420
Offering spirits?

448
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,680
What is that?

449
00:24:38,420 --> 00:24:41,350
(Love and Desire Valley)

450
00:24:45,380 --> 00:24:46,710
Love and Desire Valley.

451
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:49,080
How come I've never heard of this place?

452
00:24:50,550 --> 00:24:52,150
The Wind Chime is vibrating.

453
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:55,060
The spirit essence is coming from that direction.

454
00:24:59,590 --> 00:25:01,050
Let's go in and take a look.

455
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:54,600
Don't kill him...

456
00:25:59,930 --> 00:26:01,700
I'll kill him!

457
00:26:28,710 --> 00:26:31,690
♫A pale moon through the screen, your face so bright♫

458
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,890
♫Mist and clouds gather, I long for just one glance♫

459
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:41,210
♫Some find closure, some regret, for a thousand years♫

460
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:45,340
♫The bell and homing swallows stir my heartstrings♫

461
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,870
♫Fingers linger on those words once more♫

462
00:26:48,890 --> 00:26:55,020
♫I know the lines, not the tone, leave it to fate♫

463
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:59,260
♫Parted, reunited, replayed in the wind♫

464
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:02,560
♫Vanished, reappeared, rising in dreams♫

465
00:27:02,710 --> 00:27:10,410
♫A sword in the eyes, a thread in the heart, unbroken♫

466
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:16,680
♫Though the wind carries, with no return, drifting, echoes tense♫

467
00:27:16,710 --> 00:27:19,360
♫Falling flowers rise, flowing water feels no weight♫

468
00:27:19,620 --> 00:27:25,840
♫Gather a lifetime of blossoms, like dreams, like you♫

469
00:27:26,030 --> 00:27:30,430
♫Though just a moment, countless thoughts, unspoken, joy and grief entwined♫

470
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:33,420
♫Wipe away tears, never part, never leave♫

471
00:27:33,450 --> 00:27:43,940
♫Drenched in a lifetime of rain, waiting for the perfect line, and for you, for you♫

472
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,120
Who am I...

473
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,540
at this moment?

474
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:14,600
You are

475
00:28:16,680 --> 00:28:17,880
Feng Lixue.

476
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,070
I'll kill them!

477
00:28:22,280 --> 00:28:23,370
Today,

478
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:26,760
I will seal away a strand of your vengeful consciousness.

479
00:28:26,870 --> 00:28:28,700
When the time is right,

480
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:30,430
I'll release it

481
00:28:30,450 --> 00:28:32,650
to help you exact your revenge.

482
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:34,800
It was you.

483
00:28:35,330 --> 00:28:37,930
You sealed away a fragment of my consciousness

484
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,240
and performed the spirit-splitting technique on me.

485
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:45,240
One side is Wu Chen, who has forgotten everything,

486
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:48,160
and the other is the vengeful Phoenix-masked Woman.

487
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:48,980
No.

488
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,930
This was your choice all along.

489
00:28:54,040 --> 00:28:56,220
I simply gave you the chance.

490
00:28:57,160 --> 00:28:58,620
It was also to protect you.

491
00:28:59,890 --> 00:29:00,760
Otherwise,

492
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:02,430
you would have long ago

493
00:29:02,520 --> 00:29:05,180
been killed by your own obsession with revenge.

494
00:29:05,490 --> 00:29:06,540
Just like

495
00:29:07,260 --> 00:29:09,740
Snowy, who perished on Tongming Island.

496
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:12,040
Why?

497
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:15,290
Why did you give me the memories of two people,

498
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,840
forcing me to live with dual consciousness?

499
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,440
Because this was the only way

500
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,940
you could be reborn

501
00:29:22,880 --> 00:29:25,160
and bide your time for revenge.

502
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,120
Now,

503
00:29:28,240 --> 00:29:30,570
I've given you both the chance for rebirth

504
00:29:31,360 --> 00:29:34,000
and the opportunity for vengeance.

505
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,140
What?

506
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:38,520
You've avenged your father,

507
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:40,640
and now you're questioning me?

508
00:29:48,480 --> 00:29:49,360
Remember,

509
00:29:50,080 --> 00:29:51,400
from now on,

510
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,320
you are no longer Wu Chen,

511
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:56,850
nor are you the Phoenix-masked Woman.

512
00:29:57,150 --> 00:29:57,940
You

513
00:29:58,600 --> 00:29:59,520
are just you,

514
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:01,760
Feng Lixue.

515
00:30:03,400 --> 00:30:05,320
You are my disciple.

516
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:07,440
You are mine.

517
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,280
I've arranged

518
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:18,860
everything for you

519
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:21,240
from here on.

520
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:23,600
See

521
00:30:24,880 --> 00:30:25,880
who I've

522
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:28,120
brought back for you.

523
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,640
My Lady.

524
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:31,440
Po Yun.

525
00:30:32,760 --> 00:30:34,110
From now on,

526
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:37,200
I will give you a brand new start.

527
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:40,830
I will make you even more powerful.

528
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,460
Haven't you always wanted to know

529
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:45,440
who I am?

530
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,560
For the past 10 years,

531
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,240
you never let me ask.

532
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,770
That's because the time wasn't right.

533
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,250
Now.

534
00:30:56,830 --> 00:30:57,790
It's time.

535
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:19,800
I heard that Star Lord Ji has come out of the Demon Prison

536
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:21,660
and been hiding in the Dark Soul Palace ever since,

537
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:22,990
refusing to see anyone.

538
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,660
The Supreme Lord has arrived.

539
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:33,280
Greetings, Supreme Lord.

540
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,260
Who is this young lady?

541
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:39,960
Star Lord Xuyan, you've been living in Yaoling Palace for so long

542
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,200
that you no longer concern yourself with worldly matters.

543
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,640
She is someone of great importance to our Heavenly Demon Clan,

544
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:46,700
and yet you don't even recognize her?

545
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,400
Please enlighten me, Supreme Lord.

546
00:31:52,300 --> 00:31:53,030
Fine.

547
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:56,610
Then I'll formally introduce her today.

548
00:31:57,410 --> 00:31:58,600
This young lady

549
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,860
is the one who assisted me in

550
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:05,370
retrieving the Stone of Insatiability from Tongming Island

551
00:32:05,370 --> 00:32:08,050
and defeating the Shushan Immortal Sect,

552
00:32:08,460 --> 00:32:09,700
Feng Lixue.

553
00:32:12,390 --> 00:32:13,730
She is also the disciple I took in 10 years ago.

554
00:32:13,730 --> 00:32:15,410
From now on,

555
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:19,360
she will hold the title of

556
00:32:19,650 --> 00:32:21,850
Star Lord of Shaohao

557
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,430
in the Heavenly Demon Sect.

558
00:32:29,830 --> 00:32:33,690
Supreme Lord, do you intend to appoint her as the Star Lord of Shaohao?

559
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:36,280
What?

560
00:32:37,000 --> 00:32:38,880
Was I not clear enough earlier?

561
00:32:46,240 --> 00:32:48,680
Miss, are you a member of the Heavenly Demon Clan?

562
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:49,680
I might be,

563
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:51,200
or I might not.

564
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:55,380
What do you mean by that, Miss?

565
00:32:56,910 --> 00:32:58,250
If Master says I am,

566
00:32:58,440 --> 00:32:59,280
then I am.

567
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:01,590
If Master says I'm not,

568
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:02,920
then I'm not.

569
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:06,000
All the Star Lords of our Heavenly Demon Clan's palaces

570
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:07,840
are either full members of the Heavenly Demon Clan

571
00:33:07,840 --> 00:33:09,570
or at least affiliated with us.

572
00:33:10,720 --> 00:33:13,440
Never before has an outsider been appointed as a Star Lord.

573
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,240
Supreme Lord, are you making an exception for her?

574
00:33:18,520 --> 00:33:21,580
The position of Supreme Lord of the Heavenly Demon Clan

575
00:33:22,280 --> 00:33:24,080
can be held by me, an outsider,

576
00:33:25,250 --> 00:33:27,590
but a mere Star Lord of Shaohao Palace

577
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:30,880
is somehow beyond her reach?

578
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,120
Miss Lixue has successfully

579
00:33:34,400 --> 00:33:37,480
retrieved the Stone of Insatiability for the Heavenly Demon Sect,

580
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,280
accomplishing a remarkable feat.

581
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:40,970
She is truly deserving of the title

582
00:33:40,970 --> 00:33:42,200
of Shaohua Star Lord.

583
00:33:43,120 --> 00:33:44,070
However,

584
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,120
regarding the battle at Tongming Island,

585
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,960
Shushan Sect will surely not let it go.

586
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:51,600
Our Heavenly Demon Sect,

587
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,880
since the passing of Demon Lord Yeyuan,

588
00:33:53,930 --> 00:33:56,430
has never conflicted with the righteous immortal sects,

589
00:33:56,430 --> 00:33:59,760
secluding ourselves on Mount Suyu for self-preservation.

590
00:34:00,400 --> 00:34:01,200
But now,

591
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:03,020
to openly appoint someone

592
00:34:03,020 --> 00:34:05,880
who killed disciples of the righteous Shushan Sect

593
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,480
as a Star Lord of the Heavenly Demon Sect,

594
00:34:10,150 --> 00:34:12,120
I fear it might bring unexpected calamity

595
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,650
to our Heavenly Demon Sect.

596
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,850
Are you also a Star Lord?

597
00:34:18,440 --> 00:34:21,480
I am a Guardian of the Heavenly Demon Sect.

598
00:34:21,600 --> 00:34:23,060
With your timidity, fear,

599
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,400
hesitation, and overcaution,

600
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,260
what could you possibly protect?

601
00:34:35,510 --> 00:34:38,889
If all of you were like Star Lord Lixue,

602
00:34:40,860 --> 00:34:43,790
even if I had to shake the very foundations of the three realms,

603
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,000
I, Chongguang,

604
00:34:45,810 --> 00:34:46,929
could do it.

605
00:35:09,160 --> 00:35:10,120
Star Lord?

606
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,880
How dare you still address me as Star Lord?

607
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:15,210
You treacherous, glory-seeking coward!

608
00:35:15,650 --> 00:35:18,640
I was only locked away in the Demon Prison by Chongguang for a few days,

609
00:35:18,640 --> 00:35:21,400
and you immediately defected to the Formless Palace.

610
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:24,060
Had I known you were so disloyal and ungrateful,

611
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:27,240
I would have finished you off with a single lash of my whip.

612
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:28,700
Disloyal and ungrateful?

613
00:35:28,950 --> 00:35:30,640
What kind of affection did you ever show me?

614
00:35:30,640 --> 00:35:32,210
What loyalty did I owe to you?

615
00:35:32,210 --> 00:35:34,280
I've been by your side for so many years,

616
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,600
and you know better than anyone

617
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:37,480
the number of whip scars on my body.

618
00:35:37,480 --> 00:35:38,580
The only reason I'm still alive

619
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:40,020
is sheer luck.

620
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:41,420
Otherwise,

621
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:44,520
I would have died under your Dark Soul Whip long ago.

622
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:46,640
So you've hated me all along.

623
00:35:47,240 --> 00:35:48,570
I'm not afraid of death,

624
00:35:48,640 --> 00:35:50,840
but I hope my death would be worthwhile.

625
00:35:51,120 --> 00:35:53,450
You're capricious and ruthlessly cruel.

626
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:55,060
Under your Dark Soul Whip,

627
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:56,300
I was nothing more than a worthless life

628
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,480
for you to vent your emotions on at any time.

629
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,000
Day after day, living was worse than death to me.

630
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,480
But in the Formless Palace,

631
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:03,810
under the Supreme Lord,

632
00:36:04,040 --> 00:36:05,300
I found hope.

633
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:06,770
I received compassion.

634
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,740
Look carefully.

635
00:36:08,840 --> 00:36:11,360
I am now under the Supreme Lord's protection.

636
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,220
If your Dark Soul Whip

637
00:36:12,220 --> 00:36:13,700
dares to strike me again,

638
00:36:13,910 --> 00:36:16,320
it would be like challenging the Supreme Lord.

639
00:36:16,320 --> 00:36:17,160
Star Lord Ji,

640
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:20,040
you'd better think carefully about it.

641
00:36:24,720 --> 00:36:25,650
What a disgrace!

642
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:28,080
You dare betray me too?

643
00:36:29,030 --> 00:36:31,430
I'll make every single one of you regret it.

644
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,340
What?

645
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,920
Aren't you surprised at all?

646
00:37:02,890 --> 00:37:04,620
I don't need to know who you are.

647
00:37:05,380 --> 00:37:06,720
All I need to know is,

648
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:09,880
you are my master.

649
00:37:13,640 --> 00:37:16,410
You don't care about the position of

650
00:37:16,440 --> 00:37:19,500
Star Lord of Shaohao in the Heavenly Demon Sect either?

651
00:37:19,760 --> 00:37:21,090
You told me before that,

652
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:22,800
from now on,

653
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,560
I belong to you.

654
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,800
I will do anything

655
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:28,520
you ask of me.

656
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,130
Very good.

657
00:37:33,520 --> 00:37:35,120
The Heavenly Demon Sect

658
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,730
is insignificant to us, master and disciple.

659
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,170
Our true goal is to dominate

660
00:37:42,120 --> 00:37:43,340
the mortal world,

661
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,960
the celestial court,

662
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:46,360
and the three realms.

663
00:37:48,800 --> 00:37:49,400
Go ahead.

664
00:37:50,800 --> 00:37:52,200
Go to your Shaohao Palace

665
00:37:52,480 --> 00:37:53,680
and see if you like it.

666
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:55,390
Three days from now,

667
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:58,540
I will hold an inauguration ceremony for you.

668
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:01,320
From now on, I'll have to live on Mount Suyu?

669
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,720
As you wish.

670
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:07,540
Perhaps you would feel more at ease living in

671
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:10,720
the Love and Desire Valley at the foot of the mountain.

672
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,430
You're also welcome

673
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:14,440
to stay at Changhuan Palace anytime.

674
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:14,960
Got it.

675
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:16,810
I'm leaving now.

676
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:26,970
Supreme Lord,

677
00:38:27,600 --> 00:38:29,840
appointing Miss Lixue as the Star Lord of Shaohao,

678
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:32,240
I fear the other two Star Lords won't agree.

679
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:34,200
So what if they don't?

680
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,560
When have I ever needed their consent

681
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,640
for anything I choose to do?

682
00:38:41,410 --> 00:38:42,720
How's the situation at Love and Desire Valley?

683
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:44,810
Mo Xiao has indeed located Love and Desire Valley.

684
00:38:44,810 --> 00:38:46,740
They've already entered the city.

685
00:38:48,120 --> 00:38:50,760
They're moving faster than I expected.

686
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:53,920
Although they've entered the city,

687
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,450
they remain very cautious.

688
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:57,890
They're constantly scouting around.

689
00:38:59,320 --> 00:39:00,120
Very good.

690
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:02,180
In that case,

691
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:05,240
they'll be knocking on our door soon.

692
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,460
Greetings, Star Lord of Shaohao.

693
00:39:25,480 --> 00:39:26,080
My Lady.

694
00:39:30,560 --> 00:39:31,290
What is this?

695
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,120
This is the token of our Shaohao Palace

696
00:39:33,120 --> 00:39:34,640
for traveling through the demon realm.

697
00:39:34,640 --> 00:39:35,320
With it,

698
00:39:35,480 --> 00:39:36,960
you can pass through Mount Suyu

699
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:38,690
and the Love and Desire Valley.

700
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:40,280
As long as you're within demon-controlled territory,

701
00:39:40,280 --> 00:39:41,600
you'll be able to pass through without hindrance.

702
00:39:41,600 --> 00:39:43,000
Each Star Lord possesses one.

703
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:45,480
This one belongs to Star Lord of Shaohao.

704
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,680
Star Lord of Shaohao.

705
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:52,320
Po Yun,

706
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,960
do you like my new identity?

707
00:39:58,080 --> 00:40:00,000
No matter what your identity is, My Lady,

708
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:01,330
I, Po Yun, am determined

709
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,180
to follow you wherever you go.

710
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:06,760
It's just that...

711
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,560
it's just that the Demon Lord arranged it this way.

712
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:10,420
The Demon Lord.

713
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:14,400
Did you also not expect

714
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:17,730
that he would turn out to be the Demon Lord?

715
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:22,840
Po Yun,

716
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,880
how did you survive?

717
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,280
Weren't all the people on Tongming Island already dead?

718
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:29,010
Are there any other survivors?

719
00:40:29,720 --> 00:40:30,720
Are you asking

720
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,930
because you want to know about Mo Xiao?

721
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:38,120
No.

722
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:40,850
I already killed him myself

723
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,880
in the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

724
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,200
But deep down,

725
00:40:45,280 --> 00:40:47,520
you don't feel any sense of satisfaction

726
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,580
for avenging the Sect Leader, do you?

727
00:40:51,760 --> 00:40:52,240
No,

728
00:40:53,680 --> 00:40:55,140
I'm actually quite happy.

729
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,480
There's nothing more satisfying than

730
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,880
taking down the enemy with my own hands.
