00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:35,710
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,670
(Episode 35)

3
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,600
Junior,

4
00:01:43,130 --> 00:01:44,990
are you hiding something from me?

5
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,729
If you truly respect Senior,

6
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,000
then listen to him.

7
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,150
Don't do anything.

8
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:53,170
As for everything else,

9
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:55,039
time will reveal the truth.

10
00:02:05,830 --> 00:02:08,100
Mo Xiao!

11
00:02:09,080 --> 00:02:11,020
Mo Xiao, don't be reckless!

12
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,530
I need a ship.

13
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:19,600
I have to leave this place.

14
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,650
Mo Xiao,

15
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:22,240
you must think carefully.

16
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,440
If you leave now,

17
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:26,320
both the immortal and demon sects

18
00:02:26,320 --> 00:02:29,160
will be lying in wait, ready to pounce.

19
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:31,200
Also, think about it.

20
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:33,040
Why did Murong Changfeng

21
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:34,970
make such a spectacle,

22
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,160
like he wanted the whole world to know that

23
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,160
Yuan Beichen was thrown into Ghost Valley?

24
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:41,920
Wasn't it just to lure you out?

25
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,079
Ghost Valley.

26
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,260
No.

27
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,660
My master's body must not remain in Ghost Valley.

28
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:49,290
But if you return,

29
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:52,079
the immortal sects will swarm to surround you.

30
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,930
They won't let you go easily.

31
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,440
Even so, I have to go.

32
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,840
I won't leave my master's body in Ghost Valley.

33
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,770
Absolutely not.

34
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,370
Lil' Hammer,

35
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,800
are you actually letting him go?

36
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:03,760
Remember,

37
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:07,840
once you step out of Li Fishing Village,

38
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:09,720
no matter what happens,

39
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:14,280
you must never speak a word about us.

40
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,360
Lil' Hammer,

41
00:03:27,690 --> 00:03:28,890
you stubborn old man.

42
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,140
He's walking straight into death.

43
00:03:30,140 --> 00:03:31,440
How can you still say that?

44
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,600
You haven't even finished the medicinal wine I made for you,

45
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,400
and your spiritual power is still sealed.

46
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:38,160
With just your mortal body, you're going up against the Immortal Sect of Shushan?

47
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,680
That's suicide.

48
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,870
The odds are really not in your favor.

49
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,200
Old man,

50
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:46,060
you're really stubborn!

51
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,460
Have you heard?

52
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:15,090
The last two sect leaders of the Shushan Sect

53
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:17,350
were actually practicing demonic arts.

54
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:20,320
Thankfully, Murong Changfeng, the Fengyu Branch Leader,

55
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,250
stepped in at the crucial moment and turned the tide.

56
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,360
It's said that

57
00:05:25,640 --> 00:05:27,130
the genius sword immortal, Mo Xiao,

58
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,640
is actually the son of the Demon Lord,

59
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,860
but he was raised in the Shushan Sect.

60
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:30,170
(Tea)
but he was raised in the Shushan Sect.

61
00:05:30,170 --> 00:05:30,680
(Tea)

62
00:05:30,680 --> 00:05:32,880
Do you think he's righteous or evil?
(Tea)

63
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:35,340
He has demon blood running through his veins,

64
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:36,670
so of course, he's evil.

65
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,280
Have you heard?

66
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:38,920
What is it?

67
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:40,320
His demonic side surfaced,

68
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,960
and he lost all control.

69
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:46,760
During the battle at Shushan, many of his fellow disciples were slaughtered by him.

70
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:49,000
No wonder Murong Changfeng, the new sect leader,

71
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,600
expelled both of them from the immortal sects.

72
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,930
I've also heard that

73
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:58,030
Yuan Beichen took his own life to atone for his sins,

74
00:05:58,120 --> 00:06:00,680
but his body could only be buried in the Ghost Valley.

75
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,320
He couldn't even go to the Sea of Reincarnation,

76
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:06,520
let alone have a memorial tablet in the Sword Pavilion.

77
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:10,520
It's such a shame to see a great sword immortal

78
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:13,530
end up like this.

79
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,730
Our Luntian Branch used to be so glorious.

80
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,240
We were the highest-ranking disciples of the Shushan Sect,

81
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:24,970
able to ascend directly to the Luntian Pavilion.

82
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:27,110
But now look at us.

83
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,100
All of this happened because of Mo Xiao.

84
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:32,490
If he weren't the demon's son,

85
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:33,760
Luntian Branch wouldn't have

86
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:35,890
been sealed overnight because of him.

87
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:37,680
And Master wouldn't have died.

88
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:38,450
Exactly.

89
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:40,500
We were all ruined because of him.

90
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,340
Master cared for him so deeply,

91
00:06:42,600 --> 00:06:44,320
yet in the end, it was he who brought harm to Master.

92
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:44,880
Alright,

93
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,720
let's not dwell on this any longer.

94
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,850
What's done is done.

95
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,340
We should focus on burying Master first.

96
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:52,950
Mo Xiao,

97
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:29,230
for you and for the Shushan Sect,

98
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,060
I cannot take the risk.

99
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,640
Even if I go against the principles of the Shushan Sect

100
00:07:33,640 --> 00:07:34,960
and commit the sin of killing,

101
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,350
I, Yuan Beichen, will bear the consequences alone.

102
00:07:37,350 --> 00:07:40,280
Although I've tried countless times to protect you,

103
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:42,150
fate is inescapable.

104
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:44,230
Life is full of twists and turns.

105
00:07:44,360 --> 00:07:45,420
Mo Xiao,

106
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,690
remember what I've told you.

107
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:49,920
No matter where you are,

108
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,360
your heart must remain true to the Way.

109
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,360
Mo Xiao.

110
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,000
I want to see him alive,

111
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:19,140
or at least his corpse if he's dead.

112
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:21,200
Sect Leader,

113
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:21,880
bad news!

114
00:08:22,120 --> 00:08:23,400
Mo Xiao is carrying Yuan Beichen's body

115
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,860
and trying to break into the Luntian Branch.

116
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:27,960
Mo Xiao,

117
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,760
you are no longer a disciple of the Shushan Sect.

118
00:08:29,760 --> 00:08:31,480
How dare you trespass on Shushan?

119
00:08:31,480 --> 00:08:32,679
According to Shushan's rules,

120
00:08:32,679 --> 00:08:34,520
you should be executed on the spot.

121
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,320
Yuan Beichen took his own life to atone for his sins at Shushan.

122
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:39,320
His body cannot be laid to rest in the Sea of Reincarnation,

123
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:41,480
and his spirit tablet will never be enshrined in the Sword Pavilion.

124
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:43,880
The Ghost Valley is where traitors belong.

125
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,540
Say another word,

126
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,560
and I'll kill you all.

127
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:06,760
Mo Xiao,

128
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:09,210
barging in like this

129
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,240
will only make Luntian Branch an even bigger joke.

130
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,960
The Sect Leader of Shushan,

131
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,740
the Branch Leader of Luntian Branch,

132
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:20,640
his body left to rot in Ghost Valley.

133
00:09:21,960 --> 00:09:25,020
This is truly the biggest shame for the Luntian Branch.

134
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,040
So, you're still alive.

135
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,700
I, Mo Xiao, am guilty.

136
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,080
The fault lies entirely with me.

137
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,440
But why must you disgrace my master?

138
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,340
Deceiving the Immortal Sect of Shushan,

139
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:23,960
secretly adopting a demon's son,

140
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,730
and eventually succumbing to the Demon Sect.

141
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,940
Aren't these crimes

142
00:10:30,410 --> 00:10:32,450
enough for him to pay with his life?

143
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,840
Though I am a demon's son,

144
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,760
I've been taught by my master since childhood

145
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:41,520
to protect the immortal sects and safeguard all living beings.

146
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,720
What wrong have I done

147
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:46,100
to deserve my master being humiliated like this by you?

148
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,080
Mo Xiao,

149
00:10:52,520 --> 00:10:54,120
you were born a demon's son,

150
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:57,040
marked by sin from the start.

151
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:58,520
This

152
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,080
is your fate.

153
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,000
As for your master,

154
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,090
when he chose to

155
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,210
secretly adopt a demon's son without the immortal sects' knowledge,

156
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:09,880
he sealed this very outcome.

157
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,480
This

158
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:12,640
is also his fate.

159
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:17,480
What if today,

160
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,280
I insist on burying my master's remains

161
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,880
in the Sea of Reincarnation?

162
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:28,490
Mo Xiao,

163
00:11:30,760 --> 00:11:33,360
if you want to give your master a proper burial,

164
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:35,600
it's not impossible.

165
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:41,300
Just hand over the Sect Leader's Token.

166
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:46,070
So that's what this is about.

167
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:50,080
This is why you lured me out, isn't it?

168
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,600
Whether you hand it over today,

169
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,170
that's up to you.

170
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:08,200
Master!

171
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:09,820
Master.

172
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,480
Mo Xiao carried his master's body on his back

173
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,760
and returned to the Luntian Branch.

174
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:13,640
Mo Xiao?

175
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,920
Mo Xiao is still alive?

176
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,180
Lingyun,

177
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:22,870
Mo Xiao isn't dead.

178
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:23,960
He's still alive.

179
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:35,450
(Luntian Pavilion)

180
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,040
Looking at the Luntian Pavilion like this

181
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,440
is much more comforting.

182
00:12:48,550 --> 00:12:53,650
(Virtue Through the Ages)

183
00:12:56,210 --> 00:13:00,390
(Virtue Through the Ages)

184
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,030
Mo Xiao,

185
00:13:03,080 --> 00:13:04,680
as per our agreement,

186
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:08,840
I have allowed you to collect Yuan Beichen's remains at the Luntian Branch

187
00:13:08,840 --> 00:13:11,170
and send them to the Sea of Reincarnation.

188
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:12,360
After all,

189
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,520
he was my senior.

190
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:16,600
And for so many years,

191
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:18,600
you've called me Master Changfeng.

192
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
As your elder,

193
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:23,140
I wouldn't deceive you with empty words.

194
00:13:24,520 --> 00:13:25,440
Now,

195
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:28,160
it's time for you to show your sincerity

196
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,620
and fulfill your promise.

197
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:33,320
Hand over the Sect Leader's Token.

198
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,440
Murong Changfeng,

199
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,400
you've already succeeded as the Sect Leader of the Shushan Sect.

200
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:39,590
But why didn't my master

201
00:13:39,590 --> 00:13:41,990
give you the Sect Leader's Token back then?

202
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,610
What do you mean?

203
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:53,040
If my master didn't do it,

204
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,400
then I won't either.

205
00:13:59,640 --> 00:14:01,560
You demon's son!

206
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:03,640
How dare you deceive me!

207
00:14:04,640 --> 00:14:05,400
Guards!

208
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,840
Seize him!

209
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:43,680
No wonder Fengyu Branch couldn't detect your spiritual energy.

210
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:45,560
It turns out it's been sealed.

211
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,790
You're nothing but a mortal now.

212
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,640
And yet you still dare come to the Luntian Branch to negotiate with me?

213
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,990
Since I dared to come,

214
00:14:54,040 --> 00:14:56,130
I never intended to leave.

215
00:14:56,760 --> 00:14:58,950
Then die.

216
00:15:01,130 --> 00:15:04,290
(Luntian Pavilion)

217
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,690
Water Spiritual Pearl?

218
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,640
The Nüwa Clan.

219
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,680
So, you've been hiding for days without leaving a trace,

220
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,600
concealed within the Li River.

221
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,010
Then, you must face your end even more now.

222
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:11,560
This...

223
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:34,620
Star Lord,

224
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:37,280
you've been unwell for several days, and your body is still weak.

225
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,810
You should go get some rest.

226
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,220
As for Yunchao,

227
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,080
have there been any updates?

228
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:45,960
The Star Envoy has been down the mountain for a few days now.

229
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,760
We should expect good news soon.

230
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:51,170
However, Chongguang's grand wedding

231
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:53,640
hasn't managed to reveal his whereabouts.

232
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,440
Would he...

233
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:58,440
No, that's impossible.

234
00:16:58,440 --> 00:17:00,760
The Young Supreme Lord is blessed by heaven.

235
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:01,890
Please don't worry.

236
00:17:05,200 --> 00:17:05,800
Mother,

237
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:08,829
I'm back.

238
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,160
Do you have any news?

239
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,160
My brother isn't dead.

240
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,160
He's still alive.

241
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:13,880
He's not dead

242
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,470
but still alive?

243
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:19,109
Is he alright?

244
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,430
Where is he?

245
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:21,880
He went back to the Shushan Sect

246
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:23,079
to bury Yuan Beichen.

247
00:17:23,200 --> 00:17:24,560
Although surrounded by disciples,

248
00:17:24,560 --> 00:17:27,490
he was saved by the Water Dragon when he was in danger.

249
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:30,400
The Water Dragon?

250
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:34,840
Could he be hiding in the Li River?

251
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:37,760
How is that possible?

252
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,880
Why would they, of all people, be the ones to rescue him?

253
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:41,650
Mother,

254
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:43,580
there's also a letter for you.

255
00:17:43,680 --> 00:17:44,800
When I was returning,

256
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,560
a Beauties Needle suddenly shot towards me.

257
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,760
This letter was attached to the needle.

258
00:17:48,920 --> 00:17:49,920
Beauties Needle?

259
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:55,100
That's the magical weapon of the Baicao Branch Leader of Shushan.

260
00:17:56,060 --> 00:17:58,720
She sent a secret message requesting to meet me.

261
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:02,240
Supreme Lord.

262
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:03,200
Chang Ming,

263
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:07,490
release her from the Puppet Spell.

264
00:18:08,520 --> 00:18:10,040
I want Feng Lixue,

265
00:18:10,450 --> 00:18:11,490
not a puppet.

266
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:12,610
Supreme Lord,

267
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:15,320
has the Ice Blue Moth not merged yet?

268
00:18:15,650 --> 00:18:17,850
I want you to release her from the Puppet Spell.

269
00:18:17,850 --> 00:18:18,800
Didn't you hear me?

270
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:19,600
Supreme Lord,

271
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,720
you can't do that.

272
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,640
The Ice Blue Moth must merge now.

273
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,560
Only then can the Heavenly Demon Power

274
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:25,000
from the Three Sacred Stones within the Supreme Consort

275
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,550
be transferred to you.

276
00:18:26,680 --> 00:18:28,560
If we release the Puppet Spell before then,

277
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,320
and the Supreme Consort betrays you again,

278
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:31,000
the consequences would be unthinkable.

279
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:32,730
I don't care about "what-ifs."

280
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:37,760
What I want

281
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:40,180
is a conscious Feng Lixue.

282
00:18:40,880 --> 00:18:41,680
Supreme Lord,

283
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,600
Mo Xiao has appeared.

284
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,820
Are you here for the appointment, Madam?

285
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:00,400
This way, please.

286
00:19:32,130 --> 00:19:33,380
Star Lord Xuyuan,

287
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:34,500
you've arrived.

288
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:36,290
Branch Leader Xuan Zhen.

289
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:38,410
We come from two different paths, immortals and demons.

290
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,170
You summoned me privately.

291
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:41,590
Is there something of great importance?

292
00:19:41,590 --> 00:19:42,920
Someone requested that

293
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:46,050
I entrust these two items

294
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,240
to you.

295
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:55,410
However, after today's visit to the Demon Subduing Palace,

296
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:57,040
the outcome remains uncertain.

297
00:19:57,040 --> 00:19:58,140
There is one matter

298
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:00,480
I must now entrust to you.

299
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,200
Can you tell me

300
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,770
who entrusted these to you?

301
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,640
My senior, Yuan Beichen.

302
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:13,720
Why did Former Leader Yuan entrust such important items

303
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,680
to me?

304
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,200
Please enlighten me.

305
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:18,840
Because my senior

306
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:20,960
had already foreseen that

307
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:24,490
a great change would occur between Mo Xiao and the Shushan Sect.

308
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,920
These two items

309
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:28,130
must be delivered to Mo Xiao,

310
00:20:28,150 --> 00:20:29,800
and you, as his mother,

311
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:32,210
will always support and help him.

312
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:33,440
So...

313
00:20:35,030 --> 00:20:36,880
But I've just found him.

314
00:20:37,640 --> 00:20:38,140
He and I...

315
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:38,760
I know.

316
00:20:39,500 --> 00:20:41,760
You already know Mo Xiao's whereabouts.

317
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:43,940
My senior's last wishes

318
00:20:44,410 --> 00:20:46,020
and Mo Xiao's future path

319
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,400
are now in your hands.

320
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,530
Don't worry,

321
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:06,980
I will make sure to pass them on to him.

322
00:21:31,090 --> 00:21:31,930
Yunchao,

323
00:21:32,490 --> 00:21:34,190
is it alright if I go dressed like this?

324
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:35,550
Of course.

325
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,120
Mother, you are the Saintess of our Nüwa Clan.

326
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,680
Now that you can return to Li,

327
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:41,660
the Chief must be overjoyed.

328
00:21:43,190 --> 00:21:45,580
Will he still refuse to see me?

329
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:46,480
Mother,

330
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,830
you don't need to worry.

331
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:50,140
Since the Chief rescued my brother,

332
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,530
it means he has already

333
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,040
acknowledged him in his heart.

334
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,490
As for you, Mother, you've been away from the clan for decades.

335
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:57,760
The Chief must have been thinking of you constantly.

336
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:59,220
It's just that, due to the clan's rules,

337
00:21:59,220 --> 00:22:01,350
he couldn't openly associate with us.

338
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:05,760
Mother,

339
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:08,100
the Chief used his water-controlling technique

340
00:22:08,100 --> 00:22:09,840
to rescue my brother from the Shushan Sect.

341
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,300
He has now attracted widespread attention,

342
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:14,640
and I'm sure the Shushan Sect won't just let this slide.

343
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,840
We can't afford to hesitate any longer.

344
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:17,940
Alright.

345
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:19,880
Let's leave now.

346
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:21,520
Star Lord,

347
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:22,360
Star Envoy,

348
00:22:22,520 --> 00:22:24,450
please be careful on your journey.

349
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:25,840
Let's go.

350
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,200
Supreme Lord,

351
00:22:32,280 --> 00:22:33,980
Murong Changfeng has taken the disciples of the Shushan Sect

352
00:22:33,980 --> 00:22:35,240
to Li Fishing Village.

353
00:22:37,300 --> 00:22:40,070
Is there any movement from Yaoling Palace?

354
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,640
Star Lord Xuyuan has already set out.

355
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:45,190
Observe in secret.

356
00:22:46,250 --> 00:22:49,980
There's no need to intervene unless the situation becomes critical.

357
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:51,060
As long as Mo Xiao

358
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,280
is brought back by Xuyuan Wushuang,

359
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:54,900
everything will be fine.

360
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:55,960
Yes.

361
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:57,620
Supreme Lord,

362
00:22:58,010 --> 00:22:59,810
I have one more matter to report.

363
00:23:00,600 --> 00:23:01,320
Speak.

364
00:23:01,920 --> 00:23:03,050
The Supreme Consort

365
00:23:03,080 --> 00:23:04,210
is not on Mount Suyu.

366
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:09,020
Very well.

367
00:23:09,080 --> 00:23:10,370
He's awake!

368
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:11,760
This is great.

369
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:15,850
it's thanks to Lil' Hammer's Water Spiritual Pearl.

370
00:23:15,880 --> 00:23:17,200
Otherwise, your life

371
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:20,700
would have ended at the Shushan Sect, just like your Master's.

372
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:22,550
How did I come back?

373
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,450
Shouldn't I be at Shushan Sect?

374
00:23:25,650 --> 00:23:27,710
All the more reason for me to kill you!

375
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:34,880
Water Dragon.

376
00:23:36,390 --> 00:23:37,680
A Water Dragon saved me.

377
00:23:37,680 --> 00:23:39,240
What Water Dragon?

378
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:42,600
That was Lil' Hammer using his water-controlling technique.

379
00:23:42,600 --> 00:23:43,320
The Chief?

380
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:44,690
Of course it was him.

381
00:23:44,800 --> 00:23:47,000
Even with his hardened heart,

382
00:23:47,170 --> 00:23:49,470
he couldn't just let the Shushan Sect

383
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:51,320
kill his own grandson.

384
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,160
To save you,

385
00:23:53,190 --> 00:23:55,240
the Chief, who has remained in seclusion

386
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:56,600
for decades in the Li River

387
00:23:56,600 --> 00:23:58,660
and has kept a low profile all this time,

388
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:00,400
personally intervened to rescue you.

389
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:00,990
Tell me,

390
00:24:01,350 --> 00:24:03,210
doesn't that show some humanity?

391
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:04,520
Grandson?

392
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:06,500
Exactly.

393
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,730
Bad news!

394
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,320
What's wrong?

395
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:10,180
What happened?

396
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,560
Someone has broken into the fishing village.

397
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,840
Who would dare do such a thing?

398
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,480
It seems to be people from the Shushan Sect.

399
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:15,670
Does Lil' Hammer know about this?

400
00:24:15,670 --> 00:24:17,800
Someone has already gone to report it.

401
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,200
Tell me,

402
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,810
where is Mo Xiao hiding?

403
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,770
He refuses to speak.

404
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,560
Then you tell me.

405
00:24:46,800 --> 00:24:47,730
Did you see that?

406
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:50,920
Neither of them is willing to speak.

407
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:53,450
I thought maybe one of you

408
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,170
might be willing to tell me.

409
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,000
This Mo Xiao

410
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,410
is a renegade disciple of the Shushan Sect,

411
00:25:04,410 --> 00:25:05,940
a remnant of the Demon Sect.

412
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:09,170
If you choose to harbor him today,

413
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:11,160
you will be seen as accomplices of the Demon Sect.

414
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:12,490
Should the Shushan Sect

415
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:15,120
decide to wipe out this small fishing village,

416
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:16,400
we would be justified in the eyes of the three realms

417
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:18,860
when they hold us accountable in the future.

418
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:20,560
Do you really think

419
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:22,380
we're in this fishing village

420
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,380
because we're weak or incompetent?

421
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,260
Although we live in seclusion,

422
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,160
we understand the meaning of loyalty.

423
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:31,120
No need to wait for the Chief's orders.

424
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,960
They dare to intrude into our Li River waters

425
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,200
and harm our people.

426
00:25:34,360 --> 00:25:35,480
Drive them out!

427
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:03,400
I didn't want to wipe out

428
00:26:03,420 --> 00:26:04,540
your Nüwa Clan,

429
00:26:05,370 --> 00:26:08,280
but if you continue to harbor Mo Xiao,

430
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:10,680
don't blame the Shushan Sect

431
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:12,840
for eliminating evil and protecting the righteous path.

432
00:26:12,840 --> 00:26:15,240
We'll have no choice but to wipe you all out.

433
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:37,180
Water-controlling technique.

434
00:26:37,210 --> 00:26:38,480
Nüwa Clan.

435
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:41,260
Could this be the sacred land of the Nüwa Clan's descendants?

436
00:26:41,260 --> 00:26:42,630
So that Chief is...

437
00:26:43,170 --> 00:26:44,570
Never mind who he is.

438
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:45,800
They're here for you.

439
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,460
You'd better hide quickly.

440
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,120
Hurry!

441
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:17,460
Mo Xiao is here.

442
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,200
Mo Xiao,

443
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,830
you think you can hide here

444
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,660
and be safe forever?

445
00:27:43,360 --> 00:27:44,760
What exactly do you want?

446
00:27:45,590 --> 00:27:46,800
What do I want?

447
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,600
You owe me something.

448
00:27:50,570 --> 00:27:51,970
It's time to hand it over.

449
00:27:52,490 --> 00:27:53,610
What if I don't?

450
00:27:58,020 --> 00:27:59,390
Murong Changfeng.

451
00:27:59,610 --> 00:28:00,490
Let me go.

452
00:28:04,290 --> 00:28:06,090
I'll give you one more chance.

453
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,250
Think carefully before you speak.

454
00:28:09,330 --> 00:28:11,660
Otherwise, if I strike for the third time,

455
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,560
they'll be dead.

456
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,270
Murong Changfeng.

457
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,020
You were once an elder of the Shushan Sect.

458
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:18,680
How can you be so despicable?

459
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:19,760
Let me go.

460
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:20,960
I'll kill him!

461
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:22,320
I'll kill him!

462
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,760
Your spiritual power is sealed.

463
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:25,080
You stand no chance against him.

464
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,960
I want to kill him.

465
00:28:30,050 --> 00:28:30,980
Are you alright?

466
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,150
Chief,

467
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,240
a renegade from Shushan Sect has intruded this place.

468
00:28:43,240 --> 00:28:46,360
I'm here on behalf of Shushan to take him down.

469
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:48,890
Chief,

470
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,800
for decades,

471
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:53,440
you've guided your people along the Li River,

472
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:54,880
cultivating yourselves

473
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:56,640
and leading a peaceful life.

474
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,000
Why is it

475
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,640
that now, you cannot hold back

476
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,640
and have decided to get involved in this struggle between good and evil?

477
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:07,360
There are no traitors from the Shushan Sect here.

478
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:10,800
Our fishing village has always remained neutral, staying away from
the conflict of good versus evil.

479
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:13,200
This is known throughout the three realms.

480
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,550
Murong Changfeng,

481
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:18,520
you've led your disciples into the territory of the Li River,

482
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:21,060
breaking our clan's rules.

483
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,080
Today,

484
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:24,760
you and I must face each other in battle.

485
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,520
Xuyuan Lingyue,

486
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,880
years ago, your daughter

487
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,600
broke your clan's rule against marrying outsiders

488
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,620
and eloped with Yeyuan under the cover of night.

489
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,440
Fortunately,

490
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,440
you made the right decision then

491
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:44,860
and severed your father-daughter relationship with her.

492
00:29:45,050 --> 00:29:45,860
Today,

493
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,800
for the sake of a mere demon's son,

494
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,480
are you

495
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,320
going to break

496
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:53,800
the century-old rules of the Nüwa Clan?

497
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,620
Father-daughter relationship?

498
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,560
The Chief is...

499
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:02,480
Your maternal grandfather.

500
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,940
Otherwise, why would he risk his life

501
00:30:03,940 --> 00:30:05,740
to go to Shushan Sect to save you?

502
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:10,800
I've told you before,

503
00:30:10,800 --> 00:30:12,470
we don't have any demon's son here,

504
00:30:12,470 --> 00:30:14,470
only descendants of my Xuyuan clan.

505
00:30:15,600 --> 00:30:16,620
Mo Xiao,

506
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,900
go with Elder Wuxin and lead our people

507
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:21,760
to retreat behind the long dyke.

508
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,770
The Water Spiritual Pearl of our Nüwa Clan

509
00:30:26,200 --> 00:30:28,960
hasn't unleashed its full power in a long time.

510
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,040
But today,

511
00:30:31,400 --> 00:30:34,440
it shall shine once more.

512
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:36,880
Elder Wuxin,

513
00:30:38,010 --> 00:30:40,270
who once secluded himself in shame

514
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:43,430
after failing to protect the Saintess,

515
00:30:43,550 --> 00:30:47,610
now walks the world under the name of the Divine Healer, Shi Bujiu.

516
00:30:48,880 --> 00:30:49,480
Very well.

517
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:52,080
For the sake of Mo Xiao,

518
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,090
both of you have shown yourselves.

519
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,170
Murong Changfeng,

520
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:58,480
if you have a score to settle, come at me.

521
00:30:58,480 --> 00:31:00,840
But if you dare lay a hand on any member of the Nüwa Clan,

522
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:01,720
I swear,

523
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,000
even if my soul is scattered across the three realms,

524
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,160
I'll never let you off!

525
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:05,950
Wuxin,

526
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,060
take him and go now.

527
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:07,980
Lil' Hammer,

528
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,040
so you've been arranging the construction of the new village all along.

529
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:12,870
You knew this day would come.

530
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,010
Alright,

531
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,650
I'll leave it to you.

532
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:16,970
Mo Xiao, let's go.

533
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:17,400
No.

534
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:17,640
Go.

535
00:31:17,660 --> 00:31:18,460
I can't leave.

536
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:18,840
Go.

537
00:31:18,860 --> 00:31:20,320
-I can't leave.
-Let's go.

538
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:22,400
Hurry!

539
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,200
Go!

540
00:31:36,620 --> 00:31:38,170
-Go! Hurry!
-Let's go.

541
00:31:38,200 --> 00:31:39,400
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

542
00:31:39,770 --> 00:31:40,970
-Let's go.
-Hurry!

543
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:53,440
Hurry up!

544
00:31:53,470 --> 00:31:54,480
Quick, hurry!

545
00:31:54,900 --> 00:31:56,300
-Follow them.
-Hurry up!

546
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,800
Quick! Go! Hurry!

547
00:31:58,750 --> 00:32:00,030
Hurry up!

548
00:32:00,950 --> 00:32:02,020
Go, quickly!

549
00:32:02,050 --> 00:32:02,590
Quick!

550
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:01,690
I had no intention of wiping out your entire Nüwa Clan.

551
00:33:01,960 --> 00:33:04,940
But now you're willing to risk your legacy

552
00:33:05,240 --> 00:33:07,570
just to protect that demon's son, Mo Xiao?

553
00:33:07,770 --> 00:33:08,530
What?

554
00:33:09,240 --> 00:33:10,920
Are you really forcing the Shushan Sect,

555
00:33:10,920 --> 00:33:12,810
to carry out a massacre here?

556
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:14,660
He is of my Xuyuan bloodline

557
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,310
and a descendant of the Nüwa Clan.

558
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:19,360
As the Chief,

559
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,100
I will protect my clan members

560
00:33:21,200 --> 00:33:23,330
even if it costs me my life.

561
00:33:24,280 --> 00:33:25,520
Fine.

562
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:27,760
Then you can die.

563
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:27,350
Murong Changfeng,

564
00:34:27,690 --> 00:34:29,290
we Nüwa are born of divine blood.

565
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,489
We live in seclusion,

566
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:31,040
but you

567
00:34:31,060 --> 00:34:33,320
dare trespass into our Li River and harm my people?

568
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:34,310
Today,

569
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,590
I, Xuyuan Wushuang,

570
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:36,980
will see to it that you disciples of Shushan

571
00:34:36,980 --> 00:34:38,840
are buried beneath these waters!

572
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:53,739
So, Mo Xiao,

573
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:57,440
you've truly chosen the path of darkness.

574
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,110
Let's see how far it takes you.

575
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,700
Father.

576
00:35:12,140 --> 00:35:12,970
Father.

577
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,000
It's alright.

578
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:55,090
Everything's alright now.

579
00:35:55,720 --> 00:35:57,360
He's only suffered some damage to his spiritual breath.

580
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,820
With a few days of rest, he'll recover fully.

581
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,030
Let's go.

582
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:01,320
Daughter.

583
00:37:03,500 --> 00:37:04,120
Father.

584
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:14,030
Even now,

585
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,200
you still don't understand, do you?

586
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,540
Back then, your defiance

587
00:37:21,720 --> 00:37:23,490
didn't just sever the bond

588
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:26,220
between us.

589
00:37:26,790 --> 00:37:29,190
It wounded the hearts of our people as well.

590
00:37:30,150 --> 00:37:33,220
You gave up your role as the Saintess of the Nüwa Clan,

591
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,200
and with it,

592
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:38,540
turned away from your duty and responsibility.

593
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:41,400
All for your own desires,

594
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:43,520
you abandoned the clan,

595
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,670
and by marrying into

596
00:37:46,880 --> 00:37:48,990
the demon sect,

597
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:50,900
you brought disgrace upon us.

598
00:37:52,660 --> 00:37:54,960
You didn't just disappoint me.

599
00:37:56,080 --> 00:37:58,750
You let down the entire Nüwa Clan.

600
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,820
I know I was wrong, Father.

601
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:04,570
I will repent before

602
00:38:05,040 --> 00:38:06,440
the Mother Goddess Nüwa.

603
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,160
Enough.

604
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,000
If you still care, even a little,

605
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,870
about the future of the Nüwa Clan,

606
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,910
then remember the vow

607
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,360
you once made.

608
00:38:23,080 --> 00:38:24,970
You are no longer one of us.

609
00:38:25,040 --> 00:38:27,280
Don't drag the conflict between the righteous and the demonic

610
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,040
back into Li.

611
00:38:31,200 --> 00:38:32,840
This is the only way

612
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:35,560
to keep our people safe.

613
00:38:36,360 --> 00:38:37,180
Father,

614
00:38:37,760 --> 00:38:38,760
was it because...

615
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:46,600
Fate plays cruel tricks.

616
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,160
Mo Xiao, by some twist of fate,

617
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,480
has ended up on the banks of the Li River.

618
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:56,660
He is your son.

619
00:38:57,400 --> 00:39:00,400
He also carries the bloodline of our Xuyuan clan.

620
00:39:00,830 --> 00:39:03,150
I couldn't stand by and watch him die,

621
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:09,690
but as you've seen,

622
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,150
my choice to save him

623
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:14,560
has drawn disaster upon the Nüwa Clan.

624
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,920
As the Chief,

625
00:39:17,370 --> 00:39:20,260
I can't allow personal sentiment

626
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:23,040
to place our people in jeopardy again.

627
00:39:29,340 --> 00:39:31,210
Take him and leave.

628
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,720
Never

629
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:43,350
ever come back again.

630
00:40:03,480 --> 00:40:04,080
Father,

631
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:09,800
I understand.

632
00:41:21,100 --> 00:41:22,320
My son,

633
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,080
I've finally found you.

634
00:41:37,580 --> 00:41:38,580
It's you.

635
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:47,330
Where's the Chief?

636
00:41:47,470 --> 00:41:48,280
Where are the villagers?

637
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:49,380
They're safe.

638
00:41:49,690 --> 00:41:51,580
Murong Changfeng has already withdrawn.

639
00:41:51,580 --> 00:41:52,960
The fishing village may have been destroyed,

640
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:55,240
but thankfully, the Chief had foreseen this.

641
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,740
He prepared a new settlement in the hills,

642
00:41:56,740 --> 00:41:57,650
moved the tribe there ahead of time,

643
00:41:57,650 --> 00:41:59,510
and safeguarded our foundation.

644
00:42:01,520 --> 00:42:02,520
It's all my fault.
