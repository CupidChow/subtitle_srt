00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,750
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,780 --> 00:01:38,759
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:46,060
There is no fire to boil the water.

4
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,580
We'll have to make do with some cold water for now.

5
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,830
You usually boil

6
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:52,820
your water before drinking it?

7
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,229
Yeah.

8
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:55,890
From now on,

9
00:01:55,979 --> 00:01:57,960
you should start getting used to drinking hot water too.

10
00:01:58,539 --> 00:02:00,190
Since I've decided to be with you,

11
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,640
naturally I should also learn your ways.

12
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:11,370
Is it because of the strange cold condition you have

13
00:02:11,390 --> 00:02:13,330
that you live alone in the snow plains of Mang Mountain?

14
00:02:15,080 --> 00:02:16,650
Yes and no.

15
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:18,950
My master had me live in the snow plains

16
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:21,840
so that my condition

17
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,900
would harm me less.

18
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:25,240
Besides,

19
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:28,110
I can't control the cold energy within my body.

20
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,680
If I lived with others,

21
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,440
I'd end up hurting them.

22
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,600
However...

23
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:36,050
you're different.

24
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,300
You're not afraid of my cold condition,

25
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:43,510
and when my cold energy erupts,

26
00:02:43,670 --> 00:02:44,870
you can even help to dispel it from me.

27
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:46,280
Therefore,

28
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:48,540
I can live with you.

29
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,510
I've only...

30
00:02:52,550 --> 00:02:55,060
temporarily stabilized your heart meridian with my inner energy.

31
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:56,610
I didn't cure you completely.

32
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:57,740
I think

33
00:02:57,770 --> 00:02:59,329
anyone with some cultivation

34
00:02:59,350 --> 00:03:00,450
could do that.

35
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:01,730
That's not right.

36
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:03,600
My master couldn't do it.

37
00:03:05,650 --> 00:03:08,050
Your cold condition forces you to live in seclusion.

38
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,050
This place has green mountains and clear waters

39
00:03:10,600 --> 00:03:11,620
and is peaceful and undisturbed.

40
00:03:11,890 --> 00:03:12,910
It's indeed a good place to live.

41
00:03:14,620 --> 00:03:15,630
I'll listen to you.

42
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:19,610
(Return to Shushan Sect quickly)

43
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:22,370
I should go back to attend my midday lessons now.

44
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:24,420
Can't you skip the midday lessons today?

45
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:26,110
No one should miss the six daily lessons at three different times.

46
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:27,260
That's Master's rule.

47
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:29,800
But your master isn't here.

48
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:31,000
What are you afraid of?

49
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:33,440
It's the same whether he's here or not.

50
00:03:34,660 --> 00:03:36,050
Such a goody-goody.

51
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,380
Such a goody-goody.

52
00:03:39,470 --> 00:03:40,440
So obedient.

53
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:44,870
Then let me ask you,

54
00:03:45,010 --> 00:03:46,829
if you broke the rules,

55
00:03:46,870 --> 00:03:48,550
would your master severely punish you?

56
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,400
If you won't be punished, what are you afraid of?

57
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,370
He wouldn't punish you, so what are you afraid of?

58
00:03:57,160 --> 00:03:58,120
It's not that there's no punishment.

59
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,800
It's that I've... never done anything wrong.

60
00:04:07,050 --> 00:04:08,890
(Goddess Temple)

61
00:04:08,890 --> 00:04:10,690
What is it about?
(Goddess Temple)

62
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:11,080
(Goddess Temple)

63
00:04:11,080 --> 00:04:11,800
It's so late.
(Goddess Temple)

64
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:11,830
(Goddess Temple)

65
00:04:11,830 --> 00:04:13,800
Can't it wait until tomorrow?
(Goddess Temple)

66
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,230
I want to teach you the Ice Sword Technique.

67
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:21,380
It can help suppress the cold energy in your body.

68
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,790
Start practicing from now on,

69
00:04:22,910 --> 00:04:24,330
and once you've mastered it,

70
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,290
you can go down the mountain and live peacefully among people.

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:27,670
Go down the mountain?

72
00:04:27,830 --> 00:04:29,740
But I never thought about leaving the mountain.

73
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,370
I think it's quite peaceful and nice here,

74
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:33,640
just like Mang Mountain.

75
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:57,320
You're teaching me swordsmanship

76
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:58,520
just so you can leave me, right?

77
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,790
You still won't take me with you, will you?

78
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:05,640
You and I are destined for different paths.

79
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:08,180
You will have to live on your own eventually.

80
00:05:09,270 --> 00:05:10,320
But I promise you,

81
00:05:10,430 --> 00:05:11,580
I will do everything in my power

82
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:12,750
to cure your cold condition.

83
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,240
I'm tired.

84
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:14,770
I'm done practicing.

85
00:06:06,910 --> 00:06:08,030
Do you know

86
00:06:08,050 --> 00:06:11,210
why your consciousness has drifted here?

87
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,560
For the past ten years, I have never neglected my cultivation, day or night.

88
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:16,420
My mind has never wandered.

89
00:06:16,450 --> 00:06:18,220
I don't know why I'm so absent-minded at this moment.

90
00:06:18,250 --> 00:06:21,090
There's an unresolved demonic obstacle in your heart.

91
00:06:21,270 --> 00:06:22,460
For the past decade,

92
00:06:22,550 --> 00:06:26,250
you've only been forcibly burying it deep within your consciousness.

93
00:06:26,390 --> 00:06:28,160
But the moment your guard is down,

94
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:30,580
it will seize the opportunity to resurface.

95
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:31,550
A demonic obstacle in my heart?

96
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:33,950
I've been cultivating with a clear mind,

97
00:06:33,990 --> 00:06:34,990
believing that my heart and spirit are unified.

98
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:36,790
I don't have distracting thoughts or demonic obstacles in my heart.

99
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:39,230
This is not something I can answer for you.

100
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:41,290
Ask your own heart.

101
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,400
Mo Xiao...

102
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,960
Even if I am reborn as a ghost,

103
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,970
-Lixue!
-I will come back...

104
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,890
to take revenge on you all!

105
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,470
Mo Xiao, you really did it.

106
00:06:59,760 --> 00:07:00,360
Don't be afraid.

107
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:01,040
Hold me tight.

108
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,240
I can protect you.

109
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:11,530
My Lord, nothing escapes your eyes.

110
00:07:11,550 --> 00:07:13,110
I indeed have a karmic burden

111
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:14,470
buried deep in my heart for 10 years.

112
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,150
Ten years ago...

113
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,890
because of a single careless moment, I caused Lixue's death,

114
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:21,520
making her... fall off a cliff.

115
00:07:21,860 --> 00:07:23,260
Since that day, her death has become

116
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,360
a karmic burden in my heart

117
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
that I cannot overcome.

118
00:07:26,750 --> 00:07:28,180
If I could live this life over again,

119
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:31,140
I swear I'd never let such a thing happen again.

120
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:33,810
If you don't face the tribulations in your fate,

121
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:35,900
you can't overcome your karmic obstacles.

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Everything is predetermined by fate.

123
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,550
You must walk your path wisely.

124
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,420
My Lord.

125
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,300
My Lord.

126
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:43,880
My Lord, please show me the way!

127
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,500
What are you doing?

128
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,460
Your lips are so warm.

129
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,410
What's wrong?

130
00:09:38,910 --> 00:09:40,160
Are you feeling hot?

131
00:09:40,430 --> 00:09:42,070
Your face is so red.

132
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,100
If you're overheated,

133
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,890
you can go over there and wash up.

134
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:47,090
The water there is cool.

135
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:52,440
Do you want to play in the water with me?

136
00:09:52,460 --> 00:09:53,170
Stop talking.

137
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,590
Hurry and put your clothes on.

138
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,430
Lixue?

139
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,490
Lixue?

140
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:12,230
Where did you get that phoenix-shaped mark

141
00:10:12,250 --> 00:10:13,010
on the back of your neck?

142
00:10:14,290 --> 00:10:15,900
You mean this?

143
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:17,280
This

144
00:10:17,300 --> 00:10:19,680
is a birthmark that I've had since I was born.

145
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:21,450
My father told me

146
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:24,110
that it's my unique mark in the world.

147
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,290
If you can't find me in the future,

148
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:28,890
you can find me through this.

149
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,010
What is this?

150
00:10:31,350 --> 00:10:32,600
This is my birthmark.

151
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:35,090
My father said it's unique in the world.

152
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,200
If I ever get lost,

153
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:38,370
you can find me by this mark.

154
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,000
Lixue...

155
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:52,010
You are Lixue, right?

156
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,950
Lixue?

157
00:10:55,310 --> 00:10:56,690
Who is Lixue?

158
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,620
(Goddess Temple)

159
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,000
Who are you really?

160
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:11,400
Are you really Lixue?

161
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,740
Then why don't you remember anything about the past?

162
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,710
Or...

163
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,560
is all this just a coincidence?

164
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:21,870
Master,

165
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,910
what do you need?

166
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:23,750
Floren,

167
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,610
have you found any information about the Snow Demon of Mang Mountain?

168
00:11:25,860 --> 00:11:28,310
It was the first time that Snow Demon showed itself and stirred up trouble,

169
00:11:28,440 --> 00:11:30,800
so I haven't found any information about its past yet.

170
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:32,780
Then...

171
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,560
what about Wu Chen, the orphan girl from Mang Mountain?

172
00:11:35,050 --> 00:11:36,230
Do you have any information about her?

173
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:37,680
I've traced things back to the time

174
00:11:37,700 --> 00:11:39,580
when I first started collecting intelligence for you, Master.

175
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,320
But all the information I could find showed

176
00:11:41,470 --> 00:11:42,510
that Miss Wu Chen

177
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:44,050
had indeed been living on Mang Mountain all along.

178
00:11:44,670 --> 00:11:46,590
Who exactly is the "Master" that Miss Wu Chen

179
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,010
speaks of?

180
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,350
I haven't yet detected any signs

181
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:50,830
of a second person on Mang Mountain.

182
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:54,150
Is it possible that Lixue didn't actually die?

183
00:11:56,570 --> 00:11:57,270
Master,

184
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,020
do you have any other instructions?

185
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,160
That's all.

186
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,860
Continue to investigate the real reason

187
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:03,400
why the Snow Demon of Mang Mountain suddenly appeared and wreaked havoc.

188
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:04,470
Yes, Master.

189
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:18,070
Wu Chen?

190
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:19,690
Why are you here?

191
00:12:20,790 --> 00:12:21,830
Where are you going?

192
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:23,610
I'm here to remind you

193
00:12:23,800 --> 00:12:26,160
that I haven't learned the sword technique you taught me yet,

194
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,900
so you can't sneak away.

195
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,280
Is that why

196
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,270
you've been guarding outside my room door?

197
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,500
It may be a dumb method,

198
00:12:34,870 --> 00:12:36,460
but I'm telling you now

199
00:12:36,590 --> 00:12:37,830
that if you sneak away,

200
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:39,350
I will chase after you,

201
00:12:39,630 --> 00:12:42,470
and then, what happened in Mang Mountain Village might happen again.

202
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:45,670
If my cold energy were to burst out,

203
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:46,750
it would be terrible.

204
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:52,840
Alright.

205
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:55,020
I'll take you with me tomorrow.

206
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,440
Let's go now?

207
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:57,550
We'll set out tomorrow.

208
00:12:58,470 --> 00:12:59,030
Back to the Shushan Sect.

209
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:19,920
Mo Xiao,

210
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:22,190
can this thing really fly?

211
00:13:22,290 --> 00:13:22,910
Get on.

212
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,540
I'll pass.

213
00:13:25,640 --> 00:13:27,690
I'm pretty fast on my feet.

214
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:31,450
Mo Xiao,

215
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:34,720
this thing used to carry only one person.

216
00:13:34,840 --> 00:13:36,240
Now it has to carry two.

217
00:13:36,260 --> 00:13:37,270
Are you sure it's okay?

218
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:38,520
Besides,

219
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:41,700
what if I fall off

220
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:42,560
in mid-air?

221
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,600
Have you thought about that?

222
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:45,320
Stand firm.

223
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:28,790
We're stable now.

224
00:14:29,270 --> 00:14:30,610
Can you take your hand off me now?

225
00:14:33,530 --> 00:14:34,450
Mo Xiao.

226
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,320
Is that a mountain?

227
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,910
Is that a village down there?

228
00:14:39,840 --> 00:14:40,800
It's so small.

229
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,300
Are those clouds?

230
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,150
(Xuanqing Court)

231
00:15:02,940 --> 00:15:04,170
This is Xuanqing Court.

232
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:09,430
(Xuanqing Court)

233
00:15:09,430 --> 00:15:10,910
Xuanqing Court?
(Xuanqing Court)

234
00:15:11,710 --> 00:15:13,940
I feel like I've been here before.

235
00:15:19,850 --> 00:15:26,330
(Xuanqing Court)

236
00:15:38,110 --> 00:15:39,110
Why...

237
00:15:39,790 --> 00:15:40,990
does it feel so familiar?

238
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:54,580
This is the Shushan Sect?

239
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:56,800
This is the forbidden area of the Shushan Sect.

240
00:15:57,520 --> 00:15:58,840
It's where my master and I

241
00:15:58,940 --> 00:16:00,440
used to seclude ourselves for cultivation.

242
00:16:00,590 --> 00:16:01,390
Master?

243
00:16:01,520 --> 00:16:03,420
So your master is also here?

244
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,520
He passed away when I was 8.

245
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,760
Later, I lived here with my senior and junior disciples.

246
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:09,550
But now, no one lives here anymore.

247
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,920
No one lives here anymore?

248
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,390
Then where do you live now?

249
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:16,010
I am a disciple of the Luntian Branch of the Shushan Sect.

250
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:17,650
Naturally, I need to return and report back.

251
00:16:18,640 --> 00:16:20,400
Then I'll go back with you.

252
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:21,970
Wu Chen,

253
00:16:22,130 --> 00:16:24,490
we don't know when your cold energy will erupt again.

254
00:16:24,860 --> 00:16:26,500
If what happened in Mang Mountain Village were to occur here,

255
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,510
it wouldn't end as well as it did in Mang Mountain Village.

256
00:16:28,970 --> 00:16:30,740
So, it's safer for you to stay here for now.

257
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,420
After I return from reporting,

258
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,620
I'll cure your cold condition and then send you down the mountain.

259
00:16:35,000 --> 00:16:37,170
I've known you for so long,

260
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:39,180
and the thing you say most often

261
00:16:39,210 --> 00:16:40,600
is that you want to send me away.

262
00:16:41,470 --> 00:16:43,130
I've already told you.

263
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,970
You're different from others.

264
00:16:45,150 --> 00:16:46,990
I won't leave you.

265
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:48,880
Wu Chen,

266
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:51,020
I've brought you back to the Shushan Sect

267
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:52,440
to prevent your cold energy from erupting again

268
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,460
and harming innocent people.

269
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,990
But the rules here are strict.

270
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,740
Non-disciples are not allowed to enter.

271
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:00,350
With no other choice,

272
00:17:01,030 --> 00:17:03,170
I brought you to the forbidden area behind the mountain.

273
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,180
Don't worry.

274
00:17:04,369 --> 00:17:05,560
There's a barrier here.

275
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:07,520
No one, except for me, can enter without permission.

276
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,740
You'll be safe as long as you stay here.

277
00:17:09,569 --> 00:17:10,650
But remember,

278
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,550
don't wander around or run off again.

279
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:13,930
You must wait here for me to return.

280
00:17:14,280 --> 00:17:15,000
Once I've finished my business,

281
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:16,720
I'll come back to treat your cold condition.

282
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:19,069
Can I trust you?

283
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:21,960
You can only trust me.

284
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,260
Okay,

285
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,400
I trust you.

286
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:27,589
Then, when you come back,

287
00:17:28,030 --> 00:17:30,390
remember to bring me some glutinous rice balls.

288
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:32,540
Don't worry.

289
00:17:33,270 --> 00:17:34,770
If you stay put here,

290
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,970
I promise you'll have glutinous rice balls every day.

291
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:39,720
I'm off.

292
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:10,350
Supreme Lord,

293
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
he has already brought Wu Chen back to the Shushan Sect.

294
00:18:16,490 --> 00:18:17,090
Supreme Lord,

295
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:19,670
the resonance of the Sacred Stone is diminishing.

296
00:18:23,910 --> 00:18:25,310
The Shushan Sect's barrier...

297
00:18:26,150 --> 00:18:27,680
has interfered with its sensing.

298
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,560
Supreme Lord,

299
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,550
she's in the Shushan Sect now.

300
00:18:30,580 --> 00:18:32,010
Things might become a bit difficult for us.

301
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,410
It doesn't matter.

302
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,000
This is

303
00:18:37,560 --> 00:18:39,640
all part of my plan.

304
00:18:41,350 --> 00:18:44,580
(Luntian Pavilion)

305
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:52,390
(Luntian Pavilion)

306
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:01,630
(Virtue Through the Ages)

307
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,410
Young Sect Leader!

308
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:13,260
(Virtue Through the Ages)

309
00:19:21,140 --> 00:19:22,100
I, disciple Mo Xiao,

310
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,880
have returned safely from slaying the Snow Demon at Mang Mountain

311
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,000
as ordered by you, Master.

312
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:32,740
(Luntian Pavilion)

313
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:35,880
Master.

314
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:37,280
Well done.

315
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,760
As soon as the Young Sect Leader emerged from seclusion,

316
00:19:43,110 --> 00:19:46,860
he took on the great task of defending the world against evil for our Shushan Sect.

317
00:19:47,240 --> 00:19:48,690
Now, he's returned victorious

318
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:50,430
after entering the mortal realm to eliminate the demon.

319
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:52,760
Although your efforts are commendable,

320
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:56,190
you must remain diligent in your cultivation,

321
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:59,080
restrain yourself and return to propriety,

322
00:19:59,470 --> 00:20:00,670
be a good role model

323
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,580
for all your fellow disciples,

324
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:05,110
and accumulate immeasurable merits

325
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:08,310
for our Shushan Immortal Sect's great cause.

326
00:20:10,430 --> 00:20:12,000
Master, I shall remember and uphold your teachings.

327
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:15,040
-We shall remember and uphold your teachings.
-We shall remember and uphold your teachings.

328
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,750
What did you hear?

329
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:34,900
You scared me.

330
00:20:35,830 --> 00:20:37,230
I didn't hear anything.

331
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,960
You're the guilty one here eavesdropping, and yet you're blaming me?

332
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:41,640
I say you should stop eavesdropping.

333
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:42,640
If you want to ask something,

334
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,350
why not just wait until he comes out and ask him directly?

335
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:46,720
You've recounted everything

336
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:48,460
about that Snow Demon?

337
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,810
Yes, I've already covered all the details

338
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,400
about the course of it to you, Master.

339
00:20:53,660 --> 00:20:55,230
Then what's that about being bewitched

340
00:20:55,640 --> 00:20:56,760
by a demoness?

341
00:20:59,430 --> 00:21:00,440
Master, please calm your anger.

342
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:02,170
When I was subduing the Snow Demon,

343
00:21:02,190 --> 00:21:04,070
I did encounter an orphan girl on Mang Mountain.

344
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:06,920
Because I accidentally injured her

345
00:21:06,940 --> 00:21:07,580
while fighting with the Snow Demon,

346
00:21:07,970 --> 00:21:10,050
I brought her down the mountain

347
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:11,320
and treated her wounds in the village.

348
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:14,690
But later, her condition flared up and harmed the villagers.

349
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:15,720
So, those villagers

350
00:21:15,820 --> 00:21:17,410
assumed that I was protecting her.

351
00:21:17,910 --> 00:21:20,720
Is that orphan girl truly a mortal?

352
00:21:22,270 --> 00:21:24,490
I didn't detect any demonic aura from her.

353
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,160
Since it's a misunderstanding by the villagers,

354
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:29,640
where is she now?

355
00:21:30,310 --> 00:21:32,270
Those villagers were overly frightened by the Snow Demon

356
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,200
and became paranoid.

357
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:35,240
They convinced themselves that that orphan girl was a demoness in disguise

358
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:36,960
and even threatened to kill her.

359
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,980
I naturally couldn't stand by and do nothing,

360
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:41,130
so I secretly took her down the mountain

361
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,550
and arranged a...

362
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,370
a safe place

363
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:45,730
for her to recover from her injuries.

364
00:21:46,310 --> 00:21:47,100
Mo Xiao,

365
00:21:47,430 --> 00:21:50,430
you've always been cautious and thorough in your actions since childhood,

366
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,290
never overstepping boundaries or breaking rules.

367
00:21:52,670 --> 00:21:54,030
I believe you have

368
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:55,780
your reasons

369
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:57,280
for handling this matter as you did.

370
00:21:58,410 --> 00:22:00,290
You've had a tiring journey down the mountain.

371
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,640
Go back and rest first.

372
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:04,960
As for the rumors among the villagers,

373
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:08,150
I will send someone to clear them up.

374
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:11,070
You don't need to concern yourself further.

375
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:13,890
Thank you for your understanding, Master.

376
00:22:14,230 --> 00:22:15,040
I'm taking my leave now.

377
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:26,040
My buddy,

378
00:22:26,120 --> 00:22:27,080
it's been a while.

379
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,200
Did you miss me?

380
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:35,280
Young Sect Leader, how was your journey down the mountain

381
00:22:35,380 --> 00:22:36,560
to subdue the demon?

382
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:38,520
Alright, cut it out.

383
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:40,380
Mo Xiao,

384
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,570
are you hurt?

385
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,460
Did you suffer?

386
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:46,770
Mang Mountain must've been freezing.

387
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,190
Did you catch a cold?

388
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:50,160
Can't you see he's standing right here,

389
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,680
alive and well?

390
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:52,760
How could he possibly be injured

391
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:54,200
or catch a cold?

392
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:56,110
Don't just fish for excuses to talk to him, okay?

393
00:22:56,190 --> 00:22:57,830
How am I forcing a conversation?

394
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,600
Is it wrong for me to care about Mo Xiao?

395
00:22:59,790 --> 00:23:00,870
Unlike you,

396
00:23:00,890 --> 00:23:02,880
you only care about that pouch of gold leaves of yours, don't you?

397
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,280
He's already back.

398
00:23:04,350 --> 00:23:05,450
Your concern now is just too little, too late,

399
00:23:05,490 --> 00:23:06,280
understand?

400
00:23:06,350 --> 00:23:07,280
So what if he's injured?

401
00:23:07,300 --> 00:23:08,230
What's the big deal if he's sick?

402
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:09,790
Would you take him to your place and take care of him?

403
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,490
Xie Lingyun, shut up.

404
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:12,760
From now on,

405
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,310
don't you dare say a single word to me.

406
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,040
You think I enjoy talking to you?

407
00:23:16,110 --> 00:23:17,070
You little brat,

408
00:23:17,150 --> 00:23:18,590
what could I possibly have to chat with you about?

409
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:19,590
Fine,

410
00:23:19,710 --> 00:23:20,670
it's a deal!

411
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:24,470
Mo Xiao?

412
00:23:34,430 --> 00:23:36,110
-Welcome back, Young Sect Leader.
-Welcome back, Young Sect Leader.

413
00:23:36,670 --> 00:23:37,670
What are you doing?

414
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:38,830
Get up and speak.

415
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,710
Young Sect Leader,

416
00:23:42,070 --> 00:23:43,390
why didn't you take us three with you this time

417
00:23:43,470 --> 00:23:44,590
when you went down the mountain

418
00:23:44,640 --> 00:23:45,760
to eliminate the demon?

419
00:23:46,200 --> 00:23:47,400
It was dangerous to go alone.

420
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,800
During the days when you were away,

421
00:23:48,840 --> 00:23:50,360
the three of us were very worried about you.

422
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,630
Yes, Young Sect Leader.

423
00:23:51,790 --> 00:23:53,630
We three had guarded your seclusion for ten years,

424
00:23:53,790 --> 00:23:55,710
always responsible for your safety.

425
00:23:55,830 --> 00:23:58,310
This time, you went alone to eliminate the demon,

426
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,800
while we could only stay here and watch.

427
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:01,000
We were really worried.

428
00:24:02,950 --> 00:24:04,000
Stand up first, and let's talk.

429
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,320
You three,

430
00:24:12,420 --> 00:24:13,970
you have so little faith in me?

431
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,110
Young Sect Leader,

432
00:24:15,430 --> 00:24:16,790
our three's inherent mission

433
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:18,150
is to protect your safety.

434
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:18,920
From now on,

435
00:24:19,000 --> 00:24:20,360
no matter what action you take,

436
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,230
please make sure to bring us with you.

437
00:24:26,910 --> 00:24:28,110
Zimu, why have you been so quiet all this time?

438
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,430
Young Sect Leader,

439
00:24:29,590 --> 00:24:31,020
I just feel that you must have

440
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,730
your own considerations for doing this.

441
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,780
I didn't expect Zimu, who is usually quiet,

442
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:37,050
to have such delicate thoughts.

443
00:24:37,310 --> 00:24:38,870
Young Sect Leader, whatever thoughts you have,

444
00:24:38,950 --> 00:24:40,720
naturally, you don't need to explain them to us.

445
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:42,110
We three were overthinking.

446
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:42,960
From now on,

447
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:44,740
no matter what decision you make,

448
00:24:44,770 --> 00:24:46,660
we three will simply obey your orders.

449
00:24:47,050 --> 00:24:47,850
That's right.

450
00:24:48,030 --> 00:24:48,550
Alright.

451
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:49,520
Don't be upset anymore.

452
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:50,510
Get up now.

453
00:24:51,670 --> 00:24:52,110
Come on.

454
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,900
This time, it all happened so suddenly,

455
00:24:55,950 --> 00:24:58,130
and you three had just come out of seclusion with me not long ago.

456
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,720
I didn't want to risk anything happening to you either.

457
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:00,600
Alright.

458
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,600
I promise you

459
00:25:01,630 --> 00:25:02,550
next time I go out,

460
00:25:02,710 --> 00:25:03,670
I will definitely bring you with me.

461
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:07,090
Are you tired, Young Sect Leader?

462
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,320
You've been away for so many days.

463
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:10,160
It's been a while since you've tasted my cooking.

464
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:11,750
What would you like to eat today?

465
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:12,670
I'm not hungry.

466
00:25:13,030 --> 00:25:13,950
Just a bit tired.

467
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:15,390
Young Sect Leader, then you should rest first.

468
00:25:15,470 --> 00:25:16,280
We'll take our leave now.

469
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:23,590
Oh, right, Zisu.

470
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:26,190
Do you know how to make glutinous rice balls?

471
00:25:27,280 --> 00:25:28,760
You want to eat glutinous rice balls?

472
00:25:29,350 --> 00:25:31,920
But you never eat sweets.

473
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:34,970
Is that so?

474
00:25:35,780 --> 00:25:36,440
Never mind, then.

475
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:37,550
Yes, yes,

476
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:38,430
I know how to make them.

477
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,440
I'll go make them right away.

478
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,590
Master,

479
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:46,440
what instructions do you have for me?

480
00:25:48,950 --> 00:25:49,870
Jianchuan.

481
00:25:51,040 --> 00:25:55,210
This time, when Mo Xiao went to Mang Mountain to eliminate the Snow Demon,

482
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:57,720
I heard

483
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:02,040
that a mortal woman was injured by it

484
00:26:02,310 --> 00:26:04,370
and has been afflicted with a peculiar cold condition.

485
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:07,940
I'm ordering you to go investigate the truth.

486
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:15,520
Mo Xiao!

487
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:16,660
(Here, the disciple of the Shushan Sect, Mo Xiao, sincerely asks the aid of you,
Divine Healer, to save a lonely orphan girl...)

488
00:26:16,740 --> 00:26:17,070
(Memoir of Longing)

489
00:26:17,070 --> 00:26:17,820
Mo Xiao!
(Memoir of Longing)

490
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,570
Lower your voice.

491
00:26:20,670 --> 00:26:22,190
You'll scare my Blackie and Whitey.

492
00:26:23,070 --> 00:26:25,230
What kind of spirit pets are those two silly birds, anyway?

493
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:26,200
They've seen me so many times,

494
00:26:26,230 --> 00:26:27,430
yet they still chirp like crazy every time they see me.

495
00:26:27,450 --> 00:26:28,330
They still don't recognize me.

496
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:29,880
Alright.

497
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:31,470
Don't worry. They're not singling you out.

498
00:26:31,560 --> 00:26:33,640
They won't let Zisu, Zifeng, or Zimu touch them either.

499
00:26:34,120 --> 00:26:34,800
I guess

500
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:36,120
they probably find you too noisy,

501
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,000
which is why they keep chirping non-stop.

502
00:26:38,520 --> 00:26:40,760
That's because you've spoiled them rotten.

503
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:43,000
You didn't come here today to help me train the birds, did you?

504
00:26:43,830 --> 00:26:44,470
Of course not.

505
00:26:45,670 --> 00:26:46,950
I came for money.

506
00:26:50,110 --> 00:26:50,750
What money?

507
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,110
Listen, Young Sect Leader of the Shushan Sect,

508
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:54,800
you're not trying to weasel out of this, are you?

509
00:26:54,920 --> 00:26:56,000
Where's my pouch of gold leaves?

510
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:56,760
I spent it all.

511
00:26:56,800 --> 00:26:57,280
You spent...

512
00:26:57,760 --> 00:26:58,920
spent it all?

513
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,110
You...

514
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:02,160
Did you buy property,

515
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,600
or did you start a business?

516
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:04,770
Do you know how much a pouch of gold leaves

517
00:27:04,800 --> 00:27:05,800
is worth?

518
00:27:09,110 --> 00:27:10,430
That money is already gone.

519
00:27:10,710 --> 00:27:11,760
What do you want me to repay you with?

520
00:27:17,590 --> 00:27:18,630
Buddy, sit.

521
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,590
This is very simple.

522
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:22,910
I've already thought of a solution for you.

523
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:25,650
Just give me the artifacts you've refined over the years as collateral.

524
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:27,680
I think that Mind Stone is good.

525
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:28,640
Of course,

526
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:30,200
it's certainly not worth as much as my gold leaves.

527
00:27:30,310 --> 00:27:31,710
But hey, we're brothers, right?

528
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,760
I won't nitpick.

529
00:27:33,030 --> 00:27:33,730
Give it to me.

530
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,080
Young Sect Leader,

531
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,900
don't fall for his nonsense.

532
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,000
Listen, girl,

533
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:40,840
how can you speak so disrespectfully?

534
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,680
I am, after all, the Young Master of the Tielyv Branch.

535
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:43,960
Can't you be a bit more polite?

536
00:27:43,980 --> 00:27:45,560
You always bully our Young Sect Leader.

537
00:27:45,630 --> 00:27:46,480
Me, bully him?

538
00:27:46,510 --> 00:27:47,630
Hand on my heart,

539
00:27:47,650 --> 00:27:50,110
this guy here spent an entire pouch of my gold leaves

540
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:51,940
without even batting an eye.

541
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:54,040
He's clearly the one bullying me, okay?

542
00:27:54,910 --> 00:27:56,150
That's because you brought it upon yourself.

543
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,760
You tried to be clever and ended up losing out.

544
00:27:59,190 --> 00:28:00,350
Glutinous rice balls?

545
00:28:01,280 --> 00:28:01,970
Mo Xiao.

546
00:28:02,280 --> 00:28:03,680
I've known you for so long,

547
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,130
and you've never eaten sweets.

548
00:28:05,160 --> 00:28:07,160
Now, you suddenly want to eat glutinous rice balls?

549
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:13,840
Did the Snow Demon hit you in the head or something?

550
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:16,470
How come you've changed so much after returning from demon hunting?

551
00:28:16,520 --> 00:28:17,760
What are you talking about?

552
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:19,830
Can't I improve my diet

553
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,190
and try something new?

554
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,770
Here, the disciple of the Shushan Sect, Mo Xiao,

555
00:28:30,950 --> 00:28:33,660
sincerely asks the aid of you, Divine Healer, to save a lonely orphan girl.

556
00:28:33,850 --> 00:28:35,340
This girl's condition is peculiar.

557
00:28:35,550 --> 00:28:37,140
There's a strange cold energy within her body.

558
00:28:37,390 --> 00:28:38,560
The cold energy within her is overwhelming,

559
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:40,350
and ordinary humans cannot approach her.

560
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:42,660
When frightened or angered,

561
00:28:42,790 --> 00:28:44,170
frost gathers on her brow,

562
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,360
and her face turns pale.

563
00:28:45,930 --> 00:28:46,970
In her presence,

564
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:48,210
frost spreads within a hundred paces,

565
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:49,860
freezing everything in its path.

566
00:29:20,950 --> 00:29:21,690
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

567
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,900
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

568
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,330
If I don't get the swordsmanship right...

569
00:29:28,470 --> 00:29:29,790
it must be your fault.

570
00:29:38,760 --> 00:29:39,890
Wait for me!

571
00:29:45,230 --> 00:29:48,160
I wonder how Snowy is doing now.

572
00:30:02,400 --> 00:30:04,150
(Spirit Soaring Through the Skies)

573
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,160
What took you so long?

574
00:30:33,070 --> 00:30:34,360
Something held me up.

575
00:30:35,290 --> 00:30:35,950
Oh, right.

576
00:30:36,950 --> 00:30:38,550
I bought you some glutinous rice balls.

577
00:30:50,470 --> 00:30:51,430
Little birds?

578
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:54,250
These are two spirit birds I've raised,

579
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,790
Blackie and Whitey.

580
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,800
I brought them here because I thought you might feel lonely

581
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,400
staying in this courtyard alone.

582
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,200
They don't shy away from you?

583
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:10,800
Do they usually shy away from people's touch?

584
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,280
Besides me,

585
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:13,640
no one has ever touched them.

586
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:15,850
Looks like...

587
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:17,950
you have a special connection with them.

588
00:31:19,230 --> 00:31:20,470
Of course,

589
00:31:20,830 --> 00:31:22,760
I'm not like the others.

590
00:31:24,910 --> 00:31:26,480
Quick, give me your hand!

591
00:31:31,110 --> 00:31:32,870
Could it be that they still remember you?

592
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:40,620
What's wrong?

593
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,060
Don't you like them?

594
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:45,000
It's not that I don't like birds.

595
00:31:45,230 --> 00:31:47,110
They just remind me of my Snowy.

596
00:31:47,920 --> 00:31:49,610
I've left Mang Mountain,

597
00:31:49,950 --> 00:31:51,610
but Snowy is still there.

598
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:54,470
I don't know if she'll be able to find

599
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:56,920
any wild berries to eat on her own.

600
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,870
If you're worried,

601
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,130
I can make time to go back to Mang Mountain

602
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:02,390
and bring Snowy here.

603
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:03,520
Really?

604
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,940
It's getting late.

605
00:32:08,110 --> 00:32:08,880
I should head back now.

606
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,920
Leaving so soon?

607
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:21,330
Oh, right.

608
00:32:24,030 --> 00:32:24,950
This is the Mind Stone.

609
00:32:25,490 --> 00:32:26,520
Keep it with you.

610
00:32:27,230 --> 00:32:28,030
If anything happens,

611
00:32:28,070 --> 00:32:29,330
you can use it to summon me.

612
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:30,640
I'll come right away.

613
00:32:35,490 --> 00:32:36,440
Rest early.

614
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:24,420
Mo Xiao.

615
00:33:25,230 --> 00:33:26,150
What is it?

616
00:33:28,790 --> 00:33:30,350
I didn't expect this to actually work!

617
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:33,510
No need to test it again.

618
00:33:34,030 --> 00:33:35,950
Call me when you really need me.

619
00:33:53,580 --> 00:33:54,500
What is it now?

620
00:33:55,470 --> 00:33:58,580
Why won't they let me hold them while I sleep?

621
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:01,400
You want to hold them while you sleep?

622
00:34:02,980 --> 00:34:05,470
When I was on Mang Mountain,

623
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:08,010
I always slept while holding Snowy.

624
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,449
These two aren't like Snowy.

625
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,250
They can't cuddle with you on the bed.

626
00:34:29,630 --> 00:34:30,520
Go to sleep now.

627
00:34:30,920 --> 00:34:34,199
Can you wait until I fall asleep before you leave?

628
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,920
Yesterday,

629
00:34:49,320 --> 00:34:51,710
I received a letter from the head of the Tianyu Sect,

630
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:55,989
inviting Mo Xiao to attend a discourse on the Dao.

631
00:34:56,590 --> 00:34:58,510
It must be because of our Shushan Sect's Young Sect Leader's

632
00:34:58,590 --> 00:34:59,750
recent demon-slaying journey

633
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,520
that has spread his name far and wide.

634
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:03,730
This is a great opportunity

635
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:05,080
to showcase

636
00:35:05,160 --> 00:35:07,360
the style and grace of our Shushan's sword immortals.

637
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:08,280
That's right.

638
00:35:08,710 --> 00:35:09,520
Mo Xiao.

639
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:12,710
Yes, Master.

640
00:35:12,750 --> 00:35:15,310
Since this is an invitation from the head of the Tianyu Sect,

641
00:35:15,550 --> 00:35:17,390
you should depart immediately.

642
00:35:18,080 --> 00:35:20,300
They are holding a recruitment event,

643
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:22,770
which will be a good opportunity for you to gain some experience.

644
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:23,950
Yes, Master.

645
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,950
Come on, come on, quickly, sit back.

646
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:31,310
Me...

647
00:35:33,230 --> 00:35:33,910
Lingyun,

648
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,080
do you have something to say?

649
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,880
Sect Leader,

650
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,050
I have nothing to say.

651
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,200
Well, if there's nothing else,

652
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,430
everyone, dismissed.

653
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:44,360
Okay.

654
00:35:50,880 --> 00:35:51,290
Zisu!

655
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:51,360
(Virtuous Radiance)
Zisu!

656
00:35:51,360 --> 00:35:52,350
(Virtuous Radiance)

657
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:53,380
Where is your Young Sect Leader?
(Virtuous Radiance)

658
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,020
(Virtuous Radiance)

659
00:35:58,870 --> 00:35:59,830
You rude girl,

660
00:35:59,850 --> 00:36:02,130
can you change this bad habit of ignoring people?

661
00:36:02,310 --> 00:36:04,230
Be careful, or you might not be able to get married in the future.

662
00:36:04,470 --> 00:36:05,520
Who says I want to get married?

663
00:36:06,170 --> 00:36:07,010
What?

664
00:36:07,190 --> 00:36:08,280
You don't want to get married?

665
00:36:08,390 --> 00:36:10,710
Don't tell me you're going to stay with your Young Sect Leader for life.

666
00:36:10,870 --> 00:36:11,430
That's right.

667
00:36:11,800 --> 00:36:13,950
I'll make glutinous rice balls for the Young Sect Leader for life.

668
00:36:14,040 --> 00:36:15,210
Glutinous rice balls?

669
00:36:15,450 --> 00:36:16,990
This guy wants to eat glutinous rice balls again?

670
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:17,830
Yes.

671
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:19,360
For the first time in his life,

672
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:21,020
he's craved something like this.

673
00:36:21,080 --> 00:36:22,200
Before he left on the long journey this time,

674
00:36:22,230 --> 00:36:23,620
he especially asked me to make more.

675
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,400
I guess he wants to take them to eat on the road.

676
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,230
He already left?

677
00:36:27,320 --> 00:36:27,950
When?

678
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:29,710
Just now.

679
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,980
Oh no.

680
00:36:50,020 --> 00:36:50,890
Come out.

681
00:36:56,590 --> 00:36:58,230
Since I've followed you all the way here,

682
00:36:58,310 --> 00:36:59,590
there's no need for you to hide anything anymore.

683
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:02,460
You little rascal, are you hiding a beauty in here?

684
00:37:02,630 --> 00:37:04,540
I'd like to see what kind of beauty

685
00:37:04,670 --> 00:37:06,430
likes to eat these glutinous rice balls.

686
00:37:06,550 --> 00:37:07,870
It's not what you think.

687
00:37:09,110 --> 00:37:10,550
You're quite good at hiding people, aren't you?

688
00:37:10,670 --> 00:37:11,670
Hiding her in this place.

689
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,320
Sect Leader definitely won't find out.

690
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:14,740
It's not that I'm good at hiding people.

691
00:37:14,760 --> 00:37:16,090
I just don't want to cause trouble.

692
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,190
Who are you?

693
00:37:25,630 --> 00:37:26,440
Wu Chen.

694
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:27,520
This is...

695
00:37:27,640 --> 00:37:29,440
So, this is the woman you brought back?

696
00:37:29,830 --> 00:37:31,710
I don't see anything special about her appearance.

697
00:37:32,150 --> 00:37:33,630
What does "appearance" mean?

698
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,520
Are you a bit slow in the head?

699
00:37:35,600 --> 00:37:37,250
What does that mean?

700
00:37:37,790 --> 00:37:39,570
Do you think I'm stupid,

701
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:40,880
or is she really stupid?

702
00:37:41,150 --> 00:37:42,410
She thinks you're stupid.

703
00:37:42,910 --> 00:37:43,520
Alright.

704
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,280
Miss Wu Chen

705
00:37:44,300 --> 00:37:45,580
grew up in the snow plains of Mang Mountain.

706
00:37:45,610 --> 00:37:46,580
She's unfamiliar with the ways of the world.

707
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:47,800
Don't mess around.

708
00:37:48,280 --> 00:37:49,650
Your name is Wu Chen, right?

709
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,390
Then, let me introduce myself too.

710
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:52,950
I am

711
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:54,800
handsome beyond compare, graceful as a jade orchid,

712
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:57,040
and the unparalleled Young Master of the Tielyv Branch of the Shushan Sect,

713
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,290
Xie Lingyun.

714
00:38:00,260 --> 00:38:02,650
Why is his name so long?

715
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:03,920
Because he's stupid.

716
00:38:04,910 --> 00:38:06,430
His name is Xie Lingyun.

717
00:38:06,630 --> 00:38:08,110
Xie Lingyun?

718
00:38:09,790 --> 00:38:11,860
You're the one who gave us those gold leaves.

719
00:38:12,510 --> 00:38:14,320
And they were all spent by you, right?

720
00:38:14,360 --> 00:38:16,000
I exchanged them for things.

721
00:38:16,190 --> 00:38:16,710
Exchange?

722
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,110
That's called "buying."

723
00:38:18,390 --> 00:38:19,150
What did you buy?

724
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:23,110
I exchanged them for glutinous rice balls,

725
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:24,250
clothes,

726
00:38:24,470 --> 00:38:25,880
and a pinwheel.

727
00:38:26,160 --> 00:38:28,200
Anyway, those gold leaves were really useful.

728
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:30,160
Can you bring us more next time?

729
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:31,000
Next time?

730
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:32,750
I can't believe you actually said that.

731
00:38:33,470 --> 00:38:35,520
I must say, you two are a perfect match.

732
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:36,510
Don't talk nonsense.

733
00:38:36,910 --> 00:38:37,770
Come in with me.

734
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:38,760
I've got serious business to discuss with you.

735
00:38:39,320 --> 00:38:40,010
Wu Chen.

736
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:42,360
Glutinous rice balls?

737
00:38:55,610 --> 00:38:57,680
You want me to take care of Wu Chen?

738
00:38:57,770 --> 00:38:58,930
No, no, no, Mo Xiao.

739
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,200
If her cold condition flares up,

740
00:39:00,230 --> 00:39:01,320
I really can't handle it.

741
00:39:01,340 --> 00:39:02,080
Besides,

742
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,480
if the Sect Leader finds out,

743
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:04,950
he'll definitely lock me up in the Tielyv Branch,

744
00:39:04,970 --> 00:39:06,600
and my dad would beat me half to death.

745
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:07,400
Mo Xiao,

746
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,880
we're brothers.

747
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,350
You can't throw me under the bus like this.

748
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,670
I've set up a barrier outside Xuanqing Court.

749
00:39:12,790 --> 00:39:14,630
I'll tell you how to open this barrier.

750
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:15,520
Don't worry.

751
00:39:15,640 --> 00:39:16,760
No one else can get in.

752
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,960
But that's not a solution if it goes on for too long, right?

753
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,870
It won't be for too long.

754
00:39:22,230 --> 00:39:23,840
I'm looking for someone to help treat her cold condition.

755
00:39:24,110 --> 00:39:25,690
Once Wu Chen's cold condition is cured,

756
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:26,880
I'll send her down the mountain

757
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:28,390
and let her live a quiet life in some ordinary town.

758
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,390
Who are you looking for?

759
00:39:30,440 --> 00:39:31,620
Speaking of this person,

760
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,800
I still need to ask for your help.

761
00:39:32,910 --> 00:39:34,840
Help me find the best peach blossom wine in the world.

762
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,000
Peach blossom wine?

763
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:42,970
Could the person you're looking for be the Divine Healer, Shi Bujiu?

764
00:39:43,000 --> 00:39:43,430
That's right.

765
00:39:45,980 --> 00:39:46,840
Blackie.

766
00:39:55,620 --> 00:39:56,530
Mo Xiao.

767
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:04,320
Mo Xiao.

768
00:40:04,650 --> 00:40:06,300
Why do you look like you're afraid of her?

769
00:40:06,430 --> 00:40:07,560
You're afraid of me?

770
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:09,600
Why...

771
00:40:10,960 --> 00:40:12,040
why would I be afraid of you?

772
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:15,760
Look at you,

773
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:18,150
it's like you're afraid she's gonna eat you alive or something.

774
00:40:28,230 --> 00:40:28,840
Mo Xiao.

775
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:31,250
You're blushing.

776
00:40:31,510 --> 00:40:33,370
This is the first time in my life that I've seen you blush.

777
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,180
Tell me,

778
00:40:34,470 --> 00:40:35,630
are you hiding something from me?

779
00:40:35,650 --> 00:40:36,680
Come clean!

780
00:40:37,560 --> 00:40:38,040
I...

781
00:40:39,470 --> 00:40:40,750
You're blushing.

782
00:40:40,910 --> 00:40:41,950
Are you feeling hot?

783
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:45,750
Mind your manners.

784
00:40:48,830 --> 00:40:49,750
Wu Chen,

785
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:51,880
on my master's orders, I have to go on a long journey

786
00:40:51,970 --> 00:40:53,400
and won't be back for several days.

787
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,900
During that time,

788
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:56,590
Xie Lingyun will come look after you.

789
00:40:56,830 --> 00:40:57,850
You stay here

790
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:00,090
and practice the Ice Sword Technique that I taught you well.

791
00:41:00,170 --> 00:41:01,480
Remember, do not wander around.

792
00:41:01,710 --> 00:41:02,560
Can't I come with you?

793
00:41:02,580 --> 00:41:03,370
No.

794
00:41:07,190 --> 00:41:07,830
However...

795
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:09,590
if you really have something urgent,

796
00:41:09,830 --> 00:41:11,190
use the Mind Stone to summon me.

797
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:12,320
I will appear at any time.

798
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,580
Mind Stone?

799
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:15,710
You gave her the Mind Stone?

800
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:17,950
He gave it to me.

801
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:18,710
Mo Xiao,

802
00:41:18,980 --> 00:41:20,540
you've really crossed the line this time!

803
00:41:20,810 --> 00:41:22,520
I've asked you for that stone for so many years,

804
00:41:22,550 --> 00:41:23,590
and you've never been willing to give it to me!

805
00:41:23,610 --> 00:41:24,550
And now what?

806
00:41:24,640 --> 00:41:26,560
You just handed it over to this girl you've barely known for five minutes?

807
00:41:29,630 --> 00:41:30,920
You must give me a

808
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,120
reasonable explanation today.

809
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:33,980
You, the dignified Young Master of the Tielyv Branch,

810
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:34,880
have the Moye sword for protection,

811
00:41:34,910 --> 00:41:36,690
as well as so many mechanical gadgets up your sleeves.

812
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,040
Having my Mind Stone

813
00:41:38,060 --> 00:41:39,570
would just be adding another toy to your collection.

814
00:41:39,640 --> 00:41:41,430
Giving it to you would be a real waste.

815
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:46,170
Whether I use it or not is my business.

816
00:41:46,310 --> 00:41:48,180
Whether you give it or not is your business.
