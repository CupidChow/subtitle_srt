00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,690
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,800
(Episode 40)

3
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,440
Let's go help Mo Xiao.

4
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:48,050
Mo Xiao,

5
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,330
we're here to help you.

6
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,480
You're not the only one.

7
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:19,560
You've been secretly refining my demonic power,

8
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,040
yet not a single one of you

9
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:23,040
can truly replace me.

10
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,690
I can tell you why.

11
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:30,720
Because

12
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,480
you were all refined using my blood of immortality.

13
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:38,120
And the blood of immortality knows its master.

14
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,150
It would never harm its master.

15
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:43,980
So,

16
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:46,400
you can't hurt me at all.

17
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:47,980
Understand?

18
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:51,880
I can't hurt you,

19
00:04:52,890 --> 00:04:54,680
but I can hurt her.

20
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:34,180
Chongguang,

21
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:36,240
the Blood Demon Pearl is your lifeline.

22
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:37,440
If the Blood Demon Pearl breaks,

23
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:39,480
your primordial spirit will have no chance of recovery.

24
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:41,540
You won't be able to resurrect again.

25
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:40,810
Quickly, take her away.

26
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:43,510
Hurry, get her out of here.

27
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,580
I told you to take her away.

28
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:10,980
I've already struck Chongguang's vital point.

29
00:07:11,920 --> 00:07:13,040
He can't stop me.

30
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:15,280
You can't stop me either.

31
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,840
No one can stop me.

32
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:19,910
Murong Changfeng,

33
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:21,740
you have brought disaster to the Shushan Sect,
harming your fellow disciples.

34
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:22,740
You are heartless and insane,

35
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,880
deserving death a thousand times over.

36
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,760
Today,

37
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,200
I shall take your life on behalf of the Sword Sovereigns of Shushan,

38
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:29,600
shatter your cultivation,

39
00:08:29,600 --> 00:08:30,730
and avenge my master

40
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,000
and the countless disciples who perished because of you.

41
00:10:54,840 --> 00:10:55,550
Nihuang,

42
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,760
as long as the seal of the Millennium Token remains intact,

43
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,080
you will live in peace

44
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,640
for generations to come.

45
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,860
Whether it was a thousand years ago

46
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:06,980
or today,

47
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,760
my only wish is for you to live a good life.

48
00:11:47,280 --> 00:11:48,400
Mo Xiao,

49
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,640
come down here.

50
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:52,280
You're no longer a disciple of the Shushan Sect.

51
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,480
There's no need to sacrifice yourself to seal the token.

52
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:55,660
Mo Xiao!

53
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,110
Mo Xiao,

54
00:11:57,280 --> 00:11:58,240
sealing the token with your own body

55
00:11:58,240 --> 00:11:59,880
will disintegrate your bones, drain your blood,

56
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:00,780
and destroy both your body and soul,

57
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:02,520
leaving you without any of your cultivation.

58
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:03,960
You can't do it!

59
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:05,710
Mo Xiao!

60
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,760
Mo Xiao!

61
00:12:07,170 --> 00:12:08,520
The Sword Sovereign's final wish

62
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,310
was never for you to sacrifice your life and blood.

63
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:11,550
Come down first.

64
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,840
We must explore other solutions.

65
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:15,400
If nothing else works,

66
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,880
we can open the Sword Pavilion and offer sacrifices to the heavens,

67
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:20,010
asking the divine lords to reseal the Millennium Token.

68
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,790
Why destroy yourself?

69
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:31,680
Lingyun,

70
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:33,600
I'm sorry.

71
00:12:34,760 --> 00:12:37,680
The sealing process of the Millennium Token must remain undisturbed.

72
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:40,120
If interrupted, Nihuang will be detected by the Heavenly Realm,

73
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:43,650
and all our efforts over the past thousand years will be in vain.

74
00:12:44,120 --> 00:12:45,270
Go!

75
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:00,690
Lingyun,

76
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:01,580
Jing,

77
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,520
Murong Ce.

78
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:06,040
-To have the chance to walk alongside you in this life...
-Mo Xiao!

79
00:13:06,040 --> 00:13:07,880
-Is already my great fortune.
-Mo Xiao!

80
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:10,320
-Mo Xiao!
-I can't repay your kindness.

81
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:13,320
It can only wait until the next life.

82
00:13:13,850 --> 00:13:16,280
Please return the Fengyue Sword to the Shushan Sect on my behalf

83
00:13:16,280 --> 00:13:19,120
and report back to the Sword Sovereigns' spirits for me.

84
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:20,720
As for the Millennium Token,

85
00:13:21,160 --> 00:13:22,890
I will protect it without fail.

86
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:25,120
Go back now.

87
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,490
Master,

88
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,060
why did you bring me to Mang Mountain?

89
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:09,490
Because this is

90
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,800
where our fates first intertwined.

91
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,020
As a girl grows up,

92
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,140
the first thing she needs to learn

93
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:20,030
is how to pin up her own hair.

94
00:16:20,930 --> 00:16:22,330
We are one.

95
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,200
You

96
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:24,660
will forever

97
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:25,720
and always

98
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,480
be my Lixue.

99
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,200
Whatever you wish to do,

100
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,780
I will support you.

101
00:16:32,240 --> 00:16:34,040
I can't bring myself to hate you,

102
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,300
nor can I love you.

103
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:38,090
Our bond as master and disciple

104
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:40,520
ends here.

105
00:16:41,140 --> 00:16:42,580
From now on,

106
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:44,420
all ties between us are severed!

107
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:48,030
Right or wrong,

108
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,820
gain or loss,

109
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,080
I just want to possess it,

110
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,380
even if only for a day,

111
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,440
it's enough to help me endure

112
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:59,380
those lonely years.

113
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,960
The Millennium Token cannot be opened.

114
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,720
It can't be.

115
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,290
This is the last time

116
00:19:11,240 --> 00:19:13,900
I'll feed you the blood of immortality.

117
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:19,650
I've told you long ago.

118
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:22,020
We are one.

119
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,070
We rise together

120
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:25,610
and fall together.

121
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,930
It's not just because of the Ice Blue Moth.

122
00:19:29,560 --> 00:19:30,740
It's because

123
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,840
our bloodlines are connected.

124
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:37,640
You

125
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,800
are a part of me.

126
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:44,870
Why did you do this?

127
00:20:22,800 --> 00:20:24,530
I used the blood of immortality

128
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,560
to bring you back to life.

129
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:30,900
I thought that

130
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,310
in the long, endless years ahead,

131
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:37,450
you would always be by my side.

132
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,720
So in the past,

133
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:44,000
no matter how much you resented me, hated me, or hurt me,

134
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:47,000
I didn't mind.

135
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,190
I thought I had

136
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,260
all the time in the world

137
00:20:52,840 --> 00:20:54,470
to make it up to you,

138
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,360
to save you.

139
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:07,380
I believed, in the end,

140
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:10,540
the only one who could stay by your side

141
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,900
would be me.

♫A vow to remain together forever♫

187
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,990
You gave me the Ice Blue Moth?

188
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:31,560
♫Etched at the summit of love and sorrow♫

Master,

223
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,760
you gave me a new life here,

224
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:14,750
and here, I'll lay you to rest forever.

225
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,200
He deserves a beating.

226
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,500
Nihuang, teach him a lesson for us.

227
00:25:56,500 --> 00:25:58,200
Yes, teach him a lesson.

228
00:26:01,070 --> 00:26:01,990
Who are you?

229
00:26:02,010 --> 00:26:03,580
What are you doing here?

230
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,360
I am the senior.

231
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,160
You are the junior.

232
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,300
If anyone should go fetch water, it's you.

233
00:26:07,300 --> 00:26:08,650
I'm older than you,

234
00:26:08,680 --> 00:26:10,150
I'm the senior, so you go.

235
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,280
I joined earlier,

236
00:26:11,300 --> 00:26:12,790
so I'm the senior. You go.

237
00:26:16,320 --> 00:26:17,200
From now on,

238
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:20,880
no one in the three realms will be able to find you,

239
00:26:21,050 --> 00:26:22,240
except for me.

240
00:26:25,330 --> 00:26:26,150
Bai Yan,

241
00:26:26,170 --> 00:26:28,000
you have protected the Heavenly Realm for ten thousand years.

242
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,220
Today, let me protect you.

243
00:26:30,450 --> 00:26:32,120
If the three realms seek to harm you,

244
00:26:32,120 --> 00:26:34,190
then I will fight against them all!

245
00:28:53,510 --> 00:29:00,460
(Mount Buzhou)

246
00:29:04,650 --> 00:29:05,570
Floren,

247
00:29:05,930 --> 00:29:07,530
you've been guarding him here all this time,

248
00:29:07,530 --> 00:29:08,260
haven't you?

249
00:29:13,360 --> 00:29:14,370
He's foolish,

250
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:15,760
isn't he?

251
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:17,930
He's the same God of War,

252
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:19,760
hasn't changed a bit.

253
00:29:19,760 --> 00:29:20,440
(Mount Buzhou)

254
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:23,040
For the ones he loves and for all living beings,
(Mount Buzhou)

255
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:23,680
(Mount Buzhou)

256
00:29:23,680 --> 00:29:24,810
he's willing to make
(Mount Buzhou)

257
00:29:24,810 --> 00:29:25,630
(Mount Buzhou)

258
00:29:25,630 --> 00:29:26,970
any sacrifice without hesitation.
(Mount Buzhou)

259
00:29:26,970 --> 00:29:27,630
any sacrifice without hesitation.

260
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:28,320
Truly,

261
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,560
he's admirable in many ways.

262
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,370
However, there's one flaw.

263
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:34,920
He inevitably causes sorrow to others.

264
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:37,070
But, you mustn't try to stop him.

265
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:38,160
Why?

266
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,960
You are the Seven-Colored Fire Phoenix.

267
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,020
Anyone else can go,

268
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,280
but you can't.

269
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:46,290
Floren, you don't understand.

270
00:29:46,680 --> 00:29:48,480
Anyone else can choose not to go,

271
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:49,560
but

272
00:29:50,360 --> 00:29:51,240
I can't.

273
00:29:54,690 --> 00:30:00,520
(Mount Buzhou)

274
00:30:04,520 --> 00:30:05,120
Mo Xiao.

275
00:30:09,310 --> 00:30:10,390
Let me help you.

276
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,750
Nihuang.

277
00:31:16,660 --> 00:31:17,320
Mo Xiao.

278
00:31:18,450 --> 00:31:19,170
Mo Xiao.

279
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:21,560
Mo Xiao.

280
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:23,810
Why are you still

281
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,030
being so foolish?

282
00:31:33,970 --> 00:31:35,310
Do you know?

283
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:37,560
In this world,

284
00:31:38,590 --> 00:31:41,110
I only wish for you to live well.

285
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,950
But would it really be good

286
00:31:44,980 --> 00:31:46,140
to leave me alone?

287
00:31:55,110 --> 00:31:55,950
Nihuang,

288
00:31:56,750 --> 00:31:58,610
I think it's time for you to leave.

289
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,870
Once the Millennium Token is activated again,

290
00:32:00,870 --> 00:32:02,780
the Heavenly Realm will surely detect your spiritual breath.

291
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,550
If that happens,

292
00:32:03,550 --> 00:32:04,950
all these thousand years

293
00:32:04,950 --> 00:32:06,330
will have been for nothing.

294
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,700
A thousand years ago,

295
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:10,240
you saved me with your Loong Pearl.

296
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,080
But now,

297
00:32:12,730 --> 00:32:14,730
you don't have a second Loong Pearl.

298
00:32:15,670 --> 00:32:17,900
Are you really going to risk your primordial spirit and physical body to save me?

299
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:19,930
Because I want you to live well.

300
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:23,450
Nihuang,

301
00:32:24,900 --> 00:32:25,560
go quickly.

302
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,690
Go to the valley, go to Fengdu City,

303
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:29,420
or anywhere else you want to go.

304
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,480
This mortal world is beautiful.

305
00:32:32,820 --> 00:32:34,570
It's worth living for.

306
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,290
Go.

307
00:32:35,590 --> 00:32:36,630
Go quickly.

308
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:51,440
Mo Xiao.

309
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:56,540
The Millennium Token came into existence because of me.

310
00:32:56,730 --> 00:33:00,520
You once sealed the token with yourself and slept for a thousand years.

311
00:33:00,520 --> 00:33:01,480
Now,

312
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:05,590
it should be me who brings an end to this.

313
00:33:17,540 --> 00:33:18,630

In recognition of her benevolence and kindness to the people,

356
00:36:29,190 --> 00:36:32,610
the Heavenly Emperor has pardoned the Winged Clan,
allowing them to return to the divine race in the Heavenly Realm,

357
00:36:32,610 --> 00:36:34,610
and has conferred upon Yu Qing

358
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:38,420
the title of High Immortal.

359
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:54,220
Grandpa Crane, have some tea.

360
00:37:01,060 --> 00:37:02,150
Grandpa Crane,

361
00:37:02,170 --> 00:37:03,770
may I borrow your spirit fan?

362
00:37:05,750 --> 00:37:06,970
That's my fan...

363
00:37:06,990 --> 00:37:08,490
It's a treasure!

364
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:09,840
Nihuang,

365
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:11,830
why are you in such a hurry?

366
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,920
I'm going down the mountain.

367
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:13,880
What for?

368
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,320
I received guidance from a divine lord in my dream.

369
00:37:16,320 --> 00:37:19,720
He told me to go to the Shushan Sect to cultivate immortality.

370
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:22,290
A divine lord?

371
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,560
What divine lord?

372
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:26,440
Jing,

373
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,760
this is the gift I've carefully prepared for you.

374
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,090
I'm sure you'll like it.

375
00:37:30,440 --> 00:37:31,280
What is it?

376
00:37:31,400 --> 00:37:33,320
-Don’t rush.
-Let me see.

377
00:37:33,340 --> 00:37:35,140
-Countdown to three.
-Hurry up.

378
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:35,960
Three,

379
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:37,000
two,

380
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,000
one.

381
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,480
Why is it this again?

382
00:37:41,930 --> 00:37:42,930
Don't you like it?

383
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:43,880
I don't.

384
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:45,760
I like that one.

385
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:46,400
This one?

386
00:37:46,480 --> 00:37:47,010
Alright,

387
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,520
I'll make you a bigger

388
00:37:48,600 --> 00:37:49,200
and more beautiful one next time.

389
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,060
How about that?

390
00:38:03,470 --> 00:38:05,480
Last time, at my succession ceremony as Sect Leader,

391
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,330
you were late because you were goofing off.

392
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:08,860
Today is your wedding day.

393
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,340
Are you going to keep all the guests waiting?

394
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,280
Master Xie and Master Xuan Zhen

395
00:38:13,280 --> 00:38:14,570
are already in the front hall.

396
00:38:14,570 --> 00:38:16,490
Xie Lingyun, why aren't you going over there?

397
00:38:16,490 --> 00:38:18,150
What kind of behavior is this?

398
00:38:18,760 --> 00:38:20,220
It's all Lingyun's fault.

399
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:22,560
He said he made me a wedding gift.

400
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,960
I was curious,

401
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,340
so I came to take a look.

402
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:27,640
You're just acting spoiled.

403
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:30,520
Alright, Ce,

404
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,520
why let anger spoil such a joyous day?

405
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,840
We're about to become family, after all.

406
00:38:33,840 --> 00:38:34,960
Today, we'll do things your way.

407
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:35,800
Let's go.

408
00:38:37,260 --> 00:38:38,060
Jing,

409
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:43,840
you're the bride.

410
00:38:43,860 --> 00:38:44,990
Where are you going?

411
00:38:48,590 --> 00:38:50,120
Then I'll wait for you here.

412
00:38:50,680 --> 00:38:51,340
Wait for me.

413
00:39:06,440 --> 00:39:07,160
Today,

414
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,830
the young masters from the Tielyv Branch and the Fengyu Branch are getting married.

415
00:39:09,830 --> 00:39:11,020
It's a joyous occasion for our Shushan Sect.

416
00:39:11,020 --> 00:39:12,080
You new disciples

417
00:39:12,110 --> 00:39:13,580
get to drink wedding wine right after joining.

418
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:14,820
You're so lucky.

419
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:13,260
Miss,

420
00:40:16,870 --> 00:40:18,930
may I ask if this is Shushan Sect?

421
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:22,360
Divine Lord?

422
00:40:30,390 --> 00:40:33,190
I am a newly admitted disciple of the Shushan Sect.

423
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:33,960
My name is Bai Yan.
