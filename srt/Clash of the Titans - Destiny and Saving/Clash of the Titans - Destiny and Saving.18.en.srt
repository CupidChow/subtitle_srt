00:01:31,090 --> 00:01:35,710
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:38,700
(Episode 18)

3
00:02:03,410 --> 00:02:04,740
Aren't you going to ask?

4
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,020
Ask what?

5
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,039
Where's the antidote?

6
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:10,820
Antidote?

7
00:02:20,990 --> 00:02:22,670
You weren't poisoned at all.

8
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:24,210
Weren't you?

9
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,730
You figured it out long ago?

10
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:36,530
That's right.

11
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:43,770
I was indeed affected by the Love and Desire Poison.

12
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,840
but it didn't attack my heart.

13
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:50,170
I deceived Chongguang.

14
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,280
But precisely because the Love and Desire Poison didn't affect my heart,

15
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:55,460
all of this,

16
00:02:56,420 --> 00:02:57,820
everything you've seen,

17
00:02:58,329 --> 00:02:59,660
the Mo Xiao you've seen,

18
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:02,430
none of it was fake.

19
00:03:04,550 --> 00:03:06,130
Why did you do this?

20
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:08,470
You knew very well

21
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,790
that I wanted to kill you.

22
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,050
Because only this way

23
00:03:14,980 --> 00:03:16,370
could I take this opportunity

24
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:17,970
to show you my true feelings.

25
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:20,340
I actually wish

26
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,760
that all of this,

27
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,130
this dream,

28
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,940
would never end.

29
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,920
But this dream

30
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:34,050
still has to end.

31
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,040
Yes.

32
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,140
Because I am Mo Xiao.

33
00:03:48,610 --> 00:03:50,670
I am the Young Sect Leader of the Shushan Sect.

34
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,270
I am the successor of Sword Sovereign Fengyue.

35
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,610
I am the hope of many people.

36
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:00,300
I must rescue my fellows

37
00:04:00,670 --> 00:04:02,330
and my martial arts brethren.

38
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,940
I also need to destroy the Demon Lord's plot.

39
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,670
This is my destined mission.

40
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:24,790
Are you willing to sacrifice yourself

41
00:04:25,450 --> 00:04:26,890
for these people?

42
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:38,530
Those people include you.

43
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:41,710
Lixue.

44
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,909
The person I want to save the most

45
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,260
is you.

46
00:04:47,110 --> 00:04:48,530
Even if it means death,

47
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:50,970
you must save me?

48
00:04:51,740 --> 00:04:53,000
Even if it means death,

49
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:55,530
I must save you.

50
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,330
Alright.

51
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:06,100
I'll tell you where the antidote is.

52
00:05:06,820 --> 00:05:07,600
The antidote is in

53
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,400
the Crimson Abyss behind the River of Liberation.

54
00:05:10,500 --> 00:05:11,710
The Crimson Abyss,

55
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,350
with waves red as fire,

56
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:16,790
is extremely dangerous. No one has ever crossed it.

57
00:05:17,070 --> 00:05:18,200
Are you still going?

58
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,910
We, the Immortal Sect of Shushan,

59
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:24,570
take it as our duty to protect all living beings.

60
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:27,360
In the face of life and death,

61
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:29,460
I have no choice.

62
00:05:30,920 --> 00:05:32,320
There is no other option.

63
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:34,760
I have never seen someone like you,

64
00:05:35,159 --> 00:05:36,830
so foolish.

65
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:39,460
Wait for me to return.

66
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:25,600
Niu.

67
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:26,620
You're back so early.

68
00:06:26,620 --> 00:06:27,510
Yeah.

69
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:28,880
We've been delivering water for several night shifts in a row.

70
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:30,140
We're exhausted.

71
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:31,820
You should get some sleep too.

72
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:01,050
Let's go.

73
00:07:05,050 --> 00:07:05,890
Lingyun,

74
00:07:05,920 --> 00:07:07,120
what should we do now?

75
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:11,100
Anyway, we've already got the token

76
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:12,390
that can pass through the barrier.

77
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,250
We can't get out right now anyway.

78
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:16,650
Why don't we just look around here?

79
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,360
Look around?

80
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:19,630
At a time like this?

81
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:22,680
We can adapt to the situation as it unfolds.

82
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,170
There are still a few hours until dawn anyway.

83
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,750
Maybe we can find Mo Xiao

84
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,790
before dawn.

85
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:30,320
Let's go.

86
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,440
This couldn't be the dungeon

87
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,170
Senior Lu mentioned, could it?

88
00:07:57,190 --> 00:07:59,659
We've been searching for Mo Xiao for a long time without any luck.

89
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:01,880
I guess he must be imprisoned here.

90
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:03,270
Let's take a look.

91
00:08:09,530 --> 00:08:10,860
What are you doing here?

92
00:08:14,950 --> 00:08:17,280
Are you here to select a Sacrificial Spirit too?

93
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:17,910
Hurry up.

94
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:58,290
To cross the Crimson Abyss,

95
00:08:58,790 --> 00:09:00,370
only those unmoved by the seven emotions

96
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:02,170
can pass through successfully.

97
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,670
If you have worldly attachments in your heart,

98
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:09,230
your feet will suffer the pain of rotting bones.

99
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:12,530
You cannot use any magical powers.

100
00:09:12,730 --> 00:09:15,430
You can only come to me as a mortal being.

101
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,600
After you get through,

102
00:09:18,330 --> 00:09:20,330
I will give you whatever you desire.

103
00:10:01,110 --> 00:10:02,040
The second rule,

104
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,060
when changing clothes, you must make sure you're not seen

105
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,960
and never undress in public.

106
00:10:05,980 --> 00:10:06,760
The third rule,

107
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:08,190
use chopsticks for eating,

108
00:10:08,190 --> 00:10:10,380
and spoons for soup and porridge.

109
00:10:21,230 --> 00:10:24,210
♫A pale moon through the screen, your face so bright♫

110
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:27,630

160
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:13,920
Mo Xiao.

161
00:14:11,080 --> 00:14:12,840
You can actually do it with your mind,

162
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:15,500
discarding all emotions, unmoved by anything.

163
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:18,520
You have a willpower that ordinary people can't match.

164
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,410
Very good.

165
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,270
What do you want?

166
00:14:21,790 --> 00:14:22,940
I can give it to you.

167
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:36,110
I want

168
00:14:36,640 --> 00:14:39,040
the antidote to the Love and Desire Poison.

169
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,820
To pass through my Crimson Abyss,

170
00:15:15,970 --> 00:15:17,670
only by remaining unmoved by the seven emotions

171
00:15:17,670 --> 00:15:19,670
can one successfully pass through.

172
00:16:07,670 --> 00:16:08,390
Father.

173
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:09,230
Dad.

174
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:11,070
Junior Yueyao has told you the plan?

175
00:16:11,070 --> 00:16:11,550
Yes,

176
00:16:11,580 --> 00:16:12,810
she told us everything.

177
00:16:12,810 --> 00:16:13,860
You little brat.

178
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,030
You didn't take the chance to do anything bad, did you?

179
00:16:16,030 --> 00:16:17,310
Am I really your biological child?

180
00:16:17,310 --> 00:16:18,740
You think of me like that, huh?

181
00:16:18,740 --> 00:16:19,690
Anyway, no matter what,

182
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,610
be careful.

183
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:22,020
Don't worry.

184
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:23,560
Father.

185
00:16:23,590 --> 00:16:25,730
The Demon Lord should be inside this Changhuan Palace.

186
00:16:25,730 --> 00:16:26,650
We've already obtained

187
00:16:26,650 --> 00:16:27,790
the token to enter Changhuan Palace.

188
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:28,590
That's right,

189
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:30,420
but we haven't found Mo Xiao yet.

190
00:16:30,980 --> 00:16:32,290
I see.

191
00:16:32,830 --> 00:16:33,670
Junior Xie.

192
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,360
These martial arts practitioners and fellow martial artists,

193
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,770
have been demonized.

194
00:16:37,820 --> 00:16:40,140
There's no way we can break through this barrier today.

195
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:42,130
Find a safe and hidden place first,

196
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:43,220
and settle them there.

197
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,540
I'll take these three

198
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:46,810
to find the Demon Lord and demand an antidote.

199
00:16:46,810 --> 00:16:48,030
My ancestral master!

200
00:16:48,060 --> 00:16:49,580
Then... then be careful, all of you.

201
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,160
I'll take care of things here.

202
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:50,690
Let's go.

203
00:16:51,190 --> 00:16:51,970
Lingyun.

204
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:52,940
Be careful.

205
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,210
Who are you?

206
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:12,830
Why are you back so late?

207
00:18:12,890 --> 00:18:14,570
I've missed you.

208
00:18:44,760 --> 00:18:46,880
Welcome to Changhuan Palace.

209
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:53,880
You must be Murong Changfeng.

210
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:55,320
Chongguang.

211
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:57,260
18 years ago,

212
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,790
you and Yeyuan,

213
00:18:58,820 --> 00:19:00,200
with your boundless ambition,

214
00:19:00,200 --> 00:19:03,040
attempted to seize the ancient divine artifact, the Millennium Token.

215
00:19:03,040 --> 00:19:05,640
The Sword Sovereign Fengyue of our Shushan Sect, stopped you.

216
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:08,340
Since then, the Heavenly Demon Sect has been lying low until now.

217
00:19:08,340 --> 00:19:11,100
Now you've kidnapped disciples from our immortal sects.

218
00:19:11,100 --> 00:19:12,830
What exactly are you planning?

219
00:19:16,700 --> 00:19:18,620
What do you intend to do with me?

220
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:22,040
If you don't change your ambitious ways,

221
00:19:22,430 --> 00:19:23,810
we disciples of the immortal sects

222
00:19:23,810 --> 00:19:26,310
will certainly uphold the Sword Sovereign's will

223
00:19:26,310 --> 00:19:28,640
and make sure to eradicate ambitious villains like you

224
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:29,870
completely.

225
00:19:32,270 --> 00:19:33,460
Go on.

226
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:35,370
If you now

227
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,240
are willing to mend your ways,

228
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,140
hand over the antidote for the Love and Desire Poison,

229
00:19:39,140 --> 00:19:40,600
and retreat to Mount Suyu,

230
00:19:41,240 --> 00:19:44,470
we disciples of the immortal sects will be lenient

231
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:46,620
and won't hunt you down to the last man.

232
00:19:48,210 --> 00:19:49,850
Are you threatening me?

233
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:58,000
But to threaten me, you need leverage.

234
00:19:58,870 --> 00:19:59,840
Do you have any?

235
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:03,560
You don't have it.

236
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:05,720
I do.

237
00:20:07,610 --> 00:20:09,100
Your Young Sect Leader

238
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:10,720
is still in my hands.

239
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:13,670
What have you done to Mo Xiao?

240
00:20:16,570 --> 00:20:17,360
Supreme Lord,

241
00:20:17,360 --> 00:20:18,660
Mo Xiao has found the antidote.

242
00:20:18,660 --> 00:20:21,790
All the Love and Desire Poison in the city has been cured.

243
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:24,430
Are you sure?

244
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,420
Mo Xiao!

245
00:20:32,870 --> 00:20:33,720
Are you alright?

246
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,780
Young Sect Leader.

247
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:36,030
Uncle Murong,

248
00:20:36,510 --> 00:20:38,180
you should leave Changhuan Palace first.

249
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,180
Leave this to me.

250
00:20:40,950 --> 00:20:41,790
Alright.

251
00:20:41,810 --> 00:20:43,220
Be careful.

252
00:20:44,220 --> 00:20:45,010
Let's go.

253
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:52,430
Feng Lixue.

254
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:01,370
Your poison has been cured.

255
00:21:05,560 --> 00:21:06,220
Jianchuan,

256
00:21:06,580 --> 00:21:07,380
you stay here.

257
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:09,450
Guard this place and assist the Young Sect Leader.

258
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,050
Yes.

259
00:21:10,460 --> 00:21:11,660
There are still some

260
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:13,810
demonized martial artists in the dungeon.

261
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:14,790
I'll lead a team there right away.

262
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,050
Alright, you go ahead.

263
00:21:16,950 --> 00:21:17,540
Ce.

264
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:18,510
Lingyun.

265
00:21:18,740 --> 00:21:20,780
Let's go to the courtyard and regroup with Jing and the others.

266
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,140
Let's make the necessary arrangements

267
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:23,400
and be ready to provide support at any time

268
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:24,580
for these martial artists

269
00:21:24,580 --> 00:21:26,420
who have been demonized and left the Love and Desire Valley.

270
00:21:26,420 --> 00:21:27,080
-Yes!
-Yes.

271
00:21:27,310 --> 00:21:27,840
Let's go.

272
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:35,120
As expected of the old man Fengyue's disciple.

273
00:21:35,690 --> 00:21:38,650
Such cultivation at such a young age.

274
00:21:39,310 --> 00:21:41,310
It makes me appreciate your talent.

275
00:21:42,260 --> 00:21:43,280
How about this?

276
00:21:44,020 --> 00:21:45,710
Why don't we join forces?

277
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:48,820
Just like Yeyuan and I did back then.

278
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,670
If we stand together,

279
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,460
not just in this mortal realm,

280
00:21:53,670 --> 00:21:55,640
but even dominating the three realms

281
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:57,100
would be within our reach.

282
00:21:57,470 --> 00:21:59,380
18 years ago, you and Demon Lord Yeyuan

283
00:21:59,380 --> 00:22:01,110
failed to obtain the Millennium Token.

284
00:22:01,110 --> 00:22:03,370
After that, you retreated to Mount Suyu.

285
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:05,340
I didn't expect that after 18 years,

286
00:22:05,340 --> 00:22:07,740
your ambition would remain undiminished.

287
00:22:08,910 --> 00:22:10,240
Is it not possible

288
00:22:10,380 --> 00:22:12,510
for a person to have some aspirations?

289
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:14,870
Are you sure you won't consider joining?

290
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,500
Exorcising demons and protecting the righteous path is my lifelong mission, Mo Xiao.

291
00:22:17,500 --> 00:22:18,960
It's engraved in my bones.

292
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:24,810
Perhaps one day you'll realize.

293
00:22:26,200 --> 00:22:27,800
I can rewrite your destiny.

294
00:22:28,710 --> 00:22:30,380
Your evil deeds are piled high.

295
00:22:30,380 --> 00:22:32,500
You will ultimately reap what you sow.

296
00:22:32,500 --> 00:22:36,140
They willingly let me control them.

297
00:22:37,250 --> 00:22:38,130
Just like

298
00:22:39,180 --> 00:22:40,440
Feng Lixue.

299
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:42,950
Next

300
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,100
and you too.

301
00:22:44,550 --> 00:22:46,550
Then I'll destroy your Demon Stone.

302
00:22:46,670 --> 00:22:47,700
Your life is mine.

303
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:56,410
Jing,

304
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:57,890
you were just poisoned earlier.

305
00:22:57,890 --> 00:22:59,130
The poison has been neutralized now.

306
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:00,060
You're fine now.

307
00:23:01,190 --> 00:23:02,230
Brother,

308
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,070
I haven't done anything

309
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,430
shameful, have I?

310
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:08,430
Of course not.

311
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:09,920
Jing,

312
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,170
you should ask me about this.

313
00:23:12,190 --> 00:23:14,120
I could tell you a whole basketful.

314
00:23:16,290 --> 00:23:17,150
Father,

315
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,860
I thought

316
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:22,560
I would never see you again.

317
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,780
Don't talk nonsense.

318
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:26,930
I'll be relieved that you're alright.

319
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:28,720
I'm fine.

320
00:23:30,970 --> 00:23:31,780
Ce,

321
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,160
quickly use Fengyu Soundlink

322
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,250
to report the situation here back to Shushan Sect.

323
00:23:35,250 --> 00:23:37,110
Let the Sect Leader be at ease too.

324
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,130
Yes, father.

325
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:40,540
Where are the three Great Guardians?

326
00:23:46,530 --> 00:23:48,060
Greetings, Branch Leader.

327
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,900
What happened to Zisu?

328
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,000
She...

329
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:54,250
Don't just stand there, you two.

330
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:55,580
Go check on her quickly.

331
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,620
-Yes.
-Yes.

332
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:31,020
Mo Xiao!

333
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,690
Lixue.

334
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:57,450
You've already saved the person you wanted to save.

335
00:25:57,450 --> 00:25:58,780
Aren't you leaving yet?

336
00:26:17,470 --> 00:26:18,870
The person I want to save,

337
00:26:19,380 --> 00:26:20,710
there's still one more.

338
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,760
Lixue,

339
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:23,900
come with me.

340
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,950
We'll meet again.

341
00:26:34,030 --> 00:26:35,560
What if I say I'm not leaving?

342
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:36,380
Lixue, have you forgotten

343
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,860
when we climbed to the peak of Snow Peak,

344
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:38,980
the vision we saw?

345
00:26:45,880 --> 00:26:47,200
As for avenging my father,

346
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:48,570
I will investigate it myself.

347
00:26:48,570 --> 00:26:50,330
You should quickly leave with your fellow disciples.

348
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:51,910
Master is an unruly person.

349
00:26:51,930 --> 00:26:53,260
You've destroyed his Love and Desire Valley.

350
00:26:53,260 --> 00:26:54,320
He won't let it go easily.

351
00:26:54,320 --> 00:26:54,840
Lixue,

352
00:26:54,950 --> 00:26:57,300
I will definitely uncover the truth about this matter.

353
00:26:57,300 --> 00:26:58,430
-Trust me.
-No need.

354
00:26:58,510 --> 00:27:01,040
Avenging my father has nothing to do with you.

355
00:27:02,770 --> 00:27:03,450
Lixue.

356
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:09,300
Do we really have to do this?

357
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:19,610
You are the emotionless sword immortal of the Shushan Sect.

358
00:27:19,610 --> 00:27:22,140
I am the corrupted Star Lord of the Demon Sect.

359
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,750
Between us,

360
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,710
there is no other choice.

361
00:27:27,540 --> 00:27:29,120
Emotionless.

362
00:27:31,960 --> 00:27:33,000
I originally

363
00:27:35,100 --> 00:27:36,280
believed you.

364
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,430
But later I found out

365
00:27:40,010 --> 00:27:41,570
it was all a lie.

366
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,560
You deceived me again.

367
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:47,630
I truly haven't been bewitched by the Love and Desire Poison.

368
00:27:47,630 --> 00:27:49,360
But precisely because of this,

369
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:52,830
every word I've said to you comes from my heart.

370
00:27:53,970 --> 00:27:56,150
If it weren't for the guise of the Love and Desire Poison,

371
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:59,010
as the Young Sect Leader of the Shushan Sect, these words

372
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,010
I fear I would never be able to utter.

373
00:28:03,610 --> 00:28:05,340
I belong to the immortal sects,

374
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,060
where the great Way comes first.

375
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:10,210
I have no choice.

376
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:16,790
But my only true feelings

377
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:20,310
have fallen into the Crimson Abyss.

378
00:28:31,090 --> 00:28:31,910
Lixue.

379
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,780
Zisu.

380
00:29:52,460 --> 00:29:53,740
The three of us

381
00:29:53,760 --> 00:29:56,220
grew up together with the Young Sect Leader.

382
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:59,410
As to what are you thinking in your heart,

383
00:29:59,410 --> 00:30:00,540
others may not know,

384
00:30:01,030 --> 00:30:03,090
but I understand better than anyone.

385
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,170
Actually,

386
00:30:05,270 --> 00:30:07,720
you've always been in love with the Young Sect Leader.

387
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:10,650
However, due to sect rules, you couldn't express it.

388
00:30:11,000 --> 00:30:13,700
This time, affected by the Love and Desire Poison,

389
00:30:13,700 --> 00:30:16,280
you finally dared to reveal your true feelings, right?

390
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:17,080
This time,

391
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,810
I've made such a big mistake.

392
00:30:18,840 --> 00:30:19,560
Do you think

393
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:22,820
the Young Sect Leader will expel me from Tiance Villa?

394
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,820
Silly girl,

395
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,680
there's no right or wrong in liking someone.

396
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:31,170
The Young Sect Leader is exceptionally talented.

397
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,050
In this world,

398
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:34,700
which woman wouldn't like such a man?

399
00:30:35,140 --> 00:30:35,940
Moreover,

400
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:38,430
you two spend time together day and night.

401
00:30:38,610 --> 00:30:41,540
It's understandable to develop feelings over time.

402
00:30:41,770 --> 00:30:42,660
Zifeng,

403
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:45,660
could it be that you also like the Young Sect Leader?

404
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:48,230
My affection for the Young Sect Leader

405
00:30:48,670 --> 00:30:50,920
has long transcended romantic love.

406
00:30:51,170 --> 00:30:52,250
The Young Sect Leader

407
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:54,280
is the future leader of Shushan Sect,

408
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:56,010
a leader among immortal sects.

409
00:30:56,400 --> 00:30:59,200
He is the person I want to follow for my entire life.

410
00:31:00,060 --> 00:31:01,880
What I want to do in this life

411
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:04,790
is to help him achieve merit for the immortal sects.

412
00:31:04,790 --> 00:31:05,800
This

413
00:31:05,820 --> 00:31:07,640
is enough for me to dedicate my entire life

414
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,900
to strive and improve.

415
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:10,950
Like this,

416
00:31:11,070 --> 00:31:12,990
what else could be unsatisfying?

417
00:31:15,280 --> 00:31:17,210
We've cultivated together since childhood.

418
00:31:17,210 --> 00:31:19,100
Why is it that you understand everything

419
00:31:19,100 --> 00:31:20,620
more thoroughly than I do?

420
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:23,710
I come from the Fengyu Branch.

421
00:31:23,740 --> 00:31:26,640
I helped the Young Sect Leader understand all matters under heaven.

422
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:28,640
I naturally have heard and seen more.

423
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,770
So,

424
00:31:30,370 --> 00:31:31,660
some things,

425
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:34,070
I've already seen through.

426
00:31:34,130 --> 00:31:35,260
Then, will the Young Sect Leader

427
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:36,660
really not drive me away?

428
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:40,500
The Young Sect Leader's cultivation is far above yours and mine.

429
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:43,030
How could he blame you for such a small matter?

430
00:31:44,970 --> 00:31:45,770
However,

431
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:47,420
Zisu,

432
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:52,000
the Young Sect Leader's path of cultivation is long and endless.

433
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:54,880
It's already a blessing that we can accompany him.

434
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:56,310
Some things

435
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,650
will eventually change with time.

436
00:32:00,300 --> 00:32:01,190
So,

437
00:32:01,400 --> 00:32:02,800
what you need to overcome

438
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:04,730
is the hurdle in your own heart.

439
00:32:05,470 --> 00:32:06,530
Do you understand?

440
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,220
I understand.

441
00:32:11,650 --> 00:32:12,750
Zisu, come back quickly!

442
00:32:12,750 --> 00:32:14,610
The Young Sect Leader is injured.

443
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:23,260
Young Sect Leader.

444
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:27,300
Young Sect Leader.

445
00:32:29,500 --> 00:32:31,080
How did you get so badly injured?

446
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:32,400
It's all our fault.

447
00:32:32,420 --> 00:32:33,980
We failed to protect you.

448
00:32:36,060 --> 00:32:36,940
It's nothing.

449
00:32:37,540 --> 00:32:39,190
Just some superficial wounds.

450
00:32:39,190 --> 00:32:40,490
Some ointment will do.

451
00:32:44,260 --> 00:32:45,390
You three, please leave.

452
00:32:45,390 --> 00:32:46,680
I need to speak with Mo Xiao.

453
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,400
Yes.

454
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,910
Alright, sit down.

455
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:51,550
Uncle Master.

456
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:52,290
Sit down.

457
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:53,780
You may go.

458
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:02,910
Feng Lixue has also escaped with Chongguang?

459
00:33:03,240 --> 00:33:03,990
Yes.

460
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:09,840
Before I came here,

461
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:11,610
the Sect Leader repeatedly instructed me

462
00:33:11,610 --> 00:33:12,610
that if I see you,

463
00:33:12,750 --> 00:33:13,910
I must tell you

464
00:33:13,930 --> 00:33:16,150
to kill Feng Lixue without fail when you see her.

465
00:33:16,150 --> 00:33:17,950
But you always refuse to do it.

466
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,920
You are clearly capable of doing it.

467
00:33:24,050 --> 00:33:24,960
Uncle Master,

468
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:29,350
Feng Lixue misunderstood because of what Feng Xingtian did

469
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,200
to harm the Sword Sovereign years ago.

470
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:34,800
Therefore,

471
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:38,970
she blamed me and the Shushan Sect for her father's death.

472
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,120
That's why she was later exploited by Chongguang

473
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,840
and fell into the path of evil.

474
00:33:43,220 --> 00:33:44,920
But she wasn't originally evil.

475
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,620
She's trapped in the demon's lair because she doesn't know the truth.

476
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:50,300
She is also a pitiful person.

477
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,880
Although that may be true,

478
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:54,510
but the Sect Leader...

479
00:33:57,150 --> 00:33:59,360
Come to think of it, it's really strange.

480
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:02,390
The Sect Leader is usually kind-hearted,

481
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:03,720
but when it comes to Feng Lixue,

482
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:05,580
he insists that you must kill her.

483
00:34:05,870 --> 00:34:07,730
What could be the reason for this?

484
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:09,949
Perhaps Master

485
00:34:10,620 --> 00:34:13,000
harbors resentment because of Feng Xingtian's

486
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:14,659
duel with the Sword Sovereign

487
00:34:14,719 --> 00:34:17,130
and the Sword Sovereign's subsequent seclusion,

488
00:34:17,130 --> 00:34:19,060
so he's taking it out on Feng Lixue.

489
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,120
Alright.

490
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:28,219
Since things have come to this point,

491
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:30,699
when you next see the Sect Leader,

492
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:35,670
you should explain the situation to him yourself.

493
00:34:38,190 --> 00:34:39,850
Take good care of your wounds.

494
00:34:43,210 --> 00:34:43,850
Master,

495
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,489
I know you want me to kill Lixue

496
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,639
because of the talk of a fatal destiny,

497
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,290
but Lixue fell off the cliff years ago because of my mistake.

498
00:34:52,340 --> 00:34:54,270
Ten years later, when we met again,

499
00:34:54,270 --> 00:34:56,940
Lixue even saved my life in a critical moment.

500
00:34:58,350 --> 00:35:01,690
This time, when I went to the Crimson Abyss to find the antidote,

501
00:35:01,690 --> 00:35:03,420
it was also Lixue who helped me.

502
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:06,760
If there really is such a thing as a fatal destiny,

503
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,360
I seem more likely to be Lixue's fatal destiny.

504
00:35:10,080 --> 00:35:11,400
How could I

505
00:35:11,760 --> 00:35:15,160
bring myself to kill Lixue, who has helped me multiple times?

506
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,780
Master and the Sword Sovereign have both taught me to care for all living beings.

507
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:22,240
How could I, out of concern for my own safety,

508
00:35:22,790 --> 00:35:24,510
harm an innocent life?

509
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,710
Supreme Lord.

510
00:35:48,850 --> 00:35:50,780
Star Lord of Shaohao has returned.

511
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,430
Supreme Lord.

512
00:35:56,690 --> 00:35:59,090
Star Lord of Shaohao requests an audience.

513
00:36:20,090 --> 00:36:21,530
Who let you in?

514
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:22,960
Supreme Lord.

515
00:36:23,060 --> 00:36:25,460
Star Lord of Shaohao requests an audience.

516
00:36:26,110 --> 00:36:27,100
Where is he?

517
00:36:27,380 --> 00:36:28,540
In the front hall.

518
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:32,190
Without my orders,

519
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,810
you are not allowed to enter in the future.

520
00:36:56,440 --> 00:36:57,640
I have made a mistake.

521
00:36:57,670 --> 00:36:59,130
Please punish me, Master.

522
00:36:59,610 --> 00:37:00,860
Where is the fault?

523
00:37:01,370 --> 00:37:02,590
I have not noticed it.

524
00:37:02,610 --> 00:37:04,170
Mo Xiao pretended to be poisoned.

525
00:37:04,170 --> 00:37:05,530
I fell for the treacherous plot.

526
00:37:05,530 --> 00:37:07,130
I accidentally revealed the antidote for the Love and Desire Poison

527
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,570
was at the Crimson Abyss.

528
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:10,420
Please punish me, Master.

529
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,000
Lixue,

530
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:16,440
you are my

531
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:19,200
only disciple.

532
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,480
I saved you ten years ago.

533
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:24,550
and made you my disciple.

534
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,040
Do you know why?

535
00:37:26,560 --> 00:37:27,480
I do not know.

536
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:31,100
Because you have hatred in your heart.

537
00:37:31,120 --> 00:37:32,120
Ruthless enough.

538
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,040
You have been lying low for ten years,

539
00:37:34,040 --> 00:37:35,320
waiting for the opportunity to take revenge.

540
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,450
Patient enough, persevering enough.

541
00:37:38,240 --> 00:37:41,900
You surpass countless weak and incompetent people in this world.

542
00:37:43,010 --> 00:37:44,210
Only such a person

543
00:37:44,570 --> 00:37:47,650
will you be worthy of being my disciple.

544
00:37:54,750 --> 00:37:56,310
But now you

545
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:57,880
have changed.

546
00:37:59,360 --> 00:38:01,320
Your forbearance has turned to weakness,

547
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:02,620
and your resolve

548
00:38:03,120 --> 00:38:04,160
to hesitation.

549
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:06,440
Are you still the Feng Lixue

550
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:08,880
I saved ten years ago?

551
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:11,020
In these ten years, I've never asked,

552
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:12,230
Master,

553
00:38:12,920 --> 00:38:15,410
how did you know I fell off the cliff

554
00:38:15,650 --> 00:38:17,230
and rescued me back then?

555
00:38:20,300 --> 00:38:23,030
Were you also at the peak of Snow Peak at that time?

556
00:38:28,330 --> 00:38:29,330
Perhaps

557
00:38:30,010 --> 00:38:31,210
this is

558
00:38:31,700 --> 00:38:33,640
the destined fate between us.

559
00:38:33,670 --> 00:38:36,730
Then why didn't you save my father at that time, Master?

560
00:38:39,130 --> 00:38:40,780
Are you blaming me?

561
00:38:43,570 --> 00:38:44,640
I wouldn't dare,

562
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:47,770
it's just that if you had saved my father back then,

563
00:38:48,260 --> 00:38:49,830
perhaps I would

564
00:38:50,650 --> 00:38:52,050
suffer a little less now.

565
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,360
Your father

566
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,800
initially attacked Shushan Sect

567
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,510
just to save you.

568
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,460
If he knew

569
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,260
that I had already saved you,

570
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:06,540
he should have died without regrets.

571
00:39:06,780 --> 00:39:07,380
Yes,

572
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:10,640
Master, you're right.

573
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,600
But if

574
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:15,640
he knew

575
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,320
that his daughter's

576
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:22,430
desire for revenge

577
00:39:23,490 --> 00:39:24,850
has already wavered.

578
00:39:25,360 --> 00:39:26,200
I wonder

579
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:30,710
how he would feel as a wandering soul beneath Fengdu City.

580
00:39:31,010 --> 00:39:32,270
The desire for revenge

581
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,400
has never wavered.

582
00:39:35,630 --> 00:39:37,790
Then, has your loyalty to me

583
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,310
wavered?

584
00:39:55,710 --> 00:39:58,350
I, Feng Lixue, am clear about gratitude and grudges.

585
00:39:58,350 --> 00:40:00,150
This life is for two things only:

586
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,420
First,

587
00:40:01,890 --> 00:40:03,490
to avenge my father's death.

588
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:04,870
Second,

589
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,000
to repay the debt of saving my life.

590
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,330
Master, you have shown me great kindness.

591
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:10,680
My life

592
00:40:11,090 --> 00:40:12,420
belongs to you, Master.

593
00:40:21,860 --> 00:40:23,310
What about your heart?

594
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:27,760
Let's

595
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:30,500
ask your heart.

596
00:40:40,850 --> 00:40:41,810
Lixue,

597
00:40:48,030 --> 00:40:49,500
come with me.

598
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,370
Come.

599
00:41:30,940 --> 00:41:32,440
Let's see

600
00:41:32,770 --> 00:41:35,090
the person you're thinking of.

601
00:41:46,390 --> 00:41:47,430
Mo Xiao.

602
00:41:48,280 --> 00:41:48,970
Lixue.

603
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:54,290
Mo Xiao.

604
00:41:54,490 --> 00:41:55,750
Don't come any closer.

605
00:41:56,060 --> 00:41:56,990
Go away.

606
00:41:58,430 --> 00:41:59,760
Stay back.

607
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:00,990
Leave.

608
00:42:03,580 --> 00:42:04,580
Go.

609
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,670
Mo Xiao.

610
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:12,560
Don't come any closer.

611
00:42:12,900 --> 00:42:13,700
No, Mo Xiao.

612
00:42:13,780 --> 00:42:14,830
Stay away.

613
00:42:15,170 --> 00:42:16,320
Mo Xiao.

614
00:42:16,530 --> 00:42:18,590
Go away, Mo Xiao, just go!
