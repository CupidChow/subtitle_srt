1
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,690
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:38,710
(Episode 12)

3
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:43,380
Just checking her condition.

4
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:45,310
Why do we have to be kicked out?

5
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,560
The Young Sect Leader said

6
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,400
it's not good to disturb the Divine Healer

7
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:48,280
while he's checking her condition.

8
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:50,000
What are you complaining about?

9
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:51,360
Even I was kicked out.

10
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,640
What do you mean?

11
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:54,800
Are you someone special?

12
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,680
I'm the one who brought the Divine Healer here.

13
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,400
What kind of weird old man have you brought?

14
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,560
Looks like you've met your match.

15
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,560
What is Mo Xiao up to?

16
00:02:09,669 --> 00:02:10,509
Divine Healer.

17
00:02:10,919 --> 00:02:11,720
You can start now.

18
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,720
Well, I don't mind people being around

19
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,940
when I'm treating.

20
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:18,120
But it's better to send them out first.

21
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:19,800
Just prepare some wine for me.

22
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:30,380
Did you figure out what illness it is?

23
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,240
This young lady has an innate condition of extreme cold in her body.

24
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,510
No one can cure it.

25
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,630
Why did you specifically come to me, then?

26
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:39,260
Her cold condition is indeed difficult to cure.

27
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:40,550
But if I want to save her life,

28
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,320
only you can do it in this world.

29
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:42,880
Isn't that right?

30
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:44,079
I don't want that peach blossom wine.

31
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:46,040
You saved her life back then.

32
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:47,560
Are you going to ignore her now?

33
00:02:52,880 --> 00:02:54,610
So, that day when you disappeared suddenly,

34
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,210
you went looking for the Divine Healer.

35
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,079
What else could I do?

36
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,600
Did you think I got cold feet?

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,120
You were gone for three days without a word.

38
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,160
I thought you had been kidnapped by those evil forces.

39
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:04,940
What?

40
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,440
You started to worry about me?

41
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,000
I was just worried

42
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:10,440
that

43
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,450
if the Phoenix-masked Woman shows up suddenly,

44
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:13,740
we naturally have one less helper

45
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,040
without you.

46
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,690
So you were just worried that no one would protect you.

47
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:20,079
I don't need your protection.

48
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:23,280
I was worried about Miss Wu Chen and Mo Xiao.

49
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:27,640
Of course.

50
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:29,329
Who could compare to your beloved

51
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:30,760
Mo Xiao?

52
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,120
Alright.

53
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:35,920
You're pretty good to.

54
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:38,650
To have found Shi Bujiu so quickly

55
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:39,720
and returned in time.

56
00:03:41,520 --> 00:03:43,000
How did you do that?

57
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:45,110
Did you forget?

58
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:46,640
I had arranged to meet him before we came.

59
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:48,240
We agreed to meet at Peach Blossom Village in half a month.

60
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,520
I figured since we had a prior arrangement,

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:51,680
he should be nearby.

62
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:53,150
So I went to look for him,

63
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:54,360
and I found him.

64
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:57,170
However,

65
00:03:57,440 --> 00:03:58,680
it's strange.

66
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:01,360
Our Uncle Master Xuan Zhen

67
00:04:01,600 --> 00:04:02,960
is also a master of medicine.

68
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:04,120
Why didn't Mo Xiao

69
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,600
look for him

70
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:08,800
and instead had you prepare the peach blossom wine

71
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,720
and look for

72
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:11,520
this elusive old man,

73
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,480
Shi Bujiu?

74
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:15,440
Mo Xiao is always very calculated in his actions.

75
00:04:15,960 --> 00:04:18,120
He must have his reasons for doing this.

76
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:27,240
You knew that Feng Xingtian had come to me?

77
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,560
When Feng Lixue was born,

78
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,840
the cold aura was so severe

79
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,000
and she almost died in infancy.

80
00:04:32,750 --> 00:04:33,880
Feng Xingtian came to find you.

81
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:36,360
Although you couldn't cure the cold condition in her body,

82
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,200
you gave her an Ice silkworm cocoon

83
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:39,560
to protect herself from the cold aura.

84
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:42,360
This allowed her to be close to others,

85
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,440
to be fed,

86
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:44,680
and to grow up.

87
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:47,950
But if you knew I couldn't cure it,

88
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:49,800
why did you come to me again?

89
00:04:53,980 --> 00:04:54,810
Divine Healer.

90
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:57,040
I invited you here

91
00:04:57,630 --> 00:04:58,590
not just to treat her illness.

92
00:04:59,080 --> 00:04:59,720
I wanted

93
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:02,440
to confirm something as well.

94
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:04,590
What do you want to confirm?

95
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:06,590
That young lady.

96
00:05:07,540 --> 00:05:10,190
Is she the infant you saved years ago?

97
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:11,680
Is she Feng Lixue?

98
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,660
I've treated

99
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:22,000
countless people in my life,

100
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:23,460
and never failed.

101
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:25,280
Only for

102
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
her extraordinarily cold condition,

103
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:28,320
I was powerless to help.

104
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:32,360
I'm ashamed to mention it to the world.

105
00:05:33,640 --> 00:05:34,360
At that time,

106
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:35,480
that infant

107
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,960
had unusual blood and meridians.

108
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:40,200
I will never forget it in my lifetime.

109
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:41,280
She

110
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:46,300
is undoubtedly Feng Lixue.

111
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,350
I'm Feng Lixue.

112
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,320
Then, Mo Xiao,

113
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:56,840
how exactly will you take me up the mountain?

114
00:05:57,250 --> 00:05:59,610
I was born with a body of extreme cold.

115
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:01,690
No one could get close to me.

116
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:09,570
The white ice silkworm's cocoon is extremely cold.

117
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,720
It doesn't get wet in water, nor does it burn in fire.

118
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:17,920
Divine Healer, your appointment at Peach Blossom Village this time,

119
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:20,480
is also about the Tianxing Secret Treasury?

120
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:32,159
Ten years ago,

121
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,940
I learned that Feng Xingtian and his daughter

122
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,720
had both fallen off a cliff and died.

123
00:06:37,159 --> 00:06:40,040
My precious Ice silkworm cocoon

124
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:41,800
disappeared without a trace.

125
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:43,640
I thought

126
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:44,880
perhaps that treasure

127
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:47,480
had been collected into the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

128
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:50,840
As the infant grows into an adult, the effect of Ice silkworm cocoon

129
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,550
has diminished.

130
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:53,840
But I

131
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:56,040
still want to find that treasure.

132
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,159
Haven't you ever considered thinking about

133
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,120
why the daughter of Feng Xingtian

134
00:07:00,640 --> 00:07:02,040
would come back to life?

135
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,760
There are as many extraordinary people in this world.

136
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,200
If she can come back from the dead,

137
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:09,760
then it's her fate.

138
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:11,120
What does it have to do with me?

139
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:13,270
Mo Xiao,

140
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:14,960
you don't think

141
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:16,840
this is somehow connected to me, do you?

142
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,480
Other than you,

143
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:21,300
I can't think of anyone else in this world

144
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:24,080
who has such incredible power.

145
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,840
Mo Xiao.

146
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,830
You know

147
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,400
I only focus on treating patients.

148
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,840
I've never been involved in

149
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,720
matters of the martial world.

150
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,400
Please don't be hasty, Divine Healer.

151
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:37,800
I just have some doubts,

152
00:07:37,920 --> 00:07:39,280
and hope you could give me some guidance.

153
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:43,000
As for the Tianxing Secret Treasury,

154
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:44,040
there are many rumors floating around.

155
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:45,000
So,

156
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:47,200
regarding the fact that Miss Wu Chen is Feng Lixue,

157
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:49,200
I hope you won't spread it around.

158
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,520
I haven't even mentioned you yet.

159
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,370
You're bringing up all sorts of nonsense

160
00:07:55,760 --> 00:07:57,440
and now you're trying to restrict me.

161
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,120
You're a free spirit, a recluse beyond worldly affairs.

162
00:08:01,960 --> 00:08:03,080
It was thoughtless of me.

163
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,640
A jar of fine wine, please.

164
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,480
Let it go.

165
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:10,400
The world is ever-changing,

166
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:11,760
and how is that my concern?

167
00:08:13,880 --> 00:08:14,800
Prepare the wine for me.

168
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,720
I'm going to start working on the prescription.

169
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,090
After 10 years of diligent practice,

170
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,570
I must understand this cold syndrome this time,

171
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:26,400
and redeem my past failure.

172
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,260
The first step

173
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:38,150
is to infuse the blood and energy of a person with great cultivation

174
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,679
into her body,

175
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:43,750
to protect her heart veins from the cold poison.

176
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,600
The second step

177
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:26,600
is to use a thousand-year-old snow lotus in the medicine.

178
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
The cold aura in her body is too strong.

179
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:32,930
Only the thousand-year-old snow lotus

180
00:09:33,280 --> 00:09:35,390
can help concentrate and control the cold aura inside her.

181
00:09:35,480 --> 00:09:36,760
The thousand-year-old snow lotus?

182
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:37,450
Yes.

183
00:09:37,480 --> 00:09:39,710
Isn't that a spiritual herb that grows in the desolate snowy mountain?

184
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,460
It's not easy to find at all.

185
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:42,080
I'll go.

186
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:43,180
You can't go.

187
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:44,520
You just transferred your spiritual power to Wu Chen.

188
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,520
Your body is so weak.

189
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:46,800
How can you go to such an extremely cold place?

190
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,520
I'll go.

191
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:49,640
Then I'll go too.

192
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:51,960
We'll go together.

193
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,560
That thousand-year-old snow lotus

194
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,240
possesses divine spiritual energy.

195
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,760
It roams the snow regions and its location is unpredictable.

196
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:01,680
If too many people go there,

197
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,520
I'm afraid it might startle the snow lotus

198
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,840
and it won't reveal itself.

199
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:06,760
I'll go alone.

you must have a new answer.

337
00:14:35,070 --> 00:14:36,410
You should at least let me know

338
00:14:36,440 --> 00:14:37,240
why you're going to such lengths

339
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,480
for her.

340
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:48,910
Mo Xiao,

341
00:14:55,370 --> 00:14:57,120
don't tell me you've really fallen for her.

342
00:14:58,360 --> 00:14:59,920
You're the Young Sect Leader of the Shushan Sect,

343
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:02,200
the only successor of the Sword Sovereign Fengyue.

344
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:04,400
You're different from us.

345
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:06,960
If you've truly developed feelings for her,

346
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,750
what about the future of Shushan?

347
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,150
As a brother,

348
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:14,480
I really don't want to see you

349
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:15,860
ruin your bright future.

350
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:17,440
Lingyun.

351
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:19,650
Do you know why I asked you

352
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,840
to invite the Divine Healer Shi Bujiu?

353
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,020
I do.

354
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,880
To cure the cold poison in Wu Chen's body.

355
00:15:26,740 --> 00:15:28,200
Wu Chen was born with this cold condition.

356
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:29,800
No one can cure it.

357
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:31,080
Actually,

358
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:33,320
it's not caused by the snow demon from the snow realm.

359
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:39,320
Then why did you ask me to...

360
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:44,000
Could she really be

361
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:46,640
Feng Lixue?

362
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,770
Then who is the Phoenix-masked Woman?

363
00:15:59,770 --> 00:16:02,040
That's exactly the question I can't figure out.

364
00:17:10,609 --> 00:17:12,050
This snow lotus elixir

365
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:14,220
is repelled by the cold aura in Wu Chen's body.

366
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,390
It can't be infused into her body.

367
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,400
I want revenge!

368
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,280
Lixue!

369
00:20:26,040 --> 00:20:26,520
Lixue.

370
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:28,000
Lixue!

371
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,480
What's wrong with you?

372
00:20:33,000 --> 00:20:33,960
Did you have a nightmare?

373
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:37,480
You're awake.

374
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,960
You just called out for Lixue.

375
00:20:42,680 --> 00:20:43,760
Who is she?

376
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:47,200
She is the daughter

377
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,800
of the Heavenly Order Sect Leader, Feng Xingtian.

378
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:52,840
Phoenix-masked Woman.

379
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,880
Does she look like me?

380
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,440
Why

381
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,080
do you ask that?

382
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:02,280
Because

383
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,280
when I was in Shushan,

384
00:21:05,680 --> 00:21:07,880
your Master locked me into the Demon Subduing Palace

385
00:21:07,920 --> 00:21:09,160
and mentioned this name.

386
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:12,840
I've been hearing this name more and more lately.

387
00:21:14,120 --> 00:21:15,840
Do I have any connection to her?

388
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:35,480
What are you thinking about?

389
00:21:36,610 --> 00:21:39,320
(Peach Blossom Villa)

390
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,840
Zifeng.
(Peach Blossom Villa)

391
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:40,800
(Peach Blossom Villa)

392
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,240
Do you remember what the Sect Leader said back then
(Peach Blossom Villa)

393
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:43,600
when he selected the three of us from the Fengyu Branch,

394
00:21:44,120 --> 00:21:44,920
Tielyv Branch,

395
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:46,720
and Baicao Branch

396
00:21:46,800 --> 00:21:47,970
to be the

397
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,720
Guardian

398
00:21:50,200 --> 00:21:51,200
of the Young Sect Leader?

399
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,460
As Guardian,

400
00:21:53,560 --> 00:21:55,520
we are to help the Young Sect Leader avert disasters,

401
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:56,560
enhance his achievements,

402
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,120
honor the righteous path,

403
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,240
subdue demonic hearts,

404
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,720
guard the Young Sect Leader,

405
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,160
and defend the righteous path of the Shushan Sect.

406
00:22:04,120 --> 00:22:04,790
That's correct.

407
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:07,080
That's our duty.

408
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:08,640
But

409
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:10,320
why are you asking this all of a sudden?

410
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,920
Are you feeling guilty because the Young Sect Leader

411
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,040
encountered difficulties after leaving Shushan?

412
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:18,880
Do you blame us for not protecting him well?

413
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:25,360
If the Young Sect Leader is tempted by the demonic heart,

414
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,560
should we help him subdue those evil thoughts?

415
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:30,230
What?

416
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,200
Don't talk nonsense!

417
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,560
I hope I'm just talking nonsense.

418
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:44,210
You've always taken the guardian duties most seriously since childhood.

419
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,560
Actually,

420
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,640
you don't need to put so much pressure on yourself.

421
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,080
Zimu and I are here too.

422
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:35,960
Zisu.

423
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:38,330
Did Mo Xiao send you to find me?

424
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:39,720
You've been hiding your identity

425
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,080
and staying close to the Young Sect Leader.

426
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
What exactly is your purpose?

427
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,040
Hiding my identity?

428
00:23:44,680 --> 00:23:45,680
What identity?

429
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:47,520
The daughter of the Tianxing Sect leader,

430
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:49,280
Feng Lixue.

431
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:51,520
You're also saying I'm Feng Lixue?

432
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:52,880
Are you going to deny it?

433
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:55,880
I'm not denying it,

434
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:58,080
I just don't understand

435
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,840
why you all say I'm Feng Lixue,

436
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:03,040
but I have no memory of it myself.

437
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,720
You really don't know?

438
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:07,920
I don't know who I am.

439
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:09,640
It's ridiculous, isn't it?

440
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:11,120
Wu Chen.

441
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:14,040
I brought your favorite glutinous rice balls.

442
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,350
No matter who you are,

443
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,040
you'd better disappear on your own soon.

444
00:24:19,160 --> 00:24:19,800
Young Master Jing.

445
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:25,200
What's wrong with Zisu?

446
00:24:26,600 --> 00:24:28,560
She looks unhappy.

447
00:24:29,640 --> 00:24:31,160
She's worried about me.

448
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:32,680
Worried about you?

449
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:34,640
But your cold syndrome has been

450
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:35,720
cured by the Divine Healer

451
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:36,560
Mo Xiao brought.

452
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:37,960
What is there to worry about?

453
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:51,520
Wu Chen,

454
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:53,400
you've made progress with your Ice Technique.

455
00:24:53,480 --> 00:24:54,080
No,

456
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:55,960
I still haven't fully mastered it.

457
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,320
You've just recovered,

458
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,960
there's no need to rush practicing the Ice Technique.

459
00:25:02,480 --> 00:25:02,960
No,

460
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,280
I still need to practice hard.

461
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:07,330
What's wrong?

462
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,540
Is it because so much has happened recently

463
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:10,680
and it scared you?

464
00:25:11,160 --> 00:25:11,960
Don't worry,

465
00:25:12,040 --> 00:25:12,800
we're here.

466
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:14,080
We won't let anything happen to you.

467
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,000
No,

468
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,840
I can't rely on you guys forever.

469
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:21,280
I have my own matters to take care of.

470
00:25:22,160 --> 00:25:23,120
What matters?

471
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:24,840
Important matters.

472
00:25:34,280 --> 00:25:34,760
Supreme Lord.

473
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,160
Mo Xiao

474
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:38,000
seems to have confirmed Wu Chen's identity.

475
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:42,960
Just based on Shi Bujiu's words?

476
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:44,800
No,

477
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:48,480
that will only make him more confused.

478
00:25:49,680 --> 00:25:51,250
If he wants to find the answer,

479
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,720
he must go to Tongming Island.

480
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:54,640
However, Supreme Lord.

481
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:56,360
Wu Chen is starting to question

482
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:57,920
her background.

483
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:05,840
Since she has left Mang Mountain,

484
00:26:07,050 --> 00:26:08,250
there are some questions

485
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,160
she must learn

486
00:26:10,280 --> 00:26:11,600
to face on her own.

487
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:21,100
Great Guardian.

488
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,800
Will the Young Miss really appear here?

489
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:24,680
The Young Miss summoned us

490
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:25,760
with the Phoenix Feather Order.

491
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:27,600
So she'll certainly keep her word.

492
00:26:27,620 --> 00:26:29,000
Those people are already eager

493
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,880
to head into the Myriad Isles Ice Lake to find Tongming Island.

494
00:26:31,240 --> 00:26:32,760
I wonder when the Young Miss will open the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

495
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:35,240
The Young Miss surely has her own plans.

496
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:37,400
We

497
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:39,160
just need to do what we are supposed to.

498
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,260
Young Miss.

499
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,560
You haven't shown yourself for several days now.

500
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,320
I don't know what to do.

501
00:26:50,440 --> 00:26:51,520
Please give me your instructions, Young Miss.

502
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:57,530
Three days later,

503
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:58,760
Tongming Island will appear.

504
00:26:59,350 --> 00:27:00,220
Young Miss,

505
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:02,040
do you really intend to open the Tianxing Secret Treasury?

506
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,680
I'll follow your every command.

507
00:27:07,800 --> 00:27:09,640
Then do what you're supposed to do.

508
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,240
Don't ask things

509
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:13,080
you shouldn't ask.

510
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:20,150
Great Guardian.

511
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,390
The Tianxing Secret Treasury

512
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:23,250
contains the treasures Master spent his whole life to find.

513
00:27:23,720 --> 00:27:24,430
Does Young Miss

514
00:27:24,450 --> 00:27:25,940
really want to reveal everything

515
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,840
and distribute all the rare treasures from the Treasury?

516
00:27:28,670 --> 00:27:29,360
Indeed,

517
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:31,480
these are the fruits of our Master's lifelong efforts.

518
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:32,880
It's truly a pity

519
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:34,120
to give them away so easily.

520
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,320
The Young Miss is now the owner of the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

521
00:27:39,640 --> 00:27:40,480
We'll follow

522
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,000
whatever she says.

523
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,750
But Great Guardian,

524
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,640
that day at the entrance of the Myriad Isles Ice Lake,

525
00:27:44,660 --> 00:27:45,680
you saw it too.

526
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:47,510
The girl named Wu Chen beside Mo Xiao.

527
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
The cold aura she released was enough to freeze everything within a hundred steps.

528
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:50,440
Moreover,

529
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,460
you've also mentioned

530
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,750
that she has the Phoenix-shaped mark on her.

531
00:27:53,880 --> 00:27:54,740
Great Guardian.

532
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:56,010
The Young Miss came so suddenly

533
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:57,560
and refused to tell us anything.

534
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,400
If something goes wrong,

535
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:01,440
we can't let the Tianxing Secret Treasury fall into trouble.

536
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:02,250
Indeed.

537
00:28:02,840 --> 00:28:04,520
The seal at the entrance of the Tianxing Secret Treasury

538
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:06,480
was personally set by our Master.

539
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:08,120
From what we can see now,

540
00:28:08,360 --> 00:28:09,920
it seems the only way

541
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:11,280
to know the truth is by activating it.

542
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,040
Only then

543
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:16,320
will we know who the real Young Miss is.

544
00:28:38,940 --> 00:28:40,610
The Phoenix-masked Woman promised

545
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:41,760
to take us to the island.

546
00:28:41,890 --> 00:28:43,410
When will she fulfill this promise?

547
00:28:43,430 --> 00:28:44,590
The young mistress has given an order.

548
00:28:44,610 --> 00:28:46,630
Three days from now, Tongming Island will appear.

549
00:28:47,050 --> 00:28:47,980
At that time,

550
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:49,390
she will take you to the island.

551
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:50,720
Is that true?

552
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:54,120
I have the Token as proof.

553
00:29:19,630 --> 00:29:20,810
Young Sect Leader.

554
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:23,680
Someone has already trespassed into the Myriad Isles Ice Lake to search for the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

555
00:29:23,840 --> 00:29:26,000
As a result, all of their bodies were found floating on the surface of the water.

556
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:28,340
Greed blinds them.

557
00:29:28,810 --> 00:29:30,350
If the Tianxing Secret Treasury truly contains

558
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,480
so many treasures,

559
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:33,430
how could they be so easily obtained?

560
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:34,960
There must be a conspiracy behind this.

561
00:29:34,980 --> 00:29:36,770
Young Sect Leader, you have tried your best to stop them,

562
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:38,920
but you still couldn't prevent them from rushing to their deaths.

563
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:42,720
By the way,

564
00:29:43,290 --> 00:29:44,830
is there any news from the Phoenix-masked Woman?

565
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,000
The Phoenix-masked Woman said that in three days,

566
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,640
Tongming Island will appear.

567
00:29:49,760 --> 00:29:51,040
Once this news spread,

568
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,930
everyone is eager

569
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:54,960
to be the first to reach Tongming Island.

570
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:56,800
When that time comes,

571
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:58,280
it might turn into a fierce battle.

572
00:29:59,040 --> 00:29:59,640
I understand.

573
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:00,640
Zifeng,

574
00:30:01,240 --> 00:30:02,120
tell Young Master Xie

575
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,880
to prepare the peach blossom wine.

576
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,070
I want to invite the Divine Healer for a drink tonight.

577
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:06,960
Yes.

578
00:30:26,420 --> 00:30:28,950
How could there possibly be two Feng Lixues in this world?

579
00:30:38,560 --> 00:30:40,140
It's precisely because you don't understand.

580
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,180
That's why you're not worthy of being Feng Lixue.

581
00:30:42,310 --> 00:30:44,470
You should have died along with Mo Xiao!

582
00:30:44,560 --> 00:30:45,760
You've been hiding your identity

583
00:30:45,780 --> 00:30:47,130
to stay by the Young Sect Leader's side.

584
00:30:47,150 --> 00:30:48,250
What exactly is it for?

585
00:30:48,680 --> 00:30:50,420
Hiding identity?

586
00:30:50,550 --> 00:30:51,770
What identity?

587
00:30:52,120 --> 00:30:53,560
The daughter of the Tianxing Sect leader,

588
00:30:53,640 --> 00:30:55,190
Feng Lixue.

589
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:56,400
Why?

590
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:59,120
They all say I am Feng Lixue.

591
00:31:04,560 --> 00:31:05,320
No, no.

592
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:08,090
We agreed on ten jars, why are there only five?

593
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:10,480
Why don't you check it first?

594
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:24,360
How is it?

595
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:26,040
Is it the authentic peach blossom wine?

596
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,320
It's authentic,

597
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:28,880
definitely authentic.

598
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:30,850
What about the other five jars?

599
00:31:31,000 --> 00:31:32,000
And then

600
00:31:32,020 --> 00:31:32,600
you pour the ten jars

601
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:34,400
into my wine gourd.

602
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,440
I'm leaving early tomorrow morning

603
00:31:36,560 --> 00:31:38,280
to meet an old friend.

604
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:42,160
I'm going to drink and play chess with him.

605
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,720
With such good wine,

606
00:31:43,920 --> 00:31:45,000
I'll have to ask him

607
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:47,320
to let me win a few more pieces this time.

608
00:31:47,860 --> 00:31:49,350
Divine Healer, you cannot leave tomorrow.

609
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:51,880
What?

610
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,080
Why can't I leave?

611
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:55,920
The girl you asked me to treat

612
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,000
has been cured.

613
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:59,320
Once I finish my business, I can leave.

614
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,520
You need to accompany me to meet someone else tomorrow.

615
00:32:03,960 --> 00:32:05,040
Another person?

616
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:06,400
Who?

617
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,110
I'll take you to meet him tomorrow.

618
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:09,680
No way.

619
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,440
We agreed to treat one person, and that's it.

620
00:32:12,560 --> 00:32:14,040
How come there's suddenly another person?

621
00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:15,000
I won't see her.

622
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:16,280
I won't see her no matter what you say.

623
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:19,800
Lingyun,

624
00:32:20,340 --> 00:32:22,000
the five jars of peach blossom wine...

625
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:24,360
The five jars of peach blossom wine haven't arrived yet.

626
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,400
I'm worried they might have broken them

627
00:32:26,440 --> 00:32:28,040
when they moved them off the boat.

628
00:32:28,160 --> 00:32:28,720
What?

629
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:29,920
What?

630
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:31,560
Broken?

631
00:32:33,010 --> 00:32:34,880
How could you let this happen?

632
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:38,280
Such fine wine,

633
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:39,920
found only in heaven.

634
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:41,840
How could there be any in the mortal world?

635
00:32:41,880 --> 00:32:42,960
You...

636
00:32:43,040 --> 00:32:44,410
You actually broke it?

637
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,120
I'm furious!

638
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:48,060
Divine Healer, please don't worry.

639
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,520
Those five jars of peach blossom wine should still be on the boat.

640
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:52,600
If you agree to accompany me to meet that person tomorrow,

641
00:32:52,620 --> 00:32:54,660
I'll make sure they handle the jars carefully

642
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,530
and not spill a drop,

643
00:32:56,550 --> 00:32:57,910
pouring it all into your wine gourd.

644
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,760
Very well.

645
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:04,920
You...

646
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,560
You...

647
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,200
Never mind.

648
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,280
I

649
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:15,800
have never been ordered around by anyone in my life.

650
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,360
But when it comes to this fine wine,

651
00:33:20,360 --> 00:33:22,000
I'll bow my head and follow orders.

652
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:47,520
Master.

653
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:48,480
What are your orders?

654
00:33:48,920 --> 00:33:50,680
Is there any news about Wu Chen's Master?

655
00:33:51,080 --> 00:33:51,720
No.

656
00:33:52,800 --> 00:33:53,960
Not a single piece of information.

657
00:33:54,360 --> 00:33:55,360
The Dandelion System

658
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:57,360
has always been able to capture all the past information of the world

659
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,640
without missing anything.

660
00:33:59,130 --> 00:34:00,860
Could it be that the Master mentioned by Miss Wu Chen

661
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,520
doesn't exist at all?

662
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:03,890
Or perhaps

663
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,480
her Master is not an ordinary mortal.

664
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,080
What about the Phoenix-masked Woman?

665
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:09,560
The Phoenix-masked Woman seemed to have been taken away by a mysterious person that day,

666
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:12,440
and finally disappeared at the boundary of Demon Sect's Mount Suyu.

667
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,840
No more information has been traced for now.

668
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:16,040
Mount Suyu.

669
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:18,159
It's indeed related to the Demon Sect.

670
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:19,480
I see.

671
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,520
Continue the investigation.

672
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,280
Yes.

673
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:35,659
Hopefully we can find the answer tomorrow.

674
00:34:47,020 --> 00:34:47,870
Hey, kid.

675
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,330
Is the person you arranged to meet coming or not?

676
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:52,000
If she doesn't show up soon, I'll just leave.

677
00:34:52,659 --> 00:34:53,420
Don't worry,

678
00:34:53,719 --> 00:34:54,909
she will definitely come.

679
00:35:02,450 --> 00:35:03,160
Great Guardian.

680
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:04,600
The Young Miss ordered us to keep an eye on

681
00:35:04,640 --> 00:35:05,560
every move Mo Xiao makes.

682
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,590
But we're not allowed to act.

683
00:35:07,690 --> 00:35:08,440
Why is that?

684
00:35:09,120 --> 00:35:10,440
The Young Miss

685
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:12,160
must avenge her father's death herself.

686
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,920
Who's that person next to Mo Xiao?

687
00:35:15,080 --> 00:35:16,680
He doesn't seem to be from the Shushan Sect.

688
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,660
The purple-gold gourd.

689
00:35:23,550 --> 00:35:24,390
He is Shi Bujiu.

690
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:26,520
The Divine Healer Shi Bujiu.

691
00:35:26,970 --> 00:35:28,960
He always carries a purple-gold wine gourd.

692
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:30,480
That's right, it's him.

693
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,440
Why would Mo Xiao bring Shi Bujiu here?

694
00:35:38,170 --> 00:35:39,170
Is

695
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,320
he also suspecting the Young Miss's identity?

696
00:36:07,050 --> 00:36:07,910
Before you came to Mang Mountain,

697
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,160
who were you?

698
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:15,080
Wu Chen.

699
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,320
What's wrong with you?

700
00:36:17,560 --> 00:36:18,640
You're practicing so hard.

701
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:20,390
You've been out so early to practice.

702
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:21,800
Don't you want to eat breakfast?

703
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,120
I asked the inn

704
00:36:23,160 --> 00:36:24,600
to make your favorite glutinous rice balls.

705
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:25,520
I'm not hungry.

706
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,720
I'll eat later.

707
00:36:29,120 --> 00:36:30,800
What's been going on with you these past couple of days?

708
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:32,880
You've seemed so distracted.

709
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,600
If you have something on your mind, tell me.

710
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:37,080
Jing.

711
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:39,720
Does your father

712
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:41,080
love you?

713
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:42,680
Of course.

714
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:44,320
My father loves me the most.

715
00:36:44,520 --> 00:36:46,320
Even though he's the Branch Leader of the Fengyu Branch,

716
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,960
and everyone in the sect fears him.

717
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:48,920
But,

718
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,000
he'll do anything

719
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:51,400
just to make me happy.

720
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,560
What does it feel like

721
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:55,920
to be loved by your father?

722
00:36:58,480 --> 00:36:59,800
Let me think.

723
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:02,070
It feels like

724
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:04,680
you're not afraid of anything in the world.

725
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,880
Why do you suddenly ask this?

726
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,920
It's nothing.

727
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:14,320
Wu Chen.

728
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:18,320
Are you missing your parents?

729
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,190
No.

730
00:37:20,670 --> 00:37:22,370
Since I can remember,

731
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:24,480
I've always lived in Mang Mountain.

732
00:37:25,090 --> 00:37:27,620
I don't even know who they are.

733
00:37:28,170 --> 00:37:29,570
Don't be sad.

734
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:31,040
Your parents

735
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:33,610
might have had some unavoidable reasons

736
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,680
for leaving you alone on Mang Mountain.

737
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:37,600
In this world,

738
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:39,640
there are no parents who don't love their children.

739
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,550
Even demons and monsters,

740
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:43,800
once they have children,

741
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,720
will give everything for them.

742
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:49,480
Just like Feng Xingtian, the owner of the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

743
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,120
His daughter also suffered from the extreme cold syndrome like you.

744
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:53,560
To save his daughter,

745
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:55,080
he gathered treasures from all over the world.

746
00:37:55,640 --> 00:37:58,040
This love for his daughter is quite touching.

747
00:37:58,840 --> 00:38:00,040
Feng Xingtian.

748
00:38:00,650 --> 00:38:01,730
His daughter

749
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,440
is the Phoenix-masked Woman.

750
00:38:03,960 --> 00:38:04,640
Yes.

751
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:06,970
She wants to open the Tianxing Secret Treasury,

752
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:09,160
causing all the sects in the martial arts world to scramble for it.

753
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:11,240
That's why Mo Xiao had to go and stop her.

754
00:38:12,080 --> 00:38:14,560
Mo Xiao has gone to find the Phoenix-masked Woman?

755
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,350
Mo Xiao is worried that you might be in danger again,

756
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,990
so he told me not to tell you.

757
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,920
Don't be upset.

758
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,260
There's plenty of time ahead.

759
00:38:45,560 --> 00:38:47,880
Who masters their martial arts in one go?

760
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:49,600
Actually,

761
00:38:49,720 --> 00:38:51,480
you don't need to worry too much about your background.

762
00:38:54,360 --> 00:38:57,400
Even though you're not exactly a pleasant person,

763
00:38:57,880 --> 00:38:59,520
we've known each other for a while now,

764
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,200
and I consider us friends.

765
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,640
If you don't have any family,

766
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:06,160
at least know that you have us.

767
00:39:06,840 --> 00:39:08,440
If you want to stay in the Shushan Sect,

768
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:10,680
after we resolve the crisis of the Tianxing Secret Treasury,

769
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,560
you can join the Shushan Sect

770
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,960
and become a disciple of the immortal sects.

771
00:39:14,440 --> 00:39:16,000
Doesn't that sound good?

772
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:19,000
What do you think?

773
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:21,840
Am I right?

774
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:24,960
Wu Chen.

775
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:27,560
Wu Chen!

776
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:31,880
Running off again.

777
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:45,790
She's here.

778
00:39:52,080 --> 00:39:52,760
Mo Xiao.

779
00:39:53,480 --> 00:39:55,840
You summoned me with the Phoenix Feather Token.

780
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:57,440
Are you seeking death?

781
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,800
When you first released the Phoenix Feather Order, you promised that

782
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,360
the one who held the Phoenix Feather Token

783
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,560
could come to Tongming Island.

784
00:40:02,910 --> 00:40:04,550
Now I have the Token in my hands,

785
00:40:04,890 --> 00:40:07,210
yet you say the treasures in the Tianxing Secret Treasury

786
00:40:07,510 --> 00:40:08,960
belong to everyone in the world.

787
00:40:09,020 --> 00:40:10,500
What exactly do you mean?

788
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,600
I'm the one who can open the Tianxing Secret Treasury.

789
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:16,240
So I make the rules.

790
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:17,680
You go back on your word.

791
00:40:17,960 --> 00:40:19,200
How can anyone trust you?

792
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,720
Who do I need to convince?

793
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:25,680
You want to enter the Tianxing Secret Treasury so badly

794
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:29,460
and brought helpers with you.

795
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:32,350
I don't want to go to the Tongming Island.

796
00:40:32,480 --> 00:40:33,600
I'm not here to help either.

797
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,520
I'm just a doctor.

798
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:38,320
Shi Bujiu.

799
00:40:39,000 --> 00:40:40,440
You brought Shi Bujiu here.

800
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,080
Are you doubting my identity?

801
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:43,920
You know me?

802
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:45,000
Of course.

803
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:47,400
If it wasn't

804
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:49,720
because you saved my life,

805
00:40:50,160 --> 00:40:52,350
you can't cure my extreme cold syndrome.

806
00:40:52,600 --> 00:40:53,920
How would my father have gone to Shushan

807
00:40:53,940 --> 00:40:55,280
to participate in the Snow Peak event?

808
00:40:55,520 --> 00:40:56,820
How would the lives of my father and me

809
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,400
have died there?

810
00:40:59,860 --> 00:41:01,240
It looks like today is the day.

811
00:41:01,560 --> 00:41:03,070
I'll take the lives

812
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:04,560
of all three of you.

813
00:41:05,480 --> 00:41:07,600
Was Feng Xingtian's quest for the Millennium Token

814
00:41:08,030 --> 00:41:09,310
really for his daughter?

815
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,720
Your father?

816
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,640
You are also Feng Lixue.

817
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:15,180
Indeed.

818
00:41:17,910 --> 00:41:18,640
Divine Healer, be careful!

819
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,440
Tell me.

820
00:41:24,520 --> 00:41:26,110
What is all this nonsense?

821
00:41:39,610 --> 00:41:41,180
You want to die knowing the truth, don't you?

822
00:41:41,660 --> 00:41:42,630
I'll grant you that wish.

823
00:41:44,610 --> 00:41:45,560
Divine Healer, be careful!

824
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:46,400
Impossible.

825
00:41:46,490 --> 00:41:47,530
How can this be possible?

826
00:41:48,230 --> 00:41:50,200
How can there be two Feng Lixue?

827
00:41:50,370 --> 00:41:51,560
It's impossible to distinguish between the real and the fake.

828
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:53,340
It's truly impossible to tell them apart.

829
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:55,220
How is it possible?

830
00:41:55,970 --> 00:41:57,900
How can there be two Feng Lixue?
