1
00:01:31,150 --> 00:01:35,710
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:38,700
(Episode 36)

3
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:40,110
No,

4
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,340
this is not your fault.

5
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,460
This is my fault.

6
00:01:49,150 --> 00:01:50,810
Being the son of the Demon Lord

7
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,830
is the original sin.

8
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:05,340
I know...

9
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,259
this truth

10
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:11,280
may be hard for you to accept.

11
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:14,860
But for the past 18 years,

12
00:02:14,860 --> 00:02:17,240
I really had no idea you were at the Shushan Sect.

13
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:18,300
Don't say anymore!

14
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:29,120
Alright.

15
00:02:32,350 --> 00:02:33,950
Let's put that aside for now.

16
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:38,910
But

17
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:41,470
there's something more important.

18
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,930
This was left to you by your master.

19
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:52,470
I brought this specifically to give to you.

20
00:02:53,500 --> 00:02:55,700
Why would the things my master left for me

21
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:57,230
have been entrusted to you?

22
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,440
I wondered the same.

23
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:02,010
However,

24
00:03:02,470 --> 00:03:04,050
this was delivered by Immortal Lord Xuan Zhen, the Branch Leader

25
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:06,310
of the Baicao Branch of the Shushan Sect.

26
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:08,420
She said your master

27
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:11,080
sacrificed his life to protect these two items.

28
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:13,400
And now, she believes

29
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:14,850
that in this world,

30
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:17,130
the only person who will believe in you

31
00:03:17,130 --> 00:03:18,190
and protect you...

32
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,329
is me, your mother.

33
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,640
That's why she went to great lengths to entrust them to me.

34
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,890
I'll wait for you outside.

35
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,860
That won't be necessary.

36
00:03:50,770 --> 00:03:52,770
Since Master entrusted it to you...

37
00:03:53,590 --> 00:03:55,590
naturally, you don't need to leave.

38
00:03:56,530 --> 00:03:58,060
Let's check them together.

39
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:09,090
The Sect Leader's Token?

40
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,170
Murong Changfeng was indeed hunting you down

41
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:13,830
for this Sect Leader's Token.

42
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,410
But why didn't your master

43
00:04:16,410 --> 00:04:18,350
pass the Sect Leader's Token to him

44
00:04:18,380 --> 00:04:20,980
instead of protecting it just to give it to you?

45
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:31,980
What are these?

46
00:04:34,159 --> 00:04:35,890
Immortal Lord Xuan Zhen told me

47
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:39,070
that before Former Leader Yuan passed away,

48
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,380
he had destroyed his own eyes.

49
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,560
Could these be...

50
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:51,340
Master.

51
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:53,550
Master, you gouged out your own eyes and left them for me.

52
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:55,210
Did you try to warn me about something?

53
00:04:55,210 --> 00:04:56,940
Please, Master, enlighten me.

54
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:50,110
Could this be my master's memories

55
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:51,150
from 18 years ago?

56
00:05:53,470 --> 00:05:54,740
Mo Xiao.

57
00:05:57,100 --> 00:05:57,890
Master.

58
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,350
What you're seeing now

59
00:06:00,590 --> 00:06:03,430
is indeed the past that I experienced.

60
00:06:04,390 --> 00:06:07,640
18 years ago, during the great battle between immortals and demons,

61
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:12,000
your father, Yeyuan, and Chongguang launched an assault on Mount Buzhou.

62
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:16,290
The Millennium Token was almost activated by your father.

63
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:19,160
Fortunately,

64
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:22,570
Sword Sovereign Fengyue came out of seclusion early

65
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:24,800
just in time to stop him.

66
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,900
However, the seal on the Millennium Token had already been damaged.

67
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:32,200
A trace of divine power had leaked out.

68
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:35,890
Chongguang secretly stole it

69
00:06:36,440 --> 00:06:39,780
and then used it to forge the Heavenly Demon Token.

70
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:56,090
Yeyuan heard the cry of a baby

71
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,830
and sensed that his consort, Xuyuan Wushuang,

72
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:01,900
had given birth to their son.

73
00:07:06,540 --> 00:07:07,860
At that time,

74
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:12,310
the Heavenly Demon Token had already been destroyed by
Sword Sovereign Fengyue,

75
00:07:12,310 --> 00:07:14,110
shattering into three pieces

76
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:16,620
that transformed into three demon stones.

77
00:07:17,210 --> 00:07:20,540
Two of them fell toward the foot of Mount Buzhou.

78
00:07:26,060 --> 00:07:27,710
Yeyuan was left

79
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:30,990
with only one piece, the Demon Stone of Love and Desire.

80
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:35,659
He handed it, along with the Heavenly Demon Sect, over to Chongguang.

81
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,470
The Sword Sovereign brought the baby back to Xuanqing Court,

82
00:07:41,780 --> 00:07:43,360
named him Mo Xiao,

83
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,040
and passed down the entire Fengyue Sword Technique to him.

84
00:07:47,640 --> 00:07:52,240
He instructed me to protect and support Mo Xiao
to be the leader of the Shushan Sect.

85
00:07:52,360 --> 00:07:54,310
He said that if the Demon Sect were to act up again,

86
00:07:54,310 --> 00:07:57,630
the only person who could prevent the Millennium Token

87
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:01,690
from causing another catastrophe would be him.

88
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,020
Mo Xiao, whether you are of human or demon blood,

89
00:08:04,020 --> 00:08:06,050
as long as your heart remains steadfast on the righteous path,

90
00:08:06,050 --> 00:08:10,180
you are the disciple in whom the Sword Sovereign placed his greatest hope.

91
00:08:10,550 --> 00:08:14,040
You are the guardian of the Shushan Sect

92
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,070
and all living beings under heaven.

93
00:08:16,900 --> 00:08:17,950
Master...

94
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:21,250
Master...

95
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:52,900
Mother.

96
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:55,990
How is my brother?

97
00:09:58,140 --> 00:09:59,710
What were you two doing inside?

98
00:09:59,710 --> 00:10:01,790
You two, mother and son, should be embracing each other in tears
after finally being reunited.

99
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:03,550
Why was there no sound at all?

100
00:10:05,180 --> 00:10:06,480
Is he still not awake?

101
00:10:07,330 --> 00:10:08,110
I'll wake him up.

102
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:08,880
No need.

103
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:10,110
Elder,

104
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:11,750
let him be for now.

105
00:10:11,970 --> 00:10:13,440
Don't disturb him.

106
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,760
But Mother,

107
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:15,690
then...

108
00:10:16,290 --> 00:10:18,420
will he be willing to come back with us?

109
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,070
Let him make that decision himself.

110
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:39,320
Mo Xiao is actually a demon's son!

111
00:10:39,320 --> 00:10:44,180
I am not a demon!

112
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:45,580
Mo Xiao!

113
00:10:46,110 --> 00:10:47,960
Remember what I said:

114
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,910
no matter where you are,

115
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,330
never stray from your righteous heart!

116
00:10:55,270 --> 00:10:56,270
Today,

117
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:59,100
I'll gouge out my own eyes

118
00:10:59,630 --> 00:11:01,490
and destroy my spiritual essence

119
00:11:01,630 --> 00:11:03,490
as atonement to the Shushan Sect!

120
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:07,090
I pay for my sins

121
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,400
with my life!

122
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,640
You useless bunch of fools!

123
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:42,340
How were you watching over the Supreme Consort?

124
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:44,420
If you still can't find her,

125
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,500
I will

126
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,900
throw you all into the Heavenly Demon Abyss!

127
00:11:48,900 --> 00:11:50,330
We're sorry, Supreme Lord,

128
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:52,190
please forgive us!

129
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:15,140
Where have you been...

130
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:16,670
these past few hours?

131
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:31,920
Supreme Lord,

132
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,810
what's wrong?

133
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,730
Take the medicinal wine I've prepared

134
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,720
to the Supreme Consort.

135
00:12:57,020 --> 00:12:57,660
Master.

136
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,900
I'll return to the Heavenly Demon Sect with you.

137
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:04,460
Saintess.

138
00:14:05,210 --> 00:14:06,100
Can't you...

139
00:14:06,190 --> 00:14:07,810
stay with the clan?

140
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:10,370
You've just returned after so long.

141
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:16,660
I owe the clan too much.

142
00:14:17,610 --> 00:14:20,070
I'm grateful that you haven't abandoned me.

143
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:24,240
But since I've made the choice,

144
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,560
there's no turning back.

145
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,160
Everyone, please remember:

146
00:14:36,890 --> 00:14:38,170
from this day on,

147
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,330
I, Xuyuan Wushuang,

148
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,770
and Mo Xiao

149
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,140
have no connection to the Nüwa Clan.

150
00:15:00,190 --> 00:15:01,050
I, Wushuang...

151
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:04,410
hereby bid you all farewell.

152
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,820
This is good, good.

153
00:15:10,430 --> 00:15:11,980
Finally, there's someone

154
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,160
taking this kid in.

155
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:14,530
As for me,

156
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:17,240
I can now travel the world without any worries.

157
00:16:49,090 --> 00:16:50,740
That stubborn Lil' Hammer,

158
00:16:50,760 --> 00:16:52,260
with his strange temperament,

159
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:53,320
will never change.

160
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,080
Well,

161
00:16:54,250 --> 00:16:56,110
his daughter and grandson are leaving,

162
00:16:56,110 --> 00:16:58,510
and he doesn't even come out to see them off.

163
00:17:00,810 --> 00:17:01,810
I don't blame him.

164
00:17:03,740 --> 00:17:04,980
My father has lived

165
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:07,200
his entire life for the clan.

166
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,890
In his life,

167
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:13,190
there shouldn't have been farewells.

168
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,620
Let's go.

169
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:38,760
Supreme Lord,

170
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:41,270
Xuyuan Wushuang has found Mo Xiao

171
00:18:41,460 --> 00:18:43,590
and is bringing him back to Mount Suyu.

172
00:18:44,040 --> 00:18:45,830
They're actually coming back together.

173
00:18:45,830 --> 00:18:46,310
Yes.

174
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,700
Xuyuan Wushuang has also sent secret orders

175
00:18:48,700 --> 00:18:49,860
to the Seven Caves and Nine Netherworlds,

176
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:52,250
saying that Yeyuan's son has returned to the Heavenly Demon Sect.

177
00:18:52,250 --> 00:18:54,360
She's requested all grand elders from the Seven Caves and Nine Netherworlds

178
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:56,760
to come to Mount Suyu to pay their respects.

179
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,060
When a son returns home,

180
00:18:58,060 --> 00:18:59,860
his mother is, of course, happy.

181
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,780
It's only fitting to make this a grand occasion.

182
00:19:02,810 --> 00:19:03,880
Rest assured, Supreme Lord,

183
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,530
the grand elders from the Seven Caves and Nine Netherworlds

184
00:19:06,530 --> 00:19:09,120
have already made their stance clear—they won't go.

185
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:09,640
No.

186
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:12,720
Tell them

187
00:19:13,320 --> 00:19:14,250
they all must go.

188
00:19:16,140 --> 00:19:17,100
I will go as well.

189
00:19:18,140 --> 00:19:21,000
Supreme Lord, you mean to personally welcome them?

190
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:25,050
And our Supreme Consort as well.

191
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,560
To welcome our Young Supreme Lord back,

192
00:19:29,790 --> 00:19:32,070
we must dress in our finest attire.

193
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,070
The Supreme Lord has issued an order.

194
00:20:10,070 --> 00:20:11,110
Star Lord Xuyuan

195
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,420
actually dared to bring Mo Xiao, the former leader of the Shushan Sect,

196
00:20:13,420 --> 00:20:14,540
back to Mount Suyu.

197
00:20:14,760 --> 00:20:17,260
Mo Xiao is already a wanted person by the immortal sects.

198
00:20:17,260 --> 00:20:19,770
Bringing him back to Mount Suyu will undoubtedly invite trouble.

199
00:20:19,770 --> 00:20:21,830
The Supreme Lord orders the grand elders from the Seven Caves
and Nine Netherworlds

200
00:20:21,830 --> 00:20:23,830
to go down the mountain and prevent Mo Xiao from coming here.

201
00:20:23,830 --> 00:20:25,830
Let the elders go down the mountain?

202
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:27,110
What?

203
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:29,740
Does the Supreme Lord need to come and order you personally?

204
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,800
But Guardian Chang Ming just came and instructed us

205
00:20:31,800 --> 00:20:33,240
to keep the four grand elders

206
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:34,660
under close watch here.

207
00:20:34,690 --> 00:20:35,350
For three days,

208
00:20:35,350 --> 00:20:37,350
they are not allowed to have any contact with any sect.

209
00:20:37,350 --> 00:20:40,080
Why are they suddenly allowed to go down the mountain now?

210
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,520
Do you really think the Supreme Lord needs to

211
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:43,340
consult you on how to make decisions?

212
00:20:43,340 --> 00:20:44,530
I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't dare.

213
00:20:44,530 --> 00:20:46,570
Have the four elders prepare themselves now.

214
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:48,070
I have to go back to report to the Supreme Lord.

215
00:20:48,070 --> 00:20:48,840
Yes, sir.

216
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,640
I've done everything as you said.

217
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:05,490
Let me go.

218
00:21:06,060 --> 00:21:07,880
I won't breathe a word to anyone.

219
00:21:54,740 --> 00:21:56,030
Thank you, Supreme Lord,

220
00:21:56,030 --> 00:21:58,430
for coming down the mountain to welcome us.

221
00:21:58,630 --> 00:22:01,080
Yeyuan, my brother, is watching over us from heaven,

222
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,720
and finally, we have found his son.

223
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:06,120
Such a joyous matter.

224
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:09,240
How could I not come to welcome you personally?

225
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,160
It's just that today,

226
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,780
the news came so suddenly,

227
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:15,940
and I didn't have time to prepare.

228
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,160
Tomorrow, in the Ancestral Hall,

229
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,080
I must hold a grand ceremony

230
00:22:20,260 --> 00:22:23,490
to welcome our Young Supreme Lord back.

231
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:25,120
The return of the Young Supreme Lord

232
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:26,580
is a cause for celebration

233
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:28,560
in our Heavenly Demon Clan!

234
00:22:30,670 --> 00:22:33,400
Thank you for your kindness, Supreme Lord, then.

235
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,120
You are one of us by blood.

236
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:44,500
There's no need for formalities.

237
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:48,900
-Mo Xiao must not set foot on Mount Suyu!
-Mo Xiao must not set foot on Mount Suyu!

238
00:22:55,030 --> 00:22:56,300
Stop him!

239
00:24:02,260 --> 00:24:03,790
Supreme Lord, should we...

240
00:24:07,770 --> 00:24:08,830
All of you, stop.

241
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,450
What is the meaning of this, Supreme Consort?

242
00:24:31,450 --> 00:24:32,580
You don't belong here.

243
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:33,780
You need to leave now!

244
00:24:36,920 --> 00:24:39,080
Supreme Consort, are you afraid that my return

245
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,410
will threaten the Demon Lord's position?

246
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,070
But I am the son of Yeyuan.

247
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:46,150
All of this should rightfully be mine.

248
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,250
You are the heir to the Fengyue Sword.

249
00:24:49,350 --> 00:24:51,350
You are not the son of the Demon Lord.

250
00:25:12,650 --> 00:25:14,350
That sword means nothing

251
00:25:15,150 --> 00:25:16,880
to me anymore.

252
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:19,120
Go.

253
00:25:20,230 --> 00:25:20,990
Go!

254
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:13,960
-Welcome back to the palace, Young Supreme Lord.
-Welcome back to the palace, Young Supreme Lord.

255
00:26:15,400 --> 00:26:16,600
You may rise.

256
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,340
Mo Xiao is tired.

257
00:26:19,550 --> 00:26:21,430
You may leave now and let him rest.

258
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:22,400
Yes.

259
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:30,790
Mo Xiao.

260
00:26:31,400 --> 00:26:33,860
I've prepared a room for you in the side hall.

261
00:26:33,930 --> 00:26:36,150
It's cleaned daily, with everything prepared.

262
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:38,040
I'll take you there to rest now.

263
00:27:04,290 --> 00:27:05,170
You're awake?

264
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:07,940
Yes.

265
00:27:14,910 --> 00:27:16,970
You've been fooling me all this time.

266
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:18,080
Yes.

267
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,000
When was your Puppet Spell...

268
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:26,150
lifted?

269
00:27:26,950 --> 00:27:28,410
When I went to save Mo Xiao,

270
00:27:28,920 --> 00:27:30,450
his Fengyue Sword

271
00:27:30,780 --> 00:27:32,210
broke my Puppet Spell.

272
00:27:41,700 --> 00:27:42,500
Mo Xiao...

273
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:53,710
When you learned that Mo Xiao had gone to the Nüwa Clan...

274
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:56,290
you disappeared for half a day.

275
00:27:56,520 --> 00:27:58,640
So, you went to the Li River,

276
00:27:58,660 --> 00:27:59,480
right?

277
00:28:00,670 --> 00:28:01,190
Yes.

278
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:06,470
Worried that the people of the Shushan Sect might harm him?

279
00:28:08,530 --> 00:28:10,950
You released the Four Grand Elders of

280
00:28:11,540 --> 00:28:14,270
the Seven Caves and Nine Netherworlds on purpose

281
00:28:14,650 --> 00:28:17,710
so they'd try to block Mo Xiao from reaching Mount Suyu,

282
00:28:18,820 --> 00:28:19,480
didn't you?

283
00:28:20,330 --> 00:28:20,890
Yes.

284
00:28:34,600 --> 00:28:36,000
Why did you lie to me?

285
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,940
With the Puppet Spell controlling me,

286
00:28:39,940 --> 00:28:42,470
you wouldn't have been so guarded against me.

287
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,060
But now,

288
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:53,860
there's an undeniable fact:

289
00:28:55,220 --> 00:28:56,880
you are already my consort.

290
00:29:02,470 --> 00:29:04,220
Supreme Lord, you only married me

291
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:06,260
to lure Mo Xiao out.

292
00:29:07,310 --> 00:29:09,460
I never agreed to become your consort.

293
00:29:09,880 --> 00:29:12,340
And all of that was just for show.

294
00:29:12,530 --> 00:29:14,130
It doesn't change anything.

295
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,810
In her free time,

296
00:30:13,950 --> 00:30:16,570
the Star Lord has always been busy sewing various clothes,

297
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,620
imagining your current age and size,

298
00:30:19,690 --> 00:30:21,150
and making them one by one.

299
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,180
Young Supreme Lord, today I saw you in person

300
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,870
and discovered that the clothes made by the Star Lord

301
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,080
fit you perfectly.

302
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:31,390
This truly shows the bond between a mother and her son.

303
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:33,790
Since you call me the "Young Supreme Lord,"

304
00:30:34,810 --> 00:30:35,800
let me ask you:

305
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:38,440
what should the true ruler of Mount Suyu

306
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:41,480
be like?

307
00:30:57,540 --> 00:31:00,640
(Sword Pavilion)

308
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,680
Recently,
(Sword Pavilion)

309
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:01,700
(Sword Pavilion)

310
00:31:01,700 --> 00:31:03,880
the Shushan Sect encountered a sudden crisis!
(Sword Pavilion)

311
00:31:03,880 --> 00:31:04,970
In an instant,

312
00:31:04,990 --> 00:31:06,820
all the immortal sects were filled with fear and unrest,

313
00:31:06,820 --> 00:31:07,980
teetering on the brink of collapse!

314
00:31:07,980 --> 00:31:10,800
Fortunately, Murong Changfeng, the head of the Fengyu Branch,

315
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:11,830
(Sword Pavilion)
Fortunately, Murong Changfeng, the head of the Fengyu Branch,

316
00:31:11,830 --> 00:31:11,850
(Sword Pavilion)

317
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:13,180
was appointed as the acting sect leader of the Shushan Sect
in this critical moment.
(Sword Pavilion)

318
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:15,450
was appointed as the acting sect leader of the Shushan Sect
in this critical moment.

319
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,740
He severely punished those who betrayed
the righteous path and turned to evil,

320
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:19,130
stabilized the Shushan Sect,

321
00:31:19,130 --> 00:31:21,210
and calmed the immortal sects!

322
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,340
Now,

323
00:31:22,370 --> 00:31:23,760
although the demons haven't yet been fully vanquished,

324
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,500
the turmoil has subsided!

325
00:31:25,530 --> 00:31:28,380
Today, we all gather at the Shushan Sect

326
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,880
to congratulate Sect Leader Murong

327
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:32,060
on officially assuming the position of Shushan Sect Leader!

328
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:34,050
(Sword Pavilion)
on officially assuming the position of Shushan Sect Leader!

329
00:31:34,050 --> 00:31:40,870
(Sword Pavilion)

330
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:54,960
Our Shushan Sect

331
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:57,570
has always been the leader among the immortal sects,

332
00:31:57,570 --> 00:31:59,110
respected by all.

333
00:32:00,770 --> 00:32:01,450
This time,

334
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,970
such a treacherous villain emerged from within.

335
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:07,240
Fortunately, our Immortal Sect of Shushan

336
00:32:07,240 --> 00:32:09,310
has risen like a phoenix from the ashes,

337
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,470
enduring hardships

338
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,290
and surviving the catastrophe.

339
00:32:12,530 --> 00:32:13,870
I, Murong Changfeng,

340
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,930
vow to take on the responsibility of eliminating evil
and protecting the righteous path!

341
00:32:17,930 --> 00:32:21,490
Together with all of you, I'll uphold the righteous path!

342
00:32:24,790 --> 00:32:28,430
From now on, we will continue to follow the Shushan Sect's lead,

343
00:32:28,870 --> 00:32:30,870
following Sect Leader Murong,

344
00:32:31,140 --> 00:32:32,690
united in purpose and spirit

345
00:32:32,690 --> 00:32:34,350
to cleanse the world of all evil!

346
00:32:34,350 --> 00:32:37,670
United in purpose, we eliminate all evil!

347
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:41,020
United in purpose, we eliminate all evil!

348
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,270
Lingyun.

349
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:24,160
I know why you still don't want to wake up.

350
00:33:25,990 --> 00:33:27,710
You're disappointed, right?

351
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,050
Disappointed in Mo Xiao,

352
00:33:31,770 --> 00:33:33,770
disappointed in our senior master,

353
00:33:34,520 --> 00:33:36,250
and disappointed in yourself.

354
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,360
We were once so good,

355
00:33:40,300 --> 00:33:42,130
so full of ambition.

356
00:33:43,430 --> 00:33:46,490
Together we shouldered the future of the Shushan Sect,

357
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:49,100
protected the people of this world,

358
00:33:49,710 --> 00:33:52,910
and would have maintained peace for generations to come.

359
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:55,320
But suddenly,

360
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,030
everything fell apart.

361
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:00,200
Everything changed.

362
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,030
I believe

363
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:05,120
some people

364
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:06,870
may change their identity,

365
00:34:07,210 --> 00:34:08,760
but their hearts remain the same.

366
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:10,489
They can still be brought back.

367
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:12,770
But for others,

368
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:15,670
it's their hearts that have changed.

369
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,840
Once a person's heart changes,

370
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:20,040
they're lost forever.

371
00:34:26,389 --> 00:34:27,320
Lingyun.

372
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:32,000
I'm going to bring back the one whose heart remains unchanged.

373
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,170
When I return,

374
00:34:33,920 --> 00:34:35,460
you must wake up.

375
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:07,440
Ce,

376
00:35:07,750 --> 00:35:09,750
can you help me take care of Lingyun?

377
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:13,200
Help you take care of him?

378
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,440
Where are you going?

379
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,100
I'm leaving the Shushan Sect.

380
00:35:19,150 --> 00:35:19,790
Jing,

381
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:22,360
I know a lot has happened recently,

382
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:24,540
and it's hard for you to take it all in.

383
00:35:24,540 --> 00:35:26,960
But look at the current situation in our Shushan Sect.

384
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,970
Father has just succeeded as the Sect Leader,

385
00:35:28,970 --> 00:35:30,140
leading the immortal sects.

386
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:31,940
This is when he needs us the most.

387
00:35:32,010 --> 00:35:33,070
You've grown up too

388
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:35,340
and should learn to share Father's burdens.

389
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,360
Don't be willful.

390
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:37,650
Come back with me,

391
00:35:37,670 --> 00:35:38,230
okay?

392
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,460
I won't help him.

393
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:43,760
The things he wants

394
00:35:44,190 --> 00:35:45,670
make me hate him more.

395
00:35:46,510 --> 00:35:48,510
Why do you speak of Father like this?

396
00:35:49,790 --> 00:35:51,450
What's wrong with you lately?

397
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,040
You're not as cheerful as you used to be.

398
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:55,940
You rarely even return to the Fengyu Branch anymore,

399
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:58,190
and you avoid Father like the plague.

400
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,480
Why is this?

401
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:00,950
Ce,

402
00:36:01,840 --> 00:36:03,900
do you really trust Father that much?

403
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,310
What kind of question is that?

404
00:36:06,310 --> 00:36:07,900
He is the father, and I am the son.

405
00:36:07,900 --> 00:36:09,160
Of course, I trust him.

406
00:36:09,550 --> 00:36:10,870
If one day

407
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:13,560
you find out he's been lying to you

408
00:36:14,190 --> 00:36:15,570
and lying to everyone,

409
00:36:16,530 --> 00:36:17,930
will you still trust him

410
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,130
and help him?

411
00:36:19,910 --> 00:36:21,350
Did you know something?

412
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:32,170
Nothing.

413
00:36:33,670 --> 00:36:35,600
It's just that the Shushan Sect now

414
00:36:35,990 --> 00:36:37,830
is no longer what it used to be.

415
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:41,550
Mo Xiao is the demon's son,

416
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:43,470
and Lingyun is in a coma.

417
00:36:44,710 --> 00:36:46,310
Master Yuan has passed away.

418
00:36:47,500 --> 00:36:49,160
The Luntian Branch is sealed,

419
00:36:49,370 --> 00:36:51,170
and the Tiance Villa lies empty.

420
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,930
There is no more

421
00:36:53,450 --> 00:36:55,970
laughter and joy in here as there once was.

422
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:58,330
That's life.

423
00:36:58,470 --> 00:36:59,830
Growing up

424
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,290
always means losing something.

425
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:02,840
No.

426
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:05,220
Some things aren't meant to be lost.

427
00:37:05,280 --> 00:37:07,020
I'm going to find them and bring them back.

428
00:37:07,020 --> 00:37:07,640
Jing...

429
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:08,220
Ce,

430
00:37:09,500 --> 00:37:11,620
please take good care of Lingyun for me.

431
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:13,080
When I find the answer,

432
00:37:13,170 --> 00:37:14,250
I'll come back.

433
00:37:16,610 --> 00:37:17,440
Jing...

434
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:39,780
Star Lord,

435
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:41,640
it's all my fault for talking too much

436
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,990
to the Young Supreme Lord

437
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,170
about Supreme Lord Chongguang's conduct.

438
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:47,230
Then, the Young Supreme Lord just...

439
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:51,110
But he doesn't seem happy.

440
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,980
He's just returned from the immortal sects,

441
00:37:54,980 --> 00:37:55,870
and now suddenly

442
00:37:55,870 --> 00:37:57,760
he has to accept everything here.

443
00:37:58,110 --> 00:37:59,650
Indeed, he needs time.

444
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:04,220
Let him be.

445
00:38:55,310 --> 00:38:56,090
Star Lord,

446
00:38:56,120 --> 00:38:58,180
the Star Lord of Shaohao has arrived.

447
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,440
Supreme Consort, what brings you here?

448
00:39:09,310 --> 00:39:10,530
Star Lord Xuyuan,

449
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:12,120
how is...

450
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:14,120
Mo Xiao doing?

451
00:39:15,750 --> 00:39:19,610
Supreme Consort, you're asking about the Young Supreme Lord, right?

452
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:21,760
Yes.

453
00:39:22,830 --> 00:39:24,030
He's doing very well.

454
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:26,600
I'm sure you've heard and seen it yourself.

455
00:39:26,930 --> 00:39:30,190
He's now the Young Supreme Lord of the Heavenly Demon Clan.

456
00:39:30,510 --> 00:39:33,570
Delicacies, fine wines, songstresses, and concubines—

457
00:39:33,570 --> 00:39:34,650
whatever he wants

458
00:39:34,680 --> 00:39:36,190
and whatever he should have,

459
00:39:36,190 --> 00:39:38,790
I, as his mother, will give to him.

460
00:39:39,270 --> 00:39:42,730
There's no need for you to concern yourself, Supreme Consort.

461
00:39:43,510 --> 00:39:44,260
Indeed.

462
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:46,580
You are his mother.

463
00:39:47,130 --> 00:39:49,680
Naturally, you'll give him the most selfless love.

464
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,410
It's just that Mo Xiao grew up in the immortal sects

465
00:39:52,410 --> 00:39:55,210
and was educated to slay demons and exorcise evil.

466
00:39:55,540 --> 00:39:57,730
I'm afraid he may not be able to accept all of this...

467
00:39:57,730 --> 00:39:59,440
Supreme Consort, you're here to take the Supreme Lord's place

468
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:00,910
in caring for me?

469
00:40:08,860 --> 00:40:11,460
I, Mo Xiao, have not yet paid my respects to you.

470
00:40:13,320 --> 00:40:14,940
However, I have a question

471
00:40:14,970 --> 00:40:15,920
that I would like to ask you, Supreme Consort.

472
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,580
The Former Lord and the Supreme Lord
addressed each other as brothers.

473
00:40:18,580 --> 00:40:19,740
Then, as a junior,

474
00:40:19,760 --> 00:40:22,360
should I pay my respects to you accordingly?

475
00:40:28,260 --> 00:40:30,540
However, I've only recently returned to Mount Suyu.

476
00:40:30,540 --> 00:40:32,760
I'm not yet fully familiar with the etiquette

477
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:34,100
and rules here.

478
00:40:34,400 --> 00:40:35,660
Moreover,

479
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:38,540
with so many demon concubines and beauties around,

480
00:40:38,860 --> 00:40:40,790
how could I have the time and energy

481
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:42,350
to learn all of these rules?

482
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,820
If I've shown any disrespect to you, Demon Consort,

483
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,820
I humbly request your forgiveness.

484
00:40:50,630 --> 00:40:51,760
I've disturbed you.

485
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:14,780
Son,

486
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,230
you did the right thing.

487
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:18,640
Now, Feng Lixue is Chongguang's consort.

488
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,000
You two can never...

489
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,100
I'm a bit tired.

490
00:41:31,850 --> 00:41:32,800
Star Lord,

491
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,090
the Young Supreme Lord has just returned

492
00:41:35,090 --> 00:41:37,110
and is naturally still not used to all of this.

493
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:38,390
After some time,

494
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,570
he'll adjust.

495
00:41:41,990 --> 00:41:43,930
I didn't protect him well.

496
00:41:47,320 --> 00:41:48,510
But it's alright.

497
00:41:49,070 --> 00:41:50,480
As long as he's come home,

498
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:52,440
that's enough.
