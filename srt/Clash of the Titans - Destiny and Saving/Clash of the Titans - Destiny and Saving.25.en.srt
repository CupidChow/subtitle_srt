00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:35,750
(Destiny and Saving)

2
00:01:35,789 --> 00:01:38,720
(Episode 25)

3
00:01:42,670 --> 00:01:44,820
For 18 years, you've kept your silence,

4
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:46,890
staying out of sect affairs,

5
00:01:47,030 --> 00:01:48,190
asking for nothing.

6
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:52,530
But all this time, you've been secretly looking for someone,

7
00:01:52,570 --> 00:01:53,300
haven't you?

8
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:55,350
You knew?

9
00:01:55,530 --> 00:01:56,650
Of course I did.

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,500
You want to use the Sacred Stone's demonic power

11
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:03,900
to find your own son.

12
00:02:04,290 --> 00:02:05,090
That's right.

13
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:07,860
My son carries the true blood of Yeyuan.

14
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,860
He's the rightful heir to Mount Suyu and the Three Sacred Stones.

15
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,620
And you

16
00:02:12,340 --> 00:02:14,680
are nothing but a usurper.

17
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,380
What a pity.

18
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:18,290
You've searched for 18 years

19
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:19,960
and still haven't found him.

20
00:02:21,210 --> 00:02:22,610
Tell me,

21
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:24,300
what made you

22
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:25,780
stop holding back

23
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,860
and give up waiting?

24
00:02:28,579 --> 00:02:29,660
It's Mo Xiao.

25
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,870
Tell me more.

26
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:40,920
At first, I thought

27
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:44,050
you were using Feng Lixue to manipulate him,

28
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,840
trying to harness the Sword Sovereign Fengyue's techniques

29
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:47,970
to awaken the Stone of Insatiability.

30
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,010
But later, I realized I was wrong.

31
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,940
You pulled Mo Xiao into your scheme

32
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,870
not just because he's the Sword Sovereign Fengyue's successor.

33
00:02:58,870 --> 00:03:00,730
He broke into our Ancestral Hall,

34
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:03,300
yet managed to set up a barrier in the forbidden grounds.

35
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:04,540
He fell into the Heavenly Demon Abyss

36
00:03:04,540 --> 00:03:06,180
but still managed to escape unscathed.

37
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:06,950
And you

38
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:10,840
kept playing this game of capture and release with him

39
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:12,630
because there's

40
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:15,470
something you're hiding about him, isn't there?

41
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,940
What do you think the hidden truth is?

42
00:04:18,260 --> 00:04:19,410
It's because

43
00:04:20,899 --> 00:04:22,460
the third Sacred Stone

44
00:04:22,580 --> 00:04:24,030
is in Mo Xiao's hands.

45
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:26,540
Go on.

46
00:04:28,350 --> 00:04:29,420
If the third Sacred Stone

47
00:04:29,420 --> 00:04:31,660
hadn't fallen into Sword Sovereign Fengyue's hands

48
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,060
and ended up with Mo Xiao,

49
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,980
how could he have walked through our forbidden grounds

50
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:36,210
like it was nothing?

51
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,390
Your analysis makes sense.

52
00:04:43,100 --> 00:04:46,320
If you weren't concerned about the Sacred Stone being in Mo Xiao's hands,

53
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:47,870
then why would Mo Xiao and the Shushan Sect

54
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:49,180
repeatedly violate our Mount Suyu,

55
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:51,180
even destroy our sacred artifact, the Suyu Cauldron,

56
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,080
yet you never put him in any real danger,

57
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:54,460
nor sent a single soldier,

58
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:57,790
allowing the Immortal Sect of Shushan to retreat unharmed?

59
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:59,000
I see.

60
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,330
You're blaming me

61
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:02,420
for not avenging Yeyuan.

62
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:07,540
Let me offer you some advice:

63
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,380
To accomplish great things,

64
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:12,580
one must be patient.

65
00:05:13,820 --> 00:05:16,010
One day, I'll show you

66
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,940
how I'll avenge Yeyuan,

67
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,180
reclaim his bloodline,

68
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,060
and bring about an unprecedented

69
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:26,700
golden age for the Heavenly Demon Sect.

70
00:05:28,100 --> 00:05:30,620
I, Chongguang, have ambitions far beyond Mount Suyu.

71
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:33,550
If you insist on judging me by your narrow standards,

72
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:37,580
you'll be the one to lose in the end.

73
00:05:40,860 --> 00:05:44,260
Don't tell me you actually know where Yeyuan's bloodline is?

74
00:05:49,580 --> 00:05:50,710
You know where he is,

75
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,690
don't you?

76
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:54,390
Then tell me, where is he?

77
00:05:55,340 --> 00:05:56,590
Say it.

78
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,600
Speak up.

79
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,250
Tell me.

80
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:03,670
Tell me, where is he?

81
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,110
Say something.

82
00:06:05,140 --> 00:06:07,100
Speak! Tell me!

83
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,380
Speak!

84
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,130
Tell me!

85
00:06:15,940 --> 00:06:19,020
I never cared about the Sacred Stone.

86
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:22,020
I never wanted to be the Demon Lord.

87
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,660
All I ever wanted was to find my son.

88
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:27,860
For these 18 years,

89
00:06:27,860 --> 00:06:29,790
-I've never heard of him.
-Guards!

90
00:06:29,820 --> 00:06:32,220
Escort Star Lord Xuyuan back to the palace.

91
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:34,700
Throw Star Lord Ji into the Demon Prison.

92
00:06:34,750 --> 00:06:37,090
-I beg you, please tell me where he is.
-Yes.

93
00:06:37,090 --> 00:06:38,260
Chongguang.

94
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:39,700
Tell me where he is.

95
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:41,310
I'm begging you, please.

96
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:42,590
Chongguang!

97
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:43,800
Chongguang!

98
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,680
Chongguang!

99
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:48,450
Chongguang!

100
00:07:04,490 --> 00:07:05,350
Tired?

101
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:07,760
Drunk.

102
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:11,090
Mo Xiao,

103
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:13,900
have you ever thought that

104
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:17,840
if you weren't in the Shushan Sect,

105
00:07:18,530 --> 00:07:20,790
but just a child from an ordinary family,

106
00:07:22,850 --> 00:07:24,150
what would you be like?

107
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:29,580
I'm not sure.

108
00:07:30,270 --> 00:07:31,310
I don't know

109
00:07:31,340 --> 00:07:34,000
what children from ordinary families are like.

110
00:07:34,690 --> 00:07:36,630
You'd grow up with natural grace and elegance,

111
00:07:36,630 --> 00:07:38,630
blessed with innate intelligence.

112
00:07:39,210 --> 00:07:41,000
By the time you turn 13,

113
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:44,020
matchmakers would already come calling,

114
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:47,680
offering a gentle, clever young lady for your hand.

115
00:07:48,860 --> 00:07:51,409
After passing the imperial examination

116
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,340
and bringing honor to your family,

117
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,620
you'd hold a grand wedding,

118
00:07:58,409 --> 00:08:00,350
and from then on, you and your wife would live in harmony

119
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,260
supporting each other through every trial.

120
00:08:02,260 --> 00:08:05,390
Together, you'd raise a pair of well-behaved children,

121
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:07,930
and enjoy a life free of worries,

122
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:09,910
filled with peace and joy.

123
00:08:28,590 --> 00:08:29,290
Lixue.

124
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:33,929
After I fulfill my mission as the Sword Sovereign,

125
00:08:33,929 --> 00:08:35,049
I'll take you

126
00:08:35,350 --> 00:08:37,270
to find a place with mountains, rivers, and fields.

127
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:38,169
We'll farm and weave,

128
00:08:38,169 --> 00:08:39,020
watch the tides by the river,

129
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:40,130
sit and watch the clouds rise,

130
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:41,730
and live this life carefree.

131
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:43,820
No.

132
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:47,310
I don't want the future.

133
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,650
I only want the present.

134
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:08,190
Alright.

135
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,820
Let's cherish every moment.

136
00:09:29,670 --> 00:09:30,600
Back then,

137
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,990
we brought Wu Chen here to find Shi Bujiu

138
00:09:33,100 --> 00:09:35,030
to cure her strange cold syndrome.

139
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:37,370
We saw her only as innocent and pure,

140
00:09:37,370 --> 00:09:38,490
naive and lovable.

141
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,670
But unexpectedly,

142
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,040
she turned out to be a pawn placed by Chongguang.

143
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,600
She deceived us for so long.

144
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:45,510
Her memories, from that time,

145
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:46,350
were sealed away

146
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:48,810
within the consciousness of the Phoenix-masked Woman.

147
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:49,770
She is Wu Chen.

148
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:51,450
It can't really be considered deception.

149
00:09:51,450 --> 00:09:53,040
But I can tell that

150
00:09:53,170 --> 00:09:55,810
Mo Xiao hopes she is Wu Chen,

151
00:09:55,840 --> 00:09:57,040
forever and always.

152
00:09:59,330 --> 00:10:00,410
I guess when Mo Xiao

153
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,290
took her away from Mang Mountain,

154
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,260
he already knew she was Lixue.

155
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,940
Those two were truly destined for a tragic love,

156
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:09,070
one that spanned from their past life.

157
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,610
I wonder

158
00:10:11,630 --> 00:10:13,150
how they're doing now.

159
00:10:14,630 --> 00:10:15,380
Oh, right,

160
00:10:15,720 --> 00:10:16,970
have you been using the Pagoda Bell recently

161
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,990
to track Mo Xiao's whereabouts?

162
00:10:17,990 --> 00:10:19,140
Did he manage to escape from those demon soldiers?

163
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,330
No need for your hindsight.

164
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:21,940
I've already patrolled the area.

165
00:10:21,940 --> 00:10:24,540
The demon soldiers are searching everywhere.

166
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:26,200
The strange thing is,

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,870
my Pagoda Bell can't locate

168
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:29,360
Mo Xiao's spiritual aura.

169
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:31,120
I suppose

170
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,170
he must have taken Lixue

171
00:10:33,190 --> 00:10:34,650
and hidden her somewhere.

172
00:10:35,730 --> 00:10:37,110
With the demon soldiers patrolling,

173
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,980
he must have concealed his spiritual aura.

174
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:41,850
It's only natural that my Pagoda Bell can't locate him for now.

175
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:42,850
That makes sense.

176
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:45,290
As long as they leave the mountain

177
00:10:45,290 --> 00:10:46,650
and escape from the Heavenly Demon Sect,

178
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:48,730
no demon soldiers can harm them.

179
00:10:51,610 --> 00:10:52,400
Oh no.

180
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:53,990
Do you think your father's Pagoda Bell

181
00:10:53,990 --> 00:10:55,730
could be more powerful than yours?

182
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:57,690
What if he finds Mo Xiao's whereabouts first?

183
00:10:57,690 --> 00:10:59,850
Then our lie would be exposed, wouldn't it?

184
00:10:59,850 --> 00:11:01,430
Don't underestimate my Pagoda Bell.

185
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:03,230
If my Pagoda Bell can't find something,

186
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:04,740
my father certainly won't be able to either.

187
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:05,400
That's great!

188
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:07,460
The Pagoda Bell is the most powerful.

189
00:11:07,770 --> 00:11:08,420
No, wait.

190
00:11:09,290 --> 00:11:10,820
Our Young Master Jing

191
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:12,270
is the most powerful.

192
00:11:13,850 --> 00:11:14,540
Alright,

193
00:11:14,650 --> 00:11:17,130
right now we should think carefully

194
00:11:17,250 --> 00:11:19,200
about how to play this act well.

195
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,730
What act?

196
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:24,690
Shushan Sect will definitely send someone here.

197
00:11:24,690 --> 00:11:26,150
With just our words alone,

198
00:11:26,170 --> 00:11:27,810
we certainly won't be able to fool them.

199
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:28,530
So,

200
00:11:28,550 --> 00:11:30,080
we need to put on a good show.

201
00:11:30,410 --> 00:11:31,170
Well,

202
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,540
what should we do?

203
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:38,820
(Peach Blossom Wine)

204
00:11:52,230 --> 00:11:53,180
How is it?

205
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:56,840
This is the best wine from Peach Blossom Village.

206
00:11:56,990 --> 00:11:58,150
I'm being generous, aren't I?

207
00:11:58,150 --> 00:11:59,550
That's very kind, very kind indeed.

208
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:01,210
You're absolutely generous.

209
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:03,530
But listen, girl,

210
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,340
let me be clear.

211
00:12:05,370 --> 00:12:08,040
I came here because of the signal we agreed on,

212
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,640
to keep our appointment.

213
00:12:09,710 --> 00:12:11,710
It's not like some people might say,

214
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:13,800
that I'm here just for your fine wine.

215
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:15,780
Of course.

216
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:16,930
You

217
00:12:16,950 --> 00:12:18,670
came for our friendship,

218
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,950
so as a token of gratitude,

219
00:12:19,950 --> 00:12:21,740
I must offer you the finest wine.

220
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:22,410
Indeed.

221
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,320
Unlike some,

222
00:12:24,430 --> 00:12:26,370
who are young and immature

223
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,500
and don't know how to speak properly.

224
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:28,990
Let's not stoop to their level.

225
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:29,750
Right.

226
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:31,110
You're right, girl.

227
00:12:31,330 --> 00:12:32,970
I don't have time

228
00:12:33,010 --> 00:12:35,210
to waste on such people.

229
00:12:47,070 --> 00:12:47,810
What's wrong?

230
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:48,850
Did something happen?

231
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:50,570
Lu Jianchuan has come to Peach Blossom Village.

232
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:51,170
Great.

233
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:53,430
Since we have an audience,

234
00:12:53,450 --> 00:12:54,680
let's start

235
00:12:55,210 --> 00:12:56,210
our performance.

236
00:13:08,470 --> 00:13:09,310
What are you laughing at?

237
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:10,170
Come back here!

238
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,550
Hurry up.

239
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,530
I think

240
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,490
Senior Lu is already getting suspicious.

241
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,090
If you don't cooperate properly,

242
00:13:19,090 --> 00:13:20,330
our little act

243
00:13:20,530 --> 00:13:21,660
will fall apart.

244
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,630
Tangled up like this,

245
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:29,330
I'm afraid even if his father came,

246
00:13:29,330 --> 00:13:30,890
he wouldn't recognize him.

247
00:13:32,570 --> 00:13:33,610
Your Senior Lu

248
00:13:33,730 --> 00:13:35,590
definitely won't be able to tell.

249
00:13:40,840 --> 00:13:43,100
You may now step into the medicinal bath.

250
00:13:47,770 --> 00:13:48,610
It's sweet.

251
00:13:50,630 --> 00:13:51,450
Here he comes.

252
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:05,040
Thank you for your tireless efforts, Divine Healer,

253
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:06,620
in treating our Young Sect Leader.

254
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:08,940
On behalf of my Master and fellow disciples of the Shushan Sect,

255
00:14:08,940 --> 00:14:11,540
I express our gratitude to you, Divine Healer.

256
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:13,970
Who might this person be?

257
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:16,810
One who can represent your Shushan Sect's leader

258
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:18,560
and its disciples

259
00:14:18,930 --> 00:14:21,990
must be quite a prominent figure in Shushan, I presume.

260
00:14:22,270 --> 00:14:25,530
This is the top disciple of the Luntian Branch from the Shushan Sect,

261
00:14:25,530 --> 00:14:27,410
Lu Jianchuan, Senior Lu.

262
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,810
So, you're the top disciple of the Luntian Branch.

263
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:35,070
I apologize for the earlier disrespect.

264
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,180
Alright.

265
00:14:41,350 --> 00:14:42,690
May I ask, Divine Healer,

266
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,650
what is the condition of the Young Sect Leader?

267
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,090
As for your Young Sect Leader's condition,

268
00:14:50,210 --> 00:14:51,470
it's difficult to say.

269
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:54,030
If all the necessary medicinal ingredients are gathered,

270
00:14:54,030 --> 00:14:55,430
perhaps in seven days,

271
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,240
he could make a full recovery.

272
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:00,260
But if the ingredients are incomplete,

273
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,170
there's a risk

274
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:04,030
he might fall into a deep, endless sleep.

275
00:15:04,050 --> 00:15:05,850
It's hard to say.

276
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,900
What exactly does the Young Sect Leader need?

277
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:12,850
The Baicao Branch of our Shushan Sect has a wide range of herbs from all over the world,

278
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,050
and our collection is quite extensive.

279
00:15:15,490 --> 00:15:16,930
Are you implying that

280
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,180
you don't trust my medical expertise?

281
00:15:19,890 --> 00:15:20,750
Fine then.

282
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,010
Why don't you take your Young Sect Leader

283
00:15:22,010 --> 00:15:23,650
back to your Baicao Branch for treatment?

284
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:25,290
Take him away, go on!

285
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:27,850
Divine Healer, please don't be angry.

286
00:15:27,850 --> 00:15:30,830
Senior Lu is simply concerned about the Young Sect Leader's condition.

287
00:15:30,830 --> 00:15:31,910
Yes, Divine Healer.

288
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:33,340
The reason for my visit is

289
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:35,030
to inquire about the Young Sect Leader's condition.

290
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:36,210
If I don't get a clear understanding,

291
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:39,140
it will be difficult for me to report back to Shushan.

292
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,770
So, you're implying that

293
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:44,540
if I explain things clearly,

294
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,530
you'll be able to understand?

295
00:15:49,640 --> 00:15:50,940
Well, Divine Healer,

296
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:52,970
how about

297
00:15:53,150 --> 00:15:55,380
allowing my senior to take a look?

298
00:15:57,010 --> 00:15:58,040
Just one quick glance,

299
00:15:58,040 --> 00:15:59,770
so he can report back properly.

300
00:16:04,410 --> 00:16:05,330
Alright then,

301
00:16:05,490 --> 00:16:07,460
but it must be brief.

302
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,610
However, I must make it clear:

303
00:16:09,610 --> 00:16:10,990
No opening any windows or doors.

304
00:16:10,990 --> 00:16:13,150
Otherwise, you could endanger your Young Sect Leader.

305
00:16:13,150 --> 00:16:15,350
If anything goes wrong, don't blame me.

306
00:16:16,130 --> 00:16:17,970
Of course.

307
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,740
The medicine room is so tightly sealed,

308
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:38,980
yet the medicinal scent still leaks out.

309
00:16:38,980 --> 00:16:40,730
Now you understand, Senior Lu,

310
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:43,740
why the Divine Healer doesn't allow outsiders near.

311
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:45,420
I understand.

312
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,619
I, Jianchuan, pay my respects to the Divine Healer.

313
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,310
Divine Healer,

314
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:22,780
I see that Mo Xiao's injuries are so severe.

315
00:17:22,780 --> 00:17:26,140
No wonder he came to you for treatment instead of returning to Shushan Sect.

316
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,849
Shushan Sect is in a time of turmoil.

317
00:17:27,849 --> 00:17:29,700
Divine Healer, thank you once again for your help.

318
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:31,680
I, Jianchuan, am truly grateful.

319
00:17:33,040 --> 00:17:35,040
Don't come at me with such nonsense.

320
00:17:36,490 --> 00:17:37,610
I came to save him

321
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,290
because I made a promise to that little girl to help.

322
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:42,690
It has nothing to do with your Shushan Sect.

323
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:44,280
Divine Healer,

324
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:45,820
I came this time

325
00:17:45,980 --> 00:17:47,230
to ask for one more favor.

326
00:17:47,230 --> 00:17:48,210
A favor?

327
00:17:49,890 --> 00:17:51,750
What is it that you're asking for?

328
00:17:51,830 --> 00:17:54,690
I'm just an old man with some knowledge of medicine.

329
00:17:54,790 --> 00:17:56,750
If you're looking for medical advice,

330
00:17:56,750 --> 00:17:59,240
it really depends on my mood.

331
00:18:04,040 --> 00:18:04,900
Divine Healer,

332
00:18:05,470 --> 00:18:07,400
this is the Vitality Herb from the Shushan Sect.

333
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:11,460
It is the most sought-after catalyst for medicinal alchemy in the world.

334
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:18,700
It really is the Vitality Herb.

335
00:18:22,990 --> 00:18:24,650
What is it that you want to ask?

336
00:18:25,770 --> 00:18:26,790
I want to ask,

337
00:18:26,970 --> 00:18:29,700
if the Rootless Flower poison from Mount Suyu

338
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:31,570
has deeply penetrated the body,

339
00:18:31,570 --> 00:18:34,830
is there any effective method to eradicate it completely?

340
00:18:36,450 --> 00:18:38,690
You're giving such a valuable gift

341
00:18:38,860 --> 00:18:40,390
just to inquire about this?

342
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:52,860
As for the Rootless Flower from Mount Suyu,

343
00:18:52,910 --> 00:18:54,390
its pistil contains the poison,

344
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:56,600
while its stem sap serves as the antidote.

345
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,370
Even if the antidote is taken,

346
00:18:58,390 --> 00:18:59,420
the lingering toxin

347
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,610
will take 49 days

348
00:19:01,630 --> 00:19:03,510
to fully leave the body.

349
00:19:06,760 --> 00:19:07,760
If

350
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:10,940
the demonic poison from the Heavenly Demon Sect

351
00:19:11,510 --> 00:19:13,370
has deeply infiltrated the body,

352
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,250
is there any effective remedy?

353
00:19:19,210 --> 00:19:22,410
Divine Healer, are you curious why I'm asking about this?

354
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,630
A physician doesn't pry into personal matters.

355
00:19:26,630 --> 00:19:28,630
We only inquire about the symptoms.

356
00:19:30,650 --> 00:19:32,500
The Heavenly Demon Clan's demonic poison

357
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:34,000
has no medicinal cure.

358
00:19:34,020 --> 00:19:36,770
It can only be dispelled or suppressed through willpower,

359
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,370
or with the aid of righteous spiritual energy,

360
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:41,010
to expel the demonic poison

361
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:42,280
from the body.

362
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:45,320
The immortal sects also have soul-transferring methods,

363
00:19:45,320 --> 00:19:47,030
but these are beyond the scope of medical practices.

364
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:48,830
I shouldn't say more about that.

365
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,590
I've asked all the necessary questions.

366
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,440
The Young Sect Leader's injuries are now in your hands, Divine Healer.

367
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,000
I will take my leave now.

368
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,630
Fortunately, the demonic poison can still be suppressed.

369
00:20:28,630 --> 00:20:30,490
Before Master and Mo Xiao recover,

370
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:33,220
I must find a way to eliminate the demonic poison.

371
00:20:39,060 --> 00:20:40,780
Now, the acting is done.

372
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:42,470
Come on.

373
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,700
Open it up.

374
00:20:44,720 --> 00:20:45,280
Alright.

375
00:20:45,310 --> 00:20:47,490
Let me untie it for you.

376
00:20:48,790 --> 00:20:50,510
It's open.

377
00:20:53,110 --> 00:20:54,070
Xie Lingyun?

378
00:20:57,340 --> 00:20:58,310
Xie Lingyun!

379
00:20:58,940 --> 00:20:59,780
Xie Lingyun!

380
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:01,440
Wake up.

381
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:02,880
Wake up.

382
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:05,170
Wake up.

383
00:21:09,430 --> 00:21:10,490
What are you doing?

384
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:12,810
I'm checking if you're still alive.

385
00:21:12,850 --> 00:21:13,730
Just now, I...

386
00:21:14,500 --> 00:21:16,150
I could barely breathe,

387
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,950
almost thinking I'd die in that medicine vat.

388
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:21,000
Can you believe it? Me, the young master of Tielyv Branch,

389
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,860
instead of fighting demons and monsters,

390
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:24,670
pretending to be a patient

391
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:26,890
and almost dying in a medicine vat.

392
00:21:27,100 --> 00:21:28,540
If this gets out,

393
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,130
I'll be the laughingstock.

394
00:21:30,270 --> 00:21:32,730
Alright.

395
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:35,020
Isn't this your own crazy idea?

396
00:21:35,040 --> 00:21:36,460
Exactly.

397
00:21:37,870 --> 00:21:38,730
Divine Healer,

398
00:21:38,730 --> 00:21:41,240
what did Senior Lu ask you just now?

399
00:21:41,260 --> 00:21:43,120
He didn't get suspicious, did he?

400
00:21:43,710 --> 00:21:45,400
I've already intervened.

401
00:21:45,430 --> 00:21:47,290
How could he have any reason to doubt?

402
00:21:47,290 --> 00:21:48,620
It's over.

403
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:52,770
Little girl,

404
00:21:52,790 --> 00:21:54,370
I've finished helping you.

405
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:56,390
I should be leaving now.

406
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,700
Leaving?

407
00:21:58,890 --> 00:22:00,750
What if Senior Lu comes back?

408
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:01,330
He?

409
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,290
He won't be coming back.

410
00:22:04,310 --> 00:22:05,640
Are you so sure?

411
00:22:05,670 --> 00:22:07,020
What he wanted to know

412
00:22:07,040 --> 00:22:08,270
has already been answered.

413
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,960
Of course, there's no need for him to come back.

414
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:10,790
Alright,

415
00:22:10,810 --> 00:22:11,740
I'm leaving now.

416
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,010
Bye.

417
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:13,760
Wait.

418
00:22:13,790 --> 00:22:15,130
I still have questions for you.

419
00:22:15,130 --> 00:22:15,770
Bye.

420
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:16,650
Divine Healer.

421
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:44,060
Supreme Lord.

422
00:22:46,750 --> 00:22:48,320
Haven't you found her yet?

423
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,110
Yes.

424
00:22:49,370 --> 00:22:50,570
The strange thing is,

425
00:22:50,710 --> 00:22:53,000
I can't sense her presence at all.

426
00:22:54,530 --> 00:22:55,330
Supreme Lord,

427
00:22:55,700 --> 00:22:57,680
that Ice Blue Moth is still inside Lixue's body.

428
00:22:57,680 --> 00:22:59,060
If Mo Xiao finds out,

429
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,300
he might use Lixue to harm you.

430
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:06,230
He won't do that.

431
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:06,960
Supreme Lord,

432
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,600
please give me a little more time.

433
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,460
I will definitely bring her back.

434
00:23:12,370 --> 00:23:13,090
Get out.

435
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:30,020
Lixue,

436
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:33,340
you've prepared so many delicious dishes.

437
00:24:33,370 --> 00:24:34,490
Wash your hands.

438
00:24:35,730 --> 00:24:36,650
Got it.

439
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:45,010
There's wine too.

440
00:24:58,020 --> 00:24:59,210
Before we drink,

441
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:01,200
shouldn't we offer a toast first?

442
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:02,930
You go ahead then.

443
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:05,540
I'll start.

444
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:06,510
Alright.

445
00:25:06,550 --> 00:25:07,640
Then let's toast to

446
00:25:07,680 --> 00:25:08,820
world peace

447
00:25:08,840 --> 00:25:10,170
and prosperity for all.

448
00:25:11,150 --> 00:25:11,790
Good.

449
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,110
It's your turn for the second toast.

450
00:25:29,450 --> 00:25:30,650
For the second toast,

451
00:25:30,670 --> 00:25:32,670
I wish that for the rest of your life,

452
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:38,730
you live without worries

453
00:25:38,890 --> 00:25:40,150
and find contentment.

454
00:26:05,630 --> 00:26:06,830
And for the third cup,

455
00:26:08,490 --> 00:26:09,340
I wish you

456
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:11,390
find your perfect match,

457
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,880
someone who will accompany you for a lifetime.

458
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,310
Lixue.

459
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,060
Lixue,

460
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:34,340
what's wrong with you?

461
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:44,840
Mo Xiao,

462
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,240
I think

463
00:26:48,460 --> 00:26:49,610
that's enough.

464
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,520
These three days

465
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:57,170
have been

466
00:26:58,630 --> 00:27:00,760
the happiest of my life.

467
00:27:04,910 --> 00:27:05,790
Honestly,

468
00:27:06,980 --> 00:27:09,040
I've never dared to hope for much,

469
00:27:10,110 --> 00:27:11,770
but it's so good that you came.

470
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:13,760
Lixue.

471
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,610
Thank you.

472
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,360
What are you talking about?

473
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:26,440
Since I was born,

474
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,550
I've lived inside an ice silkworm cocoon.

475
00:27:30,470 --> 00:27:31,820
Master saved me

476
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,400
and brought me to Mang Mountain,

477
00:27:34,910 --> 00:27:36,570
where I lived with snow foxes.

478
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,630
Before that,

479
00:27:40,290 --> 00:27:42,770
I never knew what it felt like to have a home.

480
00:27:43,670 --> 00:27:45,090
Until I met you.

481
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,440
You brought me down from Mang Mountain,

482
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:51,030
took me to Xuanqing Court,

483
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:53,940
and protected me in the Shushan Sect.

484
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,630
No matter where you are,

485
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:00,220
it feels like home.

486
00:28:01,270 --> 00:28:02,930
Later, I realized that

487
00:28:07,550 --> 00:28:08,650
wherever you are,

488
00:28:09,590 --> 00:28:11,080
that's where my home is.

489
00:28:15,410 --> 00:28:16,130
Lixue,

490
00:28:17,590 --> 00:28:18,540
from now on,

491
00:28:21,340 --> 00:28:22,540
I will always be here.

492
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:26,710
Now,

493
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:30,480
we finally have a home of our own.

494
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:31,970
Mo Xiao,

495
00:28:33,390 --> 00:28:35,520
you won't forget this place, will you?

496
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:42,580
Silly girl,

497
00:28:43,280 --> 00:28:45,280
of course I won't forget this place.

498
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,110
But one day,

499
00:28:47,410 --> 00:28:48,350
we will build

500
00:28:48,370 --> 00:28:50,130
a home that truly belongs to us.

501
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:58,470
Don't forget,

502
00:28:59,450 --> 00:29:01,890
that Mo Xiao is neither a disciple of the Sword Sovereign

503
00:29:01,890 --> 00:29:04,420
nor the Young Sect Leader of the Shushan Sect.

504
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:14,230
He has a secluded courtyard in the bustling city

505
00:29:14,740 --> 00:29:17,470
and a wife who has been his childhood sweetheart.

506
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:24,170
They live in harmony, supporting each other through every trial.

507
00:29:24,170 --> 00:29:27,270
They will have two clever and adorable children.

508
00:29:32,350 --> 00:29:35,090
From then on, they will enjoy a life free of worries,

509
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,550
filled with peace and joy.

510
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:54,040
Lixue,

511
00:29:55,510 --> 00:29:56,310
rest assured.

512
00:29:57,600 --> 00:30:00,200
I will definitely give you the life you desire.

513
00:30:06,990 --> 00:30:07,740
Lixue,

514
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,290
this wine...

515
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:15,390
Mo Xiao,

516
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,180
these three days I've had

517
00:30:20,590 --> 00:30:22,170
are enough.

518
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:27,840
In this lifetime,

Lixue.

592
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,430
Master.

593
00:33:59,050 --> 00:34:01,050
Master.

594
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:03,180
Master.

595
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,210
Master.

596
00:34:20,350 --> 00:34:21,730
Hey girl,

597
00:34:23,150 --> 00:34:24,949
if you're truly fine,

598
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,300
I'll be leaving now.

599
00:34:29,380 --> 00:34:31,210
Senior Lu has already been here.

600
00:34:31,630 --> 00:34:33,350
Earlier, to deceive him,

601
00:34:33,510 --> 00:34:35,710
we had to make Lingyun appear like that.

602
00:34:36,260 --> 00:34:38,650
Now, I suppose the whole Shushan Sect

603
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:40,880
believes Mo Xiao is in imminent danger.

604
00:34:41,300 --> 00:34:42,719
It won't be long before

605
00:34:42,900 --> 00:34:45,610
my father and the Sect Leader arrive as well.

606
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,340
Senior Lu is easy to deceive,

607
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,800
but the Sect Leader isn't.

608
00:34:48,909 --> 00:34:50,330
The most urgent matter now

609
00:34:50,330 --> 00:34:53,260
is to find Mo Xiao's whereabouts as soon as possible.

610
00:34:58,370 --> 00:34:59,240
Take care.

611
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,170
Girl,

612
00:35:14,930 --> 00:35:16,790
do you really not need my help?

613
00:35:16,890 --> 00:35:17,740
No need.

614
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,230
I've already troubled you enough with this trip.

615
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,900
Don't worry about what's coming next.

616
00:35:20,900 --> 00:35:22,430
Lingyun and I can handle it.

617
00:35:23,540 --> 00:35:24,500
Girl,

618
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:26,700
after we part today

619
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,790
who knows

620
00:35:28,810 --> 00:35:30,990
when we'll meet again.

621
00:35:32,290 --> 00:35:33,400
You old drunkard,

622
00:35:33,600 --> 00:35:35,320
Shushan Sect has good wine too.

623
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:36,810
If you want a drink,

624
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,500
come find me at Fengyu Branch.

625
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:43,680
If there's any 18-year-old Nu'er Hong,

626
00:35:43,790 --> 00:35:46,900
I will definitely come drink it.

627
00:35:49,430 --> 00:35:50,230
Alright then.

628
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:52,040
I'll take my leave now.

629
00:35:52,200 --> 00:35:53,580
I'm off

630
00:35:53,600 --> 00:35:56,390
to search for wine and gather herbs.

631
00:36:08,850 --> 00:36:11,270
Why Nu'er Hong?

632
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:14,360
He wants to drink your wedding wine.

633
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,570
Silly girl.

634
00:36:15,850 --> 00:36:17,650
Who are you calling a silly girl?

635
00:36:18,770 --> 00:36:19,880
What?

636
00:36:20,630 --> 00:36:22,020
Wedding wine?

637
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,020
See? Told you you're the silly one.

638
00:36:24,560 --> 00:36:26,010
You're the silly one!

639
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:32,590
Three Guardians?

640
00:36:42,850 --> 00:36:44,230
Why isn't the Young Sect Leader here?

641
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:45,060
Where is the Young Sect Leader?

642
00:36:45,060 --> 00:36:47,010
Didn't the Young Sect Leader sustain serious injuries and come here in search of the Divine Healer?

643
00:36:47,010 --> 00:36:48,510
Why isn't he here?

644
00:36:48,690 --> 00:36:49,810
Don't worry,

645
00:36:49,830 --> 00:36:52,030
I'll explain everything to you slowly.

646
00:37:04,140 --> 00:37:05,310
Young Master Xie,

647
00:37:05,340 --> 00:37:07,040
do you mean

648
00:37:07,060 --> 00:37:10,390
that the Young Sect Leader Senior Lu saw was you in disguise?

649
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:12,290
This is just a stalling tactic.

650
00:37:12,310 --> 00:37:14,440
We need to calm the elders of the Shushan Sect for now,

651
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,880
and then we'll find a way

652
00:37:15,910 --> 00:37:17,090
to locate your Young Sect Leader.

653
00:37:17,090 --> 00:37:17,990
That's right.

654
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,240
Do you know where he is now?

655
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,850
We don't either.

656
00:37:22,060 --> 00:37:24,120
We're still waiting to hear from him.

657
00:37:26,170 --> 00:37:26,890
Look.

658
00:37:26,910 --> 00:37:27,790
It's Floren.

659
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:31,690
Let's go.

660
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,770
We'll follow and see what's going on.

661
00:37:55,510 --> 00:37:56,400
Mo Xiao.

662
00:37:57,870 --> 00:38:00,070
Mo Xiao!

663
00:38:00,320 --> 00:38:01,080
Zisu,

664
00:38:01,110 --> 00:38:03,110
check and see what's wrong with him.

665
00:38:10,190 --> 00:38:11,510
The Young Sect Leader has been drugged.

666
00:38:11,510 --> 00:38:12,570
However, he's not seriously injured.

667
00:38:12,570 --> 00:38:14,630
He's just temporarily unconscious.

668
00:38:14,820 --> 00:38:16,210
This place is so deserted.

669
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:18,010
How did the Young Sect Leader end up unconscious here?

670
00:38:18,010 --> 00:38:18,910
Let's take him back to Peach Blossom Village first.

671
00:38:18,910 --> 00:38:20,710
We'll talk more once he wakes up.

672
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,890
If I had known,

673
00:38:36,010 --> 00:38:38,460
I never would've let that Divine Healer leave.

674
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,370
Young Master,

675
00:38:39,530 --> 00:38:41,610
I've already checked the pulse of the Young Sect Leader.

676
00:38:41,610 --> 00:38:43,230
He's just unconscious from the sedative.

677
00:38:43,230 --> 00:38:44,570
There's no serious harm.

678
00:38:44,570 --> 00:38:46,530
He should be waking up soon.

679
00:38:49,420 --> 00:38:50,420
Young Master Xie,

680
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:53,300
has the Young Sect Leader gone to Mount Suyu again?

681
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:56,860
Zisu,

682
00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:59,400
let's wait for the Young Sect Leader to regain consciousness.

683
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,340
Yes,

684
00:39:00,650 --> 00:39:02,330
he did go to Mount Suyu.

685
00:39:02,950 --> 00:39:04,140
As for everything else,

686
00:39:04,140 --> 00:39:06,070
we'll talk it over once he wakes up.

687
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:02,810
Master,

688
00:40:03,090 --> 00:40:04,170
I'm back.

689
00:40:06,780 --> 00:40:08,590
Why did you come back alone?

690
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:09,770
Yes,

691
00:40:10,320 --> 00:40:11,400
I came back alone.

692
00:40:14,790 --> 00:40:16,180
If you'd already left,

693
00:40:16,690 --> 00:40:17,930
why did you come back?

694
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,020
Master once said,

695
00:40:20,220 --> 00:40:21,620
my life belongs to you.

696
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:24,440
I haven't repaid your kindness yet,

697
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:26,210
so of course, I couldn't leave.

698
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:31,640
You understand that now?

699
00:40:32,570 --> 00:40:34,280
I've always understood that.

700
00:40:35,870 --> 00:40:36,580
Good.

701
00:40:37,780 --> 00:40:39,250
Since you understand,

702
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:41,820
go back to your Shaohao Palace and rest well.

703
00:40:42,130 --> 00:40:43,600
Our wedding ceremony

704
00:40:43,700 --> 00:40:45,100
is still waiting for you.

705
00:41:03,590 --> 00:41:04,390
Supreme Lord,

706
00:41:04,700 --> 00:41:07,420
Feng Lixue betrayed you and secretly fled down the mountain.

707
00:41:07,420 --> 00:41:09,000
Now she has inexplicably returned.

708
00:41:09,000 --> 00:41:10,690
She must have some ulterior motive.

709
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,390
You should punish her harshly for her

710
00:41:12,390 --> 00:41:13,990
to set an example for others.

711
00:41:17,900 --> 00:41:19,110
Feng Lixue

712
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:21,680
will soon become my Supreme Consort.

713
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:24,570
If you don't learn to speak properly,

714
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:26,960
I'll make you disappear immediately.

715
00:41:29,620 --> 00:41:32,240
Send the new gown to the Supreme Consort.

716
00:41:33,860 --> 00:41:34,740
Yes.
