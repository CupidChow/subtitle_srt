4
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:33,740
Everyone,

5
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:36,020
I'd like to say hello to you all.

6
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:38,430
After knowing that the chief had passed away,

7
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:41,060
our Su Family came here overnight to pay our respects.

8
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:44,380
I wanted to console the chief

9
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,860
in the mourning hall that

10
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,420
he didn't need to worry about the things after he passed away,

11
00:01:48,979 --> 00:01:50,190
but I didn't expect that

12
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:52,380
the succession to the position of chief

13
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,180
would cause a misunderstanding.

14
00:01:55,460 --> 00:01:56,860
Though Chong is young,

15
00:01:57,220 --> 00:01:58,860
he has a solid foundation

16
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:01,180
with superb martial arts skills and great talent.

17
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,580
He's a rare genius.

18
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:06,940
Besides, Chong has always been prudent to do everything,

19
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,220
and was carefully educated by the chief.

20
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:10,500
I believe

21
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:12,540
if he becomes the Chief of the Martial Arts World,

22
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,970
under his management,

23
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:15,140
the Martial Arts World will

24
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:16,740
have a broad and bright prospect

25
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,380
and make progress.

26
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,430
Chong,

27
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,660
don't worry.

28
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,900
I'm here.

29
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:24,329

and my father's expectations.

47
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,100
Don't get carried away too soon.

to guard the chief's coffin.

77
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,220
But the chief treated me well.

78
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:29,580

I'm begging you, Xi.

Before your father died,

87
00:04:58,940 --> 00:04:59,450
he didn't even tell you

88
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:01,260
the whereabouts of the manual.

89
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:02,250
I asked Qing Tong

90
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,620
to search the whole mansion.

91
00:05:04,330 --> 00:05:06,270
He even went to the back mountain.

92
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:08,300
But there was no clue.

93
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:10,470
It really makes me so angry.

Mother.

95
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:15,850
In fact, you don't have to

96
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:17,590
blame my father for the manual.

97
00:05:18,300 --> 00:05:18,930
The Shanhai Secret Manual

98
00:05:18,930 --> 00:05:20,220
can't be practiced by ordinary people.

99
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:22,180
My father didn't give it to me.

100
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:24,060
Maybe it was for my own good.

101
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,750
The Shanhai Secret Manual

102
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,060
can't be practiced by ordinary people indeed.

103
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,220
But are you an ordinary person?

104
00:05:32,620 --> 00:05:33,770
You're a rare genius of martial arts

105
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,020
in a century.

106
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:37,890
If you get the Shanhai Secret Manual,

107
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:39,940
you'll become the second Cheng Qianyi.

108
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,540
So you must get

109
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:44,070
this manual.

110
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:46,430
However,

111
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,190
you've just succeeded to the position of chief.

112
00:05:50,060 --> 00:05:51,670
Currently, there are many things

113
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,150
which you need to deal with.

114
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:54,500
So,

115
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:56,620
now you can't be distracted

116
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:58,340
by looking for the manual.

117
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,220
Today,

118
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:02,340
if it weren't for your Uncle Huai

119
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,270
and the Su Family's power,

120
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:05,990
those several old men

121
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,700
wouldn't have yielded to you,

122
00:06:09,140 --> 00:06:11,190
especially Murong Yu.

123
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,170
Therefore, we must

124
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:15,340
try our best

125
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,510
to eliminate him.

126
00:06:18,290 --> 00:06:19,490
Murong Yu has been ambitious

127
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:20,580
for a long time.

128
00:06:21,420 --> 00:06:22,660
He was afraid of my father,

129
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,070
so he acted humbly.

130
00:06:25,140 --> 00:06:26,790
After I secure the position of chief,

131
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,260
there will be

132
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:30,290
no place for Murong Yu

133
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:31,390
to stay on Mount Shengyue.

134
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:32,870
By the way,

135
00:06:34,100 --> 00:06:35,150
the fake Zhuwan

136
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:36,490
saw the whole process of blood exchange

137
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,020
between you and the real Zhuwan.

138
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,030
Now that your father has passed away,

139
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:42,040
there is no reason for her

140
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:43,700
to live in this world.

141
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:47,330
If she reveals

142
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:48,390
that secret,

143
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,620
your reputation will be damaged.

144
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,260
Those old foxes

145
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:54,110
will make a big deal out of it.

146
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,460
In my opinion,

147
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:59,110
you should find a chance

148
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,030
to eliminate her.

149
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:04,630

To save me.

151
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:06,930
you've made the real Zhuwan

152
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:07,890
die innocently.

153
00:07:07,890 --> 00:07:09,260
I don't want to kill a person anymore.

154
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,060
Do you

155
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:15,020
have feelings for her?

you are the Chief of the Martial Arts World.

You're also

159

the heir of our Murong Family.

160
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:28,750
If you fall in love with her,

161
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:30,900
it won't work out between you.

your biological daughter,

167

for a period of time,

169
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,740

00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,210
don't you need to

180

have as many of them as you can as a girl?

181
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:15,850
I can't let others' daughters

182

look more resplendent than my daughter.

183

I'm sorry, Father.

I'm sorry, Father.

190

Zhuwan.

193
00:09:15,340 --> 00:09:16,900
I came to Mount Shengyue when I was eight.

194
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:19,110
He treated me very well,

195
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:20,700
and regarded me like his own son.

196
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:23,110
But I didn't expect that

197
00:09:24,460 --> 00:09:26,180
he would pass away so suddenly.

198
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,860
I didn't even get the chance to repay him.

199
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:33,020
Zhuwan.

200
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:35,070
I'm sorry for your loss.

201
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:44,020
Hong.

202
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,220
Zhuwan.

203
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,190
Auntie.

204
00:09:50,770 --> 00:09:52,620
Hong, it's getting late.

205
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,140
Go back and rest.

206
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:56,110
I need to talk to Zhuwan.

207
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,130
Do you really take yourself

208
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,900
as the young lady of Murong Mansion?

209
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:16,670
You're so indulged in this role.

210
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,030
Your Ladyship,

211
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,340
you've worried too much.

212
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,130
I just want to

213
00:10:21,130 --> 00:10:22,260
guard the chief's coffin here,

214
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:24,540
and thank him for taking care of me.

215
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,340
Meanwhile, I want to apologize to him.

216
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:28,980
Moreover,

217
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,700
in the eyes of the outsiders,

218
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,780
I'm his daughter.

219
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:34,620
If I don't guard his coffin,

220
00:10:34,740 --> 00:10:36,540
it'll only make others gossip and bring trouble.

221
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:39,820
If I need to act,

222
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:42,550
I should act well, right?

223
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:45,180
You'd better

224
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,750
not let me see you again tomorrow.

225
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:49,270
Besides,

226
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,810
don't act in the name of

227
00:10:51,810 --> 00:10:53,740
Mount Shengyue's Murong Family.

228
00:10:54,380 --> 00:10:55,660
Otherwise,

229
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:58,740
I'll definitely make you disappear completely.

230
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:14,450
[Memorial Tablet of Beloved Father Murong Zhu, Established by His Son Murong Chong]

231
00:11:40,490 --> 00:11:41,100
Everyone,

232
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:43,620
in my opinion,

233
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,350
after the late chief's funeral,

234
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,810
we should hold

235
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:49,420
the Succession Ceremony for the new chief immediately.

236
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,780
The case of the extermination of the Xie Family

237
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,500
should also be investigated as soon as possible.

238
00:11:54,020 --> 00:11:54,660
Otherwise,

239
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,950
there will be no leader in the Martial Arts World.

240
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:58,630
If the investigation is delayed,

241
00:11:58,900 --> 00:12:00,310
and something wrong happens again,

242
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,430
the Martial Arts World will hardly be peaceful.

243
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,670
What do you all think?

244
00:12:09,980 --> 00:12:11,430
That's why

245
00:12:12,100 --> 00:12:14,420
when all the previous chiefs succeeded to the position,

246
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,360
they would accept

247
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,660
the challenges of the heroes of all sects.

248
00:12:18,220 --> 00:12:19,580
This is not easy

249
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,180
for Chong.

250
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:24,230
We need to prepare carefully.

251
00:12:26,860 --> 00:12:27,940
Thank you for your concern, Uncle Yu.

252
00:12:28,610 --> 00:12:30,180
I hope by that time,

253
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:33,070
you'll cheer for me actively.

254
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,310
Of course.

255
00:12:46,250 --> 00:12:52,760
[Mourn]

256
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:04,620
Why are you still here?

257
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:08,390
You haven't told me about my origin.

258
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:10,510
Your origin is in Jian'an City.

259
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,020
Your Ladyship.

260
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:33,010
Can't you

261
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,220
tell me more information?

262
00:13:36,780 --> 00:13:38,430
That's all I know.

263
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,620
Don't force me to hit you.

264
00:13:40,980 --> 00:13:43,670
If you're smart enough, you should leave now.

265
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,020
Sir.

266
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:03,180
Ginseng soup.

267
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:04,910
Put it there.

268
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:09,950
Take a rest.

269
00:14:14,580 --> 00:14:15,500
Those old foxes

270
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,510
are hard to deal with.

271
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,540
It seems that my Uncle Huai tries to help me,

272
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:21,660
but he actually has his own plan.

273
00:14:23,300 --> 00:14:24,010
If I don't figure out

274
00:14:24,010 --> 00:14:25,660
all their real intentions,

275
00:14:26,220 --> 00:14:28,470
it'll be difficult for us to do anything in the future.

276
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:31,830
By the way,

277
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,180
where's Zhuwan?

278
00:14:33,420 --> 00:14:33,940
Guarding the coffin.

279
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,790
All night.

280
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:37,940
I'm going to see her.

281
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,860
I feel sorry, too.

282
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,220
I feel sorry that

283
00:14:55,580 --> 00:14:56,900
I can't personally see you

284
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:59,260
marry a good man.

285
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:09,980
Chief Murong,

286
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:12,290
when I called you father,

287
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,630
I was sincere.

288
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,820
How I wish I could

289
00:15:15,820 --> 00:15:17,460
have a father like you.

290
00:15:18,340 --> 00:15:19,570
It was you who made me feel

291
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,750
what a home is like.

292
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:36,950
Father is gone now.

293
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,460
I'm going to leave here.

294
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:39,330
It's meaningless

295
00:15:39,330 --> 00:15:40,460
for me to stay here.

296
00:15:40,620 --> 00:15:41,940
Did my mother ask you to leave?

297
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,510
I don't want to cause you any trouble.

298
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:45,590
Zhuwan.

299
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,060
I promised you

300
00:15:49,380 --> 00:15:50,460
I would protect you.

301
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,620
Trust me, okay?

302
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:55,340
Stay here.

303
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,750
Actually, I'm so sad.

304
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:14,460
I feel sorry for your father.

305
00:17:23,619 --> 00:17:24,380
I've read

306
00:17:24,619 --> 00:17:25,460
both the books here

307
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:26,500
and the books in my study,

308
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,109
but there's no record about

309
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,740
the martial arts skills used for killing the Xie Family.

310
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:32,150
I even suspect

311
00:17:32,380 --> 00:17:33,190
that demon

312
00:17:33,500 --> 00:17:34,700
was the same person who committed murder

313
00:17:34,900 --> 00:17:36,220
that night at your birthday party.

314
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:36,970
Last night, I also

315
00:17:36,970 --> 00:17:38,020
checked the backgrounds of all the sects

316
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,020
in the Martial Arts World,

317
00:17:39,740 --> 00:17:40,280
but I didn't find

318
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,820
any clues about the murderer.

319
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:43,510
Maybe

320
00:17:44,540 --> 00:17:46,300
the martial arts skills which that demon practices

321
00:17:46,660 --> 00:17:48,340
have never been seen by you and me.

322
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,580
The Shanhai Secret Manual!

323
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,300
Did that demon

324
00:17:56,380 --> 00:17:58,260
really practice the skills in the Shanhai Secret Manual?

325
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,260
It's possible.

326
00:18:01,540 --> 00:18:02,830
If that's the case,

327
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,820
both of us

328
00:18:05,180 --> 00:18:06,590
are no match for him.

329
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:07,980
No.

330
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,210
I believe when Mr. Cheng Qianyi

331
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,940
created the Divine Skill of Shanhai,

332
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:13,210
he didn't take it

333
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:15,140
as a killing weapon during the practice of it.

334
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:18,810
Maybe what that demon practices

335
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,560
is not the real

336
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:20,420
Divine Skill of Shanhai.

337
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:22,010
We just need to find a chance

338
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:22,820
to fight with him.

339
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:24,670
Then we can find his flaws

340
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,790
and figure out a way to restrain him.

341
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:31,020
I wonder when he'll

342
00:18:31,380 --> 00:18:32,340
show up next time.

343
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,220
Now, I both

344
00:18:36,260 --> 00:18:37,670
want him to show up

345
00:18:38,620 --> 00:18:39,900
and are afraid of him showing up.

346
00:18:42,740 --> 00:18:43,260
Hong,

347
00:18:44,140 --> 00:18:45,140
you must be careful.

348
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,260
You're the one who should be careful.

349
00:18:48,340 --> 00:18:49,980
You've just become the Chief of the Martial Arts World.

350
00:18:50,180 --> 00:18:52,230
All those sects may not be convinced.

351
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:54,660
The Chief Master

352
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,390
also covets your position.

353
00:18:58,980 --> 00:18:59,660
Don't worry.

354
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,940
I've prepared for it.

355
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:22,030
No need to drive me away.

356
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,110
I'm leaving now.

357
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:25,980
It's good that you know what to do.

358
00:19:26,340 --> 00:19:27,170
Before I leave,

359
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:28,580
I want to ask you one more question.

360
00:19:30,660 --> 00:19:32,380
Have you ever seen my mother?

361
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:34,670
I don't remember.

362
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,140
Then where did you get the purse?

363
00:19:38,860 --> 00:19:39,820
I only know that

364
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:41,500
after she married into Jian'an City,

365
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:43,420
there has been no news about her.

366
00:19:43,700 --> 00:19:44,820
If you want to know,

367
00:19:45,220 --> 00:19:46,740
go to Jian'an City.

[Mourn]

369
00:20:12,650 --> 00:20:13,260
Father.

370
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:14,990
I'm such a bad son.

371
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:17,260
I'm late.

372
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:35,790
Wei.

373
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:38,110
Don't be too sad.

374
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:40,270
From now on, the Murong Family

375
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:42,310
needs your support.

376
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,070
Uncle Yu.

377
00:20:46,690 --> 00:20:47,320
I've heard that my brother

378
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,980
is going to succeed to the position after the funeral.

379
00:20:50,620 --> 00:20:51,260
Yes.

380
00:20:52,340 --> 00:20:53,980
He's very impatient.

381
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:57,230
My brother is thoughtful.

382
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,370
We should

383
00:20:59,370 --> 00:21:00,860
support him well.

384
00:21:08,060 --> 00:21:08,740

[Murong Mansion]

386
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,470
Now what I'm most worried about

387
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,380
is that the demon

388
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:45,570
will show up while you're

389
00:21:45,570 --> 00:21:46,780
so busy with the succession to the position of chief.

390
00:21:47,980 --> 00:21:49,620
That's also what I'm most scared of now.

391
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,780
So we can't just sit there without doing anything.

392
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,180
Master Fu.

393
00:21:53,460 --> 00:21:54,030
Bad news.

What did you say?

397
00:21:58,340 --> 00:22:00,020
Governor Fu is dead.

398
00:22:06,530 --> 00:22:07,340
How is that possible?

399
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,420
Governor Fu has always been in good health.

400
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:12,980
Is there a letter from my home?

401
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:14,220
It happened suddenly.

402
00:22:14,660 --> 00:22:16,270
There is no letter from Jian'an City.

403
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:17,620
They only sent an oral message.

404
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:19,830
Master Fu, please set off immediately.

405
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,420
I got it.

406
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:23,780

If you need my help,

409
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:33,750
don't bear the burden alone.

410
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:35,660
I'm at your disposal.

411
00:22:36,540 --> 00:22:37,820
I'll ask someone to send you back now.

412
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,700
No need.

00:22:39,420 --> 00:22:40,500
You have more things to do than me.

414
00:22:41,340 --> 00:22:43,390
How can you be distracted by worrying about my family affairs?

415
00:22:44,570 --> 00:22:45,940
I don't need anyone to protect me.

416
00:22:46,460 --> 00:22:47,790
I'll travel with light luggage alone.

417
00:22:48,260 --> 00:22:49,220
I can go faster in this way.

418
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:53,820
Okay.

419
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:56,700
Take care.

422
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,860
Why are you here again?

423
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,130
Before my father passed away,

424
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,580
he gave me this key.

425
00:23:32,180 --> 00:23:33,940

has left for you.

this is half of

The succession has been settled,

457
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:35,710
and it's approved by everybody.

458
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:37,450
You must work hard,

to fulfill my duty.

464
00:25:46,980 --> 00:25:48,780
I think the Succession Ceremony

465
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,250
should be held after His Lordship's

466
00:25:50,250 --> 00:25:51,100

In that case,

472
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:01,700
you should go back

to tell you.

When the new chief assumes his post,

480
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,370
he'll have to accept

481
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:27,190
challenges from all sects.

482
00:26:27,420 --> 00:26:29,070
If the new chief is defeated,

483
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,900
he'll have to give up the position of chief.

484
00:26:31,700 --> 00:26:32,270
So,

485
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:35,660
you must be extra careful that day.

486
00:26:36,020 --> 00:26:37,950
Not only will you have to be wary of outsiders,

487
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,660
but also be wary of your Uncle Yu

00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:40,830
and your brother.

489
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,150
Mother, don't worry.

490
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,100
I'm fully prepared.

491
00:26:45,700 --> 00:26:47,790
As long as you can get the Shanhai Secret Manual,

492
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,030
those people

493
00:26:49,420 --> 00:26:51,660
won't dare to be disloyal anymore.

494
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,270
So Chong,

495
00:26:53,620 --> 00:26:55,740
we need to find the manual as soon as possible.

496
00:26:56,020 --> 00:26:56,460
Yes.

497
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,140
Go.

498
00:27:10,660 --> 00:27:12,300
That's what happened.

499
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:14,510
I'm not the real Murong Zhuwan.

500
00:27:14,650 --> 00:27:16,290
Now that the chief has passed away,

501
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:18,030
my task is over.

502
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,310
It's time for me to end my acting.

503
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:23,860
I'm sorry for lying to you.

504
00:27:24,860 --> 00:27:26,140
I'm really happy that

505
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:27,910
you told me these things.

506
00:27:28,620 --> 00:27:29,780
I don't care who you are.

507
00:27:30,180 --> 00:27:31,420
Nor do I care about your identity.

508
00:27:32,260 --> 00:27:33,020
I only know that

509
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:34,870
I like you.

510
00:27:40,940 --> 00:27:41,610
Since you're also

511
00:27:41,610 --> 00:27:42,630
going to Jian'an City this time,

512
00:27:42,780 --> 00:27:44,580
why don't you go to the Fu Family with me?

513
00:27:45,420 --> 00:27:46,300
I'll ask someone to help you

514
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:47,310
investigate your origins,

515
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:49,300
and I'll protect you all your life.

516
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,460
Wei.

517
00:27:56,860 --> 00:27:57,620
Wait.

518
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,340
Wei!

519
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,500
Wait.

520
00:28:02,060 --> 00:28:02,740
Wei!

521
00:28:04,100 --> 00:28:05,150
Wait.

522
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:08,980
Uncle,

523
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:11,580
what can I do for you?

524
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,230
In my opinion,

525
00:28:24,380 --> 00:28:25,420
you are the most suitable person

526
00:28:25,540 --> 00:28:27,060
to be the chief.

527
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:28,910
You're the eldest son of the Murong Family,

528
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:30,350
and are kind-hearted.

529
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,740
You're also quite experienced.

530
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,820
Unfortunately, at the critical moment,

531
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:36,180
you were sent away with an excuse by Su.

532
00:28:36,860 --> 00:28:38,750
Otherwise, the position of chief would have been...

533
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:40,980
But I'm not gifted.

534
00:28:41,260 --> 00:28:42,750
My martial arts skills are also not as good as Chong's.

535
00:28:43,620 --> 00:28:44,900
Besides, no one can help me.

536
00:28:45,980 --> 00:28:46,580
Wei,

537
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:49,220
I'm willing to help you become the chief.

538
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:51,250
I believe you and I

539
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,390
will definitely bring the Murong Family

540
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,410
to a greater height.

541
00:28:53,410 --> 00:28:54,950
But they still have the help of the Su Family.

542
00:28:55,940 --> 00:28:56,540
Uncle,

543
00:28:58,300 --> 00:28:59,300
thank you for your kindness.

544
00:28:59,980 --> 00:29:00,980
Just forget it.

545
00:29:01,980 --> 00:29:02,420
You...

546
00:29:03,580 --> 00:29:05,470
What a coward you are!

547
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,790
Whatever you think, it's fine.

548
00:29:14,780 --> 00:29:16,500
What do you know, old guy?

549
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,020
Once I master the Divine Skill,

550
00:29:19,220 --> 00:29:21,140
who can stop me then?

551
00:29:21,660 --> 00:29:22,270
Now I'm merely

552
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:23,950
keeping a low profile to wait for a chance.

553
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,340
The position of chief

554
00:29:25,740 --> 00:29:27,140
will be mine sooner or later.

555
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:29,500
Zhuwan!

556
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:32,180
Where is your lady?

557
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:36,020
Lady Zhuwan has left.

558
00:29:36,930 --> 00:29:37,740
She has left?

559
00:29:40,220 --> 00:29:40,690
Did she leave

560
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:41,450
a letter

561
00:29:41,450 --> 00:29:42,300
or anything else?

562
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,020
Master Chong,

563
00:29:56,540 --> 00:29:59,230
Lady Zhuwan didn't leave anything here.

564
00:30:03,220 --> 00:30:04,820
I said I can protect you.

565
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,580
Why don't you trust me?
