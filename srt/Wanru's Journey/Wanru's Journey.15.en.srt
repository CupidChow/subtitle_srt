00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,590
escort my mother back to the Su family

196
00:14:25,300 --> 00:14:26,380
and keep Zhuwan safe.

197
00:14:27,250 --> 00:14:29,460
I'm sure you'll come back safe and sound.

198
00:14:46,740 --> 00:14:48,150
You told me

199
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:50,260
that I have your loyalty

200
00:14:50,740 --> 00:14:51,870
and you're forever at my service.

201
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:54,630
If I didn't come back today,

202
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:57,150
that would be my last order to you.

203
00:14:59,460 --> 00:15:00,070
Yes.

204
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,350
Zhuwan.

205
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:08,860
Zhuwan, wake up.

206
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,940
One more minute.

207
00:16:24,980 --> 00:16:26,410
Some audacious thief stole from me?

208
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:26,820
Darn it!

209
00:16:27,020 --> 00:16:28,290
When I made my way in the world,

210
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:30,030
you were still in diapers!

211
00:16:31,220 --> 00:16:31,750
What's wrong?

212
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,980
I lost my wallet.

213
00:16:39,780 --> 00:16:40,790
It's not a big deal.

214
00:16:40,930 --> 00:16:42,070
At least both of us are safe.

215
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,620
How are we going to buy food without money?

216
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,500
Everyone,

217
00:17:24,220 --> 00:17:25,819
Chief Murong's demise

218
00:17:26,099 --> 00:17:27,470
brought immense sorrow to all of us.

219
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,750
According to the Chief's will,

220
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,700
Murong Chong, his second son,

221
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:33,020
will be the next Chief.

222
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,210
To keep things fair,

223
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,220
we have this convention about the succession

224
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:39,060
that before the new Chief takes the position,

225
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,650
anyone from any sect

226
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:42,700
trained under any master

227
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,380
can fight the new Chief.

228
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,900
If they're lucky enough to win,

229
00:17:48,260 --> 00:17:50,750
they can be the new Chief.

230
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:52,450
Really?

231
00:17:52,450 --> 00:17:53,020
That's good.

232
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,180
I didn't know this.

233
00:17:56,860 --> 00:17:57,340
Okay.

234
00:18:00,660 --> 00:18:02,060
I'll preside over

235
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:04,230
the Succession Ceremony.

236
00:18:04,570 --> 00:18:05,670
According to tradition,

237
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,860
those who want to challenge the new Chief

238
00:18:08,260 --> 00:18:10,460
must get in the arena first

239
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:12,030
to fight the Ten Guardians.

240
00:18:12,820 --> 00:18:13,770
If he's still on his feet in the arena

241
00:18:13,770 --> 00:18:15,660
when one stick of incense burns out,

242
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:18,780
he can fight the Chief.

243
00:18:19,420 --> 00:18:20,060
Light the incense.

244
00:18:26,620 --> 00:18:27,460
Let's begin.

245
00:18:40,660 --> 00:18:41,980
I'll make an exception today.

246
00:18:43,460 --> 00:18:45,140
You can challenge me directly.

247
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:47,650
No need to fight the Ten Guardians

248
00:18:47,650 --> 00:18:48,420
in the arena.

249
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:06,660
Which sect are they from?

250
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,020
Stay quiet.

251
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,190
Even if they have the guts to fight Chong,

252
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,740
they don't have the ability to win.

253
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:14,460
Stop.

254
00:19:15,380 --> 00:19:16,220
Raise your head.

255
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,300
Go.

256
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,270
Stop.

257
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:20,510
Go.

258
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:26,020
Stop.

259
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:28,220
Go.

260
00:19:46,060 --> 00:19:46,740
Yueying.

261
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:49,180
Chong is so brilliant.

262
00:19:49,740 --> 00:19:50,990
If you can marry him,

263
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,660
I'll be relieved.

264
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:55,660
Father.

265
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,020
What are you talking about?

266
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,990
Chong is so good at martial arts.

267
00:20:17,300 --> 00:20:18,660
It's a pity that Zhuwan has stopped writing.

268
00:20:31,090 --> 00:20:32,340
Chong is awesome!

269
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,700
Your dishes.

270
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:36,260
Zhuwan.

271
00:20:36,460 --> 00:20:37,630
You ordered so many dishes,

272
00:20:38,010 --> 00:20:39,350
but we have no money to pay for them.

273
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:40,420
Don't worry.

274
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,000
We'll run after finishing eating.

275
00:20:42,000 --> 00:20:43,310
They can't catch up with us anyway.

276
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,660
I don't think it's a good idea.

277
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:46,740
Mr. Fu,

278
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:48,790
is your pride more important

279
00:20:49,020 --> 00:20:50,340
than our growling stomachs?

280
00:20:51,740 --> 00:20:52,180
Eat.

281
00:21:01,860 --> 00:21:03,750
I'm Lu Yong. I'll challenge you.

282
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,750
Which sect does that martial art belong to?

283
00:21:17,660 --> 00:21:19,100
Eagle Claw, I believe.

284
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,460
Eagle Claw?

285
00:21:21,900 --> 00:21:23,540
A disciple from Eagle Claw.

286
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,350
Why isn't Chong fighting back?

287
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:44,070
Is Murong Chong unable to defeat him?

288
00:21:45,020 --> 00:21:46,460
He's said to be a martial arts genius,

289
00:21:46,700 --> 00:21:47,780
but it turns out that he's not.

290
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:07,980
What martial art is that?

291
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:09,980
What's he doing?

292
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:02,780
Amazing!

293
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:03,900
He's good!

294
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:05,540
Father.

295
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:07,070
Father.

296
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,350
That guy named Lu Yong will win,

297
00:23:08,460 --> 00:23:09,300
won't he?

298
00:23:09,540 --> 00:23:10,330
Murong Chong

299
00:23:10,330 --> 00:23:11,550
has been knocked down.

300
00:24:13,700 --> 00:24:14,700
Chong is excellent.

301
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:15,300
Yes.

302
00:24:42,020 --> 00:24:42,310
What…

303
00:24:42,860 --> 00:24:43,210
He…

304
00:24:43,210 --> 00:24:44,100
Why is he here?

305
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:45,330
Why?

306
00:24:45,330 --> 00:24:45,890
It's him?

307
00:24:45,890 --> 00:24:46,620
It's him!

308
00:24:48,980 --> 00:24:49,710
Why is he here?

309
00:24:51,260 --> 00:24:51,750
Scum.

310
00:24:52,060 --> 00:24:52,460
Who is he?

311
00:24:52,460 --> 00:24:53,050
Isn't that Lu Yuyong?

312
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:53,710
Yes.

313
00:24:53,900 --> 00:24:54,420
Scum!

314
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,110
It's him.

315
00:24:55,820 --> 00:24:56,560
Isn't he

316
00:24:56,560 --> 00:24:58,710
the notorious Lu Yuyong?

317
00:25:00,180 --> 00:25:01,430
So Lu Yong

318
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:03,580
is a fake name.

319
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:04,900
Guards!

320
00:25:05,580 --> 00:25:06,910
Take him down!

321
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,050
How could a scumbag like him

322
00:25:10,050 --> 00:25:12,010
get into the Murong Mansion

323
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,230
to attend the Succession Ceremony?

324
00:25:14,300 --> 00:25:15,580
It must be a conspiracy.

325
00:25:16,260 --> 00:25:16,990
Take him away.

326
00:25:17,340 --> 00:25:18,100
I'll interrogate him later.

327
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:18,820
Please spare my life, Master Chong.

328
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:19,950
Please spare my life, Master Chong.

329
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:21,190
Please spare my life, Master Chong.

330
00:25:22,140 --> 00:25:23,180
Please spare my life, Master Chong.

331
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,460
He can't get away with it!

332
00:25:24,930 --> 00:25:25,900
Please spare my life, Master Chong.

333
00:25:28,260 --> 00:25:29,190
Please spare my life, Master Chong.

334
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:29,860
Master Chong.

335
00:25:30,020 --> 00:25:30,820
Please spare my life, Master Chong.

336
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:31,540
Pest!

337
00:25:42,100 --> 00:25:42,700
Have you finished?

338
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:43,820
Are you full?

339
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,620
Get ready.

340
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,020
I'll count to three.

341
00:25:49,300 --> 00:25:50,030
Then we run.

342
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:51,100
Okay.

343
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,350
Three.

344
00:25:54,660 --> 00:25:55,300
Two.

345
00:25:57,090 --> 00:25:57,500
One.

346
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:58,540
Waiter.

347
00:25:59,260 --> 00:25:59,780
I'd like to pay the bill.

348
00:26:00,060 --> 00:26:00,620
Coming.

349
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,320
Here.

350
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:02,660
Okay.

351
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:04,270
Sir.

352
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,890
Do you really think I'd order so much food

353
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,180
when I had no money at all?

354
00:26:07,700 --> 00:26:09,990
I keep most of my money here.

355
00:26:12,940 --> 00:26:13,260
Here you are.

356
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,790
Thank you, Miss.

357
00:26:17,620 --> 00:26:18,410
For someone

358
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:19,860
who has never dined and dashed before,

359
00:26:20,210 --> 00:26:21,220
my reaction just now

360
00:26:21,420 --> 00:26:22,590
is perfectly normal.

361
00:26:23,700 --> 00:26:24,710
The new Chief of the Martial Arts World

362
00:26:24,710 --> 00:26:25,710
will have a martial arts tournament today.

363
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:26,990
It's a pity that it's far away from here.

364
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:28,670
It must be very exciting.

365
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:29,420
I heard

366
00:26:29,660 --> 00:26:30,690
that Mr. Murong Chong

367
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:31,660
will participate too.

368
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:33,340
He's not so good at martial arts.

369
00:26:33,980 --> 00:26:35,060
Will he be beaten to death?

370
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,220
The challengers today

371
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,420
are all martial arts masters.

372
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:41,220
God bless him.

373
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:48,860
[Ruyi Lodge]

374
00:26:54,740 --> 00:26:55,260
Young Master.

375
00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:03,460
Young Master.

376
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:05,100
I'll send for Mr. Yunhe.

377
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,100
No need.

378
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,270
I just consumed too much inner force.

379
00:27:09,810 --> 00:27:11,060
I'll be fine in a few days.

380
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,860
Keep quiet.

381
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:14,380
I don't want anyone to get suspicious.

382
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:20,390
If I had got more challengers today,

383
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:21,890
I'm afraid

384
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,020
I wouldn't have won so easily.

385
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,540
If they had noticed

386
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:28,020
that my inner force had weakened,

387
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:29,630
those under the stage

388
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,040
would've taken this opportunity

389
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:32,180
to come on stage.

390
00:27:34,140 --> 00:27:34,780
Therefore,

391
00:27:35,300 --> 00:27:36,130
I had to go all out

392
00:27:36,130 --> 00:27:37,540
during the first fight

393
00:27:38,380 --> 00:27:39,380
to intimidate them.

394
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,020
Young Master.

395
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:40,990
Take a rest.

396
00:27:45,820 --> 00:27:46,470
Chong.

397
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:48,110
Madam.

398
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:49,900
Mother.

399
00:27:50,420 --> 00:27:50,900
Chong.

400
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,540
Mother.

401
00:27:52,660 --> 00:27:53,220
Chong.

402
00:27:53,730 --> 00:27:54,470
What's wrong with you?

403
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:55,740
Mother.

404
00:27:57,180 --> 00:27:57,990
Mother, I'm fine.

405
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,910
I just consumed too much inner force.

406
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:00,950
I'll be fine tomorrow.

407
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:02,500
Tomorrow…

408
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:03,740
You can't fight again.

409
00:28:04,420 --> 00:28:05,590
I'll tell your uncle

410
00:28:05,780 --> 00:28:06,730
to take some men

411
00:28:06,730 --> 00:28:07,780
to kick those challengers out.

412
00:28:08,340 --> 00:28:10,420
We'll kill those who disobey

413
00:28:10,620 --> 00:28:12,340
until the rest are scared away.

414
00:28:12,500 --> 00:28:12,950
Mother,

415
00:28:13,820 --> 00:28:15,100
if I want to be the Chief,

416
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,330
I have to

417
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:17,750
fight on my own to achieve it.

418
00:28:20,740 --> 00:28:21,420
Don't worry.

419
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:23,100
I know what I'm doing.

420
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:27,690
I didn't expect Murong Chong

421
00:28:27,690 --> 00:28:29,860
to beat Lu Yuyong.

422
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,100
It seems

423
00:28:31,940 --> 00:28:33,910
that I underestimated him.

424
00:28:34,290 --> 00:28:35,060
Then,

425
00:28:35,370 --> 00:28:37,140
how are we going to deal with him tomorrow?

426
00:28:38,820 --> 00:28:40,580
Does anyone have any ideas?

427
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:42,620
Well…

428
00:28:48,300 --> 00:28:49,220
Mr. Wei,

429
00:28:50,460 --> 00:28:51,940
do you have any suggestions?

430
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,510
Yes, Mr. Wei.

431
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,100
Tell us what you think.

432
00:28:55,380 --> 00:28:56,380
Tell us.

433
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,590
Well…

434
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:05,540
Murong Chong

435
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:07,380
is quite good at martial arts.

436
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:09,030
How about…

437
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:11,500
How about this?

438
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:12,630
Let's

439
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,950
give up fighting and go home

440
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:17,230
to enjoy the company of our wives and children.

441
00:29:17,540 --> 00:29:18,100
What do you think?

442
00:29:19,540 --> 00:29:20,810
What nonsense is that?

443
00:29:20,810 --> 00:29:21,820
What are you talking about?

444
00:29:21,980 --> 00:29:22,750
Mr. Wei,

445
00:29:23,260 --> 00:29:24,390
think before you speak.

446
00:29:26,220 --> 00:29:26,820
Today,

447
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:29,340
Murong Chong won by a sheer fluke.

448
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:31,550
Don't worry.

449
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,470
Tomorrow,

450
00:29:35,740 --> 00:29:38,100
I'll make sure that he gets whipped.

451
00:30:45,940 --> 00:30:46,620
Welcome.

452
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:51,140
Are you here for food or room?

453
00:30:51,570 --> 00:30:52,060
Who'd come for food

454
00:30:52,060 --> 00:30:53,220
at this late hour?

455
00:30:53,380 --> 00:30:54,620
We need somewhere to stay.

456
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,540
Sure.

457
00:30:57,420 --> 00:31:00,140
I want two first-class rooms.

458
00:31:00,300 --> 00:31:00,700
First-class…

459
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:05,820
Look.

460
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:07,260
I have a lot of money.

461
00:31:10,260 --> 00:31:11,190
Please wait a moment.

462
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:15,460
[Bank of Shengyue]

463
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:18,910
[Bank of Shengyue]

464
00:31:27,540 --> 00:31:28,900
Please go upstairs.

465
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:29,700
Please.

466
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:31,310
Give me your arm.

467
00:31:32,770 --> 00:31:34,220
This way, please.

468
00:31:34,220 --> 00:31:35,660
You're quite heavy.

469
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,030
Something seems wrong.

470
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,580
Well…

471
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,260
Sir.

472
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:50,030
I…

473
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:52,180
I suddenly remembered something.

474
00:31:53,740 --> 00:31:54,300
I…

475
00:31:56,180 --> 00:31:56,720
What's wrong?

476
00:31:56,720 --> 00:31:58,540
My dog is pregnant.

477
00:31:58,940 --> 00:32:00,010
I'm worried about her

478
00:32:00,010 --> 00:32:00,850
and the puppy.

479
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:01,340
Well,

480
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:03,580
I gotta go.

481
00:32:04,900 --> 00:32:05,220
Wait.

482
00:32:07,010 --> 00:32:07,860
Boss, they…

483
00:32:08,180 --> 00:32:08,860
They…

484
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,020
Her dog is pregnant?

485
00:32:14,260 --> 00:32:14,630
No!

486
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,620
Go after them!

487
00:32:15,820 --> 00:32:17,460
Don't stand there. Go after them!

488
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,210
Why can't we get rid of

489
00:32:44,210 --> 00:32:45,660
those men in black?

490
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:46,520
It seems

491
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:47,190
that the bank notes you used just now

492
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,540
gave us away.

493
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,250
If that's the case,

494
00:32:50,250 --> 00:32:51,740
does it mean we can't spend money anymore?

495
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,980
Why are you

496
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:54,500
still thinking about money at this time?

497
00:32:54,980 --> 00:32:55,900
What do you know?

498
00:32:56,380 --> 00:32:57,130
I can be dead,

499
00:32:57,130 --> 00:32:58,420
but I can't be broke.

500
00:32:58,730 --> 00:32:59,590
I'll give you money in the future.

501
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:02,820
We can't hide here.

502
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:04,620
They'll be back soon.

503
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:05,270
Let's go.

504
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,580
Okay.
