00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:42,009
Why are there

6
00:01:42,009 --> 00:01:43,840
a few new faces today?

7
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:45,300
They're the disciples of the Peak Manager

8
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,300
and were on a trip with their masters.

9
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,570
Their life

10
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,390
sounds very comfortable to me.

11
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,220
Your masters

12
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:58,890
have told you

13
00:01:58,890 --> 00:02:00,420
about the rules.

14
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:02,860
I won't say more about that.

15
00:02:03,700 --> 00:02:04,670
In Yunji Peak,

16
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:06,540
there are disciples waiting to challenge you.

17
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,419
They won't go easy on you.

18
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:11,100
Good luck.

19
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:11,980
Off you go.

20
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:12,820
Yes.

21
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,100
Zhuwan,

22
00:02:19,820 --> 00:02:20,980
you and Bao are not good at martial arts.

23
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:22,350
Why don't you team up with us?

24
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:24,740
But according to the rules,

25
00:02:24,860 --> 00:02:26,770
we're supposed to act alone, aren't we?

26
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:27,790
According to the rules,

27
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:28,800
each of us

28
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,170
should do our best

29
00:02:30,170 --> 00:02:31,460
to practice the skills we learned.

30
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,300
No one says

31
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,380
that we can't look out for each other.

32
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:36,060
Don't worry about us.

33
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:37,980
I don't want to be your burden.

34
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:38,860
Hong.

35
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:41,230
It seems that Zhuwan is very confident

36
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,530
and doesn't need our help.

37
00:02:42,530 --> 00:02:43,020
Yes.

38
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:44,770
My brother knows me well.

39
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:46,310
I'd feel terrible

40
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:48,030
if I dragged you down.

41
00:02:48,620 --> 00:02:49,100
Zhuwan.

42
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,380
How are we…

43
00:02:53,579 --> 00:02:54,310
Take this.

44
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:59,350
Is this a Thunder Ball?

45
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,010
If you meet enemies

46
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,540
played by other disciples,

47
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:04,590
use it to drive them away.

48
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:05,980
If you meet wild animals,

49
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:07,060
ignite it.

50
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:07,930
Chong and I

51
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:08,790
will come to help you soon.

52
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:09,430
Okay.

53
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:10,820
Alright, Hong.

54
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:12,350
Time is pressing.

55
00:03:12,660 --> 00:03:13,340
Let's go.

56
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,460
Zhuwan.

57
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,620
You're so respectful to our master.

58
00:03:19,820 --> 00:03:21,340
You're willing to leave late to see her off.

59
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,730
It'll be easier for us

60
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:25,860
to find equipment after they left.

61
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,380
What equipment?

62
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:30,600
Let's go.

63
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:31,490
Where are we going?

64
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:32,420
Let's go.

65
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,580
We've been waiting for so long.

66
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:34,060
Has she fallen into the river?

67
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:35,860
I don't think so.

68
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,450
New disciples with poor lightness skill

69
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,659
can take bamboo rafts into the woods.

70
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,020
The rafts stop somewhere downstream.

71
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,780
They have to enter the woods from here.

72
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:44,020
What if she didn't take this path?

73
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:45,980
The Yunji Peak is so big.

74
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,940
It won't be easy for us to find her.

75
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,270
It's hard for us to find her,

76
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,340
but for those from Xianruo Pavilion,

77
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,740
it's a piece of cake.

78
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:58,940
How are the preparations going?

79
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:00,190
I've contacted

80
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,140
the best assassin organization

81
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,420
Xianruo Pavilion.

82
00:05:04,100 --> 00:05:05,940
During the drill,

83
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:08,350
they'll pretend to be the disciples acting as enemies.

84
00:05:08,660 --> 00:05:10,300
I'll make sure

85
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,910
that this drill

86
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,380
will be the death of her.

87
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,590
What a foolproof plan.

88
00:05:16,730 --> 00:05:17,980
You're so smart, Qing.

89
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,030
Let's take a break here.

90
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:29,660
Bao.

91
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,780
Take it out.

92
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:32,790
Okay.

93
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:40,820
Your dagger is so beautiful.

94
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,740
I didn't mean that.

95
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,520
We may encounter enemies anytime

96
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,140
and need more than

97
00:05:46,140 --> 00:05:47,300
a dagger to fight them.

98
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:54,740
Run!

99
00:05:58,860 --> 00:05:59,340
Run!

100
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:05,460
Bao, are you okay?

101
00:06:05,620 --> 00:06:06,500
Get up.

102
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,340
I was so scared.

103
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,670
So they were just passing by.

104
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:30,170
I thought

105
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:31,420
they were coming for us.

106
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,340
Get up.

107
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,310
Wait.

108
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:34,900
I…

109
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,340
We can't stay here for long.

110
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:45,540
Fortunately, we got informed in time.

111
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:47,350
That girl is going to be the manager's wife.

112
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,659
We'd lose our lives if we hurt her.

113
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:49,700
Exactly.

114
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,860
We put on quite a show

115
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:52,140
and they bought it.

116
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:53,230
-Let's go. -OK.

117
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,310
Bao.

118
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,540
Take it out.

119
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:14,580
Okay.

120
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:26,460
Why are they back?

121
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,180
I know.

122
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,770
They're disciples sent here

123
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:35,070
to test us during the drill.

124
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,500
They'll leave if we refuse to fight.

125
00:07:43,610 --> 00:07:44,180
I…

126
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:46,900
Are they serious?

127
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,780
They're not

128
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:06,990
with those guys just now.

129
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:09,340
Are they here to kill me?

130
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:20,180
I'm warning you. Don't come over.

131
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,310
I'm fierce.

132
00:08:36,539 --> 00:08:37,710
That's Zhuwan's Thunder Ball.

133
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,549
Have they run into a beast?

134
00:08:41,140 --> 00:08:41,580
Let's go.

135
00:08:44,980 --> 00:08:45,820
Murong Chong!

136
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:46,910
Zhuwan, are you okay?

137
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:48,460
I'm fine.

138
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:50,070
Bao was knocked out by the explosion.

139
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:50,730
Chong.

140
00:08:50,730 --> 00:08:51,330
Bao.

141
00:08:51,330 --> 00:08:52,020
-Let's end this fight quickly. -Bao.

142
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,030
We don't know who they are.

143
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:54,220
-Take Zhuwan away. -Bao.

144
00:08:54,580 --> 00:08:55,460
What about you, Hong?

145
00:08:55,580 --> 00:08:56,590
Their target is Zhuwan.

146
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:58,380
-It'll be more dangerous if she stays. -Bao!

147
00:08:58,650 --> 00:08:59,460
Bao.

148
00:08:59,580 --> 00:09:00,220
Be careful.

149
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:01,300
Leave Bao to me.

150
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,270
Go.

151
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:02,980
Go.

152
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,950
Mr. Fu, be careful.

153
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,380
So much for Murong Wei's

154
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,940
Hidden Blade.

155
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:32,020
Young Master.

156
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:34,460
I'm late. Are you okay?

157
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,180
Go ahead.

158
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:40,710
He won't wake up soon.

159
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,700
We searched the whole Mount Shengyue

160
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,910
but didn't find the secret place.

161
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:45,260
The information is from the Pavilion.

162
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,630
It should be reliable.

163
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,850
Let's search for it

164
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,910
together later.

165
00:09:51,140 --> 00:09:51,820
How about him?

166
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,830
Sprinkle around him

167
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:57,130
the powder

168
00:09:57,130 --> 00:09:58,150
that can keep bugs and animals away.

169
00:09:58,340 --> 00:09:59,340
We'll wake him up after we come back.

170
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:00,620
Yes, Young Master.

171
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:12,270
Why is it so hard

172
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,110
to get rid of those guys?

173
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,990
Can't we finish them off?

174
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:15,900
We can't stop.

175
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:17,240
If they have accomplices

176
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:17,860
hiding nearby,

177
00:10:18,090 --> 00:10:18,950
we won't be able to escape.

178
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:21,980
I wonder how Bao is.

179
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:22,860
I hope

180
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,180
he's fine.

181
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:25,490
Why didn't you leave him

182
00:10:25,490 --> 00:10:26,220
and run away?

183
00:10:26,740 --> 00:10:28,800
I was afraid he would haunt me

184
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,100
and knock on my window at night if he died.

185
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,420
You just couldn't bring yourself to do that, right?

186
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:33,270
Watch out!

187
00:10:49,780 --> 00:10:51,350
It hurts!

188
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:58,670
Murong Chong!

189
00:11:00,100 --> 00:11:00,820
Murong Chong!

190
00:11:01,940 --> 00:11:03,780
Murong Chong. Murong Chong.

191
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:07,580
Don't die!

192
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:08,990
Murong Chong!

193
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,540
You can't die.

194
00:11:10,780 --> 00:11:11,580
Murong Chong!

195
00:11:12,340 --> 00:11:14,270
Murong Chong! Murong Chong!

196
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:15,310
Murong Chong!

197
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:17,290
Wake up!

198
00:11:17,290 --> 00:11:18,780
I'll die if you keep shaking.

199
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:21,860
You scared me.

200
00:11:23,010 --> 00:11:24,150
Let me help you up.

201
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:26,830
Come on.

202
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,900
I'll press the wound.

203
00:11:43,340 --> 00:11:44,180
You help me pull the arrow out

204
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:44,730
from behind.

205
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,350
No.

206
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:47,450
You'll die if I draw the arrow out.

207
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:49,060
Don't worry. I know what I'm doing.

208
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,700
Now.

209
00:12:04,780 --> 00:12:05,580
Are you okay?

210
00:12:07,980 --> 00:12:08,780
No!

211
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:10,790
You think I'd be okay after getting shot?

212
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,550
It seemed that that man in black

213
00:12:18,930 --> 00:12:21,380
wanted me to fall into this cave.

214
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,660
Who is he?

215
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,740
What's he up to?

216
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,710
There's another cave over there.

217
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:32,940
Let's go

218
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:34,310
check it out.

219
00:12:34,780 --> 00:12:35,300
Come.

220
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:39,260
It hurts.

221
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,460
Wait.

222
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:22,910
I didn't know

223
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,830
there was such a place in Mount Shengyue.

224
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:36,510
I'll go take a look.

225
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:38,900
Be careful.

226
00:13:53,060 --> 00:13:53,900
Look at this.

227
00:13:58,980 --> 00:14:00,820
Your wound needs to be treated.

228
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,670
I'll get some herbs for you.

229
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,150
Be careful.

230
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:06,150
Okay.

231
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:37,300
This manual…

232
00:14:38,020 --> 00:14:38,860
Is this

233
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,580
Shanhai Secret Manual?

234
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,750
God bless me.

235
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:46,460
I'm too young to die.

236
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:47,500
[Shanhai Secret Manual]

237
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:40,340
We've searched everywhere.

238
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,430
Where on earth is that secret place?

239
00:15:43,740 --> 00:15:44,110
Young Master.

240
00:15:44,500 --> 00:15:45,460
I'll sweep the woods again.

241
00:15:45,900 --> 00:15:46,340
No need.

242
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,460
The information may be false.

243
00:15:51,610 --> 00:15:52,070
Meng Tang.

244
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,420
Punch me.

245
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:54,500
Punch you?

246
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:55,270
Just do it.

247
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:01,110
Young Master, are you alright?

248
00:16:07,460 --> 00:16:08,540
Stay hidden

249
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,980
until the drill ends.

250
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:10,860
Go.

251
00:16:11,500 --> 00:16:11,940
Okay.

252
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:12,980
Take care.

253
00:16:22,700 --> 00:16:24,230
Mr. Fu, where are we?

254
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,180
Where is Zhuwan?

255
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,020
We met assassins just now.

256
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,870
I asked Zhuwan and Chong to leave first.

257
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:31,420
Let's go find them.

258
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,660
Mr. Fu, you're injured?

259
00:16:35,860 --> 00:16:36,780
I'm fine.

260
00:16:36,900 --> 00:16:38,180
Let's find them first.

261
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,390
Let me help you.

262
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,460
Let's go.

263
00:16:43,340 --> 00:16:44,340
You're lucky.

264
00:16:44,820 --> 00:16:45,890
The herbs in this cave

265
00:16:45,890 --> 00:16:47,060
can stop the bleeding.

266
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,670
You know herbs?

267
00:16:50,010 --> 00:16:51,660
I read medical books.

268
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:55,110
You read medical books?

269
00:16:55,460 --> 00:16:56,590
Why are you so surprised?

270
00:16:57,810 --> 00:16:59,380
I know a lot more than you think.

271
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,870
I doubt that.

272
00:17:03,820 --> 00:17:05,390
These herbs are safe.

273
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:07,109
I bet your life on it.

274
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:12,940
What are you doing?

275
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,849
Don't worry.

276
00:17:13,849 --> 00:17:15,069
I'm not interested in you.

277
00:17:15,250 --> 00:17:16,010
You're not as well-built as

278
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:16,900
Mr. Fu.

279
00:17:17,380 --> 00:17:18,540
What did you do to Hong?

280
00:17:19,140 --> 00:17:20,990
We're engaged.

281
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,609
It's normal that I did something to him.

282
00:17:22,670 --> 00:17:23,230
You…

283
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,829
Don't move.

284
00:17:27,060 --> 00:17:28,010
Your wound has just healed a bit.

285
00:17:28,010 --> 00:17:28,990
You may tear it open again.

286
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,890
I was joking.

287
00:17:33,890 --> 00:17:35,070
We didn't do anything.

288
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,260
I can undress myself.

289
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:05,770
♫Autumn was like a dream♫

290
00:18:02,900 --> 00:18:03,430
Do it now.

291
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:12,780
♫We drank under the star-blanketed sky♫

292
00:18:09,820 --> 00:18:10,590
Hold it there.

293
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:15,890
♫The past is all a blur now♫

294
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:23,570
♫Flowers bloom and wither, then bloom again♫

295
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:29,800
♫Snow melts in the afterglow♫

296
00:18:30,630 --> 00:18:35,020
♫I let my sorrow grow♫

297
00:18:35,990 --> 00:18:42,940
♫It's raining again, I miss you so much♫

298
00:18:43,130 --> 00:18:48,020
♫Where are you now?♫

299
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:54,260
♫It's love at first sight♫

300
00:18:54,260 --> 00:19:00,740
♫I keep wondering when we'll meet again♫

301
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:04,320
♫You painted my sky colorful♫

302
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,950
♫I don't know how to put my feelings into words♫

303
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:13,730
♫Just bring more wine and live in the moment♫

304
00:19:28,820 --> 00:19:29,990
Here, have a bite.

305
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:30,900
Take it.

306
00:19:31,580 --> 00:19:32,340
I've washed it.

307
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,180
I've washed it.

308
00:19:34,100 --> 00:19:34,610
How come there's no news

309
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:36,060
coming back yet?

310
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:37,820
Qing.

311
00:19:38,370 --> 00:19:39,510
There are too many people here.

312
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,420
Be careful with what you say.

313
00:19:48,010 --> 00:19:48,810
Xianruo Pavilion

314
00:19:48,810 --> 00:19:50,460
is known for its ruthlessness.

315
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,490
They should have

316
00:19:51,490 --> 00:19:52,580
gotten it done by now.

317
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:54,060
Is their reputation all hype?

318
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,670
Calm down.

319
00:19:57,460 --> 00:19:58,990
This forest is big.

320
00:19:59,100 --> 00:19:59,870
Besides,

321
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,750
Zhuwan may still have Thunder Balls.

322
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,780
That's why it's taking them so long.

323
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,430
I hope so.

324
00:20:10,780 --> 00:20:11,780
Mr. Fu.

325
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:13,180
It's good to see you here.

326
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:14,420
What a lovely surprise!

327
00:20:14,660 --> 00:20:15,370
Have you seen Chong

328
00:20:15,370 --> 00:20:16,300
and Zhuwan?

329
00:20:16,620 --> 00:20:17,780
How would I know where that fool…

330
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:19,630
where she is?

331
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:20,740
Mr. Fu.

332
00:20:21,740 --> 00:20:23,260
How are Zhuwan and Master Chong?

333
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:24,740
We met assassins just now.

334
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:26,420
When we fought back,

335
00:20:26,780 --> 00:20:27,370
Chong and Zhuwan

336
00:20:27,370 --> 00:20:28,430
got separated from us.

337
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,660
We don't know where they are now.

338
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:31,860
Do you have any clues?

339
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,030
I'll go search for them with you.

340
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:34,620
If you want to help us,

341
00:20:35,060 --> 00:20:36,190
let's split up.

342
00:20:36,370 --> 00:20:37,420
We stand a bigger chance of finding them that way.

343
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:38,970
Let's start searching now.

344
00:20:38,970 --> 00:20:39,380
Let's go.

345
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:40,540
Okay.

346
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,100
Mr. Fu.

347
00:20:44,420 --> 00:20:44,980
Qing.

348
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:47,550
Would the assassins

349
00:20:48,140 --> 00:20:49,090
from Xianruo Pavilion

350
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:49,700
hurt Chong?

351
00:20:50,780 --> 00:20:52,150
How would I know?

352
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,220
Watch your manners!

353
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,130
It's unseemly to look so fluttered

354
00:21:03,130 --> 00:21:04,060
in front of Her Ladyship.

355
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,140
Madam, bad news.

356
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,670
Catch your breath

357
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,260
and tell me what happened.

358
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:09,190
Madam.

359
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,780
A letter from Mount Shengyue arrived.

360
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,140
It said that Master Chong and Miss Zhuwan

361
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,340
encountered assassins

362
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,550
and are missing now.

363
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,990
What did you say?

364
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:22,870
Madam.

365
00:21:23,450 --> 00:21:25,590
Master Chong and Miss Zhuwan

366
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:26,870
are missing now.

367
00:21:27,780 --> 00:21:28,790
No one knows if they're still alive.

368
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,580
Madam.

369
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:33,420
Madam!

370
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,430
Madam!

371
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,460
The Murong family

372
00:21:38,570 --> 00:21:40,510
is indeed from a prominent family.

373
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:43,380
There are so many rare flowers and plants

374
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,340
in your garden.

375
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,670
They look so beautiful.

376
00:21:49,220 --> 00:21:50,830
I bet it's the same in the Fu family's garden.

377
00:21:51,700 --> 00:21:52,540
Please, Lord Fu.

378
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,820
Please.

379
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,020
Master Wei, letter from Mount Shengyue.

380
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,260
Leave us.

381
00:22:03,700 --> 00:22:04,100
Yes.

382
00:22:09,750 --> 00:22:11,810
[A group of men in black tried to kill Master Chong, Mr. Fu Hong, and Miss Zhuwan during the drill.]

383
00:22:16,860 --> 00:22:18,550
Mr. Fu Hong, Chong, and Zhuwan

384
00:22:19,540 --> 00:22:20,380
encountered assassins!

385
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,100
What?

386
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:22,790
Lord Fu.

387
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,020
Lord Fu.

388
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,620
Master Wei.

389
00:22:30,940 --> 00:22:31,390
If…

390
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,110
If anything happened to Hong,

391
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,060
you…

392
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:36,290
You must give me

393
00:22:36,290 --> 00:22:37,580
an explanation.

394
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,550
Don't worry, Lord Fu.

395
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:41,740
Mr. Fu Hong only got minor injuries.

396
00:22:41,900 --> 00:22:42,950
He's fine.

397
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:43,940
Thank god.

398
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:45,820
But Chong and Zhuwan

399
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:47,580
are missing.

400
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:50,580
Well,

401
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,390
is there any more news

402
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,140
on how they are now?

403
00:22:56,260 --> 00:22:58,270
No.

404
00:23:08,820 --> 00:23:09,230
God.

405
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:18,290
This cave seems to have been built

406
00:23:18,290 --> 00:23:19,820
for a special purpose.

407
00:23:20,180 --> 00:23:21,020
My, my, my.

408
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,670
Imagine how much labor was needed.

409
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:26,290
Looks like

410
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:27,610
the one who built this cave

411
00:23:27,610 --> 00:23:28,650
didn't want those who got in

412
00:23:28,650 --> 00:23:29,660
to leave.

413
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:32,340
Murong Chong.

414
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,060
Murong Chong.

415
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:40,550
Murong Chong!

416
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:43,070
Murong Chong!

417
00:23:48,660 --> 00:23:49,900
You're having a fever.

418
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,820
Zhuwan.

419
00:24:28,620 --> 00:24:29,470
Chong.

420
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,500
Zhuwan.

421
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:12,500
Zhuwan.

422
00:26:27,860 --> 00:26:28,580
Zhuwan.

423
00:26:30,340 --> 00:26:31,260
You're awake.

424
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,070
How do you feel?

425
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:35,220
I'm fine.

426
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:38,340
You must be hungry.

427
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:40,540
Eat something first.

428
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,340
Where did you get it?

429
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,150
I conjured it.

430
00:26:50,010 --> 00:26:50,860
How about you?

431
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,570
When you were unconscious,

432
00:26:52,570 --> 00:26:53,940
I ate a lot.

433
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:54,980
I'm very full now.

434
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,420
Can you imagine me letting myself starve?

435
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:04,460
Here.

436
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,740
Take it.

437
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:06,910
I…

438
00:27:07,380 --> 00:27:08,380
I don't want to eat.

439
00:27:08,730 --> 00:27:09,940
I've already eaten.

440
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,240
I'll go there

441
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:12,180
to see if there's a way out.

442
00:27:15,980 --> 00:27:18,100
Sorry, my poor stomach.

443
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,140
He's a patient.

444
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,900
We have to show him sympathy.

445
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:21,740
After I get out,

446
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,380
I'll treat you to a nice meal.

447
00:27:39,540 --> 00:27:40,580
-Chong. -Chong.

448
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:41,150
Zhuwan.

449
00:27:41,730 --> 00:27:43,030
Chong.

450
00:27:43,580 --> 00:27:44,550
-Zhuwan! -Chong.

451
00:27:45,380 --> 00:27:45,860
Zhuwan.

452
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:46,830
-Chong. -Chong.

453
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:47,900
Zhuwan.

454
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:48,820
Zhuwan.

455
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,900
Chong!

456
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:50,900
Where are you?

457
00:27:51,100 --> 00:27:51,630
Zhuwan.

458
00:27:51,810 --> 00:27:52,420
Zhuwan.

459
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,550
Chong.

460
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,320
Zhuwan.

461
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:55,180
Chong.

462
00:28:02,090 --> 00:28:02,790
Zhuwan.

463
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,180
Zhuwan.

464
00:28:09,820 --> 00:28:10,420
Zhuwan.

465
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:12,900
Murong Chong!

466
00:28:13,980 --> 00:28:14,790
Murong Chong!

467
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,580
You can't go on like this.

468
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:19,420
You…

469
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:20,030
Here.

470
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,500
Sit tight.

471
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,340
Zhuwan.

472
00:28:45,940 --> 00:28:46,860
Stop!

473
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:48,320
It's dangerous here.

474
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:49,690
What if you drain your internal force?

475
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:50,340
Have you forgotten

476
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:52,860
that Lady Luck is always with me?

477
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:54,730
If I drain my internal force today,

478
00:28:54,730 --> 00:28:56,060
it'll come back tomorrow.

479
00:28:56,420 --> 00:28:57,370
Leave me alone.

480
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,340
I don't need your help.

481
00:28:58,580 --> 00:28:59,620
Shut up.

482
00:29:00,220 --> 00:29:01,100
Focus.

483
00:29:25,940 --> 00:29:26,660
How do you feel?

484
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,620
Are you feeling better?

485
00:29:33,380 --> 00:29:34,780
I'm glad it works.

486
00:29:36,860 --> 00:29:38,300
Why is she so nice to me?

487
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:40,750
Has she fallen in love with me?

488
00:29:40,940 --> 00:29:42,390
I have to get out of here.

489
00:29:42,740 --> 00:29:43,610
I haven't sold

490
00:29:43,610 --> 00:29:45,060
the treasures I collected yet.

491
00:29:49,580 --> 00:29:50,300
What are you doing?

492
00:29:54,860 --> 00:29:55,500
Well,

493
00:29:56,620 --> 00:29:57,260
you…

494
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,500
You got some mud on your forehead.

495
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:05,620
Murong Chong.

496
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,140
Don't worry.

497
00:30:07,420 --> 00:30:09,070
I'll get you out of here.

498
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:11,190
Okay.

499
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:13,180
We're big shots.

500
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:14,280
How's it possible

501
00:30:14,280 --> 00:30:15,300
that our lives will end here?

502
00:30:18,420 --> 00:30:19,320
I just want you

503
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:20,180
to rest a little longer

504
00:30:20,420 --> 00:30:21,270
before we think about what to do next.

505
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:23,730
Your wound

506
00:30:23,730 --> 00:30:25,370
has stopped worsening,

507
00:30:25,370 --> 00:30:26,130
but the longer

508
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:26,890
we stay here,

509
00:30:26,890 --> 00:30:28,260
the more danger we may be in.

510
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,690
We need to get out as soon as possible

511
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:30,550
to treat your wound.

512
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,660
Murong Chong,

513
00:30:36,140 --> 00:30:37,090
do you have the guts

514
00:30:37,090 --> 00:30:38,070
to take a chance with me?

515
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,250
Rest assured.

516
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,140
Even if we died,

517
00:30:41,380 --> 00:30:42,910
I'd keep you company on the way to the Underworld.

518
00:30:43,180 --> 00:30:43,990
You wouldn't be bored.

519
00:30:48,020 --> 00:30:49,740
I don't want to die with you.

520
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:51,660
However,

521
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:53,580
I trust you.

522
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,460
It doesn't matter if you fail.

523
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:59,060
I have one too.

524
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:04,100
Well, this one is yours. I took it from you.

525
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,180
Good for you.

526
00:31:19,900 --> 00:31:20,420
How about

527
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,670
I do it?

528
00:31:23,100 --> 00:31:24,010
Don't worry. I can do it.

529
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:24,660
Trust me.

530
00:31:25,300 --> 00:31:25,740
You...

531
00:31:26,460 --> 00:31:27,300
Give it to me. Let me do it.

532
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:28,260
Don't worry. Let's go.

533
00:31:32,980 --> 00:31:33,500
Zhuwan.

534
00:31:33,900 --> 00:31:34,430
Chong.

535
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,140
Zhuwan.

536
00:31:35,150 --> 00:31:35,940
-Chong. -Zhuwan.

537
00:31:36,050 --> 00:31:36,610
Zhuwan.

538
00:31:36,610 --> 00:31:37,090
Chong.

539
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:37,660
Chong.

540
00:31:38,020 --> 00:31:38,500
Zhuwan.

541
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:39,290
Zhuwan.

542
00:31:39,290 --> 00:31:39,740
Zhuwan.

543
00:31:40,180 --> 00:31:40,770
Chong.

544
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,450
-Zhuwan. -Chong.

545
00:31:42,450 --> 00:31:43,030
Zhuwan.

546
00:31:43,380 --> 00:31:43,940
Zhuwan.

547
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:45,750
Zhuwan.

548
00:31:45,930 --> 00:31:46,700
Chong.

549
00:31:46,820 --> 00:31:47,380
Zhuwan.

550
00:31:47,660 --> 00:31:48,310
Zhuwan.

551
00:31:57,780 --> 00:31:58,860
Are you ready?

552
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,420
I'll throw it now.

553
00:32:26,540 --> 00:32:27,100
Look.

554
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:27,940
Murong Chong.

555
00:32:28,740 --> 00:32:29,420
Look.

556
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:32,260
Your hand is injured.

557
00:32:32,460 --> 00:32:33,270
Let me dress the wound for you.

558
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,980
Don't bother. Let's go.
