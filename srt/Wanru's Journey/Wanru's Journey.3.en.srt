while you'd be just a dispensable supporting role.

193
00:08:43,690 --> 00:08:45,010
Of course you envy me.

194
00:08:46,420 --> 00:08:48,450
You think I'm inferior to you?

195
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,090
You're so audacious!

196
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:51,280
I'll rip

197
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:52,850
your annoying face off today!

198
00:08:52,850 --> 00:08:54,560
I swear!

199
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:01,410
You're not Zhuwan.

200
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:03,040
You're not Zhuwan.

201
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:04,680
Who are you?

202
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:07,090
Only a bad woman can handle a bad woman.

203
00:09:07,250 --> 00:09:08,970
Guess I'm here to punish you.

204
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:09,650
I advise you

205
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,040
to behave yourself in the future.

206
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:12,570
I'm going to kill you!

207
00:09:15,300 --> 00:09:16,770
Murong Qing wants to kill me!

208
00:09:16,770 --> 00:09:17,720
Help!

209
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,680
Miss Zhuwan!

210
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:30,530
I…

211
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:30,970
Zhuwan.

212
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:31,840
I didn't push her.

213
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,530
Miss Zhuwan!

214
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,240
Zhuwan.

215
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:38,740
Those girls in the Murong family

216
00:09:38,740 --> 00:09:40,330
are hard to deal with.

217
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,490
I was just joking,

218
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,240
but she wanted me dead.

219
00:09:48,260 --> 00:09:50,370
Fortunately, I was prepared.

220
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,490
Otherwise, I would've died here.

221
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:00,160
Good for me. I took something from them.

222
00:10:00,780 --> 00:10:01,690
It's worth

223
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,520
putting on such a show.

224
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:09,940
[Fu Hong, the son of the Governor of Jian'an City]

225
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:10,370
What is Zhuwan doing here?

226
00:10:11,980 --> 00:10:14,600
They're indeed from a prestigious family.

227
00:10:15,020 --> 00:10:17,560
These are all first-class.

228
00:10:29,460 --> 00:10:31,570
Oh my god.

229
00:10:31,780 --> 00:10:36,280
What a sight for sore eyes!

230
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,800
Wait.

231
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,130
She looks like

232
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,810
she didn't recognize me.

233
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:51,200
You're so handsome.

234
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,520
Are you married?

235
00:10:52,660 --> 00:10:54,640
I'm here for cultivation.

236
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:56,440
I apologize

237
00:10:56,620 --> 00:10:57,960
if I disturbed you.

238
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:00,130
You didn't, Sir.

239
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:01,250
Sir?

240
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:04,240
It's interesting to hear you call me that.

241
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,130
Well…

242
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:10,320
It may be rude of me to ask this,

243
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:12,000
but can you hear what they are talking about

244
00:11:12,090 --> 00:11:13,680
on the cliff?

245
00:11:17,130 --> 00:11:19,000
That idiot fell off the cliff.

246
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,480
She doesn't know martial arts.

247
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,810
She must have died.

248
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:33,240
These are my trophies.

249
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:36,440
I'll give you half.

250
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:39,720
Can you forget seeing me here

251
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,440
and stay out of this?

252
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:44,290
I don't like meddling in others' business.

253
00:11:44,620 --> 00:11:45,680
I won't say anything.

254
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,010
Don't worry.

255
00:11:47,340 --> 00:11:48,760
Then…

256
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,610
You don't want it?

257
00:11:52,750 --> 00:11:54,010
I knew it.

258
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,520
These worldly things

259
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:56,190
will stain the hands

260
00:11:56,190 --> 00:11:57,620
of an unworldly man like you.

261
00:11:57,830 --> 00:11:59,130
Let them stain mine.

262
00:11:59,550 --> 00:12:00,600
Why do I have the feeling

263
00:12:00,690 --> 00:12:01,910
that she has changed a lot?

264
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:03,750
Aren't you going up?

265
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:05,940
The thing is,

266
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,200
it's inappropriate for me

267
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:07,990
to go up by myself now.

268
00:12:07,990 --> 00:12:09,670
I have to wait for them to come down.

269
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:16,270
I've got the pay.

270
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:17,400
I have to carry the show

271
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,700
to the end.

272
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:21,140
You're a very interesting girl.

273
00:12:21,270 --> 00:12:23,160
Don't worry about me, Sir.

274
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,630
Go about your business.

275
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:26,430
I guess those guys

276
00:12:26,430 --> 00:12:27,940
will soon come down to find me.

277
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,420
I've been here for a long time.

278
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,600
I was about to go up.

279
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:06,750
Judging from your outfit,

280
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:09,650
you're not from Mount Shengyue, are you?

281
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:11,240
You'll know who I am

282
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,680
after we go up.

283
00:13:14,690 --> 00:13:16,960
You don't need to wait for them to save you.

284
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,800
I can carry you up now.

285
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,060
I really didn't push her.

286
00:13:30,350 --> 00:13:31,240
What's going on?

287
00:13:33,250 --> 00:13:33,920
Murong Qing,

288
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:35,100
Murong Qing pushed Zhuwan

289
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,940
off the cliff.

290
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:36,740
Murong Bao!

291
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,830
That's not true!

292
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,550
She fell off herself.

293
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:40,640
That's right, Cousin.

294
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,410
Qing wouldn't have done that.

295
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:43,670
Don't misunderstand her.

296
00:13:55,260 --> 00:13:56,850
I'm scared.

297
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,760
Don't be afraid.

298
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,750
Thank you for saving Miss Zhuwan, Master Fu.

299
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:08,820
Don't tell me he's Fu Hong.

300
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,260
He's your future husband,

301
00:14:11,430 --> 00:14:12,730
Mr. Fu Hong.

302
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:17,010
You need to be careful around one person

303
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,650
in Mount Shengyue.

304
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:19,950
Who's it?

305
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,210
Mr. Fu Hong,

306
00:14:22,010 --> 00:14:23,650
the son of the Governor of Jian'an City.

307
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:25,250
He grew up with Master Chong.

308
00:14:25,250 --> 00:14:26,250
They're like brothers.

309
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:28,980
The famous Mr. Fu Hong?

310
00:14:29,280 --> 00:14:31,000
He's a legend,

311
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:32,970
one of the two most popular men in Mount Shengyue.

312
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,740
If you meet Mr. Fu,

313
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:36,000
you should try to get along well with him.

314
00:14:36,210 --> 00:14:37,090
Why?

315
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,360
Master Fu is your future husband.

316
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:41,250
You've been engaged since young.

317
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,680
I'm so lucky?

318
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,050
My word!

319
00:14:48,050 --> 00:14:50,820
He's graceful.

320
00:14:50,990 --> 00:14:52,960
But will he rat me out?

321
00:14:53,130 --> 00:14:54,180
Who can tell me

322
00:14:54,430 --> 00:14:55,610
what happened?

323
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:57,960
I don't dare to tell you.

324
00:14:58,050 --> 00:14:59,890
I'm afraid of being beaten by Qing.

325
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:04,890
She started it

326
00:15:04,890 --> 00:15:05,980
by taking my hairpin

327
00:15:06,110 --> 00:15:08,420
and fell off by herself.

328
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:09,970
Yes, Cousin.

329
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,650
It's just a misunderstanding.

330
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:14,220
Now that Zhuwan

331
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,690
has been saved by Mr. Fu,

332
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:18,040
let's put this matter behind us.

333
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,620
Yes, Cousin.

334
00:15:22,910 --> 00:15:23,830
Look at her.

335
00:15:24,090 --> 00:15:25,770
She's unscathed.

336
00:15:26,060 --> 00:15:27,190
Just let it slide.

337
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:36,350
It's good that she's fine.

338
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,690
If I hadn't been down there,

339
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:44,500
what would you do now?

340
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:48,230
Murong Zhuwan has mental issues

341
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:49,410
and barely knows about manners.

342
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:50,460
But no matter what,

343
00:15:50,590 --> 00:15:51,930
she's the Chief's daughter.

344
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:54,200
You guys can't bully her like that.

345
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,840
Chong.

346
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:58,520
She took my hairpin first.

347
00:15:58,520 --> 00:15:59,780
She even hit me just now.

348
00:15:59,910 --> 00:16:01,000
Qing.

349
00:16:01,630 --> 00:16:02,680
Say no more.

350
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,030
Murong Qing.

351
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,290
Apologize to Zhuwan.

352
00:16:05,450 --> 00:16:07,470
Why should I?

353
00:16:09,150 --> 00:16:10,200
Let's bring this matter

354
00:16:10,580 --> 00:16:12,220
to Dean Gao.

355
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:14,740
Qing.

356
00:16:14,950 --> 00:16:16,080
Mr. Fu is still here.

357
00:16:16,500 --> 00:16:17,510
If the Dean and the Chief

358
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,270
know about what happened,

359
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:21,500
the consequence will be unimaginable.

360
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:23,980
Why don't you

361
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:26,160
just apologize to her?

362
00:16:34,390 --> 00:16:35,440
Sorry.

363
00:16:37,420 --> 00:16:38,510
It's okay.

364
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:52,700
Xi.

365
00:16:53,710 --> 00:16:55,100
Take her back to change.

366
00:16:55,390 --> 00:16:56,440
Yes.

367
00:17:03,830 --> 00:17:04,500
Chong.

368
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:05,890
Long time no see.

369
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:08,700
Have you gotten better?

370
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:10,930
Mr. Yunhe has excellent medical skills.

371
00:17:11,060 --> 00:17:11,980
My illness

372
00:17:11,980 --> 00:17:13,200
has almost been cured.

373
00:17:15,089 --> 00:17:15,839
Let's go.

374
00:17:15,970 --> 00:17:16,940
Let's go.

375
00:17:18,410 --> 00:17:19,410
When I think of

376
00:17:19,410 --> 00:17:20,510
how Mr. Fu defended her,

377
00:17:20,630 --> 00:17:21,810
I feel so angry.

378
00:17:23,030 --> 00:17:24,660
We failed twice to embarrass her.

379
00:17:25,170 --> 00:17:25,800
On the contrary,

380
00:17:25,800 --> 00:17:26,550
she's gotten closer

381
00:17:26,550 --> 00:17:27,650
with Mr. Fu.

382
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:28,860
I can't believe it!

383
00:17:29,070 --> 00:17:30,420
Calm down.

384
00:17:30,670 --> 00:17:31,510
Dean Gao

385
00:17:31,510 --> 00:17:33,320
is a friend of the Chief.

386
00:17:33,320 --> 00:17:34,530
We must not

387
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,790
presume too much in front of him.

388
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:37,850
Qing.

389
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,240
Don't worry.

390
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:40,750
The day is still young.

391
00:17:40,870 --> 00:17:43,350
But Mr. Fu is so protective of her.

392
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,070
Murong Zhuwan is a lout

393
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,460
compared with you.

394
00:17:46,590 --> 00:17:47,850
You're pretty and elegant.

395
00:17:48,310 --> 00:17:49,360
She's his fiancée,

396
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:51,460
but that's just an empty title.

397
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,790
Murong Zhuwan

398
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,050
is different now,

399
00:17:58,260 --> 00:17:59,900
but no matter how she has changed,

400
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:00,910
I must

401
00:18:00,910 --> 00:18:02,590
teach her a lesson.

402
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:06,490
[Shengyue Academy]

403
00:18:13,130 --> 00:18:14,940
We all practice martial arts.

404
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:15,900
What's the use

405
00:18:16,450 --> 00:18:17,460
of learning these articles?

406
00:18:18,930 --> 00:18:19,720
You can leave

407
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,910
if you think they're useless.

408
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:34,840
You two go find a seat.

409
00:18:35,260 --> 00:18:36,230
-Okay. -Okay.

410
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:40,050
It's been many years.

411
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,320
You still haven't let it go.

412
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:45,300
It's just a childhood crush.

413
00:18:46,350 --> 00:18:47,400
Don't take it so seriously.

414
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,010
I was on the way to deliver goods with my father

415
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,280
when we encountered bandits.

416
00:18:53,700 --> 00:18:55,250
If Zhuwan hadn't shown up in time

417
00:18:56,350 --> 00:18:57,610
and chased them away with her internal force,

418
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,160
I'm afraid

419
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,290
I'd have been killed by those bandits.

420
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:01,970
She saved my life.

421
00:19:03,150 --> 00:19:04,830
How can I forget her kindness?

422
00:19:06,470 --> 00:19:07,900
She was just a little girl then.

423
00:19:08,110 --> 00:19:09,530
How come she was so powerful?

424
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,930
Maybe she's talented.

425
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:13,360
Unfortunately,

426
00:19:13,730 --> 00:19:15,580
a high fever fried her brain later.

427
00:19:41,070 --> 00:19:42,590
Rude man.

428
00:19:43,510 --> 00:19:44,480
Not as rude as you.

429
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,470
Everyone,

430
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,200
let's review

431
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,000
what we learned yesterday first.

432
00:19:53,930 --> 00:19:56,660
The aim is to learn from what you already know

433
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,180
and use it in everyday life.

434
00:20:00,230 --> 00:20:03,330
The Dao that can be told is not the eternal Dao.

435
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:07,580
The name that can be named is not the eternal name.

436
00:20:08,420 --> 00:20:11,440
Having no name, it's the origin of heaven and earth.

437
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:12,620
Hello, I'm Murong Zhuwan.

438
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:15,980
Having a name, it's the mother of all things.

439
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:16,980
My name is Murong Bao.

440
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:17,950
You can call me Bao.

441
00:20:18,200 --> 00:20:19,420
We met before.

442
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:23,700
Constantly with desire, there is the realization of potentiality.

443
00:20:25,890 --> 00:20:27,100
Everybody,

444
00:20:27,570 --> 00:20:31,680
write the poem we learned yesterday again.

445
00:20:34,290 --> 00:20:34,750
Here.

446
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:39,580
Thank you.

447
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:29,350
Realization of potentiality…

448
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:35,390
You draw so well.

449
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:37,100
Shhh.

450
00:21:40,140 --> 00:21:41,230
Wait a sec.

451
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:43,000
Aren't you a fool?

452
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:44,630
You don't look like one to me.

453
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:47,320
Actually,

454
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,210
I have

455
00:21:50,050 --> 00:21:52,030
intermittent mental disorders.

456
00:21:54,500 --> 00:21:56,560
Intermittent...

457
00:21:56,900 --> 00:21:57,650
What?

458
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,790
It basically means

459
00:21:58,910 --> 00:22:00,720
I'm not always a fool.

460
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:02,400
There are times when I'm normal.

461
00:22:05,590 --> 00:22:06,730
It's a secret.

462
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:08,110
Keep it between us.

463
00:22:15,290 --> 00:22:16,220
Are you hungry?

464
00:22:18,570 --> 00:22:19,580
A little.

465
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,620
Just one.

466
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:35,620
Thank you, Zhuwan.

467
00:22:35,910 --> 00:22:36,670
You're so nice.

468
00:22:37,050 --> 00:22:38,810
We're friends now.

469
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:41,060
Shhh.

470
00:23:06,660 --> 00:23:07,410
Chong.

471
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:08,420
Your lightness skill

472
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:09,470
has improved a lot.

473
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,490
You're a master of lightness skill.

474
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:12,870
Here.

475
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:15,520
I buried this Qionghua Wine

476
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,450
under a tree last year.

477
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:20,050
I wanted to drink it with you on the Mid-Autumn Festival,

478
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,190
but unexpectedly,

479
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:22,870
you went to Mount Rong for cultivation.

480
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:24,090
Now that you're back,

481
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:25,140
let's enjoy

482
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:26,860
this fine wine together.

483
00:23:27,570 --> 00:23:28,960
Hong, here's to you.

484
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:32,110
Thank you for saving Murong Zhuwan.

485
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,330
You're welcome.

486
00:23:34,630 --> 00:23:36,010
Zhuwan is my fiancée.

487
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,290
Hong,

488
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,180
if you think it's unfair,

489
00:23:41,350 --> 00:23:42,940
I can talk to my father for you

490
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,580
to break off the engagement.

491
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,190
It's already settled.

492
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:49,240
Hong,

493
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:52,020
if you don't want to marry her,

494
00:23:52,230 --> 00:23:53,440
you don't have to.

495
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:55,290
If you can't bring it up,

496
00:23:55,670 --> 00:23:56,510
I can do you a favor.

497
00:23:57,690 --> 00:23:58,360
Forget it.

498
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:00,420
We're here to drink today.

499
00:24:01,210 --> 00:24:01,590
Cheers.

500
00:24:01,590 --> 00:24:02,260
You're right.

501
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:03,480
Cheers.

502
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:15,320
Well…

503
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:20,150
Where are you taking me?

504
00:24:20,620 --> 00:24:21,330
Sorry.

505
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:22,250
I…

506
00:24:22,460 --> 00:24:23,600
I forgot the way.

507
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:26,920
Where…

508
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,060
Where are we?

509
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:32,040
Wait.

510
00:24:33,470 --> 00:24:34,640
Let's go over there.

511
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,740
Let's go.

512
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,450
They're Mr. Murong and Mr. Fu.

513
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:45,690
Cheers.

514
00:24:47,500 --> 00:24:48,250
Zhuwan.

515
00:24:48,630 --> 00:24:49,850
What are you looking at?

516
00:24:50,390 --> 00:24:52,410
What a beautiful picture!

517
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:54,680
Look at them.

518
00:24:57,410 --> 00:24:58,960
What a wonderful sight!

519
00:25:00,090 --> 00:25:01,440
Although Murong Chong

520
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:03,080
has a bad temper,

521
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,930
I have to admit that he's good-looking.

522
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,130
Why are you looking at me like that?

523
00:25:15,630 --> 00:25:16,940
I feel

524
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:18,780
that you're different from last year.

525
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:23,450
Then who do you prefer,

526
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:24,830
the me from last year,

527
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,470
or the me now?

528
00:25:26,600 --> 00:25:28,110
I like who you are now.

529
00:25:28,190 --> 00:25:28,780
You no longer

530
00:25:28,780 --> 00:25:29,580
let Murong Qing and the others pick on you.

531
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:30,330
Good point.

532
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:32,350
Who's there?

533
00:25:37,350 --> 00:25:38,520
My god!

534
00:25:38,520 --> 00:25:39,360
Get out!

535
00:25:39,830 --> 00:25:41,250
Acting time again.

536
00:25:55,910 --> 00:25:58,300
You're so handsome, Sir.

537
00:25:59,900 --> 00:26:00,700
Chong.

538
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:01,790
Let go of me!

539
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:03,130
Chong, Mr. Fu.

540
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:04,810
What are you doing here?

541
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:05,700
I was just

542
00:26:05,820 --> 00:26:07,420
showing Zhuwan around

543
00:26:07,590 --> 00:26:09,100
to help her get familiar with the environment.

544
00:26:09,390 --> 00:26:12,790
But we got lost.

545
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:14,730
You look far worse than the gentleman

546
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:15,520
over there.

547
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:16,530
Let go of me!

548
00:26:16,780 --> 00:26:17,540
Shut up!

549
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:18,930
Chong.

550
00:26:20,270 --> 00:26:21,530
Zhuwan is a girl.

551
00:26:21,820 --> 00:26:22,750
Don't be so rude to her.

552
00:26:22,870 --> 00:26:23,840
No.

553
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,520
I can't let her stain you.

554
00:26:26,020 --> 00:26:28,040
Help me, Sir!

555
00:26:30,350 --> 00:26:30,980
Come here!

556
00:26:31,110 --> 00:26:32,240
Like hell I will.

557
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:32,830
Like hell I will.

558
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:33,330
You…

559
00:26:36,060 --> 00:26:37,360
You can't catch me.

560
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:39,300
Have I gotten under your skin?

561
00:26:40,930 --> 00:26:41,480
You…

562
00:26:42,740 --> 00:26:43,710
Enough, Chong.

563
00:26:47,990 --> 00:26:48,700
I'm warning you.

564
00:26:48,870 --> 00:26:49,840
I can tell Mother tomorrow

565
00:26:49,920 --> 00:26:51,310
and ask her to send you back to Murong Mansion.

566
00:26:54,410 --> 00:26:56,180
You can't catch me and turn to your mother for help.

567
00:26:56,180 --> 00:26:57,770
How old are you?

568
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:58,820
I…

569
00:27:03,280 --> 00:27:03,990
Hong.

570
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:06,090
I'll take her back to Murong Mansion now.

571
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,010
Let's talk another day.

572
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,320
Let me send her back.

573
00:27:15,120 --> 00:27:17,220
You're so kind.

574
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,500
Let go!

575
00:27:20,500 --> 00:27:21,290
She doesn't deserve your escort.

576
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:22,180
Move!

577
00:27:23,980 --> 00:27:24,820
Let go of me!

578
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,290
Move!

579
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:27,300
Mr. Fu.

580
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:28,810
I…

581
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,910
I'm lost too!

582
00:27:40,380 --> 00:27:41,660
Let go of me!

583
00:27:41,870 --> 00:27:42,920
I can walk myself.

584
00:27:53,380 --> 00:27:54,510
You really should

585
00:27:54,510 --> 00:27:55,940
learn to take a hint.

586
00:27:56,150 --> 00:27:57,540
Just now, you should've left

587
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,970
me and Fu Hong alone.

588
00:27:59,090 --> 00:27:59,810
After all,

589
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,440
he's my fiancé.

590
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,040
Murong Zhuwan,

591
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,570
have you

592
00:28:06,650 --> 00:28:07,910
fallen in love with Hong?

593
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,380
Mr. Fu is handsome

594
00:28:09,550 --> 00:28:11,270
and from a great family. He's also good at martial arts.

595
00:28:11,480 --> 00:28:12,990
He's the kind of perfect man

596
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:14,880
every girl dreams of marrying

597
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:16,270
in romantic novels.

598
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,540
Any girl would like him.

599
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,710
I do like him. So what?

600
00:28:19,970 --> 00:28:21,100
Do you deserve him?

601
00:28:22,110 --> 00:28:23,870
Of course!

602
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:25,050
I'm a perfect match for him!

603
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,100
Listen.

604
00:28:26,100 --> 00:28:27,150
Mr. Fu is my fiancé.

605
00:28:27,230 --> 00:28:28,240
He'll be mine sooner or later.

606
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,210
Hong will in no way

607
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,350
like someone as shameless as you.

608
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:35,040
Listen.

609
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:36,180
Fu Hong

610
00:28:36,430 --> 00:28:37,520
will be my man!

611
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,210
You vulgar woman.

612
00:28:46,260 --> 00:28:47,520
You moody man.

613
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,540
You're the one who has mental issues.

614
00:29:02,970 --> 00:29:03,940
Murong Zhuwan has become

615
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:05,110
a completely different person.

616
00:29:05,740 --> 00:29:07,840
She didn't even recognize me.

617
00:29:08,890 --> 00:29:10,620
You're so handsome.

618
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,710
Are you married?

619
00:29:12,510 --> 00:29:14,400
You're so handsome.

620
00:29:19,180 --> 00:29:20,910
It's getting very interesting.

621
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,330
Perfect timing.

622
00:29:27,630 --> 00:29:29,010
Try my new tea.

623
00:29:41,020 --> 00:29:41,690
Young Master,

624
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:43,420
[Meng Tang, Fu Hong's guard]

625
00:29:42,200 --> 00:29:43,880
I've found that Her Ladyship's death

626
00:29:44,170 --> 00:29:46,100
might be related to the Murong family.

627
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:53,750
Go on.

628
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:55,760
An informant said

629
00:29:55,930 --> 00:29:56,900
he once saw a secret letter

630
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,410
from Jian'an City

631
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,090
in Chief Murong's study.

632
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,820
He didn't know the content though.

633
00:30:04,040 --> 00:30:05,800
Have you found

634
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:06,890
Mother's midwife back then?

635
00:30:07,230 --> 00:30:08,240
I've got clues.

636
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,620
I'll do my best to find her.

637
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:12,400
When you do,

638
00:30:13,030 --> 00:30:14,450
bring her to me immediately.

639
00:30:14,450 --> 00:30:15,040
Yes.

640
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:16,470
Wait.

641
00:30:17,810 --> 00:30:18,650
Tell Yu

642
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:19,960
to investigate Zhuwan.

643
00:30:20,170 --> 00:30:21,170
Remember.

644
00:30:21,680 --> 00:30:22,350
The Murong family

645
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:24,030
can't find out about it.

646
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:25,420
Yes, Young Master.

647
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,560
The Murong family raised me.

648
00:30:33,310 --> 00:30:35,160
What do they want?

649
00:30:36,630 --> 00:30:38,350
Mount Shengyue.

650
00:30:39,150 --> 00:30:40,530
Murong Chong.

651
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:45,490
Murong Zhuwan.

652
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,100
A man broke into Fuyun Pavilion last night?

653
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:35,470
He must be after the Manuals too.

654
00:31:37,320 --> 00:31:38,110
Any loss?

655
00:31:38,320 --> 00:31:39,670
Ji Lan stopped him in time.

656
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:41,310
That man got injured.

657
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:42,190
How's Ji Lan?

658
00:31:42,310 --> 00:31:43,410
His wrist was injured.

659
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,180
Father hasn't decided

660
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:47,520
when to end seclusion.

661
00:31:48,450 --> 00:31:49,620
Some people

662
00:31:50,380 --> 00:31:52,100
are starting to have nuisances again.
