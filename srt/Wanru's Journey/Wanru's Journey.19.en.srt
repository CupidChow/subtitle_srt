[Episode 19]

4
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:44,180
Lord Fu,

5
00:01:45,380 --> 00:01:46,100
you asked me to

6
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:47,259
secretly control Murong Chong's

7
00:01:47,539 --> 00:01:49,340
internal force before attacking the Murong family.

8
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,300
I've done it.

9
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:51,900
When will you

10
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:52,940
fulfill your promise

11
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:54,620
and let me marry into the Fu family?

12
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,180
Be patient.

13
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,660
I

14
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:00,820
arrange a residence

15
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:02,380
outside the mansion for you first.

16
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:03,940
Rest for a few days.

17
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,500
We'll discuss this

18
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,060
after the issue settles.

19
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:09,020
Lord Fu,

20
00:02:09,699 --> 00:02:11,380
are you going back on your word?

21
00:02:12,020 --> 00:02:12,660
Don't force me

22
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:13,980
to reveal the truth.

23
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:23,900
Qing.

24
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:25,300
Do you think I'm

25
00:02:25,420 --> 00:02:26,380
such a person?

26
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:28,260
Everyone in the world knows

27
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:29,340
I

28
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,380
always keep my word.

29
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,740
But

30
00:02:33,410 --> 00:02:35,260
the Murong family has just been wiped out.

31
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,570
If the Fu family

32
00:02:36,660 --> 00:02:38,140
holds a wedding now,

33
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:40,780
people will gossip.

34
00:02:41,780 --> 00:02:42,450
Qing,

35
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,980
Don't worry.

36
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:45,380
You

37
00:02:45,980 --> 00:02:46,820
will be

38
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,940
my daughter-in-law.

39
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,140
Then...

40
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:55,860
Uncle Sou

41
00:02:57,540 --> 00:02:58,820
it's all up to you.

42
00:02:59,100 --> 00:02:59,980
I'll leave now.

43
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:45,820
Murong Wei.

44
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:51,060
What do you want?

45
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:13,700
Brother.

46
00:04:15,500 --> 00:04:16,300
Miss, you...

47
00:04:18,579 --> 00:04:18,899
Brother.

48
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,019
Master Murong did not become a demon.

49
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:22,540
Brother, have you gone crazy too?

50
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,620
Don't judge a book by its cover.

51
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,900
How much do you know

52
00:04:27,220 --> 00:04:28,180
about the martial arts world?

53
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,500
Don't cause trouble here.

54
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,340
Me?

55
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:32,700
Where is Murong Chong?

56
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,380
I want to see him.

57
00:04:34,140 --> 00:04:34,540
He's dead.

58
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,460
I don't believe it.

59
00:04:36,140 --> 00:04:36,659
How could someone like him

60
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,610
die?

61
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:39,700
I want to see him! I want to see him!

62
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:42,540
This is not a place for you to mess around.

63
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:43,700
Meng Tang.

64
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:44,659
Governor.

65
00:04:45,580 --> 00:04:46,340
Take her away.

66
00:04:47,050 --> 00:04:48,820
The world is complicated now.

67
00:04:49,340 --> 00:04:50,380
Don't let her wander around.

68
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:51,340
Yes, Governor.

69
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:52,500
Miss.

70
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:56,220
Brother.

71
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:58,740
How did you become like this?

72
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,660
Brother.

73
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,100
Are you still my brother?

74
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,060
Take her away.

What?

77
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,100
Yao sneaked out?

78
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:32,820
Get her back!

79
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:33,820
Yes.

80
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:51,980
Stop the carriage!

81
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,020
Stop!

82
00:05:55,860 --> 00:05:56,380
Chong.

83
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:57,100
Zhuwan.

84
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:00,580
Yao.

85
00:06:07,940 --> 00:06:08,980
Chong will get better,

86
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:09,740
right?

87
00:06:10,060 --> 00:06:11,220
It's not good.

88
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,500
Luckily, I met you.

89
00:06:21,140 --> 00:06:21,580
Boss,

90
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:22,940
can you

91
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,540
give me a bun?

92
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,980
Get lost! Stay away from me!

93
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,060
Stinky beggar!

94
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:32,180
Murong Bao.

95
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,300
Governor.

96
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:38,060
What should we do

97
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:39,290
with the remnants of the Murong family?

98
00:06:40,420 --> 00:06:41,370
Of course you should

99
00:06:41,659 --> 00:06:42,420
deal with the remnants of

100
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,100
the Murong family.

101
00:06:43,340 --> 00:06:43,540
Okay.

102
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:44,820
As long as you don't kill him.

103
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,900
Why?

104
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,860
I heard that Murong Bao's father

105
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:50,140
loved collecting classical manuals.

106
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:51,100
Maybe he knows

107
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:52,420
where the Shanhai Secret Manual is.

108
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,659
Hong is right.

109
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:57,220
Let's do as you say.

110
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,810
Thank you, Uncle Sou.

111
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:00,020
I'm going to look for Yaoyao.

112
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:00,460
Okay.

113
00:07:10,540 --> 00:07:11,460
Why did it stop?

114
00:07:16,540 --> 00:07:17,100
Meng Tang.

115
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:18,460
Get out of my way!

116
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,060
Miss, calm down.

117
00:07:22,570 --> 00:07:23,540
Governor is on his way.

118
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:26,620
Who's in the carriage?

119
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:27,500
Don't come over!

120
00:07:36,380 --> 00:07:36,820
Don't move!

121
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:39,140
Don't come over.

122
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:41,460
I don't want to die.

123
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,700
As long as you let us go,

124
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,780
I won't hurt Miss Fu.

125
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:04,980
Let's go.

126
00:08:15,420 --> 00:08:16,540
Yao, get off.

127
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,100
I'll take him to a place

128
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:19,140
to receive treatment as soon as possible.

129
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:20,980
Take me with you.

130
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:23,060
If someone finds out on the way,

131
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,860
you can kidnap me anytime.

132
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:25,610
Yao,

133
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,700
you're a good girl.

134
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:29,810
It's too dangerous to stay with us.

135
00:08:30,420 --> 00:08:30,980
No.

136
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:32,500
I'm willing to help you.

137
00:09:06,260 --> 00:09:06,820
Drop your bows.

138
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,340
Be careful not to hurt Yaoyao.

139
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,300
Brother.

140
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:24,260
Where are Chong and Zhuwan?

141
00:09:26,940 --> 00:09:29,260
They left me behind and ran away.

142
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:25,980
No.

143
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:27,890
Murong Chong.

144
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:28,700
If you go on like this,

145
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:29,900
you won't be able to make it.

146
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:36,900
You're awake.

147
00:10:39,860 --> 00:10:40,980
How do you feel now?

148
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:43,250
Zhuwan.

149
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:46,180
Wait.

150
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:47,620
Medicine.

151
00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:55,220
Take the medicine,

152
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,740
it'll protect your pulse.

153
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,460
Wait for me.

154
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:55,700
Murong Chong.

155
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,180
Eat something.

156
00:12:06,250 --> 00:12:06,940
There's still some distance

157
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,300
to Mount Jiuju.

158
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:10,380
If you're like this, you can't hold on.

159
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:19,380
Murong Chong,

160
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:22,100
take a bite.

161
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:29,700
Murong Chong.

162
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,250
Pull yourself together.

163
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,460
The Murong family was wiped out.

164
00:12:35,580 --> 00:12:36,940
Are you going to let it go?

165
00:12:38,540 --> 00:12:39,780
The entire Murong family

166
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,540
and the whole Su family.

167
00:12:42,420 --> 00:12:44,540
We must take revenge for them.

168
00:12:46,020 --> 00:12:46,810
Don't forget

169
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,380
your mother died to save you.

170
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,260
If your mother sees

171
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,180
you like this,

172
00:12:52,340 --> 00:12:53,140
she'll rise from her grave

173
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,580
and slap you.

174
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,540
But my mother died

175
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:02,340
because of me.

176
00:13:07,610 --> 00:13:08,500
Murong Chong.

177
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:10,620
Look at me.

178
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,020
As long as we're alive,

179
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:16,580
there will be hope.

180
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:18,580
You have to pull yourself together

181
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:19,700
to take revenge.

182
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:23,620
Mother's whole life

183
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:27,100
was dedicated to me.

184
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:33,460
She told me to get the Shanhai Secret Manual

185
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:36,900
and the position of Chief

186
00:13:38,490 --> 00:13:39,620
for my sake.

187
00:13:42,740 --> 00:13:44,020
Now because of me,

188
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,660
she's gone.

189
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,420
The Murong family is gone too.

190
00:13:51,140 --> 00:13:52,340
There's nothing left.

191
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,660
Zhuwan.

192
00:13:58,420 --> 00:14:00,060
I have nothing.

193
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:05,940
You still have me.

194
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:10,420
They all left.

195
00:14:11,260 --> 00:14:12,460
No matter what happens,

196
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,980
you will leave too.

197
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:16,420
I won't leave you.

198
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,020
I'll help you rebuild the Murong family

199
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:21,580
and clear your name.

200
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:44,460
Zhuwan.

201
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:54,940
[Wei Family's Inn]

202
00:15:10,180 --> 00:15:11,260
Murong Chong has turned insane

203
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:12,220
after practising demonic art.

204
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,700
After this meal,

205
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,460
you should stay in the inn.

206
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,980
Don't go out.

207
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:17,890
No.

208
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Chong is not a bad guy.

209
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:21,140
He's not insane.

210
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,980
I think you're out of your mind.

211
00:15:23,420 --> 00:15:24,780
The entire Murong family has been wiped out.

212
00:15:25,300 --> 00:15:26,820
Murong Chong is a remnant of the Murong family.

213
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:27,860
It's very dangerous.

214
00:15:28,340 --> 00:15:29,500
You must not contact him.

215
00:15:29,780 --> 00:15:30,260
Brother,

216
00:15:30,930 --> 00:15:32,660
I think you're the one who lost your mind.

217
00:15:33,700 --> 00:15:34,620
When the Sun family was wiped out,

218
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,100
Chong was in Jian'an City.

219
00:15:36,660 --> 00:15:38,020
You knew he didn't do it.

220
00:15:38,140 --> 00:15:39,180
Why didn't you say anything?

221
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,660
Is it because of Zhuwan?

222
00:15:49,100 --> 00:15:50,380
How could you do this?

223
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:52,540
How did you become like this?

224
00:15:53,260 --> 00:15:54,180
I know what to do.

225
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,100
Leave.

226
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:56,660
Fu Hong.

227
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,380
Father has taught us

228
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:00,300
to be honest and just.

229
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:02,180
Look at you now.

230
00:16:02,900 --> 00:16:03,420
Yaoyao.

231
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,620
How dare you talk to your brother like that?

232
00:16:14,260 --> 00:16:14,900
That child...

233
00:16:21,300 --> 00:16:21,820
Hong.

234
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,140
Yaoyao is young.

235
00:16:23,460 --> 00:16:24,180
She can't tell

236
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,180
what's going on.

237
00:16:25,820 --> 00:16:27,220
Don't lower yourself to her level.

238
00:16:29,860 --> 00:16:30,700
She's an adult

239
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:31,850
but still acts like a child.

240
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,420
When we go back to Jian'an City,

241
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,660
we should find her a good family

242
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:35,260
to marry.

243
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:37,700
Okay.

244
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:51,660
Zhuwan.

245
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,140
Are you okay?

246
00:16:58,540 --> 00:16:59,020
I...

247
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:04,420
No.

248
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,460
With your current state,

249
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:07,660
you won't be able to walk for long.

250
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:21,540
What are you doing?

251
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,260
I'm giving you some internal power.

252
00:17:25,060 --> 00:17:25,780
Sit tight.

253
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,500
No.

254
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:31,130
Your internal force is unstructured.

255
00:17:31,620 --> 00:17:33,500
You'll hurt yourself if you give it to me.

256
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,220
Have you forgotten that I'm gifted?

257
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,620
Don't worry.

258
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,500
Be careful.

259
00:17:41,060 --> 00:17:41,580
Don't worry.

260
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:42,980
I know what to do.

261
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,340
Zhuwan.

262
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:33,580
Zhuwan.

263
00:18:48,980 --> 00:18:50,260
I think I'm heating up a little.

264
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,940
You're already in this state.

265
00:18:54,180 --> 00:18:55,300
Are you still going to act tough?

266
00:18:55,780 --> 00:18:56,820
Don't worry about me.

267
00:18:58,420 --> 00:18:58,900
I'm fine.

268
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:00,540
Zhuwan.

269
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,100
I'm sorry.

270
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:06,500
My parents are gone.

271
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:09,180
You don't have to pretend to be Zhuwan anymore.

272
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:11,940
I have some money here.

273
00:19:13,820 --> 00:19:14,340
Have you forgotten

274
00:19:14,490 --> 00:19:15,460
what I said yesterday?

275
00:19:17,020 --> 00:19:18,290
Keep your money.

276
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,940
Don't say such stupid things again.

277
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:28,380
Zhuwan.

278
00:19:30,940 --> 00:19:31,940
Listen to me.

279
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:34,140
I have nothing left.

280
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:35,700
The whole world

281
00:19:35,780 --> 00:19:36,980
views me as a demon.

282
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,340
You can cut all ties

283
00:19:38,500 --> 00:19:39,780
with the Murong family.

284
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:41,620
Say no more.

285
00:19:41,980 --> 00:19:42,780
I won't leave.

286
00:19:45,340 --> 00:19:45,860
Zhuwan.

287
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,580
In this world,

288
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:50,340
besides my father and my mother,

289
00:19:51,540 --> 00:19:53,020
you are the person I care about the most.

290
00:19:54,820 --> 00:19:55,660
I like you.

291
00:19:56,980 --> 00:19:58,700
But I can't be selfish and drag you down.

292
00:20:00,820 --> 00:20:01,500
Please.

293
00:20:02,580 --> 00:20:03,580
Stop following me.

294
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:16,620
You want to drive me away?

295
00:20:16,940 --> 00:20:17,330
Fine.

296
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,450
After I die,

297
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:21,260
you can leave me anywhere.

298
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:22,940
I won't follow you.

299
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:55,940
How are you?

300
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,060
Hang in there.

301
00:21:03,180 --> 00:21:03,500
Stop!

302
00:21:04,460 --> 00:21:05,420
Where are you two from?

303
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:21,010
Miss Fu.

304
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:22,660
They are my friends.

305
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:23,500
No need to investigate.

306
00:21:23,940 --> 00:21:24,220
Yes.

307
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:30,780
Let's go.

308
00:21:32,220 --> 00:21:32,700
Governor.

309
00:21:33,580 --> 00:21:34,620
Our brothers from Xianruo Pavilion

310
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,340
died in the battle

311
00:21:36,770 --> 00:21:37,620
of Mount Shengyue.

312
00:21:42,740 --> 00:21:43,740
Where are their remains?

313
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:45,220
Their remains

314
00:21:45,660 --> 00:21:46,540
have been brought back.

315
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:48,980
Bury them well.

316
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,420
Take good care of their family.

317
00:21:52,780 --> 00:21:53,140
Yes.

318
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:54,850
You may leave.

319
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:56,220
Yes.

320
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:16,900
Chong.

321
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,580
Zhuwan.

322
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,620
Master Chong.

323
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,690
Chong.

324
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:23,850
Why are you here?

325
00:22:24,220 --> 00:22:25,940
I met them in Han City.

326
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,210
I guessed they were here to find you

327
00:22:27,300 --> 00:22:28,140
and Chong.

328
00:22:28,380 --> 00:22:29,180
So I brought them here

329
00:22:29,290 --> 00:22:30,180
to look for you.

330
00:22:31,580 --> 00:22:31,900
This...

331
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,290
This is the elixir I brought

332
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,260
from home.

333
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:35,780
You should see

334
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:37,780
if Chong needs it.

335
00:22:39,100 --> 00:22:39,540
Thank you.

336
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:41,490
Xi Feng.

337
00:22:42,130 --> 00:22:42,820
How are you?

338
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:43,860
I'm fine.

339
00:22:45,380 --> 00:22:46,530
Sit down and take a rest.

340
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,500
Okay.

341
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:51,860
Have a rest.

342
00:22:52,260 --> 00:22:53,780
I'll go pick some wild fruits for you.

343
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:54,420
Okay.

344
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,860
I'll check the river again.

345
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:19,700
Xi You.

346
00:23:26,890 --> 00:23:27,730
What's wrong?

347
00:23:29,260 --> 00:23:29,700
Nothing.

348
00:23:30,180 --> 00:23:31,380
I'm just worried about my brother.

349
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,780
I'll check over there.

350
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:45,780
Lord Fu.

351
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,180
I wonder

352
00:23:51,620 --> 00:23:53,140
what can I do for you?

353
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,380
It's my duty to get rid of the demon.

354
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,100
I'm willing to help you.

355
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:58,980
My father was killed by the Murong family.

356
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:00,820
I will definitely not forgive

357
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,140
the Murong family.

358
00:24:04,860 --> 00:24:06,220
Chief Jian and Master Wei

359
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,340
are young heroes

360
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,540
and fearless.

361
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:10,570
It's a great fortune for the world.

362
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:13,140
With your help,

363
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:15,900
Murong Chong will be captured sooner or later.

364
00:24:16,580 --> 00:24:18,340
Fu Hong and Murong Chong have been friends since childhood.

365
00:24:18,620 --> 00:24:19,380
Who knows if he will be

366
00:24:19,460 --> 00:24:20,220
soft-hearted

367
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:21,730
and biased?

368
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:23,500
Lord Fu.

369
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:24,860
That's not what he meant.

370
00:24:27,380 --> 00:24:30,020
I understand your intentions.

371
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:31,300
Deputy Governor.

372
00:24:36,420 --> 00:24:37,780
We'll leave now.

373
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,420
Please.

374
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:46,090
Deputy Governor,

375
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:48,740
the Heavens are helping you.

376
00:24:49,140 --> 00:24:49,780
We found

377
00:24:49,780 --> 00:24:50,820
Murong Chong.

378
00:24:51,300 --> 00:24:52,660
If we catch Murong Chong,

379
00:24:53,020 --> 00:24:54,380
your status in the martial arts world

380
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,340
will be elevated.

381
00:25:00,340 --> 00:25:00,940
Guards!

382
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,020
Yes.

383
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:03,940
Give the order

384
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:05,700
to capture Murong Chong alive.

385
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:08,140
The rest will be killed without mercy.

386
00:25:08,460 --> 00:25:08,700
Yes.

387
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,260
Wait.

388
00:25:11,420 --> 00:25:12,060
Deputy Governor,

389
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:13,940
Fu Yao is still staying

390
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:14,740
with them.

391
00:25:39,860 --> 00:25:40,660
So far?

392
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,700
Why haven't we arrived yet?

393
00:25:43,980 --> 00:25:44,420
Stop!

394
00:26:00,020 --> 00:26:01,020
They're friends.

395
00:26:06,140 --> 00:26:06,660
Stop!

396
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:09,060
Don't you know who I am?

397
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:11,300
Get lost!

398
00:26:17,290 --> 00:26:18,220
Stop!

399
00:26:18,420 --> 00:26:19,540
I'm Fu Yao.

400
00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:22,980
Run!

401
00:26:27,020 --> 00:26:27,540
Hide.

402
00:28:08,100 --> 00:28:08,780
The path that we took

403
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,900
was well-concealed.

404
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:11,540
We only chose hidden trails along the mountain.

405
00:28:12,100 --> 00:28:13,420
Why are we suddenly found?

406
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,140
There's a traitor!
