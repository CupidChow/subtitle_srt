more expensive

00:17:19,020 --> 00:17:19,849
Goodbye, Madam.

383
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:25,940
Miss,

384
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:28,220
let me ask you a question.

385
00:17:31,580 --> 00:17:32,340
Where is this?

386
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,140
This is Murong Mansion

387
00:17:36,420 --> 00:17:37,340
Which Murong?

388
00:17:37,820 --> 00:17:39,660
The current Chief of the Martial Arts World's residence.

389
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:40,940
Xi Feng.

390
00:17:41,540 --> 00:17:42,060
Don't let anyone

391
00:17:42,220 --> 00:17:43,620
know about this.

392
00:17:44,220 --> 00:17:45,420
Don't leave any witnesses.

393
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:47,900
Murong Chong's family.

394
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,820
I'm going to lose my life.

395
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:55,500
Murong Mansion

396
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:58,930
is indeed magnificent

397
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:00,500
and glorious.

398
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,660
My stomach suddenly hurts.

399
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:03,940
I need to go to the toilet.

400
00:18:08,060 --> 00:18:09,650
If you want to go to the toilet,

401
00:18:10,050 --> 00:18:11,300
there is a bucket in the room.

402
00:18:12,540 --> 00:18:13,460
Do I need to

403
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,020
bring the bucket to you?

404
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,010
No need.

405
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,250
There's no need.

406
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,380
Why did they dress me up like this?

407
00:18:59,100 --> 00:19:01,300
Does Zhuwan look like that?

408
00:19:02,660 --> 00:19:03,660
No, no, no.

409
00:19:05,130 --> 00:19:06,140
I need to figure it out.

410
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,460
This old witch obviously

411
00:19:09,580 --> 00:19:11,420
wants me to play the role of Zhuwan.

412
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:15,140
She must be up to something.

413
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:23,580
This lady

414
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,420
must be here to spy on me.

415
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,860
I have to find a way to escape.

416
00:19:38,060 --> 00:19:39,260
Madam, the Daoist priest is here.

417
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:41,050
Okay.

418
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,500
You may leave.

419
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:43,740
Yes, Madam.

420
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,140
Madam Murong.

421
00:19:53,940 --> 00:19:54,460
Senior.

422
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,900
Are you ready?

423
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:00,730
[Master Yunhe]

424
00:20:06,050 --> 00:20:08,060
The martial arts ability of the lady beside me

425
00:20:08,060 --> 00:20:09,260
is far above me.

426
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,260
I have to come up with a plan.

427
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,100
Miss,

428
00:20:17,860 --> 00:20:19,290
let me ask you something.

429
00:20:21,260 --> 00:20:22,980
How many siblings do I have?

430
00:20:23,620 --> 00:20:24,660
You have an older brother,

431
00:20:24,860 --> 00:20:25,580
Murong Wei.

432
00:20:26,340 --> 00:20:27,820
He's the son of the former Madam.

433
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:30,450
You also have a younger brother of the same age.

434
00:20:30,700 --> 00:20:31,490
Murong Chong.

435
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:33,300
He's the son of the current Madam.

436
00:20:37,180 --> 00:20:40,780
One is the son of the former wife,

437
00:20:41,540 --> 00:20:43,940
and the other is the son of the current wife.

438
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:46,380
Who gave birth to me?

439
00:20:48,290 --> 00:20:49,140
You are the daughter of the Chief's

440
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:50,340
concubine.

441
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,660
What about my mother?

442
00:20:52,980 --> 00:20:54,500
She passed away early.

443
00:20:56,290 --> 00:20:56,980
One more thing.

444
00:20:57,900 --> 00:20:59,980
Zhuwan is mentally unwell due to illness when she was young.

445
00:21:00,860 --> 00:21:02,940
That's why she's slower than others.

446
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:05,620
Normally, she's timid when she sees someone.

447
00:21:07,420 --> 00:21:08,780
Your reaction right now

448
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:10,660
is too fast.

449
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,210
According to you,

450
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:18,060
I'm not only an illegitimate child,

451
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,940
but also a fool.

452
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,300
My fate is seems to be quite rough.

453
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,940
It's hard to make a living in Murong Mansion.

454
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,420
For now,

455
00:21:29,860 --> 00:21:31,180
I should find a way to escape.

456
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:39,540
The Blood Poison Technique is horrendous.

457
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:41,500
It hasn’t appeared for 100 years.

458
00:21:42,420 --> 00:21:43,860
On the night of the full moon,

459
00:21:44,210 --> 00:21:45,740
this slab will absorb the essence of the moon

460
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,980
and protect the pulse of the person who receives blood transfusion.

461
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:51,060
The blood transfusion needs to be done

462
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:52,020
before midnight.

463
00:21:52,580 --> 00:21:54,460
If the blood transfusion is interrupted,

464
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:57,100
it'll endanger the life of the person receiving blood transfusion.

465
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,580
We need a guardian to cast protective spells.

466
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,580
I'll do it myself.

467
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,420
Chong is my life.

468
00:22:05,010 --> 00:22:06,140
I'll entrust my life

469
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,730
to you.

470
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:10,940
Mount Shengyue is a forbidden area.

471
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:13,020
Without my order,

472
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:16,060
disciples of the Shengyue Sect don't dare to enter.

473
00:22:17,140 --> 00:22:17,820
Let's begin.

474
00:23:03,620 --> 00:23:05,140
This doesn't count as stealing.

475
00:23:05,620 --> 00:23:07,180
I've been acting as Zhuwan for so long.

476
00:23:07,340 --> 00:23:08,620
This counts as my wage.

477
00:23:09,530 --> 00:23:11,540
That lady is nothing much after all.

478
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,780
She can't withstand my sleeping gas.

479
00:23:20,620 --> 00:23:22,820
How big is this Murong Mansion?

480
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:24,780
Where is the exit?

481
00:23:30,740 --> 00:23:31,180
Who are you?

482
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:31,980
Stop!

483
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,530
Stop!

484
00:23:44,660 --> 00:23:45,500
Hurry! After her!

485
00:23:49,780 --> 00:23:50,460
Senior Xi Feng!

486
00:23:51,420 --> 00:23:51,900
What happened?

487
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:53,140
A thief broke into Mount Shengyue

488
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,340
and ran to the forbidden area behind the mountain.

489
00:23:54,930 --> 00:23:55,300
Go!

490
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:43,880
[Mount Shengyue Forbidden Area]

491
00:24:50,220 --> 00:24:51,250
Senior, what should we do?

492
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:53,980
We broke into the forbidden area by mistake.

493
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,420
Report to Madam. Go!

494
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:57,580
Yes, Senior.

495
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,820
I'm exhausted.

496
00:25:09,580 --> 00:25:10,500
If I knew this would happen,

497
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,890
I should have listened to master

498
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,180
and practised martial arts.

499
00:25:18,770 --> 00:25:19,780
Murong Chong's family

500
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:20,660
are so stingy.

501
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,180
I only stole a few things

502
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,100
and they sent so many people to catch me.

503
00:25:25,580 --> 00:25:26,330
Wait.

504
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:28,820
Don't people from

505
00:25:28,980 --> 00:25:30,700
Mount Shengyue wear white clothes?

506
00:25:31,180 --> 00:25:32,860
They don't seem to be on the same side.

507
00:25:35,820 --> 00:25:37,020
I don't care anymore.

508
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,530
It's not safe here.

509
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,460
I should go.

510
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:57,100
Madam Murong?

511
00:25:57,780 --> 00:25:58,540
It's the middle of the night

512
00:25:58,940 --> 00:26:00,460
and she's here in the forest?

513
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:02,580
Could she be meeting an old lover?

514
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,100
Don't look. Don't look.

515
00:26:11,780 --> 00:26:14,380
The Murong family has so many secrets.

516
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:15,900
Looks like I can get another

517
00:26:15,980 --> 00:26:16,980
big scoop tonight.

518
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,380
Why does this lady

519
00:26:24,460 --> 00:26:25,900
look like me?

520
00:26:28,460 --> 00:26:29,300
Oh my god.

521
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,140
Isn't that the feeble guy?

522
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:38,420
Is this the legendary

523
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,740
one-for-one?

524
00:26:40,730 --> 00:26:42,380
Who are they going to change?

525
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,140
How is it?

526
00:27:00,900 --> 00:27:02,820
After the blood transfusion,

527
00:27:03,300 --> 00:27:06,060
the Blood Poison has been cured.

528
00:27:07,820 --> 00:27:10,820
But Miss Zhuwan...

529
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,900
For Chong,

530
00:27:17,860 --> 00:27:19,300
I have no choice.

531
00:27:22,980 --> 00:27:25,020
So the real Zhuwan is here.

532
00:27:25,490 --> 00:27:26,380
Is she...

533
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:29,220
When will Chong wake up?

534
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:32,380
It depends on his fate.

535
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:40,580
So she kidnapped me

536
00:27:40,980 --> 00:27:42,730
to replace Zhuwan.

537
00:28:02,140 --> 00:28:02,620
Senior.

538
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,060
Protect Chong.

539
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,540
No one can leave here today.

540
00:28:53,020 --> 00:28:54,260
Madam Murong

541
00:28:54,500 --> 00:28:56,380
is really scary.

542
00:29:47,660 --> 00:29:48,220
Chong!

543
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,740
Luckily, he's still breathing.

544
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:37,060
I'm not a kind person.

545
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:38,860
If the protagonist dies,

546
00:30:39,020 --> 00:30:39,780
how can my novels continue

547
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,420
to be published in the future?

548
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:50,900
How dare you!

549
00:30:54,810 --> 00:30:55,540
You want to die?

550
00:31:14,500 --> 00:31:16,180
This villain role I'm playing

551
00:31:16,340 --> 00:31:18,660
is not grand at all.

552
00:31:19,540 --> 00:31:21,620
To save you,

553
00:31:22,970 --> 00:31:25,460
my wages were blown up.

554
00:31:41,620 --> 00:31:43,060
I can't save you for nothing.

555
00:32:11,020 --> 00:32:11,540
Bro.

556
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:14,380
This is getting awkward.
