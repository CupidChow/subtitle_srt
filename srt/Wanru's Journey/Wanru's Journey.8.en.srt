Ginseng chicken soup.

00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:54,300
Why did you come in?

6
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,280
I saw nothing.

7
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,350
Saw nothing.

8
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:01,460
-Saw nothing. -Get out.

9
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,390
Saw nothing.

10
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:03,700
I'll go out now.

11
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:05,780
Master Chong.

12
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:06,550
An urgent report.

13
00:02:08,780 --> 00:02:10,100
Find a place to hide yourself.

Young Master.

15
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:30,110
A secret report.

16
00:02:30,340 --> 00:02:32,230
Zhang is dead.

Murong Chong.

18
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:42,860
You don't deserve to be a member of a noble family.

19
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:44,090
Didn't you say you had locked her up?

20
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:44,970
How could you even kill

21
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:45,579
a woman?

22
00:02:45,579 --> 00:02:46,780
You disregard human lives!

23
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:47,780
I'll leave.

27
00:02:53,420 --> 00:02:54,380
As a man,

28
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:56,060
-you dared to do it but you don't dare to admit it? -Zhang...

29
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,700
You...

30
00:02:56,900 --> 00:02:58,000
You did such a despicable

31
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:58,840
-and dirty thing. -Come out!

32
00:02:58,840 --> 00:02:59,660
Then why did you...

You...

39
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:29,620
I didn't expect that

40
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:32,820
Chong had known about it.

41
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,460
You...

42
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,510
Let go of me!

43
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:42,860
What do you want to do?

44
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,610
I advise you not to forget

45
00:03:44,610 --> 00:03:45,500
my identity.

46
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,780
Let me tell you again.

47
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,430
I didn't kill Zhang.

48
00:03:51,620 --> 00:03:52,310
Nonsense!

49
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:54,100
If you didn't kill her, then who killed her?

50
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:55,030
Who else could it be?

51
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:56,130
On the second day after Zhang came,

52
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:56,710
she died.

53
00:03:57,460 --> 00:03:58,210
Now I also don't know

54
00:03:58,210 --> 00:03:59,140
who killed her.

55
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,460
I reasonably suspect that you're lying.

56
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,340
Let me tell you one last time.

57
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,340
I didn't kill Zhang.

58
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:06,260
If you didn't kill her,

59
00:04:06,260 --> 00:04:07,220
your mother must have killed her.

60
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:08,090
I...

61
00:04:08,090 --> 00:04:09,970
I don't want to hear it.

62
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,060
I won't listen.

63
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:21,209
How come you have

64
00:04:21,209 --> 00:04:22,110
Hong's jade pendant?

65
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,340
None of your business.

66
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,980
It's the engagement token, okay?

67
00:04:29,540 --> 00:04:30,070
Give it back to me.

68
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,690
Why should I give my own stuff

69
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:33,540
back to you?

70
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,620
Give it back to me!

71
00:04:42,980 --> 00:04:43,550
What are you doing?

72
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:45,230
If you

73
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,420
don't leave,

00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:56,350

79
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:57,540
How unreasonable!

00:05:16,340 --> 00:05:16,900
Her Ladyship.

82
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:21,940
You also suspect that my mother killed her?

83
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:23,030
I guessed it.

84
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:27,900
I have something to tell you.

85
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:30,940

Yes.

94

Those who achieve great things

107

109
00:06:49,250 --> 00:06:50,670
killed Zhang

110
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:52,700
to protect you.

111
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,110
Chong has been kind-hearted since childhood.

112
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,260
I'm glad that he has made

113
00:06:58,420 --> 00:07:01,340
such a decision.

116
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:17,460
Since you know about what happened to Zhuwan,

117
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:19,270
don't tell anyone about it.

for the preparation of the survival drill.

whenever we buy things,

139
00:08:50,570 --> 00:08:51,540
we've bought two for the same product.

Here you are.

150
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:14,700
By the way, Hong,

151
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:16,210
I already know that

152
00:09:16,210 --> 00:09:17,350
you lost the jade pendant.

153
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:22,100
I'll definitely help you find it.

154
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:24,820
You know that?

155
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,340
Zhuwan stole it again.

156
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:29,660
That's too much.

157
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:31,830
Chong.

158
00:09:32,940 --> 00:09:33,410
Don't

159
00:09:33,410 --> 00:09:34,500
give Zhuwan a hard time.

160
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,350
You're right.

161
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,100
She's not important indeed.

162
00:09:41,010 --> 00:09:41,540
By the way,

163
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:44,630
yesterday at the foot of the mountain, I heard that

164
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,620
there had been a powerful organization emerging in the city recently,

165
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,300
which is called Hidden Blade.

166
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:49,580
It is extremely dangerous.

167
00:09:50,100 --> 00:09:51,300
There is also a mysterious organization

168
00:09:51,580 --> 00:09:53,980
called Xianruo Pavilion.

169
00:09:54,820 --> 00:09:55,820
It also appears and disappears mysteriously.

170
00:09:56,580 --> 00:09:57,810
It's surprising that Xi Feng couldn't find

171
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:58,860
any trace of them.

172
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,630
It's very suspicious.

173
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:02,380
Hong,

174
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:03,990
have you ever heard of them?

175
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,620
No, I haven't.

176
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,790
Now the Martial Arts World is not peaceful again.

177
00:10:12,020 --> 00:10:12,760
I guess they both came here

178
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,900
for the Shanhai Secret Manual.

179
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,390
Hong,

as the heir of the governor

181
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,640
of Jian'an City,

182
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:19,410
you must ensure

183
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:20,350
your own safety.

184
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:21,670
How about

185
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,780
you and Zhuwan swap your rooms?

186
00:10:24,180 --> 00:10:25,060
I'll feel more relieved

187
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,180
if you live in the room next to mine.

188
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,140
I can take good care of myself.

189
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:31,420
Zhuwan is a girl after all.

190
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:33,190
You should take care of her more.

191
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:34,070
Her?

192
00:10:34,820 --> 00:10:35,710
If anything happens to her,

193
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:37,390
she's very good at running away.

She's your sister after all.

195
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,740

your son.

205

He has been gone for ten years.

As his uncle,

207
00:11:11,740 --> 00:11:13,420
I can't bear to see that.

208
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:17,420
If it weren't for him,

Well...

00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:29,340
Hong is innocent.

217
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:32,270

What should we do next?

223
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,070
Something is fishy about this.

224
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,780
If the Murong Family really did it,

225
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:56,940
they would have cleaned all the traces.

226
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:57,970
It's impossible that they would let

Lord Fu, you're too kind.

287
00:13:52,740 --> 00:13:55,020
Mr. Fu looks very rich.

288
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:56,020
Of course.

289
00:13:56,380 --> 00:13:57,500
That's Jian'an City.

290
00:13:57,780 --> 00:13:58,970
I heard that it's magnificent inside.

291
00:13:58,970 --> 00:13:59,820
It's comparable with the imperial palace.

292
00:13:59,980 --> 00:14:01,260
Even its closestools are made of gold.

293
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,540

294
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,290
Of course.

295
00:14:04,290 --> 00:14:05,050
So rich.

296
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:06,340
Jian'an City is so prosperous.

297
00:14:06,500 --> 00:14:07,780
The Fus used to be the richest family there.

298
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,230
But according to what Fu Hong

299
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:10,670
eats and wears at ordinary times,

300
00:14:11,050 --> 00:14:11,620
he doesn't look like

301
00:14:11,620 --> 00:14:12,860
someone from a rich family.

302
00:14:13,130 --> 00:14:14,430
You don't know about this.

303
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:16,620
Mr. Fu has been raised on Mount Shengyue since childhood.

304
00:14:16,820 --> 00:14:17,790
He hasn't got the stink

305
00:14:17,900 --> 00:14:19,180
of money from Jian'an City at all.

306
00:14:19,620 --> 00:14:20,500
It looks like that

307
00:14:20,700 --> 00:14:22,060
Mr. Fu's gifts

308
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:24,750
are not some ordinary products.

309
00:14:25,130 --> 00:14:26,460
What do you want to do this time?

310
00:14:27,010 --> 00:14:27,710
Let me tell you.

311
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,300
Those gifts must be protected by highly skilled martial artists.

312
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:31,640
I won't do anything.

313
00:14:31,640 --> 00:14:32,820
What kind of person do you think I am?

314
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,300
When you asked me to pretend to be you last time,

315
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,040
my cousin discovered it,

316
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,750
and I almost vomited out of fear.

317
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,430
Don't cause any trouble again.

318
00:14:40,820 --> 00:14:42,060
Don't worry.

319
00:14:43,260 --> 00:14:44,070
The weather is hot.

320
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:45,300
Let's go inside and talk.

321
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:45,900
Okay.

322
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:47,490
-Please. Please. -Please.

324
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:48,540
Let's go.

325
00:14:48,650 --> 00:14:49,060
Okay.

326
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:06,460
Uncle.

327
00:15:06,980 --> 00:15:07,940
I'll go make some tea first.

328
00:15:25,460 --> 00:15:26,900
Uncle Sou, please take a seat.

329
00:15:46,540 --> 00:15:47,700
Uncle Sou, have some tea.

Hong.

331
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:56,700
We've made you suffer these years.

332
00:15:56,980 --> 00:15:57,580
Uncle Sou,

333
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:59,460
what are you talking about?

334
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:01,190
I don't lack

335
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,700
food or drinks here.

336
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:04,220
I'm not suffering.

337
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:06,500
I know you feel wronged.

338
00:16:07,380 --> 00:16:08,110
But

339
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:08,890
you really can't

340
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:10,230
blame your father for being cruel.

341
00:16:10,420 --> 00:16:11,910
He has his own reasons.

342
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:13,340
Uncle Sou,

343
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,100
you don't have to say anything about that.

344
00:16:15,700 --> 00:16:17,100
Let bygones be bygones.

345
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,310
Okay.

346
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,500
It's rare for us to meet today.

347
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:22,780
Let's talk about something else.

348
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:25,790
How has Yao been lately?

349
00:16:27,060 --> 00:16:28,340
Your younger sister

350
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,500
is still the same as she used to be,

351
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:30,830
always bouncing up and down,

352
00:16:31,020 --> 00:16:31,910
and being so naughty.

353
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:33,900
She doesn't behave like a girl.

354
00:16:34,020 --> 00:16:36,100
She even clamors to see you every day.

355
00:16:37,340 --> 00:16:38,390
It's true that my sister and I

356
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,470
haven't seen each other for two years.

357
00:16:44,100 --> 00:16:45,260
It's a long journey this time.

358
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:47,300
It's not convenient for a girl to travel so far.

359
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:48,870
You're right.

360
00:16:50,140 --> 00:16:51,890
You've been on Mount Shengyue for several years.

361
00:16:51,890 --> 00:16:53,900
Luckily, Chong has been with you.

362
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:56,470
Chong is an upright boy.

363
00:16:56,780 --> 00:16:58,100
He's a good kid.

364
00:16:58,300 --> 00:16:58,940
Indeed.

365
00:16:59,130 --> 00:17:00,690
Chong takes care of me

366
00:17:00,690 --> 00:17:01,710
for many things here.

367
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,060
It's great that

368
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:04,300
you have an intimate friend.

369
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:06,310
By the way,

370
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,869
I've heard that Zhuwan is also studying here.

371
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,460
Why didn't I see her today?

372
00:17:12,180 --> 00:17:12,940
As a girl,

373
00:17:13,260 --> 00:17:14,180
she tends to be timid.

374
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:15,859
It looks like that

375
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,030
you and Zhuwan...

376
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:18,060
Zhuwan is a good girl.

377
00:17:19,460 --> 00:17:20,260
In that case,

378
00:17:20,420 --> 00:17:21,780
I'll go to the Murong Family to propose marriage

379
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:23,589
so that you two can get married soon.

380
00:17:23,780 --> 00:17:24,700
Thank you, Uncle Sou.

381
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:34,710
Zhuwan.

382
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,220
Zhuwan.

383
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:38,910
Pastries.

384
00:17:53,180 --> 00:17:53,660
Zhuwan.

385
00:17:54,860 --> 00:17:56,150
What are you drawing?

386
00:17:57,660 --> 00:17:59,580
This is called Treasure Pavilion.

387
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,830
Isn't this Murong Family's old house?

388
00:18:03,740 --> 00:18:04,580
You've been there before?

389
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:07,020
I went there once when I was a kid.

390
00:18:07,220 --> 00:18:07,850
But this house

391
00:18:07,850 --> 00:18:08,660
has been vacant for a long time.

392
00:18:08,900 --> 00:18:09,990
Why are you drawing it?

393
00:18:11,140 --> 00:18:13,350
To look for treasure.

394
00:18:14,980 --> 00:18:15,980
There is treasure there?

395
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,430
Of course not.

396
00:18:18,740 --> 00:18:20,340
Then why are you drawing this?

397
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:21,930
It's adults' business,

398
00:18:21,930 --> 00:18:23,030
and kids shouldn't interfere.

399
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:28,020
Bao,

400
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:29,990
since you've been to this old house before,

401
00:18:30,380 --> 00:18:31,030
do you know

402
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,740
where the library is?

403
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:33,580
I don't know.

404
00:18:43,820 --> 00:18:45,020
Have you gotten rich?

405
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:50,610
Since we are good friends,

406
00:18:50,610 --> 00:18:51,590
I'm giving it to you.

407
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,230
You can't eat this.

408
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:56,900
This is

409
00:18:57,260 --> 00:18:58,820
used for a foot bath.

410
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,340
Use ginseng for a foot bath?

411
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,660
That is really extravagant.

412
00:19:16,060 --> 00:19:16,540
Uncle Sou,

413
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:18,140
if you have anything to tell me,

414
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,260
just say it.

415
00:19:20,820 --> 00:19:21,630
Zhuwan

416
00:19:21,810 --> 00:19:23,820
is Chief Murong's favourite daughter.

417
00:19:24,180 --> 00:19:26,020
After you two get married,

418
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:27,660
the Shanhai Secret Manual...

419
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,190
Uncle Sou.

420
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,550
I love Zhuwan

421
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,060
not because of the manual.

422
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,620
You are my nephew.

423
00:19:35,860 --> 00:19:36,740
I certainly know

424
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:38,030
what you are thinking about.

425
00:19:38,460 --> 00:19:39,730
But the Shanhai Secret Manual

426
00:19:39,730 --> 00:19:40,620
is extraordinary.

427
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:43,340
Everyone in the Martial Arts World wants to own it.

428
00:19:44,580 --> 00:19:46,980
Zhuwan has been naive since childhood.

429
00:19:47,500 --> 00:19:48,570
But the chief

430
00:19:48,570 --> 00:19:50,010
may pass this manual

431
00:19:50,010 --> 00:19:51,910
to his precious daughter.

432
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:53,420
If one day

433
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:55,020
you get the Shanhai Secret Manual,

434
00:19:55,260 --> 00:19:56,580
you must tell me.

435
00:19:57,130 --> 00:19:59,820
I will keep you two safe.

436
00:20:02,620 --> 00:20:04,180
I understand what you're worried about.

437
00:20:06,660 --> 00:20:07,270
Hong.

438
00:20:08,140 --> 00:20:08,620
Hong.

439
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:09,180
Chong.

440
00:20:09,500 --> 00:20:10,100
Why are you here?

441
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:10,830
Uncle Sou.

442
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,620
Chong.

443
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:16,710
Uncle Sou.

444
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,260
These are some specialties of Mount Shengyue.

445
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,380
I specially prepared them for you.

446
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,420
Okay. Take a seat.

447
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:26,390
No wonder I haven't seen Chong lately.

448
00:20:27,170 --> 00:20:28,530
It turns out that he went to

449
00:20:28,530 --> 00:20:30,020
find some local specialities for my uncle.

450
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:31,660
Come on. Have some tea.

451
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,470
Thank you, Uncle Sou.

452
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,450
Jian'an City is far away

453
00:20:35,450 --> 00:20:36,230
from Mount Shengyue.

454
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:37,380
It was not easy for you to come here,

455
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:39,210
so I found all the four seasons' specialties of Mount Shengyue

456
00:20:39,210 --> 00:20:40,540
at one time to give them to you.

457
00:20:41,500 --> 00:20:43,230
And by doing this, I can also let you know

458
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:45,220
what Hong eats during the four seasons

459
00:20:45,380 --> 00:20:46,790
on Mount Shengyue

460
00:20:47,060 --> 00:20:47,930
so that you'll feel relieved.

461
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:49,310
Chong is so thoughtful.

462
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:51,020
I like

463
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:52,740
these specialties very much.

464
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,550
It's good that you like them.

465
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:55,940
It's...

466
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:57,180
here.

467
00:20:58,020 --> 00:20:58,780
This is not right.

468
00:20:58,980 --> 00:21:00,900
This is where Murong Chong takes a bath.

469
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:02,460
How do you know?

470
00:21:07,660 --> 00:21:08,660
That's not the point.

471
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:10,580
Which part is the library?

472
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,460
It's around here.

473
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:13,940
The library of the old house is very small,

474
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:15,380
and there aren't many books there.

475
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:17,370
But my eldest uncle cherishes them very much.

476
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,340
No one is allowed in.

477
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,220
Bao,

478
00:21:27,180 --> 00:21:28,590
come to my room after class.

479
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:30,340
I have something good for you.

480
00:21:37,060 --> 00:21:38,090
You young people

481
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:39,070
have a lot to talk about.

482
00:21:39,740 --> 00:21:40,220
I have something

483
00:21:40,420 --> 00:21:42,140
to discuss with Dean Gao.

484
00:21:42,340 --> 00:21:43,620
I won't chat with you.

485
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:44,620
Later,

486
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,470
I'll visit your Murong Mansion.

487
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,340
Uncle Sou,

488
00:21:47,620 --> 00:21:48,220
let me see you off.

489
00:21:48,700 --> 00:21:49,260
No need.

490
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:49,820
You guys talk.

491
00:21:51,540 --> 00:21:52,220
Take care, Uncle Sou.

492
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:53,020
Okay.

493
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,340
Bao.

494
00:22:02,980 --> 00:22:03,820
Wait for me.

495
00:22:10,460 --> 00:22:11,140
By the way, Zhuwan,

496
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,750
the survival drill will be conducted in a few days.

497
00:22:12,900 --> 00:22:13,750
Are you ready?

498
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,340
It's just a survival drill.

499
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:20,220
Why are you standing there?

500
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:21,220
Come and sit.

501
00:22:25,020 --> 00:22:25,710
I... Well...

502
00:22:26,020 --> 00:22:26,590
I...

503
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,710
Sit anywhere as you like.

504
00:22:29,780 --> 00:22:30,700
Sit on the floor?

505
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,390
Then where else can you sit?

506
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,140
This is my gift for you.

507
00:22:35,330 --> 00:22:36,380
See if you like it.

508
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:38,900
This is

509
00:22:39,530 --> 00:22:40,340
for me?

510
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,420
A longevity lock.

511
00:22:46,180 --> 00:22:46,750
It's mine?

512
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:47,790
Do you like it?

513
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,100
Yes.

514
00:22:49,340 --> 00:22:50,510
I'm going to show it to my master.

515
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:53,780
Xi.

516
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,770
You're back just in time.

517
00:22:55,770 --> 00:22:57,070
I have a gift for you.

518
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:01,930
I see you always wear a pair of

519
00:23:01,930 --> 00:23:03,060
worn-out shoes.

520
00:23:03,220 --> 00:23:04,500
I bought you a new pair of shoes.

521
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:05,330
Try them on later

522
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:05,900
to see if they fit.

523
00:23:06,740 --> 00:23:08,940
You're happy to see me back?

524
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:10,220
Anyway,

525
00:23:10,460 --> 00:23:12,100
we are kind of friends now.

526
00:23:12,980 --> 00:23:13,610
Friends?

527
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:14,420
Am I wrong?

528
00:23:17,500 --> 00:23:18,180
Take them.

529
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:23,710
Why did you...

530
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:25,390
There's no reason.

531
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:27,820
Nothing.

532
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,660
Zhuwan.

533
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,380
Mr. Wei.

534
00:23:34,020 --> 00:23:35,140
What are you doing?

535
00:23:36,490 --> 00:23:38,100
The survival drill will be conducted in a few days.

536
00:23:38,340 --> 00:23:39,950
I don't think you've ever participated in it.

537
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,620
You must not know what to prepare.

538
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,340
So,

539
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,510
when I prepared the tools for it,

540
00:23:43,660 --> 00:23:44,710
I prepared a set of tools for you, too.

541
00:23:47,420 --> 00:23:49,590
I have nothing good here.

542
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:52,660
Well,

543
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:58,660
I'll give this gift to you to show my gratitude.

544
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:00,620
Thank you.

545
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,500
You're welcome.

546
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,980
Take it.

547
00:24:05,740 --> 00:24:06,690
Xi, I have something to do.

548
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:07,290
I have to go.

549
00:24:07,290 --> 00:24:08,180
Help me tidy up

550
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:09,020
the room.

551
00:24:09,580 --> 00:24:10,260
And these, too.

552
00:24:10,420 --> 00:24:11,340
Put them away.

553
00:24:24,020 --> 00:24:24,740
Put them down.

554
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,670
Why are you here?

555
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,180
Why can't I be here?

556
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,180
Mr. Fu.

557
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,210
When I went down the mountain this time,

558
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:01,470
I bought you many gifts.

559
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:02,820
Let me show you.

560
00:25:05,980 --> 00:25:07,110
So frivolous.

561
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,650
These are top-quality

562
00:25:15,650 --> 00:25:16,700
writing brushes, ink sticks, paper and inkstones.

563
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,270
They are all from the Nanshun Store.

564
00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:20,350
They're very expensive.

565
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:21,830
I spent a lot on them.

566
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,070
Besides,

567
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,260
I know you like musical instruments,

568
00:25:34,170 --> 00:25:35,910
so I bought this specially.

569
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:38,100
It's called Jade Flute for Missing You.

570
00:25:40,050 --> 00:25:41,860
It may not be as expensive as the one you use,

571
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,870
but it looks kind of elegant.

572
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,940
And...

573
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:51,700
these books and collections of poems.

574
00:25:51,810 --> 00:25:52,980
They are all for you.

575
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,990
They are all for me?

576
00:25:55,260 --> 00:25:56,420
You can find everything on Mount Shengyue.

577
00:25:56,540 --> 00:25:57,300
Why did you have to do

578
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:58,150
these useless things?

579
00:25:58,300 --> 00:26:00,220
How can you describe this as a useless thing?

580
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:02,720
They're not just gifts.

581
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:03,540
They're the tokens of my regards.

582
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,770
Tokens of your regards?

583
00:26:05,770 --> 00:26:06,180
By the way,

584
00:26:07,020 --> 00:26:08,140
you happen to be here.

585
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:09,450
I also bought you a gift.

586
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:11,140
I don't need to specially send it to you.

587
00:26:13,820 --> 00:26:14,790
Don't blame me for being stingy.

588
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:22,340
[Self-control of Emotions]

589
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:23,790
Take a look.

590
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:24,700
For this jade flute,

591
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,610
I stood in the queue for a long time

592
00:26:25,610 --> 00:26:26,620
before I could buy it.

593
00:26:29,260 --> 00:26:29,690
What kind of

594
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:30,860
book is this?

595
00:26:31,420 --> 00:26:32,430
Who wants this?

596
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,910
[Self-control of Emotions]

597
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:44,060
Hong.

598
00:26:44,420 --> 00:26:45,530
I'll go prepare

599
00:26:45,530 --> 00:26:46,510
for the survival drill.

600
00:26:46,820 --> 00:26:47,420
I'm leaving first.

601
00:26:48,500 --> 00:26:48,850
Okay.

602
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:49,180
I'm giving

603
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:49,980
this to you.

604
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:59,140
You clearly know that Chong gets angry easily.

605
00:26:59,340 --> 00:27:00,500
Why did you still tease him like that?

606
00:27:00,820 --> 00:27:02,230
Because he always bullies me.

607
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,220
Zhuwan.

608
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:06,140
I really like the gifts

609
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:07,980
you gave me.

610
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:10,740
By the way,

611
00:27:11,900 --> 00:27:12,750
my jade pendant...

612
00:27:13,380 --> 00:27:13,740
Right.

613
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,820
I almost forgot if you hadn't mentioned it.

614
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,340
Take a look.

615
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,620
Is this yours?

616
00:27:26,170 --> 00:27:27,620
This is indeed my jade pendant.

617
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,100
Why do you have it?

618
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,230
I knew it.

619
00:27:30,900 --> 00:27:31,450
I saw someone

620
00:27:31,450 --> 00:27:33,020
sell it at the foot of the mountain.

621
00:27:33,540 --> 00:27:34,690
I guessed

622
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:35,610
maybe you lost it

623
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:36,460
accidentally sometime,

624
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,410
so I paid a lot

625
00:27:37,410 --> 00:27:38,660
to buy it back.

626
00:27:39,260 --> 00:27:39,780
What do you think?

627
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,230
Am I smart?

628
00:27:44,340 --> 00:27:44,910
Yes.

629
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,090
Since you like this jade pendant

630
00:27:48,090 --> 00:27:48,910
so much,

631
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,590
I'll give it to you.

632
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,030
Really?

633
00:27:52,500 --> 00:27:53,110
Of course.

634
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,180
This jade pendant

635
00:27:56,500 --> 00:27:57,310
and Chong's jade pendant

636
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,260
were supposed to be a pair.

637
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,690
Since you also have

638
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:00,470
his jade pendant,

639
00:28:01,020 --> 00:28:01,820
I'll give it to you then.

640
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,010
He's so gentle.

641
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,900
Who can resist his charm?

642
00:28:15,460 --> 00:28:16,100
Lord Fu.

643
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,670
Your visit here

644
00:28:17,820 --> 00:28:19,820
is already an honor to our Murong Mansion.

645
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:20,830
We can't

646
00:28:21,100 --> 00:28:22,620
accept this gift.

647
00:28:22,780 --> 00:28:24,740
Mrs. Murong, please don't refuse it.

648
00:28:25,020 --> 00:28:25,820
Since childhood,

649
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:27,450
Hong has been on Mount Shengyue

650
00:28:27,450 --> 00:28:28,940
after he came here from Jian'an City.

651
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,810
Both you

652
00:28:29,810 --> 00:28:31,590
and the chief took good care of him.

653
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:33,170
It's just a small gift,

654
00:28:33,170 --> 00:28:34,140
and it's a token of our regards.

655
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:36,020
Please accept it, Madam.

656
00:28:37,610 --> 00:28:39,580
Please help me thank Governor Fu.

657
00:28:40,740 --> 00:28:41,270
By the way,

658
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:42,540
before I came,

659
00:28:42,820 --> 00:28:44,740
Governor Fu specially told me that

660
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,110
in addition to thanking you and the chief,

661
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,540
he wanted me to ask

662
00:28:48,730 --> 00:28:49,540
about the marriage

663
00:28:49,660 --> 00:28:51,460
between Hong and Lady Murong.

664
00:28:51,620 --> 00:28:52,260
If you two

665
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,730
have no objection,

666
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:54,510
our Jian'an City

667
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,620
will send the betrothal presents and letter.

668
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,020
The engagement between Hong and Zhuwan

669
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,790
was decided in childhood.

670
00:29:02,180 --> 00:29:04,530
Both our families are of equal social ranks.

671
00:29:04,530 --> 00:29:05,660
It's not a trifling matter.

672
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:08,060
But the chief is still in seclusion,

673
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:10,700
and Zhuwan has just recovered.

674
00:29:11,620 --> 00:29:12,260
Lord Fu,

675
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:15,340
please report to the governor that

676
00:29:16,100 --> 00:29:17,550
after the chief comes out,

677
00:29:17,780 --> 00:29:19,770
we'll discuss

678
00:29:19,770 --> 00:29:21,350
about their marriage. Is that okay?

679
00:29:22,660 --> 00:29:24,070
You're right.

680
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:25,590
The marriage of the chief's beloved daughter

681
00:29:25,700 --> 00:29:27,800
should be discussed by the chief personally.

682
00:29:27,800 --> 00:29:29,420
I'll go back and report to the governor that

683
00:29:29,580 --> 00:29:31,100
after the chief comes out,

684
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:32,100
Governor Fu and I

685
00:29:32,260 --> 00:29:33,810
will visit you again.

686
00:29:33,810 --> 00:29:34,340
Okay.

687
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,100
By then, my husband and I

688
00:29:36,300 --> 00:29:38,260
will personally welcome you and Governor Fu.

689
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:41,220
Wei.

690
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:46,250
Lord Fu must be tired

691
00:29:46,250 --> 00:29:47,460
after a long journey.

692
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,340
You should treat him well.

693
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:51,340
If Lord Fu has any request,

694
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,460
you must do your best to fulfill it.

695
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,340
Yes, Mother.

696
00:29:56,300 --> 00:29:57,220
Thank you, Madam.

697
00:29:57,780 --> 00:29:58,460
Lord Fu,

698
00:29:58,930 --> 00:30:00,400
rest for a few days here,

699
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,710
and don't rush back.

700
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,060
The chief is not here.

701
00:30:03,460 --> 00:30:05,220
If we didn't take good care of you,

702
00:30:05,620 --> 00:30:07,100
please forgive us.

703
00:30:07,220 --> 00:30:07,940
Mrs. Murong,

704
00:30:08,140 --> 00:30:09,220
you're too kind.

705
00:30:10,420 --> 00:30:10,950
Please.

706
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,500
Lord Fu.

707
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,220
The banquet must have been ready by now.

708
00:30:15,460 --> 00:30:17,620
Please go to the banquet.

709
00:30:26,940 --> 00:30:27,660
Li Huan.

710
00:30:29,700 --> 00:30:31,820
Keep an eye on Master Wei.

711
00:30:32,330 --> 00:30:33,580
Yes, Madam.

712
00:30:40,420 --> 00:30:40,860
Lord Fu.

713
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,090
Try this year's

714
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,660
newly made Longjing tea picked before Grain Rain.

715
00:30:57,900 --> 00:30:59,100
The tea is fragrant.

716
00:30:59,260 --> 00:31:00,380
It tastes bitter and sweet.

717
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:03,580
I'm so lucky to have the chance to taste it today.

718
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:05,020
I've also prepared

719
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,260
a few jars of Longjing tea for you.

720
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,580
After you go back,

721
00:31:07,700 --> 00:31:08,810
you can enjoy the good tea

722
00:31:08,810 --> 00:31:09,860
with Governor Fu.

723
00:31:10,740 --> 00:31:13,620
Then I'll accept your gift.

724
00:31:18,660 --> 00:31:19,230
Master Wei.

725
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:35,850
Although you and I have never finished walking

726
00:31:35,850 --> 00:31:37,510
all over Mount Shengyue since childhood,

727
00:31:37,660 --> 00:31:38,850
every time when the drill is conducted,

728
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:39,560
it is just around

729
00:31:39,560 --> 00:31:40,740
these several main peaks.

730
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:42,060
The champion

731
00:31:42,290 --> 00:31:43,010
must be

732
00:31:43,010 --> 00:31:44,070
either you or me.

733
00:31:46,180 --> 00:31:46,750
This time,

734
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,340
Zhuwan is going to participate in the survival drill, too.

735
00:31:48,540 --> 00:31:49,530
She barely has any foundation.

736
00:31:49,530 --> 00:31:50,180
I'm afraid she'll lose.

737
00:31:50,180 --> 00:31:51,300
She's almost recovered.

738
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,340
Don't worry about her.

739
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:53,510
She can protect herself.

740
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,060
Although Jian'an City is rich,

741
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,770
its resources are not as abundant as

742
00:31:57,770 --> 00:31:58,660
Mount Shengyue's.

743
00:31:59,530 --> 00:32:01,030
These things will be yours in the future.

744
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,380
If you like them,

745
00:32:02,740 --> 00:32:03,740
I'll give half of them to you

746
00:32:04,460 --> 00:32:06,220
so that you can live carefreely all your life.

747
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:08,060
Chong, you must be joking.

748
00:32:08,370 --> 00:32:09,610
How could I covet

749
00:32:09,610 --> 00:32:10,550
Mount Shengyue?

750
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:13,180
We are like brothers.

751
00:32:13,340 --> 00:32:14,810
We can share everything.

752
00:32:14,810 --> 00:32:15,580
What is mine

753
00:32:16,660 --> 00:32:17,430
is also yours.
