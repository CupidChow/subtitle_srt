I have something to tell you today.

9
00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:44,140
I've found

10
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:45,700
the eldest son of the Murong family,

11
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:46,979
Murong Wei.

12
00:01:49,539 --> 00:01:50,259
Come in.

13
00:01:59,660 --> 00:02:00,100
Wait.

14
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,660
The Murong family has fallen from grace.

15
00:02:02,980 --> 00:02:04,210
I thought Murong Wei was dead too.

16
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:06,980
Maybe he practiced demonic arts too.

17
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:08,220
We can't trust him.

19
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,620
what do you plan to do

20
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,380
to this vestige of the Murong family?

21
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,060
Governor,

22
00:02:18,380 --> 00:02:20,860
Murong Wei has suffered injustice.

23
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:22,740
He came to me

24
00:02:22,900 --> 00:02:23,900
in the hope that the Fu family

25
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:25,180
could clear his name.

I'm here today

00:02:38,540 --> 00:02:40,500
to prove my innocence.

30
00:02:40,900 --> 00:02:42,450
Murong Chong is a demon.

31
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:43,700
I see him as an implacable enemy

32
00:02:44,180 --> 00:02:45,340
and have nothing to do with him.

33
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,140
You mean

34
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:50,300
you have nothing to do

35
00:02:50,450 --> 00:02:51,460
with the Murong family?

36
00:02:53,610 --> 00:02:54,579
To tell you the truth,

37
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:56,500
after I found that Murong Chong

38
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,980
practiced demonic arts and absorbed others' inner force,

39
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:00,060
I went to him

40
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,420
to persuade him to turn to the right path

41
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:03,270
and apologize

42
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:05,060
to the Martial Arts World.

43
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:07,580
But I was not skilled in martial arts enough

44
00:03:07,780 --> 00:03:09,020
and was badly injured by him.

45
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:10,860
I had no choice but to escape.

46
00:03:11,540 --> 00:03:12,100
Governor.

47
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:13,660
Murong Wei was seriously injured

48
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,050
when he came to me.

49
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,940
I can testify for him.

50
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,450
Then why is he here now?

51
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,540
Now that Murong Chong

52
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,340
has been arrested

53
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,780
and peace has been restored,

54
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:25,500
I came here to explain things

55
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,100
and clear my name.

56
00:03:27,420 --> 00:03:28,579
I want to revitalize the Murong family.

57
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,060
To achieve that,

58
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:31,820
I'm willing to interrogate Murong Chong

59
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:33,730
as his brother.

60
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:36,020
After he hands over the Manual,

61
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,700
I'll make it public

62
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,579
so everyone can benefit from it.

63
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,820
Fine.

64
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:43,410
The Fu family is kind-hearted.

65
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,890
I'll trust you this time.

66
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,300

67
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,820
You'll be in full charge of this matter.

68
00:03:50,380 --> 00:03:51,700
Yes, Governor.

69
00:03:54,020 --> 00:03:55,060
Since Murong Chong

70
00:03:55,060 --> 00:03:55,900
is in our hands now,

71
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:57,500
we should finish him off right away.

73
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:00,420
Don't you think

74
00:04:01,460 --> 00:04:03,460
a clean death is too easy for him?

75
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:04,260
Mr. Fu,

76
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:05,380
are you really interested

77
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,300
in the Shanhai Secret Manual?

78
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,980
If so,

79
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:09,820
I can teach you martial arts.

80
00:04:11,780 --> 00:04:13,420
You got me wrong.

81
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,570
The Shanhai Secret Manual

82
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:17,660
is too hard for ordinary people.

83
00:04:18,019 --> 00:04:19,620
I wouldn't even dream of practicing it.

84
00:04:21,579 --> 00:04:24,170
I want Murong Chong to surrender the Manual

85
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:26,900
because of other reasons.

86
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:29,020
What are they?

87
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,330
First,

88
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:33,460
if we get the Manual,

89
00:04:33,659 --> 00:04:35,780
you can continue your cultivation,

90
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:37,500
which will make us

91
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:39,530
an even more powerful team.

92
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:41,940

94

we subjected Murong Chong to the most severe torture,

95
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:47,540
but he still wouldn't reveal

96
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:48,300
where the Manual is.

97
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:50,700
I'll go grill him.

98
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,060
Wait, Master Wei.

99
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:59,659

104
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:18,380
I just went out for a walk.

these days?

112
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:46,140
Do you know

113
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:47,180

116
00:05:56,780 --> 00:05:57,940
I already know

117
00:05:58,260 --> 00:05:59,060
what he did to you.

118
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:01,740
That's why I want you

119
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:02,780
to stay in your room.

120
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:03,980
Don't go anywhere.

121
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:05,050
I'll send more guards

123

But…

124
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,460
But you've taken Chong captive.

125
00:06:12,980 --> 00:06:14,290
You grew up with him.

126
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,900
You know him the best.

127
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:20,220
Can you let him go?

128
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,140
You're too young

129
00:06:21,450 --> 00:06:22,380
to understand what's going on.

130
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:24,300
Don't mention it again.

from Murong Chong.

164
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:22,900
Pass it around.

00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,100
Is this

167

really the Shanhai Secret Manual?

00:08:49,780 --> 00:08:51,380
since we have found

the Shanhai Secret Manual,

172
00:08:53,460 --> 00:08:55,140
can we execute

173

179
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:07,340
Then I'll kill him.

That's the kind of pain he deserves.

197
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:49,460
Please come in.

198
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:50,580
Thank you.

199
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:51,460
Please come in.

200
00:09:51,610 --> 00:09:53,140
Thank you.

201
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,260
Please come in.

202
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:55,140
Help yourself.

203
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,100
Thank you.

204
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,060
Thank you all

205
00:09:57,060 --> 00:09:57,340
Thank you.

206
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,660
for coming to

207
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:00,060
Governor Fu's wedding.

208
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:02,460
Thank you for coming.

209
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:04,100
Thank you.

210
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,820
Congratulations.

211
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:06,860
Thank you.

212
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,210
Thank you.

213
00:10:08,580 --> 00:10:09,820
Please come in.

214
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,770
Come on.

215
00:10:17,410 --> 00:10:22,450
[Gathering Auspiciousness]

216
00:10:21,850 --> 00:10:22,540
The Governor has given his order.

217
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:23,860
No one is allowed to visit Miss Zhuwan

218
00:10:24,020 --> 00:10:25,060
before the wedding.

219
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,340
Please go back, Miss Yao.

220
00:10:26,540 --> 00:10:27,980
Don't use the Governor against me.

221
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:29,900
Get out of my way,

222
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,100
or it'll end badly for you.

223
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:31,820
Miss Yao.

224
00:10:31,980 --> 00:10:32,420
Move way.

225
00:10:32,780 --> 00:10:33,980
I need to talk to my sister-in-law.

226
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:34,980
Yes.

227
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,240
[Gathering Auspiciousness]

228
00:10:40,220 --> 00:10:40,770
Yao.

229
00:10:41,020 --> 00:10:41,540
Zhuwan.

230
00:10:41,820 --> 00:10:42,780
Yao.

231
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,380
Yao, you came.

232
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,660
Zhuwan.

233
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,700
You look great in red.

234
00:10:51,860 --> 00:10:53,340
When my brother sees you so beautiful,

235
00:10:53,500 --> 00:10:54,010
he'll be very happy

236
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:55,380
and grin ear to ear.

237
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,940
Yao.

238
00:10:57,140 --> 00:10:57,780
I'm going to

239
00:10:57,940 --> 00:10:59,490
marry your brother.

240
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:00,700
I'll let go of

241
00:11:00,860 --> 00:11:02,180
all the feelings I shouldn't be having.

242
00:11:02,340 --> 00:11:04,020
I only ask you for one thing.

243
00:11:04,730 --> 00:11:06,380
Save Murong Chong, please.

244
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,340
Zhuwan.

245
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,210
I'm willing to do anything for you in return.

246
00:11:11,780 --> 00:11:12,540
Yao.

247
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,340
Please.

248
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:17,660
Zhuwan.

249
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,260
It's true that I've always

250
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,980
admired Murong Chong.

251
00:11:21,970 --> 00:11:23,620
But at this point,

252
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:24,580
I can't let him go

253
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,660
just because I want to.

254
00:11:26,810 --> 00:11:29,180
Yao, I'm begging you.

255
00:11:30,020 --> 00:11:31,700
As long as you can save Murong Chong,

256
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:34,540
I'll do anything for you.

257
00:11:35,020 --> 00:11:36,020
I'm sorry.

258
00:11:36,340 --> 00:11:37,940
I really can't do it.

259
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:40,300
I can't betray my brother.

260
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,340
Please.

261
00:11:44,340 --> 00:11:45,930
Please save Murong Chong.

262
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:53,490
Please, Yao.

263
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,540
Zhuwan.

264
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:12,940
Murong Chong.

265
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,780
I brought you the wedding wine.

266
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:20,700
Don't be so cold.

267
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:23,700
Today is the wedding day

268
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:25,700
of Governor Fu and Miss Zhuwan.

269
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:27,820
Get lost.

270
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,140
Governor Fu asked me

271
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,540
to bring you this wine.

272
00:12:34,820 --> 00:12:37,660
I'm afraid you can't refuse it.

273
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:41,940
There's sufficient poison in it,

274
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:44,820
so you won't suffer for long.

275
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,140
Young Master, I'm late.

276
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,740
Glad you know that.

277
00:12:58,740 --> 00:12:59,300
Young Master.

278
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:02,580
Untie me!

279
00:13:06,740 --> 00:13:07,930
What a great wedding!

280
00:13:08,410 --> 00:13:09,640
She's coming.

281
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:32,780
What a perfect match!

282
00:13:34,370 --> 00:13:35,260
Governor!

283
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,260
Bad news, Governor.

284
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,180
Someone broke into the prison.

285
00:13:39,340 --> 00:13:40,140
Murong Chong ran away.

286
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,120
Who broke Murong Chong out?

287
00:13:42,140 --> 00:13:43,230
A man.

288
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:44,300
He killed Mr. Xu.

289
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,220
He's very powerful.

290
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,220
Protect Zhuwan.

291
00:13:48,220 --> 00:13:48,780
Go to the dungeon.

292
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:49,620
Yes.

293
00:13:58,700 --> 00:13:59,300
Zhuwan!

294
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:03,900
Miss.

295
00:14:04,820 --> 00:14:05,890
Miss.

296
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:07,740
Yao?

297
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:11,340
Yao, wake up.

298
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,300
Brother.

299
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,740
I'm fine.

300
00:14:16,060 --> 00:14:17,300
Don't worry.

301
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:22,780
Don't blame Zhuwan.

302
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:25,180
She…

303
00:14:26,260 --> 00:14:26,890
Yao!

304
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,300
Yao, wake up!

305
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,340
Yao!

306
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:31,820
Yao!

307
00:14:33,660 --> 00:14:34,980
Su Yueying.

308
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,100
If anything happens to Yao,

309
00:14:38,460 --> 00:14:40,460
I'll destroy the whole Su family!

310
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:46,140
Miss. Miss.

311
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:47,700
Zhuwan.

312
00:14:47,700 --> 00:14:48,420
I've told Xi Feng

313
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,260
to save Chong.

314
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:51,020
Go meet them in the back alley now.

315
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,370
We'll see a path leading out of the city

316
00:14:53,620 --> 00:14:55,140
after we leave this ally.

317
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,820
Go!

318
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:02,420
Brother, do you mean to stop me?

319
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,300
I need to protect Master Chong.

320
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,540
Then we have to fight!

321
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,740
Murong Chong!

322
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:43,700
Xi You, stop it.

323
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:07,660
Xi You!

324
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:09,220
She…

325
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:16,860
No.

326
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:17,740
No.

327
00:16:18,620 --> 00:16:19,600
No.

328
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,940
No, Xi You.

329
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:24,980
Xi You.

330
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,260
Xi You!

331
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,100
Brother.

332
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,820
Stay alive.

333
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:45,580
Live well.

334
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:00,730
Xi You!

335
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,780
Xi You, I didn't mean to kill you.

336
00:17:03,140 --> 00:17:05,980
It wasn't me! It wasn't me.

337
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,540
Xi You!

338
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:14,940
Xi You!

339
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,380
Yao.

340
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:37,980
I'm sorry.

341
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,580
Have you found the physician?

342
00:17:42,770 --> 00:17:44,020
I've sent out more people

343
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,420
to invite famous physicians.

344
00:17:46,100 --> 00:17:47,580
We must find the best physician

345
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,060
to heal Yao's wound.

346
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:09,060
Miss Su, you can't go out.

347
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,860
How dare you get in my way?

348
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:14,900
The Governor said

349
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,260
that no one from the Su family

350
00:18:16,460 --> 00:18:17,660
is not allowed to move about freely

351
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:18,540
in Jian'an City.

352
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:20,620
Am I under house arrest?

353
00:18:21,980 --> 00:18:23,180
Miss Su,

354
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,740
please don't make things difficult for us.

355
00:18:43,860 --> 00:18:44,460
Master Chong.

356
00:18:49,460 --> 00:18:52,300
I'm sorry about Xi You.

357
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,740
It's my fault.

358
00:18:56,330 --> 00:18:58,220
I didn't care enough about you two.

359
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,140
After this matter is over,

360
00:19:02,460 --> 00:19:03,620
I'll pay my respects at her grave.

361
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:06,900
Sorry.

362
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:23,940
Don't be too sad.

363
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:28,940
All right.

364
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:30,820
Say no more.

365
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:36,740
Luckily, Fu Yao told me

366
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,060
about this secret house beforehand.

367
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,740
We'll stay here for the time being.

368
00:19:41,740 --> 00:19:42,700
I hope this is

369
00:19:42,860 --> 00:19:43,940
a safe place.

370
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:49,060
Murong Chong

371
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,740
escaped on my wedding day.

372
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,220
Su Yueying stabbed Yao in the chaos.

373
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:55,420
These things shouldn't have happened.

374
00:19:55,660 --> 00:19:56,580
Can anyone tell me

375
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,860
what has gone wrong?

376
00:20:01,690 --> 00:20:02,780
Governor.

377
00:20:03,370 --> 00:20:07,180
I should be responsible

378
00:20:07,230 --> 00:20:08,530
for what happened today.

379
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,620
Deputy Governor.

380
00:20:10,020 --> 00:20:11,700
The Governor's Token is in your hands.

381
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:13,300
All the troops in Jian'an City

382
00:20:13,320 --> 00:20:14,420
are at your command.

383
00:20:14,700 --> 00:20:16,860
How could you let this happen?

384
00:20:17,060 --> 00:20:18,490
Murong Chong escaped.

385
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:19,900
Yao's life is hanging by a thread.

386
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,420
How are you going to take the responsibility?

387
00:20:22,260 --> 00:20:23,500
Well, I…

388
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:25,900
We'll discuss

389
00:20:26,050 --> 00:20:27,420
Murong Chong's escape later.

390
00:20:27,730 --> 00:20:28,380
But Yao

391
00:20:28,500 --> 00:20:29,540
is your niece.

392
00:20:29,620 --> 00:20:30,460
Why didn't you

393
00:20:30,580 --> 00:20:31,780
come out to stop Su Yueying

394
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,460
when she tried to kill her?

395
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:34,980
Do you deserve

396
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,300
to be the Deputy Governor of Jian'an City?

397
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,900
Do you deserve to be Yao's uncle?

398
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:39,660
Governor.

399
00:20:40,060 --> 00:20:40,700
You…

400
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:42,820
You can't be so harsh on me.

401
00:20:43,260 --> 00:20:45,340
I would save Yao if I could.

402
00:20:45,740 --> 00:20:46,340
At that time,

403
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:49,060
it all happened too fast.

404
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:50,780
I was stunned.

405
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:53,540
Besides, we all thought

406
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,260
that the bride was Zhuwan.

407
00:20:55,660 --> 00:20:56,140
Are you saying

408
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:57,620
that Zhuwan didn't deserve to be saved?

409
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,500
Just admit it, Uncle Sou.

410
00:20:59,690 --> 00:21:00,780
Your old age

411
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,900
has made you slow.

412
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:04,900
You have the Governor's Token

413
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:05,620
but failed to keep

414
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:06,980
Jian'an City safe

415
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:09,260
and your family safe.

416
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,020
What…

417
00:21:10,810 --> 00:21:13,380
What are you getting at?

418
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,020
I think

419
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,450
you should give the Governor's Token to me.

420
00:21:15,860 --> 00:21:17,100
I'll deploy the troops

421
00:21:17,330 --> 00:21:18,500
to capture Murong Chong

422
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,620
and protect the people of Jian'an City.

423
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:21,220
You…

424
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:25,180
Please hand over the Governor's Token.

425
00:21:50,130 --> 00:21:51,650
[Fu] [Book of Medicine]

426
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:58,620
Young Master, something happened.

427
00:21:59,620 --> 00:22:00,300
What happened?

428
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:01,580
Miss Fu Yao got injured.

429
00:22:01,900 --> 00:22:03,140
How? Who did it?

430
00:22:03,460 --> 00:22:04,700
Su Yueying stabbed her.

431
00:22:05,660 --> 00:22:06,820
Is it serious? How is she now?

432
00:22:07,420 --> 00:22:07,820
Yes.

433
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:08,900
Her life is in danger.

434
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:10,740
Fu Yao got hurt

435
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,500
because of us.

436
00:22:12,780 --> 00:22:14,380
I have to do something.

437
00:22:15,330 --> 00:22:16,020
By the way,

438
00:22:16,260 --> 00:22:17,660
don't tell Zhuwan about it.

439
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:18,860
If she knows,

440
00:22:19,180 --> 00:22:20,900
she'll go settle the score with Su Yueying.

441
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:22,900
It's too late.

442
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,250
Zhuwan.

443
00:22:27,940 --> 00:22:28,540
Zhuwan.

444
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:29,540
Don't worry.

445
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,940
I know the priorities.

446
00:22:31,090 --> 00:22:32,820
I won't go to Su Yueying now.

447
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:34,340
Also,

448
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:36,260
Yao got hurt because of me.

449
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,540
I can't stand by and do nothing.

450
00:22:38,100 --> 00:22:38,940
My master left me a great medicine

451
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:39,860
in Mount Jiuju.

452
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,770
I'll go fetch it.

453
00:22:40,770 --> 00:22:41,340
No.

454
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:42,900
The whole world

455
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,660
is looking for us now.

456
00:22:43,660 --> 00:22:44,770
It's too dangerous for you to go out.

457
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,020
It's okay.

458
00:22:49,300 --> 00:22:50,380
I'll go with you.

459
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,540
If you go with me,

460
00:22:51,580 --> 00:22:53,220
we'll get discovered more easily.

461
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,020
Enough. Don't worry.

462
00:22:58,500 --> 00:22:59,810
Hurry back.

463
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:00,620
Okay.

464
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:05,140
Take a look.

465
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:06,410
It's very fresh.

466
00:23:07,060 --> 00:23:07,860
Have a look.

467
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:14,300
Take a look.

468
00:23:15,450 --> 00:23:15,940
It's quite fresh.

469
00:23:17,620 --> 00:23:18,540
Have some.

470
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:19,540
Ting Xuan.

471
00:23:20,020 --> 00:23:20,780
I want to spend more time here.

472
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:22,020
You go back now.

473
00:23:22,340 --> 00:23:23,060
Yes.

474
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:03,570
Chong,

475
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:04,940
the city is brimming

476
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:05,890
with people looking for you.

477
00:24:06,380 --> 00:24:07,660
You shouldn't be here.

478
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,340
When Meng Tang

479
00:24:08,500 --> 00:24:09,580
sent Yao to me,

480
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:10,580
I knew

481
00:24:10,930 --> 00:24:12,100
that you were about to do something.

482
00:24:13,060 --> 00:24:14,860
Are you sure you want to take the risk?

483
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,060
At this point,

484
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,460
it's too late

485
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:19,620
to go back.

486
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:22,300
It's a risky plan, but we stand a chance of winning.

487
00:24:22,860 --> 00:24:24,100
Don't worry about me.

488
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:26,340
Okay.

489
00:24:26,740 --> 00:24:28,100
Now that you've made your decision,

490
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:29,820
we'll stand strong together

491
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:31,820
no matter what the future brings.

492
00:24:33,980 --> 00:24:35,020
How are things on your end?

493
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,540
Everything is ready.

494
00:24:37,410 --> 00:24:39,060
Let's see how far we can go.

495
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,820
Deputy Governor.

496
00:24:46,740 --> 00:24:47,580
Has Fu Hong

497
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,620
done anything unusual recently?

498
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:50,820
I noticed

499
00:24:51,180 --> 00:24:52,980
that Fu Hong's inner force is extremely strong.

500
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:55,690
Nothing else besides that.

501
00:24:56,060 --> 00:24:57,180
Keep an eye on him.

502
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,700
Find out

503
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,140
what kind of martial arts he practices.

504
00:25:01,140 --> 00:25:01,820
Yes.

505
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:03,540
He doesn't suspect you, does he?

506
00:25:04,290 --> 00:25:05,180
No.

507
00:25:05,420 --> 00:25:06,900
After Meng Tang died,

508
00:25:07,180 --> 00:25:08,620
he trusts me very much.

509
00:25:10,660 --> 00:25:12,180
Good.

510
00:25:14,180 --> 00:25:16,580
Fu Hong is paranoid.

511
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:19,980
Only you

512
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,500
can get close to him now.

513
00:25:22,170 --> 00:25:23,660
You must not get exposed.

514
00:25:23,940 --> 00:25:24,940
Yes.

515
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,900
Young Master.

516
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,100
I asked you to contact

517
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,180
the former subordinates of the Murong family.

518
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,290
How did it go?

519
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:34,460
It went smoothly.

520
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,380
How many of them are still loyal?

521
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:38,180
Less than half.

522
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:42,220
Keep in touch with them.

523
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:44,340
I'll meet them in a few days.

524
00:25:44,780 --> 00:25:45,340
Yes.

525
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:46,740
Go.

526
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:47,700
Yes.

527
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,420
Wait.

528
00:25:51,020 --> 00:25:51,820
Has Zhuwan

529
00:25:52,420 --> 00:25:53,580
come back?

530
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:55,100
No.

531
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:09,690
[Beautiful House]

532
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:20,620
I've never seen my master

533
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,260
open this wooden box before.

534
00:26:22,540 --> 00:26:23,700
It can't be opened by force.

535
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,220
What's in it?

536
00:26:40,330 --> 00:26:42,260
I found it. Fu Yao can be saved.

537
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:45,740
Look at that.

538
00:26:46,540 --> 00:26:47,780
When I was cleaning the room,

539
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:50,100
I found that one corner of this painting curled up.

540
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,860
It seems to have been tampered with.

541
00:27:02,980 --> 00:27:05,180
Mountain and sea.

542
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,780
The mountains are green, the sea is blue.

543
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:11,980
I praise mountains and the sea while I'm traveling around the world.

544
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:17,130
I know what that children's song means.

545
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:20,580
That old fox Fu Wenhuai

546
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:22,700
has long told Fu Hong

547
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:27,620
where the Manual was hidden.

548
00:27:37,490 --> 00:27:39,180
If you hadn't come to me in person,

549
00:27:40,060 --> 00:27:40,900
I'd still be trapped

550
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:42,260
in that inn.

551
00:27:42,770 --> 00:27:43,940
They kept me like a prisoner.

552
00:27:44,190 --> 00:27:47,180
Fu Hong has no heart at all.

553
00:27:48,820 --> 00:27:49,940
Miss Su,

554
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,460
calm down.

555
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,250
Have some dessert.

556
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,380
How can I calm down?

557
00:27:56,260 --> 00:27:56,900
He humiliated

558
00:27:57,020 --> 00:27:58,460
the whole Su family!

559
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,580
The cooperation you mentioned earlier,

560
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:08,100
is it still on the table?

561
00:28:09,540 --> 00:28:11,140
You've changed your mind?

562
00:28:12,530 --> 00:28:13,500
Everyone,

563
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:16,580
I summoned you here today

564
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:19,140
because I need to tell you something.

565
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:21,380
What's bothering you so much?

566
00:28:23,780 --> 00:28:24,780
To be honest,

567
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:28,700
there are two copies of the Shanhai Secret Manual.

568
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:31,090
The Fu family has one.

569
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,860
The Murong family has the other.

570
00:28:34,060 --> 00:28:35,380
The Fu family's copy

571
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:37,580
has been taken by Fu Hong.

572
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,980
Then has he mastered the Divine Art of Shanhai?

573
00:28:45,500 --> 00:28:46,740
The Shanhai Secret Manual

574
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,860
is too hard to be understood by most people.

575
00:28:49,460 --> 00:28:51,420
Fu Hong has shown signs of insanity.

576
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:53,780
I called you guys here

577
00:28:54,060 --> 00:28:56,060
to discuss solutions.

578
00:28:56,940 --> 00:28:58,620
What should we do?

579
00:28:59,380 --> 00:29:00,260
That sounds serious.

580
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,700
Those families that were wiped out…

581
00:29:04,820 --> 00:29:06,620
He must have played a part in it.

582
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:08,180
I suspect

583
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,220
that Fu Hong has colluded

584
00:29:10,380 --> 00:29:11,820
with Murong Chong.

585
00:29:16,060 --> 00:29:17,300
The problem is

586
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:19,780
what we should do next.

587
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,300
Yeah.

588
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,780
Now that the two demons joined hands,

589
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:24,050
what can we do to stop them?

590
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:25,530
We're in trouble now.

591
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,300
They're hard to deal with.

592
00:29:26,460 --> 00:29:26,940
Yes.

593
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:31,820
If you guys can help me

594
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:34,340
become the Governor of Jian'an City,

595
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,140
I'll make the best use

596
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:38,300
of all the available resources

597
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,220
to bring them to justice.

598
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,580
By then,

599
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:43,100
I promise

600
00:29:43,340 --> 00:29:44,780
to share the Shanhai Secret Manual

601
00:29:45,020 --> 00:29:46,380
with everyone

602
00:29:46,660 --> 00:29:48,100
at present.

603
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:49,900
In that case,

604
00:29:50,420 --> 00:29:51,740
I'll do everything I can

605
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:53,540
to help you become the Governor.

606
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:55,500
Lord Fu is highly respected.

607
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,500
He deserves that position.

608
00:29:56,700 --> 00:29:57,250
Exactly.

609
00:29:57,460 --> 00:29:58,900
Fu Hong is a monster.

610
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,460
I support Lord Fu too.

611
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:02,860
Fu Hong practiced the Divine Art of Shanhai.

612
00:30:03,060 --> 00:30:05,620
He's almost invincible now.

613
00:30:06,380 --> 00:30:07,300
We need to find

614
00:30:07,500 --> 00:30:08,810
his weakness

615
00:30:09,780 --> 00:30:11,940
to tear him down.

616
00:30:13,740 --> 00:30:14,460
I know

617
00:30:14,780 --> 00:30:16,380
that Fu Hong values his sister very much.

618
00:30:16,810 --> 00:30:18,540
If we take Fu Yao as hostage,

619
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:20,500
we'll be able to get to Fu Hong.

620
00:30:21,340 --> 00:30:22,380
Good idea.

621
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,620
It's indeed a good idea.

622
00:30:24,140 --> 00:30:27,140
Yao is my niece.

623
00:30:28,980 --> 00:30:30,300
But I believe

624
00:30:32,940 --> 00:30:33,740
she'll understand

625
00:30:34,300 --> 00:30:36,580
why we have to do that.

626
00:30:50,220 --> 00:30:50,980
Governor.

627
00:30:51,540 --> 00:30:52,580
What are you doing here?

628
00:30:52,900 --> 00:30:53,740
Uncle Sou.

629
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:56,340
I should ask you that.

630
00:30:56,730 --> 00:30:57,980
You broke in with so many people.

631
00:30:58,180 --> 00:30:59,460
What happened?

632
00:31:02,140 --> 00:31:04,060
Jian'an City is not safe recently.

633
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:06,180
I brought them to protect Yao.

634
00:31:06,410 --> 00:31:07,580
You're considerate, Uncle Sou.

635
00:31:08,180 --> 00:31:09,500
Yao is not here.

636
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,060
I've sent a great physician

637
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,380
to treat her.

638
00:31:13,860 --> 00:31:14,900
That's great.

639
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:16,220
I'm relieved.

640
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,500
You and the Su family

641
00:31:17,700 --> 00:31:18,700
have gotten quite close recently.

642
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:21,780
You'd better keep a distance

643
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,860
from them.

644
00:31:33,020 --> 00:31:33,700
Young Master.

645
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:35,940
I found that Fu Sou, Su Yueying,

646
00:31:36,180 --> 00:31:38,100
and other family leaders had a secret meeting.

647
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:42,020
Fu Sou must be cooking up something.

648
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:43,540
Take Yao away

649
00:31:43,980 --> 00:31:45,220
in case anything happens.

650
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,300
If anyone discovers

651
00:31:48,650 --> 00:31:49,420
that I didn't die,

652
00:31:49,780 --> 00:31:50,620
your plan with Master Chong

653
00:31:50,620 --> 00:31:51,260
will be…

654
00:31:51,260 --> 00:31:52,140
Don't worry about that.

655
00:31:53,020 --> 00:31:54,180
No matter what happens,

656
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,460
I won't put Yao in danger again.

657
00:31:56,780 --> 00:31:57,740
You must keep her safe.

658
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,660
But it unsettles me

659
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,580
that I can't stay with you to protect you

660
00:32:02,090 --> 00:32:02,940
when the storm comes.

661
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,540
Don't worry about me.

662
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,140
It must be very inconvenient

663
00:32:06,340 --> 00:32:07,820
that you have to stay hidden recently.

664
00:32:08,610 --> 00:32:09,540
I'm sorry for that.
