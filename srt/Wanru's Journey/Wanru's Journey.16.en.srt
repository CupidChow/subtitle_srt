00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,500
Yes, they really did a good job.

00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:41,460
They're both experts.

be lucky like he was yesterday?

9
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:46,390
I'm not sure.

10
00:01:47,020 --> 00:01:47,870
But today,

11
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,500
it won't be that easy.

12
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:51,979
Murong Chong defeated Lu Yuyong yesterday.

13
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:53,700
Although it seemed easy,

14
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:55,450
he must have some internal injuries.

15
00:01:55,450 --> 00:01:57,920
He's just holding up now.

16
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,500
I'm sure he will...

17
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:31,590
He's dying.

00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,900
He's jack-of-all-trades.

20
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:22,910
Master Chong.

21
00:03:23,260 --> 00:03:24,550
I'm He Yichan.

22
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,060
I'm here to learn from you.

23
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,780
You'd better be careful.

This is...

26
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:10,190
What a strange move!

27
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,220
Impossible.

28
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,650
How could Murong Chong

29
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,940
beat He Yichan?

30
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:31,390
No way.

31
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,740
What kind of trick is this?

32
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,220
Master Chong, you kills are not that good.

33
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,370
Chong is really good at kung fu.

34
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:19,180
He's penny wise and pound foolish.

35
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:46,830
I knew it.

36
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:48,020
He should have given up earlier and gone home.

37
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:49,020
But he insisted on fighting.

38
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,450
I didn't expect that

39
00:05:53,450 --> 00:05:54,940
his martial arts has reached such a high level.

40
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:58,060
Did he practice the Shanhai Secret Manual?

41
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,420
But since my brother became the Chief,

42
00:06:01,700 --> 00:06:03,740
-I've never heard of that Murong family -You...

43
00:06:04,010 --> 00:06:05,620

If you think you can, come forward and fight with me.

46
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:16,100

00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:52,530
Master Murong Chong showed his power

140
00:09:52,530 --> 00:09:53,530
and defeated

141
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:54,260
all challengers.

142
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,360

should have been his.

I didn't expect that.

Yes, I'm pretty sure!

As for such a demon,

00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:01,710
to defeat him.

195
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:03,190
Do you have any evidence?

196
00:12:03,940 --> 00:12:05,660
I saw it with my own eyes that day.

197
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,530
The martial arts that killed all members of our Xie family

198
00:12:07,530 --> 00:12:08,380
was the same one

199
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,190
as Murong Chong's.

200
00:12:10,460 --> 00:12:10,940
How do you know

201
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:12,140
it's the Manual?

202
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:14,110
As we all know,

203
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,730
the Shanhai Secret Manual

204
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:17,140
has been hidden in Murong family.

205
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,370
Besides, the kung fu the murderer used to kill my whole family that day

206
00:12:19,370 --> 00:12:20,670
was extremely fierce and weird.

207
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:22,460
We can't find anything in the ancient books.

208
00:12:22,780 --> 00:12:23,940
What else can it be

209
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:25,070
except Shanhai Secret Manual?

210
00:12:25,900 --> 00:12:27,190
You have a point.

211
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:29,570
But if we

212
00:12:29,570 --> 00:12:30,980
act rashly,

213
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:33,310
will it bring the disaster of death to us?

214
00:12:33,500 --> 00:12:34,580
I just want to live a peaceful life

215
00:12:34,690 --> 00:12:35,500
with my wife.

216
00:12:35,660 --> 00:12:37,420
You are always mentioning your wife.

217
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,860
If we don't take actions,

218
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:39,930
other sects in the martial arts world

219
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,030
will suffer from him too.

220
00:12:41,180 --> 00:12:41,730
In my opinion,

221
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:42,930
we'd better post a Hero Post

222
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,140
and fight with him directly.

223
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,860
I'm sure

224
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:50,050
Murong Chong definitely practiced

225
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:51,150
the Shanhai Secret Manual.

226
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:53,830
I'm not afraid of confronting him.

227
00:12:55,380 --> 00:12:55,980
Everyone,

228
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,540
please calm down.

229
00:12:58,420 --> 00:12:59,060
Now,

230
00:12:59,540 --> 00:13:01,030
we don't have enough evidence.

231
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:04,100
We need further consideration.

232
00:14:09,250 --> 00:14:09,780
Chong.

233
00:14:11,770 --> 00:14:12,380
Chong.

234
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:14,180
Chong.

235
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:15,390
Chong, what's wrong?

236
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:16,030
Chong.

237
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:23,990
Chong.

238
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:27,740
Chong.

239
00:14:28,140 --> 00:14:28,940
Chong, wake up!

240
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,820
Wake up!

241
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:31,100
Chong.

242
00:14:31,780 --> 00:14:32,860
What happened?

243
00:14:33,210 --> 00:14:33,780
Senior.

244
00:14:34,050 --> 00:14:35,150
What happened to him?

245
00:14:35,260 --> 00:14:35,660
Well...

246
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,420
I don't know either.

247
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:42,780
-Chong. -Mother!

248
00:14:44,660 --> 00:14:45,700
Mr. Yunhe.

249
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,500
Why are you here?

250
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,100
We came to see you.

251
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:50,470
You suddenly went crazy.

252
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,460
What happened, Chong?

253
00:14:57,420 --> 00:14:58,980
I've practiced the Shanhai Secret Manual.

254
00:15:03,220 --> 00:15:04,620
The Shanhai Secret Manual

255
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:06,870
is in your hands?

256
00:15:07,340 --> 00:15:07,660
Well...

257
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:12,660
It seems that...

258
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:15,620
what your father said

259
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:17,430
is true.

260
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:18,910
What did my father say?

261
00:15:20,660 --> 00:15:22,060
He said no one

262
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,510
could practice the Shanhai Secret Manual.

263
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:27,340
Or they'll lose their mind,

264
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:32,340
or even die of broken tendons and veins.

265
00:15:35,580 --> 00:15:36,260
Senior,

266
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,740
please help Chong.

267
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:41,660
I can't guarantee.

268
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,500
But I will do my best.

269
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:45,550
Master Chong.

270
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:46,660
Don't practice the Shanhai Secret Manual

271
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:48,820
for the time being.

272
00:15:50,380 --> 00:15:51,460
Thank you, Mr. Yunhe.

273
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:53,900
Chong.

274
00:15:54,980 --> 00:15:56,340
Take a good rest.

275
00:15:59,060 --> 00:15:59,940
I will, Mother.

276
00:16:49,020 --> 00:16:49,700

You're finally awake.

Your friend

284
00:17:01,370 --> 00:17:02,580
is so unreasonable.

285
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,220
She said if I couldn't save you,

286
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,300
she would not only take the consultation fee back,

287
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:08,180
but also my funeral money.

288
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:08,940

289
00:17:08,940 --> 00:17:09,290
check

290
00:17:09,290 --> 00:17:10,470

Calm down.

Calm down.

He's fine now.

295

a bad flu.

Fortunately, he has been in good health before.

I knew it.

300

There is no plague.

301

He just caught a flu.

Those refugees

almost killed Fu Hong.

Don't blame the refugees.

Is there an plague in Jian'an City?

Why don't we

00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:47,620
Give the knives back to her.

388
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:53,230
-This way, please. -Let's go.

389
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,350
Send a letter to Jian'an City.

390
00:21:00,500 --> 00:21:01,460
Tell them

391
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:03,020
Miss Zhuwan is here.

392
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:05,300
Ask the Deputy Governor how to deal with her.

393
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,340
Yes.

394
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:07,620
Mr. Xu.

395
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:09,230
How should we deal with these two?

396
00:21:12,180 --> 00:21:13,700
Since they came to me,

397
00:21:13,900 --> 00:21:15,510
they won't be able to leave here.

398
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:20,550
Be careful.

399
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,710
What a fragrant flower.

400
00:21:34,340 --> 00:21:35,340
You just recovered from the flu.

401
00:21:35,540 --> 00:21:36,420
Are you okay?

402
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,350
Yes.

403
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,030
Luckily, you were smart just now

404
00:21:39,260 --> 00:21:40,270
and said I was Murong Bao.

405
00:21:41,140 --> 00:21:41,860
Of course I'm smart.

406
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:44,820
Come in.

407
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:50,590
Miss Zhuwan.

408
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,250
This is the ginseng tea

409
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:52,780
Mr. Xu asked me to bring to you.

410
00:21:59,100 --> 00:21:59,980
Please enjoy.

411
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,980
Thank Mr. Xu for me.

412
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:02,700
Yes.

413
00:22:14,460 --> 00:22:15,700
I don't know who's trying to kill me.

414
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:19,340
But for the sake of safety,

415
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,420
we'd better not drink the tea.

416
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:24,540
What are we going to do?

417
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,860
In case something happens,

418
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:28,390
it's better for us to leave early.

419
00:22:29,210 --> 00:22:29,780
OK.

420
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:32,630
When I came in,

421
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,260
I paid special attention to the exits.

422
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:36,940
There are only four gates of the Xu family.

423
00:22:37,460 --> 00:22:38,950
The main gate is always closed.

424
00:22:39,260 --> 00:22:40,170
Family members usually

425
00:22:40,170 --> 00:22:41,670
take the two side gates in the east and west.

426
00:22:41,810 --> 00:22:43,860
There's a small gate in the northwest,

427
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:45,800
which is for the servants.

428
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:47,110
We'll escape through that gate.

429
00:22:53,260 --> 00:22:54,980
Hey! Did you hear me?

430
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,310
Let's go.

431
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,180
Are you okay?

432
00:23:10,810 --> 00:23:11,540
Can you walk?

433
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:12,750
I'm fine.

434
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:20,860
Stop!

435
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:23,510
Chase them!

436
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:26,430
Before she left,

437
00:23:27,380 --> 00:23:28,510
she took away

438
00:23:28,620 --> 00:23:30,010
the stuff that doesn't belong to her

439
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:31,100
from the old residence.

440
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:32,980
Go and kill her.

441
00:23:45,180 --> 00:23:45,790
Xi.

442
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,140
Why are you here?

443
00:23:49,220 --> 00:23:50,220
They're chasing us.

444
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:50,860
Run!

445
00:23:51,570 --> 00:23:52,070
Miss Zhuwan.

446
00:23:52,380 --> 00:23:52,980
You go first.

447
00:23:53,420 --> 00:23:54,220
I'll stop them.

448
00:23:54,500 --> 00:23:54,940
No!

449
00:23:55,170 --> 00:23:55,900
It's too dangerous.

450
00:23:56,220 --> 00:23:57,710
There are many people behind.

451
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,570
Master Chong asked me

452
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:01,750
to protect you.

453
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:02,790
That's an order for me.

454
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:04,900
Fine.

455
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,770
If you're in danger, just run.

456
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:07,390
Run!

457
00:24:08,660 --> 00:24:09,270
Hurry! Go!

458
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:10,490
Be careful.

459
00:24:10,490 --> 00:24:12,140
Mr. Fu, it's too late.

460
00:25:32,820 --> 00:25:35,070
The traces of the Xie family's massacre

461
00:25:36,300 --> 00:25:37,700
and the traces found on the bodies in the back of the mountain

462
00:25:38,020 --> 00:25:39,820
on my birthday banquet

463
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:42,860
were all made by claw skills.

464
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:46,020
They seemed to be done by the same person.

465
00:25:50,660 --> 00:25:51,380
Claw skills?

466
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:56,670
Those people died of Divine Art of Shanhai?

467
00:25:59,770 --> 00:26:00,940
Besides me,

468
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,230
there're still others who have practiced Shanhai Secret Manual?

469
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,730
To kill the whole Xie family,

470
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:05,580
his level

471
00:26:06,180 --> 00:26:07,420
must be much higher than mine.

472
00:26:09,020 --> 00:26:10,220
Who could it be?

473
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:12,940
Master Chong.

474
00:26:13,180 --> 00:26:14,110
An urgent report.

475
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:14,820
What is it?

476
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:16,830
Miss Zhuwan

477
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,670
was detained by the Xu family.

478
00:26:17,860 --> 00:26:18,860
Master Fu fell off the cliff.

479
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:19,620
We don't know if he's alive.

480
00:26:23,530 --> 00:26:24,580
Is that true?

481
00:26:29,340 --> 00:26:30,140
I suspect someone is practicing

482
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:30,860
the Shanhai Secret Manual.

483
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:31,700
Keep an eye on it.

484
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:32,830
I'm leaving for Jian'an City.

485
00:26:33,100 --> 00:26:33,620
Chong.

486
00:26:35,780 --> 00:26:36,260
Mother.

487
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:38,860
Where are you going?

488
00:26:39,140 --> 00:26:40,260
On Hong's way back to Jian'an City,

489
00:26:40,260 --> 00:26:41,070
he was chased for a kill.

490
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:41,940
We don't know if he's alive or not.

491
00:26:42,300 --> 00:26:43,110
I'm going to save him.

492
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:44,220
Don't forget

493
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,580
you're the Chief of the Martial Arts World now.

494
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,350
So now

495
00:26:47,580 --> 00:26:48,260
he is

496
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,630
your biggest rival.

497
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,270
Mother,

498
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:52,150
as the Chief,

499
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,130
I can't ignore

500
00:26:53,130 --> 00:26:53,900
what had happened in Jianghu.

501
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,180
Besides,

502
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,940
Hong has been close to me since childhood.

503
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:58,420
He's my best friend.

504
00:26:58,860 --> 00:26:59,820
I must save him.

505
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:00,620
Xi Feng.

506
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:01,390
Yes.

507
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:03,180
Take a fast horse and set out immediately.

508
00:27:03,180 --> 00:27:03,750
Chong.

509
00:27:03,940 --> 00:27:04,350
You...

510
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,820
Fu Hong fell off the cliff.

511
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:51,230
Is he alive or not?

512
00:27:52,780 --> 00:27:53,380
We don't know yet.

513
00:27:54,820 --> 00:27:56,180
All right, you may leave.

514
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:18,460
You loser.

515
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,220
If there wasn't some one helped,

516
00:28:22,420 --> 00:28:23,620
they would have run away.

517
00:28:25,500 --> 00:28:27,650
Zhuwan has a maid.

518
00:28:27,650 --> 00:28:28,860
She's very skilled in martial arts.

519
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,070
She has been holding us back.

520
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:33,100
I had no better solutions.

521
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:38,710
Tell them

522
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:40,700
that we caught a girl

523
00:28:40,900 --> 00:28:42,780
who pretended to be Murong Zhuwan.

524
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,940
And she will be executed at noon tomorrow.

525
00:28:45,540 --> 00:28:46,300
I believe

526
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:48,390
Fu Hong will show up after hearing this news

527
00:28:48,940 --> 00:28:51,180
as long as he's alive.

528
00:28:52,260 --> 00:28:52,740
Yes.

529
00:28:53,620 --> 00:28:54,180
Understood.

530
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:17,500
Young Master!

531
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,220
Young Master!

532
00:29:26,060 --> 00:29:26,700
Young Master!

533
00:29:29,820 --> 00:29:30,500
Young Master!

534
00:29:32,980 --> 00:29:33,500
Young Master!

535
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:36,820
Young Master!

536
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:52,180
Young Master!

537
00:29:55,060 --> 00:29:56,030
Young Master, are you alright?

538
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:00,780
Zhuwan?

539
00:30:01,980 --> 00:30:02,620
Young Master.

540
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:04,780
Meng Tang.

541
00:30:05,340 --> 00:30:06,110
Why are you here?

542
00:30:28,500 --> 00:30:29,540
Where is Fu Hong?

543
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:31,590
Is anyone there?

544
00:30:33,260 --> 00:30:33,820
Hello?

545
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:39,020
I'm Murong Zhuwan from Murong family.

546
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:41,380
I'm the sibling of the Chief of the Martial Arts World.

547
00:30:41,660 --> 00:30:42,860
Who dares to lock me up?

548
00:30:44,020 --> 00:30:44,590
Stop shouting.

549
00:30:45,340 --> 00:30:46,510
You're over bold.

550
00:30:46,740 --> 00:30:48,260
How dare you pretend to be Miss Murong?

551
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,630
The real Miss Murong

552
00:30:49,860 --> 00:30:50,740
is in Mount Shengyue.

553
00:30:51,460 --> 00:30:52,590
Wait to be sentenced to death here.

554
00:30:53,540 --> 00:30:54,510
Nonsense!

555
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:56,390
I have the golden seal.

556
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:00,620
Where is my golden seal?

557
00:31:02,900 --> 00:31:03,820
Where are you?

558
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,780
Let me out!

559
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:07,950
Where are you?

560
00:31:10,420 --> 00:31:11,540
Let me out!

561
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:19,140
Uncle Sou.

562
00:31:21,700 --> 00:31:22,260
Yao.

563
00:31:22,620 --> 00:31:23,220
What is it?

564
00:31:23,660 --> 00:31:24,180
Uncle Sou.

565
00:31:24,460 --> 00:31:25,720
I heard that someone pretended to be Zhuwan

566
00:31:25,720 --> 00:31:26,700
and got caught by you.

567
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:27,890
Let me meet her.

568
00:31:27,890 --> 00:31:29,180
I met Zhuwan before.

569
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:29,990
Yao.

570
00:31:30,500 --> 00:31:32,270
I've confirmed it.

571
00:31:32,540 --> 00:31:33,020
That

572
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:34,460
is a fake one.

573
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,900
The real Miss Zhuwan

574
00:31:36,100 --> 00:31:37,790
is in Mount Shengyue now.

575
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:41,660
But...

576
00:31:47,820 --> 00:31:48,510
Yao,

577
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:50,740
the late Chief just passed away.

578
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:52,270
How can Miss Zhuwan

579
00:31:52,380 --> 00:31:52,780
come to our

580
00:31:52,780 --> 00:31:54,150
Jian'an City?

581
00:31:56,340 --> 00:31:57,380
Don't worry.

582
00:31:57,740 --> 00:31:59,660
I met Miss Zhuwan before too.

583
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,380
It can't be wrong.

584
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,230
All right.

585
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,940
I'll go back now.

586
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,630
The Deputy Governor ordered

587
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,110
that at three quarter past noon today,

588
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,260
you'll be executed at the execution ground of East Street

589
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,540
and displayed in public.

590
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,310
This is your last meal.

591
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,950
Eat more before going to the Netherworld.

592
00:32:41,220 --> 00:32:42,510
You're the one who's going to die.

593
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,750
I'm not going to die!

594
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:45,020
I want to see Uncle Sou.

595
00:32:45,020 --> 00:32:45,470
Let's go.

596
00:32:47,220 --> 00:32:47,950
Don't go.

597
00:32:50,300 --> 00:32:51,530
When I see Uncle Sou,

598
00:32:51,530 --> 00:32:52,930
I'll teach you a lesson.

599
00:32:52,930 --> 00:32:53,370
You guys...

600
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,940
How dare you look down on me!

601
00:32:59,980 --> 00:33:00,500
Kneel!

602
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:02,050
It's the time!

603
00:33:02,050 --> 00:33:02,710
Execute!
