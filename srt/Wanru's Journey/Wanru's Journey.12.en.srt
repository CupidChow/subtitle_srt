Kneel.

00:01:42,820 --> 00:01:43,460
He seems

7
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:44,820
not convinced.

8
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,620
He's my brother's loyal servant, Crow.

9
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:48,700
Of course he won't say anything.

10
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:52,660
Then what are you going to do?

11
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,020
Send a letter

12
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:56,700
to Mount Shengyue via the open way.

13
00:01:57,180 --> 00:01:58,460
Tell them I was assassinated

14
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:00,180
and the assassin confessed everything.

15
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:01,620
And Murong Wei

16
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:03,380
is the one who wants to kill me.

17
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,940
If I have a way

18
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:10,539
to make him confess,

19
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:12,140
how are you going to thank me?

20
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:14,340
You have a way?

21
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,660
Although he's severely injured,

22
00:02:21,890 --> 00:02:22,460
maybe

23
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,820
he will risk his life.

24
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:28,780

This is called the Laugh Acupoint.

32
00:02:55,730 --> 00:02:56,980
It's a common method

33
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:57,940
to interrogate criminals in the martial arts world.

34
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:00,770
It's extremely vicious.

35
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,780
It won't cause external injuries

36
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,220
or any pain.

37
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,100

00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,100

00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:07,820
Let's go.

197
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:15,180
[Jixiang Inn]

198
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:29,180
The dishes are all served.

199
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,220
Why aren't they back yet?

200
00:10:31,260 --> 00:10:33,420
What did it take them so long to buy?

201
00:10:33,860 --> 00:10:34,980
I'm starving.

202
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:42,220
Should I eat one secretly?

203
00:10:42,770 --> 00:10:44,380
I don't think they'll find out.

204
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:55,140
Zhuwan.

205
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:56,180
You're back.

206
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,860
I just thought whether the dish had became cold.

207
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:58,780
I wanted to try the temperature.

208
00:10:58,980 --> 00:11:00,010
You're back just in time.

209
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:01,890
These are gifts

210
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,780
we bought for you.

211
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:05,890
You even bought me gifts?

212
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,020
So nice.

213
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:07,940
Come, have a seat.

214
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:08,900
Have a seat.

215
00:11:09,020 --> 00:11:09,340
Here.

216
00:11:12,410 --> 00:11:13,220
I also saw a lot of trinkets

217
00:11:13,460 --> 00:11:14,460
in the market.

218
00:11:14,900 --> 00:11:15,820
I thought you might like them.

219
00:11:16,140 --> 00:11:16,860
So I bought all kinds of them.

220
00:11:25,700 --> 00:11:27,060
Look at the color.

221
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:28,620
Look at the appearance.

222
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,300
It's really good.

223
00:11:31,820 --> 00:11:32,460
Hong.

224
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:34,060
What a coincidence.

225
00:11:34,580 --> 00:11:35,860
I also bought a Ruyi.

226
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:38,540
We have

227
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:40,980
the same taste.

228
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,100

229
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:45,460
So big.

00:11:47,780 --> 00:11:48,340
Brother.

231
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,340
You are so generous today.

232
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:53,820
By the way,

233
00:11:54,900 --> 00:11:56,300
I know you like novels.

234
00:11:56,530 --> 00:11:57,660
So I prepared them for you.

235
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:04,380
[A Lady of Unsurpassed Beauty]

236
00:12:03,820 --> 00:12:05,020
You even bought this?

237
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:06,140
I heard that

238
00:12:06,180 --> 00:12:07,420
after taking my advice,

239
00:12:07,890 --> 00:12:09,060
they started to limit purchases.

240
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,580
It's hard to buy this.

241
00:12:12,060 --> 00:12:13,060

243
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,660
So I know the boss there.

244
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,410
This is for you.

245
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,460

these are cakes from Yu's Pastry.

247
00:12:34,740 --> 00:12:36,020
Their cakes are very famous.

248
00:12:36,460 --> 00:12:37,620
Meng Tang queued up for a long time.

249
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:39,060
You like sweets.

250
00:12:39,140 --> 00:12:39,820
Of course.

251
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:40,860

Zhuwan.

253
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:42,980
Look.

I'm

258
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,380
afraid Meng Tang is too tired.

259
00:12:57,700 --> 00:12:58,980
Lining up is troublesome.

260
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,260
With this card,

261
00:13:00,650 --> 00:13:01,490

And it's free.

265
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:13,580
I'm not as thoughtful as Chong.

266
00:13:14,420 --> 00:13:15,060
I'm flattered.

267
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,100
Well,

268
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:20,780

00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,740
Have a shrimp. Your favorite.

273
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:33,450
Thank you.

274
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,020
Zhuwan.

275
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,780
This is tofu. Your favorite.

276
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,660
It helps digestion.

277
00:13:36,740 --> 00:13:37,180
Thank you.

278
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:38,260
Zhuwan.

279
00:13:38,620 --> 00:13:39,730
This is their specialty.

280
00:13:40,100 --> 00:13:40,810
Braised Pork.

281
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:41,940
Zhuwan.

282
00:13:42,380 --> 00:13:44,500
This is their Shredded Pork with Green Pepper.

283
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:45,540
Eat more green pepper.

284
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:46,500
It's good for your stomach.

285
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,460
And this bamboo shoots.

286
00:13:49,340 --> 00:13:50,180
This is cooked by the melting snow water

287
00:13:50,380 --> 00:13:52,500
from Mt. Tianshan.

288
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,410
Well,

289
00:13:58,620 --> 00:13:59,580
we'd better not eat for now.

290
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,060
Let's drink first. Cheers.

291
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:18,980
One more.

292
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:29,770
Nanny.

293
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,060
Miss, let's go.

294
00:14:33,260 --> 00:14:33,700
Miss!

295
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:40,420
Murder!

296
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:41,180
Run!

297
00:15:43,020 --> 00:15:44,100
Do you know

298
00:15:44,180 --> 00:15:45,450
there's a place called...

299
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:47,300
called?

300
00:15:48,660 --> 00:15:49,780
Su County.

301
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:51,620
In that place,

302
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,220
no one dares

303
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:55,020
to contradict me.

304
00:15:56,020 --> 00:15:56,940
Try it if you don't believe me.

305
00:15:57,180 --> 00:15:58,940
Mention me when you go there.

306
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:01,660
No one will dare to bully you.

307
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,340
I'll protect you.

308
00:16:09,020 --> 00:16:10,180
You don't believe me?

309
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:15,220
I must show you

310
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,260
today.

311
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:29,260
Hong,

312
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:30,980
why don't you send her back?

313
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,420
You should send her back.

314
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:34,780
It might not be appropriate for me

315
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:35,780
to send her back.

316
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:36,730
You send her.

317
00:16:37,370 --> 00:16:37,770
Okay.

318
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,340
I can help her pack the gifts

319
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,380
and send her back.

320
00:16:40,540 --> 00:16:40,820
Okay.

321
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,300
Uncle.

322
00:17:42,420 --> 00:17:42,900
Go away.

323
00:17:46,980 --> 00:17:48,410
I'm exhausted.

324
00:17:50,260 --> 00:17:52,380
I asked the kitchen staff to make hangover soup.

325
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,580
Have some later.

326
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,740
I don't want to.

327
00:18:00,580 --> 00:18:01,500
Go out.

328
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,940
I'm going to lock the door.

329
00:18:03,380 --> 00:18:04,060
As soon as I send you back,

330
00:18:04,180 --> 00:18:05,100
you want me to leave?

331
00:18:06,100 --> 00:18:07,180
If it were Hong,

332
00:18:07,900 --> 00:18:09,180
you wouldn't be like this.

333
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:10,460
Can you stop

334
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:11,820
being unreasonable?

335
00:18:12,860 --> 00:18:13,980
I'm being unreasonable?

336
00:18:18,340 --> 00:18:19,820
Get out.

337
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:21,300
Get out.

338
00:18:25,740 --> 00:18:27,290
Do you really like Hong that much?

339
00:18:27,860 --> 00:18:28,620
Do you have to marry him?

340
00:18:29,860 --> 00:18:31,340
So noisy.

341
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,740
Why is it that

342
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,460
you always Kabe-Don me?

343
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:38,380
It's my turn this time.

344
00:18:44,090 --> 00:18:44,530
Yes.

345
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:46,540
I'm being noisy.

346
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,260
If it were Hong,

347
00:18:48,420 --> 00:18:49,660
you wouldn't think so.

348
00:18:50,060 --> 00:18:51,380
Shut up.

349
00:19:16,940 --> 00:19:17,820
Give me a hug.

350
00:19:30,500 --> 00:19:31,220
Don't.

351
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:12,300
My head hurts.

352
00:20:13,780 --> 00:20:14,740
Why did I drink so much

353
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,860
with Fu Hong and Murong Chong?

354
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:18,580
I've lost my memory.

355
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:25,620
Why did I drink with

356
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,220
Fu Hong and Murong Chong?

357
00:20:28,060 --> 00:20:28,660
What if I got drunk

358
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,020
and talked nonsense?

359
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,860
Don't be nervous.

360
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,340
Don't be nervous.

361
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,930
Take a good look back.

362
00:20:36,580 --> 00:20:37,260
Take a good look back.

363
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:54,740
It can't be...

364
00:20:56,060 --> 00:20:56,980
It can't be true.

365
00:20:57,770 --> 00:20:58,420
If it's true,

366
00:20:58,540 --> 00:21:00,300
Murong Chong must kill me.

367
00:21:00,580 --> 00:21:02,210
He'll chop me into pieces and tear my body apart.

368
00:21:02,620 --> 00:21:03,250
Impossible.

369
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,340
Don't be nervous.

370
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:13,940
Forget about it.

371
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,660
I'll go to Father first.

372
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,100
If anything happens,

373
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:18,060
he can save me.

374
00:21:24,490 --> 00:21:24,940
Morning.

375
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:27,740
Morning.

376
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,140
What are you going to do?

377
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:36,180
Escape?

378
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:37,860
How is that possible?

379
00:21:39,500 --> 00:21:39,940
I...

380
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,740
I suddenly miss Father.

381
00:21:41,930 --> 00:21:43,140
I'll visit him.

382
00:21:54,020 --> 00:21:54,820
Do you remember

383
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,260
what you did last night?

384
00:21:58,260 --> 00:21:59,460
Last night?

385
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:01,420
I

386
00:22:01,690 --> 00:22:02,460
was drunk

387
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,940
and fell asleep.

388
00:22:07,340 --> 00:22:08,180
Think again.

389
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,500

00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,540
Didn't you also

582
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,380
survive on her life?

583
00:30:11,300 --> 00:30:12,100
This palm attack

584
00:30:12,700 --> 00:30:14,140
is to avenge the death of

585
00:30:14,340 --> 00:30:14,900
Murong Zhuwan.

586
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:53,690
Tell our men

587
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,740
to try everything to search for Yao.

588
00:30:56,380 --> 00:30:57,860
We must find her before sunset.

589
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:58,580
Yes.

590
00:31:01,940 --> 00:31:02,380
Young Master.

591
00:31:03,380 --> 00:31:03,980
We found Miss Yao.

592
00:31:04,380 --> 00:31:05,020
She's at Murong Mansion.

593
00:31:05,380 --> 00:31:05,980
She was taken back

594
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,300
by Master Chong and Miss Zhuwan.

595
00:31:09,340 --> 00:31:10,540
Why did Yao meet them?

596
00:31:12,100 --> 00:31:12,740
Let's go to Murong Mansion.

597
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:25,340
What are you doing?

598
00:31:27,700 --> 00:31:28,420
Sister-in-law.

599
00:31:29,260 --> 00:31:31,180
Mr. Murong is so handsome.

600
00:31:31,540 --> 00:31:34,380
There must be many people who like him, right?

601
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,060
Indeed. There seem to be

602
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,540
many people who like him.

603
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:46,010
Sister-in-law,

604
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:50,740
if I say I like Mr. Murong,

605
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:52,330
will you help me?

606
00:31:54,980 --> 00:31:56,140
Sister-in-law,

607
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,140
please help me.

608
00:31:57,140 --> 00:31:58,380
You like Murong Chong?

609
00:31:58,940 --> 00:31:59,980
I'll help you.

610
00:32:00,020 --> 00:32:01,300
Let's become a family.

611
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,820
Sister-in-law.

612
00:32:03,540 --> 00:32:05,540
Sister-in-law, you are so nice.

613
00:32:06,540 --> 00:32:06,980
Sister-in-law.

614
00:32:07,580 --> 00:32:08,540
Have some tea.

615
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:09,460
Let me pour you some.

616
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:12,490
Sister-in-law, have some tea.

617
00:32:12,980 --> 00:32:13,700
Have some tea.

618
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,300
I'm getting changed.

619
00:32:27,460 --> 00:32:28,820
Why did you come in without knocking?

620
00:32:28,940 --> 00:32:29,330
Then I...

621
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,460
What are you doing?

622
00:32:33,820 --> 00:32:34,420
In your heart,

623
00:32:35,780 --> 00:32:36,300
am I just

624
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,540
an insignificant person?

625
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,740
What are you talking about?

626
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:40,540
Tell me.

627
00:32:41,940 --> 00:32:43,810
How do you feel about me?

628
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,340
Don't skirt the topic.

629
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:46,860
I want to know

630
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:48,010
your true thoughts.
