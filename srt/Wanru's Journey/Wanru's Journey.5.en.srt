[Episode 5]

00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:34,140
Teng

5
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,450
is still glib.

6
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:37,729
I heard you prepared

7
00:01:37,729 --> 00:01:39,750
the Western luminous pearls for Chong.

8
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,910
Thank you.

9
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:48,370
Is this Phoenix-Bird-Shaped Jade Water Pot from the early Han dynasty?

10
00:01:48,370 --> 00:01:49,940
Who prepared it?

11
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:51,250
My father got it by accident.

12
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,979
Although you come from a rich family,

13
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:54,009
this gift

14
00:01:54,009 --> 00:01:56,050
is too valuable.

15
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:57,570
Chong helped me for two years

16
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:58,950
during my stay in Mount Shengyue.

17
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,590
It was the least I could do.

18
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,190
Auntie.

19
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,570
These are the unique books

20
00:02:08,570 --> 00:02:09,699
my father collected before his death.

21
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:11,990
They are indeed precious.

22
00:02:14,620 --> 00:02:15,630
Siyun.

23
00:02:16,540 --> 00:02:17,850
I feel a little dizzy.

24
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:19,310
I'm going out for some fresh air.

25
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,480
It's about time.

26
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:25,870
Yes.

27
00:02:47,940 --> 00:02:48,950
Master.

28
00:02:49,610 --> 00:02:50,440
Over there.

29
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:51,550
Yes.

30
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,210
This is the first time that Zhuwan has come

31
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:12,790
to Chong's birthday dinner.

32
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:13,860
I wonder what gift

33
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:15,270
she prepared.

34
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:25,150
A gift you've never seen.

35
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,790
The gift Zhuwan prepared

36
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:47,150
must be very special.

37
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:52,829
Give me a hand.

38
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:02,610
What is this?

39
00:04:02,610 --> 00:04:03,910
It's so ugly.

40
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:06,230
You're not informed.

41
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:07,660
It is understandable that you haven't seen it before.

42
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:09,130
What are you talking about?

43
00:04:09,130 --> 00:04:10,830
It doesn't matter.

44
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:13,790
This...

45
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,990
Is this the birthday gift you gave me?

46
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:16,910
Yes.

47
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:19,709
Happy Birthday Cake.

48
00:04:20,300 --> 00:04:24,070
Happy Birthday Cake.

49
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:25,550
Cake?

50
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:28,070
What is this for?

51
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,060
I heard that when foreigners

52
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:32,730
celebrate their birthdays,

53
00:04:32,730 --> 00:04:33,630
they eat

54
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:35,270
Happy Birthday Cake.

55
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:36,900
So I made it

56
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:38,270
based on my imagination.

57
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:40,620
This...

58
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,570
This is for eating?

59
00:04:42,570 --> 00:04:43,650
Of course.

60
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:44,950
Try it.

61
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:16,630
Brother, you can't eat it.

62
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:18,310
This thing is so strange.

63
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:20,070
It might be harmful to your health.

64
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,380
Right.

65
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,950
Brother.

66
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,670
I'm your biological sister.

67
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,230
Do you think I'll harm you?

68
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:47,670
Is it delicious?

69
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,430
How is it?

70
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,230
Not bad.

71
00:06:09,930 --> 00:06:11,190
Send it to my room later.

72
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:12,310
I'll eat it for supper.

73
00:06:12,460 --> 00:06:13,060
All right.

74
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,390
Take it away.

75
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:15,610
All right.

76
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:16,950
Thank you, Zhuwan.

77
00:06:16,950 --> 00:06:17,980
Sit back.

78
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:19,270
Yes, Mom.

79
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:11,670
I flew into the flowers.

80
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:27,700
The sound of the qin which Yueying is playing is melodious.

81
00:07:28,980 --> 00:07:31,790
Qing's dance is beautiful and elegant.

82
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:34,310
Excellent!

83
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:48,350
Bao.

84
00:07:49,700 --> 00:07:51,390
I ate too fast.

85
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:53,190
I need to go to the toilet.

86
00:07:56,659 --> 00:07:57,670
Miss.

87
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:01,870
I'm fine.

88
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,430
I just got a stomachache.

89
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:04,830
I'm fine.

90
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,150
The house of the Murong family is so big.

91
00:09:22,700 --> 00:09:23,780
Where can I find

92
00:09:23,780 --> 00:09:25,750
the secrect of my origin?

93
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,070
There's treasure.

94
00:09:49,700 --> 00:09:50,940
Have those dancers arrived?

95
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:52,030
Yes, they have.

96
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,950
Give it to her.

97
00:09:56,190 --> 00:09:58,030
She knows what to do.

98
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:07,710
Miss Zhuwan.

99
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:09,630
What is she doing?

100
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,190
Okay.

101
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:15,530
It's time to celebrate

102
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:16,830
my brother's birthday.

103
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:30,750
Mom.

104
00:10:31,420 --> 00:10:32,460
Take a seat.

105
00:10:34,340 --> 00:10:35,310
Brother.

106
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,510
Today is your birthday.

107
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:38,030
I'm late.

108
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,230
Will you blame me?

109
00:10:41,460 --> 00:10:42,230
Of course not.

110
00:10:42,940 --> 00:10:43,910
You came here.

111
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,630
I should treat you with courtesy.

112
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:47,110
I'm glad you didn't blame me.

113
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,070
Today is your birthday.

114
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,870
I have nothing valuable to give you.

115
00:10:52,500 --> 00:10:53,630
This bow

116
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,850
was given to me by Dad for a hunt

117
00:10:55,850 --> 00:10:56,750
when I was 14.

118
00:10:56,980 --> 00:10:59,400
Now, I'd like to take it as a birthday present

119
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,030
and give it to you.

120
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:02,470
Brother.

121
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:04,190
This is the only thing

122
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:05,950
Dad gave you.

123
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,630
It is very important.

124
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:08,820
How can I take it?

125
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,570
Brother.

126
00:11:09,570 --> 00:11:10,740
Don't say that.

127
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,670
We are brothers.

128
00:11:12,860 --> 00:11:14,390
Don't talk about who things belong to.

129
00:11:14,540 --> 00:11:16,070
Aren't we close?

130
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,790
In that case,

131
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,390
I'll take it.

132
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:27,390
Brother.

133
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,820
Cheers.

134
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:37,050
I specially brought you

135
00:11:37,050 --> 00:11:38,350
some dancers from the Western Region

136
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:39,910
to celebrate your birthday.

137
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:41,790
Thank you, Brother.

138
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:43,190
Come in.

139
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,840
Wei.

140
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:38,490
Chief has been in seclusion for days.

141
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:39,550
As the eldest son,

142
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,850
you've worked hard

143
00:12:40,850 --> 00:12:42,150
for managing Murong Mansion.

144
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:44,400
I'd like to drink to you.

145
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,080
Teng, you're flattering me.

146
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,840
Although Dad is still in seclusion,

147
00:12:47,840 --> 00:12:48,970
Murong Mansion

148
00:12:48,970 --> 00:12:50,980
has always been managed by Mom.

149
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:53,350
I didn't work hard.

150
00:12:54,540 --> 00:12:55,470
I think

151
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,150
we should drink to Mom.

152
00:12:58,900 --> 00:12:59,500
Yes.

153
00:12:59,500 --> 00:13:00,830
Thank you, Wei.

154
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:03,250
Actually, you're always a child

155
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:04,790
in my eyes.

156
00:13:05,090 --> 00:13:07,670
I just want you to be safe and healthy.

157
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,670
Dealing with family things is tiring.

158
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:12,350
I can handle it alone.

159
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,140
Thank you

160
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,740
for your concern.

161
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:21,830
Young Master.

162
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:53,430
You bitch!

163
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:55,210
You're so clumsy.

164
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:56,530
You disturbed Master Fu.

165
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,840
Drag her away and beat her to death.

166
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,710
Master Wei.

167
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,710
I think she didn't mean it.

168
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,310
Forget about it.

169
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,510
Since Master Fu has asked,

170
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:06,910
get lost.

171
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:09,820
Yes.

172
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,270
Master Fu.

173
00:14:19,110 --> 00:14:20,730
I brought that dancer here.

174
00:14:20,730 --> 00:14:22,950
I didn't expect her to disturb you.

175
00:14:23,580 --> 00:14:25,070
I'm really sorry.

176
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,590
Give it to me.

177
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:33,870
Master Fu.

178
00:14:34,060 --> 00:14:36,100
Let me drink to you.

179
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,310
You don't have to be sorry.

180
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,590
It happened suddenly.

181
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:42,430
It was not your fault.

182
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:45,230
Master Wei, cheers.

183
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:47,260
Young Master.

184
00:14:47,260 --> 00:14:48,060
Cheers.

185
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,230
Wait a minute.

186
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:51,370
This...

187
00:14:51,370 --> 00:14:52,740
The alcohol smells good.

188
00:14:52,740 --> 00:14:53,220
I want to drink it too.

189
00:14:53,220 --> 00:14:54,230
Zhuwan.

190
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,370
I just want to drink with you.

191
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,830
This is Master Fu's alcohol.

192
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:01,390
Murong Zhuwan.

193
00:15:14,020 --> 00:15:15,260
I'm so scared.

194
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,450
Wei.

195
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:17,830
Are you okay?

196
00:15:18,620 --> 00:15:20,010
Zhuwan has been silly since childhood.

197
00:15:20,010 --> 00:15:21,530
I'm sure you won't be mad

198
00:15:21,530 --> 00:15:22,990
at her.

199
00:15:24,740 --> 00:15:25,910
Of course not.

200
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:29,470
Zhuwan, sit back.

201
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:36,350
That's impressive.

202
00:15:43,770 --> 00:15:44,550
Mom.

203
00:15:45,060 --> 00:15:46,990
I'm going to get changed.

204
00:15:47,740 --> 00:15:48,870
Go.

205
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:01,210
Guard the whole mansion.

206
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,100
Even flies

207
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,690
are not allowed to leave.

208
00:16:03,690 --> 00:16:05,210
Tell me about Master Wei's situation

209
00:16:05,210 --> 00:16:06,870
at any time.

210
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:07,960
Yes.

211
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:09,030
Go.

212
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:21,390
Master Wei, are you all right?

213
00:16:23,930 --> 00:16:24,980
Go and find an antidote.

214
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,160
Yes.

215
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:31,200
Murong Zhuwan.

216
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:34,350
I'll definitely kill you.

217
00:16:38,460 --> 00:16:39,150
Young Master.

218
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,740
I met a master.

219
00:16:41,420 --> 00:16:42,450
Is he from Mount Shengyue?

220
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,550
No, he isn't.

221
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:47,260
Is he from Jian'an City?

222
00:17:05,900 --> 00:17:07,950
Murong Chong's birthday dinner

223
00:17:07,950 --> 00:17:09,790
is really big.

224
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:12,390
All the gifts are treasures.

225
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:16,349
Our birthdays are on the same day.

226
00:17:16,540 --> 00:17:17,900
Why are the differences between different people

227
00:17:17,900 --> 00:17:19,869
so big?

228
00:17:25,420 --> 00:17:27,450
On my birthday,

229
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:28,590
I hope

230
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,210
I can make more money

231
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:32,710
by selling the books I write,

232
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:35,290
find out my origin as soon as possible,

233
00:17:35,290 --> 00:17:36,750
leave Murong Mansion,

234
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,870
and

235
00:17:42,330 --> 00:17:43,510
get rich.

236
00:17:45,260 --> 00:17:47,310
Happy birthday!

237
00:17:55,860 --> 00:17:56,950
Cheers.

238
00:18:00,380 --> 00:18:01,110
Why are you drinking here alone

239
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,830
at this late hour?

240
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:04,910
Why are you here?

241
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,020
Sit down.

242
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:10,470
Relax.

243
00:18:16,170 --> 00:18:17,610
Don't be fussy.

244
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:18,990
Come here.

245
00:18:27,730 --> 00:18:28,290
How did you know

246
00:18:28,290 --> 00:18:29,990
the alcohol was poisonous?

247
00:18:30,460 --> 00:18:32,070
The alcohol was poisonous?

248
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:35,830
Master Wei, I found the thing.

249
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:44,890
Have those dancers arrived?

250
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:45,750
Yes, they have.

251
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,540
Give it to her.

252
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,350
She knows what to do.

253
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:54,100
If Master Fu

254
00:18:54,100 --> 00:18:54,500
died

255
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,070
in the dinner held by Her Ladyship,

256
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:57,540
the Fu family

257
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:59,230
would definitely start a fight against the Murong family.

258
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:01,730
If Chief knew it,

259
00:19:01,730 --> 00:19:02,650
then...

260
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:04,720
Su would be dead

261
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,830
then.

262
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:08,910
I would kill Murong Chong in the chaos.

263
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:10,620
Who else dares to compete with me

264
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:12,670
for the head of the family?

265
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:14,090
I'd like

266
00:19:14,090 --> 00:19:15,660
to congratulate you in advance.

267
00:19:16,900 --> 00:19:18,030
Will we succeed?

268
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,070
Don't worry.

269
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,350
We will succeed.

270
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:23,750
I don't know.

271
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,350
You just came back to Murong Mansion.

272
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,630
I guess you haven't been familiar with this place yet.

273
00:19:31,850 --> 00:19:34,750
I just came back.

274
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:37,280
You've been living here for more than ten years.

275
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,030
I'm not as familiar with this place as you do.

276
00:19:40,740 --> 00:19:42,670
Let me show you around.

277
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,500
OK.

278
00:19:51,380 --> 00:19:54,270
There's such a quiet place in Murong Mansion.

279
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:22,550
Amazing.

280
00:20:42,020 --> 00:20:42,780
I...

281
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,830
I'll go for a walk alone.

282
00:20:45,180 --> 00:20:46,150
Okay.

283
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:51,630
So beautiful.

284
00:20:55,480 --> 00:21:02,540
[Dexin]

285
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:18,870
Today is my birthday.

286
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,710
You didn't give me a birthday gift.

287
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:22,870
And you performed a sword dance for her in the garden.

288
00:21:24,660 --> 00:21:25,620
Why do you think

289
00:21:25,620 --> 00:21:26,490
I didn't prepare

290
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:27,630
your birthday gift?

291
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,270
Where is it?

292
00:21:45,730 --> 00:21:46,580
There's no...

293
00:22:05,980 --> 00:22:10,030
What a good relationship!

294
00:22:20,430 --> 00:22:21,550
Master Wei.

295
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,550
The antidote.

296
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:27,750
I've sent people to get the antidote.

297
00:22:31,100 --> 00:22:32,070
Master Wei.

298
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:15,240
Hong.

299
00:23:15,870 --> 00:23:17,760
If Wanzhu hadn't snatched

300
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,670
the cup,

301
00:23:19,820 --> 00:23:20,940
would you have drunk the alcohol?

302
00:23:21,100 --> 00:23:22,550
If Zhuwan hadn't snatched it,

303
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:23,770
I wouldn't have embarrassed

304
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,910
Master Wei.

305
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:25,690
I'm afraid

306
00:23:25,690 --> 00:23:27,190
I would have already drunk the alcohol.

307
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,590
If you had known the alcohol was poisonous,

308
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,040
would you have drunk it too?

309
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:36,240
Why are you so tolerant?

310
00:23:37,060 --> 00:23:37,650
Although he is

311
00:23:37,650 --> 00:23:38,950
the eldest son of the Murong family,

312
00:23:39,100 --> 00:23:40,950
even if my father asked you to drink it,

313
00:23:41,070 --> 00:23:41,760
you don't have to

314
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:42,460
lose your life

315
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,660
for their sake.

316
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:44,870
If anything happened to you,

317
00:23:45,220 --> 00:23:46,020
the Fu family

318
00:23:46,020 --> 00:23:47,810
would come to Mount Shengyue for revenge.

319
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,740
Isn't that

320
00:23:48,740 --> 00:23:50,070
Murong Wei's trap?

321
00:23:50,180 --> 00:23:51,390
Since I dared to drink,

322
00:23:52,140 --> 00:23:54,110
it means I knew what to do.

323
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:56,890
Of course Murong Wei wouldn't let you

324
00:23:56,890 --> 00:23:58,650
be poisoned immediately after drinking his alcohol.

325
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,510
Yes.

326
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:01,530
You could find the antidote

327
00:24:01,530 --> 00:24:02,550
before you were poisoned to death.

328
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:04,630
But it was also an unknown risk.

329
00:24:04,740 --> 00:24:05,690
How could you risk

330
00:24:05,690 --> 00:24:06,830
your own life?

331
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:09,910
You are too tolerant

332
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,020
and considerate.

333
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,170
When can you think more

334
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:14,390
for yourself?

335
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,350
Okay. I promise you

336
00:24:26,620 --> 00:24:27,330
that I will think more for myself

337
00:24:27,330 --> 00:24:28,430
in the future.

338
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,450
But because of this,

339
00:24:30,450 --> 00:24:32,270
I do owe Zhuwan a life.

340
00:24:34,090 --> 00:24:35,980
Zhuwan always acts like a crazy person.

341
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:37,850
Maybe she didn't know

342
00:24:37,850 --> 00:24:38,630
what she did before.

343
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:39,710
Hong.

344
00:24:40,410 --> 00:24:42,270
Zhuwan is not the right person for you.

345
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,560
She's not as naive

346
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:44,510
as you think.

347
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,390
Don't get too close to her.

348
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:50,130
But her behavior

349
00:24:50,130 --> 00:24:51,320
is unique

350
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,350
and interesting.

351
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:53,980
Don't be fooled

352
00:24:53,980 --> 00:24:54,990
by her appearance.

353
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,710
I won't harm you.

354
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:58,350
I'm engaged to her.

355
00:24:59,020 --> 00:25:00,560
That is just an idea you had

356
00:25:00,560 --> 00:25:02,650
when you were little.

357
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:04,830
Stop restricting yourself to it.

358
00:25:06,500 --> 00:25:07,830
Forget it.

359
00:25:08,340 --> 00:25:09,630
It's getting late.

360
00:25:09,740 --> 00:25:11,430
Let me take you back to your room first.

361
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:13,990
Let's go.

362
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,310
Master Wei.

363
00:25:31,900 --> 00:25:32,910
The antidote.

364
00:25:33,170 --> 00:25:34,270
I've sent people to get it,

365
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:35,990
but they were being intercepted along the way.

366
00:25:36,090 --> 00:25:37,430
The antidote...

367
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:41,270
Su is so evil.

368
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:51,190
The antidote. Hurry up. Give me the antidote.

369
00:25:52,090 --> 00:25:53,390
You idiot.

370
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:55,790
What do you mean?

371
00:26:00,940 --> 00:26:03,310
You're so impetuous.

372
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,630
I need to think about

373
00:26:06,740 --> 00:26:07,900
whether I should continue

374
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:09,300
to cooperate with you.

375
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,310
It is not easy for you

376
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:14,230
to get rid of me now.

377
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:24,030
The eldest son of the Murong family

378
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:26,390
intended to kill the young master of the Fu family for his own ends

379
00:26:26,740 --> 00:26:28,270
and frame Su.

380
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:29,590
What?

381
00:26:29,910 --> 00:26:32,070
Are you still trying to slander me?

382
00:26:34,970 --> 00:26:36,000
Tell me.

383
00:26:37,020 --> 00:26:39,050
If Fu Hong knew

384
00:26:39,050 --> 00:26:41,040
what you did before,

385
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,990
what would he do?

386
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,670
Are you threatening me?

387
00:26:44,850 --> 00:26:46,300
If I couldn't live,

388
00:26:46,940 --> 00:26:49,310
I would die with you.

389
00:27:09,860 --> 00:27:11,110
That fool

390
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:14,310
always sabotaged our plan.

391
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:17,070
Kill her as soon as possible.

392
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:19,300
She won't live long.

393
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,510
Open it.

394
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:39,480
Auntie,

395
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,990
you look so radiant today.

396
00:27:42,460 --> 00:27:43,420
Of course.

397
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,730
Although Auntie is a woman,

398
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:46,010
everyone thinks

399
00:27:46,010 --> 00:27:48,010
that Auntie is as good as men.

400
00:27:48,010 --> 00:27:50,110
You two are honey-tongued.

401
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:56,830
Madam.

402
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,070
Auntie.

403
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:08,150
What happened?

404
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,470
Nothing.

405
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,450
A thief

406
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:12,750
was just caught.

407
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:13,990
Sit still.

408
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,860
I'll be right back.

409
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,910
Madam.

410
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,630
Ji Lan, what happened?

411
00:28:29,780 --> 00:28:30,470
Madam.

412
00:28:30,660 --> 00:28:32,020
These people tried to break in the forbidden area

413
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:33,340
when the defences here were weak

414
00:28:33,340 --> 00:28:34,170
because of the birthday dinner,

415
00:28:34,170 --> 00:28:35,620
but they were killed by an unknown master.

416
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,590
No one survived.

417
00:28:38,180 --> 00:28:39,210
Have you found out

418
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:40,370
their identities?

419
00:28:40,370 --> 00:28:41,690
They were all warriors who dared to die.

420
00:28:41,690 --> 00:28:42,980
There is no clue.

421
00:28:46,740 --> 00:28:48,750
That person is skilful.

422
00:28:49,140 --> 00:28:52,020
Did you find out who did it?

423
00:28:52,380 --> 00:28:53,870
According to the disciples who were on patrol,

424
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:55,800
there were not many guards here.

425
00:28:55,800 --> 00:28:56,820
When they heard the sound of a struggle

426
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:58,010
and rushed here,

427
00:28:58,010 --> 00:28:59,350
they had already died here.

428
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:06,270
Today is Chong's birthday.

429
00:29:06,500 --> 00:29:08,390
No one is allowed

430
00:29:08,500 --> 00:29:10,570
to tell others what happened here.

431
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:12,010
Understood?

432
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:12,750
Yes.

433
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:16,070
Ji Lan.

434
00:29:16,940 --> 00:29:18,070
Clean it up.

435
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,910
Try to find clues.

436
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,860
Yes, Madam.

437
00:29:26,620 --> 00:29:29,670
Who killed these people?

438
00:29:36,260 --> 00:29:38,230
Murong Mansion is heavily guarded.

439
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:40,550
How did the thief come in

440
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:42,710
and find the study accurately?

441
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:45,590
It means he is familiar with Murong Mansion.

442
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,070
There is nothing lost.

443
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:52,030
Then why did he come here?

444
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:53,630
Xi Feng.

445
00:29:53,900 --> 00:29:54,900
When you were fighting,

446
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:55,610
did you tell

447
00:29:55,610 --> 00:29:56,970
which sect his kung fu were from?

448
00:29:56,970 --> 00:29:57,950
No, I didn't.

449
00:30:02,010 --> 00:30:02,850
A group of men who wore black clothes

450
00:30:02,850 --> 00:30:04,870
also broke in the forbidden area last night.

451
00:30:05,900 --> 00:30:08,270
Was it a diversion?

452
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,550
Or

453
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,270
is he someone who wanted to take advantage of the fight?

454
00:30:18,930 --> 00:30:23,260
[Dexin]

455
00:30:23,260 --> 00:30:24,270
Young Master.

456
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:27,130
Did you find anything last night?

457
00:30:27,130 --> 00:30:28,620
After I left the study,

458
00:30:28,620 --> 00:30:29,170
I met

459
00:30:29,170 --> 00:30:30,360
a person in black who wore a veil.

460
00:30:30,700 --> 00:30:32,010
He ran away because he couldn't defeat me.

461
00:30:32,010 --> 00:30:32,790
After that,

462
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,610
I saw Miss Zhuwan.

463
00:30:34,610 --> 00:30:35,690
Murong Zhuwan?

464
00:30:35,690 --> 00:30:36,550
Yes.

465
00:30:36,940 --> 00:30:38,470
She was peeking outside Murong Wei's window.

466
00:30:39,300 --> 00:30:40,990
Why did she do that?

467
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:42,620
I don't know.

468
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,450
How about

469
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,870
I pay attention to her these days?

470
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,950
Don't worry about her.

471
00:30:47,540 --> 00:30:48,670
Do your best to investigate the midwife.

472
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:54,880
[Dexin]

473
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:50,520
Yes, Young Master.

474
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,950
Murong Zhuwan.

475
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:59,180
What is

476
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,630
your real identity?

477
00:31:08,010 --> 00:31:08,740
Who

478
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:10,870
cursed me so early in the morning?
