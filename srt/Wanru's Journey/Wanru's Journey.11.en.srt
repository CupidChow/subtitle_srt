00:20:57,860 --> 00:20:59,270
You always skip along.

383
00:20:59,460 --> 00:21:00,270
What if you sprain your ankle

384
00:21:00,540 --> 00:21:01,890
and hurt yourself?

385
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:03,210
You're back.

386
00:21:01,950 --> 00:21:04,760
[Daughter of the Governor of Jian'an City, Fu Yao]

387
00:21:03,210 --> 00:21:04,250
Of course I had to come here

388
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,110
as soon as possible.

389
00:21:05,500 --> 00:21:06,110
Uncle Sou.

390
00:21:06,220 --> 00:21:07,080
Tell me.

391
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,470
What's so fun about Mount Shengyue?

392
00:21:08,570 --> 00:21:09,290
Where is my brother?

393
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:10,350
Does he miss me?

394
00:21:10,660 --> 00:21:11,420
Did he give me

395
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,780
any delicious food?

396
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:13,910
You.

397
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:16,870
Your brother misses you the most.

398
00:21:17,900 --> 00:21:19,020
He misses me.

399
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:20,490
But he didn't come back to see me.

400
00:21:20,490 --> 00:21:22,350
I haven't seen him for a long time.

401
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,940
The last time I saw him

402
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:28,230
was on New Year's Eve two years ago.

403
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:30,530
Hong

404
00:21:30,530 --> 00:21:31,830
has no choice.

405
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,610
But

406
00:21:32,610 --> 00:21:34,410
he misses you every day.

407
00:21:34,410 --> 00:21:34,850
Really?

408
00:21:34,850 --> 00:21:35,390
Yes.

409
00:21:36,020 --> 00:21:36,660
He also gave you

410
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,740
many good things.

411
00:21:38,220 --> 00:21:38,930
Where are they?

412
00:21:38,930 --> 00:21:39,550
Go and take a look.

413
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:40,740
Those things?

414
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,390
These things?

415
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:43,790
These are all for me?

416
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:45,710
Hong.

417
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:47,350
Chong.

418
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:49,450
I saw baggage

419
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:50,620
in your room.

420
00:21:50,740 --> 00:21:51,950
Are you going somewhere?

421
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,270
I want to go back to Academy first.

422
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:56,110
I have some questions about martial arts to ask Master Sheng.

423
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,370
Why are you in such a hurry to go back?

424
00:21:58,370 --> 00:21:59,170
If you have any questions,

425
00:21:59,170 --> 00:22:00,990
it is convenient for you to ask my father.

426
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,510
Chief is highly skilled in martial arts.

427
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:04,580
But his kung fu is different

428
00:22:04,580 --> 00:22:05,630
from Master Sheng's.

429
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:07,470
I won't bother him.

430
00:22:08,050 --> 00:22:08,790
All right.

431
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:10,550
But you must be careful

432
00:22:10,660 --> 00:22:11,750
on your way back.

433
00:22:12,140 --> 00:22:13,100
I'm afraid people from the Hidden Blade

434
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:14,380
will attack you again.

435
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:16,310
Chief has come back.

436
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:17,520
I think people from the Hidden Blade

437
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:18,670
dare not act rashly.

438
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:20,590
I'm worried about you.

439
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:22,190
Have you found any clues

440
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:23,790
to the owner of the hidden weapon?

441
00:22:25,290 --> 00:22:26,070
Not yet.

442
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,990
I suggest

443
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:30,390
you tell Chief this matter

444
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:31,910
and let him help you investigate.

445
00:22:32,820 --> 00:22:34,100
It is hard to avoid conspiracies.

446
00:22:34,460 --> 00:22:35,470
I'm afraid you'll be in danger again.

447
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,230
My father just came back.

448
00:22:38,330 --> 00:22:39,710
I want to tell him later.

449
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:42,100
Okay.

450
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:44,670
By the way,

451
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,610
I have to go to the old residence

452
00:22:46,610 --> 00:22:47,550
with Zhuwan.

453
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:48,620
We

454
00:22:50,090 --> 00:22:51,050
can only meet in Academy

455
00:22:51,050 --> 00:22:51,910
in a few days.

456
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:06,150
Where did you steal it?

457
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:08,670
I stole it?

458
00:23:14,220 --> 00:23:16,830
This is a gift from Mr. Fu.

459
00:23:19,500 --> 00:23:24,070
999 gold.

460
00:23:24,340 --> 00:23:26,110
Why did Hong give you this?

461
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,050
Because

462
00:23:28,050 --> 00:23:30,310
he knew I like it.

463
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:31,670
Mr. Fu

464
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,750
is gentle and considerate.

465
00:23:33,860 --> 00:23:35,300
More importantly, he is generous.

466
00:23:35,580 --> 00:23:37,500
Someone said he would deliver money to me,

467
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,790
but I don't know where it is.

468
00:23:46,340 --> 00:23:47,870
1,000 taels of silver in cash I promised you.

469
00:23:48,180 --> 00:23:49,580
1,000 taels of silver?

470
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,590
You're so nice, Brother.

471
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:01,420
Since you're not doing it

472
00:24:01,420 --> 00:24:02,380
in your own interests,

473
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:03,990
I won't persue the matter.

474
00:24:05,540 --> 00:24:06,270
If...

475
00:24:08,290 --> 00:24:08,930
If you need money

476
00:24:08,930 --> 00:24:10,550
in the future,

477
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,590
just tell me.

478
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:14,580
Future?

479
00:24:17,940 --> 00:24:20,660
There's no time like the present.

480
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,350
How about today?

481
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,830
You really have something.

482
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:34,630
You...

483
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,070
You're a girl.

484
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,230
How inappropriate!

485
00:24:54,500 --> 00:24:56,150
Are you shy?

486
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,510
Of course not.

487
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:03,830
Keep the money safe.

488
00:25:04,010 --> 00:25:05,420
I won't be responsible if you lose it.

489
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,230
Don't worry.

490
00:25:07,540 --> 00:25:09,150
I may not be good at other things.

491
00:25:09,460 --> 00:25:11,010
But I'm good at

492
00:25:11,010 --> 00:25:12,350
eating and hiding money.

493
00:25:13,890 --> 00:25:14,500
Turn around.

Miss Zhuwan.

499
00:26:06,580 --> 00:26:07,460
Where are you going?

500
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,450
I'm in poor health.

501
00:26:09,450 --> 00:26:10,110
Every month,

502
00:26:10,220 --> 00:26:11,510
I have to go home and get medicine.

503
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:13,190
I see.

504
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:14,870
Take care.

505
00:26:23,620 --> 00:26:24,150
Right.

506
00:26:25,460 --> 00:26:26,270
I remember

507
00:26:26,460 --> 00:26:27,790
I have to deal with something.

508
00:26:27,940 --> 00:26:28,870
You go in first.

509
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:29,710
I'll come to you later.

Sir.

513
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,830
Long time no see.

514
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:44,700
Miss Zhuwan.

515
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:46,210
I wonder

516
00:26:46,210 --> 00:26:47,130
why you are here.

517
00:26:47,130 --> 00:26:48,350
I'm here to look for something.

518
00:26:49,530 --> 00:26:50,980
Without Chief's order,

519
00:26:51,140 --> 00:26:53,150
I dare not let you in.

520
00:27:01,540 --> 00:27:02,360
I don't know

521
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:03,790
what this is.

522
00:27:04,020 --> 00:27:05,950
Chief insisted on giving it to me.

523
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,380
Sir,

524
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,910
look what this is.

525
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,260
No need.

00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,570
No need.

Didn't they say this secret study

534
00:28:06,240 --> 00:28:07,790
has treasure?

535
00:28:08,570 --> 00:28:09,310
That's it?

536
00:28:21,900 --> 00:28:23,260
The Zhou family.

537
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:41,740
These are just

538
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,150
ordinary books.

539
00:28:43,580 --> 00:28:45,190
There's no clue.

540
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,670
It looks valuable.

00:28:58,140 --> 00:28:58,800
I'll just take one.

542
00:28:58,800 --> 00:28:59,950
It's not too much.

543
00:29:07,660 --> 00:29:09,430
It's strange.

544
00:29:16,890 --> 00:29:18,510
It's quite advanced.

00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,660

[Zhuwan's birth mother Zhang and her younger sister Zhou were separated.]

[Zhou married into the Zhou family in Jian'an City.]

549
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:52,750
The Zhou family is in Jian'an City?

550
00:29:58,020 --> 00:29:58,630
Mom?

551
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:05,220
Is she really my mother?

552
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:11,210
It seems that I have to find a chance

553
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,780
to go to Jian'an City.

554
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,860
Where did you go?

555
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:31,170
We're

556
00:30:31,170 --> 00:30:32,420
friends who survived together.

557
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:33,870
There's nothing you can't tell me.

558
00:30:35,460 --> 00:30:37,030
I've been investigating

559
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:38,950
the killers that appeared in the survival drill.

560
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,070
It is said that it is related to Xianruo Pavilion.

561
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,100
What have you found?

562
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,350
The truth will be uncovered soon.

563
00:30:47,460 --> 00:30:48,590
Xianruo Pavilion

564
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,180
is not ordinary.

565
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,590
The person behind it

566
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:53,230
is not simple.

567
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:56,190
Speaking of Xianruo Pavilion, I want to ask

568
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,380
why

569
00:30:57,380 --> 00:30:58,420
they didn't kill me

570
00:30:58,420 --> 00:30:59,750
during the hunt.

571
00:31:02,300 --> 00:31:03,750
This only shows

572
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:06,110
the person behind Xianruo Pavilion

573
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:08,390
might be your acquaintance.

574
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:10,910
Come on.

575
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:12,340
How could people from the killer organization

576
00:31:12,340 --> 00:31:13,940
be my acquaintances?

577
00:31:15,420 --> 00:31:16,550
I don't know.

578
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:20,060
But we'll know

579
00:31:20,490 --> 00:31:21,830
the truth soon.

580
00:31:26,220 --> 00:31:26,780
By the way,

581
00:31:27,060 --> 00:31:27,910
I heard

582
00:31:28,690 --> 00:31:29,870
that you and Dad

583
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,350
get along well.

584
00:31:34,340 --> 00:31:35,380
I have to say

585
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:37,500
your father is so nice to me.

586
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,060
Because of his love,

587
00:31:39,060 --> 00:31:40,460
I can't bear to leave.

588
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:44,420
Do you really want to be my sister?

589
00:31:51,220 --> 00:31:51,810
It is good

590
00:31:51,810 --> 00:31:53,060
to be your sister.

591
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:55,510
I have food, drinks and money.

592
00:32:04,660 --> 00:32:06,300
Go shopping with me.

593
00:32:07,180 --> 00:32:07,830
No.

594
00:32:09,180 --> 00:32:10,790
Why are you so shameless?

595
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:12,050
I'm not going.

596
00:32:12,050 --> 00:32:12,610
Childish.

597
00:32:12,610 --> 00:32:13,070
Young Master.

598
00:32:15,740 --> 00:32:16,750
We caught him.
