[Episode 23]

4
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:41,020
I've recovered.

5
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:44,110
I've really recovered.

6
00:01:48,620 --> 00:01:50,370
Why don't you let me

7
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:51,539
go out for a while?

8
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:52,820
I'll be back soon.

9
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:54,060
Really soon.

10
00:01:59,940 --> 00:02:01,140
Brother is not here.

11
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:02,860
Zhuwan is not here.

12
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:04,620
Chong is not here either.

13
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,990
No one treats me well now.

14
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:11,460
I want to eat

15
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,380
sugar-coated haws

16
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:14,940
which are sweet, tasty,

17
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:17,380
sparkling

18
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:19,660
and red.

19
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,300
If my brother were here,

20
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,700
he would take me to buy

21
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:29,860
sugar-coated haws.

22
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:35,500
Governor, I feel better now.

23
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:39,590
You're injured.

24
00:02:39,780 --> 00:02:40,740
You should eat something good for nutrition.

25
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,310
Here. Try it.

26
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:47,990
Try it.

27
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:59,020
The fish is fresh.

28
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:12,060
Have you had breakfast?

29
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,630
Not yet.

30
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:14,780
That's right.

31
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,890
You haven't had breakfast.

32
00:03:15,890 --> 00:03:16,730
How can I eat first?

33
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,940
Wait. I'll go and cook.

34
00:03:25,020 --> 00:03:26,540
Does Meng Tang dislike

35
00:03:26,660 --> 00:03:28,110
the fish I cooked?

36
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,590
No, he doesn't.

37
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:37,990
Have a taste.

38
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,940
The fish head...

39
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:06,940
Is it delicious?

40
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:07,940
It's delicious.

41
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:12,930
I don't need to eat it.

42
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,380
I cooked it for Meng Tang.

43
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:15,630
Keep it for him.

44
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:17,660
I made a great effort.

45
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,540
Here you are.

46
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:38,510
Thank you.

47
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:55,260
Should I come back to him?

48
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,420
Chicken drumsticks.

49
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:01,110
Ru.

50
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:05,860
It's really you.

51
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:07,670
Chang.

52
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,710
It's really you.

53
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,590
Stop hugging me.

54
00:06:19,900 --> 00:06:20,970
I eat chicken drumsticks every day.

55
00:06:20,970 --> 00:06:21,950
I didn't lose weight.

56
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:24,230
Why are you in Jian'an City?

57
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:25,710
I knew what happened in the Murong family,

58
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:28,030
so I came to Jian'an City to look for you.

59
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:31,100
This house is what you asked Master Wei

60
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,140
to buy

61
00:06:32,260 --> 00:06:33,420
for homeless people.

62
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:36,380
I gave him so much money.

63
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,380
He bought this shabby house?

64
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:39,940
Yes.

65
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,820
Did Master Wei

66
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:46,750
give you a hard time?

67
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:47,970
No, he didn't.

68
00:06:47,970 --> 00:06:49,700
He had been taking good care of us.

69
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:50,930
According to your instructions,

70
00:06:50,930 --> 00:06:52,140
he bought houses

71
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,230
in Mount Shengyue

72
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:54,460
and Jian'an City.

73
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,430
He let many homeless people

74
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:57,780
live in the houses.

75
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:01,050
But he disappeared

76
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:02,380
a long time ago.

77
00:07:03,490 --> 00:07:04,570
I don't know

78
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,740
where he is.

79
00:07:06,940 --> 00:07:09,140
The situation outside is very serious.

80
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:11,020
You must take care of yourself.

81
00:07:11,780 --> 00:07:12,700
You also have to be careful

82
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:13,620
when you see Master Wei.

83
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,500
Understood?

84
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,180
Master Wei told me before

85
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,420
that you were coming to Jian'an City.

86
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,920
So I left marks

87
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:21,980
in this city.

88
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:23,140
I knew you would come to me

89
00:07:23,250 --> 00:07:24,660
when you saw them.

90
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:27,470
I'm glad you're fine.

91
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:30,030
Is Murong Chong really a bad person?

92
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,310
No, he isn't.

93
00:07:31,420 --> 00:07:33,250
But everyone thinks he is a bad person.

94
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:34,210
If you stayed with him,

95
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:36,180
they would catch you.

96
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:42,540
Many things

97
00:07:42,659 --> 00:07:44,070
happened these days.

98
00:07:44,380 --> 00:07:46,300
I don't have time to explain them to you.

99
00:07:46,540 --> 00:07:48,140
But I must tell you

100
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,860
he is a good man.

101
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,710
Is he good to you?

102
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,740
He is

103
00:07:58,940 --> 00:07:59,900
good to me.

104
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,900
Will you go to him?

105
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:08,910
I don't know.

106
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,900
Chang.

107
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,150
Let me ask you.

108
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:15,940
If I lied to you

109
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,510
for some reason

110
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,900
and made you sad,

111
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,930
would you come to help me

112
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:23,100
when I'm in trouble?

113
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,870
Of course. You've told me

114
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:26,750
friends should be loyal to each other.

115
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:29,110
You may lie to me

116
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,180
and make me angry,

117
00:08:30,380 --> 00:08:31,340
but no matter what,

118
00:08:31,460 --> 00:08:32,270
as long as you need me,

119
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:33,740
I will show up right away.

120
00:08:33,850 --> 00:08:35,620
This is what a real friend should do.

121
00:08:37,780 --> 00:08:39,620
Good friend.

122
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:40,830
Be careful.

123
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,510
Tomorrow,

124
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:48,340
I'll go and tell my father the truth.

125
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,730
I'll let you use your own identity

126
00:08:49,730 --> 00:08:51,390
to live in this world.

127
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,660
By then,

128
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,310
I'll marry you

129
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:56,100
with many dowries.

130
00:08:58,140 --> 00:08:59,660
If you want a peaceful life,

131
00:09:00,860 --> 00:09:02,510
stay with me.

132
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,590
I'll protect you.

133
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,940
Although Murong Chong lied to me,

134
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,590
he only has

135
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:09,870
me and Fu Hong.

136
00:09:10,660 --> 00:09:12,550
Even if there was nothing between us...

137
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,140
Ru.

138
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,940
I'm indebted to the Murong family.

139
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:17,260
I should go back and help him,

140
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,420
even as a friend.

141
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,070
Ru.

142
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:25,220
Chang.

143
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:26,670
I have something to do.

144
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:27,540
I need to go.

145
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:29,390
Take care of yourself and wait for me.

146
00:09:32,660 --> 00:09:33,700
Take this.

147
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:42,230
Hong.

148
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:43,620
Chong.

149
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:44,850
I've found

150
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:46,260
the secret of Shanhai Secret Manuals.

151
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:47,910
You learnt from Volume I.

152
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,390
I learnt from Volume II.

153
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,620
Volume I is yang. Volume II is yin.

154
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,390
Only by balancing yin and yang

155
00:09:53,490 --> 00:09:55,030
can Divine Art of Shanhai be mastered.

156
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,660
How should we balance them?

157
00:09:58,460 --> 00:10:00,780
I'll transfer my inner force to you.

158
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,020
You can integrate it with yours in your body

159
00:10:02,130 --> 00:10:03,540
to master Divine Art of Shanhai.

160
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:06,590
But transferring inner force

161
00:10:06,730 --> 00:10:08,310
will damage your health.

162
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:09,580
If I have to master Divine Art of Shanhai

163
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:10,900
in this way,

164
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,870
I'd rather transfer my inner force to you.

165
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:15,340
Your inner force is too strong.

166
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:17,070
I'm afraid I can't integrate it.

167
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:19,390
Volume I is a bit strong.

168
00:10:19,620 --> 00:10:21,580
Volume II is slightly soft.

169
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:22,990
It is safer to let me

170
00:10:23,420 --> 00:10:24,780
transfer my inner force to you.

171
00:10:25,220 --> 00:10:26,900
What's more, you're a martial arts genius.

172
00:10:27,020 --> 00:10:28,340
I'm not as talented as you.

173
00:10:28,900 --> 00:10:29,510
If you transferred

174
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,820
your inner force to me forcibly,

175
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,500
I would get hurt.

176
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,270
But Hong...

177
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,180
Chong.

178
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:35,810
Don't forget

179
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:36,900
our aim this time.

180
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:39,590
Don't hesitate over trivial matters.

181
00:10:44,660 --> 00:10:45,340
All right.

182
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,980
Let’s go and transfer inner force.

183
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:49,420
Young Master.

184
00:10:56,770 --> 00:10:57,630
What's wrong?

185
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,220
I want to ask you

186
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,620
what you want for dinner.

187
00:11:00,780 --> 00:11:01,870
I'll prepare it.

188
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:04,540
Hong quit eating fish.

189
00:11:04,820 --> 00:11:06,580
As long as it's not grilled fish, any dishes will do.

190
00:11:08,020 --> 00:11:09,670
Okay. I'll go and prepare dinner.

191
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:45,060
I've figured out

192
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,670
the essence of Divine Art of Shanhai.

193
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,890
Between the two people

194
00:11:47,890 --> 00:11:48,750
who learnt from Volume I and Volume II,

195
00:11:49,020 --> 00:11:49,940
one person

196
00:11:50,260 --> 00:11:51,740
has to sacrifice himself

197
00:11:51,900 --> 00:11:53,060
and transfer all his inner force

198
00:11:53,260 --> 00:11:54,390
to the other person.

199
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:56,140
Only in this way can Divine Art of Shanhai be mastered.

200
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:56,820
Governor.

201
00:11:57,820 --> 00:11:58,860
Are you going to...

202
00:11:58,980 --> 00:12:00,420
Chong is a martial arts genius

203
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,340
It's best to let him

204
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:03,940
practice Divine Art of Shanhai.

205
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,420
Master Chong is a martial arts genius,

206
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:11,780
but you're also talented.

207
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,870
Our enemies

208
00:12:13,340 --> 00:12:15,500
are not just Fu Sou and Murong Wei.

209
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,230
There's also someone

210
00:12:16,340 --> 00:12:17,660
who is hiding in the dark.

211
00:12:17,890 --> 00:12:19,940
If I let Chong practice Divine Art of Shanhai,

212
00:12:20,210 --> 00:12:21,260
the chance of winning will be the highest.

213
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,060
In the battle in Mount Shengyue,

214
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,700
our men from the Leisure Pavilion

215
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:25,770
were all killed by Murong Wei

216
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,740
in order to protect the Murong family.

217
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:29,500
Master Chong doesn't know it

218
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:30,500
at all.

219
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,340
Hong, what are you doing?

220
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,670
Hong.

221
00:12:38,700 --> 00:12:39,580
If you exhausted your inner force,

222
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,370
you would die.

223
00:12:40,370 --> 00:12:41,460
Chong.

224
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,980
Only one person can master Divine Art of Shanhai.

225
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,050
If only one of us

226
00:12:44,050 --> 00:12:45,070
can be alive,

227
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,100
I hope that person is you.

228
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,820
I don't want Divine Art of Shanhai.

229
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:49,700
Chong.

230
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:52,190
If you insisted on stopping it at this moment,

231
00:12:52,460 --> 00:12:53,910
both of us would die.

232
00:13:04,740 --> 00:13:05,460
Hong.

233
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,580
Hong.

234
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,350
Hong, what's wrong?

235
00:13:08,730 --> 00:13:09,540
Young Master.

236
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:10,670
Help him up.

237
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:11,420
Here.

238
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,660
Master Chong.

239
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:18,100
I'm fine.

240
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,750
Save Hong first. Let's go.

241
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:27,310
What's going on?

242
00:13:28,580 --> 00:13:29,590
Governor has discovered

243
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,140
the secret of Divine Art of Shanhai long ago.

244
00:13:31,500 --> 00:13:33,620
Between the people who learnt from Volume I and Volume II,

245
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:35,510
if one person

246
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,500
is willing to sacrifice his life

247
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:38,800
and transfer all his inner force

248
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:40,260
to the other person,

249
00:13:40,890 --> 00:13:42,540
Divine Art of Shanhai can be mastered.

250
00:13:44,740 --> 00:13:46,060
Governor asked me

251
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,090
to stop you from acting on impluse

252
00:13:48,090 --> 00:13:49,350
after he die

253
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,940
and let me and the former subordinates of the Fu family

254
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:53,790
be at your disposal

255
00:13:54,020 --> 00:13:56,310
and protect you in the future.

256
00:14:09,100 --> 00:14:09,820
Take me with you.

257
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,100
It's dangerous.

258
00:14:11,940 --> 00:14:12,780
If you don't take me with you

259
00:14:12,940 --> 00:14:13,810
and leave me alone,

260
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,140
I will also be in danger.

261
00:14:15,580 --> 00:14:16,780
If you take me with you,

262
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,860
you can protect me.

263
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:23,940
If you don't take me with you,

264
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,220
then kill me.

265
00:14:25,860 --> 00:14:26,690
Anyway, if someone

266
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:28,470
found me alone,

267
00:14:28,580 --> 00:14:29,780
I would die.

268
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:31,460
I'd rather die here.

269
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,950
Let's go.

270
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,020
Let's go.

271
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,420
Who is sick?

272
00:14:46,580 --> 00:14:47,550
Why did you boil medicine?

273
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:48,740
Miss Zhuwan.

274
00:14:49,140 --> 00:14:49,870
You're back.

275
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:52,260
What happened?

276
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:54,820
It is

277
00:14:55,260 --> 00:14:56,190
a long story.

278
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:57,270
I have something to report.

279
00:14:59,380 --> 00:14:59,990
Governor.

280
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,430
We found a hidden mountain

281
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,020
near Han City.

282
00:15:03,620 --> 00:15:04,660
There is a miasma in the mountain.

283
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,580
It's very strange.

284
00:15:06,140 --> 00:15:07,170
Our men have been wandering at the bottom of the mountain

285
00:15:07,170 --> 00:15:07,980
for a long time,

286
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,030
but we failed to go up the mountain.

287
00:15:12,700 --> 00:15:13,450
Murong Chong and the others

288
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:14,580
must be on that mountain.

289
00:15:15,020 --> 00:15:15,950
Assemble people

290
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:16,860
and search the mountain immediately.

291
00:15:35,260 --> 00:15:35,660
Chase them!

292
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:41,820
Wait.

293
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:52,910
Go.

294
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:53,550
Search.

295
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:54,590
Search.

296
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:55,070
Yes.

297
00:15:55,220 --> 00:15:55,620
Yes.

298
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,790
I was really scared.

299
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:09,930
How did you know

300
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,140
there's a secret passage?

301
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,550
My feeling.

302
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:18,740
You're amazing.

303
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:39,170
I didn't expect

304
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,630
so many things to happen

305
00:16:41,010 --> 00:16:42,350
when I wasn't here.

306
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:45,910
It was all my fault.

307
00:16:46,180 --> 00:16:46,880
I didn't realize

308
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:47,820
Hong's intention earlier.

309
00:16:48,180 --> 00:16:49,100
I hurt him.

310
00:16:50,460 --> 00:16:51,750
It was not your fault.

311
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,110
You couldn't predict the future

312
00:16:54,340 --> 00:16:55,660
and stop Fu Hong in advance.

313
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,170
Hong

314
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,340
used too much inner force.

315
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,790
He's still in a coma.

316
00:17:00,580 --> 00:17:01,490
Why am I not the one

317
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,310
lying there?

318
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:04,700
Don't panic.

319
00:17:05,420 --> 00:17:06,380
Don't worry.

320
00:17:06,819 --> 00:17:08,859
Mount Jiuju is a wonderful place.

321
00:17:08,970 --> 00:17:10,540
There are many magic herbal medicine in the mountain.

322
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,190
We'll find herbal medicine tomorrow.

323
00:17:15,339 --> 00:17:16,500
After leaving Mount Shengyue,

324
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,980
you could have left.

325
00:17:19,780 --> 00:17:20,650
Why did you follow us

326
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:21,579
and get involved in it?

327
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,300
It's my own choice.

328
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,780
The Murong family is in trouble.

329
00:17:26,140 --> 00:17:27,910
I won't stand by.

330
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:30,140
From now on,

331
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,790
we'll fight together.

332
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,270
I'm sorry.

333
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,060
That happened in the past.

334
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,710
Don't worry.

335
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,010
I'll find a way

336
00:17:41,010 --> 00:17:42,380
to cure Fu Hong.

337
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,260
And you.

338
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,190
You have a hard time these days.

339
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:47,710
Take a rest.

340
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:49,250
There will be many things to face

341
00:17:49,250 --> 00:17:50,140
in the future.

342
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,260
Don't worry.

343
00:17:53,820 --> 00:17:54,850
I will protect

344
00:17:54,850 --> 00:17:55,780
you and Hong.

345
00:17:58,620 --> 00:17:59,180
Come on.

346
00:18:03,180 --> 00:18:03,740
Come on.

347
00:18:07,380 --> 00:18:08,860
Brother, I'm late.

348
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:12,270
What happened to you?

349
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:14,590
Brother.

350
00:18:15,100 --> 00:18:16,970
Brother, didn't you say

351
00:18:16,970 --> 00:18:19,230
you would protect me forever?

352
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:22,500
Brother, get up.

353
00:18:22,860 --> 00:18:23,980
Brother, get up.

354
00:18:24,810 --> 00:18:25,980
Brother.

355
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,180
Get up.

356
00:18:29,020 --> 00:18:31,020
Get up.

357
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:33,540
Talk to me.

358
00:18:34,220 --> 00:18:34,690
Brother.

359
00:18:34,690 --> 00:18:37,420
Don't leave me alone.

360
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:48,830
Young Master.

361
00:18:49,060 --> 00:18:49,670
Murong Wei

362
00:18:49,900 --> 00:18:50,310
is coming.

363
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:51,520
I didn't expect them

364
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:52,490
to come so soon.

365
00:18:52,490 --> 00:18:52,830
There are

366
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:53,470
men in black.

367
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:54,580
I couldn't get close to them.

368
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:57,370
Where did they find

369
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:58,460
so many top-notch fighters?

370
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:02,660
We sent some people to investigate

371
00:19:02,820 --> 00:19:04,190
and found that the mountain was covered in a thick blanket of fog.

372
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,670
It's very difficult to move forward.

373
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:07,350
It's easy to get lost in the mountain.

374
00:19:07,490 --> 00:19:08,540
We can't climb up the mountain.

375
00:19:09,260 --> 00:19:10,470
I wonder what the situation will be at dawn.

376
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:21,100
Master Chong.

377
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,670
How's the situation at the bottom of the mountain?

378
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,010
Fu Sou, the Jian family,

379
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,030
the Wei family and the Su family

380
00:19:25,220 --> 00:19:25,980
have gathered at the bottom of the mountain.

381
00:19:26,410 --> 00:19:27,850
How are the former subordinates of the Fu family?

382
00:19:27,850 --> 00:19:29,260
According to your instructions,

383
00:19:29,460 --> 00:19:31,270
they were deployed throughout Mount Jiuju.

384
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,260
Good.

385
00:19:48,660 --> 00:19:49,260
Miss Zhuwan.

386
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:49,990
Herbal medicine.

387
00:19:50,940 --> 00:19:51,420
Where is Zhuwan?

388
00:19:51,620 --> 00:19:52,020
She's safe.

389
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,750
She's setting traps

390
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:53,990
to buy time.

391
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:55,820
She's setting traps?

392
00:21:11,490 --> 00:21:12,420
Search carefully.

393
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:17,380
You guys, follow me.

394
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:20,990
Let's search there.

395
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:21,900
Yes.

396
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,180
Miss Zhuwan.

397
00:21:30,810 --> 00:21:32,020
How is Fu Hong now?

398
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,260
Young Master and Master Chong

399
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,670
need time to regain their inner force.

400
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:38,470
The situation is very bad.

401
00:21:38,980 --> 00:21:39,770
The traps I set

402
00:21:39,770 --> 00:21:41,060
were almost used up.

403
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:42,830
What should we do?

404
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:44,480
If we want to buy time now,

405
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:45,900
I have another way.

406
00:21:46,940 --> 00:21:47,930
But you two have to

407
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:48,750
take risks.

408
00:21:51,660 --> 00:21:52,950
We're at your disposal.

409
00:21:54,100 --> 00:21:55,030
Search carefully.

410
00:22:09,820 --> 00:22:10,260
Over there!

411
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:11,030
Chase him!

412
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:24,620
It's Meng Tang. Chase him!

413
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:25,260
Chase him!

414
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:27,390
Hurry up! Catch him!

415
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:30,700
Don't let him escape.

416
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:31,740
Hurry up!

417
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:33,100
Xi Feng.

418
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:15,310
What happened?

419
00:23:15,580 --> 00:23:16,210
He met Murong Wei

420
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,300
in the forest.

421
00:23:17,570 --> 00:23:18,490
Take care of him.

422
00:23:18,490 --> 00:23:19,170
I'm going to look for Meng Tang.

423
00:23:19,170 --> 00:23:19,620
OK.

424
00:23:21,260 --> 00:23:22,030
Are you okay?

425
00:23:28,090 --> 00:23:28,720
Be careful.

426
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:29,340
Xi Feng.

427
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:33,020
Young Master.

428
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:33,940
What happened?

429
00:23:35,100 --> 00:23:36,610
He was injured by Murong Wei.

430
00:23:36,610 --> 00:23:37,420
It's not serious.

431
00:23:37,580 --> 00:23:38,270
What about Zhuwan?

432
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:38,940
Zhuwan.

433
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,460
Zhuwan is looking for Meng Tang.

434
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:43,420
You need to recover as soon as possible.

435
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:45,020
There will be a tough fight.

436
00:23:46,460 --> 00:23:47,380
Hong is right.

437
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,970
You need to recover first.

438
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:50,060
Meng Tang and Zhuwan...

439
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:50,830
Don't worry.

440
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:52,260
Hong and I are here.

441
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:53,590
We won't let them get hurt.

442
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,270
Let me help you go inside.

443
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,140
Let me do it.

444
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:05,460
I hope Hong can regain his inner force soon.

445
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:09,110
I hope Chong can regain his inner force soon.

446
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,010
We only have half

447
00:24:11,010 --> 00:24:12,100
of our inner force now.

448
00:24:12,780 --> 00:24:13,480
I wonder how our power is

449
00:24:13,480 --> 00:24:14,500
if we fight together.

450
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:15,900
Zhuwan.

451
00:24:16,500 --> 00:24:17,550
You must be fine.

452
00:24:18,580 --> 00:24:19,260
Hong,

453
00:24:20,060 --> 00:24:21,110
you have to be fine too.

454
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,860
What should we do next?

455
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:24,070
Chong,

456
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:25,710
do you know that?

457
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:27,740
All of you are loyal followers

458
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:29,140
of the Murong family and the Fu family.

459
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:30,550
Master Murong and Young Master

460
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:31,590
are in trouble now.

461
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:32,870
Please help them

462
00:24:33,060 --> 00:24:33,780
to overcome the difficulties.

463
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:37,020
We'll follow Governor until death!

464
00:24:46,050 --> 00:24:47,660
The entrance must be nearby.

465
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:48,700
Search!

466
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:51,850
Miss Zhuwan.

467
00:24:51,850 --> 00:24:52,740
How's the situation here?

468
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:53,940
They're coming up.

469
00:24:54,380 --> 00:24:55,900
The mechanism is behind that tree.

470
00:24:56,140 --> 00:24:57,140
If someone touches it,

471
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:58,550
the red herring will disappear.

472
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,190
They will find the entrance then.

473
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:01,180
I'll distract them.

474
00:25:01,340 --> 00:25:01,780
Don't move.

475
00:25:03,660 --> 00:25:04,540
I have this.

476
00:25:08,580 --> 00:25:09,140
Don't retreat.

477
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,270
Search!

478
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:12,420
Mr. Dai.

479
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,740
How about

480
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:14,930
you take your Su family

481
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:15,860
to explore the way?

482
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:18,580
Most of our Su family have died.

483
00:25:18,940 --> 00:25:20,010
You asked us

484
00:25:20,010 --> 00:25:20,860
to explore the way?

485
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,940
What's your motive?

486
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:25,740
A group of good-for-nothings!

487
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:27,580
Get out of my way!

488
00:25:40,260 --> 00:25:40,820
Oh no.

489
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,420
They are about to find the entrance.

490
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,260
If they find the entrance,

491
00:25:45,730 --> 00:25:46,530
will they find us

492
00:25:46,530 --> 00:25:47,140
soon?

493
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:49,900
Mount Jiuju isn't that simple.

494
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:51,140
We only have

495
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,220
one way now.

496
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:54,500
Oh no.

497
00:25:54,740 --> 00:25:55,270
Run!

498
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:04,710
Governor.

499
00:26:05,220 --> 00:26:06,230
We were ambushed.

500
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,870
Our men suffered heavy casualties.

501
00:26:11,980 --> 00:26:13,660
The more we suffer

502
00:26:14,780 --> 00:26:17,180
the closer we are to the entrance.

503
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:20,380
Are you hurt?

504
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,340
I'm fine.

505
00:26:22,260 --> 00:26:22,900
What about you?

506
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:24,510
Thanks to the magic herbal medicine you brought back,

507
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:25,370
my internal injuries

508
00:26:25,370 --> 00:26:26,460
have fully recovered.

509
00:26:27,060 --> 00:26:28,580
But my inner force hasn't recovered yet.

510
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,180
How much has your inner force recovered?

511
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,230
50%.

512
00:26:31,770 --> 00:26:32,380
What about you?

513
00:26:34,540 --> 00:26:35,230
60%.

514
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,500
Now there is only one way.

515
00:26:39,460 --> 00:26:40,870
I'll transfer my inner force to you.

516
00:26:41,010 --> 00:26:41,540
No.

517
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:44,180
You have to keep your strength

518
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,670
so that you can protect yourself.

519
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,420
Given your current state,

520
00:26:47,530 --> 00:26:48,980
you can't defeat Murong Wei.

521
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,310
If you two died,

522
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,860
I, Meng Tang

523
00:26:51,980 --> 00:26:53,100
and Xi Feng

524
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,290
couldn't defeat him

525
00:26:54,290 --> 00:26:55,150
with our strength.

526
00:26:58,620 --> 00:27:00,660
I think Miss Zhuwan is right.

527
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:01,380
Enough.

528
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:02,710
Stop dawdling.

529
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:04,790
My inner force is nothing.

530
00:27:05,020 --> 00:27:06,100
My inner force can be recovered fast.

531
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:07,500
It'll be regained after I eat two bowls of rice.

532
00:27:11,020 --> 00:27:12,250
Consider it a loan.

533
00:27:12,250 --> 00:27:13,300
Remember to return it to me.

534
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:09,660
The red herring in the mountain has disappeared.

535
00:28:11,420 --> 00:28:12,470
Climb up the mountain!

536
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:03,580
Brother.

537
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,380
Are you okay?

538
00:29:06,140 --> 00:29:06,780
I'm fine.

539
00:29:09,610 --> 00:29:10,180
Zhuwan.

540
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,420
What's wrong?

541
00:29:11,820 --> 00:29:13,780
I'm fine. Don't worry about me.

542
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:15,110
Zhuwan.

543
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:18,490
You and Fu Yao

544
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:19,580
don't get involved in this.

545
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:22,510
Don't worry about me.

546
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,500
At night,

547
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,780
it is foggy in the mountain.

548
00:29:26,100 --> 00:29:27,510
If Murong Wei wants to find this place,

549
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,540
he has to wait until dawn.

550
00:29:30,060 --> 00:29:30,610
My inner force

551
00:29:30,610 --> 00:29:31,710
has almost recovered.

552
00:29:31,890 --> 00:29:33,230
I can still help you.

553
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:35,980
Xi Feng.

554
00:29:36,900 --> 00:29:37,940
Take Yao with you.

555
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,100
I'll show you the way.

556
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:41,790
Zhuwan.

557
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:45,590
Xi Feng.

558
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,270
Take them away.

559
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:47,740
Yes.

560
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,420
Meng Tang.

561
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,050
Help Xi Feng

562
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:51,000
to take them away.

563
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:51,510
Yes.
