Remember to inform my father's former subordinates.

10
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,860
I've already informed them.

11
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:44,509
Have you heard

12
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:46,009
that someone was arrested

13
00:01:46,009 --> 00:01:46,970

She is currently in East Street

What's more, you've never seen Divine Art of Shanhai.

that Chief is not that kind of person.

If he hadn't done it,

182
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:26,470
he should come out openly

183
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:28,420
and make it clear.

184
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:30,940

He's not here?

186
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:34,830
Could it be

187
00:09:35,010 --> 00:09:36,150
that he became crazy

188
00:09:36,700 --> 00:09:38,100
and hid himself?

189
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:40,380

I've already told you.

196
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,910
Chief is not in the mansion now.

197
00:10:03,420 --> 00:10:03,910
Sirs.

198
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:04,860
Sirs.

199
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:07,700
Indeed, we don't have proof

200
00:10:07,900 --> 00:10:09,220
that Chief is the murderer.

201
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:11,460
Everything is just a guess.

202
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:13,340
Let's ask Chief

203
00:10:13,500 --> 00:10:14,700
when he is back.

204
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,260
After all, Mrs Murong is a woman.

205
00:10:18,660 --> 00:10:20,140
Embarrassing Mrs Murong

206
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:21,050
will damage our reputation

207
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,820
in Jianghu.

208
00:10:23,020 --> 00:10:24,670
Am I right?

209
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:26,260
Yes.

210
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:28,100
It makes sense.

211
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:31,220
He's right, Chief Master.

212
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:33,180
Let's

213
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,340
investigate it thoroughly first.

214
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:39,660
Fine.

215
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:41,020
Please inform us

216
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:43,420
when Chief is back.

217
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,500
OK.

218
00:10:52,130 --> 00:10:52,590
Let's go.

219
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,780
Yes.

220
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,710
Let's go.

221
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:01,630
Qing Tong.

222
00:11:04,060 --> 00:11:05,140
Is there any news of Chong?

223
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:06,470
No, Madam.

224
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,420
[Fu's Mansion]

225
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:14,640
I found a body

226
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:16,420
of the Xie family which hasn't been burned.

227
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:17,860
He died in a very strange way.

228
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,420
I suspect they were killed by Divine Art of Shanhai.

229
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,910
If it had been Divine Art of Shanhai,

230
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:26,180
our guess

231
00:11:26,380 --> 00:11:27,380
should be right.

232
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:28,570
But who

233
00:11:28,570 --> 00:11:30,470
is learning from Shanhai Secret Manuals secretly?

234
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,630
This is an important matter.

235
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,700
We need to investigate it together.

236
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:40,020
The Xie family's mansion was destroyed.

237
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,290
The clues left by the murderer

238
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:42,140
are few.

239
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,580
There's no way to investigate it now.

240
00:11:43,850 --> 00:11:44,950
The most important thing for you now

241
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:47,180
is to become the governor of the city as soon as possible.

242
00:11:47,500 --> 00:11:48,770
You were ambushed on your way back.

243
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,820
It was not an accident.

244
00:11:50,700 --> 00:11:51,380
Jian'an City

245
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:53,010
is not as calm

246
00:11:53,010 --> 00:11:53,900
as it looks.

247
00:11:59,410 --> 00:12:00,110
Governor Fu.

248
00:12:00,650 --> 00:12:02,830
I didn't expect Fu Hong to survive.

249
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,070
He came back.

250
00:12:04,700 --> 00:12:06,220
What should we do?

251
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:07,380
In my opinion,

252
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:08,860
we can kill Fu Hong in secret

253
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,100
after Chief leaves here.

254
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:12,980
No.

255
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:14,860
No.

256
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,540
The late governor

257
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,590
had many loyal subordinates.

258
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:20,450
They'll certainly help Fu Hong

259
00:12:20,450 --> 00:12:21,770
to become the governor of the city.

260
00:12:21,770 --> 00:12:23,190
What should we do?

261
00:12:25,380 --> 00:12:27,030
In that case,

262
00:12:27,700 --> 00:12:28,530
let him

263
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,260
be the governor of the city.

264
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,380
The higher status people get, the more lonely they are.

265
00:12:33,850 --> 00:12:35,540
I'd like to see

266
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:39,190
how long he can be in this position.

267
00:12:48,940 --> 00:12:49,540
Hong.

268
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:51,020
Tomorrow,

269
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:53,090
you're going to be the governor of the city.

270
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:54,180
Are you ready?

271
00:12:55,580 --> 00:12:56,190
Uncle Sou.

272
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,380
My father just passed away.

273
00:12:58,820 --> 00:13:00,430
There's no need to hold a ceremony for the succession.

274
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,820
Make everything simple.

275
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:03,580
You're going to be the governor of the city.

276
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:05,470
It's supposed to be celebrated by everyone.

277
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,500
It's a big occasion in Jian'an City.

278
00:13:08,380 --> 00:13:09,580
Making everything simple

279
00:13:09,940 --> 00:13:11,460
is unfair to you.

280
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:14,270
This is a special period.

281
00:13:14,580 --> 00:13:15,620
Uncle Sou, don't worry about it.

282
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:16,940
Then I'd like

283
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:18,940
to congratulate you on the succession.

284
00:13:41,820 --> 00:13:42,700
I'm leaving

285
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,860
for Mount Shengyue tomorrow.

286
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:49,020
Have a safe journey.

287
00:13:52,140 --> 00:13:52,680
Are you willing

288
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:53,860
to go back with me?

289
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:58,300
I won't go back with you.

290
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:00,500
Are you really going to

291
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:01,900
stay here and marry Hong?

292
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:04,470
I won't marry Fu Hong.

293
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,350
But I won't go with you.

294
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:18,350
Hong.

295
00:14:18,730 --> 00:14:19,580
About your mom...

296
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:20,870
I already knew it.

297
00:14:22,180 --> 00:14:24,070
The Murong family bribed the midwife.

298
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,510
It happened in my generation.

299
00:14:26,420 --> 00:14:27,340
Logically speaking,

300
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:29,220
I shouldn't let you know.

301
00:14:29,620 --> 00:14:30,090
Now that

302
00:14:30,090 --> 00:14:31,500
you've already found out the truth,

303
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:33,420
I'll be honest then.

304
00:14:33,780 --> 00:14:34,780
Your father had found out the truth

305
00:14:34,780 --> 00:14:36,030
long ago.

306
00:14:36,740 --> 00:14:38,860
But he had been pulled rank on.

307
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:40,870
That's why

308
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,980
he treated you like this.

309
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:47,390
There's one more thing.

310
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,460
Say it.

311
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:51,390
Hong.

312
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:52,540
You must be calm

313
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:55,820
after hearing it.

314
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:00,460
Your father died

315
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:03,580
in suspicious circumstances.

316
00:15:11,420 --> 00:15:13,670
Uncle Sou, don't worry.

317
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:15,220
I'll find out the truth.

318
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,300
You just came back to Jian'an City.

319
00:15:25,540 --> 00:15:26,540
I'll find some reliable people

320
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,420
to take care of you.

321
00:15:27,740 --> 00:15:28,820
Don't bother, Uncle Sou.

322
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:30,670
Yu's son, Ting Xuan,

323
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:31,950
is my childhood friend.

324
00:15:32,340 --> 00:15:33,390
He can take care of me.

325
00:15:37,020 --> 00:15:38,990
[Guardian of Jian'an City, Ting Xuan]

326
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:37,980
Young Master.

327
00:15:38,700 --> 00:15:39,220
Lord Fu.

328
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,110
That's good.

329
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:48,770
I'm Chief now.

330
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:49,690
I can protect you.

331
00:15:49,690 --> 00:15:50,700
Trust me.

332
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,660
We can't be together.

333
00:16:02,460 --> 00:16:03,810
My father has passed away.

334
00:16:03,810 --> 00:16:05,390
You don't have to impersonate Zhuwan anymore.

335
00:16:05,660 --> 00:16:06,330
Why can't you

336
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:07,430
be with me?

337
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:13,020
Even if we're not siblings,

338
00:16:13,540 --> 00:16:14,540
you are the chief.

339
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:15,970
I'm a bludger

340
00:16:15,970 --> 00:16:17,900
who does everything for the basic needs.

341
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:19,460
If I didn't

342
00:16:19,460 --> 00:16:20,780
look like your sister,

343
00:16:21,100 --> 00:16:21,780
maybe we wouldn't have

344
00:16:21,780 --> 00:16:22,860
known each other.

345
00:16:27,300 --> 00:16:28,030
Leave here.

346
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,780
I'm living well in Fu's Mansion.

347
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,350
This place is magnificent.

348
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:36,740
Everything here is what I want.

349
00:16:38,290 --> 00:16:39,540
I won't go with you.

350
00:16:58,100 --> 00:16:59,220
Take care of yourself.

351
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:06,819
Take care.

352
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,700
Brother.

353
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,790
Brother.

354
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:18,940
You've grown up.

355
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,060
Why are you crying?

356
00:17:22,300 --> 00:17:23,819
Murong Zhuwan is a fake.

357
00:17:24,060 --> 00:17:25,460
She and Murong Chong...

358
00:17:26,060 --> 00:17:27,300
They...

359
00:17:27,300 --> 00:17:28,500
How did you know it?

360
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:33,490
I saw them

361
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,670
in the garden today.

362
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,220
I overheard them.

363
00:17:38,020 --> 00:17:39,270
Actually, I already knew it.

364
00:17:40,740 --> 00:17:41,340
Brother.

365
00:17:43,460 --> 00:17:44,950
I like Zhuwan.

366
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,330
Whether or not she is

367
00:17:46,330 --> 00:17:47,310
the daughter of the late chief,

368
00:17:48,490 --> 00:17:49,620
I like her

369
00:17:49,900 --> 00:17:51,070
not her identity.

370
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,460
Then...

371
00:17:52,660 --> 00:17:53,820
What about Chong?

372
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:56,380
Zhuwan can only be mine.

373
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:01,220
Good.

374
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:41,510
Here.

375
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:43,460
Try the shrimp.

376
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,670
Is it delicious?

377
00:18:44,940 --> 00:18:46,260
No need. I can do it myself.

378
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:48,780
You...

379
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,950
Why are your eyes swollen?

380
00:18:51,180 --> 00:18:52,340
Did you not sleep well last night?

381
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,410
How about

382
00:18:53,410 --> 00:18:54,620
I ask someone to change your room?

383
00:18:55,620 --> 00:18:56,580
Don't bother.

384
00:18:57,140 --> 00:18:58,140
I just...

385
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:00,390
I'm not used to the new bed.

386
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,270
I didn't sleep well.

387
00:19:05,220 --> 00:19:05,740
Chong,

388
00:19:06,700 --> 00:19:07,990
when are you leaving today?

389
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,060
I'll leave after breakfast.

390
00:19:11,380 --> 00:19:12,370
Yao said

391
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:13,780
she wanted to show you around Jian'an City.

392
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,860
I have many things

393
00:19:17,860 --> 00:19:18,620
to deal with.

394
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:19,820
I'm so forgetful.

395
00:19:20,530 --> 00:19:21,870
You just became the chief.

396
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:23,040
You must have many things

397
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:24,010
to deal with.

398
00:19:24,010 --> 00:19:25,190
Don't worry.

399
00:19:25,820 --> 00:19:27,380
Zhuwan lives here.

400
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,660
I'll take good care of her.

401
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:30,300
She's safe here.

402
00:19:37,140 --> 00:19:37,630
Eat.

403
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:47,780
Chief. Hong.

404
00:19:48,260 --> 00:19:48,820
Something happened.

405
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:49,900
It's said that

406
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:50,770
Chief

407
00:19:50,770 --> 00:19:51,970
has learnt from Shanhai Secret Manuals

408
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:53,180
and become a devil.

409
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:56,950
They besieged Mount Shengyue yesterday.

410
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:57,940
What?

411
00:19:58,540 --> 00:19:59,580
How's the situation now?

412
00:20:00,460 --> 00:20:01,290
What happened?

413
00:20:01,290 --> 00:20:01,750
Uncle Sou.

414
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:02,500
Chong.

415
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:03,620
Calm down.

416
00:20:03,980 --> 00:20:05,110
Let Uncle Sou tell us the details.

417
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:10,390
Mount Shengyue's Sun family has been wiped out.

418
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:11,450
An orphan of the Xie family said

419
00:20:11,450 --> 00:20:12,540
that the condition of the Sun family's bodies

420
00:20:12,660 --> 00:20:13,990
is the same as that of the Xie family's bodies.

421
00:20:14,180 --> 00:20:14,940
The way they were killed

422
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:16,620
is extremely strange and cruel.

423
00:20:17,660 --> 00:20:18,820
Only people

424
00:20:18,820 --> 00:20:19,940
who practice according to Shanhai Secret Manuals

425
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:21,140
have such power.

426
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:22,700
So everyone began to suspect

427
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,540
the Murong family.

428
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:26,060
And Chief

429
00:20:26,300 --> 00:20:27,780
is the prime suspect.

430
00:20:28,020 --> 00:20:28,940
How was that possible?

431
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,850
Murong Chong has been with us

432
00:20:30,850 --> 00:20:31,900
in Jian'an City.

433
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:32,410
When did he

434
00:20:32,410 --> 00:20:33,660
kill people in Mount Shengyue?

435
00:20:33,890 --> 00:20:34,990
That’s true.

436
00:20:35,380 --> 00:20:36,140
But

437
00:20:36,410 --> 00:20:37,020
you need

438
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,550
to explain it in person.

439
00:20:38,740 --> 00:20:39,700
I'm going.

440
00:20:39,980 --> 00:20:40,980
Let me go with you.

441
00:20:43,530 --> 00:20:44,700
I'm from the Murong family.

442
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,700
And I can testify for you.

443
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:48,830
Okay.

444
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:07,220
Zhuwan.

445
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:08,630
Fu Hong.

446
00:21:09,580 --> 00:21:11,500
The Murong family is unpredictable now.

447
00:21:11,820 --> 00:21:12,500
I can send someone

448
00:21:12,660 --> 00:21:13,820
to testify for Murong Chong.

449
00:21:14,420 --> 00:21:15,380
Don't take risks.

450
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,590
The Murong family is in trouble.

451
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:18,270
I can't ignore it.

452
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,220
What if I say

453
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:23,310
I want you to stay here for me?

454
00:21:24,180 --> 00:21:25,140
Will you agree?

455
00:21:33,260 --> 00:21:33,940
Zhuwan.

456
00:21:34,810 --> 00:21:36,580
Are you pretending not to know my feelings

457
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:38,070
or

458
00:21:39,100 --> 00:21:40,580
do you already have someone you like?

459
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:41,980
Fu Hong.

460
00:21:44,740 --> 00:21:45,290
I always see you

461
00:21:45,290 --> 00:21:46,630
as my friend.

462
00:21:46,980 --> 00:21:48,350
I don't mean to force you.

463
00:21:48,860 --> 00:21:50,140
I just want you to know

464
00:21:50,940 --> 00:21:51,950
as long as you're willing,

465
00:21:52,340 --> 00:21:53,260
I'll always be here.

466
00:21:58,820 --> 00:21:59,620
Be careful.

467
00:22:00,660 --> 00:22:01,420
I'll help you to investigate

468
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:02,940
your origin.

469
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:07,940
Thank you.

470
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,980
Go and inform Master Wei

471
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:17,280
that Murong Chong will be back soon.

472
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:17,700
Yes.

473
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:34,700
Did you really practice

474
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:35,700
Divine Art of Shanhai?

475
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:38,700
Yes, I did.

476
00:22:39,660 --> 00:22:40,340
During the drill,

477
00:22:40,340 --> 00:22:42,020
what I got in the secret place

478
00:22:42,180 --> 00:22:43,230
is Shanhai Secret Manuals.

479
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:46,180
But trust me.

480
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:47,420
I have nothing to do

481
00:22:47,740 --> 00:22:49,670
with the extermination of the Xie family and the Sun family.

482
00:22:50,020 --> 00:22:51,100
Of course I trust you.

483
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:52,030
But

484
00:22:53,820 --> 00:22:54,570
will Divine Art of Shanhai

485
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,690
backfire?

486
00:22:55,690 --> 00:22:56,540
Yes.

487
00:22:56,820 --> 00:22:57,940
But I can still suppress it.

488
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:58,780
Then...

489
00:22:59,180 --> 00:23:00,340
Mr. Yunhe is helping me.

490
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,740
You don't have to worry.

491
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:29,830
Murong Wei, stop!

492
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:38,140
Xi.

493
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:14,900
Murong Chong.

494
00:24:15,610 --> 00:24:16,310
How are you?

495
00:24:17,140 --> 00:24:18,660
Murong Wei is crazy.

496
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:20,180
I'm seriously injured.

497
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:21,140
You go first.

498
00:24:21,380 --> 00:24:21,770
Go.

499
00:24:21,770 --> 00:24:22,300
I'm not leaving.

500
00:24:45,540 --> 00:24:46,450
Xi.

501
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:46,990
Xi.

502
00:24:58,340 --> 00:24:59,590
Go!

503
00:25:00,570 --> 00:25:02,020
Go!

504
00:25:03,140 --> 00:25:03,990
Go!

505
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,860
Go!

506
00:25:08,860 --> 00:25:09,820
Xi.

♫Autumn was like a dream♫

508

I think it's a waste

526
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:13,300

Okay.

534
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,340
The late governor

535
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:46,060
left this letter to you.

536
00:26:46,620 --> 00:26:47,260
Hong.

537
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:49,910
When you read this letter,

538
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:52,540
I was already killed by the Murong family.

539
00:26:52,940 --> 00:26:54,750
When your mother was pregnant with you,

540
00:26:55,060 --> 00:26:56,220
Murong Zhu was afraid

541
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,580
that the candidate for the chief would change,

542
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:58,900
so he bribed the midwife

543
00:26:58,900 --> 00:27:00,160
into messing around

544
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,030
on the day your mother gave birth.

545
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,500
He wanted to kill both you and your mother.

546
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,070
He didn't expect you to survive.

547
00:27:06,660 --> 00:27:08,100
I had no choice

548
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,930
but to pretend to be indifferent to you

549
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:10,980
and disregard your education.

550
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:13,180
I lowered the Murong family's guard

551
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,770
and created an impression that I had no intention of training you

552
00:27:14,770 --> 00:27:16,100
to be the chief.

553
00:27:17,140 --> 00:27:18,820
But the Murong family went too far.

554
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:20,860
They asked you to go there and be a hostage.

555
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:22,310
My poor child.

556
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,900
I'm incompetent.

557
00:27:24,420 --> 00:27:25,130
Shanhai Secret Manuals

558
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,710
is in the Murong family's hands.

559
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:28,390
For the peace of the Jianghu,

560
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,780
I dare not act rashly.

561
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,380
If Hong read this letter,

562
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,620
please forgive me.

563
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:33,650
The Murong family.

564
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,780
Take back Shanhai Secret Manuals

565
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,550
and revive our family.

566
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:38,670
This is the last letter I wrote.

567
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,860
I'll take you to my master.

568
00:27:58,060 --> 00:27:58,770
She's an expert.

569
00:27:58,770 --> 00:28:00,140
She can definitely cure you.

570
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,420
Zhuwan.

571
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,170
If I died,

572
00:28:04,170 --> 00:28:05,820
would you marry Hong?

573
00:28:06,180 --> 00:28:07,510
You won't die.

574
00:28:14,620 --> 00:28:15,470
Hang in there.

575
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:18,590
We'll be there soon.

576
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:24,470
Sir.

577
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:26,100
Here are your steamed buns.

578
00:28:27,300 --> 00:28:28,470
Here. Please enjoy them.

579
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:30,260
Have you heard

580
00:28:30,500 --> 00:28:32,030
Chief killed his own sister

581
00:28:32,180 --> 00:28:33,810
in order to practice Divine Art of Shanhai?

582
00:28:33,810 --> 00:28:34,590
Chief?

583
00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,410
Murong Chong

584
00:28:35,410 --> 00:28:36,650
doesn't deserve to be Chief.

585
00:28:36,650 --> 00:28:38,300
He even killed Fu Wenhuai.

586
00:28:38,580 --> 00:28:40,740
Fu Hong was almost killed by him.

587
00:28:41,250 --> 00:28:42,460
I see.

588
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:43,730
Yes.

589
00:28:43,730 --> 00:28:44,100
Yes.

590
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:44,620
Sirs,

591
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:46,220
please keep calm.

592
00:28:47,220 --> 00:28:48,030
The Murong family

593
00:28:48,140 --> 00:28:49,510
raised such a devil.

594
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:50,900
I, Mu Rong Yu,

595
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,180
will give you an explanation.

596
00:28:53,650 --> 00:28:55,740
Murong Chong has been missing for a long time.

597
00:28:57,650 --> 00:28:59,020
Some people must be helping him.

598
00:29:01,500 --> 00:29:02,310
Who else could they be?

599
00:29:02,740 --> 00:29:03,990
They must from the Su family.

600
00:29:04,900 --> 00:29:06,620
They're all colluding

601
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:08,340
with each other.

602
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:10,310
Let's go to Murong Mansion and ask for an explanation.

603
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:10,780
Yes.

604
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:11,940
Let's ask for an explanation.

605
00:29:12,740 --> 00:29:13,300
Sirs.

606
00:29:14,020 --> 00:29:15,860
Murong Chong has practiced Divine Art of Shanhai

607
00:29:15,980 --> 00:29:16,660
and become a devil.

608
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:18,070
His power has increased substantially.

609
00:29:18,980 --> 00:29:20,020
We need more people

610
00:29:20,700 --> 00:29:22,070
to help us kill the devil.

611
00:29:22,820 --> 00:29:24,260
In order to bring peace back to Jianghu,

612
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:26,340
our Jian family will do our best.

613
00:29:29,570 --> 00:29:31,380
Our Dong family is full of masters.

614
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,900
We won't flinch.

615
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:36,620
Kill the evil and uphold justice!

616
00:29:37,740 --> 00:29:39,950
Kill the evil and uphold justice!

617
00:29:41,820 --> 00:29:42,300
Young Master.

618
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:43,980
Everything is done.

619
00:29:44,290 --> 00:29:46,180
Murong Chong's reputation has been ruined.

620
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,420
Good.

621
00:29:57,310 --> 00:30:02,860
[Beautiful House]

622
00:30:19,900 --> 00:30:20,620
Master.

623
00:30:21,700 --> 00:30:22,460
Master.

624
00:30:40,380 --> 00:30:41,110
Master.

625
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:43,340
Master.

626
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:24,060
Hong.

627
00:31:24,260 --> 00:31:26,670
Do you remember the nursery song I taught you?

628
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:31,990
Mountains are green. The sea is blue.

629
00:31:32,300 --> 00:31:36,100
I praise mountains and the sea when traveling around the world.

630
00:31:36,900 --> 00:31:40,180
Bees are busy. Horses are running.

631
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:44,750
All the disputes in Jianghu will be settled.

632
00:31:46,140 --> 00:31:46,780
Hong.

633
00:31:47,250 --> 00:31:49,980
You must remember this poem.

634
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:51,860
It will be useful in the future.

635
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:14,310
[The sky is clear. Control yin and yang to reach the top.]

636
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,750
Shanhai Secret Manuals.
