I'll tell you.

59
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:56,870
Before Her Ladyship gave birth,

60
00:03:57,060 --> 00:03:59,460
I found that the baby was too big.

61
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,030
I was afraid she might have a difficult labor.

62
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:02,530
So I ordered people

63
00:04:02,530 --> 00:04:04,270
to prepare the medicine in advance.

64
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:07,230
It was really hard for Her Ladyship to give birth.

65
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,630
After she took the medicine,

66
00:04:09,860 --> 00:04:12,330
not only did she fail to save her life,

67
00:04:12,330 --> 00:04:14,190
but also she had a hemorrhage.

68

70
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,070
then she passed away.

71
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,180
I was afraid of being blamed for the death

72

73
00:04:22,450 --> 00:04:24,070
So I wanted to run away overnight.

74
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:26,470
But I accidentally heard in the kitchen the conversation

75
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:28,050
between the maid who boiled the medicine

76
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,030

77

The man in black belonged to the Murong family.

78
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:35,120
He ordered the maid

79
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,190
to put a lot of safflower

00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,940

84
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:49,990

85
00:04:50,140 --> 00:04:52,140

Why did they harm my mother?

87

I guess

88
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,500
they were afraid that Her Ladyship

89
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,850
would give birth to a successor,

90
00:04:59,850 --> 00:05:00,850

91
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,110

92
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,460

93

00:09:02,620 --> 00:09:04,210
Express neither likes nor dislikes.

195
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:05,410
Reveal neither pleasure nor sorrow.

196
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:06,990
Expose neither happiness nor sadness.

197
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,410
This is what a man should do.

198
00:09:08,410 --> 00:09:09,140
You're too impulsive.

199
00:09:09,140 --> 00:09:09,790
Hong.

200
00:09:10,220 --> 00:09:11,330
Not that I want to be impulsive.

201
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,550
It's that she...

202
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,180
That's it.

203
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,910
I didn't draw this.

204
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:54,990
Don't look around. Just write.

205
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,990
Hong.

206
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,990
Show neither joy nor anger.

207
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,350
This is what a man should do.

208
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:06,950
Don't be too impulsive.

209
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:10,690
As a girl,

210
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:11,910
you draw such things all the time.

211
00:10:12,050 --> 00:10:13,030
It's inappropriate.

212
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:14,620
I should ask Master Sheng

213
00:10:14,620 --> 00:10:15,710
to teach you a lesson.

214
00:10:22,020 --> 00:10:24,070
Today, I promise

215
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:26,070
to stop writing

216
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:28,750
novels and drawing

217
00:10:29,020 --> 00:10:30,390
this kind of painting.

218
00:10:32,100 --> 00:10:33,870
I've written the guarantee.

219
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:38,530
[Guarantee]

220
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,990
For the sake of my stupidity since childhood,

221
00:10:38,180 --> 00:10:40,070
don't take it to heart.

222
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:45,710
Zhuwan.

223
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:46,610
You owe Chong

224
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,070
a sincere apology.

225
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:00,940
Sorry, Brother.

226
00:11:00,940 --> 00:11:02,350
I shouldn't make money with your body.

227
00:11:04,580 --> 00:11:05,270
You...

228
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,100
If Hong hadn't interceded

229
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,150
for you today,

230
00:11:13,300 --> 00:11:15,100
I will kill you.

231
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:26,970
Since you've admitted your mistake,

232
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:28,130
please return my jade pendant

233
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:29,250
and the silk bag.

234
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,050
When did I take your silk bag?

235
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:32,010
And the jade pendant.

236
00:11:32,010 --> 00:11:33,790
I deserve it for saving you.

237
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,510
What a rascal.

238
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:37,950
If you insist that I make it up to you,

239
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,240
I can give you

240
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:40,590
Murong Qing's hairpin

241
00:11:40,730 --> 00:11:42,290
or Su Yueying's fan pendant.

242
00:11:42,290 --> 00:11:43,500
Who wants those things?

243
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:45,150
You said it yourself. Forget it if you don't want them.

244
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:46,710
Unreasonable!

245
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,790
You...

246
00:11:53,700 --> 00:11:54,630
You naughty girl.

247
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:08,390
I'm here

248
00:12:08,540 --> 00:12:10,110
to give you this.

249
00:12:10,260 --> 00:12:11,910
This is gold.

250
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:14,910
I know you like this kind of things.

251
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,950
I bought it on the street.

252
00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,910
Consider it your birthday gift.

253
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:20,260
Thanks.

254
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:23,190
I'll talk to Chong.

255
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,310
OK.

256
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:39,990
Chong,

257
00:12:40,220 --> 00:12:41,370
don't be angry.

258
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,380
Zhuwan promised

259
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,380
to stop drawing.

260
00:12:43,700 --> 00:12:45,060
Don't mind her.

261
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:48,740
She took my things

262
00:12:48,740 --> 00:12:50,030
and refused to return them to me.

263
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:51,650
What're so important

264
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,470
to you?

265
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:53,550
A jade pendant

266
00:12:54,180 --> 00:12:55,120
and a silk bag.

267
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:55,940
That silk bag

268
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,820
contains my personal seal.

269
00:12:56,980 --> 00:12:58,450
If someone with ulterior motives gets it,

270
00:12:58,450 --> 00:12:59,750
there will be a big trouble.

271
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,710
Private seal is really important.

272
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,430
And that jade pendant.

273
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,670
Jade pendant?

274
00:13:06,020 --> 00:13:07,490
That jade pendant

275
00:13:07,490 --> 00:13:09,190
was a token

276
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:10,550
when we became sworn brothers.

277
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:14,190
I must get it back.

278
00:13:22,250 --> 00:13:23,150
Hong.

279
00:13:23,380 --> 00:13:24,980
Where is your jade pendant?

280
00:13:26,500 --> 00:13:27,700
It's a bumpy way to the downhill.

281
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,980
I was afraid I might break it,

282
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,430
so I left it in the academy.

283
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,230
Madam, I received a secret letter.

284
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,530
[Wei has sent someone to find the nanny and order her to testify against Zhuwan]

285
00:14:03,060 --> 00:14:04,450
Murong Wei

286
00:14:04,450 --> 00:14:05,530
asked the nanny

287
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:07,590
to testify against Zhuwan.

288
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,670
He's daydreaming.

289
00:14:15,290 --> 00:14:20,330
[Murong Mansion]

290
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,830
I brought more

291
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,140
for Master and Bao.

292
00:14:19,140 --> 00:14:19,730
You're so thoughtful.

293
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:20,670
-I've prepared for you. -Chong.

294
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,670
You must...

295
00:14:22,220 --> 00:14:23,230
Mother.

296
00:14:25,940 --> 00:14:26,780
Chong.

297
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:28,290
I've prepared tonic

298
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,790
in the carriage.

299
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,980
The poison of yours has just been detoxified.

300
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,670
You need to recuperate.

301
00:14:33,060 --> 00:14:34,270
Thank you, Mother.

302
00:14:34,420 --> 00:14:35,510
Mother, you should also

303
00:14:35,700 --> 00:14:37,270
take care of yourself at home.

304
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,440
Hong.

305
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,050
Although you are not my biological child,

306
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:44,370
you've been here since you were a kid.

307
00:14:44,370 --> 00:14:46,450
I've treated you as my own child.

308
00:14:46,450 --> 00:14:47,250
Look.

309
00:14:47,250 --> 00:14:49,090
I made this for you.

310
00:14:49,090 --> 00:14:50,470
Hope you like it.

311
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,030
Thank you, Auntie.

312
00:14:55,740 --> 00:14:57,230
I lost my mother when I was young.

313
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,380
I grew up under the protection

314
00:14:58,380 --> 00:14:59,430
of you and the Chief.

315
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,010
I can't repay you for raising me.

316
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:02,670
Please accept my bow.

317
00:15:02,980 --> 00:15:03,940
All right.

318
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,240
We're family.

319
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,630
Don't mention it.

320
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,470
Where is Zhuwan?

321
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:11,960
Mother.

322
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:13,440
Why did you mention her?

323
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,590
It's better for her to be at ease.

324
00:15:16,540 --> 00:15:18,260
She is also my daughter.

325
00:15:18,260 --> 00:15:20,190
It's just some personal talk.

326
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:24,830
Zhuwan.

327
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:26,230
Come.

328
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,150
You get in the carriage.

329
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,190
Let's talk over there.

330
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,270
Let's go.

331
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:34,790
Let's go.

332
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:40,300
Why do I feel that

333
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:41,990
you don't want to see me?

334
00:15:44,580 --> 00:15:46,310
Mother, you think too much.

335
00:15:46,940 --> 00:15:48,050
I'm going to

336
00:15:48,050 --> 00:15:49,830
leave you soon.

337
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,270
I'm sad.

338
00:15:54,140 --> 00:15:55,460
By the way, Mother,

339
00:15:55,780 --> 00:15:58,300
since they both get gifts,

340
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,330
what about me?

341
00:15:59,330 --> 00:16:00,890
You are my daughter.

342
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,820
Of course I have something for you.

343
00:16:03,820 --> 00:16:04,830
Miss.

344
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,230
I'm sure

345
00:16:09,460 --> 00:16:11,030
you'll like it.

346
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,310
Have a look after you get in the carriage.

347
00:16:17,220 --> 00:16:18,410
But

348
00:16:18,410 --> 00:16:20,470
remember who you are.

349
00:16:20,890 --> 00:16:22,270
Yes.

350
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:24,270
I will remember that, Mother.

351
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:26,230
Go ahead.

352
00:16:26,580 --> 00:16:28,990
Yes, I'll take my leave.

353
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:34,030
Xi.

354
00:16:35,820 --> 00:16:36,990
Madam.

355
00:16:37,540 --> 00:16:38,650
I have an important task

356
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:40,110
for you to complete.

357
00:16:51,860 --> 00:16:53,450
What kind of valuable thing

358
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:55,550
could this be?

359
00:17:35,620 --> 00:17:36,710
The midwife is dead.

360
00:17:46,820 --> 00:17:48,190
Why are a few eggs missing?

361
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:53,230
So are the dried grapes.

362
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,790
Could it be

363
00:17:57,140 --> 00:17:58,390
that a thief had come?

364
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,230
Master, I'm back.

365
00:18:10,340 --> 00:18:11,100
Bao.

366
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:12,690
You're here. Come here.

367
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:13,650
Help me count

368
00:18:13,650 --> 00:18:15,350
how many the dried grapes are missing.

369
00:18:28,620 --> 00:18:29,710
Shush.

370
00:18:30,500 --> 00:18:31,670
Stop eating.

371
00:18:32,500 --> 00:18:33,740
Let's go.

372
00:18:37,900 --> 00:18:39,230
Okay, I'm coming.

373
00:18:39,460 --> 00:18:40,790
Hurry up.

374
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:43,220
13.

375
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:45,010
14, 15, 16, 17,

376
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:47,270
18, 19, 20,

377
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:50,410
21, 22, 23,

378
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:53,790
24, 25, 26, 27,

379
00:18:53,940 --> 00:18:57,210
28, 29, 30.

380
00:18:57,210 --> 00:18:59,190
Adding tea clockwise

381
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:01,790
is to ask you to leave.

382
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:02,740
Oh, no!

383
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:04,220
This is bad!

384
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:05,460
Run!

385
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,550
What are you doing?

386
00:19:08,820 --> 00:19:10,590
Count it now.

387
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,980
One.

388
00:19:12,260 --> 00:19:12,990
Two.

389
00:19:13,380 --> 00:19:14,190
Three.

390
00:19:14,340 --> 00:19:14,890
Four.

391
00:19:14,890 --> 00:19:16,230
Keep your voice down.

392
00:19:17,340 --> 00:19:18,450
I almost forgot

393
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,710
how many I've counted.

394
00:19:19,860 --> 00:19:21,000
I'll keep it down.

395
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,420
Is it 40 something?

396
00:19:22,420 --> 00:19:24,630
-Five, six. -48.

397
00:19:24,900 --> 00:19:25,730
49.

398
00:19:25,730 --> 00:19:26,740
By the way, Master,

399
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:29,430
About the theories of the internal force,

400
00:19:29,580 --> 00:19:31,570
in Chapter 78, are the final words about practicing qi

401
00:19:31,570 --> 00:19:32,800
“when all is said and done”

402
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:34,150
or "when all is restored"?

403
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,510
55, 56,

404
00:19:36,820 --> 00:19:39,110
57, 58, 59.

405
00:19:39,420 --> 00:19:40,780
Master.

406
00:19:43,940 --> 00:19:44,950
What's there?

407
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,590
A bird flew by.

408
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:48,910
Haven't you seen birds before?

409
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:50,110
I have.

410
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,010
It's a mess.

411
00:19:53,010 --> 00:19:53,820
Master.

412
00:19:56,900 --> 00:19:58,750
My bad. My bad.

413
00:19:58,860 --> 00:20:00,310
Let me count for you again, Master.

414
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,990
One, two, three.

415
00:20:08,530 --> 00:20:09,470
Young Master.

416
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:17,650
The real Zhuwan is dead.

417
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,020
This one is a fake.

418
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,310
As I expected,

419
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:36,230
she's a fake.

420
00:20:41,730 --> 00:20:42,530
Why did the Murong family

421
00:20:42,530 --> 00:20:43,990
send her

422
00:20:45,020 --> 00:20:47,010
to me?

423
00:20:47,010 --> 00:20:47,870
Young Master.

424
00:20:48,340 --> 00:20:49,470
The midwife was killed

425
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:51,710
by someone who performed the Murong family's knife skills.

426
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,890
This old silk bag

427
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:17,740
and the new silk bag are made with same materials

428
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:19,630
and embroidery.

429
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:22,700
It must be made by the same person.

430
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,310
There really is something inside.

431
00:21:39,940 --> 00:21:41,730
No wonder I didn't know

432
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:42,450
what you are

433
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,690
in all these years.

434
00:21:43,690 --> 00:21:45,670
So you have a brother.

435
00:21:49,460 --> 00:21:50,550
Could it be that

436
00:21:50,980 --> 00:21:52,540
you two can reveal

437
00:21:52,540 --> 00:21:54,390
the secret of my background?

438
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:03,990
That's not right.

439
00:22:04,130 --> 00:22:06,070
Why can't them be put together?

440
00:22:06,740 --> 00:22:08,630
There seems to be one piece missing.

441
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:15,310
What exactly is this?

442
00:22:18,460 --> 00:22:19,810
Let me hear

443
00:22:19,810 --> 00:22:21,630
about your recent practice.

444
00:22:22,260 --> 00:22:23,230
Bao.

445
00:22:23,900 --> 00:22:24,750
You go first.

446
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,740
Master.

447
00:22:25,740 --> 00:22:27,220
After my hard work,

448
00:22:27,220 --> 00:22:27,860
I can

449
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:29,540
jump 3 meters high.

450
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:36,950
Fine.

451
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:38,230
Less than 2 meters.

452
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,610
You can't jump as high

453
00:22:40,610 --> 00:22:42,190
as the hens in the backyard.

454
00:22:48,940 --> 00:22:49,850
Chong.

455
00:22:49,850 --> 00:22:51,590
How's your study recently?

456
00:22:51,860 --> 00:22:54,310
Would you like to read another book to meditate?

457
00:22:54,500 --> 00:22:55,450
Master, I haven't understood

458
00:22:55,450 --> 00:22:56,630
what you mean.

459
00:22:57,090 --> 00:22:58,140
Don't worry.

460
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,890
You haven't understood it recently.

461
00:22:59,890 --> 00:23:01,270
It means it's not the right time.

462
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:03,400
Memorize the content in the book first.

463
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,670
You might need it in the future.

464
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,350
Yes, Master.

465
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,690
Your family knife skills

466
00:23:09,690 --> 00:23:11,510
is all about power.

467
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:13,890
And Chief Murong improved the knife speed

468
00:23:13,890 --> 00:23:15,470
based on the skills.

469
00:23:15,900 --> 00:23:18,700
Have you also learned

470
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,790
the essence of it?

471
00:23:23,770 --> 00:23:24,750
I'm sorry for being obtuse.

472
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:26,170
Please enlighten me.

473
00:23:26,170 --> 00:23:27,430
How about

474
00:23:27,770 --> 00:23:30,590
you take Bao and Zhuwan to practice knife skills?

475
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:32,950
They are very ordinary.

476
00:23:33,060 --> 00:23:33,900
Teaching them

477
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,540
requires patience.

478
00:23:35,990 --> 00:23:37,590
It'll be good for your meditation.

479
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:42,130
If that guy teaches me how to use knives,

480
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:43,350
he will kill me.

481
00:23:43,460 --> 00:23:44,530
No, no, no.

482
00:23:44,530 --> 00:23:45,910
Yes, Master.

483
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:47,930
I will try my best to teach Bao

484
00:23:47,930 --> 00:23:49,150
and Zhuwan.

485
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,190
Hong.

486
00:23:57,460 --> 00:23:59,150
Practicing swordsmanship is about speed.

487
00:23:59,260 --> 00:24:00,660
The Shadowless Swordplay of your Fu family

488
00:24:00,660 --> 00:24:01,850
is known as swift as the wind.

489
00:24:01,850 --> 00:24:03,070
It's rare.

490
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:05,020
Lead Bao and Zhuwan

491
00:24:05,020 --> 00:24:06,510
to practice it when you have time.

492
00:24:07,660 --> 00:24:08,910
Yes.

493
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,590
Zhuwan.

494
00:24:12,900 --> 00:24:14,340
You still need to read more books

495
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,140
about improving

496
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,070
your inner energy.

497
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:19,090
If you have some inner energy,

498
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:21,710
you can at least scare people.

499
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:22,890
Right?

500
00:24:22,890 --> 00:24:24,070
Yes, Master.

501
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,310
By the way, on the ninth day of next month,

502
00:24:28,310 --> 00:24:30,030
the school will perform survival training as routines.

503
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,820
Be mindful of it.

504
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:32,890
Bao.

505
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:35,670
Remove the weeds in the backyard in the afternoon.

506
00:24:36,490 --> 00:24:37,730
The weeds in the backyard

507
00:24:37,730 --> 00:24:39,390
are taller than you.

508
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,530
You must guard the house well.

509
00:24:42,530 --> 00:24:44,350
Be careful of the thieves.

510
00:24:44,730 --> 00:24:46,090
It sounds

511
00:24:46,090 --> 00:24:47,830
a little bit awkward.

512
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:53,230
You may leave.

513
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:54,710
Yes, Master.

514
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:02,690
Zhuwan.

515
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:04,920
Your inner energy is still weak.

516
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:05,760
How about I teach you swordsmanship

517
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:06,510
to protect yourself?

518
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:07,440
Sure.

519
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,200
But I don't have a sword.

520
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,670
I happen to have an ancient sword.

521
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,310
Hong.

522
00:25:12,770 --> 00:25:14,240
Zhuwan is a member of the Murong family.

523
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,340
It's inappropriate for her to learn the swordsmanship of your Fu family.

524
00:25:18,230 --> 00:25:19,700
Zhuwan is my future wife.

525
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:21,380
I don't think it's inappropriate

526
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,770
for her to learn our swordsmanship in advance.

527
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,240
Do you hear that, Brother?

528
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:26,800
It's appropriate for me to learn the Fu's swordsmanship.

529
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:30,070
Hong.

530
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,630
But Zhuwan and you are not married yet.

531
00:25:31,710 --> 00:25:33,520
It might not be appropriate

532
00:25:33,640 --> 00:25:34,900
for her to learnt it now.

533
00:25:38,090 --> 00:25:39,350
I was careless.

534
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:41,030
Chong, you're considerate.

535
00:25:41,620 --> 00:25:42,460
Zhuwan.

536
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:43,930
Follow Chong

537
00:25:43,930 --> 00:25:44,650
to learn the knife skills.

538
00:25:44,770 --> 00:25:46,410
I'll teach you the Fu's swordsmanship later.

539
00:25:46,410 --> 00:25:47,500
It's not too late.

540
00:25:48,050 --> 00:25:49,010
Do you hear that?

541
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:50,740
Come and learn the knife skills from me.

542
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:52,160
Don't delay Hong's practice.

543
00:25:58,210 --> 00:25:59,300
Chong.

544
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:00,860
Why are you so resistant to

545
00:26:00,860 --> 00:26:02,240
my contact with Zhuwan?

546
00:26:02,790 --> 00:26:04,050
Did you arrange for her

547
00:26:04,050 --> 00:26:05,690
to be with me or not?

548
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:10,270
This mission

549
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:12,320
can only be accomplished.

550
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:14,760
Failure is not allowed.

551
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:16,650
Otherwise,

552
00:26:17,570 --> 00:26:19,040
you'll be beheaded.

553
00:26:19,510 --> 00:26:20,470
Yes.

554
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:23,330
You split up

555
00:26:23,580 --> 00:26:25,170
and encircle separately.

556
00:26:25,680 --> 00:26:26,980
Go!

557
00:26:58,900 --> 00:26:59,950
Get up.

558
00:27:04,490 --> 00:27:05,200
Fine.

559
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:06,460
If you don't want to teach me,

560
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:07,800
I'll go to Fu Hong.

561
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:11,080
It's the same trick again.

562
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:12,420
You can only stay here.

563
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,930
You can't go out

564
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,200
or go to Fu Hong.

565
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:19,440
Cheapskate.

566
00:27:21,870 --> 00:27:22,920
What did you say?

567
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:25,360
I said...

568
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,790
Okay.

569
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,270
Don't touch that.

570
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,280
Put it down.

571
00:28:20,670 --> 00:28:21,720
Don't touch that.

572
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:26,050
You won't let me touch this

573
00:28:26,050 --> 00:28:27,430
or that.

574
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:29,410
Now you don't even let me drink water.

575
00:28:30,750 --> 00:28:32,260
Because this is my room.

576
00:28:32,930 --> 00:28:34,700
Okay, it's your room.

577
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,080
I'll go to Mr. Fu then.

578
00:28:36,250 --> 00:28:37,680
He won't dislike me anyway.

579
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:53,220
I told you

580
00:28:54,650 --> 00:28:56,030
you're not allowed to go to Fu Hong.

581
00:29:26,990 --> 00:29:27,700
This tea...

582
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,170
Is great.

583
00:29:29,590 --> 00:29:30,810
Good tea.

584
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,780
Of course.

585
00:29:33,330 --> 00:29:34,420
Have you ever tasted it before?

586
00:29:34,750 --> 00:29:35,760
I'm poor.

587
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:37,530
How could I have had such a good tea?

588
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:38,410
Where did you buy this?

589
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,750
In Jian'an City.

590
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:41,350
No wonder.

591
00:29:41,520 --> 00:29:43,620
It's bought in Jian'an City.

592
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:46,220
When I'm rich,

593
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:47,820
I'll go there too.

594
00:29:48,950 --> 00:29:51,130
Does she really have nothing to do

595
00:29:51,510 --> 00:29:53,990
with Jian'an City?
