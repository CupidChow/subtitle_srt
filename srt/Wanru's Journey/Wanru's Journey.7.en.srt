390
00:26:07,420 --> 00:26:08,540
I'm doomed.

391
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,990
Nanny.

392
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:12,900
I almost forgot. I haven't seen you for a long...

393
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,060
Master Chong,

394
00:26:15,220 --> 00:26:17,100
you must avenge

395
00:26:17,220 --> 00:26:18,460
Miss Zhuwan.

396
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:19,900
Stop pretending.

397
00:26:20,540 --> 00:26:21,140
Tell me.

398
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,300
Who sent you here?

399
00:26:24,180 --> 00:26:25,380
What's your purpose?

400
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:27,590
I am Murong Zhuwan.

401
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,020
Master Chong.

402
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:32,430
I've been serving Miss Zhuwan

403
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:34,860
ever since she was born.

404
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,700
When my husband passed away two years ago

405
00:26:37,810 --> 00:26:40,260
my family was left with the elderly and the young.

406
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,380
I had no choice but to leave miss

407
00:26:43,380 --> 00:26:44,830
and return to my hometown.

408
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:46,180
You look

409
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,540
look similar to her.

410
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:50,210
But the gaze

411
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,780
in your eyes is different.

412
00:26:52,460 --> 00:26:54,470
I can't be wrong.

413
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,300
I know.

414
00:26:58,780 --> 00:26:59,310
Ms. Zhang.

415
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:00,900
You may leave.

416
00:27:04,060 --> 00:27:05,590
You evil woman.

417
00:27:08,940 --> 00:27:10,490
Madam Murong didn't tell me

418
00:27:10,490 --> 00:27:11,910
that such a thing would happen.

419
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:12,690
Now I have to

420
00:27:12,690 --> 00:27:13,860
freestyle, don't I?

421
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:23,710
I admit

422
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,590
I'm not the real Murong Zhuwan.

423
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,740
Then tell me

424
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:28,550
who sent you here?

425
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:29,660
Your mother.

426
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:31,500
Nonsense!

427
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,460
I... I'm telling the truth.

428
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,540
You were poisoned that day.

429
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:39,970
Your mother used the real Zhuwan

430
00:27:39,970 --> 00:27:41,350
to exchange for your life.

431
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,520
Otherwise, how do you think

432
00:27:42,520 --> 00:27:43,470
your poison was cured?

433
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,980
Murong Zhuwan has been a fool since childhood,

434
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,930
but she is the most beloved child

435
00:27:57,930 --> 00:27:59,060
of the Chief.

436
00:27:59,740 --> 00:28:00,570
In order to hide

437
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,580
Zhuwan's death,

438
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:04,180
she asked me to act as her for two days.

439
00:28:07,260 --> 00:28:07,830
So

440
00:28:08,220 --> 00:28:09,620
I did this for you

441
00:28:09,740 --> 00:28:10,860
and your mother.

442
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,030
Impossible.

443
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:13,980
You're lying.

444
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:15,350
I...

445
00:28:15,700 --> 00:28:16,490
How could my mother

446
00:28:16,490 --> 00:28:17,090
do such a thing?

447
00:28:17,090 --> 00:28:18,220
I'm telling the truth.

448
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,130
If you don't believe me,

449
00:28:19,130 --> 00:28:20,100
go ask your mother.

450
00:28:20,260 --> 00:28:20,930
Your life was exchanged

451
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:22,380
using someone else's life.

452
00:28:29,140 --> 00:28:29,670
Mother.

453
00:28:30,060 --> 00:28:30,770
Zhuwan

454
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,700
must be fake.

455
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,030
Don't be fooled by her.

456
00:28:33,260 --> 00:28:35,050
Chong, don't be suspicious.

457
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,420
She is your sister,

458
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:37,670
Murong Zhuwan.

459
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:38,210
But she...

460
00:28:38,210 --> 00:28:40,390
Your father will be out soon.

461
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,380
He cared for Zhuwan since she was young.

462
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,660
You must get along with her.

463
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:55,910
Are you okay?

464
00:29:02,620 --> 00:29:03,380
You know,

465
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:05,060
don't be too upset.

466
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:06,540
It's not your fault.

467
00:29:06,700 --> 00:29:07,780
You didn't know.

468
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:12,380
That's why you should

469
00:29:12,490 --> 00:29:13,450
carry on living

470
00:29:13,450 --> 00:29:14,700
with Zhuwan's blood.

471
00:29:14,810 --> 00:29:15,780
So that she won't

472
00:29:15,780 --> 00:29:16,950
die for nothing.

473
00:29:18,220 --> 00:29:18,850
I want to know

474
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:19,710
where she was buried.

475
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:22,340
I want to pay my respects to her.

476
00:29:22,700 --> 00:29:24,260
You'll be disappointed then.

477
00:29:24,820 --> 00:29:25,860
That place exploded after it was

478
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,980
hit by thunder fire.

479
00:29:32,500 --> 00:29:33,620
She burst into flames.

480
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:35,660
So I really don't know

481
00:29:35,660 --> 00:29:36,660
where she is buried.

482
00:29:43,220 --> 00:29:44,090
I'll make sure Zhuwan

483
00:29:44,090 --> 00:29:45,180
receives a proper explanation.

484
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:47,940
Then...

485
00:29:49,300 --> 00:29:51,190
what about the nanny?

486
00:29:55,020 --> 00:29:56,100
It's not difficult

487
00:29:56,580 --> 00:29:57,910
for the Murong family

488
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:59,860
to hide someone.

489
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,540
All right.

490
00:30:06,220 --> 00:30:07,250
I have something else to deal with.

491
00:30:07,250 --> 00:30:08,060
I need to stay for a few days.

492
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:12,090
I believe Brother

493
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:13,860
will take care of these things.

494
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,660
I'll leave now.

495
00:30:34,220 --> 00:30:34,750
Mother.

496
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:36,590
How was I cured from this poison?

497
00:30:37,540 --> 00:30:39,220
It's all thanks to Mr. Yunhe.

498
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:40,700
He's been working for over a year

499
00:30:40,970 --> 00:30:42,050
and finally created

500
00:30:42,050 --> 00:30:43,380
the antidote.

501
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:45,700
Mother.

502
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,020
It's not an ordinary poison,

503
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:49,740
it's the Blood Poison.

504
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:51,860
It’s not easy to detoxify.

505
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:53,900
Tell me the truth.

506
00:30:55,460 --> 00:30:56,970
Unlike the rumors, the Blood Poison

507
00:30:56,970 --> 00:30:57,980
is not that hard to detoxify.

508
00:30:59,100 --> 00:30:59,810
You have to believe in

509
00:30:59,810 --> 00:31:01,540
Mr. Yunhe's medical skills.

510
00:31:05,180 --> 00:31:06,700
I met Zhuwan in the forbidden area.

511
00:31:06,940 --> 00:31:08,790
I've brought her home.

512
00:31:09,060 --> 00:31:11,420
She will live with us in the future.

513
00:31:12,380 --> 00:31:13,620
She has been a fool since she was young.

514
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,140
In the future,

515
00:31:15,300 --> 00:31:17,420
you should be more caring.

516
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,670
That woman

517
00:31:40,860 --> 00:31:42,300
has entered Mount Shengyue.

518
00:31:42,460 --> 00:31:43,380
Someone replied

519
00:31:43,660 --> 00:31:44,710
that

520
00:31:45,050 --> 00:31:46,940
Miss Zhuwan is a fake.

521
00:31:49,420 --> 00:31:51,100
I just want to marry the Chief's daughter.

522
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,180
I don't care

523
00:31:54,260 --> 00:31:55,190
if she's a fake.

524
00:31:56,020 --> 00:31:56,940
That woman...

525
00:32:06,660 --> 00:32:07,740
Sir, please wait.

526
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:11,860
Miss Zhuwan.

527
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:14,110
Uncle, you don't have to be so polite.

528
00:32:16,300 --> 00:32:16,900
Sir,

529
00:32:17,340 --> 00:32:19,060
you look familiar.

530
00:32:19,780 --> 00:32:21,580
You're an elder from the Murong family, right?

531
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:22,710
Come to think of it,

532
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:25,540
since I came to Murong's house at ten,

533
00:32:26,100 --> 00:32:28,630
it's been more than 40 years.

534
00:32:29,060 --> 00:32:29,870
Sir,

535
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:32,130
have you seen any relatives

536
00:32:32,130 --> 00:32:33,700
who look like me?

537
00:32:33,980 --> 00:32:34,950
For example,

538
00:32:36,260 --> 00:32:37,940
my mother's...

539
00:32:40,220 --> 00:32:41,770
I'm just a servant.

540
00:32:41,770 --> 00:32:43,990
How dare I talk about my master's family?

541
00:32:49,700 --> 00:32:50,580
I can't do that.

542
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,550
I can't.

543
00:32:53,740 --> 00:32:54,470
This...

544
00:32:54,900 --> 00:32:56,790
Let me think about it.

545
00:32:57,540 --> 00:32:59,140
There seems to be such a person.

546
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,060
Who?

547
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,700
It's a blurry memory.

548
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:06,270
Let me think.

549
00:33:09,740 --> 00:33:11,710
I can't remember.

550
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,710
I remember.

551
00:33:15,900 --> 00:33:16,660
I remember.

552
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:20,220
There is such a person.

553
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:23,710
Concubine Zhang had a younger sister.

554
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:25,940
Later, she married into the Zhou family

555
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,430
and gave birth to a daughter.

556
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:30,230
She resembles you very much.

557
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:33,550
They came to Mount Shengyue once.

558
00:33:34,260 --> 00:33:35,070
But

559
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,310
there was no news after that.

560
00:33:37,620 --> 00:33:38,090
Well,

561
00:33:38,090 --> 00:33:39,870
can we find the Zhou family now?

562
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:41,310
Well...

563
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,900
I'm afraid it's hard.

564
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,060
But...

565
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,140
But what?

566
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:49,240
There is a library

567
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,820
in this yard.

568
00:33:51,820 --> 00:33:52,670
It contains

569
00:33:52,900 --> 00:33:54,720
information on different sects

570
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,020
that Chief collected back then.

571
00:33:57,860 --> 00:33:58,660
There might be

572
00:33:58,900 --> 00:34:01,220
records of the Zhou family.

573
00:34:03,180 --> 00:34:04,780
Where is the library?

574
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:05,980
Over...

575
00:34:09,010 --> 00:34:10,020
Over there?

576
00:34:10,659 --> 00:34:11,790
No, no, no.

577
00:34:12,300 --> 00:34:12,830
No.

578
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,350
Over there.

579
00:34:17,060 --> 00:34:17,870
No.

580
00:34:20,780 --> 00:34:21,980
Where is it?

581
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,900
My brain is not working.

582
00:34:25,300 --> 00:34:25,739
It's...

583
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:29,010
I remember now.

584
00:34:29,010 --> 00:34:31,179
It's near Master Chong's bedroom.

585
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:34,139
Near his bedroom.

586
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:42,739
Murong Chong's room.

587
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,380
The library is next to it.

588
00:35:15,540 --> 00:35:16,380
Medicated cuisine?

589
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:27,820
Ginseng chicken soup.

590
00:35:30,130 --> 00:35:31,470
Is it the kitchen?

591
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,780
I can fill my stomach first.

592
00:35:46,090 --> 00:35:48,070
Ginseng chicken soup.
