00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:58,420
I must have been too nervous

It's all my fault.

I not only couldn't protect you,

is indeed as profound

168

as it is said.

169
00:09:26,780 --> 00:09:28,310
It's easy to get started,

170
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:31,140
but it's extremely hard to improve.

171
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:58,180
Even if he uses the elixir of the Fu family,

172
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,220
his injury wouldn't have

recovered so quickly.

I should have been by your side.

00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:25,500
it's not your fault.

183

Who would have thought

184
00:10:28,020 --> 00:10:29,190

185
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:37,340
I've sent Xi Feng to the bamboo forest

186
00:10:37,460 --> 00:10:38,910

187

You mean there's someone else?

That person is highly skilled in archery.

191

If he wants to kill me,

192

I may not be able to avoid it.

193
00:10:52,690 --> 00:10:53,820

00:10:54,140 --> 00:10:54,630
That's right.

195
00:10:56,250 --> 00:10:57,250
But until now,

196
00:10:57,250 --> 00:10:58,100
I still don't understand

197
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,410
why he did

198
00:10:59,410 --> 00:11:00,550
so on earth?

199
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:09,580
By the way, Hong,

200
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:11,900
I've found out

201
00:11:12,260 --> 00:11:13,180
the one trying to kill us

202
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:15,060
was from Hidden Blade.

203
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:16,910
It's another gang except Xianruo Pavilion.

204
00:11:18,980 --> 00:11:21,550
His target is not only Zhuwan,

205
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,740
but also you.

206
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:25,310
I'm sure

207
00:11:25,540 --> 00:11:26,500
the person behind this

208
00:11:27,340 --> 00:11:28,380
is Murong Wei.

209
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,300
Why did he

210
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,220
keep trying to

211
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,470
kill me and Zhuwan?

212
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,500
Because Zhuwan ruined

213
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:37,340
his plan to poison you

214
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,460
at my birthday banquet.

215
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:39,780
That's why he had to

216
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,580
kill you again

217
00:11:40,810 --> 00:11:41,700
to start a dispute

218
00:11:41,700 --> 00:11:43,150
between Mount Shenyue and Jian'an City.

219
00:11:43,900 --> 00:11:45,100
But don't worry.

220
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:47,350
I will give you justice.

221
00:11:54,770 --> 00:11:57,460
[Chief of the Martial Arts World Murong Zhu]

222
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:49,300
Welcome back, Chief.

223
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,550
[Fortune and Happiness]

224
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,860
When can I

225
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,070
find out my identity?

226
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:16,140
Will that tigress

227
00:13:16,140 --> 00:13:17,710
keep her promise?

228
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,420
And Chief

229
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,820
will be back soon.

230
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,260
He can definitely tell

231
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:28,270
I'm a fake one.

232
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:30,310
If that tigress doesn't help me,

233
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,830
I'm dying for sure.

234
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,180
Actually, you don't have to

235
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:40,190
worry about

236
00:13:40,370 --> 00:13:41,100
my father's back.

237
00:13:55,100 --> 00:13:55,990
Why are you here?

238
00:13:57,810 --> 00:14:00,390
Since my mother arranged you to meet my father,

239
00:14:00,660 --> 00:14:01,780
it means she is confident

240
00:14:02,010 --> 00:14:03,020
to keep you from being seen through.

241
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,580
Will you help me?

242
00:14:09,340 --> 00:14:09,900
Of course.

243
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,100
That's more like it.

244
00:14:14,100 --> 00:14:14,580
By the way,

245
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,740
when my father comes back,

246
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:16,780
he might mention

247
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,980
your marriage with Hong.

248
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,780
What do you think?

249
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,060
Are you really

250
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,140
going to marry Hong?

251
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,420
I...

252
00:14:27,850 --> 00:14:29,020
haven't figured it out yet.

253
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:33,020
But Mr. Fu is so excellent.

254
00:14:33,380 --> 00:14:34,250
If I miss him,

255
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:34,940
it will be hard

256
00:14:34,940 --> 00:14:36,110
to find a dreamboat

257
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:38,940
like him.

258
00:14:39,860 --> 00:14:40,220
You...

259
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:41,190
Report!

260
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:43,180
Master Chong.

261
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:43,980
Miss Zhuwan.

262
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:45,180
Master is back.

263
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:53,050
[Murong Mansion]

264
00:14:56,650 --> 00:14:58,260
I heard that

265
00:14:58,780 --> 00:14:59,450
you didn't slack off

266
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,740
when I was in seclusion.

267
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:03,940
Instead, your kills have been improved a lot.

268
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:05,660
I

269
00:15:06,340 --> 00:15:07,660
am very pleased.

270
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,020
Wan.

271
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,460
Wan.

272
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,270
Come here.

273
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:19,060
Let your father see you.

274
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,220
Greetings, Father.

275
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:31,260
Wan.

276
00:15:31,780 --> 00:15:33,140
I heard you've recovered?

277
00:15:38,060 --> 00:15:40,530
Thanks to Mother,

278
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,210
she found Mr. Yunhe to cure me.

279
00:15:42,210 --> 00:15:44,460
My condition got better.

280
00:15:45,420 --> 00:15:46,100
But

281
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:48,390
the disease hasn't been completely cured.

282
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:50,860
So it relapses sometimes.

283
00:15:51,380 --> 00:15:52,100
Wan.

284
00:15:52,460 --> 00:15:53,300
Don't worry.

285
00:15:54,260 --> 00:15:56,130
I will find you a good doctor

286
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,630
to cure you completely.

287
00:15:59,940 --> 00:16:00,890
It seems this old man

288
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:02,910
really loves Zhuwan.

289
00:16:04,620 --> 00:16:05,760
If I had a father like him,

290
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:06,740
that would be good.

291
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:08,550
Thank you, Father.

292
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:10,380
OK.

293
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:11,380
Uncle.

294
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,590
Zhuwan has been foolish since she was a child.

295
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:15,740
Even if they invited Taoist Yunhe to treat her,

296
00:16:15,980 --> 00:16:16,770
she may not recover

297
00:16:16,770 --> 00:16:17,790
so quickly.

298
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:19,670
And look at her.

299
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,940
She's smart and eloquent.

300
00:16:22,170 --> 00:16:23,270
She's like

301
00:16:23,540 --> 00:16:24,580
a different person.

302
00:16:26,820 --> 00:16:29,150
Not just that!

303
00:16:29,730 --> 00:16:31,380
She's totally a different person.

304
00:16:35,940 --> 00:16:37,900
What do you mean?

305
00:16:40,780 --> 00:16:41,420
Uncle,

306
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,700
I mean

307
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:45,340
the lowly maid

308
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,420
in front of us is not

309
00:16:46,860 --> 00:16:47,570
my cousin,

310
00:16:47,570 --> 00:16:48,940
Zhuwan.

311
00:16:52,060 --> 00:16:53,900
According to Murong Qing,

312
00:16:54,380 --> 00:16:55,360
she seems to have found

313
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,110
the evidence that I'm a fake.

314
00:17:01,860 --> 00:17:02,500
Qing,

315
00:17:03,420 --> 00:17:05,069
do you know what you're talking about?

316
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:06,460
Miss Qing,

317
00:17:06,859 --> 00:17:07,700
I'm an outsider.

318
00:17:08,099 --> 00:17:08,609
I shouldn't have got involved

319
00:17:08,609 --> 00:17:09,710
in the business of the Murong family.

320
00:17:09,940 --> 00:17:11,540
But this is a serious matter.

321
00:17:11,970 --> 00:17:12,829
Please behave yourself.

322
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,859
You're jealous

323
00:17:13,859 --> 00:17:15,099
that she is Mr. Fu's fiancée.

324
00:17:15,300 --> 00:17:16,470
That's why you're always against her.

325
00:17:16,660 --> 00:17:17,910
You almost killed her last time.

326
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:19,660
This time, you went even worse than last time.

327
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:21,069
What are you up to?

328
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:22,950
Qing,

329
00:17:24,020 --> 00:17:24,810
if you don't

330
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,660
tell me the truth,

331
00:17:27,220 --> 00:17:28,900
no matter who you are,

332
00:17:29,060 --> 00:17:31,350
I will punish you severely.

333
00:17:32,180 --> 00:17:32,740
Qing,

334
00:17:34,860 --> 00:17:36,630
are you not feeling well,

335
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,280
[Chief Master of Mount Shengyue Murong Yu]

336
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,820
so you're talking nonsense here?

337
00:17:39,140 --> 00:17:40,100
Apologize to your uncle

338
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:41,140
and Zhuwan.

339
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:42,310
Father.

340
00:17:42,650 --> 00:17:43,620
I'm fine.

341
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,030
I'm not talking nonsense.

342
00:17:45,220 --> 00:17:46,070
I have evidence.

343
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,500
Uncle,

344
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:52,590
I received a secret letter.

345
00:17:52,940 --> 00:17:53,900
The letter said

346
00:17:54,060 --> 00:17:55,750
this Zhuwan is an imposter.

347
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:56,940
The real Zhuwan

348
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:57,940
was murdered by her

349
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:58,940
and buried in the back mountain.

350
00:17:59,540 --> 00:18:01,140
So I sent someone to the back mountain,

351
00:18:01,330 --> 00:18:02,900
and found a gravestone without a tomb there.

352
00:18:03,140 --> 00:18:04,010
And my cousin,

353
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:05,150
Zhuwan's body was also found.

354
00:18:06,780 --> 00:18:08,310
To clear my cousin's name

355
00:18:08,490 --> 00:18:09,860
and correct the bloodline for Murong family,

356
00:18:10,220 --> 00:18:11,060
I had no choice

357
00:18:11,060 --> 00:18:12,310
but to stand out

358
00:18:12,490 --> 00:18:13,590
and tell the truth.

359
00:18:14,620 --> 00:18:15,940
Please forgive me, Uncle.

360
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,110
Is it true?

361
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:22,700
Yes.

362
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:50,220
I also asked them

363
00:18:50,220 --> 00:18:52,230
to take the coffin of the real Zhuwan.

364
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:54,300
If we open the coffin and examine the body,

365
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,820
we'll identify know the truth.

366
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:04,300
Since you've found the coffin,

367
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,460
I'd like to see

368
00:19:06,820 --> 00:19:08,580
who's inside.

369
00:19:32,020 --> 00:19:32,590
Brother.

370
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:35,350
The corpse's face was destroyed.

371
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:37,190
Someone did it on purpose.

372
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:38,940
I'm afraid

373
00:19:40,260 --> 00:19:42,070
there's something fishy.

374
00:19:52,540 --> 00:19:53,860
Zhuwan's corpse

375
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:55,710
was ruined by Thunder Ball,

376
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:58,500
and was buried in the woods behind the mountain.

377
00:19:59,060 --> 00:19:59,740
Don't look for it.

378
00:20:03,010 --> 00:20:04,380
Zhuwan's corpse was ruined.

379
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,300
This must be a trap.

380
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:08,180
Hong.

381
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:09,260
It must be

382
00:20:09,260 --> 00:20:10,190
a trap they set.

383
00:20:10,420 --> 00:20:11,540
Don't believe it.

384
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:13,420
Let's wait and see,

385
00:20:13,730 --> 00:20:15,270
and see what they are up to.

386
00:20:24,420 --> 00:20:24,860
Father.

387
00:20:26,180 --> 00:20:27,340
The figure of this corpse

388
00:20:27,460 --> 00:20:28,780
does resemble Zhuwan's.

389
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:30,420
And her face was ruined

390
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:32,620
and was buried in such a hidden way.

391
00:20:33,420 --> 00:20:34,420
Someone must be

392
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,740
hiding something.

393
00:20:44,810 --> 00:20:45,620
Master.

394
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:48,030
During your seclusion,

395
00:20:48,420 --> 00:20:50,900
I've treated Zhuwan well.

396
00:20:51,300 --> 00:20:51,860
If something

397
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,380
happened to her,

398
00:20:53,540 --> 00:20:54,350
I...

399
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:57,140
would be too shameful to face you.

400
00:20:58,140 --> 00:20:58,750
Master,

401
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,340
you must investigate it carefully,

402
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:02,380
and clear Zhuwan's and my name.

403
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:03,500
Please.

404
00:21:14,180 --> 00:21:15,900
My dear mother.

405
00:21:17,380 --> 00:21:18,780
If you see this in heaven,

406
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,500
please don't blame my father.

407
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:22,220
Wan,

408
00:21:22,380 --> 00:21:24,260
your life is so miserable.

409
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,700
Mother.

410
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,900
Wan.

411
00:21:31,380 --> 00:21:31,860
Alright.

412
00:21:32,580 --> 00:21:33,540
I know what to do.

413
00:21:36,660 --> 00:21:37,500
Uncle,

414
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,940
the coroner has examined it.

415
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,140
This body belongs to Zhuwan.

416
00:21:41,420 --> 00:21:42,220
Why aren't you willing to

417
00:21:42,220 --> 00:21:43,340
believe the truth?

418
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:44,950
This lowly maid

419
00:21:45,060 --> 00:21:46,070
killed Zhuwan.

420
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:47,950
Even Aunt was deceived by her.

421
00:21:48,290 --> 00:21:50,250
The coroner can only identify

422
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:51,640
the body's height, age,

423
00:21:51,640 --> 00:21:52,620
gender and cause of death.

424
00:21:53,420 --> 00:21:54,340
I've never heard that

425
00:21:54,340 --> 00:21:55,620
they could test the bloodline.

426
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:56,900
Qing,

427
00:21:57,860 --> 00:21:58,860
tell me.

428
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:01,550
How can you prove

429
00:22:02,140 --> 00:22:02,980
that this corpse

430
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:04,710
belongs to Murong family?

431
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:06,430
How can you be sure

432
00:22:06,540 --> 00:22:07,740
that she is Zhuwan?

433
00:22:08,460 --> 00:22:08,820
I...

434
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:11,500
Uncle.

435
00:22:12,010 --> 00:22:13,410
Chong must have been blinded

436
00:22:13,410 --> 00:22:14,460
by this lowly maid.

437
00:22:14,970 --> 00:22:15,650
That's why

438
00:22:15,650 --> 00:22:16,750
he wouldn't believe the truth.

439
00:22:17,820 --> 00:22:18,940
Then tell us

440
00:22:18,940 --> 00:22:20,140
what the truth is.

441
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,590
How did you think of

442
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,530
proving your cousin fake

443
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:25,780
with a ruined

444
00:22:25,780 --> 00:22:26,550
corpse?

445
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,620
Will you prove

446
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:35,860
that I'm fake one day?

447
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:36,740
-Enough. -I...

448
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,650
I won't

449
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:39,830
mistake my own daughter.

450
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:43,020
This corpse doesn't belong to Wan.

451
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,740
Please leave everyone.

452
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,350
Our family

453
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,500
will have a gathering.

454
00:22:49,010 --> 00:22:49,950
Uncle.

455
00:22:58,050 --> 00:23:02,000
[Gathering of Auspiciousness]

456
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,380
Let's enjoy the meal.

457
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:04,790
Here.

458
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:06,710
Here, Wan.

459
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:08,330
I remember you like shrimps

460
00:23:08,330 --> 00:23:09,980
the most since childhood.

461
00:23:10,860 --> 00:23:11,580
Have more.

462
00:23:14,780 --> 00:23:15,950
Thank you, Father.

463
00:23:16,530 --> 00:23:17,900
Don't mention it.

464
00:23:21,060 --> 00:23:22,540
Don't mind what happened outside

465
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:23,900
just now.

466
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,200
No matter what others say about you,

467
00:23:26,200 --> 00:23:27,780
I trust you the most.

468
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,260
Don't bother with Qing

469
00:23:29,540 --> 00:23:30,980
about this anymore.

470
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:32,130
This kid

471
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,230
is not very smart.

472
00:23:33,460 --> 00:23:34,100
From now on,

473
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:35,420
hang out less with her.

474
00:23:37,500 --> 00:23:38,180
Let's dig in.

475
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:40,790
Wan.

476
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:41,460
Eat more.

477
00:23:41,580 --> 00:23:41,960
Here.

478
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:42,580
Hong, have more.

479
00:23:43,650 --> 00:23:44,140
Okay.

480
00:23:45,260 --> 00:23:45,740
Here.

481
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:47,780
Dear.

482
00:23:48,690 --> 00:23:50,210
Wan

483
00:23:50,210 --> 00:23:51,580
has almost recovered.

484
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:53,260
She's old enough to get married.

485
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,630
When should we

486
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,940
get their marriage

487
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:56,950
settled?

488
00:24:02,860 --> 00:24:03,540
Master.

489
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,750
Although Wan is fine now,

490
00:24:05,940 --> 00:24:07,340
she hasn't fully recovered.

491
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,550
If we let her get married now,

492
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:11,210
even though Hong and Lord Fu

493
00:24:11,210 --> 00:24:12,270
wouldn't say anything,

494
00:24:12,650 --> 00:24:14,100
others will say

495
00:24:14,260 --> 00:24:16,070
we don't like this sick girl

496
00:24:16,260 --> 00:24:17,950
so we want her to get married.

497
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:19,980
Master,

498
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:21,460
you often go in seclusion.

499
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,660
Wan can't be with you.

500
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:24,670
Look.

501
00:24:25,060 --> 00:24:26,460
She's getting better now.

502
00:24:26,660 --> 00:24:28,270
She's smart now.

503
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:29,980
I mean

504
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,740
you two

505
00:24:31,940 --> 00:24:34,020
should spend more time with each other.

506
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:37,020
Dear, don't get me wrong.

507
00:24:39,060 --> 00:24:39,770
I'm not saying

508
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:41,620
to let Wan marry soon.

509
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,660
I always think

510
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,580
this is unfair

511
00:24:45,700 --> 00:24:46,990
to Hong.

512
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,190
Uncle, Auntie.

513
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:49,910
Although the engagement between Zhuwan and me

514
00:24:50,100 --> 00:24:51,260
is set when I was little,

515
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:52,980
I've never taken it as a child's play.

516
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,260
But Zhuwan is still young.

517
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:56,290
It's OK to let her

518
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,780
spend two more years with you.

519
00:24:58,580 --> 00:24:59,380
During this period,

520
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:01,270
I can cultivate my mind

521
00:25:01,860 --> 00:25:02,370
so that I can

522
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,500
provide Zhuwan a better life in the future.

523
00:25:04,330 --> 00:25:05,100
Look.

524
00:25:05,380 --> 00:25:07,260
Hong is indeed sensible.

525
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:08,860
Not to mention Wan

526
00:25:09,060 --> 00:25:10,510
only marries him two years late,

527
00:25:10,780 --> 00:25:12,350
even if it's three or five years late,

528
00:25:12,620 --> 00:25:13,290
Hong

529
00:25:13,290 --> 00:25:15,140
is still our good son-in-law.

530
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,300
Hong is right.

531
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,980
In that case,

532
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:21,540
I'll let Wan stay with me

533
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:22,780
for two more years.

534
00:25:24,380 --> 00:25:24,790
Let's have a drink.

535
00:25:24,980 --> 00:25:26,700
Cheers.

536
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,290
Cheers.

537
00:25:28,290 --> 00:25:28,750
Cheers.

538
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:43,780
Mother.

539
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:45,620
The banquet just ended.

540
00:25:45,940 --> 00:25:47,430
Is there anything I can do for you?

541
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,660
Chong,

542
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:50,130
you are

543
00:25:50,130 --> 00:25:51,580
more mature now.

544
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:53,660
I'm very pleased.

545
00:25:54,460 --> 00:25:57,150
You should know that army can't be governed by mercy.

546
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,260
Righteousness does not bring wealth.

547
00:25:58,500 --> 00:25:59,830
Love can't help with work.

548
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:01,220
Now you...

549
00:26:01,580 --> 00:26:02,060
Wait a sec.

550
00:26:02,530 --> 00:26:03,190
Mother.

551
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,350
You're making me more confused.

552
00:26:06,500 --> 00:26:07,490
If you didn't

553
00:26:07,490 --> 00:26:08,980
kill Zhang,

554
00:26:09,180 --> 00:26:10,730
there would have been

555
00:26:10,730 --> 00:26:12,140
a lot of trouble today.

556
00:26:12,660 --> 00:26:14,620
I didn't know

557
00:26:15,100 --> 00:26:17,370
that silly Murong Qing...

558
00:26:17,370 --> 00:26:17,780
Wait.

559
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:19,230
Mother.

560
00:26:20,180 --> 00:26:20,940
Didn't you

561
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:22,990
kill Zhang?

562
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,070
I wanted to,

563
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,860
but before my action,

564
00:26:28,060 --> 00:26:29,910
I got the news of her death.

565
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,870
I thought it was you.

566
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:37,300
Who killed Zhang then?

567
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:48,390
Hong.

568
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:51,790
You have something for me?

569
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,420
I already know

570
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,420
Zhuwan's identity.

571
00:27:02,260 --> 00:27:03,140
You already knew

572
00:27:03,140 --> 00:27:04,350
Zhuwan is a fake?

573
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:05,660
Of course.

574
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:08,350
Hong,

575
00:27:08,660 --> 00:27:09,630
don't blame me.

576
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:10,650
This is an important matter.

577
00:27:10,650 --> 00:27:11,420
I didn't tell you

578
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:12,940
because I don't want to put you in danger.

579
00:27:13,700 --> 00:27:14,180
Chong,

580
00:27:14,460 --> 00:27:15,110
I don't blame you.

581
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:16,550
You have your own reasons

582
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,230
to choose tell me or not.

583
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:21,620
Hong,

584
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:23,180
since you've known

585
00:27:23,580 --> 00:27:24,750
Zhuwan is fake,

586
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:26,470
your marriage

587
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,620
won't count, right?

588
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,350
I'll tell Father on your behalf.

589
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:31,270
Although she is fake,

590
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,680
our engagement

591
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:33,460
does still count.

592
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,620
Hong.

593
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:38,140
She is an unknown wild girl.

594
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:39,010
You are the future

595
00:27:39,010 --> 00:27:40,140
City Governor of Jian'an.

596
00:27:40,420 --> 00:27:41,420
It will be inappropriate.

597
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,320
Then you are

598
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:43,700
the future Chief of the Martial Arts World.

599
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,020
You also take good care of her.

600
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:46,770
And if

601
00:27:46,770 --> 00:27:48,070
I and Zhuwan are together,

602
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,210
others won't know

603
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,190
her fake identity.

604
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:51,330
It will be good

605
00:27:51,330 --> 00:27:52,540
for the Murong family.

606
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:53,820
You're right.

607
00:28:01,920 --> 00:28:08,010
[Murong Mansion]

608
00:28:27,260 --> 00:28:27,900
Wan,

609
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,230
what martial arts are you practicing?

610
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:32,830
Father.

611
00:28:33,300 --> 00:28:33,740
I...

612
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,990
I'm just doing the morning exercise.

613
00:28:37,900 --> 00:28:38,620
Okay.

614
00:28:38,740 --> 00:28:39,580
Come here.

615
00:28:44,900 --> 00:28:46,220
You haven't had breakfast, have you?

616
00:28:47,260 --> 00:28:48,090
I brought you

617
00:28:48,090 --> 00:28:49,900
your favorite cake.

618
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:52,820
This is expensive!

619
00:28:53,140 --> 00:28:53,580
Father.

620
00:29:01,060 --> 00:29:01,940
Yummy.

621
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,110
Really?

622
00:29:03,700 --> 00:29:04,750
Eat more then.

623
00:29:06,260 --> 00:29:06,740
Father.

624
00:29:07,220 --> 00:29:08,220
Come and have a seat.

625
00:29:08,660 --> 00:29:09,300
Okay.

626
00:29:09,420 --> 00:29:09,790
Okay.

627
00:29:16,660 --> 00:29:17,700
Eat slowly.

628
00:29:18,420 --> 00:29:18,830
Have more.

629
00:29:19,010 --> 00:29:20,380
I'm not eating. You eat first.

630
00:29:24,250 --> 00:29:24,950
Wan.

631
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,670
How is your illness?

632
00:29:29,340 --> 00:29:31,140
I feel much better now.

633
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:32,580
Look at me.

634
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:35,630
Silly girl.

635
00:29:36,660 --> 00:29:37,460
Don't worry.

636
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:39,470
I've found a good doctor for you

637
00:29:39,980 --> 00:29:41,860
to cure you completely.

638
00:29:42,820 --> 00:29:43,540
Thank you, Father.

639
00:29:45,780 --> 00:29:48,290
How is your relationship

640
00:29:48,290 --> 00:29:49,140
with Mr. Fu?

641
00:29:49,900 --> 00:29:51,500
Mr. Fu is very nice

642
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:52,250
and gentle.

643
00:29:52,250 --> 00:29:53,340
He treats me well.

644
00:29:55,570 --> 00:29:56,740
Did you quarrel before?

645
00:29:59,770 --> 00:30:00,380
Father.

646
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:03,190
Let's talk about those things later.

647
00:30:04,060 --> 00:30:05,270
Are you shy,

648
00:30:05,380 --> 00:30:06,380
my girl?

649
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,070
How are you doing in the academy?

650
00:30:13,780 --> 00:30:15,020
It's fun in the academy.

651
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,540
I also make good friends there.

652
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,460
The meals are good too.

653
00:30:20,020 --> 00:30:21,100
Did your master

654
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,710
teach you martial arts?

655
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,380
No.

656
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:28,140
But Master always asked me to sunbathe.

657
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,650
Maybe it's because of the photosynthesis.

658
00:30:29,650 --> 00:30:30,950
She wants me to grow taller.

659
00:30:40,260 --> 00:30:40,860
Wan,

660
00:30:41,500 --> 00:30:43,310
have you heard of

661
00:30:43,900 --> 00:30:45,300
the Shanhai Secret Manual?

662
00:30:45,540 --> 00:30:46,270
Yes.

663
00:30:46,660 --> 00:30:47,890
I heard that only the Chief of the Martial Arts World

664
00:30:47,890 --> 00:30:49,190
can learn it.

665
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:51,140
Not necessarily.

666
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,140
As long as you are talented,

667
00:30:54,860 --> 00:30:56,060
you can still practice it.

668
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:57,630
Really?

669
00:30:58,580 --> 00:30:59,710
Can I practice it too?
