[Episode 13]

4
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,300
I'm getting changed.

5
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:41,820
Why did you come in without knocking?

6
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:42,340
Then I...

7
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:46,460
What are you doing?

8
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:47,410
In your heart,

9
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:49,289
am I only

10
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,539
an insignificant person?

11
00:01:51,700 --> 00:01:52,740
What are you talking about?

12
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:53,539
Tell me.

13
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:56,820
How do you feel about me?

14
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:58,330
Stop evading the issue.

15
00:01:59,180 --> 00:01:59,860
I want to know

16
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:01,020
your true thoughts.

17
00:02:01,490 --> 00:02:03,060
What are you talking about?

18
00:02:03,380 --> 00:02:04,300
Let go of me!

19
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,260
Your acting

20
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,220
is forced and

21
00:02:06,380 --> 00:02:07,140
outdated.

22
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:08,620
Then why did you kiss me last night?

23
00:02:11,140 --> 00:02:13,340
I was drunk.

24
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,820
If you really mind,

25
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:15,660
I apologize.

26
00:02:15,820 --> 00:02:17,380
I don't need your apology.

27
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:18,780
I don't like it when

28
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:19,980
you push me to someone else.

29
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:22,620
I just want you.

30
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:36,140
Why are you stopping me?

31
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,260
I want to see Chong.

32
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:38,820
Outsiders are not allowed to enter.

33
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:40,620
Outsider?

34
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,500
You call me an outsider?

35
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,260
I am...

36
00:02:45,820 --> 00:02:49,220
I'm his sister-in-law.

37
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,579
Family.

38
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,100
Family.

39
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:54,220
Family.

40
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:55,500
Family.

41
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:01,170
Don't you

42
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,700
understand me?

43
00:03:02,980 --> 00:03:03,860
I'm not an outsider.

44
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,170
I want to see Chong.

45
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:16,860
I've never seen

46
00:03:16,980 --> 00:03:17,900
such a stubborn log like you.

47
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:18,940
Fine.

48
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:21,540
Chong.

49
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,850
I'm your Yaoyao,

50
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:27,820
I'm going home now.

51
00:03:28,100 --> 00:03:30,660
I'll visit you when I'm free.

52
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,740
I'll be back.

53
00:03:51,020 --> 00:03:52,620
I don't know since when

54
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:55,540
your image would appear

55
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:56,540
in front of me.

56
00:03:58,130 --> 00:03:58,860
Your voice

57
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:01,380
can be heard in my ears.

58
00:04:01,820 --> 00:04:03,140
But we can't be together.

59
00:04:03,620 --> 00:04:04,010
We...

60
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:09,260
♫Autumn was like a dream♫

61
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:16,230
♫We drank under the star-blanketed sky♫

62
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:19,019
♫The past is all a blur now♫

63
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:27,010
♫Flowers bloom and wither, then bloom again♫

64
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:32,840
♫It's love at first sight♫

65
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:39,010
♫I keep wondering when we'll meet again♫

66
00:04:39,290 --> 00:04:42,880
♫You painted my sky colorful♫

67
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,490
♫I don't know how to put my feelings into words♫

68
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:52,610
♫Just bring more wine and live in the moment♫

69
00:04:56,540 --> 00:04:57,020
No.

70
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,140
No.

71
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:00,940
We can't be together.

72
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:02,740
Why?

73
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:04,220
Now the whole world knows

74
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,500
I'm your sister,

75
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:07,220
Fu Hong is my fiance.

76
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,460
I can't forget my role.

77
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:11,460
I'll go tomorrow

78
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:13,180
to tell my father the truth

79
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,610
and let you live

80
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,180
as yourself.

81
00:05:16,540 --> 00:05:17,060
By then,

82
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:19,420
I will marry you

83
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,100
in a grand manner.

84
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:21,900
Murong Chong.

85
00:05:22,860 --> 00:05:24,020
Don't be silly.

86
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:26,340
When my identity is exposed,

87
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,740
it'll be the day that I leave.

88
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,340
Leave?

89
00:05:31,700 --> 00:05:32,690
Do you think my mother and brother

90
00:05:32,780 --> 00:05:33,780
would let you leave?

91
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:39,260
Zhuwan.

92
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:42,460
If you want a peaceful life,

93
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:45,060
then stay with me.

94
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:48,250
I'll protect you.

95
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:51,610
Murong Chong,

96
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,540
thank you for your concern.

97
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,340
But we really

98
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,540
can't be together.

99
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,050
Don't say these things

100
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:02,020
to me anymore.

101
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:03,700
Master Chong.

102
00:06:08,610 --> 00:06:09,250
Master Chong.

103
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:11,740
Master wants you to go to the study.

104
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:14,540
Got it.

105
00:06:18,540 --> 00:06:19,140
I'll be right there.

106
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:38,890
Father.

107
00:06:39,580 --> 00:06:40,220
Chong.

108
00:06:43,580 --> 00:06:45,100
Sit down.

109
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:49,140
Chief.

110
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:50,420
Xie Ming.

111
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:50,980
Chief.

112
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:52,130
What happened?

113
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,060
Ming.

114
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,780
Take it easy.

115
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,180
The entire Xie family, a total of

116
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,220
76 people.

117
00:06:59,980 --> 00:07:00,820
Besides me,

118
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:05,060
everyone was killed.

119
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:11,020
What did you say?

120
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:12,460
The Xie family?

121
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:14,780
The Xie family was wiped out.

122
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:19,180
How could such a tragedy happen?

123
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:22,540
Did the Xie family offend anyone?

124
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:25,130
My uncle was upright and kind.

125
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:26,700
He has never offended anyone.

126
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,260
Even if he offended someone,

127
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,060
it's not serious enough to have his family wiped out.

128
00:07:30,980 --> 00:07:32,620
I just got home tonight.

129
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:35,180
If Uncle hadn't

130
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:37,140
hid me in the water tank,

131
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,210
I would have

132
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:41,620
been killed by that demon.

133
00:07:44,140 --> 00:07:45,540
Did you see his face?

134
00:07:53,060 --> 00:07:53,740
I didn't see

135
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,860
the devil's face.

136
00:07:56,180 --> 00:07:57,780
His face was covered by his hair.

137
00:07:59,420 --> 00:08:01,740
His way of killing is eerie

138
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,900
and cruel.

139
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:07,780
Ridiculous!

140
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:11,220
That demon dared to commit such a crime.

141
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:14,140
It means that he has no regard for

142
00:08:14,180 --> 00:08:16,220
the martial arts world at all.

143
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,220
This is not only

144
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:22,220
your family's problem.

145
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:25,820
If we don't get rid of the demon as soon as possible,

146
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:27,180
there will be

147
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,340
a bloody storm.

148
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:31,460
I'll gather the heroes

149
00:08:31,620 --> 00:08:33,179
to arrest the murderer

150
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:35,380
and avenge the Xie family.

151
00:08:38,460 --> 00:08:38,820
Father!

152
00:08:40,299 --> 00:08:40,700
Father.

153
00:08:50,340 --> 00:08:50,940
Don't worry.

154
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:54,260
I was just impatient.

155
00:08:57,780 --> 00:08:58,660
Don't worry, Ming.

156
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:00,460
We will help you catch the murderer

157
00:09:00,900 --> 00:09:01,900
and give you justice.

158
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:06,380
Sister-in-law,

159
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:07,700
you're amazing.

160
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:09,130
How did you do it?

161
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,300
Teach me. Teach me.

162
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:11,540
It's nothing. I'll teach you later.

163
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,140
Yaoyao.

164
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:13,940
Brother.

165
00:09:15,020 --> 00:09:15,420
Brother!

166
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:17,500
Brother.

167
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,900
I finally meet you.

168
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:20,860
You're more handsome than before.

169
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,660
It's been a while,

170
00:09:23,340 --> 00:09:24,140
you've gotten better at

171
00:09:24,260 --> 00:09:24,980
sweet-talking.

172
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:26,900
Miss.

173
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:28,660
Meng Tang,

174
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:29,860
you've also become more handsome.

175
00:09:30,220 --> 00:09:31,820
Your taste has also improved.

176
00:09:32,180 --> 00:09:32,980
I didn't expect

177
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:34,060
you have

178
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,420
such a cutesy sister.

179
00:09:36,620 --> 00:09:38,180
What does cutesy mean?

180
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:40,820
It means

181
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:42,700
she is super cute.

182
00:09:45,140 --> 00:09:46,220
It's dangerous outside now

183
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:47,900
and you sneaked out of home.

184
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:49,780
Do you know how anxious I was

185
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,700
when you disappeared?

186
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:51,620
Luckily you met

187
00:09:51,660 --> 00:09:52,540
Zhuwan and Chong.

188
00:09:52,940 --> 00:09:54,420
Otherwise, the consequences would be unimaginable.

189
00:09:56,260 --> 00:09:57,420
That's because

190
00:09:57,620 --> 00:09:58,620
you never go home.

191
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:00,100
I miss you.

192
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,580
All right.

193
00:10:02,340 --> 00:10:03,340
Don't blame her.

194
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,460
Your sister cares about you so much,

195
00:10:05,700 --> 00:10:06,500
you should count your blessings.

196
00:10:08,060 --> 00:10:09,300
You are the best.

197
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,300
The massacre of the Xie family

198
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,540
is a serious case.

199
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:17,220
We will

200
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,260
never allow that demon

201
00:10:19,380 --> 00:10:20,370
to kill at will.

202
00:10:21,650 --> 00:10:24,420
We must arrest that demon

203
00:10:25,580 --> 00:10:27,380
to give the Xie family an explanation.

204
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:28,740
Chief,

205
00:10:29,010 --> 00:10:29,980
there's no time to lose.

206
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:32,180
Let's go to Xiangzhou to investigate now.

207
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,220
That's what I'm thinking.

208
00:10:36,580 --> 00:10:37,700
Letting that scum

209
00:10:37,820 --> 00:10:39,300
live for one more day,

210
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:41,980
means one more day of danger for the world.

211
00:10:44,130 --> 00:10:44,380
Chief.

212
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:44,860
Father.

213
00:10:45,340 --> 00:10:45,660
Father!

214
00:10:46,010 --> 00:10:46,700
Father, what's wrong?

215
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:49,780
Father, I'll get a doctor.

216
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:53,020
No need.

217
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:55,580
Father.

218
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:56,820
If you don't feel well,

219
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:57,980
don't go to Xiangzhou.

220
00:10:58,380 --> 00:10:59,250
Let me go in your place.

221
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:00,940
It's okay.

222
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:02,940
Brother.

223
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:04,500
You'd better stay home

224
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:05,860
and wait for our news.

225
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:08,500
Yes, Chief.

226
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:10,060
You can stay at home.

227
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,650
If there are any news,

228
00:11:12,020 --> 00:11:14,180
we can also act in accordance.

229
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:15,780
Yes, Father.

230
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:20,220
Chief,

231
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:21,970
you must take care of yourself.

232
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:23,850
With Master Chong

233
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:25,700
and so many

234
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,010
uncles and masters here,

235
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,660
we’ll definitely find some clues.

236
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:35,780
Chong,

237
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,060
I'll leave this to you.

238
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:41,260
You must find clues about the murderer.

239
00:11:42,860 --> 00:11:43,660
Father, don't worry.

240
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:50,860
Chong.

241
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:52,900
Something happened.

242
00:11:55,140 --> 00:11:56,010
The Xie family was wiped out

243
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,690
and Xie Ming is the only surviver.

244
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:58,580
What?

245
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,900
When?

246
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,250
Yesterday morning.

247
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:02,820
Who would wipe out a family

248
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,700
in broad daylight?

249
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:05,820
Did Xie Ming see

250
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:06,700
the murderer's face?

251
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:09,250
When my father heard about this,

252
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,420
he was so angry that he coughed blood.

253
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:11,940
I'll go to Xiangzhou on his behalf.

254
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:13,060
How is father?

255
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:14,620
He's fine for now.

256
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,420
I'll go with you to Xiangzhou.

257
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,290
Me too.

258
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:19,530
Take me with you.

259
00:12:19,970 --> 00:12:21,260
This trip is to investigate a murder case.

260
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:22,620
It's not a child's play.

261
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:23,460
You girls

262
00:12:23,500 --> 00:12:24,220
stay out of it.

263
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:25,340
Meng Tang.

264
00:12:25,780 --> 00:12:26,780
Take her back to Jian'an City.

265
00:12:27,180 --> 00:12:27,500
Yes.

266
00:12:27,860 --> 00:12:28,620
No.

267
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:30,340
I just got here.

268
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,900
I don't want to leave my brother.

269
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:34,100
Yaoyao.

270
00:12:35,260 --> 00:12:36,380
I'll ask Xi Feng and Meng Tang

271
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,940
to send her back.

272
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,220
It'll be easier on the way.

273
00:12:40,260 --> 00:12:41,260
Chong is so thoughtful.

274
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:42,940
Say thank you to Master Chong.

275
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,860
Thank you, Master Chong.

276
00:12:46,220 --> 00:12:46,540
Young Master.

277
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,460
I'll take her back.

278
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:49,260
Go.

279
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:49,700
Miss.

280
00:12:50,100 --> 00:12:50,500
Please.

281
00:12:53,900 --> 00:12:55,700
You must not hesitate

282
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:56,660
to investigate the case.

283
00:12:57,620 --> 00:12:58,500
Let's go now.

284
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:00,180
Take me with you.

285
00:13:00,860 --> 00:13:02,340
After all, Xie Ming is my classmate.

286
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,020
I also want to contribute.

287
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,340
Okay.

288
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:08,300
Go back and get ready.

289
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,020
Okay.

290
00:13:11,740 --> 00:13:12,380
Let's go too.

291
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:18,260
The Xie family was wiped out.

292
00:13:19,220 --> 00:13:21,020
We still have no clue who did it.

293
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,140
I'm so worried.

294
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,380
If the murderer

295
00:13:25,620 --> 00:13:26,500
commits another crime,

296
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,850
what should we do?

297
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:29,940
I'm afraid

298
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,380
he's targeting our families.

299
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,700
Leave the issue of the secret manual

300
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:33,940
aside.

301
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,420
The Chief has come out.

302
00:13:36,860 --> 00:13:38,820
We need his protection.

303
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,060
That's right.

304
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,130
The Chief will definitely go to Xiangzhou

305
00:13:42,340 --> 00:13:43,220
to investigate the Xie family's murder.

306
00:13:43,460 --> 00:13:44,580
We should go to Xiangzhou.

307
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:46,580
Yes.

308
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:49,100
Xiangzhou.

309
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,140
Why didn't you knock again?

310
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:13,180
This investigation

311
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,420
might be dangerous.

312
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:16,300
You should have a handy weapon

313
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:17,010
to protect yourself.

314
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,300
I went to the armory and chose for a long time.

315
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,580
I thought you might

316
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:21,700
like this sword.

317
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:23,100
Thanks.

318
00:14:28,820 --> 00:14:31,300
So many gems.

319
00:14:32,580 --> 00:14:33,610
This sword is called Ruyi.

320
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:35,700
Legend has it that its earliest owner

321
00:14:35,820 --> 00:14:36,980
is a close friend

322
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,020
of Cheng Qianyi.

323
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,700
A close friend of

324
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:42,980
Cheng Qianyi.

325
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,900
Is she his girlfriend?

326
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,140
It is said that this best friend

327
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,340
is indeed a woman.

328
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,740
If that's true,

329
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:53,060
it'll be valuable.

330
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,460
So beautiful.

331
00:14:58,820 --> 00:14:59,820
This sword is meant to be with you.

332
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:01,420
Why don't you change its name?

333
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:02,020
No.

334
00:15:03,940 --> 00:15:05,660
Ruyi means "according to my wishes."

335
00:15:05,940 --> 00:15:07,060
What a nice name.

336
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,180
By the way,

337
00:15:12,780 --> 00:15:14,380
this is the mental cultivation I copied for you.

338
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,940
Practice when you're free.

339
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,420
I'll teach you when I have time.

340
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:19,340
Thanks.

341
00:15:20,020 --> 00:15:20,890
Hurry up and pack.

342
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:21,980
I'll wait for you outside.

343
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:44,980
What happened?

344
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,330
This...

345
00:15:46,340 --> 00:15:47,900
It wasn't on fire when I left.

346
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:50,620
Who set the fire?

347
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:53,490
Who set the fire?

348
00:15:54,060 --> 00:15:55,300
Maybe the murderer sneaked back

349
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,260
to destroy the evidence.

350
00:15:57,540 --> 00:15:58,580
This man

351
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,420
is vicious.

352
00:16:00,780 --> 00:16:02,500
I think the murderer is a lunatic.

353
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:03,980
If I catch him,

354
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:06,020
I will cut him into pieces.

355
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:08,940
Everyone,

356
00:16:09,500 --> 00:16:10,700
let's search as soon as possible

357
00:16:11,130 --> 00:16:12,420
and see if we can find any clues.

358
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,140
Let's go.

359
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:14,820
Let's go.

[Fahua Classic]

361

Young Master.

362
00:16:37,940 --> 00:16:39,860
Master Chong came to Xiangzhou with his men

363
00:16:40,130 --> 00:16:41,260
to investigate the massacre of the Xie family.

364
00:16:41,610 --> 00:16:42,740
Do you want to go there?

365
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:43,980
No.

366
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:45,980
Leave me alone.

367
00:16:47,140 --> 00:16:47,460
Yes.

Nothing.

00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:25,700
We couldn’t find anything.

371
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,180

372
00:17:28,339 --> 00:17:29,090
all the clues.

373
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:31,860
How despicable.

374
00:17:32,580 --> 00:17:33,460
He even burned up

375
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:34,500
all the bodies of the Xie family.

376

Go and

00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:47,500
search around the area.

Take care of yourself.

You can only take revenge when you recover.

387
00:17:56,850 --> 00:17:58,090
According to Xie Ming,

00:18:00,180 --> 00:18:02,730
is not only cruel,

390
00:18:03,300 --> 00:18:04,500
but his martial arts skills

391
00:18:04,860 --> 00:18:07,300
are also at an unprecedented level.

392
00:18:07,980 --> 00:18:08,780
No one here

393
00:18:08,980 --> 00:18:10,260
is a match for him.

394
00:18:11,820 --> 00:18:12,580
If so,

395
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,580
that person

396
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,700
will become a hidden risk in the martial arts world.

397
00:18:16,940 --> 00:18:18,100
We must find him

398
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,180
as soon as possible.

399
00:18:19,580 --> 00:18:21,580
Otherwise, the consequences will be unimaginable.

400
00:18:22,340 --> 00:18:23,340
Although the clues have been cut off,

401
00:18:23,730 --> 00:18:24,980
don't be discouraged.

402
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:26,860
Ming,

403
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:28,740
we will help you catch

404
00:18:28,900 --> 00:18:29,540
that demon.

405
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:43,260
Thank you

406
00:18:44,620 --> 00:18:46,010
for helping the Xie family.

407
00:18:55,340 --> 00:18:55,690
My dear!

408
00:18:58,860 --> 00:18:59,300
My dear.

409
00:19:03,060 --> 00:19:03,660
My dear.

410
00:19:10,980 --> 00:19:11,420
My dear.

411
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:14,700
Are you feeling better?

412
00:19:16,780 --> 00:19:17,180
I...

413
00:19:18,660 --> 00:19:20,620
I don't have much time left.

414
00:19:21,580 --> 00:19:22,170
My dear.

415
00:19:22,500 --> 00:19:23,940
What are you talking about?

416
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:26,570
You will live a long life.

417
00:19:27,420 --> 00:19:29,060
When I was in seclusion,

418
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,890
I secretly practised the skills on the Shanhai Secret Manual.

419
00:19:33,580 --> 00:19:38,100
But it backfired.

420
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,060
It's not something

421
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,860
a normal person can cultivate.

422
00:19:43,220 --> 00:19:45,820
I've been fighting the backfire for a long time.

423
00:19:46,580 --> 00:19:47,460
But

424
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,530
it's about time

425
00:19:51,100 --> 00:19:53,050
I reach my limits.

426
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:54,220
How could this happen?

427
00:19:56,420 --> 00:19:57,100
No.

428
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,340
Absolutely not.

429
00:20:00,860 --> 00:20:01,460
My dear.

430
00:20:02,140 --> 00:20:03,540
Let's go find Mr. Yunhe.

431
00:20:03,900 --> 00:20:04,700
He's a skilled physician.

432
00:20:05,060 --> 00:20:06,380
There must be a way.

433
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:08,220
It's useless.

434
00:20:09,580 --> 00:20:11,180
It's too late.

435
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,130
I won't be able to see

436
00:20:15,530 --> 00:20:18,180
my precious daughter Wan get married.

437
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,220
I won't be able to see

438
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:24,860
that unborn grandson,

439
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,540
and see

440
00:20:29,740 --> 00:20:31,730
her being happy.

441
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,420
My dear!

442
00:20:33,410 --> 00:20:33,980
My dear.

443
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,700
My dear.

444
00:20:39,100 --> 00:20:39,660
My dear.

445
00:20:42,860 --> 00:20:44,020
Tell the children

446
00:20:45,460 --> 00:20:48,260
not to look for the manual.

447
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:52,220
I’ve already destroyed

448
00:20:52,460 --> 00:20:53,700
the Shanhai Secret Manual.

449
00:20:56,140 --> 00:20:57,140
I don't want to see

450
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:59,050
my descendants

451
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:01,180
follow my footsteps

452
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:05,700
and die in vain.

453
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:12,540
Remember,

454
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:14,580
don't tell the kids about my illness.

455
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:18,980
Don't make them worry.

456
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:20,020
Okay.

457
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:21,820
I got it.

458
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,850
It's quite strange.

459
00:21:24,620 --> 00:21:25,300
Who did it?

460
00:21:25,340 --> 00:21:26,060
It's cruel.

461
00:21:26,540 --> 00:21:27,940
That's right. It's so miserable.

462
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:28,890
Do you think the Xie family

463
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:30,300
made an enemy?

464
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:32,740
I think the murderer

465
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:34,500
would still be around here.

466
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:36,250
Maybe we can find

467
00:21:36,380 --> 00:21:37,260
some clues soon.

468
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:39,810
In my opinion,

469
00:21:40,860 --> 00:21:41,820
we should divide

470
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:42,780
into groups

471
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:44,500
and hide in every corner of Xiangzhou.

472
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,580
Master Chong, Miss Zhuwan.

473
00:21:48,940 --> 00:21:49,460
Bad news.

474
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,140
What's wrong? Slow down.

475
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,220
The Chief is seriously ill

476
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:53,780
and is waiting for you.

477
00:21:54,530 --> 00:21:55,060
What did you say?

478
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:56,210
Chief was fine yesterday.

479
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:57,300
Why did he suddenly get sick?

480
00:21:58,730 --> 00:21:59,220
Father.

481
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:05,930
[Murong Mansion]

482
00:22:05,930 --> 00:22:10,590
[Gathering Fortune]

483
00:22:08,220 --> 00:22:09,260
He's out.

484
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:18,900
Chong, Wan.

485
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:22,340
Your father wants you to go inside.

486
00:22:39,900 --> 00:22:40,380
Father!

487
00:22:40,940 --> 00:22:41,380
Father!

488
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:46,180
Chong.

489
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,900
Take your mother

490
00:22:48,420 --> 00:22:49,860
outside for a while.

491
00:22:50,940 --> 00:22:53,740
I need to talk to Wan.

492
00:23:04,930 --> 00:23:05,500
Father.

493
00:23:06,940 --> 00:23:07,540
Chong.

494
00:23:09,970 --> 00:23:10,940
You should leave first.

495
00:23:16,300 --> 00:23:16,980
My dear,

496
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,940
let me stay and serve you.

497
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,960
[Gathering Fortune]

498
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:23,140
Mr. Murong.

499
00:23:23,420 --> 00:23:24,300
How is Chief?

500
00:23:25,580 --> 00:23:26,100
Chong.

501
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:27,980
How is elder brother?

502
00:23:28,420 --> 00:23:29,020
Yes, how is he?

503
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:29,860
What's the situation?

504
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,060
Is the Chief alright?

505
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,660
Tell me.

506
00:23:38,130 --> 00:23:38,700
Why did it

507
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,060
suddenly become like this?

508
00:23:40,220 --> 00:23:40,740
How?

509
00:23:42,060 --> 00:23:43,940
Wan!

510
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:45,780
Dad, I'm here.

511
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:48,660
I'm old.

512
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,140
I can't accompany you anymore.

513
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:56,860
Father.

514
00:23:57,700 --> 00:23:59,660
Why can't you accompany me?

515
00:24:00,140 --> 00:24:00,860
We

516
00:24:02,490 --> 00:24:04,340
all die eventually.

517
00:24:08,540 --> 00:24:09,340
Wan.

518
00:24:11,580 --> 00:24:12,810
I still remember

519
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:16,300
what you were like

520
00:24:16,340 --> 00:24:17,780
when you were born.

521
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,850
You were so small

522
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,260
and cute.

523
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:31,020
I dare not hug you.

524
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,780
I didn't want to hurt you.

525
00:24:36,540 --> 00:24:39,260
But I'm very content

526
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:44,220
to see you grow up healthily.

527
00:24:47,380 --> 00:24:49,820
I also feel regret.

528
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,420
Unfortunately,

529
00:24:54,740 --> 00:24:56,140
I can't see you

530
00:24:57,570 --> 00:24:59,940
marry a good man.

531
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:03,620
I won't see you

532
00:25:05,100 --> 00:25:07,820
in a beautiful wedding dress,

533
00:25:09,820 --> 00:25:11,010
and see

534
00:25:12,420 --> 00:25:14,260
you become

535
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,330
the happiest bride in the world.

536
00:25:17,980 --> 00:25:18,500
Father.

537
00:25:19,700 --> 00:25:20,690
Don't say that.

538
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:21,730
I'm scared.

539
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:26,500
Father.

540
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:28,060
I have many treasures now.

541
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,940
My treasures...

542
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:30,340
And I have a lot of money.

543
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:30,900
I'll give you everything.

544
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,420
Please don't be like this.

545
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,300
Get well soon.

546
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:36,660
Silly girl.

547
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:38,380
Don't be silly.

548
00:25:38,660 --> 00:25:39,100
Father.

549
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:43,100
In my heart,

550
00:25:46,180 --> 00:25:47,420
Wan

551
00:25:49,690 --> 00:25:51,300
is not silly at all.

552
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,290
She is the best gift

553
00:25:55,500 --> 00:25:57,780
given to me by God.

554
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:03,140
She is my beloved daughter.

555
00:26:06,900 --> 00:26:07,900
Wan,

556
00:26:11,860 --> 00:26:13,940
I can't accompany you anymore.

557
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:19,660
Be good.

558
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:21,940
Don't cry, baby.

559
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:22,980
Don't cry.

560
00:26:23,820 --> 00:26:24,740
Wan.

561
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:27,220
Be good.

562
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:30,860
You must

563
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,780
be strong.

564
00:26:35,420 --> 00:26:36,580
I have you.

565
00:26:48,820 --> 00:26:49,420
Father.

566
00:26:52,580 --> 00:26:53,220
Father.

567
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,140
I still need to peel shrimp for you.

568
00:26:57,140 --> 00:26:57,940
I want to buy you

569
00:26:58,140 --> 00:26:59,940
many nice clothes

570
00:27:00,290 --> 00:27:01,660
and food.

571
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,580
And spend a lot of money.

572
00:27:04,460 --> 00:27:04,980
Father.

573
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,100
Father!

574
00:27:14,020 --> 00:27:14,500
Father!

00:27:17,900 --> 00:27:19,020
Father!

576
00:27:21,060 --> 00:27:22,770
Father!

577
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:24,020
Father.

578
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:25,860
Aunt.

579
00:27:28,900 --> 00:27:29,780
Go in. Hurry.

580
00:27:30,330 --> 00:27:31,100
Let's go.

581
00:27:34,260 --> 00:27:34,740
Chief.

582
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,060
Chief.

583
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:01,420

00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,490
[Mourn]

586
00:28:26,980 --> 00:28:29,580
Thank you for coming.

587
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,660
When Chief Murong was in power,

588
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,130
he was diligent.

589
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:37,580
This was unexpected...

590
00:28:38,620 --> 00:28:39,140
Yeah.

591
00:28:39,900 --> 00:28:41,460
What a pity.

592
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:44,860
Chief Murong suddenly passed away.

593
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:47,050
The next Chief of the Martial Arts World...

594
00:28:47,900 --> 00:28:50,660
Before my husband passed away,

595
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,140
he left a will.

596
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,580
The candidate for the new Chief has been decided.

597
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:57,570
Since everyone is here today,

598
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,100
I'll tell you.

599
00:29:01,660 --> 00:29:03,540
In his last words

600
00:29:03,940 --> 00:29:06,860
my husband said to pass the position of Chief to

601
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,490
Murong Chong.

602
00:29:09,140 --> 00:29:09,530
Yes.

603
00:29:10,260 --> 00:29:10,580
That makes sense.

604
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:11,780
Yes, indeed.

605
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,020
Master Chong is gifted

606
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:18,300
and a legitimate relative.

607
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,050
It's justifiable.

608
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:21,620
That's right.

609
00:29:22,220 --> 00:29:24,860
Besides, Master Chong is upright and kind.

610
00:29:25,060 --> 00:29:25,660
I believe

611
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,620
he can maintain the order of the martial arts world

612
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,140
and lead us upright sects

613
00:29:30,420 --> 00:29:31,980
to success.

614
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:36,540
Looks like everyone acknowledges Chong.

615
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:37,940
In that case...

616
00:29:38,380 --> 00:29:38,780
Wait.

617
00:29:40,980 --> 00:29:42,330
I still have an objection.

618
00:29:48,180 --> 00:29:49,300
It's Yu.

619
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:52,540
What do you mean?

620
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:53,780
Sister-in-law.

621
00:29:54,820 --> 00:29:57,660
I don't deny Chong is talented.

622
00:29:58,090 --> 00:29:59,770
But his martial arts

623
00:29:59,940 --> 00:30:01,660
is not advanced yet.

624
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,500
I'm afraid it's hard to convince the people.

625
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:08,060
What do you suggest?

626
00:30:09,460 --> 00:30:10,050
I wouldn't dare.

627
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:13,540
With three elders of the Murong family here,

628
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:16,540
we need to discuss this matter further.

629
00:30:18,180 --> 00:30:19,820
The three elders are here too.

630
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:20,420
Su.

631
00:30:20,860 --> 00:30:23,340
Someone else should be selected as the Chief.

632
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:25,020
Master Chong is still young.

633
00:30:25,260 --> 00:30:28,060
I'm afraid it's hard for him to take the responsibility.

634
00:30:28,330 --> 00:30:28,940
Yes.

635
00:30:29,460 --> 00:30:30,180
I think

636
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:32,220
he should practice for a few more years.

637
00:30:33,140 --> 00:30:35,490
Murong Yu is skilled in martial arts and qualifications.

638
00:30:35,740 --> 00:30:38,780
He can temporarily be the Chief.

639
00:30:40,220 --> 00:30:41,420
Elders,

640
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:43,460
you value me so much.

641
00:30:43,820 --> 00:30:45,540
I don't deserve this honor.

642
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:47,780
If you can't

643
00:30:47,900 --> 00:30:49,100
become the Chief,

644
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,180
I think

645
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,220
no one can do it.

646
00:30:54,220 --> 00:30:55,300
In that case,

647
00:30:55,580 --> 00:30:57,860
I'll temporarily be the Chief.

648
00:30:58,980 --> 00:31:01,330
When Chong becomes more able in the future,

649
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:03,580
I'll pass the position

650
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,820
to him.

651
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:07,780
What do you think?

652
00:31:12,140 --> 00:31:13,060
I think you

653
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:14,620
are becoming senile.

654
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,380
Elders,

655
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:19,500
the Chief's body is not yet cold

656
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,420
and you turned to Murong Yu

657
00:31:21,780 --> 00:31:23,180
to force both of us

658
00:31:23,410 --> 00:31:24,860
to give up the position of Chief.

659
00:31:25,620 --> 00:31:27,540
Are you worthy of the efforts that Chief has put

660
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,580
into managing the martial arts world over the years?

661
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:30,330
Are you worthy

662
00:31:30,420 --> 00:31:31,660
of his trust in you?

663
00:31:32,380 --> 00:31:33,380
Sister-in-law,

664
00:31:33,490 --> 00:31:34,660
you are wrong.

665
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,050
The three elders just think

666
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:38,300
the position of Chief

667
00:31:38,500 --> 00:31:40,340
should be taken by the capable.

668
00:31:41,660 --> 00:31:43,500
You can ask everyone here

669
00:31:43,940 --> 00:31:45,340
about Chong's ability.

670
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,490
[Fu Mansion]

671
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,740
The Chief is dead.

672
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,460
Jian'an has changed its owner.

673
00:32:28,460 --> 00:32:29,900
Lord Fu should have received

674
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,290
the secret letter I sent.

675
00:32:34,580 --> 00:32:36,780
It’s time to go back to Shengyue Mountain.

676
00:32:37,380 --> 00:32:37,740
Yes.

677
00:32:38,210 --> 00:32:39,770
[Fahua Classic]

678
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,010
Chong

679
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:46,210
only knows a few tricks.

680
00:32:47,300 --> 00:32:48,820
He can't take up great responsibilities.

681
00:32:49,260 --> 00:32:49,540
You...

682
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,660
Sister-in-law,

683
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:54,460
give me the seal of the Chief.

684
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,020
Don't force yourself anymore.

685
00:32:57,140 --> 00:32:57,700
Step aside.

686
00:33:03,420 --> 00:33:03,780
I didn’t expect

687
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,020
the Chief Master of Mount Shengyue

688
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,900
to force the widow of the Chief

689
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:10,860
during the Chief's funeral

690
00:33:11,180 --> 00:33:12,690
to take the position of Chief.

691
00:33:14,770 --> 00:33:16,300
It really

692
00:33:16,500 --> 00:33:17,980
is an eye-opener.

693
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:18,820
Brother.

694
00:33:19,300 --> 00:33:20,540
They've gone too far.

695
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,860
You must uphold justice

696
00:33:21,980 --> 00:33:23,180
for Chong and me.

697
00:33:23,410 --> 00:33:24,340
Don't worry.

698
00:33:25,460 --> 00:33:26,580
I won't let you and Chong

699
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:27,580
suffer.
