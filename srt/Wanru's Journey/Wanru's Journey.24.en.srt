[Episode 24]

4
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:44,539
Did you get Zhuwan and Fu Yao settled?

5
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:50,820
Xi Feng.

6
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:55,420
How long have you been with me?

7
00:01:56,259 --> 00:01:56,940
Eleven years.

8
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:02,620
Eleven years.

9
00:02:03,980 --> 00:02:04,940
I've regarded you

10
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:05,820
my family.

11
00:02:06,940 --> 00:02:07,570
Master Chong.

12
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:11,570
If I can't survive

13
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:14,530
tomorrow's battle,

14
00:02:15,980 --> 00:02:16,940
take care of yourself.

15
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:20,020
You must live on.

16
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,980
Protect Hong and Zhuwan.

17
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:27,820
Master Chong.

18
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:29,340
Enough. Say no more.

19
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:31,940
Take it

20
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:36,740
as my last wish.

21
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:44,300
Yes.

22
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:46,690
Master Chong.

23
00:02:58,220 --> 00:02:58,620
Master Hong.

24
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:00,580
Have a seat.

25
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:08,980
Zhuwan and Miss Yao

26
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:10,060
have been hidden.

27
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:20,290
How is it?

28
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,300
Your tea is as good as ever.

29
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:28,140
This battle

30
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,380
is very dangerous.

31
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,579
How many odds do you think we have?

32
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,740
I don't know.

33
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:37,540
I have a favor to ask you.

34
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,980
Take Fu Yao away.

35
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:46,300
I've get Miss Yao settled.

36
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,300
You know what I mean.

37
00:03:51,210 --> 00:03:52,180
Go with her.

38
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:55,940
Master Hong.

39
00:03:58,740 --> 00:03:59,820
If I die,

40
00:04:00,740 --> 00:04:01,340
Fu Yao

41
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:03,610
will be the only heir left in the Fu family.

42
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,580
You must take her away.

43
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:07,140
Go as far as possible.

44
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,020
You want me to leave you alone?

45
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:10,700
I can't do as you say.

46
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:12,900
Meng Tang.

47
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,500
I've been following you since young.

48
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:17,540
I'll follow you wherever you are.

49
00:04:18,140 --> 00:04:19,019
If you win,

50
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:20,140
I will live.

51
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:21,620
If you lose,

52
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:23,060
I will die.

53
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,220
My life belongs to you.

54
00:04:25,940 --> 00:04:26,900
I will never leave you.

55
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,780
The moon tonight

56
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:54,050
is as beautiful as that I saw from Mount Shengyue.

57
00:04:57,180 --> 00:04:58,250
But it's a pity that this wine

58
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:01,460
is not as mellow as Qionghua Wine.

59
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:07,860
I wonder if after tomorrow

60
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,380
we can still get to

61
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:12,900
enjoy the moon

62
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:15,050
and drink together.

63
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:21,300
Hong,

64
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,020
I always treat you

65
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,260
as my confidant.

66
00:05:27,050 --> 00:05:28,100
You are my confidant

67
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,540
and family.

68
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:33,180
We wrote our vows with paint

69
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:39,940
and will never forget each other.

70
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,180
Governor, Master Chong.

71
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:00,050
They're coming.

72
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:22,500
Meng Tang.

73
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,100
You're still alive.

74
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:27,700
You don't have to worry about me.

75
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:30,140
Fu Hong fabricated Meng Tang's death and pretended

76
00:06:30,730 --> 00:06:32,060
to go against Murong Chong.

77
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,420
He deceived everyone.

78
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:36,500
It shows that they have evil intentions.

79
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,730
Where are Fu Hong and Murong Chong?

80
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,380
Where did they hide?

81
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:43,140
Why did they just send two watchdogs

82
00:06:43,540 --> 00:06:45,060
to block the way?

83
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:47,180
They don't show up now.

84
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,300
Are they

85
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:50,100
cowards?

86
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:51,659
Whoever dares to insult the Young Master

87
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,340
will die.

88
00:06:52,900 --> 00:06:54,620
You're just a servant.

89
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,940
How arrogant.

90
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:59,020
With the number of you,

91
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:00,700
let's see how much

92
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:02,020
you can do.

93
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:03,100
Today,

94
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,210
I won't let you villains

95
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,820
get away again.

96
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,130
Brother, you sound so ambitious.

97
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,620
You practiced the Shanhai Secret Manual in secret,

98
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,780
went insane

99
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,260
and caused the massacre.

100
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:34,140
You plotted to frame your brother.

101
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:35,420
Today,

102
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:37,180
you even want to kill us

103
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,140
to get your problem solved once and for all.

104
00:07:39,380 --> 00:07:39,940
Brother.

105
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:42,500
I didn't know

106
00:07:43,060 --> 00:07:44,420
you had such ambition.

107
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:45,940
Otherwise,

108
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:47,700
I'll let you

109
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:48,930
be the Chief.

110
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,340
What are you talking about?

111
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:53,060
Everyone in the martial arts world knows

112
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,340
you are the devil who wiped out those sects.

113
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,500
You're dying.

114
00:07:58,140 --> 00:07:59,420
How dare you frame me?

115
00:08:00,340 --> 00:08:01,100
Murong Wei.

116
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,740
Do you really think

117
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,260
Fu Sou will help you restore the Murong family

118
00:08:06,860 --> 00:08:08,580
and help you become the Supreme Lord?

119
00:08:09,380 --> 00:08:11,020
Let me remind you.

120
00:08:11,540 --> 00:08:12,620
Don't be used by him.

121
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:13,980
Fu Sou

122
00:08:14,420 --> 00:08:15,610
even dared to kill

123
00:08:15,740 --> 00:08:16,820
his brother and sister-in-law.

124
00:08:17,420 --> 00:08:18,100
Nonsense!

125
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:19,940
You devil

126
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,140
colluded with Fu Hong

127
00:08:21,780 --> 00:08:23,810
to harm the martial arts world.

128
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:25,100
I think

129
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:26,620
you're stalling.

130
00:08:27,370 --> 00:08:28,100
I've found

131
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:29,340
my father's real will.

132
00:08:29,820 --> 00:08:31,620
He told me the truth.

133
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:32,940
Back then,

134
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:34,330
you arranged a maid

135
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:36,220
to feed my mother a lot of safflower

136
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:37,659
so that she died of hemorrhage

137
00:08:37,820 --> 00:08:38,700
when she was giving labor.

138
00:08:39,419 --> 00:08:40,580
You bribed the midwife

139
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:41,980
to frame the Murong family.

140
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:43,900
When you were fighting for power,

141
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:45,780
you poisoned my father's tea

142
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:46,730
and forged evidence

143
00:08:47,220 --> 00:08:48,500
to frame the Murong Mansion.

144
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:49,700
You aimed

145
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:51,460
to make me and Murong Chong

146
00:08:51,540 --> 00:08:52,380
go against each other.

147
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,650
You even sent people

148
00:08:53,780 --> 00:08:54,740
to kill me and Yao.

149
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:55,820
Really?

150
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:57,340
How could you be so cruel?

151
00:08:58,660 --> 00:08:59,970
I called you Uncle.

152
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,660
Don't listen to

153
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,780
these two demons.

154
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,300
Everyone saw

155
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:08,900
that Murong Chong massacred those sects.

156
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,100
These two devils

157
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,500
have gone insane

158
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,980
due to the Shanhai Secret Manual.

159
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:17,100
Fu Hong covers the devil up.

160
00:09:17,460 --> 00:09:19,260
He is clearly in cahoots with him.

161
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,660
Yes, Fu Hong.

162
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:22,300
You killed Miss Su

163
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,220
with the Divine Art of Shanhai.

164
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:25,500
It's the truth.

165
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,780
Our Su family

166
00:09:27,140 --> 00:09:27,900
is definitely going

167
00:09:28,020 --> 00:09:29,540
to avenge Miss Su!

168
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:31,220
Avenge Miss Su!

169
00:09:31,460 --> 00:09:32,700
Avenge Miss Su!

170
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,580
Avenge Miss Su!

171
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:35,460
Kill them!

172
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:45,940
Kill!

173
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,140
Hong.

174
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,180
These people

175
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,580
-are so unreasonable. -Attack!

176
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,740
I'm going to wake them up.

177
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,730
You've improved a lot.

178
00:12:06,940 --> 00:12:08,180
So Murong Wei is the devil.

179
00:12:51,860 --> 00:12:53,140
Murong Chong! Fu Hong!

180
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,020
If anything happens to you,

181
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,300
I'll teach you a lesson.

182
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:13,180
Father!

183
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:17,940
Father.

184
00:13:18,900 --> 00:13:19,580
I'm unfilial.

185
00:13:20,740 --> 00:13:21,460
I'm useless.

186
00:13:22,460 --> 00:13:22,820
Father.

187
00:13:23,420 --> 00:13:23,700
I didn't expect

188
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:24,540
the two of them to be strong

189
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,540
when they join hands.

190
00:13:26,250 --> 00:13:26,620
I absorbed

191
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,620
the internal energy of so many people.

192
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:29,460
But I still can't defeat them.

193
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:30,250
Father.

194
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:31,980
Why?

195
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:34,140
Father.

196
00:13:35,020 --> 00:13:35,730
Give me time.

197
00:13:36,570 --> 00:13:37,460
As long as you give me time,

198
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,100
I will

199
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:39,090
defeat those two devils.

200
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:41,100
Father, trust me.

201
00:13:41,380 --> 00:13:42,060
Trust me.

202
00:13:45,860 --> 00:13:46,100
Father.

203
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:47,100
Father.

204
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:51,740
Father!

205
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:52,740
Father!

206
00:13:55,180 --> 00:13:55,460
Father!

207
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:57,020
Father!

208
00:13:57,420 --> 00:13:58,580
I'm your son.

209
00:13:58,580 --> 00:14:00,460
You don't have time.

210
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,980
You're average.

211
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,060
It's your honor

212
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:05,700
to sacrifice for me.

213
00:14:37,980 --> 00:14:38,420
Chief.

214
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:39,420
Chief.

215
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:41,300
Chief.

216
00:14:43,860 --> 00:14:44,940
I'm almost done

217
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,220
with the things we discussed.

218
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,980
But Master Wei is missing.

219
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,860
Besides, Murong Chong and Fu Hong

220
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,740
have mastered the Divine Art of Shanhai.

221
00:14:54,130 --> 00:14:55,370
They're so strong.

222
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:03,900
As to Wei,

223
00:15:04,850 --> 00:15:06,700
I've sucked him dry.

224
00:15:10,460 --> 00:15:11,820
Your mission

225
00:15:14,060 --> 00:15:15,460
is done.

226
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:24,580
Father.

227
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,020
Is what you said

228
00:15:27,970 --> 00:15:28,940
all true?

229
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:31,940
Why?

230
00:15:32,740 --> 00:15:35,420
Of course for the Shanhai Secret Manual.

231
00:15:36,620 --> 00:15:38,020
As long as I succeed in mastering it,

232
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,740
I can control everything.

233
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,620
Fortunately, you didn't

234
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:45,580
let me down

235
00:15:46,140 --> 00:15:47,140
nor wasted

236
00:15:47,260 --> 00:15:48,860
my efforts.

237
00:15:49,300 --> 00:15:49,940
But haven't you already

238
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:51,580
mastered the Divine Art of Shanhai?

239
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:55,260
The Divine Art of Shanhai

240
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:58,650
is not as simple as you think.

241
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:02,500
I've been working hard for more than a decade

242
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:05,700
and devoted myself to the manual.

243
00:16:07,140 --> 00:16:08,620
But I didn't understand

244
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:09,900
the mysteries in it

245
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:11,890
until one day,

246
00:16:13,340 --> 00:16:14,900
I found that to master the manual, people with each of attributes

247
00:16:15,500 --> 00:16:15,940
including

248
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:16,340
justice,

249
00:16:16,820 --> 00:16:17,100
evil,

250
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:17,700
yin

251
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:18,460
and yang

252
00:16:18,780 --> 00:16:20,260
are required.

253
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:22,180
After you have successfully practiced separately

254
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,820
and then converge as one,

255
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:25,860
the Divine Art can be mastered.

256
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,740
And all of you

257
00:16:28,290 --> 00:16:29,820
are my pawns,

258
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:32,140
including your father.

259
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,740
I killed him long ago.

260
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,260
I pretended to be the Chief,

261
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:39,260
made each of you get

262
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,180
the part of the manual with corresponding attribute

263
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,420
and asked you to cultivate respectively.

264
00:16:43,250 --> 00:16:43,710
[Fahua Classic]

265
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,340
Go to Xiangzhou and take care of the ancestral business.

266
00:16:45,050 --> 00:16:47,450
[Fahua Classic]

267
00:16:45,730 --> 00:16:47,420
Study this manual carefully.

268
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,900
Shanhai Secret Manual?

269
00:16:58,260 --> 00:16:59,540
Shanhai Secret Manual?

270
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,940
After you master it,

271
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:04,099
I'll absorb your power.

272
00:17:04,420 --> 00:17:06,940
I'll be the second Cheng Qianyi.

273
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:08,180
Go to hell!

274
00:17:10,099 --> 00:17:11,099
Cheng Qianyi!

275
00:17:11,099 --> 00:17:12,380
Hong!

276
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:23,500
Stop!

277
00:17:31,460 --> 00:17:32,700
Perfect timing.

278
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:33,420
Zhuwan.

279
00:17:33,450 --> 00:17:33,780
Father.

280
00:17:34,540 --> 00:17:34,820
Zhuwan.

281
00:17:35,330 --> 00:17:35,740
Zhuwan.

282
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,140
He's no longer our father.

283
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,900
He killed our father long ago.

284
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,340
He's a monster now.

285
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,660
He did everything.

286
00:17:48,570 --> 00:17:50,380
You're not my father?

287
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:52,940
So you did

288
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:54,540
all this?

289
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,740
For Shanhai Secret Manual,

290
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:01,140
you killed people,

291
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,780
caused the Murong family to be exterminated,

292
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:05,500
and put the martial arts world into chaos.

293
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:07,820
So many people

294
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:10,160
died in vain in front of you.

295
00:18:11,050 --> 00:18:13,540
Is it worth it for a manual?

296
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:18,260
Cheng Qianyi.

297
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:20,940
I want to be the second Cheng Qianyi.

298
00:18:23,700 --> 00:18:24,730
You are one of

299
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:26,500
my pawns.

300
00:18:27,980 --> 00:18:29,660
My dear daughter.

301
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:32,980
Zhuwan. Be careful!

302
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,660
Father.

303
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:00,060
Zhuwan.

304
00:19:00,860 --> 00:19:01,660
Don't worry.

305
00:19:02,500 --> 00:19:04,220
I will find you a good doctor

306
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,740
to cure you.

307
00:19:06,020 --> 00:19:07,180
I can't be wrong

308
00:19:07,260 --> 00:19:08,300
about my own daughter.

309
00:19:08,540 --> 00:19:10,330
This body is not Zhuwan.

310
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,220
I remember you liked

311
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:13,940
shrimps the most since you were young.

312
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:15,420
You are my own child.

313
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:16,980
If I don't treat you well,

314
00:19:17,420 --> 00:19:18,460
who else will?

315
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,460
In my heart,

316
00:19:20,850 --> 00:19:21,690
you

317
00:19:22,340 --> 00:19:23,460
are the best gift

318
00:19:23,860 --> 00:19:26,220
from God.

319
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:28,380
Father.

320
00:19:29,770 --> 00:19:31,780
[Mourn]

321
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,780
Bao!

322
00:20:07,620 --> 00:20:09,220
I'll kill you.

323
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,620
Hong.

324
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:14,770
How is your injury?

325
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,380
I'll recover after recuperating

326
00:21:18,820 --> 00:21:20,180
for about half a month.

327
00:21:21,460 --> 00:21:21,940
That's good.

328
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,020
Zhuwan.

329
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,050
How is she?

330
00:21:25,580 --> 00:21:27,220
She locked herself in the room.

331
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,260
She didn't come out

332
00:21:28,820 --> 00:21:29,540
or see anyone.

333
00:21:33,860 --> 00:21:34,580
The secret of my life

334
00:21:34,730 --> 00:21:36,140
is in this box.

335
00:22:08,180 --> 00:22:09,300
So I am...

336
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:36,460
Zhuwan.

337
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,380
You want to see me?

338
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,180
I have something to tell you.

339
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,090
Me too.

340
00:22:45,220 --> 00:22:46,020
Let me speak first.

341
00:22:47,860 --> 00:22:48,180
Fine.

342
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,060
I promised you

343
00:23:00,020 --> 00:23:00,820
to protect you.

344
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,140
I also promised you

345
00:23:04,100 --> 00:23:05,140
that I would let you

346
00:23:05,330 --> 00:23:06,420
live with you own identity

347
00:23:06,860 --> 00:23:08,340
in a dignified way in this world.

348
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:09,700
Now is the time

349
00:23:09,860 --> 00:23:11,100
to fulfill my promise.

350
00:23:11,660 --> 00:23:12,100
Zhuwan.

351
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:12,900
No.

352
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,140
Ru.

353
00:23:19,460 --> 00:23:20,620
Will you accept me?

354
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,660
I...

355
00:23:28,180 --> 00:23:29,820
I am okay with the name Zhuwan.

356
00:23:30,060 --> 00:23:30,530
I'm used to it

357
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:31,980
these days.

358
00:23:36,340 --> 00:23:37,660
You suddenly became so affectionate.

359
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:38,820
I feel awkward.

360
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:42,860
What?

361
00:23:43,570 --> 00:23:44,540
You don't want to accept me?

362
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:46,820
I...

363
00:23:50,540 --> 00:23:51,820
I heard from Xi Feng that

364
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:53,140
the Murong family's old subordinates

365
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:54,540
have been assembled.

366
00:23:55,140 --> 00:23:56,140
I think

367
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,140
you want to revive the Murong family, right?

368
00:23:59,860 --> 00:24:00,500
Of course.

369
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,020
It's my mother's last wish

370
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,660
to revive the Murong family.

371
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:04,860
That's it.

372
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,340
That's the problem.

373
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:07,660
I am

374
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:08,900
born

375
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,900
to be free and unrestrained.

376
00:24:11,530 --> 00:24:13,140
So I'm not confident

377
00:24:13,300 --> 00:24:13,900
to be a good wife

378
00:24:14,020 --> 00:24:15,060
like your mother.

379
00:24:15,340 --> 00:24:16,060
Besides,

380
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:17,380
my existence

381
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:19,820
will only make people criticize you.

382
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:21,460
After all, I was your sister

383
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:22,860
for a while.

384
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:24,540
I don't care about that.

385
00:24:25,620 --> 00:24:27,020
It doesn't matter what others say.

386
00:24:28,220 --> 00:24:29,060
What matters is you.

387
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:32,330
We really can't

388
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:33,660
be together.

389
00:24:34,500 --> 00:24:35,340
Why not?

390
00:24:36,100 --> 00:24:36,900
