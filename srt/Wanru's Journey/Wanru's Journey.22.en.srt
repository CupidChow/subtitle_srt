She died a tragic death.

00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:10,460

even if you did it,

00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,220
I believe you were just impulsive.

confess to everyone,

100

here in advance.

118
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,860
But I didn't expect

119
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,780
that he dared to slander me in public.

120
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,900
I believe that you and Master Chong

121
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,460
must be wronged.

122
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:09,700
As you can see,

123
00:06:10,180 --> 00:06:10,940

124
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:12,060

I planned to buy some for her,

132
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:26,740
but I didn't expect

133
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:28,660

134
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:30,500

I'll disguise myself and come back as soon as possible.

138
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:37,580
I'll bring back the medicine for Miss Yao.

139

Don't worry, Governor Fu.

154

Come with me.

158
00:08:15,660 --> 00:08:16,540
-Yes. -Yes.

159
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:21,980
Look over there.

160
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:23,420
Surround this place.

161
00:08:23,780 --> 00:08:24,620
Yes.

162
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:30,020
They were here.

163
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:31,820
The injured Fu Yao was here too.

164
00:08:32,179 --> 00:08:33,299
How could this happen?

165
00:08:37,460 --> 00:08:38,659
Watch out!

166
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,100
This time,

167
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,700
we have finally passed.

168
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,580
Yeah.

169
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:19,740
I wonder

170
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:21,220
if Fu Sou likes

171
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:22,460
the big present you gave him?

172
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:23,820
I didn't prepare

173
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,780
enough gunpowder,

174
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,740
so we couldn't

175
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:27,220
wipe them out.

176
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:28,610
By the way, Hong,

177
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,740
how did you know

178
00:09:29,860 --> 00:09:31,130
Ting Xuan would betray you?

179
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,940
I found a little trace

180
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:35,020
when I went home on New Year's Eve two years ago.

181
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,140
What he did

182
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,700
this time

183
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:38,940
makes me more sure

184
00:09:39,100 --> 00:09:40,340
that he works for Fu Sou.

185
00:09:40,780 --> 00:09:42,660
You're really thoughtful.

186
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:45,260
But I really didn't expect

187
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,890
what had happened to Su Yueying.

188
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:49,540
Fu Sou was so cruel.

189
00:09:50,740 --> 00:09:52,340
After I took away his power,

190
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:53,700
he must be unhappy.

191
00:09:54,020 --> 00:09:55,260
I knew he would find Su Yueying

192
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:57,180
and ask her to help him regain power.

193
00:09:57,980 --> 00:09:59,220
According to Su Yueying's personality,

194
00:09:59,380 --> 00:10:00,340
she would definitely take advantage of the situation,

195
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:01,700
adding insult to his injury.

196
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,740
But I didn't expect

197
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:06,220
that Su Yueying would die because of this.

198
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:09,060
I really didn't expect that

199
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:11,500
although Su Yueying was calculating,

200
00:10:11,780 --> 00:10:12,860
she was killed

201
00:10:13,460 --> 00:10:15,660
by Fu Sou.

202
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:18,020
Fu Sou thought

203
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:19,860
he forced us to escape.

204
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:21,060
Unexpectedly,

205
00:10:21,570 --> 00:10:23,500
he's already entered our game.

206
00:10:25,340 --> 00:10:26,940
What a good idea.

207
00:10:30,540 --> 00:10:31,340
Zhuwan.

208
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,340
Zhuwan.

209
00:10:32,540 --> 00:10:33,580
Let us explain.

210
00:10:33,780 --> 00:10:34,460
I want to know

211
00:10:34,580 --> 00:10:35,460
how you explain it.

212
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:36,340
Zhuwan.

213
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:37,460
Young Master.

214
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,660
Young Master.

215
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:39,740
I checked the secret room...

216
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,880
Meng Tang?

217
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,860
Zhuwan.

218
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,100
It's not what you think.

219
00:10:46,380 --> 00:10:48,460
-So it's fake that you two are against each other. -No.

220
00:10:48,490 --> 00:10:49,530
-The death of Meng Tang is fake. -We hid it from you

221
00:10:49,530 --> 00:10:51,100
-for your safety. -It's not like that.

222
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,500
Even your coming all the way to me

223
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:53,620
is fake.

224
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,540
And we didn't mean to lie to you.

225
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:55,380
What have you done?

226
00:10:55,380 --> 00:10:55,860
We just wanted to ensure your safety.

227
00:10:55,860 --> 00:10:56,580
Your sister, Fu Yao

228
00:10:56,780 --> 00:10:57,820
is lying in the carriage now.

229
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:58,900
She is seriously injured.

230
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:01,100
Murong Bao died.

231
00:11:03,900 --> 00:11:05,060
All of these

232
00:11:05,220 --> 00:11:06,980
are made by your self-righteousness.

233
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:09,380
I'm sorry.

234
00:11:10,020 --> 00:11:11,980
You shouldn't apologize to me.

235
00:11:18,460 --> 00:11:19,260
Zhuwan.

236
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:20,820
Don't touch me.

237
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,700
Zhuwan has a grudge now.

238
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,500
Let her calm down first.

239
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,540
Yao's injury is fine now.

240
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:38,380
But she still needs to recuperate.

241
00:11:39,020 --> 00:11:39,780
Chong and I

242
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,660
are wanted by the martial artists world.

243
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,300
Meng Tang, take Yao

244
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:44,660
to hide in Lingdong.

245
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,060
Xi Feng,  you go with them.

246
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,020
Yes.

247
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:48,130
But

248
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,580
your safety...

249
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,380
Don't worry.

250
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,580
The way to Mount Jiuju is a long journey.

251
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,220
It's not easy to be noticed.

252
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,420
We'll be safe.

253
00:11:55,220 --> 00:11:55,660
Yes.

254
00:11:55,820 --> 00:11:57,500
Meng Tang, you pretended to be dead.

255
00:11:57,860 --> 00:11:58,380
The things that

256
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,180
we can't do in person

257
00:12:00,330 --> 00:12:01,540
need to be dealt with by you.

258
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,940
Come back early.

259
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,340
Also, Fu Yao is in the carriage now.

260
00:12:05,500 --> 00:12:06,540
She's unconscious.

261
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:08,420
Be careful at all times.

262
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:09,700
Don't worry.

263
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:17,130
This is the first time

264
00:12:17,130 --> 00:12:18,500
I've seen Zhuwan so furious.

265
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:19,740
Hong,

266
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,140
we've set such a big trap,

267
00:12:22,540 --> 00:12:23,380
but we still couldn't find

268
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:24,340
who is behind

269
00:12:24,340 --> 00:12:25,100
Fu Sou and Murong Wei.

270
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:27,060
This person is unfathomable.

271
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,250
Although we've investigated for so long,

272
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:29,500
there's still no clue found.

273
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:32,940
Let's find Zhuwan

274
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:33,900
and explain to her.

275
00:12:34,380 --> 00:12:35,460
I hope she can forgive us.

276
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:42,380
Murong Chong,

277
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,620
you tricked me so badly.

278
00:12:46,940 --> 00:12:48,010
But I was worried about you two

279
00:12:48,220 --> 00:12:49,420
every day.

280
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:52,700
I don't know since when

281
00:12:53,490 --> 00:12:54,020
your image always appears

282
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,140
in my mind.

283
00:12:55,620 --> 00:12:56,500
Your voice

284
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:59,100
always rings in my ears.

285
00:13:04,900 --> 00:13:06,540
If you want a peaceful life,

286
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:09,260
then stay by my side,

287
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:11,660
I will protect you.

288
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:14,700
Then I'll tell the truth

289
00:13:14,860 --> 00:13:16,370
to my father tomorrow,

290
00:13:16,810 --> 00:13:17,650
so that you can

291
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:18,660
live as who you are

292
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,540
in the world.

293
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,100
By then,

294
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:24,340
I will marry you

295
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,980
with a luxurious wedding.

296
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,180
Since you will go to

297
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,380
Jian'an City this time,

298
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,100
why don't you go to my family with me?

299
00:13:32,860 --> 00:13:33,500
I'll ask people

300
00:13:33,700 --> 00:13:35,140
to investigate your background

301
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,060
and protect you forever.

302
00:13:39,020 --> 00:13:39,660
Are you pretending

303
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,060
not knowing my feelings for you,

304
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:42,580
or

305
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,700
you already have someone you like?

306
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,380
I don't mean to force you.

307
00:13:48,020 --> 00:13:49,460
I just want you to know

308
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:51,220
that as long as you are willing to,

309
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:52,660
I'll always be here for you.

310
00:13:55,820 --> 00:13:57,860
Are these all fake?

311
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:04,490
Ridiculous.

312
00:14:05,980 --> 00:14:07,100
Am I the only one

313
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,700
who believed it?

314
00:14:43,370 --> 00:14:43,980
Chong.

315
00:14:44,940 --> 00:14:46,220
Go find Zhuwan.

316
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,380
Zhuwan, listen to me.

317
00:15:03,530 --> 00:15:04,220
Let go of me!

318
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:05,260
I don't want to see you.

319
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,380
Let go of me.

320
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:06,980
I can let go.

321
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,370
Let me finish first.

322
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:11,620
What do you want to say?

323
00:15:12,340 --> 00:15:13,580
Tell me how you two worked together

324
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,660
to lie to me?

325
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,730
Hong and I

326
00:15:20,420 --> 00:15:20,940
did lie to you.

327
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:22,060
It was our fault.

328
00:15:22,580 --> 00:15:23,980
I thought I was meticulous,

329
00:15:24,380 --> 00:15:26,540
but I failed to care about your feelings.

330
00:15:28,530 --> 00:15:29,900
I apologize.

331
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:32,900
But we did this

332
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:35,380
for your safety.

333
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:39,180
For my safety?

334
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:42,610
Have you ever asked me

335
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,220
if I would like

336
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:44,860
to be protected in this way?

337
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:48,780
I always thought

338
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:50,300
we were close.

339
00:15:50,540 --> 00:15:52,060
There shouldn't have been such a gap.

340
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:53,700
I didn't expect

341
00:15:55,450 --> 00:15:56,740
that I was too confident.

342
00:15:57,060 --> 00:15:57,740
Zhuwan.

343
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:59,180
But I'm sincere to you.

344
00:15:59,340 --> 00:16:00,220
Murong Chong!

345
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:02,980
It's over.

346
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:04,860
Let it end here.

347
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:10,860
Whether you're sincere or not...

348
00:16:33,140 --> 00:16:33,860
Hong.

349
00:16:34,340 --> 00:16:35,180
Have you seen Zhuwan?

350
00:16:35,540 --> 00:16:36,460
No.

351
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,380
Did she leave?

352
00:16:40,610 --> 00:16:42,060
She doesn't want to forgive me.

353
00:16:42,340 --> 00:16:43,380
Do you think Zhuwan

354
00:16:43,540 --> 00:16:44,410
goes back to Mount Jiuju?

355
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:46,700
It's so chaotic outside.

356
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:48,300
Zhuwan won't run around.

357
00:16:48,500 --> 00:16:49,340
Maybe we can catch up with her

358
00:16:49,500 --> 00:16:50,420
if we set off now.

359
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,300
Okay.

360
00:16:51,530 --> 00:16:52,220
Let's go.

361
00:16:52,460 --> 00:16:53,460
Let's go.

362
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:08,540
[Tomb of my dearest sister Xi You from Brother Xi Feng]

363
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,380
Xi You.

364
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:08,540
I'm sorry.

365
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:12,380
I'll catch Murong Chong

366
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,260
and kill him

367
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:16,660
to avenge you.

368
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,060
Who are you?

369
00:17:48,340 --> 00:17:49,300
Father?

370
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,060
Father.

371
00:17:55,180 --> 00:17:57,090
Why are you still alive?

372
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:01,090
Wei,

373
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,580
I have my reasons.

374
00:18:04,220 --> 00:18:04,940
Father,

375
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,860
what do you mean?

376
00:18:07,140 --> 00:18:09,460
I pretended to die to pass the tile of Chief to Murong Chong.

377
00:18:09,930 --> 00:18:11,540
It's all for you.

378
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,180
Only when he became the Chief,

379
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:14,130
all the attention

380
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:15,100
from all sets

381
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:16,940
would be paid on him.

382
00:18:17,260 --> 00:18:18,460
And you

383
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:20,850
will have time and energy

384
00:18:21,250 --> 00:18:23,570
to practice the Manual.

385
00:18:23,860 --> 00:18:24,580
Father,

386
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:26,620
I thought you didn't like me,

387
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,420
and you liked Chong more.

388
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:30,460
I didn't expect

389
00:18:31,140 --> 00:18:32,540
that you did so much

390
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:34,290
to cultivate me.

391
00:18:34,660 --> 00:18:35,820
Silly boy.

392
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:37,180
If I didn't like you,

393
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:38,980
why would I hand the Manual

394
00:18:39,130 --> 00:18:40,980
to you?

395
00:18:41,340 --> 00:18:42,260
Father.

396
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,420
I've absorbed

397
00:18:44,570 --> 00:18:46,460
lots of martial arts skills from famous masters.

398
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:48,740
My power has improved a lot.

399
00:18:49,850 --> 00:18:51,220
I know.

400
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,420
But I didn't expect

401
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,540
that Murong Chong got the Manual

402
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:58,500
by chance.

403
00:18:58,820 --> 00:18:59,930
Besides,

404
00:19:01,700 --> 00:19:03,860
he's improved a lot too.

405
00:19:05,420 --> 00:19:06,140
Father.

406
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,420
Don't worry.

407
00:19:08,330 --> 00:19:09,900
I'll practice harder

408
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,940
and surpass Murong Chong as soon as possible.

409
00:19:12,330 --> 00:19:14,340
I'm so proud

410
00:19:15,580 --> 00:19:17,420
to have a son like you.

411
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:19,220
But...

412
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:21,340
you must take good care

413
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:22,900
of yourself

414
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:24,500
when you practice the Divine Art of Shanhai.

415
00:19:25,660 --> 00:19:28,420
I will protect you in secret.

416
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,220
Father.

417
00:19:39,180 --> 00:19:40,180
Hello, bro.

418
00:19:40,460 --> 00:19:42,660
Do you know the Zhou family in Jian'an City?

419
00:19:43,010 --> 00:19:44,020
Zhou family?

420
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,620
More than a decade ago,

421
00:19:45,620 --> 00:19:47,180
there was a Zhou family in Jian'an City.

422
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:48,250
What about now?

423
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:51,020
The whole Zhou family was executed.

424
00:19:52,060 --> 00:19:53,900
No one survived?

425
00:19:54,100 --> 00:19:55,660
I don't know.

426
00:19:56,660 --> 00:19:57,780
Sir,

427
00:19:58,180 --> 00:19:59,500
I've heard about

428
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:00,740
the Zhou family before.

429
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,260
Tell me more please.

430
00:20:02,530 --> 00:20:03,500
It's said that

431
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:05,420
no one survived back then.

432
00:20:05,780 --> 00:20:07,660
But as far as I know,

433
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:09,460
there's one alive.

434
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,370
Where is he now?

435
00:20:14,930 --> 00:20:17,660
[Zhou Lin]

436
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,730
Here, right here.

437
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,060
You can find him

438
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:21,060
just three blocks from here.

439
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,540
Thank you, bro.

440
00:20:33,460 --> 00:20:34,340
Stop!

441
00:20:35,220 --> 00:20:35,940
This...

442
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:37,340
Go.

443
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:44,100
Stop!

444
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:45,900
Be careful.

445
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,180
What's wrong with you?

446
00:20:48,740 --> 00:20:49,700
The wheels are broken.

447
00:20:50,060 --> 00:20:51,020
The trolley doesn't work well.

448
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:51,780
I'm sorry.

449
00:20:51,980 --> 00:20:52,500
Push it away.

450
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:57,900
Where is...

451
00:21:01,740 --> 00:21:02,100
Zhuwan.

452
00:21:02,260 --> 00:21:02,900
Zhuwan.

453
00:21:03,340 --> 00:21:04,220
Zhuwan.

454
00:21:04,530 --> 00:21:05,060
Zhuwan.

455
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,570
Zhuwan didn't return to Mount Jiuju.

456
00:21:10,060 --> 00:21:10,660
Where is she now?

457
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,660
Zhuwan is mature and sensible.

458
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,810
She'll be back soon.

459
00:21:16,060 --> 00:21:16,780
No.

460
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,300
I'm really worried.

461
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,420
I have to find her.

462
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:20,980
I'll go with you.

463
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:50,500
Is it the news about Zhuwan?

464
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:52,920
[Miss Zhuwan is safe now. She's working hard on her background. Please rest assured.]

465
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:55,860
Hong,

466
00:21:56,500 --> 00:21:58,260
we don't have to worry about Zhuwan.

467
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,540
She's fine now.

468
00:21:59,740 --> 00:22:01,660
She's investigating her background.

469
00:22:02,340 --> 00:22:03,100
Zhuwan is smart.

470
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:04,900
She will be safe.

471
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:06,940
Let's wait for her here.

472
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:22,900
I heard that Mount Jiuju is very magical.

473
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,140
It can only be seen

474
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,380
at a specific time.

475
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,250
Is it true?

476
00:22:30,780 --> 00:22:32,220
Miss Yao is better now.

477
00:22:32,540 --> 00:22:33,540
Governor Fu told me

478
00:22:33,810 --> 00:22:34,890
to continue with my own business.

479
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:36,900
It's your turn to

480
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:37,810
take care of Miss Fu Yao.

481
00:22:38,140 --> 00:22:39,140
I don't know how.

482
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,940
Miss Fu Yao can take care of herself.

483
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,900
You're not required

484
00:22:43,100 --> 00:22:43,940
to cook.

485
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,820
You just need to

486
00:22:44,970 --> 00:22:45,740
keep her safe.

487
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:46,940
It won't be hard for you.

488
00:22:47,300 --> 00:22:48,260
All right.

489
00:22:49,940 --> 00:22:51,700
You're always like this every day. Are you tired?

490
00:22:52,100 --> 00:22:53,020
No.

491
00:23:09,900 --> 00:23:10,540
Hong.

492
00:23:11,500 --> 00:23:12,900
Meng Tang just sent a message

493
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,860
and said Yao is fine now.

494
00:23:15,860 --> 00:23:16,420
That's good.

495
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:17,460
Yao is fine.

496
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,300
You can rest assured now.

497
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,340
Aren't you tired standing all the time?

498
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:34,940
Sit down and rest.

499
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,580
I'm talking to you.

500
00:23:39,980 --> 00:23:41,180
Can you hear me?

501
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,340
Yes, I can.

502
00:23:44,260 --> 00:23:44,780
Since you can hear me,

503
00:23:44,980 --> 00:23:46,580
why didn't you answer me?

504
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:50,340
There are only the two of us here.

505
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:51,700
But you didn't answer me.

506
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,220
I'm too bored.

507
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:55,300
What should I do?

508
00:23:58,460 --> 00:23:59,500
Brother Hong, Chong,

509
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,300
and Zhuwan are all at the Mount Jiuju.

510
00:24:02,020 --> 00:24:03,700
It's very dangerous there.

511
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:06,260
How can I be at ease?

512
00:24:07,060 --> 00:24:07,700
Don't

513
00:24:07,900 --> 00:24:09,140
get into any trouble!

514
00:24:11,260 --> 00:24:12,860
I'm still young. I didn't mean it.

515
00:24:13,180 --> 00:24:13,940
Dear gods,

516
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:14,980
don't take it seriously.

517
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,220
Please bless my brother,

518
00:24:16,370 --> 00:24:17,100
Chong and Zhuwan

519
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,540
to be safe.

520
00:24:18,860 --> 00:24:20,540
Please.

521
00:24:20,860 --> 00:24:21,580
They're safe.

522
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:25,660
You...

523
00:24:29,220 --> 00:24:30,220
Will you die

524
00:24:30,420 --> 00:24:31,290
if you say more words every time?

525
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:33,700
I won't die.

526
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:37,460
Forget it.

527
00:24:37,900 --> 00:24:38,940
You're a nerd.

528
00:24:39,460 --> 00:24:40,380
I won't talk to you.

529
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:48,340
Both of us

530
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:49,900
have practiced the Manual.

531
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,740
But these two manuals

532
00:24:52,140 --> 00:24:53,260
seems to have nothing to do with each other.

533
00:24:53,620 --> 00:24:54,500
How about

534
00:24:55,220 --> 00:24:56,930
combining our skills?

535
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:10,260
It doesn't work.

536
00:25:11,210 --> 00:25:12,460
The two of us have opposite skills,

537
00:25:12,860 --> 00:25:13,780
and our internal force is in conflict.

538
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:15,780
It can't merge at all.

539
00:25:17,090 --> 00:25:18,260
When I was injured,

540
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,300
Zhuwan looked up the ancient books.

541
00:25:21,090 --> 00:25:22,100
Why don't we find clues

542
00:25:22,300 --> 00:25:23,180
from the ancient books too?

543
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,290
Okay.

544
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,660
Let's go.

545
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:23,900
Hello, is this the Zhou family?

546
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:25,300
Madam?

547
00:26:25,780 --> 00:26:26,900
What did you address me?

548
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:27,820
You look alike her.

549
00:26:28,660 --> 00:26:30,100
You're just like Her Ladyship.

550
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:34,780
You are Miss Zhou?

551
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,660
Are you from the Zhou family?

552
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,860
[Token]

553
00:26:46,180 --> 00:26:48,060
This is the token of the Zhou family.

554
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:51,570
[Token]

555
00:26:57,900 --> 00:26:59,780
I'm here to look into my background.

556
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,140
What happened back then?

557
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:03,740
Why was the Zhou family exterminated?

558
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:05,090
The Zhou family was doing the cloth business

559
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,770
for generations.

560
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,250
Actually,

561
00:27:08,740 --> 00:27:09,930
the Zhou family

562
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,300
was doing the business of weapons in secret.

563
00:27:13,980 --> 00:27:15,740
Why did they do it secretly?

564
00:27:16,140 --> 00:27:17,290
The Zhou family did this

565
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,700
to hide the secret

566
00:27:19,860 --> 00:27:21,180
they had been keeping for generations.

567
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,820
The Zhou family

568
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,690
had Cheng Qianyi's sword, Immortality.

569
00:27:25,940 --> 00:27:27,820
Cheng Qianyi's sword, Immortality?

570
00:27:28,060 --> 00:27:28,780
Yes.

571
00:27:29,180 --> 00:27:30,420
Mr. Cheng Qianyi

572
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,620
not only left

573
00:27:31,770 --> 00:27:33,020
the Shanhai Secret Manuals,

574
00:27:33,500 --> 00:27:35,500
but alsot the sword, Immortality.

575
00:27:35,860 --> 00:27:37,740
People only know the Shanhai Secret Manuals.

576
00:27:37,900 --> 00:27:40,500
But they know little about the sword, Immortality.

577
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:41,980
That's why

578
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,300
the Zhou family could

579
00:27:43,460 --> 00:27:45,340
have lived a peaceful life for so many years.

580
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:46,900
Until that day,

581
00:27:47,620 --> 00:27:48,940
that man broke into the Zhou family

582
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:50,860
and robbed the sword.

583
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:53,180
The leader of the Zhou family wouldn't give in,

584
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:55,500
and was brutally killed.

585
00:27:55,860 --> 00:27:57,900
People of Zhou family fought hard

586
00:27:58,460 --> 00:28:00,500
but were all killed.

587
00:28:01,180 --> 00:28:02,620
Luckily,

588
00:28:03,460 --> 00:28:04,660
I was out that day,

589
00:28:05,180 --> 00:28:06,940
so I survived.

590
00:28:11,660 --> 00:28:12,460
Wait a moment.

591
00:28:12,820 --> 00:28:13,700
Here is a sachet

592
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,900
left by Her Ladyship.

593
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,460
Wait for me.

594
00:28:21,620 --> 00:28:22,340
Why don't I

595
00:28:22,500 --> 00:28:23,890
remember this?

596
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:41,580
You two

597
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,100
must be careful.

598
00:28:43,460 --> 00:28:44,700
Don't be careless

599
00:28:45,220 --> 00:28:46,380
in case you will ruin the plan.

600
00:28:46,860 --> 00:28:47,420
Yes.

601
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:54,980
I didn't expect us

602
00:29:55,140 --> 00:29:56,540
to be troubled by a meal.

603
00:29:59,540 --> 00:30:00,380
Here you are.

604
00:30:02,260 --> 00:30:03,020
I'd better go to the mountain

605
00:30:03,180 --> 00:30:04,500
and find some wild fruits.

606
00:30:06,010 --> 00:30:07,020
I'll clean up in the kitchen.

607
00:30:07,140 --> 00:30:07,900
Okay.

608
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:11,250
You can keep it.

609
00:30:51,740 --> 00:30:52,860
Meng Tang?

610
00:30:54,460 --> 00:30:55,660
Master Chong.

611
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:03,370
Governor Fu.

612
00:31:05,140 --> 00:31:06,260
Why did you get hurt like this?

613
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,340
There're just

614
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,540
some scratches.

615
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,380
Hong, don't worry.

616
00:31:11,770 --> 00:31:12,380
I've checked

617
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,460
for Meng Tang.

618
00:31:13,780 --> 00:31:14,780
He didn't hurt his bones.

619
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:15,660
I also used my internal force

620
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,010
to help him recover a bit.

621
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,620
What happened?

622
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:22,860
I've contacted the former subordinates in Jian'an City.

623
00:31:23,380 --> 00:31:24,380
I don't know where Murong Wei

624
00:31:24,540 --> 00:31:25,700
got the news and rushed there.

625
00:31:26,020 --> 00:31:27,660
My martial arts is not as good as his, so I was hurt by him.

626
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:28,570
I'm afraid I can't hide

627
00:31:28,740 --> 00:31:30,220
my fake death anymore.

628
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:31,420
We can't meet

629
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:33,140
Fu's former subordinates again.

630
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:34,380
I need to go down the mountain.

631
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:36,140
The Fu's former subordinates can't be exposed.

632
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,220
Hong.

633
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,580
Murong Wei and Fu Sou

634
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,900
knew Meng Tang was alive,

635
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:40,900
they must have set a trap

636
00:31:41,100 --> 00:31:42,060
and waited for you to fall into it.

637
00:31:42,300 --> 00:31:42,860
You can't go.

638
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:43,540
Yes.

639
00:31:43,740 --> 00:31:44,820
Those former subordinates are safe for now.

640
00:31:44,940 --> 00:31:45,980
Please calm down, Governor Fu.

641
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:48,820
Besides, Meng Tang needs rest.

642
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:50,300
Let's go inside first.

643
00:31:52,900 --> 00:31:54,260
Yes. I was too impatient.

644
00:31:55,460 --> 00:31:56,300
Let's go.

645
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,420
Master's wooden box

646
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:56,020
has never been opened.

647
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:57,540
It can't be broken by the external force.

648
00:32:57,860 --> 00:32:59,180
What exactly is in it?
