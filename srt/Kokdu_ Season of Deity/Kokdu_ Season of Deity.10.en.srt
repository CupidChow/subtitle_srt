00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:02,750
(Episode 10)

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,780
Hey, you son of a bitch!

3
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,150
You crazy bastard! How dare you report me to the police?

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:19,250
The police will be here soon.

5
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:22,090
I'll be leaving the country soon.

6
00:00:22,090 --> 00:00:24,480
Have a nice journey.

7
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:12,710
Did the leader of the Black Bear Gang freeze to death?

8
00:01:12,710 --> 00:01:15,230
That's how Choe Gwang-mo, who I was investigating, died.

9
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:19,050
They're not the only ones who froze to death.

10
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,320
Yun Jeong-jin who denied the violence he committed; Jo Bong-pil, who harmed my descendants with the dope;

11
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:21,480
(Jo Bong-pil)
Yun Jeong-jin who denied the violence he committed; Jo Bong-pil, who harmed my descendants with the dope;

12
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:22,210
Yun Jeong-jin who denied the violence he committed; Jo Bong-pil, who harmed my descendants with the dope;

13
00:01:22,210 --> 00:01:22,860
they froze to death in all kinds of ways.

14
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,890
(Bak Gwang-cheol)
they froze to death in all kinds of ways.

15
00:01:24,890 --> 00:01:25,680
they froze to death in all kinds of ways.

16
00:01:25,700 --> 00:01:27,160
Then, the Wide Area Search Team thinks it's a serial killing?
(Baek Du-sik)

17
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:29,880
Then, the Wide Area Search Team thinks it's a serial killing?

18
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,490
They're all dead in the same way, so they're considered as victims of a serial killing for now.

19
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,830
But,

20
00:01:36,830 --> 00:01:40,620
do the victims have something in common with each other?

21
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:44,270
(Photos of the victims of the 1st to 5th cases)

22
00:01:44,270 --> 00:01:45,800
Can't you tell?
(Photos of the victims of the 1st to 5th cases)

23
00:01:45,800 --> 00:01:47,850
You know that they are scums when looking at them.

24
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:49,400
It's like they were punished by God.

25
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,400
They're all bastards who deserve to die.

26
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,340
That's why we call it the "God's Wrath" murder case.

27
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:58,700
There is no such thing as a person who deserves to die.

28
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:07,680
There's an eyewitness to the murder of the Black Bear Gang, right?

29
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:09,110
His name is Ma Sang-Chen.

30
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,770
He was our informant in the Black Bear Gang.

31
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,660
He almost died there that day.

32
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:22,480
He survived thanks to the killer of the “God’s Wrath”,

33
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,570
although he hasn't woken up yet.

34
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:32,690
I don't think we were called here to wake him up.

35
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:36,380
Are they suspecting Do Jin-woo?

36
00:02:36,380 --> 00:02:38,870
They want to start the investigation there rather than suspect.

37
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,130
But they're afraid of Bulhwa Company.

38
00:02:41,130 --> 00:02:46,480
That's why they think it's better to get someone who have experience.

39
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,910
Is that why they called us?

40
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:52,940
We need someone who can put a bell on this cat named Do Jin-woo.

41
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:01,570
So what will happen if you're not good enough?

42
00:03:01,570 --> 00:03:05,330
Even people who aren’t good enough will feel happy when they look at each other.

43
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:13,230
I think it's good to be happy all day.

44
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:19,770
Then you agree?

45
00:03:19,770 --> 00:03:22,800
You agree to live with me?

46
00:03:30,290 --> 00:03:32,700
Let's go out and have fun.

47
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:34,470
Where are you going?

48
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:38,760
To take a walk? There are so many people watching.

49
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,850
Although the plutocrat's walk will be noticed by the world.

50
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:42,940
But when a plutocrat goes shopping, he won't be noticed.

51
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:44,230
Because that’s their daily life.

52
00:03:44,230 --> 00:03:45,410
Why are you suddenly going shopping?

53
00:03:45,410 --> 00:03:47,130
A man and a woman together, happily all day long.

54
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,980
Doing this and that too.

55
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:50,400
They need this and that too.

56
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:52,160
Stop!

57
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:54,950
I’ve stopped. I’ve stopped.

58
00:03:54,950 --> 00:03:58,880
What are we going to do happily all day now?

59
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:02,850
Loving each other.

60
00:04:04,670 --> 00:04:06,960
I don't think so.

61
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
It should be private education.

62
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:10,730
What? Educate a person at this age?

63
00:04:12,060 --> 00:04:13,610
Protect.

64
00:04:13,610 --> 00:04:14,620
What?

65
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:17,519
Didn't you say you'd protect me all day?

66
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,860
Protected fair trade. I like that.

67
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:23,910
How to say that? Is it fashionable?

68
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:26,040
Fashionable? What?

69
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,500
For capitalism, trade is

70
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:29,050
never going to be fair.

71
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:31,340
Fair trade, that's nonsense.

72
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:32,940
It's an oxymoron.

73
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,970
I see.

74
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,720
Right.

75
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,450
So trade is so dangerous.

76
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,880
Right.

77
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:41,590
It seems that contracts are really important.

78
00:04:41,590 --> 00:04:44,200
Contracts? What kind of contracts?

79
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,990
The marriage contract?

80
00:04:45,990 --> 00:04:50,200
You're in such a hurry? I need to be mentally prepared.

81
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:54,230
When you get married, you don't need a contract, you need an application form.

82
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:56,270
What you need is not the mental preparation, but a seal.

83
00:04:56,270 --> 00:04:58,270
Today is weekend. The district office is closed.

84
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,200
And I'm talking about the protection contract.

85
00:05:01,200 --> 00:05:06,710
Protection contract? We’ve agreed to live together, and now you’re talking about protection.

86
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:08,360
I've said it many times.

87
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:10,350
My time is short in this world, Miss.

88
00:05:10,350 --> 00:05:12,350
How can I go backwards when I can't even have much time to move forward?

89
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,650
Then let's pretend that nothing has happened.

90
00:05:13,650 --> 00:05:14,960
Damn it.

91
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm the only one who suffer losses.

92
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:22,680
You think signing a contract is good for you, don't you?

93
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,290
I’m saying it myself, because I don’t want you to think I’m praising myself.

94
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:28,160
During the period of Japanese imperialism,

95
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,410
in the rice and bean market, there was a man who was very good at grain business, Ban Bok-chang.

96
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,840
He was so good that people said he was possessed by a god.

97
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,150
The god in his body was me.

98
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:38,950
I'm good at writing contracts.

99
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:42,530
What's wrong with you?

100
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,170
Any problem?

101
00:05:44,170 --> 00:05:46,170
It's the lawyer's business.

102
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,340
What?

103
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:49,340
There are so many lawyers in Bulhwa Company.

104
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:51,840
They should be good at writing contracts, right?

105
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,100
I haven’t thought about that.

106
00:05:54,100 --> 00:05:55,650
Why did you suddenly mention that guy?

107
00:05:55,650 --> 00:05:57,590
Ok Shin will never help with that.

108
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:03,100
Forget it, each of us think of three conditions in a fair manner.

109
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:05,450
Three? Why three?

110
00:06:06,470 --> 00:06:09,550
As long as we’re Korean, of course it's a three-game match.

111
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,050
I don't care if it's a three game or a bumpy, I won't sign a contract.
(Note: "Bumpy" and "Three Games" are homophones.)

112
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:16,230
Contact me when you're ready.

113
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:21,930
Wait, wait, wait, I haven’t finished my words yet, hey, hey!

114
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,110
I'm the only one who suffer losses.

115
00:06:32,510 --> 00:06:33,900
Well…

116
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:37,300
President, why do you have to drive yourself.

117
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:41,409
You can't talk about family matters in a place where other people can hear you.

118
00:06:41,409 --> 00:06:43,760
I can drive.

119
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:47,330
It's a very expensive car. How dare you touch my car?

120
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,630
Anyway, we're going to live together, so I'll tell you in advance.

121
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:55,409
I don't like it when people touch my stuff.

122
00:06:57,010 --> 00:07:00,510
One Deity is enough.

123
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,920
Why are you so scared?

124
00:07:04,920 --> 00:07:07,450
We two should both be careful.

125
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:10,960
So from now on, I have to be careful with…

126
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,260
-Stuffs… - Husband's family?

127
00:07:13,260 --> 00:07:16,040
What? Why was the topic changed there?

128
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:19,340
It’s said the life in husband's family is more difficult than anything else.

129
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:24,380
I heard that the brother-in-law and the sister-in-law are on a completely different level.

130
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:28,230
Deity didn't even tell me about it in advance.

131
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:30,750
That's right.

132
00:07:31,910 --> 00:07:33,800
If you go to the house in Seoul,

133
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:36,600
you'll find the exact same structure as here.

134
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:40,120
That's why you have to remove everything from here.

135
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,159
Even every screw, every paper towel, every grain of dust, and all of it intact.

136
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,800
Now you heard me?

137
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,970
We'll move everything as it is, as it is.

138
00:07:47,970 --> 00:07:51,340
President, I've taken all the photos of the second floor.

139
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:53,340
Okay, let's go.

140
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:56,200
Why do I have to suffer so much?

141
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,030
We'll move it as it is, as it is.

142
00:07:58,030 --> 00:07:59,880
As it is.

143
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:38,130
Okay.

144
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:42,840
Come on, everyone’s here.

145
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:52,650
You really can't see a single flaw.

146
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:55,900
Lord Deity, is that enough?

147
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:57,230
No.

148
00:08:57,230 --> 00:08:58,510
What?

149
00:08:58,510 --> 00:08:59,950
Why?

150
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:03,020
Something is not in this picture, but it's in this house.

151
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:05,170
What's that?

152
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,960
This useless, stupid guy,

153
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,700
has no sense of perspective,

154
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:16,890
who brought things to this point.

155
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,890
This brainless bastard.

156
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:19,140
You useless!

157
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,500
What are you going to do to me if I don't stop?

158
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:23,530
What can you do to me if I yell?

159
00:09:23,530 --> 00:09:25,210
If you hadn't caused trouble in the first place

160
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:27,480
would I have done this?

161
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:29,430
Contract. Contract.

162
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:31,000
Keeping secrets.

163
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:32,700
Paragraph 3, article 5,

164
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:35,230
everything you see and hear in this house is confidential.

165
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,050
Do you understand?

166
00:09:36,050 --> 00:09:36,520
Dismissed! Dismissed!

167
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:38,370
Decide yourselves how much the fine is.

168
00:09:38,370 --> 00:09:41,050
What secret? What do you mean by that?

169
00:09:41,050 --> 00:09:43,270
-Are you saying I'm mentally ill? -Dismiss!

170
00:09:43,270 --> 00:09:47,150
It’s said that it's never easy to change one’s nature.

171
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:50,310
Did you have to say that to me in front of all those people?

172
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:52,490
I'm so nervous.

173
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,090
Tomorrow Han Gye-jeol is coming to live with us.

174
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:57,270
I don't know how I'll make a fool of myself in front of her.

175
00:09:57,270 --> 00:09:59,270
I don't know if she'll find it out or not.

176
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:01,690
I'm so worried that I can't sleep at night.

177
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:04,500
So you can't sleep at night?

178
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:08,220
That's why you slept so much during the day.

179
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:11,510
I sleep during the day? What's that nonsense?

180
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,160
You slept all day, so you didn't do anything.

181
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,860
You didn't do anything, so you didn't find the list.

182
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:22,820
The list? Is that why I've been tormented?

183
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:24,840
If you have a question, just say so.

184
00:10:24,840 --> 00:10:28,950
Do you have to make me embarrassed in front of all those people?

185
00:10:28,950 --> 00:10:31,620
Bosses are meant to make people feel uncomfortable.

186
00:10:31,620 --> 00:10:34,870
Leadership skills that can make employees grow uncomfortable.

187
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,550
Who said this uncomfortable crap?

188
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:42,330
Where did you hear my speech again?

189
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,120
Damn video recommendation. I have to quit the YouTube.

190
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:52,550
Lord Deity.

191
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:56,910
The list doesn't have a shelf life.

192
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:58,620
If you're patient...

193
00:10:58,620 --> 00:11:03,750
The list doesn't have a shelf life, but I do.

194
00:11:05,630 --> 00:11:10,990
I need to get this done before I expire.

195
00:11:13,930 --> 00:11:17,340
I know. I'll do everything I can to find it.

196
00:11:17,340 --> 00:11:20,360
You have to look for it. Don't sleep all the time.

197
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:22,800
How can you spend all day...

198
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:28,290
No one will ring the doorbell of this house.

199
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:32,170
Han Gye-jeol, isn't she coming tomorrow?

200
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:35,690
I haven't written the contract yet. It's hard for me.

201
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:42,190
President, the employee who was here just now said he wanted to talk to you about something.

202
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:47,370
I'm sorry, I just remembered something I haven't done yet.

203
00:11:47,370 --> 00:11:49,050
What is it?

204
00:11:51,880 --> 00:11:53,830
I have something to leave.

205
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:55,470
Okay, just give it to me and go.

206
00:11:55,470 --> 00:11:57,200
I'm sorry.

207
00:11:59,730 --> 00:12:00,910
What are you doing now?

208
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,770
Well…

209
00:12:02,770 --> 00:12:04,960
Because he said even a speck of dust, a piece of paper towel

210
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,580
must be moved intact.

211
00:12:06,580 --> 00:12:08,100
So that's it.

212
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,650
You're doing a good job. Go now.

213
00:12:09,650 --> 00:12:11,040
I'll leave now.

214
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,690
Just leave.

215
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:19,270
So obedient to everything...

216
00:12:19,270 --> 00:12:20,860
What?

217
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:22,120
Jang Mi… sun.

218
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:22,620
(Jang Mi-sun(58))
Jang Mi… sun.

219
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:23,750
(Jang Mi-sun(58))

220
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,210
How did this come out of there?

221
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:30,700
These are Do Jin-woo's diaries.

222
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,420
Gak Shin, why are there so many words?

223
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,910
How can I memorize all these? So many words.

224
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,380
Should we send this list to the media right away?

225
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:43,050
No.

226
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:44,920
The capital and the media are all in cahoots.

227
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,020
If we send it to the media, it will go straight into the hands of Kim Pil-soo.

228
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,940
Then this list will disappear forever.

229
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:55,950
Lord Deity, why don’t we make it public on my YouTube channel

230
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:59,590
just like last time.

231
00:12:59,590 --> 00:13:01,280
You know how fast it was spreading.

232
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,290
If this list spreads,

233
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:06,460
Kim Pil-soo will threaten the people on the list first.

234
00:13:08,970 --> 00:13:11,990
Meet with them in private first.

235
00:13:11,990 --> 00:13:14,310
What happened in Pilseong Hospital,

236
00:13:14,310 --> 00:13:16,910
what do they have in common,

237
00:13:16,910 --> 00:13:18,290
let's get this first.

238
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,800
-Okay. -Okay.

239
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:26,550
The second gift should be a serious one.

240
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,440
So, what did you find out about the serial killing case?

241
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,880
I've been following the Wide Area Search Team,

242
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:41,300
but they always go to Myeongin University Hospital.

243
00:13:41,300 --> 00:13:43,700
Why did they go to Myeongin University Hospital? Who did they see?

244
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:43,910
(Chairman Kim Pil-soo)
Why did they go to Myeongin University Hospital? Who did they see?

245
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,690
I don't know yet.
(Chairman Kim Pil-soo)

246
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:46,200
I followed them to the 8th floor.
(Chairman Kim Pil-soo)

247
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,580
I followed them to the 8th floor.

248
00:13:47,580 --> 00:13:50,670
It said it was a controlled area. I couldn't get in.

249
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:53,020
Control is meant to be broken.

250
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:57,370
The day after tomorrow, go see the chief of internal medicine, I Sang-jae. He'll help you.

251
00:13:57,370 --> 00:14:00,170
Chief I Sang-jae. Okay.

252
00:14:00,170 --> 00:14:02,960
No matter what those guys in the Wide Area Search Team are hiding, we must find out quickly.

253
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,540
I could relax a bit only if I reveal at least one.

254
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,420
Fine.

255
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,290
(Seoul Myeongin University Hospital)
Fine.

256
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:09,700
(Seoul Myeongin University Hospital)

257
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:16,140
You haven't decided yet? Why? Are you afraid of danger?

258
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:21,120
The only wish of my only family is for me to live a long life as a police.

259
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,230
If you want your life as a cop to be a long one...

260
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:26,610
Then this job looks dangerous.

261
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:33,510
In this community, the only way to make a name for yourself is to catch a big guy.

262
00:14:33,510 --> 00:14:35,400
The only way to live a long life is to get ahead.

263
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:38,020
Don't you know anything about big horses never die?

264
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,620
Is the hospital you're going to really credible?

265
00:15:06,620 --> 00:15:09,060
Will they really pay those salaries?

266
00:15:09,060 --> 00:15:11,850
Of course, because it's a new hospital.

267
00:15:11,850 --> 00:15:13,540
So it will pay a little more.

268
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,340
Give me the name and phone number of the hospital.

269
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:23,180
Why do you need the number?

270
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,640
You want to date a hospital?

271
00:15:24,640 --> 00:15:26,120
I have to do research.

272
00:15:26,120 --> 00:15:27,410
What if it's just an illegal company under the guise of a hospital?

273
00:15:27,410 --> 00:15:28,930
You might be taken to shrimping.

274
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:30,730
Me? Shrimping?

275
00:15:30,730 --> 00:15:33,310
It’s faster to let the shrimp catch me.

276
00:15:36,410 --> 00:15:40,230
Sis, why do you keep talking in circles?

277
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:45,800
Are you going to sit there all the time?

278
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:49,450
Even if we're siblings, you should respect my privacy.

279
00:15:49,450 --> 00:15:51,260
Don’t move.

280
00:15:52,530 --> 00:15:55,760
Why did you buy so much sexy lingerie?

281
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:58,520
You never spend your money on such invisible things.

282
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,380
Why don't you buy me a pair of panties and say something like that?

283
00:16:02,380 --> 00:16:04,640
Get out! Get out!

284
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:07,040
You're not using the hospital as an excuse

285
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:09,710
and going to Seoul to live with a man, right?

286
00:16:11,050 --> 00:16:12,710
No, I'm not.

287
00:16:14,050 --> 00:16:16,540
I'm going to the staff housing.

288
00:16:16,540 --> 00:16:17,910
And it doesn't matter if I'm going to live with a man or not.

289
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:19,320
I'm already in my 30s,

290
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:21,730
do I need your permission?

291
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:23,600
Even if you don't,

292
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,660
the man must have my permission.

293
00:16:25,660 --> 00:16:29,910
Why? Because men know men better?

294
00:16:29,910 --> 00:16:32,470
That's the only way he won't look down on you.

295
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:33,420
What?

296
00:16:33,420 --> 00:16:35,420
Do you think the fathers meet for nothing before the wedding?

297
00:16:35,420 --> 00:16:38,220
They're just showing each other their strengths.

298
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:39,770
You're not a loner, sister.

299
00:16:39,770 --> 00:16:41,380
You have a backer like me.

300
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:44,490
You need to show your strength so that you won't be treated badly.

301
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:54,190
Really? When did my little Chul become so sensible?

302
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:57,410
I'll buy you some cookies in Seoul.

303
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,930
You don't have to buy them for me. I'm probably going to Seoul too.

304
00:17:00,930 --> 00:17:02,400
What about here?

305
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,710
You didn't get fired, did you?

306
00:17:05,710 --> 00:17:07,710
Who would dare fire me?

307
00:17:07,710 --> 00:17:11,740
The Wide Area Search Team wants to invite me over.

308
00:17:13,210 --> 00:17:15,640
There are so many elites on that team.

309
00:17:15,640 --> 00:17:17,890
Why would they need a reckless person like you?

310
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,880
What? Is there a serial murder case?

311
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:21,710
Are they short of hands?

312
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:31,270
What, is it another dangerous case?

313
00:17:31,270 --> 00:17:33,910
Have you forgotten what I said?

314
00:17:33,910 --> 00:17:36,100
I said we need to live a long life, right?

315
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,670
In this world,

316
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,230
the only way to make a name for yourself is to catch the big guy.

317
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:40,830
The only way to live a long life is to get ahead.

318
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,580
You don’t know that the big houses never die.

319
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:44,700
It’s big horses never die, horses.

320
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:47,130
Why did you talk about marijuana in front of a police?
(Note: "Dama" is pronounced the same as "Marijuana")

321
00:17:48,910 --> 00:17:51,700
How can a person like you catch the murderer?

322
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:56,260
You have promised to go?

323
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:57,720
I’ve said that I would consider it.

324
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,660
Consider what? Just say no.

325
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:01,670
I’ve said I would think about it, think.

326
00:18:01,670 --> 00:18:05,540
If you come to Seoul, you're dead.

327
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:49,940
Welcome. This is the first time you've met the housekeeper, Seo Bok-gyeong, right?

328
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,880
What's Nurse Seo doing here?

329
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:00,670
Did Deity hire you here in advance?

330
00:19:00,670 --> 00:19:03,600
Then why didn't you tell me in advance?

331
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:04,960
You quit without even saying anything.

332
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,510
Do you know how sad I was?

333
00:19:06,510 --> 00:19:07,930
Did I do something wrong?

334
00:19:07,930 --> 00:19:09,320
Is this the only relationship between us?

335
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,220
I've been thinking a lot about it myself.

336
00:19:11,220 --> 00:19:12,810
What is there to be sad about?

337
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:16,390
There is life and there is death, there are meets and there are separations, and that's how we all live.

338
00:19:16,390 --> 00:19:21,860
Anyway, welcome to a family that doesn't look like human beings.

339
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:24,320
Not like human beings?

340
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:33,050
I'm suddenly a little nervous after coming here.

341
00:19:33,050 --> 00:19:36,310
Am I doing the right thing now? Why don't I just get out?

342
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:39,700
I always feel regret and want to look back.

343
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:43,270
You don't have eyes in the back of your head because you don't have to look back.

344
00:19:43,270 --> 00:19:45,880
Don't look back all the time. Or you'll grow eyes in the back of your head.

345
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:50,550
I'm glad you're here, sister.

346
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:52,780
You only call me sister in this kind of condition.

347
00:19:52,780 --> 00:19:54,200
Maybe, I can keep calling you sister.

348
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,230
No, call me Gak Shin.

349
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:58,200
What?

350
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,400
And call President I Eung-chul Ok Shin, call me Gak Shin, that’s it.

351
00:20:03,600 --> 00:20:06,260
Ok Shin and Gak Shin…

352
00:20:21,230 --> 00:20:22,640
Have a good rest.

353
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,840
Thank you.

354
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,700
Thank you.

355
00:20:39,850 --> 00:20:41,260
(Deity)

356
00:20:47,260 --> 00:20:49,020
Do you like it?

357
00:20:52,470 --> 00:20:55,300
Why is your table here?

358
00:20:55,300 --> 00:20:59,700
Because next to you, right here, is my place.

359
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:03,100
You guarded my place with four times of the money.

360
00:21:04,920 --> 00:21:07,970
Why did you put this here?

361
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:12,270
Such a gorgeous room is instantly darkened with this.

362
00:21:16,090 --> 00:21:18,200
Is this that meaning?

363
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:21,430
The Yin and the Yang are in harmony with the decoration according to Fengshui.

364
00:21:22,820 --> 00:21:26,040
There is a need to reconcile Yin and Yang alone?

365
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,790
The young man and woman are alone in the same room.

366
00:21:28,790 --> 00:21:30,790
And they will always be together.

367
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:34,050
Your presence here is already a breach of contract

368
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:35,440
What?

369
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:44,620
The Protection Contract.

370
00:21:44,620 --> 00:21:46,550
Han Gye-jeol, hereinafter referred to as Party A.

371
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:49,060
Yes, you must be party A again.

372
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,050
To protect the physical and mental health of Party B, Deity for 24 hours a day.

373
00:21:51,050 --> 00:21:53,200
(Protection contract)
To protect the physical and mental health of Party B, Deity for 24 hours a day.

374
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,050
To protect the physical and mental health of Party B, Deity for 24 hours a day.

375
00:21:54,280 --> 00:21:57,700
In order to protect the life with wit, comply with the following matters:

376
00:21:57,700 --> 00:22:00,940
First, do not enter the room of Party A without permission.

377
00:22:00,940 --> 00:22:02,330
Then, if I get permission, it's okay, right?

378
00:22:02,330 --> 00:22:03,940
That’s easy, passed.

379
00:22:07,180 --> 00:22:10,240
Second, no one is allowed to speak French at home.

380
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:14,260
Why speak French at home when you don't even speak it outside?

381
00:22:14,260 --> 00:22:16,380
Because you don't understand,

382
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:20,590
in order not to be understood by the boarders, people in this kind of family will use French.

383
00:22:20,590 --> 00:22:22,390
Is that so?

384
00:22:22,390 --> 00:22:24,480
I can’t believe that Eung-chul can speak French.

385
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:26,450
He can't even speak Korean well.

386
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,500
Okay, pass.

387
00:22:28,500 --> 00:22:31,570
Third, do not let Party A endure the life of her husband's family.

388
00:22:31,570 --> 00:22:34,200
What is the life of the husband's family?

389
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:41,620
Like calling the brother-in-law to say hello, or preparing for the festival.

390
00:22:41,620 --> 00:22:42,800
Pass, pass.

391
00:22:42,800 --> 00:22:45,300
The world will first know whether Eung-chul is safe or not.

392
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,600
We are the people living together,

393
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,800
why is two-thirds of the contract about someone else?

394
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:50,310
What does it have to do with Eung-chul?

395
00:22:50,310 --> 00:22:51,620
When a woman is in a relationship with a man,

396
00:22:51,620 --> 00:22:53,620
do you think that she can only see that man?

397
00:22:53,620 --> 00:22:57,170
There's always family hanging around behind that man.

398
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,230
Is it Hometown in the Legends?

399
00:22:59,230 --> 00:23:00,940
Why has it suddenly become a horror movie?

400
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,690
A woman's life is like a horror movie.

401
00:23:05,640 --> 00:23:09,430
What era you think we are in! You're so old-fashioned!

402
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:12,470
Then let me see

403
00:23:12,470 --> 00:23:13,840
what the modern contract is like.

404
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,540
Okay.

405
00:23:15,690 --> 00:23:17,200
Let me see.

406
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:24,390
First, no I love you.

407
00:23:24,390 --> 00:23:25,460
Rejected.

408
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,480
Why do you hate confessions so much?

409
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:28,960
Will your ears grow thorns when you hear it?

410
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,680
My heart will hurt.

411
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:34,720
Confession is like a terminal for me.

412
00:23:35,260 --> 00:23:37,830
I have been running hardly toward this goal.

413
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,050
Just like at the moment of crossing the finish line,

414
00:23:41,050 --> 00:23:41,730
a marathon runner's heart can't bear and falls to the ground.

415
00:23:41,730 --> 00:23:42,730
I don't want to live this kind of life anymore.

416
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,690
I want to enjoy flowers, rain and snow along the way.

417
00:23:47,620 --> 00:23:49,280
I want to cherish and enjoy every moment.

418
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:55,120
It seems that confession is the end for boys.

419
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:57,730
For girls, it's the beginning.

420
00:23:58,120 --> 00:23:58,880
So do you hate it?

421
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,020
There's no such thing as liking or hating it.

422
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:02,190
It's not the same.

423
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:03,850
Pass.

424
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:08,150
Second, don't meet other men.

425
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,390
Nope.

426
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:11,990
I told you to write the terms, not the wish list.

427
00:24:13,970 --> 00:24:15,120
Modern people?

428
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:16,950
There was no such life in the Korean era.

429
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,890
Why do you need other men?

430
00:24:18,890 --> 00:24:22,430
You already have me, who is a sexy, rich, smart, cute man, and a sword fighter,

431
00:24:22,430 --> 00:24:24,430
and as kaleidoscope as Biue-Winged Pitta.

432
00:24:25,380 --> 00:24:27,480
Then you might as well send me to the convent.

433
00:24:28,200 --> 00:24:29,540
You want to become a woman of God?

434
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:31,090
I can't stand it.

435
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:41,660
Give me that.

436
00:24:55,700 --> 00:24:56,260
(No meeting with other men in the absence of Deity)

437
00:24:56,260 --> 00:24:57,920
In the absence of Deity,
(No meeting with other men in the absence of Deity)

438
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,850
no meeting with other men.

439
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,570
That's the biggest concession I can make.

440
00:25:04,950 --> 00:25:05,550
Okay.

441
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,570
It's really tiring to live together.

442
00:25:08,230 --> 00:25:10,820
Do you want to live together without paying anything?

443
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,380
Come on, number three.

444
00:25:14,220 --> 00:25:16,070
The third item hasn't been decided yet. Keep it until tomorrow.

445
00:25:16,070 --> 00:25:17,730
There's no such thing as reservation.

446
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:19,050
If you don't say it now, that means no article three.

447
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,360
Just sign it.

448
00:25:21,210 --> 00:25:22,020
I want to keep it.

449
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:23,380
Sign it!

450
00:25:27,610 --> 00:25:37,520
(Party B's name: Deity Party A's name: Han Gye-jeol)

451
00:25:46,800 --> 00:25:49,060
Ah, can we stop training?

452
00:25:49,770 --> 00:25:51,270
Just now when Professor Hwang delivered,

453
00:25:51,270 --> 00:25:53,030
I was so sleepy that I almost fell on the table.

454
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:55,060
Don't you see that I have fallen twice?

455
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,580
Are you a hamster?

456
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,470
Why do you stuff so much food in your mouth?

457
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:01,120
I haven't had a good meal before in order to lose weight.

458
00:26:01,120 --> 00:26:01,970
I feel too bad.

459
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,160
So from now on I'm going to eat well.

460
00:26:04,620 --> 00:26:05,330
What's wrong with you all of a sudden?

461
00:26:06,700 --> 00:26:09,060
What if I were Gim Tae-hui of the Korean Medical University?

462
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:11,540
Anyway, beauty is only temporary.

463
00:26:11,540 --> 00:26:13,060
I've started to be read not to reply.

464
00:26:15,380 --> 00:26:17,110
It's Officer Han Chul, right?

465
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:22,040
How do you know that?

466
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,040
Does the whole world know that I have been ignored?

467
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,590
Have you been ignored by Officer Han?

468
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:28,000
When?

469
00:26:33,160 --> 00:26:34,090
Guk-hwa, don't misunderstand.

470
00:26:34,580 --> 00:26:36,150
I'm not interested in that cop.

471
00:26:36,690 --> 00:26:38,120
We meet just because of work.

472
00:26:38,660 --> 00:26:40,620
But it should be taken seriously because of work.

473
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:42,530
Who does he think he is? How dare he not replying my messages?

474
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,480
Isn’t it very annoying?

475
00:26:46,700 --> 00:26:47,450
I'm sorry.

476
00:26:49,770 --> 00:26:50,240
What's going on?

477
00:26:50,830 --> 00:26:52,090
So it's really you, officer.

478
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,020
I don't even recognize you in that dress.

479
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:57,200
I just attended a friend's wedding.

480
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:58,480
I see.

481
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:02,020
Why are you here?

482
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:06,260
He couldn't get in touch with you, so he found me.

483
00:27:06,260 --> 00:27:06,790
My friend,

484
00:27:06,790 --> 00:27:07,970
where did you leave your phone, my friend?

485
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,290
I left it in the car.

486
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:12,460
I see.

487
00:27:12,460 --> 00:27:13,520
Then I'll leave.

488
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:14,380
Where are you going?

489
00:27:14,980 --> 00:27:17,570
Beautiful people know when to leave in silence.

490
00:27:19,540 --> 00:27:21,000
Handsome young boys are not my type.

491
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:23,180
Aren’t handsome young boys your type?

492
00:27:24,270 --> 00:27:25,270
You fools don't seem to know that.

493
00:27:25,270 --> 00:27:27,320
So I help you.

494
00:27:28,750 --> 00:27:29,750
Have a good day.

495
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:31,790
Have a good day.

496
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:35,550
I'm sorry.

497
00:27:35,980 --> 00:27:37,420
I didn't reply to you in time because of something.

498
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:40,280
I didn't mean to do that.

499
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:40,510
I don't care whether you don't reply or chew gum.

500
00:27:40,510 --> 00:27:42,350
(homophonic joke in Korean)
I don't care whether you don't reply or chew gum.

501
00:27:42,350 --> 00:27:43,300
I'm not interested at all.
(homophonic joke in Korean)

502
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,900
And what's the reason

503
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:47,160
for a busy man like you to come here?

504
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:48,720
Not everything is a failure.

505
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,880
(homophonic joke in Korean)
Not everything is a failure.

506
00:27:52,090 --> 00:27:54,160
That's not what busy means.

507
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,800
I know, I was just joking.

508
00:27:59,910 --> 00:28:01,350
A joke is a joke when it's funny.

509
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:02,670
How can I make you laugh?

510
00:28:04,000 --> 00:28:06,870
I'll do my best to apologize.

511
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,620
Handsome young boy.

512
00:28:15,710 --> 00:28:16,340
That's...

513
00:28:17,880 --> 00:28:18,540
What?

514
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,980
Are you the youngest son of a plutocrat

515
00:28:22,980 --> 00:28:24,480
or the president's nephew?

516
00:28:26,180 --> 00:28:26,820
Who said that?

517
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:31,750
Are you really not?

518
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,270
Do I look expensive?

519
00:28:35,090 --> 00:28:36,350
Is it true that a man should wear a suit?

520
00:28:37,350 --> 00:28:38,190
It's not possible.

521
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:39,880
You’re not expensive.

522
00:28:40,910 --> 00:28:43,450
But you look like you have a backer.

523
00:28:44,030 --> 00:28:44,720
Why?

524
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,550
How can anyone be so regardless of danger

525
00:28:47,150 --> 00:28:48,480
and broad-minded?

526
00:28:49,300 --> 00:28:53,060
So you were disregarding yourself in the case of Professor Bae.

527
00:28:53,590 --> 00:28:55,590
If I hesitate, someone will get hurt.

528
00:28:56,350 --> 00:28:56,880
What?

529
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:58,450
I'm a policeman.

530
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,540
When I see someone with a knife,

531
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,210
if I hesitate, someone will get hurt.

532
00:29:04,570 --> 00:29:06,430
It doesn't matter if you get hurt?

533
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:10,090
If I was worried about such things, I would not be a policeman.

534
00:29:17,360 --> 00:29:18,090
Are you crazy?

535
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:19,620
He said he was not a plutocrat.

536
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,000
Don't be overly concerned.

537
00:29:21,620 --> 00:29:22,910
Can I ask a question too?

538
00:29:24,570 --> 00:29:25,070
Yes.

539
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,660
Miss Tae Jeong-won, why do you live in Yeongpo?

540
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:30,950
Why are you asking this all of a sudden?

541
00:29:31,410 --> 00:29:32,660
Because I'm suddenly curious.

542
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:35,870
Why are the people who are wanted

543
00:29:35,870 --> 00:29:36,990
by the elites of Pilseong Hospital in Yeongpo?

544
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,700
I see that your hometown is not in Yeongpo either.

545
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,940
So now you're wondering why

546
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:44,950
I, who's known as Gim Tae-hui of the Korean Medical University

547
00:29:45,470 --> 00:29:47,970
with my beauty, education, and strength,

548
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,050
who's perfect for everyone,

549
00:29:50,050 --> 00:29:53,090
would stay in the village, right?

550
00:29:53,660 --> 00:29:55,660
You complimented yourself many time in one sentence.

551
00:29:56,130 --> 00:29:57,160
Where can I learn such skills?

552
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,660
I don’t need to learn that.

553
00:29:58,950 --> 00:29:59,900
It's innate.

554
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:03,310
Is there a rule that all good people should be in Seoul?

555
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,470
Then who treats people in Yeongpo when they get sick?

556
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,970
Even if I'm Hua Tuo, it's useless to be far away.

557
00:30:10,630 --> 00:30:12,940
It's better to go to a doctor nearby.

558
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,640
What's wrong? Do you think I'm a hypocrite?

559
00:30:19,910 --> 00:30:20,680
I think you're cool.

560
00:30:35,630 --> 00:30:36,700
I'll serve the soup.

561
00:30:37,630 --> 00:30:38,330
Stop!

562
00:30:41,730 --> 00:30:42,400
I'll do it.

563
00:30:43,030 --> 00:30:46,130
No, you haven't done these things.

564
00:30:47,850 --> 00:30:48,380
So hot.

565
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,190
Annoying.

566
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:53,340
Just do it this way.

567
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:54,890
Okay.

568
00:31:00,690 --> 00:31:02,810
It's said that raising a son is useless.

569
00:31:07,020 --> 00:31:08,210
Dr. Han is a guest.

570
00:31:08,860 --> 00:31:10,470
It's my duty to serve guests.

571
00:31:11,110 --> 00:31:12,840
Let me do my job.

572
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:15,430
You can sit over there.

573
00:31:16,230 --> 00:31:18,750
Han Gye-jeol, come sit here. Let them work.

574
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:23,050
Come here.

575
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:31,980
But why is there seaweed soup? Is it anyone’s birthday?

576
00:31:32,800 --> 00:31:33,480
Your birthday.

577
00:31:34,300 --> 00:31:34,990
Mine?

578
00:31:36,350 --> 00:31:38,370
My birthday has past.

579
00:31:38,370 --> 00:31:40,080
I know. The last day of September.

580
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,760
Sorry to celebrate your birthday now.

581
00:31:41,760 --> 00:31:43,240
Do you want something as a gift?

582
00:32:01,910 --> 00:32:02,520
No.

583
00:32:03,270 --> 00:32:05,500
I got a big present that day.

584
00:32:07,570 --> 00:32:11,340
Really? Who gave you such a big gift?

585
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:13,150
Some man.

586
00:32:13,150 --> 00:32:14,100
A man!

587
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,860
Doesn't she look at the situation?

588
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:19,480
It's just a good trick.

589
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,570
We need to learn it.

590
00:32:22,430 --> 00:32:25,200
What did he give you? I'll give you a bigger one.

591
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:27,200
There is nothing better than that in the world.

592
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:28,520
Because it's perfect.

593
00:32:29,090 --> 00:32:31,160
Look how happy you are. Just receive the same gift for the rest of your life.

594
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:32,830
Thank you.

595
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:34,900
How dare you say thank you?

596
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,650
Lord Deity,

597
00:32:37,310 --> 00:32:38,090
Lord Deity.

598
00:32:39,410 --> 00:32:40,060
Coming.

599
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:43,050
Here we are. Let's eat. Let's eat meat.

600
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,800
Our Deity likes to eat the meat cooked to perfection.

601
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:47,910
Do you want to get beaten up again?

602
00:32:50,980 --> 00:32:52,650
Dr. Han! Dr. Han! Dr. Han!

603
00:32:54,300 --> 00:32:56,880
How did you spend your birthday before?

604
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:01,640
I usually had a nice meal with my family.

605
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:04,220
Family? Oh, that's good.

606
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:07,120
Eat cake with the family, blow out candles, and applaud the birthday.

607
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,760
I've been wanting to try it for a long time.

608
00:33:08,760 --> 00:33:10,610
Should we go buy a cake right now?

609
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:13,360
We can't do that. We're still one person short.

610
00:33:14,100 --> 00:33:15,260
Are there other people from your family?

611
00:33:16,680 --> 00:33:17,410
Your brother.

612
00:33:17,700 --> 00:33:18,320
What?

613
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,200
How can your birthday be without your family?

614
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,880
All men are bad.

615
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:27,230
As long as it's not Do Jin-woo.

616
00:33:27,230 --> 00:33:29,180
It can't be that guy, who is dangerous.

617
00:33:31,290 --> 00:33:31,880
No way!

618
00:33:34,530 --> 00:33:35,170
Why not?

619
00:33:36,350 --> 00:33:36,980
No way!

620
00:33:36,980 --> 00:33:39,690
Why? Why? Why? Why?

621
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,810
Why? Why? Why? Why?

622
00:33:42,160 --> 00:33:43,030
Why? Why not?

623
00:33:43,030 --> 00:33:45,020
My brother... my brother is very, very busy.

624
00:33:45,350 --> 00:33:46,620
He must not be available.

625
00:33:46,620 --> 00:33:47,910
No, there must be something wrong.

626
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,510
You hided me in front of your brother before too.

627
00:33:50,050 --> 00:33:52,150
Quiet, don't make a sound.

628
00:33:55,450 --> 00:33:57,480
Am I that much of a disgrace to you? Why?

629
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,530
I'm smart, handsome, and rich. I'm perfect for everyone.

630
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:04,170
Does your brother know Do Jin-woo?

631
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:06,360
What? Doesn't he like Do Jin-woo?

632
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:11,710
He doesn't like Do Jin-woo.

633
00:34:12,860 --> 00:34:15,360
He thought that Professor Do used me and ran away.

634
00:34:15,909 --> 00:34:17,770
And that's why my career is over.

635
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:21,110
That's true.

636
00:34:21,110 --> 00:34:22,070
It's not the same!

637
00:34:22,070 --> 00:34:24,230
Do Jin-woo and I are not the same person at all.

638
00:34:24,230 --> 00:34:26,050
Why should I have to suffer for his sins?

639
00:34:26,050 --> 00:34:28,429
I'm so wronged. Anyway, we should meet to clear up the misunderstanding.

640
00:34:28,429 --> 00:34:31,230
I’ll give him more money and meet his friends together to make him look good.

641
00:34:31,610 --> 00:34:34,300
You know, men like me for no reason.

642
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:38,650
Meeting him will only make things worse.

643
00:34:38,650 --> 00:34:39,420
I've decided.

644
00:34:40,409 --> 00:34:41,310
Article 3 of the contract.

645
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:47,280
Introduce family at any time.

646
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,989
Introduce

647
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:54,830
at any time.

648
00:34:59,020 --> 00:34:59,870
(Protection contract)

649
00:34:59,870 --> 00:35:00,730
(First, never say I love you)

650
00:35:00,730 --> 00:35:01,520
(Second, no meeting with other men in the absence of Deity)

651
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:02,520
(Third, introduce your family at any time)

652
00:35:02,520 --> 00:35:05,040
Oh no. Han Chul won't stop.

653
00:35:07,140 --> 00:35:08,770
If it goes on like this, will I be taken back to Yeongpo?

654
00:35:20,590 --> 00:35:21,290
It's here.

655
00:35:22,730 --> 00:35:25,680
I'll stay at this friend's house when I’m in Seoul.

656
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:28,610
It seems that your friend hasn't come back yet.

657
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,860
Yes, he's on a business trip.

658
00:35:31,820 --> 00:35:32,880
Are you okay to be alone?

659
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:35,130
What could be wrong with me?

660
00:35:36,510 --> 00:35:37,200
What?

661
00:35:37,870 --> 00:35:39,840
Are you worried that I will cause a fire by cooking instant noodles?

662
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,340
You eat late night snacks? You eat more than I think.

663
00:35:45,420 --> 00:35:46,690
Do you think that's what it means?

664
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:48,020
Is he an idiot?

665
00:35:48,720 --> 00:35:50,560
Take care, then.

666
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:52,340
I'm leaving.

667
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:04,180
Come back. Come back. One, two, three.

668
00:36:10,820 --> 00:36:15,160
Is he really gone? All right, forget it.

669
00:36:24,450 --> 00:36:25,300
I knew it.

670
00:36:26,500 --> 00:36:27,590
Then let’s go upstairs and have some tea...

671
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:34,780
Dad?

672
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,410
Dad.

673
00:36:40,280 --> 00:36:42,490
How did you find this place?

674
00:36:46,310 --> 00:36:48,400
I even found that remote village,

675
00:36:49,730 --> 00:36:51,120
let alone here.

676
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,650
It's good to be a doctor.

677
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,800
You look like a rich girl.

678
00:37:01,340 --> 00:37:04,180
Looks like you have a lot of ways to make money. That’s good.

679
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:06,120
I have no money.

680
00:37:06,860 --> 00:37:08,710
Because I applied for student loans.

681
00:37:08,710 --> 00:37:10,290
Selling your house or selling your car,

682
00:37:10,290 --> 00:37:13,410
even if you spend your whole life, you need to prepare the money.

683
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,250
You sent your father to jail with your own hands.

684
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:18,700
Don't you have that kind of consciousness, my daughter?

685
00:37:19,890 --> 00:37:20,880
Don't threaten me.

686
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:25,000
I'm not like my mom who was bullied by you.

687
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,370
What can you do?

688
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:46,560
Next time we meet, I hope you won't be empty-handed, my daughter.

689
00:38:20,290 --> 00:38:21,050
Sorry.

690
00:38:21,980 --> 00:38:23,450
What's your reason for not coming back?

691
00:38:24,120 --> 00:38:27,090
Captain, although you wanted me to tie a bell around the neck of the cat, Do Jin-woo.

692
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:37,630
I'm always concerned about other stray cats.

693
00:38:38,970 --> 00:38:41,830
I think I need to stay in Yeongpo to take care of her.

694
00:38:41,830 --> 00:38:42,730
Sorry.

695
00:38:50,660 --> 00:38:53,230
The next move is sunsalutation A.

696
00:38:55,880 --> 00:38:58,900
Look up to the thumb.

697
00:39:00,070 --> 00:39:01,380
Thumb, thumb, thumb.

698
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,620
Then push-ups.

699
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:10,230
Change to upper body up.

700
00:39:17,770 --> 00:39:21,410
Tell her it's family yoga.

701
00:39:22,770 --> 00:39:24,550
What? Living together is family.

702
00:39:24,550 --> 00:39:25,660
What's the big deal about family?

703
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,000
You can't even introduce me to your family, don’t talk about family.

704
00:39:35,350 --> 00:39:37,010
Twelve sheep.

705
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,620
Thirteen sheep.

706
00:39:40,600 --> 00:39:42,200
Fourteen sheep.

707
00:39:43,300 --> 00:39:44,160
Sheep.

708
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:47,760
Mutton is really delicious.

709
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:52,310
Lamb chops dipped in cumin are really delicious.

710
00:39:57,700 --> 00:39:58,740
Bear with it, please.

711
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:01,040
As a guest, how can I eat late night snack?

712
00:40:29,180 --> 00:40:32,780
But the boss of the plutocrat family also eats instant noodles for supper?

713
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:37,700
Haven't you heard that Chairman Choe, who sells semiconductors, also licks the cap of the yogurt bottle?

714
00:40:38,090 --> 00:40:39,920
What's the difference of the bosses of the plutocrat family?

715
00:40:39,920 --> 00:40:41,260
Everyone lives the same.

716
00:40:41,260 --> 00:40:45,520
We all eat late night snacks and have cakes on our birthdays.

717
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:55,740
I know our sweetheart is a bit of an embarrassment.

718
00:40:56,660 --> 00:40:57,480
Sweetheart?

719
00:40:57,850 --> 00:40:58,770
I mean Deity.

720
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,140
He doesn't do what he's told, so he is our sweetheart.

721
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:02,400
What's the big deal?

722
00:41:05,420 --> 00:41:09,790
Think of it as volunteering, letting him and your brother meet.

723
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,120
I'd like to do that.

724
00:41:15,100 --> 00:41:17,390
Your baby and my baby.

725
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:20,520
I want them to go to the baseball field and go camping together.

726
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:22,480
I want them to stay together like that.

727
00:41:26,070 --> 00:41:30,450
If one day Deity disappears like a mirage,

728
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,550
and I am left alone again,

729
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:39,620
I may cry because of that person, and that is something I need to bear.

730
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:46,840
But I don't want my brother to be disappointed and sad after he's gotten along well with him.

731
00:41:50,340 --> 00:41:51,840
Because our mother died early so long ago,

732
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:55,310
either he or I can't see the vacancy of our loved ones.

733
00:42:00,970 --> 00:42:03,670
When it solidifies, it becomes sticky and tasty.

734
00:42:05,410 --> 00:42:07,240
Even if you swallowed a stone now, it would be delicious, right?

735
00:42:07,820 --> 00:42:09,820
You didn't even eat dinner to be clever.

736
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:17,520
You two just simply eat a cake, blow out the candles,

737
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,410
and kiss to end it.

738
00:42:20,120 --> 00:42:20,800
Kiss?

739
00:42:21,540 --> 00:42:22,990
So that's the order I should follow?

740
00:42:24,340 --> 00:42:25,140
Are you that happy?

741
00:42:26,320 --> 00:42:28,390
Whether it's kissing or having a baby,

742
00:42:29,340 --> 00:42:30,840
just be happy.

743
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:36,940
If it's just the two of us,

744
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:40,720
who will Han Gye-jeol remember me with?

745
00:42:46,800 --> 00:42:48,060
Even if I disappear one day,

746
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:52,730
I hope Han Gye-jeol will remember me.

747
00:42:55,270 --> 00:42:56,550
On a nice day,

748
00:42:56,550 --> 00:43:00,650
I hope she can sit with her brother and talk about me.

749
00:43:03,940 --> 00:43:07,170
Just talk about happy things and miss me for the rest of her life.

750
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:15,620
As time passes, on the day when Han Gye-jeol dies,

751
00:43:18,070 --> 00:43:22,050
I hope the person she sees, and the person she wants to see is me.

752
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,590
I hope she can recognize me.

753
00:43:29,860 --> 00:43:32,880
You know how selfish you are now, right?

754
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,090
I've been waiting for 1,000 years.

755
00:43:40,760 --> 00:43:42,480
Dreaming of me, that level of selfishness is okay.

756
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:06,010
What are you doing with all the noise in the morning?

757
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:08,010
Don't you know from watching?

758
00:45:08,010 --> 00:45:09,060
I'm practicing yoga.

759
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:14,590
Because my wish is to practice yoga in such a big house.

760
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:18,250
I don't think you're doing very well as a wish.

761
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:22,450
I said wish. I never said I was good at it.

762
00:45:22,450 --> 00:45:25,300
Yes, you can dream about what you're not good at.

763
00:45:25,300 --> 00:45:28,230
Although the human tragedy comes from this.

764
00:45:46,090 --> 00:45:47,840
What?

765
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:49,920
So your wish is to practice yoga for couples?

766
00:45:49,920 --> 00:45:51,670
Experience being a person who is not good at dancing.

767
00:45:51,670 --> 00:45:54,620
Because I'm curious about what it's like to be a person like that.

768
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:56,160
You're...

769
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:00,890
Why are you dancing all of a sudden?

770
00:46:00,890 --> 00:46:02,540
You're...

771
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,410
You look good with your smile.

772
00:46:11,610 --> 00:46:13,870
What's wrong? You can keep laughing.

773
00:46:13,870 --> 00:46:16,860
My brother likes people who smile.

774
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:17,640
What?

775
00:46:20,790 --> 00:46:26,660
All right, let's go see my brother.

776
00:46:28,320 --> 00:46:30,140
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

777
00:46:30,140 --> 00:46:31,210
Because I'm tough?

778
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:32,800
Forget it. I'm just saying it.

779
00:46:32,800 --> 00:46:34,700
Because my brother is tough.

780
00:46:36,840 --> 00:46:39,150
My mom died a long time ago,

781
00:46:39,150 --> 00:46:41,920
so it's hard for me and him to face an empty seat.

782
00:46:44,050 --> 00:46:47,660
So even though you want to hide the empty space,

783
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:51,380
it will eventually come out.

784
00:46:51,380 --> 00:46:54,560
If your brother finally realizes that his sister was suffering alone,

785
00:46:54,560 --> 00:46:56,630
it will be the greatest harm to him.

786
00:46:59,090 --> 00:47:03,620
He really doesn't like it when I hid something from him.

787
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,300
He said that the only person he could trust in the world was me.

788
00:47:06,300 --> 00:47:07,920
But even if I lie to him,

789
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:10,370
then he will lose his love on earth and so on.

790
00:47:11,730 --> 00:47:13,620
If he finally finds out our relationship,

791
00:47:15,350 --> 00:47:17,930
he'll nag me more.

792
00:47:17,930 --> 00:47:21,090
I warn you my brother is hard to deal with.

793
00:47:22,910 --> 00:47:24,270
Leave the matter to me.

794
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:30,090
Why don’t we do partner yoga?

795
00:47:30,090 --> 00:47:31,200
I have to get ready.

796
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:32,670
What’s up? Let’s practice it now.

797
00:47:32,670 --> 00:47:33,840
No, because you can’t do it well.

798
00:47:35,170 --> 00:47:36,630
Why? Let’s practice together.

799
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,800
You’ve only been studying for 10 minutes.

800
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:02,310
Why do you look like someone who has been making coffee for ten years?

801
00:48:02,310 --> 00:48:06,510
I, Sim Hong-geun, can do anything once I make up my mind.

802
00:48:24,380 --> 00:48:26,820
The taste is exactly from the one that learns for 10 minutes.

803
00:48:29,230 --> 00:48:31,960
Isn’t there 20 minutes left?

804
00:48:31,960 --> 00:48:35,350
Keep working hard for 20 minutes, and I’ll become a 30-minute learner.

805
00:48:35,350 --> 00:48:38,050
At that time, the taste of coffee will be not bad.

806
00:48:38,050 --> 00:48:40,450
No, no.

807
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,090
Not bad is not enough.

808
00:48:42,090 --> 00:48:43,840
The taste must be great.

809
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:45,090
I’ve told you again and again that

810
00:48:45,090 --> 00:48:46,840
there will be a very distinguished guest.

811
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,480
You’re really good at talking.

812
00:48:49,480 --> 00:48:52,020
Then why not bring the best barista?

813
00:48:52,020 --> 00:48:54,340
Why did you ask the pork roast guy to do this?

814
00:48:55,660 --> 00:48:58,090
You’re really! You really never learn!

815
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:03,690
We’re here to witness how nice the minister is, aren’t we?

816
00:49:03,690 --> 00:49:08,800
And to witness how sweet and innocent our minister is.

817
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:11,600
How will the best barista know about this?

818
00:49:11,600 --> 00:49:16,340
Besides, he’s the one who opened the coffee shop for us,

819
00:49:16,340 --> 00:49:20,070
who lost money because of virtual currency and were almost homeless.

820
00:49:20,070 --> 00:49:22,410
Can that man imagine?

821
00:49:22,410 --> 00:49:24,610
Did I open this coffee shop for you?

822
00:49:24,610 --> 00:49:25,390
When?

823
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:28,840
Someday!

824
00:49:30,980 --> 00:49:32,900
Forget it. Forget it.

825
00:49:32,900 --> 00:49:36,770
Do you think I will betray my conscience and cheat people just for money?

826
00:49:36,770 --> 00:49:37,990
You can open it,

827
00:49:39,060 --> 00:49:40,900
as long as this day ends perfectly.

828
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:51,770
What did you say about your future brother-in-law’s taste?

829
00:49:51,770 --> 00:49:53,160
Americano?

830
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:54,520
Espresso?

831
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:55,480
Latte?

832
00:49:56,730 --> 00:49:58,980
Whatever it is, you have to try

833
00:49:58,980 --> 00:50:00,690
until he likes it.

834
00:50:05,250 --> 00:50:07,890
Hey, Chul.

835
00:50:07,890 --> 00:50:10,190
Did you come here after attending the motorcycle club?

836
00:50:10,190 --> 00:50:12,510
-The clothes... -A man can’t lose his morale.

837
00:50:12,510 --> 00:50:15,060
I must let my morale crush the other side’s arrogance.

838
00:50:15,060 --> 00:50:17,110
You’re not here to interrogate a criminal, okay?

839
00:50:17,110 --> 00:50:18,500
Nothing different, okay?

840
00:50:18,500 --> 00:50:19,950
Do you trust the person in front of you?

841
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:21,880
Continue or stop?

842
00:50:21,880 --> 00:50:23,270
We must figure it all out. So nothing different.

843
00:50:24,710 --> 00:50:27,500
There’s no need, because he’s someone to trust.

844
00:50:28,660 --> 00:50:31,050
You must tell me what kind of man he is, and then ask me to trust, okay?

845
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:36,380
Would you come here if I told you?

846
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:44,340
What? Do I look very weird?

847
00:50:44,340 --> 00:50:46,380
Very old? Like that?

848
00:50:47,450 --> 00:50:50,350
Do you still care at this time?

849
00:50:50,350 --> 00:50:52,830
Isn’t this the first time you introduce your boyfriend to me?

850
00:50:52,830 --> 00:50:55,880
I also want to make a good impression on him.

851
00:50:55,880 --> 00:50:57,440
Maybe we’ll become family.

852
00:51:15,710 --> 00:51:16,660
Do Jin-woo?

853
00:51:18,800 --> 00:51:21,450
Is this the guy you’re dating?

854
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:22,520
Are you crazy?

855
00:51:22,520 --> 00:51:26,270
Ye... Yeah...

856
00:51:26,270 --> 00:51:28,610
It’s the first time we met. I’m Do Jin-woo.

857
00:51:28,610 --> 00:51:29,520
First time?

858
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:30,250
Meet me?

859
00:51:32,950 --> 00:51:34,980
Look at this guy. I’m really speechless.

860
00:51:34,980 --> 00:51:38,010
Hey, Han Chul, do you have to be this rude?

861
00:51:38,010 --> 00:51:41,260
Have we met somewhere?

862
00:51:41,260 --> 00:51:42,600
Yes.

863
00:51:42,600 --> 00:51:44,300
When we met at the Yeongpo Police Station,

864
00:51:44,300 --> 00:51:46,160
you really pissed me off.

865
00:51:46,160 --> 00:51:47,620
Yeongpo Police Station?

866
00:51:50,030 --> 00:51:51,310
Look at your acting.

867
00:51:53,770 --> 00:51:56,450
I’m almost fooled by you. You’re really great.

868
00:51:56,450 --> 00:51:59,020
Are you afraid that my stupid sister will know how many secrets you have?

869
00:51:59,020 --> 00:52:00,070
So you acted like that?

870
00:52:00,070 --> 00:52:01,250
Hey, Han Chul!

871
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:02,480
I’ve told you not to go too far.

872
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:04,120
Are you taking sides with this guy?

873
00:52:06,220 --> 00:52:09,160
I’m not taking his side. I’m giving him a chance.

874
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,490
I know you don’t like Professor Do,

875
00:52:12,490 --> 00:52:15,880
but at least give him a chance to explain, right?

876
00:52:15,880 --> 00:52:17,730
It’s not too late to make a decision after listening.

877
00:52:17,730 --> 00:52:18,750
Explain?

878
00:52:18,750 --> 00:52:23,840
Do you know how many people slip away with a glib tongue after getting into trouble?

879
00:52:23,840 --> 00:52:26,430
I’m really sick of explanations.

880
00:52:26,430 --> 00:52:28,050
There’s no need to hear his explanation. Get out.

881
00:52:31,110 --> 00:52:33,300
Did he meet Do Jin-woo?

882
00:52:33,300 --> 00:52:37,580
Did you meet me around the end of September?

883
00:52:38,690 --> 00:52:40,090
Do you suddenly remember?

884
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:43,630
Do you change your strategy because you know it wouldn’t work?

885
00:52:43,630 --> 00:52:45,520
Because I had a fall...

886
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:49,200
My memory gets a little swamped.

887
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:50,850
I didn’t mean to pretend not to know.

888
00:52:50,850 --> 00:52:53,530
I can’t remember what happened during that time.

889
00:52:53,530 --> 00:52:58,010
Although I don’t know what I said and what I did,

890
00:52:59,370 --> 00:53:02,900
please forgive me if I’ve been rude.

891
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:09,040
-Did you kill Choe Gwang-mo? -I don’t know.

892
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:11,990
I had a fall about 40 days ago.

893
00:53:11,990 --> 00:53:14,490
And then I lost my memory.

894
00:53:14,490 --> 00:53:17,110
Do you think it’s a hearing room here?

895
00:53:17,110 --> 00:53:21,000
Never been there. Didn’t kill. Don’t know. Do you think it will be over if you say so?

896
00:53:23,460 --> 00:53:24,590
Really?

897
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,500
Didn’t you know about Professor Do’s accident?

898
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:33,050
Because of the shock, he had a temporary memory problem.

899
00:53:34,980 --> 00:53:38,910
He didn’t run away after getting into trouble. He really can’t remember.

900
00:53:43,440 --> 00:53:46,120
Not everything can be forgiven for the reason you can’t remember.

901
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:47,770
Let’s go.

902
00:53:47,770 --> 00:53:49,160
Ah.

903
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:50,080
Go!

904
00:53:52,190 --> 00:53:55,720
Leave with him. Looks like you have a lot to talk about with your brother.

905
00:53:57,740 --> 00:53:58,740
Let’s go.

906
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:07,000
This rude guy! He can’t stand a punch from me.

907
00:54:11,860 --> 00:54:15,450
I thought I should persuade him, so I came back with him for the time being.

908
00:54:15,450 --> 00:54:17,200
You must be sad.

909
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:18,500
I’m really sorry.

910
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:21,840
Alright. I’ve thought of this.

911
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:23,640
Of course, I’ve lived for a thousand years,

912
00:54:23,640 --> 00:54:27,540
and this is the first time I’m hated by someone. I feel a little strange.

913
00:54:27,540 --> 00:54:30,090
Are you still boasting at this time?

914
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:33,050
But it’s good to be consistent.

915
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,130
What are you doing in the room?

916
00:54:37,130 --> 00:54:40,340
-I’ve told you not to contact that guy. -You’re really...

917
00:54:40,340 --> 00:54:41,330
Open the door.

918
00:54:43,490 --> 00:54:45,190
Open the door... Don’t you?

919
00:54:46,330 --> 00:54:48,550
I’m really sorry for

920
00:54:48,550 --> 00:54:51,160
always letting you see this.

921
00:54:51,160 --> 00:54:52,940
Go pacify your brother.

922
00:54:52,940 --> 00:54:56,620
Although I don’t know what Do Jin-woo has done, I feel a little uneasy.

923
00:54:56,620 --> 00:54:58,990
But it shouldn’t be a big deal.

924
00:54:58,990 --> 00:55:02,000
He is not a man who has the courage to make a big mistake.

925
00:55:03,690 --> 00:55:04,840
Yes.

926
00:55:04,840 --> 00:55:07,410
He’s different from someone.

927
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:10,690
Open the door... Don’t you open it?

928
00:55:10,690 --> 00:55:12,290
I’ll tear down the door.

929
00:55:12,290 --> 00:55:14,480
I’ll call you tomorrow.

930
00:55:24,110 --> 00:55:29,270
Oh, my heart is so painful.

931
00:55:29,270 --> 00:55:30,430
Hey, Han Gye-jeol.

932
00:55:33,120 --> 00:55:35,090
I’ve told you not to contact that guy.

933
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:36,880
Chul, listen.

934
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:40,560
I didn’t introduce him to you to get your permission.

935
00:55:40,560 --> 00:55:44,480
Because you’re my only family and I don’t want to keep it a secret.

936
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:46,980
I think it’s a courtesy to the family.

937
00:55:46,980 --> 00:55:49,190
But looking at you now, I guess I shouldn’t have done that.

938
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,340
How could you do that in front of people?

939
00:55:52,510 --> 00:55:56,100
Sister, you... Aren’t afraid of that guy?

940
00:55:56,100 --> 00:55:58,020
Afraid of him? Why?

941
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,100
The first time I saw that guy in CCTV,

942
00:56:00,100 --> 00:56:02,600
he was choking you.

943
00:56:02,600 --> 00:56:04,880
That was the first time. I forgive him.

944
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:06,010
But have you seen this?

945
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:13,140
It’s said he’s mentally ill, and

946
00:56:13,140 --> 00:56:14,930
has anger controlling disorder or something.

947
00:56:14,930 --> 00:56:16,980
Aren’t you afraid of so much gossip?

948
00:56:16,980 --> 00:56:20,250
You don’t even know what he’ll do when he turns around.

949
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,450
Maybe he’ll say something like losing his memory again.

950
00:56:23,450 --> 00:56:24,700
This is prejudice.

951
00:56:24,700 --> 00:56:25,820
This is experience.

952
00:56:25,820 --> 00:56:27,410
He is only temporarily ill.

953
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:29,040
He’s a patient I need to treat,

954
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:30,680
not the killer you’re after.

955
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:34,870
What if he’s the murder? Completely... A crazy man?

956
00:56:36,670 --> 00:56:37,970
Is there any evidence?

957
00:56:37,970 --> 00:56:39,050
I trust my instincts.

958
00:56:39,050 --> 00:56:41,080
I trust him.

959
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:44,520
So if you want to catch an innocent man, show me the evidence.

960
00:56:52,660 --> 00:56:53,220
(Shim Chan-ho Captain of the Wide Area Search Team Dr. Tae Meet tomorrow in Yeongpo, right? What time shall we meet?)

961
00:56:53,220 --> 00:56:54,870
We’ll meet in Yeongpo, right?
(Shim Chan-ho Captain of the Wide Area Search Team Dr. Tae Meet tomorrow in Yeongpo, right? What time shall we meet?)

962
00:56:54,870 --> 00:56:55,910
We’ll meet in Yeongpo, right?

963
00:56:55,910 --> 00:56:57,310
What time shall we meet?

964
00:56:59,800 --> 00:57:00,970
(I'm in Seoul for something.)

965
00:57:00,970 --> 00:57:01,810
I have something to handle in Seoul. So I can’t go.
(I'm in Seoul for something.)

966
00:57:01,810 --> 00:57:02,730
I have something to handle in Seoul. So I can’t go.

967
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:18,120
(I'll be there by 6:00.)

968
00:57:18,120 --> 00:57:19,520
I’ll be there by 6.
(I'll be there by 6:00.)

969
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:20,250
(I'll be there by 6:00.)

970
00:57:24,120 --> 00:57:26,320
(I'll be there by 6:00.)

971
00:57:29,700 --> 00:57:33,230
(Seoul Myeongin University Hospital)

972
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:35,660
I told you not to come here.

973
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:39,850
-It’s the Speaker’s order. -Really?

974
00:57:39,850 --> 00:57:42,310
He asked me to come and ask about it myself.

975
00:57:42,310 --> 00:57:44,510
Isn’t there any news from the police?

976
00:57:46,630 --> 00:57:49,950
Speaker Kim Pil-soo... He is really disappointed in you.

977
00:57:49,950 --> 00:57:55,870
No... I heard other people at the scene said he froze to death or something.

978
00:57:55,870 --> 00:57:59,660
How’s it? Isn’t it enough?

979
00:57:59,660 --> 00:58:01,690
-Frozen to death? -Yeah, frozen to death.

980
00:58:03,980 --> 00:58:05,710
I want to see for myself.

981
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:15,990
Chief I Sang-jae, it’s forbidden to visit here.

982
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:18,200
Well, I have never seen you.

983
00:58:18,200 --> 00:58:21,860
Who are you? Why is it forbidden?

984
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,860
I’m Officer Han Chul from the Wide-area Search Team.

985
00:58:23,860 --> 00:58:27,860
Yesterday in the ward, you disclosed the patient’s status to the outside, right?

986
00:58:27,860 --> 00:58:29,390
That... How do you...

987
00:58:29,390 --> 00:58:32,700
For fear that the patient will come to his sense, everything is recorded in the ward.

988
00:58:32,700 --> 00:58:34,480
It should have been told to you from the beginning.

989
00:58:37,910 --> 00:58:39,050
Who are you?

990
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:41,380
(Choi Tae-hyung)

991
00:58:41,380 --> 00:58:42,520
Nice to meet you.
(Choi Tae-hyung)

992
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:47,950
The patient wears an oxygen respirator mask all the time.

993
00:58:47,950 --> 00:58:50,730
I heard there is a problem with his trachea.

994
00:58:50,730 --> 00:58:55,160
Yeah, our Professor Choe is the best in this field.

995
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:56,620
Both of you, please go back.

996
00:59:10,870 --> 00:59:13,380
You always refused to do it before.

997
00:59:13,380 --> 00:59:15,040
But when you really do it, you’re quite decisive.

998
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:18,230
I am very serious when I do things.

999
00:59:18,230 --> 00:59:20,790
Anyway, why did you change your mind?

1000
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:25,200
I heard you told the captain that you had a stray cat.

1001
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:26,340
Are you also that...

1002
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:28,550
It’s very popular these days. What’s it called?

1003
00:59:28,550 --> 00:59:30,230
Well... Cat dad.

1004
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:34,230
I have no kid, how can I be a dad?

1005
00:59:37,810 --> 00:59:40,270
Well, to be serious,

1006
00:59:40,270 --> 00:59:43,520
where can I find a doctor who’s able to keep a secret?

1007
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,150
Because the trauma caused by the beating is rather severe,

1008
00:59:52,150 --> 00:59:54,120
he’s not awake now.

1009
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:56,120
The doctor in charge also said before,

1010
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:58,780
there is no other way but to continue to observe.

1011
00:59:58,780 --> 01:00:02,150
So just take care of the patient until he wakes up.

1012
01:00:02,150 --> 01:00:03,210
What are you doing?

1013
01:00:06,740 --> 01:00:08,390
I might have told you that

1014
01:00:08,390 --> 01:00:10,230
there’s recording equipment here.

1015
01:00:10,230 --> 01:00:13,120
So please use honorifics that are appropriate for serious situations.

1016
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:14,840
I don’t want.

1017
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:15,600
What?

1018
01:00:16,570 --> 01:00:19,070
I have patients to take care of.

1019
01:00:19,070 --> 01:00:21,070
I have no spare energy to take care of another patient.

1020
01:00:21,270 --> 01:00:24,790
And why do I take care of the patient in the general hospital?

1021
01:00:24,790 --> 01:00:26,570
There are many doctors here, and they are all excellent.

1022
01:00:26,570 --> 01:00:27,340
Much better than me.

1023
01:00:27,340 --> 01:00:29,680
Even if they’re excellent, it doesn’t work. They don’t keep secrets.

1024
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,410
We don’t need that kind of people.

1025
01:00:32,120 --> 01:00:32,840
What’s up?

1026
01:00:34,150 --> 01:00:36,050
Does he really matter as a witness?

1027
01:00:39,690 --> 01:00:40,690
Are you...

1028
01:00:41,550 --> 01:00:44,280
Are you in charge of that dangerous case we brought up last time?

1029
01:00:45,280 --> 01:00:46,920
Didn’t I say I didn’t want you to take over?

1030
01:00:46,920 --> 01:00:48,270
But why don’t you listen?

1031
01:00:48,270 --> 01:00:50,270
If you’re like this, why not go back to Yeongpo with me?

1032
01:00:50,270 --> 01:00:51,590
Quit your job as a police officer.

1033
01:00:51,590 --> 01:00:53,870
If he wakes up, I can catch the killer.

1034
01:00:55,370 --> 01:00:56,950
Only he wakes up

1035
01:00:57,330 --> 01:00:59,020
can I be safe as soon as possible.

1036
01:01:05,610 --> 01:01:07,460
Really annoying.

1037
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:14,460
(Hospitalization Record Name: Ma Sang-Chen)

1038
01:01:14,690 --> 01:01:17,430
He has a compound fracture, a ruptured spleen,

1039
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:19,340
and subdural hemorrhage.

1040
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:21,430
When will he wake up?

1041
01:01:21,910 --> 01:01:24,230
It’s hard to predict as for this kind of patient.

1042
01:01:24,230 --> 01:01:26,230
Maybe he’ll wake up tomorrow,

1043
01:01:27,250 --> 01:01:29,000
or never wake up.

1044
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:36,150
Be sure to keep it a secret for me.

1045
01:01:36,620 --> 01:01:38,980
You can’t even tell this to someone you know.

1046
01:01:49,700 --> 01:01:50,870
Lord Deity!

1047
01:01:51,160 --> 01:01:52,300
Lord Deity!

1048
01:01:52,700 --> 01:01:54,660
Lord Deity, Lord Deity!

1049
01:01:56,870 --> 01:01:57,730
Lord Deity.

1050
01:01:58,150 --> 01:01:59,340
What are you doing?

1051
01:01:59,970 --> 01:02:01,170
You’re asking knowingly.

1052
01:02:01,170 --> 01:02:02,520
Am I not meditating?

1053
01:02:02,940 --> 01:02:05,640
It’s said when peace is found in the heart, the body becomes soft.

1054
01:02:05,640 --> 01:02:07,040
I thought it was nonsense.

1055
01:02:07,040 --> 01:02:08,460
But it’s useful.

1056
01:02:08,460 --> 01:02:11,060
Humans did invent something good.

1057
01:02:11,060 --> 01:02:11,960
Really?

1058
01:02:12,480 --> 01:02:15,710
That means Han Gye-jeol won’t come back today, right?

1059
01:02:16,120 --> 01:02:18,860
So it’s like a North Korean woman piercing her thigh with a bamboo needle

1060
01:02:18,860 --> 01:02:22,110
in a long winter solstice night

1061
01:02:22,110 --> 01:02:24,860
to seek inner peace.

1062
01:02:24,860 --> 01:02:26,570
Ok Shin, you bastard!

1063
01:02:26,950 --> 01:02:29,500
Good. You invite this yourself.

1064
01:02:29,500 --> 01:02:32,520
My hands are really itchy recently.

1065
01:02:32,520 --> 01:02:35,120
I’m scolded by a brat.

1066
01:02:35,120 --> 01:02:37,590
All I want to do is to kill him with my fist.

1067
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:39,200
Who should I torture? Who should I kill?

1068
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:41,620
There’s no need to consider that. It’s you, the bastard Ok Shin.

1069
01:02:41,620 --> 01:02:43,380
-I’m gonna hit you in the head. -Kill me. Come on.

1070
01:02:43,380 --> 01:02:45,590
Kill me. Kill me. If you want to kill me, do it.

1071
01:02:45,590 --> 01:02:47,240
Lord Deity, go ahead and kill people causally.

1072
01:02:47,240 --> 01:02:48,650
Whether to freeze them or dry them to death.

1073
01:02:48,650 --> 01:02:50,590
You can kill people the way you want.

1074
01:02:51,770 --> 01:02:52,780
What’s wrong with you?

1075
01:02:52,780 --> 01:02:54,800
You... What’s going on?

1076
01:02:54,800 --> 01:02:56,410
Are you finally crazy?

1077
01:02:56,410 --> 01:02:58,970
Kill me and let Kim Pil-soo escape.

1078
01:02:58,970 --> 01:02:59,550
That’s all right.

1079
01:02:59,550 --> 01:03:01,540
Why do you mention Kim Pil-soo here?

1080
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:02,810
The list.

1081
01:03:04,720 --> 01:03:06,670
You finally found out what this is.

1082
01:03:06,670 --> 01:03:08,450
Great! Ok Shin!

1083
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,820
It’s really disgusting. Disgusting. Really.

1084
01:03:12,710 --> 01:03:14,610
But I haven’t said what it is.

1085
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:16,140
As you told me,

1086
01:03:16,790 --> 01:03:19,180
I checked out everyone on the list.

1087
01:03:19,860 --> 01:03:22,070
I didn’t expect... They’re all dead.

1088
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:25,320
What was the cause?

1089
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:27,020
-It’s all the same? -No.

1090
01:03:27,270 --> 01:03:28,480
The causes of death are all different.

1091
01:03:28,480 --> 01:03:30,340
Jang Mi-sun, you know.

1092
01:03:30,340 --> 01:03:31,620
She died of a medical accident.

1093
01:03:32,090 --> 01:03:33,340
Come on. Let’s start from the top.

1094
01:03:33,590 --> 01:03:36,730
The man had peritonitis when he was operated on for appendicitis, and then died.

1095
01:03:36,730 --> 01:03:38,650
The man drowned when he went to play in the water.

1096
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:39,990
The man jumped from his office while working the night shift.
(Patient No. Choi Jeong-hee (46) F Kim Yun-han (48) M Jang Mi-sun (58) F U Hyang-hee (55) F Bak Shin-ae (59) F I Sung-sun (62) F Hwang Sung-sik (66) M Nam Se-ri (27) M)

1097
01:03:39,990 --> 01:03:41,920
The man jumped from his office while working the night shift.

1098
01:03:42,410 --> 01:03:44,520
Do Jin-woo also fell from his home, right?

1099
01:03:45,020 --> 01:03:46,830
And this guy died because of a brake failure.

1100
01:03:46,830 --> 01:03:48,230
The other person died of carbon monoxide poisoning

1101
01:03:48,230 --> 01:03:49,980
while sleeping at home.

1102
01:03:49,980 --> 01:03:52,830
Bak Chung-seong was also faked to commit suicide in a similar way.

1103
01:03:52,830 --> 01:03:53,420
Yes.

1104
01:03:54,230 --> 01:03:56,700
Anyway, the causes of death are all different, but

1105
01:03:58,160 --> 01:03:59,340
as for this man, Nam Se-ri,

1106
01:03:59,340 --> 01:03:59,480
(Nam Se-ri (27) M)
as for this man, Nam Se-ri,

1107
01:03:59,480 --> 01:03:59,800
(Nam Se-ri (27) M)

1108
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,690
he’s the only one I can’t find out anything about.
(Nam Se-ri (27) M)

1109
01:04:01,690 --> 01:04:03,520
His name and ID number don’t match.

1110
01:04:03,520 --> 01:04:06,120
I’ve told people to keep tracing.

1111
01:04:06,420 --> 01:04:09,770
It’s obvious that Kim Pil-soo has already handled it.

1112
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:10,870
Just like Bak Chung-seong.

1113
01:04:11,300 --> 01:04:12,590
In addition to those physical examinations,

1114
01:04:12,590 --> 01:04:14,590
are there no other similarities between them?

1115
01:04:14,870 --> 01:04:17,250
For example, they all encountered a medical accident in Pilseong Hospital?

1116
01:04:17,620 --> 01:04:21,160
Or they all held grudge against Kim Pil-soo?

1117
01:04:21,410 --> 01:04:23,340
I talked to their families, too.

1118
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:25,070
Nothing else has been found so far.

1119
01:04:27,930 --> 01:04:29,620
First, gather up the families.

1120
01:04:29,620 --> 01:04:32,520
Get together and make public the falsification of medical records.

1121
01:04:32,800 --> 01:04:34,920
Let them sue for damages.

1122
01:04:35,480 --> 01:04:37,700
We should be able to find out something from here.

1123
01:04:37,700 --> 01:04:40,240
I also told the secretaries to make such suggestions to them in private.

1124
01:04:40,240 --> 01:04:41,020
But

1125
01:04:41,800 --> 01:04:43,050
they all said they didn’t want to.

1126
01:04:43,560 --> 01:04:44,700
They’re busy making a living,

1127
01:04:44,700 --> 01:04:45,510
and have no time for that.

1128
01:04:45,700 --> 01:04:48,300
It’s impossible to win a case against a big company.

1129
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,560
That’s true.

1130
01:04:56,340 --> 01:04:58,800
If the world is full of justice,

1131
01:04:59,020 --> 01:05:00,980
then I don’t have to come here.

1132
01:05:08,220 --> 01:05:09,060
Ok Shin,

1133
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:13,040
isn’t there still a family who can raise questions?

1134
01:05:14,350 --> 01:05:15,640
Who? Who?

1135
01:05:16,460 --> 01:05:17,360
That’s me.

1136
01:05:18,340 --> 01:05:21,020
Jang Mi-sun’s son. Do Jin-woo.

(Indictment Suspect Kim Pil-soo Violation of the Medical Treatment Law and Claim for Damages)

1139
01:05:29,390 --> 01:05:32,010
You said this list was taken over from Bak Chung-seong in person.

1140
01:05:32,010 --> 01:05:33,060
Is that a fact?

1141
01:05:33,380 --> 01:05:34,160
Yes.

1142
01:05:34,380 --> 01:05:36,410
When I was the Chief of Planning Office in Pilseong Hospital,

1143
01:05:36,410 --> 01:05:38,480
Bak Chung-seong came to me in person.

1144
01:05:39,020 --> 01:05:41,150
He said he’s been falsifying medical records for years.

1145
01:05:41,150 --> 01:05:43,420
He couldn’t go on because of his conscience.

1146
01:05:43,420 --> 01:05:44,970
Do you have any proof?

1147
01:05:45,270 --> 01:05:48,160
The text messages between us are still saved.

1148
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:49,590
These have also been forwarded to the prosecutors.

1149
01:05:50,420 --> 01:05:53,160
Then why didn’t you reveal it earlier and come out now?

1150
01:05:53,160 --> 01:05:56,420
Do you want to hit Pilseong to win the business competition?

1151
01:05:56,420 --> 01:05:57,450
Is that why you did it?

1152
01:06:05,260 --> 01:06:07,420
There is a secret of Bulhwa Company.

1153
01:06:08,850 --> 01:06:11,430
I believe anyone with ears must have heard it once,

1154
01:06:11,430 --> 01:06:13,930
and anyone who has a mouth must have talked about it once.

1155
01:06:13,930 --> 01:06:15,740
That’s the health of the heir.

1156
01:06:15,740 --> 01:06:17,930
I told you myself about my health problems.

1157
01:06:17,930 --> 01:06:21,120
I know too well how much it’ll hurt Bulhwa Company.

1158
01:06:21,770 --> 01:06:22,570
But

1159
01:06:22,570 --> 01:06:25,250
in order to let justice flow in the society,

1160
01:06:25,790 --> 01:06:26,770
my brother and I

1161
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:30,070
have decided to give up worldly interests.

1162
01:06:30,950 --> 01:06:33,740
I had an accident a few months ago.

1163
01:06:34,470 --> 01:06:35,780
And I lost my memory.

1164
01:06:36,160 --> 01:06:38,690
Yeah, just as the rumors said

1165
01:06:38,690 --> 01:06:40,770
I have amnesia and anger controlling disorder.

1166
01:06:41,380 --> 01:06:43,550
So I totally forgot that

1167
01:06:43,550 --> 01:06:45,230
Bak Chung-seong had given me the list.

1168
01:06:46,800 --> 01:06:49,510
When I heard about Bak Chung-seong’s death, I finally remembered.

1169
01:06:50,010 --> 01:06:51,330
That’s why I’m here now.

1170
01:06:51,330 --> 01:06:54,330
What is your relationship with Jang Mi-sun in that list?

1171
01:06:55,380 --> 01:06:56,300
She is...

1172
01:06:56,970 --> 01:06:58,230
She is my biological mother.

1173
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:03,830
Why did Pilseong hide my mom’s medical records?

1174
01:07:04,910 --> 01:07:06,830
Is that why my mom died?

1175
01:07:08,460 --> 01:07:09,900
I must find out.

1176
01:07:10,820 --> 01:07:12,880
Did you have anything to do with Bak Chung-seong’s death?

1181

What’s the list of Pilseong Hospital?

1182
01:07:22,730 --> 01:07:24,340
Of course I don’t know.

1183
01:07:24,620 --> 01:07:27,950
Maybe he wants to fight for all the justice in the world.

1184
01:07:28,860 --> 01:07:31,230
Anyway, he said himself

1185
01:07:31,410 --> 01:07:32,480
that he’s not normal.

1186
01:07:33,150 --> 01:07:36,060
I was just wondering how to get him into the police station.

1187
01:07:36,870 --> 01:07:39,510
Well, he’s just about to find himself.

1188
01:07:44,780 --> 01:07:46,280
I can’t believe.

1192
01:08:22,800 --> 01:08:24,729
Oh, I’m sorry.

1193

You’re a high-level figure. The police station is full of different people.

Apart from here, there is no place for a quiet conversation.

If you really feel uncomfortable,

1196
01:08:34,470 --> 01:08:36,830
then I’ll ask someone to arrange the innermost room.

1197
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,160
But it will take a long time.

1198
01:08:40,779 --> 01:08:43,270
Forget it. Let’s start.

1199
01:09:12,689 --> 01:09:15,430
I hear doctors can’t leave the hospital without a responsible doctor.

1200
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:20,069
I can do that at this level.

1201
01:09:21,569 --> 01:09:22,920
Earlier, you said this was a dangerous case.

1202
01:09:22,920 --> 01:09:25,180
You’re not asking me to meet the killer, are you?

1203
01:09:25,800 --> 01:09:26,819
Am I a fool?

1204
01:09:27,340 --> 01:09:29,180
If that’s the case, can I ask you to come over?

1205
01:09:30,160 --> 01:09:30,979
That’s true.

1206
01:09:32,689 --> 01:09:33,689
Don’t worry.

1207

He can’t see your face.

It’s definitely possible.

But very angry.

There’s not much time left.

1220

Please be nice to her.

1221
01:11:33,730 --> 01:11:36,830
We have 27 days left together.

1222
01:11:36,830 --> 01:11:38,060
Is that true?

1223
01:11:38,410 --> 01:11:40,230
