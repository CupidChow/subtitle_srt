1
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:15,380
O Hyeon!

2
00:00:16,780 --> 00:00:20,270
There is one thing that has been left in my heart

3
00:00:21,910 --> 00:00:23,730
that I didn't say it.

4
00:00:29,810 --> 00:00:31,840
I love you, Seol Hui.

5
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:39,070
Loving you

6
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:42,510
is my entire life.

7
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:21,050
A place of punishment

8
00:01:22,710 --> 00:01:27,620
where only the wind blows for a short time and no rain beats.

9
00:01:32,330 --> 00:01:35,920
In this underworld, where you will come one day,

10
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,560
waiting for you is my daily life.

11
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:06,250
What are you waiting for to stay here?

12
00:02:07,830 --> 00:02:08,630
Seol Hui,

13
00:02:09,650 --> 00:02:11,760
I want to see Seol Hui.

14
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:17,020
You two met because of fire, and your fate is full of suffering.

15
00:02:18,329 --> 00:02:22,280
Hurry to cross the road to hades and wash the marriage of fire with cold water.

16
00:02:23,110 --> 00:02:24,420
In your next life,

17
00:02:24,880 --> 00:02:30,060
a fate as clear as flowing water will be waiting for you.

18
00:02:31,400 --> 00:02:33,640
No, I don't want it.

19
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:37,750
Seol Hui is my destiny.

20
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:41,750
Although you are proud that you can change your fate,

21
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:47,210
everything in this world is not changed by the will of man.

22
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:49,700
Let go of everything.

23
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:53,560
Let your will follow your destiny.

24
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:59,320
I have to meet Seol Hui no matter what.

25
00:03:03,450 --> 00:03:04,200
One.

26
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:05,720
(Episode 2)
One.

27
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:06,460
(Episode 2)

28
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:08,160
Two.

29
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,650
Two.

30
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:15,310
Three.

31
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,420
Three.

32
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,590
I'm unexpectedly strong.

33
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,079
You don't have to worry.

34
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:33,460
Do you really want to learn?

35
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:34,790
Yes.

36
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,850
Seol Hui, why do you want to learn martial arts?

37
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,570
After my parents died,

38
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,990
I lived with distant relatives as an adopted daughter.

39
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,690
Although I was grateful for their kindness,

40
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,480
I knew exactly why they brought me here.

41
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,510
They want to give me away to a powerful man as a concubine and profit from it.

42
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:30,450
I didn't want to let go and wait to be sold away.

43
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:35,060
I need to learn martial arts to protect my body.

44
00:04:35,810 --> 00:04:37,790
With your current strength, it's impossible.

45
00:04:48,650 --> 00:04:49,330
Take this.

46
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:53,510
Stab me here.

47
00:04:53,860 --> 00:04:54,650
What?

48
00:04:55,080 --> 00:04:56,430
Don't you want to protect yourself?

49
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,060
You must kill me with a single stab.

50
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,260
Don't hesitate.

51
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:15,310
If you can't even do that, what else do you want?

52
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:16,420
Just give up.

53
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:17,670
You’re too much.

54
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,190
Why don't you just hire someone?

55
00:05:19,190 --> 00:05:20,960
I don't have the money.

56
00:05:21,260 --> 00:05:22,810
Just use the guy you've already hired.

57
00:05:23,850 --> 00:05:24,500
What?

58
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:25,890
Hire me.

59
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:33,320
I'll protect you, Seol Hui.

60
00:05:36,280 --> 00:05:37,200
O Hyeon.

61
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,540
Give me your hand.

62
00:06:02,390 --> 00:06:03,960
What kind of flower is this?

63
00:06:04,510 --> 00:06:07,700
It's a heather flower that blooms in both the world and the underworld.

64
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,080
I will protect you in both the world and the underworld,

65
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,300
and that's my determination.

66
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:01,330
It's been a long time since I've seen the sun.

67
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:06,870
Under the blade of the snowstorm, my heart has cooled down.

68
00:07:07,690 --> 00:07:11,040
Memories became as transparent and empty as ice.

69
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:13,380
I've forgotten everything.

70
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,650
But I still stand in the waiting without seeing an end.

71
00:07:33,310 --> 00:07:34,409
A soul,

72
00:07:34,909 --> 00:07:37,690
so left with a grudge.

73
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:00,180
It's time to rest.

74
00:08:01,690 --> 00:08:02,660
I don't want to.

75
00:08:03,450 --> 00:08:04,830
I want to see her.

76
00:08:06,990 --> 00:08:08,370
Who are you waiting for

77
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:11,260
in such a long time?

78
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:13,250
She is...

79
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,780
Her name is...

80
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:29,150
Her face...

81
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:32,929
Are you waiting for someone you can't remember?

82
00:08:33,710 --> 00:08:34,750
For what?

83
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:40,820
Is it anger? Revenge?

84
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,250
Apology?

85
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:44,330
Or is it love?

86
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:46,770
That is...

87
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:50,960
That is...

88
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,650
You'll understand when you see her.

89
00:08:58,070 --> 00:09:00,100
I've given you a chance already in all that time.

90
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,570
A chance to obey my words

91
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:06,130
and submit to your fate.

92
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,140
But you have finally committed the sin of disobeying me,

93
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:12,540
you arrogant and foolish human.

94
00:09:13,300 --> 00:09:16,120
As punishment, from now on you will become a Deity.

95
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:19,800
You will become the presence of death that everyone fears,

96
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:22,850
everyone wants to avoid, and no one will love you.

97
00:09:42,930 --> 00:09:44,110
As a Deity,

98
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:48,140
your ears will always echo with the curses and resentment of the dead and humans.

99
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:56,020
So you will lead the dead in the underworld and kill again and again in the world.

100
00:10:07,650 --> 00:10:09,310
Until the woman says she loves you even being like this,

101
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:14,780
your cursed life will end and you will be at peace forever.

102
00:10:49,090 --> 00:10:51,480
What a night for killing.

103
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:58,430
(Seoul Police who are doing their best, the public is satisfied with the security)

104
00:11:06,200 --> 00:11:07,220
You really can't find it?

105
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:10,930
I also checked the emergency hotline. I can’t find him at any hospital in Seoul.

106
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:15,700
Let's look at this first.

107
00:11:22,450 --> 00:11:23,820
Does he want to die?

108
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,320
He must have gotten shocked from the fall.

109
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,250
It's okay.

110
00:11:33,860 --> 00:11:35,740
See? He walked there on his own,

111
00:11:36,120 --> 00:11:38,420
not being dragged away like you think.

112
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,600
What about the building's CCTV?

113
00:11:40,270 --> 00:11:42,960
Didn't any strange people enter the professor's home?

114
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:44,480
I've confirmed everything.

115
00:11:45,210 --> 00:11:46,730
I've been watching the timeline all day.

116
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:49,950
Only Do Jin-woo went in alone.

117
00:11:52,180 --> 00:11:53,670
Then why did he fall down?

118
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,040
Yes, bro. Did you track the location?

119
00:12:02,620 --> 00:12:03,470
Did he find him?

120
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:05,290
Thanks, bro. I'll treat you to a big meal in a couple of days.

121
00:12:06,910 --> 00:12:08,390
Where is he? He didn't say where the professor is.

122
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:10,880
He said he lost his signal when he got on the Yeongpo Expressway.

123
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,460
Does he have a place to go in Yeongpo City?

124
00:12:13,030 --> 00:12:13,850
How do I know?

125
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:17,600
This guy is not running away, right?

126
00:12:17,980 --> 00:12:19,760
Why would he run away? It's nonsense.

127
00:12:20,120 --> 00:12:22,640
He got angry and got into trouble, but he couldn't take the consequences

128
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,710
because the other party was the Pilseong Consortium.

129
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:25,500
That's why he disappeared unnoticed.

130
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,930
There are a lot of irresponsible guys like this.

131
00:12:28,070 --> 00:12:29,050
It's impossible.

132
00:12:30,870 --> 00:12:33,580
If the professor disappeared like that.
I'd be the only one who'd be weird.

133
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,990
only I would be a crazy and a traitor to the professor.

134
00:12:37,970 --> 00:12:41,660
Chul, can you look up the credit card details or something?

135
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:44,330
Not everyone can do that,

136
00:12:45,870 --> 00:12:48,040
but you know who I am, believe me.

137
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:56,820
Where are you going? Are you going to Yeongpo?

138
00:12:57,510 --> 00:12:58,180
Go home.

139
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,480
Go home?

140
00:12:59,860 --> 00:13:00,870
I want to sleep.

141
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:03,980
How can you sleep in this situation?

142
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:06,120
Tomorrow will be worse than today, right?

143
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:10,440
At least get some sleep to keep going.

144
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,480
Has he disappeared?

145
00:14:02,510 --> 00:14:05,700

00:16:10,090 --> 00:16:11,910
Kill him! Kill him!

167
00:16:12,910 --> 00:16:15,120
Kill Jo Bong-pil! Kill him!

168
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:20,380
Who's Jo Bong-pil?

169
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,180
Jo Bong-pil! Jo Bong-pil! Jo Bong-pil! Jo Bong-pil!

170
00:16:27,110 --> 00:16:28,270
He's a pharmacist.

171
00:16:28,830 --> 00:16:32,180
He gave his juniors the dope,

172
00:16:32,180 --> 00:16:34,670
but was released for lack of evidence,

173
00:16:34,670 --> 00:16:36,780
because he used a clever method to make it.

174
00:16:36,780 --> 00:16:38,670
Who wants to know what he did?

175
00:16:38,670 --> 00:16:41,300
Give me the photo. I can't kill him until I see his face.

176
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,550
(Korea Today Jo Bong-pil, the pharmacist of the dope "dictator", was finally acquitted today)

177
00:16:55,950 --> 00:16:57,280
Can you really do anything?

178
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,660
Then have a drink with me.

179
00:17:02,050 --> 00:17:03,440
You can't even do that for your daughter?

180
00:17:06,270 --> 00:17:07,140
Aren't you her mother?

181
00:17:45,390 --> 00:17:46,090
Come here!

182
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,210
Women are funny when they play hard to get.

183
00:18:03,680 --> 00:18:05,160
The camera. The camera is...

184
00:18:06,290 --> 00:18:07,150
Are you looking for this?

185
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:10,370
Who are you?

186
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,370
Who the hell are you?

187
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:20,700
I'm the King of the road to hades,

188
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,810
here to take care of the dirt that's piled up in the corner.

189
00:18:22,810 --> 00:18:23,660
What?

190
00:18:23,660 --> 00:18:25,940
What a stench!

191
00:18:25,940 --> 00:18:27,420
When I see you guys,

192
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,480
I think the Creator created humans by looking at garbage.

193
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:34,330
That guy is a freak too!

194
00:18:34,330 --> 00:18:36,450
What are you talking about, you crazy bastard?

195
00:18:43,970 --> 00:18:48,300
That's right, human beings are funny when they play hard.

196
00:18:51,210 --> 00:18:53,760
Let me go. Let me go.

197
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,530
I'm not a god who lets people go.

198
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,080
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

199
00:19:31,080 --> 00:19:32,720
Why are you burning these precious clothes?

200
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:33,350
They're very expensive.

201
00:19:33,350 --> 00:19:34,690
These are Do Jin-woo's.

202
00:19:34,690 --> 00:19:36,090
What? You want to wear them?

203
00:19:36,090 --> 00:19:38,730
Who knows if the dead man's clothes are tainted with bad luck?

204
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,710
Burn them quickly. Burn them quickly.

205
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,000
Okay, go to Elysium.

206
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,770
Go to Elysium.

207
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,040
Go to Elysium.

208
00:19:53,950 --> 00:19:55,400
Lord Deity!

209
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,050
You're back.

210
00:19:59,110 --> 00:20:03,690
It's been a long day. Would you like a glass of honey water?

211
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:06,990
Lord Deity!

212
00:20:12,130 --> 00:20:15,650
How do you keep getting rejected for 500 years?

213
00:20:15,650 --> 00:20:18,770
If you go to the World Cup, even a soccer ball will get kicked less than you.
("Refusal" and "Kick" are homophones)

214
00:20:18,770 --> 00:20:20,020
Hurry up and burn it.

215
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:22,100
Who are you talking about getting kicked?

216
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,030
You want to be kicked

217
00:20:24,030 --> 00:20:27,820
and swell up like a ball to learn your lesson, right?

218
00:20:27,820 --> 00:20:30,570
You didn't dare to hit the Lord Deity, so you only hit me.

219
00:20:30,570 --> 00:20:33,540
Why should I hit the poor Lord Deity?

220
00:20:33,540 --> 00:20:37,840
How can you keep feeling sorry for him for 500 years?

221
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:40,340
In the underworld, he has to listen to the grievances of the dead,

222
00:20:40,340 --> 00:20:42,180
and in the world, he has to hear the curses of humans,

223
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:43,330
even he doesn't want to do it,

224
00:20:43,330 --> 00:20:44,270
he still has to kill people every day.

225
00:20:44,270 --> 00:20:45,150
Isn't that pathetic?

226
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:46,660
As long as he kills the person who receives the most curses,

227
00:20:46,660 --> 00:20:48,280
his life will become very quiet,

228
00:20:48,280 --> 00:20:49,380
and isn’t that enough?

229
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,510
What's the use of just one day of silence?

230
00:20:51,510 --> 00:20:53,940
For the remaining 99 days, new pain awaits every day.

231
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,770
Honestly, if he comes to be punished and doesn't even do this.

232
00:20:55,770 --> 00:20:57,450
Is that still a punishment? That is a vacation, right?

233
00:20:57,450 --> 00:21:00,330
Even if it is a punishment, there must be an end.

234
00:21:00,330 --> 00:21:03,060
Even if you count the sand on the beach, you can count it all.

235
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:07,810
But our Lord Deity's curse doesn't even have an expiration date.

236
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,490
How can there be no expiration date?

237
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:11,640
As long as we find the woman, that's all we need.

238
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,730
That's easy to say. Who knows when that woman will appear?

239
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,950
The Creator must have a plan.

240
00:21:20,630 --> 00:21:24,600
If you really can't bear it, go find the ring.

241
00:21:25,390 --> 00:21:29,710
Where the hell is that ring?

242
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:33,040
Let's send Do Jin-woo first.

243
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:37,360
Go to Elysium.

244
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:41,400
Go to Elysium.

245
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,850
You said the body disappeared? Does it make sense?

246
00:21:53,850 --> 00:21:57,660
Jung-sik, you didn't make a mistake, did you?

247
00:21:57,660 --> 00:21:59,510
He fell from the roof.

248
00:21:59,510 --> 00:22:01,580
This is not a height where a human can survive a fall.

249
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:03,200
Didn't you say he fell on the car?

250
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,540
It's possible that it was a fluke that he didn't die.

251
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,730
Just in case,

252
00:22:05,730 --> 00:22:09,010
I searched all the hospitals in Seoul,

253
00:22:09,010 --> 00:22:11,010
but there was no trace of him.

254
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,840
He disappeared, right?

255
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:22,600
Post the indictment from the prosecutor's office to the hospital's intranet,

256
00:22:22,600 --> 00:22:24,470
and say that he was so disappointed after being reported by Han Gye-jeol, who was elected by himself,

257
00:22:24,470 --> 00:22:26,460
that he committed suicide.

258
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,910
Make a big mess and send Han Gye-jeol away.

259
00:22:28,910 --> 00:22:32,340
But what if Do Jin-woo comes back alive,

260
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:34,170
what are you going to do then?

261
00:22:34,170 --> 00:22:37,920
They'll say it's not a suicide.

262
00:22:40,590 --> 00:22:45,570
The extreme stress and mental illness caused by the trauma of the fall…

263
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:50,140
If we don't succeed in killing him, we can just turn him into a mental patient.

264
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:56,010
Even if Do Jin-woo comes back alive, he won't be able to do anything.

265
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:24,190
Koreans must eat! Survive to eat!
(Koreans must eat! Survive to eat!)

266

269

Hello.

270
00:23:49,890 --> 00:23:52,010
Hello.

271
00:23:58,780 --> 00:24:02,770
Sir, do you have pain when pressing on your back?

272
00:24:02,770 --> 00:24:04,160
No.

273
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:06,740
Please remove your hand. I'll look at the injury.

274
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:10,390
What are you doing? I can't treat it until I see it.

275
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:12,500
You still think you're the doctor here?

276
00:24:12,500 --> 00:24:15,210
Who you think are you shouting at?

277
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:16,010
What did you say?

278
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:18,820
Doctor, please take a look here.

279
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:23,850
Get out of the way!

280
00:24:28,030 --> 00:24:32,710
How dare you come here? You traitor!

283
00:24:54,290 --> 00:24:55,950
Hello.

284
00:25:04,570 --> 00:25:06,920
It's okay.

285
00:25:07,870 --> 00:25:11,280
I didn't lie and I didn't betray.

286
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,360
Professor Do already knew I was going to testify.

287
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:17,150
I didn't report it on my own initiative, but the professor asked me to do that.

288
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,680
Is he mad?

289
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,070
Why did he ask you to do that?

290
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:23,270
Because…

291
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:28,120
I can't tell you because it's a private matter.

292
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,550
You have nothing to say, right?

293
00:25:31,550 --> 00:25:33,270
Is that a reason to be sophomoric?

294
00:25:33,270 --> 00:25:34,860
How clueless are you?

295
00:25:34,860 --> 00:25:37,850
That's why I said it depends on the school and family.

296
00:25:37,850 --> 00:25:40,710
Because those people have basic literacy.

297
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:45,910
Why do we need to have more conversation here?

298
00:25:45,910 --> 00:25:47,400
Go and bring Do Jin-woo,

299
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,910
so we will know who is right.

(To be continued)

301
00:26:44,370 --> 00:26:46,430
Disappeared?

302
00:26:46,430 --> 00:26:49,410
It’s not fog or smoke. How could a person disappear suddenly?

303
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:08,960
No, why did you try to commit suicide?

304
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:14,500
Brother, you wouldn’t do that.

305
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:21,890
Since you’re so tired, why not talk to me?

306
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,320
Brother, what do I mean to you?

307
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:27,000
How can you do this to me?

308
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,680
Professor Do, please talk to me.

309
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:34,960
Professor Do!

310
00:27:36,440 --> 00:27:39,120
Professor Do, please, open the door.

311
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,150
I’ll understand whatever you say.

312
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,670
I won’t beat you.

313
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:58,430
He did something wrong out of anger. Because it’s Pilseong Consortium,

314
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,220
and he couldn’t take the consequences,

315
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,740
he ran away quietly.

316
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:04,050
There are so many irresponsible people like him.

317
00:28:04,050 --> 00:28:07,580
Did he really run away or not?

I wouldn’t have loved you so easily.

325
00:28:31,510 --> 00:28:32,480
((Yeonri University Surgery) Forced to quit group chat)
I wouldn’t have loved you so easily.

326
00:28:32,480 --> 00:28:33,920
((Yeonri University Surgery) Forced to quit group chat)

327
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:38,510
Ah, you can’t do this to me.
((Yeonri University Surgery) Forced to quit group chat)

328
00:28:40,950 --> 00:28:45,050
Go find him, whatever it takes!

329
00:28:45,050 --> 00:28:47,410
When I find Do Jin-woo, I’ll kill him.

330
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:52,470
Tae Jeong-won!

331
00:28:52,470 --> 00:28:54,690
Hey, so good to see you.

332
00:28:54,690 --> 00:28:56,540
You can contact Professor Do, right?

333
00:28:56,540 --> 00:28:59,510
No, how many times do I have to tell you?

334
00:28:59,510 --> 00:29:01,320
You know from the very beginning, right?

335
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:04,250
You have an unusual relationship with Professor Do. There's no way you don't know how.

336
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:06,510
Although I don’t know what happened to him,

337
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,590
my situation is not good either.

338
00:29:09,590 --> 00:29:11,730
I’ll definitely be fired by Pilseong Hospital.

339
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,510
I can go nowhere now.

340
00:29:14,510 --> 00:29:18,930
Jeong-won, I’ve known you for years,

341
00:29:18,930 --> 00:29:21,140
so please tell me where Professor Do is.

342
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:24,900
I don’t know. I really have no idea.

343
00:29:24,900 --> 00:29:27,070
Even if I know, I won’t tell you.

344
00:29:27,070 --> 00:29:27,620
What?

345
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:30,330
I don’t want you to have anything to do with my brother.

346
00:29:30,330 --> 00:29:31,110
But why?

347
00:29:31,110 --> 00:29:32,230
Because you’re a troublemaker.

348
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:32,920
Troublemaker?

349
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,600
People around you will all get into trouble.

350
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:38,950
That's what the club called you all the time.

351
00:29:38,950 --> 00:29:40,990
Didn’t you know that?

352
00:29:43,850 --> 00:29:46,490
Why did you speak ill of me whenever you got together?

353
00:29:46,490 --> 00:29:48,200
Could the club thrive without me?

354
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,010
Things are the same this time.

355
00:29:50,010 --> 00:29:52,410
Whatever you saw, as long as you could keep silent,

356
00:29:52,410 --> 00:29:54,100
brother would let everything go and go to America.

357
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:56,500
Everyone would be happy.

358
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,340
But why did you pretend to be great

359
00:29:58,340 --> 00:30:00,080
and step up?

360
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:03,820
So, you mean it’s all my fault?

361
00:30:04,420 --> 00:30:08,170
Ah, I’m also a victim.

362
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:12,530
If Professor Do hadn’t appeared, I would live a good life now.

363
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:16,210
Even if I couldn’t work in Pilseong Hospital, I would go to a small hospital.

364
00:30:16,210 --> 00:30:20,950
I can heal people, be respected and live a happy life.

365
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:25,870
You’re the one who ruined your fate.

366
00:30:25,870 --> 00:30:28,680
And now this is what you get.

367
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:31,010
I don’t know if you can understand.

368
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:32,420
You really

369
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,240
Let go! Don’t you?

370
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:37,460
I won’t let go unless you tell me where Professor Do is.

371
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:38,800
Do you want to fight with me?

372
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:41,690
Remember? I won the first prize

373
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:43,880
in the arm-wrestling competition in our school.

374
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,800
Seriously? You might have misjudged me from my look.

375
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:50,010
I’m strong enough.

376
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:52,250
Don’t you remember I was once invited by the Plastic Surgery Department?

377
00:30:52,250 --> 00:30:53,820
It really hurts.

378
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:56,250
Stop, stop, stop, stop!

379
00:30:56,250 --> 00:30:58,160
Sister, sis, sister!

380
00:30:58,160 --> 00:30:59,360
Sister, are you okay?

381
00:30:59,360 --> 00:31:02,480
Who are you? Let go! Let go of my sister!

382
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:03,520
What?

383
00:31:05,230 --> 00:31:07,160
Oh my god! Han Chul!

384
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:09,280
Are you okay?

385
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:10,550
Direct hit! Damn it!

386
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:12,420
Your nose is bleeding.

387
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:14,490
What?

388
00:31:14,490 --> 00:31:16,360
Out of my way.

389
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,330
Step aside. That woman, she’s really...

390
00:31:19,330 --> 00:31:21,460
Crap!

391
00:31:21,460 --> 00:31:23,310
What? Such a lack of respect.

392
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:26,100
You, you will be sorry! Stay away from me!

393
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:28,160
I won’t let you go next time I meet you.

394
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:42,270
Have some fried chicken. Calm down.

395
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:46,460
Eat meat whenever you feel down. Remember?

396
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:48,770
That expensive?

397
00:31:48,770 --> 00:31:53,620
Ah? Even more if it’s in a good location.

398
00:31:54,580 --> 00:31:56,980
I see.

399
00:32:01,630 --> 00:32:03,210
What’s expensive?

400
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:06,800
I asked about leaflets and banners but they're so expensive.

401
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:10,020
Getting approval from the district government is also tricky.

402
00:32:10,020 --> 00:32:12,770
Chul, did you find anything?

403
00:32:12,770 --> 00:32:18,750
That... No.

404
00:32:18,750 --> 00:32:21,920
A detective from the Major Case squad can't even do that.

405
00:32:24,750 --> 00:32:26,690
Tax evader.

406
00:32:27,170 --> 00:32:31,070
An idiot who only knows about leaflets can’t blame me.

407
00:32:31,070 --> 00:32:32,390
What?

408
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:36,510
In today’s world, nobody finds someone in this way.

409
00:32:36,510 --> 00:32:38,340
Then in what way?

410
00:32:38,340 --> 00:32:41,010
You... What do you know?

411
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:45,560
("Influenza" and "Influencer" are homophones)

417

powerful and influential people. Understand?

418
00:32:58,270 --> 00:33:01,200
Where am I supposed to meet those people?

419
00:33:12,190 --> 00:33:15,040
Looking for Do Jin-woo, who cheated his father-in-law of billion won and ran away after an affair.

Do you know our country has the largest number of fraud cases in the world?

429
00:33:36,530 --> 00:33:38,250
Murderers will definitely be put in prison.

DBS?

Is that a term?

435
00:33:50,090 --> 00:33:53,710
D is for money, B is for cheating, and S is for the era.

Whether it's a punishment or a curse,
the five-day workweek must be observed.

After all I’m a deity now.

455
00:35:03,960 --> 00:35:06,760
It’s quite impolite to do this.

456
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:09,560
You’re everywhere and omnipotent.

What happened to Do Jin-woo?

466
00:35:37,370 --> 00:35:40,160
Kill him.

A long life messed you up.

Can he be treated on the way?

470

I’ll be responsible and won’t make you regret.

00:37:19,950 --> 00:37:20,810
What should we do?

482
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:21,090
(Searching for Do Jin-woo having an affair who cheated his family out of 1 billion won)
What should we do?

483
00:37:21,090 --> 00:37:22,510
Lord Deity, you can’t kill yourself.
(Searching for Do Jin-woo having an affair who cheated his family out of 1 billion won)

484
00:37:22,510 --> 00:37:23,030
Lord Deity, you can’t kill yourself.

485
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:27,860
Find the poster first.

486
00:37:27,860 --> 00:37:29,700
That guy?

487
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:32,560
Kill him. And the rumor will disappear.

488
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:35,100
Yes, Lord Deity. You’re a genius.

489
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,770
I’ll kill you!

490
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:41,660
I’ll make your organs twist together and freeze all your blood.

491
00:37:41,660 --> 00:37:42,840
It’s this woman.

492
00:37:42,840 --> 00:37:43,840
Han Gye-jeol.

493
00:37:46,370 --> 00:37:47,740
I’ve seen her before.

494
00:37:51,940 --> 00:37:53,890
What’s wrong, Professor Do?

495
00:37:55,770 --> 00:37:57,650
I was going to kill her at that time.

496
00:37:57,650 --> 00:37:59,560
It’s all Okshin fault.

497
00:37:59,560 --> 00:38:00,820
Don’t say that.

498
00:38:00,820 --> 00:38:03,590
You can’t kill her. Never.

499
00:38:05,470 --> 00:38:07,110
Do you really think I’m that nice?

500
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,510
You even give me some suggestions.

501
00:38:08,510 --> 00:38:12,160
She’s innocent. I’m afraid you’ll break the rule if you kill her.

502
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:15,880
Getting me in trouble. That's enough.

503
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,080
Photo.

504
00:38:17,080 --> 00:38:18,040
Here you are.

505
00:38:22,270 --> 00:38:24,690
You can’t! Deity!

506
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:26,440
What about me?

507
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:26,960
What?

508
00:38:41,900 --> 00:38:43,780
(Yeongpo Park)

509
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:55,870
Seems like a lot of people saw him in this park.

510
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:09,240
Mom, help!

511
00:39:16,450 --> 00:39:18,700
Daydream, daydream.

512
00:39:18,700 --> 00:39:22,450
After I met Do Jin-woo, what have I been through?

513
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,730
If Do Jin-woo appears now, it must be a daydream again.

514
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:27,790
Han Gye-jeol!

515
00:39:29,230 --> 00:39:31,310
I’m hearing voices. What can I do?

516
00:39:31,310 --> 00:39:32,150
Han Gye-jeol!

517
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:40,540
Professor Do

518
00:39:50,470 --> 00:39:51,600
Professor Do

519
00:40:11,070 --> 00:40:12,090
It hurts!

520
00:40:18,850 --> 00:40:20,040
Still alive?

521
00:40:21,530 --> 00:40:23,360
Strong enough.

522
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:31,490
I'm pretty strong. Don't worry about me.

523
00:40:31,490 --> 00:40:33,030
What?

524
00:40:33,030 --> 00:40:34,050
Who is she?

525
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:47,950
Are you alright?

526
00:40:47,950 --> 00:40:49,760
Did you get hurt?

527
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,640
What are you doing?

528
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:57,840
You look good.

529
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:02,390
I can’t believe you didn't call me since you’re fine!

530
00:41:26,240 --> 00:41:27,800
You’ll die if you get closer to me.

531
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,860
You’re gonna die sooner or later but your death will look very tragic.

532
00:41:29,860 --> 00:41:32,020
I’ve already died because of you.

533
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:34,480
You don’t even know I’ve been dreaming about this moment.

534
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,120
I won’t let you go that easily.

535
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:40,110
Do you work part time on a chicken farm?

536
00:41:40,110 --> 00:41:42,280
Why do you always wring my head?

537
00:41:44,070 --> 00:41:46,300
I admit that I did do something bad.

538
00:41:46,300 --> 00:41:48,070
Let go of me.

539
00:41:51,330 --> 00:41:52,350
Damn it!

540
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:54,720
What? What happened?

541
00:41:59,210 --> 00:42:01,140
I said that let go of me.

542
00:42:06,190 --> 00:42:08,450
Am I being soft?

543
00:42:08,450 --> 00:42:10,580
I never had such a feeling.

544
00:42:10,580 --> 00:42:12,330
Who are you?

545
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:15,100
Don’t you know? I’m Han Gye-jeol.

546
00:42:15,100 --> 00:42:17,130
Yeah, Han Gye-jeol, who the hell are you?

547
00:42:17,130 --> 00:42:19,880
Even the heroes and beauties who were washed away

548
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:21,650
couldn’t attract me.

549
00:42:21,650 --> 00:42:23,090
How can I be soft for an ordinary person like you?

550
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,520
What?

551
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,580
Are you comparing me to food?

552
00:42:27,580 --> 00:42:28,560
Are you silly?

553
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,300
Ordinary people. Peter and Paul. Lily and Lucy.

554
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:32,020
Don’t you know that?

555
00:42:32,020 --> 00:42:33,470
What are you talking about?

556
00:42:33,470 --> 00:42:36,020
You might live in somewhere like Cheong Hak Dong.

557
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:38,000
So even the police can’t find you.

558
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:40,650
Why listen to this crap when I can’t even finish hearing all the curses?

559
00:42:40,650 --> 00:42:45,020
You’re a sinner who owes me a huge debt. How dare you to complain.

560
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:46,190
Sinner?

561
00:42:46,190 --> 00:42:49,060
I’m here to punish, not to commit a sin.

562
00:42:49,060 --> 00:42:51,990
Why are you talking nonsense like a pastor of the church?

563
00:42:51,990 --> 00:42:54,340
Enough! Just tell me.

564
00:42:54,340 --> 00:42:55,650
Did you really run away?

565
00:42:55,650 --> 00:42:57,270
Why did you run away? Why?

566
00:42:57,270 --> 00:42:58,160
Why do you need to know?

567
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:00,080
I need to know what happened to you to decide whether to forgive you or not.

568
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,190
Forgive?

569
00:43:01,190 --> 00:43:02,650
I have no reason to offer.

570
00:43:02,650 --> 00:43:05,020
If you’re a human, you should at least apologize.

571
00:43:05,020 --> 00:43:06,150
How can you be so arrogant?

572
00:43:06,150 --> 00:43:07,580
Is it gonna change anything if I apologize?

573
00:43:07,580 --> 00:43:09,350
Why people like to insist on these meaningless apologies?

574
00:43:09,350 --> 00:43:10,410
Stupid!

575
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,330
Professor Do, you’re not even a human.

576
00:43:15,330 --> 00:43:20,630
You’re good at judging. Yes, I’m not a human.

577
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:21,970
I think I understand.

578
00:43:21,970 --> 00:43:24,310
I know why you’ve become like this.

579
00:43:24,310 --> 00:43:26,600
Yeah? Why?

580
00:43:28,550 --> 00:43:29,390
What?

581
00:43:31,160 --> 00:43:32,150
Amnesia? Why do you think so?

582
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:34,300
(Sending)
Amnesia? Why do you think so?

583
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:34,890
Amnesia? Why do you think so?

584
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:37,610
Can you remember anything I've said so far?

585
00:43:37,610 --> 00:43:38,530
Of course not.

586
00:43:38,530 --> 00:43:41,210
That’s it. You’re suffering from amnesia.

587
00:43:41,210 --> 00:43:44,940
Your brain might probably be greatly hit when you fell.

588
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:45,430
If it’s traumatic brain injury,

589
00:43:45,430 --> 00:43:46,210
(traumatic brain injury)
If it’s traumatic brain injury,

590
00:43:46,210 --> 00:43:47,830
even if we know the reason, it’s hard to get your memory back.
(traumatic brain injury)

591
00:43:47,830 --> 00:43:48,840
even if we know the reason, it’s hard to get your memory back.

592
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,950
What should I do?

593
00:43:52,760 --> 00:43:56,340
If you're under extreme pressure, it can also be dissociative amnesia.

594
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:59,990
That illness is the result of psychological factors. It’s possible to get recovered dramatically.

595
00:44:02,970 --> 00:44:04,020
What are you doing?

596
00:44:04,020 --> 00:44:06,460
Diagnosing. Diagnose you first, then I can treat you.

597
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:08,280
Who are you? How dare you diagnose me?

598
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,700
So it’s the first time we meet, right?

599
00:44:12,700 --> 00:44:15,350
I’ve never seen any human like you before, in all kinds of sense.

600
00:44:16,860 --> 00:44:20,060
So let’s get to know each other.

601
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:23,270
I’m Han Gye-jeol, a doctor.

602
00:44:23,270 --> 00:44:25,440
Because of my name

603
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,850
I hate the song ‘Forgotten Season’.

604
00:44:26,850 --> 00:44:28,830
I don’t know if it’s because my fate is bad or if it's because I’m nobody,

605
00:44:28,830 --> 00:44:30,830
I’ve been forgotten again this time.

606
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:32,270
Why do you mention your fate?

607
00:44:32,270 --> 00:44:34,510
Do you want me to change your lifeless fate?

608
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,810
I’ve never seen a cheeky person like you. I think it’s the first time I meet you.

609
00:44:35,910 --> 00:44:38,450
Introduce yourself. Introduce, okay?

610
00:44:38,450 --> 00:44:40,290
At least you should know your name.

611
00:44:40,290 --> 00:44:41,650
Deity.

612
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:42,640
Am I crazy?

613
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,430
Why did I tell a human my name?

614
00:44:46,440 --> 00:44:48,870
If you’re Deity, then are you the unusual ghost?

615
00:44:50,210 --> 00:44:52,520
Which bastard said that I’m a ghost? On the road to hades...

616
00:44:52,520 --> 00:44:57,190
Okay, okay. No one dares to disobey you. You’re the king.

617
00:44:57,190 --> 00:44:58,510
Definitely!

618
00:44:59,580 --> 00:45:02,700
I can’t believe he thinks he’s someone else. Does he have dissociative fugue?

619
00:45:02,700 --> 00:45:03,680
(Dissociative fugue, lack of self-awareness or mental disorders that form new self-identity)
I can’t believe he thinks he’s someone else. Does he have dissociative fugue?

620
00:45:03,680 --> 00:45:05,400
(Dissociative fugue, lack of self-awareness or mental disorders that form new self-identity)

621
00:45:05,400 --> 00:45:05,900
Just leave him alone now.
(Dissociative fugue, lack of self-awareness or mental disorders that form new self-identity)

622
00:45:05,900 --> 00:45:08,400
Just leave him alone now.

623
00:45:13,970 --> 00:45:16,340
Nice to meet you, Deity.

624
00:45:19,090 --> 00:45:20,610
What do you want to do?

625
00:45:20,610 --> 00:45:22,440
Do you want to throw me on the floor like before?

626
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:26,420
I did that because I didn’t know your situation.

627
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:27,580
Professor Do...

628
00:45:27,580 --> 00:45:31,060
No, Deity, I thought you betrayed me.

629
00:45:31,060 --> 00:45:32,450
Then whose fault is it?

630
00:45:33,620 --> 00:45:36,310
If it’s anyone’s fault,

631
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:37,590
Then it’s God’s fault.

632
00:45:37,590 --> 00:45:40,640
Dose God have so many time to care about that kind of thing?

633
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:44,020
It’s better to blame God than blame people, right?

634
00:45:44,020 --> 00:45:48,240
It hurts less to think you’re sick than to be betrayed.

635
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,630
The whole betrayal, revenge and love thing isn’t really my style.

636
00:45:51,630 --> 00:45:52,620
Then what’s your style?

637
00:45:52,620 --> 00:45:53,590
Happy ending.

638
00:45:53,590 --> 00:45:55,820
People meet to break up, born to die.

639
00:45:55,820 --> 00:45:57,860
All the endings set by God are tragic.

640
00:45:57,860 --> 00:46:00,050
Happy ending is never his choice.

641
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,940
Because he doesn’t want people to be happy.

642
00:46:01,940 --> 00:46:04,490
Even if the endings set by God are tragic,

643
00:46:04,490 --> 00:46:06,660
We as human, have to be happy at the beginning.

644
00:46:07,710 --> 00:46:10,470
So let’s shake hands,

645
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,760
happily.

646
00:46:33,610 --> 00:46:34,730
Why do I...

647
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:40,150
Maybe you’re...

648
00:46:45,880 --> 00:46:47,130
(Tae Jeong-won)

649
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:49,050
Tae Jeong-won

650
00:46:53,390 --> 00:46:56,410
Deity!

651
00:46:58,000 --> 00:46:59,100
Professor Do!

652
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:01,450
Professor Do!

653
00:47:03,070 --> 00:47:04,240
Damn it!

654
00:47:04,240 --> 00:47:08,430
Do Jin-woo, if I catch you, you’ll be dead!

655
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,160
Where are you?

656
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,690
I have to find you.

657
00:47:24,370 --> 00:47:26,790
It can’t rain in the underworld.

658
00:47:27,860 --> 00:47:31,420
So I feel like I’m in the sun when I’m in the rain.

659
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:45,690
I was worried that I was dreaming, fantasizing or going crazy.

660
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:49,450
But it’s the time.

661
00:47:49,450 --> 00:47:51,490
It’s the time for her to appear.

662
00:47:54,030 --> 00:47:58,260
I’m finally going to be liberated.

663
00:48:06,610 --> 00:48:07,650
Oh...

664
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:11,040
What makes you so happy?

665
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:15,710
The person who can lift my curse has finally appeared.

666
00:48:20,450 --> 00:48:22,640
Let’s go.

667
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:25,260
Your Deity,

668
00:48:25,260 --> 00:48:28,540
do you mean that the person who can lift the curse appeared?

669
00:48:33,310 --> 00:48:35,250
If there’s one thing I miss in the underworld,

670
00:48:35,250 --> 00:48:37,260
it’s the rain.

671
00:48:37,260 --> 00:48:41,360
When I am physically and mentally exhausted, I truly long for this drop of rain.

672
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:45,820
Even if I have to leave, I’ll enjoy the rain and wine today.

673
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,320
-But Your Deity.
-What?

674
00:48:51,320 --> 00:48:54,210
Didn’t you forget her face and name?

675
00:48:54,210 --> 00:48:56,740
Then how are you sure that Han Gye-jeol is her?

676
00:48:56,740 --> 00:49:00,430
My heart has softened.

677
00:49:00,430 --> 00:49:04,290
Although I don’t know if it’s grudge, revenge, apology or adoration,

678
00:49:04,290 --> 00:49:07,870
in short... my heart flipped.

679
00:49:07,870 --> 00:49:11,280
You have no heart. It was burned on the road to hades.

680
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,000
Having heart flipped without heart,

681
00:49:13,000 --> 00:49:14,710
it’s the first time I’ve heard it since I’ve had hair.

682
00:49:14,710 --> 00:49:16,390
Do you want me to pull out all your hair?

683
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:18,560
Jade God has a point.

684
00:49:18,560 --> 00:49:21,150
It’s hard to be sure with that alone.

685
00:49:21,150 --> 00:49:25,880
Horn God, we have the ring, right?

686
00:49:37,940 --> 00:49:42,220
Go to... the Yang world now.

687
00:49:42,220 --> 00:49:44,240
So soon?

688
00:49:44,240 --> 00:49:47,870
For the sin of using greed and rumors to cause discord in the world,

689
00:49:47,870 --> 00:49:50,500
we’re in cultivation now.

690
00:49:50,500 --> 00:49:53,440
You said it takes 3,000 years to cleanse sins,

691
00:49:53,440 --> 00:49:54,830
how come so soon...

692
00:49:54,830 --> 00:50:00,390
Every 99 years, Deity will go to the Yang world for 99 days.

693
00:50:00,390 --> 00:50:03,690
Go to help him and cleanse your sins.

694
00:50:03,690 --> 00:50:08,370
What should we do to help him?

695
00:50:09,110 --> 00:50:11,800
His death.

696
00:50:15,200 --> 00:50:17,190
What?

697
00:50:17,190 --> 00:50:21,620
It’s the grudge that has been waiting for hundreds of years.

698
00:50:21,620 --> 00:50:25,540
This cruel destiny must be tied at least once.

699
00:50:25,540 --> 00:50:29,480
Only then will the grudge finally end.

700
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:31,700
Find that woman.

701
00:50:31,700 --> 00:50:33,040
When you find her,

702
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:35,640
if you can hear from her that she loves Deity,

703
00:50:35,640 --> 00:50:37,760
everything will be over.

704
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:40,040
But we don’t even know who that woman is.

705
00:50:40,040 --> 00:50:42,120
How do we find her?

706
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,220
When the time comes...

707
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:49,240
That ring will take him there.

708
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:55,790
But that ring was lost, wasn’t it?

709
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,370
I’ve told you many times.

710
00:50:57,370 --> 00:51:01,160
It’s not lost, it’s back with its owner.

711
00:51:05,130 --> 00:51:06,100
Right.

712
00:51:06,100 --> 00:51:09,120
You have to see it by yourselves to believe it, right?

713
00:51:09,120 --> 00:51:10,650
Okay, let’s go.

714
00:51:10,650 --> 00:51:12,720
Han Gye-jeol must have that ring.

715
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,220
-Let’s go confirm it.
-There’s no need... to confirm.

716
00:51:17,220 --> 00:51:21,470
When the time comes, it’ll take you to her...

717
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:27,870
Here it is.

718
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,690
Why is this...

719
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:37,320
We found it when we burned Do Jin-woo’s clothes.

720
00:51:38,490 --> 00:51:39,890
-Ah!
-What’s wrong?

721
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:40,460
-Look!
-What? Look at what?

722
00:51:40,460 --> 00:51:44,670
The ring. The ring.

723
00:51:44,670 --> 00:51:45,740
Do Jin-woo?

724
00:51:45,740 --> 00:51:47,280
Why did he have this ring?

725
00:51:47,280 --> 00:51:49,240
Why was Do Jin-woo holding this ring?

726
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,040
Just like before,

727
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:53,240
it was the ring that followed you here.

728
00:51:53,240 --> 00:51:55,140
You mean that the ring is with me,

729
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:57,370
and not back with its owner.

730
00:51:57,370 --> 00:51:59,390
Then

731
00:51:59,390 --> 00:52:02,600
Han Gye-jeol is not that woman?

732
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:04,370
Then why did I act like this?

733
00:52:04,370 --> 00:52:05,670
Why couldn’t I kill Han Gye-jeol?

734
00:52:05,670 --> 00:52:08,360
-Why did I get soft?
-Yes.

735
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:10,790
No one thinks she’s pretty. She’s just an ordinary person.

736
00:52:10,790 --> 00:52:12,450
Why are you like this?

737
00:52:12,450 --> 00:52:15,010
Have I become humane because I often come to the Yang world?

738
00:52:15,010 --> 00:52:16,870
Ah, it’s awful!

739
00:52:16,870 --> 00:52:20,270
Stop guessing. You’re not humane at all.

740
00:52:20,270 --> 00:52:22,570
Anyway...

741
00:52:22,570 --> 00:52:25,670
I don’t know what the deity team would do without me.

742
00:52:26,130 --> 00:52:27,290
Do you know anything?

743
00:52:27,290 --> 00:52:28,650
You should know.

744
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:34,280
It’s all because... Han Gye-jeol is innocent.

745
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:36,250
How can there be a person who is innocent?

746
00:52:36,250 --> 00:52:38,570
Nonsense.

747
00:52:38,570 --> 00:52:39,890
I really should go wash my ears.

748
00:52:39,890 --> 00:52:42,900
Jade God seems to have a point.

749
00:52:42,900 --> 00:52:44,650
Horn God, why are you saying that?

750
00:52:44,650 --> 00:52:48,660
When you were condemned, you knew exactly what the charge was.

751
00:52:48,660 --> 00:52:49,560
But

752
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:53,930
is it because you don’t know what Han Gye-jeol’s crime is that you can’t kill her?

753
00:52:55,300 --> 00:52:56,390
The next time you see Han Gye-jeol,

754
00:52:56,390 --> 00:52:59,670
you must make her commit a crime in front of you,

755
00:52:59,670 --> 00:53:02,230
which can make you immediately have the idea of killing her.

756
00:53:02,230 --> 00:53:02,550
Make her commit a crime...

757
00:53:02,550 --> 00:53:04,400
(To be continued)
Make her commit a crime...

758
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:05,880
(To be continued)

759
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:08,620
Why? It’s troublesome.
(To be continued)

760
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:12,100
(To be continued)

761
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:19,970
Do Jin-woo!

762
00:53:23,220 --> 00:53:26,440
What? Is she a person or a truck?

763
00:53:28,530 --> 00:53:31,590
I was distracted for a moment and you ran away?

764
00:53:31,590 --> 00:53:35,870
How do you know I am here?

765
00:53:35,870 --> 00:53:38,150
A mortal can’t do that.

766
00:53:38,150 --> 00:53:40,620
I know because I’m a mortal.

767
00:53:40,620 --> 00:53:44,020
The righteous informants...

768
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:47,080
There are so many of them.

769
00:53:47,660 --> 00:53:49,360
Delete that and get out of here right now.

770
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:52,590
This is the last mercy I can give you.

771
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:55,010
If it’s that easy to get out, I won’t upload it.

772
00:53:55,010 --> 00:53:57,700
So are you going to keep bugging me like this?

773
00:53:57,700 --> 00:53:59,830
Yes, until you get your memory back.

774
00:53:59,830 --> 00:54:00,930
Do Jin-woo won’t come back!

775
00:54:00,930 --> 00:54:03,550
So give up.

776
00:54:03,550 --> 00:54:06,270
Sit here for a second.

777
00:54:09,650 --> 00:54:12,160
Don’t move.

778
00:54:12,690 --> 00:54:13,210
Why?

779
00:54:13,210 --> 00:54:15,650
I have something to give you.

780
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,320
What exactly does she want to give me?

781
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:24,490
Anyway, my unstoppable curiosity is really a problem.

782
00:54:24,490 --> 00:54:26,480
Problem.

783
00:54:27,960 --> 00:54:29,950
What do you want to give me?

784
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:40,250
You let me wait for you just for this?

785
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,970
Have a taste first.

786
00:54:47,460 --> 00:54:52,030
Okay... You took the bribe, so you have to fulfill my wish.

787
00:54:52,030 --> 00:54:55,760
Are you educated in economics but not in morals?

788
00:54:56,330 --> 00:54:59,120
There’s nothing for free.

789
00:54:59,120 --> 00:54:59,980
What is your wish?

790
00:54:59,980 --> 00:55:02,290
Tell me.

791
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:08,400
(Jang Mi-sun)

792
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,130
Does anything come to your mind?

793
00:55:12,130 --> 00:55:13,660
No.

794
00:55:13,660 --> 00:55:16,160
What are you doing?

795
00:55:17,550 --> 00:55:20,600
Look... It’s called memory association.

796
00:55:20,600 --> 00:55:24,860
We need to get your memory back as soon as possible, so please cooperate.

797
00:55:24,860 --> 00:55:26,870
This is Professor Do’s mother,

798
00:55:26,870 --> 00:55:28,520
who died in a medical accident.

799
00:55:28,520 --> 00:55:32,920
You chose me because you needed a witness to the accident.

800
00:55:33,560 --> 00:55:37,410
You don’t even know this. I’m here alone making up my own show?

801
00:55:37,410 --> 00:55:39,990
You’re in love with this guy, right?

802
00:55:40,680 --> 00:55:42,310
Does something come to your mind?

803
00:55:42,310 --> 00:55:44,300
It is said that love and cough cannot be hidden.

804
00:55:44,300 --> 00:55:45,870
You should at least hide it.

805
00:55:45,870 --> 00:55:48,330
You should also consider the feelings of others.

806
00:55:48,330 --> 00:55:50,470
You think I like doing this?

807
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:53,760
It’s related to my job, so I’m trying it out.

808
00:55:53,760 --> 00:55:56,260
What... are you gambling your job for a man?

809
00:55:56,260 --> 00:55:59,020
Is there no one else you can count on?

810
00:55:59,020 --> 00:56:01,100
There’s one other doctor Ji Su-yeon.

811
00:56:01,100 --> 00:56:02,200
Ji Su-yeon?

812
00:56:02,200 --> 00:56:03,540
Then go find her.

813
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:06,600
Why are you bothering me instead of looking for her?

814
00:56:06,600 --> 00:56:09,030
Dr. Ji will never testify.

815
00:56:09,030 --> 00:56:10,820
Because she’s under great threat.

816
00:56:10,820 --> 00:56:12,760
Then you threaten her too.

817
00:56:12,760 --> 00:56:14,430
Threats can’t be made by anyone.

818
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:17,410
I have to know something to threaten her.

819
00:56:17,410 --> 00:56:18,580
Tell me earlier.

820
00:56:18,580 --> 00:56:21,450
I’ll help you with this.

821
00:56:21,450 --> 00:56:22,930
Help me with what?

822
00:56:22,930 --> 00:56:25,590
I’ll help you find her weakness, and you can threaten Ji Su-yeon.

823
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:29,410
Use your desire as an excuse to commit a crime in front of me.

824
00:56:29,410 --> 00:56:32,440
What do you mean by committing a crime?

825
00:56:32,440 --> 00:56:33,750
Why are you helping me all of a sudden?

826
00:56:33,750 --> 00:56:35,880
So that I can kill you in peace.

827
00:56:35,880 --> 00:56:38,100
Ji Su-yeon is the sacrifice.

828
00:56:38,100 --> 00:56:40,300
He’s really sick.

829
00:56:40,300 --> 00:56:42,720
Maybe I should just give upon him.

830
00:56:43,560 --> 00:56:45,590
Okay.

831
00:56:45,590 --> 00:56:48,050
Let’s go, go to kill you.

832
00:56:48,050 --> 00:56:49,810
So,

833
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:57,270
you’re going to help me now, right?

834
00:56:57,270 --> 00:56:58,990
For nothing?

835
00:56:58,990 --> 00:57:00,240
You really misunderstood.

836
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:03,920
Usually, it’s not a favor, it’s a trap, a trick.

837
00:57:03,920 --> 00:57:04,940
Right.

838
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:06,020
I’m already in danger.

839
00:57:06,020 --> 00:57:08,810
I don’t care to be a thief or my conscience.

840
00:57:08,810 --> 00:57:10,050
You’re definitely a mortal.

841
00:57:10,050 --> 00:57:11,850
Yes, this is the mortal I know.

842
00:57:11,850 --> 00:57:14,770
Where’s the Ji Su-yeon you mentioned?

843
00:57:17,350 --> 00:57:20,390
Just close your eyes and lie for me for once.

844
00:57:20,390 --> 00:57:21,760
Why should I close my eyes and lie?

845
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:23,060
Will it work?

846
00:57:23,060 --> 00:57:26,050
Because others don’t know that you have amnesia.

847
00:57:26,050 --> 00:57:30,020
So Han Gye-jeol was entrusted by Professor Do to prosecute

848
00:57:30,020 --> 00:57:32,270
and never betrayed.

849
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:35,310
Just go to the disciplinary committee and say so.

850
00:57:35,310 --> 00:57:38,150
You want me to lie for you,

851
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,120
end up committing a crime like this.

852
00:57:41,120 --> 00:57:42,790
It’s not a lie made out of nothing.

853
00:57:42,790 --> 00:57:46,370
It’s true that you asked me to testify before.

854
00:57:46,370 --> 00:57:49,490
Isn’t that a crime?

855
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:52,540
Then you should have asked for help from the beginning, why do you say that now?

856
00:57:52,540 --> 00:57:57,480
I wasn’t sure that you would help me just now.

857
00:57:57,480 --> 00:57:58,190
Isn’t that true?

858
00:57:58,190 --> 00:58:01,510
Who would lie for a stranger?

859
00:58:01,510 --> 00:58:03,730
What’s the difference now?

860
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:09,050
You said you wanted me to threaten Dr. Ji.
And you said you’d do your best to help me.

861
00:58:09,050 --> 00:58:10,780
Please understand me.

862
00:58:10,780 --> 00:58:14,720
Although I’ve lost my memory, I still have the feelings.

863
00:58:14,720 --> 00:58:18,380
What do you mean by feelings?

864
00:58:18,380 --> 00:58:21,560
The feeling of guilt, the feeling of guilt.

865
00:58:21,560 --> 00:58:23,470
If I testify for you,

866
00:58:23,470 --> 00:58:25,360
will you take down those articles?

867
00:58:25,360 --> 00:58:28,700
And will not come back to me in the future, right?

868
00:58:29,860 --> 00:58:33,830
Of course, I won’t bother you anymore.

869
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:36,820
Because there’s no reason for us

870
00:58:36,820 --> 00:58:39,460
to see each other again.

(Seoul Pilseong Hospital)

873
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,400
Let’s start the disciplinary committee.

874
00:59:04,400 --> 00:59:06,310
Well... I’m very sorry.

875
00:59:06,310 --> 00:59:09,770
Can I make a phone call?

876
00:59:11,320 --> 00:59:13,220
Come on, let’s get started.

877
00:59:13,220 --> 00:59:15,160
We’re all busy after all.

878
00:59:15,160 --> 00:59:18,270
Yes, let’s finish as soon as possible.

(Seoul Pilseong Hospital)

881
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:33,900
I’m Dr. Han’s witness, Do Jin-woo.

882
00:59:36,010 --> 00:59:37,770
Han Gye-jeol claims

883
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:41,150
to have sued the hospital after having a deal with Professor Do,

884
00:59:41,150 --> 00:59:43,420
is that true?

885
00:59:44,190 --> 00:59:46,880
Oh, yes.

886
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:50,430
No, why did you do that?

887
00:59:50,430 --> 00:59:53,220
Because I don’t want to be a doctor who kills people.

888
00:59:53,220 --> 00:59:57,880
I want to expose that the patient Jang Mi-sun died because the CT was switched.

889
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,860
Why was the CT switched?

890
01:00:01,430 --> 01:00:05,810
As far as I know, it was ordered by Chairman Kim Pil-soo.

891
01:00:08,330 --> 01:00:10,240
Do Jin-woo, are you crazy?

892
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:12,680
How could you betray the Chairman for yourself?

893
01:00:12,680 --> 01:00:16,240
You make a mess with this.
Can you still be a doctor?

894
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:18,510
I can’t be a doctor anyway.

895
01:00:18,510 --> 01:00:20,620
What?

896
01:00:21,370 --> 01:00:23,040
Do... Professor?

897
01:00:23,040 --> 01:00:24,780
I’ve lost my memory as Han Gye-jeol wished.

898
01:00:24,780 --> 01:00:26,230
I can’t be a doctor anymore.

899
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:28,500
Could you ask a doctor with amnesia for surgery?

900
01:00:28,500 --> 01:00:29,790
Professor Do!

901
01:00:29,790 --> 01:00:32,420
I’ve done everything you asked me to do.

902
01:00:32,420 --> 01:00:35,960
But you didn’t ask me to hide my amnesia.

903
01:00:42,150 --> 01:00:44,510
Thank you for your hard work.

904
01:00:52,020 --> 01:00:53,680
Professor Do.

905
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:56,790
Professor Do!

906
01:01:00,040 --> 01:01:01,740
Why did you do that?

907
01:01:01,740 --> 01:01:03,420
If you didn’t want to testify, you didn’t have to come.

908
01:01:03,420 --> 01:01:05,800
Why did you come and screw it up? Why?

909
01:01:05,800 --> 01:01:07,630
So that you won’t come to me later.

910
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:08,310
What?

911
01:01:08,310 --> 01:01:10,170
I’ve studied the social media.

912
01:01:10,170 --> 01:01:12,000
In a world where everyone can lie,

913
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:15,270
once you’re branded as a liar, no one believes you anymore.

914
01:01:15,270 --> 01:01:17,610
What happened today will be known by everyone.

915
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:20,270
And in the world, no matter what you say, no one believes you anymore.

916
01:01:20,270 --> 01:01:22,570
Even if you play all the tricks to see me,

917
01:01:22,570 --> 01:01:25,130
you won’t be able to find me anymore.

918
01:01:25,130 --> 01:01:26,830
I told you that

919
01:01:26,830 --> 01:01:31,620
when this was over, there would be no reason for us to see each other again.

920
01:01:31,620 --> 01:01:34,770
Why would I find someone who is useless?

921
01:01:36,560 --> 01:01:38,350
Use.

922
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:42,980
I’m sure you’ll make up some irrelevant use to find me,

923
01:01:42,980 --> 01:01:45,170
and see me no matter what excuse you make.

924
01:01:45,170 --> 01:01:48,760
Because you are full of love for Do Jin-woo.

925
01:01:48,760 --> 01:01:53,930
Your eyes are filled with the kind of fondness that makes mortals so stupid.

926
01:01:53,930 --> 01:01:56,320
Your mind is clear, but your heart can’t stop.

927
01:01:56,320 --> 01:01:58,900
I’m sure you’ll find any excuse to pester me,

928
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:03,120
and make excuses by saying it’ll disappear.

929
01:02:03,620 --> 01:02:05,520
I hate you.

930
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,410
I’m sick of that kind of attachment.

931
01:02:08,410 --> 01:02:12,550
So don’t pester me anymore.

932
01:02:17,110 --> 01:02:22,450
Yes, I’m stupid. So what?

933
01:02:26,450 --> 01:02:29,850
I knew I’d be used, but I’m willing to be played by you.

934
01:02:29,850 --> 01:02:31,710
I’m aware of your betrayal,

935
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,800
but I understand you and think you’re heartbroken.

936
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:35,200
If my friend had done this to me,

937
01:02:35,200 --> 01:02:37,590
I would have hit her in the back and told her she was crazy.

938
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:42,400
But now that it’s my business, my heart is out my control.

939
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:45,220
Because I’ve fallen in love with you who saved my life.

940
01:02:45,220 --> 01:02:48,590
Because I can’t help but like you who is willing to be my support.

941
01:02:48,590 --> 01:02:52,160
Because you are the first person who said you would be responsible for me.

942
01:02:52,160 --> 01:02:54,630
I just want to believe you.

943
01:02:54,630 --> 01:02:59,190
So the one who can criticize me for being stupid, it’s me.

944
01:02:59,190 --> 01:03:02,360
Who are you to accuse me of being stupid?

945
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:05,410
You need to apologize first!

946
01:03:06,040 --> 01:03:07,030
Where are you going?

947
01:03:07,030 --> 01:03:10,320
Kneel down in front of me and apologize.

948
01:03:12,360 --> 01:03:13,570
Don’t you understand what I’m saying?

949
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,660
It’s useless to say it, so there’s no need to say it.

950
01:03:15,660 --> 01:03:17,080
Anyway, it’s really stupid.

951
01:03:17,080 --> 01:03:22,180
You should ask for forgiveness until I forgive you. Hey!

952
01:03:23,000 --> 01:03:24,270
Oh, Oh, shit!

953
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:27,270
What’s wrong? What happens? Crazy?

954
01:03:28,470 --> 01:03:31,560
What’s wrong with my legs? What’s wrong with my legs?

955
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:36,540
Yes, I did do something stupid.

956
01:03:36,540 --> 01:03:39,460
I admit it. Let go of me first.

957
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:43,540
Is it

958
01:03:44,020 --> 01:03:45,450
not because I am soft-hearted?

959
01:03:45,450 --> 01:03:49,910
Kneel down in front of me and apologize!

960
01:03:51,850 --> 01:03:53,770
No, I won’t kneel.

961
01:03:53,770 --> 01:03:55,530
I stand and resist in front of the Creator.

962
01:03:55,530 --> 01:03:59,560
Impossible. Don’t do this. Stop.

963
01:04:06,520 --> 01:04:09,650
I... How could I obey Han Gye-jeol?

964
01:04:10,770 --> 01:04:12,320
Who are you?

965
01:04:12,320 --> 01:04:14,660
Who the hell are you?

966
01:04:19,040 --> 01:04:21,760
Perhaps...

967
01:04:21,760 --> 01:04:24,830
Do you know this ring?

968
01:04:26,080 --> 01:04:28,200
What... What? What if I know?

969
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,500
Do you know it? Do you?

970
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:48,600
I’ll protect you, Seol Hui.

971
01:04:50,190 --> 01:04:52,390
Are you Seol Hui?

972
01:04:55,160 --> 01:04:57,490
Are you Seol Hui?

973
01:05:34,980 --> 01:05:37,110
(Next episode preview)

974
01:05:37,590 --> 01:05:38,570
Don’t appear in front of me again.

975
01:05:38,570 --> 01:05:39,860
(Thanks to special appearance by Kim Kang-hoon)
Don’t appear in front of me again.

976
01:05:39,860 --> 01:05:40,370
Han Gye-jeol, you can’t leave me.
(Thanks to special appearance by Kim Kang-hoon)

977
01:05:40,370 --> 01:05:41,690
Han Gye-jeol, you can’t leave me.

978
01:05:41,690 --> 01:05:42,960
Why are you doing this to me?

979
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,860
I want to be with you.

980
01:05:44,860 --> 01:05:47,540
If you want to be with me, then do something nice.

981
01:05:47,540 --> 01:05:49,530
Do you want money or a hospital? Just tell me.

982
01:05:49,530 --> 01:05:50,930
Are you kidding me?

983
01:05:50,930 --> 01:05:52,240
What do I have to do for you to like me?

984
01:05:52,240 --> 01:05:53,670
I want to be with someone who doesn’t have to do anything.

985
01:05:53,670 --> 01:05:55,660
Even if he does nothing, I will also like him.

986
01:05:55,660 --> 01:05:57,240
There must be someone

987
01:05:57,240 --> 01:05:59,590
who is destined to be somewhere.

988
01:05:59,590 --> 01:06:00,740
Let’s try to be together.

989
01:06:00,740 --> 01:06:01,890
Okay.

990
01:06:01,890 --> 01:06:05,610
So, do we count today as the first day of our relationship?
