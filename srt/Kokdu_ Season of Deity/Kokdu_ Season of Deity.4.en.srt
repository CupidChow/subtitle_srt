7
00:00:49,310 --> 00:00:56,460
Do you know my mom?

8
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,860
I know both of you and your mom very well.

9
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,380
Gye-jeol.

10
00:01:11,420 --> 00:01:12,280
Mom.

11
00:01:22,660 --> 00:01:23,530
Mom!

12
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,900
Mom, mom.

13
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:43,120
Mom, mom, what happened to you?

14
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:02,620
The path of the dead
led by the most wanted voices.

15
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:12,290
The path of the dead
led by the people most wanted to see.

16
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,580
Gye-jeol.

17
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:29,380
The cruel dream of the dead who cannot bear to let go.

18
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,020
You madman!

19
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:48,810
Madman, why did it become like this?

20
00:02:49,160 --> 00:02:52,730
It keeps slashing at me like a blade with a sharpened edge.

21
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:58,120
In the time when all I wanted was for this to end,

22
00:03:03,230 --> 00:03:09,130
♫Like a secret, as the seasons pass♫

23
00:03:10,630 --> 00:03:17,300
this song was like the dew that
comes after a long drought.

29
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:00,250
Gye-jeol.

30
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:11,590
Don’t know how many dead people
I have extradited in the countless years,

31
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:17,240
but it is the first time
I receive a gift from the dead.

32
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,650
What, the dead?

33
00:04:44,570 --> 00:04:46,670
Since I have received the gift,
I should do something for you.

34
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:50,090
If you have any wishes,
just tell me.

35
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,840
Is it to make your road to hades
a flower road?

36
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:57,840
Or to help you end
the earthly cycle of reincarnation.

37
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:01,050
Not bound by the physical body,

38
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,310
and become a breeze is good.

39
00:05:04,890 --> 00:05:05,690
Then,

40
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:12,830
can I ask for a wish for my daughter,

41
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:15,550
instead of for myself?

42
00:05:16,490 --> 00:05:17,150
Your daughter?

43
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:19,180
If you meet my daughter,

44
00:05:20,490 --> 00:05:22,480
could you take care of her for me?

45
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:27,180
Just give her whatever
she wants as you can.

46
00:05:29,570 --> 00:05:30,510
Take care of her?

47
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:35,420
Your daughter may not be alive
when she meets me.

48
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,180
I'm worried because
her mother died young,

49
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,360
she will grow up prematurely

50
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:46,820
at a young age.

51
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:50,090
No matter in the underworld or the world,

52
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:54,390
even once in my daughter’s life,

53
00:05:56,470 --> 00:05:58,830
there would be somebody
who could be like her mother,

54
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:02,650
and do anything for her.

55
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:06,000
Fine, I promise you.

56
00:06:07,780 --> 00:06:08,870
If I encounter that kid,

57
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:10,510
I will say yes whatever she wants.

58
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:17,710
You’ll really give her everything?

59
00:06:18,630 --> 00:06:19,620
Don’t worry.

60
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:23,460
Even the God himself cannot
break the promise he made.

61
00:06:30,900 --> 00:06:36,150
Excuse me, do you know my mother?

62
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:41,470
Of course, I know you
and your mother

63
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,010
since a long time ago.

64
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:46,520
Didn’t you say that
you don’t know her?

65
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,490
You said you don’t know
when I asked you last time.

66
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:53,770
It’s certain that Do Jin-woo cannot know all the history of these fates.

67
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,670
Only the Deity knows.

68
00:06:57,700 --> 00:07:01,530
Jeong In-ju
Born in the Dragon year of A-Chen

69
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,780
Aged 37

70
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:06,920
Do you really know my mom?

71
00:07:08,620 --> 00:07:11,070
How do you know her?
Where did you meet her?

72
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:14,100
On the road where all of you
will leave someday.

73
00:07:14,740 --> 00:07:15,510
On the road?

74
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:20,030
Did you get ill when you were a child, Deity?

75
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:22,840
My mom worked in the Emergency Center.

76
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,410
Is it because you were uncomfortable that you met her?

77
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:26,280
You could say that
I was uncomfortable.

78
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,620
Because it’s always hard and painful on that road.

79
00:07:29,250 --> 00:07:32,300
Normally, the humans will brazen and let off steam at their last minute.

80
00:07:32,820 --> 00:07:34,240
So your mother was very weird.

81
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,470
She ought to have many to say, but she was only singing.

82
00:07:40,409 --> 00:07:42,320
Deity, you are very good
at moaning for nothing, right?

83
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,370
Moaning for nothing? Do you know how painful that is?

84
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:49,720
Well, I guess so. Kids are like that.

85
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,690
They will cry like the world has ended,

86
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,670
even if just with a thorn in the hand.

87
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,690
Kids? Huh.

88
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,790
I was like that, too.

89
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,920
I didn’t know if it’s because
I was uncomfortable or sad,

90
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,290
I couldn’t stop crying.

91
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:04,430
If I kept whimpering, my mom would sing.

92
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,700
Strangely enough,
if I listened to my mom sing,

93
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:09,520
I would relax and want to sleep.

94
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:13,560
You must be very good
at moaning for nothing

95
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,850
that my mother would
sing for you to comfort you.

96
00:08:16,420 --> 00:08:20,020
So your mom was comforting me, right?

97
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:24,220
She is pretty, isn’t she?

98
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:25,570
She looks just like you.

99
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:27,230
I understood after I saw you.

100
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:31,140
I look like my dad,

101
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,549
I would be more beautiful
if I look like my mother.

102
00:08:33,549 --> 00:08:34,590
You should feel lucky,

103
00:08:35,130 --> 00:08:36,510
because the beauties are always fleeting,

104
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,549
and the ugly things last long.

105
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:41,190
You will live a long life,

106
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,650
maybe you will break the record.

107
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,430
Thanks for your blessing.

108
00:08:47,430 --> 00:08:49,790
I want to live a long life,

109
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,730
I don’t want to wither after
blooming for a season like my mother,

110
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:57,710
because the ones left will
be painful for a long time.

111
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,350
Why will they feel painful?

112
00:09:01,610 --> 00:09:04,040
Forgetting is human’s specialty
and the only privilege.

113
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,260
Just forget it as you want.

114
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,650
Thank you.

115
00:09:08,150 --> 00:09:09,960
Thanks what?
Thank me for letting you forget?

116
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:11,760
Thank you that you can remember.

117
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:16,580
Thank you for meeting my mother
and remembering her.

118
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,080
And thank you for
talking about her with me.

119
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,270
Really, thousands of thanks.

120
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:46,750
It’s amazing.

121
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,620
Even it’s said like this,
it’s hard to believe.

122
00:09:50,570 --> 00:09:52,030
It seems that the fate is the fate.

123
00:09:52,580 --> 00:09:53,910
It’s not fate.

124
00:09:55,780 --> 00:09:59,310
That song was like the dew
that comes after a long drought.

125
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:01,480
I was just slightly intoxicated
by the rain.

126
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:02,250
If I had to say it,

127
00:10:02,250 --> 00:10:06,490
you are the drunken accident
after being intoxicated by the rain.

128
00:10:06,490 --> 00:10:09,640
How can you say that
people are drunken accidents?

129
00:10:10,820 --> 00:10:15,560
If this is not fate,
what do you think is fate?

130
00:10:16,810 --> 00:10:17,630
Seol Hui.

131
00:10:18,580 --> 00:10:19,400
Seol Hui?

132
00:10:22,140 --> 00:10:23,410
The only salvation?

133
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:26,670
Oh, did you find that people?

134
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:30,360
I thought I find her.

135
00:10:31,080 --> 00:10:34,390
Because I believe that there’s only one
woman can make me so captivated,

136
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:38,110
but I didn’t know I was trapped by the trap I set myself and couldn’t move.

137
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:42,040
You don’t even know what she looks like,

138
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:44,410
how could you know that I am not her?

139
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,660
How about confirming that now?

140
00:10:46,660 --> 00:10:47,580
How?

141
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:48,720
Let’s kiss.

142
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,540
What?

143
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:03,580
Food and Drug Safety Agency says
food poisoning cases are increasing.

144
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,710
People are advised to
watch their dietary intake.

145
00:11:06,280 --> 00:11:07,240
Next piece of news.

146
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:12,850
The largest drug trafficking organization,
the Black Bear Faction broke through the circle of police and escaped.

147
00:11:13,240 --> 00:11:17,620
Two police officers died during the arrest and more than ten were seriously injured.

148
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,340
Around 11:00 last night...

149
00:11:22,170 --> 00:11:23,740
Go to hell!

150
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,190
-Stop!
-Go to hell! Go to hell!

151
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:30,290
-What?
-Go to hell! Go to hell!

152
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:32,070
I let you to stop the car! Stop the car!
Haven’t you heard that?

153
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:36,970
Deity, what happened to you?

154
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,500
Deity, are you uncomfortable?

155
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:13,750
Obviously, someone was hit!

156
00:12:22,830 --> 00:12:23,980
There was a car accident here.

157
00:12:24,440 --> 00:12:26,560
I think I hit someone,
but I can't find the victim.

158
00:12:27,260 --> 00:12:30,410
This is... this is near Gwaebang Mountain.

159
00:12:30,410 --> 00:12:31,430
Please come quickly.

160
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,950
Deity, Deity, you’ve seen that
someone was hit, right?

161
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:40,350
Deity?

162
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:54,380
Hurry up! We have to go now!

163
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,120
I'll be right there.

164
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:02,990
You crazy bastard! How dare you report me to the police!

165
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:08,010
The police will be here soon.

166
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,020
I’m going to leave this country.

167
00:13:11,610 --> 00:13:12,370
Have a good trip.

168
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:30,060
Hey, who’s that?

169
00:13:35,590 --> 00:13:37,100
Are you crazy, bastard?

170
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:39,220
Go on!

171
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,050
I’ve had enough of this!

172
00:15:30,140 --> 00:15:32,270
If you want to kill, then kill by yourself!

173
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:35,620
Or just kill me!

174
00:15:44,780 --> 00:15:49,840
Meat tastes better
when there's blood dripping down.

175
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:52,600
What…

176
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,690
Even if it's 2+ meat, it is no use!

177
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:55,990
Because of that picky Deity

178
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:58,210
we can only eat well-done meat.

179
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,900
If you see blood every night,
do you want to see blood?

180
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:03,530
How gross will it be?

181
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:05,380
You have to bear it even it is inconvenient.

182
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:08,280
The curse of Lord Deity will be lifted soon.

183
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:10,030
You can grill your meat
as you like at that time.

184
00:16:11,890 --> 00:16:13,940
How could the curse be lifted so easily?

185
00:16:15,210 --> 00:16:19,280
It will only be lifted when Han Gye-jeol
says that she loves Lord Deity.

186
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:20,290
How could it be so easy?

187
00:16:20,670 --> 00:16:21,450
I love you.

188
00:16:23,030 --> 00:16:24,370
Who are you confessing love to?

189
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:27,460
Will it be so hard to hear
Han Gye-jeol say that?

190
00:16:27,460 --> 00:16:28,730
If it’s so difficult,

191
00:16:29,640 --> 00:16:30,800
how do they have babies?

192
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:33,340
My dear, the baby said it wants tenderloin.

193
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:35,700
Hey, to be honest, is Deity normal people?

194
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:38,700
He has a bad temper,
and kills people all the time.

195
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:40,700
If you were Han, can you say
“I love you” to him so easily?

196
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:42,640
I don’t think the personality
of Lord Deity is that bad.

197
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,720
Just wake up, you woman
who only cares about appearance!

198
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:46,960
He becomes so tired
because he was forced to kill people.

199
00:16:47,310 --> 00:16:50,020
To be honest, if he is a true bad person,
will he be so uncomfortable?

200
00:16:50,020 --> 00:16:51,270
He must be so happy to be able to kill people,

201
00:16:51,270 --> 00:16:52,310
and never think of lifting the curse.

202
00:16:52,310 --> 00:16:55,190
But he said he would rather die

203
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,550
than have bloody hands.

204
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,560
Isn’t that his kindness?

205
00:17:11,550 --> 00:17:13,530
Lord Deity.

206
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,740
You’re back.

207
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:17,150
Is it beautiful?

208
00:17:18,900 --> 00:17:19,800
Oh my god!

209
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,130
Romanee-Conti.

210
00:17:21,130 --> 00:17:22,260
That is expensive, very expensive.

211
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,760
Not that one. Not that one.

212
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,140
Please, please, please, give it to me,
give it to me, give it to me.

213
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,470
Stop joking.

214
00:17:38,670 --> 00:17:40,590
I was wrong. I was wrong.

215
00:17:42,090 --> 00:17:42,870
Give it to me.

216
00:17:49,860 --> 00:17:54,180
20 million won.

217
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:56,120
20 mil… You…

218
00:17:57,420 --> 00:17:58,910
Why you beat me? Why you beat me?

219
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:01,400
What did I do wrong?

220
00:18:02,310 --> 00:18:04,130
They're the ones who did it wrong.

221
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,410
You guys…

222
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:10,900
How can you fall
when being asked to fall?

223
00:18:12,060 --> 00:18:13,570
You should learn how to fly.

224
00:18:15,230 --> 00:18:16,590
What nonsense you are talking?

225
00:18:16,590 --> 00:18:18,980
How can they learn how to fly?

226
00:18:18,980 --> 00:18:20,100
Right?

227
00:18:21,300 --> 00:18:22,930
It’s nonsense.

228
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:28,180
When being asked to fall, just fall.

229
00:18:28,180 --> 00:18:31,270
Who do you think you are,
that dare to have hope?

230
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:33,360
Isn’t it said that during a long fall,

231
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:35,540
it is possible to learn how to fly?

232
00:18:37,170 --> 00:18:39,810
What flying ability?

233
00:18:39,810 --> 00:18:43,100
I’m the reason you barely fly.

234
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:45,330
What’s the matter?

235
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:46,770
Han Gye-jeol, she…

236
00:18:48,620 --> 00:18:50,460
She seems not to be Seol Hui.

237
00:18:50,460 --> 00:18:54,410
What are you talking about?
Didn’t you say that you were very sure.

238
00:18:55,580 --> 00:18:58,460
Maybe the Creator has fooled me again.

239
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:00,940
Why would he do this?

240
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,630
How he hopes that Lord Deity
could get his relief from the pain.

241
00:19:04,630 --> 00:19:06,160
Relief.

242
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,360
Can I have that?

243
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,440
That is a carrot in front of my head

244
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:15,180
to torture me.

245
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,880
Letting me put all my hope in the only carrot

246
00:19:17,880 --> 00:19:20,680
to let me keep running.

247
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:25,320
Because he knows that
I will be less painful.

248
00:19:28,490 --> 00:19:31,890
So, I have decided…

249
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,170
I will keep going on desperately.

250
00:19:35,170 --> 00:19:38,050
What has happened? Stop doing this!

251
00:19:38,050 --> 00:19:43,050
I will not do anything the Creator wishes.

252
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:46,180
It’s said that in the place
where people are full of despair,

253
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:49,880
the gods cannot stay, no matter of their kind.

254
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,550
I can't believe God is desperate!

255
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:56,970
And I don't need to see the Creator anymore.

256
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,640
How good is it!

257
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:27,680
Mom,

258
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:31,790
should I not stay here anymore?

259
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:36,960
I don't think it's a good idea
to get used to receiving.

260
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,570
I know.

261
00:20:42,430 --> 00:20:45,330
But I just always want to be pampered.

262
00:20:47,290 --> 00:20:49,300
He is not my mother.

263
00:20:56,970 --> 00:20:57,910
Deity?

264
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:00,700
Deity.

265
00:21:10,070 --> 00:21:11,370
Master.

266
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:13,450
What Deity you are calling?

267
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,120
(Han Gye-jeol)

268
00:21:37,460 --> 00:21:40,470
So noisy! So noisy!

269
00:21:40,470 --> 00:21:42,580
Who’s that? In such an early time?

270
00:21:46,500 --> 00:21:47,280
(Han Gye-jeol)

271
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,550
Deity.
(Han Gye-jeol)

272
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:51,420
I have hung up, what happened?

273
00:21:51,420 --> 00:21:53,660
What time is it, just get up.

274
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:02,250
Ah, the fucking drunken accident,
I should give up drinking.

275
00:22:02,250 --> 00:22:04,490
I have something to say,
can you come to the hospital to see me?

276
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:07,050
I can’t, I won’t.

277
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,570
See you after 20 minutes!

278
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:11,030
(Han Gye-jeol)

279
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:13,350
Ah, Han Gye-jeol.

280
00:22:13,350 --> 00:22:15,390
Why is she so arrogant?

281
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,560
What should I do?

282
00:22:28,230 --> 00:22:29,360
Ah, I’m scared to death.

283
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,040
What?

284
00:22:33,040 --> 00:22:34,180
Why do you call me here?

285
00:22:34,180 --> 00:22:36,580
Just tell me the point, I’m very busy.

286
00:22:44,010 --> 00:22:45,460
Where to go?

287
00:22:45,460 --> 00:22:48,010
Let’s get in first, let’s have our conversation inside.

288
00:22:48,010 --> 00:22:49,920
Don’t you know the meaning of in short?

289
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,590
You mean you don’t want to get in?

290
00:22:54,590 --> 00:22:56,690
Well, it’s fine to talk about it outside.

291
00:22:56,690 --> 00:23:00,380
To be simple, haven’t you learned Korean?

292
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,390
So obedient,

293
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:12,540
why you acted like that yesterday

294
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,410
you such a good boy?

295
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,740
Yesterday? What happened yesterday?

296
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:18,440
Just, how can you leave a girl alone at night?

297
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:19,720
What if something happened?

298
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:22,010
Something would happen
if you were with me.

299
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:24,620
You should thank me for
how hard it was to endure that late.

300
00:23:26,080 --> 00:23:29,620
Why? What would happen?

301
00:23:31,460 --> 00:23:32,710
What are you holding back for?

302
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,260
There must be something dirty in your ears.

303
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,620
Ah, you…

304
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,030
Is it fun to tease me all the time?

305
00:23:39,030 --> 00:23:41,900
No, so didn’t I let you to tell me in short?

306
00:23:41,900 --> 00:23:45,540
Why do you talk so much?
The more you talk, the shorter your life will be. Don't you understand?

307
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:48,830
I don’t. At least I have to live ten more years.

308
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:49,540
Why?

309
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:52,160
As I’ve paid the rent for 10 years,
I have to gain it back.

310
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,880
What? When did you pay it?

311
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:01,510
I paid it to you, 100 million won.

312
00:24:02,830 --> 00:24:04,730
The master has lent it to me.

313
00:24:04,730 --> 00:24:06,830
That’s great.

314
00:24:06,830 --> 00:24:08,950
Oh, weak people should help each other.

315
00:24:08,950 --> 00:24:11,360
Well, seems good, bye then.

316
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:17,230
Deity, are you angry?

317
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:19,180
Angry? Me?

318
00:24:19,180 --> 00:24:20,390
Why?

319
00:24:20,390 --> 00:24:22,120
Because I didn’t say anything about dating.

320
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,070
No, no. You misunderstood.

321
00:24:24,070 --> 00:24:25,960
This is a big misunderstanding.

322
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,710
You gave me money and this hospital,

323
00:24:27,710 --> 00:24:29,480
and showed me the evidence that we’re fated.

324
00:24:29,480 --> 00:24:31,220
Deity, you’ve done everything you can.

325
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:34,840
But I’ve been pretending not to know so you must be mad.

326
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:38,610
What the hell did I do yesterday?

327
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,450
After all, I’m a girl.

328
00:24:40,450 --> 00:24:43,080
It’s kind of hard for me to start the conversation.

329
00:24:43,080 --> 00:24:43,860
Don’t do it if it’s hard.

330
00:24:43,860 --> 00:24:44,500
Just do the simple things.

331
00:24:44,500 --> 00:24:45,640
Life is short.

332
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:47,130
But I’ve decided.

333
00:24:47,130 --> 00:24:48,460
I told you not to do it.

334
00:24:48,460 --> 00:24:49,270
Can’t you hear me?

335
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:50,030
Do you have one ear?

336
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,340
Let’s keep it ambiguous first.

337
00:24:52,570 --> 00:24:53,440
What?

338
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,510
Ambiguous.

339
00:24:54,510 --> 00:24:56,690
Getting to know each other slowly.

340
00:24:56,690 --> 00:24:58,770
I told you my time in the world is short.

341
00:24:58,770 --> 00:25:00,250
It’s impossible.

342
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,500
It won’t take long.

343
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,570
I promise you.

344
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:10,430
Stop!

345
00:25:13,670 --> 00:25:14,710
Considering our relationship now,

346
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,310
can you do me a favor?

347
00:25:16,310 --> 00:25:17,310
What?

348
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:21,980
I have to register at the health center and see the plaque.

349
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:24,520
I don’t feel easy about letting the hospital empty.

350
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,370
Can you help me keep an eye on the hospital?

351
00:25:26,370 --> 00:25:28,830
What’s the need to do so?

352
00:25:28,830 --> 00:25:34,220
Isn’t it because someone prepared
some very expensive equipment?

353
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:39,800
It seems you really want to impress me.

354
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:43,120
Disappear.

355
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,040
Disappear quickly, yesterday’s me.

356
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:58,010
See you tomorrow.

357
00:26:00,530 --> 00:26:02,970
(Feiyun Clinic)

358
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:03,680
Move a little bit more.
(Feiyun Clinic)

359
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:05,190
A little bit more to the left.
(Feiyun Clinic)

360
00:26:05,190 --> 00:26:05,870
A little bit more to the left.

361
00:26:05,870 --> 00:26:07,850
Okay, stop, stop, stop!

362
00:26:09,060 --> 00:26:10,040
Just a little more.

363
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,670
A little bit more to the left.

364
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:13,520
Yes, yes. Thanks.

365
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:18,400
I’ve been here. Okay?

366
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:20,170
Wait!

367
00:26:26,050 --> 00:26:26,330
(Feiyun Clinic, Director, Han Gye-jeol)

368
00:26:26,330 --> 00:26:27,130
Here you are.
(Feiyun Clinic, Director, Han Gye-jeol)

369
00:26:28,220 --> 00:26:30,740
I want to give it to you first.

370
00:26:30,740 --> 00:26:32,020
Because you’re the Lord?

371
00:26:32,980 --> 00:26:35,430
I can never be anyone’s Lord.

372
00:26:35,430 --> 00:26:37,500
Because I can’t be anyone’s salvation.

373
00:26:37,500 --> 00:26:38,840
Let’s wait and see.

374
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:41,450
You’ll soon become a salvation.

375
00:26:54,730 --> 00:26:56,060
Is this salvation?

376
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,140
What kind of salvation is this?

377
00:26:58,910 --> 00:27:00,420
Of course!

378
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:02,910
There are so many patients who desperately need us.

379
00:27:02,910 --> 00:27:04,300
This is definitely salvation.

380
00:27:05,470 --> 00:27:07,720
Why do I have to go with you?

381
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:10,030
Because I haven’t hired a nurse yet.

382
00:27:10,030 --> 00:27:12,990
All you have to do is hold the catheter for me.

383
00:27:12,990 --> 00:27:15,780
Catheter?

384
00:27:20,740 --> 00:27:23,240
How can I be a nurse?

385
00:27:23,600 --> 00:27:25,280
How can I work at my age?

386
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:29,230
According to the Constitution,
only people below 65 are forced to work.

387
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:30,630
I can’t do that.

388
00:27:30,630 --> 00:27:32,470
I’m a person with a strong sense of law.

389
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,130
If you want to obey the rules of human law,

390
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:36,620
I respect your choice.

391
00:27:36,620 --> 00:27:37,660
Thank you.

392
00:27:37,660 --> 00:27:39,480
However,

393
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,410
you live by my laws in my house, right?

394
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,110
What?

395
00:27:44,140 --> 00:27:45,470
Go to hang.

396
00:27:45,470 --> 00:27:47,340
You’ve always seen Ok Shin do that.

397
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:49,020
So it must not be a problem for you, right?

398
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:50,200
Lord Deity,

399
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:52,070
how could you do this to me?

400
00:27:53,990 --> 00:27:55,330
Lord Deity, you might not know that

401
00:27:55,330 --> 00:27:58,290
I’m a famous Youtuber in this life,

402
00:27:58,290 --> 00:27:59,410
naming Legendary God.

403
00:27:59,410 --> 00:28:00,810
And I even won a gold medal.

404
00:28:00,810 --> 00:28:03,830
I’m too famous to work in disguise.

405
00:28:03,830 --> 00:28:04,850
What a pity.

406
00:28:05,970 --> 00:28:08,130
She wears a mask in the video
because she doesn’t want to show her face.

407
00:28:08,130 --> 00:28:08,720
So no one will recognize her.

408
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:10,750
Are you crazy?

409
00:28:10,750 --> 00:28:15,750
Yeah, if Gak Shin wants to be a Youtuber,
I’ll definitely support.

410
00:28:15,750 --> 00:28:19,830
But you’re meant to be a nurse.

411
00:28:21,140 --> 00:28:22,970
If you want to know why,

412
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:26,780
that’s because I’ll leave you hanging
until you want to be a nurse.

413
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:38,260
How’s it going?

414
00:28:38,260 --> 00:28:40,530
This outfit shows that I’m tough
and want to run away, doesn’t it?

415
00:28:40,530 --> 00:28:42,330
Qualified!

416
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:43,970
How can you decide that without asking anything?

417
00:28:43,970 --> 00:28:45,710
At least read my resume.

418
00:28:45,710 --> 00:28:47,630
Ah, alright.

419
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,850
(Resume)

420
00:28:54,930 --> 00:28:58,960
Ms. Seo Bok-gyeong, your work experience is blank.

421
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,280
Yes, blank.

422
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,090
I’ve never met a nurse without experience.

423
00:29:05,090 --> 00:29:07,140
I’m not qualified, right?

424
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:09,350
No, no.

425
00:29:09,350 --> 00:29:10,490
You can learn.

426
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:11,770
We’re short of hands here.

427
00:29:11,770 --> 00:29:13,020
You can get the hang of it soon.

428
00:29:14,650 --> 00:29:17,460
Then I’ll tell you my requests.

429
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:18,250
Working hours depends on my mood.

430
00:29:18,250 --> 00:29:19,550
Get off work on time.

431
00:29:19,550 --> 00:29:20,840
No cleaning, no overtime work.

432
00:29:20,840 --> 00:29:22,920
Don’t try to get me to do more than I’m supposed to.

433
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,840
My dream is to make money while lying down.

434
00:29:26,110 --> 00:29:27,820
No problem.

435
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:40,100
Shit?

436
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:56,880
Bear it.

437
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:28,060
Lord Deity, I’m back.

438
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,030
That woman is really strange.

439
00:30:30,030 --> 00:30:31,600
She’s a big weirdo.

440
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:32,570
I know.

441
00:30:32,570 --> 00:30:34,310
So I asked you to handle it.

442
00:30:34,310 --> 00:30:35,510
Why so many calls?

443
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:38,030
Why so much work?

444
00:30:38,030 --> 00:30:39,550
She’s not bad after all.

445
00:30:39,550 --> 00:30:42,090
It’ll be busy all the time.

446
00:30:42,090 --> 00:30:43,450
Lord Deity,

447
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:45,650
if that happens again, I’ll make her bankrupt.

448
00:30:45,650 --> 00:30:47,280
As soon as word gets out that Legendary God is there,

449
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,870
the hospital will be easily ruined in a month.

450
00:30:48,870 --> 00:30:49,760
That’s great.

451
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,830
If you can take this opportunity to
get her out of my sight forever,

452
00:30:51,830 --> 00:30:53,320
I’ll owe you one.

453
00:30:53,320 --> 00:30:54,830
Lord Deity,

454
00:30:54,830 --> 00:30:56,710
even if she’s not Seol Hui,

455
00:30:56,710 --> 00:30:58,210
why did you do all this?

456
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:03,220
I don’t want Han Gye-jeol to become an adult.

457
00:31:06,050 --> 00:31:08,720
I already said it was over.

458
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:10,660
But she foolishly thought it was just intermission.

459
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,300
So I hate it.

460
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:15,240
I hate myself who cares about all this all the time.

461
00:31:29,590 --> 00:31:31,690
Have a nice dinner.

462
00:31:33,670 --> 00:31:34,810
(Are you still sleeping?
Deity, get up.
Your health is going to be very bad if you don’t eat breakfast.
I haven’t had time to have lunch, I’m so hungry now.
Have a nice dinner.)

463
00:31:40,660 --> 00:31:42,270
Did he read it but choose not to reply?

464
00:31:42,270 --> 00:31:44,740
I said we would be intimate, but I didn’t say I would fight him.

465
00:31:47,490 --> 00:31:49,810
Is he playing hard to get?

466
00:31:49,810 --> 00:31:51,380
I don’t know what to do.

467
00:31:53,730 --> 00:31:55,220
Why isn’t he back?

468
00:31:55,220 --> 00:31:56,430
The food has gone cold.

469
00:32:00,360 --> 00:32:02,330
(Case summary

Continued search for planned crime or possible accomplice)

471
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:10,380
What kind of psycho kills a person like that?

472
00:32:10,380 --> 00:32:13,040
How long has it been in the fridge to look like this?

473
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:16,390
It hasn’t been ten minutes since I last saw Choe Gwang-mo.

474
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,980
What did the scientific search team say?

475
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:19,270
Is it liquid nitrogen?

476
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:20,630
They said to make a body look like that,

477
00:32:20,630 --> 00:32:22,310
a big tank of liquid nitrogen was needed.

478
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:25,260
There’s no sign of anything that big being moved to the hospital.

479
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,190
There’s no specific method or tools found at the scene.

480
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:30,340
What about that car?

481
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,650
You didn’t find out anything?

482
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:33,480
The dashcam has been ruined.

483
00:32:33,480 --> 00:32:36,500
The cameras along the way are broken.

484
00:32:36,500 --> 00:32:39,390
The car belongs to Bulhwa Company.

485
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,930
They said it had been stolen.

486
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:42,060

(Together with the people! Future with hope!)

488
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:43,880
Because of this matter,

489
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,870
a promising Seoul detective like you
has been sent to this village.

490
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:50,320
It’s really hard for you.

491
00:32:50,320 --> 00:32:52,460
That’s also good.

492
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:56,280
I can’t take losing.

493
00:32:56,280 --> 00:33:01,140
That guy, I’ll catch him myself.

494
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:08,420
A rare moment of peace.

495

Answer the phone!

499
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:30,390
Why are my auditory hallucinations in surround sound?

500
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,500
What happened to my hand?

501
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,110
Damn it! No! Ah!

502
00:33:36,140 --> 00:33:37,500
What are you doing here?

503
00:33:43,390 --> 00:33:44,260
Are you a dragonfly?

504
00:33:44,260 --> 00:33:46,000
Why did you fly here so quietly?

505
00:34:10,090 --> 00:34:11,960
What is this memory?

506
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,870
What’s wrong?

507
00:34:15,540 --> 00:34:18,820
Is it so weird that I wear makeup?

508
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:21,420
Have you

509
00:34:21,420 --> 00:34:23,739
met me in your past life?

510
00:34:26,489 --> 00:34:28,760
I did see you three days ago.

511
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,170
I wonder if it’s because I’ve been ignored for two days,

512
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,500
what happened three days ago seems to
have happened in the past life.

513
00:34:34,969 --> 00:34:36,199
What did you do?

514
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,440
You seemed to be busy.

515
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,489
Too busy to ignore my texts?

516
00:34:39,489 --> 00:34:41,050
What are you doing at this hour?

517
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:42,610
Why hang out here instead of working?

518
00:34:42,610 --> 00:34:44,070
I heard we got an accident victim,

519
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:45,949
so I’m on my way to the police station.

520
00:34:45,949 --> 00:34:47,190
Let’s go together.

521
00:34:47,190 --> 00:34:48,460
Why should I go with you?

522
00:34:48,460 --> 00:34:50,770
Aren’t you with me?

523
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:52,040
Come on!

524
00:34:54,420 --> 00:34:56,139
This rotten world where Han Gye-jeol wins forever.

525
00:34:56,139 --> 00:34:57,720
Ah? My legs.

526
00:34:59,010 --> 00:34:59,830
Slowly!

527
00:34:59,830 --> 00:35:02,450
Are my legs crazy? Legs!

528
00:35:07,090 --> 00:35:08,660
You I...

529
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:12,320
Well, you mean this man is the victim?

530
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:14,880
Absolutely impossible.

531
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,140
Why impossible?

532
00:35:16,140 --> 00:35:19,220
The crime scene and the statement match.

533
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,760
Because he was slightly injured,

534
00:35:20,760 --> 00:35:23,120
let’s just write a brief statement and close the case.

535
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:25,340
I got a good look at the victim’s face.

536
00:35:25,340 --> 00:35:28,470
That’s impossible. You’re mistaken.

537
00:35:28,470 --> 00:35:29,710
He?

538
00:35:39,250 --> 00:35:40,560
Does it hurt?

539
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,350
Do you feel a pain?

540
00:35:45,230 --> 00:35:47,200
No, I’m alright.

541
00:35:48,130 --> 00:35:49,390
My engine hood is totally out of shape.

542
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:51,800
How can you not even be hurt?

543
00:35:51,800 --> 00:35:53,880
Why are you lying?

544
00:35:58,410 --> 00:36:00,110
Is it because of the insurance money?

545
00:36:01,090 --> 00:36:03,150
I’m not even hurt. Why do I want the insurance money?

546
00:36:03,150 --> 00:36:04,400
Insurance money?

547
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,620
No, our player Jeong

548
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:07,970
can’t be interested in such a small amount of money.

549
00:36:08,890 --> 00:36:10,890
Who is he?

550
00:36:10,890 --> 00:36:12,640
What?

551
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,970
Don’t you want the news?

553
00:36:17,950 --> 00:36:19,700
A golf player, as excellent as Bak Bo-geom.

Well, not only did you frame our player Jeong,

564
00:36:58,410 --> 00:37:01,320
but now you want to drag a dead man into it?

565
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:02,940
Dead man?

566
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:07,690
Mr. Bak Chung-seong died two months ago.

567
00:37:07,690 --> 00:37:10,220
When the bridge was broken because of the landslide,

568
00:37:10,220 --> 00:37:12,840
he died when trying to save a trapped kid.

569
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:14,690
He died?

(Yeongpo Police Station)

571
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:25,550
Well.

572

What’s up?

573

Ah, long time no see.

It was supposed to be longer.

How are you doing?

579

I was gonna contact you.

580
00:37:40,880 --> 00:37:41,630
Why did you...

581
00:37:41,630 --> 00:37:43,650
Why did you want to contact her?

582
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,370
How dare you contact her!

583

Did he leave?

586
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:08,210
What’s your relationship? Why can’t you check yourself?

587
00:38:08,210 --> 00:38:09,270
What feelings do you still have?

588
00:38:09,270 --> 00:38:10,700
You can’t even turn around to see whether he’s gone.

589
00:38:10,700 --> 00:38:12,620
Was he once your fate?

590

What fate? I was just brushing past him.

591

Do you know how close you had to be to brush past each other?

592

If that’s the case, then it’s fate.

What?

599
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:34,930
His name is Jeong I-deun, right?

600
00:38:37,030 --> 00:38:39,630
I’ve seen him before.

601
00:38:44,030 --> 00:38:46,560
I always feel like I can remember but I can’t.

602
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,060
I can’t remember, but somehow, I feel uncomfortable.

603
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:51,050
A guy like him always brings disaster.

604
00:38:51,050 --> 00:38:52,010
Yes!

605
00:38:52,010 --> 00:38:55,000
Nothing good has happened since I knew him.

606
00:38:56,050 --> 00:38:59,580
His face is tender and white,
and he looks vulnerable and soft.

607
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:01,120
He wants to do good things.

608
00:39:01,120 --> 00:39:03,640
But that would ruin his fate.

609
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:06,040
Better not to mess with him in the first place.

610
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:06,920
Then what should I do?

611
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:08,580
I’ve already done that.

612
00:39:08,580 --> 00:39:11,200
I have to meet him two or three more times because of the accident.

613
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:12,690
Annoying!

614

If phase three clinical trial is successful,

654
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:07,270
it’ll dominate the degenerative arthritis treatment market,
(7 trillion won per year to monopolize the market for degenerative arthritis treatment)

Jang Mi-sun’s name is on it.

665
00:41:47,490 --> 00:41:50,770
It’s not like a VIP list.

666
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:56,040
I think it seems to be a medical malpractice list.

667

I don’t know if I should release this list to the press.

who is the informant?

It’s the team leader Bak Chung-seong

674

Did it ever occur to you that

00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:41,900
he was pretending to be dead and hiding somewhere?

Bak Chung-seong?

681
00:43:45,190 --> 00:43:46,410
My father

682
00:43:46,410 --> 00:43:48,050
died.

683
00:43:48,050 --> 00:43:49,580
I know.

684
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:56,760
I used to

685
00:43:56,760 --> 00:43:59,480
owe your father a lot of favors.

686
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:04,590

Have you found Bak Chung-seong? Really?

691

Well, this is the last time I will do your mother a favor.

692

However,

693
00:44:24,550 --> 00:44:27,070
you have to break up with that liar.

694

Did you hear that?

695
00:44:28,550 --> 00:44:29,780
Of course!

Call an ambulance.

699

Didn’t I say that don’t order me?

700
00:44:58,950 --> 00:45:00,270
Isn’t it a good idea to beg me?

Leg.

705

It’s a thigh fracture.

706
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:15,170
Deity, take the pillow here.

707
00:45:15,840 --> 00:45:18,160
Are you addicted to giving orders?

708

Come on! From now on

you have to serve as a splint.

711
00:45:24,110 --> 00:45:24,810
I don’t want to.

712

No.

720
00:45:39,420 --> 00:45:41,350
Deity, stretch out your foot to this side.

722

You'll always regret this day.

725
00:45:49,600 --> 00:45:51,560

I’ll take you to the underworld,

Stop.

729

What happened?

730
00:46:09,190 --> 00:46:12,660
When the pain relieved,
he relaxed, so he fainted.

731
00:46:12,660 --> 00:46:15,070
Deity, don’t move. Sit here.

732

Just hold on until the ambulance comes.

How do humans live by obeying others?

735
00:46:22,370 --> 00:46:24,170
How do you insist on obedience?

Sister! Sister!

737
00:46:31,860 --> 00:46:34,250
Are you trying to cheat with human lives?

738
00:46:34,250 --> 00:46:36,120
You’re not that bad, are you?

739
00:46:36,120 --> 00:46:37,850
That’s not true.

740
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,190
Deity, you can put your foot down now.

741
00:46:46,190 --> 00:46:47,430
How about my hands? My hands?

742
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:48,470
Wait a minute.

743
00:46:55,320 --> 00:46:56,620
Take your hands off. Get up.

744
00:47:03,790 --> 00:47:05,030
I’ll explain everything to you, sister.

745
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,670
Don’ explain to me.

746
00:47:06,670 --> 00:47:09,330
I’ve called an ambulance,
so go to the hospital and talk to the police.

747
00:47:09,330 --> 00:47:11,260
No, we can’t go to the hospital.

748
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:11,960
What?

749
00:47:11,960 --> 00:47:13,760
He hid as a righteous man
and received the compensation,

750
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:15,300
of course he can not go.

751
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:16,870
That’s not true.

752
00:47:16,870 --> 00:47:19,050
Thigh fracture is different from arm fracture.

753
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:20,380
It must be operated on.

754
00:47:20,380 --> 00:47:21,960
If the blood vessels or nerves are damaged,

755
00:47:21,960 --> 00:47:23,840
he may not be able to use his leg
for the rest of his life.

756
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:26,580
I’ve found a hospital that can
operate on people who have no relatives.

757
00:47:26,580 --> 00:47:28,930
I’ll explain to you when it’s over.

758
00:47:28,930 --> 00:47:30,600
Can you trust me and
help me just this once?

759
00:47:31,410 --> 00:47:33,410
I told you not to
have anything to do with him anymore.

760
00:47:33,410 --> 00:47:35,660
Just let it be and follow the law.

761
00:47:35,660 --> 00:47:37,020
Don’t be swayed by his words.

762
00:47:37,020 --> 00:47:38,360
He’s involved in a dangerous case

763
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:40,540
and might die,

764
00:47:40,540 --> 00:47:42,600
so he’s hiding.

765
00:47:43,380 --> 00:47:44,660
Is he going to die?

766
00:47:53,730 --> 00:47:55,590
Where is the patient?

767
00:47:58,600 --> 00:48:00,050
This guy.

768
00:48:00,790 --> 00:48:03,210
After being a human splint,
I need to be a patient, right?

769
00:48:03,860 --> 00:48:05,370
You’re so full of tricks.

773

He’s in the operating room.

00:48:35,560 --> 00:48:36,460
(Jeong I-deun We made it to the hospital. He's in the operating room.
Thank you.)
We made it to the hospital.
He’s in the operating room.

775
00:48:36,460 --> 00:48:37,820
Thank you.
(Jeong I-deun We made it to the hospital. He's in the operating room.
Thank you.)

776
00:48:43,280 --> 00:48:46,360
I accidentally got involved
with Jeong I-deun again.

777
00:48:47,770 --> 00:48:51,130
I thought he must have been justified
in doing what he did.

778
00:48:51,130 --> 00:48:56,130
Good. Because it’s just as justifiable
to repeat the same mistake.

779
00:48:56,130 --> 00:48:57,460
Are you disappointed in me?

780
00:48:57,460 --> 00:48:58,300
No.

781
00:48:58,300 --> 00:49:00,900
I’m disappointed in myself.

782
00:49:00,900 --> 00:49:03,380
I heard that the Creator told me that
there would be a disaster,

783
00:49:03,380 --> 00:49:04,720
but I didn’t listen to it.

784
00:49:04,720 --> 00:49:06,920
I might have felt that way.
I must have felt bad.

785
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,040
It’s my own fate.
What do you know?

786
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:10,340
Why bother?

787
00:49:10,340 --> 00:49:13,550
But when I watched you
jump into the fire yourself,

788
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:15,690
I can understand the Creator.

789
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:18,160
How depressed he must be.

790
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:19,310
Sorry.

791
00:49:19,310 --> 00:49:20,790
Be sorry for yourself.

792
00:49:20,790 --> 00:49:23,310
Because I am not as tolerant as that one.

793
00:49:23,310 --> 00:49:25,480
I can see you getting burned,

794
00:49:25,480 --> 00:49:29,260
but I won’t put my hand in the fire for you.

795
00:49:30,070 --> 00:49:33,720
Then who would you burn your hand for?

796
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,500
Oh, that one,

797
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:37,420
Seol Hui?

798
00:49:37,420 --> 00:49:40,210
What’s so special about that person?

799
00:49:40,210 --> 00:49:43,530
Didn’t I say that I needed her?

800
00:49:43,530 --> 00:49:47,300
Will that person become special as being needed by you?

801
00:49:47,300 --> 00:49:49,690
Then isn’t that table special,

802
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:51,090
the syringe special,

803
00:49:51,090 --> 00:49:52,390
and the bed special?

804
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:57,180
For others, have you ever been
as special as a table, a syringe, or a bed?

805
00:49:57,180 --> 00:49:58,030
Of course I have.

806
00:49:58,030 --> 00:49:59,670
I’ve saved a lot of lives.

807
00:49:59,670 --> 00:50:00,980
That’s good.

808
00:50:00,980 --> 00:50:03,970
You can go be their special person.

809
00:50:03,970 --> 00:50:05,330
Oops!

810
00:50:05,330 --> 00:50:07,110
How can you leave like that?

811
00:50:07,110 --> 00:50:09,670
The doctor will be here soon.

812
00:50:13,890 --> 00:50:15,400
Oh no!

813
00:50:21,080 --> 00:50:23,540
Let’s go together.

814
00:50:24,080 --> 00:50:26,120
Are you okay?
Are you uncomfortable?

815
00:50:26,120 --> 00:50:27,650
Get out of the way!

816
00:50:33,140 --> 00:50:33,860
What’s wrong with you?

Let go of me. I have to go.
(24-hour Emergency Room)

819

Let go of me. I have to go.

820
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:41,100
You can’t go. You’re in such a state.
Where can you go?

821
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:42,940
Please let me leave. Hurry up.

822
00:50:42,940 --> 00:50:45,110
Please let me go. Let me go.

823
00:50:45,110 --> 00:50:46,940
I told you, you can’t leave.

824
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:50,050
Go to hell! Kill him!

00:50:58,100 --> 00:50:59,030
Can you see me?

830
00:50:59,030 --> 00:51:01,870
Didn’t I say I’d kill you?

831
00:51:10,290 --> 00:51:12,550
Kill her.

832

Please don’t listen to any more words
that hurt you.

833

834
00:52:01,870 --> 00:52:04,190

00:52:37,350 --> 00:52:38,330
No way.

838
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,180
There are many people who saw it.

839
00:52:40,180 --> 00:52:44,260
I told you that Professor Do is in Yeongpo.

840
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:46,270
How could?

841
00:52:46,270 --> 00:52:48,780
Then why didn’t he contact me?

842
00:52:48,780 --> 00:52:51,130
Why don’t you listen to me?

843
00:52:51,130 --> 00:52:52,140
I told you he was crazy.

844
00:52:52,140 --> 00:52:54,450
He was out of his mind.

845
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:56,630
Aren’t you scared?

846
00:52:59,090 --> 00:53:01,730
No, I have to see him first.

847
00:53:01,730 --> 00:53:03,710
So that we can finish it, right?

848
00:53:03,710 --> 00:53:05,430
I told you to give up.

Have we met somewhere before?

00:53:21,640 --> 00:53:23,880
Maybe.

854
00:53:25,140 --> 00:53:27,190
In your dream.

855
00:53:27,190 --> 00:53:27,750
What?

00:53:27,750 --> 00:53:28,080
(Treatment Room)
What?

857
00:53:28,080 --> 00:53:29,530
Because I’m tired of hearing that.
I’ve never heard this kind of cliché.
(Treatment Room)

858
00:53:29,530 --> 00:53:31,350
Because I’m tired of hearing that.
I’ve never heard this kind of cliché.

859
00:53:31,350 --> 00:53:33,720
If you want to hook up,
at least put some effort into it.

860
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:35,830
You’re not being sincere, right?

861
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:39,510
I definitely didn’t mean that.

862
00:53:39,510 --> 00:53:40,790
I really didn’t mean it.

863
00:53:40,790 --> 00:53:42,070
I’m a detective.

864

A Korean detective.

865
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:53,460
It was found at the crime scene of Choe Gwang-mo.

866
00:53:53,460 --> 00:53:55,420
You were holding this in the CCTV.

867
00:53:55,420 --> 00:53:57,050
But why was the injection
frozen like this?

868
00:53:57,050 --> 00:53:58,930
Who would freeze an injection like this?

869
00:53:58,930 --> 00:54:00,640
Then why did it turn out like this?

870
00:54:00,640 --> 00:54:02,660
I also feel strange.

871
00:54:02,660 --> 00:54:04,820
That day, someone suddenly flashed by.

872
00:54:04,820 --> 00:54:06,880
Then suddenly I felt a chill on my body,

873
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,970
and the injection became like this.

874
00:54:08,970 --> 00:54:10,090
Who was it?

875
00:54:10,090 --> 00:54:11,190
I don’t know.

876
00:54:11,190 --> 00:54:12,860
Because the lights in the ward were broken.

877
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,200
You clearly saw it.

878
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:15,520
What?

879
00:54:26,530 --> 00:54:27,730
Who is he?

880
00:54:27,730 --> 00:54:30,590
I said I didn’t see anything.

881
00:54:30,590 --> 00:54:32,020
It’s check-in time,

882
00:54:32,020 --> 00:54:33,930
so let’s stop here.

883
00:54:34,610 --> 00:54:36,910
Is it someone you know?

884
00:54:36,910 --> 00:54:38,900
No.

885
00:54:41,830 --> 00:54:43,660
Do you have a boyfriend?

886
00:54:44,950 --> 00:54:47,040
Of course. I’m so beautiful.

887
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:49,280
Then is the guy you saw your boyfriend?

888
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:51,800
I said no.

889
00:55:00,180 --> 00:55:02,600
Are you okay, sir?

890
00:55:03,370 --> 00:55:04,500
Officer,

891
00:55:04,500 --> 00:55:05,540
you have a nosebleed!

892
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:07,010
What?

893
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:08,790
Oh, my God.

894
00:55:22,260 --> 00:55:23,690
Great.

895
00:55:23,690 --> 00:55:24,550
So comfortable.

896
00:55:24,550 --> 00:55:26,580
Oh, yeah.

897
00:55:26,580 --> 00:55:28,740
Why is he so happy?
It’s scary.

898
00:55:28,740 --> 00:55:29,780
I don’t know.

899
00:55:29,780 --> 00:55:32,120
I heard he’s got a noise canceler .

900
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:34,070
A noise canceler?

901
00:55:34,070 --> 00:55:37,230
Sure enough.
What did he buy without telling me?

902
00:55:37,230 --> 00:55:38,150
How much did he spend?

903
00:55:38,150 --> 00:55:40,050
Can I get a refund after he leaves?

904
00:55:40,050 --> 00:55:41,210
He didn’t buy anything.

905
00:55:41,210 --> 00:55:42,510
What?

906
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:44,940
He said he could only hear one person’s voice,
so he felt happy.

907
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,240
He’s always talking nonsense.

908
00:55:47,240 --> 00:55:49,010
He can’t even listen to the Creator.

909
00:55:49,010 --> 00:55:51,340
Can he listen to humans and be happy?

910
00:55:51,340 --> 00:55:53,080
Impossible.

911
00:55:53,080 --> 00:55:54,760
Something is wrong. Think about it.

912
00:55:54,760 --> 00:55:57,490
When did he start acting like this?

913
00:55:57,490 --> 00:56:03,510
Just after he talked to Han Gye-jeol
on the phone this morning...

914
00:56:03,510 --> 00:56:05,760
Is she going to close the hospital?

915
00:56:05,760 --> 00:56:07,810
Hey, I can tell right away.

916
00:56:07,810 --> 00:56:10,100
Deity, he’s in love with Han Gye-jeol.

917
00:56:10,100 --> 00:56:12,090
He’s falling in love.

918
00:56:12,090 --> 00:56:15,530
What do you know about love?

919
00:56:15,530 --> 00:56:19,680
I knew it when he opened the hospital
for her and spent money on it.

920
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:23,070
As the saying goes one will spend money on what he cares.

921
00:56:23,070 --> 00:56:24,110
Didn’t he say he could only hear one person's voice?

922
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:25,470
And he was happy because of that?

923
00:56:25,470 --> 00:56:27,410
What else can it be but love?

924
00:56:27,410 --> 00:56:28,580
Oh my God!

925
00:56:28,580 --> 00:56:30,520
What about me?

926
00:56:30,520 --> 00:56:32,730
I can stop doing this job
only if the hospital closes.

927
00:56:32,730 --> 00:56:36,160
Will Deity let his beloved go down the drain?

928
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,970
Although I feel sorry, you have to continue
to be the loyal servant of Han Gye-jeol.

929
00:56:45,160 --> 00:56:49,350
I will get rid of the biological father
who made me born in this world.

930
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:52,530
So handsome.

931
00:56:52,530 --> 00:56:54,440

(Mr. Deity)

933
00:56:57,090 --> 00:56:58,600
I have something to tell you.

934
00:56:58,600 --> 00:57:02,030
Go ahead. What do you want to say?

935
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,660
Your parents will be cured...

936
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:08,610
Thanks to that friend,
I feel comforted.

937
00:57:10,020 --> 00:57:12,410
Just tell us everything.

938
00:57:12,410 --> 00:57:13,650
And you ran away from the wedding.

939
00:57:13,650 --> 00:57:14,640
Hello.

940

You should be very fulfilled, right?

943
00:57:21,470 --> 00:57:24,810
Of course, books are spiritual food.

944
00:57:24,810 --> 00:57:27,900
You should take the food
off your face before you lie.

945
00:57:27,900 --> 00:57:30,040

00:57:30,990 --> 00:57:32,960
can you spare some time?
-What’s going on here?

948
00:57:32,960 --> 00:57:34,070
What’s going on here?

949
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:36,510
Is there one-way glass?

950
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:40,860
Say it, hurry up.

951
00:57:40,860 --> 00:57:43,380
You can only listen to what I say,

952
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,370
okay?

953
00:57:48,110 --> 00:57:48,790
Yeah.

954
00:57:48,790 --> 00:57:50,950
Why do you let me say
that every night?

955
00:57:50,950 --> 00:57:53,260
You’re obviously ignoring my words.

956
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:56,040
Because this noise canceler is from this world.

957
00:57:56,040 --> 00:57:58,230
Its expiration date is too short.

958
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,530
How can it be just one day?

01:00:00,940 --> 01:00:03,130
okay?

981
01:00:03,890 --> 01:00:06,030
Let’s come to the lighthouse sometime.

982
01:00:06,030 --> 01:00:08,480
It’s so quiet here. So nice.

983
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:11,130
There’s no one around.
It must be scary.

984
01:00:11,130 --> 01:00:14,610
I’ve seen it in the movies.
Couples who date in those places die first.

985
01:00:14,610 --> 01:00:15,890
If we meet a gangster or a murderer,

986
01:00:15,890 --> 01:00:18,540
you can’t fight them off anyway.

987
01:00:18,540 --> 01:00:22,020
That’s what I came here to do.

988
01:00:22,020 --> 01:00:25,890
Even if there is no
such huge historical mission,

989
01:00:25,890 --> 01:00:28,090
if something really happens
to the special you,

990
01:00:28,090 --> 01:00:30,470
can I just stand by and do nothing?

991
01:00:32,840 --> 01:00:35,470
Am... I special?

992
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,980
The silence of the night is so peaceful,

993
01:00:38,980 --> 01:00:41,890
the moon and the stars are so dazzling,

994
01:00:41,890 --> 01:00:43,840
I know that for the first time.

995
01:00:45,000 --> 01:00:47,070
It’s all thanks to you, the noise canceler.

996
01:00:47,070 --> 01:00:49,100
Of course you’re special.

997
01:00:49,100 --> 01:00:50,950
Cut.

998
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:54,120
I’m not Seol Hui.

999
01:00:54,120 --> 01:00:56,200
Because you’re not Seol Hui, I’m glad.

1000
01:00:56,200 --> 01:00:57,350
Why?

1001
01:00:57,350 --> 01:00:58,960
If you are Seol Hui,

1002
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:02,540
I may ruin you in the end.

1003
01:01:03,760 --> 01:01:07,390
If I really have to ruin those moments,

1004
01:01:07,390 --> 01:01:09,790
I’m really a little scared.

1005
01:01:09,790 --> 01:01:11,940
I’m such a strong person,

1006
01:01:11,940 --> 01:01:13,570
so don’t worry.

1007
01:01:13,570 --> 01:01:17,890
Anyway, even if something happens to you, the Creator won’t fix you.

1008
01:01:17,890 --> 01:01:20,210
I’m still worried that
you will be broken.

1009
01:01:20,210 --> 01:01:22,600
I will cherish you.

1010
01:01:23,610 --> 01:01:25,660
Good night.

1011
01:01:35,520 --> 01:01:39,250
What does he mean by worrying
that I will be broken?

1012
01:01:42,480 --> 01:01:45,680
Yes, I seem to have lost weight.

1013
01:01:45,680 --> 01:01:48,030
What if I break?

1014
01:01:48,030 --> 01:01:50,670
What if I break? What if I break?

1015
01:01:50,670 --> 01:01:52,940
What if I break?

1016
01:01:52,940 --> 01:01:55,680
He has to cherish me.

I’ll let you know when I don't
have to go to the clinic.
(The day when I don’t have to work)

1023

I’ll let you know when I don't
have to go to the clinic.

(I will tell you at the day when I don’t have to work.)

1025

Going for an outing.

1026

l hope it won’t rain that day.

01:02:44,280 --> 01:02:46,010
Why was Han Gye-jeol there?

1029
01:02:46,010 --> 01:02:48,480
I don’t know why yet.

1030
01:02:48,480 --> 01:02:49,090
Catch her.

1031
01:02:49,090 --> 01:02:51,360
Grab her now and ask her everything.

(The lowest price is 26,400 won. Go for the lowest price.)

1035

Send him a message.

1036

Send him a message.

1038

No clinic today.

-Hey!

1056
01:03:52,460 --> 01:03:54,130
What if he finds out?

1057
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,430
We’ll either die when he finds it out
or die from work.

1058
01:03:55,430 --> 01:03:56,530
We’ll die anyway.

1059
01:03:56,530 --> 01:03:58,280
I can’t do this anymore.

1060
01:03:58,280 --> 01:04:01,410
I don’t want to grab the catheter
or clean the spittoon.
I don’t want to do any of that.

1061
01:04:02,830 --> 01:04:04,700
Can you alienate them by doing this?

1062
01:04:04,700 --> 01:04:05,510
So

1063
01:04:05,510 --> 01:04:08,310
the most important thing is to
create a gap between them.

1064
01:04:10,750 --> 01:04:12,860
Once she’s been stood up
and her self-esteem is hurt,

1065
01:04:12,860 --> 01:04:15,660
then no matter what she says,
it will not be taken as a good word.

1066
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:17,450
Then we can encourage them to fight.

1067
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:19,130
Great.

1068
01:04:19,130 --> 01:04:20,490
You’re truly the God of Rumors. I don’t care.

1069

-Shh.

why did you come so late?

1097
01:09:12,529 --> 01:09:16,010
I’ll protect you, Seol Hui.

1098

O Hyeon.

1099
01:09:44,029 --> 01:09:46,779
So you...

1100
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:49,950
are Seol Hui.

what are you doing tonight?

Let’s spend it together.

1107
01:10:28,770 --> 01:10:30,200
So suddenly.

1108
01:10:30,200 --> 01:10:33,020
Sister, is your boyfriend not here?

1109
01:10:33,020 --> 01:10:33,900
What’s wrong with you?

1110
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:35,740
Deity, wait for me.

1111
01:10:35,740 --> 01:10:38,080
I have something to tell him.

1112
01:10:38,080 --> 01:10:38,970
Hey, Han Gye-jeol,

1113
01:10:38,970 --> 01:10:39,940
do you think I’m enough?

1114
01:10:39,940 --> 01:10:41,910
I don’t know, so...

1115
01:10:41,910 --> 01:10:43,760
-Please keep the line.
-What?

1116
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:45,790
Being a mortal is really empty.

1117
01:10:45,790 --> 01:10:47,850
-Deity.
-Only stay with that woman of the hospital.

1118
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:49,720
Do you fall in love with
Han Gye-jeol so soon?

1119
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:50,610
Even if she’s angry,
I still feel she’s beautiful.

1120
01:10:50,610 --> 01:10:52,160
Even if she screams at the top of her lungs, she’s still beautiful.

1121
01:10:52,160 --> 01:10:53,300
Oh my God!

1122
01:10:53,300 --> 01:10:55,180
I’ll get rid of Han Gye-jeol.

1123
01:10:55,180 --> 01:10:56,770
How dare you touch God’s woman?

1124
01:10:56,770 --> 01:10:59,480
I can’t leave him in the hands of mortals.
