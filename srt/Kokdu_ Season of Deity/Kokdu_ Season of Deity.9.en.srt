00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:02,320
(Episode 9)

2
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:12,870
So,

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:16,340
what’s the weakness you found of that guy?

4
00:00:19,650 --> 00:00:21,260
Look at this first.

5
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:27,060
Don’t order me, negotiate.

6
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:28,690
Even the Creator would negotiate with me.

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:30,160
But how can you be so unfair.

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:31,950
Just go. What are you doing?

9
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:34,780
But, I'm curious.

10
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:36,150
I'm curious if you'll get sick if you kiss.

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:38,020
Can’t I ask what the secretions are?

12
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:39,610
Quiet! Get out!

13
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:40,880
I told you that you said the lips.

14
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:46,020
He seems to be obedient to Han Gye-jeol.

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,080
Han Gye-jeol,

16
00:00:49,080 --> 00:00:53,540
the weakness of that spooky maniac.

17
00:00:53,540 --> 00:00:55,110
Is it just Han Gye-jeol?

18
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,160
He listens to her?

19
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:03,270
Jung Sik, Jung Sik.

20
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:05,530
Anyway, everything about that guy

21
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:08,650
is nonsense.

22
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:09,990
Just think of it as being tricked.

23
00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:14,820
How about being cautious by keeping Han Gye-jeol with you?

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,580
Thank you for your kindness.

25
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,630
But I don't want to come to Seoul.

26
00:01:23,630 --> 00:01:25,950
Didn't you hear that I’m offering you a job

27
00:01:25,950 --> 00:01:27,550
as a professor at Pilseong Hospital?

28
00:01:27,550 --> 00:01:29,120
As you come here,

29
00:01:29,120 --> 00:01:32,520
no one will ignore you in the medical field in Korea.

30
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,530
Don’t you want to come?

31
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:35,729
No, I don’t.

32
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:43,390
I have a call, excuse me.

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:56,310
Yes, what?

34
00:01:56,310 --> 00:02:00,090
Speaker, he has found the listening device.

35
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:03,810
Let's try and see if his weakness is Han Gye-jeol.

36
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:22,579
What… What are you doing?

37
00:02:23,210 --> 00:02:24,370
Let go!

38
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:39,490
Professor!

39
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:41,790
Are you crazy? Let go!

40
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,800
Chairman, are you okay?

41
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:50,010
Why are you here?

42
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:52,240
He said he had a proposal, so I came.

43
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:54,380
Proposal? What proposal? Did he threaten you?

44
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:55,900
Professor Do.

45
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:58,610
I heard that you are not normal both physically and mentally.

46
00:02:58,610 --> 00:03:01,090
But I didn’t expect it to be like this.

47
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:03,890
Dr. Han, you’re too careless.

48
00:03:03,890 --> 00:03:05,310
You should take him to a big hospital

49
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:06,850
for examination since he’s like this now.

50
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:08,420
Shut up!

51
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,930
Stop it, Professor.

52
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:12,060
Go out. Let’s go out.

53
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,730
You leave first. I have something to talk to him.

54
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,360
Maybe later when you’ve calmed down.

55
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,270
Dr. Han,

56
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:21,160
I had a great shock today.

57
00:03:21,160 --> 00:03:23,700
I don’t want to see Professor Do again for a while.

58
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:30,730
Don’t let him come. Please help me persuade him.

59
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:35,829
That guy, does... Does he knows something?

60
00:03:46,390 --> 00:03:47,680
Are you crazy?

61
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,550
Do you think I’ll be with you for thousands of years to protect you?

62
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:51,590
I must have said that before

63
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,220
my time in the world is very short.

64
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,350
I want to solve all the problems

65
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:55,440
in this period before I leave.

66
00:03:55,440 --> 00:03:57,030
So I can rest assured, right?

67
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,170
Solve?

68
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:01,880
Is this the solution you want?

69
00:04:01,880 --> 00:04:05,850
Kill Kim Pil-soo and disappear again?

70
00:04:05,850 --> 00:04:09,210
Have you ever thought about what will happen to the one left by you?

71
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,200
I let you come to this point, and have stood by and watched.

72
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:15,640
How regretful I will be in the future?

73
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:17,899
Haven’t you thought about it?

74
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:23,980
I know you don’t have much time.

75
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,210
But you can’t be reckless because it’s short.

76
00:04:28,780 --> 00:04:30,860
Just like snow in the summer,

77
00:04:30,860 --> 00:04:32,790
a mirage in the desert,

78
00:04:32,790 --> 00:04:36,340
they’re more precious because of their short life.

79
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:37,860
During that short period,

80
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,240
can’t you try to be a better person?

81
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,010
And what am I doing this for?

82
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:50,070
For me.

83
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:52,860
What?

84
00:04:53,909 --> 00:04:56,290
For me, you need to get counseling.

85
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:58,060
Please try to make an effort

86
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:00,370
to receive treatment.

87
00:05:01,510 --> 00:05:04,280
Then I will try for you too.

88
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:11,440
Please don’t misunderstand. Listen to me, Han Gye-jeol.

89
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:13,300
You’re just a human being.

90
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,870
How will you try for me?

91
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:23,230
I’ll try not to run away, and be more honest.

92
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:27,340
Although the summer is short,

93
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:30,620
just like the cicadas who treat the summer day as their whole life,

94
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:34,200
we should treat this moment as our whole life.

95
00:05:36,230 --> 00:05:37,570
You...

96
00:05:37,570 --> 00:05:40,740
You once asked me how I think of you.

97
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:44,550
I’m sorry I’m late in answering.

98
00:05:45,670 --> 00:05:47,710
I...

99
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:51,590
Love Dei…

100
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:07,590
There is a time for everything.

101
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,780
Even if I don’t know when the separation will come,

102
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,800
and all this will disappear,

103
00:06:14,620 --> 00:06:16,520
at this moment,

104
00:06:18,410 --> 00:06:19,990
we should fall in love.

105
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,520
Until the woman says she loves you even being like this,

106
00:07:01,780 --> 00:07:04,690
your cursed life will end

107
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:07,140
and you will be at peace forever.

108
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,460
Before this woman finds peace,

109
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:16,160
I will never be at peace.

110
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:14,230
You said you want to be a cicada.

111
00:08:16,020 --> 00:08:20,900
Do you know the story behind the cicada and you're saying that?

112
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:25,000
Didn't you say you don't like sad endings?

113
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:27,600
Then don't try to be a cicada.

114
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,250
Then don't wake me up and let me have other dreams.

115
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,720
What? When did you wake up?

116
00:08:37,470 --> 00:08:40,309
When you tickled me here.

117
00:08:41,320 --> 00:08:42,870
It almost tickled me to death.

118
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:44,670
You should let people know you're awake.

119
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:46,790
How do I want people to know I'm awake when I look like this?

120
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:50,530
Yeah, you don't like shampoo.

121
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,990
Ah, you’re really annoying.

122
00:08:57,350 --> 00:09:00,610
By the way, why am I here?

123
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,690
Because it's your house, that's why you're here.

124
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,840
You can’t be in my house, can you?

125
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,850
What did we do at night?

126
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:11,450
We slept together.

127
00:09:12,530 --> 00:09:13,440
I see.

128
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:17,100
I said that because I didn't want you to misunderstand.

129
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:20,060
You're the only one who slept.

130
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,130
Only me?

131
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:26,260
You were shouting about becoming a cicada, and suddenly fainted, which was a shock.

132
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:28,910
Then I realized that you were asleep, and I was the only one who was scared and screamed.

133
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:37,410
Did I fall asleep while shouting?

134
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,540
Is that all?

135
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:44,720
That’s it, what else there should be?

136
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:47,750
Why doesn't he tell me about the kiss?

137
00:09:47,750 --> 00:09:50,470
It's a memory that she wouldn't remember anyway.

138
00:09:51,310 --> 00:09:54,450
Ah, you snored.

139
00:09:54,450 --> 00:09:55,540
What?

140
00:09:55,540 --> 00:09:58,890
It’s said that one snores at menopause because of hormonal imbalance.

141
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:02,640
Look at you, your face is red. Go to the hospital.

142
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,260
You should go, go.

143
00:10:07,260 --> 00:10:08,050
To where?

144
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:10,650
Get out of here!

145
00:10:10,650 --> 00:10:12,810
Don't order me.

146
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:15,920
Wait, wait, wait.

147
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,650
Wait a minute, wait a minute. Shhhhhh.

148
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,000
As I’m working, I don't have time to go home sometimes.

149
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,620
It's so hard for me to come home and you tell me to get out. Is that the right thing to say?

150
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:26,320
Where does he come from?

151
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,870
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

152
00:10:36,430 --> 00:10:38,120
It's my brother.

153
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:39,070
It's my brother.

154
00:10:39,070 --> 00:10:40,140
You're really...

155
00:10:41,630 --> 00:10:45,610
I’m changing my clothes, just go away.

156
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:48,120
You're not the kind of sister who's going to be a stranger to me.

157
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:50,740
We've seen everything of each other, and you locked the door?

158
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,310
Oh my god.

159
00:10:52,310 --> 00:10:55,370
There's someone in there, isn't there, man?

160
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,620
I have a good intuition. Open the door when I nicely tell you to.

161
00:10:57,620 --> 00:11:00,030
Why are you hiding me? Are you ashamed of me?

162
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:00,860
Oh my god.

163
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:06,110
-I'll pry the door open and get in. -Ah, what the hell.

164
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,180
Bed.

165
00:11:08,180 --> 00:11:09,600
One, two…

166
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,710
Don't you dare open your mouth.

167
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:13,200
Three.

168
00:11:14,960 --> 00:11:16,240
Hey, you!

169
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,920
Hey, are you drunk?

170
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:22,100
If you've had a good drink, you should sleep as a good boy.

171
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,070
Brother-in-law.

172
00:11:26,070 --> 00:11:27,080
What?

173
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,060
It's my laundry.

174
00:11:34,060 --> 00:11:35,330
Brother-in-law?

175
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:40,310
Is he shelled? What's important

176
00:11:40,310 --> 00:11:42,510
to pile up the changed clothes? How dirty.

177
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:43,940
What?

178
00:11:46,910 --> 00:11:47,970
What's going on?

179
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,990
Hey, look at this.

180
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,580
What's going on?

181
00:11:55,580 --> 00:11:56,470
Where?

182
00:11:56,470 --> 00:12:00,600
Turning my eyes to the bed and letting him escape through the window.

183
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:02,360
What?

184
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:06,870
How professional! You're not first-time offenders, are you?

185
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,710
You!

186
00:12:08,710 --> 00:12:10,520
Who are you pretending to be a detective with?

187
00:12:10,520 --> 00:12:12,270
You don’t go out?

188
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,530
One, two, three, get out.

189
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:28,220
How did he get out?

190
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,420
When are we meeting?

191
00:12:38,340 --> 00:12:39,750
Meet whom?

192
00:12:39,750 --> 00:12:41,200
That man just now.

193
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,300
It wasn't a man.

194
00:12:43,300 --> 00:12:45,670
And even if it was a man, what's the matter?

195
00:12:45,670 --> 00:12:46,830
He is my man, why do you want to meet him?

196
00:12:46,830 --> 00:12:47,940
Why?

197
00:12:47,940 --> 00:12:50,490
Of course a man should be graded by a man.

198
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:54,420
Because you have a great record.

199
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,450
The guy who ran away after borrowing the tuition fee.

200
00:12:56,450 --> 00:12:59,050
And the guy who foul-mouthed you after cheating.

201
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,680
Sister, you have to pass on the bloodline of our Han family of Goksan, so you cannot just marry someone.

202
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,520
Stupid, even if I have a baby, it won't be surnamed Han.

203
00:13:06,520 --> 00:13:10,220
Oh, so you've planned to have a baby?

204
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,800
I shouldn't have talked to you.

205
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:12,970
Don't worry.

206
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:15,370
I'm not a creepy, strict person either.

207
00:13:15,370 --> 00:13:18,230
Men are all the same. They're all no better.

208
00:13:18,230 --> 00:13:19,590
As long as it's not Do Jin-woo.

209
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:22,350
What? Do Jin-woo?

210
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:24,190
What?

211
00:13:24,190 --> 00:13:27,430
Why are you so scared when it comes to Do Jin-woo?

212
00:13:27,430 --> 00:13:28,940
What,

213
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,120
of course I will be scared.

214
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:33,340
How can I not be scared when I hear that name?

215
00:13:34,590 --> 00:13:39,910
You're not dating that guy, are you?

216
00:13:39,910 --> 00:13:40,830
No, right?

217
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:43,920
Who could I date?

218
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:45,740
That’s it.

219
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:49,520
You've been cheated on so badly. You haven't forgotten all about it, have you?

220
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,160
You'd have to be crazy to go out with that guy again.

221
00:13:55,140 --> 00:13:59,010
But what's wrong with Do Jin-woo? Why not?

222
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:05,330
He's a doctor, and he's a good-looking guy, no flaws.

223
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:08,250
His character is flawed. Character!

224
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:11,200
He's definitely not good. He's dangerous.

225
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:12,670
Dangerous? What's dangerous?

226
00:14:12,670 --> 00:14:14,470
It’s that…

227
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:16,440
I can't talk about the investigation.

228
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:22,370
Did you forget that the guy ran away after using you?

229
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:25,510
Those who run away after cheating are worse than divers.

230
00:14:25,510 --> 00:14:27,700
Diving is short-lived, but running away after cheating is a habit.

231
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,240
When he does everything he has to do, he pretends not to know and runs away.

232
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,170
He has tortured people to the point of skin and bones. Isn't that dangerous?

233
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,560
Seeing him kissing and pretending not to know, that is really a habit huh.

234
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,150
He is dangerous enough.

235
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:40,470
Of course he is dangerous.

236
00:14:40,470 --> 00:14:43,420
That kind of guy, even if I die, I can't let him date you.

237
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:54,920
(Detective Kim)

238
00:15:08,550 --> 00:15:12,450
What's the use of reading the newspaper? You're so arrogant.

239
00:15:20,310 --> 00:15:23,460
How dare you mess with god?

240
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,610
You're swayed by the words of a lowly woman.

241
00:15:26,610 --> 00:15:29,150
How can you call yourself a god?

242
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:06,070
I am not the kind of god who is so tolerant of lowly people.

243
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:13,900
That's the end of my tolerance.

244
00:16:13,900 --> 00:16:16,630
If you dare to touch that woman,

245
00:16:16,630 --> 00:16:20,490
you will die in the most painful way in this world,

246
00:16:20,490 --> 00:16:24,650
in the pain of being slashed, gouged and breaking bones,

247
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:28,060
you will think that death is salvation, and then you will slowly die.

248
00:16:28,060 --> 00:16:30,670
The only card I hold in my hand is Han Gye-jeol.

249
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:33,860
Am I crazy? How could I touch that woman?

250
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,710
I would never touch her.

251
00:16:35,710 --> 00:16:39,670
So please, just pretend that we don't know each other.

252
00:16:39,670 --> 00:16:42,010
Let's go our separate ways.

253
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,610
Stupid.

254
00:16:46,610 --> 00:16:49,860
You still think you're in a position to make demands?

255
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:53,300
Then why don't you tell me what you want me to do by doing this?

256
00:16:53,300 --> 00:16:55,030
You seem to have a deep misunderstanding.

257
00:16:55,030 --> 00:17:00,180
God is the one who gives gifts to humans.

258
00:17:00,180 --> 00:17:03,910
I hope you'll be happy with the gift I've prepared for you.

259
00:17:03,910 --> 00:17:05,250
What do you mean by that?

260
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:24,140
(Secretary Nam)

261
00:17:25,960 --> 00:17:26,829
Well...

262
00:17:26,829 --> 00:17:29,060
Speaker, something terrible has happened.

263
00:17:29,910 --> 00:17:31,290
Speaker Kim Pil-soo,

264
00:17:31,290 --> 00:17:32,770
is it true that

265
00:17:32,770 --> 00:17:34,420
Pilseong Hospital falsified the medical records?

266
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:36,500
Why would you falsify the medical records of ordinary people?

267
00:17:36,500 --> 00:17:38,460
Do you know about the list?

268
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:41,080
Speaker Kim Pil-soo, please say something.

269
00:17:45,530 --> 00:17:48,070
In the early hours of this morning,

270
00:17:48,070 --> 00:17:50,350
a worker of Pilseong Medical Center was found in the area of Gwaebangsan in Yeongpo.

271
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,950
He ended his life in a desperate manner.

272
00:17:51,950 --> 00:17:54,150
According to the suicide note found at the scene,

273
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,280
the medical examination records were falsified by Pilseong Hospital in an organized manner.

274
00:17:58,280 --> 00:18:00,660
It is expected to cause a big storm.

275
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:02,530
I don't even know what the reason is.

276
00:18:02,530 --> 00:18:05,770
They falsified the medical records of certain people.

277
00:18:05,770 --> 00:18:07,710
Because of the condemnation of conscience,

278
00:18:07,710 --> 00:18:10,850
I provided the list to the media.

279
00:18:10,850 --> 00:18:12,830
But they were also on the side of Pilseong.

280
00:18:12,830 --> 00:18:15,000
Even my personal safety was threatened,

281
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,880
so I had to go into hiding.

282
00:18:16,880 --> 00:18:19,010
But I have no way to escape,

283
00:18:19,010 --> 00:18:21,720
so I risked my life to denounce

284
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,520
His child is still so young.

285
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,250
He should find a way to survive.

286
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,570
Is this true?

287
00:18:28,570 --> 00:18:31,100
That should be a big blow to Pilseong Hospital.

288
00:18:31,100 --> 00:18:33,530
The reporters are already investigating.

289
00:18:33,530 --> 00:18:36,520
I think they'll find out if it's true.

290
00:18:36,520 --> 00:18:39,480
But how did those reporters know about it?

291
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,550
Whenever a case like this happens,

292
00:18:41,550 --> 00:18:43,270
(Annotation: "MBS" and "time of publication" are homophones.)
I see that the upper level will first restrict MBS.

293
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:47,250
I think it's to restrict the time of publication. What MBS?
(Annotation: "MBS" and "time of publication" are homophones.)

294
00:18:47,250 --> 00:18:49,830
What can we do to restrict TV stations?
(Annotation: "MBS" and "time of publication" are homophones.)

295
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:53,320
Detective Kim is really an elite.

296
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:55,290
How the hell do they know?

297
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,070
They are the YouTubers who experience horror.

298
00:19:01,070 --> 00:19:03,280
They were the first to find out.

299
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:04,400
Please step back a little more.

300
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:08,840
So before they could do anything to stop it, the word had spread.

301
00:19:21,750 --> 00:19:23,040
YouTubers.

302
00:19:23,040 --> 00:19:26,360
The suicide note was faked to perfection.

303
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:28,540
When did you learn this skill?

304
00:19:28,730 --> 00:19:33,240
Ok Shin was urging me to forge Lord Deity's signature.

305
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:35,870
After centuries of doing that kind of work, it became more and more perfect.

306
00:19:35,870 --> 00:19:37,200
Why did you forge my signature?

307
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:41,030
Of course, to recover all the money that Lord Deity donated.

308
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:44,680
Do you guys really want to die?

309
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:45,760
I've been so kind to you.

310
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,170
If I told them everything...

311
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,070
If I told them everything...

312
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:11,590
Brother, you wouldn't be in this situation now, would you?

313
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:18,210
I'm sorry, brother.

314
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:24,470
Rest in peace, brother Chung-seong.

315
00:20:27,910 --> 00:20:29,540
I'm sorry, brother.

316
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,190
It's all my fault.

317
00:20:34,890 --> 00:20:38,740
I should have done better. I'm sorry.

318
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:58,610
Rest in peace.

319
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:32,260
Delivery.

320
00:21:33,910 --> 00:21:36,740
Are you out of your mind?

321
00:21:38,090 --> 00:21:40,080
I know the heart of evil very well.

322
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:42,640
If I were him, I would never let go of my weakness.

323
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,130
That's why that guy will also try to fight Han Gye-jeol by all means

324
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:47,070
to lead me to destruction.

325
00:21:47,070 --> 00:21:48,860
I need to be prepared perfectly.

326
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,110
So do you mean the perfect preparation

327
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,640
is living together? Living together?

328
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:59,610
You just don't know how many loopholes there are in the daily life of Han Gye-jeol.

329
00:21:59,970 --> 00:22:02,450
She's the kind of person who needs to be guarded all the time.

330
00:22:02,450 --> 00:22:04,740
I need to remind her whenever I can so she doesn't get into trouble.

331
00:22:05,140 --> 00:22:09,050
If I want to be around her 24 hours a day, we have to live together.

332
00:22:10,670 --> 00:22:12,840
Oh, my head.

333
00:22:12,840 --> 00:22:15,180
How come it's so small? It looks like it’s for single person.

334
00:22:15,180 --> 00:22:17,360
Take it back.

335
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:18,760
Next one.

336
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:21,270
This is really...

337
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:25,110
Are you going to live together with Han Gye-jeol's consent?

338
00:22:25,110 --> 00:22:29,570
Did you get Han Gye-jeol's approval before you bought the bridal furniture?

339
00:22:29,570 --> 00:22:31,830
What bridal furniture?

340
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:35,090
It’s just having one more person living here, so I added some things.

341
00:22:35,090 --> 00:22:38,150
Although I look like a modern man,

342
00:22:38,150 --> 00:22:40,440
I'm also an ancient man who can't help it.

343
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,820
I need a matchmaker to exchange the list of fate and choose a date to avoid bad luck.

344
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:48,380
If I don't follow these steps and rituals, it can't be considered a marriage.

345
00:22:48,380 --> 00:22:50,900
If it's not a marriage, can Han Gye-jeol live with you?

346
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:53,280
No matter how much you’ve explained to her how dark Kim Pil-soo was inside,

347
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:55,800
but in Han Seol's eyes, maybe you look a little darker inside.

348
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:01,370
She's already blinded by me.

349
00:23:01,370 --> 00:23:02,880
She's already blinded.

350
00:23:02,880 --> 00:23:06,070
That's why she will pretend not to see the darkness inside of me.

351
00:23:06,070 --> 00:23:08,150
What do you see that makes you so confident?

352
00:23:08,150 --> 00:23:12,330
I didn't see it, I heard it. The confession of love.

353
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:18,320
As the saying goes, you have to hear the last word in Korean.

354
00:23:18,320 --> 00:23:19,480
I love Deit...

355
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:22,370
What else could it be as it goes here, what else could I hear if I've heard it all?

356
00:23:22,370 --> 00:23:27,270
I want to hunt Deity. I want to reject Deity.

357
00:23:27,270 --> 00:23:31,940
I'm going to cheat Deity. I think Deity is a pervert.
(Memes that sound like “love”.)

358
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,770
Today, Ok Shin just dies.

359
00:23:33,770 --> 00:23:35,120
Come here, come here!

360
00:23:35,120 --> 00:23:37,960
Come here! Stop! You bastard!

361
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:56,450
You want to live together? Are you out of your mind?

362
00:23:56,450 --> 00:23:58,620
Do you think it's okay?

363
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:00,930
My heart is pounding for fear of rejection.

364
00:24:00,930 --> 00:24:02,530
And my soul is running back and forth.

365
00:24:08,490 --> 00:24:11,190
So why are you saying such crazy things?

366
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:17,030
I'm afraid you'll be in danger.

367
00:24:17,030 --> 00:24:19,240
Dangerous? Me?

368
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:20,270
Why?

369
00:24:20,270 --> 00:24:23,150
Kim Pil-soo won’t spare anyone who has access to his secrets.

370
00:24:23,150 --> 00:24:25,500
He’s very dangerous.

371
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,530
So what should I do?

372
00:24:26,530 --> 00:24:29,020
I have to be by your side 24 hours a day to protect you, that’s the only way.

373
00:24:30,350 --> 00:24:33,990
Is Kim Pil-soo more dangerous than you?

374
00:24:33,990 --> 00:24:35,380
Me? What’s wrong with me?

375
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:38,890
I thought the only murderer who could drive a woman to her death was a diver.

376
00:24:38,890 --> 00:24:42,080
Then I found out that there are also runaway men.

377
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,390
Be clear.

378
00:24:43,390 --> 00:24:46,820
Am I a murderer, diver or a runaway man?

379
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:48,510
Of course you’re a runaway man!

380
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,030
Kiss runaway man

381
00:24:50,030 --> 00:24:51,960
Kiss... What?

382
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:56,630
I really don't want to mention it because it's too humiliating.

383
00:24:58,350 --> 00:25:01,530
How can you not take it seriously every time you kiss?

384
00:25:01,530 --> 00:25:04,710
I’ve never seen a kiss runaway man before.

385
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:08,650
Are you that surprised?

386
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:14,050
Looks like other women have just let it slide, right?

387
00:25:14,050 --> 00:25:17,580
Can you remember the kiss? Why? How do you remember it?

388
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,840
Do you think I’m stupid?

389
00:25:18,840 --> 00:25:20,800
Of course I remember. How could I not remember?

390
00:25:22,470 --> 00:25:28,040
Fine, I initiated to kiss you for the first time. So I pretended not to know that.

391
00:25:28,040 --> 00:25:30,970
But what about yesterday? You kissed me first yesterday.

392
00:25:30,970 --> 00:25:34,430
You couldn't even deal with it, then why did you kiss me?

393
00:25:34,430 --> 00:25:37,640
Why did you kiss me? Tell me the truth!

394
00:25:37,640 --> 00:25:39,760
The truth? No, Han Gye-jeol.

395
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:43,070
Integrity between men and women is a shortcut to tragedy.

396
00:25:43,070 --> 00:25:45,830
I... Tell me the truth!

397
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:47,910
Don't order me.

398
00:25:50,370 --> 00:25:55,230
Your mouth... I wanted to gag you anyway.

399
00:25:55,230 --> 00:26:00,350
I... Gag me? Why?

400
00:26:02,090 --> 00:26:04,370
Tell me. Tell me the truth.

401
00:26:06,570 --> 00:26:08,750
Because I'm afraid you'll say you love me.

402
00:26:15,170 --> 00:26:17,910
So you mean that

403
00:26:17,910 --> 00:26:20,820
you don't want to hear I love you,

404
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:23,510
but you want to kiss and live together with me, right?

405
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,700
Let the body and the heart each play their own game?

406
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:29,620
So that's...

407
00:26:29,620 --> 00:26:30,610
Playing?

408
00:26:30,610 --> 00:26:32,020
How can it be playing? It's definitely not.

409
00:26:32,020 --> 00:26:34,500
Think about it. I'm beautiful, fit, wealthy, and perfect.

410
00:26:34,500 --> 00:26:37,240
I don't have to play tricks on you...

411
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:50,850
I should have sewn my mouth shut, idiot.

412
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:55,990
Being blunt is a big problem.

413
00:26:57,860 --> 00:26:59,080
Han Gye-jeol.

414
00:26:59,080 --> 00:27:01,150
This is my hospital, so get out.

415
00:27:01,150 --> 00:27:03,690
Get out! Get out!

416
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:06,480
Get out. Get out.

417
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:28,760
Playing? Who did you talk to play?

418
00:27:28,760 --> 00:27:30,930
How frivolous do you think I am?

419
00:27:30,930 --> 00:27:32,860
So casually talking about living together.

420
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,820
Women should not be easily moved.

421
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,630
Twice have sung it many times.

422
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,560
I've grown up for nothing.

423
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:01,860
Whenever she was sad and alone,

424
00:28:01,860 --> 00:28:05,010
when she felt embarrassed and frustrated,

425
00:28:05,010 --> 00:28:06,820
my mom would cook,

426
00:28:08,830 --> 00:28:12,730
not for others, but for herself.

427
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:18,760
My mother said that only when I learn to be good to myself

428
00:28:18,760 --> 00:28:22,200
will others be good to me.

429
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:32,100
How good can I be to myself to make myself precious?

430
00:28:33,470 --> 00:28:35,180
I still don't understand.

431
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,550
I'm sorry.

432
00:28:44,860 --> 00:28:49,620
(I'm sorry, but I didn't mean it.)

433
00:28:49,620 --> 00:28:53,400
That's not what I really meant.
(I'm sorry, but I didn't mean it.)

434
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:54,260
(I'm sorry, but I didn't mean it.)

435
00:28:59,080 --> 00:28:59,580
There is a secret between us.

436
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:02,720
(There’re secrets between us.)
There is a secret between us.

437
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:03,210
(There’re secrets between us.)

438
00:29:07,110 --> 00:29:10,250
But you want to kiss and live together with me, right?

439
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:12,090
Let the body and the heart each play their own game?

440
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:15,830
So that's...

441
00:29:15,830 --> 00:29:17,050
Playing?

442
00:29:19,140 --> 00:29:22,770
How in the world can play so hard and so painful?

443
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:30,740
The harder it is, the more positive I should be.

444
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,240
(Did you sleep?)

445
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,250
Are you asleep?
(Did you sleep?)

446
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:36,390
(Did you sleep?)

447
00:29:36,390 --> 00:29:38,110
She read it.
(Did you sleep?)

448
00:29:38,530 --> 00:29:39,340
(What are you doing?)

449
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,530
What are you doing?
(What are you doing?)

450
00:29:40,530 --> 00:29:42,750
(What are you doing?)

451
00:29:45,660 --> 00:29:46,540
She clearly read it.

452
00:29:47,980 --> 00:29:49,590
Can I call you?

453
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,530
(Can I call you?)

454
00:29:54,950 --> 00:29:58,110
I think it means... I can call her.

455
00:30:03,710 --> 00:30:04,870
What are you doing?

456
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:16,380
Are you worried about how to text a woman?

457
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,530
How do you know?

458
00:30:20,530 --> 00:30:22,180
What else could it be?

459
00:30:22,180 --> 00:30:24,860
It's written on your face.

460
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:33,600
I've led the way for the dead and committed the sin of God,

461
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,680
and I thought there was nothing difficult in the world except these.

462
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:40,180
I feel more and more that there is no easy thing in the world.

463
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:43,400
The more precious things are, the more difficult they are to obtain.

464
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:46,510
Isn't it unfair that they are precious and easy?

465
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,250
How about it?

466
00:30:49,250 --> 00:30:54,010
Let me help you make things easier?

467
00:30:54,010 --> 00:30:54,960
Really?

468
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:57,270
Just do as I say.

469
00:30:57,270 --> 00:30:58,930
When texting a woman,

470
00:30:58,930 --> 00:31:01,330
just don't say three kinds of words.

471
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,910
Oh, three kinds of words.

472
00:31:02,910 --> 00:31:06,610
The first one, are you asleep?

473
00:31:06,610 --> 00:31:08,080
Oh, my God. Are you asleep?

474
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,790
What does it mean to text so late and ask, are you asleep?

475
00:31:10,790 --> 00:31:13,130
It's something that women really hate.

476
00:31:13,130 --> 00:31:14,580
Okay.

477
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:17,420
Second, what are you doing?

478
00:31:17,420 --> 00:31:20,380
What are you doing? So what if you know what I'm doing?

479
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,270
If I'm shitting, do you want to come over and help me wipe my ass?

480
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:24,720
What are you doing?

481
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,300
A bad feeling.

482
00:31:27,300 --> 00:31:31,560
Third, can I call you?

483
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,510
Can I call you?

484
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:34,740
So insensitive.

485
00:31:34,740 --> 00:31:36,970
Don't you know I don't want to answer your phone right now?

486
00:31:36,970 --> 00:31:38,530
So insensitive. Go to hell.

487
00:31:38,530 --> 00:31:40,560
Go to hell. Death penalty level.

488
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:42,340
Just don't do these three things.

489
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,320
You're happy.

490
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:51,340
Are you happy to sentence your master to death legally?

491
00:31:53,150 --> 00:31:54,990
Why are you so angry?

492
00:31:54,990 --> 00:31:56,740
Did you...

493
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:07,510
Oh, my God, you’ve sent all three.

494
00:32:07,510 --> 00:32:09,940
I won't send anything, okay?

495
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:13,320
So disgusting!

496
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:14,240
So noisy!

497
00:32:23,980 --> 00:32:28,300
You said to call, you have to call.

498
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,760
Whether it's an apology or an excuse.

499
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:30,610
You have to do something.

500
00:32:30,610 --> 00:32:33,320
How can a man not do anything?

501
00:32:33,320 --> 00:32:35,590
Does he think he did the right thing?

502
00:32:38,950 --> 00:32:39,930
Whatever.

503
00:33:04,660 --> 00:33:06,560
Is this man

504
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:09,100
trying to play cat and mouse with me?

505
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,970
He's really a master, a master.

506
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:20,660
I've really been caught by a love master.

507
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,700
A master?

508
00:33:26,660 --> 00:33:28,590
Are you going to enter the cooking contest?

509
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,800
Like the Korean food contest?

510
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:33,870
Wow!

511
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:37,580
You're really a master!

512
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:39,070
This is a bribe.

513
00:33:39,070 --> 00:33:41,750
Since you take it, you have to pay for it.

514
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,970
What bribe?

515
00:33:42,970 --> 00:33:46,530
Take this and eat it with your seniors.

516
00:33:46,530 --> 00:33:48,700
But keep an eye on Bak Chung-seong case for me.

517
00:33:48,700 --> 00:33:50,720
What does he have to do with you?

518
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,050
Pilseong Hospital?

519
00:33:54,050 --> 00:33:55,050
Is he someone you know?

520
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:58,420
I don't know him.

521
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,760
I saw the news and felt sorry for him.

522
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:02,860
So I want you to help take care of his case.

523
00:34:02,860 --> 00:34:04,330
Fighting!

524
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:06,990
I also want to do a good job.

525
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,380
But they don't take me.

526
00:34:08,380 --> 00:34:09,889
Why?

527
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,350
Are you being isolated?

528
00:34:12,520 --> 00:34:14,190
Have they found the fact that

529
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,270
your IQ is in double digits?

530
00:34:15,270 --> 00:34:16,400
Hey!

531
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,510
We police don't have prejudice against that.

532
00:34:18,510 --> 00:34:19,380
You’re really proud of it.

533
00:34:20,389 --> 00:34:24,540
They always tell me to stay out of this case and let me go to Seoul.

534
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:27,389
It seems that they will put me in charge of a very big case.

535
00:34:27,389 --> 00:34:28,280
I have an intuition.

536
00:34:28,280 --> 00:34:30,730
You really have an intuition, my brother!

537
00:34:30,730 --> 00:34:33,370
You're going to get kicked out now.

538
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:34,550
What are you talking about?

539
00:34:37,610 --> 00:34:39,520
Take this to eat with your seniors.

540
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:43,860
5:00, in the hospital lobby. Don't be late.

541
00:34:57,630 --> 00:34:59,610
You've lasted so long,

542
00:34:59,610 --> 00:35:01,220
finally they found it out.

543
00:35:02,780 --> 00:35:04,720
I've been holding out for a long time.

544
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:06,910
Korea is a small country.

545
00:35:06,910 --> 00:35:10,370
It would be better if you followed Professor Do to America.

546
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,320
So what?

547
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:16,710
I do not have the good fortune to find a good man.

548
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:19,160
Don’t say that.

549
00:35:20,360 --> 00:35:22,260
Didn't you say that the cute police officer would help you?

550
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:23,250
Cute?

551
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:24,570
Who?

552
00:35:24,570 --> 00:35:26,420
Do you think Yu A-in is cute?

553
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:28,420
Yes.

554
00:35:28,420 --> 00:35:30,900
Aren't his eyes as cute as a dog's goofy eyes?

555
00:35:30,900 --> 00:35:32,370
When he smiles,

556
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:34,290
his eyes turn into crescent moon eyes, just like this.

557
00:35:34,290 --> 00:35:35,770
Moon puppies

558
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:37,300
are totally my cup of tea.

559
00:35:37,300 --> 00:35:40,250
Hey, make a date for us sometime,

560
00:35:40,250 --> 00:35:41,080
okay?

561
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:41,820
Okay.

562
00:35:43,670 --> 00:35:46,860
Then I need to get my hair done.

563
00:35:46,860 --> 00:35:47,960
Make it look good.

564
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,090
Okay.

565
00:35:53,550 --> 00:35:55,290
Bad taste in man.

566
00:35:56,750 --> 00:35:58,990
Moon puppy, nonsense.

567
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:05,540
Whatever.

568
00:36:07,870 --> 00:36:09,440
He's kind of like that.

569
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:13,470
Am I thinking about that man now?

570
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:16,120
I'm crazy. I'm really crazy.

571
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:30,560
Yes, please come in.

572
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:40,180
Bad woman!

573
00:36:40,180 --> 00:36:42,520
If the appointment is made, you should be punctual.

574
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:43,640
Didn't I say no?

575
00:36:43,640 --> 00:36:45,140
Why do you keep coming to me?

576
00:36:45,140 --> 00:36:46,380
I've already said that.

577
00:36:46,380 --> 00:36:48,060
You’ve understood my meaning, right?

578
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,050
I don't want that!

579
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,580
What the hell!

580
00:36:50,580 --> 00:36:51,940
This guy...

581
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,650
You...

582
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:02,490
Stalker, are you crazy?

583
00:37:02,490 --> 00:37:04,120
What are you doing?

584
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,170
Professor!

585
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:06,520
Professor, are you okay?

586
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:07,440
Professor?

587
00:37:11,060 --> 00:37:11,790
What's going on?

588
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,140
My neck.

589
00:37:23,030 --> 00:37:26,090
Did the police beat citizens indiscriminately?

590
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:28,700
I’ll report him for malfeasance violence,

591
00:37:28,700 --> 00:37:30,760
and let him try the taste of jail.

592
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:33,260
Don’t say malfeasance violence, Professor.

593
00:37:33,260 --> 00:37:35,750
It's just an accident, accident.

594
00:37:35,750 --> 00:37:38,260
He mistook you for a stalker, didn't he?

595
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,000
Stalker?

596
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,670
What do I look like a stalker?

597
00:37:41,690 --> 00:37:42,990
I, Bae Chang-su,

598
00:37:42,990 --> 00:37:45,340
am a professor at Seoul Pilseong Hospital.

599
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:47,930
I'm a person with only mainstream education.

600
00:37:47,930 --> 00:37:50,840
I'm really sorry.

601
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,580
We will educate Officer Han properly.

602
00:37:53,580 --> 00:37:55,670
Please let him go this time.

603
00:37:56,930 --> 00:37:58,170
Hey, Officer Han!

604
00:37:58,170 --> 00:37:59,050
What are you doing?

605
00:37:59,050 --> 00:38:00,080
Apologize now!

606
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:02,380
I'm sorry.

607
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:03,720
No, no, no, no.

608
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:06,760
I don't have anything to say to you.

609
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:07,990
What?

610
00:38:07,990 --> 00:38:09,430
Well, that...

611
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,570
It depends on Dr. Tae.

612
00:38:13,910 --> 00:38:15,800
Me? Why?

613
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,590
This all happened because of Dr. Tae.

614
00:38:18,590 --> 00:38:21,480
So Dr. Tae, you should be responsible for it, right?

615
00:38:23,420 --> 00:38:25,220
That proposal for recruitment,

616
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:27,160
think about it again.

617
00:38:29,150 --> 00:38:32,510
Didn't I reject that already?

618
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:34,060
Dr. Tae,

619
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,300
don't worry about me.

620
00:38:35,300 --> 00:38:37,370
I'm fine.

621
00:38:37,370 --> 00:38:39,770
That's great.

622
00:38:39,770 --> 00:38:41,840
I don't mind either.

623
00:38:41,840 --> 00:38:44,990
Let him go to jail or go hungry. You can decide.

624
00:38:44,990 --> 00:38:47,820
Hey, that...

625
00:39:04,570 --> 00:39:06,160
I'm crazy. I'm really crazy.

626
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,000
No, Chief Nam,

627
00:39:29,000 --> 00:39:30,260
falsify medical records?

628
00:39:30,260 --> 00:39:32,140
How could we do such a thing?

629
00:39:32,140 --> 00:39:34,010
There's no clear evidence.

630
00:39:34,010 --> 00:39:35,900
At least the Food and Drug Administration must believe us.

631
00:39:35,900 --> 00:39:37,020
No,

632
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:38,980
only we believe you is useless.

633
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,940
Public opinion says you have falsified medical records,

634
00:39:40,940 --> 00:39:42,860
how could you not have falsified clinical results?

635
00:39:42,860 --> 00:39:44,060
It's a mess.

636
00:39:44,060 --> 00:39:45,460
Hey, Seok-ho,

637
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:47,420
I have to rely on friends at the critical moment.

638
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:48,960
Just let it go.

639
00:39:50,600 --> 00:39:53,420
Issue the final sales permit as soon as possible as agreed.

640
00:39:56,300 --> 00:39:58,170
I’m telling you, civil servants

641
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:00,190
are most annoyed by public opinion.

642
00:40:00,190 --> 00:40:02,850
The whole country is like a mother-in-law to jump on.

643
00:40:04,270 --> 00:40:07,630
Break some other stories to divert attention.

644
00:40:07,630 --> 00:40:09,990
I’ll take the opportunity to do it.

645
00:40:09,990 --> 00:40:10,890
Hey...

646
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,030
What did Director Hwang say?

647
00:40:29,030 --> 00:40:31,670
Is there anything to attract attention?

648
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:34,590
He said there was a serial murder case.

649
00:40:34,590 --> 00:40:36,590
-Serial murder? -Yes.

650
00:40:36,590 --> 00:40:38,210
A gang called Black Bear Gang

651
00:40:38,210 --> 00:40:42,650
killed police officer and escaped, do you remember that case?

652
00:40:42,650 --> 00:40:44,000
Oh, yeah.

653
00:40:44,000 --> 00:40:47,150
The leader of the Black Bear Gang was killed while trying to smuggle.

654
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:50,550
At the scene of the murder, the detectives said, it happened again, this time...

655
00:40:50,550 --> 00:40:54,270
It so happened that a reporter from the Social Department overheard them whispering.

656
00:40:54,270 --> 00:40:55,990
Are you sure it's a serial murder case?

657
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:56,980
Yes.

658
00:40:56,980 --> 00:41:02,140
But that way of killing is unique.

659
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:05,060
I've been asking around myself.

660
00:41:05,060 --> 00:41:07,630
But the police have been covering it up.

661
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:09,130
So I haven't found out anything.

662
00:41:10,980 --> 00:41:13,730
Really? Then keep asking around.

663
00:41:13,730 --> 00:41:15,550
Other than that case, nothing else?

664
00:41:18,290 --> 00:41:19,850
What about rich people gossip?

665
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,860
Don't people like to spread gossip about rich people?

666
00:41:24,860 --> 00:41:26,370
Which rich man?

667
00:41:26,370 --> 00:41:27,630
Bulhwa Company.

668
00:41:37,750 --> 00:41:39,730
Dr. I is on vacation.

669
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:41,800
So I made an appointment with another doctor.

670
00:41:41,800 --> 00:41:44,330
This doctor is also very famous in the field of hypnotherapy.

671
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:48,050
So it's really hard to make an appointment. You must take the consultation seriously.

672
00:41:48,050 --> 00:41:52,010
-Really? -During the consultation,

673
00:41:52,010 --> 00:41:55,230
don't run away or enjoy yourself to pass the time.

674
00:41:56,380 --> 00:42:00,240
If you have something to say, just say it.

675
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,450
I don't have anything to say.

676
00:42:01,450 --> 00:42:03,640
Yes, you do.

677
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,520
You're the one who has something to say, right?

678
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:07,780
That's why you said you wanted to call.

679
00:42:07,780 --> 00:42:10,660
Did you wait for my call?

680
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,480
No, I didn't.

681
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:14,700
I didn't even reply your message after reading it, don't you understand?

682
00:42:14,700 --> 00:42:16,830
I didn't want to answer your call.

683
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:19,430
Fortunately, I listened to Gak Shin.

684
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:21,010
I guessed you'd do that.

685
00:42:21,010 --> 00:42:22,790
I'm very smart.

686
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:26,650
Okay, fine.

687
00:42:26,650 --> 00:42:28,880
Be smart for the rest of your life.

688
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:31,860
Damn it!

689
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,890
Let's go together.

690
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:34,360
(Leung Sang-Hoon, Doctor, Department of Mental Health Medicine)

691
00:42:34,360 --> 00:42:38,740
(Department of Mental Health Medicine, Deputy Chief Physician, Leung Sang-Hoon)

692
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:39,650
Now slowly relieve the tension.
(Department of Mental Health Medicine, Deputy Chief Physician, Leung Sang-Hoon)

693
00:42:39,650 --> 00:42:42,970
Now slowly relieve the tension.

694
00:42:42,970 --> 00:42:47,230
Close your eyes unconsciously.

695
00:42:51,000 --> 00:42:53,250
When to relieve the tension?

696
00:42:53,250 --> 00:42:56,020
Why do I get more tired and nervous?

697
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,630
My trapezius muscle is a little lumpy.

698
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:01,820
Don't talk nonsense, just focus on it, okay?

699
00:43:01,820 --> 00:43:03,470
It's been an hour.

700
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:05,760
Paintings, pocket watches, and necklaces.

701
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:08,600
Are you trying to hypnotize or sell something?

702
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:14,350
Some people may be resistant to hypnosis.

703
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:17,760
I like hypnosis, but I mainly hypnotize others.

704
00:43:18,870 --> 00:43:22,660
I can’t get along well with this patient.

705
00:43:22,660 --> 00:43:24,960
-I'll give you a refund. You can go to another... -No, no.

706
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,320
No, no, I had a hard time getting the appointment.

707
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,840
Try hypnotizing me.

708
00:43:30,840 --> 00:43:33,310
Get out of the way!

709
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:34,370
Oh, my God.

710
00:43:36,150 --> 00:43:37,700
Watch this.

711
00:43:37,700 --> 00:43:43,030
Just lie down like this, relax.

712
00:43:47,610 --> 00:43:50,470
It's like you're about to be sucked in.

713
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:54,750
Your body slowly sinks.

714
00:43:54,750 --> 00:43:57,480
Slowly ease the tension.

715
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:01,850
Close your eyes unconsciously.

716
00:44:03,670 --> 00:44:05,730
Well, well. This kid is really weak.

717
00:44:08,080 --> 00:44:10,520
Now open your eyes.

718
00:44:10,520 --> 00:44:15,910
You'll be in the place where no one can hurt you,

719
00:44:15,910 --> 00:44:21,700
talking with the people you love most.

720
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,970
Please open your eyes.

721
00:44:38,250 --> 00:44:39,100
Is it done?

722
00:44:39,100 --> 00:44:42,440
I'm the one who hypnotized her. Of course it’s done.

723
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:43,920
It's just that you're different.

724
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:50,480
Okay, now close your eyes again.

725
00:44:50,480 --> 00:44:52,260
Why don't you want to live with me?

726
00:44:54,210 --> 00:44:56,900
I didn't say I didn't want to.

727
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:57,690
Then why?

728
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:03,710
Because I don't know

729
00:45:03,710 --> 00:45:06,490
why you want to live with me.

730
00:45:11,640 --> 00:45:14,990
I have told you I want to be with you 24 hours a day.

731
00:45:14,990 --> 00:45:18,750
No woman would live with a man

732
00:45:18,750 --> 00:45:22,240
for that reason.

733
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:24,190
Then what’s the reason do you need?

734
00:45:24,190 --> 00:45:26,250
You should like me.

735
00:45:26,250 --> 00:45:28,050
Of course I do.

736
00:45:28,050 --> 00:45:29,860
Why do you like me?

737
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:30,630
What?

738
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:34,720
I really don't know why women always ask such questions at such times.

739
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:36,770
Because you are beautiful.

740
00:45:36,770 --> 00:45:39,820
A colleague approached me because I’m beautiful.

741
00:45:41,510 --> 00:45:45,760
Then he went to find a more beautiful girl.

742
00:45:48,170 --> 00:45:50,820
Because you're kind. I like kind people.

743
00:45:50,820 --> 00:45:54,860
A senior who said he liked me because of my kindness,

744
00:45:54,860 --> 00:46:00,140
he borrowed my money and dived.

745
00:46:00,140 --> 00:46:02,160
Are you a garbage collector?

746
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:03,920
Is your hobby garbage sorting?

747
00:46:03,920 --> 00:46:07,370
What have you encountered that you are now testing me?

748
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:08,470
Yes.

749
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:11,560
I,

750
00:46:14,720 --> 00:46:17,650
why did I meet those guys?

751
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:21,650
No, I'm not blaming you.

752
00:46:21,650 --> 00:46:25,920
It’s my fault.

753
00:46:29,630 --> 00:46:32,910
I'm not confident in myself,

754
00:46:35,910 --> 00:46:38,650
I'm always inferior to others.

755
00:46:40,070 --> 00:46:42,230
I always show my flaws to others first.

756
00:46:43,900 --> 00:46:49,510
So whenever I have someone who likes me, I don't want to let him go.

757
00:46:51,990 --> 00:46:56,990
Then I find that the more I like them, the more uneasy I feel.

758
00:47:00,160 --> 00:47:02,860
If this person gets to know the real me,

759
00:47:04,210 --> 00:47:06,470
will he be disappointed in me

760
00:47:06,470 --> 00:47:08,250
and run away?

761
00:47:10,810 --> 00:47:13,700
If we live together,

762
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,720
I'm afraid you'll see me as a loser.

763
00:47:21,970 --> 00:47:25,030
You'll be disappointed

764
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:28,690
and run away.

765
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:34,090
I won't run away.

766
00:47:35,730 --> 00:47:37,450
Because I have no place to run away.

767
00:47:43,340 --> 00:47:44,230
End it.

768
00:47:48,780 --> 00:47:51,610
Please close your eyes again.

769
00:47:55,000 --> 00:47:56,970
If you open your eyes again...

770
00:47:58,170 --> 00:47:59,200
Don’t let her remember.

771
00:48:04,040 --> 00:48:09,640
You won’t remember what just happened.

772
00:48:11,380 --> 00:48:13,900
Please open your eyes.

773
00:48:28,550 --> 00:48:30,140
Quack!

774
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:33,160
How can he do business when he can’t even hypnotize me?

775
00:48:34,530 --> 00:48:35,850
Which doctor can check you now?

776
00:48:48,800 --> 00:48:49,840
Was it arranged by Kim Pil-soo?

777
00:48:51,450 --> 00:48:52,710
What’s that sound?

778
00:48:52,710 --> 00:48:54,270
Stay where you are.

779
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:55,070
Why?

780
00:48:55,070 --> 00:48:57,120
Why are there so many people watching me?

781
00:49:03,740 --> 00:49:05,010
Why are you doing this?

782
00:49:05,010 --> 00:49:06,110
I think this is the only way I want to see you.

783
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:07,020
You just cover your face like this.

784
00:49:07,020 --> 00:49:08,600
You’re really annoying! Really!

785
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:12,200
-Even at this moment, her lips are this attractive. -Untie it.

786
00:49:12,200 --> 00:49:13,320
Untie it!

787
00:49:13,320 --> 00:49:14,140
Untie!

788
00:49:14,140 --> 00:49:15,810
-Come with me. -Untie it.

789
00:49:15,810 --> 00:49:17,110
I’m asking you to untie it.

790
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:18,810
I can’t see. Untie!

791
00:49:18,810 --> 00:49:22,750
-I’m asking you to untie it. -The target is not Han Gye-jeol, but me.

792
00:49:22,750 --> 00:49:25,680
Now that I’ve received your gift, I should also send you one.

793
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,070
(What is the reason why the hidden heir of the Bulhwa Company hides in Yeongpo?)
Now that I’ve received your gift, I should also send you one.

794
00:49:28,270 --> 00:49:29,570
Send me one?

795
00:49:34,740 --> 00:49:36,620
You’re really not good at choosing a gift...

796
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:40,670
What do you think these can do to me?

797
00:49:40,670 --> 00:49:43,110
The whole world is watching you.

798
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:43,810
What?

799
00:49:43,810 --> 00:49:46,210
The whole world will help me watch you.

800
00:49:46,210 --> 00:49:46,410
(Chairman Kim Pil-soo)
The whole world will help me watch you.

801
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:48,180
Appear at any time and disappear suddenly.
(Chairman Kim Pil-soo)

802
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:49,470
(Chairman Kim Pil-soo)

803
00:49:49,470 --> 00:49:52,620
You must find it difficult to live like before.
(Chairman Kim Pil-soo)

804
00:49:52,620 --> 00:49:54,480
Thanks to that, I’ll be relieved.

805
00:49:56,150 --> 00:49:57,070
Interesting.

806
00:49:58,700 --> 00:50:01,570
It’s always interesting to see how short-sighted humans are.

807
00:50:03,210 --> 00:50:05,400
How long will it be interesting?

808
00:50:05,400 --> 00:50:07,000
Let’s wait and see.

809
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:21,640
Ok Shin, take the medicine.

810
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:24,180
What’s the matter with you? Is the world destroyed?

811
00:50:24,180 --> 00:50:26,900
It would be better if the world is destroyed.

812
00:50:26,900 --> 00:50:29,090
My company is doomed.

813
00:50:29,090 --> 00:50:30,830
My company!

814
00:50:30,830 --> 00:50:34,140
Today the stock of Ok Shin’s company dropped to the limit down.

815
00:50:34,140 --> 00:50:37,480
How can the company be good if the leader is like this?

816
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:39,540
Who is this all about?

817
00:50:39,540 --> 00:50:40,480
It can’t be me, right?

818
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,250
What did I do?

819
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:44,810
Lord Deity, what do you think of the risk of the successor?

820
00:50:44,810 --> 00:50:48,240
Lord Deity... Your existence is a risk.

821
00:50:48,240 --> 00:50:49,660
Do you know what everyone is talking about?

822
00:50:49,660 --> 00:50:52,450
He is the only child of the president, so the president can’t deal with him.

823
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:55,860
It’s said the heir has mental problem.

824
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,600
He’s been hidden for fear of being known.

825
00:50:57,600 --> 00:51:00,090
Rumors are spreading quickly.

826
00:51:00,090 --> 00:51:02,580
Leave it alone. It’s better than

827
00:51:02,580 --> 00:51:04,990
occasional but unceasing rumors.

828
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:08,370
It can’t go on like this.

829
00:51:08,370 --> 00:51:10,310
Let’s take this opportunity to go to Seoul.

830
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,570
Why go to Seoul?

831
00:51:11,570 --> 00:51:13,340
Do you want to enter the upper class?

832
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:18,060
Do you know why people are interested in you?

833
00:51:18,060 --> 00:51:22,080
-Because I’m handsome. -As for appearance, I should be more handsome.

834
00:51:22,080 --> 00:51:23,310
Take the medicine.

835
00:51:23,310 --> 00:51:26,200
Because you’re not ordinary! Not ordinary!

836
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:29,800
Since you’re different from others, you’re bound to attract attention.

837
00:51:29,800 --> 00:51:33,090
How in the world can a rich man live in a poor place like this?

838
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,010
Just like other rich people,

839
00:51:35,010 --> 00:51:37,760
we should live in a big house with high walls in Seoul.

840
00:51:37,760 --> 00:51:39,610
Eat fancy food like Hanwoo beef.

841
00:51:39,610 --> 00:51:41,620
Such a mundane life...

842
00:51:41,620 --> 00:51:44,960
The attention to you will disappear soon. Let’s go to Seoul.

843
00:51:44,960 --> 00:51:48,690
Ok Shin, how can you only consider yourself?

844
00:51:48,690 --> 00:51:51,220
Even if Lord Deity can save your company by moving to Seoul,

845
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,010
what about Han Gye-jeol?

846
00:51:53,010 --> 00:51:54,230
What about Han Gye-jeol?

847
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:56,840
Kim Pil-soo has got his eyes on her.

848
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,260
Are you going to leave her alone in danger and just ignore it?

849
00:52:00,260 --> 00:52:03,010
Even if it’s for her, Seoul is better.

850
00:52:03,010 --> 00:52:06,240
You can’t even go out with her in a small place like this.

851
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:07,480
If you’re not careful enough when dating,

852
00:52:07,480 --> 00:52:10,310
her appearance and identity will be revealed. Her life will be ruined.

853
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:12,730
Seoul is good. It’s crowded and easy to hide.

854
00:52:12,730 --> 00:52:14,370
There are a lot of police officers and it’s easy to control them.

855
00:52:14,370 --> 00:52:16,710
There are also many places that are inaccessible to ordinary people.

856
00:52:16,710 --> 00:52:20,960
In Seoul, take our house as an example, it’s forbidden to enter from the entrance.

857
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,530
It’s the right place for Han Gye-jeol.

858
00:52:22,530 --> 00:52:23,910
Let’s move there.

859
00:52:23,910 --> 00:52:27,430
So what does that mean? Han Gye-jeol should move to Seoul, too?

860
00:52:27,430 --> 00:52:30,250
-Aren’t you two living together? -Living...

861
00:52:30,250 --> 00:52:32,170
Living together? What do you mean?

862
00:52:32,170 --> 00:52:34,610
Well...

863
00:52:34,610 --> 00:52:38,420
I haven’t... I haven’t said that.

864
00:52:38,420 --> 00:52:40,030
Did you get rejected again?

865
00:52:40,030 --> 00:52:42,020
How many times do you have to be rejected by the same woman?

866
00:52:42,020 --> 00:52:43,090
Is being rejected your hobby?

867
00:52:43,090 --> 00:52:44,390
You’re really...

868
00:52:44,390 --> 00:52:45,890
-I should have put your mouth... -Kill me! Kill me!

869
00:52:45,890 --> 00:52:47,660
Just kill me! Kill me directly!

870
00:52:47,660 --> 00:52:51,460
Oh, damn it! My company.

871
00:52:51,460 --> 00:52:55,210
Go to Seoul! Just go there.

872
00:52:55,210 --> 00:52:56,420
Really?

873
00:52:56,420 --> 00:52:57,220
What about Han Gye-jeol?

874
00:52:57,220 --> 00:52:59,410
Didn’t you say you had been rejected?

875
00:52:59,410 --> 00:53:02,120
I already have a plan.

876
00:53:02,120 --> 00:53:04,480
So you should plan on moving.

877
00:53:11,520 --> 00:53:14,100
Jeong-won, that...

878
00:53:14,100 --> 00:53:16,440
Well, yeah, I threw it away.

879
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:19,980
You’ll have to suffer a little. But is that a bad thing?

880
00:53:19,980 --> 00:53:23,760
The patient transferred to the hospital had a crescent-shaped polyp on his record.

881
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:24,760
What’s that?

882
00:53:24,760 --> 00:53:26,830
Is it a sessile polyp?

883
00:53:26,830 --> 00:53:30,940
Ah, occasionally someone records it like that.

884
00:53:34,350 --> 00:53:37,070
By the way, did you throw my stuff?

885
00:53:37,070 --> 00:53:38,000
What?

886
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:40,730
No, I made a mistake.

887
00:53:42,720 --> 00:53:44,350
-Guk-hwa. -Em.

888
00:53:44,350 --> 00:53:46,770
Did you work with Professor Bae?

889
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:49,720
Yeah, what’s up?

890
00:53:49,720 --> 00:53:51,300
Nothing.

891
00:53:55,400 --> 00:53:58,790
Have you made up your mind to go to Seoul?

892
00:53:58,790 --> 00:54:01,320
But why does Myeongin University Hospital want me there?

893
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:02,970
Isn’t its internal medicine Department very good?

894
00:54:02,970 --> 00:54:05,150
They need a pretty doctor.

895
00:54:05,150 --> 00:54:09,230
Doctors like you who are beautiful, well-educated and skillful are rare.

896
00:54:09,230 --> 00:54:12,990
Everything is great. But I just don’t like the chief of the emergency medicine.

897
00:54:12,990 --> 00:54:14,320
I do mind this a bit.

898
00:54:14,320 --> 00:54:17,220
Who is it... Chief Choe Do-yeong?

899
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:19,110
Don’t worry. He’ll be replaced soon.

900
00:54:19,110 --> 00:54:22,090
That’s it. It seems to be replaced by Chief Bae Chang-su.

901
00:54:22,090 --> 00:54:23,660
I just don’t like this.

902
00:54:23,660 --> 00:54:24,890
What?

903
00:54:24,890 --> 00:54:28,920
You’ve said I can be the chief if I go to Myeongin University Hospital, right?

904
00:54:28,920 --> 00:54:32,850
But what should I do? I don’t want to throw shit at it.

905
00:54:32,850 --> 00:54:35,910
Are you saying I’m shit?

906
00:54:35,910 --> 00:54:37,850
You should be more careful with your words.

907
00:54:37,850 --> 00:54:41,160
Yeah, the same to you.

908
00:54:41,160 --> 00:54:46,340
Nurses can’t stand your swearing, and seem to report you because of the bully in the hospital.

909
00:54:46,340 --> 00:54:47,160
What?

910
00:54:47,160 --> 00:54:49,080
It’s all recorded.

911
00:54:49,080 --> 00:54:51,670
They said they would go to the police station, but I stopped them temporarily.

912
00:54:51,670 --> 00:54:54,640
Comfort the nurses if you have this time.

913
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:58,240
Let Officer Han Chul out, too.

914
00:55:00,450 --> 00:55:04,350
Are you threatening me for that cop, too?

915
00:55:04,350 --> 00:55:06,170
Who the hell is that guy?

916
00:55:06,170 --> 00:55:07,260
A relative of the president?

917
00:55:07,260 --> 00:55:09,080
The son of some rich man?

918
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:11,630
Of course he’s not a rich man.

919
00:55:11,630 --> 00:55:13,150
He’s just a police officer.

920
00:55:13,150 --> 00:55:14,780
Just a police officer?

921
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:19,410
Threatening me with a wide-area search team to save a police officer?

922
00:55:19,410 --> 00:55:20,710
Wide-area search team?

923
00:55:26,420 --> 00:55:27,630
What’s wrong?
(Dr. Tae)

924
00:55:27,630 --> 00:55:28,490
What’s wrong?

925
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,790
Let’s go.

926
00:55:30,790 --> 00:55:32,310
Waiting for you.

927
00:55:32,310 --> 00:55:34,960
I have a phone call.

928
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,110
A person I must contact.

929
00:55:38,110 --> 00:55:39,470
Not allowed.

930
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:41,960
No contact with anyone at this time.

931
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:44,210
(Dr. Tae)

932
00:55:47,170 --> 00:55:48,180
Okay.

933
00:55:50,930 --> 00:55:53,110
The number you dialed is temporarily disconnected. Transfer to voice mail..

934
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,500
(Officer Han)
The number you dialed is temporarily disconnected. Transfer to voice mail..

935
00:55:57,770 --> 00:56:03,040
Yu A-in, who on earth are you?

936
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:10,690
How’s it?

937
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:14,470
Nice lotus pond, isn't it? The lotus pond here.

938
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:19,250
Come on, let’s go. The lotus pond is almost the same.

939
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:21,100
Come and have a look at the courtyard. Courtyard.

940
00:56:21,100 --> 00:56:22,770
It’s very beautiful, right?

941
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,980
Live together with Han Gye-jeol... Oh my god!

942
00:56:29,980 --> 00:56:31,580
Hey, this guy, it’s impossible.

943
00:56:31,580 --> 00:56:33,030
Living together? Impossible. Impossible.

944
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:34,920
Don’t you know that Lord Deity will do what he says?

945
00:56:34,920 --> 00:56:36,380
He can do it no matter how.

946
00:56:36,380 --> 00:56:37,530
So you can say you’re a family member.

947
00:56:37,530 --> 00:56:39,080
What about me? How can I live together with you?

948
00:56:39,080 --> 00:56:42,030
There’s always a way to live together. Don’t worry.

949
00:56:42,030 --> 00:56:44,920
Don’t think about it. Don’t use that as an excuse to propose to me.

950
00:56:44,920 --> 00:56:48,280
-I refuse in advance. -What are you talking about? Housekeeper, servant, you can do a lot of things.

951
00:56:48,280 --> 00:56:51,320
-You dare want to be the hostess. -Even if you beg me, I’ll refuse.

952
00:56:53,060 --> 00:56:54,640
You...

953
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:56,910
If you keep flirting like this,

954
00:56:56,910 --> 00:56:58,410
I’ll just let you get married.

955
00:57:00,680 --> 00:57:01,940
One of the two of you,

956
00:57:01,940 --> 00:57:03,340
whoever starts the fight,

957
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:04,780
I'll take it as a proposal, okay?

958
00:57:04,780 --> 00:57:06,830
-Ok. -Ok.

959
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:09,180
Since just now you’ve.. Have a temper, don’t you?

960
00:57:09,180 --> 00:57:10,940
Your cheekbones are high.

961
00:57:10,940 --> 00:57:13,800
You strengthen your cheekbones!

962
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,460
It’s going to explode.

963
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:21,500
Very spacious and quiet. The courtyard is nice.

964
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:25,040
Of course, I’ve devoted a lot of energy and money to this family.

965
00:57:25,040 --> 00:57:26,960
You will be more satisfied inside.

966
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:29,530
Come on, let’s go inside and have a look.

967
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:30,800
Oh my god!

968
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:31,920
Devoted energy?

969
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,210
Ok Shin’s taste?

970
00:57:34,210 --> 00:57:36,850
A big trouble once they get in there.

971
00:57:39,340 --> 00:57:42,070
One, two, three.

972
00:57:42,070 --> 00:57:43,550
What’s this? What’s this?

973
00:57:43,550 --> 00:57:45,500
What’s wrong with my home?

974
00:57:45,500 --> 00:57:48,330
I almost lost my sight.

975
00:57:48,330 --> 00:57:49,720
What’s that?

976
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,150
Why is there gold flowing in the house?

977
00:57:51,150 --> 00:57:53,170
Come to dig for gold? Is it the heyday?

978
00:57:53,170 --> 00:57:55,120
Because I’m short of gold in my fate, I used some.

979
00:57:55,120 --> 00:57:56,350
Stop it.

980
00:57:56,350 --> 00:57:58,560
Decorate this place like my home in Yeongpo.

981
00:57:58,560 --> 00:58:01,600
Every screw and every nail should be exactly the same.

982
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:04,470
How can you spend money like that? I can’t do it.

983
00:58:04,470 --> 00:58:07,960
Really? Then I’m going to live in Yeongpo forever.

984
00:58:07,960 --> 00:58:11,170
It seems that the day when your stock turns into toilet paper is not far away.

985
00:58:12,460 --> 00:58:14,330
Deity... Lord Deity.

986
00:58:14,330 --> 00:58:18,630
Please, please, Lord Deity.

987
00:58:18,630 --> 00:58:21,280
Please, please.

988
00:58:21,280 --> 00:58:23,660
It seems that there will be more sufferings in the future.

989
00:58:28,870 --> 00:58:32,960
Why didn’t you tell me you were going to Seoul?

990
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:37,100
I even have to get your news from the report.

991
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:40,100
At least give me a call.

992
00:58:40,100 --> 00:58:43,600
Can’t he do that considering our relationship?

993
00:58:47,830 --> 00:58:50,280
It seems that

994
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,910
he is as far away as the stars.

995
00:58:53,720 --> 00:58:57,950
Won’t he shine around me in the future?

996
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,010
Come on in.

997
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:08,900
Hello.

998
00:59:08,900 --> 00:59:10,390
Why are you here?

999
00:59:10,390 --> 00:59:14,580
Where is Mr. Johns? Isn’t he here?

1000
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,350
Didn’t I say he was going to Seoul?

1001
00:59:16,350 --> 00:59:18,100
Didn’t you see the news?

1002
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:20,210
I thought he is almost back by now.

1003
00:59:32,810 --> 00:59:36,260
I’m good at judging people.

1004
00:59:36,260 --> 00:59:41,270
But I didn’t expect Mr. Johns to be such a great man.

1005
00:59:41,270 --> 00:59:42,440
Sit down. Sit down.

1006
00:59:45,700 --> 00:59:48,630
He can’t even work hard, so he’s not that great.

1007
00:59:48,630 --> 00:59:51,530
It’s not that he can’t work hard, but that he doesn’t work hard.

1008
00:59:51,530 --> 00:59:53,310
He is smart, handsome

1009
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:54,690
and from a wealthy family.

1010
00:59:54,690 --> 00:59:57,320
He was born with everything. Why should he work hard?

1011
00:59:57,320 --> 01:00:00,660
It’s not fair if he works hard.

1012
01:00:09,250 --> 01:00:10,780
Dr. Han, you’re really lucky.

1013
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:14,130
I thought he was a beast when you started dating, but it turns out he is a real prince.

1014
01:00:16,420 --> 01:00:19,580
These... What are these?

1015
01:00:19,580 --> 01:00:21,760
You’ll probably go to Seoul with the American, too.

1016
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:22,890
Right?

1017
01:00:22,890 --> 01:00:25,590
We’re here for the farewell party.

1018
01:00:25,590 --> 01:00:28,730
Farewell party?

1019
01:00:28,730 --> 01:00:31,100
Seoul? Me? Why?

1020
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:33,780
Are you going to live together,

1021
01:00:33,780 --> 01:00:34,850
aren’t you?

1022
01:00:34,850 --> 01:00:38,650
What? Why live together?

1023
01:00:38,650 --> 01:00:40,630
How can there be such an ungrateful guy?

1024
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:42,400
You brought him home when he was poor.

1025
01:00:42,400 --> 01:00:46,190
You fed and sheltered him and make him look normal, but he dares to abandon you.

1026
01:00:46,190 --> 01:00:49,110
I’ve never met a man who can succeed after abandoning his wife.

1027
01:00:49,110 --> 01:00:51,170
What wife?

1028
01:00:51,170 --> 01:00:54,070
I’ve never thought about that.

1029
01:00:57,910 --> 01:01:02,370
I thought I’d ask you for a favor if you get married into Bulhwa Company.

1030
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:04,560
Again, again! Nonsense again.

1031
01:01:04,560 --> 01:01:05,930
What’s wrong?

1032
01:01:05,930 --> 01:01:08,890
This kind of network is so rare.

1033
01:01:08,890 --> 01:01:11,750
What favor?

1034
01:01:11,750 --> 01:01:14,930
I heard the welfare of the canteen in Bulhwa Company is very good.

1035
01:01:14,930 --> 01:01:18,170
My cousin once wanted to be a cook. Don’t mention it.

1036
01:01:18,170 --> 01:01:19,890
The competition is too fierce.

1037
01:01:19,890 --> 01:01:24,310
Anyway, don’t mention bribing people for the sake of connections.

1038
01:01:24,310 --> 01:01:27,020
I wanted to rely on you as a backer

1039
01:01:27,020 --> 01:01:30,580
to work in the big company.

1040
01:01:30,580 --> 01:01:32,240
Forget it.

1041
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:36,520
What on earth am I not good enough? Why bow to people like him?

1042
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,030
Yeah, come on.

1043
01:01:40,030 --> 01:01:42,320
Drink a cup of wine.

1044
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:44,760
Forget all about it.

1045
01:01:44,760 --> 01:01:46,480
Ah, that...

1046
01:01:46,480 --> 01:01:51,550
They eat and drink well, and we should also eat and drink well.

1047
01:01:51,550 --> 01:01:55,970
Yes. It’s said that if there is a big difference, it’ll lead to misfortune.

1048
01:01:55,970 --> 01:01:57,150
Live a good life.

1049
01:01:57,150 --> 01:01:58,170
Yeah.

1050
01:01:58,170 --> 01:02:02,960
Well, I’m not much of a drinker.

1051
01:02:04,700 --> 01:02:07,220
Can’t you drink?

1052
01:02:07,220 --> 01:02:10,150
Then it’s not worth being alive.

1053
01:02:14,330 --> 01:02:18,210
Well, okay, then drink it to death.

1054
01:02:18,210 --> 01:02:19,010
Cheers.

1055
01:02:19,010 --> 01:02:21,320
-Great! Cheers! -Cheers.

1056
01:02:26,560 --> 01:02:27,940
Very bold. This...

1057
01:02:27,940 --> 01:02:30,910
Look how bold and unconstrained you’re.

1058
01:02:30,910 --> 01:02:33,220
Pour me another one.

1059
01:02:33,220 --> 01:02:34,610
Okay.

1060
01:02:34,610 --> 01:02:37,830
Oh, are you drunk so soon?

1061
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:40,720
Why can’t you stop laughing?

1062
01:02:40,720 --> 01:02:45,440
Worthless people are happy to be together even if they just look at each other.

-Cheers. -Cheers.

1066
01:02:53,450 --> 01:02:57,370
Pour me another one. I’m so happy.

1067
01:02:57,370 --> 01:02:59,170
Happy. Very happy.

Let’s go. Why are you so impatient?

1084
01:03:42,850 --> 01:03:48,100
I'm really afraid of strangers. Do you have to do this in front of people?

1085
01:03:48,100 --> 01:03:52,070
If I tell Han Gye-jeol directly what a great person she is,

1086
01:03:52,070 --> 01:03:53,860
she won't understand. So I have to show her.

1087
01:03:53,860 --> 01:03:57,610
Really? Public proposal?

1088
01:03:57,610 --> 01:03:59,130
Why didn't you say it in advance?

1089
01:03:59,130 --> 01:04:01,560
Is there a symphony orchestra hidden somewhere?

1090
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:03,320
You didn't call the TV station to shoot it, did you?

1091
01:04:03,320 --> 01:04:04,470
Anyway, if there are bad rumors now,

1092

You’re really...

1104
01:04:30,480 --> 01:04:31,980
No, at least let me know the reason.

1105
01:04:31,980 --> 01:04:34,400
Brother, what have you done for me?

1106
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:37,510
Why did you hide me? Why did you abandon me?

01:06:57,680 --> 01:07:01,380
I want to be independent myself.

1139
01:07:01,380 --> 01:07:04,000
But it turns out like this.

1140
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:09,490
An incomplete me like this.

1141
01:07:09,490 --> 01:07:13,200
Now the whole world will be watching me.

1142
01:07:13,200 --> 01:07:15,570
I don't know what problems and when and where they will arise.

1143
01:07:15,570 --> 01:07:17,960
I'm really upset. I'm going crazy.

1144
01:07:17,960 --> 01:07:23,940
Han Gye-jeol, I really need you now.

1145
01:07:27,070 --> 01:07:30,680
Can you always be there for me and make me complete?

1146
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:38,530
Why?

1147
01:07:38,530 --> 01:07:40,820
Don't you like me as a good-for-nothing?

1148
01:07:40,820 --> 01:07:43,080
Can’t you accept it?

1149
01:07:50,180 --> 01:07:51,960
How can I not like you?

1150
01:07:53,960 --> 01:07:55,920
Actually, I’m even worse than you.

1151
01:08:01,780 --> 01:08:02,990
I...

1152
01:08:03,980 --> 01:08:06,870
To be honest, I feel uneasy.

1153
01:08:06,870 --> 01:08:11,050
I thought I met an ugly duckling like me.

1154
01:08:11,050 --> 01:08:14,240
But later I realized it was not an ugly duckling but a white swan.

1155
01:08:15,640 --> 01:08:18,960
So I thought he was going to run away.

1156
01:08:21,050 --> 01:08:24,939
But he is still willing to stay with me as an ugly duckling.

1157
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:30,950
I know I can’t do this.

1158
01:08:30,950 --> 01:08:33,550
But I feel very relieved.

1159
01:08:37,140 --> 01:08:39,290
Am I worthless?

1160
01:08:41,979 --> 01:08:43,970
I’m worthless, too.

1161
01:08:49,700 --> 01:08:52,060
So what if I’m a loser?

1162
01:08:53,229 --> 01:08:54,720
It’s said that worthless people are happy to be together,

1163
01:08:54,720 --> 01:08:56,720
even if they just look at each other

1164
01:09:00,069 --> 01:09:04,939
for the whole day.

1165
01:09:04,939 --> 01:09:06,850
That’s great.

1166
01:09:09,529 --> 01:09:13,810
So you promised me, right?

1167
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:18,180
You promised to live together with me, right?

1168
01:09:19,890 --> 01:09:21,710
Yes.

1169
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:46,800
The murder case of Black Bear Gang.

1170
01:09:46,800 --> 01:09:48,810
There is a witness, right?

1171
01:10:58,020 --> 01:11:02,550
(Next episode preview)

1172
01:11:02,550 --> 01:11:03,200
Welcome to the family.

1173
01:11:03,200 --> 01:11:05,060
(Thanks to special appearance of Yoon Gi-Won.)
Welcome to the family.

1174
01:11:05,060 --> 01:11:06,600
Welcome to the family.

1175
01:11:06,600 --> 01:11:07,960
Do you like it?

1176
01:11:07,960 --> 01:11:08,970
Thank you.

1177
01:11:08,970 --> 01:11:10,440
But why kelp soup?

1178
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:11,140
Your birthday?

1179
01:11:11,140 --> 01:11:13,020
I’m going to buy a cake now.

1180
01:11:13,020 --> 01:11:14,310
It can’t be like this.

1181
01:11:14,310 --> 01:11:16,700
How can you celebrate your birthday without your family?

1182
01:11:16,700 --> 01:11:18,060
-No. -Why? Why?

1183
01:11:18,060 --> 01:11:19,420
Do you really think I’m embarrassing you?

1184
01:11:19,420 --> 01:11:21,220
He doesn’t like Do Jin-woo.

1185
01:11:21,220 --> 01:11:22,930
Is he the one you’re dating?

1186
01:11:22,930 --> 01:11:23,660
Are you crazy?

1187
01:11:23,660 --> 01:11:24,910
Are you really not afraid of him?

1188
01:11:24,910 --> 01:11:25,940
I believe him.

1189
01:11:25,940 --> 01:11:27,700
What if he is the murder?

1190
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:28,970
What if he is crazy?

1191
01:11:28,970 --> 01:11:30,240
Are you sure that

1192
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,000
he is the one who killed the Black Bear Gang?
