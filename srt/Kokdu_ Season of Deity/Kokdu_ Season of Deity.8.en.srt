00:00:01,320 --> 00:00:02,250
-Leader. -I’ve said that I’m very busy.
(Episode 8)

3
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:04,250
-Leader. -I’ve said that I’m very busy.

4
00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:07,040
-Leader. -Oh, you.

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,410
It’s a table, with the name Deity on it. Please look carefully for it.

6
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:12,960
-Fine. -There are so many recycle companies.

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,740
You cannot find it only with these.

8
00:00:15,740 --> 00:00:17,320
Double.

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:18,700
I’ll double the price.

10
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:21,730
Miss, you cannot even take a taxi with such little money.

11
00:00:21,730 --> 00:00:22,570
Just leave.

12
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,570
Go away.

13
00:00:25,300 --> 00:00:25,860
Damn it!

14
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:28,520
Then I’ll quadruple the price.

15
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:30,800
Oh, lady,

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:33,300
you are really good at capturing other’s heart.

17
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:34,190
Deal.

18
00:00:34,190 --> 00:00:35,620
Pay first.

19
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:36,870
Fine.

20
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,980
-Where is it? -What happened?

21
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,050
Miss, why are you tricking me?

22
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:29,910
It can’t be…

23
00:01:35,030 --> 00:01:36,160
Han Gye-jeol, no!

24
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:41,120
Han Gye-jeol, get out!

25
00:01:41,120 --> 00:01:42,420
Hurry, get out, Han Gey-jeol!

26
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:43,660
Be quick, get out!

27
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:01,150
Han Gye-jeol!

28
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,840
Just call me, please, call me!

29
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:24,700
Damn it!

30
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,070
Call me, now!

31
00:02:30,890 --> 00:02:33,829
-De… -Yes.

32
00:02:33,829 --> 00:02:35,050
Deity

33
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:39,480
Call me one more time.

34
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:40,910
One more time.

35
00:02:40,910 --> 00:02:42,120
-Dei… -One more time, Han Gye-jeol.

36
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,060
-Deity, come ba… -Han Gye-jeol.

37
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,579
You…

38
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:54,150
Why are you here?

39
00:02:57,470 --> 00:02:59,520
Miss Gim Yang-ja.

40
00:03:04,070 --> 00:03:06,410
Sorry.

41
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:10,350
Sorry.

42
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:14,270
No, it’s not...

43
00:03:14,270 --> 00:03:16,120
What is happening?

44
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,770
If you don’t explain what is happening, we’ll have to call the police.

45
00:03:21,770 --> 00:03:24,880
I don’t mean to harm anyone, please.

46
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:28,620
Please, don’t call the police.

47
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:36,160
What are you looking for

48
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:40,020
here?

49
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,340
The test reports.

50
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:43,800
What?

51
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,470
There're no other symptoms except for a little severe diabetes.

52
00:03:47,470 --> 00:03:54,270
My diabetes is so severe that I need insulin.

53
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:58,870
I was honest with my bosses at first.

54
00:03:58,870 --> 00:04:01,970
They said they didn't want to hire me because they were worried about my disease.

55
00:04:01,970 --> 00:04:04,910
They always fired me.

56
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:08,790
So I didn't say anything this time.

57
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,840
But I am afraid that the bosses would know.

58
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:13,730
If I'm fired from here

59
00:04:13,730 --> 00:04:17,160
I'd have nowhere to live.

60
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:29,770
Are you okay?

61
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:30,790
Well...

62
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:34,530
I haven't thanked you formally.

63
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:36,970
Thank you.

64
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:39,520
I’m glad that I could help.

65
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:41,950
But,

66
00:04:41,950 --> 00:04:45,220
how did you happen to be there at that moment...

67
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:47,760
Well...

68
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:49,880
Because I left something behind,

69
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:51,270
I just happened to come back.

70
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:56,120
Well…

71
00:04:56,120 --> 00:04:59,870
You just happened to come back and happened to help me.

72
00:05:02,710 --> 00:05:06,490
Since when did you start following me?

73
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:10,440
Since when did you know?

74
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:13,640
On my way to the hospital, I heard footsteps following me.

75
00:05:15,460 --> 00:05:18,640
I was excited because it's rare for a man to follow me.

76
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:20,180
Were you disappointed to see it was me?

77
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:25,140
No, you're not the disappointing type.

78
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:30,290
I don't seem to deserve it either.

79
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:33,840
That's why you keep looking for Deity's table.

80
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:37,130
Could it be that you followed me all the way there?

81
00:05:37,130 --> 00:05:38,840
Didn't you say you were scared?

82
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,130
What?

83
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:42,550
After Bak Chung-seong disappeared,

84
00:05:42,550 --> 00:05:44,530
you were worried that Kim Pil-soo was behind it,

85
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:46,090
right?

86
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:50,880
I'm just a human being.

87
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,409
I can't find someone and protect her.

88
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:56,580
So…

89
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:59,270
I'm just doing

90
00:05:59,270 --> 00:06:01,730
what I can do.

91
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,830
I'm sorry for troubling you.

92
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,690
You don't have to go this far.

93
00:06:09,690 --> 00:06:13,410
Seeing you're still looking for Deity,

94
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,550
I think it's necessary to show my feelings like this.

95
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:19,840
You don't have such feelings. How can you show them?

96
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:25,890
Professor, you don't like me.

97
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:27,640
Because I'm always in unilateral love.

98
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,840
So I know when I'll be dumped.

99
00:06:33,450 --> 00:06:36,159
When I was Deity, I liked you, didn't I?

100
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:39,230
I also wanted to know what I liked about you and how much I liked you.

101
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:42,980
So, I also want to take it all for myself,

102
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:45,340
the time as Deity.

103
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:48,530
Don't be greedy for the time that you don't remember.

104
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:51,370
You'll get sick from indigestion if you keep going like this.

105
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,409
I’ve already got sick.

106
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:56,690
So,

107
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:59,340
please, cure me.

108
00:06:59,340 --> 00:07:04,750
Deity to me might be like Dr. Jekyll's Hyde.

109
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:06,450
Multiple personalities?

110
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,920
Yes.

111
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,710
It's not medically proven.

112
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:11,900
But that's what I think.

113
00:07:15,710 --> 00:07:19,020
Although I don't know why Deity suddenly appeared,

114
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:21,090
what is certain is that the person inside me

115
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:23,350
is obsessed with you.

116
00:07:23,350 --> 00:07:27,820
That's why I'm worried.

117
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:29,140
Once you miss him,

118
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:30,550
Deity will reappear.

119
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:38,840
So you don't want me to miss him?

120
00:07:41,200 --> 00:07:44,270
I know you care about him.

121
00:07:44,270 --> 00:07:47,810
So you also don’t want

122
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,409
him to disappear from my body, right?

123
00:07:51,409 --> 00:07:52,940
That…

124
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:02,000
You’re right.

125
00:08:05,110 --> 00:08:07,490
I really can't lie.

126
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,160
But...

127
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,680
In a world where even diabetes has to be concealed with fear and trepidation,

128
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:21,700
how can I keep him in my body?

129
00:08:22,070 --> 00:08:33,830
Please help me destroy the personality of Deity in my body.

130
00:08:33,830 --> 00:08:36,650
Let me continue to live as Do Jin-woo.

131
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:40,190
Even though you don't like me,

132
00:08:40,190 --> 00:08:42,590
we can still meet as a doctor and a patient.

133
00:08:49,950 --> 00:08:53,050
I'll think about it.

134
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:54,340
Dr. Han,

135
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:59,400
Deity is an illusion.

136
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:06,880
Don't be confused by the mirages that appear and disappear at some point,

137
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,220
and be sad.

138
00:09:21,570 --> 00:09:23,640
Maybe,

139
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:24,960
you know my mother?

140
00:09:24,960 --> 00:09:27,590
Do I need to know her?

141
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:32,970
Maybe, you know my mother?

142
00:09:32,970 --> 00:09:34,800
Of course.

143
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,470
I know both you and your mother.

144
00:09:38,470 --> 00:09:40,950
As they have different memories,

145
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:44,920
it does seem like multiple personalities.

146
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:48,990
Why is Deity a mirage?

147
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,670
I'm so upset, so upset.

148
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:16,230
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

149
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:19,730
My heart was already invested in the mirage.

150
00:10:23,230 --> 00:10:25,710
So, this side is mine, right?

151
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:30,590
Anyway, you're so selfish.

152
00:10:30,590 --> 00:10:32,560
You're getting better at reading people.

153
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,200
I am selfish.

154
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:38,440
A miracle like me, the only one in the world,
(“Selfishness” and “Miracle” are homophones)

155
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,660
is amazing.

156
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,420
That's true.

157
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:55,350
I miss you so much.

158
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:01,410
Hello, everyone.

159
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,960
I’m Nam Seok-ho,

AXIS, a new drug for cartilage regeneration, will hit the market.

169
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:45,080
When Pilseong Bio is listed,

170
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,340
we will become a huge dinosaur comparable to the whole Pilseong Company.

171
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:52,050
Let's break the egg shell of Pilseong Company.

172
00:11:52,050 --> 00:11:56,920
Let's go out into the world together.

173
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:05,610
(Pilseong Medical Center)

174
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:06,200
Do Jin-woo really didn't know about the list? Are you sure?
(Pilseong Medical Center)

175
00:12:06,200 --> 00:12:09,100
Do Jin-woo really didn't know about the list? Are you sure?

176
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:11,650
Maybe he found out something wrong and lied to you.

177
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:13,900
I am worried about that too.

178
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:15,230
That's why I beat Bak Chung-seong up so hard.

179
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:15,790
(Jang Mi-sun Do Jin-woo Biological mother Bak Chung-seong(45), Seoul Pilseong Hospital, Medical Center, Head of Planning Team)
That's why I beat Bak Chung-seong up so hard.

180
00:12:15,790 --> 00:12:18,980
But no matter how I tortured him,
(Jang Mi-sun Do Jin-woo Biological mother Bak Chung-seong(45), Seoul Pilseong Hospital, Medical Center, Head of Planning Team)

181
00:12:18,980 --> 00:12:20,860
Bak Chung-seong really didn't know anything.
(Do Jin-woo(35), Seoul Pilseong Hospital, Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery, Chief of Planning Office)

182
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:27,020
There was no contact between Do Jin-woo and Bak Chung-seong alone.

183
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:30,820
It took 10 years for the new drug to come out.

184
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:33,120
We can't just sit back and watch a time bomb tic-taking.

185
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:35,160
I'll take care of it.

186
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,150
Either he dies from carbon monoxide poisoning,

187
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:39,160
or from an accident.

188
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,660
Let's treat it as an acute heart attack and calm the situation, sir.

189
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:56,090
Why did you put that away?

190
00:12:56,090 --> 00:12:58,910
Because I don't need it anymore.

191
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:00,170
Are you going to kill me?

192
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:02,460
You're going to die.

193
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:05,540
Tomorrow, you'll be dead.

194
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:07,460
Why does it have to be tomorrow?

195
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:11,780
Because tomorrow is the 49th day of your death.

196
00:13:13,240 --> 00:13:15,710
Do you think there's no reason at all having such a saying as the forty-ninth day after death is the final day?

197
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:20,950
It means that no matter how strong the soul is, it won't survive beyond that date.

198
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:26,050
So just offer your body, which will rot after death, silently to Lord Deity.

199
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:33,090
God has given you one day.

200
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:35,300
Do you want to spend that day on Han Gye-jeol

201
00:13:35,300 --> 00:13:37,480
or on yourself?

202
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:39,530
Think about it.

203
00:14:23,000 --> 00:14:25,450
You’ll die.

204
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:29,230
By tomorrow, you will be completely dead.

205
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:33,090
I

206
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:35,240
will survive.

207
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,480
Dr. Han.

208
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,350
Professor, what brings you here?

209
00:14:52,350 --> 00:14:53,480
I come here because I’m worried.

210
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:54,650
You are worried?

211
00:14:54,650 --> 00:14:58,380
I got a call from Yeongpo Health Center.

212
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,940
If I want to change the application for the pilot business license of the visiting doctor,

213
00:15:00,940 --> 00:15:03,670
I have to go in person.

214
00:15:03,670 --> 00:15:07,200
But I'm not in a good condition lately.

215
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:10,360
I'm afraid that if I go alone, something might go wrong.

216
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,240
Oh, fine.

217
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,610
I'm counting on you.

218
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,460
Hey.

219
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:26,480
Miss, I got the table back!

220
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,590
Come here!

221
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,730
Really?

222
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,700
I'm in the middle of something.

223
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:39,620
I'll be there in about two hours.

224
00:15:39,630 --> 00:15:40,480
(Deity)

225
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,770
They're trying to take the table down. I had a hard time keeping it.
(Deity)

226
00:15:42,770 --> 00:15:43,420
They're trying to take the table down. I had a hard time keeping it.

227
00:15:43,420 --> 00:15:46,200
Come over in 30 minutes!

228
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:49,400
Hello? Hello? Leader?

229
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:59,240
Something very important suddenly happened.

230
00:15:59,240 --> 00:16:01,970
Why don't you go to the health center first? I'll follow you there right away.

231
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:03,710
I'll go with you.

232
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,360
No.

233
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,010
What's going on?

234
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:09,720
What kind of relationship do we have that we have to go together everywhere?

235
00:16:09,720 --> 00:16:12,370
At least we're colleagues.

236
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:14,510
There are boundaries to be observed between colleagues.

237
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:17,730
Professor, you've crossed the line a bit.

238
00:16:17,730 --> 00:16:19,380
Then think of me as a patient in need of treatment.

239
00:16:19,380 --> 00:16:22,000
Who am I treating?

240
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,480
The Deity I've seen,

241
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,290
he seems to be free, even though he speaks viciously.

242
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:34,020
Not a bit distorted, very healthy.

243
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,730
But you, Professor...

244
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,090
You seem to be very unsettled and unhappy.

245
00:16:42,010 --> 00:16:46,350
Maybe Deity is the real person you want to be.

246
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:49,240
Why don't you just accept that?

247
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,520
That won't work.

248
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:57,260
We're two different people.

249
00:16:57,260 --> 00:17:02,940
Professor, I always thought Deity was the professor who lost his memory.

250
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,960
I was convinced that if you recovered your memory,

251
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:08,200
my future would be bright.

252
00:17:10,109 --> 00:17:12,339
But when you really recovered your memory,

253
00:17:14,410 --> 00:17:16,569
I had complex feelings.

254
00:17:17,270 --> 00:17:19,680
I felt like I was torn between you two.

255
00:17:19,680 --> 00:17:21,410
I felt like I was dating two people at the same time.

256
00:17:22,450 --> 00:17:25,839
I also thought I was crazy and out of my mind.

257
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:29,590
But after hearing your words,

258
00:17:30,750 --> 00:17:31,860
I finally understand.

259
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,020
To me,

260
00:17:34,020 --> 00:17:37,450
Deity isn’t another part of your memory, Professor,

261
00:17:37,850 --> 00:17:39,670
nor your another personality.

262
00:17:40,810 --> 00:17:43,300
He is just another person who is different from you.

263
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,130
You may think it’s crazy.

264
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:48,080
Though I know it’s nonsense,

265
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,510
how can there be so many things that make sense in this world?

266
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:55,050
Does that mean you don't want to help me?

267
00:17:55,050 --> 00:17:56,950
I'm not qualified to help you.

268
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,670
I'll try to find another doctor.

269
00:18:05,210 --> 00:18:06,210
I’m sorry.

270
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,230
Either he dies from carbon monoxide poisoning,

271
00:19:39,230 --> 00:19:40,910
or from an accident.

272
00:19:42,730 --> 00:19:45,670
Let's treat it as an acute heart attack and calm the situation, sir.

273
00:20:24,410 --> 00:20:25,700
Why did it suddenly snow?

274
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:47,310
Patient,

275
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:49,950
are you fine?

276
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,120
How dare you touch me!

277
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,270
Deity, come back!

278
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,770
Finally, Ok Shin has done something right.

279
00:21:24,640 --> 00:21:25,320
(Deity)

280
00:21:25,320 --> 00:21:26,410
So heavy.
(Deity)

281
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:29,320
You have to watch your own position, ah.

282
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:32,990
Deity, come back!

283
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:35,850
You can’t hear me?

284
00:21:36,270 --> 00:21:37,170
Come!

285
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:39,050
I’ve said, come!

286
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,090
That’s enough.

287
00:21:40,910 --> 00:21:41,770
You've called enough.

288
00:21:53,590 --> 00:21:55,100
I told you to wait at the health center.

289
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:57,100
Why are you here again?

290
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:00,950
I’ve been waiting too long.

291
00:22:00,950 --> 00:22:02,540
I was afraid that you might think we've been separated.

292
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,670
I didn't expect you to find my place after all.

293
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,320
You don't even say the honorific.

294
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:11,150
You seem to be very angry.

295
00:22:20,930 --> 00:22:22,590
I thought I'd never see you again.

296
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:28,480
The softer I get,

297
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,590
the more I feel the details that I usually ignore, the more I feel them clearly.

298
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:41,650
How soft my heart is now.

299
00:22:47,830 --> 00:22:49,800
Professor, have you gone crazy?

300
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:50,980
Why is all of this sudden?

301
00:22:50,980 --> 00:22:54,450
Any physical contact without the other person's permission is sexual harassment!

302
00:22:54,730 --> 00:22:57,090
I'm in a very bad mood.

303
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:59,630
It doesn't look like so.

304
00:23:01,340 --> 00:23:04,080
Why do the words of the perpetrators all sound the same?

305
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,220
Do they go to the same cram school for training?

306
00:23:07,750 --> 00:23:08,770
Of course I know how I feel.

307
00:23:08,770 --> 00:23:10,040
Professor, what do you know?

308
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,040
Look!

309
00:23:12,890 --> 00:23:14,510
My goose bumps are rising.

310
00:23:15,380 --> 00:23:16,770
My heart is pounding too.

311
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:24,890
What's wrong with my heart?

312
00:23:26,790 --> 00:23:28,410
It's been a few days without seeing you, and it's all gone to hell.

313
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,980
What the hell did Do Jin-woo do?

314
00:23:31,500 --> 00:23:33,410
Han Gye-jeol, it’s me, listen…

315
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:34,130
Stop.

316
00:23:35,810 --> 00:23:37,020
Professor, listen to me first.

317
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,080
I've already told you clearly.

318
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:41,990
I'm definitely not the type of person

319
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:46,300
who would date both you and Deity.

320
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,120
How much have I seen with my own eyes and heard with my own ears?

321
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:48,950
Well, it’s true.

322
00:23:49,370 --> 00:23:52,480
Most people who cheat will never admit that they cheated.

323
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,010
I guess that's how you've always thought of me.

324
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:57,760
Playboy who dates two persons at the same time,

325
00:23:57,760 --> 00:23:59,100
genius in playing hard to get.

326
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,270
That kind of person.

327
00:24:00,270 --> 00:24:01,410
Genius?

328
00:24:01,410 --> 00:24:02,290
How could it be?

329
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,380
Don’t misunderstand it. You don’t have that kind of ability.

330
00:24:04,820 --> 00:24:07,060
Then why don’t you listen?

331
00:24:07,830 --> 00:24:11,340
How many times have I told you that we're not that kind of relationship? Please draw a clear line.

332
00:24:11,340 --> 00:24:12,680
Why do you still want to cross the line?

333
00:24:15,040 --> 00:24:18,050
I mean... I don't remember exactly.

334
00:24:18,680 --> 00:24:20,820
What is our relationship now?

335
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:23,640
Is it before the Great Wall was built or is it under construction?
(Proverb Construction of the Great Wall of Miles: One night of love is worth a hundred of friendship.)

336
00:24:24,160 --> 00:24:26,860
You…You… You, again?

337
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,300
If you keep this up, whatever it is, it could be destroyed.

338
00:24:30,610 --> 00:24:32,090
Very good, you think clearly.

339
00:24:32,090 --> 00:24:34,950
A relationship between a man and a woman is definitely not the building of the Great Wall.

340
00:24:34,950 --> 00:24:36,600
Then what is it?

341
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,800
Don't you know why there is a saying that one night of love is worth a hundred of friendship.?

342
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:40,160
Why do you want to tell the story of the past?

343
00:24:41,630 --> 00:24:43,470
You want to say you've been to a place like Cheong Hak Dong?

344
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:45,350
Are you idiot?

345
00:24:45,350 --> 00:24:46,830
Don’t you know ordinary people, Peter and Paul,

346
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,480
Lily and Lucy, Jack and Jill?

347
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,400
What are you talking about?

348
00:24:51,270 --> 00:24:53,480
You might live in somewhere like Cheong Hak Dong.

349
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:55,450
This is a bit strange.

350
00:24:55,900 --> 00:24:59,470
From the beginning, you didn't speak with respect, you talked nonsense, and you treated me casually.

351
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:10,740
You are Deity, right? You are Deity.

352
00:25:11,290 --> 00:25:13,900
What if I’m Deity? You want to send me back again?

353
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,160
I’m Do Jin-woo.

354
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:22,390
No, you are Deity.

355
00:25:22,390 --> 00:25:23,860
I said, no. Did you grow up being tricked?

356
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:27,570
By the way, I already know that it's a relationship that destroyed the Great Wall.

357
00:25:27,570 --> 00:25:30,380
What will happen if you cross the border in that relationship?

358
00:25:31,020 --> 00:25:33,200
Will there be a war or will there be unification?

359
00:25:33,620 --> 00:25:35,950
Look, you are absolutely Deity.

360
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,670
Otherwise it would be impossible to say so kindly insane words.

361
00:25:38,670 --> 00:25:41,170
What? Insane? That's why you keep ....

362
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:45,230
Do you think it's very kind?

363
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,980
It seems like you've grown attached to Deity and you like him.

364
00:25:50,980 --> 00:25:52,900
You can't see him, so you miss him.

365
00:25:52,900 --> 00:25:53,970
So you want him to come back?

366
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:59,760
Professor, are you acting like Deity to test me now?

367
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:01,800
How does she know I'm testing her?

368
00:26:03,900 --> 00:26:06,290
I can understand somehow that you feel uncertain because of this.

369
00:26:06,990 --> 00:26:10,210
Because there's not much information on multiple personalities or anything in this field.

370
00:26:10,210 --> 00:26:12,190
So it's a case of trying to grab a lifeline.

371
00:26:12,460 --> 00:26:13,300
Multiple personalities?

372
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:15,280
But didn't I just tell you?

373
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,320
What do I think of Deity?

374
00:26:17,770 --> 00:26:20,140
Then what do you think of me?

375
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:23,610
So I can't destroy Deity.

376
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:25,930
So what do you really think?

377
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,700
I have nothing more to say.

378
00:26:30,090 --> 00:26:31,460
Please go for another doctor.

379
00:26:50,420 --> 00:26:53,720
Have you confirmed Daegwanryeong Farm and the land for Anshan Factory?

380
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:57,030
Have you confirmed it? It's not the land in Gangnam, right?

381
00:26:57,030 --> 00:26:58,450
Have you confirmed the land in Gangnam?

382
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:00,590
Yes, sir. All of it has been confirmed.

383
00:27:01,270 --> 00:27:02,650
None of them have been transferred.

384
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,830
That's good. Good job, Secretary Jang.

385
00:27:07,990 --> 00:27:09,370
What did you ask Secretary Jang to do?

386
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,820
To check if Deity has transferred other lands.

387
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:16,460
Why? Are you afraid that he gave it all away?

388
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:21,020
Yeah, I really don't know why he, as a bad guy, is pretending to be a good guy.

389
00:27:21,020 --> 00:27:22,910
Dung water splashed with white water will not become clear.

390
00:27:22,910 --> 00:27:25,500
Why does he always use my money to show off every time he goes back?

391
00:27:27,230 --> 00:27:28,750
Don't talk bad about Lord Deity behind his back.

392
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:32,380
Are you a necessary person to anyone?

393
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:36,490
Person? Person? I'm not a person.

394
00:27:38,270 --> 00:27:42,230
Anyway, this time there is no land donated because of death.

395
00:27:42,230 --> 00:27:47,480
In that case, Do Jin-woo is a lucky star, a lucky star.

396
00:27:51,970 --> 00:27:52,770
Damn it!

397
00:27:52,770 --> 00:27:54,770
Really? Am I a lucky star?

398
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,940
Do Jin-woo, what's going on? Why are you here?

399
00:27:57,940 --> 00:28:00,360
Do you want to give up your body now?

400
00:28:00,890 --> 00:28:02,020
Well thought out, Do Jin-woo.

401
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:10,370
So you guys are just lying comfortably and eating cookies,

402
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:13,310
while waiting for a free lunch, right?
(“Feeling” is a Korean homophonic joke)

403
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:16,520
It's a little ghastly. The dagger flew over and plunged into the heart.

404
00:28:20,070 --> 00:28:22,320
It's because you guys don't feel anything that I can't come back!

405
00:28:26,070 --> 00:28:28,090
Lord Deity! Lord Deity!

406
00:28:30,590 --> 00:28:38,450
Sin Se-gi, Yo-na, Yo-seop and Nana, are they all personalities?

407
00:28:39,220 --> 00:28:41,800
They're pretty and quiet, why eliminate them?

408
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:43,090
Yes, that's right.

409
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:46,050
Although they are pretty, after knowing them,

410
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:49,800
you will find that they are like a parasite that is attached to the mind of Cha Do-hyeon.

411
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:56,100
If it were you, even if the parasite was beautiful,

412
00:28:56,100 --> 00:28:59,580
would you let it live in your head or take medicine to destroy it?

413
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:01,820
It's not a party, why destroy it?

414
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,920
And Han Gye-jeol won't do that.

415
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,930
She seems to like me.

416
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:10,120
What?

417
00:29:10,690 --> 00:29:14,620
She said it herself that I'm very kind.

418
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:17,480
It seems that Do Jin-woo is not that good.

419
00:29:17,480 --> 00:29:19,140
She's a good judge of people.

420
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,500
Say something decent.

421
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:23,230
If she liked you, would she have sent you to the underworld?

422
00:29:24,860 --> 00:29:27,360
Because she didn't know at that time, but now she knows.

423
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,340
She must like me so much to go to my table.

424
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:32,230
May be because the table problem is so severe

425
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:33,730
that even the recycling center refuses to recycle it.

426
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:37,980
Don’t know how to cherish it until it disappears. This is the classic of classics.

427
00:29:37,980 --> 00:29:39,410
Classics are forever.

428
00:29:39,870 --> 00:29:41,150
In that case,

429
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:45,840
Do Jin-woo and Han Gye-jeol are too affectionate with each other.

430
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,620
There's no room for you to interfere.

431
00:29:49,150 --> 00:29:52,090
Ok Shin! Shut up!

432
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:57,700
Lord Deity, Han Gye-jeol is crying every day because she misses you.

433
00:29:58,240 --> 00:29:59,030
Yes.

434
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,330
You know nothing about women.

435
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:07,910
Didn't you say that they got together to discuss to destroy you?

436
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:09,470
No, no, I told them it's impossible.

437
00:30:09,890 --> 00:30:13,310
Lord Deity, if they thought of you as a human being,

438
00:30:13,310 --> 00:30:14,450
they wouldn't have that discussion.

439
00:30:15,040 --> 00:30:19,820
To them, you're just a pretty parasite.

440
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,390
An object to destroy.

441
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:22,770
An object to destroy?

442
00:30:26,020 --> 00:30:26,550
Come here.

443
00:30:40,050 --> 00:30:43,900
Creator, let me see Do Jin-woo.

444
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,990
I don't want to hurt him, but I just want to ask him something.

445
00:30:51,020 --> 00:30:52,670
What does Han Gye-jeol think of me?

446
00:30:52,670 --> 00:30:54,410
What use has he listening to that? Of course I should listen to it.

447
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,370
It's not a leak, so I'll borrow him for a while.

448
00:31:05,740 --> 00:31:06,540
Come on.

449
00:31:08,710 --> 00:31:10,760
I know you're listening. Do you have to do this?

450
00:31:12,490 --> 00:31:13,730
It's just a leak.

451
00:31:15,190 --> 00:31:16,770
I have a way to find out.

452
00:31:17,610 --> 00:31:20,950
Like, don’t like.

453
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:32,480
Like, don’t like.

454
00:31:42,020 --> 00:31:44,580
You might as well just admit to be defeated.

455
00:31:45,950 --> 00:31:48,190
Then I can change the person or the plan.

456
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:52,240
What? Do Jin-woo disappeared like a puff of smoke?

457
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,740
You're starting to talk nonsense.

458
00:32:06,820 --> 00:32:09,600
I think there's a problem with the car recorder.

459
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,490
Is that possible?

460
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:11,790
Of course not.

461
00:32:12,780 --> 00:32:15,660
I've been looking around because I guessed you would be like this.

462
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,110
But the EMTs said he must be dead.

463
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:20,860
Even his heart had stopped beating.

464
00:32:20,860 --> 00:32:23,750
But then he came back to life.

465
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:27,410
Is Do Jin-woo a vampire that can come back from the dead?

466
00:32:27,410 --> 00:32:28,390
Maybe.

467
00:32:29,320 --> 00:32:30,300
Jung-sik,

468
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:38,910
Things can’t be like this. You might as well take some time off.

469
00:32:41,230 --> 00:32:45,450
Do Jin-woo is not human.

470
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:52,080
So we can't approach him as a human.

471
00:32:53,800 --> 00:32:55,310
I'm here to tell you this.

472
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:13,010
How is Professor Do?

473
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:15,600
He was released in the evening.

474
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,570
Since he would be released so easily,

475
00:33:17,570 --> 00:33:18,910
why were you so violent when you took him away?

476
00:33:19,790 --> 00:33:21,270
I thought he was really a murderer.

477
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:24,380
I couldn't even go to him.

478
00:33:25,070 --> 00:33:26,320
I only said that he was released,

479
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:27,360
I didn't say he wasn't a murderer.

480
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,730
It's the same.

481
00:33:28,730 --> 00:33:29,730
Of course not.

482
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:31,790
Although there is no physical evidence, there is circumstantial evidence.

483
00:33:35,480 --> 00:33:38,480
He's disappeared again. How is that possible?

484
00:33:41,300 --> 00:33:43,090
We just ran into each other. Let me ask you a question.

485
00:33:43,480 --> 00:33:45,530
It’s related to the investigation.

486
00:33:45,530 --> 00:33:46,950
So you have to answer carefully.

487
00:33:46,950 --> 00:33:48,270
What is it?

488
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:54,550
Does Professor Do have a secret about his birth?

489
00:33:57,530 --> 00:33:59,840
Is being adopted a secret?

490
00:34:00,940 --> 00:34:01,620
I know it.

491
00:34:03,670 --> 00:34:05,750
What do you know about his parents?

492
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:08,380
They're dead.

493
00:34:08,870 --> 00:34:10,360
Are you sure he's a human child?

494
00:34:10,900 --> 00:34:11,489
What?

495
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,929
Could he be from some planet?

496
00:34:12,929 --> 00:34:14,460
Or maybe he's a broomstick

497
00:34:14,460 --> 00:34:17,320
with nine tails, who can move instantly,

498
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,770
and even emits cold air.

499
00:34:20,770 --> 00:34:21,750
You've seen something like this, right?

500
00:34:25,820 --> 00:34:28,139
I got it when you told me to eat instant noodles.

501
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:32,340
Don’t think of things as a matter of love.

502
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,870
Your way is quite innovative.

503
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,900
Maybe it should work well for some girls.

504
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,699
Bu’ I'm not.

505
00:34:43,699 --> 00:34:44,560
I'm not either, okay?

506
00:34:45,080 --> 00:34:46,469
Why are you grabbing me?

507
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:50,120
Just listen to me for a second and you'll change your mind.

508
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:52,060
No, it won’t change, so don't listen to me.

509
00:34:53,969 --> 00:34:54,699
Is that Jin-woo?

510
00:34:57,910 --> 00:35:00,280
Do you think I can't find you if you run away to the countryside?
(Did you think I couldn't find you if you fled to the countryside?)

511
00:35:00,280 --> 00:35:02,350
Do you think I can't find you if you run away to the countryside?

512
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,460
You're eating instant noodles with a man. You're living a good life.
(And eating instant noodles with another man, good life, isn’t it?)

513
00:35:04,460 --> 00:35:06,450
You're eating instant noodles with a man. You're living a good life.

514
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:34,100
Are you okay?

515
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:39,440
Help me. Help me get out.

516
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:43,120
No problem.

517
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:55,660
Actually, you don't have to be so dramatic.

518
00:35:55,660 --> 00:35:57,600
Stalkers should be dealt with by public authority.

519
00:35:57,600 --> 00:35:58,550
You'd better call the police.

520
00:35:59,230 --> 00:36:03,480
At best, I'll get a no-contact order and a smartwatch.

521
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:05,880
That's not going to do much.

522
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,300
But at least with these, he won’t warn and act in the short term.

523
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:10,310
(“Warning” and “Rashly” are homophones)
But at least with these, he won’t warn and act in the short term.

524
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:11,930
It’s indiscretion.
(“Warning” and “Rashly” are homophones)

525
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:12,660
It’s indiscretion.

526
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,400
Whatever, it is a warning or acting rashly,

527
00:36:14,400 --> 00:36:16,410
as long as it gives him a warning.

528
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:21,360
When the word gets out that a woman has a stalker,

529
00:36:22,750 --> 00:36:24,660
she'll be said as behaving improperly.

530
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,430
Only gossip runs in a small place.

531
00:36:26,700 --> 00:36:29,070
They're all delusional people anyway.

532
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,180
If you say nothing, they will only think that you are easy to bully.

533
00:36:31,180 --> 00:36:33,380
You should make a strong preemptive strike.

534
00:36:36,380 --> 00:36:38,880
Then you just keep picking me up.

535
00:36:41,080 --> 00:36:42,910
Why?

536
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:44,270
Aren't you good at preemptive strikes?

537
00:36:44,270 --> 00:36:47,550
I didn't practice it just for you.

538
00:36:47,550 --> 00:36:49,690
I pay too much tax.

539
00:36:49,690 --> 00:36:51,130
Can't I even enjoy this benefit?

540
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,190
If a civil servant goes out with a selfish motive,

541
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:55,440
he'll be accused of tax evasion.

542
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,760
Selfish motive?

543
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:58,840
Now you admit that you have selfish motive?

544
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:02,040
I'm worried, worried about this country's taxes.

545
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:05,790
Don't worry, I'll be worthy of the taxes.

546
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:11,540
Don't you want to know about Professor Do?

547
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:14,060
One question a day.

548
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,140
I'll help you.

549
00:37:16,140 --> 00:37:18,750
Do you want to go through 20 levels with me?

550
00:37:18,750 --> 00:37:20,700
Are you going to see me for 20 days?

551
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,410
Oh my God, it's hard to do it without selfish motive.

552
00:37:32,770 --> 00:37:36,340
Mr. Do Jin-woo left his bag in the ambulance.

553
00:37:36,340 --> 00:37:38,870
I saw your card in it, so I contacted you.

554
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:40,980
Why was Professor Do in the ambulance?

555
00:37:40,980 --> 00:37:42,770
He was in a traffic accident.

556
00:37:42,770 --> 00:37:44,730
But is he okay?

557
00:37:44,730 --> 00:37:46,840
A traffic accident?

558
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:49,530
He’s fine on the surface.

559
00:37:49,530 --> 00:37:51,220
That's great.

560
00:37:51,220 --> 00:37:54,060
He was in such a mess that he didn't even have a heartbeat.

561
00:37:54,060 --> 00:37:55,660
No heartbeat?

562
00:37:55,660 --> 00:37:58,050
Yes, because he had no vital signs at all.

563
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:01,410
We thought there was completely hopeless, so we were taking him to the morgue.

564
00:38:01,410 --> 00:38:05,490
He woke up suddenly. Amazing!

565
00:38:05,490 --> 00:38:08,410
Woke up suddenly?

566
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:15,190
Don't die in front of me!

567
00:38:22,390 --> 00:38:23,500
Oh no.

568
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:26,790
Then, he suddenly choked me.

569
00:38:29,300 --> 00:38:33,280
I thought it's time for me to go to the morgue.

570
00:38:33,280 --> 00:38:36,600
Deity! It's him!

571
00:38:36,600 --> 00:38:38,990
Deity is back.

572
00:38:38,990 --> 00:38:41,400
Wait for me back there.

573
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,980
Don’t disappear now.

574
00:38:44,850 --> 00:38:49,520
Like, dislike, like, dislike, like...

575
00:38:53,090 --> 00:38:53,920
Annoying.

576
00:38:55,510 --> 00:38:59,940
There are people who specialize in cleaning up and people who specialize in getting dirty.

577
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:02,500
This is the level.

578
00:39:02,500 --> 00:39:05,580
Like, dislike...

579
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:09,770
I don't know if I'm serving my master or raising a son.

580
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:10,770
Like.

581
00:39:12,340 --> 00:39:14,650
Whatever it is, it can't be a son.

582
00:39:16,250 --> 00:39:17,540
Damn it, these damn leaves!

583
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:23,840
Be gentle. It's not easy for them to leak.

584
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,730
By the way, how long has she been crying?

585
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,660
Who?

586
00:39:28,660 --> 00:39:31,050
Didn't you say that Han Gye-jeol cried because she missed me?

587
00:39:31,050 --> 00:39:33,340
And she was too sad to go to the clinic, right?

588
00:39:33,340 --> 00:39:35,800
I exaggerated,

589
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:38,720
but I didn't say she was too sad to go to the clinic.

590
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:42,030
No. She missed me, didn't she?

591
00:39:42,030 --> 00:39:44,340
Missing turns into tears and tears into sadness,

592
00:39:44,340 --> 00:39:45,300
isn't it natural?

593
00:39:46,300 --> 00:39:48,870
Why don't you just say you had three kids?

594
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:50,850
Han Gye-jeol wants to have children with me?

595
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,950
Anyway, she's in good health.

596
00:39:53,950 --> 00:39:56,840
But she can have three kids in two months, right?

597
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:59,170
How can a person have three kids in two months?

598
00:39:59,170 --> 00:39:59,730
She can’t?

599
00:39:59,730 --> 00:40:00,550
Of course!

600
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:02,650
If she tries her best, is it possible?

601
00:40:07,110 --> 00:40:08,230
Why don't you ask her yourself?

602
00:40:08,230 --> 00:40:10,460
How did she cry?

603
00:40:13,370 --> 00:40:14,230
Here you are.

604
00:40:25,480 --> 00:40:28,890
You really are as usual.

605
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:30,090
What?

606
00:40:30,090 --> 00:40:31,860
Be selfish.

607
00:40:31,860 --> 00:40:33,330
Am I? No way.

608
00:40:33,330 --> 00:40:35,200
If you were Professor Do, you would take the small one.

609
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:37,480
It's true that Deity has consistency.

610
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:39,090
What are you talking about? I'm Do Jin-woo.

611
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:40,880
Don't speak with respect, talk casually and treat others casually,

612
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:42,350
Professor Do would never do that.

613
00:40:42,350 --> 00:40:43,770
Is he a saint?

614
00:40:43,770 --> 00:40:45,850
Do Jin-woo also doesn't speak respectfully but casually.

615
00:40:45,850 --> 00:40:47,090
Ordinary people do that.

616
00:40:47,090 --> 00:40:50,280
Ordinary people don't choke others casually.

617
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:53,120
Here you are.

618
00:40:53,120 --> 00:40:55,020
You left it in the ambulance yesterday.

619
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:01,170
Be glad that the EMTs is kind.

620
00:41:01,170 --> 00:41:04,030
If it were someone else, they would have sued you first.

621
00:41:05,380 --> 00:41:07,540
It's time to admit.

622
00:41:07,540 --> 00:41:09,230
Mr. Deity.

623
00:41:10,990 --> 00:41:13,410
You are so quick to recognize me.

624
00:41:13,410 --> 00:41:17,700
I never thought that the gods of the underworld would imitate others.

625
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:18,520
What?

626
00:41:18,520 --> 00:41:19,640
Imitate?

627
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,800
What is that if not imitation?

628
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,180
Be glad that I'm not angry.

629
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,800
I should be angry. Why are you angry?

630
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,540
You made me go back and forth between this world and the underworld.

631
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:30,660
One moment you hate me, then you miss me, back and forth. You freak me out. Why are you angry?

632
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:33,920
You disappeared without even saying hello. So I am angry.

633
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:36,220
At least you should have the sincerity to say hello before leaving.

634
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:38,770
You made me have no time to say hello.

635
00:41:38,770 --> 00:41:40,090
People who don't know will think it's me when they hear it.

636
00:41:40,090 --> 00:41:41,450
No matter who hears it, he will think it's you.

637
00:41:41,450 --> 00:41:43,380
Nonsense.

638
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,310
I told you that

639
00:41:44,310 --> 00:41:46,400
language has the power to save people and to kill them.

640
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,030
That's especially true of you.

641
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:49,770
Is what I said a death note,

642
00:41:49,770 --> 00:41:51,350
which can save and kill people?

643
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:58,800
Deity, disappear, please disappear!

644
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,880
Please come back, Professor!

645
00:42:07,880 --> 00:42:09,790
Come back, Professor!

646
00:42:20,180 --> 00:42:24,640
Did you disappear because I asked you to disappear?

647
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:28,930
Every moment I passed out was accompanied by your foul language.

648
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:31,300
How could that be?

649
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,370
The foul language that killed me.

650
00:42:36,950 --> 00:42:38,870
I'm sorry.

651
00:42:38,870 --> 00:42:42,020
So if I don't say that, you won't disappear?

652
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:44,900
What?

653
00:42:44,900 --> 00:42:46,770
Do you hate it when I disappear?

654
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:47,620
Are you sad?

655
00:42:50,940 --> 00:42:52,350
You hate it.

656
00:42:52,350 --> 00:42:54,020
Han Gye-jeol really hates it.

657
00:42:54,020 --> 00:42:54,580
You’re crying!

658
00:42:54,580 --> 00:42:55,350
You must be crying!

659
00:42:56,590 --> 00:42:57,910
Well...

660
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:00,340
Of course I hate that.

661
00:43:00,340 --> 00:43:01,440
Why?

662
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,040
What of course?

663
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,070
Why would you take it for granted?

664
00:43:05,950 --> 00:43:06,960
Well...

665
00:43:08,820 --> 00:43:11,630
Deity, aren't you my landlord?

666
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:12,520
What?

667
00:43:12,520 --> 00:43:15,460
If the landlord disappears, what will I do with my 100 million won?

668
00:43:15,460 --> 00:43:16,340
It’s 100 million won.

669
00:43:16,340 --> 00:43:19,050
Professor didn't even know about the false contract.

670
00:43:19,050 --> 00:43:21,360
Do you want to get 10 years of rent and run away?

671
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:22,890
You're such a liar.

672
00:43:22,890 --> 00:43:26,950
So you've been just treating me like your landlord?

673
00:43:26,950 --> 00:43:29,520
I am a greater god than the landlord.

674
00:43:29,520 --> 00:43:30,300
No, no.

675
00:43:30,300 --> 00:43:32,270
If you want to be great in Korea,

676
00:43:32,270 --> 00:43:34,830
you have to be a ghost, a nine-tailed fox, or the King of Hell at least.

677
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:36,770
How dare you compare me with the broom and fox?

678
00:43:36,770 --> 00:43:39,340
Both brooms and dolls are equally small and insignificant.

679
00:43:39,340 --> 00:43:42,120
Doll?

680
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:42,700
Insignificant?

681
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:45,410
Living for a thousand years,

682
00:43:45,410 --> 00:43:47,050
I can really hear all kinds of nonsense.

683
00:43:51,370 --> 00:43:54,270
The Taoist Deity riding a phoenix can show the way.

684
00:43:54,270 --> 00:43:57,450
The Samurai Deity with a sword can guard the way.

685
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:00,430
This beautiful Maid Deity can serve the dead.

686
00:44:00,430 --> 00:44:03,790
The Talented Deity playing the flute can make the last journey more pleasant.

687
00:44:03,790 --> 00:44:08,120
I finally understand why the Western gods say not to believe in idols.

688
00:44:08,120 --> 00:44:11,590
No matter how handy people can not perfectly express the God.

689
00:44:12,800 --> 00:44:14,150
Look at the clothes they wear.

690
00:44:14,150 --> 00:44:16,140
I didn't wear such colorful clothes.

691
00:44:16,140 --> 00:44:17,040
Well,

692
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:20,520
I dressed more simply and fashionable.

693
00:44:20,520 --> 00:44:21,540
It is said that

694
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:24,210
they were made in the late 19th century.

695
00:44:24,210 --> 00:44:26,250
So they may reflect the fashion trends of that time.

696
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:27,890
Han Gye-jeol,

697
00:44:27,890 --> 00:44:30,770
You've finished investigating your boyfriend in secret so quickly.

698
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:32,850
You're so diligent.

699
00:44:32,850 --> 00:44:35,470
What boyfriend? Who's my boyfriend?

700
00:44:35,470 --> 00:44:37,720
But that's not the right way to investigate your boyfriend in secret.

701
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:40,020
Why are you drinking sewage in a sea of misinformation?

702
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:41,220
You should ask me directly.

703
00:44:41,220 --> 00:44:42,740
Only in this way can I show off that Deity is the best,

704
00:44:42,740 --> 00:44:44,840
and also the first.

705
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:47,190
Have you heard of the morning and the leader?

706
00:44:47,190 --> 00:44:49,420
Those all started from me.

707
00:44:51,660 --> 00:44:52,530
What?

708
00:44:52,530 --> 00:44:54,880
You didn't expect that I'd be this good, did you?

709
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:57,470
I didn't expect you to be so shameless.

710
00:44:57,470 --> 00:44:59,910
How can you praise yourself?

711
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:01,820
Only in this way will others know it.

712
00:45:01,820 --> 00:45:03,310
If I don't show it, others won't know.

713
00:45:03,310 --> 00:45:04,990
I know it even if you don't say it.

714
00:45:04,990 --> 00:45:05,890
As people,

715
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,640
if you are excellent, you will be seen naturally.

716
00:45:08,640 --> 00:45:09,570
Even if the sun is blocked by clouds,

717
00:45:09,570 --> 00:45:11,700
No one won’t know that the sun is behind.

718
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:15,620
There are such people.

719
00:45:15,620 --> 00:45:18,960
There is a person who is blinded by the cloud called Do Jin-woo.

720
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,770
And don't know that there is a sun called Deity.

721
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:24,000
Who...

722
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,840
Who said I don’t know?

723
00:45:25,840 --> 00:45:27,770
I recognized you at first glance.

724
00:45:27,770 --> 00:45:28,700
First glance?

725
00:45:28,700 --> 00:45:30,250
When was it?

726
00:45:30,250 --> 00:45:31,590
When you met the EMTs?

727
00:45:31,590 --> 00:45:33,120
Or when you received the backpack?

728
00:45:33,120 --> 00:45:34,260
There's a limit to be stubborn.

729
00:45:34,260 --> 00:45:35,300
How could you insist that you recognized me at first glance?

730
00:45:35,300 --> 00:45:37,600
Who do you say is stubborn?

731
00:45:37,600 --> 00:45:38,980
When we met in the yard,

732
00:45:38,980 --> 00:45:40,550
when you hugged me,

733
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:42,260
I recognized you.

734
00:45:44,270 --> 00:45:45,620
When I hugged you.

735
00:45:49,910 --> 00:45:53,270
How did you recognize me?

736
00:45:56,330 --> 00:45:57,280
Is it because that

737
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:01,580
your heart was racing, you were dizzy,

738
00:46:01,580 --> 00:46:02,520
and you couldn't breathe?

739
00:46:04,010 --> 00:46:06,590
Who in the world would be like that?

740
00:46:06,590 --> 00:46:07,420
Me.

741
00:46:12,550 --> 00:46:14,070
I was like that at that time.

742
00:46:14,070 --> 00:46:15,060
Weren't you?

743
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:21,700
Why did you ask

744
00:46:21,700 --> 00:46:23,910
such an embarrassing question?

745
00:46:25,140 --> 00:46:26,140
Well,

746
00:46:26,140 --> 00:46:29,270
a god should explore the past and present of human beings.

747
00:46:29,270 --> 00:46:32,990
So is this one of the sordid inquiry of life?

748
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,620
I'm not interested in others.

749
00:46:36,970 --> 00:46:39,030
It doesn't matter if they fall in love at first sight

750
00:46:39,030 --> 00:46:41,200
or can't breathe during their first kiss.

751
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,130
I'm just curious about you.

752
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:49,230
Han Gye-jeol.

753
00:46:53,160 --> 00:46:55,170
What do you think of me?

754
00:46:55,170 --> 00:46:56,010
What?

755
00:47:00,810 --> 00:47:01,940
I...

756
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:12,280
Deity is illusory after all

757
00:47:12,280 --> 00:47:15,590
Don’t be fooled by mirages that appear and disappear suddenly.

758
00:47:17,090 --> 00:47:18,480
Don’t be upset by that.

759
00:47:20,430 --> 00:47:21,300
No.

760
00:47:21,300 --> 00:47:23,070
You mean?

761
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:24,410
No.

762
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:25,550
What?

763
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:26,250
No.

764
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:28,200
No, no. That’s not the case.

765
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:29,500
Alright, alright.

766
00:47:31,860 --> 00:47:34,590
I’m not asking because I’m curious about what you think.

767
00:47:34,590 --> 00:47:35,800
Although I don’t know what people think of me here,

768
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:37,900
I’m that, you know, on the road to hades.

769
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:38,700
Famous person.

770
00:47:38,700 --> 00:47:40,310
I’m a really famous person.

771
00:47:40,310 --> 00:47:43,410
As long as I show up, the dead try to haunt me

772
00:47:43,410 --> 00:47:44,370
just in order to see my face.

773
00:47:44,370 --> 00:47:45,720
They even don’t know whether they died of thirst

774
00:47:45,720 --> 00:47:47,380
or were frozen to death in a snowstorm. That’s great.

775
00:47:47,380 --> 00:47:49,990
I’ve controlled the road to hades with my charm.

776
00:47:49,990 --> 00:47:51,810
If a person can’t be attracted by my charm,

777
00:47:51,810 --> 00:47:53,300
my career will be problematic.

778
00:47:53,300 --> 00:47:54,270
So I asked you that.

779
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:56,700
That means it’s out of professional curiosity.

780
00:47:56,700 --> 00:47:58,080
Can you understand me?

781
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:00,910
Yeah.

782
00:48:02,630 --> 00:48:03,560
Yes.

783
00:48:04,930 --> 00:48:06,040
Curiosity.

784
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,420
That’s curiosity.

785
00:48:07,420 --> 00:48:08,710
A lot of saliva!

786
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,040
Oh my god!

787
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:22,210
Are you a rapper?

788
00:48:22,210 --> 00:48:24,450
How can you talk so much in such a short time?

789
00:48:24,450 --> 00:48:27,480
Can’t you just shut up and go home?

790
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:32,380
Ahh, what a shame!

791
00:48:43,050 --> 00:48:43,840
-Pick them all. -Lord Deity.

792
00:48:43,840 --> 00:48:44,720
-Lord Deity! -I want to pick them all.

793
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:48,480
Oh, Deity, Lord Deity!

794
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:51,770
What’s wrong with the leaves? Why do you always pick them?

795
00:48:51,770 --> 00:48:54,240
How could they be right? How could they?

796
00:48:54,240 --> 00:48:56,620
It was the lame wizard who caught Deity.

797
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,940
Do they want to be safe and sound after leaking the secret like that?

798
00:48:58,940 --> 00:48:59,740
Damn it!

799
00:48:59,740 --> 00:49:02,440
That’s lucky, isn’t it?

800
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:04,620
If Han Gye-jeol says she loves you,

801
00:49:04,620 --> 00:49:06,920
won’t you just disappear?

802
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:10,260
Lucky? What do you know? How dare you say that?

803
00:49:11,570 --> 00:49:13,960
Have you been rejected? I’m asking you.

804
00:49:15,310 --> 00:49:18,820
Can you understand the feeling that you would rather disappear

805
00:49:18,820 --> 00:49:20,380
because of losing face?

806
00:49:22,460 --> 00:49:24,110
How can you understand?

807
00:49:32,650 --> 00:49:33,550
Mom,

808
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:40,130
God took you away too soon,

809
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,950
so I only have one wish left.

810
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:50,080
Whoever he is, I want him to be with me forever.

811
00:49:54,530 --> 00:49:59,770
But a man like a mirage always makes me miss him.

812
00:50:02,210 --> 00:50:03,850
Maybe I’m crazy.

813
00:50:06,680 --> 00:50:09,450
Mom, why don’t you come back and persuade me?

814
00:50:11,430 --> 00:50:17,410
Persuade me not to even think about a man who can’t share the future with me.

815
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:20,110
Okay?

816
00:50:39,900 --> 00:50:43,600
Ah, I don’t want to meet Han Gye-jeol.

817
00:50:45,510 --> 00:50:49,030
I have to pretend to be at ease.

818
00:50:49,030 --> 00:50:49,990
That’s it.

819
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:50,910
That’s all.

820
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,980
What are you doing?

821
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:57,810
How can a man be so weak?

822
00:50:57,810 --> 00:50:58,980
(The Dragon King's steaky pork)
How can a man be so weak?

823
00:50:58,980 --> 00:51:00,480
Eat what’s in your mouth and cheer up.
(The Dragon King's steaky pork)

824
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:02,830
Is it spinach? After eating it, my power will be infinite?

825
00:51:04,590 --> 00:51:07,880
Carrots are good for the eyes and the blood.

826
00:51:07,880 --> 00:51:10,360
Anyway it’s good for us.

827
00:51:10,360 --> 00:51:12,650
Don’t they teach that in American schools?

828
00:51:12,650 --> 00:51:15,540
You’re really a vegetable doctor.

829
00:51:15,540 --> 00:51:18,550
Anyway, if you’re interested in something, you’ll never stop.

830
00:51:18,550 --> 00:51:22,110
As a man, once you start, you have to gain something.

831
00:51:22,110 --> 00:51:26,020
My parents didn’t give birth to a weak Sim Hong-geun.

832
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:27,340
See? See?

833
00:51:27,340 --> 00:51:30,230
I was just fascinated by his manhood.

834
00:51:30,230 --> 00:51:30,950
You...

835
00:51:32,380 --> 00:51:34,690
Me? Is it because you’re an American

836
00:51:34,690 --> 00:51:37,220
that you talk to people in different ways once in awhile?

837
00:51:37,220 --> 00:51:38,840
I need your secret.

838
00:51:38,840 --> 00:51:40,780
What’s my secret?

839
00:51:40,780 --> 00:51:42,020
Singing? Or playing guitar?

840
00:51:42,020 --> 00:51:46,670
How did you capture her heart with your face?

841
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:50,120
My god, Mr. Johns.

842
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:51,420
Even if I look young,

843
00:51:51,420 --> 00:51:53,300
I’m not your type.

844
00:51:55,580 --> 00:51:58,440
I’m crazy! Crazy!

845
00:51:58,440 --> 00:51:59,340
Ouch!

846
00:51:59,340 --> 00:52:00,570
Hey, young man.

847
00:52:00,570 --> 00:52:02,250
Can you just listen to what the elders say?

848
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:05,580
How dare a young man like you...

849
00:52:05,580 --> 00:52:09,290
Whether young or old, pretty or ugly, there is only one secret.

850
00:52:09,290 --> 00:52:10,310
Work hard.

851
00:52:10,310 --> 00:52:11,190
What?

852
00:52:11,190 --> 00:52:15,040
Work hard to become a better man. Even a little.

853
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,880
Yes, hard work will never betray you.

854
00:52:20,430 --> 00:52:21,210
Work hard?

855
00:52:22,930 --> 00:52:23,860
Work hard?

856
00:52:28,730 --> 00:52:29,450
Choose!

857
00:52:31,710 --> 00:52:33,990
You’re going to buy me clothes and bags.

858
00:52:33,990 --> 00:52:36,520
Isn’t that old-fashioned?

859
00:52:36,520 --> 00:52:37,240
How about this one?

860
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:40,220
Hard to describe.

861
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:43,920
What about this one?

862
00:52:43,920 --> 00:52:46,580
I can’t wear the neutral style no matter how popular it is.

863
00:52:46,580 --> 00:52:48,650
Because it’s not for me.

864
00:52:48,650 --> 00:52:50,120
Why do you need to wear this?

865
00:52:51,470 --> 00:52:53,550
Didn’t you bring me to buy me clothes?

866
00:52:53,550 --> 00:52:55,270
I’m here to buy my clothes.

867
00:52:55,270 --> 00:52:56,870
To buy your clothes? Why?

868
00:52:56,870 --> 00:52:58,940
Don’t you know? Because I’m trying to work hard.

869
00:52:58,940 --> 00:53:01,820
Work hard to become a better man.

870
00:53:01,820 --> 00:53:04,070
Oh, you’re good enough now.

871
00:53:04,070 --> 00:53:05,570
Why do you have to work hard?

872
00:53:05,570 --> 00:53:08,700
I know I’ve been good since before.

873
00:53:08,700 --> 00:53:10,790
But ever since you turned me down,

874
00:53:10,790 --> 00:53:12,880
my career pride has been ruined.

875
00:53:12,880 --> 00:53:15,380
How can I charm people onto the road to hades with little glamour?

876
00:53:15,380 --> 00:53:19,180
So I’m working hard, and I’m asking you to cooperate.

877
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:29,480
Handsome. Handsome.

878
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,930
Like a bunch of flowers.

879
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:31,550
What?

880
00:53:31,550 --> 00:53:33,970
Yeah, you’re handsome and sexy.

881
00:53:33,970 --> 00:53:35,090
Sexy? Can’t believe you said that.

882
00:53:35,090 --> 00:53:36,170
Wait a minute.

883
00:53:37,700 --> 00:53:39,470
This is the gift box style.

884
00:53:42,170 --> 00:53:42,760
So cute.

885
00:53:42,760 --> 00:53:43,720
Cute?

886
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:45,340
It doesn’t seem to be a cute style.

887
00:53:45,340 --> 00:53:46,300
Handsome! Handsome!

888
00:53:46,300 --> 00:53:47,620
Handsome?

889
00:53:47,620 --> 00:53:49,480
In that case, one more.

890
00:53:54,900 --> 00:53:55,740
You come to choose.

891
00:53:57,550 --> 00:53:59,230
Deity, do you even want to wear women’s clothes?

892
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,360
Of course you wear the clothes.

893
00:54:01,360 --> 00:54:02,770
Me? Why?

894
00:54:02,770 --> 00:54:03,940
Why?

895
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:07,040
Don’t you think you need to work hard?

896
00:54:08,910 --> 00:54:12,320
No, I think I’m good now.

897
00:54:12,320 --> 00:54:14,780
Do you have no mirror or conscience?

898
00:54:15,870 --> 00:54:17,120
I don’t have money, okay?

899
00:54:17,120 --> 00:54:19,270
Fortunately, I have a lot of that stuff.

900
00:54:19,270 --> 00:54:22,270
Ah, forget it. I don’t need.

901
00:54:22,270 --> 00:54:23,890
These clothes are very expensive.

902
00:54:23,890 --> 00:54:26,270
You! Why don’t you have an enterprising spirit?

903
00:54:26,270 --> 00:54:27,820
I’m asking you to work hard for me.

904
00:54:27,820 --> 00:54:28,570
For me!

905
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,690
No.

906
00:54:36,690 --> 00:54:37,990
I said no.

907
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:46,050
It’s so red.

908
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,440
Too red.

909
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:00,090
This one!

910
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:01,290
It’s this one!

911
00:55:01,290 --> 00:55:03,980
Wrap this one and that red one for me.

912
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,040
Do you want to be a better person with this effort?

913
00:55:12,710 --> 00:55:15,620
Even a horse will be fed some sugar cubes before it runs.

914
00:55:15,620 --> 00:55:19,200
At least give me something sweet and then ask me to continue to work hard.

915
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:21,390
You mean you want to eat sugar cubes, right?

916
00:55:21,390 --> 00:55:23,230
Okay, okay. I got it.

917
00:55:25,380 --> 00:55:27,700
Oh, I’m so tired.

918
00:55:27,700 --> 00:55:28,680
I’m so tired.

919
00:55:46,350 --> 00:55:48,190
(The prince of KPGA Jeong I-deun, will join Pilseong?)

920
00:55:53,870 --> 00:55:55,910
You said that Pilseong would sponsor you.

921
00:55:55,910 --> 00:56:00,510
Yes, they start to sponsor me from this PGA tour in an all-round way.

922
00:56:00,510 --> 00:56:01,940
Why do they suddenly sponsor you?

923
00:56:01,940 --> 00:56:05,510
I know this is a good opportunity for you.

924
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:08,860
But does Kim Pil-soo have other plots?

925
00:56:10,840 --> 00:56:13,640
Maybe you don’t know, but I’m very popular.

926
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,630
Even without any intrigue, everyone wants to sponsor me.

927
00:56:15,630 --> 00:56:17,300
Yeah, you’re popular.

928
00:56:17,300 --> 00:56:20,750
Because you’re popular, you can wait for other enterprises.

929
00:56:20,750 --> 00:56:22,980
Why do you have to cooperate with Pilseong Bio?

930
00:56:25,590 --> 00:56:28,790
There are not many companies that can give me such strong support.

931
00:56:28,790 --> 00:56:30,730
I’m getting older, too.

932
00:56:30,730 --> 00:56:32,590
I don’t always have the chance to choose.

933
00:56:35,090 --> 00:56:37,520
Now I can’t confirm whether Bak Chung-seong hid himself

934
00:56:37,520 --> 00:56:41,160
or Kim Pil-soo did something to him.

935
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:45,260
I don’t want you to be involved with Pilseong Bio.

936
00:56:51,810 --> 00:56:52,810
(The prince of KPGA, Jeong I-deun, will join Pilseong?)

937
00:56:54,230 --> 00:56:55,660
What’s this?

938
00:56:55,660 --> 00:56:56,520
Whether it’s support or advertising,

939
00:56:56,520 --> 00:56:58,160
even if it’s a physical examination or something,

940
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:00,600
I won’t do anything with Pilseong.

941
00:57:02,920 --> 00:57:04,870
You may have misunderstood.

942
00:57:04,870 --> 00:57:07,950
I’m not suggesting. I’m threatening.

943
00:57:07,950 --> 00:57:09,060
What are you talking about?

944
00:57:09,060 --> 00:57:10,760
Five years ago when you signed with GL company,

945
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,230
did you say in advance that your cartilage was worn out?

946
00:57:15,370 --> 00:57:16,660
How did you...

947
00:57:16,660 --> 00:57:18,410
You didn’t say that, right?

948
00:57:18,410 --> 00:57:20,480
Who would support someone like that?

949
00:57:21,660 --> 00:57:25,250
In that case, it should be a breach of contract.

950
00:57:25,250 --> 00:57:27,230
You should pay a lot of liquidated damages.

951
00:57:32,560 --> 00:57:35,920
I know you better than you know yourself.

952
00:57:37,270 --> 00:57:38,840
So...

953
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:41,330
Shut up and join me.

954
00:57:41,330 --> 00:57:43,660
Or, the world will know the shameful things you did.

955
00:58:08,570 --> 00:58:12,240
Can you help me find Bak Chung-seong?

956
00:58:12,240 --> 00:58:14,060
Who am I? An errand center?

957
00:58:14,060 --> 00:58:16,200
Why do you always ask me to find someone?

958
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:19,230
I’m worried about I-dun and Bak Chung-seong.

959
00:58:19,230 --> 00:58:20,480
I-dun...

960
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:22,000
Why did you suddenly call him I-dun?

961
00:58:22,000 --> 00:58:24,890
Why did you casually remove the surname given by his parents?

962
00:58:24,890 --> 00:58:27,000
Why do you suddenly talk about this?

963
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:28,570
After I help you find Bak Chung-seong,

964
00:58:28,570 --> 00:58:30,480
you’ll be with I-dun again, right?

965
00:58:30,480 --> 00:58:32,560
I don’t want to see that. I don’t like it.

966
00:58:34,060 --> 00:58:35,530
Alright.

967
00:58:39,410 --> 00:58:41,770
-What’s going on? -What?

968
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:42,980
Become a better person.

969
00:58:42,980 --> 00:58:44,990
If you want to please people, don’t use money, use your heart.

970
00:58:44,990 --> 00:58:46,330
What, what.

971
00:58:46,330 --> 00:58:48,990
Why don’t you say that when you’re supposed to say it?

972
00:58:50,950 --> 00:58:53,270
You’re not a treasure stick.

973
00:58:53,270 --> 00:58:56,260
Don’t you think you always make excessive demands?

974
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,240
So now you’re comparing me with a treasure stick?

975
00:59:01,240 --> 00:59:03,100
What?

976
00:59:03,100 --> 00:59:04,090
No.

977
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:05,530
No, no.

978
00:59:05,530 --> 00:59:06,930
No, no.

979
00:59:06,930 --> 00:59:07,780
-How can I do that? -I guess so.

980
00:59:07,780 --> 00:59:10,290
You did it. Did a comparison.

981
00:59:10,290 --> 00:59:12,540
How dare you compare wood with the God of the underworld!

982
00:59:12,540 --> 00:59:14,790
Wait for me. I’ll find it for you right away.

983
00:59:14,790 --> 00:59:18,250
Hum... Treasure stick.

984
00:59:18,250 --> 00:59:19,930
I didn’t mean that.

985
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:25,000
What?

986
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:27,200
Why did I come to a place like this?

987
00:59:52,580 --> 00:59:53,780
Dead?

988
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,650
Ji Min’s mom, I’m so sorry that I leave alone.

989
00:59:59,650 --> 01:00:03,170
I don’t want to be the dad that Ji Min will be ashamed of.

990
01:00:05,080 --> 01:00:08,150
What... Kill... Kill someone?

991
01:00:08,150 --> 01:00:11,730
The one who ran away in order to survive because he was afraid of Kim Pil-soo.

992
01:00:11,730 --> 01:00:15,820
When Do Jin-woo said it had nothing to do with Kim Pil-soo,

993
01:00:15,820 --> 01:00:19,520
the guy should have turned himself in immediately.

994
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:23,570
If he would commit suicide, he wouldn’t run in the first place.

995
01:00:25,660 --> 01:00:29,460
Then who killed Bak Chung-seong...

996
01:00:29,460 --> 01:00:30,890
What’s the matter with you?

997
01:00:30,890 --> 01:00:34,260
Are you threatened by Pilseong?

998
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:36,910
Professor Do, your accident was not an ordinary accident.

999
01:00:36,910 --> 01:00:39,420
It was designed by Kim Pil-soo.

1000
01:00:39,420 --> 01:00:42,730
Do you still doubt Kim Pil-soo?

1001
01:00:43,730 --> 01:00:44,660
But...

1002
01:00:44,660 --> 01:00:47,050
Do Jin-woo said he wasn’t involved.

1003
01:00:47,050 --> 01:00:51,090
Who knows if he was talking nonsense for his own survival?

1004
01:00:56,230 --> 01:00:58,220
I’m going to find out.

1005
01:01:01,840 --> 01:01:04,220
Kim Pil-soo, you...

1006
01:01:47,940 --> 01:01:50,340
I got you, you rat.

1007
01:02:17,320 --> 01:02:20,270
Why didn’t I see it then? Why?

1008
01:02:21,450 --> 01:02:24,390
But the Creator is still chivalrous.

1009
01:02:24,390 --> 01:02:28,320
Dispose of all the garbage around Han Gye-jeol in time.

1010
01:02:31,590 --> 01:02:33,620
Kim Pil-soo.

1011
01:02:47,160 --> 01:02:51,260
You... Who are you?

1012
01:02:51,260 --> 01:02:53,550
Deity.

1013
01:02:53,550 --> 01:02:57,470
Come to deal with trash like you... The King on the road to hades.

1014
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:02,790
Well, well.

1015
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:11,290
Hide yourself like a rat.

1016
01:03:11,290 --> 01:03:14,120
You don’t even know my name?

1017
01:03:14,120 --> 01:03:20,230
As a criminal, you have no sincerity at all.

1018
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:37,780
We... Talk... Just talk.

1019
01:03:37,780 --> 01:03:42,100
Then you should have started talking from the beginning.

1020
01:03:42,100 --> 01:03:44,880
An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.

1021
01:03:44,880 --> 01:03:46,700
Kill for kill.

1022
01:03:46,700 --> 01:03:48,280
This is my rule.

1023
01:03:48,370 --> 01:03:50,240
Don’t rush.

1024
01:03:50,470 --> 01:03:52,340
Do you know how many cameras are in this room?

1025
01:04:35,840 --> 01:04:37,120
You can’t kill me,

1026
01:04:37,660 --> 01:04:40,440
even if the ghost’s grandpa comes, let alone the ghost.

1027
01:04:41,150 --> 01:04:43,560
Because I’m on top of you.

1028
01:04:43,830 --> 01:04:45,730
You don’t believe in death until you’re dead.

1029
01:04:46,060 --> 01:04:48,130
This is the tragedy of your human beings.

1030
01:04:55,830 --> 01:04:57,590
Professor!

1031
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:00,240
Are you crazy? Let go!

1032
01:05:04,130 --> 01:05:05,420
Chairman, are you okay?

1033
01:05:06,920 --> 01:05:08,020
Why are you here?

1034
01:05:08,780 --> 01:05:10,400
He said he had a proposal, so I came.

1035
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:11,620
Proposal? What proposal?

1036
01:05:11,620 --> 01:05:12,560
Did he threaten you?

1037
01:05:12,560 --> 01:05:14,630
-Professor Do. -That...

1038
01:05:14,630 --> 01:05:17,040
I heard that you are not normal both physically and mentally.

1039
01:05:17,040 --> 01:05:18,890
But I didn’t expect it to be like this.

1040
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,090
Dr. Han, you’re too careless.

1041
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:25,270
You should take him to a big hospital for examination since he’s like this now.

1042
01:05:25,270 --> 01:05:26,550
Shut up!

1043
01:05:26,550 --> 01:05:28,230
Stop it, Professor.

1044
01:05:28,550 --> 01:05:30,200
Go out. Let’s go out.

1045
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:32,080
You leave first. I have something to talk to him.

1046
01:05:32,080 --> 01:05:35,100
Maybe later when you’ve calmed down.

1047
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:36,700
Dr. Han,

1048
01:05:37,420 --> 01:05:39,150
I had a great shock today.

1049
01:05:39,520 --> 01:05:41,510
I don’t want to see Professor Do again for a while.

1050
01:05:44,170 --> 01:05:45,380
Don’t let him come.

1051
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:47,620
Please help me persuade him.

1052
01:05:49,490 --> 01:05:50,630
That guy, does...

1053
01:05:51,270 --> 01:05:52,280
He knows something?

1054
01:05:53,470 --> 01:05:55,650
Professor knows whether to leave or not.

1055
01:05:56,300 --> 01:05:57,780
Why should I say that to him?

1056
01:05:58,010 --> 01:05:59,510
I say this because

1057
01:05:59,950 --> 01:06:01,390
I don’t want to deal with it by legal means.

1058
01:06:03,400 --> 01:06:04,420
What?

1059
01:06:08,950 --> 01:06:12,960
At this level, he should be banned from approaching people.

1060
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:16,590
But if I do this, Professor Do’s career is over.

1061
01:06:17,950 --> 01:06:19,460
If you promise to persuade him,

1062
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:21,930
I will trust you this time.

1063
01:06:23,660 --> 01:06:24,800
Don’t listen to his nonsense.

1064
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:36,980
Yeah, Deity.

1065
01:06:37,650 --> 01:06:39,470
Don’t meet Chairman for the time being.

1066
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:40,770
I told you not to do this.

1067
01:06:44,120 --> 01:06:48,950
I told you, I’m on top of you.

1068
01:07:09,460 --> 01:07:10,320
Are you crazy?

1069
01:07:11,060 --> 01:07:12,870
You knew where it is and you came.

1070
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:14,380
What’s the proposal?

1071
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:16,160
I got an invitation.

1072
01:07:16,450 --> 01:07:19,090
It said there was a misunderstanding, and they hope I can come back to Pilseong.

1073
01:07:19,680 --> 01:07:20,930
Did you...

1074
01:07:21,160 --> 01:07:22,820
Haven’t you accepted the offer yet?

1075
01:07:23,620 --> 01:07:27,610
That... I’m indeed thinking about moving to Seoul.

1076
01:07:28,270 --> 01:07:31,700
You have to think about it. Please think about it more often.

1077
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:33,900
What did I tell you before? You mustn’t go back there.

1078
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:36,760
No matter Pilseong or something else is your grave.

1079
01:07:37,880 --> 01:07:39,970
Then why did you come here?

1080
01:07:40,670 --> 01:07:42,870
Did you come here to avenge for Do Jin-woo?

1081
01:07:43,270 --> 01:07:45,600
You want to destroy Kim Pil-soo and Deity?

1082
01:07:45,770 --> 01:07:46,980
You came here to destroy everything?

1083
01:07:47,160 --> 01:07:49,550
Who on earth suddenly appeared and ruined all this?

1084
01:07:49,720 --> 01:07:50,600
Do you think

1085
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:53,370
I’ll be with you for thousands of years to protect you?

1086
01:07:53,520 --> 01:07:54,440
I must have said that before

1087
01:07:54,590 --> 01:07:55,650
my time in the world is very short.

1088
01:07:55,800 --> 01:07:57,550
I want to solve all the problems in this period before I leave.

1089
01:07:57,720 --> 01:07:59,260
So I can rest assured, right?

1090
01:07:59,510 --> 01:08:00,520
Solve?

1091
01:08:01,540 --> 01:08:03,670
Is this the solution you want?

1092
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:07,510
Kill Kim Pil-soo and disappear again?

1093
01:08:08,510 --> 01:08:10,950
Have you ever thought about what will happen to the one left by you?

1094
01:08:12,090 --> 01:08:15,490
I let you come to this point, and have stood by and watched.

1095
01:08:15,930 --> 01:08:18,160
How regretful I will be in the future?

1096
01:08:18,450 --> 01:08:20,479
Haven’t you thought about it?

1097
01:08:22,640 --> 01:08:25,950
I know you don’t have much time.

1098
01:08:26,660 --> 01:08:29,270
But you can’t be reckless because it’s short.

1099
01:08:31,270 --> 01:08:32,870
Just like snow in the summer,

1100
01:08:33,229 --> 01:08:34,840
a mirage in the desert,

1101
01:08:35,340 --> 01:08:37,870
they’re more precious because of their short life.

1102
01:08:38,649 --> 01:08:40,410
During that short period,

1103
01:08:40,620 --> 01:08:43,050
can’t you try to be a better person?

1104
01:08:46,270 --> 01:08:47,700
And what am I doing this for?

1105
01:08:50,410 --> 01:08:51,649
For me.

1106
01:08:54,050 --> 01:08:55,120
What?

1107
01:08:56,240 --> 01:09:00,350
For me, you need to get counseling.

1108
01:09:00,720 --> 01:09:02,600
Please try to make an effort to receive treatment.

1109
01:09:03,939 --> 01:09:06,500
Then I will try for you too.

1110
01:09:11,790 --> 01:09:13,380
Please don’t misunderstand. Listen to me, Han Gye-jeol.

1111
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:15,069
You’re just a human being.

1112
01:09:15,740 --> 01:09:18,270
How will you try for me?

1113
01:09:19,750 --> 01:09:21,340
I’ll try not to run away,

1114
01:09:23,500 --> 01:09:25,050
and be more honest.

1115
01:09:27,609 --> 01:09:29,550
Although the summer is short,

1116
01:09:29,700 --> 01:09:31,960
just like the cicadas who treat the summer day as their whole life,

1117
01:09:33,800 --> 01:09:36,340
we should treat this moment as our whole life.

1118
01:09:38,550 --> 01:09:39,700
You...

1119
01:09:39,979 --> 01:09:42,910
You once asked me how I think of you.

1120
01:09:44,370 --> 01:09:46,120
I’m sorry I’m late in answering.

1121
01:09:48,340 --> 01:09:49,810
I...

1122
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:51,979
love

1123
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,050
you...

1124
01:10:07,590 --> 01:10:10,380
There is a time for everything.

1125
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,110
Even if I don’t know when the separation will come,

1126
01:10:13,650 --> 01:10:15,210
and all this will disappear,

1127
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:18,360
at this moment,

1128
01:10:20,840 --> 01:10:22,410
we should fall in love.

1129
01:10:55,600 --> 01:10:58,410
(Deity’s Season)

1130
01:10:58,410 --> 01:11:00,010
(Next episode preview)
(Deity’s Season)

1131
01:11:00,170 --> 01:11:02,620
What did we do last night?

1132
01:11:02,880 --> 01:11:03,730
We slept.

1133
01:11:03,730 --> 01:11:04,670
What?

1134
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:07,420
Han Gye-jeol, you once said you didn’t like sad endings.

1135
01:11:07,420 --> 01:11:08,540
How about living together?

1136
01:11:08,540 --> 01:11:09,790
Are you normal now?

1137
01:11:09,790 --> 01:11:11,620
Can I be normal?

1138
01:11:11,620 --> 01:11:14,050
But I really need you now.

1139
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:16,890
Are you crazy?

1140
01:11:17,090 --> 01:11:18,210
Living together?

1141
01:11:18,210 --> 01:11:20,300
Kim Pil-soo will fight back immediately.

1142
01:11:20,300 --> 01:11:22,320
We must be prepared for everything.

1143
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:23,730
You’ve received a gift,

1144
01:11:23,730 --> 01:11:25,660
so you should buy me one.

1145
01:11:25,660 --> 01:11:26,950
So the target isn’t Han Gye-jeol. It’s me.
