00:00:26,540 --> 00:00:27,840
(Episode 15)

2
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,720
I killed a god

3
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,950
I killed a god.

4
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:46,480
Just like that, you...

5
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:50,420
You became a murderer.

6
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:23,110
Deity.

7
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,539
Deity.

8
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:34,240
Deity.

9
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,290
Deity.

10
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:42,010
Deity.

11
00:02:42,520 --> 00:02:44,350
Deity, wake up!

12
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:46,670
Deity, wake up!

13
00:02:48,329 --> 00:02:49,400
Deity.

14
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:52,970
Deity, wake up!

15
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,540
Deity, breathe!

16
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,460
Deity!

17
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,710
Deity, wake up!

18
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:08,320
Deity!

19
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,090
No!

20
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,660
Deity, please.

21
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,250
Please, wake up.

22
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:21,810
Deity, wake up!

23
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:25,740
Lord O Hyeon!

24
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:32,050
Lord O Hyeon!

25
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:38,460
Lord O Hyeon!

26
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,220
Lord O Hyeon! O Hyeon!

27
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:50,180
Lord O Hyeon…

28
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,660
In the end…

29
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:31,930
It's still you…

30
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,300
I was defending myself.

31
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,230
Because Do Jin-woo burst in...

32
00:04:38,230 --> 00:04:39,530
It doesn't matter.

33
00:04:43,030 --> 00:04:47,470
I killed you, and killed myself.

34
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,940
I deserve to be punished

35
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:54,090
by drifting in the world forever.

36
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,460
But when in this way, it's not a punishment but a reward.

37
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:05,030
The 10,000 times of resurrection

38
00:05:07,190 --> 00:05:10,030
are also 10,000 chances to take revenge.

39
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:15,780
Who are you?

40
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:17,690
Who are you?

41
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,160
Seol Hui.

42
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:27,090
Seol Hui?

43
00:05:31,010 --> 00:05:31,800
Seol Hui

44
00:06:02,640 --> 00:06:03,350
Deity.

45
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,910
Deity.

46
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:10,900
Deity.

47
00:06:12,340 --> 00:06:13,450
Wake up!

48
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:10,440
Seol Hui,

49
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:14,400
the joy of spring that blooms even in the snow.

50
00:07:23,870 --> 00:07:25,870
You are the spring that redeems me,

51
00:07:39,930 --> 00:07:42,550
but I am the winter that killed you.

52
00:07:57,830 --> 00:07:59,070
When you wake up,

53
00:08:01,510 --> 00:08:03,330
will you tell me what you dreamed?

54
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:07,710
How can I forget you?

55
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:13,240
I have a lot to say, too. Please come back soon.

56
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,980
Didn't you say that my words have the power to save or kill people?

57
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:24,850
Gods don't lie to humans, right?

58
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,490
The one who can't bloom again because of me...

59
00:08:35,270 --> 00:08:36,610
Come back, Deity.

60
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,240
Please come back.

61
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:46,180
The spring.

62
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:42,840
Brother-in-law

63
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:44,720
Hello?

64
00:09:46,180 --> 00:09:47,290
Brother-in-law.

65
00:09:48,310 --> 00:09:49,010
Really?

66
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:51,790
Brother-in-law.

67
00:09:52,950 --> 00:09:53,770
What's going on?

68
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:55,970
Is brother-in-law dead or alive?

69
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:58,460
Didn't you say the gates of the underworld would open last night?

70
00:09:58,460 --> 00:09:59,410
It hasn't opened yet?

71
00:10:00,280 --> 00:10:02,920
It's not a train, can it be late too?

72
00:10:04,350 --> 00:10:07,960
I don't want you to go back.

73
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:10,510
But is it murder or attempted murder?

74
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:11,960
Something's wrong with the plan.

75
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:15,120
In the end, you expected it or have a plan B?

76
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,140
Tell me this before you go.

77
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:17,670
Brother-in-law.

78
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:18,880
What plan?

79
00:10:26,820 --> 00:10:28,490
Which one did you hear from?

80
00:10:29,030 --> 00:10:30,050
The door to the underworld will be open.

81
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,260
You've heard it all. Give me a break.

82
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,670
If you don't want the gate of the underworld to be opened, tell me now.

83
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,670
He told you to catch Kim Pil-soo after his death?

84
00:10:48,990 --> 00:10:50,740
What kind of nonsense is that?

85
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:52,550
He’s going back anyway.

86
00:10:52,970 --> 00:10:54,020
So when he goes back, just by the way...

87
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,750
That too.

88
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:56,610
Is he going back,

89
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:57,980
when and how to go back,

90
00:10:57,980 --> 00:10:59,380
why do only you guys know about that kind of thing?

91
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:01,260
I was the one who got broken up with.

92
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:02,420
But why am I the only one who doesn't know?

93
00:11:03,810 --> 00:11:05,300
Even if we have broken up, you have to maintain basic manners, right?

94
00:11:05,790 --> 00:11:07,160
How can you do that?

95
00:11:11,860 --> 00:11:13,800
He said he wanted you to hate him.

96
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:15,790
You can't see each other again anyway.

97
00:11:15,790 --> 00:11:17,610
He’s afraid you'll be unhappy because you’ll miss him.

98
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:19,970
Whether I'll be happy or not, I'll take care of it myself.

99
00:11:19,970 --> 00:11:22,310
Why should he presume to plan it for me?

100
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:25,280
Do you know what I almost did,

101
00:11:25,280 --> 00:11:27,390
just because you two lied to me?

102
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:31,790
It's your wish to go to the underworld, isn't it?

103
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:33,290
What's so hard about it?

104
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:35,170
I'll send you there myself.

105
00:11:36,380 --> 00:11:37,390
I know what we did was stupid.

106
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:38,520
But think about it.

107
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,960
You’ll be parting soon.

108
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:41,410
You’re never going to see each other again.

109
00:11:41,410 --> 00:11:42,830
If it were you, would you be able to keep your sanity?

110
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:50,740
That's why I like my brother-in-law even more.

111
00:11:52,460 --> 00:11:53,490
Because he's as stupid as I am.

112
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:02,920
How dare you say that? How dare you?

113
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:08,610
Don't you dare wake up, you idiot!

114
00:12:10,210 --> 00:12:11,540
I won't let you go easily.

115
00:12:25,230 --> 00:12:27,130
In that case, he should be detained, right?

116
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:29,040
You’ve already been punished.

117
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:30,910
Why do you always have to make a big deal out of it?

118
00:12:34,150 --> 00:12:34,810
Quick news.

119
00:12:34,810 --> 00:12:37,820
Speaker Kim Pil-soo of Pilseong Bio was transferred to the prosecution on suspicion of attempted murder.

120
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:39,350
He was handed over to the prosecution.

121
00:12:39,940 --> 00:12:42,150
(Pilseong Bio Speaker Kim Pil-soo was handed over to the prosecution on suspicion of attempted murder.)
He is suspected of using a weapon to cause a coma

122
00:12:42,150 --> 00:12:47,280
to the former Chief of Planning Office of Pilseong Hospital, Mr. Do,
(Pilseong Bio Speaker Kim Pil-soo was handed over to the prosecution on suspicion of attempted murder.)

123
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,700
-at around 9pm on the 18th. -Your flowers are ready.

124
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,540
The police arrested Mr. Kim as a flagrant offender.

125
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:55,780
They are investigating the case.

126
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,710
Hello, Seol Hui.

127
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:53,280
Once upon a time, I walked along this road of red flowers.

128
00:13:55,690 --> 00:13:58,870
I didn't know that it was my last chance to see the one I loved.

129
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:03,160
So I couldn't say goodbye to him.

130
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:07,000
I couldn't make up my mind to live a good life.

131
00:14:09,470 --> 00:14:13,040
That long-ago greeting, till now...

132
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,880
Hello, Lord O Hyeon.

133
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:08,000
Why are you crying?

134
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,440
Because I'm happy.

135
00:16:12,950 --> 00:16:14,750
Happy? Why are you happy?

136
00:16:14,750 --> 00:16:17,230
It's because I think love is really something great.

137
00:16:19,270 --> 00:16:21,440
Even if you wait for a thousand years, you don't feel sorry.

138
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,700
And even after a thousand years, it still feels like yesterday.

139
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,100
What else is there besides love?

140
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:28,980
I've really lived in vain.

141
00:16:29,540 --> 00:16:31,260
I've never even had such a beautiful love.

142
00:16:33,890 --> 00:16:34,760
You didn't live in vain.

143
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:37,720
It's good to start a relationship now!

144
00:16:38,390 --> 00:16:39,890
You have a long life ahead of you.

145
00:16:40,810 --> 00:16:42,700
What's the use of long days

146
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,280
with no decent guy?

147
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:45,340
Why not?

148
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,090
Where is it?

149
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:47,350
Here, I...

150
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:49,010
Are you crazy?

151
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:49,870
Yeah, I'm crazy.

152
00:16:50,490 --> 00:16:52,120
I'm going crazy with curiosity.

153
00:16:52,120 --> 00:16:53,500
What are you curious about?

154
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:54,670
The first kiss.

155
00:16:55,130 --> 00:16:56,100
You bastard!

156
00:17:06,849 --> 00:17:08,190
Are you worried about me or are you hiding something personal?

157
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,369
What?

158
00:17:10,190 --> 00:17:12,920
I said it's fine, but you must have a personal reason.

159
00:17:14,260 --> 00:17:18,060
It's a fact that you fainted. Stop talking nonsense and lean on me.

160
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:20,230
Then I'll lean on you.

161
00:17:34,180 --> 00:17:35,410
I'm horny.

162
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:41,960
What's the point of being horny? Your body isn't normal either.

163
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:45,170
Yes, how can it be normal?

164
00:17:46,040 --> 00:17:47,820
For a normal man, it's poison.

165
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:48,980
But for me, it's a cure.

166
00:17:49,710 --> 00:17:50,350
What do you think?

167
00:17:51,230 --> 00:17:53,530
Do you want to see the power of a thousand-year-old demon?

168
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:02,940
Nope.

169
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:05,490
I'm in the middle of seeing something exciting.

170
00:18:05,490 --> 00:18:06,110
Why are you interrupting?

171
00:18:06,110 --> 00:18:06,900
I can't stand anymore.

172
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:09,680
Damn it!

173
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:10,630
What are you doing?

174
00:18:12,680 --> 00:18:13,970
Don't get me wrong.

175
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:17,590
We just want to learn from our seniors who are progressing fast.

176
00:18:17,590 --> 00:18:20,520
But the foundation is so poor that there is nothing to learn.

177
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:22,040
What's wrong with the basics? What's the difference?

178
00:18:22,040 --> 00:18:23,290
This is already a textbook version.

179
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:24,730
A textbook?

180
00:18:24,730 --> 00:18:27,620
Do you know the best textbook in this field Village Talks?

181
00:18:27,620 --> 00:18:29,800
It says that

182
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:31,450
before coveting someone else's body,

183
00:18:31,450 --> 00:18:32,610
you have to wash your own body first.

184
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:34,770
How can you covet other people's bodies directly?

185
00:18:34,770 --> 00:18:36,860
You only read textbooks like this to behave like this.

186
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:40,240
I... I... I'm going upstairs.

187
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:41,140
Let's go together.

188
00:18:42,280 --> 00:18:43,780
You should get a good rest tonight.

189
00:18:43,780 --> 00:18:45,560
Don't come with me.

190
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:46,780
You've been resting for a thousand years.

191
00:18:48,990 --> 00:18:50,390
He said he's been resting for 1,000 years

192
00:18:50,390 --> 00:18:51,520
You guys…

193
00:18:56,060 --> 00:18:58,210
If you try to get involved once more,

194
00:18:58,210 --> 00:19:01,110
it's not just popcorn, you'll fly into the sky.

195
00:19:03,720 --> 00:19:05,880
Han Gye-jeol. Han Gye-jeol.

196
00:19:06,890 --> 00:19:07,920
Keep going!

197
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,360
See?

198
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:22,280
Lord Deity’s temper and bad habits haven't changed at all.

199
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:25,130
Even if he didn’t return to the underworld, don't worry.

200
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:27,870
Don't worry.

201
00:19:29,090 --> 00:19:30,570
Of course he has changed!

202
00:19:31,810 --> 00:19:32,950
What has changed?

203
00:19:34,070 --> 00:19:36,370
Han Gye-jeol didn't let him follow her anymore,

204
00:19:36,370 --> 00:19:37,430
but he still followed.

205
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:42,300
From now on, the order will never work again.

206
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,000
Deity.

207
00:20:15,030 --> 00:20:17,930
Deity, are you awake? Let's go for a walk.

208
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,930
Deity? Deity, are you still sleeping?

209
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:26,880
What time is it? Still sleeping?

210
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:31,010
I'm getting in.

211
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:34,470
I clearly said I'm getting in.

212
00:20:40,620 --> 00:20:43,410
Deity! Deity!

213
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,100
Deity

214
00:20:50,390 --> 00:20:52,190
Deity! Deity!

215
00:20:52,190 --> 00:20:53,080
Not there.

216
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:03,780
You scared me.

217
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:06,300
What? Afraid I'd leave?

218
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,880
Just because I didn't say hello, I waited a thousand years.

219
00:21:09,980 --> 00:21:11,370
Would I do something like that again?

220
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:15,290
What's that?

221
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:19,330
It blooms in the early spring in the south.

222
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:21,810
Because I am a god who comes in summer and leaves in winter.

223
00:21:21,810 --> 00:21:23,520
I have never had a spring in my season.

224
00:21:24,730 --> 00:21:27,210
I've never regretted not having spring.

225
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:29,120
But after seeing you, I feel sorry now.

226
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:33,900
I want to walk with you together in spring.

227
00:21:33,900 --> 00:21:35,340
Just like a thousand years ago.

228
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,790
We should just wait together.

229
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:48,630
Really?

230
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:54,670
Where did you go to in the south to see such beautiful purple flowers?

231
00:21:54,670 --> 00:21:55,430
Australia?

232
00:21:56,910 --> 00:22:00,070
Australia? Australia? There?

233
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:08,080
I think it's the flower market in Yangjae-dong.

234
00:22:10,390 --> 00:22:13,950
You always seem to forget who you're dating.

235
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:30,700
Is it Australia?

236
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:32,220
It's so cold.

237
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,770
Could it be a country where it's springtime?

238
00:22:37,310 --> 00:22:40,270
It's Italy, Milan, right?

239
00:22:45,030 --> 00:22:47,120
Look at this beautiful plaque.

240
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,310
Verona, Florence.

241
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,520
How can it be just one building away from each other?

242
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,030
Is this...

243
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:03,680
That's right, the color, the air, it's Gapyeong.

244
00:23:06,920 --> 00:23:09,460
Why do you use the instant movement when going to Gapyeong?

245
00:23:09,460 --> 00:23:11,300
How much does it cost to drive to Gapyeong?

246
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,660
You have to save to live a good life.

247
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:14,460
If you go to Italy, you'll save money on airfare.

248
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:15,670
Haven't you thought about it?

249
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:16,910
What's the use of saving money on airfare?

250
00:23:16,910 --> 00:23:18,630
Don’t you eat, don’t you play, don’t you sleep?

251
00:23:18,630 --> 00:23:21,110
Do you know how high the exchange rate is these days?

252
00:23:21,110 --> 00:23:22,580
You seem to feel a deep sigh,

253
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:24,380
but you cannot feel the high exchange rate.

254
00:23:24,380 --> 00:23:26,710
I can't feel it because I've never been there.

255
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:29,500
Really?

256
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:37,060
Then go there for real.

257
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:40,580
Forget it.

258
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:44,500
I have confirmed that your ability is as same as ever.

259
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:46,810
I'm satisfied with that.

260
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:49,600
My other abilities are also the same. Why don't you confirm them?

261
00:23:51,310 --> 00:23:54,640
Every time you’re bragging, so annoying.

262
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:58,250
You're blaspheming.

263
00:23:58,250 --> 00:24:00,750
I'm the god of action.

264
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:02,810
You're always bragging.

265
00:24:03,610 --> 00:24:04,480
Wait.

266
00:24:04,480 --> 00:24:06,210
Thank you.

267
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,220
Is this yours?

268
00:24:14,860 --> 00:24:16,710
I thought these two are all for one person.

269
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:19,620
Come on, one, two, three.

270
00:24:21,290 --> 00:24:22,850
Great.

271
00:24:22,850 --> 00:24:25,130
What are you doing? Get away from it.

272
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,180
Or I'll smash it up.

273
00:24:26,180 --> 00:24:27,970
Deity, come and take pictures with me.

274
00:24:27,970 --> 00:24:29,080
Come on, hurry up.

275
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:29,780
Together?

276
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,760
Okay.

277
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:32,890
Selfie! Selfie!

278
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:33,810
Come on.

279
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:39,990
More pictures?

280
00:24:39,990 --> 00:24:42,310
One, two, three.

281
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,410
Deity,

282
00:24:59,410 --> 00:25:01,370
look, isn't it so cute?

283
00:25:03,310 --> 00:25:04,330
Deity,

284
00:25:05,680 --> 00:25:06,700
are you uncomfortable?

285
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:10,390
So cold.

286
00:25:13,110 --> 00:25:14,850
I thought I was going to freeze to death.

287
00:25:16,940 --> 00:25:18,360
You're exaggerating.

288
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,460
How long are you going to be like this? Let go of me.

289
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:30,030
No.

290
00:25:30,030 --> 00:25:33,210
I've waited for a thousand years. Can't you even do that?

291
00:25:33,210 --> 00:25:38,570
I have my excuse. I have to go to the bathroom...

292
00:25:38,570 --> 00:25:40,330
No, time is too precious.

293
00:25:40,330 --> 00:25:42,420
Hold on, go to it later.

294
00:25:44,660 --> 00:25:47,150
Clingy men aren't my type.

295
00:25:47,150 --> 00:25:48,670
You don't like the clingy type?

296
00:25:48,670 --> 00:25:53,220
How about sticky men?

297
00:25:54,910 --> 00:25:57,110
It's like a bad move.

298
00:25:57,110 --> 00:25:59,410
A bad move? No.

299
00:25:59,410 --> 00:26:01,240
Han Gye-jeol’s ideal type has appeared.

300
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,850
It's even not enough for me to perform well.

301
00:26:02,850 --> 00:26:04,710
Ideal type? Where?

302
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,720
Where?

303
00:26:11,130 --> 00:26:14,960
The Pinocchio that turns into a human from a wooden monster?

304
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,150
Your ideal type is a human, not a monster.

305
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,280
You said before that a human would be fine.

306
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:21,300
But I can't even meet that requirement.

307
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:23,880
I need to become a human as soon as possible.

308
00:26:23,880 --> 00:26:25,810
Only then will Han Gye-jeol like me.

309
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:28,800
You really hold a grudge.

310
00:26:30,300 --> 00:26:31,980
If I didn't hold a grudge,

311
00:26:31,980 --> 00:26:33,710
would I have survived the millennium?

312
00:26:33,710 --> 00:26:35,570
If that's your wish,

313
00:26:35,570 --> 00:26:37,440
try looking for the green elves.

314
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:38,510
Elves?

315
00:26:38,510 --> 00:26:41,390
There are elves that turn Pinocchio into a human.

316
00:26:44,550 --> 00:26:46,510
Why look so far away?

317
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:48,260
There's an elf right in front of me.

318
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:54,650
What? What a good taste!

319
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:59,930
Make sure to turn me into a human, we’ve made the deal.

320
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:14,640
Even the Green Elf said

321
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:19,430
he couldn't turn Pinocchio into a human until after he died.

322
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:26,500
So, Deity, go back to the underworld.

323
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,780
If we are lucky enough to meet again in the distant future,

324
00:27:32,550 --> 00:27:35,920
I will definitely turn you into a human at that time.

325
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:38,250
I won't leaving.

326
00:27:38,250 --> 00:27:39,170
Why?

327
00:27:41,790 --> 00:27:45,370
Did the door to the underworld that was previously open get closed?

328
00:27:45,370 --> 00:27:47,690
Didn't you say you were a master in the underworld?

329
00:27:47,690 --> 00:27:50,390
It's just a door, you can open it, right?

330
00:27:50,390 --> 00:27:54,360
I can’t. Only the Creator can open it.

331
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,220
Then you should have gone back then.

332
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:57,340
Why did you come back?

333
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:01,430
Because of me again?

334
00:28:07,080 --> 00:28:08,300
It's not your fault.

335
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:15,790
I didn't even know if you were there.

336
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:20,640
The moment the door of the underworld open, the images of this world will disappear.

337
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:23,920
The road where life and death meet is near but far.

338
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:27,320
So I can't hear or see anything even if you’re around.

339
00:28:30,690 --> 00:28:34,250
Please, wake up, O Hyeon!

340
00:28:37,010 --> 00:28:39,480
It was the first time in a thousand years

341
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,470
that someone called me by my name.

342
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,680
That's when I knew

343
00:28:45,680 --> 00:28:48,360
God had granted my long-held wish.

344
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,200
What was your wish?

345
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:56,760
Someone can recognize me,

346
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,240
someone can call me by my name.

347
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:04,270
Whether it's love, revenge, or regret, whatever it is,

348
00:29:04,270 --> 00:29:07,260
just don't forget me.

349
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,730
Wait for someone who has no memory.

350
00:29:11,730 --> 00:29:14,400
Just as I am looking forward to someone's arrival,

351
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:18,150
I hope that I am also the existence that someone expects.

352
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:26,370
As a result, you recognized me as O Hyeon.

353
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:31,440
Now it's time for me to fulfill God's wish.

354
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,880
Until that woman says she loves you like this,

355
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:38,650
your cursed life will end and you will be at peace forever.

356
00:29:39,770 --> 00:29:42,670
I stay because I still have something to settle with God.

357
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,860
It has nothing to do with you.

358
00:29:45,860 --> 00:29:47,700
There is no problem.

359
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,080
So don't worry.

360
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:51,320
Is there really no problem?

361
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,450
The god of the underworld says to stay here.

362
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,750
Even if there are problems, I can solve them.

363
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:10,510
Trust me.

364
00:30:33,090 --> 00:30:34,840
Would you like to have a cup of tea together?

365
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,740
I'll make it and go to your room.

366
00:30:36,740 --> 00:30:37,730
No.

367
00:30:37,730 --> 00:30:38,420
What?

368
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,590
I'm an ancient man.

369
00:30:40,590 --> 00:30:43,910
I don't tolerate unmarried men and women meeting in private at night.

370
00:30:43,910 --> 00:30:47,870
So don't go into my room at night.

371
00:30:54,400 --> 00:30:56,370
You say you're the god of action, bullshit!

372
00:31:04,430 --> 00:31:05,940
Go to hell!

373
00:31:08,690 --> 00:31:09,930
Go to hell!

374
00:31:11,530 --> 00:31:12,300
Go to hell!

375
00:31:27,410 --> 00:31:31,300
Even if we are disciplined, we still can't rest.

376
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:33,210
What can we do?

377
00:31:33,210 --> 00:31:35,830
The prosecutor said he could only trust me.

378
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:42,870
There were three staff members who hung the plaque that day.

379
00:31:42,870 --> 00:31:45,790
But after the accident, the court couldn't find them anywhere.

380
00:31:45,790 --> 00:31:49,190
The prosecutor said he'll send me the phone records of those people.

381
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:53,490
After investigation, we may be able to track down Kim Pil-soo or his men.

382
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:55,370
Do you think we can catch that great Kim Pil-soo

383
00:31:55,370 --> 00:31:59,770
with something like this?

384
00:31:59,770 --> 00:32:02,970
It's said that drops of water will penetrate a stone one day.

385
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:05,910
All these little things will finish him off.

386
00:32:05,910 --> 00:32:09,240
Wow, do you know what this drip is?

387
00:32:11,860 --> 00:32:13,490
A Ri-su?

388
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:14,600
Go away!

389
00:32:21,670 --> 00:32:21,830
(Han Chul, are you busy today too?)

390
00:32:21,830 --> 00:32:23,280
Han Chul, are you busy today too?
(Han Chul, are you busy today too?)

391
00:32:23,280 --> 00:32:24,830
Han Chul, are you busy today too?

392
00:32:29,870 --> 00:32:30,420
(Yes, I'm working late.)

393
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,070
Yes, I'm working late.
(Yes, I'm working late.)

394
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:33,710
(Yes, I'm working late.)

395
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:40,960
Yes or no, you have to make a decision.

396
00:32:42,020 --> 00:32:43,630
Don't torture her.

397
00:32:44,700 --> 00:32:46,290
Of course.

398
00:32:46,290 --> 00:32:48,520
Yes or no,

399
00:32:48,520 --> 00:32:51,120
I need to come to a conclusion with my family first,

400
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:53,050
so that my woman won't suffer a lot.

401
00:32:55,900 --> 00:32:59,190
I know I can't defend myself right now.

402
00:32:59,190 --> 00:33:02,480
Bad Han Chul, how can he not contact you first?

403
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,490
Hey, the man who doesn't like you,

404
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:05,610
let him go away.

405
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:07,820
He didn't say he didn't like me.

406
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:10,060
Are you a fool? You don't know until he tells you?

407
00:33:10,060 --> 00:33:10,840
He must say it so I can know.

408
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,960
Otherwise, how can I know what he's thinking inside?

409
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:17,120
So are you going to be the ashamed one to ask him yourself?

410
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:21,860
Yes, I'm going to ask him if he likes me or not, and then I'm going to pester him.

411
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:26,170
What's so embarrassing about it? Why don't I try harder after seeing each other for so long?

412
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:27,540
You're crazy.

413
00:33:27,540 --> 00:33:30,520
If I’m not crazy, then it's not true love.

414
00:33:39,570 --> 00:33:42,080
Great. That's what trying is all about.

415
00:33:43,790 --> 00:33:47,580
Sister, I have her in my heart.

416
00:33:49,770 --> 00:33:52,600
Sister, I'm sorry. I'm a man who can't help it.

417
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:54,030
I'm so sad.

418
00:33:54,030 --> 00:33:57,320
It's not a sin to fall in love.

419
00:34:00,770 --> 00:34:02,140
It's a sin.

420
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:08,179
What's going on here?

421
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,960
Is it incest? With the last high-heeled shoe owner?

422
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:14,120
Are you crazy?

423
00:34:14,120 --> 00:34:17,360
Are you in debt? Or are you a guarantor? How much?

424
00:34:17,360 --> 00:34:21,380
I've been through this before, so I know. Over 30 million won, there's no way.

425
00:34:21,380 --> 00:34:24,580
You're really... I don't know what to say.

426
00:34:26,440 --> 00:34:28,989
But she's competent and a doctor.

427
00:34:28,989 --> 00:34:31,900
Doctors are not all capable. Just look at me.

428
00:34:31,900 --> 00:34:33,080
She graduated from Korean University.

429
00:34:34,570 --> 00:34:37,010
Why would a person like that date with you?

430
00:34:37,010 --> 00:34:39,030
Does she need the Han family's beauty genes?

431
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,260
For a better second generation?

432
00:34:40,260 --> 00:34:41,620
She's already too pretty.

433
00:34:41,620 --> 00:34:42,460
She must be a liar.

434
00:34:42,460 --> 00:34:43,530
A liar.

435
00:34:45,850 --> 00:34:51,040
I know the market here too well. Graduated from Korean University, a beauty,

436
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,949
who’s not in debt and unmarried. There is no such person in reality.

437
00:34:54,949 --> 00:34:55,810
But I met one.

438
00:34:55,810 --> 00:34:58,060
There's only one doctor like that I know.

439
00:34:58,060 --> 00:34:59,650
So...

440
00:34:59,650 --> 00:35:00,900
What do you mean?

441
00:35:00,900 --> 00:35:03,720
That's the one, Tae Jeong-won.

442
00:35:11,490 --> 00:35:13,270
The one who made you hurt and bleed?

443
00:35:14,420 --> 00:35:17,150
The one who made me cry?

444
00:35:17,150 --> 00:35:18,360
You mean that Tae Jeong-won?

445
00:35:20,450 --> 00:35:23,030
But you should try harder.

446
00:35:23,030 --> 00:35:29,810
No matter what I do, just once, please let it go, okay?

447
00:35:29,810 --> 00:35:30,910
No wonder.

448
00:35:33,610 --> 00:35:36,090
She doesn't do anything so easily.

449
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,250
I know you two have a problem.

450
00:35:41,250 --> 00:35:44,620
You may have misunderstood. It’s not a problem.

451
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,880
It's only a problem if there's a solution.

452
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:51,040
It's only a problem if there's a possibility.

453
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:54,690
There's no solution between her and me.

454
00:35:54,690 --> 00:35:56,950
I'll try and we'll try together.

455
00:35:56,950 --> 00:35:58,570
Sister, please forgive her this time.

456
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,660
I can forgive her. I can forgive her as a friend from the past.

457
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:04,320
I can also forgive her as a current colleague.

458
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:08,540
But I can't forgive her as a future family member.

459
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:12,180
I don't know how much you know.

460
00:36:12,180 --> 00:36:14,530
She betrayed me as a friend.

461
00:36:15,700 --> 00:36:18,850
Someone once said that betrayal is a habit.

462
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:21,440
I can't bear that even you will be betrayed and cry.

463
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:22,530
Maybe it's prejudice.

464
00:36:22,530 --> 00:36:26,250
That's my experience! The experience of a scab of pain!

465
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,870
The experience whenever I see the scab, my pain comes back!

466
00:36:32,700 --> 00:36:35,690
I'm sorry, sister.

467
00:36:35,690 --> 00:36:36,820
Why are you sorry?

468
00:36:38,920 --> 00:36:41,010
Because you can't break up despite that?

469
00:36:42,590 --> 00:36:47,060
Don't worry, I won't force you to break up.

470
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:50,300
But don't ask me for permission either.

471
00:36:52,350 --> 00:36:55,070
Sister! Sister! Wait!

472
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:02,530
Han Gye-jeol, Gye-jeol, I'm sorry.

473
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:07,240
I'm really sorry. No.

474
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:10,450
No, I'm not even qualified to say such things.

475
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,030
I'm really a bad woman.

476
00:37:17,670 --> 00:37:19,490
Did you drink?

477
00:37:19,490 --> 00:37:23,930
Yes, I drank a lot.

478
00:37:23,930 --> 00:37:25,670
Come back when you're sober.

479
00:37:25,670 --> 00:37:26,770
Let’s talk when you're sober.

480
00:37:26,770 --> 00:37:30,500
When I am sober? I'm sober now.

481
00:37:31,600 --> 00:37:37,580
You know that I'm crazy every day.

482
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,510
Pretty crazy.

483
00:37:44,540 --> 00:37:47,070
So I did that to you.

484
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:52,270
Hey, stop it. Whatever it is, don't say it.

485
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:54,290
What are you doing in front of my brother? Are you crazy?

486
00:37:54,290 --> 00:37:57,510
Yeah, I'm really crazy.

487
00:37:58,870 --> 00:38:03,820
I heard that the man was out of prison. I was afraid he'll come to me.

488
00:38:03,820 --> 00:38:06,590
I was afraid of getting beaten up again. I was going crazy.

489
00:38:08,350 --> 00:38:10,450
I wanted to leave Korea

490
00:38:12,690 --> 00:38:15,570
to a place where no one knows me.

491
00:38:17,560 --> 00:38:19,310
What's she talking about?

492
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:25,600
But Jeong I-deun offered me to be his team doctor and go to America with him,

493
00:38:25,600 --> 00:38:28,380
as long as I help him break up with you.

494
00:38:28,380 --> 00:38:32,670
So I knew it wasn't right, but I did it anyway.

495
00:38:37,230 --> 00:38:38,820
To get away.

496
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:43,340
I'm really sorry. I'm really...

497
00:38:45,260 --> 00:38:47,020
I'm really sorry.

498
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:55,350
That's a lot of tricks.

499
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,750
Sister, I'm not being biased, she also has her reasons...

500
00:39:02,750 --> 00:39:04,350
That's all for today.

501
00:39:04,350 --> 00:39:06,640
I don't want to hear any more from you or anyone else.

502
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:09,490
Listen to him.

503
00:39:10,860 --> 00:39:12,290
-Jeong-won, wait. -It's okay.

504
00:39:14,910 --> 00:39:18,950
Who are you to disobey our Chul?

505
00:39:18,950 --> 00:39:21,290
Who are you?

506
00:39:21,290 --> 00:39:22,370
Let go.

507
00:39:22,370 --> 00:39:24,550
You want to fight?

508
00:39:25,530 --> 00:39:26,630
Why are you also following?

509
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:27,650
You really...

510
00:39:42,950 --> 00:39:46,170
Only pulled my hair, right?

511
00:39:46,170 --> 00:39:49,010
Han Chul, I’ll kill you.

512
00:39:54,290 --> 00:39:58,240
Tell me, it's my specialty to kill people.

513
00:39:58,240 --> 00:40:01,420
Forget it, get out.

514
00:40:02,630 --> 00:40:04,980
I see something so interesting, why should I go out?

515
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,180
No, it's already late and you're still barging in like this.

516
00:40:09,180 --> 00:40:12,730
Who forbade unmarried couples from meeting at night?

517
00:40:13,740 --> 00:40:16,210
I guess we're already married, aren't we?

518
00:40:16,210 --> 00:40:18,060
Shall we get married if we need to?

519
00:40:18,060 --> 00:40:20,230
If it's a joke, it's not funny.

520
00:40:20,230 --> 00:40:22,080
If it's a confession, it's not touching.

521
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,000
If you say so, you're too cheeky.

522
00:40:24,000 --> 00:40:28,160
I've given you much happiness and touching, you can build 10 TV stations with them.

523
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:32,400
So are you going to charge me TV fees?

524
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:34,740
That's good. TV fees.

525
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:38,140
Considering that I've prepared thousand years for this 100-days public performances.

526
00:40:41,870 --> 00:40:45,600
At least I have to charge these.

527
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,820
(Protection contract)

528
00:40:47,820 --> 00:40:52,050
The contract? Why do you take this out?

529
00:40:52,050 --> 00:40:53,630
Let's amend it.

530
00:40:53,630 --> 00:40:56,240
You might as well just ask me for money.

531
00:40:56,240 --> 00:40:58,090
Don’t make unreasonable demands.

532
00:41:01,300 --> 00:41:09,090
(Protection contract)

533
00:41:09,090 --> 00:41:11,660
(Article 1: Don't say I love you. Article 2: Never date other guys.)

534
00:41:13,960 --> 00:41:15,390
Say you love me.

535
00:41:16,870 --> 00:41:18,870
So suddenly?

536
00:41:18,870 --> 00:41:25,240
But only when I need it, I have to be mentally prepared.

537
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:27,590
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

538
00:41:30,080 --> 00:41:33,690
Didn’t you say that a man’s Confession means from the end to the end?

539
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:36,380
It means he doesn’t want to work hard during the process?

540
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:43,570
Didn’t you say you wanted to see flowers and get wet on the way, and enjoy every moment?

541
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:54,040
It’s time to end it now that I’ve had enough.

542
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:57,440
End it?

543
00:42:01,020 --> 00:42:03,600
Where there’s an end, there’s a beginning, right?

544
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:07,350
It’s only when we see each other and part that the longing begins.

545
00:42:07,350 --> 00:42:10,060
Only when the flowers wither will they bear fruit.

546
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:13,530
Only when winter is over will spring come.

547
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:19,050
Because I didn’t let go for a long time, this season is always winter.

548
00:42:21,370 --> 00:42:24,150
You mean it’s cold and lonely.

549
00:42:26,210 --> 00:42:29,720
So you want to end the relationship and marry me?

550
00:42:32,730 --> 00:42:35,570
You don’t have to ask me that blatantly.

551
00:42:35,570 --> 00:42:38,900
I don’t understand the roundabout because I was a science student.

552
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,960
Are you sure it’s because of that?

553
00:42:40,960 --> 00:42:44,180
What’s wrong with that? I was a literary girl.

554
00:42:44,180 --> 00:42:47,910
When was it? A thousand years ago, you just used force directly.

555
00:42:47,910 --> 00:42:53,200
Wait and see, I’ll prepare a confession that will bring tears to your eyes.

556
00:42:56,710 --> 00:42:57,870
I’m looking forward to it.

557
00:43:15,170 --> 00:43:17,540
(I'm really sorry if you have a girlfriend... But if you don't mind, I hope you can contact me! Aloe Vera Drink You're so handsome! Drink this to cheer up~)

558
00:43:17,540 --> 00:43:19,140
(A gift-like meal for health)

559
00:43:19,140 --> 00:43:19,620
Healthy diet as a gift.
(A gift-like meal for health)

560
00:43:19,620 --> 00:43:22,360
Healthy diet as a gift.

561
00:43:35,300 --> 00:43:38,940
Hello, may I sit here?

562
00:43:44,130 --> 00:43:47,700
Why do you ask him? I’m the owner of this seat.

563
00:43:58,090 --> 00:43:59,330
("Master" and "Companion" are homophones in Korean.)
My old partner.

564
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:00,930
("Master" and "Companion" are homophones in Korean.)

565
00:44:00,930 --> 00:44:03,510
What? It sounds like a grandpa.
("Master" and "Companion" are homophones in Korean.)

566
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:06,060
What’s wrong? It’s like a couple who have lived together for 500 years.

567
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,140
Isn’t it good, my old partner?

568
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:14,020
I’m not a grandmother, I’m a girl, a literary girl.

569
00:44:28,470 --> 00:44:34,320
You’re really a magical girl who falls asleep when reads a book.

570
00:44:43,510 --> 00:44:50,250
(Don't believe in luck too much. The culprit is all you.)

571
00:45:30,850 --> 00:45:32,940
(A gift of luck, all of you.)

572
00:45:32,940 --> 00:45:35,220
A gift and fortune. It’s all about you.
(A gift of luck, all of you.)

573
00:45:35,220 --> 00:45:36,820
A gift and fortune. It’s all about you.

574
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:09,860
Lord Deity.

575
00:46:09,860 --> 00:46:11,170
-Lord Deity. -Lord Deity, you can’t go out now.

576
00:46:11,170 --> 00:46:13,990
I’m gonna kill him, kill all!

577
00:46:27,010 --> 00:46:28,240
Deity.

578
00:46:31,700 --> 00:46:33,130
Deity.

579
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,240
Deity, what’s wrong with you?

580
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:37,640
Look at me.

581
00:46:37,640 --> 00:46:38,540
Look at me.

582
00:46:38,540 --> 00:46:40,700
Noisy. Get the hell out of here.

583
00:46:42,640 --> 00:46:44,390
Did you hear something?

584
00:46:44,390 --> 00:46:45,490
Is that why you’re like this?

585
00:46:45,490 --> 00:46:47,250
I said I will kill you.

586
00:46:48,190 --> 00:46:49,430
Lord Deity, it’s not her.

587
00:46:49,430 --> 00:46:51,030
Lord Deity, please.

588
00:46:51,030 --> 00:46:53,950
Get out.

589
00:47:02,420 --> 00:47:06,460
Don’t listen to anything.

590
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,800
Listen only to what I say.

591
00:47:11,990 --> 00:47:13,650
Your orders don’t work anymore.

592
00:47:13,650 --> 00:47:16,170
So please get out.

593
00:47:16,170 --> 00:47:18,050
Lord Deity.

594
00:47:19,260 --> 00:47:22,110
Lord O Hyeon!

595
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:25,280
Lord O Hyeon, please...

596
00:47:35,640 --> 00:47:36,300
Seol Hui.

597
00:47:36,300 --> 00:47:38,660
Yeah, alright.

598
00:47:38,660 --> 00:47:40,710
It’s alright now.

599
00:47:40,710 --> 00:47:47,070
Seol Hui.

600
00:48:10,270 --> 00:48:12,350
Do you still hear something?

601
00:48:18,490 --> 00:48:22,970
At least it’s better during the day.

602
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:29,930
When I was an intern,

603
00:48:29,930 --> 00:48:33,460
I ran into a serious highway accident.

604
00:48:33,460 --> 00:48:35,720
Patients were kept being brought to the hospital.

605
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:38,320
It was just like hell.

606
00:48:38,320 --> 00:48:43,670
People were crying for help, cursing at everyone they saw.

607
00:48:44,690 --> 00:48:48,440
Maybe I just became tired and crazy unconsciously at that time.

608
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,470
When I woke up, I found myself hiding in the bathroom.

609
00:48:54,270 --> 00:48:59,460
I couldn’t even bear the pain for one hour.

610
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,040
But you suffered for a thousand years.

611
00:49:05,410 --> 00:49:08,130
Every day of the thousand years is the same.

612
00:49:08,130 --> 00:49:13,200
You had to hear others’ curses, pain, and sorrow.

613
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,430
You’ve been listening to that sound all your life.

614
00:49:19,910 --> 00:49:22,150
But luckily, I met you.

615
00:49:24,090 --> 00:49:30,800
I got a taste of heaven without complaints or curses.

616
00:49:30,800 --> 00:49:34,240
Now my orders don’t work anymore.

617
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,430
And you can’t go back to the underworld.

618
00:49:38,560 --> 00:49:41,350
What should we do now?

619
00:49:41,350 --> 00:49:43,290
Just keep on living like this?

620
00:49:43,290 --> 00:49:46,190
There’s still a chance to save me.

621
00:49:49,520 --> 00:49:51,440
Tell me that I love you.

622
00:49:53,770 --> 00:49:57,420
Then my life will be peaceful from now on.

623
00:49:57,950 --> 00:50:07,990
Is it God’s wish for you to find peace?

624
00:50:10,490 --> 00:50:13,210
Then I won’t say it.

625
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,610
Why?

626
00:50:14,610 --> 00:50:17,120
Didn’t you say endings designed by God are always tragic?

627
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,590
Didn’t you say God won’t arrange a good ending for us?

628
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:24,020
That kind of peace can’t be good.

629
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:26,080
What on earth is that so-called peace like?

630
00:50:26,080 --> 00:50:27,550
Your death?

631
00:50:27,550 --> 00:50:29,280
Disappear forever?

632
00:50:34,180 --> 00:50:35,280
It seems true.

633
00:50:41,450 --> 00:50:44,140
You died for me.

634
00:50:45,390 --> 00:50:47,990
And are you asking me to kill you myself?

635
00:50:50,430 --> 00:50:53,310
How could you say such a thing to me?

636
00:50:53,310 --> 00:50:55,860
How could you be so cruel? How?

637
00:51:11,800 --> 00:51:13,310
Han Gye-jeol,

638
00:51:15,890 --> 00:51:17,190
look at me.

639
00:51:22,180 --> 00:51:25,060
I’ve been dead for a thousand years.

640
00:51:26,100 --> 00:51:28,200
I am no longer a human being.

641
00:51:31,380 --> 00:51:33,340
I’m just a grudge.

642
00:51:34,920 --> 00:51:38,230
The grudge that wants to love and be loved.

643
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:43,140
You’re just saving me from that.

644
00:51:43,140 --> 00:51:48,020
You’re not gonna kill me, but make me live forever.

645
00:51:48,020 --> 00:51:50,140
I can’t do it.

646
00:51:51,620 --> 00:51:58,030
So if you want to be saved, find another way.

647
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:01,820
Prayer or coercion, it’s up to you.

648
00:52:23,610 --> 00:52:25,760
Don’t say anything.

649
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,730
Because I’m not in the mood to hear.

650
00:52:27,730 --> 00:52:33,080
Maybe for you, Lord Deity is your lover.

651
00:52:33,080 --> 00:52:35,340
But for me, he is my family.

652
00:52:37,650 --> 00:52:40,290
As my master, my father and my son,

653
00:52:41,250 --> 00:52:43,410
he has been together with me all his life.

654
00:52:43,410 --> 00:52:49,170
For me, the only person I can trust and rely on is Lord Deity.

655
00:52:49,170 --> 00:52:52,450
Maybe it’s also because of this,

656
00:52:52,450 --> 00:52:58,040
I couldn’t even imagine parting with him.

657
00:53:00,180 --> 00:53:02,580
Even if I feel painful,

658
00:53:02,580 --> 00:53:07,030
but as a family, I can’t dump him at this time.

659
00:53:09,380 --> 00:53:13,570
However, now I don’t think I should continue.

660
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:19,900
Lord Deity has made up his mind not to kill anyone even if he dies.

661
00:53:19,900 --> 00:53:25,000
But once he comes to his senses, he has to kill people.

662
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,910
I couldn’t bear to see him suffer so much.

663
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:37,960
When he’s still conscious,

664
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:41,250
please give him what he wants.

665
00:53:41,250 --> 00:53:47,450
Lord Deity wants to live decently to the last second of his life.

666
00:54:28,390 --> 00:54:30,160
When will he wake up?

667
00:54:30,160 --> 00:54:31,320
Well.

668
00:54:31,320 --> 00:54:33,720
There are no neurological abnormalities.

669
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,650
His brain waves are normal.

670
00:54:35,650 --> 00:54:37,840
But he hasn’t regained consciousness.

671
00:54:37,840 --> 00:54:39,840
We need to keep him under observation for a while.

672
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:43,330
If he wakes up, please contact me immediately.

673
00:54:43,330 --> 00:54:45,230
-Okay. -Thank you.

674
00:55:27,010 --> 00:55:31,640
Sure enough... I’m better than normal doctors.

675
00:55:35,710 --> 00:55:37,360
Let go of me.

676
00:55:37,360 --> 00:55:40,010
Of course I want to let you go.

677
00:55:44,550 --> 00:55:46,690
Because it’s easy to die.

678
00:55:46,690 --> 00:55:49,310
I want you to live to experience hell.

679
00:55:49,310 --> 00:55:52,690
But will Kim Pil-soo let you go?

680
00:55:52,690 --> 00:55:55,270
I’ll definitely kill both the rabbit and the dog.

681
00:55:55,270 --> 00:55:59,720
I’ve caught the rabbit, can I let the hound live?

682
00:56:02,990 --> 00:56:05,490
Do you want me to tell you how to survive?

683
00:56:05,490 --> 00:56:07,830
What kind of tricks are you going to play?

684
00:56:09,790 --> 00:56:14,430
Yeah, bastards should play tricks.

685
00:56:14,430 --> 00:56:17,030
So you have to howl.

686
00:56:17,030 --> 00:56:19,760
Not to the rabbit, but to your master.

687
00:56:21,070 --> 00:56:23,680
Then people will only hunt your master,

688
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:26,000
and throw him at your feet.

689
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:30,880
Are you telling me to turn myself in?

690
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:33,150
Yes.

691
00:56:33,150 --> 00:56:36,650
In that case, whether you go to prison or hell,

692
00:56:36,650 --> 00:56:39,670
take Kim Pil-soo with you.

693
00:56:41,920 --> 00:56:44,200
Only then can you live.

694
00:57:07,810 --> 00:57:10,880
-Wow. -How’s this?

695
00:57:11,920 --> 00:57:15,130
How come you can do everything?

696
00:57:16,790 --> 00:57:20,480
-This is for showing off. -What?

697
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,330
I learned it to show off.

698
00:57:23,330 --> 00:57:25,890
Actually, I can’t make anything else except this.

699
00:57:25,890 --> 00:57:28,400
The dishes and porridge you brought back then...

700
00:57:28,400 --> 00:57:31,950
These... These were actually bought.

701
00:57:31,950 --> 00:57:35,330
The aunt at the grocery store in my neighborhood is good at cooking.

702
00:57:37,880 --> 00:57:40,470
What’s wrong? Disappointed?

703
00:57:40,470 --> 00:57:43,030
I think it’s the aunt at the grocery store who should be disappointed.

704
00:57:43,030 --> 00:57:45,390
Because her regular customer was robbed.

705
00:57:45,390 --> 00:57:48,610
You won’t eat other people’s food if you try mine.

706
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,840
Are you trying to tempt me with food now?

707
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:54,370
I’m going to tempt my sister with food.

708
00:57:54,370 --> 00:57:56,720
If I bring a lunch for her,

709
00:57:56,720 --> 00:57:59,330
considering my sincerity, she’ll cool down.

710
00:58:02,170 --> 00:58:04,110
What’s wrong? Is the plan so ordinary?

711
00:58:05,310 --> 00:58:09,830
What... What did I say that day?

712
00:58:11,230 --> 00:58:14,130
I remember mentioning Jeong I-deun.

713
00:58:14,130 --> 00:58:19,070
Did I... Did I say something about families?

714
00:58:24,310 --> 00:58:25,400
Families?

715
00:58:26,520 --> 00:58:28,280
What?

716
00:58:28,280 --> 00:58:31,600
I really didn’t say that? Didn’t say anything?

717
00:58:31,600 --> 00:58:32,990
No.

718
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:37,930
Yeah... I think your plan is great.

719
00:58:37,930 --> 00:58:40,630
-Food is an irresistible temptation to Han Gye-jeol. -Right?

720
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:43,450
I’m good at coming up with these ideas.

721
00:58:43,450 --> 00:58:45,950
-Have a taste. -Okay.

722
00:58:45,970 --> 00:58:47,570
(Officer Kim)

723
00:58:54,010 --> 00:58:58,390
Yeah, did Tae Jung-sik wake up?

724
00:58:58,390 --> 00:59:00,440
When?

725
00:59:04,430 --> 00:59:06,610
I’ll call you back later.

726
00:59:09,830 --> 00:59:11,360
Sorry.

727
00:59:13,950 --> 00:59:16,080
Who is Tae Jung-sik?

728
00:59:23,490 --> 00:59:26,240
Kim Pil-soo’s trouble solver.

729
00:59:26,240 --> 00:59:27,600
Didn’t I tell you that

730
00:59:27,600 --> 00:59:31,490
he almost killed my sister and me.

731
00:59:31,490 --> 00:59:33,490
I heard he’s awake now.

732
00:59:39,490 --> 00:59:41,520
Excuse me, I have to take a call.

733
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,050
Yeah.

734
00:59:58,250 --> 01:00:02,630
Jeong-won.

735
01:00:09,150 --> 01:00:12,420
(My dear)

736
01:00:15,190 --> 01:00:19,050
The number you have dialed cannot be reached at this time.

737
01:00:39,400 --> 01:00:41,520
Please let us be together,

738
01:00:42,870 --> 01:00:45,240
even if we have to go to an uninhabited island.

739
01:00:45,240 --> 01:00:47,600
We won’t hurt anyone there.

740
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:51,240
Please grant me this request.

741
01:00:52,360 --> 01:00:54,600
I won’t wish for anything else.

742
01:00:54,600 --> 01:00:58,830
But I might hurt you.

743
01:01:04,690 --> 01:01:06,790
Then let’s die together.

744
01:01:06,790 --> 01:01:08,790
Don’t leave me alone in the world.

745
01:01:14,630 --> 01:01:18,210
How can I live if I kill you myself?

746
01:01:18,210 --> 01:01:20,600
Going to the underworld is not enough.

747
01:01:21,840 --> 01:01:23,950
Do you want me to linger in hell forever?

748
01:01:23,950 --> 01:01:25,630
Then what about me?

749
01:01:25,630 --> 01:01:27,630
Will I be different?

750
01:01:27,630 --> 01:01:30,600
What deadly sin did I commit to suffer this?

751
01:01:30,600 --> 01:01:31,680
Who the hell

752
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,960
binds us together with this fate?

753
01:01:36,430 --> 01:01:37,680
Let’s go and ask why.

754
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,330
Whether it’s the grandmother or someone else.

755
01:01:39,330 --> 01:01:41,750
Why is this happening? At least we need to know why we are being tortured.

756
01:01:42,840 --> 01:01:45,010
Even if we ask, Gods don’t know either.

757
01:01:46,330 --> 01:01:49,160
Fate is random. There is no reason.

758
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:52,800
Gods just roll the dice

759
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:56,720
without knowing who’ll meet number one

760
01:01:56,720 --> 01:01:58,720
nor who’ll meet number six.

761
01:01:59,770 --> 01:02:01,850
That’s irresponsible. Really!

762
01:02:05,670 --> 01:02:11,880
Only human beings would give meaning to a predetermined fate with a reason.

763
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:23,920
I don’t want to stain anyone’s blood anymore,

764
01:02:25,920 --> 01:02:30,120
nor bring tears to anyone’s eyes.

765
01:02:31,390 --> 01:02:34,190
This is the road I’ve taken to become a human being.

766
01:02:36,840 --> 01:02:38,440
Sorry.

767
01:02:39,760 --> 01:02:42,040
It’s too cruel to you,

768
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:47,330
helping me become a human being.

769
01:02:48,610 --> 01:02:50,830
There’s no time left.

770
01:02:50,830 --> 01:02:54,290
Deity, I can’t do it.

771
01:02:55,870 --> 01:02:58,830
No matter what you say, I just can’t.

772
01:03:18,760 --> 01:03:21,010
I wanted to...

773
01:03:21,010 --> 01:03:23,490
Make you laugh more often.

774
01:03:26,350 --> 01:03:28,170
Maybe...

775
01:03:31,410 --> 01:03:36,160
This is the last smile I’ll ever show you.

776
01:03:43,010 --> 01:03:45,950
While I’m still in your arms,

777
01:03:47,210 --> 01:03:48,890
protect me.

778
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:12,760
Deity.

779
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:16,910
Deity.

780
01:04:21,270 --> 01:04:23,320
Deity.

781
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:34,080
I love you.

782
01:04:45,200 --> 01:04:47,510
I love you.

783
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,190
I love you.

784
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:57,800
Once I really regret.

785
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:03,000
I knew I would make you cry in the end.

786
01:06:04,550 --> 01:06:06,680
Why should I start this relationship?

787
01:06:09,470 --> 01:06:11,840
Maybe I just wanted to try to believe

788
01:06:15,070 --> 01:06:17,350
even if God has set a sad ending,

789
01:06:18,850 --> 01:06:21,270
people can still have a happy start.

790
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:24,750
Your words,

791
01:06:24,750 --> 01:06:26,800
you courage,

792
01:06:28,720 --> 01:06:30,480
and you,

793
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,870
I’m glad I chose to start.

794
01:06:39,590 --> 01:06:42,330
Because of you, I feel happy every moment.

795
01:06:42,330 --> 01:06:46,230
How can I live without you?

796
01:06:46,230 --> 01:06:49,200
How can I live?

797
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:56,320
You have to live

798
01:06:56,320 --> 01:06:58,320
even without me.

799
01:07:00,270 --> 01:07:02,480
You must count my share and be happy.

800
01:07:07,430 --> 01:07:09,530
No matter how long it will take,

801
01:07:11,530 --> 01:07:13,750
you have to be happy.

802
01:07:37,320 --> 01:07:39,280
I love you.

803
01:07:42,320 --> 01:07:43,970
I love you.

804
01:07:46,670 --> 01:07:48,650
I love you.

805
01:07:57,200 --> 01:07:59,190
The words ‘I love you’

806
01:08:01,530 --> 01:08:03,330
turn out to be so moving.

807
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:27,000
(Next episode preview)

808
01:10:27,630 --> 01:10:30,080
Deity, come back.

809
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:33,120
You said you’d come back whenever I told you to.

810
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:36,150
Anyway, you should help me forget him.

811
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:38,430
Why do I always think about him?

812
01:10:38,430 --> 01:10:40,710
Why is it always so cruel? Why?

813
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:43,150
I didn’t hug him when he was here.

814
01:10:43,150 --> 01:10:45,590
I didn’t treat him well when he was here.

815
01:10:45,590 --> 01:10:47,590
That’s a bad move.

816
01:10:47,590 --> 01:10:49,590
Then don’t wake up.

817
01:10:49,590 --> 01:10:51,830
Let’s be together forever

818
01:10:51,830 --> 01:10:54,230
in the dream.
