1
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,290
I need to have some bites.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,620
Here, have some more.

3
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,170
(Episode 16)

4
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:35,480
Can you keep this up until spring?

5
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:52,700
(Spring)

6
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,860
(A beautiful spring day in Australia! I went on a field trip)

7
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,430
Come in.

8
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:37,950
Gak Shin,

9
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:44,400
the words, melancholy, sadness, attachment, don't suit you,

10
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:48,640
torture, accusation, persecution are the words that suit you.

11
00:01:52,160 --> 00:01:53,710
From now on, you should also keep

12
00:01:55,229 --> 00:01:57,180
tormenting Ok Shin.

13
00:01:58,310 --> 00:01:59,850
That's how you can be yourself.

14
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:02,940
Lord Deity,

15
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:07,060
why do you make it sound like you're leaving soon?

16
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:09,419
Ok Shin, even if you're not good at anything,

17
00:02:09,419 --> 00:02:11,370
and your low ability of reading the occasion is the worst,

18
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,070
you always make me laugh,

19
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:19,740
and you make me want to live.

20
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:25,840
Then...

21
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,610
Then just live a little longer.

22
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:34,579
It's so cold, when it gets warmer...

23
00:02:38,020 --> 00:02:39,790
When the weather is nice,

24
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:44,820
I'll want to live longer because it's nice.

25
00:02:44,820 --> 00:02:46,890
It'll only make everybody sadder.

26
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:51,230
You persuade him, he listened to you, right?

27
00:02:51,230 --> 00:02:53,120
Don't cry.

28
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,200
And just listen to Gak Shin more.

29
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,550
Who knows if you'll get into trouble

30
00:02:57,550 --> 00:02:58,420
because I'm not here

31
00:02:58,420 --> 00:03:00,130
and let Gak Shin worry about you?

32
00:03:00,130 --> 00:03:02,830
When I think of that, I can't leave.

33
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,520
Even so...

34
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:17,620
Thank you.

35
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:20,360
Lord Deity…

36
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:29,079
When I am alive, I complained about how lonely I was.

37
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,460
But without you,

38
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,360
these complaints would have been a luxury.

39
00:03:36,620 --> 00:03:39,950
I thought it would be easy to leave.

40
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,850
Maybe because I received too much,

41
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,110
instead, it's not easy anymore.

42
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,460
Now I have to forget everything.

43
00:03:49,460 --> 00:03:53,070
I just want you to be happy.

44
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:55,550
But I'm going to be selfish to the end.

45
00:04:14,790 --> 00:04:17,829
I hope at least my family will not forget me.

46
00:04:34,390 --> 00:04:37,680
Even if one day the memories make you sad,

47
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,080
don't be devastated.

48
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:43,600
Remember me.

49
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:06,760
When I, this waning moon has passed,

50
00:05:06,760 --> 00:05:09,090
it will come back slowly.

51
00:05:10,840 --> 00:05:12,970
Even when the moon is full,

52
00:05:12,970 --> 00:05:14,460
the waning moon will come back again.

53
00:05:15,970 --> 00:05:17,440
But I pray that time will be on your side

54
00:05:19,060 --> 00:05:20,430
to help you overcome all things.

55
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:44,430
I love you.

56
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:49,190
I love you.

57
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:53,610
I love you.

58
00:06:03,090 --> 00:06:04,580
That's beautiful.

59
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:08,730
The sentence, I love you.

60
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:03,080
I thought the world had collapsed,

61
00:09:07,080 --> 00:09:09,640
so I stopped in my tracks for a moment like death.

62
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:11,400
(Deity Deity)

63
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,480
I thought the world would mourn
(Deity Deity)

64
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:15,090
the death of a god
(Deity Deity)

65
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:17,990
that served for thousands of year with death.

66
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,080
And so it was.

67
00:09:23,230 --> 00:09:28,400
I thought that even in death, I would bear glory.

68
00:09:36,330 --> 00:09:37,280
And yet,

69
00:09:40,150 --> 00:09:45,270
death, tears, and glory

70
00:09:46,740 --> 00:09:48,560
are left to me alone.

71
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:50,260
Deity, come back!

72
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:54,800
Didn't you say you'd come if I asked you to?

73
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:03,880
(Deity)

74
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:06,110
The vain expectation,

75
00:10:08,950 --> 00:10:10,960
the familiar disappointment,

76
00:10:31,280 --> 00:10:32,930
and the bewilderment of today

77
00:10:35,250 --> 00:10:36,740
also belong to me alone.

78
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,890
She doesn’t eat or sleep.

79
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,820
She can’t be like this anymore.

80
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:52,810
I can't stand it. I have to do something. I can't stand it.

81
00:10:52,810 --> 00:10:54,420
Don't do it.

82
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:56,640
Whatever it is, don't do it.

83
00:10:56,640 --> 00:10:58,420
Listen to me.

84
00:10:58,420 --> 00:11:01,030
No, what did Lord Deity say?

85
00:11:01,030 --> 00:11:03,730
Don't listen to you, but listen to me.

86
00:11:12,570 --> 00:11:14,070
Dr. Han.

87
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:16,430
I need you to come out for a moment.

88
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:18,300
Later.

89
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:22,660
There's someone you need to see.

90
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,570
Deity.

91
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,020
Deity.

92
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:42,420
Dr. Han.

93
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,370
Come on, say it.

94
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:45,610
Hello.

95
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:50,670
A handsome uncle asked me to give it to you.

96
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:11,480
Mom?

97
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:14,380
-Are you going to help me? - Yes.

98
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:15,870
Then water the flowers.

99
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:41,760
Do you need help?

100
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,860
Yes, I need your help for a long time.

101
00:12:51,590 --> 00:12:54,160
He wants you to help him take care of it.

102
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,700
Goodbye.

103
00:13:07,350 --> 00:13:10,110
Lord Deity is very thoughtful.

104
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,920
I think that's what he meant.

105
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:15,020
When you see the flower, it's like seeing himself.

106
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:19,000
I think it means that you can take care of this flower as if you are taking care of him.

107
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:24,800
So, Dr. Han, you should eat and get some sleep.

108
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:27,790
If the master lives well, it'll live well too.

109
00:13:27,790 --> 00:13:31,140
I'm not good at raising anything.

110
00:13:31,140 --> 00:13:33,450
It is more likely that I will kill it.

111
00:13:33,450 --> 00:13:35,040
What?

112
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:37,830
Why else would my nickname be Ralph?

113
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:43,160
I've never even kept a cactus alive.

114
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:45,510
And whether it's a computer or a cell phone,

115
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,710
the things in my hands will all be broken by me.

116
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:53,210
Didn't you see that too?

117
00:13:55,250 --> 00:13:56,980
It's not enough to destroy things,

118
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,660
now even the god has been destroyed by me.

119
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:12,660
Do you want me to look at this and feel guilty?

120
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,740
Anyway, you should help me forget about him, right?

121
00:14:17,870 --> 00:14:20,200
Why do you always remind me of you?

122
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,900
Why do you have to be so cruel?

123
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:28,940
Doctor Han...

124
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,650
If she doesn't want to think about Deity,

125
00:14:37,650 --> 00:14:40,850
why does she get attached to that table all day?

126
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:42,690
Why do women always say things that don't match their actions?

127
00:14:42,690 --> 00:14:44,230
I don't understand.

128
00:14:44,230 --> 00:14:46,350
Women don't want to understand you either, okay?

129
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,820
But it's great.

130
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:51,110
Why?

131
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:53,150
Because she is still alive.

132
00:14:53,150 --> 00:14:55,660
All living people will be angry.

133
00:14:55,660 --> 00:14:58,420
That's why it's good, you idiot!

134
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,700
What are you talking about?

135
00:14:59,700 --> 00:15:02,940
For the first time, Han Gye-jeol, who is about to die, got angry like this.

136
00:15:05,010 --> 00:15:08,800
The blood flowed like this.

137
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,820
Life will come back to her.

138
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,860
Leave! Leave quickly!

139
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,410
If you feel no one's there, just leave.

140
00:15:57,580 --> 00:15:59,150
When will you stop sending it?

141
00:15:59,150 --> 00:16:01,020
What?

142
00:16:01,020 --> 00:16:05,760
That handsome uncle asked you to send it till when?

143
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,160
Five years.

144
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,600
Then you don't have to come again.

145
00:16:14,600 --> 00:16:15,380
What?

146
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:19,780
You don't like this flower?

147
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:21,330
Is it because it's not pretty enough?

148
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:26,000
There's nothing wrong with the flower.

149
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,720
It's just that I don't like it.

150
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,550
Please take it, okay?

151
00:16:30,650 --> 00:16:32,600
Mom said she has already spent all the money

152
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:34,790
we got from the uncle on the rent.

153
00:16:34,790 --> 00:16:37,860
So I can't pay you back right away.

154
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,740
In five years, I'll be able to work part-time.

155
00:16:41,740 --> 00:16:43,590
I'm not asking you to pay me back.

156
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:45,740
That should…

157
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:51,220
That’s not what that handsome uncle wants.

158
00:16:53,620 --> 00:16:55,720
Just don't send me any more flowers.

159
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,920
This will make me feel better

160
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,930
and your body would be less tired.

161
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:09,180
I'm here to work, not to beg.

162
00:17:10,819 --> 00:17:12,810
I didn't mean that.

163
00:17:17,310 --> 00:17:18,380
I'm sorry.

164
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:22,450
I'm sorry for not thinking properly.

165
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:32,270
What's your name?

166
00:17:32,270 --> 00:17:34,390
Why do you ask my name?

167
00:17:36,120 --> 00:17:37,040
Because we...

168
00:17:39,230 --> 00:17:42,140
We'll see each other every day for at least five years.

169
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:44,630
I thought I should at least know your name.

170
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:49,100
Se-jun. Bak Se-jun.

171
00:17:51,380 --> 00:17:54,790
Then nice to meet you, Se-jun.

172
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:56,970
Okay.

173
00:18:05,930 --> 00:18:07,220
See you later.

174
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:27,510
So it wasn't the flowers you asked me to raise.

175
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:47,510
(Court)

176
00:18:47,730 --> 00:18:48,670
(Defendant's stand)

177
00:18:50,340 --> 00:18:52,530
On December 13, 2018,

178
00:18:52,660 --> 00:18:56,540
witnesses tampered with the brakes of the victim Bak Nam-soo,

179
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:00,290
so the next day Bak Nam-soo died in a traffic accident.

180
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:01,980
Is that so?

181
00:19:03,190 --> 00:19:04,240
Yes.

182
00:19:04,390 --> 00:19:06,430
On February 3, 2019,

183
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,750
is it also true that you sneaked into victim I Yeong-ju 's house,

184
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,560
(Witness’s stand)

185
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,080
turned on the gas and disguised it as a fire?
(Witness’s stand)

186
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,750
turned on the gas and disguised it as a fire?

187
00:19:14,140 --> 00:19:16,040
That's right.

188
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,770
Lastly, one more question.

189
00:19:19,970 --> 00:19:25,880
Who is the person behind these murders?

190
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,850
It's the chairman of Pilseong Bio, Speaker Kim Pil-soo.

191
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,200
Tae Jung-sik.

192
00:19:47,410 --> 00:19:48,820
How dare you?

193
00:19:49,810 --> 00:19:52,020
How dare you bite me back?

194
00:19:52,420 --> 00:19:54,170
Your Honor.

195
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:57,780
The defendant, Kim Pil-soo, abetted the murder of many people.

196
00:19:57,940 --> 00:20:00,060
Under the Act on Aggravated Punishment for Specific Crimes,

197
00:20:00,260 --> 00:20:04,980
he is suspected of fraud and malpractice, and of violating the Pharmacist Act.

198
00:20:06,070 --> 00:20:11,580
I request that the defendant be sentenced to death.

199
00:20:23,630 --> 00:20:25,790
Thank you for your hard work.

200
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,860
My brother is great.

201
00:20:28,040 --> 00:20:31,330
It's not hard work. It's all my brother-in-law's doing.

202
00:20:36,690 --> 00:20:38,790
That's right.

203
00:20:38,990 --> 00:20:41,990
It's your brother-in-law who suffered, and the applause is all yours.

204
00:20:42,630 --> 00:20:44,270
So,

205
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:47,150
you can never forget the kindness of Deity in your life.

206
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:48,520
You know that?

207
00:20:48,690 --> 00:20:49,400
Yes.

208
00:20:49,570 --> 00:20:51,400
If I didn't know this, I wouldn't be Han Chul.

209
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:52,710
It's a grasshopper. A grasshopper.

210
00:20:53,770 --> 00:20:55,240
Grasshopper.

211
00:20:55,430 --> 00:20:58,700
The grasshopper won't be around for a few days after the fall, don't you know?

212
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:04,480
You're only smiling now?

213
00:21:09,660 --> 00:21:11,310
Of course I have to smile.

214
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,530
Someone once said that the god of happiness is too stupid.

215
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,760
He can't tell if people are really smiling or not.

216
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,090
So if you smile, you'll be blessed.

217
00:21:32,070 --> 00:21:33,420
What's up?

218
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,070
I want to meet the god of happiness.

219
00:21:38,270 --> 00:21:41,330
Can't you reach Jeong-won?

220
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,350
She doesn't even answer her phone.

221
00:21:47,910 --> 00:21:49,730
Did you call Jeong-won?

222
00:21:50,060 --> 00:21:51,080
Just making phone-calls?

223
00:21:51,250 --> 00:21:53,150
I even sent her messages and emails.

224
00:21:53,790 --> 00:21:55,640
I even went to her office.

225
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,190
I wanted to experience the feeling of being challenged again.

226
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:02,470
But she really didn't give me a chance.

227
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,590
Sister.

228
00:22:05,770 --> 00:22:08,580
It's not easy to solve a problem that has existed for years.

229
00:22:09,640 --> 00:22:12,420
It can also become another misunderstanding

230
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:14,860
and cause other harm.

231
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:19,600
Being hurt? So what?

232
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:23,570
At least we’re still alive!

233
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:30,330
Keep trying.

234
00:22:30,530 --> 00:22:33,210
Maybe our relationship will be a little better.

235
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:37,170
Sis, thank you.

236
00:22:37,340 --> 00:22:38,370
I'll do my best.

237
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,200
I'll really, really do my best.

238
00:22:40,390 --> 00:22:42,770
Hey, be good? To whom?

239
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:44,440
You have to choose the side in advance.

240
00:22:44,610 --> 00:22:45,430
Is it me or Tae Jeong-won?

241
00:22:45,610 --> 00:22:46,870
Who are you going to save when we're both in the water?

242
00:22:47,050 --> 00:22:49,570
Who's going to save who? You're going to save me together.

243
00:22:49,570 --> 00:22:51,550
Don't you know I can't swim?

244
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:53,670
It's worth showing off. It's worth showing off.

245
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:08,020
Let's have dinner together.

246
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:20,090
Hey, where are you going?

247
00:23:24,050 --> 00:23:26,310
Smile and the god will come.

248
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:30,520
The god of happiness, who is as dumb as me, will come.

249
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:31,940
Jeong-won.

250
00:23:37,620 --> 00:23:39,190
Try it.

251
00:23:46,940 --> 00:23:50,190
I can't get this taste even if I have taken out the egg tape.

252
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:51,170
A little bit.

253
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:55,040
Just a hint of shrimp powder makes it taste so delicious.

254
00:23:55,240 --> 00:23:57,200
Ah, shrimp powder.

255
00:23:57,390 --> 00:23:58,820
There's a lot to learn.

256
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:00,030
Of course there's a lot.

257
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,330
Even if I teach you one a day,

258
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:06,010
we'll have to live together for more than 500 years.

259
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,810
Come on, let's eat. Have some more.

260
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,610
Han Chul.

261
00:24:18,590 --> 00:24:21,480
If you could only leave one word in the world,

262
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,630
what would you leave behind?

263
00:24:27,090 --> 00:24:28,420
Tae Jeong-won.

264
00:24:32,550 --> 00:24:38,720
Eat. I'll stay. Eat.

265
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:42,570
I didn't expect you to be such a glutton.

266
00:24:44,170 --> 00:24:46,860
Because in the phrase "eat”,

267
00:24:47,230 --> 00:24:50,180
it is also about the person who said it.

268
00:24:52,770 --> 00:24:54,520
My mom said that every day.

269
00:24:54,710 --> 00:24:58,720
Jeong-won, let's eat. Jeong-won, let's eat.

270
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:02,450
When I was asleep, I woke up immediately when I heard this.

271
00:25:03,490 --> 00:25:04,930
I love the smell of my mom.

272
00:25:05,110 --> 00:25:08,410
I love the sound of her voice. I love her so much.

273
00:25:09,330 --> 00:25:14,890
I can't forgive my father for sending her away like that.

274
00:25:16,790 --> 00:25:18,810
Jeong-won.

275
00:25:20,390 --> 00:25:22,100
It's true.

276
00:25:23,250 --> 00:25:27,630
Everything I said back then was true.

277
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,170
My dad hurt my mom.

278
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:35,130
I denounced him.

279
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:39,730
He was in and out of jail over and over again.

280
00:25:40,690 --> 00:25:44,660
My dad even had 14 convictions.

281
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,410
I said I could accept it.

282
00:25:46,570 --> 00:25:48,400
Everything I've said is true.

283
00:25:48,560 --> 00:25:50,260
This time, there's an additional charge of murder.

284
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:54,330
It doesn't matter who Jeong-won's father is, and what he did.

285
00:25:57,950 --> 00:26:02,660
My father is Tae Jung-sik.

286
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,210
He killed so many people,

287
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,230
and kidnapped you. That's okay?

288
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,760
It doesn't matter.

289
00:26:25,110 --> 00:26:27,860
He almost killed your sister.

290
00:26:28,350 --> 00:26:30,190
You almost lost your only family forever.

291
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:31,690
That's okay?

292
00:26:31,850 --> 00:26:32,840
No.

293
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:34,570
When I see that guy's face, I want to kill him.

294
00:26:34,570 --> 00:26:37,400
And I will never forgive him.

295
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,990
But these are Tae Jung-sik's fault, not Tae Jeong-won's.

296
00:26:40,190 --> 00:26:42,030
It's not your fault that he is your father.

297
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,290
Yes.

298
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:45,340
It's not my fault.

299
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,960
I was born with him as my father.

300
00:26:48,110 --> 00:26:51,570
So it's not my fault that we're family.

301
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,890
But

302
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:57,650
it would be my fault if I made you my family.

303
00:26:58,370 --> 00:27:02,490
I know how hard it will be for you to hear about my father.

304
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:04,100
And every time you have to take care of my emotions.

305
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:07,090
-I know all of this. -I love you.

306
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,030
I know how hard it is for my sister, but I can't give up.

307
00:27:13,310 --> 00:27:15,160
I just love you so much, so...

308
00:27:17,020 --> 00:27:18,590
I love you more.

309
00:27:22,310 --> 00:27:26,170
More than you love me, Han Chul.

310
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:32,500
I love you much more.

311
00:27:34,550 --> 00:27:37,550
Does this guy love me?

312
00:27:37,950 --> 00:27:43,950
Is it a profit or a loss to be with him?

313
00:27:45,870 --> 00:27:47,680
You are the first person

314
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,660
who lets me not think about these problems.

315
00:27:51,830 --> 00:27:54,690
Because I’m so relieved that I could let go of all my worries to love.

316
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:59,340
I didn't even realize that I was giving my heart away.

317
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:02,730
Emotionally, you've got me hooked,

318
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:07,470
I don't want to fail in other areas as well.

319
00:28:08,230 --> 00:28:09,850
So

320
00:28:10,450 --> 00:28:12,510
are you not going to see me anymore?

321
00:28:12,690 --> 00:28:14,100
Can you live like this?

322
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:16,350
It's not that I can live,

323
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,930
it's that I have to live.

324
00:28:21,860 --> 00:28:23,550
I've always lived like this.

325
00:28:24,180 --> 00:28:25,950
It's not about what I want to do,

326
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:30,630
it's about what I have to do.

327
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,760
Jeong-won, I...

328
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:44,180
But it really feels good to say it.

329
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:48,680
I thought about just disappearing.

330
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:52,430
But the thought of not confessing to you seriously

331
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:55,800
makes me feel sorry for my heart.

332
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:03,940
I won't. I won't let you go. Never.

333
00:29:06,010 --> 00:29:07,950
Acting like this is like a stalker.

334
00:29:08,550 --> 00:29:10,470
The people you hate the most.

335
00:29:10,660 --> 00:29:12,700
Then you can report me as a stalker.

336
00:29:12,970 --> 00:29:14,530
If they want to scold me, let them scold me.

337
00:29:14,610 --> 00:29:16,560
If the police department wants to fire me, let them fire me.

338
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,240
So, don't even think about breaking up with me, there's no way.

339
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:33,260
I,

340
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,850
because of you, Han Chul,

341
00:29:38,010 --> 00:29:39,700
was really happy.

342
00:29:43,310 --> 00:29:47,080
I don't want you to be unhappy because of me.

343
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:51,820
If it really comes to that,

344
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:54,410
I won’t survive.

345
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:03,160
Goodbye.

346
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:08,650
The happiness that was within my reach.

347
00:30:32,680 --> 00:30:35,700
Honey, are you going somewhere great?

348
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,680
I want to try spending money from now on.

349
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,350
Money?

350
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:46,290
Don't I have a 10-story property?

351
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:49,070
I heard the rent is very high.

352
00:30:49,790 --> 00:30:52,360
It’s said that real estate can overcome tears.

353
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,120
Ok Shin is right sometimes.

354
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,290
What?

355
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,740
Very good.

356
00:30:57,910 --> 00:31:00,440
Since you’re going to spend Ok Shin's money, take me with you.

357
00:31:00,630 --> 00:31:02,600
What to buy first?

358
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:05,260
Bags? Shoes?

359
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:07,230
I want something bigger.

360
00:31:07,430 --> 00:31:12,480
In order to facilitate the elderly and physically challenged people to find over,

361
00:31:12,670 --> 00:31:15,390
I want a place closer to the bus and subway station.

362
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:18,650
And taking into account the problem of wheelchair access, it is best to be on the first floor.

363
00:31:18,870 --> 00:31:22,560
I'll look for a suitable place according to this.

364
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:24,350
Okay.

365
00:31:24,880 --> 00:31:27,510
Are you going to open another hospital?

366
00:31:28,530 --> 00:31:30,080
You have a lot of money now.

367
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:33,330
Why do you work when you can just spend money?

368
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:37,320
It's not work, it's effort.

369
00:31:37,790 --> 00:31:39,340
What?

370
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,960
This is the money left by Deity, isn't it?

371
00:31:43,220 --> 00:31:45,780
I think if I do something good with this money,

372
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,430
will God be kind to Deity too,

373
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,440
and send him to a good place?

374
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:52,700
(Only fried chicken will be delivered to your home? Doctors can too! Feiyun Clinic)

375
00:31:52,700 --> 00:31:54,310
Here you are.
(Only fried chicken will be delivered to your home? Doctors can too! Feiyun Clinic)

376
00:31:55,630 --> 00:31:57,300
Do you really provide door-to-door service?

377
00:31:57,470 --> 00:32:00,770
Will only fried chicken be delivered home? Doctors can too!

378
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:02,540
This is our slogan.

379
00:32:02,730 --> 00:32:05,870
Provide surgical support for the underprivileged. What does this mean?

380
00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:09,350
If you're qualified, we'll cover the full cost of surgery.

381
00:32:09,860 --> 00:32:11,850
There's no such thing as a free lunch.

382
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:14,340
They must trick you into buying health products.

383
00:32:14,630 --> 00:32:15,720
Did you grow up being tricked?

384
00:32:15,890 --> 00:32:17,410
-They're doing a good deed, aren't they? -Thank you.

385
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:19,990
You found out. There is a condition.

386
00:32:20,190 --> 00:32:21,110
Am I right?

387
00:32:21,280 --> 00:32:21,900
What is the condition?

388
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,400
Pray.

389
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:26,900
Just pray for the peace of Deity.

390
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,490
For whom?

391
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,500
Deity.

392
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,780
Freshly baked.

393
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,370
Eat while it's hot.

394
00:33:38,300 --> 00:33:39,430
Looks so delicious.

395
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,100
Not bad.

396
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:59,900
Just not bad?

397
00:33:59,900 --> 00:34:01,120
Don't you know that we are famous for bread?

398
00:34:01,120 --> 00:34:02,380
Our customers come at the right time

399
00:34:02,380 --> 00:34:04,050
when the bread is ready.

400
00:34:06,070 --> 00:34:08,860
You are waiting for the men to arrive before ordering drinks, right?

401
00:34:10,050 --> 00:34:10,880
What men?

402
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,520
When did you overhear this?

403
00:34:21,060 --> 00:34:22,380
I'm sorry.

404
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,520
Honey, we're on a blind date today.

405
00:34:23,520 --> 00:34:24,420
What?

406
00:34:24,420 --> 00:34:26,909
It's been five years since Lord Deity disappeared.

407
00:34:26,909 --> 00:34:31,130
How long are you going to be miserable and alone?

408
00:34:31,130 --> 00:34:32,880
It's not like that...

409
00:34:32,880 --> 00:34:34,530
Isn't it said that love should be forgotten with another love?

410
00:34:34,530 --> 00:34:36,510
If you want love, you have to meet the man first. Meet the man first.

411
00:34:36,510 --> 00:34:39,190
If you can't, then forget about it.

412
00:34:39,190 --> 00:34:43,040
No matter what the result is, try it first.

413
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:45,600
-I've already tried it. -What?

414
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:49,110
What's the point of trying? There's no way to start.

415
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:51,770
What are you talking nonsense about?

416
00:34:54,670 --> 00:34:55,699
Sister,

417
00:34:55,699 --> 00:34:57,990
I'm not complimenting myself.

418
00:34:57,990 --> 00:35:00,190
I'm not the Han Gye-jeol of the past anymore.

419
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,730
I have money, a hospital, and beauty.

420
00:35:02,730 --> 00:35:04,920
Can the people around me let me go?

421
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,610
They won't let you go.

422
00:35:06,610 --> 00:35:09,450
Whenever I'm called out, they say it's a blind date.

423
00:35:09,450 --> 00:35:11,920
Even so, I can't see a man.

424
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:13,120
Not at all.

425
00:35:14,630 --> 00:35:19,490
Because of this, I can't see men at all.

426
00:35:19,490 --> 00:35:20,240
(No meeting with other men in the absence of Deity)
Because of this, I can't see men at all.

427
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,310
Don't meet other men without Deity.
(No meeting with other men in the absence of Deity)

428
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,210
Don't meet other men without Deity.

429
00:35:24,210 --> 00:35:26,680
Deity has disappeared for so long,

430
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:28,820
does it still have any effect?

431
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,690
I also think so.

432
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:32,790
But, sister,

433
00:35:32,790 --> 00:35:36,080
no man will take gastrointestinal distress is a common excuse.

434
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,950
when coming out on a blind date.

435
00:35:37,950 --> 00:35:41,240
And those who are stuck in the elevator and can't get out.

436
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:45,410
Some even said they were going to ruin their ex-girlfriend's wedding and couldn’t come.

437
00:35:45,410 --> 00:35:47,160
That’s purely by accident.

438
00:35:55,220 --> 00:35:56,400
See?

439
00:35:57,300 --> 00:35:59,270
It can’t be fixed at all.

440
00:36:02,320 --> 00:36:06,540
(No meeting with other men in the absence of Deity)

441
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,230
What time is the men's date?

442
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:14,150
Men...

443
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,320
It's been 30 minutes.

444
00:36:17,320 --> 00:36:20,250
They're definitely not coming. Want to bet?

445
00:36:20,250 --> 00:36:22,480
Wait a minute. Let me call them.

446
00:36:30,340 --> 00:36:31,660
(Matchmaking woman)

447
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:41,540
Don't answer. Don't answer.

448
00:36:41,540 --> 00:36:44,540
Here you are. Okay? Go home.

449
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,970
I feel sorry for the ladies.

450
00:36:47,970 --> 00:36:51,020
Fine, I know. Share this. Just go back.

451
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:52,160
Thank you.

452
00:36:53,120 --> 00:36:54,080
Just go back.

453
00:36:56,480 --> 00:37:01,190
Thanks to our O Gyeong-seung’s good hearing, she overheard it.

454
00:37:01,190 --> 00:37:05,570
Once Nurse Seo is on a blind date, she will immediately cheat.

455
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:08,600
For sure, she is so beautiful.

456
00:37:13,390 --> 00:37:14,990
Too beautiful.

457
00:37:16,430 --> 00:37:19,340
If not charmed by that beauty, then he is not a man.

458
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:21,550
It's too unsettling.

459
00:37:21,550 --> 00:37:25,530
Anyway, please provide me information in the future.

460
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,710
It's expensive and heartbreaking. What's all this?

461
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:41,180
I really don't watch dramas.

462
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:51,140
Let's talk about it when the other one arrives.

463
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,880
Are there any other detectives besides me?

464
00:37:52,880 --> 00:37:54,460
Not really.

465
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,470
I am not nervous to see him.

466
00:38:07,470 --> 00:38:11,470
It's as if we just met yesterday.

467
00:38:11,470 --> 00:38:13,410
I take it for granted.

468
00:38:13,410 --> 00:38:17,610
Because my heart hasn't left him for a day.

469
00:38:17,610 --> 00:38:19,920
This is Detective Han Chul.

470
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:22,100
Miss. Tae Jeong-won is a doctor.

471
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,100
Please say hello to each other.

472
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:31,140
It looks like our drama is going to be a hit.

473
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:34,610
I've already heard about Dr. Tae Jeong-won's beauty.

474
00:38:34,610 --> 00:38:38,340
But I didn't expect Han Chul is also a handsome man.

475
00:38:38,340 --> 00:38:40,590
Seeing you walk in from over there,

476
00:38:40,590 --> 00:38:44,740
I thought you were a new actor.

477
00:38:44,740 --> 00:38:46,120
Thank you.

478
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,290
Is she being cute and pampering to my Chul?

479
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:51,500
Let’s get down to business. I don’t have much time.

480
00:38:51,500 --> 00:38:52,930
All right then.

481
00:39:03,420 --> 00:39:07,610
Are you a fool? Why did you listen to her say that?

482
00:39:07,610 --> 00:39:09,980
What's wrong? I think it's funny.

483
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:13,400
Funny? What's funny about it?

484
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:15,150
The TV show or the scriptwriter?

485
00:39:15,150 --> 00:39:19,030
Jeong-won is funny. Jeong-won looks funny when she's jealous.

486
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:27,980
Now that we've met, let's have a cup of tea.

487
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:31,570
No.

488
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,310
Chance becomes destiny,

489
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:37,790
destiny becomes sin, it’s enough to experience it once.

490
00:39:42,520 --> 00:39:44,070
Take care.

491
00:40:02,670 --> 00:40:05,830
Boss, is that egg roll sold out?

492
00:40:05,830 --> 00:40:07,800
They're not in stock today.

493
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,420
Come tomorrow. I'll order it for you.

494
00:40:10,420 --> 00:40:14,660
Order? Didn’t you make it yourself?

495
00:40:14,660 --> 00:40:16,310
I bought them because of that.

496
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:19,420
Yes, I made them myself.

497
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:23,440
I did make them myself, but...

498
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:26,100
What do you put in the egg rolls?

499
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:27,570
What?

500
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:34,220
Probably eggs and carrots.

501
00:40:34,220 --> 00:40:35,240
I think there's also onions.

502
00:40:49,800 --> 00:40:51,150
(Yayeong's family dishes)

503
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,500
Are you crazy?

504
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:58,800
You've made egg rolls for five years and delivered them to the grocery store?

505
00:40:58,800 --> 00:40:59,770
What are you talking about?

506
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:03,310
I know all about it now, that shrimp powder.

507
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:05,120
You're getting thinner without eating.

508
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,310
I can’t just leave you alone.

509
00:41:06,310 --> 00:41:08,700
I have to do something about it.

510
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:10,920
I can't do anything about you.

511
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:18,610
Since I’m already crazy, why don't we pretend to be crazy and live together?

512
00:41:18,610 --> 00:41:20,170
The problem between us remains unresolved.

513
00:41:20,170 --> 00:41:22,620
Maybe we'll be even more tired in the future.

514
00:41:22,620 --> 00:41:25,070
For the sake of my five years of efforts,

515
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,870
I'll try for another five years.

516
00:41:27,870 --> 00:41:29,800
Who knows? Keep trying,

517
00:41:29,800 --> 00:41:31,230
maybe it will become better.

518
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:37,820
Impossible.

519
00:41:40,940 --> 00:41:42,830
Is it?

520
00:41:42,830 --> 00:41:45,350
How can I love you more than I am now?

521
00:41:46,470 --> 00:41:48,370
That's impossible.

522
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:59,540
I love you.

523
00:42:01,420 --> 00:42:04,170
You said you love me?

524
00:42:24,190 --> 00:42:25,110
Congratulations.

525
00:42:29,220 --> 00:42:31,490
-Congratulations. -Thank you.

526
00:42:39,990 --> 00:42:43,240
I know I look old now.

527
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,010
But you don't have to show it so much, okay?

528
00:42:50,860 --> 00:42:55,730
But you're so beautiful. You're a goddess.

529
00:42:57,950 --> 00:42:59,540
Thank you, sister-in-law.

530
00:42:59,540 --> 00:43:00,920
You call me a sister-in-law?

531
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:03,830
Did you do something wrong?

532
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:04,680
No.

533
00:43:04,680 --> 00:43:06,050
Although we were friends before,

534
00:43:06,050 --> 00:43:08,480
I should follow the rules, sister-in-law.

535
00:43:08,480 --> 00:43:12,340
Okay, okay, I get it. Stop calling me sister-in-law.

536
00:43:12,340 --> 00:43:14,350
I'm getting older every day.

537
00:43:14,350 --> 00:43:15,970
I feel like I've given birth to three children being called that.

538
00:43:15,970 --> 00:43:18,200
What's wrong? I think it's fine, sister-in-law.

539
00:43:20,430 --> 00:43:21,800
Okay, sister-in-law.

540
00:43:21,800 --> 00:43:23,920
Next week is mom's memorial day.

541
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,420
Why don't you prepare the sacrificial table?

542
00:43:25,420 --> 00:43:29,010
It's all up to you to prepare a full table, sister-in-law.

543
00:43:29,010 --> 00:43:31,090
I heard that there is a restaurant in Cheongdam-Dong that specializes in sacrificial table cooking.

544
00:43:31,090 --> 00:43:32,450
Just leave it to them.

545
00:43:32,450 --> 00:43:35,010
Hey, how much does that cost?

546
00:43:35,010 --> 00:43:36,950
You have to behave yourself.

547
00:43:36,950 --> 00:43:40,470
It's said that sparrows don't fly with wild geese, they will split their legs.

548
00:43:40,470 --> 00:43:43,100
Birds don't walk, they fly.

549
00:43:43,100 --> 00:43:44,460
Who said that why worry about splitting their legs,

550
00:43:44,460 --> 00:43:48,400
if they have wings ?

551
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:50,910
What?

552
00:43:50,910 --> 00:43:52,030
Me.

553
00:43:57,350 --> 00:44:00,550
A lot of things

554
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:02,400
have happened between us.

555
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:05,410
Maybe it's to get there now.

556
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,760
Yes.

557
00:44:06,760 --> 00:44:10,300
It's not easy to be a family after all.

558
00:44:10,300 --> 00:44:12,790
Hope to get well along with you.

559
00:44:12,790 --> 00:44:14,380
Me too.

560
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:19,870
By the way, this is for you.

561
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:24,480
Where did you buy them? They're so fresh.

562
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:26,060
Of course, they're fresh.

563
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,360
I just picked them.

564
00:44:50,580 --> 00:44:51,570
Deity.

565
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,550
Deity!

566
00:45:01,020 --> 00:45:03,840
Okay, let’s go.

567
00:45:03,840 --> 00:45:06,070
What's going on?

568
00:45:06,070 --> 00:45:07,590
What's wrong?

569
00:45:07,590 --> 00:45:11,250
When did these flowers bloom?

570
00:45:13,450 --> 00:45:16,820
They haven't bloomed in five years. Amazing.

571
00:45:20,340 --> 00:45:22,820
They may bloom for some uses.

572
00:45:27,650 --> 00:45:29,750
Honey,

573
00:45:29,750 --> 00:45:31,700
if you're so disappointed,

574
00:45:31,700 --> 00:45:34,620
the flowers that are trying to bloom will feel embarrassed.

575
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,750
Congratulations.

576
00:45:44,750 --> 00:45:46,630
Thank you for coming.

577
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:47,810
Congratulations.

578
00:45:47,810 --> 00:45:49,270
Please come in.

579
00:45:49,270 --> 00:45:50,640
Let's go inside.

580
00:45:52,290 --> 00:45:54,130
Sister.

581
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:56,360
I-deun, why are you here?

582
00:45:56,360 --> 00:45:57,460
Congratulations, sis.

583
00:45:57,460 --> 00:45:58,510
Hey, how did you get here?

584
00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:01,220
Aren't you playing in America recently?

585
00:46:01,340 --> 00:46:04,640
I'm here because I'm doing a photo shoot.

586
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,760
You're really a star.

587
00:46:06,760 --> 00:46:08,660
You're on a different level.

588
00:46:15,460 --> 00:46:16,600
What?

589
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:19,160
But, why haven't I seen my brother?

590
00:46:19,160 --> 00:46:20,930
I thought he would come here.

591
00:46:23,850 --> 00:46:26,160
He probably has extended his time studying abroad.

592
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:28,270
What's the point of leaving his girlfriend behind and studying abroad?

593
00:46:55,830 --> 00:46:59,810
Here is a vow to God.

594
00:46:59,810 --> 00:47:04,470
Mr. Han Chul, the groom, and Miss Tae Jeong-won, the bride, are officially married.

595
00:47:39,360 --> 00:47:42,050
Take care, sister-in-law, have a good time.

596
00:47:42,050 --> 00:47:43,800
If he bothers you, call me.

597
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,800
Okay, sister.

598
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:46,990
Are you all packed?

599
00:47:46,990 --> 00:47:48,660
Yes, I'm all packed.

600
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:51,570
Let's have a hug.

601
00:47:51,570 --> 00:47:53,140
Ah, you are really annoying.

602
00:47:55,540 --> 00:47:57,030
Hurry up and go!

603
00:47:57,030 --> 00:47:58,130
Treat her well.

604
00:47:58,130 --> 00:47:59,050
Don't cry.

605
00:47:59,050 --> 00:48:00,850
Alright, alright.

606
00:48:00,850 --> 00:48:02,000
Have fun!

607
00:48:33,290 --> 00:48:34,910
Please stay alive.

608
00:48:36,220 --> 00:48:37,530
Even if I'm not here,

609
00:48:39,000 --> 00:48:40,530
you have to be happy even for me.

610
00:48:42,970 --> 00:48:44,680
Even if it takes a long time,

611
00:48:47,130 --> 00:48:48,760
you have to be happy.

612
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:54,590
As you wish,

613
00:48:56,620 --> 00:48:58,150
I am very happy now.

614
00:49:02,210 --> 00:49:05,870
More patients rely on me when they are uncomfortable.

615
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:11,280
When I'm sad, I have more family members to rely on.

616
00:49:14,930 --> 00:49:16,940
Although I still cry,

617
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:21,900
it's not because I'm unhappy.

618
00:49:25,530 --> 00:49:26,560
I am happy.

619
00:49:35,930 --> 00:49:37,740
But I still miss you.

620
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:47,330
I miss you so much that I'm going crazy.

621
00:51:02,230 --> 00:51:04,030
Am I dreaming again?

622
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:16,310
When I wake up, I feel so miserable that I would rather not dream it.

623
00:51:45,790 --> 00:51:47,040
Then don't wake up.

624
00:51:48,110 --> 00:51:52,650
Live with me in this dream forever.

625
00:51:57,230 --> 00:51:58,920
Deity.

626
00:52:52,870 --> 00:52:54,160
I think I ate too much.

627
00:52:57,060 --> 00:52:58,840
What did you eat to make this happen?

628
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:03,130
Lobster. What should I do?

629
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:06,530
Do you get indigestion?

630
00:53:13,790 --> 00:53:14,690
Ah?

631
00:53:17,860 --> 00:53:19,930
Do I get a severe indigestion?

632
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:21,190
I'm having hallucinations.

633
00:53:21,190 --> 00:53:23,400
No, no. I'm having hallucinations now too.

634
00:53:25,390 --> 00:53:28,520
How long do I have to stand here?

635
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:38,150
Wait a minute, is this real?

636
00:53:48,360 --> 00:53:49,630
It is Lord Deity!

637
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:55,130
When are you going to salute me?

638
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:57,320
Deity...

639
00:53:57,320 --> 00:54:00,370
Lord Deity!

640
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:03,000
Lord Deity, when did you come?

641
00:54:07,250 --> 00:54:09,340
Lord Deity!

642
00:54:09,630 --> 00:54:12,030
I love you!

643
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,680
What should I do?

644
00:54:19,990 --> 00:54:21,110
Introduce me to your family anytime.

645
00:54:21,110 --> 00:54:22,850
(Article 3: Introduce me to your family at any time.)
Introduce me to your family anytime.

646
00:54:22,850 --> 00:54:23,510
(Article 3: Introduce me to your family at any time.)

647
00:54:24,050 --> 00:54:26,990
Really... Is that really why you're here?

648
00:54:27,940 --> 00:54:31,160
Because I have a new family, so you ask me to introduce...

649
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,020
How can that be?

650
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:37,510
Didn't I say it for many times that it's God's promise to make the impossible possible?

651
00:54:37,510 --> 00:54:39,740
Otherwise, how could such a powerful god of the underworld

652
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,130
listen to a human being?

653
00:54:43,210 --> 00:54:44,600
By the way,

654
00:54:44,600 --> 00:54:47,740
why does my brother-in-law get married so late?

655
00:54:47,740 --> 00:54:52,080
If he wants to get married, don't delay. He should have just done it directly.

656
00:54:52,080 --> 00:54:56,110
He also had to deal with something.

657
00:54:56,110 --> 00:54:58,000
I just feel pitiful.

658
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,090
It's a pity that we didn't see each other for 5 years.

659
00:55:14,660 --> 00:55:16,620
How did you spend these five years?

660
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:22,920
Wind...

661
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:29,040
Probably because of the wind.

662
00:55:37,190 --> 00:55:39,330
Like a lion that is not frightened by sound.

663
00:55:40,510 --> 00:55:42,850
Like a wind that is not stopped by the net.

664
00:55:43,940 --> 00:55:46,990
All my worries disappeared, and I was free.

665
00:55:48,820 --> 00:55:51,890
I thought I, who could tell who I was, disappeared.

666
00:55:53,050 --> 00:55:57,530
Ah, thank you for doing such a good job.

667
00:55:57,530 --> 00:55:59,570
-Not at all. -Thank you.

668
00:56:01,080 --> 00:56:03,840
The tens of thousands of voices that prayed for me...

669
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,930
Came with the wind.

670
00:56:08,230 --> 00:56:11,640
The voice calling for Deity caught me.

671
00:56:14,020 --> 00:56:16,290
And finally I came back like this.

672
00:56:18,260 --> 00:56:19,480
Really?

673
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:23,000
Did you really hear the prayers?

674
00:56:27,380 --> 00:56:30,440
Did those people really pray for you?

675
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:34,400
I've been listening to the voices of curses all my life.

676
00:56:36,210 --> 00:56:38,620
So I really hated people's voices.

677
00:56:38,620 --> 00:56:42,100
But there are voices that can save me.

678
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:46,010
Now...

679
00:56:46,010 --> 00:56:48,110
I can hear them with both my ears.

680
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,270
I heard that God has one ear because he is tired of hearing people's words.

681
00:56:56,270 --> 00:56:59,590
You've really become a human being. You've become a human being.

682
00:57:08,700 --> 00:57:11,570
You've become a human being, right?

683
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:17,260
What's wrong?

684
00:57:17,260 --> 00:57:20,070
I still look as handsome as a God. So you can't believe that?

685
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:23,860
You're not going anywhere anymore, right?

686
00:57:24,950 --> 00:57:28,390
You won't disappear like a bubble in the morning... Right?

687
00:57:32,080 --> 00:57:35,390
No... Bubble... Who is that?

688
00:57:35,390 --> 00:57:37,520
You mean the Mermaid Princess?

689
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:42,030
I... Even if you say I’m a doll, I'll accept it.

690
00:57:42,030 --> 00:57:47,000
Deity, Pinocchio, they're similar dolls.

691
00:57:47,000 --> 00:57:50,770
But... Isn't seafood a little too much?

692
00:57:50,770 --> 00:57:53,370
So

693
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:56,290
you'll always be by my side, right?

694
00:57:57,270 --> 00:57:59,700
So...

695
00:58:01,070 --> 00:58:03,490
From now on to the future,

696
00:58:03,490 --> 00:58:06,000
from this life to the next,

697
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:09,400
I'm the only man in your life.

698
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,650
You're in big trouble.

699
00:58:51,590 --> 00:58:52,780
You've grown up.

700
00:58:54,820 --> 00:58:56,090
That's great.

701
00:59:09,710 --> 00:59:11,150
I am now...

702
00:59:16,320 --> 00:59:17,080
What?

703
00:59:17,080 --> 00:59:18,170
It's for you.

704
00:59:18,170 --> 00:59:19,820
-For me? -Yeah.

705
00:59:25,190 --> 00:59:26,680
-Goodbye. -For me...

706
00:59:39,590 --> 00:59:41,760
What... What's she doing?

707
00:59:41,760 --> 00:59:44,950
Gak Shin, why is your body so...

708
00:59:44,950 --> 00:59:46,880
Are you sick?

709
00:59:46,880 --> 00:59:47,950
I'm going to water.

710
00:59:50,660 --> 00:59:51,670
What's wrong with her?

711
00:59:54,990 --> 00:59:56,070
No...

712
00:59:56,070 --> 00:59:58,340
What's going on here?

713
00:59:59,170 --> 01:00:02,770
Hey, hey. Your room is not on the second floor.

714
01:00:02,770 --> 01:00:04,400
-Cheers! -Cheers!

715
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:12,530
-Come on, come on. -What do you want to eat?

716
01:00:12,530 --> 01:00:14,510
-Strawberries. -Mmm, strawberries. Strawberries.

717
01:00:14,510 --> 01:00:16,500
Gak Shin, do you have no arms or legs? What's wrong with you?

718
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,680
-It is too far. -Too far.

719
01:00:18,680 --> 01:00:20,540
Put your tongue...

720
01:00:20,540 --> 01:00:21,750
I want strawberries too.

721
01:00:22,910 --> 01:00:25,540
Deity also thinks it's far.

722
01:00:25,540 --> 01:00:27,130
Isn't it?

723
01:00:27,130 --> 01:00:28,870
-Give me that. -Strawberries?

724
01:00:34,700 --> 01:00:40,480
The unbearably ordinary days are over.

725
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:50,520
The days when I'm so happy that I'm afraid of being jealous of misfortune.

726
01:01:09,950 --> 01:01:11,280
Deity!

727
01:01:34,030 --> 01:01:35,790
Alas, it is noisy!

728
01:01:35,790 --> 01:01:38,610
Please let me get some sleep. Sleep!

729
01:01:38,610 --> 01:01:40,290
Is it....

730
01:01:40,290 --> 01:01:43,350
Is it that he can still hear something?

731
01:02:04,730 --> 01:02:06,310
Is this a prison?

732
01:02:13,330 --> 01:02:14,360
Prison?

733
01:02:14,360 --> 01:02:15,640
Is he really there?

734
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:18,060
I saw the photo you sent me. I'm sure it's him.

735
01:02:18,170 --> 01:02:19,700
You said you were looking for a rapist and murderer.

736
01:02:19,700 --> 01:02:21,460
Since he is in prison, why can't you find him?

737
01:02:21,460 --> 01:02:24,060
The photo was too blurry to get the features of the suspect.

738
01:02:24,060 --> 01:02:27,600
Maybe he's in jail for fraud or robbery or something else.

739
01:02:27,600 --> 01:02:30,960
Bastard, I'll let you rot in jail forever.

740
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,640
This time

741
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:37,830
help me find out where this guy is.

742
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:38,760
Why should I do that?

743
01:02:38,760 --> 01:02:40,050
Haven't I helped you enough?

744
01:02:40,050 --> 01:02:42,270
I've done a lot for you, and you can't even do this?

745
01:02:42,270 --> 01:02:43,220
What have you done for me?

746
01:02:43,220 --> 01:02:46,050
I got married so you could come back.

747
01:02:46,050 --> 01:02:49,910
Do you know how hard it was for me to get married?

748
01:02:49,910 --> 01:02:53,360
If it weren't me, you wouldn't even be able to see my sister.

749
01:02:53,360 --> 01:02:55,830
Is that how you treat your savior?

750
01:02:55,830 --> 01:02:58,960
What's good is good. Let's help each other.

751
01:02:58,960 --> 01:03:01,400
It's only good for you. Why talk about helping each other?

752
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:03,550
Who knows? If you keep doing good things,

753
01:03:03,550 --> 01:03:05,450
maybe you'll really become a human in the end.

754
01:03:06,890 --> 01:03:08,760
Forget it.

755
01:03:08,760 --> 01:03:10,360
I'll build up my good deeds myself,

756
01:03:10,360 --> 01:03:12,270
and you should fulfill your tasks yourself.

757
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:15,180
Ah? Are you really going to do this?

758
01:03:15,180 --> 01:03:17,180
You think you're so open and honest.

759
01:03:17,180 --> 01:03:18,800
Then I'll go see my sister now.

760
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,270
-Okay? -No need.

761
01:03:23,950 --> 01:03:26,460
Since I'm here now, you don't have to leave.

762
01:03:26,460 --> 01:03:29,080
You... Why are you here?

763
01:03:29,950 --> 01:03:31,440
No...

764
01:03:33,190 --> 01:03:35,290
Oh, I'm in a hurry. Excuse me.

765
01:03:35,290 --> 01:03:36,520
Brother-in-law,

766
01:03:36,520 --> 01:03:38,530
help each other!

767
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:43,550
No...

768
01:04:01,610 --> 01:04:05,410
Your wish doesn't come true completely.

769
01:04:09,820 --> 01:04:11,620
You’re still a god, right?

770
01:04:15,740 --> 01:04:20,200
So you can still hear that strange voice?

771
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,910
I see you're still talking to yourself.

772
01:04:22,910 --> 01:04:24,800
Oh, well...

773
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,150
I'm on the phone with my brother-in-law.

774
01:04:28,150 --> 01:04:31,680
I can't hear that voice anymore. It's true.

775
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,880
That's great.

776
01:04:32,880 --> 01:04:36,280
If that's the case, you should have told me. Why did you keep it a secret?

777
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:38,170
I was afraid you'd be disappointed.

778
01:04:38,170 --> 01:04:41,860
You've been through so much and you've broken your heart.

779
01:04:41,860 --> 01:04:45,190
If you knew I was still the same person,

780
01:04:45,190 --> 01:04:48,000
you must feel that all your hard work before is wasted.

781
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:51,440
It's normal for people to have unsatisfying things in life.

782
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,470
If you are disappointed every time, how can you live?

783
01:04:53,470 --> 01:04:57,030
It is better not to get what you want.

784
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,540
Back to square one, that's what makes people crazy.

785
01:04:59,540 --> 01:05:02,100
Or why would Sisyphus be punished like that?

786
01:05:02,100 --> 01:05:03,120
Who said that?

787
01:05:03,120 --> 01:05:05,750
Back to square one?

788
01:05:05,750 --> 01:05:08,820
Maybe you think you're still a god, so you're back to square one.

789
01:05:08,820 --> 01:05:10,920
But I don't think so.

790
01:05:10,920 --> 01:05:13,500
Because my thinking has developed.

791
01:05:13,500 --> 01:05:14,320
How has it developed?

792
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,780
I once lost my temper because I was dismissed from the hospital.

793
01:05:17,780 --> 01:05:19,720
It's either money, support, or even God.

794
01:05:19,720 --> 01:05:21,640
At least give me one of them.

795
01:05:21,640 --> 01:05:25,430
I thought that God only has one ear and can't hear my heart.

796
01:05:25,430 --> 01:05:26,330
I never thought I would really be given money,

797
01:05:26,330 --> 01:05:29,610
and get a real god to be my backer.

798
01:05:31,740 --> 01:05:33,280
Now that my wish has been fulfilled,

799
01:05:33,280 --> 01:05:37,330
I feel satisfied and won't wallow in self-pity.

800
01:05:37,330 --> 01:05:38,200
How many women do you think

801
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:41,600
can fall in love with a god?

802
01:05:41,600 --> 01:05:43,460
Now that you are here, I should enjoy the time.

803
01:05:43,460 --> 01:05:45,850
Why didn't I think of that?

804
01:05:50,270 --> 01:05:52,590
Let's go.

805
01:05:58,660 --> 01:05:59,680
Where?

806
01:05:59,680 --> 01:06:01,360
Wherever it is.

807
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,360
Okay.

808
01:06:16,590 --> 01:06:18,390
Why do we come here again?

809
01:06:18,390 --> 01:06:19,700
Who knows?

810
01:06:19,700 --> 01:06:21,020
Maybe because of the power of the Smurfs,

811
01:06:21,020 --> 01:06:23,420
Deity can become a real human.

812
01:06:23,420 --> 01:06:26,630
It's impossible. Even if the Smurfs' grandmother appeared,

813
01:06:26,630 --> 01:06:28,570
Deity cannot become a human.

814
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:32,860
This is not the story of the cowardly Pinocchio.

815
01:06:32,860 --> 01:06:36,310
It's about a brutal beast.

816
01:06:36,310 --> 01:06:37,870
A long time ago,

817
01:06:37,870 --> 01:06:41,430
a beast lived in a towering palace.

818
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:43,520
The beast had to meet a woman who might think he was horrible

819
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:45,750
but still fall in love with him.

820
01:06:45,750 --> 01:06:47,820
So that the curse could be lifted.

821
01:06:47,820 --> 01:06:50,250
Finally a beauty appeared

822
01:06:50,250 --> 01:06:54,190
and confessed her love to the beast.

823
01:06:54,190 --> 01:06:57,950
But the beast did not become a prince.

824
01:06:57,950 --> 01:06:59,540
Why?

825
01:06:59,540 --> 01:07:02,580
Because the woman fell in love with

826
01:07:02,580 --> 01:07:04,290
the beast,

827
01:07:04,290 --> 01:07:06,170
but not the prince.

828
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,400
Is it a magic trick?

829
01:07:18,400 --> 01:07:20,080
Whenever we come here,

830
01:07:20,080 --> 01:07:22,610
you will cling to me.

831
01:07:23,960 --> 01:07:26,310
That's a foul trick.

832
01:07:26,310 --> 01:07:29,190
Ah, why does it become a foul trick?

833
01:07:32,760 --> 01:07:36,680
I can't give you a hug while you are still here.

834
01:07:36,680 --> 01:07:39,690
I don't treat you well while you are still here.

835
01:07:40,610 --> 01:07:43,900
We don't love each other while you are still here.

836
01:07:43,900 --> 01:07:46,450
They are all foul tricks.

837
01:07:55,640 --> 01:07:59,810
So I want to ask

838
01:07:59,810 --> 01:08:02,270
how long can you treat me well?

839
01:08:02,270 --> 01:08:03,870
What?

840
01:08:03,870 --> 01:08:09,660
I know the God of the underworld can't stay here forever.

841
01:08:09,660 --> 01:08:12,080
I'm asking you when you'll return.

842
01:08:13,770 --> 01:08:15,940
When you return.

843
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:16,790
What?

844
01:08:16,790 --> 01:08:19,350
While I was waiting for you in the underworld,

845
01:08:19,350 --> 01:08:22,399
you were repeating your destiny of destroying yourself,

846
01:08:22,399 --> 01:08:23,910
and wandering in the world.

847
01:08:23,910 --> 01:08:28,580
In this life you have finally severed the painful bond of destiny.

848
01:08:28,580 --> 01:08:33,790
And I will protect you until you return to the underworld.

849
01:08:33,790 --> 01:08:36,750
I will welcome you back since it will be the first time you die.

850
01:08:36,750 --> 01:08:39,960
My mission will be restarted again.

851
01:08:39,960 --> 01:08:43,470
And then, I don't know when, but one day, when you are reborn,

852
01:08:43,470 --> 01:08:47,240
I will come to the world and meet you again.

853
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:49,680
Then it won't be a punishment.

854
01:08:49,680 --> 01:08:51,990
I think it will be a vacation.

855
01:08:51,990 --> 01:08:56,939
So, is it a punishment or a vacation? How do you know?

856
01:08:56,939 --> 01:09:00,300
Isn't that the will of a fickle god?

857
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:02,120
Even if it's a great god,

858
01:09:02,120 --> 01:09:03,979
he can't just do whatever he wants.

859
01:09:03,979 --> 01:09:05,319
It's said that experience counts.

860
01:09:05,319 --> 01:09:08,569
You can't find a god of the underworld like me.

861
01:09:08,569 --> 01:09:09,649
Really?

862
01:09:09,649 --> 01:09:11,649
Gak Shin once said so.

863
01:09:11,649 --> 01:09:15,800
She felt tired because she could not find someone to replace me.

864
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:17,979
It may seem simple to be a guide on the road to hades.

865
01:09:17,979 --> 01:09:19,229
But it's definitely not.

866
01:09:19,229 --> 01:09:21,990
An ear that doesn't listen to the stories of the dead.

867
01:09:21,990 --> 01:09:25,040
A heart that is not shaken by emotions.

868
01:09:25,040 --> 01:09:28,390
These are not advantages that everyone can have.

869
01:09:28,390 --> 01:09:29,810
Of course.

870
01:09:31,630 --> 01:09:33,729
You have suffered a lot,

871
01:09:33,729 --> 01:09:35,810
but you have to continue...

872
01:09:45,720 --> 01:09:48,100
It'll get better.

873
01:10:11,290 --> 01:10:14,050
I'm still working on it.

874
01:10:14,050 --> 01:10:16,340
May tomorrow be better than today.

875
01:10:17,940 --> 01:10:20,630
May next year be better than this year.

876
01:10:25,460 --> 01:10:28,690
May the next life be better than this one.

877
01:10:29,480 --> 01:10:31,970
-May all that destiny -May all that destiny

878
01:10:31,970 --> 01:10:34,390
-can let me be with you forever. -can let me be with you forever.

879
01:10:46,910 --> 01:10:48,910
