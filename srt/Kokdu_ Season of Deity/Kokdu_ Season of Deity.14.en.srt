1
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:04,850
(Episode 14)

2
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:18,200
I miss you so much

3
00:00:19,180 --> 00:00:20,860
I want to hug you so much.

4
00:00:22,010 --> 00:00:27,940
I'm grateful just to be alive like this.

5
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,300
What’s the matter?

6
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,730
You wanted to see me all of a sudden. I was worried too.

7
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,220
Do you remember Seol Hui?

8
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,660
Why did you suddenly bring up Seol Hui?

9
00:00:54,050 --> 00:00:57,080
It's just strange.

10
00:00:57,080 --> 00:01:00,400
Someone who's been looking for Seol Hui for so long.

11
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:03,780
How could he not know if I was Seol Hui?

12
00:01:05,209 --> 00:01:06,820
I thought about it for a while.

13
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:10,770
I remembered that you said you didn't even remember her name or face.

14
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:20,310
That's right. I don't remember Seol Hui.

15
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,900
That's the kind of place I'm in.

16
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,789
My throat was on fire. I was filled with thirst.

17
00:01:28,789 --> 00:01:31,340
The desires and emotions were burning.

18
00:01:31,340 --> 00:01:35,080
Under the blade of a snowstorm, all memories disappear.

19
00:01:35,080 --> 00:01:38,370
The storm causes the loss of feelings, loss of memories.

20
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:41,690
It was God's will for me to start a new life.

21
00:01:41,690 --> 00:01:44,979
But I didn't follow that will.

22
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:50,860
Why? What's left after all the memories are gone?

23
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,020
Obsession.

24
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,680
Obsession fills the gap.

25
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,130
That's why I was so angry when I first saw you.

26
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:05,710
The obsession with you had reached a stupid level.

27
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:09,160
It was a terrible feeling.

28
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,240
But I was attracted to that feeling.

29
00:02:14,030 --> 00:02:17,520
Then if Seol Hui appears now

30
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:22,820
and recognizes you,

31
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:25,040
will you feel happy?

32
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,430
No.

33
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:40,690
Why? Haven't you been waiting for a long time?

34
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:46,970
I don't know anything else.

35
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:48,590
But I do know one thing.

36
00:02:56,260 --> 00:03:00,640
While I was away, that woman must have been very unhappy.

37
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,020
I don't want that woman to know she was unhappy.

38
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:07,290
If we have to look back on that misfortune together,

39
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,910
it is impossible to be happy.

40
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:16,860
So my misfortune

41
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:19,650
will make you feel unhappy once again

42
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:27,900
What a blessing!

43
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:30,410
What blessing?

44
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:34,920
I was worried that I wouldn't be able to compete with that woman

45
00:03:34,920 --> 00:03:37,950
But now I think I'm not so bad.

46
00:03:37,950 --> 00:03:40,000
It's worth a fight, right?

47
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:44,700
I'm asking you.

48
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:47,510
It's me or Seol Hui. Choose.

49
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:53,550
I have an obligation to make that woman happy.

50
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:58,980
Love is not an obligation.

51
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,050
If you think it's an obligation,

52
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:03,280
that woman will be unhappy too.

53
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,700
Love.

54
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:09,560
Maybe for some people it's a shining passion,

55
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:12,160
it's heartbreaking pity,

56
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:14,280
it's an endless obsession,

57
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,860
but for me it's a lifelong obligation to gamble,

58
00:04:20,860 --> 00:04:22,990
although I can't get rid of it,

59
00:04:22,990 --> 00:04:26,020
it's an obligation that I don't want to get rid of either.

60
00:04:35,330 --> 00:04:36,350
No.

61
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:42,550
I really can't do that.

62
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:49,850
That's why I can't give up on you.

63
00:04:51,990 --> 00:04:55,770
Because you are the one who believes that love is an obligation.

64
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,470
Because you're the one who bet your life.

65
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:01,170
You're the one who will do your duty.

66
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:19,920
Even if this hand grows old and wrinkles one day.

67
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:26,560
Can you still do your duty and keep holding my hand?

68
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,640
The winter of sadness,

69
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:47,620
this season is over.

70
00:05:47,620 --> 00:05:50,520
You will have a bright spring too, right?

71
00:05:52,570 --> 00:05:55,520
I will wait for

72
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,390
the first spring that we spend together.

73
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:50,540
(Friday, November 18 Send-off)

74
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:53,409
There are less than 10 days left.

75
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:00,240
Why are you so sad out there? Why don't you get in?

76
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,970
It's because of you.

77
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:02,620
What's wrong with me?

78
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:04,080
Because you said something about an omen or something like that.

79
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:06,670
I'm so upset now.

80
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,000
He has made up with Han Gye-jeol.

81
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,400
And he’s happy to stay in the world.

82
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,790
I'm really afraid that something bad will happen.

83
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:18,890
When did you see me say something right?

84
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,190
You're right.

85
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:26,200
Don't worry, he won't die that easily.

86
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,370
I think I said the wrong thing.

87
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,620
Wrong what?

88
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,200
In the TV show,

89
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:34,140
if you say something like that, you'll die for sure.

90
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:37,260
You want to die?

91
00:07:37,260 --> 00:07:39,400
Go to hell! Go to hell!

92
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,810
What are you talking about?

93
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:41,960
What did I say?

94
00:07:58,970 --> 00:08:03,030
How the hell did you hit him like that?

95
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:05,820
You hit him where you don't normally hit him.

96
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,360
It seemed like a big blow.

97
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,710
Well done. I'm glad he's depressed.

98
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:12,910
You should hit him more often, and only concentrate on that area.

99
00:08:12,910 --> 00:08:14,510
Since it's an order from Lord Deity.

100
00:08:14,510 --> 00:08:18,300
I'll do my best.

101
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:21,810
Shut up!

102
00:08:21,810 --> 00:08:23,040
What are you yelling about?

103
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,950
What did Jung I-deun say, go to America?

104
00:08:27,950 --> 00:08:31,240
I told him that you're a burden to the Bulhwa Company.

105
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:33,730
Come back when it's over

106
00:08:33,730 --> 00:08:36,330
So he agreed.

107
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:37,919
That's good.

108
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,340
What about you, Ok Shin?

109
00:08:42,470 --> 00:08:43,809
Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes.

110
00:08:43,809 --> 00:08:46,020
I've found it! I've found it!

111
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:48,970
I've found it.

112
00:08:48,970 --> 00:08:51,360
One of the bereaved families approached me.

113
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,920
A woman came to me and said

114
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,940
her mother had an X-ray before she died, but she wanted to go to a major hospital.

115
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:58,080
So she went to Pilseong Hospital.

116
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,380
The hospital said there was nothing wrong, so she was relieved.

117
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,490
But a few days later, her mother committed suicide.

118
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:12,010
She kept crying, saying that her mother was not the type of person who would commit suicide.

119
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:13,400
Her heart was torn apart.

120
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:20,650
I had to convince the bereaved family no matter what.

121
00:09:23,650 --> 00:09:28,430
I wanted to find out about Tae Jung-sik and take him to court.

122
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:30,740
But I heard that he hurt himself.

123
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,860
What?

124
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:43,620
I don't know if it was self-inflicted or mutilated.

125
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:47,050
Anyway, he's not in a position to make a case.

126
00:09:47,050 --> 00:09:49,790
Then how do you think it would be better for Mr. Jung to come forward as a victim?

127
00:09:49,790 --> 00:09:50,850
This should be a strong statement.

128
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:53,450
Didn’t you said that he will go to the United States that day?

129
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:55,980
Okay, I got it.

130
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,080
Lord Deity, are you going to attend the court?

131
00:09:59,080 --> 00:10:02,240
I'm the one who's suing. If I don't go, who will?

132
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,960
Case number 2022, civil case number 382.

133
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,950
The trial of the plaintiff, Do Jin-woo, will now begin. The defendant, Kim Pil-soo.

134
00:10:11,950 --> 00:10:14,260
(Defendant)
The trial of the plaintiff, Do Jin-woo, will now begin. The defendant, Kim Pil-soo.

135
00:10:14,260 --> 00:10:15,180
The trial of the plaintiff, Do Jin-woo, will now begin. The defendant, Kim Pil-soo.

136
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:18,340
Defendant, please begin your defense.

137
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,290
November 8th.

138
00:10:27,290 --> 00:10:30,830
Ms. Kim Jin-ah, You've met with Chairman I Eung-chul of the Bulhwa Company?

139
00:10:30,830 --> 00:10:31,400
(Plaintiff)
Ms. Kim Jin-ah, You've met with Chairman I Eung-chul of the Bulhwa Company?

140
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,450
Yes.
(Plaintiff)

141
00:10:32,450 --> 00:10:32,610
(Witness)
Yes.
(Plaintiff)

142
00:10:32,610 --> 00:10:35,190
He said he wanted to ask me about my mother in person.
(Witness)

143
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:37,110
He said he wanted to ask me about my mother in person.

144
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:38,140
Your son underwent 12 surgeries for Appel's syndrome, right?

145
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:41,770
(Appel's syndrome Premature closure of cranial sutures before brain development due to genetic mutation)
Your son underwent 12 surgeries for Appel's syndrome, right?

146
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:42,390
Your Honor,
(Appel's syndrome Premature closure of cranial sutures before brain development due to genetic mutation)

147
00:10:42,390 --> 00:10:42,920
Your Honor,

148
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:44,740
this is a question that is not relevant to this case.

149
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:47,530
It's to confirm the reliability of the witness's statement.

150
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:50,530
The witness who owed over 100 million won for her son's medical bills alone.

151
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:55,980
She paid off all the debts after that day.

152
00:10:55,980 --> 00:10:57,420
Is this really a coincidence?

153
00:10:57,420 --> 00:10:59,180
What is he trying to say?

154
00:10:59,180 --> 00:11:02,410
Defense, please continue.

155
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,700
On November 8, that day...

156
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:08,140
Did you take money from Mr. I for perjury?

157
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:10,190
Did you take money from Mr. I Eung-chul?

158
00:11:10,190 --> 00:11:11,150
What?

159
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,030
Yes.
(Defendants)

160
00:11:16,030 --> 00:11:18,200
Yes, you're right.

161
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,090
When did I...

162
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:19,750
(Witness)
When did I...

163
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:20,290
Me? Are you crazy?
(Witness)

164
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:22,380
Me? Are you crazy?

165
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:24,090
Hey, when did I...? You're a dick.

166
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:26,130
Silence, please. Silence.

167
00:11:28,410 --> 00:11:33,720
Man is evil, but God is soft-hearted.

168
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:35,500
That's why it's worth living.

169
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,980
What did you say?

170
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:38,230
Kim Pil-soo.

171
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:40,150
What did you do to the witness?

172
00:11:41,210 --> 00:11:43,210
You bastard!

173
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:43,940
I should have known.

174
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:45,890
I might as well have spent money to get someone to testify.

175
00:11:45,890 --> 00:11:46,480
If that were the case,

176
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:50,110
you wouldn't have been instructed by Kim Pil-soo to do that, would you?

177
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:52,240
Didn't you say the National Tax Service would come to investigate?

178
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:54,100
If there's evidence of bribery,

179
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:57,010
then it'll really be the breakthrough that Kim Pil-soo wanted.

180
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:58,520
That's true.

181
00:11:58,520 --> 00:12:00,550
Anyway, the prosecutor's investigation and the National Tax Service...

182
00:12:00,550 --> 00:12:03,060
I won't be able to say anything for a while.

183
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,920
What should I do?

184
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:05,290
Lord Deity.

185
00:12:05,290 --> 00:12:10,770
It's not too late for Mr. Jung to come back from the US.

186
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:12,820
He just left the country today. How can I call him...

187
00:12:12,820 --> 00:12:14,830
He's on a plane. He's in the sky, you bastard.

188
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:25,040
What's wrong with you?

189
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:28,710
Why is he here when he's supposed to be on a plane?

190
00:12:28,710 --> 00:12:31,070
I saw the news at the airport.

191
00:12:31,070 --> 00:12:33,450
I came back because I wanted to ask you a question.

192
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:36,610
If the side effect is cancer...

193
00:12:36,610 --> 00:12:39,180
Then I have the side effect too, right?

194
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,540
What?

195
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:43,390
This is my own body.

196
00:12:43,390 --> 00:12:46,570
How can I not even confirm whether I have cancer or not?

197
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:49,060
Seeing that my brother was desperately trying to hide it,

198
00:12:49,060 --> 00:12:52,090
I just pretended I didn't know.

199
00:12:52,090 --> 00:12:54,740
Anyway, I couldn't help here.

200
00:12:54,740 --> 00:12:57,190
So I thought it would be better to go to America.

201
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,630
Why did you come back if you know it all? Just go.

202
00:13:01,630 --> 00:13:05,680
Even if Jung I-deun is useless, Nam Se-ri should still be useful.

203
00:13:08,150 --> 00:13:12,370
Now I understand why Kim Pil-soo won't let me go.

204
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:17,780
How much of a burden a living Nam Se-ri is to him.

205
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:19,980
I can't live up to his expectations.

206
00:13:22,690 --> 00:13:25,150
So you're going to use your body as evidence in court?

207
00:13:25,150 --> 00:13:27,820
I'm the only person on that list who survived.

208
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:28,710
I'm obligated to do so.

209
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:31,620
Even if you testify,

210
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,520
Kim Pil-soo will be watching you for the rest of your life. Do you have a plan?

211
00:13:36,650 --> 00:13:41,010
You're not going to haunt me for the rest of your life, are you?

212
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:51,560
Don't expect someone to protect you in times of trouble.

213
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,740
Because even your shadow will leave you after sunset.

214
00:13:58,450 --> 00:14:00,020
You can't even take care of your own body.

215
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:01,320
Don't talk about obligations.

216
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:02,980
Only when you have the ability there is the obligation.

217
00:14:02,980 --> 00:14:04,810
Otherwise, it's just greed and trouble

218
00:14:04,810 --> 00:14:06,360
Hurry up and go to America.

219
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:08,560
Even if I know there will be side effects,

220
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:11,090
I still think it's worth a try.

221
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:13,800
Because I think if I can't play golf,

222
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:15,880
there's no way to live anyway.

223
00:14:15,880 --> 00:14:17,230
It can't be worse than this.

224
00:14:17,230 --> 00:14:19,760
Even if there are side effects, as long as it's not me.

225
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:20,970
That's what I think.

226
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:23,510
There are many fools like me in this world.

227
00:14:23,510 --> 00:14:26,390
Even if they know it's a fire pit, they still choose to jump into it.

228
00:14:26,390 --> 00:14:28,000
Because I know very well,

229
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,540
because those foolish, selfish and desperate lives are pathetic.

230
00:14:33,850 --> 00:14:38,150
So I want to stop this drug

231
00:14:38,150 --> 00:14:39,670
when I can.

232
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,490
Who is pitying whom?

233
00:14:55,690 --> 00:14:58,840
Why have you been suffering for so long?

234
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:04,160
No, I have to get in.

235
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:25,530
I used to hate humans.

236
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:34,920
I hated the shamelessness they perform as they dislike poverty,

237
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:40,380
disease and weakness.

238
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:46,660
I hated the attitude of laughing and not caring even if

239
00:15:46,660 --> 00:15:49,760
people were burned to death in the small room of the examination hall,

240
00:15:49,760 --> 00:15:52,710
and a child was killed by his parents.

241
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:57,050
But I'm still lucky.

242
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:01,810
Because I don't have to love anyone.

243
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:27,830
But why are you different?

244
00:16:29,020 --> 00:16:33,770
Why do you always pity others and care for them?

245
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:36,350
Why do you have to shake me like that?

246
00:16:39,350 --> 00:16:42,760
That's why...

247
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:47,310
That's why there are cracks and wounds in my heart.

248
00:16:57,380 --> 00:17:01,310
What's wrong? What's wrong with you?

249
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:04,790
Are you okay?

250
00:17:20,609 --> 00:17:22,109
Didn't you say you were a god?

251
00:17:22,109 --> 00:17:23,670
Didn't you say you would live forever?

252
00:17:23,670 --> 00:17:25,470
But how could you get hurt?

253
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:30,040
Maybe I’m going to become a human.

254
00:17:30,040 --> 00:17:32,060
Become a human and get hurt.

255
00:17:32,060 --> 00:17:34,470
And then die as a human.

256
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:37,050
Isn't that what you want?

257
00:17:37,050 --> 00:17:38,810
Is that what you should say now?

258
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:45,040
I'm going to die at your hands.

259
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:46,920
It hurts like hell!

260
00:17:46,920 --> 00:17:49,140
If you don't want to die, say something!

261
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,890
What the hell is going on here?

262
00:17:53,060 --> 00:17:56,350
I got stabbed by Tae Jung-sik.

263
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,490
But it doesn't heal.

264
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,840
Han Gye-jeol, what's wrong with you?

265
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:28,220
I've been reborn for a million times.

266
00:18:28,220 --> 00:18:31,360
I'll meet the same person again.

267
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,800
I'll show my love to her again.

268
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:37,980
I will shed tears again.

269
00:18:37,980 --> 00:18:40,590
No...

270
00:18:41,830 --> 00:18:44,230
He is God.

271
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:49,380
This will never happen.

272
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:19,800
What a troublesome woman.

273
00:19:43,410 --> 00:19:51,800
I hope it won’t get any of its master's blood in this life.

274
00:20:20,290 --> 00:20:23,130
It's been a thousand years, but you haven't changed a bit.

275
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:29,620
You still remember this old face? Thank you.

276
00:20:33,690 --> 00:20:35,720
I can't believe you had to stain it with its master's blood.

277
00:20:36,910 --> 00:20:39,840
How could I forget that threat?

278
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:44,480
Why are you doing this to Seol Hui?

279
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:46,260
Did she commit a mortal sin?

280
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:48,480
You're the one who committed a capital crime.

281
00:20:49,700 --> 00:20:52,400
The tears of blood shed by that woman and your brother.

282
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:56,340
That's your punishment.

283
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,780
What did I do?

284
00:20:57,780 --> 00:21:00,950
In a distant past that you don't even remember,

285
00:21:02,140 --> 00:21:05,350
a woman who mistook your ambition for love

286
00:21:05,350 --> 00:21:08,960
broke the self-playing drum with this hairpin.

287
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:11,420
That's how a nation was destroyed.

288
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,460
The people of the fallen country could only watch

289
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,330
their loved ones dying.

290
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:21,950
Someone must be responsible for the blood and tears.

291
00:21:21,950 --> 00:21:23,540
That's fair.

292
00:21:23,540 --> 00:21:26,740
Then why not just kill me? Why do you want to touch my people?

293
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,130
You were given the chance to die.

294
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,260
You just didn't follow it.

295
00:21:33,380 --> 00:21:34,480
I...

296
00:21:35,890 --> 00:21:37,280
I love

297
00:21:38,490 --> 00:21:39,410
Dei...

298
00:21:41,050 --> 00:21:41,860
Chance?

299
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:47,020
Is dying at the hands of a loved one what you call a chance?

300
00:21:47,020 --> 00:21:50,640
You keep talking about love and compassion.

301
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:52,100
How can you be so cruel?

302
00:21:54,260 --> 00:21:58,350
You were also given the chance to pass by.

303
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:03,040
You were also given the chance in the hades to cleanse your marriage and reborn.

304
00:22:03,040 --> 00:22:06,380
But you did not follow any of the opportunities

305
00:22:08,710 --> 00:22:09,440
Didn’t you say

306
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:14,460
before Han Gye-jeol finds peace, you will never have peace either.

307
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:19,650
You are the cause of all that woman's misfortunes. You must leave.

308
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:23,750
Whether you turn into snow, rain, wind or whatever.

309
00:22:23,750 --> 00:22:26,340
Don't be entangled with each other anymore.

310
00:22:26,340 --> 00:22:27,900
Don't.

311
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:32,310
You can't do anything for them.

312
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,060
The bleed and collapse.

313
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:40,530
Is seeing the doomed destruction the only way to wake you up?

314
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:51,940
The life, the wealth, the love,

315
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:55,010
these are all the destiny you give me.

316
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,720
But now they’re in my hands.

317
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:05,460
In other words, the fate you give me is in my hands,

318
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,250
not in the hands of others.

319
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:13,990
I won't let it be tainted with its owner's blood again,

320
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:16,850
not anymore.

321
00:23:29,960 --> 00:23:32,720
Why does Han Gye-jeol suddenly want to meet me?

322
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,220
Does she know about it?

323
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:21,770
It seems that you are very anxious.

324
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,090
Of course.

325
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:26,900
Otherwise I'm not human.

326
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:30,800
But no,

327
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:32,000
absolutely no.

328
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:40,970
Just think of it as saving someone, please help me.

329
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:43,970
You'll survive, but what about me?

330
00:24:43,970 --> 00:24:45,910
I'm dying.

331
00:24:45,910 --> 00:24:48,930
Go to find Ji Su-yeon, and you won’t die.

332
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:50,900
Ji Su-yeon?

333
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,820
Why mention Dr. Ji now?

334
00:24:54,360 --> 00:24:56,290
Did you see the news

335
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:58,100
about the new drug and its side effects?

336
00:25:00,750 --> 00:25:01,790
Ah...

337
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:05,060
After thinking about it,

338
00:25:05,060 --> 00:25:08,110
they didn't replace the CT to cause a medical accident,

339
00:25:08,110 --> 00:25:11,930
but to conceal the fact that Jang Mi-sun had malignant brown cell tumor.

340
00:25:12,990 --> 00:25:15,470
The only person who can prove that Jang Mi-sun has cancer

341
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:19,650
is Dr. Ji Su-yeon who changed the CT after seeing it.

342
00:25:21,870 --> 00:25:25,210
You and Dr. Ji have the same teacher.

343
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:27,440
You might be able to contact her.

344
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:33,600
She hid it, how can she not hide it now?

345
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:37,670
Kim Pil-soo is much powerful than before.

346
00:25:37,670 --> 00:25:39,920
It's not just about the lives of one or two people.

347
00:25:39,920 --> 00:25:42,380
Maybe she has changed her mind.

348
00:25:42,380 --> 00:25:45,150
No matter what the outcome is, we have to try.

349
00:25:46,390 --> 00:25:48,440
Try...

350
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,680
It's good to try.

351
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,460
Whether using the fellowship

352
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:54,410
or beauty trick,

353
00:25:54,410 --> 00:25:56,260
I'll try my best.

354
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,260
I'll go look for her.

355
00:25:57,260 --> 00:25:58,750
Really?

356
00:25:58,750 --> 00:26:01,130
But I hope you can also try to do one thing.

357
00:26:05,040 --> 00:26:07,030
No matter what I do,

358
00:26:07,030 --> 00:26:11,930
just put up with it and pretend you don't know.

359
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:15,340
What? Should I give you a no-refusal?

360
00:26:15,340 --> 00:26:17,980
Yeah, that's it. No-refusal.

361
00:26:19,190 --> 00:26:20,660
Did you get into something again?

362
00:26:20,660 --> 00:26:22,190
Hey, tell me.

363
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:25,540
If you agree.

364
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:31,340
Okay.

365
00:26:40,630 --> 00:26:44,120
Ouch, I can’t enter my cafe, my bad life.

366
00:26:45,430 --> 00:26:48,350
Gyeong-seung will be back soon, why don't you hurry up to leave?

367
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,450
What are you doing?

368
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:55,330
Give me a cup of coffee.

369
00:26:55,330 --> 00:26:57,750
Hurry up, hurry up, go away.

370
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:58,590
What's wrong? What's wrong?

371
00:26:59,680 --> 00:27:01,550
I don't sell this awful coffee anymore.

372
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:02,600
Go somewhere else.

373
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,130
Then give me a latte. It's sweet and tasty.

374
00:27:06,150 --> 00:27:07,880
I don’t sell lattes either.

375
00:27:07,880 --> 00:27:10,380
The cows are not producing milk these days.

376
00:27:10,380 --> 00:27:11,980
Say something decent.

377
00:27:11,980 --> 00:27:13,280
What's wrong with them all of a sudden?

378
00:27:13,280 --> 00:27:14,090
What's wrong with them?

379
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,240
What kind of nonsense did you say?

380
00:27:19,430 --> 00:27:20,830
You are really...

381
00:27:20,830 --> 00:27:22,470
Did you say everything while I was gone?

382
00:27:22,470 --> 00:27:24,230
No, I didn't.

383
00:27:24,230 --> 00:27:25,630
You've crossed the line!

384
00:27:25,630 --> 00:27:27,190
What have you heard?

385
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:27,980
What?

386
00:27:27,980 --> 00:27:30,030
Dr. Han and that uncultured girl know each other.

387
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:33,430
That uncultured girl bullied and tortured Dr. Han.

388
00:27:33,430 --> 00:27:34,900
Who is that uncultured girl?

389
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:37,000
Who could it be?

390
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,590
What's her name?

391
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,340
Right, Tae Jeong-won!

392
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:43,570
Tae Jeong-won?

393
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:56,710
Wow, my brother-in-law's taste is so sophisticated.

394
00:27:56,710 --> 00:28:00,080
I thought he was just a boring old man who used Kanji a lot.

395
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:02,170
It should be old and decrepit, proud of his age and experience.

396
00:28:02,170 --> 00:28:03,330
Is that different?

397
00:28:06,330 --> 00:28:09,650
If I were dating you, I wouldn't be bored, right?

398
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:10,680
That's what everyone says so.

399
00:28:10,680 --> 00:28:13,780
They say that just looking at my face won't be boring.

400
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:16,600
So, are you here to show off your face?

401
00:28:16,600 --> 00:28:22,100
Well, it’s about your friend.

402
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,720
Friend? Who?

403
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,900
Bo-eun? Yeon?

404
00:28:25,900 --> 00:28:27,370
No, it's...

405
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:29,540
(Tae Jeong-won)

406
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,110
Just answer the phone.

407
00:28:36,630 --> 00:28:37,300
Did you find her?

408
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,890
I'm exhausted.

409
00:28:40,890 --> 00:28:43,080
I've made dozens of phone calls.

410
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,730
Hold on a second.

411
00:28:48,230 --> 00:28:49,380
I didn't order.

412
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:53,910
I feel sorry for you.

413
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:00,930
This coffee shop is wired.

414
00:29:00,930 --> 00:29:03,680
They always give me something, but it's not good.

415
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:08,060
Anyway, Dr. Ji Su-yeon hides herself very well.

416
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:10,330
No one in Korea knows where she is.

417
00:29:10,330 --> 00:29:15,390
So I called my senior in America and finally found her.

418
00:29:15,390 --> 00:29:18,040
You know, it's early in the morning over there.

419
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:23,110
Thank you so much. I'll buy you dinner.

420
00:29:23,110 --> 00:29:24,630
Forget it.

421
00:29:24,630 --> 00:29:27,050
Don't forget the no-refusal.

422
00:29:30,940 --> 00:29:32,340
Why does she always mention the right of refusal...

423
00:29:35,980 --> 00:29:37,260
What's wrong?

424
00:29:37,260 --> 00:29:41,170
You're going to have dinner together, you seem to be very close.

425
00:29:41,170 --> 00:29:44,270
Who? Tae Jeong-won? You...

426
00:29:44,270 --> 00:29:46,220
What's wrong? She seems like a nice person.

427
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:48,600
She's pretty, pampered, and smart.

428
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:51,110
Do you know Tae Jeong-won? How do you know her?

429
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:52,650
Of course I do.

430
00:29:52,650 --> 00:29:54,810
I can tell by her voice.

431
00:29:54,810 --> 00:29:56,560
I have good instincts.

432
00:29:56,560 --> 00:29:58,350
Nonsense.

433
00:29:58,350 --> 00:30:00,720
Oh, you've met her before.

434
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,820
Me? When? How is that possible? I don't think so.

435
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:07,940
You saw her in front of Professor Do's house, and you bled.

436
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,750
Blood?

437
00:30:10,820 --> 00:30:13,140
Sister, are you okay?

438
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:15,660
Who are you? Let go of my sister!

439
00:30:15,660 --> 00:30:16,770
What are you talking about?

440
00:30:18,890 --> 00:30:22,790
Oh my God! Chul, are you okay?

441
00:30:22,790 --> 00:30:24,180
You hit me right in the face. Shit!

442
00:30:24,180 --> 00:30:25,500
Your nose is bleeding.

443
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,880
What a bad luck.

444
00:30:29,670 --> 00:30:30,770
That uneducated girl?

445
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:31,460
Yes.

446
00:30:33,910 --> 00:30:36,050
Now I'm the one who has the right of refusal.

447
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:36,070
(Chul)
Now I'm the one who has the right of refusal.

448
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:36,850
(Chul)

449
00:30:54,950 --> 00:30:57,160
(Dear)

450
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:27,130
What are you doing? Are you going to fall?

451
00:31:27,130 --> 00:31:29,340
You'll catch me, right?

452
00:31:29,340 --> 00:31:32,750
No. Raising you strong is my belief.

453
00:31:32,750 --> 00:31:37,150
Then throw me away. I'm incompetent anyway.

454
00:31:37,150 --> 00:31:38,580
What's wrong with you?

455
00:31:38,580 --> 00:31:41,630
I can't even get anyone to help me.

456
00:31:41,630 --> 00:31:43,190
Who? Ji Su-yeon?

457
00:31:45,350 --> 00:31:46,450
How do you know?

458
00:31:47,510 --> 00:31:50,160
You cry and call, it is difficult not to know.

459
00:31:50,160 --> 00:31:51,580
I still have ears.

460
00:31:53,050 --> 00:31:56,140
She said that no matter how many people die, it's none of her business.

461
00:31:56,140 --> 00:31:58,610
Can she live with her conscience? How can she be so indifferent?

462
00:31:58,610 --> 00:32:00,280
How can a person behave like this?

463
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:04,170
I told you not to negotiate, but to threaten.

464
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,970
Where is she? America?

465
00:32:12,830 --> 00:32:13,820
Forget it.

466
00:32:14,950 --> 00:32:17,900
She said she'd rather die than have anything to do with Kim Pil-soo.

467
00:32:17,900 --> 00:32:20,080
It's useless to bring her back.

468
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:22,310
Whether it's about Jang Mi-sun or the side effects,

469
00:32:22,310 --> 00:32:24,970
Jeong I-deun will testify in court.

470
00:32:24,970 --> 00:32:26,390
Why are you still so concerned about it?

471
00:32:27,800 --> 00:32:30,650
Because I've been so worried.

472
00:32:32,660 --> 00:32:35,260
Can I be idle?

473
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:37,020
I have to earn food expenses, right?

474
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,180
Your food expenses

475
00:32:39,180 --> 00:32:40,280
is your faith.

476
00:32:41,990 --> 00:32:46,220
As you believe, as you expect, this is how I live.

477
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:52,600
It will pass. It will get better.

478
00:32:52,600 --> 00:32:55,040
You just have to believe it.

479
00:32:59,020 --> 00:33:02,610
Who taught you to hit on girls like that?

480
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,240
Let's go.

481
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:22,530
Jeong I-deun,

482
00:33:24,390 --> 00:33:26,160
Don't ever leave my side.

483
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:28,620
Okay.

484
00:33:48,020 --> 00:33:48,680
Il-jun.

485
00:33:54,840 --> 00:33:56,650
(Court)

486
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:21,520
Get him!

487
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,300
Mr. Jeong I-deun!

488
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,120
Once again, I let go of the hands I should have held tightly.

Quick news, around 11:00 this morning,
(Golf Pro Jung I-deun was attacked)

491
00:34:31,179 --> 00:34:33,739
golf pro Jeong I-deun was attacked.
(Golf Pro Jung I-deun was attacked)

492
00:34:33,739 --> 00:34:34,219
golf pro Jeong I-deun was attacked.

493
00:34:34,219 --> 00:34:35,679
According to reports from the scene,

494
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,830
the suspect committed a blind murder

495
00:34:37,830 --> 00:34:41,929
because he was unhappy with the court's ruling, leaving people in shock.

496
00:34:41,929 --> 00:34:44,370
In addition, a movie-like incident happened at the scene, which caused a lively discussion.

In addition, a movie-like incident happened at the scene, which caused a lively discussion.

(Superman who appeared in Seoul?)

499
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,760
A plaque that was being hung accidentally fell down the hall,

500
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,090
almost hitting a child and causing an accident.

501
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:56,489
At that moment, someone flew like an instantaneous movement to save the child.

502
00:34:56,489 --> 00:35:00,820
Witnesses at the scene said it was as if they had seen Superman.

503
00:35:00,820 --> 00:35:02,660
But this has also led many netizens to speculate

504
00:35:02,660 --> 00:35:08,580
whether this divine power is related to the recent case of frozen death.

505
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,580
I told you,

506
00:35:13,690 --> 00:35:15,900
I'm always above you.

507
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:24,100
(Operating Room)

508
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:26,740
I’m going to kill him.

509
00:35:26,740 --> 00:35:28,480
Deity.

510
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:30,260
Tell me to kill him. Please, tell me to kill him.

511
00:35:30,260 --> 00:35:32,110
Tear him up or burn him dry,

512
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,020
tell me to kill that Kim Pil-soo.

513
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:36,590
It's gonna be okay. Jeong I-deun is gonna be okay.

514
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,390
It's gonna be okay? How is it gonna be okay?

515
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:41,330
He's almost dead, and that guy is taunting me.

516
00:35:41,330 --> 00:35:44,200
Do you know how many people I've killed?

517
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,570
Killing one Kim Pil-soo won't change anything.

518
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:50,500
So, please, please tell me to kill him.

519
00:35:50,500 --> 00:35:52,870
I don't know why you need my permission.

520
00:35:54,110 --> 00:35:55,950
Is it because of me that you can't kill him,

521
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:59,520
or are you using me as an excuse not to kill him?

522
00:36:00,710 --> 00:36:01,470
I hear everything

523
00:36:02,440 --> 00:36:03,680
you said.

524
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,900
What kind of mood did you live with?

525
00:36:10,220 --> 00:36:12,390
Even hope is like a hell,

526
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,770
and you are disgusted to the extreme to see blood.

527
00:36:16,480 --> 00:36:19,500
I know how painful it would be for you to have blood on your hands again.

528
00:36:19,500 --> 00:36:21,090
So I can't turn a blind eye to it.

529
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,380
It's okay to use me as an excuse.

530
00:36:27,420 --> 00:36:29,150
Don't get anyone's blood on your hands again.

531
00:36:41,820 --> 00:36:43,620
He still needs to observed a few more days,

532
00:36:43,620 --> 00:36:45,950
but still be mentally prepared.

533
00:36:47,140 --> 00:36:48,100
Really...

534
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:50,980
To take him away?

535
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:54,070
Why?

536
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:57,230
What did he do wrong?

537
00:36:57,230 --> 00:37:00,150
You're the one who committed the crime of death.

538
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,830
The blood and tears of that woman and your brother

539
00:37:02,830 --> 00:37:05,630
are the punishment you deserve.

540
00:37:05,630 --> 00:37:06,530
It's all my fault

541
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,880
after all.

542
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:12,810
It's definitely not your fault.

543
00:37:12,810 --> 00:37:14,640
Then

544
00:37:14,640 --> 00:37:16,780
whose fault is it?

545
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:19,790
Consider it as fate.

546
00:37:19,790 --> 00:37:21,080
It's not anyone's fault.

547
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,260
Fate.

548
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:28,400
Bleeding and collapsing.

549
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:33,840
Do you have to see the doomed destruction with your own eyes to wake up?

550
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:40,510
Yes.

551
00:37:40,510 --> 00:37:41,790
I've lost.

552
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:46,650
I'll be gone in a flash and gone forever.

553
00:37:46,650 --> 00:37:51,610
Can they continue to live well?

554
00:37:53,080 --> 00:37:55,340
You can allow that, right?

555
00:38:02,450 --> 00:38:03,760
Deity.

556
00:38:26,070 --> 00:38:28,020
The wound is getting worse.

557
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:34,170
If you continue to stay here, you will really die.

558
00:38:35,900 --> 00:38:37,500
That's not bad.

559
00:38:38,950 --> 00:38:39,930
Please...

560
00:38:42,550 --> 00:38:44,040
Please go back.

561
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:49,950
I want to rest.

562
00:39:11,050 --> 00:39:13,460
-Is he okay? -Yeah.

563
00:39:13,460 --> 00:39:15,020
I can treat him.

564
00:39:18,810 --> 00:39:20,490
Are you an idiot?

565
00:39:20,490 --> 00:39:22,950
No man wants to be seen like that.

566
00:39:22,950 --> 00:39:24,310
Is it that bad?

567
00:39:28,310 --> 00:39:29,990
His wound doesn't heal,

568
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:34,140
it’s like lifeless dead wood.

569
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:38,580
This world is not a place for the gods of the underworld, so

570
00:39:39,730 --> 00:39:44,350
he's like a wrongly transplanted tree that dies slowly.

571
00:39:45,910 --> 00:39:47,700
Isn't he always here?

572
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:51,760
But why will he suddenly die?

573
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,570
Do you think the god of the underworld can always stay in this world?

574
00:39:57,570 --> 00:40:02,290
He told me that he was punished in this world.

575
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:07,480
Yes, but he only stays 99 days in this world once

576
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,130
every 99 years.

577
00:40:16,010 --> 00:40:17,100
Then...

578
00:40:18,820 --> 00:40:20,810
The last time you said disappear...

579
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:24,460
It’s time to go back to the underworld, but he said he wanted to stay.

580
00:40:24,460 --> 00:40:28,640
That againsts the will of the God who made him a guide to the dead.

581
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:33,200
Because he didn't listen, he suffered all this pain.

582
00:40:35,010 --> 00:40:37,730
The Creator will not spare him.

583
00:40:37,730 --> 00:40:39,880
That wound is just a warning.

584
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:45,390
Even if he is immediately struck by lightning, it is not strange.

585
00:40:45,390 --> 00:40:46,350
Is he...

586
00:40:48,970 --> 00:40:51,160
Is he really going to die?

587
00:40:55,250 --> 00:40:57,180
I've been serving him for a thousand years,

588
00:40:58,350 --> 00:41:00,140
but it's the first time I've seen him with a wound.

589
00:41:01,390 --> 00:41:03,700
He's got a wound,

590
00:41:03,700 --> 00:41:04,640
is he far from death?

591
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:06,790
Maybe he won't die.

592
00:41:07,850 --> 00:41:10,920
Maybe he can stay here and live happily.

593
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,790
We can have hope.

594
00:41:12,790 --> 00:41:15,610
Your casual hope

595
00:41:15,610 --> 00:41:17,590
is betting all the sacrifices for Deity.

596
00:41:17,590 --> 00:41:18,390
Are you so cruel...

597
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:25,120
That you can just watch him die?

598
00:41:32,470 --> 00:41:33,830
Can I ask you one thing?

599
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:37,540
Please,

600
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:43,960
order Lord Deity to return to the underworld.

601
00:41:44,910 --> 00:41:47,030
I know you don't want him to leave,

602
00:41:47,190 --> 00:41:50,500
and I know he doesn't want to leave himself, but,

603
00:41:52,470 --> 00:41:55,260
just once.

604
00:41:55,840 --> 00:41:59,010
Please order him to go back.

605
00:42:01,730 --> 00:42:05,700
Whenever I send someone away,

606
00:42:06,340 --> 00:42:08,380
I always think of

607
00:42:09,790 --> 00:42:12,780
the paper I wrote for him,

608
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:14,970
the kimchi I made for him,

609
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:18,240
and the designer purse I bought for him.

610
00:42:20,100 --> 00:42:23,040
I always give more than what I receive. So I feel so aggrieved.

611
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:28,870
I'm afraid I'll lose more than I gain, so I don't put it down easily.

612
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,710
But I've gotten so much

613
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,470
from you.

614
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,620
So I can't think of an excuse to keep you.

615
00:43:12,820 --> 00:43:15,230
It's time to wake up.

616
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,900
(Pilseong Bio goes public tomorrow! Is the succession trend of Pilseong considerable?)

617
00:43:23,720 --> 00:43:25,590
What are you looking at so seriously?

618
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:29,580
It's said that the devil is very hardworking,

619
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:32,150
and seems to be very capable.

620
00:43:34,820 --> 00:43:38,500
It’s said that capitalism is the devil's stone mill

621
00:43:39,790 --> 00:43:43,010
that crushes human nature into fine powder.

622
00:43:43,530 --> 00:43:47,200
In the end, the master of the stone mill will win.

623
00:43:48,920 --> 00:43:53,370
There are only two days left. Can we win before that?

624
00:43:53,570 --> 00:43:57,530
Damn Creator, if you want me to wake up, you should do it sooner!

625
00:43:57,830 --> 00:44:01,290
Two days?

626
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:05,580
Didn't you know that I only have two days left?

627
00:44:06,150 --> 00:44:07,770
Are you leaving?

628
00:44:11,640 --> 00:44:15,470
Ok Shin, come and eat.

629
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:24,660
What's wrong with him?

630
00:44:25,180 --> 00:44:26,800
I don't know.

631
00:44:27,020 --> 00:44:29,740
Does he need to be beaten again to get his energy up?

632
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:33,730
Why do I have to quit the freezing death case?

633
00:44:33,930 --> 00:44:36,250
Why did you send me back to Yeongpo?

634
00:44:36,580 --> 00:44:38,910
Don't you know that you have no right to investigate cases about your relatives?

635
00:44:39,110 --> 00:44:40,670
Who are my relatives? Who?

636
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:43,110
Isn't Do Jin-woo your brother-in-law?

637
00:44:43,330 --> 00:44:44,690
What does Do Jin-woo have to do with it?

638
00:44:44,910 --> 00:44:46,220
What's wrong with him?

639
00:44:46,410 --> 00:44:49,400
Didn't you see the news? They said Do Jin-woo can move instantly.

640
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:51,930
Didn't you say that before?

641
00:44:52,110 --> 00:44:54,600
The murderer is using superpower. The murderer can move instantly.

642
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:57,300
Do Jin-woo is really using his superpower.

643
00:44:57,590 --> 00:44:59,970
What's wrong? You've changed your mind as he becomes your brother-in-law?

644
00:45:00,200 --> 00:45:02,030
It's just unfounded gossip.

645
00:45:02,220 --> 00:45:05,660
The police officer who was there said he saw someone suddenly disappear.

646
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:10,120
Tae Jung-sik has been claiming that Do Jin-woo can move instantly.

647
00:45:10,120 --> 00:45:12,430
He said he was a monster who wouldn't die even being stabbed with a knife.

648
00:45:12,620 --> 00:45:14,500
Who said I was a monster?

649
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:20,040
I'll charge you with spreading gossip.

650
00:45:20,210 --> 00:45:22,600
Tae Jung-sik said that.

651
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:26,260
You believe the words of the criminal but not the words of the victim, right?

652
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,020
What's wrong with you? Are you really going to fight with them?

653
00:45:30,180 --> 00:45:33,210
Even if you don't believe me, you'll believe me when you see my body.

654
00:45:34,140 --> 00:45:35,580
See?

655
00:45:35,790 --> 00:45:37,760
This is the place where Tae Jung-sik poked me.

656
00:45:38,280 --> 00:45:40,190
You come to confirm it.

657
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:42,520
Forget it. Forget it.

658
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,860
I told you, how can it be like that?

659
00:45:47,400 --> 00:45:50,140
It’s all done by Kim Pil-soo.

660
00:45:50,330 --> 00:45:52,660
But I’m the only one who was kicked out in the end? Why?

661
00:45:52,850 --> 00:45:54,600
I can’t see myself being bullied like this.

662
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:54,740
((Co.) Pilseong Bio)
I can’t see myself being bullied like this.

663
00:45:54,740 --> 00:45:54,940
((Co.) Pilseong Bio)

664
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,480
Now let’s start the ceremony to commemorate the listing of Pilseong Bio Co. Ltd.
((Co.) Pilseong Bio)

665
00:45:59,480 --> 00:46:02,770
((Co.) Pilseong Bio)

666
00:46:08,790 --> 00:46:10,000
Let’s check the results together.

667
00:46:11,020 --> 00:46:12,660
(Opening Confirmation)

668
00:46:13,990 --> 00:46:15,470
Five.

669
00:46:15,470 --> 00:46:17,100
Four.

670
00:46:17,100 --> 00:46:18,710
Three.

671
00:46:18,710 --> 00:46:20,060
Two.

672
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:21,140
One.

673
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:22,970
(Good luck with the listing of Kostak (Co.) Pilseong Bio)

674
00:46:22,970 --> 00:46:24,140
Well, congratulations.
(Good luck with the listing of Kostak (Co.) Pilseong Bio)

675
00:46:24,140 --> 00:46:28,650
The initial price of Pilseong Bio is set at 76,000 won.

676
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:34,210
President Kim Pil-soo.

677
00:46:34,420 --> 00:46:37,260
Thank you. Thank you very much.

678
00:46:43,530 --> 00:46:45,350
President Kim, congratulations.

679
00:46:45,350 --> 00:46:47,690
Congratulations. You’ve done quite a great job.

680
00:46:47,910 --> 00:46:51,810
-Congratulations, congratulations. -Who are you?

681
00:46:51,810 --> 00:46:52,910
Me?

682
00:46:53,290 --> 00:46:55,690
I’m a criminal detective in Korea.

683
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,120
I’m here to warn you not to spread rumors.

684
00:46:59,120 --> 00:47:01,810
Do Jin-woo can move instantly and won’t get hurt.

685
00:47:01,810 --> 00:47:03,580
Those are all rumors spread by you.

686
00:47:03,580 --> 00:47:04,900
Please, stop it and leave immediately.

687
00:47:04,900 --> 00:47:05,640
Hey, security guard.

688
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:06,650
That’s alright.

689
00:47:06,650 --> 00:47:10,860
Do Jin-woo’s got a big wound here. We all saw it.

690
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:13,140
Why did you spread those rumors?

691
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,730
Wound?

692
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:20,110
Yeah, I heard Tae Jung-sik poked him.

693
00:47:20,110 --> 00:47:21,570
Don’t you know that?

694
00:47:22,400 --> 00:47:24,830
Just go and enjoy your last supper.

695
00:47:24,830 --> 00:47:27,890
Because as long as Do Jin-woo shows conclusive evidence,

696
00:47:27,890 --> 00:47:30,150
you will be done.

697
00:47:31,270 --> 00:47:33,430
-Hurry up and get out. -Sorry.

698
00:47:33,640 --> 00:47:35,600
We’re lea... leaving.

699
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:43,690
You sent a good message to Kim Pil-soo, didn’t you?

700
00:47:43,690 --> 00:47:46,290
Yes. I told him exactly where the wound is.

701
00:47:46,290 --> 00:47:48,720
I even brought the unrelated criminal detective Kim there.

702
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,710
He should believe me.

703
00:47:50,710 --> 00:47:53,590
Alas, poor criminal detective Kim.

704
00:47:53,590 --> 00:47:55,630
He is probably going to be punished with me.

705
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:59,070
People have to be punished occasionally when they’re alive.

706
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:02,650
Do you have to do that?

707
00:48:06,860 --> 00:48:10,120
Because I just found out about the use of this thing.

708
00:48:14,410 --> 00:48:16,670
My sister will be scared.

709
00:48:18,310 --> 00:48:21,390
If things end well, brother-in-law, explain it to her.

710
00:48:21,670 --> 00:48:22,990
Brother-in-law, you should tell her yourself.

711
00:48:23,170 --> 00:48:25,460
Why will she learn it through others? It’s so annoying.

712
00:48:25,730 --> 00:48:26,830
That’s what I want. Make her angry.

713
00:48:27,850 --> 00:48:28,810
What?

714
00:48:28,810 --> 00:48:32,430
Angry, disappointed and desperate. Feelings have to be weakened like this.

715
00:48:33,300 --> 00:48:35,520
So I can become a passer-by who is meaningless to her.

716
00:48:37,430 --> 00:48:39,220
Because I want to be a passer-by

717
00:48:39,420 --> 00:48:45,370
who has nothing worth remembering and has nothing to do with her.

718
00:49:07,820 --> 00:49:11,380
Not anyone can be such a passer-by.

719
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:24,590
♫Like a secret, as the seasons pass♫

720
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:31,920
♫Wounds gradually heal♫

721
00:49:34,790 --> 00:49:38,620
♫My love♫

722

♫my love♫

♫becomes a poem♫

724
00:50:10,030 --> 00:50:12,560
What’s wrong? Why don’t you keep singing?

725
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:14,550
It sounds good.

726
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,010
There should be an end to it.

727
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:20,480
I think this is almost the time.

728
00:50:21,630 --> 00:50:22,750
What?

729
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:24,550
To realize your mother’s wish.

730
00:50:26,230 --> 00:50:27,370
My mom?

731
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:30,880
I met your mother in the distant underworld.

732
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:33,650
I was very lonely that day.

733
00:50:34,080 --> 00:50:36,420
The song just comforted me.

734
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:40,450
So I made the mistake of listening to the wishes of the dead.

735
00:50:43,270 --> 00:50:49,550
She said, if I meet you, I have to listen to you,

736
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,750
for the mother who has done nothing for you.

737
00:50:52,920 --> 00:50:57,820
Even if my mother was there, she only worried about me.

738
00:51:00,610 --> 00:51:03,020
She is my dear mother.

739
00:51:03,360 --> 00:51:06,910
I thought even if I would meet you, it would be in the underworld.

740
00:51:07,850 --> 00:51:11,950
I never dreamed that I would meet you in the world and obey you.

741
00:51:12,150 --> 00:51:13,310
Obey me?

742
00:51:15,610 --> 00:51:17,740
I am human. You are a God.

743
00:51:17,940 --> 00:51:20,420
There is no God who obeys human beings.

744
00:51:20,630 --> 00:51:22,680
That’s the promise of God.

745
00:51:22,890 --> 00:51:24,700
To realize impossible things.

746
00:51:25,690 --> 00:51:27,190
How is that possible?

747
00:51:27,370 --> 00:51:29,520
Think about it yourself.

748
00:51:29,710 --> 00:51:32,170
You have to continue to stir. Stir.

749
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:33,640
Don’t order me.

750
00:51:33,860 --> 00:51:34,660
Good job. Good job.

751
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:36,870
I’m not your slave.

752
00:51:37,060 --> 00:51:38,670
Your words made me to work for you.

753
00:51:38,670 --> 00:51:41,100
Grab Bak Chung-seong’s feet gently with your hands.

754
00:51:41,100 --> 00:51:43,570
Okay, pull his feet gently.

755
00:51:44,940 --> 00:51:47,920
Your words made me to save a person.

756
00:51:48,500 --> 00:51:49,840
Stop.

757
00:51:51,550 --> 00:51:53,450
Professor Do.

758
00:51:53,630 --> 00:51:55,580
Are you crazy? Let go quickly.

759
00:51:55,780 --> 00:52:01,320
And your words even made me to let go of a bad guy.

760
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:07,220
Otherwise, how could I beg you to let me kill Kim Pil-soo?

761
00:52:07,470 --> 00:52:09,530
With my temper, do you think it was possible?

762
00:52:11,890 --> 00:52:15,940
I obeyed you and fell in love with you finally.

763
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:19,100
Fell in love with me?

764
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,840
There is no woman in the world who orders God casually.

765
00:52:22,270 --> 00:52:24,010
Because I met this kind of woman for the first time,

766
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,940
I felt new and curious.

767
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:30,160
Because I had that kind of feeling for the first time,

768
00:52:31,070 --> 00:52:33,310
I thought it was love.

769
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:39,140
It’s an illusion?

770
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:47,870
I have started to feel tired and bored.

771
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,110
If things go on like this, we can’t be together forever.

772
00:53:02,060 --> 00:53:04,370
You finally...

773
00:53:04,680 --> 00:53:06,230
Let’s break up.

774
00:53:08,420 --> 00:53:10,520
Made that decision.

775
00:53:13,640 --> 00:53:15,180
That’s really great.

776
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:18,200
I have told you from the beginning,

777
00:53:18,370 --> 00:53:20,960
the love in your eyes is terrifying.

778
00:53:23,100 --> 00:53:25,350
So don’t be attached to me anymore.

779
00:53:25,540 --> 00:53:29,450
I’m afraid you’ll find me out and make me your slave again.

780
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:32,300
If we meet occasionally, pretend that you don’t know me.

781
00:53:32,430 --> 00:53:33,750
No.

782
00:53:36,470 --> 00:53:38,330
Whether it’s snow or rain or wind,

783
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:44,110
we have nothing to do with each other in any way.

784
00:53:58,840 --> 00:53:59,990
Thank you.

785
00:54:00,980 --> 00:54:03,670
For what? For breaking up with you?

786
00:54:04,460 --> 00:54:07,150
Because you told me that I’m special.

787
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:12,940
I never liked that I was too ordinary.

788
00:54:14,450 --> 00:54:18,780
But now I find that I’m too special.

789
00:54:19,540 --> 00:54:23,580
Who can order God casually in the world?

790
00:54:24,570 --> 00:54:27,870
Who can terrify God in the world?

791
00:54:29,150 --> 00:54:32,520
Thank you for telling me how special I’m.

792
00:54:34,060 --> 00:54:37,590
Thanks to you, I can pretend to be great in the future.

793
00:54:39,280 --> 00:54:41,780
Don’t pretend to be kind.

794
00:54:41,780 --> 00:54:44,930
Why don’t you say what you want to say? Why do you still pretend to be kind?

795
00:54:44,930 --> 00:54:46,880
Do you think that will make you cooler?

796
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:51,340
Or do you want me to remember how nice you are for the rest of my life?

797
00:54:54,490 --> 00:54:56,950
Misunderstanding is your specialty?

798
00:54:56,950 --> 00:55:00,980
Misunderstood love. Also misunderstood breaking up?

799
00:55:00,980 --> 00:55:05,200
I am now very serious breaking up with you.

800
00:55:09,460 --> 00:55:13,260
I even tempt God. Who else can’t I tempt?

801
00:55:13,260 --> 00:55:16,970
Because I’m very special, I won’t hesitate to do that.

802
00:55:20,220 --> 00:55:23,160
Love can be forgotten with a new love.

803
00:55:23,160 --> 00:55:26,030
This is the basic process of breaking up.

804
00:55:27,070 --> 00:55:32,510
I am now dumping or being dumped?

805
00:55:32,510 --> 00:55:34,190
Basic process?

806
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:36,030
Then obey it.

807
00:55:38,120 --> 00:55:39,880
I have a favor to ask you.

808
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:41,450
Let me meet Kim Pil-soo.

809
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:45,250
Why meet him?

810
00:55:45,250 --> 00:55:46,750
I won’t kill him,

811
00:55:46,750 --> 00:55:49,410
but I can’t be controlled by him either.

812
00:55:50,350 --> 00:55:52,050
I have a secret weapon.

813
00:55:56,110 --> 00:56:00,430
Then I have a favor to ask you too.

814
00:56:02,250 --> 00:56:03,840
What’s that?

815
00:56:05,420 --> 00:56:06,930
Tonight...

816
00:56:08,100 --> 00:56:09,890
Let’s be together.

817
00:56:10,810 --> 00:56:13,150
Tonight...

818
00:56:13,150 --> 00:56:14,470
So suddenly?

819
00:56:16,060 --> 00:56:18,020
What on earth do you want?

820
00:56:21,120 --> 00:56:22,470
Dream...

821
00:56:48,500 --> 00:56:51,440
I want an ordinary wedding.

822
00:56:51,440 --> 00:56:56,660
Want to welcome the ordinary morning... Seol Hui’s dream.

823
00:57:10,370 --> 00:57:11,780
Is being a princess your dream?

824
00:57:13,600 --> 00:57:16,820
Maybe I was a princess in my previous life.

825
00:57:16,820 --> 00:57:18,460
I really want to wear this.

826
00:57:25,540 --> 00:57:28,690
It seems that the princess in your country has to roast crucian carp cake.

827
00:57:28,690 --> 00:57:31,370
Seasons are remembered by taste.

828
00:57:31,370 --> 00:57:33,700
In winter, of course, it’s crucian carp cake.

829
00:57:33,700 --> 00:57:35,550
I told you not to remember.

830
00:57:35,550 --> 00:57:37,760
Even if we pass by, pretend that we don’t know each other and walk directly.

831
00:57:37,760 --> 00:57:39,510
Let’s talk about it after eating.

832
00:57:45,200 --> 00:57:46,820
It tastes good.

833
00:57:46,820 --> 00:57:48,060
Yummy.

834
00:57:54,770 --> 00:57:59,890
Remember this winter night... Full of sweet aroma.

835
00:58:01,580 --> 00:58:07,430
Because it will support you to walk alone to the distance...

836
00:58:07,430 --> 00:58:09,370
The struggle of life.

837
00:59:03,960 --> 00:59:06,870
The season passed too quickly.

838
00:59:08,610 --> 00:59:13,090
We failed to walk together in the season,

839
00:59:13,090 --> 00:59:18,350
and to feel the season together.

840
00:59:23,220 --> 00:59:25,590
We ignored the season

841
00:59:29,710 --> 00:59:31,760
and led our lives.

842
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:37,150
(Deity)

843
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:51,140
It may not be suitable for you.

844
00:59:54,920 --> 00:59:58,430
If it is a more expensive place,

845
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:02,810
a more noble

846
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,350
and shining place,

847
01:00:12,840 --> 01:00:16,780
then will you stay longer?

848
01:00:16,780 --> 01:00:22,120
(Deity)

849
01:00:23,830 --> 01:00:26,530
My feelings were not cheap

850
01:00:29,720 --> 01:00:32,000
and were not simple.

851
01:00:35,250 --> 01:00:37,110
They were infinite.

852
01:00:41,510 --> 01:00:43,830
It seems that these are not enough.

853
01:01:03,880 --> 01:01:09,400
(Deity)

854
01:01:23,550 --> 01:01:26,180
Stop.

855
01:01:26,180 --> 01:01:28,200
How long are you gonna keep this up?

856
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:33,770
Once again.

857
01:01:33,770 --> 01:01:35,790
What?

858
01:01:36,670 --> 01:01:39,830
It was my first time.

859
01:01:39,830 --> 01:01:41,990
First time in my life.

860
01:01:41,990 --> 01:01:44,410
But I lost it that way.

861
01:01:44,410 --> 01:01:47,000
I can’t even remember whether it touched my lips or teeth.

862
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,230
Just pretend it didn’t happen and do it again.

863
01:01:49,230 --> 01:01:50,730
It’s really sad.

864
01:01:50,730 --> 01:01:53,800
We just accidentally touched, touched our lips.

865
01:01:53,800 --> 01:01:55,690
Do you think it was your first kiss now?

866
01:01:55,690 --> 01:01:57,320
Annoying...

867
01:01:57,320 --> 01:01:59,690
Ok Shin.

868
01:01:59,690 --> 01:02:01,300
Ouch, Ok Shin.

869
01:02:01,300 --> 01:02:03,990
Hey, well, ouch.

870
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:05,140
Alright.

871
01:02:05,140 --> 01:02:07,580
Alright, alright.

872
01:02:07,580 --> 01:02:11,280
First kiss. First hug and first sex.

873
01:02:11,280 --> 01:02:12,710
You can have them again later.

874
01:02:12,710 --> 01:02:14,560
-Alright. -Forget it.

875
01:02:14,560 --> 01:02:16,140
Who wants to have sex with you?

876
01:02:16,140 --> 01:02:17,530
Forget it.

877
01:02:17,530 --> 01:02:19,920
Get out. Who told you to do it with me?

878
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:22,120
With others. Do it with others...

879
01:02:22,120 --> 01:02:23,740
Crazy man...

880
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:25,550
Well, well.

881
01:02:25,550 --> 01:02:28,830
You’ve been single for thousand years. Who else can you do it with?

882
01:02:28,830 --> 01:02:30,320
Oh my god.

883
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:32,950
You’re ugly. And now... Poor.

884
01:02:36,150 --> 01:02:39,600
Hey, let’s not talk about appearance. Money is a different thing.

885
01:02:39,600 --> 01:02:41,230
All I have left is money.

886
01:02:43,210 --> 01:02:44,710
Hey.

887
01:02:44,710 --> 01:02:46,510
-Don’t you know? -What?

888
01:02:46,510 --> 01:02:49,500
The money is not yours anymore.

889
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,050
It’s so cold.

890
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:53,590
There is a kind of foreboding in my heart.

891
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,960
The news has been reporting this all day.

892
01:02:55,960 --> 01:02:57,360
That’s real.

893
01:02:57,360 --> 01:02:58,980
Oh, it’s broadcasting now. Watch this.

894
01:02:58,980 --> 01:03:00,470
As for the questions I raised,

895
01:03:00,470 --> 01:03:01,290
many people think

896
01:03:01,290 --> 01:03:03,340
this is a kind of foreshadowing for the acquisition of Pilseong Bio.

897
01:03:03,340 --> 01:03:04,660
So here I want to make it clear that

898
01:03:04,660 --> 01:03:05,090
(Do Jin-woo, the heir of the Bulhwa Company, held an emergency press conference)
So here I want to make it clear that

899
01:03:05,090 --> 01:03:06,770
Bulhwa Company
(Do Jin-woo, the heir of the Bulhwa Company, held an emergency press conference)

900
01:03:06,770 --> 01:03:10,220
is to provide medical support to children and vulnerable groups
(Do Jin-woo, the heir of the Bulhwa Company, held an emergency press conference)

901
01:03:10,220 --> 01:03:11,270
-as well as the victims of medical accidents. -No, no.

-as well as the victims of medical accidents. -No, no.

903
01:03:13,340 --> 01:03:16,140
We’ll give a trillion won back to society.

904
01:03:18,490 --> 01:03:19,490
I’m going to kill you!

905
01:03:19,490 --> 01:03:22,820
I’m going to kill Deity, the bastard!

906
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,530
He’ll die anyway.

907
01:03:27,530 --> 01:03:29,570
By 9:09 tonight,

908
01:03:29,570 --> 01:03:32,060
the gate of the underworld will open.

909
01:03:32,060 --> 01:03:33,680
He’ll die before that.

910
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:35,650
I’ll kill him before he leaves.

911
01:03:37,220 --> 01:03:38,710
Who will die?

912
01:03:43,180 --> 01:03:44,500
She doesn’t know yet?

913
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,890
She might not know it’s today.

914
01:03:47,410 --> 01:03:51,300
Ok Shin... I’m going to kill Ok Shin.

915
01:03:51,300 --> 01:03:54,830
Go to hell. Go to hell. Go to hell.

916
01:03:58,690 --> 01:04:00,850
By the way, honey, are you going out?

917
01:04:00,850 --> 01:04:05,650
I feel depressed. I want to go out and buy some clothes for my brother.

918
01:04:05,650 --> 01:04:09,440
I heard that he would go out on a task tonight. It’s really cold.

919

(Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency)

920
01:04:13,840 --> 01:04:17,010
How can a guy perform a task after being punished?

921
01:04:17,010 --> 01:04:17,860
Punished?

922
01:04:17,860 --> 01:04:19,650
That crazy man.

923
01:04:19,650 --> 01:04:24,190
No. Why did he go to Kim Pil-soo’s place and make a mess?

924
01:04:24,190 --> 01:04:25,660
I went after him to stop him from making trouble.

925
01:04:25,660 --> 01:04:27,120
Now I’m also punished.

926
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:29,170
Ah, what crime did I commit?

927
01:04:29,170 --> 01:04:31,520
He went to find Kim Pil-soo and made a mess?

928
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:33,360
Why?

929
01:04:33,360 --> 01:04:34,520
For Tae Jung-sik?

930
01:04:34,520 --> 01:04:37,220
For Do Jin-woo. Do Jin-woo.

931
01:04:37,220 --> 01:04:39,410
He said he wanted to help him clear his name.

932
01:04:39,410 --> 01:04:42,430
So he found Kim Pil-soo and made a mess. No.

933
01:04:42,430 --> 01:04:45,330
What if there is a wound on Do Jin-woo’s chest?

934
01:04:45,330 --> 01:04:47,790
What does this have to do with Kim Pil-soo?

935
01:04:47,790 --> 01:04:50,080
That...

936
01:04:50,080 --> 01:04:52,520
Wait. Wait a moment.

937
01:04:52,520 --> 01:04:53,790
You said he...

938
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:55,800
What did he tell Kim Pil-soo?

939
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:01,150
Isn’t there a wound on Do Jin-woo’s chest? Wound.

940
01:05:01,150 --> 01:05:02,670
No, by the way,

941
01:05:02,670 --> 01:05:05,000
the wound is quite severe.

I’ve served him for thousand years.
(Trustworthy police officers, Safe country)

945

I’ve served him for thousand years.

946
01:05:11,300 --> 01:05:13,870
But this is the first time I see wound on his body.

947
01:05:13,870 --> 01:05:16,910
Now that he has a wound, can he be alive?

948
01:05:16,910 --> 01:05:18,420
I have a favor to ask you.

949
01:05:18,420 --> 01:05:20,300
Let me meet Kim Pil-soo.

950
01:05:20,300 --> 01:05:21,910
What do you want to do after meeting him?

951
01:05:21,910 --> 01:05:23,370
I won’t kill him,

952
01:05:23,370 --> 01:05:26,960
but I can’t be controlled by him either.

953
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,690
Because I have a secret weapon.

954
01:05:30,010 --> 01:05:34,070
It’s better to let him kill Kim Pil-soo.

955
01:05:34,070 --> 01:05:36,320
It’s better to let you kill him yourself.

956

I have lived ten thousand times,

957

975
01:06:57,160 --> 01:07:00,660
And you’ll be released quietly after a few years.

976
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:01,900
Why should I see this happen?

977
01:07:09,910 --> 01:07:11,490
Kill you and all this will be over.

978
01:07:35,470 --> 01:07:39,460
If you take way his morning this time,

979
01:07:39,460 --> 01:07:43,970
I will... Again take away yours.

980
01:07:57,770 --> 01:08:02,810
It won’t be stained with its owner’s blood again.

981
01:08:29,359 --> 01:08:32,600
I... Killed God.

982
01:08:32,600 --> 01:08:35,950
I killed God.

983
01:08:40,140 --> 01:08:43,640
Then you...

984
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,600
Become a murder.

985
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:46,859
What?

986
01:10:04,590 --> 01:10:08,780
(Next episode preview)

987
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:11,700
Come back, Deity, please come back.

988
01:10:11,700 --> 01:10:13,360
I already died.

989
01:10:13,360 --> 01:10:14,970
Then let’s die together.

990
01:10:14,970 --> 01:10:16,460
Do you want me to kill you myself

991
01:10:16,460 --> 01:10:18,550
and wander in the hell forever?

992
01:10:18,550 --> 01:10:20,030
Then what about me?

993
01:10:20,030 --> 01:10:23,270
How can I live without you?

994
01:10:23,270 --> 01:10:24,430
You have to live.

995
01:10:24,430 --> 01:10:26,510
And you have to be happy.

996
01:10:26,510 --> 01:10:28,720
If we’ll meet again one day,

997
01:10:28,720 --> 01:10:30,400
treat thousand years as a day.

998
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:32,170
I love you.

999
01:10:32,170 --> 01:10:34,910
Han Gye-jeol, please remember me.
