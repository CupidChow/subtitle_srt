00:00:00,890 --> 00:00:02,540
(Episode 3)

2
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:09,160
Are you Seol Hui?
(Due to the presence of Chinese characters in the drama, the name " Seol Hui " is changed to " Seol Hui " from this episode.)

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:10,400
Are you Seol Hui?

4
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,370
Who is Seol Hui?

5
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:16,059
I don't know either.

6
00:00:16,059 --> 00:00:17,110
What?

7
00:00:17,110 --> 00:00:21,710
Name, appearance, character, I don’t remember anything.

8
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:25,150
All I know is the name engraved on the ring,

9
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:28,950
and the mood she has been in my heart for a long time.

10
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:30,690
Seol Hui is the source of my misery and pain,

11
00:00:30,770 --> 00:00:32,430
but my only salvation.

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,350
Professor, how can I know someone you don't know?

13
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:35,780
Don't be so perfunctory with me.

14
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:37,710
Take a closer look at this.

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,570
Don't you feel anything when you see this ring?

16
00:00:39,570 --> 00:00:40,820
Ah, this is my ring.

17
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,910
which finally came back to my hands after wandering for a long time.

18
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:44,340
Don't you feel this joy of losing something and getting it back?

19
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,550
Only the anger of not knowing how much longer to listen to your nonsense.

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:49,100
Don't be so casual.

21
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:50,540
This is a big matter of my life.

22
00:00:50,540 --> 00:00:53,070
You're so precious about your life,

23
00:00:53,070 --> 00:00:55,650
but you're joking about other people's lives, aren't you?

24
00:00:55,650 --> 00:00:57,800
Oh, so that's it!

25
00:00:57,800 --> 00:00:58,670
Fine.

26
00:00:58,670 --> 00:01:00,580
Because I was too honest and caused your plan to fall through.

27
00:01:00,580 --> 00:01:01,720
If you feel very aggrieved,

28
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,460
then I'll compensate you.

29
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:03,350
Do you want money, or do you want a hospital?

30
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,120
Just ask.

31
00:01:04,120 --> 00:01:07,690
First of all, you go to the disciplinary commissioners to clarify or explain,

32
00:01:07,690 --> 00:01:10,850
do not let them create a rumor that I encouraged you to lie.

33
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:12,660
I have a very short time to stay in the world,

34
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:13,910
so I don't have time to waste on this crap all the time.

35
00:01:13,910 --> 00:01:15,670
Just take the money and let the matter go.

36
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:17,190
How can you be so hard to listen to others?

37
00:01:17,190 --> 00:01:18,950
How do you manage to talk to yourself in this situation?

38
00:01:18,950 --> 00:01:20,220
That's the nature of human beings,

39
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,200
only know to say what they want to say,

40
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,150
but can't listen to what others say.

41
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,370
Then take this opportunity to practice listening to others!

42
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:25,620
Do you think you can go back to work at that hospital

43
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,200
if you clear up the rumors?

44
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:29,490
It's a bad place to work.

45
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:31,020
It's your grave at best.

46
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:32,210
You'll only die faster if you go back.

47
00:01:32,210 --> 00:01:33,289
Are you so eager to go back and die?

48
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:34,450
Why are you so reluctant?

49
00:01:34,450 --> 00:01:36,530
How can I miss it?

50
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:39,650
I hate that hospital and those people.

51
00:01:39,650 --> 00:01:41,490
They’re awful.

52
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:42,720
But...

53
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:43,670
I can't let people say I'm a traitor,

54
00:01:43,670 --> 00:01:45,960
and I can't let them think I'm a liar.

55
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:48,120
The trouble you caused should be solved by you.

56
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,410
This is the biggest compensation for me.

57
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:51,800
Okay, okay.

58
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,229
I will make it up to you.

59
00:01:53,229 --> 00:01:54,710
But first I'll ask you if you know this ring.

60
00:01:54,710 --> 00:01:55,680
Why don't you answer me?

61
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,310
I don't know.

62
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,030
Really?

63
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:59,330
I’ll say I don't know even if I do.

64
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,420
What is this nonsense.

65
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:01,380
I don't care about the ring,

66
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,910
I don't want to have anything to do with you, Professor.

67
00:02:03,910 --> 00:02:05,410
In retrospect,

68
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:07,650
I've been unlucky since I met you, Professor.

69
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:09,500
What did you say?

70
00:02:09,500 --> 00:02:10,770
My grave.

71
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:15,350
That’s right, Professor, you are my grave.

72
00:02:15,350 --> 00:02:17,360
I don't have any feelings anyway,

73
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,480
so it's like a grave to me.

74
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:27,950
What did you say?

75
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,120
Say it again.

76
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,620
My... my grave.

77
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,770
Stop!

78
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:09,910
What are you doing?

79
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:11,100
What are you doing?

80
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:12,230
How can you reject me?

81
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:17,640
Professor, do you think you are Eros,

82
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,200
and that women will fall for you as soon as you touch them?

83
00:03:23,020 --> 00:03:24,780
Really speechless.

84
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,900
What exactly do you think I am?

85
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:31,380
How can you compare me to a character like Eros?

86
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:32,650
I'm warning you.

87
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:35,130
Don't ever appear in front of me again.

88
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,030
If you dare to appear in front of me again,

89
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:39,220
I'll show you that there are bones in this place.

90
00:03:39,220 --> 00:03:42,040
And let you can remember where all 206 bones are in the human body.

91
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,250
No.

92
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,550
At least I have to be around you to know if you're Seol Hui.

93
00:03:47,550 --> 00:03:49,770
Do you want to start with the first spine to start our lesson?

94
00:03:49,770 --> 00:03:52,340
Why do you make it sound so hard to understand?

95
00:03:52,340 --> 00:03:55,260
Did you say you didn't want to understand or did you understand?

96
00:03:55,260 --> 00:03:56,110
Yes, I did.

97
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:57,210
It's simple.

98
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:58,340
Easy to understand.

99
00:04:12,620 --> 00:04:15,510
The woman whose face I could not even remember,

100
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,190
how could I just miss her?

101
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:19,640
Whether it's adoration,

102
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,740
revenge

103
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:21,839
or remorse,

104
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:25,490
I expected her to recognize me immediately.

105
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:30,900
But seeing that she had forgotten all about me,

106
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:35,500
only then did I understand the Creator's intention.

107
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:40,030
It turned out that during that long time,

108
00:04:40,030 --> 00:04:44,110
I have been shamefully struggling with the wretched self

109
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:52,970
in the mirror.

110
00:05:03,790 --> 00:05:06,230
Are you saying that Han Gye-jeol is the woman?

111
00:05:07,350 --> 00:05:09,880
So you've already kissed?

112
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:11,250
How did you do it?

113
00:05:11,250 --> 00:05:12,860
Can't you have any sense?

114
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,530
What do you mean by kissing at this time?

115
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:16,560
Don’t be stupid!

116
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,690
How can that woman remember things from a thousand years ago?

117
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,410
He must have seen her past life to be so sure.

118
00:05:22,410 --> 00:05:26,140
But to see a person's past life, they must kiss.

119
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,030
What does this mean?

120
00:05:27,030 --> 00:05:29,000
It means that they have already kissed.

121
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:30,810
That makes sense.

122
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:32,700
But I think they've only met a few days ago.

123
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:34,590
What a talent!

124
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:35,650
Well...

125
00:05:38,170 --> 00:05:40,920
We haven't gotten to the kissing stage yet.

126
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:42,460
What?

127
00:05:42,460 --> 00:05:45,870
Then how did you know that woman's name was Seol Hui?

128
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,640
The name is engraved on the ring.

129
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:52,320
That's what I said.

130
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:54,090
Can anyone succeed in kissing?

131
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:55,230
It's not that I didn't succeed in kissing.

132
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:56,490
I just didn't do it.

133
00:05:58,510 --> 00:06:03,300
Kissing is like a doorway to a past life.

134
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:08,580
It's already clear, so why go through the trouble of kissing her?

135
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:12,300
That's true. It’s better kiss her to make sure.

136
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:16,940
Don't be conceited and waste your time and do things in vain.

137
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,010
To be honest, it's not that you don't kiss, but that you can't kiss.

138
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:22,720
I have said that there is evidence that only I can recognize.

139
00:06:25,310 --> 00:06:28,940
There is no one in this world can treat immortals like their own servants.

140
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:35,040
As the Lord Deity said it.

141
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:38,900
Now it's all about getting out of the misery.

142
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,090
Getting out?

143
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:43,440
Until the woman says she loves you even being like this,

144
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:48,980
your cursed life will end and you will be at peace forever.

145
00:06:48,980 --> 00:06:50,450
Of course.

146
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:52,240
This time, we must try our best to seduce this girl,

147
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,800
letting her never forget Lord Deity.

148
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,340
Why?

149
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,550
Although I don't know what happened in the past life,

150
00:06:58,550 --> 00:07:01,520
Lord Deity, you suffer because you can't forget.

151
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,620
But that woman has forgotten everything and is living a good life.

152
00:07:03,620 --> 00:07:05,000
Don't you think it's wrong?

153
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,340
There must have been a time in her life when

154
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:08,220
she went crazy because she couldn't forget, right?

155
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,600
Although this is far less painful than Lord Deity.

156
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,520
So you let me take advantage of this opportunity of getting rid of my suffering to take revenge?

157
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:18,130
You're the one with the best ideas, Gak Shin.

158
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,800
Congratulations, Lord Deity.

159
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,840
Yes, it's been a long time coming.

160
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:22,600
Yes.

161
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,810
Aren't you going to congratulate him?

162
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:30,710
It's not time to celebrate with champagne.

163
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,140
You're just worried about money again, aren't you?

164
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,710
You're so rich and you're so stingy.

165
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:36,670
Hey, can any random people successfully seduce?

166
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,550
Let's pretend that his beauty is a powerful weapon.

167
00:07:40,550 --> 00:07:42,830
Who can withstand this bullshit personality?

168
00:07:42,830 --> 00:07:44,010
I'll bet my life that within 5 days of dating,

169
00:07:44,010 --> 00:07:48,040
Han Gye-jeol will be so angry that things will get messy.

170
00:07:51,590 --> 00:07:52,990
Oh, sir.

171
00:07:52,990 --> 00:07:56,780
You better wipe your neck.

172
00:07:56,780 --> 00:07:59,230
Of course, it could be that things don't get messy.

173
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:06,030
I'm warning you. Don't ever appear in front of me again.

174
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,800
It's already a mess.

175
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,930
Look, look, I knew this would happen.

176
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:12,390
One's true colors will always show through.

177
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:15,400
If it's leaking, fix it.

178
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:16,480
What do you want to do?

179
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:22,000
Ok Shin, how is your small store doing?

180
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:23,440
How can you say it's a small store?

181
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:26,100
We're one of the top 10 plutocrats in Korea.

182
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,410
Oh, really? That's great.

183
00:08:28,410 --> 00:08:31,710
I will use this money to seduce the woman who can fill the gap.

184
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,520
Why do you need my money to get out of your misery?

185
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:38,350
See, Lord Deity has a plan.

186
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,970
I've inadvertently forced Han Gye-jeol into a dead end.

187
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:43,409
Now she's in a trap.

188
00:08:43,409 --> 00:08:46,300
Giving her something sweet, she'll follow me.

189
00:08:50,020 --> 00:08:52,500
Yang Seon-ju.

190
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:56,610
Yang Seon-ju said her husband's business failed and he absconded overnight.

191
00:08:57,990 --> 00:08:59,770
Sa Guk-hwa.

192
00:09:01,490 --> 00:09:05,800
Although she may not want to talk with a public enemy like me either.

193
00:09:05,800 --> 00:09:06,920
Let’s do this.

194
00:09:10,450 --> 00:09:11,480
(Sa Guk-hwa)

195
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:19,200
Oh, Han Gye-jeol.

196
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:23,730
Yes, it’s me.

197
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:25,980
I heard you got fired for not playing your cards right.

198
00:09:25,980 --> 00:09:26,810
Awesome.

199
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:29,530
Yeah, that's right.

200
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:34,190
So do you have any recommendations for a hospital I can go to?

201
00:09:34,190 --> 00:09:36,490
A monthly-paid doctor at a sanatorium is fine.

202
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:40,770
Whether it's a convalescent hospital or what, who will use you? Are they crazy?

203
00:09:40,770 --> 00:09:45,460
Well, thanks for telling me this.

204
00:09:45,460 --> 00:09:51,200
By the way, I think Jeong I-deun said he needed a team doctor or something.

205
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,720
What? Who? Jeong I-deun?

206
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:57,930
Bye.

207
00:10:09,730 --> 00:10:11,230
Hey, Jeong I-deun.

208
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:17,760
Are you crazy? How dare you cheat on me, with my friend?

209
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:20,030
You know that Jung-eun and I are very close.

210
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:25,590
Of course I knew. That's why I hang out with you.

211
00:10:25,590 --> 00:10:27,100
What?

212
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:30,860
I used you because I wanted to get close to Jung-eun.

213
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:34,470
But after dating, I found that I was more comfortable with you.

214
00:10:34,470 --> 00:10:36,630
So I am dating both of you.

215
00:10:36,630 --> 00:10:37,910
Is that bad?

216
00:10:37,910 --> 00:10:40,610
Then you should have made it clear from the beginning.

217
00:10:40,610 --> 00:10:44,680
You cheated on me. Isn't that bad?

218
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:47,040
You didn't lose anything. How can this be cheating?

219
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:47,620
What?

220
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:50,990
I'm a golf star now.

221
00:10:50,990 --> 00:10:55,030
A person like me is dating a guy like you.
You're happy too, right?

222
00:10:55,030 --> 00:10:56,520
What? A guy like me?

223
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,650
Everyone envied you. You were happy too.

224
00:10:58,650 --> 00:11:01,810
You and I both have something to gain, so let's call it even.

225
00:11:01,810 --> 00:11:05,400
Were we in a business relationship?

226
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:08,570
What's the difference between love and business transactions?

227
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:10,610
It's the same when you look at what the other person has and weigh it against the other person's suitability.

228
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:15,780
What exactly do you expect in love?

229
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:41,920
I'm ashamed to say, but I was expecting a love like fate.

230
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:51,160
Maybe that's why I was attracted to Do Jin-woo.

231
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:56,870
The first time we met, I thought it was fate.

232
00:12:02,140 --> 00:12:05,100
How old are you?

233
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:07,430
It's time to wake up from the fantasy.

(Note: In Korean, "household" is the same as "duped person")

247
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,290
This household is not a duped person, right?

Otherwise, how can my nickname be Dog Nose.

253
00:13:15,830 --> 00:13:18,500
Is that why you followed me to Yeongpo? You've been idle lately?

You keep doing this and it will become a habit.

278

Why did you hit me?

287
00:16:43,030 --> 00:16:47,890
It's too beautiful. I'd rather believe it's a part-time job at a coffee shop.

288
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:54,330
Is it a pyramid scheme?
Like the kind that asks if you believe in religion first?

289

Interviewing a doctor.

297
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,880
Didn't I tell you that I don't want to get involved with you anymore?

298
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:58,980
But why do you keep wandering around in front of me?

299
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,060
Wandering around? Me?

300
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,560
I think you're the one who's wandering around now.

301
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:05,690
Didn't you say you were here for an interview?

302
00:18:05,690 --> 00:18:07,030
Just introduce yourself first.

303
00:18:07,030 --> 00:18:08,830
Deity, who are you?

304
00:18:08,830 --> 00:18:10,290
Why should I introduce myself?

305
00:18:10,290 --> 00:18:12,420
I am the owner of this hospital.

306
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,730
Owner?

307
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:16,390
You've lost your memory. When did you open a hospital?

308
00:18:16,390 --> 00:18:17,770
Of course it was opened with money.

309
00:18:17,770 --> 00:18:19,990
Although I have no memory, I have a lot of money.

310
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,810
How rich?

311
00:18:21,810 --> 00:18:23,720
Will the rent be waived?

312
00:18:23,720 --> 00:18:25,340
Like a kind-hearted landlord or something.

313
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:27,320
Rent? What's the point of collecting that kind of money?

314
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:29,900
How can you take that money and pretend to be kind?

315
00:18:30,780 --> 00:18:32,670
You don't charge rent?

316
00:18:32,670 --> 00:18:34,930
Yes, because it's a charity.

317
00:18:34,930 --> 00:18:37,840
Are you going to stand there like this?

318
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,770
Then let's read the contract before you leave.

319

00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,320
(Article 3: Distribution of benefits and operating costs)

322
00:18:56,600 --> 00:19:00,320
Not only is the free rent, but the hospital's profits are also mine?

323
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,740
My time in the world is short, Miss.

324
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,700
Hurry up and decide.

325
00:19:08,700 --> 00:19:10,870
How can I decide on something like this now?

326
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:12,370
If you can't decide now, you can't decide later.

327
00:19:12,370 --> 00:19:15,720
Whether it's time or fate, if you lose it, it's not yours anymore.

328
00:19:16,580 --> 00:19:19,030
It will become theirs.

329
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,690
Isn't it nice here?

330
00:19:29,690 --> 00:19:30,760
Let's live here.

331
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,240
I'll give you anything you want.

332
00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:36,770
So, is it free to live here too?

333
00:19:36,770 --> 00:19:39,520
The moment you sign the contract, it's yours.

334
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:40,470
Really?

335
00:19:40,470 --> 00:19:42,820
How can I let you work without even providing a place to live?

336
00:19:42,820 --> 00:19:46,080
I'm usually the one who teaches the evil boss a lesson.

337
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:52,970
Okay, I'll sign it.

338
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:53,750
Okay.

339
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:54,640
Here.

340
00:19:59,030 --> 00:20:01,150
(Business Cooperation Contract Han Gye-jeol)

341
00:20:01,150 --> 00:20:02,090
(Signature of Party B: Han Gye-jeol)

342
00:20:26,740 --> 00:20:29,710
So we're starting our first day today, right?

343
00:20:29,710 --> 00:20:32,450
Not so fast.

344
00:20:32,450 --> 00:20:35,020
We still have to register at the health center. There's a lot to do.

345
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:37,230
Do you have to apply to the state for a relationship between a man and a woman?

346
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:39,140
That's really tacky.

347
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:41,340
A relationship? Who?

348
00:20:43,700 --> 00:20:49,090
You can't pretend you don't know that you've finished stamping the red seal.

349
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:53,340
Party B, Han Gye-jeol have to date with Party A, Deity, for 90 days.

350
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,770
(Article 4 Special Matters
Party B, Han Gye-jeol, shall have a relationship with Party A, Deity, for 90 days.
Article 5 Penalty for breach of contract)
Party B, Han Gye-jeol have to date with Party A, Deity, for 90 days.

351
00:20:55,080 --> 00:21:01,160
If violate the contract, a one-time rent of 10 years has to be paid.

352
00:21:03,910 --> 00:21:05,230
There was no such thing.

353
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:06,260
How could it not be?

354
00:21:06,260 --> 00:21:08,620
You should read the contract carefully.

355
00:21:08,620 --> 00:21:11,110
This contract is not the same between the two sides is an unfair contract, it is against the law.

356
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:12,200
So sue me.

357
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,990
I think you can afford a lawyer, right?

358
00:21:14,790 --> 00:21:16,480
You were pushing me away earlier.

359
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Why do you do this to me?

360
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:19,330
Isn’t it written there? I want to date you.

361
00:21:19,330 --> 00:21:20,280
Is there anything else needed?

362
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,360
Yes!

363
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,500
What? Feelings?

364
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:23,570
Apology.

365
00:21:23,570 --> 00:21:24,820
You did that to me

366
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,440
with no apology.

367
00:21:26,440 --> 00:21:28,100
It drives me crazy just looking at you.

368
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:29,890
How can I date you?

369
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:34,800
Well,

370
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:37,820
how much is the rent for ten years?

371
00:21:37,820 --> 00:21:39,900
What?

372
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:45,180
Well, for ten years, about 100 million won.

373
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,750
100 million won?

374
00:21:47,750 --> 00:21:52,780
Damn it!

375
00:21:59,060 --> 00:22:00,120
So cold.

376
00:22:09,950 --> 00:22:11,740
Eat something cold to cool you down?

377
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:14,710
Something like that.

378
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:17,980
What's going on? Pyramid scheme?

379
00:22:17,980 --> 00:22:19,630
Have you been asked to buy jade flooring?

380
00:22:19,630 --> 00:22:20,960
Where? Show me the way!

381
00:22:23,830 --> 00:22:25,690
It’s a normal hospital.

382
00:22:25,690 --> 00:22:27,630
They were begging me to work there.

383
00:22:27,630 --> 00:22:30,610
But I’ve decided not to go.

384
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,230
Why?

385
00:22:32,230 --> 00:22:34,110
I was asked to pay 100 million won.

386
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:35,780
That’s too much!

387
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,510
Isn’t that fraud?

388
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:40,930
The rent in that village is 100 million won a year?

389
00:22:40,930 --> 00:22:42,120
Not a year.

390
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,150
Then how many years?

391
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,260
Ten years.

392
00:22:45,260 --> 00:22:46,820
For 10 years,

393
00:22:56,290 --> 00:22:57,970
it is 830,000 won a month.

394
00:22:57,970 --> 00:23:00,010
The rent and apartment only cost 830,000 won.

395
00:23:00,010 --> 00:23:02,220
In that case, sister, isn’t it to your advantage?

396
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,900
Really?

397
00:23:03,900 --> 00:23:08,060
Oh god! Why do you become so smart suddenly, Chul?

398
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:09,060
Is it because this is a good place?

399
00:23:09,060 --> 00:23:11,890
You’d pay a lot more to sell bungeoppang.

400
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:14,390
What use does God give you good food?

401
00:23:14,390 --> 00:23:16,730
You can’t eat them because you can’t count your bills.

402
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:19,920
So no one would look down on me,

403
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,230
and I don’t have to worry about getting kicked out.

404
00:23:21,230 --> 00:23:24,440
But only 830,000 won a month, right?

405
00:23:27,960 --> 00:23:30,740
Why not take this opportunity to become self-employed?

406
00:23:33,840 --> 00:23:36,620
It’s not difficult to borrow 100 million won, Miss.

407
00:23:36,620 --> 00:23:40,230
I saw TV shows where you get kicked out for not having a job.

408
00:23:40,230 --> 00:23:41,500
That’s on a TV show.

409
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,690
Everything will be okay as long as you’re a doctor.

410
00:23:43,690 --> 00:23:46,600
Well, alright.

411
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,270
Okay,

412
00:23:48,270 --> 00:23:51,300
you don’t have liability accounts or other loans, right?

413
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,630
Do you think someone in his 30s doesn’t have those?

414
00:23:54,970 --> 00:23:56,860
(MK Bank)

415
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:07,050
How can this be easy?

416
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:09,700
If I were the staff in the bank, I also wouldn’t do that.

417
00:24:11,250 --> 00:24:14,020
Why can’t I get any windfalls?

418
00:24:20,110 --> 00:24:22,050
The windfall really fell on me!

419
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:30,940
It would be nice if it was my money.

420
00:24:30,940 --> 00:24:32,250
It’s all yours.

421
00:24:39,550 --> 00:24:42,490
Did you make this happen, Deity?

422
00:24:44,070 --> 00:24:45,680
Is it an event made by a company?

423
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:48,340
Is anyone there?

424
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,930
What’s going on here?

425
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:55,560
Are you bragging about your money now?

426
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,080
I’m apologizing.

427
00:24:57,080 --> 00:24:57,750
What?

428
00:24:57,750 --> 00:24:59,420
I thought you said you wanted me to apologize.

429
00:25:01,300 --> 00:25:05,220
If you want to apologize, it’s not about money, it’s about words.

430
00:25:07,420 --> 00:25:08,130
I’m sorry.

431
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,090
Are you kidding me?

432
00:25:09,090 --> 00:25:12,360
See? You can’t feel my sincerity from my words. So you get angry.

433
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,550
But you can feel it from the money precisely.

434
00:25:14,550 --> 00:25:16,960
Do you want 10,000 won or a million won for my apology?

435
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:22,140
I’ll give you 100 million won, Han Gye-jeol.

436
00:25:23,290 --> 00:25:28,910
Take it. No, no. Take my apology and date me.

437
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:37,790
Well... Why do you suddenly want to date me? Let’s start with the reasons.

438
00:25:37,790 --> 00:25:39,330
Reasons?

439
00:25:39,330 --> 00:25:43,720
Well, just looking at you reminds me of my forgotten memories.

440
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,740
At all the time I was supposed to be with someone, I was alone.

441
00:25:46,740 --> 00:25:49,400
So I feel wronged and angry but what else can I do?

442
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:50,970
Maybe this will put an end to my pain.

443
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:55,170
Does it make sense for me to say that you have to date me to find your memories.

444
00:25:55,170 --> 00:25:58,840
Yes, I’ll find my memories and you’ll own the hospital.

445
00:25:58,840 --> 00:26:01,880
Isn’t it a win-win? As a businessman, I’m always fair.

446
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:07,380
We’ll get what we need, so it’s quite equal.

447
00:26:09,650 --> 00:26:12,800
Why do you always want to make deals with me?

448
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:14,970
I can’t understand.

449
00:26:14,970 --> 00:26:17,720
I can’t understand.

450
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:20,060
I’m handsome, smart and rich.

451
00:26:20,060 --> 00:26:22,660
A perfect person like me wants to date you.

452
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:24,520
Are you really that resistant?

453
00:26:25,990 --> 00:26:29,730
Aren’t you happy when such a man dates you, sister?

454
00:26:29,730 --> 00:26:32,030
Are they twins?

455
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:35,460
Why did they say the same words!

456
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:39,030
Yes, I’m worse than you. You don’t have to tell me this.

457
00:26:39,030 --> 00:26:41,620
I see, so get out of my face.

458
00:26:41,620 --> 00:26:43,460
I’m so angry now.

459
00:26:45,320 --> 00:26:46,200
Well, let’s try to date...

460
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,730
You are really annoying.

461
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,220
Break every bone in your body!

462
00:26:52,220 --> 00:26:54,760
Only then will you never appear in front of me, right?

463
00:26:54,760 --> 00:26:57,290
And I won’t get angry again.

464
00:26:59,110 --> 00:27:01,710
Han Gye-jeol.

465
00:27:27,020 --> 00:27:31,330
I thought we were talking about money and apology. Why did she get angry?

466
00:27:31,330 --> 00:27:34,760
I heard there are so many people suffering from dysthymia. She seems to be among them.

467
00:27:36,500 --> 00:27:40,260
The stone Buddha would also be angry after hearing your words.

468
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:44,890
Since you want to date her, you have to be well-prepared.

469
00:27:44,890 --> 00:27:48,640
I’m so handsome, smart and rich.

470
00:27:48,640 --> 00:27:51,190
What else do I need to prepare?

471
00:27:51,190 --> 00:27:53,670
At least you should know what that woman likes and dislikes.

472
00:27:53,670 --> 00:27:57,720
What kind of men will make her happy or sad?

473
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,970
Gak Shin, I don’t have time in the world.

474
00:27:59,970 --> 00:28:01,840
I don’t have time to learn that.

475
00:28:01,840 --> 00:28:03,620
Even if you don’t have time, you must do that.

476
00:28:03,620 --> 00:28:05,250
Even if I have time, I won’t do that.

477
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:11,300
Understanding, bonding, and remembering. These all belong to her in this life.

478
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,980
You’re really stubborn.

479
00:28:15,140 --> 00:28:16,500
You did this on purpose!

480
00:28:22,290 --> 00:28:26,480
What did Han Gye-jeol do to make Lord Deity be like this?

481
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,930
Is there really a way in the world to do this to Lord Deity?

482
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,030
Do you want to try it after you get to know it?

483
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:35,210
You...

484
00:28:36,970 --> 00:28:42,960
See? I told you not to move. You’re really disobedient.

485
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,120
You stinker!

486
00:28:51,340 --> 00:28:54,080
What? What’s wrong with my hand?

487
00:28:56,300 --> 00:29:01,250
Do you want to try it again? Okay, fine. It didn’t work.

488
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,020
Sorry, sorry.

489
00:29:10,080 --> 00:29:11,610
What’s wrong?

490
00:29:15,430 --> 00:29:18,770
That’s it? Do you regress?

491
00:29:18,770 --> 00:29:20,660
Really regress?

492
00:29:30,690 --> 00:29:35,050
Are you having trouble with your abilities because you’re uncomfortable?

493
00:29:35,050 --> 00:29:37,970
Die, die!

494
00:29:37,970 --> 00:29:41,950
Well, it starts again.

495
00:29:41,950 --> 00:29:44,900
Die. Die!

496
00:29:46,330 --> 00:29:46,990
Who is it this time?

497
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:51,030
Choe Gwang-mo. Who is Choe Gwang-mo?

498
00:29:51,030 --> 00:29:54,630
Choe Gwang-mo, Choe Gwang-mo, find Choe Gwang-mo and show him.

499
00:29:54,630 --> 00:29:56,080
Wait a moment.

500
00:29:57,880 --> 00:30:00,480
Lord Deity, this man.

501
00:30:01,450 --> 00:30:04,280
Ok Shin, let’s wait and see.

502
00:30:12,630 --> 00:30:14,320
Have you tried?

503
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:15,730
Ah?

504
00:30:15,730 --> 00:30:17,160
You can’t even teleport now.

505
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:17,900
Well,

506
00:30:17,900 --> 00:30:19,470
Lord Deity is now a joke.

507
00:30:19,470 --> 00:30:21,980
Bad people in South Korea will live a good life.

508
00:30:22,830 --> 00:30:26,460
I think it’s you, Ok Shin, who wants to live a good life.

509
00:30:27,620 --> 00:30:30,790
Lord Deity.

510
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:32,230
Damn it!

511
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:33,040
Well, well.

512
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,330
Lord Deity!

513
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:36,050
You can’t teleport now.

514
00:30:36,050 --> 00:30:38,540
It’s the first time I’ve seen you like this in hundreds of years.

515
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:40,190
So please don’t go there today.

516
00:30:40,190 --> 00:30:42,710
I don’t have a good feeling.

517
00:30:42,710 --> 00:30:43,390
Let’s go next time.

518
00:30:43,390 --> 00:30:43,970
What?

519
00:30:43,970 --> 00:30:45,140
Get out of my way.

520
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:46,550
Lord Deity.

521
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,250
Damn it!

522
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,750
He just refuses to listen.

534
00:31:12,930 --> 00:31:16,750
Sorry, I’m really sorry.

535
00:31:16,750 --> 00:31:18,880
I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you.

536
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,920
How many times do I have to say it?

537
00:31:20,920 --> 00:31:24,840
The bruises on her face were from the accident.

538
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,370
The bruises from a fall

539
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:28,900
are not the same as the bruises from being beaten for a long time.

540
00:31:28,900 --> 00:31:32,330
Yoona’s kindergarten and the emergency room called the police for several times.

541
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:35,420
Alright.

542
00:31:35,580 --> 00:31:36,990
She is so disobedient.

543
00:31:36,990 --> 00:31:38,400
So I beat her just to educate her.

544
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:41,090
Can’t I even educate my kid?

545
00:31:41,090 --> 00:31:42,930
No,

546
00:31:42,930 --> 00:31:44,530
That’s a crime.

547
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:49,020
Then arrest me!

548
00:31:55,030 --> 00:31:57,030
There seemed to be a fire in her house two days before Yoona’s accident.

549
00:31:57,030 --> 00:31:57,940
Why?

550
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,610
She left the gas on when she wanted to cook herself something.

551
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,830
There were signs of arson in the house.

552
00:32:02,830 --> 00:32:06,060
Yoona stated that she hadn’t touched the gas.

553
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,590
She always lies.

554
00:32:08,590 --> 00:32:10,480
I wonder if she learned it from the orphanage.

555
00:32:11,530 --> 00:32:15,150
So I shouldn’t have brought her into my house without knowing her deeply.

556
00:32:15,150 --> 00:32:16,050
Choe Gwang-mo!

557
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:17,540
Did you want to kill Yoona?

558
00:32:17,540 --> 00:32:20,300
You had your own kid after adopting her,

559
00:32:20,300 --> 00:32:21,990
so you wanted to kill her.

560
00:32:21,990 --> 00:32:24,060
Actually,

561
00:32:24,060 --> 00:32:25,750
I really wanted to do that.

562
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:28,310
What did you say?

563
00:32:29,570 --> 00:32:32,670
But she died in that traffic accident.

564
00:32:32,670 --> 00:32:35,440
I didn’t kill her whether I wanted to or not.

565
00:32:35,440 --> 00:32:37,590
Why do you get mad in front of me?

566
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:40,640
Show me the proof, if you’re mad at me.

567
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:47,760
Visiting hours are over.

568
00:32:50,130 --> 00:32:51,570
Damn it!

569
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,090
Hey, police.

570
00:33:05,740 --> 00:33:06,870
For your hard work.

571
00:33:06,870 --> 00:33:08,980
You have come so far from Seoul,

572
00:33:08,980 --> 00:33:10,890
so take this as your fare.

573
00:33:12,290 --> 00:33:15,910
Put it away before I arrest you for bribery.

574
00:33:17,430 --> 00:33:19,160
The kid died.

575
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:21,420
I’ve got quite some compensation.

576
00:33:22,630 --> 00:33:25,000
Now that I’m rich, I’m thinking about doing charity.

577
00:33:33,380 --> 00:33:35,810
Choe Gwang-mo, go the hell!

578
00:33:36,130 --> 00:33:38,160
Go to hell! Go to hell!

579
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:41,760
Choe Gwang-mo is a murderer. Arrest him immediately!

580
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:44,140
Arrest him immediately! Arrest him immediately!

581
00:33:44,140 --> 00:33:47,280
Choe Gwang-mo is a murderer.

582
00:33:47,730 --> 00:33:49,340
I don’t even know what the King of Hell is doing!

583
00:33:49,340 --> 00:33:50,210
Why not just take this guy away?

584
00:33:51,800 --> 00:33:55,660
Choe Gwang-mo is a murderer. Arrest him quickly!

585
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:58,030
Arrest him! Arrest him!

586
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:01,570
Choe Gwang-mo is a murderer. Punish him by the law!

587
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:05,610
Yummy!

588
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,909
Who are you?

589
00:34:31,909 --> 00:34:33,880
Why did you pop out of nowhere?

590
00:34:33,880 --> 00:34:36,040
I’m a ghost, come to catch you.

591
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,630
Are you a trash reporter?

592
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,460
Didn’t I say that?

593
00:34:52,460 --> 00:34:53,949
I didn’t kill her.

594
00:34:53,949 --> 00:34:56,659
People will never know

595
00:34:56,659 --> 00:35:00,200
it was you who pushed Yoona away.

596
00:35:12,990 --> 00:35:14,440
What?

597
00:35:33,570 --> 00:35:35,940
I’m fine, dad.

598
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:37,480
Don’t worry.

599
00:35:55,180 --> 00:35:58,930
How could you kill a kid for some compensation?

600
00:35:59,430 --> 00:36:02,960
How long should I look at a piece of shit like you?

601
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:05,280
My eyes would rot and I want to vomit just after looking at you.

602
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:06,510
How long?

603
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:19,190
What? You bastard!

604
00:36:20,490 --> 00:36:23,040
Don’t you dare threaten me!

641
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,260
-Lord Deity. -Although he eluded the police,

642
00:41:39,260 --> 00:41:40,440
This, this, this

643
00:41:40,440 --> 00:41:41,790
Lord Deity!

644
00:41:41,790 --> 00:41:43,880
Identification is under way.

645
00:41:43,880 --> 00:41:45,170
-Ah, Deity! -During the investigation,

646
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,290
no evidence was obtained,

647
00:41:47,290 --> 00:41:49,600
-so the investigation will be difficult. -Ah, Deity?

648
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,240
Have you lost your manners?

649
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,310
Do you want to die young?

650
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:54,160
Gyeongsangbuk-do, Yeongpo.

651
00:41:54,160 --> 00:41:57,750
My golden car! My old friend, golden car.

652
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:59,270
My car!

653
00:41:59,270 --> 00:42:00,920
Your car?

654
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,530
You don’t have anything in this house.

655
00:42:02,530 --> 00:42:03,220
They’re all mine.

656
00:42:03,220 --> 00:42:04,020
Really?

657
00:42:04,020 --> 00:42:06,670
You shouldn’t have gone out when you were not feeling well.

658
00:42:06,670 --> 00:42:10,400
You drove the golden car out and now become a criminal.

659
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,600
What should I do now?

660
00:42:11,600 --> 00:42:13,210
The police will soon find that the golden car belongs to me.

661
00:42:13,210 --> 00:42:15,080
What should I do then? What should I do?

662
00:42:15,080 --> 00:42:19,480
Just say it was stolen and ask them to catch the thief.

663
00:42:19,480 --> 00:42:20,680
Don’t you say you’re one of the top ten plutocrats?

664
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:23,970
You used to be so arrogant. Couldn’t you do that?

665
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:25,280
Get the hell out of here! Annoying!

666
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,560
My waist!

667
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:31,800
Why should I suffer such humiliation?

668
00:42:39,270 --> 00:42:42,370
You know the Yeongpo Honka, famous for their traditional hot sauce?

669
00:42:42,370 --> 00:42:46,210
The woman of that family manages the local social development fund.

670
00:42:46,210 --> 00:42:48,280
She does fund start-ups once in a while.

671
00:42:48,280 --> 00:42:49,690
You can have a try there.

672
00:42:49,690 --> 00:42:50,150
(Yeongpo Honka Master Mun Myeong-ja)
You can have a try there.

673
00:42:50,150 --> 00:42:51,490
(Yeongpo Honka Master Mun Myeong-ja)

674
00:42:56,750 --> 00:42:58,720
Hello, everyone.

675
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,680
-Hello. -Hello.

676
00:43:00,680 --> 00:43:03,140
Is master Mun Myeong-ja here?

677
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,920
You mean master Mun?

678
00:43:04,920 --> 00:43:07,200
Master.

679
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:08,330
What’s wrong?

680
00:43:08,330 --> 00:43:09,500
Who is it?

681
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:18,200
Nice to meet you, master Mun.

682
00:43:18,200 --> 00:43:20,550
I’m Han Gye-jeol. I’ve called you.

683
00:43:23,190 --> 00:43:26,830
Why did you two come together? Messy!

684
00:43:26,830 --> 00:43:28,110
Two?

685
00:43:30,450 --> 00:43:32,650
Are you here dating?

686
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,590
Don’t you want to work?

687
00:43:34,590 --> 00:43:35,500
Work?

688
00:43:35,500 --> 00:43:36,580
Let me see you at work.

689
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:39,560
Then I can know whether you can pay me back.

690
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:41,250
Forget it if you don’t want to.

691
00:43:43,070 --> 00:43:44,810
It’s good to work!

692
00:43:46,700 --> 00:43:48,710
I’m coming.

693
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:09,160
Have you seen it clearly?

694
00:44:11,020 --> 00:44:12,150
Yes!

695
00:44:13,160 --> 00:44:14,820
Give it a good stir!

696
00:44:14,820 --> 00:44:18,670
Make sure you don’t stick to the bottom of the pan.

697
00:44:18,670 --> 00:44:20,600
Or I have to throw it all away..

698
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:21,790
Okay.

699
00:44:32,020 --> 00:44:33,510
What are you doing here?

700
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,390
Borrow money. Your competitor.

701
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:39,910
Why do you want to borrow money since you’re quite rich?

702
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,590
Why compete with me?

703
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:43,900
Because you can’t get a loan if I get it.

704
00:44:43,900 --> 00:44:47,430
I heard it’s hard to lend money to two people at the same time here.

705
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:50,310
You can just take my money. Don’t bother so many people.

706
00:44:50,310 --> 00:44:52,620
You’re really annoying!

707
00:44:53,570 --> 00:44:57,370
If you want to date me, do something I like.

708
00:44:57,370 --> 00:45:00,830
No one is going to be fooled when you do such annoying things.

709
00:45:00,830 --> 00:45:02,530
You can do something I like.

710
00:45:02,530 --> 00:45:04,930
Because I have the right to let you please me.

711
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:06,480
What are you talking about?

712
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,460
Just give it up. See how tired you are.

713
00:45:08,460 --> 00:45:10,430
You can’t win me anyway.

714
00:45:10,430 --> 00:45:15,280
You should work hard if you want to compete with me.

715
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,470
Why am I the only one doing the work?

716
00:45:16,470 --> 00:45:20,100
Since ancient times, only the lower work hard.

717
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:24,390
But I’m not the kind.

718
00:45:24,390 --> 00:45:26,300
So I don’t need to work hard.

719
00:45:26,300 --> 00:45:27,760
Don’t just brag.

720
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:29,370
Come to stir.

721
00:45:29,370 --> 00:45:30,290
Work hard!

722
00:45:30,290 --> 00:45:33,100
I’ve told you it’s impossible.

723
00:45:39,610 --> 00:45:41,400
What’s wrong?

724
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,930
Are you turning to work hard suddenly?

725
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,170
You’re not an ordinary person.

726
00:45:45,170 --> 00:45:45,960
You just...

727
00:45:45,960 --> 00:45:48,630
Continue to stir. Go on!

728
00:45:48,630 --> 00:45:49,580
Don’t order me!

729
00:45:49,580 --> 00:45:51,130
Well, good job. Great!

730
00:45:51,130 --> 00:45:54,060
I’m not your slave.

731
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,770
Pray for my curse to be lifted.

732
00:45:56,770 --> 00:46:00,900
Or you’ll meet the most horrible god when your soul leaves the body.

733
00:46:00,900 --> 00:46:02,920
Because I’m gonna stare at you

734
00:46:02,920 --> 00:46:08,200
rubbing your hands and feet, kowtowing to me and becoming so humble.

735
00:46:08,200 --> 00:46:09,530
So spicy.

736
00:46:24,260 --> 00:46:26,460
Here you come.

737
00:46:26,460 --> 00:46:30,830
Well, you’ve done a good job.

738
00:46:30,830 --> 00:46:33,080
I can’t even do this well.

739
00:46:33,080 --> 00:46:34,620
Just seeing the way you work,

740
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:36,970
I know you can do everything well.

741
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,830
Why are you so weak as a man?

742
00:46:43,830 --> 00:46:45,460
So useless.

743
00:46:48,870 --> 00:46:50,890
Thank you.

744
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:55,290
Can’t that old woman see the sweat on my face?

745
00:46:56,510 --> 00:46:59,190
Why are you laughing? I’m asking you.

746
00:47:02,710 --> 00:47:04,010
(Asthma)

747
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:06,250
Do you have asthma?

748
00:47:06,250 --> 00:47:08,970
I’ve had asthma for years.

749
00:47:08,970 --> 00:47:11,210
I hope you can come and check on me often.

750
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:13,560
Of course, thank you.

751
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:15,360
I will do it seriously.

752
00:47:15,360 --> 00:47:17,210
It sounds like a boast.

753
00:47:17,210 --> 00:47:21,420
But if you offend me in Yeongpo, you’ll be very miserable..

754
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:25,470
So don’t even think about reneging on me.

755
00:47:25,470 --> 00:47:26,910
Do you understand?

756
00:47:26,910 --> 00:47:28,460
Yes.

757
00:47:28,460 --> 00:47:31,950
I’ll work hard and pay you back exactly.

758
00:47:39,110 --> 00:47:42,100
I’ll leave now.

759
00:47:42,100 --> 00:47:44,150
Okay, take care.

760
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:52,260
Why did you lend her so much money?

761
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:57,160
Are you talking to me?

762
00:47:57,160 --> 00:47:59,520
Is there anyone else?

763
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,900
I’d like to see

764
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:05,880
a doctor comes into your life,

765
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,520
and reveals your hidden secrets, and you’re not going to do anything about it.

766
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:20,270
Such a rude man.

767
00:48:37,040 --> 00:48:37,790
What are you doing?

768
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:40,010
Are you so happy to have borrowed money?

769
00:48:40,010 --> 00:48:42,010
I’ll have my own hospital soon.

770
00:48:42,010 --> 00:48:43,720
Although the owner is not good,

771
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:45,930
it’s still tolerable.

772
00:48:45,930 --> 00:48:49,030
There is no such thing as the best of both worlds.

773
00:48:49,030 --> 00:48:51,810
People can’t have the cake and eat it.

774
00:48:51,810 --> 00:48:53,060
Because you’ve only lived for 30 years,

775
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:54,810
you can be satisfied with just one good thing.

776
00:48:54,810 --> 00:48:58,340
If you live for 300 years, you will ignore the one good thing.

777
00:48:58,340 --> 00:48:59,870
There are no good things in this world,

778
00:48:59,870 --> 00:49:02,260
but only things that you can bear a little.

779
00:49:05,730 --> 00:49:09,490
I don’t know how you’re living that you’re so negative.

780
00:49:09,490 --> 00:49:14,430
I’m falling from a very high place now.

781
00:49:14,430 --> 00:49:16,270
The hope that one day I could fall to the bottom

782
00:49:16,270 --> 00:49:17,890
makes me fall deeper into the abyss.

783
00:49:17,890 --> 00:49:21,670
Isn’t it possible to learn to fly in the process of falling for a long time?

784
00:49:21,670 --> 00:49:24,510
Why don’t you teach me how to fly?

785
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:26,780
Reward after punishment is not bad.

786
00:49:26,780 --> 00:49:30,650
What are you talking about?

787
00:49:32,500 --> 00:49:34,390
Are you going to fall in love with me again?

788
00:49:35,530 --> 00:49:37,740
Tell me why you hate me.

789
00:49:37,740 --> 00:49:39,890
You were so attached to me. Why are you so fickle?

790
00:49:39,890 --> 00:49:43,000
No matter if it was in your past life or this life, is being fickle the best thing you can do?

791
00:49:43,000 --> 00:49:48,660
I don’t hate you, but I don’t like you enough to fall in love with you.

792
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:50,010
Then what can I do to make you like me?

793
00:49:50,010 --> 00:49:51,210
I want to find someone who I will like even if he doesn’t do anything for me,

794
00:49:51,210 --> 00:49:53,250
not someone who I will like only if he does something for me.

795
00:49:53,250 --> 00:49:55,280
There’s no such person.

796
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:58,360
There’s always someone like that, my true love.

797
00:49:58,360 --> 00:49:59,970
True love?

798
00:50:00,550 --> 00:50:03,670
I know, it’s childish and silly, right?

799
00:50:03,670 --> 00:50:05,030
Do you think life is just a joke?

800
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:06,060
Easy for you to say.

801
00:50:06,060 --> 00:50:08,460
What’s in your head? Everyone says so.

802
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,020
But it’s not a crime to believe in fate, right?

803
00:50:11,020 --> 00:50:13,140
It’s a crime.

804
00:50:13,140 --> 00:50:13,830
What?

805
00:50:13,830 --> 00:50:16,280
Do you feel good about standing on the Creator’s appointed path?

806
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:19,190
Is it so good to live as a puppet of the Creator?

807
00:50:19,190 --> 00:50:22,330
As a human being, if you don’t have the least self-esteem and will,

808
00:50:22,330 --> 00:50:23,960
that’s a crime.

809
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:28,430
Will the path God has appointed for me be bad for me?

810
00:50:28,430 --> 00:50:30,980
If he is for me,

811
00:50:30,980 --> 00:50:33,640
he will only look at me, right?

812
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,040
He won’t consider whether there is a better person,

813
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:44,120
or whether it will be poured out or overflowed.

814
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:46,200
Even if it’s a useless person like me,

815
00:50:47,070 --> 00:50:48,630
he will love me, right?

816
00:50:48,630 --> 00:50:50,920
Do you have so little confidence in yourself?

817
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:52,760
Do you feel so ordinary?

818
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:56,650
Do you like yourself?

819
00:50:59,610 --> 00:51:01,320
So...

820
00:51:02,330 --> 00:51:04,000
If you really want to be with me,

821
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:07,410
don’t show me the contract. Show me the evidence.

822
00:51:07,410 --> 00:51:08,950
What evidence?

823
00:51:08,950 --> 00:51:13,330
That you are my fate.

Here is fate and there is fate.

826

Mankind is obsessed with fate.

827
00:51:40,670 --> 00:51:42,280
The Creator will be happy that

828
00:51:42,280 --> 00:51:45,590
there are so many people loyal to him.

829
00:51:45,590 --> 00:51:47,540
What can they do?

830
00:51:47,540 --> 00:51:49,560
They feel uneasy like a boat floating in the vast sea.

831
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,000
At least they can use this as a beacon to hold on.

Just hypnotize Han Gye-jeol.

838
00:52:06,100 --> 00:52:07,210
Look her in the eye.

839
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:08,620
Han Gye-jeol, Han Gye-jeol, Han Gye-jeol.

What is the evidence of her so-called fate?

It’s so easy to ask her directly.

I don’t want to.

844
00:52:17,500 --> 00:52:20,890
This is not a power for the sake of an insignificant human.

845
00:52:23,580 --> 00:52:25,570
You’re not in a hurry.

846

Thank you.

but in fact, my muscles are quite strong.

This... is the bruise caused by falling down,

because I often see ghosts.

882
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:37,270
How often do you see ghosts?

883
00:54:37,270 --> 00:54:40,080
Is there a time period when you see them often?

884
00:54:40,080 --> 00:54:42,540
It seems not.

If it’s not suitable, it can cause side effects.

I’ve been taking angina medicine for a long time.

So far there is no problem.

Wife?

892
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:13,410
The doctor said the fainting was caused by staying up late playing Go.

893
00:55:13,410 --> 00:55:17,510
You’re so desperate to play Go.

894
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:20,830
You can’t play Go for hours on an empty stomach.

I see you have diabetes.

896
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:25,330
What? I have diabetes?

897
00:55:25,330 --> 00:55:26,810
Don’t you know it?

898
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:28,750
Your blood sugar level is very high.

899
00:55:28,750 --> 00:55:30,600
Do I see ghosts because of my diabetes?

900
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:32,470
No.

901
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:35,070
How about checking the diabetes first?

902
00:55:35,070 --> 00:55:38,260
I’ll take care of my family’s business.

903
00:55:38,260 --> 00:55:41,930
Well... since you’re here, just check it out...

904
00:55:41,930 --> 00:55:43,760
Dr. Han,

905
00:55:43,760 --> 00:55:46,100
you really like to meddle in other people’s business.

906
00:55:46,100 --> 00:55:50,640
If you want to live here, you’ll have to get rid of your nosiness.

907

If you’re always like this,

908
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:55,490
don’t try to borrow my money for your business.

909
00:56:09,840 --> 00:56:11,390
So tired.

910
00:56:12,930 --> 00:56:16,080
Don’t borrow money from the woman named Mun.

914
00:56:23,480 --> 00:56:25,490
Didn’t you see the bruises on his chest just now?

915
00:56:25,490 --> 00:56:27,630
Ah, that...

916
00:56:27,630 --> 00:56:32,130
That’s the bruise caused by falling down, because he often sees ghosts.

917
00:56:32,130 --> 00:56:36,010
If you get involved with a poisoner, you might go to jail too.

918
00:56:36,010 --> 00:56:37,650
Poisoner?

919
00:56:37,650 --> 00:56:38,690
That guy

920
00:56:38,690 --> 00:56:41,450
just fell down and got sick because of hallucination.

921
00:56:41,450 --> 00:56:43,830
This is how poison killing began in the past.

922
00:56:43,830 --> 00:56:47,060
There are many diseases with such symptoms.

923
00:56:47,060 --> 00:56:49,160
There’s no poisoning in this world nowadays.

924
00:56:56,610 --> 00:57:00,990
Well, she’s not as innocent as she looks.

925
00:57:00,990 --> 00:57:03,650
Could she remember her past life?

926
00:57:03,650 --> 00:57:05,960
Does she know something so she’s avoiding me?

927
00:57:06,870 --> 00:57:10,470
If not, there’s no reason to reject me.

928
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:13,910
I’m really curious.

929
00:57:14,890 --> 00:57:17,050
If I’m curious, I will lose.

930
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:29,950
I don’t mean to. I’ll leave now.

931
00:57:29,950 --> 00:57:31,010
Leave...

932
00:57:33,030 --> 00:57:34,150
Leave.

933
00:57:35,920 --> 00:57:37,030
Are you sleeping?

934
00:57:50,520 --> 00:57:52,590
What are you sleeping on?

935
00:57:52,590 --> 00:57:54,810
I can’t do this.

936
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,570
I can’t.

937
00:58:13,820 --> 00:58:15,480
Gye-jeol.

938
00:58:35,570 --> 00:58:37,500
Is she...

939
00:58:51,580 --> 00:58:52,180
What’s wrong? What’s wrong?

940
00:58:52,180 --> 00:58:53,370
What’s wrong? Is there a bug?

941
00:58:53,370 --> 00:58:54,660
There was someone over there.

942
00:58:54,660 --> 00:58:56,540
There was a man. I saw a man.

943
00:58:56,540 --> 00:58:58,570
There’s no one here.

944
00:59:04,290 --> 00:59:05,600
He was clearly there.

945
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,840
That’s because you’re too weak.

946
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:09,870
Get up and take your medicine.

947
00:59:42,430 --> 00:59:44,890
You’re not a child. How could you have nightmares?

948
00:59:44,890 --> 00:59:47,300
Maybe it’s because I have something on my mind.

949
00:59:47,300 --> 00:59:49,580
What’s on your mind?

950
00:59:49,580 --> 00:59:54,090
I’m sure it’s not about poisoning, but I don’t understand.

951
00:59:54,090 --> 00:59:57,320
Poisoning? Who? Did you call the police?

952
00:59:57,320 --> 00:59:58,730
What?

953
00:59:58,730 --> 00:59:59,460
No...

954
00:59:59,460 --> 01:00:00,210
No.

955
01:00:00,210 --> 01:00:01,480
Well...

956

957
01:00:02,980 --> 01:00:05,180
Ah, thesis.

958
01:00:07,150 --> 01:00:10,210
Sister, I think you are too tired.

959
01:00:11,390 --> 01:00:13,000
Give it to me.

960
01:00:13,000 --> 01:00:14,030
Eat and cheer up.

961
01:00:14,030 --> 01:00:16,430
The instant noodles you eat at night are tonic for you.

962
01:00:16,430 --> 01:00:17,720
For you, it is poison.

963
01:00:17,720 --> 01:00:20,280
You lost your hair because you ate too much instant noodles.

964
01:00:20,280 --> 01:00:23,690
It takes one lawsuit from an instant noodle company to sober you up,

965
01:00:23,690 --> 01:00:25,390
right?

966
01:00:30,970 --> 01:00:31,400

01:00:33,180 --> 01:00:35,120
I’ve had asthma for years.

969
01:00:35,120 --> 01:00:36,710
I hope you can come and check on me often.

970
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:39,640
I’ve been taking angina medicine for a long time.

971
01:00:39,640 --> 01:00:42,340
So far there is no problem.

972
01:00:42,340 --> 01:00:46,790
It’s not the poison but the medicine.

973
01:00:58,840 --> 01:00:59,360
Read the contract carefully.

974
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,680
(Money consumption loan contract) The contract of money consumption loan between Mun Myeong-ja (hereinafter referred to as "Party A") and Han Gye-jeol (hereinafter referred to as "Party B") is as follows.

Read the contract carefully.

975
01:01:00,680 --> 01:01:02,460
Read the contract carefully.

976
01:01:02,460 --> 01:01:04,540
That’s the basic condition for doing business.

977
01:01:04,540 --> 01:01:06,400
Okay.

978
01:01:09,670 --> 01:01:11,990
Let’s talk.

979
01:01:13,190 --> 01:01:14,890
Look... look.

980
01:01:14,890 --> 01:01:17,620
How dare you talk to your elders like that?

981
01:01:17,620 --> 01:01:21,080
I know a big company that wants to buy your chili sauce in bulk.

982
01:01:21,080 --> 01:01:22,650
Are you interested?

983
01:01:22,650 --> 01:01:25,760
Come back later. Can’t you see I have a customer here?

984
01:01:25,760 --> 01:01:30,340
Go ahead. I’ll look at the contract here.

985
01:01:30,340 --> 01:01:33,350
-Can... can I?
-Yes.

986
01:01:45,590 --> 01:01:47,290
What do you want to confirm?

987
01:01:47,290 --> 01:01:48,990
The pill bottle.

988
01:01:48,990 --> 01:01:52,650
So, please just call Ms. Mun away for five minutes.

989
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:56,700
You chose to break the game.

990
01:01:57,290 --> 01:01:58,230
(Angina, asthma)

991
01:01:58,680 --> 01:02:01,590
If these two bottles are the same medicine...

992
01:02:05,690 --> 01:02:07,680
Why can’t I open this?

993
01:02:09,910 --> 01:02:11,760
Oh no!

994
01:02:11,930 --> 01:02:13,980
What are you doing?

995
01:02:13,980 --> 01:02:15,570
What are you doing?

996
01:02:23,050 --> 01:02:24,320
Did you

997
01:02:24,320 --> 01:02:27,460
put the asthma medicine in the angina medicine bottle?

998
01:02:27,460 --> 01:02:30,160
Your meddling is really disgusting.

999
01:02:30,160 --> 01:02:31,710
I won’t lend you any money.

1000
01:02:31,710 --> 01:02:33,840
Get out!

1001
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:36,920
Taking asthma medicine can cause blood sugar levels to rise.

1002
01:02:36,920 --> 01:02:39,360
That’s why you didn’t let him have a blood sugar test, right?

1003
01:02:39,360 --> 01:02:41,200
Because you can’t let the doctor find it out.

1004
01:02:41,200 --> 01:02:43,940
No. Why did I give asthma medicine

1005
01:02:43,940 --> 01:02:46,090
to someone who doesn’t have asthma?

1006
01:02:46,090 --> 01:02:49,810
So that... he can hallucinate.

1007
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,690
Choe Che-seung

1008
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:57,250
has side effects on steroids in asthma medicine,

1009
01:02:57,250 --> 01:03:00,450
so he became delusional.

1010
01:03:01,240 --> 01:03:04,420
Let me check.

1011
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:12,750
It’s not asthma medicine.

1012
01:03:12,750 --> 01:03:13,850
What?

1013
01:03:13,850 --> 01:03:16,840
Yeongpo Police Station, right? I’m Mun Myeong-ja.

1014
01:03:16,840 --> 01:03:20,270
I’m calling the police for a break-in.

1015
01:03:25,210 --> 01:03:27,470
Mun Myeong-ja.

1016
01:03:27,470 --> 01:03:30,290
How dare you call me by my name?

1017
01:03:30,290 --> 01:03:32,740
Mun Myeong-ja.

1018
01:03:33,520 --> 01:03:38,680
Mun Myeong-ja.

1019
01:03:44,290 --> 01:03:46,640
Mom?

1020
01:03:52,430 --> 01:03:54,200
Do you hate your husband so much

1021
01:03:54,200 --> 01:03:56,460
that you want to beat him to death?

1022
01:03:56,460 --> 01:03:58,380
I didn’t beat him.

1023
01:03:58,380 --> 01:04:02,880
He just went crazy for no reason and fell over himself .

1024
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:06,370
I’m not such a cruel woman, anyway.

1025
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:07,580
How can you not be a cruel woman?

1026
01:04:07,580 --> 01:04:11,120
You even changed his medicine in the hope that he would go crazy.

1027
01:04:11,120 --> 01:04:13,900
Because he always went to the chess academy to play chess.

1028
01:04:13,900 --> 01:04:16,500
I only changed it a few times.

1029
01:04:16,500 --> 01:04:21,560
He said he saw ghosts and hadn’t been there for a while.

1030
01:04:21,560 --> 01:04:23,630
If you really hate him so much,

1031
01:04:23,630 --> 01:04:24,590
why don’t you just break up?

1032
01:04:24,590 --> 01:04:27,730
Why do you have to live together and make such a scene?

1033
01:04:27,730 --> 01:04:31,070
Because I feel sorry for him. I feel sorry for him.

1034
01:04:31,070 --> 01:04:35,320
If I’m gone, who will take care of his meals?

1035
01:04:35,320 --> 01:04:39,050
I’m afraid he’ll be cheated by someone once he’s out.

1036
01:04:39,050 --> 01:04:42,450
If I can't see him, I’ll always think of him.

1037
01:04:42,450 --> 01:04:44,870
And I can’t abandon him.

1038
01:04:44,870 --> 01:04:47,350
Ah, annoying!

1039
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:57,530
Ms. Mun.

1040
01:04:57,530 --> 01:05:00,000
It should not be like this. Damn it!

1041
01:05:02,650 --> 01:05:03,360
Wait.

1042
01:05:03,360 --> 01:05:05,900
Ms. Mun.

1043
01:05:05,900 --> 01:05:08,450
How could this happen?

1044
01:05:11,970 --> 01:05:13,840
Deity,

1045
01:05:13,840 --> 01:05:16,400
What’s wrong with Ms. Mun?

1046
01:05:16,400 --> 01:05:19,860
Why did she suddenly answer everything you ask her?

1047
01:05:19,860 --> 01:05:24,010
Actually, my power should not be used on a mortal like her.

1048
01:05:24,010 --> 01:05:27,010
Just think of it as God giving her face.

1049
01:05:27,010 --> 01:05:29,210
(Hypnosis (note: hypnosis is homophonic with face))

1050
01:05:30,300 --> 01:05:32,710
I also learned that in counseling class.

1051
01:05:32,710 --> 01:05:34,850
It’s not hypnosis, it’s face!

1052
01:05:34,850 --> 01:05:37,070
Who is responsible for the compulsory education in South Korea?

1053
01:05:37,070 --> 01:05:39,450
I have to see that person tonight.

1054
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:41,370
No matter it’s hypnosis or face.

1055
01:05:41,370 --> 01:05:44,260
thank you for helping me just now.

1056
01:05:44,260 --> 01:05:46,600
I saw that you were in a difficult situation, so I helped you out.

1057
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:48,760
In the long run, that’s not helping you.

1058
01:05:48,760 --> 01:05:49,590
Why?

1059
01:05:49,590 --> 01:05:53,400
Because Mun Myeong-ja would never help a person who knows her secrets.

1060
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:56,850
It is said that people who can share secrets with are either friends or enemies.

1061
01:05:56,850 --> 01:06:00,460
Friends who can share secrets with will become enemies after a long time.

1062
01:06:00,460 --> 01:06:02,820
Mun Myeong-ja is very shrewd.

1063
01:06:02,820 --> 01:06:06,490
She’s not the one to make enemies from the start.

1064
01:06:06,490 --> 01:06:08,750
I see.

1065
01:06:09,530 --> 01:06:11,900
Then there’s no way out.

1066
01:06:11,900 --> 01:06:15,900
Okay, so take my money now.

1067
01:06:15,900 --> 01:06:18,170
I want to leave Yeongpo now too.

1068
01:06:18,170 --> 01:06:19,260
What?

1069
01:06:19,260 --> 01:06:21,390
Whether it’s to the mountains or to the island,

1070
01:06:21,390 --> 01:06:24,840
I’ll start over as a monthly paid doctor at a sanatorium.

1071
01:06:24,840 --> 01:06:27,200
No, just stay in Yeongpo.

1072
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:30,300
You don’t have to pay me. I’ll give you that hospital.

1073
01:06:30,300 --> 01:06:33,340
No, I don’t think it’s a good idea.

1074
01:06:33,340 --> 01:06:35,670
The things that happened in Yeongpo,

1075
01:06:35,670 --> 01:06:38,040
honestly, are like a dream.

1076
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:40,640
If I pay 830,000 won a month, that hospital will be mine.

1077
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:43,930
I have a house where I can live with my brother.

1078
01:06:43,930 --> 01:06:47,570
And an unbelievable contractual relationship.

1079
01:06:47,570 --> 01:06:50,690
When I think about it now, it’s really romantic.

1080
01:06:50,690 --> 01:06:52,460
But,

1081
01:06:52,460 --> 01:06:55,960
It’s all a dream.

1082
01:06:55,960 --> 01:06:58,920
When I wake up, I will feel that the reality is more miserable.

1083
01:06:58,920 --> 01:07:02,740
It is better not to have the dream .

1084
01:07:02,740 --> 01:07:04,180
Although I

1085
01:07:04,180 --> 01:07:06,720
do not have much money,

1086
01:07:07,700 --> 01:07:11,220
I still want to face the reality and live a good life.

1087
01:07:11,220 --> 01:07:13,670
I’m always angry with you these days.

1088
01:07:13,670 --> 01:07:16,870
To be honest,

1089
01:07:16,870 --> 01:07:19,250
I’m actually quite happy.

1090
01:07:20,740 --> 01:07:22,630
Thank you.

1091
01:07:22,630 --> 01:07:24,440
Han Gye-jeol,

1092
01:07:24,440 --> 01:07:25,570
you can’t leave me.

1093
01:07:25,570 --> 01:07:28,970
The moment you turn around, you’ll definitely come back.

1094
01:07:28,970 --> 01:07:30,290
How could it be?

1095
01:07:30,290 --> 01:07:31,740
I’m stubborn.

1096
01:07:31,740 --> 01:07:35,000
I’m a person of my word.

Do I have to know her?

1108
01:09:12,710 --> 01:09:14,729
Do you...

1109
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:20,859
know my mother?

1110
01:09:54,460 --> 01:09:56,920
(Next episode preview)

1111
01:09:57,500 --> 01:09:58,340
Maybe we were meant to be.

1112
01:09:58,340 --> 01:10:00,370
(Thanks to special appearance of Yoo Jae-suk, Jung Jae-ha, Lee Mi-joo, U Hyun, Wang Kwang-na)
Maybe we were meant to be.

1113
01:10:00,370 --> 01:10:03,860
That... long time no see, sister.
(Thanks to special appearance of Yoo Jae-suk, Jung Jae-ha, Lee Mi-joo, U Hyun, Wang Kwang-na)

1114
01:10:03,860 --> 01:10:04,700
That... long time no see, sister.

1115
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:05,520
Who are you?

1116
01:10:05,520 --> 01:10:06,600
The guy she’s having an affair with.

1117
01:10:06,600 --> 01:10:08,650
Deity, are you jealous?

1118
01:10:08,650 --> 01:10:09,320
No.

1119
01:10:09,320 --> 01:10:10,630
Are you disappointed in me?

1120
01:10:10,630 --> 01:10:11,980
I’m disappointed in myself.

1121
01:10:11,980 --> 01:10:12,750
I’ve decided.

1122
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,690
I said no.

1123
01:10:13,690 --> 01:10:15,170
Let’s try to keep it ambiguous.

1124
01:10:15,170 --> 01:10:16,100
Deity.

What are you doing here?

1126
01:10:21,560 --> 01:10:22,730
Have you...

1127
01:10:22,730 --> 01:10:24,630
met me in your past life?

1128
01:10:24,630 --> 01:10:25,860
Thank you

1129
01:10:25,860 --> 01:10:28,210
for remembering me.
