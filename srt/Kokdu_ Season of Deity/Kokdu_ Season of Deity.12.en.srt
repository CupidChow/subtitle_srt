1
00:00:03,920 --> 00:00:04,780
You're here.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:05,540
Sign this for me.

3
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:07,150
(Episode 12)

4
00:00:07,540 --> 00:00:08,610
It's just to help take care of a patient once.

5
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:09,730
Why are there so many documents?

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,080
That’s how it is when it’s related with the state.

7
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:13,720
It's all paperwork.

8
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,810
Oh, well.

9
00:00:14,810 --> 00:00:16,860
The person I met in Yeongpo, I met him here too.

10
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:18,020
Who?

11
00:00:21,430 --> 00:00:23,420
Did you apply for the security device?

12
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:27,600
He got my security device installed in Yeongpo.

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:29,710
Maybe it seems that he has been transferred to Seoul.

14
00:00:30,620 --> 00:00:31,430
He is a doctor.

15
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:32,530
What?

16
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:33,990
He's wearing a white coat of the Department of Internal Medicine of this hospital.

17
00:00:34,580 --> 00:00:36,750
Is his name Choi Tae-hyung? I think that's his name.

18
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,600
Ah, Professor Choi Tae-hyung.

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:39,740
Who are you?

20
00:00:42,620 --> 00:00:43,440
Hello.
(Internal Medicine Choi Tae-hyung)

21
00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:45,270
Why? Do you know him?

22
00:00:46,210 --> 00:00:48,280
Yes, I met him once. He's a professor here.

23
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:49,420
Is that so?

24
00:00:51,400 --> 00:00:52,880
Why do they look so much alike?

25
00:00:52,880 --> 00:00:54,690
Maybe they are brothers or they just look alike.

26
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:04,290
What? Did I say something wrong again?

27
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:06,570
Did I say the wrong word?

28
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:11,150
Just buy and drink it yourself.

29
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,510
How can you drink only half of it?

30
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:19,550
You're so good at making money...

31
00:01:19,550 --> 00:01:20,810
Ah!

32
00:01:35,650 --> 00:01:39,259
Ah, I Sang-jae asked me to ask him for the certificate.

33
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:45,009
Where is Professor I Sang-jae's office?

34
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,479
No. 704.

35
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:49,009
Thank you.

36
00:01:55,910 --> 00:01:57,600
Where is Professor Choi Tae-hyung's office?

37
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,050
Who?

38
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:01,180
Professor Choi Tae-hyung.

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,440
Prof. Choi Tae-hyung.

40
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:06,530
There is no such person in our department.

41
00:02:07,370 --> 00:02:07,980
What?

42
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:12,180
Oh, well.

43
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:14,180
The person I met in Yeongpo, I met him here too.

44
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:21,480
(Sister)

45
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,470
The number you have dialed cannot be reached at this time.

46
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:05,960
Sister? Sister?

47
00:03:17,620 --> 00:03:20,120
You and your brother are so alike even in tardiness.

48
00:03:20,610 --> 00:03:21,290
That’s...

49
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:30,570
Hello?

50
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:31,880
Something's happened to my sister.

51
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:34,130
What?

52
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,829
I think she's been kidnapped.

53
00:03:36,350 --> 00:03:37,000
Kidnapped?

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,620
I'm catching up. Don't worry.

55
00:03:42,250 --> 00:03:43,040
Where are you now?

56
00:04:36,270 --> 00:04:36,820
Han Gye-jeol.

57
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:40,100
Come out with your hands up!

58
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,610
Come out!

59
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,900
Wake up, Han Gye-jeol!

60
00:04:54,210 --> 00:04:55,580
(Emergency Center, Entrance)

61
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,110
Doctor, come out!

62
00:04:58,450 --> 00:04:59,950
What are you staring at?

63
00:05:05,410 --> 00:05:06,260
Hands up!

64
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,480
Throw the knife away, asshole!

65
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:16,990
Throw the knife away before I kill you.

66
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,440
Turn around.

67
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:29,890
Speaker.

68
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,870
I failed.

69
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:33,140
You...

70
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:39,480
Just erase the traces of the crime and hide.

71
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:41,610
Before I contact you, hide like you're dead.

72
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,540
Damn it.

73
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,030
Please help me persuade him. Don't let him come near.

74
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:09,810
Yes, Deity.

75
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,720
Don't meet with the chairman these days.

76
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:32,560
Tax evasion, bribery, sexual bribery...

77
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:33,990
You’ve got a lot of tricks up your sleeve.

78
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:36,010
Even if you had ten lives, it wouldn't be enough.

79
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:36,870
What are you talking about?

80
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,650
Even if you've been hiding all this,

81
00:07:43,650 --> 00:07:44,440
(Item Supply Contract)

82
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:45,900
this cramped room smells like decay.
(Item Supply Contract)

83
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,150
this cramped room smells like decay.

84
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,840
How long can you hide it?

85
00:07:51,430 --> 00:07:53,580
Turn around! Turn around! Turn around!

86
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:56,940
I don't want to kill you with one stroke.

87
00:07:58,010 --> 00:07:59,360
Because that would be too magnanimous.

88
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,860
I'll take everything you have from you.

89
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,980
Let you feel the powerlessness of not being able to move a single finger

90
00:08:08,980 --> 00:08:11,100
and leave you breathless and desperate.

91
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,400
Try the pain of having your heart broken.

92
00:08:31,260 --> 00:08:33,220
Do Jin-woo!

93
00:08:36,770 --> 00:08:37,510
(Seoul Myeongin University Hospital)

94
00:08:37,510 --> 00:08:38,820
Han Chul, open your eyes.
(Seoul Myeongin University Hospital)

95
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:40,720
I'm asking you to open your eyes.

96
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,360
Stop it!

97
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,260
How can I see your sister if you're like this?

98
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:47,290
I told you to stop.

99
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,170
Isn’t he sleeping?

100
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,540
Did he sleep too long? He's not a bear in hibernation.

101
00:08:59,170 --> 00:09:00,790
He drank a lot of drugged coffee.

102
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:02,680
Drinking that much, even a bear will collapse.

103
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:05,870
You're okay after your brother's faint?

104
00:09:05,870 --> 00:09:06,890
Why are you so heartless?

105
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:11,680
The monk who passed by said that this child has a long life.

106
00:09:12,220 --> 00:09:15,220
I don't even believe in the list of fate, but I believe in those words.

107
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:18,830
Brother-in-law.

108
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,060
I'll go get some water.

109
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:32,240
Wake up.

110
00:09:37,850 --> 00:09:39,280
Let me sleep for a while.

111
00:09:39,590 --> 00:09:40,690
Brother-in-law, are you okay?

112
00:09:42,500 --> 00:09:45,150
I really thought you were going to die. And you are yawning now.

113
00:09:45,150 --> 00:09:46,140
I won't die.

114
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,770
If I die,

115
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:52,700
my sister won't be able to live.

116
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:57,610
How lucky.

117
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,010
I'll call your sister.

118
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:04,920
Doctor.

119
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,910
He hasn't woken up for so long.

120
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,630
Should we have another check?

121
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:12,120
He'll be fine.

122
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,570
How can you guarantee that?

123
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,520
I'm a doctor too,

124
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,260
but I can't tell what kind of medicine he was given.

125
00:10:19,650 --> 00:10:22,410
You drank the same medicine and woke up just now, didn't you?

126
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,620
Maybe his physique is different from mine.

127
00:10:27,270 --> 00:10:29,560
You know that drugs have many side effects, right?

128
00:10:30,080 --> 00:10:32,610
It could be a medicine with strong side effects only for Chul.

129
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:35,100
I don't think so.

130
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:37,890
Please do a new toxin test.

131
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:40,890
We'll see how it goes. We'll talk about it then.

132
00:10:50,440 --> 00:10:51,110
Mom...

133
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,090
If you're afraid, tell me.

134
00:11:18,630 --> 00:11:20,340
That's why I didn't say anything because I was afraid.

135
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:26,360
I was afraid that if I said something bad,

136
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:32,390
then something bad will happen.

137
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:36,680
Don't worry.

138
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:39,630
Your brother is awake.

139
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:42,650
Really?

140
00:11:49,030 --> 00:11:50,690
Thank God, I was really worried....

141
00:11:55,780 --> 00:11:58,530
It really scared me to death.

142
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,170
(Myongin University Hospital)

143

(Myongin University Hospital)

145
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,390
everything collapsed and disappeared just like me.

146
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,540
The hidden breath,

147
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:20,220
the love that disappeared,

148
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:23,810
the ever-increasing misfortune,

149
00:12:26,020 --> 00:12:27,830
this is the death I know.

150
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:41,460
But I still can't understand tears.

151
00:13:04,610 --> 00:13:07,100
Although Lord Deity will be relieved forever by death,

152
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:07,800
but Han Gye-jeol…

153
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,570
Han Gye-jeol, who is left with only herself,

154
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,630
will be in terrible pain.

155
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,660
Are you sure you can bear her tears?

156
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:17,140
Han Gye-jeol's tears belong to herself, not to me.

157
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:34,190
I was...

158
00:13:36,420 --> 00:13:37,490
How arrogant I was.

159
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:52,290
A death without tears?

160
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,880
There is no such thing in this world.

161
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:58,260
I heard that this rabbit

162
00:13:58,720 --> 00:13:59,980
doesn't shed tears so easily.

163
00:14:04,940 --> 00:14:05,840
But even so,

164
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,400
how can it not even feel sadness?

165
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:09,760
You idiot!

166
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,180
That's why I asked you to think about it.

167
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:14,160
How do I disappear to make her feel less sad?

168
00:14:16,430 --> 00:14:17,210
Eyes...

169
00:14:17,630 --> 00:14:19,630
How about a sudden car accident?

00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,630
Do you need to get scolded to wake up?

171
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,590
At the same time as the accident happens,

172
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,300
Han Gye-jeol will get an inheritance.

173
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:29,820
A 5-storey building in the prime location in Jongno, which is mine.

174
00:14:30,230 --> 00:14:31,690
Then she’ll have no time to be sad.

175
00:14:32,010 --> 00:14:34,790
Because buildings can overcome tears.

176
00:14:36,330 --> 00:14:37,410
Not in an accident.

177
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,850
She has a shadow from her mother's accident.

178
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:44,520
Then tell her you're going to study abroad and cut off contact.

179
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,880
Don't you know what kind of person she is?

180
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,430
She even used SNS to successfully find Do Jin-woo.

181
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,430
How could she not find me?

182
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,440
St. Kitts and Nevis…

183
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:52,180
What the hell?

184
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:53,390
Sao Tome and Principe…

185
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,940
Antigua and Barbuda…

186
00:14:55,940 --> 00:14:58,650
Wow, that's like a forgotten spell.

187
00:14:58,650 --> 00:14:59,860
Just tell her you want to go to one of these countries.

188
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:01,530
She'll never find it with such a difficult name.

189
00:15:02,150 --> 00:15:02,810
Where are they?

190
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:03,760
Africa.

191
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:07,270
So you want me to tell her...

192
00:15:07,270 --> 00:15:09,090
-I'm going to study in Africa? -Yes.

193
00:15:09,860 --> 00:15:11,030
Yes. And what should I tell her to do there?

194
00:15:11,030 --> 00:15:13,170
Will it be running with cheetahs or drinking with hippos?

195
00:15:13,590 --> 00:15:14,620
Would you believe that if you were she?

196
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:17,420
Gak Shin, you've been so disappointing lately.

197
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:21,430
Let's say you have an incurable disease and a limited life.

198
00:15:21,430 --> 00:15:21,880
What?

199
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:24,410
I mean, you have to tell her when you're leaving.

200
00:15:24,940 --> 00:15:25,530
Only then...

201
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:26,470
Han Gye-jeol can spend the rest of the time

202
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:29,020
with no regrets.

203
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,590
My time in the world is very short, Gak Shin.

204
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,970
It's hard enough to live.

205
00:15:32,970 --> 00:15:34,210
Why do I have to arrange a death?

206
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:36,440
I don't want to shed tears when we meet for the rest of our time.

207
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:39,390
Whether you’re spending the rest of your days with tears or with smiles together,

208
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,190
you should choose together with Han Gye-jeol.

209
00:15:42,530 --> 00:15:43,390
It's obvious that dating is the affair of two persons.

210
00:15:43,390 --> 00:15:45,160
But why do you make the decision to break up alone?

211
00:15:55,550 --> 00:15:56,190
Try it.

212
00:15:56,870 --> 00:15:57,690
It's said that in ancient Maya

213
00:15:58,190 --> 00:15:59,280
it's a body booster.

214
00:16:02,050 --> 00:16:03,260
It's a love potion.

215
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:10,020
In chocolate, there is something called phenylamine.

216
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,550
It's the same ingredient as the hormone secreted when you fall in love.

217
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:18,530
You're really getting cheeky.

218
00:16:20,990 --> 00:16:23,890
A cramped room, late at night, a man and a woman,

219
00:16:25,400 --> 00:16:26,640
anyone else would be cheeky, right?

220
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,570
I'm not cheeky enough to

221
00:16:28,570 --> 00:16:31,710
get horny in front of a sick woman.

222
00:16:32,140 --> 00:16:33,280
I said it's okay.

223
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:35,840
I told you to stay in the hospital.

224
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:41,680
It's more comfortable here and more secure.

225
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:45,850
Did you get shocked?

226
00:16:50,610 --> 00:16:55,470
I think you're the target of Kim Pil-soo.

227
00:16:57,520 --> 00:17:00,490
He’s really annoying. I wish he was dead.

228
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:04,099
Just give me the order, and I'll kill him right away.

229
00:17:09,910 --> 00:17:11,560
When I see your eyes,

230
00:17:12,480 --> 00:17:13,589
I feel like you're really going to kill him.

231
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,470
That's why I can't do this.

232
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,599
I don't want to go to prison to see you for the rest of my life.

233
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:20,099
For the rest of your life?

234
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:23,020
What, you think I don't have the decency to do that?

235
00:17:32,220 --> 00:17:33,440
Is something bothering you?

236
00:17:36,710 --> 00:17:37,340
Well...

237
00:17:41,110 --> 00:17:43,070
It's about a friend of mine.

238
00:17:43,950 --> 00:17:45,870
Why do you all have the same lines?

239
00:17:46,930 --> 00:17:48,510
Is it because of the early education you received when you were an embryo?

240
00:17:49,590 --> 00:17:53,110
That friend of mine seems to have something to say to his girlfriend.

241
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,590
But it's not so easy to say.

242
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:58,940
If it were you, how can he say it

243
00:17:58,940 --> 00:17:59,740
without letting her be so surprised?

244
00:18:00,490 --> 00:18:01,550
Is it a marriage proposal?

245
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:09,670
Something normal.

246
00:18:11,830 --> 00:18:12,600
Normal?

247
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:16,400
On a morning when it is late autumn,

248
00:18:17,620 --> 00:18:20,730
when I was tossing and turning under the covers because the weather is getting cold,

249
00:18:21,310 --> 00:18:22,490
someone keeps on calling me out.

250
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:26,700
I follow and see it's just a very ordinary alley.

251
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,880
There is a small gold store.

252
00:18:30,970 --> 00:18:34,280
The gold store was full of wall clocks that I didn't know where they were going to be used.

253
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:36,250
I want to wear ordinary thread rings,

254
00:18:43,550 --> 00:18:47,280
with no brand, no decoration,

255
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:52,320
for each other.

256
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:57,670
And get a common confession.

257
00:19:34,750 --> 00:19:35,490
How should I say that?

258
00:19:35,490 --> 00:19:38,280
How can I say goodbye to you?

259
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:42,940
You are imagining that you will be with me in the future.

260
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,710
Abalone, oyster…

261
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:49,650
The aphrodisiacs of the East and the West have all come together.

262
00:20:49,650 --> 00:20:50,930
For the sake of your sincerity,

263
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:52,370
tonight, I'll be cheeky too.

264
00:20:52,370 --> 00:20:54,040
It's goddamn hot.

265
00:20:55,060 --> 00:20:56,530
It's hopeless.

266
00:20:56,530 --> 00:20:59,220
It's for the kid. Don't touch it.

267
00:20:59,220 --> 00:21:00,260
The kid.

268
00:21:00,260 --> 00:21:03,410
Do we already have a child? I prefer to have a daughter.

269
00:21:03,410 --> 00:21:07,540
You're a shameless pervert with your eyes blind.

270
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,230
I don't even need to see. I'm sure you’re not good enough.

271
00:21:10,230 --> 00:21:13,630
Why don't you date with me and see if you can say something like that?

272
00:21:13,630 --> 00:21:15,710
Can't you see I'm busy because of that child?

273
00:21:15,710 --> 00:21:17,570
I don't have time to go out with a pervert.

274
00:21:17,570 --> 00:21:21,040
Who's the kid? Your little brother?

275
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,500
My mouth is not a mouth anymore?

276
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:26,450
I've prepared yours separately.

277
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,030
It's good, right?

278
00:21:29,990 --> 00:21:31,030
Yes.

279
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,640
It's too ordinary.

280
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:53,650
The day is so lovely that I can’t bear myself.

281
00:21:59,540 --> 00:22:01,660
I'd rather not have

282
00:22:09,480 --> 00:22:11,120
that kind of dream.

283
00:22:23,940 --> 00:22:26,430
It's very similar, isn't it?

284
00:22:28,800 --> 00:22:30,000
Are you blind?

285
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,060
He's not that handsome.

286
00:22:32,060 --> 00:22:34,180
You'd have to be this good to find him.

287
00:22:35,960 --> 00:22:37,380
Are you blind too?

288
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,580
You both saw the same person.

289
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:40,700
But how can you draw him so differently?

290
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:43,890
I'm going to get the mockup tomorrow anyway.

291
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,360
With your eyesight,

292
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:47,690
even if the elderly of the mockup comes, he won't be able to find anyone.

293
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,170
Detective Kim is forcing the Chief of the Department of Internal Medicine to confess.

294
00:22:50,170 --> 00:22:51,460
Even if there's no such thing,

295
00:22:51,460 --> 00:22:53,200
I'll find out who the bastard is.

296
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,460
We can't find out.

297
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,020
Why?

298
00:22:56,020 --> 00:22:58,340
Kim Pil-soo should have prepared for this.

299
00:22:59,330 --> 00:23:01,460
Are you talking about Speaker Kim Pil-soo of Pilseong Bio?

300
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,590
Why are you talking about this?

301
00:23:04,500 --> 00:23:06,220
Know your enemy so you can protect yourself.

302
00:23:07,170 --> 00:23:09,230
Even if I have a falling out with you, brother-in-law.

303
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:12,090
How can the plutocrat kidnap people? Why in the end?

304
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,520
We'll find out why.

305
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:18,440
I'm warning you, don't investigate Kim Pil-soo alone.

306
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,900
Because he's not the guy you can deal with.

307
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,300
Got it?

308
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:26,110
Got it?

309
00:23:26,110 --> 00:23:27,330
Got it.

310
00:23:27,330 --> 00:23:27,370
(Search warrant for seizure)
Got it.

311
00:23:27,370 --> 00:23:29,270
(Search warrant for seizure)

312
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:30,750
Let's get started.

313
00:23:32,680 --> 00:23:36,910
Today, the prosecution is conducting
a full-scale seizure and search of Pilseong Bio.

314
00:23:37,990 --> 00:23:41,330
According to the prosecutor, an insider reported

315
00:23:41,330 --> 00:23:44,130
the instances of accounting fraud and
illegal lobbying of Pilseong Bio.

316
00:23:44,130 --> 00:23:45,570
Excuse me, please.

317
00:23:46,810 --> 00:23:47,720
Over there.

318
00:23:47,720 --> 00:23:50,420
Not even a few hours after
the prosecution's seizure and search,

319
00:23:50,420 --> 00:23:53,210
the chairman of Pilseong Bio Kim Pil-soo
came forward to the prosecution for investigation.

320
00:23:53,210 --> 00:23:55,230
Is it true that there is fraudulent accounting at Pilseong Bio?

321
00:23:55,230 --> 00:23:57,230
Do you admit to illegal lobbying on all fronts?

322
00:23:57,230 --> 00:23:58,970
Say something.

323
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:01,930
All the truth will be found out
through the prosecution's investigation.

324
00:24:01,930 --> 00:24:05,640
I'm sure that Pilseong Bio and I didn't
do anything improper.

325
00:24:06,760 --> 00:24:10,020
Such a rumor is due to my immorality.

326
00:24:10,020 --> 00:24:12,020
In order to be responsible for this,

327
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,450
I am also considering withdrawing

328
00:24:14,450 --> 00:24:17,340
the marketing application for AXIS,
a new cartilage regeneration drug

329
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:20,180
that I intend to launch within the year.

330
00:24:20,180 --> 00:24:21,760
Do you admit to the fact that
the accounting is fraudulent?

331
00:24:21,760 --> 00:24:24,420
Do you admit to all suspicions?

332
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,410
Please take a look here.

333
00:24:29,130 --> 00:24:32,970
Taxes, sexual favors,

334
00:24:34,970 --> 00:24:35,970
bribes,

335
00:24:37,150 --> 00:24:38,460
even violence was used.

336
00:24:40,330 --> 00:24:42,200
That's a bit much.

337
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:44,510
Yes, it's a bit too much.

338
00:24:45,530 --> 00:24:46,680
It’s not like me at all.

339
00:24:47,640 --> 00:24:52,400
I've always done difficult things
by other people's hands.

340
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:56,300
How can you be so relaxed?

341
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,870
We'll see.

342
00:24:57,870 --> 00:25:00,350
Someone else will handle it this time too.

343
00:25:08,280 --> 00:25:10,520
Hello, this is Sin Sang-won, the chief prosecutor.

344
00:25:11,460 --> 00:25:12,520
Yes.

345
00:25:22,340 --> 00:25:23,620
He’s here.

346
00:25:26,510 --> 00:25:27,670
Who is this?

347
00:25:27,670 --> 00:25:29,790

-Bulhwa Company, quit!
-Quit!

352
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:35,760
What's going on here?

353
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:37,460
Bulhwa Company, quit!

354
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:39,950
Quit!

355
00:25:41,130 --> 00:25:42,560
Quit!

356
00:25:50,990 --> 00:25:54,120
What? Is there a rumor going around?

357
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:57,480
Bulhwa Company intends to acquire Pilseong Bio.

358
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:59,020
In order to lower the acquisition price,

359
00:25:59,020 --> 00:26:01,430
we even prevent the normal launch of the new drug.

360
00:26:01,430 --> 00:26:03,460
This rumor has suddenly spread.

361
00:26:03,460 --> 00:26:06,020
Then you should have told me earlier.

362
00:26:06,020 --> 00:26:08,110
No, you shouldn't have known that.

363
00:26:08,110 --> 00:26:09,620
That's how we should be bullied.

364
00:26:09,620 --> 00:26:11,500
Why should I be bullied?

365
00:26:11,500 --> 00:26:15,800
They'll think we have no countermeasures
and let down their guard.

366
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:18,500
Then I'll have time to think.

367
00:26:18,500 --> 00:26:20,020
What are you thinking about?

368
00:26:20,020 --> 00:26:21,750
We've already played such a big game.

369
00:26:21,750 --> 00:26:23,770
Can we over it with a few scratches of hair?

370
00:26:23,770 --> 00:26:28,150
This level will not cause public outrage.
Public outrage, idiot!

371
00:26:33,850 --> 00:26:38,850
There must be a climax, but I just don't know
what it is.

372

A sports star who is frustrated while secretly waiting for a new drug.

00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,820
There's no better climax than this.

377
00:27:10,210 --> 00:27:11,780
I told you, my knees hurt and I'm not in good condition.

378
00:27:11,780 --> 00:27:13,140
So I don't want to swim.

379
00:27:13,140 --> 00:27:16,570
There's no better way to train with bad knees than to swim.

380
00:27:20,150 --> 00:27:23,040
All right, let's train.

Player.

382
00:28:11,650 --> 00:28:14,600
I can't go on.

383
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:16,240
My condition is really...

384
00:28:17,300 --> 00:28:18,790
One more time.

385
00:28:18,790 --> 00:28:21,480
One more swim and we're done.

I can't sleep on my pillow.

396
00:30:25,790 --> 00:30:29,640
Open the curtain and look west at the peach blossoms.

397
00:30:30,590 --> 00:30:34,750
Peach blossoms still smile at the spring breeze.

398
00:30:36,020 --> 00:30:37,610
Smile at the spring breeze.

399
00:30:38,520 --> 00:30:42,040

the lingering thoughts.

400

Who is it?

Who is it?

402
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,280
So it's a love poem.

403
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:57,220

405

You're really...

406
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,710
What kind of woman do you love

407
00:31:06,710 --> 00:31:08,820
that makes you write sad poems every time?

408
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:12,170
Tell me, maybe I can help you.

409
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,260
Brother?

410
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,950
Don't laugh. Listen to me carefully.

411
00:31:17,650 --> 00:31:18,980
I didn't realize it before.

412
00:31:18,980 --> 00:31:21,280
I seem to know the heart of a woman very well.

413
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,600
Very talented.

414
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,310
A man with such talent can't even choose a ring.

415
00:31:27,310 --> 00:31:29,050
So you asked me to come here?

416
00:31:29,050 --> 00:31:31,050
Mother asked me to go grocery shopping
with her just now.

417
00:31:31,050 --> 00:31:32,440
I'll leave now.

418
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,710
Mother has already left.

419
00:31:35,700 --> 00:31:39,230
Yeong, I know women's hearts,

420
00:31:40,280 --> 00:31:42,060
but I don't know rings.

421
00:31:42,060 --> 00:31:44,420
All the round things look the same.

422
00:31:45,490 --> 00:31:48,000
I don't know which one to choose.

423
00:31:50,710 --> 00:31:52,380
Don't laugh.

Welcome.

426
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,780
Put it down.

427
00:32:40,740 --> 00:32:43,850
It is something with an ominous story.

428
00:32:43,850 --> 00:32:45,760
What's the story?

429
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:50,930
Its owner, because of his own adoration,

430
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:54,810
caused the kingdom to fall and the people to be sold.

431
00:32:54,810 --> 00:32:58,870
It carries the blood and tears of thousands of people.

432
00:32:58,870 --> 00:33:01,280
It is not a good thing.

433
00:33:01,280 --> 00:33:03,940
Then why do you put it up for sale?

434
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:06,920
Because it's time to return to its owner.

435
00:33:08,100 --> 00:33:13,940
Hope it won't be stained with its owner's blood.

436
00:33:28,120 --> 00:33:29,310
Have you chosen?

437
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:32,300
Yes.

438
00:33:32,300 --> 00:33:34,070
How about this photinia?

439
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,330
Photinia?

440
00:33:36,330 --> 00:33:39,530
When choosing a ring, the meaning is very important.

441
00:33:39,530 --> 00:33:43,060
Because photinia bloom in both the underworld and this world.

442
00:33:43,060 --> 00:33:45,410
It should be a witness to your lifelong agreement.

443
00:33:49,930 --> 00:33:51,350
Forever.

444
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:59,340
Hope you will pass by like water and wind in an instant.

445
00:33:59,340 --> 00:34:02,740
That's the way to have a good destiny.

446
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:06,920
If it's just a momentary passing, I won't start it.

447
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,340
I love it.

448
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,940
Thank you, Yeong.

449
00:34:13,940 --> 00:34:15,370
You're welcome.

450
00:34:15,370 --> 00:34:20,020
I'm so happy to have Seol Hui as my family.

451
00:34:22,210 --> 00:34:23,760
This is for you.

452
00:34:25,179 --> 00:34:26,800
It's not family yet.

453
00:34:31,980 --> 00:34:34,590
Still so stupid.

454
00:34:47,659 --> 00:34:49,060
O Yeong.

455
00:34:52,130 --> 00:34:53,570
My brother.

456
00:34:55,790 --> 00:34:57,190
Come in, come in.

457
00:34:57,190 --> 00:34:59,140
Watch your step. Don't fall down!

458
00:35:00,750 --> 00:35:02,040
You're back.

459
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:05,300
Why does the house look like this?
There are minefields everywhere.

460
00:35:07,460 --> 00:35:08,130
It doesn’t matter.

461
00:35:08,130 --> 00:35:09,440
I care.

462
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:12,080
Mr. Jeong I-deun.

-What?

464
00:35:16,980 --> 00:35:18,610
What are you looking at? Sit down.

465
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:24,160
What's going on here?

466
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:28,090
What? Are you uncomfortable?

467
00:35:28,090 --> 00:35:29,240
Do you want a new couch?

468
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,600
Why don't I replace all those for you?

469
00:35:31,600 --> 00:35:32,830
No need.

470
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:35,130
I'm feeling better. I should go back.

471
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:37,660
Where? Don't you know how dangerous it is outside?

472
00:35:37,660 --> 00:35:39,310
Make yourself at home here.

473
00:35:39,310 --> 00:35:40,900
It's my home!

474
00:35:40,900 --> 00:35:43,320
Is this a shelter for lost children?

475
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:45,290
Why are there more and more children?

476
00:35:49,480 --> 00:35:52,230
If you have guests, tell me in advance.

477
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:53,720
I told you that there's no room.

478
00:35:53,720 --> 00:35:54,980
Why is there no room?

479
00:35:54,980 --> 00:35:56,050
There's a room for me, isn't there?

480
00:35:56,050 --> 00:35:57,180
We can use it together.

481
00:35:57,180 --> 00:35:58,290
My room, my bed!

482
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,780
Deity.

483
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:01,150
What's wrong?

484
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:05,490
Autumn seems to be the season
for general paralysis, right?

485
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,340
No. The autumn sky is clear and the air is crisp and cool.
(Note: "Paralysis" and "Nice autumn day" are homophones.)

486
00:36:10,010 --> 00:36:15,810
General paralysis.

487
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:20,900
Really? It's the first time I've heard of it.

488
00:36:26,070 --> 00:36:29,540
Who's going to sleep in the bed I've never slept in?

489
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:31,260
Why is he pretending to be close to him all of a sudden?

490
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,760
Is he out of his mind?

491
00:36:43,750 --> 00:36:45,810
Is he demonstrating to me?

492
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:49,730
Did I let him go too far?

493
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:54,970
Should I treat you hotly for once?

494
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,160
Let a patient sleep on the couch?

495
00:36:58,160 --> 00:36:59,900
If it was her brother, would she do that?

496
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:02,900
So we sent a bodyguard to take him to the hotel.

497
00:37:02,900 --> 00:37:05,060
What a lack of humanity!

498
00:37:05,060 --> 00:37:07,960
That’s true.

499
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:10,680
This is the first time I saw Jeong I-deun.

500
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:14,030
He is so handsome.

501
00:37:15,080 --> 00:37:18,920
His fair skin and moose eyes.

502
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:21,290
The corner of the mouth that laughs at others is also very charming.

503
00:37:21,290 --> 00:37:23,140
Who are you coveting?

504
00:37:23,140 --> 00:37:26,570
You're thousand years older than me, right?

505
00:37:26,570 --> 00:37:28,440
How dare you lust after my Yeong?

506
00:37:28,440 --> 00:37:29,480
No way!

507
00:37:29,480 --> 00:37:32,590
Even if I die, you can't!

508
00:37:32,590 --> 00:37:37,120
Pour the water at this time. It is the basic operation.

509
00:37:37,120 --> 00:37:39,200
Basic operation? Then I’ll follow it.

510
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:40,520
I didn't mean that.

511
00:37:40,520 --> 00:37:42,260
I'm just kidding.

512
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:46,560
Lord Deity, looking at you like this,
you must be very close to each other.

513
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:49,490
Our Yeong very likes his brother.

514
00:37:49,490 --> 00:37:52,130
He has a lot of talent, and he’s good at
writing poems.

515
00:37:52,130 --> 00:37:53,130
Writing poems.

516
00:37:53,130 --> 00:37:54,860
Is he good at writing poems?

517
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,110
Let’s search online?

518
00:37:56,110 --> 00:37:57,630
Okay.

519
00:37:57,630 --> 00:37:58,800
O Yeong.

520
00:38:00,210 --> 00:38:01,470
Oh, there it is.

521
00:38:01,470 --> 00:38:02,390
Really?

522
00:38:02,390 --> 00:38:04,450
O Yeong, a literary minister in the Goryeo era,

523
00:38:04,450 --> 00:38:06,780
specializes in love poems about unattainable love.

524
00:38:06,780 --> 00:38:09,100
He was named the best literati of the time.

525
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,710
Oh, good, he's been writing love poems all along.

526
00:38:11,710 --> 00:38:12,670
He's much better than his brother.

527
00:38:12,670 --> 00:38:14,570
His brother doesn't even
have a line of introduction in the history.

528
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:22,290
Keep reading.

529
00:38:22,290 --> 00:38:25,000
Although some people say that he was
the author of the Goryeo song Full of Spring.

530
00:38:27,840 --> 00:38:29,150
That's it.

531
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:31,610
What? Did he plagiarize?

532
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:32,690
No, that's it.

533
00:38:32,690 --> 00:38:36,060
Let me see. Why did you stop in the middle?

534
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,060
Why did you stop in the middle?

535
00:38:38,060 --> 00:38:40,430
To help his brother who
was fighting against the Yuan Dynasty,

536
00:38:43,640 --> 00:38:46,150
he was executed at the execution site.

537
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:49,250
So, none of his poem has been passed down.

538
00:38:53,530 --> 00:38:57,470
Did I fight against the Yuan Dynasty?

539
00:38:59,020 --> 00:39:02,210
So I let him die?

540
00:39:03,590 --> 00:39:05,730
He didn't even leave a poem he liked.

541
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:10,740
There should have been that kind of time.

542
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,670
Anyone in their right mind would have fought against it.

543
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:17,750
So, Lord Deity, don't blame yourself too much.

544
00:39:17,750 --> 00:39:20,400
If he is unfortunate because of me,

545
00:39:22,470 --> 00:39:26,130
I should not know him in this life.

546
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:36,790
Autumn night, two people.

547
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,100
Aphrodisiac.

548
00:39:41,340 --> 00:39:43,990
Deity, you're finished.

549
00:39:53,020 --> 00:39:56,710
Lord Deity, but it's a blessing.

550
00:39:56,710 --> 00:39:58,140
Lord Deity,

551
00:39:58,140 --> 00:40:02,010
you won’t have time to bring him bad luck in this life.

552
00:40:02,010 --> 00:40:04,010
There are less than 20 days left before you disappear,

553
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:05,300
what else can happen during this time?

554
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,320
What do you mean?

555
00:40:19,400 --> 00:40:22,560
Disappear? Less than 20 days left.

556
00:40:23,430 --> 00:40:26,220
I think you misheard. We didn't say anything like that.

557
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:28,720
Is that what you wanted to confess to me?

558
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:29,960
To disappear?

559
00:40:34,430 --> 00:40:36,730
I thought it was a marriage proposal.

560
00:40:38,230 --> 00:40:41,940
If you knew I was mistaken,
you should have told me clearly.

561
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:45,190
Tell me, are you really going to disappear?

562
00:40:49,110 --> 00:40:50,330
Well, Dr. Han,

563
00:40:52,130 --> 00:40:54,580
our Deity,

564
00:40:54,580 --> 00:40:55,830
is going to study abroad,

565
00:40:57,660 --> 00:40:59,690
in 20 days . You just have to know it.

566
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:00,820
I Eung-chul!

567
00:41:00,820 --> 00:41:03,010
Aren't you always mentally unstable?

568
00:41:03,010 --> 00:41:05,270
How can you live with us like this?

569
00:41:05,270 --> 00:41:06,730
Because you're mentally unstable,

570
00:41:06,730 --> 00:41:09,100
she thinks you're going to disappear and feels uncertain, right?

571
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,380
That's why we talked about it, isn't it?

572
00:41:11,380 --> 00:41:12,870
After all, you're going to disappear.

573
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,520
Dr. Han needs to be prepared for that, right?

574
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:19,180
Then you won't regret it.

575
00:41:24,420 --> 00:41:26,690
Is that so?

576
00:41:26,690 --> 00:41:27,420
No.

577
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,590
No? You're not going to disappear? Are you sure?

578
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:40,830
At least you should have told me yourself.

579
00:41:40,830 --> 00:41:42,700
That's basic courtesy.

580
00:41:45,210 --> 00:41:46,860
You're really out of line.

581
00:41:53,490 --> 00:41:54,810
Just leave her alone for a while.

582
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:56,160
Why are you...

583
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,030
getting involved in our business?
Who are you?

584
00:41:59,030 --> 00:42:02,220
Lord Deity, what do you want to do?

585
00:42:02,220 --> 00:42:05,590
You knew you would disappear and you started it anyway.
Then you should do it at the end.

586
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:06,910
Even if you disappear, Lord Deity,

587
00:42:06,910 --> 00:42:10,410
It will be better for Han Gye-jeol to think
that you're alive somewhere.

588
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:12,590
It's better than telling her you're going to die, right?

589
00:42:18,570 --> 00:42:21,930
How to know when you'll disappear? Who knows?

590
00:42:24,060 --> 00:42:28,510
I'm also a doctor. I've searched through the files.

591
00:42:32,140 --> 00:42:36,000
No. The person in question knows it?

592
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,300
I think there's something like that before.

593
00:42:54,550 --> 00:42:57,520
Crazy, is there a beggar living in my stomach?

594
00:43:00,790 --> 00:43:04,050
Hey, as a tenant, do you have no conscience?

595
00:43:12,370 --> 00:43:16,790
Well, let's eat and live together.

596
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:22,270
My phone.

597
00:43:26,090 --> 00:43:27,160
Wallet.

598
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:30,960
I have none of them.

599
00:43:42,520 --> 00:43:45,170
A fortune from heaven? Is that you, Deity?

600
00:43:59,540 --> 00:44:03,490
Excuse me, the money fell on the floor here.

601
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,020
Does it have an owner?

602
00:44:10,580 --> 00:44:13,550
If not, I'll take it.

603
00:44:15,710 --> 00:44:17,410
I'll really take it.

604
00:44:22,450 --> 00:44:23,980
Taxi! Taxi!

605
00:44:45,630 --> 00:44:47,070
How can the taste be so fine?

606
00:44:47,070 --> 00:44:49,960
Just remove the yolk and sift it.

607
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:52,990
How do you know this as a man?
It's amazing.

608
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:54,780
Because my mother died a long time ago,

609
00:44:54,780 --> 00:44:57,090
when I was hungry, I would make my own food.

610
00:44:57,090 --> 00:44:59,140
I think you're even more amazing, Jeong-won.

611
00:45:01,370 --> 00:45:03,000
What's so amazing?

612
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,030
How did you manage to get the saltiness just right?

613
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:09,190
You're so good at cooking when all you do is study.

614
00:45:12,820 --> 00:45:15,370
I look like a stubborn old man, right?

615
00:45:15,370 --> 00:45:16,860
If you're good-looking and you're a good student,

616
00:45:16,860 --> 00:45:18,660
it's just basic that you're a good cook.

617
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,010
My mother died a long time ago

618
00:45:23,110 --> 00:45:24,770
because of domestic violence from my dad.

619
00:45:26,210 --> 00:45:28,450
I was the one who called the police.

620
00:45:29,530 --> 00:45:31,800
I told them everything.

621
00:45:32,960 --> 00:45:35,340
Thanks to that, my father spent a long time in jail.

622
00:45:37,080 --> 00:45:38,320
Because no one helped me,

623
00:45:38,320 --> 00:45:40,760
I cooked for myself to survive.

624
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:46,160
Why are you talking about this all of a sudden?

625
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,120
Do you still like me like this?

626
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,840
Yes, I do.

627
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:54,130
Yes,

628
00:45:54,130 --> 00:45:57,430
everyone's like that at first.

629
00:45:57,430 --> 00:46:00,730
But when you really meet my father,
you'll change your mind.

630
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:03,060
Because you can't handle it.

631
00:46:03,060 --> 00:46:07,130
How can I be a cop if I can't handle that?

632
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:08,580
Do you have confidence?

633
00:46:08,580 --> 00:46:09,880
You'll see.

634
00:46:09,880 --> 00:46:11,090
And then you'll know what kind of person I am,

635
00:46:11,090 --> 00:46:13,730
and know my feelings...

636
00:46:13,730 --> 00:46:15,360
For you.

637
00:46:17,110 --> 00:46:18,600
Passed.

638
00:46:18,600 --> 00:46:19,920
What?

639
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:23,720
Sorry, that was all a lie.

640
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,550
Why did you lie to me?

641
00:46:27,550 --> 00:46:29,580
I was just testing you.

642
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,940
At least you should have the courage
and sincerity to fall in love with me.

643
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:38,190
You're not angry for that, are you?

644
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,780
Not for something like this...

645
00:46:42,780 --> 00:46:44,240
Really?

646
00:46:45,110 --> 00:46:47,660
You have sent your father to prison.

647
00:46:47,660 --> 00:46:49,860
Aren't you ready for this?

648
00:46:49,860 --> 00:46:52,100
Don't threaten me.

649
00:46:52,100 --> 00:46:56,040
I'm not like my mother you always bullied.

650
00:46:56,040 --> 00:46:59,220
Wow, I'm not very good at being tested.

651
00:46:59,220 --> 00:47:00,540
But I've passed.

652
00:47:00,540 --> 00:47:02,220
That's great.

653
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,280
Try this before you test me.

654
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:18,680
Passed.

655
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:20,560
Kimchi soup will taste better
if you cook it again.

656
00:47:20,560 --> 00:47:22,740
Why not leave after eating tomorrow morning?

657
00:47:22,740 --> 00:47:24,550
What?

658
00:47:24,550 --> 00:47:26,820
Are you trying to seduce me
to spend the night here

659
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:28,750
just with this kimchi soup?

660
00:47:28,750 --> 00:47:30,320
I’m Tae Jeong-won.

661
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,230
I just want to make breakfast for you.

662
00:47:33,230 --> 00:47:34,380
I really don't have any bad ideas.

663
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:35,450
I won't lay a finger on you.

664
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:36,670
I swear to you.

665
00:47:37,470 --> 00:47:39,920
Han Chul, are you a high school student?

666
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:42,350
Or a married man?

667
00:47:42,350 --> 00:47:43,230
What?

668
00:47:43,230 --> 00:47:46,900
Why not lay a finger on me?

669
00:47:46,900 --> 00:47:48,290
It really hurts my self-esteem.

670
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:50,900
I'm going to clean up the room.

671
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,270
Just a moment. One minute!

672
00:47:54,270 --> 00:47:55,820
No, one second. You can't leave.

673
00:47:57,610 --> 00:48:00,650
Chul, let’s eat together.

674
00:48:04,440 --> 00:48:05,760
Who is that?

675
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:11,890
Your sister?

676
00:48:11,890 --> 00:48:13,770
Wait for me for a while, and I'll
send her out right away.

677
00:48:24,110 --> 00:48:25,220
Eh.

678
00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:29,420
Hey, can you contact me in advance
when you come to my house?

679
00:48:29,420 --> 00:48:30,900
When did it become your house?

680
00:48:30,900 --> 00:48:32,590
When you took the liberty of
living together with another man,

681
00:48:32,590 --> 00:48:35,230
I've given up on you at that time.

682
00:48:35,230 --> 00:48:38,540
So you're also living together without permission?

683
00:48:39,940 --> 00:48:42,000
What are you talking about?

684
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:43,810
I heard a woman's voice.

685
00:48:43,810 --> 00:48:46,330
And the sound is very loud.

686
00:48:46,330 --> 00:48:49,220
It's the sound of the TV. Isn't the
sound-proofing of this house bad?

687
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:53,450
It turns out that your TV can wear high heels.

688
00:48:53,450 --> 00:48:54,510
What?

689
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:57,410
Is that pair of shoes yours?

690
00:48:57,410 --> 00:49:01,250
If it's yours, talk to me.

691
00:49:02,220 --> 00:49:05,400
-Excuse me.
-Okay.

692
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:07,330
It’s a woman. What do you want to do?

693
00:49:07,330 --> 00:49:11,090
If you think about what you've done
to me, you'll see what I want to do.

694
00:49:11,090 --> 00:49:13,830
-Sister-in-law, let's meet and greet each other.
-Did I make any mistake?

695
00:49:13,830 --> 00:49:18,100
-Sister-in-law.
-Just say hello, that's easy.

696
00:49:18,100 --> 00:49:19,050
She is too drunk to get up.

697
00:49:19,050 --> 00:49:20,850
So stop it, okay?

698
00:49:20,850 --> 00:49:22,140
Do you believe your words?

699
00:49:22,140 --> 00:49:25,130
-Sister-in-law.
-Han Gye-jeol, you're really annoying.

700
00:49:26,840 --> 00:49:28,200
Han Gye-jeol?

701
00:49:28,200 --> 00:49:28,980
What to do...

702
00:49:28,980 --> 00:49:32,010
Han Gye-jeol, you're really annoying.

703
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:33,510
Sister-in-law.

704
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:35,830
Let go of me.

705
00:49:35,830 --> 00:49:38,800
Sister-in-law.

706
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:41,400
I'm in, sister-in-law.

707
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:10,760
I'm watching my sister now.

708
00:50:10,760 --> 00:50:12,050
Jeong-won, hurry home.

709
00:50:12,050 --> 00:50:13,200
I'm sorry.

710
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:24,680
Has she left?

711
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:25,580
What are you talking about?

712
00:50:25,580 --> 00:50:29,310
Didn't you pull me out so she could leave?

713
00:50:29,310 --> 00:50:31,130
It's so sold.

714
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:32,820
Yeah. Can't I do that?

715
00:50:32,820 --> 00:50:36,740
Why don't you trust me and make it so awkward?

716
00:50:36,740 --> 00:50:38,830
I trust you. I totally trust you.

717
00:50:38,830 --> 00:50:42,050
Did your girlfriend spill the wine on her body?

718
00:50:42,050 --> 00:50:44,500
The smell of alcohol in your room
just now is terrible.

719
00:50:44,500 --> 00:50:46,280
Are you scolding my girlfriend?

720
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:48,920
Well, my little Chul has grown up,

721
00:50:48,920 --> 00:50:50,780
and can protect his girlfriend.

722
00:50:53,450 --> 00:50:55,210
Do you expect me to say that?

723
00:50:55,210 --> 00:50:57,540
I scolded her. So what?

724
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,070
I'll show her the strength of her sister-in-law.

725
00:51:01,070 --> 00:51:03,860
And I'll show her my power.

726
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:05,160
Why?

727
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:08,140
You're not alone. You have me behind you.

728
00:51:08,140 --> 00:51:11,090
I have to give her a good test so that
she won't treat you casually.

729
00:51:11,090 --> 00:51:13,820
Who said that to me?

730
00:51:13,820 --> 00:51:15,950
Who dares to treat me casually?
Leave me alone.

731
00:51:15,950 --> 00:51:19,160
Is that why you were bullied
and got betrayed?

732
00:51:19,160 --> 00:51:21,450
I can't ignore it.

733
00:51:21,450 --> 00:51:23,810
Is that why you installed the APP
in my phone without permission?

734
00:51:23,810 --> 00:51:25,900
Yes.

735
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,550
You even dare to install the
positioning APP. Unload it for me.

736
00:51:28,550 --> 00:51:31,720
No, at least I'll be relieved with that
in your phone.

737
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:33,450
Hey, I'm not gonna die.

738
00:51:33,450 --> 00:51:35,650
If I die, how can I stand your torture?

739
00:51:35,650 --> 00:51:38,200
That's not something you can control.
Can you control it?

740
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,880
Why? Why are you losing your temper?

741
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:43,470
Anyway, try disappear, you will see.

742
00:51:43,470 --> 00:51:45,610
I will never forgive you.

743
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:47,610
I really can't stand it.

744
00:51:47,610 --> 00:51:49,380
Do you think of mother again?

745
00:51:49,380 --> 00:51:50,700
Don't hate her anymore.

746
00:51:52,850 --> 00:51:53,950
When did I hate her?

747
00:51:53,950 --> 00:51:55,740
You think I don't know that?

748
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:57,760
You hate her as much as you want to see her.

749
00:52:00,290 --> 00:52:02,740
Mom might want to see us, too.

750
00:52:02,740 --> 00:52:08,110
She wants to see all the moments
when we're 20 or 30.

751
00:52:08,110 --> 00:52:10,770
If she can stay with us,

752
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:14,500
mom must be able to do everything she can.

753
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,900
Yeah, I'm sure she can do everything
she is able to do.

754
00:52:27,540 --> 00:52:29,980
It's because she's that kind of person
that I can't forget her.

755
00:52:32,090 --> 00:52:33,710
That's why I miss her.

756
00:52:44,830 --> 00:52:47,630
How long do you have to live
before you have a good judgement?

757
00:52:47,630 --> 00:52:50,290
How long do you want me
to clean up your mess?

758
00:52:52,940 --> 00:52:53,860
Dr. Han.

759
00:52:56,020 --> 00:52:57,210
Why do you come back alone?

760
00:52:57,210 --> 00:52:58,710
Where is Lord Deity?

761
00:52:58,710 --> 00:53:01,510
Deity is not at home?

762
00:53:01,510 --> 00:53:02,960
I haven't seen him since early this morning.

763
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:04,290
Aren't you two together?

764
00:53:09,810 --> 00:53:13,470
Deity.

765
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:17,380
Deity.

766
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,530
Deity.

767
00:53:33,570 --> 00:53:35,990
Deity, where are you?

768
00:53:37,860 --> 00:53:39,910
Hey, you bastard.

769
00:53:39,910 --> 00:53:42,680
You're not leaving so soon, right?

770
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:51,160
What can I do?

771
00:53:52,290 --> 00:53:53,970
What to do?

772
00:53:56,280 --> 00:53:57,680
Where can I go?

773
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,750
You... Ah, slow down.

774
00:54:28,640 --> 00:54:30,990
You usually hug on the steps?

775
00:54:30,990 --> 00:54:32,270
You like that?

776
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:41,720
This one and that one. I like different things.

777
00:54:41,720 --> 00:54:45,070
If you want to know my preferences,
it will take a long time to observe.

778
00:54:45,070 --> 00:54:49,550
Long time? How long? Is 500 years enough?

779
00:54:49,550 --> 00:54:51,320
Don't joke.

780
00:54:52,900 --> 00:54:55,660
Human beings' time is sadly short.

781
00:54:55,660 --> 00:54:59,760
For a hundred years of joy, they need to
gamble on thousands of years of pain.

782
00:54:59,760 --> 00:55:01,750
It is not a fair deal for me.

783
00:55:01,750 --> 00:55:03,900
What do you mean?

784
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:05,290
You'll know when we're there.

785
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:21,620
It's such a boring alley, isn't it?

786
00:55:23,550 --> 00:55:24,970
I think it is beautiful.

787
00:55:24,970 --> 00:55:26,810
That's it.

788
00:55:26,810 --> 00:55:30,530
A boring yet beautiful alley is rare.

789
00:55:30,530 --> 00:55:32,990
It's a hard place to find and I found it.

790
00:55:32,990 --> 00:55:35,490
It took me the whole morning.

791
00:55:35,490 --> 00:55:37,590
Did you say you went to find the alley?

792
00:55:37,590 --> 00:55:39,330
Why?

793
00:55:39,330 --> 00:55:42,700
How can I only find the alley?

794
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:53,100
Following him, I saw a very ordinary alley.

795
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:54,040
(Gold store, Yuelao)
Following him, I saw a very ordinary alley.

796
00:55:54,040 --> 00:55:55,980
There is a small gold shop.
(Gold store, Yuelao)

797
00:55:57,800 --> 00:56:03,910
The gold shop is full of wall clocks
that I don't know where to use.

798
00:56:03,910 --> 00:56:10,020
I want each other to wear with no brand...no decoration...

799
00:56:10,020 --> 00:56:13,720
An ordinary thread ring.

800
00:56:13,720 --> 00:56:16,550
Get an ordinary confession.

801
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:23,170
You're now... Are you planning to propose

802
00:56:23,170 --> 00:56:26,200
and get married in 20 days...
Do you want to do everything that others have done?

803
00:56:27,990 --> 00:56:30,720
20 days is too short.

804
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,020
Propose, get married...

805
00:56:33,020 --> 00:56:34,910
Have a baby...

806
00:56:34,910 --> 00:56:38,460
Your 40s, 50s.

807
00:56:38,460 --> 00:56:41,010
I want to see all these moments.

808
00:56:41,010 --> 00:56:42,700
20 days is not enough.

809
00:56:45,800 --> 00:56:47,490
I won't disappear so easily.

810
00:56:47,490 --> 00:56:48,760
Han Gye-jeol.

811
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:55,680
I...

812
00:56:58,620 --> 00:57:01,580
I started dating you after I knew
what kind of person you are.

813
00:57:03,010 --> 00:57:04,900
If we break up,

814
00:57:04,900 --> 00:57:10,170
yes, I must feel sad, but it's bearable.

815
00:57:10,170 --> 00:57:14,150
But if you give me hope like this

816
00:57:14,150 --> 00:57:16,330
and then take it back,

817
00:57:17,540 --> 00:57:19,700
I will really fall down at that time.

818
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:25,750
So tell me honestly.

819
00:57:25,750 --> 00:57:27,790
Don't make me dream.

820
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,120
I'll be with you.

821
00:57:36,050 --> 00:57:40,230
To see my kids in their 20s and 30s.

822
00:57:43,400 --> 00:57:47,740
Really?

823
00:57:47,740 --> 00:57:50,620
But there is a condition.

824
00:57:50,620 --> 00:57:53,410
Even if I become a horrible monster,

825
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,450
don't abandon me.

826
00:58:31,560 --> 00:58:32,590
Give me your hand.

827
00:58:57,360 --> 00:59:01,000
Thread ring... You have to understand

828
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,090
that I also have my own preference.

829
00:59:04,090 --> 00:59:05,940
I cannot stand it

830
00:59:05,940 --> 00:59:07,610
if you wear a ring but others cannot see.

831
00:59:28,900 --> 00:59:31,410
Ah, is it because he has once lived in America?

832
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:33,840
How could he like this?

833
00:59:34,850 --> 00:59:38,080
This is the type I will like
after looking at it for long.

834
00:59:39,430 --> 00:59:40,860
What does he know?

835
00:59:40,860 --> 00:59:43,700
Why can't you understand
the deep meaning of Mr. Johns?

836
00:59:43,700 --> 00:59:45,800
You will live together for a long time

837
00:59:45,800 --> 00:59:47,650
until you're 80 or even 100 years old.

838
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:50,120
Isn't that what it means?

839
00:59:53,240 --> 00:59:54,470
Yes.

840
00:59:55,710 --> 00:59:57,810
Why did he say that

841
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:00,070
he wanted to see her in her 40s and 50s?

842
01:00:00,070 --> 01:00:04,150
How is that possible? It's not a trick.

843
01:00:04,150 --> 01:00:05,840
I'm not going to the underworld.

844
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:06,700
What?

845
01:00:06,700 --> 01:00:08,560
Do you say you won't go?

846
01:00:08,560 --> 01:00:10,800
How can you not go?

847
01:00:10,800 --> 01:00:15,050
As long as I don't open the door
to the underworld.

848
01:00:15,050 --> 01:00:18,450
When the time came, I went to
the underworld by myself.

849
01:00:19,330 --> 01:00:21,330
For life in the world was a punishment.

850
01:00:21,330 --> 01:00:25,000
I have never hesitated.

851
01:00:25,000 --> 01:00:27,220
But I'm not going this time.

852
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,570
I won't open the door myself.

853
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:33,600
You might die if you don't go.

854
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:36,440
Death was my first and only wish.

855
01:00:36,440 --> 01:00:38,840
He is not the one
who realizes my wish so easily.

856
01:00:38,840 --> 01:00:42,050
I don't know what kind of
misfortune awaits you.

857
01:00:42,050 --> 01:00:45,380
You might be whipped and worn out
during the period of thousands of years,

858
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:48,410
bearing the pain of bones being cut
day after day.

859
01:00:48,410 --> 01:00:50,410
You can't recognize your love.

860
01:00:50,410 --> 01:00:53,110
Or you will get hurt...
Even so, do you have to...

861
01:00:53,110 --> 01:00:54,710
Stay in the world?

862
01:00:56,990 --> 01:00:58,350
I have to try.

863
01:01:02,570 --> 01:01:04,420
Han Gye-jeol said something like that

864
01:01:06,850 --> 01:01:09,460
a firm effort,

865
01:01:09,460 --> 01:01:11,280
an honest effort.

866
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,250
Although summer is very short,

867
01:01:14,250 --> 01:01:17,950
just like cicadas believe that
summer is their all,

868
01:01:17,950 --> 01:01:19,990
believe that this moment is all the effort.

869
01:01:24,570 --> 01:01:26,960
Even human beings work so hard,

870
01:01:26,960 --> 01:01:29,570
how can God lose?

871
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:31,260
It may become unfortunate,

872
01:01:34,730 --> 01:01:36,120
but I won't run away.

873
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,840
Mom,

874
01:01:49,840 --> 01:01:52,530
I told you to rest at home.

875
01:01:52,530 --> 01:01:54,610
I just can't be idle.

876
01:02:03,660 --> 01:02:05,820
Do you still have those things
in the warehouse?

877
01:02:15,020 --> 01:02:17,700
What is that called?

878
01:02:20,120 --> 01:02:21,890
Fate.

879
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:31,030
AXIS is our hope. Cheer for Pilseong!

880
01:02:31,030 --> 01:02:32,060
Don't stop the new drug
from coming on the market.

881
01:02:32,060 --> 01:02:32,240
(AXIS is the hope. Don’t stop the new drug’s launch!
Stand with Pilseong.)
Don't stop the new drug
from coming on the market.

882
01:02:32,240 --> 01:02:33,710
We support Pilseong Company!
(AXIS is the hope. Don’t stop the new drug’s launch!
Stand with Pilseong.)

883
01:02:33,710 --> 01:02:33,860
(Fighting!)
We support Pilseong Company!
(AXIS is the hope. Don’t stop the new drug’s launch!
Stand with Pilseong.)

884
01:02:33,860 --> 01:02:36,350
Kim Pil-soo! Kim Pil-soo!
(Fighting!)

885
01:02:36,350 --> 01:02:39,400
Kim Pil-soo! Kim Pil-soo!

886
01:02:39,400 --> 01:02:41,430
-Kim Pil-soo! Kim Pil-soo!
-AXIS is our hope.

887
01:02:41,430 --> 01:02:41,800
(We have the right not to get sick!
We stand with Pilseong Bio.
The new drug AXIS is our hope!
Cheer for Pilseong Bio.)
-Kim Pil-soo! Kim Pil-soo!
-AXIS is our hope.

888
01:02:41,800 --> 01:02:43,190
-Never stop listing.
-Cheer for you!
(We have the right not to get sick!
We stand with Pilseong Bio.
The new drug AXIS is our hope!
Cheer for Pilseong Bio.)

889
01:02:43,190 --> 01:02:44,560
-Never stop listing.
-Cheer for you!

890
01:02:44,560 --> 01:02:46,220
-Cheer for you!
-Fighting!

891
01:02:46,220 --> 01:02:47,400
-Kim Pil-soo! Kim Pil-soo!
-Fighting!

892
01:02:47,400 --> 01:02:50,060
(Support Pilseong and let AXIS come to market!)
-Kim Pil-soo! Kim Pil-soo!
-Fighting!

893
01:02:52,310 --> 01:02:56,620
You said that monster took away Jeong I-deun.

894
01:02:56,620 --> 01:02:58,460
Why do you suddenly look for Jeong I-deun?

895
01:02:58,460 --> 01:03:00,690
You said you didn't care about him before.

896
01:03:00,690 --> 01:03:04,180
Does that matter now?
The man has been taken away.

897
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:06,390
Could it be that

898
01:03:06,390 --> 01:03:10,510
he already knew Jeong I-deun is Nam Se-ri?

899
01:03:10,510 --> 01:03:14,610
If Nam Se-ri is also made public,
not to mention the new drug, we’re all doomed.

900
01:03:14,610 --> 01:03:16,900
Anyway, I have to

901
01:03:16,900 --> 01:03:20,330
get Jeong I-deun back first.

902
01:03:20,330 --> 01:03:23,460
-It was wrong from the start.
-What?

903
01:03:23,460 --> 01:03:24,570
Cockroaches are laying eggs all the time.

904
01:03:24,570 --> 01:03:27,370
Just get rid of those eggs
and my house will be clean?

905
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,200
We should get rid of cockroaches.

906
01:03:33,420 --> 01:03:36,210
-She might be with a staff. With a staff.
-Now she has a baby.

907
01:03:36,210 --> 01:03:38,630
She has already given birth to a child.
Why not invite Aya to come and talk about it?

908
01:03:38,630 --> 01:03:38,730
(Ask Aya to come over and chat.)
She has already given birth to a child.
Why not invite Aya to come and talk about it?

909
01:03:38,730 --> 01:03:39,230
Invite Aya...
(Ask Aya to come over and chat.)

910
01:03:39,230 --> 01:03:39,840
Invite Aya...

911
01:03:39,840 --> 01:03:40,150
(Facilitated the collaboration between Help Me Find a House and You're My Destiny(?).)
Invite Aya...

912
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:40,700
(Facilitated the collaboration between Help Me Find a House and You're My Destiny(?).)

913
01:03:41,810 --> 01:03:44,850
Today, let's see the house of three generations

914
01:03:44,850 --> 01:03:47,460
living together...

915
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,390
Are you still doing it?

916
01:03:49,390 --> 01:03:51,650
You're not making hot sauce, are you?

917
01:03:51,650 --> 01:03:54,160
Hey, you think bibimbap is that easy?

918
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:56,810
Yeah, yeah, maybe.

919
01:04:04,200 --> 01:04:06,660
Deity, you received a message.

920
01:04:07,880 --> 01:04:08,900
Two!

921
01:04:08,900 --> 01:04:10,430
Delete it. It's all spam.

922
01:04:10,430 --> 01:04:12,090
Today we have invited two guests
who can enhance the aura.

923
01:04:12,090 --> 01:04:14,790
We don't envy Green Dragon and White Tiger at all.

924
01:04:14,790 --> 01:04:18,780
Two stylists, Jwa Chi-seon and
U Hui-seon, were invited.

925
01:04:19,960 --> 01:04:21,320
Welcome.

926
01:04:21,320 --> 01:04:23,940
-Hello.
-The house to see today is...

927
01:04:23,940 --> 01:04:24,950
What happened?

928
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:31,260
(If you want to save him, come alone.)

929
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:33,160
If you want to save him, come here alone.
(If you want to save him, come alone.)

930
01:04:33,160 --> 01:04:34,900
This madman.

931
01:04:34,900 --> 01:04:36,150
Where are you going?

932
01:04:37,590 --> 01:04:41,080
I'll get my brother-in-law back
and you wait here.

933
01:04:41,080 --> 01:04:42,920
You don't know where he is.

934
01:04:42,920 --> 01:04:44,310
I...

935
01:04:44,310 --> 01:04:46,620
I installed a location APP on his phone.

936
01:04:46,620 --> 01:04:48,200
Use this to find him.

937
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:51,650
Give it to me. I will find him myself.

938
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,150
Let's go together.

939
01:04:54,150 --> 01:04:55,970
I don't know what will happen.
How can we go together?

940
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:57,520
He's my brother.

941
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,120
I don't know how he is now.

942
01:04:59,120 --> 01:05:01,640
Do you want me to wait here?

943
01:05:01,640 --> 01:05:03,780
I can't. Let's go together.

944
01:05:03,780 --> 01:05:05,430
Don't order me.

945
01:05:05,430 --> 01:05:06,910
Let's go together!

946
01:05:22,770 --> 01:05:24,870
Jesus Christ,

947
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:28,230
I don't know how to pray.

948
01:05:29,590 --> 01:05:32,890
But you already took mom.

949
01:05:32,890 --> 01:05:35,160
At least leave my brother with me.

950
01:05:36,710 --> 01:05:39,630
Then I'll never hate you again.

951
01:05:41,170 --> 01:05:42,660
Please.

952
01:06:44,170 --> 01:06:45,300
(My Chul)

953
01:07:09,270 --> 01:07:11,540
You stay here and I'll go by myself.

954
01:07:13,820 --> 01:07:16,330
No.

955
01:07:18,540 --> 01:07:19,790
Let's go together.

956
01:08:55,410 --> 01:08:57,140
What’s going on?

957
01:09:01,410 --> 01:09:03,340
Deity.

958
01:09:03,340 --> 01:09:04,720
Deity, your face.

959
01:09:23,040 --> 01:09:25,410
Disappear without anyone noticing.

960
01:09:25,410 --> 01:09:28,600
Just like instant movement.

961
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:01,890
At that moment, I understood.

962
01:10:01,890 --> 01:10:03,220
Maybe I

963
01:10:05,360 --> 01:10:07,310
have long guessed that.

964
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:22,460
There will be a day

965
01:10:22,460 --> 01:10:25,090
when the excitement in summer
and hope in autumn vanish,

966
01:10:26,310 --> 01:10:28,400
all that's left is ruins.

967
01:10:33,210 --> 01:10:34,990
That's season...

968
01:10:38,880 --> 01:10:40,140
It's winter now.

969
01:10:48,620 --> 01:10:50,930
(Episode 13 airs on Saturday, March 11 at 9:50 p.m.)

970
01:11:05,510 --> 01:11:10,060
(Next episode preview)

971
01:11:10,060 --> 01:11:12,150
You... Who are you?

972
01:11:12,150 --> 01:11:12,740
Deity.

973
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:14,780
Who exactly is Deity?

974
01:11:14,780 --> 01:11:16,460
Han Gye-jeol, don’t cry, please.

975
01:11:16,460 --> 01:11:20,130
Don’t touch me. I’m starting
to be afraid of you.

976
01:11:20,130 --> 01:11:22,610
Han Gye-jeol might look down on me.

977
01:11:22,610 --> 01:11:24,260
She doesn't remember Seol Hui.

978
01:11:24,260 --> 01:11:27,230
Is the woman you once loved Seol Hui?

979
01:11:27,230 --> 01:11:28,470
Do you remember something?

980
01:11:28,470 --> 01:11:31,800
Of course I remembered.
Why didn't I remember before?

981
01:11:31,800 --> 01:11:35,400
Please, I hope this life is different.
