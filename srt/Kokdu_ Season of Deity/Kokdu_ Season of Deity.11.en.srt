00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,410
(Episode 11)

2
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:49,410
Please watch carefully.

3
00:00:50,860 --> 00:00:52,990
Is that the guy who killed Black Bear Gang?

4
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,230
That guy...

5
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,140
Don't say anything, patient.

6
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,910
What are you doing? Get out of the way!

7
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,900
Detective Han Chul.

8
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:28,730
Didn't you say the witness would identify the killer?

9
00:01:28,730 --> 00:01:31,410
Yes, but now Dr. Han is interfering with the identification.

10
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,539
It seems to me that the police is forcing him to testify.

11
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:35,550
What?

12
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:38,729
Didn't you just ask a patient who just woke up from a coma

13
00:01:38,729 --> 00:01:41,330
if that man was the killer?

14
00:01:43,570 --> 00:01:46,530
As a doctor, I can't allow this

15
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:48,810
In Ma Sang-jin's current state, it's too hard for him to answer.

16
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:53,670
Do you really want to do this?

17
00:01:55,300 --> 00:01:57,520
If the judge asks you later,

18
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,720
I'll say that the patient was in a state in which he couldn't judge accurately.

19
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:04,430
If I do so, whether it's testimony or whatever, it will be invalid.

20
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:05,890
Even so, do you want to continue?

21
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:16,079
As far as I know.

22
00:02:16,079 --> 00:02:19,550
the professor is here as an informant.

23
00:02:19,550 --> 00:02:22,380
Did you tell him that the witness would identify the killer?

24
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,640
No, why?

25
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:26,650
I'm sure the legal team of the Bulhwa Company will stop it.
Can I tell him that?

26
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:28,950
How can it be effective if the procedure is wrong?

27
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,280
It's a good thing I stopped the witness.

28
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,650
If you're not careful, it'll be reported as an illegal investigation.

29
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,610
Do you want to be fired?

30
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:37,940
I did it because I wanted to catch the killer.

31
00:02:37,940 --> 00:02:39,790
I just want to catch the murderer.

32
00:02:39,790 --> 00:02:41,550
You're really going to get people killed.

33
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,460
Why would a plutocrat want to kill someone?

34
00:02:43,460 --> 00:02:44,090
Does it make sense?

35
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:47,329
He said he wanted to create a world where justice flows like a river.

36
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:50,360
Do you think it’s normal that a plutocrat in this world would say something like that?

37
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:54,040
Then show the evidence like a normal detective.

38
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:54,960
There's none.

39
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,960
How dare you say that if there’s none?

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:59,890
People are dying one by one, but there's no proof.

41
00:02:59,890 --> 00:03:03,080
We don't know how they were killed. We can't even guess the weapon.

42
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:06,560
Victims died in hotel, in hospital, and even in prison.

43
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,010
There's no trace of how the murderer got in or how he got out.

44
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:11,070
Does that make sense?

45
00:03:11,070 --> 00:03:12,390
It doesn't make sense.

46
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:14,440
But when I investigated the murder of Choe Gwang-mo,

47
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,370
I saw something unbelievable.

48
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:21,120
The murderer disappeared unnoticed.

49
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,930
It was like an instant movement.

50
00:03:22,930 --> 00:03:23,860
Instant... What?

51
00:03:23,860 --> 00:03:25,250
Maybe he has superpower,

52
00:03:25,250 --> 00:03:28,350
or maybe it's a secret military technology developed by a big corporation.

53
00:03:30,410 --> 00:03:32,210
How could you say that?

54
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:33,500
It's just suspicion.

55
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:36,670
Because my job is to suspect people.

56
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:40,390
Officer Han Chul, you really have a thorough professional awareness.

57
00:03:40,390 --> 00:03:43,630
What do superpowers have to do with the professor?

58
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,220
I'll show you.

59
00:03:53,630 --> 00:03:55,910
See? Instant movement.

60
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,750
I saw it. I saw the security camera was broken.

61
00:03:57,750 --> 00:03:59,690
The surveillance was working fine.

62
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:02,810
Then the Earth's magnetic field was wrong, no network, right?

63
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:06,960
Why am I talking to you right now?

64
00:04:08,470 --> 00:04:09,530
Stop dating that guy.

65
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,890
The witness is awake. It'll be over soon.

66
00:04:11,890 --> 00:04:13,540
Just bear for a few days.

67
00:04:13,540 --> 00:04:15,240
Why would I do that?

68
00:04:15,240 --> 00:04:16,450
Because I don't like you doing that.

69
00:04:18,670 --> 00:04:20,649
You're my only sister.

70
00:04:20,649 --> 00:04:22,530
I'm afraid something will happen to you.

71
00:04:28,420 --> 00:04:33,230
Even if I have a man, I won’t abandon you.

72
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:34,070
What?

73
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,210
Hey, are you crazy? Who are you playing with?

74
00:04:39,210 --> 00:04:41,340
We've always been dependent on each other.

75
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:44,830
If I have a man, you may have separation anxiety.

76
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:47,270
Your judgment may become clouded.

77
00:04:47,270 --> 00:04:49,900
I didn't think of that.

78
00:04:49,900 --> 00:04:52,620
So, it’s because I'm afraid of being abandoned by you,

79
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,450
I'm being anxious, and I'm being abnormal?

80
00:04:57,370 --> 00:05:00,970
Accept it. Sibling complex is not a sin.

81
00:05:02,380 --> 00:05:03,460
Get away.

82
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:07,680
My brother has a sibling complex...

83
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:08,680
Hey!

84
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:15,380
Bluebeard, don't you remember?

85
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:17,430
Didn't you read it to me when I was a kid?

86
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,620
What are you talking about?

87
00:05:18,620 --> 00:05:19,720
Even though she heard people say it was dangerous,

88
00:05:19,720 --> 00:05:21,890
the woman still live with that guy.

89
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,650
She never once suspected, but almost died.

90
00:05:25,650 --> 00:05:29,200
You even called that woman a fool.

91
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:30,480
Don't you think so now?

92
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,659
(Bluebeard)

93
00:05:42,350 --> 00:05:44,810
I can't believe you brought up a book you never mentioned.

94
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,060
Is there something wrong with him?

95
00:05:58,909 --> 00:06:00,020
It's Mr. Deity.

96
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:09,450
Hello?

97
00:06:09,450 --> 00:06:11,870
It's autumn. What are you doing?

98
00:06:11,870 --> 00:06:14,190
I'm reading a book because it's autumn.

99
00:06:14,190 --> 00:06:15,350
If people do something unusual,

100
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:17,460
something bad is bound to happen.

101
00:06:17,460 --> 00:06:19,860
I always keep books with me.

102
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:23,210
Really? What kind of books do you keep with you?

103
00:06:24,300 --> 00:06:26,170
It's Bluebeard.

104
00:06:26,170 --> 00:06:29,010
I seem to have superpower.

105
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:30,410
Superpower?

106
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:31,830
I can see when you're lying.

107
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:34,060
You're just holding the book, but you're not reading it.

108
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,940
What's going on?

109
00:06:46,210 --> 00:06:48,780
When did you get in the car? I didn't see you get in the car.

110
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:50,850
What? Do you really have superpowers?

111
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:52,030
Like instant movement?

112
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:54,120
You're the one with superpower.

113
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,860
What?

114
00:06:54,860 --> 00:06:56,090
Your soul can get out of your body, right?

115
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:57,350
Where did the soul go?

116
00:06:57,350 --> 00:07:00,950
You didn't even know that I was catching you up to get in the car with you.

117
00:07:00,950 --> 00:07:02,740
You did?

118
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,390
Where did you start to follow me?

119
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:05,760
The police station.

120
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:06,770
Why did you go there?

121
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:11,130
Are you there to see me?

122
00:07:15,730 --> 00:07:18,160
Didn't I tell you?

123
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,270
My brother works there.

124
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:26,470
That little brother with no manners?

125
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:28,240
We better not blame the family.

126
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,470
That damned brother! Brother!

127
00:07:29,470 --> 00:07:31,720
People who don't have a brother will be too sad to live.

128
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:33,320
If you don't have one, create one.

129
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:35,080
Aren't you a god? Can't you even create a brother?

130
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:38,720
If it were that simple, would the Creator live alone as an old man?

131
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:41,600
Family is a providence, that is, beyond the realm of God.

132
00:07:41,600 --> 00:07:43,420
You don't know anything and you're talking nonsense.

133
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:47,670
Nothing can be done well. God is not that great, huh.

134
00:07:47,670 --> 00:07:49,740
If I have known that you’re like this, I would let you unable to go home and wander around.

135
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:51,080
I really wasted my time.

136
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:54,580
I never dreamed that I would be insulted for being merciful.

137
00:07:54,580 --> 00:07:55,500
What?

138
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,680
This isn't the bus to your home. You took the wrong bus.

139
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:01,760
(Terminal Pyeongchang-dong Resident Center)

140
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:04,870
No, it's to Pyeongchang-dong.

141
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,710
Pyeongchang-dong is my home.

142
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:11,490
Then let's go back to our home.

143
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:22,560
Fine.

144
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:27,970
You mean our home?

145
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:32,510
What?

146
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,760
-Is that yours? - Yes.

147
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,770
I'm hungry.

148
00:08:43,799 --> 00:08:47,460
This, this, and...

149
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,730
And this.

150
00:08:56,450 --> 00:08:58,850
What else should I buy? This?

151
00:08:58,850 --> 00:09:01,950
It's an instant movement, right?

152
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:06,060
Who can eat all of this?

153
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:06,800
You.

154
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:08,360
I'm not an elephant.

155
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:09,330
Are you looking down on elephants?

156
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,210
Elephants’ stomach doesn't make that kind of noise.

157
00:09:11,210 --> 00:09:14,020
I’m not an elephant, so why should I only eat vegetables?

158
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:15,280
Vegetables?

159
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,520
Leeks, onions…

160
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,610
Wait, why do you have to buy so many potatoes and groundnuts?

161
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:21,070
Is it a bad year?

162
00:09:21,070 --> 00:09:23,350
You're researching a crop for the famine?

163
00:09:23,350 --> 00:09:26,410
Of course, people need to eat meat.

164
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:26,710
(Frozen Food Eggs Fresh Food)
Of course, people need to eat meat.

00:09:32,010 --> 00:09:35,400
I've never picked meat before.

167
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,610
(1 grade Korean beef 100g 17,000 won)

168
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:39,710
(Imported beef 100g 4,000 won)

169
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:52,370
You know, the inner peace comes from beef, right?

170
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,920
Look at the texture of this beef, how smooth it is.

171
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,280
He's a plutocrat. I think he'll spend the money.

172
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,220
I don't want to buy it.

173
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:09,460
If you want to buy beef, buy Korean beef.

174
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,700
Didn't you say you didn't want to buy it?

175
00:10:10,700 --> 00:10:12,670
I mean I don't want to see the blood in the meat.

176
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:22,110
The blood is really tender and the liver is very fragrant.

177
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:23,670
I said no.

178
00:10:23,670 --> 00:10:28,180
Aye! You do not like blood, huh?

179
00:10:28,180 --> 00:10:30,670
Then I'll eat it all and help you eat it.

180
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,670
This kind of person is said to be a murderer?

181
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,740
Han Chul, he really got things wrong...

182
00:10:43,960 --> 00:10:44,790
You take the cart.

183
00:10:46,700 --> 00:10:48,720
It must be delicious.

184
00:10:55,260 --> 00:10:56,220
Birthday present?

185
00:10:56,220 --> 00:10:58,740
Well, if you want anything, just ask.

186
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:01,830
It's been a long time since my birthday.

187
00:11:01,830 --> 00:11:03,800
I'll take it.

188
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:07,940
Softeners...

189
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,870
Why did you buy that? Don't you have any at home?

190
00:11:09,870 --> 00:11:12,760
There’re only softeners with musk scent at home, but what I use is with fruit scent.

191
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:16,260
You don't use shampoo, but you do use softener.

192
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,310
You're really looking for a fight.

193
00:11:18,310 --> 00:11:19,360
That's good.

194
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,640
You don't like that, do you?

195
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:25,420
It's you I like.

196
00:11:28,590 --> 00:11:32,970
They say preferences change over time.

197
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,840
Of course they do.

198
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,300
I’ll change my preference from young Han Gye-jeol to old Han Gye-jeol.

199
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:45,630
From love to friendship to worry, your heart will change too, right?

200
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:50,680
Will you get hungry somewhere? Will you cry after being cheated?

201
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:53,750
If you can't see it, you'll care about it. You can't get rid of it.

202
00:11:56,540 --> 00:12:01,190
Just enjoy the passing of the years.

203
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:03,200
It's good to grow old together.

204
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:08,710
Then let's do that.

205
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:13,250
Growing old together is not that difficult.

206
00:12:18,310 --> 00:12:20,680
Growing old is easy.

207
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,180
But it's hard to grow old together.

208
00:12:26,450 --> 00:12:29,310
The time we can spend together

209
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,540
is only twenty-seven days.

210
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:36,780
Isn't it obvious that she's not interested in you?

211
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:37,900
I'm not trying to pester her.

212
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,360
I'm just trying to apologize to her.

213
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:41,950
She doesn't have time to accept your apology right now anyway.

214
00:12:41,950 --> 00:12:45,890
She's busy on a blind date.

215
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,950
A blind date? In such a sudden?

216
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:49,240
What's so sudden about it?

217
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:52,270
With her face and work, it would be strange if she didn't go on a blind date.

218
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:54,760
It's because you've been pestering her these days,

219
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:57,350
she postponed it for a while.

220
00:12:57,350 --> 00:12:59,440
Why does she go on a new date when she has already postponed one?

221
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:02,120
Why are you suddenly angry with me?

222
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,030
I'm sorry.

223
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:06,910
I didn't want to talk about it.

224
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:09,720
Jeong-won said that if you call her again.

225
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,730
She'll call the police and say you're a stalker.

226
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:19,490
A stalker?

227
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,980
Hey, but I feel like a stalker is a bit too much.

228
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:40,040
I know him.

229
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:42,350
He really hates criminals.

230
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:44,350
That's the only way he won't contact me again.

231
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,420
Poor girl, I thought you had a crush on him before.

232
00:13:49,420 --> 00:13:52,670
What's the problem? Why are you doing this again?

233
00:13:52,670 --> 00:13:55,490
It's a habit to stop contacting.

234
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:59,990
The best thing to do is not to get involved with him before I die of anger.

235
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:03,380
Besides, having a father like that, it's not good to date with a cop.

236
00:14:05,050 --> 00:14:09,080
Why would your father ruin his daughter's life like this?

237
00:14:12,190 --> 00:14:13,340
It's okay.

238
00:14:13,340 --> 00:14:15,300
I ruined his life too.

239
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:19,950
What? A stalker? That’s nonsense.

240
00:14:19,950 --> 00:14:20,870
Stalker? What's wrong with stalker?

241
00:14:20,870 --> 00:14:21,990
(Notice of attendance)
Stalker? What's wrong with stalker?

242
00:14:21,990 --> 00:14:22,040
Do you need to write it in English? Do you need me to tell you how to spell it?
(Notice of attendance)
Stalker? What's wrong with stalker?

243
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:24,590
Do you need to write it in English? Do you need me to tell you how to spell it?

244
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:25,950
Officer Kim.

245
00:14:25,950 --> 00:14:27,430
You know?

246
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,390
It looks like you don't know.

247
00:14:29,390 --> 00:14:31,010
You don't even have a girlfriend.

248
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:35,220
What's going on? It's a mess out there.

249
00:14:43,490 --> 00:14:44,970
We're back.

250
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:46,480
I'm scared to death.

251
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,880
Dr. Han.

252
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:53,370
You didn't say you were coming.

253
00:14:55,790 --> 00:14:57,220
I've never seen this cabinet before.

254
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:04,560
It looks so old. Is it an antique?

255
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:05,900
Don't touch it.

256
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:09,090
Hey!

257
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,570
I thought you had taken it away.

258
00:15:10,570 --> 00:15:13,020
Who knew you'd be back so soon, kid?

259
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:17,260
Idiot!

260
00:15:21,030 --> 00:15:22,850
Get away from there! Get away from there!

261
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:25,990
Dr. Han?

262
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:28,310
Yes.

263
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:32,220
I think I told you from the beginning.

264
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,610
Don't touch anything here.

265
00:15:34,610 --> 00:15:38,270
Oh, sorry.

266
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:40,360
Especially that one.

267
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:43,880
Promise me you won't open that door.

268
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,210
Okay.

269
00:15:46,210 --> 00:15:50,790
Don't open it.

270
00:15:50,790 --> 00:15:52,350
Okay, okay.

271
00:15:57,010 --> 00:16:00,020
When I open the door, there will be gifts and presents.

272
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:03,180
It must be a surprise party.

273
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:07,110
Why don't you try a little harder?

274
00:16:07,110 --> 00:16:10,370
Then I'll open it for the sake of sincerity.

275
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:15,010
This is MBS News.

276
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,800
According to the information received by the reporter,

277
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:19,040
Cho, a pharmacist who bullied the inferiors,

278
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:21,230
and Choi, who abused his child.

279
00:16:21,230 --> 00:16:22,470
The Black Bear Gang, a drug trafficking organization that killed a police officer and escaped.

280
00:16:22,470 --> 00:16:25,030
(Exclusive: Frightened Serial Homicide, Victims Frozen to Death)
The Black Bear Gang, a drug trafficking organization that killed a police officer and escaped.

281
00:16:25,200 --> 00:16:27,750
-The Black Bear Gang. -They were also killed in the same way.

282
00:16:27,750 --> 00:16:28,900
-The Black Bear Gang. - The murderer killed the hospitalized...

283
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:33,910
Black Bear Gang? I think I've heard of it somewhere.

284
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:38,200
The Black Bear gang, the largest drug trafficking organization in the country

285
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,690
broke through the police and escaped.

286
00:16:40,690 --> 00:16:45,410
In the process, two police officers were killed and more than 10 were seriously injured.

287
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,830
Obviously, I hit someone.

288
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:55,250
Deity, Deity, you saw me hit someone too, right?

289
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,100
He disappeared unnoticed.

290
00:16:57,100 --> 00:16:59,480
It was as if he moved instantly.

291
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,760
Oh my god, what am I thinking now?

292
00:17:03,460 --> 00:17:05,569
Han Chul! Han Chul, get out of my ear!

293
00:17:05,569 --> 00:17:06,690
Get out of here!

294
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:09,000
It's reported that the police are protecting

295
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,990
the witness who survived the killing of Black Bear Gang.

296
00:17:12,990 --> 00:17:16,150
People are paying high attention to see what the police say afterwards.

297
00:17:16,150 --> 00:17:18,170
MBS News reporter, Kim Sang-yoon.

298
00:17:20,599 --> 00:17:22,849
Where did this leak out from?

299
00:17:22,849 --> 00:17:25,440
I asked the doctor in charge.

300
00:17:25,440 --> 00:17:27,650
He said he was a friend of MBS's Director Hwang.

301
00:17:27,650 --> 00:17:30,320
As a doctor, how dare he sells the information of his patient.

302
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,980
We should report him.

303
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:34,530
Shouldn't we stop the news report first?

304
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:36,020
Stop?

305
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:38,090
How to plug the dam that has already been broken?

306
00:17:38,090 --> 00:17:42,260
Do you want to ask the Dutch Boy to come over and plug it with his fingers like this?

307
00:17:43,370 --> 00:17:44,820
You're crazy!

308
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:48,120
Is it funny? Do you think it's funny?

309
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:50,050
It's all over now.

310
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:51,880
I think we should publish it quickly.

311
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:56,810
Did Ma Sang-jin really identify himself?

312
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,410
Are you sure it's all confirmed?

313
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:02,240
If the identification is wrong and then it's disproved,

314
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:04,330
then we'll all be finished.

315
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,680
We've already confirmed it.

316
00:18:05,680 --> 00:18:07,280
We're ready to arrest him.

317
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:15,740
Okay, we'll do a briefing at dawn tomorrow.

318
00:18:16,890 --> 00:18:17,830
Dismissed.

319
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:28,320
I'll prepare the briefing materials.

320
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,680
Yes, sir.

321
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,090
(Sister)

322
00:18:53,650 --> 00:18:57,300
You can't tell her even if she’s your family.

323
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:59,980
Let's just put up with it for a day.

324
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:01,160
Okay.

325
00:19:18,130 --> 00:19:19,670
Oh, my God.

326
00:19:31,130 --> 00:19:33,230
Mom, help me!

327
00:20:00,710 --> 00:20:02,550
Hey!

328
00:20:02,550 --> 00:20:04,930
It's like an instant movement.

329
00:20:04,930 --> 00:20:06,940
Yeah, it is.

330
00:20:06,940 --> 00:20:11,100
It's a bit strange.

331
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:15,520
He was not here, but suddenly appeared. And then he disappeared.

332
00:20:15,520 --> 00:20:17,020
What am I talking about?

333
00:20:18,410 --> 00:20:22,190
Light it up, light it up, light it up.

334
00:20:36,430 --> 00:20:39,510
We don't know how they were killed. We can't even guess the weapon.

335
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:43,060
Could it be hidden there?

336
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:45,300
Is it possible that he is so rash?

337
00:20:46,130 --> 00:20:47,720
Who am I talking to again?

338
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:48,950
Han Chul...

339
00:21:05,870 --> 00:21:09,500
Promise me you'll never open that door.

340
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:12,560
I'm definitely not doubting you.

341
00:21:12,560 --> 00:21:14,710
I’m willing to be tricked by you.

342
00:21:14,710 --> 00:21:17,220
Because it's a surprise party.

343
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:49,420
A knife or a murder weapon,

344
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,390
well, like military secret...

345
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:00,930
How can there be?

346
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,480
Han Chul is...

347
00:22:11,170 --> 00:22:13,200
How can there be such thing here?

348
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,760
Is it

349
00:22:19,790 --> 00:22:22,000
an underground passage?

350
00:22:22,070 --> 00:22:24,360
What is she doing?

351
00:22:24,360 --> 00:22:27,060
I told you that she likes to read Bluebeard.

352
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:29,080
Maybe she's looking for a corpse.

353
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:33,100
But I didn't expect her to be so serious.

354
00:22:33,100 --> 00:22:34,980
Surprise party. That's great.

355
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:40,520
But does a rehearsal need the closet
and the self-honking drum?

356
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,190
I need to be sure that she's expecting something.

357
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:46,580
If not, then forget it.

358
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:50,510
When fireworks bloom,
and Han Gye-jeol will be surprised and happy to receive a gift.

359
00:22:52,250 --> 00:22:54,780
I'd love to see that.

360
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:58,510
She'll have dozens of birthdays in her life.

361
00:22:58,510 --> 00:23:01,890
But I can only spend one with her.

362
00:23:01,890 --> 00:23:04,110
It must not be treated lightly.

363
00:23:04,110 --> 00:23:05,740
Yes, yes.

364
00:23:05,740 --> 00:23:09,250
We've confirmed that she's doing
everything she's not allowed to do.

365
00:23:09,250 --> 00:23:11,480
And she’s looking forward to
the surprise party.

366
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:13,550
So I'm going out to get ready for the party.

367
00:23:13,550 --> 00:23:15,110
-Stop! -What's wrong?

368
00:23:15,110 --> 00:23:16,410
You're just gonna leave?

369
00:23:16,410 --> 00:23:18,090
Han Gye-jeol opened that door.

370
00:23:18,090 --> 00:23:19,530
You lost the bet, you pay the price.

371
00:23:19,530 --> 00:23:21,200
10,000 won. Give me 10,000 won.

372
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:23,680
Damn it! 10,000...

373
00:23:23,680 --> 00:23:24,880
Oh, this is it.

374
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:34,710
Mirror, mirror, who's the prettiest girl
in the world?

375
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,730
Han Gye-jeol, of course.

376
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:41,290
Me?

377
00:23:45,060 --> 00:23:46,590
So lucky!

378
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,870
Lucky what?

379
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:50,850
I'm lucky she's not my girlfriend.

380
00:23:50,850 --> 00:23:52,140
Do you want to die? Get out!

381
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,940
You're not out yet?

382
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:58,150
Let me handle it.

383
00:24:05,420 --> 00:24:07,130
So cute.

384
00:24:07,130 --> 00:24:07,590
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Station)
So cute.

385
00:24:07,590 --> 00:24:09,450
(Seoul Metropolitan Police Station)

386
00:24:15,980 --> 00:24:18,020
Did you contact Do Jin-woo?

387
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:20,760
Yes, he made it clear that he would come.

388
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:32,960
Great.

389
00:24:32,960 --> 00:24:35,580
What? Labor?

390
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:41,620
The sun is shining, the breeze is blowing,
and the blanket is fluffy.

391
00:24:41,620 --> 00:24:44,110
The moment you lift the blanket,

392
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:46,680
you should see someone you'll
fall in love with at first sight.

393
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:50,730
Right? You know what I mean.

394
00:24:50,730 --> 00:24:52,200
But here's

395
00:24:54,750 --> 00:24:56,380
the reality.

396
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,780
Why are you looking at me like that?

397
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:06,600
But can you do this to him?

398
00:25:06,600 --> 00:25:09,080
Yes, we've known each other since before.

399
00:25:10,980 --> 00:25:13,200
You came here and found out that he’s your friend?

400
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,710
That’s it!

401
00:25:14,710 --> 00:25:16,870
That's why you are called Ok Shin and Gak Shin?

402
00:25:16,870 --> 00:25:18,340
Did you call each other that
when you were kids?

403
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,820
You love each other but can't show it.

404
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,010
And then you cried after you were separated.

405
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:23,570
You really have a rich imagination.

406
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:25,010
If you want someone to cry like that,

407
00:25:26,150 --> 00:25:27,580
at least he should meet this standard, right?

408
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:38,590
My boyfriend.

409
00:25:44,970 --> 00:25:47,500
Why do you dress up so handsome
in the morning?

410
00:25:47,500 --> 00:25:49,490
The police station.

411
00:25:49,490 --> 00:25:50,820
Why go there again?

412
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:53,360
Didn't the matter of the report letter
have been solved?

413
00:25:53,360 --> 00:25:57,540
A shit-colored car was confiscated by the police.

414
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,920
They asked me to go get it back.

415
00:25:58,920 --> 00:26:00,490
Would Korean police

416
00:26:00,490 --> 00:26:03,700
do this to a plutocrat just because of a car?

417
00:26:03,700 --> 00:26:08,380
Yeah, the Korean police are really bold.

418
00:26:08,380 --> 00:26:11,640
Han Chul, what kind of trick is this?

419
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:12,950
Send someone else.

420
00:26:12,950 --> 00:26:14,620
Don't you have a lot of secretaries?

421
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:16,350
They told me to be there in person.

422
00:26:16,350 --> 00:26:17,950
Deity,

423
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:20,190
Deity, how can you be so simple?

424
00:26:20,190 --> 00:26:22,070
Are you showing off that you've never suffered?

425
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:23,190
Me?

426
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:25,540
Am I simple?

427
00:26:25,540 --> 00:26:27,030
I have not suffered?

428
00:26:30,900 --> 00:26:32,570
Think about it.

429
00:26:32,570 --> 00:26:35,680
In a country where a power of attorney
is all that's needed to get a seal certificate,

430
00:26:35,680 --> 00:26:37,180
they call you to go in person for a car.

431
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:39,280
Don't you think it's wired?

432
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:40,570
There must be some kind of conspiracy.

433
00:26:40,570 --> 00:26:42,260
You can't go.

434
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,800
What conspiracy?

435
00:26:43,800 --> 00:26:45,000
Just because the car is expensive.

436
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:47,650
How expensive can it be? 100 million won?

437
00:26:47,650 --> 00:26:48,840
Nope.

438
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:49,980
You see, it's just weird.

439
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,490
It's not that cheap even though it's a junk car.

440
00:26:52,490 --> 00:26:53,780
It's only about 200 million won, right?

441
00:26:53,900 --> 00:26:54,980
The hood alone costs that much.

442
00:26:57,010 --> 00:26:58,660
I think you're up to something, right?

443
00:26:58,660 --> 00:27:00,590
What's the reason for stopping me like that?

444
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:03,560
What?

445
00:27:03,560 --> 00:27:05,160
You don't want to part with me for a second?

446
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,670
Is that why you're doing this?

447
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:11,940
Let's say that's the reason.

448
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:12,940
What?

449
00:27:12,940 --> 00:27:14,420
I mean

450
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:16,330
if you want to go, take me with you.

451
00:27:16,330 --> 00:27:18,270
What do you mean, let's say that's the reason?

452
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,680
Come with me.

453
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,860
You want to go together, right?

454
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:22,790
Yes, yes, let’s go together.

455
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:27,650
What is this?

456
00:27:27,650 --> 00:27:29,590
Next, we'll synchronize the progress

457
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,340
of the investigation of yesterday's media report Frozen to Death Serial Murder Case.

458
00:27:34,340 --> 00:27:36,370
Frozen to Death Serial Murder Case?

459
00:27:36,370 --> 00:27:39,930
Through the testimony of the only witness,

460
00:27:39,930 --> 00:27:43,870
the police identified the suspect.

461
00:27:45,930 --> 00:27:48,280
Considering the suspect is very dangerous,

462
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:53,460
-the police decided to disclose the identity of the suspect immediately.
-What's he staring at?

463
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,980
Let's get out of here.

464
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:58,520
It's too messy here.

465
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:02,760
Suspect Kim Pyung-sun, 53 years old.

466
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,010
He has 5 drug convictions.

467
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:05,520
Kim Pyung-sun?

468
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:08,750
He disappeared a year ago during
the protection and supervision period.

469
00:28:09,940 --> 00:28:14,310
He’s known as Axe in the organization.

470
00:28:19,150 --> 00:28:22,440
What's your name?

471
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,960
Ma Sang-Chen.

472
00:28:28,550 --> 00:28:29,860
Ma Sang-Chen.

473
00:28:36,140 --> 00:28:37,860
Axe…

474
00:28:39,850 --> 00:28:42,240
Axe?

475
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,210
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

476
00:28:50,210 --> 00:28:51,290
I'm really sorry.

477
00:28:58,540 --> 00:29:01,650
Is that really why you asked him to come?

478
00:29:01,650 --> 00:29:03,790
Is it really about the car?

479
00:29:03,790 --> 00:29:05,720
Because it is evidence,

480
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,970
it can only be returned in person.

481
00:29:08,970 --> 00:29:11,190
We should have caught the killer earlier.

482
00:29:11,190 --> 00:29:14,290
I'm sorry for the trouble you've gone through.

483
00:29:17,740 --> 00:29:20,520
I was the one who had the car impounded.

484
00:29:20,520 --> 00:29:24,490
Why did he say you’ve suffered?

485
00:29:32,050 --> 00:29:36,210
Once again, I didn't believe this person.

486
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:38,220
They are crazy.

487
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:40,570
Who?

488
00:29:43,690 --> 00:29:45,110
The police.

489
00:29:45,110 --> 00:29:46,640
Why?

490
00:29:47,970 --> 00:29:50,500
How can they handle things like this?

491
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,160
They returned the car so late
because they couldn't catch the killer.

492
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:55,580
The murderer?

493
00:29:55,580 --> 00:29:58,070
Do you really think that was killing?

494
00:29:58,070 --> 00:29:59,950
He killed someone.

495
00:29:59,950 --> 00:30:02,190
And it wasn't just one or two people.

496
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:03,410
Of course it's killing.

497
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:09,000
Why do you see only those
who are condemned to death?

498
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,410
Can't you see the people who were saved by it?

499
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:14,740
Yoona, who was abused, longed to be loved.

500
00:30:14,740 --> 00:30:18,220
The trampled college girl prayed that
her mother would stop crying.

501
00:30:18,220 --> 00:30:20,640
The victims want only one thing,

502
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,560
which is to live as human beings,

503
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:24,620
even if it's just for one day.

504
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,050
Because of the deaths of Choe Gwang-mo and Jo Bong-pil,

505
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:29,010
people like Yoona and the college girl have a chance to live.

506
00:30:29,010 --> 00:30:30,430
Even if that's the case, is it still killing?

507
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,520
I think

508
00:30:34,520 --> 00:30:38,250
there is no such thing as a good killing
or a bad killing.

509
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:40,990
When humans give meaning to killing,

510
00:30:40,990 --> 00:30:42,520
it means tolerance and approval of killing.

511
00:30:42,520 --> 00:30:44,840
Then they will kill at will

512
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:46,590
and according to their own standards.

513
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:49,010
I don't want to live in that kind of hell

514
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,820
Killing is cruel.

515
00:30:50,820 --> 00:30:52,740
Murderers are unforgivable.

516
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:54,670
That's the only truth I believe in.

517
00:30:57,940 --> 00:31:00,950
Cruel and unforgivable?

518
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,940
I also understand the anger

519
00:31:03,940 --> 00:31:05,150
every time I see those bastards.

520
00:31:05,150 --> 00:31:07,780
I sometimes want to kill those bad guys.

521
00:31:07,780 --> 00:31:11,470
But don't say that in front of others.

522
00:31:11,470 --> 00:31:13,490
Others will misunderstand.

523
00:31:15,470 --> 00:31:16,790
Others? Who?

524
00:31:16,790 --> 00:31:18,320
Officer Han Chul?

525
00:31:19,720 --> 00:31:21,390
What did he misunderstand?

526
00:31:21,390 --> 00:31:23,230
That I'm a murderer?

527
00:31:25,150 --> 00:31:26,490
How did you...

528
00:31:26,490 --> 00:31:28,910
Your brother has been investigating the killer.

529
00:31:28,910 --> 00:31:30,820
And every time you heard something like that,

530
00:31:30,820 --> 00:31:32,120
you tried to hide me.

531
00:31:32,120 --> 00:31:36,270
And your brother’s colleague comforted you.

532
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:37,740
It's so obvious. If I couldn’t find it out,

533
00:31:37,740 --> 00:31:38,770
wouldn't I have lived in vain?

534
00:31:40,190 --> 00:31:42,540
Sorry, I didn't tell you about my brother.

535
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:47,540
It's because he keeps saying things
that don't make sense.

536
00:31:47,540 --> 00:31:49,500
Superpowers and military secrets.

537
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:51,260
How can I tell you such nonsense?

538
00:31:53,860 --> 00:31:56,390
A knife or a murder weapon, and what else?

539
00:31:56,390 --> 00:31:58,460
Well, like military secret...

540
00:32:00,150 --> 00:32:02,750
You...

541
00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:05,860
Is that why you went through the closet?

542
00:32:05,860 --> 00:32:06,760
Because you suspected me?

543
00:32:06,760 --> 00:32:08,300
To find evidence?

544
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:16,490
What is the end of your suspicion?

545
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:19,260
From suspicion to certainty,
it will eventually turn into betrayal, right?

546
00:32:19,260 --> 00:32:20,820
If you do find the weapon

547
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:22,220
the moment you think I'm a murderer,

548
00:32:22,220 --> 00:32:24,050
you'll leave me immediately, right?

549
00:32:24,050 --> 00:32:27,120
Don't speculate on my thoughts.

550
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:29,580
Behind your suspicions,

551
00:32:31,230 --> 00:32:33,850
did you really not think of abandoning me?

552
00:32:34,370 --> 00:32:35,600
Not even once?

553
00:32:49,410 --> 00:32:51,030
Deity.

554
00:32:52,190 --> 00:32:53,400
Deity,

555
00:32:55,210 --> 00:32:57,970
listen to me.

556
00:32:59,050 --> 00:33:01,410
Surprise!

557
00:33:01,410 --> 00:33:07,370
Happy birthday to you!

558
00:33:07,370 --> 00:33:09,990
Dear...

559
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,350
What's going on?

560
00:33:13,350 --> 00:33:14,230
I know, I know.

561
00:33:14,230 --> 00:33:15,040
Not this style, right?

562
00:33:15,040 --> 00:33:16,070
I know.

563
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:20,130
Hey, it's your birthday.

564
00:33:20,130 --> 00:33:22,080
What a happy occasion!

565
00:33:22,740 --> 00:33:24,230
Go to hell!

566
00:33:25,970 --> 00:33:30,660
You’re so bad at reading people's minds,
why are you still alive?

567
00:34:11,650 --> 00:34:14,770
(Deity)

568
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:28,679
The subscriber you dialed can not
be connected for the moment,

569
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,909
you will be transferred to
the voice message later.

570
00:34:34,909 --> 00:34:36,650
Sorry.
(Sorry. (typo in text message))

571
00:34:41,469 --> 00:34:45,560
How could I have such a ridiculous idea?
(How could I have such a ridiculous idea? (Typo in text message))

572
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,030
I should have trusted you.
(I should have trusted you. (Typo in text message))

573
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:06,940
(Can you give me a chance? (Typo in text message))
Can you give me a chance?

574
00:35:06,940 --> 00:35:09,220
Trying to write the text well,
but my hands don't work.
(Can you give me a chance? (Typo in text message))

575
00:35:09,220 --> 00:35:11,550
Trying to write the text well,
but my hands don't work.

576
00:35:13,650 --> 00:35:18,250
I want to be good,
but my heart is always against me.

577
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:25,570
Looking back, my love is very difficult.

578
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:29,970
I can delete the mistakes written by hand,

579
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:37,060
can I delete the mistakes in my heart?

580
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,900
It's late.

581
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:48,540
She is not coming today?

582
00:35:48,540 --> 00:35:50,620
Whatever.

583
00:35:51,290 --> 00:35:53,930
Aren't you planning to wear it tomorrow?

584
00:35:53,930 --> 00:35:55,770
It's okay if you don't wear it?

585
00:35:55,770 --> 00:35:57,670
Wear what?

586
00:35:57,670 --> 00:36:00,050
Margiela's limited edition shirt.

587
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:03,680
Ah!

588
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:08,410
Then what are you waiting for?

589
00:36:08,410 --> 00:36:11,500
Han Gye-jeol!

590
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:20,380
Did she go in?

591
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,620
So you're waiting for Han Gye-jeol.

592
00:36:22,620 --> 00:36:25,310
She's already back…

593
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:28,570
Have I been too nice to you lately?

594
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:31,810
So, also be nice to her.

595
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:40,540
There’s not much time left. Just forgive her.

596
00:36:40,540 --> 00:36:44,590
She’s a mortal. She’ll be suspicious
and she’ll misunderstand.

597
00:36:46,490 --> 00:36:50,200
More or less, she’ll be suspicious
and will misunderstand.

598
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:55,240
But this is not a misunderstanding.

599
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:05,000
I'm a god, and I do justice, that's the truth.

600
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:11,660
I'm a monster and I kill people.

601
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:16,290
To Han Gye-jeol, that's also true.

602
00:37:16,290 --> 00:37:23,860
Yes, a god that is hard to understand.

603
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:34,060
I've hated myself, but I've never
been unsure of myself.

604
00:37:35,510 --> 00:37:38,790
I never cared

605
00:37:38,790 --> 00:37:41,170
what other people thought of me.

606
00:37:41,170 --> 00:37:45,920
Then the more I like them,
the more uneasy I feel.

607
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:51,760
If this person gets to know the real me,

608
00:37:51,760 --> 00:37:56,050
will he be disappointed in me and run away?

609
00:37:56,050 --> 00:38:00,490
Will he be disappointed in me and run away?

610
00:38:00,870 --> 00:38:03,700
I thought that was a stupid idea.

611
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:06,260
But I have become like that now.

612
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,540
Because I'm being so unfamiliar,

613
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:12,550
I'm angry at myself, not her.

614
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:29,200
(Who is Kim Pyung-sun, the suspect in the serial frozen death murder case?)

615
00:38:35,590 --> 00:38:38,250
I should have put Do Jin-woo in jail.

616
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,320
Hey!

617
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,630
If things go well, we'll be able to
get the sales license.

618
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,690
Really? It seems like the serial killer
has a big impact.

619
00:38:51,690 --> 00:38:55,290
There seems to be less attention on this side.

620
00:38:55,290 --> 00:38:58,170
Yeah, it's something I've never heard of.

621
00:38:58,170 --> 00:39:01,600
When things like movies happen,
no one cares about new drugs.

622
00:39:03,370 --> 00:39:07,190
MBS's interview with cartilage patients

623
00:39:07,190 --> 00:39:09,620
seems to have been approved by the superiors.

624
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:12,230
Right? As long as Pilseong doesn't release the new drug,

625
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:15,020
they will suffer one more day.
What else can they do?

626
00:39:15,020 --> 00:39:18,050
This is your work, right?

627
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:20,510
How can it be a work? It's a fact.

628
00:39:21,630 --> 00:39:24,590
Anyway, try to finish it before the end of the month.

629
00:39:24,590 --> 00:39:25,870
I'll return the favor.

630
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:30,010
It's just the right time.
Timing is just a split second.

631
00:39:30,010 --> 00:39:32,700
Don't make any more trouble, my friend.

632
00:39:34,330 --> 00:39:36,150
-You can't go in there.
-Let go!

633
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:38,540
I'll call you back.

634
00:39:38,540 --> 00:39:40,690
All right, get out.

635
00:39:45,480 --> 00:39:46,110
(New drug marketing plan)

636
00:39:46,110 --> 00:39:48,710
Why do I have to promote the new drug?

637
00:39:48,710 --> 00:39:51,590
I just accepted the sponsorship.
I didn't agree to do this.

638
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:55,100
Your worn cartilage has recovered
from taking this medicine.

639
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:58,120
Thanks to this, you can continue
your career as a player.

640
00:39:58,120 --> 00:40:00,310
Isn't that the kind of promotion
you're supposed to do?

641
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,430
How could you...

642
00:40:03,430 --> 00:40:05,800
How could I not know about

643
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,540
your participation in our clinical trials for the new drug?

644
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:17,510
Shouldn't the identity of the subject
be kept secret as a matter of principle?

645
00:40:19,450 --> 00:40:21,800
I don't like principles. I like to break rules.

646
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:27,970
You have a lot to do when the new drug
is launched.

647
00:40:27,970 --> 00:40:31,230
Go to the publicity team and do what they want.

00:41:00,530 --> 00:41:04,420
Sorry to interrupt, I have something
important to do right now.

651
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,860
But my phone screen suddenly broke,
so I can't use it.

652
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:09,240
Can I borrow your phone?

653
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,540
Yes, you can use it.

654
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:12,520
Thank you.

655
00:41:30,250 --> 00:41:32,230
Deity, good morning.

656
00:41:34,370 --> 00:41:35,770
He can’t be good.

657
00:41:39,380 --> 00:41:42,610
Deity, sorry.

658
00:41:42,610 --> 00:41:44,910
No highlights, highlights.

659
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:49,240
Deity, I love you.

660
00:41:51,010 --> 00:41:53,820
Well, this will violate the contract.

661
00:41:59,120 --> 00:42:00,870
Where is Deity?

662
00:42:00,870 --> 00:42:02,460
He's gone to the company.

663
00:42:02,460 --> 00:42:05,340
Company? Why? He has nothing to do.

664
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,920
Who knows why he's going there
early in the morning?

665
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:09,320
Don't know what kind of trouble
he's going to make.

666
00:42:09,320 --> 00:42:11,220
Sit down and eat something too.

667
00:42:11,220 --> 00:42:12,490
Okay, just a moment.

668
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:26,880
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected for the moment,
you will be transferred to the voice message later.

669
00:42:29,850 --> 00:42:33,120
(Yoo's Teppan Chicken)

670
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,780
Dr. Han,

671
00:42:50,780 --> 00:42:52,940
looks like you're lonely.

672
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:54,460
What?

673
00:42:54,460 --> 00:42:58,140
Isn't it? If you are lonely,
your heart will become empty,

674
00:42:58,140 --> 00:43:01,050
and if your heart becomes empty,
you will want to eat good food.

675
00:43:02,750 --> 00:43:03,740
What's wrong?

676
00:43:03,740 --> 00:43:05,760
Do their families bully you?

677
00:43:07,020 --> 00:43:08,970
Who is it? Lead the way for me.

678
00:43:08,970 --> 00:43:12,330
No, no, they're really nice to me.

679
00:43:12,330 --> 00:43:15,100
I just want to eat this Tepppan chicken.

680
00:43:15,100 --> 00:43:17,410
My mom used to make it for me.

681
00:43:17,410 --> 00:43:20,630
Your mother is a very good cook.

682
00:43:20,630 --> 00:43:22,210
that she can make it taste like this.

683
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:26,330
Look at this cheese. It's drawbench.

684
00:43:27,620 --> 00:43:30,710
It's delicious, but not to this extent.

685
00:43:38,390 --> 00:43:42,180
This fish cake soup is really delicious.

686
00:43:43,030 --> 00:43:44,830
Why can't we make it at home?

687
00:43:46,330 --> 00:43:47,400
Why can't we make it?

688
00:43:47,400 --> 00:43:50,060
Let me go buy some fish cakes tomorrow
and cook it for you.

689
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:53,670
Forget it, Gyeong-seung,
what's wrong with the fish cake?

690
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,950
You really are...

691
00:43:54,950 --> 00:43:56,650
What's wrong with my cooking?

692
00:43:56,650 --> 00:43:58,460
To be honest,

693
00:43:58,460 --> 00:44:02,020
I was fascinated by O Gyeong-seung's appearance,
but not her cooking.

694
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:08,860
I can only forgive him by smiling.

695
00:44:08,860 --> 00:44:13,010
You two really have a good relationship

696
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:14,500
Have you never had a fight?

697
00:44:14,500 --> 00:44:15,950
How can we not fight?

698
00:44:15,950 --> 00:44:20,010
I am stubborn. So O Gyeong-seung is quite hard.

699
00:44:22,210 --> 00:44:28,340
Then if you fight, how to make up?

700
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:31,860
What happened?

701
00:44:31,860 --> 00:44:33,890
Did you have a fight with Johns?

702
00:44:48,070 --> 00:44:52,000
I want to apologize to him,
but he always avoids me.

703
00:44:53,510 --> 00:44:56,640
How can the other party apologize
to you to make you feel happy?

704
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:00,770
Well, it's time to untie the bell, of course.

705
00:45:00,770 --> 00:45:01,480
What?

706
00:45:01,480 --> 00:45:04,930
When she hated me for beating
my father-in-law with a stick,

707
00:45:04,930 --> 00:45:08,700
I was really happy that she’d
say sorry and buy me a drink.

708
00:45:10,400 --> 00:45:13,350
You’re starting to speak ill of
my family again.

709
00:45:17,900 --> 00:45:20,090
You find the fix! Come on!

710
00:45:20,090 --> 00:45:21,510
(Note: "Untie the bell" and "Cancel the account" are homophones)
I do know how to cancel the bank
account and the passbook account.

711
00:45:21,510 --> 00:45:23,220
But I’ve never heard of that kind of
account cancellation.
(Note: "Untie the bell" and "Cancel the account" are homophones)

712
00:45:25,860 --> 00:45:28,320
Whoever causes trouble should
solve it, you fool.

713
00:45:28,320 --> 00:45:32,070
Hey, how can you call me a fool?
I’m your brother.

714
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:35,660
No, we’re both learned people.
Let’s have a good talk.

715
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:37,860
When your words sound normal,
then we can talk it over.

716
00:45:37,860 --> 00:45:40,170
You said something like teleportation

717
00:45:40,170 --> 00:45:42,950
and military secrets. What’s the matter?

718
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:44,240
I’m wrong, sis.

719
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,270
Tell me what you did wrong
and I’ll beat you once when you name one.

720
00:45:50,270 --> 00:45:52,210
Like you said, I feel uneasy,

721
00:45:52,210 --> 00:45:54,400
or too eager to catch someone important.

722
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:56,860
Whatever it is, I did lose my mind
for a moment.

723
00:45:56,860 --> 00:46:00,320
I’m sorry that I upset you
and brother-in-law.

724
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,600
What? Brother-in-law?

725
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:12,310
You used to say that he’s a bastard.

726
00:46:12,310 --> 00:46:14,170
Have a conscience, okay?

727
00:46:15,380 --> 00:46:19,140
I have no conscience, but I’m sensitive.

728
00:46:19,140 --> 00:46:20,270
What do I need to do next?

729
00:46:20,270 --> 00:46:23,060
How about sending a handwritten
letter to my brother-in-law as an apology?

730
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,680
Are you a soldier of the national army?
Why handwritten letter?

731
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,720
First, you call him yourself and ask him out.

732
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:30,990
Then come with me to find him
and apologize.

733
00:46:30,990 --> 00:46:34,180
Get down on your knees and admit your crime.

734
00:46:34,180 --> 00:46:36,510
("Negative" and "Asbestos" are homophones)
What crime did I commit?

735
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:38,330
I see. It’s a carcinogen.
("Negative" and "Asbestos" are homophones)

736
00:46:38,330 --> 00:46:41,870
That’s asbestos.
("Negative" and "Asbestos" are homophones)

737
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,480
Anyway, you don’t need to know that.

738
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:47,620
Just call.

739
00:46:49,140 --> 00:46:51,350
Will brother-in-law answer my call?

740
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,990
You have to call until he answers it.

741
00:46:52,990 --> 00:46:54,880
You’ve gone too far.
Can’t you show some sincerity?

742
00:47:00,020 --> 00:47:01,970
But you don’t have to worry too much.

743
00:47:01,970 --> 00:47:06,500
Our Deity is especially manly and broad-minded.

744
00:47:06,500 --> 00:47:07,570
He’ll forgive you soon.

745
00:47:09,340 --> 00:47:12,750
Our Deity? It’s ridiculous that
you call him like this.

746
00:47:12,750 --> 00:47:15,410
That’s my business. No matter I call
him Deity or stone, it’s none of your business.

747
00:47:17,770 --> 00:47:21,160
Just keep calling him.

748
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,880
I’ll keep an eye on you.

749
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,480
I see.

750
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:27,180
I’ll really be watching you.
You have to call.

751
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,360
Must call!

752
00:47:36,600 --> 00:47:38,810
Brother-in-law, bro...

753
00:47:41,790 --> 00:47:42,840
Damn it!

754
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:59,660
(Dr. Tai)

755
00:48:02,060 --> 00:48:04,000
If you go to find her because you miss her,

756
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,390
then you really are a stalker, you maniac.

757
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,690
Customer, this color suits you, too.

758
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,410
No, it’s okay.

759
00:48:23,410 --> 00:48:25,540
You look so beautiful with a smile
around your eyes.

760
00:48:25,540 --> 00:48:28,240
You’re as cute as a puppy. So cute.

761
00:48:34,730 --> 00:48:37,110
Ah, am I crazy?

762
00:48:43,440 --> 00:48:44,700
I’m sorry.

763
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:48,000
For what?

764
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:49,490
For burning the meat?

765
00:48:49,490 --> 00:48:51,070
Because I’ve made you suffer.

766
00:48:51,070 --> 00:48:54,860
You might have been scared and angry, right?

767
00:48:55,900 --> 00:48:58,760
Can you tell me the reason?

768
00:48:58,760 --> 00:49:00,880
Why didn’t you keep my appointment?

769
00:49:06,320 --> 00:49:08,840
Because there is a big case in Seoul.

770
00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,700
Missed the appointment because of work?

771
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:27,970
Because the case is connected to my sister.

772
00:49:27,970 --> 00:49:29,440
To stop her.

773
00:49:40,300 --> 00:49:41,770
Missed the appointment because of your sister?

774
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,300
Because she’s the only family I have.

775
00:49:46,300 --> 00:49:50,350
Then people who have no family
must be sad to death.

776
00:49:50,350 --> 00:49:53,070
Don’t you have a family?

777
00:49:55,150 --> 00:49:57,490
I mean, no family in Korea.

778
00:49:57,490 --> 00:49:59,170
What’s wrong?

779
00:49:59,170 --> 00:50:01,000
Is it your first time to meet
someone without a family?

780
00:50:03,790 --> 00:50:06,060
Is that why you came to Seoul?
To start a family?

781
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:12,520
So when you feel suitable after a blind date,
you get married and become a family?

782
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:13,850
Is there anything special about family?

783
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:18,700
Too busy because of the blind date.

784
00:50:26,640 --> 00:50:28,450
What are you doing?

785
00:50:28,450 --> 00:50:29,730
Because it smells.

786
00:50:29,730 --> 00:50:31,940
The smell has to be offset by the smell.

787
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:32,920
What?

788
00:50:32,920 --> 00:50:36,210
I don’t know who you met.
The perfume is so strong.

789
00:50:36,210 --> 00:50:38,820
What’s the matter? Don’ you like the perfume?

790
00:50:38,820 --> 00:50:40,600
I think it smells good.

791
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,500
I really hate it.

792
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:51,910
Should I use alcohol to keep him?

793
00:51:09,870 --> 00:51:13,490
By the way, you can really drink.

794
00:51:13,490 --> 00:51:16,170
You look quite fine.

795
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:19,410
How can there be such a rigid man?

796
00:51:19,410 --> 00:51:23,160
You mean alcohol? I don’t drink at work.

797
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:25,530
Work?

798
00:51:25,530 --> 00:51:31,490
If I get drunk, who will protect the earth?

799
00:51:35,020 --> 00:51:36,810
Who will protect the earth?

800
00:51:41,550 --> 00:51:42,870
Pay attention to the car.

801
00:51:50,580 --> 00:51:52,690
Can you continue to catch me like this?

802
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:55,660
What?

803
00:51:57,390 --> 00:51:59,420
I mean, don’t hold the guys who wear perfume.

804
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,590
Can’t you hold me?

805
00:52:16,860 --> 00:52:17,800
Or...

806
00:52:20,850 --> 00:52:23,360
I don’t deserve you at this level.

807
00:53:43,410 --> 00:53:45,530
-Bulhwa! Bulhwa! Bulhwa!
-Bulhwa! Bulhwa! Bulhwa!

808
00:53:45,530 --> 00:53:49,050
What are they doing? Crazy?

809
00:53:49,050 --> 00:53:52,320

Hello, brother-in-law.

What kind of trick are you playing?

817
00:54:13,180 --> 00:54:14,190
I don’t play any trick.

818
00:54:14,190 --> 00:54:17,600
You’ve gone too far with
your unique brother-in-law.

819
00:54:17,600 --> 00:54:20,080
Is it because I’m your unique brother-in-law
that you tortured me like that?

820
00:54:20,080 --> 00:54:21,980
I know I’m wrong.

821
00:54:21,980 --> 00:54:23,560
I want to show my sincerity.

822
00:54:23,560 --> 00:54:24,720
But I don’t know how to say it.

823
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:26,770
So I’m thinking about admit
my mistake and apologize.

824
00:54:26,770 --> 00:54:28,550
Admit your mistake and apologize?

825
00:54:28,550 --> 00:54:29,690
How about I buy you a good meal?

826
00:54:29,690 --> 00:54:31,110
I know a very good restaurant.

827
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:33,140
I’ll make a reservation at 7 p.m.
and then I’ll call you back.

But why can I only go to Pilseong Hospital?

I can’t even go to another hospital.

Is that reasonable?

839

As far as I know, it’s because there
are many secrets about your body...

I can’t argue. I have to do what I’m told.

I’m asking you to get out!

The time you decided whether to
join PGA in America?

898
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:10,670
You lived too well to care for a
person like me. So you dumped me?

899
00:59:10,670 --> 00:59:12,780
But why did you accept the clinical trial?

900
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:15,580
Did I dump you because I lived too well?

901
00:59:15,580 --> 00:59:18,950
My cartilage was worn and knees were crushed.

902

I knew if I don’t play golf,
I’m no different from a hooligan.

903
00:59:23,030 --> 00:59:24,990
I did that because I thought
it was too embarrassing.

I’ve never promised that.

I heard that Pilseong produced a
new drug to treat cartilage.

908
00:59:37,390 --> 00:59:39,180
So I thought... Anyway, my body
was rather terrible.

909
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:40,440
Why not try that?

910
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:43,530
So that list recorded people
who participated in the clinical trial?

911

It could be like that.

But you...

913
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:50,390
When did you know Jang Mi-sun
was on that list?

914
00:59:51,290 --> 00:59:54,110
Of course he knew that when
you filed the indictment.

915
00:59:54,890 --> 00:59:56,240
Did you really know it at that time?

916
00:59:58,850 --> 01:00:01,100
You knew it when Bak Chung-seong
was alive, right?

917
01:00:03,530 --> 01:00:04,390
Yes.

918
01:00:06,130 --> 01:00:07,790
I am just wondering

919
01:00:07,790 --> 01:00:08,830
why mention the list...

920
01:00:08,830 --> 01:00:11,310
How can you believe that kind of nonsense?

921
01:00:11,310 --> 01:00:12,930
How can you believe it and hide it?

922
01:00:12,930 --> 01:00:14,470
What if it’s insurance fraud?

923
01:00:14,470 --> 01:00:17,920
Maybe your image will be
completely ruined at once.

924
01:00:17,920 --> 01:00:20,510
Are you willing to bear all this only
because you believe the brother you know?

925
01:00:21,900 --> 01:00:24,160
Man is not such a great being.

926
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:27,350
You... Is it true?

927
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:31,380
I saw Jang Mi-sun’s name in my brother’s list.

928
01:00:32,370 --> 01:00:35,220
Because I’ve actually seen her,

929
01:00:35,220 --> 01:00:37,790
I don’t think Brother Chung-jeong
would tell a lie.

930
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:40,470
But why have you been hiding it until now?

931
01:00:43,070 --> 01:00:44,800
Because he has to tell his secret.

932
01:00:46,260 --> 01:00:48,980
He’s afraid that people will know
he participated in the clinical trial.

933
01:00:49,390 --> 01:00:52,600
He’s not sure, and his name isn’t in the list.

01:01:03,470 --> 01:01:08,830
So... Does Kim Pil-soo know about
your injection of the new medicine?

937
01:01:10,850 --> 01:01:13,010
I’ve been threatened because of this.

938
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:15,350
Because I don’t want to be
threatened all the time.

939
01:01:18,030 --> 01:01:19,250
So you came to see me?

940
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,210

941
01:01:26,150 --> 01:01:26,730
Yes.

942
01:01:28,110 --> 01:01:29,830
Although I’m not qualified to say this...

943
01:01:31,950 --> 01:01:33,130
Please help me.

944
01:01:39,340 --> 01:01:41,380
Thanks for telling me about the list.

945
01:01:41,950 --> 01:01:43,640
What should I do?

946
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:45,580
I won’t cooperate with someone
I can’t trust.

947
01:01:47,860 --> 01:01:50,060
Betrayal is a habit.

948
01:01:50,060 --> 01:01:52,380
He who betrays once will betray again.

949
01:02:06,350 --> 01:02:08,580
I know I-deun has made a lot of mistakes.

950
01:02:08,580 --> 01:02:10,640
But can’t you give him another chance?

951
01:02:11,110 --> 01:02:13,690
You can give him a chance to
reflect and seek forgiveness.

952
01:02:15,050 --> 01:02:16,790
You said betrayal is a habit,

953
01:02:16,790 --> 01:02:20,010
and he who betrays once will betray again.
You turned around after making such a conclusion.

954
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:22,210
When to apologize?

955
01:02:22,210 --> 01:02:25,590
When to be forgiven?

956
01:02:25,590 --> 01:02:27,080
When will it be settled?

957
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:30,610
Don’t mention it anymore.

958
01:02:34,770 --> 01:02:35,530
I’m sorry.

959
01:02:41,110 --> 01:02:45,130
I’m really sad that I didn’t apologize properly.

960
01:02:47,830 --> 01:02:49,580
Forget it.

961
01:02:49,580 --> 01:02:51,230
It’s not your fault.

962
01:02:51,890 --> 01:02:53,320
And it’s not something worth
apologizing for.

963
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:56,450
Thank you.

964
01:03:02,370 --> 01:03:03,150
However,

965
01:03:05,020 --> 01:03:09,170
I still have many chances to
apologize to you, but I-deun doesn’t.

966
01:03:10,190 --> 01:03:12,290
His heart must be suffering, too.

967
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:16,160
It’s been bugging me since just now.

968
01:03:16,870 --> 01:03:18,970
Why keep calling him I-deun?
When did you start doing that?

969
01:03:19,370 --> 01:03:21,260
You’ve heard it just now.

970
01:03:21,260 --> 01:03:23,090
About five years ago.

971
01:03:24,230 --> 01:03:26,560
No, I didn’t call him I-deun at that time.

972
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,650
I might call him darling.

973
01:03:28,650 --> 01:03:30,180
Darling?

974
01:03:31,240 --> 01:03:33,820
When I leave, you’ll be intimate
with him, right?

975
01:03:33,990 --> 01:03:35,000
No way.

976
01:03:35,000 --> 01:03:37,320
So that’s why you don’t want to
cooperate with I-deun?

977
01:03:37,320 --> 01:03:39,480
Because you’re jealous of us being intimate.

978
01:03:39,480 --> 01:03:41,370
Jealous?

979
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:42,620
Ah.

980
01:03:43,940 --> 01:03:47,800
How can people understand God’s kindness?
They’re really insignificant.

981
01:03:48,440 --> 01:03:50,120
What kindness?

982
01:03:50,120 --> 01:03:52,870
Kim Pil-soo can do everything
to protect the new drug.

983
01:03:52,870 --> 01:03:54,610
He even betrayed his family.

984
01:03:54,610 --> 01:03:56,230
Can he just watch

985
01:03:56,230 --> 01:03:58,100
Jeong I-deun come to Bulhwa
and do nothing?

986
01:03:58,100 --> 01:03:59,830
As the saying goes, it’s dark under the lamp.

987
01:03:59,830 --> 01:04:01,930
It’s safer for him to stay with
Kim Pil-soo now.

988
01:04:02,790 --> 01:04:05,620
Since he’s useful, they won’t hurt him.

989
01:04:06,350 --> 01:04:09,200
After bringing down Kim Pil-soo,
I Eung-chul will protect him.

990
01:04:15,220 --> 01:04:15,780
What’s wrong?

991
01:04:17,190 --> 01:04:18,440
I feel proud.

992
01:04:19,490 --> 01:04:20,290
Why?

993
01:04:20,290 --> 01:04:25,040
You’re such a great man.
I feel a little unworthy of you.

994
01:04:25,040 --> 01:04:26,840
But you still love me.

995
01:04:30,110 --> 01:04:30,670
Let’s go.

996
01:04:31,630 --> 01:04:32,330
Where?

997
01:04:32,330 --> 01:04:34,760
To the restaurant your brother has reserved.

998
01:04:34,760 --> 01:04:36,810
I want to see how good it is.

999
01:04:38,000 --> 01:04:38,990
Well.

1000
01:04:38,990 --> 01:04:42,590
That... I have something to deal with.

1001
01:04:43,330 --> 01:04:45,590
Anyway, there’s still some time.
I’ll see you there later.

1002
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:46,950
I’ll take my brother there.

1003
01:04:46,950 --> 01:04:48,300
Let’s go together.

1004
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,220
No, no. There... Let’s meet there.

1005
01:04:50,220 --> 01:04:51,930
Later... See you later.

1006
01:04:51,930 --> 01:04:54,650
-No, let’s go together... Go together.
-Goodbye.

1007
01:04:55,270 --> 01:04:56,790
Why do you speak like that?

1008
01:04:57,420 --> 01:04:59,130
Why does she only talk to herself?

1009
01:04:59,130 --> 01:05:00,350
Is this really genetic?

1010
01:05:00,350 --> 01:05:02,790
Thanks for telling me about the list.

1011
01:05:03,540 --> 01:05:04,670
What should I do?

1012
01:05:04,670 --> 01:05:06,730
I won’t cooperate with someone
I can’t trust.

1013
01:05:07,720 --> 01:05:09,390
Betrayal is a habit.

1014
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:11,990
He who betrays once will betray again.

1015
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:16,050
Just like you said. Thank God I spied on I-deun.

1016
01:05:16,210 --> 01:05:17,180
Thanks.

1017
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,180
Do we...

1018
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:26,610
kill... Jeong I-deun?

1019
01:05:26,610 --> 01:05:28,900
Even if we get rid of him,
what problems can we solve?

1020
01:05:30,180 --> 01:05:31,820
Do Jin-woo is still alive.

1021
01:05:34,280 --> 01:05:36,130
Go catch Han Gye-jeol.

1022
01:05:36,980 --> 01:05:38,600
That guy won’t stand by.

1023
01:05:38,600 --> 01:05:39,940
What else could he do?

1024
01:05:40,620 --> 01:05:42,820
He is so obedient to Han Gye-jeol’s words.

1025
01:05:42,820 --> 01:05:45,490
Will Han Gye-jeol listen to us?

1026
01:05:46,220 --> 01:05:49,190
Whether to bribe her or kill her families.

1027
01:05:50,230 --> 01:05:51,720
As long as she can obey us.

1028
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,200
(Seoul Myeongin University Hospital)

1029
01:06:17,530 --> 01:06:18,280
Oh my god.

1030
01:06:22,050 --> 01:06:22,970
I’m sorry.

1031
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:24,700
I’m sorry.

1032
01:06:24,700 --> 01:06:25,710
No, that’s alright.

1033
01:06:26,360 --> 01:06:27,720
I walked in a hurry.

1034
01:06:28,630 --> 01:06:29,310
I’m sorry.

1035
01:06:33,740 --> 01:06:35,380
(Choi Tae-hyung, Department of Internal Medicine, Myeongin University Hospital)

1036
01:06:37,890 --> 01:06:38,570
Give it to me.

1037
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,540
I’m sorry.

1038
01:06:41,540 --> 01:06:42,480
No, it’s okay.

1039
01:06:46,540 --> 01:06:47,780
Thank you for this period of time.

1040
01:06:47,780 --> 01:06:49,460
You’ve worked hard, too.

1041
01:06:53,350 --> 01:06:53,900
Hey.

1042
01:06:53,900 --> 01:06:54,600
What’s up?

1043
01:06:54,600 --> 01:06:57,100
-Is it all signed?
-Yes, it’s all confirmed.

1044
01:06:58,970 --> 01:07:01,100
I don’t have to come here anymore, right?

1045
01:07:02,070 --> 01:07:02,990
Of course.

1046
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:06,130
If it comes out that I was the
responsible doctor of Ma Sang-jin, you..

1047
01:07:07,090 --> 01:07:08,020
You’re dead.

1048
01:07:09,010 --> 01:07:10,260
I said don’t worry.

1049
01:07:12,470 --> 01:07:13,330
Let’s go.

1050
01:07:13,330 --> 01:07:15,840
I have to find Ma Sang-jin and
get back some materials.

1051
01:07:15,840 --> 01:07:17,980
I’ll get the car out of the parking lot.

1052
01:07:17,980 --> 01:07:18,990
Let’s meet at the gate.

1053
01:07:19,220 --> 01:07:21,060
(As your health care doctor, I will always be by your side.)

1054
01:07:38,280 --> 01:07:39,130
Oh my god.

1055
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:41,840
My poor memory.

1056
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,510
I left my wallet there.

1057
01:08:07,050 --> 01:08:09,390
You applied for the installation of
anti-theft equipment, right?

1058
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,310
My body can’t move.

1059
01:08:21,460 --> 01:08:22,399
Why?

1060
01:08:30,450 --> 01:08:31,000
Oh my god.

1061
01:08:34,420 --> 01:08:35,529
I’m sorry.

1062
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:36,779
I’m sorry.

1063
01:08:36,779 --> 01:08:38,279
No, it’s okay.

1064
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:54,850
What?

1065
01:09:53,790 --> 01:09:56,650
(Next episode preview)

1066
01:09:57,590 --> 01:09:59,040
Han Gye-jeol, wake up.

1067

Han Gye-jeol, wake up.

1068
01:09:59,310 --> 01:09:59,430
(Thanks to special appearance of Jeong A-mi.)

1069
01:09:59,430 --> 01:10:00,640
I told you to stay at the hospital.
(Thanks to special appearance of Jeong A-mi.)

1070
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,960
I told you to stay at the hospital.

1071
01:10:01,960 --> 01:10:03,310
I think it’s more comfortable here.

1072
01:10:03,310 --> 01:10:04,440
I feel more at ease.

1073
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,660
To you who wants us to be together,

1074
01:10:06,660 --> 01:10:08,780
how can I say goodbye?

1075
01:10:08,780 --> 01:10:11,410
It’s been less than twenty days
before Lord Deity disappears.

1076
01:10:11,410 --> 01:10:12,440
What does that mean?

1077
01:10:12,440 --> 01:10:13,660
Disappear?

1078
01:10:14,270 --> 01:10:15,690
I won’t go to the underworld.

1079
01:10:15,690 --> 01:10:17,280
If you don’t, you’ll die.

1080
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:18,810
But I have to give it a try.

1081
01:10:18,810 --> 01:10:20,210
Deity,

1082
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:23,090
have you already gone?
