00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:02,050
(Episode 7)

2
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,660
(Jang Mi-sun (58))

3
00:00:15,590 --> 00:00:16,930
Your delivery is here.

4
00:00:31,580 --> 00:00:32,580
Give it to me.

5
00:00:32,580 --> 00:00:34,180
It’s a bit heavy.

6
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:37,510
Thanks.

7
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:57,720
I’m going to die soon.

8
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,850
When I know this,

9
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:04,069
who I want to see most is…

10
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,820
Please, please, come back!

11
00:01:12,820 --> 00:01:14,750
Come back, Professor!

12
00:01:23,990 --> 00:01:25,150
Dr. Han…

13
00:01:29,630 --> 00:01:31,350
Are you okay?

14
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,390
Here…

15
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:34,800
Where the hell is here?

16
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:46,110
What happened, Deity?

17
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,900
Are you having another headache or are you in a trance?

18
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:52,660
I’m sorry, Deity.

19
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:57,210
I’ve been too anxious and said what I shouldn’t say.

20
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:58,780
Who is Deity?

21
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,480
Why are you calling me like this?

22
00:02:05,590 --> 00:02:08,550
Prof. Do.

23
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:16,450
Well, why am I in the operating room?

24
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:24,710
And, why is the patient alone in there?

25
00:02:24,710 --> 00:02:27,070
Why don't they hurry up and operate?

26
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:30,100
Someone set a fire in the emergency center.

27
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:33,000
Everyone's taking refuge because they're worried about the oxygen tank exploding.

28
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,200
So they just left the patient alone?

29
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,160
Just let her die like this?

30
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,390
Are they out of their mind?

31
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:40,829
Who's in charge?

32
00:02:40,829 --> 00:02:42,990
Is it Prof. Bak Seung-eun or Prof. Kim Tae-hyeong?

33
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:44,560
What's wrong?

34
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,930
What do you want to do to know this?

35
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:48,540
What do you mean? Call them to come over right now!

36
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:57,530
Open your eyes,

37
00:02:57,530 --> 00:03:01,060
this is not Seoul Pilseong Hospital, but Yeongpo Pilseong Hospital.

38
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:03,760
And you, Professor, are not the Chief of Planning Office anymore.

39
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:06,370
They won’t come here because you call.

40
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:08,700
What do you mean.

41
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:10,910
No matter what,

42
00:03:10,910 --> 00:03:14,300
the patient is in such a critical situation.

43
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:17,750
I was in a hurry, and I thought about doing the surgery myself.

44
00:03:17,750 --> 00:03:19,090
So, Dr. Han...

45
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:23,130
You're in emergency medicine. You haven't done any surgery, right?

46
00:03:23,130 --> 00:03:25,370
Yes, that's right.

47
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:28,470
So do you want to be irresponsible when facing patients?

48
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:30,590
That's why I'm explaining to you in advance.

49
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,990
I was really in a hurry.

50
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:34,590
Why were you so loud?

51
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:37,560
Why don't you wait here while I go and see if I can call someone?

52
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:40,970
I'm afraid we don't have that much time.

53
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:43,320
Dr. Han, you've worked as an assistant, right?

54
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,960
Yes, what?

55
00:03:46,470 --> 00:03:48,900
I can't just watch a patient die in the hospital.

56
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,370
I'll do the surgery.

57
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:54,829
Scalpel.

58
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:10,220
Suction pump.

59
00:04:12,490 --> 00:04:13,690
Retractor.

60
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:19,970
Take it away.

61
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:29,190
Professor, the pregnant woman's blood pressure...

62
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,040
Save the baby first.

63
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:36,850
I get it. Pull it out on the count of three

64
00:04:36,850 --> 00:04:37,750
Press hard.

65
00:04:37,750 --> 00:04:39,790
One, two, three.

66
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:06,560
The child's breathing and heartbeat, normal.

67
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:08,530
Dr. Han, come help me.

68
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:14,560
What did you do? What are you doing?

69
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,410
Dr. Han.

70
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:19,440
Doctor, please take care of the baby.

71
00:05:33,450 --> 00:05:36,540
The mom's blood pressure, normal.

72
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:44,950
Professor, your hand...

73
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:47,430
Nothing. Just a scratch.

74
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:00,700
Professor Choi, what were you doing?

75
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:03,100
Your patient almost died.

76
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:06,550
As you know, Chief of Planning Office, the situation was too urgent.

77
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,740
No matter how urgent it is, in principle, you should check the situation in the operating room first.

78
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,070
We've been over the guidelines for emergency situations many times.

79
00:06:11,070 --> 00:06:13,730
Are you still not familiar with the contents?

80
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:17,020
Well, Professor, you cannot do that here.

81
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:20,690
Did you take the 12-hour medical training seriously?

82
00:06:20,690 --> 00:06:23,230
How can you do this as someone who has attended the training?

83
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:23,930
Wait, what?

84
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:25,470
(Yeongpo Pilseong Hospital)
Wait, what?

85
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,700
What are you doing?
(Yeongpo Pilseong Hospital)

86
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,690
You're going to keep talking like this, just having a bit of memory back?
(Yeongpo Pilseong Hospital)

87
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,640
You're going to keep talking like this, just having a bit of memory back?

88
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,110
Well,

89
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:34,500
I always thought that Chief was a job title, but it seems to be a disease name?

90
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:37,440
Chief disease?

91
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,760
I've been so confused since just now.

92
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:41,270
Dr. Han,

93
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:42,860
why are you so rude to me?

94
00:06:42,860 --> 00:06:43,990
Are you going to say,

95
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:46,080
you are the first woman who treat me like this or something like that?

96
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:48,010
You are.

97
00:06:48,010 --> 00:06:49,870
When we met again in Yeongpo,

98
00:06:49,870 --> 00:06:52,200
you were still hooking up with me.

99
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:55,020
That does not count as rude, isn’t it?

100
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,440
Yeongpo?

101
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,950
Why did we meet in Yeongpo?

102
00:07:01,110 --> 00:07:05,220
Because you, Professor,

103
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,350
escaped to Youngpo through the Cheong Hak Dong.

104
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:14,710
What are you taking about? What’s Cheong Hak Dong?

105
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:18,710
Why did I flee to Yeongpo?

106
00:07:21,540 --> 00:07:23,480
It seems that the fever hasn't gone away yet.

107
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:27,260
Why are you touching me so freely?

108
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:35,530
That's right, touching you freely, treating you rudely, and talking nonsense.

109
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:39,530
Is it a matter of words or hands?

110
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:43,620
I don't know what the problem is.

111
00:07:45,590 --> 00:07:46,690
Professor...

112
00:07:48,450 --> 00:07:50,909
Where did you start to lose your memory?

113
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:53,290
Wait,

114
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,570
what do you still remember?

115
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,240
Until the day I decided to go to court with you.

116
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:12,620
Wait… What’s the date today?

117
00:08:19,980 --> 00:08:20,930
(Friday, September 23rd)

118
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:24,930
September 23rd?

119
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,920
Really? Is that right?

120
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,220
So I've been in this hospital for 40 days?

121
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:46,150
You don't remember that you're Deity?

122
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,240
Really? You really don't remember anything?

123
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:14,720
Lord Deity, Deity, Deity!

124
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,670
What's going on?

125
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,670
You're here early. What,

126
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:23,860
why don't you just spend 99 days sweetly with each other and then come back?

127
00:09:23,860 --> 00:09:27,590
I would have cut off all your limbs for the pillars of the Jeondeugsa.

128
00:09:27,590 --> 00:09:30,970
So that I can help the temple and also accumulate merit. How good it is!

129
00:09:30,970 --> 00:09:33,660
That’s really fucking awful.
(Note: "family" and "fucking" are homophones.)

130
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:36,570
Ok Shin, are you swearing me?

131
00:09:36,570 --> 00:09:39,990
Like family, like family, we are family.

132
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,440
How dare you despise me?

133
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:43,360
Do you think it's funny that I've been made to be like this by a mere human?

134
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:44,090
Let's fight!

135
00:09:44,090 --> 00:09:47,840
I'll show you the spirit of a Goryeo warrior!

136
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,030
Lord Deity, Lord Deity.

137
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,440
Lord Deity, stop being like this. Is this the right time to talk about spirit?

138
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:53,250
Then what should we discuss?

139
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:56,380
Okay, let's not talk about bravery, let's talk about confession.

140
00:09:56,380 --> 00:09:57,380
Confession?

141
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,520
Didn't you say that if I pretend to be Do Jin-woo, I will receive the confession?
(The pronunciation of "confession" in Korean is similar to "go back")

142
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,510
Do Jin-woo is there, and Deity, he’s back!

143
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,630
Is this the confession you told me?

144
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:08,300
Wait, who would've thought that Han Gye-jeol could even save Do Jin-woo?

145
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
Lord Deity, at least you have more than 50 days left.

146
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:11,550
In the meantime, let's find a way...

147
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:12,960
7 days left.

148
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,810
You can't even count now?

149
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:18,040
99 days, and now more than 40 days have passed. That's 99 minus 40...

150
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:23,220
Shut up! It's exactly 42 days after Do Jin-woo’s death, so 7 days left!

151
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:25,530
What does that mean?

152
00:10:25,530 --> 00:10:29,410
A soul can only live 49 days, and so does Do Jin-woo.

153
00:10:29,410 --> 00:10:31,990
What will happen if Do Jin Woo lives another 7 days and fills 49 days?

154
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:35,050
He'll lose his soul, lose his mind, and his body will collapse and rot.

155
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:36,550
Even if I have 50 days left,

156
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:39,110
what can I do in a rotting body like that?

157
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:42,070
My eyes are falling out, and my body is crawling with maggots.

158
00:10:42,070 --> 00:10:43,800
Please love me. Please love me.

159
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:45,930
Am I going to haunt her like this?

160
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:47,890
In other word...

161
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:51,610
I can’t die in this life.

162
00:10:53,230 --> 00:10:54,680
I guess so.

163
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,830
Do Jin-woo is back, so Han Gye-jeol will never find you.

164
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:02,180
And you'll have to wait another 99 years.

165
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:04,710
What? You think I deserve it?

166
00:11:04,710 --> 00:11:06,590
No way.

167
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:11,070
Lord Deity, you must trust me completely this time.

168
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,840
I, Ok Shin, will do whatever I can within these 7 days,

169
00:11:14,840 --> 00:11:19,770
to let Han Gye-jeol send Do Jin-woo... nope, bring you back.

170
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:21,500
I will do it.

171
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,900
How can I trust a stone head like you?

172
00:11:23,900 --> 00:11:28,330
My life is miserable, how miserable, damn it!

173
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,630
Oh, if you're lying on the ground...

174
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:31,340
How annoying.

175
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,900
Help him up!

176
00:11:43,500 --> 00:11:44,620
Thank you.

177
00:11:53,910 --> 00:11:58,890
If only the memory changes, how can you become a completely different person?

178
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,050
What?

179
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:05,080
You don’t even sit in the same way.

180
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:09,320
Deity…

181
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:11,600
He sits in a very relaxed way.

182
00:12:13,070 --> 00:12:16,250
Is my name Deity,

183
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:19,770
or Puppet or something?

184
00:12:19,770 --> 00:12:23,380
It’s Deity, not Puppet.

185
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:25,760
Look, you wrote it yourself.

186
00:12:25,790 --> 00:12:26,870
(Deity)

187
00:12:29,050 --> 00:12:32,460
What Deity, who’s this?

188
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,500
The only guide on the road to hades.

189
00:12:34,500 --> 00:12:35,830
Is it an underworld agent?

190
00:12:35,830 --> 00:12:40,270
What agent? He is the unbeatable king on the road to hades.

191
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:49,220
Sorry, I've always been brainwashed by Deity.

192
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,350
But why do I have to claim that I'm Deity?

193
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:56,900
I don’t even know him well myself.

194
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:03,170
I don't know that either.

195
00:13:03,170 --> 00:13:07,740
Then I opened this hospital for you and did not let you go anywhere?

196
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:12,400
How could it be?

197
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:16,730
But, how can a person without memory open a hospital like this?

198
00:13:16,730 --> 00:13:17,700
Well…

199
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,420
The hospital is opened with money. Although I don’t have memory, I have a lot of money.

200
00:13:22,950 --> 00:13:26,950
You don’t need memory to open a hospital. You spent money, of course.

201
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:32,530
Professor, you have no memory, but you have a lot of money.

202
00:13:32,530 --> 00:13:36,340
And you gave me a windfall last time, don't you remember?

203
00:13:39,030 --> 00:13:42,490
I should have made a good profit at that time.

204
00:13:42,490 --> 00:13:46,560
No way, if I had that much money,

205
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,770
I would still need to recruit you to Pilseong?

206
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:52,890
I would have offered to open a hospital for you to help testify, right?

207
00:13:54,330 --> 00:13:56,780
That's true.

208
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,180
I guess it’s because you didn’t know the secret of birth at that time,

209
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:06,390
and you know it until now.

210
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:08,770
The what of birth?

211
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,080
As long as it's a plutocrat family, there's always a secret of birth.

212
00:14:13,080 --> 00:14:15,990
You know the Bulhwa Company of the top 10 plutocrats？

213
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:20,130
After learning about it, I found out that you are from that company.

214
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:21,750
They are afraid that the already falling stock price

215
00:14:21,750 --> 00:14:23,610
will plummet because of this unpleasant rumor.

216
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:26,560
That's why president I Eung-chul kept it a secret.

217
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:27,430
Dr. Han?

218
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:28,760
Yes?

219
00:14:28,760 --> 00:14:31,740
Did you fall down with me?

220
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,590
Fall? Me? From where?

221
00:14:34,590 --> 00:14:37,990
No, you don't look normal to me.

222
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,010
You're...

223
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:43,950
Well, just take a look and you'll see.

224
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,430
Why did you take my phone?

225
00:14:45,430 --> 00:14:45,800
(Gak Shin Uneducated Ok Shin Han Gye-jeol)
Why did you take my phone?

226
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:49,270
It’s the president I Eung-chul.
(Gak Shin Uneducated Ok Shin Han Gye-jeol)

227
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,290
Yes, I should have it.

228
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,800
(Uneducated)

229
00:15:02,740 --> 00:15:06,810
But why did I call Jeong-won like this?

230
00:15:06,810 --> 00:15:11,270
That's because Deity has an eye for people.

231
00:15:11,270 --> 00:15:12,080
No.

232
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,720
It's better if you don't contact Jeong-won for now.

233
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,110
She's probably angry right now.

234
00:15:25,110 --> 00:15:26,920
You won't hear anything good.

235
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,710
It's during this time that you don't know.

236
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:33,840
Something happened between you.

237
00:15:33,840 --> 00:15:37,430
I'll decide myself whether to call or not.

238
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,090
This is not your business.

239
00:15:40,090 --> 00:15:41,550
Although I appreciate you helping me,

240
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:44,910
I still hope you can keep the bottom line.

241
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,640
That's so frustrating.

242
00:15:54,540 --> 00:16:00,380
-What? -Wait, at night, you called for the bed, the blanket, and the humidifier.

243
00:16:00,380 --> 00:16:02,690
When you need, you let me take care of you.

244
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:05,610
And now you're saying you don't want me to take care of anything else?

245
00:16:05,610 --> 00:16:07,740
Your manners are like shit.

246
00:16:07,740 --> 00:16:08,830
How can you say it's shit?

247
00:16:08,830 --> 00:16:10,760
And what's the bottom line?

248
00:16:10,760 --> 00:16:13,010
You keep your distance freely and you get angry.

249
00:16:13,010 --> 00:16:15,500
That's a very unorthodox thing to do, okay?

250
00:16:17,350 --> 00:16:20,560
I'm sorry for the trouble I caused you.

251
00:16:22,010 --> 00:16:23,870
Aren't you sorry about the rest?

252
00:16:23,870 --> 00:16:26,140
If I would feel sorry afterwards,

253
00:16:26,140 --> 00:16:27,410
I wouldn't have done it in the first place.

254
00:16:28,840 --> 00:16:33,920
Professor, are you really like this?

255
00:16:35,010 --> 00:16:35,940
What?

256
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:43,650
Yes, you have never changed.

257
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:46,800
You don't make up rumors, and people don’t know what's going on in your mind.

258
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:52,990
Professor Do, that's who you are.

259
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:58,400
Dr. Han, are you like this?

260
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,380
Me?

261
00:16:59,380 --> 00:17:02,020
You believe in lies and get angry easily.

262
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:04,349
And you speak your mind so easily.

263
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:07,790
I didn't know you were like that.

264
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:12,530
That's who I am,

265
00:17:12,530 --> 00:17:14,319
in front of Deity.

266
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,270
Really good ah.

267
00:17:26,369 --> 00:17:30,160
(Medical staff: Director Han Gye-jeol

268
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,190
I am waiting for this person.

269
00:17:31,190 --> 00:17:33,700
I am waiting for this person.

270
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:36,590
It is for this person to prepare the position, right.

271
00:17:39,110 --> 00:17:40,400
Obviously correct.

272
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,480
The King of the road to hades.

273
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,700
Did you go home after a short excursion?

274
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,730
Why don't you say goodbye before you leave?

275
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:56,410
Lord Deity.

276
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:01,640
Lord Deity, you can see me?

277
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,800
This is a mirror that was made in the Goguryeo era along with the drum.

278
00:19:09,800 --> 00:19:13,300
It's a mirror for national events.

279
00:19:13,300 --> 00:19:15,150
I didn't expect it to be used for surveillance.

280
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,500
Why do you have such a treasure in your hand?

281
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,660
Do you think you are the Princess Myeongnyang?

282
00:19:23,020 --> 00:19:27,790
Lord Deity, this is the unique gift in the world.

283
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,400
You mustn't break it.

284
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,510
Understand, Lord Deity?

285
00:19:31,510 --> 00:19:32,360
Deity…

286
00:19:36,470 --> 00:19:41,630
What's Do Jin-woo doing here?

287
00:19:41,630 --> 00:19:43,870
You know me too?

288
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:46,870
You're our landlord, how could I not know you?

289
00:19:46,870 --> 00:19:48,170
I’m Seo Bok-gyeong.

290
00:19:50,030 --> 00:19:51,810
I’m Do Jin-woo.

291
00:19:51,810 --> 00:19:54,880
But you've been a model before? You've got a nice stance.

292
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:58,890
What model? You're just talking nonsense.

293
00:19:58,890 --> 00:20:00,670
Are you saying I’m better than Deity?

294
00:20:00,670 --> 00:20:03,170
How do you know our Lord Deity?

295
00:20:03,170 --> 00:20:07,580
You're not remembering anything, are you?

296
00:20:07,580 --> 00:20:12,360
Dr. Han said I lived with the name of Deity for over 40 days.

297
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,810
But then again...

298
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:18,390
Haven't we met somewhere before?

299
00:20:19,370 --> 00:20:21,040
Have we?

300
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:24,120
I've seen you a lot, Do Jin-woo.

301
00:20:25,070 --> 00:20:26,550
I saw you 99 years ago,

302
00:20:26,550 --> 00:20:28,070
198 years ago,

303
00:20:28,070 --> 00:20:30,330
and 297 years ago.

304
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,500
But this is the first time I've seen Do Jin-woo who is so good at striking up a conversation.

305
00:20:33,500 --> 00:20:36,210
I’m not striking up the conversation, I’m just telling the truth.

306
00:20:36,210 --> 00:20:38,250
Because I remember exactly where I've seen you before.

307
00:20:38,780 --> 00:20:39,980
You do?

308
00:20:40,940 --> 00:20:43,080
Where did you meet me?

309
00:20:50,290 --> 00:20:51,500
It’s Han Gye-jeol.

310
00:20:51,500 --> 00:20:52,530
Han Gye-jeol.

311
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:55,620
You’ve known each other?

312
00:20:55,620 --> 00:20:57,220
Yes.

313
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:03,500
I’m going to meet Jeong-won first.

314
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:07,230
I've been thinking all night about why Yeongpo,

315
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:09,890
probably, it’s because of Jeong-won.

316
00:21:09,890 --> 00:21:13,000
I must have done something wrong and I need to apologize.

317
00:21:13,600 --> 00:21:15,490
But I forgot about the 40 days for no reason.

318
00:21:15,490 --> 00:21:17,960
I don't know if she'll still forgive me.

319
00:21:17,960 --> 00:21:19,450
But at least I'm going to try first.

320
00:21:20,350 --> 00:21:22,680
The forgotten time

321
00:21:23,630 --> 00:21:24,910
doesn’t exist in this world.

322
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:32,240
Professor, during the time you were away,

323
00:21:33,450 --> 00:21:40,390
there are people, feelings and commitments.

324
00:21:41,330 --> 00:21:45,650
You mean I had an emotional commitment

325
00:21:45,650 --> 00:21:47,710
with someone?

326
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:56,230
I'm sorry.

327
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,170
Sorry for what?

328
00:22:02,830 --> 00:22:04,830
That you're mentally unstable and you've been troubling me?

329
00:22:04,830 --> 00:22:06,630
Or the fact that you had to leave after you sobered up?

330
00:22:09,260 --> 00:22:11,050
I made a big mistake inadvertently.

331
00:22:11,050 --> 00:22:12,230
Yes, you did.

332
00:22:12,230 --> 00:22:14,370
Did you inadvertently slip your tongue again?

333
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:15,710
No.

334
00:22:15,710 --> 00:22:17,260
You ruined a person's life, so it was a mistake?

335
00:22:17,260 --> 00:22:18,040
No, not either.

336
00:22:18,040 --> 00:22:20,450
It's called bad words because they cause serious mental damage.

337
00:22:26,260 --> 00:22:27,920
Why do I keep thinking of such things?

338
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,420
So annoying.

339
00:22:36,710 --> 00:22:39,330
I'm telling you this,

340
00:22:39,330 --> 00:22:41,730
because I wish I will be your last mistake.

341
00:22:41,730 --> 00:22:42,470
What?

342
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,500
Tae Jeong-won knows that too.

343
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:49,560
So that’s why Jeong-won…

344
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:54,290
Sorry.

345
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,990
So why do you expect something from someone like Do Jin-woo?

346
00:23:13,990 --> 00:23:14,740
What the hell.

347
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:22,790
Han Gye-jeol.

348
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:25,750
Can you hear me?

349
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:30,820
How can it be possible.

350
00:23:53,530 --> 00:23:57,560
I’ve heard from Captain Baek, Gim Yang-ja.

351
00:23:58,760 --> 00:24:00,240
You go in first and try washing dishes.

352
00:24:01,330 --> 00:24:03,450
Thank you, thank you.

353
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,070
There aren't many customers.

354
00:24:11,070 --> 00:24:12,350
Do you still need people to do part-time job?

355
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:13,840
It’s said his nephew's wife is starving to death.

356
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:15,290
Captain Baek has been pleading with me,

357
00:24:15,290 --> 00:24:17,630
how can I, Sim Hong-geun, just sit back and do nothing?

358
00:24:18,270 --> 00:24:20,980
It’s said she has nowhere to go but here.

359
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:22,780
If we help her, probably we'll be blessed in the future.

360
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:24,500
Come and sit down for a while.

361
00:24:26,810 --> 00:24:28,300
What's wrong now?

362
00:24:29,350 --> 00:24:31,220
Come and take a rest.

363
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:36,350
It’s said that if you keep sunbathing like this,

364
00:24:36,350 --> 00:24:37,970
you can also prevent bad diseases.

365
00:24:38,920 --> 00:24:41,170
You think you are a doctor after being ill?

366
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:45,810
It’s Johns.

367
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:49,940
It’s good to be a doctor.

368
00:24:49,940 --> 00:24:51,980
Surely they don’t have to spend a large amount of money on medical treatment, don’t you think so?

369
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:57,040
Johns.

370
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:58,440
Are you calling me?

371
00:24:59,340 --> 00:25:00,900
Maybe you are calling to a wrong person.

372
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,010
There's nothing in my body that doesn't hurt these days.

373
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:06,160
I'm not interested.

374
00:25:07,260 --> 00:25:08,250
What?

375
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,790
I'm not interested in the jade floor or the ancestor gods.

376
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:12,720
Jade floor? Ancestor Gods?

377
00:25:14,420 --> 00:25:15,210
My love,

378
00:25:15,210 --> 00:25:17,220
we’ve been totally ignored, right?

379
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:19,350
The uneducated bastard,

380
00:25:19,350 --> 00:25:21,080
how dare you ignore the wife of Sim Hong-geun?

381
00:25:22,810 --> 00:25:23,550
Forget it.

382
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:24,900
Don’t argue with the likes of him.

383
00:25:24,900 --> 00:25:27,130
Didn't you say we're done?

384
00:25:27,880 --> 00:25:29,310
Didn't you tell me to accept the truth?

385
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:31,130
So I accepted it.

386
00:25:31,130 --> 00:25:32,620
Why are you still calling me?

387
00:25:32,620 --> 00:25:35,050
Am I an easy girl

388
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:36,180
to you?

389
00:25:36,180 --> 00:25:37,860
You must think my words are strange.

390
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:40,470
But it's like I've entered Alice's Wonderland.

391
00:25:40,470 --> 00:25:42,200
This world is not the world I know.

392
00:25:42,200 --> 00:25:43,940
And the people aren't the people I know.

393
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,160
There's no one who can think properly.

394
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:47,530
And there's no one who can talk properly.

395
00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:50,010
I want to escape from this dislocated world.

396
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:51,740
Please help me.

397
00:25:55,790 --> 00:25:57,080
Where are you?

398
00:25:58,050 --> 00:25:59,060
I'm coming over now.

399
00:25:59,060 --> 00:26:00,090
Wait for me.

400
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,130
Please go to Yeongpo Pilseong.

401
00:26:12,750 --> 00:26:14,650
It's weird.

402
00:26:15,810 --> 00:26:16,810
It's really weird.

403
00:26:19,570 --> 00:26:21,220
What happened?

404
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:22,910
Schizophrenia?

405
00:26:24,270 --> 00:26:25,360
Well, maybe.

406
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:28,910
Check it out today.

407
00:26:37,420 --> 00:26:39,000
Yu A-in?

408
00:26:39,970 --> 00:26:41,510
I’m Detective Han Chul.

409
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:45,120
A detective with such a bad memory,

410
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:46,770
let me really worried about the safety of the citizens.

411
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,960
What?

412
00:26:47,960 --> 00:26:50,270
Did you forget that you lost the sport,

413
00:26:50,270 --> 00:26:52,630
or that you'd stop coming to me
if you lost?

414
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,630
Whatever it is, you've forgotten,

415
00:26:54,630 --> 00:26:57,340
so you're here to see me again.

416
00:26:57,340 --> 00:27:00,870
Or it's not about the investigation or anything,

417
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:01,860
it's about your personal desire to see me.

418
00:27:01,860 --> 00:27:04,180
A doctor with such a bad memory,

419
00:27:04,180 --> 00:27:06,210
let me really worried about the health of the patients.

420
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,170
What?

421
00:27:07,170 --> 00:27:10,320
I told you that
you weren't pretty enough for me to like.

422
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:12,740
You don't remember,
so you're just being self-absorbed again.

423
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:14,470
I have no interest in finding the killer.

424
00:27:14,470 --> 00:27:15,830
I also told you.

425
00:27:15,830 --> 00:27:19,100
You should be interested,
because I'm not here to ask for help.

426
00:27:21,710 --> 00:27:24,260
The day Choe Gwang-mo died,
was the man you saw

427
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,640
Professor Do Jin-woo?

428
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,210
Jin-woo?

429
00:27:31,970 --> 00:27:33,810
No, it's not possible at all.

430
00:27:34,330 --> 00:27:36,540
Look at this photo,
you'll think it is possible.

431
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:41,590
What's this?

432
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:44,710
The car the killer left behind,
which was found at the scene.

433
00:27:45,970 --> 00:27:47,350
Professor Do Jin-woo, right?

434
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:52,130
So are you suspecting that

435
00:27:52,130 --> 00:27:54,550
Professor Do Jin-woo is the murderer?

436
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:55,720
Yes.

437
00:27:56,530 --> 00:28:00,120
Why would a doctor... kill someone?

438
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:02,790
We'll know if we see him.

439
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,890
We'll know the motive
when we investigate.

440
00:28:07,070 --> 00:28:08,690
Are you serious?

441
00:28:08,690 --> 00:28:10,710
Are you close to Professor Do Jin-woo?

442
00:28:10,710 --> 00:28:12,090
Is that why you pretend not to know?

443
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,600
Where is he now?

444
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:15,730
I don't know.

445
00:28:15,730 --> 00:28:19,200
Article 1 of Article 151 of the Criminal Law.
Anyone who helps an offender hide or escape

446
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:21,890
will be sentenced to up to three years in prison
or fined up to 5 million won.

447
00:28:22,530 --> 00:28:23,830
If you help him hide because you're close,

448
00:28:23,830 --> 00:28:26,060
you'll become a lawbreaker too.

449
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:31,960
I'm coming over now. Wait for me.

450
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:35,220
I haven't seen him lately either,

451
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:37,240
so I need to ask around.

452
00:28:37,240 --> 00:28:39,740
But I can't ask here, right?

453
00:28:39,740 --> 00:28:42,290
Let's talk outside.

454
00:28:43,570 --> 00:28:44,300
Jin-woo.

455
00:28:45,630 --> 00:28:46,980
You are...

456
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:52,510
Do Jin-woo, you're under arrest
for the murder of Choe Gwang-mo.

457
00:28:52,510 --> 00:28:53,880
(Arrest Warrant)
Do Jin-woo, you're under arrest
for the murder of Choe Gwang-mo.

458
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,480
Do Jin-woo, you're under arrest
for the murder of Choe Gwang-mo.

459
00:28:57,300 --> 00:28:58,340
What?

460
00:29:05,130 --> 00:29:06,430
(Yeongpo Police Station)

461
00:29:07,390 --> 00:29:13,040
Name, Choe Gwang-mo, age 38. I've seen him before.

462
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:16,170
So I know he's actually a villain
who doesn't even deserve to be called a victim.

463
00:29:16,170 --> 00:29:19,150
He adopted a child and then abused him, and even tried to kill him.

464
00:29:20,280 --> 00:29:22,740
There are many evil people in the world
in that way.

465
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:25,880
Do I have to kill that person?

466
00:29:28,050 --> 00:29:29,860
You have a record of being adopted too.

467
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:36,910
Is it because you are an adoptee
and you feel the same way?

468
00:29:36,910 --> 00:29:38,930
A helpless child is dying.

469
00:29:38,930 --> 00:29:40,930
But you can't do anything about it,
so you felt sorry.

470
00:29:40,930 --> 00:29:43,070
So you think I did something to get revenge?

471
00:29:44,510 --> 00:29:45,550
Does that make sense?

472
00:29:47,350 --> 00:29:50,070
More motives for a crime
doesn’t make sense.

473
00:29:50,070 --> 00:29:54,390
I'm so unlucky, why are you laughing?
So some people killed the entire family.

474
00:29:54,390 --> 00:29:57,830
Because the bank was open late,
so an elderly set fire to it.

475
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,610
Because he looked like ex-husband,
so the lady beat him up.

476
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:04,890
I've seen a lot of different kinds of that.

477
00:30:04,890 --> 00:30:07,820
I feel that everything is possible in the world.

478
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:10,160
As a detective, don't write fiction.

479
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,700
Show me the evidence.

480
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:13,240
Evidence?

481
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,310
You like that?

482
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:19,820
The crime took place at around 9:39 p.m.

483
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:22,450
This is the vehicle that
escaped from the hospital five minutes later.

484
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,690
The driver is you, right?

485
00:30:31,110 --> 00:30:33,700
This is the back of the suspect
captured by the surveillance footage on the crime scene.

486
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:36,800
The outfits are the same, right?

487
00:30:44,730 --> 00:30:46,910
You killed Choe Gwang-mo, right?

488
00:30:47,920 --> 00:30:51,280
I don't know. About 40 days ago,
I fell off a building.

489
00:30:52,290 --> 00:30:53,680
I don't remember anything after that.

490
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:56,230
Do you think this is some kind of hearing?

491
00:30:56,230 --> 00:30:58,360
I've never been there, never killed anyone,
I don't know.

492
00:30:58,360 --> 00:30:59,880
Can you just say that?

493
00:31:01,580 --> 00:31:03,160
I really can't remember anything.

494
00:31:29,740 --> 00:31:30,660
Mom.

495
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:52,790
Please, please wake up!

496
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:55,740
Wake up, Professor!

497
00:32:14,450 --> 00:32:16,570
He's really in bad condition.

498
00:32:18,070 --> 00:32:18,640
Hey,

499
00:32:19,460 --> 00:32:22,340
if this goes on,
will he advocate a weak mind?

500
00:32:23,140 --> 00:32:25,630
I don't think he's going to do that so soon.

501
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,500
I think he'll try to find a group
that can help him first.

502
00:32:38,860 --> 00:32:41,380
I have to think about it anyway.

503
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:43,090
I can't think of anything.

504
00:32:43,090 --> 00:32:44,390
Everything...

505
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:51,870
(Address Book)

506
00:33:06,340 --> 00:33:07,440
So who is it?

507
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:08,660
Your accomplice.

508
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,990
Please summon Bulhwa Company’s President I Eung-chul.

509
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:14,810
Bulhwa Company?

510
00:33:18,530 --> 00:33:20,330
(Bulhwa Company, Byeon Chang-u)

511
00:33:21,770 --> 00:33:24,310
We’ve received the result of release
for the review of the legality of arrest and have been released.

512
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,760
We'll take Mr. Do Jin-woo away.

513
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:27,880
Did the court grant the request for relief?

514
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:28,720
Why?

515
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:33,060
You said he escaped from the hospital at 9:44.

516
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:37,430
This is the surveillance footage 25km away from the crime scene.

517
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:39,700
The time on it is 9:46.

518
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,350
No one in the world

519
00:33:42,350 --> 00:33:44,670
can move 25 kilometers in two minutes, right?

520
00:33:44,670 --> 00:33:46,560
That's impossible.

521
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:57,520
What if it's instantaneous movement?

522
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:00,630
Wouldn't that be possible?

523
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,650
Then tell the judge that and try it.

524
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,690
Let's go.

525
00:34:09,690 --> 00:34:10,600
Mr. Do Jin-woo,

526
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:16,130
what exactly is your relationship
with the Bulhwa Company?

527
00:34:16,460 --> 00:34:18,270
I need to look into it from now on.

528
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:30,530
How did you get here?

529
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,650
I didn't expect you to find me, Jin-woo.

530
00:34:34,760 --> 00:34:36,210
Dr. Han told me

531
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,310
there was a secret to the birth.

532
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:40,250
Yes.

533
00:34:40,250 --> 00:34:41,510
There is a birth secret.

534
00:34:42,600 --> 00:34:44,270
What other secrets do I need to know?

535
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,010
The Deity is the real murderer?

536
00:34:49,570 --> 00:34:51,060
That's a bit...

537
00:34:51,060 --> 00:34:52,350
How dare you say
there's a murderer in our family?

538
00:34:52,350 --> 00:34:53,960
Are you out of your mind?

539
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,520
I was arrested for murder.

540
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,390
You don't seem to be shocked at all, sir.

541
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,350
It's as if you knew this would happen.

542
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,020
Of course I was shocked.

543
00:35:03,020 --> 00:35:04,180
It was a big shock.

544
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:06,660
I was so shocked that
my hair turned white and my mind was empty.

545
00:35:06,660 --> 00:35:08,070
Now I've recovered a bit.

546
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,950
You said you can't think of anything,
but the response was very fast.

547
00:35:11,690 --> 00:35:14,270
It was as if you had prepared the evidence in advance.

548
00:35:15,680 --> 00:35:18,200
I don't want to take the blame for Lord Deity.

549
00:35:19,730 --> 00:35:20,790
I'll keep it a secret.

550
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:24,770
I need you to keep protecting me.

551
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:26,910
You...

552
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:30,730
Now you're denying it with no memory.

553
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,690
Deity?

554
00:35:31,690 --> 00:35:33,550
Deity is you.

555
00:35:33,550 --> 00:35:36,030
Why do you always talk like
it's someone else's business?

556
00:35:36,030 --> 00:35:36,680
Now.

557
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:46,820
I'm afraid of dogs,

558
00:35:46,820 --> 00:35:48,550
because I was bitten as a child.

559
00:35:49,240 --> 00:35:51,540
I can't even think about
being this close to a dog.

560
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,610
I told Dr. Han before.

561
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,400
I guess you haven't heard that yet.

562
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:58,310
Hasn't your memory changed?

563
00:35:58,310 --> 00:35:59,720
Your personality has also changed a little.

564
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,780
Your preferences will definitely change too.

565
00:36:03,030 --> 00:36:06,830
The human brain, which has completed its growth,
hates to learn new things.

566
00:36:06,830 --> 00:36:09,860
Because it takes a lot of energy
to create new nerve cells.

567
00:36:10,670 --> 00:36:13,550
So the formed preferences or habits

568
00:36:13,550 --> 00:36:15,620
can't be changed easily.

569
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,050
Amazing, medical student.

570
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:18,880
Fine.

571
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:19,970
Even if you're not Deity,

572
00:36:19,970 --> 00:36:22,210
then who is he?

573
00:36:22,210 --> 00:36:23,700
A doppelganger? Or a twin?

574
00:36:23,700 --> 00:36:25,320
Are you going to claim something like that?

575
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:27,520
That is only in some serials.

576
00:36:27,520 --> 00:36:30,310
But I can be sure of one thing: he is not human.

577
00:36:31,260 --> 00:36:32,140
What?

578
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,570
Just like you.

579
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,190
You bastard!

580
00:36:37,190 --> 00:36:39,610
I’m older that you.
How could you say I am not a human being?

581
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:41,310
Your words are so rude..

582
00:36:41,310 --> 00:36:46,350
Otherwise, there's no way to explain
the tinkle of the bells that keeps coming from you.

583
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:51,590
The exact same bells.

584
00:36:52,520 --> 00:36:53,570
I've heard it before.

585
00:36:55,250 --> 00:36:56,590
Just before I died.

586
00:37:00,570 --> 00:37:00,980
You said you were dead?

587
00:37:00,980 --> 00:37:02,380
How do you know that?

588
00:37:02,380 --> 00:37:03,640
What did you say?

589
00:37:07,330 --> 00:37:08,900
I'm actually dead.

590
00:37:12,150 --> 00:37:13,090
Well...

591
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,200
Maybe, do you recall any memories?

592
00:37:21,980 --> 00:37:24,070
I thought the mother I met on that dry road

593
00:37:25,550 --> 00:37:27,530
was just a nightmare,

594
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,540
but it turned out to be a memory.

595
00:37:34,870 --> 00:37:37,990
(Feiyun Clinic)

596
00:38:28,130 --> 00:38:31,280
All living things can recover themselves.

597
00:38:33,930 --> 00:38:38,600
The inability to recover may be another proof of death.

598
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:43,190
Who is he talking to?

599
00:38:44,500 --> 00:38:46,980
He's no ordinary lunatic.

600
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,010
So noisy!

601
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:49,510
Your identity has been exposed.
Look what you've done!

602
00:38:49,510 --> 00:38:51,020
Don’t be noisy!

603
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,130
Why are you still holding popcorn and eating it?

604
00:38:54,130 --> 00:38:56,400
With such a big head,
you can't even see the mirror.

605
00:38:57,690 --> 00:38:58,190
Annoying!

606
00:38:58,190 --> 00:38:59,160
Eat it!

607
00:39:11,290 --> 00:39:12,390
As expected,

608
00:39:14,210 --> 00:39:17,470
you’re looking at me from there, right? Lord Deity.

609
00:39:23,750 --> 00:39:31,460
I don't know why your soul
was attached to my dead body.

610
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:34,770
What do you want to do in the world?

611
00:39:34,770 --> 00:39:36,260
You’ve just understood that

612
00:39:37,790 --> 00:39:39,030
Look at you, young man.

613
00:39:39,260 --> 00:39:43,220
there's one person you can't give up

614
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:47,340
even if you’re just watching in the underworld.

615
00:39:49,930 --> 00:39:51,950
That's Han Gye-jeol.

616
00:39:58,800 --> 00:40:00,500
But what should I do?

617
00:40:04,750 --> 00:40:07,640
I'm afraid I can't give up Han Gye-jeol either.

618
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,890
What?

619
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:15,770
The memory of walking on the road to hades

620
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:20,440
always ends with Dr. Han's voice.

621
00:40:21,620 --> 00:40:24,800
The voice that brought me back

622
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:27,890
that woke me up from my slumber.

623
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,060
So as long as Dr. Han is by my side.

624
00:40:32,060 --> 00:40:33,770
As long as

625
00:40:35,140 --> 00:40:37,420
she calls me.

626
00:40:39,550 --> 00:40:43,620
I can be sure that
I won’t return to that strange land.

627
00:40:45,820 --> 00:40:47,910
Everyone has their own destiny,

628
00:40:47,910 --> 00:40:50,140
and that day is the day you will die.

629
00:40:50,140 --> 00:40:51,920
Even if you can escape for a while,

630
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,850
you'll die sooner or later.

631
00:40:53,850 --> 00:40:56,560
Just let it be.

632
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,950
Do you know when I found out
I was going to die,

633
00:41:01,250 --> 00:41:04,520
who I missed the most?

634
00:41:04,690 --> 00:41:06,180
Not my mother,

635
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:08,340
nor my lover.

636
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,960
To my surprise, it was me.

637
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,710
The one who is married,

638
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:19,730
with children,

639
00:41:19,730 --> 00:41:23,850
and caresses his grandchildren with wrinkled hands...

640
00:41:25,070 --> 00:41:27,480
the me who is far away in the future.

641
00:41:27,670 --> 00:41:30,210
At that time, I realized that

642
00:41:30,210 --> 00:41:32,910
I really,

643
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:35,020
really,

644
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,770
really wanted to come back to life.

645
00:41:42,940 --> 00:41:45,550
Once the attachment to life turns into obsession,

646
00:41:45,550 --> 00:41:47,410
human beings will become unfortunate.

647
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:50,080
Love, fame, and faith.

648
00:41:50,080 --> 00:41:52,400
All the values created by man for mankind

649
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:54,990
will be dulled and dried up.

650
00:41:56,170 --> 00:42:01,400
What kind of happiness can exist in the world,
which is as dark as the underworld?

651
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:03,860
So just give it up,

652
00:42:03,860 --> 00:42:06,100
for your own sake.

653
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,930
I

654
00:42:07,930 --> 00:42:11,310
will live no matter what.

655
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:15,060
I’ll stay with Dr. Han.

656
00:42:15,060 --> 00:42:17,610
I'll live even if I have to use her as a spell.

657
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:20,750
Who are you calling a spell!

658
00:42:20,750 --> 00:42:25,470
You dare to covet the woman of the gods of the underworld
and still want to live in peace?

659
00:42:25,470 --> 00:42:29,050
Han Gye-jeol won't find you.

660
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,940
Because I'll make her only

661
00:42:33,940 --> 00:42:36,550
look at me

662
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:40,630
and call on me.

663
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,340
Huh?

664
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:06,390
This is?

665
00:43:06,390 --> 00:43:07,720
Did you already know this?

666
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:09,130
Did you agree to become like this?

667
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:11,330
Where is the table here?

668
00:43:11,330 --> 00:43:12,860
I sent it to the recycling center.

669
00:43:12,860 --> 00:43:15,130
It is fashionable and nice.

670
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:17,370
I don't know if it is fashionable or not.

671
00:43:17,370 --> 00:43:18,860
But it isn't in good shape.

672
00:43:18,860 --> 00:43:20,050
And it's not my style.

673
00:43:20,050 --> 00:43:21,760
I don't care what your style is.
It's not your place.

674
00:43:21,760 --> 00:43:25,050
-Why did you take it away?
-If it's not mine, whose is it?

675
00:43:25,050 --> 00:43:26,400
It’s Lord Deity's place.

676
00:43:26,400 --> 00:43:28,230
You know that yourself, right?

677
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:32,400
Not now.

678
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:34,870
Because Deity has gone back.

679
00:43:34,870 --> 00:43:36,660
You should know that too.

680
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:38,410
My dear,

681
00:43:38,410 --> 00:43:42,920
do you forget how much Deity loved that table?

682
00:43:42,920 --> 00:43:44,710
A man who only uses brands

683
00:43:44,710 --> 00:43:46,630
said that the old-fashioned design is fashionable.

684
00:43:46,630 --> 00:43:47,940
He didn't know shame,

685
00:43:47,940 --> 00:43:50,430
putting name tags all over the table.

686
00:43:50,430 --> 00:43:53,290
Because you gave him the place,
he cherished it.

687
00:43:53,290 --> 00:43:55,820
How can he do anything with such a place?

688
00:43:55,820 --> 00:43:58,000
It hurts my heart.

689
00:44:00,980 --> 00:44:01,090
(Deity)

690
00:44:01,090 --> 00:44:01,570
Oh, my God.
(Deity)

691
00:44:01,570 --> 00:44:02,570
(Co-Dean Do Jin-woo)
Oh, my God.

692
00:44:02,610 --> 00:44:04,160
What’s wrong my place?

693
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:05,410
I'm happy with it.

694
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:06,590
Very fashionable.

695
00:44:07,570 --> 00:44:09,700
There are so many memories about that place.

696
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,690
I'm sad too.

697
00:44:12,980 --> 00:44:16,470
But in the end, it’s still Professor Do's position.

698
00:44:18,800 --> 00:44:22,660
Since Professor Do wants to change it,
there is nothing we can do.

699
00:44:22,660 --> 00:44:24,420
In the end,

700
00:44:24,420 --> 00:44:25,640
it's still Professor Do's position.

701
00:44:25,640 --> 00:44:26,950
Do you really think so?

702
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,290
Don't you have a place in your heart for Lord Deity?

703
00:44:30,290 --> 00:44:31,870
Because of your words,

704
00:44:31,870 --> 00:44:35,420
he's the one who will give himself for you.

705
00:44:35,420 --> 00:44:38,460
He was the only one who avenged you.

706
00:44:38,460 --> 00:44:42,110
You didn't just take away a table,

707
00:44:42,110 --> 00:44:44,580
you've removed Lord Deity's place in your heart.

708
00:44:44,580 --> 00:44:46,620
Just

709
00:44:46,620 --> 00:44:49,670
-because of being bewitched by this ghost.
-Nurse Seo,

710
00:44:49,670 --> 00:44:51,750
this is a workplace, a place of work.

711
00:44:51,750 --> 00:44:53,940
Dr. Han and I are your bosses.

712
00:44:53,940 --> 00:44:56,000
I really can't stand to hear you say "honey"
and use disrespectful words.

713
00:44:56,000 --> 00:44:57,020
What should I do?

714
00:44:57,020 --> 00:44:59,840
I've been living for thousands of years
and I've forgotten how to say honorific.

715
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,450
If you can't stand it, fire me.

716
00:45:01,450 --> 00:45:02,900
No need.

717
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:06,100
I resign. Resign.

718
00:45:06,100 --> 00:45:07,910
Wait, wait a minute.

719
00:45:07,910 --> 00:45:08,790
Nurse Seo,

720
00:45:08,790 --> 00:45:11,840
I swear, I don't think like Professor Do.

721
00:45:11,840 --> 00:45:16,490
Honey is such a fashionable and beautiful word.

722
00:45:17,630 --> 00:45:18,990
Just understand.

723
00:45:18,990 --> 00:45:20,680
It's because he's an old American bigot.

724
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:22,950
He doesn't understand the beautiful Korean.

725
00:45:22,950 --> 00:45:26,330
Fine, I'll put up with it for your sake.

726
00:45:26,330 --> 00:45:27,320
But

727
00:45:27,320 --> 00:45:30,100
I really can't stand that face.

728
00:45:30,100 --> 00:45:31,670
I'm going out to cultivate.

729
00:45:31,670 --> 00:45:33,860
Of course, of course.

730
00:45:33,860 --> 00:45:36,220
No patients have come today.

731
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:37,750
Do Jin-woo,

732
00:45:37,750 --> 00:45:39,010
you're the one who did it wrong.

733
00:45:39,010 --> 00:45:40,990
I've decided to drive you out.

734
00:45:40,990 --> 00:45:43,740
I'm going to keep Lord Deity’s position.

735
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:56,290
Please understand.

736
00:45:56,290 --> 00:45:58,760
It's because you've changed so much
that she's scared.

737
00:45:58,760 --> 00:46:00,620
Scared.

738
00:46:00,620 --> 00:46:02,680
When you were Deity,

739
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:06,020
although you two argued sometimes,

740
00:46:07,370 --> 00:46:10,220
your relationship was good.

741
00:46:10,750 --> 00:46:13,620
Is it necessary to keep Nurse Seo?

742
00:46:13,620 --> 00:46:17,630
Look at her attitude towards you and me,
I think she will not treat patients well.

743
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:20,650
In the future, we should develop the hospital.

744
00:46:20,650 --> 00:46:24,200
-I can't be counted on alone.
-It’s said that one uses water will forget the source.

745
00:46:24,200 --> 00:46:27,440
You've really forgotten who you were
when you were Deity.

746
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,400
What are you talking about?

747
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,700
When you were Deity,
no matter how small the hospital is,

748
00:46:32,700 --> 00:46:35,200
or someone is lazy, you didn’t complain.

749
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:36,590
You're a great person,

750
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:40,670
but because you're only satisfied with small things.
I even felt sorry for that.

751
00:46:40,670 --> 00:46:43,790
But now you are... how can I put it?

752
00:46:43,790 --> 00:46:46,380
You're just the professor of Pilseong Hospital.

753
00:46:46,380 --> 00:46:50,960
You're too high up to see the low people, right?

754
00:46:50,960 --> 00:46:54,390
There are times when people are not good enough,

755
00:46:54,390 --> 00:46:57,430
but you can't just fire them
because you're not satisfied.

756
00:46:57,430 --> 00:47:00,760
-It's not like that... -Besides, this table...

757
00:47:00,760 --> 00:47:03,530
Even if you want to change it,
you should tell me and then change it.

758
00:47:03,530 --> 00:47:05,680
You've never been robbed of your desk, right?

759
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:07,880
You've never experienced the sudden discovery that you don't have a work station, right?

760
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:09,990
It happens to me all the time.

761
00:47:09,990 --> 00:47:12,460
So I'm very sensitive about moving tables.

762
00:47:12,460 --> 00:47:14,190
Only after moving can we make up.

763
00:47:16,790 --> 00:47:19,970
Why do you always insist on a position
that doesn't exist anymore?

764
00:47:19,970 --> 00:47:25,280
That’s why you can't see the position to be replaced.

765
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,480
I came back after a long time, after difficulties.

766
00:47:28,610 --> 00:47:31,730
Don't you want to know the value of this place?

767
00:47:39,310 --> 00:47:42,840
Oh damn!

768
00:47:42,840 --> 00:47:44,880
I'm really a martyr.

769
00:47:44,880 --> 00:47:48,910
What is Deity to me? Why am I so angry?

770
00:47:48,910 --> 00:47:50,940
He hasn't got used to it yet.

771
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:54,260
He must be embarrassed.

772
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,340
Damn you, you idiot!

773
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:06,270
Thank you.

774
00:48:10,010 --> 00:48:14,220
-Well... -I don't know what you'd think.

775
00:48:14,220 --> 00:48:17,460
To me, Deity is like Pandora's box.

776
00:48:17,460 --> 00:48:20,170
I don't know what will pop out of that box.

777
00:48:20,170 --> 00:48:22,050
But I always have to face that box.

778
00:48:22,050 --> 00:48:25,770
Actually, I am afraid.

779
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:31,180
So I tried to close the box.

780
00:48:31,180 --> 00:48:33,120
But I made this mess...

781
00:48:33,120 --> 00:48:34,620
I'm sorry.

782
00:48:35,450 --> 00:48:36,760
Oh, don’t say that.

783
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:39,160
I'm more sorry.

784
00:48:39,480 --> 00:48:42,550
I can understand how you feel.

785
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:45,750
The day after I got drunk,
I felt the same way.

786
00:48:45,750 --> 00:48:49,240
My friends suddenly started to be angry with me.

787
00:48:49,240 --> 00:48:52,770
All the puppies in the village
were pooping in front of my house.

788
00:48:52,770 --> 00:48:56,470
I wanted to know what I had done.

789
00:48:56,470 --> 00:49:00,730
But I didn't want to face the reality
that I couldn't even bear.

790
00:49:00,730 --> 00:49:01,900
That’s it.

791
00:49:01,900 --> 00:49:06,920
But why did those puppies treat you like that?

792
00:49:06,920 --> 00:49:09,150
Don't you know that they pee
to take over the territory?

793
00:49:09,150 --> 00:49:11,490
This house is my house,
and this person is my person.

794
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:13,570
Something like that.

795
00:49:13,570 --> 00:49:16,520
That's how puppies behave anyway.

796
00:49:16,520 --> 00:49:18,510
They never act.

797
00:49:19,790 --> 00:49:22,420
Then puppies are really happy.

798
00:49:22,420 --> 00:49:25,930
They don’t need to act,
and occupy a place easily.

799
00:49:25,930 --> 00:49:29,530
Well, is there any place
you want to occupy?

800
00:49:46,650 --> 00:49:50,630
Well... Well, let’s go.

801
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:07,340
I guess my gut doesn’t know
how to act.

802
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:16,900
By the way, have you made up with
Jeong-won?

803
00:50:16,900 --> 00:50:18,820
There’s no such thing.

804
00:50:18,820 --> 00:50:23,180
We already broke up,
but I can’t remember.

805
00:50:24,850 --> 00:50:27,710
I don’t know if you broke up,

806
00:50:27,710 --> 00:50:31,320
but I can see that she still has
feelings for you.

807
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:34,150
Maybe there’s a trace.

808
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:38,170
Wherever you stay, you leave a trace.

809
00:50:38,170 --> 00:50:42,320
But we can’t say that the bus is still there

810
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:45,860
just because of the trace left by the bus.

811
00:50:45,860 --> 00:50:48,580
I think the same is true of
the human heart.

812
00:50:50,750 --> 00:50:54,370
I didn’t get to know you before.

813
00:50:54,370 --> 00:50:59,040
It turns out you’re really
philosophical.

814
00:50:59,040 --> 00:51:01,350
I wanted to study medical ethics

815
00:51:01,350 --> 00:51:04,130
because it’s based on the
humanistic philosophy.

816
00:51:04,130 --> 00:51:05,960
I see.

817
00:51:14,710 --> 00:51:17,820
(The Dragon King's steaky pork)

818
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:20,040
Can we go to another restaurant?

819
00:51:20,040 --> 00:51:21,200
Why?

820
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:23,400
Don’t you love the pork here?

821
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,630
Because the smell is so...

822
00:51:26,630 --> 00:51:28,900
What’s the smell?

823
00:51:28,900 --> 00:51:31,430
How dare you complain the smell

824
00:51:31,430 --> 00:51:32,970
at my place of business!

825
00:51:32,970 --> 00:51:34,080
No...

826
00:51:34,080 --> 00:51:38,410
People are ungrateful.
I’ve told you so many times.

827
00:51:38,410 --> 00:51:43,530
You’ve been so nice to him.
Is this what we want to see?

828
00:51:43,530 --> 00:51:47,770
Well, it’s a misunderstanding.

829
00:51:47,770 --> 00:51:52,570
Professor Do has recently
suffered from enteritis,
and had vomiting and diarrhea.

830
00:51:52,570 --> 00:51:53,810
That’s so terrible.

831
00:51:53,810 --> 00:51:55,600
Terrible?

832
00:51:56,340 --> 00:51:58,030
That’s good.

833
00:51:58,030 --> 00:52:03,380
I think Mr. Johns is really
terrible on the inside.

834
00:52:03,380 --> 00:52:05,650
I was uncomfortable, and tried to
consult him.

835
00:52:05,650 --> 00:52:08,840
But he said something
about the jade floor.

836
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,720
And ancestor gods. Ancestor gods.

837
00:52:10,720 --> 00:52:14,400
Right. Jade floor and ancestor gods.

838
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:16,520
I believe in only one religion.

839
00:52:16,520 --> 00:52:18,780
Do I look like a person
preaching a cult?

840
00:52:18,780 --> 00:52:21,670
You’re despising my poor life, right?

841
00:52:21,670 --> 00:52:24,970
Mr. Johns.

842
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:28,900
I’ve told you the jade floor and
ancestor gods had nothing
to do with me.

843
00:52:28,900 --> 00:52:33,150
Ahh, ahh..

844
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:34,770
Ahh, ahh? Do you want to say
iced Americano?
(Note: The pronunciation of "ahh" here is similar to the abbreviation of iced Americano, which is a homophonic joke.)

845
00:52:34,770 --> 00:52:37,010
Is this a place for you to ask for coffee?

846
00:52:37,010 --> 00:52:39,650
Is that all you want to tell me?

847
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:44,140
-No, this... -You two, don’t even
think about doing business
in Yeongpo.

848
00:52:44,140 --> 00:52:46,250
Don’t underestimate me

849
00:52:46,250 --> 00:52:49,860
just because I’m too kind.

850
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,180
You’re really wrong!

851
00:52:51,180 --> 00:52:55,780
Yeah, my husband can be
aggressive when he’s heartless!

852
00:52:55,780 --> 00:52:57,910
Well, well.

853
00:52:57,910 --> 00:53:01,770
Sis, what exactly is wrong with you?

854
00:53:01,770 --> 00:53:03,690
My shoulders are stiff and my legs hurt.

855
00:53:03,690 --> 00:53:05,520
That’s what happens when we’re old.

856
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,010
Well.

857
00:53:07,010 --> 00:53:10,490
Why don’t you come inside
and let me examine you?

858
00:53:10,490 --> 00:53:13,210
I mean, can you do that only with a
stethoscope?

859
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:14,930
Don’t you have to draw some blood,
take a urine test or something?

860
00:53:14,930 --> 00:53:16,940
It should be more formal, right?

861
00:53:16,940 --> 00:53:20,830
Well, you want to go to the hospital?

862
00:53:20,830 --> 00:53:23,070
Then come to the hospital later.
I’ll examine you...

863
00:53:23,070 --> 00:53:24,730
No.

864
00:53:24,730 --> 00:53:25,830
What?

865
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:30,290
Behave yourself, okay?

866
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:34,810
Blood and urine tests are not
enough for the old.

867
00:53:34,810 --> 00:53:37,380
You need to take an X-ray,
and an ultrasound scan.

868
00:53:37,380 --> 00:53:39,400
I think you’re really an American.

869
00:53:39,400 --> 00:53:41,660
Capitalism has seeped into your bone.

870
00:53:41,660 --> 00:53:43,830
Do you think we’re silly?

871
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,050
How much would that cost?

872
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:48,880
I’ll make it free for you.

873
00:53:49,530 --> 00:53:51,450
-Free? -Free?

874
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:56,630
Mr. Johns, really?

875
00:53:56,630 --> 00:53:58,390
Yes.

876
00:53:58,390 --> 00:54:01,120
Why are you doing this all of a sudden?

877
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:02,880
I can’t even please you,

878
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,580
so I don’t want to make things
difficult for you.

879
00:54:06,580 --> 00:54:09,170
Come to the hospital when you have time.

880
00:54:09,170 --> 00:54:10,560
I’ll help examine you.

881
00:54:10,560 --> 00:54:12,670
Okay, okay.

882
00:54:12,670 --> 00:54:14,430
Well, really good.

883
00:54:21,160 --> 00:54:22,960
Press on it.

884
00:54:29,060 --> 00:54:31,220
Well, I don’t need to go through this.

885
00:54:31,220 --> 00:54:34,540
Boss, I’ll leave first.

886
00:54:34,830 --> 00:54:38,130
You want me to be a bad boss?
Get tested, too.

887
00:54:38,130 --> 00:54:39,090
Working with me, you’ll know
sooner or later

888
00:54:39,090 --> 00:54:41,470
that the boss and the employees
are the same.

889
00:54:41,470 --> 00:54:43,960
If an employee gets sick,
the boss will get a headache.

890
00:54:43,960 --> 00:54:46,480
Yeah, you should also get tested.

891
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:48,490
Anyway it’s free.

892
00:54:48,490 --> 00:54:50,650
Enjoy it.

893
00:54:52,460 --> 00:54:54,060
Come on.

894
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:01,480
Press on it.

895
00:55:02,250 --> 00:55:03,680
Yes, yes.

896
00:55:03,680 --> 00:55:07,230
The results will come out later tomorrow.

897
00:55:07,230 --> 00:55:10,270
So come here to get the results
two days later.

898
00:55:10,270 --> 00:55:11,560
That’s really quick.

899
00:55:11,560 --> 00:55:13,920
It’s good.

900
00:55:13,920 --> 00:55:16,780
I can take all the results, right?

901
00:55:16,780 --> 00:55:18,230
Of course.

902
00:55:27,450 --> 00:55:32,600
You’re not comfortable here.
You should go to the chairman’s house.

903
00:55:32,600 --> 00:55:34,890
I should live with people.

904
00:55:34,890 --> 00:55:36,840
I found a business apartment
in the city.

905
00:55:36,840 --> 00:55:39,010
I just have to make do tonight.

906
00:55:39,010 --> 00:55:43,220
I knew the chairman is not a human.

907
00:55:43,220 --> 00:55:45,920
It’s really scientific to judge from
the appearance.

908
00:55:47,540 --> 00:55:50,010
They bullied you, right?

909
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,960
They didn’t call you
when they ate and talked in French.

910
00:55:52,960 --> 00:55:56,290
And they threatened you to give up
the stock, right?

911
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:59,260
How do you know that?

912
00:55:59,260 --> 00:56:01,480
Of course I learned it from the drama.

913
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,270
Well... Do you believe all that?

914
00:56:04,270 --> 00:56:07,470
The scriptwriters are very serious
about finding information.

915
00:56:07,470 --> 00:56:09,710
Would they make up something?

916
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,620
What?

917
00:56:15,030 --> 00:56:18,240
Are you making fun of me
for believing that?

918
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:20,270
No.

919
00:56:20,270 --> 00:56:21,930
Very interesting.

920
00:56:33,030 --> 00:56:35,790
I’ve never found

921
00:56:35,790 --> 00:56:38,080
people so interesting before,

922
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,410
and the world so interesting.

923
00:56:43,330 --> 00:56:45,450
I want to live longer.

924
00:56:47,660 --> 00:56:51,320
This guy is playing me now.

925
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,420
What the hell do you guys do?

926
00:56:56,420 --> 00:56:59,460
You bragged about your
blood vessels being used
for 1,400 years.

927
00:56:59,460 --> 00:57:01,170
Did they get clogged up so soon?

928
00:57:01,170 --> 00:57:02,610
The blood doesn’t flow
and the brain doesn’t work.

929
00:57:02,610 --> 00:57:04,910
Why not take this opportunity
to make you gasp for breath?

930
00:57:04,910 --> 00:57:08,670
Who would have thought
this guy had a thousand-year-old
python inside him?

931
00:57:08,670 --> 00:57:11,970
Ah, you’ve just figured out his identity.

932
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:15,710
No more time. What can we do
knowing his identity now?

933
00:57:15,710 --> 00:57:19,690
Lord Deity, I’ll kill Do Jin-woo
with my own hands.

934
00:57:19,690 --> 00:57:22,750
Gak Shin, you’ll die anyway.

935
00:57:22,750 --> 00:57:26,100
Even if you don’t do that,
he’ll also die in a few days.

936
00:57:26,100 --> 00:57:31,670
No... I’m asking you to save him.

937
00:57:31,670 --> 00:57:33,130
But you’re thinking about killing him.

938
00:57:33,130 --> 00:57:35,550
How can the wrong order
be implemented smoothly?

939
00:57:37,130 --> 00:57:40,200
Wait! What’s going on?

940
00:57:45,400 --> 00:57:49,150
Dr. Han, are you inside?

941
00:58:01,060 --> 00:58:03,050
Who are you?

942
00:58:03,050 --> 00:58:07,680
Are you... Are you Professor Do?

943
00:58:17,270 --> 00:58:19,270
Professor Do!

944
00:58:19,270 --> 00:58:23,080
-Finally I meet you. -Bak Chung-seong.

945
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,990
Why are you here?

946
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:28,120
Do you know how hard I’ve
been looking for you these days?

947
00:58:28,120 --> 00:58:30,840
Looking for me? Why?

948
00:58:30,840 --> 00:58:34,970
What the hell is that list?

949
00:58:34,970 --> 00:58:35,910
List?

950
00:58:35,910 --> 00:58:39,540
The list of falsified medical tests
of Pilseong Hospital I gave you.

951
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:50,140
-I don’t know. -What?

952
00:58:50,140 --> 00:58:53,130
You said you had known,

953
00:58:53,130 --> 00:58:56,210
and would submit it as evidence in court.

954
00:58:56,210 --> 00:58:58,290
It’s wrong.

955
00:58:58,290 --> 00:59:02,610
I thought it was a medical
malpractice list. But it’s not.

956
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:09,340
What’s the matter with you?

957
00:59:09,340 --> 00:59:12,700
Are you threatened by Pilseong?

958
00:59:12,700 --> 00:59:15,240
Your accident was not an ordinary accident.

959
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:17,640
It was designed by Kim Pil-soo.

960
00:59:29,170 --> 00:59:31,410
No.

961
00:59:31,410 --> 00:59:35,750
I was probably overdosing
on my depression medicine.

962
00:59:35,750 --> 00:59:39,310
It has nothing to do with
Pilseong Hospital nor Kim Pil-soo.

963
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:46,700
No, no. That’s absolutely impossible.

964
00:59:48,450 --> 00:59:49,670
I...

965
00:59:50,920 --> 00:59:55,620
Do you know what I did for you?

966
00:59:55,620 --> 00:59:57,510
I thought Kim Pil-soo killed you.

967
00:59:57,510 --> 00:59:58,930
I was worried he would
do the same to me,

968
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:02,240
and my family would be in danger.

969
01:00:02,240 --> 01:00:05,540
So I’ve been playing dead and hiding.

970
01:00:05,540 --> 01:00:06,660
I’m sorry.

971
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,850
I didn’t know it would turn out like this.

972
01:00:12,280 --> 01:00:15,270
You can go back now.

973
01:00:16,560 --> 01:00:18,130
Go back?

974
01:00:19,190 --> 01:00:20,630
Where?

975
01:00:21,430 --> 01:00:22,630
Go home?

976
01:00:24,700 --> 01:00:31,270
Ji-min believes his father was a
righteous man saving children
from death.

977
01:00:31,270 --> 01:00:34,740
If I’m back, I’ll become a fraud.

978
01:00:34,740 --> 01:00:40,480
Even if dad’s a fraud,
it’s better to have no dad.

979
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:46,680
Then what about the list?

980
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:49,230
Am I supposed to live like
I don’t know about the list?

981
01:00:51,970 --> 01:00:55,440
What does that matter?

982
01:00:55,440 --> 01:00:58,490
Anyway, living is the most important thing.

983
01:00:58,490 --> 01:01:01,450
So...

984
01:01:09,390 --> 01:01:10,410
What do you mean?

985
01:01:10,410 --> 01:01:13,080
How can Bak Chung-seong disappear?

986
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:15,540
Yesterday he said he would meet
you and Professor Do at the hospital.

987
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:18,230
Me? I didn’t see him.

988
01:01:18,230 --> 01:01:19,930
He never came back after that.

989
01:01:19,930 --> 01:01:21,970
Calls? Did he call?

990
01:01:24,010 --> 01:01:24,590
(Brother, where are you? Are you okay?
I'm worried about you. Contact me when you see the message.)

991
01:01:24,590 --> 01:01:25,800
Brother, where are you?
(Brother, where are you? Are you okay?
I'm worried about you. Contact me when you see the message.)

992
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,440
Brother, where are you?

993
01:01:26,440 --> 01:01:28,280
Are you okay?

994
01:01:28,280 --> 01:01:29,710
I’m very worried about you.

995
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:30,540
Contact me if you see the messages.

996
01:01:30,540 --> 01:01:31,140
(I've been bothering you for a long time. I'll take care of it myself from now on.
Don't worry too much. I'm sorry.)
Contact me if you see the messages.

997
01:01:31,140 --> 01:01:33,180
Thank you for taking care of me.
(I've been bothering you for a long time. I'll take care of it myself from now on.
Don't worry too much. I'm sorry.)

998
01:01:33,180 --> 01:01:36,810
I’ll take care of myself in the future. Don’t worry about me.

999
01:01:36,810 --> 01:01:38,250
I’m sorry.

1000
01:01:40,070 --> 01:01:43,460
He must have been so devastated
that he needs time to think.

1001
01:01:43,460 --> 01:01:45,340
He’ll be home soon.

1002
01:01:45,340 --> 01:01:48,190
What if he gets too devastate
and has bad thoughts?

1003
01:01:48,190 --> 01:01:51,300
Or maybe he knows something.

1004
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:53,960
Pilseong Hospital did something
to silence him.

1005
01:01:53,960 --> 01:01:57,080
You’re quite imaginative.

1006
01:01:57,080 --> 01:01:59,030
That’s not right.

1007
01:01:59,030 --> 01:02:01,870
Help find Bak Chung-seong.

1008
01:02:01,870 --> 01:02:03,040
Me?

1009
01:02:03,040 --> 01:02:06,700
How am I supposed to find
someone who's determined to hide?

1010
01:02:06,700 --> 01:02:10,460
Well, not you, Professor Do.

1011
01:02:10,460 --> 01:02:12,380
I mean Bulhwa Company.

1012
01:02:12,380 --> 01:02:15,700
It took 2 hours for Deity

1013
01:02:15,700 --> 01:02:17,910
to find Bak Chung-seong.

1014
01:02:17,910 --> 01:02:21,060
Rich men are omnipotent.

1015
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:22,660
I can’t.

1016
01:02:24,220 --> 01:02:28,280
Maybe Deity can do that, but I can’t.

1017
01:02:28,280 --> 01:02:29,560
Because I’m a human being.

1018
01:02:30,900 --> 01:02:34,010
Deity is quite close to Bulhwa Company.

1019
01:02:34,010 --> 01:02:37,300
But you’re not. Professor Do,
is that what you mean?

1020
01:02:37,300 --> 01:02:40,880
You don’t want to be involved with
those who don’t look like people.

1021
01:02:42,950 --> 01:02:49,040
I’m just doing this out of fear.
Can you help me?

1022
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,100
Because Bak Chung-seong is missing,

1023
01:02:51,100 --> 01:02:54,870
I think that’s also the reason for
my accident before.

1024
01:02:54,870 --> 01:02:56,590
What accident?

1025
01:02:56,590 --> 01:02:58,690
Don’t you remember?

1026
01:02:58,690 --> 01:03:01,670
I was almost killed by a person
not long ago.

1027
01:03:01,670 --> 01:03:04,540
The police said it might have been
a bludger in the neighbourhood.

1028
01:03:04,540 --> 01:03:06,100
But who knows?

1029
01:03:06,100 --> 01:03:08,510
Maybe it was Kim Pil-soo’s man.

1030
01:03:09,920 --> 01:03:12,570
Why did Kim Pil-soo want to hurt you?

1031
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:17,810
Could you close your eyes
and help find this man?

1032
01:03:19,160 --> 01:03:21,270
I’m sorry.

1033
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:28,950
Professor Do, I can fully
understand your feelings.

1034
01:03:30,110 --> 01:03:33,160
But a man’s life is at stake.

1035
01:03:34,550 --> 01:03:36,420
For you,

1036
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:39,880
is self-esteem more important
than life?

1037
01:03:43,930 --> 01:03:45,820
Could you?

1038
01:03:45,820 --> 01:03:48,470
Look, there’s something
really wrong with her.

1039
01:03:48,470 --> 01:03:51,580
Is that all she can do?

1040
01:03:51,580 --> 01:03:53,840
Hurry over and put it on Han Gye-jeol.

1041
01:03:53,840 --> 01:03:55,090
Yeah, of course she has to put it on.

1042
01:03:55,090 --> 01:03:57,460
The silver bracelet and
the silver handcuffs.

1043
01:03:57,460 --> 01:04:00,280
Such substandard skill should be brought to justice.

1044
01:04:00,280 --> 01:04:01,990
Silver bracelet? If you don’t
understand, you should ask.

1045
01:04:01,990 --> 01:04:03,590
You’re stupid.

1046
01:04:03,590 --> 01:04:06,150
I’m asking you to put a smartwatch
on her. Smartwatch!

1047
01:04:06,150 --> 01:04:07,250
Smartwatch?

1048
01:04:07,250 --> 01:04:08,120
What?

1049
01:04:08,120 --> 01:04:10,630
You said the Allstar Watch was a
proud product of Bulhwa Company.

1050
01:04:10,630 --> 01:04:13,220
What's wrong?
Is the performance not so good?

1051
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:15,720
It seems Pilseung Electronics
products are more reliable.

1052
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,350
Well.

1053
01:04:17,350 --> 01:04:23,580
Speaking of electronic products,
it should be Bulhwa Electronics.

1054
01:04:23,580 --> 01:04:26,970
But why put this on Han Gye-jeol?

1055
01:04:28,510 --> 01:04:30,070
She said she was afraid.

1056
01:04:30,070 --> 01:04:32,150
With that on, she might feel better.

1057
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:36,710
You scared me!

1058
01:04:36,710 --> 01:04:37,750
What? What’s wrong?

1059
01:04:37,750 --> 01:04:39,480
Why do you look like
you can’t breathe again?

1060
01:04:39,480 --> 01:04:41,020
-That... That’s it. -What?

1061
01:04:41,020 --> 01:04:42,210
Smartwatch.

1062
01:04:42,210 --> 01:04:44,770
What are you talking about? Be clear.

1063
01:04:44,770 --> 01:04:47,460
Smartwatch... Can it set a code word?

1064
01:04:47,460 --> 01:04:49,920
Of course. Speaking of this,

1065
01:04:49,920 --> 01:04:51,800
in an emergency, shouting the
code word

1066
01:04:51,800 --> 01:04:52,660
can send out distress signals.

1067
01:04:53,580 --> 01:04:54,660
Then set the code word as

1068
01:04:54,850 --> 01:04:57,420
“Deity, come back!”

1069
01:04:57,640 --> 01:04:59,490
Is this okay?

1070
01:05:00,730 --> 01:05:02,690
Anyway, you mean

1071
01:05:02,690 --> 01:05:05,450
put it on Han Gye-jeol and create
another dangerous situation.

1072
01:05:05,450 --> 01:05:06,240
-Yes. -For example,

1073
01:05:06,240 --> 01:05:08,540
if the bullies in the neighbourhood
dare to go near Han Gye-jeol,

1074
01:05:08,540 --> 01:05:11,320
she can shout, “Deity, come back!”

1075
01:05:11,320 --> 01:05:14,230
And then Lord Deity can appear
suddenly

1076
01:05:14,230 --> 01:05:17,890
in front of Han Gye-jeol.

1077
01:05:17,890 --> 01:05:20,180
Wow, you’re really...

1078
01:05:22,320 --> 01:05:23,350
Listen,

1079
01:05:23,350 --> 01:05:25,200
what do you think of Do Jin-woo?

1080
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,480
Is he still competent, gentle and
handsome?

1081
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:29,760
When you met him again this time,

1082
01:05:29,760 --> 01:05:31,130
is he still who you think he is?

1083
01:05:32,740 --> 01:05:37,780
How can a person be exactly
like the image in the mind?

1084
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:40,720
What’s wrong? You seem disappointed.

1085
01:05:40,720 --> 01:05:42,020
-No. -It’s fine.

1086
01:05:42,020 --> 01:05:43,790
Just think of me as your sister and
speak your mind.

1087
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:45,960
I’m a very tight-lipped person.

1088
01:05:47,670 --> 01:05:52,000
Deity once told me that

1089
01:05:52,000 --> 01:05:54,420
what I see is real

1090
01:05:54,420 --> 01:05:57,680
and what I want to see is not.

1091
01:05:57,680 --> 01:06:01,440
Please look at the real one
in front of you.

1092
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:04,410
But something seems to be wrong with me.

1093
01:06:04,410 --> 01:06:06,270
I always want to find the one
out of my sight.

1094
01:06:06,270 --> 01:06:06,640
(Seung-sik Fire Station, Our supermarket
(Haesui Crossroads Yeongpo Nursing Home Haesi Elementary School)
I always want to find the one
out of my sight.

1095
01:06:06,640 --> 01:06:09,620
Why beat around the bush?
You seem to miss Deity.
(Seung-sik Fire Station, Our supermarket
(Haesui Crossroads Yeongpo Nursing Home Haesi Elementary School)

1096
01:06:09,620 --> 01:06:10,370
Why beat around the bush?
You seem to miss Deity.

1097
01:06:10,370 --> 01:06:12,700
If you miss him, just say it.

1098
01:06:12,700 --> 01:06:15,820
You only need to say “Deity,
come back”. That’s simple.

1099
01:06:15,820 --> 01:06:16,800
No.

1100
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,160
Why not? What’s wrong?

1101
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:22,800
To say that is to make Professor Do
a different person.

1102
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:25,080
If it were you and someone
said that to you,

1103
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:25,980
would you like to hear it?

1104
01:06:25,980 --> 01:06:27,200
I’ll feel happy.

1105
01:06:27,200 --> 01:06:28,540
-Happy? -Yes.

1106
01:06:28,540 --> 01:06:29,870
I think a person who speaks his mind like that

1107
01:06:29,870 --> 01:06:31,970
is very cute. And I like that.

1108
01:06:31,970 --> 01:06:34,290
So I also want to say I really miss Deity.

1109
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:35,790
Otherwise why did I set the code word as

1110
01:06:35,790 --> 01:06:39,310
“Deity, come back!”

1111
01:06:39,310 --> 01:06:40,150
Oh my god.

1112
01:06:42,130 --> 01:06:43,280
Is this expensive?

1113
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:44,400
A little bit anyway.

1114
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,730
But it’s not worth more than my life.

1115
01:06:46,730 --> 01:06:48,440
Life?

1116
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:49,850
Haven’t you heard of that

1117
01:06:49,850 --> 01:06:52,390
there are a lot of hooligans
in our neighborhood recently?

1118
01:06:52,390 --> 01:06:53,910
Hooligans?

1119
01:06:53,910 --> 01:06:56,330
The kind of people who
do bad things to women?

1120
01:06:56,330 --> 01:06:58,750
Yes. Isn’t it horrible?

1121
01:06:58,750 --> 01:07:01,480
Well, I heard you almost had a big accident.

1122
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:02,320
Yeah.

1123
01:07:02,320 --> 01:07:04,720
Oh my god. How’s your
neighborhood? Is it safe now?

1124
01:07:04,720 --> 01:07:06,140
Are there many street lights?

1125
01:07:06,140 --> 01:07:08,800
Oh, well, you live by yourself.

1126
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:11,290
I have a brother,

1127
01:07:11,290 --> 01:07:13,470
but he doesn’t come back recently.

1128
01:07:13,470 --> 01:07:15,220
Yeah, so what if there were ten of them.

1129
01:07:15,220 --> 01:07:17,630
They’re no better than this watch.

1130
01:07:18,940 --> 01:07:21,510
I really envy you.

1131
01:07:21,510 --> 01:07:23,880
I can lend it to you.

1132
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,790
Is that okay?

1133
01:07:27,800 --> 01:07:30,760
No, thanks. You must also be scared.

1134
01:07:30,760 --> 01:07:34,860
No. I get a lot of people
picking me up every night.

1135
01:07:34,860 --> 01:07:37,240
Come on. Put your arm out.

1136
01:07:37,240 --> 01:07:38,420
Really?

1137
01:07:39,920 --> 01:07:43,760
Listen, you should know that
you’re lucky to meet me.

1138
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:45,360
That means you’re really lucky.

1139
01:07:45,360 --> 01:07:46,730
I don't think there's a sister like me.

1140
01:07:46,730 --> 01:07:49,440
Come on. It’s yours.

1141
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:52,250
Thanks, sister.

1142
01:07:52,250 --> 01:07:55,060
By the way, what’s the code word?

1143
01:07:55,060 --> 01:07:58,070
Deity, come back!

1144
01:08:02,650 --> 01:08:04,930
You just parted from Han Gye-jeol, right?

1145
01:08:04,930 --> 01:08:07,590
Yes. I offered to stay at the hospital
and clean up.

1146
01:08:07,590 --> 01:08:09,570
So she went home directly.

1147
01:08:09,570 --> 01:08:11,840
She’ll be back soon. Do it well.

1148
01:08:11,840 --> 01:08:14,470
Of course I’ll. Don’t worry.
It’s a piece of cake.

1149
01:08:15,810 --> 01:08:17,840
Guys, are you ready?

1150
01:08:17,840 --> 01:08:20,620
Hey, are you guys here to box?

1151
01:08:20,620 --> 01:08:21,689
Can you pretend to be hooligans?

1152
01:08:21,689 --> 01:08:23,920
Spread your legs and spit.

1153
01:08:58,550 --> 01:09:00,340
Has the plan changed?

1154
01:09:00,340 --> 01:09:04,029
These people should have let me
know if the plans had changed.

1155
01:09:09,930 --> 01:09:11,210
What’s the matter?

1156
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:17,819
What’s the guy doing?

1157
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,020
No.

1158
01:10:02,930 --> 01:10:04,470
Han Gye-jeol, no!

1159
01:10:07,200 --> 01:10:08,950
Han Gye-jeol, go out!

1160
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:10,460
Get out! Han Gye-jeol!

1161
01:10:10,460 --> 01:10:11,580
Get out!

1162
01:10:27,490 --> 01:10:29,680
Han Gye-jeol!

1163
01:10:37,340 --> 01:10:38,600
Call me quickly!

1164
01:10:38,600 --> 01:10:40,530
Please call me!

1165
01:10:46,370 --> 01:10:47,500
Han Gye-jeol!

1166
01:11:11,340 --> 01:11:15,300
(Next episode preview)

1167
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,360
Are you upset because it’s me?

1168
01:11:16,360 --> 01:11:16,480
(Thanks to special appearance of Jeong A-mi.)
Are you upset because it’s me?

1169
01:11:16,480 --> 01:11:17,770
Actually, Professor, you don’t like me.
(Thanks to special appearance of Jeong A-mi.)

1170
01:11:17,770 --> 01:11:18,880
Actually, Professor, you don’t like me.

1171
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,850
Dr. Han, Deity is a virtual image after all.

1172
01:11:21,850 --> 01:11:24,440
Please help me. Let me continue to
live as Do Jin-woo.

1173
01:11:24,440 --> 01:11:26,600
I’ll think about it.

1174
01:11:26,600 --> 01:11:27,560
Are you going to kill him?

1175
01:11:27,560 --> 01:11:29,390
God has set aside a day for you.

1176
01:11:29,390 --> 01:11:30,320
Dr. Han.

1177
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:32,470
Don’t you want to help me?

1178
01:11:32,470 --> 01:11:34,920
I mean, I’m not qualified to help you.

1179
01:11:34,920 --> 01:11:37,830
Deity, come back!

1180
01:11:39,130 --> 01:11:42,390
Are you really Deity?

1181
01:11:42,390 --> 01:11:44,120
I thought I’d never see you again.
