1
00:00:27,790 --> 00:00:29,230
(Episode 1)

2
00:01:17,020 --> 00:01:20,300
The day the whole family rejoiced

3
00:01:25,230 --> 00:01:27,130
Was my funeral.

4
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:33,920
In order to kill me.

5
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:36,300
My love

6
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:38,670
Slowly approaches

7
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,390
From afar.

8
00:01:46,870 --> 00:01:50,880
You’re almost ready to go when ready.

9
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,380
Beautiful?

10
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:02,660
I was waiting for putting on beautiful clothes,

11
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:05,440
For stepping on the beautiful road,

12
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,840
For spending the rest days with the beloved you.

13
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:12,540
But I never dreamed of

14
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:20,380
That day I’ll be sold on my lover’s hands.

15
00:02:20,590 --> 00:02:22,579
You’re going to a grand occasion.

16
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:24,700
Why did you describe it as being sold?

17
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,120
What about a place to die?

18
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,710
Any place without my love

19
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:35,860
Is all a grave to me.

20
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:51,400
You said that heather flowers bloom in both the world and the underworld, right?

21
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:54,940
I wish to bloom with you, alive or dead,

22
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,840
But not for the rest of my life.

23
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:02,080
Get it back.

24
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:46,540
Tonight, the palanquin procession will stop in the mountains near Jeol Dong.

25
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,300
Please hide in the cave.

26
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:49,670
I’ll pick you up.

27
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:53,620
Have you forgotten where I’m going?

28
00:03:53,620 --> 00:03:54,700
If I disappear,

29
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:57,390
Both our families will be finished.

30
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:00,980
The country will break up, causing a bloodbath.

31
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,290
Let those who are responsible for the country worry about its affairs.

32
00:04:05,290 --> 00:04:08,540
Let us just worry about our business.

33
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:11,400
And

34
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:15,680
This ring

35
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:19,380
Will be returned to you certainly.

36
00:05:46,580 --> 00:05:47,970
O Hyeon

37
00:05:49,510 --> 00:05:50,640
O Hyeon

38
00:05:52,130 --> 00:05:53,420
Let me go!

39
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:54,659
Seol Hui

40
00:05:58,570 --> 00:06:00,110
Don’t!

41
00:06:17,750 --> 00:06:20,680
O Hyeon, don’t!

42
00:06:22,060 --> 00:06:24,520
The falling arrows took place of the sun.

43
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:28,890
My beloved’s morning loses all its light.

44
00:06:28,890 --> 00:06:32,010
O Hyeon

45
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:37,600
O Hyeon

46
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:46,750
And thus his war was over.

47
00:06:55,780 --> 00:06:58,180
My war

48
00:06:58,520 --> 00:07:00,310
Then began.

49
00:07:45,510 --> 00:07:48,590
You who took the morning from my beloved

50
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:53,540
Won’t see the mornings either.

51
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:26,420
(Eonju Hospital)

52
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:28,390
(Han Gye-jeol)

53
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:34,000
And then what?

54
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,549
What’s the end?

55
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:36,710
What else?

56
00:08:36,710 --> 00:08:38,000
Died.

57
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,890
Is that the end?

58
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,750
The ending?

59
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:42,260
What kind of ending did you expect?

60
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,160
Somewhat uncomfortable without a happy ending.

61
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,950
Dozens of people have died because of those two young people

62
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:51,960
How could there be a happy ending?

63
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:57,620
In the eyes of a God who thinks everything on earth is as good as his own children,

64
00:08:57,620 --> 00:09:02,600
Those two young people are nothing but sinners.

65
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:05,520
They should have been punished.

66
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:08,460
They have been punished heavily.

67
00:09:08,460 --> 00:09:11,780
The tribute girl lost her beloved,

68
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:16,700
and repeatedly suicide in the world.

69
00:09:16,700 --> 00:09:19,530
The samurai is bound forever to the path of the underworld.

70
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,390
He became a Deity.

71
00:09:21,390 --> 00:09:28,440
It was their punishment to never see each other again.

72
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:29,430
What’s wrong?

73
00:09:29,430 --> 00:09:32,380
Something goes wrong with the story?

74
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:33,780
What’s a Deity?

75
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:36,980
Well, how don’t you know what a Deity is?

76
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:43,520
Well, I’m a good doctor, but a little weak in humanities.

77
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:49,000
When people die, the road to the underworld will appear.

78
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,390
But they have no idea where they’re going

79
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:54,830
Because it’s the first time they die.

80
00:09:54,830 --> 00:09:57,760
At this time, it is the Deity that

81
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:02,300
leads the wandering dead to the right path.

82
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,520
Is that the kind of unusual ghost?

83
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:09,250
Honestly? How can you compare a Deity with such a vulgar thing?

84
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:11,280
There are no such things in the underworld.

85
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,440
There’s only Deity

86
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,350
Is Deity handsome?

87
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:17,760
Why do you mention looks?

88
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,510
Well...if it’s what you said,

89
00:10:19,510 --> 00:10:22,060
I’ll see him once I go to the underworld.

90
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:26,040
Wouldn’t it be better if he looks handsome?

91
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,840
If he is handsome, are you planning to seduce him into a relationship?

92
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:31,750
Good idea.

93
00:10:31,750 --> 00:10:34,270
What the hell?

94
00:10:34,270 --> 00:10:37,980
I don’t care if he’s a king or a god, he’s a great man.

95
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:42,900
If that Deity could become my lover,
What a powerful backer he would be!

96
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:43,790
What?

97
00:10:43,790 --> 00:10:45,730
A backer?

98
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:49,570
Where are you going?

99
00:10:52,590 --> 00:10:52,860
(Eonju Hospital)

100
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:54,180
What did I say?
(Eonju Hospital)

101
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:58,700
You must have someone behind you to keep you here.

102
00:10:58,700 --> 00:10:59,910
Just a murderer.

103
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:01,440
What murderer?

104
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,900
You’re going too far.

105
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,800
Too far?

106
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,460
How could you say that after you killed my father?

107
00:11:06,460 --> 00:11:08,750
No... how can you be such a shameless woman?

108
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:11,970
Actually, I made it clear at that time.

109
00:11:11,970 --> 00:11:13,580
Although there was nothing on the surface,

110
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:17,030
It would be dangerous if the patient pressed on the spinal cord when his neck was fractured.

111
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:20,960
Never move the patient.
So I told you to do the surgery here.

112
00:11:20,960 --> 00:11:23,150
Even so, you took the patient to Seoul...

113
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:24,940
Look, look!

114
00:11:24,940 --> 00:11:27,650
Do you still think it’s my fault?

115
00:11:27,650 --> 00:11:28,150
You are nothing but “One Season”!
(Note: In Korean, “Han” is a homophone for “one”)

116
00:11:28,150 --> 00:11:30,420
You are nothing but “One Season”!

117
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:32,200
I heard you graduated from Yeonri University.

118
00:11:32,200 --> 00:11:35,490
Why should I trust a doctor from such an inferior university like you

119
00:11:35,490 --> 00:11:38,010
To operate on my father in a hospital like this?

120
00:11:38,010 --> 00:11:40,660
I tried my best to stop you.

121
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:43,480
I even begged you on my knees. Don’t you remember?

122
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,840
I even stopped the ambulance.

123
00:11:44,840 --> 00:11:46,170
You should have tried harder to stop me.

124
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,970
Even if you had to run in front of the car,

125
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:51,020
Even if it costs you your soul!

126
00:11:51,020 --> 00:11:52,310
As a doctor,

127
00:11:52,310 --> 00:11:55,500
How could you do nothing knowing the patient was in danger?

128
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:58,060
Was this what your school taught you?

129
00:11:58,060 --> 00:12:01,420
So you even sued, right?

130
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:03,290
I have nothing more to say.

131
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:05,650
Just follow the law.

132
00:12:05,650 --> 00:12:06,770
The law?

133
00:12:06,770 --> 00:12:09,050
You’re really...

134
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,130
My hand...

135
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,110
Won’t you let go?

136
00:12:13,110 --> 00:12:14,040
Let go!

137
00:12:14,040 --> 00:12:15,670
How can you be so reckless?

138
00:12:15,670 --> 00:12:17,210
Who’s your backer?

139
00:12:17,210 --> 00:12:20,730
I am my backer. What’s wrong?

140
00:12:22,490 --> 00:12:24,450
Did you hit me with a bottle ten days ago?

141
00:12:24,450 --> 00:12:26,200
Did you scratch me five days ago?

142
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:28,450
Did you spill coffee on me three days ago?

143
00:12:28,450 --> 00:12:32,540
I have as much evidence on me as I need.

144
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:37,370
I’ll gather it all up and sue, too. Get ready.

145
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:39,130
What do you mean, sue?

146
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:40,870
What sue?

147
00:12:40,870 --> 00:12:42,700
Just apologize and get it over with.

148
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:45,590
I have to do something wrong to apologize.

149
00:12:45,590 --> 00:12:49,100
There’s a reason for that woman’s insanity.

150
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:52,210
Her stubbornness let her sent her father away like that.
And she felt guilty.

151
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:54,120
Her siblings caught her in the act.

152
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,500
She was afraid that she would lose inheritance right.

153
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,730
At least agree to apology so that you can say something.

154
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,100
I’ll give you the opportunity to do so anyway.
To apologize on your knees.

155
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:05,860
An apology would really result in medical malpractice, you know.

156
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,740
There’s a lawsuit going on, and I’ll have to take the blame.

157
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,680
I can’t do that.

158
00:13:14,290 --> 00:13:16,150
Damn it!

159
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:22,100
Dr. Han Gye-jeol

160
00:13:22,100 --> 00:13:25,030
You know I’ve been having a hard time with that troublemaker, right?

161
00:13:25,030 --> 00:13:26,340
Of course I do.

162
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:29,780
I know all about the late payments.

163
00:13:29,780 --> 00:13:33,160
I even took the money from Pilseong Bio because of that, didn’t I?

164
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:35,340
So when others take care of one patient,

165
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:39,390
I take care of two or even three patients around the clock, committed to increasing sales.

166
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:41,630
How can you find another doctor like me?

167
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:42,890

What’s the point?

169
00:13:44,410 --> 00:13:48,200
Ten doctors can’t beat one Lord.

170
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:50,300
A Lord?

171
00:13:51,870 --> 00:13:55,440
But chairman, don’t you believe in Buddhism?

172
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,920
I’ve even made several Buddha’s Birthday lanterns.

173
00:13:57,920 --> 00:13:59,490
Not the Lord like that.

174
00:13:59,490 --> 00:14:01,930
It’s the Lord of the building.

175
00:14:01,930 --> 00:14:04,100
That woman is the Lord of that building.

176
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:05,100
What?

177
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:06,970
I heard that once Dr. Han is discharged,

178
00:14:06,970 --> 00:14:09,770
She would say nothing even if we owe money for years,

179
00:14:09,770 --> 00:14:10,940
And no interest is charged.

180
00:14:10,940 --> 00:14:12,150
So how much is that money?

181
00:14:12,150 --> 00:14:17,840
Can I just throw it all away and hold on tightly to you, Dr.Han?
Guess.

182
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,270
Why are you so scared? Are you okay?

183
00:14:27,270 --> 00:14:29,770
Is that all?

184
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:31,920

189

I’ll go and bring her in right away.

190

Okay.

191

You have to belittle me like that, don’t you?

Oh, your strength is really…

00:21:56,990 --> 00:22:02,440
At that time, I called out to my mother.

332
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:48,700
Yes, I applied for this position

333
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,740
because I want to work hard on research under an excellent professor

334
00:24:50,740 --> 00:24:51,450
(Graduation School & Major, Semyeong High School
College&University, Major, Yeonri Medical University)
because I want to work hard on research under an excellent professor

335
00:24:51,450 --> 00:24:52,560
and contribute a little to the development of medical care.
(Graduation School & Major, Semyeong High School
College&University, Major, Yeonri Medical University)

336
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:54,190
Excuse me,

337
00:24:54,190 --> 00:24:56,110
did you make a typo in your resume?

338
00:24:56,110 --> 00:25:01,320
How could it be Yeonri University? It should be Yeongi University, right?

339
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:04,720
No, it is Yeonri University.

340
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,800
Yeonri University?

341
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:09,420
Is there a university with this name?

342
00:25:09,420 --> 00:25:14,200
The one that’s been rumored to be abolished.

343
00:25:15,570 --> 00:25:19,490
Hey, I can hear your words!

344
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,310
Do you need reputation?

345
00:25:27,190 --> 00:25:30,630
Yes, I need a degree.

346
00:25:30,630 --> 00:25:31,790
Do you feel ashamed of your alma mater?

347
00:25:31,790 --> 00:25:34,160
No, I’m a capable doctor,

348
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,980
and I thank my alma mater for training me.

349
00:25:36,980 --> 00:25:38,510
Then why?

350
00:25:38,510 --> 00:25:40,930
Not long ago, I was sued.

351
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:43,370
An elderly man was involved in a traffic accident.

352
00:25:43,370 --> 00:25:45,020
A CT scan revealed a fracture in the cervical spine

353
00:25:45,020 --> 00:25:45,880
(C-spine - Cervical spine
Fractures - fractures and other symptoms)
A CT scan revealed a fracture in the cervical spine

354
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:47,960
and I recommended surgery.
(C-spine - Cervical spine
Fractures - fractures and other symptoms)

355
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,310
But instead, I was falsely accused of trying to extort money by extra treatment
(C-spine - Cervical spine
Fractures - fractures and other symptoms)

356
00:25:49,310 --> 00:25:51,770
because of my education background from a local university.

357
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:55,390
His daughter insisted on taking him to Seoul for treatment.

358
00:25:55,390 --> 00:25:57,700
I tried to stop it again and again.

359
00:25:57,700 --> 00:25:59,850
In the end, he passed away

360
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:01,380
on the way to Seoul.

361
00:26:01,380 --> 00:26:03,080
So do you feel wronged?

362
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:07,250
Yes, because my university reputation isn’t equal to my ability

363
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:09,520
resulting in his death, I feel wronged.

364
00:26:10,840 --> 00:26:13,480
I believe that at least the death

365
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,430
caused by the distrust of my words will not happen here.

366
00:26:15,430 --> 00:26:18,560
The reputation is needed to save patients.

367
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,460
But usually, it is these people with reputation

368
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,960
cause the death of the patients because they want to keep their reputation.

369
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:25,790
Do you have the confidence not to do that?

370
00:26:25,790 --> 00:26:30,030
So, you are being sued, right?

371
00:26:30,030 --> 00:26:33,190
It’s not written here.

372
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:34,980
What?

373
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:44,040
If you’ll make me fail in this way,

374
00:26:44,040 --> 00:26:45,210
why don’t you just

375
00:26:45,210 --> 00:26:46,580
let me fall off the pedestal?

376
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,930
It’s not incentives and penalties.

377
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:56,820
Ah, I should give it back.

378
00:27:00,830 --> 00:27:03,110
How about using it as an excuse to go see him again?

379
00:27:16,610 --> 00:27:17,950
Hello?

380
00:27:17,950 --> 00:27:19,940
I’m Prof. Do Jin-woo from Pilseong Hospital.

381
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,930
Pro…Professor.

382
00:27:21,930 --> 00:27:23,620
Are you available now?

383
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:27,120
Yes, of course. I’m coming..

384
00:27:57,310 --> 00:28:00,390
Ugh, it’s all wet.

385
00:28:00,390 --> 00:28:02,120
I am uncool enough in my daily life,

386
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:04,320
and today is a watered-down version?

387
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,500
Hello.

388
00:28:16,500 --> 00:28:18,070
Sorry to call you in a hurry.

389
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:19,320
But, what’s up?

390
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:22,140
Dr. Han Gye-jeol, are you free next week?

391
00:28:22,140 --> 00:28:23,830
Me?

392
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:32,610
I’m… I’m free at anytime.

393
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,680
It depends on your schedule.

394
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:36,890
Why Dr. Han’s work

395
00:28:36,890 --> 00:28:38,930
depends on my schedule?

396
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,980
Sorry.

397
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:45,660
Did you say work?

398
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:48,160
I wish you could come to work as soon as possible.

399
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,890
Didn’t I fail?

400
00:28:49,890 --> 00:28:52,100
I didn’t say that.

401
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,560
Of course I thought I failed

402
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,470
after being so embarrassed.

403
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:58,180
I did that on purpose to choose you.

404
00:28:58,180 --> 00:28:59,070
If I didn’t do that,

405
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:00,990
I’m sure they’d think it was a special recruitment.

406
00:29:00,990 --> 00:29:03,420
You say you did that on purpose,

407
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,700
but why?

408
00:29:07,810 --> 00:29:09,310
Didn’t you say that you need reputation?

409
00:29:09,310 --> 00:29:11,630
Well, you need reputation,

410
00:29:11,630 --> 00:29:13,340
but you don’t need someone to pull strings for you?

411
00:29:13,340 --> 00:29:15,440
Pull strings for me?

412
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:17,060
Yep.

413
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:48,430
How handsome!

414
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,390
She has failed again.

415
00:30:13,250 --> 00:30:15,230
One for me, please.

416
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:18,100
A person who makes good friends with the neighborhood dogs

417
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,180
with just a can of beer, needs alcohol?

418
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:22,070
Hey, you know what?

419
00:30:22,070 --> 00:30:23,460
The neighborhood dogs often come to the door to poop

420
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:24,800
in order to visit you.

421
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,330
They’re the wrong kind of dogs to hang out with.

422
00:30:27,330 --> 00:30:29,300
I’ll never get along with them anymore.

423
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,910
What, because of Pilseong Hospital?

424
00:30:44,910 --> 00:30:46,900
Hey, shame on them!

425
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,650
It’s no big deal!

426
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:49,930
They let me in.

427
00:30:52,530 --> 00:30:54,050
Why am I not going?

428
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,640
Are they crazy? Why did they choose you?

429
00:30:55,640 --> 00:30:56,880
I...

430
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:59,090
Someone pulled strings for me.

431
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:01,140
Why these guys say that someone pulled strings for their candidate

432
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:03,540
after they have done their selection?

433
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:05,590
Are you crazy? Is good to be pulled strings?

434
00:31:05,590 --> 00:31:06,630
Why are you laughing?

435
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:09,050
Living up to now, it has always been out of my own hands.

436
00:31:09,050 --> 00:31:10,210
Honestly, who else is willing to side with us

437
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:12,020
except our mom?

438
00:31:12,020 --> 00:31:13,720
None.

439
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,460
But after hearing that someone pulled strings for me,

440
00:31:16,460 --> 00:31:20,090
I feel like I also have a backer. He seems dependable.

441
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:21,880
Even if I’m pushed down from the sky

442
00:31:21,880 --> 00:31:22,740
I feel like I can still survive.

443
00:31:22,740 --> 00:31:23,310
That’s why everyone is talking about

444
00:31:23,310 --> 00:31:25,050
having a backer.

445
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:28,210
But who chose you?

446
00:31:28,210 --> 00:31:29,560
You don’t know any one of them.

447
00:31:31,790 --> 00:31:32,990
This guy

448
00:31:32,990 --> 00:31:35,480
is one of the interviewers.

449
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,720
The Cinderella guy?

450
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,380
It is real, not a daydream

451
00:31:38,380 --> 00:31:39,930
His name is Do Jin-woo,

452
00:31:39,930 --> 00:31:41,450
he is the professor of the Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery

453
00:31:41,450 --> 00:31:43,150
He’s…

454
00:31:43,150 --> 00:31:44,510
in his thirties.

455
00:31:44,510 --> 00:31:46,940
So, the one who saved you

456
00:31:46,940 --> 00:31:48,200
helped you again, right?

457
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:49,450
Isn’t it amazing?

458
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,780
This is called fate, right?

459
00:31:51,780 --> 00:31:53,040
What should I do, Chul.

460
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,170
I feel like I’m going to be married.

461
00:31:55,170 --> 00:31:57,790
It is amazing.

462
00:31:57,790 --> 00:31:59,740
How can a stalker find you?

463
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:00,610
A stalker?

464
00:32:00,610 --> 00:32:02,230
This means that he has been spying on you.

465
00:32:02,230 --> 00:32:04,030
And that is stalking.

466
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:05,620
He’s just paying attention,

467
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:06,880
How can you say he’s a stalker?

468
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:08,090
Look how happy you are.

469
00:32:08,090 --> 00:32:09,280
Open your eyes, sister.

470
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:11,290
Stalking is a crime, a crime!

471
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:12,820
We’ll see as time goes

472
00:32:12,820 --> 00:32:14,820
if it’s love or crime.

473
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:16,830
Do you think it’s easy having someone pulling strings for you?

474
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:18,620
If others know that, they will reject you.

475
00:32:18,620 --> 00:32:19,480
When your ability is not as good as they expected,

476
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,600
the one who chose you will be scolded,

477
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:23,600
leading to a bad ending.

478
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,360
So don’t go.

479
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:28,970
Hey, how can he pull strings for me?

480
00:32:28,970 --> 00:32:30,500
What kind of backer can a young professor has

481
00:32:30,500 --> 00:32:33,760
to let the hospital decided to choose me?

482
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,830
He’s just pretending to be powerful

483
00:32:35,830 --> 00:32:38,440
in order to give me a good impression.

484
00:32:38,440 --> 00:32:40,250
Oh, so cute.

485
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:25,020
Jeong-won?

486
00:33:25,020 --> 00:33:26,830
Brother.

487
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:28,010
Why don’t you tell me

488
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:28,820
that you are coming over?

489
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:30,000
Why are you coming back so late?

490
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:30,630
Is it my brother

491
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:32,290
who is busy with all the hospital affairs alone?

492
00:33:32,290 --> 00:33:34,120
Are you hungry? Just eat.

493
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:37,130
Jeong-won, today...

494
00:33:37,130 --> 00:33:39,640
I was an interviewer.

495
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,140
Brother, did you…

496
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,890
did you pick Dr. Han Gye-jeol?

497
00:33:45,060 --> 00:33:48,080
Do you have to do this?

498
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,090
As you know, for me,

499
00:33:49,090 --> 00:33:50,760
There’s nothing else I can do.

(Chairman Kim Pil-soo)

502
00:34:25,940 --> 00:34:27,920
Hello, Professor.

503
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:29,409
I’ll work hard.

504
00:34:29,409 --> 00:34:32,130
That’s not enough. Be good!

505
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,520
I’ll do my best.

506
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:34,920
No need.

507
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:37,889
Do Jin-woo is your rock. No need to worry.

508
00:34:37,889 --> 00:34:41,010
Did I really get an inside connection?

509

(Representative Diseases of Respiratory Organs Viral Cold and Pneumonia)

510
00:34:44,969 --> 00:34:46,679
Eonju Hospital?
(Representative Diseases of Respiratory Organs Viral Cold and Pneumonia)

511
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:47,590
Heard of this hospital.

512
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:50,770
Yeah. It has been greatly backed up by Eonju.

513
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,290
(Emergency Center)
Yeah. It has been greatly backed up by Eonju.

514
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:54,040
It has a new building and introduced many great doctors.
(Emergency Center)

515
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:56,280
Right, Ji Su-yeon.

516
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:59,870
I heard Dr. Ji Su-yeon went to work for it.

517
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,730
Yeah.

518
00:35:10,150 --> 00:35:12,620
Ji Su-yeon graduated from Hanguk University.

519
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:14,760
How could it hire this kind...

520
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:25,930
Give me the bullet.

521
00:35:25,930 --> 00:35:27,200
Yeah.

522
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,900
The patient is a 73-year-old male.

523
00:35:28,900 --> 00:35:31,250
He was sent here because of abdominal pain last night.

524
00:35:31,250 --> 00:35:33,460
He felt chills, vomited and then lost consciousness in the hospital.

525
00:35:33,460 --> 00:35:34,470
So he was put on a ventilator before intubation.

526
00:35:34,470 --> 00:35:36,580
(Endotracheal intubation Ventilator)
So he was put on a ventilator before intubation.

527
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:38,880
He suffered from acute cholecystitis, GB Perfo and septic shock.

528
00:35:38,880 --> 00:35:41,500
(Acute cholecystitis Gallbladder perforation Septic shock)
He suffered from acute cholecystitis, GB Perfo and septic shock.

529
00:35:41,500 --> 00:35:43,330
Why is he still in the emergency room?
(Acute cholecystitis Gallbladder perforation Septic shock)

530
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,880
That’s because...

531
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,420
The Surgery Department said they couldn’t do surgeries before the cure of sepsis. So they claimed he’s a medical patient.

532
00:35:49,420 --> 00:35:52,590
While the Medical Department refused because of the GB rupture and asked the Surgery Department to take the patient.

533
00:35:52,590 --> 00:35:53,910
So just leave the patient alone?

534
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:57,240
If he dies, can you be responsible for it?

535
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:00,270
It’s the first day Dr. Han works here, so she didn’t know the situation.

536
00:36:00,270 --> 00:36:01,500
Why did you speak up for her?

537
00:36:01,500 --> 00:36:03,490
Who are you?

538
00:36:05,210 --> 00:36:06,980
Didn’t you say you would work hard?

539
00:36:06,980 --> 00:36:08,820
Do your best?

540
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,490
Go to persuade the Surgery Department or the Medical Department.

541
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:13,560
You have to do something, right?

542
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:14,920
Yeah.

543
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:16,770
How about I do it?

544
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:19,980
This is an affair in the emergency room.

545
00:36:19,980 --> 00:36:21,700
Chief, stay out of it.

546
00:36:21,700 --> 00:36:27,140
I’m thinking about cleaning up the emergency room system for push-offs.

547
00:36:29,210 --> 00:36:34,040
The sepsis should be treated first. So let the Medical Department take over the patient.

548
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:38,620
Are you showing that she is yours?

549
00:36:38,620 --> 00:36:41,130
It was a really good show.

550
00:36:44,070 --> 00:36:46,130
Do Jin-woo from the Department of Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery.

551
00:36:46,130 --> 00:36:49,840
Yeah, please come to the emergency room to take a patient.

552
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,710
My person?

553
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,160
My person.

554
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:11,750
Han Gye-jeol.

555
00:37:20,280 --> 00:37:21,500
Long time no see.

556
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:24,380
There is always a reason for that.

557
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,490
I don’t think we can share a table.

558
00:37:30,490 --> 00:37:33,060
You, leave the hospital immediately.

559
00:37:34,970 --> 00:37:37,100
Are you declaring war on me?

560
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:39,510
Happy to see that you haven’t changed a little at all.

561
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,810
Tae Jeong-won.

562
00:37:40,810 --> 00:37:42,180
This is Pilseong Hospital,

563
00:37:42,180 --> 00:37:43,650
one of the top three hospitals in South Korea.

564
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:45,510
And it’s the best one.

565
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:50,000
Little birds can’t compete with storks.

566
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:51,800
Before you hurt your legs, leave.

567
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,240
Do birds walk? They fly, okay?

568
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:56,740
They have wings, so why worry about legs?

569
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,680
Do you think Professor Do is your wing?

570
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:03,370
My rumors seem to have spread to your place, the Pilseong Hospital in Yeongpo.

571
00:38:03,370 --> 00:38:06,470
I don’t need to waste my breath. That’s great.

572
00:38:07,750 --> 00:38:09,780
So don’t worry about my legs.

573
00:38:09,780 --> 00:38:11,340
You really haven’t changed.

574
00:38:11,340 --> 00:38:14,960
How can you fall into illusions and put yourself in the ditch?

575
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:20,310
You have no right to say this since you were the one who kicked me there.

576
00:38:20,310 --> 00:38:23,720
So I’m trying to save you from there.

577
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:27,050
Don’t believe Professor Do is nice to you out of good intentions.

578
00:38:27,050 --> 00:38:29,390
All good intentions come with a price.

579
00:38:29,390 --> 00:38:31,570
Don’t eat whatever you get because of hunger.

580
00:38:31,570 --> 00:38:33,010
Or you’ll get a stomachache.

581
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:34,790
Only you can have good intentions,

582
00:38:34,790 --> 00:38:37,170
and I have to be cheated, right?

583
00:38:37,170 --> 00:38:40,360
Besides, I’m not that hungry.

584
00:38:50,300 --> 00:38:51,940
Thank you.

585
00:38:55,720 --> 00:38:58,050
Do you want to know why Professor Do chose you?

586
00:38:58,050 --> 00:38:58,930
What?

587
00:38:58,930 --> 00:39:00,820
Dr. Tae.

588
00:39:00,820 --> 00:39:03,270
Oh. Jeong-won.

589
00:39:03,270 --> 00:39:05,310
Are you chatting?

590
00:39:05,310 --> 00:39:07,550
-No, no...
-Dr. Han looks tired.

591
00:39:07,550 --> 00:39:09,420
She needs my comfort.

592
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:10,240
Didn’t I tell you that

593
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:11,790
we met in the medical voluntary activities. And we’re good friends.

594
00:39:11,790 --> 00:39:14,540
-Well, good friends? Good friends and you...
-Have a drink.

595
00:39:14,540 --> 00:39:16,050
Buy you a drink.

596
00:39:16,050 --> 00:39:19,070
-I don’t want to drink.
-Dr. Han Gye-jeol.

597
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:22,450
Are you willing to have a drink with me?

598
00:39:22,450 --> 00:39:25,630
Me?

599
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:28,060
Good idea! Let’s go together.

600
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,550
No, no.

601
00:39:29,550 --> 00:39:32,150
I want to talk with Dr. Han.

602
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:35,670
Just the two of us?

603
00:39:47,670 --> 00:39:49,370
Cheers! Welcome!

604
00:39:49,370 --> 00:39:51,010
Thanks.

605
00:40:07,720 --> 00:40:09,940
Why did you become a doctor?

606
00:40:09,940 --> 00:40:11,160
What?

607
00:40:12,870 --> 00:40:15,620
Was that a little sudden?

608
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:18,810
No, not at all.

609
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:20,830
I’ve been asked for many times when I was a freshman.

610
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:24,550
So I’m surprised to be asked now.

611
00:40:28,580 --> 00:40:31,730
If it’s not convenient, you can refuse to tell me.

612
00:40:33,790 --> 00:40:41,030
My mom died in a traffic accident and I was there.

613
00:40:50,510 --> 00:40:51,930
Mom!

614
00:40:54,360 --> 00:40:56,310
I couldn’t do anything at that time.

615
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:04,460
If I had known how to do CPR, my mom would have been alive now.

616
00:41:06,020 --> 00:41:11,750
That’s not your fault.

617
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,740
I know. A 10-year-old kid can’t do anything.

618
00:41:18,740 --> 00:41:24,790
But I don’t want to experience the feeling of

619
00:41:24,790 --> 00:41:26,610
failing to save others again.

620
00:41:29,050 --> 00:41:31,570
I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have asked.

621
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:33,560
No, that’s alright.

622
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:38,140
Now that I can say this, maybe I’m not that guilty about my mom anymore.

623
00:41:45,450 --> 00:41:48,010
So

624
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:51,130
do you know my mom?

625
00:41:51,130 --> 00:41:55,670
Do I have to know her?

626
00:41:57,070 --> 00:41:58,350
Certainly not...

627
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:04,760
No, my mom didn’t send you to my side.

628
00:42:06,420 --> 00:42:10,810
Well, I’m saying nonsense.

629
00:42:14,430 --> 00:42:15,970
Oh, this one.

630
00:42:17,560 --> 00:42:23,860
Give this back to you.

631
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:27,190
What’s this?

632
00:42:27,190 --> 00:42:29,670
You lost it when you saved me.

633
00:42:29,670 --> 00:42:32,440
Sorry, I should have returned it to you earlier.

634
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:33,480
Saved you?

635
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:35,750
Who? Me?

636
00:42:35,750 --> 00:42:38,150
On the stairs that day.

637
00:42:38,150 --> 00:42:41,010
You’re my savior.

638
00:42:44,840 --> 00:42:47,330
It was rainy that day

639
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:49,170
and a dog passed by.

640
00:42:49,170 --> 00:42:51,690
Well, I don’t like dogs,

641
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:53,730
because I used to get chewed up by dogs.

642
00:42:53,730 --> 00:42:55,240
Are you a twin?

643
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,530
No, no, definitely not.

644
00:42:59,530 --> 00:43:02,000
That was really you.

645
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,920
So who is he?

646
00:43:09,130 --> 00:43:12,490
What do you want to say to me?

647
00:43:14,360 --> 00:43:15,810
Oh my god.

648
00:43:29,570 --> 00:43:36,110
To carry this man,

649
00:43:36,110 --> 00:43:40,260
it’s wise to exercise ever since spring.

650
00:43:53,730 --> 00:43:56,330
I’m the one who lost mom. Why did he drink so much...

651
00:43:59,660 --> 00:44:01,490
Professor Do.

652
00:44:01,490 --> 00:44:02,800
Professor Do, wake up.

653
00:44:02,800 --> 00:44:04,620
Professor Do, is it here?

654
00:44:06,110 --> 00:44:08,890
Professor Do, wake up.

655
00:44:12,810 --> 00:44:15,590
What? Are you Cinderella?

656
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,860
Why do you always lose something?

657
00:44:19,570 --> 00:44:20,810
What’s it? A wallet?

658
00:44:24,030 --> 00:44:26,420
Is she his mom?

659
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:34,010
So cute.

660
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:38,570
He looks just like his mom.

661
00:44:41,610 --> 00:44:43,150
Really?

662
00:44:44,410 --> 00:44:48,270
Sorry, it fell on the floor, so I picked it up.

663
00:44:48,270 --> 00:44:50,610
I’m sorry to you.

664
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:54,250
It’s rare for me to get drunk.

665
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,320
Who would get drunk because he wants to?

666
00:44:59,320 --> 00:45:01,440
Get drunk for the world,

667
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:04,760
for people around you,

668
00:45:09,500 --> 00:45:11,430
or for love.

669
00:45:13,480 --> 00:45:15,610
That’s always the case.

670
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,440
It’s your mom, right?

671
00:45:25,050 --> 00:45:27,220
Do I look like her?

672
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:27,870
Yes.

673
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:29,820
Your mom is really pretty.

674
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:33,000
Right.

675
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:33,920
What?

676
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:37,250
I was adopted to America with this picture.

677
00:45:37,250 --> 00:45:38,860
So...

678
00:45:38,860 --> 00:45:42,800
I don’t know whether she is really that pretty.

679
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:44,460
Sorry.

680
00:45:44,460 --> 00:45:47,280
I shouldn’t have said that.

681
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,080
Alright, that’s not a secret.

682
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:55,940
I was gonna tell you this anyway.

683
00:46:01,090 --> 00:46:05,240
Does he have a feeling for me?

684
00:46:13,920 --> 00:46:17,910
-Bring it to Professor Do. Sober him up.
-Good morning!

685
00:46:17,910 --> 00:46:22,560
Come to the meeting with the smell of alcohol. Good job.

686
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:24,330
You’re really an alcoholic.

687
00:46:29,390 --> 00:46:33,930
Jang Mi-sun received the surgery after drinking that day, right?

688
00:46:33,930 --> 00:46:35,270
Professor.

689
00:46:35,270 --> 00:46:36,360
Isn’t it weird?

690
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:39,810
It was a simple cholecystitis surgery, but the patient died.

691
00:46:39,810 --> 00:46:44,170
Maybe it was because she drank, but Ji Su-yeon was tortured.

692
00:46:44,170 --> 00:46:49,170
It must have been a lot of torture, so she went to the country.

693
00:46:49,170 --> 00:46:51,720
So Jang Mi-sun died.

694
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:53,920
What’s wrong? Damn it!

695
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:57,340
Damn it!

696
00:47:10,860 --> 00:47:11,930
What’s wrong?

697
00:47:15,910 --> 00:47:22,110
Jang Mi-sun died because of heart failure during the cholecystitis surgery I performed.

698
00:47:22,110 --> 00:47:28,490
Although the open record said it was cardiac arrest due to heart failure,

699
00:47:28,490 --> 00:47:31,520
I think the real reason was too much adrenaline.

700
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:33,800
If that’s the case...

701
00:47:33,800 --> 00:47:36,240
It was not a simple cholecystitis surgery.

702
00:47:36,240 --> 00:47:39,620
She was with malignant brown cell tumor at the same time.

703
00:47:39,620 --> 00:47:41,740
You must have seen the CT before the surgery.

704
00:47:41,740 --> 00:47:43,420
How couldn’t you know that?

705
00:47:43,420 --> 00:47:46,790
I found the CT was normal before the surgery.

706
00:47:46,790 --> 00:47:49,760
I didn’t notice any cancer cell.

707
00:47:49,760 --> 00:47:51,900
Someone changed the CT.

708
00:47:51,900 --> 00:47:53,540
How is that possible? Who would...

709
00:47:53,540 --> 00:47:55,490
You know Dr. Ji Su-yeon, right?

710
00:48:00,430 --> 00:48:03,630
After the surgery, she went to another hospital. And I felt quite strange about this.

711
00:48:03,630 --> 00:48:05,090
I went to find her for several times.

712
00:48:05,090 --> 00:48:08,920
Finally, she admitted that she made a mistake.

713
00:48:08,920 --> 00:48:11,980
She promised to testify if the family filed a lawsuit,

714
00:48:11,980 --> 00:48:13,500
but disappeared suddenly.

715
00:48:15,760 --> 00:48:19,600
This was after Chairman went to the Eonju Hospital...

716
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:23,140
Why did you tell me this?

717
00:48:23,140 --> 00:48:25,320
It has nothing to do with me.

718
00:48:27,290 --> 00:48:28,870
I... I got to go.

719
00:48:28,870 --> 00:48:32,650
-What did Chairman and Dr. Ji say?
-How should I know?

720
00:48:32,650 --> 00:48:34,600
Because you heard it.

721
00:49:03,270 --> 00:49:04,710
Ah... Oh my god!

722
00:49:07,570 --> 00:49:08,800
Han Gye-jeol!

723
00:49:08,800 --> 00:49:10,420
Lawsuit! What lawsuit?

724
00:49:10,420 --> 00:49:12,600
Oh, it hurts!

725
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:15,280
Let’s wait and see who’ll win the lawsuit.

726
00:49:15,280 --> 00:49:21,290
Do you think I will let you win? Damn it!

727
00:49:44,610 --> 00:49:47,290
What did they say?

728
00:49:47,290 --> 00:49:50,130
It would cause the hospital to lose recognition. Don’t say anything about the CT.

729
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:51,810
Did Chairman threaten her?

730
00:49:51,810 --> 00:49:52,740
I don’t know.

731
00:49:52,740 --> 00:49:53,990
I didn’t hear anything.

732
00:49:53,990 --> 00:49:56,140
You must have heard it,

733
00:49:56,140 --> 00:49:58,530
or you wouldn’t react like this.

734
00:50:07,880 --> 00:50:09,770
You believed I’ve seen something,

735
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:11,140
so you chose me, right?

736
00:50:11,140 --> 00:50:12,900
Just because I’m the witness.

737
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:13,600
Yes.

738
00:50:13,600 --> 00:50:16,540
You want me to report Dr. Ji in exchange for choosing me.

739
00:50:16,540 --> 00:50:20,510
Well, you’re really selfish.

740
00:50:20,510 --> 00:50:23,060
I didn’t do anything wrong. It was all Ji Su-yeon’s fault.

741
00:50:23,060 --> 00:50:25,590
Anyway, you want to prove you’re innocent.

742
00:50:25,590 --> 00:50:30,450
What will happen to Dr. Ji? How will I feel? You really don’t care, right?

743
00:50:30,450 --> 00:50:33,220
Dr. Han, I just want to expose the truth.

744
00:50:33,220 --> 00:50:37,910
Truth... Easy for you to say.

745
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:40,590
Professor, do you know people with no power

746
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:43,070
and no support like me can’t have?

747
00:50:44,940 --> 00:50:46,520
Enemies.

748
00:50:48,180 --> 00:50:50,120
In order not to have even a trivial enemy,

749
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:51,320
I’ve been looking over my shoulder.

750
00:50:51,320 --> 00:50:55,220
But now you’re asking me to stab another doctor in the back.

751
00:50:55,220 --> 00:50:58,420
I can’t do it. I have to live.

752
00:50:58,420 --> 00:51:01,930
-I’ll be responsible no matter what happens.
-How?

753
00:51:01,930 --> 00:51:04,220
It was not Dr. Ji’s fault.

754
00:51:04,220 --> 00:51:07,590
People working for the Pilseong Hospital are in every hospital in South Korea.

755
00:51:07,590 --> 00:51:11,430
If I get caught by Chairman, I can’t even be a doctor making a monthly salary.

756
00:51:11,430 --> 00:51:16,010
So... so why didn’t you tell me this at the beginning?

757
00:51:16,010 --> 00:51:17,900
Ask me to testify and promise to reward me.

758
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:21,220
Then I wouldn’t have come to work here so happily.

759
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:26,790
It’s shameless to play tricks on me.

760
00:51:26,790 --> 00:51:29,190
I told you that I’ve pulled strings for you.

761
00:51:29,190 --> 00:51:31,790
If you had asked why, I would have told you all.

762
00:51:31,790 --> 00:51:36,720
Aren’t you also doing wrong without considering the cost?

763
00:51:36,720 --> 00:51:42,430
I misunderstood that... it’s just a good intention without any cost.

764
00:51:42,430 --> 00:51:44,700
Do you have any reason to think so?

765
00:51:44,700 --> 00:51:45,870
The reason is...

766
00:51:53,050 --> 00:51:54,310
Right...

767
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,160
It was ridiculous from the beginning.

768
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:10,060
You...

769
00:52:15,740 --> 00:52:19,830
Where did you start listening?

770
00:52:19,830 --> 00:52:23,780
Dr. Tae knows that, don’t worry.

771
00:52:30,430 --> 00:52:33,340
Don’t mistake Professor Do’s kindness for good intentions.

772
00:52:33,340 --> 00:52:36,360
There is no such thing as kindness without cost.

773
00:52:36,360 --> 00:52:40,750
If you eat everything because of hunger, you’ll get stomachache.

774
00:52:40,750 --> 00:52:42,970
Did you say that because you knew everything?

775
00:53:33,750 --> 00:53:36,140
Maybe it’s fate.

776
00:53:36,140 --> 00:53:37,120
Chul, what should I do?

777
00:53:37,120 --> 00:53:39,210
I think I’m getting married.

778
00:53:40,940 --> 00:53:42,930
What a shame.

779
00:53:44,450 --> 00:53:46,810
Who would like someone like me?

780
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,980
Did I hear that wrong?

781
00:54:12,980 --> 00:54:16,110
That guy seems to have heard something, right?

782
00:54:16,110 --> 00:54:19,710
Yes, maybe he’s going to die soon,

783
00:54:19,710 --> 00:54:22,510
so he can hear what ordinary people can’t hear.

784
00:54:22,510 --> 00:54:25,340
Are you sure it’s this guy?

785
00:54:25,340 --> 00:54:26,550
Haven’t you seen that?

786
00:54:29,170 --> 00:54:32,380
He looks exactly like the deity.

787
00:54:32,380 --> 00:54:36,680
Ah... Can’t we not come this time?

788
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,020
Wake up.

789
00:54:40,020 --> 00:54:43,750
There’s no breeze at night. It’s so hot.

790
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:49,030
The season of deity will start soon.

791
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:09,030
Call me if there’s any problem.

792
00:55:09,030 --> 00:55:10,430
Hey, Dr. Han.

793
00:55:18,110 --> 00:55:20,010
Dr. Han, we...

794
00:55:23,470 --> 00:55:27,030
Please let me have a good meal.

795
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:29,890
Dr. Han,

796
00:55:32,890 --> 00:55:34,560
I have something to show you.

797
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:42,340
Professor,

798
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,630
I’m going to stay here no matter what.

799
00:55:44,630 --> 00:55:45,980
Don’t waste your time.

800
00:55:45,980 --> 00:55:47,570
Just a minute.

801
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:50,450
What are you doing, Professor?

802
00:55:50,450 --> 00:55:52,260
Professor, I won’t change my mind anyway.

803
00:55:52,260 --> 00:55:55,360
Let go, everyone is watching...

804
00:55:55,360 --> 00:55:57,300
Let go!

805
00:56:01,170 --> 00:56:04,230
(Name: Do Jin-woo
DOB: 17/06/1988)

806
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,810
Jang Mi-sun is my mother.

807
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:18,080
As a son, even if I knew what my mother looked like...

808
00:56:21,650 --> 00:56:24,780
At the beginning...

809
00:56:24,780 --> 00:56:29,070
Why didn’t you tell me at the beginning?

810
00:56:29,070 --> 00:56:32,170
Then I wouldn’t have said that.

811
00:56:33,160 --> 00:56:34,200
Because I was afraid

812
00:56:36,390 --> 00:56:38,980
if I said it,

813
00:56:38,980 --> 00:56:41,030
it would be like I killed my mother myself.

814
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:42,320
I was afraid.

815
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:45,840
I wanted revenge.

816
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,770
I wanted to show her how good the son she abandoned.

817
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:51,080
I wanted to see her regret.

818
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:56,000
But I didn’t mean to revenge in this way.

819
00:56:57,770 --> 00:56:59,630
It’s not your fault.

820
00:56:59,630 --> 00:57:01,920
If she hadn’t met me, she’d be alive and well.

821
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:03,030
No.

822
00:57:03,030 --> 00:57:05,890
It drives me crazy just thinking about it.

823
00:57:05,890 --> 00:57:07,270
I just hope it’s not my fault.

824
00:57:07,270 --> 00:57:08,980
That’s why...

825
00:57:08,980 --> 00:57:10,750
I’m obsessed with Dr. Ji Su-yeon.

826
00:57:10,750 --> 00:57:13,270
It’s not your fault, it’s Kim Pil-soo’s fault.

827
00:57:14,900 --> 00:57:16,190
What?

828
00:57:16,190 --> 00:57:16,580
(Eonju Hospital)
What?

829
00:57:16,580 --> 00:57:20,420
Why don’t I tell the public what you’ve done?
(Eonju Hospital)

830
00:57:20,420 --> 00:57:20,930
Why don’t I tell the public what you’ve done?

831
00:57:23,420 --> 00:57:24,610
What?

832
00:57:24,610 --> 00:57:26,440
You ordered me to change the CT.

833
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,590
That’s why Jang Mi-sun died.

834
00:57:29,030 --> 00:57:30,850
(Eonju Hospital)

835
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:35,340
(Seoul Pilseong Hospital)

836
00:57:36,440 --> 00:57:37,620
(Seoul Pilseong Hospital)

837
00:57:44,690 --> 00:57:45,590
Professor Do.

838
00:57:46,830 --> 00:57:47,590
Professor Do.

839
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,330
Oh no.

840
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,600
I’ll report myself.

841
00:58:04,600 --> 00:58:05,330
What?

842
00:58:05,330 --> 00:58:08,100
Say that the CT was switched and admit that it was medical malpractice.

843
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:10,230
Then you’ll be punished too.

844
00:58:10,230 --> 00:58:12,510
This is a fight that I’ll bet everything on to start.

845
00:58:12,510 --> 00:58:14,240
Get Kim Pil-soo to court in this way,

846
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:16,290
then I can find out why my mother died.

847
00:58:16,290 --> 00:58:17,400
For that,

848
00:58:19,530 --> 00:58:22,090
I really need your testimony.

849
00:58:22,090 --> 00:58:23,200
What?

850
00:58:24,660 --> 00:58:26,830
I... I...

851
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:31,660
I don’t want to let my mom die without doing anything.

852
00:58:31,660 --> 00:58:34,060
I don’t have the courage to do that.

853
00:58:57,890 --> 00:58:59,030
Dr. Han.

854
00:59:05,260 --> 00:59:06,340
That ring,

855
00:59:09,900 --> 00:59:11,590
please give it back to me now.

856
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,380
Before, you said it wasn’t yours.

857
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:16,430
And you said you never saved my life.

858
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:20,420
I didn’t want to make you owe me this way.

859
00:59:25,070 --> 00:59:28,230
But now you think it’s better for me to owe you, right?

860
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,820
Is that why you confessed?

861
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:51,930
I’m crazy.

862
01:00:02,860 --> 01:00:04,320
What should I do?

863
01:00:04,320 --> 01:00:05,570
Sorry. Give it back to you.

864
01:00:05,570 --> 01:00:06,890
I may be temporarily insane.

865
01:00:06,890 --> 01:00:09,640
You must be freaking out. After all, it’s about your mom.

866
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:11,420
I know how desperate you must be.

867
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:13,750
Although I know better than anyone,

868
01:00:13,750 --> 01:00:15,290
I just don’t have the courage.

869
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,850
Why don’t you believe me?

870
01:00:16,850 --> 01:00:18,820
It’s just... just...

871
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:20,610
Just be my savior.

872
01:00:20,610 --> 01:00:22,700
You are my savior, so I can’t help it.

873
01:00:22,700 --> 01:00:25,260
At least let me use this excuse in the end.

874
01:00:25,260 --> 01:00:27,970
I won’t make you regret it.

875
01:00:27,970 --> 01:00:31,360
I will be responsible to the end and will not let you regret alone.

876
01:00:33,690 --> 01:00:35,380
About this ring,

877
01:00:35,380 --> 01:00:38,340
let’s wait until everything settles.

878
01:00:38,340 --> 01:00:40,320
Before that, I’ll keep it.

879
01:00:47,230 --> 01:00:48,830
Thank you,

880
01:00:48,830 --> 01:00:49,940
Dr. Han.

881
01:01:17,830 --> 01:01:20,340
I found this document when I was making amends for Jang Mi-sun.

Jang Mi-sun

887
01:01:32,750 --> 01:01:34,740
is Do Jin-woo’s biological mother.

888
01:01:34,740 --> 01:01:35,500
Yes.

889
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,250
No wonder he has been seizing not to let go.

890
01:01:43,620 --> 01:01:45,140
He is going to dig to the end.

891
01:01:51,300 --> 01:01:52,310

892

Sir, I need to get off.

904
01:02:53,300 --> 01:02:54,380
So hot.

905
01:02:57,870 --> 01:02:59,770
I remember it’s around here.

906
01:03:11,690 --> 01:03:13,240
Why doesn’t he answer the phone?

I can save you.

I’ll save you.

931
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,750
I’ll save you this time.

No.

No. No.

Jade God, Horn God.

943
01:07:01,540 --> 01:07:03,530
I seem to have said that

944
01:07:03,530 --> 01:07:07,890
I would kill the first mortal I saw.

945
01:07:09,960 --> 01:07:11,240
Professor Do,

946
01:07:11,240 --> 01:07:13,380
what’s wrong with you, Professor Do?

947
01:07:14,830 --> 01:07:16,800
What... What should we do?

948
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,810
At this rate, he’ll really kill her.

949
01:07:18,810 --> 01:07:20,660
What’s wrong with you?

950
01:07:20,660 --> 01:07:23,380
It’s all your fault. If only we’d be earlier...

951
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:26,230
Is this the time to decide who’s right or wrong?

952
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:27,700
Let’s save our lives first. Run.

953
01:07:30,780 --> 01:07:31,380
Professor Do.

954
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:34,240
Jade God, how dare you run away?

955
01:07:51,130 --> 01:07:52,660
Damn it.

956
01:07:54,650 --> 01:07:56,400
Golden car.

957
01:07:56,400 --> 01:07:57,790
Damn it.

958
01:08:04,550 --> 01:08:06,610
-Damn it.
-You fool.

959
01:08:06,610 --> 01:08:08,910
Did you really think you could get away from me?

960
01:08:08,910 --> 01:08:10,160
Wait, wait.

961
01:08:10,160 --> 01:08:11,550
Deity. Deity. Deity.

962
01:08:11,550 --> 01:08:12,610
Deity. Deity.

963
01:08:12,610 --> 01:08:13,590
You... Let me explain.

964
01:08:13,590 --> 01:08:14,600
Let me explain.

965
01:08:14,600 --> 01:08:17,189
Please, let me explain.

966
01:08:17,189 --> 01:08:19,010
Do you think I ran away

967
01:08:19,010 --> 01:08:20,140
to save my own life?

968
01:08:20,140 --> 01:08:21,950
I ran to save her. To save her.

969
01:08:21,950 --> 01:08:23,229
Just to save her.

970
01:08:23,229 --> 01:08:24,840
Deity, don’t listen to him.

971
01:08:24,840 --> 01:08:27,000
Anyway, cut her first.

972
01:08:27,000 --> 01:08:28,689
Stop! Stop!

973
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,859
Do you know what the world is like now?

974
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:34,210
It’s not the same as it was 99 years ago.

975
01:08:34,210 --> 01:08:36,520
Do you know the CCTV? CCTV.

976
01:08:36,520 --> 01:08:38,950
CCTV. CCTV.

977
01:08:38,950 --> 01:08:41,069
CCTV is all over the place.

978
01:08:41,069 --> 01:08:42,250
You can’t just kill someone like that.

979
01:08:42,250 --> 01:08:43,910
No, you can’t.

980
01:08:43,910 --> 01:08:45,189
Then just say it, why did you run away?

981
01:08:45,189 --> 01:08:46,069
Why?

982
01:08:46,069 --> 01:08:48,260
Do you think he’ll listen to me?

983
01:08:48,260 --> 01:08:49,920
He doesn’t even listen to the Creator,

984
01:08:49,920 --> 01:08:51,310
let alone me.

985
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:52,520
Damn...

986
01:08:52,520 --> 01:08:55,840
He came after me in a rage because I ran away.

987
01:08:55,840 --> 01:08:57,630
Otherwise she would have been dead.

988
01:08:57,630 --> 01:08:59,740
That’s how I saved a woman.

989
01:09:02,390 --> 01:09:03,710
I hear you clearly.

990
01:09:03,710 --> 01:09:06,899
But how long do I have to stand like this?

991
01:09:08,200 --> 01:09:11,750
When are you going to pay my respects!

992
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:17,920
Two, three.

993
01:09:18,930 --> 01:09:23,069
The God of Greed, Jade God, Your Deity.

994
01:09:23,069 --> 01:09:27,800
After 99 years, you have suffered a lot.

995
01:09:27,800 --> 01:09:30,430
The God of Rumors, Horn God, Your Deity.

996
01:09:30,430 --> 01:09:33,819
For the next 99 days, we will serve you wholeheartedly.

997
01:09:33,819 --> 01:09:36,950
You really respect me.

998
01:09:36,950 --> 01:09:41,430
Serve me wholeheartedly. What a terrible car!

999
01:09:41,430 --> 01:09:44,630
It’s 24K gold. How can you treat our golden car like this...

1000
01:09:44,630 --> 01:09:48,160
You’re here to be punished. Don’t be so picky.

1001
01:09:49,710 --> 01:09:50,880
What are you doing?

1002
01:09:55,070 --> 01:09:56,330
Your Deity, Your Deity.

1003
01:09:57,260 --> 01:09:59,610
(Seoul Yeongpo Expressway)

1004
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:05,560
I’ve told you many times.

1005
01:10:05,560 --> 01:10:08,730
When I open my eyes, being shot by the Japanese

1006
01:10:11,490 --> 01:10:14,320
or stabbed by a scoundrel

1007
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:22,920
will never happen again.

1008
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:26,860
I said that I would open my eyes in my home comfortably.

1009
01:10:26,860 --> 01:10:28,380
Can’t you do that?

1010
01:10:28,380 --> 01:10:30,230
You made me be like this again.

1011
01:10:30,230 --> 01:10:31,870
Sorry.

1012
01:10:31,870 --> 01:10:33,660
You ignored what I said.

1013
01:10:33,660 --> 01:10:36,450
You’ve been with me for a long time and feel comfortable, right?

1014
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:41,290
Are you kidding? So boring.

1015
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:44,730
Just being together with you makes my organs jump out.

1016
01:10:44,730 --> 01:10:46,830
And I’m losing my mind.

1017
01:10:46,830 --> 01:10:49,110
What’s wrong?

1018
01:10:49,110 --> 01:10:51,970
Let me make you really lose your mind?

1019
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:54,870
Your Deity. Your Deity.

1020
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:57,280
Please shut up.

1021
01:10:57,280 --> 01:10:57,580
(Dr. Han)
Please shut up.

1022
01:10:57,580 --> 01:10:59,080
(Dr. Han)

1023
01:11:10,620 --> 01:11:13,940
The subscriber you dialed cannot be connected...

1024
01:11:20,660 --> 01:11:22,650
(Emergency Center)

1025
01:12:07,830 --> 01:12:10,650
The right night for killing.

1026
01:12:39,530 --> 01:12:43,420
(Next episode preview)

1027
01:12:43,530 --> 01:12:45,220
Why did you run away?

1028
01:12:45,220 --> 01:12:48,690
I don’t like you, so don’t bother me anymore.

1029
01:12:48,690 --> 01:12:51,980
Apologize on your knees.

1030
01:12:51,980 --> 01:12:54,080
How could I obey what Han Gye-jeol said?

1031
01:12:54,080 --> 01:12:56,130
Do you know about this ring?

1032
01:12:56,130 --> 01:12:57,250
Of course.

1033
01:12:57,250 --> 01:12:59,960
Finally, there’s a woman who can break the curse.

1034
01:12:59,960 --> 01:13:02,440
But why are you sure it’s Han Gye-jeol?

1035
01:13:02,440 --> 01:13:04,290
Because my heart flipped.

1036
01:13:04,290 --> 01:13:07,460
Although I’ve lost my memory, I still have the love.

1037
01:13:07,460 --> 01:13:08,850
Let me protect you.

1038
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,640
Let’s meet officially.

1039
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,830
Nice to meet you, Deity.
