00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,840
(Episode 5)

2
00:00:15,180 --> 00:00:18,020
I will protect you, Seol Hui.

3
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:20,160
O Hyeon

4
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:48,960
So you are Seol Hui.

5
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:55,570
Is it because I am bounded by the vow to
protect you

6
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,300
that I am waiting for you?

7
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:03,780
But for all those long days, you never looked for me.

8
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:14,660
Even if there is a reason I loved you,

9
00:01:16,270 --> 00:01:19,440
the drought and heat of the road to
hades have burnt me into nothing,

10
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:21,940
now I can’t even feel to be moved.

11
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:23,740
Love is actually…

12
00:01:25,539 --> 00:01:27,250
the nothing of nothing.

13
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,340
Deity.

14
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:41,870
Am I… Am I already dead?

15
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:43,270
What?

16
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:49,509
I've fallen into the sea and suddenly I can
see you.

17
00:01:50,650 --> 00:01:53,259
Is this the flashback of my life?

18
00:01:53,259 --> 00:01:56,610
Now the ups and downs of my life

19
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:00,340
are passing through my mind like a
panorama?

20
00:02:00,340 --> 00:02:06,020
What are you in my life? Are you the
death?

21
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:08,320
Who are you calling the death?

22
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,370
Then are you the decline?

23
00:02:09,370 --> 00:02:11,090
God damn decline.

24
00:02:11,090 --> 00:02:12,600
You don’t even know if you are alive or
dead,

25
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:14,270
how could you become a doctor to save
lives?

26
00:02:14,270 --> 00:02:15,360
Tell me the truth,

27
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,090
have you actually got a medical license,
are you an imposter?

28
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,470
Are you really the Deity?

29
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,070
What’s going on?

30
00:02:28,070 --> 00:02:30,270
Are there lingering feelings?

31
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:34,770
Han Gye-jeol, do you like me?

32
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,240
Why are you asking this?

33
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:39,350
If we are in the underworld, you may
meet the one you want to meet most.

34
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:42,500
It could be the one you miss the most or
the one you want to kill the most.

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:43,970
Whatever it is, love or hate,

36
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,660
do you so hurry to meet me?

37
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:51,390
How could it be?

38
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:54,390
So you are not dead.

39
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:58,270
Congrats on staying in this hellish world.

40
00:02:59,510 --> 00:03:01,420
Thank you very much.

41
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:05,610
Thank you for allowing me to stay long
in this hellish world.

42
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,090
Let’s leave.

43
00:03:11,110 --> 00:03:13,110
Whether it's to the hospital or wherever, let's go first.

44
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:28,510
It was you.

45
00:03:28,510 --> 00:03:32,130
It was you who saved me on the stairs,
right?

46
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,600
This ring fell off too on the stairs at that
time.

47
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:38,240
Didn’t you say that you didn’t know
about this ring?

48
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,020
You shout angrily that you wouldn't
know even if you did.

49
00:03:41,050 --> 00:03:44,850
At that moment, even if I knew, I didn’t
want to know.

50
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,130
Because I didn’t want to have any
relation with you anymore.

51
00:03:48,130 --> 00:03:51,460
If you can choose whether to have
relationships or not, it would not be fate.

52
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:56,110
I feel bad for being led totally by you.

53
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:58,930
I thought my life was my own doing, I
felt very angry.

54
00:03:58,930 --> 00:04:01,510
But to my surprise, this is also the
Creator’s plan.

55
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,420
Let’s have a try.

56
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,340
How can the Creator make a road that's only mud?

57
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:11,840
There must be flowers and butterflies too.

58
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:28,140
I'm fine. Can you put me down, please?

59
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:30,470
People are looking at us.

60
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:34,210
Don't worry about who's watching you,
just worry about who's holding you.

61
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:35,670
What have you been eating?

62
00:04:35,670 --> 00:04:38,290
I will gain weight even if I only
drink water.

63
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:40,290
There's no such person.

64
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:43,460
You put your hand on the chest and think
about it. What have you been eating like
drinking water?

65
00:04:46,050 --> 00:04:48,530
Your hand is on the wrong place

66
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:53,110
Your heart is beating so fast.

67
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,870
It's the end of the curse. How can it not be beating?

68
00:04:59,870 --> 00:05:03,470
I'm sure it's because I so happy to see Seol Hui.

69
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:07,180
(Feiyun Clinic)

70
00:05:08,630 --> 00:05:11,130
By the way, how did you become like that?

71
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:12,310
Why did you fall into the sea?

72
00:05:12,310 --> 00:05:17,100
Well, when I was waiting for you at the
lighthouse, a man attacked me.

73
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,540
What?

74
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:21,050
Who?

75
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:21,860
I don’t know.

76
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:23,800
What does he look like? At least you've
seen what he looks like, right?

77
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,290
He was wearing a mask.

78
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,810
So you're saying you didn't see what he
looks like?

79
00:05:26,810 --> 00:05:29,450
If I want to beat him up, I have to know
what he looks like.

80
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:32,380
I didn’t mean to miss it.

81
00:05:32,380 --> 00:05:34,450
Starting with the punks in the
neighborhood,

82
00:05:34,450 --> 00:05:38,350
and torturing them one by one, we'll get
the guy one day.

83
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,120
Don't they say there are always thugs in
places like that?

84
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:42,920
Why did you go there alone even you knew?

85
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,659
Is there something pretty? You've got a
lot of nerve.

86
00:05:44,659 --> 00:05:47,470
Have I?

87
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:49,230
I turned into this way because of whom?

88
00:05:49,230 --> 00:05:50,400
Because of whom?

89
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,870
Why don't we start with that guy and
torture him?

90
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,080
That's a good idea. I hope you'll do that.

91
00:05:57,750 --> 00:05:59,460
Not to the extent of wishing to do so.

92
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,450
That guy, it's not me.

93
00:06:02,450 --> 00:06:05,190
Who was the one who didn't show up
when he said he would?

94
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,620
Was it me?

95
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,560
(Today I don’t have to work, do you want
to go to the lighthouse for an outing?
Deity: Fine.)

96
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,780
Reply…

97
00:06:23,820 --> 00:06:27,330
It's true that you cook the best meat, Ok Shin.

98
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,640
You just found out that?

99
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,570
Lord Deity.

100
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:37,570
You didn't even tell us where you were going.

101
00:07:17,910 --> 00:07:20,050
What's wrong? What are you doing?

102
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:22,520
Han Gye-jeol had an accident when she
was waiting for me.

103
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,800
She almost died.

104
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,540
Did something happen at the lighthouse?

105
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:28,130
So it was you.

106
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:32,200
It was you, Gak Shin, who touched my phone.

107
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:37,150
Why would you do such a thing?

108
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,220
No answer?

109
00:07:47,240 --> 00:07:49,100
Gak Shin!

110
00:07:49,100 --> 00:07:53,240
I'm thinking of replacing the pillars of the
Daeungbojeon Hall of Jeondeugsa.

111
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,350
It would be a good idea to chop off your
limbs and make them into pillars.

112
00:07:59,350 --> 00:08:01,200
What do you think?

113
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:07,190
You don't know?

114
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,490
It was me. I did it.

115
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,480
You?

116
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:20,360
Why?

117
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:22,480
Didn't you say Han Gye-jeol wasn't Seol
Hui?

118
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:25,160
But she's still bugging you.

119
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:28,780
So I cooperated a bit to wake her up.

120
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,650
I'm just trying to help you out, and you
don’t even want to praise me,

121
00:08:31,650 --> 00:08:34,480
but want to chop me up!

122
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:38,640
That’s right.

123
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,059
Didn't you say you hated Han Gye-jeol
and wanted to make her disappear
forever?

124
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:48,080
Well…

125
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:50,810
Take these away now!

126
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,120
You can't even understand our loyalty.

127
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,140
You didn't fall in love with Han Gye-jeol
so quickly, did you?

128
00:09:13,140 --> 00:09:16,300
Are you saying I like her?

129
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:21,150
They say you don't even know that the
axe handle is broken when you watch the
gods play chess.

130
00:09:21,150 --> 00:09:24,350
I thought it was the human’s axe handle
that was broken,

131
00:09:24,350 --> 00:09:26,540
but it turned out to be a god’s.

132
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:28,520
You’re too busy having fun with human
women,

133
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:31,320
and have forgotten all about the curse and
Seol Hui.

134
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,830
What having fun?

135
00:09:32,830 --> 00:09:34,980
Do you understand the meaning of the
gods?

136
00:09:34,980 --> 00:09:36,250
You demigod.

137
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:40,060
I don't know. Are you sure there's a
deeper meaning?

138
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,750
It's because Han Gye-jeol is that woman.

139
00:09:44,750 --> 00:09:45,730
What?

140
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:47,130
What does that mean?

141
00:09:48,710 --> 00:09:53,270
Han Gye-jeol is that woman, Seol Hui,
after all.

142
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,260
That's...

143
00:09:59,590 --> 00:10:01,470
What are you laughing at?

144
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,850
You said that she was Seol Hui, then you
said not, and now you say she is again.

145
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:07,440
Why are you doing this?

146
00:10:08,070 --> 00:10:12,240
Just say you want to fall in love.

147
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,500
As a god, what is this?

148
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,450
It’s O Hyeon.

149
00:10:18,450 --> 00:10:20,190
What is O Hyeon?

150
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,850
The name Seol Hui used to call me.

151
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,430
You are really…

152
00:10:25,430 --> 00:10:26,160
Yes.

153
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,240
I kissed her and saw her past life.

154
00:10:31,770 --> 00:10:33,730
Then you shouldn't do that now.

155
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,500
Then what?

156
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:39,960
Look,

157
00:10:39,960 --> 00:10:41,480
What do you think?

158
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:44,430
So you want me to propose to her?

159
00:10:44,430 --> 00:10:49,120
Ok Shin, she is one who should confess,
not me.

160
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,330
You don't understand.

161
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:54,570
A girl would never confess her love first.

162
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,950
What if it gets awkward after that?

163
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,060
Girls are very smart.

164
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:59,970
They wouldn't do something like that to
lose out.

165
00:10:59,970 --> 00:11:03,290
That's why you have to propose first,
Lord Deity.

166
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:06,160
A cake, a ring, and a confession.

167
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:08,140
She'll be so moved

168
00:11:08,140 --> 00:11:09,220
that her tears will flowing.

169
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:12,620
Han Gye-jeol, immersed in this
atmosphere, will surely confess after you.

170
00:11:12,620 --> 00:11:13,840
Forget it.

171
00:11:13,840 --> 00:11:17,620
It is said that it is better not to make a
rash attack.

172
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:20,330
If it doesn’t work once, then do it twice,
if it still doesn’t work, try again.

173
00:11:20,330 --> 00:11:22,400
You need to fart more to shit.

174
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,910
What shit?

175
00:11:23,910 --> 00:11:25,230
I’ll arrange this.

176
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:27,180
You just need to make an appointment with her.

177
00:11:28,310 --> 00:11:29,860
Well…

178
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:32,130
Are you not confident to make an
appointment with her?

179
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,580
Is that it?

180
00:11:37,210 --> 00:11:39,400
Is it difficult to make an appointment?

181
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,560
As the saying goes, strike while the iron
is hot. I think tomorrow will be fine.

182
00:11:41,560 --> 00:11:43,210
Clear this place tomorrow.

183
00:11:43,210 --> 00:11:45,690
It's time to shut your mouth…

184
00:11:47,930 --> 00:11:50,740
All right, I will make arrangements.

185
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:57,290
Why is he so insecure?

186
00:11:59,720 --> 00:12:00,860
Yes?

187
00:12:00,860 --> 00:12:02,190
Thank you,

188
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,610
for helping me hide the deletion of short messages.

189
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,400
What are you looking at?

190
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:13,030
What’s up?

191
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:22,560
What? Jin-woo?

192
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,060
Is that you, Jin-woo?

193
00:12:25,060 --> 00:12:26,190
Of course.

194
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:28,200
Can't I recognize Professor Do?

195
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,050
Who's he with?

196
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:32,610
It's an old man who looks familiar.

197
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,010
I think I've seen him in the news.

198
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:35,760
The news.

199
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,100
My brother is not involved in some
criminal case, right?

200
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,020
I don't think it's a crime.

201
00:12:40,020 --> 00:12:42,110
Is he a comedian?

202
00:12:42,110 --> 00:12:43,200
In any case,

203
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:45,140
he smells like money.

204
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,450
The smell of money…

205
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,790
Professor Do is said to be in Yeongpo.

206
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:55,350
What's this?

207
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:59,060
I'll ask Han Gye-jeol if she's seen him.

208
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:00,280
You can't.

209
00:13:01,870 --> 00:13:02,810
What are you doing?

210
00:13:02,810 --> 00:13:05,630
We can't contact Han Gye-jeol first.

211
00:13:05,630 --> 00:13:08,660
It's like she's desperately trying to get on
Professor Do now.

212
00:13:10,230 --> 00:13:12,220
What kind of threat can Han Gye-jeol be?

213
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,310
Give it to me!

214
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:14,260
Damn girl!

215
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:17,550
You're about to lose your boyfriend to
Han Gye-jeol.

216
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:20,130
What are you talking about?

217
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:21,640
Oh, what can I say.

218
00:13:31,280 --> 00:13:33,750
It's because he was wearing a mask.

219
00:13:33,750 --> 00:13:35,800
Take a closer look.

220
00:13:37,290 --> 00:13:38,650
You don’t find him here?

221
00:13:40,080 --> 00:13:41,250
Is that him?

222
00:13:41,980 --> 00:13:43,390
I don’t know.

223
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,640
That's strange.

224
00:14:03,380 --> 00:14:06,260
You're the one who applied for the security equipment, right?

225
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,250
Yes, I did.

226
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:10,820
There's no such person here??

227
00:14:10,820 --> 00:14:11,880
No.

228
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:15,460
I'll look for him again.

229
00:14:15,460 --> 00:14:17,310
Please come back to the police station in
a couple of days.

230
00:14:17,310 --> 00:14:18,700
Okay.

231
00:14:22,310 --> 00:14:23,580
Take care.

232
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,660
You've come so quickly.

233
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,580
I thought it would take a few more days.

234
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:35,190
If a female customer requests it,

235
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:36,500
we will come as soon as possible,

236
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,140
because we knew people would be upset.

237
00:14:45,280 --> 00:14:46,740
Done.

238
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:58,290
I don't think there's a pinhole camera in
here, right?

239
00:14:58,290 --> 00:15:00,290
The security cameras are installed
outside.

240
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:03,830
This is the window frame and door
electronic sensor alarm.

241
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:07,150
Because recently there are always said to
be found in this device pinhole camera.

242
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,770
I understand your concern.

243
00:15:09,770 --> 00:15:12,450
Do you want to try opening the outside
door?

244
00:15:12,450 --> 00:15:13,740
Yes.

245
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:50,580
As soon as the alarm goes off,

246
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,210
we'll be there.

247
00:15:52,210 --> 00:15:53,850
That's great.

248
00:15:56,080 --> 00:15:57,740
Why did you go there?

249
00:15:57,740 --> 00:15:59,300
She didn't recognize me at all.

250
00:15:59,300 --> 00:15:59,860
(Feiyun Clinic)
She didn't recognize me at all.

251
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,990
Only by confirming in person
(Feiyun Clinic)

252
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:03,860
can you continue to use me with
ease, right?
(Feiyun Clinic)

253
00:16:03,860 --> 00:16:04,700
can you continue to use me with
ease, right?

254
00:16:05,850 --> 00:16:07,580
What if Han Gye-jeol recognizes you?

255
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,730
What are you going to do then?

256
00:16:09,730 --> 00:16:10,770
If she does...

257
00:16:10,770 --> 00:16:14,100
You'll kill me so I can't talk, right?

258
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,710
I'm aware of that.

259
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:18,100
That's why I'm risking my life to make sure that,

260
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:20,850
and to prove to you that I'm not a useless piece,

261
00:16:20,850 --> 00:16:23,370
I'm still useful to you.

262
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,050
So?

263
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:26,730
What's the next step?

264
00:16:26,730 --> 00:16:29,490
I’ll find Bak Chung-seong and kill Han
Gye-jeol.

265
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:33,500
So please trust me once more, Mr.
Speaker.

266
00:16:49,890 --> 00:16:51,070
Lord Deity.

267
00:16:51,170 --> 00:16:52,990
Lord Deity.

268
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:59,680
Well, I got all the security footage from
the lighthouse.

269
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:01,620
I've asked the security team to check it
carefully.

270
00:17:01,620 --> 00:17:03,060
We should be able to catch the culprit
soon.

271
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:05,740
We need to find him as soon as possible,

272
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:08,030
and we have to find him before the police
do.

273
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:10,589
How dare he touches the woman of God?

274
00:17:10,589 --> 00:17:12,060
We can't let such a person fall into human
hands.

275
00:17:13,329 --> 00:17:14,460
Emmm, Lord Deity?

276
00:17:14,460 --> 00:17:15,710
Um.

277
00:17:15,710 --> 00:17:17,940
What are you doing?

278
00:17:17,940 --> 00:17:20,710
Oh, look at this.

279
00:17:20,710 --> 00:17:24,010
I should say that I like Alessandro
Michele's unisex clothing,

280
00:17:24,010 --> 00:17:28,119
or it reflects my masculinity.

281
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:30,270
Martin Margiela,

282
00:17:30,270 --> 00:17:32,570
this friend is really a genius,

283
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:34,440
very unique but not overt,

284
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:35,690
just like me.

285
00:17:35,690 --> 00:17:37,160
This degree is very difficult to grasp.

286
00:17:48,810 --> 00:17:50,180
Player Jeong I-deun,

287
00:17:50,180 --> 00:17:52,840
you are so humor.

288
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,860
That liar?

289
00:17:55,830 --> 00:17:59,430
Audience who lives in Okindon and his
nickname is "I'm dating a fairy" has
asked:

290
00:17:59,710 --> 00:18:02,430
When was your first kiss?

291
00:18:02,430 --> 00:18:04,080
How did you feel?

292
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:10,130
First kiss... You are so tricky.

293
00:18:12,090 --> 00:18:14,690
Of course, I remember the first kiss well.

294
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:15,670
How did I feel?

295
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:19,370
Like the feeling of the fifth season can be
the answer, I think?

296
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:21,730
The fifth season?

297
00:18:21,730 --> 00:18:22,960
The fifth season?

298
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:23,930
Yes,

299
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:27,950
it's like meeting a unique season in the
world.

300
00:18:28,910 --> 00:18:30,710
It's a wonderful feeling.

301
00:19:03,790 --> 00:19:07,450
Deity, deity, look, it's snowing.

302
00:19:07,450 --> 00:19:09,590
The weather seems to be changing a lot
this year.

303
00:19:09,590 --> 00:19:12,450
The sun is shining and it's snowing.

304
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:14,770
Just like the snowflakes in summer.

305
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,750
Like the fifth season.

306
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:20,630
It's like a new paradise.

307
00:19:22,330 --> 00:19:24,670
Her lips

308
00:19:25,590 --> 00:19:27,710
also fall on my place.

309
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:33,070
I'd like to introduce you to Nurse Seo Bok-gyeong.

310
00:19:33,070 --> 00:19:35,460
Hello, I'm Seo Bok-gyeong.

311
00:19:39,060 --> 00:19:40,150
Deity?

312
00:19:44,630 --> 00:19:46,460
Is there anything else you want to ask?

313
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:51,400
Well... His father was discharged from
the hospital after his cancer surgery.

314
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:54,980
But when he takes medicine, it seems to
get stuck in his throat...

315
00:19:57,090 --> 00:19:58,290
Kissing ulcers...

316
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:02,170
Kissing… Do you still get sick if you
kiss?

317
00:20:02,170 --> 00:20:05,010
As a doctor, you should have told me in
advance, Han Gye-jeol.

318
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:07,730
What is it? Is it a serious disease?

319
00:20:07,730 --> 00:20:08,990
How embarrassing.

320
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:14,560
It's caused by kissing hormone secretion.

321
00:20:14,560 --> 00:20:17,810
What's that? What do you secrete when
you kiss?

322
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,750
Is it bad?

323
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:22,770
-Is it good? - I'm going crazy.

324
00:20:22,770 --> 00:20:24,550
If it's more serious

325
00:20:24,550 --> 00:20:27,080
artificial disc herniation implantation is
needed.

326
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:30,430
This time you said the lips. I heard you
clearly.
("Implantation" and "lips" are
homophones)

327
00:20:30,430 --> 00:20:33,400
Oh, come on, stop messing around and
get out.

328
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:35,640
Don't give orders. Let's talk about it,
okay?

329
00:20:35,640 --> 00:20:36,960
Why don't you get out?

330
00:20:38,150 --> 00:20:41,300
I'm curious if you'll get sick if you kiss.

331
00:20:41,300 --> 00:20:43,480
You can ask what you're secreting.

332
00:20:43,480 --> 00:20:44,800
Quiet! Get out!

333
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,150
I told you that you said the lips.

334
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:03,380
Why are you doing this?

335
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:06,150
Like a very relaxed person.

336
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:08,460
You saw the way Han Gye-jeol looked at
me with anger?

337
00:21:08,460 --> 00:21:12,210
I saw it. Even if I met an old enemy for
hundreds of years, I wouldn't stare at him
so angrily.

338
00:21:12,210 --> 00:21:14,130
Not only that, she was screaming at me.

339
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,980
So, who was she yelling at like she ate a
firecracker?

340
00:21:16,980 --> 00:21:18,140
But she looks good.

341
00:21:18,140 --> 00:21:21,020
But she... What?

342
00:21:21,020 --> 00:21:25,510
She looks good even if she stares, even if
she shouts, even if her legs are swollen
after walking all day.

343
00:21:25,510 --> 00:21:28,010
She looks good even when she's soaked
with sweat, even with hair that clings like
a bumpkin.

344
00:21:28,010 --> 00:21:29,690
Oh my god!

345
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:33,960
It seems that the so-called disaster is because of Seol Hui,

346
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:36,650
although the war-like love is over, there
is still a fire bomb

347
00:21:36,650 --> 00:21:38,920
somewhere in the heart that hasn’t
exploded yet.

348
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:42,210
It even takes Han Gye-jeol as Seol Hui,
so it thumping.

349
00:21:42,210 --> 00:21:44,900
You said before that it does not matter
whether it is a past life or a kiss.

350
00:21:44,900 --> 00:21:47,070
Can you confess to her like this?

351
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:50,900
What does that have to do with this?

352
00:21:50,900 --> 00:21:53,290
If your confession is successful,

353
00:21:53,290 --> 00:21:56,200
Han Gye-jeol will say I love you,

354
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:59,670
then you will die and
be freed from the pain forever.

355
00:21:59,670 --> 00:22:02,200
But what about Han Gye-jeol?
She will be left alone,

356
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,390
and will be bound by the terrible pain.

357
00:22:04,390 --> 00:22:07,040
Can you bear her tears?

358
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:13,290
Gak Shin, do you know
what the privilege of the dead is?

359
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:16,800
That is, we are not obligated
to share the things of the living.

360
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:20,220
Han Gye-jeol’s tears are hers, not mine.

361
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:25,590
Really? I can’t believe in
your words anymore.

362
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:30,630
Just take more looks at my face more.
After tonight, you might not see me anymore.

363
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:44,220
Han Gye-jeol, what are you going
to do tonight? It’s a beautiful day...

364
00:22:44,220 --> 00:22:47,360
-Nurse Seo, let’s go. -Okay.

365
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:48,830
You are not the Meteorological Agency.

366
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:57,670
(The Dragon King's steaky pork)

367
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:00,430
(Gangbyeonbuk-Ro Song Festival)

368
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:07,370
Hello.

369
00:23:10,310 --> 00:23:12,860
Doctor, you’re younger than I thought.

370
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:15,750
But what’s wrong with you?

371
00:23:15,750 --> 00:23:19,730
It's not me, it's my husband.

372
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:24,930
♫My heart♫

373
00:23:27,070 --> 00:23:31,660
♫to the lost things♫

374
00:23:34,410 --> 00:23:38,890
♫to romance♫

375
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,370
I said I wanted to play the guitar
and spend the rest of my life relaxing.

376
00:23:54,370 --> 00:23:56,630
Why do you call the doctor?

377
00:23:57,670 --> 00:24:00,510
Although you say so,
you’re dressed up so much.

378
00:24:00,510 --> 00:24:03,170
You even put on a denim shirt
that you don’t wear much.

379
00:24:03,170 --> 00:24:05,910
The bronze award of Gangbyeonbuk-Ro Song Festival
should also be decent.

380
00:24:05,910 --> 00:24:08,370
Search the internet for
the Gangbyeonbuk-Ro Song Festival, Sim Hong-geun.

381
00:24:08,370 --> 00:24:11,440
He’s not bad looking.

382
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,510
How long are you going
to listen to him?

383
00:24:15,140 --> 00:24:17,200
Mr. Sim Hong-geun,
what’s wrong with you?

384
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,880
Today I feel good here,
tomorrow I feel bad there.

385
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:29,070
Isn’t the human body or life the same?

386
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:30,690
It doesn’t matter.

387
00:24:30,690 --> 00:24:33,110
Come on, since the doctor is here,

388
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:35,140
for my sake, say it.

389
00:24:39,490 --> 00:24:42,080
When did this start?

390
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:46,180
About a month ago,
when the nosebleed starts,

391
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:49,230
it won’t stop easily.

392
00:24:49,230 --> 00:24:52,750
And this cyan bruise.

393
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:02,350
It is said online that cyan bruise occurs
when there are fewer platelets.

394
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,630
It’s leukemia, right?

395
00:25:04,630 --> 00:25:08,900
I know everything I should know,
so please tell me the truth.

396
00:25:08,900 --> 00:25:11,080
How long can I live?

397
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:12,850
Stop saying such weak words.

398
00:25:12,850 --> 00:25:15,350
How can I live alone?

399
00:25:15,350 --> 00:25:17,700
Can I see the last leaf?

400
00:25:20,710 --> 00:25:23,160
Is the hair here so curved?

401
00:25:24,410 --> 00:25:26,880
When did this become like this?

402
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:27,770
Well,

403
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:29,210
is he in poor health?

404
00:25:30,950 --> 00:25:32,600
Do you eat a lot of meat?

405
00:25:34,330 --> 00:25:39,610
As you can see, Hong-geun is still young,
so he’s a picky eater.

406
00:25:39,610 --> 00:25:43,120
He loves drinking and always says
he can’t drink if he eats too much.

407
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,870
So he doesn’t like eating.

408
00:25:44,870 --> 00:25:47,420
Alcohol is also carbohydrate.
It’s high in calories.

409
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,750
If I eat anything else,
I’ll have a big belly,

410
00:25:49,750 --> 00:25:52,140
and can’t wear this kind of clothes anymore.

411
00:25:52,140 --> 00:25:54,260
What about kimchi or fruit?

412
00:25:54,260 --> 00:25:56,940
He hates sour food.

413
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:01,280
Although we need to check the blood
to know the exact result,

414
00:26:01,280 --> 00:26:03,030
in my opinion,

415
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,310
it seems to be scurvy.

416
00:26:12,580 --> 00:26:14,250
Scurvy?

417
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,890
Not leukemia?

418
00:26:17,890 --> 00:26:21,070
That means Hong-geun doesn’t
have a terminal disease, right?

419
00:26:21,070 --> 00:26:24,030
Yes, yes, of course.

420
00:26:24,030 --> 00:26:26,640
Because he doesn’t like eating
anything but wine,

421
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:30,200
and he smokes, so he’s not getting enough
vitamins.

422
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,130
I'll give you a vitamin supplement.

423
00:26:32,130 --> 00:26:34,440
You should eat something else.

424
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:36,790
And also try to smoke less.

425
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:38,590
It’s better if you can quit.

426
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,180
Of course I will quit!

427
00:26:40,180 --> 00:26:42,020
Such a beautiful doctor told me to quit.

428
00:26:42,020 --> 00:26:43,030
I’ll definitely quit!

429
00:26:48,830 --> 00:26:51,230
I’ll help you spread throughout Yeongpo.

430
00:26:51,230 --> 00:26:53,890
You’re like a female Heo Jun.

431
00:26:53,890 --> 00:26:54,990
Really?

432
00:26:54,990 --> 00:26:56,410
Thank you!

433
00:27:08,310 --> 00:27:09,710
Yeah

434
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:13,370
have you told her yet?

435
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,930
I'm going to tell her soon.

436
00:27:14,930 --> 00:27:17,470
What? How could you haven’t told her yet?

437
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:20,460
I tried my best to hire
the three-star Michelin chef.

438
00:27:20,460 --> 00:27:25,250
He's not the kind of person
who comes here every day to beg and sing.

439
00:27:25,250 --> 00:27:26,720
So noisy.

440
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:29,220
We’ll go there. Just go!

441
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:31,210
Prepare the most advanced.

442
00:27:31,210 --> 00:27:33,520
After all, it might be my last dinner.

443
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,410
You don't even know how much it cost.

444
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,220
Well, you're here.

445
00:27:47,270 --> 00:27:48,300
Han Gye-jeol,

446
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:50,180
What are you going to do tonight?

447
00:27:50,180 --> 00:27:52,030
Nothing.

448
00:27:52,030 --> 00:27:53,200
Good.

449
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:56,050
I have nothing to do either.
Let's have dinner together.

450
00:27:56,050 --> 00:27:58,690
Do you think I'm easy to bully?

451
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,940
Do you know how expensive my time is?

452
00:27:59,940 --> 00:28:01,320
How dare you take up my time?

453
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:03,550
I'm not interested in
how expensive your time is.

454
00:28:03,550 --> 00:28:05,860
I'm not trying to buy your time.

455
00:28:09,650 --> 00:28:14,130
Anyway, I don’t want to
spend time with you today.

456
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:15,050
See you next time.

457
00:28:15,050 --> 00:28:16,530
Next time? When?

458
00:28:16,530 --> 00:28:18,390
Next time.

459
00:28:18,390 --> 00:28:19,600
Whenever you want.

460
00:28:19,600 --> 00:28:20,620
Seo Bok-gyeong,

461
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:24,140
get out.

462
00:28:24,140 --> 00:28:25,050
Me?

463
00:28:25,050 --> 00:28:26,370
No, why did you

464
00:28:26,370 --> 00:28:27,720
ask my employee to get out?

465
00:28:27,720 --> 00:28:29,050
Can't you hear me telling you to get out?

466
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:31,820
I’ll get out now.

467
00:28:37,040 --> 00:28:38,500
Why are you so angry?

468
00:28:38,500 --> 00:28:40,010
You're not the one
who should be angry now.

469
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:45,740
There's always a time for everything,
Han Gye-jeol.

470
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,380
There is a time for the flowers, the snow,

471
00:28:48,380 --> 00:28:50,170
the heat of the summer night,

472
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:51,890
the breeze of autumn,

473
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:53,320
the love that has ended,

474
00:28:53,320 --> 00:28:55,240
or the new marriage.

475
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:58,450
People become unfortunate

476
00:29:00,010 --> 00:29:02,360
because they postpone such timing at will.

477
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,180
I have something to tell you
and something I want to hear from you.

478
00:29:07,180 --> 00:29:09,330
I've been waiting for a thousand years,

479
00:29:09,330 --> 00:29:11,960
so I'm sure it's not always the right time
to say it, and to hear it.

480
00:29:14,830 --> 00:29:17,250
All those times are now,

481
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:21,210
today.

482
00:29:34,120 --> 00:29:34,800
All right.

483
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,620
Let's meet after work.

484
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:43,870
I'll call you when I'm ready.

485
00:29:56,010 --> 00:29:57,360
What?

486
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:00,480
I was going to talk about the kiss later.

487
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,400
Hum.

488
00:30:06,040 --> 00:30:07,950
I thought I was going to be dumped.

489
00:30:07,950 --> 00:30:10,440
I almost lost my thousand years face.

490
00:30:11,500 --> 00:30:13,560
I can't propose again.

491
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:16,610
(Fire Fist Gymnasium)

492
00:30:16,610 --> 00:30:18,480
Han Gye-jeol!
(Fire Fist Gymnasium)

493
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,950
What did you say?

494
00:30:20,950 --> 00:30:22,260
Today,

495
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,120
you're dead.

496
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,530
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

497
00:30:24,530 --> 00:30:26,920
Hey, hey, hey.

498
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:28,760
Do you have any happy events today?

499
00:30:28,760 --> 00:30:29,970
Are you going to kill a pig?

500
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:30,710
What's wrong?

501
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:32,580
You’re in your state immediately.

502
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:34,520
You’re aggressive,
I feel like you’re going to hit people.

503
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,380
Almost.

504
00:30:38,380 --> 00:30:41,770
I need strength today.

505
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:46,150
Take a 15-minute break.

506
00:30:46,150 --> 00:30:47,020
Take a break.

507
00:30:51,210 --> 00:30:52,570
Please take some time out.

508
00:30:54,100 --> 00:30:57,120
I'm not in the mood to see a man today. Please go back.

509
00:30:57,120 --> 00:30:59,000
I'm not just a man. I'm a cop.

510
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:04,020
Isn't a cop a man?

511
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,290
What kind of life do you live

512
00:31:08,290 --> 00:31:10,670
that you have the illusion
every time we meet?

513
00:31:10,670 --> 00:31:14,390
If you get hit on by five
or more men a day...

514
00:31:14,390 --> 00:31:17,680
You're not that pretty.
I don't understand.

515
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:20,700
Usually, people only think about
that kind of rude comment.

516
00:31:20,700 --> 00:31:23,910
Usually, people only think about
that kind of shameless illusion.

517
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:24,820
Are you here to provoke me?

518
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:25,890
I'm here to investigate.

519
00:31:25,890 --> 00:31:26,970
Look,

520
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:29,610
these are all the people taken
by the hospital’s security footage that day.

521
00:31:29,610 --> 00:31:30,730
Which one?

522
00:31:32,270 --> 00:31:34,180
I can’t tell you for nothing, right?

523
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:38,400
But there's not enough money
for investigation.

524
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,900
Oh, really?

525
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:41,410
Then pay with your body.

526
00:31:45,060 --> 00:31:46,560
No, I don't mean that body.

527
00:31:46,560 --> 00:31:47,990
I'm a bit...

528
00:31:47,990 --> 00:31:49,570
Me too.

529
00:31:49,570 --> 00:31:51,790
Great. Then what?

530
00:31:51,790 --> 00:31:52,970
Come and fight with me.

531
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:01,030
You have mistaken because I look slim.

532
00:32:01,030 --> 00:32:03,900
But I've never lost in sports.

533
00:32:03,900 --> 00:32:07,630
As long as I compete, I'm the only one who can win...

534
00:32:10,050 --> 00:32:12,160
Yu A-in.

535
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:12,990
Okay, come on.

536
00:32:15,510 --> 00:32:17,280
Mr. Yu A-in.

537
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:20,150
I told you, if you win, I'll help you.

538
00:32:20,150 --> 00:32:21,790
But if I win,

539
00:32:21,790 --> 00:32:23,760
don't come to me again.

540
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:24,750
Deal.

541
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:30,990
21 hip bridges! 21 pull-ups!

542
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:33,260
Let's see who finishes first!

543
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,350
Don't let me win because I'm a girl.

544
00:32:37,350 --> 00:32:39,230
I have a sister at home.

545
00:32:39,230 --> 00:32:44,080
If I show mercy to a girl,
I would have crossed the Jordan already.

546
00:32:44,080 --> 00:32:46,150
Why crossing the Jordan?

547
00:32:46,150 --> 00:32:47,560
It should be the Jordan River.

548
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:54,270
(Yeongpo Police Station)

549
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:55,410
We've looked through all the security footage
and car logs.
(Yeongpo Police Station)

550
00:32:55,410 --> 00:32:57,650
We've looked through all the security footage
and car logs.

551
00:32:57,650 --> 00:32:59,540
None of them captured his face clearly.

552
00:32:59,540 --> 00:32:59,650
(Emergency Room)
None of them captured his face clearly.

553
00:32:59,650 --> 00:33:01,680
What's the use of finding it?
(Emergency Room)

554
00:33:01,680 --> 00:33:02,620
Put more pressure on the witnesses.
(Emergency Room)

555
00:33:02,620 --> 00:33:04,860
Put more pressure on the witnesses.

556
00:33:04,860 --> 00:33:07,270
They won't talk until
we have solid evidence.

557
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:10,800
After confirming the parking lot,
I'm going to expand the area to the alley.

558
00:33:18,770 --> 00:33:19,710
(Ambulance)

559
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:36,180
What's going on? That guy.

560
00:33:45,710 --> 00:33:46,680
Hello.

561
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,420
Wait.

562
00:33:49,420 --> 00:33:51,310
I'm Officer Han Chul
from Yeongpo Police Station.

563
00:34:01,870 --> 00:34:04,630
Why is there no suitable dress
in my closet?

564
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:09,520
I bought a dress last year,

565
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,210
which was cheap and pretty.

566
00:34:13,110 --> 00:34:14,929
It's gone.

567
00:34:14,929 --> 00:34:17,050
Hey, closet.

568
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:18,639
Did you eat my clothes?

569
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:19,659
Tell me the truth.

570
00:34:19,659 --> 00:34:20,790
You've eaten my clothes, right?

571
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:32,489
If I buy now,

572
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:38,820
when will it arrive?

573
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,330
I might as well meet him tomorrow.

574
00:34:45,719 --> 00:34:46,730
Express delivery?

575
00:34:49,139 --> 00:34:50,710
(Addressee Han Gye-jeol)

576
00:34:54,000 --> 00:34:55,949
I didn't place an order.

577
00:34:58,830 --> 00:34:59,840
What happened?

578
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:10,190
Have I already placed an order?

579
00:35:20,370 --> 00:35:21,360
So beautiful.

580
00:35:46,150 --> 00:35:47,990
Remember

581
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:49,240
the wind,

582
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:51,590
people,

583
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,000
the world and the universe,

584
00:35:55,890 --> 00:35:58,970
and one night for you.

585
00:36:49,360 --> 00:36:50,930
I can't be late.

586
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:57,010
(Empty)

587
00:37:08,790 --> 00:37:09,760
What?

588
00:37:17,790 --> 00:37:19,160
Thank you.

589
00:37:50,540 --> 00:37:52,510
Strange.

590
00:37:52,510 --> 00:37:54,620
The street lights here

591
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:56,740
were broken a long time ago.

592
00:37:56,740 --> 00:37:59,030
The road here was dark and dangerous.

593
00:37:59,030 --> 00:38:01,510
Today, all these lights are on.

594
00:38:01,510 --> 00:38:04,020
You seem to be very lucky.

595
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,980
Although you're just being polite,

596
00:38:08,980 --> 00:38:10,440
I'm really happy.

597
00:38:10,440 --> 00:38:12,280
I can tell from the first glance that

598
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,080
people like you

599
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,310
have good luck in everything.

600
00:38:16,310 --> 00:38:17,390
I'm serious.

601
00:38:17,390 --> 00:38:18,690
Really?

602
00:38:18,690 --> 00:38:20,070
Thank you.

603
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:47,260
Come on. Everybody, get ready.

604
00:38:47,260 --> 00:38:48,330
They're coming.

605
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,890
Lord Deity, Lord Deity,

606
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:53,900
how is it?

607
00:38:53,900 --> 00:38:55,100
And the music.

608
00:38:56,310 --> 00:38:58,160
Good, good.

609
00:38:58,160 --> 00:38:59,300
Thank you for your hard work.

610
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,360
She'll be here soon.

611
00:39:03,360 --> 00:39:04,810
Okay.

612
00:39:04,810 --> 00:39:06,420
Don't run! Don't run!

613
00:39:06,420 --> 00:39:07,570
She's here.

614
00:39:07,570 --> 00:39:08,690
Hurry.

615
00:39:09,930 --> 00:39:10,840
She's here!

616
00:39:10,840 --> 00:39:11,960
Okay.

617
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:13,960
Come on.

618
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:33,460
Jin-woo.

619
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:39,680
What?

620
00:39:47,770 --> 00:39:48,920
What's going on?

621
00:39:50,940 --> 00:39:52,920
I said I'm sorry.

622
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:55,140
I said it was all my fault.

623
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,950
No matter how angry you are,

624
00:39:56,950 --> 00:39:59,930
how come I can't get in touch with you?

625
00:39:59,930 --> 00:40:01,010
Do you want to die?

626
00:40:10,660 --> 00:40:13,530
-Stop, stop. -What's wrong?

627
00:40:13,580 --> 00:40:14,870
Evacuate! Evacuate!

628
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,610
Evacuate!

629
00:40:15,610 --> 00:40:16,440
Come on, hurry up!

630
00:40:16,440 --> 00:40:17,670
Evacuate!

631
00:40:22,110 --> 00:40:24,010
Bastard!

632
00:40:25,250 --> 00:40:27,500
Oops.

633
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,310
Tae Jeong-won.

634
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:44,380
You know I am looking for Jin-woo.

635
00:40:44,380 --> 00:40:47,180
How could you not contact me?

636
00:40:47,180 --> 00:40:48,770
That's...

637
00:40:54,630 --> 00:40:56,650
There's a reason.

638
00:40:56,650 --> 00:41:00,240
What reason?

639
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:03,540
Are you trying to seduce him
behind my back?

640
00:41:03,540 --> 00:41:05,860
Rude girl.

641
00:41:05,860 --> 00:41:08,660
Who are you? Why are you so annoying?

642
00:41:08,660 --> 00:41:11,110
Jin-woo?

643
00:41:11,110 --> 00:41:14,640
Who are you? Who are you to kill people
with your words?

644
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:17,100
Don’t talk nonsense again.

645
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:20,520
I'll let you know what kind of gods
you've offended tonight.

646
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,380
Jin-woo, what are you talking about?

647
00:41:25,060 --> 00:41:27,980
Why are you so cruel to me?

648
00:41:27,980 --> 00:41:29,930
Jeong-won.

649
00:41:31,600 --> 00:41:37,210
Professor Do, he's lost his memory.

650
00:41:37,210 --> 00:41:39,070
Let's get out of here.

651
00:41:39,070 --> 00:41:43,000
It seems that today is not the right time.

652
00:41:44,700 --> 00:41:46,370
Mr. Deity.

653
00:41:46,370 --> 00:41:49,380
Mr. Deity, wait.

654
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:53,340
I have something to tell her.

655
00:41:53,340 --> 00:41:54,610
Say it later.

656
00:41:54,610 --> 00:41:56,200
I asked you out first today.

657
00:41:56,200 --> 00:42:00,630
If it comes in order, she asked me out first.

658
00:42:01,460 --> 00:42:03,610
I'll wait for you ahead.

659
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:07,820
Go home and wait for me. I'll call you.

660
00:42:09,210 --> 00:42:14,830
I can't help it because I'm the one
who has to lose to you.

661
00:42:25,270 --> 00:42:26,230
What?

662
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:28,510
Amnesia? Dissociative dyslexia?

663
00:42:28,510 --> 00:42:30,080
How could you keep these things
from me until now?

664
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:33,530
You said he was mentally ill,
but you didn't treat him?

665
00:42:33,530 --> 00:42:36,320
He's lost his memory,
so we have to wait.

666
00:42:36,320 --> 00:42:37,830
As a doctor, you know this well, right?

667
00:42:37,830 --> 00:42:41,740
So you went along with what the patient
said and treated him?

668
00:42:41,740 --> 00:42:42,730
How could?

669
00:42:42,730 --> 00:42:43,810
What else could it be?

670
00:42:43,810 --> 00:42:46,770
Even if you do that,
you want to keep him with you, right?

671
00:42:46,770 --> 00:42:48,530
I can understand that.

672
00:42:48,530 --> 00:42:52,210
You think that the unreachable,
unattainable Do Jin-woo

673
00:42:52,210 --> 00:42:55,440
has fallen so far to your side, right?

674
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:59,410
But you can't seduce a man like that.

675
00:43:00,450 --> 00:43:04,320
Are you dizzy lately?
Don't you know it?

676
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:08,300
I'm not seducing him,
but Professor Do is seducing me.

677
00:43:10,510 --> 00:43:14,950
You've got it all wrong. Whenever a man
talks to you, you think he likes you.

678
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:18,430
You've learned your lesson before.
You should wake up.

679
00:43:18,430 --> 00:43:21,550
Do you think all men like you?

680
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:25,720
There are men who like me.
There are always men who like me.

681
00:43:25,720 --> 00:43:28,470
Fine, but that man will never be Jin-woo.

682
00:43:28,470 --> 00:43:29,340
Don't be so sure.

683
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:32,070
I can say that because
we're already dating.

684
00:43:32,070 --> 00:43:33,310
What?

685
00:43:33,310 --> 00:43:35,530
I met him when I was studying in America.

686
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:38,910
As soon as he solves his mother's problem,
we planned to go back to America together.

687
00:43:38,910 --> 00:43:40,730
Don't you know that?

688
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,850
Not at all.

689
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:46,150
Are you disappointed?

690
00:43:46,150 --> 00:43:50,630
What should I do? I'm sorry for you too.

691
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:55,300
Give me Jin-woo's number,
and don't contact him again.

692
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,300
No.

693
00:43:59,300 --> 00:44:02,150
No? What?

694
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:05,420
As you said, I like Professor Do.

695
00:44:05,420 --> 00:44:07,090
So I can't let go.

696
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:09,250
Can't you hear that
I'm already dating him?

697
00:44:09,250 --> 00:44:12,560
The reason why people have two ears
is to let people listen to the both sides.

698
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,120
Professor Do has amnesia, can I only
believe what you say?

699
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:18,720
I've never heard of your relationship.

700
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,850
Do you want me to show
proof of our relationship?

701
00:44:20,850 --> 00:44:23,290
If you have.

702
00:44:37,580 --> 00:44:39,770
Why is there only a group photo?

703
00:44:40,840 --> 00:44:42,990
Why have you become so childish?

704
00:44:42,990 --> 00:44:45,580
Because I know you too well.

705
00:44:45,580 --> 00:44:48,140
You can tell any lie if you have to.

706
00:44:48,140 --> 00:44:51,780
Are you doing it because of Jeong I-deun?

707
00:44:51,780 --> 00:44:53,730
It's been so long ago, you're still...

708
00:44:53,730 --> 00:44:57,840
I can trust you again, after all,
it's been so long.

709
00:44:57,840 --> 00:44:59,120
So keep it for now.

710
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,450
Keep it, what does it mean to keep it?

711
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:03,700
When Professor Do's memory
comes back, let’s judge then,

712
00:45:03,700 --> 00:45:07,560
whether to believe what you say
or decide to like him, all this.

713
00:45:07,560 --> 00:45:11,090
Are you going to take this to relieve me,

714
00:45:11,090 --> 00:45:14,540
and then try to seduce him?

715
00:45:16,980 --> 00:45:21,460
Yes, you could have done that if it was you.

716
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:26,070
But I'm not you, how can I do something
so unconscionable?

717
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:42,280
He’s the one who disappeared
for a week first, okay?

718
00:45:42,280 --> 00:45:44,760
You know how angry I am, right?

719
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:46,050
Yes, of course.

720
00:45:46,050 --> 00:45:47,920
So I lost my temper,

721
00:45:47,920 --> 00:45:49,780
I said I wanted to break up,

722
00:45:49,780 --> 00:45:54,380
then could he not answer my calls?

723
00:45:57,830 --> 00:46:01,060
Does he not like me anymore?

724
00:46:01,060 --> 00:46:05,110
If I apologize first, will he forgive me?

725
00:46:05,110 --> 00:46:07,980
Are you crazy?

726
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:12,710
It's Jeong I-deun's fault. Why do you feel sorry for him?

727
00:46:12,710 --> 00:46:17,840
Don't you know that once a woman bows her head, she can't hold it up forever?

728
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,660
You can’t contact him first.

729
00:46:19,660 --> 00:46:22,530
Must wait until he contacts you first.

730
00:46:22,530 --> 00:46:26,050
But I-deun might be too busy.

731
00:46:26,050 --> 00:46:29,870
Or maybe he got hurt somewhere.

732
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,680
Am I pushing him too hard?

733
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,590
He was already too busy to go to the US for the PGA.

734
00:46:36,590 --> 00:46:41,500
Let me contact him?

735
00:46:41,500 --> 00:46:42,850
You?

736
00:46:42,850 --> 00:46:47,060
Yes, I won't mention you, just asking how he's doing.

737
00:46:47,060 --> 00:46:48,590
Really?

738
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:49,090
Yes.

739
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:56,460
Thank you so much for helping me
contact him, Jeong-won!

740
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:58,440
-Don’t be like that. -Thank you!

741
00:46:58,440 --> 00:46:59,940
Are you drunk from a Coke?

742
00:46:59,940 --> 00:47:01,400
-Yep. -I got it.

743
00:47:01,400 --> 00:47:04,300
You kept saying you wanted to help me, then seduced your friend's boyfriend?

744
00:47:04,300 --> 00:47:09,750
I'm not cunning enough to do something
like your back stabbing.

745
00:47:09,750 --> 00:47:13,660
Yeah, you’re not like me.

746
00:47:13,660 --> 00:47:16,980
So you can't do that shameless thing, can you?

747
00:47:16,980 --> 00:47:20,620
I can’t! Absolutely not!

748
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:25,710
Don't say absolutely so easily.

749
00:47:25,710 --> 00:47:30,890
Sometimes, you have no other options.

750

(Mr. Deity)

751
00:47:45,250 --> 00:47:46,640
It’s Mr.Deity. How can I believe his words?
(Mr. Deity)

752
00:47:46,640 --> 00:47:54,030
It’s Mr.Deity. How can I believe his words?

753
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,420
Even if you do that,
you want to keep him with you, right?

754
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:00,130
I can understand that.

755
00:48:00,130 --> 00:48:03,830
You think that the unreachable,
unattainable Do Jin-woo

756
00:48:03,830 --> 00:48:08,210
has fallen so far to your side, right?

757
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:13,800
I had feelings for someone who was sick.

758
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:17,040
Tae Jeong-won, you can really speak.

759
00:48:17,040 --> 00:48:19,210
So annoying.

760
00:48:21,740 --> 00:48:25,090
So annoying!

761
00:48:32,300 --> 00:48:37,990
There is a bad spell in the sentence
of waiting for me.

762
00:48:41,930 --> 00:48:48,170
Those who say that will forget
the way they came from.

763
00:48:52,620 --> 00:48:58,880
Those who hear that will forget
the way back.

Didn't you say call me?

766
00:49:27,730 --> 00:49:28,680
Did you wait for me?

767
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,090
Yes, I did, for a long time.

768
00:49:31,090 --> 00:49:35,130
Sorry, I didn't expect to talk for so long.

Never mind. We can reschedule.

You’ve already asked?
Why are you that diligent?

775
00:49:53,840 --> 00:49:57,190
There's a lot of people waiting in line
for a brain MRI.

It’s my fault, sorry.

Why do you suddenly say that?

783
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:14,530
Why did you change your attitude?

784
00:50:14,530 --> 00:50:15,830
I didn’t.

I'm the same as yesterday.

How could it be possible?

788

It's you humans that get old and unpredictable.

I can't change even if I want to.

790

I thought you just lost your memory.
I didn't expect you to lose your morals, too.

What do you mean?

792

I thought you were just rich.
I didn't expect you to have a girlfriend.

What?

794
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:41,210
Girlfriend.

we can't step out, right?

809
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:25,220
I once asked the priest about it
after drinking.

810
00:51:25,220 --> 00:51:28,830
It seems that the Creator really likes you
so that you can be alive until now.

811
00:51:28,830 --> 00:51:33,100
I... can't be considered cheating.

812
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:35,130
I don't even remember who I dated.

813
00:51:35,130 --> 00:51:37,180
I have no memory, how can you say
it's cheating?

814
00:51:37,180 --> 00:51:39,270
Then get back the memory first.

815
00:51:39,270 --> 00:51:41,270
It's not my memory, how can I find it?

816
00:51:41,270 --> 00:51:43,790
Are you asking me to go to the
underworld for Do Jin-woo?

817
00:51:43,790 --> 00:51:47,370
-Whatever. -What?

818
00:51:47,370 --> 00:51:49,470
So...

819
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:51,120
Let's keep our distance

820
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:54,760
before you recover your memory.

821
00:52:10,510 --> 00:52:11,480
What?

822
00:52:11,480 --> 00:52:13,830
Keep distance?

823
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:16,800
Is she spoiled by being
cared about by God?

824
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:20,710
Well, gods have pride too,
we won't bow our heads first.

825
00:52:20,710 --> 00:52:23,830
All right...

826
00:52:26,490 --> 00:52:29,850
Damn!

827
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:32,380
(Han Gye-jeol)

828
00:52:35,810 --> 00:52:38,330
Only listen to me.

829
00:52:38,330 --> 00:52:40,980
We make phone calls every night is kind of...

830
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:44,690
Keep your distance on the phone... Bye.

831
00:52:48,600 --> 00:52:51,670
Hello...Hello?

832
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,840
What’s your attitude?

833
00:52:56,840 --> 00:53:00,360
Looks like I should ban phone calls
at night.

834
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:05,930
What?

835
00:53:05,930 --> 00:53:08,980
He's going to apologize...

836
00:53:11,510 --> 00:53:11,710
(Jeong I-deun: Have you slept?)

837
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:13,060
Went to bed?
(Jeong I-deun: Have you slept?)

838
00:53:13,060 --> 00:53:16,360
Jeong... Jeong I-deun. Crazy?

839
00:53:16,360 --> 00:53:18,540
Went...to bed?

840
00:53:18,540 --> 00:53:21,050
Went to bed?

841
00:53:21,050 --> 00:53:23,000
The law should forbid saying that.

842
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,410
Saying went to bed to who?

843
00:53:24,410 --> 00:53:26,340
What if I didn’t?
Do you want to come out and fight?

844
00:53:26,340 --> 00:53:27,050
(Jeong I-deun: Have you slept?)
What if I didn’t?
Do you want to come out and fight?

845
00:53:27,340 --> 00:53:27,610
Can I call you if you didn’t?

846
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:28,930
(Jeong I-deun: Have you slept? If you
haven’t, can I call you?)
Can I call you if you didn’t?

847
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:30,090
Can I call you if you didn’t?

848
00:53:31,450 --> 00:53:33,650
Crazy?

849
00:53:34,130 --> 00:53:36,210
I should call the police.

850
00:53:42,060 --> 00:53:43,650
(Jeong I-deun)

851
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,790
Damn!

852
00:53:48,570 --> 00:53:50,250
What do you want?

853
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:53,720
Please, help me.

854
00:54:28,250 --> 00:54:32,170
Patients who have undergone fracture
surgery should go to the hospital if he has a fever.

855
00:54:33,800 --> 00:54:37,700
What if the surgery site becomes
infected and causes sepsis?

856
00:54:41,220 --> 00:54:47,240
He was fine yesterday, but today he had
a fever and suddenly passed out.

857
00:54:48,510 --> 00:54:51,120
How about calling 119 now?

858
00:54:59,070 --> 00:55:01,160
Is it okay?

859
00:55:05,570 --> 00:55:08,070
What is the reason for doing this?

860
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:11,120
It seems that the company where
Chung-seong works has corruption issues.

861
00:55:11,120 --> 00:55:14,450
He went to a doctor with evidence of corruption.

862
00:55:14,450 --> 00:55:17,490
It’s heard the doctor is missing.

863
00:55:18,650 --> 00:55:21,230
Seeing this, he felt scared, so he hid.

864
00:55:21,230 --> 00:55:22,960
What company is it?

865
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,140
It's like a health checkup center.

866
00:55:27,140 --> 00:55:29,630
He didn't say in detail.

867
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:33,660
So is he going to hide like this
for the rest of his life?

868
00:55:33,660 --> 00:55:36,500
Ask him to surrender no matter what.

869
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,980
Call me if there is any problem.

870
00:55:48,980 --> 00:55:52,310
I will... only when there is really
no other way.

871
00:55:55,110 --> 00:55:57,230
Thank you.

872
00:55:59,850 --> 00:56:03,560
I know I shouldn't be contacting you,
but there's no way...

873
00:56:03,560 --> 00:56:05,320
This is what you are good at.

874
00:56:05,320 --> 00:56:07,380
Doing something that you know
you should not do.

875
00:56:07,380 --> 00:56:12,320
At that time... I was really sorry for you.

876
00:56:12,320 --> 00:56:13,960
I’ve wanted to apologize many times...

877
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,750
Someone once said

878
00:56:15,750 --> 00:56:18,020
everything has its time.

879
00:56:18,020 --> 00:56:19,410
An apology has its time, too.

880
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:22,050
Missed time is just an excuse.

881
00:56:22,050 --> 00:56:24,960
A bad excuse.

882
00:56:26,070 --> 00:56:29,440
It's late, let me get you home.

883
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:31,300
Seriously?

884
00:56:31,300 --> 00:56:32,450
All right.

885
00:56:32,450 --> 00:56:34,230
Your boyfriend will not
be happy about this.

886
00:56:34,230 --> 00:56:35,860
Boyfriend?

887
00:56:35,860 --> 00:56:39,200
You don’t have a boyfriend?

888
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:43,350
Why are you curious about it?

889
00:56:44,550 --> 00:56:47,290
I've always cared about this.

890
00:56:47,290 --> 00:56:52,730
I'm worried you got hurt because of me
and not be able to have a relationship with others.

891
00:56:59,240 --> 00:57:02,550
Do you think I’m ridiculous?

892
00:57:02,550 --> 00:57:06,740
My boyfriend is a doctor.

893
00:57:06,740 --> 00:57:09,360
The youngest head of the corporate
planning department at Seoul Pilseong Hospital.

894
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:13,140
Graduated from a university in the USA
where you’ve been dreaming of.

895
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:16,260
Johns Hopkins, ever heard of it?

896
00:57:16,260 --> 00:57:20,270
And he's also very handsome.

897
00:57:20,270 --> 00:57:22,380
Ah, the ambiguous man from before.

898
00:57:22,380 --> 00:57:25,190
It's him, right?

899
00:57:34,220 --> 00:57:38,400
Damn! Why mentioned the boyfriend?

900
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:03,120
Can you not break up with me?

901
00:58:09,960 --> 00:58:12,220
That’s enough.

902
00:58:17,860 --> 00:58:23,590
Don’t go, please.

903
00:58:23,590 --> 00:58:25,440
I don’t care even if you cheated on me.

904
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:29,860
But could you not break up with me?

905
00:58:32,580 --> 00:58:36,560
Don’t leave me, I’ll take care of you.

906
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,480
I’ll do better.

907
00:58:40,480 --> 00:58:44,600
Don’t continue to be useless.

908
00:58:49,010 --> 00:58:51,390
What a fool.

909
00:58:52,080 --> 00:58:56,060
I'm not smart enough to gossip about
people like you.

910
00:58:56,060 --> 00:58:59,370
Never. Absolutely not.

911
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:03,390
Don't say absolutely so easily.

912
00:59:03,390 --> 00:59:08,520
Life is all about things like that
happening all of a sudden.

913
00:59:14,690 --> 00:59:18,900
Well, it’s not like saying he’s
my boyfriend everywhere.

914
00:59:18,900 --> 00:59:23,360
This shouldn't count as gossip, right?

915
00:59:24,250 --> 00:59:26,030
No...

916
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:57,040
Hello.

917
00:59:57,040 --> 00:59:58,550
Ah... you are having meal.

918
00:59:58,550 --> 01:00:00,270
I’ll come back later.

919
01:00:00,270 --> 01:00:02,600
No need, I’m done eating.

920
01:00:02,600 --> 01:00:05,200
What do you want to eat?
Pork belly or fresh fish?

921
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:08,580
A miso porridge, please.

922
01:00:12,970 --> 01:00:15,620
Oops, you always eat porridge recently.

923
01:00:15,620 --> 01:00:17,850
What's the matter? Digestion problem?

924
01:00:17,850 --> 01:00:19,710
I like porridge.

925
01:00:20,370 --> 01:00:24,730
If you only eat porridge, you will
get scurvy caused by a partial eclipse.

926
01:00:24,730 --> 01:00:26,760
I heard that you were reprimanded
by Doctor Han Gye-jeol.

927
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,130
You are sober now.

928
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:30,320
Sister.

929
01:00:33,480 --> 01:00:35,460
You are eating kimchi that
you never touched before.

930
01:00:35,460 --> 01:00:36,530
I told you the disease was not a big deal.

931
01:00:36,530 --> 01:00:38,990
Shake a leg, hurry up and get me
some miso porridge.

932
01:00:38,990 --> 01:00:40,510
Oh my.

933
01:00:43,130 --> 01:00:46,580
I think that woman is a bit pretentious.

934
01:00:46,580 --> 01:00:46,590
(The Dragon King's steaky pork)
I think that woman is a bit pretentious.

935
01:00:46,590 --> 01:00:48,280
What? I think she is quite naive.
(The Dragon King's steaky pork)

936
01:00:48,280 --> 01:00:50,040
What? I think she is quite naive.

937
01:00:50,040 --> 01:00:53,600
Don't you know that the naivest cat
goes to the pot first?

938
01:00:53,600 --> 01:00:54,990
What are you saying?

939
01:00:54,990 --> 01:00:57,940
She cured your husband,
but you are not grateful at all.

940
01:00:57,940 --> 01:00:59,490
Sis, please.

941
01:00:59,490 --> 01:01:02,510
In such a small village,
a woman as young as her smiles all day long.

942
01:01:02,510 --> 01:01:04,410
Sooner or later there will be problems.

943
01:01:04,410 --> 01:01:07,560
-She saw Hong-geun and touched him like this.
-Let go.

944
01:01:07,560 --> 01:01:09,600
With smile.

945
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:11,390
I really...

946
01:01:11,390 --> 01:01:13,760
Doctor Han is not that kind of person.

947
01:01:13,760 --> 01:01:17,170
Jeong, do you know Dr. Han?

948
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:18,890
Yes.

949
01:01:18,890 --> 01:01:20,090
What’s your relationship?

950
01:01:20,090 --> 01:01:23,310
Why can't you even listen to a single gossip?

951
01:01:23,310 --> 01:01:26,440
Well...just knowing each other.

952
01:01:27,080 --> 01:01:27,850
(The Dragon King's steaky pork)

953
01:01:27,850 --> 01:01:28,990
This kind of relationship means
a relationship with sex.
(The Dragon King's steaky pork)

954
01:01:28,990 --> 01:01:29,850
This kind of relationship means
a relationship with sex.

955
01:01:29,850 --> 01:01:31,470
-Sexual relationship... -You.

956
01:01:31,470 --> 01:01:33,740
Shut up.

957
01:01:33,740 --> 01:01:35,730
She has a boyfriend.

958
01:01:35,730 --> 01:01:38,680
It's rude that you say it everywhere.

959
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,180
-Boyfriend? -Boyfriend?

960
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:41,320
Yes.

961
01:01:41,320 --> 01:01:44,060
A capable and handsome doctor.

962
01:01:44,060 --> 01:01:45,570
Right.

963
01:01:45,570 --> 01:01:49,590
The man who has always been with her
is her boyfriend.

964
01:01:49,590 --> 01:01:50,550
What?

965
01:02:04,780 --> 01:02:08,550
Is everyone here for medical treatment?

966
01:02:08,550 --> 01:02:10,820
Anyway, you liar!

967
01:02:10,820 --> 01:02:12,030
I have said that I don't want to see you again.

968
01:02:12,030 --> 01:02:12,520
(Director, Han Gye-jeol)
I have said that I don't want to see you again.

969
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:13,630
But you are really disobedient.
(Director, Han Gye-jeol)

970
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:14,310
But you are really disobedient.

971
01:02:16,910 --> 01:02:20,220
Because the elders have been urging me
to go out with you.

972
01:02:20,220 --> 01:02:23,610
I have always listened to my elders.

973
01:02:23,610 --> 01:02:25,840
Really?

974
01:02:25,840 --> 01:02:29,260
That was the person she used to know.

975
01:02:29,260 --> 01:02:33,030
This is the person she knows now.

976
01:02:33,030 --> 01:02:35,990
Is this the hospital where love blooms?

977
01:02:48,420 --> 01:02:50,470
Are you not answering the phone?

978
01:02:50,470 --> 01:02:50,810
(Director, Han Gye-jeol)
Are you not answering the phone?

979
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:52,430
No, the call will automatically be
transferred to Han Gye-jeol’s phone.
(Director, Han Gye-jeol)

980
01:02:52,430 --> 01:02:53,590
That’s how it works.

981
01:02:53,590 --> 01:02:55,710
She worked so hard out there.

982
01:02:55,710 --> 01:02:57,680
It’s not reasonable you are still
asking her to answer the phone.

983
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,220
But I know nothing.

984
01:02:59,220 --> 01:03:01,550
I would make the matter worse
if I said something wrong.

985
01:03:01,550 --> 01:03:02,730
Stop shouting!

986
01:03:02,730 --> 01:03:04,590
Are you proud of this?

987
01:03:04,590 --> 01:03:07,100
If you know nothing, you should
work hard to learn.

988
01:03:07,100 --> 01:03:08,200
That’s right.

989
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,140
Being her boyfriend, you should help her
with these things.

990
01:03:11,990 --> 01:03:13,250
Boyfriend?

991
01:03:16,610 --> 01:03:18,190
Hello.

992
01:03:21,020 --> 01:03:22,790
What's wrong with you?

993
01:03:22,790 --> 01:03:27,070
Living with someone who can't
even answer the phone.

994
01:03:27,070 --> 01:03:27,940
What?

995
01:03:27,940 --> 01:03:30,790
Sister, please, she just got back from work.

996
01:03:30,790 --> 01:03:31,720
Come and sit down.

997
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:34,420
Come. Sit down.

998
01:03:37,830 --> 01:03:39,680
Take a seat.

999
01:03:43,510 --> 01:03:45,550
I have a sad feeling.

1000
01:03:45,550 --> 01:03:48,220
What does your boyfriend do?

1001
01:03:48,220 --> 01:03:50,360
Has he prepared a house in Seoul?

1002
01:03:50,360 --> 01:03:52,290
Are his parents still alive?

1003
01:03:52,290 --> 01:03:53,340
What?

1004
01:03:53,340 --> 01:03:55,740
Ask one by one...

1005
01:03:55,740 --> 01:03:59,740
When you see a young man you're like... Whoops.

1006
01:03:59,740 --> 01:04:00,960
Whose boyfriend?

1007
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,650
Me.

1008
01:04:02,650 --> 01:04:06,860
Your boyfriend who respects boundaries.

1009
01:04:06,860 --> 01:04:10,980
Why sad feelings are never wrong?

1010
01:04:29,640 --> 01:04:30,800
Speaking of...

1011
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:33,330
Professor Do Jin-woo.

1012
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,450
Do Jin-woo?

1013
01:04:34,450 --> 01:04:37,850
Graduated from Johns Hopkins University in the USA.

1014
01:04:37,850 --> 01:04:39,670
You all know Johns Hopkins, right?

1015
01:04:39,670 --> 01:04:42,910
Oh, I only heard it on TV.

1016
01:04:42,910 --> 01:04:44,920
It's the first time I've seen someone
who graduated from that university for real.

1017
01:04:47,190 --> 01:04:50,380
He once worked in Seoul Pilseong Hospital,
one of the three major hospitals in South Korea.

1018
01:04:50,380 --> 01:04:54,160
He was the youngest head of
the corporate planning department.

1019
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:54,980
And,

1020
01:04:54,980 --> 01:04:58,800
he also won the youngest doctor award
last year.

1021
01:04:58,800 --> 01:05:02,460
It is said that it is an award
given to only one person every year.

1022
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:06,240
Why showing off with those?

1023
01:05:08,940 --> 01:05:12,920
I just want to say that I am no longer
the useless Han Gye-jeol.

1024
01:05:12,920 --> 01:05:17,270
But such a man can't answer a single phone call.

1025
01:05:17,270 --> 01:05:19,250
Lazy...lazy.

1026
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:20,840
Lazy...

1027
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,380
Well.

1028
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,410
It’s me.

1029
01:05:23,410 --> 01:05:24,870
I didn't let him answer the phone.

1030
01:05:24,870 --> 01:05:30,200
Let him answer the phone only.
That is to make our professors overqualified.

1031
01:05:30,200 --> 01:05:31,800
Stop.

1032
01:05:33,550 --> 01:05:35,240
I’m not Do Jin-woo.

1033
01:05:38,230 --> 01:05:40,000
Professor Do.

1034
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:42,130
What’s the matter?

1035
01:05:42,130 --> 01:05:44,060
I lost my memory just as Han Gye-jeol wished.

1036
01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:46,820
I don't know Do Jin-woo.

1037
01:05:46,820 --> 01:05:49,000
Oh my god.

1038
01:05:49,000 --> 01:05:51,000
That’s why I can’t answer the phone.

1039
01:05:51,000 --> 01:05:55,290
Currently no job, no house in Seoul, and no parents.

1040
01:05:55,290 --> 01:05:58,150
I really didn't expect such a secret.

1041
01:05:58,150 --> 01:06:02,130
The more I look at our Dr. Han,
the more she looks like a Bodhisattva.

1042
01:06:02,130 --> 01:06:03,650
She really is a Bodhisattva.

1043
01:06:03,650 --> 01:06:05,270
Speaking of our Han Gye-jeol,

1044
01:06:05,270 --> 01:06:08,800
she probably doesn’t know Bodhisattva's
full name is Gautama Siddhartha until now.

1045
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:11,980
She doesn't know whether the person who drank the skull water Master Won Hyo or Gandhi?

1046
01:06:11,980 --> 01:06:13,820
Why do you suddenly say
she is a Bodhisattva?

1047
01:06:13,820 --> 01:06:15,650
Why?

1048
01:06:15,650 --> 01:06:19,290
Because she met a person who does nothing.

1049
01:06:19,290 --> 01:06:20,220
What?

1050
01:06:20,220 --> 01:06:21,400
Doing nothing?

1051
01:06:21,400 --> 01:06:23,900
What you mean? Are you saying I’m the person?

1052
01:06:23,900 --> 01:06:25,320
Well,

1053
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:26,800
Han Gye-jeol, say it yourself,

1054
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,240
about how amazing I am.

1055
01:06:28,240 --> 01:06:30,590
Tell them yourself how amazing I am.

1056
01:06:30,590 --> 01:06:32,580
If I start now...

1057
01:06:32,580 --> 01:06:36,540
Look at your questioning eyes, this is not good.

1058
01:06:55,670 --> 01:06:56,940
What's wrong with you?

1059
01:06:58,000 --> 01:06:59,510
Seriously?

1060
01:06:59,510 --> 01:07:02,140
Because I'm in a bad mood.

1061
01:07:03,830 --> 01:07:05,900
Why are you in a bad mood? Why?

1062
01:07:05,900 --> 01:07:08,360
Is it embarrassing for you because I'm someone who does nothing?

1063
01:07:08,360 --> 01:07:09,670
Yes.

1064
01:07:09,670 --> 01:07:12,480
Doing nothing and don’t want to do anything.

1065
01:07:12,480 --> 01:07:15,230
I feel embarrassed.

1066
01:07:15,230 --> 01:07:16,640
You...

1067
01:07:18,650 --> 01:07:21,720
I always feel that this is all from my greed

1068
01:07:23,510 --> 01:07:26,910
to make the professor alive in this way.

1069
01:07:28,950 --> 01:07:31,700
So I feel embarrassed.

1070
01:07:34,570 --> 01:07:36,290
But,

1071
01:07:36,290 --> 01:07:39,960
I don't just have bad thoughts.

1072
01:07:39,960 --> 01:07:42,900
If I negate Deity,

1073
01:07:42,900 --> 01:07:46,350
I'm worried that you will get hurt and
even run away.

1074
01:07:46,350 --> 01:07:50,520
So I accepted you as Deity at first.

1075
01:07:51,430 --> 01:07:53,950
But,

1076
01:07:53,950 --> 01:07:58,420
I gradually get closer to Deity,

1077
01:07:59,470 --> 01:08:03,530
so I seem to have forgotten the meaning of the professor's return.

1078
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,430
I thought he's deep in there

1079
01:08:09,310 --> 01:08:12,550
for a long-time break.

1080
01:08:15,670 --> 01:08:18,460
He has been trapped there for too long.

1081
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,399
Nobody can help him

1082
01:08:21,399 --> 01:08:23,920
get back.

1083
01:08:23,920 --> 01:08:26,710
Do Jin-woo won’t come back. Forget it.

1084
01:08:28,979 --> 01:08:31,710
You need to cheer up.

1085
01:08:31,710 --> 01:08:34,510
Think about

1086
01:08:34,510 --> 01:08:37,220
what kind of person you were.

1087
01:08:38,540 --> 01:08:40,750
Speaking of Professor Do,

1088
01:08:40,750 --> 01:08:43,229
he was capable and gentlemanly,

1089
01:08:43,229 --> 01:08:45,910
definitely a handsome guy.

1090
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,779
What about the Deity?

1091
01:08:47,779 --> 01:08:50,750
I am incompetent, not handsome,
not promising?

1092
01:08:50,750 --> 01:08:53,960
I'm not such a stingy god.

1093
01:08:53,960 --> 01:08:56,540
Why do you want Do Jin-woo
who is no longer alive back so much?

1094
01:08:56,540 --> 01:08:58,830
Isn’t it not enough just me?

1095
01:08:58,830 --> 01:09:03,160
Speaking of Deity, you're not real.

1096
01:09:03,930 --> 01:09:05,189
What do you mean by real?

1097
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:12,060
What do you think is real?

1098
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:17,189
Truth is often simple.

1099
01:09:17,189 --> 01:09:19,760
The real one is what you're seeing.

1100
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:22,380
The fake one is what you want to see.

1101
01:09:22,380 --> 01:09:23,779
So,

1102
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:31,640
I, the one you are seeing now, am the real one,

1103
01:09:31,640 --> 01:09:33,340
not Do Jin-woo.

1104
01:09:42,750 --> 01:09:47,580
Let's talk about it after
the professor's memory is recovered.

1105
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,350
Who is real?

1106
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:51,470
I told you that Do Jin-woo would never come back!

1107
01:09:51,470 --> 01:09:52,630
Why?

1108
01:09:52,630 --> 01:09:55,450
The Deity lives well now,
how can he come back?

1109
01:09:55,450 --> 01:09:59,110
Then as long as the Deity disappears.

1110
01:09:59,110 --> 01:10:00,220
What?

1111
01:10:01,600 --> 01:10:04,390
I said I wanted the Deity to disappear.

1112
01:10:04,390 --> 01:10:08,670
Please! Disappear!

1113
01:10:20,820 --> 01:10:22,390
Professor.

1114
01:10:23,660 --> 01:10:26,190
Professor Do. Professor.

1115
01:10:27,000 --> 01:10:28,350
Professor.

1116
01:10:29,290 --> 01:10:30,790
Professor.

1117
01:10:30,790 --> 01:10:33,520
Professor, wake up please!

1118
01:10:34,180 --> 01:10:37,750
Professor, wake up!

1119
01:10:37,750 --> 01:10:40,010
Professor!

1120
01:10:40,510 --> 01:10:44,220
Wake up professor!

1121
01:10:45,290 --> 01:10:47,630
Please!

1122
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:54,900
Oh my...I went back to the underworld.

1123
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,560
(Next episode preview)

1124
01:11:40,780 --> 01:11:41,560
You can never say

1125
01:11:41,560 --> 01:11:42,360
(Thanks to special appearance of An
Yeong-mi and Kim Byeong-chun.)
You can never say

1126
01:11:42,360 --> 01:11:43,310
you want the deity to disappear.
(Thanks to special appearance of An
Yeong-mi and Kim Byeong-chun.)

1127
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:44,610
Ease your mind.

1128
01:11:44,610 --> 01:11:46,930
I won’t say it again.

1129
01:11:46,930 --> 01:11:48,620
Why helping me do this?

1130
01:11:48,620 --> 01:11:50,490
We can't even do this?

1131
01:11:50,490 --> 01:11:52,500
What kind of relationship do you say we are in?

1132
01:11:52,500 --> 01:11:53,470
Lovers.

1133
01:11:53,470 --> 01:11:55,380
When will you get married?

1134
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:56,780
Get married?

1135
01:11:56,780 --> 01:12:00,120
Why will my brother marry you?

1136
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,080
Stop, Jeong-won.

1137
01:12:01,080 --> 01:12:02,710
You were the one who broke up with me first.

1138
01:12:02,710 --> 01:12:03,810
Why are you doing this now?

1139
01:12:03,810 --> 01:12:06,190
Professor, do you remember everything?

1140
01:12:06,190 --> 01:12:09,470
Nice to see you again.
