1
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:15,060
Sister.

2
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,320
Sister.

3
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:32,490
Sis.

4
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:34,630
Sister.

5
00:00:58,150 --> 00:00:59,570
(Episode 13)

6
00:01:21,410 --> 00:01:22,690
What's going on here?

7
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:28,220
Deity…

8
00:01:29,330 --> 00:01:30,310
Deity, your face…

9
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:52,350
You…

10
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:56,729
Who are you?

11
00:02:00,370 --> 00:02:02,330
-Deity. -I am not asking your name.

12
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,430
Are you a ghost?

13
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:07,740
Are you a spirit?

14
00:02:08,990 --> 00:02:09,919
Are you an angel?

15
00:02:09,919 --> 00:02:10,780
Are you a demon?

16
00:02:10,780 --> 00:02:12,640
Who is the Deity?

17
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,750
He is the god of the dead,

18
00:02:16,750 --> 00:02:18,590
and the death that everyone wants to escape,

19
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:19,829
that everyone is afraid of,

20
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,770
and that everyone does not love.

21
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:24,890
This is me.

22
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,110
Whatever you are…

23
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:34,310
Anyway, you are not human.

24
00:02:40,170 --> 00:02:42,320
Just think of it as gods need to pay attention to fame.

25
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,200
How dare you point the branch at the god of the underworld?

26
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:46,260
Do Jin-woo is not coming back.

27
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:48,310
The Deity is alive with his eyes wide open.

28
00:02:48,310 --> 00:02:49,210
How can he be here?

29
00:02:51,579 --> 00:02:52,410
That's right.

30
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:56,170
You said so from the beginning.

31
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,510
You told me you’re not human.

32
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:02,920
You said you weren't Do Jin-woo.

33
00:03:04,010 --> 00:03:06,250
I was confused by your appearance, so I didn't recognize you.

34
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:13,540
Then where's Do Jin-woo?

35
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:18,130
Did you kill him?

36
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:20,910
You pretended to be him after you killed him?

37
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,770
I didn't kill him, but he was already dead.

38
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:28,310
I just borrowed his body after his soul was gone.

39
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:31,950
Aren't you the god of the dead, the king of the underworld?

40
00:03:32,750 --> 00:03:35,050
But why are you wearing a mask of human in front of me?

41
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,000
It doesn't make sense.

42
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:37,550
Because it's a human’s wish.

43
00:03:39,590 --> 00:03:41,810
Just like a human would wish that someone won't die, that someone won’t get hurt,

44
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:43,990
that someone won't disappear,

45
00:03:44,540 --> 00:03:49,600
human will wish that someone will die, get hurt or disappear.

46
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,220
Who would wish for that?

47
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,710
Haven’t you ever wished
that the God who made this world like this to solve everything,

48
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,620
when you are facing the inevitable evil,

49
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:04,610
and feel unreasonable and painful because there is nothing you can do?

50
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,090
Have you never had a moment when the only way to live is to have someone die?

51
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:14,430
You…

52
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:22,089
You killed both the child abuser

53
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,470
and the rapist?

54
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,870
That's not true.

55
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,870
No, it's can’t be.

56
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:34,690
You couldn't have done that.

57
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:40,970
You... The Deity I knew was such a nice guy.

58
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:44,200
No.

59
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,659
Tell me you didn't kill them.

60
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,230
Han Gye-jeol, look at me.

61
00:04:56,350 --> 00:04:57,530
I'm just Deity.

62
00:04:59,140 --> 00:05:01,630
The person you've known since the beginning has never changed.

63
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:07,220
I have a bad temper, I'm fickle, and I say awful things.

64
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:10,570
I'm not a very nice person,

65
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,180
but I'm not a monster either.

66
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,360
Don't cry, please.

67
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:23,430
Don't touch me.

68
00:05:39,090 --> 00:05:41,480
Like you said, you may be a god.

69
00:05:44,070 --> 00:05:46,480
You wouldn't have cried because life was hard.

70
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,290
You wouldn't run away because you can't take it anymore.

71
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:55,040
You haven't seen your family die.

72
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,720
So you have never be crazy and feel the pain because of it.

73
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:01,720
Because you won't die, death should be easy for you.

74
00:06:02,910 --> 00:06:04,570
You underestimate death.

75
00:06:04,730 --> 00:06:07,750
That's why you speak of other people's deaths so easily.

76
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:13,590
That kind of mind, which is different from human mind, is like a monster to me.

77
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:24,050
That's why I've become afraid of you.

78
00:07:01,970 --> 00:07:03,990
You once asked me what I thought of you.

79
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,760
I'm sorry I'm late in answering.

80
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:15,440
I... I... love...

81
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:30,310
The me, full of despair, evil and eternal darkness,

82
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:37,180
dare not hope for a ray of light.

83
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,020
Turn off the lights.

84
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,170
You have to eat something.

85
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,690
I told you to turn off the light, didn't you hear me?

86
00:07:52,710 --> 00:07:53,810
Do you think I'm ridiculous too?

87
00:07:54,460 --> 00:07:55,820
I can't control my heart.

88
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,570
Is it ridiculous for me to fall like this?

89
00:08:00,290 --> 00:08:01,340
I knew this would happen.

90
00:08:02,990 --> 00:08:04,370
Why didn't you do something about it?

91
00:08:06,350 --> 00:08:07,340
What do you want me to do?

92
00:08:10,450 --> 00:08:13,330
Do you want me to strangle her like a monster?

93
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,990
Tell her that you were in pain and scared too.

94
00:08:21,990 --> 00:08:28,370
Tell her that you've been in pain for a thousand years and want to die.

95
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:29,830
Complain about who you're doing this for.

96
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:31,790
Who's the one to blame?

97
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:35,039
She doesn't know Seol-hui.

98
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,520
She couldn't remember even after she died.

99
00:08:41,450 --> 00:08:44,960
What's the point of justifying or complaining to someone who lost the memory?

100
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:49,270
I've thought about it many times.

101
00:08:51,090 --> 00:08:53,350
What would Han Gye-jeol do if she knew everything?

102
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:56,210
How much she would despise me?

103
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,450
But today, she looked so sad.

104
00:09:06,670 --> 00:09:07,960
She was crying all the time.

105
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,160
I couldn't even shed a tear when I saw her so sad.

106
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:20,600
It did hurt here, but I can't shed a tear.

107
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:29,080
I don't know if it's because I've been killing people,

108
00:09:30,060 --> 00:09:36,750
or if I've really become a monster.

109
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:43,790
It's right to be afraid.

110
00:09:45,810 --> 00:09:47,160
It's right to feel scared.

111
00:09:51,810 --> 00:09:53,460
Because I feel that I’m scary too.

112
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:14,570
I will be with you.

113
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,700
We’ll see our child's 20s, 30s.

114
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,380
Really?

115
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,810
But there are conditions.

116
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:32,420
Even if I become a horrible monster,

117
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:36,260
don't abandon me.

118
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:40,340
How can you do that?

119
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:53,510
How dare you? How dare you promise me a future?

120
00:10:56,490 --> 00:10:58,040
How dare you?

121
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:49,380
Sis, I'm hungry. I've been hungry all day. Let's eat.

122
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,220
Let's eat.

123
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,210
Come on, come on, come on.

124
00:12:03,110 --> 00:12:07,650
I'm sorry, I must have been crazy to leave you with a sick body.

125
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:09,990
You know I'm patient.

126
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,510
So it's not that hard to hold on to my hunger.

127
00:12:12,890 --> 00:12:16,510
That damn kidnapper didn't give me any food all day.

128
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:22,700
Even if they kidnapped me, they should let me eat.

129
00:12:24,270 --> 00:12:28,430
What kind of kidnapper gives food?

130
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:30,610
Is that kidnapping? That is feeding.

131
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,580
Are these nutritious enough?
What shall I make for you tonight?

132
00:12:45,020 --> 00:12:46,850
Shall I buy some oysters and ginseng and fry them for you?

133
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:50,750
Look, it's only after disappearing once that you think I'm precious.

134
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:53,330
So be good to me when I’m here.

135
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,170
Don't mend the fold after the sheep have been stolen.

136
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:57,940
Mend what?

137
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,470
The fold.

138
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:01,180
But why do you need to repair your brain after losing a sheep?

139
00:13:01,180 --> 00:13:02,970
(Note: "Fold” and "Brain" are homophones.)
But why do you need to repair your brain after losing a sheep?

140
00:13:03,590 --> 00:13:05,520
Is it to make it correct the mental state?

141
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:15,090
I just want to know how to fix the brain.

142
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,280
If you know, tell me how to do it, so I can make a lot of money.

143
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,070
It’s not that? Just forget it.

144
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,780
That's why you were framed twice for being so stupid.

145
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,420
Stop being a cop.

146
00:13:28,780 --> 00:13:31,250
If you can't protect yourself, who else can you protect?

147
00:13:31,250 --> 00:13:34,430
Hey, do you know how despicable that guy was when he jumped on me?

148
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,370
I'm the only one who could fix it with a few band-aids.

149
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:51,000
How dare he do something to my brother?

150
00:13:51,520 --> 00:13:52,650
He jumped from behind?

151
00:13:55,710 --> 00:13:58,790
If I catch him, I'll kill him!

152
00:13:59,330 --> 00:14:00,800
Now, that’s Han Gye-jeol.

153
00:14:01,790 --> 00:14:02,420
What?

154
00:14:02,420 --> 00:14:05,720
The sister I know is the crazy girl who will fight against the whole world.

155
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:11,200
Is that the right thing to say to the sister who cooks for you?

156
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,270
-He has to die once at my hands. -Hey.

157
00:14:18,190 --> 00:14:19,630
No matter who it is, don't kill anyone.

158
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:21,120
What?

159
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,530
Then I'll have to arrest you.

160
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:26,050
I don't want my family to face me as a murderer.

161
00:14:31,490 --> 00:14:34,520
Hey, you're so heartless.

162
00:14:35,350 --> 00:14:37,400
We're a family, shouldn't you turn a blind eye?

163
00:14:39,390 --> 00:14:43,250
I remembered that it's not a crime for the criminal’s family to conceal him.

164
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:44,650
But I'm a cop.

165
00:14:45,170 --> 00:14:46,200
This doesn't apply to cops.

166
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:47,340
So...

167
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:49,220
Don't do anything bad.

168
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:53,160
Even if you do, do not be found out.

169
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:57,210
What?

170
00:14:58,020 --> 00:15:00,560
Do you have something to say to me?

171
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:11,730
No, I don't.

172
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:34,780
What should I do?

173
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:37,340
What should I do

174
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:41,310
to calm down this warlike mood?

175
00:16:52,830 --> 00:16:56,550
I've been here before.

176
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:06,260
When my mother died, I felt it was unfair.

177
00:17:09,349 --> 00:17:10,700
Why did they take mom away,

178
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:13,170
even when my dad was gone?

179
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,020
Why did I have to listen to people call me an orphan?

180
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:21,730
Why did I have to be the one?

181
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:24,720
What did I do wrong?

182
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,430
That little heart really wants to ask God.

183
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:35,740
So did you get an answer?

184
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:44,140
No.

185
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:50,850
The priest said he didn't know the answer either.

186
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,250
And no one knows

187
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:57,840
why do some people lose their dependable dads;

188
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,640
why do they lose the daughter who holds them up;

189
00:18:02,020 --> 00:18:05,990
why do they lie in a hospital bed and envy their healthy friends.

190
00:18:09,310 --> 00:18:11,150
And then he told me:

191
00:18:12,190 --> 00:18:17,350
So it's not just you who are unfortunate.

192
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:21,750
Although I felt ashamed,

193
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:27,420
the words gave me a great sense of comfort.

194
00:18:30,090 --> 00:18:33,030
Although I don't know why it was me,

195
00:18:34,780 --> 00:18:36,870
hearing that others were as unfortunate as I was,

196
00:18:37,670 --> 00:18:39,320
the feeling of grievance gradually disappeared.

197
00:18:41,610 --> 00:18:42,590
It's the same now.

198
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:46,240
Why did it have to be me?

199
00:18:47,190 --> 00:18:49,200
What did I do wrong?

200
00:18:50,210 --> 00:18:51,830
I just love someone.

201
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,170
Why is it so unfortunate?

202
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:56,140
Although I still don't know the reason,

203
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:03,310
I know what I have to do to get comfort.

204
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:18,130
So I wish someone else could be
as miserable and unhappy as I am.

205
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:24,090
I hope that person only thinks about those good days,

206
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:30,720
cries and laughs at times, and then goes crazy.

207
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:53,390
Why would you put this...

208
00:19:55,940 --> 00:19:58,190
I heard that priests are very close to gods.

209
00:19:59,590 --> 00:20:01,610
Please tell the god I know that

210
00:20:04,690 --> 00:20:09,830
may he be very unhappy without me.

211
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:36,920
I knew it was you.

212
00:20:50,910 --> 00:20:52,650
Now that we meet, let me ask you.

213
00:20:54,350 --> 00:20:55,460
Why did you lie to me?

214
00:20:57,450 --> 00:20:59,300
You're not human, why didn't you tell me?

215
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:02,340
When you knew I was suspecting you,

216
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,930
why didn't you tell me?

217
00:21:05,810 --> 00:21:07,370
Do you know how tormented I was

218
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:09,030
during the time you lied to me?

219
00:21:10,090 --> 00:21:12,350
Whether it was betrayal or not, I pretended not to know.

220
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,860
Whether it was multiple personalities or not

221
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:16,990
I was so stubborn that I just want you to remember me.

222
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:20,110
They even call you a murderer now.

223
00:21:22,470 --> 00:21:23,410
But then I remembered

224
00:21:23,410 --> 00:21:24,270
the words you once said to me.

225
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:25,780
“Don't abandon you even if you become a monster.”

226
00:21:27,800 --> 00:21:30,310
Just thinking about how you would feel when you said that,

227
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:32,860
I was already going crazy.

228
00:21:35,820 --> 00:21:38,590
Why did you watch me go crazy with you?

229
00:21:39,510 --> 00:21:42,090
You know that the end of that road is hell.

230
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,810
Why?

231
00:21:51,770 --> 00:21:52,600
Because I am afraid.

232
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,470
Your job is to heal and save people.

233
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:00,360
And you will never forgive murder.

234
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,850
So I'm afraid that you'll despise me.

235
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:10,870
I'm afraid that I'll end up being alone again.

236
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,790
Even so, you should let me make the choice!

237
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:19,240
Whether I will love you or hate you,

238
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:21,600
forgive you or denounce you,

239
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,750
kill you or save you.

240
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:25,490
You should have let me choose before I became obsessed with you.

241
00:22:26,460 --> 00:22:28,810
Before I say that I don't care if you're a murderer or a monster,

242
00:22:28,810 --> 00:22:30,080
let me escape.

243
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,740
I'm sorry for making you suffer so much.

244
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:36,330
But Han Gye-jeol, I have no regret.

245
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,200
That's why I can't apologize to you either.

246
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,810
Even if I went back in time and had the chance to be honest with you,

247
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,810
I would still cheat you, keep you hooked and keep you crazy.

248
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,650
I would never let you run away or even let you have this intention.

249
00:22:54,160 --> 00:22:55,540
Is it because you're not human?

250
00:22:58,220 --> 00:22:59,710
You're really cheeky.

251
00:23:04,490 --> 00:23:07,270
It's better to be cheeky than unfortunate.

252
00:23:13,390 --> 00:23:14,660
Han Gye-jeol,

253
00:23:15,670 --> 00:23:22,410
I'm already unlucky without you.

254
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:23,880
And I'm still unlucky.

255
00:23:28,210 --> 00:23:31,090
Let’s stop being unlucky.

256
00:23:31,090 --> 00:23:31,900
Let’s start over...

257
00:23:31,900 --> 00:23:34,520
No.

258
00:23:34,520 --> 00:23:39,090
I already know how this story ends.

259
00:23:39,090 --> 00:23:40,890
It ends too sadly.

260
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:46,540
Though loved by a god,

261
00:23:46,540 --> 00:23:49,990
I’ll be alone, growing old and wrinkled.

262
00:23:49,990 --> 00:23:51,010
Then the god's love becomes different,

263
00:23:51,010 --> 00:23:53,020
I will be like an unfortunate cicada.

264
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,410
My love won't change.

265
00:23:55,410 --> 00:23:56,940
Just like I love the young Han Gye-jeol,

266
00:23:56,940 --> 00:23:58,890
I'll also love the older Han Gye-jeol.

267
00:23:58,890 --> 00:24:01,980
Even if you don't change, I will.

268
00:24:01,980 --> 00:24:04,580
I'll be jealous of you who's forever young.

269
00:24:04,580 --> 00:24:07,160
Eventually, I'll go crazy because of my anxiety.

270
00:24:08,670 --> 00:24:15,760
I want us to grow old and wrinkly together, and then enjoy our elderly.

271
00:24:16,940 --> 00:24:22,220
It doesn't matter if you're not a doctor or a plutocrat.

272
00:24:22,220 --> 00:24:24,530
Just be a human.

273
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:33,670
Why can't you satisfy me with this one?

274
00:24:43,890 --> 00:24:46,100
I don't know what you mean by human

275
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:48,670
is to have a human heart

276
00:24:48,670 --> 00:24:49,680
or to be born as a human.

277
00:24:49,680 --> 00:24:51,990
Or to die as a human.

278
00:24:54,330 --> 00:25:00,190
But I'll try anything you want.

279
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:02,830
Can you do it?

280
00:25:02,830 --> 00:25:05,850
I don't know how, but I'll try.

281
00:25:05,850 --> 00:25:09,540
Give me a chance to try. Give me some time.

282
00:25:13,530 --> 00:25:16,650
Just show me mercy

283
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,890
until that time.

284
00:25:46,730 --> 00:25:48,010
In exchange,

285
00:25:51,190 --> 00:25:55,640
when you find a way, we'll be in touch.

286
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:02,570
I also need a reason to face my pride.

287
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,030
Don't you have any pride?

288
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:22,680
I thought we hadn't talked for days.

289
00:26:22,680 --> 00:26:25,560
But you're still struggling to break up?

290
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:29,750
Who's upset? Break up today.

291
00:26:29,750 --> 00:26:32,140
Report to me immediately after the breakup.

292
00:26:32,140 --> 00:26:36,970
But do we have to break up now?

293
00:26:39,160 --> 00:26:40,890
It’s so cold.

294
00:26:40,890 --> 00:26:44,990
It's okay to break up in spring after winter.

295
00:26:44,990 --> 00:26:46,960
Is the boyfriend a resource I need to prepare for the winter?

296
00:26:46,960 --> 00:26:48,220
Is boyfriend the Kimchi?

297
00:26:48,220 --> 00:26:49,780
After the winter, bullshit!

298
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:52,330
You're going to get in big trouble
if you go on like this.

299
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:54,160
What kind of trouble?

300
00:26:54,160 --> 00:26:57,490
If Officer Han finds out
what you did to his sister.

301
00:26:57,490 --> 00:27:00,680
If I were him, I'd kill you and throw you into hell.

302
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:04,110
Break up. We'll break up. Just break up.

303
00:27:04,110 --> 00:27:07,150
Yes, break up!

304
00:27:07,150 --> 00:27:09,440
Break up with who?

305
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:11,270
I'll call you back later.

306
00:27:15,670 --> 00:27:19,560
What's wrong with your face?
Did you get hurt? How?

307
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,430
It's just a part of our job. It doesn’t matter.

308
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,770
No. You are badly hurt.

309
00:27:23,770 --> 00:27:25,700
My family member is a doctor.
She said it's fine.

310
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:27,190
She knows nothing.

311
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,520
What?

312
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:36,090
Usually doctors can not treat
their own family very well.

313
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:37,090
Ah...

314
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:41,330
What about the food?

315
00:27:41,330 --> 00:27:42,990
Did you eat properly?

316
00:27:42,990 --> 00:27:44,410
My sister made me chicken stew.

317
00:27:44,410 --> 00:27:46,120
Chicken stew?

318
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:49,330
It might give you diarrhea.
How could she let you eat chicken fat?

319
00:27:49,330 --> 00:27:51,880
Anyway, people in the emergency room
only know how to mend wounds,

320
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,700
they don't know how terrible internal injuries are.

321
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:58,740
How do you know my sister is
an emergency room doctor?

322
00:27:58,740 --> 00:28:00,760
Well...

323
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:04,270
You told me that last time.

324
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:05,110
Me?

325
00:28:05,110 --> 00:28:08,730
Of course, your memory is really bad.

326
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:10,570
Is that why you broke up with me?

327
00:28:10,570 --> 00:28:13,780
Because my memory is so bad
and I am not smart?

328
00:28:13,780 --> 00:28:14,830
Yes.

329
00:28:14,830 --> 00:28:18,140
What can I do to satisfy you?

330
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:20,010
Should I take the medical school?

331
00:28:20,010 --> 00:28:21,530
Are you kidding me now?

332
00:28:21,530 --> 00:28:23,540
It’s so hard to get into medical school.

333
00:28:23,540 --> 00:28:25,770
Yes, with my intelligence, I don't know
how many years it will take.

334
00:28:25,770 --> 00:28:26,860
But I will still try.

335
00:28:26,860 --> 00:28:30,360
Until then, don't break up with me.

336
00:28:30,360 --> 00:28:31,570
Are you threatening me now?

337
00:28:31,570 --> 00:28:33,380
No, I’m negotiating.

338
00:28:38,190 --> 00:28:39,860
You're laughing.

339
00:28:40,990 --> 00:28:41,970
So...

340
00:28:47,830 --> 00:28:49,680
Are you old and confused?

341
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:51,580
Why are you spying on people in my store?

342
00:28:51,580 --> 00:28:53,340
Because it's not someone else.

343
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,310
If it's not someone else, is it your lover?

344
00:28:55,310 --> 00:28:58,760
Aigoo, you old man, what are your eyes for?

345
00:28:58,760 --> 00:29:01,150
It's a pity about your eyelids. Watch this.

346
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:07,740
That man is Dr. Han's brother.

347
00:29:07,740 --> 00:29:09,930
The woman is the uncultured person

348
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:12,940
who fought with Dr. Han because of Johns.

349
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,700
You still can't figure it out?

350
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:19,670
That’s bad. Sister and brother can’t do that.

351
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:25,200
Yes, it's all messed up.

352
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:45,450
He can’t become human after eating wormwood and garlic.

353
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:50,390
I know it's impossible to contact easily.

354
00:29:50,390 --> 00:29:51,880
Why am I always waiting?

355
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,060
(Boss Wu)

356
00:30:38,490 --> 00:30:42,330
Pulling out the people who are resting at home,
aren’t you annoying?

357
00:30:42,330 --> 00:30:45,530
I just miss Dr. Han, so I asked her to come.

358
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:48,050
I didn't ask her to come to tell her something.

359
00:30:48,190 --> 00:30:49,300
You...

360
00:30:49,300 --> 00:30:51,420
I'm fine.

361
00:30:51,420 --> 00:30:55,350
I didn't want to be alone and wanted to come here.

362
00:30:55,350 --> 00:30:56,780
Why don't you like being alone?

363
00:30:58,450 --> 00:31:02,760
I always think about things when I'm alone.

364
00:31:02,760 --> 00:31:07,600
What do you think? You know what?

365
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:11,710
Yes. It’s said that you can’t be alone with so many thoughts.

366
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:14,710
Because there's always bored ghosts to talk with you.

367
00:31:14,710 --> 00:31:15,270
Ghosts?

368
00:31:15,270 --> 00:31:20,790
So you should always be careful of the ghosts.

369
00:31:20,790 --> 00:31:23,750
Are you calling me a ghost now?

370
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:26,840
Ghost, go away.

371
00:31:52,180 --> 00:31:56,440
Oops, I forgot the milk is out of stock.
Come with me.

372
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,590
You can read the room this time.

373
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,590
Have you found the way?

374
00:32:09,070 --> 00:32:13,200
Let's kiss first.

375
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,450
Do you want to become human with a real kiss?

376
00:32:16,450 --> 00:32:19,030
Like the Frog Prince, Beauty and the Beast?

377
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:21,540
You’d better say that you can become human by eating wormwood or garlic.

378
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:23,490
At least there will be relics after eating them for 100 days, right?

379
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:24,620
This makes more sense, right?

380
00:32:24,620 --> 00:32:26,210
It has nothing to do with that.

381
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,310
Then why kiss?

382
00:32:28,310 --> 00:32:29,340
Do you think I'm that frivolous?

383
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:30,940
Why mention kissing?

384
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:33,790
Who said to kiss first?

385
00:32:33,790 --> 00:32:36,940
We need to arrange to give the same story
before being investigated.
(Note: "Kissing" and "Collusion" are homophones.)

386
00:32:36,940 --> 00:32:38,400
Investigation?

387
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,310
Didn't they contact you?
They said they were investigating the explosion.

388
00:32:40,310 --> 00:32:41,900
We're going to be investigated as witnesses.

389
00:32:41,900 --> 00:32:44,350
If you go to the police station without
a countermeasure, you will definitely tell everything.

390
00:32:44,350 --> 00:32:48,630
That's why I told you to arrange to give the same story.

391
00:32:48,630 --> 00:32:50,810
Oh, you mean that.

392
00:32:50,810 --> 00:32:54,890
There is nothing we need to arrange.

393
00:32:54,890 --> 00:32:56,800
There was nothing around.

394
00:32:56,800 --> 00:33:00,130
While we were looking for my brother,
there was an explosion in the distance.

395
00:33:00,130 --> 00:33:02,510
We were in a hurry to escape and didn't see anything.

396
00:33:02,510 --> 00:33:04,690
Just say that.

397
00:33:04,690 --> 00:33:07,060
At this time, you’re smart.

398
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,310
Of course, human beings have such brains too.

399
00:33:10,310 --> 00:33:11,720
If I think I’m no smart enough,

400
00:33:11,720 --> 00:33:13,780
then let the useless guys help each other.

401
00:33:13,780 --> 00:33:15,800
Although I'm not as capable as God,

402
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,320
I don't need God's help to live.

403
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,530
Do you hate me being in the world so much?

404
00:33:25,050 --> 00:33:27,420
I'm not here because I like being here.

405
00:33:28,540 --> 00:33:30,420
Then why are you here?

406
00:33:30,420 --> 00:33:32,370
It's my punishment.

407
00:33:32,370 --> 00:33:34,270
Why are you being punished?

408
00:33:39,770 --> 00:33:42,370
Did you betray your country?

409
00:33:42,370 --> 00:33:45,740
Or are you Rebellion God?
Did you plan a rebellion?

410
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:47,720
Like a fallen angel?

411
00:33:50,480 --> 00:33:52,230
Because I fell in love with someone.

412
00:33:55,430 --> 00:33:58,320
I was told not to fall in love with her, but I did.

413
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,740
I was told not to wait, but I did.

414
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:03,740
But that person passed by like the wind.

415
00:34:03,740 --> 00:34:07,640
For the sin of staying in the same place,

416
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:09,989
and for the sin of stupidity,

417
00:34:09,989 --> 00:34:11,400
I was still punished.

418
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,290
I will protect you, Seol Hui.

419
00:34:20,290 --> 00:34:21,620
What's wrong, Han Gye-jeol?

420
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,679
Do you feel sick? Should we go to the hospital first?

421
00:34:26,090 --> 00:34:27,070
I'm fine.

422
00:34:31,260 --> 00:34:36,000
Was the woman you loved

423
00:34:37,500 --> 00:34:40,030
called Seol Hui?

424
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:42,030
How do you know?

425
00:34:42,030 --> 00:34:44,449
Do you remember something?

426
00:34:44,449 --> 00:34:46,820
Yes.

427
00:34:46,820 --> 00:34:49,500
It all comes back to me.

428
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:53,540
How could I forget about that?

429
00:34:53,540 --> 00:34:56,290
A man even took out a ring.

430
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:02,860
Are you Seol Hui?

431
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,810
Are you Seol Hui?

432
00:35:04,810 --> 00:35:07,230
He’s shouting.

433
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,170
No human being can forget that.

434
00:35:08,170 --> 00:35:10,580
How can I forget that?

435
00:35:10,580 --> 00:35:12,970
What else did you say?

436
00:35:12,970 --> 00:35:16,250
She blossomed in my heart and never faded.

437
00:35:16,250 --> 00:35:18,150
Seol Hui is the cause of my misery and pain,

438
00:35:18,150 --> 00:35:22,130
and also the only salvation.

439
00:35:22,130 --> 00:35:24,940
Every word is a famous phrase that I can't forget.

440
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:26,420
Although I am a military general,

441
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:29,040
my whole family is famous for writings.

442
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:31,840
I'm so angry with every word!

443
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,300
You thought I was Seol Hui, so you followed me.

444
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,850
When you found out I wasn't Seol Hui,
you gave me a hard time.

445
00:35:38,850 --> 00:35:39,890
It makes me mad to think about it.

446
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:40,880
No.

447
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,370
You said you didn't have a nurse,
so I arranged Gak Shin for you.

448
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:43,910
You said the victim was replaced,
so I found Bak Chung-seong for you.

449
00:35:43,910 --> 00:35:45,570
Is this all harassment?

450
00:35:45,570 --> 00:35:47,290
You did it all for Seol Hui.

451
00:35:47,290 --> 00:35:49,730
Because I'm a little bit like Seol Hui.

452
00:35:49,730 --> 00:35:52,660
Aigoo, it's so late.

453
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,640
She must be pretty.

454
00:35:54,640 --> 00:35:57,630
You still can't forget her after 1,000 years.

455
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:01,140
How much does she look like me?
What do we look like?

456
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:04,760
The eyes? Nose? Mouth?

457
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,910
Toes?

458
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:08,470
Oh, brother-in-law.

459
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,910
Where?

460
00:36:10,910 --> 00:36:11,910
Where is he?

461
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:21,820
What happened?

462
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,840
Why did you follow me here?

463
00:36:31,430 --> 00:36:33,810
Are you crazy? Why are you so careless?

464
00:36:33,810 --> 00:36:36,570
There are so many people watching.
What if we get caught?

465
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:37,270
We won't be found out.

466
00:36:37,270 --> 00:36:38,010
What do you mean by that?

467
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:50,330
So you were looking for Officer Han,

468
00:36:50,330 --> 00:36:53,070
and then there was an explosion on the other side, right?

469
00:36:53,780 --> 00:36:57,220
You were running away, so you didn't see anything?

470
00:36:58,410 --> 00:36:59,190
Yes.

471
00:37:00,050 --> 00:37:02,270
Really? But it's weird.

472
00:37:03,380 --> 00:37:04,900
Why? What’s so weird?

473
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:09,830
They said they found a receiver in the wreckage.

474
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:12,430
A receiver? What's that?

475
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:17,990
In short, it's not a bomb that's set to go off at a certain time,

476
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:22,870
but a remote-controlled bomb that
goes off at the flip of a switch.

477
00:37:24,310 --> 00:37:28,920
It must have gone off because
someone walked near the refrigerator.

478
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:33,380
But no one was hurt. That's not right.

479
00:37:40,860 --> 00:37:45,280
What's so strange? Maybe the guy accidentally
pressed the wrong button.

480
00:37:45,950 --> 00:37:48,580
Really? We'll see.

481
00:37:49,150 --> 00:37:49,780
What?

482
00:37:50,620 --> 00:37:51,780
Just in time.

483
00:37:51,780 --> 00:37:53,100
I brought the video over.

484
00:37:54,510 --> 00:37:55,260
Thank you for your hard work.

485
00:37:57,520 --> 00:37:59,300
What's that?

486
00:38:00,190 --> 00:38:02,410
This is the police law enforcement recorder
carried by the police at that time.

487
00:38:02,410 --> 00:38:04,980
He said he arrived at the scene
before the explosion.

488
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:07,020
Most of it should have been recorded.

489
00:38:08,620 --> 00:38:10,490
Officer Han, take a look at it with me.

490
00:38:10,490 --> 00:38:11,990
My eyes are not good recently.

491
00:38:16,750 --> 00:38:17,800
I'm in a hurry to go to the bathroom.

492
00:38:21,470 --> 00:38:23,960
He has a bad stomach at such an important time.

493
00:38:29,490 --> 00:38:31,670
Can you do something? Anything.

494
00:38:31,670 --> 00:38:33,030
What do you want me to do?

495
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:36,270
Erase the memory or stop time.
Just do something!

496
00:38:36,270 --> 00:38:38,570
I can't do that. I'm not that kind of god.

497
00:38:39,950 --> 00:38:42,990
Then try hypnosis. You've done well before, haven't you?

498
00:38:44,170 --> 00:38:46,190
Officer Kim, what's your name?

499
00:38:47,170 --> 00:38:49,350
My name is...

500
00:38:51,190 --> 00:38:52,640
I found it.

501
00:39:01,020 --> 00:39:02,280
Wait, what happened?

502
00:39:37,780 --> 00:39:38,760
What are you doing?

503
00:39:38,760 --> 00:39:40,700
What if someone sees it?

504
00:39:40,700 --> 00:39:43,580
It's you, the one who deleted the video.

505
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,120
Yes, I deleted it.

506
00:39:46,830 --> 00:39:49,660
I think there's a reason that
my sister is trying to protect you.

507
00:39:50,710 --> 00:39:53,540
If you get caught, I'm afraid something
will happen to that idiot too.

508
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:56,290
Even so, how can you be so shameless
as to disclose your identity?

509
00:39:56,290 --> 00:39:58,210
If it's not to my liking, I can get you in.

510
00:39:59,070 --> 00:40:00,550
Even if I get caught,

511
00:40:00,550 --> 00:40:03,510
I think it's basic etiquette to introduce myself
to the person who saved my life,

512
00:40:03,510 --> 00:40:06,000
that's why I’m here to see you.

513
00:40:07,300 --> 00:40:10,890
Okay, let's hear who you are first.

514
00:40:10,890 --> 00:40:13,060
Are you a magician or do you have superpowers?

515
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:17,520
You're rich, too. Do you want to play Batman?

516
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:19,410
And why did you kill so many people?

517
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:23,820
I am the god of the underworld and
the god of the dead, Deity.

518
00:40:26,590 --> 00:40:27,540
God?

519
00:40:28,170 --> 00:40:30,500
Humans don't need gods anymore.

520
00:40:30,500 --> 00:40:34,360
But because of the desire of the Creator
who still wants to be needed by mankind,

521
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:37,750
I'm doing things that would be called
a miracle or a heavenly punishment,

522
00:40:37,750 --> 00:40:39,630
and what would be called killing.

523
00:40:40,530 --> 00:40:43,140
I don't know what it's like in the underworld,
but in this world,

524
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:47,160
I’m just a sword of execution at the whim of the Creator, that's all.

525
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:50,670
You're not even human.

526
00:40:52,900 --> 00:40:53,880
That's ridiculous.

527
00:40:54,600 --> 00:40:56,770
It's so unbelievable, but why would I believe it?

528
00:40:58,320 --> 00:41:01,530
Are you the ghost in Don't know what ghosts are doing?

529
00:41:01,530 --> 00:41:03,980
I didn't say I was a ghost, did I?

530
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,190
You're not human anyway, are you?

531
00:41:06,780 --> 00:41:09,060
You only care about whether I'm human or not?

532
00:41:09,710 --> 00:41:12,900
Don't you care about what I'm thinking,
and what kind of pain I'm going through?

533
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:15,150
Humans, what is that? Why is it so important?

534
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:18,390
Because I'm a detective who arrests humans, not gods.

535
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:21,160
I know all about the laws of Korea,

536
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,540
but I know nothing about the laws of the underworld.

537
00:41:23,540 --> 00:41:25,640
So I don't know if it's right to arrest you.

538
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:30,090
Even if I do, I don't know how to apply the law.

539
00:41:34,940 --> 00:41:37,330
But that doesn't mean I'm on your side.

540
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,000
I can sue you at any time.

541
00:41:42,670 --> 00:41:46,340
Of course, I'm guilty myself.
So I'm ready to take off my police uniform.

542
00:41:47,050 --> 00:41:48,710
Besides, I can put up with other things.

543
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:51,150
Well...

544
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:55,500
The thing that I can't bear is that
my sister is dating an underworld agent.

545
00:41:56,430 --> 00:41:58,700
How can you compare me to the underworld agent?

546
00:41:59,220 --> 00:42:01,940
Anyway, I need time to think about it.

547
00:42:01,940 --> 00:42:03,460
Before that, I will keep a distance to observe you.

548
00:42:04,010 --> 00:42:05,820
That's all I can say now.

549
00:42:07,570 --> 00:42:08,370
Great.

550
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,580
I just need time too.

551
00:42:11,390 --> 00:42:13,900
Time to keep you and your sister safe.

552
00:42:14,500 --> 00:42:17,360
Time to send Kim Pil-soo and that killer to prison.

553
00:42:19,590 --> 00:42:23,470
I'll talk about the rest later, too.

554
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,920
No.

555
00:42:24,920 --> 00:42:28,180
I'll catch Kim Pil-soo and the killer myself.

556
00:42:28,180 --> 00:42:29,440
So you gods, stay out of it.

557
00:42:34,590 --> 00:42:36,720
Then how about we work together?

558
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:38,920
If my abilities and your experience are combined,

559
00:42:38,920 --> 00:42:40,790
we can catch them faster.

560
00:42:46,160 --> 00:42:46,820
I agree.

561
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:56,990
Don't tell my sister about
you being exposed to me.

562
00:42:56,990 --> 00:42:58,560
Otherwise I'm afraid she'll read face me.

563
00:43:00,080 --> 00:43:01,080
Okay.

564
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,550
Damn it!

565
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:08,140
The problem is the guy named Do Jin-woo.

566
00:43:08,140 --> 00:43:11,710
Since Jeong met him, he's become more aggressive and bullying.

567
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:13,620
He's not training,

568
00:43:13,620 --> 00:43:15,810
so I just said it was a breach of contract.

569
00:43:15,810 --> 00:43:17,770
Then he made me look like this.

570
00:43:17,770 --> 00:43:17,830
(Seo Jung-gwon (pseudonym)
I heard that there is a possibility that my arm will be crippled.
But there was not even a single phone call.)
Then he made me look like this.

571
00:43:17,830 --> 00:43:19,940
I might lose my arm in the future.
(Seo Jung-gwon (pseudonym)
I heard that there is a possibility that my arm will be crippled.
But there was not even a single phone call.)

572
00:43:19,940 --> 00:43:22,210
But he didn't even make a phone call.
(Seo Jung-gwon (pseudonym)
I heard that there is a possibility that my arm will be crippled.
But there was not even a single phone call.)

573
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:25,630
This is the residence where Jeong stayed
after leaving the training ground.

574
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:30,100
It looks like a high-class suite with a bodyguard.

575
00:43:30,100 --> 00:43:34,460
According to the interview,
all the expenses are paid by Bulhwa Company.

576
00:43:34,460 --> 00:43:37,690
Then why does Bulhwa Company want to cooperate with Jeong

577
00:43:37,690 --> 00:43:39,910
even though it would cause such a dispute?

578
00:43:39,910 --> 00:43:43,320
Could it be related to the fact that

579
00:43:43,320 --> 00:43:44,860
the spokesperson of Pilseong Bio's new drug is Jeong?

580
00:43:44,860 --> 00:43:49,030
Is this all Bulhwa Company’s plan
to acquire Pilseong Bio?

581
00:43:49,030 --> 00:43:51,720
Everyone is very concerned about this.

582
00:43:51,720 --> 00:43:53,190
It's time for him to come.

583
00:44:03,400 --> 00:44:04,400
Stop.

584
00:44:07,090 --> 00:44:08,970
I knew you'd do this.

585
00:44:08,970 --> 00:44:10,840
Brother.

586
00:44:10,840 --> 00:44:13,470
The guys who are going to kill me are saying such things,

587
00:44:13,470 --> 00:44:15,750
and you still want me to let them say it?

588
00:44:15,750 --> 00:44:18,430
What can you do when you see him?

589
00:44:18,430 --> 00:44:19,930
Tell me about your thoughts.

590
00:44:19,930 --> 00:44:21,020
Of course they should be held accountable
for their crimes.

591
00:44:21,020 --> 00:44:22,670
So what are you going to do?

592
00:44:23,860 --> 00:44:24,840
Like a man.

593
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:29,380
What a great plan.

594
00:44:29,380 --> 00:44:33,530
Isn't there any evidence or testimony in your plan?

595
00:44:33,530 --> 00:44:34,730
I'm the evidence.

596
00:44:34,730 --> 00:44:36,910
The evidence that he poisoned you
and drowned you.

597
00:44:36,910 --> 00:44:38,870
It's just your side of the story right now.

598
00:44:38,870 --> 00:44:40,400
You can't do anything with those.

599
00:44:42,560 --> 00:44:45,800
I try to help you.

600
00:44:45,800 --> 00:44:51,360
To help his brother who was fighting against the Yuan Dynasty,
he became a lonely soul at the execution site.

601
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:56,010
(Nam Se-ri (27) male)

602
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:05,880
Aigoo, I gave up my room to Jeong I-deun.

603
00:45:05,880 --> 00:45:09,020
What does Kim Pil-soo have against me...

604
00:45:09,020 --> 00:45:10,930
So troublesome, so troublesome!

605
00:45:12,420 --> 00:45:16,810
That's right. Why did the bullying
matter come to light?

606
00:45:16,810 --> 00:45:20,380
If they mess with Jeong I-deun,

607
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:23,290
they will be doomed.

608
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:25,250
Lord Deity.

609
00:45:25,250 --> 00:45:27,910
It’s the same as Cry Wolf.

610
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:30,060
Accusing the other party of
violence and bullying without evidence

611
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,490
is to use pre-emptive means

612
00:45:31,490 --> 00:45:35,070
to damage the image of entertainers
or politicians.

613
00:45:35,070 --> 00:45:37,090
If this continues, the public will not believe them

614
00:45:37,090 --> 00:45:38,820
no matter what they say.

615
00:45:38,820 --> 00:45:41,260
He wants to make Jeong I-deun a liar.

616
00:45:41,260 --> 00:45:42,300
That's right.

617
00:45:42,300 --> 00:45:44,140
To hide something.

618
00:45:45,860 --> 00:45:47,230
Perhaps.

619
00:45:49,690 --> 00:45:53,000
If it was just for that, wouldn't it be cleaner to

620
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:54,770
kill the broker

621
00:45:54,770 --> 00:45:56,000
and plant the blame on Jeong I-deun?

622
00:45:56,000 --> 00:45:59,000
Why didn’t he kill the broker directly?

623
00:46:01,130 --> 00:46:01,880
It makes sense.

624
00:46:04,820 --> 00:46:07,170
What would be the truth
about Jeong I-deun to hide

625
00:46:07,170 --> 00:46:11,300
even if it was so far-fetched?

626
00:46:11,300 --> 00:46:14,490
Perhaps he is intimidated by the thought of
participating in the clinic openly.

627
00:46:14,490 --> 00:46:17,820
It's not very clear, and it’s not signed,

628
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:20,110
so is it necessary for him to destroy himself?

629
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,530
(Nam Se-ri (27) male)

630
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:27,290
Could Jeong I-deun be Nam Se-ri?

631
00:46:27,290 --> 00:46:28,470
What?

632
00:46:28,470 --> 00:46:30,530
Signing contracts and sponsorships
shows commitment to him.

633
00:46:30,530 --> 00:46:31,570
I find this very odd.

634
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:32,730
Since he is a famous person,

635
00:46:32,730 --> 00:46:35,500
he recorded under a pseudonym
known only to Kim Pil-soo.

636
00:46:38,680 --> 00:46:39,780
Nam Se-ri.

637
00:46:39,780 --> 00:46:42,360
Nam, a man. Se-ri, a golfer.
(Note: In Korean, "Nam" and "male", "Se-ri" and "Se-ri" have the same pronunciation.
Se-ri refers to Korean female golfer Bak Se-ri.)

638
00:46:42,360 --> 00:46:43,650
It makes sense!

639
00:46:43,650 --> 00:46:45,060
I didn’t mean that!

640
00:46:45,060 --> 00:46:45,810
Wait, Lord Deity.

641
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:51,270
Then I have to take Jeong I-deun
to the hospital as soon as possible.

642
00:46:51,270 --> 00:46:53,530
Why? He is not feeling well?

643
00:46:53,530 --> 00:46:55,020
Lord Deity.

644
00:46:55,020 --> 00:46:56,670
Do you know why false accounts are made?

645
00:46:56,670 --> 00:46:57,980
Why are you saying this all of a sudden?

646
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,320
Just to make the unreasonable things reasonable.

647
00:47:01,320 --> 00:47:03,310
Treating the results of
the physical examination as normal

648
00:47:03,310 --> 00:47:07,190
means that he has a health problem.

649
00:47:07,190 --> 00:47:08,750
They want to hide something,

650
00:47:08,750 --> 00:47:11,370
such as clinical side effects.

651
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:15,550
So if Jeong I-deun were really Nam Se-ri,

652
00:47:15,550 --> 00:47:16,710
he might have some health problem?

653
00:47:16,710 --> 00:47:17,560
Yes.

654
00:47:29,020 --> 00:47:29,700
(There's something I need to talk with you. See you at the cafe.)

655
00:47:29,700 --> 00:47:31,830
I have something to discuss with you.
(There's something I need to talk with you. See you at the cafe.)

656
00:47:31,830 --> 00:47:33,330
See you at the cafe.

657
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:42,650
Anything he needs.

658
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:49,420
You are really obedient.

659
00:47:51,700 --> 00:47:54,090
Do you have the self-esteem to make excuses?

660
00:48:10,050 --> 00:48:11,620
Why do you need self-esteem?

661
00:48:11,620 --> 00:48:13,690
It's hard enough now.

662
00:48:13,690 --> 00:48:14,990
What are you doing?

663
00:48:16,660 --> 00:48:18,760
I'm preventing my woman
from freezing to death.

664
00:48:20,780 --> 00:48:23,680
I'm not asking this, okay?

665
00:48:23,680 --> 00:48:26,180
Why do you keep showing up
out of the blue? It's scary.

666
00:48:26,180 --> 00:48:28,000
Because you are always calling me.

667
00:48:28,000 --> 00:48:28,870
Me?

668
00:48:31,130 --> 00:48:34,340
Are you called when I think of you?

669
00:48:36,490 --> 00:48:38,850
Do you think I'm a fool?

670
00:48:38,850 --> 00:48:41,880
If I can see you when I think about you,
we'll see each other all day long.

671
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:44,890
Are you confessing that you've
been thinking about me all day?

672
00:48:48,680 --> 00:48:52,090
I'm confessing to you.
I think about you all day.

673
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:59,470
If I think about someone for a long time,
I will instantly be by her side,

674
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:02,010
just like now.

675
00:49:05,170 --> 00:49:09,960
So the important thing you want to say
is confession?

676
00:49:09,960 --> 00:49:10,830
Yes.

677
00:49:11,890 --> 00:49:13,110
Let's kiss.

678
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:14,830
Ouch, look at you...

679
00:49:14,830 --> 00:49:16,360
Why do you always tease me like this?

680
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:17,450
I’m not teasing you.

681
00:49:28,140 --> 00:49:28,940
Well...

682
00:49:31,290 --> 00:49:33,390
What is your reason for a kiss?

683
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:38,430
Don't say it's because of friendship, love, lust, etc.

684
00:49:38,430 --> 00:49:42,200
Your current expression is similar to
someone who proposes a duel.

685
00:49:43,470 --> 00:49:44,830
Almost.

686
00:49:44,830 --> 00:49:46,920
Because I'm going to duel with your fate.

687
00:49:49,510 --> 00:49:53,410
I want to keep my promise to you
before it's too late.

688
00:49:53,410 --> 00:49:54,490
Promise?

689
00:49:54,490 --> 00:49:57,270
No matter what the relationship
you had with Kim Pil-soo in the previous life,

690
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,760
I will change it in this life.
Didn't I promise you?

691
00:49:59,760 --> 00:50:03,450
So I have to figure out your past life
to make things better.

692
00:50:03,450 --> 00:50:05,930
But what does that have to do with kissing?

693
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:08,190
If a human being kisses a god,
the god can see her previous life.

694
00:50:08,190 --> 00:50:09,390
Does it make sense?

695
00:50:16,780 --> 00:50:18,390
Well.

696
00:50:18,390 --> 00:50:21,140
I guess it makes sense between us.

697
00:50:23,410 --> 00:50:27,020
But we did kiss each other before.

698
00:50:27,020 --> 00:50:30,840
If it’s true, why didn’t you see
my previous life at that time?

699
00:50:30,840 --> 00:50:33,610
Do you think kissing is
Han Gye-jeol's life theater?

700
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:35,700
I can't see all of it,

701
00:50:35,700 --> 00:50:38,880
just some of it every time we kiss.

702
00:50:41,250 --> 00:50:42,010
Really?

703
00:50:44,950 --> 00:50:50,340
Well...what was my life back then?

704
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:56,170
Was she living a happy life?

705
00:50:58,180 --> 00:50:59,370
Your love...

706
00:51:05,730 --> 00:51:08,230
is braver,

707
00:51:08,230 --> 00:51:09,570
Mr. O Hyeon.

708
00:51:17,560 --> 00:51:18,620
Mr. O Hyeon.

709
00:51:24,580 --> 00:51:26,100
more beautiful,

710
00:51:44,560 --> 00:51:46,710
and more dazzling than anyone else's.

711
00:51:52,720 --> 00:51:53,720
Really?

712
00:51:55,140 --> 00:51:59,120
Yes, I can tell that you were happy.

713
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:04,440
All right.

714
00:52:08,310 --> 00:52:11,930
There is no need to refuse something
to prevent misfortune, right?

715
00:53:29,010 --> 00:53:31,790
You who took his morning...

716
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:36,670
will never see it again.

717
00:53:44,510 --> 00:53:45,870
Kim Pil-soo.

718
00:53:47,550 --> 00:53:49,600
Deity, what happened?
Are you okay?

719
00:53:52,590 --> 00:53:53,320
What?

720
00:53:54,790 --> 00:53:57,350
Something happened to me?

721
00:53:57,350 --> 00:53:59,820
I didn’t end well?

722
00:54:01,800 --> 00:54:03,480
It’s a happy ending.

723
00:54:04,770 --> 00:54:07,400
You have 6 children

724
00:54:07,400 --> 00:54:09,160
and over 20 grandchildren.

725
00:54:10,210 --> 00:54:10,860
I didn't see Kim Pil-soo,

726
00:54:10,860 --> 00:54:12,650
and there was no danger anywhere.

727
00:54:13,460 --> 00:54:15,050
But why are you so angry?

728
00:54:17,140 --> 00:54:18,570
Because the relationship between
you two is so harmonious

729
00:54:19,090 --> 00:54:20,940
that I feel very jealous...

730
00:54:24,140 --> 00:54:25,070
I thought something was wrong.

731
00:54:30,080 --> 00:54:31,670
I hope this life will be different,

732
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:34,960
even if she can be a little better
because of me.

733
00:54:38,350 --> 00:54:40,880
God, please...

734
00:55:08,430 --> 00:55:09,300
Got it.

735
00:55:12,360 --> 00:55:14,060
I found... him!

736
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:31,050
Who is Nam Se-ri?

737
00:56:32,190 --> 00:56:35,920
Is Nam Se-ri Jeong I-deun?

738
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,200
Say it!

739
00:56:46,170 --> 00:56:47,100
Yes.

740
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,240
Don’t move.

741
00:57:09,050 --> 00:57:11,560
It's great to see you again, Choi Tae-hyung.

742
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:14,390
Let's get to know each other again.

743
00:57:15,410 --> 00:57:16,780
What’s your real name?

744
00:57:20,700 --> 00:57:23,180
Jeong I-deun's examination results come out.

745
00:57:25,260 --> 00:57:26,470
It's thyroid cancer.

746
00:57:31,710 --> 00:57:34,690
Jeong I-deun accepted many times of inspections.

747
00:57:34,690 --> 00:57:37,880
But is it possible that it was never found out?

748
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:45,490
Those tests were all done at Pilseong Hospital.

749
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,050
Lord Deity.

750
00:57:56,050 --> 00:57:57,100
I’m going to kill them.

751
00:57:58,230 --> 00:58:00,320
Whether it's Pilseong Hospital or Pilseong Bio,

752
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,190
journalists or politicians,

753
00:58:02,190 --> 00:58:04,950
I'm going to kill all the jerks
who make harmful drugs,

754
00:58:06,410 --> 00:58:09,880
although tearing them into pieces
doesn't calm me down...

755
00:58:09,880 --> 00:58:11,920
Killing a few people won't solve any problems,

756
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:14,050
we have to prepare countermeasures.

757
00:58:14,050 --> 00:58:17,360
Of course, Jeong I-deun's cancer
is now stage 1

758
00:58:17,360 --> 00:58:18,900
and completely curable.

759
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:22,260
We can let him receive treatment
soon after the press conference.

760
00:58:22,260 --> 00:58:23,180
What press conference?

761
00:58:24,070 --> 00:58:25,850
The fact that one will get cancer
after taking that medicine

762
00:58:25,850 --> 00:58:27,350
should be made public.

763
00:58:27,350 --> 00:58:29,910
The only person who can testify now
is Jeong I-deun.

764
00:58:33,740 --> 00:58:34,780
Not Jeong I-deun.

765
00:58:37,020 --> 00:58:38,680
Send him away, whether it's
the United States or somewhere,

766
00:58:38,680 --> 00:58:40,140
and let him receive treatment there.

767
00:58:40,140 --> 00:58:42,620
Why? Because of fate?

768
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:45,960
Are you worried about
what will happen after he helps you?

769
00:58:47,940 --> 00:58:49,140
I will not let him get involved
in my affairs

770
00:58:51,410 --> 00:58:53,170
in this life.

771
00:58:53,940 --> 00:58:55,050
Find another way.

772
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:17,430
What’s the karma with Kim Pil-soo?

773
00:59:31,950 --> 00:59:32,790
Lord Deity.

774
00:59:36,960 --> 00:59:37,820
Really?

775
00:59:37,820 --> 00:59:40,220
-You did catch him?
-Of course.

776
00:59:40,220 --> 00:59:41,560
I'm Han Chul.

777
00:59:41,560 --> 00:59:43,880
Will I spare the person who wants to kill me?

778
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,950
My brother is awesome.

779
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:48,030
But the superior has already called

780
00:59:48,030 --> 00:59:49,730
to transfer him to another group.

781
00:59:50,580 --> 00:59:51,840
It must be because of Kim Pil-soo, right?

782
00:59:51,840 --> 00:59:55,270
Yes, so I want to confirm something first
and call you in as a witness.

783
00:59:55,270 --> 00:59:57,200
-Okay?
-Yes.

784
01:00:02,210 --> 01:00:03,190
Hello.

785
01:00:07,110 --> 01:00:09,610
-Are you ready?
-Yes.

786
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:11,840
Tae Jung-sik.

787
01:00:30,320 --> 01:00:31,430
Yes.

788
01:00:33,440 --> 01:00:35,950
Right, that’s him.

789
01:00:54,930 --> 01:00:55,870
Sister, how are you?

790
01:00:55,870 --> 01:00:57,280
Are you okay?

791
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:02,160
I’m fine.

792
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:04,790
I just have a headache.

793
01:01:17,610 --> 01:01:19,690
The ending God has ordained
has always been tragedy,

794
01:01:19,690 --> 01:01:21,330
and there is no joy in His world

795
01:01:21,330 --> 01:01:23,790
because he can't bear the happy look
of human beings.

796
01:01:34,960 --> 01:01:39,410
The wound won't heal.
What’s going on?

797
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:42,270
I've lived for a thousand years and
this is the first time I've seen this happen.

798
01:01:42,270 --> 01:01:45,250
Since you have lived for a thousand years,
of course you will see various situations.

799
01:01:45,250 --> 01:01:46,760
Why all the fuss?

800
01:01:46,760 --> 01:01:48,730
Well...

801
01:01:48,730 --> 01:01:50,840
We need to know exactly why this is happening.

802
01:01:50,840 --> 01:01:53,250
If this continues, something serious will happen.

803
01:01:53,250 --> 01:01:55,830
As for the reason...

804
01:01:56,760 --> 01:01:58,190
Could it be because of that?

805
01:01:58,200 --> 01:01:59,600
What?

806
01:02:01,040 --> 01:02:02,890
The moment I was stabbed by the knife

807
01:02:02,890 --> 01:02:04,950
gave me a sense of vision,

808
01:02:04,950 --> 01:02:06,950
as if I had been

809
01:02:06,950 --> 01:02:08,690
injured here before.

810
01:02:08,690 --> 01:02:11,650
Did the wound get stabbed again
so it got worse?

811
01:02:12,650 --> 01:02:14,490
The wound was stabbed again...

812
01:02:16,390 --> 01:02:18,870
Even I can't possibly know
all the truths in the world.

813
01:02:18,870 --> 01:02:20,560
After all, I am not the Creator.

814
01:02:21,790 --> 01:02:23,850
-Creator?
-Yes.

815
01:02:27,090 --> 01:02:28,320
I got it.

816
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:32,410
Lord Deity, this...

817
01:02:33,810 --> 01:02:34,910
It’s a precursor.

818
01:02:34,910 --> 01:02:36,910
An ominous precursor.

819
01:02:36,910 --> 01:02:38,360
Precursor?

820
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:42,450
As the god of the dead, your wanting to
stay in the mortal world

821
01:02:42,450 --> 01:02:46,170
might disrupt the order of
the mortal world and the underworld.

822
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:48,970
How can the Creator sit idly by?

823
01:02:48,970 --> 01:02:50,430
So...

824
01:02:51,590 --> 01:02:53,590
He showed you in advance that

825
01:02:54,770 --> 01:02:59,480
if you stayed in the mortal world
and went against God's mission,

826
01:02:59,480 --> 01:03:02,200
what kind of pain and scars

827
01:03:02,200 --> 01:03:04,880
you would face.

828
01:03:16,350 --> 01:03:18,750
The broken ones can be repaired.

829
01:03:20,210 --> 01:03:23,790
Why so disturbed?

830
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,450
Excuse me.

831
01:03:47,080 --> 01:03:48,670
Hello.

832
01:03:49,530 --> 01:03:50,520
Well...

833
01:03:50,520 --> 01:03:55,040
Well...I'm here to fix a ring.

834
01:04:00,840 --> 01:04:01,870
Okay.

835
01:04:01,870 --> 01:04:03,030
What about later?

836
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:04,560
What happened?

837
01:04:04,560 --> 01:04:07,450
They were severely punished.

838
01:04:09,450 --> 01:04:10,840
Oh.

839
01:04:10,840 --> 01:04:12,560
Granny.

840
01:04:12,560 --> 01:04:14,050
It was you

841
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,630
at Eonju Hospital, right?

842
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:17,250
Exactly.

843
01:04:18,470 --> 01:04:21,120
How are your hands?

844
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,670
All right.

845
01:04:22,670 --> 01:04:25,390
Maybe it's because of the doctor's
awesome ability

846
01:04:25,390 --> 01:04:28,000
that my hands are normal now.

847
01:04:28,000 --> 01:04:29,390
Great.

848
01:04:29,390 --> 01:04:32,390
But it's amazing that we met here.

849
01:04:32,390 --> 01:04:34,570
This is the fate.

850
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:37,630
People who should meet
will meet sooner or later.

851
01:04:39,430 --> 01:04:41,120
By the way, this...

852
01:04:41,120 --> 01:04:43,150
Can the ring be fixed?

853
01:04:49,230 --> 01:04:50,910
If it’s fixed, would you still wear it?

854
01:04:50,910 --> 01:04:52,170
Yes.

855
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:55,310
Just as there is fate between people,

856
01:04:55,310 --> 01:04:58,790
there is also fate between people and things.

857
01:04:58,790 --> 01:05:02,920
Something is wrong from the start,

858
01:05:02,920 --> 01:05:06,410
and will drive its master into misfortune.

859
01:05:07,830 --> 01:05:10,080
You healed my hand before,
so I want to say something to you.

860
01:05:11,390 --> 01:05:13,510
You’d better give up this ring.

861
01:05:17,870 --> 01:05:19,600
No way.

862
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,230
It’s priceless.

863
01:05:22,230 --> 01:05:24,280
How priceless is it?

864
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,770
It cannot be measured by price.

865
01:05:32,230 --> 01:05:35,000
If it can't be repaired here,
I'll go to another place.

866
01:06:30,350 --> 01:06:36,450
You said that heather blooms
in the mortal world and the underworld, right?

867
01:06:36,450 --> 01:06:39,960
Although I wish us to bloom together
whether life or death,

868
01:06:39,960 --> 01:06:42,990
we can't be together in this life.

869
01:06:45,130 --> 01:06:47,350
This is for you.

870
01:06:59,960 --> 01:07:03,400
Tonight, the sedan chair team will stay
on the mountain near Jeodong.

871
01:07:03,400 --> 01:07:06,710
Please hide in the cave
and I will pick you up.

872
01:07:06,710 --> 01:07:10,050
Have you forgotten
where I am going now?

873
01:07:10,050 --> 01:07:13,840
Both of our families would be slaughtered
if I disappeared.

874
01:07:13,840 --> 01:07:17,470
The country will perish,
and there will be a bloodbath.

875
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,290
O Hyeon!

876
01:07:24,510 --> 01:07:26,190
O Hyeon!

877
01:07:26,190 --> 01:07:27,830
Let me go!

878
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,120
No!

879
01:07:39,670 --> 01:07:43,520
O Hyeon, no!

880
01:07:55,950 --> 01:07:58,170
Even if I can forget myself,

881
01:07:59,880 --> 01:08:02,890
how can I forget you?

882
01:08:05,250 --> 01:08:06,760
You who suffered

883
01:08:07,800 --> 01:08:09,680
because of me...

884
01:08:25,510 --> 01:08:31,120
Tribute girl lost her beloved

885
01:08:31,120 --> 01:08:34,240
and committed suicide again and again
in the mortal world.

886
01:08:35,800 --> 01:08:38,990
The samurai was bound forever
on the road to the underworld,

887
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:41,229
becoming Deity.

888
01:08:41,229 --> 01:08:44,710
It was their punishment that

889
01:08:44,710 --> 01:08:47,960
they could never see each other again.

890
01:09:04,210 --> 01:09:06,229
What to do?

891
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:09,010
You died because of me.

892
01:10:01,520 --> 01:10:03,770
What a sad winter.

893
01:10:03,770 --> 01:10:06,210
After this season is over,

894
01:10:08,210 --> 01:10:10,470
will you

895
01:10:10,470 --> 01:10:12,370
usher in

896
01:10:13,730 --> 01:10:15,730
a splendid spring?

897
01:10:37,110 --> 01:10:40,780
(Next episode preview)

898
01:10:41,450 --> 01:10:44,040
Do you still remember Seol Hui?

899
01:10:44,040 --> 01:10:48,650
If Seol Hui appeared, would you be happy?

900
01:10:48,650 --> 01:10:49,720
No.

901
01:10:49,720 --> 01:10:52,750
She may suffer in my absence.

902
01:10:52,750 --> 01:10:55,640
Just because of this, I can't let you go.

903
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,510
It’s time to end.

904
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:00,030
I want to be somebody

905
01:11:00,030 --> 01:11:02,030
with no memories

906
01:11:02,030 --> 01:11:04,030
or experiences.

907
01:11:06,000 --> 01:11:07,730
Let’s break up.
