1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:00,690
I’ve said Do Jin-woo can never come back.

2
00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,910
(Episode 6)
I’ve said Do Jin-woo can never come back.

3
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:02,980
Why?

4
00:00:02,980 --> 00:00:06,110
I, the Deity, am alive with my eyes wide opened. How could he come back?

5
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,560
Then just disappear, Deity.

6
00:00:09,560 --> 00:00:10,660
What?

7
00:00:10,660 --> 00:00:13,560
I said, you, Deity, just disappear.

8
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:16,810
Please, disappear.

9
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:30,810
Professor.

10
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:33,310
Professor Do.

11
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:39,140
Professor, Professor, wake up!

12
00:00:39,140 --> 00:00:42,260
Professor, wake up!

13
00:00:43,080 --> 00:00:45,210
Professor!

14
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:48,670
Wake up, Professor!

15
00:00:51,630 --> 00:00:56,830
Am I back to the underworld?

16
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,110
There’s no pulse.

17
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:21,420
Professor, wake up, Professor!

18
00:01:22,410 --> 00:01:25,080
I have been far too outspoken.

19
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:27,860
Don’t disappear!

20
00:01:27,860 --> 00:01:30,890
Deity, come back!

21
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:34,350
Come back, Deity!

22
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:39,400
No matter you are Professor or Deity, it’s fine.

23
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:42,780
I won’t nag you anymore.

24
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:48,450
Please, come back!

25
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:58,500
You should keep your promise.

26
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:01,670
Deity.

27
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:08,340
What have you done to me?

28
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:10,900
Are you ok, Deity?

29
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:13,480
Do you feel sick?

30
00:02:14,230 --> 00:02:15,620
Hum.

31
00:02:17,060 --> 00:02:18,900
You wanted me to die, but you saved my life afterwards.

32
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:21,210
How talented you are!

33
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:34,790
I thought you were actually dead!

34
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,020
You…

35
00:03:01,190 --> 00:03:04,070
That day will come, sooner or later.

36
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:07,210
You poisonous miss,

37
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,780
will redeem me with death.

38
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,250
Ahh, you...

39
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:19,630
You haven’t hurt your leg. Why are you doing this?

40
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:22,480
(Boom boom boom, cheerful sound of firecrackers fireworks)
You haven’t hurt your leg. Why are you doing this?

41
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:23,660
To be honest,
(Boom boom boom, cheerful sound of firecrackers fireworks)

42
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:24,250
do you do this to take care of me or to have skin-to-skin contact with me?
(Boom boom boom, cheerful sound of firecrackers fireworks)

43
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,480
do you do this to take care of me or to have skin-to-skin contact with me?

44
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:28,530
Do you want me to tell you from the first cervical vertebra

45
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:30,579
in such a tight embrace?

46
00:03:30,579 --> 00:03:32,730
You must feel very good.

47
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:36,650
Hey, killing me once a day is enough. Dying is not something good.

48
00:03:36,650 --> 00:03:38,579
Didn’t you say that you are the king of the road to hades?

49
00:03:38,579 --> 00:03:43,100
For you, aren’t the underworld and the world the same? And doesn’t the death equal to the life?

50
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,050
It used to be that case.

51
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:51,980
But after I’ve met you,

52
00:03:52,810 --> 00:03:55,230
the world is worth my expectation.

53
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,620
If the world is worth your expectation, you have to be careful.

54
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:04,190
Cardiac arrests two times already. That’s no joke.

55
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:08,280
The source of the heart problem is you.

56
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,370
So you’re the one who should be careful.

57
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:14,080
The problem? Me? What is it?

58
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:19,649
Ah, is it my beauty causing cardiac arrest?

59
00:04:23,130 --> 00:04:27,280
This illusion really makes people go into cardiac arrest!

60
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,490
Finally I know why some people come to the underworld because of anger.

61
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,620
I was just trying to make you laugh. It was a slip of the tongue.

62
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:37,770
It is a groping allegation.

63
00:04:37,770 --> 00:04:39,230
Are these two different?

64
00:04:39,230 --> 00:04:41,640
A slip of the tongue is a mistake and a groping allegation is a delusion.

65
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:44,440
You didn’t make a mistake but had a delusion that you want to get someone killed.

66
00:04:44,440 --> 00:04:47,770
Are you a doctor of linguistics? Why did you take what I’ve said so seriously?

67
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:50,600
Whatever it is, I’m trying to let you be careful of your words.

68
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:51,840
Be careful of my words?

69
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,520
Why should I be careful with this?

70
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:57,820
Because your single word will let me rush between the world and the underworld.

71
00:04:58,830 --> 00:05:00,650
Are you...

72
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:03,530
Are you saying that you fainted because of my word?

73
00:05:03,530 --> 00:05:05,500
Because you were stimulated?

74
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,200
It can’t be.

75
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:14,860
How can’t you be stimulated or hurt after hearing such a curse?

76
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,720
Don’t take it for granted that if you see a handsome and young face,

77
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:19,310
you think his heart is the same.

78
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:22,730
The foundation is already worn out after thousands of years.

79
00:05:22,730 --> 00:05:25,400
It’s not surprising even if I faint immediately.

80
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,850
If what I said is a groping allegation, what you said are bad words.

81
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,420
Bad words are bad for mental health.

82
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:31,940
The Deity is a disgrace and a nuisance. Just disappear.

83
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:34,290
These are bad words, to be frank.

84
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,659
I’m sorry.

85
00:05:38,659 --> 00:05:41,900
Doctor Han Gye-jeol has told me not to be anxious,

86
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:44,800
but it seems hard for Han Gye-jeol as a normal person to do so.

87
00:05:45,760 --> 00:05:48,840
I will bear a little bit more and try harder.

88
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:57,740
Just bearing a little bit is not enough.

89
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:00,530
You can kill people with your word.

90
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:03,910
So, never say something like...

91
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:06,010
disappear, Deity.

92
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:11,540
Otherwise, the Deity you know will disappear like bubbles.

93
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,130
Like the mermaid princess?

94
00:06:18,130 --> 00:06:22,080
Wow, that sounds like a fairy tale.

95
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:24,660
All fairy tales have a cruel ending.

96
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:27,890
Because human will always do what is prohibited.

97
00:06:27,890 --> 00:06:32,720
Don’t worry, I’ve said, I’m not interested in bad endings.

98
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:38,070
I will never, never, ever say to let you disappear again.

99
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:39,640
Come.

100
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:56,300
Let me trust you this time.

101
00:07:08,890 --> 00:07:11,830
I’ve said, I’m all right.

102
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:14,250
I’ve already made an appointment for neurology and circulatory examination.

103
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:15,150
Just do them all.

104
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:16,180
Is it necessary to do so many examinations?

105
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,640
I’m fine.

106
00:07:17,640 --> 00:07:19,160
There’s no need to bother doing so many examinations.

107
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:22,270
No, you can’t be ill.

108
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,520
What happened?

109
00:07:24,140 --> 00:07:26,030
What happened? Who are you?

110
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:27,250
Who are you?

111
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,730
President, it is ready.

112
00:07:28,730 --> 00:07:30,430
The president is here.

113
00:07:36,220 --> 00:07:38,440
Are you a gangster? What are you doing with so many people?

114
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,890
What gangster are you talking about?

115
00:07:40,890 --> 00:07:43,150
You are the president I Eung-chul?

116
00:07:43,150 --> 00:07:47,720
Yes, it’s me. I’m I Eung-chul of Buhwa Company. You know me?

117
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,900
How can one who never reads the news recognize Eung-chul?

118
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,760
I have six shares of this company.

119
00:07:55,390 --> 00:08:00,480
As the shares dived, you should be busy with your work. Why are you here?

120
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,770
Though you can’t say it has completely dived, it is all over.
(“busy” and “all over” are homophones)

121
00:08:02,770 --> 00:08:04,660
What else can he do? He comes to pick me up.

122
00:08:04,660 --> 00:08:06,760
Wait. What’s your relationship with him?

123
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,670
The busy president just comes and picks you up?

124
00:08:08,670 --> 00:08:10,360
I’m that guy’s… Shut up.

125
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:12,050
Let me tell you.

126
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:17,130
The so-called plutocrat, should take care of the health and the welfare of every worker.

127
00:08:17,130 --> 00:08:19,350
And that’s the secret to the longevity of a century- old company called Buhwa.

128
00:08:19,350 --> 00:08:20,820
We will not shut down. Don’t worry.

129
00:08:20,820 --> 00:08:24,620
Staff, just go.

130
00:08:24,620 --> 00:08:26,770
What happened, staff?

131
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:31,770
Please, let’s go.

132
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:35,080
Please, just go.

133
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,480
Brother.

134
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:39,150
Brother Eung-chul.

135
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:40,909
Why are you denying my existence?

136
00:08:40,909 --> 00:08:42,549
Do you feel ashamed of me?

137
00:08:42,549 --> 00:08:43,590
Brother.

138
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,310
No…

139
00:08:46,230 --> 00:08:47,610
Brother?

140
00:08:50,250 --> 00:08:52,500
Brother?

141
00:08:53,620 --> 00:08:57,220
I’ve said the stock will goes down! You useless thing!

142
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,900
Right.

143
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:02,540
The so-called plutocrat should have a secret of birth.

144
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,650
That’s right.

145
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:06,050
Before things get worse after they know this,

146
00:09:06,050 --> 00:09:08,300
And with the dived stock,

147
00:09:08,300 --> 00:09:10,490
I have to take him back.

148
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:13,870
You, come on! Go back with me.

149
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:15,400
Interesting.

150
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,970
-But, wait! -What?

151
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:19,700
Even if you are worrying about the stock,

152
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:23,450
are you taking the patient without treating him?

153
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,380
Is our professor so-called

154
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,990
punching bag?

155
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:33,660
If you cry here, it will be very weird.

156
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:38,540
I am the one with sense of justice, so I can’t let this happen.

157
00:09:38,540 --> 00:09:40,380
Please, have a good rest here.

158
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,350
I will send you back after the examination.

159
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:46,340
Please don’t. There’s too many examinations to do.

160
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,750
-I’m fine, it’s okay to leave now. - Let’s go.

161
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,110
- Eung-chul, let’s go. - Go.

162
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,090
Just two more examinations...

163
00:09:51,090 --> 00:09:53,400
I’ve said, you have to rest.

164

Let’s go.

166
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,140
What happened?

167
00:10:06,140 --> 00:10:09,260
Good boy, now sleep.

168
00:10:17,450 --> 00:10:19,720
Oh, he’s snoring.

169
00:10:25,690 --> 00:10:28,470
Han Gye-jeol is commanding Lord Deity like commanding a slave?

170
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,060
Does this make sense?

171
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,570
Of course it doesn’t.

172
00:10:31,570 --> 00:10:33,820
If I didn’t see it with my own eyes, I don’t believe it either.

173
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:36,010
You have got to see how he obeyed like a dog.

174
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:37,330
How many times should I tell you?

175
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:39,780
I’ve said that is an aftereffect of my empathy.

176
00:10:39,780 --> 00:10:41,400
I dug my own grave.

177
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:45,430
The most important is, it’s true that she sent you back to the underworld.

178
00:10:45,430 --> 00:10:48,350
What? How can a human be able to do this?

179
00:10:48,350 --> 00:10:50,680
Can she save the dead if it continues?

180
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:52,450
What nonsense are you talking about?

181
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:54,660
How can you save a person who has already stepped in the road to hades?

182
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:55,590
I am worried.

183
00:10:55,590 --> 00:10:57,920
I am worried because nobody knows how far it will goes.

184

The Lord will make asses of himself for many times.

185

At that time, disappear, leave, get out of my way!

186

That kind of things… sounds good.

187
00:11:15,390 --> 00:11:19,570
Confessing is tiring enough. The process is full of difficulties.

188
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:25,400
What are you doing?

189
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:31,680
If you dare to talk nonsense again, I’ll kill you.

190
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:42,130
Lord Deity, why don’t you just imitate Do Jin-woo?

191
00:11:42,130 --> 00:11:42,730
What?

192
00:11:42,730 --> 00:11:45,050
If you let her believe that you are Do Jin-woo,

193
00:11:45,050 --> 00:11:47,690
she’ll never let you disappear.

194
00:11:47,690 --> 00:11:49,770
Then it will be easy to accept her confession.

195
00:11:49,770 --> 00:11:51,370
Because she likes Do Jin-woo.

196
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:55,780
It’s two birds with one stone. A nice bargain.

197

Ok Shin, I’m the unbeatable king of the road to hades.

You let me to imitate a normal human?

Is there a dog barking? I’ve heard a dog barking.

The liar and Do Jin-woo. Aren’t you casual?

324
00:19:01,590 --> 00:19:02,700
And you say you believe in fate.

325
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:05,810
It seems that your fate is as many as the stars in the night sky.

326
00:19:05,810 --> 00:19:08,810
Why are you saying this now?

327
00:19:08,810 --> 00:19:13,480
You're not jealous, are you?

328
00:19:13,480 --> 00:19:17,010
Jealousy? What is that?

329
00:19:17,010 --> 00:19:19,660
Jealousy has been a bad behavior since ancient times.

330
00:19:19,660 --> 00:19:22,230
And a god is not inferior.

331
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:24,430
So there is no such word as jealousy for a god.

332
00:19:24,430 --> 00:19:26,360
Jealous, you must be joking.

333
00:19:26,360 --> 00:19:29,230
Didn’t you say there is no such word as hardworking for a god?

334
00:19:29,230 --> 00:19:31,300
How come there is no jealousy?

335
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:32,960
How come there are so many things that don't exist?

336
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,940
No wonder why my prayers didn't come true.

337
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:37,040
So it's all because of a lack of vocabulary.

338
00:19:37,040 --> 00:19:39,690
It's because gods don't understand human language.

339
00:19:42,750 --> 00:19:44,830
It's not only an insult to the person that counts as an insult.

340
00:19:44,830 --> 00:19:46,100
Insulting the gods is also an insult.

341
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:50,300
Apologize, come, come and apologize.

342
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,260
No!

343
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,630
Just apologize.

344
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,150
Were you happy?

345
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,060
What?

346
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:58,120
Just like the snowflakes in summer.

347
00:19:58,120 --> 00:20:00,890
Like the fifth season.

348
00:20:00,890 --> 00:20:02,330
It's like a new paradise.

349
00:20:02,330 --> 00:20:03,310
So were you happy?

350
00:20:03,310 --> 00:20:04,220
(Feiyun Clinic)
So were you happy?

351
00:20:04,220 --> 00:20:04,600
(Feiyun Clinic)

352
00:20:04,600 --> 00:20:06,990
It's like seeing the world's most unique scenery.
(Feiyun Clinic)

353
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,560
It's like meeting the only season in the world.

354
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:13,460
It's like experiencing the greatest joy in the world.

355
00:20:14,230 --> 00:20:15,940
A guy said that his first kiss was like that.

356
00:20:15,940 --> 00:20:16,840
Yours too?

357
00:20:17,270 --> 00:20:19,080
Oh my God, why do you ask such a question?

358
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:19,960
You're so nasty!

359
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:21,880
Nasty?

360
00:20:21,880 --> 00:20:25,680
It's only natural for a god to explore the past and present of human beings.

361
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,960
How can you call that nasty?

362
00:20:28,540 --> 00:20:31,010
Humans call this kind of nasty inquiry

363
00:20:31,010 --> 00:20:33,740
jealous.

364
00:20:36,350 --> 00:20:37,770
I said I don't know what jealousy is.

365
00:20:38,590 --> 00:20:39,400
Why are you leaving first again?

366
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:41,600
(Feiyun Clinic)

367
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:42,300
Good.
(Feiyun Clinic)

368
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:43,330
Very good.

370
00:20:45,410 --> 00:20:45,480
Thank you.
(Feiyun Clinic)

371
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:46,330
Thank you.

372
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,030
It must cost you a lot living together.

373
00:20:50,030 --> 00:20:51,780
If you have difficulties, just tell us.

374
00:20:52,060 --> 00:20:54,200
What, we are…

375
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:56,350
Didn’t you say that Johns couldn’t even earn the bread?

376
00:20:56,990 --> 00:20:59,730
To come so far away and support a man should be very tired ah.

377
00:20:59,730 --> 00:21:01,800
Hong-geun has always been worried about you.

378
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,820
There seems to be a misunderstanding.

379
00:21:07,180 --> 00:21:08,870
Thank you for worrying about us.

380
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,330
It costs a lot of money to buy medicine.

381
00:21:11,330 --> 00:21:13,130
And there are many places to spend money

382
00:21:13,130 --> 00:21:14,600
I was worried for a long time.

383
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:16,810
You should have told us earlier.

384
00:21:16,810 --> 00:21:18,610
I'll help you from now on.

385
00:21:19,010 --> 00:21:21,620
Even though Hong-geun seems to have nothing to do every day,

386
00:21:21,620 --> 00:21:23,390
but in our village, we can do something.

387
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,910
To be honest, is it because they think our meat is good

388
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:26,160
that the people come and eat in out restaurant?

389
00:21:26,710 --> 00:21:28,170
It's all because of my old man.

390
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:32,470
Our Dr. Han is lucky.

391
00:21:33,810 --> 00:21:35,590
Even though your man is not capable,

392
00:21:35,590 --> 00:21:37,430
but he's innocent enough.

393
00:21:37,810 --> 00:21:38,790
Of course I will help you.

394
00:21:39,340 --> 00:21:40,450
Innocent?

395
00:21:41,310 --> 00:21:42,360
Of course.

396
00:21:43,570 --> 00:21:46,070
You're using me for sympathy now, right?

397
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:48,000
Just cooperate.

398
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,210
I’ll pay you.

399
00:21:49,210 --> 00:21:50,020
How much?

400
00:21:55,490 --> 00:21:56,790
That’s right.

401
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,590
You should be loving each other.

402
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,080
Look at you guys.

403
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,080
I remember when we were newlyweds.

404
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,770
Dr. Han looks exactly like me when I was young.

405
00:22:07,770 --> 00:22:09,240
What? Do we look similar?

406
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,030
You're a real jerk.

407
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:13,360
He's so shy.

408
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:15,610
So when are you getting married?

409
00:22:16,190 --> 00:22:17,270
Is it a wedding first?

410
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:20,460
Or will you wait until he gets his memories back?

411
00:22:21,260 --> 00:22:25,380
The ... wedding is not yet

412
00:22:25,790 --> 00:22:26,800
What are you talking about?

413
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:34,700
Why should my Jin-woo get married to you?

414
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:36,920
My

415
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:37,810
Jin-woo.

416
00:22:38,260 --> 00:22:40,170
We agreed to never do anything behind the scenes.

417
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:42,270
What are you doing?

418
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:44,540
It's not.

419
00:22:45,140 --> 00:22:46,120
This is a misunderstanding.

420
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:49,130
Let's go. I'll explain everything to you.

421
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:54,380
No, I think the elders have a deep misunderstanding.

422
00:22:54,740 --> 00:22:55,880
We must solve the problem here.

423
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:57,470
You explain it.

424
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,410
Why will my boyfriend marry you?

425
00:23:01,410 --> 00:23:02,680
Why do all the people in Yeongpo

426
00:23:02,680 --> 00:23:04,260
know about this except me?

427
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,510
Johns, do you have two lovers?

428
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,890
With this plastic surgery beauty?

429
00:23:09,890 --> 00:23:12,130
No plastic surgery. I'm a natural beauty.

430
00:23:12,700 --> 00:23:14,290
He is not two-timing me. I'm the victim.

431
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:15,490
Victim?

432
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:18,120
Actually, because my boyfriend has lost his memory,

433
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:20,780
Dr. Han lied that she was his girlfriend

434
00:23:20,780 --> 00:23:22,670
so I'm the victim.

435
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,500
Is that true, Dr. Han?

436
00:23:26,800 --> 00:23:27,970
It can’t be.

437
00:23:27,970 --> 00:23:30,050
I've always been a good judge of character.

438
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,350
I'm sorry.

439
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:40,100
Oh my God, that's not right.

440
00:23:40,670 --> 00:23:43,790
That's not true...

441
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:44,790
Jeong-won, that’s enough.

442
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:48,360
Jin-woo?

443
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,090
You're the one who said you wanted to break up first.

444
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:51,690
What are you doing now?

445
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,250
You don't have amnesia, do you?

446
00:23:59,130 --> 00:24:00,440
You said you wanted to break up again.

447
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:00,930
(August 10, 2022: You said you want to break up again, so I replied break up then)
You said you wanted to break up again.

448

(August 10, 2022: You said you want to break up again, so I replied break up then)

449
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,790
I also said let's break up then.
(August 10, 2022: You said you want to break up again, so I replied break up then)

450
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,660
You said you wanted to break up again.

451
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,990
I also said let's break up then. Right?

452
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:09,800
Do you really remember that?

453
00:24:12,910 --> 00:24:15,490
People fight a lot when they're in love.

454
00:24:15,490 --> 00:24:17,960
It's not the first time I've said I want to break up.

455
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,940
But it is the first time I've said it.

456
00:24:19,940 --> 00:24:21,470
I didn't admit it.

457
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:23,730
Breakup does not require any admission, Jeong-won.

458
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:25,950
Just accept it.

459
00:24:29,880 --> 00:24:31,380
Sorry to bother you.

460
00:24:34,660 --> 00:24:35,320
Let's go.

461
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:38,590
What...

462
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:46,260
(August 10, 2022: You said you want to break up again, so I replied break up then)

00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,400
I also said let's break up then.
(August 10, 2022: You said you want to break up again, so I replied break up then)

466
00:24:52,650 --> 00:24:54,240
This man is really

467
00:24:54,810 --> 00:24:57,200
interesting, when I get to know him more.

468
00:25:01,970 --> 00:25:02,690
Professor.

469
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:04,870
Professor.

470
00:25:04,870 --> 00:25:06,780
You call me professor again!

471
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,800
Do you really remember everything?

472
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:10,230
Have you recovered all your memories?

473
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,840
What's wrong?

474
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:12,840
What's wrong?

475
00:25:13,150 --> 00:25:14,930
When did you get your memory back?

476
00:25:14,930 --> 00:25:16,130
Why didn't you tell me?

477
00:25:16,640 --> 00:25:18,470
You had many chances to tell me, right?

478
00:25:18,470 --> 00:25:20,390
Is it my duty to tell you?

479
00:25:20,740 --> 00:25:21,980
Why do you need to know that?

480
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:24,430
You haven't changed since I got my memory back, have you?

481
00:25:24,430 --> 00:25:26,080
How could there is no change?

482
00:25:27,110 --> 00:25:27,850
This will be different.

483
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:28,680
(Feiyun Clinic)
This will be different.

484
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:31,470
Look,

485
00:25:31,470 --> 00:25:34,290
the propaganda of the hospital is actually the resume to publicize the doctors.

486
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:37,060
As you know, my resume is not good enough.

487
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,350
Of course,

488
00:25:38,350 --> 00:25:40,540
my ability is still very impressive.

489
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:43,530
But only if a patient comes to the hospital for treatment first,

490
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:44,710
then can my ability be seen.

491
00:25:45,270 --> 00:25:47,530
But if it is written here that

492
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,660
graduated from Johns Hopkins University in the U.S.,

493
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,600
the Chief of Planning Office at Seoul Pilseong Hospital.

494
00:25:52,070 --> 00:25:54,030
With these two words,

495
00:25:55,530 --> 00:25:56,620
we will win.

496
00:25:56,620 --> 00:25:58,290
Did I say I wanted to put that name up there?

497
00:25:58,290 --> 00:26:00,550
You know that name theft is a felony, right?

498
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:02,770
Landlord,

499
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:04,400
if you want to receive the rent,

500
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:05,620
please help me.

501
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:08,030
When you heard that I recovered my memory,

502
00:26:08,030 --> 00:26:09,830
all you can think of is hospital publicity?

503
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:11,650
Shouldn't you ask me when I got it back?

504
00:26:11,650 --> 00:26:12,430
Why didn't you tell me?

505
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,020
These usual questions.

506
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,220
I've just asked.

507
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,540
If I ask you again, will you answer me?

508
00:26:19,040 --> 00:26:21,360
Why are you pretending that you're not Do Jin-woo until now?

509
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:22,640
Will you tell me?

510
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:26,730
Although I don’t fully understand you, Professor.

511
00:26:27,930 --> 00:26:30,390
I often dislike myself.

512
00:26:32,410 --> 00:26:36,430
I feel that I am useless, mediocre, timid, and have no courage.

513
00:26:36,940 --> 00:26:38,190
I feel that I am very useless.

514
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,640
I've tried to get out of my daily life, and I've tried my best,

515
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:44,470
but I've come back to my original position eventually.

516
00:26:45,380 --> 00:26:46,400
Because even if I am like this,

517
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,650
there will be people who need me and welcome me.

518
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:53,680
Do you think

519
00:26:54,430 --> 00:26:56,730
your place is where Do Jin-woo will return?

520
00:26:57,360 --> 00:26:59,180
You don't even ask him what he thinks and take the place?

521
00:26:59,180 --> 00:27:00,730
Don't you think you're cheeky?

522
00:27:01,660 --> 00:27:03,620
What have you heard so far?

523
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:06,710
You may not like yourself very much or be tired,

524
00:27:06,710 --> 00:27:10,070
but the place where you are always needed

525
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,500
is here. That's the point.

526
00:27:15,140 --> 00:27:17,710
Welcome back. Welcome.

527
00:27:18,250 --> 00:27:20,640
It always needs me, right?

528
00:27:22,340 --> 00:27:24,990
You always call me Deity, but you think I’m Do Jin-woo.

529
00:27:25,350 --> 00:27:27,170
I thought it was you and me lying in bed.

530
00:27:27,170 --> 00:27:28,540
Now I realized there were three of us.

531
00:27:28,540 --> 00:27:30,440
What kind of weird urban story is this?

532
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:34,210
Oh my god, when did we lie in the same bed again?

533
00:27:35,970 --> 00:27:37,100
What if someone hears us?

534
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:39,490
Whose marriage will be obstructed?

535
00:27:39,950 --> 00:27:42,410
If who you need is always the disappearing Do Jin-woo,

536
00:27:42,410 --> 00:27:43,240
what about Deity?

537
00:27:44,830 --> 00:27:45,810
If Deity disappears,

538
00:27:46,910 --> 00:27:48,160
will you still need him so much?

539
00:27:52,380 --> 00:27:53,520
Will you still be waiting him at all times?

540
00:27:54,020 --> 00:27:56,080
And welcome him back at any time?

541
00:28:07,890 --> 00:28:09,610
The place where Deity can come back to

542
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,100
does not exist.

543
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:18,420
Well...

544
00:28:28,360 --> 00:28:30,960
Am I too pushy again?

545
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:37,090
Ms. Gim Hyeon-ji, your gastroscopy

546
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:39,040
revealed the presence of H. pylori.

547
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,990
I'll give you the medicine for a week.

548
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:44,730
Even if it's strong, keep taking it.

549
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,330
Don't stop taking it.

550
00:28:48,130 --> 00:28:51,450
Of course, I’ll follow your instructions.

551
00:28:52,100 --> 00:28:53,390
That sounds like a blessing.

552
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:54,820
What?

553
00:28:54,820 --> 00:28:57,150
I'm going to report domestic violence.

554
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,140
Don't go home again.

555
00:28:59,570 --> 00:29:00,520
Doctor.

556
00:29:00,520 --> 00:29:02,330
What's the point of blocking the bruises on the eye?

557
00:29:02,330 --> 00:29:04,350
Your arms and legs are bruised.

558
00:29:06,650 --> 00:29:09,880
Didn't he throw shit at the hospital last time?

559
00:29:10,970 --> 00:29:13,390
I don't know what else he'll do this time.

560
00:29:14,930 --> 00:29:17,590
-I’m okay... -I’m not.

561
00:29:18,440 --> 00:29:20,400
I have the duty to report.

562
00:29:21,530 --> 00:29:22,900
Go and report it according to the rules.

563
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:24,980
And give Ms. Gim Hyeon-ji the number of the recreation center.

564
00:29:25,540 --> 00:29:26,160
Okay.

565
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:28,430
Just go out from here.

566
00:29:48,800 --> 00:29:50,260
Didn't I tell you to go home and rest?

567
00:29:51,080 --> 00:29:53,090
Why go to work now like this?

568
00:29:56,380 --> 00:30:00,600
I don't understand the act of disappearing after a breakup.

569
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:02,760
People should be responsible, right?

570
00:30:04,390 --> 00:30:05,270
You...

571
00:30:05,910 --> 00:30:09,550
Did you really break up? Really?

572
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:14,630
I don't know.

573
00:30:15,550 --> 00:30:17,970
I proposed to break up many times.

574
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,800
Why did he get so angry?

575
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:21,820
So why didn't you treat him better when you were together?

576
00:30:21,820 --> 00:30:24,640
I told it when you often proposed to break up.

577
00:30:31,490 --> 00:30:32,730
Why are you still in uniform?

578
00:30:33,700 --> 00:30:38,370
Well, the schedule is too full, so I can't go on a trip.

579
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:41,760
You're always like this.

580
00:30:42,420 --> 00:30:44,840
I'm always in the back of the line, right? Am I the only one in a hurry?

581
00:30:44,840 --> 00:30:48,090
It's a very urgent patient. I have to save lives.

582
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,510
Fine.

583
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:51,470
You have to save the patient.

584
00:30:53,030 --> 00:30:55,150
But let's break up.

585
00:30:55,850 --> 00:30:57,430
Jeong-won, what's wrong now?

586
00:30:59,300 --> 00:31:01,710
Jeong-won, it's really urgent. I...

587
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,640
I heard that this roast pork is very good.

588
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:09,510
Let's try it.

589
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,990
-Jeong-won. -What's wrong?

590
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,790
It has no smell of meat.

591
00:31:16,020 --> 00:31:17,140
I told you,

592
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:20,000
I saw a pig slaughter when I was a kid and fainted.

593
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:23,460
So as long as it's pork, I can't smell and even look at it.

594
00:31:24,180 --> 00:31:25,330
Let's order something else.

595
00:31:27,580 --> 00:31:30,670
You know how much I like pork, right?

596
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:32,140
Yes.

597
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,980
You can't even stand that for me?

598
00:31:34,530 --> 00:31:36,910
Forget it. Don't eat it. Don't eat.

599
00:31:40,580 --> 00:31:41,530
Let's break up.

600
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:45,890
How could he leave you to love Han Gye-jeol?

601
00:31:46,280 --> 00:31:47,860
Is Professor Do crazy?

602
00:31:48,390 --> 00:31:49,720
You think he's strange too, right?

603
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,800
Very strange, not normal at all.

604
00:31:53,650 --> 00:31:55,190
He's really weird now.

605
00:32:00,160 --> 00:32:01,340
(Raw steaky pork)

606
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:03,840
That place sells pork.

607
00:32:04,870 --> 00:32:05,710
So?

608
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:08,400
He doesn't like pork.

609
00:32:09,030 --> 00:32:11,610
He has an abnormal fear of pork and can't even smell it or look at it.

610
00:32:12,670 --> 00:32:14,200
But he stayed there for such a long time.

611
00:32:14,900 --> 00:32:15,880
Does that make sense?

612
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,680
Are you sure that Professor Do actually got his memory back?

613
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:24,630
Jeong-won, have you been cheated?

614
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:49,620
Delicious?

615
00:32:49,620 --> 00:32:52,270
Didn't I tell you to keep your voice down when you eat?

616
00:32:53,330 --> 00:32:55,270
I'm sorry.

617
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:57,050
What are you sorry for?

618
00:32:57,050 --> 00:32:58,810
For not mix the water to make the rice properly?

619
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:00,620
Or for frying the bean sprouts to no taste?

620
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,880
Or

621
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:04,250
the thing that you look ugly?

622
00:33:04,250 --> 00:33:06,230
You...

623
00:33:06,230 --> 00:33:08,340
Don’t you put your mouth back?

624
00:33:08,340 --> 00:33:09,510
Are you being rebellious?

625
00:33:09,510 --> 00:33:10,530
Why don't you eat?

626
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:12,420
Eat like you just did!

627
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:14,940
How can I eat with this mouth?

628
00:33:14,940 --> 00:33:17,120
Why don't I poke a big hole in your face?

629
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,960
That will definitely make you eat well.

630
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:21,260
By the way, that...

631
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:22,220
Lord Deity, Lord Deity,

632
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:22,920
I...

633
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:24,030
I got that suit.

634
00:33:24,030 --> 00:33:26,250
The one called Margiela or Dead.

635
00:33:26,250 --> 00:33:29,150
The limited edition designed by that person.

636
00:33:29,150 --> 00:33:30,640
I got that suit.

637
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:33,360
Wear that when go to work tomorrow,

638
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:36,170
Han Gye-jeol will keep her eyes on you.

639
00:33:36,170 --> 00:33:37,390
What?

640
00:33:37,390 --> 00:33:38,740
Work?

641
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,510
What's wrong?

642
00:33:39,510 --> 00:33:41,250
I can't go to work until I have a seat.

643
00:33:41,250 --> 00:33:42,490
Han Gye-jeol has her own table.

644
00:33:42,490 --> 00:33:43,990
Gak Shin also has a registration desk.

645
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,860
Even that Do Jin-woo has his own place on the flyer.

646
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,210
I'm the only one without a place.

647
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:52,710
Just make a place in the hospital.

648
00:33:52,710 --> 00:33:53,680
What place?

649
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:55,740
For example, general affairs.

650
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:57,580
No, you are not good at arithmetic.

651
00:33:57,580 --> 00:33:58,400
Designer.

652
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,970
No, you're not good at it.

653
00:33:59,970 --> 00:34:00,830
How about a consultant?

654
00:34:00,830 --> 00:34:02,680
Your temper is too bad.

655
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:06,260
Giving Lord Deity a position is too difficult.

656
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,030
What can he do?

657
00:34:08,030 --> 00:34:09,460
Oh, he's...

658
00:34:09,460 --> 00:34:12,739
What can I do?

659
00:34:12,739 --> 00:34:14,320
I'm full.

660
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:19,159
Hey!

661
00:34:19,159 --> 00:34:21,130
Are you full?

662
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,460
Lord Deity,

663
00:34:33,270 --> 00:34:36,400
Although Ok Shin looks like he's in his 40s,

664
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:38,690
the age of his blood vessels is already over 1,400 years old.

665
00:34:38,690 --> 00:34:39,690
If he continues like this, his blood vessels will rupture.

666
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:42,130
Put him down first and educate him then.

667
00:34:42,130 --> 00:34:43,790
A broken blood vessel won't kill him.

668
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:45,429
His face is red, which looks young and that’s good.

669
00:34:45,429 --> 00:34:47,440
He’s going to have a child's face.

670
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,600
Gak Shin, don't have to do that.

671
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:50,500
I'm already dying.

672
00:34:50,500 --> 00:34:51,460
Go ahead.

673
00:34:51,460 --> 00:34:53,540
Noisy!

674
00:34:55,210 --> 00:34:56,469
Lord Deity,

675
00:34:56,469 --> 00:34:59,090
there's a place for you.

676
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:00,630
I know it.

677
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:03,110
My place?

678
00:35:03,110 --> 00:35:04,310
Where?

679
00:35:04,310 --> 00:35:07,250
Put him down first....

680
00:35:07,250 --> 00:35:09,840
Do not want to put him down.

681
00:35:21,760 --> 00:35:23,130
Lord Deity,

682
00:35:23,130 --> 00:35:29,890
Tae Jeong-won robbed Han Gye-jeol's boyfriend before.

683
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:31,130
Tae Jeong-won?

684
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:32,840
Robbed boyfriend?

685
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,150
It’s cheating, cheating!

686
00:35:36,150 --> 00:35:39,650
I'm really sick of cheating!

687
00:35:39,650 --> 00:35:41,920
Why did God create two legs for human beings?

688
00:35:41,920 --> 00:35:43,870
If we only have one leg, we can't cheat, right?

689
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,420
I once asked the priest about it after drinking.

690
00:35:48,870 --> 00:35:49,650
Such an uncultured guy.

691
00:35:49,650 --> 00:35:52,010
The first time I saw her, something was wrong.

692
00:35:52,010 --> 00:35:53,710
It is said that face is scientific,

693
00:35:53,710 --> 00:35:55,250
that is very reasonable.

694
00:35:55,250 --> 00:35:58,840
But you got rid of Tae Jeong-won in one go,

695
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,150
Han Gye-jeol may be very happy.

696
00:36:01,150 --> 00:36:04,080
So in Han Gye-jeol’s mind,

697
00:36:04,080 --> 00:36:09,520
you are the one who helped her revenge.

698
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,300
But why is that my place?

699
00:36:11,300 --> 00:36:12,970
After all, it was Do Jin-woo who helped her revenge.

700
00:36:12,970 --> 00:36:14,710
No, no, no.

701
00:36:14,710 --> 00:36:16,370
The real Do Jin-woo can't do it.

702
00:36:16,370 --> 00:36:17,350
Why?

703
00:36:17,350 --> 00:36:20,530
There's no reason for him to abandon Tae Jeong-won and choose Han Gye-jeol.

704
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,820
This thing can only

705
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:26,010
be done by Lord Deity who pretend to be Do Jin-woo.

706
00:36:26,010 --> 00:36:28,120
Really?

707
00:36:30,490 --> 00:36:32,460
Brilliant!

708
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:33,970
Good Gak Shin!

709
00:36:33,970 --> 00:36:36,570
Why do you start to be excited as soon as you are down?

710
00:36:36,570 --> 00:36:38,690
Gak Shin means that

711
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,030
you can pretend to be Do Jin-woo and confess your love to Han Gye-jeol.

712
00:36:42,030 --> 00:36:45,310
Even if she doesn't want to lose to Tae Jeong-won, Han Gye-jeol will say yes right away.

713
00:36:45,310 --> 00:36:47,200
Han Gye-jeol will successfully revenge.

714
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:49,580
Lord Deity, you can also be liberated.

715
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,930
Brilliant! You’re really the God of Rumors.

716
00:36:54,480 --> 00:36:57,680
Yes.

717
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,310
Whether it's for me or her,

718
00:37:00,310 --> 00:37:03,750
it's a good opportunity to pretend to be Do Jin-woo.

719
00:37:14,210 --> 00:37:15,850
Nurse Bok-gyeong.

720
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:19,450
Hurry up.

721
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,520
Come on.

722
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:22,480
Hurry up.

723
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:27,690
Please bring it to my place.

724
00:37:27,690 --> 00:37:29,110
Nurse Seo.

725
00:37:29,110 --> 00:37:30,350
My place.

726
00:37:35,550 --> 00:37:36,690
Please, Nurse Seo.

727
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:38,620
(Chief of Planning Office, Do Jin-woo)
Please, Nurse Seo.

728
00:37:38,620 --> 00:37:41,590
(Feiyun Clinic)

729
00:37:44,690 --> 00:37:46,210
(Deity)

730
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:46,510
You’ve really got a place.
(Deity)

731
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:49,070
You’ve really got a place.

732
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:50,680
Gak Shin, you’re right.

733
00:37:50,680 --> 00:37:53,340
As soon as I pretended to be Do Jin-woo, Han Gye-jeol made room for me.

734
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,810
It looks like it was moved from the recycling center.

735
00:37:57,810 --> 00:37:59,580
Are you happy with that?

736
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:02,200
I finally know why there's such a thing as status creates people.

737
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,320
Sitting in my own seat, I feel full.

738
00:38:05,320 --> 00:38:07,320
Naturally, I have a great spirit.

739
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:09,460
It seems that the people who take the status as authority,

740
00:38:09,460 --> 00:38:11,640
are really the worst guys.

741
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,110
I will call them together to teach them a great lesson.

742
00:38:16,930 --> 00:38:18,400
I also wrote my name.

743
00:38:19,160 --> 00:38:22,670
(Deity)

744
00:38:22,670 --> 00:38:23,290
Oh my God!
(Deity)

745
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:24,790
Oh my God!

746
00:38:27,090 --> 00:38:28,660
I'm getting more and more disappointed.

747
00:38:28,660 --> 00:38:30,470
Put it on the table too.

748
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:31,640
(Deity)
Put it on the table too.

749
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,070
(Deity)

750
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:45,000
I'll make more money and buy you a better one.

751
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,740
What’s wrong with my place?

752
00:38:46,740 --> 00:38:48,110
I like it very much.

753
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:49,540
It’s very fashion.

754
00:38:49,540 --> 00:38:50,390
Is this

755
00:38:50,390 --> 00:38:51,720
fashion?

756
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,230
Yes.

757
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:55,680
Where... where is the fashion?

758
00:38:55,680 --> 00:38:58,000
The natural scratches here.

759
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,870
And here.

760
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:02,880
It looks very elegant and noble.

761
00:39:08,110 --> 00:39:10,040
Jin-woo, talk with me for a minute.

762
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:12,370
I don't have anything to say.

763
00:39:12,370 --> 00:39:14,390
We have a lot to talk about, Jin-woo.

764
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:17,070
Didn't you hear that I have nothing to say?

765
00:39:17,070 --> 00:39:21,200
If you don't have a good eye, you should at least have a good ear.

766
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:23,020
Can you speak more gently?

767
00:39:23,020 --> 00:39:24,130
How to be gentle?

768
00:39:24,130 --> 00:39:25,910
Talking with a heater?

769
00:39:25,910 --> 00:39:26,890
Jin-woo.

770
00:39:26,890 --> 00:39:29,130
You haven't left yet?

771
00:39:29,130 --> 00:39:30,780
You haven’t got your memory back, right?

772
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:33,770
What?

773
00:39:35,470 --> 00:39:37,390
I can tell by looking at you.

774
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:39,470
You're not the Jin-woo I know.

775
00:39:39,470 --> 00:39:41,380
I've lost my memory.

776
00:39:41,380 --> 00:39:43,870
How would I know that we broke up?

777
00:39:43,870 --> 00:39:45,640
Your diary.

778
00:39:45,640 --> 00:39:48,060
It's a complete record of the Korean Dynasty.

779
00:39:48,060 --> 00:39:50,930
Even the historians didn't write as carefully as you did.

780
00:39:50,930 --> 00:39:53,450
It's all written in the diary, right?

781
00:39:55,580 --> 00:39:57,770
You seduced him

782
00:39:57,770 --> 00:39:59,790
who lost his memory to trick me, right?

783
00:39:59,790 --> 00:40:00,910
Me?

784
00:40:00,910 --> 00:40:01,630
Why?

785
00:40:01,630 --> 00:40:04,800
That's the least you have to do to make us break up.

786
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,780
If you didn't play tricks, you wouldn't be as good as me.

787
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,700
What?

788
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:15,700
Oh, my God, I really...

789
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:19,990
That's why he's been avoiding me.

790
00:40:19,990 --> 00:40:22,870
-He's afraid he'll be exposed. -No.

791
00:40:22,870 --> 00:40:26,070
Professor has recovered his memory. I've confirmed it.

792
00:40:26,070 --> 00:40:27,490
Han Gye-jeol, well...

793
00:40:27,490 --> 00:40:28,660
Really?

794
00:40:28,660 --> 00:40:30,680
Then give me a chance to confirm it.

795
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,650
Confirm?

796
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:37,180
Jin-woo, go on a date with me.

797
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:39,190
I need to spend some time with you to know

798
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:43,180
if your memory back or not?

799
00:40:43,180 --> 00:40:45,020
Why should I do that?

800
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:46,570
Jin-woo,

801
00:40:46,570 --> 00:40:50,580
I also need the time and excuse to break up.

802
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,470
We've been dating for so long, can’t you even do that?

803
00:40:59,060 --> 00:41:01,360
If your memory has really come back,

804
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,720
and you still don’t want to accept me,

805
00:41:02,720 --> 00:41:04,850
I'll let go of you completely then.

806
00:41:06,180 --> 00:41:07,720
Okay.

807
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:11,030
But if

808
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:14,940
Professor's memory is really restored,

809
00:41:16,370 --> 00:41:17,520
apologize to me.

810
00:41:20,210 --> 00:41:21,710
Apologize for what?

811
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:25,840
For hurting me as a former friend,

812
00:41:25,840 --> 00:41:27,180
for slandering me as a liar,

813
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:28,790
and for despising me all along.

814
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,080
Apologize for all of these.

815
00:41:41,090 --> 00:41:42,440
Oh no!

816
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:44,140
I really wonder!

817
00:41:44,140 --> 00:41:46,570
She said she'd help you break the curse of a thousand years,

818
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,460
can’t you even help her with revenge?

819
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:51,730
Just promise her and let her confirm.

820
00:41:51,730 --> 00:41:53,010
You idiot!

821
00:41:53,010 --> 00:41:55,450
What is your brain for?

822
00:41:55,450 --> 00:41:57,750
I t can’t be used for decoration anyway, so just take it off.

823
00:41:57,750 --> 00:41:58,970
To help you take some weight off.

824
00:41:58,970 --> 00:42:01,970
I don't think I said anything wrong.

825
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:04,670
Tae Jeong-won is different from Han Gye-jeol.

826
00:42:04,670 --> 00:42:07,450
Because she knows the real Do Jin-woo,

827
00:42:07,450 --> 00:42:11,100
his interests, habits, and even his body odor.

828
00:42:11,100 --> 00:42:13,480
How can she be fooled?

829
00:42:13,480 --> 00:42:14,970
You’re right.

830
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:17,290
If the lie is exposed,

831
00:42:17,290 --> 00:42:19,270
Han Gye-jeol, who has been following his words, will lose face.

832
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,620
Will she let it go?

833
00:42:20,620 --> 00:42:22,000
She won't just be angry.

834
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,240
What if she hates him

835
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:25,490
and screams at him to disappear?

836
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:26,560
Oh my god!

837
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:27,740
So what should I do?

838
00:42:27,740 --> 00:42:29,490
Should I just run away?

839
00:42:29,490 --> 00:42:30,420
Yes.

840
00:42:30,420 --> 00:42:32,210
Give up this life

841
00:42:32,210 --> 00:42:34,560
and spend the rest of your life happily with us in this world.

842
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:35,970
The next chance will come.

843
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,550
-No. -Why?

844
00:42:37,550 --> 00:42:40,870
The thought of spending a day like a year

845
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:43,950
is already suffocating.

846
00:42:43,950 --> 00:42:46,930
The thought of riding the seesaw of hope and despair again

847
00:42:46,930 --> 00:42:49,090
is already sickening.

848
00:42:54,080 --> 00:42:56,110
At least do something.

849
00:42:56,110 --> 00:42:59,040
What will be worse than going to the underworld?

850
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:02,280
Here, I've brought all of them for each year.

851
00:43:02,280 --> 00:43:05,400
These are Do Jin-woo's diaries.

852
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,140
Until you've memorized all these,

853
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:09,390
don't go to sleep.

854
00:43:12,530 --> 00:43:15,030
Gak Shin, why are there so many words?

855
00:43:15,030 --> 00:43:18,340
How can I memorize all these? So many words.

856
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:20,290
Aigoo, my back, my back.

857
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:21,180
Thank you for your hard work.

858
00:43:21,180 --> 00:43:21,400
(Jang Mi-sun)
Thank you for your hard work.

859
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:22,390
(Jang Mi-sun)

860
00:43:22,390 --> 00:43:24,420
Lord Deity, this is Do Jin-woo's basic resume.

861
00:43:24,420 --> 00:43:27,910
Read this first.

862
00:43:27,910 --> 00:43:29,330
I can do it.

863
00:43:29,330 --> 00:43:30,750
I'm smart.

864
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:32,850
Rhodes Scholar.

865
00:43:32,850 --> 00:43:35,120
Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Rogers Award and Most Outstanding Graduate.

866
00:43:35,120 --> 00:43:37,790
Successfully performed the world's first abdominal liver transplant.

867
00:43:37,790 --> 00:43:38,620
What is the abdominal cavity?

868
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:39,360
(Professor Do Jin-woo, who successfully performed the world’s first laparoscope liver transplant, was promoted to be the youngest Chief of Planning Office of the hospital in the history of Pilseong Hospital.)

871

Youngest Chief of Planning Office in the history of the Pilseong Hospital.

872
00:43:49,780 --> 00:43:51,820
What a great man.

873
00:43:52,730 --> 00:43:55,600
What's the use of that? He's got amnesia.

874
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,730
Why does sister know this kind of person?

875
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,300
Which sister?

876
00:44:01,300 --> 00:44:03,910
No, there is such a person.

877
00:44:05,930 --> 00:44:07,400
She's the one you like, right?

878
00:44:07,400 --> 00:44:08,650
Who is she?

879
00:44:08,650 --> 00:44:10,510
I said no.

880
00:44:13,460 --> 00:44:16,360
Brother,

881
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:19,440
do you know Professor Do Jin-woo?

882
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:21,160
How did you know him?

883
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,550
How did you know him?

884
00:44:25,620 --> 00:44:28,620
Do...Where is Do Jin-woo?

885
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:31,880
Is Do Jin-woo the doctor you're looking for?

886
00:44:31,880 --> 00:44:33,310
The one who knows the list?

887
00:44:33,310 --> 00:44:35,110
Yes.

888
00:44:35,110 --> 00:44:36,540
Where is Do Jin-woo?

889
00:44:36,540 --> 00:44:39,380
Brother, calm down.

890
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:42,000
Is this person trustworthy?

891
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,320
Yes.

892
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:45,650
Even for the Jang Mi-sun accident,

893
00:44:45,650 --> 00:44:47,920
He wouldn’t pretend not to know.

894
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:49,810
Jang Mi-sun.

895
00:44:49,810 --> 00:44:53,220
May I have your name, please?

896
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:56,400
Jang Mi-sun.

897
00:44:56,400 --> 00:45:01,520
The name Jang Mi-sun on the list?

898
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:04,620
How do you know Jang Mi-sun?

899
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:07,300
No, I just saw your list.

900
00:45:07,300 --> 00:45:10,060
That’s how I knew the name.

901
00:45:11,690 --> 00:45:13,960
You have to forget.

902
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:17,220
You don’t know anything. OK?

903
00:45:17,220 --> 00:45:18,820
So...

904
00:45:18,820 --> 00:45:21,450
Where is Do Jin-woo now?

905
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:27,000
Before seeing him,

906
00:45:27,000 --> 00:45:29,210
you need to know this thing first.

907
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:33,100
That person...

908
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:35,530
Had lost his memory.

909
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:37,600
What?

910
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:40,640
Lost memory?

911
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:46,130
Come on, cheer up! Next.

912
00:45:46,130 --> 00:45:47,340
Next!

913
00:45:47,340 --> 00:45:49,380
Next!

914
00:45:52,380 --> 00:45:53,940
Lord Deity,

915
00:45:53,940 --> 00:45:56,250
answer one more time.

916
00:45:56,250 --> 00:45:58,980
Do Jin-woo’s major is?

917
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:00,250
It seems to be Ball-pato...

918
00:46:00,250 --> 00:46:02,440
Well...

919
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:04,180
Hepatopancreatobiliary Surgery.

920
00:46:04,180 --> 00:46:05,010
Hepatopancreatobiliary.

921
00:46:05,010 --> 00:46:07,780
Hepato, Pancreato, Bibilary!

922
00:46:10,860 --> 00:46:13,190
You were up all-night memorizing.

923
00:46:13,190 --> 00:46:16,270
Name, Do Jin-woo. Gender, Male. The next question is this...

924
00:46:16,270 --> 00:46:18,560
No, and the age is 36 years old.

925
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:20,460
35 years old!

926
00:46:25,650 --> 00:46:28,070
What are we having today?

927
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,020
I haven’t had fried rice cake for a long time.

928
00:46:30,020 --> 00:46:32,750
Fried rice cake...

929
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:34,800
Jeong-won,

930
00:46:35,380 --> 00:46:40,340
you know, I grew up in America, so I can’t eat spicy food.

931
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,720
I don’t like the taste of rice cakes, either.

932
00:46:41,720 --> 00:46:46,190
Really? Maybe I haven’t seen you for so long, so I forgot.

933
00:46:46,650 --> 00:46:47,360
Sorry.

934
00:46:47,990 --> 00:46:48,670
Well.

935
00:46:48,670 --> 00:46:50,710
He must have got all the contents ready.

936
00:46:52,310 --> 00:46:53,830
Do you remember that guy?

937
00:46:53,830 --> 00:46:54,580
Who?

938
00:46:54,950 --> 00:46:56,800
When I studied in the US,

939
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,090
I met a guy with only one side of his face sweating.

940
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,720
It was funny at the time.

941
00:47:02,170 --> 00:47:03,880
You mean the guy with Horner syndrome?

942
00:47:04,500 --> 00:47:05,180
What?

943
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:06,950
Right.

944
00:47:08,440 --> 00:47:09,520
He didn’t rise to the bait.

945
00:47:10,460 --> 00:47:11,440
How?

946
00:47:12,140 --> 00:47:16,170
Yes. Do Jin-woo’s diary is a memoir.

947
00:47:25,060 --> 00:47:26,540
Let’s eat pork belly here.

948
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:28,350
You know I really love pork belly.

949
00:47:29,320 --> 00:47:30,210
(The Dragon King’s steaky pork)

950
00:47:30,210 --> 00:47:31,180
-Jeong-won. -Yeah.
(The Dragon King’s steaky pork)

951
00:47:31,180 --> 00:47:32,010
-Jeong-won. -Yeah.

952
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:34,160
I told you I don’t like pork.

953
00:47:34,910 --> 00:47:36,040
Don’t you remember?

954
00:47:37,510 --> 00:47:38,520
Oh, did you say that?

955
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,930
But weren’t you here last time?

956
00:47:41,940 --> 00:47:42,980
And it’s okay at that time.

957
00:47:42,980 --> 00:47:45,580
I was here because I had to work.

958
00:47:46,030 --> 00:47:47,450
Also, I got sick when I got home.

959
00:47:48,670 --> 00:47:49,770
Sick then?

960
00:47:51,830 --> 00:47:54,170
I told you when I was a kid, I saw the killing of pigs.

961
00:47:54,570 --> 00:47:56,810
Psychological consequences won’t be removed so easily.

962
00:47:59,240 --> 00:48:02,540
Have you really remembered all this?

963
00:48:04,980 --> 00:48:06,420
So, we...

964
00:48:06,420 --> 00:48:08,910
Oh, my God! What’ wrong with her?

965
00:48:11,730 --> 00:48:12,270
Are you all right?

966
00:48:12,660 --> 00:48:13,720
Wait, baby.

967
00:48:13,720 --> 00:48:15,800
A patient. Damn!

968
00:48:16,210 --> 00:48:19,120
Once you see the patient, just run.

969
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:20,210
Understand?

970
00:48:23,850 --> 00:48:24,790
Please call an ambulance.

971
00:48:31,850 --> 00:48:34,560
Can you come and enquire when I’m checking her pulse.

972
00:48:36,470 --> 00:48:38,230
The ambulance will arrive soon.

973
00:48:39,760 --> 00:48:40,420
What are you doing?

974
00:48:41,050 --> 00:48:43,600
Don’t you remember any of this?

975
00:48:48,720 --> 00:48:50,140
May I ask you, this patient?

976
00:48:51,820 --> 00:48:53,810
What’s wrong with you now?

977
00:48:55,610 --> 00:48:56,330
Bellyache.

978
00:48:57,810 --> 00:48:58,890
This is gonna kill the patient.

979
00:49:00,550 --> 00:49:02,360
If you don’t remember, I’ll deal with it.

980
00:49:07,650 --> 00:49:09,380
Do you have back or lower back pain?

No, just bellyache.

No pain in the lumbar, so that’s not supposed to be labor pain.

Do you mean me? Hello?

1142
00:58:02,300 --> 00:58:04,100
How do I look like his dad?

1143
00:58:04,100 --> 00:58:05,980
What’s the matter?

1144
00:58:07,870 --> 00:58:10,070
Oh, damn!

1145
00:58:11,590 --> 00:58:13,980
Hello, little kid.

1146
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:15,480
Where is your real dad?

1147
00:58:15,480 --> 00:58:16,780
He went to work.

1148
00:58:18,390 --> 00:58:19,430
Professor Do!

1149
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,830
How could you just hang up the phone like that? I told you I had something to ask you.

1150
00:58:25,080 --> 00:58:27,160
Smell of sweat.

1151
00:58:27,160 --> 00:58:29,400
Gee, you’re such a...

1152
00:58:29,400 --> 00:58:31,950
Sorry, because I was in a hurry.

1153
00:58:34,190 --> 00:58:35,600
But who are you?

1154
00:58:35,600 --> 00:58:36,840
I am Hui-dong.

1155
00:58:36,840 --> 00:58:38,750
Go Hui-dong.

1156
00:58:40,200 --> 00:58:42,410
I think you can tell it’s not mine.

1157
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:43,330
He’s the patient’s child.

1158
00:58:45,220 --> 00:58:46,290
Did someone say something?

1159
00:58:47,980 --> 00:58:49,940
Do you remember Bak Chung-seong?

1160
00:58:49,940 --> 00:58:52,150
Well, scammer.

1161
00:58:52,150 --> 00:58:54,080
You said you’ve regained your memory.

1162
00:58:54,080 --> 00:58:56,920
And you could treat patients. But don’t you remember Bak Chung-seong?

1163
00:58:58,810 --> 00:59:01,590
Ah... Bak Chung-seong.

1164
00:59:01,590 --> 00:59:02,930
-Bak Chung-seong. -Bak Chung-seong.

1165
00:59:02,930 --> 00:59:04,510
Bak Chung-seong. Hurry up!

1166
00:59:04,510 --> 00:59:07,720
Bak Chung-seong. Hurry, hurry! Bak Chung-seong.

1167
00:59:07,720 --> 00:59:08,970
President, there’s nothing with Bak Chung-seong.

1168
00:59:08,970 --> 00:59:10,500
How could it be? Check again!

1169
00:59:10,500 --> 00:59:13,120
Please just buy some time and I’ll get it right back.

1170
00:59:13,120 --> 00:59:16,140
I hear you got some kind of list from Bak Chung-seong.

1171
00:59:16,140 --> 00:59:17,890
-What is it? -The list.

The child is here. Stop talking something like that.

1174
00:59:26,420 --> 00:59:27,210
We’ll talk about it later.

1175
00:59:28,970 --> 00:59:30,670
I’m hungry.

1176
00:59:30,670 --> 00:59:32,270
Dad.

1177
00:59:32,270 --> 00:59:34,140
Well, we can’t starve ourselves.

1178
00:59:34,140 --> 00:59:35,460
We won’t starve our Hui-dong.

1179
00:59:35,460 --> 00:59:36,810
Let’s eat something delicious.

1180
00:59:36,810 --> 00:59:39,430
Count me in. I’m hungry too.

Hey, are you Tae Jeong-won?

1184

Did you call the police to arrest me?

Domestic violence?

1187
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:59,340
I can deal with my wife at my will.

Why did you mean to stickybeak?

1189
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,300
That’s not me.

1190
01:00:04,300 --> 01:00:06,360
Let go firstly.

1191
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:10,340
Ah... Bring me the woman who called the police.

1192
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:12,100
-Who called the police? -Get out, please.

1193
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:14,620
-Get out. -Let go. Let me go.

1194
01:00:14,620 --> 01:00:15,790
Let go. Let me go!

1195
01:00:15,790 --> 01:00:18,820
Okay, okay. Let me go!

1196
01:00:18,820 --> 01:00:22,550
My wife ran away because of you.

1197
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,960
Get my wife back!

1198
01:00:30,150 --> 01:00:33,540
Well... Did your date go well?

1199
01:00:33,540 --> 01:00:36,620
What date? It is the test going well.

1200
01:00:36,620 --> 01:00:40,380
Don’t you feel re-attracted by her after seeing her?

1201
01:00:40,380 --> 01:00:43,720
Why did you want to inquiry others’ life?

1202
01:00:43,720 --> 01:00:45,660
This is what people usually call…

1203
01:00:45,660 --> 01:00:46,960
Fried chicken...

1204
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:49,980
Your dad bought for you. Help yourself.

1205
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:51,750
I’m digging in.

1206
01:00:51,750 --> 01:00:53,540
If I were somebody’s dad at the present,

1207
01:00:53,540 --> 01:00:55,740
the kid must be born when I was 10.

1208
01:00:55,740 --> 01:00:59,070
-Wait. -What?

1209
01:00:59,070 --> 01:01:00,390
The chicken is strange.

1210
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,550
Is it genetically modified or something? Something like that.

1211
01:01:05,990 --> 01:01:07,470
Yummy!

1212
01:01:07,470 --> 01:01:09,120
Why are there only ten drumsticks?

1213
01:01:09,120 --> 01:01:10,390
No wings, and no body.

1214
01:01:10,390 --> 01:01:11,150
There are only ten drumsticks.

1215
01:01:11,150 --> 01:01:12,440
There are no birds like that.

1216
01:01:12,440 --> 01:01:14,360
Because I only ordered the drumsticks.

1217
01:01:14,360 --> 01:01:16,620
For fried chicken, drumsticks are the best.

1218
01:01:16,620 --> 01:01:19,840
What? For fried chicken, chicken breasts are the best.

1219
01:01:19,840 --> 01:01:22,910
No one’s gonna eat that kind of dried-up meat.

1220
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,340
-What a mismatch! –What a mismatch!

1221
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:30,450
It’s a perfect match!

1222
01:01:32,020 --> 01:01:32,640
What?

1223
01:01:32,640 --> 01:01:35,050
You won’t fight when you eat fried chicken.

1224
01:01:35,050 --> 01:01:37,110
So are my mom and dad .

1225
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:40,170
They say this is a perfect match.

1226
01:01:42,430 --> 01:01:43,450
Really?

1227
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:47,440
Unexpectedly.

1228
01:01:52,490 --> 01:01:53,550
Dad!

1229
01:01:57,330 --> 01:02:00,290
Are you Hui-dong’s dad? What a hard period for me.

1230
01:02:03,890 --> 01:02:08,230
Honey, they said they wanted to say hi to you.

1231
01:02:12,660 --> 01:02:14,490

Patient, are you OK?

1234
01:02:23,180 --> 01:02:25,410
Get the magnesium and nitrophenyridine.

1235
01:02:25,410 --> 01:02:26,570
Hurry up!

1236
01:02:26,570 --> 01:02:27,930
Okay.

1237
01:02:27,930 --> 01:02:29,740
Patient, patient,

1238
01:02:29,740 --> 01:02:30,640
can you hear me?

1239
01:02:30,640 --> 01:02:33,030
Patient, can you hear me?

1240
01:02:37,960 --> 01:02:38,780
Are you okay?

1241
01:02:39,960 --> 01:02:42,800
Patient, cheer up!

1242
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:43,880
What’s going on?

1243
01:02:43,880 --> 01:02:44,730
Who are you please?

1244
01:02:53,600 --> 01:02:56,540
I am Han Gye-jeol, chief physician of emergency medicine center of Seoul Pilseong Hospital.

1245
01:02:56,540 --> 01:02:58,150
You must be an intern.

1246
01:02:58,150 --> 01:02:59,250
Is the staff absent?

1247
01:03:00,260 --> 01:03:02,500
There was an accident so they were off duty.

1248
01:03:04,170 --> 01:03:04,680
It seems to be eclampsia.

1249

(Eclampsia (Eclampsia)
Hypertensive disorder of pregnancy with seizures)
It seems to be eclampsia.

The convulsions have stopped but the mother’s blood pressure is uncontrollable.

1252
01:03:09,970 --> 01:03:11,350
Call the obstetrician on duty.

1253
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,520
Tell them the patient needs a C-section at once.

Set up an operating room.

1255
01:03:13,570 --> 01:03:15,030
-I got it! -Okay.

1256
01:03:17,170 --> 01:03:18,850
What happened?

1257
01:03:18,850 --> 01:03:20,300
This is eclampsia.

1258
01:03:20,300 --> 01:03:22,670
It’s urgent and she needs a C-section right now.

(Emergency Ward)
It’s urgent and she needs a C-section right now.

1260
01:03:23,560 --> 01:03:25,590
Just do the surgery and she’ll be fine?

1261

Don’t worry, Hui-dong.

I’m sure these doctors will cure your mother.

Really?

1271
01:03:59,010 --> 01:04:00,050

What?

01:04:33,070 --> 01:04:35,890
I’m taking the patient to the O.R. firstly.

1284

You go to the OB and get the doctor.

It’s not my style.

01:05:44,060 --> 01:05:46,690
There’s a risk of oxygen tanks exploding.

1305
01:05:46,690 --> 01:05:49,260
-Please get out of the hospital immediately. -What?

1306
01:05:51,020 --> 01:05:52,550
Emergency!

1307
01:05:52,550 --> 01:05:54,840
A fire in the emergency room!

1308
01:05:54,840 --> 01:05:55,200
There’s a risk of oxygen tanks exploding.

1309
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:57,170
(Central Operating Room)
There’s a risk of oxygen tanks exploding.

1310
01:05:57,350 --> 01:05:59,710
-Please get out of the hospital immediately.

1311
01:05:59,710 --> 01:06:01,280
It seems like a big fire.

1312
01:06:03,050 --> 01:06:05,020
What are you doing? Just run away!

1313
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:07,540
If we all leave, the patient and the baby will die.

1314
01:06:08,690 --> 01:06:10,500
And please be prepared.

1315
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:12,460
-For what? -For the surgery.

1316
01:06:12,460 --> 01:06:14,310
Since you can do a laparoscopic liver transplant,

1317
01:06:14,310 --> 01:06:16,270
I think you can also do a C-section.

1318
01:06:16,270 --> 01:06:17,610
I’ll assist you?

1319
01:06:18,750 --> 01:06:21,580
I... I... I can’t do it.

1320
01:06:21,580 --> 01:06:23,350
Professor!

1321
01:06:23,350 --> 01:06:26,290
If you don’t operate, the patient and the baby will die.

1322
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:28,120
Are you going to take Hui-dong’s mother away from him?

1323
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:30,980
This...

1324
01:06:32,650 --> 01:06:34,370
Do you remember Bak Chung-seong?

1325
01:06:34,370 --> 01:06:36,480
Well, scammer.

1326
01:06:36,480 --> 01:06:38,400
You said you’ve regained your memory.

1327
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:41,290
And you could treat patients. But don’t you remember Bak Chung-seong?

1328
01:06:44,350 --> 01:06:46,820
-Professor. -What?

1329
01:06:48,080 --> 01:06:49,920
You don’t remember Bak Chung-seong. Right?

1330
01:06:52,310 --> 01:06:54,560
You don’t even know what that list is, do you?

1331

(Access Restricted Area)

1332
01:06:56,740 --> 01:06:58,720
You can remember nothing?
(Access Restricted Area)

1333
01:06:58,720 --> 01:06:59,600
You can remember nothing?

1334
01:06:59,600 --> 01:07:01,110
You really don’t remember any of this?

1335
01:07:01,110 --> 01:07:03,770
I’m gonna go get the doctor and that’ll be it.

1336
01:07:04,970 --> 01:07:08,230
Where else are you gonna find a doctor after all this?

1337
01:07:08,230 --> 01:07:10,890
Oh, you’re trying to run away again.

1338
01:07:10,890 --> 01:07:11,860
Hey, you…

1339
01:07:11,860 --> 01:07:13,650
In your eyes, I can do nothing but run away?

1340
01:07:13,650 --> 01:07:16,720
Wouldn’t you run away since you were a good liar anyway?

1341
01:07:16,720 --> 01:07:17,780
You really…

1342

(Surgery Center)

1343
01:07:20,130 --> 01:07:20,420
Hey you…where are you going?
(Surgery Center)

1344
01:07:20,420 --> 01:07:21,770
(Central Operating Room)
Hey you…where are you going?

1345
01:07:21,770 --> 01:07:22,500
Hey, where are you going?
(Central Operating Room)

1346
01:07:22,860 --> 01:07:24,180
Hey, Han Gye-jeol.

1347
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:25,440
What the hell are you doing?

1348
01:07:26,690 --> 01:07:27,530
I…

1349
01:07:29,570 --> 01:07:31,790
I’m going to have surgery.

1350
01:07:31,790 --> 01:07:33,520
Is this...

1351
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:35,350
the surgery you can do?

1352
01:07:35,350 --> 01:07:37,230
Have you ever done it?

1353
01:07:37,230 --> 01:07:40,010
I worked as an assistant countless time as an intern.

1354
01:07:40,010 --> 01:07:43,080
You mean you’ve never done it yourself, right?

1355
01:07:45,460 --> 01:07:46,260
Forget it.

1356
01:07:46,260 --> 01:07:47,520
After we get out of here.

1357
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:51,260
Then let the patient die?

1358
01:07:51,260 --> 01:07:54,430
What are you gonna say to her family?

1359
01:07:54,430 --> 01:07:57,300
That she’s dying and we were doing nothing but stand by?

1360
01:07:58,940 --> 01:07:59,580
Hey...

1361
01:08:01,260 --> 01:08:03,080
Professor.

1362
01:08:03,080 --> 01:08:05,990
Please cheer up!

1363
01:08:05,990 --> 01:08:08,250
Don’t you remember anything at all?

1364
01:08:08,250 --> 01:08:11,310
Maybe if you are eager to remember something, you will regain your memory.

1365
01:08:13,320 --> 01:08:16,029
Cheer up, Professor!

1366
01:08:16,029 --> 01:08:17,460
Please!

1367
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:19,660
Please come back!

1368
01:08:19,660 --> 01:08:21,540
Come back, Professor!

1369
01:08:23,200 --> 01:08:24,260
Hey…

1370
01:08:47,130 --> 01:08:48,470
Professor!

1371
01:08:51,729 --> 01:08:52,939
Professor!

1372
01:08:53,979 --> 01:08:55,689
Professor, what’s wrong with you?

1373
01:08:57,990 --> 01:09:02,410
Professor, wake up, please?

1374
01:09:02,410 --> 01:09:03,540
Professor!

1375
01:09:04,760 --> 01:09:07,370
Wake up, Professor!

1376
01:09:07,370 --> 01:09:08,479
Professor!

1377
01:09:24,620 --> 01:09:26,029
Dr. Han...

1378
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,410
Here…where am I?

1379

(Next Episode Preview)

1380
01:10:12,750 --> 01:10:13,200
The king of the road to hades , have you gone home?

1381
01:10:13,200 --> 01:10:15,300
(Thanks to special appearance of Wang Kwang-na and Jeong A-mi.)
The king of the road to hades , have you gone home?

1382
01:10:15,300 --> 01:10:16,380
The king of the road to hades , have you gone home?

1383
01:10:16,380 --> 01:10:17,840
I will definitely be there, Han Gye-jeol.

1384
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,320
Just give me some time.

1385
01:10:19,320 --> 01:10:23,000
Dr. Han won’t visit you again, Deity.

1386
01:10:23,000 --> 01:10:23,860
What?

1387
01:10:23,860 --> 01:10:23,900
Yeah.

1388
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:24,750
(Do Jin-woo, graduated from Johns Hopkins University, Chief of Planning Office, Seoul Pilseong Hospital)
Yeah.

1389
01:10:24,750 --> 01:10:25,210
Yeah.

1390
01:10:25,210 --> 01:10:26,940
He’s the one I’m waiting for.

1391
01:10:26,940 --> 01:10:28,040
Look at this... look at this...

1392
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:30,080
It turned out that he had relationship with Han Gye-jeol.

1393
01:10:30,080 --> 01:10:31,740
Listen to me. Is that true?

1394
01:10:31,740 --> 01:10:34,360
Is there no room for Deity in your heart?

1395
01:10:34,360 --> 01:10:36,460
I’m not sure.

1396
01:10:36,460 --> 01:10:39,810
Do Jin-woo, you are under arrest for the murder of Choe Gwang-mo.

1397
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:42,400
I don’t want to take on all the things that Deity did.
