1
00:00:42,969 --> 00:00:45,779
Being a woman is like a dance.

2
00:00:46,231 --> 00:00:48,823
A movement with natural grace.

3
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:52,135
It flows between strength,

4
00:00:52,335 --> 00:00:54,371
courage, and emotion.

5
00:00:54,997 --> 00:00:57,432
With every sway of the body

6
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:01,294
a deep story of
freedom is expressed.

7
00:01:02,296 --> 00:01:04,006
Because womanhood

8
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:05,925
is not a weakness.

9
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:10,012
It is a strength
that knows restraint.

10
00:01:10,638 --> 00:01:12,765
Knows how to
choose the right time

11
00:01:12,790 --> 00:01:14,141
to ignite.

12
00:01:15,268 --> 00:01:17,060
It is an existence.

13
00:01:17,228 --> 00:01:19,355
The happiness of a soul

14
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,023
that wants to be free.

15
00:01:22,256 --> 00:01:24,277
A form of femininity

16
00:01:24,302 --> 00:01:25,986
that doesn't need

17
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:27,696
to explain itself.

18
00:01:28,621 --> 00:01:30,407
As long as I'm dancing,

19
00:01:31,051 --> 00:01:32,618
moving,

20
00:01:33,492 --> 00:01:35,412
as long as the world turns

21
00:01:35,842 --> 00:01:37,539
I will move with it.

22
00:01:38,344 --> 00:01:39,356
This...

23
00:01:39,944 --> 00:01:41,695
Is my dream.

24
00:06:01,704 --> 00:06:03,163
Do you have tissue?

25
00:06:42,324 --> 00:06:43,394
Get dressed, hurry up.

26
00:07:28,874 --> 00:07:29,994
Esta,

27
00:07:30,100 --> 00:07:31,310
we need this now.

28
00:07:31,335 --> 00:07:32,952
Please.

29
00:07:32,977 --> 00:07:34,004
Okay.

30
00:07:34,004 --> 00:07:35,043
Esta!

31
00:07:35,147 --> 00:07:36,440
I sent an email.

32
00:07:36,465 --> 00:07:37,487
It's the deadline.

33
00:07:37,512 --> 00:07:38,680
I’ve said it over and over.

34
00:07:38,705 --> 00:07:39,718
Yes, sir.

35
00:07:39,743 --> 00:07:41,535
I’ll do it now.
Just a moment.

36
00:07:41,612 --> 00:07:43,155
- Hello?
- Hello, Esta?

37
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:45,366
What’s the status of
our framework project?

38
00:07:45,391 --> 00:07:47,619
I'm working on it
already, ma'am. Sorry.

39
00:07:47,644 --> 00:07:48,671
Huh?

40
00:07:49,485 --> 00:07:50,580
We talked about it last week.

41
00:07:50,604 --> 00:07:52,049
It should be done by now.

42
00:07:53,207 --> 00:07:54,333
Ah, yes.

43
00:07:54,358 --> 00:07:55,572
I’ll do to it now, ma'am.

44
00:07:55,626 --> 00:07:57,044
Sorry for the delay.

45
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:58,814
Alright, alright.

46
00:07:59,294 --> 00:08:00,872
- Bye.
- Bye, thank you.

47
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:24,263
Esta.

48
00:08:25,055 --> 00:08:26,145
Esta!

49
00:08:27,116 --> 00:08:28,292
Bestie!

50
00:08:31,145 --> 00:08:32,188
Hey!

51
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,206
- Hello!
- Hi.

52
00:08:34,231 --> 00:08:36,298
Happy monthsary, lovebirds!

53
00:08:37,419 --> 00:08:39,095
Where’s Alfie?

54
00:08:41,101 --> 00:08:42,112
Did you fight?

55
00:08:43,695 --> 00:08:45,500
He said he still has
something to finish.

56
00:08:46,952 --> 00:08:48,717
So, no celebration?

57
00:08:49,634 --> 00:08:51,697
There are still many
monthsaries ahead.

58
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:52,999
You're unbelievable.

59
00:08:53,142 --> 00:08:55,798
Why did you even
make me come here, bestie?

60
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,021
Nothing, just keep me company.

61
00:08:58,689 --> 00:08:59,732
Oh my God!

62
00:08:59,757 --> 00:09:02,776
Back in college,
I almost charged you rent here.

63
00:09:02,801 --> 00:09:04,794
You had so many sleepovers.

64
00:09:04,819 --> 00:09:06,867
You probably slept
here a million times.

65
00:09:13,047 --> 00:09:14,495
What are you watching?

66
00:09:14,708 --> 00:09:15,870
This?

67
00:09:16,331 --> 00:09:17,682
Pole dancing class.

68
00:09:17,782 --> 00:09:18,919
Look, bestie.

69
00:09:20,069 --> 00:09:21,166
Isn’t it nice?

70
00:09:22,154 --> 00:09:24,156
You know,
from watching this so much,

71
00:09:24,156 --> 00:09:26,174
I kind of want to enroll, too.

72
00:09:27,367 --> 00:09:29,351
But I don’t even
know how to dance.

73
00:09:30,287 --> 00:09:31,638
How about you? Try it.

74
00:09:32,039 --> 00:09:34,307
Weren’t you a dancer
back in college?

75
00:09:36,098 --> 00:09:37,102
Yeah,

76
00:09:37,127 --> 00:09:38,140
back then.

77
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:42,958
Try this. I’m sure this
will be easy for you.

78
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,552
Look.

79
00:09:47,786 --> 00:09:48,963
Fierce!

80
00:09:50,808 --> 00:09:52,103
Serving looks!

81
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,084
I've been receiving complaints
from your clients.

82
00:10:02,861 --> 00:10:04,356
Do I always have to save you?

83
00:10:07,367 --> 00:10:08,524
I'm sorry, babe.

84
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,653
I talked to Mr. Cruz.

85
00:10:17,888 --> 00:10:18,972
Mr. Cruz?

86
00:10:19,239 --> 00:10:20,239
Why?

87
00:10:21,713 --> 00:10:22,749
Well,

88
00:10:23,006 --> 00:10:25,166
I suggested you be transferred
to another team for now.

89
00:10:26,468 --> 00:10:28,194
I think you'd benefit more if

90
00:10:28,545 --> 00:10:31,258
you handled fewer projects first.

91
00:10:31,925 --> 00:10:33,004
Less mistakes.

92
00:10:33,867 --> 00:10:35,077
So I can also work on

93
00:10:35,102 --> 00:10:36,465
your promotion
with the higher-ups.

94
00:10:37,057 --> 00:10:38,318
You're transferring me?

95
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:40,802
Well, it’s not like that.

96
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,938
I mean...

97
00:10:42,173 --> 00:10:43,235
It was just discussed.

98
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:44,470
It’s not final yet, but…

99
00:10:45,821 --> 00:10:47,072
He seemed okay with the idea.

100
00:10:49,556 --> 00:10:50,598
But I wish

101
00:10:50,623 --> 00:10:52,493
you consulted me first.

102
00:10:53,950 --> 00:10:54,970
Can you please

103
00:10:54,995 --> 00:10:56,162
not transfer me just yet?

104
00:10:57,458 --> 00:10:59,927
Let me make decisions
for myself first.

105
00:11:02,329 --> 00:11:03,364
That's right.

106
00:11:03,930 --> 00:11:05,765
Esta is doing her best.

107
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:13,049
Babe,

108
00:11:14,211 --> 00:11:15,971
I just don't want you
to struggle in the end.

109
00:11:17,578 --> 00:11:19,079
This job can secure your future

110
00:11:19,104 --> 00:11:20,492
better than what you're doing.

111
00:11:20,658 --> 00:11:22,416
I can't just sit back while

112
00:11:22,441 --> 00:11:23,984
you ruin your chances

113
00:11:24,009 --> 00:11:25,276
at a better life.

114
00:11:37,643 --> 00:11:39,285
I still have papers
to take care of.

115
00:11:47,639 --> 00:11:49,127
Alfie’s so cranky.

116
00:11:49,607 --> 00:11:50,720
Is it time of the month?

117
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:52,554
Let it go.

118
00:11:52,763 --> 00:11:54,264
He’s probably
stressed from work.

119
00:11:54,264 --> 00:11:55,304
That’s why he's like that.

120
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:57,174
Oh, no!

121
00:11:57,684 --> 00:11:58,936
I’d punch him for that.

122
00:12:01,588 --> 00:12:03,228
Come on, finish that up.

123
00:12:03,482 --> 00:12:04,576
Oh, it’s already finished.

124
00:12:09,826 --> 00:12:11,186
Don’t think about
it anymore, okay?

125
00:12:12,741 --> 00:12:14,893
Come on. I’m used
to that already.

126
00:12:16,107 --> 00:12:17,192
Oh girl!

127
00:12:17,217 --> 00:12:18,481
If it weren’t for Sir Alfie,

128
00:12:18,506 --> 00:12:20,098
she wouldn’t have gotten in here.

129
00:12:20,123 --> 00:12:21,983
As an intern,
I am really good.

130
00:12:22,156 --> 00:12:24,144
Her tasks are super basic, girl!

131
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,413
And now,

132
00:12:26,813 --> 00:12:27,931
she’s getting transferred

133
00:12:27,955 --> 00:12:29,524
- to Team Two.
- Hmm?

134
00:12:29,549 --> 00:12:32,566
Yeah, because she can’t
keep up with our sales.

135
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:33,595
True.

136
00:12:33,595 --> 00:12:34,736
At least there,

137
00:12:34,821 --> 00:12:37,391
- she won’t have any competition, right?
- Exactly!

138
00:12:37,391 --> 00:12:39,268
And she’s always late
with deadlines, right?

139
00:12:39,268 --> 00:12:41,536
- So true.
- Hey! Keep your voice down!

140
00:12:42,175 --> 00:12:43,224
Hey, ma'am!

141
00:12:44,414 --> 00:12:46,166
I told you, you're too loud,

142
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:47,204
ma'am is right there.

143
00:12:48,485 --> 00:12:49,570
Hey, don't be so loud.

144
00:12:50,112 --> 00:12:51,207
Hi, ma'am.

145
00:12:51,232 --> 00:12:53,514
We heard you’re
transferring to team two?

146
00:12:53,715 --> 00:12:55,008
Yes, ma'am.

147
00:12:55,033 --> 00:12:56,468
We’ll miss you.

148
00:12:56,493 --> 00:12:59,443
- We'll miss you.
- Right?

149
00:13:02,291 --> 00:13:04,918
You! If we get
reprimanded, seriously!

150
00:13:20,946 --> 00:13:21,958
Are you drunk?

151
00:13:22,912 --> 00:13:24,266
Did something happen at work?

152
00:13:34,702 --> 00:13:35,723
Not really.

153
00:13:36,973 --> 00:13:38,723
The bosses just
decided to go out.

154
00:13:39,781 --> 00:13:41,873
You know I can’t
say no to that.

155
00:13:54,920 --> 00:13:56,713
Do you want me
to make you happy?

156
00:14:21,768 --> 00:14:22,919
You’re drunk, babe.

157
00:14:23,728 --> 00:14:25,011
Go to sleep. Come on.

158
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:26,889
Lie down.

159
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:39,905
You smell like alcohol, babe!

160
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,121
- It’s okay, babe.
- Stop it.

161
00:18:55,382 --> 00:18:57,489
- Wow!
- You’re amazing, teach!

162
00:18:57,514 --> 00:18:58,514
Yes!

163
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:00,940
How do you do that?

164
00:19:03,151 --> 00:19:05,202
So good.

165
00:19:06,348 --> 00:19:08,274
[clapping, cheering]

166
00:19:09,485 --> 00:19:11,584
- Woohoo!
- Bravo!

167
00:19:11,609 --> 00:19:13,965
[clapping, cheering]

168
00:19:13,990 --> 00:19:15,040
Nice, coach!

169
00:19:17,415 --> 00:19:18,448
Yes?

170
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:36,742
Woo! Good job, coach!

171
00:19:36,767 --> 00:19:39,312
[clapping, cheering]

172
00:19:39,337 --> 00:19:40,337
Nice, coach.

173
00:19:48,942 --> 00:19:49,942
Hi!

174
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:52,451
I saw you earlier.

175
00:19:52,715 --> 00:19:54,333
Were you inquiring at the studio?

176
00:19:54,406 --> 00:19:55,470
Ah, no.

177
00:19:55,503 --> 00:19:56,513
No, no.

178
00:19:56,538 --> 00:19:57,956
I was just curious,

179
00:19:57,981 --> 00:19:59,704
so I dropped by here.

180
00:20:03,798 --> 00:20:04,885
That’s alright.

181
00:20:09,896 --> 00:20:11,235
Do you want to dance?

182
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:15,061
We offer pole dance classes.

183
00:20:19,013 --> 00:20:20,557
I’ll think about it first.

184
00:20:22,358 --> 00:20:23,818
Why? Busy with work?

185
00:20:26,008 --> 00:20:28,460
You know, a lot of
my students are like that.

186
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:31,034
Corporate slaves by day,

187
00:20:31,923 --> 00:20:33,799
but free-spirited
dancers by night.

188
00:20:36,818 --> 00:20:39,111
The studio has a
flexible schedule anyway.

189
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:44,817
It’s just that I’m a bit shy.

190
00:20:44,976 --> 00:20:45,984
Like...

191
00:20:46,689 --> 00:20:47,774
Like, I can't do it.

192
00:20:49,864 --> 00:20:51,844
Why would you say
you can’t do it?

193
00:20:52,077 --> 00:20:53,829
You haven’t even tried yet.

194
00:20:57,425 --> 00:20:59,261
You know, don’t
hold yourself back.

195
00:21:04,209 --> 00:21:06,211
I hope to see you
in one of my classes.

196
00:21:11,605 --> 00:21:13,523
By the way, I’m Athena.

197
00:21:15,033 --> 00:21:16,062
Esta.

198
00:21:18,788 --> 00:21:20,999
Just come by if you’ve
made up your mind.

199
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:24,685
Okay.

200
00:22:16,647 --> 00:22:17,682
Oh?

201
00:22:17,857 --> 00:22:18,864
- You're leaving?
- Yeah, see you.

202
00:22:18,888 --> 00:22:20,476
I’m heading somewhere.
You stay here.

203
00:22:20,682 --> 00:22:21,682
Okay.

204
00:22:39,035 --> 00:22:40,051
Hi, coach!

205
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:41,512
Hi!

206
00:22:41,537 --> 00:22:42,663
How are you?

207
00:22:42,688 --> 00:22:44,097
Good! I got stuck in traffic.

208
00:22:44,122 --> 00:22:45,748
- Traffic?
- Excuse me.

209
00:22:46,307 --> 00:22:47,934
- Hi, coach!
- Hello!

210
00:22:47,959 --> 00:22:49,894
- How are you all?
- Traffic is crazy today.

211
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:51,320
Traffic?

212
00:22:51,345 --> 00:22:52,345
Traffic.

213
00:22:53,422 --> 00:22:54,495
Denden!

214
00:22:54,810 --> 00:22:55,859
Hi, coach!

215
00:22:55,884 --> 00:22:57,135
Hey, how are you all?

216
00:22:57,160 --> 00:22:58,212
Hi, coach!

217
00:23:06,561 --> 00:23:08,187
- Hello.
- Hello.

218
00:23:08,981 --> 00:23:10,315
Hi, how is everyone?

219
00:23:10,748 --> 00:23:11,791
We’re about to start.

220
00:23:11,816 --> 00:23:14,027
Before we uh—
Before we begin,

221
00:23:14,027 --> 00:23:15,395
let’s warm up first.

222
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,571
Let’s start from the top.

223
00:23:16,571 --> 00:23:17,679
Everyone stand up.

224
00:23:17,934 --> 00:23:19,776
- Stand up.
- Alright, coach.

225
00:23:19,801 --> 00:23:20,812
Okay.

226
00:24:54,877 --> 00:24:56,037
Not everyone

227
00:24:56,170 --> 00:24:57,630
woke up one morning

228
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:59,164
and decided to pole dance.

229
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:00,363
I will be a pole dancer.

230
00:25:00,388 --> 00:25:01,428
It doesn't work like that.

231
00:25:01,521 --> 00:25:05,679
Every pole dancer
I’ve met, um...

232
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,038
they had a reason.

233
00:25:08,141 --> 00:25:09,183
A big reason.

234
00:25:09,208 --> 00:25:10,250
It’s either

235
00:25:10,284 --> 00:25:12,495
death of a family member,

236
00:25:12,520 --> 00:25:13,952
they were heartbroken,

237
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:15,266
or they felt lost.

238
00:25:15,441 --> 00:25:17,652
They always have
a deep reason.

239
00:25:20,987 --> 00:25:22,437
Okay, now Esta.

240
00:25:23,614 --> 00:25:25,834
Dancing helps me

241
00:25:26,175 --> 00:25:28,803
express the feelings

242
00:25:28,828 --> 00:25:30,221
I can't say to

243
00:25:30,246 --> 00:25:32,174
the person in front of me.

244
00:25:32,306 --> 00:25:35,018
I also want to show

245
00:25:35,043 --> 00:25:36,477
who I really am

246
00:25:36,502 --> 00:25:39,262
and the problems
that come my way.

247
00:25:39,305 --> 00:25:41,399
I want to express it
through my dance.

248
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:44,235
But there's something
holding me back.

249
00:25:44,260 --> 00:25:45,923
Since I started pole dancing.

250
00:25:46,062 --> 00:25:48,283
It's this person I love.

251
00:25:49,265 --> 00:25:51,409
Even though he says
that he loves me,

252
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:53,692
there’s this point where...

253
00:25:54,425 --> 00:25:55,742
He loves me, but...

254
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:57,129
it's suffocating.

255
00:25:57,749 --> 00:25:59,083
I wonder if

256
00:25:59,108 --> 00:26:00,892
he really loves me, or...

257
00:26:00,993 --> 00:26:03,287
he just loves me
because he needs me.

258
00:26:04,592 --> 00:26:05,635
That's it...

259
00:26:07,269 --> 00:26:08,382
Oh!

260
00:26:08,482 --> 00:26:12,055
You should all be pressured
because she's new!

261
00:26:12,085 --> 00:26:13,144
So, who's that?

262
00:26:14,642 --> 00:26:15,816
I'm invested.

263
00:26:16,650 --> 00:26:18,386
So nosy!

264
00:26:18,411 --> 00:26:20,966
Seriously? Asking
who the person is?

265
00:26:20,991 --> 00:26:22,370
I'm gonna beat him up.

266
00:26:23,941 --> 00:26:25,276
Thank you, Esta!

267
00:26:25,301 --> 00:26:26,344
And now—

268
00:26:26,369 --> 00:26:27,822
It's teach's turn.

269
00:26:27,847 --> 00:26:30,264
- Your turn.
- Go, teach!

270
00:26:30,264 --> 00:26:31,332
- Pack up.
- Why?

271
00:26:31,357 --> 00:26:32,877
- Kidding.
- Why are you a pole dancer?

272
00:26:33,442 --> 00:26:34,444
Well...

273
00:26:37,087 --> 00:26:38,896
Wait, no crying
because I will cry.

274
00:26:38,950 --> 00:26:40,002
Okay.

275
00:26:42,640 --> 00:26:44,403
Uh, for me,

276
00:26:44,403 --> 00:26:45,873
dancing is

277
00:26:46,366 --> 00:26:48,048
my escape.

278
00:26:50,253 --> 00:26:52,545
Because when I dance,

279
00:26:54,304 --> 00:26:57,641
You know that feeling when all
the problems in my mind disappear.

280
00:26:58,523 --> 00:27:01,575
It's when I have to
carry myself through,

281
00:27:02,084 --> 00:27:04,528
and also show me that in life,

282
00:27:04,632 --> 00:27:05,758
no one will help me

283
00:27:05,758 --> 00:27:07,510
but myself.

284
00:27:07,535 --> 00:27:09,169
That’s why I need to lift myself up.

285
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:11,030
And of course,

286
00:27:11,055 --> 00:27:13,074
there will always be people

287
00:27:13,099 --> 00:27:15,521
who judge me because

288
00:27:15,768 --> 00:27:18,354
I also feel like

289
00:27:18,406 --> 00:27:20,248
I'm not accepted by
the people around me

290
00:27:20,273 --> 00:27:22,317
because of what I do,

291
00:27:22,756 --> 00:27:24,913
from what they know...

292
00:27:25,153 --> 00:27:26,237
It's lewd.

293
00:27:26,263 --> 00:27:28,102
What we're doing is lewd.

294
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:31,300
But for me,

295
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:32,326
dancing is

296
00:27:32,351 --> 00:27:33,523
my escape.

297
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:37,782
The things I'm
going through in life.

298
00:27:37,807 --> 00:27:40,029
That's why I like it to...

299
00:27:40,054 --> 00:27:41,529
That's why I want to teach,

300
00:27:42,331 --> 00:27:44,334
because what I’ve gone through,

301
00:27:45,126 --> 00:27:46,534
I overcame it.

302
00:27:46,883 --> 00:27:49,093
I want to teach that to you.

303
00:27:49,218 --> 00:27:52,534
Overcome what you're
going through too.

304
00:27:52,902 --> 00:27:53,986
That's it.

305
00:28:09,512 --> 00:28:10,844
Where have you been?

306
00:28:12,250 --> 00:28:14,070
I just went somewhere, babe.

307
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,900
Uh...

308
00:28:16,254 --> 00:28:17,454
Can we talk?

309
00:28:19,277 --> 00:28:20,277
Um...

310
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:22,468
I still have something to finish.

311
00:28:24,874 --> 00:28:27,685
I just want to say...

312
00:28:31,762 --> 00:28:32,762
Hello?

313
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:35,881
Yeah?

314
00:29:00,205 --> 00:29:01,886
ESTA: Where are you?

315
00:29:01,911 --> 00:29:04,425
Babe, pick up the phone.

316
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:07,260
I've been calling you.

317
00:29:07,305 --> 00:29:10,104
ALFIE: I'm on a business trip.

318
00:29:10,178 --> 00:29:13,388
Let's talk when I get back.

319
00:35:00,842 --> 00:35:02,526
- Bye, coach!
- Bye!

320
00:35:02,526 --> 00:35:03,777
- Bye, teach!
- Let's go have a drink.

321
00:35:03,777 --> 00:35:05,404
- We'll go ahead.
- You guys!

322
00:35:05,404 --> 00:35:07,197
- Next time.
- Okay!

323
00:35:07,197 --> 00:35:08,782
- Alright, bye!
- Take care.

324
00:35:08,782 --> 00:35:10,075
Bye!

325
00:35:21,785 --> 00:35:22,828
Why?

326
00:35:24,757 --> 00:35:26,783
Teach, I have a something.

327
00:35:26,967 --> 00:35:28,040
For you.

328
00:35:33,115 --> 00:35:34,867
What? Food?

329
00:35:34,892 --> 00:35:37,227
Yes. As thanks.

330
00:35:38,145 --> 00:35:40,092
Come on. You did great earlier.

331
00:35:46,570 --> 00:35:48,072
Let's eat here.

332
00:35:49,281 --> 00:35:50,783
Alright, let's go.

333
00:36:17,226 --> 00:36:18,309
Esta?

334
00:36:19,311 --> 00:36:20,395
Esta!

335
00:36:31,407 --> 00:36:32,459
Hey.

336
00:36:32,512 --> 00:36:34,421
I thought you were
on a business trip?

337
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:37,003
I just got back earlier.

338
00:36:38,213 --> 00:36:39,389
Where’s Esta?

339
00:36:39,904 --> 00:36:41,019
You know Esta.

340
00:36:43,134 --> 00:36:44,886
Honestly, you learn fast.

341
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:49,059
Your spins are clean.

342
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:51,090
Your dancing is beautiful.

343
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:52,730
Your core strength is amazing.

344
00:36:52,964 --> 00:36:54,273
Are you really a dancer?

345
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:55,702
Before,

346
00:36:55,919 --> 00:36:57,956
but I stopped a long time ago.

347
00:36:58,533 --> 00:37:00,327
My boyfriend

348
00:37:00,826 --> 00:37:03,151
doesn't support what I do.

349
00:37:03,245 --> 00:37:04,377
In my hobby.

350
00:37:04,606 --> 00:37:05,858
In my hobby, right?

351
00:37:08,786 --> 00:37:09,842
You know,

352
00:37:09,874 --> 00:37:11,216
At first, I thought

353
00:37:12,618 --> 00:37:13,821
I couldn't do it,

354
00:37:14,258 --> 00:37:15,384
but look.

355
00:37:15,409 --> 00:37:16,698
I managed to do it.

356
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:18,253
Thank you, teach!

357
00:37:19,314 --> 00:37:21,700
And you should
also thank yourself

358
00:37:22,974 --> 00:37:24,014
Because...

359
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:27,364
You followed what
you really wanted.

360
00:37:28,828 --> 00:37:30,941
You know if your
boyfriend sees you.

361
00:37:31,398 --> 00:37:33,137
He will be so proud of you

362
00:37:33,761 --> 00:37:35,503
because you're good.

363
00:37:36,139 --> 00:37:38,796
He's not impressed
with how he sees me.

364
00:37:39,247 --> 00:37:41,316
That's why I hid this from him

365
00:37:41,341 --> 00:37:42,713
because I know that

366
00:37:43,723 --> 00:37:45,684
he would be disappointed in me.

367
00:37:48,025 --> 00:37:49,930
You don't even
look for your wife.

368
00:37:51,429 --> 00:37:52,569
She's not my wife yet.

369
00:37:53,379 --> 00:37:54,482
We're just living together.

370
00:37:55,699 --> 00:37:57,706
Where are you going?
You partying tonight?

371
00:37:57,993 --> 00:37:59,385
I'm really going out.

372
00:38:00,275 --> 00:38:01,794
I'm looking for
some fun tonight.

373
00:38:02,986 --> 00:38:04,821
I was planning to
bring Esta along.

374
00:38:11,348 --> 00:38:12,515
Alright, I'm going home now.

375
00:38:15,260 --> 00:38:16,287
Stay here.

376
00:38:17,656 --> 00:38:19,324
Fun tonight.

377
00:38:20,296 --> 00:38:22,423
You know Esta,
I understand you.

378
00:38:24,551 --> 00:38:25,971
You’ll think about whether

379
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:27,706
you want to live

380
00:38:27,731 --> 00:38:29,538
for other people's expectations,

381
00:38:29,775 --> 00:38:30,831
Or...

382
00:38:31,140 --> 00:38:32,252
If you want to live

383
00:38:32,277 --> 00:38:34,277
to be true to yourself.

384
00:38:35,506 --> 00:38:36,673
Of course, you would choose

385
00:38:36,698 --> 00:38:38,181
where your heart is happy.

386
00:38:39,010 --> 00:38:41,122
Where your soul can breathe.

387
00:38:43,997 --> 00:38:45,547
Where you will be free.

388
00:38:54,432 --> 00:38:56,192
You know, Athena.

389
00:38:58,899 --> 00:39:00,713
I'm happy I met you.

390
00:39:04,181 --> 00:39:05,210
Okay.

391
00:39:08,882 --> 00:39:10,044
Stay here for now.

392
00:39:11,992 --> 00:39:13,660
Fun tonight.

393
00:39:17,489 --> 00:39:19,786
Screw you! Are you
getting hard for me?

394
00:39:20,026 --> 00:39:21,306
It’s been like that for a while.

395
00:39:21,869 --> 00:39:23,674
Come on, she won't find out.

396
00:47:33,995 --> 00:47:34,995
Claire.

397
00:47:35,945 --> 00:47:37,254
You dropped by.

398
00:47:38,181 --> 00:47:39,215
Hey, you!

399
00:47:39,240 --> 00:47:40,852
You’re hiding
something from me.

400
00:47:42,086 --> 00:47:43,140
Huh?

401
00:47:46,908 --> 00:47:47,968
This.

402
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:50,018
You’ve enrolled in

403
00:47:50,043 --> 00:47:51,319
a pole dancing class.

404
00:47:51,836 --> 00:47:53,671
You didn’t even tell me.

405
00:47:55,573 --> 00:47:56,598
Pole dancer?

406
00:48:13,896 --> 00:48:15,187
Why didn’t I know about this?

407
00:48:20,140 --> 00:48:21,168
Babe.

408
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:24,009
I was going to tell you.

409
00:48:24,619 --> 00:48:26,913
It’s just that the
timing wasn't right.

410
00:48:29,619 --> 00:48:31,183
You’ve been so busy.

411
00:48:34,421 --> 00:48:36,256
That’s why you
keep taking leaves.

412
00:48:37,257 --> 00:48:38,497
This is what you’ve been up to.

413
00:48:45,515 --> 00:48:46,600
Alfie, wait!

414
00:48:55,108 --> 00:48:56,568
Bestie,

415
00:48:56,568 --> 00:48:57,641
sorry.

416
00:48:58,069 --> 00:48:59,404
I didn’t know.

417
00:49:56,586 --> 00:49:58,338
This is where you pole dance.

418
00:49:59,553 --> 00:50:01,015
This is what I want, Alfie.

419
00:50:05,187 --> 00:50:06,230
Okay.

420
00:50:07,264 --> 00:50:09,475
If this is what you want,
I’ll support you.

421
00:50:11,285 --> 00:50:12,305
- Esta!
- I’ll try.

422
00:50:15,826 --> 00:50:16,826
Uh...

423
00:50:18,269 --> 00:50:19,351
Athena,

424
00:50:19,825 --> 00:50:20,958
this is Alfie.

425
00:50:21,216 --> 00:50:22,342
My boyfriend.

426
00:50:27,287 --> 00:50:28,861
Nice to meet you, teach.

427
00:50:30,201 --> 00:50:31,376
Nice to meet you, Alfie.

428
00:50:36,034 --> 00:50:37,161
I’ll go ahead.

429
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:52,182
Alfie.

430
00:50:53,930 --> 00:50:54,963
Thank you.

431
00:50:57,404 --> 00:50:58,680
Okay, go inside.

432
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:44,244
Where have you been?

433
00:51:45,381 --> 00:51:47,212
The bosses just
invited me to drink.

434
00:51:51,384 --> 00:51:52,813
I’m going to shower first.

435
00:51:59,473 --> 00:52:00,473
[sighs]

436
00:52:36,785 --> 00:52:38,614
Hello, Alfie?

437
00:52:39,295 --> 00:52:40,345
Sorry.

438
00:52:40,833 --> 00:52:42,864
I can't handle this anymore.

439
00:52:43,131 --> 00:52:45,271
I feel so guilty
for betraying Esta.

440
00:52:46,328 --> 00:52:47,439
Let's stop this.

441
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:53,735
Sorry but thank you.
I had a good time.

442
00:52:56,762 --> 00:52:57,783
Alfie?

443
00:53:52,293 --> 00:53:53,868
ESTA: I don't want this anymore,
let's break up.

444
00:53:53,892 --> 00:53:54,927
ALFIE: What the hell
are you talking about?

445
00:53:54,951 --> 00:53:56,635
Are you serious? What happened?
Did I do something?

446
00:53:56,659 --> 00:53:57,848
Esta, let's talk about this.

447
00:53:57,893 --> 00:53:58,893
Where are you?

448
00:54:20,641 --> 00:54:21,644
What happened?

449
00:54:24,353 --> 00:54:25,854
Alfie

450
00:54:26,355 --> 00:54:27,434
and Claire.

451
00:54:29,942 --> 00:54:31,382
They lied to me.

452
00:54:32,653 --> 00:54:34,548
I don't know what to do.

453
00:54:43,331 --> 00:54:45,033
Stay at my place for now.

454
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,809
Come on.

455
00:55:25,623 --> 00:55:26,874
What’s going on?

456
00:55:34,215 --> 00:55:35,258
Shall we go?

457
00:55:51,292 --> 00:55:52,320
What are you doing?

458
00:55:57,461 --> 00:55:59,155
What do you do here?

459
00:56:01,095 --> 00:56:03,160
What is this studio?

460
00:56:06,556 --> 00:56:08,641
Do you do your students here?

461
00:56:08,666 --> 00:56:10,048
Do you do this all the time?

462
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:14,010
Hmm? Is this part of your job?

463
00:56:15,775 --> 00:56:17,423
Is this part of
being a teacher?

464
00:56:18,801 --> 00:56:20,003
Alfie.

465
00:56:20,117 --> 00:56:22,043
Are you even going
to go after my wife?

466
00:56:22,446 --> 00:56:23,907
- What are you doing?
- Enough, Alfie.

467
00:56:23,931 --> 00:56:26,183
- Enough, please.
- Is this part of your course?

468
00:56:26,851 --> 00:56:28,714
Is this part of your plan?

469
00:56:30,746 --> 00:56:31,747
Enough, please.

470
00:56:31,772 --> 00:56:32,815
Enough, Alfie!

471
00:56:32,840 --> 00:56:34,623
- Enough! Enough, please!
- Why?

472
00:56:35,003 --> 00:56:37,398
- Alfie!
- Did you think I wouldn’t fight back?

473
00:56:37,445 --> 00:56:39,182
Enough! Enough!

474
00:56:39,213 --> 00:56:40,256
Please!

475
00:56:40,281 --> 00:56:41,939
- Damn you!
- What?

476
00:56:42,283 --> 00:56:44,994
- Did you think I didn’t know?
- Did she touch you?

477
00:56:45,696 --> 00:56:46,799
You asshole!

478
00:56:46,824 --> 00:56:50,015
You! You did it
with my best friend!

479
00:56:51,126 --> 00:56:52,350
Did you think I didn’t know?

480
00:57:11,020 --> 00:57:12,220
It was just a one-night stand.

481
00:57:13,623 --> 00:57:15,342
It only happened
once between us.

482
00:57:15,699 --> 00:57:16,829
I was drunk.

483
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,380
You...

484
00:57:21,032 --> 00:57:23,118
How many times
did you touch my wife?

485
00:57:24,091 --> 00:57:26,385
Which part of her
body didn't you lick?

486
00:57:26,410 --> 00:57:27,776
Did you get enough of her?

487
00:57:28,025 --> 00:57:30,146
- Huh?
- Did you had fun?

488
00:57:32,384 --> 00:57:33,427
Did you enjoy it?

489
00:57:33,918 --> 00:57:35,876
Are you happy with
what you did, teach?

490
00:57:36,514 --> 00:57:38,955
- What?
- You ruined our relationship.

491
00:57:41,129 --> 00:57:42,703
Are you stupid? Huh?

492
00:57:42,802 --> 00:57:44,469
Enough! Stop it!

493
00:57:45,012 --> 00:57:46,631
- Enough!
- Damn you!

494
00:57:47,473 --> 00:57:48,516
Alfie!

495
00:58:30,875 --> 00:58:33,089
You’re at fault.
I’m at fault.

496
00:58:33,644 --> 00:58:35,036
And I'm sorry, okay?

497
00:58:36,956 --> 00:58:38,373
I know we can fix this.

498
00:58:39,902 --> 00:58:41,474
I'm sorry, don't cry anymore.

499
00:58:41,944 --> 00:58:42,994
I'm sorry.

500
00:58:46,574 --> 00:58:47,674
I'm sorry.

501
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:51,973
Let's fix this at home, okay?

502
00:58:55,170 --> 00:58:56,308
I'm sorry.

503
00:58:57,497 --> 00:58:58,602
Let's go home.

504
00:59:00,609 --> 00:59:01,629
Shall we?

505
00:59:07,094 --> 00:59:08,679
Let's go, let's go.

506
01:05:54,331 --> 01:05:55,957
Not all mistakes

507
01:05:55,957 --> 01:05:57,617
should be regretted.

508
01:06:01,671 --> 01:06:02,691
Sometimes,

509
01:06:03,104 --> 01:06:04,856
we need to experience them.

510
01:06:04,881 --> 01:06:05,965
To see how

511
01:06:05,990 --> 01:06:08,433
much we love ourselves.

512
01:06:17,432 --> 01:06:19,668
And the right
person will come.

513
01:06:20,769 --> 01:06:22,712
Not at the right time,

514
01:06:23,730 --> 01:06:25,882
but at the right
version of yourself.

515
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:36,225
I met her

516
01:06:36,541 --> 01:06:38,936
not in a time of certainty.

517
01:06:39,720 --> 01:06:40,846
But in a time of

518
01:06:40,871 --> 01:06:42,899
being true to myself.

519
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,197
They say timing is wrong.

520
01:06:50,048 --> 01:06:52,885
But who really can say

521
01:06:52,885 --> 01:06:54,536
when we are right?

522
01:06:58,702 --> 01:07:00,020
What matters

523
01:07:00,325 --> 01:07:01,918
is that you’re free now.

524
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,173
And at last

525
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:09,052
you accept the love

526
01:07:09,077 --> 01:07:11,271
you once fought for.

527
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:16,148
But now

528
01:07:16,173 --> 01:07:17,976
it comes to you willingly.

529
01:07:21,024 --> 01:07:22,126
Whole,

530
01:07:24,366 --> 01:07:25,610
real,

531
01:07:26,184 --> 01:07:28,027
and it will help you grow.
