1
00:04:38,459 --> 00:04:40,584
I love you forever.

2
00:05:05,167 --> 00:05:07,584
Nessie, I have something to tell you.

3
00:05:11,167 --> 00:05:12,417
Anything.

4
00:05:23,167 --> 00:05:27,417
This is our last chance.

5
00:05:32,334 --> 00:05:34,542
She and I are getting married next week.

6
00:05:42,083 --> 00:05:44,209
Why all of a sudden?

7
00:05:50,125 --> 00:05:53,375
I need to focus on my preparation.

8
00:05:54,709 --> 00:05:56,042
And one more thing.

9
00:05:56,834 --> 00:05:59,500
It's obvious that it's about Sean.

10
00:05:59,834 --> 00:06:01,334
So that's it?

11
00:06:03,626 --> 00:06:05,834
I'll never forget you?

12
00:06:17,709 --> 00:06:19,167
I'm sorry

13
00:06:32,209 --> 00:06:33,459
That's what I'm saying.

14
00:06:35,042 --> 00:06:37,083
What can I do?

15
00:06:42,876 --> 00:06:44,876
You're alive, Nessie.

16
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,792
Be strong.

17
00:06:50,584 --> 00:06:52,209
That's What I'll do.

18
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:58,584
But remember,

19
00:07:01,834 --> 00:07:03,959
I love so much.

20
00:07:48,959 --> 00:07:52,042
By the power vested in me by
the Republic of the Philippines,

21
00:07:52,584 --> 00:07:57,542
I now pronounce you, Sean Melendez
and Christina Aguilar as husband and wife.

22
00:07:58,042 --> 00:08:00,626
Congratulations, you may now kiss the bridge.

23
00:08:57,292 --> 00:08:58,167
Bro,

24
00:08:59,417 --> 00:09:01,083
I'm glad you're here.

25
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,959
Of course.

26
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:08,125
I was just arranging my
schedule so I could come here.

27
00:09:08,417 --> 00:09:09,792
You know me, bro.

28
00:09:09,792 --> 00:09:12,626
How could I miss my best friend's wedding?

29
00:09:12,918 --> 00:09:13,918
Come on!

30
00:09:17,834 --> 00:09:18,834
Do you want me to kick you out?

31
00:09:18,876 --> 00:09:20,042
Of course!

32
00:09:20,584 --> 00:09:21,876
Bro, you have to come home with me.

33
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:22,667
Why?

34
00:09:22,918 --> 00:09:24,709
You're always late for weddings.

35
00:09:24,751 --> 00:09:26,125
I've been telling you this for a while.

36
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:28,459
Have you eaten?

37
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:29,709
I'm in the kitchen.

38
00:09:29,792 --> 00:09:32,542
Mom, you should be with your husband.

39
00:09:32,542 --> 00:09:34,626
Even if you haven't seen each other for a while,

40
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:36,584
you should be with him.

41
00:09:36,626 --> 00:09:37,709
Because you're getting married today.

42
00:09:37,792 --> 00:09:38,667
Mom,

43
00:09:38,709 --> 00:09:40,876
I just want to talk to my best friend, Doc Viz.

44
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:43,542
I'm busy.

45
00:09:43,584 --> 00:09:45,125
I'm Late.

46
00:09:46,167 --> 00:09:47,417
You should go to your husband.

47
00:09:47,459 --> 00:09:49,542
Mom, you're right.

48
00:09:49,584 --> 00:09:51,000
You should go to your husband.

49
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Go ahead.

50
00:09:52,459 --> 00:09:55,667
Mom, you're the one who's charge
here at my best friend's wedding.

51
00:09:56,334 --> 00:09:57,292
Go ahead.

52
00:09:57,334 --> 00:09:58,042
Go, go, go.

53
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,292
Mom, you're right.

54
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:00,667
I'm so happy.

55
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:03,667
I did everything I could to get here.

56
00:10:03,751 --> 00:10:04,876
I'm busy.

57
00:10:05,417 --> 00:10:06,959
Okay, thank you.

58
00:12:46,667 --> 00:12:49,417
I hope you're happy your decision.

59
00:12:51,292 --> 00:12:52,959
Take care, Pristina.

60
00:12:55,542 --> 00:12:57,709
I love you,

61
00:12:58,792 --> 00:13:01,667
Nessie, what are you doing?

62
00:13:04,334 --> 00:13:07,876
Don't stop me. I want to go home.

63
00:13:08,584 --> 00:13:09,751
Nessie...

64
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:11,792
Nessie...

65
00:13:12,292 --> 00:13:18,125
You're not good enough. Why
are you taking your own life?

66
00:13:18,167 --> 00:13:20,709
A lot of people love you.

67
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:28,626
I know it hurts but you'll get over it.

68
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:35,417
You'll get to a point where
you won't feel the pain anymore.

69
00:13:36,959 --> 00:13:40,959
I can't take it anymore.

70
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:44,733
I can't take it anymore.

71
00:13:45,313 --> 00:13:50,934
I can't take the pain anymore.

72
00:13:51,038 --> 00:13:55,271
Let it go. You're too strong.

73
00:13:56,121 --> 00:13:59,031
We've known each other for a long time.

74
00:13:56,178 --> 00:13:59,164
Let it go. You're too strong.

75
00:13:59,164 --> 00:14:01,411
I know you're not a coward.

76
00:14:02,237 --> 00:14:06,837
I can't  take it anymore.

77
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:09,305
Please help yourself.

78
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:11,018
Make your life busy.

79
00:14:11,078 --> 00:14:14,191
Pay attention to our patients.

80
00:14:14,264 --> 00:14:16,691
If you want, you can double shift.

81
00:14:16,692 --> 00:14:17,932
I'll go with you.

82
00:14:18,118 --> 00:14:21,182
You need to forget this.

83
00:14:21,216 --> 00:14:22,783
Help yourself.

84
00:14:22,909 --> 00:14:27,149
You don't deserve the pain you're feeling.

85
00:14:27,196 --> 00:14:29,243
Come here.

86
00:14:46,239 --> 00:14:52,856
AFTER 2 YEARS

87
00:15:02,102 --> 00:15:03,302
Sir, let's eat.

88
00:15:07,686 --> 00:15:08,888
Can you move aside?

89
00:15:09,308 --> 00:15:10,348
I'm drooling.

90
00:15:14,168 --> 00:15:15,738
Move aside!

91
00:15:17,165 --> 00:15:18,685
You're so annoying!

92
00:15:20,358 --> 00:15:22,208
Get out of my way!

93
00:15:27,042 --> 00:15:27,889
Han, Han!

94
00:15:29,313 --> 00:15:31,789
You're the one who's taking care of him!

95
00:15:31,929 --> 00:15:33,374
Don't take care of me!

96
00:15:33,709 --> 00:15:35,045
Do you want to die?

97
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,865
This is a life!

98
00:15:39,662 --> 00:15:41,262
What's your problem?

99
00:15:42,847 --> 00:15:45,513
Vins said that your foot is fine, right?

100
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,832
You're the only one who needs go to therapy.

101
00:15:49,134 --> 00:15:50,134
Fine?

102
00:15:50,979 --> 00:15:53,179
Look at me!
Am I the one who's fine?

103
00:15:53,819 --> 00:15:56,197
I've been sitting on this chair for months!

104
00:15:56,523 --> 00:15:59,940
If you're not going to therapy,
you're not going to get out of that chair!

105
00:16:02,081 --> 00:16:04,571
Ma'am, I'm leaving.

106
00:16:04,838 --> 00:16:06,534
Please take this.

107
00:16:07,012 --> 00:16:08,012
Thank you.

108
00:16:17,273 --> 00:16:18,273
Han.

109
00:16:20,011 --> 00:16:21,011
Han.

110
00:16:21,091 --> 00:16:22,091
I'm sorry.

111
00:16:23,925 --> 00:16:25,605
Han, you're doing great.

112
00:16:26,641 --> 00:16:28,841
Okay, we just need to be patient.

113
00:16:31,489 --> 00:16:34,716
I'll call Vins again.

114
00:16:36,056 --> 00:16:37,496
I'll be going now.

115
00:16:49,275 --> 00:16:50,603
Hey, Nessie.

116
00:16:50,938 --> 00:16:53,071
Why did Dr. Vins call you again?

117
00:16:54,527 --> 00:16:57,260
I want to get his friend's private nurse.

118
00:16:57,362 --> 00:16:59,496
What about your shift at the hospital?

119
00:17:00,132 --> 00:17:02,107
He's in charge of your schedule.

120
00:17:02,362 --> 00:17:04,750
He's the one who's in charge of the hospital.

121
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:06,857
But what's the patient's case?

122
00:17:07,437 --> 00:17:08,637
Incomplete SCI.

123
00:17:10,007 --> 00:17:11,858
He's supposed to be in therapy.

124
00:17:11,964 --> 00:17:13,211
He's afraid of the hospital.

125
00:17:13,739 --> 00:17:14,531
That's why.

126
00:17:14,676 --> 00:17:16,781
That's why you need a private nurse.

127
00:17:17,014 --> 00:17:19,281
But what if You're afraid of that?

128
00:17:20,978 --> 00:17:23,986
It's higher that what you earn at the hospital.
But...

129
00:17:24,694 --> 00:17:26,380
I'm still thinking about it.

130
00:17:26,474 --> 00:17:30,349
Girl, don't think about those things.

131
00:17:30,483 --> 00:17:31,693
It's a waste.

132
00:17:32,947 --> 00:17:33,893
You're right.

133
00:17:34,501 --> 00:17:36,616
Let's eat some alimtes.

134
00:17:36,714 --> 00:17:37,994
So we can sleep.

135
00:17:38,127 --> 00:17:39,127
Okay, but...

136
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,720
I'm free.

137
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:43,275
Okay, fine!

138
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,807
You're so annoying.

139
00:17:44,846 --> 00:17:46,433
Love you, bestie!

140
00:17:58,145 --> 00:17:59,825
Hon, Hon, are you okay?

141
00:18:03,834 --> 00:18:04,954
I had a dream.

142
00:18:06,297 --> 00:18:07,897
I had a dream again.

143
00:18:11,412 --> 00:18:12,852
It's just a dream.

144
00:18:14,005 --> 00:18:16,065
Let's go to sleep.

145
00:18:41,315 --> 00:18:43,582
Mario, what are you doing here?

146
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:46,155
I was transferred to our main office.

147
00:18:46,382 --> 00:18:47,702
I'm here for training.

148
00:18:48,062 --> 00:18:49,062
Wow!

149
00:18:49,569 --> 00:18:51,249
My brother is on time.

150
00:18:52,332 --> 00:18:53,332
Come in.

151
00:18:54,423 --> 00:18:55,423
Hi, Ate.

152
00:18:58,784 --> 00:18:59,784
Hey, Ana.

153
00:19:00,292 --> 00:19:01,332
You're naked!

154
00:19:02,425 --> 00:19:03,425
This is Ana.

155
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:04,743
She's my housemate.

156
00:19:04,817 --> 00:19:05,844
She's also a nurse.

157
00:19:05,924 --> 00:19:06,731
Oh, nice.

158
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,763
Nice to meet you, Ana.

159
00:19:07,850 --> 00:19:10,223
Nice to meet you, too, huh?

160
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:14,063
Nessie, you never said you had a sister.

161
00:19:14,143 --> 00:19:16,163
You're so annoying.
She's my sister.

162
00:19:16,383 --> 00:19:17,423
What's your problem?

163
00:19:17,469 --> 00:19:19,456
You're so annoying!
You know that?

164
00:19:19,536 --> 00:19:20,656
We're sisters.

165
00:19:21,603 --> 00:19:22,603
Wait.

166
00:19:22,776 --> 00:19:23,883
You're a girl?

167
00:19:24,850 --> 00:19:25,870
What did you say?

168
00:19:26,163 --> 00:19:27,329
Of course. I'm a girl.

169
00:19:27,350 --> 00:19:28,783
It's not obvious.

170
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:30,255
Sorry, Nessie.

171
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,749
I thought you were my sister.

172
00:19:33,122 --> 00:19:34,242
FYI,

173
00:19:34,895 --> 00:19:36,575
I'm not like your sister.

174
00:19:37,123 --> 00:19:38,323
I am different.

175
00:19:38,809 --> 00:19:39,809
I'm sorry.

176
00:19:41,509 --> 00:19:43,464
You're like kids.

177
00:19:43,803 --> 00:19:45,163
I'll just change.

178
00:19:45,323 --> 00:19:46,523
I'll go to Doc.

179
00:19:47,687 --> 00:19:48,687
Ate.

180
00:19:49,163 --> 00:19:50,998
can I stay here?

181
00:19:51,458 --> 00:19:54,227
I don't have to pay for the boarding house.
Of course.

182
00:19:54,638 --> 00:19:56,438
You don't have to say that.

183
00:19:56,761 --> 00:19:57,831
Actually, it's perfect.

184
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:00,299
You brother has a new racket.

185
00:20:00,298 --> 00:20:02,544
That's why he's here every weekend.

186
00:20:03,397 --> 00:20:04,024
Nice.

187
00:20:04,164 --> 00:20:05,064
Thank you, Ate.

188
00:20:05,090 --> 00:20:06,253
You're so nice.

189
00:20:13,076 --> 00:20:14,169
Good afternoon, Doc.

190
00:20:14,289 --> 00:20:15,716
Oh, Nesli! Have a seat.

191
00:20:16,151 --> 00:20:16,629
Thank you.

192
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:18,822
Hey, you know what?

193
00:20:19,276 --> 00:20:24,059
After thoroughly reading all your resumes
and checking on all your hospital reckords,

194
00:20:25,014 --> 00:20:26,014
I've decided

195
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:29,547
that you're the best nurse for my friend.

196
00:20:31,086 --> 00:20:31,660
Doc.

197
00:20:32,121 --> 00:20:33,914
Thank you for trusting me.

198
00:20:34,975 --> 00:20:36,655
I have a suggestion, Doc.

199
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:37,701
Go ahead.

200
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:40,351
Why don't we just bring her rehab to her house?

201
00:20:40,351 --> 00:20:42,224
The patient doesn't want to go, right?

202
00:20:44,146 --> 00:20:45,146
At least,

203
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:46,945
the patient's not sick anymore.

204
00:20:47,705 --> 00:20:48,823
Well, that's a great idea.

205
00:20:49,179 --> 00:20:50,339
That's why I wasn't wrong.

206
00:20:50,339 --> 00:20:52,436
about you being the best nurse for Sean.

207
00:20:54,761 --> 00:20:55,761
Sean?

208
00:20:56,994 --> 00:20:58,041
Didn't I tell you

209
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,447
that the patient's name is Sean Melendez?

210
00:21:01,328 --> 00:21:03,239
And that you will start tomorrow morning?

211
00:21:06,007 --> 00:21:07,287
Here's the addres.

212
00:21:08,448 --> 00:21:10,055
I'll just call his wife

213
00:21:10,161 --> 00:21:13,845
and tell her that you'll be there
at 7 a.m. tomorrow morning.

214
00:21:17,236 --> 00:21:18,500
Okay, then.

215
00:21:19,594 --> 00:21:20,670
Thank you, Nessie.

216
00:21:22,514 --> 00:21:23,743
And I'm counting on you.

217
00:21:24,910 --> 00:21:25,910
Yes, Doc.
Okay?

218
00:21:26,356 --> 00:21:27,649
Thank you.
Good luck.

219
00:21:46,994 --> 00:21:48,677
Good morning.

220
00:21:50,795 --> 00:21:52,862
Who are they? Want do you need?

221
00:21:53,462 --> 00:21:56,972
I'm the new nurse sent by Doc Vince de la Cruz.

222
00:21:57,154 --> 00:21:59,359
Oh, is that you? Come in.

223
00:21:59,891 --> 00:22:02,691
Ma'am Christina is waiting for you inside.

224
00:22:03,841 --> 00:22:04,841
Good luck.

225
00:22:09,390 --> 00:22:10,830
Good morning, Pop.

226
00:22:11,706 --> 00:22:12,706
Mom.

227
00:22:15,017 --> 00:22:16,017
Nessie.

228
00:22:17,223 --> 00:22:18,903
what are you doing here?

229
00:22:19,952 --> 00:22:22,019
How did you know where we live?

230
00:22:22,478 --> 00:22:25,553
Doc Vins sent me here.

231
00:22:26,658 --> 00:22:29,602
I didn't know that my patient is your husband.

232
00:22:31,583 --> 00:22:32,583
No.

233
00:22:33,892 --> 00:22:36,026
You can't be my husband's nurse.

234
00:22:36,444 --> 00:22:37,444
Why not?

235
00:22:37,981 --> 00:22:40,257
Of all the nurses who applied to Doc Vins.

236
00:22:40,424 --> 00:22:41,819
I'm the best.

237
00:22:42,099 --> 00:22:45,363
I'm more than qualified to be your husband's nurse.

238
00:22:47,070 --> 00:22:49,974
Maybe you don't want to because you haven't forgotten me.

239
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,748
Ate, eat up.

240
00:22:57,344 --> 00:22:58,955
I already cooked.

241
00:23:02,812 --> 00:23:06,065
No. I'll just eat at the office.

242
00:23:15,251 --> 00:23:18,337
Just tell the nurse about her room.

243
00:23:19,141 --> 00:23:21,208
And when your brother wakes up,

244
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:25,547
bring him with you to the kitchen.

245
00:23:25,788 --> 00:23:26,788
Okay, Ate.

246
00:23:28,554 --> 00:23:29,834
Let's eat first.

247
00:23:30,274 --> 00:23:32,207
I'll just put my stuff there.

248
00:23:35,343 --> 00:23:37,143
Oh, by the way, I'm Minnie.

249
00:23:37,771 --> 00:23:38,771
I'm Lucy.

250
00:23:39,009 --> 00:23:40,009
Let's go.

251
00:23:56,712 --> 00:24:00,145
Oh, it's him. Your new nurse, Nessie.

252
00:24:01,096 --> 00:24:03,052
Good morning, Sir Sean. I'm Nessie.

253
00:24:03,633 --> 00:24:05,433
Doc also bought you for me.

254
00:24:06,052 --> 00:24:09,444
You're so annoying, Vivian.
You said don't need nurse.

255
00:24:10,371 --> 00:24:11,939
I'm sorry, sir.

256
00:24:13,003 --> 00:24:15,927
Doc was just thinking about the good things in your life.

257
00:24:15,927 --> 00:24:18,999
I'll do everything to make your recovery faster.

258
00:24:19,047 --> 00:24:20,047
Really?

259
00:24:20,661 --> 00:24:23,375
That's why I've been
sitting in a chair with a wheel.

260
00:24:24,031 --> 00:24:26,564
That's what the nurses told me before.

261
00:24:26,734 --> 00:24:30,190
You'll follow my instructions.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

262
00:24:30,770 --> 00:24:32,290
We'll start with...

263
00:24:36,289 --> 00:24:38,481
This is the medicine you need to take.

264
00:24:38,793 --> 00:24:41,902
From now on, I'll make you take it.

265
00:24:42,274 --> 00:24:48,126
After that, we'll go out to get some fresh air and sun.

266
00:24:49,577 --> 00:24:50,873
What if I don't want to?

267
00:24:52,007 --> 00:24:53,687
Can you do something?

268
00:24:55,787 --> 00:24:57,147
You can't say no.

269
00:24:57,292 --> 00:25:00,032
Because I'm Doc Vins.

270
00:25:00,087 --> 00:25:03,071
I'll tell you that you need to go to the hospital.

271
00:25:03,359 --> 00:25:04,706
You'll get better there.

272
00:25:04,746 --> 00:25:06,106
Do you want that?

273
00:25:10,634 --> 00:25:12,314
So, what's your decision?

274
00:25:17,695 --> 00:25:18,695
Silly.

275
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,261
Tee. Is something wrong?

276
00:25:40,142 --> 00:25:41,833
You're not yourself.

277
00:25:42,560 --> 00:25:43,600
It's nothing.

278
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:46,727
I'm just thinking about what I'll do for training later.

279
00:25:46,726 --> 00:25:47,726
Really?

280
00:25:47,681 --> 00:25:50,158
I thought you're going through something again.

281
00:25:50,633 --> 00:25:52,313
I'll just stay here okay?

282
00:25:54,513 --> 00:25:55,513
Of course.

283
00:25:56,226 --> 00:25:57,686
And thank you so much.

284
00:25:58,282 --> 00:25:59,635
That's it!

285
00:25:59,693 --> 00:26:00,685
Cheer up!

286
00:26:00,706 --> 00:26:03,833
You might think that you're back to being a handsome husband.

287
00:26:04,604 --> 00:26:07,403
You still don't want to stop being a handsome husband.

288
00:26:08,383 --> 00:26:10,436
Thank you for not hitting on me.

289
00:26:10,589 --> 00:26:12,589
If your wife knows about this.

290
00:26:13,434 --> 00:26:15,074
you're done for.

291
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:18,901
That's enough, okay?

292
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:22,494
Go away. I might slap you.

293
00:26:22,494 --> 00:26:23,494
What?

294
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:25,024
Are you happy now?

295
00:26:25,233 --> 00:26:26,433
You're so mean.

296
00:27:06,654 --> 00:27:08,179
Is that so?

297
00:27:08,684 --> 00:27:12,262
Okay, no problem. Your brother is a new nurse.

298
00:27:12,387 --> 00:27:15,843
Just make sure that he will buy food for your brother.

299
00:27:16,684 --> 00:27:17,684
Okay.

300
00:27:38,232 --> 00:27:39,272
Nessie.

301
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:39,901
when we graduate.

302
00:27:41,774 --> 00:27:43,632
you'll ready be a nurse?

303
00:27:45,485 --> 00:27:46,485
Yes.

304
00:27:47,013 --> 00:27:49,546
I've always wanted to be nurse.

305
00:27:51,563 --> 00:27:54,266
I love taking care of sick people.

306
00:27:56,313 --> 00:28:00,516
I'm taking care of my siblings.

307
00:28:03,083 --> 00:28:04,893
and not just nurses.

308
00:28:06,434 --> 00:28:11,705
I'm one of the best nurses in the Philippines.

309
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:17,370
Do you really need to be good at something?

310
00:28:18,831 --> 00:28:20,031
I'm good at it.

311
00:28:21,799 --> 00:28:25,097
As long as you put your attention to it,

312
00:28:25,592 --> 00:28:29,087
you'll be a good nurse.

313
00:28:29,429 --> 00:28:33,909
That's why you're the one who'll
be on the board as our valedictorian.

314
00:28:34,383 --> 00:28:35,823
That's just a job.

315
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:40,489
Tim,

316
00:28:41,227 --> 00:28:42,907
we have a different plan.

317
00:28:45,776 --> 00:28:47,509
I have a question for you.

318
00:28:48,142 --> 00:28:49,142
What is it?

319
00:28:53,084 --> 00:28:57,848
I hope you'll give me the same
gift as when we graduated.

320
00:28:59,556 --> 00:29:02,026
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

321
00:29:02,886 --> 00:29:04,849
You're so mean.

322
00:29:05,896 --> 00:29:07,576
Don't you notice that.

323
00:29:08,826 --> 00:29:11,423
we've been together for weeks?

324
00:29:11,888 --> 00:29:14,162
Of course, we've classmates.

325
00:29:15,042 --> 00:29:16,042
Why?

326
00:29:16,472 --> 00:29:18,677
Are we just classmates?

327
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:27,952
Oh, so that means...

328
00:29:28,507 --> 00:29:31,417
Yes, it's us!

329
00:29:31,889 --> 00:29:34,058
Yes! You!

330
00:29:34,618 --> 00:29:39,687
I've told you so many times
that yes, you won't understand.

331
00:29:41,527 --> 00:29:43,788
I'm so happy!

332
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,666
Thank you.

333
00:29:47,920 --> 00:29:49,520
You won't regret it.

334
00:29:53,197 --> 00:29:55,305
Ate, you look pitiful.

335
00:29:55,498 --> 00:29:57,385
Let's go, dad's waiting.

336
00:29:58,390 --> 00:30:00,757
Tin told me, he already answered me.

337
00:30:00,933 --> 00:30:02,546
Yes, he really answered you.

338
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,694
Congrats!

339
00:30:03,906 --> 00:30:04,613
Are you okay now?

340
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:06,480
Let's go, dad's waiting.

341
00:30:19,065 --> 00:30:20,018
Hey, Tin.

342
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:22,277
Why do you seem to be walking around?

343
00:30:24,199 --> 00:30:26,799
Nothing.
I'm just thinking about something.

344
00:30:28,765 --> 00:30:32,161
Don't think about it too early, okay?
Make sure you do that.

345
00:30:32,907 --> 00:30:33,907
You're like a bad person.

346
00:30:34,504 --> 00:30:36,104
Okay, I'll go ahead.

347
00:30:36,645 --> 00:30:37,042
What are you doing?

348
00:31:06,554 --> 00:31:08,621
Christina, stop being yourself.

349
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:23,331
You're okay now.

350
00:31:24,743 --> 00:31:26,551
You're fine.

351
00:31:30,006 --> 00:31:36,132
You're happy with Sean.

352
00:31:41,371 --> 00:31:43,277
He loves you.

353
00:31:44,740 --> 00:31:46,382
Don't waste it.

354
00:31:48,042 --> 00:31:49,722
He's been through a lot.

355
00:31:55,014 --> 00:31:56,906
Nessie is gone.

356
00:31:59,991 --> 00:32:02,384
Forgot about Nessie.

357
00:32:03,549 --> 00:32:05,683
Forgot what happened to you two.

358
00:32:07,579 --> 00:32:08,579
Forgot it.

359
00:32:17,016 --> 00:32:19,416
Don't let everything get out of hand.

360
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,130
You can do this, Christina.

361
00:32:30,228 --> 00:32:31,508
You can do this.

362
00:32:35,898 --> 00:32:36,898
Be strong.

363
00:32:51,741 --> 00:32:52,741
Sigh.

364
00:33:00,534 --> 00:33:04,765
I told you I don't need a nurse.

365
00:33:07,914 --> 00:33:11,485
I'm just thinking about everything I do.

366
00:33:11,837 --> 00:33:14,011
It's like I'm in the garden now.

367
00:33:14,111 --> 00:33:15,931
I told you I don't want to.

368
00:33:21,004 --> 00:33:23,804
Just send this home. I don't want a nurse.

369
00:33:31,101 --> 00:33:34,555
I'll go ahead. My sister is waiting.

370
00:33:35,124 --> 00:33:36,405
Okay, just come back.

371
00:33:36,504 --> 00:33:37,224
Yes.

372
00:33:37,338 --> 00:33:41,365
Nessie, I'm done cooking for my brother.

373
00:33:41,464 --> 00:33:44,316
Can you feed him?

374
00:33:44,552 --> 00:33:46,256
Okay, no problem.

375
00:33:46,323 --> 00:33:47,323
Thank you

376
00:33:53,939 --> 00:33:55,619
Hi, Han! How are you?

377
00:33:55,804 --> 00:33:56,364
Hi!

378
00:33:57,664 --> 00:34:00,024
I'm just like the guy in the movie, Presinto.

379
00:34:02,297 --> 00:34:04,612
Everything I do is limited.

380
00:34:06,442 --> 00:34:07,442
Why?

381
00:34:08,324 --> 00:34:10,637
What's wrong with that new nurse?

382
00:34:12,066 --> 00:34:15,537
Every time I don't do what
she wants, she scares me.

383
00:34:15,637 --> 00:34:22,283
She said she's going to call Doc Vince and when
I'm going to be hospitalized, I'll get better.

384
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:24,267
Get rid of her.

385
00:34:26,183 --> 00:34:31,272
If Vince said that the nurse can get rid of you, I can't do anything.

386
00:34:32,321 --> 00:34:33,558
Where's the nurse?

387
00:34:33,789 --> 00:34:35,469
She's there, washing.

388
00:34:37,114 --> 00:34:38,577
Wait, I'll go get her.

389
00:34:38,869 --> 00:34:40,188
Have you eaten?

390
00:34:40,415 --> 00:34:41,415
Not yet.

391
00:34:41,369 --> 00:34:42,369
Wait.

392
00:35:00,453 --> 00:35:03,119
Thank you for taking care of my husband.

393
00:35:06,277 --> 00:35:10,373
It seems like your dream of
becoming a good nurse has come true.

394
00:35:17,192 --> 00:35:20,693
That's my job. You don't need to thank me.

395
00:35:26,420 --> 00:35:27,420
I know.

396
00:35:31,536 --> 00:35:33,736
I was thinking about you all day.

397
00:35:36,824 --> 00:35:40,144
I saw you this morning.

398
00:35:42,759 --> 00:35:45,159
It's like a feeling came to my head.

399
00:35:47,412 --> 00:35:49,812
And all my memories came back to me.

400
00:35:52,582 --> 00:35:55,166
If you have something to say, don't say it.

401
00:35:56,205 --> 00:35:57,202
It's over.

402
00:35:57,606 --> 00:35:59,272
You don't have to come back.

403
00:35:59,936 --> 00:36:00,930
Go ahead.
I know.

404
00:36:01,047 --> 00:36:02,500
I'll Just go to my husband.

405
00:36:14,542 --> 00:36:15,982
Good morning, Ate!

406
00:36:16,023 --> 00:36:18,072
Oh, good morning! You're already home.

407
00:36:18,157 --> 00:36:19,724
Yes, last night.

408
00:36:20,082 --> 00:36:22,118
Nessie opened the door for me.

409
00:36:24,158 --> 00:36:25,711
Ate, you know what?

410
00:36:26,209 --> 00:36:27,771
Nessie seems to be a good person.

411
00:36:27,931 --> 00:36:30,126
She knows how to take care of her brother.

412
00:36:30,127 --> 00:36:32,198
She's not like the other nurses.

413
00:36:32,198 --> 00:36:34,131
And she's so nice to talk to.

414
00:36:34,589 --> 00:36:37,291
She looks kind and not plastic.

415
00:36:37,646 --> 00:36:39,513
And she's so beautiful, Ate.

416
00:36:41,413 --> 00:36:44,989
I'll just go get some coffee.

417
00:36:45,162 --> 00:36:46,761
Okay, just a moment.

418
00:36:55,899 --> 00:36:56,946
Love you.

419
00:36:57,805 --> 00:36:58,845
Love you too.

420
00:37:03,565 --> 00:37:07,277
Sis, it seems like he'll get better soon because of Nessa.

421
00:37:09,641 --> 00:37:11,081
What did you hear?

422
00:37:11,203 --> 00:37:16,389
She said that instead of sending him to the rehab center.

423
00:37:16,398 --> 00:37:20,328
she requested the doc to send him to the therapist.

424
00:37:20,563 --> 00:37:23,425
So that he won't miss his session.

425
00:37:24,481 --> 00:37:29,815
And it's amazing, right?
I'm in love with him.

426
00:37:33,318 --> 00:37:37,898
What are you thinking?
You have a girlfriend, right?

427
00:37:37,984 --> 00:37:41,643
No, I don't. It's just a fling.
And it's been a while since I've been away.

428
00:37:44,694 --> 00:37:46,737
Hurry up. I'll take a bath.

429
00:37:46,768 --> 00:37:48,039
Okay, sis.

430
00:37:59,007 --> 00:38:00,007
Hi, Nessie.

431
00:38:00,879 --> 00:38:02,559
I brought you some food.

432
00:38:02,774 --> 00:38:05,007
I'll be home later.

433
00:38:07,043 --> 00:38:08,770
I didn't know you were a big girl.

434
00:38:08,770 --> 00:38:10,183
It's nothing.

435
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:13,976
I'm just doing my job to
take care of the people here.

436
00:38:15,425 --> 00:38:16,878
Why are you hiding something?

437
00:38:18,196 --> 00:38:19,196
Uh...

438
00:38:20,183 --> 00:38:21,785
Yes, I am.

439
00:38:23,184 --> 00:38:24,184
Let's eat.

440
00:38:38,395 --> 00:38:41,195
Good morning, Sir Sean.
How was your sleep?

441
00:38:42,272 --> 00:38:43,272
You steel here?

442
00:38:44,139 --> 00:38:46,709
Yes. I wont leave until you're better.

443
00:38:50,364 --> 00:38:52,705
Come on, let's eat.

444
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:56,885
I don't want to eat.

445
00:38:56,885 --> 00:38:59,653
And later, your physical therapy
will come for your session.

446
00:39:00,132 --> 00:39:02,457
I don't want to eat.
I don't want to go therapy either.

447
00:39:02,406 --> 00:39:03,687
Don't you understand?

448
00:39:06,791 --> 00:39:13,721
Okay. I'll just put in your report that you can't eat your own.

449
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:19,512
and you need a feeling tube in your stomach to let food pass through.

450
00:39:19,513 --> 00:39:24,285
And I'll also put that you need dextrose so you won't dehydrate.

451
00:39:24,952 --> 00:39:29,784
And I'll call an ambulance to bring you to the hospital for you session.

452
00:39:33,616 --> 00:39:36,800
Just wait, Sir Sean. I'll call the ambulance.

453
00:39:36,823 --> 00:39:42,803
Wait. Don't call. I'll eat.

454
00:39:44,372 --> 00:39:46,454
Oh, you'll eat. But you're mad.

455
00:39:46,820 --> 00:39:49,761
Don't. I'll just call for the feeding tube.

456
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:54,552
It's hard. If you eat, you BP will go up.
And what will happen to you.

457
00:39:57,226 --> 00:39:59,101
Okay, I'll eat.

458
00:40:00,292 --> 00:40:01,972
Bina, bring me there.

459
00:40:07,294 --> 00:40:08,294
Friend?

460
00:40:09,526 --> 00:40:11,206
Let's go. It's lunchtime.

461
00:40:12,024 --> 00:40:13,024
I have a lot to do, Bes.

462
00:40:13,783 --> 00:40:16,378
Oh, you're not that busy, friend.

463
00:40:17,142 --> 00:40:18,142
I'm not.

464
00:40:18,703 --> 00:40:19,823
It's my treat!

465
00:40:21,264 --> 00:40:22,264
Okay. Okay.

466
00:40:23,510 --> 00:40:25,977
I know you won't ask me for anything.

467
00:40:26,060 --> 00:40:27,221
Yes, let's go.

468
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:28,833
I'm free sometimes.

469
00:40:29,833 --> 00:40:30,815
I'm so lazy.

470
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:32,540
Stop!

471
00:40:32,976 --> 00:40:33,836
Hurry!

472
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:34,669
Here it is.

473
00:40:34,789 --> 00:40:35,789
Go.

474
00:40:42,899 --> 00:40:44,865
Nessie, the therapist is here.

475
00:40:44,865 --> 00:40:46,465
Hi, good to see you.

476
00:40:47,049 --> 00:40:48,729
Hello, Pete. Welcome.

477
00:40:49,255 --> 00:40:51,039
She's your patient, Sertian.

478
00:40:51,631 --> 00:40:54,051
Hi, Nessie. Thanks for referring me.

479
00:40:54,514 --> 00:40:56,194
Good afternoon, Sertian.

480
00:40:58,757 --> 00:41:00,557
Where's the treatment area?

481
00:41:01,012 --> 00:41:03,392
It's in Sertian's room-

482
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:06,514
You've read the case about Sertian, right?

483
00:41:06,727 --> 00:41:07,789
Yes, I've read it.

484
00:41:07,789 --> 00:41:09,895
I even know the record.

485
00:41:10,061 --> 00:41:13,739
Okay. He has sessions
before, so you can handle it.

486
00:41:13,826 --> 00:41:15,506
Okay. I'll handle it.

487
00:41:16,172 --> 00:41:18,705
Sertian, let's go. Let's have therapy.

488
00:41:32,506 --> 00:41:34,186
Thank you for the treat.

489
00:41:35,477 --> 00:41:36,477
Welcome.

490
00:41:37,316 --> 00:41:40,388
So, while we're waiting for dessert, let's talk.

491
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:46,900
What's this?

492
00:41:47,383 --> 00:41:49,316
I don't have anything to say.

493
00:41:50,929 --> 00:41:53,432
Miss Christina Aguilar.

494
00:41:53,717 --> 00:41:55,286
I don't like that kind of drama.

495
00:41:56,009 --> 00:41:58,909
I feel like there's something bothering you.

496
00:42:02,171 --> 00:42:03,171
Thank you.

497
00:42:07,699 --> 00:42:08,896
Nessie.

498
00:42:09,726 --> 00:42:10,726
Nessie?

499
00:42:11,426 --> 00:42:12,426
As in,

500
00:42:12,689 --> 00:42:16,313
the beautiful, sexy, and awesome ex-nurse?

501
00:42:16,814 --> 00:42:18,387
The deco-queenery?

502
00:42:18,690 --> 00:42:20,472
I don't like that kind of drama.

503
00:42:21,364 --> 00:42:22,884
She's so beautiful.

504
00:42:23,365 --> 00:42:25,832
I wish the Lord would give her to me.

505
00:42:27,316 --> 00:42:28,300
You're so mean.

506
00:42:28,299 --> 00:42:30,499
You're the one who said I'm ugly.

507
00:42:31,333 --> 00:42:32,373
Sorry, friend.

508
00:42:34,064 --> 00:42:35,064
So,

509
00:42:35,374 --> 00:42:36,894
what's the problem?

510
00:42:39,254 --> 00:42:40,934
She's staying a home.

511
00:42:41,379 --> 00:42:42,979
She's the new nurse.

512
00:42:43,824 --> 00:42:46,053
Oh my gosh.

513
00:42:47,189 --> 00:42:48,911
That's why I'm confused.

514
00:42:49,177 --> 00:42:50,857
I don't know what to do.

515
00:42:51,442 --> 00:42:53,709
But I feel like she's avoiding me.

516
00:42:54,682 --> 00:42:55,682
I know.

517
00:42:55,877 --> 00:42:57,477
She's a sick person.

518
00:42:59,238 --> 00:43:00,638
I know that.

519
00:43:02,021 --> 00:43:03,481
I also know that

520
00:43:03,876 --> 00:43:05,781
I should stop myself.

521
00:43:07,490 --> 00:43:09,012
But, you know,

522
00:43:09,150 --> 00:43:11,283
she came home yesterday morning.

523
00:43:11,969 --> 00:43:13,649
She's not in my mind.

524
00:43:13,669 --> 00:43:16,273
Friend, control yourself.

525
00:43:17,118 --> 00:43:18,798
If she can leave you,

526
00:43:18,823 --> 00:43:20,487
so there won't be any problem.

527
00:43:20,722 --> 00:43:21,722
don't.

528
00:43:25,811 --> 00:43:26,851
You're right.

529
00:43:28,058 --> 00:43:30,204
She's just staying at home for a few days.

530
00:43:30,531 --> 00:43:31,687
Because on weekends,

531
00:43:31,909 --> 00:43:34,248
she'll go home and I'll take care of Shai.

532
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:35,829
That's what I'm saying.

533
00:43:35,991 --> 00:43:37,724
So, if you have a problem.

534
00:43:38,317 --> 00:43:39,651
That's what I'm saying.

535
00:43:41,225 --> 00:43:42,225
Here.

536
00:43:42,345 --> 00:43:43,705
Thank you friend.

537
00:43:44,652 --> 00:43:45,652
Marty,

538
00:43:46,276 --> 00:43:47,655
let's finish the dessert.

539
00:43:47,873 --> 00:43:49,806
Your boss is waiting for you.

540
00:43:50,345 --> 00:43:51,345
One more

541
00:43:56,252 --> 00:43:57,252
Ouch!

542
00:43:57,787 --> 00:43:58,787
Ouch!

543
00:43:58,835 --> 00:43:59,835
Careful.

544
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:00,868
You know what we did?

545
00:44:00,868 --> 00:44:02,041
It hurts.

546
00:44:03,374 --> 00:44:04,494
Just a moment.

547
00:44:04,825 --> 00:44:05,825
Jesse.

548
00:44:06,603 --> 00:44:08,337
It's in the report, right?

549
00:44:08,957 --> 00:44:10,699
The legs are not íet sensitive?

550
00:44:10,985 --> 00:44:11,849
Yes.

551
00:44:12,864 --> 00:44:14,055
So, it means,

552
00:44:14,290 --> 00:44:16,841
the sensation of your legs in coming back?

553
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:18,163
I think so.

554
00:44:18,828 --> 00:44:20,028
It's good news.

555
00:44:21,503 --> 00:44:22,561
Yes, Sir Sean. You heard that.

556
00:44:22,561 --> 00:44:25,902
The feeling of your legs is slowly coming back.

557
00:44:26,257 --> 00:44:29,234
If we continue what we're doing,

558
00:44:29,693 --> 00:44:31,693
I'm sure, in a month,

559
00:44:31,963 --> 00:44:33,643
we'll be able to walk.

560
00:44:34,384 --> 00:44:35,929
I hope so.

561
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:37,742
It's a good news.

562
00:44:38,956 --> 00:44:41,864
Sir, I can feel it but I can't move.

563
00:44:42,084 --> 00:44:43,260
Is that normal?

564
00:44:43,445 --> 00:44:46,725
Don't worry. We'll get there.

565
00:44:47,896 --> 00:44:49,522
Thank you, Sir Pete.

566
00:44:50,475 --> 00:44:54,389
I'll go get our food.

567
00:44:54,801 --> 00:44:55,801
Sir Sean,

568
00:44:55,957 --> 00:44:57,592
after Pete,

569
00:44:57,982 --> 00:45:00,449
I'll go with him. I'll go home first.

570
00:45:00,463 --> 00:45:01,743
Okay. Take care.

571
00:46:19,540 --> 00:46:20,980
Mario, who's that?

572
00:46:21,782 --> 00:46:23,060
Oh, You're home, Ate.

573
00:46:23,060 --> 00:46:25,820
It's Charm, my girlfriend.

574
00:46:25,820 --> 00:46:28,474
Oh, hello. So you're Mario's sister?

575
00:46:28,474 --> 00:46:29,799
No, I'm not.

576
00:46:29,799 --> 00:46:31,059
That's Why, Ate.

577
00:46:31,059 --> 00:46:32,282
I'm his sister.

578
00:46:32,831 --> 00:46:34,135
Sorry about that.

579
00:46:34,136 --> 00:46:36,914
That's how it is, Ate. But it's cool.

580
00:46:38,570 --> 00:46:40,250
So you have a girlfriend.

581
00:46:40,671 --> 00:46:41,987
Why didn't you tell me?

582
00:46:41,987 --> 00:46:44,056
You're next in line.

583
00:46:44,306 --> 00:46:45,293
It's okay, Ate.

584
00:46:45,467 --> 00:46:46,662
Where's Ana?

585
00:46:47,023 --> 00:46:49,537
She's not here yet.
She's probably still on duty.

586
00:46:50,615 --> 00:46:52,484
Oh, maybe she's overtime.

587
00:46:52,484 --> 00:46:54,350
She might be late to change.

588
00:46:55,860 --> 00:46:57,715
Oh, you're here!

589
00:46:57,715 --> 00:47:00,280
Asing! Nesing!

590
00:47:00,578 --> 00:47:01,979
You're so O.A.

591
00:47:02,105 --> 00:47:03,867
I thought you haven't deen her in a while.

592
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:06,067
You know what? I miss your sister.

593
00:47:06,067 --> 00:47:08,833
And at least now, I have
someone here in the Matino family.

594
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:12,246
Who is she?

595
00:47:12,767 --> 00:47:13,929
Oh, Charm.

596
00:47:13,929 --> 00:47:16,432
She's Ana, Ate Nesing's friend.

597
00:47:17,087 --> 00:47:18,572
Charm, my girlfriend.

598
00:47:18,629 --> 00:47:20,193
Good evening.

599
00:47:23,580 --> 00:47:24,390
Hey!

600
00:47:24,531 --> 00:47:25,704
What happened to you?

601
00:47:25,811 --> 00:47:27,338
I thought you were going home.

602
00:47:27,338 --> 00:47:29,947
No, I wasn't.
I wasn't thinking of anything.

603
00:47:30,529 --> 00:47:31,741
Stop that.

604
00:47:31,780 --> 00:47:33,187
You're like kids.

605
00:47:33,442 --> 00:47:34,773
I'm going to my room.

606
00:47:34,976 --> 00:47:37,243
Okay, but Charm and are going out.

607
00:47:37,395 --> 00:47:40,339
Good thing this ugly guy's isn't here anymore.

608
00:47:40,281 --> 00:47:42,031
Ugly handsome?

609
00:47:42,031 --> 00:47:43,031
Right, babe?

610
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:46,418
I don't know about you!

611
00:47:47,723 --> 00:47:48,923
Good job, Tony.

612
00:47:49,262 --> 00:47:50,529
Your prognosis was good.

613
00:47:50,529 --> 00:47:52,696
Big thanks to your two dedicated teams,

614
00:47:52,695 --> 00:47:53,975
Nessie and Pete.

615
00:47:54,873 --> 00:47:57,354
Come to think of it, they
accomplished it in just a month.

616
00:47:58,565 --> 00:48:00,726
Dude, I want to thank you.

617
00:48:00,726 --> 00:48:02,325
If it  wasn't for you,

618
00:48:02,568 --> 00:48:04,503
I wouldn't have met these two guys.

619
00:48:05,439 --> 00:48:07,987
And if I didn't meet them,

620
00:48:08,193 --> 00:48:09,593
this wouldn't have improved.

621
00:48:09,593 --> 00:48:11,692
Dude, thank you.

622
00:48:12,619 --> 00:48:13,756
Nessie is a good person.

623
00:48:13,756 --> 00:48:14,492
She's like a rock.

624
00:48:14,493 --> 00:48:15,747
I'm not going to be able to stand it.

625
00:48:15,747 --> 00:48:16,732
Even if I yell at her,

626
00:48:16,732 --> 00:48:18,244
even if I ask her to leave,

627
00:48:19,882 --> 00:48:21,002
I won't be able to stand it.

628
00:48:21,002 --> 00:48:23,059
I decided to pick her.

629
00:48:23,058 --> 00:48:23,917
Because she's one of the best that we have.

630
00:48:24,080 --> 00:48:24,819
Oh, Doc.

631
00:48:24,979 --> 00:48:26,659
You're embarrassing me.

632
00:48:27,137 --> 00:48:28,817
You're too much, Doc.

633
00:48:29,372 --> 00:48:30,732
She's really good.

634
00:48:31,045 --> 00:48:32,911
Because the previous nurses.

635
00:48:33,272 --> 00:48:36,005
just one yell and they're already crying.

636
00:48:36,203 --> 00:48:38,646
It's really scary to see this crazy person.

637
00:48:38,887 --> 00:48:41,395
But I'm glad that he's now finally tame.

638
00:48:42,064 --> 00:48:42,999
Pete and Nessie,

639
00:48:44,378 --> 00:48:46,411
just continue with the things you do.

640
00:48:46,411 --> 00:48:48,151
Just take care of your brother.

641
00:48:48,151 --> 00:48:49,431
Because for now,

642
00:48:50,075 --> 00:48:52,349
he already has a sensation on both legs.

643
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:53,349
Meaning,

644
00:48:53,593 --> 00:48:55,786
nerves are being revived one by one.

645
00:48:55,786 --> 00:48:56,539
And hopefully,

646
00:48:56,701 --> 00:48:57,687
in two months' time,

647
00:48:57,687 --> 00:49:01,143
he will have motor functions in his lower extremities.

648
00:49:02,715 --> 00:49:04,023
I'll take care of it, Doc.

649
00:49:05,000 --> 00:49:06,934
Seriously, thank you so much.

650
00:49:07,942 --> 00:49:09,478
And thank you both.

651
00:49:09,478 --> 00:49:10,977
And of course, to my wife.

652
00:49:11,095 --> 00:49:12,976
Because if it wasn't for you,

653
00:49:13,100 --> 00:49:14,780
I wouldn't have improved.

654
00:49:16,942 --> 00:49:18,942
Alright.

655
00:49:19,202 --> 00:49:20,755
Bro, we'll go ahead.

656
00:49:20,756 --> 00:49:21,756
Sure.

657
00:49:30,696 --> 00:49:31,875
What's the problem?

658
00:49:34,191 --> 00:49:34,901
Nothing.

659
00:49:35,832 --> 00:49:38,772
I thought there was someone else in the kitchen.

660
00:49:42,314 --> 00:49:42,399
it's just Mina and Nessi.

661
00:49:42,399 --> 00:49:42,545
Yes.

662
00:49:44,271 --> 00:49:47,218
Actually, I've seen them together a few times.

663
00:49:48,187 --> 00:49:51,590
They often talk and laugh.

664
00:49:52,651 --> 00:49:55,280
I think they're getting along.

665
00:49:58,161 --> 00:49:59,601
I just saw it now.

666
00:50:00,578 --> 00:50:02,098
Mina is that happy.

667
00:50:05,222 --> 00:50:07,335
Does that mean Nessi?

668
00:50:10,365 --> 00:50:12,045
Mina is also like that.

669
00:50:15,832 --> 00:50:18,947
You know what, we're so lucky.

670
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:22,898
If it wasn't for Nessi,

671
00:50:25,683 --> 00:50:27,363
I might still be here.

672
00:50:28,936 --> 00:50:30,456
I might be in jail.

673
00:50:31,391 --> 00:50:33,455
Because Nessi, aside from being kind,

674
00:50:35,260 --> 00:50:39,295
He's patient even though I always nag him,

675
00:50:39,294 --> 00:50:40,814
I always fight him.

676
00:50:41,551 --> 00:50:44,805
You're right. Nessi is really good.

677
00:50:47,519 --> 00:50:49,199
Let's go to sleep again.

678
00:51:21,553 --> 00:51:22,553
What?

679
00:51:27,613 --> 00:51:28,613
Oh, wait.

680
00:51:36,345 --> 00:51:38,393
Mira, make me some coffee.

681
00:51:38,393 --> 00:51:42,076
Good morning, sister.
I'll just finish this in a minute,

682
00:51:42,077 --> 00:51:44,977
You can have my coffee first.
I'm in a hurry.

683
00:51:45,719 --> 00:51:47,586
Okay, sister. Just a minute.

684
00:51:52,672 --> 00:51:54,272
Sister, your coffee.

685
00:51:55,451 --> 00:51:58,779
Sister, why is your head so hot?
Do you have a fever?

686
00:51:58,254 --> 00:52:00,855
Don't try to understand me.
Go back to your room.

687
00:52:05,486 --> 00:52:07,286
I'm stressed. I'll go ahead.

688
00:52:07,462 --> 00:52:09,196
I'm hungry. I want to eat.

689
00:52:29,129 --> 00:52:32,452
Nessa, can we talk?

690
00:52:34,132 --> 00:52:36,332
We don't have anything to talk about.

691
00:52:36,690 --> 00:52:38,370
We're both happy now.

692
00:52:39,978 --> 00:52:44,278
I can see that you're happy.

693
00:52:45,388 --> 00:52:47,616
While I'm miserable.

694
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:55,172
Since you came, I stopped myself because
I know it's unfair to you and my husband.

695
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:00,254
But Nessa, I can't pretend anymore.

696
00:53:02,417 --> 00:53:04,259
I still love you.

697
00:53:04,860 --> 00:53:09,020
Christina, it's been a ling time
since I've lost my love for you.

698
00:53:11,062 --> 00:53:14,774
Even the pain that I've been feeling for years, it's gone.

699
00:53:17,414 --> 00:53:20,550
When I found out that your husband is my patient,

700
00:53:22,442 --> 00:53:24,028
I was confused.

701
00:53:24,561 --> 00:53:30,047
But she's I saw you, that's when I said that I'm free.

702
00:53:37,556 --> 00:53:38,556
Why?

703
00:53:41,314 --> 00:53:42,994
Is it because of Mina?

704
00:53:45,019 --> 00:53:47,465
Is that why I'm not in your heart anymore?

705
00:53:49,190 --> 00:53:50,990
What are you talking about?

706
00:53:51,537 --> 00:53:52,977
Even without Mina,

707
00:53:53,374 --> 00:53:55,574
you've been gone for a long time.

708
00:54:01,561 --> 00:54:02,561
I'm sorry.

709
00:54:06,723 --> 00:54:10,326
I know I hurt you a lot back then.

710
00:54:12,373 --> 00:54:15,173
That's why I want to make up with you now.

711
00:54:16,908 --> 00:54:17,908
Please.

712
00:54:22,601 --> 00:54:24,175
It's all over.

713
00:54:25,128 --> 00:54:27,128
Let's stop talking about this.

714
00:54:29,376 --> 00:54:30,976
Just think about it.

715
00:54:31,520 --> 00:54:32,720
Your husband...

716
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:52,247
I know you still love me.

717
00:54:56,664 --> 00:55:03,238
I will do everything to make you mine again.

718
00:55:10,342 --> 00:55:13,624
Sister, this is so happy, just like before.

719
00:55:14,071 --> 00:55:20,111
Yes, it's like we haven't
eaten together for a long time.

720
00:55:20,726 --> 00:55:29,431
You know, I'm sick, I have a lot of things to do,
I have to take care of my family, I'm a housewife.

721
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:32,568
You're so lucky here.

722
00:55:32,854 --> 00:55:35,457
You're so cute.

723
00:55:35,458 --> 00:55:38,989
Mina, get the cake so we can eat it.

724
00:55:38,988 --> 00:55:40,428
Okay, I'll get it.

725
00:55:45,821 --> 00:55:49,274
Wow! It looks so delicious.

726
00:55:50,005 --> 00:55:51,685
It's really delicious.

727
00:55:52,023 --> 00:55:56,042
Because it's favorite among all my favorite friends.

728
00:55:57,060 --> 00:55:58,740
Who's going to eat that?

729
00:56:03,919 --> 00:56:04,919
Uh...

730
00:56:07,577 --> 00:56:10,603
Excuse me, can you get Sir Sian's medicine?

731
00:56:10,602 --> 00:56:12,936
Eat the cake first. it's delicious.

732
00:56:13,266 --> 00:56:15,800
Sorry, I don't like that kind of cake.

733
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,789
You, take it. You finish that.

734
00:56:20,789 --> 00:56:21,789
Okay, sir.

735
00:56:25,192 --> 00:56:26,192
Let's eat.

736
00:56:28,176 --> 00:56:30,551
Try it first. It's delicious.

737
00:56:30,553 --> 00:56:31,553
Okay, okay.

738
00:56:33,377 --> 00:56:35,198
Sir Sean, here's your medicine.

739
00:56:35,199 --> 00:56:37,132
Okay, I'll drink my medicine.

740
00:56:37,935 --> 00:56:40,228
Are you sure you don't want to eat the cake?

741
00:56:41,080 --> 00:56:43,693
I'm avoiding the sweet stuff, Sir Sian.

742
00:56:44,339 --> 00:56:46,019
Why? Are you on a diet?

743
00:56:46,447 --> 00:56:49,314
You don't have to diet.
You're already sexy.

744
00:56:49,429 --> 00:56:51,256
You're still a ball.

745
00:57:02,886 --> 00:57:04,827
Yes, I'll go.

746
00:57:06,611 --> 00:57:08,678
I'll take a bath so I can rest.

747
00:57:10,187 --> 00:57:11,707
Okay, I'll go next.

748
00:57:12,571 --> 00:57:13,691
I'll go ahead.

749
00:59:09,428 --> 00:59:11,452
Yeah!

750
01:00:02,816 --> 01:00:04,683
Justine, what are you doing?

751
01:00:09,179 --> 01:00:11,680
I'm letting you know how much I love you.

752
01:00:12,207 --> 01:00:13,727
Christina, get out.

753
01:00:16,861 --> 01:00:18,719
I don't love you anymore.

754
01:00:21,314 --> 01:00:22,994
You chose your husband.

755
01:00:23,932 --> 01:00:26,044
No one loves you anymore.

756
01:00:27,298 --> 01:00:31,530
So if you don't want to get into
trouble and your husband finds out,

757
01:00:31,932 --> 01:00:32,932
get out.

758
01:00:38,088 --> 01:00:39,768
You're just confusing me.

759
01:00:41,180 --> 01:00:42,180
Alright.

760
01:00:44,290 --> 01:00:45,890
If you're not ready,

761
01:00:47,681 --> 01:00:48,681
I'll wait.

762
01:00:51,890 --> 01:00:53,930
Good night, Miss.

763
01:01:56,342 --> 01:01:57,382
It suits you.

764
01:01:57,457 --> 01:01:58,287
it's beautiful, right?

765
01:01:59,206 --> 01:02:00,367
Where's my gift?

766
01:02:00,367 --> 01:02:01,400
It's not here.

767
01:03:59,108 --> 01:04:01,119
I can't do this.

768
01:04:05,779 --> 01:04:07,646
I'm the one you should love.

769
01:04:19,009 --> 01:04:22,501
I won't allow you to go to someone else.

770
01:04:24,129 --> 01:04:25,864
You're mine.

771
01:04:28,889 --> 01:04:31,738
No one else can love you,

772
01:04:33,866 --> 01:04:36,241
but me.

773
01:05:07,648 --> 01:05:12,347
Why aren't you dressing up?
You'll be late.

774
01:05:14,094 --> 01:05:18,147
I'm not going to school today.
I have a bad feeling.

775
01:05:18,049 --> 01:05:22,039
Oh, is that so? Do you want me
to call Nessie so she can come?

776
01:05:24,109 --> 01:05:26,898
Nessie, come here for a second.

777
01:05:30,682 --> 01:05:31,992
Why, Nina?

778
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:41,827
How are you feeling?

779
01:05:43,289 --> 01:05:45,845
I feel dizzy when I wake up.

780
01:05:46,340 --> 01:05:49,433
I feel a little hot.

781
01:05:50,674 --> 01:05:53,826
When I stand up, I feel dizzy.

782
01:05:54,441 --> 01:05:56,121
Mina, can you get my bag?

783
01:05:56,217 --> 01:05:57,217
Okay, just a moment.

784
01:06:02,407 --> 01:06:03,687
Nice to see you.

785
01:06:07,118 --> 01:06:08,798
Your temperature is fine.

786
01:06:08,847 --> 01:06:12,706
But let's double-check to make sure.

787
01:06:31,657 --> 01:06:33,337
Give me the other hand.

788
01:06:38,475 --> 01:06:39,847
Just relax.

789
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:18,312
I just had my breakfast.

790
01:07:19,874 --> 01:07:21,572
It's better if you eat first.

791
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:27,702
I'm sure you'll feel better after you eat.

792
01:07:41,353 --> 01:07:42,713
How are you Mina?

793
01:07:43,340 --> 01:07:44,739
I'm fine, sir.

794
01:07:45,152 --> 01:07:46,512
Tell me about it.

795
01:07:47,789 --> 01:07:49,855
Tell me about it. Don't be shy.

796
01:07:50,149 --> 01:07:53,842
Because, I mean...

797
01:07:54,095 --> 01:07:55,558
Good morning!

798
01:07:55,558 --> 01:07:57,565
Hey, Doc Vins!

799
01:07:59,918 --> 01:08:02,363
Looks like my patient is in good mood.

800
01:08:02,363 --> 01:08:03,638
Good morning, Doc!

801
01:08:04,819 --> 01:08:06,937
What's up? Did you get lost?

802
01:08:08,409 --> 01:08:10,969
I got lost to see your situation.

803
01:08:12,327 --> 01:08:17,496
You know, I took a leave for three
days and later, we have a family walk.

804
01:08:18,669 --> 01:08:19,669
That's good.

805
01:08:20,963 --> 01:08:26,972
But, I'm happy because
finally, you listened to me.

806
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:29,681
I've been telling you that for a long time.

807
01:08:32,532 --> 01:08:33,532
Good job.

808
01:08:35,156 --> 01:08:39,577
You know, since the accident, I lost my job.

809
01:08:39,577 --> 01:08:42,782
So, Mom scolded me.

810
01:08:49,145 --> 01:08:52,317
Sir Sean, is it okay if I ask?

811
01:08:56,722 --> 01:08:58,210
About this?

812
01:09:00,636 --> 01:09:02,156
What happened here?

813
01:09:04,849 --> 01:09:05,980
Well,

814
01:09:07,854 --> 01:09:09,109
I think

815
01:09:11,037 --> 01:09:14,540
it's better if Doc Vincent tells the story.

816
01:09:15,591 --> 01:09:17,364
Okay, but...

817
01:09:18,723 --> 01:09:21,379
I hope you don't mind.

818
01:09:22,830 --> 01:09:24,430
Before the accident,

819
01:09:25,062 --> 01:09:26,693
I met a girl.

820
01:09:29,036 --> 01:09:31,222
She's beautiful.

821
01:09:31,483 --> 01:09:32,765
Sophisticated.

822
01:09:34,662 --> 01:09:35,942
We met in a bar.

823
01:12:06,558 --> 01:12:07,678
Brother, wait.

824
01:12:09,316 --> 01:12:12,392
I need to drive for Sandra.
It's her last shift.

825
01:12:12,392 --> 01:12:14,366
Can you drive my car?

826
01:12:15,220 --> 01:12:16,220
Sure.

827
01:12:16,514 --> 01:12:19,774
Sure, bro. But I need to follow Cristina.

828
01:12:21,357 --> 01:12:22,357
Perfect.

829
01:12:22,753 --> 01:12:23,793
Please, here.

830
01:12:23,830 --> 01:12:26,677
I'll save on gas.
Let's go.

831
01:12:26,858 --> 01:12:28,298
I'll drive my car.

832
01:12:29,100 --> 01:12:30,461
She didn't get into an accident.

833
01:12:31,924 --> 01:12:33,044
We don't know.

834
01:12:33,393 --> 01:12:36,998
Almira's plan to destroy my car's brakes.

835
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:40,758
That's the story.

836
01:12:40,766 --> 01:12:42,366
It was all my fault.

837
01:12:43,127 --> 01:12:44,327
That's why now,

838
01:12:45,096 --> 01:12:47,633
I'm doing everything in my powers

839
01:12:47,979 --> 01:12:49,786
to help him get back on his feet.

840
01:12:50,473 --> 01:12:52,372
That's why I'm counting on you, Nessie.

841
01:12:52,372 --> 01:12:55,839
So that's why you're so concerned about Sunshine.

842
01:12:58,426 --> 01:12:59,426
Nessie.

843
01:13:00,160 --> 01:13:01,680
don't get me wrong.

844
01:13:03,934 --> 01:13:06,443
I don't blame Doc Vinson for what happened.

845
01:13:08,695 --> 01:13:11,361
He's my best buddy since college, right?

846
01:13:14,437 --> 01:13:16,684
He's always on my side.

847
01:13:18,729 --> 01:13:20,169
That's why I know

848
01:13:21,623 --> 01:13:24,489
that he can't get over his guilty feelings.

849
01:13:27,684 --> 01:13:30,756
Sunshine, did you catch the person who did that?

850
01:13:31,409 --> 01:13:32,409
Yeah.

851
01:13:32,638 --> 01:13:34,318
Thank God, there's CCTV.

852
01:13:35,256 --> 01:13:36,936
And about the guilt part,

853
01:13:37,308 --> 01:13:38,828
Sunshine was right.

854
01:13:39,592 --> 01:13:43,735
But it's slowly fading away
because I can see the improvement

855
01:13:44,338 --> 01:13:45,622
in that brother of yours.

856
01:13:47,005 --> 01:13:48,738
You're the one who's good.

857
01:13:50,312 --> 01:13:51,832
This nurse is good.

858
01:13:52,503 --> 01:13:54,196
That's why you sent her, right?

859
01:13:55,913 --> 01:13:57,646
So don't worry about that.

860
01:13:58,458 --> 01:13:59,498
I'll be fine.

861
01:14:00,720 --> 01:14:03,887
Sorry, Shun.
Let's go eat.

862
01:14:03,888 --> 01:14:05,008
After a while,

863
01:14:05,488 --> 01:14:06,688
you'll be fine.

864
01:14:08,395 --> 01:14:09,970
Then you can go to therapy.

865
01:14:11,124 --> 01:14:12,564
I told you, right?

866
01:14:13,305 --> 01:14:15,038
I'm like a policeman here.

867
01:14:15,455 --> 01:14:17,583
Look at everything I do.

868
01:14:18,790 --> 01:14:20,442
Always on time.

869
01:14:21,897 --> 01:14:22,755
Anyway.

870
01:14:22,755 --> 01:14:23,963
you can eat first.

871
01:14:23,963 --> 01:14:25,818
No, no, no.
I have to go.

872
01:14:25,818 --> 01:14:27,694
Continue doing a good job, Nessie.

873
01:14:27,996 --> 01:14:29,610
Yes, Doc.
Take care of my brother.

874
01:14:29,610 --> 01:14:30,610
Yes, Doc.

875
01:14:30,793 --> 01:14:31,702
I'll go ahead.

876
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:33,381
Thank you, Miss Sita.

877
01:14:35,056 --> 01:14:37,067
See you, guys.
Take care.

878
01:14:37,856 --> 01:14:39,136
How do you feel?

879
01:14:40,731 --> 01:14:42,068
I'm okay.

880
01:14:43,476 --> 01:14:44,476
You know.

881
01:14:44,896 --> 01:14:47,721
Nessie and Pete

882
01:14:49,073 --> 01:14:51,226
are great.
I'm impressed.

883
01:14:52,799 --> 01:14:54,239
Because every day.

884
01:14:55,271 --> 01:14:57,005
I feel like I've improved.

885
01:14:57,994 --> 01:15:00,208
I feel better.

886
01:15:02,067 --> 01:15:04,200
I'm very thankful for those two.

887
01:15:06,903 --> 01:15:08,151
But you know.

888
01:15:13,531 --> 01:15:14,531
I'm happy.

889
01:15:16,934 --> 01:15:17,934
Why?

890
01:15:19,536 --> 01:15:22,202
Because I'll be the one to go back here.

891
01:15:23,424 --> 01:15:24,666
Me too.

892
01:18:59,621 --> 01:19:01,113
You're so pretty.

893
01:19:02,220 --> 01:19:05,856
Mino, make me some coffee.
Okay, Ate. Just a moment.

894
01:19:07,817 --> 01:19:11,145
Just a moment, sweetie pie.
Just make me some coffee.

895
01:19:18,953 --> 01:19:20,131
Sweetie pie?

896
01:19:21,402 --> 01:19:22,877
Why did you call me that?

897
01:19:24,489 --> 01:19:25,489
Is it you?

898
01:19:25,918 --> 01:19:26,958
Sweet, right?

899
01:19:27,735 --> 01:19:29,735
So I can answer your question.

900
01:19:32,195 --> 01:19:33,195
Yes.

901
01:19:33,334 --> 01:19:34,334
Mina and I.

902
01:19:35,953 --> 01:19:37,633
I won't allow it, Miss.

903
01:19:38,815 --> 01:19:40,495
You only love me, right?

904
01:19:41,576 --> 01:19:42,576
You're mine.

905
01:19:43,071 --> 01:19:44,591
There you go again.

906
01:19:46,356 --> 01:19:49,899
I told you, no one loves you anymore.

907
01:19:49,899 --> 01:19:51,899
And it's dead for you.

908
01:19:55,283 --> 01:19:57,362
You chose your husband, right?

909
01:19:58,112 --> 01:19:59,792
So stop being so selfish.

910
01:20:04,436 --> 01:20:06,970
It's just the two of us, Nessie.

911
01:20:07,727 --> 01:20:09,327
Mina is not for you.

912
01:20:12,689 --> 01:20:13,809
I'll fire her.

913
01:20:17,899 --> 01:20:18,899
Okay.

914
01:20:18,992 --> 01:20:20,672
I'll leave with Mina.

915
01:20:21,638 --> 01:20:25,142
I'll be a nurse for your husband.

916
01:20:26,179 --> 01:20:28,816
You'll never see me again.

917
01:20:34,578 --> 01:20:36,258
That's it. Let's eat.

918
01:20:44,620 --> 01:20:46,107
What happened?

919
01:20:46,107 --> 01:20:48,308
She said her head hurts so she went inside.

920
01:20:48,308 --> 01:20:50,575
The coffee's ready. I'll drink it.

921
01:20:52,522 --> 01:20:53,522
It's hot.

922
01:20:55,921 --> 01:20:56,921
Wow!

923
01:20:57,513 --> 01:20:58,513
Han,

924
01:20:59,098 --> 01:21:01,564
Mina is so beautiful. She's so happy.

925
01:21:03,731 --> 01:21:07,371
Of course, I've seen the love of my life.

926
01:21:08,724 --> 01:21:10,004
You're so sweet.

927
01:21:10,647 --> 01:21:12,362
Han, hug me too.

928
01:21:12,362 --> 01:21:14,762
I'm jealous of them. No one hugs me.

929
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:17,739
Hug me, sis.

930
01:21:17,979 --> 01:21:18,979
But Nessie,

931
01:21:19,860 --> 01:21:21,711
don't leave Mina.

932
01:21:23,132 --> 01:21:25,598
She's a good girl.
Don't make her cry.

933
01:21:26,896 --> 01:21:27,896
Sir Sean,

934
01:21:28,149 --> 01:21:30,612
I was lucky to meet Mina.

935
01:21:31,361 --> 01:21:33,895
I thought I wouldn't love her anymore.

936
01:21:35,393 --> 01:21:37,419
I don't know what happened to Mina.

937
01:21:38,315 --> 01:21:40,649
But the ice in my heart is melting.

938
01:21:41,420 --> 01:21:42,420
That's deep.

939
01:21:42,473 --> 01:21:44,806
Of course, you're in my good books.

940
01:21:44,844 --> 01:21:46,774
You've got a kissing personality.

941
01:21:47,054 --> 01:21:49,105
Okay, kiss each other.

942
01:21:49,540 --> 01:21:50,540
Just one.

943
01:21:51,780 --> 01:21:52,780
Okay.

944
01:21:52,887 --> 01:21:54,167
Han, look at me.

945
01:21:55,185 --> 01:21:57,991
What are you doing?
We're still eating.

946
01:22:04,507 --> 01:22:05,594
What's the problem?

947
01:22:05,595 --> 01:22:08,859
I don't know, brother.
He's been like that for days.

948
01:22:09,025 --> 01:22:12,484
He's changed. I don't know why.

949
01:22:12,484 --> 01:22:14,898
Didn't he say he's sick?

950
01:22:14,999 --> 01:22:16,799
Maybe it's because of that.

951
01:22:17,071 --> 01:22:18,071
Really?

952
01:22:18,611 --> 01:22:20,677
But he never tells me anything.

953
01:22:21,803 --> 01:22:24,345
But okay, let me go to him.

954
01:22:24,950 --> 01:22:26,470
You guys eat there.

955
01:22:27,808 --> 01:22:29,335
I'll talk to your sister.

956
01:22:29,335 --> 01:22:30,455
Okay, brother.

957
01:22:34,912 --> 01:22:35,912
Okay, okay.

958
01:22:45,416 --> 01:22:48,194
Han, where are you going?

959
01:22:51,193 --> 01:22:52,233
Are you okay?

960
01:22:54,590 --> 01:22:56,417
Sorry Han, I was just
thinking about a lot of things.

961
01:22:56,758 --> 01:22:58,929
I'll go out for a while to see Luke.

962
01:23:02,624 --> 01:23:05,975
Martin, what's happening to you?

963
01:23:07,361 --> 01:23:10,261
You haven't been able to talk to me for days.

964
01:23:10,450 --> 01:23:12,130
I'm worried about you,

965
01:23:14,527 --> 01:23:16,955
I don't know, Luke.

966
01:23:20,199 --> 01:23:23,527
I know that I'm hurting because of what's happening.

967
01:23:27,353 --> 01:23:32,282
I chose him because
that's what my dad wanted.

968
01:23:35,608 --> 01:23:38,972
But I know that I love Nes.

969
01:23:42,492 --> 01:23:45,948
I forced him to forget everything that happened to us.

970
01:23:46,169 --> 01:23:48,349
I forced him to forget.

971
01:23:50,508 --> 01:23:53,469
And I was happy with him.

972
01:23:57,027 --> 01:23:59,427
Martin, why is this happening to me?

973
01:24:01,783 --> 01:24:07,181
You know Nes, Luke is busy loving her.

974
01:24:09,338 --> 01:24:12,809
But he's moved on from you.

975
01:24:12,809 --> 01:24:15,870
Don't make it hard for yourself.

976
01:24:21,566 --> 01:24:23,375
I'm so sorry.

977
01:24:30,875 --> 01:24:35,872
It's like my heart is about to explode when I see her.

978
01:24:39,323 --> 01:24:44,230
When she's with Mina and I see them happy.

979
01:24:45,973 --> 01:24:49,197
It's like my heart is about to explode when I see Mina.

980
01:24:49,675 --> 01:24:54,659
It's like I want to hurt Mina and
I'm trying to get away from her.

981
01:24:53,935 --> 01:24:55,215
She's so stupid.

982
01:24:58,227 --> 01:25:01,260
But the doesn't Know the truth.

983
01:25:08,682 --> 01:25:11,945
Maybe I'm just stupid to finish all this.

984
01:25:11,999 --> 01:25:15,861
Stupid? That's all you can do.

985
01:25:16,529 --> 01:25:19,592
You're smart. You're smart.

986
01:25:20,290 --> 01:25:21,410
So just do it.

987
01:25:29,813 --> 01:25:31,493
You're not alone, Tete.

988
01:25:32,664 --> 01:25:34,459
I know.

989
01:25:35,466 --> 01:25:39,883
I'm smart but I can't think of
a way to solve my situation.

990
01:25:44,020 --> 01:25:46,861
Why does he always think of me?

991
01:25:46,860 --> 01:25:49,299
He's the only one I think of.

992
01:25:50,139 --> 01:25:52,031
Even when we're tied up together,

993
01:25:52,346 --> 01:25:55,840
he looks at me.

994
01:25:56,777 --> 01:25:59,177
Why did I become abnormal like this?

995
01:25:59,804 --> 01:26:02,474
It hurts so much.

996
01:26:17,542 --> 01:26:21,510
I don't know, Luke. I don't know.

997
01:26:29,603 --> 01:26:31,123
Good news, brother.

998
01:26:31,505 --> 01:26:33,203
We can start your motor rehab.

999
01:26:33,203 --> 01:26:34,723
You can walk again.

1000
01:26:36,813 --> 01:26:38,173
That's good news.

1001
01:26:39,472 --> 01:26:41,872
I feel like I'm getting better.

1002
01:26:42,961 --> 01:26:44,641
It's a bit heavy, but...

1003
01:26:44,860 --> 01:26:47,996
You know, the cold is gone. It's not like before.

1004
01:26:48,565 --> 01:26:50,245
It's normal, brother.

1005
01:26:49,929 --> 01:26:52,829
Even if you feel like you're getting better.

1006
01:26:53,235 --> 01:26:57,082
That means your nerves are back to normal.

1007
01:27:00,093 --> 01:27:01,811
You're back to normal, better.

1008
01:27:02,722 --> 01:27:04,574
Anyway, congrats to both of you.

1009
01:27:04,574 --> 01:27:08,219
Just help your brother, okay?
Don't let him down.

1010
01:27:09,632 --> 01:27:11,632
By the way, where's Christina?

1011
01:27:13,511 --> 01:27:17,797
She's not feeling well,
so she's not coming.

1012
01:27:18,801 --> 01:27:21,471
You know, last night was weird.

1013
01:27:22,212 --> 01:27:26,116
We were eating, and then she
suddenly vomited and walked out.

1014
01:27:28,690 --> 01:27:30,370
Maybe it's just stress.

1015
01:27:30,572 --> 01:27:34,984
You know, even since the accident,
she's the only one moving.

1016
01:27:36,374 --> 01:27:38,707
Maybe she needs to go the hospital.

1017
01:27:40,947 --> 01:27:41,987
You're right.

1018
01:27:43,209 --> 01:27:46,241
Okay, I'll follow your advice.

1019
01:27:46,956 --> 01:27:50,668
Anyway, it looks like a lot of people are waiting outside.

1020
01:27:50,950 --> 01:27:53,375
We'll go ahead.
Yeah, sure.

1021
01:27:54,406 --> 01:27:56,109
Thank you.
Sure, Doc.

1022
01:28:18,714 --> 01:28:21,488
Han, how are you feeling?

1023
01:28:22,102 --> 01:28:23,102
I'm fine.

1024
01:28:25,324 --> 01:28:28,218
Han, I'm sorry about last night.

1025
01:28:28,986 --> 01:28:31,766
I was just thinking about a lot of things at the office.

1026
01:28:32,477 --> 01:28:36,061
There was a problem with
one account and I got involved.

1027
01:28:36,163 --> 01:28:38,474
The manager called us, so I couldn't go.

1028
01:28:39,154 --> 01:28:40,610
It's okay, Han.

1029
01:28:41,188 --> 01:28:42,535
Don't think about it.

1030
01:28:43,548 --> 01:28:47,260
Mina told me that you're not feeling well either.

1031
01:28:49,402 --> 01:28:52,516
By the way, it's weekend tomorrow.

1032
01:28:52,833 --> 01:28:54,833
Do you want to visit your mom?

1033
01:28:56,916 --> 01:28:58,024
Sure.

1034
01:28:58,204 --> 01:29:01,524
It's been a while since I visited my mom.

1035
01:29:02,057 --> 01:29:03,657
And I miss them too.

1036
01:29:05,299 --> 01:29:09,568
I'll call her later and ask if
we can go tomorrow morning.

1037
01:29:10,468 --> 01:29:13,412
We'll just skip it because we're overnighters.

1038
01:29:15,703 --> 01:29:20,586
We can stay there for a few days.
I already filed for leave, so...

1039
01:29:22,155 --> 01:29:24,755
I'll leave the rest of my work to Luke.

1040
01:29:25,489 --> 01:29:27,410
That's a good idea.

1041
01:29:27,704 --> 01:29:32,603
It's better for you to relax and rest.

1042
01:29:34,540 --> 01:29:37,274
Thank you.
Anytime.

1043
01:29:39,956 --> 01:29:44,382
Okay, Han. I'll help you.
Okay, slowly. Okay.

1044
01:29:49,607 --> 01:29:53,927
Be careful when you get home.
Text me when you get home.

1045
01:29:53,926 --> 01:29:55,255
Of course.

1046
01:29:55,497 --> 01:29:56,937
You're like a kid.

1047
01:29:58,523 --> 01:30:00,523
I'll be back on Monday, right?

1048
01:30:00,605 --> 01:30:04,296
It's been two days since I last called you.

1049
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:08,043
Don't worry about that. It's easy.

1050
01:30:08,347 --> 01:30:10,205
Go ahead and rest.

1051
01:30:10,206 --> 01:30:12,053
So you can sleep.

1052
01:30:24,410 --> 01:30:25,801
Paingat ka.

1053
01:31:07,789 --> 01:31:10,033
What are you doing here?

1054
01:31:11,884 --> 01:31:14,619
Can we talk, please?

1055
01:31:16,264 --> 01:31:20,296
I've explained everything to you.
We don't have to talk anymore.

1056
01:31:19,768 --> 01:31:21,264
Right?

1057
01:31:25,167 --> 01:31:28,533
Daisy, please. Let's talk.

1058
01:31:28,678 --> 01:31:30,547
I'm confused.

1059
01:31:31,380 --> 01:31:34,759
I've loved you all my life.

1060
01:31:44,142 --> 01:31:47,642
I've dream of being with you until we grow old.

1061
01:31:47,964 --> 01:31:52,621
But you chose to leave me and hurt me.

1062
01:31:54,104 --> 01:32:00,073
I have no choice but to fight for
my life when you're not around.

1063
01:32:04,072 --> 01:32:14,156
Now that I'm happy, I hope
you're happy for me too.

1064
01:32:16,162 --> 01:32:21,214
So please, go home.

1065
01:32:23,020 --> 01:32:25,281
If you really love me.

1066
01:32:28,403 --> 01:32:33,627
Yes, I love you.
I love you so much.

1067
01:32:37,679 --> 01:32:41,348
My heart is breaking because I love you so much.

1068
01:32:43,410 --> 01:32:46,379
That's why I want to talk to you.

1069
01:32:48,398 --> 01:32:52,455
I realized that you're the one I love.

1070
01:32:53,687 --> 01:32:57,107
I just followed my dad's wishes before he died.

1071
01:33:03,500 --> 01:33:05,849
If you want me to leave Sian,

1072
01:33:08,150 --> 01:33:10,143
Let's be together.

1073
01:33:11,796 --> 01:33:14,607
Even now, even now, we're leaving.

1074
01:33:14,922 --> 01:33:16,725
We might be apart.

1075
01:33:16,842 --> 01:33:19,703
Do you hear what you're, Christina?

1076
01:33:21,294 --> 01:33:25,018
We can't go back to the past.

1077
01:33:26,561 --> 01:33:29,485
Please, go home.

1078
01:33:33,656 --> 01:33:36,631
Give yourself a chance.

1079
01:33:37,855 --> 01:33:40,195
Please, go home.

1080
01:33:45,008 --> 01:33:46,321
Please, go home.

1081
01:33:48,022 --> 01:33:50,022
Christina, what are you doing?

1082
01:33:52,476 --> 01:33:56,471
Go home to your husband.
That's what you should do.

1083
01:34:01,367 --> 01:34:02,878
ST!

1084
01:34:05,585 --> 01:34:07,800
ST!

1085
01:34:28,655 --> 01:34:31,090
I'll leave this to you, Mina.

1086
01:34:31,257 --> 01:34:34,010
We might be gone for three days.

1087
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:40,149
Just tell Nessie that we're not here and
I'll just call her students when we get home.

1088
01:34:40,211 --> 01:34:43,731
Okay, sister. Don't worry. I'll take care of the house.

1089
01:34:43,973 --> 01:34:46,639
Okay. Just call me if you need anything.

1090
01:34:46,841 --> 01:34:49,096
Okay, sister. Take care.

1091
01:35:45,226 --> 01:35:47,608
It's good that you're her, my children.

1092
01:35:47,608 --> 01:35:48,608
How are you?

1093
01:35:49,300 --> 01:35:50,378
Hello, Mother.

1094
01:35:50,378 --> 01:35:52,362
Good to see you.
Good to see you, Mother.

1095
01:35:52,362 --> 01:35:53,362
Yes.

1096
01:35:53,573 --> 01:35:54,573
How are you?

1097
01:35:54,987 --> 01:35:57,654
It's good that you're here, my children.

1098
01:35:57,611 --> 01:35:58,161
Yes.

1099
01:35:58,161 --> 01:36:01,027
I'm doing well, Mother. I'm getting better.

1100
01:36:01,293 --> 01:36:05,286
And Doc Vince said that I'm almost ready to go.

1101
01:36:05,515 --> 01:36:07,781
Thank you so much.
You can go now.

1102
01:36:08,656 --> 01:36:11,984
Sir, can you get the things for the car?
Yes, Mother.

1103
01:36:11,011 --> 01:36:12,213
Just put it on the back.

1104
01:36:12,703 --> 01:36:13,212
Okay.

1105
01:36:14,365 --> 01:36:18,230
Oh, I forgot your medicines.

1106
01:36:18,752 --> 01:36:21,711
We bought them here.
I think you have a prescription there.

1107
01:36:21,910 --> 01:36:22,910
Yes.

1108
01:36:22,696 --> 01:36:24,085
It's still far to get there.

1109
01:36:24,892 --> 01:36:25,901
Yes.

1110
01:36:25,732 --> 01:36:29,001
It's okay. But you wasted your medicines at home.

1111
01:36:29,406 --> 01:36:34,914
And the instruction on the exercise that you need to do on your feet.

1112
01:36:36,191 --> 01:36:39,389
Yes. That exercise is important.

1113
01:36:40,277 --> 01:36:43,528
Okay. Just come back soon.
And be careful.

1114
01:36:44,712 --> 01:36:45,920
Yes. Okay, Mother.

1115
01:36:45,400 --> 01:36:46,171
Take care.

1116
01:36:46,171 --> 01:36:48,199
So that I won't be late on the road.
Okay.

1117
01:36:49,933 --> 01:36:50,933
Okay.

1118
01:36:54,840 --> 01:36:57,240
Let's eat, Mother.
What did you cook?

1119
01:36:58,080 --> 01:36:58,723
I'm hungry.

1120
01:36:58,723 --> 01:37:01,604
There's a lot. There's a lot of food.

1121
01:37:33,552 --> 01:37:34,992
Why are your here?

1122
01:37:36,050 --> 01:37:38,231
I thought you were there for a long time.

1123
01:37:39,941 --> 01:37:43,549
We forgot to get your brother his medicine.

1124
01:37:43,982 --> 01:37:46,767
I came back because of his exercise.

1125
01:37:46,891 --> 01:37:52,206
Is that so? I was going to ask
you before you left but I forgot.

1126
01:37:53,800 --> 01:37:55,080
It's okay, Mina.

1127
01:37:58,931 --> 01:38:03,358
Can you make me a cup of
coffee while I get my medicine?

1128
01:38:03,649 --> 01:38:05,832
It's okay, Mina.
Just a minute.

1129
01:38:47,182 --> 01:38:48,382
Who texted you?

1130
01:38:51,203 --> 01:38:54,619
My patient's family.

1131
01:38:56,812 --> 01:38:58,012
You're so ugly.

1132
01:38:58,251 --> 01:38:59,984
You must have a love life.

1133
01:39:00,131 --> 01:39:01,571
What did they say?

1134
01:39:03,762 --> 01:39:05,122
It's a love life.

1135
01:39:06,101 --> 01:39:08,712
They're just sharing a room.

1136
01:39:09,512 --> 01:39:12,655
My patient went home to the province.

1137
01:39:13,990 --> 01:39:15,204
Then, join them.

1138
01:39:15,204 --> 01:39:16,244
I'll get one.

1139
01:39:16,958 --> 01:39:18,638
I'll get one for you.

1140
01:39:18,892 --> 01:39:20,562
So you'll be sure. It's already late.

1141
01:39:20,562 --> 01:39:21,562
Get one?

1142
01:39:21,802 --> 01:39:25,267
You have a date with a charming girl?

1143
01:39:25,799 --> 01:39:26,799
We don't.

1144
01:39:27,157 --> 01:39:28,957
What if she's a bad person?

1145
01:39:28,755 --> 01:39:30,960
You're ugly and jealous.

1146
01:39:30,960 --> 01:39:31,960
Hey!

1147
01:39:31,704 --> 01:39:34,249
She's just insecure because I'm pretty.

1148
01:39:34,249 --> 01:39:35,249
Insecure?

1149
01:39:35,294 --> 01:39:36,024
What?

1150
01:39:36,024 --> 01:39:37,385
You're pretty?
Let me see.

1151
01:39:39,242 --> 01:39:40,557
Okay, fine.

1152
01:39:43,039 --> 01:39:45,145
When you two stop,

1153
01:39:46,364 --> 01:39:48,383
you'll both get one.

1154
01:40:23,257 --> 01:40:24,742
What's this?

1155
01:40:25,367 --> 01:40:26,367
Sis.

1156
01:40:28,261 --> 01:40:31,123
Sis, what's this?
Why am I tied up?

1157
01:40:32,967 --> 01:40:34,399
You're awake.

1158
01:40:46,232 --> 01:40:47,748
I'm sorry, Mina.

1159
01:40:52,075 --> 01:40:54,141
You were wrong to love someone.

1160
01:40:56,554 --> 01:41:05,540
You're kind, but you're too stubborn.

1161
01:41:05,637 --> 01:41:08,842
What are you saying, Ate?

1162
01:41:12,881 --> 01:41:15,081
Do you think I'll just let it go?

1163
01:41:17,174 --> 01:41:19,241
Of course not.

1164
01:41:19,859 --> 01:41:22,791
I don't understand what you're saying.

1165
01:42:28,824 --> 01:42:31,812
I'm so scared of you.

1166
01:42:31,845 --> 01:42:33,704
why are you like this?

1167
01:42:33,776 --> 01:42:35,776
I'm the one who's scared of you.

1168
01:42:41,925 --> 01:42:43,365
you're not the one

1169
01:42:45,598 --> 01:42:46,598
I'm the one

1170
01:42:48,221 --> 01:42:50,154
who's the one I love the most

1171
01:42:53,325 --> 01:42:54,925
what are you saying?

1172
01:42:55,691 --> 01:42:56,691
I'm the one

1173
01:42:57,674 --> 01:42:59,607
who's the one I love the most

1174
01:43:07,458 --> 01:43:09,406
you heard it right

1175
01:43:11,888 --> 01:43:13,299
I love Nesi

1176
01:43:15,800 --> 01:43:17,923
she's mine

1177
01:43:22,157 --> 01:43:24,357
before we got married you brother

1178
01:43:25,622 --> 01:43:29,236
Nesi and I fell in love

1179
01:43:35,467 --> 01:43:37,700
But because of you

1180
01:43:43,651 --> 01:43:45,550
the one I love

1181
01:43:45,828 --> 01:43:48,301
is leaving me

1182
01:43:51,751 --> 01:43:53,684
do you know what you deserve?

1183
01:43:56,463 --> 01:43:57,463
your brother

1184
01:44:00,285 --> 01:44:03,085
you should be gone

1185
01:44:06,568 --> 01:44:07,608
and disappear

1186
01:44:09,293 --> 01:44:11,420
so Nesi can come back to me

1187
01:44:22,431 --> 01:44:23,989
sister

1188
01:45:24,106 --> 01:45:31,956
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

1189
01:45:53,363 --> 01:45:55,419
Brother!

1190
01:46:01,546 --> 01:46:03,472
Brother!

1191
01:46:14,616 --> 01:46:16,539
MINA!

1192
01:46:19,932 --> 01:46:20,932
MINA!

1193
01:46:22,689 --> 01:46:24,691
MINA!

1194
01:46:27,135 --> 01:46:28,877
MINA!

1195
01:46:29,987 --> 01:46:31,451
MARIO!

1196
01:46:33,775 --> 01:46:35,965
Come here, I'll call for help!

1197
01:46:35,965 --> 01:46:36,965
Yes, Ate.

1198
01:46:36,995 --> 01:46:39,226
Anna, don't leave Ate!

1199
01:46:39,955 --> 01:46:41,848
MINA!

1200
01:46:43,579 --> 01:46:46,298
MINA, I miss you!

1201
01:46:47,348 --> 01:46:51,517
MINA, I miss you!

1202
01:46:52,571 --> 01:46:54,718
Anna, I miss you!

1203
01:47:03,048 --> 01:47:04,564
MINA!

1204
01:47:15,747 --> 01:47:17,525
I miss you, MINA!

1205
01:47:17,730 --> 01:47:18,730
MARIO!

1206
01:47:21,170 --> 01:47:22,170
MINA!

1207
01:47:35,980 --> 01:47:39,007
Christina!

1208
01:47:41,134 --> 01:47:43,096
Christina!

1209
01:47:43,881 --> 01:47:44,881
MARIO!

1210
01:47:44,993 --> 01:47:45,993
Come here!

1211
01:47:46,030 --> 01:47:47,390
Please, come out!

1212
01:47:47,623 --> 01:47:49,303
I don't want to see you!

1213
01:47:50,594 --> 01:47:51,954
Please, come out!

1214
01:47:52,315 --> 01:47:53,995
I'll bring them here!

1215
01:47:58,677 --> 01:47:59,677
Mario,

1216
01:47:59,840 --> 01:48:02,548
Christina can't die!

1217
01:48:07,126 --> 01:48:09,097
Christina!

1218
01:48:22,535 --> 01:48:23,535
Christina!

1219
01:48:42,585 --> 01:48:47,361
Forgive me for being a
part of what happened.

1220
01:48:48,840 --> 01:48:56,285
I didn't protect you.
I didn't give you good news.

1221
01:49:00,640 --> 01:49:08,115
Forgive me for not telling
you about me and Christina.

1222
01:49:17,666 --> 01:49:21,886
I was afraid of what you might think.

1223
01:49:24,992 --> 01:49:27,192
I was afraid that you'd leave me.

1224
01:49:28,771 --> 01:49:32,501
Because I just gave you this.

1225
01:49:34,977 --> 01:49:36,657
It's not mine anymore.

1226
01:49:40,784 --> 01:49:44,935
My vow to Christina is over.

1227
01:49:51,860 --> 01:49:52,860
I wish...

1228
01:49:54,895 --> 01:49:57,802
I wish I was brave.

1229
01:49:59,677 --> 01:50:03,244
I wish you were here with me.

1230
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:09,848
Nina, I love you.

1231
01:50:12,797 --> 01:50:16,504
Forgive me, Nina. Forgive me.

1232
01:50:43,692 --> 01:50:44,692
Nessie.

1233
01:50:47,611 --> 01:50:48,731
wait a minute.

1234
01:50:50,711 --> 01:50:51,711
Can we talk?

1235
01:50:54,781 --> 01:50:58,557
I don't know what to do with
all that's happening, Session.

1236
01:51:00,875 --> 01:51:02,792
You don't have to worry about anything.

1237
01:51:07,689 --> 01:51:12,555
The day Christina came back
to Manila to get my medicine.

1238
01:51:17,016 --> 01:51:19,809
I knew something bad would happen.

1239
01:51:25,223 --> 01:51:27,374
Because I saw the medicine in my bag.

1240
01:51:35,247 --> 01:51:37,550
I have something to show you in the video.

1241
01:51:57,275 --> 01:51:58,866
Hi, Han.

1242
01:52:02,744 --> 01:52:06,837
I know you're wondering why I have this video in my email.

1243
01:52:12,878 --> 01:52:15,163
I just want to explain.

1244
01:52:22,427 --> 01:52:25,435
Han, let's start by getting to know each other.

1245
01:52:29,633 --> 01:52:36,053
I know, I know you feel that
there's something different about me.

1246
01:52:43,276 --> 01:52:45,080
I'm different.

1247
01:52:51,148 --> 01:52:53,923
I'm just like Mina and Nessie.

1248
01:52:55,069 --> 01:52:56,968
I'm a lesbian.

1249
01:52:59,666 --> 01:53:04,811
My parents know that but
they don't accept my identity.

1250
01:53:06,572 --> 01:53:08,602
Even my siblings.

1251
01:53:11,620 --> 01:53:15,101
They forced me to hide the truth.

1252
01:53:16,223 --> 01:53:21,639
Because they're ashamed in
front of the church and our friends.

1253
01:53:23,884 --> 01:53:27,047
Only a few of my friends know about it.

1254
01:53:29,412 --> 01:53:30,412
It's hard.

1255
01:53:32,274 --> 01:53:35,003
But because my dad is sick,

1256
01:53:36,638 --> 01:53:38,874
I just endured it.

1257
01:53:42,918 --> 01:53:44,962
Before we got married,

1258
01:53:46,775 --> 01:53:49,757
I had a relationship with a woman.

1259
01:53:52,116 --> 01:53:55,259
She's the one I love the most.

1260
01:53:57,773 --> 01:54:00,573
I told you that she's just my best friend.

1261
01:54:03,169 --> 01:54:04,689
Her name is Nessie.

1262
01:54:11,186 --> 01:54:17,140
The truth is, he's the only person I've ever loved.

1263
01:54:19,830 --> 01:54:24,793
And even though it hurts me to have my dad's approval,

1264
01:54:26,606 --> 01:54:31,282
I separated him so I could marry you.

1265
01:54:34,454 --> 01:54:40,865
I know I hurt him a lot, but I had no choice.

1266
01:54:43,221 --> 01:54:45,530
I became weak and fragile.

1267
01:54:50,237 --> 01:54:52,903
Don't think that I don't love you, Sean.

1268
01:54:54,849 --> 01:55:01,762
If I were a normal woman, you're the only man I could love.

1269
01:55:05,620 --> 01:55:09,407
I loved you and I know you'll feel the same.

1270
01:55:11,286 --> 01:55:13,897
I was just kidding.

1271
01:55:16,707 --> 01:55:19,018
Because of your sit-up,

1272
01:55:21,458 --> 01:55:23,755
our life became a mess.

1273
01:55:24,312 --> 01:55:26,918
After more that a year,

1274
01:55:29,970 --> 01:55:35,704
I thought I was a normal woman.

1275
01:55:37,477 --> 01:55:38,757
But I was wrong.

1276
01:55:41,293 --> 01:55:42,857
When I saw him,

1277
01:55:44,664 --> 01:55:50,298
I felt like I was alive because
I was sleeping for a long time.

1278
01:55:51,102 --> 01:55:52,893
I fought hard,

1279
01:55:54,467 --> 01:55:56,674
but it was hard.

1280
01:55:58,546 --> 01:56:03,046
It's hard when you fight against your feelings.

1281
01:56:04,592 --> 01:56:07,094
I get hurt whenever I see him.

1282
01:56:09,780 --> 01:56:13,492
Especially when I see Mina
and her friends getting better.

1283
01:56:16,460 --> 01:56:18,089
My heart aches,

1284
01:56:18,609 --> 01:56:21,337
I feel heavy and angry.

1285
01:56:23,901 --> 01:56:26,553
I don't know myself anymore.

1286
01:56:29,214 --> 01:56:30,814
When you watch this,

1287
01:56:33,249 --> 01:56:34,929
you won't see me anymore.

1288
01:56:40,455 --> 01:56:42,732
I will scare Mina now,

1289
01:56:43,289 --> 01:56:45,089
I will get close to Nessie,

1290
01:56:47,516 --> 01:56:49,155
and I will take her far away,

1291
01:56:49,344 --> 01:56:50,835
when no one knows us.

1292
01:56:51,205 --> 01:56:53,245
And I will do everything

1293
01:56:55,948 --> 01:56:57,920
to make her fall in love again.

1294
01:56:57,920 --> 01:57:00,453
I know that I will do something crazy.

1295
01:57:03,199 --> 01:57:06,207
but I don't want to be a burden to her anymore.

1296
01:57:08,020 --> 01:57:09,887
But I can't take it anymore.

1297
01:57:09,973 --> 01:57:11,173
My heart aches.

1298
01:57:14,970 --> 01:57:17,156
For give me, my love.

1299
01:57:18,614 --> 01:57:21,648
Don't let yourself go.

1300
01:57:22,913 --> 01:57:24,663
and get better.

1301
01:57:27,674 --> 01:57:29,194
You're still young.

1302
01:57:30,515 --> 01:57:33,422
and you're looking for a woman

1303
01:57:35,005 --> 01:57:37,062
who will give you her whole being.

1304
01:57:38,930 --> 01:57:42,840
I'm sure that you will find someone else,

1305
01:57:43,492 --> 01:57:46,024
because you're a good person.

1306
01:57:50,831 --> 01:57:53,004
Thank you so much, my love,

1307
01:57:53,619 --> 01:57:54,739
for loving me,

1308
01:57:56,223 --> 01:57:57,903
for taking care of me,

1309
01:57:57,820 --> 01:57:59,500
for understanding me.

1310
01:58:02,274 --> 01:58:04,435
I hope you will forgive me.

1311
01:58:06,183 --> 01:58:08,046
I love you so much.

1312
01:58:24,248 --> 01:58:26,473
I guess I understand what you're going through.

1313
01:58:33,928 --> 01:58:36,595
I should be the one laughing at you two.

1314
01:58:43,081 --> 01:58:51,663
Because of me...
Because of me...

1315
01:59:00,686 --> 01:59:02,366
she lost her Christian.

1316
01:59:10,128 --> 01:59:15,462
I like it when she's not happy.

1317
01:59:21,782 --> 01:59:24,045
I'm sorry, I'm hurting you.

1318
01:59:25,504 --> 01:59:28,252
I'm really sorry.

1319
01:59:54,684 --> 01:59:57,176
Thank you, Sir Sean.

1320
02:00:06,680 --> 02:00:10,851
Sir Sean, come with me.
Let's light a candle.

1321
02:01:39,079 --> 02:01:46,540
I had all the pain in my heart.

1322
02:01:54,948 --> 02:02:02,568
But I let myself, I let myself drown in tears.

1323
02:02:16,442 --> 02:02:18,230
I let myself.

1324
02:02:25,016 --> 02:02:27,192
I'll just accept it.

1325
02:02:41,608 --> 02:02:43,457
You're free.

1326
02:02:47,483 --> 02:02:48,483
You're free.

1327
02:03:23,992 --> 02:03:25,079
Are you ready, hon?

1328
02:03:48,281 --> 02:03:49,641
You're not alone.
