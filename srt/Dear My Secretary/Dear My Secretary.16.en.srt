1
00:01:05,128 --> 00:01:08,676
If Thee doesn't break up with you,
he will cut ties with Thee.

2
00:01:08,676 --> 00:01:10,121
Cutting ties?

3
00:01:10,121 --> 00:01:13,530
I never wanted to break up with you.

4
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,677
I miss you every day.

5
00:01:15,677 --> 00:01:17,724
I miss you so much!

6
00:01:17,724 --> 00:01:20,329
I'd like to leave the family, Grandpa.

7
00:01:20,329 --> 00:01:22,399
I just want to be with the woman I love.

8
00:01:22,399 --> 00:01:24,214
Thanks for bringing me here.

9
00:01:24,741 --> 00:01:26,267
I really like you.

10
00:01:27,729 --> 00:01:29,712
Please don't force yourself for me.

11
00:01:29,712 --> 00:01:31,814
Go live the life you want to live.

12
00:01:31,814 --> 00:01:33,909
Someone as stingy as me…

13
00:01:33,909 --> 00:01:35,353
can't date anyone.

14
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:37,608
Will you marry me?

15
00:01:37,608 --> 00:01:40,312
So, you're really going to
take this cat home, right?

16
00:01:40,312 --> 00:01:41,312
Sure.

17
00:02:02,800 --> 00:02:04,095
Let me ask you something.

18
00:02:04,628 --> 00:02:06,907
Earlier, you were worried
that I would be in trouble,

19
00:02:06,907 --> 00:02:08,292
and you were breaking up with me.

20
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:11,180
Why did you suddenly change your mind?

21
00:02:13,199 --> 00:02:14,828
Because of what my dad said.

22
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,727
What are you doing?

23
00:02:37,727 --> 00:02:39,509
Well, hanging the laundry?

24
00:02:41,212 --> 00:02:42,864
Hey, what are you standing there for?

25
00:02:45,085 --> 00:02:46,464
You're hugging a doll?

26
00:02:46,464 --> 00:02:48,398
You're thinking of the person
who gave it to you?

27
00:02:49,891 --> 00:02:50,891
Hey.

28
00:02:51,723 --> 00:02:53,660
So, you really love him, don't you?

29
00:02:54,467 --> 00:02:56,409
Look. If you love him that much,

30
00:02:57,075 --> 00:02:58,964
then go back and be with him.

31
00:02:58,964 --> 00:03:00,494
Just get back together and live with him.

32
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:02,141
Why are you standing here hugging a doll?

33
00:03:03,615 --> 00:03:05,848
Can I really be with him?

34
00:03:06,772 --> 00:03:09,214
What about his career?

35
00:03:09,767 --> 00:03:11,429
And then there's his family.

36
00:03:12,282 --> 00:03:13,808
What will others think?

37
00:03:15,190 --> 00:03:16,287
Are you overthinking it?

38
00:03:18,643 --> 00:03:19,643
You know?

39
00:03:20,619 --> 00:03:22,048
When your mother was seriously ill,

40
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:23,969
what did I think about?

41
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,153
- What did you think about?
- I wasn't thinking about anything.

42
00:03:28,806 --> 00:03:30,207
What I once thought about…

43
00:03:30,947 --> 00:03:32,794
Whether I'd continue to play music.

44
00:03:32,794 --> 00:03:34,260
Whether I'd form a new band or play solo.

45
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,890
What songs should I play,

46
00:03:35,890 --> 00:03:37,043
who would be the prime minister,

47
00:03:37,043 --> 00:03:38,154
how much gold would go up,

48
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:39,976
how many points the stock market would drop,

49
00:03:39,976 --> 00:03:41,735
how our neighbors would view us,

50
00:03:41,735 --> 00:03:43,410
everything I used to think

51
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:46,559
all disappeared in the blink of an eye
when Mom got sick.

52
00:03:47,785 --> 00:03:48,886
Because all those things

53
00:03:49,593 --> 00:03:51,368
don't really matter to us.

54
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:58,704
The ones we love, the ones who love us,

55
00:04:00,272 --> 00:04:01,634
that's the most important thing.

56
00:04:05,899 --> 00:04:07,121
I made a mistake…

57
00:04:09,734 --> 00:04:12,429
by not spending enough time with your mom.

58
00:04:15,432 --> 00:04:17,769
I don't want you to make the same mistake.

59
00:04:23,071 --> 00:04:24,071
Okay?

60
00:04:28,754 --> 00:04:30,965
When you weren't around,

61
00:04:30,965 --> 00:04:34,189
I withered like
someone about to run out of water.

62
00:04:34,189 --> 00:04:36,255
That's why I don't want to lose you anymore.

63
00:04:39,677 --> 00:04:41,311
From now on,

64
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:44,608
I will be the one
who makes your heart feel refreshed.

65
00:04:46,272 --> 00:04:47,272
Yeah.

66
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:55,018
So, how did it go, future son-in-law?

67
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,698
Did you succeed in proposing?

68
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:02,440
Perfect!

69
00:05:02,440 --> 00:05:04,861
Yay, Prim is going to have a husband!

70
00:05:04,861 --> 00:05:07,528
Dad! Dad, Dad, keep it down!

71
00:05:10,280 --> 00:05:11,395
Are you ready?

72
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:13,075
I've prepared the room for you.

73
00:05:13,075 --> 00:05:16,005
You can sleep here tonight.

74
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:18,293
What? Sleep here?

75
00:05:18,293 --> 00:05:19,595
Why?

76
00:05:19,595 --> 00:05:21,244
You asked me to marry you,

77
00:05:21,244 --> 00:05:23,125
so you have to take responsibility.

78
00:05:23,125 --> 00:05:26,002
You said you would
take care of this cat, wouldn't you?

79
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:27,928
This one.

80
00:05:27,928 --> 00:05:30,490
Meow, meow.

81
00:05:31,558 --> 00:05:34,260
Why aren't you going back to your house?

82
00:05:34,260 --> 00:05:35,708
Well, I've left my house,

83
00:05:35,708 --> 00:05:36,870
and I've quit my job too.

84
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,385
Right now, I have nowhere to go.

85
00:05:38,385 --> 00:05:39,672
Before I can stand on my own two feet,

86
00:05:39,672 --> 00:05:41,387
I'll probably have to stay at your place.

87
00:05:41,387 --> 00:05:42,728
You're exaggerating!

88
00:05:42,728 --> 00:05:45,297
And in what role
will you be staying here, Boss?

89
00:05:46,598 --> 00:05:47,905
As your future husband!

90
00:05:48,924 --> 00:05:50,637
No, it's inappropriate.

91
00:05:51,699 --> 00:05:53,388
Come on, I don't mind.

92
00:05:54,785 --> 00:05:56,204
Don't overthink it.

93
00:05:56,204 --> 00:05:58,404
One day, we'll be a family anyway.

94
00:05:59,545 --> 00:06:00,699
Wait a minute,

95
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:03,029
Shouldn't I be the one who says that?

96
00:06:03,616 --> 00:06:06,300
Well, if you think it's inappropriate for me

97
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:09,100
to sleep at your house as your future husband,

98
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,127
it's fine.

99
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:13,424
I can sleep here as…
your future son-in-law instead, right?

100
00:06:13,424 --> 00:06:14,460
My future father-in-law?

101
00:06:14,460 --> 00:06:15,557
Sure thing.

102
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:16,749
Perfect!

103
00:06:16,749 --> 00:06:18,726
- What?
- What's the "what"?

104
00:06:18,726 --> 00:06:20,672
Look, don't play hard to get.

105
00:06:20,672 --> 00:06:21,992
It's the modern age now.

106
00:06:21,992 --> 00:06:24,478
Come on, come here. Come, now.

107
00:06:24,478 --> 00:06:25,789
Come in quickly.

108
00:06:42,344 --> 00:06:44,024
- Shall we go inside the house?
- Let's go.

109
00:06:51,445 --> 00:06:52,445
How's the shirt?

110
00:06:53,111 --> 00:06:54,598
- Does it fit?
- It looks great.

111
00:06:55,469 --> 00:06:56,475
This is Sarong.

112
00:06:57,455 --> 00:06:59,603
- Is this the same band?
- Of course, it is.

113
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,903
Aren't we going to eat?

114
00:07:08,629 --> 00:07:11,624
Make yourself comfortable.
Just like this is your place.

115
00:07:12,137 --> 00:07:15,070
Well, this is already our house?

116
00:07:17,682 --> 00:07:20,197
Today, Mr. Wee-Woo looks just like grandpa.

117
00:07:21,134 --> 00:07:24,909
These are my clothes.
The future son-in-law didn't bring any clothes.

118
00:07:24,909 --> 00:07:28,164
Wow, future son-in-law, huh?

119
00:07:28,164 --> 00:07:31,590
Wow, Dad, that was surprisingly easy.

120
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:33,635
Why were you so uptight before?

121
00:07:34,289 --> 00:07:36,402
I have to play hard to get, just for show.

122
00:07:36,402 --> 00:07:39,773
So we have a story to tell the grandkids
about how cool the father-in-law is.

123
00:07:41,393 --> 00:07:42,926
Because if you play too hard to get,

124
00:07:43,506 --> 00:07:45,400
Prim won't have a husband.

125
00:07:46,336 --> 00:07:47,420
Oh, Dad!

126
00:07:47,420 --> 00:07:49,604
Don't say "hmm" like that.

127
00:07:49,604 --> 00:07:51,832
You're not any easier than Dad, sister!

128
00:07:51,832 --> 00:07:53,862
I'm just worried about Prim.

129
00:07:53,862 --> 00:07:56,480
I'm afraid she won't have a husband
like Dad was worried about.

130
00:08:01,044 --> 00:08:04,158
So, did you really quit your job?

131
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:05,504
For sure.

132
00:08:05,504 --> 00:08:07,905
And the company won't have any issues?

133
00:08:08,818 --> 00:08:11,888
There won't be any.
Even if there are, they're not my problem,

134
00:08:11,888 --> 00:08:13,423
they're other people's problems.

135
00:08:14,337 --> 00:08:15,437
It's touching!

136
00:08:16,058 --> 00:08:17,911
I really like that!

137
00:08:18,851 --> 00:08:21,294
Don't be surprised. My dad has bad hearing.

138
00:08:21,294 --> 00:08:22,885
What is Phu Kadeung?

139
00:08:22,885 --> 00:08:23,964
Bad hearing, Dad!!

140
00:08:23,964 --> 00:08:25,781
Oh, yeah? I think it's Phu Kadeung.

141
00:08:25,781 --> 00:08:27,288
He's going to Phu Kadeung, huh?

142
00:08:32,973 --> 00:08:34,362
- I already ate that.
- Come on.

143
00:08:39,453 --> 00:08:40,859
What did you say?

144
00:08:40,859 --> 00:08:43,941
The American partner who was supposed to
collaborate with us on the amusement park

145
00:08:43,941 --> 00:08:45,567
wants to pull out their investment?

146
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:48,533
Yes, Father.

147
00:08:48,533 --> 00:08:50,075
Since Thee left,

148
00:08:50,075 --> 00:08:56,029
there's been uncertainty about
whether the new president is talented enough.

149
00:08:56,029 --> 00:08:59,516
And can he deliver
the results that Thee had promised?

150
00:09:00,096 --> 00:09:03,295
Is Thee the only talented one
in the whole family?

151
00:09:05,406 --> 00:09:07,260
No, no, no. It's no good.

152
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:10,343
This is going to result
in losses of billions for sure.

153
00:09:10,343 --> 00:09:12,060
Thee, Thee…

154
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,619
I thought of him just leaving,

155
00:09:13,619 --> 00:09:15,685
but now we've been sabotaged.

156
00:09:15,685 --> 00:09:18,724
Thada! Don't talk nonsense!

157
00:09:20,641 --> 00:09:21,641
Father,

158
00:09:21,641 --> 00:09:25,573
does this mean we have to hurry
and appoint the second line to take over?

159
00:09:26,113 --> 00:09:29,074
Do you think those people are capable of
doing the job?

160
00:09:32,386 --> 00:09:33,386
Thawat.

161
00:09:34,976 --> 00:09:38,123
Go get Thee back to work, no matter what.

162
00:09:38,123 --> 00:09:39,320
If you can't,

163
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,755
I'll cut ties with both you and your son.

164
00:09:44,779 --> 00:09:45,779
Sure.

165
00:09:46,624 --> 00:09:49,546
Next time we meet, I hope it'll be good news.

166
00:10:27,188 --> 00:10:29,661
I came to let Dad and Mom know that…

167
00:10:30,678 --> 00:10:33,046
Prim and I are getting married.

168
00:10:33,046 --> 00:10:34,046
What?

169
00:10:34,633 --> 00:10:35,935
Really, son?

170
00:10:35,935 --> 00:10:37,298
I'm happy for you!

171
00:10:37,298 --> 00:10:41,118
I'm thrilled. I'll be gaining another daughter.

172
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:44,376
What's there to be happy about?

173
00:10:44,376 --> 00:10:45,885
I called you here…

174
00:10:45,885 --> 00:10:48,973
to talk about
how your grandpa wants you back at work.

175
00:10:49,748 --> 00:10:53,410
Not to hear that
you're going to marry Secretary Prim!

176
00:10:54,871 --> 00:10:57,586
Look, how many times do I have to say this?

177
00:10:57,586 --> 00:10:59,279
No one agrees with this!

178
00:11:00,012 --> 00:11:01,264
But I do.

179
00:11:05,139 --> 00:11:06,366
You do too, Mom?

180
00:11:07,856 --> 00:11:09,642
If you ask me a million times,

181
00:11:09,642 --> 00:11:12,275
my answer will still be yes, a million times.

182
00:11:12,821 --> 00:11:14,188
Because I'm…

183
00:11:15,069 --> 00:11:16,356
[Prim's team]

184
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:17,469
Huh?

185
00:11:17,469 --> 00:11:19,299
Hey, you're really doing this?

186
00:11:19,299 --> 00:11:20,432
Yes.
[Prim's team]

187
00:11:23,511 --> 00:11:24,751
Dad,

188
00:11:24,751 --> 00:11:27,206
please don't try to
stand in the way of their love.

189
00:11:27,906 --> 00:11:31,256
Thee and Prim have been
through bad times together,

190
00:11:31,256 --> 00:11:32,646
taking care of each other.

191
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,626
They deserve to be able to take care
of each other like this forever.

192
00:11:35,626 --> 00:11:36,806
Isn't that right?

193
00:11:36,806 --> 00:11:40,069
Even so, your grandpa will never agree to this.

194
00:11:40,069 --> 00:11:42,444
No matter how good your reasons are.

195
00:11:43,064 --> 00:11:44,176
That's fine.

196
00:11:44,850 --> 00:11:46,218
I'm just here to let you know,

197
00:11:46,218 --> 00:11:47,585
not to ask for permission.

198
00:11:48,877 --> 00:11:51,420
No matter what, I'm going to marry Prim.

199
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:53,861
Yes, it's clear.

200
00:11:53,861 --> 00:11:57,548
Dad, if you truly can't accept this
or if you absolutely disagree…

201
00:11:58,201 --> 00:11:59,723
I understand.

202
00:11:59,723 --> 00:12:01,318
You don't have to come to my wedding.

203
00:12:02,365 --> 00:12:03,706
Serves you right.

204
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:09,530
Here!

205
00:12:10,138 --> 00:12:11,766
You're sleeping outside the room

206
00:12:11,766 --> 00:12:15,043
until you've sorted things out
with your family.

207
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,925
Don't make me repeat myself.

208
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:19,489
Oh, come on.

209
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:22,972
One side's my father, the other's my son.

210
00:12:22,972 --> 00:12:26,009
What do you want me to do?
I'm stuck in the middle here.

211
00:12:26,895 --> 00:12:28,221
There's no middle ground.

212
00:12:28,221 --> 00:12:30,892
In this matter, you have to pick a side.

213
00:12:32,442 --> 00:12:34,271
It's not like I haven't tried.

214
00:12:34,271 --> 00:12:36,128
You know I've made so many attempts already.

215
00:12:36,808 --> 00:12:38,617
You also know, don't you?

216
00:12:38,617 --> 00:12:42,191
This problem is too complicated
for me to solve.

217
00:12:43,734 --> 00:12:45,849
You're talking about a problem.

218
00:12:45,849 --> 00:12:48,331
I've got a simple equation for you.

219
00:12:48,918 --> 00:12:50,975
We love our son.

220
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:52,616
Our son loves Prim.

221
00:12:53,463 --> 00:12:56,018
So, we have to love Prim too.

222
00:12:56,018 --> 00:12:59,334
Why can't you figure out something
as simple as that?

223
00:13:00,587 --> 00:13:03,762
You know I don't have anything
against Prim at all, right?

224
00:13:06,905 --> 00:13:08,432
It's easy to say,

225
00:13:08,432 --> 00:13:10,451
but doing it is hard, you know…

226
00:13:10,451 --> 00:13:12,079
Stop saying it's hard.

227
00:13:12,659 --> 00:13:17,096
There's nothing too difficult
for parents to do for their children.

228
00:13:19,781 --> 00:13:22,570
Look, let me ask you something.

229
00:13:22,570 --> 00:13:25,998
If we went back in time,
and I didn't have any status,

230
00:13:26,718 --> 00:13:30,834
if I didn't come from a family
that matched yours,

231
00:13:31,426 --> 00:13:34,311
and I were in the exact same position
as Prim right now,

232
00:13:34,311 --> 00:13:36,019
would you bow down to Grandpa,

233
00:13:36,572 --> 00:13:38,914
give in to those stupid rules,

234
00:13:38,914 --> 00:13:40,882
and just leave me like that?

235
00:13:42,033 --> 00:13:45,268
You don't need to answer.
I'll answer it for you.

236
00:13:46,565 --> 00:13:49,199
No matter what, you would never leave me.

237
00:13:50,545 --> 00:13:51,628
Do you know why?

238
00:13:53,469 --> 00:13:57,284
Because I know that the man
standing in front of me right now

239
00:13:58,321 --> 00:13:59,594
is a good person,

240
00:14:00,245 --> 00:14:01,447
a talented person,

241
00:14:02,154 --> 00:14:05,628
and someone who has always been brave enough
to face any obstacle.

242
00:14:06,521 --> 00:14:11,066
And this time, I believe that
the man standing in front of me

243
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:13,019
will be just as brave.

244
00:14:25,666 --> 00:14:28,293
Hey, is the boss really going to resign?

245
00:14:28,883 --> 00:14:30,589
Is he resigning or not?

246
00:14:30,589 --> 00:14:33,693
Just resigning out of nowhere
without even a heads-up?

247
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:37,214
Seriously, do you even know anything? Huh?

248
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:38,880
Nope.

249
00:14:39,769 --> 00:14:40,897
My head hurts.

250
00:14:40,897 --> 00:14:43,097
If this keeps up,
aren't we all going to lose our jobs?

251
00:14:43,097 --> 00:14:44,839
- Oh…
- No…

252
00:14:50,607 --> 00:14:52,367
My baby's calling.

253
00:14:52,994 --> 00:14:57,795
Let me go act stressed and sad
to get some attention.

254
00:14:59,454 --> 00:15:01,502
Yeah, Miss Popular!

255
00:15:01,502 --> 00:15:03,471
Honestly, is it a guy or a loan shark?

256
00:15:03,471 --> 00:15:04,497
Just tell me the truth.

257
00:15:08,422 --> 00:15:10,462
I'm a human being, not trash.

258
00:15:15,899 --> 00:15:17,100
I'm so tired of you.

259
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:20,500
People who love to
show off their love in public.

260
00:15:20,500 --> 00:15:21,540
Oh, geez!

261
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:22,859
I've got someone too, okay?

262
00:15:22,859 --> 00:15:24,906
I just don't like showing it off.

263
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,304
Hey, girl!

264
00:15:32,304 --> 00:15:35,596
I'm telling you a whole dramatic story,
and you're not even reacting?

265
00:15:35,596 --> 00:15:38,296
Did someone ghost you or something?
You're pulling that face!

266
00:15:38,296 --> 00:15:39,296
That's right.

267
00:15:40,055 --> 00:15:43,088
He told me he doesn't want to date me yet.

268
00:15:43,594 --> 00:15:46,458
Because he doesn't want me
to struggle with him.

269
00:15:46,458 --> 00:15:49,155
Oh no, crap!

270
00:15:49,155 --> 00:15:50,250
I just said random things,

271
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,170
and it hit a nerve with her.

272
00:15:54,004 --> 00:15:55,004
So…

273
00:15:55,750 --> 00:15:56,801
Who is this guy?

274
00:15:57,475 --> 00:15:58,475
Do I know him?

275
00:15:59,136 --> 00:16:01,289
Bhum, even if you kill me, I won't tell you.

276
00:16:01,289 --> 00:16:02,524
Oh, you little…

277
00:16:03,538 --> 00:16:05,253
That guy told me that…

278
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:09,158
he doesn't want to waste time or money on love.

279
00:16:09,158 --> 00:16:11,346
He said he wants to get on his feet first.

280
00:16:12,233 --> 00:16:15,764
Look, if he says this,
it means he's a good guy.

281
00:16:16,384 --> 00:16:19,430
He doesn't plan to leech off you.

282
00:16:19,430 --> 00:16:21,163
I support him!

283
00:16:21,163 --> 00:16:23,874
Go for it, keep pushing, go, go, go!

284
00:16:23,874 --> 00:16:25,181
Energy boosting!

285
00:16:25,181 --> 00:16:26,832
Don't give up and don't ever give up.

286
00:16:26,832 --> 00:16:28,012
I'm cheering for you!

287
00:16:28,012 --> 00:16:30,614
But he already rejected me…

288
00:16:31,546 --> 00:16:33,613
Mind, look at this.

289
00:16:33,613 --> 00:16:35,592
Look at the sweat under my armpit.

290
00:16:35,592 --> 00:16:36,799
Can you see it here?

291
00:16:37,345 --> 00:16:39,016
The world is hot and boiling,

292
00:16:39,016 --> 00:16:40,856
ready to break apart any moment now.

293
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:42,526
You can't just sit there, hesitating.

294
00:16:42,526 --> 00:16:46,598
If you really like him,
you should try pursuing him a little longer.

295
00:16:46,598 --> 00:16:49,678
And if you do pursue him and give it your best,

296
00:16:49,678 --> 00:16:52,123
but he still doesn't notice you,
then come to me.

297
00:16:54,146 --> 00:16:55,760
Come back and lean on me.

298
00:16:56,266 --> 00:16:57,628
Just come back to me.

299
00:16:57,628 --> 00:16:58,976
Will it really work?

300
00:16:59,516 --> 00:17:01,818
I think your chest is kind of flat.

301
00:17:03,930 --> 00:17:05,030
Just kidding!

302
00:17:05,772 --> 00:17:07,072
Thank you so much!

303
00:17:08,167 --> 00:17:10,513
Yeah, you're welcome, girl.

304
00:17:11,067 --> 00:17:12,515
You sat there with a sulky face.

305
00:17:16,545 --> 00:17:19,421
You're a good person, Manchuphorn Thekinsak.

306
00:17:24,861 --> 00:17:26,061
Hello, Father.

307
00:17:26,808 --> 00:17:28,441
- Hello, brother.
- Hello.

308
00:17:29,008 --> 00:17:30,453
What now?

309
00:17:30,453 --> 00:17:33,121
You've managed
to drag Thee back here, haven't you?

310
00:17:35,642 --> 00:17:37,128
Not at all.

311
00:17:37,128 --> 00:17:40,604
I just came to tell you that
I'm going to my son's wedding.

312
00:17:40,604 --> 00:17:41,604
What?

313
00:17:42,626 --> 00:17:46,572
Since I can't stop him,
I might as well support him instead.

314
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:49,831
How dare you go against my orders?

315
00:17:50,377 --> 00:17:53,130
Do you want to be kicked out of the family too?

316
00:17:53,684 --> 00:17:55,356
No need to kick me out, Father.

317
00:17:55,863 --> 00:17:59,362
I'll resign from the company
and leave the family myself.

318
00:17:59,362 --> 00:18:00,562
Resign?

319
00:18:01,885 --> 00:18:04,240
Here's my new surname.

320
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:05,440
I've already registered it.

321
00:18:10,731 --> 00:18:14,198
"Theeranonsakunnnnlll"?

322
00:18:14,198 --> 00:18:16,839
That's right, Theeranonsakunnnnlll.

323
00:18:18,516 --> 00:18:21,011
I had the local monk come up with it.

324
00:18:21,011 --> 00:18:23,380
He said my old surname was fine,

325
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:27,460
but if I add three extra "L"s and three "N"s,

326
00:18:27,460 --> 00:18:31,821
it'll make everything smooth,
swift, and cheerful!

327
00:18:33,831 --> 00:18:34,949
It's not funny!

328
00:18:37,863 --> 00:18:40,303
Do you think I wouldn't dare?

329
00:18:40,303 --> 00:18:43,100
Is that why you're joking around
like this with me?

330
00:18:43,100 --> 00:18:44,241
Not at all, Father.

331
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:46,860
I know you're brave enough to do anything.

332
00:18:47,740 --> 00:18:50,345
I'm your son, so I'm just as brave as you.

333
00:18:50,345 --> 00:18:53,763
I'm brave enough to protect
and support my own child's happiness.

334
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:56,458
Oh, stop with the smooth talk.

335
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:57,658
Mind your own business.

336
00:18:59,131 --> 00:19:00,231
Brother!

337
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:06,543
I understand that the family rules
you've set are very important.

338
00:19:06,543 --> 00:19:08,663
But what meaning would those rules have

339
00:19:08,663 --> 00:19:11,646
if there were no children left
in the family to uphold them?

340
00:19:14,571 --> 00:19:15,671
Excuse me, then.

341
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:21,633
I'm going to use my new surname,

342
00:19:22,321 --> 00:19:25,214
Theeranonsakunnnnlll.

343
00:19:39,393 --> 00:19:40,838
Prim…

344
00:19:40,838 --> 00:19:42,413
Where's your washing machine?

345
00:19:43,798 --> 00:19:44,979
What are you doing, Boss?

346
00:19:45,996 --> 00:19:47,176
Helping you with the laundry.

347
00:19:47,770 --> 00:19:49,986
It's fine. I'll do it myself.

348
00:19:49,986 --> 00:19:53,870
Come on, let your future husband
help his future wife with the housework.

349
00:19:54,905 --> 00:19:56,712
I said no, didn't I?

350
00:19:58,595 --> 00:19:59,739
Are you teasing me?

351
00:19:59,739 --> 00:20:01,890
Stop! Put it down right now.

352
00:20:01,890 --> 00:20:04,238
- Give it here.
- No! Come on, hurry up!

353
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:06,298
- No! Hey!
- No!

354
00:20:32,291 --> 00:20:34,051
What's more important than the rules…

355
00:20:35,445 --> 00:20:37,695
is the smiles of the next generation, right?

356
00:20:40,975 --> 00:20:42,075
Who are you, mister?

357
00:20:42,766 --> 00:20:44,936
And why are you parking
in front of my house like this?

358
00:20:45,724 --> 00:20:46,724
Is that appropriate?

359
00:20:59,685 --> 00:21:00,905
What are you laughing at?

360
00:21:00,905 --> 00:21:03,716
Seeing you up close,
I really can't take your state, man.

361
00:21:03,716 --> 00:21:08,567
Hey, I get that you're trying
to impress your future father-in-law,

362
00:21:08,567 --> 00:21:10,677
but did you really have to
dress like a rockstar

363
00:21:10,677 --> 00:21:12,651
mixed with a Thai country vibe?

364
00:21:14,026 --> 00:21:15,242
Not really.

365
00:21:15,242 --> 00:21:17,360
I actually went and got my clothes from home,

366
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,400
but I felt like dressing like this
was kinda fun, you know?

367
00:21:21,193 --> 00:21:23,301
You can have your fun,

368
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:24,985
but at least sit properly, alright?

369
00:21:24,985 --> 00:21:27,750
- Oh, right.
- Show some respect to your friends.

370
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:29,900
- Watermelon smoothie, here you go.
- Thank you, Prim.

371
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:32,203
Oh no, I just remembered

372
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:33,803
this is Ann's favorite drink!

373
00:21:33,803 --> 00:21:35,205
Oh, I'm so sorry.

374
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:37,782
Oh, come here, Prim.

375
00:21:38,566 --> 00:21:39,810
Watch me sip this.

376
00:21:41,809 --> 00:21:43,806
I've moved on already.

377
00:21:43,806 --> 00:21:45,617
No more tears,

378
00:21:46,249 --> 00:21:47,249
seriously!

379
00:21:48,457 --> 00:21:53,517
Pat, I want to apologize to you
about resigning.

380
00:21:55,355 --> 00:21:57,058
I know I prepared everything

381
00:21:57,058 --> 00:21:59,046
but you must've still been
really swamped, right?

382
00:22:01,508 --> 00:22:05,296
So, who did they appoint
as the new Vice President after me?

383
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:09,541
That's actually why I'm here today.

384
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:11,639
Who?

385
00:22:18,487 --> 00:22:19,527
What?

386
00:22:19,527 --> 00:22:20,615
Me?

387
00:22:20,615 --> 00:22:21,655
Yep.

388
00:22:21,655 --> 00:22:24,530
It's an order from the head of the main house

389
00:22:24,530 --> 00:22:27,116
reappointing you as Vice President.

390
00:22:27,116 --> 00:22:29,670
And reinstating your dad as President.

391
00:22:30,770 --> 00:22:32,798
And that's not all.

392
00:22:32,798 --> 00:22:38,653
There's also an order approving you and Prim…

393
00:22:40,938 --> 00:22:42,397
to get married!

394
00:22:42,397 --> 00:22:44,221
- What? What!
- Yeah! Yep!

395
00:22:44,221 --> 00:22:45,324
- For real?
- Totally real.

396
00:22:45,324 --> 00:22:47,572
- You're not joking, right?
- Why would I lie about this?

397
00:22:48,185 --> 00:22:49,286
Prim!

398
00:22:49,286 --> 00:22:50,780
- I'm getting married.
- Yeah!

399
00:22:51,533 --> 00:22:53,288
I'm getting married!

400
00:22:54,756 --> 00:22:55,756
Boss!

401
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:58,260
No shame being that sweet in front of me?

402
00:22:59,066 --> 00:23:00,166
But it's fine,

403
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:03,336
I got my sweetness
from the watermelon smoothie already.

404
00:23:06,406 --> 00:23:09,670
Who cares? I've moved on.

405
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,120
So cute!

406
00:23:13,477 --> 00:23:15,366
Oh my gosh, I'm dying!

407
00:23:22,345 --> 00:23:23,345
Hey…

408
00:23:27,002 --> 00:23:28,705
Where are you going?

409
00:23:28,705 --> 00:23:30,775
To sleep outside, of course.

410
00:23:32,073 --> 00:23:34,587
Go back and sleep in the room.

411
00:23:36,466 --> 00:23:37,879
- Really?
- Yeah.

412
00:23:40,275 --> 00:23:41,275
I'm not mad now.

413
00:23:49,384 --> 00:23:53,552
I've always wanted a daughter,
but I only have two sons.

414
00:23:54,312 --> 00:23:57,311
I used to envy my friends who have daughters,

415
00:23:57,884 --> 00:24:02,176
but now I have you, Prim,
as my daughter-in-law.

416
00:24:02,176 --> 00:24:04,458
It feels like a dream come true.

417
00:24:06,753 --> 00:24:11,076
Oh, a new color is out now!

418
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,076
Prim…

419
00:24:12,711 --> 00:24:15,759
Which color do you want?
You can choose whatever you like.

420
00:24:15,759 --> 00:24:19,231
Or if you prefer a certain brand,
I'll arrange it.

421
00:24:19,231 --> 00:24:21,497
This shop, I have shares in it,

422
00:24:21,497 --> 00:24:23,734
but I'll let Dad pay his share.

423
00:24:26,768 --> 00:24:30,304
That's very kind,
but I can't accept this, Mrs.Chollada.

424
00:24:31,672 --> 00:24:33,570
Why are you still calling me "Mrs. Chollada"?

425
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:34,761
Call me Mother instead!

426
00:24:36,859 --> 00:24:38,826
Yes, Mother.

427
00:24:39,868 --> 00:24:41,641
That's better!

428
00:24:44,825 --> 00:24:45,825
How sweet.

429
00:24:50,904 --> 00:24:56,182
Let him be. Don't worry about it.
It's good to train the men to wait.

430
00:24:56,182 --> 00:24:59,731
They'll learn
who's really in charge in the house.

431
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:08,672
Oh my, I just remembered,

432
00:25:08,672 --> 00:25:10,907
the bag store just released a new collection.

433
00:25:10,907 --> 00:25:14,085
How about we go pick out a bag?
Let me take you shopping.

434
00:25:14,085 --> 00:25:15,987
And then we can head to the jewelry store too.

435
00:25:15,987 --> 00:25:18,292
Come on, let's go! Come here!

436
00:25:20,193 --> 00:25:21,539
Is it not over yet, Dad?

437
00:25:21,539 --> 00:25:23,748
I guess they're going to shop
until the store is empty.

438
00:25:26,731 --> 00:25:28,011
- Dad.
- Yeah?

439
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:31,241
Thank you so much for everything.

440
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:35,928
Well, just like your mom said,

441
00:25:36,482 --> 00:25:39,618
your happiness is our happiness too.

442
00:25:44,306 --> 00:25:45,592
Can I ask you something?

443
00:25:46,892 --> 00:25:47,892
What is it?

444
00:25:49,522 --> 00:25:53,141
If you get married,
hurry up and have kids for your mom,

445
00:25:54,207 --> 00:25:58,104
so she can spoil the grandchild
and I can escape to play golf.

446
00:25:58,817 --> 00:26:02,291
That way, I won't have to wait around
while she shops like this.

447
00:26:02,291 --> 00:26:03,683
It's so boring.

448
00:26:05,773 --> 00:26:09,714
By the way,
when will I get to visit Prim's family?

449
00:26:10,454 --> 00:26:11,694
Oh, right.

450
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:20,644
Are your future brother-in-law's parents,
inviting us to dinner at their house?

451
00:26:21,993 --> 00:26:24,298
Or do they just want to see how we are,

452
00:26:24,298 --> 00:26:26,743
to see if we can handle it once we're there?

453
00:26:26,743 --> 00:26:30,374
Who knows, when they meet us, they might say,

454
00:26:30,374 --> 00:26:33,196
"Don't marry, dear,
it might tarnish our family's reputation."

455
00:26:34,569 --> 00:26:36,564
Oh Pear, you're just saying.

456
00:26:36,564 --> 00:26:38,188
We're fine.

457
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:40,843
Except for…

458
00:26:48,811 --> 00:26:50,184
What are you looking at?

459
00:26:50,184 --> 00:26:51,739
What's wrong with my appearance?

460
00:26:51,739 --> 00:26:53,235
Everything.

461
00:26:53,928 --> 00:26:55,096
Okay, that's touching.

462
00:26:55,819 --> 00:26:56,869
Don't worry, Prim.

463
00:26:56,869 --> 00:26:59,479
I'll make sure to polish Dad up,
scrub him clean,

464
00:26:59,479 --> 00:27:02,333
Scrub off sweat stains
and dress him up to look handsome.

465
00:27:02,333 --> 00:27:04,286
Don't worry, you won't be embarrassed.

466
00:27:04,286 --> 00:27:05,830
Share the location of your boss's house to me

467
00:27:05,830 --> 00:27:06,928
and we'll meet there.

468
00:27:09,906 --> 00:27:11,867
Oh, sweat stains.

469
00:27:14,367 --> 00:27:15,870
Eat up, my dear, don't look.

470
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:22,271
Tomorrow, dress as normal as possible?

471
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:25,050
I don't want to make Prim's family feel tense.

472
00:27:25,765 --> 00:27:27,125
Oh, I understand.

473
00:27:27,125 --> 00:27:28,319
Yeah.

474
00:27:28,319 --> 00:27:31,205
So, what's Prim's father like?

475
00:27:31,205 --> 00:27:32,558
What kind of person is he?

476
00:27:33,131 --> 00:27:37,656
So that me and your mom can figure out
how to get along with him.

477
00:27:44,872 --> 00:27:47,360
- What kind of person is he?
- Yeah.

478
00:27:48,825 --> 00:27:50,324
You could say he's…

479
00:27:51,335 --> 00:27:52,513
a rocker.

480
00:28:11,479 --> 00:28:12,815
You look so beautiful.

481
00:28:14,753 --> 00:28:16,326
You look good too.

482
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:23,188
My family is almost here.

483
00:28:24,616 --> 00:28:26,657
Are you okay? Are you nervous?

484
00:28:28,242 --> 00:28:29,342
Yes, a lot.

485
00:28:30,309 --> 00:28:32,497
My dad doesn't really act like other people.

486
00:28:32,497 --> 00:28:34,639
I'm worried he might do something strange.

487
00:28:40,654 --> 00:28:43,320
You don't have to worry, I'm here with you.

488
00:28:43,320 --> 00:28:45,535
Everything will go smoothly.

489
00:28:54,359 --> 00:28:56,341
This house is really fancy!

490
00:28:56,341 --> 00:28:57,341
Right?

491
00:29:00,804 --> 00:29:02,820
Hey, where did Dad go?

492
00:29:17,460 --> 00:29:20,328
Dad, hurry up!

493
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:25,072
The lawn is even bigger than our house!
Let's go home.

494
00:29:25,072 --> 00:29:26,788
- Let's go.
- Oh, wait, wait, wait!

495
00:29:26,788 --> 00:29:27,794
Not today.

496
00:29:27,794 --> 00:29:30,755
Today, you're the adult on Prim's side,
you have to be patient.

497
00:29:30,755 --> 00:29:32,895
Hey, an adult, huh?

498
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:35,596
Even the village chief or the district officer
would be nervous at this meeting.

499
00:29:36,503 --> 00:29:38,575
By the way, where did you rent this suit from?

500
00:29:38,575 --> 00:29:39,575
It's so itchy!

501
00:29:40,957 --> 00:29:42,556
- Just bear with it, Dad.
- Yeah.

502
00:29:42,556 --> 00:29:43,917
Do it for Prim, just for today.

503
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,063
Please…

504
00:29:45,063 --> 00:29:46,063
Okay?

505
00:29:46,735 --> 00:29:51,923
Okay, I'll do my best for my daughter!

506
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:55,877
Before you do your best,
can you at least lower your voice first?

507
00:29:55,877 --> 00:29:58,021
Make it match the suit you're wearing.

508
00:29:58,021 --> 00:29:59,522
It's like my earwax is doing a dance!

509
00:30:00,027 --> 00:30:01,027
Yeah, great.

510
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:05,069
That explains why the weather's so great today!

511
00:30:05,069 --> 00:30:07,942
You're wearing a suit, Dad,
looking so handsome!

512
00:30:09,255 --> 00:30:11,556
Actually, I could wear this every day,

513
00:30:12,163 --> 00:30:13,375
but I don't want to,

514
00:30:13,375 --> 00:30:16,647
because I'm afraid if girls walk by,
they'll waste their time admiring me.

515
00:30:16,647 --> 00:30:18,386
You don't want to wear it,
or you just don't know how?

516
00:30:18,386 --> 00:30:21,163
This morning you're still asking
if the tie is tied like a shoelace.

517
00:30:21,163 --> 00:30:23,351
Stop teasing me.

518
00:30:23,351 --> 00:30:26,588
We're at their house,
we need to dress seriously to match the house!

519
00:30:26,588 --> 00:30:27,408
That's right.

520
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:29,276
Is that right? The handsome future son-in-law?

521
00:30:29,883 --> 00:30:31,139
Yes, it is.

522
00:30:31,139 --> 00:30:32,139
See?

523
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:35,700
By the way, where are your
future father-in-law and mother-in-law?

524
00:30:36,692 --> 00:30:38,102
They should be…

525
00:30:58,612 --> 00:31:02,366
Hello, rockers!

526
00:31:07,273 --> 00:31:11,910
Hey, I think we might have
misunderstood something here.

527
00:31:12,743 --> 00:31:17,673
That's true.
You told me this family dresses like this.

528
00:31:17,673 --> 00:31:19,936
Look at me, my hair's all messy.

529
00:31:20,696 --> 00:31:24,248
Out rock-star outfit
is totally making a statement, huh?

530
00:31:25,009 --> 00:31:26,009
Yeah.

531
00:31:46,546 --> 00:31:47,546
Prim!

532
00:31:48,423 --> 00:31:52,365
I just realized that
your future brother-in-law is really handsome.

533
00:31:55,041 --> 00:31:56,368
Is the food good?

534
00:31:56,368 --> 00:31:57,368
He's good-looking!

535
00:31:57,956 --> 00:31:58,956
- Hey.
- Oh.

536
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:04,207
It's really delicious, ma'am.

537
00:32:05,754 --> 00:32:08,244
Next time, you should come over more often.

538
00:32:08,244 --> 00:32:10,756
Everything's better with company,
and the food gets delicious!

539
00:32:16,068 --> 00:32:17,168
We're sorry.

540
00:32:17,771 --> 00:32:19,879
It's just that
we're not used to dressing like this.

541
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:24,586
If that's the case,
let me get straight to the point.

542
00:32:25,881 --> 00:32:29,462
Actually, I don't want to
make this too formal or anything,

543
00:32:29,462 --> 00:32:35,450
but I'm concerned that
Prim's father might think we're not serious.

544
00:32:36,785 --> 00:32:38,919
You could tell it wasn't serious
just from the outfit.

545
00:32:38,919 --> 00:32:39,919
Tham!

546
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:45,389
Would you have any objections

547
00:32:45,389 --> 00:32:51,140
if we asked for Prim's hand
in marriage from Thee?

548
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:53,251
N-N-No objections at all!

549
00:32:55,788 --> 00:32:58,548
And don't worry about
the dowry or wedding expenses,

550
00:32:58,548 --> 00:33:00,331
We'll take care of everything.

551
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:05,121
However, we'd like to follow our family's
Chinese customs for the ceremony.

552
00:33:06,147 --> 00:33:11,802
As for the wedding, we'll handle all the costs.

553
00:33:11,802 --> 00:33:14,523
I love Prim like my own daughter,

554
00:33:14,523 --> 00:33:18,265
so I'll make sure everything is perfect
for my daughter-in-law.

555
00:33:22,591 --> 00:33:27,819
Oh, Prim, if you want, after the wedding
you can come live with us here.

556
00:33:27,819 --> 00:33:31,253
We'll build a house on the land next to us,

557
00:33:31,253 --> 00:33:34,834
and if you feel lonely,
you can invite your father to stay with us too!

558
00:33:35,827 --> 00:33:37,569
It's okay, I'm soloing the guitar loudly.

559
00:33:37,569 --> 00:33:39,460
- Oh…
- It's okay!

560
00:33:39,460 --> 00:33:41,335
I'll build a house for the newlyweds,

561
00:33:41,335 --> 00:33:44,931
so when we have grandchildren,
you can come visit often.

562
00:33:49,169 --> 00:33:51,709
Thank you so much for your kindness,

563
00:33:52,289 --> 00:33:54,561
but I would like to accept only
the gesture of goodwill.

564
00:33:56,715 --> 00:33:57,923
Why's that?

565
00:34:01,522 --> 00:34:03,550
I talked to Boss,

566
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:05,918
and I'd like to build a small family with him.

567
00:34:06,754 --> 00:34:10,140
As for the dowry, I don't think it's necessary.

568
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:11,917
Dad feels the same way, right?

569
00:34:11,917 --> 00:34:12,917
I don't think so.

570
00:34:14,102 --> 00:34:15,800
I don't think about it too.

571
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:20,943
As for the wedding,

572
00:34:20,943 --> 00:34:23,548
I don't want to have
a grand celebration.

573
00:34:23,548 --> 00:34:25,306
It's just wasting money.

574
00:34:25,306 --> 00:34:26,882
I'd prefer to have a small ceremony

575
00:34:26,882 --> 00:34:30,129
with just the people we love and who love us.

576
00:34:30,129 --> 00:34:31,330
That's enough.

577
00:34:32,108 --> 00:34:36,285
And both Boss and I will cover
all the expenses ourselves.

578
00:34:41,503 --> 00:34:44,057
I'm not surprised at all

579
00:34:44,057 --> 00:34:47,070
why my son…

580
00:34:47,070 --> 00:34:50,359
loves you so much.

581
00:34:52,726 --> 00:34:55,066
You have raised your daughter really well.

582
00:34:57,489 --> 00:34:59,699
I'm sorry, Prim,

583
00:34:59,699 --> 00:35:03,867
for making you feel uncomfortable
with all the nonsense for so long.

584
00:35:05,573 --> 00:35:08,895
So, does that mean
we can get ready to celebrate now?

585
00:35:08,895 --> 00:35:10,180
Yes, that's right! Yeah, sure!

586
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:11,601
Oh, yo, yo, yo!

587
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:14,512
Cheers!

588
00:35:36,065 --> 00:35:38,873
So, why did you invite me here for?

589
00:35:40,168 --> 00:35:42,574
Well, it's not too crowded here,

590
00:35:43,127 --> 00:35:44,669
so you don't have to overthink things.

591
00:35:49,338 --> 00:35:51,473
Here, take this.

592
00:35:52,529 --> 00:35:53,529
What's this?

593
00:35:58,493 --> 00:36:00,760
Hey, this is sweet and sour stir-fry.

594
00:36:07,351 --> 00:36:08,691
Are you…

595
00:36:09,959 --> 00:36:11,672
I didn't buy this to flirt with you, okay?

596
00:36:12,432 --> 00:36:16,138
I just happened to go to that shop
and thought of you,

597
00:36:16,138 --> 00:36:17,260
so I bought it for you.

598
00:36:20,512 --> 00:36:21,512
Thanks.

599
00:36:24,153 --> 00:36:25,153
Well…

600
00:36:26,758 --> 00:36:30,116
I know you want to achieve your goals first,

601
00:36:31,706 --> 00:36:33,606
but I also want you to love yourself.

602
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:35,794
Don't just focus on work

603
00:36:36,883 --> 00:36:39,324
and chasing success to the point
where you destroy yourself.

604
00:36:44,419 --> 00:36:46,060
I'll try to do that.

605
00:36:50,663 --> 00:36:53,833
And stop wearing the same old shirt like that.

606
00:36:53,833 --> 00:36:55,801
Get some new clothes to wear,

607
00:36:57,631 --> 00:36:59,117
and don't forget to wash them too.

608
00:37:01,781 --> 00:37:05,248
I want you to try good food, live a life,

609
00:37:05,248 --> 00:37:08,451
and do fun things that people our age do.

610
00:37:10,131 --> 00:37:12,234
Don't sacrifice today for tomorrow.

611
00:37:15,090 --> 00:37:19,013
And don't pressure yourself too much either,

612
00:37:20,632 --> 00:37:23,093
because I really can't help
but worry about you.

613
00:37:27,125 --> 00:37:29,929
Think of it as a friend's concern.

614
00:37:38,918 --> 00:37:39,918
Thanks.

615
00:37:45,038 --> 00:37:46,038
I'll see you.

616
00:38:07,202 --> 00:38:09,200
Hey, just confirm it.

617
00:38:09,200 --> 00:38:10,876
Confirmation about what?

618
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,078
Prim is really going to marry the boss, right?

619
00:38:14,905 --> 00:38:15,905
That's right.

620
00:38:17,326 --> 00:38:18,561
That's great!

621
00:38:19,836 --> 00:38:25,295
But come to think of it,
their relationship's like a rollercoaster ride.

622
00:38:25,895 --> 00:38:26,899
Think about it.

623
00:38:26,899 --> 00:38:29,099
Back in the day,
they were both gossiped about, right?

624
00:38:29,099 --> 00:38:31,784
Prim quit her job, and the boss did too.

625
00:38:31,784 --> 00:38:34,596
Then, somehow, the boss came back to work

626
00:38:34,596 --> 00:38:36,463
and asked Prim to marry him.

627
00:38:36,463 --> 00:38:39,899
And now, they're getting married.

628
00:38:39,899 --> 00:38:43,060
I really want to know
which temple they visited,

629
00:38:43,060 --> 00:38:47,578
and where they made a wish.
I want to have a good love like theirs too.

630
00:38:47,578 --> 00:38:50,889
Hey, wait. Does Bhum know about this?

631
00:38:50,889 --> 00:38:54,079
If she finds out,
she's going to scream in shock, right?

632
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:57,656
She doesn't know yet.
I don't even know where Bhum went either.

633
00:38:57,656 --> 00:38:59,140
Yeah, right?

634
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,078
I think I know.

635
00:39:02,033 --> 00:39:05,081
This is really the juiciest thing ever!

636
00:39:08,093 --> 00:39:09,193
You know it too?

637
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:18,312
Yong, what's this meeting about? Huh?

638
00:39:18,312 --> 00:39:22,231
Wait, are you planning to
invite me somewhere tonight? Huh?

639
00:39:24,038 --> 00:39:25,038
It's not like that.

640
00:39:27,185 --> 00:39:28,285
What's going on?

641
00:39:28,905 --> 00:39:31,782
Oh, did the boss scold you?

642
00:39:32,859 --> 00:39:36,651
Wait, but the boss didn't come
to work today, right?

643
00:39:37,618 --> 00:39:39,374
Or is it about "Pen, dear?"

644
00:39:39,374 --> 00:39:41,541
Is "Pen, dear" sick? What's going on with her?

645
00:39:41,541 --> 00:39:44,860
Bhum, I think we have
some issues between us now.

646
00:39:45,419 --> 00:39:46,519
Issues?

647
00:39:47,810 --> 00:39:49,718
- Lueang?
- Yellow.

648
00:39:49,718 --> 00:39:51,245
- Mamuang?
- Mango.

649
00:39:52,291 --> 00:39:53,744
Bhum, enough.

650
00:39:53,744 --> 00:39:55,759
I mean, the issue between the two of us.

651
00:39:56,797 --> 00:39:58,583
The issue between us two?

652
00:40:00,044 --> 00:40:02,057
I don't think it's working anymore.

653
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:04,643
Not working?

654
00:40:04,643 --> 00:40:06,820
What's not working? How is it not working?

655
00:40:08,086 --> 00:40:10,568
I'm not sure if you really like me, Bhum.

656
00:40:11,983 --> 00:40:13,218
Why would you say that?

657
00:40:14,058 --> 00:40:15,935
Well, all this time you've been seeing me,

658
00:40:15,935 --> 00:40:17,363
we've had to sneak around,

659
00:40:17,990 --> 00:40:20,225
Every time we want to talk or meet,

660
00:40:20,818 --> 00:40:23,684
it always has to be
at the fire escape, restrooms…

661
00:40:24,457 --> 00:40:25,644
storage rooms…

662
00:40:27,734 --> 00:40:29,318
the only place left is the trash room.

663
00:40:31,182 --> 00:40:32,813
Want to give it a try?

664
00:40:32,813 --> 00:40:33,813
I'm serious.

665
00:40:38,504 --> 00:40:41,298
If you're embarrassed to date me, I understand.

666
00:40:41,878 --> 00:40:43,913
I know I'm not right for you, Bhum.

667
00:40:45,240 --> 00:40:47,287
You're like a jet plane soaring in the sky,

668
00:40:48,558 --> 00:40:51,066
while I'm just a dog
lying in front of a 7-Eleven.

669
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,539
The dog has to know its place, right?

670
00:40:54,539 --> 00:40:56,393
- Like a knife.
- Cleaver.

671
00:40:58,710 --> 00:41:00,510
Hey, wait a minute.

672
00:41:01,030 --> 00:41:03,253
Sorry about that. I'll be serious now.

673
00:41:03,780 --> 00:41:05,521
Then let's make it official.

674
00:41:06,053 --> 00:41:08,380
Huh? Is that really a good idea?

675
00:41:08,380 --> 00:41:10,114
Nothing could be better than this.

676
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:12,813
Let's go announce to
everyone that we're together.

677
00:41:12,813 --> 00:41:13,813
Let's go.

678
00:41:15,079 --> 00:41:16,079
Come on!

679
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:35,816
- I think you need to…
- You need to be patient.

680
00:41:35,816 --> 00:41:37,754
- Find details to elaborate…
- And then we…

681
00:41:37,754 --> 00:41:39,658
- It needs to be clearly separated.
- This is the same.

682
00:41:39,658 --> 00:41:40,984
- It should be the same.
- Great, it's great.

683
00:41:40,984 --> 00:41:42,393
Just to focus on the small details…

684
00:41:45,844 --> 00:41:48,193
Everyone! I have something to tell you!

685
00:41:49,119 --> 00:41:54,420
Yong and I are officially dating!

686
00:41:56,861 --> 00:41:59,195
And for this one,
you need to do a bit more research.

687
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:00,886
That way, it'll have full details.

688
00:42:00,886 --> 00:42:03,763
This one too.

689
00:42:05,051 --> 00:42:06,442
Maybe it was a little too soft.

690
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,237
Everyone!

691
00:42:09,237 --> 00:42:12,650
- Yong and I…
- Oh, come on!

692
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:14,572
Why are you shouting so much?

693
00:42:14,572 --> 00:42:17,592
Everyone in the office already knows!

694
00:42:18,105 --> 00:42:19,520
Oh really?

695
00:42:20,213 --> 00:42:21,213
Huh?

696
00:42:23,125 --> 00:42:25,816
Congratulations!

697
00:42:28,032 --> 00:42:30,657
Oh… so everyone already knows?

698
00:42:30,657 --> 00:42:33,484
So, up until now, I was…

699
00:42:33,484 --> 00:42:35,180
I wasn't being subtle at all?

700
00:42:36,375 --> 00:42:38,438
Look, let me tell you,

701
00:42:38,438 --> 00:42:42,865
nothing escapes the prying eyes of Miss Namwan!

702
00:42:42,865 --> 00:42:45,411
But you were snooping around,
so you knew anyway.

703
00:42:45,411 --> 00:42:47,027
- You're the one who's more nosy.
- You are.

704
00:42:47,027 --> 00:42:50,446
- You!
- You are!

705
00:42:50,446 --> 00:42:53,386
Oh, this is not the time to argue!

706
00:42:53,892 --> 00:42:58,033
We should be celebrating
with Bhum and Yong right now!

707
00:42:58,033 --> 00:43:02,238
That's right!
Now you don't have to hide anymore.

708
00:43:02,238 --> 00:43:05,197
Feel free to be all lovey-dovey.

709
00:43:06,391 --> 00:43:07,884
Okay!

710
00:43:09,241 --> 00:43:10,514
Thank you!

711
00:43:10,514 --> 00:43:13,160
I promise I'll do my best.

712
00:43:13,160 --> 00:43:15,665
Everywhere, throughout the company.

713
00:43:15,665 --> 00:43:18,300
- Yong, go, go!
- Oh, hey!

714
00:43:18,300 --> 00:43:21,577
My boyfriend! Hey, come back here right now!

715
00:43:25,351 --> 00:43:28,622
You're really not coming back
to be my secretary?

716
00:43:28,622 --> 00:43:29,622
I feel lonely.

717
00:43:30,801 --> 00:43:32,723
Don't try to act cute!

718
00:43:32,723 --> 00:43:34,671
You already have Mind.

719
00:43:35,305 --> 00:43:37,879
Just work and come back here.

720
00:43:38,392 --> 00:43:40,427
So we can go look at wedding stuff.

721
00:43:41,758 --> 00:43:47,244
Okay, ma'am.
I promise our wedding will be cute and perfect!

722
00:43:48,613 --> 00:43:51,478
Sure, see you later.

723
00:44:17,664 --> 00:44:18,664
Mom…

724
00:44:20,297 --> 00:44:22,893
Prim is going to marry a prince!

725
00:44:24,410 --> 00:44:26,249
I'm not sure how the wedding will be,

726
00:44:27,646 --> 00:44:29,351
please be my support, Mom!

727
00:44:50,588 --> 00:44:54,787
May you be happy
and love each other for generations to come.

728
00:45:36,235 --> 00:45:40,145
At 3 pm, you can start welcoming the guests.

729
00:45:40,145 --> 00:45:42,346
Then, at 5 pm,
the groom will somersault into the venue.

730
00:45:42,346 --> 00:45:43,438
- Oh, okay.
- Right.

731
00:45:43,438 --> 00:45:45,221
Then we'll dance.

732
00:45:46,063 --> 00:45:47,063
Let me taste it.

733
00:45:51,007 --> 00:45:52,677
It's delicious!

734
00:45:52,677 --> 00:45:53,804
It's hot, be careful.

735
00:46:04,322 --> 00:46:06,028
- I'll help peel it.
- Go ahead.

736
00:46:06,028 --> 00:46:07,408
- Yong, be careful.
- Yeah.

737
00:46:10,477 --> 00:46:11,911
Hey, Yong?

738
00:46:19,906 --> 00:46:21,620
- Pround, look!
- Huh?

739
00:46:22,859 --> 00:46:25,816
The 8th wonder of the world is right there!

740
00:46:28,171 --> 00:46:29,344
Why is that?

741
00:46:29,344 --> 00:46:30,864
Oh, look.

742
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:33,925
If the boss hadn't marry Prim,

743
00:46:33,925 --> 00:46:36,532
we wouldn't have seen a chair lift like this.

744
00:46:36,532 --> 00:46:38,526
It's definitely impossible.

745
00:46:38,526 --> 00:46:42,154
The boss must be really excited
about his own wedding, right?

746
00:46:42,154 --> 00:46:45,388
He invested a lot,
even lifting the chair by himself, Yong.

747
00:46:45,388 --> 00:46:48,850
That's true. Even though Prim wants to
organize a small wedding by herself,

748
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:52,457
someone like the boss still wants
everything to be perfect.

749
00:46:53,232 --> 00:46:55,001
Will it be perfect, though?

750
00:46:55,001 --> 00:46:56,274
There…

751
00:46:56,274 --> 00:46:58,582
Look at the rain!
It's definitely going to rain.

752
00:46:59,355 --> 00:47:00,455
Yeah, right.

753
00:47:17,020 --> 00:47:18,187
How's it looking?

754
00:47:19,173 --> 00:47:22,246
All the weather apps say
there's a 50 percent chance of rain today.

755
00:47:22,246 --> 00:47:25,309
But none of the apps confirm it will rain here.

756
00:47:26,357 --> 00:47:28,786
But looking on the bright side,
I think it won't rain.

757
00:47:29,446 --> 00:47:31,888
I prefer to look at things
pessimistically first.

758
00:47:33,711 --> 00:47:35,979
Or should we hire someone
to bring in extra tents?

759
00:47:36,726 --> 00:47:39,052
No, let's go to the hotel next door instead.

760
00:47:39,052 --> 00:47:41,386
- I'll just buy the hotel and arrange it there.
- Wait, wait. Calm down.

761
00:47:41,386 --> 00:47:42,995
You're going to buy the hotel?

762
00:47:43,582 --> 00:47:46,483
If the tents come now,
will they make it in time?

763
00:47:46,483 --> 00:47:48,285
Just a few more hours
until the auspicious moment

764
00:47:48,285 --> 00:47:50,667
your mom chose beforehand.

765
00:47:52,473 --> 00:47:53,573
So, what should we do then?

766
00:47:57,518 --> 00:47:59,235
How about we try the traditional way?

767
00:48:00,113 --> 00:48:01,523
Traditional way?

768
00:48:05,045 --> 00:48:07,233
So, who's going to do it?

769
00:48:09,316 --> 00:48:10,484
Are you going to do it, June?

770
00:48:10,484 --> 00:48:13,611
No, I'm going to tell you,
I've got two kids now, I can't do it.

771
00:48:15,801 --> 00:48:17,176
I can't do it either.

772
00:48:17,176 --> 00:48:19,476
My daughter is so mischievous,
she's like a little monkey.

773
00:48:20,002 --> 00:48:22,071
Hey… it's you, Pround!

774
00:48:24,354 --> 00:48:25,615
Don't you remember?

775
00:48:25,615 --> 00:48:27,529
Last year, I went to Samet Island with Top.

776
00:48:28,342 --> 00:48:30,714
Went to Samet with Top? Samet?

777
00:48:31,541 --> 00:48:33,165
You told me Top was gay!

778
00:48:33,798 --> 00:48:35,069
He's not gay.

779
00:48:36,328 --> 00:48:37,619
Pround, put your hands together!

780
00:48:37,619 --> 00:48:39,088
Don't preach yet, Pear!

781
00:48:40,190 --> 00:48:42,083
So, who's going to perform the ritual?

782
00:48:50,500 --> 00:48:55,532
Well, I can't, I had a boyfriend in college.

783
00:49:04,257 --> 00:49:05,257
Where are you going?

784
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,230
Are you having a stomach ache?

785
00:49:20,039 --> 00:49:21,627
Times have changed, huh?

786
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:23,579
It's like…

787
00:49:23,579 --> 00:49:26,255
So scandalous, so scandalous!

788
00:49:31,489 --> 00:49:33,115
Yeah, Bhum!

789
00:49:33,115 --> 00:49:36,618
You've told me you're going to
keep your virginity

790
00:49:36,618 --> 00:49:38,885
until the wedding day, right?

791
00:49:44,025 --> 00:49:45,802
Go for it, Bhum! We'll leave it to you.

792
00:49:45,802 --> 00:49:47,667
We're all counting on you now.

793
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:50,204
- Good luck!
- Go for it!

794
00:49:50,204 --> 00:49:51,456
- Let's go!
- Come on.

795
00:49:51,456 --> 00:49:52,819
- Go on!
- Wishing you success!

796
00:49:52,819 --> 00:49:54,956
- I'll get dressed then!
- We'll leave it to you!

797
00:50:05,958 --> 00:50:07,572
Do you really think it's a good idea?

798
00:50:07,572 --> 00:50:10,859
What if we set it up and then a storm hits,
what are we going to do?

799
00:50:10,859 --> 00:50:12,595
How can we be sure that…

800
00:50:13,188 --> 00:50:16,100
nothing happened between us
on the Loy Krathong night in my room?

801
00:50:16,100 --> 00:50:18,228
When we were both so drunk
that everything went blank?

802
00:50:18,228 --> 00:50:20,943
That's nothing happened between us?

803
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,680
Yeah, that's right.

804
00:50:24,360 --> 00:50:27,817
But I don't think anything happened, Yong.

805
00:50:27,817 --> 00:50:31,438
I believe nothing happened between us.

806
00:50:33,333 --> 00:50:36,228
I'll stay a virgin, come on!

807
00:50:38,799 --> 00:50:41,575
If you say so, let's stick it in!

808
00:50:46,177 --> 00:50:47,420
All the powers…

809
00:50:47,420 --> 00:50:48,500
I didn't do anything.

810
00:50:48,500 --> 00:50:50,060
Please let the weather stay clear.

811
00:50:50,060 --> 00:50:51,300
I swear, I didn't do anything.

812
00:50:51,300 --> 00:50:56,257
Let the sky be clear, no rain. Amen.

813
00:51:11,059 --> 00:51:12,159
It worked!

814
00:51:13,331 --> 00:51:15,294
Clear sky!

815
00:51:24,585 --> 00:51:25,729
I'm sorry.

816
00:51:25,729 --> 00:51:27,159
Are you hurt anywhere, sweetheart?

817
00:51:27,159 --> 00:51:29,676
Yeah… I wasn't paying attention.

818
00:51:29,676 --> 00:51:30,678
- I'm sorry.
- Ploen!

819
00:51:30,678 --> 00:51:32,619
I told you,
remember to watch where you're going!

820
00:51:32,619 --> 00:51:33,787
Sorry about that.

821
00:51:39,099 --> 00:51:41,690
Hey, it's you.

822
00:51:44,584 --> 00:51:47,611
You're kindhearted Uncle I met
on the Loy Krathong day, right?

823
00:51:49,808 --> 00:51:51,001
So…

824
00:51:51,001 --> 00:51:53,396
What brings you here?

825
00:51:54,438 --> 00:51:58,459
Oh, I'm a friend of the groom. And you?

826
00:51:58,999 --> 00:52:00,261
I'm…

827
00:52:01,034 --> 00:52:02,852
the bride's sister.

828
00:52:02,852 --> 00:52:06,139
Huh? You're Secretary Prim's older sister?

829
00:52:11,152 --> 00:52:12,530
Small world, isn't it?

830
00:52:13,525 --> 00:52:18,300
I've never liked the world being small
as much as I do today.

831
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:24,249
Kindhearted Uncle is more handsome today
than he was the other day.

832
00:52:24,249 --> 00:52:28,712
Wow, with all this praise,
I might just float up to the sky!

833
00:52:31,516 --> 00:52:33,989
Doesn't Mom like Kindhearted Uncle?

834
00:52:33,989 --> 00:52:35,844
- Ploen, sweetie!
- Oh…

835
00:52:37,665 --> 00:52:41,543
Sorry about that.
Ploen is the type who just says random things.

836
00:52:41,543 --> 00:52:42,742
Oh, it's fine.

837
00:52:42,742 --> 00:52:46,882
I think kids who talk a lot
and talk endlessly are cute.

838
00:52:49,662 --> 00:52:50,911
Well…

839
00:52:52,449 --> 00:52:56,095
I'll go prepare for the event now.

840
00:52:56,095 --> 00:52:59,739
Oh, if you need anything, just let me know.

841
00:52:59,739 --> 00:53:04,302
Call 089-79456, beep, beep.

842
00:53:07,651 --> 00:53:11,742
Wait, the last two digits,
beep, beep, what are they?

843
00:53:12,768 --> 00:53:15,896
If you want to know, come and decode it!

844
00:53:20,837 --> 00:53:23,794
So, that guy won't be coming to the event?

845
00:53:27,451 --> 00:53:28,987
I really wanted him to come.

846
00:53:31,751 --> 00:53:33,025
Hey, girl.

847
00:53:33,025 --> 00:53:35,743
What are you standing here for?
Aren't you going to get dressed?

848
00:53:35,743 --> 00:53:38,155
Standing here enjoying the breeze
like you're in a MV.

849
00:53:38,155 --> 00:53:39,742
Go get dressed, hurry up!

850
00:53:40,799 --> 00:53:42,597
You're so slow, huh?

851
00:54:28,478 --> 00:54:31,172
You… bought a new suit?

852
00:54:32,951 --> 00:54:33,951
Yep.

853
00:54:35,379 --> 00:54:37,268
It looks great on you.

854
00:54:40,199 --> 00:54:41,770
I'm going on a date today.

855
00:54:47,979 --> 00:54:49,124
A date?

856
00:54:50,025 --> 00:54:52,545
Yeah, my first date.

857
00:54:55,390 --> 00:54:56,490
Oh…

858
00:55:03,139 --> 00:55:04,139
Well…

859
00:55:05,908 --> 00:55:09,751
I hope your date goes smoothly.

860
00:55:15,544 --> 00:55:16,957
It's up to you, really.

861
00:55:17,477 --> 00:55:19,558
If you go with me…

862
00:55:19,558 --> 00:55:21,981
My date will be smooth.

863
00:55:25,212 --> 00:55:26,212
Yeah?

864
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,227
Go with you?

865
00:55:31,792 --> 00:55:32,792
To where?

866
00:55:33,919 --> 00:55:35,019
To date, of course.

867
00:55:44,798 --> 00:55:45,798
Well…

868
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:50,244
besides being stingy,

869
00:55:53,426 --> 00:55:56,442
I can be slow with my feelings too.

870
00:55:57,791 --> 00:55:58,791
But now…

871
00:55:59,414 --> 00:56:02,362
I know that actually…

872
00:56:03,772 --> 00:56:06,132
I… have feelings for you.

873
00:56:09,818 --> 00:56:10,818
Sorry about that,

874
00:56:12,678 --> 00:56:16,385
but I hope you haven't changed your mind…

875
00:56:20,904 --> 00:56:22,354
I haven't changed my mind.

876
00:56:24,681 --> 00:56:27,842
Let's… Let's go on the date.

877
00:56:37,300 --> 00:56:41,999
So after the event,
how about we go eat sweet and sour pork?

878
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:44,799
Yeah.

879
00:56:45,656 --> 00:56:50,088
Or we can have your basil stir-fry instead,

880
00:56:50,088 --> 00:56:51,683
so we don't have to spend any money.

881
00:56:53,399 --> 00:56:54,618
Let's eat both!

882
00:59:04,126 --> 00:59:06,456
Please take care of the apple of my eye.

883
00:59:08,419 --> 00:59:10,704
I'll take care of Prim
as best as I can, Father.

884
00:59:48,438 --> 00:59:50,195
Kiss, kiss, kiss.

885
00:59:53,204 --> 00:59:55,529
Kiss, kiss, kiss!

886
01:00:08,383 --> 01:00:09,631
- Go ahead!
- Go, go!

887
01:00:18,035 --> 01:00:21,186
With such heavy rain, who stuck the lemongrass?

888
01:00:24,250 --> 01:00:26,502
- I did.
- Huh?

889
01:00:27,250 --> 01:00:28,928
I'm sorry.

890
01:00:31,571 --> 01:00:36,479
I didn't mean it.
I just realized it wasn't virgin now.

891
01:00:41,315 --> 01:00:44,101
The event is ruined, everything is a mess.

892
01:00:44,961 --> 01:00:46,447
I'm really sorry.

893
01:00:46,447 --> 01:00:49,115
I really tried to make it perfect for you.

894
01:00:50,763 --> 01:00:53,507
We don't have to be perfect
all the time, right?

895
01:00:53,507 --> 01:00:56,746
Life's got its ups and downs,
that's just how it is.

896
01:00:56,746 --> 01:00:59,792
What really matters is
who we share those moments with.

897
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:03,364
And besides, I'm not the kind of bride
who's afraid of the rain.

898
01:01:33,300 --> 01:01:34,400
Goody!

899
01:01:35,338 --> 01:01:36,338
Kiew!

900
01:01:40,516 --> 01:01:41,616
Let's go.

901
01:02:58,227 --> 01:03:02,383
♫ The moment of falling in love
Feels just like this ♫

902
01:03:02,383 --> 01:03:06,488
♫ That split second when I saw you ♫

903
01:03:06,488 --> 01:03:09,781
♫ The way you smiled, the way you blushed ♫
