1
00:01:05,009 --> 00:01:07,979
Now, I'm thankful to Thee
for leading me to you.

2
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:10,117
Do you like my brother?
Why do you want to talk to him so much?

3
00:01:10,117 --> 00:01:14,120
I just want to recall the memories
of when I was kidnapped. That's all.

4
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,843
You'll have to meet him regularly
to revive those memories, right?

5
00:01:16,843 --> 00:01:17,843
Yes.

6
00:01:19,597 --> 00:01:23,421
When I was kidnapped,
I remember hearing a bang like that.

7
00:01:23,421 --> 00:01:25,770
Ever since then,
I've been scared of loud noises.

8
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:28,219
I've wondered why you act like this.

9
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:31,967
If there's something bothering you,
you can tell me.

10
00:01:31,967 --> 00:01:33,402
I'm scared of something.

11
00:01:35,236 --> 00:01:37,882
But I'll try my best
to overcome this fear for you.

12
00:01:50,843 --> 00:01:52,141
How are you, Mom?

13
00:01:53,496 --> 00:01:56,176
We miss you, Mom.

14
00:01:58,655 --> 00:02:00,555
Sweet dreams, Grandma.

15
00:02:07,356 --> 00:02:10,539
I hope Grandpa has a little happiness
and drinks a lot of alcohol.

16
00:02:11,745 --> 00:02:13,770
"I hope you have a lot of happiness
and drink a little alcohol."

17
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:14,929
Okay, okay.

18
00:02:14,929 --> 00:02:16,027
Let's try again, try again.

19
00:02:16,738 --> 00:02:19,790
I hope Grandpa has a lot of happiness
and drinks a little alcohol.

20
00:02:19,790 --> 00:02:21,297
Oh, so cute! Haha!

21
00:02:29,387 --> 00:02:31,173
Well, Dad,

22
00:02:31,173 --> 00:02:35,583
I wish you good health and
hope you stay with us for a long, long time.

23
00:02:36,936 --> 00:02:38,787
I also wish for you, to follow your dreams,

24
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:41,995
to achieve everything you've ever wanted.

25
00:02:43,223 --> 00:02:47,198
After quitting your job, I hope you finally
live a life that's truly your own.

26
00:02:52,287 --> 00:02:54,322
Lately, Prim seems to be in love.

27
00:02:54,322 --> 00:02:56,331
Maybe she doesn't want to quit her job anymore.

28
00:02:57,692 --> 00:03:00,012
Huh? Prim's getting a boyfriend?

29
00:03:00,819 --> 00:03:03,336
- Who is it?
- No, not yet, Dad.

30
00:03:03,336 --> 00:03:04,881
Pround just misunderstood.

31
00:03:05,689 --> 00:03:08,810
Good. You can't trust men these days.

32
00:03:08,810 --> 00:03:11,809
Listen, if you can't
find someone as good as me,

33
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:13,016
you're better off without one.

34
00:03:13,989 --> 00:03:16,729
If it's someone like dad,
people around the world wouldn't be single.

35
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,174
- Yeah?
- You don't need to worry.

36
00:03:18,174 --> 00:03:20,174
I'll look out for her.

37
00:03:23,375 --> 00:03:27,298
I need to head to work now.
The company is holding an event today.

38
00:03:27,298 --> 00:03:28,688
I can't take the day off.

39
00:03:29,944 --> 00:03:32,049
So dedicated to work!

40
00:03:32,049 --> 00:03:35,385
No wonder your handsome boss won't let you go.

41
00:03:36,577 --> 00:03:39,513
That won't do! Your life must be your own.

42
00:03:39,513 --> 00:03:42,114
Let me know if someone tries to hold you back.
I'll handle it myself.

43
00:03:42,114 --> 00:03:43,943
And if talking things out doesn't work,

44
00:03:43,943 --> 00:03:46,517
it might have to come down to some gun action.

45
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:47,517
- What?
- What?

46
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:49,811
Dad, you have a gun?

47
00:03:49,811 --> 00:03:50,811
Of course.

48
00:03:54,009 --> 00:03:55,210
Right here!

49
00:03:55,210 --> 00:03:56,357
No way, Dad!

50
00:04:32,295 --> 00:04:34,338
Prim, if it's really him, I don't support it.

51
00:04:36,385 --> 00:04:39,590
That boss of yours.
Does he even commit to you seriously, huh?

52
00:04:39,590 --> 00:04:41,874
His family sailed in from China,

53
00:04:41,874 --> 00:04:43,056
Our family?

54
00:04:43,056 --> 00:04:45,832
We tumbled down the mountains from Lanna!

55
00:04:49,803 --> 00:04:52,128
Look, wealthy families like his

56
00:04:52,128 --> 00:04:54,881
are bound to find someone suitable for him.

57
00:04:55,666 --> 00:04:58,270
You'll get tired of hearing me
lecture you all the time,

58
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,506
but I just don't want you to regret it later.

59
00:05:10,316 --> 00:05:13,121
Oh, Prim, haven't you changed
into your traditional Thai outfit yet?

60
00:05:13,121 --> 00:05:14,370
Yeah.

61
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,370
Not yet.

62
00:05:17,489 --> 00:05:19,599
This is really going all out, isn't it?

63
00:05:19,599 --> 00:05:20,599
Just a bit.

64
00:05:21,291 --> 00:05:23,871
But I'm so annoyed. I lost a bet!

65
00:05:23,871 --> 00:05:25,896
I was supposed to dress as a beckoning lady,

66
00:05:25,896 --> 00:05:27,762
But look, I have to dress up
as some kind of masculine soldier.

67
00:05:27,762 --> 00:05:30,309
And there's a mustache too. It's so itchy!

68
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:32,808
It suits you, though.
Matches your strong, masculine features.

69
00:05:34,307 --> 00:05:36,032
Thanks, everyone,

70
00:05:36,032 --> 00:05:38,312
for helping out,
even during a long holiday break.

71
00:05:38,312 --> 00:05:39,524
Oh, come on.

72
00:05:39,524 --> 00:05:41,820
Who's going to let you
run this event all on your own?

73
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:43,770
I love you to bits, Prim!

74
00:05:45,528 --> 00:05:49,175
The truth is, no guy asked you out,

75
00:05:49,175 --> 00:05:50,888
so now you're pretending to love her,

76
00:05:50,888 --> 00:05:54,250
want to help Prim
and want extra overtime, right?

77
00:05:54,250 --> 00:05:56,702
Honestly, I just didn't
have anyone to ask me out.

78
00:05:56,702 --> 00:05:58,649
But you? Nobody wants you!

79
00:05:58,649 --> 00:05:59,748
Shut your mouth, right now!

80
00:06:03,543 --> 00:06:07,013
Oh, anyway, isn't this the first event

81
00:06:07,013 --> 00:06:09,667
where the boss and Jinny are showing up
after their breakup?

82
00:06:09,667 --> 00:06:10,934
- Is that right?
- Yeah, yeah!

83
00:06:10,934 --> 00:06:14,623
- Is this an old flame rekindling, Prim?
- Exactly!

84
00:06:14,623 --> 00:06:16,369
- Do you know what's going on, Prim?
- Do you?

85
00:06:16,369 --> 00:06:18,855
- Gossip a little? I'm interested!
- Yeah, me too.

86
00:06:18,855 --> 00:06:20,850
Honestly, I don't really know either.

87
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:23,504
Then, let me go change first.

88
00:06:24,437 --> 00:06:26,440
What? I want to know.

89
00:06:38,270 --> 00:06:41,569
Hold on! Calm down, Jinny.

90
00:06:41,569 --> 00:06:44,442
Is there something you need, Jinny?

91
00:06:44,442 --> 00:06:46,269
Prim, can you help me with something?

92
00:06:46,269 --> 00:06:50,052
Oh, of course! If you're missing anything,
just let the team know or call me,

93
00:06:50,052 --> 00:06:52,154
and I'll take care of it for you.

94
00:06:52,154 --> 00:06:55,216
I want Thee. Can you arrange that for me?

95
00:06:56,405 --> 00:06:57,410
Excuse me?

96
00:06:57,410 --> 00:06:59,796
Well, I just want to
get back together with Thee.

97
00:06:59,796 --> 00:07:01,962
That's why I made sure
to be a part of this Songkran event.

98
00:07:01,962 --> 00:07:05,561
It's because I asked the agency to plead

99
00:07:05,561 --> 00:07:07,330
with the mall client

100
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:09,616
and then asked them to convince Thee again.

101
00:07:09,616 --> 00:07:11,958
So, he can come to the event with me.

102
00:07:13,676 --> 00:07:15,640
I just don't understand
why Thee is being so distant with me.

103
00:07:17,421 --> 00:07:20,609
Or Thee already have someone else?

104
00:07:22,616 --> 00:07:24,473
I don't think so.

105
00:07:25,323 --> 00:07:26,323
Really?

106
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:28,910
Yes, really.

107
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:34,810
That's a relief.

108
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:37,929
Then, could you help
play matchmaker for me, please?

109
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:43,891
Please, Prim! I really want
to make up with Thee!

110
00:07:44,745 --> 00:07:49,101
Oh, I'm not very good at
being a matchmaker, you see…

111
00:07:49,101 --> 00:07:51,387
Prim, it's nothing much at all.

112
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:55,071
You just need to help me get closer to Thee

113
00:07:55,071 --> 00:08:00,734
and guide me on what to do to win his heart.

114
00:08:00,734 --> 00:08:02,162
That's all!

115
00:08:04,934 --> 00:08:05,934
Well…

116
00:08:06,809 --> 00:08:10,308
And if anyone tries to flirt with Thee,
let me know,

117
00:08:10,308 --> 00:08:13,953
I will slap her again and again.

118
00:08:15,809 --> 00:08:18,208
Sure, absolutely!

119
00:08:18,208 --> 00:08:21,172
But honestly, I'm not sure what advice to give.

120
00:08:21,172 --> 00:08:24,906
I truly believe that your natural charm
will surely win over the boss's heart!

121
00:08:25,996 --> 00:08:28,704
You have to get dressed up now.
The event's about to start.

122
00:08:28,704 --> 00:08:29,704
Let's go!

123
00:09:08,596 --> 00:09:10,615
You look so beautiful
in traditional Thai attire.

124
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:13,318
Thank you.

125
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:18,237
So, after the event,
shall we grab something to eat?

126
00:09:21,263 --> 00:09:22,716
I…

127
00:09:24,309 --> 00:09:25,626
Do you have plans?

128
00:09:27,248 --> 00:09:28,441
What plans do you have?

129
00:09:34,312 --> 00:09:35,638
Thee.

130
00:09:39,511 --> 00:09:41,277
The boss is waiting for you.

131
00:09:43,204 --> 00:09:44,204
Really?

132
00:09:45,685 --> 00:09:46,685
No, I'm not.

133
00:09:48,077 --> 00:09:51,649
Yes, you are,
because you need to go to the event together.

134
00:09:52,337 --> 00:09:55,202
If there's nothing else,
I'll go and run the event now.

135
00:09:59,376 --> 00:10:03,184
I'm taking you to get dressed up.
We're going on a date today, too.

136
00:10:03,795 --> 00:10:04,795
Let's go!

137
00:10:07,411 --> 00:10:09,273
Jinny, wait a moment.

138
00:10:09,273 --> 00:10:10,958
I need to go take care of something first.

139
00:10:15,764 --> 00:10:16,764
Prim.

140
00:10:20,561 --> 00:10:21,561
What's wrong?

141
00:10:23,529 --> 00:10:24,790
Nothing.

142
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:27,510
Definitely something. Why are you mad at me?

143
00:10:29,336 --> 00:10:30,336
No, I'm not mad.

144
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:32,480
I'll go to work now.

145
00:10:35,751 --> 00:10:36,851
You're definitely mad.

146
00:10:38,285 --> 00:10:39,285
I'm not.

147
00:10:42,507 --> 00:10:43,894
You can't escape from me.

148
00:10:50,037 --> 00:10:51,408
Where did the boss go?

149
00:10:51,408 --> 00:10:52,787
We were just talking a moment ago.

150
00:10:53,725 --> 00:10:54,802
I'm so confused.

151
00:11:02,693 --> 00:11:04,570
Is this how you're playing it, Secretary Prim?

152
00:11:06,751 --> 00:11:08,058
Thank you.

153
00:11:15,815 --> 00:11:17,442
Let's leave it here for now.

154
00:11:25,109 --> 00:11:27,729
Oh, wait a minute. Stop!

155
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,250
I won't play! My leather jacket will get wet.

156
00:11:30,250 --> 00:11:32,155
Old man, I wanted to play with you.

157
00:11:32,155 --> 00:11:35,321
Old man? My face is just vintage style.

158
00:11:36,348 --> 00:11:38,154
Everyone, let's go play somewhere else.

159
00:11:39,614 --> 00:11:41,742
Oh, these kids…

160
00:11:47,457 --> 00:11:51,684
Air purifier, who left this here?
It's still new.

161
00:11:55,404 --> 00:11:56,910
Whose air purifier is this?

162
00:11:59,507 --> 00:12:01,100
Did you leave this here?

163
00:12:04,632 --> 00:12:06,552
Well then, I'll take it.

164
00:12:07,473 --> 00:12:09,314
Okay, thank you.

165
00:12:11,124 --> 00:12:13,130
I wish you all the best.

166
00:12:15,013 --> 00:12:17,132
Such luck on Songkran Day!

167
00:12:31,744 --> 00:12:32,973
Where did the air purifier go?

168
00:12:52,011 --> 00:12:53,164
This guy!

169
00:12:57,037 --> 00:12:58,470
Excuse me, which room is he in?

170
00:12:58,470 --> 00:13:00,369
- Fourth floor, Fourth floor.
- Fourth floor?

171
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:04,270
Wait!

172
00:13:11,725 --> 00:13:12,769
You've already moved here?

173
00:13:12,769 --> 00:13:15,214
Where's the gift for your new neighbors?

174
00:13:15,975 --> 00:13:19,170
I didn't bring anything for you.
I came to take my stuff back!

175
00:13:19,703 --> 00:13:20,983
What are you doing? Hey!

176
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:24,491
How can you come
and take someone else's stuff like this?

177
00:13:25,077 --> 00:13:28,197
How can you say that? This is mine!

178
00:13:32,395 --> 00:13:33,895
Yours?

179
00:13:33,895 --> 00:13:37,909
Then why did you leave it like that?
I thought you threw it away.

180
00:13:38,681 --> 00:13:42,654
It's intact.
How could you think someone threw it away?

181
00:13:42,654 --> 00:13:44,055
Oh, come on!

182
00:13:44,055 --> 00:13:46,379
These days, people throw away
brand new things all the time.

183
00:13:46,379 --> 00:13:49,224
Like the table in my room,
someone left it there too.

184
00:13:50,099 --> 00:13:53,429
But if you want your thing back, just take it.
I don't want it anyway.

185
00:13:54,016 --> 00:13:58,608
It was bound to be like this.
You take my stuff, then you blame me.

186
00:13:58,608 --> 00:14:02,234
You should thank me
for not reporting it as theft.

187
00:14:02,234 --> 00:14:03,372
Keep that in mind.

188
00:14:16,524 --> 00:14:20,570
So what's your relationship?
Are you sweeter than ever this time around?

189
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:23,810
Who made the first move
to patch things up this time?

190
00:14:23,810 --> 00:14:26,210
And will there be good news
about marriage soon?

191
00:14:26,210 --> 00:14:27,410
Yeah, what would you say?

192
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:29,740
So, are they really back together now?

193
00:14:30,529 --> 00:14:32,127
How about that?

194
00:14:32,127 --> 00:14:35,152
Your boss got taken away by someone else!

195
00:14:36,223 --> 00:14:38,522
Feeling sad, huh? Right?

196
00:14:39,036 --> 00:14:42,132
Not at all. I've got a new perfect guy now!

197
00:14:43,085 --> 00:14:44,656
Who? Who's the new perfect guy?

198
00:14:44,656 --> 00:14:46,607
Who? Tell me, who is he?

199
00:14:46,607 --> 00:14:48,391
- Who? Tell me!
- I'm not telling you!

200
00:14:48,391 --> 00:14:49,689
- No way.
- Fine, whatever.

201
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,095
- Are you going to get married soon?
- When's the good news coming?

202
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:53,742
- Please answer!
- Answer us, please.

203
00:14:53,742 --> 00:14:55,315
- Please answer me!
- What would you say?

204
00:14:56,210 --> 00:14:58,476
Those two are a good match.

205
00:14:59,458 --> 00:15:01,405
It's right for them to be like this.

206
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,090
<i>- That's not true!</i>
- Hey!

207
00:15:05,090 --> 00:15:08,970
<i>You say no, but your heart says yes.</i>

208
00:15:08,970 --> 00:15:12,689
<i>This means you've fallen for him, right?</i>

209
00:15:12,689 --> 00:15:14,849
- No!
<i>- Yes!</i>

210
00:15:14,849 --> 00:15:17,090
- No!
<i>- Yes!</i>

211
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,569
<i>The boss is yours, only yours!</i>

212
00:15:20,569 --> 00:15:23,198
<i>Whoever gets in the way, just slap them!</i>

213
00:15:25,090 --> 00:15:26,615
<i>So, where are we going next?</i>

214
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:30,114
<i>You have an appointment in the evening,
and you also have a dinner with the organizer.</i>

215
00:15:31,197 --> 00:15:32,897
<i>Is that okay? Would you mind?</i>

216
00:15:34,831 --> 00:15:36,050
<i>No, please!</i>

217
00:15:37,847 --> 00:15:40,275
<i>I said stop! Stop! Don't do it!</i>

218
00:15:41,790 --> 00:15:44,227
Oh, what are you thinking?

219
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:47,723
Calm down, don't get distracted, Prim.

220
00:15:52,523 --> 00:15:53,716
We need to talk.

221
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:56,791
But the event is about to start.

222
00:15:56,791 --> 00:15:58,151
I don't care!

223
00:15:58,151 --> 00:16:01,257
Or do you want me to say
what I want to tell you on stage?

224
00:16:01,257 --> 00:16:04,299
That I like you,
and you're the one who's my girlfriend.

225
00:16:04,299 --> 00:16:05,702
Let's shock everyone!

226
00:16:06,729 --> 00:16:08,430
This is not the time for jokes!

227
00:16:08,997 --> 00:16:11,337
Does my face look like I'm joking?

228
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,182
I'm a man of my word, you know that.

229
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:25,057
What exactly do you want?

230
00:16:26,530 --> 00:16:28,027
I have to ask you, then.

231
00:16:28,027 --> 00:16:31,688
You know I'm hitting on you.
Why are you trying to pair me with Jinny?

232
00:16:31,688 --> 00:16:33,327
Have you ever thought about my feelings?

233
00:16:35,393 --> 00:16:37,513
You two are a good match.

234
00:16:37,513 --> 00:16:39,774
I'm the one who's not worthy of you.

235
00:16:40,619 --> 00:16:42,839
But I like you. I don't like Jinny.

236
00:16:45,855 --> 00:16:50,283
If two people want to be together forever,
liking each other isn't enough.

237
00:16:50,283 --> 00:16:51,900
There must be other factors too.

238
00:16:52,849 --> 00:16:55,694
For someone in a high position like you,
you need to consider that.

239
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,392
I don't want to be the one who holds you back.

240
00:17:00,315 --> 00:17:02,799
Are you speaking for yourself,
or are you quoting someone else?

241
00:17:04,427 --> 00:17:06,791
<i>Look, wealthy families like his</i>

242
00:17:06,791 --> 00:17:09,609
<i>are bound to find someone suitable for him.</i>

243
00:17:10,374 --> 00:17:12,574
<i>You'll get tired of hearing me
lecture you all the time,</i>

244
00:17:13,087 --> 00:17:16,160
<i>but I just don't want you to regret it later.</i>

245
00:17:22,304 --> 00:17:24,059
I should wake up from my dream now.

246
00:17:24,814 --> 00:17:27,374
And right now, you should get back to work.

247
00:17:27,374 --> 00:17:29,553
Please separate your work
from personal matters.

248
00:17:37,008 --> 00:17:41,144
And finally, thank you all so much
for joining our Songkran event.

249
00:17:41,144 --> 00:17:42,849
Our mall organizes this every year.

250
00:17:42,849 --> 00:17:45,258
We hope everyone has
received happiness and fun,

251
00:17:45,258 --> 00:17:47,934
welcoming Thai's New Year. Thank you so much.

252
00:17:55,508 --> 00:17:56,747
Thank you! Thank you!

253
00:17:56,747 --> 00:18:02,337
Let's have a big round of applause for
Mr. Chonlathorn, please.

254
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:10,207
And of course, from here on,
let's give a big round of applause

255
00:18:10,207 --> 00:18:14,176
for the Songkran procession!

256
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:36,449
Hey, doesn't Jinny usually have
the jakra and sangkh with her?

257
00:18:36,449 --> 00:18:39,597
Yeah, right? So where are the jakra and sangkh?

258
00:18:42,014 --> 00:18:44,387
I'm sorry, I forgot to give them to Jinny.

259
00:18:45,782 --> 00:18:48,019
- Oh, no!
- What should we do?

260
00:18:48,019 --> 00:18:49,128
I will take them to her.

261
00:19:00,748 --> 00:19:02,795
Jinny. Are you okay, Jinny!

262
00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:05,045
Jinny, are you okay?

263
00:19:07,926 --> 00:19:09,820
Jinny is fine.

264
00:19:11,774 --> 00:19:13,407
I'll take you to the hospital.

265
00:19:16,934 --> 00:19:18,327
Excuse me!

266
00:19:18,327 --> 00:19:19,847
- Excuse me!
- Pole, pole, pole!

267
00:19:22,384 --> 00:19:23,384
Sorry.

268
00:19:27,363 --> 00:19:29,457
I'm really sorry, Jinny.

269
00:19:30,348 --> 00:19:31,872
Please don't be mad at me.

270
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,050
Turn around and talk to me, please.

271
00:19:36,050 --> 00:19:40,176
I'm not mad, but I can't turn. My neck is hurt.

272
00:19:45,015 --> 00:19:47,555
But for you, Prim, I will turn.

273
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:54,575
You didn't do anything wrong.

274
00:19:54,575 --> 00:19:57,722
I fell by myself. You don't have to worry.

275
00:19:58,482 --> 00:20:02,072
Even though my body hurts,
my heart is full of joy.

276
00:20:03,592 --> 00:20:04,592
What?

277
00:20:05,675 --> 00:20:08,677
Actually, I should thank this accident
more than anything.

278
00:20:08,677 --> 00:20:10,502
It made Jinny realize

279
00:20:10,502 --> 00:20:14,609
how much Thee love and care about me.

280
00:20:14,609 --> 00:20:17,445
If it means more pain,
Jinny would accept it. Ouch!

281
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:25,034
Thee!

282
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,878
I brought something to visit you.
How are you, Jinny?

283
00:20:35,187 --> 00:20:38,321
Are you mad at me?
Why won't you turn and talk to me properly?

284
00:20:39,010 --> 00:20:43,151
I'm not mad. My neck is hurt, and I can't turn.

285
00:20:44,011 --> 00:20:46,361
But for you, Thee, I'll turn.

286
00:20:50,897 --> 00:20:54,287
Just seeing your face, my pain is already gone.

287
00:21:01,183 --> 00:21:03,756
So beautiful, thank you!

288
00:21:10,842 --> 00:21:14,108
If there's nothing else, I'll go now.

289
00:21:14,935 --> 00:21:16,980
So you can talk to the boss more easily.

290
00:21:17,962 --> 00:21:22,848
Don't worry, Prim.
I'm with Thee now, no need to be concerned.

291
00:21:35,330 --> 00:21:36,857
Thee!

292
00:21:39,818 --> 00:21:40,818
Where are you going?

293
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:16,819
Oh, Prim!

294
00:22:27,982 --> 00:22:30,674
The world is so small,
I didn't expect to see you here.

295
00:22:31,384 --> 00:22:32,384
Yes.

296
00:22:33,185 --> 00:22:35,407
And did you get allergic
to flower pollen again?

297
00:22:38,104 --> 00:22:40,971
Today, I'm not sure if it's the flower pollen

298
00:22:40,971 --> 00:22:42,963
or if I've just been crying, to be honest.

299
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:46,820
What are you doing here?

300
00:22:46,820 --> 00:22:48,882
I came to visit Jinny.

301
00:22:48,882 --> 00:22:51,776
There was a little accident
at the event we held today.

302
00:22:51,776 --> 00:22:54,521
Oh, was it serious?

303
00:22:54,521 --> 00:22:55,555
She's safe now.

304
00:22:57,170 --> 00:22:59,772
Do you have any other business?

305
00:22:59,772 --> 00:23:01,912
If not, how about we go grab something to eat?

306
00:23:03,832 --> 00:23:05,302
I'd rather not.

307
00:23:05,302 --> 00:23:09,166
Since it's Family Day,
I'd prefer to go home to my dad.

308
00:23:09,166 --> 00:23:11,172
I snuck away from him
earlier this morning as well.

309
00:23:12,869 --> 00:23:14,695
In that case, let me take you home.

310
00:23:14,695 --> 00:23:17,056
Well…

311
00:23:17,056 --> 00:23:19,592
Come on, I'm feeling lonely.

312
00:23:19,592 --> 00:23:20,880
I don't know where to go next.

313
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:22,867
Come on.

314
00:23:23,692 --> 00:23:24,692
Let's go.

315
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,910
Hey, wait a second!

316
00:23:48,158 --> 00:23:49,571
Hey, listen!

317
00:23:49,571 --> 00:23:51,624
Follow that car and block them for me, okay?

318
00:23:51,624 --> 00:23:52,624
Follow it!

319
00:24:06,222 --> 00:24:09,539
You can park here.
It's tricky to turn around in that alley.

320
00:24:17,269 --> 00:24:18,767
Thank you so much for the ride.

321
00:24:18,767 --> 00:24:19,767
It's no problem.

322
00:24:23,392 --> 00:24:25,110
No way! I don't want to play!

323
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:26,839
I'm soaked now! Hey!

324
00:24:28,275 --> 00:24:30,155
Hey! Oh no, wait!

325
00:24:31,929 --> 00:24:32,977
Stop right here, please.

326
00:25:04,571 --> 00:25:06,614
- Hey, slow down!
- Hey! Enough, guys!

327
00:25:07,725 --> 00:25:08,725
Okay, okay.

328
00:25:21,889 --> 00:25:22,889
Hey!

329
00:26:34,622 --> 00:26:37,035
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

330
00:26:38,168 --> 00:26:40,576
You didn't even mean to do it,
and yet it's all over my face.

331
00:26:41,300 --> 00:26:44,135
If you did mean it,
wouldn't I be drenched in soft-prepared chalk?

332
00:26:49,223 --> 00:26:51,362
So, what are you all doing here?

333
00:26:54,710 --> 00:26:58,330
Actually,
the company has a project where the boss

334
00:26:58,330 --> 00:27:00,510
comes to ask for blessings
from the employees' parents.

335
00:27:02,995 --> 00:27:03,995
Yes, that's right.

336
00:27:07,834 --> 00:27:10,529
Is this the one
making you work nonstop all day

337
00:27:10,529 --> 00:27:13,248
and won't let you resign? Is that right?

338
00:27:13,248 --> 00:27:14,905
Dad, you don't need to say that right now.

339
00:27:14,905 --> 00:27:16,601
If I'm not supposed to say it now,
when should I say it?

340
00:27:16,601 --> 00:27:19,364
Are they going to play water splashing
at your house all day or what?

341
00:27:20,578 --> 00:27:23,587
Well, here's the thing, Dad.
I asked for Prim's help

342
00:27:23,587 --> 00:27:26,256
in training the person
who will become my new secretary.

343
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:29,350
Once the training is done,
she can leave right away.

344
00:27:29,350 --> 00:27:30,827
How much longer will the training take?

345
00:27:30,827 --> 00:27:32,022
Not much longer, actually.

346
00:27:32,022 --> 00:27:33,911
Don't speak, I wasn't asking you.

347
00:27:35,522 --> 00:27:40,824
Hey, our dad's playing the tough role
quite well. He's talking so loudly.

348
00:27:41,622 --> 00:27:43,688
Tough? He just can't hear well.

349
00:27:44,630 --> 00:27:45,630
Oh, I forgot.

350
00:27:48,698 --> 00:27:52,889
Dad, I'm sorry for making Prim work so hard.

351
00:27:52,889 --> 00:27:55,489
From now on, I'll treat Prim better.

352
00:27:55,489 --> 00:27:58,816
I'll take good care of your daughter,
don't worry.

353
00:27:59,590 --> 00:28:00,590
Are you sure?

354
00:28:03,885 --> 00:28:07,525
"Take good care of her" that sounds like
something a boyfriend would say.

355
00:28:10,374 --> 00:28:11,406
And who are you?

356
00:28:12,367 --> 00:28:14,663
Don't tell me this office has two bosses.

357
00:28:15,786 --> 00:28:18,951
Oh, I'm Thee's older brother, not the boss.

358
00:28:21,715 --> 00:28:24,290
I'm just here, trying to win her over.

359
00:28:24,290 --> 00:28:25,585
Win her over?

360
00:28:25,585 --> 00:28:27,991
Dad, can you lower your voice?

361
00:28:30,185 --> 00:28:32,389
They're both competing to win her, huh?

362
00:28:32,389 --> 00:28:34,124
Who should we choose?

363
00:28:49,297 --> 00:28:50,503
Well, I'll go now.

364
00:28:51,503 --> 00:28:53,663
Okay, drive safely.

365
00:29:04,287 --> 00:29:06,487
Are you going to keep your arms crossed
for much longer?

366
00:29:11,676 --> 00:29:13,215
I have something to talk to you about.

367
00:29:17,201 --> 00:29:19,550
Why do you have to worry about our status?

368
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:24,296
Or has your family found out about us
and doesn't like me?

369
00:29:26,175 --> 00:29:27,382
No one knows yet.

370
00:29:28,597 --> 00:29:31,198
But it's your family who won't accept me.

371
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:35,384
I think if the end result is going to be bad,
we shouldn't even start.

372
00:29:38,103 --> 00:29:39,138
I don't understand.

373
00:29:42,987 --> 00:29:44,869
Let's just say, stop bothering me.

374
00:29:46,032 --> 00:29:48,151
I don't see a future for the two of us.

375
00:29:55,895 --> 00:29:59,785
Don't make me feel uncomfortable to the point…
where I don't want to be near you anymore.

376
00:30:03,790 --> 00:30:05,682
Did I make you feel that uncomfortable?

377
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,516
Yes,

378
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:15,950
and I don't think
anyone will be okay with our situation.

379
00:30:33,675 --> 00:30:34,675
Okay,

380
00:30:38,004 --> 00:30:40,171
if you choose to trust others more than me,

381
00:30:41,397 --> 00:30:42,604
I'll step back.

382
00:30:45,235 --> 00:30:47,082
I won't bother you again.

383
00:31:32,982 --> 00:31:34,718
<i>Did I make the right decision?</i>

384
00:31:35,926 --> 00:31:38,119
<i>Why does it feel so bad seeing him like that?</i>

385
00:31:38,992 --> 00:31:40,187
<i>This is really bad.</i>

386
00:31:41,129 --> 00:31:43,637
<i>Why do I have to be in this situation?</i>

387
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,876
Okay, sure.

388
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:00,661
I just got to the office.
I'll check the emails for you right now.

389
00:32:01,744 --> 00:32:02,744
Absolutely.

390
00:32:04,374 --> 00:32:06,930
Prim, come look at this!

391
00:32:14,729 --> 00:32:18,889
<i>Thank you for the flowers you send every day.
Thee is the sweetest in the world.</i>

392
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:25,260
Sending flowers every day like this
looks like they are really in love!

393
00:32:37,527 --> 00:32:39,367
You two, follow me into the room.

394
00:32:40,888 --> 00:32:41,888
Sure.

395
00:32:57,501 --> 00:33:01,763
Prim, do you see this?
This is clearly Jinny World!

396
00:33:12,763 --> 00:33:14,017
What work do we have today?

397
00:33:15,872 --> 00:33:18,997
In an hour, there's a video call
with the branch in Vietnam.

398
00:33:18,997 --> 00:33:20,897
Then a meeting with the marketing department.

399
00:33:20,897 --> 00:33:22,463
At 2 PM, a discussion with the fund manager.

400
00:33:22,463 --> 00:33:24,917
And at 4 PM, a meeting with Mr. Pat.

401
00:33:24,917 --> 00:33:26,284
After that, Boss will be free.

402
00:33:27,225 --> 00:33:28,444
Perfect!

403
00:33:28,444 --> 00:33:30,293
You've gotten much better, Secretary Mind.

404
00:33:30,293 --> 00:33:32,502
I think you'll be able to handle
the work on your own from now on.

405
00:33:32,502 --> 00:33:33,816
Thank you!

406
00:33:33,816 --> 00:33:36,949
It's really thanks to Prim,
for training me so well.

407
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:40,133
Not really, a person can be great on their own.

408
00:33:40,133 --> 00:33:41,833
It's not really because of others.

409
00:33:44,849 --> 00:33:45,849
Secretary Mind,

410
00:33:46,473 --> 00:33:49,322
please make a dinner reservation for 6 PM
today for me and Jinny.

411
00:33:49,322 --> 00:33:52,315
I'd like a very romantic restaurant, please.

412
00:33:52,315 --> 00:33:53,628
Got it.

413
00:33:53,628 --> 00:33:54,628
Secretary Prim!

414
00:33:55,192 --> 00:33:56,194
Yes?

415
00:33:56,194 --> 00:33:59,128
Could you order a bouquet of flowers
to be sent to Jinny for me tomorrow?

416
00:34:01,023 --> 00:34:04,562
Not just tomorrow, but every day after that.

417
00:34:07,434 --> 00:34:09,174
Yes, I'll take care of that, sir.

418
00:34:10,670 --> 00:34:13,192
That's all for now. You two can leave.

419
00:34:13,192 --> 00:34:15,426
I'll call Jinny now.

420
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:27,991
Hello, Jinny? It's me. Where are you?

421
00:34:28,827 --> 00:34:29,917
It's me, Thee.

422
00:34:31,598 --> 00:34:32,631
Where are you?

423
00:34:33,807 --> 00:34:36,611
Oh, you miss me? I miss you too.

424
00:34:37,981 --> 00:34:39,601
See you tonight.

425
00:34:49,559 --> 00:34:51,759
Why doesn't it feel fun to tease her?

426
00:35:13,383 --> 00:35:14,939
What's the point of all this?

427
00:35:17,886 --> 00:35:21,410
To make Prim see,
and when she sees, she'll get jealous.

428
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,436
If Prim gets jealous, she'll realize that
no matter what, she still loves me.

429
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:27,196
Then she'll stop trying to distance herself.

430
00:35:27,196 --> 00:35:28,951
How's that for a plan?

431
00:35:29,970 --> 00:35:32,006
- Worst plan ever.
- Oh?

432
00:35:32,006 --> 00:35:34,435
I've tried your method before, you know.

433
00:35:34,435 --> 00:35:35,953
Do you know what the result was?

434
00:35:37,843 --> 00:35:43,610
Nampan, make it look natural. Let's
make my wife so jealous that she goes crazy.

435
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:47,374
Got it, Nampan drama-style coming right up!

436
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:54,743
Hey, there she is. Look, my wife!

437
00:36:30,669 --> 00:36:31,865
Why isn't she jealous? Or

438
00:36:32,982 --> 00:36:35,072
is she too old to see it?

439
00:36:41,849 --> 00:36:44,090
You're dead!

440
00:37:02,207 --> 00:37:03,229
Hello,

441
00:37:04,995 --> 00:37:06,170
I'm not available.

442
00:37:07,503 --> 00:37:10,849
Got hit by a car. Yeah.

443
00:37:13,745 --> 00:37:16,509
I thought I was going to my next life!

444
00:37:18,047 --> 00:37:20,920
Hey, about love,

445
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,386
you can't just pretend, alright?

446
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:26,624
I've already been through this and
I don't want you to end up like me.

447
00:37:27,937 --> 00:37:29,133
So, what should I do?

448
00:37:31,548 --> 00:37:34,031
You should go apologize and talk to her calmly,

449
00:37:34,569 --> 00:37:35,973
or do you want me to come with you?

450
00:37:36,486 --> 00:37:38,563
No need, I'll handle it myself.

451
00:37:39,277 --> 00:37:41,904
I started this, so I have to fix it, right?

452
00:37:42,515 --> 00:37:43,515
Right.

453
00:37:46,367 --> 00:37:47,696
Okay.

454
00:37:47,696 --> 00:37:48,696
Wait!

455
00:37:50,273 --> 00:37:51,292
Don't stop me.

456
00:37:52,206 --> 00:37:54,055
I'm going anyway.

457
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:55,973
My golf club is expensive.

458
00:37:57,002 --> 00:37:59,330
Please, give it back to me.

459
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:07,183
You're not being careful with it.

460
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:22,982
What are you reading, son?

461
00:38:22,982 --> 00:38:25,787
Is it that interesting? Let me borrow it.

462
00:38:26,499 --> 00:38:28,428
It's not a book, Mom. It's a diary.

463
00:38:29,598 --> 00:38:30,712
A diary?

464
00:38:31,502 --> 00:38:34,249
It's the diary of a girl
who was kidnapped along with me.

465
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:38,667
Kidnapped?

466
00:38:39,335 --> 00:38:41,720
The day I was kidnapped,

467
00:38:41,720 --> 00:38:44,357
there was another girl who was taken with me.

468
00:38:45,330 --> 00:38:47,011
I wasn't the only one in that house.

469
00:38:47,855 --> 00:38:51,170
We were locked up together
and escaped together.

470
00:38:51,170 --> 00:38:53,052
Well, that's impossible, son.

471
00:38:53,771 --> 00:38:55,170
You escaped alone.

472
00:38:55,170 --> 00:38:57,044
The police saw you alone.

473
00:39:00,434 --> 00:39:01,434
Is that so?

474
00:39:04,675 --> 00:39:08,154
I don't know who told you this story,

475
00:39:08,734 --> 00:39:09,871
and what about the diary?

476
00:39:10,527 --> 00:39:14,379
We don't even know the person.
Are they trying to deceive you?

477
00:39:16,257 --> 00:39:20,837
They're not deceiving me, Mom.
You know her well, and you're close to her.

478
00:39:23,082 --> 00:39:24,082
Who's that?

479
00:39:27,103 --> 00:39:28,103
She is Prim.

480
00:39:48,267 --> 00:39:49,653
Hello, Khun Chonlada.

481
00:39:50,362 --> 00:39:53,632
Prim, come to my house.

482
00:39:53,632 --> 00:39:55,982
I have something important
to talk to you about.

483
00:40:00,578 --> 00:40:02,458
Is this true?

484
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:05,880
Yes.

485
00:40:06,533 --> 00:40:08,664
Please tell me about that day.

486
00:40:11,537 --> 00:40:15,245
Back then, I was still a child,
so I don't remember much.

487
00:40:16,423 --> 00:40:17,639
I only remember that…

488
00:40:19,548 --> 00:40:21,741
when I was kidnapped,

489
00:40:22,921 --> 00:40:25,734
there was a boy who was captured
in that house too.

490
00:40:30,982 --> 00:40:35,484
I saw him tied up, sitting in the corner
of the room before I was taken.

491
00:40:37,321 --> 00:40:39,201
And after we managed to escape,

492
00:40:39,788 --> 00:40:41,520
He took me home.

493
00:40:42,441 --> 00:40:44,606
He said he was going
to report it to the police first.

494
00:40:45,791 --> 00:40:47,647
He also promised me that…

495
00:40:48,394 --> 00:40:50,517
he would visit me again if he had the chance.

496
00:40:51,831 --> 00:40:55,281
And… back then, when you were taken,

497
00:40:55,858 --> 00:41:00,794
Was my little piggy very scared? How was he?

498
00:41:02,421 --> 00:41:03,524
Little piggy?

499
00:41:04,629 --> 00:41:05,629
Oh.

500
00:41:06,582 --> 00:41:08,759
I mean Tham.

501
00:41:10,037 --> 00:41:12,473
When he was little, I used to call him that.

502
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:16,784
Oh, my son,

503
00:41:16,784 --> 00:41:21,719
whenever he's exposed to dust
or in very hot weather, he gets hives.

504
00:41:22,322 --> 00:41:25,657
As far as I remember, he was okay.

505
00:41:27,457 --> 00:41:29,457
That day, he wore a prince costume,

506
00:41:30,171 --> 00:41:31,706
so I called him "Prince".

507
00:41:35,739 --> 00:41:38,599
The prince costume, that one?

508
00:41:42,049 --> 00:41:44,075
There was a fancy dress event at school,

509
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:48,434
so I had a designer friend
create it specially for him.

510
00:41:50,449 --> 00:41:53,442
My son loved wearing that outfit so much.

511
00:41:54,766 --> 00:41:55,781
Mrs. Chonlada,

512
00:41:59,754 --> 00:42:02,296
I might have pried a little,

513
00:42:02,296 --> 00:42:07,432
but I heard that
Mr. Tham lost his childhood memories,

514
00:42:07,432 --> 00:42:10,411
especially the events of the kidnapping.

515
00:42:11,489 --> 00:42:12,613
What happened?

516
00:42:15,817 --> 00:42:19,975
After that event,
everyone in the house became very stressed.

517
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,075
Then one day,

518
00:42:23,080 --> 00:42:25,549
Tham fainted suddenly.

519
00:42:27,091 --> 00:42:30,113
But when he woke up,
he couldn't remember anything anymore.

520
00:42:31,035 --> 00:42:32,035
Is that so?

521
00:42:33,805 --> 00:42:34,823
That's strange.

522
00:42:35,686 --> 00:42:37,019
Yes, it's strange.

523
00:42:39,220 --> 00:42:41,874
But anyway, everything has passed now.

524
00:42:43,994 --> 00:42:49,065
Still, I really want to thank you,
for being with Thee…

525
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:52,620
I mean, being with Tham.

526
00:42:58,450 --> 00:42:59,879
Oh, Prim.

527
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,808
Why didn't you call me when you came here?

528
00:43:10,095 --> 00:43:11,100
This way, please.

529
00:43:16,141 --> 00:43:19,749
Wait a minute, is it another hives outbreak?

530
00:43:21,156 --> 00:43:23,986
I think you should go rest in the house.
I can go by myself.

531
00:43:25,500 --> 00:43:26,501
What hives?

532
00:43:27,448 --> 00:43:29,950
Well, when you're exposed
to hot weather or dust,

533
00:43:29,950 --> 00:43:32,181
you tend to get hives, right?

534
00:43:34,130 --> 00:43:36,049
Oh, this one?

535
00:43:36,935 --> 00:43:41,654
I was reading in the garden, and an ant bit me,
so I scratched it, and it turned red.

536
00:43:43,576 --> 00:43:45,744
I've never had hives before in my life.

537
00:43:47,883 --> 00:43:49,214
<i>My son,</i>

538
00:43:49,214 --> 00:43:54,663
<i>whenever he's exposed to dust
or in very hot weather, he gets hives.</i>

539
00:43:54,663 --> 00:43:57,738
<i>When I'm in hot weather
or exposed to dust or smoke,</i>

540
00:43:58,691 --> 00:43:59,971
<i>my skin tends to itch like this.</i>

541
00:44:06,053 --> 00:44:08,603
Thanks a lot for the ride. Drive safely.

542
00:44:09,469 --> 00:44:10,469
Alright.

543
00:44:38,770 --> 00:44:39,770
What's going on?

544
00:44:40,863 --> 00:44:44,649
I read Prim's diary. She was with me that day.

545
00:44:44,649 --> 00:44:46,434
We went through bad things together.

546
00:44:47,536 --> 00:44:49,250
I was Prim's first love.

547
00:44:50,318 --> 00:44:51,496
<i>Prim is my partner.</i>

548
00:45:01,244 --> 00:45:02,244
Are you sure?

549
00:45:04,449 --> 00:45:06,441
I know everything from that diary.

550
00:45:06,441 --> 00:45:08,097
Even mother knows about it now.

551
00:45:08,622 --> 00:45:10,170
<i>And I also asked Prim by myself.</i>

552
00:45:12,949 --> 00:45:14,095
Did Prim meet you at home?

553
00:45:15,448 --> 00:45:17,072
<i>Tham? Hello?</i>

554
00:45:28,818 --> 00:45:29,818
Sir.

555
00:45:31,097 --> 00:45:34,028
Sir, don't forget
you have a dinner date with Jinny today.

556
00:45:34,028 --> 00:45:36,497
I have already informed Yong
to prepare the car for you.

557
00:45:39,388 --> 00:45:40,388
Can I not go?

558
00:45:41,001 --> 00:45:43,664
But I have already confirmed with Jinny, sir.

559
00:45:57,102 --> 00:45:58,102
What?

560
00:46:18,556 --> 00:46:22,285
<i>Is the prince really not coming to see me?</i>

561
00:46:22,285 --> 00:46:24,930
<i>Today I'm moving out, you know.</i>

562
00:46:24,930 --> 00:46:27,074
<i>Where's the promise to come?</i>

563
00:46:27,956 --> 00:46:31,626
<i>The prince is a liar. The prince is cruel.</i>

564
00:46:31,626 --> 00:46:33,834
I don't love the prince anymore.

565
00:46:37,973 --> 00:46:39,048
Who told you to read?

566
00:46:42,191 --> 00:46:45,526
Thanks for making me meet Prim again.

567
00:46:47,885 --> 00:46:49,291
It's because you left me that day.

568
00:46:50,311 --> 00:46:52,095
And then you hired Prim to be a secretary,

569
00:46:53,470 --> 00:46:54,822
so I got to meet her again.

570
00:46:58,076 --> 00:46:59,076
Okay,

571
00:47:00,282 --> 00:47:02,112
so you can keep thanking me forever.

572
00:47:03,181 --> 00:47:05,527
Because Prim will be by my side
for the rest of her life.

573
00:47:08,891 --> 00:47:09,891
Alright,

574
00:47:11,456 --> 00:47:14,353
then let's see
who will have a chance to be her side.

575
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:25,250
Yes, Dad.

576
00:47:27,090 --> 00:47:28,130
What did you say?

577
00:47:28,130 --> 00:47:29,655
You invite me to eat mangoes at home?

578
00:47:44,836 --> 00:47:46,988
Wait, looking at you,

579
00:47:46,988 --> 00:47:49,045
you haven't cleared things up
with Preem yet, right?

580
00:47:50,446 --> 00:47:51,446
Yeah.

581
00:47:52,156 --> 00:47:53,156
Why?

582
00:47:54,849 --> 00:47:57,508
It's nothing, just that I haven't met her yet.

583
00:47:57,508 --> 00:48:00,488
When I do, I don't know what to say,
what to talk about, or what to do.

584
00:48:01,795 --> 00:48:02,795
Got it.

585
00:48:03,443 --> 00:48:06,428
I never thought I'd come to this point.

586
00:48:07,188 --> 00:48:09,483
But I'll do it for you.

587
00:48:15,677 --> 00:48:16,677
Hey, Pat.

588
00:48:20,090 --> 00:48:21,657
You don't really need to do this.

589
00:48:22,563 --> 00:48:23,563
In pink?

590
00:48:25,497 --> 00:48:27,050
What are you doing?

591
00:48:27,050 --> 00:48:30,254
I'm trying to show you what you need to do.

592
00:48:31,094 --> 00:48:33,410
You want me to strip in front of Prim

593
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:36,185
to shock her with my body,
and then she'll start talking to me like this?

594
00:48:36,185 --> 00:48:40,216
No, that's not what I meant.
What I'm trying to convey is…

595
00:48:41,773 --> 00:48:45,906
Excuse me, I'll leave now!

596
00:48:47,981 --> 00:48:48,981
Again?

597
00:48:49,712 --> 00:48:52,348
I messed up again, didn't I?

598
00:48:52,980 --> 00:48:54,012
This time is the worst.

599
00:48:55,429 --> 00:48:57,419
Oh, let's put this aside for now.

600
00:48:58,569 --> 00:49:01,404
And come back to our topic about undressing.

601
00:49:01,404 --> 00:49:03,364
Wait, I mean… about taking off clothes.

602
00:49:04,699 --> 00:49:07,263
Do you know what love is?

603
00:49:08,003 --> 00:49:10,406
Love is about shedding layers

604
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:12,788
and standing bare in front of each other.

605
00:49:13,534 --> 00:49:17,697
Do you know that you two need to
confront each other

606
00:49:17,697 --> 00:49:19,722
and be completely honest?

607
00:49:19,722 --> 00:49:22,830
Whatever you're thinking and feeling,
you have to say it out loud.

608
00:49:24,304 --> 00:49:27,090
If you don't want her
to distance herself from you,

609
00:49:27,090 --> 00:49:30,532
you have to explain your feelings clearly.

610
00:49:31,130 --> 00:49:32,680
Make her understand.

611
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,663
Clear things up.
Let her know exactly how you feel.

612
00:49:35,663 --> 00:49:38,295
No more sarcasm, no more playing games,

613
00:49:38,295 --> 00:49:39,789
no more testing each other.

614
00:49:40,660 --> 00:49:41,660
You know?

615
00:49:42,599 --> 00:49:45,239
I still don't really get it,
but can you put some clothes on first?

616
00:49:46,526 --> 00:49:49,004
I've done all this,
and you still don't understand?

617
00:49:49,941 --> 00:49:52,295
What more do you want me to do? Come on.

618
00:49:52,885 --> 00:49:55,130
Hey, what are you doing, Pat?

619
00:49:55,130 --> 00:49:57,325
Secretary Prim, I need to talk to you.

620
00:49:57,325 --> 00:49:58,703
Come to my house right now.

621
00:49:59,417 --> 00:50:02,832
Alright, I've opened the game for you,
the rest is up to you.

622
00:50:05,370 --> 00:50:06,920
You! Pat!

623
00:50:06,920 --> 00:50:12,035
And remember this:
Shed your layers! Shed your layers!

624
00:50:12,035 --> 00:50:15,210
That's all you need to think about
Shed your layers. Naked.

625
00:50:49,408 --> 00:50:51,122
Don't you want to eat anything, Jin?

626
00:50:53,123 --> 00:50:54,123
Not hungry.

627
00:50:55,581 --> 00:50:57,811
Then I'll take everything, okay?

628
00:51:02,755 --> 00:51:05,424
With an appetite like this,
you're not ordering to go?

629
00:51:06,261 --> 00:51:07,261
Can I?

630
00:51:08,638 --> 00:51:09,681
Excuse me.

631
00:51:11,409 --> 00:51:13,410
Two sets of these please.

632
00:51:13,410 --> 00:51:14,929
- I'll take it to go.
- Sure.

633
00:51:14,929 --> 00:51:15,929
Thank you.

634
00:51:21,823 --> 00:51:23,427
Why did I dress so nicely today?

635
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,752
Prim… Well, I mean…

636
00:51:34,135 --> 00:51:36,082
I want to tell you that…

637
00:51:41,371 --> 00:51:42,537
Why are you here so early?

638
00:51:43,804 --> 00:51:45,837
Is something wrong, Boss?

639
00:51:45,837 --> 00:51:47,190
Are you okay?

640
00:51:48,499 --> 00:51:50,299
I have something I want to talk to you about,

641
00:51:51,392 --> 00:51:53,276
and I want to clear things up with you as well.

642
00:51:55,244 --> 00:51:57,600
I have something
I want to clear up with you too.

643
00:52:02,169 --> 00:52:03,269
Then you go first.

644
00:52:08,736 --> 00:52:10,181
I feel uneasy.

645
00:52:11,636 --> 00:52:13,708
I know something's going on with you today.

646
00:52:14,966 --> 00:52:18,918
It might be because I was too harsh
with you that day…

647
00:52:19,740 --> 00:52:21,552
About your family…

648
00:52:27,370 --> 00:52:28,370
That's right.

649
00:52:31,411 --> 00:52:33,171
But I want to tell you that about my family…

650
00:52:33,871 --> 00:52:36,155
I don't care whether they like you or not.

651
00:52:36,959 --> 00:52:39,130
No one can order or force me,

652
00:52:40,329 --> 00:52:41,973
especially when it comes to my heart.

653
00:52:46,143 --> 00:52:47,420
I won't sulk anymore,

654
00:52:48,630 --> 00:52:50,208
and I'll stop being sarcasm to you.

655
00:52:53,459 --> 00:52:57,682
I just want you… not to be distant from me.

656
00:53:00,001 --> 00:53:02,049
And could you please stop pushing me away?

657
00:53:08,043 --> 00:53:09,043
Okay,

658
00:53:10,098 --> 00:53:13,753
I understand, and I won't do that anymore.

659
00:53:16,871 --> 00:53:17,871
Let's make up, okay?

660
00:53:30,581 --> 00:53:33,042
Now, you can answer my question, right?

661
00:53:35,494 --> 00:53:36,495
Answer what question?

662
00:53:39,325 --> 00:53:41,242
Whether we can be together or not.

663
00:53:46,885 --> 00:53:48,078
- Dad.
- Yeah?

664
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:52,539
When you were about to start dating mom…

665
00:53:53,974 --> 00:53:56,905
How did you know
you were in love with mom at that time?

666
00:53:56,905 --> 00:53:59,994
Oh, why are you
asking about this all of a sudden?

667
00:54:00,561 --> 00:54:01,647
I just want to know.

668
00:54:03,922 --> 00:54:06,930
Well… I'm not sure,
but during that time, I felt like…

669
00:54:08,152 --> 00:54:09,900
I was thinking about your mom all the time.

670
00:54:10,834 --> 00:54:14,717
Whether eating, sleeping, or pooping,
your mother's face always appears.

671
00:54:15,441 --> 00:54:19,905
And if anyone tried to get close to her,
I just wanted to punch them in the face.

672
00:54:19,905 --> 00:54:22,081
Oh, what a pleasant time.

673
00:54:24,018 --> 00:54:26,929
But there's one important thing, I feel like…

674
00:54:28,759 --> 00:54:30,559
I want to stay with her until I get old.

675
00:54:33,402 --> 00:54:35,387
You want to stay together until you're old?

676
00:54:35,387 --> 00:54:36,387
Right.

677
00:54:36,998 --> 00:54:38,061
Have you ever noticed that

678
00:54:39,165 --> 00:54:42,662
when new couples get together,

679
00:54:45,114 --> 00:54:50,233
they go through a honeymoon phase,
buying gifts, flowers, and all that stuff?

680
00:54:50,906 --> 00:54:54,467
It's just fleeting desire, something momentary.

681
00:54:55,054 --> 00:54:56,054
It's not lasting.

682
00:54:56,987 --> 00:54:58,417
But when you find someone…

683
00:54:59,374 --> 00:55:01,492
you want to spend your life with,
until you grow old.

684
00:55:03,393 --> 00:55:04,590
I think that's love.

685
00:55:09,171 --> 00:55:11,973
So, at the time when you realize you loved mom,

686
00:55:12,519 --> 00:55:13,542
Did you hit on mom?

687
00:55:13,542 --> 00:55:16,414
Why waste time flirting?
I just grabbed her right away.

688
00:55:17,963 --> 00:55:18,963
Just kidding!

689
00:55:19,876 --> 00:55:22,968
I just asked her to marry me
like a normal person.

690
00:55:23,856 --> 00:55:27,147
But some of my friends said,
"Why rush to propose?"

691
00:55:27,147 --> 00:55:30,150
And I told them,
if we've found someone we really love,

692
00:55:30,896 --> 00:55:34,162
then why waste time
not living our life with them? Right?

693
00:55:44,021 --> 00:55:45,021
So what do you say?

694
00:55:46,162 --> 00:55:48,291
Will you be with me?

695
00:56:09,369 --> 00:56:10,954
I'm sorry for the late response,

696
00:56:12,527 --> 00:56:14,033
but here is my answer.

00:56:58,089 --> 00:57:02,439
<i>♫ The moment of falling in love
Feels just like this ♫</i>

698
00:57:02,439 --> 00:57:06,372
<i>♫ That split second when I saw you ♫</i>

699
00:57:06,372 --> 00:57:10,228
<i>♫ The way you smiled, the way you blushed ♫</i>

700
00:57:10,228 --> 00:57:13,409
<i>♫ It felt like the world slowed down ♫</i>

701
00:57:13,409 --> 00:57:17,881
<i>♫ The moment of falling in love
Feels just like this ♫</i>

702
00:57:17,881 --> 00:57:21,705
<i>♫ That fleeting instant when we met ♫</i>

703
00:57:21,705 --> 00:57:25,495
<i>♫ The moment our eyes met,
the moment we connected ♫</i>

704
00:57:25,495 --> 00:57:28,780
<i>♫ I wish I could freeze this time forever ♫</i>

705
00:57:28,780 --> 00:57:32,900
<i>♫ In this moment, I love you ♫</i>

706
00:57:36,385 --> 00:57:41,229
<i>♫ In this moment, I love you ♫</i>

707
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,849
I already know that my love is one-sided.

708
00:57:45,849 --> 00:57:47,873
I think it's best if I step back with dignity.

709
00:57:47,873 --> 00:57:51,987
If I'm not your prince,
will you change your mind and hate me instead?

710
00:57:51,987 --> 00:57:53,939
In the abandoned house
where I was kept captive,

711
00:57:53,939 --> 00:57:55,777
I found another girl in that house.

712
00:57:55,777 --> 00:57:57,362
She's my first love.

713
00:57:57,362 --> 00:57:59,708
I didn't mean to make you uncomfortable.

714
00:57:59,708 --> 00:58:02,581
I just wanted you to know my feelings.

715
00:58:02,581 --> 00:58:04,461
When are you going to stop talking about this?

716
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:08,308
Let's just say that from now on,
you can't come to see Prim ever again.
