1
00:01:05,172 --> 00:01:07,943
Father, I'd like to let you know that
Prim and I are together now.

2
00:01:07,943 --> 00:01:09,240
I ask for permission to take care of Prim.

3
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:11,471
I disapprove of this relationship.

4
00:01:11,471 --> 00:01:14,539
But why don't you like him?
He's a good person, you know?

5
00:01:14,539 --> 00:01:15,675
No reason.

6
00:01:15,675 --> 00:01:19,898
It's good to have the future daughter-in-law
and the secretary meet.

7
00:01:19,898 --> 00:01:23,083
Alice, have you read Tham's work?

8
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,031
- His pen name is 'Morpheus'.
- Really?

9
00:01:26,031 --> 00:01:29,437
Don't think I don't know
you've been cheering for Thee and Prim.

10
00:01:29,437 --> 00:01:33,537
If you truly love your child, you'd want him
to succeed in both business and love.

11
00:01:33,537 --> 00:01:37,327
So, the rumor that
you're dating the boss is true?

12
00:01:37,327 --> 00:01:39,906
I guess I need to clear everything up
once and for all.

13
00:01:39,906 --> 00:01:42,063
I want to announce to everyone that…

14
00:01:42,063 --> 00:01:44,757
I love Prim.

15
00:01:46,120 --> 00:01:48,935
- Wait, Prim.
- Come here, Boss.

16
00:01:50,816 --> 00:01:52,016
What is this?

17
00:01:52,743 --> 00:01:54,917
If it were anyone else,
they'd be grinning from ear to ear by now.

18
00:01:54,917 --> 00:01:57,781
I put in the effort to do it.
Why are you making this face?

19
00:01:57,781 --> 00:01:59,307
It's you, Boss.

20
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:01,382
Why are you doing things
without thinking like this?

21
00:02:01,382 --> 00:02:04,046
I did think about it. I thought really hard.

22
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:07,249
I took a long time to figure out
how to confess my love to you…

23
00:02:07,249 --> 00:02:08,349
in the coolest way.

24
00:02:09,344 --> 00:02:11,839
I'm serious. I'm not joking.

25
00:02:13,014 --> 00:02:14,114
I'm serious too.

26
00:02:14,924 --> 00:02:17,099
I don't want them to misunderstand you.

27
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,419
I did it because I wanted to protect you.

28
00:02:21,121 --> 00:02:22,221
I know.

29
00:02:23,018 --> 00:02:25,239
I want to protect you too, Boss.

30
00:02:25,239 --> 00:02:28,116
I don't want to be the reason
your reputation is damaged.

31
00:02:28,116 --> 00:02:30,171
Because you had a girlfriend
as his own secretary

32
00:02:31,230 --> 00:02:32,324
I don't care anyway.

33
00:02:32,324 --> 00:02:33,817
But I do care.

34
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,548
Hey, look.

35
00:02:49,354 --> 00:02:50,721
How about this?

36
00:02:50,721 --> 00:02:53,869
If you're still worried,
take a break for a few days.

37
00:02:54,994 --> 00:02:56,094
A week, even.

38
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:58,654
Or better yet, a month.

39
00:02:59,858 --> 00:03:01,968
I'll handle everything at the company.

40
00:03:01,968 --> 00:03:05,023
Anyone gossiping about you, I'll fire them.

41
00:03:05,023 --> 00:03:07,392
If they keep gossiping,
I'll send Yong to take care of them.

42
00:03:07,932 --> 00:03:09,742
Boss, please don't do that!

43
00:03:09,742 --> 00:03:12,577
I'm serious.
Yong is a former soldier, you know.

44
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:14,146
Look.

45
00:03:16,793 --> 00:03:17,793
How's that?

46
00:03:21,211 --> 00:03:23,286
I think it's better if you stay put.

47
00:03:23,286 --> 00:03:25,457
Otherwise,
things will just get even more chaotic.

48
00:03:26,224 --> 00:03:29,037
Alright, whatever makes you feel comfortable.

49
00:03:30,594 --> 00:03:31,964
But just so you know,

50
00:03:31,964 --> 00:03:35,177
no matter what happens,
I'll never let go of you.

51
00:03:44,416 --> 00:03:46,500
But really,
can't we send Yong to take care of it?

52
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,921
Boss!

53
00:03:47,921 --> 00:03:49,927
From afar, just like a sniper.

54
00:03:49,927 --> 00:03:51,697
- No one will see.
- That's enough!

55
00:03:56,852 --> 00:03:58,627
I've been in the hospital a long time.

56
00:03:58,627 --> 00:04:00,140
Finally back home to be a rocker.

57
00:04:01,006 --> 00:04:02,454
What a relief, huh?

58
00:04:05,321 --> 00:04:06,321
I'm at ease now.

59
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:08,218
- Dad!
- Yeah?

60
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:10,624
- Put your hands together.
- Again?

61
00:04:12,705 --> 00:04:15,660
From now on,
you're going to take care of your health.

62
00:04:15,660 --> 00:04:17,059
Be mindful of your diet.

63
00:04:17,059 --> 00:04:18,980
Not drinking. Not drinking beer.

64
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:21,221
Follow the doctor's advice strictly.

65
00:04:21,221 --> 00:04:23,815
Don't act like a teenager
and ignore your age like that again.

66
00:04:23,815 --> 00:04:24,942
Do you understand?

67
00:04:25,908 --> 00:04:27,957
I got it. Understood.

68
00:04:27,957 --> 00:04:30,345
My respectable children.

69
00:04:30,345 --> 00:04:33,839
I'll make a list of what you need to eat
and how to exercise.

70
00:04:33,839 --> 00:04:36,208
Okay, I'll help keep an eye on him.

71
00:04:36,208 --> 00:04:38,344
Oh no, don't bother, Prim.

72
00:04:38,344 --> 00:04:40,219
You're already busy enough with work.

73
00:04:40,219 --> 00:04:41,573
I can handle it.

74
00:04:41,573 --> 00:04:43,942
We don't even sleep in the same house,
so it's fine. I'll manage.

75
00:04:43,942 --> 00:04:45,287
- Yeah.
- Right?

76
00:04:46,556 --> 00:04:47,892
I'm moving back home.

77
00:04:47,892 --> 00:04:48,892
What?

78
00:04:52,900 --> 00:04:54,040
Here, look.

79
00:04:54,700 --> 00:04:57,659
Does this mean you're really quitting, Huh?

80
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,850
What's going on?

81
00:04:58,850 --> 00:05:00,103
Did you have a fight with the Boss?

82
00:05:00,103 --> 00:05:01,196
It's not like that.

83
00:05:01,196 --> 00:05:02,713
Huh? Then what is it?

84
00:05:02,713 --> 00:05:05,361
Hey, why don't you just talk to him properly?
Why are you fighting with him?

85
00:05:05,361 --> 00:05:06,673
He's so good to you!
Why are you acting like this?

86
00:05:06,673 --> 00:05:07,863
Just talk it out, okay?

87
00:05:07,863 --> 00:05:09,191
Look at you!

88
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:11,466
Back then, you were criticizing him non-stop.

89
00:05:11,466 --> 00:05:13,601
And now you've switched
to hashtag Boss Team, huh?

90
00:05:14,108 --> 00:05:15,464
Oh, right.

91
00:05:15,464 --> 00:05:19,669
Well, he's been so good to us, right?

92
00:05:19,669 --> 00:05:22,787
Does this mean
he's passed the test of Pare the Demon?

93
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,541
But he hasn't passed my test yet.

94
00:05:29,612 --> 00:05:30,612
For Dad,

95
00:05:31,584 --> 00:05:34,817
he's still just "the potential son-in-law
who hasn't been fully approved yet".

96
00:05:34,817 --> 00:05:36,261
That's all.

97
00:05:36,261 --> 00:05:38,562
The rest? He's got a bit more to prove.

98
00:05:39,369 --> 00:05:41,593
Oh, what a long title.

99
00:05:41,593 --> 00:05:43,452
And how much longer
does "a bit more" mean, huh?

100
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:44,819
About three thousand years.

101
00:05:44,819 --> 00:05:46,502
Oh…

102
00:05:46,502 --> 00:05:48,977
Prim's probably been reborn
a hundred times by then.

103
00:05:50,685 --> 00:05:54,600
Exactly. So to sum it up,
I've decided I'm moving back home.

104
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:56,654
That way, I can spend more time
taking care of Dad.

105
00:05:57,328 --> 00:06:01,095
I'm afraid Pear and Pround
will snatch up all the inheritance.

106
00:06:01,975 --> 00:06:03,366
Hey, everybody.

107
00:06:03,366 --> 00:06:05,299
You don't have to worry
about the inheritance, okay?

108
00:06:05,299 --> 00:06:07,774
Because I… only have debt.

109
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:11,405
Don't you ever get tired of
showing off about debt?

110
00:06:11,405 --> 00:06:13,596
Come on, Dad. Stop it.

111
00:06:25,484 --> 00:06:28,004
What are you cleaning at this hour for?

112
00:06:28,004 --> 00:06:29,723
Why not just take a shower and go to bed?

113
00:06:29,723 --> 00:06:30,824
You can finish it tomorrow.

114
00:06:31,966 --> 00:06:33,610
I'm finishing it tonight, Dad.

115
00:06:33,610 --> 00:06:35,104
The house is so dusty like this.

116
00:06:35,104 --> 00:06:37,276
Lucky you didn't get a lung disease.

117
00:06:48,098 --> 00:06:49,840
Hey, this album is still here?

118
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,508
Yeah, kept it in perfect condition.

119
00:06:58,165 --> 00:07:01,591
Pear was already cosplaying
as a flight attendant when she was a kid, huh?

120
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:03,866
And you liked cosplaying as a tour guide,

121
00:07:04,574 --> 00:07:07,565
doing nothing all day
but thinking about finding excuses to travel.

122
00:07:07,565 --> 00:07:12,166
And you said, "When I grow up,
I want to have my own tour company."

123
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:14,261
I still remember that one trip we went on,

124
00:07:14,261 --> 00:07:16,211
and you even charged me a guide fee, 20 baht!

125
00:07:17,086 --> 00:07:18,816
- Really?
- That's right.

126
00:07:22,253 --> 00:07:23,453
Wait a minute.

127
00:07:33,677 --> 00:07:34,912
Look at this.

128
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:37,994
Hey, my old diary is still here too.

129
00:07:43,876 --> 00:07:49,230
Today, Prim took Dad and Mom
to see the sunflowers.

130
00:07:49,810 --> 00:07:54,134
The sunflowers were fully bloomed,
smiling to welcome Prim.

131
00:07:55,257 --> 00:07:59,121
I smiled brightly, my smile shining
alongside the sunflowers.

132
00:07:59,121 --> 00:08:01,022
Everyone's smiling.

133
00:08:01,022 --> 00:08:03,537
When I grow up, I'll be a guide,

134
00:08:03,537 --> 00:08:06,419
and I'll take my parents traveling every day.

135
00:08:12,871 --> 00:08:14,073
Why are you smiling like that?

136
00:08:29,214 --> 00:08:32,291
Hey, Dad, this is a nice spot for photos,
an opening like this.

137
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:34,672
Let's take a picture here. This way.

138
00:08:34,672 --> 00:08:35,964
Take this too.

139
00:08:35,964 --> 00:08:37,054
- Oh?
- Okay.

140
00:08:37,054 --> 00:08:40,060
Here we go. One, two, three!

141
00:08:41,999 --> 00:08:43,246
- Oh?
- Water, Dad.

142
00:08:43,246 --> 00:08:44,556
- Excuse me.
- Huh?

143
00:08:44,556 --> 00:08:46,316
How to get to Wat Pho?

144
00:08:46,316 --> 00:08:48,485
Oh, I see. Do you mean Wat Pho?

145
00:08:48,485 --> 00:08:50,670
- Yes, Wat Pho.
- Yes, yes, Wat Pho!

146
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,082
Actually, We are going to Wat Pho.

147
00:08:53,082 --> 00:08:54,822
So you can follow us.

148
00:08:54,822 --> 00:08:56,343
- Oh, thank you.
- Thank you.

149
00:08:56,343 --> 00:08:57,437
Go, go, go, go.

150
00:09:13,832 --> 00:09:16,240
- Bye-bye! Thank you!
- Bye-bye! Thank you!

151
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:19,060
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!

152
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:20,813
If you want to come again, please don't come!

153
00:09:20,813 --> 00:09:22,367
Dad!

154
00:09:22,367 --> 00:09:24,057
I'm joking, just joking.

155
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:28,881
How is it, Prim?

156
00:09:28,881 --> 00:09:30,999
Today, you got to be the guide,
just like your dream.

157
00:09:32,339 --> 00:09:35,423
At first,
I thought I'd only be guiding you, Dad.

158
00:09:35,423 --> 00:09:37,056
- But it was fun, though.
- Yeah.

159
00:09:38,485 --> 00:09:39,513
- Dad.
- Yeah?

160
00:09:39,513 --> 00:09:41,830
Do you think I should quit and become a guide?

161
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:42,843
It's up to you.

162
00:09:43,511 --> 00:09:45,760
If you think it's good,
then I think it's good too.

163
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:47,779
I'll always be on your side for my whole life.

164
00:09:55,087 --> 00:09:56,087
Hello.

165
00:09:56,728 --> 00:09:58,223
Are you free today, Prim?

166
00:09:58,869 --> 00:10:00,056
Come talk to me for a bit.

167
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:03,531
Yes, sure.

168
00:10:04,462 --> 00:10:05,492
Hey, Dad!

169
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:06,683
Hello?

170
00:10:06,683 --> 00:10:08,849
Why are you calling my daughter for work, huh?

171
00:10:08,849 --> 00:10:10,958
Today, Prim's on leave. Don't you remember?

172
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,535
No, it's not the Boss.

173
00:10:12,535 --> 00:10:13,705
Who's there?

174
00:10:13,705 --> 00:10:17,889
It's the future rock star father-in-law,
the most handsome one in the country.

175

177

This future son-in-law
hasn't even been approved yet.

No, it's not the Boss!
It's the father, the father!

Are you telling me this is Wat Pho?

180

That way is Wat Arun.

- We don't even know if it's a girl or a boy.
- I have to buy it.

Okay, that's it for now.

That's why I have to
chase the divorce papers from you.

208

Whatever is happening between you and Thee,

209
00:12:46,574 --> 00:12:48,709
whether it's just rumors or the truth,

210
00:12:49,447 --> 00:12:51,837
it will only harm Thee's reputation.

212
00:12:58,021 --> 00:13:00,535
I'm planning to resign soon.

213
00:13:01,183 --> 00:13:03,058
Just resigning won't be enough.

214
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:06,672
Because now,
the family head knows about you and Thee.

215
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:09,953
If Thee doesn't break up with you,

216
00:13:09,953 --> 00:13:12,518
he will cut ties with Thee.

217
00:13:12,518 --> 00:13:14,037
Cutting ties?

218
00:13:14,751 --> 00:13:15,751
That's right.

219
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:19,596
You might think it's unnecessary
to make a big deal out of something small,

220
00:13:22,525 --> 00:13:25,496
But my family has always been like this.

221
00:13:30,552 --> 00:13:32,041
If Thee knows about this,

222
00:13:33,549 --> 00:13:37,624
he'll probably leave the company
and choose you instead.

223

I don't want to stand in the way of your love,

225

I don't want you
to have problems with your family.

has already approved my resignation.

A burden?
You've supported me so well all this time.

Don't you know how much I love you?

258

But your family
probably doesn't think the same way.

And love alone isn't enough.

260
00:17:33,672 --> 00:17:35,460

Prim is the one who is drunk!

352
00:26:26,394 --> 00:26:28,582
Cheers! Cheers! Cheers!

353
00:26:30,509 --> 00:26:33,406
Wow, you guys are really drunk, huh?

354
00:26:39,812 --> 00:26:42,572
You look just like the Boss!

355
00:26:43,525 --> 00:26:45,155
Doesn't he look like Boss?

356
00:26:45,155 --> 00:26:46,771
- Yes, yeah!
- He looks like him!

357
00:26:46,771 --> 00:26:49,486
Boss, hello!

358
00:26:52,247 --> 00:26:54,384
- Come sit here!
- Hey, sit here!

359
00:26:54,384 --> 00:26:56,422
Come sit here!

360
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,154
You're so handsome!

361
00:26:59,154 --> 00:27:00,501
Hey, come here!

362
00:27:00,501 --> 00:27:03,832
Oh wow, look at you, Bhum!

363
00:27:04,874 --> 00:27:07,140
Come here, come here!

364
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:10,779
Boss, how about a sip or two?

365
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:12,571
Oh, no, I can't. I drove here.

366
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:16,617
Not cool at all!

367
00:27:16,617 --> 00:27:19,284
No excuses, Boss!

368
00:27:19,284 --> 00:27:21,609
Just a sip or two. What's the big deal?

369
00:27:22,515 --> 00:27:24,380
- Hey, listen!
- What?

370
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,839
- Today…
- Yeah?

371
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:28,774
Boss isn't here as a boss.

372
00:27:29,893 --> 00:27:30,896
Boss!

373
00:27:30,896 --> 00:27:34,565
He's here as Prim's boyfriend, our friend!

374
00:27:35,438 --> 00:27:38,500
So today, don't call him "Boss".

375
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:40,882
Just call him "Thee".

376
00:27:41,699 --> 00:27:43,378
What's up, Thee?

377
00:27:43,378 --> 00:27:47,816
Thee!

378
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:51,134
I think you're all pretty drunk already.

379
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:52,817
Let me drive you guys home, okay?

380
00:27:54,675 --> 00:27:57,336
You're always wanting to leave!

381
00:27:57,336 --> 00:27:59,389
Thee, you're no fun at all!

382
00:27:59,389 --> 00:28:00,712
Thee!

383
00:28:00,712 --> 00:28:03,906
Since you're sitting here,
let me ask you straight up.

384
00:28:03,906 --> 00:28:05,686
So…

385
00:28:05,686 --> 00:28:07,228
Have you broken up with Prim or not?!

386
00:28:07,228 --> 00:28:08,994
- So?
- Huh?

387
00:28:10,445 --> 00:28:12,083
- Hey…
- Huh?

388
00:28:15,149 --> 00:28:17,302
Oh, no answer?

389
00:28:17,302 --> 00:28:20,432
So maybe you should…

390
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:22,151
propose instead!

391
00:28:23,295 --> 00:28:24,450
Have you proposed yet?

392
00:28:24,450 --> 00:28:25,737
If not…

393
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:26,915
Do it!

394
00:28:26,915 --> 00:28:32,819
- Do it! Do it!
- Do it! Do it!

395
00:28:32,819 --> 00:28:34,467
Oh, stop!

396
00:28:35,425 --> 00:28:37,929
There's no proposal happening

397
00:28:37,929 --> 00:28:40,082
because we've already broken up!

398
00:28:40,722 --> 00:28:44,291
Did you hear me?
If you didn't, I'll say it again.

399
00:28:44,291 --> 00:28:47,037
We've broken up!

400
00:28:50,307 --> 00:28:52,693
Thee! You're useless!

401
00:28:52,693 --> 00:28:53,958
Breaking up, huh?

402
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:57,057
They've broken up.

403
00:29:00,489 --> 00:29:03,197
- They broke up, no.
- No way!

404
00:29:03,197 --> 00:29:04,859
Hey, watch out!

405
00:29:07,508 --> 00:29:09,791
Why did you let yourself get this drunk, huh?

406
00:29:10,969 --> 00:29:13,312
- It's a rare occasion.
- Oh, no, no!

407
00:29:13,312 --> 00:29:14,632
Oh, Prim…

408
00:29:17,832 --> 00:29:19,423
When Boss used to drink while working,

409
00:29:19,423 --> 00:29:22,838
you'd drink alone and never invite me.

410
00:29:22,838 --> 00:29:26,834
Just left me to drive around. So boring.

411
00:29:29,593 --> 00:29:30,863
You didn't like that?

412
00:29:35,146 --> 00:29:36,880
Who said I didn't like you?

413
00:29:40,213 --> 00:29:41,339
I liked you a lot.

414
00:29:48,026 --> 00:29:49,240
What do you like about me?

415
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:57,399
This.

416
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:01,229
And this.

417
00:30:01,939 --> 00:30:04,126
And this.

418
00:30:06,173 --> 00:30:07,755
And I like this.

419
00:30:08,482 --> 00:30:10,404
I like everything about you!

420
00:30:11,312 --> 00:30:12,312
Perfect!

421
00:30:15,425 --> 00:30:17,785
If you like me this much,
then why did you break up with me?

422
00:30:33,078 --> 00:30:35,794
Who said I wanted to break up with you?

423
00:30:37,751 --> 00:30:40,950
I never wanted to break up with you.

424
00:30:42,738 --> 00:30:45,022
I miss you every day.

425
00:30:47,047 --> 00:30:49,328
I miss you so much!

426
00:31:05,905 --> 00:31:07,005
It's okay.

427
00:31:07,845 --> 00:31:09,133
I'm here.

428
00:31:10,792 --> 00:31:12,950
From now on, we'll love each other forever.

429
00:31:15,152 --> 00:31:16,911
You promised me.

430
00:31:17,932 --> 00:31:20,270
Don't leave me again.

431
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,500
Promise you.

432
00:31:24,451 --> 00:31:25,551
I promise.

433
00:31:52,851 --> 00:31:54,144
Let's go, come on.

434
00:31:56,152 --> 00:31:57,653
Walk slowly, okay?

435
00:31:57,653 --> 00:31:59,613
I can walk myself.

436
00:31:59,613 --> 00:32:01,322
Watch out, watch out!

437
00:32:09,245 --> 00:32:10,245
Yeah?

438
00:32:11,485 --> 00:32:13,716
Whose boyfriend is this, huh?

439
00:32:15,566 --> 00:32:18,355
It's my boyfriend, right?

440
00:32:18,355 --> 00:32:21,672
So cute!

441
00:32:23,855 --> 00:32:28,812
I want to be with you every day.

442
00:32:28,812 --> 00:32:34,516
I used to dream about waking up
to see you every day,

443
00:32:34,516 --> 00:32:37,806
sending you off to work,

444
00:32:37,806 --> 00:32:39,185
and then waiting for you to come home

445
00:32:39,185 --> 00:32:41,909
so we could eat instant noodles
together every day.

446
00:32:44,544 --> 00:32:47,126
Then I'll make that dream come true.

447
00:32:48,455 --> 00:32:51,336
But we have to get married first. So…

448
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:52,436
Let's get married.

449
00:32:53,269 --> 00:32:54,935
Okay.

450
00:32:54,935 --> 00:32:56,104
No objections, right?

451
00:32:58,225 --> 00:32:59,225
Objection!

452
00:33:06,227 --> 00:33:10,389
Oh? Prim! Prim!

453
00:33:19,668 --> 00:33:20,903
Perfect!

454
00:33:46,607 --> 00:33:47,607
Hey.

455
00:33:49,245 --> 00:33:51,898
Come with me. We need to talk.

456
00:34:04,770 --> 00:34:07,576
Did you ever hear about my eldest daughter?

457
00:34:10,092 --> 00:34:14,247
She once made the mistake of
marrying someone she worked with.

458
00:34:15,470 --> 00:34:16,963
In the end, they had to get divorced.

459
00:34:19,595 --> 00:34:22,712
I'm worried that
Prim might repeat her sister's mistake.

460
00:34:25,303 --> 00:34:27,110
I understand your concern.

461
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:28,905
But Prim and I…

462
00:34:28,905 --> 00:34:31,633
We've loved each other for a long time
and have a deep bond.

463
00:34:35,767 --> 00:34:36,914
The truth is…

464
00:34:37,690 --> 00:34:38,922
Prim and I…

465
00:34:40,792 --> 00:34:43,199
have been through
life-and-death situations together

466
00:34:44,219 --> 00:34:45,900
since we were five years old.

467
00:34:48,030 --> 00:34:49,270
Wait a minute.

468
00:34:49,270 --> 00:34:50,270
Don't tell me that…

469
00:34:51,069 --> 00:34:52,562
That's right.

470
00:34:52,562 --> 00:34:56,245
Prim and I were the two
who were kidnapped together.

471
00:34:58,440 --> 00:34:59,440
Oh, right.

472
00:35:00,918 --> 00:35:02,864
Prim never told me about this before.

473
00:35:04,945 --> 00:35:06,064
Back then, I…

474
00:35:07,720 --> 00:35:08,884
I was so scared.

475
00:35:11,509 --> 00:35:12,999
But because of Prim…

476
00:35:14,928 --> 00:35:16,349
she gave me the strength to fight.

477
00:35:17,684 --> 00:35:20,465
I just kept thinking that I had to survive

478
00:35:20,465 --> 00:35:23,760
and get Prim out of that abandoned house, too.

479
00:35:26,145 --> 00:35:29,005
Thank you for helping Prim get out.

480
00:35:30,806 --> 00:35:31,806
It's my pleasure.

481
00:35:32,410 --> 00:35:34,616
Even if we were kidnapped a hundred times,

482
00:35:34,616 --> 00:35:36,876
I'd get her out every single time.

483
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:39,808
Once is more than enough?

484
00:35:45,819 --> 00:35:47,852
As for the story you just told me,

485
00:35:48,765 --> 00:35:49,765
I can accept it.

486
00:35:52,592 --> 00:35:54,653
But about proposing to Prim…

487
00:35:56,837 --> 00:35:57,937
That's a different matter.

488
00:36:01,234 --> 00:36:05,198
Who proposes to a woman when she's drunk?

489
00:36:06,366 --> 00:36:08,140
You're clearly forcing her into it.

490
00:36:10,195 --> 00:36:12,459
You should propose to Prim properly,

491
00:36:13,087 --> 00:36:14,747
like a normal person,

492
00:36:16,419 --> 00:36:17,926
when she's fully conscious.

493
00:36:20,326 --> 00:36:21,326
Understood.

494
00:36:25,038 --> 00:36:26,038
Wait a second…

495
00:36:27,092 --> 00:36:28,289
Does this mean…

496
00:36:29,763 --> 00:36:30,846
You approve, Father?

497
00:36:31,968 --> 00:36:34,457
I wholeheartedly approve, if you can do it.

498
00:36:35,266 --> 00:36:36,756
I'd be more than happy to.

499
00:36:40,139 --> 00:36:42,819
- Thank you very much.
- Alright, let's raise our glasses and toast!

500
00:36:43,496 --> 00:36:45,276
Let's drink until we're flat on the floor!

501
00:36:46,211 --> 00:36:48,568
How's that going to work? We're drinking water.

502
00:36:48,568 --> 00:36:49,756
I drink for the vibe!

503
00:36:50,389 --> 00:36:52,238
My doctor told me not to drink alcohol now.

504
00:36:54,484 --> 00:36:55,680
- Okay?
- Sure.

505
00:37:19,126 --> 00:37:20,160
Dad.

506
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,960
- Yeah?
- Why are you sleeping here?

507
00:37:23,979 --> 00:37:25,767
I'm here to watch over the drunk girl.

508
00:37:25,767 --> 00:37:26,806
Who's drunk?

509
00:37:30,693 --> 00:37:34,323
You're all grown up,
and I still have to watch over you.

510
00:37:35,056 --> 00:37:36,056
Really?

511
00:37:36,602 --> 00:37:38,102
You good now?

512
00:37:38,102 --> 00:37:39,102
I'm going back to sleep.

513
00:37:46,706 --> 00:37:50,000
Cheers!

514
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,556
Looks just like Boss!

515
00:37:53,618 --> 00:37:55,244
Yes, Yeah.

516
00:37:55,244 --> 00:37:57,108
Boss, hello!

517
00:38:02,508 --> 00:38:03,761
Oh no, what have I done?

518
00:38:11,778 --> 00:38:13,418
Don't get drunk like this again, okay?

519
00:38:13,418 --> 00:38:15,544
We're back together now.

520
00:38:35,732 --> 00:38:37,292
If you've got something to say, say it.

521
00:38:41,101 --> 00:38:43,919
We're sorry, sir.

522
00:38:43,919 --> 00:38:46,524
- Sorry, Sir.
- Sorry, Sir.

523
00:38:46,524 --> 00:38:48,030
Well, last night,

524
00:38:48,624 --> 00:38:51,667
- we got a little drunk.
- Just a little.

525
00:38:51,667 --> 00:38:54,555
Not just a little, someone even called me…

526
00:38:55,142 --> 00:38:56,421
"You, Thee!"

527
00:38:58,036 --> 00:39:02,157
Who? Which one dared to call you that, sir?

528
00:39:02,157 --> 00:39:04,977
Let me slap them myself.

529
00:39:04,977 --> 00:39:06,134
The one in the yellow shirt!

530
00:39:07,664 --> 00:39:08,777
Oh, that's me.

531
00:39:08,777 --> 00:39:10,652
What's up, You, Thee?

532
00:39:15,129 --> 00:39:16,782
Green shirt, too!

533
00:39:18,008 --> 00:39:19,948
You, Thee!

534
00:39:20,769 --> 00:39:22,529
The pink shirt, that one's the troublemaker.

535
00:39:23,171 --> 00:39:25,681
I got hit in the head so hard,
and I'm still feeling the headache.

536
00:39:25,681 --> 00:39:28,734
Thee! You're useless!

537
00:39:33,983 --> 00:39:35,203
But that's okay.

538
00:39:35,203 --> 00:39:37,278
If you guys and Prim were having fun, I'm okay.

539
00:39:38,544 --> 00:39:40,039
But it should be an occasional thing.

540
00:39:40,546 --> 00:39:43,196
And if you're going to
get this drunk next time,

541
00:39:45,284 --> 00:39:46,284
invite me along.

542
00:39:47,546 --> 00:39:49,372
Sure thing, Thee!

543
00:40:05,756 --> 00:40:08,998
I'm downstairs buying a pen
and some headache medicine.

544
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:10,751
Yes, I'll be back soon.

545
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:16,007
Are you still hungover?

546
00:40:17,286 --> 00:40:18,806
How did you know I'm hungover?

547
00:40:21,837 --> 00:40:23,271
Do I smell like alcohol?

548
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,314
You don't remember anything, do you?

549
00:40:32,052 --> 00:40:33,307
Remember what?

550
00:40:34,382 --> 00:40:35,430
What happened?

551
00:40:43,712 --> 00:40:45,300
Mr.Kawee.

552
00:40:58,572 --> 00:40:59,572
Hey.

553
00:41:00,539 --> 00:41:01,924
What are you doing sitting here?

554
00:41:03,980 --> 00:41:06,507
I'm talking to Mr.Kawee.

555
00:41:08,006 --> 00:41:09,244
But I'm right here.

556
00:41:11,897 --> 00:41:15,949
Oh, why is Mr.Kawee sitting over there?

557
00:41:19,043 --> 00:41:21,772
Hello, Mr.Kawee, the handsome one.

558
00:41:22,524 --> 00:41:24,340
You're just right here.

559
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:27,919
The office's hottest guy.

560
00:41:36,191 --> 00:41:37,247
You're drunk.

561
00:41:39,473 --> 00:41:41,723
Mr.Kawee, you're such a workaholic.

562
00:41:41,723 --> 00:41:44,152
Don't you think about having a girlfriend?

563
00:41:46,084 --> 00:41:47,084
No.

564
00:41:48,578 --> 00:41:51,899
And… do you like anyone?

565
00:41:53,606 --> 00:41:54,606
I told you, no.

566
00:41:56,410 --> 00:41:58,796
You're drunk, you're not making sense.

567
00:41:58,796 --> 00:42:00,265
Alright, let me take you upstairs.

568
00:42:01,892 --> 00:42:03,400
I'm not drunk.

569
00:42:07,522 --> 00:42:09,588
Hey, hey, wait!

570
00:42:09,588 --> 00:42:10,742
Are you okay?

571
00:42:27,264 --> 00:42:29,867
You're so small but so heavy!

572
00:42:41,992 --> 00:42:43,896
Thanks for bringing me here.

573
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:49,857
I really like you.

574
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:32,562
I wonder if you'll remember
any of this tomorrow.

575
00:43:46,173 --> 00:43:47,526
Don't get so drunk that you puke,

576
00:43:48,498 --> 00:43:50,921
and don't confess your love
to random people like that again.

577
00:43:53,085 --> 00:43:56,047
I didn't randomly confess.

578
00:43:58,159 --> 00:43:59,703
Yeah, well.

579
00:44:01,146 --> 00:44:04,503
If you run into a bad guy,
you wouldn't make it back home in one piece.

580
00:44:07,451 --> 00:44:09,264
- You can be bad sometimes.
- Huh?

581
00:44:10,385 --> 00:44:11,385
Huh?

582
00:44:12,143 --> 00:44:13,243
It's nothing.

583
00:44:14,281 --> 00:44:16,771
I just wanted to apologize again.

584
00:44:19,470 --> 00:44:21,010
Promise me you won't get drunk again.

585
00:44:24,606 --> 00:44:25,606
Okay.

586
00:44:27,505 --> 00:44:28,505
Hey!

587
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:30,167
Well…

588
00:44:32,478 --> 00:44:34,468
Would you like to go to
the Loy Krathong festival tomorrow together?

589
00:44:36,717 --> 00:44:37,717
Well…

590
00:44:38,868 --> 00:44:42,141
My friend canceled,
and the event is free to join.

591
00:44:42,141 --> 00:44:44,289
There will be free food and giveaways too.

592
00:44:45,025 --> 00:44:46,025
Sounds interesting.

593
00:44:47,324 --> 00:44:48,424
So, that means you'll go?

594
00:44:49,985 --> 00:44:50,985
Yes.

595
00:45:03,246 --> 00:45:06,360
I'm so glad to see everyone.

596
00:45:07,760 --> 00:45:09,664
It feels so warm,

597
00:45:09,664 --> 00:45:12,803
like a family full of love.

598
00:45:13,856 --> 00:45:16,859
How about we have dinner here every Friday?

599
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:17,922
Well…

600
00:45:17,922 --> 00:45:21,053
Sounds good, Father. Isn't it great, everyone?

601
00:45:21,053 --> 00:45:23,077
That way, we can meet father more often, right?

602
00:45:23,077 --> 00:45:25,453
We can catch up on things in real time too.

603
00:45:27,112 --> 00:45:29,980
But I think this will be my last dinner here.

604
00:45:31,925 --> 00:45:33,208
What do you mean?

605
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,399
Thee!

606
00:45:38,339 --> 00:45:40,555
I'd like to leave the family, Grandpa.

607
00:45:44,778 --> 00:45:46,304
What does that mean?

608
00:45:47,293 --> 00:45:49,652
I'm just doing what you told me to do.

609
00:45:49,652 --> 00:45:52,138
You once told my father that
if I wanted to be with Prim,

610
00:45:52,718 --> 00:45:54,364
I had to leave the company

611
00:45:55,452 --> 00:45:57,239
and leave the family.

612
00:45:57,819 --> 00:46:02,080
So, you're saying
you're going back to be with her?

613
00:46:02,853 --> 00:46:04,468
You prefer a woman over family?

614
00:46:04,468 --> 00:46:06,376
I've never said
anyone is better than anyone else.

615
00:46:06,376 --> 00:46:09,582
It's just that what I want doesn't align with
what the company needs.

616
00:46:16,022 --> 00:46:17,922
I just want to be with the woman I love.

617
00:46:18,597 --> 00:46:20,385
And I want to follow my heart.

618
00:46:20,945 --> 00:46:23,982
So, you're just going to leave your job
and everyone so easily?

619
00:46:24,675 --> 00:46:26,815
I've cleared everything at the company,

620
00:46:26,815 --> 00:46:28,749
and the work has all been planned out.

621
00:46:28,749 --> 00:46:32,317
You can appoint anyone
to take over the position as you wish.

622
00:46:32,317 --> 00:46:34,799
I guarantee that the plans I've made…

623
00:46:34,799 --> 00:46:37,533
It will keep the company profitable
for decades to come.

624
00:46:38,300 --> 00:46:42,190
Even if the person taking over
is the worst manager ever.

625
00:46:50,057 --> 00:46:52,676
I'm full now. I'll be on my way.

626
00:46:54,257 --> 00:46:55,257
Goodbye.

627
00:46:56,985 --> 00:46:57,985
Thee!

628
00:47:42,754 --> 00:47:45,093
What are you doing here so early, sir?

629
00:47:45,093 --> 00:47:47,102
I came to see my future wife.

630
00:47:49,050 --> 00:47:53,113
Well, why are you riding a motorcycle
with three people on it, though?

631
00:47:55,104 --> 00:47:57,128
This morning, I was going to take
the motorcycle to your house,

632
00:47:57,128 --> 00:48:00,396
and I happened to meet the monk along the way.

633
00:48:00,396 --> 00:48:02,097
The monk said he was coming
to collect alms at your house,

634
00:48:02,097 --> 00:48:03,759
so I gave him a ride.

635
00:48:05,088 --> 00:48:06,188
I'm generous, huh?

636
00:48:06,836 --> 00:48:09,084
Who is more generous than a monk? That's me.

637
00:48:10,979 --> 00:48:11,979
Sure.

638
00:48:12,564 --> 00:48:16,618
Oh, but why didn't you drive here?
Why are you taking the motorcycle?

639
00:48:19,352 --> 00:48:21,234
I've left my family.

640
00:48:23,446 --> 00:48:26,570
Right now, I'm no longer involved
with my family or that company.

641
00:48:26,570 --> 00:48:28,356
You don't have to worry anymore.

642
00:48:30,360 --> 00:48:31,953
You really did that, sir?

643
00:48:32,633 --> 00:48:33,633
Yeah.

644
00:48:34,470 --> 00:48:37,344
Now, I'm completely free with nothing left.

645
00:48:37,911 --> 00:48:40,538
And I have nothing to do with
my prestigious family.

646
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:46,582
Can you feel how ordinary I am now?

647
00:48:49,878 --> 00:48:52,838
Yes, you're still shining brightly as ever.

648
00:48:53,525 --> 00:48:54,707
That's it.

649
00:48:54,707 --> 00:48:56,965
I'm very worried about that.

650
00:48:56,965 --> 00:48:58,925
I've always been born to be bright.

651
00:48:58,925 --> 00:49:00,276
It just won't dim.

652
00:49:03,711 --> 00:49:05,394
So what's your next step, sir?

653
00:49:07,639 --> 00:49:09,200
I'm planning to marry you, of course.

654
00:49:09,900 --> 00:49:10,900
Huh?

655
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:13,850
Are you going to give alms?

656
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:17,687
Of course.

657
00:49:20,596 --> 00:49:23,353
- This is the Chao Phraya River.
- All Right.

658
00:49:23,353 --> 00:49:25,121
So, a lot of boat traffic.

659
00:49:27,256 --> 00:49:29,659
And the Grand Palace is over there.

660
00:49:29,659 --> 00:49:31,552
Okay, we're going to go there tomorrow.

661
00:49:31,552 --> 00:49:33,358
Yes, that's the plan.

662
00:49:33,358 --> 00:49:34,833
Yeah.

663
00:49:34,833 --> 00:49:37,580
- I'm so excited.
- Me too. It'll be great.

664
00:49:37,580 --> 00:49:39,673
- People say it's beautiful.
- I heard.

665
00:49:39,673 --> 00:49:42,137
Before we go to Loy Krathong,

666
00:49:42,137 --> 00:49:44,909
we will go to Santacruz Church.

667
00:49:44,909 --> 00:49:47,569
That sounds great,
but I have a question for you.

668
00:49:47,569 --> 00:49:48,588
Who's this?

669
00:49:50,579 --> 00:49:52,697
I'm her bodyguard and…

670
00:49:53,899 --> 00:49:54,938
Her boyfriend.

671
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:57,306
I'm working right now!

672
00:49:57,306 --> 00:49:59,001
Oh, you go ahead and work.

673
00:49:59,001 --> 00:50:00,431
I'm just following you,

674
00:50:00,431 --> 00:50:02,622
So if there's anything, I can help you.

675
00:50:04,987 --> 00:50:06,746
Wow, I can go by myself.

676
00:50:06,746 --> 00:50:09,782
You can go with him. Happy honeymoon.

677
00:50:10,863 --> 00:50:11,871
Adorable.

678
00:50:11,871 --> 00:50:13,383
Bye! Have Fun!

679
00:50:18,832 --> 00:50:22,048
Since you're free now,
let's go on a trip together.

680
00:50:22,048 --> 00:50:23,048
Let's go!

681
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:34,119
Bhum…

682
00:50:34,119 --> 00:50:36,638
After floating a Krathong,
where would you like to go next?

683
00:50:37,878 --> 00:50:39,426
Hmm, I haven't thought of it yet.

684
00:50:40,254 --> 00:50:41,432
- Oh!
- Yeah?

685
00:50:41,432 --> 00:50:42,958
I'd like to go see fireworks.

686
00:50:43,558 --> 00:50:44,631
Fireworks?

687
00:50:44,631 --> 00:50:47,031
Oh, then would you like to
watch the fireworks from my place?

688
00:50:47,664 --> 00:50:48,671
Huh?

689
00:50:48,671 --> 00:50:49,807
Wait, I…

690
00:50:49,807 --> 00:50:51,220
I… I didn't mean it like that!

691
00:50:51,220 --> 00:50:55,441
I mean, at my place, there's a nice view.

692
00:50:55,441 --> 00:50:57,651
The fireworks are beautiful every year, Bhum.

693
00:50:57,651 --> 00:50:59,626
- Oh…
- Yeah.

694
00:50:59,626 --> 00:51:02,730
If we go, promise me,

695
00:51:02,730 --> 00:51:08,362
we'll see big fireworks,
like "Whoosh, boom, boom, boom!"

696
00:51:08,362 --> 00:51:13,241
No tiny ones that fizzle
like 'phew, phew, phew.'

697
00:51:13,241 --> 00:51:15,933
Those are disappointing, okay?

698
00:51:15,933 --> 00:51:18,712
Okay, I'll do my best to make it happen.

699
00:51:19,639 --> 00:51:24,611
No, I mean I will choose
the best view corner in the room for you, Bhum.

700
00:51:24,611 --> 00:51:26,239
- Oh, okay.
- Alright.

701
00:51:26,779 --> 00:51:28,572
Yes, but Bhum…

702
00:51:29,771 --> 00:51:31,104
Are you ready to go?

703
00:51:31,644 --> 00:51:32,746
Yes, let's go.

704
00:51:49,018 --> 00:51:53,038
May all the suffering, sorrow, and sadness

705
00:51:53,988 --> 00:51:56,470
drift away with this Krathong.

706
00:51:56,470 --> 00:52:03,460
And if any powers can grant

707
00:52:03,460 --> 00:52:05,378
a new soulmate for me, Pat.

708
00:52:05,378 --> 00:52:08,575
Please grant me the wish for me.

709
00:52:08,575 --> 00:52:10,062
Amen.

710
00:52:13,012 --> 00:52:14,045
Oh!

711
00:52:14,045 --> 00:52:15,567
How long have you been here?

712
00:52:15,567 --> 00:52:16,966
Oh, be careful!

713
00:52:16,966 --> 00:52:18,766
Oh, that was close.

714
00:52:18,766 --> 00:52:19,837
Are you hurt?

715
00:52:19,837 --> 00:52:21,664
Ploen, oh my god.

716
00:52:21,664 --> 00:52:23,560
Why didn't you wait for me, sweetie?

717
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:24,560
Ploen!

718
00:52:25,634 --> 00:52:27,681
- She's okay, ma'am.
- I almost couldn't catch up, love.

719
00:52:27,681 --> 00:52:29,223
- Are you okay?
- She's okay.

720
00:52:31,093 --> 00:52:33,593
I wanted to come see the Krathong, Mom.

721
00:52:34,339 --> 00:52:38,778
And also, there's a handsome uncle
who helped Ploen out too,

722
00:52:38,778 --> 00:52:40,550
so you don't need to worry, Mom.

723
00:52:42,567 --> 00:52:46,531
What did you just call me? Handsome uncle?

724
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,252
Oh, if you say such nice things,

725
00:52:48,252 --> 00:52:50,954
should I give you some money for snacks,
maybe a hundred?

726
00:52:50,954 --> 00:52:52,589
Can I have two hundred?

727
00:52:53,699 --> 00:52:55,400
Ploen, sweetie!

728
00:52:56,500 --> 00:53:00,413
Anyway, I truly want to thank you,
and I also apologize for my daughter.

729
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:04,110
She's a funny kid and still as cute as her mom.

730
00:53:05,998 --> 00:53:06,998
Excuse me…

731
00:53:07,658 --> 00:53:10,108
Are you working as a flight attendant?

732
00:53:10,108 --> 00:53:12,250
Oh, yeah.

733
00:53:12,250 --> 00:53:17,095
I'm a flight attendant,
and I'm also a single mom.

734
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,850
You… you just said…

735
00:53:19,850 --> 00:53:21,417
Miss Prah? Prae?

736
00:53:21,417 --> 00:53:22,906
It's Pear.

737
00:53:22,906 --> 00:53:25,048
- Par?
- Pear.

738
00:53:25,048 --> 00:53:27,581
Oh, Miss Pear. Right?

739
00:53:27,581 --> 00:53:28,907
It's Pear.

740
00:53:28,907 --> 00:53:30,680
Mine is… Pat.

741
00:53:32,779 --> 00:53:33,796
Pat!

742
00:53:33,796 --> 00:53:35,387
My name is Pat.

743
00:53:36,206 --> 00:53:37,206
Pat.

744
00:53:42,162 --> 00:53:43,423
Are you tired today?

745
00:53:44,596 --> 00:53:45,696
A little.

746
00:53:46,746 --> 00:53:49,267
I just realized that
doing tours is exhausting, too.

747
00:53:50,094 --> 00:53:53,289
But my girlfriend is perfect.

748
00:53:53,829 --> 00:53:56,259
It would be more perfect if no one followed me.

749
00:53:58,789 --> 00:54:00,109
Just kidding.

750
00:54:00,802 --> 00:54:03,490
Then I'll reward you for being perfect.

751
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,125
I'll go buy you a drink.

752
00:54:05,125 --> 00:54:06,258
I can go with you too.

753
00:54:06,258 --> 00:54:08,405
No need. Wait here.

754
00:54:08,405 --> 00:54:09,405
Okay.

755
00:54:29,512 --> 00:54:30,512
Hey.

756
00:54:33,372 --> 00:54:34,972
Why dress like this?

757
00:54:35,619 --> 00:54:37,814
Well, I'm getting ready to collect coins.

758
00:54:39,797 --> 00:54:42,332
Oh, then aren't you going
to float the Krathong with me?

759
00:54:43,469 --> 00:54:46,840
No, I've floated it before,
but didn't get anything.

760
00:54:48,089 --> 00:54:50,136
It's like throwing money
into the river for nothing.

761
00:54:51,407 --> 00:54:52,829
It also pollutes the water,

762
00:54:53,475 --> 00:54:55,479
and it's a burden for others
to clean up the trash.

763
00:54:58,386 --> 00:55:00,298
Now you've made me
not want to float it anymore.

764
00:55:04,769 --> 00:55:08,282
To be honest,
the reason you invited me to go out…

765
00:55:09,274 --> 00:55:10,570
is that you like me, right?

766
00:55:12,862 --> 00:55:13,862
Huh?

767
00:55:18,138 --> 00:55:19,470
Actually, I like you too.

768
00:55:24,745 --> 00:55:25,988
The truth is…

769
00:55:28,556 --> 00:55:31,165
I feel good to you…

770
00:55:35,909 --> 00:55:39,542
because you're kind and cute.

771
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:47,926
But…

772
00:55:49,625 --> 00:55:50,978
But… I think I have to decline.

773
00:55:55,045 --> 00:55:56,045
Huh?

774
00:55:58,105 --> 00:55:59,105
Why?

775
00:56:01,844 --> 00:56:03,968
Because I want to focus on
making my work successful.

776
00:56:06,658 --> 00:56:08,160
I want to save money to buy a house.

777
00:56:10,878 --> 00:56:13,016
I want to buy several leather jackets.

778
00:56:17,285 --> 00:56:19,732
I don't want to lose focus on other things…

779
00:56:21,134 --> 00:56:22,876
Until I achieve my goals.

780
00:56:26,574 --> 00:56:27,787
But…

781
00:56:27,787 --> 00:56:32,832
you can follow your goals
and still date me, you know.

782
00:56:36,478 --> 00:56:37,798
But if you date me,

783
00:56:39,947 --> 00:56:41,639
you won't get to date like other people.

784
00:56:46,611 --> 00:56:48,808
You'll only get sweet and sour pork
on your birthday,

785
00:56:50,225 --> 00:56:52,056
and eat stir-fried basil every day.

786
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,907
I don't want you to be struggling with me.

787
00:57:01,759 --> 00:57:04,937
But I'm okay with it. I think I can handle it.

788
00:57:12,253 --> 00:57:13,905
Please don't force yourself for me.

789
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:18,370
Go live the life you want to live.

790
00:57:23,245 --> 00:57:24,757
Someone as stingy as me…

791
00:57:26,735 --> 00:57:27,920
can't date anyone.

792
00:57:35,436 --> 00:57:36,436
I'm sorry.

793
00:57:38,188 --> 00:57:39,875
I'll go dive and collect coins now.

794
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,020
Hey!

795
00:58:15,817 --> 00:58:17,945
Oh, so cute!

796
00:58:31,791 --> 00:58:33,073
You want my hand?

797
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,180
The other one?

798
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:52,167
Oh, what is this?

799
00:58:57,476 --> 00:59:00,387
I knew it, what are you doing, sir?

800
00:59:00,387 --> 00:59:02,797
Well, you said you wanted to adopt a cat,

801
00:59:02,797 --> 00:59:04,253
so I transformed into an orange cat.

802
00:59:04,253 --> 00:59:06,245
And you'll take me home with you.

803
00:59:18,187 --> 00:59:19,919
Marry me, Prim.

804
00:59:23,340 --> 00:59:26,499
I promise I'll make you happy every day.

805
00:59:27,949 --> 00:59:30,762
I'll sing you lullabies before bed every night,

806
00:59:31,593 --> 00:59:33,715
and I'll be a good husband,

807
00:59:33,715 --> 00:59:35,421
staying with you for the rest of my life.

808
00:59:48,624 --> 00:59:49,624
No.

809
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:52,588
Huh?

810
00:59:53,660 --> 00:59:54,660
Why?

811
00:59:56,328 --> 00:59:59,227
You have proposed to me several times already.

812
00:59:59,227 --> 01:00:01,704
This time, I'm going to propose to you.

813
01:00:01,704 --> 01:00:04,039
Just like when I asked you to marry me
when I was younger.

814
01:00:13,386 --> 01:00:14,647
Will you marry me?

815
01:00:21,777 --> 01:00:24,246
So, you're really going to
take this cat home, right?

816
01:00:25,952 --> 01:00:26,952
Sure.

817
01:00:27,576 --> 01:00:31,884
♫ The moment of falling in love
Feels just like this ♫

818
01:00:31,884 --> 01:00:35,610
♫ That split second when I saw you ♫

819
01:00:35,610 --> 01:00:37,555
I love you, Prim.

820
01:00:37,555 --> 01:00:39,660
I love you too.

821
01:00:39,660 --> 01:00:42,876
♫ It felt like the world slowed down ♫

822
01:00:42,876 --> 01:00:46,988
♫ The moment of falling in love
Feels just like this ♫

823
01:00:46,988 --> 01:00:51,107
♫ That fleeting instant when we met ♫

824
01:00:51,107 --> 01:00:54,864
♫ The moment we connected,
the moment our eyes met ♫

825
01:00:54,864 --> 01:00:58,176
♫ I wish I could freeze this time forever ♫

826
01:00:58,176 --> 01:01:02,410
♫ In this moment, I love you ♫

827
01:01:05,887 --> 01:01:08,193
Hey, is the boss really going to resign?

828
01:01:08,193 --> 01:01:10,617
Go get Thee back to work, no matter what.

829
01:01:10,617 --> 01:01:14,318
If you can't,
I'll cut ties with both you and your son.

830
01:01:14,318 --> 01:01:16,866
What do you want me to do?
I'm stuck in the middle here.

831
01:01:16,866 --> 01:01:19,541
In this matter, you have to pick a side.

832
01:01:19,541 --> 01:01:22,741
I know you want to achieve your goals first,

833
01:01:22,741 --> 01:01:24,712
but I also want you to love yourself.

834
01:01:24,712 --> 01:01:26,352
I'll try to do that.

835
01:01:26,352 --> 01:01:29,290
So, who did they appoint
as the new Vice President after me?

836
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:32,846
That's actually why I'm here today.
