1
00:01:05,206 --> 00:01:08,271
If you're going to get married,
you must marry only me.

2
00:01:08,271 --> 00:01:12,873
I have never seen anyone ask a girl to
marry them while she's icing her feet.

3
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:15,438
This is it. After this,
Prim will definitely like me.

4
00:01:15,438 --> 00:01:16,965
You're not my type.

5
00:01:16,965 --> 00:01:18,973
No!

6
00:01:18,973 --> 00:01:21,565
I'll show you that I'm the right one.

7
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:23,105
If that day hadn't happened,

8
00:01:23,105 --> 00:01:25,265
the place you're standing in now would be mine!

9
00:01:26,473 --> 00:01:29,757
I like the Valentine's event format
your friend created

10
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:33,881
Regarding the author, I emailed
the publishing house and await their reply.

11
00:01:33,881 --> 00:01:36,417
Secretary to Vice President

12
00:01:36,417 --> 00:01:37,421
Primala.

13
00:01:39,412 --> 00:01:41,458
On Valentine's Day,
let's go have dinner together.

14
00:01:46,156 --> 00:01:47,739
<i>Don't kid around like this, Boss!</i>

15
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,216
<i>I'm not kidding.</i>

16
00:01:50,216 --> 00:01:53,190
<i>I'm always serious, especially you.</i>

17
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:56,565
<i>You're not allowed to go anywhere
with anyone else, especially Dr. Tawan.</i>

18
00:01:56,565 --> 00:01:58,082
<i>If you keep seeing him,</i>

19
00:01:58,889 --> 00:01:59,889
<i>I will…</i>

20
00:01:59,889 --> 00:02:00,889
<i>Will what?</i>

21
00:02:11,429 --> 00:02:14,319
You can't keep dreaming about falling off
buildings like this, Prim!

22
00:02:30,165 --> 00:02:32,274
<i>Miss Prim, I have brought
your little goldfish back.</i>

23
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:39,389
Meow Meow!

24
00:02:40,296 --> 00:02:41,765
Is Meow Meow all better now?

25
00:02:42,342 --> 00:02:43,342
No.

26
00:02:44,222 --> 00:02:46,038
Meow Meow is dead. This is a new one.

27
00:02:46,038 --> 00:02:47,038
What?

28
00:02:51,013 --> 00:02:52,177
No, Meow Meow!

29
00:02:53,866 --> 00:02:55,500
I'm kidding, Prim.

30
00:02:57,219 --> 00:03:00,879
Dr. Tawan, that was too much!
I'm about to cry now!

31
00:03:01,653 --> 00:03:04,980
Sorry, I just can't help teasing you
when I see you.

32
00:03:07,273 --> 00:03:09,848
Thank you so much, Dr. Tawan.

33
00:03:10,772 --> 00:03:12,851
But you didn't have to bring it over yourself.

34
00:03:12,851 --> 00:03:14,739
You could have called me to pick it up.

35
00:03:14,739 --> 00:03:17,419
It's no trouble at all. I wanted to see you.

36
00:03:18,256 --> 00:03:20,803
Are you heading to work now?
Let me drop you off.

37
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:24,339
Well…

38
00:03:24,339 --> 00:03:25,405
There's no need for that.

39
00:03:28,376 --> 00:03:29,895
Prim will come with me anyway.

40
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:32,409
But I asked her first.

41
00:03:32,409 --> 00:03:35,236
What matters is who she will actually go with.

42
00:03:39,151 --> 00:03:40,311
Exactly, She will go with me.

43
00:03:41,850 --> 00:03:44,170
We will head in the same way,
so don't trouble you, Doctor.

44
00:03:45,253 --> 00:03:47,719
I enjoy trouble. It's more exciting that way.

45
00:03:48,792 --> 00:03:50,518
So, who will you go with, Prim?

46
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,144
I'll go by myself.

47
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:09,750
Thank you for everything
with Meow Meow, Dr. Tawan.

48
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,924
See you at the office, Boss.

49
00:04:54,391 --> 00:04:55,397
You like it, don't you?

50
00:04:59,753 --> 00:05:00,859
It's cute.

51
00:05:07,506 --> 00:05:10,198
They even decorated inside the elevator.

52
00:05:10,198 --> 00:05:11,300
So adorable.

53
00:05:17,701 --> 00:05:20,395
What? Decorating the office more?

54
00:05:21,317 --> 00:05:23,687
Yes, you told the facilities team

55
00:05:23,687 --> 00:05:26,478
to go all out with the Valentine's
theme this year.

56
00:05:27,232 --> 00:05:31,056
Anything cute, anything sweet, do it all.

57
00:05:43,952 --> 00:05:44,956
What's up?

58
00:05:45,998 --> 00:05:49,757
I want to check if you hit your head
so hard that you lost your mind!

59
00:05:50,358 --> 00:05:52,318
As far as I can see, everything is normal.

60
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,313
Hey, Mr. Vice President.

61
00:05:56,313 --> 00:06:01,368
Usually every Valentine's Day, do you even
realize that you keep being sarcastic about it?

62
00:06:01,368 --> 00:06:04,119
"What's this? So cheesy."

63
00:06:04,119 --> 00:06:07,866
"So sweet, it's too much!"
"Pink? It's so over-the-top."

64
00:06:07,866 --> 00:06:10,588
But this year,
you're the one asking to go all out.

65
00:06:10,588 --> 00:06:11,588
Strange.

66
00:06:14,458 --> 00:06:15,464
Don't tell me…

67
00:06:21,913 --> 00:06:27,175
Yep. This year, I'm using Valentine's Day
to create the perfect atmosphere for Prim.

68
00:06:35,760 --> 00:06:38,584
So she'll stop lying to herself

69
00:06:39,432 --> 00:06:44,003
and finally admit her feelings for me
just like I have thought before.

70
00:06:45,830 --> 00:06:48,699
so she'll stop planning to quit
and run away from me.

71
00:06:49,335 --> 00:06:52,926
Because no matter what,
I won't let her go anywhere else.

72
00:06:57,247 --> 00:07:00,213
I just came to drop these documents off
for the director to sign.

73
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,229
But I can come back later.

74
00:07:08,693 --> 00:07:12,278
I don't know what's going on
between you and Prim,

75
00:07:13,637 --> 00:07:15,179
but what's about me and you,

76
00:07:16,136 --> 00:07:17,776
my assistant's already overthinking it.

77
00:07:20,071 --> 00:07:21,645
This made me really uncomfortable.

78
00:07:25,412 --> 00:07:26,814
So, what did you tell them?

79
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:29,409
What is it?

80
00:07:31,315 --> 00:07:33,275
The invitation for Valentine's dinner.

81
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,103
What did you tell him?

82
00:07:38,186 --> 00:07:39,186
I haven't answered yet.

83
00:07:39,901 --> 00:07:43,533
I don't know if I can go have dinner with him.

84
00:07:43,533 --> 00:07:46,395
Well, our mall has an event tomorrow.

85
00:07:48,726 --> 00:07:49,751
I see.

86
00:07:51,297 --> 00:07:52,297
Got it.

87
00:08:02,157 --> 00:08:03,425
Why are you standing behind me?

88
00:08:05,143 --> 00:08:08,006
Well, I usually stand behind you, Boss.

89
00:08:18,576 --> 00:08:20,509
Then, from now on, I'll stand beside you.

90
00:08:40,653 --> 00:08:44,733
Prim! Someone secretly
took a picture of Mr. Morpheus.

91
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:46,180
Want to see what he looks like?

92
00:08:46,180 --> 00:08:47,295
Really? Let me see!

93
00:08:47,937 --> 00:08:49,315
Handsome, right?

94
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:55,232
How can you even tell? The picture's so blurry!

95
00:08:55,232 --> 00:08:56,905
Oh, come on, Prim.

96
00:08:56,905 --> 00:09:01,107
When we admire someone, we find them handsome
in every single detail.

97
00:09:02,309 --> 00:09:03,582
Haven't you ever felt that way?

98
00:09:05,373 --> 00:09:06,373
I haven't…

99
00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:36,899
too much to resist.

100
00:09:37,561 --> 00:09:39,436
What? What's too much to resist?

101
00:09:40,937 --> 00:09:42,227
Oh! Nothing.

102
00:09:43,982 --> 00:09:47,788
Well, now that you mention it, Mr. Morpheus
really is as handsome as you said, huh?

103
00:09:47,788 --> 00:09:48,788
Right?

104
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:54,995
But he looks so familiar
as if I have seen him somewhere before.

105
00:09:57,036 --> 00:09:59,206
If you have really met him before,

106
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:01,799
and you see him again, don't forget
to get his autograph for me.

107
00:10:01,799 --> 00:10:02,799
Sure.

108
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:11,280
Thank you very much. See you in Guangzhou.

109
00:10:18,865 --> 00:10:21,544
This is the double-checked
budget approval document, Boss.

110
00:10:26,521 --> 00:10:27,524
What happened?

111
00:10:28,196 --> 00:10:30,380
Just a paper cut, no big deal.

112
00:10:30,380 --> 00:10:33,304
It's not okay at all! Let me treat it for you.

113
00:10:48,459 --> 00:10:49,461
All done.

114
00:10:50,852 --> 00:10:52,536
Isn't this much?

115
00:10:55,700 --> 00:10:59,959
Anyone who sees this
might think I have lost a finger!

116
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:02,859
Well, it's my first time
doing this for someone.

117
00:11:05,237 --> 00:11:07,166
Alright, then. I'll redo it for you.

118
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:08,572
No need.

119
00:11:11,293 --> 00:11:13,551
I'll keep it as it is for the memory.

120
00:11:20,243 --> 00:11:21,403
Excuse me, Boss.

121
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:24,210
Hello.

122
00:11:25,646 --> 00:11:27,044
Yes, got it.

123
00:11:28,043 --> 00:11:29,201
Thank you very much.

124
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,621
The author's publisher I'm inviting to
the Valentine's event has agreed to attend!

125
00:11:36,621 --> 00:11:39,934
But the author asked me to meet
and discuss the details first.

126
00:11:39,934 --> 00:11:41,506
May I go meet them?

127
00:11:48,225 --> 00:11:49,230
Thank you so much.

128
00:11:54,442 --> 00:11:55,448
Perfect.

129
00:12:22,823 --> 00:12:25,011
How did these roses get here?

130
00:12:27,704 --> 00:12:28,784
Surprise!

131
00:12:31,847 --> 00:12:35,772
Do you like them?
A little early Valentine's gift from me.

132
00:12:42,703 --> 00:12:45,664
I know you have been worried about the kids.

133
00:12:47,881 --> 00:12:51,814
I saw the kids fighting like this,
and it broke my heart.

134
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,372
It's okay.

135
00:12:54,421 --> 00:12:57,121
We have made it
through tough times up until now.

136
00:12:57,716 --> 00:12:59,963
Eventually, the kids will figure things out.

137
00:13:01,415 --> 00:13:03,218
Everything will get better on its own.

138
00:13:04,764 --> 00:13:08,051
But what if it gets worse?

139
00:13:12,726 --> 00:13:13,905
The weather is nice today.

140
00:13:14,979 --> 00:13:16,818
Let's go have lunch outside.

141
00:13:17,625 --> 00:13:20,444
Afterward, you can go shopping

142
00:13:20,444 --> 00:13:24,171
for that new bag you keep eyeing.

143
00:13:26,166 --> 00:13:27,500
No need.

144
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:28,513
What?

145
00:13:28,513 --> 00:13:30,100
I already bought it.

146
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,272
You did?

147
00:13:31,272 --> 00:13:34,540
Yes, I bought seven of them.

148
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:38,979
Don't tell me that seven bags, seven colors?

149
00:13:40,518 --> 00:13:43,899
No. I bought seven bags, all the same color.

150
00:13:43,899 --> 00:13:44,915
I love them.

151
00:13:46,941 --> 00:13:49,089
Seven bags, all the same color.

152
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:54,791
Women are really hard to understand.

153
00:14:14,140 --> 00:14:15,140
We meet again.

154
00:14:16,363 --> 00:14:17,689
Hello.

155
00:14:17,689 --> 00:14:20,609
Sorry, I'm late. Still not used to
the traffic in Bangkok.

156
00:14:21,546 --> 00:14:22,548
What?

157
00:14:23,699 --> 00:14:26,010
You invited me yourself,
but you forgot about it, right?

158
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:33,209
You're Primala, the secretary of the
vice president of Theeranont Group.

159
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:38,022
You emailed me to be a guest
at the Valentine's Day book reading event.

160
00:14:38,022 --> 00:14:39,023
Didn't you?

161
00:14:41,366 --> 00:14:42,369
You're…

162
00:14:44,290 --> 00:14:47,190
So you're Morpheus, aren't you?

163
00:14:48,331 --> 00:14:49,571
Yes, I am.

164
00:14:52,114 --> 00:14:53,834
By the way, what happened to your fingers?

165
00:14:57,077 --> 00:15:00,323
It's not a long story, but it's funny.

166
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:15,371
What greater joy is there than
finally being able to relieve yourself

167
00:15:15,371 --> 00:15:17,340
after a long three-hour meeting?

168
00:15:17,340 --> 00:15:19,062
What's with all the serious meetings?

169
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:34,136
Why did you just appear out of nowhere?

170
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:35,515
You acted like a ghost!

171
00:15:36,098 --> 00:15:37,867
Are you a ghost?

172
00:15:38,405 --> 00:15:41,308
Oh, wait, but that doesn't
make sense. You're still warm.

173
00:15:41,823 --> 00:15:42,903
Have you washed your hands?

174
00:15:43,714 --> 00:15:45,794
Don't worry, I used this hand.

175
00:15:46,582 --> 00:15:48,928
Have you done it yet? I need to talk with you.

176
00:15:48,928 --> 00:15:50,890
Are you in a rush? Can I grab some food first?

177
00:15:51,776 --> 00:15:55,195
Hey! I told you I used this hand.
You're holding the hand I used!

178
00:15:56,538 --> 00:16:00,951
Even though I am a fan of your books,
I have never seen your face,

179
00:16:00,951 --> 00:16:02,477
so I'm not acting very professional.

180
00:16:03,406 --> 00:16:06,116
Don't feel bad. I'm feeling great right now.

181
00:16:07,891 --> 00:16:09,701
Do you know why I arranged this meeting here?

182
00:16:12,132 --> 00:16:14,252
Because I really like the hot chocolate here.

183
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:18,108
One hot chocolate with
someone I have been drawn to.

184
00:16:18,619 --> 00:16:20,385
I feel even better.

185
00:16:20,891 --> 00:16:22,816
A memorable line from "Viktor in Your Sun".

186
00:16:24,792 --> 00:16:26,414
You're really a fan of mine.

187
00:16:28,140 --> 00:16:31,899
With a fan like you, I'm already
motivated to go back and write more books.

188
00:16:36,012 --> 00:16:40,447
What? Your competitor invited
Prim to dinner on Valentine's Day?

189
00:16:40,447 --> 00:16:41,460
Did she say yes?

190
00:16:44,119 --> 00:16:47,727
With that sour face, you mean
she agreed, right?

191
00:16:48,240 --> 00:16:51,300
I think you should find a new girlfriend

192
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:53,518
or maybe get back with Ginny. It'll be easier.

193
00:16:54,591 --> 00:16:56,235
Prim hasn't agreed yet!

194
00:16:56,799 --> 00:16:58,952
I'm actually stressed,
unsure what she's going to do.

195
00:16:58,952 --> 00:17:00,576
Whether she's going or not. That's all.

196
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:05,433
Think about it.
The odds of Prim going are 50/50, right?

197
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:09,083
But if you consider how short
Prim has known that guy,

198
00:17:09,083 --> 00:17:13,006
the odds of her not going
will increase to 60/40.

199
00:17:13,006 --> 00:17:16,431
Based on how I treated her fingers earlier

200
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:18,135
and the smile she gave me,

201
00:17:18,135 --> 00:17:22,607
the odds of her not going
will increase to 70/30.

202
00:17:22,607 --> 00:17:26,016
So Prim probably won't go. Great!

203
00:17:26,016 --> 00:17:27,021
What's great?!

204
00:17:28,446 --> 00:17:34,017
In business,
even the longest odds can turn around.

205
00:17:34,553 --> 00:17:38,260
I don't trust that 30% chance
until it becomes 0%. Got it?

206
00:17:39,075 --> 00:17:41,383
Got it. So, what are you going to do?

207
00:17:41,383 --> 00:17:43,929
That's the problem. What should I do?

208
00:17:45,646 --> 00:17:48,085
Thank you so much
for agreeing to join the event,

209
00:17:48,085 --> 00:17:49,811
even though it was so sudden like this.

210
00:17:50,338 --> 00:17:53,220
Here's the contract for the collaboration.

211
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,881
Please take a look at the details first.

212
00:17:54,881 --> 00:17:58,425
If everything looks good, I'll send
the filled official contract to you.

213
00:17:58,425 --> 00:18:01,020
I'm really sorry for how rushed it was.

214
00:18:02,525 --> 00:18:03,739
While I read through this,

215
00:18:03,739 --> 00:18:05,619
feel free to enjoy some snacks.

216
00:18:07,326 --> 00:18:08,327
Thank you.

217
00:18:29,932 --> 00:18:32,145
They won't taste as good
if you don't eat them today.

218
00:18:33,259 --> 00:18:34,893
Oh, okay.

219
00:18:57,813 --> 00:18:59,060
Shall we go to another place?

220
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,933
You're allergic to flower pollen, right?

221
00:19:06,566 --> 00:19:09,921
<i>He can tell I'm allergic to pollen
by looking for a moment.</i>

222
00:19:12,566 --> 00:19:13,573
It's fine.

223
00:19:14,339 --> 00:19:16,224
Just continue reading the contract.

224
00:19:16,224 --> 00:19:17,227
I'm okay.

225
00:19:26,293 --> 00:19:27,293
Sorry!

226
00:19:28,753 --> 00:19:30,073
Then let's go ahead.

227
00:19:35,645 --> 00:19:36,648
How about this?

228
00:19:37,172 --> 00:19:38,929
You just send someone to take care of him.

229
00:19:38,929 --> 00:19:41,538
Yong, he's an ex-soldier.

230
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:47,356
Let Yong kill him, cement him, and toss it
in the sea for the sharks. How about that?

231
00:19:48,144 --> 00:19:49,162
Not good, huh?

232
00:19:49,162 --> 00:19:50,671
I shouldn't have wasted time with you.

233
00:19:50,671 --> 00:19:51,803
Hey, Wait!

234
00:19:53,465 --> 00:19:55,258
I just thought of something!

235
00:19:55,258 --> 00:19:57,153
Better than having sharks or cement?

236
00:19:57,153 --> 00:19:58,699
Whale. Whale!

237
00:19:58,699 --> 00:20:00,285
I'm just kidding.

238
00:20:01,392 --> 00:20:03,467
I just thought of something.

239
00:20:03,467 --> 00:20:06,475
Just now, you were talking
about closing a business deal, right?

240
00:20:06,475 --> 00:20:07,899
Yeah. So?

241
00:20:07,899 --> 00:20:12,484
The principle is:
Whoever closes the deal first wins.

242
00:20:13,437 --> 00:20:14,441
Am I right?

243
00:20:21,854 --> 00:20:22,859
Yes, sir.

244
00:20:26,167 --> 00:20:29,135
I have met the author now. Got it.

245
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:31,977
Is the boss looking for you?

246
00:20:32,898 --> 00:20:33,899
Yes.

247
00:20:34,814 --> 00:20:37,739
In that case, you can send
the contract to the publishing house.

248
00:20:37,739 --> 00:20:39,099
I'll have them take care of it.

249
00:20:39,694 --> 00:20:42,507
Okay. Regarding the details for tomorrow,

250
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:45,261
I'll have my team send them
to the publishing house as well.

251
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:46,263
Got it.

252
00:20:47,016 --> 00:20:50,024
Now, I can get your phone number, right?

253
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,050
Sure.

254
00:21:07,992 --> 00:21:08,996
Hello.

255
00:21:09,966 --> 00:21:11,809
Now we have finally talked on the phone.

256
00:21:12,427 --> 00:21:13,430
Thank you.

257
00:21:14,388 --> 00:21:17,092
Oh, and save my number, okay?
Please don't delete it.

258
00:21:18,025 --> 00:21:19,031
Got it.

259
00:21:28,838 --> 00:21:30,672
Hey, let me help with that.

260
00:21:30,672 --> 00:21:32,020
Oh, it's fine, Prim.

261
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:34,246
It's okay, give it to me.

262
00:21:36,079 --> 00:21:37,592
Prim, what's making you so cheerful?

263
00:21:39,026 --> 00:21:40,225
Is it that obvious?

264
00:21:40,913 --> 00:21:42,488
Did something good happen?

265
00:21:43,383 --> 00:21:45,703
Once it's confirmed, I'll tell you.

266
00:21:45,703 --> 00:21:47,682
But I'll tell you, you'll scream for sure.

267
00:21:48,209 --> 00:21:52,410
Oh, Prim, you're saying this,
and now I really want to know!

268
00:21:52,410 --> 00:21:53,874
Please tell me.

269
00:21:54,392 --> 00:21:55,393
No. I'm not telling.

270
00:21:59,218 --> 00:22:02,331
Secretary Prim, please come in here.

271
00:22:03,392 --> 00:22:04,395
Yes.

272
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,202
This lift is decorated nicely too.

273
00:22:18,820 --> 00:22:22,661
Looks like the building department's
definitely in love this year, right?

274
00:22:22,661 --> 00:22:26,859
Actually, I kind of want to be in love too.

275
00:22:26,859 --> 00:22:31,930
So my face can glow, and my blood will pump

276
00:22:31,930 --> 00:22:34,402
like someone dating someone younger.

277
00:22:36,997 --> 00:22:40,933
Excuse me, my love is pure.

278
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:43,300
We're going in a direction
where we're not trying

279
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:46,859
to do anything that others think we're doing!

280
00:22:50,318 --> 00:22:54,420
Don't let me catch you two,
or I'll expose everything!

281
00:22:56,579 --> 00:22:59,494
Bring it on, whether you expose or not!

282
00:22:59,494 --> 00:23:01,746
I'm not afraid. Botox for the ankles!

283
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,766
You're so dramatic.

284
00:23:04,766 --> 00:23:05,768
It's the truth.

285
00:23:08,023 --> 00:23:10,189
Hey, Kawee!!

286
00:23:10,798 --> 00:23:12,488
You switched modes so quickly.

287
00:23:13,050 --> 00:23:14,050
Please go ahead.

288
00:23:14,050 --> 00:23:18,322
Oh, Kawee, come in! We won't bite, come on in.

289
00:23:24,607 --> 00:23:28,022
Kawee, are you free this Valentine's Day?

290
00:23:28,738 --> 00:23:33,422
If you're free, how about we go out together?

291
00:23:35,345 --> 00:23:37,347
Everyone in the building
asked me about that today.

292
00:23:37,901 --> 00:23:40,300
I'm sorry, but I already have a date with work.

293
00:23:41,054 --> 00:23:42,596
Oh. A date with work?

294
00:23:45,631 --> 00:23:47,973
He doesn't dislike me, he just loves his work.

295
00:23:47,973 --> 00:23:51,724
So handsome, so talented, so hardworking.

296
00:23:51,724 --> 00:23:56,358
You should rest, or you'll pass out!

297
00:23:57,425 --> 00:23:58,500
Thanks.

298
00:23:58,500 --> 00:24:00,939
Out? What does that mean?

299
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:02,019
He likes it!

300
00:24:06,883 --> 00:24:07,883
What's wrong with you?

301
00:24:08,939 --> 00:24:13,316
Well, suddenly, I smelled something sour,

302
00:24:13,316 --> 00:24:15,973
kind of like rotten socks.

303
00:24:15,973 --> 00:24:17,373
I don't know where it came from.

304
00:24:17,373 --> 00:24:19,659
Really? I'm not wearing socks, see?

305
00:24:19,659 --> 00:24:21,260
Where is it coming from?

306
00:24:26,439 --> 00:24:29,020
Hey! Kawee, wait!

307
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:32,255
Kawee, wait, wait!

308
00:24:32,255 --> 00:24:33,263
Wait!

309
00:24:37,896 --> 00:24:39,404
Are you free tonight, Secretary Prim?

310
00:24:40,534 --> 00:24:41,539
Well…

311
00:24:41,539 --> 00:24:43,505
You're free. I checked your schedule.

312
00:24:43,505 --> 00:24:45,237
You don't have any personal appointments.

313
00:24:46,727 --> 00:24:50,162
Yes, I'm free. Is there something urgent?

314
00:24:51,187 --> 00:24:54,201
No, I'm inviting you to dinner
for Valentine's Day.

315
00:24:55,359 --> 00:24:56,992
But Valentine's Day is tomorrow.

316
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,754
I don't like following the crowd.

317
00:24:59,754 --> 00:25:03,426
I have already booked a restaurant.
I'll send you the details. We'll meet there.

318
00:25:04,339 --> 00:25:05,345
Deal.

319
00:25:11,732 --> 00:25:13,025
Dress nicely.

320
00:25:21,419 --> 00:25:22,805
So thoughtful.

321
00:25:27,983 --> 00:25:32,699
Hey, newbie! About the sour smell,
you keep talking about every day.

322
00:25:33,359 --> 00:25:36,814
I think you should get your nose checked.
It seems like it's broken.

323
00:25:37,991 --> 00:25:39,828
But don't at the same place as Bhum's.

324
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:42,668
She's known for having silicone leaks.

325
00:25:42,668 --> 00:25:43,985
Here we go again.

326
00:25:47,086 --> 00:25:48,659
Everyone, look!

327
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:53,364
The other day, I saw a tomato
sauce stain on that guy's shirt,

328
00:25:53,364 --> 00:25:55,708
and it's still there today.

329
00:25:57,733 --> 00:26:02,095
I bet he only has one shirt,

330
00:26:02,095 --> 00:26:07,324
and that's why he didn't wash it
or dry it properly,

331
00:26:08,044 --> 00:26:10,020
so now it's all smelly and musty.

332
00:26:11,265 --> 00:26:15,030
Yes! It smells just like rotten socks.

333
00:26:15,030 --> 00:26:16,678
It must be from him!

334
00:26:20,767 --> 00:26:23,813
Hey, excuse me, are you
a secretary or a detective?

335
00:26:26,133 --> 00:26:27,536
You have been observing so closely.

336
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:30,435
Do you even realize you have
been charmed by Kawee?

337
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:32,717
Stop right there.

338
00:26:32,717 --> 00:26:35,912
Are you trying to be my competitor?

339
00:26:35,912 --> 00:26:39,016
Go on, get a queue number,
and join the back of the line.

340
00:26:41,041 --> 00:26:42,659
I wouldn't compete with you, Bhum.

341
00:26:43,166 --> 00:26:45,971
No matter what, I'd lose to you,
the beautiful one.

342
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:51,692
Well done. Knowing your limits is smart.

343
00:26:52,262 --> 00:26:56,375
Alright, I'll drop you off
near your place then.

344
00:27:01,079 --> 00:27:03,534
Hey, what's with your mouth?

345
00:27:04,416 --> 00:27:05,421
Hurry up!

346
00:27:05,421 --> 00:27:08,552
You got a little compliment,
and now you're acting like that?

347
00:27:25,268 --> 00:27:28,405
<i>The proof that I'm an FC of Morpheus!</i>

348
00:27:33,207 --> 00:27:35,010
Does it make me look too much like a fangirl?

349
00:27:42,545 --> 00:27:45,354
Hello, have you finished reading the contract?

350
00:27:46,873 --> 00:27:50,654
Almost done, but I just
saw the picture you sent.

351
00:27:50,654 --> 00:27:52,662
So, I couldn't resist calling the real FC.

352
00:27:54,086 --> 00:27:55,968
I doubt I'm the real one.

353
00:27:55,968 --> 00:27:58,745
I didn't even remember your face.
I really messed up.

354
00:27:59,749 --> 00:28:01,716
I didn't get a single autograph either.

355
00:28:03,213 --> 00:28:04,761
So, are you free today?

356
00:28:05,516 --> 00:28:06,559
Why?

357
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:11,164
I finished my errands early,
so I thought I'd drop by to sign for my fan.

358
00:28:11,164 --> 00:28:13,527
I'm not sure if the real fan would want it.

359
00:28:14,980 --> 00:28:16,093
Of course!

360
00:28:17,298 --> 00:28:21,748
Oh, I have a work meeting with my Boss tonight.

361
00:28:23,742 --> 00:28:24,742
It's no problem at all.

362
00:28:24,742 --> 00:28:28,856
I'll drop by to sign if you
share your location with me.

363
00:28:28,856 --> 00:28:29,858
It won't take long.

364
00:28:30,571 --> 00:28:33,542
Oh, I feel so embarrassed!

365
00:28:34,072 --> 00:28:35,948
<i>Don't worry. I'm happy to do it.</i>

366
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:37,398
Don't forget to share your location.

367
00:28:38,104 --> 00:28:39,105
Okay.

368
00:28:58,078 --> 00:28:59,472
Sorry for being late.

369
00:29:01,771 --> 00:29:03,572
It's no problem. I just got here.

370
00:29:06,493 --> 00:29:09,969
I have been thinking, in my book,
how would the female lead dress?

371
00:29:11,009 --> 00:29:12,340
But now, I think I know.

372
00:29:24,686 --> 00:29:26,779
You can use my pen.

373
00:29:26,779 --> 00:29:27,799
Here you go.

374
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,026
What are you doing messing with my people?!

375
00:29:49,465 --> 00:29:51,406
Sir, he is…

376
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:05,747
Sir! Please let go!

377
00:30:09,396 --> 00:30:10,733
Why are you doing this?

378
00:30:11,432 --> 00:30:13,026
I should be the one asking that!

379
00:30:14,032 --> 00:30:17,619
He is Mr. Morpheus, the author
I contacted for tomorrow's event.

380
00:30:20,832 --> 00:30:22,679
So, is he your favorite author?

381
00:30:23,665 --> 00:30:27,881
Yes. Without him, we wouldn't have
an author for the event.

382
00:30:30,939 --> 00:30:32,060
Cancel it.

383
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:33,064
Cancel?

384
00:30:34,264 --> 00:30:36,819
But you're the one
who approved me to contact this author!

385
00:30:36,819 --> 00:30:38,180
I said cancel it!

386
00:30:38,180 --> 00:30:40,031
Can I know why?

387
00:30:40,866 --> 00:30:43,060
Do I have to explain everything to you?

388
00:30:43,659 --> 00:30:46,776
I don't like it, I don't buy this idea.
That's it. Is that clear?

389
00:30:49,007 --> 00:30:51,500
In that case, I'll leave. Goodbye.

390
00:30:52,295 --> 00:30:53,297
Wait,

391
00:30:54,517 --> 00:30:55,939
what about our appointment?!

392
00:31:44,513 --> 00:31:46,859
Go back, sir! I don't want to talk anymore!

393
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:54,659
Food delivery!

394
00:31:57,958 --> 00:31:59,625
Mom's eating at Aunt Prim's house.

395
00:31:59,625 --> 00:32:01,659
Tell Grandpa and Aunt
Pround not to wait for me.

396
00:32:01,659 --> 00:32:05,140
Tell Grandpa, too, to eat
and not just drink beer.

397
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:08,224
If he wants beer, tell him to
wait for me to return first.

398
00:32:10,353 --> 00:32:12,623
Okay, love you!

399
00:32:14,374 --> 00:32:15,379
Love you, my dear!

400
00:32:19,068 --> 00:32:21,803
Okay, go on, tell me more!

401
00:32:23,353 --> 00:32:25,110
So, what's not the next?

402
00:32:25,110 --> 00:32:27,305
Well, that's it. I just got home.

403
00:32:32,544 --> 00:32:33,574
What?

404
00:32:33,574 --> 00:32:36,580
What? You tell me! What's going on?

405
00:32:37,395 --> 00:32:42,101
He bought a doll, took the goldfish
to the vet, and took you on a date!

406
00:32:43,811 --> 00:32:45,993
It's more than just a work relationship.

407
00:32:47,901 --> 00:32:52,174
Well, not exactly. I mean… it's just…

408
00:32:52,174 --> 00:32:54,180
Prim, putting your hands together.

409
00:32:55,881 --> 00:32:56,889
Why?

410
00:32:56,889 --> 00:32:57,939
I'm going to lecture you.

411
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:01,915
Seriously, listen to me.

412
00:33:03,166 --> 00:33:06,619
Being with a rich person is the dream!
It's a comfortable life.

413
00:33:06,619 --> 00:33:08,257
Who wouldn't want that?

414
00:33:08,257 --> 00:33:09,290
I like it, too.

415
00:33:10,509 --> 00:33:14,005
But it's too many differences when they're
too rich. It's hard to make it work.

416
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:16,320
Look at Captain Jay, my ex-husband.

417
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,006
That guy didn't even have ten million.

418
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:19,765
He couldn't make it work with me.

419
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:21,689
And your Vice President?

420
00:33:21,689 --> 00:33:24,750
With billions, such a good background,

421
00:33:24,750 --> 00:33:26,646
different lifestyle,

422
00:33:26,646 --> 00:33:27,961
and not to mention his parents.

423
00:33:28,619 --> 00:33:31,291
Do you think he will choose someone like us?

424
00:33:48,042 --> 00:33:50,306
I'm surprised you let me come to your house.

425
00:33:51,278 --> 00:33:54,289
I just want to ask you,
what do you really want?

426
00:33:55,204 --> 00:33:56,890
Is it about the book event at your mall?

427
00:33:57,971 --> 00:33:59,383
I want to help you with your work.

428
00:34:00,465 --> 00:34:03,311
Prim said if I wasn't involved,
the event would fall apart.

429
00:34:04,850 --> 00:34:06,350
I won't let it fail that easily.

430
00:34:06,943 --> 00:34:08,309
I'll figure it out.

431
00:34:10,220 --> 00:34:11,539
The event's tomorrow, right?

432
00:34:14,938 --> 00:34:17,525
Or maybe you'll just turn a blind eye
and let it get canceled.

433
00:34:19,122 --> 00:34:21,509
Is that how you run Theeranon Group?

434
00:34:23,006 --> 00:34:25,459
Letting personal issues
ruin business like this?

435
00:34:26,576 --> 00:34:28,510
If the family finds out,

436
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,230
I wonder what they'll think.

437
00:34:36,286 --> 00:34:37,366
Are you afraid?

438
00:34:39,291 --> 00:34:40,292
Afraid of what?

439
00:34:41,140 --> 00:34:43,260
Afraid that I might steal
your secretary from you.

440
00:34:49,778 --> 00:34:50,778
Not at all!

441
00:34:51,818 --> 00:34:53,998
You'll never take anything from me!

442
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:57,308
You can't escape.

443
00:34:59,671 --> 00:35:02,585
We're like siblings, and I have come back!

444
00:35:03,619 --> 00:35:05,779
I'll be following you like a shadow!

445
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:28,293
<i>What are you doing with my people?</i>

446
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:32,787
So that means you know each other?

447
00:35:34,746 --> 00:35:35,839
What are you to each other?

448
00:35:37,099 --> 00:35:38,100
Old friends?

449
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,806
<i>So, are you free to have dinner
with me tomorrow, Prim?</i>

450
00:35:59,095 --> 00:36:00,100
What should we do?

451
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,183
<i>Wait.</i>

452
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,380
<i>Follow me.</i>

453
00:37:09,860 --> 00:37:12,925
I'm sorry I couldn't help anyone.

454
00:37:12,925 --> 00:37:16,420
It's fine! Boss is the one
who called for the cancellation anyway.

455
00:37:17,349 --> 00:37:18,620
That's terrible.

456
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:21,959
Tell the venue team to keep the name tags.

457
00:37:21,959 --> 00:37:24,445
- Okay.
- Life's over. Oh no,

458
00:37:25,845 --> 00:37:27,980
Oh, I forgot to call and cancel with Kiew.

459
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:31,052
Hello, everyone. What are you all doing?

460
00:37:31,052 --> 00:37:34,306
Oh, we're grilling pork with a lot of smoke!

461
00:37:35,085 --> 00:37:37,340
Why don't you pay attention
before asking questions?

462
00:37:37,340 --> 00:37:41,094
We are sitting here feeling down
about the reading event falling through.

463
00:37:41,821 --> 00:37:42,987
Falling through?

464
00:37:42,987 --> 00:37:44,680
How? Who said that?

465
00:37:45,659 --> 00:37:46,981
Prim just told.

466
00:37:48,077 --> 00:37:50,606
But Boss called me last night
and said to keep the event going.

467
00:37:50,606 --> 00:37:51,608
What?

468
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:55,104
Yes, the Vice President called me
at 1 AM last night.

469
00:37:55,950 --> 00:37:59,106
I'm glad I didn't turn off my phone
like you taught me.

470
00:38:00,801 --> 00:38:02,929
Boss said to proceed with the event,

471
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:05,929
and told me to quickly finalize the
deal with the publisher by this morning.

472
00:38:06,497 --> 00:38:08,149
The publisher sent the contract

473
00:38:08,149 --> 00:38:11,058
and Morpheus's books to be given out
as prizes at the event.

474
00:38:13,327 --> 00:38:16,181
Is this the secret
you were talking about, Prim?

475
00:38:16,723 --> 00:38:18,739
Boss said you handled it yourself.

476
00:38:20,777 --> 00:38:21,899
If that's the case…

477
00:38:21,899 --> 00:38:23,380
Let's continue the event!

478
00:38:27,364 --> 00:38:31,514
Oh, okay, then let's break up and go.

479
00:38:31,514 --> 00:38:32,699
- Alright.
- Go get work.

480
00:38:32,699 --> 00:38:33,702
- Yeah.
- Go!

481
00:38:34,659 --> 00:38:35,739
Yeah, I'm so excited!

482
00:38:37,433 --> 00:38:39,260
What are you standing around for? Come here.

483
00:38:39,260 --> 00:38:40,261
Oh, okay.

484
00:38:43,619 --> 00:38:46,818
He told me to cancel
and then reorganize the event.

485
00:38:47,532 --> 00:38:48,585
What is going on with him?

486
00:38:53,738 --> 00:38:57,564
What? Boss ordered to change
the real decorative plants to fake ones?

487
00:38:57,564 --> 00:38:58,900
Yeah.

488
00:39:00,716 --> 00:39:04,779
Your assistant called me at 2 AM to tell me

489
00:39:04,779 --> 00:39:07,340
that your boss ordered the sudden change.

490
00:39:07,926 --> 00:39:09,127
- Really?
- Yeah.

491
00:39:09,859 --> 00:39:11,979
You must be having a tough time.

492
00:39:11,979 --> 00:39:13,198
Oh, come on, what's tough?

493
00:39:13,198 --> 00:39:16,966
Solving problems on the spot
is my specialty, you know!

494
00:39:16,966 --> 00:39:21,692
Yeah, an event without issues is smooth
but not as fun, right?

495
00:39:23,739 --> 00:39:25,020
Thanks a lot, though!

496
00:39:26,192 --> 00:39:27,913
If you need help, just let me know!

497
00:39:27,913 --> 00:39:29,761
- Could you find me a guy?
- Damn!

498
00:39:29,761 --> 00:39:31,438
- Okay, let's check the work.
- Yeah.

499
00:39:42,992 --> 00:39:44,320
You're satisfied now, huh?

500
00:39:56,380 --> 00:39:59,163
Why did you change your mind
and let Mr. Morpheus come as a guest?

501
00:40:00,452 --> 00:40:03,138
Oh, I forgot.

502
00:40:03,138 --> 00:40:05,672
The boss doesn't have to
explain everything to his subordinates.

503
00:40:06,819 --> 00:40:09,915
I thought you'd be happy that
your event had no problem.

504
00:40:09,915 --> 00:40:13,055
How can I be satisfied when you have made
things more complicated for everyone?

505
00:40:14,321 --> 00:40:17,060
Didn't you teach me to be a perfectionist?

506
00:40:17,699 --> 00:40:20,460
But is a perfectionist someone
who changes their mind like this?

507
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:22,440
This doesn't seem perfect.

508
00:40:30,406 --> 00:40:31,593
Is she mad at me?

509
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,195
Oh, my head hurts so much.

510
00:40:53,414 --> 00:40:54,874
I have never been like this before!

511
00:41:06,186 --> 00:41:07,193
Medicine.

512
00:41:12,899 --> 00:41:14,420
I don't want to take the medicine.

513
00:41:14,420 --> 00:41:18,111
Hello, doctor. My boss has a bad headache.
Is it convenient for you to meet?

514
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:20,140
It's not that bad.
No need to make an appointment.

515
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:23,330
He says it's not that bad.
Sorry for the trouble.

516
00:41:33,939 --> 00:41:38,277
The literary world and book lovers
were surprised and excited

517
00:41:38,277 --> 00:41:41,164
when the mysterious and
unseen author, Morpheus,

518
00:41:41,164 --> 00:41:44,225
revealed himself at
the Valentine's Day reading event.

519
00:41:44,225 --> 00:41:48,137
He is actually one of the heirs
of the Theerannon family.

520
00:41:48,137 --> 00:41:51,176
It has made fans very happy,
as their favorite author is not only

521
00:41:51,176 --> 00:41:54,056
talented but also handsome and wealthy,
a complete package in one person!

522
00:41:54,799 --> 00:41:58,623
And so, the young man
returns to meet the woman again

523
00:41:58,623 --> 00:42:03,744
after days, months, and years,
waiting with longing.

524
00:42:04,454 --> 00:42:07,677
But the answer from the woman will
bring him wounds that he must face.

525
00:42:07,677 --> 00:42:10,405
How many pictures have you
taken at such a rapid pace?!

526
00:42:11,020 --> 00:42:13,954
Wow, Prim! Mr. Morpheus is handsome, isn't he?

527
00:42:14,707 --> 00:42:17,220
But I definitely took fewer photos than Fa.

528
00:42:17,220 --> 00:42:19,105
Oh, don't worry about me.

529
00:42:19,105 --> 00:42:21,205
I have prepared five more devices for this.

530
00:42:25,392 --> 00:42:26,393
Just ran out of space!

531
00:42:27,345 --> 00:42:30,934
Love is like a skilled magician.

532
00:42:35,591 --> 00:42:37,420
How's it going? Any issues?

533
00:42:37,420 --> 00:42:40,011
None, but now I'm getting sleepy.

534
00:42:40,868 --> 00:42:44,485
Oh, and earlier, your Boss.

535
00:42:44,485 --> 00:42:47,877
He apologized to me for suddenly
changing the fake plants!

536
00:42:47,877 --> 00:42:49,180
- Really?
- Yeah.

537
00:42:49,180 --> 00:42:53,022
Yes, I met with Boss just now.
He apologized to me, too,

538
00:42:53,022 --> 00:42:56,044
about the sudden change of mind late at night.

539
00:42:56,912 --> 00:42:59,859
Oh, right, I also met him.

540
00:42:59,859 --> 00:43:01,260
What did he apologize to you for?

541
00:43:01,260 --> 00:43:04,222
We just met; nothing happened.
No apologies either.

542
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:24,526
There's fulfillment and satisfaction,

543
00:43:26,688 --> 00:43:27,872
but no matter what,

544
00:43:28,610 --> 00:43:33,350
love, by its very nature,
can never be denied, can it?

545
00:43:49,638 --> 00:43:50,642
Okay.

546
00:43:54,146 --> 00:43:55,705
Thank you for today's event.

547
00:43:55,705 --> 00:43:58,521
It was a lot of fun, and the fans were pleased.

548
00:43:58,521 --> 00:44:01,976
Also, thank you for signing six books for me.

549
00:44:01,976 --> 00:44:03,277
I'll take them to sell.

550
00:44:03,277 --> 00:44:04,848
If you profit, please share it with me.

551
00:44:08,594 --> 00:44:10,999
Thank you too for inviting me.

552
00:44:10,999 --> 00:44:13,317
And here's this book.

553
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:16,978
It's the first one I signed,
and you are the first one to have it.

554
00:44:18,038 --> 00:44:20,448
Is this the book that's
being released next week?

555
00:44:20,979 --> 00:44:23,478
Yes, I got it from the publisher beforehand.

556
00:44:23,478 --> 00:44:25,304
Consider it a Valentine's gift.

557
00:44:27,416 --> 00:44:28,419
Thank you!

558
00:44:36,239 --> 00:44:40,486
Your skills in apologizing
to women are terrible.

559
00:44:41,517 --> 00:44:45,493
If you come up against someone
more aggressive, you'll doubtless lose.

560
00:44:47,996 --> 00:44:51,579
What should I do? Prim won't forgive me easily.

561
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:56,085
Here's what you can try: start with this word.

562
00:44:56,085 --> 00:44:58,225
I'll give you a hint. I don't
want to say it directly.

563
00:44:59,006 --> 00:45:01,890
It starts with an 'S' and ends with a 'Y'.

564
00:45:02,505 --> 00:45:03,510
Which word?

565
00:45:06,539 --> 00:45:07,635
'Salary.'

566
00:45:07,635 --> 00:45:09,060
Damn.

567
00:45:09,060 --> 00:45:11,330
But I just gave her a bonus, man.
Isn't that enough?

568
00:45:13,094 --> 00:45:15,284
Someone like you needs
to be more straightforward.

569
00:45:15,284 --> 00:45:18,019
The first sound in this word is 'So'.

570
00:45:18,604 --> 00:45:20,353
- 'So'…
- 'So' what? So?

571
00:45:20,353 --> 00:45:21,460
- 'So'…
- 'So'?

572
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:22,993
- 'Sor'…
- 'Sor'?

573
00:45:22,993 --> 00:45:25,865
- 'Sor'…
- 'Sor'…

574
00:45:25,865 --> 00:45:26,868
'So Eu'?

575
00:45:28,053 --> 00:45:30,141
Where are you going to
play the flute for a buffalo?

576
00:45:30,141 --> 00:45:33,745
It's sorry! Sorry!
'Sorry' means 'I apologize', got it?

577
00:45:33,745 --> 00:45:35,779
Have you said it to her yet?

578
00:45:36,598 --> 00:45:37,939
- Nope.
- See?

579
00:45:40,220 --> 00:45:42,180
You want me to apologize,
but it's hard, you know?

580
00:45:43,380 --> 00:45:46,359
Between hard and bad, what do you want?

581
00:45:47,584 --> 00:45:50,705
Do you want your love life
to be as bad as mine?

582
00:45:52,419 --> 00:45:54,700
<i>You have never really
listened to anyone, have you?</i>

583
00:45:54,700 --> 00:45:57,579
<i>Yeah, you have never listened, right?</i>

584
00:45:57,579 --> 00:46:00,500
<i>If that's the case, then go
ahead, go wherever you want.</i>

585
00:46:00,500 --> 00:46:02,986
<i>- Just go, get out, get out.
- Okay.</i>

586
00:46:02,986 --> 00:46:04,895
<i>Do you dare? Do you dare?</i>

587
00:46:09,105 --> 00:46:10,626
<i>Stop, stop!</i>

588
00:46:11,820 --> 00:46:14,407
If that day I hadn't let her go,

589
00:46:15,819 --> 00:46:19,893
if that day I'd just said sorry to Ann,

590
00:46:21,192 --> 00:46:22,197
I think by now,

591
00:46:23,150 --> 00:46:25,152
Ann and I might still be together.

592
00:46:31,325 --> 00:46:32,478
Hey Thee,

593
00:46:32,478 --> 00:46:38,228
if Secretary Prim
means something important to your life,

594
00:46:39,219 --> 00:46:40,779
and if you like her,

595
00:46:40,779 --> 00:46:42,208
no matter the reason,

596
00:46:43,512 --> 00:46:45,074
can you say sorry to her?

597
00:46:46,936 --> 00:46:47,942
Hurry up.

598
00:46:48,835 --> 00:46:50,995
Say it before everything is too late;
don't be like me.

599
00:46:57,303 --> 00:46:58,808
But it's hard, man.

600
00:46:58,808 --> 00:47:00,261
What's hard about it?

601
00:47:00,261 --> 00:47:02,424
Didn't you apologize to the event organizer?

602
00:47:02,424 --> 00:47:03,906
And your secretary assistant, too?

603
00:47:04,491 --> 00:47:08,110
Saying sorry to Secretary Prim,
is that really so hard?

604
00:47:08,110 --> 00:47:11,399
How about you say sorry by spoonerism?

605
00:47:14,260 --> 00:47:19,405
If you can't say "Sorry, Secretary Prim",
then say "Sarry, Secretary Prim".

606
00:47:19,405 --> 00:47:22,739
Do you think that's funny?
What kind of nonsense is 'kodthaw'?

607
00:47:24,900 --> 00:47:26,139
I don't even know, man.

608
00:47:26,139 --> 00:47:29,846
If I'm going to apologize to Secretary Prim,
it just feels…

609
00:47:30,852 --> 00:47:33,294
Your suit pocket is still empty, huh?

610
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:37,450
You could put your obstinacy in there.

611
00:47:39,719 --> 00:47:43,853
See, it's sharp like this. You should
have figured it out already, man.

612
00:47:55,115 --> 00:47:57,925
Everyone, you can go home now.

613
00:47:57,925 --> 00:48:00,575
Go celebrate with yourselves.

614
00:48:00,575 --> 00:48:02,154
Great job!

615
00:48:03,320 --> 00:48:04,891
Are you guys leaving already?

616
00:48:07,250 --> 00:48:09,785
Bhum received a lot
of hearts from the guys, right?

617
00:48:12,107 --> 00:48:13,499
Where did Buhm get them from?

618
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:15,980
Bought them from Sampeng and stuck them on her.

619
00:48:15,980 --> 00:48:18,220
Oh, Goody! Don't act like you know everything.

620
00:48:18,220 --> 00:48:21,703
Wait, did you really buy them from
Sampeng and stick them on yourself?

621
00:48:23,371 --> 00:48:25,418
Stick them on oneself.

622
00:48:36,905 --> 00:48:38,478
It's no big deal,

623
00:48:38,478 --> 00:48:41,260
it just means you love yourself.

624
00:48:41,260 --> 00:48:43,157
It's cute.

625
00:48:45,080 --> 00:48:46,080
Who asked?

626
00:48:52,792 --> 00:48:54,072
I'm leaving now. Goodbye.

627
00:49:04,579 --> 00:49:10,174
So, this year, no guys gave flowers,
gifts, or hearts?

628
00:49:12,311 --> 00:49:14,668
Why does the statistic
keep getting worse every year?

629
00:49:16,252 --> 00:49:17,253
So sad.

630
00:49:20,265 --> 00:49:21,270
Ms. Bhum!

631
00:49:22,220 --> 00:49:23,884
Mr. Yong! What is it?

632
00:49:23,884 --> 00:49:26,000
I have something I want to give you.

633
00:49:27,645 --> 00:49:28,656
Here you go.

634
00:49:29,270 --> 00:49:30,619
What's this?

635
00:49:30,619 --> 00:49:33,035
Actually, I wanted to buy roses for you.

636
00:49:33,035 --> 00:49:34,180
But they were sold out,

637
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:38,563
so I bought them from kids
to give you some flowers.

638
00:49:41,775 --> 00:49:44,830
But you already have
someone to give them to, right?

639
00:49:49,182 --> 00:49:51,052
<i>Oh, it's fine, Mr. Yong.</i>

640
00:49:51,052 --> 00:49:54,579
<i>The handkerchief pattern is
even sweeter than mine, what a waste.</i>

641
00:49:56,171 --> 00:49:57,779
<i>PenJa crocheted it for me.</i>

642
00:49:59,213 --> 00:50:00,939
Take it to her, why give it to me?

643
00:50:02,873 --> 00:50:04,033
Well…

644
00:50:08,466 --> 00:50:09,483
What's going on?

645
00:50:10,003 --> 00:50:11,952
Well, if you don't want it

646
00:50:11,952 --> 00:50:13,680
you can offer it to the spirit shrine.

647
00:50:16,530 --> 00:50:18,670
Mr. Yong, what the heck?

648
00:50:18,670 --> 00:50:20,564
I am a human, not an ancestral shrine!

649
00:50:20,564 --> 00:50:22,444
And where's the spirit shrine in the condo?

650
00:50:25,673 --> 00:50:27,000
But it's actually cute.

651
00:50:27,640 --> 00:50:30,208
I now get the vibe of
how the spirit shrine feels.

652
00:50:30,766 --> 00:50:31,971
Adorable.

653
00:50:34,352 --> 00:50:37,455
I shouldn't be feeling this way about Mr.Yong.

654
00:50:40,754 --> 00:50:42,233
But I kind of want to show off.

655
00:50:48,576 --> 00:50:52,969
Kiew, thanks so much for helping today.

656
00:50:53,601 --> 00:50:56,069
I'll treat you to a big shabu meal.

657
00:50:56,069 --> 00:50:58,338
You pick the place you like,
and bring June along.

658
00:50:59,170 --> 00:51:01,093
Okay, see you, bye!

659
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,535
Hello, Madam Chollada.

660
00:51:06,535 --> 00:51:07,601
Hello!

661
00:51:07,601 --> 00:51:08,847
Are you here to see Boss?

662
00:51:08,847 --> 00:51:10,574
- I come to see…
- Mom!

663
00:51:10,574 --> 00:51:12,939
Oh, you're just in time!

664
00:51:16,188 --> 00:51:17,529
How's everything, dear?

665
00:51:17,529 --> 00:51:20,282
I have been busy with the ladies
from the association,

666
00:51:20,282 --> 00:51:22,650
so I couldn't come and watch
you at the event. Was it fun?

667
00:51:23,230 --> 00:51:24,371
Yes, it was great, mom.

668
00:51:25,325 --> 00:51:28,038
Thank you so much, Prim, for inviting me
to do something like this.

669
00:51:29,084 --> 00:51:30,090
I see.

670
00:51:30,944 --> 00:51:34,391
So, have you two already met?

671
00:51:36,073 --> 00:51:38,426
This is Tham, Prim.

672
00:51:38,426 --> 00:51:40,596
He's my eldest son.

673
00:51:43,695 --> 00:51:46,537
So he's the older brother of my Boss?

674
00:51:47,180 --> 00:51:49,333
Yes, I'm the real older brother of Thee.

675
00:51:52,815 --> 00:51:53,819
I almost forgot!

676
00:51:55,177 --> 00:51:56,858
Since it's Valentine's Day,

677
00:51:58,339 --> 00:51:59,832
here's a Happy Valentine's wish. Mom.

678
00:52:03,124 --> 00:52:04,660
That's so sweet of you, dear.

679
00:52:04,660 --> 00:52:09,483
Tell your dad at home to do this for me, too.

680
00:52:09,483 --> 00:52:12,373
But I don't want a sticker,
I want a diamond ring.

681
00:52:15,047 --> 00:52:16,186
Excuse me, Prim.

682
00:52:19,033 --> 00:52:20,273
Happy Valentine's.

683
00:52:23,532 --> 00:52:25,010
Happy Valentine's.

684
00:52:44,333 --> 00:52:49,408
<i>You and my older brother are the only ones
who say I have no heart.</i>

685
00:52:52,785 --> 00:52:53,794
What is this?

686
00:52:55,067 --> 00:52:57,951
Is Morpheus related to the vice president?

687
00:53:00,841 --> 00:53:02,779
You really made a huge blunder!

688
00:53:12,165 --> 00:53:17,731
<i>The longing heart waited eagerly
through nights, days, months, and years.</i>

689
00:53:17,731 --> 00:53:21,177
<i>And then, the young man returned
to meet the woman once again.</i>

690
00:53:21,798 --> 00:53:25,286
<i>Indeed, from that encounter,</i>

691
00:53:25,286 --> 00:53:30,763
<i>the young man wasn't entirely sure
whether it was fate or an accident.</i>

692
00:53:46,380 --> 00:53:48,399
<i>I'm still waiting for your answer, Prim.</i>

693
00:54:30,167 --> 00:54:31,813
Hello, good afternoon, Prim.

694
00:54:32,715 --> 00:54:34,140
Good afternoon, Dr. Tawan.

695
00:54:39,940 --> 00:54:41,280
I'm really sorry.

696
00:54:42,753 --> 00:54:45,697
It's just that I…

697
00:54:48,155 --> 00:54:49,202
It's okay.

698
00:54:49,202 --> 00:54:50,816
You don't need to say anything anymore, Prim.

699
00:54:50,816 --> 00:54:53,621
I completely understand
what you're trying to tell me.

700
00:54:56,933 --> 00:54:58,411
Thank you for understanding.

701
00:55:01,543 --> 00:55:03,694
I didn't want to waste your time.

702
00:55:07,235 --> 00:55:08,815
But we can still be friends, right?

703
00:55:09,926 --> 00:55:11,012
Of course.

704
00:55:11,772 --> 00:55:15,469
And don't forget to bring Meow Meow
to visit Ta-Pon often.

705
00:55:17,811 --> 00:55:18,816
Sure thing!

706
00:55:20,666 --> 00:55:22,711
Alright, see you soon. Goodbye.

707
00:55:25,831 --> 00:55:30,390
<i>But the answer from the woman caused
the young man more pain than any wound.</i>

708
00:55:32,193 --> 00:55:34,473
<i>He recalled the words of an older adult</i>

709
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:37,113
<i>who once told him on a night in the desert.</i>

710
00:55:38,218 --> 00:55:41,435
<i>Love is like a skilled magician</i>

711
00:55:42,075 --> 00:55:45,845
<i>who deceives us into
falling into the trap of doubt.</i>

712
00:55:46,887 --> 00:55:48,507
<i>We can never know</i>

713
00:55:49,093 --> 00:55:52,355
<i>what lies hidden under that tall hat.</i>

714
00:55:54,744 --> 00:55:58,418
I'll have to celebrate Valentine's Day
with you two, Ta-Pon.

715
00:56:01,136 --> 00:56:02,736
<i>The pain of disappointment</i>

716
00:56:03,376 --> 00:56:05,336
<i>or the joy of fulfillment,</i>

717
00:56:07,477 --> 00:56:08,685
<i>but no matter what,</i>

718
00:56:09,367 --> 00:56:13,160
<i>love is something that no one can't resist.</i>

719
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:14,160
<i>Is it not true?</i>

720
00:56:26,827 --> 00:56:27,827
Boss.

721
00:56:31,574 --> 00:56:33,455
You haven't eaten anything since lunch.

722
00:56:34,111 --> 00:56:35,311
Would you like some salad?

723
00:56:41,388 --> 00:56:44,582
If so, I'll leave it on the table for you.

724
00:56:52,711 --> 00:56:53,713
Secretary Prim.

725
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,580
Yes?

726
00:57:03,489 --> 00:57:04,489
'Sarry.'

727
00:57:06,786 --> 00:57:10,387
'Sarry'? What does that mean?

728
00:57:11,247 --> 00:57:12,680
'Sarry' means…

729
00:57:16,842 --> 00:57:21,200
No, that doesn't work. Never mind.

730
00:57:33,966 --> 00:57:34,972
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

731
00:57:40,884 --> 00:57:44,399
Wait, why are you apologizing to me?
I'm not angry at you at all.

732
00:57:46,489 --> 00:57:47,595
But I'm angry.

733
00:57:50,874 --> 00:57:51,905
But I'm not anymore.

734
00:57:57,265 --> 00:57:59,050
If that's all,

735
00:57:59,050 --> 00:58:01,885
I'll take my leave and head home now.

736
00:58:02,795 --> 00:58:03,796
Wait.

737
00:58:06,292 --> 00:58:07,367
I have something for you.

738
00:58:19,006 --> 00:58:20,045
What is it?

739
00:58:20,846 --> 00:58:22,096
Well, it's Valentine's Day.

740
00:58:22,836 --> 00:58:25,433
If it's not flowers, it should
be chocolate, right?

741
00:58:31,582 --> 00:58:32,582
Go ahead, open it.

742
00:58:46,651 --> 00:58:47,802
What are you laughing at?

743
00:58:47,802 --> 00:58:50,705
Ordering this was not easy
and took a long time.

744
00:58:53,387 --> 00:58:54,393
Let's try it.

745
00:59:12,019 --> 00:59:13,332
In that case,

746
00:59:14,352 --> 00:59:17,982
I'll take the liberty of eating your hand.

747
00:59:20,527 --> 00:59:23,527
I wouldn't mind, Secretary Prim,
even if you ate me whole.

748
00:59:42,485 --> 00:59:43,493
It's really good.

749
00:59:49,294 --> 00:59:50,294
Excuse me,

750
00:59:50,820 --> 00:59:52,306
but you have chocolate on your mouth.

751
01:01:04,282 --> 01:01:06,955
What? Tham took Prim for a meal?

752
01:01:07,564 --> 01:01:09,190
My girl, I will take care of her.

753
01:01:09,763 --> 01:01:10,944
Don't bother me.

754
01:01:10,944 --> 01:01:15,279
I think this pair of siblings
must have something.

755
01:01:15,279 --> 01:01:17,372
- Let me go. I want to go home.
- Calm down, please.

756
01:01:17,372 --> 01:01:18,518
I want to go home.

757
01:01:19,158 --> 01:01:24,145
What did you find out about
the kidnapping news 25 years ago?

758
01:01:24,145 --> 01:01:25,810
The kidnapped kid at that time

759
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:28,825
is the heir of Theeranon Group.
