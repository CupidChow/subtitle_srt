<i>Please, just for one day.</i>

00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:10,736
<i>Today, I have to find a new secretary for Boss.</i>

7
00:01:10,736 --> 00:01:12,481
<i>How will I have time to look after Ploen?</i>

8
00:01:12,481 --> 00:01:13,728
<i>You will compensate for that</i>

9
00:01:13,728 --> 00:01:16,560
<i>by training your assistant secretary to pass her probation.</i>

10
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:19,528
<i>Only then will I allow you to resign.</i>

11
00:01:19,528 --> 00:01:21,700
<i>Hi, Kawee-wee-wee!</i>

12
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:23,331
<i>Here's the logo file you asked me to design.</i>

13
00:01:23,331 --> 00:01:25,105
<i>Does anyone else smell something weird?</i>

14
00:01:25,105 --> 00:01:27,348
<i>Like a sour smell? Like damp laundry that didn't dry properly?</i>

<i>Auntie Prim! Please take a picture of me!</i>

<i>- Ploen!
- Ploen!</i>

17
00:01:31,844 --> 00:01:34,816
<i>Doing things like that is dangerous. For you and for others, too.</i>

18
00:01:34,816 --> 00:01:36,862
<i>I'm so sorry for all the trouble.</i>

19
00:01:36,862 --> 00:01:39,093
<i>Don't worry about me either. I'm quitting.</i>

20
00:01:39,093 --> 00:01:40,040

00:01:44,138 --> 00:01:47,340
<i>"You heartless jerk! You selfish bastard!" Try that sometime.</i>

25
00:01:58,797 --> 00:01:59,857
Come on, girl.

26
00:01:59,857 --> 00:02:01,739
- No!
- It's good!

27
00:02:01,739 --> 00:02:03,198
- Come on, come on!
- No.

28
00:02:03,198 --> 00:02:05,646
- Trust me, it's good! You have to try this.
- No thanks!

29
00:02:05,646 --> 00:02:07,631
Didn't you say you wanted to know about your job?

30
00:02:07,631 --> 00:02:12,476
The internet says this fortune teller has a third eye,

31
00:02:12,476 --> 00:02:15,073
super accurate!

32
00:02:15,073 --> 00:02:17,447
No way. I don't like fortune telling.

33
00:02:18,547 --> 00:02:21,836
Just let me do it. I really want to read your fortune.

34
00:02:34,134 --> 00:02:35,967
Actually, I have something urgent. I really need to go.

35
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:38,584
You want to change jobs,

36
00:02:38,584 --> 00:02:41,600
but someone is stopping you. Right?

37
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:44,540
Sit down and listen.

38
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:47,619
As for work, I suggest you stick with it for now.

39
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:52,549
When the time comes, you'll know whether to stay or move on.

40
00:02:54,046 --> 00:02:57,146
What about my friend's finances?

41
00:02:57,146 --> 00:03:00,539
Nothing to worry about. Didn't you just get your house back?

42
00:03:00,539 --> 00:03:02,099
What!

43
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,479
Prim, he's spot on. It's like he's been hiding in your attic!

44
00:03:07,479 --> 00:03:08,880
He's not a rat, you know.

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:11,140
Any of you want to ask me anything else?

46
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:14,107
Ask! Come on, ask something!

47
00:03:14,107 --> 00:03:16,320
No, I'm good.

48
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:18,500
I do!

49
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,400
When will my friend finally get a husband, Master?

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,238
Yeah!

51
00:03:21,238 --> 00:03:23,981
Let's just say boyfriend, okay?

52
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:34,110
Prim, he's staring that hard?

53
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:36,199
You'll get a husband in your next life, girl!

54
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:38,193
Nope, this life.

55
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,468
Heaven has already destined your soulmate.

56
00:03:44,468 --> 00:03:48,780
Oh my god, she's gonna get a man!

57
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,019
So has she met him already? Where is he? What does he look like?

58
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:55,099
Is he rich? What does he do? What's his cat's name? And--

59
00:03:55,099 --> 00:03:58,951
Kiew, are you asking about Prim's man or your own?

60
00:03:58,951 --> 00:04:00,755
Mine!

61
00:04:00,755 --> 00:04:05,593
If you look carefully, your soulmate is right in front of you.

62
00:04:05,593 --> 00:04:09,593
Because the red thing is holding you together.

63
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,878
The red thing?

64
00:04:14,878 --> 00:04:16,683
Yes.

65
00:04:16,683 --> 00:04:20,011
The red thing's connecting them?

66
00:04:21,142 --> 00:04:22,999
Maybe he was my man first, and now he's hers!

67
00:04:22,999 --> 00:04:25,939
- No, I think you are Prim's man!
- Pause!

68
00:04:25,939 --> 00:04:28,079
- Well, the red thing is the connection!
- He was mine first!

69
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:30,165
Nope! He's right in front of her.

70
00:04:30,165 --> 00:04:32,731
He has to be mine. He's—

71
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,925
You better be careful with your legs.

72
00:04:34,925 --> 00:04:36,620
Am I going to hurt my legs?

73
00:04:36,620 --> 00:04:38,520
No, I meant her.

74
00:04:43,213 --> 00:04:44,915
Me?

75
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,060
All right, let's go!

76
00:04:58,959 --> 00:05:01,360
That diamond is huge! Where did you buy it?

77
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,859
Oh, it's nothing. It's just a small one.

78
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,498
Wishing you great happiness and prosperity, Uncle!

79
00:05:15,498 --> 00:05:17,459
Thank you. Thank you!

80
00:05:17,459 --> 00:05:19,779
Good health to you!

81
00:05:19,779 --> 00:05:23,780
Wishing both of you only good fortune and blessings.

82
00:05:23,780 --> 00:05:25,780
- Thank you, sir.
- Thank you.

83
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:28,493
Where's Thi now?

84
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:43,600
<i>[Dad]</i>

I really wanna see your man. How hot is he going to be?

87
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,580
Yeah, Prim's about to get herself a man!

88
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,139
She's gonna have a man now!

89
00:06:03,139 --> 00:06:04,570

- Gracious and dainty, gracious and dainty!

90
00:06:04,570 --> 00:06:06,859
- Hey, keep it down!
- What?

91
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:08,717
What if that fortune-teller's not even accurate?

92
00:06:08,717 --> 00:06:10,452
Come on. Accurate or not?

93
00:06:10,452 --> 00:06:12,800
He got your job and your house right, didn't he?

94
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,120
- I bet he's right about the guy, too. Right?
- Totally.

95
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:20,136
Still want to doubt him? Miss Prim's getting a man!

96
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:25,500
Wait, Prim, are you also the secretary to your boss's dad?

97
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,301
No.

98
00:06:28,846 --> 00:06:30,713
Good day, Mr. Chairman.

99
00:06:30,713 --> 00:06:33,165
Why are you answering the phone, Prim?

100
00:06:34,945 --> 00:06:37,226
I called Thi.

101
00:06:37,226 --> 00:06:38,847
Are you with him right now?

102
00:06:38,847 --> 00:06:43,140
He may be on another call, so it got forwarded to me.

103
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:46,530
Then tell him to call me back. Urgently.

104
00:06:46,530 --> 00:06:49,880
Yes, of course. I'll get him right away, Mr. Chairman.

105
00:06:53,233 --> 00:06:55,840
He can't get a hold of his son.

106
00:06:56,552 --> 00:06:59,352
All right, let's go and find him then. You guys go and wait for me in the car first.

107
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:02,379
Then come after me, okay?

00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,000

<i>Chairman asked me to urgently remind you.</i>

111
00:07:17,587 --> 00:07:20,549
You have to attend the Chinese New Year event at home today.

00:07:20,549 --> 00:07:24,800

114
00:07:27,519 --> 00:07:30,340
Kiew! I'll call you back, sir.

115
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:34,605
What happened? Hello? Secretary Prim?

116
00:07:37,826 --> 00:07:40,859
This fortune-teller is spot-on.

117
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,624
He told Kiew she'd hurt her leg.

118
00:07:42,624 --> 00:07:46,075
And look at her now. She is a full-on Robocop!

119
00:07:47,725 --> 00:07:50,989
Who left a utility hole open like that?

120
00:07:51,615 --> 00:07:54,044
Keep your voice down!

121
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,300
Prim, if the prediction about Kiew was accurate,

122
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,964
then the one about your soulmate must be true, too!

123
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:08,540
Yes, sir?

124
00:08:08,540 --> 00:08:09,919
What just happened?

125
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,800
I had to rush to the hospital.

126
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,354
The hospital?

127
00:08:15,354 --> 00:08:17,158
Why? Are you okay?

128
00:08:17,158 --> 00:08:19,425
Oh, I'm fine.

129
00:08:19,425 --> 00:08:22,340
But my friend fell into an open utility hole.

130
00:08:22,905 --> 00:08:24,820
Quiet down!

131
00:08:24,820 --> 00:08:28,659
By the way, sir. Have you left for the event yet?

132
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:32,919
Share your hospital location with me. I'm coming to see you.

133
00:08:32,919 --> 00:08:34,240
Why?

134
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,100
<i>Just send it. Now.</i>

00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,300
Okay.

136
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,320
Hey, does Kiew want anything to drink?

137
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,775
There are many options.

138
00:08:48,775 --> 00:08:52,944
There's soda, juice, milk, coffee…

139
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:56,224
All right, I'll just grab something.

140
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,124
Okay, talk later.

143
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:19,879
No, nothing.

144
00:09:20,975 --> 00:09:22,079
Please, you go first.

145
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,599
No, after you.

146
00:09:26,132 --> 00:09:28,315
- Excuse me, please make way.
- Step aside!

147
00:09:37,625 --> 00:09:41,900
Oh, sorry! I didn't mean to grab your hand.

148
00:09:41,900 --> 00:09:43,262
It's okay.

149
00:09:43,262 --> 00:09:46,080
Excuse us, please. Don't block the way.

150
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:52,011
And this time, did you do it on purpose?

151
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:54,619
This one wasn't on purpose either.

152
00:09:55,479 --> 00:09:57,279
Thank you.

Yes, Mom. I've done everything you told me.

00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:28,100
Yes, I even burned the joss paper.

160
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:32,301

Yes.

170
00:11:02,493 --> 00:11:04,700
I thought the setup was quite creative,

171
00:11:04,700 --> 00:11:06,966

I said I wasn't here to get them, okay?

But, well, since they're giving them out, might as well take one.

178
00:11:22,458 --> 00:11:24,659
- Not like I really want it or anything.
- I see.

179
00:11:24,659 --> 00:11:25,960
Number 6, that's me.

180
00:11:25,960 --> 00:11:28,905
Hold on, Uncle. I'm number 6.

181
00:11:28,905 --> 00:11:32,500
You're number 9.

182
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:35,534
I am number 6. You are number 9.

183
00:11:35,534 --> 00:11:38,699
I'm number 6, Uncle. Don't try to trick me!

184
00:11:38,699 --> 00:11:39,939
I'm not tricking anyone!

185
00:11:39,939 --> 00:11:41,160
I'm not giving it to you!

186
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,485
- I'm not giving it either!
- Well, I'm not giving it up!

187
00:11:44,485 --> 00:11:47,406
- I'm not giving it either!
- Told you. I'm not giving it up!

188
00:11:56,899 --> 00:11:58,899
I'm done observing now.

189
00:12:00,879 --> 00:12:02,879
Would you like some tissue?

190
00:12:03,826 --> 00:12:05,630
Thank you.

191
00:12:08,322 --> 00:12:10,499
This is for your friend.

192
00:12:10,499 --> 00:12:12,551
Thank you.

193
00:12:12,551 --> 00:12:14,713
So, how's your friend doing?

194
00:12:14,713 --> 00:12:16,591
She's okay now. The doctor put her leg in a cast.

195
00:12:16,591 --> 00:12:19,691
She's sitting over there with another friend.

196
00:12:19,691 --> 00:12:23,860
That means she's being taken care of. Good. You're coming with me.

197
00:12:23,860 --> 00:12:25,009
Going where?

198
00:12:25,009 --> 00:12:26,439
To my family's Chinese New Year party.

199
00:12:26,439 --> 00:12:30,120
But isn't that a private family event?

200
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:32,912
Private? My house is full of suck-ups trying to get attention.

201
00:12:32,912 --> 00:12:35,479
Half of them weren't even invited.

202
00:12:35,479 --> 00:12:39,220
You're coming with me because I don't want to go alone.

203
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:41,300
But…

204
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:45,310
I didn't bring any clothes. What I'm wearing isn't appropriate either.

205
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:47,185
I already prepared an outfit for you.

206
00:12:48,061 --> 00:12:51,679
Where did you even get that?And how do you know my size?

207
00:12:51,679 --> 00:12:56,060
31, 24, 35.5. You wear XS. Done?

208
00:13:03,882 --> 00:13:05,545
Did you get in touch with our son?

209
00:13:05,545 --> 00:13:09,166
Yes, but I don't know if he'll actually come.

210
00:13:09,166 --> 00:13:10,920
He won't come.

211
00:13:11,852 --> 00:13:13,552
You really…

212
00:13:13,552 --> 00:13:18,612
Hello, Uncle. Hello, Auntie. Wishing you good health!

213
00:13:18,612 --> 00:13:21,004
And who did you bring with you?

214
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,099
This is Professor Meena.

215
00:13:23,099 --> 00:13:24,759
She just graduated with a degree in Economics from New York.

216
00:13:24,759 --> 00:13:28,660
She's the daughter of Professor Sanya from the Bank of Thailand.

217
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:31,300
Hello, Mr. Thawat and Mrs. Chonlada.

218
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:32,962
Hello, dear.

219
00:13:32,962 --> 00:13:35,277
I ran into her at the sports club this morning,

220
00:13:35,277 --> 00:13:38,840
so I invited her to come along and wanted her to get to know our family.

221
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:46,120
You mean "get to know our family," or get to know Thi?

222
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,820
What was that?

223
00:13:48,651 --> 00:13:50,080
I said the weather's nice today.

224
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:54,220
Yes! Feels just like Honolulu.

225
00:13:56,041 --> 00:13:58,699
There he is at last.

226
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:15,946
Hello, Dad.

227
00:14:15,946 --> 00:14:18,218
Hello, Mom.

228
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:22,500
No wonder you're late. You brought Prim along.

229
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:24,206
That's good, dear.

230
00:14:29,232 --> 00:14:31,432
Go pay respects to Uncle Lai Gong first.

231
00:14:44,786 --> 00:14:47,080
Mr. Chayanon Theeranonsakul?

232
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,160
Yes.

233
00:14:48,160 --> 00:14:51,465
The doctor has prescribed you anti-anxiety medication, sleeping pills, and vitamins.

234
00:14:51,465 --> 00:14:54,707
You can find the dosage instructions on the packages.

235
00:14:54,707 --> 00:14:57,552
And this is your follow-up appointment slip.

236
00:14:57,552 --> 00:15:00,445
- Thank you.
- Wishing you a speedy recovery.

237
00:15:10,458 --> 00:15:13,538
<i>[A Joyful Chinese New Year with My Super Happy Family.]</i>

238
00:15:20,565 --> 00:15:24,086
So, what did Uncle Lai Gong say?

239
00:15:24,086 --> 00:15:26,153
Nothing really, Dad.

240
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:32,140
Hey, Thi, are you so busy that you must bring your secretary everywhere?

241
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:35,080
I wanted to bring Prim. I don't see what's so strange about that.

242
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:38,460
Uncle Thada, you bring someone new every year, too.

243
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:45,088
You! She's not just someone! She's practically family.

244
00:15:45,088 --> 00:15:48,560
Actually, I wanted to introduce you to Meena.

245
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,109
Meena here is a university lecturer.

246
00:15:52,109 --> 00:15:54,225
The university is near the mall, too.

247
00:15:54,225 --> 00:15:57,675
You should take her to a movie sometime. Just casually.

248
00:15:57,675 --> 00:15:59,020
I don't have time.

249
00:15:59,020 --> 00:16:02,160
Spending the day working with Prim already takes up all of it.

250
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:08,700
Boss means he's so busy working with me that he has no free time.

251
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:12,890
Anyway, I'll reschedule things so he has more personal time.

252
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,180
No, that's not the case.

253
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:16,480
I like things just the way they are.

254
00:16:23,676 --> 00:16:27,953
If that's the case, I'll excuse myself. Good day.

255
00:16:33,175 --> 00:16:36,849
Well then, let's talk about Meena, shall we?

256
00:16:44,665 --> 00:16:48,940
Secretary Prim, where are you going?

257
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:52,240
I know you brought me here to be a shield,

258
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:54,360
to avoid being set up.

259
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:56,390
But you also know that doing this

260
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:59,290
might make your relatives look down on me.

261
00:17:00,049 --> 00:17:02,455
Let them. I don't care.

262
00:17:02,495 --> 00:17:07,040
But I care. What you're doing isn't very considerate.

263
00:17:12,772 --> 00:17:15,007
Please excuse me. I'm going to leave now.

264
00:17:41,595 --> 00:17:44,500
Who was that? The woman who just got into the taxi?

265
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:46,760
I really want to see her face.

266
00:17:46,760 --> 00:17:48,639
None of your business.

267
00:17:52,858 --> 00:17:57,459
Tham! How have you been?

268
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:00,100
Hello, Dad. Hello, Mom.

269
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:04,759
Hey there. Go pay respects to Lai Kong first.

270
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:07,500
- Come on.
- Let's go.

271
00:18:08,665 --> 00:18:10,505
Hello, Grandpa.

272
00:18:11,417 --> 00:18:14,479
What wind blew you back here?

273
00:18:16,639 --> 00:18:19,040
My new book is being launched in Thailand,

274
00:18:19,040 --> 00:18:21,272
so the publisher invited me over.

275
00:18:21,272 --> 00:18:24,106
I wanted to visit everyone while I was here.

276
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:27,646
And your illness? Are you better now?

277
00:18:33,777 --> 00:18:38,047
Are you hungry, Tham? Let's go and get you something to eat.

278
00:18:43,249 --> 00:18:48,726
Never thought I'd see Thi. I mean, Tham again.

279
00:18:48,726 --> 00:18:51,288
Exactly. And who knows if he's really recovered?

280
00:18:51,288 --> 00:18:56,120
I can still picture that scene when he was a kid and went crazy.

281
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,020
Yes!

282
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:02,168
Right? He's the heir of the main family branch,

283
00:19:02,168 --> 00:19:05,859
yet one brother got sick, and the other doesn't even have a wife or kids.

284
00:19:05,859 --> 00:19:11,959
If the secondary branches take over the family business, that's tragic.

285
00:19:11,959 --> 00:19:13,464
Exactly.

286
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:20,302
Do you smell something around here?

287
00:19:21,596 --> 00:19:26,892
Smells like rotting garbage or something. Makes my throat bitter.

288
00:19:29,359 --> 00:19:31,453
- What smell?
- Let me smell.

289
00:19:32,374 --> 00:19:35,399
What is it, sis-in-law? He said it smelled like garbage.

290
00:19:37,864 --> 00:19:39,320
I'll wait in the car.

291
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:40,820
Okay.

292
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,546
Aren't you going to talk to me at all?

293
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:04,145
No.

294
00:20:05,879 --> 00:20:09,322
I didn't just come back because of the book launch.

295
00:20:09,322 --> 00:20:11,179
I came back because of you.

296
00:20:12,234 --> 00:20:14,052
And what does that have to do with me?

297
00:20:16,825 --> 00:20:18,846
I came to forgive you.

298
00:20:21,946 --> 00:20:25,245
Even though what happened that day still haunts me,

299
00:20:25,245 --> 00:20:28,269
to keep being angry and resentful at my own younger brother

300
00:20:28,269 --> 00:20:30,740
only brings me pain.

301
00:20:30,740 --> 00:20:34,300
So I decided I was going to forgive you.

302
00:20:41,493 --> 00:20:43,193
Are you done?

303
00:21:00,350 --> 00:21:02,500
<i>[Happy Birthday]</i>

304
00:21:12,234 --> 00:21:13,639
Happy birthday!

305
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:15,739
Thank you! Thank you so much!

306
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:21,212
Girl, that sweetness is bursting through the cast!

307
00:21:22,932 --> 00:21:25,040
My friends, I'm dying over here.

308
00:21:25,040 --> 00:21:26,699
Dying of laughter or jealousy?

309
00:21:26,699 --> 00:21:29,184
What's there to be jealous of?

310
00:21:29,184 --> 00:21:34,486
My man's at home right now, snoring and farting in his sleep.

311
00:21:34,486 --> 00:21:40,253
But you, Prim, come on, your boss brought you to meet the whole family!

312
00:21:40,253 --> 00:21:44,053
Does he like you? Is there something there?

313
00:21:44,053 --> 00:21:45,370
No way.

314
00:21:45,370 --> 00:21:50,700
A guy like him only thinks about work and his own perfection.

315
00:21:51,319 --> 00:21:54,980
And here I thought you were going to meet your soulmate today.

316
00:21:58,665 --> 00:22:01,949
<i>Your soulmate is right in front of you.</i>

317
00:22:01,949 --> 00:22:05,846
<i>The red object ties your fates together.</i>

318
00:22:08,113 --> 00:22:09,239
Or maybe…

319
00:22:09,239 --> 00:22:11,526
Maybe what?

320
00:22:16,800 --> 00:22:18,626
Sorry! I didn't mean to scare you.

321
00:22:18,626 --> 00:22:22,758
Sausage. The one I brought couldn't swim and somehow fell into the water.

322
00:22:23,387 --> 00:22:25,287
It's okay.

323
00:22:30,111 --> 00:22:33,760
Red shirt. He's wearing red.

324
00:22:36,394 --> 00:22:39,140
He must be your soulmate.

325
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,854
Oh hey, Tawan! I thought you weren't coming.

326
00:22:46,854 --> 00:22:51,379
This is June and Prim, and this is Dr. Tawan, my boyfriend's friend.

327
00:23:11,105 --> 00:23:13,752
Don't mess this one up, okay?

328
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:22,367
And don't forget to let my company plan your wedding, okay?

329
00:23:22,367 --> 00:23:23,589
Oh my god!

330
00:23:23,589 --> 00:23:28,200
No more "Oh my god"! This guy is top-tier good-looking, with a great profile.

331
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,998
Hesitate, and you'll miss the promo, girl!

332
00:23:30,998 --> 00:23:33,219
Now go, go! Seal the deal! Get moving!

333
00:23:54,020 --> 00:23:56,470
<i>Is she mad at me?</i>

334
00:23:56,470 --> 00:23:59,120
<i>Yeah, probably. It's all over her face.</i>

335
00:23:59,120 --> 00:24:01,619
<i>And what's she doing now, anyway?</i>

336
00:24:06,690 --> 00:24:08,497
<i>Where are you?</i>

337
00:24:14,580 --> 00:24:17,659
Well, at least I've gotten to know a vet.

338
00:24:17,659 --> 00:24:19,700
In case something ever happens to my goldfish,

339
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,241
I can ask Dr. Tawan to treat it.

340
00:24:23,036 --> 00:24:24,800
So you're free today, Prim?

341
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:29,627
Kiew told me your boss works you really hard, like 24/7.

342
00:24:29,627 --> 00:24:32,051
Like a slave, she said.

343
00:24:40,177 --> 00:24:43,640
Kiew talks about me, too?

344
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,450
It's not that bad. I actually enjoy work.

345
00:24:47,450 --> 00:24:51,340
Though, it can be stressful sometimes.

346
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,820
Every job is stressful,

347
00:24:53,820 --> 00:24:57,400
but I talk to Bug-Eyes when I feel a little stressed.

348
00:24:57,403 --> 00:24:58,779
Bug-Eyes?

349
00:24:58,779 --> 00:25:03,700
Yeah. There's this goldfish at my clinic. His name is Bug-Eyes.

350
00:25:05,037 --> 00:25:08,560
But if you're really stressed, Prim, try this.

351
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,360
I'm fine, damn it!

352
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:12,560
Try it!

353
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:19,604
- I'm fine, damn it!
- I'm fine, damn it!

354
00:25:22,246 --> 00:25:24,980
Are they soulmates or what?

355
00:25:28,909 --> 00:25:30,975
<i>What are you doing?</i>

356
00:25:32,530 --> 00:25:35,519
<i>What are you doing?</i>

357
00:25:35,519 --> 00:25:38,679
Even if I text her, she still ghosts me.

358
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,491
<i>[K]</i>

359
00:25:46,491 --> 00:25:51,753
<i>Just the letter "K"? What's that supposed to mean?</i>

360
00:25:51,753 --> 00:25:55,100
What the heck did I just send?

361
00:25:56,860 --> 00:26:00,957
How could someone as perfect as me accidentally send the wrong message?

362
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:09,380
Or I could mess with her a little, confuse her for fun.

363
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:16,399
Is something wrong?

364
00:26:20,953 --> 00:26:27,440
What does that mean if someone sends the letter "K"?

365
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:33,756
If someone comments just "K" on social media,

366
00:26:33,756 --> 00:26:36,180
it usually means…

367
00:26:38,673 --> 00:26:44,086
Did you upset someone enough for them to send that kind of message?

368
00:26:45,739 --> 00:26:50,850
Maybe. I've made him mad a few times lately.

369
00:26:50,850 --> 00:26:54,487
But I don't think he's the type to say something that rude.

370
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,562
Well, it depends on who sent it.

371
00:26:57,562 --> 00:27:00,492
Do you have a boyfriend?

372
00:27:02,462 --> 00:27:05,269
It could mean he misses you.

373
00:27:06,257 --> 00:27:09,405
Pretty sure it's not that guy.

374
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:13,399
So, not that meaning, or no boyfriend?

375
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:16,785
Neither.

376
00:27:21,250 --> 00:27:25,979
What's going on? She won't text me back, won't call…

377
00:27:27,831 --> 00:27:29,532
This isn't fun anymore.

378
00:27:29,532 --> 00:27:31,500
It could be a typo, or he hit the wrong button,

379
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:33,900
or sent it to the wrong person.

380
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:38,614
Or maybe he's so sick he didn't have the energy to type anything more.

381
00:27:39,239 --> 00:27:40,940
Sick?

382
00:27:44,712 --> 00:27:46,480
I need to go run an errand. Excuse me.

383
00:27:46,480 --> 00:27:47,786
Sure.

384
00:28:02,297 --> 00:28:04,244
Hello.

385
00:28:05,466 --> 00:28:08,779
Boss, are you okay? You sound weird.

386
00:28:08,779 --> 00:28:10,790
I…

387
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,460
Are you sick?

388
00:28:12,460 --> 00:28:13,890
I…

389
00:28:17,180 --> 00:28:19,180
Secretary Prim. Don't—

390
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:21,810
Oh my gosh. Boss, please hang in there!

391
00:28:21,810 --> 00:28:24,300
I'll call an ambulance right now!

392
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:25,706
<i>Hold on just a second!</i>

393
00:28:25,706 --> 00:28:27,595
Secretary Prim… Secretary…

394
00:28:31,953 --> 00:28:33,696
What the heck is going on?

395
00:28:39,762 --> 00:28:42,575
Wait, does Prim really think I'm actually sick?

396
00:28:42,575 --> 00:28:45,727
Guess I'll have to keep playing along.

397
00:28:47,557 --> 00:28:49,979
Prim… I don't know what's wrong with me…

398
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:53,119
Nope. Doesn't work.

399
00:28:57,132 --> 00:29:02,639
Prim… my heart hurts… I can't breathe…

400
00:29:04,132 --> 00:29:08,258
Still not working. Feels too fake.

401
00:29:11,130 --> 00:29:12,636
Slipped and fell!

402
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:23,594
What am I even doing?

403
00:29:23,594 --> 00:29:25,620
This is so stupid…

404
00:29:27,592 --> 00:29:30,071
Now I have to clean this mess up, too.

405
00:29:38,006 --> 00:29:40,086
What even is this…

406
00:29:41,056 --> 00:29:42,963
Boss!

407
00:29:42,963 --> 00:29:44,160
Are you okay?

408
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:46,953
- Secretary Prim…
- Don't say anything.

409
00:29:46,953 --> 00:29:49,539
Someone, please come in quickly!

410
00:29:52,321 --> 00:29:54,033
Secretary Prim…

411
00:29:58,371 --> 00:30:00,237
I can't believe I fell for that, Boss.

412
00:30:00,237 --> 00:30:04,644
If I had suspected something from the start,none of this mess would've happened.

413
00:30:04,644 --> 00:30:06,632
I didn't think that just sending one letter

414
00:30:06,632 --> 00:30:09,466
just a single "K" would make you worry this much…

415
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:13,329
So what does one "K" even mean?

416
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,409
It didn't mean anything. I just wanted to talk to you.

417
00:30:24,390 --> 00:30:27,503
I wanted to talk about work. And just as I was typing,

418
00:30:27,503 --> 00:30:30,088
I realized that maybe I shouldn't bother my staff on their day off…

419
00:30:30,088 --> 00:30:32,799
But my finger slipped, and it sent.

420
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,870
So, what was it you wanted to talk about?

421
00:30:37,870 --> 00:30:39,660
What were—

422
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:44,799
That request we got about filming a series at our mall.

423
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:47,950
I scheduled tomorrow's site visit with the location team

424
00:30:47,950 --> 00:30:49,669
and corporate communications.

425
00:30:49,669 --> 00:30:54,180
What about the Valentine's Day event we're organizing? How's that going?

426
00:30:54,180 --> 00:30:55,920
I've had Mind prepare the full presentation already.

427
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:58,000
And the birthday gift for the German ambassador?

428
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,520
That's all taken care of, too.

429
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:00,939
And before all this, what were you up to?

430
00:31:00,939 --> 00:31:03,805
- I was on a date.
- A date?

431
00:31:03,805 --> 00:31:06,119
With who?

432
00:31:06,119 --> 00:31:07,900
You're joking, right?

433
00:31:08,812 --> 00:31:12,431
If you're feeling better now, I'll be heading home.

434
00:31:12,431 --> 00:31:13,926
Wait…

435
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,745
Thank you.

436
00:31:20,745 --> 00:31:24,750
If it wasn't you, I don't think anyone else would've cared this much about me.

437
00:31:34,339 --> 00:31:39,519
So, what does that single "K" really mean?

438
00:31:40,599 --> 00:31:41,780
I'm sleepy now.

439
00:31:41,780 --> 00:31:45,970
Tell the doctor I want to be discharged early tomorrow morning.

440
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,920
Wait, hold on!

441
00:32:20,366 --> 00:32:22,570
That's it. Very good. Hmm,

442
00:32:22,570 --> 00:32:25,765
Hmm, you're a fast learner.

443
00:32:25,765 --> 00:32:27,090
Thank you, Prim.

444
00:32:27,090 --> 00:32:29,430
So, do we have anything else today?

445
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:31,760
Okay.

446
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:37,220
Let's go over the contract details next.

447
00:32:40,505 --> 00:32:43,498
That many?

448
00:32:43,498 --> 00:32:45,059
That's just half of it.

449
00:32:45,059 --> 00:32:46,873
Half?

450
00:32:47,544 --> 00:32:49,924
- Good morning, Boss.
- Good morning, Boss.

451
00:32:49,924 --> 00:32:52,213
Do I have a meeting with the Chamber of Commerce today?

452
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:56,200
Yes, and there are documents for you to sign.

453
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:00,230
Mind, could you check with the legal team

454
00:33:00,230 --> 00:33:02,579
if there are any other contracts for Boss to sign?

455
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:05,606
- We could get them all done at once.
- Oh, sure.

456
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:14,120
<i>[Deputy Chief Executive Officer: Cholothorn Thiranonwakul]</i>

457
00:33:15,364 --> 00:33:20,050
So, what did that message mean?

458
00:33:25,392 --> 00:33:27,402
Can I not tell?

459
00:33:35,772 --> 00:33:37,580
77 provinces, times two.

460
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,890
Yup, that's how many men have hit on me.

461
00:33:41,892 --> 00:33:44,192
Lying since you were a kid, huh?

462
00:33:44,192 --> 00:33:45,437
What do you mean by "lying since I was a kid"?

463
00:33:45,437 --> 00:33:49,858
- You are so…
- Not lying, totally accurate! No exaggeration.

464
00:33:50,819 --> 00:33:55,180
Hey, newbie, something on your mind?

465
00:33:55,916 --> 00:33:58,479
It's just that I…

466
00:33:58,479 --> 00:33:59,999
That you what? Come on, tell us!

467
00:33:59,999 --> 00:34:02,105
Yeah, spill it!

468
00:34:02,105 --> 00:34:07,420
I…

469
00:34:11,155 --> 00:34:13,515
Never mind. I won't ask.

470
00:34:14,700 --> 00:34:16,224
- Come on, ask!
- Yeah!

471
00:34:16,224 --> 00:34:18,280
From the look of it, this is going to be interesting.

472
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:19,459
- Totally.
- Ask away!

473
00:34:19,459 --> 00:34:20,960
- Yeah.
- Come on.

474
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:22,665
Just ask already.

475
00:34:25,708 --> 00:34:28,060
So, who is that person?

476
00:34:28,947 --> 00:34:30,032
Who?

477
00:34:30,032 --> 00:34:32,359
Your date.

478
00:34:33,712 --> 00:34:35,812
Not telling either.

479
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:48,700
I was just wondering if Prim and Boss are…

480
00:34:51,074 --> 00:34:53,274
are…

481
00:34:56,287 --> 00:34:57,364
Never mind.

482
00:34:57,364 --> 00:35:00,140
I can't take this! Are you going to ask or not?!

483
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,180
Ask or not?!

484
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,339
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

485
00:35:02,339 --> 00:35:04,820
- Too much stalling!
- Wait! Calm down!

486
00:35:04,820 --> 00:35:06,996
What evil spirit possessed you just now? Gosh!

487
00:35:06,996 --> 00:35:08,080
Just ask already!

488
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:10,385
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

489
00:35:10,385 --> 00:35:12,347
I…

490
00:35:12,347 --> 00:35:19,310
I was just wondering if Prim and Boss are

491
00:35:19,310 --> 00:35:21,610
dating or something?

492
00:35:21,610 --> 00:35:24,900
When I see them together,

493
00:35:24,900 --> 00:35:30,719
they've got chemistry like a leading couple in a series or something.

494
00:35:43,118 --> 00:35:46,526
Oh, honey, let me tell you something.

495
00:35:46,526 --> 00:35:49,699
If those two were to date, they'd have done it long ago!

496
00:35:49,699 --> 00:35:53,160
- True!
- Yeah, and now Prim's about to resign!

497
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:56,290
- If I were dating Boss, would I be quitting?
- Exactly!

498
00:35:56,290 --> 00:35:58,730
So I'm telling you. Those two? No way.

499
00:35:58,730 --> 00:36:00,930
Definitely not.

500
00:36:00,934 --> 00:36:02,819
True.

501
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:05,674
Were you trying to ship Boss and Secretary Prim?

502
00:36:05,674 --> 00:36:09,100
Careful, that ship might sink.

503
00:36:10,738 --> 00:36:14,395
But if you want to switch ships

504
00:36:14,395 --> 00:36:18,097
and make it me and Boss instead.

505
00:36:18,890 --> 00:36:22,000
You'll be swooning way harder, I guarantee it!

506
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:24,650
Hahaha! Right?

507
00:36:26,665 --> 00:36:29,717
Wait, where did everyone go?

508
00:36:32,020 --> 00:36:33,940
The front courtyard can be shot from about this angle.

509
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:37,519
As for the filming details, I'll leave that to Namwan to handle.

510
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:39,500
Sure. This way, please.

511
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:41,102
Thank you.

512
00:36:44,460 --> 00:36:46,160
Prim.

513
00:36:46,160 --> 00:36:48,119
Doctor Tawan!

514
00:36:54,120 --> 00:36:56,280
Fah, move quickly!

515
00:36:59,333 --> 00:37:00,720
Fah!

516
00:37:01,335 --> 00:37:03,008
Fah!

517
00:37:03,008 --> 00:37:04,352
Fah!

518
00:37:04,352 --> 00:37:06,347
- Here, hide over here!
- Oh, OK.

519
00:37:06,347 --> 00:37:07,460
Here.

520
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,161
Here what?

521
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:14,659
Hide from Prim?

522
00:37:14,659 --> 00:37:17,180
Wait, but why are we hiding?

523
00:37:17,964 --> 00:37:22,260
Whenever I get flustered like this, I always forget my phone.

524
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:24,150
Fah, take a photo!

525
00:37:24,150 --> 00:37:25,624
Okay.

526
00:37:29,558 --> 00:37:32,258
No, not "okay" like that!

527
00:37:32,258 --> 00:37:33,829
Okay.

528
00:37:36,904 --> 00:37:38,951
I meant take that photo!

529
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:41,730
That one? Of Prim?

530
00:37:41,730 --> 00:37:43,140
Why, though, Boss?

531
00:37:43,140 --> 00:37:46,836
Just do it! Quickly!

532
00:37:46,836 --> 00:37:49,665
Is that even okay? That's a violation of personal rights.

533
00:37:49,665 --> 00:37:51,980
It could be illegal under PDPA.

534
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:55,060
But for you, Boss, I'll do it.

535
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:57,068
I'm thrilled to see you again.

536
00:37:57,068 --> 00:37:58,367
The other day, when you rushed off,

537
00:37:58,367 --> 00:38:00,840
there wasn't anything serious going on, was there?

538
00:38:00,840 --> 00:38:04,164
No. Just a small misunderstanding.

539
00:38:04,164 --> 00:38:05,780
Nothing serious.

540
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,620
But even if it were serious…

541
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,920
I'm fine, damn it!

542
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,100
Good afternoon!

543
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,300
What a refreshing breeze, beautiful skies,

544
00:38:24,300 --> 00:38:28,180
the clouds lined up so nicely,

545
00:38:28,180 --> 00:38:31,020
such a relaxing shade of blue!

546
00:38:31,020 --> 00:38:33,160
Why are you giving me a weather report?

547
00:38:33,160 --> 00:38:36,529
True! Why bother with the sky

548
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:39,846
when the real view is on your phone screen?

549
00:38:48,840 --> 00:38:50,032
Who is that?

550
00:38:50,032 --> 00:38:55,164
"Who is that?" is exactly…

551
00:38:57,746 --> 00:38:59,828
the right question!

552
00:38:59,828 --> 00:39:01,963
Yes! Who is that?

553
00:39:01,963 --> 00:39:06,075
Friend or boyfriend?

554
00:39:06,075 --> 00:39:08,366
<i>Well, someday I'll have a family, too.</i>

555
00:39:08,366 --> 00:39:13,141
<i>I may get married immediately if I meet the right person.</i>

556
00:39:16,133 --> 00:39:20,773
Could you switch the camera to horizontal mode?

557
00:39:20,773 --> 00:39:26,332
Rotate the phone. Yes, and zoom out.

558
00:39:26,332 --> 00:39:29,751
Do you know how to zoom out? Yeah, zoom out. Hehe.

559
00:39:40,226 --> 00:39:44,779
Give me that phone back. This thing's not fully paid off yet!

560
00:39:45,411 --> 00:39:48,146
"Who is that?" feels exactly...

561
00:39:48,146 --> 00:39:51,136
like your heart just dropped to the floor?

562
00:39:51,136 --> 00:39:52,200
Who's shocked?

563
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:54,102
I'm not shocked.

564
00:39:54,102 --> 00:39:57,451
She can talk to whoever she wants. It's none of my business.

565
00:39:57,451 --> 00:40:01,400
You're the one meddling. Why are you even taking her picture?

566
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,800
Or are you just wasting work hours doing nonsense?

567
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,200
Want to resign, too?

568
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:06,820
I'll sign your resignation anytime. You want that?

569
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:10,200
Boss, sir! Please don't say that. That's scary.

570
00:40:10,200 --> 00:40:13,186
Okay, I'll delete the picture right now.

571
00:40:13,186 --> 00:40:17,940
So you won't have to worry anymore.

572
00:40:17,940 --> 00:40:20,819
You won't have to be annoyed by this kind of stuff again.

573
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:25,555
Okay, I'll go back to work now. I'm suddenly feeling super motivated!

574
00:40:25,555 --> 00:40:27,322
I'm off!

575
00:40:46,050 --> 00:40:48,132
<i>Why did I even come here?</i>

576
00:40:48,831 --> 00:40:50,799
<i>This is getting out of hand.</i>

577
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:12,600
She's not answering her phone.

578
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,872
It's so late, and she's not at the condo yet.

579
00:41:14,872 --> 00:41:16,980
Where are you, Secretary Prim?

580
00:41:22,965 --> 00:41:24,665
Who is she with?

581
00:41:29,060 --> 00:41:31,240
That's a man.

582
00:41:32,238 --> 00:41:34,512
Thanks for giving me a ride.

583
00:41:34,512 --> 00:41:37,013
Hope to see you again soon.

584
00:41:37,013 --> 00:41:38,414
No.

585
00:41:39,558 --> 00:41:40,964
No.

586
00:41:42,180 --> 00:41:46,892
No, no!

587
00:41:46,892 --> 00:41:48,495
Sure.

588
00:41:55,093 --> 00:41:57,465
Secretary Prim!

589
00:41:57,465 --> 00:41:59,267
Boss!

590
00:42:01,131 --> 00:42:05,060
This is the Vice President, my boss.

591
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:08,407
Did you catch that? "My boss". Did you hear that clearly?

592
00:42:08,407 --> 00:42:10,634
Oh, yes.

593
00:42:10,634 --> 00:42:15,479
"Prim's boss." I heard it loud and clear.

594
00:42:17,499 --> 00:42:21,320
This is Dr. Tawan. He's a friend of mine.

595
00:42:21,320 --> 00:42:24,399
Also "of mine".

596
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:31,148
Prim's "friend."

597
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:37,027
Well then, Prim's "friend," please go ahead and leave.

598
00:42:37,027 --> 00:42:41,000
I have something to discuss with "my person".

599
00:42:43,425 --> 00:42:45,230
See you again.

600
00:42:45,999 --> 00:42:47,401
Okay.

601
00:43:04,139 --> 00:43:06,093
Is something wrong, Boss?

602
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,546
"Yes."

603
00:43:13,080 --> 00:43:16,405
I'm really disappointed in you, Secretary Prim.

604
00:43:16,405 --> 00:43:18,726
And what exactly were you expecting from me?

605
00:43:20,759 --> 00:43:23,419
Did I leave work unfinished?

606
00:43:26,838 --> 00:43:29,300
Or is it about Dr. Tawan?

607
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:33,802
Stop right there! Don't start imagining things.

608
00:43:33,802 --> 00:43:36,130
Why would I care if you went on a date...

609
00:43:37,272 --> 00:43:39,496
with some guy I don't know?

610
00:43:39,496 --> 00:43:41,199
That doesn't make sense!

611
00:43:42,120 --> 00:43:44,860
Are you mad because I went on a date?

612
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:52,220
Forget that. I came here because I have something for you.

613
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:06,880
This is for you, as an apology for the chaos I caused yesterday.

614
00:44:13,710 --> 00:44:15,770
I get it.

615
00:44:15,770 --> 00:44:19,170
You're touched by the small things I do for you, right?

616
00:44:25,279 --> 00:44:28,779
Wait, are you allergic to pollen?

617
00:44:32,579 --> 00:44:34,181
Yes.

618
00:44:37,086 --> 00:44:40,206
I never knew. You didn't tell me.

619
00:44:40,206 --> 00:44:43,173
Well, you didn't ask.

620
00:44:43,173 --> 00:44:47,479
And I don't really like sharing personal stuff with people anyway.

621
00:44:47,479 --> 00:44:52,076
<i>So she wasn't crying when I gave the flowers to Jinny?</i>

622
00:44:52,076 --> 00:44:54,479
<i>She wasn't upset?</i>

623
00:44:54,479 --> 00:44:55,979
<i>That means she doesn't have feelings for me?</i>

624
00:44:55,979 --> 00:44:59,140
<i>No, that sneeze was a clever way to hide her pain.</i>

625
00:44:59,140 --> 00:45:01,670
<i>She's hiding it too well!</i>

626
00:45:03,971 --> 00:45:05,946
Boss, are you okay?

627
00:45:09,419 --> 00:45:12,159
We've worked together for nine years,

628
00:45:12,159 --> 00:45:14,903
but I don't know you.

629
00:45:15,792 --> 00:45:17,841
And now that I finally want to,

630
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:19,846
you're about to leave.

631
00:45:21,220 --> 00:45:24,463
I must be a terrible boss.

632
00:45:26,085 --> 00:45:30,532
Not at all. You've always been someone I respect.

633
00:45:30,532 --> 00:45:34,900
But at least now, you finally know I'm allergic to pollen. Right?

634
00:45:50,380 --> 00:45:55,257
Thank you for the flowers. But I think I'll have to stop here.

635
00:46:27,120 --> 00:46:29,829
You're funny, Boss.

636
00:46:33,686 --> 00:46:38,086
When he grows up, will the prince be as funny as you?

637
00:46:46,300 --> 00:46:49,916
<i>[Sleep well, "my prince."]</i>

638
00:46:50,609 --> 00:46:53,482
<i>I have to go home now.</i>

639
00:46:53,482 --> 00:46:56,441
<i>Can't you stay, Prince?</i>

640
00:46:56,441 --> 00:47:00,229
<i>I can't. But I'll come back to play with you again.</i>

641
00:47:00,229 --> 00:47:02,988
<i>Really? You promise?</i>

642
00:47:02,988 --> 00:47:05,154
<i>My name is…</i>

643
00:47:17,630 --> 00:47:20,865
So what was the prince's name again?

644
00:47:20,865 --> 00:47:23,358
I can never remember.

645
00:47:32,710 --> 00:47:34,120
<i>[Thiranon Group]</i>

646
00:47:34,120 --> 00:47:35,400
Secretary Prim!

647
00:47:35,400 --> 00:47:38,550
Secretary Prim! Secretary Prim!

648
00:47:39,145 --> 00:47:40,185
What's wrong, Boss?

649
00:47:40,185 --> 00:47:43,320
Take them off! Get them out! I said get them out!

650
00:47:46,320 --> 00:47:48,647
I said get them out!

651
00:47:59,007 --> 00:48:02,466
I already took them off. It's okay now.

652
00:48:04,559 --> 00:48:08,485
Who did this?! I told you not to let me see them!

653
00:48:08,485 --> 00:48:10,599
Who did this?!

654
00:48:11,258 --> 00:48:13,250
I forgot to check it myself.

655
00:48:13,250 --> 00:48:15,203
I'm sorry.

656
00:48:30,720 --> 00:48:34,430
Didn't I tell you not to keep cable ties in Boss's office?

657
00:48:34,430 --> 00:48:36,860
Why don't you remember?

658
00:48:36,860 --> 00:48:39,485
I'm sorry, Prim.

659
00:48:39,485 --> 00:48:42,647
I promise I won't let this happen again.

660
00:48:58,630 --> 00:49:02,594
You're a secretary. Don't cry in front of the boss.

661
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:07,603
Okay.

662
00:49:07,603 --> 00:49:09,810
Go wash your face.

663
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:14,219
Then we can go and grab something to eat.

664
00:49:18,565 --> 00:49:20,405
Thank you.

665
00:49:44,070 --> 00:49:46,559
Pandan leaf tea.

666
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:51,160
The scent of pandan will help you relax, Boss.

667
00:49:53,367 --> 00:49:55,201
I'm really sorry.

668
00:49:55,201 --> 00:49:59,100
I'll be more careful and not let anything like this happen again.

669
00:50:01,622 --> 00:50:05,839
But you're leaving soon. How can you guarantee that?

670
00:50:12,364 --> 00:50:16,430
But I'm still here now, and I'll do my very best while I am.

671
00:50:38,790 --> 00:50:42,092
I feel better now. Thank you.

672
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:47,284
Yeah, you have the monthly volleyball match this evening.

673
00:50:48,390 --> 00:50:49,903
Yes.

674
00:50:54,570 --> 00:50:57,620
No matter how much you try manifesting your luck,

675
00:50:57,620 --> 00:51:00,100
you'll never beat my fate! I pick Prim.

676
00:51:00,100 --> 00:51:03,414
You can have the new girl.

677
00:51:03,414 --> 00:51:06,395
Prim! You're on my team.

678
00:51:06,395 --> 00:51:08,186
Okay!

679
00:51:10,760 --> 00:51:14,655
Now it's my turn. Someone like you…

680
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:19,034
And, Pink, are you joining? What role are you playing, sweetie?

681
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:22,154
I didn't have time to get a proper shirt.

682
00:51:22,940 --> 00:51:25,058
Even without the right outfit.

683
00:51:28,130 --> 00:51:33,683
Is it always this serious when they play volleyball here?

684
00:51:34,580 --> 00:51:37,494
Well, it used to be just for fun at the start of every month.

685
00:51:37,494 --> 00:51:40,931
But after Bhum and Goody started taking turns winning and losing,

686
00:51:40,931 --> 00:51:43,875
it got more competitive.

687
00:51:43,875 --> 00:51:45,940
At first, it was about staying healthy.

688
00:51:45,940 --> 00:51:48,140
Later, it turned deadly serious.

689
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,052
Who the heck wears a leather jacket to play volleyball?

690
00:52:01,052 --> 00:52:02,633
I heard that.

691
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:11,962
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

692
00:52:12,790 --> 00:52:17,151
This round, we will avenge our loss from the last match!

693
00:52:17,151 --> 00:52:20,579
We're going to crush Bhum's gang and stomp them into the ground!

694
00:52:20,579 --> 00:52:24,627
And if Goody tries to cheat again, I'll rip his head off myself!!

695
00:52:24,627 --> 00:52:26,859
- Are we going to fight or not?
- Fight!

696
00:52:26,859 --> 00:52:28,699
Kill them!!

697
00:52:28,699 --> 00:52:32,646
- Are we going to fight?
- Fight!

698
00:52:32,646 --> 00:52:34,286
That's enough!!

699
00:52:39,450 --> 00:52:41,653
This is weird. You?

700
00:52:41,653 --> 00:52:43,180
In all the years I've known you,

701
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:46,571
I've never seen you interested in watching office staff play sports.

702
00:52:46,571 --> 00:52:48,303
What's going on?

703
00:52:49,300 --> 00:52:52,619
I was free today, so I just came by to watch, that's all.

704
00:52:53,415 --> 00:52:55,790

- Kawee! Are you okay?

712
00:54:40,810 --> 00:54:44,100
Poor thing. It's okay now, all right?

713
00:55:00,776 --> 00:55:02,378
Perfect!!

714
00:55:09,409 --> 00:55:11,506
You said you were just watching.

715
00:55:11,506 --> 00:55:12,993
If you were actually here to cheer,

716
00:55:12,993 --> 00:55:16,493
wouldn't you be screaming like a fangirl by now?

717
00:55:21,340 --> 00:55:23,280
Get it over!

718
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:37,419
Who's that?

719
00:55:37,419 --> 00:55:39,092
Which department?

720
00:55:39,092 --> 00:55:40,395
Who?

721
00:55:40,395 --> 00:55:43,786
The one wearing a leather jacket playing volleyball. Which department?

722
00:55:44,670 --> 00:55:48,030
That's Kawee! He's a merchandiser from our office.

723
00:55:48,030 --> 00:55:51,219
You've had meetings with him. Don't you remember?

724
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:59,496
Look at this! Kawee and Secretary Prim are having a highlight moment!

725
00:55:59,496 --> 00:56:01,764
They've got some highlight moments going on!

726
00:56:01,764 --> 00:56:04,775
They're hugging, too! There's major skinship happening!

727
00:56:04,775 --> 00:56:09,919
It's giving total love-on-the-court vibes, super spicy!

728
00:56:09,919 --> 00:56:11,729
Time out!!

729
00:56:13,820 --> 00:56:15,706
Sub me in!!

730
00:56:18,200 --> 00:56:20,014
Sub you in?!

731
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:24,218
Don't tell me you're about to…

732
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:10,251
What are you staring at? This is all I've got to wear, okay?

733
00:57:10,251 --> 00:57:14,359
This outfit's for playing color games with the kids at home!

734
00:57:18,790 --> 00:57:20,905
I'll be on Goody's team.

735
00:57:20,905 --> 00:57:23,698
Director, you go on the other side.

736
00:57:23,698 --> 00:57:25,379
Okay, sir.

737
00:57:31,720 --> 00:57:33,775
Everyone on this court today is an athlete.

738
00:57:33,775 --> 00:57:36,936
Today, we're all equals. No bosses, no subordinates.

739
00:57:36,936 --> 00:57:38,411
Let's all give it our best.

740
00:57:38,411 --> 00:57:42,238
No need to go easy on me. Let's have fun!

741
00:57:50,004 --> 00:57:51,900
So much fun!

742
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:55,025
- Fun! This is awesome!
- Fun! This is awesome!

743
00:58:19,464 --> 00:58:22,130
You were amazing!

744
00:58:31,718 --> 00:58:34,785
Oh no, Kawee! Are you okay? Does it hurt?

745
00:58:34,785 --> 00:58:37,371
Isn't that a bit too much?

746
00:58:37,371 --> 00:58:40,115
Oh no. Go over there. That way, that way!

747
00:58:47,310 --> 00:58:51,273
Someone said that on the court, everyone's equal, right?

748
00:59:02,474 --> 00:59:04,177
Boss!

749
00:59:07,270 --> 00:59:10,693
Sir, are you all right?

750
00:59:10,693 --> 00:59:12,127
I'm fine.

751
00:59:12,127 --> 00:59:13,804
Are you sure? Is it bad?

752
00:59:13,804 --> 00:59:15,520
Doesn't hurt at all…

753
00:59:17,430 --> 00:59:19,658
Let's go to the infirmary.

754
00:59:19,658 --> 00:59:22,080
It's not that serious.

755
00:59:22,080 --> 00:59:24,275
Well, to me, anything about you is serious.

756
00:59:24,275 --> 00:59:26,340
Yong, please take him to the infirmary.

757
00:59:26,340 --> 00:59:29,660
- Be careful, Yong!
- Be careful, Yong!

758
00:59:42,810 --> 00:59:44,814
What are you doing?

759
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:49,166
The nurse said you need to ice it regularly.

760
00:59:49,166 --> 00:59:51,838
- But…
- No buts.

761
00:59:53,310 --> 00:59:55,582
Then… excuse me.

762
01:00:03,590 --> 01:00:05,563
You don't need to take it off.

763
01:00:05,563 --> 01:00:08,136
And how am I supposed to ice it without taking it off?

764
01:00:08,136 --> 01:00:11,329
- It's really not necessary.
- Don't be stubborn, sir.

765
01:00:22,620 --> 01:00:24,619
Aren't you icing it?

766
01:00:27,170 --> 01:00:28,673
Right.

767
01:00:39,990 --> 01:00:43,047
For the first couple of days, use cold compresses.

768
01:00:43,047 --> 01:00:46,600
If it's still sore, then switch to warm ones.

769
01:00:47,830 --> 01:00:50,343
Thanks for worrying about me.

770
01:00:51,560 --> 01:00:53,900
I'm just doing my job.

771
01:00:57,000 --> 01:00:58,606
Is that so?

772
01:01:01,746 --> 01:01:03,858
You had fun out there, didn't you?

773
01:01:04,570 --> 01:01:05,512
What?

774
01:01:05,512 --> 01:01:08,253
The volleyball game. You had fun.

775
01:01:08,900 --> 01:01:10,455
It was more stressful than fun.

776
01:01:10,455 --> 01:01:14,627
Bhum was playing like her life depended on it. She really wanted to win.

777
01:01:14,627 --> 01:01:16,101
I doubt that.

778
01:01:16,101 --> 01:01:18,781
You looked pretty chummy with Kawee.

779
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,151
Well, we scored a point. Of course, my friends and I were happy.

780
01:01:23,151 --> 01:01:24,879
You want me to frown instead?

781
01:01:24,879 --> 01:01:27,572
Be happy, sure. But did you have to cling to him like that?

782
01:01:27,572 --> 01:01:29,016
Aren't you afraid of inappropriate touching?

783
01:01:29,016 --> 01:01:33,190
Inappropriate touch? Kawee's not that kind of person.

784
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:37,140
Really? You know him that well? Why don't you just date him already?

785
01:01:37,140 --> 01:01:38,960
Well, sounds like an interesting idea.

786
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,932
Secretary Prim, don't be sarcastic with me.

787
01:01:41,932 --> 01:01:44,951
I'm not being sarcastic. You brought it up first.

788
01:01:44,951 --> 01:01:47,439
Come to think of it, Kawee's really attractive.

789
01:01:47,439 --> 01:01:52,723
The girls all adore him. If I married him, I wouldn't be ashamed at all.

790
01:02:02,800 --> 01:02:04,308
No!

791
01:02:04,308 --> 01:02:08,472
It has to be to me if you're going to get married. And only me.
