1
00:01:05,288 --> 00:01:10,424
I saw Yong following a woman into a van
the other day.

2
00:01:10,424 --> 00:01:11,993
It must be "Pen, dear" for sure!

3
00:01:11,993 --> 00:01:14,021
"Pen, dear" is here.

4
00:01:14,021 --> 00:01:16,389
My grandma is old and doesn't have much to do,
so she sells steamed sticky rice here.

5
00:01:16,389 --> 00:01:18,589
Mind knows about us now.

6
00:01:19,132 --> 00:01:21,226
- Really?
- And don't worry, Prim.

7
00:01:21,226 --> 00:01:24,380
My lips are sealed.

8
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:26,729
Yes! Someone finally knows.

9
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:29,265
I'll give you some time to end things with her.

10
00:01:29,265 --> 00:01:31,974
Anyway, that woman is not right for you.

11
00:01:31,974 --> 00:01:33,502
If you don't believe me,

12
00:01:33,502 --> 00:01:36,379
I'll let the second line
take over the business.

13
00:01:36,379 --> 00:01:38,961
If I die, how would you feel?

14
00:01:38,961 --> 00:01:40,388
Why are you saying this?

15
00:01:40,388 --> 00:01:43,864
I just wanted to express that
anything can happen.

16
00:01:50,057 --> 00:01:51,057
Dad…

17
00:02:05,910 --> 00:02:07,297
Who died?

18
00:02:07,297 --> 00:02:09,076
Dad's dead.

19
00:02:13,023 --> 00:02:14,523
Look, I'm right here.

20
00:02:15,183 --> 00:02:16,807
Then who's that on the bed?

21
00:02:20,624 --> 00:02:21,724
Boss!

22
00:02:26,523 --> 00:02:27,623
Boss!

23
00:02:32,186 --> 00:02:33,604
Bad dream, huh?

24
00:02:33,604 --> 00:02:36,801
But why were you yelling your boss's name?

25
00:02:37,628 --> 00:02:39,532
I had a really weird dream, Dad.

26
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:44,237
I was relieved when I woke up
and found you here.

27
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,458
This is really me! Try touching, see?

28
00:02:52,638 --> 00:02:55,118
Did your boss upgrade the room to this extent?

29
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:57,420
Of course.

30
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,627
I just found out that
the boss holds shares in this hospital too.

31
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:03,442
You've become a VIP guest, you know?

32
00:03:03,442 --> 00:03:04,442
Absolutely.

33
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,917
A top specialist will take care of you.

34
00:03:07,632 --> 00:03:12,215
Look, no specialist can compete
with my daughter, the doctor!

35
00:03:13,290 --> 00:03:15,512
Pround, hurry and finish your studies, okay?

36
00:03:16,092 --> 00:03:20,057
Next time I get sick,
you'll be the only one taking care of me.

37
00:03:20,717 --> 00:03:22,506
But I won't be treating only you, Dad.

38
00:03:22,506 --> 00:03:23,667
Huh? Why not?

39
00:03:23,667 --> 00:03:24,726
I'll be broke, that's why.

40
00:03:26,548 --> 00:03:27,548
That's true!

41
00:03:28,108 --> 00:03:30,765
By the way, are you going home to change?

42
00:03:30,765 --> 00:03:32,673
We'll come along too. We need to talk.

43
00:03:34,061 --> 00:03:35,145
What about Dad?

44
00:03:35,145 --> 00:03:37,426
Come on, he's not dying anytime soon.

45
00:03:37,426 --> 00:03:39,526
Just rest here.
Someone will come to check on VIP anyway.

46
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:40,779
Look, look!

47
00:03:41,453 --> 00:03:43,036
Dad, you're sure you're okay?

48
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:44,985
Of course! I'm totally fine.

49
00:03:44,985 --> 00:03:47,585
Hey, you guys rarely meet up,

50
00:03:47,585 --> 00:03:49,712
so go have a nice meal and chat together.

51
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,211
I'll just stay here and flirt with the nurses.

52
00:03:52,211 --> 00:03:53,411
Dad!

53
00:04:08,942 --> 00:04:11,755
Wow, is this a grand opening or something?

54
00:04:11,755 --> 00:04:16,002
Walking in together like this,
are you two a couple now?

55
00:04:17,015 --> 00:04:18,570
Nope but…

56
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:21,973
Today is Pink Day.

57
00:04:21,973 --> 00:04:26,203
We want everyone to wear pink,

58
00:04:26,203 --> 00:04:30,904
no matter their gender or age,
to make the world brighter.

59
00:04:31,738 --> 00:04:35,473
And also, today is Anti-Bullying Day.

60
00:04:35,473 --> 00:04:37,579
- Oops!
- You can't say bad things.

61
00:04:37,579 --> 00:04:39,059
Right, my lovely Bhum?

62
00:04:39,059 --> 00:04:41,728
Exactly, my fierce Goody?

63
00:04:41,728 --> 00:04:43,124
- Wow!
- Wow?

64
00:04:43,124 --> 00:04:45,106
Today, you're so thin.

65
00:04:45,106 --> 00:04:47,387
- Oh yeah.
- You look so slim.

66
00:04:47,387 --> 00:04:51,384
So skinny, I thought you were Antonia Porsild!

67
00:04:51,384 --> 00:04:52,930
Thailand, dear!

68
00:04:55,502 --> 00:04:57,903
- Oops! Your nose!
- What?

69
00:04:57,903 --> 00:05:00,112
Your nose looks amazing today!

70
00:05:00,112 --> 00:05:02,835
- Really beautiful!
- Really? Beautiful!

71
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:04,997
- Totally on point!
- Fake…

72
00:05:04,997 --> 00:05:06,538
It's Fake Day today!

73
00:05:07,613 --> 00:05:09,057
Don't forget to check the projector, TV,

74
00:05:09,057 --> 00:05:11,384
and all the connection cables
to ensure they're ready to use.

75
00:05:11,384 --> 00:05:12,658
As for the drinks and snacks,

76
00:05:12,658 --> 00:05:14,946
make sure they match the list exactly,
no mistakes allowed!

77
00:05:14,946 --> 00:05:16,210
Oh, and most importantly,

78
00:05:16,210 --> 00:05:19,090
there mustn't be
a single cable tie in the room. Got it?

79
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,237
- Hey.
- What?

80
00:05:20,237 --> 00:05:22,705
Did Mind take the wrong meds today
or something?

81
00:05:22,705 --> 00:05:26,375
Why does she suddenly look
so determined and overly hardworking?

82
00:05:27,542 --> 00:05:29,173
Of course she's determined.

83
00:05:29,173 --> 00:05:30,673
Prim took leave to take care of her dad,

84
00:05:30,673 --> 00:05:33,118
so she had to take on
the role of the secretary instead.

85
00:05:33,931 --> 00:05:35,888
Why don't you know, you fool!

86
00:05:36,715 --> 00:05:39,337
Yeah, smart ass!

87
00:05:39,337 --> 00:05:40,997
- You crooked nose!
- Hey!

88
00:05:40,997 --> 00:05:42,510
Didn't you just say my nose was pretty?

89
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:45,177
You liar! You evil witch!

90
00:05:45,177 --> 00:05:46,637
If I'm a witch, then you're a ghost!

91
00:05:46,637 --> 00:05:47,716
If I'm a ghost, then you're a ghoul!

92
00:05:47,716 --> 00:05:49,092
- Hey!
- You ghoul!

93
00:05:50,292 --> 00:05:51,492
I don't like you.

94
00:05:57,711 --> 00:05:59,132
I miss my girlfriend.

95
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,524
Hi, my friend.

96
00:06:07,612 --> 00:06:09,278
What's wrong with you?

97
00:06:09,278 --> 00:06:11,779
Just because
Prim didn't come to work for a day,

98
00:06:11,779 --> 00:06:14,119
you're sulking like a sad puppy?

99
00:06:15,667 --> 00:06:16,667
Shoe?

100
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,164
Why? Is there something stuck on my shoe?

101
00:06:23,319 --> 00:06:26,009
Oh, Mr. Moody!

102
00:06:26,516 --> 00:06:28,217
Prim hasn't replied to my messages at all.

103
00:06:28,217 --> 00:06:30,213
Doesn't she realize I'm worried about her?

104
00:06:30,213 --> 00:06:31,327
So heartless.

105
00:06:31,327 --> 00:06:34,833
Oh, rookie lover!

106
00:06:34,833 --> 00:06:38,532
Prim has her own things going on in life.
Maybe she's just focusing on her dad right now.

107
00:06:38,532 --> 00:06:40,393
She should let me be involved too!

108
00:06:40,393 --> 00:06:41,613
Oh?

109
00:06:41,613 --> 00:06:43,322
I'm worried about her dad too.

110
00:06:43,322 --> 00:06:45,210
Her dad is like my own dad

111
00:06:46,058 --> 00:06:48,185
I can't take this anymore. I'm calling her.

112
00:06:48,185 --> 00:06:50,287
Stop! Hold up! Calm down.

113
00:06:52,070 --> 00:06:54,126
Okay, fine! No calling.
I'll go see her instead.

114
00:06:54,126 --> 00:06:56,384
Oh gosh, you're so impulsive!

115
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:00,141
Uh-huh. Right, this isn't good.

116
00:07:00,141 --> 00:07:02,419
Prim might be stressed about her dad,

117
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:04,160
- and that's personal.
- Yeah…

118
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,865
No matter how much
I miss her or worry about her,

119
00:07:05,865 --> 00:07:07,979
I shouldn't interfere.

120
00:07:07,979 --> 00:07:10,547
- Couples should respect each other's privacy.
- Yes.

121
00:07:10,547 --> 00:07:11,976
So we won't feel suffocated.

122
00:07:11,976 --> 00:07:14,310
- That's right?
- Absolutely right.

123
00:07:15,037 --> 00:07:16,465
Thinking like this feels better.

124
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:17,565
I better go to the meeting.

125
00:07:21,744 --> 00:07:23,915
You can actually
figure it all out yourself, huh?

126
00:07:23,915 --> 00:07:26,085
[Thai rice noodles]

127
00:07:26,764 --> 00:07:29,052
So, did you have something to talk to me?

128
00:07:31,486 --> 00:07:32,486
Ready?

129
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:46,897
Two hundred thousand?

130
00:07:46,897 --> 00:07:48,738
Why did you transfer this? What for?

131
00:07:49,471 --> 00:07:52,309
Well, I started a personal shopping service
for imported goods.

132
00:07:52,309 --> 00:07:55,613
It made great money,
so I gave you a bit of the profit to spend.

133
00:07:55,613 --> 00:07:57,448
Hey, I can't accept this!

134
00:07:57,448 --> 00:08:00,106
You should save it for Ploen's tuition instead.

135
00:08:00,792 --> 00:08:02,621
If Prim doesn't want it, I'll take it!

136
00:08:04,211 --> 00:08:05,853
Come on, just take it.

137
00:08:05,853 --> 00:08:10,654
You've been taking care of me,
Pround, Dad, and even little Ploen.

138
00:08:10,654 --> 00:08:12,316
You've done so much.

139
00:08:12,316 --> 00:08:14,068
You deserve this money.

140
00:08:14,068 --> 00:08:16,066
It's not even half of what you've given us.

141
00:08:16,739 --> 00:08:19,449
Keep it as a spear
while you're quitting the job,

142
00:08:19,449 --> 00:08:20,543
and searching for a new job.

143
00:08:20,543 --> 00:08:23,643
Or use this money to pursue your dream,
something you've always wanted to do.

144
00:08:23,643 --> 00:08:24,643
Just take it.

145
00:08:28,029 --> 00:08:31,340
Just take it, Prim. You deserve it.

146
00:08:34,241 --> 00:08:35,241
Alright…

147
00:08:35,895 --> 00:08:37,495
but can you make it two million instead?

148
00:08:38,772 --> 00:08:40,207
What?

149
00:08:41,269 --> 00:08:43,275
Pear! What about me?

150
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:47,120
I'll give it to you, don't worry. Oh, well.

151
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:48,509
- Is it a lot, huh?
- Wait a sec.

152
00:08:49,196 --> 00:08:50,269
Just give it to me now.

153
00:08:50,269 --> 00:08:52,899
Here, take this first.

154
00:08:53,826 --> 00:08:55,041
Smooth move, huh?

155
00:08:56,707 --> 00:08:57,707
Teacher Jaem?

156
00:08:59,385 --> 00:09:00,938
Hello, Teacher Jaem.

157
00:09:03,041 --> 00:09:05,976
Okay. I'll be there right away, right.

158
00:09:07,937 --> 00:09:11,558
The teacher called and told me
Ploen got bullied by friends.

159
00:09:11,558 --> 00:09:12,558
What?

160
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:17,847
- Ploen!
- Hey.

161
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:19,756
What happened, sweetie?

162
00:09:19,756 --> 00:09:21,400
Who did this to you?

163
00:09:25,251 --> 00:09:27,911
Ploen, can you tell me what happened?

164
00:09:29,388 --> 00:09:31,110
Ploen, tell me, sweetie.

165
00:09:31,110 --> 00:09:32,981
Who did this to you? I won't scold you.

166
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:36,704
Messi mocked me, saying I don't have a dad.

167
00:09:41,942 --> 00:09:44,968
Messi also said I look ugly.

168
00:09:46,845 --> 00:09:48,845
And have to play as the servant.

169
00:09:49,438 --> 00:09:52,282
He also threw sand at my face.

170
00:09:52,282 --> 00:09:53,876
It got into my eyes.

171
00:09:53,876 --> 00:09:54,876
What?

172
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:57,593
Come on, let's go see Teacher Jaem.

173
00:09:59,527 --> 00:10:00,588
Messi, right?

174
00:10:02,552 --> 00:10:04,499
What's going on here, Teacher Jaem?

175
00:10:04,499 --> 00:10:06,764
- Oh, well.
- Yeah, what's happened here?

176
00:10:06,764 --> 00:10:10,556
Is this how you raise your kid?
Mocking my niece and even bullying her?

177
00:10:12,184 --> 00:10:14,097
Kids are just playing around like kids do.

178
00:10:14,097 --> 00:10:16,885
It's just that. Don't overthink it.

179
00:10:16,885 --> 00:10:18,367
Overthinking, ma'am?

180
00:10:18,927 --> 00:10:20,791
They were just playing, weren't they?

181
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:22,859
Why do adults always
make such a big deal, bitch?

182
00:10:24,601 --> 00:10:28,111
Who are you calling a bitch, ma'am?
Just playing, huh?

183
00:10:35,544 --> 00:10:36,553
Stop it!

184
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:38,145
- Here, are you having fun, huh?
- What are you doing?

185
00:10:38,145 --> 00:10:39,852
Don't do that! She'll get hurt!

186
00:10:39,852 --> 00:10:41,679
Don't stop me, we're just playing!

187
00:10:41,679 --> 00:10:43,647
Let go of me! Let go!

188
00:10:45,066 --> 00:10:46,225
Not having fun?

189
00:10:46,225 --> 00:10:47,951
Come play with me some more!

190
00:10:47,951 --> 00:10:49,314
It's so much fun!

191
00:10:51,258 --> 00:10:52,757
Oh, my goodness.

192
00:10:52,757 --> 00:10:53,857
Are you hurt?

193
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:57,145
Fortunately, it's just a scratch.
It'll heal soon.

194
00:10:59,295 --> 00:11:01,721
I'm still mad just thinking about
that mother and son.

195
00:11:03,898 --> 00:11:06,035
Why didn't you stand up
for yourself today, Ploen?

196
00:11:06,035 --> 00:11:08,810
Normally, my niece is a real fighter.

197
00:11:09,530 --> 00:11:12,516
Because on Children's Day,
I got a little too rough

198
00:11:12,516 --> 00:11:15,088
and Mommy said I was a bad kid.

199
00:11:15,088 --> 00:11:17,992
I don't want to be a bad kid.

200
00:11:17,992 --> 00:11:19,930
Oh sweetie.

201
00:11:19,930 --> 00:11:21,918
So you didn't fight back today

202
00:11:21,918 --> 00:11:23,655
because you were afraid of being a bad kid?

203
00:11:24,305 --> 00:11:25,305
Yes.

204
00:11:25,874 --> 00:11:27,467
Ploen, sweetie.

205
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,748
Standing up for yourself
and bullying others are not the same.

206
00:11:31,408 --> 00:11:33,543
If you bully others, that's wrong.

207
00:11:34,538 --> 00:11:38,237
But if you're being bullied,
you have every right to defend yourself.

208
00:11:38,237 --> 00:11:40,685
You must protect yourself, okay, sweetie?

209
00:11:40,685 --> 00:11:42,160
Understood.

210
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,297
Yes, we should also use our strength

211
00:11:45,297 --> 00:11:48,058
to protect those who are being bullied, okay?

212
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:54,318
Just talking about it still makes me mad
at that mother and son.

213
00:11:54,318 --> 00:11:56,025
Should I go on? Fight a bit more?

214
00:11:56,025 --> 00:11:57,225
- Oh!
- Calm down, Mommy.

215
00:11:57,225 --> 00:11:59,204
Sit down. Enough already.

216
00:11:59,204 --> 00:12:00,417
It's so frustrating!

217
00:12:05,333 --> 00:12:06,588
Wait a second. Hold on…

218
00:12:09,245 --> 00:12:10,678
Yes, sir.

219
00:12:10,678 --> 00:12:11,805
Where are you?

220
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:14,555
I'm on my way to see your father.
I'm at the hospital now.

221
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:17,174
You're at the hospital, Boss?

222
00:12:17,174 --> 00:12:19,509
Right now, I'm at Ploen's school.

223
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:21,542
Hold on, sir. I'll be there soon.

224
00:12:22,555 --> 00:12:23,555
What happened?

225
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:26,376
Boss is going to visit
our father at the hospital.

226
00:12:26,376 --> 00:12:27,376
Huh?

227
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,660
Here we go!

228
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:33,334
The future father-in-law rocker
and the dramatic future son-in-law.

229
00:12:33,334 --> 00:12:34,600
This is gonna be entertaining!

230
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:37,968
So entertaining,
his heart's going to act up again, huh?

231
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,272
I'm going to the hospital first!

232
00:12:40,272 --> 00:12:42,052
I'll go with you! I have to be on my shift.

233
00:12:42,052 --> 00:12:43,922
Yeah, yeah, let's go, go!

234
00:12:43,922 --> 00:12:45,867
Hey! Give me back my child!

235
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:47,289
Oh, I forgot.

236
00:12:47,289 --> 00:12:48,519
Go back, go, go!

237
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:51,025
- You're just going with them, huh?
- We're going!

238
00:12:51,025 --> 00:12:52,080
See you later, goodbye!

239
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:53,964
- Oh, I'll follow.
- Yeah.

240
00:12:55,774 --> 00:12:58,009
Let's go home then, girl.

241
00:13:01,845 --> 00:13:03,077
I have to go to my ward.

242
00:13:03,077 --> 00:13:05,273
Say hello to my future brother-in-law for me.

243
00:13:05,852 --> 00:13:06,852
Okay.

244
00:13:13,074 --> 00:13:14,274
Boss.

245
00:13:14,927 --> 00:13:16,311
Have you been waiting long?

246
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:17,311
Not so long.

247
00:13:18,021 --> 00:13:19,805
How is your father doing?

248
00:13:19,805 --> 00:13:21,896
I've made sure the doctors at the hospital

249
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:24,235
will take good care of him as much as they can.

250
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:25,942
Thank you.

251
00:13:26,468 --> 00:13:27,802
My father is doing better now.

252
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:30,324
He should be able to go home in a few days.

253
00:13:31,077 --> 00:13:32,859
Well, that must be a relief for you.

254
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:34,212
You don't have to worry anymore.

255
00:13:36,177 --> 00:13:38,742
Now, let's go visit my father-in-law. Let's go.

256
00:13:38,742 --> 00:13:40,255
Wait a moment.

257
00:13:42,195 --> 00:13:45,957
I think it would be better
if you didn't meet my father just yet.

258
00:13:47,106 --> 00:13:48,106
Why?

259
00:13:48,106 --> 00:13:50,095
I'm worried that my father might be shocked.

260
00:13:50,095 --> 00:13:51,095
Well…

261
00:13:51,721 --> 00:13:56,326
I think it's still a bit too soon for you
to meet him as my boyfriend.

262
00:13:58,303 --> 00:13:59,783
Boyfriend…

263
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:01,158
I like the sound of that.

264
00:14:01,911 --> 00:14:03,544
But why would your father be shocked?

265
00:14:06,474 --> 00:14:08,984
Let me take this gift basket instead.

266
00:14:09,691 --> 00:14:11,006
Wait a minute.

267
00:14:11,006 --> 00:14:13,513
Why do you seem like
you don't want me to meet your father?

268
00:14:13,513 --> 00:14:15,162
Does your father not like me?

269
00:14:17,563 --> 00:14:19,163
Or maybe you don't want to introduce me?

270
00:14:19,863 --> 00:14:21,364
Or you don't really want to date me?

271
00:14:21,364 --> 00:14:22,740
You don't truly love me and want to marry me?

272
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:24,634
- Are you deceiving me, Secretary--
- Hey, wait a sec.

273
00:14:24,634 --> 00:14:26,204
It's not like that at all.

274
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:27,721
Then what is it?

275
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,086
Okay, I'll leave then.

276
00:14:34,819 --> 00:14:36,363
Wait, Boss!

277
00:14:37,196 --> 00:14:39,887
Don't get mad, my love, please.

278
00:14:39,887 --> 00:14:40,887
Please.

279
00:14:42,801 --> 00:14:44,407
Since the day I was born,

280
00:14:44,407 --> 00:14:46,603
aside from the doctor
who was slow in delivering me,

281
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:49,223
And it took me a little too long
to brilliance in this world,

282
00:14:49,837 --> 00:14:51,214
I've never been upset with anyone,

283
00:14:53,507 --> 00:14:54,764
except for you.

284
00:15:24,013 --> 00:15:25,013
Dad! Oh no!

285
00:15:26,685 --> 00:15:29,645
Oh, I'm… I'm sorry.

286
00:15:34,239 --> 00:15:35,412
Hello, Father.

287
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:40,106
Tim, take me back to the room.

288
00:15:40,875 --> 00:15:43,186
Excuse me, my name is Joy.

289
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:44,186
Oh, sorry.

290
00:15:50,473 --> 00:15:51,673
Nice to meet you again.

291
00:15:53,542 --> 00:15:55,488
Yes, Father, hello again.

292
00:15:56,081 --> 00:15:58,290
Look, you're this grown up

293
00:15:58,796 --> 00:16:00,898
and still can't tie a necktie?

294
00:16:02,272 --> 00:16:04,986
You followed her to the hospital
just to make her work?

295
00:16:06,691 --> 00:16:08,605
Well, that's not it.

296
00:16:08,605 --> 00:16:10,060
I'm here to visit you, Father.

297
00:16:13,012 --> 00:16:14,612
What about the other staff members?

298
00:16:15,538 --> 00:16:18,644
Do you treat them the same way, equally?

299
00:16:22,131 --> 00:16:25,406
If the opportunity arises,
the boss treats all the staff equally.

300
00:16:25,406 --> 00:16:27,186
I see… well,

301
00:16:28,225 --> 00:16:30,897
I must thank you for coming to visit

302
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:32,639
and for taking good care of my room.

303
00:16:33,413 --> 00:16:34,528
It's my pleasure.

304
00:16:34,528 --> 00:16:37,202
But honestly, there's no need for you
to be so formal with me.

305
00:16:37,202 --> 00:16:39,937
I can't help it. You're my daughter's boss.

306
00:16:39,937 --> 00:16:41,037
I wouldn't dare.

307
00:16:41,597 --> 00:16:43,578
Oh, no need, Father.
I feel it's out of your way.

308
00:16:43,578 --> 00:16:45,196
It's okay, I feel considerate of you.

309
00:16:45,196 --> 00:16:47,399
- But I feel even more considerate.
- I feel even more considerate of you, man.

310
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:49,745
- But I also feel--
- I said I wouldn't dare!

311
00:16:49,745 --> 00:16:52,436
Dad, please lower your voice a bit.

312
00:17:03,193 --> 00:17:04,683
What are you doing, sir?

313
00:17:06,838 --> 00:17:10,591
Father, I'd like to let you know that
Prim and I are together now.

314
00:17:11,244 --> 00:17:15,860
I would like to ask you, Father,
to officially date your daughter.

315
00:17:15,860 --> 00:17:17,969
I ask for permission to take care of Prim.

316
00:17:17,969 --> 00:17:18,969
No need.

317
00:17:21,296 --> 00:17:23,334
Prim can take care of herself just fine.

318
00:17:23,334 --> 00:17:25,758
Besides, she has a father,

319
00:17:25,758 --> 00:17:29,434
older sister and young sister
to look out for her.

320
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,687
No one else is needed.

321
00:17:32,895 --> 00:17:35,666
But Prim and I really love each other, Father.

322
00:17:36,894 --> 00:17:38,641
"Father" this, "Father" that, huh?

323
00:17:39,931 --> 00:17:42,588
Who exactly are you calling for?
Who's your father, huh?

324
00:17:43,496 --> 00:17:45,331
- Well, I guess I'll call you Uncle.
- Too old.

325
00:17:45,331 --> 00:17:46,813
Then Mr. Poj, is that alright?

326
00:17:46,813 --> 00:17:48,895
Look, call me whatever you want,

327
00:17:49,815 --> 00:17:51,135
but I won't beat around the bush.

328
00:17:51,845 --> 00:17:53,205
I want to make it clear.

329
00:17:54,502 --> 00:17:57,006
That I disapprove of this relationship.

330
00:17:58,738 --> 00:18:01,423
Leave, I don't want to hear it.

331
00:18:01,423 --> 00:18:03,400
But I really love Prim, Father.

332
00:18:08,296 --> 00:18:09,729
I really do love her.

333
00:18:13,159 --> 00:18:14,799
Oh, my chest is hurt!

334
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:16,077
- I can't breathe!
- Dad!

335
00:18:16,077 --> 00:18:17,814
- It hurts!
- Father!

336
00:18:17,814 --> 00:18:19,913
It's really painful!

337
00:18:19,913 --> 00:18:21,898
Dad, well.

338
00:18:21,898 --> 00:18:23,199
- Boss.
- But…

339
00:18:23,199 --> 00:18:24,788
- It hurts! My heart hurts!
- Step outside for a moment.

340
00:18:24,788 --> 00:18:26,460
- Come back later, okay?
- My heart hurts!

341
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:36,167
Dad!

342
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:39,920
Why did you have to tease him like that?

343
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,508
I just wanted to mess with him.
I don't like him.

344
00:18:43,601 --> 00:18:45,423
But why don't you like him?

345
00:18:45,929 --> 00:18:47,819
He's a good person, you know?

346
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:50,664
No reason. What's the problem?

347
00:18:50,664 --> 00:18:52,506
I'm sick and need plenty of rest.

348
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:53,741
Don't bother me.

349
00:18:53,741 --> 00:18:54,746
Go away!

350
00:18:57,817 --> 00:18:58,917
Oh, Dad!

351
00:19:08,102 --> 00:19:09,195
Hey?

352
00:19:09,195 --> 00:19:10,208
Hey.

353
00:19:10,208 --> 00:19:11,223
What are you doing here?

354
00:19:12,143 --> 00:19:13,611
I came to visit Prim's father.

355
00:19:14,211 --> 00:19:15,298
Is Prim's father sick?

356
00:19:15,298 --> 00:19:17,277
Yeah. But he's okay now.

357
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:20,426
Oh, you're trying to score some points, huh?

358
00:19:23,131 --> 00:19:24,744
Then what are you doing at the hospital?

359
00:19:25,384 --> 00:19:26,384
Are you sick?

360
00:19:26,892 --> 00:19:29,014
I'm here for an appointment
with the psychiatrist.

361
00:19:29,014 --> 00:19:30,416
This will be my last visit, though.

362
00:19:31,029 --> 00:19:33,897
The confusion in my head
is completely gone now.

363
00:19:36,274 --> 00:19:39,189
I'm happy for you
and glad you finally unlocked that.

364
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,866
Thanks a lot.

365
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:44,227
Oh, and congratulations to you and Prim too.

366
00:19:44,778 --> 00:19:46,478
By the way, does Mom know about this?

367
00:19:47,372 --> 00:19:48,372
Not yet.

368
00:19:49,641 --> 00:19:51,461
Alright, I'll take care of that.

369
00:19:51,461 --> 00:19:53,769
When she knows, she'll definitely be so happy.

370
00:19:55,692 --> 00:19:56,692
I have to go.

371
00:19:57,764 --> 00:19:58,864
See you around.

372
00:20:06,182 --> 00:20:08,629
Don't worry too much about my dad, sir.

373
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:10,478
I think he just wasn't prepared for it.

374
00:20:10,478 --> 00:20:13,100
All of a sudden, boss became boyfriend.

375
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:15,560
He was probably
just shocked and acted that way.

376
00:20:16,890 --> 00:20:19,545
I understand, but I'm not backing down.

377
00:20:19,545 --> 00:20:23,075
I'm an expert at overcoming obstacles,

378
00:20:23,075 --> 00:20:24,930
I won't give up this easily!

379
00:20:25,444 --> 00:20:28,454
Yeah, Prim is always on your team.

380
00:20:29,055 --> 00:20:30,155
Good luck, sir!

381
00:20:31,525 --> 00:20:34,244
By the way, how should I handle this situation?

382
00:21:04,172 --> 00:21:05,172
What's wrong?

383
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,738
Is it true that Thee and Prim are dating?

384
00:21:15,633 --> 00:21:16,633
Yeah, Mom.

385
00:21:17,264 --> 00:21:21,360
That's great! Thee will finally
have someone good to take care of him.

386
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,535
I'm so happy for them!

387
00:21:24,548 --> 00:21:26,861
Why is this something to be happy about?

388
00:21:27,377 --> 00:21:31,095
Look, this isn't something
we should be happy about.

389
00:21:31,095 --> 00:21:35,649
We should be making those two break up instead.

390
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:39,774
Otherwise, Grandpa's going to
have a problem with us.

391
00:21:40,612 --> 00:21:45,404
Your father's planning to hand
the business over to the second line, right?

392
00:21:47,445 --> 00:21:51,100
That's a good idea.
You and the kids won't have to work so hard.

393
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:54,154
You can just relax and enjoy the dividends.

394
00:21:54,154 --> 00:21:57,067
Well, you sound just like Thee.

395
00:21:57,067 --> 00:22:00,391
But seriously, aren't you worried at all?

396
00:22:02,410 --> 00:22:04,170
What should I be worried about?

397
00:22:04,170 --> 00:22:07,224
Right now, our kid is happy.

398
00:22:07,897 --> 00:22:10,254
If you're so concerned about the business,

399
00:22:10,254 --> 00:22:13,592
you can go back to running it yourself.

400
00:22:13,592 --> 00:22:16,347
Thee's working hard

401
00:22:16,347 --> 00:22:20,854
while you play golf all day and
living the good life for a while.

402
00:22:20,854 --> 00:22:23,424
Well, I'm old now.

403
00:22:24,817 --> 00:22:28,669
So you're saying that I'm old too?

404
00:22:28,669 --> 00:22:30,049
When did I say you're old?

405
00:22:30,049 --> 00:22:32,627
Well, look, your eyes say it all.

406
00:22:32,627 --> 00:22:35,812
Alright, calm down, Dad and Mom, don't argue.

407
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:39,433
I don't want to argue either.

408
00:22:40,734 --> 00:22:42,898
I don't want to argue either.

409
00:22:48,561 --> 00:22:50,514
I'm so tired of all the rules,

410
00:22:50,514 --> 00:22:54,711
the big house regulations, and business stuff.

411
00:22:55,410 --> 00:22:59,272
What we have now is enough.

412
00:22:59,272 --> 00:23:02,233
If anyone wants something, they can take it.

413
00:23:02,939 --> 00:23:05,105
I don't think Dad is worried about money.

414
00:23:05,612 --> 00:23:06,741
I think he's worried…

415
00:23:06,741 --> 00:23:09,613
That the business,
which has been built for generations,

416
00:23:09,613 --> 00:23:10,921
might collapse.

417
00:23:12,752 --> 00:23:17,095
And don't you worry that grandpa might
actually fire Thee from his position?

418
00:23:18,394 --> 00:23:23,889
I am worried, but I'm angrier that
Dad doesn't know how to fight for his kids.

419
00:23:26,132 --> 00:23:28,078
Hey, Tham…

420
00:23:28,078 --> 00:23:33,683
As a mother, my children's happiness is
the most important thing.

421
00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:40,669
How is it, Dad? Is the atmosphere nice?

422
00:23:40,669 --> 00:23:44,243
Oh, the air is great,
and the food here is good too.

423
00:23:45,122 --> 00:23:46,682
They always give back to the customers.

424
00:23:48,976 --> 00:23:49,976
So relaxing.

425
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:55,765
See? I didn't even finish saying it,

426
00:23:55,765 --> 00:23:57,602
and now there's rock music
for the patients to listen to.

427
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:58,702
Pretty cool!

428
00:24:08,072 --> 00:24:09,171
That…

429
00:24:09,171 --> 00:24:10,819
That's your boss?

430
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:12,779
Hello, everyone!

431
00:24:13,587 --> 00:24:16,302
We are Big Bang Andromeda Supernova Sonic!

432
00:24:16,302 --> 00:24:18,492
We have the opportunity
to bring the fun to all of you.

433
00:24:18,492 --> 00:24:21,363
Let's all have a blast with the music today,

434
00:24:21,363 --> 00:24:23,834
and I hope everyone gets better soon!

435
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,610
Raise your hands!

436
00:24:25,610 --> 00:24:26,881
Yay!

437
00:24:26,881 --> 00:24:28,080
Make some noise!

438
00:24:29,073 --> 00:24:30,073
Louder!

439
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:32,617
Louder!

440
00:24:33,519 --> 00:24:34,619
One more time!

441
00:24:36,622 --> 00:24:38,062
He's so crazy, it really gets to me.

442
00:24:55,697 --> 00:24:57,069
Stop!

443
00:24:58,742 --> 00:25:01,213
You came here asking to performing a song.

444
00:25:01,213 --> 00:25:04,543
But you can't sing rock music like this!

445
00:25:05,325 --> 00:25:08,724
The seriously ill patients will be shocked!

446
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:13,191
Security guard, please escort him out!

447
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:14,840
- Hey, wait a second, bro!
- Please leave.

448
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,242
- Please leave.
- I just got on stage, calm down!

449
00:25:16,242 --> 00:25:18,743
- Stop it!
- I'm not done yet!

450
00:25:18,743 --> 00:25:20,885
- Please leave.
- Please don't, please.

451
00:25:26,574 --> 00:25:29,060
What rock? It's a mess, that's what.

452
00:25:29,854 --> 00:25:30,954
I got kicked out,

453
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,471
but thank you so much
for bringing the band, Pat.

454
00:25:35,613 --> 00:25:37,571
Okay, see you.

455
00:25:41,041 --> 00:25:42,307
What are you laughing at?

456
00:25:42,307 --> 00:25:44,061
I didn't even finish the verse.

457
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:46,593
I only howled once, and then I got kicked out.

458
00:25:48,221 --> 00:25:50,287
But did your dad like it?

459
00:25:51,094 --> 00:25:52,855
He said it was good.

460
00:25:52,855 --> 00:25:54,075
Did I sing well?

461
00:25:54,075 --> 00:25:56,983
- Your makeup was good.
- Oh, Prim.

462
00:25:56,983 --> 00:25:58,223
I went to find a band,

463
00:25:58,223 --> 00:26:00,684
and I practiced the song
a hundred times in a rush, you know?

464
00:26:01,406 --> 00:26:03,302
Don't give up, okay?

465
00:26:03,302 --> 00:26:06,237
You're trying so hard to win over my dad.

466
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:08,660
How deep are you going to make me fall for you?

467
00:26:10,172 --> 00:26:12,599
Please fall deep, love.

468
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:15,020
I don't think so.
I'm afraid I'll get lost on my way home.

469
00:26:20,551 --> 00:26:21,551
Hello?

470
00:26:22,084 --> 00:26:23,084
Where are you?

471
00:26:23,746 --> 00:26:25,746
Right now, Minnie,
the daughter of my dad's friend.

472
00:26:25,746 --> 00:26:27,409
She is on her way to see you.

473
00:26:27,409 --> 00:26:30,715
She's interested in
the restaurant franchise in our mall.

474
00:26:32,270 --> 00:26:33,270
Right now?

475
00:26:34,303 --> 00:26:36,276
Wait a minute, Dad,
I'm not selling the franchise.

476
00:26:36,916 --> 00:26:39,753
Come on, let's talk first.

477
00:26:39,753 --> 00:26:41,652
Maybe we can expand the business together.

478
00:26:43,597 --> 00:26:44,597
Okay.

479
00:26:48,381 --> 00:26:49,814
I have to go discuss work.

480
00:26:50,487 --> 00:26:51,798
Will you be going anywhere?

481
00:26:52,717 --> 00:26:54,324
Pear will stay with my dad.

482
00:26:54,324 --> 00:26:56,646
I'm planning to go shopping
for some stuff at the mall.

483
00:26:57,286 --> 00:26:59,567
Then let's go together.
I'll be heading there too.

484
00:26:59,567 --> 00:27:01,724
When I'm done with my business,
I'll give you a call.

485
00:27:02,317 --> 00:27:03,317
- Okay.
- Let's go.

486
00:27:03,899 --> 00:27:05,167
Wait a minute, sir.

487
00:27:05,167 --> 00:27:06,167
What?

488
00:27:06,906 --> 00:27:08,882
Are you really going like this?

489
00:27:11,352 --> 00:27:12,654
You're right.

490
00:27:12,654 --> 00:27:14,812
I forgot. Let me change first.

491
00:27:14,812 --> 00:27:15,912
Okay.

492
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:30,766
Guys, I got a great picture.

493
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:33,514
Tuk from the outdoor restaurant section
sent it to me.

494
00:27:34,128 --> 00:27:35,581
What's this great picture?

495
00:27:39,019 --> 00:27:40,830
Oh my god.

496
00:27:40,830 --> 00:27:43,095
OMG! Who is she?

497
00:27:43,095 --> 00:27:44,954
Tell me, quick!

498
00:27:44,954 --> 00:27:46,960
Don't tell me she's our boss's new girlfriend?

499
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,859
The boss is so cruel!

500
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:51,963
Tuk said she's still around
the outdoor restaurant section.

501
00:27:51,963 --> 00:27:55,039
Anyone nearby, go take the shot quickly!

502
00:27:58,304 --> 00:28:02,041
I'm sorry for being a burden to you, Thee.

503
00:28:02,041 --> 00:28:05,101
I shouldn't have been so careless
and broken my glasses.

504
00:28:06,069 --> 00:28:08,549
With your bad eyesight,
are you sure you can go back like this?

505
00:28:09,357 --> 00:28:11,399
Do you want me to take you
to get new glasses first?

506
00:28:12,307 --> 00:28:14,473
I have a spear pair in the car.

507
00:28:14,473 --> 00:28:17,461
This is far enough, Thee.
I can go the rest of the way myself.

508
00:28:18,181 --> 00:28:19,381
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

509
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,365
Okay.

510
00:28:25,059 --> 00:28:28,238
Minnie, you've hit a pole three times today!

511
00:28:28,965 --> 00:28:30,446
Let me drive you to your car.

512
00:28:31,406 --> 00:28:32,453
It's okay.

513
00:28:32,453 --> 00:28:34,048
I can really walk back on my own.

514
00:28:34,594 --> 00:28:35,694
Thank you so much.

515
00:28:40,319 --> 00:28:41,979
You said you were coming to discuss work?

516
00:28:42,963 --> 00:28:44,691
I am discussing work.

517
00:28:44,691 --> 00:28:48,170
What work? And why do you
have to hold her like that?

518
00:28:48,716 --> 00:28:51,285
Oh, it's about the eyesight.

519
00:28:51,285 --> 00:28:52,791
- Eyesight?
- Yeah.

520
00:28:52,791 --> 00:28:55,879
Oh, so it's because her eyes are so beautiful
that you couldn't resist, huh?

521
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:01,523
Prim, Prim! Prim!

522
00:29:04,210 --> 00:29:06,483
Well, she has bad eyesight.

523
00:29:16,931 --> 00:29:17,931
Prim!

524
00:29:19,897 --> 00:29:20,897
Prim…

525
00:29:24,185 --> 00:29:26,585
Prim, you're misunderstanding.

526
00:29:26,585 --> 00:29:28,947
Minnie and I are really not like that.

527
00:29:29,869 --> 00:29:31,510
Can you come out and talk, Prim?

528
00:29:32,470 --> 00:29:35,352
No, I won't talk,
and I'm not coming out either.

529
00:29:36,174 --> 00:29:38,122
But I can explain.

530
00:29:38,122 --> 00:29:39,509
Explain what?

531
00:29:40,315 --> 00:29:42,545
And why did you have to hold her like that?

532
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:47,081
The thing is, she's really short-sighted,

533
00:29:47,628 --> 00:29:50,756
and her glasses broke,
so she ended up bumping into things.

534
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:57,414
Honestly, if it were you,
would you not help her?

535
00:29:59,351 --> 00:30:02,377
No, I'd let her get hit by a car and die.

536
00:30:04,492 --> 00:30:07,623
Prim! I know you're not that cruel.

537
00:30:12,598 --> 00:30:14,716
I really only love you, Prim.

538
00:30:20,120 --> 00:30:21,120
Prim.

539
00:30:45,086 --> 00:30:46,199
I'm sorry…

540
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:49,070
for being jealous over something
that doesn't even matter.

541
00:31:04,013 --> 00:31:05,425
If you don't stop this,

542
00:31:07,443 --> 00:31:09,495
I won't stop, either.

543
00:31:12,972 --> 00:31:13,972
Yes…

544
00:31:15,519 --> 00:31:17,553
Tonight I want to be with you, Boss.

545
00:31:57,002 --> 00:32:01,349
♫ The moment of falling in love
Feels just like this ♫

546
00:32:01,349 --> 00:32:05,263
♫ That split second when I saw you ♫

547
00:32:05,263 --> 00:32:09,119
♫ The way you smiled, the way you blushed ♫

548
00:32:09,119 --> 00:32:12,243
♫ It felt like the world slowed down ♫

549
00:32:12,243 --> 00:32:16,773
♫ The moment of falling in love
Feels just like this ♫

550
00:32:16,773 --> 00:32:20,570
♫ That fleeting instant when we met ♫

551
00:32:20,570 --> 00:32:24,386
♫ The moment we connected,
the moment our eyes met ♫

552
00:32:24,386 --> 00:32:27,612
♫ I wish I could freeze this time forever ♫

553
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:31,895
♫ In this moment, I love you ♫

554
00:32:35,370 --> 00:32:39,908
♫ In this moment, I love you ♫

555
00:33:08,591 --> 00:33:10,117
What are you doing, Boss?

556
00:33:17,046 --> 00:33:19,477
A special breakfast
from someone special like me.

557
00:33:21,990 --> 00:33:23,762
I went to buy it while you were sleeping.

558
00:33:25,392 --> 00:33:27,252
You've been taking care of me.

559
00:33:27,852 --> 00:33:30,294
Could I take care of you
and do something nice for you too?

560
00:33:36,346 --> 00:33:37,673
And what about this lotus flower?

561
00:33:38,313 --> 00:33:41,392
Oh, I tried to buy
some flowers for you this morning,

562
00:33:41,392 --> 00:33:42,994
but I couldn't find any.

563
00:33:42,994 --> 00:33:44,809
Then, I saw people giving alms,

564
00:33:44,809 --> 00:33:46,334
so I asked them for one.

565
00:33:46,334 --> 00:33:47,334
Huh?

566
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,801
If I'm not a monk…

567
00:33:50,801 --> 00:33:54,657
I feel like I'm a bedridden patient.

568
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:56,892
Let's eat.

569
00:34:03,491 --> 00:34:04,665
Is it delicious?

570
00:34:05,745 --> 00:34:07,205
No, it's not delicious at all.

571
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:08,346
Really?

572
00:34:08,346 --> 00:34:09,346
I'm just kidding.

573
00:34:10,376 --> 00:34:12,692
Come on, let me feed you.

574
00:34:17,487 --> 00:34:18,734
Is it delicious?

575
00:34:18,734 --> 00:34:20,825
It's really not delicious.
I'll go buy something else for you.

576
00:34:20,825 --> 00:34:23,177
Hey, it's fine.

577
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:24,932
Anything with you is delicious anyway.

578
00:34:34,698 --> 00:34:36,318
[Dad]

579
00:34:41,798 --> 00:34:44,158
Aren't you going to answer?
It might be something important.

580
00:34:44,798 --> 00:34:46,433
There's nothing important.

581
00:34:46,433 --> 00:34:47,533
You can keep eating.

582
00:34:58,564 --> 00:35:00,451
[President]

583
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:04,363
It must be something important.

584
00:35:06,145 --> 00:35:07,705
What's so important?

585
00:35:08,211 --> 00:35:09,891
There's nothing, you don't have to answer.

586
00:35:12,459 --> 00:35:13,559
I'll answer.

587
00:35:16,091 --> 00:35:17,491
Hello, President.

588
00:35:20,762 --> 00:35:23,382
Sure, I'll tell him.

589
00:35:24,316 --> 00:35:25,564
Alright, goodbye.

590
00:35:28,351 --> 00:35:31,157
The president wants us both to go to his house,

591
00:35:31,157 --> 00:35:33,410
but he didn't say what it's about.

592
00:35:36,052 --> 00:35:37,795
Do you know what it's about?

593
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:40,883
I don't know. How would I know?

594
00:35:41,879 --> 00:35:43,998
But I think we don't need to go. Stay here.

595
00:35:45,393 --> 00:35:48,477
No, I promised. I have to go.

596
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:02,337
Oh, perfect timing, Thee.

597
00:36:03,265 --> 00:36:04,265
- Hello.
- Hello.

598
00:36:04,992 --> 00:36:06,012
Hi, Dad.

599
00:36:07,409 --> 00:36:10,110
Did you call me for something important?

600
00:36:10,110 --> 00:36:13,773
Well, no, I just wanted to call you
to have a meal together.

601
00:36:15,348 --> 00:36:18,570
I already ate, so I'll just head out.

602
00:36:18,570 --> 00:36:20,258
Hey, why are you rushing?

603
00:36:20,258 --> 00:36:22,040
Come, sit down!

604
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:23,819
Come sit next to Alice.

605
00:36:28,011 --> 00:36:29,090
Come on.

606
00:36:30,078 --> 00:36:31,631
Come on, sit here.

607
00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:42,158
You may know the ambassador,

608
00:36:42,158 --> 00:36:44,353
but you probably haven't met his daughter yet.

609
00:36:44,353 --> 00:36:49,003
This is Alice.
And this is Prim, Thee's secretary.

610
00:36:50,183 --> 00:36:51,545
Hello, Miss Alice.

611
00:36:51,545 --> 00:36:52,545
Hello.

612
00:36:53,568 --> 00:36:58,485
It's good to have the future daughter-in-law
and the secretary meet.

613
00:37:06,277 --> 00:37:08,224
Oh, Mr. Dech.

614
00:37:08,779 --> 00:37:12,120
Hello. Am I late?

615
00:37:12,120 --> 00:37:15,000
Oh, I thought you weren't here, Mrs. Chollada.

616
00:37:16,264 --> 00:37:18,772
I wasn't at first,

617
00:37:18,772 --> 00:37:21,227
but they called to tell me Mr. Dech was here,

618
00:37:21,227 --> 00:37:25,072
so I had to hurry back to welcome you myself.

619
00:37:26,568 --> 00:37:28,273
Oh, Alice!

620
00:37:28,900 --> 00:37:30,642
It's been years since I've seen you.

621
00:37:30,642 --> 00:37:33,043
You've grown into a beautiful young lady.

622
00:37:33,926 --> 00:37:35,263
Thank you.

623
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:39,299
Oh, Thee, why are you sitting here?

624
00:37:39,299 --> 00:37:40,872
You don't like sitting here, do you?

625
00:37:40,872 --> 00:37:42,294
Go on, get up.

626
00:37:42,294 --> 00:37:45,355
Go ahead. Sit here!

627
00:37:45,355 --> 00:37:48,036
So you can enjoy your food.

628
00:37:48,036 --> 00:37:49,496
Come on, sit down.

629
00:37:51,012 --> 00:37:53,273
- Come on, Tham, sit down, too.
- Alright.

630
00:37:56,190 --> 00:37:59,305
This is Tham. Do you remember him?

631
00:38:00,738 --> 00:38:01,775
Probably not.

632
00:38:01,775 --> 00:38:05,081
Because when you met Alice,
she was only 2 years old.

633
00:38:07,648 --> 00:38:11,430
Well, Thee, talk to Alice for a bit.

634
00:38:11,430 --> 00:38:13,753
Oh? What's Thee going to talk about?

635
00:38:13,753 --> 00:38:15,588
He's not exactly good at talking.

636
00:38:15,588 --> 00:38:18,736
Tham, you should talk to her.

637
00:38:18,736 --> 00:38:20,420
- Hello.
- Hello.

638
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,457
How are you?

639
00:38:21,457 --> 00:38:25,095
Oh, Thee, how's work lately? Busy?

640
00:38:25,095 --> 00:38:27,505
Oh, Thee has been working hard all along,

641
00:38:27,505 --> 00:38:31,210
but he's great. He's now the Vice President.

642
00:38:31,210 --> 00:38:33,712
He can handle everything in my place.

643
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:37,698
As for Tham, he's very busy, too.

644
00:38:37,698 --> 00:38:39,190
Since his book became a bestseller,

645
00:38:39,190 --> 00:38:42,622
the publisher is pushing him
to write a new one quickly.

646
00:38:43,515 --> 00:38:47,410
Alice, have you read Tham's work?

647
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,305
His pen name is 'Morpheus'.

648
00:38:50,305 --> 00:38:54,339
Really? I love it! I have every book!

649
00:38:54,339 --> 00:38:56,549
Oh, isn't this fate?

650
00:38:58,231 --> 00:39:00,610
Actually, I'm working on a new book right now.

651
00:39:00,610 --> 00:39:04,576
When I finish,
should I sneak it to you to read first?

652
00:39:04,576 --> 00:39:06,135
Really?

653
00:39:06,135 --> 00:39:07,932
Thank you, Tham.

654
00:39:07,932 --> 00:39:11,174
Oh, ask for her number, so you can talk.

655
00:39:12,345 --> 00:39:14,400
- Can I ask for your LINE ID? Here.
- Sure thing.

656
00:39:18,787 --> 00:39:20,920
Hey, don't walk away!

657
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:23,277
I know you did that on purpose.

658
00:39:23,984 --> 00:39:25,245
On purpose?

659
00:39:25,245 --> 00:39:28,176
You intentionally brought Tham
to ruin my matchmaking plan, didn't you?

660
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:31,217
I didn't do anything!

661
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:36,600
It's just that Tham is charming.
I can't help it if women like him.

662
00:39:39,241 --> 00:39:40,995
Do you think I'll believe that?

663
00:39:40,995 --> 00:39:42,678
Don't think I don't know

664
00:39:42,678 --> 00:39:44,837
you've been cheering for Thee and Prim.

665
00:39:44,837 --> 00:39:48,383
Yeah, of course. I'm on Prim's team.

666
00:39:48,383 --> 00:39:49,687
Got it?

667
00:39:49,687 --> 00:39:52,844
And if you keep
getting in the way of Thee and Prim,

668
00:39:52,844 --> 00:39:56,385
I'll keep ruining your plans like this.

669
00:39:57,345 --> 00:40:00,577
You have to help me!
Why are you taking sides like this?

670
00:40:00,577 --> 00:40:02,892
This is a family business issue, you know.

671
00:40:03,405 --> 00:40:06,200
Enough! I can't take it anymore!

672
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:09,059
Can we keep "business" out of our family?

673
00:40:09,059 --> 00:40:11,638
Haven't you learned anything from the past?

674
00:40:11,638 --> 00:40:13,663
Our family has been through a very tough time.

675
00:40:13,663 --> 00:40:15,605
And how much Thee has to endure
the pain for us?

676
00:40:15,605 --> 00:40:18,120
Now that he's happy, you're destroying it.

677
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:22,348
If you truly love your child, you'd want him
to succeed in both business and love.

678
00:40:22,348 --> 00:40:24,075
Why can't you think this through?

679
00:40:28,744 --> 00:40:30,530
Rap battle, huh?

680
00:40:38,126 --> 00:40:40,154
You don't need to worry about what my dad said.

681
00:40:41,549 --> 00:40:44,862
But he won't approve of us
being together anyway.

682
00:40:45,441 --> 00:40:46,551
It's not exactly like that.

683
00:40:47,072 --> 00:40:49,354
My dad doesn't dislike you.

684
00:40:49,354 --> 00:40:52,302
He's just being pressured by grandpa.

685
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,917
You didn't tell me about this, did you?

686
00:40:56,952 --> 00:40:58,833
I didn't want you to worry unnecessarily.

687
00:40:58,833 --> 00:41:00,772
Because in the end,
the outcome will be the same.

688
00:41:00,772 --> 00:41:03,066
No matter what,
I'm not going to break up with you.

689
00:41:03,066 --> 00:41:04,907
My dear secretary.

690
00:41:14,808 --> 00:41:16,308
Hey, guys!

691
00:41:17,170 --> 00:41:20,197
I've got big, big news again.

692
00:41:21,077 --> 00:41:22,271
What?

693
00:41:22,271 --> 00:41:25,399
What's going on? This better not be fake news.

694
00:41:25,399 --> 00:41:29,955
It's not fake. This time,
there are witnesses and credible evidence.

695
00:41:29,955 --> 00:41:31,462
Listen and keep calm.

696
00:41:31,462 --> 00:41:33,840
Come on, tell me quickly.

697
00:41:33,840 --> 00:41:35,000
The Vice President…

698
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,519
and Prim.

699
00:41:36,519 --> 00:41:37,841
They're dating.

700
00:41:38,657 --> 00:41:39,969
What's that?

701
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:44,708
I'm… I'm sorry.

702
00:41:44,708 --> 00:41:45,817
What's going on?

703
00:41:45,817 --> 00:41:48,896
- I think this needs to be explained.
- Yeah, yeah.

704
00:41:48,896 --> 00:41:50,964
Tell me, tell me quickly.

705
00:41:50,964 --> 00:41:54,413
Someone saw the Vice President and Prim
at the hospital,

706
00:41:54,413 --> 00:41:57,218
walking hand in hand, all lovey-dovey,

707
00:41:57,218 --> 00:41:59,312
just like a couple.

708
00:41:59,312 --> 00:42:00,393
Are you sure?

709
00:42:00,393 --> 00:42:03,309
Maybe you mistook
someone or misunderstood the situation.

710
00:42:03,309 --> 00:42:05,970
Like when we saw them
in the food section, right?

711
00:42:06,717 --> 00:42:09,745
I think we should wait and ask Prim first.

712
00:42:09,745 --> 00:42:11,173
It might not be true after all.

713
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:15,950
But I think,
if the Vice President is really dating Prim,

714
00:42:15,950 --> 00:42:17,518
- it wouldn't be strange.
- Yeah.

715
00:42:17,518 --> 00:42:20,134
Prim is both beautiful and talented,

716
00:42:20,134 --> 00:42:22,732
so it's not surprising that
the Vice President would like her.

717
00:42:22,732 --> 00:42:23,787
- True.
- Yeah.

718
00:42:23,787 --> 00:42:25,956
If it's Prim, I totally support it.

719
00:42:25,956 --> 00:42:27,297
- Yeah.
- Right?

720
00:42:28,691 --> 00:42:30,697
I kept it a secret for so long,

721
00:42:30,697 --> 00:42:33,625
thinking it wouldn't be good,
but it turned out fine.

722
00:42:33,625 --> 00:42:34,911
What did you mutter?

723
00:42:34,911 --> 00:42:37,682
Don't tell me
you knew about this before, right?

724
00:42:37,682 --> 00:42:39,605
- Huh?
- What!

725
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:41,583
No, no, no, I didn't know.

726
00:42:41,583 --> 00:42:42,762
I know nothing!

727
00:42:42,762 --> 00:42:45,965
I really didn't know. I didn't know before.

728
00:42:45,965 --> 00:42:47,154
You're weird.

729
00:42:47,154 --> 00:42:50,180
Wait a minute, we are Prim's friends, right?

730
00:42:50,180 --> 00:42:53,923
We support her,
but if it's someone else, would they gossip?

731
00:42:54,990 --> 00:42:56,425
Yeah, right.

732
00:42:56,425 --> 00:42:59,445
Hey, do you know about
the boss and the secretary, Prim?

733
00:42:59,445 --> 00:43:02,419
I was wondering,
how did she end up being the boss's secretary?

734
00:43:02,419 --> 00:43:05,717
She's not really that skilled, just pretty.

735
00:43:05,717 --> 00:43:07,397
She must have been eyeing the boss for a while,

736
00:43:07,397 --> 00:43:09,692
Well, pretending to say
she was going to resign,

737
00:43:09,692 --> 00:43:12,459
but actually just trying to get attention.

738
00:43:12,459 --> 00:43:15,458
And today, both the secretary
and the boss are missing,

739
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:17,402
They're probably sneaking off
to be together again.

740
00:43:17,402 --> 00:43:19,522
- Again?
- You guys again?

741
00:43:20,162 --> 00:43:21,896
Do you have so much free time

742
00:43:21,896 --> 00:43:23,859
that you can't think of
doing anything creative?

743
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:25,766
You're just gossiping about others
behind their backs.

744
00:43:25,766 --> 00:43:28,985
Prim does the perfect job I've ever seen.

745
00:43:28,985 --> 00:43:30,999
Yeah, Prim is both beautiful and capable.

746
00:43:30,999 --> 00:43:32,810
It's no wonder the boss likes her.

747
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:34,436
How about this?

748
00:43:34,987 --> 00:43:38,414
Easier said than done.

749
00:43:38,414 --> 00:43:39,744
Silence…

750
00:43:39,744 --> 00:43:41,019
can hit like a slap!

751
00:43:41,019 --> 00:43:42,752
Come here!

752
00:43:42,752 --> 00:43:45,132
You bitch, come here!

753
00:43:48,285 --> 00:43:49,842
Come here! Catch them!

754
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:56,357
Come here! Grab her!

755
00:43:56,357 --> 00:43:59,002
Slap! Slap her! Now!

756
00:43:59,002 --> 00:44:00,638
- Sorry, I'm sorry!
- Make sure you hit her!

757
00:44:00,638 --> 00:44:02,945
- I'm grabbing her for you!
- Here!

758
00:44:02,945 --> 00:44:04,986
My turn!

759
00:44:04,986 --> 00:44:06,264
Come here!

760
00:44:10,127 --> 00:44:12,295
Bhum! Bhum, Bhum, Bhum!

761
00:44:12,295 --> 00:44:13,395
Bhum!

762
00:44:14,901 --> 00:44:17,080
Here! Carry her away!

763
00:44:17,080 --> 00:44:18,866
You come and grab her! Come on!

764
00:44:18,866 --> 00:44:20,146
I'll slap her myself!

765
00:44:20,146 --> 00:44:22,655
Come on! You bitch!
You die! You slapped me, huh?

766
00:44:22,655 --> 00:44:25,599
Hey! Stop, stop, stop!

767
00:44:26,771 --> 00:44:29,497
Why are you bothering me? What's your problem?

768
00:44:29,497 --> 00:44:31,805
- Why did you slap me?
- I didn't mean to slap you!

769
00:44:38,879 --> 00:44:39,913
Hey, you!

770
00:44:39,913 --> 00:44:41,241
Hey, hey!

771
00:44:42,413 --> 00:44:43,593
It's me!

772
00:44:45,828 --> 00:44:46,832
I'm sorry.

773
00:44:46,832 --> 00:44:48,488
Goody, why are you stopping me?

774
00:44:48,488 --> 00:44:49,674
What did you slap me, huh?

775
00:44:49,674 --> 00:44:52,526
- I want to slap her!
- Move aside, move aside!

776
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:54,299
Let go, let go!

777
00:45:00,064 --> 00:45:01,723
You saw that too, right?

778
00:45:03,018 --> 00:45:04,160
Give me that, you twiggy!

779
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,075
- No.
- Give it to me.

780
00:45:12,082 --> 00:45:13,182
Stop right there!

781
00:45:14,110 --> 00:45:15,930
Don't take things from others,

782
00:45:15,930 --> 00:45:19,031
And don't call Macy "Twiggy" to bully him!

783
00:45:19,759 --> 00:45:23,095
My mom and aunt taught me not to bully friends.

784
00:45:23,095 --> 00:45:24,095
How dare you?

785
00:45:28,903 --> 00:45:30,569
- What is this pose?
- Muay Thai pose.

786
00:45:30,569 --> 00:45:32,187
- Where did you learn it from?
- YouTube.

787
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,770
- Who taught you?
- Buakaw.

788
00:45:33,770 --> 00:45:36,130
A disciple has a master, huh?
Fine, I don't want it anymore.

789
00:45:44,806 --> 00:45:46,006
Thanks.

790
00:45:56,235 --> 00:45:57,608
Why are you fighting like this?

791
00:45:58,380 --> 00:46:00,062
What if you get fired?

792
00:46:01,443 --> 00:46:02,734
What were you thinking?

793
00:46:05,773 --> 00:46:08,423
I was angry for Prim.

794
00:46:08,423 --> 00:46:11,338
Angry? And what good does that do?

795
00:46:16,338 --> 00:46:17,338
Never mind.

796
00:46:18,445 --> 00:46:19,445
Are you hurt anywhere?

797
00:46:21,665 --> 00:46:22,765
Not really.

798
00:46:23,666 --> 00:46:25,470
I mean that girl. Is she hurt anywhere?

799
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:28,687
You keep beating her up.
She's about to have her intestines spill out!

800
00:46:31,183 --> 00:46:32,643
Just kidding.

801
00:46:32,643 --> 00:46:34,025
Are you hurt anywhere?

802
00:46:36,657 --> 00:46:38,654
I'm not hurt, but…

803
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,627
When I got wet, it's cold.

804
00:46:44,484 --> 00:46:45,854
Did you bring a change of clothes?

805
00:46:47,186 --> 00:46:50,045
How could I bring it? I came to work.

806
00:46:51,396 --> 00:46:53,588
But… it's fine.

807
00:46:54,296 --> 00:46:55,932
I'll just leave it and it'll dry.

808
00:46:57,646 --> 00:46:59,238
You'll probably get pneumonia and die.

809
00:47:01,756 --> 00:47:02,795
Come here.

810
00:47:02,795 --> 00:47:03,895
Where are we going?

811
00:47:05,388 --> 00:47:07,592
Bhum, let me apply the medicine for you.

812
00:47:07,592 --> 00:47:09,033
Okay.

813
00:47:09,033 --> 00:47:10,033
May I…

814
00:47:11,529 --> 00:47:13,475
That hurts.

815
00:47:13,475 --> 00:47:14,837
I haven't even done anything yet.

816
00:47:16,254 --> 00:47:17,689
Just teasing a bit.

817
00:47:17,689 --> 00:47:20,708
Oh, okay. Sorry about that.

818
00:47:20,708 --> 00:47:21,808
Alright.

819
00:47:25,523 --> 00:47:27,079
Hey, is this teasing too?

820
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:28,919
This one really hurts.

821
00:47:28,919 --> 00:47:30,492
Press gently!

822
00:47:30,492 --> 00:47:32,472
Sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

823
00:47:33,516 --> 00:47:35,220
Well… sorry.

824
00:47:37,249 --> 00:47:38,249
Okay…

825
00:47:38,844 --> 00:47:40,272
All done.

826
00:47:40,272 --> 00:47:41,771
Bhum…

827
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:43,837
Please don't get into trouble
with anyone like this.

828
00:47:43,837 --> 00:47:45,579
I'm… I'm really concerned.

829
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:54,948
Why are you concerned?
You're not my boyfriend, and you never ask.

830
00:47:57,060 --> 00:47:59,006
- Bhum…
- Yeah?

831
00:47:59,006 --> 00:48:00,106
Here's the plaster.

832
00:48:01,112 --> 00:48:02,423
Huh?

833
00:48:02,423 --> 00:48:04,176
- Please apply it yourself.
- Huh?

834
00:48:09,973 --> 00:48:13,408
You didn't even treat the wound
and made me apply it myself?

835
00:48:13,408 --> 00:48:15,257
What kind of man is this?

836
00:48:19,736 --> 00:48:23,617
"Pen, fan, gun, Piromphorn."

837
00:48:25,374 --> 00:48:27,060
Yong, what did you write on this?

838
00:48:28,123 --> 00:48:29,123
Oh.

839
00:48:31,300 --> 00:48:32,580
The "pen" is "Do you".

840
00:48:33,384 --> 00:48:34,640
The "fan" is "want to".

841
00:48:36,637 --> 00:48:37,840
The "gun" is "go out".

842
00:48:38,520 --> 00:48:40,220
And "Piromphorn" is "with me".

843
00:48:42,217 --> 00:48:43,419
Do you want to go out with me?

844
00:48:50,370 --> 00:48:51,470
You don't want to?

845
00:48:55,019 --> 00:48:57,181
Katreeya English!

846
00:48:58,226 --> 00:48:59,226
What does that mean?

847
00:48:59,828 --> 00:49:01,494
Okay, yeah?

848
00:49:18,519 --> 00:49:21,078
It's a good thing
I packed extra pants and shoes.

849
00:49:22,138 --> 00:49:24,068
You can just wear this outfit for now.

850
00:49:24,068 --> 00:49:26,319
Once your clothes are dry,
you can change back, okay?

851
00:49:29,552 --> 00:49:32,131
Yeah, okay then.

852
00:49:35,743 --> 00:49:38,964
It's good that
this shirt doesn't smell sour anymore.

853
00:49:42,513 --> 00:49:43,513
Thank you.

854
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:14,166
Is something wrong, sir?

855
00:50:15,002 --> 00:50:17,370
Am I shining brighter than usual today?

856
00:50:17,370 --> 00:50:19,183
Why is everyone looking at me strangely?

857
00:50:20,798 --> 00:50:22,324
I'm not sure,

858
00:50:23,245 --> 00:50:26,199
but everyone really is looking at us strangely.

859
00:50:30,917 --> 00:50:32,217
It's probably nothing.

860
00:50:32,217 --> 00:50:33,484
Let's go. Come on.

861
00:50:39,310 --> 00:50:40,377
Hey?

862
00:50:40,377 --> 00:50:43,894
Fah, you've already brought this for me
to sign, haven't you?

863
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:48,535
Hey, Fah!

864
00:50:48,535 --> 00:50:50,641
- Yes?
- What's on your phone?

865
00:50:50,641 --> 00:50:52,922
Why do you keep sighing?
Is there some drama going on?

866
00:50:54,219 --> 00:50:56,333
I'm just checking the group chat.

867
00:50:57,389 --> 00:50:59,632
Don't you know the news, Director?

868
00:50:59,632 --> 00:51:00,732
What news?

869
00:51:01,586 --> 00:51:03,601
Right now,
the whole company is gossiping about the fact

870
00:51:03,601 --> 00:51:06,096
that the boss is dating Prim.

871
00:51:06,096 --> 00:51:09,268
Oh, they're dating? So what's the gossip about?

872
00:51:09,268 --> 00:51:10,850
Just congratulate them then!

873
00:51:10,850 --> 00:51:12,500
Well, the gossip is that

874
00:51:12,500 --> 00:51:17,765
they're saying Prim approached the boss
because she's hoping to tie him down.

875
00:51:20,001 --> 00:51:22,842
So it's the secretary and boss dating,

876
00:51:22,842 --> 00:51:24,879
and they're gossiping about it like that.

877
00:51:24,879 --> 00:51:25,979
Yeah, that's it.

878
00:51:26,905 --> 00:51:29,211
You're screwed, Thee.

879
00:51:31,524 --> 00:51:34,640
By the way, in that group,

880
00:51:34,640 --> 00:51:37,288
what are they gossiping about Director Pat?
Tell me.

881
00:51:38,182 --> 00:51:39,335
Nothing much, really.

882
00:51:39,335 --> 00:51:41,461
You don't seem to be involved
in anything interesting.

883
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:49,127
Why does everyone look like this?

884
00:51:49,127 --> 00:51:52,041
The staff from other departments
have been talking badly about you.

885
00:51:52,041 --> 00:51:53,950
And we just couldn't stand it anymore.

886
00:51:54,984 --> 00:51:56,105
Talking badly about me?

887
00:51:56,105 --> 00:51:57,541
Yeah.

888
00:51:57,541 --> 00:52:00,931
There's a rumor that you're dating the boss.

889
00:52:00,931 --> 00:52:03,789
They said that
you intentionally went after the boss?

890
00:52:03,789 --> 00:52:04,871
Yeah.

891
00:52:04,871 --> 00:52:08,571
But I haven't told anyone that it's true yet.

892
00:52:09,966 --> 00:52:10,979
What did you say?

893
00:52:10,979 --> 00:52:13,266
Hey, you knew this?

894
00:52:15,894 --> 00:52:20,514
So, the rumor that
you're dating the boss is true?

895
00:52:20,514 --> 00:52:22,521
Well…

896
00:52:22,521 --> 00:52:23,521
So what?

897
00:52:24,210 --> 00:52:25,725
- Well…
- Well?

898
00:52:25,725 --> 00:52:27,723
At this point,
there's no need to hide it anymore.

899
00:52:34,245 --> 00:52:35,245
Boss?

900
00:52:37,149 --> 00:52:40,130
I guess I need to clear everything up
once and for all.

901
00:52:51,026 --> 00:52:53,551
Clear everything up, how?

902
00:52:55,683 --> 00:52:58,078
How would I know?
I'm just standing by your side.

903
00:52:58,766 --> 00:53:00,245
You're right.

904
00:53:11,018 --> 00:53:13,391
Here. Thank you.

905
00:53:15,947 --> 00:53:16,947
And this too.

906
00:53:30,677 --> 00:53:32,557
Attention please.

907
00:53:32,557 --> 00:53:34,542
Good afternoon, in this scorching heat,

908
00:53:34,542 --> 00:53:38,918
just like the rumors that are as intense
and fiery as they are right now.

909
00:53:38,918 --> 00:53:44,806
I'm Cholathorn Theeranonsakun, Vice President,
have something to inform everyone.

910
00:53:49,522 --> 00:53:51,691
I want to announce to everyone that…

911
00:53:51,691 --> 00:53:54,283
the rumor about me
being in a relationship with Secretary Prim…

912
00:53:59,980 --> 00:54:01,180
It's true.

913
00:54:10,999 --> 00:54:14,757
What happened is that I liked her first,
so I went ahead and pursued her.

914
00:54:18,612 --> 00:54:20,807
From now on, if there is any slander

915
00:54:20,807 --> 00:54:23,195
or anything spoken about Secretary Prim
in a bad way.

916
00:54:23,195 --> 00:54:25,759
Or make statements that deviate from the facts.

917
00:54:25,759 --> 00:54:29,602
I will have the legal team
take decisive action on the defamation charge.

918
00:54:30,978 --> 00:54:32,078
Oh…

919
00:54:33,778 --> 00:54:35,905
I want to announce to everyone that…

920
00:54:44,379 --> 00:54:45,688
I love Prim.

921
00:54:51,924 --> 00:54:53,778
Our boss is amazing!

922
00:54:54,679 --> 00:54:56,375
Congratulations.

923
00:54:59,445 --> 00:55:00,445
Is that clear?

924
00:55:01,452 --> 00:55:05,646
♫ The moment of falling in love
Feels just like this ♫

925
00:55:05,646 --> 00:55:09,800
♫ That split second when I saw you ♫

926
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,045
♫ The way you smiled… ♫

927
00:55:12,045 --> 00:55:15,524
If Thee doesn't break up with you,
he will cut ties with Thee.

928
00:55:15,524 --> 00:55:16,977
Cutting ties?

929
00:55:16,977 --> 00:55:19,697
The reason you invited me out
is that you like me, right?

930
00:55:20,538 --> 00:55:23,426
Did you ever hear about my eldest daughter?

931
00:55:23,426 --> 00:55:26,128
I'm worried that
Prim might repeat her sister's mistake.

932
00:55:26,128 --> 00:55:27,683
My life has been spent with you.

933
00:55:27,683 --> 00:55:32,478
Sometimes, closeness and attachment
can make us mistake them for love.

934
00:55:32,478 --> 00:55:35,915
I want to try living my life without you.

935
00:55:35,915 --> 00:55:37,885
Goodbye, Boss.
