Don't joke around like this, Boss!

13
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:36,539
I'm not joking.

14
00:01:36,539 --> 00:01:39,747
I'm always serious, especially when it is about you.

15
00:01:39,747 --> 00:01:42,100
What is it with you, Secretary Prim?

16
00:01:42,966 --> 00:01:46,133
I just want to resign. Is that so wrong?

17
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:56,600
Fine. If you want to resign, go ahead and leave.

21
00:02:31,233 --> 00:02:35,633
<i>I was out running and thought you should come to run with me.</i>

22
00:02:36,368 --> 00:02:37,582
Running?

23
00:02:37,582 --> 00:02:40,948
<i>Yeah. Meet me at the park right now!</i>

24
00:02:40,948 --> 00:02:44,133
Okay. I'll go right away.

00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:51,560

27
00:03:32,733 --> 00:03:34,433
Keep up, Secretary Prim.

28
00:03:34,433 --> 00:03:36,033
Yes, Boss.

29
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,900
Sorry…

30
00:04:10,389 --> 00:04:12,533
How's it going, Secretary Prim?

31
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:17,366
I know that getting to run and absorbing the morning sunlight like this,

32
00:04:17,366 --> 00:04:22,400
it refreshes you, gets your blood pumping, and clears your mind. Am I right?

33
00:04:23,833 --> 00:04:28,933
Yes, I feel full of energy and ready to work now.

34
00:04:28,933 --> 00:04:30,600
Perfect!

35
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:31,945
I had you exercise

36
00:04:31,945 --> 00:04:34,966
because walking up to the 4th floor the other day made you dead tired.

37
00:04:34,966 --> 00:04:40,066
You need to be stronger if you want to be my secretary for a long time.

38
00:04:40,066 --> 00:04:41,766
Got it?

39
00:04:41,766 --> 00:04:43,300
Yes, Boss.

<i>[7:10 Pace, 10:25]</i>

41
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,966
But your pace is only 7. You're just power walking!

42
00:04:54,966 --> 00:04:58,009
I'll have to make you run every morning from now on.

43
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,200
This is just so…

44
00:05:07,633 --> 00:05:11,566
Radiant! Radiant! Radiant!

45
00:05:18,866 --> 00:05:20,432
Wear these, or you'll be dazzled.

46
00:05:20,432 --> 00:05:23,032
The sunlight has been strong in the morning lately.

47
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,066
You're the one who needs them.

48
00:05:27,066 --> 00:05:30,966
Because you're the one who's going to be dazzled by my brilliance.

49
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,133
It's such a burden having to be this way.

50
00:05:37,133 --> 00:05:40,233
But when someone shines this brightly, nothing can hold them back.

51
00:05:40,233 --> 00:05:41,879
Isn't that right, Secretary Prim?

52
00:05:41,879 --> 00:05:43,800
So cute!

53
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,500
That smile is so sweet.

54
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:48,400
How could anyone not fall in love with you?

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,966
Such beautiful fur, too.

56
00:05:50,966 --> 00:05:53,500
Now, let me see your paws, there we go.

57
00:05:54,500 --> 00:05:56,866
So good! Very good!

58
00:05:56,866 --> 00:06:01,166
You don't bite, right? No biting, right? Good job, such a good one!

59
00:06:07,066 --> 00:06:08,380
I've rescheduled the Purchasing Department meeting

60
00:06:08,380 --> 00:06:10,540
to tomorrow noon, as instructed.

61
00:06:10,544 --> 00:06:13,033
At 11:00 a.m., there's an interview with the Asian Tomorrow page.

62
00:06:13,033 --> 00:06:14,833
They've requested 30 minutes.

63
00:06:14,833 --> 00:06:17,766
Including hair and makeup, which should take no more than an hour.

64
00:06:17,766 --> 00:06:21,033
As for the VIP zone planning meeting for the Countdown event,

65
00:06:21,033 --> 00:06:23,333
that's set for precisely 1:00 p.m.

66
00:06:23,333 --> 00:06:27,500
After that, there's a discussion with…

67
00:06:35,166 --> 00:06:36,400
Secretary Prim.

68
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,100
Secretary Prim!

69
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,866
Are you asleep right now?

70
00:06:41,466 --> 00:06:44,733
I'm sorry. I stayed up late last night.

71
00:06:44,733 --> 00:06:49,533
Should you get at least 7 to 8 hours daily for quality sleep?

72
00:06:49,533 --> 00:06:51,340
What exactly did you do?

73
00:06:53,870 --> 00:06:55,700
<i>[3:00 AM]</i>

74
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:02,436

75
00:07:02,436 --> 00:07:07,800
<i>[Boss Wee-Woo!]</i>

76
00:07:08,633 --> 00:07:10,566
<i>Yes, Boss.</i>

77
00:07:10,566 --> 00:07:15,300
<i>I want you to review the VIP guest list for the Countdown event again.</i>

78
00:07:15,300 --> 00:07:17,900
<i>All right. I'll send it to you tomorrow morning.</i>

79
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:21,300
<i>Review and send it tonight instead. I want to see it now.</i>

80
00:07:22,866 --> 00:07:24,766
<i>Okay…</i>

81
00:07:30,433 --> 00:07:32,433
<i>It's 3:00 a.m…</i>

82
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:52,333
<i>I've sent it already, Boss. I'm going to sleep now, okay?</i>

83
00:08:07,666 --> 00:08:09,100
All right, I'll just continue then.

84
00:08:09,100 --> 00:08:11,295
After that, a meeting with Mr. Somphop,

85
00:08:11,295 --> 00:08:13,541
- regarding the Korean bag franchise deal that didn't go…
- Enough!

86
00:08:13,541 --> 00:08:17,266
I don't want a failure to ruin my mood first thing in the morning.

87
00:08:18,233 --> 00:08:20,233
A failure?

88
00:08:20,233 --> 00:08:25,366
But Mr. Somphop couldn't close the deal. That's all.

89
00:08:25,366 --> 00:08:27,900
In my work, there's no such thing as "that's all".

90
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,466
Will we let our competitor take this deal just because of that?

91
00:08:32,466 --> 00:08:35,490
If we don't aim for results, if we don't push to succeed,

92
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:37,645
then what's the point of working?

93
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,333
All it takes is dedication and the will to succeed.

94
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:45,433
Why is that so hard for people to understand?

95
00:08:45,433 --> 00:08:48,266
Well, maybe because not everyone is like you, Boss.

96
00:08:48,266 --> 00:08:49,666
Perfect!

97
00:08:50,166 --> 00:08:53,833
Yes, no one's perfect except me.

98
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,033
Right.

99
00:08:55,033 --> 00:08:59,366
Boss, I've never met anyone as "absolutely perfect" as you.

100
00:09:14,666 --> 00:09:17,100
Thank you for dropping me off.

101
00:09:17,733 --> 00:09:19,900
Thank you, too, Yong.

102
00:09:21,340 --> 00:09:23,800
By the way, Mr. Khai sent over the outfit

103
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:25,400
for the Brazilian ambassador's birthday party.

104
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:29,033
I've already picked the Phthalo Green set with a black leather jacket for you.

105
00:09:29,033 --> 00:09:30,200
Hold on.

106
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:35,933
You pronounced the Phthola Green and black leather jacket wrong.

107
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:37,766
Repeat it.

108
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:41,066
Phthalo Green.

109
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:43,233
That accent is so local.

110
00:09:43,233 --> 00:09:44,400
Phthalo Green.

111
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,533
Phthalo Green.

112
00:09:45,533 --> 00:09:48,133
Not "Tha," it's Phthalo.

113
00:09:48,133 --> 00:09:50,766
- Phthalo.
- Phthalo.

114
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:54,200
Phthalo, Phthalo Green.

115
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,400
- Thalo.
- Thalo.

116
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,966
Phthalo.

117
00:09:57,966 --> 00:10:00,866
Well, I don't have your perfect pronunciation, Boss.

118
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,433
Fine.

119
00:10:05,900 --> 00:10:08,133
But even your Th isn't right.

120
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:12,200
You must touch your tongue to the top of your front teeth,

121
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,933
like this: Thuh.

122
00:10:14,933 --> 00:10:16,033
Thuh.

123
00:10:16,033 --> 00:10:17,333
Stick the tongue out more.

124
00:10:17,333 --> 00:10:18,333
Thuh.

125
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:19,666
- Thuh.
- Thuh.

126
00:10:19,666 --> 00:10:21,400
More tongue!

127
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,900
- Thuh.
- Thuh.

128
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:24,433
- Thuh.
- Thuh.

129
00:10:24,433 --> 00:10:25,766
Thuh.

130
00:10:25,766 --> 00:10:27,866
- Thuh.
- Thuh.

131
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:31,833
- Thuh.
- Okay. That's correct.

132
00:10:31,833 --> 00:10:33,433
Perfect!

133
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,166
Thank you.

134
00:10:35,166 --> 00:10:37,000
Good day.

135
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,933
Almost forgot.

136
00:10:39,933 --> 00:10:42,500
There's something personal I'd like to inform you about, Boss.

137
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:44,500
What is it?

138
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:46,000
I'm resigning.

139
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:50,300
I'm resigning. I'm resigning. I'm resigning.

140
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,100
So I wanted to let you know first.

141
00:10:55,100 --> 00:10:58,000
I'll send you the resignation letter to sign later today.

142
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,633
- Yong.
- Yes, Boss?

143
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:07,100
- Start the car.
- Yes, Boss.

144
00:11:12,833 --> 00:11:15,333
- Yong.
- Yes, Boss?

145
00:11:15,333 --> 00:11:17,900
Did Prim just say she's resigning?

146
00:11:17,900 --> 00:11:19,800
Yes, Boss. Resigning.

147
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:21,566
Resigning…

148
00:11:21,566 --> 00:11:23,633
Yes, Boss. Resigning.

149
00:11:31,066 --> 00:11:32,366
Boss? Did you forget something?

150
00:11:32,366 --> 00:11:34,566
Did you just say you were resigning?

151
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:36,600
Yes. I'm resigning.

152
00:11:37,266 --> 00:11:39,433
- Yong!
- Yes, Boss?

153
00:11:54,166 --> 00:11:56,266
<i>She's resigning?</i>

154
00:11:56,266 --> 00:11:58,333
<i>Why would she resign?</i>

155
00:12:04,933 --> 00:12:08,100
<i>Or did I give her too much work?</i>

156
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:10,933
<i>But she's never complained about anything.</i>

157
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,420
<i>Did I accidentally do something wrong?</i>

158
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,833
<i>No…</i>

159
00:12:15,833 --> 00:12:18,333
<i>Someone like me, when have I ever done anything wrong?</i>

160
00:12:18,333 --> 00:12:21,266
<i>What's going on with you, Secretary Prim?!</i>

161
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,233
<i>I've finished organizing the contract documents!</i>

162
00:12:27,333 --> 00:12:29,400
<i>This one for today's tie, okay?</i>

163
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,633
<i>How about a tea break?</i>

164
00:12:31,633 --> 00:12:33,800
<i>The car is ready. This way, Boss.</i>

165
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,266
<i>Thank you for dropping me off, Boss.</i>

166
00:12:35,266 --> 00:12:37,233
<i>Thank you for teaching me everything, Boss.</i>

167
00:12:37,233 --> 00:12:38,166
<i>Thank you so much.</i>

168
00:12:38,166 --> 00:12:42,166
<i>Boss, I've never met anyone as absolutely perfect as you.</i>

169
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:45,666
Come on! What's so bad about working with me?!

170
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:52,800
<i>Why am I even upset? Why am I even annoyed?</i>

171
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:55,566
<i>She's just a secretary. She wants to quit?</i>

172
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,562
<i>It can happen all the time.</i>

173
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,733
<i>I'm resigning!</i>

174
00:13:25,433 --> 00:13:27,700
Secretary Prim…

175
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,466
Let's see.

176
00:13:32,620 --> 00:13:34,390
Hey, Meow-meow.

177
00:13:35,933 --> 00:13:38,266
Do you think he is going to be mad

178
00:13:38,266 --> 00:13:40,833
that I told him I'm resigning like that?

179
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,700
Will he understand?

180
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,533
But he has to understand, right?

181
00:13:47,533 --> 00:13:51,633
Employees resign all the time, every year. Right?

182
00:13:53,866 --> 00:13:57,033
I wonder if he'll be able to find a new secretary…

183
00:13:59,566 --> 00:14:01,600
What do you think?

184
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
Yes, Boss?

185
00:14:11,066 --> 00:14:15,633
I don't know what to wear to work. Come pick something out for me. That's all.

186
00:14:15,633 --> 00:14:18,366
Wait! Hold on! Hello?

187
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,533
Aren't you tired of this, Meow-meow?

188
00:14:26,533 --> 00:14:30,066
Going in circles like this over and over again?

189
00:14:33,733 --> 00:14:35,333
<i>Are you almost here?</i>

190
00:14:35,333 --> 00:14:36,800
<i>Hurry up.</i>

191
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,933
Yes! I'm on my way now! If I could fly, I would've flown already!

192
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:43,366
<i>If you can fly, then fly here now.</i>

193
00:14:55,033 --> 00:14:56,533
Hello.

194
00:14:56,533 --> 00:14:58,000
You're changing the makeup artist?

195
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,904
Why is this being notified so last-minute?

196
00:14:59,904 --> 00:15:02,466
We'd like to keep the original makeup artist that was confirmed.

197
00:15:02,466 --> 00:15:05,230
Otherwise, he might not be available for the interview.

198
00:15:08,233 --> 00:15:09,300
Goody, hi.

199
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:13,700
Yes, there's a meeting this afternoon. All right, see you then. Thank you!

200
00:15:16,333 --> 00:15:19,000
I'm here! Just give me a moment.

201
00:15:27,146 --> 00:15:30,066
Let's go with this tie for today, shall we?

202
00:15:30,066 --> 00:15:31,633
Okay.

203
00:16:03,433 --> 00:16:05,233
Perfect.

204
00:16:06,233 --> 00:16:09,119
You're getting pretty used to speaking English these days?

205
00:16:09,119 --> 00:16:11,166
Of course.

206
00:16:11,166 --> 00:16:13,400
No humility at all?

207
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:16,533
Nope. You're the one who taught me, remember?

208
00:16:16,533 --> 00:16:20,733
Humility is just a trick people use when they want to be praised.

209
00:16:45,112 --> 00:16:47,072
What's wrong, Secretary Prim?

210
00:16:47,551 --> 00:16:48,933
Nothing.

211
00:16:48,933 --> 00:16:50,733
That's my water.

212
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,000
Sorry!

213
00:16:59,123 --> 00:17:01,300
About what you said this morning.

214
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,966
You're resigning because I dragged you out for a run and you got mad.

215
00:17:03,966 --> 00:17:06,133
So, this is payback, right?

216
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:08,800
- No, that's not it—
- Okay. I get it now.

217
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:11,433
- Get what, exactly?
- I forgive you.

218
00:17:11,433 --> 00:17:12,533
Wait? Forgive me for what?

219
00:17:12,533 --> 00:17:15,866
For being mad at me. I forgive you.

220
00:17:22,433 --> 00:17:24,233
Hello, Pat?

221
00:17:24,233 --> 00:17:27,333
Don't do anything. I'll handle it myself.

222
00:17:28,933 --> 00:17:31,233
I need to borrow 15 minutes from the interview schedule.

223
00:17:31,233 --> 00:17:33,700
I have to deal with a scumbag real quick.

224
00:17:41,966 --> 00:17:44,566
So, you're not resigning anymore. Right?

225
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:47,766
Perfect!

226
00:18:31,320 --> 00:18:33,060
<i>[Lucky Box]</i>

227
00:18:38,870 --> 00:18:40,050
<i>[Thiranon Group]</i>

228
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,060
<i>Was the manager's salary not enough, Mr. Wichai?</i>

229
00:18:41,060 --> 00:18:43,560
Is that why you did this?

230
00:18:43,566 --> 00:18:46,333
I-I…

231
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,066
I can explain, Boss.

232
00:18:49,066 --> 00:18:51,300
I really needed the money, Boss. I had no choice…

233
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:54,233
And who doesn't need money?

234
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:57,600
That doesn't give you the right to betray the company that's taken care of you.

235
00:18:57,600 --> 00:18:58,533
But, Boss, I…

236
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:02,266
I'm only giving you a chance because you used to work for my father.

237
00:19:02,266 --> 00:19:04,400
You know what you need to do.

238
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,966
Miss Prim, I don't want to resign.

239
00:19:15,966 --> 00:19:18,966
I never meant to embezzle.

240
00:19:18,966 --> 00:19:21,100
It was that damn gambling house…

241
00:19:21,666 --> 00:19:27,000
I mean, no, Miss Prim, I didn't mean to get involved with gambling.

242
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:31,400
A client dragged me in, and I didn't want to play.

243
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:36,988
Please, Miss Prim, talk to him. Help me, please.

244
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:41,000
Come with me, please.

245
00:19:55,533 --> 00:19:57,600
What's going on, Miss Prim?

246
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:01,566
You know how much he hates corruption in this organization.

247
00:20:01,566 --> 00:20:03,500
I've already packed up your things.

248
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:05,000
Thank you for your resignation.

249
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,800
Miss Prim…

250
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,800
Please take him to the infirmary.

251
00:20:14,800 --> 00:20:16,310
But if there's any medical cost involved,

252
00:20:16,310 --> 00:20:19,330
make sure he pays for everything himself.

253
00:20:19,333 --> 00:20:20,733
Yes, ma'am.

254
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:27,300
Bhum, the interview team from Asian Tomorrow is here.

255
00:20:27,300 --> 00:20:31,766
Okay! Thank you. Please print out the script I revised, too.

256
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:33,466
Thank you, thank you.

257
00:20:33,466 --> 00:20:36,666
Prosperity! Go, prosperity! Prosperity, prosperity, prosperity!

258
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:41,133
Prosperity, prosperity, prosperity! Wealthy!

259
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,800
- Prosperity! Prosperity!
- Stop it!

260
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:49,033
Goody, what are you even doing? The interview team is already here!

261
00:20:49,033 --> 00:20:51,600
- Bad luck!
- What bad luck?! What are you talking?

262
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:54,833
Oh my god, where did you even get that holy water bowl from?!

263
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:58,300
I went on a pilgrimage and brought it from the Sacred Kilen Cave Temple!

264
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:02,800
So our office would thrive and be full of success.

265
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:06,100
But you're wearing a scarf in a cursed color!

266
00:21:06,100 --> 00:21:08,800
You're blocking all our good luck and prosperity!

267
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,866
Such a bad omen!

268
00:21:10,866 --> 00:21:12,800
Bad omen?! Excuse me?!

269
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,866
Do you know how hard it was to get this scarf?

270
00:21:14,866 --> 00:21:17,466
I bought it at a boutique in Italy for over 10,000 baht!

271
00:21:17,466 --> 00:21:19,966
Wasn't that 250 baht from Sampeng Market?

272
00:21:19,966 --> 00:21:22,059
199, okay?! They gave me a discount.

273
00:21:22,059 --> 00:21:23,166
Taking it off or not?!

274
00:21:23,166 --> 00:21:24,300
Are you nuts? No way!

275
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,733
If you won't take it off, I'll splash you!

276
00:21:26,733 --> 00:21:31,633
What?! Don't! Goody! No!

277
00:21:36,630 --> 00:21:38,433
Oh my god!

278
00:21:39,033 --> 00:21:43,166
What have you done?! What if she gets sick?

279
00:21:43,166 --> 00:21:45,206
You never think before you act!

280
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:50,200
I'm going to check on the interview now.

281
00:21:51,066 --> 00:21:53,433
Looking good though…

282
00:21:53,433 --> 00:21:55,033
Interview time!

283
00:22:01,966 --> 00:22:05,300
Careful not to catch a cold, okay? We're just worried about you.

284
00:22:12,266 --> 00:22:15,566
Nice. Nice.

285
00:22:19,366 --> 00:22:21,666
- Like a Greek statue!
- Looking good!

286
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:31,650
Excuse me, Boss, just a little shine on your face.

287
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,660
Allow me to blot it gently.

288
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,333
And in case anyone here doesn't already know,

289
00:22:40,333 --> 00:22:42,133
though I do,

290
00:22:42,133 --> 00:22:45,400
our boss here drinks at least two liters of water daily.

291
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:47,800
That's why his skin is so clear, hydrated, and dewy.

292
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,433
Honestly, no retouching needed. Right, everyone? So handsome!

293
00:22:51,433 --> 00:22:53,300
Sorry, but who asked?

294
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,800
I wanted to share, is that a problem?!

295
00:22:55,800 --> 00:22:58,300
- Done.
- Please, go ahead.

296
00:22:59,960 --> 00:23:01,566
Excuse me, move!

297
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,666
I'll hold that for you, Miss Bhum.

298
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,900
Okay, I'm ready.

299
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:16,133
Excuse me, just a moment.

300
00:23:25,100 --> 00:23:26,966
Where were you?

301
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,979
Off writing your resignation letter?

302
00:23:32,066 --> 00:23:33,966
I haven't written it yet.

303
00:23:34,600 --> 00:23:38,066
Good. Even if you did, I wouldn't approve it.

304
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:44,400
Let's begin, then.

305
00:23:46,866 --> 00:23:49,066
So handsome!

306
00:23:49,066 --> 00:23:53,133
He hasn't even started shooting! Getting ahead of yourself much?

307
00:23:53,133 --> 00:23:54,700
But he is handsome!

308
00:23:54,700 --> 00:23:56,900
Let me begin with the first question.

309
00:23:56,900 --> 00:24:01,033
How do you feel about being named one of Asia's top 5 hottest CEOs?

310
00:24:03,300 --> 00:24:06,466
I've always been hot, so I wouldn't know how I'm supposed to feel.

311
00:24:06,466 --> 00:24:12,633
Oh my gosh, that's a mic-drop answer right there!

312
00:24:12,633 --> 00:24:14,300
Annoying.

313
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:17,666
We heard that Thiranon Group has expanded into neighboring countries.

314
00:24:17,666 --> 00:24:19,966
How has the response been?

315
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:25,066
Over the past five years,

316
00:24:25,066 --> 00:24:28,400
across five branches in two countries,

317
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:31,433
we've seen consistent profit growth.

318
00:24:31,433 --> 00:24:32,933
Most recently,

319
00:24:32,933 --> 00:24:38,700
our total profit reached 26.702 billion baht,

320
00:24:38,700 --> 00:24:43,133
a 12.6% increase from the previous year.

321
00:24:43,133 --> 00:24:44,833
That's not correct.

322
00:24:46,066 --> 00:24:52,566
12.6% is the rounded figure. The exact number is 12.58116%.

323
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,470
<i>[12.58116%]</i>

324
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,400
Yes, you're right, Boss. That's correct.

325
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,266
Also, I believe the fifth branch should be performing better.

326
00:25:07,266 --> 00:25:09,366
We must target Thai craft products,

327
00:25:09,366 --> 00:25:12,300
which have the highest revenue and profit growth.

328
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:15,800
We should allocate more space to that category.

329
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,333
Mr. Pat, come up with a plan and present it to me.

330
00:25:19,333 --> 00:25:20,900
Yes, Boss.

331
00:25:20,900 --> 00:25:24,133
If there's nothing else, that's all. Everyone, follow up accordingly.

332
00:25:24,133 --> 00:25:25,833
Thanks, everyone.

333
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:31,410
With your nonstop work schedule,

334
00:25:31,410 --> 00:25:34,630
Mr. Thi, how do you maintain your work-life balance?

335
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:38,566
I don't have a work-life balance because it's all the same to me.

336
00:25:39,533 --> 00:25:46,000
Work isn't a duty or a burden. It's like breathing in and out.

337
00:25:48,666 --> 00:25:52,466
I can work and relax at the same time.

338
00:26:08,733 --> 00:26:13,600
Work is how I create value in myself. That's who I am.

339
00:26:14,233 --> 00:26:16,666
That was incredible, Boss!

340
00:26:18,533 --> 00:26:21,366
I can't stand fangirls like you, who always squeal over Boss.

341
00:26:21,366 --> 00:26:23,985
- Stop it.
- You're too much.

342
00:26:23,985 --> 00:26:26,300
It's cute.

343
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:27,700
That?

344
00:26:30,533 --> 00:26:32,966
By the way, have you heard?

345
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,700
Heard what?

346
00:26:45,630 --> 00:26:47,600
Is something going on?

347
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:50,100
Is it true? That you're quitting?

348
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,866
How did you know?

349
00:26:52,866 --> 00:26:54,666
I heard it from her.

350
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,633
I heard it from him.

351
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:58,966
I heard it from Yong.

352
00:26:58,966 --> 00:27:01,533
But he's not here.

353
00:27:01,533 --> 00:27:05,733
We've been together for nine years, and now you're suddenly running off like this?

354
00:27:05,733 --> 00:27:07,559
It's not sudden, Bhum.

355
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,532
I've thought about it for a while.

356
00:27:09,532 --> 00:27:12,200
Wait, do you have a problem with Boss?

357
00:27:12,900 --> 00:27:15,700
No, it's nothing like that. It's purely a personal decision.

358
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:20,400
Then where will he find a secretary who gets him like you do?

359
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:21,666
Exactly!

360
00:27:21,666 --> 00:27:25,666
I don't think he's going to sign that resignation letter easily.

361
00:27:25,666 --> 00:27:28,433
But this is a basic employee right!

362
00:27:28,433 --> 00:27:30,533
Why wouldn't I be allowed to quit?

363
00:27:30,533 --> 00:27:32,833
Either way, I'm resigning.

364
00:27:37,766 --> 00:27:41,766
See! It's your fault, wearing that cursed-colored scarf!

365
00:27:41,766 --> 00:27:44,266
That's why Prim is quitting. Take it off now!

366
00:27:44,266 --> 00:27:45,940
You failed every logic test in school?

367
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:47,290
What does my scarf relate to this?

368
00:27:47,295 --> 00:27:49,366
- Take it off or not?
- Nope.

369
00:27:49,366 --> 00:27:50,800
- If you don't…
- What?

370
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:54,066
The two of us… are going to strip you down.

371
00:27:54,066 --> 00:27:55,866
- What?!
- Take it off! Bhum!!

372
00:27:55,866 --> 00:27:59,533
- Take it off! Take it off right now!
- Don't you dare come near me!

373
00:28:01,966 --> 00:28:04,566
So annoying! What's wrong with you, sis?!

374
00:28:04,566 --> 00:28:07,000
I just don't get it. Why would Prim resign?

375
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:11,066
Is it because she's overworked and can't take it anymore?

376
00:28:11,066 --> 00:28:13,466
Poor thing.

377
00:28:14,333 --> 00:28:17,400
Are you feeling sorry, or are you happy?

378
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:18,433
Happy about what?

379
00:28:18,433 --> 00:28:21,973
Well, now you can offer to be her replacement.

380
00:28:21,973 --> 00:28:26,900
Come on, I know your every intention inside and out!

381
00:28:26,900 --> 00:28:29,066
Oh, stop! Calm down!

382
00:28:29,066 --> 00:28:32,566
I might want to be the assistant to the Vice President

383
00:28:32,566 --> 00:28:35,366
so I can be close to my idol.

384
00:28:35,366 --> 00:28:36,610
But it doesn't mean I'd stoop so low

385
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:38,730
as to cut someone else's legs off for it!

386
00:28:38,733 --> 00:28:43,266
That's right. It's a good thing. Being an assistant like Prim is exhausting.

387
00:28:43,266 --> 00:28:46,466
She barely has time to eat with us.

388
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:49,266
If you took the job, you wouldn't have time to shop.

389
00:28:49,266 --> 00:28:52,600
I can shop online!

390
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:55,666
But seriously, if Prim resigns,

391
00:28:55,666 --> 00:29:00,500
the new assistant can only be

392
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:05,266
perfectly well-mannered, talented, charming,

393
00:29:05,266 --> 00:29:11,700
and with an excellent attitude like Manchuporn Thakingsak, me!

394
00:29:15,166 --> 00:29:17,166
You're too much.

395
00:29:21,500 --> 00:29:24,666
Salary's in!

396
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,066
Bonus, too!

397
00:29:26,066 --> 00:29:29,433
Now I can buy gifts for Phon!

398
00:29:29,433 --> 00:29:32,433
Wait, his name is Phon?

399
00:29:32,433 --> 00:29:34,733
Salary is equal to spoiling the guy.

400
00:29:34,733 --> 00:29:36,333
- Spoil the guy, spoil the guy.
- Always!

401
00:29:36,333 --> 00:29:38,510
I'm in such a good mood, and with this bonus,

402
00:29:38,510 --> 00:29:42,400
I should buy food for Prim!

403
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,860
No need to go yourself, Ms. Bhum.

404
00:29:43,860 --> 00:29:47,060
I'll go buy it. Please enjoy your meal.

405
00:29:47,633 --> 00:29:49,333
Thank you!

406
00:29:51,633 --> 00:29:56,033
Girl, the way he cares for you is so sweet.

407
00:29:56,033 --> 00:29:58,483
Even if you don't get the Vice President,

408
00:29:58,483 --> 00:30:00,333
you'll get Yong instead!

409
00:30:00,333 --> 00:30:02,266
- So cute!
- Thank you!

410
00:30:02,266 --> 00:30:04,900
You're welcome! What now?

411
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:09,024
Stop it. Stop pushing this. Use your brain cells for something else!

412
00:30:09,024 --> 00:30:11,285
- Just open your heart!
- Open my heart for what?

413
00:30:11,285 --> 00:30:13,566
Remember? You used to like me back when I played soccer.

414
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:19,333
Peeking, glancing, I saw it. You liked me when I looked a bit manly.

415
00:30:19,333 --> 00:30:20,966
You fooled me so well back then!

416
00:30:20,966 --> 00:30:24,066
"Hi there, I'm off to play soccer." "Am I cool or what?"

417
00:30:24,066 --> 00:30:26,933
- The world's ending!
- Open your heart!

418
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:29,200
<i>[The house mortgage has been fully redeemed.]</i>

419
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:35,366
<i>[Ms. Primala, you can come to the bank to collect the deed now.]</i>

420
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:45,700
<i>[Bonus Salary]</i>

421
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:58,521
Are you satisfied?

422
00:31:01,533 --> 00:31:03,166
Excuse me?

423
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:06,566
The bonus I gave you, are you satisfied with it?

424
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:09,500
Thank you very much, Boss.

425
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,833
Do you have any tasks for me?

426
00:31:11,833 --> 00:31:15,333
No tasks. But I do have a proposal for you.

427
00:31:15,933 --> 00:31:17,633
A proposal?

428
00:31:17,633 --> 00:31:20,666
I'm going to raise your salary. You'll also get a personal driver,

429
00:31:20,666 --> 00:31:23,400
move to a condo closer to the office,

430
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:26,366
and I'll give you company shares. Sounds good?

431
00:31:26,366 --> 00:31:29,833
Is all of this just so I don't quit?

432
00:31:29,833 --> 00:31:31,360
Yes.

433
00:31:31,833 --> 00:31:34,933
- Then I have to decline.
- What?

434
00:31:34,933 --> 00:31:38,433
I've already made up my mind to resign, so I will.

435
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:45,166
<i>I worked so hard on this plan, and it's not working?</i>

436
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:49,733
Can I at least get a reason?

437
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:53,170
I want to live a different kind of life.

438
00:31:53,170 --> 00:31:55,233
Different how?

439
00:31:55,233 --> 00:31:58,300
The kind I've never lived before.

440
00:31:58,300 --> 00:31:59,906
But…

441
00:32:04,666 --> 00:32:07,840
Hello? You've arrived?

442
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:09,330
Okay.

443
00:32:10,733 --> 00:32:15,166
We'll talk about this later. Right now, come have lunch with my parents.

444
00:32:15,166 --> 00:32:19,466
But isn't that a private family meal?

445
00:32:19,466 --> 00:32:22,092
My family can include you, too.

446
00:32:22,092 --> 00:32:23,866
See you downstairs.

447
00:32:39,300 --> 00:32:43,300
This new restaurant was inspired by a tugboat transporting sand.

448
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:46,600
It serves Michelin-level Thai cuisine in perfect bite-sized portions,

449
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:51,233
with over a hundred dishes rotating adorably on a conveyor belt.

450
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:56,200
Good idea! Tourists will love this.

451
00:32:56,200 --> 00:33:03,044
If this branch does well, you should open the next one in Phuket.

452
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:09,400
Prim, dear, try the pomelo salad. It's delicious.

453
00:33:09,400 --> 00:33:11,159
Yes, ma'am.

454
00:33:18,254 --> 00:33:21,833
Why didn't you bring your girlfriend, Jinny?

455
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,900
Why would I?

456
00:33:22,900 --> 00:33:25,033
Well, aren't you and Jinny…?

457
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:27,266
Jinny and I aren't dating, Dad.

458
00:33:27,266 --> 00:33:28,433
What?

459
00:33:28,433 --> 00:33:30,933
Oh, stop saying "what" over and over again.

460
00:33:30,933 --> 00:33:32,666
How can I not be confused?

461
00:33:32,666 --> 00:33:36,100
You're always out and about with her.

462
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,300
What do you call that then?

463
00:33:39,300 --> 00:33:41,900
Talking stage, right, Prim?

464
00:33:44,766 --> 00:33:47,600
Really, what's there to talk about that much?

465
00:33:47,600 --> 00:33:52,066
Jinny is the daughter of Minister Damrong.

466
00:33:52,766 --> 00:33:57,166
She's a good match. Just get married already.

467
00:33:57,166 --> 00:34:02,966
Don't meddle in the kid's personal life so much.

468
00:34:05,433 --> 00:34:12,066
If she's not his girlfriend, I may push Prim into the race instead.

469
00:34:13,666 --> 00:34:14,666
I'm sorry.

470
00:34:14,666 --> 00:34:18,833
You're being ridiculous. That's not possible.

471
00:34:24,166 --> 00:34:27,666
Prim, you see Jinny a lot, don't you?

472
00:34:27,666 --> 00:34:30,800
Help encourage things between her and him a bit.

473
00:34:33,633 --> 00:34:37,000
I'd rather not interfere in his matters.

474
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:40,400
Besides, I'm planning to resign.

475
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:43,966
- What? Resign?!
- What? Resign?!

476
00:34:43,966 --> 00:34:45,533
Yes.

477
00:34:51,133 --> 00:34:54,766
So, why do you want to leave?

478
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:59,000
Is it because you hate me? Is that it?

479
00:34:59,933 --> 00:35:02,300
I don't hate you.

480
00:35:03,747 --> 00:35:05,547
Then why?

481
00:35:07,333 --> 00:35:10,400
I said tell me. That's an order!

482
00:35:11,033 --> 00:35:12,700
I want to live my life.

483
00:35:12,700 --> 00:35:14,766
I want to be Primala, not just "Secretary Prim"

484
00:35:14,766 --> 00:35:18,066
whose entire life revolves around work and you nearly every day.

485
00:35:18,066 --> 00:35:20,366
You might see work as your breath,

486
00:35:20,366 --> 00:35:22,166
but it's not like that for others.

487
00:35:22,166 --> 00:35:25,233
I genuinely appreciate the bonus and all the offers you made.

488
00:35:25,233 --> 00:35:27,266
But what I want isn't what you're offering.

489
00:35:27,266 --> 00:35:29,366
What I want is my life.

490
00:35:29,366 --> 00:35:31,933
I'll continue working until the end of next month.

491
00:35:31,933 --> 00:35:35,386
If you don't let me quit, I'll tell the Labor Department.

492
00:35:35,386 --> 00:35:37,000
Excuse me.

493
00:35:37,000 --> 00:35:38,726
Goodbye.

494
00:35:54,266 --> 00:35:56,300
<i>[Thai BBQ]</i>

495
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:59,066
So that means…

496
00:35:59,066 --> 00:36:01,900
Does that mean we got the house back?

497
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:03,652
Yes.

498
00:36:09,900 --> 00:36:12,466
Prim, did you pay a lot this time?

499
00:36:12,466 --> 00:36:14,800
Why didn't you tell me? I could've helped.

500
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:18,566
What would you help with? Just save your money for Ploen's tuition.

501
00:36:18,566 --> 00:36:21,300
Besides, the last payment wasn't that expensive,

502
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:23,400
just paying off the interest.

503
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,300
Dad, seriously. He partnered with those awful friends and lost the house.

504
00:36:28,300 --> 00:36:31,933
If Mom were still here, she would've snapped his neck for sure!

505
00:36:31,933 --> 00:36:35,166
Look at what he's put you through for all these years.

506
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:37,566
Don't blame Dad.

507
00:36:37,566 --> 00:36:40,233
He's not a bad person, just too kind.

508
00:36:40,233 --> 00:36:43,333
Honestly, I wasn't struggling. I'm fine.

509
00:36:43,333 --> 00:36:45,566
Fine? Seriously, Prim?

510
00:36:45,566 --> 00:36:47,833
You've been the one carrying this whole family.

511
00:36:47,833 --> 00:36:51,100
You paid off the bank, got our house back,

512
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,100
helped raise Ploen,

513
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:55,766
and even paid for her school fees, too!

514
00:36:55,766 --> 00:36:59,433
Now that the house is taken care of, you no longer have to worry.

515
00:36:59,433 --> 00:37:01,136
Time to take a break.

516
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:04,466
Don't worry. I'll take a break real soon.

517
00:37:16,566 --> 00:37:20,866
Prim! Prim!

518
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,733
Prim, it's okay! Just a blown transformer!

519
00:37:24,733 --> 00:37:26,733
It's okay! I'm here, I'm here.

520
00:37:26,733 --> 00:37:28,733
Breathe, breathe. Deep breaths, Prim.

521
00:37:28,733 --> 00:37:31,633
Deep breaths, it's going to be okay.

522
00:37:36,533 --> 00:37:39,966
Come on! Look at your face, look at you!

523
00:37:39,966 --> 00:37:43,733
You're taking this hard, huh, Mr. Boss?

524
00:37:43,733 --> 00:37:45,900
Why are you so worked up because your secretary quit?

525
00:37:45,900 --> 00:37:47,666
Is it that big of a deal?

526
00:37:47,666 --> 00:37:50,517
You didn't act like this when Paeng, your previous secretary,

527
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:52,366
left for maternity leave and never returned.

528
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:55,733
It's different. Prim has been with me for 9 years.

529
00:37:55,733 --> 00:37:58,133
Exactly, 9 years.

530
00:37:58,133 --> 00:38:01,500
Maybe she wants to live her life and do something else for once?

531
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:05,866
You worked her like crazy, calling her at 3:00 a.m., seriously?

532
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:07,500
Well, I came up with ideas at that time.

533
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,066
I feared I'd forget, so I had to call her immediately.

534
00:38:10,066 --> 00:38:13,433
With the way you act,

535
00:38:13,433 --> 00:38:15,933
you're either her dad or her husband.

536
00:38:15,933 --> 00:38:21,066
She doesn't want to keep living her life tied to you anymore.

537
00:38:27,245 --> 00:38:29,445
So what should I do?

538
00:38:29,445 --> 00:38:33,233
First of all, ease up a bit.

539
00:38:33,233 --> 00:38:35,766
Let her have some time to rest.

540
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:02,560
Here I come.

541
00:39:02,560 --> 00:39:04,900
Meow-meow. Time to eat!

542
00:39:10,566 --> 00:39:13,600
<i>So, why do you want to leave?</i>

543
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:15,333
<i>I want to live my life.</i>

544
00:39:15,333 --> 00:39:16,433
<i>I want to be Primala</i>

545
00:39:16,433 --> 00:39:19,033
<i>not just "Secretary Prim" whose entire life revolves around work</i>

546
00:39:19,033 --> 00:39:21,333
<i>and you nearly every day.</i>

547
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,900
<i>I'll continue working until the end of next month.</i>

548
00:39:23,900 --> 00:39:26,940
<i>If you don't let me quit, I'll tell the Labor Department.</i>

549
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,166
After saying all that,

550
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:33,166
will I even be able to resign, Meow-meow?

551
00:39:50,110 --> 00:39:51,666
Yes, Boss?

552
00:39:51,666 --> 00:39:53,370
Tomorrow, I'm giving you permission to start work in the afternoon.

553
00:39:53,370 --> 00:39:55,240
Just for one day.

554
00:39:55,246 --> 00:39:57,033
What?

555
00:39:57,033 --> 00:40:00,166
I just want you to get some rest. That's all.

556
00:40:05,030 --> 00:40:07,566
Start in the afternoon?

557
00:40:08,760 --> 00:40:10,833
Rest?

558
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:13,533
What's with him?

559
00:40:15,466 --> 00:40:20,400
Being this kind, let's see if she still wants to resign.

560
00:40:21,433 --> 00:40:24,133
Should I be happy about this, Meow-meow?

561
00:40:26,710 --> 00:40:29,920
<i>[Bar]</i>

562
00:40:34,266 --> 00:40:35,933
Hello there, handsome!

563
00:40:35,933 --> 00:40:41,300
That guy's cute, too. Hi there!

564
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,931
Girl, you're blowing my mind right now!

565
00:40:51,931 --> 00:40:54,166
Kiew, how do you even know about this place?

566
00:40:54,166 --> 00:40:59,233
Well, one of my event clients gave me a membership card.

567
00:40:59,233 --> 00:41:02,700
So I brought you two here to share this fabulous experience!

568
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:06,033
Hi, handsome!

569
00:41:06,633 --> 00:41:09,333
Listen, Prim. Tonight, let your spirit free.

570
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:11,933
Release all that stress your boss has locked you under.

571
00:41:11,933 --> 00:41:13,700
Let loose with all these gorgeous men.

572
00:41:13,700 --> 00:41:15,733
Go all out!

573
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:22,266
Yes! Because tonight, my husband and kid gave me the green light.

574
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:25,065
So drink. Get wasted!

575
00:41:25,065 --> 00:41:27,400
Are you sure this is a good idea?

576
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:30,400
- Drink!
- Cheers!

577
00:41:46,650 --> 00:41:47,833
Cheers!

578
00:41:47,833 --> 00:41:50,833
- Yeah, yeah!
- Yeah, yeah!

579
00:41:51,633 --> 00:41:54,546
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

580
00:41:54,546 --> 00:41:56,200
Cheers!

581
00:41:56,200 --> 00:41:59,200
Prim, you're cheering so much I can't even keep up.

582
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:00,630
Why are we clinking glasses this much?

583
00:42:00,630 --> 00:42:03,066
I'm seriously about to burp myself into a vomit.

584
00:42:03,066 --> 00:42:06,133
Fine, I'll drink on my own.

585
00:42:11,866 --> 00:42:16,966
Prim, what the heck did you bring with you? Did you pack your whole house?

586
00:42:16,966 --> 00:42:19,566
Just in case my boss needs something.

587
00:42:19,566 --> 00:42:23,000
Taking care of him like that,

588
00:42:23,000 --> 00:42:24,800
are you trying to turn him into your man?

589
00:42:24,800 --> 00:42:26,866
We see you.

590
00:42:26,866 --> 00:42:29,666
Shut up! No way!

591
00:42:30,300 --> 00:42:35,633
Oh, you say no, but your heart's screaming "yes," isn't it?

592
00:42:40,733 --> 00:42:43,533
Make him your man! Go make him your man!

593
00:42:43,533 --> 00:42:46,000
Gimme that!

594
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:48,700
You know this is important.

595
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:51,833
But since you're so lovely, I'll let you have it.

596
00:42:51,833 --> 00:42:56,966
Consider it a thank-you reward for the great service.

597
00:43:02,733 --> 00:43:05,900
Prim, step aside, girl!

598
00:43:05,900 --> 00:43:09,033
Greetings, Boss!

599
00:43:11,285 --> 00:43:17,722
Miss Secretary, do you have anything you'd like to say to your beloved boss?

600
00:43:17,722 --> 00:43:19,822
Yes, I do.

601
00:43:25,491 --> 00:43:28,053
So full of yourself! So picky!

602
00:43:28,053 --> 00:43:30,313
So arrogant! So self-absorbed!

603
00:43:30,313 --> 00:43:33,718
You think you're Mr. Perfect or something?

604
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:39,066
Now you're gonna get it!

605
00:43:39,066 --> 00:43:40,866
This!

606
00:43:42,037 --> 00:43:44,037
Here, take off your tie!

607
00:43:45,011 --> 00:43:46,820
Faster!

608
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:48,720
Take off your shirt, too!

609
00:44:00,666 --> 00:44:03,000
Everyone, say it together.

610
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:05,033
- Perfect!
- Perfect!

611
00:44:05,033 --> 00:44:06,800
- What was that?
- Perfect!

612
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:08,400
- Louder!
- Perfect!

613
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,700
Perfect!

614
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:12,733
- Perfect!
- Perfect!

615
00:44:33,870 --> 00:44:38,039
<i>I randomly saw this on social media and thought I'd send it to you.</i>

618
00:44:49,433 --> 00:44:50,466
<i>Yes, I do.</i>

619

<i>[7:00 AM]</i>

624
00:45:10,700 --> 00:45:13,166
Yes, Boss.

625
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:17,133
Secretary Prim, get to my house immediately.

626
00:45:18,780 --> 00:45:22,733
But didn't you tell me to come into work this afternoon?

627
00:45:22,733 --> 00:45:25,833
Come to my house. Now!

628
00:45:30,112 --> 00:45:33,133
When is the world going to end already?

629
00:45:40,566 --> 00:45:42,700
Sorry, I'm late.

630
00:45:50,479 --> 00:45:52,845
You're wearing this tie today, okay?

631
00:45:54,156 --> 00:45:55,290
So, you want to resign

632
00:45:55,290 --> 00:45:58,180
because you want to tie someone else's tie, is that it?

633
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,400
What do you mean?

634
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:03,833
I've never tied a tie for anyone other than you.

635
00:46:05,530 --> 00:46:08,473
- Then what's this?
<i>- So picky! So arrogant!</i>

<i>You think you're Mr. Perfect or something?</i>

638
00:46:14,166 --> 00:46:16,933
I… I mean… I… last night… I…

639
00:46:16,933 --> 00:46:19,433
I gave you the morning off because I was worried you'd burn out.

640
00:46:19,433 --> 00:46:21,981
I didn't expect you'd use it to go hang out instead.

641
00:46:21,981 --> 00:46:25,800
I'm sorry, Boss. I'll ask my friends to delete the clip right away.

642
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:27,180
It's too late.

643
00:46:27,180 --> 00:46:29,066
Even if it's deleted, someone's already saved it.

644
00:46:29,066 --> 00:46:30,425
Have you even thought, Secretary Prim,

645
00:46:30,425 --> 00:46:32,733
about the digital footprint you left yesterday?

646
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:35,200
How many hundreds or thousands of years it will stay with you?

647
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:38,333
I'm not going to forgive you that easily!

648
00:46:39,000 --> 00:46:41,100
Then, what do you want me to do?

649
00:46:41,100 --> 00:46:42,866
Should I…

650
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,378
Resign?!

651
00:46:45,378 --> 00:46:47,086
Don't even think about it.

652
00:46:47,086 --> 00:46:48,891
No, Boss.

653
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:54,366
I want to make it up to you. Whatever you want me to do, just tell me.

654
00:46:56,380 --> 00:46:58,019
All right!

655
00:46:58,019 --> 00:47:00,000
You said it yourself.

656
00:47:00,000 --> 00:47:02,550
You'll have a chance to make it up to me.

657
00:47:17,151 --> 00:47:18,465
What's wrong?

658
00:47:18,465 --> 00:47:23,066
I'm about to present, and I feel like my stomach's churning.

659
00:47:23,066 --> 00:47:24,433
Like I need to poop. I'm going to the bathroom first.

660
00:47:24,433 --> 00:47:26,166
- Stop! Wait!
- Stop! Wait!

661
00:47:26,166 --> 00:47:30,266
Stay with us! Hold it in! Clench! Cut it off! Tighten!

662
00:47:30,266 --> 00:47:32,933
You're good at this!

663
00:47:34,333 --> 00:47:36,066
Hello…

664
00:47:41,033 --> 00:47:42,700
Everyone, did you notice anything strange?

665
00:47:42,700 --> 00:47:45,466
Strange! Totally strange! Why isn't the boss wearing a tie?

666
00:47:45,466 --> 00:47:47,066
And what's with Prim's face?

667
00:47:47,066 --> 00:47:50,048
She looks like something's off. The vibe is tense in here.

668
00:48:01,084 --> 00:48:03,933
So, how exactly do you want me to make it up to you?

669
00:48:03,933 --> 00:48:06,533
I'm not in the mood to say right now.

670
00:48:06,533 --> 00:48:09,426
And when will you be in the mood?

671
00:48:09,426 --> 00:48:11,419
I don't know.

672
00:48:11,419 --> 00:48:13,221
But not now.

673
00:48:28,466 --> 00:48:31,266
Hi, what are you doing?

674
00:48:31,266 --> 00:48:34,732
- We are working.
- We are working.

675
00:48:35,900 --> 00:48:38,966
She didn't even wait for an answer. Then why ask?

676
00:48:38,966 --> 00:48:41,100
Thi.

677
00:48:42,633 --> 00:48:43,700
Hi, Prim.

678
00:48:43,700 --> 00:48:44,966
Hello, Miss Jinny.

679
00:48:44,966 --> 00:48:49,873
Hi! I brought some snacks for both you and Thi.

680
00:48:49,873 --> 00:48:52,766
I didn't want to brag, but I'm going to anyway

681
00:48:52,766 --> 00:48:54,726
because I made them myself, and they're delicious!

682
00:48:54,726 --> 00:48:56,264
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

683
00:48:56,264 --> 00:49:00,847
Thi, this is yours.

684
00:49:00,847 --> 00:49:02,333
Thank you.

685
00:49:02,333 --> 00:49:06,700
Thi, do you know I have something new?

686
00:49:08,566 --> 00:49:11,100
What could it be?

687
00:49:11,100 --> 00:49:15,066
Can you guess? Sparkle, sparkle.

688
00:49:16,566 --> 00:49:18,866
You got your nails done?

689
00:49:18,866 --> 00:49:23,633
Oh my god, Thi! You guessed it right! Wow, you're sooo smart.

690
00:49:23,633 --> 00:49:26,933
Most guys are clueless,

691
00:49:27,733 --> 00:49:31,033
but you're brilliant!

692
00:49:31,033 --> 00:49:35,333
Since it's my birthday, I just wanted to try something new.

693
00:49:35,333 --> 00:49:39,033
I thought about buying myself some flowers

694
00:49:39,033 --> 00:49:42,066
since no one else will do it.

695
00:49:42,066 --> 00:49:44,333
So sad.

696
00:49:58,290 --> 00:50:00,233
I'm here to pick up the flowers I ordered, Ms. Fah.

697
00:50:00,233 --> 00:50:02,137
They're ready.

698
00:50:02,966 --> 00:50:04,766
Thank you so much.

699
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:18,700
Thank you, Thi.

700
00:50:18,700 --> 00:50:21,800
This has been such a Happy Birthday for me.

701
00:50:21,800 --> 00:50:25,500
Honestly, I didn't really want flowers.

702
00:50:26,166 --> 00:50:30,400
But since you bought them, I have to accept them.

703
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,233
So silly of me.

704
00:50:33,766 --> 00:50:35,500
So silly.

705
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:44,766
<i>It should've been obvious from the start.</i>

706
00:50:44,766 --> 00:50:47,033
- Yes.
- Because…

707
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,899
Are you free?

708
00:50:54,899 --> 00:50:57,300
- No, I'm not.
- But I am.

709
00:51:08,600 --> 00:51:11,633
There's nothing I'm more sure about than this.

710
00:51:21,656 --> 00:51:25,833
Then, I think I'll excuse myself.

711
00:51:29,540 --> 00:51:32,900
What? Why are you giving me flowers?

712
00:51:34,019 --> 00:51:36,579
Secretary Prim likes me.

713
00:51:37,566 --> 00:51:40,400
Today, I saw that she was upset when I gave flowers to Jinny.

714
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,100
That means she definitely likes me.

715
00:51:43,833 --> 00:51:46,033
How do you know that?

716
00:51:46,033 --> 00:51:49,100
I saw her crying with my own eyes today.

717
00:51:49,580 --> 00:51:51,533
<i>So silly of me.</i>

718
00:51:54,238 --> 00:51:55,966
<i>So silly.</i>

719
00:52:21,900 --> 00:52:24,433
Finally, I've figured out the truth.

720
00:52:24,433 --> 00:52:26,766
Even Secretary Prim...

721
00:52:27,333 --> 00:52:30,000
has fallen for my charm.

722
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,700
Man, your confidence is something else.

723
00:52:34,700 --> 00:52:38,666
No wonder she wouldn't tell me the real reason she was resigning.

724
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:41,033
She pretended it was about wanting her own life,

725
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:43,333
not wanting to be around me all day, every day.

726
00:52:43,333 --> 00:52:45,466
But the truth is...

727
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,500
she just didn't want to fall for me even more.

728
00:52:50,861 --> 00:52:54,600
What? That face. You don't believe me?

729
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:58,000
The one who's caught feelings is you.

730
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,500
You're totally obsessed with your secretary resigning.

731
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:02,100
What's wrong with you?

732
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:03,766
You've got it bad, man.

733
00:53:03,766 --> 00:53:05,566
What feelings? That's ridiculous.

734
00:53:05,566 --> 00:53:07,826
I don't have feelings like that.

735
00:53:07,826 --> 00:53:10,866
Prim likes me.

736
00:53:11,506 --> 00:53:13,508
Actually,

737
00:53:13,508 --> 00:53:16,366
maybe she's already in love with me.

738
00:53:18,733 --> 00:53:20,533
This is crazy!

739
00:53:23,147 --> 00:53:25,066
It's crazy all right!

740
00:53:27,923 --> 00:53:31,100
Prim, here's some allergy medicine.

741
00:53:31,100 --> 00:53:32,592
Thank you.

742
00:53:32,592 --> 00:53:36,500
And what are you even allergic to? Why are you like this?

743
00:53:36,500 --> 00:53:38,866
Pollen from flowers.

744
00:53:38,866 --> 00:53:41,433
What kind of hellish flowers are those?

745
00:53:41,433 --> 00:53:48,100
<i>♪ Lun-lan-la, lun-lan-la ♪</i> I told you I didn't want them. So silly!

746
00:53:50,800 --> 00:53:52,266
There's the hell right there.

747
00:53:52,266 --> 00:53:55,237
<i>♪ Lun-lan-la ♪</i> I forgot something!

748
00:53:56,300 --> 00:53:59,066
One more and I'm sweeping your legs out from under you!

749
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:07,166
Can you double-check the VIP seating again?

750
00:54:07,166 --> 00:54:09,266
We might need to add extra seats for their companions.

751
00:54:09,266 --> 00:54:11,633
- Okay, got it.
- Thank you!

752
00:54:13,111 --> 00:54:14,711
Boss!

753
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:17,070
How is everything? Is the event okay?

754
00:54:17,070 --> 00:54:19,460
Anything you'd like us to change, Boss?

755
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:22,100
Everything is good already. Perfect!

756
00:54:23,733 --> 00:54:26,800
Thank you, everyone, for taking the time to help out today.

757
00:54:26,800 --> 00:54:29,413
You can go take a break now. Make sure to get dressed up nicely.

758
00:54:29,413 --> 00:54:31,500
Looking fabulous is a must, of course.

759
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,833
- Absolutely!
- Thank you, Boss.

760
00:54:44,133 --> 00:54:45,900
Aren't you going to dress up?

761
00:54:45,900 --> 00:54:49,766
Tonight, my secretary has to shine just as brightly as I do.

762
00:54:49,766 --> 00:54:54,011
Let me recheck the stage, then I'll change my outfit.

763
00:54:54,011 --> 00:54:57,966
I never knew your event organizing skills were this professional.

764
00:54:57,966 --> 00:55:00,866
You could start your own company with these skills!

765
00:55:02,100 --> 00:55:05,766
I haven't thought about what I want to do next yet.

766
00:55:09,033 --> 00:55:12,700
I want to find something I truly enjoy,

767
00:55:12,700 --> 00:55:15,166
and go on a date with someone.

768
00:55:21,397 --> 00:55:22,997
A date!

769
00:55:23,500 --> 00:55:26,900
Yes, one day I will have a family.

770
00:55:26,900 --> 00:55:31,633
If I meet the right person, I might even get married.

771
00:55:33,566 --> 00:55:37,054
But the other day, when I saw you, I thought you were in love with…

772
00:55:37,054 --> 00:55:39,170
What do you mean?

773
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:43,190
Never mind. Forget about it.

774
00:55:45,166 --> 00:55:47,666
All right, I understand you now.

775
00:55:47,666 --> 00:55:51,833
Your life should be yours. I won't hold you back anymore.

776
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:57,800
Feel free to announce the search for a new secretary.

777
00:56:13,100 --> 00:56:14,533
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

778
00:56:14,533 --> 00:56:16,333
How long have you stayed in Thailand?

779
00:56:16,333 --> 00:56:18,166
A couple of years.

780
00:56:18,700 --> 00:56:20,900
Everyone, a big smile, please.

781
00:56:30,966 --> 00:56:32,200
- Hello.
- Thank you for coming.

782
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,166
My pleasure, nice to meet you.

783
00:56:34,166 --> 00:56:36,131
Okay, I'm going to have to greet my friends.

784
00:56:36,131 --> 00:56:38,466
- Okay, take your time.
- Thanks.

785
00:57:11,233 --> 00:57:13,433
Is something wrong, Boss?

786
00:57:15,691 --> 00:57:17,291
No.

787
00:57:18,303 --> 00:57:21,100
Are all the VIP guests here yet?

788
00:57:21,100 --> 00:57:24,866
Yes, they're all here. Mr. Li Tang is especially eager to meet you.

789
00:57:29,166 --> 00:57:32,200
Next year, I'll go explore opportunities in Beijing.

790
00:57:32,200 --> 00:57:34,600
I'd like to open a new branch there.

791
00:57:34,600 --> 00:57:38,433
That's wonderful. China will always be happy to welcome you.

792
00:57:38,433 --> 00:57:42,033
Tomorrow, we've arranged a dinner cruise

793
00:57:42,033 --> 00:57:46,448
on the Chao Phraya River for you and your wife.

794
00:57:47,275 --> 00:57:49,133
Thank you so much, Ms. Prim.

795
00:57:49,133 --> 00:57:50,866
You really know my wife well.

796
00:57:50,866 --> 00:57:53,887
She's been wanting to go on a river cruise for a long time.

797
00:57:54,566 --> 00:57:56,533
I love the suite room very much.

798
00:57:56,533 --> 00:58:00,033
Thanks to your wife for managing this for me.

799
00:58:00,033 --> 00:58:03,366
Actually, she is my secretary, not my wife.

800
00:58:04,123 --> 00:58:07,100
I made a fool of myself.

801
00:58:07,100 --> 00:58:10,266
I've done more embarrassing things than you.

802
00:58:10,266 --> 00:58:11,810
Sorry.

803
00:58:12,433 --> 00:58:16,733
All right, everyone, it's almost time to count down to the New Year!

804
00:58:16,733 --> 00:58:20,766
Is everyone ready to count down?

805
00:58:26,233 --> 00:58:29,066
Boss, you should go to the fireworks viewing spot.

806
00:58:29,066 --> 00:58:30,910
Come with me.

807
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:35,100
You never stay for the countdown with me.

808
00:58:35,100 --> 00:58:37,133
But this year,

809
00:58:37,566 --> 00:58:39,533
you have to stay.

810
00:58:44,866 --> 00:58:47,164
Okay, guys, cheers!

811
00:58:48,033 --> 00:58:49,666
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

812
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:53,200
All right then, let's count down together!

813
00:58:53,200 --> 00:58:56,833
Boss, can I check on things first?

814
00:58:56,833 --> 00:59:00,333
There are plenty of staff for that. You don't need to worry anymore.

815
00:59:00,333 --> 00:59:02,300
Stay here with me.

816
00:59:03,748 --> 00:59:05,248

I'm really sorry, Boss.

<i>Just take care of Ploen for one day.</i>

838
01:01:23,851 --> 01:01:25,780
<i>But I have to find a new secretary for the boss.</i>

839
01:01:25,780 --> 01:01:28,170
<i>How can I look after her?</i>

840
01:01:29,618 --> 01:01:32,336
<i>What is it like to be a good secretary?</i>

841
01:01:32,336 --> 01:01:34,378
<i>You have to take care of your valuables as best you can.</i>

842
01:01:34,378 --> 01:01:38,057
<i>And for the secretary, the most valuable thing is him.</i>

843
01:01:38,706 --> 01:01:40,032
<i>I will let you redeem yourself</i>

844
01:01:40,032 --> 01:01:42,854
<i>by training your assistant secretary to pass the probation.</i>

845
01:01:42,854 --> 01:01:46,281
<i>Then I will allow you to resign.</i>
