1
00:01:05,123 --> 00:01:07,215
I've already decided
not to extend your probation period.

2
00:01:07,215 --> 00:01:09,723
I'll hire you as a permanent employee
in the position of Assistant Secretary,

3
00:01:09,723 --> 00:01:10,727
Huh?

4
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:12,205
How did you get here, sir?

5
00:01:12,205 --> 00:01:14,010
I took a day off to come here with my family.

6
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,977
I wanted to come
and get to know your family better,

7
00:01:16,977 --> 00:01:18,642
so they can stop worrying
about us being together

8
00:01:18,642 --> 00:01:21,562
and finally accept me as their son-in-law.

9
00:01:21,562 --> 00:01:24,706
Well, I'll give you a chance then.

10
00:01:24,706 --> 00:01:28,096
Tham. Listen to
what I'm going to tell you carefully.

11
00:01:28,096 --> 00:01:31,659
It was Thee who was kidnapped.

12
00:01:31,659 --> 00:01:32,694
It's not you.

13
00:01:32,694 --> 00:01:33,965
You know about this, don't you?

14
00:01:35,094 --> 00:01:36,629
I remember now. That woman.

15
00:01:38,219 --> 00:01:39,389
Prim!

16
00:01:39,389 --> 00:01:40,599
Can you hear me, Prim?

17
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:41,849
Prim.

18
00:01:41,849 --> 00:01:43,749
You brought that up with Prim again,
didn't you?

19
00:01:43,749 --> 00:01:45,250
So that's why she passed out?

20
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:48,412
When will you stop causing trouble
for everyone around you, huh?

21
00:01:50,829 --> 00:01:54,692
Everything's chaotic because
you kept hiding the truth, isn't it?

22
00:01:55,994 --> 00:01:57,367
The one who was taken was you.

23
00:01:57,969 --> 00:01:59,606
The one who was locked up that day…

24
00:01:59,606 --> 00:02:01,953
It wasn't me, it was you.

25
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:14,340
You didn't lose your memory, right?

26
00:02:15,853 --> 00:02:17,410
You remember everything, don't you?

27
00:02:19,534 --> 00:02:20,647
Why are you so quiet?

28
00:02:21,294 --> 00:02:24,526
No wonder I couldn't remember anything
from back then.

29
00:02:27,176 --> 00:02:29,029
Don't you feel even a little guilty?

30
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:32,058
That I've had to suffer all this time
just because I wasn't that child

31
00:02:32,058 --> 00:02:33,363
while it was you all along!

32
00:02:36,795 --> 00:02:40,339
You must find it so funny
seeing me acting crazy all by myself.

33
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:42,660
<i>Knock, knock.</i>

34
00:03:46,104 --> 00:03:48,114
<i>Why are you sitting here alone?</i>

35
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:53,594
<i>I want to visit mom at the hospital,
but dad won't let me.</i>

36
00:03:53,594 --> 00:03:56,965
<i>I want to see mom,
but I don't know how to get there.</i>

37
00:03:59,798 --> 00:04:03,146
<i>Well… how about I take you there?</i>

38
00:04:04,201 --> 00:04:06,045
<i>Do you know my mom?</i>

39
00:04:06,718 --> 00:04:07,722
<i>Of course, I do.</i>

40
00:04:09,377 --> 00:04:11,783
<i>Come on, come with me.</i>

41
00:04:18,701 --> 00:04:21,900
<i>I'll take you to see your mom, and then…</i>

42
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:24,148
<i>we go and have some delicious snacks together?</i>

43
00:04:25,457 --> 00:04:26,470
<i>How about that?</i>

44
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:40,627
You've always wanted to know
what really happened that day?

45
00:04:43,159 --> 00:04:46,740
I'm sorry that
I never thought of telling you before.

46
00:04:49,077 --> 00:04:51,260
But today, I'll tell you everything.

47
00:04:53,703 --> 00:04:56,939
If it could just make you wake up
and talk to me again.

48
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:01,256
Please, Prim.

49
00:05:33,355 --> 00:05:36,333
<i>Oh, why are you making that face, sweetie?</i>

50
00:05:37,822 --> 00:05:39,713
<i>Mommy brought your little girl to stay with us.</i>

51
00:05:40,920 --> 00:05:41,920
<i>Aren't you happy?</i>

52
00:05:43,700 --> 00:05:46,471
<i>Mom isn't here. You're lying.</i>

53
00:05:46,471 --> 00:05:48,072
<i>I want to go home!</i>

54
00:05:48,072 --> 00:05:50,806
<i>Hey, where do you think you're going?</i>

55
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:52,172
<i>You're not going anywhere.</i>

56
00:05:52,172 --> 00:05:54,381
<i>You're my child! You have to stay here with me!</i>

57
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:05,976
<i>You're my child,</i>

58
00:06:08,305 --> 00:06:09,822
<i>you have to learn to be a good kid.</i>

59
00:06:10,894 --> 00:06:13,322
<i>Because if you're stubborn like your brother,</i>

60
00:06:15,134 --> 00:06:18,692
<i>you'll get tied up just like him!</i>

61
00:06:22,259 --> 00:06:23,259
<i>Just be quiet.</i>

62
00:06:36,486 --> 00:06:39,453
That day, you told me your mother was dying.

63
00:06:42,749 --> 00:06:45,928
So I didn't want you to see
what death really looks like.

64
00:06:58,060 --> 00:06:59,564
<i>Don't cry.</i>

65
00:07:00,606 --> 00:07:03,061
<i>I'm scared.</i>

66
00:07:03,061 --> 00:07:06,760
<i>I want to see my mom at the hospital…</i>

67
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,595
<i>Is your mom in the hospital?</i>

68
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:12,659
<i>Yes, I overheard my dad telling Pear that</i>

69
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:15,830
<i>mom is very sick and she's dying.</i>

70
00:07:15,830 --> 00:07:17,008
<i>Dying?</i>

71
00:07:18,027 --> 00:07:19,675
<i>What does dying mean?</i>

72
00:07:19,675 --> 00:07:23,763
<i>Why is dad sad? He won't tell me anything.</i>

73
00:07:23,763 --> 00:07:29,002
<i>Your dad is sad because if someone dies,
you'll never see them again.</i>

74
00:07:29,002 --> 00:07:32,241
<i>Does that mean I'll never see mom again?</i>

75
00:07:33,169 --> 00:07:35,753
<i>Forget about that for now.</i>

76
00:07:36,799 --> 00:07:39,248
<i>I'll give you some yummy snacks, okay?</i>

77
00:07:58,635 --> 00:07:59,762
<i>Is it good?</i>

78
00:08:04,138 --> 00:08:06,592
<i>Don't cry. Don't make noise.</i>

79
00:08:06,592 --> 00:08:09,798
<i>That aunt will get mad and hurt us, understand?</i>

80
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:15,290
<i>In here, we have to endure.</i>

81
00:08:15,290 --> 00:08:17,366
<i>I'm trying to find a way out.</i>

82
00:08:17,366 --> 00:08:19,598
<i>We'll get out together, okay?</i>

83
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:24,588
<i>You're so strong
for not crying like me, Prince.</i>

84
00:08:37,232 --> 00:08:39,315
<i>You're all just as evil!</i>

85
00:08:41,226 --> 00:08:42,513
<i>You hurt me!</i>

86
00:08:42,513 --> 00:08:44,162
<i>You won't let me see my child!</i>

87
00:08:44,162 --> 00:08:45,701
<i>I want to see my child! My child is mine!</i>

88
00:08:45,701 --> 00:08:49,003
<i>Do you understand that my child is mine?
Give my child back to me!</i>

89
00:08:50,902 --> 00:08:52,136
<i>Don't be scared.</i>

90
00:08:52,875 --> 00:08:54,405
<i>That aunt is outside.</i>

91
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:56,618
<i>Don't listen to her, and don't pay attention.</i>

92
00:08:57,220 --> 00:08:58,967
<i>I'll sing for you, okay?</i>

93
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:08,451
<i>♪ Sleep tight, my darling ♪</i>

94
00:09:08,451 --> 00:09:13,529
<i>♪ Sleep tight, sweet dreams ♪</i>

95
00:09:13,529 --> 00:09:18,629
<i>♪ The sky is full of stars just for you ♪</i>

96
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:24,809
<i>♪ I'll always be here for you ♪</i>

97
00:09:24,809 --> 00:09:29,841
<i>♪ La la la la la, la la, ♪</i>

98
00:09:30,714 --> 00:09:36,010
<i>♪ La la la la la, la la ♪</i>

99
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:41,360
<i>♪ I'll always be close to you ♪</i>

100
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,486
<i>♪ I'll always hold you tight ♪</i>

101
00:09:49,829 --> 00:09:51,748
<i>I was a fool.</i>

102
00:09:51,748 --> 00:09:54,339
<i>I was stupid for believing anything you said.</i>

103
00:09:54,339 --> 00:09:56,632
<i>I was stupid for agreeing to be your mistress.</i>

104
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:01,834
<i>And you still let your old wife
take my child away from me!</i>

105
00:10:02,496 --> 00:10:05,643
<i>Darling, that child is ours!</i>

106
00:10:05,643 --> 00:10:07,083
<i>He's my son, do you hear me?</i>

107
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:08,368
<i>He's mine!</i>

108
00:10:10,622 --> 00:10:13,959
<i>Go tell them to give my child back, will you?</i>

109
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:16,947
<i>Stop! I told you to stop talking, you bastard!</i>

110
00:10:16,947 --> 00:10:19,294
<i>You're going to take me to the hospital?</i>

111
00:10:19,294 --> 00:10:20,649
<i>I'm not sick!</i>

112
00:10:20,649 --> 00:10:22,872
<i>I'm not crazy! Do you hear me?</i>

113
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,160
<i>I'm not crazy!</i>

114
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:38,116
<i>See?</i>

115
00:10:40,736 --> 00:10:42,851
<i>You see that your father doesn't love us?</i>

116
00:10:45,408 --> 00:10:47,026
<i>He doesn't even care about us.</i>

117
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:53,830
<i>But I love him.</i>

118
00:10:57,931 --> 00:10:59,597
<i>I love him…</i>

119
00:10:59,597 --> 00:11:02,194
<i>And I love him so much.</i>

120
00:11:05,004 --> 00:11:06,618
<i>I just want to know…</i>

121
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:11,043
<i>If I die…</i>

122
00:11:12,709 --> 00:11:14,171
<i>will he feel guilty?</i>

123
00:11:22,997 --> 00:11:24,296
<i>Right…</i>

124
00:11:24,296 --> 00:11:25,783
<i>It has to be big news.</i>

125
00:11:26,777 --> 00:11:28,394
<i>If there's enough spotlight on it,</i>

126
00:11:29,931 --> 00:11:31,622
<i>everyone's going to find out.</i>

127
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:50,114
<i>Alright.</i>

128
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:52,966
<i>We'll die together, all three of us!</i>

129
00:11:55,681 --> 00:11:57,005
<i>Then it'll be all over the news.</i>

130
00:11:58,771 --> 00:12:01,128
<i>Who should die first?</i>

131
00:12:17,814 --> 00:12:20,621
<i>Prim, close your eyes! Close your eyes!</i>

132
00:12:24,153 --> 00:12:27,705
<i>Auntie, please don't do this.</i>

133
00:12:28,409 --> 00:12:30,389
<i>Please let us go.</i>

134
00:12:30,389 --> 00:12:33,302
<i>I promise I won't tell the police!</i>

135
00:12:33,302 --> 00:12:35,896
<i>Please, I'm begging you!</i>

136
00:12:35,896 --> 00:12:37,320
<i>Or else…</i>

137
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,525
<i>Just let her go.</i>

138
00:12:39,525 --> 00:12:41,859
<i>Keep me instead.</i>

139
00:12:41,859 --> 00:12:44,940
<i>I'll stay with you, Auntie!</i>

140
00:13:00,489 --> 00:13:03,026
<i>I… What have I done…</i>

141
00:13:03,026 --> 00:13:05,496
<i>What have I done…</i>

142
00:13:05,496 --> 00:13:06,498
<i>I'm…</i>

143
00:13:07,296 --> 00:13:09,015
<i>I'm sorry. I…</i>

144
00:13:09,015 --> 00:13:11,081
<i>I didn't mean to. I didn't…</i>

145
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:13,886
<i>I didn't mean to take you two…</i>

146
00:13:16,685 --> 00:13:19,008
<i>I didn't mean to.</i>

147
00:13:19,008 --> 00:13:22,261
<i>It's okay, it's okay…</i>

148
00:13:22,261 --> 00:13:25,016
<i>You're going to let us go, right?</i>

149
00:13:25,016 --> 00:13:28,196
<i>You're not going to
kill yourself anymore, right?</i>

150
00:13:38,081 --> 00:13:42,181
<i>I think I've come too far to turn back now.</i>

151
00:13:45,443 --> 00:13:47,692
<i>Let me spend my last moments</i>

152
00:13:50,591 --> 00:13:52,671
<i>with you instead of him.</i>

153
00:13:52,671 --> 00:13:54,565
<i>No, please don't!</i>

154
00:13:54,565 --> 00:13:56,569
<i>Don't do that, please!</i>

155
00:13:56,569 --> 00:13:59,355
<i>Somebody help!</i>

156
00:13:59,355 --> 00:14:00,699
<i>Help!</i>

157
00:14:00,699 --> 00:14:02,497
<i>Auntie, please don't!</i>

158
00:14:03,326 --> 00:14:04,669
<i>Be a good kid, okay?</i>

159
00:14:04,669 --> 00:14:07,471
<i>Auntie, please don't do that!</i>

160
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:09,905
<i>- Please don't, Auntie!
- Take care of your little sister, okay?</i>

161
00:14:09,905 --> 00:14:12,334
<i>Don't do it! Don't!</i>

162
00:14:17,943 --> 00:14:20,027
<i>What happened to her?</i>

163
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:22,363
<i>Nothing.</i>

164
00:14:22,363 --> 00:14:24,921
<i>She's just… asleep.</i>

165
00:14:26,296 --> 00:14:27,882
<i>I'm scared…</i>

166
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:31,084
<i>If you're scared, just close your eyes, okay?</i>

167
00:14:34,176 --> 00:14:36,418
<i>Stay here, I'll be right back.</i>

168
00:15:03,255 --> 00:15:04,285
<i>I'm back now.</i>

169
00:15:13,278 --> 00:15:15,486
<i>I'll get us out of here,</i>

170
00:15:15,486 --> 00:15:17,963
<i>but you have to close your eyes, okay?</i>

171
00:15:46,064 --> 00:15:47,519
<i>Is this your house?</i>

172
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:48,880
<i>Yes, it is.</i>

173
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:52,051
<i>From now on,
don't follow strangers anymore, okay?</i>

174
00:15:54,362 --> 00:15:56,386
<i>You have to come back for me,</i>

175
00:15:56,386 --> 00:15:59,642
<i>If you come back, I'll marry you!</i>

176
00:15:59,642 --> 00:16:02,823
<i>Marry me? You can't do that…</i>

177
00:16:02,823 --> 00:16:04,356
<i>Why not?</i>

178
00:16:04,356 --> 00:16:09,368
<i>Because when you grow up,
you'll marry someone you love.</i>

179
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:12,697
<i>Then if you grow up,
you must come back to love me.</i>

180
00:16:12,697 --> 00:16:14,017
<i>So we can get married!</i>

181
00:16:14,017 --> 00:16:15,230
<i>Promise me, okay?</i>

182
00:16:16,017 --> 00:16:18,230
<i>Okay, let's make a promise.</i>

183
00:16:21,098 --> 00:16:22,102
<i>I have to go now.</i>

184
00:16:27,089 --> 00:16:28,089
<i>Prim!</i>

185
00:16:31,999 --> 00:16:34,003
<i>Dad! She's back!</i>

186
00:16:34,985 --> 00:16:35,985
<i>Prim!</i>

187
00:16:43,362 --> 00:16:44,617
<i>Where have you been, dear?</i>

188
00:16:46,075 --> 00:16:47,552
<i>I was so worried about you.</i>

189
00:16:47,552 --> 00:16:49,547
<i>I wanted to see mom…</i>

190
00:17:07,098 --> 00:17:08,101
<i>Let's go.</i>

191
00:17:08,101 --> 00:17:11,101
<i>Pear, take her to the shower.</i>

192
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:34,316
<i>Huh? Where did this kid come from?</i>

193
00:17:34,316 --> 00:17:35,634
<i>What are you running from, kid?</i>

194
00:17:38,255 --> 00:17:39,562
<i>Hey!</i>

195
00:17:44,533 --> 00:17:46,822
And I wanted to know how you were doing,

196
00:17:48,062 --> 00:17:51,405
so I asked my mom to take me to your house.

197
00:17:55,330 --> 00:17:56,934
But when I got there…

198
00:17:59,054 --> 00:18:00,391
You weren't there anymore.

199
00:18:01,768 --> 00:18:03,361
I was too late…

200
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:15,766
<i>She's not here anymore?</i>

201
00:18:15,766 --> 00:18:18,520
<i>I promised her that…</i>

202
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,336
<i>I would come back for her.</i>

203
00:18:32,105 --> 00:18:33,870
After the incident at the abandoned house,

204
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:36,700
I could never live like a normal person again.

205
00:18:37,522 --> 00:18:40,002
<i>Don't shoot me!
I don't want to die! Please don't!</i>

206
00:18:40,002 --> 00:18:42,210
<i>- Tham!
- Tham! What's wrong, son?</i>

207
00:18:42,210 --> 00:18:44,290
<i>- Tham!
- Nurse! Nurse, please!</i>

208
00:18:44,290 --> 00:18:45,873
<i>Tham, you're okay now.</i>

209
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:46,994
<i>I'm here, son.</i>

210
00:18:46,994 --> 00:18:49,084
<i>Tham, Tham!</i>

211
00:18:49,084 --> 00:18:50,960
<i>Mom's here, Tham.</i>

212
00:18:53,918 --> 00:18:56,556
I developed a sudden fear of the dark.

213
00:18:59,822 --> 00:19:01,811
<i>- Thee, Thee!
- Don't shoot me!</i>

214
00:19:01,811 --> 00:19:03,705
<i>- Don't hurt me! I'm scared!
- What's wrong, son?</i>

215
00:19:03,705 --> 00:19:05,080
I'm scared of cable ties…

216
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:06,080
<i>Take them away!</i>

217
00:19:06,862 --> 00:19:08,368
<i>Someone take them away!</i>

218
00:19:08,368 --> 00:19:10,509
<i>Please, help! Somebody help!</i>

219
00:19:10,509 --> 00:19:11,526
<i>Help!</i>

220
00:19:12,970 --> 00:19:15,771
Every time I thought of you, I kept wondering…

221
00:19:16,850 --> 00:19:19,121
Were you scared of the same things as me?

222
00:19:22,913 --> 00:19:24,097
Until one day…

223
00:19:25,402 --> 00:19:27,185
I saw you again.

224
00:19:30,130 --> 00:19:34,263
<i>Welcome to our company, new secretary!</i>

225
00:19:37,147 --> 00:19:41,016
<i>Please take good care of me.
If there's anything, please help teach me.</i>

226
00:19:41,977 --> 00:19:43,291
<i>Congratulations!</i>

227
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,599
<i>If you need anything, feel free to ask me.</i>

228
00:20:05,329 --> 00:20:08,021
<i>The contract went really well.
Mr. Peter loves it, Dad.</i>

229
00:20:08,021 --> 00:20:09,874
<i>I'll arrange the meeting as soon as possible.</i>

230
00:20:10,956 --> 00:20:11,956
<i>Alright.</i>

231
00:20:14,390 --> 00:20:17,770
<i>Hello, Chairman. Hello, Director.</i>

232
00:20:18,690 --> 00:20:21,865
<i>I'm Prim, Primala Rattanapanan,
the assistant secretary to the Director.</i>

233
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:32,781
<i>You remember me, right?</i>

234
00:20:35,101 --> 00:20:38,695
<i>Of course! You're the Chairman's son.</i>

235
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:45,606
<i>Did I say something wrong?</i>

236
00:20:47,742 --> 00:20:49,755
<i>You're right. You remembered correctly.</i>

237
00:20:50,495 --> 00:20:51,892
<i>It's nice to work with you.</i>

238
00:20:52,807 --> 00:20:55,133
But you don't remember your prince…

239
00:20:56,206 --> 00:20:59,311
<i>Thank you so much,
Mr. Thee, for giving me this opportunity.</i>

240
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:00,811
<i>I'm really happy!</i>

241
00:21:00,811 --> 00:21:04,477
<i>I promise I'll do my best at this job.</i>

242
00:21:07,094 --> 00:21:11,406
<i>I don't need the best work. I need…</i>

243
00:21:11,406 --> 00:21:12,511
<i>Perfect work.</i>

244
00:21:14,530 --> 00:21:16,129
<i>All right, perfect!</i>

245
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,186
Even though I'm disappointed,
I'm also relieved…

246
00:21:20,860 --> 00:21:23,925
That you don't have to suffer
from bad memories like I do.

247
00:21:25,756 --> 00:21:27,524
But no matter what you're like now,

248
00:21:28,994 --> 00:21:31,364
I feel like God has done us a favor…

249
00:21:32,595 --> 00:21:35,115
Sending you to be by my side once again.

250
00:21:36,952 --> 00:21:40,520
<i>Being the Director's secretary,
you need to be fluent in English too!</i>

251
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:43,132
<i>This kind of miscommunication
and poor writing is unacceptable.</i>

252
00:21:43,132 --> 00:21:44,310
<i>It'll ruin the entire work!</i>

253
00:21:45,383 --> 00:21:47,860
<i>How did HR even hire someone like you?</i>

254
00:21:53,936 --> 00:21:55,524
<i>Director, did you request to see me?</i>

255
00:21:56,222 --> 00:21:57,222
<i>Sit down.</i>

256
00:22:01,010 --> 00:22:02,889
<i>Here, take this book.</i>

257
00:22:02,889 --> 00:22:05,784
<i>It's perfect for people working in a company.</i>

258
00:22:05,784 --> 00:22:07,624
<i>It has a lot of business vocabulary
and is easy to understand.</i>

259
00:22:07,624 --> 00:22:10,604
<i>Read it and try to remember 30 pages a day.</i>

260
00:22:10,604 --> 00:22:12,751
<i>I'll test you every day after work.</i>

261
00:22:14,081 --> 00:22:16,524
<i>You'll test me every day?</i>

262
00:22:16,524 --> 00:22:17,925
<i>Yes, every day.</i>

263
00:22:22,858 --> 00:22:28,858
<i>I will send your comment to…</i>

264
00:22:29,952 --> 00:22:32,284
<i>to legal team…</i>

265
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:37,213
<i>I will send your comment to legal team…</i>

266
00:22:37,213 --> 00:22:38,740
<i>And…</i>

267
00:22:41,617 --> 00:22:44,273
<i>I told you I can't do it.
It's not going to work!</i>

268
00:22:44,273 --> 00:22:46,170
<i>But you're still forcing me.</i>

269
00:22:46,170 --> 00:22:47,687
<i>You don't understand, do you?</i>

270
00:22:47,687 --> 00:22:50,609
<i>You're so cruel. Do you know how hard it is?</i>

271
00:22:50,609 --> 00:22:54,250
<i>I can't do it,
I've already told you I can't do it.</i>

272
00:22:54,250 --> 00:22:56,311
<i>I will send your comment to legal team</i>

273
00:22:56,311 --> 00:22:59,277
<i>and draft a contract for you
via email by this Friday.</i>

274
00:23:00,709 --> 00:23:01,760
<i>It's not perfect.</i>

275
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:03,722
<i>Your accent isn't perfect.</i>

276
00:23:04,936 --> 00:23:06,304
<i>But it's understandable, I'll give you a pass.</i>

277
00:23:06,304 --> 00:23:07,304
<i>Yay!</i>

278
00:23:09,210 --> 00:23:10,210
<i>Sorry!</i>

279
00:23:11,090 --> 00:23:13,249
<i>I have a gift for you,
for passing all the tests.</i>

280
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:18,120
<i>Here.</i>

281
00:23:18,120 --> 00:23:19,120
<i>Thank you!</i>

282
00:23:19,779 --> 00:23:22,733
<i>You're the first employee
to receive a gift from me,</i>

283
00:23:22,733 --> 00:23:24,080
<i>so be proud of it.</i>

284
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,517
<i>Thank you.</i>

285
00:23:26,517 --> 00:23:29,001
<i>What gift did you get me, Director?</i>

286
00:23:29,001 --> 00:23:30,049
<i>Open it and see.</i>

287
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:38,549
<i>Working here, especially working with me,
you need to be good at multiple languages.</i>

288
00:23:38,549 --> 00:23:40,675
<i>Keep going, you can do it!</i>

289
00:23:54,390 --> 00:23:55,903
<i>May I ask what this meeting is about?</i>

290
00:23:57,115 --> 00:24:01,022
<i>Congratulations, Director,
on your promotion to Executive Vice President.</i>

291
00:24:04,085 --> 00:24:05,483
<i>This is a gift from Prim.</i>

292
00:24:06,703 --> 00:24:07,703
<i>A gift?</i>

293
00:24:14,689 --> 00:24:15,735
<i>What kind of gift?</i>

294
00:24:16,700 --> 00:24:20,223
<i>Director, I mean, Boss, please open it and see.</i>

295
00:24:25,774 --> 00:24:27,614
<i>How to become a CEO…</i>

296
00:24:30,975 --> 00:24:32,079
<i>I was just kidding.</i>

297
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:35,816
<i>This is the real gift.</i>

298
00:24:38,022 --> 00:24:39,028
<i>What is it?</i>

299
00:24:40,038 --> 00:24:41,303
<i>I noticed Director…</i>

300
00:24:42,298 --> 00:24:44,584
<i>Boss always has a serious face,</i>

301
00:24:44,584 --> 00:24:47,260
<i>so this will help you relax
when you squeeze it.</i>

302
00:24:54,189 --> 00:24:57,192
<i>Something nonsense like this
doesn't seem suitable for someone cool like me.</i>

303
00:24:58,609 --> 00:25:00,175
<i>I'll take it back then.</i>

304
00:25:00,175 --> 00:25:03,366
<i>But since it's from your good intentions,
I'll accept it.</i>

305
00:25:23,099 --> 00:25:24,539
Then I thought…

306
00:25:25,743 --> 00:25:27,804
We'd work together forever.

307
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:32,097
Then one day, you told me you wanted to resign.

308
00:25:35,336 --> 00:25:37,331
The day I would truly lose you.

309
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:41,070
It made me realize that…

310
00:25:43,923 --> 00:25:45,404
I can't let you go.

311
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,925
You're the only woman
in my heart all along, Prim.

312
00:25:54,928 --> 00:25:56,210
Do you hear me?

313
00:25:59,029 --> 00:26:00,873
How much I love you.

314
00:26:18,484 --> 00:26:20,429
Prim, Prim!

315
00:26:23,855 --> 00:26:24,923
How are you feeling?

316
00:26:27,676 --> 00:26:28,853
Actually…

317
00:26:29,829 --> 00:26:33,495
You remember everything from the past, right?

318
00:26:37,551 --> 00:26:39,537
I remember everything now,

319
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:42,834
both the events of that day

320
00:26:44,129 --> 00:26:45,902
and that woman.

321
00:26:46,768 --> 00:26:47,768
And…

322
00:26:50,363 --> 00:26:51,747
My prince.

323
00:27:00,273 --> 00:27:01,273
Thank you…

324
00:27:02,466 --> 00:27:04,694
for always protecting and taking care of me.

325
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,997
Even though you were scared that day too.

326
00:27:17,645 --> 00:27:20,236
I thought I could keep this from you
longer than this.

327
00:27:21,210 --> 00:27:24,240
Then why did you have to
hide the truth from me?

328
00:27:27,253 --> 00:27:28,927
Do you remember what I told you?

329
00:27:30,197 --> 00:27:31,564
The Big Bang's bones?

330
00:27:33,778 --> 00:27:36,447
It's buried, and we shouldn't dig it up.

331
00:27:38,582 --> 00:27:42,208
It's like bad memories.
We shouldn't dig them up.

332
00:27:46,597 --> 00:27:48,108
I didn't want you…

333
00:27:49,977 --> 00:27:51,809
to feel the pain like I did.

334
00:27:54,954 --> 00:27:57,976
These things are too cruel for both of us.

335
00:28:02,114 --> 00:28:05,272
I've never forgotten that day,
not a single day.

336
00:28:07,853 --> 00:28:09,521
Every time I close my eyes,

337
00:28:10,503 --> 00:28:12,118
what I hear…

338
00:28:12,118 --> 00:28:13,363
what I see…

339
00:28:14,888 --> 00:28:16,218
It's so clear.

340
00:28:17,716 --> 00:28:19,394
Just like it happened yesterday.

341
00:28:23,222 --> 00:28:25,001
I didn't want you to be like me.

342
00:28:27,556 --> 00:28:30,253
But one day, I would have to remember anyway.

343
00:28:32,783 --> 00:28:35,194
I just wanted to delay it as much as possible.

344
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:39,093
I'm sorry.

345
00:28:39,769 --> 00:28:44,461
For letting you suffer alone
with those memories.

346
00:28:48,328 --> 00:28:49,700
It's okay.

347
00:28:49,700 --> 00:28:50,708
I can endure it.

348
00:28:54,050 --> 00:28:55,832
But from now on, can you promise me?

349
00:28:56,574 --> 00:28:59,585
That you won't keep anything from me again.

350
00:29:03,501 --> 00:29:07,347
I want to share
both happiness and pain with you.

351
00:29:18,910 --> 00:29:19,910
Okay.

352
00:29:21,089 --> 00:29:22,089
I promise.

353
00:29:33,618 --> 00:29:37,152
Calm down, son, calm down.

354
00:29:38,697 --> 00:29:40,550
Why did you only tell me the truth now?

355
00:29:41,252 --> 00:29:43,265
Why did you let me live with a lie?

356
00:29:43,869 --> 00:29:46,315
You made me look like a fool
in front of others.

357
00:29:46,315 --> 00:29:49,098
- It's my…
- The reason I am like this is because of you.

358
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:52,729
I'm sorry, dear. I'm really sorry.

359
00:29:55,788 --> 00:29:58,469
Look at me, I turned into a laughingstock…

360
00:29:58,469 --> 00:30:00,022
that Thee would laugh at.

361
00:30:00,668 --> 00:30:02,421
Thee wouldn't laugh at you

362
00:30:02,421 --> 00:30:04,342
because he didn't know about this.

363
00:30:04,342 --> 00:30:06,905
Thee doesn't remember anything either,
just like you.

364
00:30:07,665 --> 00:30:08,900
He doesn't remember?

365
00:30:10,168 --> 00:30:11,834
Thee doesn't have amnesia.

366
00:30:12,673 --> 00:30:14,316
Thee remembers everything,

367
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:16,941
but he's just pretending not to!

368
00:30:39,628 --> 00:30:40,628
Where is he?

369
00:30:55,615 --> 00:30:58,863
Happy Birthday, my dear friend.

370
00:31:02,397 --> 00:31:03,916
You actually remembered?

371
00:31:03,916 --> 00:31:05,122
Of course, I remembered.

372
00:31:05,122 --> 00:31:09,655
Your birthday happens to be the same day
as my wedding anniversary.

373
00:31:10,849 --> 00:31:13,009
I was about to get emotional,
thought you remembered.

374
00:31:13,009 --> 00:31:15,349
It's fine if I didn't remember.

375
00:31:15,349 --> 00:31:19,234
As long as your dear secretary remembered,
that's enough.

376
00:31:20,909 --> 00:31:22,118
She should have forgotten.

377
00:31:23,675 --> 00:31:26,865
There were no Happy Birthday messages,
just the schedule.

378
00:31:29,794 --> 00:31:31,366
Is she messing with you?

379
00:31:31,366 --> 00:31:33,634
Acting like she forgot,
but actually planning a surprise?

380
00:31:33,634 --> 00:31:35,302
What surprise? She's in the hospital.

381
00:31:35,302 --> 00:31:37,431
What hospital? She came to work this morning.

382
00:31:38,051 --> 00:31:39,056
Huh?

383
00:31:39,056 --> 00:31:41,994
See, it means she was pretending to forget,

384
00:31:41,994 --> 00:31:45,158
then went to prepare everything
and came to surprise you for sure.

385
00:31:47,555 --> 00:31:49,059
- She didn't forget?
- Yep.

386
00:31:51,236 --> 00:31:54,451
Is this the first year
I'm celebrating my birthday with my girlfriend?

387
00:31:56,872 --> 00:31:59,276
You're calling her your "girlfriend" out loud?

388
00:31:59,276 --> 00:32:01,425
Stop it! Such a flirt!

389
00:32:01,425 --> 00:32:03,210
You're making me blush, you silly man!

390
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:05,296
You silly man!

391
00:32:08,435 --> 00:32:11,019
Hey, man. Hey.

392
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:16,262
Sorry, I'll be back later.

393
00:32:16,262 --> 00:32:17,417
Stop, Fah!

394
00:32:18,783 --> 00:32:23,274
It's time for me
to explain this to you clearly.

395
00:32:23,813 --> 00:32:27,271
The situation with me and Boss,
it's not what you think.

396
00:32:29,262 --> 00:32:30,699
Is there more to it than that?

397
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,582
No! Are you insane?

398
00:32:34,603 --> 00:32:36,175
Weirdo! You fool!

399
00:32:36,175 --> 00:32:38,525
Hey, listen to me!

400
00:32:54,360 --> 00:32:55,858
Oh, Boss?

401
00:32:56,425 --> 00:32:57,658
How did you get here?

402
00:32:58,546 --> 00:33:00,392
I should be asking you, how did you get here?

403
00:33:00,392 --> 00:33:02,959
I told you to rest and recover
before coming back to work.

404
00:33:02,959 --> 00:33:04,449
Why are you here?

405
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,304
I just came to take pictures of the land across

406
00:33:07,304 --> 00:33:09,614
and gather data as you instructed.

407
00:33:20,424 --> 00:33:21,831
No way.

408
00:33:21,831 --> 00:33:23,817
You're here to surprise me, right?

409
00:33:25,220 --> 00:33:26,865
What surprise?

410
00:33:26,865 --> 00:33:28,111
My work is piling up,

411
00:33:28,111 --> 00:33:29,875
so I had to come back and finish it.

412
00:33:31,288 --> 00:33:32,288
Huh?

413
00:33:33,373 --> 00:33:34,522
Is something wrong, Boss?

414
00:33:36,063 --> 00:33:37,063
Nothing.

415
00:33:37,843 --> 00:33:38,843
Forget it.

416
00:33:39,730 --> 00:33:42,069
Oh, since you're already here,

417
00:33:42,069 --> 00:33:45,662
how about we go inspect
the venue for the event?

418
00:33:45,662 --> 00:33:47,689
Why are you only focusing on work like that?

419
00:33:47,689 --> 00:33:50,883
I just want to clear all my work
and do my best,

420
00:33:50,883 --> 00:33:53,539
because my job
as your secretary will soon be over.

421
00:33:58,449 --> 00:34:01,343
I thought we'd be working together forever.

422
00:34:03,068 --> 00:34:04,989
In the end, you're still going to quit.

423
00:34:08,622 --> 00:34:09,622
But it's fine.

424
00:34:10,517 --> 00:34:14,403
Even though I'll be sad,
heartbroken, and unable to work for a few days,

425
00:34:14,963 --> 00:34:16,063
But I understand.

426
00:34:16,589 --> 00:34:17,589
I'll let you go.

427
00:34:19,522 --> 00:34:21,256
Don't be dramatic.

428
00:34:21,256 --> 00:34:23,111
I'm not dead.

429
00:34:23,111 --> 00:34:26,251
We're just not working together anymore.
Don't overthink it.

430
00:34:28,324 --> 00:34:31,376
Then, how about we skip work
this afternoon and go on a date?

431
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:35,579
I can't. I have a meeting
with the hotel side at 1 pm.

432
00:34:35,579 --> 00:34:36,594
How about 2 pm?

433
00:34:36,594 --> 00:34:38,800
I have a meeting
with all the secretaries at 2 pm.

434
00:34:38,800 --> 00:34:39,869
Then, how about 3 pm?

435
00:34:39,869 --> 00:34:42,735
At 3 pm, I have a meeting
with corporate communications.

436
00:34:42,735 --> 00:34:45,505
Why do you have so many meetings?
Are you the CEO or something?

437
00:34:45,505 --> 00:34:48,271
I already told you, I have work to do.

438
00:34:48,271 --> 00:34:50,427
That's why I had to
come out of the hospital early.

439
00:34:55,694 --> 00:34:58,016
But today, I really want to be with you.

440
00:34:59,595 --> 00:35:02,301
Why? Can't you do that on another day?

441
00:35:08,103 --> 00:35:10,481
Nothing, really, nothing.

442
00:35:11,337 --> 00:35:13,538
Go ahead and do the work you love.

443
00:35:15,743 --> 00:35:19,011
Okay, then I'll go back to work now.

444
00:35:25,084 --> 00:35:26,376
No surprise, really?

445
00:35:27,748 --> 00:35:30,019
Why is my life so miserable?

446
00:35:33,715 --> 00:35:35,659
You really want to work, huh?

447
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:38,112
Fine, I'll take care of that.

448
00:35:43,749 --> 00:35:45,061
What did you say, Ta?

449
00:35:45,061 --> 00:35:46,850
Has the Vice President
replaced me in the meeting?

450
00:35:46,850 --> 00:35:48,319
Yes, Prim.

451
00:35:48,319 --> 00:35:50,054
Boss helped us with the plan

452
00:35:50,054 --> 00:35:52,608
and even approved the budget,
all done and dusted.

453
00:35:52,608 --> 00:35:53,673
Huh?

454
00:35:53,673 --> 00:35:54,675
What did you say?

455
00:35:54,675 --> 00:35:56,542
Boss said he would attend
the meeting instead of me

456
00:35:56,542 --> 00:35:59,210
and take the issues the team faced
into consideration,

457
00:35:59,210 --> 00:36:00,537
then just ended the meeting?

458
00:36:00,537 --> 00:36:01,858
Yes, that's right.

459
00:36:01,858 --> 00:36:04,183
Did Boss attend the meeting
and finish it already?

460
00:36:04,183 --> 00:36:05,209
- Yeah.
- Right.

461
00:36:05,209 --> 00:36:06,809
Such a wonderful boss.

462
00:36:06,809 --> 00:36:10,627
He's worried that his secretary will be busy,
so he helped clear the tasks.

463
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:13,863
Here's the meeting report, Prim, take a look.

464
00:36:13,863 --> 00:36:15,890
Did you finish writing the meeting report?

465
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:17,964
Nope, Boss wrote it.

466
00:36:17,964 --> 00:36:19,640
- What?
- No need for that.

467
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,632
He attended the meeting
and wrote the report at the same time.

468
00:36:22,632 --> 00:36:26,298
I was so shocked,
my jaw practically hit the floor.

469
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:29,400
Does he really want me to be free?

470
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,400
- What?
- Huh?

471
00:36:31,001 --> 00:36:32,512
Oh, it's nothing!

472
00:36:37,318 --> 00:36:41,204
<i>I ask all employees who receive this message
to stop working immediately</i>

473
00:36:41,204 --> 00:36:44,408
<i>and go use the new spa service
at the mall for free,</i>

474
00:36:44,408 --> 00:36:47,601
<i>as a way to relax from work. Thank you.</i>

475
00:36:48,769 --> 00:36:49,895
Is it the same message?

476
00:36:49,895 --> 00:36:51,053
Yes, that's right.

477
00:36:51,053 --> 00:36:54,393
Boss said to stop working
and go get a free spa treatment.

478
00:36:55,230 --> 00:36:56,395
What?

479
00:36:56,395 --> 00:36:57,504
No matter what,

480
00:36:58,137 --> 00:36:59,182
Boss is so kind.

481
00:36:59,182 --> 00:37:00,182
I have to scream!

482
00:37:01,396 --> 00:37:02,403
- Go!
- Let's go!

483
00:37:02,403 --> 00:37:03,617
Yes, let's prepare!

484
00:37:03,617 --> 00:37:05,236
See you later, Prim.

485
00:37:05,236 --> 00:37:07,260
Did he just win the lottery?

486
00:37:16,830 --> 00:37:18,798
I've cleared all the work for you

487
00:37:18,798 --> 00:37:21,364
and made sure everyone
who works with you gets to rest too.

488
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:23,587
No one will be following up
on your work for sure.

489
00:37:23,587 --> 00:37:26,367
So, now we can go on a date, right?

490
00:37:30,129 --> 00:37:31,663
Unbelievable.

491
00:37:35,004 --> 00:37:39,596
You know, in our office,
there are several couples secretly dating.

492
00:37:40,919 --> 00:37:42,721
The accounting department
and the facilities team…

493
00:37:42,721 --> 00:37:45,729
- They have two more pairs recently.
- Really?

494
00:37:45,729 --> 00:37:48,067
Oh my gosh, that's spicy!

495
00:37:48,067 --> 00:37:50,897
Wait a minute,
if you want to date, just go date.

496
00:37:50,897 --> 00:37:52,568
Why keep it a secret?

497
00:37:53,243 --> 00:37:57,462
This new kid doesn't know anything, huh?

498
00:37:57,462 --> 00:37:59,330
Dating at work…

499
00:37:59,330 --> 00:38:02,389
It can affect work responsibilities.

500
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:05,766
For example, some might think
there are conflicts of interest.

501
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:09,276
Some might even think it's corruption.

502
00:38:09,276 --> 00:38:10,501
And things would get even worse

503
00:38:10,501 --> 00:38:13,035
if you end up fighting,
arguing, or breaking up.

504
00:38:13,035 --> 00:38:16,118
The company's image would look bad. Understand?

505
00:38:16,118 --> 00:38:17,118
You fool!

506
00:38:18,511 --> 00:38:20,210
- Speak to that way.
- Yeah.

507
00:38:20,210 --> 00:38:22,130
You just wanted to scream at me, didn't you?

508
00:38:22,130 --> 00:38:26,788
Does that mean you're not interested in anyone
in the office, then?

509
00:38:26,788 --> 00:38:28,309
It's not that she's not interested,

510
00:38:28,309 --> 00:38:31,724
it's just no one is interested in her.

511
00:38:31,724 --> 00:38:32,774
For this girl,

512
00:38:32,774 --> 00:38:35,409
no one would ever come
looking for her down here.

513
00:38:35,409 --> 00:38:38,903
She's confusing, like a maze
that makes people lose themselves.

514
00:38:38,903 --> 00:38:40,044
Hey, you!

515
00:38:40,044 --> 00:38:42,222
Stop exaggerating.
I'm not the Amazon rainforest.

516
00:38:42,222 --> 00:38:43,914
I won't make people lose their way.

517
00:38:43,914 --> 00:38:45,859
Huh, I do have someone in mind,

518
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:47,882
- but I just don't want to show off.
- Huh?

519
00:38:47,882 --> 00:38:49,546
Who? Tell us! Spill it out!

520
00:38:49,546 --> 00:38:52,614
Sis, are you secretly
eyeing someone at the office?

521
00:38:52,614 --> 00:38:56,583
I was just saying, nothing serious, really!

522
00:39:00,963 --> 00:39:02,003
What's wrong, dear?

523
00:39:03,324 --> 00:39:04,793
You know…

524
00:39:04,793 --> 00:39:08,613
Our son refuses to eat or leave the room,

525
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,774
and I'm worried something might happen.

526
00:39:16,136 --> 00:39:17,358
All of this…

527
00:39:18,998 --> 00:39:20,982
It's because my family and I…

528
00:39:21,824 --> 00:39:23,497
made him end up like this.

529
00:39:24,435 --> 00:39:29,500
<i>Wow, you scored number 1 in the class?</i>

530
00:39:29,500 --> 00:39:32,730
<i>My dear grandchild is so talented.</i>

531
00:39:34,535 --> 00:39:35,535
<i>Okay.</i>

532
00:39:36,323 --> 00:39:37,953
<i>I'll give you a reward.</i>

533
00:39:40,006 --> 00:39:41,822
<i>Say thank you to your grandpa, dear.</i>

534
00:39:42,756 --> 00:39:44,002
<i>Thank you very much!</i>

535
00:40:02,094 --> 00:40:03,094
<i>Thee!</i>

536
00:40:03,994 --> 00:40:05,007
<i>Thee!</i>

537
00:40:05,007 --> 00:40:07,362
<i>Thee! What happened?</i>

538
00:40:07,362 --> 00:40:09,320
<i>Thee! Thee!</i>

539
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,509
<i>Thee, what happened?</i>

540
00:40:11,509 --> 00:40:12,786
<i>Thee!</i>

541
00:40:12,786 --> 00:40:15,045
<i>Thee! Thee, Thee!</i>

542
00:40:15,045 --> 00:40:17,473
<i>What just happened, Thee?</i>

543
00:40:17,473 --> 00:40:19,998
<i>Thee! What happened, dear?</i>

544
00:40:22,494 --> 00:40:26,243
<i>Why does your oldest son
behave so strangely these days?</i>

545
00:40:26,243 --> 00:40:27,440
<i>How can he…</i>

546
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:31,377
<i>be jealous of his younger brother
to the point of hurting himself?</i>

547
00:40:34,296 --> 00:40:35,686
<i>He's still young.</i>

548
00:40:36,806 --> 00:40:40,283
<i>I'll take him to see a psychiatrist.</i>

549
00:40:40,283 --> 00:40:43,590
<i>Being the eldest in the family and acting weak.</i>

550
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:46,852
<i>How is he supposed to take
over the family business?</i>

551
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:53,617
<i>I guess we'll have to put our hopes
in our youngest one.</i>

552
00:40:57,932 --> 00:40:58,960
<i>Right, my grandchild?</i>

553
00:41:10,926 --> 00:41:14,292
Well, I think you shouldn't overthink it.

554
00:41:14,292 --> 00:41:17,663
Things have gone too far now.

555
00:41:18,820 --> 00:41:23,242
I'm also to blame for how I raised him.

556
00:41:25,258 --> 00:41:28,515
Let's focus on finding a solution
to the current problem.

557
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:37,988
Tham!

558
00:41:38,759 --> 00:41:40,194
Come on, let's go.

559
00:41:41,505 --> 00:41:42,623
- Tham!
- Tham!

560
00:41:42,623 --> 00:41:43,823
- Tham!
- Tham!

561
00:41:43,823 --> 00:41:45,047
- Tham, son!
- Tham!

562
00:41:45,047 --> 00:41:46,147
- Tham!
- Take it easy, okay?

563
00:41:46,147 --> 00:41:49,566
- Tham, Tham, dear!
- Breathe deeply, son.

564
00:41:49,566 --> 00:41:51,110
- Breathe deeply.
- Honey!

565
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,157
- Tham!
- Just calm down, son.

566
00:42:02,347 --> 00:42:06,147
Oh, I need to act all pretty,
fabulous, and proud now.

567
00:42:30,895 --> 00:42:31,895
Bhum, ma'am.

568
00:42:35,170 --> 00:42:36,170
What is it?

569
00:42:39,749 --> 00:42:40,749
Here you go.

570
00:42:42,426 --> 00:42:43,752
What's this?

571
00:42:43,752 --> 00:42:46,122
It's a business card
from a physiotherapist's clinic.

572
00:42:47,663 --> 00:42:49,441
I noticed you were walking stiffly,

573
00:42:49,441 --> 00:42:51,946
You might have had a neck problem
or a pulled muscle, right?

574
00:42:51,946 --> 00:42:54,397
You're getting older,
you should take better care of yourself.

575
00:42:55,491 --> 00:42:57,165
<i>[Sommai, Physiotherapist]</i>

576
00:43:02,779 --> 00:43:07,085
Hello, Pen! I'm on my way, yeah, yeah.

577
00:43:08,250 --> 00:43:10,655
Bhum, I'll take my leave now.

578
00:43:11,328 --> 00:43:13,820
Anyway, don't forget to visit the doctor.

579
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,209
This doctor is really good
at treating joint diseases,

580
00:43:16,209 --> 00:43:17,675
gout, and other ailments of the elderly.

581
00:43:17,675 --> 00:43:19,450
He's very skilled.

582
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,317
Take care of yourself, okay? Excuse me.

583
00:43:22,317 --> 00:43:25,075
Hello, on my way. Yeah, yeah, Pen.

584
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:28,458
Who is this Pen?

585
00:43:29,339 --> 00:43:32,273
She can't just steal
my Yong away from me like this!

586
00:43:34,112 --> 00:43:36,944
Dr. Sommai or whatever, physiotherapy, huh?

587
00:43:36,944 --> 00:43:39,228
Why is he repeating the word "old"?

588
00:43:52,762 --> 00:43:54,406
<i>To our eighth-year relationship.</i>

589
00:43:54,406 --> 00:43:56,343
<i>And, our anniversary.</i>

590
00:43:58,703 --> 00:44:00,732
Oh, no, it's quite hard.

591
00:44:00,732 --> 00:44:02,859
Hey, no, I can't. I can't!

592
00:44:09,766 --> 00:44:11,263
I guess I'll have to celebrate alone.

593
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:21,140
What's up?

594
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:23,720
Are you here to celebrate our ninth year?

595
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,042
Stop running away already.

596
00:44:33,346 --> 00:44:34,567
<i>Hey, what are you doing?</i>

597
00:44:35,368 --> 00:44:36,790
<i>Where are you packing your bag to?</i>

598
00:44:36,790 --> 00:44:37,798
<i>You can't leave.</i>

599
00:44:38,618 --> 00:44:39,998
<i>What right do you have to stop me?</i>

600
00:44:40,990 --> 00:44:42,008
<i>Do you know what?</i>

601
00:44:42,813 --> 00:44:46,033
<i>I'm tired, I'm fed up.</i>

602
00:44:46,553 --> 00:44:50,517
<i>In these 8 years,
it's only been me trying to change for you.</i>

603
00:44:50,517 --> 00:44:54,152
<i>You've never tried to do anything,
never making things better.</i>

604
00:44:54,152 --> 00:44:56,010
<i>Enough, I can't do this anymore.</i>

605
00:44:56,010 --> 00:44:58,812
<i>Tell me the truth. You think
you're the only one who's been adjusting?</i>

606
00:44:58,812 --> 00:45:00,898
<i>You think you've always
been doing the right thing?</i>

607
00:45:00,898 --> 00:45:02,506
<i>You think I've never adjusted?</i>

608
00:45:03,387 --> 00:45:06,248
<i>Have you seen my effort?
I've tried so many things.</i>

609
00:45:07,441 --> 00:45:09,978
<i>Have you ever listened to anyone else?</i>

610
00:45:11,195 --> 00:45:12,255
<i>Is it really that bad?</i>

611
00:45:12,255 --> 00:45:14,771
<i>Yes, I've tried explaining to you many times,</i>

612
00:45:14,771 --> 00:45:16,460
<i>but you never listen to me.</i>

613
00:45:18,919 --> 00:45:20,532
<i>If it's that bad…</i>

614
00:45:21,581 --> 00:45:22,689
<i>then let's end this today.</i>

615
00:45:22,689 --> 00:45:23,764
<i>No way.</i>

616
00:45:23,764 --> 00:45:25,106
<i>You want a divorce? I won't let you divorce me.</i>

617
00:45:25,106 --> 00:45:28,232
<i>- Let go. Let go!
- I won't let go. I won't let you go!</i>

618
00:45:28,232 --> 00:45:29,603
<i>What right do you have to take my bag?</i>

619
00:45:29,603 --> 00:45:31,130
<i>Why do you always have to choose this way?</i>

620
00:45:31,130 --> 00:45:33,041
<i>There are other better ways.</i>

621
00:45:33,041 --> 00:45:34,810
<i>Why don't we help each other?</i>

622
00:45:34,810 --> 00:45:38,524
<i>If the other way was better,
it would have been better a long time ago.</i>

623
00:45:38,524 --> 00:45:40,413
<i>Why waste your time for 8 years?</i>

624
00:45:41,692 --> 00:45:42,724
<i>Aren't you tired?</i>

625
00:45:43,845 --> 00:45:45,658
<i>It's so simple like that, huh?</i>

626
00:45:46,509 --> 00:45:48,824
<i>Just that simple, right?</i>

627
00:45:51,674 --> 00:45:52,825
<i>Yeah, it's that simple.</i>

628
00:45:54,208 --> 00:45:55,921
<i>- Don't go, please don't go.
- Let go.</i>

629
00:45:55,921 --> 00:45:57,865
<i>- Let's talk this through, okay?
- Let go! Let go.</i>

630
00:45:57,865 --> 00:45:59,827
<i>- Can we talk this through?
- Not today.</i>

631
00:45:59,827 --> 00:46:01,173
<i>- I'm done.
- Can we talk this through?</i>

632
00:46:01,173 --> 00:46:03,511
<i>I'm done, you hear? Let go.</i>

633
00:46:04,708 --> 00:46:05,708
<i>Let go.</i>

634
00:46:17,795 --> 00:46:20,067
When will you finally sign the divorce papers?

635
00:46:23,294 --> 00:46:24,378
Can we talk?

636
00:46:25,908 --> 00:46:27,154
Can you give me a chance?

637
00:46:27,863 --> 00:46:29,121
It's too late now.

638
00:46:35,457 --> 00:46:37,412
I think you need to move on.

639
00:46:38,077 --> 00:46:40,040
Stop being stuck in the past already.

640
00:46:43,908 --> 00:46:44,908
Here.

641
00:46:51,549 --> 00:46:53,783
I won't sign, I can't.

642
00:46:58,633 --> 00:46:59,641
It's fine.

643
00:47:00,986 --> 00:47:02,009
I have another one.

644
00:47:04,551 --> 00:47:06,219
I said I won't sign.

645
00:47:09,774 --> 00:47:11,256
Fine, take it all.

646
00:47:11,256 --> 00:47:12,455
I got a lot.

647
00:47:16,447 --> 00:47:19,455
Look, I'm begging you.

648
00:47:19,455 --> 00:47:21,442
Let's stop dragging this out.

649
00:47:21,442 --> 00:47:25,930
You know, both you and me,
we can never go back to how we were.

650
00:47:28,855 --> 00:47:31,162
I hope you realize this soon.

651
00:47:32,014 --> 00:47:33,042
I'll be waiting.

652
00:47:34,291 --> 00:47:37,106
Pick one and just sign it.

653
00:47:37,106 --> 00:47:39,782
Make sure you return all of them.

654
00:47:39,782 --> 00:47:40,811
They're expensive.

655
00:47:50,588 --> 00:47:53,136
Maybe the gift is hidden in the room.

656
00:48:23,402 --> 00:48:24,704
I don't see anything.

657
00:48:33,736 --> 00:48:34,741
Hello, Mom.

658
00:48:45,159 --> 00:48:46,207
Where's the date?

659
00:48:46,981 --> 00:48:48,346
Why isn't he here yet?

660
00:48:53,743 --> 00:48:57,307
<i>You go ahead and shop for a bit.
I'm tied up with family stuff.</i>

661
00:48:57,307 --> 00:48:59,823
<i>I'll come find you as soon as I'm done.</i>

662
00:48:59,823 --> 00:49:02,040
<i>Miss you, Muah muah.</i>

663
00:49:03,958 --> 00:49:05,102
Okay.

664
00:49:06,975 --> 00:49:11,408
<i>[It's the boss's birthday today.
Don't forget about the gift.]</i>

665
00:49:11,408 --> 00:49:12,408
Huh?

666
00:49:13,285 --> 00:49:14,852
Today's the boss's birthday?

667
00:49:16,200 --> 00:49:18,240
Oh no, I completely forgot!

668
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:23,627
Sorry!

669
00:49:24,636 --> 00:49:25,636
Hey!

670
00:49:26,265 --> 00:49:28,268
What are you doing
walking around naked out here?

671
00:49:28,931 --> 00:49:30,796
I'm wearing a towel, can't you see?

672
00:49:32,123 --> 00:49:33,123
Hey…

673
00:49:34,139 --> 00:49:36,337
My favorite jacket is gone! What should I do?

674
00:49:37,224 --> 00:49:38,265
Go look for it then.

675
00:49:41,035 --> 00:49:42,048
Move aside!

676
00:49:46,025 --> 00:49:47,540
What's with all this bumping?

677
00:49:47,540 --> 00:49:49,548
- Go look somewhere else!
- Oh!

678
00:49:55,203 --> 00:49:57,049
Stop freaking out about everything else.

679
00:49:57,049 --> 00:49:58,366
Focus on my jacket first!

680
00:50:01,508 --> 00:50:02,876
Well…

681
00:50:02,876 --> 00:50:04,615
Don't you love that jacket so much?

682
00:50:04,615 --> 00:50:06,918
You shouldn't have just left it
lying around like that.

683
00:50:06,918 --> 00:50:09,226
Get a grip and think carefully.

684
00:50:09,226 --> 00:50:11,056
Where could it have possibly gone?

685
00:50:23,896 --> 00:50:25,196
I can't think of anywhere.

686
00:50:25,196 --> 00:50:27,509
But I remember hanging it up in the same spot.

687
00:50:29,482 --> 00:50:30,482
Please…

688
00:50:31,482 --> 00:50:32,630
Can you help me look for it?

689
00:50:35,963 --> 00:50:38,133
Fine, I'll help you look for it.

690
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:47,210
Tham…

691
00:50:47,766 --> 00:50:50,305
Please eat something
so you can take your medicine.

692
00:50:55,176 --> 00:50:58,256
Tham, can you say something to me, please?

693
00:50:58,896 --> 00:51:01,654
You've been like this,
and I'm really worried about you.

694
00:51:13,901 --> 00:51:16,848
Tham, your brother is here to visit.

695
00:51:17,390 --> 00:51:19,058
Can you ask him to leave for now?

696
00:51:19,759 --> 00:51:21,240
I'm not ready to face him yet.

697
00:51:24,335 --> 00:51:25,976
I still feel guilty for…

698
00:51:26,718 --> 00:51:28,342
taking away his memories.

699
00:51:31,282 --> 00:51:33,647
- But, I think…
- Mom and Dad, you can go back too.

700
00:51:34,946 --> 00:51:36,518
I want to be alone.

701
00:51:45,989 --> 00:51:48,713
Oh, I've been looking for this forever.

702
00:51:48,713 --> 00:51:49,926
We still can't find it!

703
00:51:49,926 --> 00:51:51,533
Please help me look.

704
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:58,142
Are you sure
you didn't forget where you left it?

705
00:51:59,564 --> 00:52:01,831
I'm sure. How could I just leave it somewhere?

706
00:52:01,831 --> 00:52:04,641
That shirt is my soul!

707
00:52:07,313 --> 00:52:08,708
Well, I can kind of guess.

708
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:11,692
You wear it every day so it must stink by now.

709
00:52:16,230 --> 00:52:18,161
- Get in!
- What are you doing?

710
00:52:20,382 --> 00:52:22,611
Be quiet, Goody is coming this way.

711
00:52:22,611 --> 00:52:24,056
Yeah, right.

712
00:52:24,056 --> 00:52:26,398
There's a lot of gossip today.

713
00:52:26,398 --> 00:52:28,913
Wait, wait just a second.

714
00:52:31,957 --> 00:52:34,425
Oh, yeah, never mind.

715
00:52:36,231 --> 00:52:37,615
What's wrong with Goody?

716
00:52:40,641 --> 00:52:43,089
If anyone sees me looking for this shirt,

717
00:52:43,089 --> 00:52:46,743
they might ask why someone as rich as me
doesn't just buy a new one.

718
00:52:48,305 --> 00:52:49,660
Maybe you're just overthinking?

719
00:52:49,660 --> 00:52:52,186
Not overthinking. It's called being careful.

720
00:52:53,943 --> 00:52:57,085
This is why your life is hard.
You lie to everyone like this.

721
00:53:02,273 --> 00:53:03,273
The coast is clear.

722
00:53:03,987 --> 00:53:04,987
You can go now.

723
00:53:09,777 --> 00:53:10,777
Sure thing.

724
00:53:11,578 --> 00:53:13,976
Okay, I'll hurry and go now.

725
00:53:16,835 --> 00:53:19,454
What should I do?
I need to hurry back to fix some work.

726
00:53:21,309 --> 00:53:23,170
Can you find the shirt for me?

727
00:53:23,170 --> 00:53:24,464
Huh?

728
00:53:24,464 --> 00:53:26,827
Yes, you have to find it for me.

729
00:53:28,020 --> 00:53:30,009
Please help me. I'm begging you.

730
00:53:30,009 --> 00:53:31,548
Find my heart.

731
00:53:32,241 --> 00:53:33,241
Please.

732
00:53:36,333 --> 00:53:37,527
Fine.

733
00:53:37,527 --> 00:53:38,868
Yay!

734
00:53:38,868 --> 00:53:39,868
Hey!

735
00:54:03,102 --> 00:54:04,450
What's with you?

736
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:06,179
What's with the sudden hug?

737
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:07,899
My parents wouldn't allow it, you know?

738
00:54:10,639 --> 00:54:11,639
Thanks!

739
00:54:12,438 --> 00:54:14,695
I'll apologize to your parents later.

740
00:54:21,622 --> 00:54:22,622
Thee,

741
00:54:28,925 --> 00:54:33,679
I heard from Tham that
you didn't lose your memory,

742
00:54:35,247 --> 00:54:38,948
but you pretended not to remember.
Is that true, Thee?

743
00:54:42,703 --> 00:54:43,703
Yes, it's true.

744
00:54:45,202 --> 00:54:46,202
Oh my…

745
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:53,770
Can you tell your dad and mom
what happened back then,

746
00:54:55,150 --> 00:54:57,516
and why you decided to do this?

747
00:54:59,690 --> 00:55:01,679
When I'm ready, I'll tell you.

748
00:55:27,375 --> 00:55:29,473
Why can't I get that image out of my head?

749
00:55:30,668 --> 00:55:33,035
And why is my heart beating so fast?

750
00:55:34,362 --> 00:55:35,707
What's going on with me?

751
00:55:40,489 --> 00:55:42,138
Oh, excuse me.

752
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,737
This jacket is…

753
00:55:44,737 --> 00:55:46,962
It fell into a basket,

754
00:55:46,962 --> 00:55:48,972
and I didn't know whose it was.

755
00:55:57,504 --> 00:55:59,926
Oh, can I see it?

756
00:56:04,891 --> 00:56:08,765
This is it. It's my friend's jacket.

757
00:56:08,765 --> 00:56:10,564
I'll take it back to him.

758
00:56:10,564 --> 00:56:12,200
Thank you so much!

759
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,200
You're welcome.

760
00:56:17,867 --> 00:56:19,171
That's the smell, yeah.

761
00:56:30,217 --> 00:56:31,217
Prim…

762
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,170
Have you been waiting long?

763
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:34,445
Sorry for being late.

764
00:56:35,850 --> 00:56:36,944
It's okay.

765
00:56:38,241 --> 00:56:40,646
Is everything alright at home?

766
00:56:41,294 --> 00:56:42,775
Is there anything I can help with?

767
00:56:43,935 --> 00:56:46,235
Nothing, don't worry about it.

768
00:56:48,581 --> 00:56:49,581
Okay.

769
00:56:50,238 --> 00:56:55,607
Since you've gone out of your way
and cleared all my work for me,

770
00:56:55,607 --> 00:56:57,012
where do you want to go today?

771
00:57:16,583 --> 00:57:18,290
Do you know that
this place used to be the abandoned house

772
00:57:18,290 --> 00:57:20,169
where we were locked up together?

773
00:57:22,190 --> 00:57:24,757
But now, it's become a home for fish.

774
00:57:26,131 --> 00:57:27,131
Really?

775
00:57:27,953 --> 00:57:31,732
I can't imagine that this place used to be…

776
00:57:31,732 --> 00:57:33,387
I've bought this place…

777
00:57:34,734 --> 00:57:37,120
To destroy all the bad memories in the past.

778
00:57:37,944 --> 00:57:39,694
To bury all the pain

779
00:57:40,747 --> 00:57:43,111
and create a place of happiness instead.

780
00:57:48,375 --> 00:57:51,940
And I hope that from now on,
the memories we share.

781
00:57:53,320 --> 00:57:55,519
It will be as happy as this place.

782
00:57:57,601 --> 00:57:58,601
Sure.

783
00:57:59,801 --> 00:58:04,156
Let's be happy together and bury the past here,

784
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:08,859
like Big Bang's bones,
which by now must have turned to dust.

785
00:58:13,536 --> 00:58:17,935
I wish you could move forward
without any more pain.

786
00:58:20,546 --> 00:58:22,055
But you have to be with me.

787
00:58:24,422 --> 00:58:25,422
Yes.

788
00:58:32,056 --> 00:58:33,876
Please close your eyes.

789
00:58:33,876 --> 00:58:34,962
Why am I closing my eyes?

790
00:58:35,903 --> 00:58:36,903
Just do it.

791
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:40,115
Okay.

792
00:58:49,053 --> 00:58:52,635
Happy Birthday to you.

793
00:58:52,635 --> 00:58:54,992
I thought you forgot my birthday already.

794
00:58:55,870 --> 00:58:57,985
I almost did.

795
00:58:59,704 --> 00:59:02,117
Happy Birthday, my prince.

796
00:59:05,832 --> 00:59:07,935
Even though I look like a prince,

797
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:11,076
when you call me that,

798
00:59:11,948 --> 00:59:13,009
I get shy.

799
00:59:14,437 --> 00:59:15,437
Really?

800
00:59:15,942 --> 00:59:16,942
Prince?

801
00:59:19,871 --> 00:59:22,677
Try calling me "darling" instead.
Maybe I won't feel shy.

802
00:59:23,879 --> 00:59:26,545
That, I'd feel shy.

803
00:59:28,950 --> 00:59:31,670
I thought this birthday
would be a Black Birthday.

804
00:59:48,693 --> 00:59:50,113
What did you wish for?

805
00:59:51,001 --> 00:59:53,890
I wished for you to be my princess forever.

806
01:00:31,754 --> 01:00:34,484
Today was so much fun, thank you.

807
01:00:34,484 --> 01:00:36,970
How could you not enjoy
being with someone this perfect?

808
01:00:39,043 --> 01:00:40,100
Well then, I'll go now.

809
01:00:45,462 --> 01:00:48,014
I want to be with you every second, you know.

810
01:00:50,225 --> 01:00:52,596
Even when I go to the bathroom?

811
01:00:52,596 --> 01:00:53,906
My fart stinks.

812
01:00:55,109 --> 01:00:57,603
It's okay, my girlfriend's fart won't stink.

813
01:00:57,603 --> 01:00:58,603
I can handle it.

814
01:00:59,212 --> 01:01:00,439
And more importantly,

815
01:01:02,357 --> 01:01:03,954
mine stinks even worse.

816
01:01:05,459 --> 01:01:07,412
You fart is also dramatic too?

817
01:01:07,412 --> 01:01:08,670
You crazy lover.

818
01:01:09,541 --> 01:01:10,752
Go home now.

819
01:01:11,470 --> 01:01:12,544
Drive safe.

820
01:01:14,415 --> 01:01:16,044
- Bye-bye.
- Bye.

821
01:01:28,340 --> 01:01:29,882
Prim! Prim!

822
01:01:31,212 --> 01:01:34,339
Prim! Prim! Someone help!

823
01:01:35,265 --> 01:01:36,971
Is anyone here? Help!

824
01:01:37,786 --> 01:01:39,512
Somebody call an ambulance!

825
01:01:41,227 --> 01:01:42,227
Prim!

826
01:01:57,979 --> 01:02:00,507
I want to hear the whole story now.

827
01:02:00,507 --> 01:02:04,318
Are you ready to tell us everything?

828
01:02:04,318 --> 01:02:05,342
I'm ready now.

829
01:02:05,342 --> 01:02:07,322
You found it? Thank you!

830
01:02:08,529 --> 01:02:10,752
I won the lottery! I'm going to be rich!

831
01:02:14,623 --> 01:02:16,382
That was a real sudden windfall!

832
01:02:16,382 --> 01:02:17,941
Where are you planning to go this time?

833
01:02:17,941 --> 01:02:19,231
How do you expect me to feel?

834
01:02:19,231 --> 01:02:21,518
Did I seem so weak and pathetic?

835
01:02:21,518 --> 01:02:23,766
That you didn't think I could face the truth?
