1
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,331
Your soulmate is right in front of you.

2
00:01:07,331 --> 00:01:09,896
Because the red thing is holding you together.

3
00:01:09,896 --> 00:01:13,624
I know you brought me here to be a shield,
to avoid being set up.

4
00:01:13,624 --> 00:01:16,871
I was just wondering if Prim and Boss are

5
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:18,802
dating or something?

6
00:01:20,442 --> 00:01:23,206
If those two were to date,
they'd have done it long ago!

7
00:01:23,206 --> 00:01:24,605
- True!
- Yeah.

8
00:01:24,605 --> 00:01:26,918
I didn't just come back
because of the book launch.

9
00:01:26,918 --> 00:01:27,935
I came back because of you.

10
00:01:27,935 --> 00:01:30,341
This is Dr. Tawan,
having a great job and a stellar profile.

11
00:01:30,341 --> 00:01:31,345
Secretary Prim.

12
00:01:31,345 --> 00:01:33,552
This is the Vice President, my Boss.

13
00:01:33,552 --> 00:01:34,660
"Prim's."

14
00:01:34,660 --> 00:01:36,739
"Prim's boss." I heard it loud and clear.

15
00:01:36,739 --> 00:01:38,217
You looked pretty chummy with Kawee.

16
00:01:38,217 --> 00:01:39,301
Aren't you afraid of being
touched inappropriately?

17
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:41,723
Kawee doesn't behave that way.

18
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:43,667
Do you know him that well?
Why don't you date him already?

19
00:01:43,667 --> 00:01:45,320
That sounds like an interesting idea.

20
00:01:46,180 --> 00:01:48,713
Anyway, Kawee really does look good.

21
00:01:48,713 --> 00:01:50,194
The girls were all screaming for him.

22
00:01:50,194 --> 00:01:52,897
If I married him,
I wouldn't be ashamed of anyone.

23
00:02:04,068 --> 00:02:08,667
No! If you're going to get married,
you have to marry only me.

24
00:02:21,619 --> 00:02:22,876
What did you just say, Boss?

25
00:02:26,644 --> 00:02:28,308
I said, if you're going to get married,

26
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:33,123
you have to marry only me.

27
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:38,610
Do you have a fever?

28
00:02:41,253 --> 00:02:42,450
I'm fine.

29
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:43,964
No, you're definitely unwell.

30
00:02:45,246 --> 00:02:46,692
I said I'm fine!

31
00:02:48,415 --> 00:02:52,352
If you're really fine, then
I don't need to stay any longer.

32
00:02:53,042 --> 00:02:55,300
I'll take my leave now. Bye.

33
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:56,931
Wait, Secretary Prim.

34
00:02:57,672 --> 00:02:59,051
Wait, Secretary Prim. wait!

35
00:03:01,101 --> 00:03:02,107
Secretary Prim!

36
00:03:16,398 --> 00:03:19,439
Secretary Prim, sunlight in the late
morning is more harmful than beneficial.

37
00:03:21,029 --> 00:03:22,055
Thank you.

38
00:03:22,055 --> 00:03:24,417
Why didn't you let me pick you
up at the condo this morning?

39
00:03:25,748 --> 00:03:29,112
If you went, it would just be stuck in traffic.
It's easier for me to come on my own.

40
00:03:35,133 --> 00:03:36,191
Who are you talking to?

41
00:03:38,296 --> 00:03:40,105
My face is here, not on the floor.

42
00:03:42,471 --> 00:03:43,721
Excuse me, I have to clock in.

43
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,385
What's wrong with her, today?

44
00:03:50,345 --> 00:03:51,864
Why won't she look me in the eye?

45
00:03:54,283 --> 00:03:57,470
I know, it's because I'm so handsome, perfect.

46
00:03:57,470 --> 00:03:59,370
You'd feel shy
after looking at me for too long.

47
00:04:01,001 --> 00:04:02,765
Mom, look at this guy.

48
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:05,670
He's talking to himself.
Is he crazy or something?

49
00:04:08,326 --> 00:04:09,365
Don't bother him, dear.

50
00:04:39,502 --> 00:04:40,902
Should I schedule a doctor for you?

51
00:04:44,519 --> 00:04:46,330
Excuse me, Secretary Prim.

52
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,705
What's going on with you? Why…

53
00:04:50,839 --> 00:04:51,843
I know.

54
00:04:52,979 --> 00:04:55,409
You're shy because
I proposed to you last night.

55
00:04:56,104 --> 00:04:57,108
Boss!

56
00:04:59,112 --> 00:05:00,577
Don't tease me like this.

57
00:05:01,183 --> 00:05:02,587
I'm not having fun with this.

58
00:05:05,266 --> 00:05:06,270
Who says I'm teasing?

59
00:05:06,890 --> 00:05:08,057
I can repeat it if you want.

60
00:05:09,069 --> 00:05:10,069
No, please.

61
00:05:24,059 --> 00:05:27,139
Aren't you coming in? We are going to be late.

62
00:05:39,836 --> 00:05:43,980
Man, I'm laughing so much, my jaw is sore.

63
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:47,505
- Want some massage?
- No, I don't need it.

64
00:05:49,366 --> 00:05:52,026
What's so funny about me
asking Prim to marry me?

65
00:05:53,046 --> 00:05:55,559
What's funny is that you're
the one asking her to marry you!

66
00:05:55,559 --> 00:05:57,806
You're such an
unpredictable person.

67
00:05:57,806 --> 00:06:01,485
Do you know
what you're doing is really reckless?

68
00:06:03,867 --> 00:06:07,578
It's no wonder that Prim thinks you're sick.

69
00:06:07,578 --> 00:06:09,005
Why? Because I think so too.

70
00:06:09,727 --> 00:06:11,434
I'm not sick. I'm serious about this.

71
00:06:15,619 --> 00:06:19,748
I think Prim got shy and shocked,
so she lost her composure.

72
00:06:19,748 --> 00:06:22,408
Of course, she was shocked.
How could she not be?

73
00:06:22,408 --> 00:06:26,780
Because I'm Chonlathorn Theeranonsakul,
one of the top CEOs in Asia.

74
00:06:26,780 --> 00:06:29,619
As for me, Phatthanasin Singphathana.

75
00:06:29,619 --> 00:06:31,500
An ordinary guy who still hasn't
finished paying off his house loan,

76
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,809
I have refinanced it 3 times.

77
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:35,940
Since I was a kid, I have never seen
anyone ask a girl to marry them

78
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:38,199
while she's icing her feet.

79
00:06:39,052 --> 00:06:40,058
That's not okay?

80
00:06:42,822 --> 00:06:47,710
Hey, I think Secretary Prim might not
have lost her composure at all.

81
00:06:47,710 --> 00:06:51,420
She might just not want to marry you.

82
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:53,701
But she's afraid of your overconfidence,

83
00:06:53,701 --> 00:06:55,417
so she doesn't dare tell you directly.

84
00:06:56,236 --> 00:06:59,441
Okay, then I'll ask her and get to the bottom.

85
00:06:59,441 --> 00:07:04,037
Wait a minute, you! Sit down!

86
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:08,821
You're good at everything except for
dealing with human relationships.

87
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,049
What do you mean?

88
00:07:12,049 --> 00:07:15,952
Normal people are supposed
to take things step by step.

89
00:07:15,952 --> 00:07:20,852
Before getting married, don't you need
to flirt and get to know each other first?

90
00:07:21,519 --> 00:07:23,460
But I have been with her
for nine years already.

91
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:27,333
Oh my god, who did you send me to be with?

92
00:07:27,898 --> 00:07:30,652
That's not dating, that's
a working relationship! That doesn't count!

93
00:07:31,209 --> 00:07:32,212
Is that so?

94
00:07:38,544 --> 00:07:41,522
Aren't you thinking anything weird again?

95
00:07:45,795 --> 00:07:48,539
I'll leave it here for you
to put on the table later.

96
00:07:48,539 --> 00:07:49,212
Okay.

97
00:07:49,212 --> 00:07:50,914
- Don't forget to recheck it.
- Sure.

98
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:57,340
Secretary Prim, today I want coffee
from the second-floor café.

99
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:59,924
Okay. What kind of coffee
would Boss like today?

100
00:08:00,742 --> 00:08:01,979
L.O.V.E.

101
00:08:08,659 --> 00:08:10,605
It's an abbreviation for a coffee recipe.

102
00:08:11,256 --> 00:08:13,297
Latte, Oreo, Vanilla, Espresso, Double Shot.

103
00:08:15,961 --> 00:08:19,377
Latte, Oreo, Vanilla, Espresso, Double Shot.

104
00:08:20,337 --> 00:08:22,619
L.O.V.E.

105
00:08:23,497 --> 00:08:25,117
L.O.V.E, just like the word "love".

106
00:08:25,732 --> 00:08:27,579
Yes, I'll go buy it myself.

107
00:08:27,579 --> 00:08:28,585
Let Prim go buy it.

108
00:08:29,764 --> 00:08:32,610
You come fix
the hypercar launch speech with me.

109
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:55,764
What are you looking at?

110
00:08:55,764 --> 00:08:56,764
Sorry.

111
00:09:03,886 --> 00:09:04,895
All done.

112
00:09:07,119 --> 00:09:08,226
Thank you.

113
00:09:29,591 --> 00:09:30,595
What's that?

114
00:09:34,868 --> 00:09:36,733
A travel survey?

115
00:09:39,864 --> 00:09:43,479
Sorry, I don't have time to do it right now.

116
00:09:49,836 --> 00:09:52,773
Okay, okay, I'll do it. Wait a minute, please.

117
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:04,460
Man, if the people at the office see
me like this, will anyone respect me?

118
00:10:04,460 --> 00:10:05,859
Nobody respects you anyway.

119
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:13,010
This is it. After this,
Prim will definitely like me.

120
00:10:14,170 --> 00:10:18,815
Hey, when you were a kid, did you drink
confidence instead of your mom's milk?

121
00:10:18,815 --> 00:10:20,448
But you need to help me out a little.

122
00:10:22,239 --> 00:10:24,100
Can it be someone else? Huh?

123
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,513
I guess not.

124
00:10:28,466 --> 00:10:31,697
Fine, I'm your friend. I'll help you.

125
00:10:44,465 --> 00:10:46,271
Prim, is there anything else I can help with?

126
00:10:46,898 --> 00:10:48,500
No, that's all. You can go home now.

127
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:51,180
- Okay. Goodbye.
- Bye.

128
00:10:59,761 --> 00:11:01,188
<i>I just got a break to eat.</i>

129
00:11:01,188 --> 00:11:02,994
<i>Let me share a piece of donut with you, Prim.</i>

130
00:11:10,039 --> 00:11:11,280
Yes, Boss.

131
00:11:11,280 --> 00:11:14,637
I want to check on the renovation work
of our aquarium. Come with me.

132
00:11:16,372 --> 00:11:19,540
But isn't the inspection
scheduled for next week?

133
00:12:05,739 --> 00:12:09,261
This mission is top secret, Yong.
Don't tell anyone, no matter what.

134
00:12:09,820 --> 00:12:10,825
Yes, Director.

135
00:12:32,530 --> 00:12:34,297
So, what work do you have?

136
00:12:34,993 --> 00:12:37,508
It's not about work. It's about you.

137
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:40,973
What are you playing now?

138
00:12:42,023 --> 00:12:43,871
I'm not playing around. I'm serious.

139
00:12:43,871 --> 00:12:47,318
Today, no eye contact, avoiding,
and not speaking to me.

140
00:12:48,023 --> 00:12:50,739
At work, you might feel uncomfortable
with people's gazes.

141
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:54,393
So, I brought you here.
I also have something for you.

142
00:13:03,567 --> 00:13:04,594
Here you go, Director.

143
00:13:16,679 --> 00:13:18,154
Just wait and see, Yong.

144
00:13:18,154 --> 00:13:22,070
This scene is going to be so romantic!

145
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:24,523
Let's go for it.

146
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:41,716
Yong, how did you end up with this song?
What are you frozen for?

147
00:13:41,716 --> 00:13:43,111
Yes.

148
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:45,549
Look at this! Oh no, what happened?

149
00:13:47,905 --> 00:13:51,831
Is this it? My god, my life is ruined!
What should I do?

150
00:14:01,461 --> 00:14:04,539
Oh no, is this it?

151
00:14:07,664 --> 00:14:09,899
I hope this doesn't make you sneeze.

152
00:14:11,776 --> 00:14:15,865
I won't sneeze, but what's the occasion?

153
00:14:16,571 --> 00:14:19,197
It's the first day we're together
and our first date.

154
00:14:20,858 --> 00:14:22,460
But Prim…

155
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:26,906
Please don't refuse, because I'm someone
you wouldn't want to turn down.

156
00:15:15,939 --> 00:15:17,037
Do you like dolls?

157
00:15:18,533 --> 00:15:21,013
Yes, I do. I already like goldfish.

158
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:24,826
I can't believe I guessed your taste this well.

159
00:15:28,912 --> 00:15:31,545
Thank you, Boss.
If that's all, then I'll take my leave.

160
00:15:32,329 --> 00:15:34,496
Wait, is that it?

161
00:15:37,314 --> 00:15:38,876
We're together now, Secretary Prim.

162
00:15:39,827 --> 00:15:41,082
Before you leave, we need to…

163
00:16:07,826 --> 00:16:10,100
I guess we need to have a serious talk.

164
00:16:11,118 --> 00:16:12,561
I have something I want to say.

165
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:16,961
Go ahead, I'm listening.

166
00:16:17,977 --> 00:16:19,023
Honestly…

167
00:16:19,671 --> 00:16:20,671
Go ahead.

168
00:16:21,558 --> 00:16:22,970
Boss, you're not my type.

169
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:31,258
- Yong.
- Yes?

170
00:16:31,258 --> 00:16:32,460
- Start the car.
- Yes.

171
00:16:39,072 --> 00:16:40,779
- Yong.
- Yes?

172
00:16:40,779 --> 00:16:42,819
Did you hear what Prim said just now?

173
00:16:44,979 --> 00:16:46,819
I didn't hear it clearly.

174
00:16:49,602 --> 00:16:51,352
- Yong.
- Yes?

175
00:16:51,352 --> 00:16:52,354
Get back.

176
00:16:53,616 --> 00:16:54,616
Okay.

177
00:16:59,903 --> 00:17:01,865
What did you just say?
I couldn't hear it clearly.

178
00:17:02,407 --> 00:17:03,814
Boss, you're not my type.

179
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:10,548
That's impossible! I'm the type of guy
every woman in the world wants!

180
00:17:12,067 --> 00:17:15,460
But not for me, I don't like men like you.

181
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:19,579
I like someone who is empathetic, caring,
and kind to others.

182
00:17:21,169 --> 00:17:24,421
Well, that's me. Isn't it?

183
00:17:27,082 --> 00:17:28,084
Fine,

184
00:17:29,031 --> 00:17:30,117
you'll see.

185
00:17:30,117 --> 00:17:32,774
I'll show you that I'm the right one.

186
00:17:32,774 --> 00:17:35,222
I'll make you happy every single day.

187
00:17:35,222 --> 00:17:36,859
Today is just the appetizer.

188
00:17:36,859 --> 00:17:39,144
You haven't seen all the good things
I can offer yet.

189
00:17:40,665 --> 00:17:43,063
I hope you find someone who's right for you.

190
00:17:45,569 --> 00:17:47,129
What's wrong with you, Secretary Prim?!

191
00:17:47,129 --> 00:17:48,865
How can you say this to me?

192
00:17:48,865 --> 00:17:51,851
Am I not your type? You must be crazy!

193
00:17:51,851 --> 00:17:53,875
Secretary Prim! Secretary Prim!

194
00:17:58,067 --> 00:17:59,808
It's heavy, right?

195
00:18:18,627 --> 00:18:21,220
Meow Meow, what's wrong with him?

196
00:18:25,033 --> 00:18:26,111
What should we name it?

197
00:18:27,134 --> 00:18:29,491
Is "Fatty" a good name for such a heavy one?

198
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:35,579
Looks so sly, like someone
who's plotting something!

199
00:18:44,273 --> 00:18:45,804
What's the problem? What's going on?

200
00:18:45,804 --> 00:18:48,484
I was about to present to Boss.
How come we have problems now?

201
00:18:48,484 --> 00:18:51,409
Well, there's a big issue,
and then an even bigger one.

202
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:52,819
Which one do you want to hear first?

203
00:18:52,819 --> 00:18:54,978
Can I even choose? Just say whatever you want.

204
00:18:55,573 --> 00:18:56,963
Alright, say it.

205
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:59,471
The writers just called to tell me

206
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:02,930
they won't be attending our Valentine's
book reading event at the mall.

207
00:19:03,443 --> 00:19:04,539
How many people?

208
00:19:04,539 --> 00:19:06,218
- Everyone.
- What?

209
00:19:06,218 --> 00:19:10,973
There's a book fair that got rescheduled,
so everyone will go to that instead.

210
00:19:11,838 --> 00:19:13,871
- Wait, wait!
- Calm down, sis.

211
00:19:13,871 --> 00:19:15,919
We can ask the event organizing company to

212
00:19:15,919 --> 00:19:17,659
find a new writer to join the event instead.

213
00:19:17,659 --> 00:19:19,632
We have hired them,
so they should be able to handle it.

214
00:19:20,305 --> 00:19:23,699
Oh my god, my dear sweet book manager.
You're on it, okay?

215
00:19:23,699 --> 00:19:25,260
This can't be the solution.

216
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:26,654
Why not?

217
00:19:26,654 --> 00:19:29,340
Because the event company pulled out earlier.

218
00:19:31,706 --> 00:19:34,743
That's the bigger issue I wanted to tell you.

219
00:19:34,743 --> 00:19:38,072
I want to die!

220
00:19:38,072 --> 00:19:40,739
Why do all these problems have
to come together on the same day?

221
00:19:40,739 --> 00:19:42,015
Do I need to present to Boss?

222
00:19:42,015 --> 00:19:44,925
What if Boss finds out? How will he react?

223
00:19:44,925 --> 00:19:47,003
It's probably something like this.

224
00:19:47,778 --> 00:19:49,119
Oh my god!

225
00:19:49,119 --> 00:19:52,151
What… what… is… that? It's…

226
00:19:52,739 --> 00:19:55,174
I heard it all already.
Then no need for a meeting.

227
00:19:55,174 --> 00:19:57,240
Just make sure to fix the problem on time.

228
00:19:58,420 --> 00:19:59,962
Yes, yes.

229
00:20:00,846 --> 00:20:02,522
Oh no!

230
00:20:02,522 --> 00:20:05,453
Everyone, no time to waste!

231
00:20:05,453 --> 00:20:08,905
Let's find a new writer and
get a new event company to help us, quickly!

232
00:20:08,905 --> 00:20:10,215
Okay, okay!

233
00:20:22,993 --> 00:20:24,446
Oh, sorry! I'm late.

234
00:20:24,446 --> 00:20:26,734
No, it's okay, Kawee. No meeting anymore.

235
00:20:28,965 --> 00:20:32,472
It smells sour, like rotten socks again.

236
00:20:34,992 --> 00:20:37,779
Be careful! Are you okay?

237
00:20:37,779 --> 00:20:40,968
Can you stand? Oh, does it hurt?

238
00:20:41,684 --> 00:20:43,061
You idiot!

239
00:20:44,724 --> 00:20:45,891
Okay, are you alright?

240
00:20:45,891 --> 00:20:47,298
Yes, I'm okay.

241
00:21:02,209 --> 00:21:03,869
Oh no, I shouldn't have worn these shoes.

242
00:21:09,220 --> 00:21:10,220
Are you okay?

243
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:19,333
Actually, I could do it myself.

244
00:21:20,564 --> 00:21:23,041
Don't be stubborn. Let me help you.

245
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,971
I want to show you empathy, care, and kindness.

246
00:21:27,577 --> 00:21:28,931
So, I can be your type.

247
00:21:31,060 --> 00:21:33,622
But that needs to come from the heart.

248
00:21:34,246 --> 00:21:36,489
I'm doing it with 1000% of my heart!

249
00:21:37,674 --> 00:21:41,366
No, actually 999.99%.

250
00:21:41,366 --> 00:21:44,910
I still feel a little hurt by you.

251
00:21:53,909 --> 00:21:54,979
What are you doing?

252
00:21:56,905 --> 00:22:00,965
It's a trick my mom used
to do when I was young.

253
00:22:00,965 --> 00:22:03,660
She said it would help the wound heal faster.

254
00:22:10,153 --> 00:22:11,397
Thank you, Boss.

255
00:22:12,433 --> 00:22:15,325
If that's the case, I'll go help Bhum first.

256
00:22:15,839 --> 00:22:19,807
Better than staying with me here?

257
00:22:24,179 --> 00:22:26,350
If I don't hurry and help, it might get worse.

258
00:22:28,683 --> 00:22:31,398
It won't get worse. I know my staff well.

259
00:22:31,398 --> 00:22:33,539
They work perfectly, just like me.

260
00:22:34,625 --> 00:22:35,625
Alright.

261
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:42,601
Secretary Prim.

262
00:22:43,904 --> 00:22:45,022
I know…

263
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:50,402
I guessed that you like
"Bunga" (a type of sweet).

264
00:22:55,810 --> 00:22:56,810
So I got it for you.

265
00:23:01,141 --> 00:23:02,328
Or should I feed it to you?

266
00:23:04,666 --> 00:23:05,667
Thank you.

267
00:23:13,460 --> 00:23:14,461
Perfect!

268
00:23:20,619 --> 00:23:21,628
You're quirky,

269
00:23:23,241 --> 00:23:24,288
but it's cute.

270
00:23:26,544 --> 00:23:27,545
Sis Prim.

271
00:23:29,060 --> 00:23:30,100
Why are you so excited?

272
00:23:30,100 --> 00:23:31,970
I just got something important!

273
00:23:39,244 --> 00:23:41,999
Hey, Moon Shadow by Morpheus!

274
00:23:43,012 --> 00:23:44,478
You know about it?

275
00:23:45,213 --> 00:23:46,986
I'm a fan of Morpheus, too!

276
00:23:48,772 --> 00:23:51,691
My love probably wouldn't have reached…

277
00:23:51,691 --> 00:23:54,349
if you hadn't opened the door
waiting for me there.

278
00:23:56,316 --> 00:24:00,144
When I read that line, I screamed!
I don't know how he came up with it!

279
00:24:00,144 --> 00:24:03,994
And the one I got, it's the first edition!
The most important part is…

280
00:24:03,994 --> 00:24:08,251
It has Morpheus' signature.

281
00:24:08,251 --> 00:24:09,859
Oh, really?

282
00:24:09,859 --> 00:24:12,871
I wonder what he looks like.

283
00:24:12,871 --> 00:24:17,046
Right. Why does he stay so secretive,
not even revealing his face?

284
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,260
Yeah, but I heard from
the 'Love Morpheus' group that

285
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,288
Morpheus is currently staying in Thailand.

286
00:24:24,288 --> 00:24:25,288
Really?

287
00:24:25,867 --> 00:24:26,893
In Thailand?

288
00:24:26,893 --> 00:24:29,198
Can you hold onto the book for me, please?

289
00:24:29,198 --> 00:24:30,579
I'll be right back,
I need to go to the restroom.

290
00:24:30,579 --> 00:24:31,585
Sure.

291
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:36,193
Stay in Thailand?

292
00:24:42,226 --> 00:24:45,033
Secretary Prim, are you free this evening?

293
00:24:46,212 --> 00:24:47,572
Boss, do you have anything?

294
00:24:48,616 --> 00:24:50,550
No, I'm just hungry.

295
00:25:06,612 --> 00:25:09,425
Does Boss usually like to eat here?

296
00:25:11,020 --> 00:25:14,510
No, I was inspired
when I came to help your niece.

297
00:25:15,179 --> 00:25:16,792
So I ordered to close the place for you.

298
00:25:17,685 --> 00:25:18,685
Do you like it?

299
00:25:21,579 --> 00:25:22,579
Yes, I do.

300
00:25:23,593 --> 00:25:29,089
By the way, are we going to eat all of this?

301
00:25:30,704 --> 00:25:33,819
Of course,
I have been craving seafood for days.

302
00:25:36,511 --> 00:25:37,979
You also like seafood, right?

303
00:25:38,811 --> 00:25:39,812
Yes, I do.

304
00:25:40,912 --> 00:25:43,761
Wait, did I ever tell you that I like it?

305
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:50,047
I guessed it. Is that correct?

306
00:25:52,524 --> 00:25:53,671
Eat it. I'm hungry.

307
00:25:55,618 --> 00:25:56,622
Wait!

308
00:25:57,936 --> 00:25:59,096
I'll peel the shrimp for you.

309
00:26:17,047 --> 00:26:18,786
It has to be eaten with coconut.

310
00:26:35,642 --> 00:26:38,180
Don't you want to eat?
Would you prefer dessert first?

311
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:57,431
Is it a tourism survey?

312
00:26:59,785 --> 00:27:03,722
<i>[If you and your partner have limited time,
where would you like to travel?]</i>

313
00:27:05,263 --> 00:27:06,263
Aquarium.

314
00:27:07,807 --> 00:27:12,548
<i>[Quickly think, what gift would you
like to receive from your partner?]</i>

315
00:27:14,488 --> 00:27:16,490
How is this related to travel?

316
00:27:22,919 --> 00:27:23,919
Okay, okay.

317
00:27:27,150 --> 00:27:29,019
A goldfish doll.

318
00:27:31,500 --> 00:27:35,001
<i>[What type of restaurant would
you like to go to with your partner?]</i>

319
00:27:35,516 --> 00:27:37,027
Seafood restaurant.

320
00:27:37,027 --> 00:27:40,637
<i>[A moment when your partner does
something and you think it's so cute?]</i>

321
00:27:40,637 --> 00:27:42,950
Peeling shrimp and crab for you.

322
00:27:45,156 --> 00:27:46,853
Peeling coconut for you.

323
00:27:49,231 --> 00:27:51,265
Peeling durian would be even better.

324
00:27:55,304 --> 00:27:57,290
Oh, Mr. Bear, the pen!

325
00:28:03,783 --> 00:28:07,020
You make that face
because you understand me the most, right?

326
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:09,693
How do you know?

327
00:28:10,967 --> 00:28:12,567
Well, that's it, I don't know either.

328
00:28:13,457 --> 00:28:17,895
I might be the person who understands you
the most, in a way that no one else could.

329
00:28:19,152 --> 00:28:21,052
Still thinking of
leaving me for someone else?

330
00:28:22,291 --> 00:28:23,500
That's really a shame.

331
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:32,215
I need to talk about work for a bit.

332
00:28:33,575 --> 00:28:34,664
Sure, go ahead.

333
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:41,383
I want to introduce a writer I like to
replace the writer we missed the deal with.

334
00:28:41,383 --> 00:28:43,020
This person is world-famous.

335
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:46,215
His book even made it to
the New York Post Best Seller list.

336
00:28:46,215 --> 00:28:48,418
And now, I heard he's in Thailand too.

337
00:28:49,427 --> 00:28:51,567
Really? Who is he? What's his name?

338
00:28:52,226 --> 00:28:53,639
I'll show you the info in a moment.

339
00:29:17,893 --> 00:29:19,659
Here, he uses the pen name Morpheus…

340
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:25,110
Are you following me?

341
00:29:37,068 --> 00:29:38,068
Following you?

342
00:29:40,112 --> 00:29:43,739
Do you think you came here alone?
Don't you know what coincidence means?

343
00:29:43,739 --> 00:29:46,134
No, I think it's not a coincidence.

344
00:29:49,104 --> 00:29:50,105
Fine.

345
00:29:51,604 --> 00:29:54,480
I heard you calling your mom and
contacting someone to close this place.

346
00:29:55,006 --> 00:29:56,692
So, I followed to see.

347
00:30:00,914 --> 00:30:04,001
If you don't want to talk to me,
you don't have to come up to me.

348
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,541
Just pretend you didn't see me.

349
00:30:07,976 --> 00:30:10,152
Or maybe you really have something
you want to tell me.

350
00:30:10,671 --> 00:30:11,671
Go ahead.

351
00:30:14,311 --> 00:30:17,038
Would you like me to sit at the table too?
That could be fun.

352
00:30:19,216 --> 00:30:21,896
Oh, sorry, I won't invite you.

353
00:30:22,993 --> 00:30:24,399
Because you're with a woman, right?

354
00:30:25,222 --> 00:30:27,302
The woman who took the taxi that day?

355
00:30:28,453 --> 00:30:29,603
I'd really like to meet her.

356
00:30:33,492 --> 00:30:35,259
Don't get involved with my business.

357
00:30:51,569 --> 00:30:53,209
Where did the Vice President go just now?

358
00:30:54,436 --> 00:30:55,726
Is there something going on?

359
00:30:58,425 --> 00:30:59,425
It's nothing.

360
00:31:00,241 --> 00:31:03,254
As for the writer,
you can present it to me tomorrow.

361
00:31:10,165 --> 00:31:11,492
Do you want to ride the carousel?

362
00:32:03,794 --> 00:32:06,660
Babe, he left me.

363
00:32:12,476 --> 00:32:14,123
It's time to get drunk.

364
00:32:15,676 --> 00:32:18,861
There, it's okay.
Come on, let's go to the room.

365
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:20,963
Let's go to the room. There, there.

366
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:29,517
There, don't cry.

367
00:32:31,069 --> 00:32:34,108
Babe, he cheated on me! How dare he!

368
00:32:34,108 --> 00:32:38,616
How could he do this to someone like me?

369
00:32:38,616 --> 00:32:41,637
You jerk! You scum! You…

370
00:32:43,656 --> 00:32:47,998
Please censor that. The neighbors
in the next room might be shocked.

371
00:32:51,668 --> 00:32:52,676
Prim.

372
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,841
You! Don't bother having a boyfriend.

373
00:32:56,857 --> 00:32:58,803
Stay single until you die,
it's better that way.

374
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:06,234
Then you won't have to feel the pain
and the suffering like I do.

375
00:33:10,207 --> 00:33:11,728
Oh, eat, eat. Go ahead, eat.

376
00:33:14,062 --> 00:33:16,420
By the way, do you have one yet?

377
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,864
Have what?

378
00:33:17,864 --> 00:33:20,324
Oh, your soulmate!

379
00:33:20,324 --> 00:33:26,052
Dr. Tawan, the one with the six-pack abs,
toned muscles, and pink nipples.

380
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:28,323
Oh, let's forget about that for now.

381
00:33:28,323 --> 00:33:30,899
Right now, I'm more stressed
about my office friends.

382
00:33:30,899 --> 00:33:32,691
What are you stressed about?

383
00:33:33,390 --> 00:33:36,090
Well, there's supposed to
be a Valentine's event.

384
00:33:36,090 --> 00:33:37,894
But the company's having problems

385
00:33:37,894 --> 00:33:41,420
because the writer and
the event company are booked.

386
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:43,304
I don't know if we'll
find someone else in time.

387
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:45,076
I can do it!

388
00:33:46,527 --> 00:33:48,260
I am an event organizer, Prim.

389
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:50,779
Oh, I totally forgot about you!

390
00:33:52,330 --> 00:33:54,198
Even my friends forget about me.

391
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:06,526
That sounds interesting.
Let's schedule a meeting to talk about it.

392
00:34:07,985 --> 00:34:08,985
Okay.

393
00:34:11,791 --> 00:34:14,443
So, how about the writer you like?

394
00:34:16,340 --> 00:34:18,819
Let me try contacting him again.

395
00:34:26,644 --> 00:34:27,662
Is something wrong?

396
00:34:29,831 --> 00:34:30,831
No,

397
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:35,201
I just want you to keep smiling at me
for as long as possible.

398
00:34:54,311 --> 00:34:56,819
<i>I'm in the lobby, about to go up to see you.</i>

399
00:35:03,479 --> 00:35:04,566
Secretary Prim.

400
00:35:04,566 --> 00:35:05,587
Yes?

401
00:35:05,587 --> 00:35:06,599
Go buy something for me.

402
00:35:07,807 --> 00:35:10,008
Sure. What would you like, sir?

403
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:12,895
It doesn't matter what you buy,
but I don't want you to use the elevator.

404
00:35:13,541 --> 00:35:14,541
What?

405
00:35:14,541 --> 00:35:16,583
I feel like you haven't
been exercising much lately.

406
00:35:17,089 --> 00:35:18,416
Walk down the fire escape stairs.

407
00:35:20,303 --> 00:35:21,550
19 floors, though.

408
00:35:21,550 --> 00:35:23,120
Then you can go up to the 20th floor,

409
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,812
and then come back down in one go.

410
00:35:26,447 --> 00:35:27,476
Okay.

411
00:35:27,476 --> 00:35:28,507
Now go!

412
00:35:28,507 --> 00:35:29,510
Okay.

413
00:35:37,072 --> 00:35:38,598
What's going on? Crazy.

414
00:36:06,407 --> 00:36:08,067
This room is so luxurious,

415
00:36:08,806 --> 00:36:10,336
I'd love to work in a place like this.

416
00:36:12,612 --> 00:36:13,692
What's your business here?

417
00:36:16,117 --> 00:36:18,121
I came to the meeting
at the nearby printing press.

418
00:36:19,046 --> 00:36:20,939
They just printed the fifth edition of my book,

419
00:36:22,134 --> 00:36:23,340
so I stopped by to deliver it.

420
00:36:23,340 --> 00:36:24,619
I don't have time to read it.

421
00:36:30,306 --> 00:36:33,262
Even if you do, you probably
wouldn't care to read it, right?

422
00:36:35,292 --> 00:36:36,593
You have no heart.

423
00:36:37,604 --> 00:36:38,724
You have never been in love,

424
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,476
so you probably won't like it.

425
00:36:42,476 --> 00:36:43,477
I already knew that.

426
00:36:45,053 --> 00:36:46,053
Are you done?

427
00:36:47,261 --> 00:36:48,263
I'll get back to work.

428
00:37:10,325 --> 00:37:13,299
<i>["Two of Us" in Thai, 5th edition]</i>

429
00:37:13,299 --> 00:37:15,692
<i>The past will either be a beautiful memory</i>

430
00:37:16,226 --> 00:37:18,988
<i>or turn into a demon
that haunts and follows us,</i>

431
00:37:20,173 --> 00:37:21,230
<i>depending on ourselves.</i>

432
00:37:31,373 --> 00:37:32,373
Oh, you.

433
00:37:33,942 --> 00:37:35,068
- Hospital!
- Hospital!

434
00:37:36,906 --> 00:37:38,234
I didn't expect to see you again.

435
00:37:39,739 --> 00:37:40,845
I'm glad you remember me.

436
00:37:41,675 --> 00:37:42,975
Do you work here?

437
00:37:42,975 --> 00:37:45,169
No. I'm here to visit my younger brother.

438
00:37:47,558 --> 00:37:50,901
Anyway, thank you so
much for saving my life that day.

439
00:37:51,426 --> 00:37:52,628
It's nothing. My pleasure.

440
00:37:53,245 --> 00:37:54,605
Well then, I'll take my leave now.

441
00:37:56,303 --> 00:37:57,303
Wait a moment.

442
00:37:59,522 --> 00:38:01,594
Can I have your number?

443
00:38:03,533 --> 00:38:04,539
You…

444
00:38:05,292 --> 00:38:08,816
I'm sorry. I'm not
comfortable giving it out right now.

445
00:38:17,948 --> 00:38:21,137
Well, here's my number.
If you need anything, feel free to call me.

446
00:38:22,986 --> 00:38:23,990
Okay.

447
00:38:24,643 --> 00:38:25,890
Well then, I'll be going.

448
00:38:33,167 --> 00:38:34,171
Primala…

449
00:38:36,912 --> 00:38:38,979
Looks delicious! Is this grilled pork skewers?

450
00:38:38,979 --> 00:38:39,983
It's so perfect!

451
00:38:42,109 --> 00:38:44,073
That's Mr.Kawee, isn't it?

452
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:47,323
Did you hear something?

453
00:38:48,346 --> 00:38:51,597
My heart is racing faster than the
caffeine in this cup!

454
00:38:55,498 --> 00:38:56,967
He's so handsome!

455
00:38:58,087 --> 00:39:01,265
So adorable. Look, he's using a tiffin carrier!

456
00:39:01,265 --> 00:39:03,436
And he even brought his own water bottle.

457
00:39:09,559 --> 00:39:13,420
Oh my god, he's good-looking and eco-friendly!

458
00:39:14,426 --> 00:39:16,808
This is crazy!

459
00:39:17,558 --> 00:39:18,581
Such a cutie!

460
00:39:18,581 --> 00:39:20,771
But no matter how eco-friendly someone is,

461
00:39:20,771 --> 00:39:22,797
isn't it a bit weird to always
wear the same shirt?

462
00:39:24,044 --> 00:39:25,049
Wear the same shirt?

463
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,600
Well, that shirt Kawee has been wearing.

464
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:31,556
He always wears the same,

465
00:39:31,556 --> 00:39:33,200
doesn't anyone notice?

466
00:39:37,106 --> 00:39:42,722
Mind, don't you know the style of
Steve Jobs or Mark Zuckerberg?

467
00:39:45,551 --> 00:39:49,213
This new kid is so naive.

468
00:39:49,725 --> 00:39:50,726
Listen to me.

469
00:39:51,366 --> 00:39:54,272
A guy like Kawee, he's a thinker.

470
00:39:54,792 --> 00:39:57,945
He needs his brain power to create things.

471
00:39:57,945 --> 00:40:00,899
He doesn't waste his brain power thinking

472
00:40:00,899 --> 00:40:02,876
about what shirt to wear each day.

473
00:40:02,876 --> 00:40:06,149
Look at that expensive leather
shirt he's wearing.

474
00:40:06,149 --> 00:40:10,336
I can tell you, he probably has
a dozen of those in his closet.

475
00:40:10,336 --> 00:40:13,373
He doesn't need to mix and match or anything.

476
00:40:13,373 --> 00:40:15,778
The food he's bringing,
he's already counted the calories.

477
00:40:15,778 --> 00:40:18,354
He knows how many calories
he needs for the day.

478
00:40:18,354 --> 00:40:22,226
And look at that water bottle,
it must be room temperature.

479
00:40:22,226 --> 00:40:24,918
That's the lifestyle of a smart person.

480
00:40:27,470 --> 00:40:30,175
Well, Bhum, you seem to know Kawee really well.

481
00:40:30,955 --> 00:40:35,220
How wouldn't she? She has been secretly
watching him from the gutter all the time!

482
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:37,608
Then, at night, I go rummaging
through the trash to eat.

483
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:40,330
Not even a cockroach could do that!

484
00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:44,976
Speaking of which, a guy like him

485
00:40:44,976 --> 00:40:48,659
must like a woman who's in a chic look like me,

486
00:40:48,659 --> 00:40:50,142
an older sister with charm and grace.

487
00:40:52,297 --> 00:40:54,218
I should go try my luck
and flirt with him a bit.

488
00:40:59,983 --> 00:41:01,340
Bhum, are you okay?

489
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,657
I'm in love, darling!

490
00:41:19,932 --> 00:41:20,938
Yes, Mom.

491
00:41:22,472 --> 00:41:23,476
No, I'm not going.

492
00:41:24,466 --> 00:41:25,638
I'm busy…

493
00:41:25,638 --> 00:41:27,209
We already met during Chinese New Year.

494
00:41:28,726 --> 00:41:30,332
That's all for now, I have to work.

495
00:41:42,905 --> 00:41:46,372
I like the Valentine's event format
your friend came up with.

496
00:41:46,372 --> 00:41:48,075
Minimal but really cute.

497
00:41:49,052 --> 00:41:50,099
Thank you!

498
00:41:50,099 --> 00:41:51,741
Regarding the writer,

499
00:41:51,741 --> 00:41:54,741
I have sent an email to the publishing house
and am waiting for their reply.

500
00:41:58,293 --> 00:41:59,340
I'm sorry, sir.

501
00:42:16,340 --> 00:42:18,452
You normally adjust my necktie.

502
00:42:19,919 --> 00:42:21,524
But today I feel something is different.

503
00:42:22,558 --> 00:42:23,561
What's different?

504
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:27,359
There's a sound. A certain sound coming out.

505
00:42:29,083 --> 00:42:30,139
What sound?

506
00:42:32,569 --> 00:42:33,680
The sound of my heart.

507
00:42:43,599 --> 00:42:45,052
I'll go back to work now.

508
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:55,924
The door should be pushed, right?

509
00:42:58,049 --> 00:42:59,101
You're right!

510
00:43:16,009 --> 00:43:17,401
Oh my gosh, what's this?

511
00:43:18,274 --> 00:43:19,821
It's not supposed to be like this.

512
00:43:32,280 --> 00:43:33,728
Hello, Madam Chollada.

513
00:43:36,473 --> 00:43:37,501
Really?

514
00:43:41,289 --> 00:43:42,322
Okay. Bye!

515
00:43:45,537 --> 00:43:48,204
Oh, you're here! You're here!

516
00:43:51,047 --> 00:43:52,089
Oh no! I messed up!

517
00:43:52,089 --> 00:43:53,823
What? Messed up?

518
00:43:53,823 --> 00:43:57,945
I'm from Ban Pong.
You know, Miss Grand Ratchaburi!

519
00:43:59,193 --> 00:44:01,142
Here's today's slogan:

520
00:44:01,142 --> 00:44:04,245
Friends must be cared for.
If you have a lover, I need to know!

521
00:44:04,245 --> 00:44:06,562
Where's the care? Who are you talking to?

522
00:44:07,332 --> 00:44:08,337
Want to know?

523
00:44:11,204 --> 00:44:12,364
None of your business. Nosey!

524
00:44:15,221 --> 00:44:17,108
"Nosey" equals "butting in".

525
00:44:18,056 --> 00:44:20,216
Now that I have been scolded,
I have the right to know!

526
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:32,954
Are you leaving now?

527
00:44:33,789 --> 00:44:36,275
Here's your bag that Madam Chollada
sent for repair.

528
00:44:36,275 --> 00:44:38,650
She asked you to take it back to her house.

529
00:44:39,645 --> 00:44:40,885
You have to go, right?

530
00:44:45,079 --> 00:44:46,082
Thank you so much.

531
00:44:46,859 --> 00:44:48,752
Sorry that my mom bothered you.

532
00:44:49,996 --> 00:44:51,470
It's no trouble at all.

533
00:44:51,470 --> 00:44:53,523
If that's the case, I'll excuse myself.

534
00:45:02,278 --> 00:45:03,692
So, Mom used this method, right?

535
00:45:09,917 --> 00:45:11,277
I'll be waiting at the same place.

536
00:45:12,265 --> 00:45:14,009
Where we met before, up there.

537
00:45:14,764 --> 00:45:15,766
Okay.

538
00:45:20,845 --> 00:45:22,340
Darling, have you been waiting long?

539
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,220
I have been waiting for a while.
Did you get lost?

540
00:45:24,220 --> 00:45:25,819
It was hard to find parking.

541
00:45:25,819 --> 00:45:27,220
I'm hungry too. Let's go get something to eat.

542
00:45:27,220 --> 00:45:28,223
Wait a second.

543
00:45:34,027 --> 00:45:35,027
Well, I wait.

544
00:45:44,193 --> 00:45:45,373
Hello!

545
00:45:45,373 --> 00:45:46,613
Is it you, Sis Bhum?

546
00:45:46,613 --> 00:45:47,757
Yeah.

547
00:45:48,317 --> 00:45:50,234
Where are you?

548
00:45:50,901 --> 00:45:54,060
I'm at the office.

549
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:58,804
Oh really? Why are you at the office?
Why does the sound seem so close?

550
00:45:59,426 --> 00:46:00,795
Oh, really?

551
00:46:00,795 --> 00:46:03,606
I have something to tell you.

552
00:46:03,606 --> 00:46:04,755
What?

553
00:46:05,717 --> 00:46:07,632
I saw you with my own eyes!

554
00:46:09,367 --> 00:46:11,412
You tried to hide, but the glass was so clear.

555
00:46:12,097 --> 00:46:13,834
Always be nosey.

556
00:46:15,688 --> 00:46:17,444
Always meddling in other people's business.

557
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:19,122
Just talking to a friend. It's normal.

558
00:46:27,945 --> 00:46:29,733
Oh, PenJa.

559
00:46:30,498 --> 00:46:32,900
I didn't bring the cake for you.

560
00:46:34,186 --> 00:46:35,899
Sorry, Yong.

561
00:46:38,552 --> 00:46:39,996
Sorry, Yong.

562
00:46:42,669 --> 00:46:43,675
That's okay.

563
00:46:46,437 --> 00:46:47,456
Miss Bhum.

564
00:46:47,456 --> 00:46:48,536
- Yes?
- Please have a seat.

565
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:50,378
- Sit down?
- Yes, please.

566
00:46:50,378 --> 00:46:51,613
- Why?
- Please.

567
00:46:54,239 --> 00:46:55,239
Yong, what are you doing?

568
00:46:56,265 --> 00:46:58,380
Oh no, don't, don't!

569
00:46:58,380 --> 00:47:00,865
Miss Bhum, please don't
walk around like this with such a mess.

570
00:47:01,995 --> 00:47:03,492
It's okay.

571
00:47:03,492 --> 00:47:06,598
Look, the handkerchief's pattern is
even sweeter than mine! What a waste.

572
00:47:08,331 --> 00:47:09,547
PenJa made it for me.

573
00:47:13,163 --> 00:47:14,676
Hey, please don't, don't.

574
00:47:14,676 --> 00:47:16,806
I'll clean it up myself at home.
Yong, no, stop!

575
00:47:16,806 --> 00:47:21,232
Oh, how cute! Cleaning the shoes for your girl.

576
00:47:21,232 --> 00:47:22,247
So sweet!

577
00:47:24,340 --> 00:47:26,748
No sweet, sweet stuff at all!

578
00:47:26,748 --> 00:47:29,433
We're not a couple. I'm still single.

579
00:47:29,433 --> 00:47:31,873
Just go wherever you're going,
follow your own path.

580
00:47:32,600 --> 00:47:33,600
Please.

581
00:47:35,288 --> 00:47:37,192
They have misunderstood everything, Yong.

582
00:47:37,192 --> 00:47:39,076
Enough, no need to clean anymore.

583
00:47:40,338 --> 00:47:41,338
I have to go.

584
00:47:42,249 --> 00:47:43,249
I am really sorry.

585
00:47:44,288 --> 00:47:45,448
I'm leaving now, really.

586
00:48:02,441 --> 00:48:03,441
Mom,

587
00:48:04,914 --> 00:48:06,160
I have brought the bag for you.

588
00:48:07,018 --> 00:48:08,589
If there's nothing else,

589
00:48:09,873 --> 00:48:10,878
I'll take my leave.

590
00:48:10,878 --> 00:48:12,288
Don't rush back, sweetheart.

591
00:48:12,888 --> 00:48:14,566
Stay and eat with us first.

592
00:48:30,268 --> 00:48:31,274
Aren't you eating?

593
00:48:32,139 --> 00:48:34,470
Just sitting there, watching
them eat and smile.

594
00:48:36,501 --> 00:48:38,013
Well then, let me feed you.

595
00:48:39,199 --> 00:48:40,630
That's funny, isn't it?

596
00:48:40,630 --> 00:48:43,343
What's funny? Just romances.

597
00:48:44,415 --> 00:48:45,433
Right?

598
00:48:45,433 --> 00:48:46,540
Eat a little, please.

599
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:49,293
If you don't eat, I'll feed you myself.
Here you go.

600
00:48:49,293 --> 00:48:51,479
No, just eat it.

601
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:52,494
I…

602
00:48:52,494 --> 00:48:55,821
Just sitting and watching you eat,
I am already full.

603
00:48:56,522 --> 00:48:57,527
You…

604
00:48:58,968 --> 00:48:59,968
You what?

605
00:49:00,469 --> 00:49:03,180
This has been your catchphrase for a long time.

606
00:49:03,180 --> 00:49:04,819
I remember it clearly.

607
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,323
Then what's your catchphrase?

608
00:49:10,512 --> 00:49:12,460
Okay, dear. I know.

609
00:49:12,460 --> 00:49:14,679
I'll do anything for you.

610
00:49:15,779 --> 00:49:17,691
That's great.

611
00:49:19,739 --> 00:49:23,132
Eating together like this is really nice.

612
00:49:23,132 --> 00:49:26,247
Thee, you should have invited Prim too.

613
00:49:27,191 --> 00:49:28,191
Prim?

614
00:49:28,942 --> 00:49:29,943
Who is she?

615
00:49:30,835 --> 00:49:32,165
Or…

616
00:49:32,165 --> 00:49:33,394
Thee's secretary.

617
00:49:34,092 --> 00:49:36,676
She's the one who takes care of Thee the best.

618
00:49:37,640 --> 00:49:41,340
Takes care of him so well that I want her
to get promoted to something else.

619
00:49:42,392 --> 00:49:46,609
See? I told you. I didn't say that.

620
00:49:46,609 --> 00:49:48,591
How many times do I have to tell you?

621
00:49:48,591 --> 00:49:51,913
You didn't, but I did.

622
00:49:51,913 --> 00:49:53,312
Secretary Prim?

623
00:49:54,863 --> 00:49:56,424
I really want to see her face.

624
00:49:57,605 --> 00:49:59,489
She's so cute.

625
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:04,331
If so, we'll invite Prim
to eat with us next time.

626
00:50:04,331 --> 00:50:05,337
Don't mess with her.

627
00:50:11,312 --> 00:50:12,314
I'm not that hungry.

628
00:50:12,905 --> 00:50:14,859
I have got work to do. I'll head out now.

629
00:50:35,471 --> 00:50:36,594
What would you like to have?

630
00:50:37,773 --> 00:50:39,132
What's the cheapest?

631
00:50:39,132 --> 00:50:40,908
It's yam, 6 baht per kilo.

632
00:50:41,546 --> 00:50:43,808
Okay, I'll take 200 grams of yam.

633
00:50:45,169 --> 00:50:46,429
- 200 grams?
- Yes,

634
00:50:47,341 --> 00:50:48,621
please wash and peel it as well.

635
00:50:49,131 --> 00:50:50,160
200 grams?

636
00:50:50,160 --> 00:50:51,164
Yes.

637
00:51:15,923 --> 00:51:17,063
What would you like to have?

638
00:51:19,387 --> 00:51:22,079
I'll take one durian, please.

639
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:23,393
- One pack, please.
- Okay.

640
00:51:27,493 --> 00:51:28,493
One moment, please.

641
00:51:29,705 --> 00:51:33,223
Yes, Mom, I'm buying durian near the office.

642
00:51:34,607 --> 00:51:36,268
Mom, I have grown up now.

643
00:51:38,200 --> 00:51:39,630
Don't worry.

644
00:51:42,626 --> 00:51:46,472
Okay, so if I move into the condo,
what will you do, Mom?

645
00:51:48,479 --> 00:51:53,613
Okay, do you want anything? No? Okay, then.

646
00:51:57,159 --> 00:51:59,859
Well, then, I'll peel it for you.
I'll come back to pick it up.

647
00:51:59,859 --> 00:52:03,251
Okay. I'll peel it and put it in a bag.

648
00:52:06,340 --> 00:52:07,502
What's wrong with this girl?!

649
00:52:10,693 --> 00:52:12,576
Let's reschedule the meeting for tomorrow, Pat.

650
00:52:14,339 --> 00:52:16,938
I'm not mad, just a little irritated.

651
00:52:19,071 --> 00:52:20,751
What's the matter? You don't need to know.

652
00:52:21,260 --> 00:52:23,187
Why? Is the food not good?

653
00:52:25,231 --> 00:52:26,231
That's all for now.

654
00:52:27,892 --> 00:52:29,617
Or is it because I'm sitting here with you?

655
00:52:30,880 --> 00:52:33,257
Or do you want me to order
the Greek salad you like as well?

656
00:52:33,257 --> 00:52:35,977
It's just because I'm not hungry,
not for any other reason, you know?

657
00:52:37,789 --> 00:52:40,093
Even after work, you're still working?

658
00:52:40,093 --> 00:52:42,009
No wonder you always look so stressed.

659
00:52:43,329 --> 00:52:46,416
How has your secretary been able
to deal with you all these years?

660
00:52:47,447 --> 00:52:48,920
I really want to see her face.

661
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:50,293
Why would you want to know?

662
00:52:51,885 --> 00:52:52,889
It's nothing.

663
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:55,686
I wanted to find a way
for you to finally talk to me.

664
00:52:56,612 --> 00:52:58,213
When are you going to talk to me nicely?

665
00:53:00,472 --> 00:53:01,475
What's wrong with you?

666
00:53:02,952 --> 00:53:05,332
I have been trying to be a
good older brother all this time.

667
00:53:05,885 --> 00:53:09,211
You should be thanking me
for never getting mad at you!

668
00:53:11,153 --> 00:53:12,153
So what?

669
00:53:13,169 --> 00:53:16,118
I have forgiven you, don't you get it?

670
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:22,695
If that day hadn't happened, the place

671
00:53:23,326 --> 00:53:26,212
where you're standing in right now
would be mine!

672
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:28,199
Are you serious?

673
00:53:29,466 --> 00:53:30,681
Let me tell you something.

674
00:53:31,480 --> 00:53:34,225
You're both weak and incompetent.

675
00:53:34,225 --> 00:53:37,295
Even if that day hadn't happened,
you would never have come as far as I have.

676
00:53:49,125 --> 00:53:52,717
Thee! Tham! Stop it, guys! Stop it, Thee!

677
00:53:55,380 --> 00:53:56,695
Stop, stop right now!

678
00:53:59,268 --> 00:54:00,754
What the hell is wrong with you two?

679
00:54:08,615 --> 00:54:09,808
- Does it hurt?
- No.

680
00:54:14,705 --> 00:54:15,705
Thee…

681
00:54:48,063 --> 00:54:49,339
What's up, Pong?

682
00:54:49,339 --> 00:54:51,094
<i>Tham, check your email.</i>

683
00:54:51,665 --> 00:54:55,122
<i>Someone contacted us about you
attending a Valentine's Day Book Event.</i>

684
00:54:56,623 --> 00:54:58,503
I don't want to go, Pong. Just decline it.

685
00:54:59,560 --> 00:55:00,930
<i>Please read it first, Tham.</i>

686
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:04,995
<i>Please, I'm asking you. If you still want
to decline after that, we'll figure it out.</i>

687
00:55:18,899 --> 00:55:21,205
Secretary to Vice President,

688
00:55:23,270 --> 00:55:24,272
Primala.

689
00:55:35,553 --> 00:55:38,352
Yeah, Giow, Boss likes your work.
Send the quote over.

690
00:55:39,471 --> 00:55:41,245
What? You're going to work for no money?

691
00:55:41,245 --> 00:55:43,667
You want a kiss from
the Vice President instead? You.

692
00:55:45,545 --> 00:55:47,320
I won't kiss anyone except you.

693
00:55:58,693 --> 00:55:59,693
Excuse me,

694
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,725
but what happened to your face?

695
00:56:10,940 --> 00:56:12,859
Oh, please wait a moment, sir.

696
00:56:34,644 --> 00:56:35,784
Come on, sir. Come…

697
00:56:47,686 --> 00:56:48,775
You have a seat here.

698
00:56:49,415 --> 00:56:52,794
I'll go get some medicine to treat the wound.

699
00:57:18,592 --> 00:57:20,839
You really have a goldfish as a companion?

700
00:57:22,916 --> 00:57:24,438
Yes, its name is Meow Meow.

701
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:26,324
Meow Meow?

702
00:57:28,070 --> 00:57:31,358
Actually, I wanted to have a cat.
But they don't allow pets in the condo,

703
00:57:31,861 --> 00:57:32,936
so I can only have fish.

704
00:57:34,999 --> 00:57:36,899
But it's fine, though,
because when I was a kid,

705
00:57:36,899 --> 00:57:40,485
my mom used to say I had chubby cheeks
and always made a pouting face too.

706
00:57:41,267 --> 00:57:42,274
Pouting face?

707
00:57:43,386 --> 00:57:44,386
It's like this, you know.

708
00:57:49,152 --> 00:57:50,696
It's a cute little pouting face.

709
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:54,488
Why do you want to show me how to do it?

710
00:57:57,175 --> 00:57:58,905
Let's just treat the wound, Vice President.

711
00:59:13,000 --> 00:59:15,455
Boss, Boss!

712
00:59:22,412 --> 00:59:23,412
Am I imagining things?

713
00:59:24,009 --> 00:59:25,009
What are you thinking?

714
00:59:27,141 --> 00:59:28,141
What did you say?

715
00:59:29,666 --> 00:59:32,219
I was asking if the medicine
you're applying hurts.

716
00:59:33,225 --> 00:59:34,539
No, it doesn't hurt.

717
00:59:36,299 --> 00:59:37,376
Then it's all done!

718
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:40,819
Such a pity.

719
00:59:40,819 --> 00:59:41,979
What do you feel sorry about?

720
00:59:48,745 --> 00:59:49,865
Thank you, Prim.

721
01:00:07,032 --> 01:00:08,361
Vice President, what's wrong now?

722
01:00:09,545 --> 01:00:12,054
Does Meow Meow usually swim
in the breaststroke?

723
01:00:13,346 --> 01:00:14,348
Not really.

724
01:00:17,072 --> 01:00:18,177
Meow Meow!

725
01:00:22,711 --> 01:00:26,105
Meow Meow. I'm sorry.

726
01:00:26,105 --> 01:00:28,524
Please don't be…

727
01:00:28,524 --> 01:00:31,470
I'm sorry for not taking good care of you…

728
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,890
Prim, calm down. We're almost there.

729
01:00:34,890 --> 01:00:39,576
I can't even take care of one fish properly.

730
01:00:39,576 --> 01:00:41,351
I'm really bad at this…

731
01:00:45,219 --> 01:00:46,500
Meow Meow, please don't be hurt.

732
01:00:46,500 --> 01:00:47,992
We're here, Prim. There's the clinic.

733
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:56,235
We're here, Meow Meow.

734
01:00:57,219 --> 01:01:00,500
Help me, I don't know
what's wrong with my goldfish.

735
01:01:02,855 --> 01:01:03,855
Miss Prim.

736
01:01:07,287 --> 01:01:08,290
Dr. Tawan.

737
01:01:36,241 --> 01:01:37,328
How's Meow Meow doing?

738
01:01:37,878 --> 01:01:39,361
The fish has anchorworm disease.

739
01:01:40,229 --> 01:01:41,392
And it can be treated, right?

740
01:01:41,392 --> 01:01:43,206
It's not serious, right?

741
01:01:44,153 --> 01:01:45,497
It can definitely be treated.

742
01:01:46,056 --> 01:01:48,262
My fish, the one with
bulging eyes, had it too.

743
01:01:48,262 --> 01:01:49,985
Now, it's all better.

744
01:01:50,779 --> 01:01:53,086
Tonight, please leave Meow Meow with me.

745
01:01:54,762 --> 01:01:56,935
It will definitely get better, right?

746
01:01:57,465 --> 01:01:58,931
It will definitely get better.

747
01:01:58,931 --> 01:02:00,768
I'll keep checking on its condition.

748
01:02:00,768 --> 01:02:02,415
You can go home first.

749
01:02:06,058 --> 01:02:07,419
Do you want me to give you a ride?

750
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:14,417
No need. I brought Prim here myself,
so I'll take her home.

751
01:02:14,417 --> 01:02:15,968
Thank you very much, Doctor.

752
01:02:32,205 --> 01:02:33,453
I didn't give you a ride today,

753
01:02:33,993 --> 01:02:35,913
but on Valentine's Day,
I'll come to pick you up.

754
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:43,495
On Valentine's Day,
let's go have dinner together.

755
01:03:10,302 --> 01:03:13,847
I'll use this Valentine's Day
atmosphere to let Prim absorb

756
01:03:13,847 --> 01:03:18,366
and reveal that she really
likes me, as I really think.

757
01:03:18,366 --> 01:03:23,238
Your boss is so rich
and has a lifestyle different from ours.

758
01:03:23,238 --> 01:03:25,653
Would he choose someone like us?

759
01:03:25,653 --> 01:03:27,212
Is he your favorite author?

760
01:03:27,212 --> 01:03:30,299
If it weren't for him, we wouldn't
have any authors to work with time.

761
01:03:30,299 --> 01:03:31,421
Cancel it.

762
01:03:31,421 --> 01:03:33,207
- Or, are you afraid?
- Afraid of what?

763
01:03:33,207 --> 01:03:35,323
Afraid that I'll steal
your secretary away from you.
